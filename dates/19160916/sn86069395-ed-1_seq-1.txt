Republican Committee Gives
Judge Charles H. Bush
Opposition.
NAMED HERE THURSDAY
Nominee Is Young Lawyer of
This City, 39 .Years
of Age.
The Republican District Committee
of the Third judicial district met in
this city Thursday and nominated Sam
T. Fruit for circuit judge.
Those present were McJ. Davis,
committeeman for Christian; J. F.
Ramey, committeeman for Lyon; Bur
nett, for Trigg, and W. C. Osburn,
committeeman for Calloway county.
Capt. McJ. Davis was made chair
man and John reianct secretary ot
the committee.
There was but one candidate and
the nomination was put through, with
out a hitch. The nomination came as
a complete surprise as Mr. Fruit's
name had not been mentioned
in connection with the office. Judge
James Breathitt recently declined to be
a candidate and it was not known that
the Republicans were contemplating
the nomination of a candidate against
Judge C.'H. Bush.
Mr. Fruit appeared before the com
mittee and accepted.
He is a native of this county, a son
of the lato Capt. S. T. Fruit, a federal
soldier.He-began lije as a school
teacher but wasjidmjlted to the local
bar nine years ago. He is 3lJ years
old and is married. '
Mr. Fruit says it Is" not his purpose
to make speeches over the district.
The district last year went Repub
lican, but it is hardly possible that
Mr. Fruit has been nominated with
any hope of success.

BIRTH OF NATION
The Advance Sales For Last
Night Indicated Crowd
ed House.
WONDERFUL IS PICTURE
Two More Engagements For
This Afternoon and To
night. Manager McPhcrson was more than
pleased with the crowd that saw
"The Birth of a Nation" last night, in
its first performance at the Taber
nacle. They came from far and near
and tho great picture was shown to a
delighted and enthusiastic audience.
There will be a matinee this after
noon and another night performance
tonfght at 8 o'clock. Hundreds of
seats had already been reserved for
these performances yesterday and all
indications point to big crowds through
out the engagement.
The general character of "The
Birth of a Nation" is of necessity so
ber and somber. It represents a
critical period in the history of the
States. It pictures a time that
"tried men's souls" and is not to be
approached in levity or with the view
that there is a laugh in every line.
It is not a farce; it is not a comedy, it
is simply a truthful picture of the
times it portrays, and there was little
of a comic nature about those times
and events. 'Yet there is comedy in
D. W. Griffith's filmed spectacle.
Comedy of the most delicate sort, but
comedy nevertheless.
There is the typical Southern home
where all is ..goodichecj; War's
alarms have not yet disturbed its
serenity. A Northerner is visiting
his old college chum. Youth will be
served, and in their playful wrestling
and chasing each other about the old
mansion and grounds we have pure
comedy and the best of good feeling.
No matter if within a few months they
arc to die on the field of battle, ene
mies but clasped in each others arms.
Then there is the young daughter
of the Southern home; almost a
hoyden, playful as a kitten, up to all
sorts of tricks with her brothers, sis
ter, and their cuests. Alas, later we
see her tragic end, when to save her
self from a fate worse than death,
she jumps from the high cliff. Com
edy that ends in tragedy, but comedy
just the same.
Again there is the scene in "the
quarters" where the negroes are
"showing off" for the benefit of
Northern visitors. There is the shuf
fle, buck and wing "Mississippi
Sawyer," "Turkey in the Straw,"
and other steps in which the darkeys
delighted. Later in the play they
have their serious roles.
And so throuuh it all there are bits
of the lighter shade of life to be over
cast by the somber shade later on
j inu inai is wnai manes mo uiriu

Nearly 100 Additions.
The Record says 78 additions to
the three Cadiz churches have follow
ed the Culpepper meeting. The Bap
tists got 35, the Methodists 27 and tho
Christians 10. Bethel, a county
church, got 12 and the other church
es received smaller numbers.
Joe Pugh Dying.
Col. Joe Pugh, former Covington
Ky., police chief, and one of Ken
tucky's best known democrats, lies at
the point of death at his farm on Tur
key Foot road, just isouth of Coving
ton, Ky. His illness is pronounced
diabetes.
Will Enter Ministry.
Fell,x Sanders, a young salesman in
the store Jf "Jefferson &Street, Cadiz,
joined tho Methodist church during
the recent Culpepper revival, and
left last Monday for Elkton to study
for the ministry in the Vanderbilt
Training School.
iUSING THE
STREETS
Should Pedestrians or
Joy
Riders Be ..Given
Preference?
It is not generally known that Hop
kinsville police are enforcing a rule
requiring all vehicles that stop on the
streets to stop on that side in which
they are headed, even when it is nec
essary to cross the street to the op
posite' side of that upon which is lo
cated a store to be entered. This is a
good rule and is carrying out the-well-established
highway rule requir
ing all vehicles to keep to the right.
Owcnsboro has just passed a new
ordinance prohibiting pedestrians
from crossing the streets diagonally.
They must go to the corners and cross
at right angles, even when it necessi
tates more walking and more time.
Many cities have ordinances prohibit
ing loitering on the sidewalks to an
extent that obstructs the passage of
pedestrians. All of these things arc
well enough, but the pedestrians are
not usually the ones needing the strin
gent regulations in congested streets.
There should be some steps taken to
keep unused vehicles from being
parked in the streets on busy days.
Two circuses are coming tnis month
and il they are not regulated, the ve
hicles will appropriate every point of
vantage along the route of parade,
often getting in front of the doors of
people who are entitled to use their
own frontage. Let us hope that Mayor
Bassett will start in time to give the
footmen a chance on the narrow
streets when the bit? crowd comes.
At least relegate the automobiles and
buggies to the side streets, when there
is not room for the people.
CADIZ COURT.
Euirene Wilson, who shot and kill
ed Lee Humphries, in Cadiz, last Ma',
