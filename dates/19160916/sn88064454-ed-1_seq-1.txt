Bad Roads.

The recent rains we have hadl
have caused ll all our roads to Ihe
c,,m' l,Ha. those with, ut de.e holes
will dry, Ibut will remain rough
unless s lsonil imniediate attentioni
,e gi\ten them before the rainy
season of winiter and will surel)
fwom',,zne iimpassaltle, and the. busi
ness of thie town will sffter in con
sei uence.
SD)irt roads are not as goId IanId
duralt'i as .ratvel, but with the
proper care. can he maintained in
,tdi pas.sable condition.
All oth11r sections of the country
atre building good gravel roads and
we are not even trying to keep our
dirt roads in good condition. how
can we expect to draw the people
to town to trade with us unless we
can give them as good roads as
they have going to other towns?
We have seen soime very good
roads liln feet wide and nine
inches deep. with the help of the
farmers that were built at a cost
of $1,800 per mile. We believe a
road district could be formed of
the tirst ward or a portion of the
ward, and with a tax of five mill,
raise enoulgh money to gravel all
our llail roads.
The thing is of such great im
portance for this section that we
believe it should he cnsidered
seriously by our people. The time
is ripe for action.

Negro Agents D)oing Good

the miembhers of their race especial
care is exercised to procure tmen
and( woLnan of tact as well as inte
grity and training, as their p)rob
leIs,. as a rule, are more difficult
than those of the white agent.
They meet with more diffidence
and imndifference. and to overcome
this the agents must be real leaders.
The seven iegro agents in Louisi
ana have been selected with the
foregoing conditions in mind. and
the Extension authorities are well
pleased with the results that are
being obtained by them. - Press
Bulletin.
--People always speak well of a
boy who minds his own business
and who seems to be disposed to
be somebody in time. This is a
queer world; many people are
watching us, and help often comes
when and from whom we least ex
pect. Confidence is the safe in
which men often deposit rich trea
sures and as you prove worthy so
will your reward of success be.
There is a reward in success, which
none but those who strive can en
joy. Deserve success and it will
come. -Abbevill, Progress.
