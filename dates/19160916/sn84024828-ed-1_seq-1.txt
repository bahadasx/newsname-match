AZTEC SHAH OF
TOM REED DROPS
ONTO RICH ORE
From Oatman Section Dally Miner.
The Aztec shaft of the Tom Reed
has struck rich ore. It was exposed
in cutting a station at the 500-foot
level and 20 tons of it are already
on the dump, mostly hoisted since
Tuesday. The ore averages, accord
ing to trustworthy information, $32
a ton. The shaft is 600 feet south of
the Big Jim endline and between that
property and the Telluride. There
have been various sensational rumors
of much higher values, one being that
the average value was $100 a ton.
The find being in proven territory
ordinarily it would cause no surprise,
but the opposite effect seems to have
arisen. It is the, talk of the town,
much as was the case of the Telluride
a few weeks ago. Whether or not it
is because it is the Tom Reed or not
is a study in psychology, but it is a
fact that it is one that nobody doubts
the genuineness of the strike.
Since the find was made a crosscut
has been started and the ore body
has been opened up for ten feet. It
is maintaining the same average value
with no wall yet in sight. It is one of
the most promising of recent finds in
the Oatman district.
L
WILL MAP DISTRICT
L. F. Biggs of the United States
Geological Survey arrived yesterday
from Rochester, Nevada, for the pur
pose of doing the preliminary work
for topographical and geological maps
of the Oatman district.
His part of the work consists of
establishing the points of control,
fwhich means locating the four or five
highest points, like the" Boundary
'Cone and others, measuring the exact
distance between them and getting
the elevations. This labor, with the
assistance of one man, will require
-about three weeks.
After him and with his work as a
basis the topographical work will be
undertaken by other surveyors, and
the geological map will have this as
a basis also, taking the dip of the
formations and other features into ac
count in working out the masses o:
'information that it will compile and
sketch into the form of a geological
map.
RIDENQUR EXPECTS
BETTER T
"When they learn that you are from
Oatman they begin asking questions
about the camp, asking the same
things that are asked here many times
every day," said William Ridenhour
yesterday after his return from an
extended visit to the coast.
"They want to know what you think
about times livening up this fall and
as a rule when they talk to you they
are after information. It shows that
there is a lot of interest in Oatman
and it is my opinion that we are going
to have better times."
It is not Mr. Ridenour's nature to
be subjected to fits of enthusiasm and
what he says about the camp and min
ing conditions is with deliberation.
His faith in the camp is based on the
solid rock of its past record in his own
favor, he being one of the stockhold
ers of the United Eastern, president
of the United Western, which is the
principal field for his activities, and
also a shareholder in the Arizona
Stores company.
He stated that there was nothing
new to report in the Western and that
so far as planned now there is no
change of program in sight from run
ning the north and south drifts on the
500-foot level.
'TAG DAY" FOR COUNTY
HOSPITAL BIG SUCCESS
Yesterday was "tag day" in King
man, the ladies being out in force to
collect a fund for and boost the new
idea of a county hospital that would
take in pay patients. This measure
will be on the ballot in November.
GOLD RANGE TO START
IRK IN FEW DAYS
From Oatman Section Dally Miner.!
In the course of a week or so the
Gold Range is scheduled to join the
active properties of Oatman. It is
'controlled by Los Angeles men and
the local management is to be in the
keeping of C. R. Waters, who has
been an active mine developer here for
some time and has a keen insight into'
Oatman conditions.
The Gold aRnge is located in the
vicinity of the Bluebird, and in the
direction of the Ivanhoe and Times.
Its values will be influenced greatly
by the Ollie Oatman dyke, which tra
verses the country thereabouts.
SOMETHING DOING AT
THE GOLDROAD MINE
There is something important doing
with reference to the Goldroad mine.
Not over three days ago a gang of
men was at work under the direction
of Joe Oneto, dismantling some of
the plant and tearing up track, when
a telegram came and in the middle of
the day and the midst of the work,
all came to a halt. From that it
seems that the company is not going
to quit the district, or if it is there
is something in the air to the effect
that somebody else is to take its place
and make use of the plant.
It is known for a fact that a prom
inent local operator who has more
than made good in this district, re
cently tried to negotiate a bond and
lease on the mine. He is well ac
quainted with it and knows as do hun
dreds of others that in the mine there
is uns toped ore running into the
thousands of tons. He knows further,
as was recently stated by the Daily
Miner, that in all its history the Gold
road never ran a crosscut as much
as 200 feet, and that all told in the
mine there is not that amount of
crosscutting.
He was refused the bond and lease
and told that the least money the
United States Smelting, Refining and
Mining company would consider would
be $200,000 cash. Whether that is
asked as an initial payment with
more to follow, is not stated, but it
is known at any rate that the company
thinks a lot of the property, which
has produced millions.
Hie rumor now is that the company
has accepted a cash payment in the
form of an option of $35,000 from par
ties unknown, and the dismantling is
to cease forthwith and the mill plant,
track and all equipment is to go with
the property.
INTERESTED IN GAMP
"A lot of Oatman stock is owned
in California," said Frank G. Jewett,
a broker, yesterday after returning
from a sojourn of several weeks at
Murietta Springs. "When they find
out you are from Oatman they com
mence firing inquiries at you about
certain companies and stocks, and
they have great faith in Oatman.
"I cannpt say that times are any
better there, but the people are look
ing for better times. At any rate,
they are expecting great things of
Oatman."
Mr. Jewett went to the springs on
account of a serious attack of rheu
matism following an accident to his
foot and knee. He has completely
recovered and is in normal health,
ready for the fall activity that he
says is coming.
MRS. GIDEON RESIGNS
Editor Mohave Daily Miner:
As I have never been in ac
cord with the purposes of the
Congressional Union for Wo
man Suffrage, and as that or
ganization is trying to obscure
the real purposes of the suf
frage organizations, I have con
cluded to tender my resignation
as county chairman of the suf
fragist party.
MRS. J. P. GIDEON.
Kingman, Sept. 14, 1916.
ARIZONA CDPPERFIELDS WILL
EXPLORE ITS VAST HOLDINGS
The Arizona Copperfields, Inc., is
the name of a new company that has
been organized to take over the con
trol of a new porphyry copper prop
erty, situated in the Wallapai mining
district, Mohave county, Arizona,
about 22 miles north of Kingman and
two miles from the Kingman & Chlo
ride branch of the Atchison, Topeka
& Santa Fe railroad.
The active head of the company is
William Barret Ridgely, comptroller of
the currency from 1901 to 1908 under
the administration of President Roose
velt. Mr. Ridgely is persident and'
treasurer. The vice-president is Geo,
Z. Medalie of the New York law firm
of Wasservogel & Medalie. R. W.
Gnekow is secretary.
Arizona Copperfields, Inc., is or
ganized under the laws of the state
of Delaware, with a capital stock of
$5,000,000. The par value of each
share is $1.
A statement of the plans, arrange
ments and properties follows:
The company has contracted to take
over more than 83 per cent oi uie
capital stock of the Copperfield Por
phyry Copper Mining company. This
company is the owner of six valuable
mining claims. Arizona Copperfields,
Inc., is acquiring this stock,' together
with the absolute ownership of 13 ad
ditional claims in the same mining dis
trict which are similar to the six
claims owned by the Copperfield Por
phyry Copper Mining company.
In the acquisition of this stock and
of these claims the corporation obtains
a clear title, subject only to the pay
ment of a practically nominal sum of
about $37,000.
Of this amount $20,000 has been
paid up to September 15 and a con
tract has been made by which the Jjal
ance will be paid without the expendi
ture of a dollar from the treasury of
the company.
Provision has been made whereby
the new company will receive $100,000,
which is considered more than ample
for the immediate development of this
property on a liberal scale.
For such other future development
and equipment as may be necessary
thereafter an undivided interest in 2,
000,000 shares of the capital stock has
been reserved for the benefit of the
treasury. By means of these arrange
ments there will thus be secured to
ths corporation capital apparently am
ple for the exploration and develop
ment which are necessary to place the
property on a producing basis, and
also a liberal supply of stock for thej
sole benefit of the company to meet
any contingencies that may arise in
development, production and expan
sion on a large scale.
Of the combined acreage, develop
ment to date has shown that about
16 acres is underlaid by a bed of dis
seminated porphyry ore which pre
liminary estimates show to contain
about 1.85 per cent copper. This com
pares with such porphyries as Inspira
tion, with an average of 1.63 per cent
copper; Utah, averaging 1.45; Chino,
1.70; Miami, 1.87, and Nevada Consoli
dated, 1.65 per cent Like these prop
erties when first discovered, it re
quires only additional drilling to block
out a huge tonnage of ore prior to
opening up the mine and drawing
plans for a concentrating plant to re
cover the values from the ores.
The ort itself, or rather the valua
ble mineral, is the familiar chalco-
cite encountered ir. all the big porphy
ry coppers in the southwest and else
where, and in addition there are small
quantities of native copper varying in
size from a pinhead to nuggets
weighing several pounds.
The preliminary development work
that has already been done consists of
a tunnel that has been run in about
200 feet and is in commercial ore for
most of this distance. The rock in
this tunnel assays from 3 per cent to
as high as 33 per cent in places. This
tunnel, although driven close to the
surface and skimming along what is
practically the upper side of the ore-
body, nevertheless shows copper
glance and native copper, which qccur
in cracks and crevices. The rock is of
such a texture that when it is broken
and screened it readily concentrates.
The values easily separate from the
coarse rock, so that a product of from
3 to 4 per cent copper, from 4 to 8

There is also a shaft that has at

59 feet of which is in the overburden
or leached zone, carrying small values
in copper. At a depth of 60 feet wa
ter was encountered and the values,
began to increase, and at a depth of
61 feet 6 inches assays were obtained
running from 1.5 to '3.38 per cent cop- J
per. These developments are in a line
across the deposit, showing that it
has a width of over 700 feet
In addition to th6 workings de
scribed there is a small prospect hole
about 1000 feet from the 61-foot shaft
This has been sunk in the capping or
gossan. It encountered low grade ore
at a depth of 10 feet This ore as
sayed from to 1 per cent copper.
There are still 20 feet more to be sunk
in this shaft before the water level is
reached, and it is expected that when
this point is passed the .richest sul
phide ore yet opened up on the prop
erty will be encountered.
The deposit has been shown by pre
liminary examination to be 700 feet
wide and to have a length of at least
1000 feet The ore has been proved
to have a thickness of 50 feet These
figures indicate, subject to further
checking up, 35,000,000 cubic feet of
ore, which on the basis of 13 cubic
feet to the ton, are equivalent to 2,
692,307 tons. This tonnage, on an
average assay of 1.85 per cent copper,
or 37 pounds per ton, would contain
99,615,359 pounds of copper, which at
15c per pound, the average price of
copper over a number of years, repre-ling
sents a gross value of $14,942,303,
from which, of course, must be deduct -
ed the cost of opening up the deposit,
mining and smelting charges, etc. In
ntw words, it would amjear that
there are already exposed gross values
amounting to almost three times the!
full authorized capitalization of the j
company at par value.
The proving up of ore in a property
of this kind by means of churn-drill
holes located at intervals of 200 feet,
forming squares 200 by 200, is a com
paratively simple and inexpensive
matter. Every additional square de
veloped by drill holes will mean an
other 154,000 tons of ore of a gross
value of $854,700.
Thus far it has been shown, as al
ready stated, that approximately 16
acres are underlaid by copper ore, but
all of the claims show small values in
copper, ranging from 1 per cent to 2
per cent, indicating that there has
been copper there, but that it has been
leached out, so that undoubtedly the
concentrated values will be found t at
depth.
The topography of the property is
typical of the Arizona desert, being
entirely devoid of timber. There is
enough water on the property, how
ever, to supply a concentrator of 300
tons per day capacity, and additional'
water supply may be developed by
building dams farther up in the moun
tains to impound it For nine months
in the year there is an abundance of
water tc supply any size of concen
trator desired. This water runs down
the gulch and passes close to
the j
mouth of the tunnel through which
the property is being developed.
The two tracts of ground contain
320 acres, of which 120 acres belong
to the original Copperfield Porphyry
Mining company, while 200 acres rep
resent the 13 claims acquired in addi
tion thereto. The company was or
ganized for the purpose of carrying
out a comprehensive development
program, in order to bring the prop
erty up to the productive and dividend-
paying stage.
With this object in view, President
Ridtrelv is now in Kingman. He has
already visited the property and feels
deeply impressed. In a few days the j
consulting engineer of the company j
will also arrive.
The object of the visit is to lay out
a systematic campaign of development I
by chum-drilling.
As a result of the advances in por-
phyry mining and the metallurgy ofing the company's property, pushing

district On the Surprise Claim there
'is an immense dyke from 40 to 60
feet wide from which pannings of free
gold are obtained across nearly the
whole width. An ore shoot near the
hanging wall of this dyke yields sur

At that point a shaft was started
on the ore. This shaft will probably
be continued to a depth of 300 feet

ON STORE BUILDING
IFrom Friday's Dally Miner
Work on the Lovin and Withers'
company's building will begin in the
near future. Bids of contractors will
be opened next Monday.
The new building will be one of the
handsomest store structures in north
ern Arizona. It will be the best
lighted store buildings in the state
without doubt as the entire front and
sides will be nearly all of glass, with
pillars between the huge windows.
The structure will be Duilt of terra
cotta blocks, 8x8x12 inches in dimen
sions a class of construction that is
considered as near fireproof as is
possible. It will cover an area iront-

CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATION
An examination for clerk will be
held at the Kingman postoffice on
October 31. The age limit is from
18 to 45 years. Married women will
not be admitted to the examination.
Women who have been divorced and
are earning their own living do not
come under the purview of this prohi
bition. Applicants must be physcially
sound. Male applicants must not be
less than 5 feet, 4 inches in height

PARK PROPERTY IN
UNION PASS SOLD
TO SEATTLE CROWD
From Saturday'! Daily Hinerl
J. E. Park, owner of property ad
joining the old Expansion mine in the
Union Pass section, was a Kingman
visitor yesterday. He reports that he
has been developing four claims and
so well have they proven up that he
has optioned them to Seattle, Wash
ington, people for a considerable sum,
having already received a payment
One of the claims has a vein 60
feet wide that gives milling values
across a large part of the mass.
There is another but smaller vein that
gives assays up to $200 per ton.
The new company taking over the
property is headed by C. L. Gleason,
president of the American Savings
Bank of Seattle. He is expected to
arrive here within two weeks to look
into conditions and arrange for the
installation of machinery.
Adjoining Park ground is the prop
erty of O'Brien and Kobeck, known
as the Last Day and Big Strike. This
property is to have a plant of ma
chinery within the next two weeks.
About $50,000 worth of ore is now
blocked out in the two claims.
DEMAND FOR LOTS
STEADILY GROWING
IFrom Saturday'! Daily Miner
C. M. Leonard, manager of the
Kingman Realty Syndicate, reports
numerous sales of lots in the several
tracts handled by that concern.
Owing to the scarcity of houses to
rent many persons are buying lots
and building small homes. It is
noticeable that the day of the shack
and tent is passing and more sub
stantial homes are taking their place.
J. C. Burke, who has built many
"bungalows in Los- Angeles, Long
Beach and Douglas and who recently
arrived in Kingman, has purchased a
large lot in the Kingman Terrace
Addition, at South Front and Eighth
Streets and is building four bunga
lows. Mr. Leonard looks for a growing
demand for building lots, with pro
bably a stiffening of prices, when the
expected fall influx of people begins.
Recent sales as reported by Mr.
Leonard follow:
Lots 16 & 17, block 1, Richards

REPORT OF STRIKE IN
OATMAN-BELLE DENIED
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner.)
There was the usual excitement on
the streets of Oatman Thursday, due
to a report of a rich strike, in the
Oatman-Belle. Everybody heard it,
talked 'about it and expressed opinions
pro and con, the same as in the case
of various recent happenings of the
sort
' The Daily Miner correspondent and
a couple of friends went out to the
property, which is about a mile beyond
the Times, down the gulch to the
northwest, and not finding Lester M.
Dull, president of the company, there,
were informed by employes that there
was no truth in it, except that a small
stringer had been cut in the shaft at
85 feet On the way back Mr. Dull
was met and he made like statements
and said he had been in town where
all sorts of ill-founded reports were
in circulation. He said it was all
started by one man who came to town
and was a little inclined to get enthusiastic.
