ELY BACKS SO.ÍCKT IICKEI
Sania Fe, September 14. There is
no unworthy man to whose narao
scandal attaohea presented on lb
Democratic ticket.
With this forceful declaration ñ.
C. Ely, for the last two years Rep
ublican state chairman, sums up
the difference between the Demo
cratic and Hepublican state ticket
this year.
Mr. Ely's dclaralion is contained
n an open letter to the editor of the
Cimarron News-Citizen, answering
an inquiry as to his present political
attitud.. Sick of the corruptness of
his own party, and unable to stom
ach Hubbel and IHirsum, the former
Republican chairman comes out
squarely for Democratc success in
New Mexico.
In his letter he says
"The state ticket nominated by my
ow n party is largely 'made up of
men who in the past have not been
bound to platform pledges and
w hose records are such as to breed
lou'it rather than confidence in their
fidelity to (heir public duties. The
independent voter cannot safely
I place his faith in men who persist
ently insist that the people forget
and in the other equally dangerous
precept the people? To hell with
the people! We run the state.
I "The ticket offered by the Demo
;eratie and Independent conventions
is as a whole made up of much
i better men with cleaner records ev-
ideiicing a consistent purpose to ac
jcomplish the things se( forth in their
(platforms. I In re i.. i... unworthy
i man to whose names scandal at-
i taehes presented.
! "I can conceive of no issue now
I before the American people as a
I whole of ho deminating a character
as will juslify any self-respecting
I depuhlicitn or Independent 'in Riv
ing his support lo Frank Hubbell as
against, A. A. Jones.
"I know of 4io single trait o char
acter or line of public conduct in
I w hich Mr. Hursum is the superior
I to Frank Hubbell, and I believe that
no greater misfortune could befall
lour slate than to elect as its gov
j -'i-i o ir a man with such a record
I and with such a low standard of
i political morals as are professed by
Mr l.iirsiiin.
