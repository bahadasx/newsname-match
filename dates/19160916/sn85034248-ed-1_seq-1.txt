"The Primal Lure."
William S. Hart, admittedly Am
erica's premier interpreter of rugged
frontier types, has the leading role in
"The I'rimal Lure," which will be
seen at the Gem Theatre today.
"The Primal Lure" is an absorbing
drama of 6il'e in the great Canadian
northwest. It recites the stirring ro
mance of Angus McConn*el, a young
Scotch-Canadian factor, and Lois Le
Moyne, daughter of a French settler
at the post. It is replete with thrill
ing encounters with the Blackfeet In
dians, and ueems with a love interest
rivaled in its appeal only by the pic
turesque beauty of the story's back
ground.
Hart has the role of McConnell and
he has invested it with rare power.
A strong cast appears in his support.
"Susan Rocks the Boat."
The Sunday offering at the Gem
will be "Susan Rocks the Boat," an
interesting Triangle play with Doro
thy Gish and Owen Moore in the lead
ing roles.
Susan Johnstone is a girl with an
immense fortune and absolutely no
responsibility. She finally comes to
the conclusion that living life with
nothing worth while to do is a brain
less sort of existence, so she rocks
the family boa by getting out and
trying to do settlement work.
She has come to this conclusion by
reading the life of Joan of Are, and
seeing herself in the character of the
Maid of Orleans. As Joan give her
life to emancipation of the poor, so
shall Susan.
So Susan goes to her friend Thorn
ton, the eminent criminal lawyer, and
persuades him to take her down into
t .he Slums, where she founds and op
erates the "Jeanne d'Arc" Mission.
The building is leased from Cardigan,
keeper of a dive over the way, and
he has his sensual eyes on the pretty
little society belle, and wonders how
he can get her' in his arms.
Susan has also made the acquaint
ance of Larry O'Neil, son of the late
political boss of the ward. Larry is
utterly out of sympathy with any in
terference wit.. the way of living in
the neighborhood, and is constrained
to tell Susan what he thinks and the
inhabitants of the ward that they are
to keep away from a mission operated
with money wrung from them by Su
can's ancestors. Of course, Susan re
sents his attitude. So there springs
up a sort of antagonistic regard be
tween Susan and Larry.
Time comes when Cardigan gets
her in a room over his dive, she be
lieving that he is going to convert the
,,irn e into an ice-cream parlor, and
attacks her. Word of her danger
reaches Larry, and all his fighting
blood comes to the surface and he
makes his way to her rescue. There
is a glorious scrap in succeeding
scenes, and a triumphant finish.
"Paying the Price."
(;ail Kane, who was last seen here
in "The Labyrinth," will make her
secondtl appearance on the screen in
the vivid naval play, -'Paying the
Price," which comes to the Gem Tues
day.
The United States government co
operated with William A. Brady in
the filming of this picture, and allow
ed the entire World Film company of
players to take scenes aboard the
United States torpedo boat destroye:
"Wadsworth," No. 60, under the
guidance of Captain Taussig. Sev
eral torpedoes were fired and two
were exploded, each costing over
$4500.
The old Bronx ferryboat, for many
years a sight of interest to New York
,isito' , was used a5 the derelict
whic-l was torpedoed to provide a
realistic atmorphere for this play.
Gladden J~imes, June Elvidge and
Robert Cummings are three other top
notchers in the cast of "Paying the
'Price," which is one of the most noted
of the recent "Brady-Made" World
pictures.
"His Brother's Wife."
When "'Iis Brother's Wife" is
shownv at the Gem next Wednesday,
local picture fans will not only see
Carlyle llackwell, the "prince of
popularity." but will also see opposite
him the most charming leading lady
who has ever co-starred with Mr.
ltlackwell. She is Ethel Clayton, who
was recently added to the World Film
forces after starring for several
years in Lubin features. Among the
more important of the many pro
ductions in which she has appeared
:are "[l'he Lion and the Mouse," "The
Gamnblers" "The House Next Door,"
"The Fortune Hunter," ''The Wolf,"
a:nd "The (Great Divide." Besides the
two stars, no less than six other play
ers of prominence take part in "His
Blrother's Wife." The picture is ad
mirably suited to both Mr. Blackwell
and Miss Clayton. and is expected to
prove one of the most successful pro
ductions in which these versatile and
popular stars have yet appeared.
"The Crucial Test."
Kitty Gordon, the statuesque -En
glish beauty who made her film debut
in the screen version of the noted
novel, "As in a Looking Glass," will
be seen at the Gem Thursday in a
play ideally suited to her talents,
"The Crucial Test." Six years ago
Miss Gordon came to America to play
the leading role with Sam. Bernard in
the musical farce, "He Came from
Milwaukee." Her hit was instan
taneous. Critics and the public
alike began to rave over this British
beauty's marvelous figure, face and
vocal talent.
In "The Crucial Test" Miss Gordon.
gives another demonstration of her
wonderful dramatic ability. She is
gorgeously gowned, as usual. The
story of the play deals with Russian
nihilists, whose revolutionary propa
gandas are frequently promulgated
by women.
One such woman, the strange and
beautiful Thanya, about whom an
air of great mystery revolves, meets
Karl Holden, a wealthy American ar
tist. It is a case of love at first sight
on the part of both.
Falling in love with a beautiful wo
man, anywhere on earth, is an easy
matter, but in Russia it sometimes
becomes a very dangerous experienc9,
that is, if the Grand Duke happens to
have chosen the same fair damsel to
be his sweetheart. But to a womn i
like Thanya, the perils of love hold
no terror. Through a series of ex
citing experiences ending in a mad I
race through the wilds of Russia, to
escape a pack of hungry wolves,
Thanya arrives at last in beautiful
Paris, and-but would you enjoy so
novel a courtship? Better find out.
Anyhow, all the world loves a lov
er and you will love Thanya in "The
Crucial Test."
"The Market of Vain Desire."
Marriage to obtain a title; marri
age that is mere bargain and sale;
marriage without love, in which a girl
gives herself to a man unworthy of
her affection, merely t gratify selfish
ambition and pride-what subject has
been brought more prominently and
painfully before the American pubhc,
in the last few years?
The list of American girls of wealth
who have sold themselves, or have
been sold by scheming mothers, to
foreign noblemen, and who have re
pented bitterly, is a long and notori
ous one. A girl doomed to just such
a fate, and saved only through the
daring intervention of a fearless man,
is a character in the Triangle drama,
"The Market -of Vain Desire," in
which H. B. Warner will be seen at
the Gem Saturday, Sept. 23.
Helen Badgley's mother wants her
to marry Count Bernard d' Mon
taigne. The latter is a worthless
specimen of humanity, with nothing
save his title to recommend him to
anyone's notice. He wants a slice of
the Badgley millions, and to get the
beautiful young girl along with them
is a prospect most pleasing to him.
Helen's father is dominated by his
wife. The girl herself has seen so
little of genuine affection in the set
in which she moves that she doubts
whether there is any such thing, and
wearily accedes to her mother's plan.
But John Armstrong, a young
clergyman who has come from a coun
try pastorate to the city church at
tended by the Badgleys, does not like
the prospect at all. In the first place,
he sees the sordidness and wickedness
of the marriage; in the second place,
he is in love with the girl himself.
Asked by Badgley to announce the
engagement of Helen, he instead
preaches a vitriolic sermon denounc
ing the very sort of marriage which
the girl contemplates.
A terrific sensation in the church
follows. The girl, shocked into a
realization of her folly, breaks the
engagement. The trustees, calling
later on the young preacher to ask
his resignation, find him laid low by a
whack on the head from the infuriat
ed "nobleman's" loaded cane. And
the rest of the story is perhaps not
so hard to imagine.
Next Week's Program at the Grand.
Sunday - Mary MacLaren iu
"Shoes."
Monday-Mary Pickford in "The
Eternal Grind."
Tuesday - Hobart Bosworth in
"The Target."
Wednesday-Cleo Ridg'ley and
Wallace Reid in "The Love Mask.

Friday-Dorothy Kelly and Harry

Francis Ford in "Peg o' the Ring,"

"Shoes."
"Shoes," the extraordinary Blue
bird feature in which Mary MacLarerL
will be seen at the Grand Sunday, de
picts with gripping intensity three
vital weeks in the life of a shop girl
-the half-slave, under-paid pawn of
commerce. At home her mother
takes in washing to support two
smaller children and a lazy, good for
nothing, novel reading, "can rushing"
father; a male too lazy to even look
for work, in the mortal dread that he
might find it. For every dollar the
shop-girl and her mother can earn
there is pressing need-the rent is to
be paid, the butcher and baker de
mand cash, and father simply must
have money for tobacco and beer'
What matters if the shop-girl's
shoes are worn to tatters, that paste
board soles are required to keep her
feet from picking up splinters from
the rough floor behind the counter
where she stargds? There is need for
every penny at home; and so, after
three weeks of unfulfilled promises
that she may take $3 from the un
opened pay-envelope she lays each
Saturday night in her mother's lap
and buy a pair of shoes-the girl
gets them.
When she comes home with the
shoes on her feet her mother follows
the downcast eyes of her oldest child
to where their steady gaze falls piti
fully upon the new shoes-and then
the girl throws herself in her mother's
lap. The tears of these two stricken
women mingle in a flood of under
standing and unspoken forgiveness
and the sins of the child are washed
away.
"The Ete aI Grind."
"The Eternal Grind," a five-part
subject featuring Mary Pickford, is
announced as the Grand Theatre of
fering for Monday. It is a story of
the tenements-of toil and struggle
and temptation on the one side, of
avarice and worse on the other. The
characters and the situations have
been-drawn without exaggeration.
1iss Pickford has the role of Mary,
one of three sisters, all employed in a
sweatshop, which is reproduced on no
small scale. Mary follows the
straight path. She tries, and for a
time fails, to keep Jane from going
contrary to it, and also fights to keep
rove Amy, who has fallen a victim to
long hours and lack of ventilation.
Miss Pickford has a part in which she
perfectly fits.
There is a lighter phase to this
story of grind. *That is the love of
Mary and Owen Wharton, the latter.
of whom, a settlement worker, in dis
agreement with his grasping father,
secures work in the shop where Mary
is employed. Ernest Wharton, the
elder brother, who leads Jane astray,
is let eventually to see the light
through the persuasion of the revol
ver Mary has taken from the hand of
Jane, thereby precipitating a marri
age and preventing a murder. This
is one of the sterner situations; an
other is the colloquy between Mary
and the elder Wharton, who when he
pleads with the young woman to come
to his home and save the life of his
son, is met with a refusal, justified
by Wharton's previous disregard of
Mary's plea to help her invalid sister.
The employerpromises a new factory
and higher ages and Mary goes to
her lover's side.
"The Love Mask.'"
Cleo Ridgely and Wallace Reid ap
pear together as co-stars in a new
production by the Lasky Feature Play
Company, "The Love Mask," a grip
ping western drama which comes to
the Grand Wednesday. Miss Ridgely
hqs -been bowing b.fob7d phbotollay
lovers .for several y~eaIe Mr: Reid's
most notable engagement before he
became a Lasky star was in support
of Geraldine Farrar in the Lasky pro
duction of "Carmen."
The story of "The Love Mask" has
to do with the adventures of a young
woman who on the death of her par
ents through the mad rush for Cali
fornia gold in 1849, was forced to
seek a claim and eke out her own ex
istence by ltnning gold. How she
strikes a mother lode, only to have it
taken away from her; how she dis-.
guises herself as "Silver Spurs," a
notorious bandit; how the sheriff, in
love with her, is torn betwixt con
flicting emotions, and how it is all
finally straightened out, is told in one
of the most novel stories the Lasky
company has ever offered to the pub
lic.
"The Heart of a Child."
"The Heart of a Child," which will
be seen at the Grand Thursday, is a
five-reel adaptation of Frank Dan
by's celebrated novel. It pictures the
rise of a girl from the slums of Lon
don. She becomes a famous singer
and finally wins the love of a titled
man. The intimate pictures of En
glish life are novel and pleasing, and
the same can be said of the scenes
from the slums and the cafes and mu
sic halls
Edna Flugarth is seen at her best
in the part of "Sally Snape." She
gets the sympathy of the observer
from the first, and particularly when
on the night of her triumph, after
leaving her at the door of the flat he
had furnished for her, Gilbert enters
with a second latch key, of whose ex
istence Sally is unaware. He comes
to take his reward, but again the
phild heart conquers; he is repulsed
and leaves contrite, throwing away
the key into the road. The next
morning he asks Sally to be his wife,
which causes her to face the greatest
ordeal of her life. The story in
creases steadily in interest and comes
to a very please close. The cast is
an Eng~sh one and well balanced.
"The Law Decides."
Moving picture productions of the
quality of "The Law Decides," which
is booked for presentation at the
Grand next Friday, are hard to find.
Both writer and director are to be
complimented on the wonderfully ef
fective manner in which the psycho
logical developments have been made.
They take us to the innermost recess
es of the homes and hearts of the
characters of the play, and do so in
the most delicate manner; revealing
every phase in the lives of individu
als, and enabling us to read their
very thoughts.
The cast chosen to interpret this
domestic drama are Donald Hall
Dorothy Kelly, Louise Beaudet, Harry
Morey, Bobby Connelly, Adele Kelly
and Bonnie Taylor. Louise Beaudet
as Mrs. Wharton, who with her
daughter Beatrice occupies a portion
of the home of her step-son who lives
with his pretty wife and little boy in
the other half of the house, does a
marvelous piece of work. She it is
who stirs the cauldron of misery
which finally reacts against herself
To her is due the separation of mat
and wife, the suicide of the man whc
became her tool with a promise of in
dividual benefit, the wrecking of her
own daughter's happiness, and th
final overthrowing of her own hopes
for the achievement of a selfish de
sire.
LOWLY LEGUME NOW LORDLY.
Plebeain Beans Command Aristocrat
ic Price, Hortense Finds.
By C. G. STITH in New Orleans Item.
"What's yours?" asked Hortense,
the waitress, as she placed a glass of
water in front of a young man. He
yawned a trifle and complained of a
jaded appetite.
"I don't know what I want. What
you got?"
"How aboutia nice plate of beans?"
"Young woman, don't mention
beans to me. I wouldn't eat beans
if"-Hortense placed -her hands on
her hips and smiled a smile in which
pity and sarcasm were equal ingre
dients.
"So I shall bean you no beans, shall
I? Well, do you know that the price
of beans, whqih you have scorned,
has gone up imore relatively in the
last three week than champagne has
risen since the European war started?
Of course you don't know it. You
don't know whether pate de foi gras
is a beverage or an insect! You don't
know whether- caviare is a cosmetic
or a part of an-automobile."
"But"- -
"Listen to 'ie, my good friend,
I've got time o talk. This is an off
hour and I night as well put it to
good use by instructing the unen
lightened. To you, a bean is a bean
-don't interrupt me. Have you ever
been told that a bean consists of
water, protein, nitrogen, free extract,
ether exract, and ash, and that its
food value perpound is 1605 calories?
You don't need to answer.
"If I had $10,000 this bright sum
mer morning," continued our heroine,
"I'd invest it in the same beans at
which you turn up your retrousse
nos~. They're going up, up. Bel
gium, Russia, Great Britain, even
Canada, Italy and Greece have taken
all of the United States' surplus sup
ply. Last year's crop was far below
the average and right now Michigan
and New York are short."
"So beans grow?" ventured the
customer, as l~ figtred if he could
afford a 15-cent stew which flaunted
itself at him from the one-sheet bill
of fare. "I thought they made 'em
at Battle Creek."
"You're taxiig my patience," re
sponded Hortense. "But I shall per
severe with yout. The bean is a plant
of the natural order leguminosa or le
gumes"
"Does the pork grow with them?"
"Say, you canl be polite even if you
are not learned. I assume you have
never realized that you have eaten
ceratonia siliqua and sesquipedalis.
Well, you have. Those are the scien
tists' names f Q beans.
"How w all of this deep
stuff rSais se instead of
spending , ndial hours at
the Bung O' e places, I sit up
and perutse own set of books
in 49 volumes or which I am paying
$3 a month, rain or shine.
"Some women devote a winter to
acquiring knowledge of Ibsen or Gals
worthy. This w:inter I went in for
beans. You don't know it, but it's a
fact that beans are the best substi
tute extant for meat. They are a nu
tritious food, rich in starch and in the
proteid, legumen. If the skins are re
moved they are easier of digestion
and not so likely to cause flatulence.
"But let's look- at the financial side
of the question. On July 1 beans
were quoted in the New Orleans mar
ket at 5 cents a pound. Three days
later they had gained a quarter of a
cent; two days more they gained a
half-cent. Two weeks later we find
them at 6 1-2 cents, and now this
morning they are 7. If they keep up
the same pace for the next year they
will be something like $2 a pound by
the next Fourth of July. Now, what
are you going to have?"
"Gimme a plate of beans."

ED-TIME STORIES ,n
By Master Bernard Lemann
Grandpa's Story.
Grandpa sat in his big arm chair
watching the glowing fire, when in
skipped five happy children and gath
ered about him.
"Tell us a story," they all said.
"Alright," he replied and then be
gan: Once upon a timhe there lived
a girl who was very poor. Her name I
was. Ella. Ella was blind and could i
not see the bi white clouds float I
across the sky as if they were boats, I
nor could she see the green meadow.
Ella lived in a cottage that was not
so far from a great composer's home
and she would often sit upon his door
step for hours and listen to him play,
She wished that she could be a great
composer too.
One day when she had done all her i
work, Ella went to the composer's
house and sat upon the doorstep as I
usual. She was listening to the beau
tiful notes he played. Sometimes
they were sweet and soft and other
times they were loud. Ella began to
sing. She unlocked her lips that <
were clasped together and out float
ed mellow notes into the air. Then
she began to sing sweeter and more
beautiful ehan ever. The air was
filled with glorious music. All the
neighbors stopped to listen.
But at last the composer stopped
playing and Ella stopped singing.
He walked to the door az4) opened it:
"Was that you singing?" he said.
"Yes,"ereplied Ella, politely.
"Can you play also?" asked the
composer.
"I never have, but maybe I can if
I try," she answered.
"Well come in and try," he said.
Ella felt her way to the piano and
sat upon the stool. She began to
play what she heard the composer
play.
Ella had never played before but
it was a gift from God that she could
play without seeing the keys of the
piano. After this she spent one hour
every 4ay with the composer.
Any ow Ella is an opera singer
and sings the opera that the com
poser composett
"Tell us another," said the five
happy children.
"Alright," said Grandpa, and he be
gan another:
Once upon a time when the world
was new-Grandpa's voice grew
fainter and fainter until he stopped
altogether.
"Sh-h-h-h-h," wispered five happy
children and they tip-toed out the
parlor, leaving Grandpa to dream a
dream of his boyhood days.

WATER SUPPLY- TESTED.
State Health Board Takes Important
Step in People's Interest.
During the ip of the labora
of Health,,.. in April 1048
samples of wt from every quarter
of the state were collected and sub
jectel to a bacteriological test.
The process of discovering the
quality of the water supply through
out the state, inaugurated by Dr.
Dowling, is the first of the kind to
be started in this country, though
Kentucky some time ago made an in
vestigation of the same nature, but
by no means as far-reaching. The
laboratory car runs to every quarter
of the state and when stops are made
an automobile is unloaded and pro
ceeds through the country, collecting
samples of water from streams, wells
and sources of communal supply.
The sampling of the water from a
well, at first glance, affects only the
residents of the farmstead, but the
source of the supply on the neigh
boring farms is probably the same,
and if the water be good there is a
probability that the water from the
other wells in the neighborhood is al
so good, unless there is immediate
contamination. If the supply proves
to be bad, the neighboring farmers
are at once put on their guard and
can send in a sample from their wells
for analysis.
The analysis made is bacteriologi
cal only, every form of organic life
being examined by careful test. The
result has not yet been announced,
but the compilation is in progress
and will soon be published by the
state board. Some of the communal
sources of supply have been found to
be impure, and the board has notified
the local authorities and directed the
proper method of purification.
There have been cases decided in
the north in which the municipal gov
ernment has been held reupnsible for
the effects of impure water, and in
some cases criminal prosecutions have
been successfully launched against the
municipal officials. Before the pres
ent investigation is concluded ex
aminations will have been made of
from ten to thirty samples from every
parish of the state, and a good idea
will be had of the water supply of
every family in Louisiana. Where
the water is found not to be potable
the supply will be condemned by the
state board and notices will be posted
warning the public against drinking,
l and if the water is consumed the per
son drinking it will do so at his own
I risk and with open eyes.-Times

Carriere s Three-Time Murderer.
Hilaire Carriere, the desperado
who shot and killed Sheriff Marion L.
Swords of St. Landry parish, con
fesses to having killed three men
within a year, and while expressing
regret for having to shoot Sheriff
Swords, of whose identity he claims
to have been at the time ignorant,
he also regrets not having killed in
stead of merely wounding the two
negroes who were with Sheriff Swords
and Deputy Chacere when the fight in
the Mallet woods took place.
The rewards offered for the cap
ture of Carriere aggregate $1700, and
it is proposed to pay $500 of this sum
to the man who gave information as
to the movements and whereabouts of
the fugitive, the balance to be divided
among the six members of Sheriff
Reid's posse. The informer's name
is not to be divulged, but he is said to
be one of Carriere's kinsmen.
The greatest menace to public
health is the fly, Kill it.
As I Heard It.
A certain man named "Little Joe,"
Who goes and comes and comes and
go,
Did say unto Sully Ambeau,
"I'm preside it must be so."
"Of what, pr'tell?'' did Sully say
To "Little Joe," so light and gay,
"For I don't know. I cannot play
A hand before I see my way."
There is a man named Armitage,
Who now and then is on the stage,
Whose hand is rather hard to gauge.
And "President" was on his page.
"Good friends," quoth he, "I've serv
ed you long,
To turn me down would be quite
wrong,
The office doth to me belong,
For me they cry-the entire throng."
One day at Darrow all clans met,
And each one fought for his own pet,
Swore and declared the job he'd get.
And all did fuss and all did sweat.
The writer dwells far, far away:
Of his own knowledge cannot say
Exactly what took place that day,
And writes herein from pure hearsay.
Says "Little Joe," "'Twas promised
me
Si long ago. 1 cannot see
Why all of us should not agree,
And friends of mine, supporters be."
"I've made the fight for sixteen years,
Through fields c. fire and lakes of
tears,
Through bitterest foe's, laughs and
jeers,
Fr more jurors and officeers."
The fight for "T Joe" long did rage,
But all his points :killed Armitage,
Who wouldn't down-and like a blaze
Swept all before him off the stage.
At Donaldson, the story goes,
"T Joe" said, "I'll join the foes,"
And scared 'em up, as everyone
knows,
For think! The feuds, the sores, the
sores!
The throng now turns to "Little Joe"
Who's a power, all of us know.
And to the courthouse all doth go,
And as one man. they cry "T Joe."
Injunctions still a ,live and thrive,
And withhold bees from every hive,
They dearwith dead and things alive,
And all the fittest doth survive.
Says Mister Pugh, "This will not do,
An injunction I must get,
For 'Little Joe' steps on my toe.
He will do it then. You bet."
Judge Howell said, (and T Joe fled),
"An injunction you shall have."
The hopeful words that I last heard,
"I will come again," T Joe said.
"OLD TIMER."
Rough on Rats.
The population of New Orleans has
been greatly reduced by the plague
prevention work of the United States
public health service-the rat popula
tion, we mean. Up to Aug. 19, 810,
133 rodents had been captured by
the health corps' force of trappers,
and the number increases at the rate
of about 7500 a week. Of 376,295
rats examined at the laboratory 320
were found to be infected with the
germ of the bubonic plague, the la
test specimen having been captured
Aug. 1, 1916. There has been no hu
man plague case in New Orleans
since Sept. 8, 1915. The health ser
vice campaign is rough on rats, but
mighty good for the rest of the city's
population.
Tell 'em you saw it in The Chief.
