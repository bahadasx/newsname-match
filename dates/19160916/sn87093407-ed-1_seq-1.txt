CHILDISH LAUGHTER GREETS STAR REPORTER WHEH FELLOW CLOWNS WHACK HIM
Once, when I was a nine-year old kid, I read a story
about Toby Tyler, who one night scrambled up into the
neat of a circus wagon, made friends with the old driver,
and rode away.
Toby carried water for elephants a while.
Then, late one afternoon, the bareback rider buckled
a big leather belt around his little stomach, attached it to
the revolving crane in the center ring and gave Toby his
first bareback le-son.
But, next day, with the belt removed, Toby fell from
the back of the big white horse, and lay very still in the
»a wdttst. A doctor was summoned.
'l hc circus folk, who had adopted him, waited for the
VlCT—three years of a 14-
year sentence for robbery
in San Quentin peniten
tiary. "Artie" Baker is
her real name.
Prison authorities must
have known her sex. So
must the federaf officers
who arrested her and ob
tained her conviction.
She is there today in the
garb of a man, and until
this story carried her ap
peal to the world, her se
cret had been locked within
the prison's grim, gray
walls.
For three years "Art"
Raker lived among hun
dreds of rough men, who,
one by one, learned her se
cret.
She was jostled and jibed
and insulted until an ap
peal to the prison doctor
brought her a separate cell
