found it' extending further and

now, in this vicinity it has cross

THE CLOSE OF CONGRESS.
The most remarkable session
of the congress of the United
States hat has ever been held
came to an end yesterday, Sept
ember 8th.
Nevejr before, in the entire
history of the country, has there
been a session comparable to
this one in the amount of really
constructive legislation enacted,
legislation that, for good or ill,
is bound to have adecided and
very real effect on the business
and social conditions obtaining
throughout the nation.
Some of the anti administra
tion forces would have it that
the achievements of President
Wilson and his party are wholly
evil and that the country is go
ing to the dogs with horrific
speed. The voters know other
wise and will demonstrate that
fact to the entire satisfaction,
although not to the pleasure, of
Candidate Hughes and his horde
of calamity howlers.
Through a world crisis un
paralleled in the history of civil
ization, the United States has
been guided by the genius of her
mighty president, whose firm
hand upon the helm of the ship
of the state has enabled the
storm tossed bark to whether
every gale, to avoid every
hidden reef and to sail trium
phantly into the harbor of peace
and prosperity.
Nor have domestic storms been
wanting to try the nerve of the
commander. Iu the face of the
most violent opposition, opposi
tion often as unpa triotic as it was
violent, he has preserved inter
nal peace, kept clear of the
troubles in Mexico, settled the
threatened catastrophe of a gen
eral railroad strike, completely
reformed the currency system
and done what the republicans
have promised to do for twenty
years enacted a real child labor
law.
For the benefit of the farmers
he has passed the Federal Farm
Loan bill which will enable the
owner of a piece of land to
secure such moneys as he may
require at the same rates and on
the same conditions as the mer
chant or manufacturer may bor
row from his bank.
To labor, he has given assur
ance that the eight hour day
will be recognized as the funda
mental law of the land, so far as
lies within the powers of the
federal government to make it
such and, by his impartial handl
ing of the railroad dipute, he
has bound to himself as with
links of steel, the great body of
wage earners who recognize in
him, not an agitator who is try
ing to exploit them, but a true
friend. Gazette.
MOUNTAIN TRAVEL.
The Rules to Insure Satety for Auto
Drivers.
First, drive slowly. Mountain
roads are not valley boulevards.
Second, be sure you have a
good horn and use it. There are
many places where an oncoming
car is hidden in trees or around
turns. A warning may save
one or the other from backing to
a passing place and more itn
portant, it prevents accidents.
Third, keep to the right of the
turn.
Fourth, give the other fellow
a little the best of every situa
tion that arises. If a car is ap
proaching, don't try to beat him
to a passing place, but wait.
Fifth, if a car capable of climb
ing faster than you overtakes
you on a grade, give him the
road. Expect and demand the
same courtesy from the one
slower than you. Many moun
tain accidents results from dis
regard of this rule.
Sixth, don't get exacted. The
mountain roidsof Yavapai coun
ty are not narrow enough to be
dangerous. The altitude, and
the steep descent at the side of
the road mean slower driving
that's all. Hundreds of automo
biles are driven with safety over
these roads every week.
Seventh, be sure your car is
in good condition. Be sure that
brakes are adjusted evenly, and
the lining good.
Eighth, never leave the car
standing with only the brakes to
hold it. Shut off the power and
mesh the low gear. This is
more effective than the brake.
Ninth, use the motor as a
brake in descending grades.
Mesh the gears in' low, off
power. This cools the motor,
saves the brakes and prevents
the driver from losing control of
the car. Many mountain accid
ents are the result of burned out
brakes.
Tenth, in driving mountain
grades, stick to your knitting.
Don't be admiring the beautiful
scenery. If you want to do that
hire a driver.
Eleventh, equip your car with
good dimmers for night driving.
The danger of undimmed head
lights is very great in mountain
driving. Yavapai.
HAYDEN'S GOOD WORK.
In support of his bill opening
Indian reservation lands to pro
specting and mineral develop
ment, Congressman Carl Hayden
said in the house of represent
atives, on Sept. 4:
"I will state to the gentleman
from Wisconsin that as introduc
ed this bill applied to the state
of Arizona only, and it was at
the suggestion of the depart
ment of the interior that the
change was made making it ap
ply to all the western states.
As far as I am concerned, my
chief interest is to see the bill
apply to Arizona, because I know
the conditions in my state, and
I am satified that this bill is
workable there.
"No one who is at all familiar
with the facts doubts that valu
able deposits of gold, silver,
copper and other metaliferous
minerals are to be found in the
various Indian reservations in
Arizona and the other western
states. The existence of many
of such deposits has been known
for many years, but in the ab
sence of suitable legislation
these resources have remained
undeveloped. Without either the
skill or the capital that is re
quired to conduct successful min
ing operations, it has been im
possible for the Indians to obtain
any benefit from the minerals
that lie unused in their lands. I
have therefore introduced this
bill in the hope that it will pro
vide a workable plan whereby
the mining industry, particular
ly of my own state, will be pro
moted for the benefit of the In
dians and the white people alike.
"You will note that this act
applies only to Indian lands that
have been heretofore withdrawn
from entry under the mining
laws, so that it will in no way
interfer with mining on any In
dian reser vation where the same
is now authorized by existing
law. This is likewise true of
reservations where the title to
the mineral in the lands has not
passed to the Indians, as in the
case of the Papago reservation
in Arizona. When that reserva
tion was created the president
wisely determined that the Pa
pagos had acquired no right to
the minerals in thrjir country,
because they have made no at
tempt to mine them, and in the
executive order establishing the
Papago reservation it is specific
ally stated that the mineral
lands within the reservation are
to remain open to entry under
the mining laws. It would have
been much better if such a pro
vision had been included in the
executive orders by which the
other reservations were created;
but this was not done, so that
the minerals have been given to
the Indians, and there is now no
other Way to proceed except to
recognize their ownership.
"I am well aware that there
are many members of the house
who object to the adoption of a
leasing system, and I am in ac
cord with them in opposing- the
payment of royalties for the
privilige of mining for metalifer
ous minerals on the public do
main. We must not forget,bow
ever, that the lands which may
be leased under the provisions
of this bill are the tribal prop
erty of the Indians and that it
has not been the policy of the
government to permit mining on
Indian reservations under the
general mining laws except in
the case of the Papago reserva
tion, to which I have just referr
ed. Since the lands in all of
the other reservations have been
set aside for the exclusive use
and benefit of the Indians we
must recognize that they are en
titled to receive the same in
come from their property as any
other private proprietor.
"So far as the Indians are con
cerned now is the opportune
time to pass this bill. The pre
sent high prices that are re
ceived for all the metals makes
it certain that the enactment of
the measure into law will mean
the immediate development of
many valuable mines, so that
the Indians will soon be receiv
ing an income from royalties
and rentals that will be of great
assistance in advancing their
civilization. I am satisfied that
within a very few years after
this bill is in operation a num
ber of Indian tribes will be re
ceiving enough money from this
source to provide for their edu
cation and support, so that it will
be no longer necessary for con
gress to appropriate funds from
the treasury for the purpose."
The bill, which was passed
without dissenting vote, is cal
culated to do immeasurable good
to the mining industry of the
state. It opens to the prospect
or and miner all the rich areas
of the Indian reservations here
tofore it has been unlawful for
prospectors to enter. At the
same time it safeguards the
rights of the Indians by requir
ing that lands operated for min
ing or smelting purposes shall
pay a fair rental annually to the
government.
Mining on Indian Reservations.
Congressman Hayden has suc
ceeded in passing through the
House his bill authorizing min
ing for metaliferous minerals on
Indian reservations. The bill
provides for leasing unnallotted
Indian lands for thirty years
with preferential right to re
new leases for successive periods
of ten years at royalty of not
less than five per cent. Leases
cannot be revoked except by
proceedings in the United States
courts. Nearly twenty million
acres of reserved lands will be
thrown open to prospecting
when the Hayden bill becomes
a law. Signal.
Because he had a small ilask
of whiskey in his possession,
Jos. H. Weltner was arrested
while motoring across the San
Carlos Indian reservation from
New Mexico. Weltner who is
a local business man had been
called to New Mexico on busi
ness and was returning to his
his home in Globe. He did not
see any Indiana while crossing
the reservation.
