WILL 8-HOUR LAW
STAND COURT TEST?
Railway Officials Say they Will Ignore it, and their
Lawyers Say it will Crumble at First Legal Blast.
Trainmen Seem Satisfied and Await Results.
Now thut the threatened tjen
orul strike of railway trainmen Is
a thing of the past and Ho longer
occupies the front pages W the
newspapers, we should not forget
It. The political bunk that now
appears in the newspaper is cal
culated to do that very thing.
Hut let us see what has really
happened. We are supposed to
have aa 8-hour law tor men in
the railway train service, (effect
ive January 1. Only about 20
per cent of railway employes are
thus engaged. What authority
has congress to discriminate be
tween different employes or the
same railroad'.' fan it say that
SO per cent shall work ten hours
and 'J.0 per cent only eight? In
there not reason to believe that
a well trained federal judge can
find in this the germs of class leg
islation and declare the law un
constitutional ?

once and that the president
would have his commissioa on the
job to see how it worked. But
when I hoarded a train Saturdaj
1 discovered my mistake.
At Chaffee 1 discussed the lavs
with Wm. Carroll, a Frisco engin
eer I soon discovered that he had
a Ereat deal of confidence in law
and courts. But as to the mean
ing of the law, we could 1 not a
SL at all. He held that tbe
commission provided for to be
appointed by the president, weuld
not begin its observation until
January 1. when the law becomes
effective. I held that the lav,
did not say so. Here it is : ,
"Sec. 2. That the president shall
aDDolnt a commission of three
Which shall observe the operation
and effects of the Institution of
the 8-hour standard workday as
above defined and the facts and
conditions affecting the relations
between such common carriers
and employes during a period of
NOT LFSS THAN SIX MONTHS,
nor more than N1NK MONTHS. In
the discreetiou of the commis
sion, and within THIRTY DAYS
thereafter such Commission shall
leport its findings to the presi
dent and congress. . . The
sum of .$25,000 or so much there
of as may be necessary, be. and
hereby is, appropriated out of
any money in the United States
tieasury not otherwise appropri
ated, to be IMMEDIATELY a ail
able and to continue available un
til the close of the fiscal year
ENDING June 30, 1017,'' etc.
Now, this law does HOT say
when the commission shall begin
its work, but it DOES say that on
June 30, 1017, its pay shall stop.
And commissions always disband
when their pay stops. The law
ulso provides that the money to
pay the expense of the commis
sion shall be "immediately avail-
able."' What for if the work
is not to begin until January'.'
Let us now see where we are at
Suppose the work begins Janua
ry 1. The law says the commis
sion must observe the operation
and effects of the new law lor
AT EE A.ST six: months, and that
it then has 3J days in which to
report its findings. That would
be seven months. How is it pos
sible to get in seven months be
tween January 1 and June 30. of
the same year? Yet tbe commis
sion is uiveu power to investigate
tor nine mouths, If necessary. Add
to this 30 days in which to re
port, and you nave ten months'.
Sec. 3. That, lending the RE
PORT of the commission herein
provided for, and for a period of
30 duys thereafter, the compen
sation of railway employes sub
ject to this act for a standard
8-hour work day shall not be
reckoned below tne present stan
dard da, s' wage, and for ull ne
cessary time In excess of 8 hours
such employes shall be paid at a
rate not less than pro rata rate
for such standard 8-hour work
day. lou will notice that Sec. 3 pro
vides that pending the REPORT
and for 30 days thereafter, the
trainman shad receive the ten
hours' pay lor eight hours work,
and pro rata for over time. But
it DOES NOT say PENDING the
INVESTIGATION, which is sup
posed to begin alter the law be
comes effective January 1. If
the law means that the shorter
hours with the same pay shall be
conie effective January 1, why
doesn't it say so'.' There is a dit
ference between the meaning of
the terms investigation' and
report.''
When 1 reminded Mr. Carroll
that some of the railroad heads
had announced they would Ignore
the luw, he hooted at it. "Why,"
said he. -there is a penalty of not
less than ?100 nor more than one
thousand dollars, or imprisonment
for one year, or both, for EACH
and EVERY violation. Do you
suppose tuey are going to take
any chances like that ? 1
1 suggested that the penalty
for violations of the Sherman
auti trust law was much more
severe, yet that law had not hin
dered the growth of trusts and
the sting ol the penalty had only
been felt by organized labor. But
Mr. Carroll is mistaken about the
penal clause. Here it is:
See. 4. That anj person vio
lating any provision of this act
shall be guilty oi a misdemeanor
and upon conviction shall be lin
ed not less than SlUO unJ not
more then si.uo.t. ur llliprh
inent uot to exceed uiu . '
both.''
Do you find anything ah u,
EACH AND EVERY violation III
that ? It appears in other penal
clauses, but for some mysterious
reason it does not appear here I
A railroad corporation may vio
late this law toward all of its
employes Indefinitely, and the
highest penalty that could be im
posed is 81,000 fine. As for the
imprisonment provision, that is a
Joke. Who ever heard of rail
road managers going to jail no
matter what they did to the law?
The more I consider the "pnek
age"' handed to the trainmen by
the president and congress, the
more I become satisfied that the
trainmen were handed a beauti
fully polished gold brick.
E. P. Ripley, a railroad presi
dent, is quoted as saying : "Our
lawyers have expressed the opin
ion that the Adamson law will
crumble at the first legal blast."
Tbe evident purpose of the per
formance at Washing was to put
off final action until after the
election. The railroad press, Re
publican and Democratic, told us
of how the president was on the
job pushing things. On Friday be
fore the bill passed the senate on
Saturday, they told us that the
president was working overtime
and would be right In his office
ready to sign the bill as soon as
passed. So interested was the
president in behalf of the train
men that he hardly took time to
eat or sleep, according to these
kept newspapers.
But when the final show-down
came on Saturday evening, it was
admitted that the president was
not in Wnsington at all when the
bill finally passed, but at his sum
mer home in New Jersey. And he
signed the bill on Sunday as be
passed thru Washington in his
private car on his way to Ken
tucky to make a Hieech.
During the two weeks the show
was on at Washington, the Globe-
Democrat knew the president's
position and had no orltlcism to
make of it. in faet. it appeared
to sanction the efforts of the
president and congress In pre
venting the strike.
Not a word was heard from Mr.
Hughes. But as soon us the strike
was called off, then Mr. Hughes,
the 0 lobe-Democrat and other
Republican organs began a tirade
of criticism.
They say congress acted cow
ardly in permitting itself to be
bullied and coerced by Labor.
There is no truth in any such
accusation. Labor neither bullied
nor coerced congress. The labor
officials were In New Vork to try
to get concessions from the rail
way officials. When they found
that the railway officials would
yield nothiiig, they sent out the
strike order for noon. August 21.
Nothing had been said to either
the president or congress.
Rut it was at this point that
the president interfered and in
vited both the labor officials and
the railway heads to confer with
him at Washington. Labor men
could not ignore the president
and hope to retain public sympa
thy, which is the all-powerful
factor In a labor dispute.
Labor asked nothing of either
the president or congress. The
president ind congress were tak
ing care of their own political
bides. They didn't want a gen
eral strike on f.he eve of an elec
tion. In one respect, however, the tie
up of railroad traffic might have
proved a blessing. Hugues and
Wilson could not have got over
the country to make speeches.
For two weeks the labor offi
cials loitered around Wasington
out of respect for the president.
Finally 04J of them got tired and
went home leaving ouly a couple
of dozen in Wastiiiigtou. And con
gress did nut act until after these
040 had left Washington. Where
was there any bullying or coer
slon about that'.'
And while Democratic organs
and spell-binders will claim this
act as an evidence that they are
friends of labor,'' they did it for
no other purpose than to put off
Settlement until alter the elec
tion. What the president and eongres
did settled nothing. The law
does not become effective until
January 1, and the railroad offi
cials say they will then ignore it
until tested in the courts. This
means expensive litigation for a
long time. And Labor has no bet
ter chance In court than in arbi
tration. Says the Milwaukee
Leader :
"The pauic haste with which
congress rushed thru the 8-hour
law was not caused by a desire
to help the railroad workers, but
by the threat to private prlflts
ll that bill increases wages S."0,
000,000, as is claimed, the rail
road presidents and Inter-State
commission ,wlll see to it that
the final result Will be increased
profits nearer 82."O.OUO,000 pel
year.
The railroad owners want
higher rates. They want to save
all the water in their stock. They
want to cover up with heapinn
dividends the crimes of stock aim
bond manipulation.
The interstate commerce 0O1U-
mission did not dare to permit an
increase. The righteous indigna
tion of the public against two
generations of banditry was too
hot to make another legalized
raid politically safe.
Too large a section of the pop
ulation had learned that the ou
ly way out is public ownership.
There was danger of n political
uprising in favor of such owner
ship if higher rates Nvere again
added to the crushing cost of liv
ing. Uut if congress "compels'' the
roads to reduce hours, Wilson has
promised to pack the inter-state
commission with members that
will grant the desired Increase.
One dollar will be handed to the
employes to furnish an excuse
for taking five from the public.
There is up promise to pack the
supreme court with members who
will declare the 8-hour law con
stitutional, and the railroads are
preparing to smash it 'As soon as
it has served its purpose ns an
excuse for higher rates.
When all the storm has blown
away, the employes win no bun
koed, the public skinned and the
railroad corporations will have
the swap.
And there will be more strikes
and more danger of Starving a
nation of one hundred .and ten
million jieople,

The Wilson administration is
entitled to one measure of credit
that seems to be ignored. The
trust-busting farce has been put
on ice. During the Taft adminis
tration Attorney General Wicker
sham occupied the front of the
6tage. The present attorney
general just sits quiet and draws
his (my. His name seldom ap
pears in print. The busting of
Standard Oil seems to have sat
isfied all of the trust-busters.
THE PROOF.
The first tiling a "free born
American cittsen" wants when his
grand-pa ideas are jolted, is the
proof. And theu he wont believe
it if he can help it.
For years the Socialists have
; been trying to pound it into the
j heads uf the toileis that the id
I lers get the greatel pint. on of
what they produce. But they
can t see it and insist on keeping
the Idlers in control ul govern

Let's see if we no, have the
positive proof. The automoblli
business is ake any other manu
facturing business that employes
Imuob labor. Henry Ford is a pe
culiar capitalist. He appears to
! be no ho.
! .Ford is in the automobile man
ufacturing business and sold his
machines it about the same price
as other makers. Tbrcv years
ago he discovered that his prof
its for one year Were ten million
; dollars and that hi only had ten
'million dollars invested in the
automobile plant
Ford decided that be was get

Ail of th shrewd business men
predicted bankruptcy for Ford.
But at the end of tne year his
profits were itiu ten million.
With the increased pay the men
were so much better able tu care
for themselves and families that

and they produced mure.
Ford then reduced the price Of
his car's, and announced that he
would share profits w ith his cus
tomers Duriug August of last
year every purchaser of a ford
car received a check of 3r,u,
making his ear , .,st him s"0 less
trisn he expected.
But the lord profits continued
to grow , and this year, when eve
rything else is going out of sight
in price, Ford reduces the price of
his cars from about 7.'. 1 know
of no other thing that is lower
now than before the European
war.
Do yuu need any further proof
Ol tbe w orking of the robber
system: And mat .t Is the work-
lers who are robbed?
The workers produce enough tu
give them all a splendid living,
but the Idlers take it frum them
and leave them ouly enough for
existence. The thing fur the
wor ker to do is to locate the key
the capitalists have that uidu.ks
the stores of wealth the workers
produce, arid smash it.
