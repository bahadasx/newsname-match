After severe fighting on the

were forced back through
the villages of Courcellette,
Martinpuich and Flers. The
town of Combles, the state
ment adds, was held by the
Germans in the face of
strong British attacks.
LONDON, September 16.?
The heavy offensive launched
yesterday by the British north of
the Somme, the most powerful in
weeks, was successful in gaining
ground along the entire line, ex
cept immediately opposite Ginchv
where the German* clung on des
perately, today's mspatches indi
cate.
The most important points
gained were the villages of Cour
cellette. east of Thiepval; Martin
puich, south of the Pozieres
Bapaume road, and Flers, two
miles north of Ginchy. These
three villages now are completely
in possession of the British. A!
greater part of Boileaux wood
also was taken. German counter
attacks have failed.
The Germans also have begun
counter attacking the French at
points where they recently ad
vanced, both north and south of
the Somme. Paris today reports
the repulse of German attacks
east of Clery, immediatelv north
of the stream, and near Berny, be-1
low the river, southeast of Es
trees.
French Make Big Gain.
North of the Somme. the French
forces yesterday took a system of
trenches 500 meters deep from the Ger
mans north of the Jjh Priez farm, thus,
with the aid of the British, rendering
th*- encirclement of the town of Com
bles closer, says the war office com
' inanimation issued last night- Berlin
admits I>e Priez farm has been taken.
1? is added #that near Bemy-en-San
terre, south of the Somme, three Ger
, man trenches and 200 prisoners, five of
them officers, were captured. Success
j ful aviation operations also were car
ried out on the Somme front.
On the right bank of the Meuse (Ver
: dun front), the Germans attempted
twi'" to attack French lines west of
1 the Fort Vaux road, but French ma
chin* gun fire drove thern back to the
trer.?-hes. according to Paris.

Curtails U. S. Shipments. |
LONDON. September 14 (delayed).
The plan of rationing the neutral coun
tries of Norway, Sweden, Denmark and
Holland, under which no further licenses
will be granted for the present to Brit
ish exporters, has been extended to ap
ply to the United States by the ex
pedients of refusing to allow the Neth- I
erlands Oversea Trust to accept fur
ther American ? consignments, and by
declining to grant letters of assurance
ror American shipments destined for
these countries.
f?rnL7CC!P*e2ucn,c,e' American shipments

panies trading between the United
?Mates and Scandinavia will not take
cargoes without assurances of their In
nocent destination by the authorities, j
Furthermore, tramp steamers are hard
ly likely to risk the inevitable land- I
ing in the prize court of any cargo
they might accept. j
Two Reasons for Action.
Neutral diplomats here believe two j
reasons induced the British government
to take this action The first is the sim
plicity of the plan, which enables the
government to control supplies at the
source. The second is the growing bill
with which Great Britain is being
pressed by neutral governments for
demurrage and other expenses incurred
by taking suspected ships into Kirkwall
and other ports for examination.
So far as Is known, no machinery exists
at present for adjusting these claims, 'as
many of these cargoes never actually
reach the prize court. When shippers ask
for compensation they are referred to the
prize court, which thus far has declined
to consider their claims on the ground
tnat they have no standing In-court.
XT. S. Inquiry Is Expected.
It is expected that Washington will
make an inquiry In regard to this mat
ter, especially as to the American schoon
ers which were taken Into Lerwick and
released after being detained for several
weeks. No charges were prefaced against
them.
Another blockade measure which also
probably will Interest Washington Is the

FOR LAW TO FIX
WEIGHT OF LOAF
G. M. Roberts, Superintendent
of Weights, Measures and
Markets, Favors Idea.
WILL SUBMIT PROPOSAL
TO THE COMMISSIONERS
Milk Producers Marking Time in Ef
fort to Get "Middlemen" to Pay
More for Product.
Washington may have a bread
law, fixing the weight of the loaf
to be sold at a certain price, if
plans now being matured by
George M. Roberts, superintend
ent of the District markets,
weights and measures, are carried
out. Australia has such a law,
fixing the weight of a seven-cent
loaf at two pounds, and Mr. Rob
erts today said he was endeavor
ing to find a copy of it in Wash
ington, and will take the subject
up with the District Commission
ers, in the hope of having the lat
ter press for the passage of a Dis
trict bread law by Congress.
This was the principal development
today in the general subject of the in
creased cost of living which is arousing
such general attention in Washington,
owing to the attempt now being made
to increase tiie prices of milk, bread
and other staples. The milk producers
are "marking time" until their proposed
meeting Tuesday, when they will at
tempt to get the "middlemen" to agree
to pay more for milk, but Supt. Roberts
announced at the District building to
day that he is making a study of the
subject of bread prices and weights,
with a view to recommending legisla
tion such as Australia has.
To Study Situation Here.
"For many years a loaf of bread was
supposed to weigh a pound," Mr. Rob
erts said today, "and it seems to me an
anomalous condition that bakers should
be prevented from combining to fix
their prices, but may combine to fix
their weights, by reducing the size of
the loaf. That is just another way of
^fixing prices. So I have decided to
make a study of what is being done by
the bakers of Washington and will
bring the facts before the District Com
missioners."
A correspondent of The Star today in
quired why it is if the increased cost
of wheat a? a consequence of the war
has raised the price of bread in the
United States (by* decreasing the size
of the joaf) a two-pound loaf should
sell by law at 7 cents in Australia,
which is a belligerent country. This in
quiry was answered by Charles J.
Brand, chfcf of the ofhce of markets
and rural organization of the'Agricul
tural Department, with the statement
that bread is cheap in Australia be
that bread is cheap there, in view of
the fact that Australia is one of the
greatest grain producing countries of
the world and the war has halted much
of her exports of grain. This, irrespec
tive of the law.
"For the same reason," Mr. Brand
added, '"bread is cheaper in Russia to
j day than it has ever been. Russia, too,
is one of the greatest grain producing
I cpuntries of the world, and sh?* has had
I three crops of wheat, all of which she
t has not been able to export because of
! the war.'

GREAT BRITISH DRIVE THRILLING;
DOGGED PERSISTENCE WINS
Ludicrous Looking Motor Cars, Sun Brown
ed Troops and Huge Guns Hew Way
to Success North of Somme.
BRITISH FRONT IN FRANCE. Sep
tember 16, 1 a.m., via London.?Army
officers universally are speaking of
Friday as the best day for the British
arms since the offensive began on the
Somme front. . With the exception of
July 1, the attack begun yesterday
morning was the most extensive of any
in the ten weeks of the battle. For
i the flr3t time new armored motor cars
I of ingenious pattern, suitable for cross
| ing trenches and shell holes, competed
with the infantry as the British swept
down from the ridges to the lower ground
toward Bapaume. At this writing the
British are beyond the village of Flers,
which they took early in the morning,
land are established in Martinpuich and
Courcellette.
Germans Fig-ht Hard.
The slow, plodding work of recent
weeks, which included the taking of
Ginchy and Guillemont, had for its ob
ject control of all the high ground
from the region of Thiepval to the
Junction -with the French on the right. |
The Germans fought hard for every
foot of it. Delville, or Devil's wood;
High wood, and the rib of earth ,
which the windmill crowned beyond Po
zieres have been steeped with blood i
of men fallen there, in their long stand
under the heaviest orgy of shellfire in
the history of war, as experts agree,
as German wrestled with Briton, not
for a piece of farmland, but for mili- j
tary and human mastery.
Push Largely Down Hill.
The British push was largely down
hill. They had behind them the high
ground, whose slopes give them shel
ter for their guns, and whose crest
'gives them observation for their artil
lery fire. Evidently the Germans did
not expect the attack, considering that
the offensive was over and that the
British would settle down for the win
ter in their new and advantageous
positions. Never before, probably, have
more guns been playing over the same
length of front than along the six miles
where the British made their advance
on July 1, and Where they have con
tinued their offensive with phlegmatic
I and dogged persistence.
The Germans kept on bringing up
guns until now they have 1,000 in this
short sector. The Associated Press cor
| respondent, moving over the region of
the devastated villages and shell-torn
earth, intersected by new roads, saw on
Thursday how enormously the British
had increased their own artillery.
Guns Are Kept Busy.
j Sun-tanned and weather beaten were
the gunners, after their ten weeks of
work. There were lines and clusters
and parks of guns. Rows of batteries
were firing with something of the
regularity of mechanical workmanship
of the needles of a loom weaving cloth.
Alongside each other were British'and
French batteries. The gunners of
neither ally could speake the language
of the other, yet both were going on
with their parts according to charted
instructions. At midnight the corre
spondent again walked about among
the guns, which were going on with
their night shift of gunners, whose
figures were illuminated by flashes.
Except for the guns, which know no
rest, the army seemed silent and asleep,
for the most part. Everybody and
everything was in place and ready, in
cluding those strange grotesque new
armored cars, which were to have their
baptism of fire in the morning.
"Battle Is Great Teacher."
"We keep on learning, we of the new
army," said one of the young officers,
"and with every show we do a little
better. Battle is the great teacher."
"And the guns never stopped their
ear-racking noise from daylight to
darkness, and darkness to dawn. Now
/
and then the keys of that strident pi
ano were struck in a chord. When
dawn came all the keys began to bang
at once.
But before the general attack began
there had been a hellish little prelimi
nary side show near Thiepval. The
Germans had there a warren of deep
dugouts and galleries which they
called their "wunder werk." Before
daylight the British got in there, under
cover of their gunfire, bombed their
way through galleries which became
catacombs and made themselves master
of the position after hours of ugly
work.
Germans Make Small Gain.
Then, also before sun-up, only an
hour before the time set for the Brit
ish attack, the Germans, who had no
idea the British were coming on in an
other big push, made a small attack in
the neighborhood of Mouquet farm.
They took a section of trench, and
were holding it at the moment when
that wave of British, six miles long,
began to move. The British reserves in
that area swept over the Germans* and
their own men, who were struggling
with the Germans, on to the objective
set for three days' work.
A chill autumn morning mist, preced
ing a day of brilliant sunshine, hid the
actual attack, which the British offi
cers think was the most skillful the
British army has ever made. The Brit
ish were putting behind them not only
the rid^e, but the old second line, as
well as the first line trenches, which
they stru^Kled so hard to gain, and
were going against the new third line,
which the Germans had been building
under unceasing British shellfire.
Soldiers Laugh at Cars.
With the infantry went those new
motor cars, across trenches and shell
holes. So ludicrous are they in appear
ance that the British soldiers laughed
at them in the midst of the charge.
They cheered them as they played their
streams of machine-gun bullets. Like
some prehistoric monsters they must
have seemed to the Germans who had !
to seek dugouts or flight or else they j
surrendered. i
So far as reports indicate tonight the ]
British everywhere gained possession of
the new German trenches, except oppo
site Ginchy. There the Germans clung
with desperate courage and dog-to-bone
tenacity to remain on that bit of high
ground in that piece-by-piece defense of
his. There he still keeps up the strug
gle, at last accounts.
Again in High wood he had kept a
redoubt with a nest of machine guns
which the armored motor ears engaged,
machine gun to machine gun, while the
British infantry passed around it as
around a rock in a flood.
Six Colonels Are Prisoners.
Among the prisoners are six colonels.
One of these had the honor of being cap
tured by the newest weapon, which has
added picturesqueness to present day
warfare. This armored motor car, which
crosses trenches and holes, ran over the
colonel's dugout. He surrendered to the
crew, which took him on board and after
the fight was over delivered him to a
guard of infantry.
In one case 100 Germans surrendered
in a body to one of the armored motors.
Again an aeroplane reported than one of
the motors was moving up a street of
the village of Flers, while wildly yelling
British infantry followed it.
Aeroplanes descend very low during
.the battle and never were there more
fights or more vicious ones than those of
today, while the new armored cars were
participating in the infantry charges.
Altogether the British brought down thir
teen German planes. (
Troops IHib Armored Cars "Willies."
LONDON, September 16.-The reference
in thesofficial communication issued by
the war office yesterday afternoon to a
new type of armored car is the first
official memtlon of a development that
has been muc^ whispered about recent
--.u. ?? V. -K ?? is
Iy in army circles. Those who have seen
the new vehicles refer to them as
"tanks," while the soldiers who have
been handling them have- given them
the nickname of "Willies."
The object that the designers sought
to obtain was to render a heavily arm
ored motor car capable of being
operated in the shell torn and'roadless
wilderness of trenches where it is
evident a vehicle mounted on ordinary
wheels could not be used.
Although no details of the car's con
struction have been published th?
Times says: "Our inventors have not
hesitated boldly to tread unbeaten
paths. We may imagine the feeling of
German infantry in shell battered
trenches when in the uncertain light
of dawn they saw advancing upon them
an array of unearthly monsters cased
in steel spitting fire and crawling
laboriously, but ceaselessly over trench
es, barbed wire and shell craters."

TO THWART STRIKE
Street Railway Officials in New
York Consider Charges
of Conspiracy.
UNIONS ARE TAKING VOTE
ON SYMPATHETIC WALKOUT
Leaders Claim 70.000 Will Quit
Monday, and Promise to Tie
Up Water Front.
NEW YORK, September 16.?
While labor leaders were perfect
ing plans for a sympathetic walk
out by 70,000 or more workers to
aid the striking street railway
men, officials of the Interborough
Rapid Transit Company, against
which the fight is principally di
rected. discussed today the possi
bility of instituting action charg
ing conspiracy against the union
leaders.
Business Men Co-Operating.
Business men and merchants who
have suffered heavily because of the
! traction tie-up are said to be co-operat
j ing in the movement to restrain the
labor leaders. James L. Quackenbush,
general . ounsel for the Interborough.
said in this connection that his assist
ants are collecting evidence of the
transactions of the union leaders, and
that when "sufficient cumulative ev
idence had been secured and conditions
so demand, action will be taken."
Mr. Quackenbosh said he was certain
his company could obtain an injunction
restraining- the strikers and their
leaders from interfering with the loyal
employes of the Interborough in the
event such a course is deemed advis
able.
"The present intention," said Theo
dore P. Shonls, president of the Inter
borough, "is not to proceed against the
strike leaders on criminal charges. It
might be wise to take the initiative,
and the legal staff is studying condi
tions with a view to preparing for de
velopments."
Vote on Sympathetic Strike.
Several trade ujiions voted today for the
purpose of determining their response tc
the call for a sympathetic strike tc
back up the striking street car em
ployes. By Monday labor leaders ex
pect to learn the sentiment of the long
shoremen, teamsters, tidewater boat
men, coal bargemen and stationary en
gineers and firemen, to whom the car
men have particularly addressed their
appeal. By Monday they assert 70,000
men will be called out "to protect" the
very life of union labor in New York."
The union leaders announce that the
majority of the members of machin
ists' unions, having a membership of
25,000, have voted to strike at munition
plants in this city as a protest to the
financial interests controlling the sub
way, elevated and street car lines.
To Tie Up Water Front.
Should the longshoremen, boatmen
and coal barge workers go out, the
strike leaders say virtually all work
along the water front will be tied up.
The police commissioner has been in
formed that 8,0(>0 coal bargemen will
quit work today. It is stated that tTie
longshoremen have voted almost un
animously to go out.
This movement is described by the
Central Federated Union as "prelimi
nary to a general strike." While it is
estimated there are 800,000 trade union
ists in New York, it is said the leaders
do not count upon calling out more
than 400,000 of them as an extreme
measure.
Aimed at Big- Financiers.
Union leaders attach much impor
i tance to the action of the machinists,
I about 70 per cent of whom are said to
j have voted for a strike. Most of them
j are employed in plants manufacturing
munitions of war for the entente allies.
The effect of the strike in that trade,
they say, would be a direct blow at the
i Morgan interests, the largest holders of
stock in the Interborough Rapid Tran
sit Compahy. J. P. Morgan /fc Co. are
the fiscal agents of the British govern
ment in this country.
One man was killed and thirty-four
were injured in accidents on the ele
vated and surface car lines within the
last twenty-four hours.
The most serious was a rear-end col
lision between two trains on the Third
avenue elevated line near 59th street
station. Many passengers suffered
severe injuries.
Two trolley cars were in collision in
the Bronx and four persons, one a
patrolman, on strike duty, were injured.
It is said the cars were being operated
by strikebreakers.
Surface Service Improved.
Although surface cars service was
much improved over previous days, sub
way and elevated trains were more
crowded today than at any timfe since ;
the strike was called. Several women;
fainted and many persons suffered
minor bruises in the crush.
The public service commission brought
its inquiry into the strike to a close
late yesterday. The statement issued
with regard to the situation on the
Third Avenue Railroad Company's lines
said there was no evidence of bad faith
on the part of the company or any in
