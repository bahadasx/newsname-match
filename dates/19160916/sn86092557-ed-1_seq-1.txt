Board of Health Takes Step
After Consulting State
Officials
SCHOOLS ST EFFECTED1:
All 'Pupils Required To Present
Health Certificates
IJV The quarantine of theaters, and
. "Sunday schools and all other public '
gatherings was lifted today by the :
City Board of Health after a consultatlon
this morning with the State
. Health Board of West Virginia. This i
action was taken because of the pres- i
ent cold wave which has reached this i
section and Dr. Welrich of the State i
Board, who Is In direct charge of the i
Paralysis situation In this state, ]
thought that the rigid quarantine i
would no longer be needed.
DThe local Health Board met this ]
morning and formulated an official
order which will lift the ban on the |
moving picture theaters and Sunday ,
. schools and which goes Into effect .
today. The regulations which effect
the city schools however are still in effect
and the local schools will not '
open until Monday. September 25. at
which time all children admitted will
be required to present health certlfl- ,
sates from their physician.
The order requiring tho children to |
Iliicoout iicaiiu uci iwi^uicn is uun u<3" i
lng prepared by the local Health
' Board and will be published Monday.
i -A uniform blank Health certificate Is
jv- being printed and these will be dls- ,
trlbuted by the Board at the City of- ,
. flcea on the first floor of the City
building. All phyisicans in the city 1
, will be required to use these blanks 1
j for the work of examination of the 1
children and may Obtain them-at the- 1
|&city offices.
SThe plan of having a number of
6". physicians present at the schools
when they are opened to examine the
SgVchtldren, was abandoned as brine im[.'"- practical
since there are more than
K&three thousand prospective pup::? to
be enrolled at this time. Thus It is
J:Y estimated that it will require the time
.of practically all the physicians in
I ; the city the greater portion of next
'r-V week to properly Inspect the children
.. /tor the possibility of infectious and
; communicable diseases. A small fee
fc. will of course be charged by the phyt1
slclans for this inspection but the
J" Board of Health and the city phy"
Siclan Dr. C. M. Ramagc will examine
-.4 free ny child whose parents are un- j
able to pay te fee.
A certai.. amount of opposition has
been found to these measures of the
Health Board but the order will bo
4 thoroughly enforced and will in the
R; end be the means of saving a con"
-siderable sum of the patrons of the
X- echools since it will reduce to the
t':. minimum the possibility of an out
r- break of any enidemic such as whooD- ;
y- ing cough, measles, scarlet fever,
diphtheria or Infantile paralysis, i
There are a number of cases of scar...
let fever now In the community al,
though not within the city limits.

Elks Band and Silver Drum
Corps Provide
Music
Ninety-seven bravo hearted veterans,
scared and worn by the ravages of war
and time, marched with the spirit of
11 and the light of memory In their
eyes this morning at Mannington in
the county G. A. R. parade. The Elks'
hand and the Silver Dram corps furnished
the music for tho parade and in
the line following the old soldiers were
many of the prominent citizens of the
town and the school children who had
turned out to give homage to the remaining
members of the organization.
Chief Watts of the Mannington police
department acted as marshal of
ine parauo wmcn tormeu on fliarKel
stret and mar/hed over the principal
streets of the city. Fourteen automobiles
were In line many of which carried
the more aged and feeble of the
veterans who were unable to march
in the line.
The number of veterans present at
the re-unlon this year was approximately
twenty-five less than attended
last year and many of those present
this year will fail to answer the roll
call next year at the annual re union
which is to be held on the East Side
at Fairmont, the invitation extended
by the East Side veterans yesterday
at the last business session having
been accepted.
Plans are now under way to form a
tn-county Soldiers' asslciation which
will include the veterans from Marlon,
Harrison and Monongalia counties. A
coipmlttee was named to work out
the details of this new organization
at the business sepslon yesterday as
follows: T. N. Swisher, E. A. HUlingslea.
John M. Milts a, J. T. Musgrave.
The officers elected for the new
year of the Marlon County Ro-TJnion

Work on New Addition Is
Now Under
Way
STEP IN CITH GROWTH
Fairmont Improvement As-,
sociation Will Take Up .
Freight Interchange
The extension of the Willetts Clay
company's plant on the East Side Is
the next step toward the development
of Fairmont that Is being carried out
with the co-operation of the Fairmont
Improvement Association. Work has
already begun on the enlargement of
this piant which when the new additions
are completed will employ approximataely
seventy-five men. The
present plant when running full capacity
employs about fifty men and the
proposed extension will increase the
capacity of the plant thirty-three and
one-third per cent. This company is
engaged In the manufacture of fire
clay blocks for glass tanks and furnaces.
and a branch factory near Pittsburgh
also manufactures clay potit for
melting? glass by the individual furnace
method.
Mr. Willetts of the Willetts company
was in Fairmont yesterday and consulted
with the Enlargement and Extension
of Present Industries commit,
tee of the Improvement Association in
regard to the possible aid that the local
association might render his company
and stated that his problems
were three. One of these the labor
problem, was not taken up by the committee.
The company will need in the
neighborhood of 40 additional men at
the plant when the extension is completed.
The shipping problem of the plant
was referred to the Traffic and Rate
committee which will endeavor to have
a better adjustment of the Interchange
agreement between the B. & O. and
the Monongahela railway worked out.
The company still has $10,000 worth
of 6 per cent, serial bonds In their
treasury and the floatation of these
will be taken up by the Finance committee
of the Improvement Assocla
tlon. This company is sound In every
respect and of the original $50,000
bond issue, have retired $10,000 of
their outstanding sum.
The officers of the Willetts Clay
company are largely local men and
the majority of the stock in the concern
is owned by local investors. Following
are the present officers: H. G.
Willetts, president: Anthony Dowen.
vice president: C. S. Rlggs, treasurer;
Rollo J. Conley, secretary.
City Hall Notes
J. Walter Barnes, Finance Commissioner
spent the morning in Barnesvile
today where he watched the progress
of the work about the Barnes
school. The grounds there are being
repaired, new walks put in and a
string of pavements from Bellview
avenue to the school being laid. This
is one of the greatest improvements
of public works made in Bellview for
years.
City Superintendent of schools O.
G. Wilson will hereatfer have his office
at the Municipal Building. Two
vacant rooms have been opened at the
city building for Professor Wilson
where be will be better able to meet
people. By giving up his offices at
the Butcher school he leaves more
room for the students.
Ira Smith, water commissioner, is
busy today on Locust avenue where
he has a gang of men at work lowering
the water line along that street.
tVhen the water line was laid, limestone
was struck and who ever was
in charge of the work failed to blast

Oratory
(Special Dispatch to West Virginian)
WASHINGTON. D. C., Sept. 1G.?
When Senator William E. Borah, of
Idaho, delivers speeches at Fairmont,
and Morgantown on Monday and at
Wheeling on Tuesday the Republican
campaign in West Virginia may be
said to be a "go." Wblle Borah Is tbe
first oratorical gun of national caliber
to shoot In West Virginia, he will
not be the only armament of that magnitude
to be unlimbered In the Mountain
State. There will be others.
Charles Evans Hughes will visit the
state and deliver several speeches.
Col. Roosevelt will be heard at least
twice in West Virginia before the close
of the campaign. Their dates cannot
now bo given for they haven't been
settled on. but they will bo heard on
the hustings sure. So will Raymond
Robhins. the former Illinois Democrat
and Progressive leader, who is one of
the brightest stars that twinkle In the
Republican skies this year, which Is
saying a great deal, for Republican
stars are out >' In great numerical
strength, and are shining with unusual
brilliancy. Robhins was a great
drawing card in the Maine campaign
and Is credited with having a great
deal to do with rounding up the erstwhilA
PrnffPoaulvoa In thai In V?o.
half of the Republican candidates.
Others who have been Bccured for
speaking engagements In the state
and upon whose itineraries the committees
aro now at work, are Senator
Harding, of Ohio; Senator Cummins,'
of Iowa; Representative Nicholas
Longworth, of Cincinnati; Representative
J. Hampton Moore, of Philadelphia;
Representative Joe Fordney, all
well known leaders of national prominence.
and public speakers of the
