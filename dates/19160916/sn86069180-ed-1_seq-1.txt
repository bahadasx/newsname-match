BITTER
Feeling Against Discriminatory
anil Bulldozing Tactics of
England.
JAoyd George Admits Stealing
of American Merchants'
Business Secrets.
Henry Watterson Depicts True
Feeling Between America
and England.
HE PREDICTS WAR WITH US
Following the wave of Indigna
tion which swept over this country
against Great Britain when the
Irish patriots were murdered conies
a real bitter feeling against that
Government, and the American peo
ple are becoming more and more
aroused. The State Department Is
anxiously awaiting the British reply
to the American protest against the
unlawful seizure of United States
malls on tho high seas, and when
that reply Is received action will
be taken on the statement of
David Lloyd George to tho English
Parliament that the British War
Department was furnishing to other
departments of the British Govern
ment the information obtained from
the Inspection of United States
malls and other countries. Eng
land, It Is charged, has been hiding
behind the cloak of concerted ac
tion with the Allies In dealing with
the American Government, attempt
ing to explain her procrastination
in meeting American demands as
necessary because of her obligation
to consult the other parties inter
ested with her.
Of course this weak explanation
will not bo satisfactory and It Is
up to this Government to let Great
Britain understand that action will
take the place of words unless
there Is an early stoppage of her
illegal and bulldozing procedures.
It Is said that the United States
Government Is in possession of In
formation to prove that
First The British Government
by delaying American malls has
prevented the consummation of
business transactions by American
firms so that British subjects might
enter-bidsand" seize the buslneis.
Second The British War Office
through its censorship of the malls
has gathered for British govern
mental departments trade informa
tion that is of use to the British
Government and its subjects in car
rying on a commercial warfare with
the United States.
Third This commercial warfare
could not be waged except by In
formation thus obtained, and the
methods employed constitute a
violation of comity as well as of the
Universal Postal Union's regula
tions. Fourth The British blacklist
was based largely upon information
taken from tho malls on the high
seas and diverted to Kirkwall. The
British assumption that by enter
ing British Jurisdiction that nation
has a right to apply the censorship
is a dishonest assumption, as the
mall ships were forced to enter
British ports by British war vessels.
More fuel .was added to the flame
this week when a British torpedo
boat invaded the waters of the
Philippines, violating American
neutrality by holding up a Philip
pine steamer, taking both the ship's
manifesto and her passenger list.
This will certainly call for a vig
orous protest, and the suggestion
is being made that in the future
ships carrying United States malls
should be accompanied by one of
our warships and defy England to
hold them up. The Louisville Her
ald, along with other papers of the
Tnrv sirlnn Iinvfl defended EnE-
land's embargo on tobacco and can
probably see no wrong in robbing
our mails, this class of pro-English
sympathizers repeating the threat
made by England that if the United
States insists on fair treatment
there will be no more orders for
ammunition. As stated before, the
bitter feeling against England is
becoming more and more pro
nounced and no one realizes it more
than Editor Henry "Watterson, of
the Courier-Journal, who says as
follows in his paper:
"Outside a few Anglomanlacs
around about Boston England as
England has no friends in tho
United States and deserves none.
Nor is there any love for us among
tho English. The ruling caste in
England is our enemy. If there is
over another great war, as, pray
God, there may never be, it will
bo between the United States and
England.
"Away back in tho seventies of
the last century, nigh on to fifty
years ago, a young Kentuckian,
writing from .onaon to mo uuui-ler-Journal
of tho anti-American
feeling everywhere manifest, ex
claimed in a burst of extreme dis
gust of the nouveaux riches among
his .countrymen who were boot
licking the British lion and cooling
their heels in the outer rooms of
the Legation after invitations to
Court. 'It is my ambition to lead
a column of black-horse cavalry
across Trafalgar Square, up to the
Haymarket and through Piccadilly
to Hyde Park corner, camping
around Rotten Row and watering In
the Serpentine, thence to show these
varmits a thing or two.' Some

grievances to report, and the good
work of the Ladles' Auxiliary was
commended and promised united

In the action of the national con

One of the great achievements
of the New York convention of the
Pnthnlln ETwlornHnn wna' thn nnt.nnl
inauguration,Aofap"ecialJJMepa.rJb.Lci"4tiy
woman's question was a source of
irritation and agitation in federa
tion. Attempts to form a separate
federation of women failed re
peatedly. At the Toledo convention
in 1916 the Rev. Peter E. Dletz
started a campaign for a regular
woman's session as a permanent
feature of federation conventions.
There was a favorable response,
but much latent suspicion lest the
movement should again stress sep
aratist tendencies. Ho was in
structed by the woman's session,
however, to appoint a committee of
seven women to prepare a pro
gramme for the New York conven
tion.
This committee arranged a ses
sion of women for Tuesday morn
ing, August 22, the third day of
the convention. The day was in
augurated by a special mass In tho
Lady chapel of St. Patrick's Cathe
dral. Tho meeting was called to
order by tho Chairman, Miss Helen
M. Haney. From tho very start it
was apparent that the session would
be fruitful of result. cathedral
College Hall was filled with women
delegates an hour before the usual
convention time. A number of
splendid papers were read, and
with each number of the programme
the spirit and enthusiasm of the
assembly crew. Bishops McFaul
and Muldoon and John Whalen, as
President of the National Federa
tion, visited tho session and con
tributed their blessing and well
wishes. Toward the end of tho meeting
a discordant note was struck by a
strong opposition, which still clung
to tho delusion that the movement
was a separatist one, and though
no effort was spared to disabuse
tho existing prejudice a voto was
forced on the issue of "separation,"
which was decisive against separa
tion. "With It the session ad
journed. But the issue raised was
a false one and entirely beside
the purpose Qf the woman's session.
Tho friends of the movement there
fore promoted the plan for another
session on the same day, at which
tho original plan was again delib
erated and brought to a definite
purpose. Archbishop Messmer,
nftir nn address to tho assembly,
moved that tho committee of seven
be continued, that it be empowered
in wnrlr nut a resolution emooayiuB
the sense of the present delibera
tions, and that it present this reso
lution to tho Executive Board for
ratification. This motion of Arch
bishop Messmer was carried into
execution. , ,
The committee met on Wednes
h.v innrnlncr and drafted tho fol
lowing resolution: "We, the under
signed committee, representing the
women's session, respectfully sub
mit that: Owing to the wide scope
of work for women In federation,

LABORED FOR WELFARE NATIVES
California has proudly, uro-
2lahTied Iicr, debt to the friars, who
names which they still bear. Monu
ments have been erected to them
And books have been written of
them. Catholic and non-Catholic
have vied In paying tribute to them,
and but lately was there completed
the great historic work, "The Mis
sions and Missionaries of Califor
nia," appropriately written by a
friar, Zephyrin Engelhardt, which
will preserve for tho future Ameri
can people the story of .heir la
bors.
That other States have memorials
of tho missionary Franciscans as In
teresting and unique as those of
California Is not so widely known.
In that territory where now our
American soldiers are stationed, and
still farther to the north, did tho
sons of the Poverello of Asslssl
three hundred years ago travel in
their efforts for tho conversion of
tho Indian tribes located there. But
lately has a volume appeared telling
o tho missions established by them
In New Mexico, and now greater
attention is drawn to their work by
the private publication of a com
plete translation of the famous
Memorial of Fray Alonfio de Bena
vldes, "Commissary of the Holy Of
fice and Custodian that was of tho
Provinces and' Conversions of New
Mexico," made through his superiors
to the King of Spain. This memorial
was prepared in 1630.
In his report Benavldcs fur
nishes a striking description of tho
people with whom he camo in con
tact: Tho "nations which dwell
along tho road to New Mexico,"
"people very fierce, barbarous and
untamed," who "always go totally
naked, and have no house and do
no planting," reminding us of the
natives with whom Serra dealt In
California; "the Mansa nation of
tho Rio del Norte." who are always
encountered at the crossing of the
river, who "if they see their way, do
all the evil they can; but if un
able all come peacefully to seek
us, that wo may glvo them some
thing to eat," and who likewise are
naked and do no sowing; the many
tribes of New Mexico proper, of
various character, living mainly in
pueblos and In houses of adobe
(one and two stories and some
times three and four stories In
heights); and finally of the "huge
Apache nation," which surrounds all
the nations dwelling in pueblos,
and who are "a people very fiery
and bellicose, and very crafty In
war," and who "do not dwell in
settlements nor in houses, but in
tents and huts," moving "from
mountain range to mountain range,
RPPltlnc came, which Is their sus-
tpnnncn." Amone these various
peoples the missions were estab
lished.
In nil those Dlaces where sucn
establishments were made were the
Indians not alone instructed in
Christian doctrine but to read and
write and to play on Instruments
and sing, and In "all the trades of
civilization." Like a refrain does
the statement of this fact run
through the whole report of
Benavldes, giving a clear insight
Into tho policy of tho friars. Among
the Teoas nation we also read that
"the land is very fertile because a
religious has brought it water for
the irrigation of its seed-lands."
Ami in tho TTnmaa nation all the
I Indians were gathered together that
jjymrni8i'u;uB6i,ueirJ iumous cnain oi
were astray and were given "a
house we had made, and In it food
for some days, and plowed land
for their planting." In many such
ways did tho Franciscans labor fdr
tho temporal as well as spiritual
welfare of the natives.
Ho tells of tho difficulties and
sufferings of the religious from the
sorcerers of the people. He relates
tne story, too, of how peace was
made between some Christian tribes
and tho then heathen Navahos be
fore tho mission altar, leading to
tho conversion of the pagan chief.
It is one of the most interesting
anecdotes of the whole narration.
This memorial of Benavldes, It
should bo known, is to quote
Charles F. Lummis "one of the
scarcest of all Americana. A copy
of tho thin, parchmented volume,
printed in 1630 and of only 104
pages, is worth its weight In gold."
In the time of Its appearance It
received much attention and was
speedily translated Into four other
languages than the original Spanish.
Its translation into English Is most
welcome, because of this fact, and
because of the Insight it will glvo
American Catholics of the labors of
their missionaries and the part
these men played in the upbuilding
of this country. Their efforts are
too often forgotten, especially by
those of their own faith.

Upon reassembling the reports of
the State officers were read and re

GEORGIA'S DISGRACE.
The State of Georgia further
added to its disgrace and ignominy
Tuesday by electing Tom Watson's
candidate In the Gubernatorial
primary for Governor on the Demo

usually being equivalent to election.
The nomineo is Hugh .Oorsey, the
prosecutor of Leo Frank, whom
Watson's followers lynched after
the court trial. There are seve
counties In Georgia where 44 pe1
cent, of the people can neither read
or write; twenty-seven counties
where 50 per cent, can neither read
or write. Watson and his Ignorant

JUNIORS WANT SCHOOL CONTROL
The statements given out by tho
Republican Campaign Committee in
regard to the election in Malno be
ing a criterion for tho coming No
vember election can bo taken with
a grain of salt,, as they are intended
to bolster up the faithful, who
have become more down in tho
mouth as the campaign of Hughes
progressed. Leading political
critics, men that are neutral, still
classify Maine as a doubtful Stato
In tho coming Presidential race and
at the same time call attention to
the fact that Maine's electoral voto
of only six will hardly cut much
figure in tho result. This was
probably the first ray of comfort In
tho Republican camp sinco Hughes
camo out with his dampening
speech of acceptance, and the G. O.
P. is determined to make the most
of it, but it is evident that the men
behind tho gun really do not think
so much of tho result, judging from
the frantic efforts they are making
to get the public to warm up to
tho candidacy of Hughes, and as
some one remarked the other day
Maine was voting for local candi
dates and that vote could not bo
counted as an Indorsement of
Hughes.
The fight for control in the Re
publican party will not down and
it is being shown in the conduct
of the campaign. Chairman Wil
cox is a close friend of Hughes and
was selected by him in opposition
to the wishes of Crane, Barnes,
Penrose and tho Old Guard. Their
loud grumbling at the failure of tho
Hughes speaking tour compelled
Hughes and Wilcox to select A. T:
Hert, of local fame, as Vice Chairr,
Unah.f .ITertt'eiiiSfialose. f fitmd o"f
Fairbanks, and he Is representing
the Crane-Penrose-Barnes comblna-
tlon above referred to. Both fac
tions are working at cross pur
poses and a big split is sure to re
sult before tho campaign goes much
farther. On the other hand tho
smoothest politician In tho lot,
Roosevelt, Is planning to kill off
both at one swoop. As the cam
paign progresses ho will becomo
more and more bitter in his tirado
of tho German-Americans, then ho
will declare that he is for war right
off tho reel In the event Hughes 13
elected. This will frighten tho
peace advocates away from Hughes
and result in his defeat, just what
Teddy is planning for. With
Hughes beaten he will chaso tho
Penrose-Crane-Barnes combination
out of the party, assume control and
grab the nomination in 1920, Any
student of politics knows that
Roosevelt Is not playing second
fiddle to Hughes for tho benefit of
Hughes. Hughes' success might
mean re-election in 1920 and Teddy
is taking no chances.
Chairman Cantrlll and his as
sociates of the State Democratic
Committee are more than pleased,
with the progress of the campaign
in Kentucky and all are disposed to
laugh at the claims of Vice Chair
man Hert, who has been telling
Wall street and tho money kings
behind Hughes that Kentucky
would go Republican. Tho opening
of the campaign at Winchester was
a pretty good indication of tho
feeling In Kentucky, real Demo
cratic enthusiasm being manifested,
while the Hughes opening at Lex
ington received the proverbial frost
despite the frantic efforts of tho
Republican committee. Tho Old
Guafd of the G. O. P. was con
spicuous by its absence and tho feel
ing will not down that McCulloch,
Franks and their friqnds resent the
dictatorship of Hert, the new
tomer in Republican politics. In
Louisville a big Democratic ma
jority Is assured, as Congressman
Swagar Sherley will receive, in ad
dition to tho solid Democratic vote.
99 per cent, of the Independent
voto, and many of the solid Repub
lican business men of tho district
will support Sherley in preference
to Major Owens, tho man of many
parties. Nathan Kahn for Police
Court 'Prosecutor, Will Perry for
Stato Senator, Clay Hall for Police
Court Clerk and J. J. Johnson and
Ben Beckmann for Councilmen of
the First and Second wards should
run right close to Congressman
Sherley.
It has been commented upon In
these columns from time to time
concerning tho present mode of
selecting members of tho Board of
Education, tho two or three candl
dtaes selected by a few and the pub
lic having no voice. Another class
aro now planning to select tno
school candidates for the voters, the
Junior Order having issued a cir
cular from tho pen of William S.
Markolf, a local leader, in which
ho states that the Junior Order will
suporvlse tho work of the different
school boards, and as tho circular
reads "suggest or endorse suitable
persons to serve as candidates for
the board." Thus with the kind
consent of the few gentlemen who
select the present board aad the
Junior Order patriots the publie will
not have to worry in making their
I choice in the school election.
