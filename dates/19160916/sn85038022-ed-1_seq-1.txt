Reports of the theft of several au
tf. mobile tires were received by New
port police. Under the glaring lights
at Sixth and Monmouth streets four
new tires, from as many automobiles
have been removed within the last few
nights. Superintendent W. P. King of
the Newport schools, with his wlfo
and visitors from Maysville, Ky., park
ed his machine on Sixth street, front
ing a theater, while they attended the
early evening performance. A new
tire and rim, costing $35, was cut from
the rear of the car and carried away.
Three similar robberies were prev
iously reported. This is probably the
most brilliantly lighted corner In the
city.

The following is a statement by
Mrs. Cora l'eddlcord, Superintended
of the City Mission, with regard to the
work being done by that organlza
tion:
The dally work In a charity organ!
letlon office, to be well done, de
mands in intelligence that shall not
slumber an earnestness that shall
not tire, a patience not to be over
come, a sympathy that will not suffer
Itself to be chilled.
And none know better than those
of us who have attempted the work
how miserably easy it is In these re
spects to fall.
It seems that a few of our citizens
have the mistaken idea that all fam
illes visited by the Superintendent of
the City Mission are receiving mater
ial aid. They seem to lose sight of
the large scope of our work. Some
days we call on from ten to fifteen
families simply as a friend and no
material aid will be given. The City
Mission gives relief when absolutely
necessary, but It cares less for re
lief than for cure and far less tor
cure, than for prevention. Nothing in
all this relief work, beautiful as it
i at times so Ores our imagination
or seems to us so valuable as the
preventive work which strikes at th
causes jf poverty.
Our friends will admit that pauper
ism is contagious, that easy aid kills
character, and modern charity is laid
on constructive relief but, it places
more accent upon the spiritual side
Faults of character are largely the
cause, of poverty, but, in a charity
society there Is no such a thing as an
unworthy family, though some can
not be helped wisely by material aid
when dealing with old age, little chil
dren and sickness, the word unworthy
la uncharitable indeed.
We ask the help and cooperation of
the public in helping us solve the
many problems which confront us
each day, and ajso, kindly call at the
City Mission and learn just what the
material aid is if any that is given
any one family you may be interest!'.?
in before criticisms are made.
A social worker has problems daily
that would tax the wisdom of Solomon,
and the patience of Job.

Washington, September Id yn spite
of the activity displayed by. Secretary
of the Navy Daniels and the members
of the General board, who on yester
day concluded the hearings on a sits
for a fJovernment armor plnnt, the
opinion Is gaining ground that no such
plant may be erected at all. One of
the first acts of a Republican Congress
probably would be to repeal the armor
plant provision of the law, and the Ad
ministration shows no disposition to
forestall this action by immediately
putting the terms of the bill Into ef
fect. The rivalry among American
cities to furnish the site have proven
so miens.' as to be politically embar
rassing, and already the Bemi-official
suggestion has been advanced that un
der no circumstances will the selec
tion be made before the November
elections. According to the beBt In
formation available, the Ueneral
hoard's predilection Is said to be for
a site on the Great Lakes, where coal,
Iron, gas and water and rail transpor
tation are easily available.

j Many women prefer them for hard service to silk covers

STOCKINGS THAT WEAR!
No one puts a stocking more to test than does a growing child. He likes to get J
down on. his knees and play marbles, he is continually falling and trying his best to
wear out his stockings, but he meets a difficult task when he strikes a BLACK CAT hose.
These stockings will stand out under the strain longer than all others. If you do not
believe it, try a pair. THEY SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.
