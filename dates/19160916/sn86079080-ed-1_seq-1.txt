Result In District Election
Ivuarde and Fleury Levelacv
beat Far Behind ia Narre
Parishes:
The Democratic primary in the
28th judicial district, comprising
Jefferson, St. Charles and St.
John parishes Tuesday resulted in
the usual triumph for the regul
are.
Judge Prentice E. Edrington,
of Reserve, the independent
candidate for judgeship made a
bold fight and lost out by a hand
some vote.
The three parishes cast a large
vote and former State Senator
Robert Rivarde led the field
with Judge Fleury -a good second
Judge Edrington had centered
his fire on Fleury and asked his
friends to.vote for him and Ri
varde. This accounts for Rivarde
prJling the largest vote.
The city of Gretna where Ed
rington was expected to receive
his largest vote in Jefferson due
to the support of Dr. Charles
Gelbke andother reform leaders,
wentheavily for Rivarde and
Fleury. Edrington received 216
vots in Gretna and Rivarde 641
and Ffeury 837.
Judge Rivarde was a member
of the state senate in the last
eUilonof the general' assembly
He lives at Hahnville.
