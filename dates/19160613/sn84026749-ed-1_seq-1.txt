CAMPAIGN
FOR HUGHES
Republican National Committee
Arranges to Show Pictures
of Candidate in Every State.
MAKING CAMPAIGN PLANS
Senator Crane Confers With
Standard Bearer on Offen
sive Against Democrats.
NEW YORK, Juno 13. Charles
Evans Hughe3, whiskers, smile and
all, is to look every American
square in the eye and provo to
each that ho to not an iceberg.
The movies will bo tho medium.
It became known at the candidate's
headquarters In tho Astor Hotel to
day that tho national committee is
already making arrangements to
hove pictures of Hughes shown in
practically every house In tho
United States.
It is held that this will dispel the
impression that Hughes is a
"thinking machine," rather than a
"regular fellow."
CRANE TO CONFER.
Plans for tho major offensive of
Charlet Bvana Hughes. Republican
Presidential candidate. Into the
enemy's country will probably be
made today when W. Murray
r.mn. one of tho Republican "big
three," rambles Into Hughes' red-tap-cstrled
recolvlng-room for "a little talk. '
Whether Murray will be accompanied
by others of the powers -was not known
today. It Is expected, however, that
.others may delay their visit until time
for formal notification of Hughes that
he has been selected Republican stand--axd-benrer.
This will occur sometime
btore next Tuesday. On that day ho
will bo to Brown University, at Provl
vldenoe, to attend the thirty-fifth re
union of his class.
Crane Working Quietly.
Just what Crane has In mind In the
way of a campaign Is not known. He
Is still pursuing tho tactics of ths
Chicago convention working quietly
Roosevelt calls It "pussyfooting."
Hughes will not match In tho pre
paredness parade In Washington to
morrow, being too busy hero. In lieu
of marching he has written WUllam
K. Oude of Washington:
I have the deopest lntorest in this
patriotic movement.''
It is not Justice Hughes, or Gover
nor Hughes these days, but Mr.
Hughes plain Mr. Hughes. The can
didate has let his nroferenco for the
laymen title be known and now "Gov
ernor," by which overy New Yorker
uddresaed him yesterday, is used only
ty newcomers. Hughes, expects to
be busy nil day conferring with tho
polltlcsl powers and receiving con
gratulations of personal friends.
Some of the Callers.
J. E. LuU, of Vernon, Tox., came
all the way from home to congratulate
Hughes and tell him that Texas would
be on the right side.
Herbert Parsons, New York, member
of the national committee, assured
Hughes that there Is "nothing to It."
B. C. Bowen, once a member of
Hughes' Sunday school class at the
Fifth Avenue Baptist Church, was a
caller.
A high percentage of the callers are
bearded men.
Slipping Into the crush of porsons
who thronged headquarters today In
stvenuous efforts to get good seats on
the bandwagon was a messenger boy
who brought the candidate forty

'UNDILUTED AMERICANISM
IS HUGHES' SLOGAN
NEW YORK, June 13. "Undiluted Americanism" is to
be the slogan of Charles Evans Hughes in his campaign for the
Presidency.
He coined the phrase today in his talk with the newspa
permen. In his talk he displayed a "pep" and fire almost Roosevelt
ian, bititig off his words sharply. He said:
"I have stated my position very clearly in my telegram of
acceptance to the convention.
"My platform is one of undiluted Americanism
"Anyone who supports me, supports a thorough going, out-and-out
American policy and nothing else.''

SOARING GASOLENE
Fall May Be Looked For, Say
Producers, Before Federal

Tho skyrocket movemont In tho
price of gasolene has been ended.
A fall In tho prke may bo looked for
at any time. The price In Kansas at
the refineries has already fallen from
SI cents to 17Vi cents.
A period of overproduction of crude
oil, which brought about the low price
of gasolene more than a year ago. Is
about to bo experienced again.
These are a few of the statements
that startled the Federal Trade Com
mission at tho second dav of Its hear

and Jobbers and refiners on tho high
prlco of gasolene
The most of the statements along
these lines were made by T. J, James,
secretary of the association of Re
flnors of Kansas and Oklahoma. Most
of tho testimony taken at tho morning
session today, like that of yesterday,
dealt with tho bookkeeping methods
and costs of marketing and manufac
ture. Tho refiners were examined to
day as tho Jobbers had bcon examined
yesterday.
Representatives of most of the Inde
pendent refineries of the United States
were on hand to glvo their vlows. and

ORPET IS HELPED
BY STATE WITNESS
Josephine Davis, Star Witness
for the Prosecution, Alters
Testimony Given Grand Jury.
WAUKEG-AN. 111., June 13. State's
Attorney Ralph J. Dady struggled to
day to make Josephine Davis mend
tho fabric of evidence against Will
Orpot, on trial for Marian Lambert's
murder, which Josephine herself was
considered today to havo torn by un
expected testimony.
As crowds thronged the courtroom,
anxious to see her on tho stand, Dady
sought to show that MIsh Davis,
Marian's closest friend, had been ap
proached by detoctlves for the de
fense and as a result had turned
against the State. Dady had expected
her to bo his principal witness.
All night Dady and his assistants
studied tho transcript of testimony
that Josephine gave late yesterday.
On record, In this transcript wore
theso statements by Josephine:
Marian Lambert seemed unhappy be
fore she met her mysterious death In
Helms' woods.
Marian did not tell Josephine that
prpet gave her tho capsulos that Mar
Ian had a short tlmo before her death.
Josephine lied In hr .nrlv i.m.

LONDON, Juno 13. Tho
prospect of Roumania joining
with tho allies in tho war
against tho central powers is
growing daily with tho adranco
of tho Russian armies Into
Bukowlna, according to reports
in diplomatic circles here.
PETROGRAD, June 13. Hur-
tling westward with seemingly su-j
perhumon vigor, the Russian
armies of General Brusillof are
now hammering their way toward
Lcmbcrg, the Galician capital, in
giant strides.
The demoralized Austrian de
fenders are rolling back before
them.

than one-third of the men in Aus
trian armies on the east front have
been killed, wounded, or taken
prisoners since the giant offensive
started June 4.
120,000 PRISONERS TAKEN.
Approximately 1M.000 men nnd officers
have been Imprisoned to date. In ac
tions such as the Russians nre engaged
tho estimate of tho conservative critics
Is two killed or Injured for every pris
oner. This would mean that a total of
360.0AO Austrlnns have been put out of
tho fighting slnco Juno 4.
The Austrian nrmy on tho east front
has been variously estimated at from
700.000 to 1.0O0.000 men.

drives the Austrlans back and at the

official reports are that Ctcrnowltz has
already been taken. This has not been
confirmed.
Austrlans Abandon Guns.

advanco of the Russian armies In tho
region of Lutsk that tho Austrlans In
several Instances did not even havo

Ills action was based on Colby's re

Morgenthau's Boost for Secre-'
tory of War Baker Proves To
Be Short-Lived.
NOT BACKED BY PRESIDENT
Senator Taggart Learns From
White House Executive Is for
Old Ticket.
By JUDSON C. WELLTVER.
ST. LOUIS, June 13. It will bo
the old ticket, Wilson and Mar
shall. This may be accepted as
settled in spite of diversity of
booms for the Vice L residency.
For a few fleeting hours a dis
turbance was caused by reports
that Secretary of War Newton D.
Baker was to be the man. Henry
Morgenthau, of New York, former
ambassador to Turkey, gave out a
statement in which he said party
leaders seemed to favor Baker.
Many jumped, to the conclusion
that the nomination of Baker had
the approval of the White House.
TAGGART ASSURED.
Thomas Taggart of Indiana, however,
with the Interest of tho Vice President at
heart, proceeded to call up the White
Houso by phone. He was advised thoro
was nothing to the Raker story and
that tho President vtas for the old
ticket
Not only that but Secretary Baker
wired a lrlcnd here that he was not a.
cnmdldate and Marshall was tho Ad-y
.Ii.lliohi ..nun a accwfcivj.,
It appeared plain that Mr. Morgen
thau spoke without authority, and was
cither acting with the knowledge of
the President or was putting out a
feeler.
Those on the Iraldo know well thoro
has been opposition to Marshall In
high Administration quarters for
months. That the President and his
advisers would have teen glad to toe
some one else named has been no
secret.
' Has Been Independent.
Tho fact Is, Vice President Marshall
has been falrlv Independent, nnd as
presiding, officer of the Senate, has
applied the rules as he believed they
should bo conitrued and not as some
times best calculated to force through
Administration legislation. This Is one
reason why he Is not viewed with or
dent favor at the White House.
Lbst tall, when he made his first oall
on the President at the close of tho
vacation season he found the cold ab
sence of any sign that he was wanted
for Vice President for another term.
In various ways. It has cropped out
there were efforts on foot to unhorsa
Marshall. However, tho Democrats
need Indiana. Fairbanks has been
named by the Republican"!. Two Sen
atoi ships aro at stake. And It Is per
fectly plain that Vice President
Marshall has so manv friends who
would rnlso tho roof if he were not
icnomliiated that the plans to defeat
him will be dropped, barring most un
unexnected developments. The Roger
Sullivan boom, the Governor Major
boom, and others will not mnterlauss.
Friday Without
Terror for Wilson
President Won't Decline Renomi
nation Because of Day on Which -It
Is Scheduled.
The fact that the program of tho
Democratic convention at St. Louis calls
for tho rcnomlnatlon of President Wll-,
oon on a Friday has no terrors for'
President Wilson or tho unterrlfled
Democrocy behind him.
Ofrlclals of the Administration de
clare that the selection of Friday was
purely an accident, but Just tho same
they claim It will be a lucky accident.
"Friday," said Secretary Tumulty to
day "Is our lucky day."
Friends of the President have long
contended that thirteen Is tho Presi
dent's lucky number, and for that rea
son many of them would have liked to
seo his rcnomlnatlon scheduled for to
day. SULLIVAN NOT ASKING
