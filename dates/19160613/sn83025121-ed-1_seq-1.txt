Alarmed By Growing Anti-American
Sentiment and Fear At
tacks Against General Pershing
(iliMciaixl Prt bj Vdrsl Wlnltu.)
WASUINOTON, une 13. That
the rising tide anti-American
nciitimuLt la Mexico hai become
really alarming, and may at any mo
ment precipitate a. cruia between the
two eountriea, ia frankly admitted by
tlie gnverumeut offielala in the state
c'.rpnrtaient and' department of justice,
bpj last nigbt there was manifest a
lnurked feeling of alarm in all govern
mfht circles. '
Tl st t lie administration is alive to
the gravity of the border situation was
shown last night when Heeretary of
War Baker, after a long conference
with Prexident Wilson, issued formal
orders directing 1S00 additional men to
report to (Jeiieral Funstoa- for doty as
border guards. The patrols now on duty

tively protect th smaller to wnk. and
lmuaieu rnncnes irum; rawang parties
belonging lo the two wafting factions,
and every effort is to b itade by the
department to close the gaps in the
line as much aa possible, and ti firm-'
ish protection wherever it is needed.
The Situation DangeroM

received by the war.'state and judicial
departments,, all of which bad secret

from the. tonsulMr ofllrisja throughout
the eouutry tno Mi.ucue that sudden
flare up uty tome at uuy.time.
A preeoncerte i,.4ol taost carefully
nmpiied nut -propugand against the
1 nited Htntes is now well under way,
apparently with the eonaent of the de
lucto. government, wblcl at the very
least is cloning its eyes to the publica
tions attacking this country, and the
orguuizufion of antl-American demou
KtnitioiiM in all of the larger cities.
Just w but uffect tbla propaganda
may have upon the situation south of
the line none of the departmental offi
cials will venture to predict, but sev
eral of Hi c in admitted Inat night that
there is grave danger that the constant
stirring up of the hatred of ie aver

lines of communication that connect

Yesterday 'a parade " and eercJnenies
around the statue, under the aiispices
of the Kamehameha Day committee,
would compare favorably with any
spectacle staged under tho nspincs of
the elaborate organixatloa of Mid I'n
ciflc Carnival committees. .. ,i
I'ntil a few years ago, tbe observ
ance of the birthday of the Huwaiien
"Nnpoleon" waa little more than a
legal holiday on which sport were en
joyed. There was always a more or
less perfunctory decoration by 11a
wuiinns of the big Statue.
Pageant Added To Features:
Then a sierial Kamehameha Day
committee, headed by Edgar Henriquea
took the mutter up and arranged for a
pageant, and a real decoration, with
appropriate ceremonies, and from this
has grown the splendid parade which
charmed nn enormous crowd' at the
judiciary uud uupitot building grounds
yesterday.
The brilliancy of the color of the
contumes of the members of the various
Hawaiian societies waa -especially strik
ing to MKitora, aa well aa old-timers.
In this rcHMct it probably excelled
iniiNt if not nil of the floral parades
held here. Hundreds of picture were
taken, by tourists and others, with all
suits of cameras, and there were sev
eral moving picture outfit at work dur
ig the marching, speech-making and
singing. No camera could give any idea
of the sturtlingly brilliant coloring
that made the scene so striking. Home

will show the. glaring splendor of the
costumes bright yellow and crimson
predominating which are conspicuous
in this unique Hawaiian celebration.
Many In Oreat Parade
The pnruue, under the direction of
former Police Capt. Sobert W. Parker,
started promptly at the announced
time, eight thirty o'clock yesterdsy
morning, und marched along King
street to the Judiciary Building. A
platoon of police led, and tben came
the Hawaiian band, the Boy Seouta,
delegates from other islands and 'the
members of a down or more Hawaiian
ski let ics ot men and women. Mime of
the men s societies were conspicuous
with the bright yellow cloak that were
once om by Hawaiian nobility, and
others with almost equally bright ted.
The women nearly all wore black
dresses, with various decoration. Many
of the woineu were quite elderly, but
they kept up well ia the not short
march from Aala Park to the square
uherethe statue of Kamehameha atanda.
And they stood throughout the cere
iii. mil l., and joined in the singing.
Mayor John C. Lane, wearing one of
the yellow cloaks, was a very conspicu
ous figure lending the Hawaiian socie
ties. The mayor was chairman of the
executive committee which arranged
the celebration, and after arrival at the
judiciuiy building assisted ia the direc
tum of the pugvailt.
