St. Louis, June 13. Delegates to

to the consideration of the new na
tional committee chairman and those
aiding in directing the campaign.
Senator Saulsbury of Delaware, H. H.
Cummins of Connecticut and Colonel
House are being considered. Presi
dent Wilson has indicated that any of
these would suit him. Wilbur W.
Marsh-of Iowa, will very likely be the
choice for treasurer, and Henry Mor-

nance committee. The committee
meets Saturday.
The prospects for a fight over the
vice presidential position are diminish
ing as the incoming delegations are
lined up behind Marshall. V
Win. J. Bryan may present the

to solicit progressive support with
the insertion of progressive planks in
the platform. One leader said today
that some sort of suffrage plank
would likely be in the platform.

FLORIDA, TUESDAY,
MARION HEEDS TO BOND III ORDER TO TAKE HER
PROPER PLAGE III THE GOOD ROADS MOVEMENT
With the county campaign ended,
and the atmosphere cleared of poli
tics, the next movement of magnitude
in Marion county will be1 toward an
issue of bonds for the purpose of con
structing permanent roads, roads that
will make for economy; and that will
put Marion in line with such counties
ac Polk, Lake, Pinellas and Hills
borough, in the matter of modern
highways.
Mr. T. T. Munroe, who . took so
much interest in the recent tour of
inspection over the sand-asphalt
highways of Lake county, was asked
this morning about the proposed bond
issue. He is .confident that the issue
will Scarry ' in this county if it is
brought to a vote, and he is in favor
o, meetings in the various sections o
the county, to be held for the purpose
of outlining just what the bond isrue
will accomplish, just how it iff to be
handled, and in order that any and
all questions pertaining to the issue
might be fully discussed :and answer
ed. -: . I ;;
In addition to the 200 miles of per
manent highways to be built in Polk
county as a result of the recent voting
of an issue of bonds to the amount of
?1,500,000, that county has received,
and will continue to receive, an in
valuable amount of free advertising.
Newspapers and magazines the coun
try over have given news and editor
ial space to the Polk county project.
Polk's action has been held up as an
example to the nation.
All who went from this county to
inspect the sand-asphalt highways of
Lake county, and saw those highways
being constructed, came back highly
enthusiastic, and it was agreed that
Marion would have to act quickly in
order not to remain behind in the
march of progress. A bond issue was
said at the time to be the proper
thing. Action was delayed on this
until after the political campaign,
and this campaign is now over.
IMPORTANT MEETING
TOMORROW EVENING
A. C. L. Officials and Councilmen Will
Discuss -Pending Ordinances
The judiciary committee of the city
council meets tomorrow night at 8
o'clock at the city hall to consider the
Nash ordinances to require the rail
roads to "place gates at all. of the
street crossings in the. city. J. C.
Murchison, division superintendent of
the Atlantic Coast Line,.is expected to
appear before the. committee,' he hav
ing recently made a request to do so.
Mr. Murchison stated when he was in
Ocala last week that he wanted the
city and his road to get together on
the various problems that confront
both, and it is probable that the
meeting tomorrow night will prove to
be an entering wedge to a better un
derstanding betwen the city and the
Coast Line.

ing fire. Their . little daughter was
in the bed asleep at the time, but the
thoughtfulness of Mrs. Kichline saved

MAXWELL RECORD IN
A PACIFIC COAST RUi
Recent motor car performances in
the west have focused the attention
of 'the automobile public on Maxwell
cars. During the month of May, stock
Maxwell cars have been put through
various paces along the Pacific coast
and in every instance have establish
ed records that proclaim dependabil
ity, strength and the all-important
item of economy. . 1
Ray McNamara, who has piloted
several Maxwell economy runs, and
who established a record in Detroit
early in April when he drove a stock
touring car forty-four miles on a gal
lon of gasoline, broke his own record
in California, when he drove a car
from Oakland to San Jose, the speed
ometer showing 45.6 miles when the
engine stopped after consuming its
supply of one gallon of gasoline.
In connection with McNamara 's
performance, a report comes from
Seattle that a Maxwell touring car
made the run from Seattle to Tacoma
on a gallon of gasoline. A distance of
forty-three miles was registered and
the car carried five adult passengers
and "two children.
The Lake Tahoe Run
The Maxwell gained added glory by
breaking the trail to Lake Tahoe,
making the run three full weeks be
fore the earliest arrival of any pre
vious season. v -,
This performance is all the more
remarkable in that the snowfall in the

AN UGLY SPOT
IADE ATTRACTIVE
Good Work Done by Chief Chambers
and His Assistants in Their
Fire Station Garden
Few persons in the city, perhaps,
have seen the garden, recently laid
out by Chief Chambers and his men
in the rear of the fire station. It is an
eloquent demonstration of what can
Lj done in the way of making attrac
tive ugly spots. It is evidence of
what can be done with a small expen
diture of money. Labor is the main
thing, and with the chief and his men
it is a labor of love. Roses predomi
nate in the garden back of the sta
tion, and there are now in bloom.
ANOTHER PRETTY PARTY
FOR MISS ATKINSON
(Tampa Tribune)
Miss Annie Atkinson of Ocala, was
the attractive guest of honor yester
day afternoon at a bridge'party, given
by Mrs. Goree Nelson. Most of the
guests were the friends of the hon
oree. The trophies of the-game were
pretty sewing baskets. They wera
given Miss Fannie Robinson for high
score and Miss Atkinson for guest's
prize. Miss Atkinson wil be the hon
oree Wednesday at an informal little
bridge given by Mrs. William H.
Jackson. .
past winter was the heaviest since
j.eoy. me Maxwell made the trip to
California's most famous mountain
lake without any aid save that fur
nished by its own engine and its
hardy crew of four men.
In many places the snow was piled
fifteen feet deep, but the car came
through without being buried once.
The success of the venture was due in
large part to the ability of the car to
ride the heavy drifts instead of break
ing through them, as was the case
witn neavier cars m past seasons.
More Economy Testa .
Mr. McNamara 's latest economy
test was observed by representatives
:fthe Lincoln Highway Association
and the San Diego fair, while the au
tomobile editor of the Oakland, Calif.,
Tribune inspected the speedomether
gears, the carburetor, etc.
Speakingcf the economy test at
Seattle, one of the newspapers there
said:
"Seattle has been the scene of
numerous economy trials, which have
aroused much interest among motor
enthusiasts, but a new chapter was
recorded when a 1916 model Maxwell
touring car, 'carrying five adults and
two children, traveled from Seattle to
Tacoma on a gallon of gasoline." That
the performance was not an accident
was demonstrated when the feat was
repeated on the return trip. The dis
tance from the Seattle Automobile
company's building in Seattle to the
Logan Garage in Tacoma is forty-
three miles, which gives the Maxwell
a record lor phenomenal gasoline,
economy."
