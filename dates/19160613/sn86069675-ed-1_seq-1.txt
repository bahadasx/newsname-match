tSpcnking of opportunities
for
American business men nnd manu
facturers iri tho country where he
was formerly stationed ns tho Am
bassador, of the United States,
Henry Morgcnthnu, in n public ad
dress, declared that while Ameri
can; export business to Turkey was
practically at a standstill now,
theTe was a wonderful chance for
n renewal after the war of a thriv
ingrbusiness begun with the Otto
jaah Empire before the outbreak
of- hostilities. He rmtd that the
Standard Oil Company had estab
lished itself, fighting tho Russian
nnd 'Rumanian interests, the Inter
nationa Harvester Company nnd
American Tobacco Coompany did a
big business and that American
mines can compete with England
and Australia in selling coal. Fur
ther ho declared that very little
land in Turkey was cultivated be
fore the war becauso of bad roads,
and that when pence comes thcro
will be n field thero for tho sale
of agricultural implements. Ameri
cans have nn advantage he assert
ed becauso Turkey .realizes that tho
United States has no desire foi
Oriental territory.
What is true of InrSey will be
true of practically the entire world
when peace comes. It is very evi
dent that there will be more op
portunities for placing tTio products,
of the lands and the outputs of
our mines anil mills, shops and fac
tories in greater quantities' and in
far wider distribution after the war
ends tkntbihere is during its con-,
tinunnce. , There are on the conti
nent of Europe fully 200,000,000
pepple who -arc now oh short ra
tions, and nearly 100,000,000 in
Africa- ant Asia in fliij "same grasp"
of near famine.' Nurtliein, Western
and SbuHiern Europe nliko nre buf
fering severely from the isenrcity
of food, nnd if British nnd French
reports ns.to food conditions in Ger
many and Austria re to be credit
ed, the 120,000,000 of people in
those nations nre very close to ac
tual starvation.
Hi If these 300,000,050 people of tho
old world are free once more to
buy and receive such commodities
from our ports, it will take j'enrs
of shipments in huge amounts to
provide those populations with
stores of food, and for years af
ter the close of tho war the bellig
erent nations will be unable to pro
duce sufficient themselves to ap
proximate in any manner the peo
ple's needs. Village, towns nnd
citias will have, to bo rebulit;
farms, districts, provinces und
kingdoms re-equipped in nil that
makes modern, life what it is, and
tho United States, for materials,
machinery, tools and implements,
will be u great supply house for
the major part of what is needed.
There .is no valid argument that
can justify concern in tho 'minds
of business men of the United
States ns to dull times in this
country after tho close of tho Eu
ropean war, though ns n matter of
political necessity tho Republicans
will be compelled to predict 'em.

CAPT. BECKNER HURT
Capt. Lucien Beckncr, editor of
the Clark County Republican, sus
tained a vcrp painful injury while
working with his cylinder press
one day last week, when his right
hand was caught between the
steel and the composition rollers.
The member was badly hurt, though
no bones were brokon, but the in
jury caused excruciating pain. Mr.
Beckncr, however, is gifted with the
ability of writing with either hand
and the injury he sustained will not
interfere with him in the effort to
get out his paper.
