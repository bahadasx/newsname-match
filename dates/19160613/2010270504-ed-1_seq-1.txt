HATTLK TWELVE INNINGS
WITH A TWO TO TWO SCORE
Thero was a real game down at tho
ball lot yesterday afternoon when
North Platto and Eustls. battled
through twclvo Innings with a two to
two scoro and then called tho gamo
in order that tho visitors might catch
a train home. It was a game that was
full of thrillers; thero was not a mo-i
mont tho strain on tho players as well
as on tho meagre crowd of fans was
not tonse. ATtley -and Tibbotts wero
tho twlrlors. Each struck out thir
teen men; Artloy gavo seven hits and
Tibbetts eight, honors were thorcforc
nearly oven.
EustlB scored ono in tho third and
one In the eighth frame; North Platto
ono In tho sixth and ono lri the eighth.
After tho eighth Eustls got ttwo men
on bases, but Artloy tightened up and
thero they remained as though glued.
In tho .'twelfth framo North Platte got
a man ran first, and Gettman lined out
a hot one over second that looked like
a two-bagger and a yell arose, but it
was short lived for Carrlg, Who covors
all the ground In tho outfield, was
Johnnie on tho spot and snapped It
and then tho Eustls crowd made a
run for tho train.
The paid admissions wero a little
short of a hundred, and when the re
sult of tho game was known 784 fans
kicked themselves because they did
not throw business to the winds and
attend.
