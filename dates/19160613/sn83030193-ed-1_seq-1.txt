PETUOOKA June 13. One thou
and more Ausv ans have boon taken
prisoners and their compatriots are
retreating rapidly along the entlro
front, according to an oinclal an
nouncement by the I'etroerJd War
Office to.night.
War Department oftlclals per
mit the statement to be published,
under a, Bucharest, Itoumanla, date
Jlne that Czernuvvitz, capital of Huko
wlna, has been taken by CJen. Urusl
loff. The Austrian army defending
the fortress, which already haa
changed hands eight times In this
war, .ias fallen back to a position
four miles to the west, whero It Is
being savaRfly attacked by tho
Slavs.
Half of the entire Austr -Oerman
nrmy on a 300-mllo front has been
wiped out. according ti messages
from on r-spondenls at tho front.
The ltusslans have taken 113.000
prisoners.
"At tho modett reckoning of only
two killed and wounded to every
prisoner taken, the Austto-Germnns
have lost more than half their fighting
strength in one week of fighting," ona
correspondent wires,
This would mean that the Teutons
havt lost 230,000 kiled and wounded.
These, in addition to the prisoners
taken would make their losses 340.000
effectives and would indicate that the
Teutonic armies facing Gen. Brui
lloff had 690,000 rifles in the fighting
line, besides many thousands of men
in the services of supply, communiea.
tlon and transport probably 1,000,000
men In all.
Practical confirmation of the. cap
ture of tho capital of the Austrian
Crownland of Hukuwlnu Is Riven by
the official anil uincument of the cap
turo of Dobronovtze, a commanding
point ten miles to tho northwest, and
by the fact that when tho Russian
troops ontered the outskirts uf Czurn
owltz in hand-to-hand fighting groat
explosions, caused by tho Austrlaus
blowing up their supplioa boforo flee

Czernowltz, and, according to mili
tary authorities, thoy are tho only

defense. Slnco tho Russians have
taken both, llttlo doubt Is folt that
tho capital has fallen.
The Roumanlnn mcssagos say tho
Czar's wonderful drive of tho paat
week, with tho capture of Czeruo
witz, Is having grout offoct through
out Rotlmanls., whero thero Is a con

theory.
"Marian was frequently depressed

"On the Sundav afternoon of her
clghtcinth birthday party she had a

"Jo, oh, .In! 1 cannot bo happy,
knowing my piesent condition.'
' Then she told me she Intended to
kill herself If Will married Celesta
Walker.
"I 'kidded' her about the threat,
and asked her If she wanted m to
tell her parents nbnut her relations
with Orpet after she whs dead.
" 'Don't tell my father and mother,'
r-Sio answered 'It would only start
a l"t of gossip '
'Trequently 1 had told Marian that

I told her this she replied In this
manner:
"'If you tell my mother one word

report which Dorothy Mason told us
about the engagement. If Will Is
engaged to marry Celesta Vouker
I'll fix him.' "
I Asked by Josephlno tho meaning of
the threat "I'll tlx him." Miss Davis
