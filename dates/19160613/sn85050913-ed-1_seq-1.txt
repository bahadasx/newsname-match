That Blalrsburg will soon be in
^ull poasesslon and enjoyment of
electricity for lighting and power
purposes Is evident from the follow
ing in the Blalrsburg Enterprise:
Representatives of the Iowa Falls
'Electric Co. were, in Blalrsburg re
cently Interviewing our city officials
and business men with a view to ex
tending their lines here. The com
pany has purchased the plant at Wil
liams of 'F. B. Payne and will be
ready to furnish light and power
there Oct 1st. With little more ex
pense they can extend the wires here
ajid thus give us an opportunity to
have electric light without one cent
of outlay except tor the current used,
The company asks for nothing but
a franchise in/ BUirsburg. ^They of

is to grant them A right-of-way over

There Is little doubt that Blalrs

Is much livelihood of ou,r council tak

A Heeded Vacation.
Alex. Bossert, who has been em
ployed in the Chas. T. Smith St Son
Clothing stcfe for Uie tast eight
years, has resigned his position in
that establishment to take a much
needed vacation and rest. Mr. Bos
sert has probably served the public
as a clerk as long or longer than any
other man In the city, having been
employed in that capacity for the
past thirty years or more. At pres
ent he is putting in the time garden

up Into'the air when, as the gun was
fired for the last lap, Porter Was six

ly he passed one after tho other of
these and made the goal in a won
derful burst of speed which was one
of the most spectacular things of the
day! The audicnc^ went wild with
enthusiasm. Thfe beautiful big .sil

him is today on display in the Op

the Webster City high school are

Greenwood last year won fifth
place in discus throw and Saturday
brought his record up to third place.
First place in the United State* is
still Meld by Gilman of lirbana, 111.,
who has held ttie place ior a few
years. TJhs fact, however, that
Greenwood brought his previous rec
ord up,.Is presaging enough for fut^
ure work in that line. Greenwood
will hold, first place in the United
States in another year or two, is tho
opinion of those #ho know the qual
ity of his athletic work. His silver

tied Condition of Water
W
,)'
At a meeting of the park commis
sion Friday, night, it was decided
that on account of the unsettled
condition of the water in Boone riv
er, which for the past two years has
during the summer months been in a
muddy and turbid condition due to
frequent rains a permanent swim
ming tank- will be erected in Noko'
mis park for the usfe of all who de
sire.
Expcriencod -swimmers may use
the strong current of the river for a
swimming' pool but women or chil
dren. are in- danger in the waters of
the river when Tt remains so high.
For this purpose the park commis
sion, with the need of the public at
heart, has dcclded upon the above
course. V. 4||
The low swale exTstfng In the park
just north of the middle section has
been selected for th? location of the
tank, which will be of cement
construction with bottom' cover
ed with sand.- As the work
proceeds it will readily be ascertain
ed whether or not clay may be struck
during the excavation, for if the
commission fe 30 fortunate as to find
clay, this will be used instead of
concrete as a foundation of the pool,
with sand on the bottom.
Tho dimensions of .the swimming
tank will lo about 60 feet by 150 in
length with the depth varying from
1 foot to 8 feet. It is the plan to
have running water through the
tan&, furnished either from the riv
er, or by a pumping system. Work
will begin at once, or just as soon as
men and teams can be secured for the
work of 'excavation.
A swimming pool has been needed
in the'eity for a long time. Young
boys will swim and the uncertain
current of the river, which has been
high for so long a time, has made
swimming for young boys a danger
ous pastime. These proceedings will
in no wise change the plans for a
dam-abross the river, which will al
so make a good boating point, as
well as an excellent place for aquatic

Clarence Hurd, appraisal engineer
for the Farmers & .Merchants Tele
phone Company, wlio has been work
ing in Blalrsburg, Williams, Jewell
and this city for the past few
months, left Saturday a. m. in the
company's Ford runabout for Fort
Bodge on a business trip. When
about five miles west of Duncombe
he evidently struck a rut in the road
and was probably driving too fast to
stand the sudden shock, for the car
left the road and turned over two or
three times.
Mr. Hurd was evidently thrown
from the car after the first turn ov
er for found himself lying at somfe
little distance from the machine. It
has not been ascertained just how
badly he is injured, but he was
struck by the steering wheel in the
lower ribs and fears that several
ribs may be dislocated or broken. He
was able to go to a telephone and
call for assistance and R'. L. Sterling,
local manager for the company, was
notified and left at' once for the
scene. He found Mr. Hurd able to
walk and saw him safely off on the
train for Storm Lake which1 was his
final destination..
Mr. Hurd refused to be examined
by the Duncombe physician, saying
that he knew he was not seriously
injured.
Mr. Sterling had some of the car's
damages repaired and he returned to
this'city in it Saturday p. m. One
of the front wheels was broken, the
wind shield smashed, steering wheel
bent and other damages will be re
paired later,

OVE* WORLD.
TRAVELLED ALL
mm
Found on Island of Mauritius Daring
Fearful Yellow Fever
ft
A strange and unusual Crusadef
of Christ arrived on foot In the city
on Saturday from tbe east, having
travelled in this manner all over the
earth, claiming up to date the great
umber of 112,202 miles. His name
as strange as his pilgrimage—
Rev. Harrabellio Aleckamousa Mar
angeopa—and his home is—tbe
world. From here he will continue
his pilgrimage west.
5
Rev. Marangeopa is a Malay1 mis
sionary who has chosen this unique
method as the best way for the
spreading of the gospel throughout
the world. A Malay by birth, Euro
peanized by education, this mission
ary is by reason of his travels as cos
mopolitan as one of his calling
should be. j-
He has taken literally the mean
ing of the words, "Go ye therefore
into all the earth, preaching the gos
pel to every people," and with the
Scriptural injunction as his slogan,
he has obeyed.
Possibly few who bear the honored
title of "missionary" are better
equipped than this man, who has a
speaking knowledge of twenty-seven
different languages and dialects,
with the exception of Russian, rep
resenting the tongues of lands he has"
visited.. The Russian language, he
admits, was too much for him.
Fatherless, motherless, nameless,
he was found by the Sisters of Mercy
on the west side of the Island, Maur
itius, in 1871, the year of the tear
ful plague of yellow fever upon
this island. Then an infant he was
found wailing among the dead bodies
of fourteen of his relatives who had
undoubtedly succumbed, to swift
death by the fever. One month lat
er he was taken to Manchester, Eng
land, by Hon. Joseph E. Widger, who
saw to it that the small orphan boy
at the proper age was put through
the public schools of that city, laler
finishing the four year's conrse in
theology in Holme College and grad
uated with divinity honors. N!
