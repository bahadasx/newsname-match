Wednesday
St Louis, June 12. Party leaders
and delegates to the Democratic na
tional convention, which meets here
this week, are arriving on every train.
Thousands of visitors also are arriv
ing and the hotels are filling up rap
idly. An enormous attendance is an
ticipated. While the mntter ot nominating a
candidate for president will lie in the
mere formality of placing President
Wilson before the delegates, the mat
ter of the platform is engaging the
oerlousconsideratlon of the arriving
leaders. The big struggles are ex
pected to be over the preparedness,
prohibition and suffrage planks. Wil
liam J. Bryan and Eugene N. Foss,
formerly governor of Massachusetts,
are expected to Join In trying to in
duce their friends 'to have an abso
lute prohibition plank incorporated in
the platform.
The convention will be called to or

al Chairman William P. McCombs.

til Thursday noon, after which time
Senator James of Kentucky will take
the gavel as permanent chairman, de
liver an address and receive the re
ports of the permauent committees,
the platform being the most import
ant work. It will be reported and
read by Senator William J. Stone ot
Missouri.
Wilson's Renomlnatlon.
Adjournment will then be taken un
Ul Friday noon and the afternoon of
Juno 16 will be devoted to Mr. AVest
cott's speech renaming President Wil
son. The leaders on the ground be
lieve that tho president will he re
nominated on Friday evening and
that Vice President Marshall will be
renominated Friday night some time
before midnight.
There is a disposition on' the part
of the national committeemen and
delegates to resent a remark fre
quently heard to the effect that so far
as the platform Is concerned the book
is closed, it Is admitted that Presi
dent Wilson will "suggest" tho idea
of most of the planks, but it is main
tained that his frequent conferences,

with members of the cabinet Is an

nrdent indication of his Intention not
to dictate what shall be done here.
When the plntform is ready for the
convention It is expected that'll will
represent an expansion of that adopt
ed by the Missouri Democratic con
vention. That particular pjatform was
written by National Chairman Wll
IWm F. McCombs, It was learned, and
it is agreed that when the president
and Senator Stone have brought to
bear on it their intimate knowledge
of the matters with which it deals the
finished document will give the coun
try not only a competent review of
what has been accomplished by the
party, but also some indications of
the motives that have actuated the
president and ills advisers in adopt
ing certain policies.
The Mexican problem.
This will be particularly trne. It Is
asserted, in the case of the Mexican
problem. It was pointed out by one
who is in the oonfldence of the presi
dent that he has designedly refrained
from telling the country why he did
certain things, or did not do certain
things, In Mexico, and the Informa
tion was vouchsafed that when the
president did speak, either through
t""e platform or on some later occa
sion, his justification of his Mexican
policy would answer completely the
charge that his Mexican policy has
been a failure.
So far as the issue of Americanism
is concerned, one hears in St. Louis
little more than the assertion that
the Republican party has no monop
oly of patriotism, and that the Demo
cratic document will go Just as far as
its expression of loyalty to the funda
mental traditions of this country as
that of the Republican party does.
There is much more interest dis
played as to what will take place In
the national committee after the nom
inations are made. Chairman William
F. McCombs is anxious to retire. The
committeemen want to name one of
their company Homer Cummins of
Connecticut for chairman. There
continues to be talk, however, of Col
onel Edward M. House, the presl
dent's advisers.
The program is to renominate Vice
President Marshall, but there are sev
eral persons who want the honor.
Missouri has a candidate in Governor
Major. Nebraska offers Governor
Moorehead. Roger Sullivan of Illi
nois insists that he is not joking in
putting up his name, and Senator
Owen of Oklahoma would not refute
a renomlnation. The far west seeks
recognition.

Nation In Serious Position, Eco

KING VICTOR HASTENS TO ROME
Present Form of Government, In Opin

With Overthrow Resignation of
Cabinet Follows Developments at
Home and at the Front Austrian
Offensive the Last Straw,
Rome, June 12. The Italian cabi
net, headed by Premier Salandra. hav
ing failed to obtain a vote of confi
dence from parliament, has resigned.
The vote was 193 to 141.
King Victor Emmanel is hurrying
here from the front responding to an
urgent call from his most trusted ad
vlsers who feel that the monarch's
presence Is imperative.
The resignation of the cabinet Is
the culmination of a chain of develop
ments which have been brewing un
der the surface, carefully concealed by
the governing powers and which,
about to be brought to the surface,
threaten to plunge Italy into the grav
est crisis since the outbreak of the
war. Military, financially and eco
nomically the country Is today In a
position so serious that even consent
ative ol -vers express the fear that
the pr. nt form of government,
threatened with overthrow Just before
IUdv entered into the war, will not
sun-Ire. To the military, financia.
and economic plight threatens to be
added domestic political upheaval,
making impossible Italy's continuance
as a belligerent. The Socialist and
peace parties have been growing tre
mendously since the Austrian offen
sive began, and also the movement
for a radical reconstruction of the
whole government.
Cabinet In Disrepute.
With the Salandra cabinet, which
has Just resigned, the country has
been thoroughly disgusted for months.
Only the ever-repeated appeal to the
patriotism of the people not to let In
ternal strife spoil Italy's campaign,
and the influence and power Salandra
managed to maintain In parliament,
postponed time and time again the
event that has Just come to pass.
The constantly growing satisfaction
was given Irresistible impetus by the
successful Austrian offensive on the
Trentino, which gave the lie to the
confident assurances of statesmen
and pro-government newspapers that
the Italian front could never be brok
en; that, on the contrary, the Austro
Hungarian armies were face to face
with Inevitable defeat.
General Cadorna, the Italian com
mander In chief, has changed from
the people's idol into a subject ot bit
ter criticism.
The predominant note voiced by the
Italian newspapers is that Italy made
a grave mistake in believing the war
would be, for her, a short one. The
country was not prepared for a war
lasting longer than six months at the
outside.

DEPARTS FOR
NEW YORK
Former Associate Justice
Hughes Goes To Metropolis
Presidential Nominee May Hold
k. Important Conferences.
ACCOMPANIED BY SECRETARY
Intimated That a Meeting Between
Hughes and Colonel Roosevelt It In
Prospect Many Problems to En
gage the Attention of the Nominee.
Flood of Congratulatory Messages,
Received at His Home.
Washington, June 12. Former As
sociate Jubtlco Charles E. Hughes
left today for Xew York.
Concerning the purpose of his trip
nnd the length of his stay in Xew
Tork no information was forthcom
ing at the Hughes home. He is ac
companied by his secretary, Lawrence
Green.
The announcement, which wa3
made there by Justice Hughes or his
secretary, immediately gave rise to
many surmises, In view of the fact
that the thought of harmonizing tne
hitherto discordant elements of the
Republican party is uppermost In tao
minds of many leaders.
To this wish Justice Hushes him
self gave expression in his message
of acceptance to Chairman Harding
of the Republican convention. "I sin
cerely trust," he said, "that all for
mer differences may be forgotten and
that we may have united effort in a
patriotic realization of our national
need and opportunity."
The circumstances under which Mr.
Hughes make his hurried trip to New
York and thereport that George V".
Wickersham. former attorney gen
eral, after conferring with the Repub
lican nominee last week, made a hur
ried trip to Oyster Bay, gave rise to
the belief that conferences which
may have an important bearing upon
the campaign may be under contem
plation, if a meeting between Mr.
Hughes and Colonel Roosevelt him
self Is not In prospect.
There are many problems to engage
the attention of Mr. Hughes outside
the healing of the breach that has ex
isted in the Republican 'party. A
chairman of the national? committee
is to be selected. The "methods of
campaign are to be decided upon. His
own household plans for the forth
coming summer are to be worked out.
Flood of Messages.
The flood of messages of congratu-.
latlons seems to be unchecked. They
were so many that it is almost an im
possibility for Justice Hughes to read
them all. Xone of them was given
out for publication.
Mr. Hughes when Informed official
ly Saturday by Chairman Warren G.
Harding that he had been chosen as
the standard bearer of his party, im
mediately tendered "uis resignation as
associate justice of the United Statts
and wired to Chicago an acceptance
of the honor. High spots in his ac
ceptance telegram follow:
"I stand for the firm and unflinch
ing maintenance of all the rights of
American citizens on land and sea.
In our foreign relations we have suf
fered incalculably from the weak and
vacillating course which has been tak
en with regard to Mexico. At the
outset of the administration we pre
sented to the world a humiliating
spectacle of inaptitude. I stand for
an Americanism that knows no ul
terior purpose; for a patriotism that
is single and complete. Whether na
tive or naturalized, of whatever race
or creed, we have hut one country,
and we do not for an instant tolerate
any division of allegiance. I believe
In preparedness. We must have the
strength which self-respect demands
the strength of an efficient nation
ready for every emergency. Our prep
aration must be industrial and eco
nomic, as well as military. We must
have a fair and wise readjustment of
the tariff. We must conserve the just
interests of labor. We must be zeal
ous to assure the foundations ot hon
est business. We must not throttle
American industry here or abroad "
