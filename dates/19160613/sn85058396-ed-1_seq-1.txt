GIRL REPUDIATES
HER TESTIMONY
Creates Sensation at Orpet
Trial by Stating That She
Had Testified Falsely.
Waukegan, Ills., June 13. Jo
sephine Davis testified today that
Marion Lambert, for the alleged mur
der of whom Will H. Orpet Is on trial
here, threatened to commit suicide If
It proved true that Orpet had trans
ferred hlB affections to another.
The school girl witness, called by
the state, continued to testify for the'
defense. She completely repudiated
previous stories of the cheerfulness of
Marlon, her chum, and told of spells
of depression over fear that she was
In a delicate condition and later,
when this fear became loss acute,
after January 20, over the reported
defection of Orpet. ,
It was Dorothy Mason who told'
Marlon that Orpet, a student at the
University of Wisconsin, was engaged
to marry Celeste Youker, according to
the witness.
" T wonder why she told me that?'
Marion said to me," related Miss Da
vis. " 'Maybo It waB JviBt to make me
fool bad.'"
"So we framed up a letter to Or
pet, but aB no reply was received
Marlon began to think that Miss Ma
son had told the truth. It was on
February 6 when Marion had her
eighteenth birthday party that she
threatened to kill herself.
" 'Honest, if Billie has thrown me
over, I'll Tdll myself,' she told me."
"I laughed at her just to try to
get her out of the mood and then
she laughed too. I said, 'You won't
let me tell everything to your mother
now; shall I tell what I know after
death?' She laughed and said: 'Well
I guess not! There will be gossip
anyway and we might as well give
them something to gOBsip about.' "
Waukegan, Ills., June 13. Josephine
Davis, chum of Marion Lambert, -for
whoso death in February last Will Or
pet is charged with murder and 1b
now being tried, resumed the witness
stand at the continuance (of the trial
today. Counsel for the state renewed
examination of the witness who was
yesterday callod to the stand by at
torneys for the prosecution.
Mlsc Davis, who has been referred
to as "the strongest witness for the
state," provided a distinct sensation
when she proved to be a better wit
ness for the defense than for the
prosecution by stating that she had
testified falsely at the coroner's in
quest over the body and at the hear
ing before the grand jury and that she
now wished to correct her earlier

Miss Davis Cross-Questioned.
"Did you say in a letter that news

of his engagement to Celeste Youker
would prove a blow to Marion after
her illness?" asked Attorney David R.
Joslyn for the state.
"About that, yes" said Miss Davis.
"Who drew up the letter?"
"I did. she approved it."
Witness said that In January at
Marion's suggestion she wrote Orpet,
who was attending the University of
Wisconsin at Madison, asking him to
send his communications for Marion
to her, the witness.
"Are you on friendly terms with the
defendant now" asked Mr. Joslyn.
"I certainly ani not," responded
Miss Davis.
"Didn't you shako hands with him
after court yesterday?"
"Yes, I did."
Mr. Joslyn resumed his pursuit of
discrepancies between the girl's pres
ent testimony and , that before the
grand jury.
"Do you know where Orpet slept
on the night of February S?" asked
Mr. Joslyn.
"I do not."
"Or on the night of February 9?"
"I do not."

Extraordinary Possibilities
Broad Distinction Be

West Point, N. Y June 13. Presi
dent Wilson, making his first address
sinco the presidential campaign be
gan, today discussed preparedness,
militarism, Americanism, the causes
of the war in Europe, peace, the Mon
roe doctrine, divided allegiance and
the ideals of America. He declared
it is the present Impcratlvo duty of
the United States to be prepared add
ing "mankind is going to know that
when America speaks she means
what she says."
General George W. Goethals, gov
ernor of the Panama canal zone, was

Tho president said the United
States should not be a blustering na
tion, a nation "with a chip on its
shoulder" but a calm nation which
will withhold Its hand as long as
possible and strike only for victory.
The president's address ran through
the almost entire list of subjects dis
cussed by former Justice Huglfes in
his telegram accepting the Republican
nomination and he declared that the
United States is cady to join with
other nations to see that the kind of
Jusice it believes in is given.
America First Is Slogan.
Shaking his finger emphatically the
president told the graduates of the
military academy and a large audi
ence that nobody who docs not put
America first can bo tolerated. He
added, however, that time Americans
should get a good example.
The president declared the present
war did not come by accident, but
that it had to come. Tho United
States wants nothing from'Europe, he
said, and there is nothing she wants
which she must get by war. He sound
ed a warning that no man can tell
what the next day will-bring forth In
the world's events.
Tho word "Americanism" was used
today by the president for the first
time in recent addresses. He warned
the graduates against militarism.
The president's speech was fre
quently Interrupted by applause.
Living in Responsible Days.
The text follows:
"I look upon this body of men who
are graduating today with a peculiar
interest. I feel like congratulating
ihem thatthey are living in a day not
only so Interesting, because fraught
with change, but also because so re
sponsible. Days of responsibility are
the only days that count In time, be
cause they are tho only days that
give test of quality. They aro the only
days when manhood and purpose is
tried out as it by firo.
"I need not tell you young gentle
men that you are not like an ordinary
graduating class of one of our uni
versities. The men in those classes
look forward to the life which they
aro to lead after graduation with a
great many questions in their mind.
Most of them do not know exactly
what their lives aro going to develop
Into. Some of them do not know
what occupations they are going to
follow. All of them arc conjecturing
what will bo the line of duty and ad
vancement and the ultimate goal of
success for them.
No Conjecture at West Point.
"There is uo conjecture for you.
You have enlisted in something that
does not stop when you leave the
academy for yon only then to begin
to realize It which then only begins
to be filled with the full richness of
Its meaning and you can look forward
with absolute certainty to the sort of
thing that you will bo obliged to do.
"Thia has always boon true of grad
uating classes at West Point, but the
certainty that some of the older
classes used to looked forward 10 was
a very dull certainty. Some of the
old days In the army I fancy were not
very Interesting days. Some times
men like the present chief of staff,
for example, could fill tholr lives with
tho interest of really knowing and
understanding the Indians of tho west
ern plains, knowing what was going
on insido of their minds and being
able to bo tho intermediary between
them and those who dealt with them
jy speaking tholr sign language,
could enrich their lives, but the ordi
nary life of an ordinary officer at a
western post could not havo been
very exciting and I think with admira
tion of those dull years through
which officers who had not a great
deal to do Insisted, nevertheless up
on being effioient and worth while
and keeping their men fit at any time
for the duty to which they 'were as
signed. Extraordinary Possibilities Ahead.
"But In your case there are many
extraordinary possibilities, because,
gentlemen, no man can certainly tell
you what the Immediate future 16 go
ing to be either in the history of this
country, or In the history of the
world. It Is not by accident that tho
present great war came in Europe.
Every olement was thwe and the con
test had to come, sooner or later, and
It is not going to be by accident that
the results are worked out, but by
purpose by he purpose of tho men
who are strong to have guiding minds
and indomltablo wills when the time
for decision and settlement come.
Must Be Prepared.
"And the part that the United
States is to play has this distinction
in it that it Is to be, In any event, a
disinterested part. There is nothing
that the United States wants that it
has to get by war but there are a
great many things that the United
States has to do. It has to see that
its life is not interfered with by any
body else who wants something.
"These aro the days when we are
making preparation, when the thing
most commonly discussed around ev
ery sort of table In every sort of cir
cle, In the shops and in the streets
is preparedness and undoubtedly, gen
tlemen, that is the present Imperative
duty of America, to be prepared. But
wo ought to know what we aro pre
paring for. I remember hearing a
wise man say onco that the old max
im that 'everything comes to the
man who waits' is all very well pro
vided he knows what he Is waiting
for; and preparations might be a very
hazardous thing If we did not know
what we wanted to do with the force
that we mean to accumulate and to
get into fighting shape.
No Country Like America.
"America, fortunately, does know
what she wants to do with her force.
America came into existence for a
particular reason. You are
so familiar with American history at
any rate in its general character I
don't accuso you of knowing the details--of
it- for I never "found the
youngster who did but you are so
familiar with the general character
of American history that It does not
seem strange to you, but it is a very
strange history. There is none other
like it In the whole annals of man
kindof men gathering out of every
civilized nation of the world, on an
unused continent, and building up the
policy exactly to suit themselves, not
under the domination of any ruling
dynasty or of the ambitions of any
royal family.
Principles Must Not Be Marred.
"Now what we are preparing to do
Is to see that nobody mars that, and
that, being safe itself against interfer
ence from the outside, all of its force
is going to be behind its moral idea,
and- mankind is going to know that
when America speaks she means
what she says. I heard a man say to
another 'If you wish me to consider
you witty I must really trouble you
to make a joke.' We have a right to
say to the rest of mankind 'if you
don't want to interfere with us, if you
are disinterested, we must really trou
ble you to give the evidence of that
fact.' We are not In for anything sel
fish and we want tho whole mighty
power of America thrown into that
scale and not Into any other.
Defines Militarism.
"You know that the chief thing
that is holding many people back
from enthusiasm for what is called
preparedness is the fear of militarism.
I want to say a word to you, young
gentlemen, about militarism. You're
not a militarist because you aro mili
tary. Militarism does not consist in
the existence of an army, not even in
the existence of a very big army.
Militarism Is a spirit. It is a point of
view. It Is a system. It is a pur
pose. Tho purpose of militarism Is
to use armies for aggression. The
spirit of militarism Is the opposite
of the civilian spirit the citizen
spirit. In a country where militarism
prevails the military man looks down
upon the civilian, regards him as in
force, thinks of him as intended for
his, tho military man's, support and
use and just so long as America is
America that spirit and point of view
Is impossible with us. There is as
yet in this country, so far as I can
discover, no taint of tho spirit of
militarism.
West Pointers, Representative
Citizens.
"You, young gentlemen, arc not
preferred in promotion because of
the families you belong to. You are
not drawn into the academy because
you belong to certain Influential cir
cles. You do not come here with a
long tradition of military pride" back
of you. You ax-e picked out from the
citizens of tho United States to be
that part of the force of (he United
States which makes its policy safe
against interference. You aro the
part of American citizens who say
to those who would Interfere: 'You
must not' and 'You shall not.' But,
you are American citizens, and the
idea I want to leave with you boys
today is this:
"No matter what comes, always re
member that first of all you arc citi
zens of the United States before you
are officers and that you are officers
because you represent in your pro
fession what the citizenship of the
United States stands for. There is
no danger of militarism if you are
genuine Americans and I for one do

BRYAN PROPOSES
FORMING PACT
Time Ripe to Adopt Progres
sive Principles and Win
Bull Moose Votes.
COMES AS REPORTER
Has No Official Part in Con
vention and Will Accept
Seat on Floor as De
feated Delegate.
St. Louis, Mo., June 13. William J.
Bryan, newspaper reporter from Ne
braska, arrived here today to "cover"
the Democratic national convention.
He asserted most emphatically that
his reportorial role would be his first
interest. But the former secretary
of state, chief builder of many Demo
cratic platforms, including the one
on which the party now stands, and
author of numerous peace treaties,
has a new treaty to propose to other
the Democrats and Progressives to in
duce most of the Bull Mooso to sup
port the Democratic ticket next fall.
"Now is the opportune time for the
Democratic party to get most of the
Progressives" said Mr. Bryan In a
hasty across-the-corridor interview as
he reached his hotel today.
"Tho Progressives were not at all
satisfied with the results of their con
vention at Chicago" Mr. Bryan con
tinued earnestly "I believe tho time
is ripe for the Democrats to secure
a large part of tho Progressive vote.
In Sympathy With Progressives.
"They are closest to us In sympathy
anyway, you know" Mr. Bryan added.
He indicated that this might be large
ly accomplished by tho writing of tho
Democratic platform with Progressive
planks that would appeal to theBull
Moose. i
"I have no plans except to report
this convotlon" was Mr. Bryan's cryp
tic answer when asked If ho would
address the convention or appear be
fore the resolutions' committee in be
half of peace and anti-militaristic
planks or take any part in the vlco
presidential contest.
When Mr. Brynn arrived few of the
Democratic leaders were out of bed.
but ho held an impromptu reception
In the hotel lobby and with dlffrculty
made his way .through a crowd of
hand shakers to his room. A largo
percentage of those who greeted him
were 'fellow correspondents.
Will Not Occupy Seat on Floor.
Later Mr, Bryan made the follow
ing statement:
"I havo come to the convention as
a newspaper correspondent and do not
expect to take any official part in the
convention. Having ibeen defeated
for delegate in my own state I will not
accopt a scat on the floor of tho con
vention as an alternate from Nebraska
nor accept a proxy from any other
state"
Mr. Bryan had several callers dur-.
ing tho day and talked about the sit
uation. I
