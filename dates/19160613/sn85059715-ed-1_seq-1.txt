interest But the formei secretary
of state has ? new treaty to pro post!
to other Democratic leaders- -a pact
between the Democrats and Progressives
to induce most of the Bull
Moose to support the Democratic

' Now is the opportune time for the
Democratie party lo get most of the
Progressives." said Bryan as he
reached his hotel. "The Progressives
were no! at all satisfied with
the result of their convention at Chicago."
Mr. Bryan continued. "I heilevo
the time if- ripe for !?? Democrats
to secure a large part of the
Progressive vote. They are closest to
us in sympathy anyway, you know."
Mr Bryan added.
He indicated that this might he
largely accomplished by the writing
of the Democratic platform with Progressive
planks that would appeul to
the Bull Moose
! have no plans except to report
this convention." was Mr. Bryan's
answer when asked if he would address
the convention or appear he
fore the resolutions committee In hehalf
of peace and antl-mllltarlst
planks.
When Mr. Bryan arrived few of the
Democratic leaders were out of bed
but he had an impromptu reception
In the hotel lobby and with difficulty
made his way through a crowd of
handshakers to bin room.
Later Mr. Bryan made the following
statement:
^ T have come to the convention as
n newspaper correspondent a nil did
not expect to take any official part In
* Ihe convention. Having been defeated
for delegate in my own state I will
not accept a seat on the floor of the
convention as an alternate front Nebraska
nor accept a proxy from any
titer state."

Wonderful improvement in the work
of this year's 'rookies" Is shown over .
those of last year. This is chiefly ar- !
counted for by the presence of maify 1
of last year's students, who are taking
more advanced work this year. Their
presence in the ranks steadies the
newer men Most of the 1915 men
were placed in command of sqiiAds |

training of the recruits was done by ,
them. The second-year students have
been given the privilege of taking instruction
in other branches of the ser-(
vice than the infantry, flood sized de- | '
tachments of the regular cavalry, ar
tillery and hospital troops are present,
at Plattsburg. and they have taken the
rolls of instructors. The elective,
courses have also been partially
