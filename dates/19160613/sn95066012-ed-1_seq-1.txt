REFORMED FORGER
HOWARD E. SIIH
III TROUBLE
Paroled Pen Wizzard Said to Have
Fallen from Grace
UNDER ARREST IN BURLINGTON
Trailed from St. Paul by Burns De
tectives Who Claim He Has
Been Making Bad Checks.
Charles Edward Wheeler, alias
"Howard E. Smith," alias 73 other
names and with a reputation of being
one of the most expert forgers in the
country, who has posed as a reformed
lawbreaker, la under arrest at Bur
lington charged with having returned
to his old game of securing "easy
money."
Wheeler or "Smith" has a number of
acquaintances in Bennington acquired
since his release from Windsor on
parole. It was here that his long and
successful career of forgery was
brought to an end through the efforts
of Former State's Attorney W. J.
Meagher In 1913.
Wheeler was arrested in Burlington
Monday morning on the complaint of
the William J. Burns International
detective agency.
Wheeler arrived In Burlington Sun
day from St. l'aul, Minn., and was ar
rested on a warrant made out by Pro
bation Officer Sherman.
The man was given a hearing before
Judges Fred W. Hall and Henry W.
Tracy, assistant judges of Chittenden
county court, yesterday afternoon on
the charge of having violated his pro
bation and also his parole. The facts
were laid before the court by Pro
bation Officer A. L. Sherman, and the
detective stated that he would have
depositions sent on from the West If
tho prisoner was not ready to plead
guilty. When asked by tho court
what he had to say, Wheeler stated
that he was guilty, that he had tried to
improve his mode of living but he had
been beaten by "the system". He did
not go into much detail as to just what
he meant to imply by "the system,"
other than that If, when he was liberat
ed from the Windsor prison, ho had
been given a "lucrative position,"
whereby he would have been aide to
make a comfortable living, he would
have led a different life. He waxed
dramatic and suddenly stopped with
the state ment that he had accumulat
ed debts and was crowded for payment
and that he had robbed Peter to pay
Paul and had passed bogus checks be
cause that method of meeting his ob
ligations came easier to him than
others.
Wheeler is said to be one of two
men most feared by the American
Banker's Association. He lias oper
ated in nearly every state in the
Union, his method being, as he him
self said in a confession made in
February, 1913, when he was sentenced
to three to five years at Vermont State
prison for forgery, as follows: He
would go to a city, engage head
quarters, look over tho place, and
when ho was satisfied he could work
his little game, would place a big or
der for groceries or household furnish
ings with a local dealer, paying for it
with a forged check for a largo amount
and taking the change.
This game was worked successfully
by him in perhaps a hundred cities,
all over the country, among them be
ing New York, Philadelphia, Buffalo,
Portland, Me., Washington, I). C,
Baltimore and through the South and
West.
After Wheeler had served more
than two years of his sentence at
Windsor ho was paroled by Governor
dates and released October 1, l!)lo.
Since that time for several months
he travelled tho State in the interest
of the "Prison Monitor" of which he
was a contributor and promotor. He
also gave lectures before societies and
clubs, where he could arrange to do
so, on Contract Prison labor. All
this time he went under the name of
Howard E. Smith, tho name under
which ho was arrested In 1913.
He made Burlington his hoadquart
era for several months and was seen
about the streets considerably. Pur
ity; the winter ho left for tho West,
but reported to probation officer
monthly. His letters are -Interesting,
They are written on a typewriter and
signed Howard E. Smith with th
name Charles E. S. Wheeler ahovo.
In the last letter he tells tho Pro
bation officer that ho has got on his
feet at last, has tho agency for a well
known typewriter and that the future
looks bright, lie says that tho name
"Smith" would ever remain dead to
Mm. Ho had assumed his real name
Wheeler from then on.
Shortly afterward tho Burns people
received complaints of forgeries in
the West and as Wheeler's photograph
is on file at 26 of the Burns agencies
it was a comparatively easy thing to
run him down. Ho was recognized by
the photo and description, and the
arrest followed In due course.

THREE AUTO ACCIDENTS
Local Cars Made Record for Minor
Mishaps Monday
Three auto accidents, nono of them
-ous but providing narrow escapes
V, '-'HSt two young men, happened
in c -'ay. The most serious oc
curred u. . en a Ford touring car
belonging to . n .neatman was pass
ing the Ritchie bi- -k. A boy on a bi
cycle was overtaken by the car which
did not allow enough space between
the two and the mudguard of the auto
hit the handle bars. The result was
to throw the boy from the bike square
ly in the path of the machine. The car
passed over his body, tangling the
wheel and the boy up together under
the chassis. The diiver brought the
car to a stop when it was found that
the lad was so twisted up with his bi
cycle it was necessary for several men
to lift one side of the car bodily to per
mit his escape. The strange feature
of the accident was the the lad, beyond
a few minor scratches, was apparently
unhurt.
The second accident happened in
Putnam square in the early evening.
Again a Ford was the unintentional
transgressor. Calvin Moore was cross
ing Main street in hiking costume and
carried a staff. He failed to get from
the path of the motor car quickly
enough and the machine and staff came
together, making a noise that coupled
with the sight of Moore hanging to the
radiator which lie grasped to save him
self from being drawn under the car,
i.ersuadod pedestrains a serious acci
dent had occurred. His injuries were
slight.
Another Ford machine standing in
front of Leahy's market on Safford
street was cranked without due atten
tion being given to the starting appar
atus.. Before it could be controlled by
the diiver it crossed the street, mount
ed a curbing and drove its front into
tho lawn of Homer A. Lyons on County
street. The front wheels were turned
under and the steering gear smashed
but none of the occupants were injured.
ACCIDENT AVERTED
By Plucky Sacrifice of Car by Wm.
Eddington.
About $10 wortli of damage was done
to the Eddington touring car this noon
when It was necessary to drive the car
into the gutter to avoid crashing into
a rig containing two women.
William Eddington was driving the
machine. When opposite Houran s
grocery store he was going about 10
miles an hour when a rig ahead with
two women, started to circle the street
and head the other way without warn-
Ins. - --
If they had kept going, Eddington
would have had time to go past their
rear. Finding tho car almost upon
them, however, they became confused
and stopped the horse.
The driver had about three seconds
to decide between hitting the wagon
or sacrificing his car. He veered to
one side hoping to leap the curb. The
wheel crumpled, however, and by a
miracle the car came to a slop without
throwing him out. The women drove
away without learning how much dam
age they had caused.

HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK
Candidate Kept Open House Till Late
Hour Renewing Political
Acquaintanceships.
New York, June 13. Charles E.
Hughes re-entered polities yesterday,
apparently with abundant zest. He
reached the city eaily in tho day, es
tablished temporary headquarters at
an uptown hotel and virtually held
open house until nearly midnight.
Scores of persons on various missions
flocked to his rooms, mostly people
who had known him back in the days
when he was campaigning lor governor
of New York. There was also a sprink
ling of party leaders among his callers.
Mr. Hughes issued no statement
yesterday and expects to issue none
till ho is formally notified of his nom
ination. The subcommittee to confer
with him as to fixing a date for the
ceremony probably will wait on him
in a few days and until then, it is
understood, he will allow his tele
gram to Chairman Harding of the re
publican national committee to stand
as his declaration of principles with
out further comment.
Although the nominee's plans arc
still unsettled as to virtually all the
details of the campaign, it is likely
that he will remain in New York until
the 20th, when he expects to attend
a reunion of the class of 'SI of Brown
university at Providence.
To those who knew the nominee as
a supreme court justice there was a
marked difference in his bearing yes
terday. His air of studious reserve ap
parently left him with the robes of his
office. His eye sparkled with en
joyment, he had a hearty handclasp
and a smile for every man he met
and seemed enthusiastic in his wel
come of old friends who came to see
him after intervals of years.
Although felicitations were numer
ous, there was also serious considera
tion of campaign plans. The chief af
fairs requiring the nominee's immedi
ate attention are the selection of a
national chairman, the opening of
headquarters and deciding on a sum
mer headquarters for himself. Sev
eral party leaders submitted sugges
tions on all three topics, all of which
Mr. Hughes took under consideration.
Attempts to obtain further expres
sions from Mr. Hughes as to ids views
on the issues of the day were un
successful and it was made plain to
callers that there is no Intention on
his part to say anything concerning
them until his formal notification.

COLONEL SILEIII
AS TO ULTIMATE
Statement is Coming But Gives
Ko Hint of What or When
HENRY J. ALLEN HOPEFUL
Kansas Progressive Leader Confident
Roosevelt Will Help to Elect
Hughes.
Oyster Bay, N. Y., June 13. Col.
Theodore Hoosevelt was visited at his
homo at Sagamore Hill, yesterday by
James R. Garfield and William Draper
Lewis. According to his secretary,
John W. MeCrath, who returned from
Chicago, the colonel "had a full and
frank discussion' with Mr. Garfield
and Dean Lewis "as to what he Intends
to say-' with regard to the political
situation and 'tho time he should say
it." Neither of the visitors would
make any statement after their inter
view with Col. Hoosevelt. Both have
been prominent in progressive party
circles, Dean Iewis having drafted
the platform adopted by the Chicago
convention.
Col. Hoosevelt again secluded him
self in his home yesterday except for
a couple of hours when lie went for
a horseback ride with Mrs. Hoosevelt.
A newspaper correspondent who met
the colonel iu the road asked if there
was anything he cared to say, but the
former president turned from him after
a sharp reply in the negative.
St. Louis, Mo., Juno 13. Henry J.
Alkn, Kansas progressive leader as a
newspaper corresiondent reporting the
democratic convention, who has an
nounced his support of Mr. Hughes,
yesterday expressed belief that Col.
Roosevelt ulso will take an active part
in the Hughes campaign. Mr. Allen
said that former Representative Victor
Murdock, chairman of the progressive
national committee was most promi
nently suggested to succeed Col Hoose
velt as the progressive standard bear
er if Col. Roosevelt-finally refused the
nciiiiiiation,
"I think' Mie hour is too important
for any man to worry about the name
of a party he is going to support."
sahl Mr. Allen. "If Col. Hoosevelt ac
cepts the splendid statement of Mr.
Hughes as meeting the conditions
which he laid down to the progressive
convention, a majority of tho
gressive convention, a majority of the
progressives In the central and north
ern states will support Mr. Hughes.
As far as I am personally concerned,
if Mr. Hoosevelt declines the progres
sive nomination I will support Mr.
Hughes. 1 think the fight is going to
be cleanly between Wilson and
Hughes, and in that case. 1 prefer
Hughes. As 1 read tho Hughes state
ment it seems to me to meet the con
ditions laid down by Col. Hoosevelt,
and I believe Col. Hoosevelt will main
tain rather on important relationship
to the Hughes propaganda."
Raymond Robins, chairmamn of the
progressive national convention, and
Harold Ickes, progressive national
committeeman for Illinois, will leave
Chicago today or tomorrow for Oys
ter Bay to talk over tho party situa
tion with Col Hoosevelt. Mr. Ickes
said the national committee was all
at sea when it met Saturday. In a
joint statement Issued yesterday Rob
ins and Ickes counseled progressives
to await patiently the meeting of the
national committee on the 26th, w hen
It will be decided what action the
party w ill take.

STRONGER MAN PLEA FUTILE
Organization Men Say Vice-President
Will Again Be Wilson's Running
Mate.
St. Louis, June 13. Anteconvention
discussion centered largely yesterday
on moves and suggestions to defeat
plans for the renomination of Vice
President Marshall, and put a new man
on the ticket with President Wilson.
As the number of delegates to the
democratic national convention grew
hourly, greater booms for various fa
vorite sons appeared on the surface to
rise and fall with the tide of talk.
A .move to defeat Vice-President
Marshall for renomination took well
defined form and substance when
Henry Morgenthau, who recently gave
up his post as embassador to Turkey
that he might engage in the work of
re-electing President Wilson, an
nounced that "a stronger man'' than
Marshall should be named, and brought
forward Secretary of War Newton D.
Haker to run with President Wilson.
News that Mr. Morgenthau was
booming Secretary Baker created
something more than a mild discussion
for it was pointed out that Mr. Mor
genthau had been close to the ad
ministration and that It might in
dlcato that the naming of Mr. Baker
would not be unacceptable. Mr.
Morgenthau hastened, however, to
make it clear that he was urging Mr.
Baker's nomination on his own respon
sibility and initiative solely with the
desire of naming the strongest possible
candidate for the office.
National Chairman McCombs said
last night that he had received a tele
gram from Jacob H. Schiff. the New
York banker, asking that a stronger
candidate than Mr. Marshall be named,
and Mr. Morgenthau also stated that
he had a letter from Mr. Schiff request
ing that another than Mr. Marshall be
put on the ticket.
Talk that Secretary Baker's name
would he presented as a candidate for
vice-president caused a rush of dele
gates to national committeemen and
other parly leaders to know If there
had been any chance in the plans to
rename Mr. Marshall. The informa
tion was quickly given that "noses
had been counted long ago,'' and that
while one or two names other than
Mar aH's might be heard on the con
vention floor, the vote for him would
be virtually unanimous, if there is not
a nomination by acclamation.
There will be no hitch in the plan
to rename the present democratic
ticket." said Mr. McCombs last night.
National Committeeman Norman E.
Mack of New York also declared that
the talk of upsetting the plan to re
name Mr. Marshall was silly and ab
surd. Booms for new candidates for
vice-president dill appeared hourly.

night being one for Judge A. M. Jack

A BATHLESS AGE.
For Thousand Years the People of
Europe Went Unwashed,
Wh'.-n Egypt. Greece ami Rome worn
fit tlw height of their ancient power
their citizens made bathing a social
fund Lin, a municipal duty mid n re
ligious observance. The public baths
of these nations were magnificent ar
chitecturally and important as centers
of hygienic und municipal sentiment.
With the decadence of thes( coun
tries the world seems to have reverted
to a period of mental sloth and physi
c:il uiiclcaniiness. As an authority on
the matter puts it:
"For l.fK'U years there was not a
man or woman in Europe that ever
took a bath, If tho historian of those
times, Michelct, Is to be believed. The
ancient love of the bath seemed to
have disappeared from off the laud.
"There was no Greece or Rome to
bold up the ensign of cleanliness to the
nations of Europe. Small wonder that
tin? people of the continent became
physical decadents, as indeed they
were in. spite of tradition to the oon
t ra ry.
"It Is ii't strange that there came
the awful epidemics that cut off one
fourth of the population of Europe
.he spotted plague, the hit!' k death,
the sweating sickness and the terrible
mental epidemics that f.llowcd in thdr
train the dancing mania, the mewing
iu:inl:i and the biting mania.
"The bath was Iviulshed and filth
was almost deified. Indeed, it was
then thought that the sn net ideation of
the body wm only accomplished when
that body was indescribably dirty."

CZEfllIZ
Capital of Bukowina Evacuated by
Justrians
SUV DRIVE CAN'T BE CHECKED
Stubborn Resistence by Teutons
Proves to Be But Temporarily
Effective.
London, Juno 13. Russian troops on
Sunday approached the outskirts of
Czernowitz, the capital of Bukowina,
the war office announced at Petrograd
yesterday. The statement also says the
Russian troops attacked the bridge
head at Zalesczyky. As the Russian
troops drew near Czernowitz, the re
port says, there were numerous ex
plosions caused by the Austrians with
in tho city.
Czernowitz, the objective of tho
Russian drive on this part of the
front, was in possession of the Rus
sians for some time early in the war,
but they were compelled to evacuate
the city during the progress of tho
Austro-German offensive. Zalesczyky
is on the river Dniester 30 miles
northwest of Czernowitz.
A rumor was in circulation at Petro
grad yesterday that the Russians have
occupied Czernowitz, capital of tho
Austrian crownland of Bukowina. Tho
rumor lacks official confirmation, but
it has been given color by the capture
of Dobronovtze, a commanding point
10 miles northeast. The Russian line
here extends to Okna. From both
these points good roads lead direct to
Czernowitz and, according to military
authorities, they are the only points

says the Austrian army has evacuated

It is not believed at Petrograd that
the Germans are sending many troops
to aid the Austrians. It is pointed out
that only in one instance during
Russia's spectacular Carpathian cam
paign did Germany send any large
number of men to the relict of tho
Austrians. instead it has always been
their practice to undertake an of

servers at Petrograd think the Ger
mans are more likely to attempt an
offensive on the northern section of
the Russian front than to risk weak
ening their lines by detaching any
number of men for the purpose of
stiffening the Austrian defense.
