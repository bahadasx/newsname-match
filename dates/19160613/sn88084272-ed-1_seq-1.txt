o.nd the ideals of America. He declared
it is the present Imperative duty of the
I'mted States to be prepared, adding:
"Mankind is going to know that when
America speaks she means what she

The president said the United States
-hould not be a Mastering nation, a

but a calm nation which will withhold

"Put America First."
Shaking his Xlnger emphatically, the

The word "Americanism" was used

i..rt for the altered murder of whom '
Will Orpet is on trial here, threatened j
to commit suicide if it proved true mat
Orpet had transferred his affections
to another.
The school girl witness, called by the
state, continued to testify for the de
fence. She completely repudiated pre
vious stories of the cheerfulness of Ma
rian, her chum, and told of spells of
depression over fear that she was in
a delicate condition and later, when
this fear became less acute after Jan
uary IS, over the reported defection of
Orpet, a student at the University or
Wisconsin was engaged to marry Ce
leste Youker. according to the witness.
" I wonder why she told me that.'
Marian said to me," related Miss Davis.
"Maybe it was just to make me feel
bad.'
"So we framed up a letter to Orpet.
but as no reply -was received, Marian
began to think that Miss Mason had
told the truth. It was on February 6
when Marian had her 18th anniversary
party that she threatened to kill her
self. "Honest, if Billie has thrown me
over, I'll kill myself.' she told me.
"I laughed at her Just to try to get
her out of the mood and then she
laughed too. I said, 'You won't let me
tell everything to your mother now:
hall I tell what I know after death T
She laughed and said, -well, I guess
not. There will be gossip anyway and
we might as well give them something
to gossip about.' "

come to El Paso, believing It unsafe
to remain in the interior.

me of the fight and said that the pis

Gonzales.
"As I was told of the fight, a Mex

American soldier of the group in the

with a knife . The soldier drew his
revolver and struck the woman orer
