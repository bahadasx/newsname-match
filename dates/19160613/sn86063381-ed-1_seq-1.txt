Plan on Foot to Park Ten Acres Near
Normal School Council
Interested.
Landscape gardeners have been em
ployed by the state normal school
board and will come to Bemidji this
week to plan the grounds for the new
normal school here.
A P. White, a member of the state
normal school board, made this an
nouncement to the city council at a
meeting last evening. He attended
the meeting of the normal board in
St Paul Saturday.
To Make Plans.
The gardeners will plan the en
tire grounds for the school and engi
neers will make complete plans for
the school
Mr. White brought the matter to
the attention of the council because
the city owns a ten-acre park next
to the normal school site. He ad
vised that when the landscape gard
eners arrive in the city that city
authorities confer with them as to
making plans for the city parks. The
council was unanimous in its opinion
that the plan was a good one and the
park committee, composed of Alder
men Foucault, Moberg and Smart, Al
derman Lycan, Mayor Charles Van
dersluis and City Engineer Swinson'
were appointed a committee to con
fer with the gardeners.
May Improve Parks.
Plans may be made later for the
improving of all the city parks. It
was suggested at the meeting last
evening that the city authorities
should confer with the Bemidji
Townsite company as to making
Block 20 near the M. & I. depot into
a park. Action may be taken at
some future time.
Mr. White in his talk to the coun
cil pointed out that it was planned
to construct a main building, dormi
tory and central heating plant for
the normal school at the present
time. The normal board will make
application for $250,000 for this
purpose when the next legislature
meets.
He stated that the entire normal
school would be planned before con
struction is begun. Other schools
were just planned section by section
and the best of results were not se
cured.
A Model School.
State authorities are much pleased
on account of the large site for the
normal school in this city. The
school will be made a model school.
In regard to the spending of the
present appropriation of $25,000,
Mr. White stated that some of the
money may be spent this week when
the gardeners arrive in the city. He
stated that the board may decide to
begin the construction of the central
heating plant. All the money may
not be spent until the legislature
makes an additional appropriation.
SUNDAY SCHOOL
TO GIVE PROGRAM
The M. E. Sunday school will give
a Children's Day program next Sun
day morning at eleven o'clock at the
church. The children have been
practicing for the past week and an
excellent program is assured.
