WASHINGTON, June 12. With
1500 additional regular troops ordered
to the Mexican border tonight, and re
ports of the rapid spread of anti-American
feeling continuing to pour in
from consuls all over nqrthern Mexico
administration officials made no at
tempt to disguise their uneasiness. It
was officially admitted that there is
increasing alarm over w.hat the agita
tion may produce and the possibility
of an attack on General Pershine's
expedition. j
here is due to the renewed raids in
the Laredo region. Several reports
dealing with the situation there have
been received. Officials declined to
reveal details, but they gave the im
pression of having reason to believe a
serious purpose was behind the bandit
raid on the Coleman Ranch. Three
raiders were killed and three captured
one raider admitting that they meant
to burn a railroad bridge near Laredo,
but failed.
The new force sent to join General
Funston's border patrol. Secretary
Baker said, was to till in gaps in the
guard such as that near Laredo. It
wil! be composed of 10 companies of
coast artillery and a battalion of engi
neers. The artillerymen will be with
drawn from fortifications between
Portland, Maine, and Sandy Hook, and
the engineers will go from barracks
in tl-.iscity. The secretary said there
wa3 no present intention of calling ad
di'ional national guard regiments for
border duty.
Soldier Wounded
General Mann, commanding at I-ar-
edo, reported today that a patrol of
three cavalrymen was flre't on during
the night of June 10, near the town of
Hach'ta, and Private W. L. Saunders
of Troop K, 12th cavalry, was slightly
wounded.
A message from Captain Burrage,
commanding the battleship Nebraska,
at Vera Cruz, said there was .consider
able unrest in that region, due appar
ently to the currency situation.
There i
was no evidence of unfriendliness to-!
wards Americans, the message said.
It added that the .Carranzistas had j
been sending troops and ammunition
inland. Captain Burrage did not know
the object of these troop movements.
' Outbreaks Remarked
The state department. through
Special Agent Rodgers at Mexipo City
has called the attention of the de facto
government to fie anti-American out
breaks which for nearly two weeks
have been spreading steadily. Many
towns have held ma38 meetings and
protested the continued presence of
American troops in Mexico.
In two or three instances American
property has been attacked but no
threats against lives of Americans
have been reported. The reports of
consuls telling of the agitations were
turned over to the Carranza officials
more as a matter of information than
as representations. Wrhere his regu
lar troops are in control, apparently
. General Carranza has earnestly tried
in most cases to prevent the holding
of protest meetings, and in some plac
es contemplated meetings and parades
ave been prohibited. There are in
stances, however, where the troops ap
pear to have stood idly by while the
agitators stirred us antagonism a
gainst the United States.
Officials have been unable to deter
mine the inspiration behind the sud
den outbreak of anti-American feeling
or to estimate the ability of General
Carranza to protect American lives
and property. They feel that the real
danger lies in the possible action of
irregular forces now under the Car
ranza banner, but whose commanders
yield only doubtful allegiance to the
central government.
Consuls Pessimistic
Because of economic conditions in
Mexico, officials feel that the possibili
ty of serious trouble is enhanced. The
currency situation is acute and the
people are restless and easily Btirred
to outbreaks. Several consular agents
have declared frankly in their reports
that any eventuality might be expect
ed if the agitation continued to spread.
Secretary Lansing still is at work
on his reply to the Carranza note de
manding withdrawal pt American forc
es. H again declined today to dis
cuss it in any respect. It is not known
whether the present disturbed condi

AVhile Great Britain has indi-

that the examination of de
tained neutral mails would be
hastened as much as possible,
it was stated tonight that these
concessions would be consider
ed only a minor question affect
ing the right of seizure over
which the two governments
have disagreed.
Intimations have reached the
department that in the British
reply now being prepared, it
would formally call attention
to the steps taken to reduce de
lay in mail examination thus
disposing of many specific com
plaints in the American pro
test, but would not accede to
the American position that the
allies had exceeded their right
in enforcing their censorship
outside territorial waters and
had employed "vexatiously in

ing it. "Such a reply would
be considered far short of
clearing the situation.

Captain Bell, With Men Of
14th Cavalry, Disappears in
Pursuit Of Outlaws Who
Raided Laredo, Texas.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
, LAREDO, Tex., June 12. Interest
attached toniRht to the whereabouts
of Captain Ola W. Bell and his de
tachment of the Fourteenth United
States Cavalry, pursuing bandits who.
during the past forty eight hours.
have made several raids in the border
sect.'jn west and northwest of Laredo.
The raids have resulted in the loss
of several horses stolen from Texas
ranches, and the death of at least
three Mexican bandits and the cap
ture of two.
Reports early tonight were vague
and it was not kr.'jwn here whether
troops or civilian posses killed the
three bandits. No American casual
ties have been reported.
Several Japs.
The bandits, variously reported to
number from eleven Co fifteen includ
ing several Japanese, made their first
raid early Saturday night in the
vicinity of Palafor, Texas, fifty miles
west of Laredo. There they captured
two American cowboys, who escaped
later.
Raided Coleman Ranch.
The second raid occurred Sunday
morning on the Coleman Ranch, forty
miles northwest of Laredo, where the
bandits attempted to drive off eight
lAirses. Reports last night indicated
they failed in their purnose and that
the bandits succeeded in re-entering
Mexico. Advices today were to the
effect that the outlaws had not
crossed to the southern side 'of the
Rio Grande, but had attempted to
burn bridges on the Interrntional and
Great Northern Railway line east of
LaredXJ.
Three Bandits Killed.
Two Mexicans were captured in the
vicinity of a bridge near Webb. Teas.
by cavalrymen, under Captain Wel
born. From best available Informa
tion, the three dead bandits were
tilled in the vicinitv of Webb. Texas
Rangers, armed civilians and .cavalry
men are continuing the pursuit to
night. TRANSPORT READY TO
