of anything decided upon.

COLUMBIA, MISSOURI,
M. U. LEADS IN WEST
SE
So Declares President A. Ross
Hill in Assembly Ad
dress Today.
ENROLLMENT IS 1,200
J. D. Elliff Announces As
semblies for Every Tues
day and Thursday.
"Tlie Summer Session of the Uni
versity of Missouri, which has an en
rollment of 1,200 students, is the larg
est one between the University of Chi
cago and the University of California,"
said President A. Ross Hill in the ad
dress of welcome to the students of
the Summer Session who assembled In
the University Auditorium at 10
o'clock this morning.
"The University of Missouri began
to give summer instruction about
twenty-live years ago," continued
President Hill. "At first the work was
of a high school grade and coverea
chietly the natural sciences. Many of
the students were not high school
graduates and they could not meet the
entrance requiremnts.
'"Th Summer Session work was rais
ed to regular university work in 1901.
Under the old system the school had
an enrollment of about COO students,
but when the new system was adopt
ed, in 1901, the number fell to 200.
"Most of the students enrolled in
tlie Summer Sessions live in Missouri.
This is markedly apparent from the
educational improvement in the state
schools. The work given here is in ad
vance of the work offered tlie his'i
school students.
"The department of education is one
of the strongest during the Summer
Session. Teaching is an imitative
art. The work given assumes that
teaching can be guided and the ideas
gained can bo practiced.
"A profession is a poor one if it is
only imitative; teaching is also re
flective. The University does not neg
lect tho other subjects. One cannot
teach a subject until he knows it bel
ter than tho pupils.
"The spirit of the new learning is
tho spirit of acquiring and extending
knowledge."
Prof. J. TK Elliff, director of the
Summer Session, announced that at 10
o'clock every Tuesday and Thursday
morning assembly will be held in the
University Auditorium.
In closing, the audience sang
"America" and "old Missouri," with
Prof. W. H. Pommer at the piano.
"MOOSE WILL NOMINATE AMAIN
So Declares F. W. Xiedermeyer, Dele
gate to Party Ciimu'iitiiin.
"Tlie Progressive Party will un
doubtedly go ahead and nominate a
candidate for the coming presidential
election." said F. W. Xiedermeyer,
1101 University avenue today.
Mr. Xiedermeyer was a delegate to
the Progressive Convention last week
in Chicago.
"Roosevelt may yet run," continu
ed Mr. Xiedermeyer, "if the National
Committee calls him to lead tlie party;
however Jolmson of California or Vic
tor H. Murdock of Kansas would also
make a good running mate for Parker
of Louisiana, the nominee for vice
president, and both are strong in the
Progressive principles, while Johnson
is especially a big successful fight
er." Noticeable features, according to Mr.
Niedermeyer, were the lack of enthu
siasm among tho G. O. P. delegates
and the constant high pressure in the
Progressive meetings. The bosses
never lost their firm hold on the steer
ing wheel of the "Old Guard." he said,
and actions proceeded with a tircsorne
nicety. At the Auditorium every man
was wholly and solely for "Teddy,"
and all at first refused to believe the
sad news that T. R. had conditionally
declined the nomination.
Mrs. Moss to Report on Colleges.
Mrs. Luella Wilcox St. Clair-Moss,

JUDGE WMID DIES
Heart Disease Is Supposedly
tlie Cause He Dropped
Dead in Kitchen.
William W. Reid, former county
judgo of Lincoln County, .Missouri, and
retired banker of Klsberry, Mo., died
at his home, COO Conley avenue at
noon today. Mr. Reid was 71 years
old. He is survived by his widow,
Mrs. Jessie Reid, two daughters, Vir
ginia and Elizabeth, 11 and 13 years
old respectively, and one son, Wil
liam, 17 years old.
The cause of his death is not known,
although it is supposed that it was
heart disease. His death occurred in
the kitchen of his home, where he fell
suddenly to the floor in the presence
of his wife, who immediately called
neighbors and a doctor. When the lat
ter arrived Mr. Reid was dead. He had
been in ill health for some time, but
his death is not attributed to that, al
though his weakened condition prob
ably hastened his death.
Before his connection with a bank
at Klsberry, Mr. Reid was for twenty
years judge of the Lincoln County
Court, acting for four years as pre
siding otlicers. After severing connec
tions with tlie bank In 1912. he re

til word is received from his son, who
is reported to be near Kingsley, Kan.

NUMBER 245
M, U, GIRL CREDITED
WITH ANJLOPEMENT
Miss Ruth Hathorn Finds
That Circumstances Con
spired Against Her.
HER TRAIN WAS LATE
Then Helpful Acquaintance
Told His Story, and the
Family Worried.
A late train, a solicitous acquaint
ance, an anxious mother and a first
trip to the I'niversity are responsible
for a story which appeared in St. Louis
papers yesterday regarding the elope
ment of Miss Ruth Hathorn of Center
town, Cole County.
Miss Hathorn left home Saturday
and passed through JefTerson City on
her way to Columbia, where she is novr
attending the Summer Session. Ar
rangements bad been made for her to
room at the house of Mrs. Hornbeck,
713 Gentry place.
Miss Hathorn stayed over in Jeffer
son City a few hours and spent the
time with a friend. The solicitous
acquaintance, who saw the two to
gether, conjured up the idea of an
elopement. The train which brought
Miss Hathorn to Columbia was late.
and she did not arrive at .Mrs. Horn-
beck's until after tlie anxious mother
had telephoned to Columbia and found
that the daughter had not yet arrived.
Then the acquaintance reported the
mpposcd elopement to the girl's fam
ily, and a brother living in East St.
Louis notified the police to block any
attempt at an elopement. Tlie St.
Louis paiiers printed the story as seen
by the worried family.
All the while the story was spread
ing. Miss Hathorn was safe in Colum
bia and not only wrote but telephoned
to various members of her family,
while other members frantically asked
the University authorities for informa
tion. But Miss Hathorn was at last dis
covered and the family notified. After
this, she says, she will keep the fam
ily informed of her progress.
