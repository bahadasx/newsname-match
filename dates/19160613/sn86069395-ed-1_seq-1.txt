Orleans, is 53 years old and is a
wealthy land owner.
Our most serious objection to the
ticket is that Mr. Burkett, of some
where out west, allowed himself to
be out-voted for the vice-presidential
nomination by the Indiana iceberg.
It would have been not only more
euphonious but especially appropriate
to have on its ticket something for a
dying party to kick.

ROOSEVELT AND PARKER FOR B. H.
Colonel Says He Will See
Them Later On the Ques
tion of Running.
Chicago, June 12. Charles Evans
Hughes, former governor of New
York and associate justice of the su
preme court, was nominated Saturday
for the presidency by the republican
national convention.
Charles Warren Fairbanks, of Indi
ana, elected vice-president with Theo
dore Roosevelt in 1904, again was
chosen for second place on the re
publican ticket.
Both nominations, made by over
whelming majorities on the first bal
lot of the day the third ballot of the
convention for the presidency were
by acclammation made unanimous.
Senator Lodge, of Massachusetts,
presented by Col. Roosevelt as a com
promise candidate, received seven
votes. Col. Roosevelt himself re
ceived eighteen and one-half scattered
over twelve states.
The convention was notable in poli
tical history foVmany things. A man
who steadfastly had refused to seek
the nomination had been chosen; it
was the first republican convention
since 1888 which had been forced to
take more than one ballot to agree
upon a candidate, and it has been
marked by a lack of riotous demon
strations, and nervous enthusiasm
which hitherto has been a feature of
such gatherings.
It did not touch any of the existing
records for sustained demonstrations,
but, despite the fact that in political
vernacular it was wholly and decid
ed V "unhossed," it moved with a
precision and quietness which lias not
been equaled since the McKinley con
vention in Philadelphia.
THE OTHER FACTION CHOOSES
TEDDY.
Chicaco. June 12. The progressive
national convention, after four days'
tumult, with but one nuroosein view.
Saturday nominated Colonel Theodore
Roosevelt for President, and a few
hours later listened without protest to
a message from Oyster Bay that ho
would not "accept at this time.' The
convention adjourned at 4:58 p. m.
Colonel Roosevelt's declination was
conditional, and it was placed in the"
hands of the progressive' national
committee, to be held until such time
as statements to be made by Justice
Hughes, the nominee, of the republi
can party, "shall satisfy the committee
that it is for the interest of the coun
try that ho bo elected."
In the event the committee shall be
satisfied that aid should be given in
the republican party in its fight against
the party now in power, Colonel
Roosevelt's refusal to makoacam
mitm is to bo considered final. It
will then be authorized for the repre
sentatives of tho progressive party to
say whether to endorse the position
taken by Mr. Roosevelt, or whether
thov will name another man to fight
for their party principles.
Capt. John M. Parker, or Louisiana,
was nominated for vico-prcsident, the
selection being by acclamation.
Colonel Roosevelt s running mate
of four years ago, Governor Hiram
.Tnlinsnn. of California, refused to let
his namo be placed before tho con
vention, because of the information
ho had concerning the intentions of

HUGHES.
Candidate Hughes is 54 years old,
was governor of New York 1907-1910
and became a justice by appointment
of President Tnft Oct. 10, 1910. He
has one son and three daughters.
In legal circles his greatest work
has been regarded as the opinion in
the 2-cent rate cases from Minnesota
and a half dozen other states. In his
first year on the bench he announced
the decision holding unconstitutional
an Alabama statute that the court de- j
cicleu sanctioned a torm or peonage.
Later he enunciated a series of opin
ions on the pure food law, in which
he stood for a broad interpretation of
that statute.
In the tost few months he joineik in
holding constitutional an amendment
to the pure food law by which con
gress specifically extended the statute
to apply to 1 'quack mcd icines. " Jus
tice Hughes had Wen outvoted by
his colleague in extending the original
law to such medicines and had sug
gested the need of congress amend
ing the Oklahoma Jim Crow law, ap
plying to interstate commerce, un
constitutional, and dissented from the
court in its action in annulling as un
constitutional a Kansas statute making
it a criminal offense for an employer
to require an employe to agree-not to
join a union. He also dissented in the
Leo. M. Frank case, joining Justice
Holmes in holding that Frank had
not been accorded a fair trial on. tho
indictment of having murdered the
factory girl, Mary Phagan, at Atlanta.
He had rendered tho court's opinion
announcing tho Arizona labor law un
constitutional becauso it denied to
foreigners an opportunity to work.
A marriage licenso was granted
Friday evening to James L. Shippard,
of Opelika, Okla and MissClytio Lee

was scheduled for Friday night.
While an old houso was being torn

London, June 12. From the wood
ed region in the southeast of Russia to
the Roumanian frontier, the Russians
are keeping up their tremendous of
fensive against the Austro-IIungarians
who have been reinforced on several
sectors by Germans.
The advance of the Russians is nota
ble for the large number of prisoners
token and the enormous capture of
guns, machine guns, ammunition and
other war stores. In the week that
has elapsed since they first threw
their attacks against tho Austrians,
the Russians report that they havo
captured approximately 108,000 offi
cers and men and forced back the or
ganized lines of their antagonists from
the region of the Volhynian fortress
triangle to Rumania.
DUBNO IS RETAKEN.
Having previously captured Lutsk,
the Russians now have retaken Dubno,
the second of the fortresses in tho
Volhynian triangle held by the Aus
trians, and are pressing the retreating
Austrians westward. In Galicia and
Bukowina progress also has been
made by the Russians.
The Austrians all along the battle
front are putting up a stubborn resist
ance, especially east of Kolki, lying
to the north of Lutsk where they have
forced back Russian advanced regi
ments across the Styr river and the
region of Torgovitsy on the Styr
south of Lutsk where a sanguinary
battle is in progress.

Since Saturday night when three
German infantry attacks against the
French trenches on Hill 30-1 and other
