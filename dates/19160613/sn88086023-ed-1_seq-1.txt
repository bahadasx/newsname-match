In going to La Grande, Prof, Hamp
j ton will leave a great many friends Jn
I'endleton who will regret his depart
ure genuinely. As principal of the
high school for nine years he was
largely Instrumental in raining that
institution to its present high ttand
ard. While he has always taken a
ci'Hiiaioii fill i in an voueuuonai ste
Hvitles in the city, his greatest succeayi
here has been as a "boy man." The I
tact that In his ten years in the '
bchools here there has never been a
itudent Insurrection and that he has
BMW expelled a boy or glr from the
schools is the highest testimonial to
his ability In supervising young peo
ple. His record here has won for
him recognition all over the state.
Prof. Hampton also drew considerable
notice while here, when as coach ol
the high school debating team for
five years, he won for the scool two
state championships and sent four
teams into the finals.
He will go over to La Grande in the
morning to confer with the board and
superintendent there.

SHOW ARE MISLEADING
IN EVERY W AY.
There is considerable resentment in
Pendleton over the posters being sent
out by the men back of a wild west
show to he staged at Ashland on
July 4-5-6. Tri bold type is printed
"See tbe Pendleton Round-up at Ash
land July 4-5-6." wrth a slogan, imi
tative of the local slogan, reading "Let:

The fact that there is absolutely no
connection between the Pendleton
liound-l'p and the tittle show which
ih to he staged at Ashland makes the
advertisements manifestly fraudulen'..
In the view of the Round-up directors.
The misrepresentation, it is pointed
out, will do the local show an injus- j
lice inasmuch as it Is but a small af
fair and can In no -ay vie with the
big September attraction in this city.
Other places, putting on wild west
thoWa, have borrowed the name
"RoUXtd-Up" and have adopted the
Kound-t'p slogan but none have ever
been so brazen as deliberately to use
tbe name Pendleton.

TELLS MILITARY GRADUATES
In Speech at West Point Today Wil

Be Shown That America Means
What She Says U:ien she Speaks:
l.s Heady to Enforce Justice,
WEST POINT, June 13 "The
world is going to know that when
America speaks she means what she
says," President Wilson told the grad
uating class of the military academy
today. He promised in behalf of Am
erica to uphold the Monroe Doctrine.
He promised that when the time
comes America will be ready to Join
the other nations to "see that the kind
of Justice prevails everywhere that we
believe In."
Being military does not mean mili
taristic, the president said. Mention
ing a small number who love their
native country more than the coun
try of their adoption he said, "nobody
who does not put America first can
consort with us."
"The Fnited States wants nothing
that it must get by war." he contin
ued, "these are dais when we are
making preparations. The thing most
commonly discussed is preparedness.
Undoubtedly it is a present imperative
duty that America be prepared. But
we in ust know what we are preparing
for. "Preparedness might be a hazard
ous thing if we did not know what we
wanted to do with the force we ac
cumulate to get Into fighting shape.
1 hie thing in which our forefathers
took pride was that the civil power
was superior to the military power."
