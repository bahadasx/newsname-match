McCombH' phrase, "stumbling

among other things: .
"The progressives have auatalned

be more Indicative of how demo

fact that the great commoner, four
times a dominant figure In national
conventlona and three times demo
cracy's candidate tor presidential
houors, now figures In the councils
of that party as a mere alternate
delegate from Nebraska and a re
porter. Wn all the platform talk heard to
day there was no Indication that the
former aecretary of state would have
a hand In the hewing of the planks,
He plodged himself not to Inject the
prohibition Issue Into the convention
and having done so, the democrats
were today willing to let Bryan atone,

human vigor, the Russian armies of
General Brusslloff are now hammer
ing their way to Lemberg, the Ga

demoralised Austrian defenders are
rolling back before them. It Is now
estimated that more than one-third
of the men In the Austrian armies on
the east front have been killed,
wounded or taken prisoner since the
giant offensive started June 4. ,
Approximately 120,000 men and
officers have been imprisoned to
date. ' In actions such aa that in
which the Russians are engaged the
estimate of conservative critics is two
killed or injured tor every prisoner.
This would mean that a total of 360,-
000 Austrtana have been put out of

trian army on the east front haa been
variously estimated at from 700,000
to 1,000.000 men. 1 ,
