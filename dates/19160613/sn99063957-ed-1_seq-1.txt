(United Press staff correspondent.)
New York, June 13. Charles E.
Hughes, whiskers, smiled and all, is
to look every American square in the
eye and prove -to each that he is not an
iceberg.
The movies will lie the medium. It
became known at the candidate's
headquarters in the Astor hotel today
that the tiationnl committee is already
making arrangements to have pictures
of Hughes shown in practically every
movie house in the United States.
It is held that this will dispel the
impression that Hughes is a "thinking
machine" rather than a "regular fel
low." flipping into the crush of persons

strenuous efforts to get good seats on

once taught school, and John J. Waters,
of Mechaniesville. It was in the region
of Mechaniesville that Hughes, in his

Plan Hot Campaign.
Another gift was the eanc carried by
John C. Fremont, the first republican
residential candidate.
A sub-committee of. the national com
mittee is to meet in a few days to dis
cuss campaign details.
Justice Abel K. lllnckman. Justice
Frederick It. Crane and Attorney Henry
A. Mark, all of Brooklyn, were among
Hughes' early morning calers.
No provision has been made to re
reive a call from Colonel Eoosevelt,
none being expected.
Plans for the Hughes offensive into
the enemy's country will probably be
madii today when W. Murray Crane,
one o? the republican "big three," ram
bled into Hughes' reception room, for
a "little talk."

thnt the others may delay the visit un

Hughes that he has been selected repub

some time before nrvt Tuesday. On that
' day he will go to Brown university n.
Providence to attend the thirty-fifth
reunion of his clnss.
Just what Crane has in mind in the
way of a campaign is not known. He

ustria Must Hold Strategic
Positions In Serbia For
Self Protection
By Carl W. Ackennan
(United Press staff correspondent)
Budapest, June 1 (via Berlin, delay-!
ed) "I do not look for the annexa
tion of. any large part of Serbia by
Austria-Hungary," declared Count Al
bert Appenyi, opposition leader in the
Hungarian parliament, in an exclusive
interview granted the United Tress to
day. "Only strategic positions must re
main in our hands."
Count Appenyi is often calied the
"greatest statesman of Hungary."
His statement is important not only
because it is the first public utter
ance by a leading statesman of the
dual monarchy on the Balkan question
but because it gives the world an in
dication of what Hungarians believe
should be done with Serbia at the end
of tho war. It in tlioir itU'ii that
Austria-Hungary should retain strat-
Balkans' from again kindling a world
war.
"I personally do not believe4 that
tho Kiirajoviich dynasty which, for-
merly ruled Serbia, should return. "
continued Count Appenyi. "The Ka-
rageovitek rulers organized permanent
conspiracies against our safety,
minating in the assassination at Sara
jevo of the Archduke Ferdinand, the
act that jrecipitated the war. Wo
cannot tolerate such rule again. Fur
thermore, Bulgaria and Greece must be
constructed into efficient powers. Bul
garia must obtain her rights in Mace
donia. ' '
Count Appenyi believe peace is not
far distant.
"Before there can be effective steps
to bring peace, there must tie false
steps. The period we are passing
through now. The success of media
tion does not hinge on the personality
of the mediator, but upon the spirit
in which mediation js offered.
"Those who have been considered
as pos'ble- peaeemnkcrs-Presidenrt
Wilson, Pope Benedict, the King of
Spain and the Queen of Holland are
all welcomo as peacemakers, provid
ing they bring real fairness and impar
tiality and advocate terms which can
be accepted without our renouncing
the necessary aims of defensive war
fare. That means that we must have
enectivo guarantees for the future
safety of Europe.
"There is no doubt that we can
hold out until the coming harvest.
Then the economic situation will be
completely altered, making it evident
that we can not be starved into surren
dering. I do not think our enemies
any longor entertain hopes of military
success. We arc convinced of the ef
ficiency of the economic measures we
have taken -too, then the time will be
ripe for peace.

By Karl A. Blckel.

St. Louis, Juno' 13. "Enact the
Susa i B. Anthony amendment before

gress or fight. Half a million dollars
is available for the fight."
This is the ultimatum that will be
handed tho resolutions committee of
he democratic national committee by a
delegation of the national womuu's
party on Thursday. The woman's party
will not ask that a plank favoring
suffrage be placed in the democratic
platform. They state that "favorubln
mention" by tho democrats has no at
traction for them. They are putting it
up squarely to the Wilson administra
tion to translate any friendly feeling
that it has into terms of definite action
by taking the Susan B. Anthony amend
ment cut of the hands of the judiciary
committee immediately and passing it.
This emendment to the national consti
tutio.i puts the question of nation-wide
equal suffrage up to the states for
npprovnl. In taking this attitude the
women's party is favoring "direct ac
tion" as against the plan of the Na

lutions committee of the democratic

Market Was Spirited
and Rather Reactionary
New York, Juno 13. Tho New York
Evening Sun financial review today
said:
Wall Street was disposed to attribute
the spiritless and somewhat reaction
ary stock market of todny to tho
Mexican situation and to the confer
ence of tho railroad managers and the
union leaders, both of which, but more
particularly the former assumed some
what disturbing aspects. Washington
made no secret of a feling of appre
hension over the difficulties which aro
multiplying along tho southern frontier,
as is evidenced by the strengthening
of the American forces in that direc
tion. But while these features served as
an explanation for tho unsatisfactory
prico movement, the undeniable fact
remains that yesterday's upturn de
veloped heavy profit taking, of which
the market felt som e effects and
these were nccontuated no doubt by
the further fact thut Monday's deal
ings were largely professional. Tho
nomination of Mrs. Hughes, while a
matter of great satisfaction to the
financial district, did not stimulate
fresh buyng.
First prices indicated no important
chnngo in either direction, but the rail
way issues under the leadership of
New York Central wero firm.
Mexican Petroleum was weak due to
the trend of affairs south of tho Rio

"In the suffrage states are 01 elec
