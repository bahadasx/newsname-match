Caio Sells, of Texas, said, "Wo
ought to get 'inn rank and file of the
Progressives. Apparently the party
may cease its existence. The mem
bers are bitter over the treatriient
they received from certain of their
leaders. The bitterness is acute among
the leaders who were Progressives in
1!H2 because they "believed in the plat
form. They have a chance !n otU' par-
tv." ...

( Chickasha Man; Lodge Pro
voked Near Stampede
Wilh a smile of dimensions com
mensurate with the occasion, J. W,
Kay Her landed in Chickasha yesterday
from Chicago and the Hughes victory.
The smile, whieh-won't-conie-off-until-
ber vurl0l nc,oini,unle, him down
J town this morning and was found

"Yes," Mr. Kayser said this morn-
l ing, "the Republican convention, just)
past, will be one long remembered by
all who attended it. It showed several
thiajf8( c.hIf of wUi(.h was that Koose.
volt delayed just a little too long in
his effort to name the man who should
lead the. Republicans this fall.
'While 1 do not think it possible for
Mr. Roosevelt to have, under any cir
cumstances, gained enough strength to
have secured the nomination for him
self, yet I believe that hud he made
the attempt two days earlier than he
did he could have ko far dominated
the convention that ho could have
named the eamlidnie.
"Roosevelt hud Chicago behind him;
everything was for Teddy; the news
papers were all Teddy sheets; the pic
ture bhows carried Teddy pictures and
scenes from Teddy's career;' the,
bands played Teddy marches; the bar
tenders mixed Teddy cocktails; the
girls In the cabarets forgot the tango
to dance Teddy steps; the galleries
were filled from morning to night and
from night to morning with Teddy
boosters; the hotel lobbies were filled
with Teddy spell-binders in fui;t Ted
dy won there wfth the goods in every
thing except tho votes."
When asked where he thought the
Progressive vote would go following
the possible disruption, brought about
through Roosevelt's deflection, Mr.
Kayser said that he believed that all
except the most radical of the four
million who left the Republican party
and followed the cause of the Bull
Moose in 1912, would return to the
fold and cast their votes for Hughes.
Mr. Kayser stated that he could not
attempt to name any "feature" of the
convention, that the "big doings" was
filled with features. He likened the
convention to a big game of poker at
which the trained politicians held the
cards and knew how to play them.
The speech of Henry Cabot Lodge was
a feature, Mr. Kayser said, and when,
upon roll call, Lodge changed his vote
to Roosevelt and the Pennsylvania
delegation followed suit, the.-: was
the nearest approach recorded to
stampeding the convention.
The most masterful piece of orato

Mayor Puts Ban on Puhlic Speaking on
Chickasha Avenue; Says Spielers
Must Move Plants to '
Side Streets
Mayor Coffman has issued his ulli
matum. Elaborating tho scriptural
adage of "Thou shall not," the mayor
says in words "Thoir slialt not, under
any circumstances whatsoever, turn
Chickasha avenue into cither a pulpit
or a political debating auditorium."
"Chickasha avenue in years gone by
has been an assembling place for all
entertaining divergent religious and
political views. This has got to be
stopped right now. The general pub
lic of Chickasha doesn't care a whoop
whal a man's religious, political or
peace-at-any-price or preparedness
views may be. The public comes
down town and walks down Chickasha
avenue, bent on business, and each
unit doesn't want to have to step out
into the middle of the avenue and butt
streets cars out of his way in order
(o get around a bunch who are argu
ing about whether the f. W. W. or
the Bull Moose will become the ruling
power. No one cares a copper wheth
er Eugene Debs or Teddy Roosevelt
represents the salvation of the coun
try and no one cares to listen to some
street gospel vendor expressing his
views upon the ultimate arrival of the
end of the world.
"Hence I want it distinctly under
stood that henceforth, from this min
ute on, any one who wishes to con
vert the general public to his or her
views upon the political situation, the
European war or the parables of the
sacred writings, must do so on some
side street. What side street may be
selected does not matter, but Chicka
sha avenue must not be used as a po
litical debating ground oi as an inde.
pendent pulpit."

DEMENTED MAN r
SENT TO ASYLUM
Carl Koerber, recently adjudged ot
unsound mind by the county insanity
board, was transferred to the asylum
at Norman, R. P. Lindsay, speelal dep
uty, leaving Chickasha with hitn at 11
o'clock this morning.
Koerber seriously objected to his
removal to the Norman asylum, stat
ing he had "served one term there,"
and adding that the officials of th
asylum had run him off and told him
that they would sorely klll the next
officer who brought him there. He
expressed a desire to be taken "back
to Leavenworth," saying "they know
how to treat a fellow up there."
Koerber seems to be a very craiv
man at times and has apparently con
tracted a very pronounced dislike for
Jailer Dryden. Today was the date
the insane man had set aside to "skin
the jailer's head." but decided at th
last moment to postpone that openk
tion provided he be permitted to buy
a new straw hat to replace the old
one which he had torn up a few days
since. The permission was granted.
