Stanford Co-ed Is
Getting Ready for
Jaunt Into Arctic
SEATTLE. June 11. —Grizzled
Vilhjalmur Stelnnssnn is goinfc to
peer over the top o' the world
some fine morning and see —
Miss Anita Allen, co-ed.
And it's not unlikely that he
will kick over a few icebergs and
jump nil and down like the North
ern lights.
Anita, the best looking 20-year
old member of Delta Gamma so
rority at Stanford university, is
in Seattle getting ready to make
a dash beyond the Arctic circle to
see Vilhjalmur.
She is going with Capt. Louis
Lane and a crew of millionaire
whale hunters on the schooner
Great Hear, now being completed
at Eagle Harbor, to the land of
the blonde Eskimos, around Point
Marrow and Ranks Land.
Hope to Find Explorer.
Kxplorer Stefansson, It must be
explained, has been up there for a
couple of years.
Capt. Dane hopes to find him
when the ice breaks this summer.
Miss Allen, with her aunt. Mrs.
Capt. I.ane, was at the Washing
ton annex yesterday digging
through a pile of maps.
The young lady looked all ready
for anything but harpooning
whales and shooting walruses.
She was dressed in white from
her throat to her toes.
Mother Is Not Worried.
She Is the dainty, smiling, girl
ish, campus type.
Her home is in Palo Alto and
she is the daughter of Mrs. Theo
philus Allen, who Is not the least
bit worried about Mlse Allen's ad
venturous cruise.
So says Anita, at least.
"I haven't any Idea being of
any use to a party of traders and
hunters and explorers," confessed
Anita, "hut they have insisted
that I go along. I'm not holding
that against them. Any one
would like to go up there where
no white girl has ever been be
fore."
Will Keep lingular Diary.
A typewriter, she explained, will
be hers to pound, week In and
