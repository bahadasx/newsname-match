dtnt Wilson making his first address
since the Presidential campaign to- ;
day discussed preparedness, militar
ism. Americanism, the causes of the j
war in Europe, peace, the Monroe j
Doctrine, divided allegiance, and the |
ideals of America. He declared it is j
the present imperative duty of the
I'nited States to be prepared, adding
• mankind Is going to know that when 1
America speaks she means what she
says."
The President said the United
States should not be a blustering na
tion, a nation with a "chip on its
shoulder" but a calm nation, which
will hold its hand as long as possible
and strike only for victory.
The President's address ran through
the almost entire list of subjects dis
cussed by former Justice Hughes in
his telegram accepting the Republican
nomination and he declared the United
States is ready to join with other na- >,
tions to see that the kind of justice it
believes in is given.
Should Set Ksample
Shaking his finger emphatically the
President told the graduates of the
Military Academy and a large audience j
that, nobody who does not put Amer- !
lea first can be tolerated. He added, j

By Associated Press
1 St. Louis, Mo., June 13.—Delegates
to the Democratic national convention,
which opens here at noon to-morrow,
I appeared to be interested in two ques
i tions to-day. One was whether Vice-
I President Marshall would be renomi
! nated by acclamation or whether the
favorite sons would insist upon their
! names going before the convention for
a ballot. The other was the probable
action of the delegates with regard to
! the demand of the suffragists for an
: unequivocal declaration in the plat-
I form in favor of equal rights.
Sentiment for the renominatlon of
j Vice-President Marshall appeared so
» strong to-day, leaders said, that there
was talk among them of starting a
movement to have him named without
going through the formality of taking
a ballot. The talk of naming Secre
j tary of War Baker for the second place
on the ticket ended almost as suddenly
as it started. The war secretary had
much to do with putting the quietus

city that he was for Marshall and that

The fact that Mr. Baker had just
left President Wilson when he an
nounced that he ta\ ©red Mr. Marshall
for renomination also gave support to
the idea of ha\ing Mr. Marshall ac
claimed the candidate without calling |
the roll. It was saiil that Governor
John F. Moorelend of Nebraska, may
withdraw his .name as a candidate for

To Inspect Perry Roads

After an inspection of Perry county j

lives* of the board of governors of •
the William Penn Highway will at- j
tend a meeting in the borough build
ing in Newport, at which the claims
oi rival route boomers will be heard. .
I William Jennings, president of the i
liighwr.y association, and jr. H. James, (
'secretary, will go to Perry county!
Thursday noon.
Perry county people have different
ideas as to the logical William Penn
route through that county. The Liver
pool ro'ite has its advocates, who say j
the highway may be permanently im- ■
proved at a less cost than any other. !
The Newport boomers point to the
fact that by passing through Newport i
the William Penn route will be ten or
twelve miles shorter than the Liver- j
poci way. Then there are other roads
enthusiasts who want the routes
through their neighborhood. Mr.!
Jennin-s and Mr. James will cover all
the possible thoroughfares Thursday
afternoon. At 7 o'clock the meeting l
in the Newport borough building will ;
;be held. It has been called by J. G. j

HUGHES' ATTITUDE
"IS OF UNDILUTED
AMERICANISM"
Tells Newspapermen He Is For
an Out and Out Amer
ican Policy
POLITICAL FRIENDS CALL
Leaders Confer With Candi
date Upon Arrangements
For Campaign
By Associated Press
New York. June 13. Charles E.
Hughes, In response to questions put
to him to-day by newspapermen in re
gard to his attitude toward the sup
port offered him by the German-
Americans, said it was "one of un
diluted Americanism."
"1 stated my position very clearly,"
said the Republican presidential can
didate, "in my telegram to the conven
tion. My atttiude is one of undiluted
Americanism, and any body that sup
ports me is supporting an out and out
American and an out and out Ameri
can polity, absolutely nothing else."
Mr. Hughes dictated his statement
of "undiluted Americanism" in re
sponse to repeated requests of inter
views and ih the face of his previously
announced determination to say noth
ing further on the issues of the day
until his formal notification of nomi
nation. He met the correspondents by
appointment and after discussing his
plans informally for a few minutes
dictated the statement standing in a
group of about forty newspapermen
and other callers.
It was the only statement he made
during his talk with newspapermen
that he would permit to go out as au
thorized by him.
Will Soon Start Tours
At the same time, it was made clear
to callers that the nominee had used
>vhat he thought was the most em
phatic language he could have used
on this subject in his telegram last
Saturday to Chairman Harding of the
Republican national convention. Lead
ers at the Hughes headquarters ap
parently were genuinely surprised that
doubt should have remained as to the
nominee's attitude on this point.
Mr. Hughes, it was said, intends to
meet this doubt, now that it has been
raised. In a manner which he believes
will dear it up and place him in a
light which cannot possibly be mis
understood. It will be a long cam
paign and a strenuous campaign, ac
cording to the present outlook at
headquarters and there will be ample
opportunity it is felt, between now
ami November to go into details on
every issue before the American peo
ple. This the nominee Intends to do,
headquarters leaders announced.
The nominee, they said, probably
vill start early on his speechmaking
tours.
Will Not Discuss Suffrage
Indications were to-day that Mr.
Hughes would remain In New York
until he begins his speechmaking
lours, with the exception of his con
templated visit to Brown University.
The procession of visitors began
early in the forenoon and kept Mr.
Hughes busy. Mr. Hughes was the
recipient to-day of a varied assort
ment of luck tokens from all parts of
the country.
Suffragists sought unsuccessfully
during the day to interview Mr.
Hughes as to his attitude toward their
cause. Mr. Hughes sent out word
that he would not discuss the subject
