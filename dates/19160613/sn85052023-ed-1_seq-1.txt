To His Death In Aero
plane at Pensacola
TRYING FOR NEW RECORD
FOR CONTINUED FLIGHT WHEN
PART OF MACHINE PROVED
DEFECTIVE BURIED
HERE MONDAY.
Eleven years ago a Stanford moth
er gave her youngest son to the ser
vice of his country.
Friday, June 9, he gave it his life.
And yesterday the bruised and
broken remains .of what less than a
week before had been as stalwart,
as noble, and as brave a Kentuckian
as ever the old state has sent forth
in all her history, were brought back
to his childhood's home here in Stan
ford; returned by his country to the
mother who had given him, and 'mid
broken hearts and with lender hands
were laid to final rest on the green
hillside of Buffalo Springs cemetery,
beside his illustrious sire and others
of his blood.
Shattered though the mortal frame
had been, of what was so splendid
a young man, no accident of fate,
as caused his sudden taking, can
ever tarnish the brilliant record he
has made during the all too brief
period of service to his country. The
grief of his mother and whose can
be greater? and the sorrow of his
wife and other loved ones, seems ov
erwhelming in this hour of great af
fliction, and such that God in His
infinite mercy only can assuage.
But there are rifts in every lower
ing cloud, and through the gloom
and through the shadows of their
sorrow, will ever gleam the ray of
God's sunlight, proclaiming the sa
cred honor of having borne such a
son, having loved such a husband, or
having known such a friend, and
illuminating, so that all the
world may see, his deathless deeds
of heroism, of courage, of self-sacrifice,
of honor and devotion to the
cause of the flag he loved and for
which he lived and died.
Stanford, Lincoln county, Ken
tucky, aye, the nation, are losers in
the death of Lieutenant Richard Cas
well Saufley which occurred last Fri
day afternoon about 1 o'clock, when
the aeroplane in which he was flying,
fell to the earth, near Pensaloca,
Fla. The news received here late that
afternoon was received with expres
sions of deepest sorrow all over the
city and county, and all over the
state. His friends and loved ones
here were inexpressibly shocked,
while the blow to his aged mother,
who was visiting her daughter, Mrs.
S. M. Logan, at Midway, was almost
unbearable. He was her youngest
son; the baby of her heart and home;
and today her gray hairs are bowed
.down in anguish before the affliction
which has been visited upon her. A
world of loved ones are praying that
her Heavenly Father will grant her
strength to bear this, the latest of a
series of bereavements which have
been visited upon her and hers with
in a period of a few short years.
No Way to Learn the Cause.
The exact cause of the fearful ac
cident which caused the death of
Lieut. Saufley will probably never be
known. It has been the history of
aviation, of flying in heavier-than-air
machines that, except in acci
dents where the pilot is not.immedi
ately killed, or where a full and com
plete observation can be made from
watchers below, it is impossible to
ascertain what was the defect in the
machine that caused it to fall. The
Associated Press dispatches from
Pensacola, Florida, where is located
the United States Aviation Station,
of which Lieut. Saufley was Instruc
tor and Chief Aviator, told the fol
lowing story of his death:
"Pensacola, Fla., June 10. De
.claring when he left the hanger at
the Pensacola aeronautic station
-at 4 o'clock Friday morning that
he was going to outdo his previous
record of eight hours of continu
ous flight in a Curtis hydroplane,
Lieut. Richard Caswell Saufley
kept soaring in continuous "flight
until shortly after 1 o'clock Fri
day afternoon when his machine,
while brother aviators were look
ing at his daring and record-
breaking flight, suddenly tipped
and began to fall from a height of
possibly 800 feet. Downward to
Santa Rosa Island the falling ma
chine and aviator plunged; but
when about fifty to sixty feet
from the earth Saufley appeared
to gain control of the machine,
for it righted itself just for a sec
ond, then appeared to tumble over
because of something giving way.
The machine and aviator fell with
a crash. Saufley was dying when
aid reached him. Both legs were
broken, his arm and chest were
crushed in and his body fearfully
bruised. Just what caused the
machine to take a tumble will nev
er be known. It was a practically
new airship and had plenty of test
ing before the ascent. A board
was named to investigate, the
cause of the accident. This con
sists of Lieuts. Whiting, Bellinger
and Spencer, each of the mavia
tors, and witnesses to the fall of
Saufley's machine."
The Pensacola Journal Saturday
morning, June 10, told the following
story of the fatal accident:
"Seeking to break his own
world record for sustained hydro
aeroplane flight, made only last
Tuesday, Lieutenant Richard C.
Saufley took the air yesterday
mo,rning at half past four and
soared over Santa Rosa Sound and
Island.
The air he had found on his
previous flight, was exceptionally
still and smooth there.
The day was ideal for flights,
and all was going well. To the
watchers on earth, it was merely
a matter of routine. Saufley, one
of the world's masters of aeronau
tics, had said he was going to
break his record of eight hours
and five minutes sustained flight,
and was simply a matter of letting
the clock go round. The regular
drone of the engine told he was
not having the engine trouble that
drove him back to earth the last
time.
Suddenly the machine took a
plunge. Saufley was soaring at a
height of five hundred feet at the
time; the watchers knew there was
no reason foi this maneuver. In
the flash of a second the flight be
came incredibly but a sigh of re
lief went up as the plane straight
ened out on an even keel again.
.Then suddenly it dropped
headlong, spinning, and crumbled
to trash on Santa Rosa Island, op
posite the station.
Two physicians were rushed to
the spot in aeroplanes, and found
Saufley buried beneath the wreck
age. Death had been instantane
ous. If Saufley beat his former rec
ord it was by a few seconds, as
he fell at about one o'clock.
The Cause.
An investigating committee,
consisting of Lieutenant Kenneth
Whiting and Junior Lieutenants P.
N. Bellinger and Earl W. Spen
cer, was immediately appointed to
ascertain if possible, the cause of
the disaster. Their findings are
not made public, but are for the
navy department alone.
The machine was of a modern
type, had been prepared especially
for the endurance flight, and was
in good condition. Judging from
the way the machine behaved, a
broken tail was the cause of the
accident.
The second and fatal drop was
from a distance of probably fifty
feet. Had the machine been over
the water, Saufley's life might
have been saved.
Government Appreciated His Work.
That his remarkable work and suc
cess in the newest branch of the na
tion's military service was amply un
derstood and appreciated by the gov
ernment at Washington, is fully in
dicated by a special dispatch from
Washington, which said:
"Washington, June 10. The
aeroplane service of the United
States Navy sustained a great loss
Friday when one of its most ex
perienced aviators, Lieut. Richard
Caswell Saufley, of Stanford, Ky.,
holder of several world's records,
was killed in a flight at the naval
flying station at Pensacola, Fla.
A dispatch to the Navy Depart
ment stated that aeroplane A.H.9,
in which he was flying, fell with
the aviator and that the accident
was due to the machine in some
way having damaged tails. Fly
ing for Lieut. Saufley amounted
almost to a positive genius, ac
cording to naval officers who knew
him. He had been stationed at
Pensacola all winter, engaged in
experimental and research work
and training younger aviators for
the navy. Last December in the
aeroplane A-H-8, with another of
ficer as an observer, he made a
sixty-mile scouting trip over the
Gulf of Mexico from Pensacola, in
the first of a series of naval scout
ing experiments. In the same
month he broke a second altitude
record at Pensacola, when flying
alone, he achieved an altitude of
12,135 feet. On a previous flight,
with a passenger, he made an alti
tude of 8,340 feet. These were
both world's records for hydroaer
oplanes and were made in Curtis
hydroaeroplanes. Last March he
attained an altitude of 16,072 feet
in a similar machine. Saufley dur
ing the winter also made a series
of successful flights from the deck
of a warship in an aeroplane that
was launched from a catapault."
Judge Saufley's Youngest Son.
Caswell Saufley, as he was known
and called by everyone here at
"home," was the youngest child of
the late Judge M. C. Saufley, who
died in 1910, while just entering up
on his third term as Circuit Judge
of this district. Mis mother, Mrs.
Sallie Rowan Saufley survives, as
well as the following brothers and
sisters: Deputy Internal Revenue
Collector H. Rowan Saufley, and
Mrs. George L. Penny, of this city,
Mrs. T. S. Webb, of Knoxville, Tenn.,
Mrs. Sanford M. Logan, of Midway,
and James M. Saufley, of Sunbright,
Tenn. He is also survived by his
wife, who is a daughter of Judge
and Mrs. E. C. O'Rear, of Frank
fort, and to whom he was married
in April, 1911.
Saufley was born in Stanford,
September 1, 1885. After attend
ing the old school "on the hill" here,
he entered Centre College at Dan
ville, and early in his college days
gave evidence of those studious and
brilliant traits of mind, which dis
tinguished his every endeavor after
ward. He was prominent in athlet
ics in college; popular with his fellow
students; as proud as Lucifer, yet I
as gentle as a woman and as game
as a pebble always. He belonged to
the Sigma Chi fraternity.
In college he soon showed marked
oratorical ability, and gained the
rare distinction of winning the hon
or, while only a Sophomore, of rep
resenting his school in the intercol
legiate oratorical contest; he also
won the Sophomore Watch awarded
for scholarship in Latin.
In his Junior year, the late Con
gressman George G. Gilbert offered
him an appointment as Midshipman
at the United States Naval Academy
at Annapolis, which he accepted and
left college to begin his studies in
the greatest naval training school in
the world, from which he graduated
four years later. He attained high
grade in all of the studies which the
government requires as requisite for
its young officers, but seemed espe
cially gifted in languages and in the
mastery of international law, lead
ing his class in the latter study and
taking second rank in French, to a
native born Frenchman, and these
in a class of 308 students.
His proficiency in French caused
him to be the recipient of an unu
sual and distinguished honor, while
yet one of the youngest Ensigns in
the naval service, and just fresh
from school. The Atlantic fleet, of
which the battleship Kansas to which
he was attached was one, cruising off
the European coast stopped at Brest,
France, and the citizens of that city
entertained the ..officers and men of
the warship with an elaborate ban
quet. The Mayor of Brest deliver
ed an ornate address of welcome to
his American guests, and young Sau
fley, only 24 years of age, was se
lected to respond on behalf of the
fleet, which he did, in French, to the
delight and intense and enthusias
tic appreciation of their hosts and
the many Americans present.
Sought Aviation Duty.
After service on the battleship
Kansas, he was transferred to the
command of a torpedo boat destroy
er, where he rendered very efficient
service, and after that went on
board the battleship North Carolina,
which later was converted into the
official carrier and experimental ship
of the aviation department of the
navy. When the formal Aviation
Corps of the navy was organized,
there were several hundred officers
of the navy volunteered for this
most dangerous branch of the ser
vice. . Only three were to be chosen
at first and these three, because of
superior records they had made as
students of naval affairs, engineer
ing, and general efficiency. Out of
the many who sought these assign
ments, Caswell Saufley was one of
the three selected, and at once he
DIED IN HIS COUNTRY'S CAUSE
Lieut. Richard Caswell Saufley.
justified in every way the confidence
which the department heads had
vested in him. He devoted all of
the wonderful energy and talent of
his trained mind, and indomitable
courage, to mastery of the new sci
ence of flying, and became very pro
ficient and expert, yet very cautious.
All with whom he ever conversed of
the work of his profession were im
pressed with the manifest enthusi
asm he felt for his work, and yet
with his realization of its extreme
hazards, and of the need for con
stant vigilance and caution. When
here on a short furlough during the
Christmas holidays, only a few
months ago, he told the writer his
cousin that ninety per cent of the
accidents to aeroplanes arfdvi'Kbrs'
were caused by recklessness on the
part of the pilot, ambitious to per
form some daredevil deed, or taking
foolish and needless chances; and
that if ever he was the victim of
such, it would be from fault of the
machine he was flying and not
through the taking of any such
chances on his part. The dispatches
from Pensacola, bear out the state
ment that he was considered most
cautious and most reliable, and his
death was undoubtedly caused by
the fault of the machine and none
of his own.
Made Record In Mexico.
When Uncle Sam first took a hand
actively in Mexican affairs and Ve
ra Cruz was occupied by American
soldiers in 1914, the flying machines
were sent down into that troubled
land, and Lieut. Saufley with them.
There he gained quick distinction by
being the first American aviator to
fly over hostile camps, and the first
to draw a map of foreign territory
from the air, high up in a flying ma
chine. He was fired upon a number
of times by the Mexicans, but was
not deterred from his duty and steer
ing and controlling his machine with
his right hand, with his left hana,
he mapped the territory and shifted
his sheets with his teeth. The first
moving pictures of Uncle Sam's aer
oplanes were taken there, and friends
of Saufley over the country, here
and elsewhere, saw him in action on
The screens.
Promoted to Instructor.
Returning to Pensacola, Florida,
where the permanent aviation base
was soon afterward established,
Lieut. Saufley was placed in charge
of its instruction department, and in
this work he was engaged at the time
of his death. Dispatches quoted
above tell of the records he had
made and the great work he had
done. He stood at the head of his
profession. He wrote several works
relating to it which were adopted as
standards of the service by the navy
department. Further honors, higher
rank and greater recognition were
all before him; his ambition was lim
itless; he thought big thoughts; he
planned deeds of high emprise, and
saw before the branch of the service
with which he was identified, the all
important part it is to play in the
military affairs of this "country just
as the aeroplane service has done
with the nations of Europe.
But he was the true soldier and
realized the hazards of his life and
work and "was ready and unafraid
to die when the call came as so
soon and suddenly it did. How the
heart chords tighten and quiver and'glected by one country when other
ache when one thinks of the 'great countries are developing-it constant-
and losing fight which this splendid
young man fought up there in the
air of a beautiful summer's after
noon off old Pensacola bay! Falling,
falling, to his death; knowing that
somewhere, somehow in the machine
which, under his skilful hand, was
almost human a vital part had giv
en away; he strained, and labored
and fought with his great brain and
mighty brawn, his heart of steel,
his nerve of iron; fought for his life,
and lost, simply because of man's
impotence and because of God's om
nipotence. Yet who will say that he has lost?
"On Fame's eternal camping ground
His silent tent is spread.
And Glory guards with solemn round
The Bivouac of the Dead."
"Sleep on embalmed and sainted
dead,
Dear as the blood ye gave,
No impious footstep here shall tread
The herbage of your grave."
"Nor shall thy glory be forgot
While fame her record keeps,
Nor honor points the hallowed spot
Where Valor proudly sleeps."
HUNDREDS PAY TRIBUTE
AT DEAD OFFICER'S BIER.
Wrapped in the service flag of the
Battleship North Carolina upon
which he first saw aviation duty, the
body of Lieut. Saufley was lowered
into its grave at Buffalo Springs
Cemetery here Monday afternoon.
Full military honors were paid as
a last tribute to the memory of the
gallant young Kentuckian, at the
Naval Station at Pensacola, before
the widow started northward with the
remains of her loved one. The of
ficers and crew of the North Caroli
na, and all sailors and aviators at
the post attended the service, and
the guns of the warship boomed out
the officer's full salute as the cor
tege moved from the scene of his
earthly triumphs to entrain for his
old Kentucky home.
Accompanied by his widow, her
father, Judge E. C. O'Rear and bro
ther, James O'Rear, the body reach
ed Stanford on the 11:49 L. & N.
train Monday imorning. It 'Wag-met
at the depot by hundreds of friends
and loved ones. It was then taken to
the Presbyterian church, where it
lay in state, garbed in the snow
white and gold dress uniform of his
rank. Probably the most mgnificent
display of floral tributes ever seen
at a funeral in Stanford, made a
frame of rare beauty about the bier,
and overflowing upon the altar and
chancel of the church, mutely and
beautifully testified to the regard
and esteem in which the young man
was held by all who knew him.
Up until the hour of the service
at 2.30 those who had known and
loved him here in youth, and others
who were admirers of his knightly
courage and deeds, quietly with bow
ed head passed by the bier for a
last view of his earthly countenance.
The church was crowded to its ca
pacity at 2:30 when the brief fun
eral service was held. "Some Day
We'll Understand," was touchingly
sung by a quartet composed of Miss
Elizabeth Higgins, Mrs. J. G. Car
penter, George D. Hopper and T. D.
Raney. Rev. S. M. Logan of Midway,
read a passage of Scripture, Rev. P.
L. Bruce, made a few appropriate
remarks, and Rev. W. D. Welburn
led in prayer. "God Will Take Care
of You" was sung by the choir and
prayer by Rev. Bruce concluded the
service at the church. The pallbear
ers were young men who had been
his boyhood schoolmates at the old
school "on the hill" and were Messrs.
James T. Menefee, of Knoxville,
Tenn., E. D. Pennington, E. R.
Coleman, W. P. Logan, R. B. Woods
and J. W. Rochester. A prayer by
Rev. Bruce at the grave concluded
the formal ceremonies.
HENRY WATTERSON'S TRIBUTE
The Louisville Courier-Journal
Sunday morning had the following
as its first editorial:
A State's Bereavement.
The navy's loss in the death of
Lieut. Richard Caswell Saufley, of
the aeronautic service, is Kentucky's
bereavement.
The aviation service claims the
bravest and the ablest young men of
the army and navy. They incur in
times of peace greater risk of life
than is encountered upon the firing
line by infantrymen, cavalrymen or
artillerymen in times of war. Unlike
the aeronauts of the aviation field,
where flying is an exhibition purely,
they risk their lives as soldiers, and
not as showmen. They are engaged
in solving many problems of practi
cal aviation, a branch of military and
naval service- which cannot be ne-
ly toward higher efficiency. The loss
of an experienced aviator, such as
Caswell Saufley was, means to the
service the loss of a peculiarly use
ful officer. To Kentucky, in this case,
it means more. It means the un
timely death of a young Kentuckian,
of an honored stock, whose mettle
was that of the best blood of the
South in the Sixties when the warp
of chivalric ideals woven with the
woof of tragedy and sorrow fash
ioned the fabric of history in which
the soldier shone as an example of
knightly courage, and war was made
a real romance. His spirit was that
which at an earlier period gave the
dark and bloody ground in the days
of Boone, in the War of '12 and in
the Mexican War immortal fame.
The circumstance that he did not fall
in action does not make him less a
patriot or a hero than soldiers and
sailors who sacrifice their lives on
the actual field of battle.
The accident brings grief to two
families whose pride was centered
in the achievements of the daring
young officer. It brings a widow's
weeds to a young matron hardly be
yond girlhood. The burden and the
blight of war which have been borne
by mothers and wives since the bale
fires burned on Trojan walls, have
fallen frequently during peace since
aviation has become a feature of
preparedness. Kentucky has lost
two sons recently in the service,
Elisha Kelly, of Louisville, and now
Caswell Saufley, of Stanford. In
both cases the loss has been felt
keenly by all the people of the
State.
The risks of aviation are inevita
ble. Whether they are greater in
the American army and navy than
they should be is a question often
discussed. The Courier-Journal, pos
sessing no technical knowledge of
aeroplanes, and having no intimate
knowledge as to the conditions under
which American aviators make expe
riments does not feel qualified to
pass judgment, but is moved to say
that so far as it has progressed army
and navy aviation has taken a dis
tressing toll of valuable lives and
that Kentucky has sustained dis
tressing losses.
Our profound sympthy and sorrow
go out to the noble mother and the
stricken wife.
FROM SECRETARY OF THE NAVY
Mrs. Saufley received the follow
ing telegram from Secretary of the
Navy Josephus Daniels, of Washing
ton: "The death of your husband caus
es me profound grief. The Aviation
Service could receive no more severe
blow, for his genius in the sense of
flight combined with his caution and
general good judgment marked him
as a real leader."
KILLED ON MOTORCYCLE
John Marshall Cloyd, who gradu
ated from Central University, at
Danville last week, met a fearful
death Friday, when the motorcycle
on which he was riding to his home
at Campbellsville, was struck by a
train near Lebanon. The young man
played center field on the C. U. ball
team which played Stanford High a
few weeks ago. He was an especial
friend of Spalding Hill, of this city
and rode with him and Misses Isa
bella Givens, of Shelby City section,
aind Henrietta Rogers in the carni
val parade. At the Senior banquet
he responded to the toast "O, Grave,
Where is Thy Victory?" He was a
son of Judge and Mrs. J. W. Cloyd,
of Taylor county, and a fine young
man in every way. He was struck
by a passenger train at the Veatch
crossing a mile east of Lebanon. He
died three hours later at the hospital
in Lebanon. At the point the pike is
almost parallel with the railroad be
fore it crosses and it is supposed that
the noise of his motorcycle prevent
ed him hearing the approach of the
train.
Packard, one can't overstate his
worth. In his line, he is certainly the
best we have seen. His audience will
laugh until they arc on the very col
lapse, then they are rescued and lift
ed to plains of moral vision which
they never want to forsake.
Respectfully,
A. J. CLERE.
I, had the pleasure of hearing
Judge George D. Alden lecture in
Shelbyville two years ago on the
"Needs of The Hour." I can truly
say it was one of the finest lectures
to which I have ever listened, indeed
he is considered one of the most
popular lecturers on the platform.
Judge Alden is not only an orator
but a poet and is clean and clear
cut. He is a lawyer and is from Mass
achusetts and is a son of the May
Flower Pilgrims and Puritans. To
my mind this lecture is worth the
,price paid for the season ticket.

Dear Madam I was sorry to be
unable to see you yesterday with ref
erence to your chautauqua program.
I happen to know of the men who
are to lecture for you; namely.
Judge Alden and Mr. Packard. They
are first class men and their lectures
will be well worth the price of the
