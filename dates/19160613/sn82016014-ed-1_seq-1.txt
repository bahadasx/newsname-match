St. Louis, June 13. Kansas Demo
crats may fight at home. Senator
Thompson may really dislike Hodges
out in Kansas. The scars from the
Orr-Sapp fight may not have healed
in the voting precincts m the sun-
flower state. But here in St. Louis j
on the eve of a national convention,
when a, president is to be renominated
and everything and everyone is to be
ratified, endorsed and commended ;
li mocrarv rven ammi? Kansas dele
pates is as solid and close and firmly
established as the inntr organization
of the Standard Oil company.
Kvrry Democrat from Kansas and
there are more than 100 of them now
on the job is looking with a lantern
f r some small opportunity to show
his lovaltv to the national administration-
U is born of that hope which
is eternal in the breast of every poli
tician. For there is no Democrat
from Kansas who does not realize that
hope of postoffice, federal appoint
ments and standing in the party is
based on the success of the Wilson
administration in November. It makes
nu difference whether a Democrat
fought Sapp in the Hutchinson state
convention. It is a matter of no
concern whether a Kansas Bourdon
.as for Hodges or Biliard in 1? 1 4.
Now everyone is for Wilson and the
way Kansan delegates and patronage
favorites are seeking opportunities to
show party loyalty is a real feature
of the convention which opens in St.
Louis Wednesday noon.
Housed at the Jefferson.
Kansas delegates spent Monday
ni-ht in the lobi-ies of the hotels. Most
of them slept at the Maryland, but
over at the Jefferson the delegation
had rented real expensive quarters.
They had gone to such lengths in their
display of party loyalty as to employ a
sign painter to properly designate tne
quarters. But sometime, somehow
someone had lost the key. When Kan
sas visitors went to the quarters Mon
day nigat they were as dark and
deserted as the tombs. This morning
the rooms were dusted and swept and

Democratic I
national committeeman for Kansas,
bfgan the task which last week caused
Kred Stanley of Wichita to lose
sleep during the Republican conven
tion. It was the little task of distrib
uting 200 tickets to 300 or 400 persons.
To be sure the St. Louis convention
is a ratification meeting. There are
none of the deep laid political
schemes' and maneuvers which char
acterized the Republican convention.
But the loyal and faithful from Kan
sas are here just as strong and just
bs enthusiastically as though the re- j
suits of the gathering depended on
their personal attendance and political
t-aracity. Anyway, maybe President
Wilson will want a list of the per
rons who attended the convention.
And how embarrassed would be the
internal revenue collector and his staff !
if their names were not listed. Hence !
party loyalty and enthusiasm that ,
reigns supreme and brings a unani
mous report from the Kansas head
quarters that "we are for anything
and everything that Wilson wants."
And that means vice presidential
nominee, platform, chairman, key
noter, sergeant-at-arms. superintend
ent of ventilation and all other power
Henry Allen Is There.
Not nil of the visitors to the convention
are Kepublirans. though. Thero is Heury
J. Allen, of Wichita, for example. Alien
was oiip of the fprvent faithful pilots of
the T'ropresslve convention in fhifgo lst
wwk. Be is trying to forget the tragedy
that overtook the Bull Moose party in the
titv on the lake front and he came to St.
Louis to "write a piece for the paper."
Allen, with his $1K Panama hat in his
hand and his bald head shining as a beacon
light, stood for two hours Monday night,
in the Jefferson hotel lobby and thrilled a
delegation of suffrage workers. Allen
isn't so much as a delegate to the St. Louis
convention. He probably has very little
power with the men who will build the
I e.mocratic platform planks. But for two
hours Allen's counsel whs sought by the
suffrage workers and it was piven as freely
as the water from the spring.
Miss Mabel Vernon is one of the
thorns in the flesh of the Democrats
who came to St. Louis to say and write
nice things about the Democratic con
press and the Democratic president.
Miss Vernon has wiped from her mind
the memory of her experience before
the resolutions committee of the Re
publican convention. Miss Vernon
who in a very short space of tim
succeeded in getting Kansas club
women and suffrage workers at each
others throats, brought an entire suit
case full of trouble for the Democratic
party in general.
Takes Her Troubles to Sapp.
Having spent several months in
Kansas, Miss Vernon showed a prefer- J Wichita is a member of the commit
ence to the Kansas delegation. So she ,ee to nntify the president, while John
took some of her troubles to Colonel
Sapp. Brave as a lion and as erect
and resolute as a soldier. Colonel Sapp
looked Miss Vernon in the eyes and
told her he would talk it all over with
her tomorrow. Then Colonel Sapp
wound up the interview by telling
Miss Vernon that he thought she was
"a mishty nice girl." It was the same
statement Colonel Sapp made to hun
dreds of Kansas women during his
senatorial race two years ago. But
Mis Verncn wasn't in Kansas at that
time and besides well, mavbe Colonel
Sapp will work for the suffrage plank.
News for the Republicans came
when Henry Allen gave a statement
to the St. Louis press in which he de
clared he would support Hughes for

threatened to commit suicide if it
proved true that Orpet had trans

"As far as I am personally con-

port Mr. Hughes rather than vote for
some lesser leader of the Progressive
party." Allen is quoted as saying. Al
len believes his view is the view of a

that a declination of the nomination
of the Progressives by Colonel ftoose

the former third party voters and

St. Louis. June 13. William H.
Thompson, Tnited States senator, has
been elected as a member of the reso
lutions committee which will write the
national Democratic platform. Thomp
son was chosen today at a caucus of
the Kansas delegates. His election
was over the protest of W. F. Sapp,
national committeeman, although no
fight was made in the caucus.

elected to a place on the credentials

While no formal action was taken
by the delegates, word was passed
from the caucus that the Kansas dele

Miss Mabel Vernon will this after

Thompson and Committeeman Sapp

Hughes Takes Stand for Undi

G. 0. P. Candidate Holding
Conferences in Jfew York.
New York, June- 13. Charles E.
Hughes, in response to questions put
to him today by newspaper men in re
gard to his attitude toward the sup
port offered him by the German
Americans said it was "one of undilut
ed Americanism."
'I stated my position very clearly,"
said the Republican presidential can
didate, "in my telegram to the conven
tion. My attitude is one of undiluted
Americanism and anybody that sup
ports me is supporting an out-and-out
American and an out-and-out poycy,
absolutely nothing else."
Mr. Hughes dictated his statement
on "Undiluted Americanism" in re
sponse to repeated requests of inter
viewers and in the face of his pre
viously announced determination to
say nothing further of the issues of
the day until his formal notification
of the nomination. He met the cor

One of the first developments of the
day at Mr. Hughes headquarters was
an announcement by Latayette s.
Gleason, secretary of the Republican
national convention and also of the
New York state Republican commit
tee, which indicated that it will be
several days yet before any decision
is reached on the question of the man
who is to succeed Charles D. Hilles as
chairman of the Republican national
committee. Mr. Gleason said that
sub-committee of the national com
mittee, would, in a few days, call upon
the nominee to discuss the matter.
Several names were under considera
tion but one man's guess was as good
as another, he said, as to who would
be selected.
Another development was an
nourced from the candidate's head
quarters that moving pictures wouid
be employed to aid his campaign. It
is planned to throw on the screen
throughout the country pictures of
Mr. Hughes, "in order that the people
may again become familiar with
Charles E. Hughes because he has
been for so long a time virtually out
of public life." The screens will also
display important passages from Mr.
Hughes's telegram to the national
convention accepting the nomination.

WARNS AGAINST MILITARISM
Asserts World to Enow U. S.
Means What It Says.
Declares Europe War Xot Acci
dent; It Had to Come.
West Point, June 13. President
Wilson, making his first aduress sine
the presidential campaign began, to
day discussed preparedness, militar
ism, Americanism, the causes of the
war in Europe, peace, the Monroe doc
trine, divided allegiance, and the ideals
of America. He declared it is the
present imperative duty of the United
States to be prepared, adding, "Man
kind is going to know that when
America speaks she means what she
says."
The president said the United States
should not be a blustering nation, a
nation with "a chip on its shoulder."
but a calm nation which will with
hold its hands as long as possible and,
strike only for victory. The nresi-
dent's address ran through almost the
enure list of subjects discussed by for
mer justice Hughes in his teleeram
accepting the Republican nomination,
and he declared that the United States
is ready to join with other nations to
see that the kind of justice it believes
in is given.
Can't Tell WbatH Happen.
Shaking his finger emphatically the
president told the graduates of the
military academy and a large audience
that nobody who does not put America
first can be tolerated. He added,
however, that the Americans should
set a good example.
The president declared the present
war did not come by accident but that
it had to come. The United States
wants nothing from Europe, he said,
and there is nothing she wants which
she must get by war. He sounded a
warning that no man can tell what the
next day will bring forth in the world's
events. The word "Americanism"
was used today by the president for
the first time in recent addresxen vim.
"constantly referred to the West Point
graduates to wnom he was speaking
but referred more to national and in
ternational problems He warned the
graduates against militarism. The
president's speech was frequently in
terrupted by applause and he was
cheered as he concluded.

On account of the wet condition of
the grounds, the last game of the

tomorrow being an off day. the Omaha

instead, both will strive for base hits,
and the Savages will make a desper
