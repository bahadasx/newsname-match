One Concerns Itself With
Nomination of .Vice Pres

•SUFFRAGE PROBLEM
ALSO IS IMPORTANT
Secretary of War Baker puts
Quietus on Boom For
His Selection.
St. Louis, June 13—The
stage is set for the opening
at noon tomorrow of the
democratic national conven
tion. Two questions are up
permost in the minds of po
litical leaders and delegates.
One was whether Vice Presi
dent Marshall would be nom
inated by acclamation or
whether favorite sons would
insist upon their names go
ing before the convention
for a ballot. The other .was
the probable action of the
a a $
demand! of the
fp^.an 4«»€^uit^ocuf ^eddra-
today sentiment for
the renomination of Mar
shall appeared strong, lead
ers said, adding that there
was talk among them of
starting a movement to have
him named without going
through the formality of
taking a ballot.
The talk of naming Secre
tary of War Baker for sec
ond place on the ticket died
out almost as suddenly as it
started. Baker had much to
do with putting a quietus to
his boom, when he declared
he was for Marshall and that
mention of his name merely
was a "friendly enterprise."
The suffrage plank ques
tion came in for considerable
discussion today.

testimony came as a surprise to the

on her to testify that the cheerful

no hint of a troubled mind- After
four months' thinking, the witness
recalled little things which indicated
to her that Miss Lambert was not
without troubles. She admitted to

grand jury, she had Jumped at con

JEtLICOE PRAISES
BRITISH NAVYMEN
London. June IS.—In a message to
the men of the British fleet, which
was given out here. offlcittfly last
night. Admiral Jellicoe. expressed high
appreciation of the manner in which
the ships of the fleet had fought dur
ing the Jutland sea fight on May SI.
"At this stage, when full informa
tion is unavailable," said the admiral,
"It is Impossible to enter into details,
but quite sufficient Is known for me
to state definitely that the glorious
traditions handed down to us by gen
erations of gallant seamen were most
worthily upheld.
"Weather conditions that were
highly unfavorable robbed the fleet
of the complete victory expected by
all ranks. Our losses were heavy. We
miss many gallant comrades. But al
though it is difficult to obtain accurate
information as to the enemy's losses,
I have no doubt we shall find they
certainly were not less than our own.
Sufficient information already has
been received for me to make that
statement with confidence
"I hepe to give the fleet fuller In
formation on this point at an early
date. I do not wish to delay appre
ciation of the work of the fleet and
my confidence in a future complete
victory.
"The wonderful spirit and fortitude
of the wounded Alls me with the
greatest admiration. am more
proud than ever of the honor of com
manding the fleet manned by such
officers and men."
