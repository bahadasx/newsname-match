JUDGE GARY COMHESDS
JTEIWBERRY COUNTY OFFICERS
Judge Gary Monday morning, in
opening court, reminded the grand
jury of their obligation administered
to them at a previous session of the
on/) ovnlainoH if fllllv tr* them. I
WUi'i auu b<ipiuiuvu a v.
The judge said that one of the most
important duties of a grand jury, as
he thought was in keeping a strict
lookout on the books of the county officers.
He said that Newberry county
is looking to the grand jury to sea
that the county officers discharga
j their duties in a proper way.
i After charging the grand jury as
i to their general duties as to public j
I schools, public roads and so on the
judge said that the laws seemed to
be well enforced in this county, as
there was very little criminal busir.ess
at this term of the court, which j
speaks well of this county.
He also commended the officers in
this respect. In ending the judge indictated
that it would be 110 time lost
at this term of the court and urged the
grand jury to work with all convenient
speed, but told them to take all
time 'necessary for any investigation.
The first episode of "Who's Guilty?"

counsel -was unable to be present on
account of "his official duties in the
Lexington county court which is now
in session. Judge Gary said tfiat as
a rule he was* opposed to granting
continuances but under the circumstances
concerning defendant's counsel
and the further fact that he was
related to the -wife of the deceased,
D. 'A. Lagford, he would grant the petition
and continue the case until the

wretched a condition- There might
be some excuse for the present condition
of this street if it had lately got

MOTORCYCLK AM) BICYCLE
Scene, Folk's Hill Near I'omaria?
Injured, (ieo. Amick and Richard
Hipp.
"Folks liill just beyond Pomaria
was the scene late last Friday afternoon
of a very serious accident when
fhere was a collision between a biI
cycle rider and a motorcycle rider.
The rider of the bicycle was Richard j
Hipp, Jr., son of Mr. Richard H.
Hipp, a prominent merchant of Fo-!
n.iiria. Young Hipp is about 15 years
of age. The rider of the motorcycle
was Mr. George Amick who does a
blacksmith business at Pomaria.
Young Hipp was coming down the
hill at some speed and on the left
nana side of the road and Mr. Amick
j was making high speed on the same
I side of the road with his motorcycle
1 111 ovHor >vPPT?tiatp t.hp ihill
Folks hill is a long, winding, and in
sr.mt- places, a ivery steep hill and
high speed is absolutely necessary if
one is riding a single geared motor!
cvcle. Mr. Amick says that young
Hipp seemed to lose control of his
bicycle and began to dodge about
>crfi?re'- the road se he approached. Mr.
Amick net knowing w!hieir side of the
roa:l young Hipp was going to take,
began to cut his wheel about in an
effort to miss the oncoming bicycle.
Mr. Amick says the next thing he
know, he was lying in the drug store
receiving medical attention.
It seems that !Mr. Amick's chaldron
witnessed the accident and ran for
help. Mr. Adam L. Aull was the first
to reach the injured parties. . Mr.
Amick's injuries while painful are j
noi: serious and he is able to be out. |
Yonng Hipp's injuries wore far more f
serious his arm being broken at the
wrist and one side of his head being j
crushed in. He was hurried to the
hospital in Columbia Friday night..
News reported Sunday at noon was
that he was resting very well. Dr.
Pinner was in Newberry when the ac-;
cideni occurred and a telephone message
reached him at Farrow's barber
shop. He len lmmeuiaieiy m ai&
and reached the injured men in 40
minutes after the message reached
him.

NEW MACHINERY AT THE
NEWBERRY COCA-COLA PLANT,
* I
The 'Newberry Bottling plant for
the 'Coca-Cola products has recently
' u Z~>
installed a new macnine wuicu insures
sanitary bottling of the product
of the plant. The bottles first pass
through a solution of caustic soda and
then they are re-washed and brushed
in pure water. Then the bottles are
rinsed four times inside and out and
conveyed to the bottler. The main
point of this story is that the new
machine which has been installed insures
a clean and sanitary bottle before
thp Coca-Cola is >put in it, and
when you drink tx>ttled Coca-Cola
with the name of the (Newberry (bottling
plant on it you are sure that
you are drinking a purely sanitary
drink. Capt. Langford says ttiat coca
drinks may come and they may go but
that Coca-Cola will sell on forever,
and especially when the drinking
public 'knows that it is sanitary in its
putting up. That is what the Newberry
plant assures you.

THE GREENWOOD BRAND
In the Greenwood Index of the date
of June 1 appears an advertisement
occupying a column of space, the
words of which follow:
Quality First
You Are Sure of Gettine
The Best Grade of
Cotton Goods
When You Call For
Greenwood-Made Goods.
Greenwood Cotton Wills,
Grendel and Ninety-Six
Cotton Mills.
This advertisement directs the attention
of the readers of The Index
to the fact that cloth manufactured
in firppriiwnnd rrmntv of rrvtton erowa
by Greenwood county farmers is intended
for them to wear, and it is
one of the first evidences that wa
have observed of a disposition on the
part of South Carolina cotton mills
to impress their own neighbors that
they are producing a commodity for
others than the inhabitants of Hankow,
Timbuctoo and Chicago. It tells
a story of mutuality of interest be
tween the manufacturers and the
farmers of Greenwood which involves,
of course, the interest of
bankers, merchants and all other
citizens. The man who wears a
Greenwood county shirt and the woman
who wears a Greenwood county
shirtwaist will have a pride in the
"home" factories that make the cloth
and will not feel that they are foreign
establishments set among them
for the sole abject of getting what
they can out of them.
These mills of Greenwood county
doubtless manufacture more cotton
clotft than all the people of the
county use, but that does not take
from the value of the fact that a
Greenwood man with a Greenwood
shirt on his back is likely to have
a better feeling for the cotton mill
than he would otherwise entertain.
These manufacturers of Greenwood
are doing an excellent thing for
themselves when they advertise their
1 - 1 * 5lt- iT\AAT\1A
parinersnip wim men uw u
By the way, it is common knowledge
that everything with the Greenwood
brand wears well, so on general principles
what the advertisement says of
the quality of the cotton goods may
be safely taken as true.?The State.
We quote the above just to let our
Deople see how a live town like
Greenwood appreciates the value of
newspaper space, and how they show
their appreciation of it by using it.
If any of the Xewberry papers should
happen to get out a special edition
the cotton mills are generally very
nice to give them an ad, but when
J- --L ^ r\ it TiM + k O fAeliriS?
mey uy xl mcj w h rm,* ?, 4w...9
that they are making a contribution
to help the newspaper get out the
edition. x
Wonder what President Wright
would say if one of the newspaper
were to approach him in regard to
carrying a regular ad" of the goods
he manufactures. And yet it would
be a good thing for him and the other
mill officials to do, and thus help to
encourage the use of home manufac
tured goods.
But best of all, this advertisement
in the Greenwood Index to which the
State refers, shows that the people of
Greenwood have the spirit of sticking
to their own enterprises and believe
in the spirit of cooperation. That is
what makes a towg grow. Newberrj
is a good town. We have as good
people as the world can provide. Wa
need just a little bit of the spirit of
progress and that spirit which actuates
us to work together for tha
general welfare.
Just this little advertisement of
the cotton mills in the Greenwood
pamper hats given the town an advertisement
in the editorial columns o?
the State and has given it a reproduction
in The HeraW and News. Ani
frequently the public spirit of the
town of Greenwood is pointed to n
in pvamnle "hr the oapers published
ii other towns and thus the town ">r
greenwood is advertised and ad-er;i?ed
in a ' ji verso!e !!2fhf ?nd 5t hplp?
