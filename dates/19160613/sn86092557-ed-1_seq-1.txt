ly denied here today. Mr. Hearne has
taken no steps to be represented by

WILSON BOXES THE
Talks to Cadets About All
The Live Issues of the
Day.
(By Associated Press)
President Wilson making his first
address since the presidential cam
paign began today before the Wesl.
Point cadets discussed preparedness,
militarism. Americanism, the. causes
lot the war in Europe, peace, the Mon
roe doctrine, divided allegiance and
the ideals of America. . .
He declared It is the present Imper
ative duty of the Unitod States to be
prepared, adding "Mankind is going
to know thta when America speaks
she means what she says."
The President Baid the United States
should not be a blustering nation, a
' nation with "a chip on its shoulder"
but a calm nation, which will with
hold its hand as long as possble and
strike only for victory.
The President's address ran through
almost the entire list of subjects dis
cussed by formor Justice Hughes in
his telegram accepting the Republican
nomination and he declared tbo United
States Is ready to join with other na
tions to see the kind of justice It be
lieves in b given.
Shaking his finger emphatically the
.President told the graduates of the
military academy and a large audience
that nobody who des not put America
first can be tolerated. He added how
ever that true Americans should set
, a good example.
The President declared the present
war did not come by accident but that
It had to come. The United States
wants nothing of Europe, he said, and
ther is nothing she wants she must
get by war. He sounded a warning
1 that no man can tell what the next
day may bring forth in the world's
events. \
This country is keep
ing its head.
We are at peace.
Business is going ahead.
Now is your time to
watch for real estate

COMPLETE PDIMARY
RETURN!! AT LAST
Majority of Judge Ira E.
Robinson Now Figured
at 772.
a WHEELING, June 18.?Complete
returns have now been received from
last Tuesday's primary election in
West Virginia for all the prlcipal nom
inations. As the canvass proceeds,
however, slight changes are being
made In the totals, and in a number oi
counties recounts are to be made on
the governorship and the United
States senatorsbip, which ^11 make
the final outcome in the former at
least a matter of uncertainty for sev
eral days.
An error In the tabulating of the
Cabell county vote here gave a gatfn
for Lilly, but this was offset by a sim
ilar gain for Robinson in Logan and
another in Doddridge. As a result of
these changes and the substitution or
the canvassed returns from several
counties, the majority of Judge Ira E.
Robinson for the gorevrnorship was do
creased to 772. This figure, it is
thought, will not be changed materi
ally unless the recounts disclose tho
Irregularities that are being charged.

WATSON DEAL IS
IDE FOR HOUSE
IN ANQIHER PLAGE
New Fairmont Hotel Will Be
Built on the Original
Site.
LOCAL ion THE DEAL
Watson to Be Run as a Good
Medium Priced
House.
The completion of the trade by local
financiers today for the property
known as the Watson Hotel was au
thoritatively announced and the rumor
that this site would be used for the
erection of the new Fairmont Hotel
was denied by the directors of the
company.
According to the most believable of
the misinformation supplied concern
ing the trade for the Watson Hotel, it
has been taken over by a group of
local financiers who have been inter
ested in another West Virginia Ho
tel.
It is said that they will renovate
the Watson and run it as a medium
priced house which will not compete
with the new Fairmont Hoter, which
according to the executive committee
of the company Will be built with
diligence.
