Time in Beginning
His Campaign
St Louis, 'June 12. —Henry Allen,
Kansas progressive leader, here as a
newspaper correspondent reporting
the d&nocratic convention, who has
announced his support of Mr. Hughes,
today expressed belief that Col. Roose
velt also will take an active part in the
Hughes campaign. Mr. Allen said that
Former Representative Victor Mur
dock, chairman of the progressive na
tlonal committee, was most promin
ently suggested to succeed Col. RooBe
velt as the progressives' standard bear
er if Col.- Roosevelt finally refused the
nomination.
"I think the hour is too important for
any man to worry about the name of
the party he is going to support," said
Mr. Allen. "If Col. Roosevelt accepts
the splendid statement of Mr. Hughes
as meeting the conditions which he laid
down to the progressive convention, a
majority of the progressives in the
central and northern states will sup
port Miv Hughes.
^v "As far as I am personally conc«m
ed, If Col. Roosevelt declines the pro
gressive nomination, I will. support
Mn Hughes rather than vote for some
lesser leader of the progressive party
not that I have lost in any way my en
thusiasm for the principles which we
have sought to Introduce but because
I think the fl&ht is going to tie cleanly
between Wilson and Hughes and .in
that case I prefer Hughes."
Although declining to predict posi
tively that Col/Roosevelt will support
Justice Hughes, Mr. Allen said:
"As I read the Hughes statement, it
seems to me to meet the conditions
laid down by Col. Roosevelt and I be
lieve Col. Roosevelt will maintain rath
er an Important relationshlp) to the
Hughes propaganda."
Mr. Allen said Gov. Johnson of Cali
fornia was going to Oyster Bay to.urge
Col. Roosevelt's acceptance of the pro
gressive nomination and that the pro
gressive leaders were considering the
selection of Justice Hughes to fill the
Roosevelt vacancy as the progressive
presidential nominee, with Col. John
M. Parker of Louisiana as the vice
presidential candidate, In order to
maintain the party's existence and its
rights to a place on state ballots,
especially in the south.

PHANGE OF MIND AT LAST MlN
UTE CAU8ES VOTES TO BE
CAST FOR HUGHES.
[BY R. D. MACMANUS.]
The Iowa delegation was among the
last to climb into the Hughes' band
wagon at the republican national con
vention at Chicago. It did not do so
nn Ml the rush had started and until it
appeared certain that the jurist was
to be named on the first ballot
aturdjiy. And yet, it was not be
cause the Iowans were opposed to
Hughes'or not anxious to help nom
inate him.
"On the first two ballots the Cummins
delegates from Iowa were adamant.
As far as the convention could see,
they were 'or the favorite son from
first to last. There was no hesitation
at saying "twenty-six votes for Cum
ifiins" when the roll call reached the
state of Iowa.
A Forelorn Hope.
But every Iowa delegate knew Fri
day night that the Cummins cause was
a forlorn one and that there was not
more than one ohance in a hundred
that the favorite son could be nomin
ated. There were oaucuses and con
ferences after the balloting Friday
night that lasted until 4 o'clock of the
following morning. The "allies"—that
is the delegates pledged to the favor
ite sons—sought in vain to get an
agreement whereby the strength of the
combination could be centered on one
candidate. But each of the favorite
sons waited to be the one man and
there seemed no way to settle the mat.
ter.
Changed Mind at Last Minute.
The conferences ended without
agreement at 4 o'clock Saturday morn
ing and shortly afterwards, the with
drawal of Sherman of Illinois in favor
of Hughes became known. The Iowa
delegates met and the opinion was
unanimous, or nearly so, that the Iowa
delegation, too, should swing to the
jurist. That was the understanding
when the delegates left for the conven
tion hall. Shortly before the gavel
fell, somebody roee up amongst the
Iowans and expressed the belief, that
out of courtesy to Senator Cummins,
the delegation should cast one more
ballot for him. An argument followed
and the delegation divided on the mat
ter. "Just one more ballot,*' was the
plea of some and It was a hard one to
combat. For half an hour, the dele
gates didn't know whether they were
going to stick by Cummins for another
Ballot or whether they yefre going to
Hughes.
Then began* the roll call of states
and as state after state swung into
line for Hughes/it beoame apparent to
the Iowans that they would have to
vote for him at onoe, or forego that
privilege^ entirely. When Iowa was
called, Col. French of Davenport, as1
chairman, arose and in a very few
words, withdrew the name of Cummins
from before the convention and an
nounced twenty-six votes for Justice
Hughes. That practically settled the
nomination for'the other favorite sons
followed suit and the nomination of
the justice came near being unani
mous. As delegation after delegation
swung into line—joined the band wag
on, as tbey say at conventions—the
cheering grew in volume and when the
little delegations from Hawaii and the
Philippines announced their votes for
Hughes the successful nominee was
given a noteworthy ovation.

ACTION BY PARTY
St Louis, June 12.—SufTraglsts of
the newly organized woman's party
and the National American Woman
Suffrage association today rained de
mands for two widely different actions
on their issue upon democratic lead
ers.
The national organization, headed
by Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, insist
ed upon a declaration for suffrage in
the democratic platform, while the
woman's party representative, through
its chairman, Miss Ann Martin, de
clared that unless the convention re
solutions committee demands immedi
ate adoption of the Susan B. Anthony
resolution ny congress her organiza
tion will declare war.
"There is no use to delay," Miss
Martin declared today. "The party
has the votes in congress to pass this
amendment if it so desires. We will
present our last move and the leaders
can do as they choose. The time for
declarations of good Intentions and
friendliness is past. With 4,000,000
voters in twelve states clamoring fqr
universal suffrage, we demand action."
MARTIN FUNERAL TOMORROW.

Fighting Is in.Progress in
Western Fields Where
Big Guns Are Busy
Petrograd, June IS. —Russian troops
yesterday approached the outskirts of
'Czernowltz, the capital of Bukowln^,
the war office announced today.
The statement also says that Rus
sian troops attacked the bridgehead at
Zalesczyky.
As the Russian troops drew near
Oznerowitz, the report says, there were
numerous explosions caused by the
Austrians within the city.
Czernowltz,_the objective of the Rus
sian drive on this part of the front,
was in possession of the Russians for
some time early in the war but they
were compelled to evacuate the city
during the progress of the Austro
German offensive.
Zalesczyky is on the river Dniester,
thirty miles northwest of Csernowitz.
It was in this region that some of the
heaviest fighting of the Russian offen
sive last spring occurred.
WAR SUMMARY.
The German attack on Verdun has
again swung to the east of the Meuse,
following the assaults of Saturday
night on the French positions near
Hill 304, west of the river. Last night
German Infantry charged French posi
tions west of Ft. Vaux but, the French
war office reports, was unable to gain
ground.
At the same time the French posi
tions. near Forts Bouvllle and Tavan
ness, south of Ft. Vaux, were bom
barded heavily. Paris looks for a
severe struggle for possession of Ft.
Souvllle, to which the bombardment
may be preliminary. Should the Ger
mans capture the fort they would open
a breadh in the French defenses which
might jgompel the French to abandon
this entire line and fall back on the
Inner defenses on the right bank of
the river.
We«t of the Meuse the only devel
opment of the night was a heavy ar
tillery action in the vicinity of Chat
tancourt.'
Russians Still Gaining.
The spectacular Russian advahce in
Gallcia and Volhynla apparently has
not been checked, although few de
tails of the campaign are permitted to
come to light. Vienna* concedes the
withdrawal of Austrian troops in
northeastern Bukowlna, where the ad
vance of the Russians has brought
them within thirteen miles of the cap
ital, Czernowltz.
The sinking of two more neutral
merchantmen is reported. The Swed
ish steamship Emmy has been destroy
ed by a mine off Falsterbo, with the
loss of five men. The Norwegian
steamer Bur also has been sunk,
whether by mine or torpedo is un
known. Fifteen men from the Bur
have been landed at Ymuiden, Hol
land.
The Italians claim to have repulsed
the Austrians with heavy losses at
Monte 'Lemerle. The Italian cabinet
has resigned as a result of the refusal
of the chamber of deputies to give a
vote of confidence In the government
after it had failed to pass the budget
pf the ministry of the Interior.
British troops in German East
Africa have captured two towns.
An official British tabulation of Ger
man losses up to the end of May
gives aggregate casualties of 2,924,
586, of which 784,412 represents men
killed. These losses are exclusive of
those sustained in naval engagements
and the fighting in the colonies.
TURKS WIN BATTLE.
Constantinople, June 12.—In an en
gagement on the Irak front, the fight

Stone brought with him from Wash
ington certain drafts of rndtfe impor
tant planks that have been sketched In
some detail by President Wilson and
his advisers in congress and in the
cabinet.
The principal planks-that await pre
sentation to the platform committee
are foreign relations, the Mexican sit
uation, preparedness and tariff. The
'foreign relations plank will set forth
the unprecedented conditions that
h«re arisen as a result of the war and
it will be pointed out that while Pres
ident Wilson has kept us from strife
he has also maintained a neutrality
both "strict and honest."
.A
Mexican Plank'.
The plank on the Mexican situation
will develop that this question has
been approached with the idea of keep
ing peace not only with the Mexican
republic but to maintain peace within
her own borders.
On the question of preparedness the
platform will assert that the party has
met the demands pf the world wide sit
uation by an advanced stage of pre
paredness' of the navy and the enlarge
ment of the army and the reorganiza
tion of the national guard.
The tariff plank ^111 point out that
the reduction of tariff duties so that
the Income from th'at source In normal
times would meet the needs of the gov
ernment is an achieve&ent of the dem
ocratic party.

Waukegan, 111., June It. —One im
portant point as viewed by the de
fense as brought out today in the brief
cross examination of E. O. Orpet, fath
er of Will H. Orpet, being tried for the
murder of Marion Lambert, concerned
disposal of the stock of cyanide of
postassium which the elder Orpet as
gardener of a big estate, kept in the
greenhouse.
Mr. Orpet, questioned by Ralph F.
Potter of the defense, stated that a
month before the death of Marlon he
had Instructed an assistant to throw*
the cyanide away as it had spoiled.
The assistant neglected to do so.
This' statement comprised the one
point of the cross examination.
Direct examination was concluded
by State's Attorney Dady. Mr. Orpet,

Washington, D. C., June 12. —In
creasing excitement and antl-American
feeling throughout northern Mexioo
are described in today's dispatches to
the' state department. In many cases,
it was said at the department, the Car
ranza authorities appear to be Indiffer
ent to what Is going on.
Neither details of the reports, nor In
formation as to the points heard from
were made publib, on the ground that
the work of American consuls would
be handicapped.
Officials made no attempt to conceal
their anxiety over the situation which
apparently is crystallising in the north
ern Mexioan states. Many dispatches
bearing on the subject have been re
ceived during the last forty-eight
hours. Al} .were read immediately on

more important were sent to the white

Equally disquieting reports are

STORY OF AMERICAN COWBOY.
Laredo, Texas, June 12.—George
Con over, an American cowboy cap*
tured by Mexican bandits yesterday
when he and Arthur Meyers trailed
those marauders who raided the T.
A. Coleman ranch at San Samuel, ar
rived in Laredo last night after a
thirty mile trip on foot after his es
cape from the Meklcans.
He said the band which sought to
rustle eighty head of horses across the
border was composed of five Mexicans
and two Japanese. The Japanese, he
said, were later captured by the de
facto government troops. He and
Meyers attempted to follow the Mexi
cans making away with the hones
and cause the animals to stampede,
but they were captured. Conover said
he was treated well by the Mexicans
but the two Japanese wanted to hang
htai
The bandits left hfm and Meyers at
a secluded plaoe and told the Ameri
cans to await their return. The
Americans then took quick flight hid*
ing in the brush when the Mexicans
came back to look for them. The
searchers passed within fifteen yards
of the refugees.
A number of armed citizens and
state rangers' were dispatched to
Webb, Tex., north of here, early to
day on a report that railroad bridges
were being burned. The report was
found groundless but the rangers took
in custody two Mexicans supposed to
have been connected with the band
participating in the Coleman ranch
raid.
'RUMOR NOT TRUE.
Mercedes, Tex., June 12.—Reports
that thirty horsemen had crossed the
Rio Grande south of Donna are re
ported to be untrue by Capt. Haines
and Lieut. Glass of Troop C, third cav
alry, who made an investigation last
night and returned here early today.
They found no ,trace of bandits.
Reports that American soldiers en
gaged with Mexicans across the river'
at Progreso on Friday are also re
ported to be erroneous. The report
is'said to be founded on the fact that
Carranaa soldiers were chasing ban
dits on the Mexican side of the river.
"THROW OUT AMERICANS."
Chihuahua' City, June 11. (Via Mex

nothing to his information regarding
