AMERICANISM NOTE
Tells West Point Graduates
World Must Know U. S.
Means What She Says.
HOLDS IT IS IMPERATIVE
COUNTRY BE PREPARED
Scores Hyphenates and Warns
Against Militarism?Declares
Present War Had to Come.
WEST POINT, N. Y.. June 13.?President
Wilson, making his first address
since the presidential campaign began,
today discussed preparedness, militarism.
Americanism, the causes of the
war in Europe, peace, the Monroe doctrine.
divided allegiance and the ideals
of America. He declared it is the present
imperative duty of the United
States to be prepared, adding, "Mankind
is going to know that when
America speaks she means what she
says." He came here to attend the
graduation exercises at the Military
Academy.
The President said the United States
should not be a blustering nation, a
nation with "a chip on its shoulder,"
but a calm nation which will withhold
its hand as long as possible and strike
only for victory.
The President's address ran through almost
the entire list of subjects discussed
hv fnrmpr .fustics Huehps In his fplptrram
accepting the republican nomination, and
he declared that the United States is
ready to join with other nations to see
that the kind of justice it believes in is
given.
Must Put America First.
Shaking his finger emphatically, the
President told the graduates of the Mil- !
Itary Academy and a large audience that
nobody who does not put America first
can be tolerated. He added, however,
that true Americans should set a good
example.
The President declared the present
war did not come by accident, but that
it had to come. The United States wants
nothing from Europe, he said, and there
is nothing she wants that she must get
by war. He sounded a warning that no
man can tell what the next day will
bring forth in the world's events.
The word "Americanism" was used
today by the President for the first
time in recent addresses. He constantly
referred to the West Point graduates,
to whom he was speaking, but referred
more to national and international
problems. He warned the graduates
against militarism. The President's
speech was frequently interrupted by
applause and he was cheered as he finished.
Text of President's Speech.
The text of the President's speech is
as follows:
"I look upon this body of men who
are graduating today with a peculiar
interest. I feel like congratulating
them that they are living in a day not
only so interesting because fraught
with change, but also because so responsible.
Days of responsibility are
the only days that count in time, because.they
are the only days that give
test of quality. They are the only days |
when manhood and purpose is tried out
as if by Are.
"I need not tell you young gentlemen
that you are not like an ordinary graduating
class of one of our universities.
The men in those classes look forward
to the life which they are to lead after
graduation with a great many questions
in their mind. Most of them do
not know exactly what their lives are
going to develop into. Some of them
do not know what occupations they are
going to follow. All of them are conjecturing
what will be the line of duty
and advancement and the ultimate goal
of success for them.
"There is no conjecture for you. You
have enlisted in something that does
not stop when you leave the academy,
for you then only begin to realize it,
which then only begins to be filled with
the full richness of its meaning, and
you can look forward with absolute
certainty to the sort of thing that*
you will be obliged to do.
Different Prospect Faced.
"This has always been true of graduating
classes at West Point, but the certainty
that some of the older classes used
to look forward to was a very dull certainty.
"Some of the old days in the army, I
fancy, were not very interesting days.
Sometimes men like the present chief of
staff, for example, could fill their lives
with the Interest of really knowing and
understanding the Indians of the western
Vienna, Mivmiig vr not woo fitdUg Oil IIIOIUC |
of their minds and being able to be the
intermediary between them and those j
who dealt with them by speaking their
sign language, could enrich their lives, I
but the ordinary life of an ordinary officer
at a western post could not have been
very exciting, and 1 think with admiration
of those dull years through which of- j
fleers who had not a great deal to do insisted
nevertheless upon being efficient
and worth while, and keeping their men
fit, at any rate, for tne duty to which ;
they were assigned.
"But in your case there are many
extraordinary possibilities, because,
gentlemen, no man can certainly tell
you what the immediate future is going
to be either in the history of this
country or 1n the history of the world.
It is not by accident that the present
great war came in Europe. Every element
was there and the contest had to
come sooner or later, and it is not going
to be by accident that the results
are worked out, but by purpose?by the
purpose of the men who are strong
enough to have guiding minds and indomitable
wills when the time for de
ci5ion ana bc in cm cm comes.
U. S. Has Fart to Flay.
"And the pert that the United States
is to play has this distinction In it. that
it is to be in any event a disinterested
part. There is nothing that the United
States wants that It lias to get by
?ar, hut there are a great many things
that the United States has to do. It
has to see that its life is not interfered
wltn by anybody else who wants
something. %
'These are the days when we are making
preparation, when the thing most
commonly discussed around every sort
of table. In every sort of circle. In the
shops and in the streets, is Preparedness.
and undoubtedly, gentlemen, that
is the present imperative duty of America?to
be prepared. But we ought to
know what we are preparing. I remember
hearing a wise man say once
that the old maxim that 'everything
|comes to the man who waits Is all very
well provided he knows what he is

statement of June 12 says.
The Austrians captured 1,300
Russians.
Drove Back Bussian Force.
The statement follows:
"In northeastern Bukowina AustroHungarian
troops disengaged themselves
from the enemy under heavy
| rear-guard fighting. German and AusI
tro-Hungarian regiments by a counter
attack drove back a hostile force ad'
vancing northwest from Buczacz. ThirI
teen hundred Russians were captured.
I "On the height east of Wisniowezk a
! Russian attack was delivered this
| morning, but it broke down under our
artillery fire. East of Kozlov, AustroHungarian
scout detachments captured
a Russian advanced post. Violent
fighting continues northwest of Tarnopol.
The positions near Vorobievka
(northwest of Tarnopol), which have
been mentioned repeatedly, changed
hands several times.
"Along the Ikwa and in Volhynia it
was comparatively quiet. Yesterday
west of Kolki we repulsed a Russian
attempt to cross the river. In that
o. ?vArvwhere. the losses of
the Russians corresponded to their
reckless use of masses of troops."
Berlin Official Report.
Regarding fighting on the eastern
I front, the statement issued today by
the war office says:
"Eastern front: On the Dvina, southleast
of Dubena (seventeen miles southeast
of Jacobstadt), the fire of our batteries
disposed of a Russian cavalry
brigade. Northwest of Baranovichi the
artillery fire of the enemy was more
j lively.
"The army of Gen. von Bothmer repulsed
completely an attack made by the
| enemy on the Stripa, west of Przewloka.
Near Podhaijze a Russian aeroplane was '
overpowered by a German aviator in 1
an aerial battle. The pilot and the ob- j
server, the latter a French officer, were .
captured. The aeroplane was saved."
^ Czernowitz Reported Taken. 1
PETROGRAD, June 12, via London, <
June 13.?A rumor is in circulation here
| that the Russians have occupied Czernowitz,
capital of the Austrian crown *
I land of Bukowina.
The rumor lacks official confirmation, '
I but it has been given color by the cap- '
ture of Dobronovtze, a commanding s
noint ten miles to the northeast. The !
I Russian line extends to Okna. From
both these points good roads lead direct ^
to Czernowitz, and. according to miliI
tary authorities, they are the only '
| points in this direction capable of de- '
fense.
A telegram received from Bucharest.
Rumania, says the Austrian army had
evacuated Czernowitz and moved to a
line four miles to the west.
The continued successes of the Russians
recorded in today's official communication
are the more surprising, as
the Austrians, after the first shock of
the Russian advance, appeared to have
rallied their forces and offered extremely
stubborn resistance. This is indij
cated by the fact that they were able
to mass sufficient forces in the vicinity
of Kolki. north of Lutsk, to cause the
Russians to retire across the Styr river.
Check Only Momentary.
I Mot nnlv here, but at other Doints on
tHe Volhynlan front, furious counter
! attacks characterised the last forty j
i hours of fighting. but without being
' able to check, except momentarily, the
! force of the Russian advance.
It is not believed here that the Germans
are sending many troops to aid
the Austrian?;. It is pointed out that
only in one instance?during Russia's
spectacular Carpathian campaign?did
Germany send any large number of
men to the relief of the Austrians. Instead,
it has always been their practice
to undertake an offensive on some other
line in an endeavor to draw off the
Russians. It is the opinion of observers |
here that it is not improbable the Germans
are more likely to attempt an offensive
on the northern section of the
Russian front than to risk weakening
their lines by detaching any number of
men for the purpose of stiffening the
Austrian defense.
The number of Austrians captured by
the Russians in the new offensive movetncnl
has been increased to more than
114,000. In many sectors of the front,
an official statement says, the Russians
still are pursuing defeated Austrians.
Owing to storms in south Russia and
consequent temporary rupture of telegraphic
communication, reports are delayed
and news from the armies is restricted.
Nevertheless, it is confirmed
that Gen. Brusslloflf's offensive continued
yesterday.

there is another angle to their proposition.

providing that no justice of the Supreme
Court shall be available for

Six Senators Approve Plan.
Six democratic United States senators,
in a conferpnpe last night, approved
this idea. They said steps
would be taken to force a vote of the
resolution in the House and put the
republicans on record before Congress
adjourns. They also said they had
reason to count upon the support of
four or Ave republican senators in behalf
of the resolution.
Others among the leaders in the party
failed to enthuse very much over the
availability of this as a prime campaign
issue, as advanced by the proponents
and throughout the country, in
view or Mr. Justice nugnes sustained
observance of the ethics prior to his
nomination would not think it worth
while to worry about.
There is a feeling: of depression todaj
among the rank and file over the announcement
of so many leading progressives
of their adherence to Mr
Hughes. That George W. Perkins
George von L. Meyer. Senator Cummins
Henry Allen and others should come
out for Mr. Hughes is very discouraging.
They fear it will spoil their plana
to invite wholesale recruiting to the
democratic ticket from the ranks of the
bull moosers.
Undercurrent of Apprehension.
There is no question that underneath
their* outward air of satisfaction ovei
the action of the republicans at'Chicago,
there is a feeling of bitter disappointment
that Col. Roosevelt did
not bolt, and now there is growing apprehension
over the return to the republican

The democratic leaders today are I

of allowing the campaign to start off
with intense personal bitterness is being
pointed out today by those who
fear that reprisals in kmd by the republicans
would be certain. al
Hughes' Political Acumen Worries, ai
ci
The proposed plank referring to the
Supreme Court and elective office continued
to be the principal topic of in- ^
terest during the forenoon, with vary- . |
ing opinions expressed by the demo- J
eratic henchmen as they milled around
the lobbies and state headquarters. n>
There is no doubt that they feel very P)
bruised over Mr. Justice Hughes dropping
his judicial reserve and donning P
the high hat. J
Up to the last they had hoped that; 8
the man they regarded as the most
formidable opponent of their party's |
leader would remain in the cloistered ! ,
seclusion 'of the Supreme Court. The j '
New York democrats know to their sor- t.
row that Mr. Hughes is a politician to ;
be feared, and they have respect for j
his ability in that line.
The advisability of adopting a plank j
agreeing with the subject of a dead
line between the bench and the -hust- is
ings is a much-mooted question. Sena- .
tor Hardwlck of Georgia and Roger Sul- n
livan of Illinois are opposed to attack- "1
ing it in the convention. o<
Says Intrigue Must Be Proved. 1,1
"If the gentlemen who propose such ?
a plank are prepared to prove that a,
while a member of the Supreme Court d<
Mr. Hughes intrigued to get the re- P
publican nomination for President 111
there might be some merit in the prop- c<
osition." said Senator Hardwick. "I do ai
not believe such proof exists, and* if it
cannot be gotten I think such a plank a]
would hurt rather than help the democratic
party. The people are not likely
to forget that we took Alton B.
Parker from the highest court in New
York state in 1904. I do not see any d)
difference in principle between a na- '
tional and state court in this respect." h'
"Such a plank would be foolhardy," h>
said Roger Sullivan of Illinois, promi- w
nently nominated by his friends for
vice I'resiueni. outri ? iimim wuuiu
l>e construed as an attempt to play
politics with the highest court in the st
land."
Representative Rainey, wha will be
the Illinois member on the resolution n'
committee. sai<l while he believed in e:
the principle that a Supreme Court
member should not go into politics, he ,
doubted the policy of making platform .
planks out of such an issue. tj
On the other hand, Senator Willard
Saulsbury of Delaware said he favored ^
such a plank and did not believe it
would violate the proprieties any more
. than thejilatform declarations in 1S96
with reference to the courts.

"They are closest to us in sympathy, d
