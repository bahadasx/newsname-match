DISPUTE OVER
EXPENSES FOR
TRIP JO COAST
Express Company Demurs
On Paying for Man to Go
After Edwin Shields
Though former Manager Edwin
Bhields of the Lyric theatre is under
arrest in San Francisco, charged with
embezzling $478 from the Adams Ex
press Co. in this city, there is a prob
ability that some time may elapse'be
fore a policeman from this city is sent
. to the Golden Gate to return wit
him as it is stated that the officials
of the express company and the po
lice department are divided In opinion
as to who should foot the bills in
curred by the cross-country trip.
It "is said that the police have "not
enough money at hand to pay the ex
penses of the trip and it is not be-
lieved that the express company will
advance the ' money' necessary to
finance the trip. The attitude of the
corporation is said to be taken be
cause, when Capt. Charles H. Suckley
was sent to Delano, Cal., for Thomas
Blair Semlar, who embezzled J400
from the company, the express com
pany advanced the money and th
state repaid only part of it.
Shields left this city on August 1,
1913 with $478 that he had obtained
from actors to whom he had issued
money order blanks while acting as
agent of the express company. He was
arrested in San Francisco on June 2
when Detective Peter Hall heard that
he was in that city and had the au
thorities there take him into custody.
When the appropriations were ask
ed by the various city departments,
the police board desired money that
would enable it to meet such a con
tingency but only $200 was appro
priated, which is known as the presi
dent's fund. As the expenses of this
trip would amount to nearly $600, that
. would not suffice.
The company is said to be unwilling
to stand the expense of the trip al
though Agent Samuel Driver stated
.today that the higher officials had
not taken any official action. Mr.
Driver said that he understood the
state was to send an officer to return
with Shields and that it would be
:up to the state as Shields had com-
Imitted a crime and was to be held
i responsible.
Superintendent John H. Redgate,
-when asked if anyone was to be
sent by the department said that he
"believed someone would be and that
" Detective Sergeant George Fox would
: be the man to go. The superinten-
i dent said that he could not state defin
itely whether the state or the express
company would hsie to furnish the
funds. i.

Church Obtains Bight to Sell
Through Appeal to Su
preme Court.
The last wishes of Dr. Nathaniel S.
Wordin, for many years a physician
and druggist in this city and a direct
descendant of founders of the original
Congregational church at Stratfield,
that his property on Toilsome hill,
once the site of the famous school,
should be held in trust-'for Congrega
tionalists in this country until it had
attained a value of one million dollars,
have been thwarted.
The will having been broken by ap
plication to the Supreme Court ef the
State of Connecticut, the historic prop
erty by deed of sale filed yesterday in
the Fairfield town -clerk's office has
passed into other hands and may soon
become the site of another handsome
country club, or become a part of the
handsome residential section that has
recently sprung up into being in the
Stratfield section.
v Rich in the associations of historic
legend the property is located upon
the eminence of Toilsome hill, com
manding a beautiful view of the Sound
from Milford to Southport and over
looking the industry of Bridgeport. It
is central between old Stratfield and
what is now Stratfield road, contain
ing 52 acres bounded by Toilsome Hill
road, Greenfield Hill road, Stratfield
road, and Valley Road. It was the
site of the original . Toilsome hill
schoolhouse built in the 1600's and
even now existing on the opposite side
of Stratfield road behind the house
occupied by W. A. Wilkes on the
Brbnson Hawley farm. . The home
stead Still remaining in a modernized
condition, two stories in height and
for many years occupied by the late
C. W. Peet, is said to have been the
original residence of Deacon David
Sherman, who founded the Congrega
tional church at Stratfield that is now
continued by the United Congrega
tional church of this city.
The property, because , of its as
sociation with the Congregational
church of this section, t was cherished
by the late Dr. Wordin as something
that should perpetuate the fame of
David Sherman and the old church.
In nisi will filed at the time of his
death, during the SVs, it was stipulat
ed that, with life use to the heirs, the
property should be left In trust with
the 'Congregational Home Mission so
ciety to accumulate until its value
had reached the million dollar mark.
It was recently decided, by the so
ciety into whose possession it had fal
len that its value in centuries to come
would not meet with the expectations
of its original owner and donor. Ap
plication for permission to sell the
tract was made to the supreme court
of Connecticut and granted.
The deeds -filed in Fairfield yester
day show that it was conveyed by the
Mission society to attorney "John H.
Casey, et al." Though the considera
tion is given merely as "$1 and other

ONE THROWS HIMSELF
ON MERCY OF BOARD
Entire Profession May Suf
fer, Is Intimation of
C. S. Canfield:
The ethics of the legal profession
in Bridgeport have been rudely trans
gressed with the result that intima
tions are rife today that at least five
well known attorneys have faced or
are about to answer serious charges
before the grievance committee of the
Fairfield Bar association.
While admitting that a number of
complaints have been made and that
hearings are likely within the next
week. Attorney C. Stuart Canfield,
beyond admitting that Attorney
George Kane, whose offices are at
925 Main- street has already appeared
before the committee to plead guilty
to charges of unprofessional' conduct,
refused today to divulge the names of
other lawyers involved.
Attorney Canfield, a prominent
member of the grievance committee
deprecated the alleged practices of
the profession as said to have been
laid bare in complaints registered by
clients. He intimated, that unless a
check was'placed upon the profes
sional ethics seemingly prevalent
here, the entire profession must suf
fer.
It is understood that Attorney Kane,
who appeared before the committee
last Friday in answer to charges pre
ferred against him admitted the acts
and threw himself .wholly upon the
mercy of the members. Definite
action on his case has been deferred
and temporary suspension rather than
disbarment will be recommended, it
is said.
Rumor today places the names of at
least four other lawyers, some of
whom have been prominently indenti
fied in the list of those who will soon
appear before the grievance commit
tee. To divulge their names prior to
investigation of complaints against
them by the committee, would.be ob
viously premature.

St. Louis, June 13 William J. Bry

asserted most emphatically that his
reportorial role will be his first inter

which the party now stands, and au
thor f" numerous peace treaties, now
has a treaty to propose to other Dem

gressives to the support of the Demo
cratic ticket next fall.
"Now is the opportune time for the
Democratic party to get most of the
Progressives," said Mr. Bryan in a
hasty acroas-the-corridor interview as
he reached his hotel today.
"The Progressives' were not at all
satisfied with the results of their con
vention at Chicago," Mr. Bryan con
tinued. "I believe the time is ripe
for the Democrats to secure a large
part of the Progressive vote.

COL. NATHAN H. HEFT OWNED
STREET RAILWAY STOCK WORTH
$520,000, DECLARES WIDOW
The disclosure that the late Col.
N. H. Heft owned street railway stock
having a par value of $520,000, was
one of the features of the hearing iri
the superior court this morning on
Frances Helen Heft's attempt to get
additional alimony from the - estate.
It was claimed by- counsel for Mra
Heft, who was Col. Heft's wife, that
she did not know about these bonds
at the time she agreed to accept $20,-
000 alimony from Col. Heft.
Assistant Secretary J. C. Hempstead
of the New Haven Railroad Go. was
called by counsel for Frances Heft to
testify regarding the stock. He said
Col. Heft in 19 05 owned 1015 shares
of Greenwich Tramway Co. stock and
4,635 shares of New York & Stamford
Railway Co. stock. These were trol
ley lines promoted by Col. Heft.
In 1905 these lines were absorbed
by the New Haven system and CoL
Heft received New Haven bonds in
exchange for his stock. The witness
was unable to state just how many
bonds were given for the stock.
Judge John S. Pullman, represent
ing Mary Josephine M. Heft and oth
er Heft executors, objected to the ad
mission of too much testimony about
the stock. He characterized the
19 05 period of the New Haven's his
tory as a "drunken orgy of shameless
purchase" and said it was well known
Pickpocket Goes To
Jail For Sixty Days
As the evidence did not prove that
Jacob Frost and Samuel Rosen took
the pocketbook from the purse of
Mrs. Eva Hibbard of 390 Benham
avenue as she was standing in a crowd
on Main street on June 5, the charge
of theft from person could not be
prosecuted in the city court today
and the charge of breach of peace
against Rosen was nolled while Frost
was fined $1 and costs and sentenced
to 60 days in Jail.
Frost in court last week admitted
that he was a professional pickpocket
but stated, that he was innocent of
the charge against him. Both he
and Rosen have long records.
Detective Sergeant George Haux re
ceived letters from two former em
ployers of the pair and they stated
that they believed th'Vn honest and
upright and would employ them at
any time. Frost is a painter and Ro
sen & barbar. ,
"They are closest to us in sympathy,
anyway, you know," Mr. Bryan added.
He indicated that the end in view
might be largely accepted by the writ
ing into the .Democratic platform of
Progressive planks. "I have no plans
except to cover this convention," was
Mr. Bryan's cryptic answer when
asked if he would address the. conven
tion or appear before the resolutions
committee in behalf of peace and anti
militarist planks.
, When Mr. Bryan arrived, few of the
Democwiie leaders were out of bed
but he had an impromptu reception in
the hotel lobby. Later Mr. Bryan
made the following statement:
"I have come to the convention as
a newspaper correspondent and do not
expect to take any official part in the
convention. Having been defeated for
delegate in my own state I will not ac
cept a seat on the floor as an alter
nate from Nebraska nor accept a
proxy from any other state."
Mr. Bryan had several callers " dur-

of Herbert Parsons, member of the
Republican national committee from
this state. ' '
' One of the-first developments of the
day at Mr. Hughes" headquarters was
an announcement by Lafayette B.
Gleason, secretary of the Republican
National convention which indicated
that a sub-committee of the National
Committee would in "a few days,"
call upon the nominee to discuss the
matter of the chairmanship of the
Republican National committee.. Sev
eral names ,were under consideration
but one man's guess was as good as
another, Mr. Gleason said, as to who
would be selected.

for governor of New York on a Pro
gressive ticket, sent a telegram- to
Mr. Hughes today pledging his sup

that the road paid far more for cer
tain' trolley lines than they were
worth.
All this testimony regarding the
trolley stock was brough out .to
prove Frances Heft's claim that sine
was deceived regarding the value of
Col. Heft's estate. When she was
granted a divorce in 1902 She agreed to
accept $20,000 alimony. The inventory
as presented to the court at that time
showed the value of the Heft estate as
$100,000.
Mrs. Heft declares certain assets
were concealed ' by Col. Heft and that
he was worth $600,000. Testimony re
garding the value of the Heft residence
on Park avenue was introduced to
day. N. C. Herz was called as a real
estate expert. He said the property
is worth between $65,000 and $75,000
at present. He declared Col. Heft had
told him that the house alone cost be
tween $90,000 and $110,000. When
asked on cross examination if he
could obtain $40,000 for the Heft
property now, the witness said he
wouldn't swear that he could.
Judge Pullman declared Frances
Heft should produce some evidence of
fraud if she has any. Mrs. Heft wants
$150,000 damages from the Heft exe
cutors. The hearing was resumed this
.afternoon before Judge Webb.

America Must Come First

Chief Executive Says In
Address Warning Cadet
Graduates Against Spirit
of Militarism.
Preparedness of Nation Is
With Definite Aim In
View, and Not In Spirit of
Aggression, He Says
Touches On Subjects In,
Hughes' Address.
West Point, N. Y., June 13
President Wilson, before the
graduating class of the U. S. .,
Military Academy, making his1
first address since the presi-:
dential campaign began, today
discussed preparedness, mil-;
tarism, Americanism, the'
causes of the war in Europe,
peace, the Monroe doctrine, di
vided allegiance and the ideals
of America.
He declared it is the present
co-operative duty of the United
States to be prepared, adding
"Mankind is going to know
that when America speaks she
means what she says."
The President said the United
States should not be a bluster
ing nation a nation with "a
chip on its shoulder" but a
calm nation which will with- ,
hold its hand. as long as possi
ble and strike only for victory.
The Presidents addres ran
through almost the entire list
of Former .Justice Hughes in
his telegram accepting the Re
publican nomination, and he
declared that the United States
is ready to join with other na
tions, to see that the kind of
justice it believes in is given.
Shaking his finger emphatically, the
President told the graduates of the
military academy and a large audienca
that nobody who does not put Ameri
ca first can be tolerated and he added,
however, that true Americans should
set a -good example.
The President declared the present
war did not come by accident but that
it had to come. The United State3
asked nothing from Europe, he said, .
and there is nothing she wants which
she must get by war. He sounded a
warning that no man can tell what
the next day will bring forth in the '
world's events.
The word "Americanism" was used
today by the President for the first
time in recent addresses.
He constantly referred to the West
Point graduates to whom he was
speaking but referred more to national
and international problems. He warn
ed the graduates against militarism.
The President's speech was fre
quently interrupted by applause and
he was cheered .as he concluded.
The speech follows:
"I look upon this body of men whoi
are graduating today with a peculiar j
interest. I feel like congratulating ;
them hat they are living in a day j
not only so interesting because fraught '
with change, but also because so re-i
sponsible. Days of responsibility are
the only days that count in time be
cause they are the only days that give
test of quality. They . are the1 only
days when manhood and purpose id
tried out as if by fire.
"I need not tell you intelligent men
that "you are not like an ordinary
graduating class of one of our uni
versities. The men in those classes
look forward to t'he life which they 1
are to lead after graduation with a ,
great many questions in their minds. '
Most of them do not know exactly ;
what their lives are going to develop
into. Some of them do not know
what occupations they are going to
follow. All of them are conjecturing
what will be the line of duty and
advancement and the ultimate goal
of success for , them.
"There is no conjecture for you.
You have enlisted in something that
I does not stop when you leave the
academy for you then only begin to
realize it which then only begins to
be filled with a full richness of its
meaning and you can look forward
with absolute certainty to the sort of
thing that you will be obliged to do.
"This has always been true of
graduating classes at West Point, but
the certainty that some of the older
classes used to look forward to was a
very dull certainty. Some of the old
days in the army, I fancy, are not
very interesting days. The ordinary
life of an ordinary officer at a West
ern post could not have been very ex
citing and I think with admiration of
those dull years through which offi
cers, who had not a great deal to do,
insisted, nevertheless, upon being ef
ficient and keeping their men fit for
the duty to which they were assigned.
"But in your case there are many
extraordinary possibilities, because,
gentlemen, no man can certainly tell
you what the immediate future ia go-j
