No Immediate Intention of Call­

Guard.
CONSIDERABLE UNREST IN
NORTHERN SECTIONS
Secretary Lansing Drafting Re­
ply to That Carranza
Note-
Washington, June 12.—With 1,500
additional regular troops ordered to
the Mexican border tonight, and re­
ports of the "rapid spread of anti
American feeling continuing to pour
in from consuls all over northern
Mexico, administration officials made
110 attempt to disguise their uneasi­
ness. It was admitted officially that
there is a growing alarm over what
the agitation may produce, and the
possibility of an attack on General
Pershing's expedition. Part of the in­
creasing apprehension here is due to
the renewed raids in the Laredo re­
gion. Several reports dealing with
the situation have been received. Offi­
cials have declined to reveal details.
To Fill Gap*
The new force sent to the border,
Secretary Baker said, was to fill in
gaps In the guard. It will be compos­
ed of ten companies of coast artillery
and a battallan of engineers. The
secretary said there was no present
intention of calling out" additional
National Guard regiments for border
duty. General Mann, commanding at
Laredo, reported that a patrol of
three cavialrymen was fired on during
the night of ^une 10, near Hachita,
and Private W. L. Saunders, Troop K,
12th cavalry, was slightly wounded.
Two Mexicans who did the firing, es­
caped.,,
Considerable Unrest.
A message from Captain Buarrage
commanding the 'battleship Nebraska,
at Vera Cruz, said there was consider­
able unrest in that region, due ap­
parently to the currency situation.
The state department, through Spe­
cial Agent Roberts, at Mexico City,
has called attention of the de facto
government to the anti-American out­
breaks, which for nearly two weeks
have been spreading steadily. Many
towns have held mass meetings, and
protested against the continued pres­
ence of American troops in Mexico.
Carranza Men Idle.
Reports of consuls, telling of the
agitation were turned over to the Car­
ranza officials, more as a matter of
Information than as representations.
Instances have been reported -where
the Carranza troops appear to have
stood idly toy while the agitators
stirred up antagonism against the
United States.
Officials have been unable to deter­
mine the inspiration behind the out­
break against anti-American feeling,
or to estimate the ability of General
Carranza to protect American lives or
property.
Secretary Lansing is at work on his
reply to the Carranza note, demand­
ing 'withdrawal of American forces.
Bandit in Carranza Uniform.
One of the three Mexican bandits
killed today in the chase of outlaws
who raided the T. A. Coleman ranch,
near Laredo last night, wore a Car­
ranza uniform, bearing the insignia
of a Carranza lieutenant colonel, ac­
cording to a message received here
tonight. One of the bandits taken
prisoner identified the body at
Weebbs' Texas, this afternoon as that
of Lieutenant Colonel Villareal of the
Carranza army.
Cenobio Mendez, a Mexican cowboy,
who was captured by the bandits in
the raid on the Coleman ranch and
scaped when the Mexicans were sur­
prised when attempting to burn the
bridge on the I. & G. N. railroad, near
Webbs, said tonight the bandits talk­
ed freely of their purpose to burn
the bridge and wreck a train, aftet
which they intended killing and rob
bing the passengers. At Encinal, just
east of Laredo, the bandits, accord­
ing to Mendez, permitted him to write
a farewell letter to his wife, the ban­
dits having previously stated their inV
tention of killing him. The letter was
given to Villareal, leading the band,
who promised to deliver it to Men­
der's wife. This letter was found on
the bandit's body.
Deputy Sheriff Dolores of Laredo
headed the posse which intercepted
the bandits at the bridfie, and it was
the deputy's shot which killed Villa
teal there. Villareal and his hand

T. Roosevelt
at Oyster Bay
Oyster Bay, L. I., June 12.—Col
Roosevelt was visited at Sagamore
Hill today by James R. Garfield and
Wm. Dean Lewis, according to his
secretary, John W. Mc^raf, who re­
turned from Chicago. The colonel
had a "full and frank discussion with
Mr. Garfield and D. Lewis, as "to what
he intends to say with regard to the
'political situation," and "the time he
should say it."
Neither visitors 'twould make any
settlement after the interview.
Ths:iirs-t man to escape "was James
J, King, serving five years for grant
larceny. He was working in a brick
pile when he was discovered missing.
No trace was found of him, but the
officials believe that he is hiding some
where near Bismarck as he did not
have time to get away before the de­
puties 'were in ipursuit.
Mulick, the other prisoner who es­
caped, had a tetter chance and may
have bo-irded a freight or in some
other way made a get away.
He was a trusty and has been herd­
ing the prison cows for some time.
He went out with them as usual yes­
terday morning, but last night the
cows came home without him. It is
not likely, the officials believe, that he
even started the cows home there­
fore he may have left anytime during
the day.
Rewards have been offered for the
recapture of each.
Warden Talcott was out of the city.
The force in pursuit was in charge of
Deputy Warden Reed and was out all
night.

today, calling the republican party "a
remarkable fulmination" with one-ha^f

Senator Stone said that he consid­

as full of menace and danger.
States His Objection.
"My objection to the nomination of
Mr. Hughes," was the senator's state­
ment, "lies in the fact that I regard
it as bad in every way, even vicious
for a great political party, hard press­
ed and on its uppers, to invade the

and tolce down from that bench one
of its justices to make him a party
candidate for a political office to mee?

able that men appointed to the su­

ping stone to what they will, as Mr.

school girl for whose alleged murder
Will H. Orpet is on trial here.

ed simply, directly and •with studied

Miss Davis had been regarded as

that she had been living with friends
in Chicago for the past six weeks and
had not seen Mr. Dady of the prosecu­
tion for the past six weeks.
The testimony given by Miss Davis
today differed in some instances from
that given before the grand jury, but
she asserted that in the time which
has passed since the first examina­
tion, she remembers some things in
greater detail- Miss Davis testified of
seeing Miss Lainbert shortly before
she went to Helm's woods. She said
her friend appeared to have some­
thing on her mind.

noon. Dr. E. R. Lacount testified to

for it was pointed out that J|r.

however, to make it clear that he was

for the office.

know if there had been any change in
plans to rename Marshall.
No Hitch Says MoCombs.

to rename the present Democratic

A move to defeat Vice President

Wm. J. Bryan does not expect to
precipitate any fight on the party plat
farm. That was the Information
brought here tonight by a close Mend
of the former secretary of state, who
admitted that Mr. Bryan might not,
after all, go before the resolutions

make any effort to obtain a pro*y
that would seat him on the convention
floor. Mr. Bryan is expected here
late tonight, or tomorrow, when Sena­

to mean that the Democratic party
