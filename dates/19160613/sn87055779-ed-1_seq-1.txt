yond Demidovna today to threaten
the investment of Lemberg, the for

It is believed here that the Austro

t..day from I'.ucharest state that the
Austrian military authorities have
ordered the civilian population to

plainly that Ilmberg s now the main

important railroad junction om

The drive against Lemberg is un
der the personal command of (ieii.

now apparent, is to be from at least
two sides from the northeast,

from the captured fortress of Dii'mo:

in the h;-nds of the federal trade

at the hearing being held today in
connection with the commission's
investigation into the increase in the
price of gasoline. The eaniKe men
J are determined to make every effort
I to control the retail price of gasoline
within their particular districts ac-
I cording to the evidence. The move
is being instilled on the eround that
'the standard Oil and the indepen

to drie the gärige men out of the
trad' by establishing their own gas

automobilists. The garage men say
they must combine in self-defense.
The federal trade commission has
inaugurated a searching investiga

whether violation of the law exists.
It is stated that the garage men are

DISRUPTS
OF PRQSEC
Bosom Friend of Marian Lam
bert Faüs State as Witness
Against Orpet.
International News Service:
WAFHKC.AN. 111., June 1
While all Lake county gaped and
marveled. Josephine Davis, bosom
friend and confidente of Marian
lambert. continued today to ruth
lessly knock apart the structure of
circumstantial evidence which the
state had so carefully built up
against Will Orpet. Miss Davis was
supposed to have ben the prosecu
tion's star witness. When her direct
testimony was ended Orpet- was
grinning and his lawyers were elat
ed. Not once during the morning
did she blacken the student's case.
The climax of her testimony, how
ever, came suddenly in her cross
examination just at noon. She was
asked whether she remembered a
birthday party.
"Yes," she replied. "Marian was
crying, and she said to me: 'If Will
Orpet gives me up and marries Co
leste Youker I will kill myself.' "
The defense made no attempt to
conceal its joy at this statement. It
was sfpiarely in line with its whole
theory of Marian Iunbert's death.
The prosecution's method of
questioning was along the hammer
and tongs way. Time and again
the attorneys for the state pleaded,
ridiculed and finally in desperation
denounced her for- her replies.
Attorneys Attack (iirl.
At one time, when particularly
incensed. Atty. Joseph Fyn ripped
out:
"Have you recently become an in
timate friend of the defendant?"
"I certainly have not!" the girl
shot back at him.
"Are you his intimate friend
now ?"
"T am not."
"Didn't you shake hand' with him
after leaving the stand here last
night ?"
1 did."
Her the cmut interened and
the prosecution temporarily aban
doned this line of attack.
Josephine couldn't remember, she
declared, many of the little inci
dents on which the state has built
its case.
Where she was expected to testi
fy that Marian was happy and care
free prior to her death, as she teti
f:el at the coroner's inoue.-t. Jose
phine state.! today that Marian was
morose and sad particularly after
the announcement of ( tret's en
gagement to Celeste Youker was
made. At that time. Josephine de
clared. Marian had said:
"I'll fix him!" and thereafter grew
sullen.

In Washington it is believed that
the white house has drastically
changed its views of the Mexican

quested the call for the state militia
of Texas. Arizona and New Mexico
he has r. number of times asked for
mote troops, but all requests were
refused until Sec'y of War F.aker
issued yesterday's orders. The an
nouncement of the sending f addi

at the state department of othcial
messages forecasting the attitude
the Mexican people would take
when they learned that the Ameri

Prepare For FprUing,
The state department already has
evidence that rebel leaders in Mex
ico, and some Carranza officials aie
preparing to rise with greater
strength against the American
forces. Ammunition is now being
gathered in the interior of Mexico
in supplies as Iarce as can be ob
tained. Since the American arms
embargo was clamped down, small
lots of arms and ammunition have
been received at Mexican ports from
foreign countries. One official to
report this was Capt. G. II. Ibirrage
of the I'nited States ship Nebraska
at Vera Cruz. Capt. P.urrage said
the Mexican natives were more in
censed at the Carranza govern nent
because of the confiscation of their
paper money than they were at
Americans because of the continued
stay of Pershing's forces in Mexico.

of world
peace will be set forth in the demo
cratic national platform to be adopt
ed by the convention which meets to
morrow. The peace plank will be
added to the foreign relations de
claration, the draft of which, writ
ten by Pres't Wilson, was made pub
lic yesterday exclusively by the In
ternational News service.
The suggestion that Furo pea n
peace be prayed for in t he . platform
comes directly from Pres't Wilson
and it wiil undoubtedly be acceeded
to by the resolutions committee
which has the linal word in framing
the platform. The president's last
word on the international planks in
the tentative platform now under
consideration will reach St. Louis
tonight when Sec'y of War Newton
I . lJaker arrivts and it w ill cause
the final revision of the declaration
of party principles. While the es
sentials of the platform have been
agreed upon. Pres't Wilson may de
mand changes in the phraseology of
various planks and party leaders
are very willing to accept his dic
tum. No Fight F.Kviol.
The probability of any prolonged
or bitter light on the resolutions
committee or :n tlie convention
over the platfor n became more and
more remote today. Members of
the committee already selected were
making every effort to placate
seemingly obstreperous democrats
who wanted individual planks in
cluded In the platform. The pro
posal to incorporate a plank de
manding that supreme court jus
tices be barred from accepting any
other political ollice met with little
favor among conservative demo
crats, and it was practically settled
that any tight n.ade for this declar
ation would meet with little success.
The arrival of William Jennings
Fryan today was expected to bring
to a focus the threatened trouble
over prohibition, woman suffrage
and Philippine independence. Mem
bers of the resolutions committee
declared that Mr. Fryan. with all
other advocates of special planks,
would be accorded a full and free
hearing. Put it was clear that the
linal word on proposed declarations
would have to come from the white
house.
.May Let Fryan Sjn-ak.
As a means of placating the com
moner, it was s Jg'-'ested today that
arrangements m ght be made to se
cure unanimous consent for him to
address the Convention itself tp pre
sent his views on any subject. Pair
nnd liberal treatment of Fryan. the
leaders believed, would eliminate
any probability of a serious contest
over any special issue.
Democratic leaders were bom
barded today by the suffragists
whose organizations have made
their presence deeply felt. Tlie
suffragists plan to demand that the
democrats induce a suffrage plank
as a means of offsetting the repub
lican declaration on this subject.
They assert that the democrats
should go further than the repub
licans in an effort to secure the .1,
O00.ojo wannen voters in the west,
who. they declare will have a voice
in selecting the next president.

the military academy graduation ex
ercises. He took a slap at Col. Koosevelt
when he said:
"Never since 1 was a youngster
have I been afraid of a noisy man;
1 have always feared a still man."
Touching on the Furopean war he
said it was not by accident that the
war came and it will not be by ac
cident that the end will come.
The president referred again to
his views n the proposed league of
neutral nations. He said:
"We are ready to become partners
with the other nations of the world
i ti seeing that justice is given to all
nations. We are spiritual partners
of both continents of this hemis
phere. We stand ready with our
I PlS i v to protect the liberty and in

"hyphenates" the president said:
"No man who does not put Am
erica, first can consort with us."
Condemns .Militarism
The president in referring to the
cadets as "you youngsters" admon
ished them that they should be "cit
izens before olfn ers" pointing out
that they faced "extraordinary pos
sibilities."
In condemning militarism he said:
"No one loves a nation with a
chip on its shoulder."
The cadets applauded vigorously
when the presid-nt said after he had
talked about preparedness:
"Mankind is growing to know that
when Ameiica speaks she means
what she says."
It is our imperative duty to be
prepared, the president said, wo
ought to know what we ate prepar
ing for, as it would be hazardous if
we did not know. He said a fear of
militarism caused some people to op
pose preparedness.
