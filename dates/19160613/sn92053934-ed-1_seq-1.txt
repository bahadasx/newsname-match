DEMO-MOOSE
PARTY URGED
BYW.J.BRYAN
Former Secretary of State
Declares Time Is Ripe
for Coalition.
PROGRESSIVES SORE
Nebraskan, in Reporter's
Role, Says Leaderless
Group Unsatisfied.
St Louis. Mo.. June 13. William J.
Bryan, newspaper reporter, from Ne
braska, arrived here today to "rover"'
the democratic national convention. He
asserted most emphatically that his
reportonal role will be his first inter
est. But the former secretary of state,
chief builder of many democratic
platforms, incuding the one on -which
the party now stands and author of
numerous peace treaties has a new
treaty to propose to other democratic
leaders a pact between the demo
crats and progressives to induce most
of the Bull Moose to support the dem
ocratic ticket next fall.
Can (iet Progressives.
"Now is the opportune time for the
democratic party to pet most of the
progressives," said Mr. Bryan in a
hasty arross-the-corridor interview as
he reached his hotel early today.
"The progressives were not at all I
satisfied with the result of their con-1
venlion at Chicago." Mr. Bryan con
tinued earnestly. "I believe the time '
is ripe for the demorrats to secure a j
large part of the progressive vote. i
"They are closest to us in sympathy, J
anyway, you know," Mr. Bryan added.!
He' indicated that this might, be largely
accomplished by the writing in the
democratic platform progressive
planks that would appeal to the Buil
Moose.
Will Merely "forer" Session.
''1 have no plans except to report
this convention." was Mr. Bryan's
cryptic answer when asked if he would
address the convention or appear be
fore the resolutions committee in be
half of peace and anti-militarism
planks or take any part in the vice
presidential contests.
When Mr. Bryan arrived few of the
democratic leaders were out of bed
but he held an impromptu reception
in the hotel lobby and with difficulty
made his way through a crowd of
hand shakers to his room. A large
percentage of those who greeted him
Were fellow-correspondents.
Later Mr. Bryan made the following
statement:
"I have come to the convention as
a newspaper correspondent and do
not expect to take any official part in
the convention. Having been defeated
for delegate in my own state, I will
not accept a seat on the floor of the
convention as an alternate from Ne
braska nor accept a proxy from any
other state."
Mr. Bryan had several callers dur
ing the day and talked about the sit
uation. The fact that Mr. Baker had just
left President Wilson when he an
nounced that he favored Mr. Marshall
for renomination also gave support to
the idea of having Mr. Marshall ac
claimed the candidate without calling
the roll. It was said that Governor
John P. Morehead of Nebraska may
withdraw his name as a candidate for
vice president. The Nebraska delega
tion is instructed for him and if he
carries out his plan to withdraw other
candidates in the field may do like
wise, it was said.
Wilson Favors Marshall.
Early today it was reported here
that President Wilson had sent word
fci St Louis that he regarded Indiana
as one of the most important battle
grounds of the coming campaign and
that he would be pleased to see dele
gates art as a unit in renominating

Hughes Puts
Approval on
GermanBody
New York. June 13. Charles E.
Hughes, in response to questions put to
him today by newspaper men In re
gard to his altitude toward the sup
port offered him by the Gorman-Americans,
said it was "one of undiluted
Americanism."
"I stated my position very clearly,"
said the republican presidential can
didate in my telegram to the conven
tion. "My attitude Is one of undiluted
Americanism and anyone that sup
ports me is supporting an out and out
American and an out and out Ameri
can policy, absolutely nothing else."
Mr. Hughes dictated his statement
on "undiluted Americanism" in re
sponse to repeated requests of inter
viewers and in the face of his prev
iously announced determination to say
nothing further on the issues of the
day until his formal notification of
nomination. He met the correspond
ent by appointment and after discuss
ing his plans informally for a few
minutes, dictated the statement, stand
ing in a group of about forty news
paper men and other callers.
It was the only statement he made
during his talk with newspaper men
that he would permit to go out as au
thorized by him.
Mr. Hughes expects to remain here
until Monday when he will go to Provi
dence, R. I., to attend commencement
exercises of Brown university from
which he was graduated.
National republican headquarters
will be established in New York with
a second office in Chicago, in the opin
ion of Herbert Parsons, member of the ,
republican national committee from
this state.
One of the first developments of the
day at Mr. Hughes' headquarters was
an announcement bv Lafavette B.
Gleason, secretary of the republican!
national convention, and also of the!
New York state republican committee
which indicated that it will be several
days yet before any decision is report
ed on the question of the man who is
to succeed Charles D. Hilles as chair
man of the republican national commit
tee. Mr. Gleason said that a sub-committee
of the national committee would
in a few days call upon the nominee to
di:-.ruM. tho matter.
Another development was announce
ment from the candidate's headquar
ters that moving pictures would be
employed to aid his campaign. It is
planned to throw on the screen
throughout the country pictures of Mr.
Hughes, "in order that the people may
again become familiar with Charles E.
Hughes because he has for so long a
time been virtually out of public life."
The screens will also display impor
tant passages from Mr. Hughes' tele
gram to the national convention ac
cepting the nomination.

N. M., June 13. The finishing blow
was given the largest surviving band
of Villa followers in Chihuahua at day
light June 9, by 20 men of the Thir

Captain Otto W. Retherst in a dashing
canyon fight 20 miles north of Santa

unhurt.
The Americans routed 23 Villa ban

and capturing all their horses and
saddles, some rifles and several thou
sand rounds of ammunition, crippling
the band completely.
A night ride brought the Americans
into the canyon at daybreak, where
they followed fresh horse tracks. Rid

camped in a grove of pines. It was a
complete surprise. There was a head

"SWARMING"
Add toForce
on Mexican
Border Line
Washington, June 13. Fifteen hun
dred additional troops were being mob
ilized today for Mexican service in view
of continued reports of anti-American
demonstrations in Mexico and bandit
raid3 on Texas territory.
Ten companies of coast artillery,
drawn from fortifications between
Portland, Maine and Sandy Hook, and
a battalion of engineers from the bar
racks in Washington, were under or
ders to join General Pershing's army
and assist in guarding against further
border raids in the region near Laredo.
Assistant Secretary of War Ingram,
in the absence of Secretary Baker,
faced a situation which officials admit
ted appeared serious. They feared not
only continuance of bandit raids but
the effect which the killing of three of
the bandits, who raided the Coleman
ranch near Laredo Sunday, might have
on the Mexican people. Equally puz
zling to officials was the question of
what purpose is the basis for the anti
American demonstrations and the re
newed border attacks.
Reports persisted that certain Car
ranza officers have agreed not to inter
fere with the Mexican general, De La
Rosa in his threatened attack oh bor
der communities. In this connection
was cited the report that one of the
bandits killed after the Sunday raid
had been identified as Lieutenant Col
onel Villareal, aCarranza officer. Even
civil authorities of northern Mexican
states are said to be relaxing their
strict allegiance to the Carranza gov
ernment and issuing orders independ
ent of the Mexico City officials.

oi railroad managers and officials of

about 350,000 employes, looked peril
ously near a-d4toclrloday. This w;as
the result of the application of what
the men called a "yard stick" to their
demands. In this the railway officials

This proposal was regarded so un
favorably by officials of the unions that

DAVIS GIRL HELPS
ORPET'S DEFENSE
Chum of Little Marion Lambert Con
tinncs Testimony On Stand
Detrimental to State.
Waukegan, 111., June 13. Josephine
Davis testified today that Marion Lam
bert, for the alleged murder of whom
Will H. Orpet is on trial here, threat
ened to commit suicide if it proved
that Orpet had transferred his affec
tions to another.
The school girl witness, called by
the state, continued to testify for the
defense. She completely repudiated
previous stories of the cheerfulness of
Marion, her chum, and told of fits of
depression over fear that she was in
a delicate condition and later when
this fear became less acute after Jan.
20, over the reported defection of Or
pet. It was Dorothy Mason who told
Marion that Orpet, a student at the
University of Wisconsin, was engaged
to marry Celestia Youker, according
to the witness.
" 'I wonder why she told me that,'
Marion said to me," related Miss Davis.
" 'Maybe it was just to make me feel
bad.'
"So we framed up a letter to Orpet
but as no reply was received Marion
began to think that Miss Mason had
told the truth. It was on Feb. ti when
Marion had her 18th birthday party
that she threatened to kill herself. She
was cheerful, very, very cheerful dur
ing the party but when she was alone
with me, she cried.
" 'It is seeing all those girls in there
so happy that makes me think of
what's on my own mind,' she told me.
'Honest if Billie has thrown me over
I'll kill myself.'
"I laughed at her just 'to try to get
her out of that mood and then she
laughed too. I said you won't let me
tell everything to your mother now;
snau j leu wnai i Know alter your
death? She laughed and said: 'Well, I
guess not. There will be gossip any
way aim we migni as wen give them
something to gossip about.' "

AMERICA NOT
AFTER FIGHT
HE DECLARES
President Reveals Principles
of Party in Speech at
West Point.
SLAMS UNPATRIOTIC
Those of Divided Allegiance
Not to Be Tolerated
His Warning.
TVest Point, X. T June l.V
President Wilson, making his first
address since the presidential
campaign began, today discussed
preparedness, militarism. Ameri
canism, the causes of the war in
Lurope, peace, the Monroe doc
trine, divided allegiance and the
ideals of America. He declared it
is the present imperitive duty of
the United States to be prepared,
adding, "mankind is going to know
that when America speaks she
means what she says."
The president said the United States
today ehould not be a blustering na
tion, a nation with "a chip on its shoul
ders," but a calm nation which will
withhold its hand as long as possible
and strike only for victory.
The president's address ran through
the almost entire list of subjects dis
cussed by former Justice Hughes in
his telegram accepting the republican
nomination, and he declared that the
United States is ready to join with other
nations to see that the kind of Justice
it believes in is given.
Shaking his finger emphatically the
president told the graduates of the
military academy and a large audience
that nobody who does not put America
first can be tolerated. He added, how
ever, that true Americans should set a
good example.
War Not an Accident.
The president declared the present .
war did not come by accident, but that
it had to come. The United States
wants nothing from Europe, he said,
and there is nothing she wants which
she must get by war. He sounded a
warning that no man can tell what the
next day will bring forth in the world's
events.
The word "Americanism" was used
today by the president for the first
time in recent addresses. He con
stantly referred to the West Point
graduates, to whom he was speaking,
but referred more to national and in
ternational problems. He warned the
graduates against militarism.
The president's speech was frequent
ly interrupted by applause, and he was
cheered as he concluded.
Days of Responsibility.
In his speech the president said:
"I look upon this body of men who
are graduating today with a peculiar
interest I feel like congratulating
them that they are living in a day not
only so interesting because fraught
with change, but also because so re
sponsible. Days of responsibility are
the only days that count in time, be
cause they are the only days that give
test of quality. They are the only days
when manhood and purpose is tried
out as if by fire.
"I need not tell you young gentle
men that you are not like an ordinary
graduating class of one of our univers
ities. The men in those classes look
forward to the life which they are to
lead after graduating with a great
many questions in their mind. There
is po conjecture for you. You have
enlisted in something that does nat
stop when you leave the academy, for
you then only begin to realize it and
you can look forward with absolute,
certainty to the sort of thing that you
will be obliged to do.
"This has always been true of grad
uating classes at West Point but the
certainty that some of the older
classes used to look forward to was a
very dull certainty. Some of the old
days in the army if any were not very
interesting cays.
Many Possibilities.
"But in your case there are many
extraordinary possibilities, because
gentlemen, no man can certainly tell
you what the immediate future is go
ing to be either in the history of this
country or in the history of the world.
It is not by accident that the present
great war came in Europe. Every ele
ment was there and the contest had to
come sooner or later and it is not go
ing to be by accident that the records
axe worked out but by purpose by the
purpose of the men who are strong
enough to have guiding minds and in
dominitable wills when the time for
decision and settlement comes.
I'. S. Must Play Its Part.
"And the part that the United States
is to play has this distinction in it,
that it is to be in any event a disinter
ested part. There is nothing that the
United States wants that it has to get
by war but there are a great many
things that the United States has to
do. It has to see that its life is not
Interfered with by anybody else who
wants something.
"America fortunately, does know
what she wants to do with her force.
