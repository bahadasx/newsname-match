ST. LOUIS, Ha, June 18.—WU
11am Jennings Bryan arrived ttoday—
and found the democratic national
convention ready to tell him "good
bye and God bless you."
Nothing couJd be more indicative
of how democracy's times have
changed than the fact that the greet
oomxaoner, four times a dominant
figure in national conventions and
three times democracy's candidate
for presidential honors, now figures
in the councils of that party as a
mere alternate from Nebraska and a
reporter.
In all the platform talk heard to
day there was no indication that
the Dormer secretary of state would
have a hand in the helwing of the
planks. He pledged himself several
weeks ago not to Inject the prohibl-
today willing to let Bryan alone,
with hopes that Bryan would also
let democracy alone and raise no
discordant note in the harmony pro
gram.
Twenty years ago the silver tonguad
orator oame to the 1896 convention
democrat' as a reporter, thrilled
democracy with his eloquence and
departed Its presidential candidate.
Four years later he was renominated.
In 1904 his leadership was rejected
and another candidate chosen, but
four years later it was Wm. J. Bry
an who made the race as democracy's
standard bearer. In 1912 it was
Bryan who forced the nomination erf
Woodnc»w
Wilson Bryan who headed
off Champ Clark and Bryan who
dictated the platform.
In the convention of 1916 Wm. J.
Bryan will 'be a reporter again—Just
as he waa twenty years ago.
•He is officially accredited also as
an alternate. Alternates oannot ad
dress the chair from the floor except
by unanimous doosent. Newspaper
reporters, of course, cannot partid
pate in the proceedings. Therefore,
I according to all indications today,
Wta. J. Bryan will be out of the shew.
I He may be Invited to make a speech
when the business of the convention
has proceeded to the point where
oratory is needed to fill in—but no
aid nor advioe will be sought of him
tio port in the drama of democratic
politics will be cast for him.
