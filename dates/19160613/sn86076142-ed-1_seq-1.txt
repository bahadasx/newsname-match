Respect This Nation
By Aseociated Press.)
WEST POINT, N. Y., June 13. President Wilson in making his
first ttdilri'HH since the campaign began discussed, preparedness, mili
tarism, Americanism, cause of the war in Kurope, peace, the Monroe
doctrine, divided allegiance anil the ideals of America, lie declared
it was the present imperative duty of the United States to he prepared
lidding, "by making the German know that when an American speaks
he means what he says."
Shaking a finger emphatically he said nobody who docs not put
America first can not be tolerated.
General Goethals is here and 'its is expected he will confer with
Wilson regarding his desire to retire. . 1
(By Aaaoclattd Press.) j
ST. LOUIS, June 1:1. Delegates gathering here have- turned
from a diseussioin of the ticket, which they feel hourly is more cer
tain of being Wilson and Marshall, toward the consideration of a
chairman of the national committee to manage the campaign. Three
names are considered: William R Salisbury, Delaware; Ildnier II.
Cummings, of Connecticut, and Colonel K. M. House.
While it is likely to include the form of a suffrage plank the
convention will probably give the issue no stronger endorsement than
what was vouchsafed by the Republicans, a leader declared. The
women's party is preparing to fight.
I Br AaaarlatMl Prraa.)
NKW YORK, June 13. The new committee meets Saturday
when it will select a chairman. Cunimings is almost certain if the
chairman comes from the committee. Prospects of a fight over
the vice-presidential nomination have diminished and delegate are
lining up for Marshall. The Sullivan boom is not taken seriously
even by himself. There is some talk
to obtain the nomination of a western man.
