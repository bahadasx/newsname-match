WILSON HOLDS TIGHT
REIN OVER GATHERING
OF DEMOCRATIC HOSTS
Mound City Convention a One-Man Show
Rehearsed in Capital and Personally
Directed from White House.
By E. A. FOWLER.
qSum News Service.p
St. Louis. Mo., June 12.-The Democrats assembling here for their na
tional convention are worried. The thing is too one-sided, too much of a one
man show.
They are afraid it won't be worth the price of admission, and incidentally
it won't look as good in the newspapers as did the recent double-headed per
formance in Chicago.
The Democrats are hoping somebody will start something, make a little
trouble that won't be serious, but that will give the seasoning to this dish that
is being prepared by zhe party cooks.
