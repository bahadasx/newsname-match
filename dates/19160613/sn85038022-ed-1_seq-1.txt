with the tldo of talk.
A move to defeat Vice-President

defined form nnd substance when Hen
"ry Morgcnthau, who recently gavo up

nounced that a "stronger man" than
Marshall should bo named and brought

that It might Indicate that tho naming
of Mr. Baker would not bo unaccepta

hastened, however, to mnko It clear
that ho was urging Mr. Bakor'a nom

.Schlff Suggest Stronger Man
National Chairman William V. Mc

that a stronger candldato bo named
and Mr. Morgcnthau statod that he
had a letter from Mr. Schlff also re
questing that another thnn Mr. Mar

Talk that Secretary Baker's namo
would bo presented as a candldato for
Vice-President caused a ruBh of dolo

other party leadors to know If there
had been any chanpp In tho plana to

ROAD COMMISIONERS
Ask That Election Set For Juno 24 He
Set Aside and Explains Their
Hcnson For Same.
Tho undorslencd, recently appoint
ed by tho Mnson FIscnl Court no mom
borB of a Commission to supervise tho
oxpendlturo of tho proceeds of any
bond Issuo that might bo voted In Ma
son county for tho purposo of building
roadB, dcslro to mako tho following
statement to tho voters and tax payers
of Mason county, Kontucky:
Immediately upon tholr appointment
they proceeded to circulate petitions
asking that an election bo hold on Sat
urday, Juno 14th, 101G, to ascertain
Whether or not tho voters of Mason
County nro In favor of voting bonds
In tho sum of J200.000.00 for the pur-
nnnn nf bulldlnc nubile roads and
bridges. Aftor theso petitions had been
lodaed with tho Mason County Judgo,
and tho election called It doveloped
that thoro was somo question whether
or not the election hold In November,
1914, was valid, and a bond Issue of
$200,000.00 already authorized by tho
voters of Mason County. After se
curing legal advice on this point thoy
find that If tho question of tho validity
of this election la carried through tho
courts that In all probability tho dec
tlon would bo held valid, and the Fis
cal Court would bo required Jo Issuo
1200,000.00 In bonds.
Tho members of this commission
feel that a bond Issue exceeding S200,
000.00 Is not authorized at the prcs
cnt time, and Is not desired by tho
voters of Mason County, nnd thoy arc
therefore unwilling under tho clrcum
stances to advise tho voting of an ad
dltlonal 1200.000.00 bond Issue until
It Is definitely determined whether the
formor election was validly hold, ana
they nro unwilling to sorve on said
Commission If 1400,000.00 In bonds aro
authorized especially slnco thoy feel
that tho oxpendlturo of that amount of
money would bo unsatisfactory to the
tax payers of Mason county at this
time. Furthermore, by reason of the
uncertainty surrounding tho validity
of tho November, 1914, election tho
voters would bo unable to voto Intelli
gently at the proposed election. Under
these circumstances thoy feel that in
Justice to themselves nnd In order to
promoto the best Interests of the tax
payers In Mason County that it wouiu
be unwise to hold tho proposed eiea
tlon on June 24th, 1916, nnd therefore
thoy hnvo asked that tho petitions
heretofore filed by thorn requesting
tho calling of said election be with
drawn and that tho order of the
County Court calling the olectlon bo
set aside.
