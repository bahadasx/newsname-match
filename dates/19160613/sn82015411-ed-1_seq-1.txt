MEETING OF LIHUE
A novel and most delightful af
fair was the dinnei for members
of the Lihue Uuior Church at the
home of Mr. and Mrs. Lydgate on
Tuesday evening last. A long
table was extemporized for the oc
casion, and 24 members sat down
to a delicious dinner, finding their
places by a sort of place card of
duplicate flowers.
There was a freshness and novel
ty about the whole affair, as well
as a spirit of cordial fellowship
which gave it vivacity and enthu
siasm from the start. One of the
interesting features of the dinner
was an impromptu poll ot the
guests as to the coming Presiden
tial election, with an overwhelm
ing vote for Roosevelt, though one
or two voted, two hands at a time,
for Hughes. Wilson didn't seem
to be in it.
Another interesting teature of
the dinner was a toast to Mr. Pur
vis, in which Mr. Lydgate faceti
ously referred to bye-gone events
when Mr. Purvis had so far for
gotten his dignity as to imperson
ate John Knox in a vaudeville
show; and feelingly expressed his
deep sense of appreciation for the
loyal and unfailing support which
Mr. Purvis had given to the church
during all these years of his con
nection with it
Adjouruii g from the table and
passing into the other rconi, th.
more serious business of the even
ing was introduced by a short ex
planation by Mr. Lydgate of the
purpose of the gathering m which
he recalled in a word, the history
of the church, now 20 years old,
and suggested that the time had
come for it to move forward to
new lines of usefulness and activ
ity. The first matter to be taken up
was that of treasurer. Mr. William
Henry Rice introducted a reso
lution of appreciation to Mr Pur
vis for his long years of faithful
service as treasurer. Mr. W. N.
Stewart was then elected to the
vacant position.
After some consideration il was
decided to have a finance commit
tee, with a view to interesting
evtiy member in the finances of
the church. Such a committee
was elected to have general charge
of the finances of the church and
cooperate with the Treasurer.
A church clerk, and two deacons
were elected, who shall perform
the duties generally incumbent on
such officers; also two deaconesses,
who are to represent the church in
ministrations to the sick A capa
ble decorating committee will see
that the church is appropriately
decorated as mav be required;
while a printing committee will
see to the publication of a regular

STAGED
OPENING
DOOR
Lorenzo Dondos, a Eilipino em-
Vloy ee of the Hawaiian Sugar Co.,
was murdered under somewhat
peculiar circumstances last Satur
day night.
The man had retired for the
night, and was awakened by a
knock on his door. He arose to
answer the summons and upon
opening the door a hand holding
a dagger was thrust in, driving
the sharp instrument deep into
his abdomen, and quickly with
drawn, the murderer darting away
into the gloom before those arous
ed by the wounded man's cties
could catch a glimpse of him. Al
though given every possible aid,
Dondos died in the hospital about
an hour later.
Inquest on the body is withheld
until this afternoon, in order to
give the police, a chance to work
on the slight clues which are in
their possession. A demented Fili-
pinois held under suspicion, though
as yet no conclusive proofs are
available.
