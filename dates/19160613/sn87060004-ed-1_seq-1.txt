HUGHES FOR
AND AMERICA FIRST
G. 0. P. Nominee For
Strong Foreign Stand
Is For Prepar
edness Washington, D. C. June 10.
' Following is the message Justice
'Hughes sent to Chairman Darding
accepting the Republican nomination
for president:
"Mr. Chairman and Delegates; I
have not desired the nomination. I
have wishej to remain on the bench.
But in this critical period of our na
tional history I recognize that it is
your right to summon and that it is
mu paramount duty to respond.
"'You speak at a time of national
exigency transcending merely partisan
considerations. You voice the de
mand for a dominant, thoroughgoing
Americanism, with firm protective
upbuilding politics essential to our
peace and secunty; and to that call,
in this cricis, I cannot fail to answer
with' the pledge of all that isjn me to
the service of our country. There
fore, I accept the nomination.
For Eight of Americans
V4,I stand for the firm and unflinch
ing maintenance of all the rights of
American citizens on land and sea
I neither impugnmotives nor under
estimate difficulties. But it is most
regrettably true that in our foreign
relations we have suffered incalculably
from the weak and vacillating course
which has been taken with regard to
Mexico, a course lamentably wrong
with regard to both our rights and
our duties.
"We interfered without consist
ency, and while seeking to dictate
when we were not concerned, we uf
terly failed to appreciate and discharge
our plain duty to our own citizens.
"At the outset of the administra
tion the high responsibilities of our
diplomatic intercourse with foreign
nations were subordinated to a con
ception of partisan requirements - and
.presented to the world a humiliating
spectacle of ineptitude.
U. 8. Has Lost Prestige
"Belated efforts have not availed
to recover the influence and prestige
so unfortunately sacrificed, and brave
words have been stripped of their
force by indecision.
"I desire to see our diplomacy re
stored to its best standards, and to
have these advance; to have no sac
rifices of national interests to parti
san expediency; to have the first
ability of the country always at its
command, here and abroad, in dip
lomatic intercourse; to maintain firm
ly our rights under international law,
insisting steadfastly upon 'all our
rights as neutrals, and, fully perform
ing our international obligations,; and
by the clear correctness and justice of
our position and our manifest ability
and disposition to sustain them to
dignify our place among the nations
i Have Only One Country
"I stand for an Americanism that
knows no ulterior purpose; for a pa
triotism which is single and complete.
"Whether native or neutralized, tf
whatever race or creed, we have but
one country, and we do not for an
instant tolerate any division of Al
legiance. '"I believe in making prompt pro
vision to assure absolutely our na
lional security. 1 believe in prepar
edness, not only entirely adequate for
our defense with respect to numbers
and equipment, in both, army and
navy, bu$ with all' thoroughness to
the end that m each branch of the
service (here may be the utmost efll.
ciency under the most competent
"PREPARE"
administrative heads.
"We are devoted to the ideals of
honorable peace. We wish to pro
mote all wise and practical measures
for the just settlement of internation
al disputes.
No Danger of Militarism
"In view of our abiding ideals,
there is no danger ofTVnilitarism in
this country. We have no politics
of aggression, no lust for territory,
no zeal for strife.
"It Is in this spirit that we demand
adequate provision for national de
fense, and we condemn the inexcus
able neglect that has been shown in
this matter of first national import
ance. We must have the strength
which self-respect demands, the
strength of an efficient nation ready
for every emergency,
"Our preparation must be indus
trial and economical as well. Our
severest test will come after the war
is over. -We must make a fair and
wiser adjustment of the tariff in ac
cordance with sound principals to se
cure our economic independence and
maintain American standards of
living.
"We must conserve the best inter
ests of labor, realizing that in de
mocracy patriotism and strength must
be rooted in even handed justice
JwHoneit Business
"In preventing, as we must, unjust
discrimination and monopolistic prac
tices, we must still be zealous to as
sure the foundations of honest busi
ness. "Particularly should we seek the
expansion of foreigh trade. We must
not throttle enterprise, here or abroad,
but rather promote it and take pride
in honorable achievement.
"We must take up the serious
problem of transportation, of inter
state and foreign commerce, in a sen
sible and candid manner, and provide
an enduring basis for prosperity by
the intelligent use of the constitution
al power of Congress, so as adequate
ly to protect the public on the one
hand and on the other to conserve
the essential instrumentalities of
progress.
"I stand for the principles of our
civil service laws. In every depart
ment of government the-highest effi
ciency must be insisted upon. All
laws and programs are vain without i
efficient and impartial administration.
Indorses 0. 0. P. Platform
"1 cannot, within he limits of this
statement, speak upon all the sub
jects that will require attention. I
can only say that I fully indorse the
platform you have adopted.
"I deeply appreciate the responsi
bility you impose. 1 should have
been glad to have that responsibility
placed upon another. But I shall
undertake to meet it, grateful for the
confidence you express.
k'I sincerely trust all former diN
ferences may be forgotten and that
we may have united effort in a pat
riotic realization of our national need
and opportunity.
Ml have resigned my judicial office,
and I am ready to devote myself un
reservedly to the campaign"
'Charles E. Hughes."

HUGHES AND

Strongest Ticket Possibfe
Named on the Third
Ballot.
JUSTICE HUGHES RESIGNS
PRflM 5IIDPCUC nniirj-r-
Hum VUI IIMML uuuut:
Chicago, Jane 11. Hughes and
Fairbanks.
This was the ticket named in
the Republican national conven
tion in the Coliseum yesterday
by practically a unanimous vote:
of the delegates.
Justice Hughes was nominated)
for president on the first ballot
of tho convention, and former 1
Vice-President Chnrlan Warrant
ly thereafter was named for
candidate for vice president.
The Progressive convention-'
which' had failed to reach an.
agreement on a fusion nominee
with the Republicans, nominated
Col. Roosevelt for president, and
then took a' recess before naming
the candidate for vice president.
While the Republican conven
tion was adjourning sine die word
reached the Coliseum that Jus
tice Hughes had resigned from
the Supreme court and was send
ing a statement of his positioa
on the issnos of the hour.
The promptness with which the.
justice signified his intention of
accepting the nomination and
with which he came forward with
a statement of his views was gen
erally regarded as a move on thai
part of Mr. Hughes to head off,
if possible, the naming of a third
ticket by the Progressives and
insure the reunion of the factions
in opposition to the reelection oC
President Wilson.
