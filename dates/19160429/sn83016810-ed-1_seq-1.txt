Because of his familiarity with the Charter, the present
methods of administration of all branches of the city gov-
ernment, it will not be necessary for him to devote six or
eight months of the two years' term of office to familiar-
ize himself with the complex problems that confront the
chief accounting officer of the City of St. Paul in con-
trolling its finances. He will be in a position to effect an
efficient organization immediately upon assuming office.
