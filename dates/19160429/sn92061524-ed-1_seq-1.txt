The Roy Theatre put on a show
Saturday evening that was not
on the bills and was a surprise
alike to the Management and
' Audience,':. v.-;' ' .. -' -
Just when the Arc was; turned
on to commence the sHw the
belt on the engine broke and the
flying end struck the gasoline
, tank knocking a hole in it In
the attempt to make hasty tem-j
' porary repairs the gasoline was
emptiedlin a bucket and a torch
secured to try .'to solder the tank.
The blaze from the torch igni
ted the gas that had leaked on
the floor and in an instant the
whale engine room was in flames.
Bob ' Grunig and Mr, - Peare .

severely burned in removing the
bucket of gasoline. - ,The employ
ees of Goodman's store ran for
their Chemical Batteries and . put
out the blaze before it did any
harm but ftv gallons of gasoline
burning icJle' a building, that
v would all burn except-the nails,
was a .serious risk. ' -; :
. There was a large crowd in the
Theatre when the ' fire started
. and the lurid glare through the
. window on the semi-darkness
left no room for doubt as !to the
situation. We give this audience
credit for being 'the headiest
crowd we ever gaw under simil
ar circumstances. - AH arose and
walked, quitely out at the entran
ce with less crowding than they
would have at the end of the
show. No one inside said a word
or attemoted any outcry and
there were no casualties.
, The engine house has been re
moved to a safe distance from
- the theatre, building and has
been safeguarded so there is
little chance for a repetition of
; ; the danger. ' : ": ;;v l",:
The Management have doné
everything reasonable to make it
up to their patrons for the occur
ranee of Saturday night by giv
ing a free show Tuesday even-
..Mng.' v"-',::. ; ':::yj.!;'r':!
The building was insured but
the contents representing an in-,
vestment of more than $2000.00
was un-insured. .
The presence of the Goo4man
Fire-fighters is all that saved the
building and no one can guess
how much more of the ' town
might have gone with it" Pre
paredness" .would suggest'. that
more of 'theW :; effective little
Chemical tanks should be where
. they can be had on short notice
. in emergencies like this.
The dance given by the Har
ried Ladies of Roy át ths? vHall
Monday evening was a signal sue
cess in every respect. Socially
it is reported as one of the best
ever given in Roy and financially
ii aaaea a very; acceptable sum
to the exchequer of the band.
All who attended pronounce it
a most pleasant affair and com
mend the ladies for the entcrt
prise they displayed in manag
ing it" ' '
The receipts were $38.Sa and
the ; expenses were only $10.20
so the net receipts will be óüite
a boost for the band.
