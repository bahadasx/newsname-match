MUSIC RECITAL
At St. John Hall Friday Night lly
rnpiis 01 St. I'atricK
School.
"Wizards of tho bow and masters
of the keyboard" during two hours
held tho attention of a spellbound au
dlcnco Friday night when the nlano
violin and volco pupils of tho music
department of tho St. Patrick schools
nppeared In a recital at the St. John
Hall. Hapt attention was given each
rendition, the appreciation of which
was shown by the heartiness of ap
plauso which followed. "Crown of
Triumph," the title of tho opening
number, could aptly have been applied
to each succeeding number, for each
was rendorod In a manner which was
a real triumph to both teachers and
pupils.
Brilliant was tho playing of the
Misses Eppenstclncr and Wlllett
whilst the dance of the sunshine ran
through the "Happy Waltz," as glee
fully executed by tho llttlo tots. Helen
Dinger and Mary Jano Hartlns. The
duo, "Dixie Land," by the Drown bro
thers, had to it a distinctive touch of
the seml-trops, so understanding!'
these young lads played It. A beautiful
effect was given to tho violin duct by
tho woll-nlght faultless playing of
Francis Comer nnd Myles Hrown. The
Seller number, presenting Irish folk
songs, was played by John Francis
O'Donnell In a manner that "tickled
tho toes" of every listener In whom
there ran the blood of tho Celt. Little
Anna Collins. Mary Klrwin and Cath-
orlno Brown enthralled their listeners
by tho sweetness of their playing,
wnust tno violin duo by Morot. played
by Misses Tollo nnd Mnlone, n pleco of

tho Board of Education Friday night
n contract was given to the Kirk &

.Miss Murjorlo Kelly of St. Joseph,
Mich., was selected as German teach
er for tho ensuing year to take tho
place which will be made vacant by
-the resignation of Miss Margaret
Hahcrman. Miss Sue Settle of Owen
ton, Ky., was selected as one of tho
grade teachers for the ensuing year to
fill a vacancy which will be announced
later.
It was also decided that the bacca
laureate sermon this year would bo
given In the High School nudltorulm
Instead of nt a local church. This step
was taken because of tho fact that the
auditorium Is larger than any of tho
churches and tho crowd of interested
persons who always attend can bo accommodated.

DAY
It should be a record breaking day with us because we have a very large stock of merchandise which is
NOT marked at the prevailing war prices. Just as long as we can hold prices down we arc going to do it,
though the big New York manufactures are urging us to take advantage of the conditions of today.
No store can sell you Rugs, Carpets, Mattings, Linoleums, Shades and Lace Curtains at the prices we are
selling them and make money, nor will we duplicate any of these items at the same prices.
Our stock of Shoes and Oxfords arc marked 24 per cent. BELOW the Shoe market. Our Hosiery and
Underwear are still at the old prices. Our Suits, Coats, Dresses, Skirts, Petticoats, Muslin Underwear, Mil
linery, Kimonas and House Dresses arc marked at old prices. ,
Compare our prices with any store in the world and you will come back to the Big Store of Maysvillc.
