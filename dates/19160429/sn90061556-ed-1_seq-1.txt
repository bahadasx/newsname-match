BIG CHORUS RENDERS
HIAWATHA
Jackson Scores Another. Hit.
ALLEN CHAPTERFILLEDTO HEARSINGEI1S
By CHAS. A. STARKS.
Can anyone imagine anything more
weird and touching than the prelude
played aa Introductory to the Wedding'
Feast of Hiawatha? Hiawatha, son
of Mudjekuwls of the West Wind and
the beautiful Wenokah, daughter of
old Nokomls, who fell from the full
moon,
"Down thru the evening twilight
In the days that are forgotten."
There was a great chorus to take
up the narration of the wonderful
Wedding Feast, which had begun so
gloriously with orchestra batoned by
N. Clark Smith in his graphic and
inimitable style.
Despite the natural, beautiful, ro
mantic and appealing wlldness of
Longfellow's poem, It enjoyed but
little popular form until one S. C. T.,
Son of Africa, kissed It with his magic
wand of music and Hiawatha became
a living dream. The characters and
scenes are possibly peculiar to Red
men, but the music of the composer
makes their souls black by the touch
of Africa's muse.
The Harp of Ethiopia Is brought
from the land of tho morning the
land of the setting sun, brought to give
a now language to the sunshine of
the meadow, the shadow of the forest,
the wind among the branches'.
Then it was another brilliant Cole
ridge Taylor evening. The spirit of
his music was rampant. Taylor was
just as much alive as If he was there
in person. Time, Friday, April 21;
place: Allen Chapel, which was amply
PROF. ROBT. G. JACKSON
Who so successfully conducted
"Hiawatha" last Friday evening at
Allen Chapel.
filled by music lovers ot the city. The
historic meeting place was alive with
a great throng listening to weird
chants, swelling volume and the
mighty pitch ot voice, string, piano
and organ vleing and soaring above
the lofty columns of the building.
We are told that Prof. Jackson
tackled this difficult work with some
natural apprehension as to its musical
success under prevailing conditions.
But the verdict of the audience would
no doubt pronounce his effort as one
decidedly happy, and thus another
star in his profusely decorated Corona
which he wears with perfectly un
affected modesty. Then it was a suc
cess.
Those contributing In special roles
were: N. Clark Smith, who presided
over the Orchestral Division; Miss
Beulah Douglass, Organist; Miss
Joyce Dorsey and Miss Eva Moore,
as Pianists, and such local talent as
this high-class trio: Miss Elite Grant,
Soprano; Prof. F. J. Work, Tenor, and
Mr. Lemuel Russell, Baritone. These
handled the difficult singing roles.
As a relief against tho first and last
parts of Hiawatha Mrs. Emma Payne
sang a number from J. Rosamond
Johnson entitled "Since you went
away' Nover was song rendered
with such plaintive dreariness. There
was not the slightest tremor In" the
' singer's voice as she Interpreted for
the audience the meaning ot the
pathos of a heart who feels tho ab
sence of a beloved one sung in per
feet accents, exact and rich with
touching sympathy. Too bad there
-was no place for this singer In Hla-
watha proper. Her second number,
was an Innovation, "I heard the voice
of Jesus Say," sung to the tuno of
"Dearest Memories," by Vodery. This
was well received.
"Steal awav to Jesus" was rendered
by tho Chorus with N. Clark Smith
directing. This number was charac
tnrlRtlc and discovered some clever
tone maneuvering under the sharp
baton of the director.
"Tho' Crucifixion," one of Smith's
own 'compositions was pleasingly ren
dered by the Chorus with Jackson dl-
rectlng. '
"Oh, the long and dreary winter!
Oh. tho cold and cruel winter!," The
disconsolate themo Is now taken Up
The chorus gives a fair Interpretation
singing as oven as could be expected
Indeed, one could see the effect of
Jackson's drilling In every turn. Tho
rendition was all that could be asked
under tho circumstances and we call
your attention to the unusual ability
of Prof. Jackson In training voice and
hand. Every local student should take
advantago of Jackson's genius to Im
part thoroughly the higher perception
of music to those who would learn.
The writer notices the fine spirit of
relationship that exhibits Itself be
tween teacher and student. It must
bo pleasant for thoso privileged to
study in such an atmosphere of con
geniality nnd profitableness. Those
who want voice culture, those who
would understand the fundamental
manipulation of tho piano and Its
technique, those who would bo a part
of the great musical organization. See
R. O. Jackson at his studio. Join his
class. Become of the elected, initiated
Into the Inner science of music the
harmony of tone and color.
Dr. Theo. Smith's Easter open
ing was the largest, grandest
and most successful in the his
tory of his business. All
classes were represented from
school principals to washer wo
men, nnd laborers. Dr. Smith
Is popular among all classes be
cause he plays no favorites. Tho
servant and working classes get
as much consideration as the
professional or wealthy class.
Dr. Smith came here a few
years ago with less than Five
Hundred Dollars and today his
assets runs up into the thou
sands. His word and indorse
raent means something among
the best white people. We need
more race men like him.
PATRONS' DAY AT LINCOLN
SCHOOL.
The annual patrons' day at Lincoln
school will be held next Wednesday,
May 3. An elaborate exhibit of the
year's work will be on display In each
of the rooms and in the domestic
science and manual training depart
ments. A special feature of the dis
play will be the handwork of the va
rious classes. The millinery work of
the seventh grade pupils under Miss
Clara V. Lynden has been made a
great success this year and each par
ent has sent to the teacher a special
letter of thanks and congratulations.
This work will be on display.
The Kindergarten exercises will be
gin at 11 o'clock, luncheon will be
served in tho school cafeteria and dur
ing the afternoon there will be sing
ing, games, drills and folk dances on
tho school grounds.
It is always a great comfort to one
to know they're kindly remembered
by dear friends after many months
ot lingering illness and the kindly
felt appreciation Is better expressed
by one who is "truly the recipient at
this time. Such Is the case of Mrs.
Frances Wilson who was so kindly re
membered by the following friends at
Easter time: Mrs. Charlotto Vlre, a
potted Easter Illy; Mrs. Benj. Brnx-
ton, a potted Martha Washington ge
ranium; Mrs. Mllo Hawkins of Wash
ington, Ind., a large box so heavily
lawen with lovely serviceable cloth
ing from the daintiest lingerie, pretty
dollies and so forth to the richest
silk and velvet ready to wear cos
tumes, the outfits completed with two
stunning hats that would arouse the
envy ot any of our artistic milliners.
Mrs. Wilson in her pleased air ot as
tonishment and thanks only says:
Praise God from whom all blessings
flow."

EASTER
The Owl's Easter Ball
Prizes Won in Swell Dressing.
"Monday's Dance at Wright's Academy
Went Big.
Prof. Dude Knox's orchestra was
playing one of those all engulfing
schottlsches, such as "Down Among
the Sheltering Palms," when 200 cou
ples swayed to and fro, now here and
now there, walking and skipping, now
close locked and "seasldlng" with the
music as the graceful waving ot wa
ters. Four hundred feet raised In uni
son, running forward, now aside,
wheeling and turning all to the tune
of some stirring and catchy rag.
It was the night of the Owls. Their
weekly Monday night ball. Over 400
people were there. Every attendant
more or less dressed to death In some
new tangled Easter creation. Every
mother's son and daughter seemed to
"have 'em." There were prizes of
fered for the two best dressed ladles
present. Every fair one In the hall
was a brilliant contender and the con
test was finally and agreeably settled.
A genteel good time was In vogue
for everyone. The stellar lights of the
Owls were there. That prince ot en
tertainers, Marshall Rodgers, was
there. Steve Lane, the joy dispenser;
Jim Carter, the personage who is
about, and the "Yellow Peril," better
know as "Jap" the Oriental Kid, a
popular favorite.
There was not a dull moment. The
hall was decorated for the occasion,
the music was good and the terpsl
chorean devotees danced till 1 o'clock.
AH of which Is another reason why
Wright's academy Is the best.

MRS. BESSIE M. WEAVER
Kansas City's popular florist, who
delivered the following address before
the National Negro Business League
In Boston, August 20, 1915:
The Business Opportunities Offered
Colored Women in the Florist Busi-
"I have-been so busy out there on
the floor of the convention trying to
get life and annual memberships, ds
you requested, Dr. Washington, that
I have almost forgotten the few words
I Intended to say on this Important
subject. I want briefly to speak of
the opportunities offered tho women
of our race In the florist business.
This Is a big, undeveloped field, which
should especially appeal to a woman
and it Is one of the most profitable
enterprises a woman can engage In.
I have found it to be very interesting
work and as healthful as it Is interest
ing. Be it said to the credit of our
race, our people have always been
lovers of music and flowers. They
buy lots of flowers, especially for
funeral purposes, to say nothing of
weddings, entertainments, table deco
rations, yard and garden use In the
matter of bulbs and plants, graduating
exercises and for a number of, other
purposes that will easily occur to you.
When I made my first report to you
at the Philadelphia meeting, I was the
only Negro florist In Kansas City,
Missouri, but since that time there
have been two other ladies engaged in
the same line of work. And we are
succeeding In educating and inducing
our people as well as others to buj
flowers for Christmas gatherings and
entertainments, Easter greetings,
Mother's Day, flowers to be used in
the home, in the church, In the Sun
day school, In the hospitals, at wed
dings, as well as for funeral designs.
So you see this is a business that can
be profitably conducted the year
round, and the nature of which is ad
mirably suited to womanly endeavor.
Here In Boston there is a splendid
opportunity. Indeed there Is an oppor
tunity for us In any section of this
country for pretty, well grown flowers
never draw the color line. The busi
ness requires comparatively small
capital start for as Dr. Washington
has said "you can begin at the bot
tom" and gradually increase your
stock and equipment until you are well
established. Another feature of this
business which Is not true of the aver
age mercantile venture and that Is
your flowers grow even while you are
asleep and the forces of nature are
In league with you in your endeavor
to succeed; when the men, when the
merchant closes his doors for the
night his Income ceases, his stock Is
depreciating In value; the air and
sunshine and moisture and the gentle
rain from Heaven mean but little to
him as an asset, but to the florist they
mean much, and even when the florist
retires, the buds will, burst forth and
blossom In tne night. In connection
with my florist establishment I con
ducted a laundry agency which helped
to tide me over the operating expenses
and enabled me to make money from
the very beginning. I would not ex
aggerate the profits to be made in this
business at first for it takes time to
grow plants and flowers, there are ex
penses to be met, and It also takes
time to win trade and build up any
kind ot lucrative business but I know
of no business more suited to women
and which promises an almost certain
profit it rightly conducted than the
florist business. The propagation of
plants enables you to tako one plant,
for Instance a geranium, and from
that one plant you can root a dozen
or more potted plants after a little in
struction. Many florists of this coun
try have grown rich In the business
owning greenhouses and equipments
that run up Into the hundreds of thou
sands of dollars and a large number
of them I can name started In a
very humble way. Why can't we do
likewise?' (Applause). Now I hope
when this league meets In Kansas City
next year (applause) we will be able
to hear reports from quite a number
ot our young women to the effect that
they have embarked and are succeed
ing in this same line of work. You
havo a crowded program and there
fore I shall not detain you further. I
thank you." (Hearty applause).
Mrs. Cox ot Boston, Mass., said: "I
want to correct Mrs. Weaver by say
ing that wo have a young woman who
Is in tho florist business right here in
Cambridge."
Mrs. Weaver replied: "I am delight
ed to know that,"
It also developed that young col
ored women were engaged In the flor-
1st business In Seattle, Wash., and CC
hassett, Mass.
Dr. Booker T. Washington said:'
"We will contlnuo tho discussion ot
the subject 'The Beauty Parlor Busi
ness,' the next speaker being Madam
Kary L. Johnson, wife of Dr. W. Alex
ander Johnson, who Is president of
the Boston Negro Business League."

COLOR AND WORK.
It was a happy thought to have half
a dozen dark-faced men supply music
in advance of Mr. Moorfleld Storey's
address before the New England Dry
Goods Association. That body had
gathered to hear his plea for a fairer
distribution ot industrial opportunities
among our colored citizens, and tho
orchestral performance significantly
anticipated the lesson he came to
teach. What the guests heard was
music, and there is no color in music.
None Is injected by the score sheets
or even by the Instruments; piano,
violin, cornet and drum give out in
an absolutely unprejudiced manner tho
notes required ot them. The musi
cians, differ as they may in skill, show
no peculiarity which can be traced to
"race, color or previous condition of
servitude." You can not tell by mere
listening whether they were born
North, South, East or WesL "Ameri
ca" and "The Star Spangled Banner"
sound the same whosoever touches tho
keys, bows the strings or supplies the
"wind." And if there is no color in
music, why should there be color in
work?
That question is raised by the dec
laration which has just gone forth
from about 1,500 of Boston's best
known residents announcing their will
ingness "to be served by colored sales
people and other colored employes,
wherever found competent for the du
ties assigned them," and adding the
request that "opportunity be given to
colored applicants for positions to
demonstrate their fitness for employ
ment." This can only mean It is In
tended to mean that our colored men
and women are being slighted In tho
distribution of certain kinds of work.
And yet a good -deal of disinclination
to try them out, as Mr. Storey more
than hinted .arises out ot a supposition
rather than out of a fact. The em
ployer Is bound to avoid giving of
fense to his customers, but does not
always tako the trouble to And out
how many ot them would be "offend
ed." That 1,500 citizens havo taken
tho trouble to disclaim nil sensitive
ness In tho matter should servo to
"encourage the others." A reasonable
share in tho clty'B Industrial and com
mercial opportunities Is the right of
all our people, irrespective of class,
color or creed. Boston Herald,
