certain that the day has come for
the taxpayers to realize their op
portunity and, for that reason they
predict an overwhelming victory
for those favoring the tax.
With $50,000 it is argued the
Plaquemine farmers will have
enough money to put every acre of
land in the entire district within
striking distance of one of the lat
erals proposed in the . system. y
this means every farm will be'
tloroughly and systematically
drained, and, the farmers. of the
Plaquemine district will reap
enough profits. from lands, which
are not being cultivated at present,
on account of lack of drainage, to
pay the taxes on the entire place,
besides making allowances .for a fat
pocket book,
A house to house campaign has
been made and every, argument in
favor of the proposition has been
put up to the taxpayers. Every
taxpayer knows exactly how much
-his taxes will be, about what profit
they will 'derive from their lands,
and on account of these reasons
the progyessive farmers of Plaque
mine Point will present a solid
front on May 116th and will practic
ally unanimously vote' in favor of
the measure..
