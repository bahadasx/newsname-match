SLEEPER INDORSED
BY WELFARE LEAGUE
Citizens Organization Approves
Candidacy of Bad Axe Man
In Lively Session.
Detroit Free Press, Apr. 23.
In a lively session at Hotel Statler
Saturday evening the Citizens' Wel
fare league of Michigan carried a mo
tion to indorse the candidacy of Albert
E. Sleeper, of Bad Axe, for governor
It the state.
' Regarding the indorsement of Mr.
Sleeper, Mrs. J. K. Gailey, founder ot
the league, said: "We are standing
behin Mr. Sleeper because he stands
for the same humanitarian movements
which the league is fighting for. He
stands for an honorable, efficient, busi
ness administration carrying out the
will of the people and looking out for
their best interests.
"With the regard to the need for an
administrative board for state institu.
tions Mr. SleeDer thinks as the Citizen's
Welfare League, that it is high time
that an efficient, sociologically intelli
gent body was formed to care properly
for the moral and physicial well being
of the thousands of individuals in state,
penal and charitable institutions, and
to provide room for the feeble-minded
now abroad in the state propagating
their kind for the state later to look
after."
With the final decision to stand back
of Mr. Sleeper came the announcement
of plans for immediate opening of
headquarters from which the league
will further the cause of their candi
date and will inaugurate a campaign to
secure thousands of signatures to a
petition praying that the 1917 legisla
ture pass the bill creating a board of
administration for state institutions for
which the league is sponsor.
Speakers for the evening were Dr.
Guy L. Kiefer, chairman of the public
health committee of the State Medical
association, who urged the league to
get back of the district health officers
bill or a similar measure to provide
qualified full-time full-pay health offi
cers throughout the state, and Geo. M.
Clark, of Bad Axe.
ELBERT BEDE SAYS
Who can name off hand all the presi
dents of Mexico since Diaz?
Villa has all the refined and delicate
ways of a mongrel jackal and hyena.
We often make politics a matter of
charity and then wonder why taxes are
high.
The woman who chews the rag has
no right to criticize the man who mas
ticates tobacco.
We believe the income tax should
reach those with incomes just a notch
higher than ours.
The republican bosses will agree to
any kind of a platform this year for
what's the use of being a boss if theres
nothing to boss.
Talk about a married woman being
the boss. Nine cases out of ten she
isn't half as much boss after marriage
as she was before.
With the parcel post limit at fifty
pounds, subscribers of country news
papers have no excuse for not paying
their subscriptions.
If kisses are poisonous, perhaps they
act as their own antidote. That's the
only way we can account for our own
repeated escapes from a terrible death
It is often a good policy not to do a
thing about which you are doubtful but
how much progress would this old
worf d have made if it all had followed
tha? nolirv.

Over in England the women refuse
to marry men who won't go to war.
" Evidently the women over there want

a matrimonial career.
The wise leap year girl always pre

BOOST MICHIGAN
Every Michigan merchant knows that
the prosperity of his town and the
value of his property is enchanced a
hundred fold by a productive, pro
gressive farming community, and he
should do everything he can to further
the interests of the farmer as well as
the manufacturer and the laborer.
Every Michigan farmer knows a farm
of one hundred acres of good land near
a prosperous town is worth many times
what it would be worth back twenty
five miles in the country, and yet some
farmers are buying goods from mail
order houses in other states hundreds
of miles away from their property in
stead of boosting their own town
through buying goods at home, thereby
creating greater prosperity in their own
community and automatically enchanc
ing the value of their own property.
Remember the balance or trade de
cides whether Michigan is getting rich
er or poorer. Every man in every
community is a factor in the prosperity
of Michigan. It makes a lot of differ
ence whether you are knocking or
boosting. It makes a lot of difference
whether you are trading in Michigan or
abroad.
The size of your town depends upon
the amount of business done in it and
you can't build up your town or your
State by trading hundreds , of miles
away, besides the outsider pays no
taxes in Michigan but on the other
hand is coaxing all the money he can
out of Michigan, drawing upon the re
sources of the State continuously and
is making Michigan poorer instead of
richer.
Whenever you have one dollar in
cash, or a hundred, to pay down for
merchandise of any kind, give your
merchant a change and if he doesn't at
least try to meet you half way he is not
made of the right kind of stuff but do
not expect him to quote you as low a
price on a small order to be charged
and carried on the books for from a
month to a year, as the outsider is will
ing to quote you on a large order for
cash in advance.
Michigan merchants and Michigan
peopie give-each other a show. Get
together and buy everything possible
in Michigan. Keep your money in circu
lation within your own range instead of
sending it hundreds of miles away to
help fill the coffers of those who are
only interested in what they can get
out of you and return nothing in par
ticular to your town or your community

MICHIGAN PEOPLE SHOULD CO

Immortalizing a King's Nose
If the nose of Cleopatra had been
shorter, as Pascal, the French philoso
pher, has said, the whole face of the
earth would have been changed. "But,
adds a writer in Cartoons Magazine,
"that an inch or two. or even three, in
the matter of the King of Bulgaria's
nose is all the same to the cartoonist,
will be evident from a survey of the
great gallery of caricatures which this
monarch has inspired. "The cartoon
ists have done nothing except immort
alize King Ferdinand's nose. There
have ""been famous noses in history.
Cyrano de Bergerac was blessed with
one, Ferdinand's nose, however,
threatens to go thundering down the
balls of time.

Arbor and Bird Day
Proclamation By the Governor
Long years ago a loyal Michigan citizen planted hundreds of
maples on either side of the highway fronting his large farm.
These trees are now large and beautiful. These trees did not
affect the productivity of his farm. When he planted these
trees he had in mind the thousands of men, women and children
who would receive real joy from his gift to this "main traveled
road." Some day both city and country will come to appreci
ate the importance of tree-planting along the highways, on the
hillsides, in yards and in parks.
Trees without birds would get lonesome. , Trees and
shrubs are the natural homes of many of our birds. These
winged creatures are man's best friends. They not only de
stroy millions of destructive insects, but they appeal to man's
sense of beauty, in their plumage, in their song and in their
graceful movements.
The trees and the birds teach "mutual aid," teach a univer
sal poetry, teach the beneficence of the Father of us all.
Therefore, I, Woodbridge N. Ferris, Governor of the State
of Michigan, do hereby designate Friday, May 5th, 1916, as Arbor
and Bird Day, and do request that this day be observed by all
schools, public and private, and other educational institutions by
the planting of trees for beautifying school grounds and parks,
and by conducting suitable exercises for promoting the spirjt of
protection to trees and birds.
Given under my hand and the Great Seal of the State, this
twenty-fourth day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand
nine hundred and sixteen, and of the Commonwealth and eightieth. -

By the Governor: Governor.

East Jordan This Week.
Will Leave
for Spring Lake
Harry Potter and Ray Fox Have
Purchased Garage.
East Jordan is about to lose two of its
popular citizens who have found a good
business opening at Spring Lake and
will leave for there, with theirfamilies,
in a few days. Harry Potter, who has
been our postmaster for the past four
years and grew to manhood in our
midst, and Ray Fox, the popular R. F.
D. Carrier on Route 5, have decided
that the business opportunity present
ed them at Spring Lake is a good one,
and, have purchased the Garage and
Lunch Room in that village, which is
near Grand Haven.
Their going is a matter of sincere
regret to their many friends here.' Both
gentlemen are public-spirited citizens
and are a valuable asset to any com
muniiy.
School Commissionpr's
Notes
May L. Stewart, Commissioner
Ten real school visits and seven
school room calls made this week.
Clarion has a ventilating problem to
figure out. It will probably be a new
furnace with registers in the partition
eight feet from the floor replacing the
old floor dust fans.
The Deer Lake teacher is happy to
learn from her director that her boys
and girls may have new scats next
year.
The school district on East Chandler
hill has the biggest water supply
problem in the county. Their well is
300 feet deep and their wind mill failed
to give satisfaction. A cement cistern
with a supply hauled regularly has been
tried but it is difficult to keep it clean.
They are now debating on trying a
gasoline engine with which, to do their
pumping.
Clarion has purchrsed some master
pieces from Landseer and Mauve.
Miss Margaret Stroud of the Undine
School is now taking 7th and 8th grade
work and has not been absent or tardy
for eight years.
2G more Corn club contestants from
Eveline township on Friday the 21st.
The Star school has just had the first
closing day exercises in its history.
Salutatorian and validictorianboth gave
splendid addresses. The recitations
were well chosen and well rendered.
They called it 'Standard Plate' day and
had the commissioner there to talk on
that subject. A big potluck dinner had
made all happy before the program
began.
You ought to see the Boyne City Key
Stone set.
Pleasant Valley is to have a box
social on the 20th. 'They plan on a
Standard School program with varia
tions. See notice of the eighth grade ex
amination in another colnmn.
If all schools had the recommended
texts for uniform books every teacher
could profit the second year from her
first year's experience with the nature
of what she is to teach. That's just one
argument. It saves time.
There will be a big crowd of Charle
voix county teachers in the state nor
mals this summer. Three cheers for
the professional spirit of the teacher
who wants training and goes after it.
Already Given Out four hundred
certificates for those not absent or
tardy for four months. The supply in
this office is gone but more are order
ed. If your school lets out before the
new order gets here just send in the
names of the boys and girls deserving
them so that the commissioner may
send them their certificates when the
order arrives.
get a free ticket to the fair. j
In a thick forest the saplings are ;
weak and slender. What is natures
lesson to the school room?
To have what you want is wealth; to
do without is power.
If a man has money his funny stories
will always get a laugh.
The man who tells you he is no fool
may merely be mistaken.
A pretty girl finds nothing but pleas
ant reflections in her mirror.
And many a dear girl makes the mis-.
take of marrying a cheap man.
If a man has a true sense of humor
he knows when not to get funny.
ALONG THE FIRING LINE
Through an error Champ Clark found
himself the other night at a hospitable
table where some Republican Con
gressmen were giving a dinner. He
enjoyed himself hugely, the reports
say; and it is safe guessing that he was
much more agreeably placed than if he
'found himself at a board where there
might be a more pronounced emphasis
in favor .of the present occupant of the
White Ho"se.
It is significant that in every State
where a presidential preference vote is
taken and where the State is one
whose electoral vote is essential to win,
the Democratic vote invariably falls far
behind the Republican vote. It will be
the same when the conclusive presi
dential preference vote is taken in
November.
Japan is spending about $500,000
annually for paint for ships' bottoms.
The seamens law having driven the
last vestige of America foreign-going
tonnage from the high seas there is
nothing left for the American seamen
to paint but the town.
Mexico is to issue "fiduciary money"
to the amount of 500,000,000 pesos.
Like McAdoo's "Nei Balance," the
public is asked to take it on faith.
Meredith Nicholson, author of the
"Port of Missing Men," and other
works of fiction, has been spoken of as
assistant secretary of war to succeed
Henry Breckenridge, who resigned
with Garrison. Mr. Nicholson's train
ing in the world of letters commends
itself to Mr. Wilson, who is afflicted
with writer's itch. If the Children's
Bureau is ever vacated during Mr.
Wilson's administration, he will pro
bably appoint Laura Jean Libbey to
that position. This is a pen and Ink
administration.
Seven years ago a Republican Secre
tary of State tried to have Congress
establish the office of Under Secretary
but the highly democratic Democrats
reared up and denounced the scheme
as a patterning after the effete monar
chies of Europe. So, while the job was
established, the title given to it was
that of Counsellor. Now the Demo
crats have brought in a bill to change
the name of the place to Under Secre
tary. It is a small matter, perhaps,
but, taken with all the other Republi
can notions which Democrats nowadays
are adopting, it is worth noting.
An amendment to the sugar bill, of
fered by Senator Lodge, provided for
a 'tariff on dyestuffs, a measure of
legislation which has the approval of
Democrats and Republicans alike, out
side of Congress. The Democrats vot
ed it down, of course. The dyemakers
will have to possess their souls with
patience until 1917. This action of the
Senate is a pretty certain indication
that there will be no attempt on the
part of the House Democrats to bring
in a protective dyestuffs tariff. The
Hill bill will go into the discard for this
Congress.
Merchandise left the port of New
York April 6th to the value of $15,356,-
000, for France, Itlay and Great Bri
tain. Of this total, horses brass and
wheat made up $12,000,000. The re
mainder was automobiles, chemicals,
explosives, etc. And Doctor Pratt
denies that our exports are swollen
chiefly by war orders.
