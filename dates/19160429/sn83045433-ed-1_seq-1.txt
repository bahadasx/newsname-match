Hugh 1. Scott and Frederick Funston, I
using the private car which brought them
here from San Antonio, as headquarters,
are busy tonight planning the final de
tails for the conference over the Mexi
can situation, and will make their first
official call upon Gen. Obregon tonight
at the Juares custom house.
Mexican Minister of War Obregon, in
his private car just across the Rio
Grande at Juares. is waiting with digni
lied, if not exaggerated serenity, for the
distinguished American officers to call
on him. By this official visit. which is
Obregon's due as a cabinet officer, the
proceedings will have been started.
The first session of the conference
will be held in the Juares custom house
tomorrow morning. It is expected the
conference will last until the middle of
next week, if not longer. "It will prob
ably take us four or five days to place
before Gee. Obregom all of the matters
we expect to take up with the de facto
government," said Gen. Funston.
"We expect that Gen. Obregon, from
time to time during the conference, will

other leaders. This may cause additional
delays en account of the slow communi
catdsa between the border and Mexico
City.

newspaper correspondents were received.
In answer to questions the minister of
war asserted, each time with a laugh,
that perfect harmony existed between
him and First Chief Carransa.
Gen. Scott and Funston arrived at 5:13
p. in. and were surprised to learn that
Obregon had arrived ahead of them. The
American generals were met by Gen.

In the meantime, the reports go on to p

Hostility against Americans is reported
