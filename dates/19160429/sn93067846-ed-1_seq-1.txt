baa no children, but 1? Interest?
ed In other people's particularly of the
poor. Wo know a school In Kershaw
county that was located to please one
wain. The school was entirely on one
side of the district, and sll because
the county hated to lose a little house
they had put there, unable to hold it
on account of c flaw In the title.
They need a county superintendent
with backbone and gumption. There
are similar oases In this county, the
school building convenient to those
who have conveyance and inconven?
ient to the poor. This ought not to
be. The man who will do violence to
his own good Judgment for political
pull Is not fit for the place.
We have seen representatives from
all the communities named in that
letter save Rembert and all are in
favor of the get-together picnic,
at Dinktne' Mill. It will be purely a
non-political gathering, but if any
politician desires to button-hole a
man on the grour ds he ean do so.
The meeting Is for the benefit of the
farmer, particularly of the small farm?
er. It Is intended to have leading
men of the various avocations of life
from your city present and it is de?
sired that they be brought into vital
touch with these, the bone and sinew
of any country.
It is to be a basket picnic, every ono
to bring s basket and thus have plenty
of grub on hand, thus Insuring that
the Inner man do r ot suffer. There is
s saw mill here and a table of any
length can be easily built. There aro
plenty of quiet shady walks for (who
said anything about billing doves?)
cooing doves. Some body says doves
don't walk much. Country doves do,
they walk a lot There's plenty of wa?
ter and plenty of shade.
Small grain Is suffering, with plenty
of cotton In the ground awaiting the
shower.
One of the most puthctlc, if not
amusing nights Is to sec that fellow

I Washington, April 25.?The latest
I British note in answer to American
j protest against allied interference with
neutrals, made public tonight at the
state department, contends that the
"practices complained of are judi
cally sound and valid' and that the
relief which neutrals seel; is rather
to be obtained by the mitigation of

changes either in the theory or appli?
cation of a policy based upon princi?
ples of international law carefully ad?
justed to the altered conditions of
modern warfare."
It discloses that an impartial and
influential commission" has been ap?
pointed to find ways to minimize delays
and pledges the allies to make their
restraints on trade as little burden?
some to neutrals as possible.
The note, in which the French gov?
ernment concurs, reiterates the mili?
tary necessity of regulating commerce
to neutrals contiguous to Germany and
justifies the effectiveness of the block?
