Howto Subjugate High-Speed Power, the Problem—3400 r. p. in. Chalmers, the Answer
The primary objecfrof high-speed engines for motor
cars was the attainment of great racing speed.
The hardest thing in building them was to make
them safe.
Another difficulty was to combine high engine
speed with the feature of all-round performance which
is in such imperative demand.
Now comes the remarkable 3400 r. p. m. Chalmers
which attains the terrific and supreme engine speed of
3400 revolutions per minute, not only with absolute
safety, but with undreamed-of acceleration, and smooth,
throbless serenity of performance.
Strength of materials, compact bearing and radia
tion surfaces, and copious lubrication, are the out
standing features of construction that make this a safe
high-speed engine.
By toning down the original might of this whizz of
an engine, to a point where the average man or woman
dare drive, the elimination of its superfluous energy
has been translated into supreme pick-up, velvet
smoothness of performance, and an annual saving of
from $150 to $200 in gas.
Yet it has speed— anything up to 60 miles an hour—
as fast as I care to travel in any emergency.
Every gallon of gas I put into the tank of my 3400
r. p. m. Chalmers comes through with 18 miles of
sparkling going.
it's fortunate that this magnificent new Chalmers
comes to us just when it does. Just now the South
is buying motor cars faster than ever before. Our
cotton, steel, munitions, and textile industries are
sending the smoke of prosperity into the heavens.
The South is more motor-conscious than ever be*
fore. The discriminating are buying Chalmers. Bring
a blank check when you come to see and feel the 3400
r. p. m. Chalmers perform.
Chalmers output is enormously increased. Today
deliveries are certain, with slight, if any, delays. But
a few weeks hence the dearth of raw materials may
curtail the supply of cars. Order now, if you
can.

Lights Entire Room
Y OU can read in any part of the room
with this wonderful kerosene mantle
lamp. The hand decorated fancy satin white shade
is so designed as to produce a semi-indirect effect.
It's a pleasure to do eyening reading, writing or
sewing under the white, soft mellow light of this
Fancy
Hanging
Lamp
It bums common coal oil (Kerosene), without odor,
smoke or noise. Anyone can operate it. Govern
ment tests and scientist at leading Universities show it
gives twice the light of the best round wick, open flame
lamps and yet bums less than half the oil. The Aladdtn
was awarded Gold Medal at the Panama-Pacific Exposition.
