Tin1 County Agent, or Aurieulinr-
alist. is the CiiUliei't ill' link between
the fanner and the work of the
United States Department of Agri
culture, as well as the work of the
State College and experimental farm.
Questions of farming nature will lie
settled liy the agent and he will de
vote his entire time In solving of
dilliciilt matters that may .u.'l the
fanner, orcliar.lman. stockman or
poiillrynian, as well as v every
cITort to instruct the new comers In
(his sort imi in the best, manner of
planting and raising Hie adaptable
props.
While it is not. expected that the
agent can answer elf hand all ques
tions that will arise in his work he
will bi in a position to secure the
best knowledge of the country on tin'
matter and if necessary will take
up the question directly with the
Department of Agriculture. It
would be impossible to secure as a
county agent a man who was a
specialist in all matters pertaining
. to the farm but tin' man secured
will be one of a broad general
knowledge of farming matters and
one who will take pains to comply
with every reasonable request of Ids
fanner constituants.
Another work of the county agent
is tbo determination of new crops,
and the best variety of seed for the
generally raised crops, for the com
munity. This will be done with the
cooperation of the farmers them
selves. It is not Uio idea to start
on experimental farm but to allow
the farmers to plant, from time to
time, an acre, or ten acres, of some
crop which it is believed will be of
benefit to the country. The result
of these plantings will be careful
ly recorded and any resident of the
county will havo access to these re
ports. The county agent will spend five
days of the week in the field, mak
ing trips up and down the county,
meeting and advising the farmers
and holding meetings whenever de
sired by the communities which ho
is to visit. One day of the week will
bo devoted to office work and on that
day his ofllce, which will be located
in Clayton will be open to the gen
eral public.
If a suitable, room can be secured
It is highly probable that the room

Democrats of nalional prominenco
in Wa-biiiiitou and other sections
of the I nit.il State- are keenly in-ere-te,
in Ihe political situation in
New Mexico, and at tinting on the
Democratic voters here to put the
state securely in the Democratic
column at the election in November.
.Ind-e l.au'-hliu told tl l that the
i:, , munition of the i Lht kind of a
ticket meant a Democratic victory
in New Mexico in the fall, and ex
pressed couiiileiice lhat the strong
est ni, u in the parly would be nam
ed as candidates this enr.
At the conference of Democratic
stale chairmen political conditions
and prospects in the various states
were report -d, and general plans to
he followed in conducting the 1910
campaign were discussed. The meet
ing was entirely informal, and a gen
eral exchange of ideas lhat proved
valuable to every one of the thirsty
chairman present resulted. In addi
tion to Ihe heads of Ihe state organization-,
several widely known Dem
ocratic leaders participated in the
coiifeiei , tin' number including
losepliiis Daniel.-, secretary of tho
navy, John Hurke, treasurer of the
United Slates; Senator OUie M.

Doreinus, of Michigan, chairman of
the Democrat ii' congressional com
mittee. Unbounded enthusiasm was
evidenced, and the most, aggressive
tactics in connection with tho work
of the Democratic slab: committees
this year were advocated.
V'i'resident Wilson was the principal-speaker
at the Jefferson Day
banquet and it is expected that sev

address will be sent to New Mexico
, for distribution by the state central
committee. The other speakers wero
congressman Carter Glass, of Vir
