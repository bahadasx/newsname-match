the actual tremendous scenes shown
on the screen. Incredible mental pic
tures of the obstacles triumphantly
overcome by Its authors, managers, di

making the production possible and
recording permanently on the photo
film the history of 50 years ago.
We learn from the official program
that there are over 6000 scenes In
the "Birth of a Nation." that 10,000
people and 3000 horses were utilized:
that It took eight months to complete
the picture; that 5000 reports on the
history of the civil war and the years
immediately following It were search
ed for authentic data by specially en
gaged experts; that every piece of
ordnance and musketry is an exact re
production; . that Ford's theater in
Washington was rebuilt In replica to
reproduce the scene of Lincoln's as

burned by the Invaders; that West

of the Ku Klux Klan were produced
at the cost of $10,000 a day for the

duels were fought with hundreds of
shells costing $80 each, and that the
approximate cost of the production

be Inclined to take these statements
with the grains of salt which nearly
