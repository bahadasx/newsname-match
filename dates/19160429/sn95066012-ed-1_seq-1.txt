HOME RULE CAUSE SET BACK
Irish in America Who Inspired Plot
False to Boti Adopted and Native
Land.
London, April 21). John Kedmond,
the leader of the Irish nationalisto in
the House of Commons, last night gave
the Associated l'ress the following
statement concerning the uprising in
Dublin.
'My first feeling, of course, on i. w.--
ing of ta; insane movement, was one
of horror, discouragement, ami almost
espair. I nsKed my self w bother
Ireland, as so often before In her
tragic history, was to dash the cup ot
liberty from her lips .u the insanity
of a small section ol her people once
igain to turn all her ma,-ve'cii ; ilc-
tories of (lie last tew yeais into irre
parable defeat and to send her bi.ek,
on the very eve ft her final recogni
tion as a free nation, into another lotij
night of slavery, incalculable sinf'"
ing and weary and uncertain strui;:.'!
ing.
"Hut anyhow it was the opinion of
reland and :n:rily 1 need 1101 argi.o
the princ ',ie espe'tay wite. u'lyiniiy
;vho his profess. d himself a li ::ie
ruler, that the policy of Ireland must
be decided by Ireland herself. That
the principle which has been adopt
ed by the Irish race everywhere.
Millions ol our people in the Fnit
ed States anil elsewhere, whose gener
ous devotion helped us so largely to
win our victories for the motherland
of our race have always accepted it.
However bounteous their help, never
have they denied Ireland's right to
boose, her policy for herself. That
doetrmo has been contested only by
the very same men who today have
tried to make Ireland a cat's paw of
Germany.
"In all our long and successful
struggle to obtain home rule, we have
be 11 thwarted and opposed by that
same section, we have won borne rule
not through thorn but in spite of them.
This w icked move of theirs was their
last blow at home rule. It was not half
as much treason to the cause of the
allies as treason to the cause of home
rub'.
"This attempted deadly blow at
heme rule carried cm through this see
lion is made more) wicked, more inso
lent, by this fact that Germany plot
ted il. Germany organized it. Ger
many paid lor it.
"And tho final aggregation of this
movement is thi?; The misguided in
rane young men who have taken part
in this movement In Ireland have
risked, and some of them lost, their
lives. Hut what am I to say of those
men who have sent them into this in
sane and iinti-patriotie movement
while they have remained In the rafo
remoteness of American cities?
"As to the filial result: I do not
believe this wicked and insane move
ment will achieve its ends. The Ger
man ph t has failed. A majority of
the people of Ireland retain their
raininess, fortitude and unity. They
abhor ibis attack on their interests,
their rights and their 1 rim iples. home
rub' lias not been destroyed. It re
mains indestructible."
RELIEF SHIP GOES AGROUND

most gallantry, unfortunately failed,"
says the etllclal announcement. "Our

BY
"CLEAN-UP" CAMPAIGN
County Association Offers Prizes for
Photographs.
Cleanliness is -worth while. It pays
in health, comfort, beauty and money.
The case of the farmer who spent t!U
for paint for his buildings and then
sold his Tarm for $200 more than he
had previously asked, is an example of
how it pays to clean up. Unfortunate
ly, that farmer in question only paint
ed three sides of his buildings.
Cincinnati reaped huge profits from
the "Clean I'p Campaign." "One of
the discoveries made in the campaign
of H14 was that 80 or 90 per cent of
all fires in cities are caused by ac
cumulated rubbish in closets, attics.
basements, sheds, hehind billboards
and in like places. As a result of the
campaign of HU4 there was a reduc
tion in tire loss in Cincinnati the year
following of $000,000, the loss in the
year before being $1,341,348, and in
the year following $793,790. This was
almost cutting the first loss in two.
Mecatise of the reduction of loss there
came a reduction of insurance rates
in the business section of from 5 to 8
per cent, and an annual saving of
about $100,000 in fire Insurance prem
iums. As the "Clean Up and Paint
Up'' campaign for that year cost the
city only about $10,0oi, there was a
net profit in that one item of fire in
surance premiums of $130,000. The
saving and profit in 1915 was yet
greater."
Neatness, cleanliness, orderliness
pays.
Every amateur photographer should
be interested in tho prizes offered by
the County Improvement Association
for the best photographs showing a lo
cation before and after cleaning up.

Y. M. C. A. SOCIAL
Last of Series foj the Season
Patronized.
is Well
Despite the many counter-attractions
last evening, 130 young people gather
ed at the "Y" for a social time. The
young women were in the majority,
and the institution might have passed
for a Y. W. C. A. to all appearances.
The games were the center of at
traction tho fore part of the evening,
and the ladies showed the skill which
they have acquired with the opportuni
ties for practice which the previous so
cials have furnished. This was par
ticularly true of the bowling.
The arrangements were in charge of
Mrs. Arthur J. Holdeu. chairman of
the Auxiliary Social committee, and
William H. Cone, chairman of the Soc
ial committee of the members. Mrs.
Collins M. Graves, Miss Mary Cone,
Mrs. George Hawks, Mrs. L. 11. Koss,
Mrs. Edward Dennett. Mrs. 11. II.
Webster, and Mrs. L. II. lloyce acted
as patronesses.
This will be tho last social of the
season, but as sure as fall comes, this
feature of the? Association life will he
revived.

Comfortable Glasses
Many persons do not buy glasses
when they need them, because they
fear the annoyance of wearing tliem.
Glasses skillfully fitted are as com
fortable as carpet slippers. Instead
of an annoyance, they are a source of
pleasure and case. No matter how
difficult to lit you are, there is a frame
or mounting here which, adjusted as
we know how to do it, Avill give you
the results you want.
We Specialize in Comfortable
Glasses.
