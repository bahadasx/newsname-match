The Consolidated Nev.-Utah mill
which was placed in commission' on
the 15th inst., has been riming cn an
average of over 23 hours per day
since the 17th Inst., and in one
stretch of 100 hours all units of
the plant were In operation without
a single stop.
According to Sup't VanWagenen,
zine concentrate has been drawn out
demonstrated to be 70 tons per day,
instead of 50 tons, called for in the
specifications.
Five Pioche Pacific R. R., cars of
zinc concentrte has been drawn out
of the mill since the hew plant was
started.. The ore entering the mill
is a mixture of mine product and
dumps the latter made during the
hand-sorting days.
The mine was re-opened on the
18th inst., when a small crew was
AVIATOR LEWIS MAY MAKE
HIS FLIGHT IN AUGUST
Tom McCormac lias received ad
vices from New York that B. B.
Lewis, a young sportsman of that
city, has not abandoned his attempt
to fly from San Diego to New York,
despire his shakeup when he land
ed in afield near Beaumont, Califor
nia, on March 30. which wrecked
fornia, on March 30 which wreck
ed his Wright H. S. biplane, tear
ing off the fusilage and reducing the
landing gear to matchwood.
Lewis immeditely wired the
Wright , company for spare parts
to make repairs, and was astound
ed at the information that there
would be over a month before they
could be made. As this -was contrary
to agreement with the manufactur
ers, Lewis returned to Los Angel
es to see Glen L. Curtiss about the
immediate purchase of a Martin ma
chine, only to find that the aviator
manufacturer had gone to , Wash
ington on receipt of a telegram
from Secretary of War Baker call
ing him into conference over the
Mexican situation; at, least from ev
ery angle.
' Lewis immediately wired the
de Kraft, that he was coming east
and the trip had been indefinite
ly postponed until he could secure
a machine capable of doing the
work. On his arrival in New York,
Lewis met Martin anl imaitdip.ttly
broached the matter of being sup
plied with a fast scouting aero
plane, equipped with a power plant
capable of standing the strain of
a trancontinental trip.
Martin Is now at iwork on plans
for a biplane, with two motors,
capable of developing 180 horse
power with minimum speed of 90
miles per hour. Such a machine will
cost 112,500 and will be deliver
ed in sixty days at Los Angeles.
It will be flown to San Diego by
Lewis, who will then start on his
transcontinental flight, following
the same route as originally decid
ed upon.
Since it was first made public
that Mr. Lewis intended attempting
anaeroplane flight from the Pacif
ic to the Atlantic, tremendous in
terest has been shown in cross-coun
try flying, which has been further
aroused by the work of the U. S
army aviators, with underpowered
Curtiss machines in "Mexico.
The American public has made its
displeasure felt In Washington and
aeronautical . engineers have . been
summoned to conference with de
partment heads, with the result
that before the year Is dead there
will' be a secretary. of aviation who
will have complete charge of the av
lation corps which will supply the
army and navy with machines and
flyers, but which will be as remote
from their rule as is the department
of state, . The signal corps, will very
properly, have nothing to do with
. the department of aviation!
Hitting the. iroa while it is hot
and making the sparks fly, is a spec
laity of the Aero' Club of America
With two live wires as Alan Haw
" ley. ; president, and Henry Wood
house, chairman of the board of
' governors, it is small wonder that
plans have been laid, for an ocean to
ocean race this summer. This will
. probably be held in August. i
Fine work
put on, working day shift, this crew
being able to provide a considerable
portion of the total feed to mill.
The mine ore is being sorted .to
prevent large pieces of clean' zinc
and lead ore fom entering the mill.
This ore is high grade, does not re
quire milling and will be shipped di
rect to the smelter for treatment.
Power is adequate at the mill
and all machines appear to be work
ing well. Considerable adjusting was
done on the concentrting tables,
which are still in -.process of being
made suitable for their work. As
soon as properly adjusted the ton
nage treated will be raised from
fifty to seventy tons per day.
Some experimenting, is still being
done with oils for flotation; the elec
tric lights are working satisfactori
ly and the plant is proving to be an
entire success.
One route that is largely followed
by the late Calbraith Perry Rodgers,
the first aviator to fly across the
North American continent, which he
did in 1911. Rodgers' route follow
ed the' Erie from New York to Chi
cago"; the Alton from Chicago to
Kansas City; the Katy from that
point to San 'Antonio; the Gulf line
from San Antonio to El Paso, and
the Southern Pacifiic to Pasadena,
flying from that point to Long
Beach, Cai., where he wet the
wheels of his machine in the waters
Of the Pacific.
Through the efforts of the Aero
'lub of America, a superb tropiiv
nd about jso.ooo in cash has ai-
ready been raised for a night frn
New York to El Paso. All entrants
wm nave to mane Denver one or in
stops on this' or other routes.
Efforts are being made to have
another route used which wiL fol- u-.wsiue iiweiuiun-. .
low the line of the Union Pacific to The Record has now one of the best, equipped newspa
Sait Lake City, thence the line of per plants in the state of Nevada and is prepared to put out
me &ac. iae -route 10 uo ao
and San Pedro or San Diego, do
peuding wholly on the amount of
iioney which can be raised.
Each entrant will be compellod to
stop for twelve hours at each con
trol, for rest; so that the man with
the slow machine will have the
knowledge that he will be tinaM for
the hours he is in the air, as well as
as the man with a space killer.' It
will resolve itself into a. question of
skill and nerve, to say nothing of
endurance. ,
From '. the manner ; in which the
people and communities , are, re-
sponding to requests for subscrip-
tlons, it would not be surprising if
more than ? 100,000 in prizes were
hung up. And Lewis was the man
who set the ball rolling, by awaken
ing public interest.
Glenn L. Martin will probably ea
ter two machines in the race, one of
which he will drive himself. Glenn
H. Curtiss will probably have a like
number of machines in the race, but
will not fly himself. What the other
manufacturers will do ' has . not yet
been announced. ' . '" .
The one thing which Is bete noir
of aviation, not only in this country
which is ten years 'behind the war
ring nations of Europe but abroad,
is an aeronautic motor. . A test will
be made in Washington next week,
of a recently inventedv welded mo
tor, the produet of the brain of a
western engineer, under the super
vision of the Navy Department,
which may prove to be the long
striven for answer. If this be the
case, it will immediately put the
United States in the van of aero
nautics, a place It should never have
been permitted to vacate.
It is no wonder that the foreign
governments are looking askance at
American made motors. One aero
plane manufacturer sold sixty ma
chines to Russia, none of which ever
left the ground, and the man who
made the sale Is In a Russian prison.
England is buying machines fn this
country, simply to teach men o fly
in, and John Bull figures that it
takes three American aeroplanes to
teach .one man to fly. then he is Dut
in a machine of English or French
make and sent to the front. While
it is true that the flying boat or sea
plane is the invention of an Anieri-
can, it is also true that few of the
warring nations are using machines
of this type built in the United

When the new fiscal year of
Uncle Sam begins next July, it is
expected that the new Department
of Aviation will be in operation and
that government orders . amounting
to $10,000,000. will be ready to be
placed. If this be a fact, the future
of aviation in this country is secure.
There are rumors in New York to
the effect that the Wright and Cur-
tiss companies are to be merged. If
this be the case, there will be a lot
of law suits facing the. other aero

Nevada Voters to Study
Recently there has been consider
able inquiry at to the dates on which
the registry books for the coming
elections will be open. The legisla
ture of this state, at the session of
1915, made many important changes
in the election laws, and there is a
liklihood of confusion, unless the
people familiarize themselves with
the new requirements.
Women Can Xow Vote
In the first place, all women in
Nevada of the ages of 21 years or
up .urd can vote at all elections
hereafter.
They do net have to give their
ages when registering. The mere
statement that "I am over il.e age
of 21 years" will be sufficient, and
all that the law requires as to the
age stipulation.
Section 8 of the new registration
law states that "A new registration
of the electors of this state shall be
made In the year 1916, within the
dates hereinafter prescribed, and ev
ery two years thereafter." In ac
cordance with this section It will be
necessary for every elector wishing
to vote at a general election, whether
he has been registered before or not,
to appear in person before the regis
try agent and register. His name
cannot be transferred from an old
register.
Some General Provisions
The following are some . of the
general provisions of the new regis
try laws:
No' person can vote unless his or
her name appears on the registry
list. '
Every citizen of the United States,
twenty-one years of age or over,
who will have continuously resided
In this Btate six months, and in' the
county or precinct thirty days next
preceding the day of the, next ensu
ing election, shall be entitled to
register.
If a person removes to another
state, territory or foreign country
with the ' intentira of remaining
there for an indefinite time, and as
a place of present residence, he
shall lose his residence in this state,
notwithstanding that he may enter
tain the intention of returning at
some uncertain future period; and
an occasional return, either for busi
ness purposes or pleasure, to the
place of his former abode in this
state, shall not be sufficient to pre
serve his residence therein.
Section 12 of the law provides
that it shall be the duty of registry
agents at any time when called on to
do so between the hours of 10 a. m.
and 6 p. m. on all legal days, from
and after the first day of July, and
up to and including the 20th day of
October prior to any general elec
tion, to receive and register the
names of all persons legally qualified
and entitled to vote at such election,
or who will have acquired a right to
vote at such election. For ten days
prior to the date set for the closing
of the register the registry agent
shall also, in addition to the hours
above noted, be in attendance at his
respective office and ready to r3e;is
ter at all times between the houis
of 7 and 9 p. m.
In precincts whereiu there is no
regularly qualified res stry agent it
is the duty of the eounr.y commis
sioners to appoint regitliy agents,
and it shall be the duty of the per
son appointed to qualify within two
days .after receiving notice of ap
pointment. In case of the failure
of such person so appointed to qual
ify, voters may be registered Bi any
other precinct within the county

cinct in which there shall not be at
least ten qualified electors, perma
nently residing therein at the time
notice of holding election therein
shall be given.

The Ballots
Official primary ballots will be fur
nished by the county clerk of each
county in the state. These ballots
will be much smaler than those for
merly used at primary elections, as
they will be about eight inches in
width and as long as ncessary.
Separate Ballots for Each Party
Separate ballots will be printed
for each political party, the ballots to
contain tne names or .tne party can
didates. They " will "be ' printed 'on
tinted paper, each party having a

ventions shall be held at the county
seats and candidates for county of
fices shall be nominated.
Caliente Man Forgot
A Caliente man remarked the
other day that everything has gone
up except postage stamps. But he
forgot about the revenue stamps
which Uncle Sam says we must paste
on all forms of legal documents.
Mrs. T. H. Franklin will entertain
at her homo this afternoon.
