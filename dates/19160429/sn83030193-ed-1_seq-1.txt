Disastrous Defeat of Brit

LONDON, April :D. Major Gen.
Charles Townshond, commander of
tlm British forces besieged at Kut-ol-Amara,
Mesopotamia, by Turkish
forces slnco last December, has sur
rendered. This Information was con
tained In a British ofllclal statement
Issued this afternoon.
The forcea surrendering were com
posed of 2,970 British and fi.OOO In
dian troops, the War Office an
nounced. Tho olllclnl statement added that
Gen. Townshond destroyed all his
guns and munition beforo surrender
ing. Beforo tho news of Gen. Town
shciid'H surrender came It was gen
erally believed In military circles that
ho would havo to givo In. Tho Kut-el-Aroara
garrison had withstood a
elego of MS days and was fuclng star
vation. Various attempts to get food
to tho troops proved unavailing.
Gon. Townshend'a force was flap
ped by th Turks at Kut-el-Amara,
105 miles southeast of Bagdad, early
last December, after the collapse of
tho IlilUsh campaign against Bag
dad. Pushing northward from tho Per
sian Gulf region, the British, under
Sir John Nixon, occupied Kut-el-Amara
on Snpt. 29, 1915, and then
advanced rapidly to Dlalah, within
ton miles of Bagdad. They were
beatnn back by a largo force of
Turks on Nov. 2C, 1915, and In their
retreat on Kilt sustained another
crushing defeat through the deser
tion of Arabian volunteors, who
turned traitors and Joined the Turks.
Gen. Nixon left Townshond with a
force ostlmaUal by thn Turk at 10,
000 men to hold Kut-el-Amara.
Tho town occupies a position at tho
bond of tho Tigris on rising ground.
A largo quantity of nuppllos was loft
with Townsltond's forces, but It was
believed that tho arrival of British
relnforcomont.i would onablo an ox
pedltlon to march to his relief within
u few weeks.
Gen. Nixon did not want to sur-
tender Kut-el-Amara to tho Turks
because the position, If strongly fortl-
fled by tbu Turks, would bar another
British advance on llugdad
Sir John Nixon was subsequently
relieved of command of the Mesopo
t.iiiilan forces because of the Bagdad
blunder, being succeeded by Sir Percy
Lake. British troops, reinforced by
veterans from the Dardanelles, then
began a march to relievo the ho
