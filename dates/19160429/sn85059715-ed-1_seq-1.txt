LONDON, April 29.?Although the
story of the early hours of the Dublin
uprising has now been disclosed
In considerable detail, England Is still
I without authentic information as to
the progress of later events. Normal
telegraph, telephone and mall service
with Ireland have not been resumed
and the existing means of communication
are subject to such strict censorship
that it Is possible to obtain
only fragmentary information. Such
news despatches as came through
j tills morning added little to the information
contained In last night's official
advices and stories of eye witnesses.
So far as official reports show the
situation In Dublin is gradually being
brought under control. The
most Important recent news that the
rebels had been driven out of St.
Stephen's Green with bombs sustaining
heavy losses in killed, wounded
and prisoners has not been con-}
firmed officially. There seems to be
no doubt, however, that the rebels
j still control vnrlous parts of Dublin
and that street lighting continues
with a lengthening list of casualties.
It is reported the casualty list already
exceeds 100. _
isl me situation outside (Dublin jlittle
is known beyond the ofllcial ad-..
mission that the disaffection has
spread to various localities in the I
] west and south of Ireland. Field
Marshal French's statement of last j
night described these disturbances as
local in character and so far as has
been revealed by information, which
has passed the censorship, they have
not been attended by heavy fighting.
REBELS STILL HOLD
CAPITAL OF IRELAND

DUBLIN, April 27, via London.
April 29?Fifteen hundred or so
armed men of the Sinn Fein had a'
hold on Ireland's capital today. After;
four days' of fighting their rebel flag j
still flow from a number of central I
points.
Since Monday some of the chief po-,
sltlons in the city have hen In tho
hands of the rebels. In defending
these strongholds against rebel
troops and Irish Nationalists volunteers
the rebels are fighting with desperation
for their lives, which they
know may be forfeited on account of
treason.
Regulars now command all the
rebel positions, the fal lot which is
merely a question of time.
When the Associated Press correspondent
landed early this morning
at the quay, the pinging of bullets
from rifles of snipers In the vicinity
was frequent. Augustine Blrrell, the
secretary for Ireland, had made the j
papernten. As he stepped ashore, ho
M shouted:
M "I wish you luck, gentlemen. I
don't know what will happen to you
