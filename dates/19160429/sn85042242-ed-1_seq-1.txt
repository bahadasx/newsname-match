ORGANIATION AGAIN
Stormy Debates Over Place of
Submersible in Modern
Warfare.
Washington, April 28.—Submarine
•warfare upon commerce was denounc­
ed by an array of prominent jurists
today, before the American Society
of International Law, concluding a
two-day urogram of addresses on
questions relating lo the European
Most of the speakers earnestly
favored restricting the use of the
submarines and the other new war
ugencius to established legal bounds,
rather than modification of the inter­
national code in their favor.
The tenth annual meeting of the so­
ciety will close tomorrow, with a bus­
iness meeting and a banquet at niKht,
at which Secretary Lansing, Judge
George Gray, David Hill and Prof.
George W. Kirchwey of New York
•will deliver addresses, lto-election of
Elihu Root as president, is expected.
Present and future conduct of sub
marintr yrnrl'are- was the 'principal
topic of a lively discussion this after­
noon.
Prof. Jesse S. Reeves, of the Uni­
versity of Michigan, criticized alleged
changes in the American position re­
garding armed merchantmen. Sever­
al administration officials, including
Assistant. Secretary of State Phillips,
and Solicitor General David were in
the audience.
Prevented by Law.
Prof. Raleigh C. Miner, of the Uni­
versity of Virginia, presented at.
length his conclusions that submar­
ines should be prevented by law from
Avarring
upon commerce.
Admitting "that submarines and
mines have a legitimate use in mod­
ern warfare, Prof. Amos S. Hershey,
of the Indiana university, said their
use should be mainly or substantially
for defensive purposes and be mainly
confined to belligerent waters, with
limited use on high seas.
Prof. 'Hershey and Everett P.
Wheeler of New York, an authority
on admiralty law, advocated forma­
tion of an international high court
after the war, to regulate use of the
submarines and mines.
Swept Aside.
Mr. Wheeler asserted that interna­
tional law had been largely swept
aside in the "war. "Its fabric," he
said, "is almost as ruined as the
great cathedral at Rheims. We want
something in the future more power­
ful than mere scraps of paper—an in­
ternational court with police power
capable of enforcing its decrees."
Prof. Reeves declared it was out­
side the possibility that an American
submarine would ever sink an enemy
ship like the Lusitania.
Prof. Carl F. Geiser of Oberlin uni­
versity, while declaring his support
of President Wiison in the controver­
sy with Germany, suggested that an­
cient international rules, restricting
submarines be extended.
"Can you expect' a \nation, fighting
for its very existence, to have the
submarine and not use it?" he asked.
He suggested classification of ves­
sels and cargoes and prohibiting wo­
men and children from travelling on
vems'/j carrying munitions.
REH WAR
Jamestown, iX. D., April 28.—Ar­
thur E. Claire of. this city is in re­
ceipt of a letter from his brother,
Herbert "somewhere in France," who
is attached to a motorcycle corps en­
gaged in dangerous work. Accom­
panying the letter is a picture of his
brother, whom he has not seen for 12
years and whom he says he would
scarcely recognize now. The letter
was 29 days in reaching here, being
24 days in getting to New York City.
Herbert writes interestingly of his
experiences, necessarily, however,
having to omit all nams of places
or other means of identification of
localities.

ing Situation.
CO-OPERATION WITH
MEXICO IS DESIRE
Washington, April 28.—One the eve
of the conference at Juarez between
Gen. Obregon and Gen. Scott and
Gen. Funston, representing the Unit­
ed States, it became known here to­
night that the American officers have
been instructed to attempt to work
out in detail military plans for the
co-opcration of the Mexican and
American troops in the dispersing.of
bandit bands, including a division of
Northern Mexico, into spheres of act­
ivity for the two forces.
Generally speaking, the aims of the
genrals, Scott and Funston, will he to
obtain the consent of Gen. Obrogon to
the employment, of American troops
in the territory immediately south of
the border, and to the organizations
of Mexican forces along definite lines,
in order that all of Northern Mexico
may be scoured thoroughly for Villa
and other outlaws.
Ask Co-operation.
He will lie told that the sooner Hie
Mexican troops give complete co-oper­
ation, the sooner tlio troops will ac­
complish this object.
The Mexican question including the
instructions to Generals Scott .and
Funston were gone over fully at to­
day's cabinet meeting, Jhe first' licMl
since it was determined to sond 'Gen.
Scott to the border to see Gen. Obre
«on.
Officials here have noted the state­
ment in border dispatches that Gen.
obregon would assert' that 14,000 Caf
ranza troops now were employed in
policing the territory south of the
border, thus insuring protection of
American border towns from Mexican
raiders.
It is generally understood, however,
that this will not be regarded as the
convincing demonstration desired by
the Washington government.
Funston to Act.
The presence of Gen. Funston at
the conference insures a full under­
standing by Gen. Obregon and Gen.
Scott of what has been accomplished
by the American exposition, and wlia!
further steps are contemplated. The
pursuit of Villa is going on according
to most' recent reports from the
American advance base.
All of these matters can be cleared
up at the conference by Gen. Funston
himself, if he deems it expedient.
Mexican advices generally were
meagre today, and reported no im­
portant changes in conditions in any
section.
TEDDY FAVORS
THEFAIR SEX
Killer of Wild Beasts Declares
Enfranchising of Women Has
Become National.
New York, April 28.—In a signed
statement prepared here tonight for
a committee of women, representing
the Congressional Union, who appeal­
ed to him as the head of the Progres­
sive party, former President Roose­
velt declared that the question of en­
franchising women has become na­
tional, and pledged his support of the
proposed amendment to the federal
constitution giving the vote to wo­
men.
Mr. Roosevelt's statements follow:
"I believe that the time has come
for a greater and truer nationalism in
this country. 1 believe in the nation­
alization of the issues, which affect,
not only men but women also.
"I therefore heartily endorse any
federal amendment, which shall sub­
stantially provide:
"(1) That the right of the citizens
of the United States to vote shall not
be denied or abridged by the United
States on account of sex.
"(2) Congress shall have power,
and it shall be the duty of congress
to appropriate legislation to enforce
the provisions of this article."

Columbus, N. M., April 28.—The
largest force of troops which has left
Columbus since the initial command
crossed the border six weeks ago, is
encamped tonight on the frontier, 15
miles west of here. The troops, con­
sisting .of more than a regiment of
cavalry, are preparing to cross the
line into Mexico at daybreak tomor­
row.
The soldiers left Columbus upon
orders of Gen. J. J. Pershing, expedi­
tionary commander, and it was stated
at military headquarters here tonight
that no reason had been outlined in
the order. Persons in constant touch
with the border situation offered var­
ious solutions, one belief expressed
being that Gen. Pershing feels thai
his shortened line of communication
from San Antonio to Columbus, a dis­
tance of 32.j miles, is in need of fur
llier strengthening.
Another was that the expeditionary
commander tears that one of the sti­
pulations of the conference between
Generals Scott and Obregon is that,
no more American troops shall cross
the border, and which will enable his
force to cope with any emergency.
Pursues Bandits.
Col. Cardena, at San Pedro, has re­
ported that Gen. Gomez pursued a
snialled band of outlaws in the hills
southeast of Laguna, killed the bandit,
leader, Fe/tniza, and six others, be­
sides dispersing the force. Reliable
information brought here, .places Villa
in or near Uxbiua xaneh u|, JUos- Mo­
ves.' The" commander at Escalon also
says small Villa bands are operating
in the region, while a report from
Sierra Moagda claims all is quiet
there.
Meets Mexican Consul.
Major Generals Hugh L. Scott and
Frederick Funston reached El Paso
shortly before six o'clock and immed­
iately held a conference with Andreas
Garcia, Mexican consul at El Paso,
to arrange for the date and place of
the first conference that is to deter­
mine the pending military questions
between Mexico and the United
States.
On the eve of the Obregon-Scott
Funston conference tomorrow, over
the disposition of United States
troops in Mexico, the feeling grew in
El Paso tonight that tentative Ameri­
can occupation of the parts of Chi­
huahua. pending eradication of Villa
bands by the de facto government,
would certainly result from the nego­
tiations.
From an authoritative source, it
was learned that the Mexican minis­
ter of war had signified his willing­
ness to meet Gen. Funston and Gen.
Scott "half way," in the coming con­
ference.
The opinion was general that if the
United States insisted on a continu­
ance of the new troops disposition
recently ordered by Gen. Funston,
the miitister of war could not well re­
fuse to grant the proposal, as to do
so would be to endanger the relations
between the United States and the
Mexican government.
Another (circumstance. influencing
speculation regarding the outcome of
the conference, was the confidence of
the Mexican officials that it would
reach a speedy conclusion.
"We do not expect any difficulties
in reaching an agreement," said one
of them. "The whole business should
be concluded in time for us to return
Monday."

well fixed financially, officials are un­
able to determine the cause of his
act.
Confesses to
the Murder of
Little Girl
Brute Almost Kills Ten Year Old
Child and Then Sets Fire to
House Where She Is Burned
to Death. I
Lansing, Kan., April 28.—Fred Bis
sell, a Topeka baker, confessed late
today that he murdered Edna Dins
more, a 10:year-old girl, in Topeka,
last Tuesday. Resentment caused by
the refusal of the child's mother *to
marry .him prompted the crime, many
of the details of"which were of a re­
volting character.
The story of the murder and hap­
penings that preceded it were told to
Warden Cooding, of the Kansas state
penitentiary, and, L. S. Kiene, sheriff
of Topeka, according'to an aunounce
men by Warden Cooding. After E'is
sell had overpoVered the child, he
left the vacant house where the crime
was committed, purchased smoking
tobacco and read a newspaper. He
then returned to his victim, but the
girl was not dead, and Bissell went
into an upper room of the building
and set the structure afire. From
a nearby corner, Bissell saw the
smoke curling from the roof. .He
saw the fire engines draw near. Then
he went back to his father's bakery.
The confession was obtained after
an all-day session.

IRELAND'S LORD LIEUT.
All Business Suspended as Result
of Trouble on "Shamrock
Isle."
Dublin, via London, April —Dub­
lin now has been held up for 21 hours
by a combination of members of the
iSinn-Fein society and followers of
James 'Larkin, head of the Transport
Workers' union, and well known as a
strike leader.
The lord lieutenant of Ireland, in
a proclamation today calls the move­
ment "insurrectionary." and declares
tha it is due to foreign prompting
It is, he said, "false," but adds that
"stern measures are being taken to
suppress it."
The trouble has completely dislo­
cated the life of Dublin. No shops
are open and no business is being
transacted. Street cars have ceased
to run, and the gas supply has been
cut off. Use of the telephones be­
tween the city and the suburbs has
been forbidden by the military and
the running of trains to and from
the country is very irregular.
Yesterday at midday, the Sinn-Fein
revolutionists were assembled as if
for one of their usual parades. They
were supposed to be going out for an
Easter Monday march. Ranks of the
file even imagined this was their pur­
pose. About 600 of them, however,
took possession of the general post
office in Sackville street. There the
*600 men remained until night and
still hold forth.
The raid was beyond the power of
the police to deal with. All of the
Lancers appeared on the scene, but
after two or three of the men had
been wounded they withdrew. Since
then the Sinn-Feiners in the posttffiee
have been left alone, and they have
hoisted the flag of the Irish Republic,
over the building.
The Countess Markivicz, the sister
of an Irish baron, in a volunteer uni­
form, was a prominent figure in tin
disturbance. She was one of the lead­
ing sympathizers with James Larkin
in the 1913 street car strike.
(During Monday, officers and men in
khaki and individuals were shot at
in the streets.
No evening newspapers appeared
in Dublin Monday anil no morning
papers were published Tuesday.

SUBMARINE SINKS
BRITISH CRAFT
No Americans Aboard So the Act
Was of No Diplomatic
Significance.
'Washington. April 28.—Ambassador
Gerard, in advising the state depart­
ment today that he had been invited
to confer wih Emperr William at
army headquarters, said he had not
been informed of the purpose of the
conference. The belief prevailed
here, however, that the Emperor de­
sires to discuss the general subma
rine situation with Ambassador Ger­
ard, and possibly explain in detail
his views for the benefit of President
Wilson.
Diplomats, especially those attach­
ed to German embassies, seemed to
regard the conference between the
ambassador and emperor as holding a
certain degree of hopefulness.
•Reconsideration was given the sub­
marine issue at today's cabinet meet­
ing—the first held in a week—but
Secretary Lansing was able to give
only the most meagre information on
the subject. In view of the activity
of German government officials and
heir apparent intention to reach a de­
cision as quickly as possible, the
president is disposed not to instruct
Ambassador Gerard to press for a re­
ply to the American demand at once.
The question will not be allowed to
drag along many more days, how­
ever, it was said today.
The attack by a submarine on the
liritisli merchantman, Industry, re­
ported today, and the placing of the
crew in open boats 121) miles from
shore, created an unfavorable impres
sion on officials,, although there were
no Anx-ricam iii board, and, ihere
fore, the United States is not directly
concerned. Germany has admitted
that it. is only proper to place 'pas
scngers and crews of attacked ves
sels in open boats when they are near
shore and the weather is good.
Optimism regarding the ultimate
outcome of the situation was appar
en in German circles following the
receipt, by the German embassy of
dispatches from Berlin described as
indicating that Germany would at­
tempt to meet the American demands.

Discussion was precipitated when
Senator Sutherland, a republican
member of the committee, read to the
senate an interview published yester­
day, quoting Senator Ashurst as
charging that republican members of
the judiciary ctmmittee were fili­
bustering in order to delay a vote on
the nomination until after the nation­
al political convention.
Senator Ashurst stood steadfastly
by the quoted statement, during the
heated argument that, followed, unil
ussured by fellow democrats tn the
committee that there was no such
lilibuser. lie withdrew the charge at
the suggestion of Senator iBrandegee,
after he had announced executive ses­
sions and had charged the republi­
cans were angered over the nomina­
tion of Mr. lVrandeis, as he was a
chirtTipuju of .the ltiasaes.
Tonight it was generally (believed
that he debate would serve to bring
the committee to a vote on the nom­
ination within a few days. All the
senators who took part in the discus­
sion were members of the committee.
Government Ordnance Experts
Give Testimony in Conspiracy
Trial.
New York, April 28.—The operation
of the mechanism of the time bomb
alleged to have been invented by
Lieutenant Robert Fay, for the pur­
pose of destroying at sea of ammuni­
tion ships at this port was illustrated
by the federal ordnance experts in
federal court oday a Fay's rial and
his alleged co-conspirators', waiter
Scholtz and Paul Daeche.
According to the expert, James E.
Moore, in charge of the guns at Ft.
Wadsworth, the Fay bomb was "in­
geniously wicked." He testified that
he had tested the contrivance with
explosives and found that it works
perfectly.
Immediately after the demonstra­
tion of the workings of the bomb, a
case containing 50 sticks of dynamite
was brought into the room for iden­
tification by Louis G. Fuchs of But­
ler, N. J., as some of the explosives
purchased by other members of the
alleged conspiracy for use in the dead­
ly instruments. Fuchs failed to iden­
tify the explosives, and he case was
hurriedly but carefully taken from the
court room, much to the relief of the
jury and spectators.

London, April 28.—The situation hi
Dublin, where the Sinn society un­
dertook a raid against the govern­
ment last Monday, continues serious,
according to latest' advices. The po­
lice, according to belated reports,
were unable to cope with the raid­
ers, and the Sinn-Feiners not only
•seized the general postofflce, but bar­
ricaded themselves in Sackville street
and dug trenches in St. 'Stephen's
green.
"The military operations for the
suppression of the rebellion in Di^iUn
are proceeding satisfactorily," says a
communication issued by Field Mar­
shal French, commanding the' hoi^e
forces, late last night.
"What may be described as the or­

communication adds, 'are confined to
a few localities, the principal ones be­
ing the Sackville street district, in
which the rebel headquarters appear
to be the general postofflco."

Admiral von Tirpitz, as minister of
the nacy, already are at tne Emper­
or's headquarters.
Aerial Artillery.
Only aerial artillery activities
marked the progress of the war on
the European field, but the British
have met with reverses, both in
Egypt and Mesopotamia.
In a battle near Quatia, according
to reports from Constantinople, a
British force of four cavalry squad­
rons has been annihilated by the
Turks, who captured 300 prisoners
besides many guns.
Russian dispatches say that an at­
tempt to relieve the beleaguered
force in Kut-El-Amara failed when a
vessel grounded in the North Tigris
river. The affair the official state­
ment says, was carried out with the
"utmost gallantry."
Airmen Active.
Airmen, also have been active in
the Asiatic field. Constantinople
claims that a British aero-squadron
raided Kutara, after the British de­
feat and threw bombs on a hospital.
The Turks attacked from an aero­
plane an Entente warship at Kantara,
and the docks of Port Said. They
also dropped bombs on Entente avia­
tion guards on Imbros island.
There has been some infantry act­
ivity along the front in France, held
by the British forces. The artillery
bombardment has been violent, both
east and west of the flense, in the
Verdun region. East 6f the Meuse,
the Germans shelled the French posi­
tions between the Cote du Poivre and
Douaumont.
F«rench airmen have shelled Ger­
man stations and the Germans have
retaliated by attacks on (he Verdun
section. German aeroplanes have
dropped bombs on the Russian battle­
ship Slava in the Gulf of "Riga, and
Berlin reports the action had food re­
sults.
