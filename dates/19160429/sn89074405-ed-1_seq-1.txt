LATER DERAILS LACKING.
London, April 21^—Altboagh the
story of the early hoars of the Dub
lin uprising has. now been disclos
ed in ooiunderable detail, England
still is without authentic Informa
.tlon its. to the progress of later
events. Normal telegraph, tele
phone, and mail services with Ire*
land'have not been restored and
the existing means of communica
tion, is subject to such a strict cen
soreMp that It' Is possible to obtain
only fragmentary Information. So
far aa olReiial reports show, the sit
uation In Dublin is generally being
brought under control. It la report
ed that.the casualty list already ex
ceeds 100.
There seems to be no doubt that
the rebels still control various parts
of Dublin and that street fighting
continues with Increased casualties.
Of the situation outside of Dub
lin little Is known beyond the offi
cial admission that dissatisfaction
baa spread to various localities In
the west and south of Ireland. So
far as revealed by the Information
which passed censorship, these dis
turbance* have not been attended
by heavy lighting.
Details of Uprising.
Dublin, Tuesday, April 26 (by mall
to London,, theme dlasemanated by
telegraph—Dublin- how has been held
up for twenty-four hours by a com
bination of members of the Sinn Fein
society and followers of James Lark
tn, head of the transport workers'
union and well known as a strike
leader.
There has been the. same violence in'
the city as marked the big street ear
strike in 1913, which was headed by
Larkln, but supplemented by the use
of an, armed force with military pre
tensions and the seisure of the
strategic points designed 'to give the
disturbance the aspect-of a revolu
tion.
The lord lieutenant of Ireland, In a
proclamation today, calls the move
ment "insurrectionary" and declares,
that it is due to foreign prompting. It
Is, he says, "small," but adds that
''st^rri. measures are being taken to
suppress' It'.''
No Shops Open.'
The trouble has completely dislocat
ed th^ life of Dublin. No. shops are
open and no business is being trans,
acted. Street cars have ..ceased to run
and the gaa: supply'has been out oft
Use of tfie telephone between the city
and the fuburba has been forbidden

Begin Digging Trenches.
In St. Stephens' green, a detach
ment of the Sinn Feiners entered the
green, which is surrounded by a high
railing, and locked themselves in and
began digging trenches.
The Countess Markievies, the sister
of an Irish baron In a. volunteer uni
form was a prominent figure in the
disturbance. She was one of the lead
ing sympathisers with James Larkln
in the 1913 street car strike and her
house was raided in January by the
police who are said to have seised a
printing press and type with alleged
pro-German literature which was be
ing printed. Her husband is said to
be a Polish nobleman.
In addition to St. Stephens' green,
various corner points covering the en
trance to the green also were occupied
by the Sinn Feiners who flourished
rifles from the windows of nearby
houses. Several passing motor cars
and taxicabs were commandeered.
The occupants of these machines were
taken inside the green, apparently as
hostages and the ears were drawn up
along the roadbay as barricades.
There has been much rifle and revol
ver firing, seemingly at nothing in
particular and several persons out
holiday-making have been killed or
injured. The wounded were removed
to St. Vincents hospital on one side of
St. Stephens' green.
In the Portobello road, over the
canal which forms the boundary of
the city, the Sinn Feiners seised a cor
ner public house. Here also holiday
makers suffered from promiscuous
shooting. One platoon of the royal
Irish rifles succeeded in dislodging
and taking prisoners thfse Sinn Fein
ers.

Shot in the Streets.
During Monday officers and men In
khaki and also Isolated individuals
were shot at in the streets. Some of
them are reported to have been killed
or wounded.
No evening newspapers appeared In
Dublin Monday, and no morning pa
pers were published today (Tuesday)
The livening Mall office was occu
pied by. members of the Sinn Fein
yesterday. The military have estab
lished themselves opposite the Bven
ing Mail office.
The Royal College of Burgeons,
which faces St Stephens green on the
west, was seised by the Sinn Feiners
and their flag flown from it.
The authorities express the opinion
that the trouble may last a day or two.

First Detailed Aoeount.
London. April 29.— The Associated
Press, dispatch sent from Dublin Tues
day afternoon was the first detailed
eye-witness a'ecount of the disorders
in Dublin to be received in London.
The resident Associated Press corre
spondent In Dublin forwarded the
message by courier to Kingston, seven
miles southeast of Dublin, whence it
came to London by mall. The mes
sage bore the stamp of the postal cen
sor and apparently was unexpurgated.
The Dublin View of the uprising at
the end of the first day seemingly cor
roborated the report that the force
which began the disorder was not a
large one.

Prevent Assault.
London, April 29.—Major
General Townsend, comman
der of the British forces be
sieged at Kut-El-Amara,
Mesopotamia, by the Turk

ber, has surrendered. This
information is contained in
the British official statement
issued this afternoon.
The official statement ad
ded that General Townsend
destroyed all his guns and
munitions before surrender
ing.
General Totynsend prob
ably was driven to surrender
to avoid the starvation of his
forces.
A recent official Turkish
communication said that the
position of the British was
critical, and that they were
expecting to receive small
supplies of food by aero
plane.
An official statement from
London last night, showed
that the last effort to send
supplies to the garrison had
failed.

Stormy. Debate Ov?r Nomination
Washington, April -29.—A stormy
debate over th« nomination of Louis
D- Brandeis for the supreme court
broke in the senate late yesterday and
before it was over predictions were
mad« by two members of the Judiciary
committee, ode. of them a democrat,
that an unfavorable report on the ap
pointment would follow when the
committee reached a vote.
Discussion was precipitated when
Senator Sutherland, a republican
member Of the'committee, read to the
senate an interview published quot
ing Senator -Ashurst aa charging that
rspubllcan members of the Judiciary
committee were filibustering in order
to delay a vote on the nomination un
til after the national political con*
ventions.
Senator Aahurst atopd steadfastly
by the quoted statement during the
heated argument that, followed until
assured-, by fellow democrats on the
committee that there was no such fili
buster. He withdrew the 'charge at
the suggestion of Senator Brandegee
after he had., denounced executive
sessions and charged that the repub
licans were angered over the nomina
tion of Mr. Brandeis ^because he waa
a champion of the masses.
Last ntght it generally-was believed
that the debate would serve to bring
the committee to a vote on the nomi
nation within a few days. All the
senators rwho took part In the discus
sion were members of the commit
tee.
Senator Sutherland took Senator
Aahurst to task both for revealing to
newspaper men what had taken place
yesterday in the Judiciary committee,
and for .saying that tha republican
members were filibustering. Mr. As­

hurst responded that he was not like
some public men who would shift re
sponsibility for what they said to
newspaper men to the correspond
ents, but that he had not said any
thing about what had transpired in
the committee room.
"Newspaper men did ask me if I
thought the republican members were
filibustering against the confirmation,
and I said I did," declared the Ariz
ona senator. "I said it and I would
like to see the color of the hair of
the man who can imprison my
thoughts."
"I can well imagine the consterna
tion of republican senators when the
nomination of Mr. Brandeis came to
this senate," continued Senator As
hurst. "Had he been a man who
spent his life in steering corporations
around the law, they would have been
fighting for his confirmation but hav
ing spent his life in fighting for the
poor people of the land casuistry is
resorted to."
He added that the desperation of
republicans was shown by the fact
that they now see reaching out to
take a man off the supreme court and
to drag him into the mire of politics
in an endottvor to defeat Woodrow
Wilson for the presidency.
"Does the senator know." asked
Senator Cummins, "that three-fourths
of the time spent in consideration of
the Brandeis .nomination has been
consumed by democratic members of
the committee? If there is any fili
buster it has been a democratic fili
buster. The republican members of
the Judiciary committee have been
