| "LONDON, April 29.?Although the
gsstory of the early hours of tho Dub
|lln}upri8lng lias been disclosed now fn
[v:considerable detail, England is still
without authentic information as to
J,thefiprogress of later events. Normal
^telegraph, telephone and mail services
| with Ireland have not boon restored
| and existing means of communication
are subject to such strict censorship
Ithat'it is possible to obtain only frag
pmjBtttary information. Such news dis
^patches as came through this morning:
facl'ded little to the information con-!
Itained in last night's official advices
;|ahd stories of eyewitnesses.
So far as official reports show, the
^.situation in Dublin is gradually being
J; ' brought under control. Tho most im?
[ i mportant news that the rebels have
\ been driven out of St. Stephen's
.Green with bombs, sustaining heavy
Jvlosses in killed, wounded and prison
F/fers' have not been confirmed officially.
| There seems to be no doubt however,
"' that the rebels still control various
t parts of Dublin and that street fight
: ;ing continues with lengthening lists
of.5''casualties. It is reported the cas
ualty list already exceeds 100.
Igftbl tho situation outside of Dublin
plittje is known beyond the official ad
^mission that the dissatisfaction lias
kspread to various localities in tho
^ west and south of Ireland.
Ilij- Field Marshal French's statement, of
jplast; night describes the disturbances
if asjlocal in clioracter. and so far as has
[ been revealed by information which ?
KhaV;passed the censorship, they have
Mnot'*been attended by heavy fighting.'
? j DUBLIN', April 27. 2 a. m.?Fifteen
hundred or so armed men of tho Sinn
p^eiir had a hod on Ireland's capital
|today. Alter four days of lighting their
Irebel flag still flew from a number of
I'central points.
? - Since Monday some of the chief pos-1
Jptions in the city have been in the ]
hands of the rebels. In defending
j Ihe strongholds against regular
: troops and Irish nationalist volun
teers. tho rebels are fighting with des
peration for their lives, which they
know may be forfeited on account of
" treason. Regulars now command all
rebel positions, the fall of which is
t merely u question of time.
$t'. When the Associated Press cor
r: respondent landed early this morning
at the quay near the customs house,
the. singing of bullets from refles of
snipers in the vicinity was frequent.
Augustine Birrell, the Secretary for
Ireland, had made the passage from j
England with the newspapermen. As I
he* stepped ashore lie shouted cheer
i: ily: "I wish you luck, gentlemen. I
don't know what will happen to you
;vnow that you are here."
j!". , Soldiers and- rebels fired at. each
SpiOtHer, from street corners, wharves,
& roofs and windows. Sentrys with bay-'
onet8 on loaded rifles stationed overyl
-. few yards shouted their commands to!
:halt
Naval guns joined in and added to
|tho deafening gunfire. From the quay
the; respective positions could bo seen.
. Strangers who traversed some parts
^ofv tho central portion of the city
Jtook .their lives in their hands. In

" .voxnen and children.

WAR'S WORST BLOW TO GREAT
Attempts to Get Relief Army to Besieged Town Frustrated
By the Activity of the Turks?Surrender
Surprise to the Public.
(By Associated Tress.)
LONDON, April 29?Major General Charles Town
shend, commander of the British forces besieged at Kufc
el-Amara, Mesopotamia, by Turkish forces since lastifDea
i ofmber has surrendered.
j This information was contained in a British official]
'statement issued this afternoon.
This disaster, which is the severest blow which the Brit
jisli have sustained since the war began, probabjjf wasJpreS
| cipitated by the failure of the movement to get supplies|
110 the beleaguered force.
Dispatches received last night announced that a relie:
I ship with supplies for the garrison grounded in the Tigris!
I river four miles east of Kut.
1 When it was shut up in Kut-el-Amara the foi'ce *w]uc
surrendered consisted of about 10,000 men, well equipped
An attempt was made to get a relief column to it, buranfS
Turks made the progress of this expedition so slow thai
for a time it looked as if the Russians coming down-froi~
the north would arrive before it did. At last reporjesft
Russians were'90 miles from Kut-el-Amara.
So far as the public knew there was not the slightest!
doubt of the ability of the British to hold out until'relief
of some sort arrived. General Townshend's action indi
cates that the condition of the force must have been^deSf
perate for a long time.
