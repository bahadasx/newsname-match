WITH COUNTER PLAN WHO MEET REPULSE OUTING TO PATRONS
Chief of Staff Will Answer Re
quest to Retire With Offer of
Proteotion.
REPORTS "PLEASANT CALL"
All Conferences to BeHeld In
Juarez, as Asked by Mexican
War Minister.
Obrogon's demand that American
troops ba withdrawn from Melco will bo
met fcy a counter proposal from den
eral Bcott In the conference today at
Juares.
The counter plan li understood to be
for the United State forces to hold
their ground In northern Mexico as a
sort of protectorate -while tho do facto
troopi complete the work of stamping
out Villa's bands.
Genera) Bcott reported this after
noon he made "a vary pleasant call"
upon General Objegon at Jiiares Jast
night, and that Obrcgwn would re
turn the visit at El Paso today.
Secretary Maker had no confirma
tion of the reported jsjosslnR by Vll
llstas at Presidio, Tex. nor was ho
advised of tho masting of American
troops at Columbus for further re
enforcement of Americun communi
cation linen
The State Department was advised
today that General Obregon hasg ex
pressed a desire to have all the con
ferences at Juuiex. This will be
done.
May Move Northward.
Bcott Is authorized to propose that
American troops move northward In
Mexico while the Mexicans pursue Villa
and his bands to the south.
Ho is instructed, however, not to treat
on withdrawal, but to Inform Obregon.
should he mako such a demand, that
this must be taken up through diplo
matic channels.
Scott's orders deal with co-operation.
He Is Instructed to emphasise the need
for It, both for Its effect upon the
Mexican people and for tho sake of
early capture of Villa,
Ha haa ben told to Dolnt out to Gen-
iral' Obregon that public opinion in
the United States will not brook repe-
-tltlon of .the Columbus raid, and that
for this reason It Is Imperative' the
Villa hunt continue.
., ' Must Prevent Outrage.
The American Government does not
care wnetner tne American troops
capture Villa or whether" this honor
falls to the Carranzlstas. This point
will be made to show Obregon that
the desire of tho Administration la
solely to so scatter the Villa bands
that there cannot be further border
outrage.
Obregon Is vested with diplomatic
as well as military power. Scott, on
the other hand, is authorlezd only to
urge the need for concerted action.
He cannot make any bargain about
tke length of stay of the expedition,
further than to show Obregon that It
can be shortened If there Is actual
co-operation.
Will Ask Withdrawal.
That Obregon will make either a
suggestion or a demand for with
drawal Is believed here. A report of
Scott's progress is expected by late
tonight, though there may be several
days of parley. Officials here place
.especial trust In Scott and believe
that If It Is humanly possible to
swing Obregon to the American view
point, Scott will do It.

their properties by fear of bandit at

While the visit of Ambassador

Bplrlt on the part of Emperor William.
Admluatratlon officials refuse to accept
It as evidence that Germany Is pre

The State Department has madn It

which It Is iald Berlin might make,
will be rejected. This was that Ger

national law gives merchantmen the
right to arm and to uso arms for de

When Americans take passago on

BERLIN, April 29. Publication of

of the old charge that the United States
Is doing everything to help England.

From Revolutionists Artil

LONDON, April 29. A rebel
force, variously estimated at from
2,000 to 10,000, has been cornered
aid surrounded in the heart of Dub
lin by British troops.
The government forces have laid
siege to-the general postofflce build
ing in which the rebels have estab

Several nearby buildings have
been captured from the Sinn Fei
ncrs. 4
Press dispatches from Dublin to
day say that more than 100 persons
already have been killed in the
str.eet fighting.
Light artillery has been trained
upon the postoffice, but the British
commanders hope to capture the
rebel headquarters without doing
further damage to the building it
self. OVERTURES MADE.
A press iKcpatch frorn a town near
I'ablln today reported that somo of
the rebel bands have made overtureor
surrender. , .
Severe fighting occurred In .Wi Irth
capital late yesterday afternoon when
llritlsh troopi attacked and captured
the strongly entrenched positions ui the
rebels In Stephen's Green.
The green Itself Is enclosed iy a
wall.
Entrance Is gained only through
comparatively narrow gates. acro
which the Sinn Felncra had built high
barricades of overturned auto-busca
and trucks.
Government troops rushed the barri
cades in a massed attack and aftr fif
teen minutes of furious hand-to-hind
fighting broke through the gate.
Insldo tho green the rebels had
thrown up shallow trenches, protected
by sandbass. From behind the
they poured fusillade Into tho British,
troops nttacitlng the gate.
Despite this hot fire, the government
forces charged the rebel works without
waiting for re-enforcements.
Charge Rebel Worka.
One detachment of Sinn Felnera was
cut off and surrounded. The prisoners
numbered more than 300.
An unofficial dispatch toddy said the
entire green is In possession of govern
ment forces.
Several women Sinn Felnera who Hg
ured In teh early street fighting, have
disappeared and are believed to have
been hidden away by rebl sympathizers
who feared they would be executed.
The authorities have been Informed
that the Countess Marklevicx. sister ot
an Irish baron and wife of & polish
nobleman, appeared In a green uniform
and marched with the Sinn Felnera on
the day the revolt began.
According to the best information ob
tainable here today, the rebels still hold
the general postofflce, a large biscuit
factory near Dublin castle, and the Four
Courts, an area situated between tho
castle and the Royal Dublin barracks.
Fires are still burning In several parts
of tho city.
At Klllarney, Gorey, Clonmel, and In
certain sections of County Galway dis
turbances have ocurred, but other por
tions of Ireland remain calm, It was
officially stated.
Agitators Arrested
Sinn Fein agents who attempted to
start outbreaks In Cork and other
Irish cities were promptly arrested.
A forco of troops left England yes
terday morning for Ireland and It la
believed Gen. Sir John Maxwell will
be able to control the situation with
out further reinforcements.
The best accounts of th'e outbreak
of tile rebellion wero brought hero by
the first boat-load of passengers ar
riving from Ireland, via Holy Head!
These stories agreed that the trouble
started at the atroke of noon Monday,
when a force of nearly 1,000 rebels,
wearing soft hats and with a mar
velous collection of rifles, some mod
