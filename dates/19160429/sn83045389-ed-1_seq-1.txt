added:
"Newspapermen did ask me if i
thought the Republican member* were
filibustering against the confirmation,
and I said I did. i said it. and I would
like to see the color of the hair of the

"I am not one of those Senators who
pretend to deliberate after their minds

Ashurst. "I can well imagine the con
sternation of Republican Senators when
the nomination of Mr. nraudcis came
to this Senate, if he had been a man
who spent his life in steering corpora
tions around the law, they would have
been fighting for his confirmation; but,
having spent his lire in fighting for
the poor people of the land, casuistry
is resorted to."

Senator Works, of California, another
Republican member of the committee,
also criticized Senator Ashurst for his
reflections on I he Republican member--*,
and drew another repl.x from the
Arizona Senator, who .viid: "L'ntil yon

"The Democratn have caused delay,"
said Hoke Smith, the Georgia. Senator.
"There has never been a lime when

Hons. The American representatives
who came to El Paso this evening
were noncommunlcallve. and opinion
regnrding the outcome of the delibera
tions was bsserl on the attitude of Car
ranza officials.
1 rom an authoritative source it was
learucil that the Mexican Minister of
,,ar is willing to meet General Fun
ston and Scott "half-way" iM the com
ing negotiations. This is taken to
mean that General Obregon would con
sent to American troops remaining in '
Mexico, providing the actual chase 'of
\ ilia .s forces was relinquish nl entirely
to the Carran7.a troops, and that on
receipt of assurances from the do facto
government that the bandit groups had
hceii wiped out the Americans Fhould
ictire immediately.

The opinion was general that.. If the
United States conferees insisted upon
a continuance of the. troop movements
recently ordered by General Funston
and now being carried into effect, the
Minister of War could nut well refuse
Jo grant the proposal, as to do so would
be to endanger the relations between
I American and Mexican go\ern
men t s.
It ?as rumored that General Obregon
"'d 1,ep" Klvrn full power to reach a
decision ... behalf of bis government,
but tins could not be verified.
Reports from the American expedi
tions front in Mexico this afternoon
?cio that large forces of Carranza
