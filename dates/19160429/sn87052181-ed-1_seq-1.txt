Washington. Ambassador von
Bernstorft has been caught In a trap
from which ho cannot escape If Wash
ington's Interpretation of tho last few
days' developments bo correct. Wash
ington has come to tho conclusion
that tho German embassy faces tho
necessity of admitting Improper ac
tivities or having tho fact proved
against It. Whether Count von Bern-
Btorft can show Washington Is wrong
remains to bo seen.
Papers taken from the offices of
Wolfo von Igel, former secretary of
Capt. von Papen, and himself accred
ited to tho embassy, form the prin
cipal basis of this belief. The con
fession of Horst von der Goltz, tho
alleged spy recently returned by tho
courts from London, and a copy of
which Is In possession of tho authori
ties, forms another Important ele
ment. Tho documents seized In von
Igel's office constitute a mass of tes
timony, which If acknowledeged as
official will result in the ambassador's
immedlato dismissal, and if denied
might result In a prosecution for con
spiracy. ,
Can't Give In.
Berlin. Germany can go no further
in hor submarine concessions to tho

"A situation has arisen in the for

it is my plain duty to Inform you very

"It will be recalled that In Febru

ment announced its intention to treat
tho waters surrounding Great Britain
and Ireland ns embraced within tho
seat of war, and destroy all merchant
ships owned by its enemies that might
bo found within any part of that por
tion of t.lio high seas, and that it
warned all vessels, of neutral as well
as of belligerent ownership, to keep
out of tho waters It had thus pre
scribed, or elso enter them at their
peril.
"The government of tho United
States earnestly protested. It took

Bases Protest on Natural Rights.
"It based Its protest on tho ground
that persons of neutral nationality
and vessels of neutral ownership would
be exposed to extreme and intolerable
risks, and that no right to close any
part of tho high seas against their use
or expose them to such risks could
lawfully bo asserted by any belliger
ent government. TJie Jaw of nations in
thoso mattersupW which tho govern
ment of tho United States based Its
protest, Is not of recent origin or
founded upon morely arbitrary prin
ciples set up by convention.
"It Is based, on tho contrary, upon
manifest and imptratlvo principles of
humanity, and has long been estab
lished with tho approvnl and by tho
express assent of all civilized nations.
"Notwithstanding tho earnest pro
test of our government, tho imperial
German government at once proceed
ed to carry out the policy It had an
nounced. "It expressed tho hope that tho dan
gers Involved, at any rate tho dangers
to neutral vessels, would bo reduced
to a minimum by the Instructions
which It had Issued to Its submarlno
commanders, and assured the govern
ment of the United States that It
would take every possible precaution
both to respect the rights of neutrals
and to safeguard the lives of noncom
batants. "What has actually happened In the
year which has since elapsed has
shown that thoso hopes wero not Jus
tified, these assurances Insusceptlblo
of being fulfilled. In pursuance of
tho policy of submarine warfare
against tho commorce of Its adver
saries thus announced and entered
upon by the Imperial German govern
ment In despite of tho solemn protest
of this government, the commanders
of German undersea vessels havo at
tacked merchant ships with greater
and greater activity, not only upon tho
high seas surrounding Great Britain
and Ireland, but wherever they could
encounter tiem, In a way that has
grown more and moro ruthless, more
and more Indiscriminate as the months
have gone by, less and less observant
of restraints of any kind; and havo
delivered their attacks without com
punction against vessels of every na
tionality nnd bound upon every Eort of
errand.
Neutral Vessels Destroyed.
"Vessels of neutral ownership, even
vessels of neutral ownership bound
from neutral port to neutral port, havo
been destroyed along with vessels of
bolllgerent ownership in constantly in
creasing numbers. Sometimes tho
merchantman attacked has been
warned nnd summoned to surrender
before being fired upon or torpedoed;
sometimes passengers or crews have
been vouchsafed the poor security of
being allowed to take to the ship's
boats before she was ent to tho bot
tom. "But again nnd again no warning
has been given, no escape even to the
ship's boats allowed to those on board.
What this government foresaw must
happen has happened. Tragedy has
followed tragedy on tho seas In Buch
fashion, with such attendant circum
stances, as to make It grossly evident
that warfaro of such a sort. If warfare
It be, cannot be carried on without tho
most palpablo violation of tho dictates
allko of right and humanity. What
ever tho disposition and intention of
tho Imperial German government, It
has manifestly proved Impossible for It
to keep such methods of attack upon
tho commerco of its enemies within
tho bounds set by either tho reason or
tho heart of mankind.
"In Fonruary of tho present year tho
Imperial German government Informed
this government nnd the other neutral
governments of the world, that it had
reason to bellovo that the government
of Great Britain had armed all mer
chant vessels of Brltlch ownership and
had given thorn secret orders to attack
any submarlno of tho enomy they
might encounter upon the seas nnd
that tho Imperial Gcrmnn government
felt Justified In tho circumstances In
treating all armed merchantmen of
bolllgerent ownership ns auxiliary hos
tels of war, which it would havo tho
right to dsstroy without warning.
"Tho law of nations has long recog
nized the right of merchantmen to
carry arms for protection, to uso them
to repel attack though to uso them in
such circumstances at their own risk;
but tho Imperial German government
claimed the right to set these under
standings aslilo In circumstances
which It deemed extraordinary. Even
tho terms In uhlch it announced its
puiposu Ihus still furthor to relax tho
restraints It had previously professed

vessels which were not armed would
still be exempt from destruction with
out warning nnd that personal safety
would be accorded their passengers
and crews; but even that limitation
If It was ever practicable to observo
It, has In fnct constituted no check at
nil upon tho destruction of thips of
every sort
"Again and again tho Imperial Ger
man government has alven this gov
ernment Its solemn assurances that at
least passenger ships would not be
thus dealt with, nnd yet it has again
and again permitted Its undersea com
manders to disregard '.hose assurancos
with entiro lmunlty. Great llnera like
the Lusl'anla and the Arabic nnd mero
ferry boata llko the Sussex havo been
attacked without a moment's warning,
sometimes before they had even be
come aware that they were In the pres
ence of nn armed vessel of the enomy
and tho lives of noncombnnant pas-
songcrs and crow havo been sacrificed
wholesale In a manner which tho fov
ernmrnt of tho United Stales cannot
but regard as wunton and without tho
slightest color of Justification. No
limit of any kind has In fact been set
to the Indiscriminate pursuit and de
struction of merchantmen of nil kinds
and nationalities within tho waters,
constantly extending In area, whero
these operations havo boon carried on;
and tho roll of Americans who havo
lost their lives on ships thus attacked
and destroyed has grow-i month by
month until tho ominous toll has
mounted Into th j hundreds.
L'. S, Government Has Been Patient.
"Recent events make the conclusion
Inevitable that It is only one instance,
even 'hough it be one of tho most ex
treme end distressing instances, of
tho spirit and method of warfaro
which tho Imperial German govern
ment has mistakenly adopted, and
vhlch from tho first exposed I hat gov
ernment to tho reproach of thrust.ng
all neutral rights aside In pursuit of
Its Immediate objects.
"The government - of the United
States has been very patient. At every
stage of this distressing experlenco of
tragedy after trasedy. In which Its
own citizens weio Involved, it bus
Bought to be restrained from any ex
treme course of action or of protest by
a thoughtful consideration of tho ex
traordinary circumstances of this un
precedented war, and actuated In all
that is said or did by the Bontlments
of genuine friendship, which the peo
ple of the United States have always
entertained, and continue to entertain,
towards the German nation. It has,
of course, accepted tho successlvo ex
planations and assurances of the Im
perial German government, as given In
entire sincerity and good faith, nnd
has hoped, oven against hope, that it
would provo to be possible for tho Ger
man government so to order and con
trol the acts of its naval commanders
as to squaro its policy with the princi
ples of humanity as embodied In tho
luws of nations. It has been willing to
wait until tho significance of tho acts
became absolutely unmistakably nnd
susceptlblo of but ono Interpretation.
"That point has now unhappily been
roached. The facts aro susceptible of
but ono Interpretation. Tho imperial
German government has been unablo
to put any limits or restraints upon Its
warfaro against olther freight or pas
senger ships. It has therefore become
painfully evident that tho position
which this government took nt the
very outset Is Inevitable, namely, that
the use of tho submarines for the de
struction of an enemy's comorce Is of
necessity becauso of the very charac
ter of tho vessels employed and tho
very mothod of attack which their em
ployment of course Involves, Incom
patible with the principles of humanity
tho long established and Incontroverti
ble rights of neutrals and the sacred
Immunities of noncombatants.
"I havo deemed It my duty there
fore, to say to tho Imperial German
government that If It Is still It purpose
to prosecute relentless and Indiscrim
inate warfare against vessels of com-'
merco by tho uso of submarines, not
withstanding tho now demonstrated
Impossibility of conducting that war
faro in nccordnnco with what tho gov
ernment of the United States must
consider tho Bacred nnd Indlsputablo
rules of international law and tho unl
lersally recognized dictates of hu
manity, tho government of tbo United
States Is at lost forced to the con
clusion that there Is but ono course
It can pursue; nnd that unless tho Im
perial government should now imme
diately declaro and effect nn abandon
ment of its present methods of war
faro against passenger and freight ves
sels, this government can havo no
choice but to sever diplomatic rela
tions with the government of the Ger
man cmplro altogether.
"I have tuken It, and taken It in tho
confidence that It will meet with your
approval and hupport. All sober
minded men must unite In hoping that
tho Imperial German government,
which has In other circumstance.
stood as tho champion of all that wo
aro now contending for In tho Interest
of humanity, may recognlzo tho Jus
tice of our dnmands and meet them In

NEW TROLLEY LINES
Tho Coal Distilling Plant May
Mean Better Transporta

BIG SYNDICATES INTERESTED
Abundant Gas for Cheap Electricity
Will be Furnished by Proposed
Refining Plant.
Tho location of n plant-in Central
Missouri to 'distill canncl coal may'
bo tho means of providing transporta
tion facilities for that part of tho stato,
which so lone has faced that problem.
It became known recently that sev
eral syndicates have plans under con
sideration to construct electric lines
into tho coal fields. Announcement
by tho American Coal Refining Com
pany of plan3 to construct a distilling
plant which would produce commer
cial gas, solved a lot of questions, ana
It was said that chances of an agree
ment between tho refining company
and rail men aro not remote.
Tho distilling plant, which Is to
havo an Initial dally capacity of one
thousand tons of coal, will produce
about G million cubic feet of gas, ac
cording to W. J. Stevenson .treasurer
of tho company. Ho stated that with
tho plant so distant from commercial
centers, the company did not find ade
quate market for tho gas output ex
cept by piping It to surrounding towns,
Ho admitted that tho electric lines
Ilkoly would not extend further than
between trunk steam lines, most of
which traverse tho state east and wesi
through tho coal fields. But such
lines would provldo means of trans
portation for localities that now aro
mlle3 from any railroad.
It is said that tho McKinley syndi
cate is interested In developing tho
section, but Mr. Stevenson would not
confirm tho report. Tho Missouri
Pacific and Rock Island have lines in
parts of tho field, whllo the Frisco
touches tho south sido. Tho Missouri
Pacific has branches from its Kansas
City-St. Louis line to Warsaw and Ver
sailles, which aro in the midst of tho
field. Whether officials of that line
had been considering converting tho
branch lines for electricity Mr. Steven
son would not say.
Dovclopmcnt has been slow In cer
tain sections of tho stato under which
tho largest beds of cannel coal Ho,
Without rail lines, tho refining com
pany would not have transportation
for Its products. But with electric
lines to which tho gas could bo sold,
furnishing cheap electric current, tho
coal country would be accessible.

FIND DYES IN CANNEL COAL
New Company Announces Its Inteiv
tlon to Build a Refining Plant
In Central Missouri.
Announcement was mado recently
by tho American Coal Refining Com
pany, of which C. V. Fisher, a Kansas
City grain dealer, Is president, that
tho firm would build a coal distilling
plant in Central Missouri.
Tho plan ls-to mako the canncl coal
there, so long considered of little valuo
begin to yield coal tar products, some
of which aro dyes, crudo benzol, by
products of which aro used in making;
explosives, in tho treatment of raw
leather and in solidifying motor car
tires; and illuminating gas of tho high
est known commercial grade.
Turposo to Invest approximately
$300,000 in the new plant was told by
W. J, Stevenson, treasurer of the com
pany, recently on his return from tho
concern's Initial venture In tho distilla
tion of coal at tho Denver plant. Mr.
Stevenson, with Charles O. Hoover,
who patented' tho process, has Just fin
ished n. test of tho Missouri coal. Ho
declared its products wore much larg
er than even those of tho lignite coal
in Colorado.
Tho site of tho Missouri plant will
not be mado public until nn Investiga
tion into freight rates and shipping fa
