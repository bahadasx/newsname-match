Wliile certain moneyed inttf
iereati bi I certain political in
teresti are endeavoring to. draw
the United states into conflict with
peoples of other nations, and
while the president of this coun
try is being be§et by those who
desire mi iniinense armament for
this country, the following mas
terly words might well be con
sidered. They are by the Hon.
L. J. Roundtree of Texas, presi
dent of the national editorial as
sociation :
Nations thai have lived by the
sword have perished by the sword.
Men who have gained wealth and
glory as desperadoes and robbers
have all met death Commen
surate with their crimes, Nineveh,
Babylon. Rome, Memphis, Sodom
and Gomorrah perished because
they defied God's immutable law
and lived by the sword and in the
cesspools of human depravity.
Through all the ages men on horse
back, with the sword, have gained
temporary victories; builded pass
ing empires and have marked
their alleged successes with human
blood and have attempted to glor
ify and perpetuate their memories.
Kings, rulers, emperors, czars,
tyrants, and other murderers have
stolen nations and impoverished
people. Feasts have been spread
and the king and a thousand of
his lords have gathered to make
merry and canonize the alleged
victor. Peoples have been plun
dered and robbed and taken into
slavery to satisfy the insatiate
greed and avarice of the wicked.
Crowns and scepters have been at
stake —they have been won and
lost and kingdoms torn down and
destroyed. On a fateful night in
July. 1914, all Europe went to bed
drunken. For many years a crisis
had been coming and now: "To
Anns!" Millions of troops were
on the march in a few hours.
Preparedness had been the cry
and now war was the inevitable
result. The European war was on
before men and women had sober
ed from the previous day and
night's debauch. From the
crowned heads to the serfs there
was drink suitable for all pur
poses. For years before the great
conflagration there had been a
ceaseless disturbance and out of
the maelstrom would be heard:
"We can whip the world." The
European nations had been taught
in their cafes, gardens, theaters,
schools, and churches that all
other nations were their enemies
and must perish or their kingdom
would be finished. It was a Bel-
Bhazzar feast every night. Bui
no European nation believed the
"Medea and Persians" were com
ing to them—they themselves
were to be the victors. The kings
and rulers of Europe had degen
erated into imbeciles, venal and
corrupt or conceited and bigoted
and degenerate criminals, and
should have long ago forfeited the
respect of every man claiming to
be civilized. The men with the
sword, on horseback, assembled at
Gibraltar, at Buckingham, at Pots
dam, at Versailles, at Constanti
nople, and throughout Europe.
The curse of militarism, the dark
est day in civilization, and de
struction of nations was at hand.
Each degenerate nation believed
the day had come and it was to
be God at Armageddon. But
these rulers had forgotten that,
no nation ever survived by the
sword even though it was built
by the sword.
Every ruler in Europe believed
he was a Xapoleon and could win
the victory and make Europe one
grand empire. lie believed he
knew when to strike. No ruler
was satisfied with his own king
dom and forgot the fate of Alex
ander the Great and Napoleon
Bonaparte. They saw their mil
lions of women and children and
ignorant men as serfs and slaves
to pay tribute to the false rule
of degenerate tyrants. The king
doms were too small and the
bloodthirsty aristocracy must have
more subjects atid territory ai
least this was the purpose of the
mobilization which came like a
chip of thunder out of a clear sky.
Mlood and murder was everywhere
to be seen. Was there any prin
ciple involved 1 Not that any per
son heard of. They forgol the re
treat of Napoleon from Moscow
and the defeat of the tyrant on the
field of Waterloo. Every kintr
ami ruler in Europe classed him
self a world conquerer and has
been guilty of the useless murder
of his subjects. It is a pity that
men that brought on the war
were noi required to do the fight
ing until the last of their race
perished on the battlefield. It is
a pity thai any ruler can escape
the terrible penalties of war with
his life. Hut it is now war to the
bitter end—and not peace.
In his last days on the dismal
shores of St. Helena it is said that
Napoleon was asked. "Who was
tin' greatest warrior of the
world?" Without a moment's
hesitation the soldier replied.
"Jesus Christ !" When it was

final sepulcher at St. Helena.
There were no more contests for
the greatest warrior of the world.
Biul he frankly faced the situation
in Hie hour of death and spoke of
the greatest peace advocate this

In the United States today there
is growing up a spirit of militar
ism that may prove a curse. They
have set aside God's command
ments "Thou shall not kill." Put
that commandment is as eternal
as the "Rock of Ages." When

TALKS ON BANKING.
(By courteßy of the American Bank
ers Association, Savings Flank Dcpt.)
HOW TO DRAW A CHECK.
The first thing a depositor in a
bank should learn is how to draw
a cheek, for if a check is improp
erly drawn it may lead to con
fusion and might bring a loss to
the bank and annoyance to the
depositor. In the first place the
figures should be plainly made, so
that no question can arise as to
the amount. If the figure is care
lessly made, so that it confuses
those who handle the check, num
berless hours of work may follow.
For Instance, If a bank receives a
check for $1.88 with a poor "8,"
and a clerk lists it as $1.08, it may
take many hours' time to find the
difference, and the entire day's
work may have to be done over.
The rule should be: Never mnke
a figure that may be mistaken and
never pass one that is in doubt—
coiTeet it by crossing out the bad
ami making a good one alongside.
Second, the words and figures
should agree. The law says that
it the (wo are different, the writ
ten words govern, but make both
carefully and gel them alike.
Third. Begin the writing well
to the left of the writing space
and fill in the unused space with
a wavy line. Begin the figures
well up against the $ sign and
make the character 00-00 after,
but close up against the figures.
Use a good black ink and write
firmly, so that plenty of ink gets
into the fibre of the paper.
Fourth. Always write your
Dame exactly as you wrote it on
the bank's signature card, "Mrs.
William Smith" may be the same
person as "Mary V. Smith," but
the bank account; doesn't stand
that way.
Adopt one signature an<l slick
to it. I><> not flourish, nor make
,i fancy signature. Handwriting
experts will tell you that a plain,
distinctive signature, with no fur
belows, is the most difficult to
forge.
The law of forgery is that the
bank is bound to know your Big
nature,and pays a forged instru
ment at its peril. The risk is all
theirs, but that is not to say you
should not help eliminate the
chance of forgery by taking care
that your checks are properly
drawn, ff you are grossly negli
gent you might have to stand the
loss yourself. Better be safe than
sorry. There are numerous pro
tecting devices on the market,
some better than others and these
may be used as added safeguards;
but there is no rule of law that
compels you to do so. You are
safe if you follow the above sug
gestions, but safer if you use a
proteetng device, for then you
cannot be charged with any negli
gence in making your checks for
gery proof. Do not make it easy
to work a fraud through your ac
count. Do not give checks to
strangers. Do not leave your
check book lying around. Do not
leave a signed check where it may
be filled in and Wtfd. Your bank
er will bless you if you follow the
foregoing suggestions.
