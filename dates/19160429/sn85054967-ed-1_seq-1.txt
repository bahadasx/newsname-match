of Chambersville, and John Ben
nett, of Blairsville, former mem- |
bers of the board of county com

population were increadfed to sl,-
800. Indiana county comes un
der the provisions of the act and

Adrian Miners
Back to Work
Ali Locala Have Now Receiv
ed Officiai Notice of
the New Scale.
The miners employed in the
Adrian operation of the R. & P.
Coal and Iron Company returned
to ,work yesterday. Three of
the mines of this company that
have been idle for several days
have now resumed operation and
it is expected that the differ
ences existing at the other
plants will sjiortly be adjusted.
Vice President Charles O'Neil
of the United Mine Workers, dis
trict No. 2, states that every
miners' locai in the centrai Penn
sylvania field has received the
officiai endorsement of the re
cently signed scale agreement.
Scale Meets With Approvai
"I have heard from a number
of districts," said Mr. O'neil,
"and it sems to meet with gen
eral apporval.
"In March, instructions were
given the rnen to continue at
work until Aprii 20 at least. In
some localities, we understand,
the men have discontinued
work."
"Was it the idea that they
should cease their labors Aprii
20?" Mr. O'Neil was asked.
"Here and there," said Mr. O'-
Neil, "miners are out because of
locai conditions, but the great
majority of men are at work and
will continue at work. The
March notice instructed them to
remain at their posts until or
dered out by the union heads.
Needless to say, we have not or
dered them out. I expect to see
the recently signed agreemnt
ratified by a large vote, as let
ters received by the locals con
tained our endorsement of the
agreement."

THE PA TRIOT
their terms.
The auditors in turn surcharg
ed them for the amount on the
ground that an act to increase
the salaries of constitutional
officers in power. The commis
sioners and their legai advisors
declare that the office of poor
director is not a constitutional
office, but an elective one, and
that they are therefore entitled
to the increase. The mater will
be appealed to the locai court
for decision in the near future.
A similar condition presented
itself four years ago when a
board of commissioners, of
which the present commission
er, J. M. Marshall, was a mem
ber, was surcharged for overpay
in salary.
The case was appealed to
Judge S. J. Telford, who allowed
the increase on the grounds that
poor director is not a constitu
tional office.

PROBE ROBINDALE
DISASTER, MAY 9
Coroner H. B. Buterbaugh, of
Indiana county, has selected
May 9 as the date for the in
quest into the disaster which
caused the death of eight men in
the Robindale mine of the Cone
maugh Smokeless Coal Co. The
inquest will be held at Indiana,
the coroner announced.
Mine inspectors, mine officials,
miners and others connected
with the Robindale disaster will
testify at the hearing. The
case is attracting the attention
of mining men from ali pars of
the country.
Almost a month ago the ex
plosion occurred in the Robin
dale mine. Eight men lost their
: lives. Seven bodies were re
moved some hours after the dis
aster. The mine fìlled up with
water and it was found impos
sible to recover the eighth body,
that of Thomas Hoover.
After more than a score of
days the water was drained
from the mine and the dismem
bered body of the workman re
covered Friday evening.
Mining men have advanced
the theory that gas was ignited
by the use of open lamps by the
miners.
