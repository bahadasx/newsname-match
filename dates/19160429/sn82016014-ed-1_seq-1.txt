ExeinsiTe Details (Jiven to Re
porter After Confession.
The State Journal hereby prints an ex
clusive story of the Bissell confession and
the details leading up to this dramatic
climax of the murder of Edna Dinsmore in I
Topeka Tuesday. This newspaper has
kept reporters constantly on the scene and
with the prisoner ever since and even be- 1
fore his arxest in Topeka the day of the i
outrage. Ernest Tucker of the State
Journal was the only newspaper represen
tative with Bissell in the famous flight from
Lawrence and during the lurid confession
yesterday. His story appears below as
well as other stories written around the in
cident appearing in other columns of the
State Journal this evening.
BY ERM.sr TUCKER.
Fred Bissell violated and mur
dered Edna Dinsmore for re
venge. He did it to see Bessie
Dinsmore. the mother, shed
tears and to hear her screams.
Bissell set fire to the house in
six different places when he
knew the little girl he had torn
and choked and bruised was still
alive.
Bissell denies that he subject
ed Edna Dinsmore to any fur
ther torture after he left the va
cant house the first time, but
with the knowledge of the arch
criminal gained from two days'
pumping, the officers believe
that he deliberately went back
to the house, found the poor, bat
tered little body still warm and
again violated it.
He did not make these admis
sions in his confession. He
made them to Sheriff Kiene,
Robert Miler, Judge Lindsey and
the writer after the confession
had been made and signed
when Bissell had relaxed from
the strain and was talking and
acting naturally.
Sir at Bessie.'
"Why did you commit the crime?"
wan asked.
"Well. I hardly know." said Bissell
calmly. "I was feeling mighty sore
at Bessie that morning. I though she
hadn't treated me right. I had got
her her job and done lots of things for
her yet she had hurt my pride."
"Did vou have anything of the kind
in mind when you left the store with
the little girl?"
To Buy School Books.
" N'i I didn't. Edna and 1 were
walking along Monroe street and I
was thinking about Bessie. Edna said
her mot her had refused to get her
sonie sehool books she wanted. I said
to myself: 'Here's where I get even
with Bessie.' To Edna I said : 4 You
come along with me and we'll -et
those books' She went willingly."
How They Got In th House.
" How did you get her into the va
cant house?" was asked.
Ota, that was easy." said Bissell.
"When we got to the house I told her
Jack Somebody' had some old books
a. d that he was moving out. She
walked rinht in with me."

WILL DIE
IN 'PEN'?
"We Ain't Tellin' How, but
We'll Get Him!" Prisoners Say.
Criminals Too Proud to Have
Murderer in Their Midst.
TALK TO STATE JOURNAL MAN
"He's Not One of Us," the Con
victs Openly Declare!
Warden Says He'll Make Every
Effort to Protect Him.
It is common talk around the state
penitentiary, not only among the pris
oners, but among guards as well, that
Bissell will not live to be sentenced for
the atrocity he committed in Topeka.
No guard is going to kill him and they
will use due diligence to protect him
from the prisoners but he cannot be
protected in the seclusion of the of
ficial residence indefinitely. The time
must come when he will go into a cell
and take up his task like other pris
oners. 'T wouldn't give a nickel for that
fellow's chance if they put him out
here," said a Topeka convict out in
the prison yard last night. "He
wouldn't last longer than a snowball
in ."
"How would they get him ?" was
asked.
"I ain't tellin' how they'd get him
but they'll get him." was the laconic
reply.
Never in the history of the Kansas
penitentiary officials say, has there
been as much feeling against a fellow
prisoner as there is against Bissell.
Classes in Prison.
"Most of these fellows know they
are criminals," said Warden Codding,
"but they know they are too good to
associate with a fellow like this. There
are classes in prison just as there are
outside, but there is no class into
which this man fits."
Bissell has not been inside the
prison walls to date. He has been
kept in the big building used as a
residence by Warden Codding and in
which the offices are located. He is
handcuffed and shackled. He is
guarded constantly. He is moved from
room to room. Warden Codding ad
mitted last night that this method of
handling Bissell could not be kept up
indefinitely. He admittd he had a
serious problem on his hands.
When He Goes to Work.
"Eventually," said another officer.
"Bissell i3 going to have to go to
work and take his chances. Of course
we will try to protect him."
The writer walked through the
twine plant the morning after Bissell
was taken to the prison. He did not
know any of the prisoners working
there but during the trip through six
different convicts stepped up and
asked some question about Bissell.
Thej- knew what his crime was and
they knew he had been brought to the
penitentiary just ahead of a mob.
Their sentiments were with the mob.
A Man With Daughters.
"Let them put him out here in the
twine plant," declared one old prison
er, who. it developed later, is the fath
er of four daughters, "and see what
will happen to him."
"Why didn't you let the mob hang
the ?' asked another convict.
"This is no place for him over here.
He's not one of us."
Bissell is known all through the
prison. He has the record of a de
generate there, although it is not
down In black and white. Half a
dozen prisoners who knew him when
he was at T a firing last told of his
lewd and degenerate conduct. Some
of the things told coincided with in
formation the Bertillon man already
had. Known as "Dirty Face."
At the prison Bissell ws known as
"Dirty Face." He served time under
the name of Frank Davis. No one in
the penitentiary knew him as Fred
Bissell yet there was talk among the
convicts before Bissell was definitely
connected up with the crime that it
looked like the work of "Dirty Face."
Prisoners and officials at the state
penitentiary will be surprised if Bis
sell lives any great length of time
after he is required to take up his
daily task and sro to and fro in the
prison yard.

GARRISON AT
KUT-EL-AMARA
SURRENDERED
After 146 Days, British Soldiers
Are Starred Out.
Force Comprises 9,000 English
and Indian Troops.
PLIGHT A MILITARY BLUNDER
Destroys All Munitions Before
Giving Up Fort.
Turks, Floods and Hunger
Overcome Besieged Men.
London, April 29. The British
garrison at Kut-El-Amara, 1 05 miles
southeast of Bagdad, has surrendered
to the Turks, it was officialy an
nounced tod ay. The forces surren
dering' were composed of 2,970 British
and 6,000 Indian troops, the war of
fice announced.
General Townshend had been be
sieged for 146 days when he surren
dered. No attempt was made today by offi
cials to minimize the seriousness of
Townshend's position. The official
statement last night that an unsuc
cessful effort had been made to run
a food ship to the Tigris through the
Turks line indiciated the situation at
Kut-El-Amara was desperate. Floods
had completely blocked all progress
of the relief forces now held near
Felahle, 23 miles east of Kut-El-Amara.
General Townshend's forces were
trapped by the Turks 105 miles south
east of Bagdad early last December
after the collapse of the British cam
paign again Bagdad.
Penned Up Last December.
Pushing1 northward from the Per
sian gulf region, the British under Sir
John Nixon occupied Kut-El-Amara
on September 29, 1915, and then ad
vanced rapidly to Dialat, within ten
miles of Bagdad. They were beaten
back by a large force of Turks on De
cember 26, 1915, and in their retreat
on Kut sustained aaotaer crushing de
feat through the desertion of Arabian
volunteers who turned traitor and
joined the Turks.
General Nixon left Townshend with
a force estimated by the Turks at
10,000 men to attack Kut-El-Amara.
which occupies a position at the bend
of the Tigrus on high ground.
General Nixon did not want to sur
render Kut-El-Amara to the Turks
because the position, if strongly forti
fied by the Turks, would bar another
British advance on Bagdad.
Fail at Bagdad.
Sir John Nixon was subsequently re
lieved of the command of the Meso-
potamia forces because of the Bag
hdad blunder, being succeeded by Sir
I Percy Lake. British troops reinforced
; by veterans from the Dardanelles,
then began a march to relieve the he
! sieged garrison. Floods, however, in
terfered with the progress of the re
lief forces and they have been halted
for several weeks more than 20 miles
I from K ut.
General Townshend's force kept in
communication with the troops at
tempting to relieve them by aeroplane
' and wireless. Aeroplanes carried
j food in condensed form to the besieg
j ed garrison and in a desperate attempt
to rush supplies to Townshend the
British ran a ship up the river under
; the Turkish fire. The ship, however,
ran aground four miles from Kut, ac
cording to an official statement gi-en
out at London last night,
j General Townshend destroyed all of
the garrison's euns and munitions be

Amid Roaring Flames Troops

BATTLE MOST PICTURESQUE
Figures of Men Outlined Against

Military Apparently Now in
Full Control of Situation.
Dublin. April 29. Amid roaring
flames that threatened to sweep this
city of more than half a million in
habitants, British troops and Sinn
Fein rebels engaged in furious hand to
hand struggles until an early hour yes
terday. The rebels, routed by the govern
ment troops, scurried away as dawn
broke upon the blackened ruins of
Sinn Fein strongholds in the heart of
Dublin. In their flight they were
mowed down by Maxims, and rifle fire
and lost heavily. It is now estimated
that more than 100 persons were kill
ed or are missing as a result of the
four days of street fighting.
Military tn Control.
The military apparently are now in
control of the situation though the dis
orders are not yet completely quelled.
A ring has been thrown around the
rebel forces who seem to be disheart
ened by their failure to arouse a gen
eral uprising throughout Ireland.
Last Thursday night the troops be
gan closing in. the rebels starting nu
merous fires in the heart of the city.
They evidently planned to start a
great conflagration, hoping to escape
in the resulting confusion.
Troops were rushed into the burning
portions of the city with instructions
to extinguish the flames and kill all
Sinn Feins who opposed their work.
They had scarcely begun work when
they were subjected to fusillades from
the rebels on top of buildings.
Eclipsed War Front Battle.
There followed a battle that for
picturesque features eclipsed anything
seen on the European war fronts.
Blasts of smoke and flame hid the
buildings in the hands of Sinn Feiners
from sight, rolling away a moment
lat to disclose group? of rr.fn stand
ing bolt upright on the roofs, firing
down on the goernment noops below.
Picked Off Soldiers.
It was reckless work. The figures
of the Sinn Feiners. outlined against
the background of darkness by the
leaping tongues of flames, made them
easy targets. One after another the
rebels were picked off by government
troopers firing from the shadows of
the streets.
The general postoffice. headquarters
of the rebels, and the customs house
escaped unharmed by the flames,
which stopped just short of these
principal structures.
The work of clearing out the snip
ers is proceeding systematically, the
British troops taking care to avoid all
possible danger to public property or
injury to noncombatants.

Prosecuted For
Defaming Name
Of Washington
Tacoma, April 29. Paul R.
Haffer was placed on trial in the
superior court today charged with
maliciously defaming the memory
of George Washington. In deny
ing a motion by the defense to
dismiss the case. Judge E. M.
Card opened the way for submis
sion to the Jury of questions said
by attorneys to be unique.
Haffer was arrested on com
plaint of Col. Albert E. Joab, an
attorney, after the publication in
a newspaper of a letter signed by
Haffer in which Washington was
referred to as "a slave owner and
an invet-iate drinker.' Haffer
stated that it was intended for an
argument against hero worship.
In asking for a dismissal of the
case Haffer's attorneys said that
if it went to the jury it would set
a precedent which would mean
that anyone who ventured an hon
est opinion of the dead celebrity
would e liable to arrest.
The prosecution bases its case
on a state statute which makes a
criminal offense of publication
of matter exposing to scorn or
ridicule the memory of a deceased
person.

and mixed wall plaster instead of

with his clover seed when he seed

was seeded he discovered his mis
take and asked the experts at the
Oregon Agricultural college what
lie should do.
"We would advise that you now

the answer.

NEWSIES' GREAT WORK
Wide Awake Topeka Roys Sold 20.OOO
State Journals.
Enterprising newsboys sold more
than 20.000 State Journals in Topeka
on Tuesday, Wednesday. Thursday
and Friday of this week. It is saf to
say that nearly all of these papers
wit" sold within a radius of six blocks
of the State Journal office. Eighth
and Kansas avenues.
By the way. did you ever note the
real metropolitan manner of selling
newspapers In Topeka. pursued by the
State Journal newsies?
The Topeka youths ha v f hose in
Kansas City backed clear off the
boards. In Kansas City they merely
stand on the street corners and shout.
"Star. "Post" and "Journal."
But here in Topeka they've got a
quick eye for new. First it was:
"State Journal. Read all about mur
der of little girl."
The next day:
"State Journal. Read all about
Bissell. Girl's mother accuses Bis
sell." On Thursday:
"State Journal. Read about mob Bt
state prison.
On Friday every one of the editions
contained a new feature on the case.
"Souther on Way to Lan'sing;
"Souther Identifies Bissell;" "Bissell is
Weakening;" and finally, "Bissell Con
fesses.
The State Journal issues five or
more editions every day. There is no
money in an extra edition, but when
the news Is of sufficient Importance
; the State Journal quickly issues an
edition and the public is supplied with
same through the excellent work of
the newsboys.
As a reward for their great hustling
: this week, the State Journal took
I all the newsies to the Topeka-St.

worked just as hard for the Savages
