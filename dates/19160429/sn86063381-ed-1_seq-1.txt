Large Force of Troops.
Columbus, N April 29.The
largest force of troops which have
left Coluumbus since the initial com
mand crossed the border six weeks
ago, encamped last night on the fron
tier 15 miles west of here. The troops,
consisting of more than a regiment
ot cavalry, are preparing to cross the
line into Mexico.
The soldiers left Columbus upon
orders of General Pershing expedi
tionary commander, and it was stated
at military headquarters here today
that no reason had ben outlined in
the order Persons in constant touch
with the border situation offered vari
ous solutions, one belief expressed be
ing that General Pershing feels that
his shortened line of communication
which extends from Columbus to San
Antonio, a distance of about 325 miles
is in need of further strengthening.
Another was that the expeditionary
commander fears that one of the
stipulations in the conference be
tween Generals Scott, Funston and
Obregon may cross the boundary, and
is anticipating such an agreement by
bringing his command to a strength
that will enable it to cope with any
emergency.
UNDER AGE BOYS
CANNOT TOTE GUNS
The bleat is often heard of citizens
who affirm that their lives are in dan
ger from boy gun toters. Protection
is afforded them by the statutes of
the state and if they are not enforced
it is their own fault because they do
not go before the proper officials and
sign a complaint.
S. C. Bailey, game warden, today
stated that several reports had come
to him in regard to boys carrying
guns and that wild ducks and geese
had been killed by the boys.
The law which prohibits under-age
boys from carrying guns is as fol
lows
"Use of firearms by MinorsNo
minor under the age of fourteen
years shall handle or have in his pos
session or under his control, except
when accompanied by or under the
immediate charge of his parent or
guardian, any firearm of any kind for
hunting or target practice. Violating
any of the foregoing provisions, or
aiding or knowingly permitting any
such minor to violate the same, shall
be guilty of a misdemeanor

TRIED FOR CRIMINALLY
LIBELING WASHINGTON
Tacoma, Wash., April 29.
Charged with criminally li
beling George Washington,
Paul R. Haffer, socialist,
went to trial today. In a
newspaper letter he alleged
Washington drank and swore.
Colonel A. E. Joab, local at
torney, filed the complaint,
saying that as Washington
was the "father of his coun-
try," all Americans were his
children and any of them had
a right to demand redress for
insults directed at their na
tional parent.
Defense Counsel Pendleton
replied that if this were logic
al reasoning, Adam was the
father of all men, and anyone
could start criminal proceed
ings if some person maligned
Adam.
The court said Adam had
no standing in law and order
ed Haffer held.

PUNCH NUMBERS AID
POLICE IN SOLVING
ROBBERY MYSTERIES
Small Piece of Paper With Numbers
Ends Robbery Career of
Boy.
ARCHIE WINTERSTEIN TO
BE TAKEN TO RED WING
Chief Ripple Does Efficient Work
Much of Stolen Loot is
Recovered.
31788093.
These numbers proved the undoing
of Archie Winterstein, the 16-year-
old robber, and aided to solve the nu
merous small robbery mysteries
which have occurred in Bemidji dur
ing the past few weeks.
These numbers were on a small
piece of paper from a punch board.
The paper was found in the I. P.
Batchelder store in a glass on the
morning after that store had been
broken into and considerable small
articles, old coins and pennies taken.
Watches Young Boy.
Chief of Police Ripple, when
given this paper with these numbers
immediately began a search of the
city for the punch board from which
this punch was taken. He located
the board at Harry Gunsalus' soft
drink parlor and found out that a
glass of pennies had been taken from
the parlor The punch had been
placed in the same glass as the pen
nies. The glass was the same that
was found at the I. Batchelder
store and as the robbery was com
mitted at both places the same night,
Chief Ripple deducted that the same
person committed the two robberies.
He found that Winterstein was work
ing in a barber shop next door to the
Gunsalus drink parlor and began
watching him.
Friday morning after the Hakkerup
Studio had been broken into and
about six dollars taken, Chief Ripple
arrested Winterstein. Winterstein
confessed to the robberies but de
nied having the loot. Chief Ripple
went to the home of the boy's par
ents and in a trunk belonging to the
boy found many articles that had
been stolen, in the city for some time
past. The trunk was filled with
cards, cap pistols, toy pistols, whis
tles, chips, paper money, pennies,
search lights, toy banks, tobacco, etc
Winterstein is only 16 years old
and is out on parole from the Red
Wing training school. He was sent
there previously on a charge of break
ing into boat houses. After serving
about ten months he was paroled on
account of good behavior and has
been reporting regularly to that in
stitution.
Not a Criminal.
He isn't a criminal at heart, how
ever. He is a kleptomaniac. He
can't help from stealing. He doesn't
do it for the loot as may be seen by
the kind of articles that he takes.
He just steals for the "love of steal-
ing." He would get up at four
o'clock in the morning, slip out of
the home of his parents, go down
town, break into a store and return
home rejoicing over the "trick" that
he had turned. He liked the excite
ment of the work.
Among the places he broke into
were Barker's Drug store, Tropp
man's, Gunsalus, Hakkerup's (twice),
the home of W. H. Newton and the
high school manual training room.
He will be returned to Red Wing.
Authorities from that institution are
expected to arrive in the city this
afternoon.
Much credit is due Chief Ripple
for the way he solved the robbery
mysteries. The solving of the case is
just another example of the efficiency
of the Bemidji police department.
An unusual theme has been adapt
ed for screen presentation in the Mu
tual Masterpicture, DeLuxe Edition,
"The Love Liar," featuring Crane
Wilbur, at the Rex theater today. The
story tells of the affaires de coeur of
a prominent musician who lightly
casts aside genuine love for false love,
resulting in his own downfall.

INDIAN LAND
CASE DECIDED
Decision of Lower Court Affirmed in
White Earth Indian Reser
vation Case.
The state supreme court yesterday
affirmed the decision of the lower
court in the Luck Land company, re
spondent vs C. J. Minor, et al., de
fendants, F. A Dickson, appellant.
Judge M. A. Spooner of Bemidji
represented the Luck Land company
in the case.
The decision is as follows:
In issuing a patent to land in fee
simple to a mixed blood Chippewa
Indian of the White Earth Indian
reservation, the officials of the United
States necessarily determined that
the Indian was an adult. Such de
termination is conclusive as to the
Indian's right to take and hold title
except in a direct action to set aside
the patent.
The issuance of the patent, while
an adjudication of the patentee's
right thereto, and of his title to the
land, does not prevent the courts of
this state from inquiring into the
question of the Indian's age for the
purpose of determining the validity
of a conveyance from him.
Under the Federal statutes after a
patent in fee is issued to an Indian
questions as to the validity of his
subsequent transfers of the land are
controlled by the laws of the state.

SENATOR TO BOOST
AMENDMENT NO. 1
Senator William A. Campbell of
Minneapolis is a business visitor in
Bemidji today. He stated today that
he will deliver 32 addresses in Min
neapolis during the next few months

No. 1. Senator Campbell is very
much in favor of the amendment and
believes that if the people are made
known with the importance of the

large vote.

TODAY'S NORTHWEST ODDITY
St. Paul, Minn., April 29.
Beef has become dear meat
and Minnesota officials would
meet the situation with deer
meat. W. T. Cox, state for
ester, would have Minnesota
farmers raise deer to "bust"
the beef trust. He cited that
fences are about all that is
necessary to raise deer for
venison. They are self-sup
porting, grazing on even the
poorest land. They mature
in half the time steers re
quire, he says.
WEDDING MARCHES
DROWN CANNON
Five Large Weddings to Take Place
Today Miss Elliott and Miss
DuPont to Wed.
(By Dan Cupid.)
Loveland, State of Bliss, April 29.
This is the first day for a long time
that I haven't been deafened by the
roar of those European battles. I've
been planning for months to get
enough organs booming wedding
narches to drown the cannon and
today they're doing it.
I sort of concentrated on today
and I think I shot up about 20,000
gross of quivers on it. I didn't score
that many hearts for today, but you
must understand that with the cost
of living so high, the average heart
has grown very flinty.
I think I did pretty well, though,
considering.
Miss Eilliott, Miss DuPont, Miss
Wood, Miss Walling and Miss Baker
are the day's choicest trophies,
though there are many others quite
as charming and sweet, if not so well
known, of course.
Now about the weddings today:
Edith January Elliott, daughter of
President Howard Elliott of the New
Haven railroad, weds Edmund Pen
dleton Rogers of New York, at Bos
ton.
Ellen Coleman DuPont, daughter of
T. Coleman DuPont, the munition
king, weds Hollyday Stone Meeds of
Wilmington, Del., at Wilmington.
Elizabeth Brower Wood, daughter
of Henry A. Wise Wood, noted in
ventor, weds John Cyrus Distler of
Baltimore, at her home in New York.

British Kutelmara has surren

surrendering consisted of 2,970
British and 6,000 Indians. The
town has been besieged for 140
days. This is the first instance
in the present war and one of the
few instances of any war where
a British garrison besieged has
been forced to surrender. At
temps to rush supplies to the
forces failed.
Dublin, Ireland, April 29.One
hundred persons have been killed or

Officials admit the difficulty of get

Women and children are partici

Sein Fein agents attempting to

The rebel force is variously esti
mated at from two to ten thousand.
It is cornered in the heart of Dublin
by British troops. Government troops
have laid siege to the general post
office. Several nearby buildings have
been captured Light artillery has
been trained on the postoffice. The
British hope to capture it, however,
undamaged. An unconfirmed re
port says that some of the rebel bands
have made overtures to surrender.
The severest fighting was when the
British captured Stephen's Green.
Note Causes Flurry.
Berlin, April 29.The publication
of President Wilson's memorandum of
the American attitude toward armed
merchantmen has caused a new flurry.
It has not been commented on offi
cially. The average Berliner used
the note to substantiate the charge
that President Wilson is trying to
help England. Wilson's statement is
that a merchantmen is a peaceful
trading ship until conclusive evidence
to the contrary is cited. One Ber
liner says: "If I walk down the'
street with a gun in my pocket, how
does President Wilson know my in
tentions as to offensive or defen-
sive?"
