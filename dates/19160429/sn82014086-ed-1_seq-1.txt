REVOLT IN DUBLIN
IS ON LARGE SCALE,
No Shops Open and No Business Transacted for Up
wards of Twenty-four Hours
NO NEWSPAPERS NOR
Insurrectionists Are Composed of Members of the Sinn Fein
Society and Followers of James Larkin, Widely Known
as a Strike Leader Disturbance Started Monday When
Sinn Fein Members Had Assembled Ostensibly for Pa
rade Motor Cars and Taxicabs Were Commandeered
and Their Occupants Held as Hostages Impossible to
Approximate the Number of Persons Killed or Injured,
as Crowds Were Out and the Shooting Was Wild and
Reckless This is the First
Details of the Uprising, and
When the Revolt Was Still
Dublin, Tuesday, April 25, 3 p. m.,
via London, April 28, 10:15 a. m.
rublin has now been held up for
twenty-four hours by a combination
of members of the Sinn Fein Society
and followers of James Larkin, head
of the transport workers union, and
widely known ar a strike leader.
Has Aspeat of a Revolution.
There has been the same violence in
the city as marked the big street car
strike in 1313, which was headed by
IjErkin, but supplemented by the use
ot an armed force with military pre
tensions and the seizure of strategic
points designed to give the disturb
ance the aspect of a revolution.
Lord Lieutenant Issues Proclamation.
The lord lieutenant of Ireland in a
proclamation today calls the move
ment insurrectionary" and declares
that it is lue to foreign promptings.
It is, he snvs. "small". He adds that
"stern measures are being taken to
suppress it."
Situation is Serious.
The revolution thus far is considered
an imitation, though on a much ex
tended scale, of "Fort Chabrol" in
Paris, which w as held by political riot
ers some fifteen years ago and the
riots in Sydney Street in London.
While it is declared not to have the
support of the people generally and
even is not considered a rising by
some of the authorities, the situation
certainly is very serious and far be
yond the dimensions of a riot.
No Business Being Transacted.
The trouble has gone on now for
twenty-four hours and has complete
ly dislocated the life of Dublin. No
shops are open and no business is be
ing transacted. Street cars have ceased
to run and the pas supply has been
tut off. Use of the telephone between
the city and the suburbs has been for-
biden by the military and the run
ning of trains to and from the coun
try is very irregular.
Assembled as if for Parade.
Yesterday (Monday) at mid-day the
Sinn Fein revolutionists were as
sembled as if for one of their usual
parades. They were supposed to be
going out for an Easter Monday
march. Some of the rank and file
even imagined that this was' their
purpose.
Took Possession of Postoffice.
About 600 of them, however, took
possession of the general postofflce in
Sackville Street, which at the time
was attended by a usual small holaday
staff of clerks. There the six hun
dred men remained all day and night
and still hold forth.
Telegraphic and postal communica
tion in so far as it goes through this,
the chief postofflce in Ireland, has
ceased.
Beyond Power of Police.
The raid was beyond the power of
the police to dr?al with. Small de
tachments of lancers appeared on the
scene but after two or three of their
horses bad beon shot and two - or
three of the men wounded they with
drew. Since then the Sinn Feiners in
the postofflce have been left alone and
they have ho'Eted the flag of the Irish
republic over the building.
Barricades of Barbed Wire.
Various corners in Sackville Street
have been occupied by the Sinn Fein
ers and barricades of barbed wire
erected in the thoroughfare. In the
street tnere has been a great deal of
lootinr of shops and smashing of win
dows. Began Digging Trenches.
A detachment of the Sinn Feiners
entered the St. Stephen's Green, which
Is surrounded by a high railing, lock
ed themselves in and began digging
trenches. The authorities considered
that this move as a last stand might
be intelligible but as an outset of the
disturbance they could not guess its
purpose.
Countess Prominent in Disturbance.
The Countess Marivicz, the sister
of an Irish baron, in a volunteer uni
form, was a prominent figure in the
disturbance. She was one of the lead
ing sympathizers with James Larkin
in the 1913 street car riots and her
house was raided in January by the
police who are said to have shed a
printing press and type with which
alleged pro-German literature was be
ing printed. Her husband is said to
be a Polish nobleman.
Automobiles Commandeered.
In addition to St. Stephen's Green,
various corner points covering the en
trance to the green also were occu
pied by the Sinn Feiners, who dis
played rifles from the windows of
nearby houses. Several passing mo
tor cars and taxicabs were command
eered. The occupants of these ma
chines were taken inside the green,
apparently as hostages, and the cars
were drawn up on tne roadway

volver firing, seemingly at nothing in
particular and several persons out
holiday-making have been killed or
injured.
Seized a Public House.
In the Portobello Road, over the
canal, which forms the boundary of
the city, the Sinn Feiners seized
corner public house. Here also holiday-makers
suffered from promiscu
ous shooting. One platoon of the
Royal Irish Rifles succeeded in dis
lodging and taking prisoners these
Sinn Feiners.
Isolated Individuals Shot.
During Monday officers and men in
khaki and isolated individuals were
shot at in the streets. Some of them
are reported to have been killed or
wounded.
Newspapers Suspend.
No evening papers appeared in Dub
lin Monday and no morning papers
were published today. The Evening
Mail ofijee was occupied by members
of the Sinn Fein yesterday. They
still retain their possession of ttie
building. The military " have estab
lished themselves opposite the Even
ing Mail office.
College of Surgeons Seized.
The Royal College of Surgeons was
seized by the Sinn Feiners and their
flag flown from it.
Thus far the revolters have captured
nothing by fighting. There was no
body to resist them and they simply
occupied unprotected buildings.
Military Has Not Shown Its Strength.
The authorities express the opin
ion that the trouble may last a day or
two. They say there is ample force
at the disposal of the government to
quell the entire disturbance with ease.
The sympathy of the neonlp irenr.
ally, they declare, is against the dis
turbers, but thus far the military au
thorities have not shown their
strength. They are no doubt anxious
to end the trouble with a minimum of
bloodshed and destruction of pro
perty. Shooting was Wild find Reckless.
It is impossible as yet to ascertain
or even approximate the number of
persons killed or injured, but there
is no doubt that the aggregate is
considerable, as the holiday crowds
were large and the shooting by the
Sinn Feiners was very wild and reck
les. Casualties Among Officers.

EIGHT GERMANS INDICTED
ON CONSPIRACY CHARGES
Accused of Placing Bombs on Ships
Carrying Munitions to Entente
Allies.
New York, April 2S. The federal
grand jury returned an indictment to
day against the eight Germans recent
ly arrested on the charge of engaging
in a conspiracy to place incendiary
bombs on ships carrying munitions for
the entente allies and against lr.
Walter T. Scheele, president of the
New Jersey Agricultural Chemical
Company, the alleged leader of the
conspiracy, who has not yet been ar
rested.
It was at Scheele's factory that the
bombs were partly manufactured it is
alleged. The indictment was found
on the testimony given by Captain
Charles Von Kleist, who was em
ployed in the Scheele factory and
Ernest Becker, an electrician aboard
the Hamburg-American Line Steam
ship Frederich der Grosse, on which,
also, it is alleged .bombs were manu
factured. Both were among those in
dicted, but have been promised im
munity, according to the district at
torney. The others are Captain Otto
Wolpert and Captain Eno Bode, of the
Hamburg-American Line; Carl
Schmidt, and Frank Carbade. Wilhelm
Paredes and George Praedel, assist
ant engineers on the Friedrich der
Grosse.
The indictment charges that the acts
in the conspiracy were committed be
tween January, 1915, and April, 1916.
It asserts that Dr. Scheele purchased
the lead used in the manufacture of
the bombs from J. D. Johnson and
Company, of Jersey City, at various
times in April, Vila, and on January
Sand February 2, 1916. On April 15,
Becker is accused of having deliv
ered to Wolpert a satchel containing a
number of the bombs.

Report-d by Sub-Committee to the
House Naval Committee.
"Washington. April 2S A draft cf the
naval appropriation bill, the second of
the administration's great prepared
ness measures, was reported by a sub

PROFITABLE TO ALL USERS
Results are what count, and experience tells when it comes to get
ting them, as is shown by the statement of J. K. Marsten, the repre
sentative of a large Boston banking institution, who declares that banks
get quick results from newspaper advertising. The use of newspaper
space results in new accounts for the bank. In his opinion calendars
were not particularly desirable advertising, but the fact that a bank
advertises in newspapers gives the public the impression that it is up.
to-date and alive.
"What is true of a bank is also true of every other line of business.
The banks profit because their facilities are thereby brought to the at
tention of a larger number than would be possible in any other way.

OPERATION OF MECHANISM
OF THE FAY TIME BOMB
li'ustrated in Court by a Government
Ordnance Expert.
New York, April 28. The operation
of the mechanism of the time bomb al
leged to have been invented by Lieut
enant Robert Fay for the purpose of
destroying at sea munition ships leav
ing this port, wash illustrated by a
government ordnance expert in the
federal court her today at the trial
of Fay snd his alleged co-conspirators,
Walter Scho-Iz and Paul Daeche.
According to the expert, James E.
Moore, in charge of the guns at Fort
Wadsworth, the Fay bomb was "in
geniously wicked." He testified that
he had tested the contrivance with ex
plosives and found that it worked
perfectly.
The machinery, contained in a metal
box three feet long, was explained in
detail by Moore. The bomb was ex
hibited on a table in the center of the
court room and held the interest of
the court and jury. Moore declared
that the bomb was so constructed
that it could bo set to explode as de
sired.
Immediately after the demonstration
of the workings of the bomb; a case
containing fifty sticks of dynamite
was brought into the room Tor identi
fication by Louis G. Fucihs, of Butler,
X. J., as some of the explosives pur
chased by other members of the al
leged conspiracy for use in the deadly
instrument. Fuchs failed to identify
the explosive and the case was hur
riedly but carefully taken from the
court room, much to the relief of tne
Jury and spectators.
