The revolt which broke out in
Dublin Monday has spread to other
parts of Ireland, chiefly west and
south. The real extent of the rebel
lion is kept secret. There seems to
be no doubt that the rising in Ireland
had been carefully planned for Easter
Sunday when the plotters probably
counted on many officials , and mem
bers of the military taking a holiday.
The German naval sally against the
English coast towns and the Zeppe
lin raid apparently were part of the
general scheme. John Redmond and
Edward Carron, the Irish leaders, are
loyal to the government.
There is a reason when the state of
Nebraska defeats her most distin
guished son as a delegate to his party
convention. If there are any great
men in America, Mr. Bryan, with all
his vagaries, is one of them. But as
a public man he committed 'political
suicide when ho turned his back on
the president in a national crisis. In
seeking to get into a convention made
up of President Wilson's friends, he
could only be looked upon as a trouble-breeder.
The Nebraska Demo
crats wanted harmony.
Representative David H. Kinche
loe of Kentucky will make three
speeches in the Second district of
West Virginia, where a special con
gressional election will be held May
9 to fill the vacancy created by the
death of the' late Representative W.
G. Brown. Watch out for Dave's
eloquence to set them afire with en
thusiasm. Mrs. L. J. Campbell, of Youngs
town, 0., while fishing at Boca Grande,
Fia., caught a tarpon weighing 158
pounds. 'She was awarded the Izaak
Walton gold button for catching the
largest fish or the season.

KAISER TAKES
HAND ifi CA
Asks Ambassador Gerard to
Grand Headquarters for
Heart to Heart Talk.
IS A HOPEFUL INDICATION
In Some Quarters Believed It
May Mean Personal Mes
sage to Pres. Wilson.
Washington, April 28. Secretary
Lansing has had ho further advices
from Berlin regarding the submarine
issue and the situation remains un
changed. Announcement in press dispatches
from Berlin that Ambassador Gerard
would confer with Emperor William
at the army headquarters was regard
ed by officials as being significant.
Official information on the subject
was lacking but the opinion was free
ly expressed that it was not at all un-
: likely that the emperor might have in
mind supplementing Germany's reply
to the American note demanding the
immediate abandonment of present
methods of submarine warfare, with
a personal communication of some
kind to President Wilson.
Ambassador Gerard in visiting the
emperor is not acting under instruc
tions receivSPfrom Washington.
Consequently officials assumed that
the emperor invited Mr. Gerard to
confer with him. In both official and
diplomatic quarters the injection of
the emperor s personality iiito the
situation was regarded as being a
hopeful indication.
President Wilson expects to receive
the German reply within the next
few days. Up to the present, in spite
of messages from Berlin, he is entire
ly without definite information of the
intentions of the German government.'
