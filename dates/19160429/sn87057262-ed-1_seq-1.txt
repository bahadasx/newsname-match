American Attitude on Armed Merchantmen

WASHINGTON, April 29.—There

on the boat situation today. It was
attributed largely to the knowledge
emanating from German diplomatic
sources both in Weshington and Ber

New Flurry In Berlin.
[By CarrW. Ackerman, United Press
Correspondent.]
BERLIN, April 29.—Publication Of
President Wilson's memorandum,
stating in precise terms the American
attitude with regard to armed mer
chantmen, caused a new flurry here
today.
No official comment was obtainable.
The average Berliner, whose first
wave of anger over the American
note had subsided, thought he saw
substantiation of the old charge that
the United States Is doing everything
to help England.
The statement in the memorandum
that an armed merchantmen is a
peaceful trading ship until conclusive
evidence to the contrary is offered,
was pointed to by several German
critics today.
"If I walk down the street with a
gun In my pocket, how does Presi
dent Wilson know whether my inten
tion is offensive or defensive?" de
manded one Berliner.
It is too early to say whether pub
lication of the memorandum will
cause any hitch in the German-Amer
ican negotiations which are now in a
satisfactory state. This information
probably will not be obtainable until
after the return of Ambassador Ger
ard from the army headquarters con
ference which was to begin today.
INCREASED WAGES PREVENT
STRIKES ON MAY DAY

At the same time, strikes, lockouts

demand of 175,000 anthracite coal

A lockout is momentarily expected
