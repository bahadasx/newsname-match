KUT EL AMARA
BRITISH ARMY
TAKEN BY FOE
General Townshend Surren
ders to Overwhelming
Forces of Turks.
IS OFFICIAL WORD
English Admiralty State
ment Admits Defeat in
the Mesopotamia,
London, April 29. Gen
eral Townshend, the British
commander at Kut-El-Amara
has surrendered.
The British force which
surrendered at Kut - El -Amara
amounts to about 10,
000 men.
Major General Charles Town
f.hn d, commander of the British
iorces besieged at fiut-KI-Amara,
Mesopotamia, by Turkish forces
since last December, has surren
dered. This information was con
tained in a British official state
ment issned this afternoon.
The official statement added that
(.eneral Townshend destroyed all
his gnus and munitions before
surrendering.
The following official announcement
was made:
"After a resistance protracted for
143 days and conducted with a gal
lantry and fortitnde that will be for
ever mpmnrflhlp funeral Tnwnchonn1
; . W -. l
has been cnmneiled bv the final ex-l
hauEtion of his supplies to surrender.
"Before doine so he destroyed the
guns and munitions. , K.Si?lif2Sl
"The force uuuer him consists of
2.970 British iroops of all ranks and
services and some 6.000 Indian troops
and their followers."
General Townshend probably was
driven to surrender to avoid starva
tion of his force. A recent official
Turkish communication raid that the
jiosition of the British at Kut-El-Amara
was critical and that they were ex
pecting to receive small supplies of
Jood by aeroplane. An official state
ment received yesterday from London
announced that a ship laden with sup
plies had been sent up the Tigris that
H had been grounded about four miles
cast of the city.
Iiss than a score of miles away is a
relief army which for months had been
attempting to reach the besieged forces
of General Townshend. Of late, how
ever the Turks' resistance has in
creased and aided by floods they hare
been able to hold the British in check.
So official figures have been given
out as to the number of troops which
set forth from the Persian gulf in No
vember of 1914 on the expedition which
has now ended in surrender. Unoffi
cially the number has been estimated
as high as 50,000, but it was probably
considerably smaller than this. This
force has suffered heavy losses in se
vere battles with the Turks.
End of Long Seige.
Karly in December last year General
Townshend's army was beaten in bat
tle at Ctesiphon, 18 miles below Bag
dad, and retreated to Kut-El-Amara.
.Since that time it has been beseiged by
a large army of Turks, cut off from all
communication with the out3ide world
except by wireless. During the long
seige the British had defended them
selves so successfully that the Turks
decided to starve them out. It had
been known of late that the situation
was becoming desperate. For some
time after the Townshend expedition
started out from the Persian gulf it
was Fteadily successful. It pushed up
the Tigris and Euphrates until in Sep
tember of 1915 it defeated the Turks
decisively in an encounter at Kut-El-Amara.
Then the invaders pushed on
to within a few miles of Bagdad, their
goal. They defeated Turks at Ctesi
phon, but later the Turks, reinforced,
compelled them to retire hastily to
Kut-El-Amara.

0BREG0N IS HOPEFUL
Carranza War Chief Feels
Conference Will Bring
Satisfactory End.
El Taso, Texas, April 29. Gen
eral Alvaro Obregon, minister ot
war of the dc facto government,
with the chief military command
ers of northern Mexico, made a
return call of courtesy this
morning upon Major Generals
Scott and Fnnston replenary to
the first conference between
American and Mexican military
officials that is largely to deter
mine the future course of the mil
itary arm of the United States in
Mexican territory in pursuit of
Francisco Tilia and 'his bandits.
Minister of War Obregon, with plen
ary powers from First Chief Carranza,
sounded a hopeful note with the ex
pression that "we should reach a sat
isfactory termination of these nego
tiations that will meet with the ap
proval of our people."
He, with Generals Trevino, Gutier
rez, Calles, Gavira and Santos, with
his civilian assistants, will contend
that the de facto government is ready
to take over the pursuit of the Villa
bandits and protect the border,- and
therefore the United States soldiers
in Mexico should be recalled, while
Generals Scott and Funston will
counter, it is understood, with the
proposition that American troops be
disposed in certain spheres of north
ern Chihuahua to remain until the
Carranza government has shown that
there is no longer a Villa bandit men
ace to the American border states.
Major General Scott said the con
ference might not be held today, but
Sunday or Monday. (
Discuss Conference Plans.
General Obregon and bis party
were met at the international bridge
by a troop of American cavalry which
escorted them to the railroad station,
where, on General Scott's private car,
the Mexican officials were welcomed.
The return call was of some length
and the plans for the first conference
were discussed. ,
Session May Be Brief.
The conferees believe negotiations
will be concluded early next week.
The American military representa
tives will be in close and constant
touch with Washington, and it is there
that El Paso believes the first news
will be made known of the outcome of
the conference.
The return call of General Obregon
was concluded at 11:30 o'clock. At
that time it was learned that the first
conference In all probability would
be held this afternoon. It is under
stood the meeting would be held in
Juarez.
More Troops Sent Over Border.
Columbus, N. M., April 29. Points
along the American line of communi
cation in Mexico are beiDg strongly
reinforced. Two companies of in
fantry inarched from the base here
early today preparatory to crossing
the border, while nearly one thousand
cavalrymen who left Columbus yester
day afternoon broke camp at Gibson's
line ranch, 15 miles west, shortly aft
er daybreak and crossed the frontier.
While no reason was assigned at
military headquarters for the new
movement of troops into Mexico it was
learned that the infantry assisted by
the engineering corps are to prepare
the roads for the heavy traffic of the
supply trains and for the coming rainy
season. This season frequently makes
the roads of nrothern Chihuahua al
most impassable.
Only routine reports were received
from the front today and none of these
gave any news of the column of Col
onel George A. Dodd, last reported
near Minaca in pursuit of fleeing Vil
1 ist as.
Dodd Re turns to Base.
Field Headquarters, Namiquipa,
April 28, (by wireless to Columbus,
N. M., April 29.) The column of
American cavalry under Colonel
George A. Dodd, which for six days
has been pursuing a large band of
Villa bandits through the rocky de
files of the continental divide, was re
ported today to have returned to its
base at Minaca.
The band is said to be practically
all dispersed, numbers of its members
apparently holding to the belief that
Villa is dead.
Training of
State Guard
Is Extensive
Springfield, III., April 29. Unusual
preparations for intensive training of
middle west national guard artillery
units at Camp Robinson, three and
one-half miles east of Sparta, Wis.,
are indicated by the war department's
inquiries which have been received at
the adjutant general's office here con
cerning the ability of the Illinois Na
tional Guard to furnishes horses for
the camp of instruction.
From June 1 to 4 at least 100 horses
will be needed at Camp Robinson.
From June 5 to June 14 400 horses
will be used and from June 14 to 24
the guardmen's training camp will re
quire 350 horses. From June 25 to Aug
ust 25 the camp will require 150 ani
mals. Incidentally the Illinois National
Guard will be unable to furnish any
horses suitable for the camp as it is
not deemed advisable to ship the 50 j
artillery horses received from the gov
ernment early in the winter and which
were distributed to the state batteries
this week. Three 'animals died after
an attack of shipping fever and these
were replaced. Ten horses each cost
ing $200 were turned over to the com
manding officers of the batteries at the
Union Stock Yards in Chicago, April
26, by Colonel S. O. Tripp, chief quar
termaster officers of the Illinois Na
tional Guard and then shipped to
their new home stations.
Battery C, at Fort Sheridan, owns
32 horses and did not receive any of
this consignment Batteries B, D and
E also own a few trained horses.
"The government provides forage,
shoeing and veterinarian expenses for
these horses," said Colonel Tripp, "and
one attendant for every five horses.
The state is required to provide
stables for the animals. The state's
artillery is expected to devolp wonder
fully now that each battery has a few
trained horses."
The rifle range at Camp Sturgis,
Vandalia, 111., was dismantled this
week and two additional target ma
chines put up at. Camp Martin Effing

RESERVE PLAN IS
EFFECTIVE SOON
Country Wide Check Clearing and Col.
lection Ruling to Start June 15 Fed-

Washington, April 29. The federal
reserve board announced today that it
would put into effect June 15 its new
plan for country wide check clearing
and collection. Under the plan the
actual cost of clearing and collection
of checks will be assessed against
member banks in proportion to' their
use of the system.
A circular announcing its decision
was mailed today by the board to 7,600
member banks. The important fca-
tures of the plan, the announcement
"The federal reserve banks will ac
cept at par all checks from member
banks whether drawn against other
member banks, non-member banks or
private banks. An exception is made
at the outset in the case of checks
drawn against non-member banks
which cannot be collected at par.
"All checks thus received from
member banks will be given immedi
ate credit entry although amount thus
credited will not be counted as re
serve nor become available until col
lected. "In order to enable member banks
to know how soon checks sent in for
collection will be available, either as
reserve or for payment of checks
drawn against them, time schedules
will "be furnished to member banks.
"The actual cost without profit of
the clearing and collection of checks
will be paid by the federal reserve
bank and assessed against the member
banks in proportion to their sendings.
"The whole plan is based on gener
ally accepted principles under which
clearing and collection plans have
long' been operated. A federal reserve
bank will not debit a member bank's
reserve account with items forwarded
for collection until the remittance of
the member bank in payment of such
items shall have had time to reach the
federal reserve bank."
SOCIALISTS ASKING
FOR LABOR MERGER
New York, April 29. A proposal
to merge with the socialist party is
one of the important questions before
the national convention of the social

When the socialist party recently
nominated Allan L. Benson for the
presidency by referendum, it also de
tided to authorize its executive com
mittee to name a committee to confer
with the socialist labor party's rep
resentatives regarding a union. It is
expected that today's convention will
appoint a committee for such a con
ference. The consummation of such a
union would heal a breach in socialist
ranks dating back 20 years.

London, April 29 (12:40 p. m.)
Parts of the city of Dnblin are in

Sinn Feins Hold Capital.
Dublin, Thursday, April 27, (via Lon

points.
Since Monday some of the chief po

The streets of Dublin were deserted

rifle fire was pattering apparently from
every quarter at the same time.
