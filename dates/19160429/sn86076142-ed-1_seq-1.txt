The fact that the troops were in grave
peril has been recognized for months
and the hope was entertained that
either the British or Russian forces
would succeed In forcing a relief col

ed force was entrenched with scant
rations. For over thirty days it Is
estimated the supply of food has been
insufficient for moru Mian one third

brought home to England when it be
came known that the commander had
compelled the civilian population to

ply of food might be eked out to the
