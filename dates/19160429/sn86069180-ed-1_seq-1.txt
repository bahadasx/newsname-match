TROOPS NEEDED IN IRELAND
Victor Herbert, the noted cotn-
poser and bandmaster, President of
" tho Friendly Sons of St. Patrick of
Now York City, and one of the chief
participants In the recent Irish race
convention, has Issued the following
statement In regard to Ireland's posi
tion In tho present war:
On tho memorable night in 1914,
after tho opening of the war, when
John Redmond arose in the House
of Commons and promised the sup
port of the Irish people to England
in this war, he In reality abdicated
the position he had held for some
years as tho spokesman of Ireland.
He camo out in his true colors as a
British Imperialist and a man to
whom tho welfare of England was
dearer and closer than Is the liberty
of Ireland. Tho truth Is that Red
mond has long ceased to be an Irish
man in everything but name. His
antecedents, his early training, his
social surroundings and enviroiu
ment, his long association with Eng
lishmen and English movements
and latterly his Interests all draw
him in the direction of England.
They have made him a convert to the
belief that tho preservation of the
British Empire Is a vital necessity to
mankind and that Ireland must be
content to play a very subordlnato
part In It in order that there may be
no disorganization -within tho empire
and no Interference with the Anglo
Saxon dream of governing the world.
He has of late years become
obsessed with the notion of English
might and power. Living in the
center of her empire he has been so
Impressed with her numbers and area
.83. to nnfnntiilr.,.thpni- wlt,h JCal,
strength. Ho has not seen, as have
so many thoughtful observers
throughout the world, tho cankers
eating away at her vitals and the
decay which has been sapping her
energy and her power. Thereforo
at tho outbreak of the war It seemed
to him Inevitable that England and
her mighty allies must conquer In
the strife against tho Central Pow
ers. Without stopping to consult
with the opinions, the sentiments or
tho interests of tho Irish people,
without oven, it is said, consulting
with, his associate members of Parlia
ment, ho staked all upon his belief
in tho Invincibility of England. Ho
committed Ireland as far as he
could to a policy which would havo
mado her forget tho past and forego
her rights, and havo bound her more
closely than ever to tho chariot
wheels of a triumphant and remorse
less England.
But Redmond failed to take Into
account either tho true strength of
tho Central Powers or the depth and
Intensity of Ireland's love of liberty
and hatred of oppression. He be
lieved, In common with the other
English leaders, that Berlin and
Vienna would be captured within a
few weeks after tho beginning of the
war, and that Germany and Austria
must epeodlly succumb to tho un
precedented combination of -forces
mado against them. How greatly he
and they errea is known even to the
ordinary observer hero In America
In splto of all that the overworked
censor can do to misrepresent tho
truth and to turn Allied defeats and
retirements Into victory and triumph.
Tho months that have passed have
shown only ono triumph after an
other for tho Central Powers and
today wo seo them upon tho soil of
their enemies winning victory after
victory and advancing from ono
triumph to another.
But it was with relation to Ire
land that Redmond was most wrong
and that his judgment was tho least
of all based upon facts. Colored as
his views had become toward Eng
land ho failed to grasp the fact that
tho mass of tho Irish people fol
lowing In tho footsteps of the genera
tions that had preceded them clung
tenaciously to their Ideas of nation
ality and their love of liberty and
could not bo cajoled any more than
they could bo forced to regard Eng
land as other than a tyrant and an
oppressor whoso rule was to bo borne
while it must oe, but was to he
thrown off as soon as possible and
"whenever God given opportunity
would enable tho men of ireiana to
An an.
Certainly Mr. Redmond had road
Irish, history to little effect If ho did
not realize tho saying of Wolfe Tone
hat "the connection between tune-
land and Ireland was tho curse of
Ireland" had unk Into tho very
heart of the Irish nature and was
ono of the most cherished beliefs of
ho mam of the people. He nurriea
to Ireland in his new ardor, made
himself the chief recruiting sergeant
of the King is a mad attempt to get
the young men of Ireland to go out
to fleht in Flanders or Galllpoli, He
dm failed moat lnglorlously even ac
cording to his own Rdmleelons tn
his effort to turn ireiana into a eon
-. inted province of England and have
' jtr Uke her place with the Allies of
England in this war 'of aueiMpte
extermination against peoples and
nations that have never Injured Ire
land or wronged or oppressed Irish
mon.
A month ago lie claimed 350,000
Irishmen had joined the English
colors. Driven from that absurdity
by tho showing up of the official fig
ures he reduced that number last
Sunday to 160,000. As matter of
fact, he is still more than 0,000
above the ofilclal figures. When one
takes into account the means re
sorted to In Ireland to drivo men out
of employment so they may havo no
cholco but to enlist; the campaign
of abuse and misrepresentation un
blushlngly carried on by the Gov
ernment in Ireland to arouse the
passions of the people and tho exist
ence In Ireland of that large portion
of tho people who Topresent what Is
known as the permanent garrison of
tho country, the result is quite
negligible.
It shows conclusively that tho peo
ple are truo to their old ideals and
will havo none of Redmond and his
new doctrlno of trusting to the jus
tice of England because England is
now In a desperate situation fighting
for her very life and ready to mako
any promise which will not require
Immediate parting with that control
over Ireland which she regards as
tho very breath of her life and the
deprivation of which would mean her
certain reduction to the position of
Holland or of Spain. Ireland today,
Redmond to tho contrary notwith
standing, is not with England in this
great war. Tho great mass of tho
people realizo that it is England's
and not Ireland's war. They have
no love for England or for English
methods or theories of government.
They have nothing but hatred arid
hostility for English government.
They have a burning deslro to see
English power destroyed and driven
out of Ireland, not partially or tem
porarily, but fully and for all time.
England has labored to shut Ire
land off from tho rest of tho world,
to keep out all news from the out
side and to prevent any information
from Ireland reaching the outside
world, and particularly from reach
ing America. But In spite of a meas
ure of success in this work, she has
largely failed, and news has been
going Into and coming out of Ire
land during the whole course of tho
war. This has enabled us to know
with certainty that Ireland is not
In any sense of tho word loyal to
England. If she were so It would not
bo necessary to suppress, as England
has suppressed, more than a dozen
nowspapers. It would not be neces
sary to mako arrests in every corner
of Ireland under the defense of tho
realm act, and to summarily drive
men out of their country without
written charges or even the farce of
a trial.
iUivonldnot.bejiecflssary to break. J
up meetings, intoriere witn gauier
Ings of tho Irish volunteers, arrest
and Imprison men In three of the
provinces for possessing arms, as
fourth. And, more than all, when
England and her allies are in such
dire need of men at the front, to keep
In Ireland the huge army of occupa
tion, which shows that England still
regards Ireland as a conquered coun
try and not as a contented, loyal and
satisfied English shire. The best
qualified and clearest minds in Ire
land recognize that victory for Eng
land In this war means an unsup
portable burden of taxation for Ire
land as her portion of "the victory."
Probably In no other way could Red
mond bo shown to bo more com
pletely out of touch with Ireland
than In his position on tho question
of increased taxation which is now
agitating Ireland from Cape Clear
to the Giants; Causeway.

EXPLAINED
The Slaying of Priests in Their
Churches During Present
Conflict.
moderate and Just Statement of
Prof. Aloys Schultcof Brown
University.
Actions Extreme in Appearance
Carried Out in Good
Faith.
TWO EXTREMES IN THE CASE
During the present great war In
Europe priests have been slain In
their churches by the Invading sol
diery. Much bitter controversy has
beencreatofl-thoreb-. In France and
Belgium It Is charged that this was
but one of a series of premeditated
brutalities coolly planned by the
German Invaders; in Germany It Is
said, on the other hand, that the
number of priests who were slain has
been greatly exaggerated and that
those who weio thus killed were Il
legitimately engaged In assisting the
enemy and thus deserved the fate
which was alloted to them. In the
formor countries It is moreover as
sorted that Protestant troops wero
especially chosen to enter Belgium In
order tho more thoroughly to wreak
vengeance on tho conquered people.
This Is emphatically denied by tho
Germans.
A more moderate and just explana
tion of tho whole matter Is given by
Prof. Aloys Schulo, of the University
of Bonn, a noted historian and a
Catholic, in a recent issue of the In
ternational Monthly Review for Sci
ence, Art and Technique. Prof.
Schulto says:
"In times of war In all countries
only ono rule is recognized, all with
out exception aro bound to obey the
laws promulgated by the military
authority. " Church servants who are
not strictly connected with their
parish church naturally escape tho
suspicion of tho enemy. To tho
Protestant preacher and tho rabbi
church, or synagogue are a house for
preaching first and then a house for
prayer; their use Is confined to ono
day In a week. Preacher and rabbi
very often wear a dress that prevents
their being recognized aB such. The
relation of the Catholic pastor to his
church is much closer; he there
holds his Tellglous services every
day, there the Blessed Sacrament is
kept. If he wishes to go to tho sick
or wounded to bring thorn the
Viaticum he first must visit tho
church and afterward return to It.
The Protestant pastor or tho rabbi is
not forced to go to the church build
ing whllo tho combat is going on,
but tho Catholic priest must remove
tho Blessed Sacrament from tho altar
to savo It from disturbance and must
conceal it. He can be easily recog
nized by his attire.
"Wo thereforo can readily under
stand in the first place that an invad
ing enemy more frequently meets a
Catholic priest in the church building
than a Protestant minister. If the
alien soldiery are storming a church
tower to destroy tho rifle machine
which, has been placed there, almost
certain destruction is due to the
pastor who happens at such a time to
leavo tho church. Can it not be
clearly seen how tho soldiers would
in such an Instance act in good faith
and at the same time perhaps slay an
absoluely Innocent man?"
It Is always well In matters such
as these to take into consideration
tho whole circumstances In a case. In
war many things occur which in or
dinary life would be Impossible. The
situation of the invading army in the
Instance mentioned here can readily
be grasped. It can certainly he seen
hour Us actions might be extreme in
appearance and yet be carried out
entirely In good faith, as stated by
Prof. Schulte. C. B. of C. V.

STATE DEMOCRATS IN HARMONY
A typical example of the Roose
velt booster Is shown In tho Louis
ville Herald of Thursday morning
In the published statement of Matt
Holt, a Bull Moose t leader, the
statement Deing one oi a sunea ue
lng run by the Herald telling the
people why Roosevelt is needed as
President. Tho headline, to start
with, was misleading, it reading,
"Says Country Calls Colonel," but
In the article doesn't tell what they
are calling the Colonel, as many
are calling him a "four llusher,"
"blusterer," "fake fire-eater," and
even other things too rough to print.
Rooseveltlan style Is shown in ono
of the expressions used by his local
follower:
"Wo will have as Presidont a
leal man with led blood in his
veins. Tho United States will no
longer eat dirt. Let us havo Roose
velt and no pussyfooting."
Tho Rough Rider himself could
hardly Improve on that rather in
elegant suggestion about tho "United
States eating dirt." Furthor along
Mr. Holt shows himself to bo a
humorist when he stated that
"Theodore Roosevelt, courting un
popularity of the most violent kind,
has led America to tho verge of a
great change, less commercialism,
and an awakened patriotism." Can
you Imagine Teddy courting unpop
ularity the greatest self-advertiser
and grandstand player tho world
has ever known?
Roosevelt blustering and bluffing
tactics aro shown In the way ho
has bulldozed, and bluffed the old
line leaders in tho Republican party
he having told them "you'll take
me or a third party opposition
again" tho bluff having worked to
perfection, and it is pretty near all
over but tho shouting. Tho Rough
Rider will bo given the nomination
In tho Chicago convention to the ac
comDanlment of a lot of horso play
and flag waving, with specially
trained cowboys from tne wua ana
wooly West to whoop 'em up
through the proceedings.
To tho credit of tne majority or
tho Republicans they seo through
Rooseevlt's tactics and know him
for what ho is a player to the
naileries and a press agent (for
himself) all tho year around. But
the Progressives for the most part
are composed of the guiuoie Kinu
who swallow all of that bunk and
can be depended upon at any time
to work themselves Into a frenzy
at 'the mention of the name of their
Idol. They will bo found In groat
numbers at Chicago going around
wild-eyed, furnishing an lnexhaustl
blo supply of enthusiasm for tho
promotion of their favorite. Very
tew of this class of people over
take a conservative vlow of any
thing and they aro easy marks for
popular fakes of tho Munchausen
type, tho mysterious giant of Bar
hum & Bailey In other words thoy
come under the head of those whom
Abraham Lincoln said, "You could
fool all of the time."
With the nomination of Rooso
velt tho American people will wit
ness another repetition of the
Bryan campaigns of 1896 and 1900.
Roosevelt will tour the country,
making fiery speeches, breathing
brimstone and fire against all of
the other nations of the world, and
as in Bryan's case he will be
cheered by millions, but again as In
Bryan's case these millions somehow
or another will Vote tho other way
on election day. In Bryan's case
If everyone that cheered him had
voted the Democratic ticket his ma
jority would have been too big to
