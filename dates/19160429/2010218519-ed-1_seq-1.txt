Mighty War Debt
T-HE longer the day
1 of settlement may
t; be postponed beyond
the sea the more fear
fc ful will it be. When a
I soldier finally goes to
Jr his home, he will owe
I a greater debt than he
I . will have the capacity
to pay. And it will be
the same way from the
emperor or prime min
ister to the peasant.
' The governments can
not repudiate their
debts, but how can they
pay them? The cora
ls mon people will cer-
tainly struggle to find
r new homes. And what
land the world around

It our own. We cannot
M understand how our

j prepare our people for
ji that time, beginning
f to have the ships ready
to ship away our sur

t that is not a very pro
fitable business it can

M HE life of Frederick John Kiesel is the story of a builder, the history of a man who over
d (T came the difficulties of pioneer days, and by great labor and wonderful financial genius
J founded the basis of success and built for himself and his family large fortunes. It is
a story of the type of man, who, through long struggle and unfaltering courage, trans
formed the West from a wilderness to a great industrial empire.
Frederick John Kiesel was born May 19, 1841 in Ludwigsburg, Wurtemberg, Germany. When
only sixteen years of age he emigrated to the United States, arriving in the spring of 1857.
The lure of the west was strong, the gold craze in California was at its height, railroads were being
pushed west of the Mississippi, and ox carts carried the more hardy of the adventurers across the
Rockies and into the great country beyond.
Mr. Kiesel cast his fortunes with these sturdy pioneers, arriving in Utah in July, 18G3, intending
to proceed to Montana. He was induced, however, to remain in Salt Lake City, by the firm of Gilbert
& Sons, who, at the instance of General Connor sent him that fall to Soda Springs to act in the ca
acity of sutler for Company H of the California volunteers, and to conduct a general store near
the settlement. This was his first venture in the mercantile world. The following spring he returned
to Salt Lake and again took up his work with Gilbert & Sons. But in the fall of 1864, seeing the

started that should be jH
encouraged. Next to jH
the mines the factories jH
have been the greatest iH
source of wealth in H
our country for fifty iH
years, and one of the H
pledges to be exacted H
from candidates this 'H
year is that a righteous H
tariff will have consid- H
eration at once when H
congress meets again. H
Farmers and stock H
men should keep in H
mind these days that H
meat is too high; that H
with their other crops H
this year they should H
each raise a surplus H
sufficient to fatten a HI
dozen extra beeves in H
the autumn; or a hun- H
dred extra pigs or H
sheep. H
Irrigation should be H
greatly extended each ;H
year. It insures the H
crops; it makes them H
better! it doubles the H
product of the soil; H
there is no good rea- H
son why food prices H
should be so high as H
they are here in a H
sparsely-settled region tH
like this. Farmers "H
should study their land H
with an eye to the time H
when from beyond the H
sea poorer men than H
they will come here for H
the avowed purpose oi
selling everything that 'H
they can raise from the M
soil and the stimulant H
will be the desire to ,M
get wife and babies M
here where at last M
there will be food M
enough for them to eat. ' M
There should be M
some community farm- M
ing done here. Where M
a man has a large l M
amount of land, more ' M
than he wants the care H
of cultivating it all, he H
should lease a part of jil
it. The Interstate Com- jH
merce Commission M
should have one matter 4 H
explained to it, which is H
that the cheaper prod- H
ucts of the soil should I H
be given cheaper rates H
near the great cities, to H
prevent competition I
from off across the sea. I
