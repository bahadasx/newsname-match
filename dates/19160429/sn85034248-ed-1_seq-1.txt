"Ghosts" at the Gem Today.
"Gholt:," a five-part Mutual Mas
terpicture adapted from Henrik Ib
sen's irmortal drama, will be the at
traction at the Gem Theatre today.
This vivid play is presented by an all
star cast, headed by that great mo
tion picture actor, Henry Walthall
who plays the part of the degene--ctc
Alving and his unfortunate s,:
The production is superbly stage'! and
costumed, and holds the audience
spellbound from first scene to last,
not only by the plot and action of the
story--or rather its wonderful mes
s sage---but by the tremendous force of
the actin;g and the artistic beauty of
the pictures. An outline of the play
is as follows:
Alving, a dissolute rake. dies of his
ex!.esses. leaving a son, Oswald, who
grwsi up into a young man of excell
en!. habits and morals. Oswald's moth
er has been warned by the family phy
sician that the son might inherit the
vices of the father, but she ignores
the advice. As Oswald merges into
manhood, however, he begins to show
signs of being mentally unbalanced.
In the meantime his mother, who
wants to see her boy marry early, ar
ranges a match with a young girl with
whom he is in love. The physician
arrives at the church in time to pre
vent the marriage. disclosing the
fact that Oswald and the girl are
brother and sister. The boy is so
overcome when he learns the truth
that he plunges into dissipation, as
the taint of insanity becomes more
apparent. Finally, realizing he can
not escape the "clutching hand of
heredity," he dies of poison admin
istered by his own hand.
Notable Offering at The Gem.
It is seldom nowadays that a cast
of well known actors and actresses
appear- in such a perfectly balanced
assemblage as in the film version of
Clyde Fitch's sensational success,
"The City," which will be the offering
at the Gem tomorrow. "The City"
Is heralded as one of the most mem
orable screen attractions to be pre
sented here this season, embodying
as it does a theme of tense and grip
ping' drama, abounding in situations
that rise to the most poignant heights
of the playwright's art, enhanced and
made more vital by all the additional
elements of life and action imparted
by the possibilities of the camera and
the screen.
In addition to Thurlow Bergen in
the powerfully sympathetic role of
Banker Rand, there appears William
chrater 1ts a inother care u1
study to those which he made in sup
port of William Gillette, E. H. Soth
ern and .J.er noted stage stars. Bes
sie E. Wharton, a delig-htful and
finished actress, as Mary Hall, Rand's
cast-off light o' love; Dick Stewart,
an exceedingly popular juvenile star;
Mae Edney and Frank Goldsmith, the
latter- a former Frohman leading man
of exceptional brilliance and experi
ence, complete the roll call of the
principals, but in the ensembles
with which the picture abounds hun
dreds figure, as for instance in the
great ball-room scene and the portion
of the film depicting the famous curb
market during a big- flurry in steel.

- THE CITYL
V ~ POO~~
"The City" created a never-to-be
forgotten senmation in New York, on
the night of its first performance at
the Lyric Theatre. The drama cul
minates in a climax of such terrific
power that at its premiere women
fainted and became hysterical, before
a mighty wave of frenzied cheering
and applause relieved the feelings of
the stunned audience.
"The City" is the story of the lure
and lust of the crowded places, where
the battle is to the strong and the race
to the swift. It deals powerfully
with a powerful theme. It is epochal,
cataclysmic ilmosr t in its terrific
Sweep and merciless logic.
In "The t;it-" me and women and omn de
velop their own weaknesses. Amidst
the clash and cirash of ihuman passions
in the Great T'Ion, the ancient doc
trine "of the sins of the fathers" is
visited to the full on the heads of
George Rand. Jr., his unfortunate
sister and others involved with them
? in the crucible of "The City."
Valli Valli at the Grand.
The five-part Metro photoplay.
"Her Debt of Hlonor," with Valli
Valli in the stellar role, will be shown
at the Grand 'Theatre tomorrow. This
production promises to create a sen
sation, as it is full of surprises and
thrills andt abounds in novel situa
tions. The story was written by Wil
hfi. Nigh, who directed the piece,
and also appears in the cast. Others
supporting Miss Valli are Frank Ba
con, who appeared in Cohan & Harrih
stage productions for eight years and
is considered one of the foremosi
leading character comedians on the
stage or screen; William Davidson,
a new-corner in filmdom, but who has
ichieved unusual success as leading
.nan; .John Goldworthy, R. A. Bresee,
dean Hume, Mrs. Mathilde Brundage
and other stage and screen artists.
"Chimm;e Fadden Out West."
Monday's bill at the Grand will
bring before the local photoplay pub
lic the popular American comedian,
Victor Moore, in "Chimmie Fadden
Out West," said to be a fitting suc
cessor to Mr. Moore's other entertain
ing productions, "Snobs" and "Chim
mie Fadden."
Chimmie Fadden is a character of
American literature likely to live as
long as Tom Sawyer or other famous
youths of fiction. Chimmie is city
bred. He is a product of the Bowery,
with all the instincts and mannerisms
of the city ragamuffin, whose vision
of life is limited by sky scrapers and
stone pavements.
What happens to Chimmie when he
goes to the far west, becomes a min
ing prospector and tries the simple life
is most interestingly told in "Chim
mie Fadden Out West."
Theda Bara in "Sin."
The celebration of the greatest and
most widely observed of Italian reli
gious festivals, the feast oJf Our Lady
of Carmel, is faithfully pictured in
all its interesting and colorful details
in the William Fox production of
"Sin," which comes to the Grand
Tuesday. The seething crowds, the
gaily decorated stalls, each displaying
wax emblems for the votaries of the
feast to offer in. gratitude for ills
cured, the flags and the blazing lights
of a score of colors are all seen in
this wonderful picture in which Theua
Bara is starred. It is like a leaf torn
from one of the most interesting sides
of New York's kaleidoscopic life,
The great parade, which is the fea
ture of the celebration and in which
thousands take part, each marcher
carrying a huge candle, which are in
some cases so immense that they re
quire three bearers, was "shot" by di
cameras so placed that no detail es
caped the lenses, and the whole vivid
rector Herbert Brenon, with' six
picture is flung upon the screen in all
its scintillaing :life and movement.
W. S. Hart, the famous Broadway
favorite, and undoubtedly the great
est living portrayer of western roles,
pla;'1 the principal part in "The Bar
gain," which is announced as the
Grand feature ;for Friday next.
In the first scene, the country is.
alarmed by advice that Jim Stokes, a
"two-gun man," is in the neighbor
hood headed for the border, and warn
ing is given to place a double guard
around the stage on its trip through
the canyon. This warning is needed,
for Jim is planning to hold up the
stage and obtain a package of gold
on it consigned to the express com
pany.
The stage is seen traversing a wind
ing roadway through the marvelous
scenery of the Grand Canyon, and at
an opportune bend in the route Jim
cleverly holds up and robs the stage,
extra guard and all.
Jim has the lead in his attempt to
escape, but his pursuers are close on
his tralil and he is wounded and his
horse killed from under him. How
ever, he manages to lose himself in
the Bad Lands, and painfully makes
his way to a spring, where he falls
unconscious.
From this situation Jim is rescued
by Nell Brent'sfather, who takes him
to their home and Nell nurses him
back to health. He falls in love with
his pretty nurse, and without reveal
ing his identity is married to her.
Conscience-stricken, he determines to
return the stolen money to the ex
press company, and riding t4) the
nearest station for that purpose,. is
horrified to find a poster announcing
a thousand dollars reward for his
capture. He is seen and recognized,
almost immediately, and the sheriff
organizes a party to arrest him even
while Jim's horse ij hitched at the rail
ing of the store: He learns the in
tent, however, and again makes a dar
ing escape with his pursuers crowd
ing close behind.ý` He rides his horse
into a pool of water, to lose the trail,
puts a note undue the saddle for his
waiting bride, md sends the horse
home. Again he starts on foot, but
is finally captured in a typical west
ern hotel combining saloon, gambling
rooms and dance hall.
While waiting with his prisoner un
til train time, the sheriff is attracted
by the revelry of the rooms below, and
going downstairs, gets into the game
and loses all of the stolen money he
had just recovered from Jim. Re
turning then to his prisoner whom he
had left in handcuffs, the sheriff said,
"I'm a bigger thief than you are, Jim
Stokes. I've lost the money you stole
from the express company,"
Seeing the sheriff's predicament,
and wishing himself to be free, Jim
proposes the bargain that if the sfer
if will let him go, he will recover-the
money. This is agreed upon, and
Jim's handcuffs are removed. He
then arms himself, and going out
through the window, enters the gamb
ling room and holds up the cashier.
He gets the money, rushes out in the
wildest excitement, mounts a horse,
and is again pursued, The flight this
time takes him to the edge of a great
precipice with the posse at his heels.
k-Without hesitation he chooses the
plunge to capture, and horse and
rider are seen rolling over and over
down the steep cliffside. Jim again
escapes, covers his trail and reaches
the hotel just in advance of the
searching party. He enters the room
in a semi-fainting condition; tpris
over the money to the waiting s
is handcuffed, and hastily tummIeS;
°o bed just as his pursuers come to
the door and, gaining admittance, ex
plain that the game had been held up
and they thought in some way Jim
might have escaped and "turned the
trick."
The next day the sheriff starts with
his prisoner, but safely away from
tihe town, he looses the handcuffs,
jgives Jim two hours' start to get his
bride, and wishes him good luck, thus
fulfilling his part of the bargain.
Jixi returns to Nell, is forgiven,
and together on his horse they ride
over the hills across the border to an
other state, where the law could not
molest them, to begin life anew in
spired by the love which alone makes
possible the right unraveling of life's
tangled webs,
Next Saturday's bill at the Grand
will comprise the second episode of

"THE BIRTH OF A NATION."
Famoui PFm Booked For Four-Day
Engagement in Baton Rouge.
It will be welcome news to resi
dents of this section that the "Birth
of a Nation'' is booked for a four
days' engagement at the Elks' Thea
tre ina Baton Rouge, beginning Sun
day night, April 30. The company
that will present this wonderful film
epic of the civil war and reconstruc
tion is the same that played 98 con
secutive performances in seven weeks
before 150,000 people at the Tulane
Theatre, New Orleans, and the mar
velous production will be seen in Ba
ton Rouge exactly as that vast multi
tude of Crescent City playgoers saw
it.
Except on Sunday, when the entire
day will be required for installing
the production, there will be a mati
nee every day, making in all seven
performances. The advance sale of
seats began Wednesday morning,
April 26, and mail orders accom
panied by money order or check on
Baton Rouge banks will be carefully
filled., The prices will be: Nights.
best downstairs seats, $2; front s
downstairs, $1; balcony; first
rows, $1.50; balance, $1; box seats,
$1; gallert not reserved, 50 cents.
"The Birth of a Nation" will not
be shown within 100 miles of Baton
Rouge, and this engagement will af
ford playgoers hereabouts their final
opportunity to see it. As readers of
the newspapers and magazines know,
"The Birth of a Nation" has swept
the entire country like a tidal wave.
It is a vast review of the events of
the civil war and reconstruction pe
riods, supplemented by love interest
borrowed from Thomas Dixon's
world-popular novel and play, "The
Clansman." Among the scenes are
President Lincoln signing his first call
for volunteers, the Confederacy's last
stand at Petersburg, Sherman's march
to the sea, the burning of Atlanta,
Lee and Grant at Appomattox, the
assassination of President Lincoln
and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan.
The wild rides of the Ku Klux Klan
in the second half afford many thrills.
A symphony orchestra of twenty
five, carried by the company, plays
the grand operatic accompaniment,
and altogether the services of fifty
people are employed in each presen
tation. The production was eight
months in the making and cost $500,
000. In the battle scenes 18,000 peo
ple and 3000 horses are shown.

The bowels are the natural sewer

become obstructed by constipation a
part of the poisonous matter which
they should carry off is absorbed into
the system, making you feel dull and

MOUNT HOUMAS STOCK FARM
Hogs, Cattle end Horses Being Brec
on Ascension Plantation.
That there is a future for live stoet
development in the sugar cane par.
ishes of Loriisiana is being demon
strated by the Colonial Sugars Com
pany, large holders of sugar lands it
several parishes on the east bank ol
the Mississippi. The firm's Mt. Hou
mas plantation, in Ascension parish
within the past two years has beer
converted into a live stock farm.
where in prior years it was strictly a
sugar property. The development in
.:ttle and swine has been rapid and
promises much for the future.
C. N. Wogan, general agent of the
Coloniil Sugars Company, informs
Modern Farming that they now have
on Mt. Houmas 478 head of cattle al
together, of which 133 are grade
Herefords. The Hereford is the
breed to be specialized in, with a view
to developing in the breeding game,
and on the plantation are 15 register
ed cows and 5 registered bulls, all
very high-class animals. About 300
head of hogs are also being raised.
Instead of fattening cattle for. the
market, feeders ar'e butchered at Mt.
Houmas and shipped by train down
the river to the big sugar refining
plant owned by the Colonial Sugars
Company, in St. James parish. At
the refinery there is a refrigerating
plant with a capacity, equal to storing
six to seven carcasses, and most profit
able disposition of the beef and pork
as well is thereby effected.
Mr. Wogan reports that they are
also to enter into the raising of
horses and mules on Mt. Houmas
plantation, and a good start in that
direction has been made by the.pur
bhase of 20 Percheron mares,4la; p-aal,
selected within the past severatfweeks
by the herdsman, C. B. Pittman, on a
trip to the wes.t. In this acquisition
of draft horses, they are being used
to displace mules in the working of
the crops raised on the property.
And with the double utility of breed
ing and working, ,it is to be expected
that the initiative taken by the
Colonial Sugars 'Company will lead,
in time, to the adoption of the idea
by numbers of other Louisiana sugar
firms in the working of their cane
crops with draft- horses from which
they can secure horse and mule colts.

UPHOLDS USE OF BEER.
Dr. Stein Says Beverage Helps Morale
of Troops at Front.
(The author of the following article,
Dr. Max Stein, is director of the Associa
tion for the Distribution of Beer in Ger
many. This organization copes with the
tremendous task of supplying the entire
German army with beer. Directar Stein,
who is a Swiss citizen, recently visited the
United States for a short stay and his
shrewd observations will interest those who,
care for constructive criticism and en
lightened advice.)
By Dr. Max Stein.
Every day the Association for the
Distribution of Beer in Germany, of
which I am the director, sends 1,500,
000 liters of beer to our soldiers at
the front.
Everyday railroads, motor trucks,
pack animals, steamships, are carry
ing great shipments of beer to our
soldiers in Russia, in Germany and
in the Balkans.
The average American cannot un
derstand why the German government
spends millions of dollars and uses
valuable transportation space in car
rying what you consider luxury to the
front. But that is just the point.
We do not consider beer a luxury, we
consider it a necessity, and we be
lieve the health of our troops would
suffer greatly if for any reason the
beer supply were cut off.
Before I came to America I could
not understand this attitude of the
American people. To me it seemed
unbelievable that America should
send an army into a waste country
like Mexico and subject them to the
dangers of poisoned water holds and
typhoid, when you might so easily
transport beer. But since corpg to
America I begin to understanriaid
have visited your drinking plat ho.
which are only frequented by mertuve
where men stand up at a bar and one'.
man treats the other in succession,
and where drinking is more of a busi
ness than a pleasure, and where one
never sees a woman, or if there is a
woman, not of the better class. In
Germany, it is different. One goes
into a German restaurant where the
whole German family sits at a table,
orders food and drinks beers. The
first thing in the morning the Muenich
woman drinks her stein of beer, and
yet I know that German women do
not become slaves to the habit the
way American women become slaves
to the cigarette and the cocktail.
You notice that the men who have
been foremost in the fighting around
Verdun are the Brandenburgers, the
Badeners and the Rhinelanders.
Those men come from provinces
where more beer and wine are con
sumed than probably any other ter
ritory in the world. You can draw
your own conclusions from this, as
to whether the moderate drinking of
beer and wine destroys the whole
saomensre ~of tieapeople or break,.
. Another taing bot generally ktwno
abroad is that the Austrian army was
under strict prohibition during the
early part of 'the war. After the
battles in the Carpathians, the Aus
trian army was reorganized, and one
of the first reforms was the introdite
tion of beer into the army. Now the
Austrians have organized ,a bureau,
such as our German bureau, and the
Austrian army gets about the same
amount of 'beer as our own army.
Since the reorganization, you know
that the morale of the Austrians is
60 per cent better than it was. I do
not mean to imply by this that the
improvement is due to beer, but beer
evidently played a part and today the
Austrian military chiefs would no
more think of sending out an army
corps without beer than it would with
out bread.
On the side of the Allies I want to
call your attention to the fact that it
is not the prohibition Russian army,
nor the English who have made the
best showing. The backbone of the
Allies is the French army, who drink
their wine as we Germans drink 'awn
beer.
I am not attempting here to -'
p arge the temperance move~rint.
Only you in America and we on the
Continent have an entirely different
view of what constitutes temperance.
f do not consider that the German
who takes his beer with his meals,
tnor the Frenchman who takes light
wine in the same way, is intemperate.
I consider the Russian peasant, who
used to get drunk every day on vodka,
but who, now that Russia has pro
hibition, has substituted varnish for
vodi:a, intemIpreate. But I suppose
your American prohibitionists would
class all three nations as intemperate,
and the only truly temperate nation
Turkey, which drinks neither w'imne
nor beer, nor hard liquors.
My own. view of what constitutes
temperance agrees pretty much with
the French. If you will read the
tract sent by the French Medical So
ciety to the soldiers at the front you
will see that while the men in the
trenches are warned that a nip of
brandy is delusive, and strong liquor
of every kind habitually taken leads
without fail to diseases of the stom
ach, liver and mind, a distinction is
made in regard to fermented liquors,
such as wine, beer and cider. Fer
mented liquors, the French soldier is
told, may be safely used in modera
tion. This is what we, on the Con
tinent, consider real temperance re
form.
