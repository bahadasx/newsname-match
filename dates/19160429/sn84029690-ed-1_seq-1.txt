Young people will take pride in looking on this institution as their
bank, and they have the privilege of coming and going just as much as

"Father and the Boys," a splendid
comedy, was put on the screen at the

Mr. J. -W. Preston who has been
j forester at the Experiment Station the
I past five years has resigned his position
and will leave Hajs in a short time.
I He has not decided exactly where he
will go but perhaps to some city in the
eastern or southern part of the - state.
Mr. Preston moved to Hays with his
family in April 1912, and took charge
of the forestry department at the Fort
Hays Experiment Station and under his
experienced management it has very
materially improved. When he took
charge the growing stock invoiced less
than $300, one year afterward 1913,
the sales amounted to $325. In 1914,
$670, and in 1915, $1650. Mr. Preston is
a thoroughly, practical and "nursery-
wise" nurseryman and a valuable roan
in his line of business. The Hays Ex
periment Station will probably "escpari
ment" a long time with other men De
fers they find as good a man as J. W.

Watch the Children.
One of the most important causes of
i ill health so prevalent among people of
en- 'li - j : rr r i
: ait ages is Liitt iiiuiiiererice ui yujr
i in regard to apparently trivial com
plaints of children.
A child complains of pain somewhere
j head, back, chest, abdomen, hips: per
S haps leg-ache; does not sleep well, cries
The Misses Clara and Lulu Cerney ! 0.u. n sleeP or is troubled with Enure-
physician is consulted. Many times he
laughs at the mother's anxiety and tells
her the child will "outgrow it." That
is conclusive evidence that the doctor
does not know what is the matter with
the child; therefore concludes there is
nothing the matter.
One who has made a special study of
children and who understands child
psychlogy , knows that the average child
with average care will never think of
complaining unless there is something
the matter.
In fact children go on about their
play when grown up people would be in
bed. Children often stay up and play
long after they should have been hav
ing medical attention. Many times the
busy mother does not suspect the baby
is ill until she finds him lying on the
floor or in the yard and upon question
ing gets this reply, "I am so tired."
This is often the beginning of some
serious sickness.
Children never have "growing pains."
That is one of the excuses for things
not understood. All pain of whatever
nature in children is abnormal. It is
quite true that some of the complaints
of children need not be taken seriously.
It also is true that children will recover
from diseases which would be fatal to
adults.
It must be borne in mind that chil
dren are like young plants, very tender
and easily injured and stunted in mind
and body for life, by some trouble
which in childhood seemed of little con
sequence or importance.
Therefore we should take cognizance
of every complaint of childhood no mat
ter how small it may seem and obtain
advice of one who undertands children.
This will be doing only a parent's duty
and may save many regrets later.
The first duty in life is to give our
children health. If we give them life
we must give them the best opportunity
within our power to enjoy it.
The only fortune of real value to
youth is physical and mental health.
