El Paso, April 29. Two facts enter
ing the conference which began today
between General Alvaro Obregon, rep
resenting Mexico, and Generals Hugh
L. Scott and Frederick Funston, rep
resenting the United States, set aside
the belief that the negotiations might
be dragged out . for any great length
of time. One' was that General Obre
gon came to the border with full pow
er to act in behalf of his government
iin any arrangement that may be made
for- the disposition of Brig. General
Pershing's expeditionary-force.
The other was that the Mexican min
ister of war bad summoned to the
conference , of the military governors
or the three Mexican states touching
American territory, x
With General Obregon in possession
of plenary powers, time will . not be
consumed, in. telegraphic communica
tions between Juarez and Mexico City.
The attendance at the conference of
military governors P. Ellas Callea of
Sonora, Ignacio Enriquez of Chihua
buu, and Jacinto Trevino of Cahulla
means that all matters affecting a pos
sible patrol . of northern Mexico by
American troops can be quickly and
aenniteiy ttnreshed out. , On these men "

Nominal Fines for
Club Officers Who
Sold Intoxicants
In -view of the fact that they have
recently received- a cliab license from
the county . commissioners who- say
they are a bona fide club, the officers
of the Young Bmmet club, 1,326 Main
street, were fined only $10 each -by
Judge Wilder in city court today. They
were charged.- with violating the ex
cise law by selling liquor without a
license. x
Liquor Prosecutor A. J. Merrltt said
that the Emmet club had applied for a
club license at the time of the raid
being foad upon their club rooms
February 27. He believed that as the
county commissioners had seen fit to
recognize the Emmet club as a bona
fide organization it ' would be only
proper to impose a small fine on each
officer. He said that ' although the
club now has a - license, nevertheless,
the officers we guilty of deviating the
liquor )aw at the time of the'raid.
Judge Wilder imposed fines of $10
upon President Patrick Savage, Pat

SEEK TO PLACE
CIVIL BLAME IN
LESSERTRAGEDY
Lawyers Take Prominent
Part in Coroner John J. T
V Phelan's Inquest.
SMITH DEPRIVED OF
HIS DRIVING LICENSE
Physician Says Woman's
Death Was Directly Due
to Auto Accident.
The question of civil responsibility
for the death of Mrs. Eir Lesser fig
ures prominently in the questioning of
attorneys before Coroner John J. Phe
lan in his Jnquest into the demise of
the well known Bridgeport woman.
Dr. C. N. HaskellJ who attended Mrs.
Lesser, Mn answer to Inquiries In ine
inquest today, said that in his opinion
Mrs. ! Leaser's death was due' to In
juries frorn the automobile mishap,
and to that cause alone,
'Mrs. Lesser-was struck by an auto
mobile driven by Raymond Smith, son
of rr.Edwards M. Smith of 967 Park
avnuev whose license to drive an au
tomobile is indefinitely suspended, by
Secretary of ,: State "Burnes, . awaiting
the outcome of the inquiry; The mis
hap occurred Saturday night, April 8",

is at liberty pending'the out
come of the inquest. . A .

nature of the injuries ' and said Mrs.
Lesser sustained deep laceration of the
soft tissues.' causing pulmonary em
bolism which brought deathv-1 He de
scribed how treatment was adminis
tered her at the Bridgeport .hospital,
but because of the severe nature or
her injuries theurgical treatment was
unavailing. .
Mrs. Lesser was crossing Clinton
avenue at Fairfield avenue at night In
a storm. Riding with Mr. Smith was
Miss .Marjorie DeLoss,daughter of Har
ry H. DeLoss of , the board of educa
tion. ; Mr. Smith- was not present at
the coroner's hearing today but was
represented by Attorney James A
Marr. Attorney Jacob A Klein, broth
er of Mrs. Lesser, was present. ' j
In answer to the coroner s ques
tions, Mrs. Frances Strauss, sister of
Mrs. Lesser, said they went out to
gether to visit another sister, Mrs. Max
J. Buechler, who lives in Clinton ave
nue. - It was raining. Mrs. Strauss
said she crossed the street in advance
of her sister about ten feet when she
looked back and saw her sister lying in
the roadway; at the rear of an automo
bile. Whether the car passed over
her -was not determined by the physi-
cins who attended her. "
Attorney Marr pointed out that sev
eral poles and 'a large tree at Clinton
and Fairfield avenues hides the view
of motorists who turn north on Clin
ton avenue from Fairfield avenue. He
also said there is a deep shadow from
the electric light directly over the"
place where Mrs. Lesser was struck.
The hearing was continued, indefi
nitely until other witnesses can be
summoned.
Police Board Not
Likely t Appoint
Policemen Tonight
Up to a late hour this afternoon it
was expected that no action, would be
taken -relative to increasing the police
department when the police commis
sioners . meet tonight. There is a
vague possibility, however, that the
board may go through with the ap
pointing of the policemen and pro
long the promotion of officers until
next week.
The promotion of Capt. John H.
Redgate to the post of Superintendent
was definitely decided upon two weeks
ago but several other promotions have
been the means of delaying the ap
pointment - of policemen.
Smith's License to
Operate Automobile
Indefinitely Held Up
Secretary of State Charles Burnes
has notified Acting Superintendent
William H. Anderson that the oper
ator's license of Andrew R. Smith,
867 Park avenue, has been suspended
indefinitely. Smith was operating the
automobile that ran down Mrs. Eli L.
Lesser, 94 Elmwood place, April lb.

STRANGE THEFT ,
IN OFFICE OF
FELIX LAUTER
While He Attends Trial of

VISIT OF PROWLER
STARTS SPECULATION
He Scouts Theory That For

The offices of Felix Lauter on the
third floor of the Warner Building
were entered and robbed "early yes
terday afternoon. . Nothing but a type
writer and possibly, some ' papers
which were within a suit-case on the
floor was taken, as far as will be ad
mitted todayr -;
The robbery, committed in a bold
manner in the light of , day presents
a deep' mystery and with the fact that
Felix Lauter and his office associate.
Alex. Szabe representing the Auatro'i
Hungarian Labor' alliance, were both
attending the trial of Robert Fay in
dicted for consniracv to blow nn mun
ition ships, it Ms considered in many
quarters to be more than an ordinary

The office of 'Iiauter Is situated on
the . ell of the floor so that its en
tarnce is far from the sight of others.
An extension of the hallway leads to
a broad fire-escape onto which a win
dow ef the Lauter office opens. '
It is believed that the thief opened
this window,' crawled through, and
procededat his leisure to rifle the of
fice. A suit-case was broken open.
Clothing and papers belonging to
Lauter were found scattered all over
the floor.- The desk of Szabe was not
touched as, far as can be ascertained.
When the unbidden intruder departed
be carried with him- a new Smith
typewriter and possibly some papers.
Discovery of the illegal entrance
was made upon Lauter's return from
New York; where he is expected to-be
a witness in the Fay trial. He de
clared today that he did not report
the matter td the police but is making
a personal effort to trace the machine
through the pawnshops.
Lauter . today scouted the rumor
that his place might have been enter
ed by the agents of foreign govern
ments' who learning of his reputed
connection with the Fay case might
have been anxious to ascertain from
his papers if there Mas anything of
value in his phonograph inventions
that might be of value to their gov
ernments. George Auger To Be .

"Fagan had been drinking and was
not steetdy on his feet. I warned him
he was in danger on the platform, but
he wouldn't move. The lurch of the
car as we rounded the curve threw
him off." .
This in substance Is the statement
made to Coroner John J. Phelan to
day by" Conductor Henry Stone from
whose car. Edward Fagan fell early
Monday morning and received injuries
from which he died last night In the
Bridgeport hospital. Stone told the
coroner Fagan was the only passenger
on the car at the time. He insisted
on standing in the vestibule near the
steps. Stone said he warned Fagan
twice, but the latter only answered
that he -was "all right." His skull
was fractured.
Wesley Megus, motorman of the car,
testified it was near-ing the end of the
line at Barnum avenue and Mill Hill
avenue and going slowly at the time.
Fagan was an assistant foreman for
the Bridgeport Brss Co. He lived at

MORE THAN 100 REPORTED KILLED
Upwards of 100 persons have been killed or injured thus far
in Dublin, says the Belfast correspondent of the Evening News
in a despatch f i . 1 lastvnight. He' says the rioters, hidden in
houses a. important street junctures, are keeping up a steady
fire. - ..
TV cordon of troops is being drawn gradually but surely
around the rebel strongholds. The authS-riiies ;ire carIng on
their difficult task with the greatest forbearance. Every effort
is being made to avoid unnecessary riots and damage.
STRICT CENSORSHIP COVERS DETAILS -.
I Although the .story of the early hours of the Dublin upris
ing has now been disclosed in considerable detail, England is
still without authentic information as to the progress of later
events. Neither telegraph, telephone and mail" services, with
Ireland have been restored and the existing means of communi

to obtain only fragmentary iniormationr
Such, news, as does come througn
adds little to that contained in lasi
night's official despatches and stories
of eye-witnesses. So far as official
reports show, i the situation in Dublin
is gradually bfeing "brought under con

news, that the rebels have been driv

the rebels are fighting for their lives
which they know may be forfeited on
account of treason.
The . streets of Dublin were desert

from behind curtained windows. Field
guns were barking, machine guns rat

parently from every quarter at the

When the Associated Press corres
pondent Janded early this morning at
the quay near the custom house the
whistling of bullets from rifles of
snipers was frequent. Augustine Bir

made the passage from England with
the newspapermen. " As he stepped
ashore he shouted cheerily:
I "I wish you luck, gentlemen. I
don't know what will happen to you,
now that you are here."
Soldiers and rebels fired at each
other from street corners, wharves,
roofs and windows, sentries with .fixed
bayonets stationed every few yards,
shouted their commands to halt.

ORGANIZATION OF
REBELS IS LAUDED
BY EYE WITNESS
Did Not Fear Their Fate,
r They Tell Bishop
of Cork.
London, April 29 The Times pub
lishes an -account by an eyewitness of
the Dublin uprising which emphasizes
the excellent .organization of the
rebels and the fairly 1 successful ef
forts of the leaders to restrain rioting.
This- account says: -
.."The citizens were not' molested in
the streets and much of the firing was
of .blank, cartridges. There, was an
effort to show that the movement was
strictly military in character anddi
rected only against the populace.
There was little rioting but only about
10 or 20 shops were entered. There
was no violence against private per
sons and as long -as you did not wear
a uniform you were - as safe walking
in Dublin streets as In the streets of
London.
. "This shows a remarkable difference
from the Dublin. riots two years ago
when it was not safe -for anybody to
walk in the streets for fear of violence.
During last Monday's and Tuesday's
trouble the populace could go where
they liked."
"We planned to rise simultaneously
with our Dublin cohorts, but some
thing went wrong with the arrange
ments," said a leader of the Sinn
F&iners ln( Cork in an interview pub
lished here today. "We might have
been in possession of the post office
but for the fact that the military was
there first. I do not think we will
rise here but if they come to demand
our arms we shall shoot them. When
the news of the Dublin uprising
trickled through here we retired to
our armored . barracks, loaded our
rifles, polished bayonets, set in stores
of provisions and prepared for any
