Wrench Into the Machinery of the Illinois Bar
Ass'n There Are Some Sore Heads.
Real fireworks were popping be
hind the scenes of the big feed given
to Teddy Roosevelt by the Illinois Bar
ass'n crowd at the University club to

friends were banqueting and boosting
T. R. along, several of the minority
were quite peeved and tried to throw

about the banquet having been shov

McChesney and the other bosses of

claimed that it was t "very indecor

Teddy speech is the greatest way he

bers of the ass'n were not going to
