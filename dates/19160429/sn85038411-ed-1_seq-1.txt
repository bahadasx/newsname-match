London. April 2''.—Parts of the city of Dublin arc in flames, an'
Evening News dispatch filed at Belfast last night says. Street fight- j

One dispatch received from Ireland this afternoon says that

Dublin. April 27. —Fifteen hundred or so armed men of the Sinn
Fein had a hold on Ireland's capital to-day. After four days of fight-!
ing their rebel flag still flew from a number of central points.
Since Monday some of the chief positions in the city have been
in the hands of the rebels. In defending these strongholds against
regular troops and Irish nationalist volunteers the rebels are fighting
with desperation for their lives which they know may be forfeited on
account of treason.
Regulars now command all the rebel positions, the tall of which
ir merely a question of time.
The streets of Dublin were deserted to-day. except for sentries
and military guards. Husines> was at a standstill. Civilians peeped
anxiously from behind curtained windows. Field guns were bark
ing, machine guns rattling and rifle tire was pattering, apparently
from every quarter at the same time.
Wh?n the Associated Press corre- 1
spondent landed early this morning
at the quay near the customs house
the pinging of bullet from rifles of
snipers in the vicinity was frequent.
Augustine Birrell.the secretary for Ire
land. had made tlie passage from Eng
land with the newspapermen. As he
stepped ashore he shouted cheerily:
"I wish you luck gentlemen. 1 don't
know what will happen to you. now
that you are here."
Naval Ciuiis \<ld to l>iu
Soldiers and rebels tired at ea> h
other from street corners, wharves,
roofs and windows. Sentries with
fixed bayonets on loaded rifles, sta
tioned every few yards shouted their
commands to halt. Naval guns join
ed in and added to the deafening gun
fire.
From the quay the respective posi
tions could be seen. The rebels were
holding a square section of territory,
from the point where Liberty llall
stood before a gunboat destroyed it as
fnr as Sackville street, to St. Stephens
Green and the Four Courts district,
and along the southern side of the
river to the Butt and OVonnell
bridges. They also held isolated posi
tions in a flour mill and a disused dis
tillery opposite the Northwall station.
Rebel Flag Waves
Over all this section there was con
siderable fighting the whole day. The
distiller)' was the scene of one of the
•sharpest little battles of the uprising.
The rebels were forced out*of the flour
mill by bombardment and many of
them were seen, covered with flour,
making their way to the distillery.
Once there they hoisted the rebel flag,
which floated from the corner of a
square tower.
Soon a naval gun opened fire. The
fust shot hit the tower, and then half
a dozen in succession struck the roof
around it. The flag still flew and the
rebels replied with rifles and a ma
chine gun.
The bombardment ceased after a
dozen shots, but was renewed later.
Hit after hit was scored, but the Hag
remained hanging from its pole. One
shot hit a water lank just below it and
for a time there was a miniature cas
cade down the walls of the distillery.
When night fell and all firing ex
cept with rifles ceased the flag was

WOMEN'S FIRST
AID CORPS AT
STATE CAPITOL
Class of Girls on Ground Be
fore Men Woke Up to Their
Opportunity
An active first aid corps of over a
hundred members has been organized
among the employes of the State De
partment of llealth in the Capitol.
Several months ago Commissioner of
Health Samuel G. Dixon, arranged that
the employes of his department should
: receive a series of iertures and be
| drilled under a practical instructor in
i rendering first aid In its various
'brandies. A member of the depart
ment's medical taff who had tauglit
1 first aid in the t'nlted States army
! was chosen for the work and classes !
| for both men and women were or- i
i ganized. A keen rivalry has grown up
between them as to which will turn 1
| out the most efficient teams.
] In two Instances within the past
' week when accidents and sudden 111-
I ness occurred in the Capitol, members j
j of the Department of Health's women's j
I first aid team have been on the ground
I before anyone else and rendered as
sistance. This has greatly chagrined '
| t|ie men who are drilling regularly and
i waiting for an opportunity to demon
trate their skill.
This organization will probably form
the nucleus of the safety organiza
tions in the Capitol which Governor
Brumbaugh suggests in a letter which !
lie sent this week to the various de
partment heads requesting them to act
as an advisory committee to outline
plans for safety work throughout the
State institutions and organizations.
J | Orders have been issued by Dr.
Dixon for the instruction in first aid
of the nursing staffs of the 115 State
; tuberculosis dispensaries. Classes have
also been organized at the State sana

. Labor Party Considering
Merging With Socialists
New York. April 29. —A proposal to |
ujergc with the Socialist party is one \
.of the important questions before the
i national convention of the Socialist-'
; Labor party here to-day.
When the Socialist party recently |
i nominated Allan L. Bensen for the
presidency by referendum it ifclso de- 1
T tided to authorize its executive com
mitte to name a committee to confer
with the Socialist-Labor party's repre
sentatives regarding a union, it is:
expected that to-day's convention will
appoint a committee for such a con
> furence. It is said that members of
Ihe Socialist party have been discuss
ing such a merger ever since the i
death, about two years ago, of Daniel
I Dc Leon, leader of the party in this
t state. The consummation of such a .
i union would heal a breach in Socialist
i ranks dating back twenty years.
