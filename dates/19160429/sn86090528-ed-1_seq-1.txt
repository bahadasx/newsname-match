SWIPE CAR
IN SHADOW
OF CO. JAIL
The fellow who stuck up a saloon
keeper in front of the Central police
station in Kansas City a few days ago
had nothing in the "nerve" line on
the lads who swiped the auto from in
front of the county jail last night.
The sheriff, a couple of his deputies
and Frank Burrows, deputy county
clerk, were making -a round through
the railroad yards, looking for car
merchandise thieves. Mr. Burrows
- -
well-behaved car could possibly stand
anvwhere. When Sheriff Bailey and '
his party arrived at the jail at 12:01
this morning, a naked expar.se of
brick-paved street occupied the spot
where a few moments before the
"monster oi me roao nau stoou.
'"i""' "".,
tlio iilinim tip rncnnmiprl with his
car and a chase was at once started.
In the Castleman car rode the owner
of the "lost, strayed or stolen," with
oereu oi nis peace snip. naiu
shouted Castleman. The joy-riders
gave the buggy a little more gaso-
1 line poured he juice to it, in lieu
oi u wmp, wumu imvc ureu m
case had it have been a good, old nag.
and turned into Minnesota avenue on
two wheels.
On Ninth street another turn was
mae and the kidnaped car traveled
', southward in a cloud of dust. Near
j the south city limits the pursuers
drew up on the pursued; a shot was
fired in the air and the drivers of the
stolen car permitted their vehicle to
swerve to one side. It struck a tele
phone pole, badly shaking the pole
and wrecking one of the lamps of the
car. '
The delinquents surrendered to the
deputy and were returned to the city
and locked In" the county jail, where
they are now locked up awaiting ar
raignment before Judge Davenport.
The "joy riders were two boys of
about 15 years of age. each,' who
gave their names to the officers as
Willie Rose and George lledrick.
They say they took the car just to
have' "a little ride."

MILITARY
AND NAVAL
EXHIBITS
Starting Monday, Uncle Sam Will Send
"Safety First" Special on Tour of
Country to Show Work of
Departments
MODELS OF BIG GUNS
INCLUDED IN DISPLAY
Torpedo and Portable Wireless to Be
Seen; Weaiuer Bureau, Public Health
Service and Other Branches
of Federal Activity
By United Press.
. Washington, April 2:). With ... thq
present interest that is being taken,
by the people in national prepared
ness, the exhibits of the two military,
branches of. the federal government
on the "Safety First" special, -which.
starts from Washington Monday, May,
1, on a tour of the country, prOmiBes,
to attract much popular attention.
Both the navy department and thei
war department will have cars devot
ed exclusively to displays of appa
ratus a nl models of apparatus used
by these departments. These will
give the citizens of the country a
glimpse of the manner in which Un
cle Sam is prepared to deal with,
emergencies that may arise,
The navy department will show
models of the great guns that are on
the battleships and will have men
from the navy to explain their work
ings. There will be a modern ma
chine gun, similar to those now being
used in the European war, and also a
rapid fire riotchkiss gun, o a type
formerly use by the navy. A six
pound gun of the latest design used '
on ships will also be exhibited. Ex
act models of .the pre-dreadnaught
Vermont and the commerce raider
Columbia will also be shown. The
latter is an example of an obsolete
type, the scout cruisers now taking
their place.
Perhaps the greatest interest in the
navy exhibit w ill be centered in a
torpedo, the typebf instrument that
has caused so much death -and de
struction in the European war. The
navy men on the car will explain that
each torpedo costs from $4,000 to $8,
000 and that many of them are used
in warfare. The navy has obtained
from one of its submarines a portable
wireless outfit which will be carried
with the car and will be in working
order at all stopping places. Mes
sages will be received and sent daily
and the visitors will be permitted to
witness tne station under actual
working conditions.
The- war department is Keparlng
an equally interesting exhibit for Its
car, but has not yet gone far enough
with the details to permit a descrip
tion of the apparatus to be carried.
The weather bureau, department of
agriculture, is now installing on its
car a mammoth weather map, which
each day will set forth the prevailing
weather conditions , throughout the
country, including the temperature,
. rainfall and storm conditions. The
bureau will receive the forecasts
from the Washington office every day
and the map will be corrected accord
ingly. The powerful Arlington wire
less apparatus at Washington twice
daily sends out the weather forecast
with special storm warnings, and ar
rangements are now being made to
have the navy department wireless
catch these reports to be displayed
011 the traveling weather map. It is
claimed by the weather bureau that
the storm and flood warnings given
out at various times have saved to
the citizens of the country millions of
dollars of property and- thousands of
human lives.
The great lesion of sanitation as a
preventative of disease will bo illus
trated in many ways by the. public
health service. This Rervice is the
deally enemy of hte .t. which is con
sidered one of the most prolific car
riers of dread disease, and will show
the visitors how bouses and stables
