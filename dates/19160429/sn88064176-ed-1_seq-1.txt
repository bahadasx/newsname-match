From Representative G. A. Foster.
To My Friends and Fellow Democrats
of Grant Farish:
Permit me to express my grati
tude to you for having honored
me with the office of Representa
tive to represent Grant parish in
the Legislature for the next four
years. I have made no glitter
ing promises to induce you to
vote for me, but in consideration
of the confidence that you have
expressed, I will say and promise
what I have felt all the time. I
will give the best services to our
parish and State that I am capa
ble of rendering, and especially
will I be found doing all that I
can at all times to build up the
small farm districts of this par
ish and State, and try to make it
easier and more profitable for the
small farmers of our hill sections.
I am, Respectfully,
G. A. FOSTER.
