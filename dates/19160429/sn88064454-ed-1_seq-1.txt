Made Investigation.
Sheriff Martin informed us that
he and his deputies made a tho
rough and searching investigation
regarding the baby that was pick
ed in the bayou here last week,

to the guilty party. The baby
came from up the bayou possible
as far as Arnaudville, as it was in
a bad state of decomposition.

NECROLOGY RESOLUTIONS.
St. Martinville, La., April !9, 1916
To the Grand Knight, Officers,
and Members of St. Martin
Council, Knights of Columbus
No. 1276.
Brothers:
We, your special committee ap
pointed, respectfully beg leave to
report the following preamble and
resolutions:
No sadder duty has ever devol
ved upon a committee on Necrolo
gy than the one we are now called
to perform-the framing of an ex
pression of the profound sorrow
which overwhelms every Knight
of Columbus of this Council when
his mind reverts to the death of
our late Chaplain and Dear Pastor,
the Rev. J. B. Morin, who passed
from earthly existence into eternal
life the 17th., day of April, 1916.
God, our Supreme Ruler of the
Universe, has in His inscrutable
will sent forth the grim reaper
death and cut down and gathered
unto Himself, our greatly beloved
and distinguished Brother. In
his death our Council and the com
munity have sustained an irrepar
able loss. As a Pastor, friend and
Knight of Columbus, he was the
embodiment of all that is religious,
noble, upright and true. He was
gentle and affectionate and un
swerving to duty as the needle to
the pole, and as you dwelt amidst
these enchanting environments
you were captivated, by a simpli
city that was beautiful, a confi
dence that was inspiring, truthful
ness that was overwhelming and a
piety that was divine. Fidelity
and constancy were his watch
words. He was a hard worker,
faithful to his calling and constant
ly busy with his church, but no
matter how busy, he always had
time to generously help his bre
thren, especially the young boys
in whom he took a great interest
to have them educated in Catho
lic Seminaries for the priesthood.
While all that was earthly has dis
appeared, all that was immortal is
with us as an inspiration and en
couragement to zealously guard
and judiciously guide an Order
that was dear to him; in all of
which, by his zeal, genial disposi
tion and many excellent traits of
Character he won for himself the
esteem and respect of the entire
brotherhood of our Council, and
for all of these qualifications, we
will ever cherish his memory and
deeply deplore his loss. Now,
therefore,
Be It Resolved, By the Council
in session, that while we deeply re
great the loss of our beloved bro.
ther and Pastor, yet we humbly
submit to the will of Him our God,
who doeth all things well.
Resolved further, That a copy
of the foregoing be spread upon
the minutes of this Council and
that a copy be furnished for publi
cation and to Rev. Father Trotoux.
Respectfully submitted,
