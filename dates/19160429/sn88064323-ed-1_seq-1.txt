MME. KALICH
APPEARS IN A
MASTER DRAMA.
Greatest Tragedienne To Be
Seen in Her First Great
Photodrama.
Greatness Undisputed.
She Is Bernhardt's Only Ri
val; Is To Be Seen Only
in William Fox Films.
Bertha Kalich, one of the great
est of actresses and the ouly dra
matic arlist in the world who can
be seriously considered as the suc
cessor to Sarah Bernhardt, has
signed a contract with William
Fox to act before the motiou pic
ture camera and appears in the
recently released photodiaiua
'Slander. "
This dramatic celebrity, whose
own personal story is as compe'
ling and vitally interesting as the
greatest role she has ever por
trayed on the stage, has entered
whole heartedly into a work,
which, if predictions may be in
dulged in, will even increase the
reputation and fame which are
hers as the result of the many im
portant achievements ot her past
stage career.
Mme. Kalich has been much
averse to appearing in motiou pic
tures until the felt very certain
that the picture plays selected for
her were of the quality and type
designed to introduce her favora
bly to the American photoplay
public and in such a way as to add
to her artistic achievements.
After weeks of negotiation with
William Fox and others—several
producers held out tempting of
fers —she reached the decision
that Fox pictures provided her
the finest opportunity for growth
in an art with which she has been
but slightly familiar.
And to fulfill his promises from
the beginning Mr. Fox has order
ed that the first production for
Mme. Kalich be of greater excel
leuce, in the point of lavish and
costly mounting, than any picture
he has thus far made.
Her entry now into pictures un
der the William Fox management,
where great attention is paid to
the selection and the staging of
strong emotional plays, gives real
promise that m photoplay Mme.
Kalich will become even a greater
ariist than before.

to appearing under
Harrison Grey FIs fee's manage

Kalich also played the part of Mi
riam in *'The Kreutzer Sonata,"
Marta in the Spanish drama,
"Marta of the Lowlands;" De
Gresac's "Oora," Therese in
'Therese Kaquin" and in "Sappho
and Pbaon," all of these being
Fiskeproductions. In vaudeville
Mme. Kalich appeared in a drama
tic sketch, "The Light of St. Ag
nes," which introduced her to a
still different type of American
theatregoers and greatly iucreas
ed her popularity.
Everywhere she was bailed as
an artist of great emotional
power, who was bound to become
one of the dominating women of
tbe American stage. Throughout
a score of succeeding plays, some
financially successful and others
either moderate successes or
financial failures, Bertha Kalich
permanently established herself.
BETTER OB WORSE.

We copy the following from a
[Mid-West magazine, Liucolu, Ne
braska:
"We've been flattering our
selves that this is the greatest age
in all the world's bistorj; that
this civilization of ours is the
highest civilization the woild has
ever known. Yet this very day
nations representing over half of
the really civilized people on the
globe are flying at one another's
throats. Of the four most highly
civilized and progress've nations
of the earth, three are engaged in
a death grapple.
We are sending missionaries to
darkest Africa and benighted In
dia, sleepy t'hina and idolatrous!
Japan, our purpose being to teach
them the gospel of love and peace
as promulgated by the lowly Na
zarene. And yet we who pretend
to be so much better thau the
heathen, are either witnessing or
taking part in the most stupen
dous and most causeless war in
history. If this is civilization it [
needs fixing! If this is Christian!
ty, we uetd a new religion!"
There is no question but we've
helped prolong this war. All the
while we've been praying for
peace we've never ceased adding
fuel to keep the conflagration go
ing. And this we have done in
such a way as to lead the Germans
to believe that we are decidedly
partial to the allies although
claiming to be neutral Now the
papers tell us our President has
sent Germany an "ultimatum."
Would not a really Christian
nation say there can be no last
word between friends!
Would a really Christian uatiou
have sent an armed force into
Mexico after Villa? The good
shepard goes out himseif after the
lost sheep aud baviog recovered
him, theie is mote joy in Heaven
over the lost sheep than over the
ninety and nine which went not
astray. Had some priest, some
kindly, good man or good woman
whom Villa respected and loved
gone in seat eh of this desperate
mislead man, couldn't we have
hoped for a more sanguine result?
As it is, there is no telliDg what
the end will be. Thousands of
dollars and many lives will be sa
crificed,even with tbe most favora
ble termination, while there are
strong probabilities of our becom
ing involved in a war such as
Roosevelt aud Hearst have been
yearning for, lo! these many years.
Aud then how easy it will be to reach
hands acioss the sea and join in
the mad dauce of death that
threatens the destruction of our
civilization.

ASK BRITAIN TO
LET DYESTUFFS GOME,
Washington, April 21—State
Department officials were prepar
ing today to make representations
to Great, Britain to insure the
safe arrival in the United States
of 15,000 tons of dyestuffs from
Germany. Notice that the Ger
man government bad agreed to
peimit the shipment came in a
note presented to Secretary Lan
sing by Ambassador Von Bern
stoff.
Germany at first declined to
permit shipments of dyestuffs an
less in exchange for American
goods, now excluded from Get.
many by the British blockade.
The note says, however, that Ger
many, in realization of the fact
that the blockade had seriously
affected American textile manu
facturers in need of dyestuffs,
now agrees to permit a single
shipment, with the understanding
that it is not to be reexported to
Great Britain or her allies.
The concession made by Ger
many resulted from a loDg series
of negotiations between the two
countries.—Ex.

mosphero of a peaceful Euglish

of a tuuuel under the river, to the
position of Governor. He bights

he had committed murder several
years before and in the tight with

Even during the strenuous
