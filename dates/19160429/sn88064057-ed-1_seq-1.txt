Fresh Vegetables
Aid To Health
It is a well-known fact that fresh
vegetables make up a very iimall
part of the diet of the SouithernI
farmer's family.v It is i.n" ible
to make an accurate etiiiiteto of
the value of the vetetal,te'- \\hici
may he grown in homte galdetl, inll
the South, but it is safe to sA. that
a well-kept garden will ictld a re
turn eight to ten times as great as
the return from an equal area de
voted to cotton or to other general
farm crops. Of even greater im
portance than the money value of
the products of the garden is the
satisfaction of having a bountiful
supply of vegetables close at hand
they can be secured at a moment's
notice.
Vegetables and fruits furnish a
large part of the essential salts
which are absolutely necessary to
the well-being of the human sys
twn!, so that the value of vegetables
in the diet is a great deal more than
the mere food or money value. The
need of tonics and other medicines
in the spring is due largely to the
lack of vegetables and fruit in the
winter diet. If more succulent
food were available, less money
would be spent in doctor's fees
and for medicines.
Fresh vegetables from the home
garden are not subjected to ex
posure on the market and are not
'liable to infection. Many vegeta
bles lose their flavor within a few
hours after gathering. The home
{vegetable garden is worthy of
greatly increased attention by the
Southern farmer, and a larger
number apd greater variety of crops
should be grown in the garden.

W. N. U. Auxiliary: The ad
vertising manager of one of the
biggest mail-order houses in the
country, in a talk before members
of an advertising club recently
gave some interesting infogmation
on how they secured much of their
business. He said:
"We have a bureau whose duty
it is to read each week the country
newspapers from all over the count
ry. There is not a paper of any
consequence in our trade territory
that our bureau does not get. This
bureau looks over these papers and
when we find a town where the
merchants are not advertising in
the local paper, we immediately
flood that territory with our litera
ture. It always brings results far
in excess of the same effort put
forth in tetritory where local mer
-Your local merchants can kill
?much of the business of these for

regularly in your paper. Here is

believe that advertising is profita
