FIREMEN TELL OF
THEIR WORK HERE
REVIEW OF EFFORTS DURING THE
PA8T FIVE YEAR8 3HOWS THEM
TO HAVE BEEN EFFICIENT IN
THEIR WORK
Editor Herald:
It seems tbo present administration
Is determined to place the blame for
the present condition of the Fire De
partment upon tbo old Volunteer Flro
Department. Wo did not Intend to
state our side of tbla controversy un
til, "Tho To Bo Recalled" members of
the council made a statement In the
press, and tbls statement waa follow
ed by n similar statement by tho may
or, both tending to discredit us in the
minds of the citizens, especially do wo
regret this since tho city officials after
bnvlng accused us of having sold city
property, and upon investigation found
this not to be a fact they decided to
drop tho matter, while we were will
ing to have tho matter threshed out
and aro still willing to do ao, know
ing that we wero In no way guilty of
criminal intent.
Aa an organization we have been
serving the city to our best ability for
tho past fourteen yeara. During that
time our only revenue or benefits have
been what we have collected from
dances and a donation unaollllted from
tho citizens, amounting in all to SI,-
701.01. Of this amount $293.00 was
n donation, tho remaining $1,408.15 was
derived from dances. Of thla total
wo have paid out somo for ruined
clothing, medical assistance, for mem
bers and others Injured during ser
vice; also for equipment, such as
chairs, bath and toilet fixtures, stoves,
tables, books and numerous other
Items (some of which should have been
paid by the city), amounting to 1701.15,
and the remaining 11,000 was divided
among the members.
Tho money divided waa earned sole
ly by our own efforts and we bad legal
ndvlco assuring us that wo were well
within our rlgbta ln doing so. who
would begrudge men who have served
the city ao faithfully, thla amount,
since It was the only compensation
they bad ever received during their
long service? Should we be criticised
for not caring to turn this amount over
to men who failed to meet us half
way and turned ub down so uncere
moniously T
Wo have realized tor some time tbat
thoro could and should be some Im
provement made in the department.
When Invited by the city officials to
meet with them and offer suggestions
nnd aid to Improve the fire depart
ment, we appointed a committee of
three of our members, that met witn
the fire committee of the council on
two occasions and framed rules and
regulation that were agreed upon as
being satisfactory to both the council
and the fire department Tha plans

THE PUBLIC WHAT HE THINK8
THE CITY EXPECTS OF ITS

To the Electors of the City of Klam
ath Falls, Oregen:
I take It for granted that "every
thoughtful citizen and taxpayer of the
city who Is olive who Is alive to the
city's Interests are agreed that the
ohe fundamental, paramount requisite
to tho prosperity and well being of
the city Is a conservative and business
Uko administration , of its govern
mental affairs. My candidacy for the
office of mayor is based upon that idea
and If elected It will be 'my ambition
to give tho city Just that sort of an
administration. I shall take my seat,
if elected, absolutely unpledged to any
Individual, or faction, free to exercise
my best Judgment in the Interest of
the entire city. I am cognizant of the
fact that wbllo the government of the
city is committed to three branches
or departments, the mayor is not only
executive head of one department of
tbo city but Is primarily and actually
responsible for the character and ef
ficiency of the administration. Ba
peclally la thla true of the mayor as
head of the street, fire and police de
partments of the city. In the manage
ment of theso departments, I shall, If
elected, employ tho same business pol
icy that has enabled me to make a
success of my own affairs.
Respectfully yours,

CITY EXECUTIVE
TO THE VOTER8 OF KLAMATH
FALLS:
Aa a candidate for mayor of your
city at the election to be held next
Monday, it is fitting that I outline as
briefly as possible the principles for
which I stand in the administration of
your city affairs and upon which I am
seeking your support at the polls.
To begin with, I believe that Klam
ath Falls la at the parting of the ways.
We-are now at the end of a long period
of business depression that has been
felt all over the United States. Cap
ital, which was withdrawn from pro
ductive enterprises following the be
ginning of the great war In Europe,
is beginning to seek new fields for In
vestment and the Weat coast Is due for
the moat prosperous development In
Its history since the rush for Califor
nia In 1849. The Klamath country
abounds In natural resources that will
attract capital to the development of
this section, provided the people of
Klamath have enough faith In their
iUWU VUUUIIf WW MU IU IU0 UB15WJT
ment. The proposed oregon-cauror-
nla and Eastern Railroad that will give
us a new outlet north and east Is only
an Indication of what is coming to
Klamath.
You might ask what has all thla to
do with city affairs and the coming
election. It haa jasf this much to do
