Closinf ! Diamond School
At the Diamond school April 22 nd,
one of ti e most successf ul schools of
this county was closed. -.There .was
cr.td ef about" 175. people-present
and although the.' school . house was L
sroah most of them were so situated
that thev could hear ' the' excellent
program rendered by pupils. ,A.t ten
o'clock the program began. . ltwas.a
lengthy program but from beginning
to ena it was of the deepest interest.
Several short plays were given -but
"Oor Lvsander" triad t.ha hit:' Tfe
play was well given andeaclf 'M the
cnaracters were well represented.
Neither must their songs be over-4-S8la:berger got . droves or the next

pmud of his chorus. At the close of
the morhinsr Drotrram their school
song of the teachers composition, was
given, inen, the ladies' from Dia
mond showed their was nothing lack
ingin their bountiful basket dinner
which was served - on tables outside
the sclioo lhouse
The most enteresting things of -the
afcernoon were the dual track meet
and the haste t ball game, both of
which were between Ogajlah , and
Diamond. The later winning -in
everything carried aay the. banners
Horace ' Wynn, the Diamond '.star,
came out first in the broad-iumn
hierh iumnand shot nnr. also ' he de
serves much credit for his running in
the relav. Mr. KeHncir had two rirls
and one boy in the race and Diamond
had three boys. Mr. Keuoe-g's cirls
surely had speed but when it was up
to Horace to win or lose -he showed
he was a sure enouirl) "diamond
The basket ball game was the kind
all of us like to see. Although the
Ogaliah boys played a hard clean
game Diamond came out ahead with
tue score or iz to z. it was an ex
cellent game and each player proved
himself a true sportsman. Everyone
there enjoyed himself to the utmost
and felt they, were well paid for hav
ing come. . .
Much credit is due :Mr.- Kirbv for
it took much work and drill ttF et
up- such a good program as ihe school
rendered; - It is i pleasure to . Mr.
