An argument being used In favor
of the appiopilatlon is that millions of
dollars aie being expended for nation
al preparedness, which will drnw
most heavily on the metals to mnke

ca are being worked to their limit, so
that ir the supply Is to bo increased
tho nation must depend on opening
now districts.
American Fork Canyon Is tho best
dlhtrlct in 1'tah that has not had an
exhaustive survey to assist in locating
the ore bodies. Such a survey as Is
being asketl for would undoubtedly
be the means of hastening the open
ing of new properties.
Preparedness calls for munition

Charles Doollttle. the Salt Lake
milling man. made a tilp up the
canyon Sunday with Peter Miller
ninnuger of tho Pacific mine. Mr
Doollttle. who Is a heavy owner in
the leasing company was delighted
with the showing of ore that has been
broken down ready for shipment or
been blocked out ready for extrac
tion soon as the ore teams commence
drawing from thu ore bins that are
filled and running over.
When asked about the property, Mr.
i -oolfttlo said that the Pacific Is one
of the big mines of the state, and he
roic the summer Is over, will he rated
among the topnotchers. "Aineilcan
Fork Canyon." he declared, "Is one or
the best milling districts in tho state,

iWORK STARTS ON
DEER CREEK PROPERTY
Mercer and Koiiudy. owners of a
big group of claims that surrounds
tho Inter-Hlato mine on three sides,
started a force of men to work on the
Deer Creek side and just below the
Inter-State. They have a fine cop
per showing between a lime shale
contact, extending for a long distance,
which will be opened up with a deep
tunnel. They also have a promising
deposit of molybdenum which will be
prospected, and If the work gets re
sults, It will be developed extensively.
Their holdings extend from tho bot
tom of Deer Creek, way up the moun
tain nbove Silver Lake Flat.
