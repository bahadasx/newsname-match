When I -resigned as Parish Farm

December, I did -so with regreat. I
disliked very. much to give up the
work I as .so .much. interestel in
and in leaving my many friends who
were also interested In better farm

would ever entertain the idea of
iolding the positionaagain, but I am

It is my desire to please every

Kidnapping of Child by Gypsies Causes
Excitement in Covington, But Exam
ination of Camp .GivesNo Clew.
Child Was Stolen From Parents in. Pennsylvania, and Is
Reported To Be In Possession of Gypsies Traveling In
Five Automobiles From Hattiesburg. Gypsies Arriving
Here Had No Boy With Them Bearing Marks Described
Simultaneous with the arrival of
a band of.gypsies-inCovington, Tues
day, the New Orleans papere publish
ed a story of a stolen child suppos
ed to be in possession of gypsies who
passed through lattiesburg a few
days earlier. It- istated that the
gypsies were traveling. in five auto
mobiles. The gypsies who. camped
at Goodbee brIidge-.near Covington,
also had autos, but there wereoseven
instead of tve ad also two .wagons.
One of these autos, an. Overlan ,
was sold to Mr.-Bascle.for $620. It
was an old ear.
Marshal Schultz, of Covington,
took the matter up mad started an in
vestigation, feeling that. possibly
these gypsies .might be the same band
that had stolen the child- (Henry
Glass) from Pike -County, .Jennsyl
vania. In the. meantime he "eceiv
ed the following- letter form Asslst

Baton Rouge, Ia., April 46, 1916:
Mr. Herman Schultz Covington, La.
Dear Sir:--I notice in this -morn

ed the band of gypiles who-were sup
po'sed to have kidnapped Heary Glass
from Pike County, Pen~sylvania, the
four year old lad who disappeared
from there moreethan a-.year ago.
This band. of -gppsies int five auto

impossible to give too much time to
any one neighborhood, for there are
too many neighborhoods in the par
ish.
Some people do not know what to
expect of the Demonstrator. They
think that he is to stand and walt
for each little call to go out some
where, and go when told, regardless
of conditions.' This Is not true. The
real object of the demonstration
work is to take as many farmers in
each ward, say six, and let these
farmers prepare their land, fertilize
it, drain it according to instructions;
also to use seed and implements with
which to carry out the plan of culti
'vation. -Seed selection will also be
done on these farms, and any other
Three of the. cars did not, stop but
hurried past..
I do not know that this will aid
you in any way, except to trace their
round about route through the coun
try, and to establish the fact that
they did not obtain the automobiles
at Hattiesburg, Miss. I think this
band of gypsies should be watched
very closely.
Yours very truly,

While the first visit to the camp
had not resulted in anything that
would justify the arrest of amy of
the party, this letter awakened fur
ther suspicion and the investigation
was renewed with the hope that some
new clew -migth be unearthed. Mar

scription of the chlid and received
the following answer from Mrs.
