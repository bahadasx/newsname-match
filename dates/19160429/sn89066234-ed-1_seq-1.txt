When I sew the nboxe in the

Inst fall, Mrs. Merchant had bee"
oondemned toti:e asylum. A doe
tor or two from llfmo appeared I
before tlie coumy court ami re
ported that she was violently to
ll ne.
At the time 1 wondered wh.v
Mrs Merchant was not brought
before the court, However, she
Avns sentence"! to the as.vluni as a
county charge. Hut the court
discovered that her husband was
receiving $lo0 per month as train
dispatcher, and that, therefore, he
should bear the expense, and the
-older admitting her as n county
patient was withdrawn, Mm
Merchant was not sent up,
After a night or two in lilino
jail, Mrs. Merchant wae brought
here Friday and locked up, DllP
inir tlie nisht she became hysteri
cal and kept tlie neighbors awake
Next morning the county court
judges were assembling to again
pass on her sanity, i noticed Dr
llnw and Judges Bowman and
Tomlinson in earnest conversation
in the court Jinll. The peopl
were gathering for the graduat
ing exercises.
Presently Dr. Haw said to me:
"tkm't you think it is a shame to
k .'j a woman in jail who ha
committed no offense? I have j ist
been over talking to her and 1
can discover nothing wrong with
her. she admits becoming hyster
ical at times, but she talks with
as good sense as anybody."
A little later the court judges
went to the Jail and I followed
Here was this frail woman sur
rounded by sheet steel and Iron
bars. She weighs about 00
pounds, is about 3r years old and
is the mother of two children
She looked fatigued and worn
It was her fourth day in captiv it.v
But she faced us as but few wo
men could and told her story tlie
substance of which was that
there was another woman In the
case and that her husband was
trying to get rid of her by send
ing her to the asylum, she said.
Judges Tomlinson and Bowman
left the jnil feeling very Indignant
They believed the woman's story
and did not believe her insane
At any rate that was the impresj
sion their conversation left on me.
I had expressed no opinion, We
had reached the crossing in front
vif the Kicker office. Feelirn eure
that the court's mind was made
up to release the woman. 1 ven
tured, there is not a woman in
this community, nor in any other
A'ho could tell a strnlghter story
than she told after going through
with what she has In the past
four days, Toward the close her
story was somewhat disconnect
ed. Judges Tomlinson and Bowman
agreed,
"He wants to put the cost on
the county.'' put in Judge Thorn
is. who seemed to be considering
the matter from a business view
point.
After noon I met Sheriff Ellis
and asked him what the court did
about the woman. "I don't know,
but I think they decided to send
her up," he answered.
I went into tlie court PO m and
found Clerk Pearman verj busy
writing an order. I stepped up
and asked Judge Bowman what
court had done about the woman.
We are making the order now
to send her to the asylum We
tried to Spt doctors to examine as
to her sanity, but failed, and we
thought the best thing to do was
to send lier up for a while."
Hence for tie second time, Mrs,
Merchant issenteneed t.vthe asy-
linn without a jury passing on
her sanity or a hearing In court
of any kind. After court adjourn
ed I asked cierk Pearman how
this was possible, He said two
lllmo physicians had certified to
her Insanity, and that the law
provided that the court could net
on the recommendations of doc
tors." "Yea," said l. "when the couri
appoint! the doctors ; but not
when they are appointed or selected
by somebody else."
Well, the court did try to have
her examined by physicians here,"
said Clerk Pearman as he turned
to tlie record and read an'order
made before noon instructing the
sheriff to summons Dr. Cannon, of
Fornfelt, who was here attending
the graduating exercises, and Drs.
Wade and Haw of Henton. "Hut
Sheriff Ellis reported that he
could not find them," continued
the Clerk.
Whether or not Mrs Merchant
is insane IUfr not know. Hut I
do know she did not appear that
way to me. And there is good
reason to benev c that if she is not
insane, she will be by the time
"the law" geis through with her.
Sunday she was taken to Farm
iugtou asylum as a county patient

THE RAILROADS.
Cleveland, Ohio. April 24.
Any advance in operating costs
of the railroads have not been due
to added outlays to transporta
tion employes. Train and engine
crews have given to the transpor
tation more than they have re
ceived in Increased rates of pa,
This fact is clearly shown by tlr
reports of the radio ids them
selves to their stock-holders nn .:
to the interstate Commerce Com
mission, Although engineers, fire
men .conductors and trainmen
have received sonje advances in
rales of pay during recent years,
they hove had to work harder.
and have handled move traffic
each year for each dollar of ad
ditional compensation received,
Transportation employes are
piece-workers. They are engaged
In handling freight and passenger
traffic, 'i
re piirencnt for a
standard day's work is to haul so
many tons of freight or so many
passengers 100 miles. If the
weight of a freight train is in
creased tlie cost to the railroads
for labor in handling each ton of
freight 100 miles is less.
Th econstant increasing of train
loads has been the predominant
factor in recent railway Operat
ing progress. The growth in
weight of trnins has been more
rapid than hr' advance in fate
of pa,i to transportation employ
es. Engine and train crewi have
trans; or:. ited proportionately a
greater volumn of freight than
they have received Increases In
aages, sa consequence, the la
bor cost to the railroads of engine
anil train crews lias decreased
During the course of the recent
.uliitrat inn between the western
railroads and their engineers and
firemen, it is shown that the pro
portion of total operating expen
ses arising from payments to the
transportation employes was 14
per cent less in 1 1 1 3 than in 1890.
Chicago. Apr, 22. W. , Lee,
pres., lent Brotherhood of Railway
trainmen, notified the 160.000
members that the four brother
hoods are not contemplating ar
bitration of their demands for an
8-hour da, The ultimatum In d
circular let.er sent out b.v Pr s
Lee to all lodges follows!
"Our members should disregard
all public statements to the ef
fect that arbitration Is being con
sidered by either of the organisa
tions parties to this movement
"It is evident from press reports
that have been published that
some interest is endeavoring to
cause the public and our member
ship to believe that arbitration
will be accepted, Nothing of this
kind is contemplated."
VILLA RESURRECTED
To report Villa dead was a
monumental blunder of the Asso
ciated liars, and it did not take
tiiein long to discover this So
they began to resurrect him the
very next day. And at this time
they have him "officially" alive.
It was a grievous blunder to
report Villa so awfully dead. Ho
had died of gangrene and had
been In his grave over a week.
Now that Is pretty tolerabl.v dead
They even found the woman who
bad nursed Villa In his last Illness
and when they took the corpse
from the grave, there was the
swollen leg and split pant leg,
Everything dove-tailed and ila
W as s ire dead.
But they eoul In't afford to l ve
htm dea i. The clumsey liar
seemed to overlook the fact that
with v uia out or me way tuere
would be no excuse for our troop
remaining In Mexico, Hence we
put In last week in shooting presi
dential notes ;ui i hot air at Ger
many in rder to give Villa time
to recov er.
The pn ss reports that had Villa
so dead also said he was contin
ually cursing the Americans, The
loud pedal was put on this. The
purpose was to offset the grow
ing belief that Villa is the tool of
American Interests In Mexico, and
that the Columbus raid was di
rected from this side of the border

among the poorest it is 27 In a

TIicsl conclusions have been am

THE PRESS ASSOCIATION,
The Southeast Missouri Press
Association meets at DeSoto this
week. What they meet for I do
not know, and I am sure not one
of its members could tell All
other organizations and associa
tions have a definite purpuse in
view, but the press association
it Just meets.
Some 1" years ago I joined til
association and attended tWn
meetings, i was the only member
who did not ride on a free pas
furnished by tlin railroads.
After two meetings and two nt
temps to find out what they were
trying to do, I njuti. l could dis
cover nothing In it for the mem

A few of the fraternity have in
sisted mat I join. Invariably I
put the question. "What for?"
And as invariably they can give
no reason, except to "get out m to 1
get acquainted. If any of them
can give any material reason for
the exis,ance of the association. I
should like to hear It.

"ilo to church Sunday."
These are the slogans he must

Last fall I visited a near-by cltj
on a Sunday and stepped Into a
newspaper office that was mak
ing a special "uo to church Sun
day" campaign. I found the
presses running and the employe
working the same as on a week
day.
After shaking hands with one of
the proprietors I asked. "What
d.x sail this mean presses run
ning, everybody at work'.' I ex
pected you would be at church. 1
see you are urging everybody else
to go."
The man smiled blandly as he
answered, "Oh. we have a repre

The Kicker prints what other
papers must suppress or move.
THE u II v ' :-' IT 1
The is B little matter that the
friends of the Kicker ought to
understand, and I am going to
tell tltein nbout it.
No doubt many of you have
wondered why so Very few of
the candidates announce in the
Kicker. I will tell you.
While there are ma to people In
Scott county who BELOX0 to
the Democrat e party, in the name
sens as a m tie belongs to Its
owner, the l)emocratlc part.i it
self is made up of the landlord
and banking interests of the coun
ty, und "t he church."
When the boycott was put on
the Kicker six years ago, these
interests made it Very plain to
the candidates that thej would
not support any man who placed
his announcement In the Kicker
Now. the Kicker cares nothing
about th:s. for it does not "bleed"
tlie candidates. I charge only for
the advertising space, and no
slobber goes No crook can
come in here and have me write
him up as "eminently qualified
for the office" just because he
has the price, My reason for teil-
inir you this is so you can "spot"
I the fellow who tellS J'OU he is
I free of ring influence
Many of the candidates are oft
en Rubes in politics, In an Indl
I reet way these are led to believe
thai their chances ,, ,i but
that they must avoid the Kicker

so doing they will be supported
by the "better class.''

said. "1 am coming over next

"All right." said I But he nevet
I came. Evidently his nerve failed
j him.
The Kicker has more reliable
I friends and readers in the count.v
j than any other paper. But they
are not of the "better class."
They are just common work ieo-
pie. But they vote. And when
one of these duck
one ot these aucKs come around
asking for your vote and plead
ing that he does not BELONG to
the ring, ask him wh.v his an
nouncement apjiears in the ring
organs, but not In the Kicker'.'
Then watch him sputter.
Kicker readers are not all So
cialists by any mean Many of
them are old party voters who
are tired of corrupt ring rule
The candidate who has no more
back-bone than to let the ring
sters dictate In what papers he
shall announce may be depended
on to be an humble servant of the
