Although Jerome only recent
cently completed a tine large

have made it evident that an

to be provided in the near
future.
Late last-week, party of gyp

through admitting that business
was good.
B. J. McKinney, a well known

The Arizona State prison at
Florence is undoubtedly a model
institution of its kind. No one
can visit the place without being
impressed by the efficiency of its
management in every depart
ment. Without resorting to the
severe methods employed in
some of the penal institutions of
the country the discipline is al
most perfect. Superintendent
S'mms has the high cost of liv
ing beaten to a frazzel when it
comes to feeding his wards, for
they are given three wholesome
and sustantial meals a . day,
which include fresh meat, veget
ables, fruits, bread, tea and coffee
at an average cost of about fif
teen cents per capita per day.
The sanitary conditions are
good and everything in an about
the place is as neat and clean as
a new pin. The grounds within
the grim walls are dotted with
green laws, rose and others flow
ering shrubs and bushes and
beds of beautiful flowers.
To big, kindly, efficient Robert
Simms, superintendent of the
institution, is due the lion's
share of the credit for this high
ly satisfactory and desirable con
dition of affairs at the prison.

Sid Simpson Is Appointed Ranger.
Sid Simpson, slayer of the
Mexican bandit Noriega at No
gales, Arizona, recently, has
been appointed a county ranger
by Sheriff Forbes. His appoint
ment was confirmed by the coun
ty board of supervisors at their
meeting this morning.
Simpson has been a deputy in
Santa Cruz county for some
time, and is widely known along
the border. Some time ago, while
in the Altar district in Mexico,
he with two other Americans
were taken prisoners by a
gang of bandits led by Noriega.
His companions were held as
hostages by members of the
gang, while Noriega and Simp
son proceeded to Nogales, Ariz
ona, where Simpson was to pro
cure money for the ransom of
the men. Instead of obtaining
the money, Simpson procured a
gun and returning shot the Mex
ican to death, empying his gun
into the bandit's body. He was
exonerated by a coroner's jury.
Simpson, it is said, was recom
mended as county ranger by

The Sheehy brothers are re

The ore from this property is

Pete will be married before re

Machinery arrived in Pata
gonia this week for the Du-

changing the present mill to an
electrical operated plant. The
big ore truck and the freight
wagon of C. B. Wilson, built es
pecially for extra heavy loads,
were used in hauling the ma
chinery back to the mine from
this station.
James Cunningham, familiarly
known to his many friends as
"Muldoon," was in town this

C. B. Wilson of Patagonia bond
ed a short time ago to Tucson
men. He reports that Engineer
Kempher, now in charge of the
property, is sinking a vertical
shaft and preparing to put in a
steam hoist.
THE THREE R MINE.
Famous Santa Cruz County Property
to Resume Operations.
By an arrangement made in
Tucson Tuesday of this week
between the litigants of the
Three R mine, that property is
to be started up again at once,
or by the first of next month.
Harry Harrison and son, two
well known mining men who
have been operating near Mon
terrey, in the State of Nuevo
Mexico, and who recently dis
posed of their entire holdings
there, will have control of the
Three R. Details of the agree
ment are not given out for pub
lication, but it is authoritatively
stated work is to be commenced
at once, says the Patagonian.
The Three R. mine is Patago
nia's one best bet. It has been
closed down for nsarly two
years on account of litigation.
N. L. Amster, president of the
Rock Island railroad and of the
Shannon Copper company, pur
chased the Three R. a few years
ago and took out over (500,000
worth of ore within a compara
tively few months. It is reliably
estimated that the mine has pro
duced three quarters of a million
dollars in ore in the short time
it has been operated. At the
time of its principal operation
copper was selling at 12 and 14
cents.
Ore from the Three R. is a
high-grade chalcocite, and is
perhaps one of the richest bodies
in the state, certainly the great
est in Santa Crnz county. Only
the high grade has been worked,
as there is no concentrator or
plani of any kind on the ground
for treating the low grade ore.
Enormous bodies of shipping ore
are said to be in sight, practi
cally blocked out, while it has
been estimated there are about
a hundred thousand tons of low
grade ore, averaging between 2
and 0 per cent, ready to be put
through a mill. At the present
price of copper, and from its
past record as a money maker,
the Three R. mine today is pro
bably a million dollar proposition
The principal owner of the
Three R. is Col. R, K Richard
son of Patagonia.
Western Oil Wins on Duncan Hill.
"One of the most signilicant
features connected with the sen
sational Duncan street hill climb
ing contest pulled oft in San
Francisco recently, and the feat
ure that probably means most to
Pacific Coast motorists, said Mr.
J. E. Balsley, District Sales
Manager of the Standard Oil
Company, is the fact that, with
few exceptions, the cars that
successfully negotiated that now
famous fifty per cent grade, had
their crank cases filled with oil
made from western asphalt-base
crude."
"Every prospective car buyer
in that neck of the woods had
his eye on the machines that
went out to conquer Duncan
Hill. And no one was more
awake to that fact than were the
motor car dealers themselves.
"So, when they saw to it that
their test cars were filled with
Western Oil, there was a great
deal more back of it than any
mere feeling of loyalty to home
industry. One dealer is report
ed as having said 'any inferior
oil would have proved disas
trous.' Evidently most of them
considered western oil as the
best bet."
