FIGHT!
The patrons of the Tacorua-Se
attle steamers are going to have
their side presented when the
heuring on the proposed rate in
crease takes place.
The editorial in yesterday's
Times urging that the unor
ganized pansengers bo given an
efficeint spokesman was followed
today by announcements that
make certain the public's side
will be cupably represented.
The Central Labor Council will
take up the fight, and It is likely
the Commercial Club will also.
In a letter to the editor today,
Rea Last, secretary of the Labor
Council, says:
Takes simt at Green.
"Very much plensed with your
article on the raising of rates on
the Seattle run.
'We are of tlie opinion that if
Mr. Green inn his business legiti
mately and did not waste large
sums of money trying to run oth
er fair companies off other
routes where there is no reason
on earth for operating them ex
cept to create a monopoly, and
also lavishly spending good coin
to ship Mississippi negroes out
here to break the strike of the
Bteamshipmen, there would be no
need for a raise In rates.
"The Central Labor Councils of
Seattle and iiere are joining in a
demand to the public sen-ice com
mission that a public hearing be
held, and we feel confident that
we can show that there is no
necessity in raising the rates."
I'll to Club Tuesday.
Action by the Commercial Club
will be threshed out before the
board of directors Jiext Tuesday,
it was announced today by Chair
man S. M. Collins of the transpor
tationn bureau.
"I have appointed a special
committee to take the bureau's
expression before the board."
Collins said today. "I have not
acquainted the men with their
appointments y*t, no would rather
not give them to the public at this
time.
"The situation will be to in
vestigate thoroughly and if the
board fees fit to instruct our
bureau to go ahead with any
definite action we will do ho,
but at prestnt we are without
Instructions."

The people of Berlin thought
that the memorandum was a new

that America is helping England.
Wilson's statement that an
armed ship should be deemed
peaceful until conclusive «vk
denee wag shown to the contrary,
caused this comment:
"If I walk down the street

Wilson to know whether my in
