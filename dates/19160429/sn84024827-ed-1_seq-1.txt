Blttbough confidence is felt that the;

It is reported from Belfast that the
postoffice has been recaptured, but the
report lias not yet been confirmed
from any other quarter. From Belfast
also co-res the official reports stating
that Liberty Hall had been eaptutred
by a gunboat in the river and that the

parts o fthe city.
The British papers print lon dis
patches and show the strongest inter

behind the movement. They also
publish the admission by the Cologne

VIOLENCE IN DUBLIN.
DUBLIN, Tuesday, April 25, Via
London, April 2. Dublin now has
been held up for 24 hours by the fol
lowers of James Larkin, head of the
Sinn Fein.
There hs been some violence in
the cXy as marked the big street car
"Tike in which was headed by
Larkin, but supplemented by the use
of an armed force with military pre
tensions an dthe seizure 'of strategic
points designed to give the disturb
ance the aspect of a revoluttion.
The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, in a
proclamation' today, calls the move
ment, 'insurrectionary' 'and declares
that it Is due to foreign promptings.
It is, he says, "small." He adds that
"stern measures are being taken to
suppress it." 1
"The military operations for the
suppression o fthe rebellion in Dub
lin are satisfactory, "says a communi
cation issued by Keld Marshall
Clench, commanding the Home forces,
lute last night.

is, which was held by political riot

riots in Sydney. While it is declared
not to have the support of the people
generally and even is not considered
by some of the eulhtorities, a rising,
the situation certainly is virtually ser
ious, and far beyond the dimensions
o fa revolt. The trouble has gone on
now for 24 hours and has completely
destroyed the life of Dublin. No shops
are open and no busines sis being
transacted. Street cars have ceased
to run and th g?s supply is cut off.
Use of the troops between the city and
end the suburbs has been forbidden
by the military and the running of j
trains to and from the country is very i
irregular.

AMERICAN JURISTS DENOUNCE
GERMAN SUBMARINE POLICY

WASHINGTON. April 29. Subma

Prof. Reeves declared it was out

the administration for an alleged
