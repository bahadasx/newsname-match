THE RIOHT PLACE AT LAST.
(The eIrlcianas of Course.
A Northern poet, who came South
on a prospeeting trip, was moved to
verse by the advatags, beauty and
climate, and here is what he wrote.
under the caption. "The Right Place
at Last":
Well, wife. I've found the promised
land,
I hove in here today.
Slid from an iceberg, rthe snow,
Kerplunk. into middle of May.
I've always hesitated some
A handln' out my hand
To any of those blamed crack shots
Of Lee and Jackson's bend;
Thought they wus slow an' leay like,
An' oflIsh, an' sum proud.
( Pact Is in '93 they wuas
A darn peetirrous crowd I
sut, pehaw. the welcome that I got
Was so spontan'yous that
It knocked my old-time prejudice
into a small cocked hat.
The land's Jee' like a picture book
Held up before your eye.
You'd think the trainman set you off
Right smack In Paradise.
There's great bll palms a settin' round,
(They must come seand'lous low),
An' bowers an' orange trees an' things
That make. a scrumptious show.
The homes are not big palees,
Lke castles on the Rhine,
Rut, by Heek, they've got comfort writ
All over every line.
I saw big ields of garden ses
All green, row after row,
And couldn't think that beck at home
Right now you're saovelln' snow.
And when the stars peeped out last
night.
And the soothin' seouth wind blew.
All that It lached of the Garda of Edeu
Was that I didn't have you.
Now, wife, 'll tell you what I've dose:
I Ã½je' made up my mind,
That this land's good enough for us.
The portiest spot we'll and.
I bought a lot this afternoon
(The others all bought, too.)
An' give my orders for a house
Jee' right for me and you.
So pack the things an' come on down,
Per goodness sake, be spry;
I'm thawed out now an' gettin' young.
Up there I'd treese and die.
You know our ree@ will soon be run,
We've faced the storms together;
The balance of our trip we'll have
Pair skine and summer weather.

gtlTER bAOlS.
(Walter Parker, Se.Treas., Jefferson
Highway Association, New Orleans.)
Now that the strenuous political
campaign has passed into history, pro
ponents of good roads In Louisitan are
looking forward to definlte action on
the part of the new State Legislature.
"Better Roade" should be the slogan of
the people of Louisiana, united in a
desire to have the great Jefferson High
way completed as early as possible.
Consnetlng New Orleans on the
South with Winnipeg on the North, the
Jelerson Highway promisee to be one
of the greatest transportation agencles
In the United States. Running practl
eatly through the center of Lousiana,
it will aford means of vehicular travel
for every resident of the State By
means of connecting highways, one of
the best good roads systems In the
United States can be built up.
J. D. Clarton. general manager of
the Jefferson Highway, Is expected to
come to Louisiana soon. Mr Clarkeon
has been touring the states north of
loulsiana, and has found nothing but
interest and enthusiasm In the project
In several Instancee, hundreds of miles
of the highway already have been com
.ileted, and the gap between New;
O(rleans and Winnipeg is rapidly being
shortened,
Aware of the manifold benefits that
will be conferred upon this section by
the building of the Jefferson Highway.
the people of Louisiana should urge
their legislators to assist in furthering
the meritorous project. Good roads
have become a positive seceesity, sad
the day has arrived for LeouslIan to
come to the fore.
