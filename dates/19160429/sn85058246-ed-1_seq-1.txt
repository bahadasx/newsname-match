SUPER-SIX
SOLVES MOTOR
PROBLEM
Tho Super Six has been given tho
severest kind of tests all over tho
country. It has demonstrated endur
anco and resorvo power sulllclent to
climb tho steepest hills and negoti
ate with ease tho worst roads It Is
possible to oncountor In ordinary
touring.
Reservo power Is necessary for
constantly arising emergencies. In
tho Super-Six this reserve power Is
economical. Tho cur dovolops as
much power with n half open throt
tlo as tho average motor develops
when pulling undor n full load, Thl:
Is because tho Super Six Is nlniost
twlco as powerful, Tho harder nny
motor works tho more attention It
voqulrcg and the Bhorter lta llfo. Tho
Super Six with Us patented compen
sated crankshaft, Is so smooth run
ning nnd vlbratlonless that thero Is
nono of the usual wear and tear on
tho motor. This means lower cot
for upkeep, loss wear on tho tires.
It Is only necessary for the Super
Six to work at half or less of Its
power capacity most of thd time,
Yet tho Supor Six la capablo of ex
erting abnormal powor In nny omor
goncy. This now motor, with such
reserve power, using less than half
of It except in ensos of emergency,
solves tho problom of economical
maintenance. Adv.. 4
