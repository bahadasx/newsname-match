V. S. Officials Will Propose
That Mexican Govern

WASHINGTON'. April 28. On the
eve of the conference at Juarez
between General Obregon, Carransta's
war minister, utid Generals Scott and
Funston, representing the United
States, it became known here tonight
that the American officers havo been
instructed to attempt to work out in
detail military plans for the Co-operation
of the Mexican and American
troops in dispersing bandit bands, in
cluding a dlvisioB of northern Mexicf
into spheres of activity for the two
forces.
iCenerally speaking the aim of Generals-
Scott and Kunston will be to
secure the consent of General Obre
gon to the employment of the Ameri
can troops In the territory Immediate
ly south of the border and to the or
ganization of the Mexican forces along
definite lines in order that all of
northern Mexico may be scoured thor.
oughly for Villa and other outlaws.
Xot Satisfied
'"General Obregon will be told that
the United States is not yet satisfied
that American border towns will be
free from other raids similar to that
on Columbus If the American troops
are withdrawn. He will be assured,
however, that the troops will be with
drawn Just as soon as there are rea
sonable grounds for such a belief. He
wlil be told that the sooner the Mexl
w troopB give complete co-opera-"
tlon. the sooner the troops will ac
complish this object.
The Mexican question. Including the
instructions to Generals Scott and
Funston. were gone over fully at to
day's cabinet meeting, the first held

KAISER WILHELM
AND GERARD CONFER
Believe German Head
Means to Explain Fully,
His Views.
WON'T PRESS REPLY
Dispatches From Germany
to Effect That U. S. De
mands Will Be Met.
WXSHINCTON. April 28. Am
bassador Gerard at Berlin, in
advising the state department today
that he had been invited to confer
with Emperor William at at my head
quarters, said he had not been In
formed of the purpose of the confer
ence. In fact, Secretary J-anslng said,
w lion announcing the receipt of Mr.
Gerard's dispatch, no explanation of
any kind had. accompanied the invi
tation. The belief prevails here, however,
that the emperor desires to dls. uss the
general submarine subject with Am
bassador Gerard and possibly explain
In detail his views for the benefit of
President Wilson. Diplomats, espe
cially those attached to Teutonic em
bassies, seemed to regard the confer
ence between the emperor and the
ambassador as holding a certain de
gree of hopefulness.
llcu-s M.itter.
Urief consideration was given the
saiuarine issue at today's cabinet
meeting, tho first held In a week, but
Secretary Lansing was able to give
only the most meager informa'lon on
the' subject. In view ol the activity ot
German government officiuls and
their apparent intention to reach a de
cision as quickly ns possible, the pres
ident is disposed not in Instruct Am
bassador Gerard to press tor a. reply
to the American demand at once. The
querlion will not be allowed to drag
along many more oays, nowever, u
was said today.
The attack by a submarine on the
British merchantman Industry report
ed today and the placing of the crew
in open boats 120 miles from shore
created an unfavorable impression on
officials, although there were no
Americans on board and therefore the
United States is not directly con
cerned. Germany has admitted that
it Is only proper to place passengers
and crews of attacked vessels In open
boats when they are near shore and
the weather is good.
All Optimistic.
Optimism regarding the ultimate
outcome of the situation was appar
ent in German circles following the
receipt by the German embassy of
dispatches from Berlin described as
indicating that Germany would at
tempt to meet the American demands.
Because of the visit of Mr. Gerard
to the emperor, officials seemed in
clined tonight to believe It would be
impossible for Germany to make re
ply to the American note until early
next week.

10:15 a.m.) Dublin now has been

tion of members of the Sinn Fein so
ciety and followers of James Lai kin,
head of the transport workers' union
and well known as a strike leader.
There hits bean the Mine violence
In the city as marked the big street
car strike in 1913, which was headed
by Lurkin, but supplemented by the
use of an armed force with military
pretensions and the seizure of
strategic points dosigncd to give the
disturbance the aspect of a revolution.
The lord lieutenant of Ireland, in
a prociuifiiiiiuu iuuu.v, tans mo iii U,G

that It is due to foreign prompting.
It Is, ho says, "small." He adds that

The revolution thus far is consider
ed an imitation though on a much ex.

Taris, which was held by polltiral
rioters some 15 years ago and the
riots In Sydney street in London.
While It is declared not to have the
support of the people generally and
even is not considered by some of the
authorities a rising, the situation is
certainly very serious and far beyond
the dimensions of a riot.
Dislocated Life.
The trouble has gone on now for 24
hours und has completely dislocated
the life of Dublin. No shops lire open
and no business is being transacted.
Street cars have ceased to run and the
gas supply has been cut off. I'so of
the telephone between the city and
the suburbs has been forbidden by the
military and the running of trains to

Fred Bissell Tells Revolting
Story of Killing of Edna
Dinsmore.
LANSING, Kan., April 28. Fred
Missel), a Topoka baker, confessed
late today that he murdered Edna
Dlnsmoro. a ten-year-old girl, in To
peka last Tuesday. Resentment caused
by the refusal of the child's mother
to marry him prompted the crime,
many of the details of which were of
a revolting character.
The story of the murder and the
happenings that precded it was told
to J. K. Codding, warden of the Kan
bus state penitentiary and L. L. Klene,
sheriff of Topeka. according to an
announcement made by Warden Cod
ding. Offers to Buy Books
Bissell, according to the statement,
met the child Tuesday morning. When
Edna complained that her mother
would not buy her the school books'
she wanted Bissell declared he said to
her:
"You go with me and I will get you
all the hooks you need."
Hi led the child to a vacant house.
As they walked along Bissell said he
began to think of how the child's
mother had repulsed his attentions
and had refused to marry him.

CHARRED BONES OF
A MAN ARE FOUND
Mystery Uncovered by Girl
Some Time Ago Is
Called to Mind.

SUSPECTED
Remains Discovered Yester
day on Pasture in Creek
County.
The second chjipter of one of tho
mysteries, which from time lo time
spread themselves before the peace
officers of a community, standing out
in bold relief against the day's routine
work, but never fathomed by the men
who spend their time In trying to pick
up here und there a clue which would
lead to a solution, was written yester
day when the charred bones of a
man were found in the smouldering
wake of a prairie fire near the Tulsa
Creek counies' line.
The first chapter of this mystery,
according o he sheriff's office, was
written some months ago when a girl
stooped beside a newly-made mound
of earth and uncovered, benath a
horse hide, tho bodies of two men,
apparently recently burled.
Heard a Shot.
As she gazed at the bodies a shot
rang out through the river bottom, on
the bank of which she had discovered
the grave, and a small twig of a wil
low tree, clipped from the larger
limb, dropped on the grave.
She started to flee from tho scene
when a man rushed from the under
brush and grabbed her by the arm.
She was held fast nnd the man, armed
with the gun, informed her that to
tell of the Becret she had discovered
would mean her death. She was then
led to the car line and placed aboard
a street car bound for the city, again
being warned that unless she re
mained silent she, too, would fall a
victim to the lone river bottom
bundit.
She told her story, however, and
several days later officials visited the
scene only to find the grave opened
and the bodies removed.
Got He-mains
YeBterday morning Sheriff Woolley
received a telephone cull from Sa
pulpa, Informing him that a skeleton
had been found by some men who
were burning a pssture and that it
was in Tulsa county, therefore out of
the Jurisdiction of the Creek county
authorities. Deputies McClain and
Reynolds were Immediately sent to
the scene and returned with the re
mains, or all that could be found. It
was discovered that one of the urms
was missing, as were several of the'
rib bones. ,
"It looks like It might be a part ,
of the plot that was unearthed sev- j
cral months ago by a girl who found
two bodies along the river bank, near I
the pump station," said Sheriff:
Woolley. "I expect that a further :
search in the pasture will disclose the1
other body." i
Hut for the skeleton found yester
day, the final chapter has been writ
ten. A coroner's Jury found that the
bones were those of an unknown man,
who met his death from means un
known to the Jury.

and not denied that the Sinclair oil
Refining company has purchused tha

the Southwestern Petroleum comnunv
with a daily production of 4.100 bar

Another piirchi'se of a duilv urn.

it became known that representatives
of the Sinclair Oil & Refining cor-

The new company held its first

It Is supposed also that the Toxo-

also put Its production in the new

generally credited with being true.

Several other properties have been

Sinclair will eventually take over tho

and may prove to be true before very
long.
Itig Dcul Closed.
Another denl involving $1,500,000
was closed yesterday when final pa
pers Were signed in tho sale of tho
F. II. I'fer stone Itluff properties to

Although this deal has been ru

however, will continue in the produc

Mr. Oulbruith formerly owned &

Mr. I'fer, realizing something like
$275,000 from oil sold and the price
puid for the property.
