At last, my husband got me a buttle ol
Cardui, the woman's tonic, and I com
menced taking it. From the very first
dose, I could tell it was helping me. I
can now walk two miles without its
tiring me, and am doing all my work."
If you are all run down from womanly
troubles, don't give up in despair. Try
Cardui, the woman's tonic. It has helped
more than a million women, In its 50
years of continuous success, and should
surely help you, too. Your druggist has
sold Cardui for years. He knows what
it will do. Ask him. He will recom
mend it. Begin taking Cardui today.
