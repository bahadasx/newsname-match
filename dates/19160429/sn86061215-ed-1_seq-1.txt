The third section of Gen. Obregon'a
train, hearing Gen. Luis Gutierrez,
ynilltary governor of Chihuahua state,
Was derailed south of Juarez and sev
eral passengers were reported in
jured. It is not known whether Gen.
Gutierrez was hurt.
Generals Scott and Funston are due
to reach here tonight when it Is ex
pected that arrangements will be
,ade for the first conference to be
leld in Juarez tomorrow.
,E
Has Full Powers.
General Obregon anticipated a sat
isfactory conference and it was Indi
cated that he was vested with plenary
powers by First Chief Carranza to ef
fect an adjustment of the military
situation along the Mexican border.
Preceding the special train of Gen
eral Obregon by an hour was a troop
strain sent in advance to protect Gen
eral Obregon'a party from a possible
surprise attack from roving bands of
(Villa bandits.
Obregon is Welcomed.
All Juarez turned out to make Gen
eral Obregon and his party welcome.
Troops lined both sides of Calle Com
ercio, from the railroad station to the
customs house, where Obregon and
his party were escorted. The Juarez
military band aided in the welcome
Elexicans
the railroad station where scores of
gathered to meet the min
ister of war.
General Gabriel Gaveria with his
staff, dressed in field uniforms, with
Andrew Garcia, Mexican consul to El
Paso, officially welcomed General
Obregon at the station.
The war minister wore his field uni
form of gray and a campaign hat of
broad brim. General Obregon has only
cine arm, his right arm having been
torn away by a Yilla shell at Celaya.
Asked what he woul do in case the
American troops were kept in Mexico,
.Gen. Obregon replied:
"That is a matter which we hope to
arrange in conference. I do not wish
to say anything about that as It might
be prejudicial to the success of the
conference."
Thinks Villa Wounded.
Gen. Obregon said that he thought
the de facto government had sufficient
troops to take care of Villa and his
bands without aid from the United
States.
"Gen. Obregon, do you think Villa
Is dead?"
"I do not believe Villa is dead," was
the reply, "but I am positive that he
)s wounded and suffers for lack of
jnedical attention and therefore has
Small chance to be personally active
Spain in any campaigns."
"Have you sufficient troops to cap
lure Villa?"
"Yes," answered Obregon. "That
Kill be easy. His bands are broken up
knd it is now only a question of hunt
ing one man. Villa with a few of his
followers, I believe, is near the bound
ary of £j|inaloa and Sonora."
Laughs at Reports.
Gen. Obregon laughed loudly when
isked about the report of friction be
tween the first chief and himself.

BIG LONDON PAPER ADVI8E3
QUICK ACTION WITH ARMY
THEN PER8UASION.
London, April 28. —Dealing with the
Irish situation, the Dally Chronicle
urges the government against the
adoption of too harsh measures, add
ing:
"The immediate military situation
ought not to present great difficulties.
It is not easy to understand how the
Sinn Feiners have been able to hold
out for days in Dublin. We -should
have thought that all military argu
ments would favor crushing the move
ment in the capital with the utmost
rapidity, for every day that it pro
tracts its resistance must add to the
risk of its finding Imitators elsewhere.
But, while strong military action must
be the first essential, we hope that
trials under martial law and the use of
the military for any but strictly mili
tary operations will be avoided as far
as possible.
"We hope, too, there will be a
prompt and honest Inquiry Into the
motives of the rebels and the best
means for bringing them back to their
senses. A commission composed of
acknowledged Irish leaders to assist in
dealing with the rebels and negotiate
their surrender might be of great ser
vice. Sir Edward Carson and John
Redmond are ready to cooperate in this
way. There is a place for mediation
as well as for repression."
ONEt MAN ARRESTED.
Philadelphia, Pa., April 28.—Govern
ment agents made known today that
they have under arrest H. B. Stilz,
formerly a draftsman at the Philadel
phia navy yard, who is accused' of
distributing a pamphlet attacking
President Wilson. Stilz, it is alleged
wrote a letter to President Wilson
several months ago of such a charac
ter as to cause the draftman's dlsmis
sal from the navy yard. It is alleged
he then began the distribution of the
pamphlet.
RISH-IMERIH
PAPERS ACCUSED
New York, April 28.—An investiga
tion was begun today at the office of
the United States district attorney to
determine whether a crime had been
committed by persons responsible for
attacks on President Wilson and the
national administration that have ap
peared in Irish-American papers pub
lished here since the outbreak of the
revolution in Dublin. CopieB of these
editorials will be examined, it was
said, by one of the assistant district
attorneys.
The attention of the federal author
ities was first aroused by an editorial
statement that information which led
to the sinking of the German ship
which attempted to land arms and
ammunition on Irish soil came from
a member of the Washington admin
istration "on the orders of President
Wilson." This declaration has been
authoritatively denied in Washington.

VENIZEL03 SAID TO 0PP08E THE
PLAN8 OF HI8 PARTY TO
STIR UP 8TRIPE.
Athens, Sunday, April 23.—( Delay
ed)—An impartial observer who has
just returned from a tour of all the
mainland of Greece reports an amaz
ing spread of sentiment in favor of
Ellptherios Venizelos, the former
premier, even in conservative Pelopon
nesus.
The recent efforts of the government
to suppress the demonstrations and
meetings of the Venizelos adherents
has awakened deep resentment
among the people and there is a grow
ing determination to oust the govern
ment even If it be necessary to re
sort to arms.
The Associated Press learns from In
contestable authority that several
leaders of the revolution of 1909 are
actively engaged In planning a slmiliar
attack, although Venizelos deprecates
this and advises Instead the use of
legal methods.
Frequent talks with King Constan
tino have convinced The Assoclted
Press correspondent that the monarch
wTigof
Inaction Is approved by a majority of
I the Greek people. The king persists
in regarding the recent demonstra
tions of the growing popularity of
Venizelos as mere political meneuvers.
The weakness of the opponents of
the former premier lies in the discon-
tent among the rank and file of the
army who largely attend the meeting
of the Venizelos followers and who are
openly dissatisfied and declare that a
purposeless mobilization is depriving
their families of their support.
Neutral observers who are in a posi
tion to judge declare that the present
situation can not last sixty days longer
and that unless an allied offensive
against Bulgaria relieves the tension
by sweeping the Greeks into war with
their ancient enemies, a political
cataclysm in Greece is inevitable. A
A most rigid triple censorship of all
press telegrams keeps the world gen-

Contact was made between the op

within two days. This engagement, it
seems likely, will involve possession
of Caplra pass, through which the at

According to Brig. Gen. Clarence
