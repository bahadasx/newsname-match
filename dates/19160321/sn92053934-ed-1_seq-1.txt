WORSTED IN BATTLE
Reports Claim Bandit Lead
er Was Badly Defeated
by Carranzistas.
Columbus, N. M., March
21, (by wireless from the
field army)- An aeroplane,
one of six to arrive today,
was partially wrecked in a
50-foot fall. The pilot, Lieu
tenant T. S. Bowen, was in
jured but not fatally.
Lieutenant Bowen sus
tained a broken nose and
other slight injuries. He was
attempting to take the air un
der difficulties. Several at
tempts of the aviators to fly
were frustrated previously
by the wind. Bowen went up
but when 50 feet in the air
his machine took a plunge
and dived almost to the
ground.
El Paso, March 1. Aviators of the
United States army were reported to-!
day searching the almost blind trails
leading to the passes In the Sierra
Madre mountains, where the bandit,
Villa, may attempt to escape after his
defeat by the Carranza torces yester
day at Namaquipa. Details of the fight,
in which Colonel Cauo with about nine
hundred Carranzaistas took part, are
Mill lacking but reports have it that
Villa was badly worsted and that he
fled, leaving his dead and wounded be
hind. Captain B. D. Foulois is in charge of
Hie seven birdmen selected for the task
of scouting for Villa who, after his fight
with Colon"! Cano is expected to scat
ter his bandits rather than risk an en-'
gagement with the American troops
who are said to be on their way to the
north.
Would Enjoy Ghinif "Goose Chase."
Mexicans here believe Villa will hide
in the mountains until the American
troops have given up the chase. Mex
ican consul Garcia in El Paso says
that Villa would enjoy nothing better
than to lead the American troops on a
wild chase into these mountains and
then laugh at their efforts to find him.
Await Reports of Battle.
Further news of the battle reported
late yesterday near Namiquipa be
tween Carranza troops and Villistas
was awaited along the border today. It
Villa ha3 been able to win victory here
the way is open for a flight into north
ern Chihuahua, or the bandit leader
can proceed eastward into the fast
nesses of the high ranges shutting in
the Namiquipa district.
News of the battle was received first
by General Gavira at Juarez. His dis
patches did not state tie number of
Villa men engaged but Colonel Cano,
commanding the Carranza troops, la
said to have had a force of 900.
Wireless dispatches said six biplanes
of the First Aero squadron, command
ed by Captain Benjamin D. Foulois,
had reached the American expedi
tionary forces. Henceforth aeroplane
scouting is expected here to play an
important part in the progress of Gen
eral Pershing's column. No uneasi
ness is felt regarding Lieutenant W.
G. Kilner, who left Columbus in a
seventh machine to go to the front
and did not arrive with the others. The
aero squadron undoubtedly followed
the line of communication established
by General Pershing in his southward
progress. If Lieutenant Kilner suf-

Des Moines, March 21. The state
Patrol board planned to hear argu

of Charles Thomas of Des Moines, who
for years has been known aa "Iowa's
Boat expensive murderer." Thomas

Will Accept
Double Plan
of Carranza
Washington, March 21. President
Wilson and his cabinet today decided
to accept a proposal for a protocol
between the United States and the de
facto government of Mexico for co
operation in the pursuit of General
Villa and his outlaws.
General Carranza's ambassador here
and state department officials will dis
cuss the protocol further. It is ex
pected it would be put in final form
in a few days and signed.
It also was decided at today's cabi
net meeting that word should be sent
to General Carranza that the request
of the United States to use the Mexi
can railroads does not include the
transportation of troops but only ship
ment of supplies to the American
troops in Mexico.
It was indicated that the proposed
protocol would be so comprehensive as
to include all questions which might
arise in connection with the joint pur
suit of Villa by the American and Car
ranza forces.
VINDICATION OF
LOB SOUGHT
Chicago, March 21. Attorney Al
bert Fink, closing his opening state-
j ment for the defense in the trial of
William Lonmer today gave his ver
sion of the formation of the "William
Lorimer Lumber company and ex
plained what he termed the "loose
form" in which transactions leading
up to it were handled by saying that
no one but Mr. Lorimer and his two
sons were interested in the concern.
Affidavit was made that the capital
stock was paid in by Lorimer's secre
taries who had made out checks for
the amount but it was not really paid,
he said.
The contention that this was done in
order to get more credit at the bank
is not justified, Fink said.
The attorney ended his argument
with an appeal for vindication. He
could have asked dismissal, he said, on
the ground that the statute of limi
tations had expired, but Mr. Lorimer
preferred to have vindication.
AURORA MAN DIES

who died here last night from typhus
fever after going into Mexico to com

tions prevent any other disposition.
Relatives will ask Washington, It is
understood, to set aside this regula
tion that the body may be sent to his
Illinois home.

their vigorous offensive against
the Germans and the battle north
east and northwest of Verdun be
tween the French and Germans

In an attack on the village of
Vaux, which i held y the Ger
mans, the French were driven
back after suffering big losses.
In Galicia, the Austrians and
Russians have again come to
gether and fighting has been
severe, though no Important gains
have been made by cither side.
The Italians and Austrians are

Rush to Aid.
San Antonio, March 21.
General Funston today ask
ed the war department for
additional troops to be used
in the campaign against
Villa. He did not state the
number, but explained he
wanted an adequate force of
infantry and cavalry to pro
tect the line of communica
tion, already more than 100
miles long. He received no
further news from General
Pershing.
Washington, March 21. Late
this afternoon the war department
had received no request for addi
tional troops from General Fun
ston. but officials said such a re
quest might be on the way.
Troops at various inland points
are ready to move to the border
at an hour's notice.
El Paso, Texas, March 21. Fran
cisco 'Villa and his band of outlaws
have been forced into another battle
with the Carranza troops near Las
Cruces. This information came as a
report by wireless today to the Uni
ted States army station at Columbus,
N. M., and it was said that American
troops had been despatched to Las
Cruces to aid in the fighting.
1 The fighting at Las Cruces follow
ing the engagement at Namaquipa
yesterday indicated that the Carran
za troops are pressing Villa hard in
his flight northward along the Santa
Maria river and that the outlaw may
soon be forced to stand and give bat
tle to the American troops now mov
ing southward.
The American and de facto govern
ment troops are drawing the cordon
closer around the elusive Villa and
within a few days army officers here
believe, there will be a series of run
ning fights.
The telegraph wires were cut some
where north of Casas Grandes today
and Carranza officials were without
details of the Namaquipa battle in
which Colonel Cuno whipped the out
law. Marion Letcher, the United States
consul at Chihuahua telephoned to
Consul Garcia at EI Paso today that
the reports about anti-American dem
onstrations in Chihuahua were all
false.
Within 24 hours after word is re
ceived that Mexican railways can be
utilized by the American troops, sup
plies could be rushed south to Gen
eral Pershing in huge quantities, as
General Bell has made every prepara
tion for quick loading. The Mexico
Northwestern is the road that would
be used. Speed in transportation is
expected because scores of American
engineers have volunteered to man the
trains.
Rout Villistas.
Torreon, Mex., March 21. Govern
ment troops have routed a band of Vil
listas at Trinidad, killing 18 men and
capturing 16 saddle horses. They pur
sued the bandits as far as Jimulco.
General Francisco Gonzales is await
ing further reinforcements which will
enable him to protect the railway
against raiders.
A party of Americans is leaving for
the border. A number of others are
preparing to return to the states if
they find conditions warrant. Railway
travel is still subject to many delays,
owing to defective rolling stock and
road beds. A train expected here to
day is stuck at Gomez Palacio.
Suspense Causes Worry.
San Antonio, March 21. Failure to
hear from General Pershing sharp
ened the interest of thoBe at General
Funston's headquarters today, but did
not arouse any anxiety. It was point
ed out that the cavalry detachmenLa
last night reported moving along three
trails south of Casas Grandes were out
of communication other than that
maintained by the men of the signal
corps and that General Pershing him
self probably would not receive the re
ports of those in command until after
considerable delay.

SUIT AGAINST TAPER
London, March 21. The '.ibel suit
of Mrs. Herbert Asquith. wife of the
premier, against the Globe was settled
today. The suit was brought on ac
count of publication by the Globe of
statements that Mrs. Asquith had vis
ited German prisoners of war and had
sent presents to them. When the case
was called announcement was made
that the Globe had consented to judg
ment for $5,000 and costs.
The defendants made an unreserved
public apology for the statements in
the Globe.
Mrs. Asquith went into the box and

WAGE RAISE GIVEN
RAILWAY EMPLOYES
Des Moines, la., March 21. Terms
of an agreement between officials and
employes of the Des Moines City Rail
way company by which increased
wages are granted employes was made
public today.
The increases, according to the
statement given out by the company,
will affect all employes and will
amount to $25,000 this year, $50,000
next year and $75,000 in 1918.
Barnmen and men employed in the
power houses are also benefited by
the raise.
A feature of the negotiations, it was
said, was the insistence of union offi
cials that the wages of women em
ployed to wash car windows be raised.
This was granted and women, who up
to this time have received $1.50 a day,
hereafter will draw $2.30.

Great Power
in Army Bill
Washington, March 21. The house
today continued work on the Hay
army reorganization bill with about
two-thirds of the measure remaining
to be disposed of. Among the sec
tions awaiting consideration were
those relating to the national guard,
the industrial reserve, and that pro
viding for a nitrate plant.
The first action of the house today
was to adopt without a debate an
amendment to give the president ab
solute control over the reserve of 60,
000 men.
The amendment is the most impor
tant addition to the bill yet made. As
the measure now stands the president
would have authority, without con
sulting congress, to increase the army
from 140,000 fighting troops to 175,000
and also to summon to the colors the
60,000 reservists.
Mr. Kahn then proposed as an in
ditement a provision in the senate bill
that while the enlistment period
should remain fixed three years with
the colors and four years in reserve,
commanding officers might discharge
peculiarly efficient men into the re
serve after one year of training and
that any well trained man could go
into the reserve on his own applica
tion at the end of two years' active
service.
The amendment was defeated, 113
to 108.
Encouraged by the narrow margin
which defeated the Kahn amendment,
Representative Gardner reoffered the
first proposition of that amendment
in new language. It was carried, 128
to 117, being the first defeat for Chair
man Hay during consideration of the
bill.
The amendment as agreed to pro
vides that soldiers may be discharged
into the reserve at the end of one
year's service with the colors on ap
proval of their commanding officers.
Chairman Hay argued that the effect
of the provision was to reduce the
term of enlistment with the colors to
such a degree that the efficiency of
the army as a whole would be im
paired. Representative Gardner con
tended that it would encourage enlist
ment and tend to build up quickly a
well trained reserve.
Fate of the Kahn Amendment.
The debate on the Kahn amendment
yesterday was spirited and resulted in
the defeat of the amendment Pecu
liarly, the strongest arguments for and
against the Kahn amendment were
made by Illinois republicans. Repre
sentatives Mann and Madden led the
fight for it and Representative McKen
zie led the fight against it. McKenzie
brought the whole army of no defense
democrats to their feet with yells of
approval when he declared the only
people in the country who want a large
standing army are society people and

Cigar and Cigaret Manufacturers
Only One of Many Cheating Gov
ernment, Claim.
Washington, March 21. Treasury
official declare that arrest of cigar
and cigaret manufacturers in New
York yesterday on charge of defraud
ing the government of internal rev
enue taxes, only scratched the sur
face of fraudulent practices which
have extended from manufacturers to
retailers and even consumers all over
the country.
So far the investigation has not
shown just when the conspiracy be
gan, but it is believed that it may be
traced as far back as 25 years. Esti
mates of the amount out of which the
government has been defrauded are
not believed now to be accurate, but
some run up to $10,000,000. Only a
small part of the amount can be re
covered, but the government intends
to bring civil proceedings to get back
every cent possible and to imprison
such offenders as can be reached.
Most of the leaders of the alleged
conspiracy are said to be under sur
veillance and more arrests are ex
pected. Under the law cigars are taxed
from 75 cents to $3 a thousand and
cigarets from $1.25 to $3.60 a thous
and. Failure to use proper revenue
stamps or to use any at all gave an
opportunity for large profits.
Reports that the frauds had been
made possible or inspired generally
by government employes in collusion
with conspirators were denied. A few
specific instances where officials sus
pect collusion are under investiga
tion. BOTH LAY CLAIM

The official statement pays a tribute

Austrian troops who gave way only on
account of the superior strength of
the Russian attacking forces. It adds
that the only means left to the Aus
