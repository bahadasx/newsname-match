Mexican Soldiers Supposed

PERMISSION TO USE

First Chief Asks Additional
Information Before He
Will Cooperate
El Paso, Tex., March 20—
Carranza troops stationed
at Casas Grandes and
other points of that section
at the time General Persh
ing began his march into
Mexico now are located at
Juarez, opposite El Paso,
and in the rear of General
Pershing's columns, it was
authoritatively stated to
day.
No reason has been as
signed for the transfer of
troops from points inland
to the border.
From reliable sources it
Is stated also that in one
instance a Carranza de
tachment allowed Villa to
pass southward on receipt
of a message from the
bandit leader that he was
not warring against Mexico.
El Paso, Tex., March 20. —Villa has
doubled east and south to Namiquipa,
according to a telegram reoeived here
by Oen. Oavlra at Juarez. He reports
that Carranza troops are advancing
from the south while the Americana
are continuing their march from the
north In an effort to close the net
around the bandit.
After leaving El Valle, where he had
abandoned thirty of his wounded, Villa
turned directly west to San Miguel
Babrioora, said Gavira, who explained
that he had learned the Babricora,
where Villa was reported yesterday,
was San Miguel Babrlcora, and not the
Babricora near the lake of that name,
some miles farther to the south on
Mrs. Phoebe Hearst's ranch. San Mig
uel Babricora is about twenty miles
west of El Yalle. tftom that point
Villa made a sudden twist and struck
toward Namiquipa, forty miles south.
Oen. Oavira knows nothing of the
American troops except that they are
hard on the chase. Nor has he any
details of the Carranzista troops co
operating in the movement. Col. Cano
was the closest to Villa at last reports,
as his advance posts came within sight
but not in conflict, with Villa's fleeing
rear guard at El Valle.
No train has left Juarez for Casas
Grandes since yesterday and none is
expected to leave today or tomorrow, it
Is said.
Look for Clash.
A clash between the Villista and
Carranza forces is imminent, accord
ing to advices received here today
from Oen. Oavira.
Villa, fleeing south before the rap
idly advancing American troops, is
apparently trying to break through
the Mexican-American cordon closing
in about the Laguna-Babricora region.
He is seeking a loophole in the direc
tion of Namiquipa through which he
can escape into the mountains around
Guerrero and Santa Ana.
The Carranzistas are advancing
north from Namiquipa. As the bandit
is traveling south from El Valle, a few
hours should decide whether he can
evade the troops of Gen. Carranza.
But the interest in the chase after
Villa is almost overshadowed on the
border by anticipation of the reply of
Gen. Carranza to the request of the
American government for permission
to use the Mexican railroads.
Juarez and El Paso preserved the
same air of outward calm today that
has marked them since the troops of
the United States crossed the interna
tional line but there was an air of ex
pectancy everywhere and a strong un
der current of excitement.

CARRANZA GIVEN
ASSURANCE THAT
CITIES ARE SAFE
PROTEST OF MEXICAN CHIEFTAIN
BRINGS REPLY TOWNS WILL
NOT BE OCCUPIED.
Washington, D. C., March 20.
Gen. Carranza today replied to the
American government's request
for use of Mexican railroad lines
for movement of supplies to the
punitive expedition with a request
for more complete Information of
exactly what the war department
wants. Gen. Carranza's reply was
sent to President Wilson. The In
formation he asks will be fur
nlahed.
Washington, D. C., March 20. —Gen.
Carranza has formally protested
against American troops occupying
Casas Grandes in their pursuit of Villa
and the American government has re
plied that the troops have been order
ed specifically not to occupy Casas
Grandes or any other towns or cities
in Mexico.'
The protest and reply were included
in an exchange of notes between Act
ing Secretary Polk of the state depart
ment and Eliseo Arredondo, ambassa
dor designate from the Mexican gov
ernment to the United States.
After a conference today between
Mr. Wilson and Mr. Polk it developed
that Mr. Polk in a note forwarded to
Mexico yesterday said instructions had
been forwarded to Gen. Funston to
keep his troops away from all towns.
The state department today had not
received a reply from the request sent
to Carranza for the use of Mexican
railroads in transporting supplies to
the expeditionary force.
In urging the use of Mexican rail
roads for that purpose, it has been
pointed out to the Carranza govern
ment that similar permission was
granted Carranza troops for the use of
railroads in the United States last
year.
The administration realizes fully the
difficulty of Gen. Carranza's position
because of feeling in Mexico. For that
reason every effort is being made by
the state department to disseminate in
Mexico the information that the Unit
ed Stateq had no motives of .aggression
in sending troops across the border.
Following out the same policy the
American troops now in Mexioo have
been given instructions to be careful in
their dealings with Mexicans generally.
All acts which might be construed as
offensive to the Mexican people are to
be avoided.
Generally, reports from Mexico to
day were optimistic in character.
Gen. Carranza, it was learned to
day, had been urged by some of his
closest advisers to offer a large reward
for the apprehension of Villa.

RESENT INVASION
ARCHBISHOP OF MONTEREY SAY8
IT IS BUT NATURAL TO OB
JECT TO EXPEDITION.
Chicago, March 20.—The punitive
expedition into Mexico in search of
Francisco Villa will not meet with the
approval of the Mexican people, in the
opinion of the Most Rev. Francis Plan
carte, archbishop of Monterey, state of
Nuevo Leon the Most Rev. Leopold
Ruiz, archbishop of Morelos, state of
Michoacan, and the Rev. John Na
varette, priest at Aguas Calientes,
who are in exile from Mexico and are
living here.
"We have not had word from Mex
ico since the present *risis arose, so,
of course, we can not say positively
what the feeling is," said Father Na
varette. "But put yourself in our
place. No matter what happened in
the United States, would you like to
have a Canadian army invade the
country to correct it?"
In the opinjon of the priest, inter
vention with lood rather than with
soldiers would cost less and would
meet with the approbation of the peo
ple much more surely. He said the
reason men were fighting with the ar
mies in Mexica was because they had
no food and preferred to fight and
perhaps die in the armies rather than
to starve to death at home.
SILK WORKERS TO
HAVE NEW STRIKE
Paterson, N. J., March 20.—The
executive committee of the Brother
hood of American Silk Workers an
nounced today that the manufacturers
have been given until Wednesday to
reply favorably to a demand for a
nine hour day. Unless the demand is
granted the committee announced a
strike will be ordered, which, they say,
will tie up all silk plants here.
At the conclusion of Paterson's big
silk mill strike in 1913, the workers
were promised, according to spokes
men for the committee, that a nine
hour day would go into effect as soon
as conditions would permit,

GERMANS THINKS
DUTCH SHIP WAS
CHARGE THAT ENGLISH SUBMA
RINE WA8 8IGHTED BEFORE
TUBANTIA TORPEDOED.
Berlin. March 20.—The Cologne
Volks Zeitung reports that several
credible witnesses stated that shortly
before and after the sinking of the
Dutch steamship Tubantia a British
submarine was observed,,near Noord
hinder lightship," says the Overseas
News agency.
"There is good reason to believe that
a British submarine sank the Tu
bantia.
"Count von Reventlow In the Tages
Zeitung also expresses a suspicion that
a British submarine sank the Tubantia,
particularly in view of the statements
of officers of the vessel, that they
observed the course of a torpedo.
Count von Reventlow says that in sev
eral similar
caseB
previously there
were indications that British sub
marines destroyed neutral steamers,
while the press at the same time was
spreading reports that German sub
marines were responsible, thus creat
ing ill feeling against Germany in
neutral countries."
In response to similar reports previ
ously from German sources, the Brit
ish government last week denied there
was any ground for conjecture that
the Tubantia might have been sunk
by a British submarine.
TWO VESSELS SINK.
London, March 20.—The sinking of
a neutral and a British steamship,

the loss of one or more lives, was

survivors were rescued. The British
steamer was the Port of Dalhousie.
Her mate, pilot and five men were

senator to fill the vacancy caused by
the death of Senator Benjamin F.
Shively by Gov. Ralston today. Mr.

The new senator has been promi

Mr. Taggart was auditor of this

HAT BILL SEEMS
SURE OF PASSAGE
Washington, D. C., March 20.—Rep
resentative Kahn's proposal to put the
regular army at 220,000 men, an in
crease of 80,000 over the administra
tion bill, was lost in the house today
by a vote of 183 to 103.
A proposal to outdo the Kahn
amendment by making the army 260,
000 men was lost without a roll call.
A rising vote on the Kahn amendment
itself showed 32 for it and 153 against
it. Mr. Kohn demanded a record vote.
The house then proceeded to other
amendments.
Party lines were broken down in the
debate. Representative Caldwell,
democrat, of New York, supported the
incr6ftB6i
"The passage of this bill, without
the amendment would be ridiculous,
if not pathetic," he said. "Today in
Mexico we witness a skeleton army
fighting with an army of skeletons."
Representative Towner, republican,
of Iowa, opposed the proposal, and
Representative Greene, republican, of
Vermont, supported
vit.
Representa­
tive Anthony, republican, of Kansas,
and Representative Dyer, republican,
of Missouri, opposed the amendment.
SENATE BILL HELD UP.
Washington, D. C., March 20.—
Chairman Chamberlain of the senate
military committee has decided not to
call up his army reorganization bill
until the house bill comes up.
"It may be that we will take some
portions of the house bill and revise
our own, or we may merely submit
the senate bill as a substitute for the
house measure," he said. "In any
event I think I shall wait until the
house acts before attempting to start
general discussion of the subject in

London, March 20.—A strong French
column with light artillery from the
Saloniki entrenched camp has attack
ed and oocupled the villages of Macl
kovo, Karadagh and Kozuna, which
had been entered by Teuton and Bul
garian forces, according to a Reuter
dispatch from Saloniki, dated March
18. The French bad only a few cas
ualties.
Owing to the encroachments of the
Teuton allies into Greek territory and
the consequent advance of the French
the neutral frontier zone which had
been agreed upon between the Greek
and Bulgarian governments 1b now
eliminated. Forces of the central
powers and of the entente allies are
face to face, the dispatch adds, and
shelling, sniping and grenade throw

hood of the above mentioned villages
about thirty miles north of Saloniki,
as on the other fronts where the ad
versary forces are in contact.
RUMANIA TO FIGHT?
Athens, March 20.—The impression
prevails in high political circles at
Athens that Rumania shortly will
abandon her policy of neutrality In
favor of the entente allies.
Should Rumania enter the war
Greek officials would be placed in an
embarrassing position, the force of
which already is felt. Military repre
sentatives of the entente allies do
not disguise the fact that at present
they have no need for Greece and do
not desire to assume responsibility
for maintenance and equipment of the
Greek army unless they are assured
definitely of cooperation in the event
of an allied offensive in Macedonia.
The course of the fighting at Ver
dun has produced a marked impres
sion on even the most determined
noninterventionists and the royalist
press Is changing its tone in regard
to participation of Greece in the war.
The feeling
of
allied diplomatists
seems to be that if Greece desires to
enter the war now she will have to
do so on her own Initiative and with
no conditions with respect to terri
torial compensation.

Zeebrugge is on the Belgian coast
twelve miles northeast of Ostend.
Since the German occupation this .port
