Mr. Arrendedoa also discussed with Mr.

Speed la regarded by State department
officials as of the utmost Importance and
every effort Is expected to be made by
Mr. Arrendondo to have. General Car

WASHINGTON, March 20.-In a "safety

killed In a rear-end collision caused by
his failure to flag, an oncoming train.
"Ills fate give cause to blame," said
the court, "but we cannot help pointing
out that the tragedy of the collision might
have been appalling. How Imperative his
duty was Is manifest. To excuse Its ne
glect In any way would cast Immeasur
able liability upon the railroad and, what
la of greater concern, remove security
from the lives of those who travel upon
them, and, therefore all who are con

a full and anxious sense of responslblity."

SITUATION IS VERY GRAVE
KI. PAPO, Tex.. Msrch -The Car
renza forces have failed to hold their end
of the net that was closing about Pancho
Villa and the bandit has escaped to his
mountain haunts about Guerrero, ac
cording to reliable Information received
l.ere today.
Tho escape of the bandit la, however,
far from being the most serious Item of
news which reached the border today.
A feature of the gravest Importance
waa Injected into the situation by sub
stantial confirmation cf the numerous re
ports received for tha last week that the
Mexican troops were not only fulling to
oo-operate with the American troops, but
in certain Instances, at least, were act
ually withdrawing from the field of
operations.
Troops Withdrawn.
The Associated Tress learned on un
questionable authority that troops of the
de facto government which had been
stationed at Casaa Grandea have ben
withdrawn and are now In and about
Juarez, From the same' source It was
yearned that at least one detachment of
Carranza troops had refused to fight
Villa and had withdrawn on tho bandit's
approach, leaving him free to pass Into
his favorite mountain fastnesses In the
great continental divide south of Nami
quipa. This detachment withdrew on re
ceipt of a message that he waa warring
not on Mexicans, but the enemies of Mex
icans. ,
The extraordinary rapidity with which
the American cavalry had .pushed Into
"Mexico gave rise to high hopes yesterday
that the unexpected had happened and
the notorious bandit was cornered. Thla
seemed Inevitable If the Carranza soldiers
did their part and if the account of- the
strength of their field forces was correct

More than thla It now seems certain
that Villa is movnig freely In at least
a large section or the country supposed
to be held by the troops of the first

EL PASO. Tex., March 20. The
railroad problem overshadowed
everything else here In the Mexican
situation today. The reply of Gen
eral Carranza to the request of the
United States government for per
mission to use the railroads waa ex
pected to be sent forward to Wash
ington today. A refusal will em
barrass tha operations of the Amer
ican troops, while the granting of
the request would be bound to be
seriously misconstrued by a consid
erable section of the Mexican peo
ple, and. ' to be exploited . by the
enemies of Oenerai Carransa.
The unexpectedly repid advance of the
expeditionary columns under Genersl
Pershing has forced the railroad ques

the country Into which tho columns are
now entering assert that It Is Imperative
that the railroads be placed at their dis
