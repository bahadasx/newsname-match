The defense Introduced leu photo

another. Ho atutcd that tho tloor
of the front room of tho houae, from

pot a hero Mm. Kuehno was stand
Ins when shot.
C. M. Onolll briefly croaa question
rd Henry on different deration!
around the place and mnttera brought
out In direct testimony.
J. N. Ilolmon told of being at Mer
rill with Henry Stout on tho morn
ing of tho tragedy, and of going to
the homestead upon bearing of the
trouble. Ho told of soelng footprlnta
and empty shells In the Mold whoro
Kuehno said ho began ahootlng.
Kuebne, the witness aald, told hlni

that the following day he traced tho

on tho nldo or tho houae oppoalte that

When a camera waa on the apot
where Mm. Hunter told him Mm.
Kuehno roll, Holman aa)d he waa
landing nt the apot where he found
the ibclln ahot by Kuehno from near
tbe lowor gate. He aald he could
a ponton al tho camora from tho
knees up, declaring that a ralae In
the ground made It laipo-Hiblo to see
of n person from that dlatance.
He also mated that tbe spot In
dicated as where Mrs. Kuehne fell
In almost direct line with the
Porch, and tho position where Kuehne

homo,
Holman testified Kuehne told him
the day of the hootl-i that h ha
twojfuns In the fight and that he ahot
which Mrs. Hunter soys she shot nt
Mrs Kuehno Ho stated that thcro
wns n bullet hole In tho top of the
screen, to the right of the center.
Holman was nlso naked regarding
the wounds on the horses hitched to
Hunter's wagon and the 'bullet hole
through the wagon scat. This hole,
ho stntod, was nppsrently caused by
a 22 rlflo fired from directly In front
of tho team.
The wltncsfi was then asked regard
ing finding a hole In tho wall of Mrs.
Kuohno's cabin. This called forth
n storm of objections, much explana
tion on the part or tho defense, and
much Interrogation on tho part of
the court.
"If the witness is permitted to tes
tify about this, ho will be equally well
qualMod to testify as to any number
of bullet holes, knot holes, etc.," said
Onolll. "Tho purpose Is to show that
Kuehne In shooting at tho wagon go
ing west of tho houao might have shot
the rabln. The defense would make
the matter relermnfand material flrat
before tho witness answers that ques
tion.
Af tor k further Interrogations, the
question was re-stated to tbe satis
faction of all, and then came the anti
climax the witness stated that ex
amination proved the aperture to be

neys nnd spectators nil Indulgod In

Tho defense then attempted to
brine out the story Mrs. Huntor told
of tho shooting, this story said to
have been told whllo she was semi
hysterical an hour or two after the
tragedy. In tho presence of the wit
ncss, Stout and others, but the state
objected, nnd tho objection was sua
ulned. Ronner tried to Introduce
this In several ways, and It was finally
dccldod that the testimony of all of
these witnesses regarding Mrs. Hun
ter's version of tho tragedy will be
submitted In written form to the court
and tho stnto's attorney for admis
sion before being submitted to the
Jury.
