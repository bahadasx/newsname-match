GOOD AUDIENCE
HEARS LECTURES
Prof. Bryant and Miss Sweeney, of
University, Talk on Farm Demon
strators and Home Economics.
The two lectures which were given
Friday afternoon at the court house
by Miss Mary E. Sweeney, head of
the Home Economics Department of
State University, and Prof. T. R.
Bryant of the College of Agriculture
of the same institution were both
very instructive and interesting, and
were heard by a good sized audience.
Dr. W. B. O'Bannon presided over
the meeting and introduced Miss
Sweeney in that clever and pleasing
manner which he possesses. He made
it clear that she is a specialist in
Home Economics Work which fact
no one doubted at the conclusion of
her address. At the close of his lec
ture, the chairman invited all ladies
who Avere interested in Miss Swee
ney's line of work to adjourn with
her to the county court room; here,
with a good audience, she continued
to discuss the home problems and to
tell how they should be met.
Mr. W. P. Givens, President of the
Alfalfa Growers' Associaton of Ken
tucky, introduced Prof. Bryant and
in doing so he emphasized the great
work that is being done by the Farm
Demonstrators in creating an interest
among farmers which causes them
to meet in Farmers' Institutes and
discuss the various problems with
which they are confronted from day
to day.
The circuit court room was filled
to its capacity, and many of the far
mers present expressed a desire to se
cure a County Agent who could as
sist in the solution of farm problems
and in increasing the yield of the
farm products in this county. Prof.
Bryant said: "If the Stanford
Graded School would have the Dem
onstrator teach Agriculture in the
school during three of the winter
months and give him a salary of 300
and if the county would raise $400,
the Extension Department will give
$800."
Krof. Bryant said in part:
An investigation of the present
status of farming in Kentucky quick
ly convinces one that mismanage
ment hac occurred somewhere. If a
young man Merits a fortune and
after a term of years we find that
his principal has materially decreas
ed, we say that he has made error
snmftwhere. We exriected him at
least to maintain the principal andl
we reasonably hoped that he would
add to his estate.
A parallel case is to be seen even
in our Bluegrass land. It seems
hard to say that farming has been
a failure. To be sure the farmer
has fed the country but at the same
time the young man referred to
above may have supported his fami
ly but in the end we must criticise
both him and the farmer because
they have each allowed their princi
pal to depreciate.
Several reasons may be assigned
for the depletion of so many of our
farms and farmers, but probably the
most important two reasons have
been a lack of knowledge of the cor
rect principles of farm management
and a full realization of the value of
a live stock system of farming. It is
hard to differentiate between these
two but inasmuch as the proper
handling of live stock is a matter of
farm management, we will discuss
for a few minutes some matters per
taining to live stock.
An adequate supply of manure is
the most efficient and generally ap
plicable method known, for the main
tenance of soil fertility. Animals
leave behind, about three-fourths o.
the fertilizing constituents contained
in the crops they eat. Seeing that
selling live stock or their products,
reduces the drain upon the fertility
of the soil it is clear that to main
tain the nroductive power of our
soils, we are almost driven to stock
farming. Observance and experi
ence bear out this statement.
All farmers know the congestion
that occurs in farm work during the
spring-and summer months. Men and
animals are required to labor thru
long hours, almost to the limit of en
durance. During the winter months
much time is spent loafing or merely
in pottering about. We should cul
tivate fewer acres, relatively, leav
ing to pasture certain areas, former
ly cultivated. This will give pasture
to cattle, swine or sheep during
spring or summer, and thus lessen
the volume of necessary labor, while
in winter we will find profitable em
ployment, caring for our stock.
The matter of labor is a serious
problem in many sections. We will
perhaps never have a complete solu
tion of the labor problem but there
is perhaps no greater means of relief
in sight than the adoption of a live
stock system. By devoting a larger
proportion of our land, in summer,
to grazing, we could get along with
less manual labor during the season,
in fact it could be almost reduced to
the force necessary to care for stock
and discharge other necessary duties
in winter. Again, we can reasonably
expect to get a more reliable class of
labor if we are in a position to offer
employment the year round at a fixed
wage. The laborer is forced to de
mand high wages in the summer be
cause he will be dispensed with when
winter comes and the summer labor
presents long hard hours. Let us
blame ourselves rather than the la
borer for the present situation con
cerning help.
By a live stock system we are en
abled to play the parts of both the
producer of raw materials and that
of a manufacturer and to reap the
profits of both. The producer of cot
ton, works long and hard through
the summer and in winter is virtually
idle while the manufacturer is busy
spinning and weaving the raw cot-
fton into cloth and is making a profit
by so doing. If we can grow the
crops in summer and in the winter
get busy spinning them into beef,
pork, mutton, milk or other animal
products we play the double parts
above mentioned and reap both pro
fits. Again we enrich our lands, keep
better labor and employ ourselves
more advantageously.
Breeding.
To get a clearer vision of our du
ties and opportunities, let us carry
a little further the illustration of the
factory. Within the factory, the suc
cessful operator installs the best ma
chinery that he can possibly acquire
because he knows that inefficient
machinery will sooner or later bring
him to ruin. It is equally important
to the farmer to piace within his
farm factory the most efficient ma
chine possible, in the form of the
animal. That means the class of an
imal that will top the market when
ready for sale. It would be gross
inefficiency to feed our corn into
hogs that will bring seven cents when
the "top notchers" are selling for
eight. It is folly to keep a cow that
gives 5,000 pounds of milk in a year
when she could be replaced by one
that would give 10,000 pounds.
The improvement jn the grade or
quality of animals can be most ad
vantageously secured under' average
conditions by the use of the pure
bred sire upo.i our native females,
selecting the best progeny for fur
ther breeding and b" the occasional
purchase of a pure bred female. To
say that the sire is half the herd does
not adequately express his value
when the sire is pure bred. In such
case he has a long ancestry devoted ment for the purpose for which it is
to a particular purpose. When suchjto be used. when through it a broad
no particular purpose, it is reason
able to expect greater potency on
the part of the sire than on the part
of the dam.
Feeding.
The manufacturer of the cotton
goods would not think of supplying
only cloth enough to a machine to
weave fifty yards of cloth in a day,
if that machine had a capacity of
eighty yards. That would be running
with his efficiency ruinously reduced.
Likewise we should feed an animal
all the feed that it has the capacity
for utilizing forvthe animal is only a
machine for converting the raw pro
ducts of our farm into a manufac
tured article. We sometimes see far
mers who seem to be trying to see
how little they can give theiv stock.
They forget that a larg.j proportion
of the ration i" consumed tu maintain
the animal and that in cutting down
the ration they preclude the possibil
ity of a gain, or a profit to the feed
er. The ration may be thus reduced
either in total amount given or by
allowing a deficiency in some compo
nent of the ration, such as protein.
To reduce the protein means to re
duce the ration, for the body econ
omy requires definite proportions.
We consequently are forced to study
the balancing rations.
Success in farming is so dependent
upon a knowledge of such points as
the balancing of rations, proper fer
tilization and rotation of crops, care
of fruit trees, etc., that it seems
hardly possible to reach the highest
success without the services of a
county agricultural agent. Lincoln
county should lose no time in apply
ing for such an agent.
Miss Sweeney's subject was the
"Education Value of Home Econo
mics." She spoke as follows:
Two of the most vital institutions
in the development of society are the
school and the home. In the school
the child has trained his social, indus
trial and civic ideals and in the hands
of the teacher lies the molding power
of the future citizens of any com
monwealth. As public servants in our
public school system the teachers are
fast realizing that their real mission
is to train their pupils for good cit
izenship by building their characters
and giving them ideals, which means
the training of hand and eye for use
ful action
At the birth of our republic in the
earliest years of our educational his
tory the home was both school and
industrial center where the child was
taught all which at that time was in
cluded in culure and was also given
the training necessary for the world's
trades because the world's manufac
turing was done in the home. Grad
ually due to many factors the indus
tries shifted from the home to the
factory and the educational function
to the school.
Steadily, imperceptibly these three
worlds, the business, the school and
the home which had previously been
one in the home, became widely sep
arated. The school has become large
ly a center for culture a place for
the study of world history, world lan
guage and world life. The factory
has come to be entirely detached from
education and exists for commerce
and revenue only. The home slowly
evolved from an economic educational
and moral center into a sort of shrine
an institution apart from society,
from trade, and from the schools.
Each world by this isolation has suf
fered .an irreparable loss. One by
one the functions formerly perform
orm-i
ed by the home for the child have
been taken over by the school, for
the world has come to realize that
the school is the best medium by
which society can give to the individ
ual those opportunities of body and
mind which will render him a heal
thy, intelligent, useful Citizen. The
state realizes that its prosperity, in
telligence and commeice depend not
only upon the training of its citizens
but upon their health their happi
ness and their ucefulnes3. V hat
does health require? Proper food,
fr""?!"3' lttJ5u!Sf
and shelter, and sane and wholesome I
recreation. Home Economics em
braces all the) concise, systematic,
scientific knowledge related to these
practical phases of life.
Looking backward at the develop
ment of Home Economics we see it
an ally of manual training, an intru
der in pure science and an appendix
of agriculture. Rarely has it been
absorbed and assimilated as a part
of education and recognized as a dis
tinctly creative type of work or as a
branch in which either initiative or
resourcefulness was demanded. The
place it occupies in the average
course of study is either a part of
the work in a state of experiment
or it has entered because of econo
mic pressure from without. Howev
er, until education takes it for bet
ter or for worse, makes it a correla
ted, co-ordinated part of every school
curriculum, offers it the same respect
it gives the distinctly cultural sub
jects, Home Economics can never
come into its own or develop in the
broad, strong way that it should.
So long as cooking is an end in
itself, it can never be more than man
ual labor made more efficient, but
when it is the means of awakening
the student's resources; making her
think in 'terms of labor, time, money
and material; of developing her ini
tiative, encouraging self reliance and
in assuming personal responsibility;
of being a potent factor in giving de
cision of character and causing her
to socialize labor then it has a life's
value and by its own intrinsic worth
justifies its place in the educational
system.
So long as sewing is merely an in
struction in the taking of stitches
and the making of garments; so long
as the pupil studies it only that it
may reduce the economic pressure
upon the home and as a means of
gratifying the vanity in dress among
our young women it. does not deserve
place in our .schools. However,
wllpn if tpnpViPC tTio fitnpsc n-F V10 wnr.
knowledge of textiles, their manufac
ture and production is given; when it
stimulates new interest and is the
means of acquainting the student
with trade conditions and economic
history, of establishing her responsi
bility to society and to the trade
worker, of putting a moral value up
on the manner of dress, then sewing
can no longer be omitted from the
school curriculum. Until those teach
ers who have specialized in Home
Economics, until superintendents and
principals idealize and culturize cook
fng and sewing, instead of making
them but the means by which con
structive ability of the student is de
veloped, they tall short of the oppor
tunities and possibilities which lie in
this branch of work.
It is hardly conceivable that the
head of a great manual training high
school when the students are making
picture frames, gavels and biscuit
boards, would consider them the end
in and of 'themselves of their train
ing. 'These are rather the, means by
which the student acquires judg
ment, skill and initiative and the
training in these concrete things is
that through them he may be made a
constructive agent and developed for
leadership. It is true that the bis
cuit board, the rolling pin and the
picture frame are necessary and
useful things, but are they the end
and purpose of manual training? No
more is the garment in the textile
laboratory or the pie in the cooking
laboratory the end and purpose of
courses in Home Economics
Is a woman's schooling less ade
quate for the demands of present day
life because as she gains a broad cul
tural training she has been given the
technical knowledge regarding the
laws of her health, the principles of
feeding her body, and safeguarding
her surroundings and securing proper
housing? Is it any less valuable to
experiment in combining foods than
in combining chemicals? Is the law
of atmospheric pressure, Avagadro's
hypothesis or the physical law gov
erning electric currents more import
ant than knowledge regarding the
milk supplv, the city water supply,
the disposal of the household waste,
heating of the house and its proper
ventilation?
The question is often asked "Why
i not learn these things at home?" For
the same reason that the state does
not consider adeciuate trainimr forllieved my Mother-in-Law, after all
the practice of medicine that the can-1
didate has simply studied in some
other physician's office but requires
before he takes the life of his fel
lowmen into his hands that he have
finished the prescribed course of stu
dy in some reputable school and that
he be able to pass an examination
given by the state authorities Like
wise with the lawyer, he must give
evidence by an examination of hav
ing finished a prescribed course of
reading and sudy which shall fit him
for the practice of law before the
courts, before he is granted the priv
ilege of appearing before the judi
ciary. The responsibilities of the
homemaker are so many sided, in the
care of the health of the family, its
proper maintenance, the manage
ment of the family Income, the rear
ing of the children, the sanitation
of the dwelling, the preparation of
food and the numerous other duties
which fall to her lot, that to do any
one or all efficiently and well she
must be trained.
In the last analysis the function of
Home Economics in education is to
xv.,, , j ,,., nt

and moral responsibility of the home
to the community; to take the con
crete things of the working man and
woman's life, and energize and vi
talize them so that living becomes a
fine art.

I was afflicted with Bladder trou
ble. I suffered such great pain that
the doctor had to take my urine. Af
ter the doctor had treated me two
weeks, I did not get any better. Re
membering that a few doses of Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root completely re-
the doctors who were called on her
Case had failed to do her any good,
I asked my husband to get me a bot
tle of Swamp-Root, which he did, and
I took it and threw the doctors' prep
arations away because immediately
after I started taking Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root I was greatly relieved.
My husband was so pleased he said
I should take one dozen bottles of
Swamp-Root, but by the time I had
taken seven bottles I was completely
restored to health. That was six
years ago and I have riot taken any
medicine since. My weight is 195

SALES AT DANVILLE MONDAY
Few Mules On Market Taylor &
Co.'s Auction Sales.
, Very few mules were on the mar
ket at Danville court Monday. The
Taylor Livery Company sold a num
ber of horses and several mules at
their auction sale in the afternoon.
Capt. T. D. English, as auctioneer,
kept things moving and closed the
sale at 3:30. Among the sales were:
Pair 4-year-old mules, sold by Joe
Irvine to Jas. Yowell, of Hustonville,
for $260.
Black 4-year-old mule, sold by Fox
& Farris, to Robinson Huguely, for

Four-year-old mule, sold by Hugh
Tarkington to J. H. Bean for $155.
Four-year-old mule, sold by W. T.
Robinson to J. H. Bean for $139.

BATTLE WITH VILLA BANDITS
May Be On Now in Mexico Carran
za Forces Meet Him
That Villa may be forced to fight
the American troops with 24 hours
was indicated by reports from Gen.
Pershing to Gen. Funston that the
Mexican fugitive had been defeated
near Cruces by Mexican troops and
will have to move northward along a
road over which American troops are
riding southward. Retreat is im
practicable. In conflict with Gen.
Pershing's report was an unofficial
one that Villa still engaged the Car-
ranza men at Cruces. Skepticism of
Mexican co-operation was aroused by
the reported withdrawal to Juarez of
many Carranza troops from the pur
suit. Three columns of the Ameri
can expedition were moving in the
far field, while additional cavalry with
scouts and supplies crossed the bor
der at Columbus, N. M. Six aero
planes began scouting at the front,
south of Cases Grandes. The first
column of pursuit was moving south
east, toward El Valle and the third
toward Carmen. The de facto gov
ernment of Mexico has m-onosed to
the United States the drafting of a
protocol under which American and
Mexican troops may co-operate in
pursuit of Villa and his bandits with
out danger of misunderstanding and
conflicts. Such a pact, it 'is stated
rwould be designed to set forth the
the
rights of the American forces in
Mexico and the nature of the co-ODer-
ation expected of Carranza.
LOCAL FIRM MAKES SALES.
The local real estate firm of
Hughes & McCarty, which is advertis
ing big for its patrons and pushing
sales, sold early this week for W. P.
Martin, his farm near Turnersvile to
T. J. Chandler, of Jonesville, Va.
They also sold the two-story building
on the Crab Orchard pike occupying
the site of the old toll-gate house to
J. L. Johi,on, of Harlan county.

THE "BATTLE CRY OF PEACE"
Great Spectacle To Be Shown at Op
era House Twice Wednesday.
The remainder of the Fourth Epi
sode of the Iron Claw will be pub
lished in Friday's I. J., being crowd
ed out today by press of advertising
and space for "The Battle Cry of
Peace," which will be shown at the
opera house here Wednesday mati
nee and night, v Next to "The Birth
of a Nation," the "Battle Cry of
Peace" has perhaps attracted more
attention than any other picture now
being shown in America, and that it
will be seen by a tremendous audi
ence here Wednesday night is fully
"The Battle Cry of Peace," is a
thrilling production showing what
might happen to the United States if
a foreign foe landed on her shores,
and urging preparedness against
such a contingency. The idea that
"power spells peace" is driven home
with a will. Peace-at-any-price ad
vocates are ridiculed and fallacy of
their position shown up. The film
without doubt is one of the most dra
matic ever shown in any city. It
shows the destruction of New York
City by a foreign fleet, whose 15-inch
guns topple building after building,
without being in range of our shore
batteries, while thousands of persons
are seen running about in their mad
effort to escape the bombardment
which continues from air and sea. A
portion of the United States fleet is
seen in combat with the over-whelming
fleet of the invaders. One of the
finest pictures shown is the sinking
of two of these battle ships, which
have been driven close to shore by
the foreign fleet, then comes the
landing of the foreign troops and
what they do to the inhabitants. Men
are torn from their homes and shot
by a. machine gun a short distance
away. The invaders are shown at
tacking the women and children, and
then if you have a drop of red blood
in your veins you are ready to fight.

CHURCH IN
HOT WATER
Conference of Brethren Hears Differ
ences Between Pastor and Offi
cers at Danville.
The pastor and a deacon from each
of about a dozen Baptist churches in
this section, were invited to meet at
Danville Monday, in an endeavor to
bring about a restoration of amicable
relations and co-operation between
certain of the members of the Dan
ville Baptist church, and the pastor
and other members. Rev. M. D. Ear
ly, pastor of the Stanford church,
went over, upon receiving the invita
tion, and the church designated T.
W. Jones to go as its representative
deacon when the invitation was
placed before it.
The trouble in the Danville con
gregation is the result of the Ham
Ramsey revival services which were
held in Danville a few months ago.
According to what the local men who
were present say, reports of what
were said at that time and since have
been spread broadcast by gossip, un
til a rupture has been caused in the
church between the pastor and a
majority of the congregation, and
other influential members and officers
of the church, which has caused the
latter to refuse to attend or to per
form services as officers of the
church. It was found that most of
the gossip was untrue.
The outside brethren were asked
to pass upon three points at the
conference Monday. These were in
substance:
First Whether any cause for of
fense to the members had been
given, by the church.
Second Whether the pastor had
offended these members in anyway,
Third If so, should amends be
made, and if not, what should be
done with the officers.
To the first two questions, the out-of-town
brethren gave decidedly neg
ative answers after hearing full state
ments from both sides, and in regard
to the third, they urged that the
past be laid aside, and that all of
the membership forget the bickerings
and gossip, which has been indulged
in and go to work with renewed zeal
in the Master's Cause, but suggested
that if the officers of the church
could not work in harmony with the
pastor and other members, they
ought to resign.
The trouble in the Danville con
gregation is said to have caused the
pastor, Rev. F. W. Eberhardt to ten
der his resignation upon two separate
occasions, anl each time he was
forced to withdraw it by the big ma
jority of the membership which is
standing behind him in the matter.
NICE GIFT FOR LANCASTER.
J. E. Thompson, of Mt. Vernon,
who travels for W. J. Sparks' fam
ous limestone quarry, was in Stan
ford Saturday, selling ground lime
to a number of local people who will
use it on lawns, etc., to make a fine
crop of grass this spring and sum
mer. Mr. Thompson spent several
days in Lancaster last week taking
orders. He says that Mr. Sparks has
agreed to donate enough lime to cov
er the new Lancaster city park, and
thus insure a splendid grass plat.
This gift from Mr. Sparks will un
doubtedly be highly appreciated by
the good people of Lancaster and
Garrard county.
FOUND DEAD IN BED.
Mrs. Lucy Anne Adams, aged 71
years, was found dead in bed at her
home at Rowland, last Wednesday,
when her daughter went to call her
about 8:30 o'clock. Heart disease
is believed to have been the trouble.
The burial was conducted by J. C.
McClary, at Ephesus church, south
of Crab Orchard Saturday. Mrs. Ad
ams was a good woman and beloved
by all who knew her.
Q. & C. BRIDGE GIVES WAY.
One span of the Tennesse river
bridge on the Queen & Crescent
route, north of Chattanooga, was
wrecked last week when a freight
car jumped the track and seventeen
cars fell into the river. All the train
men escaped injury. Traffic is be
ing detoured via Knoxville. It will be
some time before the bridge can be
rebuilt.
KEEP YOUR BOWELS REGULAR.
As everyone knows, the bowels are
the sewerage system of the body, and
it is of the greatest importance that
they move once each day. If your
bowels become constipated, take a
dose of Chamberlain's Tablets just
after supper and they will correct the
disorder. Obtainable everywhere.
LAYING 100-POUND RAILS
The L. & N. has placed along the
railroad between Stanford and Row
land 100-pound steel rails to take the
place of the 90-pound ones now in
service. Each year the company lays
a few miles of new rails on each di
vision, but heretofore only the 90
pounders have been used. The heavy
engines make the heavier rails neces
sary. A SPECIFIC AGAINST COLDS.
The nearest thing to a specific
against colds is a sleeping porch or
open bed room and a cold sponge
bath every morning when you first
get up. Even then you will occa
sionally take a- cold, especially when
colds are epidemic, and when you do
you will find Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy a great help in enabling you
to get rid of it. Try it. Obtainable
everywhere.
