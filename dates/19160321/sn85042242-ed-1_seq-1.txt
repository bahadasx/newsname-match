District.
London, March 20.—Heavy battles
have been in progress northwest and
northeast of Verdun and on the north­
ern part of the nussian front, where
(he Russians are keeping' up their
strong offensive against the Germans.
In all these zones the losses have
been large, while the changes in posi
tios have been relatively unimportant.
Northwest of Verdun, in the sector
of Avocourt-Mallencourt, the Germans,
after a heavy bombardment, made a
vigorous infantry attack in which li­
quid fire was employed against the
French front. A lresh German divi­
sion brought up participated in the ac­
tion. The French, however, with
their curtain of lire aided by machine
guns and infantry, put down the at­
tack with heavy casualties to the as
saulting forces, except in the eastern
part of the Mallencourt woods, some
miles from Verdun, where the Ger­
mans made slight, progress.
Heavy Losses.
IJcrlin reports the repulse also will)
heavy losses of the French, who at­
tacked the viljage of Maux, northeast
of Verdun. Elsewhere around tho
fortress there have been only inter
mittont bombardments and a continu
at'ion of lights in the air between
French and German aviators.
Another powerful German attack
this time between Avocourt and Mai
lencourt, west of the Mouse, resulted
in heavy losses to the Germans, ac­
cording to tho.official communication
issued by the French war office to­
night. A fresli division brought up
from a distant point was used in this
operation, which was characterized by
the employment of jet liquid flames
At one point east of the Mallencourt
woods, the Germans made some slight
progress.
Repulse Russians.
Although lierlin claims that the
Germans again have repulsed the Rus
sians in repeated attacks with strong
forces around Postavy and between
lakes Narocz and Dreswiaty, Petro
grad reports a German check south of
lake Dreswiaty, and the capture of
German trenches in the lake Narocz
region. Several villages in this dist
rict also have been taken by the Rus­
sians.
In Galicia, the Russians have cap
tured Austrian trenches and a bridge
head east of the village of Mikhaltche.
CONGRESSMEN FIGHTING
HARD FOR NAVY PORK
Washington, 'March 20.—The rival
claims of five navy yards to prefer
ment in the appropriation for en­
largement and equipment to be made
in connection with the national de
fense program were argued today be­
fore the house naval committee.
Senator Poindexter and Represent­
ative Humphrey of Washington ap­
pearing in favor of the bill passed by
the senate Friday, to make $2,005,000
available for improvement of the Bre­
merton yards at Puget Sound, attack­
ed the statement of Rear Admiral
Benson, chief of operations, before
the committee last week, that the
capital plant be located on the Paci­
fic at San Francisco. Arguments for
development of the yards at Norfolk,
Charleston and Philadelphia, respect
ively, were made by 'Representative
Holland of Virginia, Whaley of South
Carolina and Vare of Pennsylvania.
Proponents of the Bremerton plant
said that as more than $11,000,000
lias been spent there, the yards could
be put into capital condition for a
sum wlhicli would be nominal compar­
ed to the cost of improvements Ad­
miral Benson proposed for San Fran­
cisco. 'Representative Holland de­
clared Norfolk occupied the best
strategical position on the Atrantic
and in time of war would be the only
refuge in which warships could be
repaired in time of war.
BRYAN
CLASHES
WITH TOWNSMAN
Lincoln, March 20.—A wordy dis-'
pute between Wm. J. Bryan, former
secretary of state, and John G. Maher,
a local politician, in which the lie was
passed to Mr. Bryan in a hotel lobby,
enlivened the informal meetiftg pre­
vious to the prohibition mass meeting
tonight.
The dispute arose over a question
of Mr. Maher, as to whether one ofthe
speakers was getting paid for his ser­
vices. Mr. Bryan interposed the re­
mark that Maher's motives were mer­
cenary. This provoked the retort, and
Mr. Maher followod it up with other
charges.

Chicago, March 20.—After devoting
several hours to discussion of the
qualification of numerous candidates
for temporary chairman of the Repub­
lican National convention to be held
in Chicago June 7, the sub-committee
on arrangements of the National com­
mittee today was unable to reach a
decision and deferred action until to­
morrow. If the members are unable
to agree at tomorrow's session, the
subject will go over until the next
meeting, April 20
Among names suggested for tem­
porary chairman were: Senator War­
ren G. Harding, of Ohio. President
Nicholas Murray Butler, of Columbia
University of New York Philander
C. Knox, of Pennsylvania Senator VV.
E. Borah, of Idaho Governor Samuel
C. McCall, of Massachusetts Senator
Henry C. Lodge former Governor
Chase C. Osborne, of Michigan, and
Senator George Sutherland, of Utah.
Senator Harding of Ohio, it was
said, was regarded with more favor
than the others in the preliminary
discussion, the argument being used
that he would be acceptable to the
stalwart and progressive factions of
the party. The same argument was
used in support of T. C. Knox. At the
close of the discussion the indications
were that the choice might be be­
tween Harding, Butler and Knox.

AFTERJEN YEARS
Resignation to Take Effect After
Easter Sunday Will Go to
Bozeman, Montana.
I -A*. •V.'i.
PETITIONED TO
REMAIN HERE
Dr. C. IW. Harris, w'ho for the last
ten years has been pastor of the
First Presbyterian church, presented
his resignation to his congregation
Sunday morning, to accept the pas­
torate of the Bozeman, iMont., Pres­
byterian church.
The church was crowded at the
morning service the congregation
anxiously waiting for the announce­
ment w-hidh he previously had slated
he would make. Although it was
generally understood he expected to
accept the E'ozeman call, yet many in
his congregation had hoped he would
decide to stay, since every induce­
ment was offered him to do-so. A
delegation of over half a hundred men
of the congregation called at the
manse during last week and petition
ed him to remain. Many in the con
gregation, Sunday, were visibly af
fected by tlhe announcement. Dr.
Harris has not only endeared himself
to members of his congregation, but
to the entire city, and many regrets
are heard because of his leaving.
Take Effect After Easter.
A meeting of the official board will
be held Thursday evening to act 021
his resignation, which will take effect
following Easter Sunday. Dr. (Har­
ris's resignation as presented follows
"My Dear Friends:
"When after ten years—years of
tender memories, bringing no regret
—a minister speaks those words to
his church wfoicli dissolve the pas­
toral relationship, he undertakes the
hardest task that, as a pastor, he has
been called upon to perform.
"In giving you my resignation 1
am not conscious of being actuated
by anything else than the desire to
do a little more good in the future
than I have done in the past. It is
not because I faave been dissatisfied
with my work in your midst it is
not because of any variance or strife
wtithin our church, which I thank
God has been altogether absent nor
is it because of any material good
which I might hope to come to me in
any future field of labor. I can best
describe ray conviction as an inner
compulsion. Every man has a mes­
sage from God. Mine is to preach
the gospel. "Unto me who am tfhe
least of all saints is this grace given
that I might preach the unsearchable
riches of Christ."
"It surely is conceivable, even to
you, who are most reluctant to have
me go, that I might feel that I should
give this message to otthers. When
the disciples found Jesus in the des­
ert tliey said 'All men seek thee.'
But. instead of returning with them
to the city He said 'Let us go into the
next towns, that I may preach there
also, for, therefore came I forth.'
When Paul upon his departure for Je­
rusalem was detained by his friends,
wlho feared for him and for them­
selves, he replied, "Why mean ye to
weep and to break my heart?" And
when he would not be persuaded,
they said, 'The will of the Lord be
done.'
"If anything could have altered my
conviction it would hare been what
you have said and felt these last

listed Men at

'Washington, March 20.—By refus
ing definitely to increase the regular
army provisions of the Hay bill, the
house today made it almost certain
that the measure will go to the sen­
ate virtually as framed and passed
by an overwhelming vote. Chairman
Hay of the committee was hopeful to­
night that a final vote would be
reached tomorrow.
The net results of the clay's debate
on the proposed amendment was to
sustain the recommendations of the
president as to the size of the regu
lar army. The Hay bill carries virtu­
ally the program mapped out by for­
mer Secretary Garrison in this re
^ard, but substitutes the federaliza­
tion of the national guard for Olio
continental army. The president has
approved the general outline, but
stands uncommitted as to details.
Defeated Proposals.
Three times during the day the
house defeated proposals to increase
the peace strength of the regulars
fixed by tho Hay bill at 140.000, capa­
ble of increase to 17."),000 by execu­
tive order, if war is imminent. The
debate centered upon the Kalin
amendment to lix the authorized
peace strength at 220,000, but tihe
first vote was on a substitute offered
by Representative Fuller or Illinois,
to make it 2ri0,000.
Substitute Fails.
The Fuller substitute was lost with­
out. a division. The Kalm amend
ment was voted down, I8:t to 1015, af
dw' 4&iva 'lurge standing amy
bad been made by .Representative
Maiui, republican leader, and other

Only two democrats supported the
Kahn amendment in debate and less
than a dozen voted for it. About 40
republicans voted against, it.
•Representative Crargo of the mili­
tary committee proposed to fix the
strength at 200,000, but it. was voted
down by a substantial majority.
Wlith this outstanding feature dis­
posed of, consideration of the remain­
der of the bill went forward rapidly.
About one-third of the measure had
been reviewed and approved when
adjournment for the day came. The
national guard, industrial reserve and
nitrate plant section are among those
still to be considered.
When the measure reaches the
senate, it is possible all but the en­
acting clause will be stricken' out and
the senate measure substituted as a
short d'ut through conference.
Debate Tillman Bill.
Debates in the senate on the Till­
man bill for an $11,000,000 govern­
ment armor plate factory neared a
close tonight with republicans assail­
ing the project as a menace to the
nation's safety, and democrats de­
fending it. as a precautionary step
worth all it would cost, even though
the plant never were operated.
The discussion will continue tomor
under an agreement to begin voting
on the amendment at 4 o'clock in
the afternoon. The democratic lead­
ers are confident the bill will pass by
a large majority, substantially as re­
ported by the naval committee.
Senators Lodge and Lippitt opened
the attack today, declaring the bill
would drive private armor pla'e man­
ufacturers out of business .and inevit­
ably delay naval construction. Sena­
tor Lodge said the government could
not produce armorplate at the price
its experts had predicted, and it
would, be almost criminal for the gov­
ernment to cripple its armor plate in­
dustry when a five year navy cpn
struction plan was to be undertaken.
Senator Lippitt said that the gov­
ernment had no thought of driving
the manufacturers out of busines?
and insisted, if war should come, the
government would need an armor
plate plant of its own to supplement
the output of the private concerns.

Great Consideration Is Given De
Facto Government by State
Department.
DEMANDS ARE
THOUGHT EXCESSIVE
Consitutionalists in Mexico Are
Preparing Tentative Drai't to
Protocol.
Washington^,l^Iarcii 20.—The de
facto government of .Mexico has pro­
posed to the United States the draft­
ing of ?. protocol, under which Ameri­
can and Mexican troops may co-oper­
ate in running' to earth Francisco
Villa and his bandits without danger
of misunderstanding or conflict. The
terms of such a formal convention
would be designed to meet all ques­
tions which may arise in the future,
setting forth the rights of the Ameri­
can expeditionary forces now in pur­
suit of the bandit chieftain, and the
nature of the co-operation expected
from the troops of the Carranza gov­
ernment.
These facts became known today at
the conclusion of a conference be­
tween Tliaso Arredondo, American
Mexican ambassador designate, and
acting Secretary Polk of the state de­
partment. Negotiations on the de­
tails will be in progress in a few days,
but the two governments are in agree­
ment. 011 the general principles in­
volved.
To Render Aid.
Meanwhile, however, the troops of
the defacto gover uncut are actually
co-operating with tho American forc­
es, and, according to information re­
ceived by the wa department, are
planning to renA^r even greater as­
sistance. Hi' n'Uitary officers al­
lowing it to.bocoiie known that the
'Carranza governn -,'t had promised
to move a laiv.e |fL 1 of its l,ropps up-
ing a branch into which the Ameri­
can cavalrymen under General Per
shing may uniie and capture General
Villa.
General Pershing in a delayed dis­
patch which reached the war depart­
ment. late in the day, reported that in
the raid on Columbus, X. M„ Villa
lost 200 men. The losses included
men killed and wounded.
Want Complete Understanding.
The proposal for the protocol, which
it is planned to have remain in force
until Villa is captured, came from Mr.
Arredondo, and was a direct result' of
the request of the United States for
permission to use the railways be­
tween El Paso and Casas Grandes for
shipment of supplies to the expedi
tionary forces. Mr. Arredondo is un
derstood to have received instructions
from General Carranza to discuss the
request with the state department
and to propose the agreement by
which a complete understanding will
be had by both governments.
Each Point Covered by Agreement.
While the convention will provide
for all matters such as the use of
Mexican railways by American troops,
the specific request for permission to
ship supplies from El Paso will be dis
posed of separately. General Carran
za has asked for additional informa
tion upon the subject and it will be
forwarded to him immediately. State
department officials declined to dis­
cuss the nature of the information de­
sired, on the ground that, while the
negotiations are in progress, they
must be held to be confidential.
Preparing Tentative Draft.
After his conference with Mr. Polk
Mr. Arredondo started to prepare a
tentative draft of the agreement
which will be submitted to General

RIVER-MATT GOr
OVER BANKS TODAY
The ice in the Missouri river at
Eismarck broke up yesterday, at :i:30
m. The ice broke for a distance
of about one-half mile above the
bridge, and passed through under the
bridge and lodged down the river
near Sibley island. Other ice from
above moved down and lodged against
the piers of the bridge and remained
there until we went to press. The
stage of the river at the time the ice
broke was in.2, but fell two feet
when the ice passed out, rising again
slowly until at 10:00 p. m. last night,
a stage of was reached. The
Agaard and other bottoms along the
river south of town, as well as some
of the meadows near the river above
town were under water last evening.
Reports received from various sourc
es indicate that the Missouri is open
in places as follows: Mobridge, S.
1). Ft. Yates, Cannon'Ball, Bismarck.
Stanton. Deapolis, and at all points
above Elbowoods. At the latter
point a stage of water higher than
was ever recorded in Hie past 40
years prevails. The rise at that
point Sunday night was 15 feet, mak­
ing a total rise of 22 feet. This rise
was caused by a gorge of ice some
distance below the Eerlhold agency.
Doubtless other and smaller gorges
have formed between Bismarck and
Elbowoods, and as these let loose
will force the ice out below, and will
undoubtedly cause a serious overflow
at 'Bismarck within the next. 36 hours.
All residents living in the country
near the river have been warned to
move out, as have the residents in
Mandan in the extremely low parts
of the town. Should a sudden rush
of water be likely, warnings will be
sent to all residents of Bismarck to
move to higher ground by the blow­
ing of 12 blasts of the whistle of the
Hughes Electric company's plant.
The Northern Pacific Railway com­
pany's roundhouse at Mandan will
blow a like warning to residents of
that city.

PUSHING FUGITIVE
TOWARD NORTH
San Antoiiio, .March 20.—Francisco
Villa may be forced into a light with
tho Carranza troops within the next
i(i hours, if reports coming to General
Funston's headquarters, both from
General Pershing and Mexican sourc­
es are correct.
General Pershing reported today
that Villa had been reported defeated
by Mexican government troops near
La .CruwK,- aiid- nuti$hftvs
northward on tho retreat.
General Pershing's report was fol­
lowed, however, by the unofficial re­
ports that Villa was still fighting at
Xamiquipa, south of La Cruces.
Must Move Northward.
If the Carranza forces win in the
fighting that was said to be continu­
ing late today, Villa will have to move
northward along a road over which a
detachment of American troops is rid­
ing southward, or leave the road and
head for the San'a Maria mountains
that parallel the road to the east, or
to the Oriental range on the west side.
This, according to reports, is impract­
icable, owing to the presence, in the
rear, of Mexican troops, who forced
him to turn northward from La Cru.
ces.
The detachment that is headed
south on the road along which Villa
was reported advancing, is one of
three subdivisions operating south of
Casas Grandes.
Troops Split Up.
One column was sent toward Lake
Babicora, 70 miles south of Casas
Grandes, and somewhat to the west.
The other two detachments moved as
one to Galena, south and east of Casas
Grandes and there separated, one con
tining in a more easterly direction to­
ward Carmen, 05 miles from Casas
Grandes, and the other south toward
La Cruces, which now has become the
advance base of the expeditionary
forces.
Movements Hidden.
Just where General Pershing is was
not announced, but he is directing the
work of the three detachments and by
means of scouts is attempting to keep
in communication.
It was known at headquarters, how­
ever, that divergent directions will
make tihs difficult also the moun­
tainous character of the country will
afford elevation that will make more
feasible communication by signaling.
From all points to which the three
detachments are moving, Villa has
been reported in the vicinity. Al­
though it is realized that he could not
have been at all points where he was
said to have been, the three detach­
ments will be so widely separated by
the time they have gone a short dist­
ance farther that, it was regarded as
almost certain that one of them would
come in contact with him. The force
moving toward La Cruces was only a
short distance north of Valley, 28
miles north of La Cruces, this after­
noon.

bandits led by Villa in Namiquipa, ac
cording to a dispatch received this af­
ternoon by General Gavira, Carranza

time of the receipt of the dispatch.
Namiquipa is in the district of Guer­

Colonel Cano is in command of a

Fail to Hold Net.
In spite of reports that the Carran*
za forces had engaged Villa's men at
Namiquipa, there seems to oe a feel­
ing here that the Carranza forces
have failed to hold their end of the
net, closing about the bandit chief.
There were confirmatory reports re­
ceived today of the news received last
week that the Mexican troops were
not only failing to cooperate with the
American troops but in certain in-
stances, at least, were actually with
drawing from the field of operations.

Carranza troops had refused to
Villa and had withdrawn On the b'an
dit's approach, leaving him free to
pass. "-1
In the last few days, Villa has been
variously reported by General Gavira,
the Carranza commander at Juare*f.*t
points along the line reaching north
and south from Galeana to Nami^ul1
pa, a distance of about 75 miles. By
the same accounts, he has not been
moving steadily south, but roving
north and east. The mountainous can­
yon-split, roadless country, in which
he is operating, adds many miles to
Ihe country he has covered as com­
pared with its distance on the map.
Movement Unexplained.
The reason for the Carranza troops
moving to the border remains unex­
plained. It is impossible, even to
make a fair estimate of the number of
men under General Gavira at Juarez.
The large staff at his headquarters
and the fact that new troops are ar­
riving daily, indicates that his force
is a large one. The most conservative
estimate places it at 3,000, and calcu­
lations range from that point upward
to 8,000. Every precaution has been
taken to prevent the facts being
known, and most of the men are kept
outside the town among the hills. Re­
ports from Agua Prieta and Ojanaga
tell of Mexican reinforcements reach­
ing those points also, but nothing is
known as to their numbers.
There is no question that there is
serious and growing uneasiness in El
Paso.
A large body of American cavalry
left Columbus today. The troops
which were brought here from the
Texas border points were preceded
by a motor train, carrying supplies.
Whether the detachment will serve
as a separate command in the effort
to capture (Francisco Villa, or wheth­
er it is to join the punitive expedi*
tion in the field under General 'Per­
shing, somewhere in northern Chihua
jhua, was not indicated by military
authorities.
Scouts Know Trails.
Accompanying the troops were a
number of American scouts, said to
!know the trails of the Chihuahua,
mountains as the city man knows hla
front yard.
Wearing the sombrero of the fron*
tier, heavily rolled furs, and with
little wrinkles at the corner! of their
eyes, bespeaking lives spent in tho
open, the scouts form what is said
