PROTOCOL MAY
BE NEXT STEP
Aexico Urges Formal Agree
ment for Pursuit of
Villa Bandits.
POLK FAVORS NEW PLAN
Would Allow Armed Forces of Both
Nations to Prosecute
Chase.
Proposals were exchanged yesterda::
between the United States and the de
facto government of Mexiet looking to
the drawing up of a protocol unde:
which the armed forces of both coun
tries may pursue Villa and his bandit
fjllowers as the common enemy of both
nations.
rhe original suggestion for the pro
tocol came from the Carranza govern
ment, and was laid before Acting Sec
retary of State Frank L. Polk by Eliseo
Airedondo. Carranza's Ambassador-des
gnate here. It represents, acording to
the Mexican Embassy, an earnest effort
on the part of Carranza to co-operate
with the United States &nd to avoid
friction which is certain t0 come be
tween the two governments if a vork
ing agreement of some kind Is not ar
rived at
Impressed by the evidences of good
will contained in the proposals, and
particularly by the activity which Mr.
Arredondo has shonn in seeking to
smooth out the difficulties uocasioned
by the entry of American troops into
Mexican territory. Acting Secretary
Polk is not only giving the proposals
serious consideration, but has made
counter suggestions as to the terms
of the protocuL
Dellnite Arrangement Planmed.
It is planned to have a definite ar
rangement drawn up to govern prac
ticaly every contingency which may
arise in connection with the pursuit of
Villa. such as co-operation between the
armed forces of both governments in
the field, the common use of railroads,
the passage of troops through towns.
and common assault on fortified towns
in which Villa and his followers might
seek refuge.
In order to make it plain that the
Washington administration and the Car
ranza government are seeking to work in
harmony, it is proposed that the same
privileges granted the American forces
should be granted Mexican troops should
the necessity arise for Mexican soldiers
to enter American territory. When once
drawn, it is proposed that copies of the
protocol should be distributed among the
field commanders of both forcea so that
the possibility of conflict might be re
duced to a minhnum.
The suggestions from the Mexican gov
ernment arc t'ge outgrowth of the request
made by the United St'ates for permission
to use the Mexican Northwostern Itail
road for the transportation of supplies to
Pershing's base at Casas Grandes from
El Paso. Tex. To this request Carranza
has not thus far acceded. uwing to his
fear that his consent might provoke in
dignation among the Mexican people.
That the Mexicans generally resent the
presence of American forces in their
country and that the situation is full of
serious pOssibilities on account of this
resentment is freely admitted both at
tile State Department and in embassy
circles.
Would Expedite Campaign.
At his conference with Mr. Arredondo
yesterday. however, Acting Secretary
Polk made it plain that from a military
standpoint the granting of the privilege
to use the railroad would enable Gen.
Pershing to expedite the wvrk of the ex
peditiun. and therefore enable him t<
shorten his stay.
It was intimated, following the confer
ence, that if Gen. Carranza saw fit t<
refuse sie request, the United State.
would employ autonlobile trains to pro
vision Pershing's forces.

Funlsta)n's late afternoon wireless today
from Gen. Pershing told how three
cavalry colfumns of Pershing's force are
spreading out from 'anas Grandes in the
hope of enveloping Villa.
One of these columns is well on its way
to Lake Babicora. below the Cumbre
Tunnel, -eventy miles ".- a wise crow

Grandes.
VIlla's loss in' the Culumbus raid is
now known to have been 200 men.
-It begins to look hopeful." said Gen.
Funston.
The general is satisfied that Pershing's
men are in the neighborhood of Villa.
After Gen. Funston had placed the
positions of the United States troops on
the big map in his office. he grimly re
marked:
"Our troops are well Into the region;
a good bit from the border."
More Motor Trucks Ordered.
Thought Carranga's delay is acceding|
to the request of the United States for
permission to use the Northwestern Rail

the shipment of supplies Is embarrassing,
news front the front shows that the
troops are n',tting some supplies front the

alfalfa is ott hand for the horses.
Gen. Funston is taking no chances on
the railway question and today requll
Stioned fifty-four motor trucks for ise

The aero corps Is now at Casas

three flying columns. Every require

Fourth, the stamp tax provisions of

which produced approximately $40,000,00D

The Congress leaders consider that the
levy of an additional $100.000.000 upon the

the right of the House leaders to choose
the proper sources of taxation. The

the situation.
German militaty ,rities. ven those who
at times criticize the general staff. are
unanimlous in deriaring the situation
satisfactory. The well-informed critic of

"The tactical situation of the Fiich

by the newest German souc-< sacsa t Mc I
Ionime and east of this hill. Tj those
who are disturbed by th slowness of
our advance, it may be said that the
tremendous .ffect of our heavy artillery
is enabling us to work slowly but surely
and with relatively small losses. Our
infantry is invarirbly finding the French
positions alicst entirely destroyed and
the i-nemy artillery more or less beaten
down.
Says Frencb Are Beate'.
'This form of battle requires time. The
German leaders are carefully avoiding
needless infantry attacks. I
"The conduct of the French under this
manner of attack is of great interest
stategically. They are now in the posi

protect his face but does not strike back
with his cane.
"They have linally retaiiated with

But the French know that this German
front is so strong: they could never sue

"The second possibility would be an
offensive by th. English in Flanders or
by the French west of the Argonne.
"Sut it must he clear to every expert
that the Gernnf general staff have in
eluded these possiilities in their careful
calculation and they are rot attacking
Verdin at the expense of other portions

'On the other hand. the Frerch have
been forced to take troops from the
Vosges front. etc.. to protect Verdun.
"We have had the strategic advantaze
since the beginning and, what is more
important. we still have it.
"It has been decided to enforce a rigid
