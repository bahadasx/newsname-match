Slav leader Who Won No

Japanese, Gains , Victories
Oyer the Kaiser's Troops
London, Mar. 21. Russian vlc-
toriea at both ends of the 800-mile
eastern battle line today overshadow
ed new German gains at Verdun.
General Kuropatkln, of Japanese
war fame, forced Field Marshal von
Rlndenburg to withdraw hla troops
from the salient south of Naracos
lake. Berlin admitted this was ne
cessary to avoid having the German
troopa annihilated by a circle of fire.
Berlin announced Russian attacks
had been repulsed south of Riga,
west of Jacofstadt, and northwest of
Postawy. .The Russians suffered
heavy losses.
At Usclecxvo, Russian artillery
forced the Austrian to abandon the
bridgehead, which bad been held tor
alx months against strong Slav at
tacks, according to the official Vienna
announcement '
Petrograd'a statement aald that
Teheran reported Russian troops last
Sunday . marched Into Ishpahan,
which they, had been menacing for
some time.
Petrograd, Mar. 21. 'Russian
troopa marched into Ishpahan Sun
day,' according to advlcea from Te
heran received today.
Ishpahan waa formerly the metro-
polla of Persia. It Is 210 miles south
of Teheran, in the midst of an ex
tensive plain, aurrounded by orch
ards. The Russians have been men
acing it for some time. ' .
The earlier Austrian official state
ment admitted the Important Rus
aian . victory Id southeastern Gallcla,
38 mllea north of Csernowlta. This
makes the Austrian position on the
north bank of the Dnelster precarious
and Is believed" to forecast the be
ginning of a new Russian campaign

20 miles 'east of Namlqulpa. Ab
sence of any news from the battle
field since late yesterday, at Juares,
that Villa waa at bay, led to fears to

In order to trap Villa It he escaped

Tho messages aald Ambaaaador
Gerard at Berlin bad postponed his
vacation at the request of Imperial
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg,
In order to be at his post if America's
services in peace negotiations should
be needed.
Von Bethmann-Hollweg recently
gave Gerard hla Ideas about accept
able peace terms during an hour's
discussion of peace possibilities.
Gerard had cancelled hla vacation
plans, and will remain at his poet
indefinitely.
The 'Post's information appears to
support recent United Press reports
from Washington that Colonel E. M.
House brought tentative peace terms
f f om Germany to President 'Wilson
after hla recent "mystery tour" of
Europe.
Gerard's talk with Hollweg Is de
clared to have followed a conference
between the imperial chancellor and
the kaiser. Hollweg told Gerard he
did not desire to state specific peace
terms, but that Germany was willing
to withdraw from Belgium without
demanding Indemnities.
The chancellor aald the German
public would demand indemnity for
withdrawal of the Teuton army from
northern France, and would also de
mand restoration of German colonies
taken by the allies.

battle as a concrete denial of reports
that Carranaa was disposed to let
Villa get away In order to give him
an equal chance against the Ameri

base of operations near : Casas
Qrandes. Reports that t,he garrison
there waa going to Juares were un
confirmed. Even If large bodies of
Carransistaa placed themselves be

the border, It waa pointed out that
thousands of soldiers at Fort Bliss
and Columbus were ample protection
against the Implied threat. 1
There is no sign of friction be
tween de facto troops and .Americans.
It was reported that in return for
President Wilson's aid at the battle
of, Agua Prleta, CarramUtas would
permit the United States to use Mexi
