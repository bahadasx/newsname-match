IN SEARCH OF V
AFTER DEFEAT
Birdmen Seek to Discover
Outlaw After He Leaves
Dead and Wounded Behind
at Namiquipa and Makes
Tracks For the Mountains
BANDIT MAY BREAK
UP HIS COMMAND
Army Officers Agree That if
He Takes Refuge in Sierra
Madre Range With Small
Band It Will Be Practically
Impossible to Capture Him
By Associated Press
El Paso. Texas, March 21. —Avia-
tors of the United States army wort
reported to-dny searching the almost
blind trails leading to the passes in
lhe Sierra Madre mountains where
Francisco Villa may seek to escape
after nis defeat by the Carranza forces j
yesterday at Namiquipa.
Details of the tight in which Colorful j
Cano, with about 900 Carranzistas took;
part, are lacking, but it is reported
that Villa was badly worsted and that
he fled, leaving his dead and wounded.
Captain B. D. Foulois is in charge
of the seven aviators selected for the
task of scouting for Villa who. after i
his fight with Colonel Cano, Is expected :
to scatter his bandits ruther than risk
an engagement with the American 1
troops, who arc said to bar his way
to the north.
Ex|HH't<*(l to Scatter
Army officers agree that if Villa
breaks tip his command into small
bands and turns to the Sierra Madre
mountains for a hiding place, it will
be almost impossible to capture him- j
Villa spent his early days as an out-j
law in these mountains, the passes J
through which an army and its trans-;
port may not move. It takes ten toi
t twelve days to negotiate these passes
® nto the Sonora district.
Mexicans here believe Villa will
hide himself away in the mountain
fastness until the American troops
have given up the chase.
Six Biplanes Join Force
Interest was shown in wireless dis
patches from the front stating that six
biplanes of the First Aero Squadron, j
commanded by Captain Benjamin D.
Foulois. had joined the American ex
peditionary forces.
Henceforth aeroplane scouting is ex
pected here to play an Important part
in the progress of General Pershing's
columns. At E' Valle and Cruces, ac
cording to travelers in the Santa Maris
Valley, there are plenty of locations
suitable for aeroplane bases. From
these points the army airmen are ex
pected to make frequent reconnais
sances over the lofty reaches of the
Sierra Madre range.
If Villa is proceeding in considerable
force, the airmen are likely to locate
him. If he has split up his command
into small units and is keeping under
shelter of the oak and pine woods, the
task of the observers will become diffi
cult.
Will Pick Camp Sites
It is not alone in spying after Villa
forces that the First Squadron will lie
employed. The (lying men are ex
pected to pick out camping places,
watering spots and in some cases path
ways over the mountains which the
mule trains can follow.
No uneasiness is felt here regarding
Lieutenant W. G. Kiiner, who left Co
lumbus in a seventh machine to go to
the front and did not arrive with the
others. The aero squadron undoubt
edly followed the line of communi
cation established by General Pershing
in his southward progress. If Lieu -
lenant Kiiner suffered any mishap and
was compelled to alight, he was almost
certain to be picked up at once by
some outpost, it is believed. Dis
patches arriving from Columbus, N. M.,
say that although it is now more than
ten days since the Villa forces attacked
Columbus*and it has been established
definitely that the bandit is fleeing be
fore the expeditionary force, some of
the residents of the town are not with
out l'ear that the raid may be repeated.
Practically all of the male residents
carry firearms.

When the brick schoolhouse on the
Mesa was opened for the first time
since the raid, a number of the older

By Associated Frcss
London. March 2t. A Renter
dispatch from Teheran says Rus
sian forces entered Ispahan, the
old capital of Persia, on March lit.
Isphan is one of the important cilies
of Persia, with H population of some
80,000. It is 21S miles southeast of
Teheran.
The foregoing dispatch indicates a
Russian movement further to the
south than lias been reported hitherto.
Russian forces after the capture of
Hamadan advanced southwest to
wards Kermanshah, in the direction
of the Turkish frontier. The army
now reported at Ispahan evidently is
striking southward from the main
Russian forces in the direction of the
Persian gulf.
