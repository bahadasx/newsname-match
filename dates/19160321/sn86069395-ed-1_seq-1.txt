SWEEPING
VICTORY
Only Four Precincts Fail To
Line Up For .Good
Roads.
MAJORITY EXCEEDS 3,100
Certainty of Its Adoption
Made The Vote Light For
The Bond Issue.
By a majority in every way credi
table to the enterprise and progress
iveness of the citizenship of the coun
ty, Christian county on Saturday
voted for the proposed good roads
bond issue of S400.0C0 by a majority
of 3,127. Only four precincts out of
32 voted against it and less than 1,500
votes opposed it out of about 6,100.
Tho certainty that the proposition
would carry kept many of its friends
at home, but as it was the majority is
far beyond The old constitutional re
quirement of two-thirds, although the
courts had decided that a two-thirds
majority was not necessary under the
amended constitution.
The result will have a good effect
on bond issues now pending in Todd
and other near by counties. The
good roads movement is sweeping all
Kentucky with increasing enthusiasm,
more than a dozen counties having
recently voted for bonds and many
others have elections coming on.
The returns by precincts from Sat

DR. HARRISON
IS NO MORE1
Aged Scholar Suddenly Called
While on a Visit to
Greensboro.
WAS LOVED BY EVERYONE
Was a Gallant Soldier,
Preacher and an Edu
cator. Rev. Dr. Edmund Harrison, for
thirteen years President of Bethel Fe
male College, died suddenly Sunday
morning at Greensboro, N. C, at the
home of one of his sons. Dr. Harri
son was operated upon last September
for a chronic bladder trouble, his
condition being almost hopeless at
that time, but he recovered and his
health became much better and he
had spent most of the winter in
Greensboro. Recently he had been
troubled with an affection of the heart
and it is supposed this caused his sud-
REV. DR. HARRISON,
den death, as his daughters here had
not been .advised of his illness.
Dr. Harrison. was born in Virginia,
Feb. 17, 1837, and was a little past his
79th year. He served throughout the
war as a Confederate soldier and
adopted teaching as his profession
when peace returned. For many
years he was professor of Latin in
Virginia colleges and was prior to
coming here connected with Richmond
College. He chme to Hopkinsville in
1896 as President of Bethel Female
College and remained until June
1909. During the 13 years he was
here the College enjoyed a standing
for scholarship and a high standard of
merit never surpassed at any time in
its long career. It was noted for its
culture and for its elevated tone of re
finement and Christianity.
Dr. Harrison is survived by his
wife, who was Miss Kate Steger, and
their eight children, four sons and
four daughters, viz: Wm. H. Harri
son, Louisville, Ky.; Jno. S. Harrison,
Richmond, Va.; Dr. Edmund Harri
son and Roger W. Harrison, Greens
boro, N. C; Mrs. J. W. Downer and
Mrs. Thos. S. Knight, of this city, and

of friends here. During the time lid
lived in Hopkinsville he was teacher
of the Men's Bible Class of the First
Baptist church, and a committee was
named by the class Sunday morning
to preparo resolutions of respect to
his mpmnrv
Personally Dr. Harrison was a man
of striking presence. Tall and erect
as an Indian, always a Chesterfield in
courtesy, highly educated and widely
informed on all subjects, ho was a
typical old time Virginia gentleman.

EAST FRONT
Fighting Around Verdun Has?
Become Much Less
Severe.
FRENCH TORPEDO SUNK
Aviators Drop Bombs on. Ger
man Trenches and Depots
Near St. Mihiel.
With the slackening of tho fighting:
around Verdun, the Russians- have
started a big offensive movement
against the Germans on the eastern
front. A raid by German seaplanes" on tfie"
cast coast of England and by French
airmen on Mctzand other German
towns, the sinking of a French torpe
do boat destroyer by a submarine in
the Adriatic and the reported toriwdo
ing of an Austrian hospital ship by an
entente under-water boat are record
ed in official and unofficial communi
cations. Berlin chronicles an attack of great
violence by the Russians around Dris
wiaty lake and Lake Narocz, but says
the Russians were repulsed with
great losses, 9,270 Russian dead liav
ing been counted in the Lake Narocx
region.
Saturday the Germans in the Vaux
Damloup sector, northeast of Verdun,
began another spirited attack against
the French, but the French, bringing
their curtain of fire into play, drovo
tie Teutons back. The attack was not
pushed again during Sunday, and
only intermittent bombardments took
place.
Five French aircraft dropped bombs
on Metz, ammunition depots near
Chateau Salins and the aerodrome at
Dieuze, while twenty-three other ma
chines attacked the aviation camp at
Habsheim and the freight station at
Mulhausen. In battles in the air
which followed, the Germans and the
French each lost three or four ma
chines. A German airship attacked
the entente allied fleet south of Salon-
iki, but with what result Berlin does
not say.
The officers and forty-four men of
the crew of the French torpedo boat
destroyer Tenaudin were lost when a
Teutonic submarine sent the vessel to
the bottom in the Adriatic.
In a raid by four German seaplanes
over Dover, Rimsgate and Westgatc
at least nine persons were killed and
thirty-one injured. One of the sea
planes was brought down thirty miles
at sea by a pursuing British aviator
The German observer was killed.
The German admiralty officially de
