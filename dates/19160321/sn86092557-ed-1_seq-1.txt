(By Associated Press)
WHEELING. W. Va., March 21?
Thomas Deflnbaugh. aged 12, and
George Howe, aged 14. were playing
at border -warfare yesterday when
Definbaugh was capturcd by Howe
and tied to a tree.
Howe, is is alleged, then secured
a rifle of small calibre and fired
at his captive, the bullet striking
blm Just below tho heart.
He is in a hospital and pbysiclans
say lie cannot recover.
which American troops were advanc
ing last night.
The outcome of tho engagement had
not been reported by General Per
shing and General Funston expected
to get his first news from Mexico
sources.
The latest official repor showed the
three detachments of General Per
shing's force riding hard Into the
south. The prospect for at least one
of them to get Into contact with Vili
la appeared bright.
Along the line of communication and
at Casas Grandes enough troops have
been held to furnish a supporting
force to any of the three columns. It
was believed likely hero that aero
planes would be above Villa and would
be able to keep General Pershing in
formed of his new route If he man
aged to extricate himself from his en
counter with the Carranza soldiers.
Failure to secure Immediate per
mission to send supplies over the
Northwestern railroad caused head
quarters today to continue to route
supplies to Columbus for transporta
tion to Casas Grandes by automobile
truck.
Mapping Out Great
White Way Lights
The points at which tho new Main
street Great "White Way lights are to
be placed are baing selected this week.
The signer? of the light request are
anxiously waiting for the more tardy
ones to sign, after which the lights
will be placed on the Main street,
greatly improving conditions on that
thoroughfare.
Thero seems to tv. the commission
ers claim, quite a little ill feeling in
some quarters as to who should have
the lights in front of their stores. The
surveyors working today will select
the best position in their opinion and
all complaints will bo referred to the
streat commissioner later.

DECLARED VALID
Motion to Quash the New
Indictments Was Over
ruled.
The motion to quasli the new In
dictments against James D. Linn and
Less G. Race was overruled this morn
ing by Judge Haymond ot the Circuit
Court. This motion was argued last
evening before tho court. Attorneys
Jamos A. Meredith and W S. Meredith
representing the defendants and Pros
ecuting Attorney Haggerty for the
state being assisted by Tusca Morris.
Tho motion to quash was on the
ground that the Joining of tho words
embezzclrnent, misapplied, abstrac
tion and misplaced, la the indictment
was an error. The Judge went to con
siderable length in explaining the rea
sons for his decision and cited a num
ber ot statues and precedents where
by the spirit and meaning of the law
should govern rather than to follow
the letter which In this instance would
be an absurdity.
Tho prosecuting attorney filed the
bill of particulars in tne cases against
Ltbn and Race this afternoon at 2:30
o'clock. The defense was allowed the
privilege of examining these until to
morrow morning when it Is likoly that
the defense will ask to have the case
continued. Should (heir motion to
continue be overruled the case may.
bfi tried at once:
S. \V. Shrader. who was Indicted In
connection with Howard;W. Showalter
appeared in court yesterday evening
and the motion of his attorneys to
quash the Indictment against him be
ing overruled, gave bond in the sum
ot $1,000, and the dato of his trial was
fixed for April 3.
The trial of Howard W. Showalter
will probably be hcldat the same time,
James B. Ice,.the B. & O. officer who
was Indicted for assaulting Charton
Cumpston confessed to the charge of
assault provided he would .not be pros
ccuted for felony. Oumpston appeared
in court this morning and wben ques
tioned by .the Judge appeared to have
but a faint' recollection of the affair.
He could- not remember much about
it except that. Ice had struck'liim over
