of six months by A u -1 ro-H ungarian
troops, IVrici zkd, on the Lneister
river, north of 'zcrnowitz, has been
captured by the IlUsians. it was ad

point.
The Austro-Hungarian commander
evacuated the forts northwest of the
town to avoid useless losses from
the Russian artillery which was
carrying out a violent bombardment
of the place.
The attack on Fsoieczko was part
of the general drive by the Russians
on the southern part of the battle

up a path through Rukowina.

SAN ANTONIO, Texas, March 21.
Maj. Gen. Funston is now hopeful
that the pursuit of Francisco Villa
will reach a successful conclusion
much sooner than has been expected
when Gen. Pershing's expedition
crossed the border. Villa's destruc
tion would be assured, according to
the military olhcials here if Gen.
Carranza would grant American
troops the privilege of using Mexican
railways. Gen. Funston Is hopeful
that the lirst chief will s-oon act on
the American government's request.
Funstcn is anxious that the Amer
ican troops' task be completed at
the earliest possible moment, for
two reasons:
First, the agreement between the
American and Mexican government
is said to provide that the American
troops hall be withdrawn from
Mexico if Villa's trail is lost.
Second, it is ditlicult to make the
American soldiers obey all the regu
lations necessary to prevent sick
ness. Typhus fever is raging south
of the border. Typhoid is also a
peril, pure drinking water being al
most unobt.iinable.
Gen, Funston announced today
that the censorship which has hid
den the military movements along
the border would be greatly modi
tied. "There is no need for the strictest
censorship now," lie said. "Villa is
fo far south of the border that
the American newspapers cannot
reach h:m. I have directed Gen.
Pershing by wireless to give the
correspondents more liberty and fa
cilities." lilTV LOXC; RLPOUT.

reviewing the general situation
