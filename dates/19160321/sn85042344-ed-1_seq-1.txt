Associated Press Obtains Reports
From a "Source That Is
Unimpeachable"
EL PASO, March 20. Jn spite of reports that the Car
ranza forces had eiiRaged Villa's men at Xamiquipa,
there seems to be a feeling here that the Carranza forces
, have iaileu to hold their end or the net closing about the
; bandit chief. There were confirmatory reports received
) today of the news of the last week that the Mexican
Jroops were not only failing to co-operate with the Amci
lcan troops, but in certain instances at least were ac
tuallv withdrawing from the field of operations,
i The Associated Press learned on unquestionable
?; authority that the troops of the de facto government
which have been stationed at Casas Grandes have been
withdrawn and are now in and about Juarez. From the
same source it was learned that at least one detachment
'i of Carranza troops had refused to fight Villa and had
withdrawn on the bandit's appearance, leaving him free
to pass.
This detachment withdrew on receipt of a message
v tyat he was warring not on Mexicans but the enemies of
Mexicans.
Villa is Cornered.
The extraordinary rapidity, with which the Ameri
can cavalry had pushed into Mexico gave rise to high
hopes yesterday that the unexpected had happened and
the notorious bandit was cornered. This seemed inevita
ble ii4 the Carranza soldiers did their part and if the ac
count of the strength of their field forces was correct.
Villa cut off from the north by the forward sweep
of the American columns, from the west by the Sierra
Madre, barring the approaches to the state of Sonora,
p was supposed to be equally
y powerful Carranza forces,
What General Gavira Said.
It now seems certain that Villa has been moving
i frroly in at le.ist a large section of
S- the country supposed to be held by
'- the troops of the first chief. In the
Z lost few days he has been variously
it reported by General Oavlra, the Car
1 ranza commadner at Juarez, at points
' along a line reaching north and south
'from Gnleana to Nnmlnuipu. a dis
tance of about 75 mites. By the same
.accounts ho has not been moving
'. ; stendlly south, but roving north and
. The character of the mountainous,
canyon-split, roadless section in which
' he is operating adds many miles to
'j ' the country he has covered, as com
$, ' j ared to the distances on the map.

SAN ANTONIO. Texas, March 20.
Francisco Villa may be forced into a
fight with the American troops within
the next 86 hours If reports coming
to General Funston's . headquarters
both from General Pershing and from
Mexican sources aro correct. General
1'ershing reported today that Villa had
Ifeen rejiorted defeated bv Mexican
government troops near Cruces and
that he was marching northward, in
retrent. General Pershing's report
was followed, however, by the unoffi
cial report that Villa was still fighting
at Numl'iuipa, south of Cruces.
If the Carranza force wins in the
fight that was said to be continuing
today, Villa will have to move north
ward along a road over which a de
'tachmcnt of American troops is riding
southward, or leave the road and head
for the Canta Maria mountains that
parallel the road to the east, or to the
Oriental range on the west side. Re

practicable because of the presence In

Washington Says De Facto
Troops Are Co-operating
With Pershing.
WASHINGTON, March 20. Tho
de factor goyernmenjt of Mexico
today proposed to the United States
tho drafting of a protocol under
which American and Mexican troops
may co-operate in running to earth
Francisco Villa and his bandits with
out liunirer of misunderstanding or
conflict. Tho terms of such a formal
convention would bo designed to meet
all questions which may arise in tho
future, setting forth the rights of the
American expeditionary forces now
in pursuit of the bandit chieftain and
the nature of the co-operation ex
pected from the troops of tho Car
ranza government. These facts be
came known today at the conclusion
of a conference between Klisoo Ar
rcdondo, Mexican ambassador-designate,
and Asting Secretary Polk of the
stato department. Negotiations on
tho details will bo In progress several
days, but the two governments ure in
agreement on tho general principals
Involved.
Working Together.
Meanwhile, however, the troops of
the de facto government actually are
co-operating with the American forces
nnd ucocnling to Information re
ceived by tho war department, are
planning to render even greater as
sistance. High military officials al
lowed it to become known that the
Curranza government had promised
to move a large force of its troops
from central Mexico to tho north,
forming a trap Into which tho Ameri
can cavalrymen under General Persh
ing may chase Villa und his followers.
I. W. W.'s Cause Trouble.
During the day disturbing reports
came to tho war department from
General Funston regardging condi
tions at Nogales, Sonora. There, an
official dispatch said, members of the
Industrial Workers of the World
were engaged In making incendiary
anarchistic speeches to Htir the Mex
ican population to rash acts. The
speakers, according to the dispatches,
are believed to have crossed the bor
der from the United States. The In
formation was turned over to the
state department, which will advise
the do facto government of tho condi
tions in Nogales.

OKLAHOMA CITY. Okla., March
20. Interest in the liepubllcan

nlKht by the result of the sixth district
congressional convention held today at
Kl ltono, which broke, up umbl the
wildest confusion after the Harris
supporters hud trumped up u contest

The convention broke np In a row
after a practically all day session
with both side electing delegates to
the national convention.
Harris headquarters gave out tho
report that contests in tho state con
vention would be tiled from Tulsa, and
many other counties instructed for
McGraw but tho McGraw supporters
ere conmlcnt that these contests will
be thrown out and that they will
have a good working majority of from
CUO to TOO when the state convention
meets Wednesday morning.
Pursuing tho tactics nt' the Repub

ainl his followers arc Instituting con

Seminole counties in tho hope of fin

MR. HARRIS'
The World Is convinced that the fight which it helped to make against
the leadership of Jim Harris in the Republican party in Oklahoma has been
won beyond the question of a doubt in tho county convci.tions throughout
the state which were held last Saturday and that this work will be com
pleted In the state convention at Oklahoma City tomorrow by the selection
of James J. McGraw aa national committeeman from this state for the
ensuing four years. The World Is proud of the outcome of this contest
and It la confident that not only the result, but tho contest Itself will prove
one of the best things that his ever occurred in and for the Republican
paty of this state.
When the stute convention is over and Mr. McGraw Is elected we think
that ought to bo final and that Mr. Harris should drop his fight then and
there aa Mr. McGraw most purely would do if the convention decided
against him. We are certain that every sincere Republican In the state
feels exactly the samo way about It. Mr. Harris Is apparently not so dis
posed and this furnishes the best possible argument against him that could
be presented. Hut the best and strongest of all arguments In addition to
this against Mr. Harris waa presented by himself In the various county
