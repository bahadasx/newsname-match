aviators. It Is expected that Villa scattered bis bandits rather than
run the risk of an engagement with the Americans. The army om- w.

hides in the Sierra Madres, it will be well nigh Impossible to capture
him.

UP TO THE SCHOOL AUTHOR

THOD OF PROCEDURE
Editor Bonanza, Sir: The Reno
Gazette makes much of the fact that
the Tonopah girls have not protested
the game played in Reno. It Is due
the girls as well as the people of
Tonopah to state that the girls do not
feel that it Is for them to decide
whether or not to protest the game
They are only representatives of the
Tonopah high school and they feel it
is a matter to be decided by the school
authorities. They certainly have
abundant grounds on which to base
a protest if the authorities decide the
game is worth the candle. A careful-
statements of the facts In the case
made by the team coach, and specta
tors, together with a citation to the
numerous rules violated is ' being
prepared for the use of the school
authorities. After giving the case
careful consideration it will be for
the school authorities to decide what
action should be taken.
It certainly should not be necessary
to protest a game as farcical as this
game apparently was.
One would suppose the board of
control of the inter-scholastic league
and the Reno school authorities would
wish to show the whole state a stand

selves calling the game void.

Of all the happy events of tbla

Tonopah schools, today has certainly
been the happiest. The cause? Wby
the appearance on the play grounds
today of the new patent athletic
slides purchased by the Tonopah Wo
man's club. This forenoon a squad
of eighth grade boys under the direc
tion of Superintendent Dllworth put
the apparatus together and set up
one slide at each end of the high
school building with the lower end
of each slide terminating in a bed
of sand. During the noon hour and
the recess periods the children lined
up In lines of between 200 and 300
to take their turns on the slides.
Dozens of passersby stopped to note
the unadulterated joy of the children.
Shortly after twelve one of the
Bonanza office force heard a small
boy rushing Into his home shouting.
"Oh, mamma, mamma, mamma, give
me a piece of bread and butter for my
lunch, quick! They have the slide
put up at the school house and I must
hurry right back."
