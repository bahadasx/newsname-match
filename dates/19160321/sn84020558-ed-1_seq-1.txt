WASHINGTON. March 20. By" re
fusing definitely to increase the reg
ular army provision of the Hay hill,
the house today made it almost cer
tain that the measure will go to the
senate originally as framed and by a
overwhelming vote. Chairman Hay of
the military committee was hopeful
tonight that a final vote could be
reached tomorrow.
The net result of the day's debate
on proposed amendments was to sus
tain the recommendation of the pres
ident as to the size of the regular army
The Hay bill carries virtually the pro
giam mapped out by Former Secre
tary Garrison in this regard, but sub
stitutes the federalization of the na
tional guard for the continental army.
The president has approved its gener
al outline, but stands uncommitted as
to details.
Three times during the day the house
defeated proposals to increase the
peace strength of the regulars, fixed
by the Hay bill at H0.OO0, expandable
to lTTi.Ouo by executive order if war is
imminent. The debate centered upon
the Kahn amendment to fix the au
thorized peace strength at 220,000, but
the first vote was on a substitute of
fered by Representative Fuller, repub
lican of Illinois, to make it 250,000.
The Fuller amendment was lost
without a division. The Kahn amend
ment was voted down 183 to 103, after
appeals for a larger standing army had
been made by Representative Mann,
republican leader, and other influen
tial members of the minority.
Only two democrats supported the
Kahn amendment in debate and less
than a dozen voted for it. About
forty republicans voted against it.
Representative Crago, republican, of
the military committee, proposed to fix
the strength at 200,000 but was voted
down by a substantial majority.
With the outstanding feature dis
posed of, consideration of the re
mainder of the bill went forward rap
idly. About one-third of the measure
had been reviewed and approved when
adjournment for the day came. The
national guard, industrial reserve and
nitrate plant sections are among those
still to be considered.
When the measure reaches the sen
ate it is possible that all but the en
acting clause will be stricken out and
(he senate committee measure substi
tuted as a short cut to conference. The
final measure must be written in con
ference as senate and house propos
als differ radically. Should the senate
committee work out a combiantion of
its own measure with the house bill,
however, it appears likely that the na
tional guard, industrial reserve and ni
trate plant proposals of the Hay bill
will be retained, while the senate's fig
ures of ITS, 000 peace strentgh for the
regular army will be inserted with the
senate plan for creation of a third
force of federal volunteers. The house
bill contains an authorization for
summer training camps, while the sen
ate bill proposes the establishment of a
force of 261,000 federal volunteers,
grouped hy congressional districts.
While all house members present who
oppose anv preparedness measures
whatever, voted against the Kahn
amendment, there were others on both
sides, who, though favoring larger pro
portions for the standing army, re
fused to support the amendment be
cause the bill figures represent the

CHICAGO, March 20. After devot
ing several hours to discussing the
(nullifications of numerous candidates
for temporary chairman of the re
publican national convention to be
held in Chicago June 7, the sub-committee
on arrangements of the na
tional committee today was unable
to reach a decision and deferred ac
tion until tomorrow. If the members
are unable to agree at tomorrow's
session the subject will go over until
the next meeting April 20.
Among the names suggested for
temporary chairman wore:
Senator Warren (J. Harding of Ohio,
President Nicholas Murray Butler of
Columbia university, Xew York; Phil
ander C. Knox, of Pennsylvania, Sen
ator W. K. P.orah of Idaho, Governor
Samuel A. McCall of Massachusetts:
Senator Henry C. Lodge of Massa-1

Oshorne of Michigan, Senator George
Sutherland of I'tah and W. J. Cal
houn of Illinois.
Senator Harding of Ohio, it is said,
was regarded with more favor than
the others in the preliminary dis
cussion the arguument being used that
he would be acceptable to both the
stalwart and progressive factions of
the party. The same argument was
used in support of P. C. Knox. At
the close of the discussion the indica
tions were that the choice might be
between Harding, ,'iutler and Knox.
Although ..Chairman Charles 1).

candidates further than to reiterate

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
Heavy-battles have been in progress
northwest and northeast of Verdun,
and on the northern part of the Rus
sian front, where the Russians are
keeping up their strong offensive
against the Germans. In all these
zones the losses have been large,
while the changes in positions Have
been relatively unimportant.
Northwest of Verdun in the sector
of Avocnurt-Malaneoiirt, the Germans,
after a terrific bombardment, made a
vicious infantry attack in which liquid
fire was employed against the French
front. A fresh German division
brought up from a remote point par
ticioated in the operation. The French,
however, put down the attack with
heavy casualties to the assaulting
forces except in the western part of
the M.ilancourt wood, some miles from
Verdun, when the Germans made
slight progress.
Berlin reports the repulse, also with
heavy losses, of the French who at
tacked the illagc of Vaux. northeast
of Verdun. Elsewhere around the
fortress there have been only inter
mittent iHimbardments and a contin
uation of fights in the air between
French and Herman aviators.
Although Rerlin claims that the
Germans again have repulsed the
Russians in lepeated attacks with
strong fcrces around Postavy arid be
tween Lakes Narocz and Dreswiaty,
Petrograd reports a German ch'ck
south of Rake Dreswiaty and the cap
ture of German trenches in the lake
Narocz region. Several villages in
this district also have been taken by
the Russians.
In Galicia the Russians have cap
tured Austrian trenches and a bridge
head east of the village of iik
hamtche. There also has been consid
erable fighting between the Austrians
and Russians along the Dniester and
P.essarabian fronts.
On the Isonzo line the Italians have
recaptured trenches from the Aus
trians on Santa Maria hefghts. Later,
after having stopped Austrians coun
ter attacks, the Italians retired to
another position, from a portion of
their advanced line, in order to avoid
being enfili lated by fresh Austrian
batteries. Artillery engagements have
been in progress on the remainder of
the Austro-Italian front.
The Russians continue their pur
suit of the Turks in the Caucasus
reaion and have taken additional pris
oners and guns. An attempt by the
Turks to advance in the Illaok sea
litti ral was stopped by Russian naval
and land guns.

It was said that the investigation
showed "a far-reaching and gigantic

the alleged frauds, they intimated that
the offenders were not confined to the

setting lortli the rights ot the Amer
ican expeditionary forces now in pur
suit of the bandit chieftain and the
nature of the co-operation expected
from the troops of the Carranza gov-
rnment. These fai ls became known
at the con ausion ol a conterenee be
tween Fdiseo Arredondo, Mexican am-
lassador-designate, and acting Secre
ary Polk of the state department.
Negotiations on the details will be in
rogress for several days, but the two
o eminent are in agreement on the
eneral principles involved.
.Meanwhile, however, the troops of
the ile facto government actually are
co-operating with the American forc
es and according to information re
ceived by the war department, are
-landing to rendf r even greater as
sistance. High military officials nl-
iv.ed it to become known that the
'a-ranza government had promised to
move a large force of its troops from
entral Mexico to the north forming j
trap into which the American cav
alrymen under General Pershing may j
hase Villa and his followers.
During the day disturbing reports
ame to the war department from
General Funstoti regarding conditions
it Nogales, Sonora. There, an official
lispatch said, members of the Indus
trial Workers of the World were en
gaged in making incendiary anar
chistic speeches to stir the Mexican
population to rash acts. The speak
ers, according to the dispatch, are be
lieved to have crossed the border from
th I'nited States. The information
was turned over to the state depart
ment, which will advise the de facto
government of the conditions in No-
gales.
General Pershing, in a delayed dis
'.atch which reached the war depart
ment late in the day reported that

isr 200 men. This count includfs
killed and wounded, and men wtio
deserted during the flight from Co
lumbus.
Proposal for the protocol, which it
planned to have remain in force
until Villa is captured, came from Mr.
Arredondo and was a direct result of
the request of the I'nited States for
permission tn use the railway from
Kl Paso and Casas Grandes for the
shipment of supplies to the American
expeditionary-forces. Mr. Arredondo
is understood to have received in
structions from General Cirranza to
discuss the request with the state de
partment and to propi se the agree
ment by which a complete under
standing will be bad by both govern
ments. While the convention will provide
for all matters such as the use of
Mexican railroads by American troops
the srecilic request for permission to
ship supplies from El Paso will be
disposed of separately. General Car
ranza has asked for additional infor
mation upon that subject and it will
be forwarded to him immediately.

ALLOWED VILLA CHANCE
TO SLIP THROUGH NET
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
KL PASO, Tex. Mnivh 20 -The
Carranza fonts have failed to hold
their end of the net that was closing
about Paiubo Villa and the
chief has escaped to bis m
haunU
reliabl
aboul Guerrero, according to
information received here to-
day.
The escape of the bandit, is, how
ever, far from being the most serious
item of news which reached the bor
der today. A feature of the gravest,
importance was injected into the situ
ation by substantial confirmation of;
the nunier.ius reports received for i
the past week that ihe .Mexican gov- j
ernment troops were not only failing'
to co-operate with the American'
troops, but ill certain instances at :
least, were actually w ithdrawing from '
Ihe field of operations.
The Associated press, learned on;
unquestionable authority that the
troops of the re facto government !
w hich had been stationed at Casa '
Grandes have been withdrawn and:
are now in and about Jaurez. From
the same source it was learned that
it least one detachment of Carranza (
troops had refused to fight Villa and
bad withdrawn on the bandit's ap
proach, leaving him free to pass into
his favorite mountain fast nessess in
tlie great continental divide south of
Xamiquipa. This detachment with
drew on receipt of a message that
be was warring nut on Mexicans but
the enemies of Mexicans.
The extraordinary raoiditv with
! which the American cavalry had
pushed into Mexico gave rise to high
hopes yesterday that the unexpected
had happened and the notorious ban
dit was cornered. This seemed in
evitable if the Carranza soldiers did
.heir part and if the estimate of the
strength of their field forces was
correct. Villa, cut off from the north
by the forward sweep of the Ameri-
an columns, from the west by the
Sierra Madre barring the approaches
the state of Sonora, was supposed
to be equally barred from east and
nth by powerful Carranza forces.
Those hopes have been completely
dashed bv todav's developments.
More than this it now seems certain
that Villa is moving freely in at
least a large section of the country
supposed to be held by the troops
of the first chief. In the last few
days he has been variously reported
by General Gavira, the Carranza I
commander at Jaurez, at points

to be fleeing, as the city man knows

of the frontier, heavily roweled spurs,
and with little wrinkles at the corners
of their eyes, bespeaking lives spent in
the open, these scouts form what is
said to be the most picturesque group
of men in the expeditionary force.
Military men frankly admit that upon
their knowledge of the district in w hich
Villa is reported fleeing, rests much of
the hoie for the capture of the bandit.
It is these volunteers, many of whom
Villa drove from their homes and their
property in Mexico, that are leading the
American columns to the water holes

presence of American soldiers on
Mexican railroads could not fail to

it is feared, would be sure to provoke

iin the other hand there are many

American military authorities to ship

At the present time these supplies
must go forward, over a desert and

The pressure is intensified by the fact
that almost all the forage for the
