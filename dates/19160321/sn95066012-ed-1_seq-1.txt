OPPOSE BIG ARMY
Kahn Amendment Calling for 220,000
Men Defeated.
Washington, March 20. After a
spirited debate the House today thrice
went on record against a large stand
ing army. This seems to assure the
passage without material amendment
of the Hay bill for an army of 140,000
men and the federalization of the mili
tia. The Kahn amendment, proposing an
army of 220,000 men, was defeated 183
to 103. A majority of the republicans
voted for the amendment and a large
majority of the Democrats against it,
but party lines were not closely fol
lowed. No roll call was taken, as the
bill was being considered in Committ
ee of the Whole. It is understood
that at a late stage Mr. Kahn will re
vive his amendment.
Prior to the vote on the Kahn amend
ment about which the debate centered
the House defeated on a viva voce
vote a motion by Representative Chas.
E. Fuller of Illinois, a Republican, to
authorize an army of 20,000 men. Sub
sequently Representative Thomas S.
Crago of Pennsylvania, a Republican,
sought to put through a compromise
plan for a larger army. He proposed
unit tiu.umi men ne enlisted ror one
year, with a proviso that they then go
into a reserve for six ' years. This
amendment was defeated 134 to 82.

Annual Meeting For Inst uction at
Court House Today
Ml PLUMLEY EXPLAINS LAWS
Goes Into Details Over Offset Amend
ment Enacted by Last
Legislature.
Bennington county listers met at
the county court house at 1 o clock
this afternoon for their annual confer
ence with Tax Commissioner Charles
A. Plumley of Northf.eld. , in his in
structions the commissioner said that
the ofllco of lister requires the exer
cise of good judgment and impartiali
ty; that the lister is pre-eminently the
most Important oflicial in the whole
scheme of general property taxation.
Every effort to better the system
should be concentrated upon him and
his work. The law prescribed the
standard ot value, the plan to be fol
lowed, and the lister is armed and
equipped as the law directs. He does
not make, and is not responsible for
but he has taken au oath to enforce
the law. if a law is not right, is In
equitable, or unjust, the surest way to
have such a law corrected is to en
force it Impartially. It is the duty of
the Hater to see that he who has been
paying too much should pay less, and
he who has been paying too little shall
pay his full share.
He emphasized the fact that a 5 per
cent indebtedness does not entitle a
man to claim the benefit of an offset,
that it Is only indebtedness on which
G per cent or over is paid that en
titles the taxpayer to an offset. He
distributed illustrative examples which
he had worked out In detail covering
the matter of offsets involving the par
tioular problems which the listers
will be apt to encounter In their work.
These examples are lmsed upon sec
tion 4 of No. 34 of the acts of 1915,
ind will simplify the work o' the list
ers if they aro followed.,. ,. ,k
Incidentally, Mr. Plumley distributed
bulletin showing the, number, pf jefl
ilers' licenses, now"., issued1 In the
state, the law relating to the licensing
of peddlers and the disposition which
Is made of the fees received from the
jcensing of peddlers. The fees are dis
M-ibuted among the various towns "for
the purpose of equalizing opportunities
tn the public educational system." It
's apparent from an examination of
this schedule and from one's . know
ledge of conditions as they exist that
a large number of peddlers are not
licensed as required by law.
Mr. Plumley referred to bulletin
No. 7, which he has recently distribut
ed to liBters, town clerks and others
throughout the state, and called atten
tion to certain typographical errors In
that bulletin, paying particular atten
tion to page 25, lines 22 and 23. He
said that the words "sub-division (b)
ot section 3" should be struck out, and
Miat the words "section 4" should be
'nserted in lieu thereof. The context
discloses that this is a typograptlcal
error, but in order that there may bo
no confusion, Mr. Plumley has dis
tributed "Iirrata" slips calling atten
tion to these matters. For the benefit
of the newly elected listers, he dis
cussed the changes in tax laws made
by tho legislatures of 1008, 1010, 1012
and 1915. He referred to No. 43 of the
laws of 1915, which facilitates the col:
lection of poll taxes, and to No. 54 of
the acts of 1915, which provides for the
appointment of a limited number of
special deputies to determine the
valuation of power plants, mills, dams
and other special forms of taxable
property.

TO PRESIDE AT CHICAGO
G. O. P National Committee Trying to
Select a Chairman.
cnicago, warcn zu. selection or a
a temporary chairman for the Republi
can national convention, which meets
here in June, was the problem faced
by the members of the Republican na
tional subcommittee on convention ar
rangements here today.
With the exception of E. S. Duncan
of North Carolina, every( member of
the subcommittee was present when
Charles D. Hilles of New York, chair
man, rapped for order. .
Franklin Murphy of New Jersey
brought word of the. elimination of
Elihu Root of New York from the tem
porary chali man contest. He said:
"Mr. Root has stated positively that
he would not attend the convention."
Chairman Hilles declined to discuss
presidential possibilities. He said an
effort would be made to have the con
vention go on record as favoring a
uniform presidential primary law.
Before tho session began Ralph Wil
liams of Oregon said the Republicans
In Oregon regarded Justice Charles E.
Hughes of the Supreme Court as the
best compromise presidential candi j
date. "I do not thlrk," said Williams,
"that the leaders regard Colonel Roose
velt seriously as a candidate."
Candidates for the temporary' chair
mauship, whose names appeared in the
discussion were: Senator W. E. Borah
of Idaho, Senator Henry C. Lodge of
Massachusetts, former Governor Chase
S. Osborn of Michigan, Governor S. A
McCall of Massachusetts and P. C.
Knox of Pennsylvania.
When the selection of a temporary
chairman was taken up in executive
session, late today, two new candidates
were considered, Senator Warren G
Harding of Ohio and Nicholas Murray
Butler, president of Columbia univer
sity, New York.
senator naramg was regarded as
the favorite. Chairman Charles D,
Hilles presented a detailed statement
advocating the unification of the varl
ous state presidential primary laws
Franklin Murphy said he did not
think Colonel Roosevelt would be serl
ously considered by the convention as
a presidential candidate. Elihu Root
he said, was the "ideal candidate."
"The wisest leaders of the party,
said Murphy, "seem to think that Co
onel Roosevelt could not be elected tf
he was nominated. He Is stronger in
the west than in the east."

CARRANZA'S HEfi
Iff CLASH
WITH VILLA
Bandit Has Sought Rete in Santa
Clara Mountians
AMERICAN AVIATOR INJURED
Lieut. Samuel Bowen Falls While
Scouting for Gen. Pershing In
Mexico.
El Paso, Tex., March 21. Gen. Per
shing reported by wireless to his buso
at Columbus, N. M today that Villista
forces hud been severely worsted in a
battle with Carranza troops and that
Villa had retreated into the Santa
Clara Mountains.
Lieut. Samuel Boweu of the aviation
corps was Injured yesterday when bis
machine fell somewhere in Mexico
while he was scouting for the
Pershing expedition.
San Antonio, Texas, March 20.
Francisco Villa may be forced into the
fight with American trroops within tho
next thirty-six hours if reports to Gen
eral Funston's headquarters here both
from General Pershing and from Mexi
can sources are correct.
General Pershing reported today
that Villa had been reported defeated
by Mexican Government troops near
Cruces and that he was inarrhin
northward iu retreat. His report,
however, was followed by the unollkial
statement that Villa still was fighting
at Natniquipa, south of Cruces.
If the Carranza force wins in tho
fighting that was said to be continu
Ing late today, Villa will have to move
northward along a road over which
a detachment of American troops is
riding southward, or leave the road
and head for the Santa Maria Moun
tains, that parallel tho road to the
east, or to the Oriental Range on the
west side. Retreat, according to the
report, is impracticable because of the
presence in the rear of Mexican troops
who forced him to turn northward
from Cruces.-. - . .
El Paso, Tex... March 20. The forces
of Colonel Cano.' were engaged ill bat
tle at' 4.'J0 o'clock t'hla afternoon with
bariditi led by Villa in Narhiqulpa, ac
cording to a 'dispatch received this af
ternoon by General Gavira, Carranaa
commander at Juarez."' The result of
the fighting was not decided at tht
time of the dispatch. Nainlqulpa Is Uie
district of Guerrero, state of Chihua
hua. . ;
Colonel Cano is in command ot 90
cavalry which came in contact two
days ago at El Valle with Villa forces
which on that occasion fled without
giving battle.
Despite reports that General Cano
had engaged those of Villa at Nami
qulpa, persons well informed here ex
pressed the opinion the Carranza
forces had failed to keep up their end
of the net by which it was proposed to
capture the bandit chlcftan. There
were confirmatory reports today of the
news received for the last week that
the Mexican troops not only failed to
co-operate with the American troops
but in certain instances at least actual
ly were withdrawing from th'o field of
operation.
It has been learned on unquestion
able authority that the troops of the
de facto government which had bcrn
stationed at Casas Grandes have been
'withdrawn' and are now In and about
Juarez. From the same source it was
learned that at least one detachment
of Carranza troops had refused to fight
Villa and hnd withdrawn on the
bandit's approach, leaving free to pass
Into his favorite mountain fastness,
This detachment withdrew on receipt
of a message that he was warring not
on Mexicans, but on the enemies of
Mexicans.
The extraordinary rapidity with
which the American cavalry had
pushed into Mexico gave rise to high
hope yesterday that tho notorious
bandit was cornered. This seemed in
evitable if the Carranza soldiers did
their part and if the account of the
strength of their field forces was cor
rect.
Villa, cut off from the north bv the
forward sweep of the American
columns, from the west by the Sierra
Madere barring the approaches to the
state of .Sonora, was supposed to be
equally barred from the east and
south by powerful Carranza forces.
It now seems certain that Villa has
been moving freely in at least a lar,:;e
part of the country supposed to be
held by the troops of the first chief.
