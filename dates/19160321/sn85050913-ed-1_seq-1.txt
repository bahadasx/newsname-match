the cities. Aquatic sports have nev
er grown old to young or old, and
few are the people who can resist
the lure of the water, ejther in the
glare of the noonday sun, or under
the spell of moonlight. Here is- a
good opportunity for. churches, com
mercial league and private donors'to
put in real missionary work, for the
only way to keep our young people
at home and in the right road is to
give, them something to do and a
real pla,ce to play.
The park commission' Is now pre
pared to receive bids for park privi
leges for the summer consisting' of
merry-go-rounds, ice cream, candy,
lunch counters, boat house with
boats to let, bath house and bathing
suits. Arrangements may also be
made with the commission by private
parties 'desiring to keep their own
boat on the river in the park and
some provisions made whereby they
may rent storehouse room during the
summer.
With proper concessions in this
park, properly policed, there will be
automobile loads every evening, as
well as during the day time, from
towns far distant who will have
come to enjoy these park privileges.
All summer long, last year, there
were from two to five picnic parties
at a time in progress In Nokomis
park where benches and tables are
provided. /t ..
The scenery1'along the river as it
winds about the golf links of the
Outing club is of exceptional beauty

the deal which- took sagacious finan
ciering to bring it to .a consumma
tion.
Not since the days of S. B. Itosen
krans has there bepn anything like a
river park the present commissioners
propose to establish and keep. Mr.
Rosenkrans, about twenty-six or sev
en, years ago, beautified and improv
ed a strip of river bank just across
Bank street bridge, where perhaps
one of the most picturesque spots in
the state, was the result of his lab
ors. Mineral /springs, shell edged
walks, fountains, aquariums, a small
zoological garden, swings, seats,
etc., were in the upper and lower
parts of the hilly river bank, while
boats upon the river plied up and
down on hot days and lazy summer
afternoons and the one spot where
young and old wished "to go, was
Rosenkrans park. This was mostly
at the owner's expense and
when it was completed and h6 wish
ed to sell the same to the city for a
permanent park, -those short sight
ed ones turned down the proposition.

Watching Webster* City.
Evidence that Fort Dodge Is
watching^ Webster City in the mat
ter of improvement and up to date
equipment is shown in the incident
of their recent purchase of a lung
motor 'for that city. The appliance
was purchased by the Gas & Electric
company and turned over to the fire
department for city use. it may
only be operated by the firemen, doc
tors and police department—a dis
tinct disadvantage as compared tc
the life motor possessed by \Veb3ter
City, which may be safely operated
by a ten year old child. Further
more* the life saving apparatus in
this city belongs entirely to the city
and not to any company or individ

TWENTY PATIENTS
TO E
New Connty Farm Hou$e Adequate
—Thirty-Nine Patients in
.J
Cherokee Now.
At the recent inspection of the
ounty farm^lt/was decided, after ob
servation of the very adequateJpi-o
visions for the comfort of the county
charges, that it would be entirely
justifiatoHTtdPreturn a large "per "cent
of the Hamilton county inmates of
the Cherokee hospital for the insane
to, this county.
There are at present thirty-nine
Hamilton county patients at Chero
kee, each patient costing this coun
ty $14 per month, or a total of $54G
per month. At least twenty of the
milder cases will be brought back
and placed on the county farm—
about ten women and ten men. Their
return will necessitate an. attendant
for the women at the farm, one for
the men already having been in
harge for some time.
The expense will be greatly lessen
ed and the accommodations at the
farm will be entirely adequate. The
county farm practically raises all its
own produce and there is sufficient
help to carry on the farm work.
These recommendations have been
made to the Iowa Board of Control
who will arrange the red tape nec
essary to such a precedure and the
patients will be brought here with
in the next two months.
The inspector was loud in his
praises of our new county farm
house and unhesitatingly places it in
the first ranks of' county houses of
the state. Wright county ofllcials
were at the farm recently to inspect
the building and to note its improv
ed features in view of the fine new
county farm hause which will be
built by Wright county this season.

two hUndred feet of flooring under

There was a declivity of about one

which gave way have been fixed so
that skating will be perfectly sate
