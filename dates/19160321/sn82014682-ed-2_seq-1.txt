Statement of Facts. .
A few years ago I should have pah
no attention to charges concerning
me that were utterly false but I knon
better now, than to pasa all of then
up without protest, so h eye is a brle
- statement; of facts covering all essen
tials . having ' to do with my, quarrj
land deal with the territory, Includinr
a little other history that goea hanf
In hand:.";..' ;-; -:, . y .:,
I leased tiie land in question, 90.3'
acres (not 40, as suted la special'
from Waiakea Mill Company In Feb
ruary, 1910, for the purpose of open
Ing up a -quarry in a part of It.-it
order to protect myself from the ex
tortlonate rate forced from me by th
Hilo Railroad for hauling from Kapo
ho. In this I -was not entirely success
fuI,'for under ?Mr. Thurston's skilfm
manipulations the railroad picked xn
bones at th rate of 90 ceats per ton
; for hauling from there, while at th
same time It performed for others
substantially similar service for (
cents and later offered to do the iden
tical same work , for others for 4C
cents.' , The land is both pahoehoe
and a -a, the latter being coered in
places by rather dense vegetation
About 35 acres of this tract lies mau
ka of the railroad tra,ck.
Opened Up Quarry Site.
I spent ,bout $6000 in prospecting
and in opening up a quarry at the
Olaa end of this land, and in conserv
, Ing and keeping It open In good work
ing shape, and this is the principal
reason why the quarry is of any particular-value,
for there is much other
land near by that would make good
quarries, some even better than this,
if the expenditure necessary to open
them up were made. At the least cal
cu !ation there Is 60,000 acres more of
