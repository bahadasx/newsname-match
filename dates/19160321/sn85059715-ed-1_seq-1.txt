"Dress Up" in n sense, is merely auother

through all agCR has. led men and
women to struggle upward, to seek
unwaveringly to follow the beacon

says one objector. "People are spending
too much now. We ought to bo

<11 UtLKSTON". March 2 1. A review
of events of the last week cmphasi7.es
the optimism of Judge Ira;
E. Robinson's friends and Indicates
lhat every county In the ?tati> with
possibly two or throe exceptions, will
give hint a majority over A. A. Lilly.
Ills-opponent for the Republican gubernatorlnl
nomination. In most of
Lbe counties, especially iu the larger
ones, such as Kanawha. Ohio, Cabell
?nd McDowell, the Grafton Jurist will
poll a tremendous vote, while in
many others Ills majorities will be
v I most unanimous.
Even such counties as Wyoming
&nd Fayette, which Lilly early in the
campaign claimed would give hint
ineir sonu support, now are ir aonoi
and Judge Robinson's friends elalin
lie will carry (hem.
Fayette county Is alniosi sure In
swing Into line lor him, they say. and
the last ten days is to be astounding.
One reason for the Lilly defection, It
is said. Is the popular resentment
there against some of the methods
lie tried to use In his campaign. He
is said to have attempted to switch
the voting districts around to suit ,
himself without consulting I bo local
people and they would not stand for
tils tactics. In addition to thut. the
rotors have begun to compare the
records of the two cundldatos and the
balance was so preponderantly in falor
or Judge Robinson that there
r-ould be only one conclusion. While
It Is true Lilly has some personal following
in the county, tne rank and
tile of the Republicans there are more
interested in the welfare of the parly
than in the personal political aspirations
of any one man.
They realize thul Lillys campaign
luetics of attacking the Republican
administration and the Republican
legislature would innke htm. a vulnerable
candidate to go before the,
people Id flio general election. They
foresee thai If nominated, he would
inve to stand on the same platform
with his Democratic opponent nnd de-,
end .himself against the tire not only j
jf lhat party. I?ii( or the charges lie

t would be impossible for him to de- ,
end It from the same attacks roin-.{
ng later from 11 Democratic source.' (
This would make him impossible as, ,
i champion of Republicanism.
On the other hand. It Is pointed'
nit. Judge Kobinaou has always'1
itood squarely on the principles of J
tepubllcanium and steadfastly by the ,
republican party. He ha? nerer been ! 1

arranging Tor the appointment of the
committees to have charge .of the affair.
