EXTRA JURORS ARE
GALLED 10 COURT
On account of so many of the
trial jurors having sat on one or
the other of the two cases to come
before the Circuit Court tomorrow,
it has become necessary to dis
charge a large number of them
and to draw entirely new men in
their places. The following new
jurors will therefore appear tomor
row morning: Herman Busche,
Antone Fernandez (2), R. L.
Huhes, W. G. Pillar, W. C.
Reichardt, E. A. Knudsen, Jos.
Gomez, Charlie Aki, A. Gandall,
J. P. Kahlbaum. J. M. Lydgate,
E. H. W. B.roadbent, Fred. Egger
king, T. B. Buch, Karl Roendahl,
J. K. Kaauwai, P. A. Rbmane,
Andrew K. Leoiki, Gustav Hack
barth and C. D. Milliken.
The jurors not excused, and
who will also appear tomorrow,
nre: M. V. Fernandez, Chas.
Hlackstad, Dick Roder, A. G.
Hime and J. P. Alohikea.
It is a notable fact that there
are three preachers in the new list
above, as follows: Rev. J. M,
Lydgate, Rev. C. D. Milliken snd
Rev. J. K. Kaauwai. Surely this
is a good start for judicial virtue,
and all that is fair and right and
proper will be expected from the
jury.
The cases to come up are two
against Halalu, statutory charges
from Eleele; and a Chinaman
charged with perjury. It is sup
posed that court will adjourn after
these cases are over as they com
plete the term calendar.
OU BEACH PARTY
The Ou Club's March entertain
ment took the form of a moon
light beach party, given at the
home of Albert Horner, Ir., last
Saturday evening. The swimming
was declared to be very fine by
those who "went in", while some
elected to seek amusement at bridge
and other games.
Refreshments were served after
which all wound up a very pleasant
evening in dancing.
To Mother's Bedside
Miss Colburn, of the Kapaa
school, received a wireless on
Thursday announcing the serious
illness of her mother, Mrs. Tohn
F. Colburn, at Honolulu, and re
questing that .she return home
without delay. She left in the
steamer Saturday night Mrs
Colburn was about to undergo an
operation. If all has turned out
well Miss Colburn will return to
her school tomorrow.
Gen. Johnson Coming
Information has been received
that Brigadier-General Samuel I
Johnson will shortly visit Kauai
He will probably be accompanied
by Major L. V. Redington, his
chief of staff. While there will be
no formal inspections or anything
of that sort, there will undoubted
ly be turnouts of some kind whil
the officers are here.
Eleele Politics
Republicans of the Wahiawa
nrecinct foregathered at Eleele
hall Friday evening to nominate
delegate to the convention i
Honolulu. W. D. McUryfle was
nominated delegate, with J. P

much as there was, or is. no op
noaitiou that will be the way th
matter will stand.
I, MM TAKEN
SERIOUSLY ILL
F. E. McCall, a teacher in the
Kauai High and Grammar School,
is very ill in the Lihue hospital
with typhoid fever.
The case came o n suddenly
about last Thursday and developed
rapidlv, so that a very high tem
perature was reached in an un
usually short period, giving the
friends of Mr. McCall much an
xiety. Indications thus far are of a
serious case, although it is a little
earlv to tell with definiteness.
Mr. McCall came to the local
high school at the beginning of
the year in September last. Prior
to that he had been teaching in
the Lahainaluna School, on Maui.
Although a resident of Kauai for
a short time only, he has become
conspicuously identified with
sports and social activities, and is
a lieutenant in the National Guard.
Waimea Literary
Owing to the failure of the set
peaker to arrive, the principal
feature on the program of the
Waimea Literary Society for Sat
urday night did not materialize.
The members were treated, how
ever, to a splendid address bv
Captain G. T. Greie on the sub-
ect of "Patriotism," his remarks
being followed by quite interest
ng discussion.
Prof. John S. Donaghho, of the
College of Hawaii, will be present
at the next meeting of the society
and will give a talk on the subject
of 'Tides." That meeting will be
held at the residence of Supervi
sor T. Brandt.
Fernandez Show
W. Fernandez has been making
a big success of the Blanche Sweet
films in the various theaters of the
island One closed last night at
Kealia and another will now be
put on. A splendid Mary Pick-
ford film is also coming. Announce
ment concerning coming program
appears elsewhere in this issue.

bank, will be a passenger for
Honolulu tonight to attend the
wedding of his brother, who is
deputy city and county attorney

0LIT1CAL POT
SIMMERS
The political pot began to sim
mer in Lihue Friday night when.
:i the district courtroom of the
ounty building, Chaitman II. D.
Wishard rapped for order and
opened the meeting of the Re
publican precinct club. A G.
Kaulukou officiated as secretary
The court room was fairlv well
filled with voters of the precinct.
Hon. C. A. Rice was the princi
pal speaker of the evening. He
lealt chiefly with the business in
hand that of the delegates to be
sent to the convention in Hono
lulu and that of the delegation to
the national convention in Chica
go. In connection with the latter
proposition a letter from Congress
man McKinlev was read in which
that gentleman indicated theopin-
on that Hawaii's delegation to
Chicago should not be instructed.
That seemed also to be the senti
ment of the meeting.
The following were rominated
to be delegates to the convention
at Honolulu, and as they have no
opponents are already elected:
Chas. A. Rice, Chas. H. Wilcox
and J. H. Coney.
Gorman To Koloa
P. A. Gorman, of the grocery
department of Theo. H. Davies &
Company, arrived at Koloa Wed
nesday morning where, it is
understood, he will remain as
managur of Kauai the Trading
Company. Mr. Gorman is well
known on thisisland, having visile
Kauai recularly for about ten
years. He is quite popular and
will without doubt make a success
of the business at Koloa.
TO QUESTION US
According to the following,
published at Honolulu yesterday,
the Liovernor will shortly arrive
on Kauai for the purpose of hold
ing a mass meeting and finding
out the wishes of the people res
pecting the Kapaa homesteads:
Governor Pinkham within
short time will make a trip to Kau
ai for a personal investigation of
the Kapaa homestead situation.
He will call a public meeting of
the homesteaders there to discuss
the cane contracts and the pros
pects for future railroad facilities
tie will prohaUly take the new
laud commissioner, B. G. Riven-
burgh, and may take Superinten
dent of Public Works Forbes.
Announcement to this effect was
made by the governor this morn
..
nig. As published last week in
the Star-Bulletin, homesteaders are
coniplaiuingof delay in Retting their
contracts, many of them negotiat
ing unofficial contracts with Makee
Sugar Company in the absence o
a settlement of the terms with the
Lihue Plantation, the governor
not having approved these latter
"It has been a case of conflict
ing interests, of individuals who
were not themselves sure what
they wanted, and of the territory's
trying to protect the uublic niter
est," said the governor this morn
ing. "When this meeting is call
ed I shall ask the homesteaders
what they want."
The Kovernor says that the ter
ritorv isn't going to be forced into
hasty action by the views of indi
viduals which may not coincide
with public policy. He hopes that
a personal visit with the new land
commissioner will result in a clear
ing of the atmosphere.
