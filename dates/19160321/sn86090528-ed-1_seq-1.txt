BURGLARS
AESTHETIC
IN TASTES
Call at Home of L. D. Major and Annex
$16 in Cash, Gold Watch and Chain,
Also One Large, Luscious
Cherry Pie
According to the story given out a
police headquarters Chickasha Is in
habited by people with aesthetic ap
petites, even to the wandering ele
tucnt who drift in between trains,
pause only long enough to replenish
their depleted wardrobes and treasur
ies and then drift out again
In evidencing the truth of the above
assertion the police stated that after
turglarious visitors had entered the
home of L. D. Major, a night or so ago,
end appropriated $16 in good and law
ful money, they cast about them un
til they found a time piece which
would pass muster in any circle of po
lite society. None of your tin time
pieces would answer. Had an lnger?jl
or a Waterbury have been lying about
they would both have been safe. The
tastes of the intruders called for a
finer article, and when they espied
a solid gold tirno teller, with a gold
chain attached they forwith annexed
both articles.
The trousers in the pockets of
which the $lfi had reposed, were
carefully folded, after the treasury hEd
been depleted, and laid with painstak
ing exactness across the back of a
thair In a room other than the or.e
in which their owner had deposited
them when disrobing on the proceed
ing evening. Nothing had been left
in a scattered condition; every article
which had been moved from one spot
to another had been sH down with
the care of the truly aesthetic person.
After having acquired Mr. Major's
cash, together with the watch and
chain, the intruders wended their
way to the pantry and appropriated a
large and lucious cherry pie This,
together with a glass of cream was re
moved to the front gallery and de
voured. With great evidence of fore
thought and scrupulous care not to
linger the unintentional host of the
eariy morning hours, the "profession
oV left the empty pie plate and the
wtll-drain?d milk glass sitting upon
the floor's breezy edge while they
wandered forth in search of other
fields to conquer.
Mr. Major awakened at an early
hour and missed his trousers from
their wonted resting place. Ho notified
the police.

TITLE TO
LOT WON
BY RIDDLE
Litigation Lasting Nearly Twenty Years
is Finally Terminated in U. S. Supreme
Court; Ownership of Brick
Building Decided
Presenting one cf the most conspic.
uoua examples of the "law's delays'
in the legal annals of Oklahoma, came1
the final wind-up in the supreme
court at Washington yesterday of lit
igation started nearly 20 years ago to
determine the lawful owner of lot 2
in block 40, in Chickasha. Judge F.
E. Riddle being the winner over F, B.
and H. B. Johnson.
On the lot in question now stands
the two-story brick business building
which is occupied by Y. W, Darnell.
By the terms of the court's decision
the defendants in the case are given
the rer.ts on the property up to the
time of the adjudication of the care in
order to reimburse them for the im
provements. The history of this famous piece of
litigation e'ates back to the time the
Chickasha townsite was laid off, the
lots being purchased from the Chicka
saw and Choc'taw tribes of Indians.
Theodore Filzpatrick, now deceased
bought the lot which was destined to
such an eventful career in thecourtf
and later Theodoro Barnhart built a
house on it Subsequently the latter
sold his house to J. P. Ellis, who, like
Barnhart, paid rent to Fitzpatrick
Ellis and Fitzpatrick soon became in
volved in a dispute over the title to
the property, the case starting in a lo-
ca? court. Later Ellis sold his im
provements on the lot to Riddle and
the Johnsons acquired the claim of
Fitzpatrick. From this time on, the
case wended its way through the
mazes of the department of interior,
late and federal courts till the final
award came this week.
Stewart and Cruce and W. A. Led
better, Oklahoma City, have 'been
Judge Riddle's counsellors. Ex-Sena
tor Bailey ot Texas argued the case
with him early this year in the Unit
ed States supreme court.
