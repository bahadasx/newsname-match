INTERESTING MISSIONARY SER-..
VICE \T LITTLE MOUNTAIN
La^t Sunday evening the reporter
had the pleasure of a trip by auto to
biitU* Mountain with the editor and
tne CUlU't'SS ana iujujcu an auit nnosionary
address by Prof. S. J. Derrick
1 who came back to Newberry with the
news-paper bunch.
Prof. Derrick is a forceful and convincing
speaker and his address to the
ccrr,relation o Holy Trinity Lutheran
: church at Little Mountain Sunday
niuiit was in keeping with his reputation
as a speaker and devoted churchman.
- - - * - ? --- - -1 - ?
i nc occasion v as iir: oosc ol cuc
week of 5-rayor by the women's homii
oiid frr-cicrn missionary society of Holy
Trinity church.
After a scripture lesson by the pastor.
Rev. J. .1. Long, and a song service,
Prof. Derrick was introduced in
a few highly complimentary remarks
by the pastor.
Pro.. Derrick expressed gratitude at
the privilege or speaKing to mis congregation
as it was at this altar lie
took the vows of the church and comfenccd
with God. The speaker defined
the meaning of the word missionary
as applied to religion and said
that it was a mistaken idea that the
religion of Jesus Christ was one
1- - -1- J J _ 1 ,1
wuicn piuuuucu a idee uuu a
whining. conipjlaining disposition.
On the contrary, it was a religion
of jof and optimism wliich
teaches how to live here and hereafter.
After comparing conditions in
Christian America with those in Pagan
India, he urged the spreading of the
gospel and insisted that if we believed
the srosoel we would spread it. He
discussed the question as to whether
the heathen would be saved if they
failed to hear the gospel and asserted
that so far as our knowledge goes
they could not he saved.
He refuted the idea that the great
European struggle was evidence of the
failure of (Christianity and attributed
this great world war to the influence
>of the devil. He was insistent in his
prase fo r the unselfish and devoted
work of the women in the foreign mission
field but. he declared with great
emphasis that this is a man's job.
The speaker closed with an appeal
to his old church to take on renewed
interest in the subject o* foreign missions.
At the close of Prof. Derrick's address
Miss Gentry sang a solo while
the ladies of the society took up a collection.
u ne collection was a very liDeral one
and was evidence of the interest of
the congregation in the mission cause.
