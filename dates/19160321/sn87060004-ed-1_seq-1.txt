OUR PUBLIC FORUM
Peter Radford
ON ADVERTISE IT IN AMERICA. , ; "
As a citizen' ot this nation and ono Intensely Inter
ested in Its material development, I want to add my ap
proval to tho "Buy It In America" movement. Commer
cial patriotism . And business pride are tho foundation
stones of success: n Industry and no country can becomo
supremo In conlmerco and trado unless It fosters a spirit
of friendship and partiality for Its own products and insti
tutions. It is 'the spirit ot tho hlvo that makes the
wheels of industry turn and each community should bo
a progrosslvo unit In our Industrial universe. All things
being equal tho '.farmer should patronize tho local mer
chant, who Is always a good citizen, a heavy taxpayer
and .friend ot tho farmer. Tho farmer sends shiploads
of raw material to foreign markets and factories that
meet on their way vessels laden with finished and foreign
grown products coming to America. Any effort to minimize this economic
waste ought to bo encouraged.
But as a farmer and friend ot the manufacturer and merchant I want to
BUggest an "Advertise It In America" movement. The manufacturer and
Jobber may blow loud blasts on the horn ot patriotism but If they will put
an "ad" In tho nowspapers In their trado territory, making a business presen
tation ot their goods, they will find it far more effective than waving the
Star-Spangled Banner. Tho farmer Is as much lntercstnd In tho price ot the
things ho has to buy as In tho prlco ot tho things he has for sale and tho
advertising columns ot his newspaper are his price list The- prlco Is tho thing
and tho farmer wants the figures ln'cold type. The politicians give him all
tho patriotic buncombo ho cares 'for. Business enterprise Is a far more-successful
salesman than business patriotism.
Thero aro many most worthy organizations working to promote commerce
and trade but wo seldom find organized effort to promote tho press, yet it Is
recognized as tho most powerful agency for progress the world has ever pro
duced. Wo havo all sorts of days calculated to promote, business and honor
Industry such as Trades Days, Bargain Days, Labor Days, etc.; why not
have a press day and all business concerns advertise the things they have
to Bell and everybody subscrlbo for tho local paper and all delinquents pay a
year In advance? Thero Is nothing so elevating in civilization as the smile
ot an editor and nothing will contribute more toward tho welfare of a com
munity than tho prosperity ot tho press. '
Tho farmer Is a friend and patron ot the newspapers. Ho subscribes for
the local paper and reads every line in it and It is tho best investment be
can make. Thero is no news so valuable as storo news; no Information so
Interesting as market demands; no tragedy so entertaining as the rise and
fall of prices and no pago more closely studied by tho farmers than the adver
tising columns of tho press. ,
