EL PASO, Texas, March 21.—
ited States cavalry under Colonel
orge E. Dodd early today were re
rted on forced marches from Cruses
ward Namiquipa to reinforce Car
za troops under Colonel Cano, en
ged in a fierce running fight with
lla's bandits.
Encircled by Carranza and Amerj
forces. Villa was making a deo
rate effort to reach the Santa Clara
nyon in the Guerrero mountains,
enty miles east of Namiquipa. The
sence of news from the battlefield
ce Juarez officials late yesterday
ceived the first word of Villa
ought at bay, led t6 fears that ho
cut his way through the armed
and was temporarily safe.
To trap Villa if he escapes the cen
„1 column from Cruses," Brigadier
-neral Pershing has sent cavalry
uadrons southward to the Babricor-i
nch and to Carmen on either sl'le
Namiquipa.
One of these three columns shonll
within striking distance of Villa's
ar guard within twenty-four or
irty-slx hours.
Several aeroplanes with' the expe
ition spent last night on Mexican
il near Ascencion. They were
'ithln a few hours flight of the
amiquipa battle field and may pos
ibly be of assistance to the Ameri
reinforcements in locating the
andit's followers.
While opposing forces were on
very side of Villa today, he might
ave eluded the Carraazistas at Nami
ulua during the night arid reached
"e rugged Santa Clara district.
The aeroplanes would be of great
alue in scouting miles ahead of the
uraulng forces.
General Gaviera, Carranza com
andant at Juarez, early today said
had received no further details
an that the defacto troops and Villa
ere yesterday evidently engaged in
desperate conflict and that Ameri
reinforcements were rushing to
assistance of the Carranza attack
5 forces. Gavira sent urgent re
uests for additional information and
plies were momentarily expected in
uarez.
Gavira pointed to the battle at
amiquipa in denial of reports that
arranza troops are disposed to let

The Carranza consul Intimated that
U. S. expedition has established

ed out that the thousands of Ameri
can troops at Fort Bliss and Colum
bus were sufficient protection against
the implied ihreat. There has been
no sign of friction between the de
facto government generals in Juarez
and the expeditionary forces.
It was reported, but confirmation
from Quererato was lacking, that in
return for President Wilson's aid to
Carranza, permission was to be given
the war department to send troops
and provisions by railroad to the ex
pedition's Mexican base.
The number of soldiers of all
branches who have crossed the bor
der and taken up the chase after
Villa, was today believed to be up
wards of 7,000.
At 8:30 a. m. today, Gavira said he
had not been advised of the result
of the battle at Namiquipa. Suspense
was noticeable in local military and
civil circles. The belief was glowing
that the engagement would not prove
decisive.
The dispatcher of the Mexican
Northwestern railroad near .which the
lighting was reported to be taking
place, said no word had been received
since last night. It was not known
whether the wires were cut or the
Carranza forces were withholding in
formation.
Gavira was asked if Villa had been
killed or captured and to both an
swered "no."
Carranza Consul Garcia of El Paso,
visited Gavira's Juarez headquarters
to learn the outcome of the battle.
Garcia said communication with
Namiquipa was "cut off. He did not
know where the-trouble was, but said
it was effectually preventing the ar
rival of news from the battlefield.
In Hot Water.
SAN ANTONIO, Texas, March 21
"The next few hours may tell the
story."
This was General Funston's ourt
comment today on dispatches relat
ing to Villa's clash at Crucez with
Carranza troops coming north from
Chihuahua, the bandit's defeat and
subsequent flight north directly to
ward three south bound American cav
alry columns. With these detach
ments of U. S. soldiers headed for
Lake Babicora, El Valle and Carmen,
any effort on Villa's part to escape to
the north seems effectually spiked.
A hard night ride brought the
American soldiers close to their quar
ry today. While army headquarters
has no definite word the com
mander of the Carranza column is for
mally co-operating with the American
general, Pershing, through his own
scouts, evidently is being kept ad
vised of the former's movements.
"On the map, it looks like Villa
might be In hot water," remarked Gen-

"Von Tirpitz has died a thousand
deaths since the war began. He has
bade farewell to hundreds of splendid
young submarine officers who went
out to perish miserably under the
water. The code among German sub
mariners requires that they shoot
themselves when the situation of their
II boat becomes hopeless. Von Tirpitz
has pictured to himself—for such is
the nature of his mentality—too many
terrible under water scenes involving
his friends. Et is known beyond a
doubt that Von Tirpitz felt himself liv

kaiser himself was unalble to calm his
self reproach.
"German military men say the Lusl

Anxious to Get Near Him.
DOUGLAS, Ariz., Mancfa 21.—"God
pity poor Villa if the Seventh and
Tenth ever get within sight of him,"
heartily exclaimed an officer at Camp
Douglas today.
When Douglas was in danger and
Villist® bullets rained in the city dur
ing the bandit's attack on Agtia Prieta,
the two American cavalry regiments
"stood by" Douglas and the warmest
feeling prevails here for the squadron.
Members of the Tenth, colored, fre
quently expressed a desire to go after
"dat Villa nun." The Tenth Is now
reported to be in the vanguard of
General Pershing's column. A num
ber of troopers In both regiments have
•fallen victims to Villa snipers in the
lighting around Agua Prieta. The
squadron is expected by officers here
to give a good account of itself when
It catches up with Villa's band.
Disturbing reports of the concentra
tion of large Carranza farces within
striking distance of the border here
abouts are believed .to be exaggera
tions. Officials of the defacto govern
ment make the most emphatic decla
rations of co-operation.
Mormons Gave Welcome.
WASHINGTON, March 21.—A hint
of the vociferous welcome with which
American troops were greeted by the
Mormon colonists near Casas Grandes
as they galloped Into the town with
colors flying, was given in a brief dis
patch to the war department today
from General Funston. The message
also carried the first official intima
tion of how far American troops had
penetrated the Mexican waste and
tended to oontradlct reports from BJ1
Paso and other border towns to the
effect that there is disaffection among
Carranza soldiers and tnat natives are
on the verge of an uprising against
the United States soldiers.
The message reads in part: "We
have found the natives friendly every
where. The Carranza forces also are
showing every indication of friend
liness. The Mormons greeted our
troops as rescuers."
Secretary Baker, who read the
above portion of the dispatch, ex
plained he could not give out the full
text because some of it related to
military movements which might De
affected by publicity. He admitted
"It is entirely likely additional cav
alry has entered Mexico at Columbus
since the first column under Colonel
Dodd started out after Villa."

world engaged in peaceful pursuits,
President Walter Rundman of the
board of trade, declared in an ex
clusive interview given the United
Press today, officially outlining for
the first time the allies' commercial
plans after the war.
England does not contemplate a
throttling that will leave the German
people crushed in poverty, unable to
rise again, he said.
"But peaceful preparations as a
means to a military end will never
again be tolerated by England, France,
Russia and Italy," Runclman asserted.
j'iNor can we submit to 'most favored
nations' clauses in commercial treaties
'being utilized to the detriment of any
one of the allied countries. We ob

and commercial relations with us for
purposes of aggression as she did In

Runciman's statement Is of the
highest Importance, In view of the
forthcoming aDied commerce confer

American traders and manufacturers,

competition in neutral markets after

''If this is the deliberate object, we
and our allies will know how to meet
an aggressvie war of that nature Just
as we have met hostile action for the
last twenty months. But we will be
I better prepared for this threatened
economic war. We are much obliged
to Germany for warning us before

"The economic war which she
threatens will be a permanent barrier
to the peaceful development of hmrope.
I have myself used language hostile
in character in regard to Germany's
trade. I did so, believing that crush
ing the enemy's trade was an essen
tial step to victory in this war."
"Germany's power of resistance, as
well as ours, depends upon the extent
of her material resources. These we
must, as an act of war, diminish in
value. We must do everything in our
power to prevent her from accumulat

abroad. We are doing everything In
our power to prevent this. We can't
allow our citizens to trade with Ger

are withholding supplies. That is only
one of the many instances. We want
to make it clear to Germany that the
longer the war continues, the less
will be her chance of recoupment out
of the profits of foreign markets. We
aim at shortening the war."

A few hours earlier came admis
sion from the Austrian war office of
an important Rusian victory In south
eastern Galicia, thirty-eight miles
northeast of Czernowitz.
This victory renders precarious the
position of remaining Austrian forces
on the north bank of the Dniester,
and forecasts the beginnings of a
new Russian campaign against Buko
wlna. In view of the rumored en
trance of Rou mania into the war,
this development is regarded as high
ly significant.
The German war office admitted
that the Russians are making heavy
attacks on a wide front in the Riga
Dvinsk sector, despite heavy losses.
It Is considered certain here that the
power of the new Russian offensive
will force the withdrawal of German
troops from the western front and
possibly end the Verdun offensive.
On the Verdun front, the Germans
last night renewed their attempt to
squeeze the French out of the strong
ly fortified positions west of the
Meuse. The attack was partly suc
cessful, the French war office admit
ted, though the Germans suffered
heavy losses.
