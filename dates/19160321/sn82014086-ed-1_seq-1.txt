Heavy battles have been In progress
northwest and northeast of Verdun and
on the northern part of the Russian
front, where the Russians are keeping
up their strong offensive against the
Germans. In all these zones the losses
have been large, while the clianges in
position have been relatively unimpor
tant. Northwest of Verdun, in the sector
of Avoncourt-Malancourt, the Ger
mans, after a terrific battle, drove a
vicious infantry attack in which liquid
fire was employed against the French
front. A fresh German division brought
up from a remote point participated in
the operation. The French, however,
with their curtain of fire, aided by
machine guns and infantry, put down
the attack with heavy casualties to
the assaulting forces, except in the
eastern part of the Malancourt wood,
some ten miles from Verdun, where the
Germans made slight progress.
Berlin reports the repulse, also with
heavy losses, of the French who at
tacked the village of Vaux, northeast

fortress there have been only intermit

of fights in the air between French

Jennings Bryan here tonight opened
the campaign in Nebraska, speaking
in favor of a state prohibition amend

Lincoln, brother of the former secret

democratic nomination for governor
A dispute between Mr. Bryan and
John G. Maher, a local politician, in
which the lie was passed to Mr.
Bryan in a hotel lobby, enlivened the
informal meetings previous to to
night's gathering.
The dispute arose over a question
of Mr. Maher as to whether one of
the speakers from the east, who was
on tonight's programme, was getting
paid for his services. Mr. Bryan re
marked that Mr. Mailer's motive was
mercenary. This provoked the retort
that Mr. Maher followed It with other
.charges.

BE REACHED TODAY
SUBSTITUTES DEFEATED
Bill
Fixes Strength of Regular Army
at 145,000 Man, Expandable to 175,000
by Executive Order if War is Im
minent.
Washington, March 20. By refusing
definitely to increase the regular army
provisions of toe Hay bill, the house
today made It almost certain that the
measure will go to the senate virtually
as framed, and .by an overwhelming
voie. Chairman Hav of the miiitarv

uiiai vuie couia oe reacnea tomorrow.
President Approves Outline.
The net result of the day's debate
on proposed amendments was to sus
tain the recommendation of the presi
dent as to the ize of the regular army.
The Hay bill carries cirtually the pro
gramme mapped out by former Secre
tary Garrison in this regard, but sub
stitutes the federalization of the na
tional guard for the continental army.
The president has approved its gen
eral outline, but stands uncommitted
as to details.
Defeated Proposals to Increase.
Three times during the day the
house defeated proposals to increase
the peace strength of the regulars,
fixed by the Hay bill at 140,000. ex
pandable to 15,000 by executive order
If war is imminent. The debate cen
tered upon the Kahn amendment to fix
the authorized peace strength at
220,000. but the first vote was on a
substitute offered by Representative
Fuller, republican, of Illinois, to make
1 I'SU.OUO.
'The Fuller substitute was lost with
out a division. The Kahn amendment
was voted down. 183 to 103. after ap-
i peals for a larger standing arm v had
been made by Representative Mann,
republican leader, and other influen
tial members of the minority.
Only two democrats supported the
Kahn amendment in debate and less
than a dozen voted for it. About 40
republicans voted against it.
Representative Crago, republican, of
the military committee, proposed to
fix the strength at 200.000, but was
voted down by a substantial majority.
One-third of Measure Approved. .
With this outstanding feature dis
posed of, consideration of the remain
der of the bill went forward rapidly.
About one-third of the measure had
been reviewed and approved when ad
journment for the day came. The na
tional guard, industrial reserve and
nitrate plant sections are among those
still to be considered.
Final Measure Must Be in Conference.
The final measure must be written
In conference, as the senate and house
proposals differ radically. ' Should the
senate committee work out a combina
tion of its own measure with the house
bill, however. It appears likely that the
national guard, industrial reserve and
nitrate plant proposals of the Hay bill
wm De retained, while the senate's
ngures or 178.000 peace strength for
the regular army will be Inserted with

concerned with their operation, how

have a fu'l and an anxious sense of
responsibility.".

eryone to stop work. There ia a ma
chinists' union at the factory, but the
great majority of workers are not be
lieved to be organized. Many of the
employes are foreigners.

strikers entered the city hall, barricad
ed the doors, and refused to allow
anyone to be present. . The meeting
was a short one and those present de
clined to discuss what happened.
