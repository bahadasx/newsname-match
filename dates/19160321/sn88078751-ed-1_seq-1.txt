VILLA TRAPPED?
El Paso, Tex., March 20. Francisco
"Villa has been driven into a trap by
the rapid advance o the American
troops, according to the information
received hero In -wireless dispatches
from the front and In telegraphic dis
patches to General Gabriel Gavira, the
Carranza commander at Juarez. The
bandit chief is said to bo hemmed in
on all sides. Ho is reported near the
Babrlcura lake region, on the ranch
of Mrs. Phoebe Hearst.
El Paso. Tex., March 20. General
John ,1. Pershing, commanding the
American expedition into Mexico, has
-divldo.i liis farces in. tho hopnnf catoh-
tng Villa between them, according to
the latest Information reaching here
from .Mexico. Pershing left Casas

vras,sent';.outheast through Chocolate
pass, and Is following the trail which
the Carranzlstas declare Villa took
in his retreat south.
General Pershing's reported plan is
tc march his own force south parallel
with the Mexico Northwestern rail
road, hoping to meet or overtake the
bandit loader, who has passed through
the Continental divide over the Babi
corn trail from Las Cruces. Colonel
Dodd is expected to keep on the trail
of the bandit and his men either ,
through the Continental divide or I
outh from Las Cruces through Naml-1
qui pa toward Guerrero.
The beat information obtainable is
that Villa Is in tho vicinity of Babi-
cora ranch, having passed through the
mountains forming the Continental di
vide without molestation by tho Car-
ranza troops. In his haste Villa is
reported to have abandoned Pablo Lo
rfcz, one of his lieutenants, wounded
in the raid on Columbus, N. M., at El
Valle. when he passed through that
place. Lopez was the man who com
manded the Mexican force that mas
eccred eighteen Americans at Santa
Ysahol In January. A few days later
the Carrnnzistas exhibited tho corpse
of a man in Juarez which they claim
ed was that of Lopez, but which Amer
icans who knew Lopez declared was
the corpse of another man.
Villa's Plans.
There Is much speculation as to the
plans of Villa. Tho Carranzlstas pro
fess to beliovo that he will break up
his forco into small bands and scatter
through the mountains, but thero la
belief in some quarters that he
either heading south In an effort to
form a junction with Zapata or will
turn west In an effort to reach the
Mexican Pacific coast and get as fur
as possible from tho American bor
der. It Is understood that tho Amer
ican forces aro convinced that the I
Carranzlstas aro mailing very llttlo I
effort to capture Villa, many of tho
Carranza troops bolng former Vlllls
tas, still In sympathy with Villa, and
many of tho others being afraid to
meet htm In battle.
Tho news from tho Pershing column
stated that somo of the horses and
mules of tho American expedition

Villa Would Incite Uprising Against
American Expedition,
Washington, March 20. Strong
doubt exists here as to the loyalty of
tho Carranza garrison at Torreon.
Press reports say that outbreaks have
occurred in the city between Vlilistas
? rid Carranzlstus, and last week Unit
ed Statc3 Consul A. L. Williams left
hurriedly for the border with forty
American refugees. .Mexicans In
Washington who formerly represent
ed Villa here predicted that Villa's
purpose undoubtedly is to take Tor
leon, garrison himsolt there and then
depend on his agents throughout
northern Mexico to stir up a storm of
ictftgnatlon against the entry of Amer
ican troops on MexlckC soil.
