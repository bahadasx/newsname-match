I'm one of the doubters. I think it's
a toss-up as to whether England can
exhaust Germany.
Should the I'nited States so into
the war on the side of the Allies, aid
ing them not with soldiers but with
all our economic resources, then I am
sure Germany would lose.
I think that to prepare now Is sheer
idiocy. Let us wait till the end of this
war to find out whether we need "pre
paredness" or not.
England would be glad to throw
over Japan to get aji alliance with us.
Ily Prof. W. J. Shepard.
A state governor told me that pacif
ism was tile virus creeping Into us
and chloroforming us Into forgetting
the emergency.
Ily ('. Lowes Dickinson.
I look forward to a world state
some day.
We (the English) have been bullying
the Irish for about three centuries,
worse than Germany ever treated any
body. We have created a masterpiece
of how not to govern Ireland.
Yes (in reply to the ideas the Ger
man professors were spreading), pro
fessors do get ideas.
Ily SHii.il War Correspondent.
Furious lighting was resumed by
the International Polity Club along
the frontier of the V. M. C. A. Build
ing last night. The battle lasted an
hour and a half. The troops first ap-
lK-arPil in the V. M. C. A. Auditorium;
then, picking up their chairs, they
shifted the scene of operations to
Room ('. Finally they came back to
the auditorium. Among the generals
were G. Ixiwes Dickinson, fellow of
Cambridge 1'niversity. England: II. J.
Davenport, dean of the School of Com
merce; M. P. Meyer, professor of experi
mental psychology; Max S. Handman,
Instructor in sociology; Manley 0.
Hudson, professor of law; W. J. Shep
ard, professor of political science, and
the Rev. P. J. Hate or the Calvary
Episcopal Church.
Mr. Dickinson began the discussion
by announcing that he was ready to
answer any questions in regard to his
speech In the University Auditorium
or his articles in the Atlantic Month
ly. He referred to his plan of a com
pulsory "cooling oft" period before
recourse to war. Such a plan
would. In Mr. Dickinson's opinion,
probably avert war in that it would
allow time for discussion and point
out the aggressor. He showed the
value of economic pressure as a force
to stop war.
A point of Interest, in view of the
fact that so many teachers were pres
ent, was that nearly all seemed agreed
that poor education was largely re
sponsible for war. The evil of im-
planting strong nationalistic hatred in
i. school children was commented upon.

Mr. Dickinson, "centers around your

EL I'ASO, Tex., March 21. "1 think
it is only a question of time until Villa
will bo taken dead or alive," said Gen
eral Gavira, the Carranza commandant
at Juarez, this afternoon. He admit
ted that he had heard nothing of the
battle between the forces of President
Carranza and the Villa band at Naml
quipa. It is thought here that Villa has es
caped both the enveloping movement of
the American soldiers and that of the
Mexican government. Xo direct word
has been received from General Per
shing for several days.
There is intense feeling against the
Mexicans here. It is understood that
Villa has a force of 1,500 men and is
recruiting more as he retreats into
the interior of Mexico. ,
Despite the advices from the Car
ranza troops as to ttieir movements,
suspicion has been aroused along the
border because of the presence of a
large number of Carranzistas bet we-n

MEN, WHY STAY SINGLE?
TWO CAN LIVE ON $500
A class of sixty girls in home
economics recently estimated tfca
.minimum amount a couple should
have saved to begin housekeeping and
the Income the man should have in
order that they may live comfortably.
One girl finds that a couple can
really live comfortably on $.'00 a year.
Another finds that $2,000 will be nec
essary. Still another gives a medium
income of $900. A hundred dollars a
mouth is the average salary named by
members of the class.
Most of the girls figure that a man
should have saved from $2."0 to $300,
and some believe that he should also
have a house and lot. Those who sug
gest that the bride should contribute
her savings toward the furnishings of
the new home name amounts from
$100 to $9,"0. Her "savings" generally
includu gifts from "showers," from
her parents, wedding .presents and the
contents of her "hope chest." Per
haps also she may have saved several
Hundred dollars of her income as a
teacher or in some other position.
That the problems might be of real
ly practical value to the girls, they
were asked to estimate the cost of
living for a couple in circumstances
similar to their own. Many of the
members of the class consulted their
young married friends, finding the cost
of the furniture and the cost of liv
ing, as well as the division of the in
come. One girl who believes that a couple
with ideals and tastes similar to her
own can live comfortably oir an in
come of $900 a year gives the instance
of a recently married friend.
"The husband," she explains, "has
a position as teacher In a small town,
with a salary of $100 a mouth during

and doing a little sewing, having some
time left for community work and

Because of a daily schedule, she is

duties in four or five hours daily. Her
time is divided in this way: breakfast

preparation for lunch, 3r minutes;
washing dishes from lunch, 20

ed somewhat twict a week by cake
baking, making salad dressing and
other food preparation and weekly
house cleaning. But these things
generally comprise the routine of
household duties.
In working out the problems, the
members of the class took into con
sideration the size of the town, esti
mating a higher cost of living in the
city than in the small town. Where

Ity United Press
ST. JOSEPH. .March 21 When tem
porary Chairman Dumm opened the
Missouri State Democratic Convention
tills morning with a defense o Gov
ernor .Major's administration he was
howled down by 1,200 delegates.
Dumm was interrupted frequently
during his "keynote" speech. Some
one yelled "Have a heart." The dem
onstration became so loud that he was
forced to quit in confusion.
The howling down of Dumm Indicat
ed the fight against the -Major-Rum-sey
faction would take up most of
the time.
The Pendergast faction from Kansas
City broke into a wild demonstration
when the convention adjourned until
later in the afternoon. Adjournment
was taken to give various commit
tees opportunity to meet.
It was learned later that Pender
gast will support -Major, if Senator

Finiinoiig College Course by Summer
Work Discussed at Forum.
Financing a college course was the
topic discussed at the Y. M. C. A.
Forum last night. Summer work for
the University man who wants to accu
mulate as much money as possible
during the summer vacation was dis
cussed by Prof. J. E. Wrench of the
history department and by students
who have had ezperienceas agents, as
harvest hands and in other work.
Professor Wrench said that, speak
ing from the standpoint of a teacher,
he thought it best that self-supporting
students should make their school
money, as far as possible, during the
summer months.
Many turn to salesmanship as the
best possible means to make the most
or their vacations, but only a Tew men
have the girt to succeed along this
line, Proressor Wrench said. He
liointed out tilings that college men
might do during the summer. Work in
harvest fields insures good wages and
good food and the kind of work many
college men need. Hundreds or col
lege men do hotel work at summer
resorts and make from $100 to $200 a
summer.
