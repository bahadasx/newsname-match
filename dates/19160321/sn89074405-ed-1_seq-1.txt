Washington, March 21.—Presi

K1 Paso, Tex., March 21.—School

town 30 miles east of El Paso, and
all American citizens have been re

military authorities, according to a
telephone message received here by
H. D. Camp, a Fabens school trus

Fabens is opposite the Mexican vil

Cs^ife'itsa forcer yesterday at Naml
qulpa. Detail^ of the fighting. In
which Colonel' Cano. with about 900
Carranzaistas took part, Is still laok
ing, but reports have it that Villa
-was badly worsted, and that he fled,
leaving his dead and wounded behind.
Captain B. D. Foulois, in charge of
seven birdmen, has been selected for
the task of scouting for Villa, who,
following his fight with Cano, Is ex
pected to scatter his bandits rather
than risk an engagement with the
American troops who are said to bar
his way to the north.
Difficult Chance.
Army officers agree that If Villa
breaks up his command Into small
bands and turns to the Sierra Madre
as a hiding place, it will be well nigh
impossible to capture him. Villa
spent his early days as an outlaw in
these mountains and passes through
which an army and its transports may
not move. It takes 10 or 12 days to
negotiate these tortuous passes into
the Sonora district.
Villa probably will not go into the
Sonora country, where he is hated and
feared because of his raids, but the
Mexicans here believe he will hide
himself away in the mountains until
the American troops have given .up
the chase.
San Antonio. Texas., March 21.—

MOUNTAIN AND DESERT REGION
San Antonio, Tex., March 21.—The
steady and rapid advance of a part of
General Pershing's force into Mexico
has Increased the desire of those at
army headquarters here to be per
mitted the Northwestern railway for
moving supplies. Las Crucas, a point
that probably will be reached by one
of the cavalry detachments is about
200 miles from the border and lake
Babricora, a like distance. It was
pointed out that any delay in getting
supplies through from the border to
Casas Grandes, from where it can be
sent forward to the mobile units op
erating south of there, might inter
fere seriously with General Pershing's
plan of pursuit.
Funston Hopeful.
General Funston evinced no Im
patience, but he did show concern and
expressed the hope that Carransa
would not misunderstand the motive
for his request.
Even if the request is granted, it
will be some days before the road can
be used, because at twp points at
least, repairs will have to be made.

Captain Ar­

aviators and other officers here to
mark a new era in the upbuilding of
the aeronautical branch of the ser
vice. Captain Cowan, it Is believed,
will not be detached from aviation
duty, as no orders have been received
from the war department relative to
sending him back to his regiment.
Important plans for the develop
ment of aeronautias have been re
ceived here, according to Captain
Cowan. The first step in this direc
tion, i( was intimated was the placing
in command of the aviation training
school an officer off comparatively
high rank.
According to Information received
from Washington today in private dis
patches, congress will appropriate
*1.000,000 for army aviation purposes
for the fiscal year 1916-17.

of Colonel Glassford, is in command

SOMETHING AS FINE AS A ROSE.
Bechtel's double flowering is the
finest of all the crabs, and at a dis
tance seems to be covered with roses,
says E. P. Powell in Farm and Home.
It blossoms when not more than four
or five feet high, and keeps at it liber
ally until it is 15 or more feet high.
All crabapple trees are beautiful and
can be recommended on a small lawn
for shade and for florescence.

American rolling stock will have to
be sent across the line on account of
its lack on the other side, the Ameri
can crews and dispatchers will be
used.
"The reason for their use should be
obvious," said an army officer last
night. General Funston has made it
plain to the war department that his
only desire to use the road is for the
transportation of supplies, but he has
not concealed the fact that a guard
will be placed on every train and that
it might become necessary to station
guards at different potnts along the
rest of the way.
Beef Needed.
General Pershing has advised Gen
eral Funston that he has found quan
tities of alfalfa for his animals alBo
that he has experienced difficulty in
getting fresh beer.
The question of occupying cities and
townB in Mexico Is not worrying those
at headquarters.
"Our troops will be too busy to
'camp in any one place long on ac
count of sanitary conditions," said one
of the officials.

IB
Washington
action of the ai
bill was to adopt without debate an
amendment to give the president ab
solute control over the reserve of 60,
000 men. The bill originally provided
that authority, must be granted by
congress before' the reservists could
be mobilized. The amendment, of
fered by Representative Kahn of the
committee, and- accepted by Chairman
Hay, puts the reservists under the
orders of the secretary of war to be
sent to any point when the call to
colors goes out. The amendment is
one of the most important additions
to the bill yet made.
As the measure now stands, the
president would have authority with*
out consulting congress, to Increase
the army from 140,000 fighting troops
to 176,000, and also to summon to tne
colors 60,000 roaorvists, which the bill
contemplates will be provided within
four years.
Reject Proposal.
The house rejected the proposal by
Representative Anthony, republican,
of Kansas, to recruit an additional in
fantry regiment in Porto Rloo for
service in the Panama canal zone or
elsewhere. Encouraged by the nar
row margin which defeated the Kahn
amendment, Representative Gardner
re-offered the first proposition of that
amendment in new language. It car
ried 128 to 117, being the first defeat
for Chairman Hay during the consid
eration of the bill.

GERMAN OIANQIIOR NOW HAS

Berlin, March 21.—Friends of Im
perial Chancellor, Dr. von Bethmann
Hollweg, are now quite confident that
he has so well in hand, the political
situation with the displacement of
Admiral von Tirpitz, as Minister of
Marine, and that there need be no
fear that It will develop into what is
termed a "chancellor's crisis."
'They bellevo the National, Liberal
and Conservative resolutions, calling
for the unlimited use of submarines
against all vessels of the belligerents,
with exception of passenger ships,

discussion or vote in the Reichstag.
Discussion Delayed.
Prime movers in the agitation, Herr
von Heydebrand, conservative leader
in the Reichstag and Major Ernest
Basserman. the national liberal leader
have avoided the introduction of in
terpellations to which the chancellor
would be forced to reply and have
chosen to clothe their proposals in the
form of resolutions, which unless

Carranza Men Will Cut Off
Villa's Escape in Sonora
Region.
Douglas, Arts., March II,—Four
thousand^ troops of tha command of
General B(. Hi'-lMegues, 'itt t!ha-rge of
the Yaqal campaign In western Sono
ra, It has been announced here, were
ordered today by General Callea to
proceed from Hermosillo to Sahoaripa
in southeastern Sonora. The men will
travel In troop trains to Tonlche,
southeast of the capital, and then
march overland Into the Sabuaripa
valley.
These men are being sent to guard
Dolores pass, the southernmost of the
four passes leading through the moun
tains along the Chihuahua-Sonora
state line. Reports that Francisco
Villa and his bandits were making
their way south from Casas Grandes,
Chihuahua, before the United States
troops led to this disposition of the
Sonora troops.
The arrival of the detachment at
Sahuaripa will increase the Carranza
troops on duty in eastern Sonora to
a total of approximately 6,000 sol
diers. The column was expected to
reach its destination Wednesday or
Thursday. General Enrique Estrada is
in command.
General Calles said today that he
was awaiting word from officials in
New York of the La Oolorada Mining
company as to whether they would
comply with his request to reopen
their gold mines near Hermosillo.
That there is absolutely no danger
to Americans who were employed In
these mines and that he would guar
antee full liberty to all residents with
in the state, and especially in the
Hermosillo district, was the declara
tion of the military governor.
Unless the company officials decided
to resume operations of the La Colo
rada mines within a "reasonable"
time, state officers will take charge of
the plants and reopen the minea,
General Calles added.
TOWN SHAKEN BY

Findlay. O., March 21.—Town* in
this vicinity last night were shaken

NO AOTON TAKEN.
London, March 21.—There is no in

Will Not Speak.
In any case the chancellor will
scarcely speak upon the subject mat
ter of the resolutions unless he is
compelled to do so. The movement
which found expression in the resolu
tions is composed of two constituent
elements.
First, there is a large body of popu
lar opinion, which is honestly interest
ed in the submarine weapon and de
sires it to have every opportunity to
display Its efficiency unhampered by
political restrictions. This element is
generally unaware of the political mo
tives which play a part in the move,
ment.
Political Group.
Second, there are those who now,
and long, have desired having another
chancellor: one who would permit dis
cussions of peace terms, and the
projects of annexationists, who are
for the sharpening of tha submarine
campaign regardless of political dan
gers.

SEEMS LIKELY
Mexican Consul Thinks the
Railways May be Used
For Supplies.
B1 Paso, Tex., March 11.—Andjco
Garcia, Carranza consul here, and
know-to .be In intimate-relations with
the flrst' fchlef, maintains that
is ho danger of friction ever the ques
tion of the shipment of American
army supplies over the Mexican rail
ways. So long as it was merely a ques
tion of supplies, Mr. Garcia said to
day, it was a matter of small conse
quence. He added, however, that the
passage of American soldiers on Mexi
can trains would come under a differ
ent category.
"The Americans have permission to
buy supplies in Mexican towns," said
Garcia, "so I see little difference, so
far as the attitude of the Mexican
government is concerned between al
lowing merchants to ship food to sell
to the American troops and the Amer
ican army shipping direct.
"I cannot see," he added, "how the
United States needs to rush down any
more troops, seeing that our com
bined forces amount to about 50,000
men, opposed by only two or three
thousand. We have too many troops
already for the purpose, it seems to
me."
Whatever be the outcome of the
situation, the military and civil au
thorities here are taking no chances
of being caught unprepared. Both
General Bell and Mayor Tom Lea
take every necessary precaution while
asserting with all the emphasis in
their power that they can see no rea
son for alarm. General Bell is re
ported to have conferred with a local
mining man. J. Y. Baskin. an author
ity on Mexican trails, regarding the
passages into Mexico from the coun
try east of El Paso. These trails were
developed before the days of railroad
ing and are of great military import
ance.
Five soldiers from Pershing's ex
pedition have arrived here by train
the past two days from Columbus to
be treated for Illness or accidental
injuries at the front. One of the
men, a negro trooper, has temporarily
lost his eyesight from the glare of
the sun, and irritation caused by the
alkali dust kicked up in the march.
He is now said to be recovering. An
other man belonging to the Twentieth
infantry suffered from an injurv to a
leg. The Thirteenth cavalry and the
Fifth field artillery, he said, were from
fifteen to twenty miles in advance of
the infantry on the march, but com
munication was maintained between
the units at all times. The men were
taken to the Fort Bliss hospital.
ODANAH PEOPLE

Ashland. Wis.. March 21.—With

Snow in the woods is from four to
