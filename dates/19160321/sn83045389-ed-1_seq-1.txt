Buy-right Hints for
the fhrifty Housewife
reoplc to-day enjoy more
luxuries than ever before in the
history of the world. We mean
by this, the masses. There was
a time when luxuries were an
exclusive privilege of the very
wealthy. This discrimination
is no longer a monopoly of the
affluent.
This change in conditions
has been brought about largely
through advertising. Advertis
ing provided the outlet for vol
ume. Volume expedited the
cheapened manufacturing me
thods, while at the same time
elevating and maintaining
quality. Competition in all
lines has run riot in reaching
the public with the best goods
These Are the Days of
Inexpensive Luxuries
at the lowest prices. Equable
and convenient tenn^ of pay
ment lias been another factor
in putting people in possession
of luxuries they were formerly
denied. People buy property,
pianos, phonographs and fur
nish their homes complete, and
acquire many other things
nowadays, with the option of
protracted credits, never even
dreamed of a quarter of a cen
tury ago.
The advertising pages of The
Times-Dispatch carry the mes
sages of the merchants who sell
the luxuries of life, as well as
those who sell the necessities.
Whatever you may need, or de
cide to indulge in, you'll find
advertised in these columns.

IN OK \ IK) IT .11 Mll/y:
The Associated Press learned on un
questionable authority that tlio troops
of the tic facto government which hail
been seen at Casus ilrandes h:ne been
withdrawn and arc now in or about
Juarez. I'rom the same source it was
learned that at least one detachment
of Carrnn/n troops had refused to fight
Villa, and had withdrawn 011 the
bandit's approach, leaving him free to
pass into his favorite mountain fast
ness. This detachment withdrew on
receipt of a message that he was war
ring, not on Mexicans. hut the enemies
of Mexicans.
The extraordinary rapidity with
which the American cavalry pushed
into Mexico gave rise to high hopes
yesterday that the unexpected had
happened and the notorious bandit was
cornered. This seemed inevitable it
the Carranza soldiers did their part
and if the account of the strength of
their field forces was. correct. Villa,
cut off front the north by the forward
sweep of the American columns, from
ih<> west hy the Sierra Madre barring
the approaches to tin* State of Sonora,
was supposed to he equally barred from
the east and south by powerful Car
ranza forces.
It now seems certain that Villa h.is
been moving freely in at least a largo
section of the country supposed to he
held by the troops of the first chief.
In the last few days !)?? has beon va
riously reported by iJeneral Ciavlra. '.he
Carratiza commander at .Juarez, at
points along a line reaching north awl
south from (Sah.-aua to X'anilquipa. a.
distance of ahout seventy-five miles.
Hy the same accounts he has not been
moving steadily south. but roving
north and east The mountainous,

The reason for the Carrauza troops
moving to the border remains unex
plained. p. i.s impossible even to huiko
it fair estimate of the number of men
under iJeneral Clavira at Juarez Tiu?
large stall' at his headquarters and thd
fait that new troops are arriving daily
indicate that his force is a large one.
The most conservative estimate places
it at 3,000, and calculations range from
that point upward to S.OOO. Kvcrv pre
caution has been taken to prevent tl'.e.
facts being known, ami most of th>>
men are kept outside the town among'
the hills. Reports from Aguapriet.i
?nd Ojinaga tell of Mexican ro-enforce
incuts reaching those points also, bu;
nothing is known as to then num

There is no question that there 1h
se.rious and growing uneasiness in K1
I'nso. which has been sharply accentu~

over the request of the United States
