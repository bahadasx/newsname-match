Senator Oliver, however, said ho was

If the factory was established.
Senator Oliver gave tho Ho direct to,

said.
Vote Starts at 4 o'CIock.
The Senate will begin voting on tho

Cody and Red Chief
Converse By Signs
Blackfeet Head's Vocal Greeting
Sounds Like Steam Exhaust
Frpm Dinky.
William F. Cody (Buffalo Bill) and
Mountain Chief, head of the Blackfeet
tribe, made "sign talk" In the office of
MaJ. Gen. Hugh U Scott, chief of staff
of the army, today.
Colonel Cody called to pay his respects
to General Scott, whom ho had aided in
Indian campaigns. Thb -Indian chief has
been a frequent visitor at General
bcott's office because the general Is
perhaps the only man In Washington
who can converse with him In sign
lanruagc.
Colonel Cody made a few cabalistic
motions with his hands as ho approached
the Indian.
"Blackfoot, howdy," he said.
Tho Indian grunted, touched the top
of his head, and shot his hand Into the
air. accompanying tho motion with a
vocal discharge that sounded like the
exnausi or steam rrom a. dinky engine.
To Colonel Cody It tniant;
"You haven't as much hair on the ton
of your head as you had when I last
saw you."
Then Colonel Cody and Mountain Chief
stalked deer, chased the buffalo over
tho plains again and recalled some old
Indlnn fights, all In sign language.
Colonel Cody was accompanied by
"Johnnie" Baker, the crack shot of the
old Buffalo, Bill show.

MEAGRE NEWS FROM BATTLEFIELD
American Force Establishes Base Near
Casas Grandes Three Columns Sent
To Attempt To Block Retreat
From Namiquipa To the Hills
EL PASO, March 21. American cavalry squadrons
are hastening by forced marches southward to trap ViHa
before he can reach the Santa Clara mountains.
The bandit chief is still engaged with Carranzists
near Namiquipa, according to all advices reaching here
today.
General Gavira, Carranza commandant at Juarez,
has received but brief information, but indicates that the.
Villistas have been cut off from .further retreat southward
and are being crowded northward in the path of the ad
vancing American squadrons.
Col. George Dodd's cavalry is reported today to bd
hurrying from .Crusts toward Namiquipa to re-enforce
.jCarranza troops uhdeY;Coionel CanQihgagdi4n a fierce
running fight with the. outlaws.
FOJXOWED HAlfcD RIDE.
Following its record-breaking ride from Hachita,
Dodd's cavalry is reported making another forced march
to aid the Carranzistas in cutting off the flight of the
Villistas.
Encircled by Carranza and American forces, Villa
is making a desperate effort to reach the Santa Clara can
yon, in the Guerrero mountains, twenty miles east of
Namiquipa.
General Gavira, Carranza commandant at Juarez,
early today said that he had received no further details
than that the Carranza troops and Villa yesterday evening
were engaged in a desperate conflict and that American
le-enforcements were rushing to the assistance of the Car-
ranza attacking forces.
Gavira sent urgent requests for additional informa
tion and replies are momentarily expected in Juarez.
GAVIRA DENIESREPORTS.
Gavira pointed to the battle of Namiquipa in denial of
reports that Carranza troops are disposed to let Villa get
away, and give him an equal chance with the American
army on his trail.
At 8:30 a. m. today General Gavira said he had not
been advised of the result of the battle at Namiquipa.
The dispatcher of the Mexican Northwestern railroad,
near which the fighting is reported to be taking place, said
no word had been received since last night, it is not known
whether the wires were cut or the Carranza forces were,
withholding information.
General Gavira was asked if Villa had been killed
or captured and to both answered "no."
Carranza Consul Garcia, of El Paso, Visited Gavira'$
Juarez headquarters to learn the outcome of the battle be-
tween Villistas and Carranzistas.
COMMUNICATION WITH FRONT CUT. '
Garcia said communication with Namiquipa was cu$
off. He did not know where the trouble was, but said it!
was effectually preventing the arrival of news from the
battlefield.
The absence of news from the battlefield since Juarez
officials late yesterday received the first word of Villa
brought at bay, leads to fears that he has cut his way
through-the armed ring and is temporarily safe.
To trap Villa, if he escaped the central column from
Q uses, Brigadier General Pershing has sent cavalry squadi
rons southward to the Babricora ranch and to Carmon, on
cither side of Namiquipa.
One of these three columns should be within striking
distance of Villa's rear guard within twenty-four or thirty
six hours,
m Several aeroplanes with the expedition spent last
night on Mexican soil near Ascencion. They were within
u few hours' (light of the Namiquipa battlefield and may
