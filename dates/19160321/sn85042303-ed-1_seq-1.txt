If the report of Villa's de

American army officers believ
ed that the expeditionary
l.rces have an excellent chance
if encountering Villa on the
rail or in the country to the

Although he had no news of

FILES SUIT WITH CORPORATION
COMMISSION AGAINST LOCAL
COMPANY, ALLEGING THEY ARE
NOT FURNISHING GAS.
Mayor Mullen has tiled a complaint
with the stad' corporation commission
against the Ardmoro City Lias Com
pany, alleging that the company was
not furnishing sufficient gas to the
consumers of this city. This case will
probably be up for hearing within a
short time.
The gas question has been a bone
of contention between the company
and the consumers ever since It was
installed. All sorts of allegations have
been circulated, and in the face of all
these the gas company has stated re
peatedly within the past few weeks
that they were doing their best to
remedy the situation.
It is alleged that there are millions
of feet of gas available in the lleald-
i ton field and that the company should
be compelled to lay mains of sufficient
size to transport it to the cily. Gas
for manufacturing purposes if only
available during the summer months,
and the city officials think that they
should be supplied with enough to at
tract manufacturers here as they are
in other places where cheap fuel is
available. The officials of the gas com
pany here announced a few days ago
that they were going to lay a larger
line in order to remedy the very thing
prayed for by the mayor in his pe
tition. Man Burns to Death.

Prices in Mexico.
The following extract from a letter
received by an Ardmore citizen from
a brother who is in Mexico, gives a
slight idea of what the Americans
have to contend with there. Follow
ing is part of the letter:
"The money here is worth today
less than three cents U. S. money
for one Mexican dollar, while prices
for everything are away out of sight.
A pair of shoes costs over $200, while
a 25-pound sack of flour is only $33.

what we are up against In a financial
way, and explains where our salarie.s I

AT IACTB
LAST HIT
ANOTHER AFFRAY ADDED TO THE
ALREADY LONG LIST OF LIKE
CHARACTER THAT HAS TAKEN
PLACE IN OIL FIELD TOWN.
As a result of a recent atve.-t of
two people at Kagtown for vagrancy,
J. II. Wilson and A. M, McCoy of that
place are now at the Hardy sanitarium
bndly wounded, as tin' result of a
shouting affray, and Hill Price is in
the county jail to await investigation.

morning that Wilson and a woman
were arrested last week on a charge
of vagrancy, they were arraigned he
fore a local Justice of the peace here
and the woman entered a plea of gull
ty, while the man pleaded not guilty
and made bond.
He relurned to Itaglown and ac
cused Price of "turning him in" to the
officers and in the gun fight that fol
lowed, Wilson was badly wounded
and A. M. McCoy, an innocent bystand
er, also received a bullet from an auto
matic pistol.
The wounds of both men are said
to be dangerous, according to the coun
ty attorney, who will await develop
ments before holding the preliminary
hearing. The county attorney stated
that the report that all parties In this
affray had been drinking, is untrue,
they were all sober, and circumstances
related above, led up to the shooting.

ly railed, has been the bane of the
local officers' existence for some time,
