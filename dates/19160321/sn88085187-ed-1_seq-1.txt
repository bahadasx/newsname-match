Answers
CLARK—"I woulii not."
CLAYTON' —"Under no circum
stances."
DOW—"No."
KLKKTWOOD—"No."
ORONEN—"Generally speaking, I
would not."
JAMIESON—"I would favor having
them all timed so that all the fran

at the same time."
MAdILL-'i would insist » * •
all expire concurently."
M'OREGOR—"HusIneRS Judgment

the franchise* on the whole line ex

I'ETTIT—"No."
STOEVER—Declines to commit
himself.
VAUGHN—"NO."
WOODS —"Should expire at the
tame time. In fact, if it were possi
ble, 1 would be glad to see the fran
chises covering all linen iv, the city
expire at the same time."
Second Question
Wlutt compensation, in your opin
ion, should the T. IS & P. Co. make
the city in rase these expiring fran
chise* are renewed?
Answers
CLARK —"The same per cent of gross
earnings as now paid by said company for
similar franchises, and in addition would
insist, before granting a new franchise,
that the company make such betterments
ami improvements to the system as the
needs of the public demand, without im
posing undue hardship upon the company."
CLAYTON—"The T. R. & P. would have
to change many of Its ways and start in at
least to he. just and fair to the public be
fore I would agree to any extension of
franchises, and pay well for the privilege
of such extension and for the privilege of
running advertising signs in its cars."
DOW—"The time of expiration is so far
ahead, that the complications and diffi
culties that may arise cannot be foreseen.
It Is hard to say just what the compensa
tions should be, but certainly not less than
we are now receiving."
KBKRT —"1 am not prepared to an
swer the compensation question, as that
would be governed by circumstances; I
mean the service and earnings of the
company."

ing at present."
(iIU)NEN —"Either ft cash percentage of
their gross NTHMI, us they are now pay
ing, or extension of trackage or service, or
both."
JAMIKBO.V—"There is no doubt in my
mind that the T. H. & I', is losing money.
We do not want to do anything that will
force thin company or any other company
into bankruptcy. Let us nurse them along
until all their franchises expire, and pos
sibly by that time the city of Tacoma will
be in a position to do as the city of Toronto
did some years ago—refuse to renew any
franchises and pay the compHiiy what its
rolling stock, equipment and other personal
propert are worth."
MAOHiIi "1 would demand that the
cars, tracks and streets adjacent to tlie
tracks lie kept in first-class condition, that
they would pave between the tracks and
that the company pay a fair percentage of
their gross eurnings.' 1
M'OKKGOR — "The T. R. & P. Co should
be required to keep that part of the streets
injuriously affected by car traffic in good
condition at all time?. The payment of at
least 2 per cent gross revenue tax to the
city."
PETTIT —"As to compensation. the
charter requires 1 per cent of grosß re
ceipts on franchise grants. The T. R- &
P. Co. now pays 2 per cent on passenger
and 0 per cent on freight, I believe. The
company ought to expect and the city cer
tainly should receive full value for fran
chise renewals. Just what the compensa
tion should be probably should depend on
conditions at the time. If the city can get
backing of the state laws I should like to
see it in a position to require reduced fares
to at least six tickets for a quarter, with
tickets sold by conductors. 1 feel a city
of 100,000 should be entitled to this, and
under present conditions it might even
yield the company nrore revenue than the
present plan. The whole question under
existing situations in one of more or less
bargaining, and in that event the import
ant thing is that city officials shall abso
lutely represent the city in the deal."
STOVER —Declines to commit himself.
VAUGHN —"Should require that all
present franchises bo lived up to and all
blanches of the present lines givo efficient
service to the public, and should favor ex
tending some branches to balance the city's
rights with some privileges already
granted."
WOODS—"I believe in making the best
possible terms for the city. Conditions
change and it la impossible for me or any
one else to say at this time what per cent
the company should pay on a franchise
granted in the future. It should, however,
in my judgment, be based on the gross
income."
