Shipping Of Supplies From
El Paso to Be Considered
In Separate Note.
WASHINGTON', D. G. March 21
President Wilson and his cab
inet today decided to accept a
proposal fer a protocol between the
United States and the de facto govern
ment of Mexico for cooperation in the
pursuit of Pancho Villa and his out
laws
A tentative draft of the proposed pro- i
tocol between the defacto government
of Mexico and the United Statos, under !
which American and Carranza troops I
would cooperate in running down Fran-
cisco Villa, the bandit, was being pre- j
pared todav bv Klisen Arrednnrtn Mr.
ican ambassador designate. Mr. Ar
redondo and acting secretary of state
Polk already had reached an agreement
on the general principles involved.
It is said the protocol will set forth
the rights of the American troops, the
nature of. the cooperation expected
from the Carranzn. spldicrsn.nd will
troops, although the speclflqlrequest to
ship supplies f row Kl Paso Will be dis
posed of separately.
Carranzn Troopa Cooperate.
Troops of the de facto government
actually are cooperating with the
American forces, and, according to in
formation received by the war depart
ment are planning to render even
greater assistance High military of
ficials allowed it to become known that
the Carranza. government had promised
to moe a large force or Its troops from
central Mexico to the north, forming
a trap into which tho American cav
alrymen under Gen. Pershing may
chase Villa and his followers.
I. W. IV. Makes Trouble At Xosnles.
During the day disturbing reports
came to the war department from Gen.
Funston regarding conditions at Na
gales, Sonora. There, an official dis
patch said, members or the Industrial
Workers or the World were engaged
in making Incendiary anarchistic
speeches to stir the Mexican popula
tion to rash acts. The speakers, ac
cording to the dispatch, are believed
to have crossed the border from the
United States. The Information was
turned over to the state department
wnich will advise tne de facto govern
ment of the conditions in Nogales.
Mlla T.nst 00 nt Colnmbns.
. Gen. Pershing. In a delayed dispatch
which reached the war department late
In the day, reported that in the raid
on Columbus. N. M., Villa lost 200 men.
This count Includes killed and wound
ed, and men who deserted during the
fllaht from Columbus.
The proposal for the protocol, which
It is planned to have remain in force
until Villa is captured, came from Mr.
Arredondo and was a direct result or
the request of the United States for
permission to use the railway between
El Paso and Casas Grandes for the
shipment of supplies to the American
expeditionary forces. Mr. Arredondo
Is understood to have received instruc
tion from Gen. Carranza to discuss the
request with the state department and
to propose the agreement by which a
complete understanding will be had
by both governments.
"No lleslre to Embnrrnsn Cnrrnnzn,
The United States, it Is understood.
Is prepared to make every concession
under the circumstances to the de facto
government, it being a fact that as
American troops are operating on
Mexican soil the de facto government
Is entitled to the greatest possible con
sideration. It Is the desire of offi
cials that nothing be done which In
the slightest way would tend to em
barrass the de facto government, or
bring about any adverse feeling of any
kind.
Word that the Carranza troops were
reaching portions where they may
head off Villa It he attempts in his
flight before the American cavalry
men, to strike still farther south, was
receded hero enthusiastically.
Hear of Clashes Willi Vllln.
Press dispatches containing the an
nouncement or Gen. Funston that Gen.
Villa was reported to have been de
feated by Carranza troops at Las
Cruceg and to have turned back north
ward toward El Valle. rrom which
point the second American column In
moving, were regarded" as being ex
tremely favorable, as were reports of
an engagement between Villa forces
and Carranza forces near Knmiquipa.
Both reports were read with much In
terest in ofricial circles. If they prove
to be correct officials say, the Amer
ican troopers may be expected to es
tablish a contact with the band of
outlaws at any time.

A special train bearing a fresh sup

Tuesday no information cam
through to the border to tell whethe
or not the D0 Carrancistas whipped

tunes of war were the reveree.
The battle was reported as takinc
place near Namiqulpa, Chihuahua. on
of the purported southern objectives
of the bandit leader. It was stat' d
to have begun at 4-30 oclock and th
heralding of the event was wired It

of the correspondents in Kl P-iso, an.l
later of all America, through the news

It was explained at the consulate
Tuesday morning that shortly after the
message was received regarding the
battle, the wires south of Guzman had
been cut. "Perhaps It was at t'asas

thing happened to the wires and we
are quite, as much in the dark as to
the outcome as the least informed per

took is approximately 70 miles from
