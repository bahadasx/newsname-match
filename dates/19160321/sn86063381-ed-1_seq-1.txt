SCENE OF BIO BAD)
Tells of Raid to Pioneer Represen
tative General Villa a Hero,
Say Papers.
"There is absolutely no respect
for the American flag among the
Mexicans."
This remark was made this morn
ing by Miss Lucile Bailey who ar
rived in the city with her brother,
Harrison, from Deming, N. M., to
visit with their grandmother, Mrs.
H. W. Bailey. O. E. Bailey, son of
Mrs. H. W. Bailey, will arrive in
Bemidji in a few days for an in
definite visit. Deming is 30 miles
from Columbus where the recent raid
was made by Villa. The Bailey fam
ily was at Deming when the raid was
made and their home was used by
fugitives from Columbus.
Claims English Blood.
"When an American wants protec
tion from the Mexicans he claims to
be an Englishman," said Miss Bailey
to a Pioneer representative. "The
Mexicans respect the English flag but
have ceased to respect the American
flag through the many insults being
left unpunished.
"The feeling of the Mexican is not
strange, however, since the Amer
icans hate the Mexicans. There is
no love lost between the 'greasers'
and the 'gringoes.' Expect Big Attack.
"That the Mexicans intend to,
through deceiving the United States
troops in stating that Carranza fa
vors the pursuit, draw our men to,
Mexican soil and then join forces is
generally conceded near the border."
In regard to the Columbus raid,
Miss Bailey said:
"Word fljrst reached Deming on
Thursday morning when A. D. Frost
accompanied by his wife and baby
drove in from Columbus by automo
bile. Mr. Frost stated that upon
hearing a number of shots at about
three o'clock in the morning, he ex
pected trouble and found that the
Mexicans had commenced a raid. He
roused his wife and child, and with
out dressing took the automobile and
hurried toward Deming. A shower
of shots from Mexicans was sent after
them and Mr. Frost sustained a bullet
wound in the shoulder.
"Mr. Frost's story angered the cit
izens of Deming, and armed bodies
of men started in pursuit of Villa.
The parties ended the chase nine
miles out of Columbus."
In State of Horror.
The whole territory along the bor
der is in a state of horror on account
of the atrocities committed by the
Mexicans, according to Miss Bailey.
She stated that in the Columbus
raid "greasers" ran through the
streets killing everyone on the streets
and setting fire to buildings. As the
citizens attempted to escape from the
flames, General Villa's men shot them
down and threw the bodies back on
the flames.
"There was one queer result of the
raid," said Miss Bailey. "The day
following the raid every Mexican
paper played up Villa as the hero.
One Stated that Villa had captured
Arizona and New Mexico and that
President Wilson had fled to Canada.
This made Villa the hero of Mexico
and increased his forces many thou
sands.
Miss Bailey stated that Villa was
considered by far a better general
than Carranza in that he is more
popular and has a superior control
of his forces. The reports in Mexi
can papers tend to increase his popu
larity.

ANOTHER MEETING TO
BE HELD NEXT WEEK
Taxes, Need of New School, Improve
ments and Debts Are Discussed
at Meeting.
About 100 citizens*and taxpayers
attended the mass meeting which was
held at the Nymore school house last
evening to discuss and consider the
proposed consolidation with Be
midji.
H. C. Blackburn, president of the
village council and a member of the
school board, presided at the meet
ing. He stated that the meeting had
been called to obtain the sentiment
of the people and taxpayers on the
consolidation with iBemidji. He
showed that the financial condition
of School District No. 4, of which
Nymore is a part, is very poor, that
the tax rate is very light, being 13.8
mills. The assessed vato^ttn.ijs ,ax^

He stated that as a result of a joint
meeting of the Nymore and Bemidji
school boards, it was found impos
sible to consolidate the two school
districts without consolidating the
towns.
An Old Matter.
"Consolidation is. getting to be an
old matter with the school board and
the council, yet some of the citizens
of Nymore do not understand it,"

that the Bemidji school would not
consolidate unless the city of Bemidji
and the village of Nymore also con
solidated, the Nymore council took
it up and investigated. We found
that Bemidji is willing to consolidate
and that It sow lies with the taxpay
ers of Nymore, in whose interest this
caeeting was called."
Mr. Smith stated that it would be
much cheaper to consolidate than,
nave the citizens and taxpayers of
Nymore near the tmrden.
Town is Bankrupt.
"The fact of the matter is that the
town is legally bankrupt, and if we
tried to raise bonds adequate to the
amount needed for the construction
of a new school it would simply be
waste of material and energy."

RESIDENTS OF EL PASO
WORRIED OVER RUMORS
Reported That Mexican Troops Are
Being Stationed Along the
Border.
El Paso, Tex., March 21.The
United States cavalry forces under
Colonel Dodd is making forced
marches from Cruzes toward Mami
quipa to reinforce the Carranza troops
who are engaged in a running fight
with Villa. Although encircled, Villa
is making a desperate effort to reach
Santa Clara, canyon in the Guerrero
mountains.
Villa Leads Bandits,
El Paso, Tex., March 21.The
forces of Colonel Cano were engaged
in battle late yesterday with bandits
led by Villa in Namiguipa, according
to a dispatch received by Gen. Ga
ivira, Carranza's commander at Juarez.
Namiquopa is in the district of Guer
rero, state if Chihuahua.
Colonel Cano is in command of a
force of 900 cavalry, which came in
contact two days ago at El Valle
with Villaistas, who on this occasion
fled without giving battle.
Believe Withdrawing.
In spite of the reports that the
Carranza forces have engaged the
Villa men at Namiquipa, there seen
to be a feeling here that the Carran
za forces have failed to hold their
end of the net closing about the ban
dit chief. There were confirmatory
reports received today ot the news
received last week,that the Mexicans
"A' ,-r^ffi
-t,
FORTY CENTS ZEE MOJHM
erate withrthe Amerfcan^troo^^but
in certain instances, at least, they
were actually withdrawing from the
field of operations.
Reported Roving.
In the last few days Villa has been
variously reported by General to
vira, the Carranza commander at
Juarez, at points along a line run
ning north and south from Galeana
to Namiguipa, a distance of about 76
miles. Blithe same account, he has
not been moving steadily south, but
roving north and east. The moun
taineous, canyon-split roadless coun
try in which he is operating adds as
many miles to the country as he has
covered as compared with its distance
on the map.
No Explanation.
The reason for the Carranza troops
moving to the border remains unex
plained. It is impossible even to
make a fair estimate of the number
of men under General Gavira at
Juarez. The large staff at his head
quarters and the fact that new troops
are arriving daily indicates that his
force is a large one. The most con
servative estimate places it at 3,000
and calculations range from that
point up to 8,000. Every precau
tion has been taken to prevent the
fact being known, and most ot the
men are kept outside of the town.
Reports from Agua Prieta and Oiinga
tell of Mexican reinforcements reach
ing those points also, but nothing is
known as to their numbers.
There is no question that there is
serious and growing uneasiness in Bl
Paso.

co Villa may be forced into the nghjt

Mexican sources, are correct.
General Pershing reported today
that Villa had been reported defeated
by Mexican government troops near
Las Cruces and that he was march
ing northward on the retreat.
General Pershing's report was fol

port that Villa was still fighting at
