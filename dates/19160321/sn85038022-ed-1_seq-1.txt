TRINIDADASPHALT
To lie Used In Herons! ruction of East
Second Street From Union
To Carmcl Street.
The City Dads met In adjourned ses
sion Monday night to consider thS
matter ot letting the contract tor the
reconstruction ot East Second street
from; -Union to Carmcl street.
"City Engineer dlailcr mado a re
flpdii recommending the use ot Trlnl-
. rtadasphaU, nnd the Internal Im-
- provement Committco reported the
sarho ns the city engineer, both re
ports, recommending that Council
:- award tho contract to Cary, Heed &
Company of Lexington,
After a long discussion over these
reports no action was taken, savo In
letting tho contract to tho Lexington
firm at their bid.
An ordinance was received regard
ing tho chnngo of the location of the
Tracks of the Street Itallway Company
to tho center oftho street from Union
to Carmcl. The contract provides that
tho company Is to pay all tho cxtrn
cost of paving tho street above tho cost
of a straight street, this meaning that
they will pay for tho extra concrete
under their tracks, for tho noso brick
on the brick street nnd for tho granite
blocks on tho asphalt along tho rails,
and ngrco to pay for moving their
tracks tho center of tho street, tho city
ngrccing to glvo tho company tho some
rights tindor their franchise nnd, If nu
ccptablo to tho contrnctr, to purchase
tho gravol and sand now under their
trncks.
A petition from tho property owners
on Lower Market street, asking for
nsphalt Instead of brick, was read and
referred to tho city attorney. He Is
of tho opinion that this can not bo done
without a chnngo ofthe entire ordl
nance.
From facts that have been Biibmlt
ted, Trinidad asphalt that was select
cd over tho Aztec at a cost ot about
3,000 more, will not bo nny nioro ox
pcnslvo than tho lower-priced mater
lal, ns tho dlfforenco will bo almost
entirely iald by tho Streot Hallway
Company, tho difference of $3,000 In
the two bids being In tho cost ot tho
granito along the car rails, and this
will bo paid for by tho car company
thus placing the two bids at almost
tho same figures tp tho property hold
era.
Council adjourned to meet again
next Monday night.

London, March 21. lhfrjrliodjr Is
talking of nn curly pence, not only In.
London, but In I'nrls, Ilerlln nnd other
European cities.
.Huch significance Is attached to the
fact that the German press no longer
speaks In Inexorable terms when peace
nroiiosals nre hinted nt in author!
lathe neutral centers.
It Is nlso reported here that English
ship charter firms Iiiito cancelled huge
war orders. A cablegram recehed at
Oalreston, Tex jestcrdny from
prominent concern states that inline
dlntc neuce Is expected In Europe. The
message cancelled arrangements for n
large nojoiint of tonnnge which nns
to haio hccii shipped from there to the
belligerent nations.
Thus far there lias been no comment
on the declaration made In the FrcnchJ
Chamber of Deputies Iqst week by M,
Alexander Itllio t, Minister of Flnnncc,
saying: "We can state without exng.
gcratlon, without Illusion nnd without
inln optimism, that o now see the
end of this horrible uur."
In certain quarters this Is regarded
as a challenge to the central powers,
meaning that they liaie reached the
end of their resources ut Verdun anil
Salonikl, that they would not he able
to get a step further nnd that they
may lose out if the entente ullle
should launch a powerful offeushe.
The greatest council of war since the
mighty coutllct In Europe began will
take place In Furls this week. Six of
the allied nations, England, Kussla
France, llelgium, Italy nnd Serbia, will
he represented.
Though plans of supreme Impor
tance by which the allies hope to de
llrcr a- smashing stroke which will
Itrinfr tho end of the war In sight will
be considered, there nre not a few who
believe that armistice and pence mat
ters may bo considered.
