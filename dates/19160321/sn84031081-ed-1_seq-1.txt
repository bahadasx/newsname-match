Douglas, Ariz., March 20. General
P. Calles, military governor of So
lium, announced late today ut AKuu
I'rieia, opposite here, that he was
jucpurinff to issue, a decree within the
next day or two abolishing all state
concessions Issued by former Villa
governor o Sonora, Jose Maytorena,
and other state officials under Diaz
and Villa regimes. The decree, if is
sued, will affect many of the mining
companies, public utilities and firms
dealing in commodities.
The decree, however, will not re
voke these grants given many of the
large American and other firms op
erating in Sonora by the federal gov
ernment of Mexico. New concessions
will be Issued Immediately It was stat
ed by Ives O. Lelevier, consul here of
the de facto government.
Consul Explains Move.
. jrfnri o rperjantia the. sover'i
ment of Sonora, on a more stable ba
sis, was given by Consul Lelevier
die) reason for the contemplated ac
tion. Many Individuals and corpor
ations, he declared, had obtained val
uable grants through bribes to form
er officials and In return, had obtain
ed concessions which were exempted
from certain taxes and had been al
lowed to opt. ate under other condi
tions more favorable than to natives
and other foreigners.
"The decree abolishing all of these
old Btate concessions will be issued in
order to give a better chance to the
average resident and Investor living
or operating in Sonora," Consul Le
levier stated today. "The present
concessions make many exemptions in
taxes and other regulations that are
not just. New grants will be issued
immediately probably to the present
holders."
Officials of mining companies lo
cated In Sonora, who are at present
iti Douglas, ueeiiuea to comment late
today when informed of the intention
of General Calles. Alany merely said
that they had been complying with
all requirements of the state govern
ment and knew of no reason for with
drawing the concessions.
Judiciary Unorganized.
The judiciary department of fthe
state of Sonora has been reorganized,
according to Consul Lelevier, wito an
nounced that the new state supreme
court was installed yesterday at Iler

General Calles said today that he
was awaiting word from officials in
New York of the La Colotado Min
ing company, as to whether they
would comply with his request to re
open their gold mines near Hermo
sillo. That there Is absolutely no danger
to Americans who were employed in
these Mines, and that he would guar
antee full liberty to all residents with

llermosillo district was the declara
tion of the military governor.
Unless the company officials de
cide to resume operations of the La
Colorado mines within a "reason

charge of the plants and reopen the
mines, General Calles added.
General Calles tonight received a

Eastern Companies Have Prac

IWr MOHNINC JOURNAL RRRCIAk LIARIO WIHSJ
Washington, March "0. Net reve
nues of eastern railroads of the
United States virtually have been dou-
I bled within twelve months, according
to figures made public today by the
Interstate Commerce commission.
Southern railroads increased their
net revenue more than SO per cent
within this period, while the western
roads added ubout 16 per cent. These
comparisons, covering the months of
January, show that eastern roads re
ceived an average net revenue of $(509
per mile operated, compared with
$30 7 per mile a year previous; south
ern roads, $:118 per mile, again-st $205
tin 191.', and western roads, ziu per
mile, against $187.
Experts attribute the wide disparity
in the ratio of increase between east
ern and western roads largely to the
poor showing of railroads in Texas,
Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arizona
and, to some extent, to the virtual ces
sation of commerce with Mexico.
Kailroad experts are now seeking to j
learn why southwestern roads have
failed to respond proportionately to
the general revival of prosperity
throughout the country.
A little more than a year ago south
western roads Were in virtually the
same predicament as the southern,
the southern roads perhaps being in
worse financial condition than the
southwestern. Wages in some depart
ments were reduced, men were laid
off and rigid economies instituted.
Today southern railways are more
prosperous than for some time.

Columbus, X. M., March 1!0 (by
Wireless From General Pershing's
Headquarter in Mexico.) Six bi
planes of the First Hero squadron un
der the command of Cupl. H. D.
Kulols, arrived today to scout in the
mountains for Villa. Two machines
left last night, one this morning. Four

Additional troops arrived here to
take the place of the thousand men
rent from the temporary base to try
and pursue Villa. The above dis
patch was passed by the military cen
sor. No locution of the temporary base
is given in the dispatch passed by the
censor but yesterday's wireless inti
mated that General Pershing had es
tablished headquarters near Casus
Grandes, from which point he was
sending out columns in pursuit of
Villa. Today's dispatch apparently
means that only 1,000 men, probably
picked cavalry, ure actually engaged
in the case of the bandit In the moun
tain retreats in which he has taken
refuge, while the remainder, about
four thousand in all, representing ar
tillery, infantry and cavalry, are held
at the Mexican base.
LAHGE CAVALKV EOKCE
MOVES INTO MEXICO
Columbus. X. M., March 20. A
large body of American cavalry left
here today. The troops, which were
brought here from Texas border
points were preceded by a motor
train carrying supplies. Whether the
detachment will serve as a separate
command in the effort to capture
Francisco Villa or whether it Is to
join the punitive expeditionary force
now in the field under General Per
shing somewhere in northern Chi
huahua, was not Indicated by military
authorities here,
Accompanying the troops were a
number of American civilian scouts,
said to know tho mountain trails of
Chihuahua, in which Villa Is reported
to bo fleeing, as the city man knows
his front yard. Wearing the som
brero of the frontier, heavily roweled
spurs, and with little, wrinkles at. the
corners of their eyes, bespeaking lives
spent in the open, those scouts form
what is said to be the most pictur
esque group of men in the expedition
ary force.
Military men frankly admit that
upon their knowledge of the district
in which Vllhv is reported to be flee
ing, rests much of the hope for the
capture of the bandit. It is these vol
unteers, many of whom Villa drove
from their 'homes and their property
in Mexico, that are leading tho Amer
ican columns to the water holes and
to the hiding places in the mountains
in which the bandit and a few of his
folIowfr might seek to evade tho
American pursuit.
That more Villlstas than the seventy-nine
already accounted for were
killed in the running engagement fol
lowing the raid on Columbus, was in
dicated ln the discovery of three ad
ditional bodies, reported hero today
by II. K. Lemmon, a ranchman. Mr.
Lemmon asserted that one. of the
bodies is clad In the uniform of a
lieutenant and that they were found
lying Just north of the boundary three
miles south of here.

San Antonio, Tex.. March :.'(.
Francisco Villa may be forced Into
the fight with American troops within
the next thirty-six hours, If reports
coming to General Funston, both
from G'-neral Pershing and from
Mexican sources, are correct.
General Pershing reported today
that Villa had been reported defeat
ed by Mexican government troops
near Las Cruces and that he was re
treating northward. General Per
shing's report was followed, however.
by the unofficial report that Villa was
still fighting nt Numiquipn, south of
Las Cruces.
Hot 1 oat Is Difficult.
If the Carrnnjs-i forces win in the
fighting that was said to be contin
uing late today, Villa will have to
move northward along a road over
which a detachment of American
troops is lidijiit southward, or leave
the road and head for the Santa Ma
ria mountains that parallel the road
to the east, or to the Oriental range
on the west side. Retreat, according
to the report, is imprucl icable be
cause of the presence In his rear of
Mexican troops who forced him to
turn northward from Las Cruces.
Americans Across Pathway.
The detachment that is headed
south on the road along which Villa
was reported advancing, is one of
three sub-divisions operating south of
Casus Grandes. One column was sent
towards Luke itabrlcora, seventy
miles south of Casas Grandes, and
somewhat to the west. The other two
detachments moved as one to Gale
ana, south and cast of Casas Grandes,
and there separated, one continuing a
more easterly direction toward Car-j
men, sixtv-five miles from Casas
Grandes, and the other south toward
Las Cruces. fifty miles from Casas
Grandes, which now has become (he
advanced base of the expeditionary
forces.
Pershing's Whereabout Unknown.
Just where General Pershing is, was
not announced, but he Is directing (be
work of the three detachments and
by means of scouts Is attempting to
keep in communication.
It was known at headquarters, how
ever, that divergent directions will
make this difficult, also the moun
tainous character of tho county will
afford elevations that will make niore
feasible, communication by signalling.
From all points to which the three
detachments arc moving Villa has
been reported. Although it is realized
that he could not have been at til
points where he was said to have
been, the three detachments will be
so widely separated by the time they
have gone a short distance further
east that it was regarded as almost
certain that one of them would come
in contact with him. The force mov
ing toward Las Ciuces was only a
short distance north of Vulle, twenty
eight miles north of Las Cruces, this
afternoon.
Supplies Necessary.
The steady arid rapid advance of a
part of General Pershing's force into
Mexico has increased the desire of
those at army headquarters here to
be permitted to use the Northwestern
railway for moving supplies. Cruces,
ft point that probably will be reached
by one of the cavalry detachments, is
about 200 miles from the border, and
Lake llabicora a like distance. It
was pointed out that any delay in
getting supplies through the border
to Casas C raides, from where it an
be sent forward to the mobile units
operating soutr, of there, might Inter
fere seriously 'with General Persh
ing's plan of pursuit. General Fun
ston evinced no impatience but he did
show concern and expressed the hope
that Carranza would not misunder
stand the motive' for his request.
Delays Inevitable,
Even If the request Is granted it
will he some days, before the road can
be used because two points at least
repairs will tune to be made. Ameri
can rolling stock will have to be sent
across the line on account of Its lack
on the other sidi, and American
crews und dispatchers will be used.

General Pershing has advised (Ien
eral Funston that he has found qilau j

The question of occupying cities and

said one of the headquarters officials.

Washington, March 20. An official
report explaining that difficulty of
loading In the darkness was responsi
ble for the failure of he four weap
ons of the Thirteenth cavalry's ma
chine gun troop in the fight with Vil
la and bis bandits at Columbus was
received at. the war department to
day. Press dispatches telling of tho
guns jamming had caused Lrlgadier
General Cro.ler, chief of ordnance, to
order an Investigation.
The report, transmitted by tbe of
ficer commanding the machine guns
troop, through the headquarters of
the San Antonio arsenal, follows:
"The reason for the jamming of
the machine guns during the light
last Thursday morning was not the
failure of the mechanism to function
properly, but was due to the fact that
the night was dark and It was very
difficult to load the guns, ln load
ing the guns the feed strip has to be
inserted ina narrow slot or guide. If
the strip is not Inserted properly In
this guide, the gun will fire about
five shots anil will then Jain, This
happened to two of my guns us It was
so dark that It was almost impossible
10 get the strips In the slots. The
other two guns did not Jam and the
execution they did showed the value
of machine gun fire, The ammuni
tion was not reloaded 'and had been
manufactured since 1910. The ex
tractors are all model 1911."
General Crozier appeared to re
gard the explanation as satisfactory,
as the troopers were flghliug under!
the most adverse conditions, j
"No entirely satisfactory machine j
rifle has yet been developed," be
"l hat is. we have never had a

(By Morning Journal
El Paso, Tex., March 20.- The Car
ranclslns have failed to hold their cud
of the net that was closing 11 bout
l'ancho Villa nnd the bandit chief
has escaped to bis mountain haunts
ubout Guerrero, according to relia
ble information received here today.
The escape of the bandit, is, how
ever, far from being the most serl-
I ( a rranclslaH were not only failing to
co-operate, with the American troops,
hut, lit certain Instances at least, were
actually withdrawing from the field
of operations.
ICcrtisc to l ight Villa.
The Associated Press learned on
unquestionable authority that tbe
troops of the de facto government
which had hveii stationed at ('anas
Grandes have been withdrawn and
ure now in and about. Juarez. From
the sumo source, It was learned thai
al Igast nun detachment of Carranza
troops hud refused to fight Villa and
bad withdrawn on the bandit's ap
proach, leaving him free to pass int
bis favorite mountain fastnesses in
the greut continental divide south of
Nampiqulpa. This detachment with
drew oil leccipt of a message thai hu
was not waning on Mexicans but the
enemies of Mexicans.
Americans Move Rapidly.
The extraordinary rapidity with
Which (he American cavalry had
pushed Into Mexico gave rise to high
hopes yet that, tbe unexpected bail
happened and the notorious bandl:
was cornered. This seemed inevita
ble if the Carranza soldiers did their
part and if Hie account of the
strength of their field forces was cor
rect. Villa, cut off from the north
by the forward step of the American
column, from (lie west by (he Sierra
Madres barring' tbe approaches to the
slate of Sonora, was supposed to be
equally barred from cast and south
by powerful Carran.a forces. Those
hopes havo been completely crushed
by today's developments.
Moves AlMMit IVcly.
More than this, it now seems cer
tain that Villa is moving freely in at
1st a large section of Hie country
supposed to ! held by the troops of
the first chief. In the last few days
he has been variously reported by
General Gavira, the Carranza. com
mander iit Jiuiiej!, nt points iiloujr a

(liileana to Namiquipu, a distance of!
about seventy-five mip-s. ty the

operating adds ma Ay miles to the

If Is Impossible to make even a fair
psttmute of the number of men un
der General Gavira nt Juare. The
largo staff at his headquarters and
the fact that new troops are nrrlvliifr
dally Indicates that his force is a,
large one. The most conservative es
timate! places It at 3,000 snd calcula
tions range from that point up to
H.0O0. h'very precaution has been
taken to prevent the fuels being
known und most of th men are kept
outsidn the town among the hills.
Reports from Agua Prieta and OJIn
ga tell of Mexican reinforcements
reaching these points also, but noth
ing Is known hs to their numbers.
Cncashies at EJ Puso.
There Is no question thut there Is
serious and growing uneasiness In El
Paso which has been sharply accentu
ated by the problem which has arisen
over th requests of the l'nited Stales
governor to General Carnmaa for tho
use of (ho Mexican railroads to trans
port supplies. Americans hers do
not believe that Carranza dare, grant,
this request, especially b It Is tin-
(derstood that General Fiiniitou pro
poses. If it Is granted, to tune truth,
crews und supplies Into Mexico and
place military guards at the stations.
The presence of American soldiers on
Mexico railroads could not fall to brt
misunderstood by tho peons, and It In
feared, would be sure lo provoke out
breaks. ItaNroails Sorely Needed.
On (he other hand there are many
indications here that the Mexican rail
roads are sorely needed by tho Amer
ican military authorities to ship sup
plies to the troops in the field. At
the present time these supplies must
go forward over a desert and moun
tain trail by wagons and mules. Th
pressure is Intensified by the fact that
almost all the forage for the cavalry
horses must, be sent from the base, as
the corn and oats-fed mounts of tha
I'liited Stales troopers could not llv
on the diet that will support a Mex
ican pony. Ominous reports ar re
ceived here that the systems are al
ready overtaxed and It is believed this
situation causes, the deepest anxiety
and the most apprehension. This
anxiety has not been lessened by the
news that Carranza has deferred th
issue by a request for mort Informa
tion from the Washington govern
ment. 1
Garcia Optimistic.
At the same time Andres Garcia, Car
ranza consul here and known to be ln
intimate relations with the first chief,
maintains that there Is no danger of
friction over the question of the ship
ment of army supplies over tho Mex
ican railroads. As long as it was
merely a question Of supplies, Mr.
Garcia sl id today, it was a matter of
consequence, lie added, however,
that the passage of American sol
diers on Mexican trains would come
under a different category.
Sees Utile Danger.
"The Americans have permission to
buy supplies in Mexican towns." said
Garcia, "so I see little difference, so
far as the attitude of the Mexican.
