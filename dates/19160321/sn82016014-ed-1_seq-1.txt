Then are IS women In the conven
tion. Under a war cloud that threatens
open and new factional hostilities, del
egates in the Republican state con
vention this afternoon sought to evade
another preach anions the factions of
two and four years ago. Trouble in
the convention was made certain today
when friends of Willis J. Railey of
A tchison forced through the eonven
t Ion a resolution to give the former
governor privileges of the floor. The
move was opposed by anti Bailey-Hristow-
I lu r row delegates.
Before the convention toda Hailey
did not make an open declaration of
war. Yet he made clear his desire
and platiM to go to the national con
vention as a mnmlrer of the Big Four.
Sixth district delegates had previously
caucused and effort was made to hind
the delegations under a resolution to
support the Bristow- Bailey-Burrow
slate. Many delegates refused to be
loinil.
Cheered tppeads for Harmony.
delegates who today cheered the
appeals for harmony did not dodge
the issue when danger of a fight over
delegates at large was presented.
Both Charles P. Scott, representing
t be harmony program advanced by
W. Y. Korean, and W J. Bailey, rep
resenting the Bristow - Burrow pro-
rani, addressed the delegates during
the organization of the convention. A
dozen delegates quietly protested
against calling Scott to the stage.
E. K. Mullaney, who sat as a dele
gate from Graham county, started the
first open revolt, however, when he
i'sked that Bailey be given the privi
leges of the floor. Mullaney is cam
paign manager for J. U. Burrow,
candidate 'or national committeeman.
1 1 was the first split in the conven
tion and the Railey crowd won. The
convention then took an hour's recess
to eat and lay war plans.
Occupy First Floor,
The !62 delegates to the convention
occupied virtually the entire first floor
of the auditorium. There were less
than -00 visitors in the big hall when
Charles Sessions, vice chairman of the
state committee, called the convention
to order. For 1 5 minutes the dele
gates forgot their factional troubles
and displayed patriotism during a con
cert by the Knignts and Ladies of Se
curity band.
Beaulons Kap- ilon.
In calling the convention to order,
Sessions rapped the policies of the
Wilson administration and the presi
dent's stand on foreign affairs.
"Four years ago they said we were
dead," declared Sessions'. "But be
hold the resurrection here today. We
have come here to make our first ex
pression of our opinion of a president
who has kept out of war with every
one except congress."
Kansas Republicans are in the best
fighting order in years. Sessions told
the delegates. Not only is the party
united. Sessions said, but it is in better
condition for a fight than at any time
in recent years.
"We are going into the fight this
year to fight under our own banner
a nd under our own name and we
ire going to win," said Sessions in his
closing remarks.
I A ry County Responded.
Kvery county in the state responded
to the roll call by Secretary Glasco
It was an unusual showing in a state
convention. Probably ninety of the
105 counties reported full delegations
in the convention.
Judge Klrick Cole of Great Bend
was nominated for chairman of the
convention. He was the only candi
date before ihe convention and his
election was by acclamation. His elee
11 oil was in keeping with the harmony
program.
Consult Wifey
When Choosing
Your New Suit
St. Louis, Mo.. March 21. Dors
your wife select your clothes,
huh? Of course you'd say "No!"
But she should. Because you
don't know what matches your
complexion and build. A com
mittee of the National Tailors'
association said so here today.
And if a tailor doesn't know, who
does? The tailor admitted that
next to tho wife the tailor was
the only person who knew just
what you needed, even though
you didn't want it.
Men's poor selection is not con
fined to suits. If you want that
heavenly pink silk shirt you'd bet
ter consult Mrs. Wife. It might
not "go" well with your yellow
cane.
Harmony was tho one big word In
Judge Cole's speech of acceptance. He
urged both standpatters to forget their
former troubles and get together for
the 1916 campaiTti.
Judge Cole's apper Speech.
"I have only contempt for any man
who will not eliminate himself In this
fight in the interest of harmony." de
clared Cole in a burst of applause from
harmony advocates In the convention.
The Great Bend man was most bitter
and severe in his criticism and con
demnation of the Democrats. Their
mistakes and faults insure a Republi
can victory in November, he told the
d elegates.
"The people of this nation want a
man in the White House who will not
permit the stars and stripes to be
scoffed and scorned in every nation
in the world. They want a Republi
can." McLaughlin. Secretary.
Drew McLaughlin was elected secre
tary of the convention. He was elect
ed by acclamation. Karl Richter of
Wichita, was elected assistant secre
tary. He is a son of the late Harry
Richter. former lieutenant governor.
Following the formal organization,
James Challis of Atchison, offered the
champion short resolution of the
world. It was adopted with a whoop.
This was the Challis resolution: 'The
Republican party is."
A telegram containing greetings
from Charles Cartls. United States
senator, was read bv chairman Cole.
i Senator Curtis predicted a Republican'
victory in November and regrett
that affairs !n Washington prevented
his attendance.
SmtCs Horrible Kxample.
Charles F. Scott of lola, talked Re
publicanism while Chairman Cole se
lected delegates for various commit
tees. "It is always easy to make a Repub
lican speech after the Democratic par
ty has been in power three or four
years.' said Scott. "For that reason
we should feel friendly to the Demo
crats for furnishing a horrible ex
ample." Scott was most severe in his denun
ciation of President Wilson's Mexican
policy.
"No president could plunge us into
war without the voice or consent of
our people," said the lola man. "Had
such action been possible, however, we
would have been at war with Mexico
long ago."
Bailey Fought to Speak.
Ed Mullaney, formerly of Hill City,
precipitated the first trouble in the
convention when he asked that Willis
J. Bailey of Atchison, former governor,
be allowed the privilege of the floor
for ten minutes. Cries of "No, no,"
'came from all sections of the hall. A
vote was taken. "hairman Cole said
the vote for KaiJey's speech bad car
ried. A rising vote was demanded.
Bailey's followers won.
Then the delegates in the conven
tion sat back for the fight which they
felt might be precipitated by Bailey's
speech.
"I have been a Republican in pros
perity and adversity," said Bailey with
a ring of sarcasm and feeling in his
voice. "I don't know any rule which
should rule me out of the right to
make a Republican speech."
A Plea for Peace.
Instead of starting with a war
declaration. Bailey pleaded for peace.
He urged unison of factions and par
ties in facing the Mexican troubles.
"Whether right or wrong, I am
with the boys who have gone into
Mexico," Bailey said. "It has been
easy to go into Mexico, but I fear it
may be hard to come back.
Show Right Spirit to Mooee,
"It doesn't make much difference
who you send to Chicago," said the
Atchison man in getting back to Kan
sas issues. "You may deny my hopes
and ambitions. But, remember, those
men who go to Chicago will go with
a responsibility never greater than
since the days of Lincoln.
'If you are going to win in this
j tight, though, you must use the open
! arm not the clenched list. If we
i are going to win. you must show the
i right spirit toward the Progressives.
I do not mean to give them the loaves
and fishea But your action today
j means more than a house to house
campaign all during the campaign.
lour action today means everything
in the tight next November. You can't
make it too hard for me. But those
who have been away must be consid
ered." Bailey left the floor with applause
from every section of the hall. He had
failed to throw scrap iron in the ma
chinery. Committee members weer named by
Chairman Cole just before the ad
journment for lunch. The commit
tee members were:

BRISTOW JUMPS
IN AND IMPERILS
HARMONY PLAN
Refused to Compromise With
Fifth District Delegates.
Party Leaders Look for a Fight
on Convention Floor.
HANNA OFFERS PEACE TERMS
Former Senator Wouldn't Listen
to Neighbor's Fifty-Fifty.
State Republicans Called to Or
der at Noon Today.
Joseph L. Bristow wrecked Repub
lican harmony plans today when ho
refused to permit Fifth district dele
gates to decide whether he or George
W. Ha una should withdraw from the
fight for delegate at large to the na
tional convention. Bristow S refusal
was accepted by party leaders as an
indication of a fight on the floor.
With obstinate determination Bris
tow insisted his name should go be
fore the convention. Supporters of J.
R. Burrow, candidate for national
c-.nmitteeman. rushed to Bristow' s
support. They immediately urged an
alignment with Willis J. Bailey of
Atchison, a Burrow supporter. The
combination was made to defeat F.
Williams of Columbus, slated as a cer
tain choice of the convention as dele
gate. The secondary combination
was to beat T. D. Smith of Hiawatha
and Hanna of Clay Center.
Declaration of War.
Bristow's refusal to accept the
Hanna peace offering was a virtual
declaration of war. It meant a wide
open split in the Fifth district delega
tion and that the men who had plead
ed loudest for harmony were first to
refuse the olive branch. Tn suite of
the Bristow-Bailey-Burrow slate, W.
Y. Morgan and regulars and progres
sives who joined last week in the mak
ing of a harmony program, declared
they would go into the convention
without a change in their plans.
Morgan had previously declared for
both Scott and Williams.
Both Hanna and r?ristow are resi
dents of the Fifth district. last week
the Fifth district endorsed Hanna as
a delegate. It is impossible, under
common rules, for a congressional dis
trict to win two p races on the Big
Four. The Roosevelt men of four
years ago demanded one of the places
on the delegation. The regulars with
drew the Mulvane Issue and granted
their request. Then Hanna went to
Bristow and offered to submit their
candidacies to the delegates from their
congressional district. Both Bristow
and Hanna had supported Roosevelt
in 1912 and the Hanna plan provided
that the loser before the district dele
gates should throw his support to the
winner and withdraw from the fight.
Bristow refused.
He lla- a Right to Run.
'I made my offer tn good faith."
said Hanna. "My district has en
dorsed me. I have a right to run a
far better right, it seems to me, than
Bristow. But if the delegates prefer
red Bristow to me, I was willing to get
out and throw my support to Bristow.
He wouldn't do it. Now I propose to
make a finish fight."
A MEX PROTOCOL
Hew Agreement With Carranza
for Villa Chase.
Will Reply. Telling First Chief
Number of Invaders.
Washington, March 21.- President
Wilson and his cabinet today decided
to accept a proposal for a protocol
between the United States and the de
facto government of Mexico for co
operation in the pursuit of General
Villa and his outlaws.
General Carranza has asked the
United States the number of American
troops to be employed in the Villa
hunt.
This, it became known today, is one
of the questions Carranza had put to
the state department in connection
with the proposed protocol under
which the hunt probably will proceed,
1 n reply, he will be informed, it is
said, that the expedition is only large
enough to accomplish its known mis
sion and this government has no in
tent to pursue military' operations be
yond that.
President Wilson and the cabinet to
day agreed this government should as
sent to General Carranza's suggestion
that the Villa hunt in Mexico be car
ried on under a formal working
agreement. A message to that effect
was sent Carranza late today.

Will Convene Again in April to
Finish Job.
Chicago. March 21. The suh-com-mittee
on arrangements' cf the Repub
lican national committee adjourned
today without taking action on the
election of a temporary chairman for
the national convention here next
June. The sub-committee will meet
ujuin at the call of the chair about the
middle of A aril.
Five names were prominently before
the committee. They were Representa
tive James R. Mann of Illinois; Sena
tor Warren (I. Harding of Ohio; P.k
Knox of Pennsylvania: former iiiver
nor Herbert S. Hadley of Missouri, and
Nicholas Murray Butler, president of
Columbia university. New York. None
was believed to have the support of
all the committee when the session
began.
Hadflcy a I a vorite.
A tendency to eliminate those re
garded a presidential aspirants was
said to prevail among the committee
men and this was regarded as mitigat
ing against the chances of the selec
tion falling on former Governor Had
ley who ranks as a favorite son. Con
gressman Mann it was pointed out is
a pronounced stalwart and is in dis
favor with the woman suffrage forces
and with the leaders of the anti-saloon
movement.
Early in the discussion it was re
ported that opinion was tending to
ward Senator Harding and his selec
tion seems probable.
Kansas Member Absent.
Chairman Hilles shortly after the
session opened sent telegrams to the
three absent members of the sub-committee,
Fred Stanley, Kansas; Thomas
K. Niedringhaus, Missouri, and E. C.
Duncan. North Carolina, asking for an
expression of their opinion on the
selection of a temporary chairman.
Franklin Murphy, who yesterday said
"The wisest leaders of the party seem
to think that Colonel Roosevelt could
not be elected if he were nominated,"
and added that he did not think Colo
nel Roosevelt would be seriously con
sidered by the convention said todav:
"Recent letters written by Colonel
Roosevelt indicate that he is verv much
a candidate. He has several admirable
qualities. He sticks to his friends."
William F. Stone, of Baltimore, was
elected sergeant at arms for the June
convention.
FIRST DAY OF SPRING
Vernal Season Is Cohered In With
June Temperature.
June weather prevails today, with
clear skies and high temperature. The
mercury Monday mounted 3 degrees
higher than ever before on March 20
and it was expected to jump high to
day, although no records will be brok
en. A somewhat lower temperature
is expected tonight, with a discontin
uation of fair weather. Nothing se
vere is in sight and no storms are pre
dicted. The forecast calls for unsettled and
ooler weather tonight; partly cloudy
and cooler Wednesday. Above freez
ing temperatures are indicated for 3t
hour shipments in all directions by
the shippers" forecast.
The lowest temperature this i-orn-ing
was 49 degrees at 7 o'clock. The
mercury immediately started on the
climb and the rise was rapid. There
was no chance, to break any records
for today as the high reading is 91
degrees, established in 1907. The low
est temperature ever recorded on
March '21 is 12 degrees. This reading
occurred in 1913.
The wind Is still in the southeast,
blowing at the rate of 15 miles an
hour. The Kaw river continues to
drop at the rate of one-tenth of a
foot a day, making the stage today
6.5 feet.
The mercury' ascended by leaps and
bounds today, and the average tem
perature was 25 degrees above normal.

Sidelights
on the
State Convention
Vinton Stilling, state senator from
Leavenworth county and one of the
deaps of the upper branch of the
state legislature, is with the Leaven
worth delegation. Senator Shillings
; will le a candidate for re-election
: next fall.
Frank Yantis, he of the jitney rail
i road fame, is a delegate to the state
: convention from Scott scounty. Yantis
i became a state wide character dur
ing the 1915 legislature when he
lobbied for the passage of the bill
which would allow a five cent a mile
passenger rate on his railroad from
Scott City to Winona.
Cyrus Leland of Troy, is here. But
' Leland is not here today to dominate
! the convention. There was no Le
j land machine and no Leland slate 'in
'evidence in the discussion of delegates
i to the national convention. It is the
pame Uncle Cy Leland of other days
; who is here for the convention. But it
is the Uncle Cy Leland, who was
some yea rs ago shorn of his power
and whose machine was wrecked in
the boss buster crusade.
Frank Ponaeroy and wife are at
tending the convention from Jackson
county. Pomeroy was a member of
the house during tho last session and
made a good record. He will prob
' ably be a candidate for the senate
i from the Atchison-Jackson county
J district this year.
Senator C. S. Huffman of Cherokee
i county, is a delegate to the state con
' vention. Huffman has served four
terms or sixteen years in the senate.
I He will probably be returned for a
! fifth term without serious opposition.
Otis L. Benton of Oberlin, candi
I date for congress in the Sixth district
is attending the convention as a spec
tator. Benton today denied reports of
a Burrow -Benton compromise in his
district last wnek. "1 am just running
j for congress and not looking after the
! other fellow's fights," said Benton.
I "1 didn't make a fignt over the dele
! gation in my district. Why should T?"
Charges that Benton and Burrow en
; tered into an agreement after a four
j teen year row were common gossip
j among political leaders last week,
j Many of Benton's friends supported
j Burrow, who was thirs able to win an
j instructed delegation.
Senator Walter E. Wilson of Wash
; ington county, is a delegate to the
convention. He will probably be a
candidate for re-election next fall.
i Bert Brown of Fall River, repre
sentative from Greenwood county, is
a member of his home county delega-
; tion. Brown made a high grade rec
ord in his session of 19 15 and is doped
; for renomination without opposition.
t His re-election also seems certain.
Henry Ganse of Emporia, is here.
Ganse was state senator from the Cof
1 fey-Franklin county district in 1909
! 11. Recently his name was mentioned
I as a harmony candidate for congress
; in the Fourth district. "I am not a
' candidate and do not expect to run,"
. said Ganse
Lacey Simpson of Mcpherson
, county, sat in the convention as a
delegate. He was a member of the
1913-15 state senate, but will not be
a candidate for re-election. Harvey
county will name the candidate this
year.
Tom Thompson of Howard, is
heading the delegation from Elk
county. Thompson, who is one of the
most widely quoted publishers in Kan
sas, has attended nearly every" state
convention in a score of years. He
is known by almost every politician
in the state and is regarded as one
of the strong men in the Third district.

Dr. S. C. Arnold, chief surgeon for
Villa in 1914-1915. who has arrived
here from Mazatlan.
Dr. Arnold said Villa would find

by the Germans who took 2,500 pri
soners the war office announced to
day. The Germans before Verdun are
making a strong drive at the French
left flank well toward the border of
the neighboring Argonne region and
have gained ground south of Malan
court some ten miles northwest of
Verdun. Their first attacks took
them into the Malancourt woods and
today official statement from Paris
shows them to have pushed some dis
tance further southward occupying
the Avocourt wood, the southern
section id the Malancourt wooded dis
trict. The attacks have been made with
important forces, with the support of
a heavy bombardment by shells of
large caliber and the throwing of
liquid fire by detachments carrying
special devices for the purpose. The
Germans attempted a further advance
southward but according to Paris their
attempts to debouch from the Avo
court wood were failures.
Persian City of 80.000.
A news agency dispatch from Te

garrisoned, and are laying siege to the
city.
Ispahan is one of the important
cities of Persia with a population of
some 80,000. It is 218 miles southeast
of Teheran.
The foregoing dispatch indicates a
Russian movement further to the south
than has been reported hitherto. Rus
sian forces after the capture of Hama
dan advanced southwest towards Ker
manshah, in the direction of the Turk
ish frontier The army now reports
at Ispahan evidently striking south
ward from the main Russian forces in
the direction in the Persian gulf.
Russ Victory in Galacia.
The Russians have won an impor
tant success in southeast Galicia,
where Vienna admits that the Aus
trian bridgehead at Uscieczko on the
Dniester, about forty miles northwest
of Czernowitz, has been evacuated
under the heavy Russian pressure. The
Austrian force there was trapped but
cuts its way through Uscieczko which
the Russians held and joined other
Austrian forces near Zale Czczky fur
ther south on the Dniester.
The Italians have resumed heavy
attacks at the Tolmino bridgehead,
Vienna, reporting the repulse of as
saults against Mrzlievrh and Krn with
losses to the Italians of machine guns
and numerous of men taken prisoner.
The Austrians themselves captured a
position at Ronson and made addi
tional captures there. At Gorizio
bridgehead where there has been in
tense artillery fire the Austrian
ejected the Italians from a trench.
Seven lestroyers Battle.
A skirmish between four British
and three German torpedo boat de
stroyers occurred yesterday off the
Belgian coast. The London official
account says the German destroyers
turned as the British sighted them "and
ran for Zeebrugge, the British craft
pursuing and shots being exchanged in
a running fight. Two German boats
were hit the statement says. Four
men on the British destroyers were
wounded.
The German version of the engage
ment declares that it was broken off
by the British who steamed away at
full speed after they had received sev
eral direct hits and the Germans suf
fered unimportant damage.
Rioting has occurred at Tullamore,
Ireland, where Sinnfein rioters fired
on the police, three of whom wero
wounded. Conditions in some parts
of Ireland have reeenly been reported

custom which has occasioned an an
nual dinner to the commoner.
When Bryan arrived in Topeka to
day, he was taken at once to the Na
tional hotel. There the famous Ne
braska Democrat fought his way
through a lobby crowded with Kan
sas Republicans who are in Topeka
for the state convention. In his at
titude toward a number of the
policies of the Wilson administration,
Bryan and the leaders in today's Re
publican convention can harmonize.
It was because of the Wilson foreign
policies that Bryan refused to stay in
the cabinet and resigned as secretary
of state. His speech tonight will deal
with the European war and the situa
tior in Mexico. He will fpeak tonight
at the high school auditorium. Pre
ceding the high school meeting he will
make- a short talk before the Current
Topics club at the T. M. C. A. His
first speech will be at 6:30 o'clock.
"The grape juice banquet" for
Bryan by the Current Topic club
threatens to double the membership
of the club. Owing, however, to the
limited space only the present mem
bers and a few invited guests and
newspaper men are to be invited to
the dinner.
Bryan will speak at 6:30 before the
Current Topic club and will be rushed
over to the Auditorium at 7.30. The
topic of his talk before the Current
Topic club has not yet been announced
but it is understood it will be a "peace
talk."

here today.
I Since the Carranzista force under
Colonel Cano was last night reported
I to have engaged the Villistas near

j were also unheard from here.
That Vilra has "given them the
'slip" was not certain, bat authority

flanked both the Americans and Car
ranzistas. The bandits engaged just
east of Namiquipa are now believed
to have been part of Villa's 1.500 men
who were recently reported in the
vicinity of Bochiniva. and San Geroni

believed to be in another part of
Guerrera mountain, although his ex

known to officials in Juarez and Bl

I'ear Villa's Influence.
Considerable apprehension was
shown over the announcement 1p
Juarez that communication with
points near Namiquipa, over the Mexi
co Northwestern line, had been cut.
Before trace of Villa wa. lost It was
learned that Villa, instead of disband

El Paso, March 21. Further news
of the battle reported to have been
waged late yesterday near Nami
quipa between Carranza troops and a
force of bandits led by Villa, was im
patiently awaited along the border to
day. If Villa has be, n :f Me To break
through the Carranza line at Nansl
quipa the way Is open for a flight into
northern Chihuahua or the bandit
leader can proceed eastward into the
fastnesses of the high ranges, shutting;

Interest was shown in wireless dis
patches from the front stating that si
biplanes of the First aero squadron
commanded by Ca ptain Ben (ami n D.
Foulois had joined the American ex

very likely to locate him. If he haa

No uneasiness is felt here regarding
