Community Problems Discussed
at Local Dinner Last Evening
Reports on work in progress or con
templated b) various local organiza
tions were given at an enjoyable din
ner given last evening at the Hotel
Pendleton with Clarence M. Bishop,
vice president of the Commercial As
sociation, as the host. The program
as previously published was followed
with the exceptions that W. L.
Thompson was unable to be present
and William Lowell supplanted J. P
McManua Upon the program. A trio
composed ol Mrs. Pruitt. Miss Bald
win and Mr. steelhammer provided
music for the occasion and their play
ing added much to the pleasure ol
the occasion.
Ceorge M Hyland of Portland w a--invited
I .Mr Bishop to serve as
toast master and did so In most cred
itable manner In an enthusiastic
talk Mr. Hyland said he had just
heard Pendleton praived bj a world
traveler as the cleanest small cit ho
had ever visited. He emphasized
the necessity of active work in order
to foster the growth that will natur
ally come as the result of Pendleton'
geographical position, which he char
acterized as the best of any inland city
Spokane not excepted.
The talks by the vurtous speakers
contained information and suggestions
of , such value to the community that

the talk by Mayor J. A. Best:

Mr. Toast master. Ladles and Qantle-
men:
To sive you a complete outline of
the city administration In five min
utes the time allotted for each l peak
Si Mould be impossible. I will there,
fore mention a few or the ni"st Im
portant facts
In the first place, ns long as the
good people of Pendleton use the
same judgment In selecting council
inen like we h ive at the present time.
I would be opposed to commission
form of government why Mr Toaet
master, it would cost the taxpayers
of Pendleton not less ttlan I II'. 000 .1
year to procure the services of these
men. My plan Is to be careful In se
lecting en h committee, and then
place the burden of the responsibility
on the committees, and each member
of the council is a cnalrman of some
one of the committees In that way
we have an eight cornered working
machine, and If you don't think they
work Just visit the city council Wed
nesday evenings and see for yourselt.
The city revenue has been dimin
ished some 111,000 this year, hut we
are confident that Pendleton will go
forward Just the same with the same
enthusiasm, energy and spirit that it
has always shown.
The street improvement work Is
getting under way: parting and beau,
tlfylng the homes will be encouraged.
A scheme is on hand to build a
iurnace or crematory to take cure of
the debris. Our fire cntef is ever on
the alert to see that proper care is
taken in his department and Is also
looking after the sanitary condition
which I hope in the near future will
be above censure.
1'nder Mr. Taylors supervision the
cemetery Is being beautified and in
the near future will he a credit lo
Pendleton, something that has here
tofore been overlooked.
We intend repairing the levee this
summer, so there will be comparative
ly no danger of floods In the future.
The natat. rium committee will con-

place Pendleton's systems second to
none on the coast, and I have received
between Ihe clly administration atij
the other associations or Pendleton. A
move to that effect is started ai d I
am sure we will succeed.
Pendleton has the best people, baa)
banks, the best business men, the
cleanest and most up-to-date huel teas
methods In the state and during nit
administration I expect to make pen

ing recognized as such, "ur laws are

be, and at the end of 1917 Pendleton
will be the biggest, cleanest, most up-to-date
and happiest place In Oregon.
