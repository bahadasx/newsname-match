WASHINGTON. March 20. The de
facto government of Mexico todty pro-j
posed to the United States the draft- j
ing cf a picotocpl, under which Ameri-;
can and Mexican troops may help in
running to earth Villa and his bandits,
without danger of misunderstanding
or conflict. These facts became known
at the meeting between Eliseo Arre
dondo. Mexican ambassador designate,
ar,d Acting Secretary Polk of the Stala
Department. Negotiations as to the
detp.ils will be in progress for several
days but the two governments are in
agreement on the general prrincipals
involved. j
The troops of the de facto govern-
ment are moving with the Americaa
forces, according to information re-
reived at the War Dcnartment and
pre planning to render even greater
assistance. High military officials al
lowed it to be known that the Carran
7a government had promised to move
a large force of its troons from central
Mexico to the north, forming a trap
into which the American cavalry, un
der Gen. Pershing, may chase Villa.
Daring the day disturbing -eports
came to the War Department from
On. Funston regarding conditions at
?."og.Me Sonora. There, pn official

ensjatrod in making incendiary, anar

General Pershing, in a delayed de

ment laie todriy. renorted that at Co
lttn.bus Villa lost 100 men, which in
cludes killed and wounded.
Arredondo is understood fo have re
ceived instructions from Gen. Carran
7?i to discus the request with the
State Department and to propose the
E.rreement.
While the convention will provide
for all matters, such as the use of the
Mexican railroads by American troops
the specific request for permission to
ship supplies from El Paso will he dis

has asked for additional information
unon that subject and it will te for

After his conference with Mr. Polk,
Mr. Arredondo started to prepare a
tentative draft of the agreement which
will be submitted to Gen. Carranza as
soon as an agreement on the details
is reached 'with the State Department.
Every effort will be made to expe

, WASHINGTON. March 20. Busi
ness of the eastern railroads of the
I'nited States has doubled within 12 J
months, according to figures made pub
lic today by the Interstate Commerce
Commission. The southern railroads
increased 50 per .e.it within this
period and the western roads added
about 15 per cent. These comparison
show that the eastern roads received
an average net revenue of $609 per
mile operated, compared with $307 per
mile a year previously. The southern
roads made $4-0 per mile against
$225 in 1915 and the western roads
$210 per mile against $187. Experts
attribute the wide disparity in the
railroads between eastern and western
roads largely to the poor showing of
trailroads in Texas, Oklahoma, New
Mexico and Arizona.
The railroads' experts are now seek
ing to learn why southwestern roads
have failed to respond proportionate
ly to the general revival of prosperity
throughout the country.
Today the southern roads are niore

OFFICERS OPPOSE PLAN.
WASHINGTON. March 20. Army
officers, it became known tonight, are
strongly opposed to the plan to use
postmasters as recruiting officers and
an effort will be made to elimina!
the resolution for this reason. It was
recently inserted in the Senate army
bill. The War Department favors, in
stead, of having the postmasters au
thorized to co-operate with the recduit
Ing stations by notifying the officers
of citizens in their districts who
would be eligible for soldiers.
expedition force now under General
Pershing somewhere in Chihuahua was
not indicated by the military authori
ties here. . '
Accompanying the troops were a
nu'cber of American civilian scouts,
said to know the mountain truls in
Chihuahua, in which Villa is reported
to be fleeing, as the city man knows
his front yard. Wearing the sombrero
of the frontier, heavily roweled spurs,
and with little wrinkles at the corners
of their eyes, bespeaking lives spent
in the open, these scouts form what
is said to be the most picturesque
group of men in the expeditionary
force.
Military men frankly admit tint up
on their knowledge of the district in
which Villa is reported to be fleeing,
rests the hope of the capture of the
bandit. It is these volunteers, many
of whom Villa drove from their homes
and property in Mexico, that are lead
ing the American columns to the wat
er holes and to the hiding places in
the mountains.

SAN ANTONIO. March 20. The
steady and rapid advance of a ,'art of
General Pershing's force Into Mexico
has increased the desire of those at
army headquarters to use the Mexican
railroads for moving troops and sup
plies through to Casas Grandes.
American rolling stock will have to
be sent on account of its lack n the
other side and American crews and
dispatchers will be used.
"The reasons for these are obvious"
said an army officer tonight.' Gen.
Funston has made it plain to the War
Department that his only desire ti
use the road is for the transportation
of supplies to the troops south of ihe

EL PASO. March 20 The Carran
cistas have failed to hold their end
of the net that wa closing around
Pancho Villa and the bandit chief has
reached his mountains near Guerrero,
according to reliable information re
ceived here today.
At the capital the Associated learn
ed on questionable authority that
troops of the de facto government,
which had been stationed at Casas
Grandes, had been withdrawn and
from the same source learned that at
least one detachment of Carranza
troops refused to fight Villa and had
withdrawn on the bandit's approach,
letting him free to pass into his fav
orite mountain fastnesses of Manii
quipa. The extraordinary speed with which
the American cavalry has pushed into
Mexico gave rise to high hopes yester
day that the unexpected had happen
ed: that the bandit was cornered. This
seemed inevitable if the drrr.na sol
diers did their part and if the accounts
of the strength of their columns was
correct. Those hopes have been com
pletely dashed by the late news.
In the last few day Villa has been
variously reported by Gen. Gavira.
Carranza commander, at points along
a line reaching north and south from
Galena to Namiquipa, a distance of
about 75 miles.' By the same accounts
he has not been moving south but rov
ing north and east. The mountainous,
canyon-split, roadless country in
which he is operating adds many
miles to the country he has covered,
as compared with the maps.
The reason for the Carranza troop.
moving to the border remains unex
plained. It is impossible even to nuke
a fair estimate of the number of nn-n
under Gen. Gavira at Juarez. The
large staff at his headquarters an I
the fact that the new troops are ar
riving daily imlicat that his force has,
at a most conservative estimate, near
3.000 and calculations range from
that point upward to 8.000.
Every precaution has been taken to
prevent the fact being known and
most of the men are kept outside the
town among the hills. Reports from
Agua Priela tell of Mexican soldiers
having been sent to those points also
out nothing said of their number.
There is serious and growing un
easiness in in Paso over the problem
which has arisen over the request of
the United States government to the
Mexican authorities to use the Mexi
can railways. The presence of Ameri
can soldiers on board migut be mis
understood by the Mexicans.
The prei-mre is intense as most all
of the forage for the cavalry horsvs
has to be sent in wagons from the
bases. Corn and oats-led mounts of
I'nited States troopirs could not live
on tlie grass and herb that suppi it
range horses in Mexico. This anxiety
has not been lessened b the fact
that Carranza has deferred the issue
by a request for more information
from the Washington government.
