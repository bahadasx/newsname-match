BERLIN TURNS
DOWN PLAN TO
LCT U. S. PROBE
'MURDER' CASE
ReJects'Grey's Proposal to Sub
mit Charge That Sailors
Were Killed in Cold Blood to
Americans.
Announces It Will Adopt Methods
of Reprisal for Death of Sub
marine Crew To Send No
More Notes.
BERLIN (via wireless to Say
irille), Jan. 15. The German gov
ernment today rejected the sug
gestion made by Sir Edward Grey,
British foreign minister, that the
Baralong case, in which officers
of a British steamer were accused
of the murder of a German sub
marine crew, be submitted to in
vestigation by a court of Ameri
ican naval officers.
The text of the German note
transmitted to Great Britain
through the American embassy,
was made public here today. It
denies British charges that Ger
man soldiers and sailors have been
-fetiilty of inhuman practices, and
informs Great Britain thaHGor-roany-will
adopt methods of re
prisal for thfc alleged cold, blooded
murder of- the German submarine
crew. .
WANTED U. S. COURT.
Grant TOrltnln fw... m t.Ml t
Baralong case to an American tribunal
if Germany consented at the same time
to submit three cases of alleged Ger-i
man brutality to the same neutral court. '
"The German government must reject
as Inapplicable tho British proposal to
mibmlt these three cases, with the Bara
long case, to Investigation by a court
of American naval officers," It was
stated. "The German government takes
the standpoint that the charges against
members of German forces must be In
vestigated by Its own competent author
ities and that these give every ossur- t
since of an unprejudiced verdict, where
necessary for Just punishment. It has '
advanced no other renuest in th ni-
Ish ''government in the Baralong case,
not dotfbtlng for the moment that a
court-martial composed of British naval
officers would decree suitable punish
ment for thin cowardly and perfidious
crime. This request was tho more ult
avblu because Iho affidavits of Ameri
cans, therefore neutral, witnesses sub
mitted to the British government, placed
tho guilt of the commander of the crew
of the Baralong practically beyond
lIOUDu
Representations At End.
Tho German government adds that
Ince the British government has an
swered its "request' evasively, thereby in
dicatfng its desire "to no longer ob
serve against Geiman submarines ono
of the first rules of war namely, to
paro enemies when Incapacitated for
further action." it will niako no fur
ther representations in the Baralong
case.
'The British governmont having re
filled expiation for this outrageous In
cident, the German government feels
compelled to take tho punishment for
this unatoned crime into its own hands
and adopt measures of reprisal cor
responding," the note concluded.
Daniels Makes Plea for
Navy and Merchant Ships
NEW YORK, Jan. IB. Secretary of

before the National Democratic Club,
pleaded for a merchant marine and a

Abroad, particularly to countries on the
Western hemisphere, and we must
strengthen the navy, not for aggres

merce and American diplomacy the

thnt the United States Government will

While officials show no Inclination to

of these documents, which were given
out by the British government before
they were turned over to Mr. Page for

It was declaiod that von Papen. as

follow that the embassy had any

BERLIN (via wireless to Say ville), Jan. 15. Kais
er Wilhelm addressed a manifesto to the German people
today, asking them to celebrate his birthday on January

Whoever wishes to give special expression to his
feelings is urged by the Emperor to do so by gifts that
may heal the wounds inflicted by the war and may help
soldiers' families. The Kaiser's manifesto in part
follows:
"It is still necessary that the heart thoughts and the
strength of the German nation at the front and at home
must be directed toward one great aim, to gain definite vic
tory and win a peace which, as far as the human mind can
conjecture, permanently safeguards the country against a
repetition of hostile attacks."

Done to Relieve Situation.
Women will wear uncolored Easter

quickly relieved, witnesses told the
Ways and Means Committee today.
Men's suits require 200.000 yards of cloth
for spring and summer, they said, and
present prospects are for a 13 per cent
underproduction because of dye short
age. Prof. Herty. of the American Chemi
cal Society, told of an alleged threat
made by an English maker of dyes on
jh Benzol Products Company. The
Englishman agreed that If Uio Amer
ican firm quit manufacturing European
makers would sell aniline oil to them at
a price making present contracts profit
able. Otherwise, European dye makers
were determined that the American en
terprise should bo "nipped In the bud"
by selling European products below
cost.
George W. Wilkie, of New York, gave
one Instance of dyes bought by his com
pany costing $1,748 before tho war, nnd
for which since the war $52,000 was paid.

Expected to Show Whether
Promises Didn't Come From
This Government.
After careful inquiry of its rep
resentatives at El Paso and
Jaurer, officials of the State De
partment, it was learned 'today,
are convinced that the seventeen
Americans and one Canadian
massacred last Monday at Santa
Ysobel by Villista bandits went to
their death under assurances from
the Carranza authorities that they
would not be molested. .
Officials of the department arc
also convinced from reports which
have been received that "General
Obregon, Carranza's commander
at Chihuahua city, not only issued
these assurances through the
Mexican consul at El Paso and
the Mexican commander at Jaurez.
but that he actually invited the
Americans to return to their
properties.
INVITED TO RETURN.
It also appears from these report?
that the Carranza authorities had nre-
vloualv Invited offl rem nnrf emnlnve of
the American Mining and Smelting Com

and other parts of the state of Chihua

The conclusions reached regarding the
existence of the assurances are expect

in determining the extent to, which the
American Government mav in the fu

Officials of the department mani
fested no small amount of concern to
day cer the publication of a report
from El Paso quoting Consul Ed
wards, the American representative
at Juarez, as stating that Gen. Ga
briel Gavira, Carranza commander ar
Juarez, had granted to him guaran
tees for a special ttaln for wnlch C
I. Watson, manager of tho Cusl Min
ing; Company, and tho others who
were massacred, after a request, for
the train had been made of him.
Said It Would Be Safe.
In company with Mi Watson. Ed
wards was quoted as saying-, he called
on General Gavira and the lattor said
It would be perfectly safe for the
Americans to make the Journey. Also.
Edwards said, they were assured of
every guarantee of their safety b
the Carranza government.
Consul Edwards was further quoted
as stating that he had been Instructed
from Washington to get a guaranteo
to Carranza officials for tho Americans
returning to the mines.
After a length conference with Sec
retary Lansing, Chairman W'l'lam
Stone, of the Senate Torelgn Relations
