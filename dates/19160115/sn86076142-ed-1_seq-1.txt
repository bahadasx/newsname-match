MISHAPS TO COASTERS
CHIEF ASKS THAT CAUTION BE
EXERCISED WHILE TH"
SPORT CONTINUES
Now that roasting is In its prime
and every kid in town seems to be
possessed of a sled, the glassy smooth
ness of Iirougher and Ilryan ave
nues Incites to sport which begins
as soon as school is out and lasts
until late In the evening.
The only dangerous feature of this
sport is that the declivity on either
avenue carries the children's sleds
to Main street at a rattling clip,
where a sharp turn is made down the
thoroughfare. Autoes are constantly
gliding up and down and several acci
dents have been narrowly averted.
Chief Evans warns the children to be
cautious and make as wide a turn
as possible at the corners and also
requests autoists to slow up at both
these corners and keep a watchful eye
out for the kiddles.
