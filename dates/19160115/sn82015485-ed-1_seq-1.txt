What' Good Does a Lost or
Stolen Check Book Do?
We bave just had an illustration of the value of
paying in checks your bills, as the robbers did not
take checks, they took only the money they found
io, the the safe.
Thus the merchants can give you creait on . your
account, wheras had you paid the cash, it would
of have irone and the record of who paid it not left.
Thus you- hc-lp yourself and the merchant by.
usinjr ycur check.

THE HIGH SCHOOL "BUNCH"
A tall changing: voiced lad, both awkward and green
A rosy checked lass, with some freckles I ween.
They worked through the grades and they now may be seen
Up among the smart freshies at high school.
He thought of his play, and she thought of her hair
And the- hadn't much time their work to prepare
And so the "old maids" marked them '"failing" and "lair"'
As is show n in the recoras of high school.
Hence those lacking in grit dropped out of the game.
3 ! And hunted for work, and when finding the same
1 j Soon earned for themselves a quite similiar name
j J To the one they had made w hile in high school.
i Is ut the '-pets'" whom the Profs permitted to pas.
5i L( Including, remember, our laddie and las..
li i With those who flanked, is the Sophoroere clas
efi ! The unknowable unit in high school.
y. j And our sturdy young man U no w in. rn. pants
y t Our freckled young maiden is learning to dance
B And both liave improved vcu can tell at a glai:e
H j If you look up their record- in high school.
? I They are '-on the ropes," They've been uurter tire.
A little bit green, but they hope to acquire
Such a speed as will pass them under the wire
In the race for the third year of high school.
The'v are good little kids, and make it their biz
To study for points: and they tackle each quiz
In a way that should send them through with a whiz
And thus make them brave Juniors at high school.
Our lad is a Junior A shadow of hope
Is seen where lie used his dad's razor and soap.
He swaggers a bit, as he talks of the dope
That he hands to his teachers in high school.
Miss Freckles hasJearned that the powder and pad
Will cover a blemish, if 'tisn't too bad,
So she spreads it on thick, then smiles on.the lad
As l.e carries her books up to high school.
They're trying to "spoon," (like the class in the lead)
Butthey both are too young to really succeed.
Theymight as well wait 'til! they're Seniors indeed.
And can do as they please in high school.
- The Seniors! The salt of the earth; and our pride.
They've learned how to dig, and they know how to slide,
, For they rode through w ith Caesar, a pony astride,
' - And thus made a grand show up at high school.
They study the Prof's, Avoid many asquall
So know when to use tact, and when to use gall.
They follow the scripture, "To all men be all"
And thus better their standing in high school.
A joke is a joke though a century old ,-r.
And a student is foolish rather than bold
Who refuses to laugh when it is retold .
As is shown in the records of high schools.
Our Seniors are wise, (and they're good looking too.)
They've taken no chances in being pulled through;
And if the two kids should eventually woo
There are others to follow in high school.
Here's success to the "Bunch.-' My story is told.
May Trego be rich in "Golden Belt" gold,
May pupils, and teachers together grow old
Out, and at work, in the Great World high school.

The Sale Blower Visits City
Last Monday morning between
three and four o'clock the safe in the
Trego Mercantile Store was blown
and sixty eight dollars taken.
Whether there was one or more par
ties concerned in the robbery of
course is not known. Who ever com
mitted the act made themselves
pretty well acquainted with the lay
of the land before undertaking it.
A brace was taken out of Harry
Reichard's shop and a bit out of E.
D. Beason's shop the party or parties
then went to the J. J. Keraus hard
ware store and broke in and stole the
powder for the job. i
The enterance to the Trego Store
was from the rear. The amount of
pcwder that was used caused a heavy
explosion which was heard by several
people who gave it no thought as be
ing connected with anything of that
nature. The door was blown com
pletely off and the safe badly
damaged inside. Mr. Ufford says it
is unusual that the store kept any
money in the safe but on Saturday
after banking hours be thought the
money would be safe until Monday
morning, but hereafter no risks of that
kind will be taken. A strange circum
stance in the-case is that there was
some money in the drawer at the J.
J. Keraus Hardware store and at the
Trego store which was untouched.
The whole matter looks as though it
was the work of a non-professional
and so far no clues have been traced.

On Tuesday the storm scheduled by

rather a strong wind from the north
fell at intervals during the day. The
wind continued all night and the

The people of Grainfleld very stren

Board of Health got after them about
the small pox quarantine last week
and say that the conditions were
greatly exaggerated. Wednesday's
Topeka State Journal contained a let
ter from Cat S. S. Reynolds signed
by a number of representative citizens
stating that the quarantine law had
not been violated and that there were
not a large number of cases of small
pox and. that to isolate the town
would be the rankest kind of an in-
i nstice. It seems a little hard to tell
just. where the trouble lies. . .

MARKET REPORT
Kansas City Stock Yards. Jan.ll, 1916.
Beef cattle trade averages steady
this week with the advance scored
last week. Receipts here have been
normal for the season, 14.000 yasterday -and
10,000 today. Buyers got a slight
advance today in the matter of bills,
due to a cold rain, but otherwise
prices w ere steady, exceptions strong- -er.
Some choice 1425 lb. steers brought
$8.75 today, highest price this month J
top yesterday $3.60. Nothing has
brought above $8.50 since the holidays
before this week. A number of sales
of beef steers were made at $7.90 to
$8 20, a string of 1500 lb. ninety day
rough Westerns selling at $7.90, con
sidered a strong price. Pretty good
at 7.50 to 7.75, and lighter steers
brought $7 to $7.40. It was a satis
factory market, with - more attention
paid to prime finish than in recent
days. Butcher cattle firm, havy cows
bringing $5.75 to $6.75, buils 95.25 to
$6.50, veals $8 to $10, heifers mostly
$6.25 to $3.50. Stockers and feeders
are strong, and anything good sells
quickly at a good price. Some white
faced Panhandle feeders brought $7.55
today, and plain panhandle feeders $7.
Stock steers sales this week range
largely from $6.25 to $7.25, with a few ;
yearlings $7.75. An immense distri-
bution of beef, as well as pork, is putt
ing considerable vigor into the general
cattle market.
Hogs sold a big ten higher, receipts
20,000 head. Packers were leaders in
competiton, reflecting a mammonth
business in cut meats and provisions
as there was a record supply at the
markets yesterday, Chicago 85,000,
St. Paul 44,000, and the other North
ern markets liberally supplied. Ex
ports of pork since the opening of the
winter packing season are more than
double those of the same period a year
ago, but lard exports sliow a decrease.
Again, the gain in stocks of all hog
product in December was thirty mil
lions pounds, gain in December pre
vious year 59 million pownds. Quality
of hogs coming here is excellent, and
order buyers assert Eastern killers
consider them worth 15 to 25 cents
per cwt; more hogs arriving at North
ern markets, due to better quality of
feed in Kansas City's territory.
Sheep sold 10 to 15 higher again
today, following similar advances re
gularly recently, receipts 7000, The
good lambs sold at $10.10 to $10.20,
heavy ewes $6.50, light yearlings $9.00
The market has a firm tone, and pro
spects favor still higher prices this
week. Of course, a heavy supply out
of Northern Colorado might tempor
arily upset the present schedule of
of prices. Feeding Iambs sell around
$8.75.
