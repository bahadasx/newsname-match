The Annual Banquet at the Appomattox Club was Trans
formed into a Regular Old-Time Republican Love Feast
ETH- WEIGHT WAS S1 SPEAKER OF THE
SeeTaG untimely and uneloquent re-
ggg sss B M0ST eminent MBs op ape-
HIS SUBJECT WAS "FIFTEEN YEARS OF THE APPOMATTOX CLUB "
SJl13 P HEBiro TO HIS TEXT HE SPENT MUCH TIME
rc.?3?? EANTING AGAINST THE ENEMIES AND TRAITORS
WITHIN THE RANKS OF THE APPOMATTOX CLUB, AND EIGHT
SS2L 2S THEN WITH HIS LAEGE LEGAL EYES BRIGHTLY
SHINING HE LOUDLY CALLED ON ITS ENEMIES AND TEAITOES
TO EESIGN FEOM THE CLUB. J.lxvx
ACCORDING TO THE WAY THAT THE BUND MAN SITTING HIGH UP
IN THE TREE FIGURED IT OUT THERE IS NO GREATER ENEMY
AND TRAITOR TO THE ETERNAL FITNESS OF THINGS THAN THE
HON. EDWARD H. WRIGHT.
S0N'..B'.F' M0SELEY SPOKE ON "LOYALTY AND HARMONY," AND
WHILE MUCH WAS SAID BY HIM ALONG THAT LINE, BUT COME
TO THINK OF IT THERE IS NOT ONE ABLE ATTORNEY BELONG
ING TO THE APPOMATTOX CLUB NO NOT ONE WHO WOULD
ABSOLUTELY REFUSE TO KICK IN AND CONDUCT A LAW SUIT
AGAINST ANY ONE OF ITS LAY OR COMMON MEMBERS PROVIDED
THEY WOULD RECEIVE A FAD2 SIZED FEE FOR THEIR LEGAL
SERVICES.
THE REV. HON. ARCHIBALD JAMES CAREY, PH. D. D. D., WHOM THEY
CLAIM AT ONE TIME JOINED THE APPOMATTOX CLUB, BUT
NEVER PAID ONE CENT IN DUES, IS FEEDING AT THE PUBLIC
CRIB AT THE EXPENSE OF ALL THE TAXPAYERS IN THIS CITY
AND COUNTY AND PRACTICALLY DOING NOTHING TO EARN THE
EASY MONEY WHICH HE WRAPS HIS TRICKING POLITICAL HANDS
AROUND EACH MONTH, WAS THE NEXT SPEAKER ON THE PRO
GRAM, BUT FOR SOME CAUSE OR OTHER HE FAILED TO SHOW UP.
HON. CHARLES SMITH, WHO CLAIMED TO BE THE MAYOR OF BERWYN,
WAS THE NEXT IN LINE FOR SOME TALKING AND AS HE IS A
TALKER FEOM AWAY BACK HE SURELY DID SOME TALKING.
HON. CHARLES C. HEALEY, CHIEF OF POLICE OF CHICAGO, SIDE
STEPPED THE REPUBLICAN MEETING OR BANQUET AND NOT
BEING PRESENT HE WAS ABLY AND BRILLIANTLY REPRESENTED
BY THE HON. OSCAR DE PRIEST, WHO CAME VERY NEAR CAUS
ING MANY OF THOSE SITTING UNDER THE SOUND OF HIS ELO
QUENT VOICE TO JUMP RIGHT SQUARE OUT OF THEIR' SEATS
WHEN HE DECLARED WITHOUT THE LEAST WARNING THAT
"RECENTLY HE CARRIED COL. JOHN R. MARSHALL, THE NEW
PRESIDENT OF THE CLUB DOWN TO THE CITY HALL AND HAD
HTM SWORN IN AS A SPECIAL OR EXTRA POLICEMAN."
THAT "HE IS NOW SERVING ON THE STAFF OF CHIEF HEALEY
THAT AS A MEMBER OF HIS STAFF HE WILL BE HIS PERSONAL
REPRESENTATIVE OR POLICEMAN AT THE APPOMATTOX CLUB
AT ALL TIMES," ALDERMAN DE PRIEST INTIMATED THAT IN THE
FUTURE THAT NO MORE ARRESTS OF ITS MEMBERS WELL BE
MADE THAT IF THE OFFICERS OF THE LAW ATTEMPT TO RUSH
INTO THE PARLORS OF THE CLUB AND ENDEAVOR TO YANK OUT
THOSE WHO MAY BE ENGAGED IN PLAYING CARDS THAT THEY
WILL BE ARRESTED BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE APPOMATTOX
CLUB, WHO WILL BE KNOWN FAR AND NEAR AS THE FIRST
PRESIDENT OF THAT FAMOUS CLUB TO BECOME AN ACTIVE
POLICEMAN IN ORDER TO PREVENT ITS UNFISTICATED MEM
BERS FROM FALLING INTO THE CLUTCHES OR THE HANDS OF THE
LAW.
HON. HARRY B. ATTT.T.Tra, PROSECUTING ATTORNEY OF CHICAGO, WHO
IS AT ALL TIMES THE OFFICIAL MOUTH PIECE OF MAYOR WIL
LIAM HALE THOMPSON, FOLLOWED THE HON. OSCAR DE PRIEST
AFTER PRAISING HIS CHIEF FOR APPOINTING SO MANY ABLE
COLORED MEN TO OFFICE IN THE PERSONS OF REV. A. J. CAREY,
HONS. LOUIS B. ANDERSON AND EDWARD H. WRIGHT.
HE PROCEEDED TO TELL HIS COLORED FELLOW CITIZENS THAT HE
DID NOT ENTERTAIN ANY RACE PREJUDICE AGAINST THEM
THAT ANY TIME THAT THEY GOT INTO ANY TROUBLE WITH HIS
END OF THE CITY LAW DEPARTMENT THAT THEY WOULD RE
CEIVE A SQUARE DEAL AND SO ON.
S. A. T. WATKINS, THE RETIRING PRESIDENT, STATED THAT THE
MEMBERSHIP OF THE CLUB WAS COMPOSED OF BOTH REPUB
LICANS AND DEMOCRATS, BUT ONLY DYED IN THE WOOL RE
PUBLICANS WERE PERMITTED TO RAISE THEIR VOICES ON THAT
FESTIVE OCCASION.
IT THEREFORE REMAINED FOR MR. WATKINS HIMSELF TO STATE
WHAT HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE PAST YEAR AS PRESIDENT
OF THE CLUB THAT FOR THIRTEEN YEARS HE WAS PROMI
NENTLY CONNECTED WITH THE LAW DEPARTMENT OF THE CITY
OF CHICAGO AND REPRESENTED ITS TWO AND A HALF MILLION
CITIZENS IN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AT WASH
INGTON, D. C.
The annual banquet at the Appomat
tox Club which was held in its par
lors last Saturday was attended by
about one hundred of its members out
f the two hundred and fifty-three
members and it was just as plain as
your noso on your face that long be
fore that evening it had been well
1'lanned to transform the affair into
a regular or a good old time Repub
lican lovo feastj as the list of 'speak
ers will bear out this assertion, for the
first speaker of the evening was the
Hon. Edward H. Wright, who seem
ingly has no use for two classes of
the members of the Appomattox Club,
they contend that he dislikes that class
of its members who never buy a big
stack of stud poker chips and he looks
down with scorn and contempt upon
that other class of its members who
refuse to bow down real low and
worship him as the Lord of Lords and
the King of Kings.
The Hon. gentleman who had the
nerve and the brass to proclaim him
self "one of the most eminent leaders
of the Afro-American race," was
called on to speak on "fifteen years of
the Appomattox Club," but instead
sticking to his text he spent most of
his time in bitterly ranting and spit
ting out fire and brimstone against
what he called or branded as the "ene
mies and traitors within the ranks of
the Appomattox Club and right there
and then with his large legal eyes
brightly sparking or shining he
called on its so-called enemies and
traitors to forthwith resign from the
club.
According to the way it looked to a
blind man sitting high up in the tree
there is no greater enemy and traitor
to the eternal fitness of things than
the Hon. Edward H. Wright.
It also appears to that same blind
man sitting high up in the tree that
it is that small number of the members
of the club who will persist in play
ing cards for money are doing more
lasting harm to the club than all the
other agencies combined.
Can you see this point the Hon. Ed
ward H. Wright? If so will you please
stand up and lead us in prayer!
Hon. B. P. Moseley who is one of
the big lawyers of Chicago and one
of the most eloquent orators in this
country was the next speaker "Loyalty
snd Harmony-" -was -his -subject --and
he said a great deal along that line
but some one has said and rightly too
that "there is not one able lawyer
belonging to the Appomattox Club who
would absolutely refuse to kick or
butt in and conduct a Jaw suit against
any one of its lay or common members
provided that they the lawyers would
receive a fair sized fee for their legal
services" so that knocks "Loyalty
and Harmony' ' into a cocked hat.
The Rev. Hon. Archibald James
Carey, Ph. D. D. D. whom they claim
that at one time joined the Appomat
tox 'Club but was never known to pay
one cent in dues or fees, who delights
to feed at the public crib at the expense
of all the taxpayers in this city and
county and practically doing nothing
to earn the easy money which he wraps
his tricky political hands around each
month who is known as the greatest
political pastor of the age who could
if he would tell an interesting story
in connection with his latest trip to
Milwaukee, Wis., some years ago, was
to succeed brother Moseley but for
some cause or other the distinguished
Rev. gentleman failed to show up.
Hon. Charles Smith who claims to tie
the Mayor of Berwyn was the next
speaker and as he is a fine talker from
away back he simply done some talk
ing. Hon. Charles C. Healey, Chief of Po
lice of Chicago, like his eminent friend
the Rev. Hon. Archibald James Carey,
Ph. D. D. D. side stepped the Repub
lican meeting or banquet, so he was
very ably and brilliantly represented
by the Hon. Oscar De Priest who came
very near causing those sitting under
the sound of his voice to jump right
square out of heir seats when he ex
claimed without the least warning that
"lately he carried Col. John R. Mar
shall the new president of the club
down to the city hall and had him
sworn in as an extra or special police
man; that he is now serving on Chief
Healey 's staff that he will be his per
sonal representative or policeman at
the club at all times." Alderman De
Priest strongly intimated that in the
future that no more arrests of its mem
bers would be made that if the offi
cers of the law attempt to rush or
brake into the parlors of the club and
endeavor to pull or yank out those who
may be engaged in playing cards that
they, the officers may or will be ar
rested by the president of the club
who will be known far and near as
the first president of that far famed
club to actively assume the duties of a
rough and tumble policeman in order
to prevent the unsophisticated members
of that famous club from falling into
the clutches or hands of the law.
Hon. Harry B. Miller the eminent pro-
X
y
i
secuting attorney of Chicago, who is at
all times the head official mouth-piece
of Mayor William Hale Thompson fol
lowed the Hon. Oscar De Priest and
after highly praising his chief for ap
pointing so many very able Colored
men to high positions in the persons
of the Rev. Hon. Archibald James
Carey, Ph. D. D. D.; Hons. Louis B.
Anderson and Edward H. Wright he
proceeded to tell his Colored fellow citi
zens that ho did not entertain one
particle of race prejudice against them
(who said hog wash!), that anytime
that they got or rushed into any
trouble with his end of the city law
department that they would receive a
square deal and so on.
To say the least his talk in that di
rection was entirely uncalled for, for
the Colored people have been taught
to believe "that all White Republic
ans are their true friends all Demo
crats are their natural foes and ene
mies." Hon. S. A. T. Watkins, during his
remarks stated that the member
ship of the club was composed of both
Republicans and Democrats but as the
'old saying goes ho was round over"
and only dyed in the wool Republicans
were permitted to raise their voices
on that festive occasion.
Therefore it remained for Mr. Wat
kins himself to recount or to state what
he had accomplished the past year as
president of the club that for thir
teen years ho was prominently con
nected with the law department of the
city of Chicago and represented its
two and half million citizens in the
United States Supreme Court at Wash
ington, D. C.
Our highly esteemed friend the Hon.
Henry S. Anderson, informed the
writer a short time ago that Dr. Ander
son accused F. Gillspe of using marked
cards at the time that they got or be
come mixed up with the one hundred
and fifty dollars.
Saturday evening, Jan. 22, the Ap
pomattox Club will give a smoker and
card party in honor of Bert Williams
and Prof. Just of the Howard Uni
versity, Washington, D. C.

KANSAS CITY SELECTED.
National Negro Business League to
Hold Seventeenth Annual Session
August 16, 1916.
After a most careful consideration
of the several invitations received
from different sections of the country
for the next meeting of the National
Negro Business League, we are author
ized by the members of the Executive
Committee to announce that the League
has decided to accept the invitation
extended by the Local Negro Business
League of Greater Kansas City. The
meeting will bo held August 16th, 17th
and 18th, 1916.
It appears that the Business League
has selected a most opportune time to
hold their meeting in Kansas City, for
as Mr. Fortune J. Weaver, President
of the Kansas City Local League says:
"These dates fit just right, as the
Masons will hold their Grand Lodge
in Kansas City during the second week
of August and the National Medical
Association comes during the fourth
week."
These two meetings in addition to
the Business League session, will offer
best possible inducements to the rail
roads to make special reduced fares
and will afford delegates to the Grand
Lodge and the Medical Association an
opportunity to attend some of the ses
sions of the Business League.
The Executive Committee has also
decided that it will be most appro
priate and fitting that the first night's
(August 16th) session be devoted to
Memorial exercises in honor of Dr.
Booker T. Washington, founder and
first President of the National Negro
Business League.
Further announcements regarding
the forthcoming meeting of the Nation
al Negro Business League will be made
from time to time through the press.
For further information write to J. C.
Napier, Chairman Executive Commit
tee, Nashville, Tennessee; Emmet J.
Scott, Secretary, Tuskegee Institute,
Alabama; Charles Banks, First Vice
President, Mound Bayou, Mississippi.

THE JOHNSON-FARMER EEOPE
MENT AND WEDDING AT WAU
KEGAN, ILLINOIS.
There is an old saying that wonders
will never cease and this being true
and the greatest wonder to many peo
ple in this city and St. Louis, Mo., is
how did it happen that Miss Lillian
Johnson and Attorney Walter M.
Farmer, who always appears as though
he is ready and waiting to be trans
ported right on to heaven, lately
sneaked away or eloped to Waukegan,
HI., by the light of the moon where
they lovingly joined hands for better
or worse and were pronounced hus
band and wife by one of the local
preachers of that city, thereby slyly
putting one over on their many friends.
Mr. and Mrs. Farmer, after enjoy
ing a brief honeymoon, are now at
home to their many friends at 4832
Langley Ave.
