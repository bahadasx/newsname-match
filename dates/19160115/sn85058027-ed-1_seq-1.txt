Tho decision of tho Provo Iloncli
justice who tried tho Thompson-Green
mule ense Is so unique that wo glvo
It In full, ns reported by tho Justice
to tho attorneys In tho case:
In tho case of Samuel Green, plain.
'Iff, vs. Hnrry Steele and Andrew
Thompson, defendants, I do, find thai
on direct testimony of the plaintiff he
testified that ho had taken no stent
to return the dead mule In contro
versy, but on tho other hand sought
to recover tho money ho paid without
returning the mule which died.
I further find that tho plaintiff tried
to doctor tho mttlo and to euro the
nmo, nn'd thus render less tho dam
ages which ho would suffer by rooson
of tho dlscaso of said mule, whereas, 1
hold that he should have lot the mule
died and thus been u total loss.
1 further find that tho plaintiff
should recover tho money ho lost, but
hat ho Is not entitled to the same
'intll ho has returned tho dead mulo to
defendants.
I concede that tho law would not
Tonulra tho plaintiff to return the
mulo, but I hold that law unjust nntl,
herofore, I shall ovcrrulo tho law
-I'd find for tho defendants, ns the
dead mulo has not been returned tc
them.

During tho year ending Dccembor

mortality. Sixteen of them were fe
males and eighteen wero males.
During this tlmo there wero ninety
eluht births recorded, flfty.flvo males
and forty-throe females. Taking these

Local Stockmen Dislike
Grazing Regulations

He Wasted Hccnuse of Lnto Entries.
Mr. J. V. Mnhwcll, tho forest ranger
In chnrge of this district, Was In
Pleasant .Grovo Tuesday receiving ap
plication for grazing on tho forest re
serve cast of this city. Practically
nil who grazed last year hove signed
up for tho same number of head again
this year, and about forty others who
lmo not grazed before linvo mode
applications Not all who hovo ntndo
application, will bo given permission,
tho rule being to nccommodnto tho
old grazers first, those feeding their
grazed stock on their own farms be
Ing particularly tho favored ones. Tha
government mnkes nn effort to nccom
modolo tho farmers first who llvn
close to tho ranges.
A now rulo to bo enforced this year
Is ono changing tho dnto on which tho
cattlo may bo permitted on tho rc
sorvo rrom May 1 to May" 16. This
rule has met 4ho almost unanimous
opposition of local slockmcn, who Pont
Joseph W. Thorno nnd Den Wnrnlck
to Ogdon to petition tho chlcr ranger
of tho Wasatch Forest Reserve, ask
ing that tho dates for entering tho
resorvo bo changed back again. Tha
head official, however, was In Wash
ington: The stockmon say that last
year they put up throo miles of fenc
ing nt a great expenso so that they
could grazo on the lower hills enrly
In tho sonson. They soy that the
lower hills nro, covered with olicat
grnss In lute April and early May. and
at this tlmo mnkes excellent feed. If,
however, tho cattlo arc not permitted
to" grazo until Mny lfi, then this grass
has become rlpo and absolutely value
less, nnd because of Its liability to,
catch flro It is very dangorous.
Tho forost rangors Boy that Home,
stockmen have abused the enrly grnz
lug period In tho past, and Instead
of grazing on the cheat grnss, they
