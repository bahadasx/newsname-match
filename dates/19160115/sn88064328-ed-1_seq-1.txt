sing, with the approval of i\ ,'S' it
sun, today dispatched to t .•>! balLuuu
at Queretaro for presentation to Gctje:al
Carranza a note denouncing the slaying
of Americans near Chihuahua by Mexi
can bandits and eating upon the head of
the de factor government for the im
mediate pursuit, capture and punishment
of tlie perpetrators of the deed.
The note urges the sending of troops
to other districts where Americans ar "
in danger of losing their lives or prop
erty.
At the same time the state depart-!
ment order an investigation of the mur- |
ders with a view of determining whether (
t' ey resulted from the failure of the de
government to give proper pro- 1
bandit outbreak
factor
tection in a zone known by it to be dan
gerous, or whether the men lost their
lives as the result of
T: '
which could not have been forseen.
Instructions to seek information on
this point were telegraphed to consu'ar
representatives in Mexico and along the
border.
Tn the note to General Carranza the
lulling of the Americans was described
as a distantly crime, committed in a ter
ritory announced to he in the control of
the C';irran/a was informed, because
t'.ry were Americans after tliev had gone
into th» country with the consent of the
Cjrr"?i.'a mi'ilary authorities.
Arrangements for bringing the bodies
of the slain turn to the TTnited States
were made early in the day. After sev
eral messages had been exchanged. Sec
tary I.insinir was advised from El Paso
that General Gavira and Consul Garcia
of the d" factor government had ar
ranged for a special funeral train.
Disnatches from El Pa-;o a'so said
that Carranza troops already were in in:r
stiit of the bandits. Genera! Gavira, it
v e stated, hnd sent soldiers to the south
from Juarez, while General Trevina was
said tn have sent another force west from
Chihuahua.

Just as we were beginning to
think that pacification was well
under way in Mexico the story
comes that Villa's bandits have
robbed and murdered seventeen
Americans. The United States
should take a hand in Mexico's
affairs-at least to the extent of
sending enough men into that
country to catch Villa and string
him up to the tallest telegraph
pole available.—Beaumont Enter
