OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
The high standing of the edu
cational system of this state is
shown in the report of the state
department of public instruction.
Of 511 high schoola, 153 are ac
credited 4-year institutions, 219
non-accredited schools, 8 3-year
schools, 18 2-year schools, and 4
1-year. English is the most pop
ular study, with a total enroll
ment of 30,308 out of 32,244 high
school students.
The republican newspapers here
abouts seem to have overlooked
the statement of Chairman Mur
dock of the progressive national
committee that there are at least
2,000,000 bull moosers who will
not swallow anything Penrose et
al may hand out via the republican
national convention; if compelled
to choose between Wilson and a
standpatter, he says 90 per cent
will vote for Wilson.
"The business interests which
usually look to the republican
party to give them what they
want, desire a high tariff —on dye
stuffs, for example—to protect
their prices in the home market,
subsidies for American shipping,
and a liberal immigration law, so
at the unskilled labor of Europe
may come to do our unskilled
tasks." This statement from the
World's Work is quoted because
it is authoritative diagnosis of the
republican party. The leaders of
this party frankly desire protec
tion for commodities and free
trade in men, high prices for con
sumers, low wages for working
men, more wealth at the top, and
less wealth at the bottom. The
party has drawn to itself the men
and interests who will profit by
such policies. It can learn new
wiles and new phrases, but it
would choke on new principles.
If the working men of the United
States are conscious of their own
interests the republican party will
never win another national elec
ion.—San Francisco Bulletin.
The county commissioners have
more or less trouble in handling
the question of care of indigents.
Many opportunities are presented
to them to care for people who
have close blood relatives living
in the community, and the atten
tion of the people, especially the
taxpayers, should be directed to
the sound provisions of the state
law, as follows:
Section 8375, Remington &
Ballinger's Code.
Every person who shall be un
able to earn a livelihood in conse
quence of bodily infirmity, idiocy,
lunacy, or other cause shall be
supported by the father, grand
father, mother grandmother, chil
dren, grandchildren, brothers or
sisters of such poor person, if
they or either of them be of suf
ficient ability; and every person
who shall fail or refuse to support
his or her father, grandfather,
mother, grandmother, child,
grandchild, sister or brother when
directed by the board of commis
sioners of the county where such
poor persons shall be found,
whether such relative reside in
the county or not, s.hall forfeit
and pay to the county, for the
use of the poor of their county,
the sum of thirty dollars per
month, to be recovered in the
name of the county commission
ers for the use of the poor as
aforesaid, before any justice of
the peace or any court having
jurisdiction, provided, that when
any person becomes a pauper
from intemperance or other bad
conduct, he shall not be entitled
to any support from any relative
except parent and child.
AT THE CAPITAL.
(By Congressman C. C. Dill.)
Take all the profit out of what
ever preparedness program is de
cided upon by providing that the
government shall build its own
ships and manufacture its own
munitions, v a growing sentiment
among members of both the house
and the senate. The report of the
Secretary of the Navy, Josephus
Daniels, has given additional rea
sons for such a provision in the
new army and navy bills.
"Experience has demonstrat
ed," he says, "that it has been
sound public policy for the gov
ernment to be able to manufac
ture smokeless powder. A few
years ago the government paid 80
cents a pound to the private com
pany from which it purchased its
supply." (The DuPont powder
trust.) "At the first session of
the sixty-third congress I recom
mended an appropriation to add
to the plant at the naval proving
ground, the appropriation to be
large enough to enable the navy
to manufacture all the powder for
its ordinary needs. This year the
product was nearly 4,000,000
pounds.
"Congress made the appropria
tion and the navy will soon be
manufacturing in its own plant
at Indian Head all the powder it
needs at a cost of 25 cents per
pound, instead of the 53 cents it
had been paying to private manu
facturers. The cost of manufac
turing in our own plant has stead
ily decreased. If the 3,984,978
pounds manufactured had been
purchased, it would have cost, at
53 cents per pound, $2,112,038.34.
Inasnnich as the actual cost to the
navy was 25 cents, the cost was
$990,244.50, or $1,115,793.84 less
than the price charged by the pri
vate manufacturers. This saving
is for one year only."
' The Secretary renews his recom
mendation for the government
armor plate factory to eliminate
the private profit graft from arm
or contracts. "It has been dem
onstrated beyond controversy,''
says Mr. Daniels, "that the prices
charged by the armor plate
plants have no reference to com
petition and little reference to the
cost of production. It is estimated
that if our government should es
tablish a plant with the capacity
of 10,000 tons, armor plate could
>c manufactured at $262.79 per
ton, or a factory with 20,000 tons
capacity at $230 per ton. The
price charged the government for
the last armor plate purchased
was $-435 per ton, and the price in
1913 was $154 on contract let
March 3, 1913, and $440 per ton
on contract let Nov. 17, 1913, and
in 1912, $420 per ton This .shows
that a very large saving can be
affected if the congress makes an
appropriation in accordance with
my recommendation for the erec
tion of an armor-plate plant."
This report is one of the strong
est official statements on the sub
ject yet issued, but it is never re
ferred to by the big army and
big navy men. To many of us
this indicates that they are more
concerned with the profits than
they are with getting a dollar's
worth of preparedness for a dol
lar instead of 60 or 70 cents worth
of preparedness for each dollar
appropriated, giving 30 or 40
cents of each dollar appropriated
to the armor and powder trusts.
BUY FLOUR MILLS.
Dale Jones and D. K. Zuck, who
have operated the Colville Fiour
Mills the pust year and a nidf,
last Saturduy purchased the prop
erty from J. C. Hean of Idaho,
The property is valued at $20,000,
and was built about nin.: jvuw
ago by the Lasswcll broth< is.
The building is 4% atori m high
and has undergone sonic interior
improvements since Jbofct und
Zuck have had the mill in charge
The new proprietors also added
$1,000 worth of new machinery,
and the mill is now one of the best
equipped and up-to-dat" M-nmng
mills in the northwest.
The name of the mill har been
Changed to the TopNoch i-lin.r
Mills, getting the name from the
TopNoch flour made at the mill*.
$1 Year in Advance; 5c Copy
I'sers of this brand of flour claim
it is the best they have ever used.
It is made with a mixture of hard
and soft wheat, and every sack
carries the guaranty of Jones
and Zuck.
The TopNoch mills also niami
fncture another first-class brand
of flour, made entirely from home
grown Blue Stem wheat. It is
called Good Flour and has been
very appropriately named, for
patrons of the mills who have
baked with it, invariably call for
Good Flour when laying in their
Hour supply. Every sack of Good
Flour carries a guaranty from
the mill proprietors. Colville
people are fortunate in having
two brands of high grade home
made flour to choose from, for if
one kind fails to plase, the other
one is sure to suit.
The TopN'och mills also manu
facture TopNoeh graham and
farina cereals, made from choice
Stevens county whent, and always
fresh ground on a French stone
burr. The mill also docs a large
business of feed grinding. The
high quality of the products of the
TopNoch mills is proof of the abil
ity of Mr. Jones and Mr. Zuck as
millers, each having had years of
experience in the work in other
states before locating in Colville.
The gentlemen formerly worked
together for four years in Cen
tral Oregon. The mill has a ca
pacity of 125 barrels per day and
has been working steady since the
new crop started Sept 1. Besides
other grains, there were 26,000
bushels of Stevens county wheat
brought to the mill this fall.
The volume of business done at
the mill the past year was double
that of the previous year. Messrs.
Jones and Zuck deserve the pa
tronage of all public-spirited citi
zens. Their products are first
class, and they have established a
cash market for all grains grown
by the fanners. Patronising home
industry is adding to home pros
perity.
This mill is a substantial benefit
to Stevens county. Farmers from
all over the county haul their
wheat and other grains to the
TopNoch mills and receive casli
for them. Before returning home
they go on a purchasing expedi
tion at the various stores, and
thus tin* money is kept at home.
In no better way can Stevens
county realize prosperity than by
patronizing home industries.
Through the efforts of Mr. Jones
and Mr. Zuek the farmers have
come to realize tin; benefit of rais
ing more grains, and last year
here was three times as much
acreage put to wheat as any other
year in the history of Stevens
county.
Judging from the conversations
with many of the leading farmer!
of the county, this year will wit
ness more and better fields of
graim in Stevens county than ever
before. The growing of grain as
an industry has steadily increased,
until now it is one of the chief
products of the farm. All over
the country more and mure
ground is being seeded to grain.
The Blue Stem and Marquis
wheat are the popular kinds in
Stevens county, both being recom
mended by the TopNoeb millers,
who also recommended the .Mar
ble variety of wheat, grown the
last ten years by Tlios. Graham
of Arden. It is thought that the
acreage of wheat in this county
will be twice that of last year.
THE ESSENTIAL FACTS
ABOUT AVOIDING "COLDS '.
The Washington state board of
health press bulletin says:
"We've all got bad colds at our
bouse" is the common expression.
The reason for the "we've all"
and "at our house" is because
colds are infectious. It is gen
erally conceded that colds are of
bacterial origin but we don't
know enough about cold bacteria
an yet to make a nerum treatment

We do know, however, certain
definite facts of considerable
practical value in preventing
colds. Here ate the essentials.
Colds frequently result where
there is a deformed or diseased
nose or throat or where there are
adenoids. Frequently the bac

with good DOSes and throats.
Living and sleeping in the fresh
air increases one's resistance
against colds. Taking a cold

helps immensely. Constipation is
very frequently an indirect cause
of colds and should be strenuously
guarded against. Over eating,
