Moro cows nnd less tobacco is right.
Somo few days ago tlicro appeared
in Tho Ledger a clipping from tho
Bracken Chronicle, stating what Mr.
Bach, who lives on tho J. D. McKlb
ben farm, had inado from fifteen cows,
nnd who ships his cream to Cincin
nati. Wo inquired nt our local creamery
as to about how good this averaco was
compared to some of our local farm
ers work. Wo wero shown several
very nice accounts, but wero unablo
to get in communication with tho par
ties for much detail, with on excep
tion, Mr. S. C. West of Springdaie, was
called and gavo us somo fow details
of his results in dairy business. Ho
explained that had been milking on an
averago of about fifteen cows, half
of which nro heifers in their first year
milking, and from this herd ho had
received from our Maysvillo cream
ery 9583.14 during Its first seven
months, May to December. Besides
this some cream had been shipped to
othor creameries from tlmo to tlmo.
Mr. West says ho also has twenty-ono
fine- calves valued at about ? 400 and
about $60 worth of hogs raised chief
ly on tho skimmed milk. Ho assured
us that ho was woll pleased with his
season's results and that ho oxpects to
milk moro cows noxt year, which wa
think speaks woll for tho dairying
business in Old Kentucky,
Mr. Dooley, tho creamory manager,
showed us tho checking account while
there had been moro than f 45,000 paid
out to farmers o ftlils section by the
local plant for cream and milk slnco
May 3.
Wo also found whllo noselng about
and asking questions that tho home
creamery Is paying 32 cents for but
ter fat this woek, tho same as Trl
State and somo of tho other Cincinnati
creameries, and wo aro unable to boo
why some farmers still ship their
cream away when old cream shippers
like Mr. West and many others have
beeu getting such Butlsfactory rosulta
In Maysvlllc
And we say again, moro cows and
less tobacco will pay just ns much
money.
