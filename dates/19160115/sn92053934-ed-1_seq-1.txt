BREAKS NEGOTIATIONS!
In Reply to Great Britain,
Berlin Ends Controversy
Rejects Proposal.
Berlin, Jan. 15, (by wireless to Say
vllle, X. Y.J In its reply to the Brit
ish government in the Baralong case,
the text of which was made public to
day, Germany takes the ground that
Great Britain no longer desires to ob-
' serve uie requirements 01 raieniaunu-
il law in regara to uerman suonia
rines and breaks off negotiations on
this subject. j
In addition to announcing its deci- j
sion to take measures of reprisal, as
made known yesterday, the German
government rejects Great Britain s
proposal for examination by a neutral
hoard of the Baralong incident and
also of three cases in which it is
charged Germany violated interna
tional law in submarine operations.
The note was delivered to Great
Britain through the American em
bassy. Reply of Germany.
The German government has made
the following reply in the Baralong
case:
"The British government answered
the German memorandum in the Bara
long case by expressing doubts on the
one hand, or the correctness of the
facts communicated by the German
government, and by making an accu
sation, on the other hand, charged.
German military and naval forces ol
having deliberately committed count
less crimes against international law
and humanity which had been unpun
ished and compared with the alleged
offense of the captain and crew of
the Baralong fades into insignificance.
The British government has contented
itself with mentioning without any evi
dence, three incidents in connection
with naval warfare in which the Ger
man officers are alleged to have com
mitted atrocities in violation of in
ternational law.
Protest Accusations.
"The British government proposed
in investigation of these cases by a
court composed of American naval
officers, and under this condition is
ready to submit the Baralong case to
the same court.
"The German government protests
most sharply against the unprecedent
ed and unprovoked accusations of the
British government toward the commander-in-chief
of the German arm
and navy and the imputation that the
German authorities have not dealt
with any such crimes as have come to
their attention. The German army and
of international law and humanity, and j
the higher authorities insist that in i
wv eveni onenses are committeo inev
shall be investigated asd punished
Bternly.
"The three cases mentioned by the
British government were investigated
thoroughly at the time by competent
German authorities.
"First, in the case of the Einking of
the Arabic by a German submarine,
the investigation showed that the sub
marine commander was forced from
circumstances to ram his craft. He
therefore believed himself to be acting
in Justifiable self defense when he at
tacked the ship.
The second case mentioned the at
tack of a German destroyer on a Brit
ish submarine occurred in this man
ner. A fight developed in those waters
between two warships, in which the
ubmarine defended itself by gun fire.
The British government can have lit
tle ground for advancing the charge

RUSSIANS ARE ON
NEW OFFENSIVE
Berlin, Jan. 15. The Russian offen
sive has been renewed on the Bess
arabian front and five important at
tacks have been repulsed by the Aus-tro-Hungarian
forces, according to
the Austrian official report, dated Jan.
14 and received today.
The Austrian official statement fol
lows: "On the BessariTjlan front the Rus
sians have again attempted to break
through near Toporoutz and east of
Rarinczlo. Five great attacks failed.
The well-directed Austro-Hungarian
artillery fire contributed to the re
pulse of the Russians. Since the be
ginning of the battle in East Galicia
and Bessarabia the Austro-Hungarian
forces of Generals Pflanzer, Baltin and
Bothmer have taken 5,100 Russians,
including 30 officers. Austro-Hungarian
patrols routed Russian field guards
near Karpilovka.
"On the Italian front several places
were shelled by Italian artillery. Ital
ian airmen have been active in the
Triest district. One bomb was drop
ped in Spirano, but caused no dam
age.
"In Montenegro the troops of that j
country, having abandoned their cap
ital, are in retreat on the whole south
and west fronts. The Austro-Hungar-
ian troops, who are following up the
enemy, have entered Montenegrin ter
ritory east of Bileoa and near Avtovac
and passed the line of Budua, Cettinje,
Grab and Grahovo. Xear Grahovoour
troons cantured three cannon with
their gunners, as well as 500 rifles, !

THE WAR TODAY
The eastern field of war attain
resumes prominence with the re
sumption of the offensive by the
Russians in Bessarabia. Vienna
reports that the Austrian lines
have been subjected again to de
termined attacks, but that the Rus
sian attempts to break through
were repulsed.
Austria claims that since the in
auguration of the winter opera
tions in eastern Galicia and Bes
sarabia more than 5,000 Kussians,
including 30 officers, have been
taken prisoner. The Kussians
claim notable (rains north of Czer
nowitz. The Austriuns refuse to
concede Kussian claims and de
clare their lines haTe held firm
at all states.
The Austrians announce further
advances In Montenegro. The
Montenegrins are In retreat and
are suffering losses in men and
guns, according to Vienna.
Germany, in replying to Great
Britain in the Baralong case, reit
erates the charges made against
the British auxiliary cruiser's offi
cers, accused in affidavits of
Americans on the steamer Micosian
of having refused quarter to mem
bers of a German submarine's
crew.
The German government de
clares unacceptable the British
offer to submit the Baralong case
to a tribunal of American naval
officers If Germany would submit
three specified cases of alleged
outrages committed by Gentians
on the seas to the same court.
Germany declares that In none
of the cases mentioned were tier

helpless persons.
In flew of the British refusal to
bring the accused officers of the
Baralong to trial. Germany will
adopt measures of reprisal corre
sponding with the provocation.

SUMMONS HIS BROTHER
Prince Henry of Prussia Is
Understood to Have Been
Called to Berlin.
Berlin, Jan. 15 (via wireless to Say
ville, N. Y.) Emperor William has
issued a public pronouncement re
questing the German nation to cele
brate his coming 5Sth birthday, Jan.
27, with only quiet thought and prayer.
Whoever wishes to give special ex
pression to his feelings is urged by
the emperor to do so in the form of
gifts, in order that wounds inflicted
by the war may be healed and in or
der that soldiers' families may be bet
ter cared for.
The emperor further says:
"It is still necessary that the heart,
thoughts and strength of the German
nation, both in the field and at home,
be directed to the one great aim of
gaining a decisive victory and winning
a peace which as far as the human
mind can conjecture, shall permanent
ly safeguard the country against a re
petition of hostile attacks."
Brother is Called.
London, Jan. 15. Prince Henry of
Prussia has been summoned to Berlin,
according to a Central News dispatch
from Berne. It is also announced,
says the dispatch, that Emperor Wil
liam's birthday festivities for Jan. 27
have been cancelled.
Prince Henry of Prussia is a broth
er of the German emperor, and the in-
ness of Emperor William. What ap
peared to be an authoritative state
ment that the emperor's illness was
not serious was contained in a Berlin
dispatch earlier in the week. A wire
less message from Berlin today said
the emperor had asked that his com
ing birthday be celebrated quietly.

ACTUALBLOGKADE

condition which had been established
by the orders in councils, was state

tives of American shippers whose bus
iness had been affected by the orders.
A person who has acted as a repre
sentative of American interests in
connection with British prize court
proceedings, reviewed today for the
Associated Press the evolution of the
orders in council.
"The British government shows an
unmistakable tendency now to shift
around to the persistently expressed
American contention that the interna
tional law which prevailed before the
present war must ultimately govern
Great Britain's assertion of her sea
power," he said.

While Interest Is Manifested
by Officials Dispatches
Not Fuly Believed. . -
COUNT DISBELIEVES IT
News of Notes With Plot
Connections Regarded
Skeptically.
Washington, Jan. 15. Press dis
patches from London telling of the
seizure of correspondence from Cap
tain Franz von Papen, recalled Ger
man military attache to the United
States, when he reached Falmouth,
England, and relating that it showed
that he had made frequent payments
to persons charged with responsibility
for blowing up American plants and
bridges in the United States, aroused
the deepest interest in official and
diplomatic circles here today.
The development came as a sequel to
the withdrawal of Captain von Papen
and his colleague. Captain Boy-ed, the
German naval attache, at the request
of the Washington government.
Doesn't Believe It.
I don't believe it," was the only
comment Count von Bernstorff, the
German ambassador would make con
cerning the dispatches. In German
diplomatic quarters the impression
was conveyed that it was thought pos
sible Captain von Papen had been con
nected with the published documents
of British agents. It was argued as
incredible that von Papen with the
knowledge that his ship would be tak
en into a British port to be searched,
would have carried any such corres
pondence as mentioned in the dis
patches, even if he possessed it
Only Salary Paid.
At the German embassy it was said
that the ambassador had paid consid
erable money to von Papen as salary
and for the expense of such work as he
was expected to conduct as military
attache. Embassy officials had no
knowledge of his private bank account
or of how he disbursed the money.
Administration officials declined to
comment on the dispatches pending the
receipt of copies of the correspond
ence, which has been turned over to
the American embassy In London for
transmission to the state department
Jfot Regarded Material.
It was made clear at the German
embassy today that Captain von Papen
was in no way responsible to Count
von Bernstorff for his expenditures. It
was freely admitted that the with
drawn military attache had been given
money, some times because of his Ina
bility to draw funds for himself from
Berlin. He was not responsible to
the embassy for his expenditures.
Embassy officials seemed inclined to
regard the matter as not being serious.
They consider that as von Papen was
withdrawn for his military activities,
the question is at an end and the pub
lication of evidence which might or
might not show what those activities
consisted of is of little importance.
As for the alleged payment of $700
to Wener Horn, it was said at the em
bassy that the money might have been
spent in counsel fees. Embassy of
ficials were much interested In the
question of whether the check stub
was dated before or after the explos
ion which blew up the Canadian Pa
cific railway bridge at St. Croix, Maine.
Secretary Lansing allowed it to be-
! come known today that the state de-
ipartment would not consider the con
! tents of the documents until official
: copies had been received from Ambas
sador Page t London.
