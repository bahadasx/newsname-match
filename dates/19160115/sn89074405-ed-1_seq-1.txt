In this connection, the
answer says:
"The German government takes the
position that the charges against
members of the German forces must
be investigated by Its own competent
authorities, and that the persons ac
cused be given every surety of an un
prejudiced verdict with just punish
ment where necessary."
Established By Affidavit.
Continuing, the German reply con
cluded as follows:
"In the Baralong case the German
government has advanced to the Brit
ish government no request other than
this, not doubting for a moment that
a court martial composed of British
naval officers would inflict suitable
punishment for the cdwardly and per
fidious murder. This request was the
more justifiable because of the fact
that the guilt of the commander and
crew of the Baralong was established
practically beyond doubt by affidavits
made by Americans, who are neutral
witnesses, and submitted to the Brit
ish government. The manner in
which the British government has an
swered the German memorandum,
does not correspond In form and con
tents with "the gravity of the situation,
and makes K'niipossibifc for the 'Ger
man government to negotiate further
with the British government in regard
to this matter.
"Inasmuch as the British govern
ment has declined to make amends
for this outrageous incident, the Ger
man government feels itself compell
ed to take Into its own hands the pun
ishment for this unatoned crime, and
to adopt measures of reprisal corre
sponding with the provocation."

LITTLE EMOTION
Clenching of Fist Only Indi
cation That He Was
Disturbed.
Minneapolis, Minn., Jan. 16.—
Frederick T. Price was' today found
guilty of the murder of his third wife,
Mary Fridley Price. Without display
ing the least emotion -ther than a
nervous clinching of his' hand. Price
at 12:40 p. m., heard the deputy dis
trict court clerk, read thf verdict.
The jury had been' out a little more
than 19 hours, but members said to
day that there was at no%lme danger
of a disagreement.
County Attorney John M. Rees
would not say positively whether or
not Etehlson will be brought to trial.
When Deputy Sheriff Louis Malchow
went to the jail to take Price to the
courtroom, Price asked eagerly:
"Have they agreed?"
When told they had reached an
agreement he said:
"I am glad of it. I know that I
am acquitted."
.A written copy of the verdict was
handed to the clerk.
The expression on Price's face did
not change as he heard the word
"Guilty." He was absolutely im
mobile except for the clinching and
unclinching of his right hand.
In his cell just after he had been
taken back Price repeated over and
over again: "Guilty, guilty,, guilty.
They call that justice. I am innocent
and the world will learn it."
Fifty feet away from Price, in the
detention ward of the county jail, C.
D. Etchison, whose story convicted
Price, heard of the verdict. Etchison
showed no elation.
"Guilty, that is justice," he said.
The case was given to the Jury late
yesterday afternoon at the close of a
trial covering nearly two weeks.
Under the law, the penalty for first
degree murder Is life imprisonment.
M. C. Brady, chief counsel for de
fense, is prepared to make application
for a new trial on the. ground that
evidence favorable to the defendant
had been"discovered the clos
ing arguments This evi
dence, he declared, wotfla knock out
the testimony of Charles D. Etchison,
chief witness for the state, who swore
that Price murdered his wife for her
fortune by throwing her from a cliff,
and striking her on the head with a
rock. Etchison also testified Price
paid him a goodly sum of money for
his silence.

Today, the Increased passenger

railroads operating west of Chicago to

In going from East Grand Forks to

made in the present rates, making It
desirable to buy tickets in that city
for any who intend going to a Minne
sota point. In going from East Grand
Forks to Duluth, however, the ad
vanced rate is in effect, as both roads
running from here to Duluth, i»«
through a small part of Wisconsin in
making the trip, and puts the rate
under the interstate act.

is not affected by the change.

BIG SUMS WERE
EXPENDED BY HIM
British Seized Documents
and Turned Them Over
to United States.
Washington, Jan. 15.—When Count
Von Bernstorff, the German ambassa
dor, was shown London dispatches
last night telling- of the correspond
ence and accounts taken from Cap
tain Von Papen, the former German
military attache here, his comment
was:
"I don't believe it."
Further than that the ambassador
declined to be quoted for publication.
He did make it plain, however, that
he doubted that any documents of an
incriminating nature had been taken
from Captain Von Papcn.
Germans Skeptical.
The impression which was conveyed
t.o questioners by officials in German
diplomatic circles was that they
thought it possible that Captain Von
Papen had been connected with the
published documents by British
agents. Their argument was that it
was increditable that Von Papen,
knowing that his whip would be taken
into a British port to be searched,
would have carried any correspond
ence of such a nature, if he pos
sessed It.
At the embassy last night it was
stated that the ambassador from
time to time had paid much money
to Captain Von Papen in the way of
salary and for the expenses of such
work us he was expected to conduct
as a military attache. The embassy,
it was said, had no knowledge of his
private hank account or of how he
disbursed the money.
Deny Payment.
Embassy officials specifically dis
claimed any knowledge of the re
ported payment of $700 to Werner
Horn, connected with the attempted
destruction of a Canadian Pacific
bridge. They further disclaimed ac
knowledge of the explosion referred
to as having occurred in Seattle, or of
Kuepferle, the Brooklyn man who
several months ago was caught with
an American passport and while on.
trial as a spy^committed suicide In
the ToWer of London.
The development aroused the deep
est interest everywhere in official
Washington.
London, Jan. 16.—Copies of corre
spondence seized from Captain Franz
Van Papen, recalled German military
attache at Washington, when he
reached Falmouth on his way to Ger
many, have been turned over to the
American embassy for transmission to
the state department.
They shaw that Captain Von Papen
made frequent payments to persons
charged with the responsibility for
blowing up munitions works and
bridges in the United States.
The entry shows that Captain Von
Papen gave $700 to Werner Horn,
who was arrested in connection with
blowing up the Canadian Pacific rail
way bridge at St. Croix. Me. The day
before this check was issued the Ger
man embassy paid $2,000 in Captain
Von Papen's account.
Captain Von Papen's check stubs,
bank books and letters from his bank,
the Rlggs National bank at Washing
ton, show about 500 Items, many of
which had to do with routine expendi
tures. Others, however, revealed pay
ments to various persons who have
figured prominently in the activities of
German agents in America and to at
least one spy, who committed suicide
in a cell in an English prison.
large Payments.
Several large payments were made
to Captain Von Papen by Count Von
Bernstorff, German ambassador at
Washington. Most of these were for
salaries or bonuses. A number of en
tries showed payments made by the
ambassador to the military attaches
for "war intelligence office." One of
the payments on this account, made In
October of 1914. was for $2,300.
Another check stub shows that
about two weeks before the explosion
in Seattle on May 30, 1915, Captain
Von Papen sent $600 to the German
consulate at Seattle. In February of
1916 he sent $1,300 to the German
consulate in that city.
Suspicious Checks.
In January, 1916, he gave a check,
payable to Amslck & Co.. New York,
but with the name E. Kuepferle In
brackets on the stub. This is believed
to have references to the man named
Kuepferle. who, after being arrested
in England on the charge of espion
age, committed suicide, leaving a writ
ten confession in his ceil.
As an example of the size of the
captain's financial operations, his
bank book shows that in January of
1916 he received approximately $6,600
and paid out $6,000.
Roasts the l\ S.
Among the papers taken from Cap
tain Von Papen was a letter from the
German consul at New Orleans, con
doling with him on his recall from
Washington and criticising severely
the attitude of the American govern
ment.

established by orders in council. The.
statement is made by Americans who

fore that even veiled or sub rosa rec
