Several officers were lowered into the steel hull of the E-2 but
were pulled out unconscious, though they took all available methods
for securing a supply of fresh air. --

Eidso
Battery
Repr
n
v ofVork and High Hopes of Navy
Though the military order barring newspapermen from the New York
yard makes it Impossible to learn the details of the explosion today, it is
known that experiments have been in progress on the E-2 for some time
with the new Edison batteries. (
Last December'. 4 the Star-Bulletin printed the news that the Edison
-battery was being installed on the E-2 and that Edison had asked, the gov
ernment to withhold Judgment until the actual worth of the batteries had.
been proved by use on this craft. The Edison battery is designed to free
the submarine? from the dangerous chlorine gas. It Is also a smaller and
lighter battery ; than those now in use and its greater capacity was ex
pected to increase the possible cruising radius of the submersibles.
In view of the disaster to the F-4 and the theories concerning battery
explosion, etc., during the months of her salvage and later, the experi
ments on the Edison battery have been watched witli greater interest not
only among navy men hefe hut by Honolulu generally.
Edison's labors on the famous battery included the handling of 55,000
experiments and an expense of $3,000,000, and date back to 1910, when offi
cers of the U, S. navy were ordered to investigate submarines and told '
their troubles with batteries to the noted inventor.
Battery Placed In E2 Only After I
Exhaustive Tests Indicated Safety
Last fall a representative of Edison
gave the first account of the experi
ments with the new submarine, which
are of particular interest now. In
June, 1914, Edison decided that he
had remedied the flaws in hlsTttven
tlon and entered a test of cells in
which many manufacturers were par
ticipating. This test was carried out
on a special platform In New York
navy yard. When the announcement
was made last fall, it was declared
that the Edison battery had been
charged and discharged 500 times, rep
resenting 10 years off active service
on a submarine. i
The following statement relating
directly to the Installing of the Edi
son battery on the F-4, was then
made: :"
"The Navy Department gave us an

Navy men here have been follow
ing the experiments with much hope
and , expressed themselves as believ

improvement ' . .
The Star-Bulletin communicated the
news of the E-2 disaster to Admiral
Boush at Pearl Harbor this morning.
Admiral Boush expressed his deep re
gret at the occurrence and said that
all would hope, the disaster Is not as
fatal to life as early reports would in-.
