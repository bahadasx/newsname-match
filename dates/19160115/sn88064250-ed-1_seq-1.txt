VICTORY POINTS TO
DARIUS M. FONTENOT
INDICATIONS POINT TO AN OVER WHELMING MAJORITY FOR
THE "CREOLE PONY" IN THE RACE FOR
SHERIFF OF ST. LANDRY
That Darius M. Fontenot will' be
elected sheriff of St. Landry is a
foregone conclusi on of
all disinterested parties.
Even supporters of the opposition
feel that Mr. Fontenot is a sure
winner, unless the tide is changed.
Indications point to a Fontenot
landslide in St. Landry on January
25th. Reports from all over the
parish indicate that Fontenot will
carry five wards in the parish and
will fare well in the other ward,

THE WOMAN'S CLUB
The first meeting of the Opelou
sas Woman's Club was with Miss
Belle. Dupre, Saturday afternoon,
Jan. 8th.
That thepeople of Opelousas may
know the object of this organiza
tion, we deem it fitting to tell
briefly some of the things the club
hopes to accomplish, that is, with
the assistance of the good people of
Opelousas. The object and pur
pose of the "club is the literary and
civic advancement of not only its
few members but of the town and
its people.
As most of the readers. of these
columns klready know, the main
civic advancement for which we
are striving at present, is scouring
of a Carnegie Library. This club of
small membership does not "hope to
accomplish anything too massive,
by itself; but with the help of all
the progressve men, women and
children, it hopes,. in the near fu
ture to secure a library, which will
redound to the credit of Opelousas.
And now with reference to the
literary feature of the club. For
the year just beginning we have
taken up the study of American
literature and the first twelve meet
ings will be devoted to. the poets.
For each meeting there is a differ
ent leader. The first• meeting, at
Miss Dupre's, dealt with the poet
William Cullen Bryant, with Mrs.
Will Stewart as leader. In the Qr
der of our meetings the leader has
a prepared paper and then a
round table discussion follows by
the members. Mrs. Stewar t after
having read her paper called on
Mrs. Robert to read one of Bryant's
short poems entitled ".Summer
Wind:'." Mrs. Jordon read another of
his short poems. entitled '"To A
Mosquito," after which the round
table discussion followed which
lasted from 30 to 40 minutes. The
club then adjourned to meet at the
home of Mrs. E. K. Eastham.
TEXANS PURCHASE KING MOR
GAN
Proof that St. Landy parish is
still an important center for fine
blooded stock is seen in the recent
sale of the thorough bred stallion
King Morgan by Dr. J. A. Iffaas to
Messrs. Monsees and Yznaga of
Brownsville ,Texas. These parties
are extensive ranchers in that sec
tion and purchased King Morgan to
place him at the head of their drove
of brood mares. They were in Ope
lousas recently with two carloads
of mares and were much impressed
with the adaptibility of this sec
tion to stock raising.

Is Easily the Winner 'at
Saturday's Contest
The Opelousas girls basket -ball
team defeated the St. Martinville
tearh on last Saturday by the over
whelming score of 99 to 22. The
local. girls virtually played "ring
around, roses" with the visitors and
Streated them shamefully in the
way of scores.
After the game the visitors were
treated royally. by the Opelousas
girls, a dance being given in the
dining hall of the LaCombe Hotel,
which was very much enjoyed by
the fair damsels from St. Martin
ville.
The Opelousas team has been
playing sensational ball this season,
being defeated but once 'and that
time by the Batoni Rouge team,
which had previously lieen unmer
cifully swamped by the Opelousas
team; the Baton Rouge girls de
feated Opelousas, ;.due to .the fact
that the meinbers of the local team
were fatigued after. riding on the
early morning Frisco train.
An interesting game of basket
ball will take place' at. Washington,
this afternoon. Opelousas - and
Washington contesting for the hon
ors of the parish, the Opelousas
girls as the favorites.

All the pupils of the High Schonl

square at nine o'clock, Tuesday
morning to show the voters how
many children would be deprived
of an. education if the school tax
would not be passed. The children
tmarched around the square sing
ing Dixie, America and other patri
otic songs and a song "Camping on
the Court House Square," which
aws composed for the occasion.
Each class had a banner with some
appropriate motto on it such as,
"Vive l'Education," "Be Square,"

TAX ISCARRIED BY
OVERWHELMING VOTE
PROGRESSIVE CITIZENS OF OPELOUSAS CARRY THE DAY FOR
THE SCHOOLS OF THE OPELOUSAS
SCHOOL ON TUESDAY
The progressive citizens of Ope
lousas evinced considerable" interest
in the maintenance tax 'election,
on Tuesday, and consequently
easily secured the passage of this
splendid and important measure,
the tax beig adopted by an over
whelming majority. The votes were
310 for and 59 against, and $611,600
for and $362,590 against.
The opponents of the tax felt so
positive that they had the day won,
when early on Tuesday morning,
they were several thousand dollars.
ahead, but the lady members of the
tax campaign committee got busy
and in a few minutes the tax advo
caters were in the lead by over one
hundred thousand dollars in valua
tion.
The feature o f the election day
was the parade by the school chil
dren, over five hundred marching
around the court house square a
while after the polls were open,
singing "We Want Your Vote." The
parade made a striking impression
on the taxpayers, several,, who had
come to- vote against the mesaure,
being persuaded to change their!
minds, while a few went away with-j
out voting, rather than cast their
lot against the children of Opelou
sas School District.
The fact that the tax carried by
such. an overwhelming. majorityI
shows that the people of Opelousas
are up-to-the-mrinute and as pro
gressive- as citizens ' of 'all other"
cities, which faced the same condi
tion of affairs., There was such a-1
rush ,all morning Tuesday, that the
commissioners were not given time '
to breathe, the record of the vote
to the minute being kept up until.
almost noon.
A large number of country peo
pie, in fact the great majority of
the taxpayers residing outside ithe
city limits, came into town on Tues
day, and contrary to the expecta
tion. of those who have been against i
improvement tafation,- cast their
ballot in favor of the school, thus
showing that the rural districts are
as anxious to secure good schools
as are the towns:'
When the fight for the mainte
nance tax was 'first-started a large
number of" taxp'ayers thought that
the tax was defeated before it was
OPELOUSASS MAY GET BAR AS
i SOCIATION IN MAY
Judge Gilbert L. Dupre and Mr.
E. B. Dubuisson are in receipt of a
letter from t'he Secretary of the
Louisiana Bar Association, stating l
that the City of Opelousas had been
suggested to the Executive Commit
tee of the Louisiana Bar Associa
tion as a desirable place to hold
the annual meeting of the Associa
tion next May.
Judge Dupre has replied stating l
that our people -would be delighted
to have the Association meet here. 1
That Opelousas knew how to en
tertain such a crowd as would at
tend. That we cannot only accom
modate all who come, but give 1
them a royal welcome. All our
people desire, is timely notice,
when they would do the rest.
We hope the Association will se- i
lect Opelousas as the place of its
next meeting, when if it does, our
Speople will see to it that the mem
bers attending, will have a royal
good' time.
JUDGE DUPRE IN EUNI.C
SJudge Gilbert L. IDupre of Ope
.iousas, was in Eunice Wednesday
afternoon and Thursday morning,
Sshaking hands with many friends
-and reminding them of his candi
dacy for the Legislature. The Judge
stated to a reporter of this paper
She expected to be nominated in the
first primary, but was taking no
chances; moreover, said the Judge,
"I like to come to Eunice and me,
my old friends who have always
been so kind to me. Some of them

submitted. The tax campaign com
mittee was organized and the ladies
of Opelousas taking a leading part
in the campaign, it was not many
days before the city and surround
ing country were being systemati
cally worked in behalf of the tax,
with the results on Tuesday which
astounded the most optimistic of
the tax advocators. the measure be
ing carried by a majority of 151
votes and one quarter million dol
lars in valuation.
The Clarion' was the first to take
up the fight for the maintenance
tax, each week it urged. the taxpay
ers of Opelousas and surrounding
country not to turn a deaf ear to.
the appeals of the children of Ope
lousas School District. It was the
only newspaper in this city which
took up the cause of the children of
Opelousas, the only one which was
bold enough in the face of strong
opposition to urge taxation for edu
cation, at a time-when taxes 'sound
as bad - to . property: owners as
Heaven does to Satan. We believe
that we fought for a righteous
cause and we would believe it even
though the tax would have been de
feated. Unless we make. provision
for the education of our future
citizens this city is certainly doom
ed to perdition..
After the results of the election
were made known the five hundred
pupils of the Opelousas High Sochool,
'who ,had stood about the court
[house al' day, cheered loudly
thanking the voters and finally go
ing home contented that they had
Iwon the day.
The result of the election will
greatly redound to the credit of
Opelousas; many Louisiana town$
were waiting to see the result saim
ply to judge of the caliber, of tbe
Opelousas property owners.
The taxpayers of the city, and
surrounding country, the teachers
and pupils of the Opel 'usas :school
and the tax campaign committee,
as well as every ,;.dividtil whYor
w.rie.d in behalf of thiv lax "'-.1
to be highly ietnal~lrj r.,r ioi.ig
that which will permanently plaae'
Opelousas among the progressive
cities of Opelousas. They have,
won a splendid battle.
