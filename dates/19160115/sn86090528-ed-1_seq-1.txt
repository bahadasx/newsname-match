JACOB GOOD DROWNS WHIM TO SAVE BOY
r1
)
SEIZED WITH
AND SINKS
ICY WATERS OF LAKE
Heads Party of Sunday School Boys for
Outing; Teis Lad Breaks Through
Ice; Teacher Goes to Rescue;
Pulmoter is Applied
J. C. Good president of the Grady
County Fuir association, one of the
largest farmers and breeders of thor
oughbred stock in Southern Oklahoma
and one of the best known and most
universally beloved citizens of Grady
county.wag drowned at 12:'.iO this after
noon In what it, known as the Brown
lake, two miles oast of Chickasha.
Good lost his life in saving that
of a boy companion who bad broken
through tha Ice while Bkating.
It has been the habit for a long time
past for Mr. Good to lake the boys of
the Sunday school ciias which he
leaches in the Chickasha Presbyterian
class for an outing on any SatuiJay
when he can get away from bis busi
ness. This morning he headed a party
of a half dozen or more of those ladts
taking them in his auto to the lake on
the tarm of J. L. Drown.
The boys had spent the greater part
of the morning, report says, in hunt
ing and skating on the lake. Just be
fore tne games of the morning were
ca'b d off for a noontime luncU. Ken
n. th 'leis, son of Rev. Kdward n. Teis,
of the First PreiibyterHn church, Is
t;iid to have skated or approached in
some manner an air hole, or a place
where the Ice, which had grown rot
ten and spongy, was too brittle. The
boy crashed through the Into the
freelnir water. Qnlck as thought, it
is said ty those who were present.
Mr. Good threw off hia coat and kicked
off his shoes and dived Into the water
artcr the boy. The boy was reamed,
whether through the efforts of Mr.
Good or. whether through his own ex
ertions, none seemed to know this
ufternoon ,as all those who composed
the party were demoralized by fright.
At ary rate, after the Teis boy had
reached the shore Mr. Goode's error's
to gain a hold on the crumbling ice
were unavailing. As xist as he would
pet a hold and attempt to draw his
Jjody from the water the ice would
crush away with him and precipitate
1dm back Into the lake. The boys and
others who -had rushed to the rescue
h pan breaking the Ice from the shore
outward In order that the drowning
man might bo saved and for a time it
looked as though their efforts would
meet with success. However, the chili
waif n brought on an attack of cramps
and Mr. Good sank beneath the surface
of the water, drifted beneath the ice
crust and rose no more.
Mrs. J. Ci Brown, having become
alarmed by the commotion on the lake
thore and by the cries of the parties
about the lake, upon ascertaining the
trouble phoned the poltrr-ffcpartment
of C'nickaha and the sheriff's ofHcc
The office of the Good Real Estate
company was Immediately notified and
C. Schlotterbeck and Richard Caveit
hastened at once to the scene of the
"tragedy, accompanied by G. F. Newell
and Drs. Emanuel, Antle and Leeds.
The fire department, armed with grap
i,line hooks, repaired to the lake. With
these hooks a rescuing party compos
ed of Messrs. Newell, Schlotterueck.
Cavstt and a member of the fire de
pnrtmtnt procured a boat and began
a systematic search for the body. The
Ice was broken ahead ar.d the bottom

Hst the efforts of the rescuers met
with success when the grappling hook
held by Mr. Newell caught in the cloth
ing of Mr. Good. Willing hands drew
the body into the boat when It was
drawn to the surface and as It was
brought to the shore the doctors
gathered and began a futile effort to
restore life. A pulmoter was brought
Into reouisiition and for over an hour
everything known to medical science
and skill was done in order that the.
expired spark of life might be again
fanned into a mortal existance.
hcn the news of fatality reached
Chickasha, shortly before 1 o'clock
this afternoon, everyone was shocked
beyond expression. Parents of the boys
who composed the outing party were
frantic until they learned of the safety

IS HELD FOR GRAND
JURY BY HAMILTON
Confined in Chickasha Jail Till Monday
Pending Efforis to Furnish $500
Bond; Bill Boosting is Bit of
Bunglesome Work
According to the evidence brought
onh at his hearing yesterday after
noon before United States Commis
livonor Eugene Hamilton, A. H. Gibbs,
who claims to reside 5 miles south
east of Alex, imagined he could give
Uncle Samuel's government card$ and
spades and big and little casino and
four acej jnd all the photograph cards
in the matter of making money.
Gibbs must have been, in former
years, a race track follower. At any
rate he played 'em straight and for
their places and made It a ten to one
shot each time. He did this, it is al
i'-'ged, by raising a modest one dollar
bill to a ten dollar William. Aud
the winner came in a length nhead un
der the w!re until Gibbs placed a bet
wish Columbus Sansing, a, chvk in a
store over about Ales.
After Gibbs had bought a dime's
worth of "keen spittin' tobacco" from
Sansing and paid him with a ten spot
which had been raised from one and
received $9.90 change, took the Vinegar
Valley limited for Lindsay aul Sang
f i'E found out he had been stung.
Sangsing immediately called up Deputy
Jim Dillon of the United States mar
shal's office, and sang-sung to him his
tale of wee.
Tt was then that the beginning of
the end began for Gibbs. When Deputy
Dillon received Sangsing's message it
was too late for him to catch the Lind
say Independent, to he caused tin
w ires to s;i,g with a message to Deputy
Garland cf the sheriff's office cf '"ir
Yin county end the deputy took Gibbs
under his w'ng and brought him over
to Chickasha and delivered turn to
Deputy Dillon who in turn had hin.
locked in the county jail of Gradj
county, pending his hearing before
Commissioner Hamilton.
At the hearing yesterday afternoor.
at 5 o'clock, Judge Hamilton decided
that Cibbs should be held to the fed
eral grand jury in the sum of $500
The commissioner ordered Gibbs com
mitted to the jail at Muskogee, but the
order permits him to be held in the
Chickasha jail until Monday pending
an effort upon his part to make the re
quired bond.
A. H. 1ibbs, the defendant, claims
to hail from somewhere or other in
Texas. He has, he says, been making
his home with a brother-in-law. Bill
Wilson, who resides near Alex. De
fendant denied having intentionally
passrd a raised bill on Sangsing. II?
said he received the bill from Cash
ier Wasson of the bank at Alex. Cash
ier Wesson appeared before the com
missioner and told a different story.
Gibbs then btated he had changed a
ten dollar bill for a stranger on the
train between Alex and Lindsay and
said he might have received the bill
from him.
The raised bill is in possession of
the federal authorities. It is a very
crude affair and the work of raising
has been done in a most bunglesome
manner.
