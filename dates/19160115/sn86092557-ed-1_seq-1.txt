(By Associated Press.)
NEW YORK, Jan. 15?The United States submarine
E 2 was today blown up and partially sunk in the New
York Navy Yards. The body of one man killed in
-the internal explosion was recovered and a report to the
Brooklyn police headquarters said 7 others were killed.
The cauee.of the explosion which was s^id to have open
ed iup several plates of the craft could not be learned some
i^tune after the accident occurred. Several rescue parties
|wKich undertook to enter the submarine were driven' back
by heavy gas fumes." Several officers who were lowered
?"lntothe craft were pulled out after becoming unconscious.
The one body recovered was found near a hatchway,
i Newspaper men were barred from the yards and. it was
withmuch difficulty' that -the reports of the explosion
f could be confirmed through yard officials and all details
^concerning the accident were refused.
It was reported that'the engineers in the navy yard
jwere testing one of the new batteries installed in the craft
at* the time of the explosion.
These batteries were intended to obviate the .danger to
ihe^crews.:from gas-fumes: Recently submarines of the 3
Slaks were^reported to have made successful trips with the
lj|ftt^ries.iniuse'- "? - - ---

The submarine E-2 was built in 1901
ad displaced 430 tons. She was cap
able of traveling. 14 knots on the sur-'
face and 11 knots when submerged. - ;
In "September, 1914, had: a
narrow escape from accident slmillar
to : that which befell the F-4 outalde
^Honolulu harbor. ?
While the submerglble was engaged
In. manuevers-Ensign George Glllam
'detected chloric gas when the vessel
?gn^submerged'50 "feet.
jKjHe ran' to the'surfa6e by using the
pump lnsteadVof blowing up the tank.
When the submarine reached the aur
Mace the conning .tower: was- quickly
opened to give'the crew^ fresh-air.
Everyone o'f'ihe-ii} members of .the
' crew, It is said, were more "or less af
fected by the. gas, some bleeding from
StHej nose and mouth
ffi8?As.a. result of the accident, Ensign
Glllam was under medical treatment
in- the naval hospital In. Las Animas,
jCal.Kfor several months.
The E-2 was the ;only vessel in the
world equipped with Edison jiicket bat
terles and Bhe.made her-first trip suc
cessfully with them on December 7,

.-With Lieutenant Charles M. Cooke,

tensive trip,on the surface, then div
ed and maneuvered for several hours.
-/.After these experiences tho E-2
irnde/a successful run submerged and
- the crew found no trace of gas.
?Sji'The run proved, it was declared on
excellent authority, that the new bat
teries gave the best Bpeed with less
tuel. -
The E-2 went Into commission at
^Boston in the spring of 1912. The boat

SHORT TERM IMPOSED UPON A
MAN ARRESTEDilN
FAIRMONT
Incarceration In prison (or one hour
was the sentence Imposed on Gabriel
Kerry, who waJ arrested in Fairmont,
several months ago on a charge of
forging a post office money order for
a small amount, according to a mes
sage reaching Fairmont today from
Gary, Ind., where the trial was held
in a Federal court.
Attorney Ernest Bell rejyeeented
Kerry before United States commis
sioner Lilly at Grafton where Kerry
was taken for a preliminary examina
tion. Kerry's arrest was the result of
a number of suits and cross suits grow
ing out of tho sale in Marion county
of real estate in the vicinity of De
troit, Mich., and In Canada across the
line from Detroit.
Upon the advice of Atorney Bell,
Kerry acknowledged to having vio
lated the law regarding the money or
der but the evidence showed that on
account of his ignorance of the Amer
ican language he affixed another man's
signature to the order at the request
of a person who tol<|. him that he Was
doing what was right.

Delicate Operation Almost a
Commonplace at Cook
. - .. . * -..-A
Hospital.
Three Caesarian operations in a po
riod of one month is the recent record
for Cook Hospital and in a period of
four months, six operations have been
performed. * In Itself this would be'
quite remarkable in a city the siz"
of Fairmont, but the record for th(
first year really;is out of the ordinary.
Some fifteen or twenty of these deli
cate and comparatively rare opera
tions were performril. in that time
Mrs. L. C. Gray of Barnes streot,
this city, underwent the Caesarian op
eration at Cook hospital Thursday of
this week, making the third similar
operation in a perod of one mdnth.
Mrs. Gray is considered to be quite ill,
but Is expected to recover. The infant
whose birth was premature owing to
Complications of the case lived only a1
short time.
On December 14, Mrs! J. -E. Huffman
of Hoult, underwent a similar opera
tion from which she recovered nicely.
On Thursday January 6 . a toe 9%
pound son was born to Judge and Mrs.
W. S. Meredith at the hospital by the
Caesarian method. Mrs. Meredith and
son are doing nicely and will soonj
leave the hospital. . ??
One case is reported where a woman
residing in the Westv came to Fair

from a two days' trip to Pittsburgh
more enthusiastic than over regard
| ing the construction or bridges.across
the Monongahela river and Coal Run
such as will be a credit to a progres
sive industrial city like Fairmont.
Conferences with Francis R. Shunk,
of the United States War Department,
regarding the construction of a bridge
across the Monongahela river resUlted
in a clear understanding as to Just
what steps must b# taken by the city
to facilitate a speedy granting of the
desired permission.

river at its Junction with the

bridges across deep ravines in the

In other parts of the city.
But the bridge which pleased them
most Is the splendid concrete struc.
ture with a span 'of 300.4 feet which
carries Larimer avenue over the dee?
ravine traversed by William Pitt
boulevard, Pittsburgh's famous auto
mobile speedway.
This bridge contains the longest
