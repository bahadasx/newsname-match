The State of Kentucky is going far
enough when it provides free schools
for children. Anothor sot of schools
for adult illiterates would be an ex
pensive experiment for a state deeply
in debt. Solve the problem by letting
the illiterates attend the regular
schools.

ILL ONLY
f SEVEN DAYS
Pneumonia Causes Death of
Victim One Week After
Attack.
, Emsley Crabtree died at his home
about four miles from the city, on the
Greenville road, Thursday, after an
illness of only a week of pneumonia.
He was a bachelor and was 60 years
old." Mr. Crabtree was a native of
this couniy and was a son of the late
Wilburn Crabtree. He had resided
in this county nearly all his life and
lived in this city for a while about
two years ago. ' The interment took
place at Aritioch yesterday.
The. Latest Mexican Outrage
Washington cannot act too energet
ically in the cas&of the murder or six
tnon Americans near Chihauhau City.
That bandits and murderers are able to
engineer and consummate an outrage
of this enormity in tho heart of a pop
ulous Slate is disastrous to any hope
wo may havo had that something like
order lmd returned to Mexico
It mipht be hasty to conclude from
any isolated incident that conditions in
mw prt nr ns baa as over, uuitw
taihly thore is no ground here for be
lieving that "the situation" in that
onMtnTv if? "comnosinu itself" in a
gratifying manner.
' It-is nearly 'impossible for Wash
ington and tho public alike to acquu e
an accurate concepti&n of the extent
of Garranza's control of affairs in his
1 troublous country. Tho continued re
Aurr'enco of such outrages as this gives
MPrcssivo testimony of what yet re
inafns to be dona So long as such nn
affair as that at Chihauhua is possiblo,
control is open to most
. energetic questioning. That is a con-
M.tt... that the Government at
" Wnkhinaton must face squarely in as
timating the degree of success or its
Mexican policy in the past, and in de
1 termining itscourse in the immediate
future.
Hs inconceivable that the State Do
' iSrtment should omit to press the tie
facto Government to the point of giv
ing satisfaction if there can bo satis
faction for such a crime or of con
vMna it of tho inability to doso.

soldier in northern Mexico weuld be
pressed into service, if necessary, to
achieve this purpose.
In a statomont later Mr. Arrendondo
declared that the men who lost their
lives had attempted to reach their
places of business before complete
control of the region had been ac
complished by the Carranza forces.
He said they had been given permis"
sion at their own request to pass
through the Carranza lines, although
Americans had been warned to keep
out of territory in which guerilla war

Rev. Burke Culpepper, the noted
evangelist, of Memphis, Tenn., will
hold a revival meeting in Cadiz next
September.
When Mr. Culpepper was engaged
in a recent meeting at the Tabernacle
in Hopkinsvillc, he was approached
about coming to Cadiz by some of our
people. He expressed a willingness
to come, and after a conference of
some of our citizens representing the
three churches of the town, the evan
gelist was written to about the matter.
On last Sunday afternoon a meet
ing was held at the Christian church,
a good representation from all three
churches of the town being present
After some discussion, the meeting
selected an executive committee com
posing of John S. Crenshaw, presi
dent, of the Christian church; Judge
W. H. Hooks, secretary, of the Bap
tist church, and John J. Jefferson,
treasurer, of the Methodist church.
The sentiment seems to m unani
mous among the church people of the
town favorable to hi J Cuming.
There are sevfefal factory buildings
in Cadiz that in be secured for the
meeting, hit it lack of proper ventila

Despondency Over His Business
Affairs The Supposed
Cause.
Ed J. Duncan shot himself in the
left breast at oleven o'clock yester

lishment in Hotel Latham. Partios in

and going into his store, found Mr.
Duncan staggering about in a small
dressing room in the roar, -with a
pistol lying on a table noar by. He
was bleeding from a-wound near his
heart.
Physicians were hastily summonod
and an examination showed that the
heart had been missed by the ball
and that the -wound might not prove
fatal.
To Rev. J. B. hshman who came
in and asked if tho shot was acciden
tal he said no. Asked why he did it,
he said he didn't know, adding "I
am not going to die." Tho pistol be
longed to his son-in-law, Ed Jones,
who was at his house. After tho
. ....
tracedy occurred - his daughter re
called that her husband's pistol hud
been missing since morning.
The pistol was .i 33 S. & W.. The
ball went around his body and con
tinuing its course passed through tho
thick part of a door to a side room.
Mr. Duncan was taken tojthe Hospit
al yesterday aftornoqn and prospects
aro good for his recovery.

Tho long predicted cold wave came

degrees. It was preceded by hard
rains Tuesday and Wednesday.

than the usual amount of suffering,
being in such striking contrast to the
mild veather that has so far charac
terized the winter.

degrees below zero was recorded.

Another Step Toward!. Makings:.
Adriatic an AustriamSea;
Blow to Italy:.
London, Jan. 24. Another' deci
sive stage in the Balkan situation has
been reached, with Montenegro' now
following Serbia in virtual absorption
by the invading forces. It waslearncd
last night that Austria and Montenegro
had come to an armistice, this 'being
construed as the last act of the little
country, after having its capiiul, Cet
tinje, dominated by the Austrians'
capture of Mount Lovcen.
Italy had so much at stake that offi
cials and diplomats had been waiting
anxiously for the sfeps Italy would
take to relieve Montenegro atid at the
same time avert another extension on
the Adriatic. They wore aware that.
Italy had once before prevented Aus-
tria from gaining territorial conces
sions from Montenegro near Cattaro
by emphatically objecting.tothe treaty
made in 1912. As Italy was then a
member of the triple alliance-Austria
reluctantly yielded to the Italian, ob
jection.
The news of the entente allies1 oc
cupation of Corfu is said to have ex
cited the greatest fndignation. in Ger
many, where the fact that-Achilleion
castle is to be used as -the Serbian
headquarters is regarded as a perso
nal insult to the German emperor. It
is said that the emperor has sent a
a personal protest to the king of the
Greeks, holding Greece responsible
for any damage to Gormair property.
An Amsterdam dispatch to the Ex
change Telegram company says: "The
German emperor is still abed suffer
ing from his throat and a fever has
set in."
