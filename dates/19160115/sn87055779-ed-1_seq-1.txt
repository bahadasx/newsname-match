Rumors Are Current That Ne

Another Confession Vin
dicating Woman.
COURT SESSIONS TO BE
RESUMED ON MONDAY
Sensation is Promised For
Next Week Honors Aft
er First Week of
Trial Are Even.
International New Service:
PROVIDENCE, R. I., Jan. 15.
Mrs. Elizabeth Frances Möhr may
be vindicated before the celebrated
murder case 13 given into the hands
of the jury.
More or less vague rumors are
current that the negro chauffeur,
George Healis, would make still an
other confession.
This, it wa.s said by friends of
Mrs. Möhr, would exonerate her of
the accusation that she hired Healis
and the two negroes on trial with
her, Cecil Victor Rrown and Henry
Spellman ,to murder her husband.
Dr. C. Franklin Möhr, and injure
Miss Emily Rurger.
There was no session of the trial
today, adjournment being taken
until Monday.
Wanted Attorney.
The story was that one night this
week, Healis, In the local jail, sent
for George C. Lewis, attorney for
t.rown. Iewls was in Roston. Other
defense attorneys went to see Healis,
but he demanded Lewis. The negro
lawyer was said to have seen him
later.
Those who were supposed to know
about it declined to talk, but it was
understood that Healis wanted to re
pudiate his previous conflicting
ctatements. withdraw his plea of
nolle contendre and assume all the
blame for killing, that he attempted
to rob the doctor and was forced to
shoot him and Miss Rurger because
they resisted.
All of the followers of the trial
today were buzzing with Lhe story
and it was expected that new week
would bring some sort of a t-ensa-tlon.
Honors Arc Iacii.
The first week of the trial ended
with honors about even, both sides
claiming advantages. Th? state was
elated that it had succeeded in get
ting the alleged Rrown and Spell
man admissions before the jury Mrs.
Mohr was delighted because the
court had told the jury three times
and had said he would finally charge
them what happened when Mrs.
Mohr was confronted by Irovn in
Chief O'Xelll's otllce should not be
considered to retlect against her.
On Monday the state will put on
Capt. Monihan and Inspector Ahearn
to corroborate previous testimony
about the "confessions."
A remarkable actor in the sombre
drama is Mrs. Elizabeth O'Keefe,
the court's stenographer. In Rhode
Island each court has only one
stenographer. She has no relief and
takes the entire procedlngs, aver
aging 30,000 words a day. She
transcribes her notes after adjourn
ment and her memory is such that
she often sets right the court and
the lawyers when they are in doubt
about a bit of testimony, without the
trouble of going back over her notes.

EL PAS. Texas. Jan. 15.
Though the Cirranza government
has inaugurated a policy f exter
mination -against the followers
Francisco Villa and has already put
to death more than ".. persons, w
eluding Gen. Jose Rodriguez, as ;t
result of the massacre of a party of
Americans in western Chihuahua,
efforts were redoubled to-lay to in
sist to th." border every Amerira i
and British subject now in north ru
Mexico.
Representatives of the RritMi
government have ordered the ob
jects of Great Rritain out of the in
terior of Mexico in the belie; that
no foreigners will be spared in th
vengeance which the Villista faction
has threatened to take.
An In Groat Danger.
As the Americans and Britons in
northern Mexico number more- tb.fi
2.000 men, women and children, it
is feared that it will be se ral
weeks before all are re-svued. Tiio
fugitives will be in reat langer i:i
their fiiglit to the border, as at k- -eral
points they will have to p.i-s
through districts in whi h Villa .
his followers are supreme.
The situation at Pat ral caused in
tense anxiety here today. In that
Mexican town there are 125 Amer
icans. As leports reachtd here u .
Gen. Villa and a large force of
Mexicans were marching on th'?
town with the intention of destroy
ing it and killing the foreigner
there a special train was st nt from
Juarez with the object' f rescuing
the imperiled Americans.
Carranza troops were also rushed
toward Parral, but they were met
and defeated by the Villistas at
Escalon. This will endanger th
rescue train as the Villa soldiers
will be able to attack it -n its way
to the border.
Want No Assistance.
Carranza officials in El Paso and
Juarez toIay reiterated their as
sertion that the troops of the "f.rst
chief" would 1 anle to le.il '
the situation and refused t con
sider proposals that American
troops cross the border fr tempo

iK-spite their confident assertions,

that Villa's forces had won further
