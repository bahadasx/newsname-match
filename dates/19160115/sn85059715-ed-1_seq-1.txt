LONDON, Jan. is?rne damage
caused by the flood In northern Holland
is said by Reuter's Amsterdam
correspondent to be greater than was
believed at first. The great dike
along the Zulder Zee collapsed at
Mveral places. Peasants with their
cattle fled nreclptately before the
rising waters.
Near IJuiden the dike broke several
points before the people realized
the danger. The waters of the Zulder
Zee rushed through the gaps
wlt^i such force as to wash away
large sections of the road which
runs along the dike.
From all north Holland come reports
of distress caused by the flood.
Considerable damage was done at
Volendam and Kdnm, in Texel and1
Marken Island, and in the province
or Groningen.

(By (icorge \\. Iiudderar, secretary,
of the hoard of trade.)
The possibilities or industrial, com- i
merclal and civic development of this
community through an organization
like the Clarasburg Board of Trade is
or might become by more active support
of Clarksburg's citizens, are almost
unlimited. This organization
has the support of a goodly number
or citizens, has an able board or directors
guiding its operations and work- '
lag through the medium of a reasonably
Industrious secretary has acconinllshprt
some real thlngR during the
last two years, and for the year 1916
hopes to see a greator awakening on
the part of our men and women for
the continued growth of the city's Institution.
Did you ever hear of the communl-;
ty spirit? It has taken the people
of the United State a long tlmo to
find out that we are no longer rtimlUes
hut urhanites, and now that we
are learning the tact tnai over .or.y
per cent of us arc community
dwellers we are beginning
to sit up and take
notice of our surroundings. When
most of our people lived In the country,
we raised our own food, drew
our own water, protected ourselves
from fires, thieves, tramps, etc. But;
when we began to group ourselves In
towns and cities we soon became more
independent and we are just beginning
to learn to co-operate and secure
for one another all those things
at a reasonably proportionate cost.
A "community spirit" Is developing
In all progressing cities. We are ap;
predating more than ever before In
: the history of this countp* that we
oifre something more to the com;
munlty In which wo live than merely
paying taxes and keeping out of jail.
Wo owe the debt of citizenship.
There has been a great civic awakening
In many communities, and It,
I Is inspiring a new patronlsm, which
for want of a better name we will
call "civic pride," and our people are
beginning to learn the great leBson,
that the community In which we
live Is exactly what we, Its Individual
units make It, or permit it to be.
If we remain Independent and give
no heed to our fellow individuals, or
to the common welfare of all,xthen ;
our community Is not living up to j
Its opportunities. But If we as citl-:

summoned to Berlin In connection
with tbe illness of Emperor William.,
What appeared to be an authoritative,
announcement that the emperor's 111-'

i Berlin despatch earlier in the week.'
A wireless message from Berlin tolay

whoever wished to give a special ex-|

do so by gifts for the care of the

In framing my response thereto. To

an honor of which' an American cltl- .

to seok such an office by a large re- .^sj

and duty. Frankly, my lucllnat
