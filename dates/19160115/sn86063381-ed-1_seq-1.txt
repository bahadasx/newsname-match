games

THE BEMIDJI
A
QUAY'S ODDEST STORY
^ines, la., Jan. 15.
The rfy of Iowa, now 69
years of age, has begun to
plan the celebration of its
Diamond Jubilee, Dec. 28,
1921. Citizens here and else
where are preparing petitions
to the legislature to recog
nize the movement and fix
th* date for the jubilation
over the 75th anniversary of
Miss Hawkeye's marriage to
U. S. A.
POLITICIANS IN
ST. PAUL DISCUSS
STANTON CANDIDACY
Bemidji District Judge Silent
Democratic Gubernatorial
Mention.
on
LEADERS DIVIDED SAY
WILL AND WILL NOT RUN
May Enter With Understanding of
Getting National
Appointment.
St. Paul, Minn Jan 15 Al
though C. W. Stanton, district judge
at Bemidji, Minn., told the United
Press he would not at present make
a statement regarding his having
been mentioned as democratic can
didate for governor, politicians here
today were busily discussing his
case. Although these politicians
suffered themselves to be inter
viewed, they declined to permit their
names being used These politic
ians were divided into two distinct
factions, the respective leaders of
which told the United Press:
May Get Consulate.
"He will run."
"He will not run."
The former argued that any at
traction that might draw Stanton
into the race might not entirely be
what he would gain at St. Paul.
Some openly intimated that he
might consent to run, with the un
derstanding that he would get a
Democratic appointment at Wash
ington, or some similar job, either
at the expiration of the term as
governor, if elected, or at the end of
the campaign if he were not elected.
Has Good Office.
Those taking the negative side of
the question point to Stanton's
present apparently pleasant sur
roundings at Bemidji. He has a
good job for six years, gets $4,500
a year, it is said, and his living ex
penses in Bemidji are reputed to be
not at all what they would be in
St Paul. These men argue that
Stanton would not consider making
a change. It wouldn't pay, finan
cially, they say. In the same breath
these men argue that Stanton is not
the kind of a fellow to be attracted
by the glory of the office.
153 EAT LUNCHES

tance from purchasing lunches, one

Central school.

BAUDETTE WANTS TO BE
ON JEFFERSON HI6HWAY
Baudette, Minn., Jan. 14.It is
considered probable here that Bau
dette will be included in the route
of the Jefferson highway, which will
extend from New Orleans to Winni
peg. The route has been designated
as far as Bemidji, and beyond the
county seat it will be selected by
G. W. Cooley, state highway engi
neer.
The Beltrami board of county
commissioners has recommended
that the highway after leaving Be
midji should follow ditches and
roads to Clementson, where it would"
connect with rural highway 32 to
Warroad. From there it would go
to Roseau and then to Winnipeg.
A place on this big auto and wagon
highway would be a splendid thing
for Baudette, in the opinion of vil
lage officials, as thousands of tour
ists will travel it every year. Black
duck and Kelliher residents are in
teresting themselves and Baudette
will unite with them to boost for
the highway to come this way.

"TRULY HUMAN DOCUMENT"
Zurich, Jan. 6.(By mail.)
What was termed by Swiss
officials "truly a human
document," was "bared" by
secret service agents in the
arrest of a woman, an alleged
Austrian spy, whose back
was covered with indelible
writing military secrets.
The Swiss agents are also re
ported to have arrested an
other woman with a "broken
arm." The cast, removed,
revealed a perfectly good
arm bandaged with military
documents.

Minneapolis Man is Convicted for
Murdering His Wife May Get
New Trial.
STAY OF SENTENCE IS
GRANTED UNTIL WEDNESDAY
Verdict Carries Automatically Sen
tence to Stillwater Prison for
Life.
Minneapolis, Minn., Jan. 15.
Frederick Price was found guilty
this afternoon for the murder of his
wife after the jury had been out for
18 hours and 40 minutes. The ver
dict was returned at 12:45 o'clock.
Trembles Violently.
When the verdict was given Price
trembled violently and broke down
for the first time since the trial be
gan.
He said that a few indiscreet ac
tions on his part influenced the jury
against him.
For New Trial.
"I don't know about a new trial,"
said Price. "I will consult my at
torneys. I don't understand Etchi
son's story. I am unable to under
stand the verdict."
The verdict carried with it auto
matically the sentence of life im
prisonment in the state penitentiary
at Stillwater.
Stay Granted.
Attorney Brady for the defense
moved for a stay of sentence until
Wednesday. This was granted.
Seven years ago, Price, a traveling
man, visited Fridley, a little Minne
sota village and met Mary Fridley.
They were married in October, 1908.
On Thanksgiving day, 1914, records
show that Mrs. Price's father gave
her $10,000. Three days later, Nov.
28, 1914, Price, his wife and Charles
Etchison, a friend, attended a mat
inee. At Price's suggestion, the
three went for a drive along the
cliffs overlooking the Mississippi
river.
L^ Z2Rir fi
When on a rocky ledge 40 feet
high, Price stopped the machine,
claiming engine trouble, and sug
gested that Mrs. Price and her dog
go for a walk up the road while he
worked on the engine, according to
Etchison's signed confession. An
hour later Mrs. Price was picked up
at the foot of the cliff. Price sued
the park commissioner for damages,
but dropped the suit when they
threatened counter charges of never
having secured a legal divorce from
Rose Smith Price, whom Price mar
ried at Wheaton, 111., in 1896.
Price's Story.
Price's story as given on the wit
ness stand is as follows:
Price, Atchison and Mrs. Price
were riding on the East River road
for an outing when the auto engine
failed to work properly.
Price stopped the auto at the wid
est place in the road to fix the en
gine.
Price suggested that while he and
Etchison worked, Mrs. Price take the
dog for a walk
She acted on his suggestion.
As Price and Etchison worked they
suddenly heard Mrs. Price say, "Oh,
Fred."
They walked to the bank, looked
for her and failed to find her.
They looked down on the river
level, 40 feet below, and saw an ob
ject they could hardly make out.
They hurried down the patch and
found Mrs. Price unconscious and
bleeding.
Price remained with her until Et
chison got passing autoists to help
carry Mrs. Price to the top of the
cliff.
Price held his wife in his arms
until she reached the hospital, where
she died.
Etchison's Story.
Etchison's story as given on the
witness stand is as follows:
Mrs. Price's automobile with Price
and Etchison in the front seat and
Mrs. Price and her pet dog, "Chum,"
in the rear, was driven by Price to
a point selected on the east river
bank weeks before.
At Price's suggestion that she walk
around and exercise "Chum," Mrs.
Price stepped backward out of the
auto.
Price stood on one side of the auto
door and Etchison on the other.
As Mrs. Price placed one foot on
the ground, Price grasped her around
the waist, catching Etchison's arm
at the same time, and dragged both
to the edge of the river bank.
At the brink Price released Etchi
son's arm.
Then Price with great effort hurl
ed his wife backward over the cliff
onto the rocks 40 feet below.
Both men ran down the river bank
along a sloping path and found Mrs.
