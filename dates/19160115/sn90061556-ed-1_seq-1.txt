LEISURE HOUR REFLECTIONS
FROM A QUIET CORNER.
By Dennis Thompson.
Work is the ko;noto to permanent
success, and few successes can bo at
tributed to persons of untrained tal
ents, and yet, hero .and there may be
found one, -who has como up through
the storms of disadvantages, and have
been set upon the pedestal .of fame
along with the chosen few.
Nature has endowed the average in
dividual with talent; some are fortun
ate enough to have received several",
but whatever the gift with which you
have ben endowed by Nature, it may,
iu course of time, prove of little or no
value unlesssbacked up by hard work.
Sometimes you may be able to bring
out the "unsuspected" talent in your
self through hard work, and the great
pity Is that so many of us abhor the
idea of hard work, but the person who
loves to work sometimes uncovers en
dowments in their own nature that
they little dreamed of. Then, this
should be one of the good excuses for
hard" work; we can never tell what wo
may bo able to turn up by constantly
digging. So many people are afraid of
being busy, and are forever worried
about being tired, when engaged at
something worth while; but on the
other hand, it they are doing things
that are of no credit to them, they can
spend a lot of time at It without a mur
mur. We should at all times bear in
mind the Importance of employing our
time to the best advantage, which, if
we do, we are not so apt to neglect the
improvement of such talents os we
may bo endowed with. The person
who' labors to improve that which they
have, cannot help but make a success
of life, while those who are not train
ing what talent they have, but are
looking for more, are bound to prove
a dismal failure. The great aim in
life should be a steady growth in the
things that make for the advancement
of Christianity, the progress of the
world, and the uplift of humanity, gen
erally. When al lis summed up, we
find that the answer is work hard
work.
There is so much to bo said about
work that our minds should not be
satisfied with the impression left by
hard work. Then, again, there are so
many times people grasp the wrong
Idea of how work should be done. The
work that counts for success in this
world is hard work, well done; a lit
tle while ago the world was praising
us for hard work, but now, one gets
credit for hard work well done, and
this is the class of work most sought
for. Ofttimes we meet with persons
who have a great deal of work on hand
because they have conceived in their
minds the greatness of having interest
in a large number of things. This is
a thing that cannot be recommended
from the fact that a' person cannot bo
engaged at too many occupations and
bo successful. It is far better that
we concentrate our powers on one
thing, doing that well, than to have
so much to do and not do halt our
worlc. One thing well done Is more
creditable to us than a dozen half
done. These are things which should
be looked after as wo go through life.
oD the little things right around us;
do them well and when the time is
ripe, greater things may seek us. The
main point Is to know that we can do
it a little better than someone else.
It is a matter of grave concern that
as we go about from day to day to
meet with so many people who stand
high in the estimation of the world,
who are dishonest from choice. If all
parents would teach their children
that to be successful, one must be
graeter than their work and that price
cannot buy character, that they will
always be rich as long as they retain
it; in proportion to their strength, and
integrity, and weak and unhappy and a
failure, no mater how much money
they may have, Just in proportion to
the weakness of character, If they only
started out with the conviction that
but one real failure is possible, and
that the loss of self-respect, the bar
ter of character, either for pleasure or
money; if children were taught that
they cannot aford to deceive even, a
litie bit in the quality of service, they
give In working and dealing with peo
ple what a great change would come to
our civilization!
Dishonesty should have no part in
our lives, It is tho duty of everyone
to be honest. The sphere of duty is
Infinite and exists In every station of
life; we have it not la our choice to
be rich or poor, to be happy or unhap
py; but, it becomes us to do tho duty
that everywhere surrounds us. Obe
dience to duty, at all costs, is the very
essence of the highest civilized life.
Great deds must be worked for, hoped
for and died for, now, as in tho past.
The old story of the conductor admon
ishing tho new brakeman to keep his
lantern by his side, Instead of hanging
up In one corner ot a car, at the other
end of tho train, looms up before us
each day. There are so many people
of ability that nro neded in the great
batle ot llfo each day. to help give
counsel, and point out the smoother
ways ot llfo to those who are tolling
up tho ruged steps ot life. Dut un
fortunately they are absent-minded
and careless like the brakeman; they
keep their light hanging up in places
where It Is of no avail. Wo can never
tell what will happen to us as we
Journoy along the great pathway ot
.life; on every side danger lurks; It Is
so Important that we keep our light
near our side In order that we may be
ablo to signal and mobilize our forces
for good. Keeping their lights under
cover is one of the first things that
the majority of persons1 who have abll
tty and Influence, glory in; this has
ben ono of the grent hindrances to hu
man progress. "Am I my brother's
keeper?" some may inquire. We aro
to the extent that we can advlso each
other for the best; and. to give help in
any way, and anywhere it is needed.
Having ability and influence and the
comforts of life. It is our duty to ap
preciate these by so living each day
that may be examples to those around
us.
Provldenco has not provided us with
all of these comforts for our own sat
isfaction, but we must let our light
shine, by helping those around us that
are in need, not financial need always,
but sometimes need of good counsel.
Keep your lantern nlways by your side
so you may be known for your good
works.

.RACES O' MEN.
By ROSCOE C. JAMISON.
Black man or white man,
Yellowmnn or Jew;
Lord can races matter
If men's hearts be true".
Can the clay give color
To the spirit's guide?
God do races differ
In the righteous eyes?
From one dust thou mad'st them,
Climates gave them hue.
Far apart their customs
Changed their language, too.
Isolation bound them t
Shut them from tho view
Of the common ideals
They together knew.
Yet thru all the ages
Carving wood or stone.
They, what'er they called thee
Sought tho great unknown
In jungle, cave or temple,
Pale, grove or church,
All have sought to know thee,
All have blundered much.
Now the morning cometh,
Walls are breaking down.
Human seas they mingle
Black and. white and brown.
In the world's four corners, .
Ancient kinships meet.
Ocean tradeways clamor
Like a city street.
God! Jehovah! Allah!
Thy high purpose prove
Send upon the races
Peace and joy and love.
Teach them they are brothers ,
Teach them to be true

To one who for ttie first time views
Seattle, with its magnificent buildings,
broad thoroughfares and beautiful
parksways, will have; difficulty in be
llvelng that less than 25 years ago
the city was devasted by a great fire
that did damage amounting to more
than $10,000,000, but. with her splen
did location, her vast resources and
indomitable spirit, she has risen Phoe-nlx-ltke
from tho ashes .until she is
the Queen City of the great North
west. And she is destined to be one
ot the great cities - of our country.
One of the peculiar atmospheric con
ditions of that section is the Chinook
winds, which blow In soft and highly
perfumed from the Pacific ocean, and
r.o matter how cold or how much ice
and snow may be on the ground, in
a few hours after these winds begin
to blow they disappear like a miracle
and 'tis as balmy as summer in our
section. !
Seattle has a climate well adapted
to the Southern colored man, and
there is no doubt but what the next
few years we are going to witness a
wonderful immigration, to that section
of our country. !
Seeing the, City.
Early the next morning the grand
secretary and myself started out on
foot to see the business section ot
the city, and we visited the, great
wharves which are ultimately to bo
the greatest in America; saw hun
dreds of sailing crafts and many sea
going steamers, but strange to say
nearly all were manned by Chinese
and Japanese sailors, due largely, they
say on the coast, to-the workings of
the berated and iniquitous LaFolIette
seaman's bill, which they alleged dis
criminates against the American sea
men. We vislteCUthoi creat market
house, which unquestionably Is the
most beautiful, most complete and
busiest public market wo have ever
seen. A great majority of the stall

keepers were also Japanese and Chi
nese, with, we are pleased to say, hero
and there a colored man. And the
wonderful bargains offered at the va
ilous stalls In the way of produce,
fruit, poultry and fish made us heart
sick, ns they were fully 100 per cent
less than the cost on the Kansas City
market. For Instance, we could buy
flvo large stalks of elegant, crisp cel
ery for C cents, the same kind we
pay 10 cents and 12 cents a stalk for
here. Lucious naval oranges at 10
cents a peck, fresh from the grove;
elegant Columbia river salmon, weigh
ing from two to five pounds, for from
10 to 2." cents each. Clams C cents a
quart, chickens from 25 to 35 cents
each that would cost here 00 to SC
cenls, and many other things in pro
portion. The highest thing we saw
in the way o' food stuff was eggs,
which sold from 40 to 00 cents per
dozen. While strolling down the prin
cipal thoroughfare window shopping
vii.' vere unceremoniously bumped
Into by scr.w one in a rough manner,
and as our anger arose we turned to
see who had been so rough in their
jostling, and behold. It was our niece
and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. F. M.
Shanon of Butte, Mont., who were vis
iting friends in the city and whom we
happened to meet by the merest acci
dent. To say that were glad to meet
them goes without a question, and
after Introducing them to the scrc
tary, we all had a delightful stroll and
chat, Mr. and rMs. Shannon wero
looking exceedingly well and wero m
joying themse'es Immensely, and
contemplated visiting the exposition
at Frisco before returning to their
home. After 'bidding them gjoci-liy
for the afternoon we returned to our
our hotel for luncheon, where we
found Brother Burr Williams, It. L.
Tutt, Walter Bates and Shack Harris
waiting for us with a big touring car
and we were given a 50-mile drive
over the city, where we had a chance
to view the lake, the ocean, the har
bors, the cascades, the snow covered
mountains from a faraway distance,
the harbor defenses, the beautiful park
system, the state university. China
town, homes of the prominent and
prosperous colored people of the city
and many other places of interest. In
the evening we were taken to one of
the foremost theaters where the grand
secretary had an opportunity to laugh
to his heart's content over the antics
of Charlie Chaplin, the comedian, and
thereafter wherever we saw a movie
house and the picture of Charlie Chap
lin there was no peace until the grand
secretary had had an opportunity to

HOME FOR NEGRO GIRLS.
It is with great Interest that we aro
watching for the opening of tho Indus
trial home for Negro girls recently
erected at Tipton.
On a recent visit to Tipton I visited
the institution then nearing comple
tion and was surprised and pleased in
deed to see the splendid buildings be
ing erected for this purpose. No pains
seem to have been spard to meet
every requirement. The sanitary floors
and walls, the beautifully appointed
baths and lavatories numbering twen
ty and more, the dormitories, class
rooms, dining room, kitchen modernly
equipped, serving pantry all bespeak
for the committee on building careful
foresight and consideration for the
purpose intended.
It Is gratifying also to know that
the board of directors have decided to
Install colored officers to have charge
of this splendid Institution; there will
be a lady superintendent and her as
sistants, consisting of a matron, house
keeper, cook, etc., to help carry on tho
great worlc ot training these girls and
making them good citizens.
Tho position of superintendent is an
important one and should fall on tho
shoulders of a responsible and compe
tent woman; one who has the interest
of these poor girls at heart and will
do all within her power to direct their
lives that they may yet become useful
and respected women.
Such a woman we firmly believo
would be found In the person of Mrs.
Estelle Weaver of Kansas City, an ap
plicant for tho position.
Mrs. Weaver is an unusually Intelli
gent, bright and energetic young wo
man, full of the risht spirit and ideas
to bo conveyed into this work. In re
ply to my question as to what sugges
tions she would offer relative to the
training given to these girls, she said
emphatically, "Teach them to work
to learn to do well everything about a
home; the laundering ot clothes, cook
ing a clean, wholesome meal, serving
a table, caro of a kitchen, dining room
and pantries, the care of a bedroom
everything pertaining to a well cared
for home. I have been engaged in this
work before," said Mrs. Weaver, not
with what was termed incorrigible
girls, but with girls who had not had
any home training, and It was very in
teresting to watch them develop -and
the pride they took In the tasks set
before them."
We feel that Mrs. Weaver has the
right idea and strikes tho keynote
when she says: "Keep the girls busy
learning useful things; get them in
terested and you have sent them a
long way on tho road to being useful
and respected citizens."
Mrs. Weaver has our hearty sup
port in her behalf. She Is a bright,
Christian little woman; the mother
ot several small children and recently
widowed. The state would do well to
secure so well equipped and efficlant
a worker. Not only is she splendidly
equipped mentally and physically for
this position, but sho came from ono
of the most Illustrious families of col
or in America, being a sister of Mrs.
Dr. J. E. Perry and Mrs. Dr. T. A.
Jones of this city, and a granddaugh
ter of the Immortal and Illustrious
Frederick Douglass.

A GREAT BOOK.
The new book, "My Work and Pub
lic Sentiment," by Mrs. Maria P. Will
iams, one ot our foremost women, who
resides in this city, Is creating more
interest and dlscusson than any other
book published by a Colored person in
recent years. It contains matters ot
much Interest, not only to the race, hut
to all the people of this country, and
is beautifully illustrated.
Mrs. WllIamB has done possibly more
than any of the other Colored women
In the West, both as an editor and
orator, and upon the political platform
she has proven herself an able and
courageous defender ot the rights pf
her people. As one brother said to
us concerning the book, "It's a hum
dinger," and If you don't believe it is.
just read it. Mrs, Wlliams is receive
