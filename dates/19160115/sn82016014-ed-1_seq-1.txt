New York, Jun. 15. Three men
were killed, three wt re fatally injured
and nine seriously burnt d by an explo
sion on board the t-ubmarine K-2 in
dry dock at the Brooklyn navy yard
this afternoon.
A defective battery is beli"Ved to
have caused the explwsion. The in
terior of the submarine was found in
flames by the party which rushed to
the rescue of the crew, on hearing the
boom. While H'Vtra! men worked
putting out the flames, others rushed
in and beiran di.ii: out the injured.
The officer of the day said that
w h i b only . n e man is known to be
dead, hp believed others of the nine
would die in a short time, they were,
so badly burned.
Several of the men were draped
from t he submarine's interior with
their clothing in flames.
Toting u lluttery.
It was reported that the engineers
in the navy yard were test inn one of
the new Kdison batteries installed in
the craft at the time of tiie explosion.
Thes- batteries were in t ended to ob
viate the danger to the crews of sub
miirrnes from pas fumes. Recently
submarines of the K class were report
ed to have made successful trips with
the hatterlcs in use.
Lit ter reports that came from the
navy ya rd were that twelve men had
been taken out from ,-iie hold seriously
injured and twenty wit h lighter in
juries. They were re mo veil to the
naval hospital in the yard.
Newspaper men - re barred from

could be confirmed through yard of-j
ficials and all details concerning the ;
uceideut were refused.
The submarine 10-2 was built in

capable of traveling 14 knots on the
win face and 1 I knots when submerged.
The K-2 in September. 1 y 1 4. had a
narrow escape from an accident simi

side Honolulu harbor.

Kas when the vessel was submerged 50
feet. He ran to the surface by using
the pumps instead of blowing out the
tanks. When the submarine reached
the surface the conning tower was
uuii-kly opened to give the crew fresh
air. Kvery one oi the nineteen mem
bers of the crew, it is said, were more
or less affected by the gas some
bleeding from the nose and mouth. As
a result of the accident, Knsign Gillam

person who can speak authoritatively
and who has acted as representative
of the American interest in connection
with British prize court proceedings
reviewed today for the Associated

"The British government shows an

Evans' famous dictum, that it is in

the British government with the Chi

the modification of the orders in coun

. New York, Jan. 15. A billion kisses
and love without end were promised
to pretty Cora Maud Clarke, young
widow, by John Leon Martin, broker
and clubman.
And for several years, according to
the story which Mrs. Clarke told to
a jury before Justice Lehman in the
supreme court, kisses and love were
bestowed liberally. Jewels, flowers,
fine clothes and trips about the coun
try were thrown in for good measure.
Then Martin ntopped visiting her.
And one day she read he had sudden
ly married Miss Maud C. Eddy, of
Grand Rapids, Mich. Tying up her
love letters into neat bundles and
brushing aside her tears, the widow
visited a lawyer and sued Martin for
$50,000 for alleged breach of promise.
Letters Are Read.
She brought forth the love missives
today and read them to the jurors at
the second trial of the action. When
the case first came before the court
she was awarded $25,000 damages,
but the appellate division reversed
this verdict and ordered a new trial.
Martin admits he was once engaged
to Mrs- Clarke. From 1104 until a
short time before he married Miss
Eddy ho and the widow were "very
good friends," he said. But one day
she became peeved and toid him "it
was all off." And after that, he says,
they never renewed the engagement,
although they were on close terms of
friendship.
