FILED AGAINST
A NEWSPAPER
Papers With Summons Returnable
Second Monday of Feb. in
Hands, of Prothonotary
John W. Reed, who recently re
tired as Common Pleas Judge of
Jefferson county, has filed a suit
against Gil. C. R*itz. president and
director; W. N. Conrad, director,
and John C. Dight, managing ed
itor, of the Brookville Republican,
for an alleged libelous article ap
pearing in the Republican of Feb.
11, 1915.
The suit is a civil one and the
damages sought amount to $lOO.-
000. t
The action is based on an arti
cle written by John C. Dight, ed
itor of the Republican, which the
Judge maintains was inspired by
Mr. Reitz and Mr. Conrad. It was
in answer to an article appearing
in the Brockwayville Record of
Feb. 5, 1915. This was immediate
ly following license court, and in
it the editor lauded Judge Reed.
The Republican i%i reply stated
that the "hypocrisy" of the court
would he wiped out at the Novem
ber election so that it would not
longer be visible. This, in addi
tion to other statements in the
same article, is the basis upon
which Judge Reed filed his suit for
damages.

ITALYTOTAKE
GRAIN CENSUS
Dispatch Tells of Action Being
Taken to Break Up Menace—
Decree Is Signed by Duke
Rome, Jan. 15.—A decree sign
ed by the Duke of Genoa as lieu
tenant general of King Victor Em
manuel orders that a census of all
grain be taken not later than Jan
uary 25. It is provided that any
person failing to announce the
quantity of grain he possesses or
makes any false statement is pun
ishable by a year's imprisonment
and $lOOO fine.
Another decree establishes rules
for the requisitioning of grain by
the military authorities. Resist
ance to requisition is punishable by
a year's imprisonment and $2OOO
fine, in addition to confiscation of
the cereals.
The census and requisitioning
measures are intended to prevent
speculation in cereals and to in
sure a sufficient supply for the ne
cessities of the army and the pop
ulation and to keep down prices.
The census decree makes it com
pulsory for whoever possesses
more than five quintals of cereals
tc announce the quantity and the
quality of the grain in his posses
sion. Each person may indicate
the quantity necessary for the con
sumption of his own family and
the agricultural laborers until the.
time for harvesting the new crop,
the average being three quintals
during the twelve months. He may
also indicate the quantity needed
for the next sowing and for food
for cattle.
• Information from a diplomatic
source says that an effort is now
being made by Austria and Ger
many to limit purchases of food
stuffs in Switzerland. This is said
to be the main cause for the low
exchange. The only possible rem
edy consists in the wholesale requi
sitioning of foodstuffs in Bulgaria,
the payment for these shipments
being made in paper money.

EDUCATION OF
FOREIGNCLASS
How to Assimilatd Foreigners Is
Question Before Meeting at
Philadelphia.
How to assimilate the millions
of foreign-speaking aliens in this
country and bring them up to the
highest standards of American cit
izenship, will be one of the ques
tions discussed at the national con
ference on immigration, at the
Bellevue-Stratford, January 20.
The conference will terminate
with a mass meeting at the Metro
politan Opera House, with Colonel
Roosevelt as the principal speaker.
The conference will be in charge
of the national Americanization
committee. According to a state
ment issued the other day by the
committee, there are in this coun
try upwards of 12,000,000 foreign-
born whites, of whom more than
11,000,000 are more than 21 years
old. In addition there are 12.000.-
000 persons of foreign parentage
in the United States.
"This seems," reads the state
ment, * * that in this country there
is a vast mass of foreign-speaking,
foreign-trained citizens in an un
assimilated or only partially as
simulated condition. Of the 11,-
000.000 foreign-born adults in this
country, only 35,614 were recorded
as attending school. These figures
present a grave problem which the
national Americanization commit
tee is attempting to solve.
•'Night schools are inadequate
for the training of the foreign
born; the children of immigrants
are thrust into overcrowded
schools, and the adult population
is made to depend upon the child's
immature interpretation of Ameri
ca, which is the only one many of
these adults now know.

Peace Steps
Seeks to Learn by What Compro

Rome, Jan. 15. —According to
reports here Pope Benedict hopes
to take his first practical step to
ward peace in the near future.
Pope Benedict has been con
vinced from the beginning of the
war that the restoration of Belgi
um by Germany was an impera
tive preliminary to any peace pro
posals. He has made this fact
known both to Germany and the
allies.
At the recent papal consistory
Cardinal Ilartmann, of Cologne, is
reported to have submitted to his
holiness the terms upon which Ger
many will consent to evacuate Bel
gium territory. The pontiff's next
step was to learn the views of the
Belgians themselves and Germany
consented to a visit to Rome by
the Belgian prelates.
Having learned Belgium's terms
the Pope plans to submit them to
Germany, hoping through these
negotiations to begin the series of
compromises necessary for peace.
