ACCOUNT BECAUSE
H J NT STRIKES BACK.
Arizona's Chief Executive Calls a
"Spade a Spade."
In a folder, entitled 'So the
People May Know,' now being
distributed broadcast in Arizona,
Governor Hunt says:
"If the hired agents and con
trolled newspapers, who are
now seeking my recall, should
throw aside their cloak of hypo
crisy, they would be driven to
the admission of their main
grievance, the frustration of the
organized effort of special in
terests to escape their just pro
portion of taxation and mean
while exploit the natural re
sources of the state at the ex
pense of permanent residents,
who, after mineral deposits are
exhausted, will lemain here and
hand down their heritage to pos
terity.
"The charge that I have disre
garded 'order and decency' is
presumably an illusion to the
fact that I have steadfastly re
fused to order militia to shoot
down hungry men and helpless
women and children in the Clif
ton-Morenci district. Such is
the conception of 'order and de
cency' harbored by such serpents
in human guise, as is Mr. Ray,
the former clergyman, who is
now deplorably prostituting his
doubtful talents by furthering a
selfish political conspiracv which
is the direct antithesis of that
benevolence and humanity ac
credited at all times to the cler
gy "To j'ield to the imperious
dictatorship of this 'foreign'
element under penalty, other
wise, of having it demand my
recall and use its money power
to make good its threat is the
ultimatum which I, as Goverrior,
confront. To those who have
known me well during my thirty
five years of residence in Ari
zona, no declaration of my posi
tion is necessary, but in fairness
to the thousands of citizen whose
personal acquaintance I have
never had the pleasure of mak
ing, I may, without equivocation,
give the solemn assurance, that
having my choice, I would cheer
fully accept recall at the hands
of these special interests rather
than yield in the measure of one
iota to their clamoring for un
usual privilege, compliance with
which would render me false to
my duty toward the people who
elected me to office.
"To further disprove the ridi
culous contention that the pre
sent State administration dis
courages capital, I may point, at
this time, to the unparalleled
prosperity of the mining, live
stock, agricultural and other in
terests which support the lead
ing cities of Arizona.
"The charge that 'unneces
sary commissions have been
created' doubtless relates to the
Tax Commission and Corpora
tion Commission by means of
which the tax burden was equit
ably distributed and the policy
of corporate laissez faire was in
great measure discouraged. It
is, moreover, worth while to ob
serve that the creation of com
missions and officers is solely a
legislative function in which the
Governor has but slight part.
It may be further stated that the
creation of the Tax and Corpor
ation Commissions was pursuant
to a mandate of the Constitution
ratified by the people of Arizona
in an election held for the pur
pose. The Governor's reponsi
bility for these Commissions,
therefore, is difficult of discern
ment, unless it be through the
'jaundiced eye' of a corporation
tax dodger.
"It has been charged that ex
travagance has resulted from
my policies as governor, that
the veto of certain sections of
the appropriation bill has result
ed in 'litigation' and 'huge ex
pense' that unnecessary commis
sions have been created, that a
state automobile has been main
tained; that because of my alleg
ed association with radical 'ele
ments' it has become 'unsafe' for
me to retain the governorship;
that my policies and acts have
rendered it impossible to enlist
foreign capital in 'attractive'
propositions which the state has
to offer' that for all these reasons,
linked to the necessity of 'con
serving the peace and dignity of
the governor should be recalled.
"To utterly refute the charge
that the state administration has
been extravagant, I may point
to official records showing that
the institutions and departments
under my personal official super
vision are beingcollecti vely oper
ated more economically than was
the case during the last terri
torial administration. Of course,
it should be noted that the great
boon of statehood carries with it
certain added responsibilities en
tailing in numerous instances ad
ditional expense such as results,
for example, from the abolition
of the reprehensible fee system
and the payment with state funds,
of all, instead of half, of the sal
aries allowed to public officers.
Will anyone contend for such a
reason, that statehood, with all
it3 incaliulable possibilities for
industrial and civic development,
be rejected ?
"It is right for me to show
that the allied special interests
have been scheming and conniv
ing for many months past to
first institute such actions as
would embarrass the state ad
ministration and thereafter make
the situation thus brought about
the basis of an attempt to recall
the governor. To make this
conspiracy plain, I may revert
to the 1915 session of the legis
lature during which a group of
individuals representing the
same interests that are. now de
manding my recall, appeared in
Phoenix and immediately insti
tuted a lobby characterized by
such pernicious devices as are
known to political corruption
ists for the enactment of a mine
tax law.
"This proposed measure not
only reduced the taxation re
sponsibilities of the large mining
companies, but virtually pro
vided that each company should
be fts'own assessor. As snch un
usual privileges were not ac
corded to the average citizen, a
determined minority in the leg
islature maintained, justly as I
believe, that they should not be
reserved to any single class of
property owners.
"Notwithstanding that moder
ation of conduct and of utterance
so fittingly become a public of
ficial, there are times (and this
is one of them) when to remain
silent in the face of abuse, or to
mutely regard the shameful lies
of irresponsible individuals, is
to be forgetful of one's duty to
ward his fellowmen."
Wherein Governor Hunt Offends.
The Public, of Chicago says:
"Governor Hunt of Arizona
has kept order in a mining strike
district without disiegarding the
constitutional rights of thestrik
ers without resorting to viol
ence. When he sent the militia
to the scene of the strike at Clif
ton he ordered strict impartial
ity in dealing with lawbreakers,
whether strikers agent or mine
owners themselves. Consequent
Jy, there have been no riots nor
Ludlow massacres. But one un
usual thing has happened. A
petition is being circulated for
Governor's Hunt's recall on the
alleged ground that he 'has de
liberately attempted to foment
and encourage class hatreds and
divisions; that he has been part
isan and prejudiced in his deal
ings with the most radical ele
ment, he has created a condi
tion approaching anarchy in cer
tain sections of the State. So it
appears that unless a Governor
takes sides in a strike againt
the strikers he caters 'to the
most radical element' and creates
'a condition approaching an
archy.' There is a little possib
ility that such reasoning can
bring about the Governor's re
call. But the attempt to do so
will probably make him popular."
Congressman Carl Hayden
is continuing to work earnestly
in an effort to secure an appro
priation from congress for the
construction of a federal build
ing in Globe. Although it is
feared that it will be some time
before the money can be obtain
ed and the new building erect
ed, Congressman Hayden has
given his word that he will keep
up the fight until it is won.
ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
Casa Grande is taking steps
leading to a bond issue for an
electric light, water an ice plant
to ba municipally owned. It is
proposed to issue bonds in the
sum of $35,000 for that purpose.
The Graham County Chamber
of Commerce ceased to exist as
an organization, December 31,
1915. The board of directors
decided that there was no fur
ther need of the organization at
this time.
A ladies' auxiliary to the Saf
ford Volunteer Fire Department
was organized Tuesday evening,
January 4th, and the following
officers were elected: Mrs. E.
H. Roach, president; Mrs. E. H.
Larson, vice presieent, and Mrs.
Wm. Kirtland, secretary and
treasurer.
The phenomal record of pro
duction for Arizona was reached
in 1915 by gold, silver, copper,
lead and zinc, amounting to al
most $90,000,000, jumping in one
year from $00,000,000. Yet Ari
zona has but started, according
to a bulletin received from the
Arizona State Bureau of Mines.
The output of gold, silver cop
per, lead and zinc of mines in
Arizona in 1915 was valued at
$88,551,000 according to the Unit
ed States government geological
survey, an increase of nearly
forty-eight per cent from that of
1914 which was $59,956,029.
There was very little change in
the amount of gold, but there
were notable increases in the
other metals, especially in lead
and zinc. Increased prices made
a difference of nearly $26,000,000
in copper, $400,000 in lead, and
over $2,000,000 in zinc. These
figures are the estimate of V. C.
Hughes, statistician of the sur
vey. NOTICE Or SALE OF FUNDING BONOS
