Daniels Starts Probe.
Secretary of the Navy Daniels was
at the National Democratic Club in
this city at the time of the explosion
delivering a lecture. He was notified
of the accident, but after the interrup

Secretary Daniels, however, dis
patched one of his aides to the Brook

Built, in 1910.
The submarine E-2 was built In 1910
and displaced 430 tons. She'was cap
attle of traveling 14 knots on the sur
face and 11 knots submerged. In
Sept. 1, 1914, she had a narrow escape
from an accident similar to that which
befell the F-4. While she was en
gaged. In maneuvers off Brenton reef
light ship, Efislgn Gillam detected
chloric ga«, when the vessel, was sub
merged fifty feet. He ran to the sur
face and the conning tower was quick
ly opened to give the crew fresh air.
Every one of the 191 members of the
crew. It was said, was more, or lesd
affected 'by the gas, some bleeding
from the nose and mouth.
As a result of the accident Ensign
Gillam was under medical treatment at
the naval hospital in Las .Animas,
Colo., for several months. \i-
Withstood Tests/-*-
The E-2 was the only vessel ln the
world equipped with the Edlson-Nick
ells batteries, and she made her first
trip successfully with them Dec. 7 last'
With Lieut Charles M. Cooke, Jr., In
comm&nd, the E-2 made an extensive
rUn on the surface, then divedr and
maneuvered for. several hours..
After these experiences the E-2 made
a successful run submerged. The run
proved. It was declared on excellent
authority, that the new batteries gave
better speed with less fuel.
The E-2 went tnto commission at
Boston in the spring of 1912. The boat
was built in the wards, of the Electric
Boat Company at Fore Rover, IMass.
The E-2, with. ,h0r sister ship, E-l,
were the first two naval vessels to be
equipped with th& Deisel oil burning,
interior combustion engines and they
•were the first submarines to be
equipped with -wireless telegraph ap

"The British government shows a
tendency now to shift around to the
American contention that the interna

Great Britain's assertion of her sea

It is well that when the war

the latter believed the neutrals could
be better met by orders in council and
the government began its interminable
agreements with neutrals.

"The compromise out of court by the
British government with the Chicago
packers is the best concrete effort of
the government to modify the orders
to meet demands.

Reported From London.
Washington, Jan. IB.—Press dls
patches from London telling of the
seizure of correspondence from Captain
von Papen, recalled German military
attache from the United States, when
he reached Falmouth, England, showed
he made payments to persons charged
with responsibility for blowing up
bridges and munition plants in the
United States, aroused Intense Interest:
hero today.
"I don't believe," was the only com
ment Count von Bernatorff, the Qer
man ambassador, would make. In Ger
man diplomatic quarters the Impres
sion was that It was possible that
Captain von Papen had been connected
with the published documents by Brit
ish agents. It was argued that von
Papen, with tho knowledge that his
ship would be taken into a British port
for search, would have carried any such
correspondence even If he possessed It.
At the German embassy It was said
that the ambassador had paid consid
erable money to von Papen as salary
and the expense of such work as ho
was expected to conduct as military at
tache. Embassy officials had no ac
count of his private bank aocount.
Administration officials declined to
comment on the dispatches pending re
ceipt of aoples of the correspondehce.
Responsible Only to Berlin.
It was made, clear at the German em
bassy today that Captain von Papen
was ln no way-responsible to/the am
bassador for hi* expenditures..
It- wao admitted—he
money on various occasions. B\or
expenditure he was solely responsible,
it was said, to tho German, war office.
Kmbafisy officials do not rscard tho
Situation as serious. They consider
tp£t as von Papen was withdrawn, the
question is at an end and publication
of evidence is now of little lmporuunoe.
As for the alleged payment of 1700 to
Werner Horn, It was said at the em
bassy that the money might have been
spent in counsel fees.
Embassy officials were interested In
the question of whether the check stub
was dated before or after the explosion'
which blew up the railroad bridge at,
St. Croix, Maine.
PAPERS CONVICT VON PAPEN.
Doouments Show He Furnished Money
to Dynamiter Horn.
London, Jan. 15.—The American em-i'
bassy Friday was given over for trans
mission to the state department copies
of correspondence seized from Capt.
Franz von Papen, recalled German
military attache at Washington, which
show that von Papen made frequent
payments to persons charged with re
sponsibility for blowing up munitions
works and bridges in the United States.
The correspondence was taken from
hlni at Falmouth by British authorities
when he was on his way to Germany.
One item in the correspondence
shows that the clay after $2,000 was
paid to von Papen from the German
embassy, he gave $700 to Werner Horn,
who was arrested in connection with
the blowing up of the Canadian Pacific
railway bridge at St. Croix, Maine.
Several large payments were made
to Captain von Papen by Count von
Bernstorff, German ambassador at
Washington.

of these were for
salaries or bonuses. A number of en
tries showed payments by the ambas
sador to the military attache for
"war Intelligence officc." One of the
payments-on this account, made in
October of 1914, was for $2,300. A check
stub found among the captain's papers
shows that about two weeks before
the explosion ln Seattle on May 30.
1915, von Papen sent $500 to the Ger
man consulate in Seattle. In Febru
ary, 1915, he sent $1,900 to the Seattle
consulate.
As an example of the size of the
captain's financial operations, his bank
book shows that ln January of 1915 he
received approximately $6,400 and paid
out $5,000.
Von Papen's check stubs, bank
books and letters from the Rlggs Na
tional Bank of Washington, show about
1500 items, many dealing with routine ex-"
pendttures. Payments to various per
sons who have figured prominently In
the activities of German agents in
America were revealed In others.
In January, 1915 Captain von Papen
gave a check payable to Amsick & Co.
New York, but with the name of E.
Kuepferle in brackets on the stub. This
is believed to have reference to the
man named Kuepferle, who after belnf?
arrested in England on a charge of es
pionage, committed suicide, leaving a
written confession tn his cell.
