THE DEAD TOWN.
Did yon ever go into a Town
and, and as you slopped from the
train, have it strike you suddenly
I hat the town was deadt Have
you ever slopped to analyze just
what it meant by these winds
'•dead towuf" In the last analy
sis i hey mean just one thing —
and that is that the merchants of
the town don't advertise. A
dead town has certain positive
aspects of demise which are as
bald as a piece of crepe hanging
on the door of a private house.
The stores seem to be merely ex
ist ing. Their shelves are oover
ed with apparently unsaleable
goods. The storekeepeis seem
to lie vying with each other to
see which will win the tirst prize
as t he town grouch. If you talk
e»l with them they knocked the
town, they knocked business,
'hey knocked the mail order
house. They were continually
complaining that other people
did business aud made money but
(hat they didn't seem to be «tile
to si'll anything. They guessed
it was the town. Yes, (bat was
if,— rlie town If you asked that
um reliant if lie advertised, h»
would have looked at you with
amazement What was the use
of advertising when business was
so bad? People who had money
to spend, he would tell yon, were
sending il to the mail ordet
houses. No, In* would ssy he
didn't advertise! Ho wouldu'i
throw good money after bad.
On t he other hand, go into a live
town ami what will you seaf The
merchants have attractive dia
plays in t heir stores. The daily
or weekly newspapers are filled
with big announcements of spe
cial sales or low priced goods.
They are not afraid of the mail
order houses because they bave
the same means to reach the
people— adver tia'tf —ilia'make«
I be mail order house great. The
merchants have their local asso
ciation for mutual help, and be
hind the association the local
newspaper is pushing-pushing
pushing. Everybody is working
and everybody is happy and
boosting. If you want a live
town get behind the newspaper
and the newspaper wid do the
rust. Forget the timeworn argu
ments ti»«t the paper la a daad
one The paper Is alive enough
if the people are alive. The sor
est test df a live town is a live
newspaper, and a newspaper
can't be alive unless the town
boosters do their shares.
