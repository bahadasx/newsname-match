Boync High
Win By Small
Margin Friday
Girls Win By. Two Points And
Boys By One. Game
Intensely Interesting
(From The Itoyne Citizen)
The basket ball season was formally
opened Friday night at the gym when
itoyne High boys and girls met and de
feated the East Jordan High boys and
girls. It was by no means an easy
task for either team and considerable
luck assisted the girls in annexing the
first victory. The boys game was in
tensely interesting, although far from
the class of ball seen at the close of last
season.
The girls took the floor first and for
several minutes played a slow game.
After the first few scores were made
however interest became enlivened.
East Jordan lead by a safe margin the
majority or the game. At the close the
scoreboard showed them leading by
r one point, 9 to 10. After several min
SJ utcs however, the scorers decided the
visitors had been accredited with one
point too many, and the score was a
tie. It was then agreed to Return and
play until the first basket, or,point was
made. Within two minutes IJoyne had
a field "basket and the game ended. Al
though the result favored the locals
candor demands it to be said that Boyne
will have to play better ball if they re
peat on East Jordan when they meet
again.
The real battle opened when Coach
Talcott blew the whistle for the begin
ning of the boys' game. East Jordan
has been preparing for sometime and
their work shows the results. Two
minutes was time enough to inform the
spectators that the locals had no easy
win. In fact odds would have been
placed on East Jordan the first quarter
which ended with the visitors leading
13 to 7. The next quarter saw tne best
work of the locals. More team work
was evidenced and the close of the half
showed Boyne leading 15 to 14.
"The second half was a heart breaker.
The score first favored one then the
other. The third quarter closed with
Boyne leading 21 to 19. The last lap
stimulated East Jordan and they rolled
up three field baskets and one free
throw, netting them 7 points, while
Boyne counted G. At no instant could
the end be foretold and as the whistle
.blew the locals congratulated them
selves on having the one count rather
than being one to the bad 27 to 28.

East Jordans' team work was develop
ed to a point above that of the locals
and from the side lints they appeared
the stronger team with the exception
of the center.

And Alonj Came Ruth
"Since mother has been sick," said
Ruth's cousin Mary, "I don't know
how to ventilate her bed-room on
rainy, winter nights. Can you tell me?
"Why yes, it's quite simple," re
plied Ruth, "You just take your sum
mer window screens, and tack over
one side of them a good cheese cloth,
and fit them into the upper part of the
window. . No matter how the rain
dashes, it runs down on the outside of
the cheese cloth and does not come in.
Neither does snow penetrate it. Then
too, the temperature of the room is
never uncomfortable as it is when
mere wire screens are used.' Your
mother will not only be snug and com
fortable, but seenre from storm and
wind."
"Oh, I'm so glad you know a way,
Ruth," said cousin Mary. "I was at
my wit's end to provide ventilation,
but your simple explanation settles the
whole matter."
Substitute for Glass
An excellent imitation and substitute
for glass has been made in Germany
and among the other uses to which it
has been put is that of making the
roofs of automobiles of it, whf-'j has
been found to be a desirable innova
tion. It affords a sufficient and safe
shelter and at the same time permits of
the interior of the car being lighted to
the fullest extent by daylight. The
mater' il is a .modification of celluloid,
but has many of the undesirable fea
tures of the latter eliminated.
Occasionally a man has the last word
in an argument with his wife, but . he
has to say it under his breath.

.County Normal Notes.
School opened Wednesday morning.
The students were all back after the
two weeks of Christmas vacation which
was pleasantly spent by all.
The school officers meeting was held
last Thursday at the Court House. Mr. i
Otwell, assistant state superintendent
led the discussions. The normal class
attended the sessions and profited a
great deal as the discussions were
mainly on school law and standard
schools.
The class have received tneir music
for commencement. The song is en
titled, "The Coralled Caves of Ocean,"
by Smart.
May L. Stewart, County School Com
missioner, visited the normal last Fri
day morning and gave a talk on the
standard schools which are being dis
cussed in the county.
Ethel Sanford of last year's class
visited the normal Friday morning and
gave an interesting talk on her work
of this year. She is teaching in Emmet
County.
Grace Meggison also visited the nor
mal Friday and talked on the condi
tions of her school and what would
have to be done to make it a standard
school. Miss Meggison was a "member
of the class of 1908 and is teaching the
Walker school.
Miss Himes spent her vacation at her
home in Normal, Illinois and Miss
Whiting spent her vacation in Charle
voix. All the disagreeable people don't
live on cross streets.
A lot of people, are disappointed in
love-aftcr marriage.

LYMAN II. HOWE'S .
TRAVEL FESTIVAL
Will Make Return Engagement
to East Jordan, February 1st.
This Is the era of rapid progress and
intense living. We are going full
speed ahead at such a rapid pace that
it is difficult to keep abreast of day to
day developments unless through such
a medium as Lyman H. Howe's Travel
Festival which comes to the Temple
Theatre on Tuesday, February 1st. By
way of illustrating this point, the read
or may remember that a short time ago
governmental wheels were set in mo
tion which ended in Congress creating
a new National Park. It is not only
our latest but one of our largest na
tional playgrounds and in many re
spects is entirely unlike any other with
in our boundaries. Yet it is doubtful
whether one reader in ten can recall
its name, location or size, and certainly
none could imagine its real grandeur.
So in order to reveal this new wonder
land adequately-rGlacier National
Park, comprising 1500 square miles
Howe's photographers penetrated to
its inmost recesses through courtesies
and facilities extended by the Great
Northern Railway. Then returned
with scenic masterpieces recorded on
their films which disclose the scope
and beauty of natural wonders that
are beyond comparison.
Commingled with the scenes of the
magic of the mountains are film studies
of the Blackfeet Indians of today in
their native haunts in Glacier National
Park. '
As is typical of Howe's exhibition, a
great variety of other scenes will be
presented, such as an aeroplane flight
above the clouds, a torpedo boat
struggling through a terrific gale, curi
ous examples of crystallization, adven
tures in the insect world, logging in
Italy, a graphic portrayal of- the move
ments of animals reproduced so slowly
that they show details which the hu
man eye could never detect, the Firth
of Forth bridge in Scotland, Madeira,
winter in the Swiss Alps, and one of
the greatest industries in our era show
ing every phase that enters into the
construction of the latest type automo
bile as seen on a trip through the
Willys-Overland plant at Toledo, Ohio.
Besides there will be freely inter
spersed many of those ever welcome
cartoon comedy films which always
form such a pleasing diversion in
Howe's productions.
To Clean Milk Bottles
and Mason Jars
There is nothing so time consuming
as the cleansing of milk bottles and
Mason jars and in fact any kind of a
utensil that the hand will not go into.
To make these jars and bottles clean
and sparkling, .take a paper napkin,
you can buy them by the hundred for
very few cents, and crush it gently in
the hand. Place in the bottom of the
jar with a little shaved soap and about
an inch depth of boiling water. Place
the hand over the open end of the jar,
or screw the cap on and shake the jar
with rotary movements. After half a
dozen revolutions of the napkin, soap
and water around the inside of the jar
will be perfectly clean and very bright.
If you have a dozen jars to clean,
you may pour the contents of the
cleaned jar into the next one to be
cleaned.
Try it. See how quickly and easily
the work is accomplished. Ex.
BOLTS WANTED.
We want to buy a few hundred cords
of four-foot bolts in hemlock, spruce,

ELBERT BEDE SAYS
Charity may cover a multitude of
sins but it doesn't obscure them from
the public gaze.
We suspicion some folks say times
and hard and business dull just to
keep you from thinking that they are
making money;
Wben a woman talks to you at the
top of he voice there is little need to
worry. She never asks you for money
except in a low voice.
It is quite a trick to raise and sup
port a half doZen boys, but not nearly
as much of a trick as it is to raise them
so they will support you.
The prettier a woman is the harder
it is for her to keep from feeling jea
lous when some other woman's good
looks are commented upon.
When a man begins telling that he is
offering as a sacrifice to the people, it
is a pretty safe guess that he considers
himself more than a majority.
A Berkley student is able to hold his
breath for ten minutes. The chances
arc that he may never marry and his
accomplishment will be valueness.
Woman insists in putting a man into
a position where to be polite he must
say she doesn't look her age and then
tells around that he is a natnral born
liar.
An exchange warns us to "beware
of the woman who agrees with you."
What's the use of wasting time in
warning us against something that will
never happen.
When a man marries a leading chorus
girl, who has had her undressed-up
picture in the paper, everybody knows
as much about what he is getting as he
docs himself.
If the socialist propaganda will do
half what its advocates claim it will, it
will fulfill about ten times as many of
the promises made for it as any other
It's easy to sit around the sawdust
box in a country store and solve great
problems of state because those who
solve problems there are never called
to account for their mistakes.

Washington. In the United States
are multitudes who imagine that the
greatest sinecure one can enjoy in
this life Is to be an employe In the ex
ecutive civil service of the United
States government in Washington.
But 25,351 persons have learned from
personal experience that such is not
the case.
When these Individuals who are not
In the service contemplate the govern
ment clerk being granted 30 days' an
nual leave, and that If the clerk Is
eick he is allowed, by a merciful pow
er, 30 days more in which to recuper
ate; when these facts possess them
they grow envious and wonder why
the fates have not dropped them into
ona of these many easy berths.
And when these dissatisfied ones
meditate upon the hours the govern
ment employe is supposed to work
from 9 o'clock to 4:30 o'clock with
one-half hour for lunch it is too
much for them, and they determine
that come what may they will take
the civil service examination for a
position at Washington. They also
thinlc of the government employe- at
Washington who is supposed to stop
his work at 1 o'clock on Saturdays
during July, August and September.
When these position-seekers at
Washington pass the examination
and finally secure the coveted appoint
ment they soon discover a number
of pertinent facts; They find that of
the men in the District of Columbia
employed by the government, 44.2 per
cent are paid at a rate of less than
$1,200 a year. In the case of women
the percentage of those paid at a rato
less than $1200 a year is 73.1 per cent.
The newly appointed employe sees
that 48.6 per cent of the women, as
contrasted with 16.3 per cent of the
men, are in the class paid at a rate of
less than $720 a year. In the District
of Columbia the lowest average rate
Is $630, paid to employes under 20
years of age.
hsjpermitted to choosejhe de
partment "orTjureau in which they may
desire to locate themselves, may bo
guided by these averages. First comes
the department of Justice with an av
erage salary of $1588; the war and
navy building average is, $695 lowest.
The department of state averages
$1310; Department of the Interior,
$1257; Post Office Department, $1,223
and Bureau of Engraving and Print
ing $719.
Women are more numerous among
the employes here than elsewhere. In
Washington 7358 are women, or al
most 3 in 10, while the employes else
where only 6463 are women, or 1 to
25, although the total number of em
ployes in the district Is less than one
sixth of the total number outside.
Of the employes in the government
service at Washington 2785, or 11 per
cent are negroes and 1852 persons at
least 65 years of age, which means
that practically one Government em
ploye in 14 is at least that age.
The new arrival will learn that
30.3 per cent of his associates have
been employed by the Government
less than 5 years; 25.2 per cent from
5 to 9 years; 24 per cent from 10 to
19 years; 12.6 per cent from 20 to 29
years; 5 per cent from 30 to 39 years,
and that 2.2 per cent have been serv
ing 40 years and over.
By the time our civil service ap
pointee has gained this knowledge he
has learned that the work in Wash
ington is not Just what he imagined
It to be, but if he has a . Job the
chances are he will keep It, but wish
he was back home.
