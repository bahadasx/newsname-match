A BOOST FOR THE ZINC BELT
United States Geological Survey Re
port Indicates a Greater Boom In
Prices this Year.
Tho unprecedented prosperity ot
the zinc smelting and zinc mining in
dustrieswith tho MlsBOUrl-Kansas-Oklahoma
mines and smelters leading
In the general boom since "war prices"
on zinc began Is told In the annual
report on that industry which the
United States Geological Survey has
Just made public.
This prosperity story which Jop
lln and the other towns of that par
ticular district already have enjoyed
Is summed up In this paragraph ot the
report:
"Though tho total spelter produced
In the United States In 1915 Increased
40 per cent over tho preceding year,
the value of the output increased near
ly 300 per cent. However, even this
doesn't ropresen tthe true value, for
It la based on the average price of
Western spelter, whereas there was
a large production of brass special, In
termediate and high grade spelter, all
of which command premiums. The
real value ot the spelter output was
thereforo probably between 10 and 25
per cent more than the value as
given."
The report shows that In the United
States the recoverable zinc content of
zlno ores mined in 1915 was over
560,000 short tons, compared with 407,
000 tons In 1914, and 418,000 tons In
1913. With a continuance of high
prices for spelter during 1916 the out
put will be greatly augmented, for the
very high prices did not begin until
April and May, and It was naturally
some timo before much additional zinc
mining could get under way.
For the same .reason tho output of
spelter during 1916 should be much
greater than It was in 1915, provided
tho spelter market remains tho same.
Tho output during the first half of
1915 was at tho rato of 433,000 tons a
year; during the last half it was at the
rate of about 550,000 ton3.
RECEIVED MEDAL OF HONOR
Missouri Was First In Everything at
San Francisco Fair From Apples
to Persimmons.
At the Panama-Pacific exposition,
which recently closed at San Francis
co, Missouri won the medal of honor
awarded for general agricultural ex
hibit and the grand prize for installa
tion, in addition to seventeen gold
medals, twenty-one sliver medals, fif
teen bronze medals and two honor
able mentions.
From apples to persimmons and
pawpaw3, Missouri was first at Fris
co. Missouri's horticultural exhibit
was awarded the medal of honor, and
In number of medals won Missouri
was second only to California for
fruit. At this same great interna
tional exposition Missouri was award
ed raoro medals on apples than were
won by any other stato or country.
With two great apple regions, tho
Ozarks and the loess soil districts,
Missouri not only produces apples of
quality, but apples in quantity.
Nor aro apples all! With the an
nual peach production from one little
district alono amounting to 1,000 car
loads, with a strawberry crop ot halt
a thousand carloads from another
group of counties, and with fruits of
various kinds on practically every
farm, Missouri Is, of all the Missis
sippi valley states, first In fruit.
Missouri is tho first poultry state
In tho Union, figured either in pounds
or premiums. Tho value of Mis
souri's surplus poultry products is
now estimated at moro than $50,000,

FRUIT LAXATIVE
"California Syrup of Figs" can't
harm tender stomach,
liver and bowels.
Every mother realizes, after giving
her children "California Syrup ot
Figs" that this Is their Ideal laxattvo,
because they love Its pleasant taste
and it thoroughly cleanses tho tender
little stomach, liver and bowels with
out griping.
When cross, irritable, feverish, or
breath is bad, stomach sour, look at
the tongue, mother! If coated, give a
teaspoonful of thls harmless "fruit
laxative," and In n few hours all the
foul, constipated waste, sour bile and
undigested food passes out of the bow
els, and you havo a well, playful child
again. When Its llttlo system Is full
of cold, throat sore, has stomach-ache,
diarrhoea, indigestion, colic remem
ber, a good "Inside cleaning" should
always bo the first treatment given.
Millions of mothers keep "California
Syrup of Figs" handy; thoy know a
teaspoonful today saves a sick child
tomorrow. Ask at tho store for a 50
cent bottle of "California Syrup of
Figs," which has directions for babies,
children of all ages and grown-ups

WAR HAS ITS LIGHTER SIDE
British Soldiers Quick to Seize Oppor

When Occasion Offered.
Even In their odd moments of lei

scribed in an officer's letter in Great
Deeds of tho Great War.
"Many thanks for the parcel. The
mouth organs nrrlved when wo were
resting and were billeted In a very
large vinery. We formed up a band
and marched round the building. We
had all sorts of instruments in tho
band; tho big drum was an empty
packing enso, and the drumstick an In
trenching tool handle with a piece of
sacking tied round tho end; empty bis
cuit tins were sldo drums; tin whis
tles, squeakers and combs and paper
came in ns well.
"Candles and electric lamps gave
the illumination, and It was really
very funny to see this band of about
thirty marching round the building,
headed by the self-appointed drum ma
jor and conductor in a goatskin, twirl
ing a big stick that I uso In feeling my
way to and from tho trenches. After
marching round once or twice, wo
formed up In a ring In tho middle and
had vocal and Instrumental turns un
til our feet began to get cold, when
we had another march round. Of
course it was all very silly, but we en
Joyed tho fun."

they might take Babe and Mlko to
carry their heavy packs.
Rutherford demurred, for he fearod
storms; but tho men persisted, saying
that unless they reached homo before
tho 25th, their children would havo
neither presents nor Christmas din
ners. That plea was moro than tho
tender-hearted young man could with
stand, and he let them take the ani
mals, exacting a promise that thoy
would return them as soon as tho sled
road opened.
Tho travelers started nt daylight,
taking tho trail over tho summit. That
night a terrific snowstorm swept tho
mountains. Rutherford was worried,
but tried to believe that the day's
start had enabled tho men to fight
their way to the lower country. On
January 3, ho snowshoed over to Ta
hoo post offlco, whero he found a
crumpled post card from ono of tho
men, Informing him that they had
boen caught In tho storm and had to
abandon the animals to save their own
Uvea.
Tho next day Rutherford started out
to lmd Babe and Mike. He traveled in
the sticky snow across tho' summit to
Bryson's camp, and tho next day two
or three miles farther. He had hardly
expected to find Babo or Mlko alive,
but as ho camo round a bluff ho was
delighted to sco tho two animals stand
ing disconsolately side by side. He
yelled at them and Babo whinnied
back, although ho was almost too de
jected and weak to move.
The animals had trampled; n place
about ten feet oquare under a tama
rack tree, and had nover moved out ot
it. Thoy had gnawed at the saddle
blankets and the hair ropo, and had
even nibbled each other's tails and
manes. Tho snow was flvo and a half
feet deep all around them.
Rutherford shoveled a trail to tho
river. In doing which ho fell through
tho Ice three times. He had to undress
and wring out his clothes In tho bitter
cold. Then bo watered tho horses,
and Immediately set out for Bryson's
.camp. Tho animals wero too weak to
follow. At tho camp ho got a half bale
ot hay and carried It down on his
back, traveling on skis.
The next day ho went to shoveling
again, and worked at It all day long.
At daylight ho got up, carried more
hay down to tho horses, and put in 12
hours more ot shoveling.
It was torrlbly heavy work, for thero
were six inches of soft snow, then four
inches ot frozen crust, and below that
a mass of wet snow. When he got
back to Bryson's he was so weary ho
could hardly crawl up tho steps.
Wednesday It snowed hard and filled
up his laboriously mado path, and
.Rutherford changed his tactics. Ho
determined to mako snowshoes for tho
horses; but ho could find nothing at
nil of which to mako them. Then ho
thought of putting down board In three
sections, two boards wide, moving tho
horses upon the first ones and then
taking up tho rear ones. Loaded with
hay and planks, ho fought his way Into
tho blizzard. It took him tour hours
to get down to tho horses.
Tho next day ho carried down moro
planks and tried to put his plan Into
execution. It was a failure tho boards
simply shot out from under tho borsoa
In every direction across tho crust!
Just then two other men whom ho
knew appenroJ, coming up from Straw
berry camp farther down tho moun
tain. They told him it was no uso,
and advised him to shoot the animals.
But Rutherford would not, and that
night ho thought of tho way out ot his
difficulty. There wore somo cowhides
and sheepskins hanging In Bryson's
camp. These he carried down to the
tamarack tree whero Babo and Mlko
still stood, and whero hla two friends
of the day boforo Joined him. Thoy
quartered tho cowhides, put tho sheep
skins inside for filling, and bound tho
clumsy bundles round tho feet of tho
animals ono to each foot.
About three o'clock they wore ready
for the now experiment. Ruthorford
says ho actually cried when ho found
It was going to work! Babo and Mlko
wobbled down to tho end of tho ditch,
climbed out on top ot the snow, and
mado pretty good progress, sinking In
only a few Inches, They reached
Strawberry camp boforo dark, Fronn
there It was not yery hard to get thai
animals down Into the Sacramento
valley. -Youth's Companion.
