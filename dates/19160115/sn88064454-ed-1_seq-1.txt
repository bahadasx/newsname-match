GOOD ROADS.

We feel that the wind is begin
ning to blow towards good roads,
as you can hear this matter dis
cussed everyday on our streets, we
. have some very active advocates of
good roads, who are willing to tax
. while others are apparently indif
ferent, but those who are indiffer
ent, do not realize the real situa-.
tion. All our neighboring towns
and parishes are paving their
1 streets and gravelling their public
highways. UnlOs we make an
effort to keep our roads in as good
condition as our neighbors, we will
. lose the trade of the country peo
ple who will not come to us on our
muddy and boggy roads if they
can go elsewhere on fine, dry gra.
vel roads.
Think of this matter seriously,
as you will soon have to take an
active park in this important mat
ter. We feel that the people are
realizing the necessity of good
permanent roads.

Teaching Agriculture.
The demand for properly trained
men to teach agriculture in secon
dary schools is greater thin the
supply and, from present indica
.tions, will continue to increase for
some time. Hitherto, compara
I tively few men have studied agri
culture with the deliberate inten
tion of teaching it as a lifework.
In consequence, while provision
for agricultural education has been
i greatly developed, the number of
