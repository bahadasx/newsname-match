HARRY WitSOI
Popular Candidate Commisomsr Aricuelture
' Mr. Harry Wilson, w'ho is a candi-,
date for the office of Commissioner
> of Agriculture and Immigration, is
well known in St. Tammany parish
* because of the interest he has taken
in advncing its several under
takings for the development of
trucking and the organization of as
sociations. He has always been
"Johnny on the spot" whenever he
r. could help us,, The consequence is
that he will get a big vote in this -
z. parish. But Mr. Wilson is chiefly
entitled to the office because of his
great knowledge of the needs of the
State in agricultural and immigra
tion matters. He knows conditions
by reason of personal contact with
the people, and his study of the fm
'migration question and the means of
agricultural advancement, together
with the routine and practical ex-i
rience he has had in the office,
cially fit him for it.
Mr. J. E. Glisson announces tha'-X
he is making splendid headway in his ]
;cawdidacy for Register of the Land
O.Oice. He claims quite a strong sup
port in New Orleans and the situa
ioen is flattering in other parts of
the State. As a :ocal man, he should
'pol a strong vote in St. Tammany
ish, especially as this section has
er been given a state office.

RECITES SOME FACTS
.OF IMPORTANCE
Reasons Why Voters Should
Rally to His Support In
Coming Election.
F To the Voters of the Parish of St.
S Tammany:
As the date of the primary elec
tion draws near, and the hitter par
an feeling exhibited by some
its bitter climax, I feel it
' cument upon myself to reiterate
my position as a candidate for re
election to the important office of
sheriff -of -our parish.
:x I cannot help but feel honored by
the unswerving confidence in my 1
Shonesty and integrity, manifested on 4
more than one occasion by the people I
% of St. Tammany parish. In the per
formance of my duty I have given "
many of the best years of my life
and in return for this I have had the
. pleasure of enjoying the honor and I
esteem of every man. woman and
Schild in St. Tammany parish. I can
not convey in this manner my deep- .
us.ated feeling of grat.i td for tals, '
bu can only assure you a;! that my a
fature life and conduct will continue 1
to reflect my official and private con- I
- et of the pmt. -o
Myself and my legion of friends in
St. Tammany parish have waited in f
vain for my opponent to advance ar e
Sargument worthy of notice. In an a
7 endeavor to find some salient excuse *
in appealing for votes, it appears that y
the- opposition has had to content a
itself with one form of specious ar- ti
*apment, that is, the length of tim'
I have enjoyed the confidence an' i
s.pport of the people of our parish r
-- Ordinarily, I presume it would bh a
well to ignore any attempt made t·
.detract from my candidacy by com- p
'menting upon the duration of m: ¶
term in office. uit in view of the i
fact that my rival has attempted t' o
eapitalze this asset on his own be- a
half, I am glad rf the opportunit: e
Presented to defend myself and many te
friends, under t~e most favorabit ri
auspices. p
It has been my privilege to serve ix
the people of St. Tammany parlsb p
for fifteen years, and I look forwarc l
with pleasure to the opportunity of
s.erving them another term as sheriir U
-&4and tax collector of our parish. In ti
looking back over the expanse of g
years I have presided over the desti- d
iales of my office, I would not be of
human mold if I did not rejoice inII
a feeling of flattery when I say that at
rmy offitcial and private conduct hat Si
b-een as near flawless as could pos ft

the parish, because it would offer
the opportunity that is demanded by
the up-to-date educational system in
vogue in the more prosperous see
tions. It gives the young farmer a
chance to make good and encourages
him to stay on the farm.
Of course it will take money and
work to accomplish this object and
means are being considered for car
rying It through. It is mainly a
question of co-operation and honest
endeavor. In order to expedite the
w-ork and create special interest,
when the first five acres is cleared
there will be a plowing contest with
a silver cup as the prize. This cup
will afterwards be handed over to
the Parish Fair Association, where
it will again be competed for, the
team winning it three times to hold
It.
It is contemplated to buy enough
adJoining land to finally have a farm
of forty acres. These plans are sub
Jec to discussion and any improve
ment that may be suggested will be
gladly received. It is planned to
give a basket picnic to the pttrons
of the school and to raise money by
subscription and otherwise.
Grantham said: "By the way, Bon
ny, how about that five dollars you
owe me" Bonny replied. "1 have
already paid it to you, Rougier."
Grantham said. "You are a liar.'
Bonny replied, "You are another."
Grantham then said, "You are a ly
in. ...... b ...... ," and started
out of the buggy with his hand in
his hip ppcket. Aldrich picked up
a stick five feet long and four inches
thick -and -acked away from 1
buggy about forty feet, Gran*ham

"I'L kill your soul if you continur
to aIdvnce on me." Grantham again
advanced and Aldrich struck him in
the head with the stick. He tell
unconscions and remained so for
twenty minutes. Aldrich remained
with the. others. When Grantham
came to, he got up and. started to
ward Aldrich with his knife. Bush
took the knife away from him.
They then placed him in the buggy
and he left in-a half dazed condition,
and: it Is understood that he fell out
of- the buggw skinning the whole
right. side of his face. He was
eventually taken to the home of A.

To the Honorable President and
Members of the Parish Board of
Scaool Directors. of St. Tammany
Parish, La.
Gentlemen:-I take pleasure in
presenting the following as my usual
quarterly report for quarter ending
December 31, 1915.
AMI of the waite schools are now
in session, with the single exception
of the one you ordered opened at
Honey Island. Here the Globe Box
Company nas suspended operations
and many of the peowie have moved
away, theaetore makng a, school at
present unnecessary.
At a recent meeting you ordered
the pupils from the Todd school to
attend the .iacomoe school and, for
me to put two teac.ers at this school
in order. to take care of the increas
ed number. This l.attempted to put
into enect. However, I round after
a trial that the attendance at La
combe was below thirty, the number
required for two teachers, and the
new bridge across the bayou will
not be completed for some weeks
yet.. This would therefore make it
impossible for the Todd children to
cross to ,Lacombe. It was for these
reasons that- Dr. Farmer and I
thought best to transfer the assist
ant at Lacombe to the Todd 'neign
borhood as the patrons there have
fturnished a house for the school.
Tae new Fendltaon and Pilgrim
Rest school houses have been com
pleted, and are models of their size
and style. Some new furniture has
been ordered for them and more will
be necessary. With the completion
of these schools we h .e nothing Obut
new, modern an dup.to-date school
buildings in this ward. I now trust
that the attendance in the schools
of this ward will improve so that
the hcildren may reap the benefit
from t-hese improved school facilitie:
that belongs to them.
The three new school transfers
you directed me to secure are now it
operation. One was made here in
Covington by Mr. August Verges and
the other two by Oster Brothers, o1
New Orleans. I feel that they are
good ones and will last, the parish
for years.
Tae operation of these transfers
has proven satisfactory in all cases,
so far as I know, with the exception
of the one running up the Turnpike,
in the first ward, toward Goodbee.
You will remember that the original
idea was to have this wagon go as
far as the crossing of the B. R., H.
& E., near Goodbee station.
By doing so we had hoped to have
the transfer go within reach of the
children living near -Cooney's saw
mill. This was before the mill shut
down and the people moved away.
After the transfer had Ibeen in opera
tion. a few weeks we beame con
vinced that this distance of seven
miles was greater than we could ex- I
pect to successfully cover with tw'
round trips av day. It was then or
to Mr. Dutsch and myself to either
compel Stein and Galatas to forfeit
their bond by not doin; as, they had

I shall submit on- another sheet

feel that I stn I e W ty re

that it was your tiire that - do'

because of this tha you made the
appropriation of $, ear year for
this purpose. I hb ` daring the

the Talisheek, Centr and Audubon

'under Ordinarye Cir istances If I
had not been for tih desire to get
these schools ready for the superin
tendents' convention Which will meet
wira us on January 2', and 28.
After this convention.ZI desire to give
my attention to the 'schools of the
parish where I have not been.
As I have stated 8btfore the state
department of education will hold a

and seaool board gn~iPers here in
