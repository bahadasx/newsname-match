Republican A. P. Leased Wire
LONDON, Jan. 14 Copies of the
correspondence taken a"t Falmouth
' from Capt. von Papen, were turned
over today to" the American am
hassador for transmission to Wash
ington. They show that von Papen made
money payments to the persons now
charged in American courts with re
sponsibility for the plots to blow up
munitions works and bridges.
One entry shows that von Papen
gave J700 to Werner Horn, who was
convicted of dynamiting the Cana
dian Pacific Railay bridge at St
Croix, Me.
Another check stub shows that
about two weeks before the explo
sion at iseaiue on May au, isid,
von Papen sent $500 to the German
consulate there.
The following four letters found
among Captain von Papen's effects
are considered the most interesting
part of the correspondence turned
over to the American embassy. The
first is a letter from R. von Mey
senbug, German consul at New Or
leans to Captain von ' Papen. The
letter follows:
"New Orleans, December 4, 1913.
"Dear Herr von Papen:
"I read with great regret that the
fate of recall has indeed overcome
you I don't suppose that you are
very unhappy to be able to shake
the dust of this unfriendly country
from off your feet. What chiefly
offends ine'ls that 'in always giving
way to the government here, we have
never found that they are kindly
disposed against us. The demanded
recall was so sudden and belated
that it throws an interesting light
upon the government here. May
here also the day of reckoning come
and our government find that iron
determination with which alone one
can make an impression here.
"Hoping - that our connection
formed in this great time will not
come to an end with your departure,
I am,
"Yours sincerely.
R. V M."
The second letter is from Dr. F.
W. Meyer to Captain von Papen. It I
is as follows:
"New York, 19 December 1915.
"Dear Captain:
"Best wishes again on the occas
ion of your departure. I had occas-i
ion yesterday to thoroughly discuss
recent events with some Germans.
As was natural, although there was
a general agreement on main points,
there was a slight difference of
opinion, indeed it could not have
been otherwise', especialjy as we are
rather cut off from the- other side.
The Austrian is of course, a matter
for general enjoyment and the whole
business can scarcely be taken
tragedieally. The president this time
has talked a bit too big even for
those who blindly support him. But
we were all of the opinion that the
departure of you and your colleague
is a serious - loss for us. Though a
majority of those present had scarce
ly had an opportunity of knowing
you personally, a privilege which
has been a great pleasure to me, yet
your efforts have always been es
pecially spoken of and more perhaps
than you think. 1 think, therefore,
I am speaking in the name of all
when I express to you the thanks
of alt of us for your faithful vig
ilance and unremitting labors under
the most difficult circumstances and
to this I add my own special thanks
for your attention to my little pro
posals. "It's not surprising in view of the
fictitious neutrality of the president
that the end should have been put
to ypur work and you must carry
back with you the knowledge that
you have done your duty according
to the best of your ability as long
as it was possible. Our people never
forget this of you. - .

The third letter was written by
General Friedrich A. J. - von Bern

"Posen General Headquarters,

"Dear Captain:
"I beg to thank you most sin
cerely for your kindness in sending
me a copy of the New York Sun
containing vmy two articles. I am
glad to hear these articles will, in
your opinion, have a good effect as
far as that is at all possible in
America. The advertising manner in
which they publish things, of course,
is thoroughly American. The pri
vate communication of ' mine ' has
been printed without any authority
from me. I have now written two
further series of articles for Amer
ica. The foreign office wanted to
have the first of these, entitled
'Germany and England' distributed
in the American press and the other
entitled Tan-Germanism' (?) was to
appear in the Chicago Tribune. I
should be very grateful if you could
forward me one copy each of these
articles. They will certainly have
some sort of effect. This is evident
from the inexpressible rage with
which the British and French press
have attacked these two Sun ar
ticles. They have insulted me in
the most increditible way. How
ever, I agree with you that military
success will be a decisive factor for
opinion in America. But also Eng
land's interference in American trade
will not fail to have a certain ef
feet. I hope both will take effect
together. I think, however, that es
pecially in the west where I expect
there will soon be' a big attempt to
break through, we have serious and
difficult times to look forward to,
but I confidently believe that we
shall successfully overcome them.

VON BERNSTORFF
German Ambassador Makes
Only This C o in m e n t
When Shown Dispatches
Telling of the Captain
von Papen Incident
Republican A. P: Leased Wirel
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14. When
Count von Bernstorff, the German
Ambassador, was shown London dis
patches tonight telling of the corre
spondences and the accounts ta"ken
from Captain von Papen, the former
German military attache here, his
comment was:
"I don't believe it."
I Further than that, the ambassador
declined to be quoted for publication.
He did make it plain, however, that he
doubted that any documents of an in
criminating nature had been taken
from Captain von Papen, although he
advanced no theory of how the corre
spondence and accounts described in
the London dispatches had been con
nected with him.
The impression which was conveyed
to questioners by officials in German
diplomatic circles was that they
thought it possible that Captain von
Papen had been connected with the
published documents by British agents.
Their argument was that it was in
creditable that von Papen, knowing
that his ship would be taken into a
British port to be searched, would have
carried anv correspondence of such a
nature if he possessed it.
They recalled that when the British
officials at Falmouth searched von
Papen's personal effects, he protested
t0 American Ambassador Page In Lon
flon. Tonight the German officials de
clared that had the' captain carried the
papers described they thought it un
llke'y that lie would have called fur
ther attention to them bv protesting to
an American official. His protest at
the time was forwarded to Count von
Bernstorff here, who sent it to the
stiite department. There was no ac
ti"n, and it was said that the cafe con
duct which the allied governments had
given Captain von Papen merely guar
anteed his passage home to Germany
ssfe from seizure as a prisoner of war
and did not affect his baggage or
pa pers.
At the embassy tonight it was said
that the ambassador from time to time
had paid much money to Captain von
Papen in the way of salary and for the
expenses of such work as he was ex
pected to conduct as a military at
tache. The embassy, it was said, had
no knowledge of his private bank ac
count or of how he disbursed the
money.
Embassy officials specifically dis
elaimedany knowledge of the reported
payment of $700 to Werner Horn, con
nected with the attempted destruction
of a. Canadian Pacific bridge. The?

itors of Green and others and has
tentatively arranged with them to
become his bondsmen.
He has been N in correspondence
with Green for some months looking
to his return to Phoenix and all the
letters from the latter have been
turned over to the sheriff. Other
letters have also been received from
Green, one by Sims Ely, manager
for the Valley Bank Adjustment
company and which was printed by
The Republican.
The correspondence with Green
was carried on through his son, an
attorney of San Jose, Cal. The ne
gotiations for his return are said
to have grown out of a suggestion
by W. H. Plunkett, receiver for the
United States Title and Legacy com
pany, who said he believed that
Green could realize more from the
assets - of the company than any
to nanaie tnem so that all claims
against the company would be met.
It has been ascertained too, that
many of the claims against the
company were spurious and probably
would not have been made but for
tht belief that he would not return
willingly. It was estimated at the
time of his flight last summer that
fraudulent transactions , amounting
to as much as $175,000 would be
discovered but they have not been.

CARRANZA TO BE GIVEN
OPPORTUNITY TO RUN
SANTA YSABEL BANDITS
De Facto Government of
Mexico to Have Time to
Demonstrate Ability to
Restore Order and Protect
Foreign Rights
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14. General
Carranza and the de facto government
of Mexico are to be given a fair op
portunity without intervention of the
I'nited States to run down the mur
derers ofthe American citizens at
Santa Ysabel, and to demonstrate
ability to restore order and protect for
eign rights in the southern republic.
This was the outstanding fact here
tonight after a meeting of the cabinet,
a conference between President Wil
son and Chairman Stone of the senate
foreign relations committee, and an
other, day of stirring debate in' the
senate.
Administration leaders firmly out-,
lined in the senate today the position
of the government in the face of de
nunciation from the republican side
and another resolution directing in
tervention, proposed by Senator Works
of California. At the state department
officials were awaiting official word
from General Carranza in reply to the
demand made upon him to weed out
and punish the bandit murderers.
While no direct communication from
General Carranza had reached the
state department tonight, a message
from him to Eliseo Arredondo, the
Mexican ambassador designate, an
nounced the dispatch of troops to cap
ture the outlaws and his purpose to
visit "condign punishment upon every
participant in the massacre."
This message was regarded at the
state department as an indication of
the character of the formal reply to
Secretary Lansing's representations,
which is expected not later than to
morrow. The Mexican embassy was without
other dispatches regarding the bandit
hunt.
General Obregon was said to be at
Queretaro, where he haff been sum
moned for a general conference, and
it was regarded as likely that he would
remain there, the work of running
down the Villa forces about Chihuahua
being left in the hands of Generals Ga
vira and Trevino. '
Measures to facilitate the removal of
Americans from districts where their
lives might be endangered were dis
cussed by department officials with
Mr. Arredondo, who later advised
General Carranza by telegraph that
every assistance be given such Ameri
cans and escorts provided to accom
pany them into cities where strong
garrisons are maintained. He went
further than the state department sug-1
gested, recommending that in cases
where foreigners objected to leaving,
that they be forcibly removed to points
of sAfety.
That large, numbers of Americans
are leaving northern Mexico was re
ported to the department, but it is es
timated that not counting the mem
bers of a Mormon colony at Casas
Grander, there still are at I'arral, Du-
rango, Madera and other points, the
control of which by Carranza is doubt
ful, more than 3,000. That the majori
ty of these may remain in spite of
wa. nings i feared.
When Secretary Lansing was asked
whether the United States government
would protect its citizens under such
circumstances, he replied that it would
do so "to the best of its ability," but
that in such bases the government
would not be obliged "to use force
where people are indiscreet." He com
pared the situation in Mexico with that
ir F,urope at the beginning of the war
when Americans were ordered out.
Debate in the senate brought out
positive declarations from Senator
Stone and Senator Lewis of Illinois
that there would he no countenancing
of the demands of republican leaders
for intervention, and both charged the
republicans with insincerity of purpose

CHIHUAHUA CITY", Chi., Mex.,
Jan. 14. General Francisco Villa has
but forty men with him in the Guerre
ro district according to General Tre
vino, commander of the northeastern
corps of the Carranza army. This in
formation was given out in an inter

Lieutenant Colonel Xevarrez, a Villa

last Monday, was being brought to the

There was no truth in El Paso re

EL PASO, Texas, Jan. 14. Fifty
two Americans, including a number
of women and children, arrived here
tonight at 7:15 o'clock from Chi
huahua City, the region where al
leged Villa bandits slaughtered 18
foreigners last Monday.
More than l.'O Americans still re
main in what is considered the
danger zone.
The latter, it was hoped, would
reach American territory aboard a
special train Monday on a train
sent from El Paso last night, and
which according to advices received
by United States officials arrived at
Parral tonight. The refugees who
arrived tonight said the special train
passed through Chihuahua City this
morning.
"Oh, it's good to get home," said
a number of refugees as the train
crossed the Rio Grande, into Amer
ican territory.
The train bearing the refugees al
so brought two American soldiers
who were picked up in uniform by
members of the Carranza train
guard, 18 miles south of the border.
General Gabriel Gavira, commandant
at Juarez, said he would turn the
soldiers over to an American officer
tomorrow. They disappeared last
Sunday and tonight could say only
that they did not know how they
gpt into Mexico, where United States
soldiers, in or without uniforms are
not permitted to go at any time.
It was long past dark when the
refugee train with its guard of
more than 100 Carranza soldiers
from Chihuahua, drew into Juarez.
The coaches were lighted by candles
stuck on the backs of the wooden
seats. Through the partly opened
windows wafted the odor of tor
tillas and enchiladas, cooking on the
sheet iron stoves of the Juarez sta
tion peddlers, and the savory odors
seemed to whet the appetites of
those refugees and who were not too
tired to eat.
The train was met by a party
which include General Gavira, the
Juarez commandant, Andreas G. Gar
cia, Carranza consul at El Paso, and
Z. L. Cobb, collector of the port of
El Paso. Mr. Cobb quickly passed
the entire party and immigration of
ficials consumed little time in
searching for contraband before per
mitting the train to proceed this
side of the boundary.
Once again on American soil, the
refugees were whisked into motor
cars by waiting friends and the ma
jority of them hurried to bed.
All the employes of the American
Smelting and Refining Company
from the Chihuahua Smelter and the
employes of the El Potosi Company,
came on the train, as well as a score'
of men, women and children, foreign
residents of Chihuahua City.
The scarcity of troops at the Chi
huahua state capital was confirmed
by arrivals who said that two hun
dred and fifty men was about thev
total of the Carranza forces there.
On January 10, the day of the re
ported battle at Escalon, between the
forces of Argumedo and the Carran
za troops from Chihuahua City, it
was reported, troops had moved out
of the capital to the south.
American Consul Thomas D. Ed
wards of Juarez made representa
tions today to General Gavira, com
mandant at Juarez, to the effect that
