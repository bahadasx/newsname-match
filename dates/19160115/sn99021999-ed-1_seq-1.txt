LONDON. Jan. 14. It ia authorltaUrely
announced today that the reported of
fensive of the Teutonic allies In Greece
did not occur. The rumor that the at
tack had begun against the force of the
allies, apparently originated in the
activity of the French In blowing up the
bridge connecting Balonlkl with the road
over which the attacker would normally
travel. Rrldge were destroyed by the
Krenoh not only at Pemir Hisaar, on the
Struma, near Berres, but also at Klllndtr.
south of Dolran. All the bridge de
stroyed were In Greek territory.

negro have suspended hoatlllties for the
purpose of discussing arrangement
whereby further warfare on Montenegrin

Imply on the fsct that the Austrian ad
vance In Montenegro ha becom so slow

It Is observed that both altiea are un

information on the military activities In
that region, but beyond a general review
of the Russian offensive movement It
give tody but little light on the hap
