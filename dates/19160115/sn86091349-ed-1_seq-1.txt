Novada has long been considered Claud Atchl3Dn.and Laniond Woods
a land of wonderful opportunities. It came over from Barclay Monday re
has a long list of Infant industries turning the next day.
which, in time, are boiyid to develor
into full grown ones. The latest to
demand attention is commer.cializinp
ashes from sage brush. Heretofore
fa diets who have cleared off th
uesext acres have labored under the
assumption that the ashes were
.worUiess and that the burning of
U-jj brush from the land has niaci
legitimate bill of expense
retailing the soil for the planting
of grains.
Now it is c'almed that the
sage brush ashes contain potash ir
commercial quantity and that the
are. really worth mone This fact
has recently come to light and only
al few days ago M. L. Lee, cashiei
of the Bank of Pioche received a
letter from a chemical manufactur
ing company operating at Richmond
"Va:, offering him $100 per ton. f
a b. Pioche for all the sage brusi
ash sent during the next half year.
The product is to be placed in sacks
far shipment.
It appears that experiments made
recently at the University of Nevada
devolved the fadt that the asher
f.om southern Nevada sage brush
contain a sufficient amount of
potash to make it worth while
These experiments were conducted
by Prof. Romanzo Adams and i1
'was through him that the Virgin
ia chemical company was placed in
touch with Mr. Lee and a bonl
tied oiU'er of $100 per ton made (or
the product. It is claimed that sam
Piss of the ashes sent to the labra
tory of (the chemical company
K CMitaiinetd a base of 31 per cent ji'
soluable potash and it is here that
the prospect of launching a new in
dustry In this Btate becomes interest
ing. From parties who have read up
on the subject it has been learned
that! the extraction of potash from
desert growths is not new; that i'
is now being practised .in. .Austral
" lia with a' considerable degree of sue
cess. Authorities on the subject as
sert that the burning of sage brush
will produce an ash product of from
6 to 10 per cent; hence, based on
tlh lower figure, one ton of crud
sage brush would burn to 160
pounds of ash, and this product be
ing worth 5 cents jer pound wou
j;ive, la returh of $8, out of which
wowld have to come the expense of
cutting and burning the brush, sack
ing the product and delivery to the
railroad station.
It Is surprising, to say the least
t3 learn that plain Bage brush, which
travelers over the desert have been
ajccustomed to using for fire wood
Is actually valued at $8 per ton and
tie ashes therefrom. 100 per t n
and a 40-ton car load $4,000.
Itl would appear from the forego
ing figures that good money can
Jbe made in tihls brush burning eu
terprise, if the undertaking wer
gone at systematically. It would bf
especially profitable to persons wh.
might have a large area of sage lan.
to clear for themselves for it is safe
to say that the cost of improvement
could; be morel than met In commer
cializing the ashes retained after
burning the brush.
JURY IN

The jury that heard the case of
tho state of t.t.da against W. W.

foj 20 hours, reported to Judge J.
Emmet Walsh of the Nye county
District Court that it was hopeless

tal. Jfadge Walsh ordered the Jury
discharged and directed that s the
sVond suit against Mr. Booth bc(
set for trial. This second suit has
as presecutlng witness District At
torney J. A. Sanders.
The complaint charges the defend
ant wltfi the crime of criminal libel.
The case grows out of the publication
f an article In the Bonanza of No

plaining witness is charged with the
crime of taking and accepting"grease'
meaning money as a bribe in the
passing and promulgation of an oddi

GRUBSTAKING PROSPECTOR
IS STRONGLY ADVISED
In the early days the men bunched
together and sent out prespectors,
of late the prospector has become
an almost unknown quantity, partly
because silver mines have lost much
of their charm, and second, because
it is so hard! lor a poor man to clins
io a prospect ana keeD htH tm
good until it is enough developed to
attract attention.
But when the prospector quits
then mining is generally limited to
what has already been discovered
and the best mines are worked out
after a while.
In the old days when the boys
putf up" for a prospector they calk
ed it gambling and were prepared in
advance to lose philosophically.
That gambling, or some other
plan will have to be resorted to, or
mines will become .scarce after
few years more. Goodwin's Weekly

PRODUCTION OF SILVER
Nevada produced more silver than
anyi other state In the union last
year, with 13,793,000 fine ounces to
Iter credit according to official fed
eral figures.
Nevada was fourth on the list of
gold rpoducers. the output totaling
11,314,700... t
California led in the country's
gold production with a value of $23,
005,800. Colorado was second with
$2191,200, and Alaska third with
$16,626,700.
Montana was second to Nevada as
regards sliver bullion, with 12,690,
200 fine ounces, and Utah third with
11,168,500 to her credit. Idaho was
fourth with 10,595,300.
Nevada's Metal Output
Nevada's output of all metals was
18 er cent higher in 1915 than in

Sam Piatt Comments
On Morcross' Candidacy
Sam Piatt, the republican noiniiif-o
for the United States senate, against
senator Francis G. Newlands at the
last election, was interviewedfctoday
concerning the announcement 'Iff J Jus
tioe Norcross and made the,"( follow
ing statement, to the' Reno gazette:
"Probably no man in 'public life in
the scate today has more greatly dis
tinguished himself than Justice Frank
H. Norcross. He has always proven
himself an able, conscientious and
fear ess official and the announce
ment of ..his- candidacy for the Unifc-f
ed States senate undoubtedly holds
marked interest among Republi
cans bf ' Nevada and the electorate
o the entire state. On account of
the undoubted zealous par;y fight
that will be waged during the next
campaign it is well that a numbec
of active candidates from both par
ties enter the list, for the oppor
tunities for selecting the strongest!
nominee will be all the greater.
'Owing to the very close margirl
between Senator Newlands and my
self at the lastl election, many of my
friends have assumed that I shall
again be a candite this year. It is
more than likely that I shall be. It
is most gratifying to have this op
portunity to express publicly my un
bounded gratitude to the large num
ber of voters who supported me at
the last election. No man ever entei
dd a senatorial fight in th's state
who had behind him a more loyal
following or a greater number of
zealous and enthusiastic workers and
no feeble words of mine can proper
ly express my heartfelt thanks, to
each and all of them..
"Whoever the nominee of ihe next
Republican convention for this great
office may be, I am certain he will
lead the party to victory. The signs
of the times cannst be mistaken. Na
tionally and.locallly the needs of the
country and state demand principles
and policies that, will foster and en
courage American , nad state indus
tries' and build up fos the welfare1
and prosperity cf our people."
DEMOCRATS ARE URGING

SLAUGHTER OF
COYOTES IN HUMBOLDT
That a big slaughtering of coyotes
and wildcats is being accomplished
by tihe many hunters and trappers
that are out is shown in the Sheriffs
report for the month of December,
when; 1,518 scalps of these animals
were receievd at his office. I
The following shows the number of
noxious animals killed and the num
ber of scalps presented at the differ
ent towns
Winnemucca, 41.' cats and 528 coy
otes;- Lovelok, 12 cats and 225 coy
otes; Golconda 31 cats and 360 coy
otes; Paradise, 20 cats and 167 coy
otes; Sulphur, 4 cats and 57 coyotes
Denio, 16 cats and 16 coyotes; Imlay
1 cat and 14 coyotes.SThese figures
give a total of 12.9 wildcats and 1,389
coyotes killed. The total amount of
bounties to be paid Is $3,036.
This report is exclusive of the many
coyotes and other noxious animals
tha,t are being killed by the larg
force of government men in the field
No bounties are paid on these animal
killed by government hunters.
The bounty on coyotes was increas
't to $2 per head by the commis
sioners at their November meetinr.
The increase went into effeSct the 1st.
day of December and the bounty pay
ments for he month are over $3,000.
Other counties have not increased tli
bounty on coyotes and it is very prob
able that fiealps of animals killed in
other' places have been brought! n-
I to this county and the increased
bounty fraudulently collected.
Thd hucrease was made for only:
one month. December. It will not be
in effect this month unless the ordi
nance is re-enacted. Unless a like
raise is made by other counties mak
ing the cloyote bounty uniform, it
would be foolish for Humboldt to
