PROF. I. W. DUNHAM
18271915
Years are indeed but as yesterday
when past.
.The recent death cf this revered
uncle, recalls scenes of my' childbed
and the early influences which helped
form character and 'which' impressed
upon the minds of irty youthful asso
ciates the value of un education in
the iRenniuqton graded school.
For eleven years Prof. I. W; Dun
bam rendered faithful' and etflcietit
service as superintendent of . this
ccdiooi. " V
His characteristic was firmness;
strict, sometimes severe, but I be
lieve, always just.
With ceaseless patience he took
note of every short-coming of those
under him, often calling offenders
away, to be privately reasoned with
ami reproved. '
Who can forget his summons to
"the office," where many wer made
to feel the weight of his displeasure?
Yet, those then under his charge in
the school rooms have lived to assert,
that Prof. Dunham was ono of the
best friends of their youth.
In trouble he was ever a sympathiz
ing friend and his generous spirit
actuated many deeds of helpfulness.
His wife, .Martha Limlley, died
many years ago, after their family re
moval to Schenectady, N.. Y.
In church and social life and in her
home, her sweet, lovable nature lias
never been forg'otten by those who
knew hcv.
Great trials came to them loth in
the unexpected deaths of two little
daughters sorrows borne with Chris
tian fortitude.
In his later years Prof. Dunham
was alllicted with blindness, lie was
tenderly cared for at the home, of his
youngoKt daughter, .Mrs. Sidney lira
man in Hartford, Conn., in which
place his daughter Klizabeth Ay res
and son. How ai d, also live. His daugli
ters Jinnie (Mrs. Tleniscn Duliois)
and Sarah, reside at Hondout, N. Y.
"To live in hearts we leave behind
Is not to die."

FISH AND GAME MEETING
Officers Met in W. H. Wills' Office for
Appointment of Committees.
A meeting of the officers of the Pen
nington County forest, Fish and
Came association for tho purpose of
appointing the committees lor the cn
tuiiig year was held last evening in
W. H. Wills' cilice. The foliowin?
were present X. P. C.reensb t, S. P
Hawks, J. P. Morrlssey, W. H. Wills
Kdward S. Wiggins and Wills T
White. k
The chairman of lour committees
were chosen as follow.?: Finance, G
Phil Kndress; .Membership, S. P.
liawks, Keceivlng of Fish, K. S. Wig
gins; Shelters, X. E. Creenslet. There
arc several other (ominittces connect
ed with the organization but no action
was taken in regard to them as they
are not necessary to the present ac
tivity of the association and they
who left to the organization as a
body to be disposed of later.
liecause of trouble w hich has unsen
in the past over an unwieblly number
of members to each i ommiitee, lho of
ficers tried a new departure in ap
pointing chairmen only and allowing
these to appoint their own assistants
if tin) chairmen need such during the
yea.'.
Another important transaction was
the cuiuelijuion of back dues owed
prior to January 1st. i'A. The oni
ons felt that as there is a sinUl bal
ance already in the treasury the mem
bership committee could get. mure ac
tivity if past accounts were ( barged
off against members and dues paid
promptly from this time forward.
The activities of the association
for the coining year were iiiscu?:o-d
and tho membership lommittee laid
plans to interview every man in Hen
nington County whose al'iliaiion
would be desirable.
A letter was read from John WVTit

With MeaIco Because American
Citizens Were Killed
GIVE mmik FIRST CHANCE
President Feels That If Carranza Acts
Promptly This Country Should
Walt for the Result.
Washington, Jan. 14. Gen. Car
ranza a the do facto government of
Mexico ite to be ftlven full opportu
nity, witdbut intervention rroiu the
United states, to run to earth the
borderers of American citizens at
San'a . Jicl and to demonstrate abil
Illy it ostore order and protect for
I tijn rights in the Southern republic
I Tl :$ was the outstanding fact here
-t, after a meeting of the Cabi-
"t, a conference between President
iVllson and Chairman Stone of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
ami another day of stirring debate in
the Senate chamber.
The President supported by his
Cabinet and the Democratic leaders
in Congress is declared to be deter
mined that the American government
shall not be stampeded by Avar talk
and cries of vengeance into rushing
an army across the Rio Grande to de
stroy in its infancy the do facto gov
ernment which the United States with
the cooperation of Pan-American na
tions aided in establishing after the
.Mexican nation had been torn by
revolution, for years.
In the Senate Administration lead
ers firmly outlined today the. position
of lho Government in tha fact of de
nunciation from tho Republican side
and another resolution directing inter
ventiou proposed by Senator Works
of California. At the State Depart
ment officials were vigilant in their
watch over the situation, awaiting of
ficial word from Gen. Carranza in re
ply to the demand made upon him to
reek out and punish the bandit murderer.-?.
While no direct communication
from Cm. Carranza had reached the
State Department tonight, a message
from him to Klisco Arredondo, tiie
A! xiie.in ambassador designate, an
nounced the disptaeh of troops to cap
ture the outlaws and his purpose to
visit "condign punishment upon every
participant in tiie massacre."
That large number of Americans
ate leaving Northern Alexico was re
pented to the Department but It is es
timated that not counting tho mem
bers of a -Mormon colony at Casas
Grandes there are still at Parrel, Dur
ango, Madera and other points in dis
tricts whose control by Carranza is
doubtful, more than 800. That the
majority of these may remain in
spite of warnings, is feared.
Tho Play.
It is remarkable bow Virtuous and
generously disposed every one is nt a
play. We uniformly applaud what is
right and condemn what Is wrong
vt hen it costs us nothing but the senti
mciit. Ilazlitt.
An Odd Apology.
This is the classic apology of a cele
brated statesman of tho last genera
tion: "Mr. Speaker, in the heat of de

gentleman opposite was a dishonest
and unprincipled adventurer. I have
now. in a calmer moment, to flute
that I 11 111 sorry for it."

CHAUTAUQUA TICKETS
Nearly All Disposed of Summer En
tertainment Prograi".
At a result of the work of Miss
Grace Hershey in the village this
(week, nearly all the tickets necessary
for the success of the Chautauqua
have teen disposed of. There are
still a few remaining that can bo pro
cured by a post card. General Deliv
ery, from Miss Hershey, but the num
bcr is so small that it is practically
certain Chautauqua will come aptin
next summer.
The program this year will be
equally as interesting as that of last
summer It is planned this year to
erect a tent 'which "stays erected '
and that the wind cannot blow down,
as was the unlucky experience last
year. Much of the Chautauqua spirit
is lost when the entertainments have
to bo given indoors.
Among the musical attractions will
be an opera company of 30 peopfe
who -will render either "The Mikado"
or "Tho Chimes of Normandy," and
a quartette Including members of the
Beaton opera company. Either the
Victor Band, which .played here last
season or the Colangelo band will fui
nlsh at least two band concerts an"
a boys' choir, from the St. Paul'f
choir of Drcokllno, Mass, will also be
a feature. For speakers choice will
be made from among Dr. Newell
Dwlght Willis, Dr. Parks Cadmap or
Russell Conwell. Morteville Flowers
a famous orator from the "western cir
cuit is also listed for the eastern cir
cult this year. Ross Crane the plat
form cartoonist will also be a feature
as well as several attractions which
are now being booked.

The Girls' Civio League atfer sever
al years of hard labor has found that.
t loo' Rtrnner enoueh to carry On the
work It has undertaken and steps
were taken Friday evening to enlarge
tho orgai r.ntion to include men as
well as v.x .'
The Civic Lca-me was started by a
small group of ,..la in a modest ef
fort to do someth. .g for the children
of Bennington and indirectly for the
benefit of the community through
aiding tho citizenship of the future.
The work has grown constantly and
the original organization has been
added to somewhat, but practically
the work has been done by a group
of young women. In the opinion of
The Banner and many other folks
tho Civic Dengue has done more ac
tual good in Bennington during tha
past five years than any other one
jaciety or organization. It has done
aiore than the strength of its chief
workers could Ftand.
Last week Mrs. Warwick S. Carpen
tor.: president of the Civic League,
who has been giving the biggest
share of her time to tho work, bo-
came ill from tho effects 'and left
compelled to resign." Miss ' Mathilde''
Vos.-ler, the recreation director, who '
has been working ! hours a day for
several months, found that even her
iWUlln vtJliatllll.lvii Kuuiuii t u , ..
and was abligad to take a vacation.
Tho other young women of the or
ganization didn't feel equal to assum--ing
the wholo burden and asked Dr.
C. F. Stimson of New York, fiold sec-'
retary of tho Playground and Recrea
tion association of America to come .
to Bennington and advise those inter
ested. Dr. Stimson after spending two
days hero met about 50 men and wo
men at the Public library Friday eve
ning and spoko at some length on the
importance of the work and wonder
ful results that are being secured all
over tho country in helping the chil
dren grow up into useful men and wo
men. Dr. Stimson advised a now or
ganization composed of both men and
women so that tha responsibility
would bo more widely distributed and
so much work would not fall on any
one person.
An informal meeting was th'en held
with F. B. Pope as chairman and W.
H. Myers as secretary to make plana
for a permanent organization. After
some discussion a committee of seven
was elected to draft a plan for the
new organization, to enlist members
in it and then call a meeting to com-,
plete the organization and set it to
work. This committee is composed
of Robert E. Wealy, Mrs. W. W,
Burke, Miss Hilda Pratt, Miss Jean
netto Perkins, J. Lawrence" Grlswold
and Frank E. Howe.
Every person in Bpnnington, who
