NEW YORK. January 15.?
The United States submarine ,
E?2 was today blown up and ?
partially destroyed in the New |
York Navy Yard. The body of a
one man killed in the internal ex- .
t v
plosion was recovered, and a re- |
port to Brooklyn police headquar- J
ters said seven others were killed. ,

which was said to have opened up f

the accident occurred. Several ,
rescue parties which undertook to t
enter the submarine were driven
back by heavy gas fumes. s
Several officers who were low- v
ered into the craft were pulled (
out after becoming unconscious. a
The one body recovered was \
fcund near a hatchway.
Hard to Confirm Report.
Newspaper men were barred from the it
>ard. It was with much difficulty that a
the report of the explosion could be d
' onflrmed through yard officials and all t<
details concerning the accident were w
refused. h
It was reported that the engineers in d
he navy yard were testing <>rie of the a
new Edison batteries installed in the
raft at the time of the explosion. _
These batteries were intended to oh- tJ
viate the danger to the crews of sub- v
marines from gas fumes.
Recently submarines o^the "E" class e
were reported to have made successful
trips with the batteries in use. r
Later reports from the navy yard s
were that twelve men had been taken a
out of the hold seriously injured, and a
twenty with lighter injuries. They l'
were removed to the naval hospital in h
the yard. ?
According to the Nary Depart nent.
the submarine was under the command
of Lieut. Charles M. Cook. jr. h
Lieut. Walter F. Haas was the junior
officer. These two were the only officrs
assigned to the submarine. E
The submarine E12 was at the New f
York navy yard having: installed the n
new batteries which Thomas A. Edison
has developed for the United States ?
Navy. She was the first submersible c
bein>; so equipped. f
Ten men were known to be aboard n
the E-2 when the explosion occurred, t
Two injured men have been taken out. e
A preliminary report to the Navy Department
gave these facts and added b
that the cau*se of the explosion was un- b
kn<>wn. The K-2 was in dry dock. t!
Lieut. Cooke is a native of Arkansas,
and was appointed to the Naval Academy r
in June. 1906. He was under submarine ^
instruction ori the tender Tonopah for five v
>ears, until a few months ago. when he t
was assigned to the command of the E-2. li
Lieut. Haas is a native of Rhode Is- n
land, and was appointed to the Naval c
Academy in 1901. He has been attached
to the E-2 since July, 1912
Second Submarine Tragedy. ,
The accident to the E-2 is the second c
submarine tragedy of the American h
navy, which has been notably free from o
losses to its submersibles. q
The first and most serious submarine d
disaster was the loss of the F-4 in v
Honolulu harbor last March, with the r
toss of twenty men?all the ship's s
ompanv. I
A '-orroded battery lining and poor n

German Ambassador Skeptical. i
"[ don't believe it," was the only com- j
lAnt' Count von Bernstorff, the German
mba-ssador. would make concerning the
ispatches. Tn German diplomatic quar- [
irs tlie impression was conveyed that it ^
-as thought possible Capt. von Papen
ad been connected with the published :
ocuments by British agents. It was |
rgued as incredible that von Papen, with
le knowledge that his ship would be
iken into a British port to be searched,
ould have carried any such correspondnce
as mentioned in the press dispatches, :
vep if he possessed it.
At the German embassy it was said
hat the ambassador had paid con- '
iderable money to von Papen as sal- '
ry and for the expense of such work
s he was expected to conduct as miliary
attache. Embassy officials had no
nowledge of his private bank account ;
r of how he disbursed the money. \
Was Given Money by Embassy. ,
It was made clear at the German emassy
today that Capt. von Papen was
n no way responsible to Count von
fernstorff for his expenditures. It was ;
reely admitted that the withdrawn '
lilitarv attache had been given money ,
n various occasions, sometimes beause
of his inability to draw funds 1
or himself from Berlin. When he
leeded funds and could not obtain
hem otherwise he drew them from the
mbassv accounts.
He was not responsible to the emassy
for his expenditures, however, j
elng solely responsible, it was said, to j
he German war office.
Embassy officials seemed inclined to ;
egard the matter as not being serious,
'hey consider that as von Papen whs
withdrawn for his military activities,
he question is at an end. and the pubication
of evidence which might or
light not show what these activities
onsisted of is of little importance.
Interested in Check Stub Date.
As for the alleged payment of $700
o Werner Horn, !t was said at the
mbassy that the money might have
een spent in counsel fees. Embassy
fficials were much interested in the
uestion of whether the check stub was
ated before or after the explosion
ihich blew up the Canadian Pacific
ailway bridge at St. Croix. Me. It was
aid the officials had never heard of
lorn until after his arrest. They still
naintain, however, they did not beieve
the check stub showed any payment
to tforn.
Secretary Lansing allowed it to be- .
ome knov, n toda> that the State De?artinent
would not consider the conents
of tite documents until official
opies had been received from Ainbasador
Page at London The ambassador
ias not yet forwarded any information
>n the subject.
Circumstances of Recall.
When the recall of the two German f
ifficers was asked the German foreign (
iffi?*e was inclined to seek a bill of j
particulars and fount von Bernstorff,
>n the Instructions of his foreign office,
lotlfled Secretary Lansing that Ger- '
nanv would be inclined to contest If
he Pnited States bas^d its request for i
he withdrawals on developments in
he recent trial of the Hamburg-Amei ian
steamship line officials in New
oik for conspiracy to deceive the
rnitf-d States in official records cotiertrd
witii the clearance of ships with
upplies for German commerce raiders
arly in the war.
After some negotiations Secretary '
.aiming replied to the ambassador that
lie request for withdrawal of the ofTiers
was based solely on their military
ml naval activities, which had detroyed
their usefulness jn this coun- 1
ry, and that the I'nited States was
isposed to stand on its diplomatic 1
rerogative of expreasing its view that
ny official attached to any embassy 1
,as persona lion grata.
Evidence Never Disclosed.
Exactly what evidence the State Deiartnient
has of the activities of the
wo German officers never has been dlslosed.
The investigations of the De.artrnent
of Justice have not hecn made
mblic, and the inference in official dries
has been plain that this course was
ollowed because tiie I'nited States was
eluctant to complicate the delicate
late of relations with Germany over
he submarine warfare negotiations by
ny move which might further inflame
lublic opinion in Germany or this counry.

Rather a Loss of Prestige.
Possibly it would be more 'correct
say that there has been a loss of 1
President's prestige rather than an e
in his popularity. The cause is on ev?
Dne's tongue. It is his failure to cont

GOVERNMENT
OWNERSHIP
LIKELY TO BE COVERED
Authorizes Expenditure v of .$25,000
to Pay Cost of Proposed
Investigation.
In ordering the report on the Newlands
joint resolution for the investigation
by a congressional committee ol
matters pertaining to the regulation ol
interstate and foreign commerce, the
Senate interstate commerce committee
amended the resolution so as to make
more specific the line which the investigation
is to take, provided the resolution
is adopted by the Senate anc
I louse.
Change in the Language.
The committee inserted the following
language In place of the more genera
terms of the original resolution "To investigate
the subject of the government
control and regulation of interstate
and foreign, transportation, th?
efficiency of the existing system in protecting
the right of shippers and carriers
and In promoting the public interest,
the incorporation or control ol
the incorporation of carriers and al
proposed changes in the organizatior
of the interstate commerce commission
and the act to regulate commerce."
Tt was said today that the investigation,
if undertaken, will be the broadest
and most searching ever undertak
en into transportation systems and
methods in this country. That it will
cover the question of government ownership
of railroads also was intimated
$25,000 to Pay Expenses.
The committee also placed an amendment
in the resolution specifically
authorizing the expenditure of $25,00C
to be used in making the investigation.
The proposed investigation is in line
with the recommendations contained in
the President's message to Congress
last December, and it is believed that
it will be approved by Congress.
The proposed committee is to consist
of five members of the Senate committee
on interstate commerce and five
members of the House committee on
interstate and foreign commerce.

A CHANCE FOR CARRANZA

FEAR FOR OTHER AMERICANS

Efforts to Get Them
Out of the Danger
Zone.
Senator Stone, chairman oi the
foreign relations committee of the
Senate, conferred with the Secretary
of State. Mr. Lansing, at the
Department today, in regard to
the Mexican situation. He urged
Mr. Lansing to keep the Senate
informed in regard to Mexican
developments and also to forward
as quickly as possible to the Senate
the report requested in the
resolution offered by Senator Fall
and adopted by the Senate, asking
for the reasons why the administration
had recognized the
Carranza government.
He told Mr. Lansing that he
desired to get the nomination of
H. P. Fletcher as ambassador to
Mexico before the committee for
action as soon as possible, and
until this report had been made
it could not well be done.
Lull in the Excitement.
There was a lull today in the cxc^ment
over the Mexican Uuation which
has swept the Senate thfrnast few days.
An adjournment o# tlie Senate until
Monday at noon was taken last night.
While the democratic leaders today
insisted that there would be no action
at present by the Senate^ooking to the
use of armed force in Mexico by the
United States to protect American citizens
there, there was a strong: feeling: *
at the Capitol that should news come
of further slaughter of Americans the
pot would boil over, and affirmative
action of some kind would be demanded
by the Senate.
The democrats in the Senate, beaded
by Senator Stone and Senator l^ewis of
Illinois, have been quick to resent attacks
by the republicans on the administration's
policy toward Mexico, claiming
that the republicans are making ail
outcry for political reasons alone. Nevertheless.
democratic senators are as
indignant as the republicans over the
c ontinued killing of Americans in Mexico.
and many of them have reached
i he conclusion that the United States
will have to act forcibly to protect its
citizens.
"Give Carranza a chance," they urged
today.
May Propose Neutral Zone.
Senator Gore of Oklahoma has in contemplation
the introduction of a resolution
calling upon the President tact
in concert with Uarranza in establishing
a neutral zone along the Mexican
border which shall be policed by
United troops and Carranza
troops fer *he. protection of Americans
and others in that zone. He may introduce
It when the Senate meets Monda>
He said that he believed the United
States was Justified in using force if
necessary to protect American lives in
Mexico.
His colleague. Senator Owen.
pressed bis indignation at Hie slaughter
of Americans and said that he
thought the United States should offer
to bark up Carranza with armed forces
in exterminating the bandits in Mexico.
"I would go even farther titan that,"
said Senator Owen, "and would like t?>
see this country financially aid the Carranza
government at this juncture with
a loan. I expect that Carranza is ha\
ing a hard time raising sufficient
money to keep large enough armies in
the field to pacify the country."
Would Give Carranza Chance.
"I don't like this killing of Americans."
said Senator Tillman of South
Carolina, chairman of the naval affairs
committee, and "while I believe that
there should be no immediate intervention
in Mexico and that Carransa
should be given an opportunity to
show what he can do to punish the
murderers ana protect Americans, if ho
fails some measures must be taken to.
stop the slaughter."
Senator I^ane of Oregon suggested
that the way to solve the difficulty was
to tell Carranza that the United States
was ready to co-operate with hi in to
the extent of sending American troopa
to the country to aid in driving out
the bandits.
"I believe that would be the neigh*
borly thing to do," said Senator bane.
Cjirranza's Beply Awaited.
tien. Carranza's formal reply to representations
from the United States
demanding that he run down and punish
the murderers of American citizens
at Santa Ysabel, still was awaited today,
although indirect assurances had ?
come from him that this would be done.
Through Eliseo Arredondo, the Mexican
ambassador designate, Carranza
announced that he had sent troops (o
capture the outlaws and promised "condign
punishment on every participant."
This was taken by officials it>

reply which was expected today.
There were no indications toda: of
a charge in the administration's policy

of Mexico a free hand in running
