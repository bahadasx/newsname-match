BELGIAN PRIMATE
Cardinal Mercier Given Tri
umphant Reception in Cap
ital Sees No Sign of
Early Peace.
Rome, Jan. 14, 7:20 p, m. Cardinal
Mercier, primate of Belgium, arrived
in Rome today and was received at
the station by the Belgian ministers
accredited to the Vatican by Sir Henry
Howard, British minister to the vati
cau, Monslgnor Desanpro, papal mas
ter of the chamber, and a large num
ber of residents of the Belgian col-
lony. A large crowd of Italians also
1 greeted the cardinal.
I In the municipal court, Prince Co
lonna, mayor of Rome and several
members of the council, welcomed the
ai rival of Cardinal Mercier in Rome
and greeted him as "the man repre
senting tho tragic and heroic history
of civic virtue of unshakable faith "
The speakers also expressed sym
pathy with Belgium, "momentarily
crushed" and admiration for the Bel
gian arm j', the Belgian people and
fcr King Albert and tho Belgian
queen.
"What I have done was simply my
duly," Cardinal Mercier told the As
sociated Press correspondent tonight
while the people of Rome, comprising
all classes, received him in a trium
phant manner such as the cardinal of
no other nation has enjoyed on en
tering Rome since the fall of tempor
al power.
Cardinal Mercier Is specially smil
ing and pleasant in manner. He in
tends to remain in Rome for a fort
night but does not wish to be inter
lewed, or make statements of any
kind to the press, not because ho
gave any official promise In this re
gard to the German authorities, but
because he cousiders that he is bound
In honor to keep silent In spite of
this, he spoke in high praise of the
American generosity in helping tho
destitute Belgians and of the immense
debt of gratitude felt by his 'people
toward America, adding "the Belgians
feel very much their humiliating posi
tion, but they need to accept char
ity." The situation of the unfortunate
nation, the cardinal explained, is not
as terrible now as immediately after
its occupation.
When asked for his opinion on the
probable end of the war, Cardinal
Morcler raised his arms and lifting
his eyes to Heaven he exclaimed:
"Long yet, perhaps this time next

STATESMEN GIVE
VIEWS ON MEXICO
Something Must Be Done to
End This Carnival of
Crime.
"Washington, Janv 14. Speaker
Champ Clark said today:
"There is nothing to be said about
tho Mexican situation except that the
United States ought to compel those
people down there to respect Amer
ican rights, both of persons and prop
erty." Other members of congress express
ed their viows on Mexico as follows:
Representative Scott Ferris of Ok

M. Skouloudis, the new premier of

Representative John E- Baker of

Representative Benjamin K. Focht
of Pennsylvania, Republican:
"This country must go into Mexico,
prepared to stay there, ready to ex
tend the freedom and advantages of
modern American civilization to the
down-trodden people of that republic.
The southern limit of the United
States should be extended to the Pan

Rppresentative Fred Brltton of Il

" would favor advancing Carranza
any reasonable sum up to $20,000,000
with which to pay his troops and po
lice, as wefl as to purchaso munitions.
I would even go so far as to assign
our military officers to assist Mexi
can soldiers in bringing about a state
of peace in that country, though I
would oppose sending our soldiers in
to Mexico for this policing duty. In
exchange for our gold and munitions,
I would negotiate a treaty with Car

wonderful opportunity for a naval

Edison s Invention Cause
of Latest Disaster
in Navy.
New York, Jan. 15. An explosion
aboard the submarine E-2. in dry dock
at the New York navy yard, caused
the death today of at least threo mem
bers of the crew and injured a num
ber of others, variously reported at
from six to twenty. Ono was killed
outright and two died later at the
naval hospital at the navy yard.
Those seriously injured were taken
to the hospital shortly after the ex
plosion occurred, at about 1'45 o'clock
p. m.. At 3 p. m. others rescued from
the interior of the submarine were
brought in
The explosion was said to be due to
hydrogen gas ignited while the new
batteries, invented by Thomas A. Edi
son, were being recharged.
Neiwspapermen were barred from
the navy yard and authentic details
could not be obtained during the first
two hours following the explosion
Some reports had it that ten men
were in the submarine at the time,
and that eight or nine were instantly
killed.
Several officers who attempted to
enter the submarine at the head of a
rescue party were driven back by the
fumes and it was reported at 3 p. m
that a number of ibodies were still in
the interior.
Four of the injured who were re
moved to tho naval hospital just out
sidt the yard Wjre thought" by sur
geons to have little chance for re
covery. They were L. C. Miles, chief
electrician of Brooklyn; John Holsey,
seaman, Baltimore; Guy H. Clark, Jr.,
Frankfort, N. Y., and Raymond Otto,
Mlddleburg, N. D.
Rear Admiral Nathaniel R. Usher,
commandant of the navy yard, was
listening to Secretary Daniels' speech
on preparedness at the Democratic
cluib here when he was informed of
the explosion. Tho commandant ac
companied by an aide of Secretary
Daniels at once went to the navy yard
and told newspapermen he would
make an Immediate investigation.
Washington, Jan. 15. Official re
ports to the navy department say
three men were killed and eleven in
jured in the explosion on the sub
marine E-2 today at the Now York
navy yard.
Rear Admiral Usher, commandant
of the yard, made only a brief report
giving the number of dead and in
jured and added that the latter were
badly burned.
Officers of the E-2 were Lieutenant
Charles M. Cook, Jr., of Arkansas, and
Lieutenant Haas of New Jersey. Cook
served five years on tho submarine
tender ship Tonopah in preparation to
i taking command of tho E-2, and Haas
Joined the boat a few months after
she was ocmmlssionad.
Navy officers familiar with subma
rine construction said it was difficult
to imagine to what the accident was
due, if It was not a battery explo
sion. The new battery was developed by
Thomas A. Edison some time ago to
obviate the danger to submarine
crews from that source and was tested
for months at the New York yard
before It was decided to Install one
for trial on each of the E boats and
also one on one of the L boats now
under construction.
Representatives of the Edison com
pany recently asked that ibetter venti
lation be provided for the E boats,
not In order to avoid any anticipated
danger of explosion, they said, but to
provide for greater efficiency of the
battery, and steps were taken in that
direction.
The submarine E-2 was built in
1910 and displaced 430 tons. She was
capable of traveling 14 knots on the
surface and 11 knots submerged. In
September. 1911, she had a narrow
escape from an accident similar to
that which befell the F-4 outside of
Honolulu harbor. While tho submers
ible was engaged in maneuvers off
Brontou reef lightship, Ensign Gillam
detected chloric gas when the vessel
was submerged fifty feet. Ho ran to
the surfaco and the conning tower
was quickly opened to give the crew
fresh air. Every one of the 19 mem
bers of the crew", it is said, were more
or less affected by the gas, some
bleeding from the nose and mouth.
As a result of the accident, Ensign
Gillam was under medical treatment
nt tho naval hospital in Las Animas,
Colorado, for several months.
Tho E-2 was the only vessel in the
world equipped with the Edison
nickeled batteries and she mado her
first trip successfully with them De
cember 7, last. With "Lieutenant Chas.
M. Cook, Jr., the E-2 made an cxten
sivo run on the surface, then dived
and maneuvered for several hours.
Aftor these experiences tho E-2 made
a srucce3sful run submerged. The run
proved, It was declared on excellent
I authority, that tho new batteries gave
better speed with less fuel.
The E-2 with her sister ship, E-l,
were tho first two naval vessels to bo
equipped, with th,e Diesel oil-burning,
Interior-combustion engines and they
wore the first submarines to be
equipped with wireless telegraph apparatus.
FLOODS CAUSING
GREAT DISTRESS
Dikes of Holland Collapse in
Several Places and People
Continue to Flee Before
Rising Waters.
London, Jan. 15, 10:50 a. m. The
damage caused by the flood in north
ern Holland is said by Reuter's Am
sterdam correspondent to be greater
than was developed at first. The great
dikes along the Zuyder Zee collapsed
at several places. Peasants, with
their cattle, fled precipitately before
the rising waters.
Near Muiden the dike broke at sev
eral points before the people realized
the danger The waters of the Zuy
der Zee rushed through the gaps with
such force as to wash away large
sections of the road which runs along
the dike.
From all north Holland come re
ports of distress caused by the flod.
Considerable damage was done at Vol
endam and Edam in Texel and Mark
en islands, and in the province of
Groningen.

follow students, which is almost pro
verbial. The South Cache boys, though out
classed, showed considerable promise,
their principal stumbling blocks be
ing a lack of experience and unfamil
iarity with the floor. Anderson, the
right forward was one of the stars
of the game, taking most of the
chances that came his way and scor
ing several remarkably difficult bas
kets. He needs practice, however, on
throwing from the foul line.
Weber's, point of criticism was that
of fouling, a' condition that'sliould be
remedied. Wilkinson, Nixon and
Brewer played fast and consistently,
showing fine- skill at dodging and
busket throwing. The first mention
ed is a bit too rough at times but,
barring this, should easily qualify for
an all-state position. His playing of
the two Richmond guards last night
was one of the most interesting fea
tures of the contest.
The game was unusually free from
long delays, being started only ten
minutes after the scheduled hour and
completed in 70 minutes. An appre
ciated external feature was the mark
ing up of the score as the contest pro
gressed, for the benefit of the fans.
