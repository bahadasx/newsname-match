BAPTIST? LONG ISLAND HISTORY
The Western Hecorder, a local
Baptist paper, which has for its
editorial staff the Kov. J. W. Porter,
D. D., LL. D., as editor, and E. C.
C. Stevens, who can not even boast
of a single "D," as associate editor,
Is noted for its continued attacks on
Catholicity and Catholics in general,
the latest being on those who took
part in the Latin American Mission
ary Conference and did not sanction
the sending of proselyters to South
America, where the people are nearly
all Roman Catholics. After abusing
other Protestant ministers for even
conceding the right for Catholics to
bo classed as Christians, the bigoted
editor of the Recorder says:
"It is refreshing and heartening
that the Central Committee, com
posed of ecclesiastical mugwumps
and religious mollycoddles, have
been checked in their accursed con
spiracy to court Papal favor at the
expense of the faith onco for all
delivered to the saints. Think of
It! Baptists planning with Roman
Catholics concerning Christian work,
while Baptist missionaries are there
for the specific purpose of destroy
ing the work of Roman Catholics. No
Baptist could enter such a spiritual
pow-wow without raising a question
concerning his sanity or his morals.
And this leads us to remark that
there Is no mission fostered by
Southern Baptists that Is moro fruit
ful and promising than our work in
South America. Their prosperity,
under God, Is no doubt due in large
measuro to the fact that they have
been content to mind their own busi
ness, which with all their heart they
believe to be the Lord's work. Hav
ing done all, may they stand?"
.. NotIco the reference to what is
- -termed the fruitf uKwork of Bap-,
tists in South America, whose peo
ple the Baptist editor delights to
slander desplto the fact that prom
inent leadors in all walks of life are
now advocating Pan-American alli
ances and more intimate relations
with the people of South America,
whom they have found to bo edu
cated and-possessing business ability
of a high degree. Yet the Baptist
editor speaks specifically of destroy
ing the work of Roman Catholics.
It is remarked in an old proverb
that ono must clean in front of his
own door before transferring opera
tions to his neighbor's, and it ap
pears this should hold good In the
case of this Baptist dlvlno. Sorry
to say that the greatest proportion
of illiteracy and Ignorance Is in the
South and principally in the States
where the Baptists control and
predominate. In Georgia, for in
stance, where thero Is an abundance
of child labor and illiteracy, the
Baptists, according to tho last Gov
ernment religious census, numbered
596,319 out of a total of 1,029,037,
or in other words 57.9 per cent, of
all communicants. In tho samo cen
sus tho Catholic figures showed
19,273, or only 1.9 per cent, of the
total. This like proportion appears
in the other States where tho Bap
tlpts hold full sway South Carolina,
Alabama, Mississippi, North Carolina
and Virginia. This would indicate
that tho abovo Baptist writer has
quito a field in tho South for mis
sionary work before attacking the
people of South America.
The Western Recorder is also fond
of telling of the intolerance of Cath
olics and cites Instances of the Mid
dlo Ages for proof, yet tho following
taken from tho Detroit Free Press
in its report of tho Now York Bap
tist convention shows that tho Bap
tists have cause for grievance, right
hero in this country and not as far
back as the Mlddlo Ages. Edwin B.
Richmond, tho Executive Secretary,
roviewed tho history of the Baptist
church on Long Island, as follows:
"Meeting as wo are for our 108th
anniversary in Brooklyn, famed as
tho City of Churches, and upon
populous and historic Long Island,
one is tempted to strike tho historic
chord. The ground upon which" wo
stand is sacred, for it marks the be
ginnings of Baptist effort and or
ganization in the State of Now York.
These beginnings go back to tho very
early history of our country, for
long before thero was a Baptist
church established in tho Empire
State there wero groups of men and
women upon Long Island who were
called Baptists. We have tho testi
mony of the first Catholic missionary
to New York that prior to 1642
thero were in Manhattan and its
environs Anabaptists, here called
"Mutates. As early as 1657 the two
famous pastors of tho first Christian
church established In Now Nether
lands, .now New York, the Dutch
Reformed, complained that one Will
iam Wickendam, a cobbler from
Rhode Island, had come to Flushing,
L. I., proclaiming his call to preach
the word of God, that he had made
disciples, and that in teaching: his
disciples to observe all things com
mand's he had taken them out into
tits Bast river and baptized them by
dlpplmr. Stub a grave breach of
orthodoxy would not oe tolerated
-van by the Dutch of that day and
so Brother Wickendam was fined
100 and ordered to bo banished.
Because of poverty the fine was re
mitted, but tho gentle order of ban
ishment was proceeded with.
"In 1C38 Hansferd Knollys, tho
godly and scholarly, who had been
a clergyman of the Church of Eng
lnnd, found himself in Boston, Mass.,
a fugitive from his native land. He
settled at Dover, N. H., where ho
organized a Congregational church,
but the spirit of Investigation being
at work in his mind ho soon became
a Baptist, and many of his congrega
tion going with him he organized
tho Dover Baptist church, quite
likely the third oldest Baptist cjiurch
in America. About that timo the
Puritan Fathers of Massachusetts
Indulged in n little persecution on
their own account, and Hansferd
Knollys and his people wero the first
to feel it. Accordingly Knollys in
1C41 organized a Baptist colony
and sent It to a previously purchased
plantation upon Long Island.
"The Baptist colony was tolerated
upon Long Island under tho Dutch
rule, but tho British coming into
power it became intolornnt, so the
members thereof quietly folded their
tents and stole away to New Jersey,
where upon the banks of the Raritau
river they bulldod for thomselvos
homes and organized Baptist
churches which remain to this day.
In 1632 Sir Henry Moody, Baronet
of Garesden In Wiltshire, England,
died. His widow, Lady Moody, be
coming somewhat aggressive In her
theological thinking, and especially
so as to her ecclesiastical relation
ship, found the atmosphere of old
England too warm, nnd with visions
of Now England's 'rock bound
coast,' behind which was 'freedom
to worship God,' before her, she sold
her estate and with her minor son
embarked thither. When in Massa
chusetts Lady Moody went the wholo
length and became a Baptist and,
not content with that, she became
actfve and alert in starting a little
propaganda that perchance sno
might help others Into her newly
found and Joyous light.
"Tho Puritan Fathers could not
brook such conduct as that, and so
Lady Moody again sought an asylum
of liberty. This time, In 1843, she
with some others, who were inrested
with Anabaptism, found It under
the Dutch upon Long Island.

FATHER RILEY
Completes Twenty-Five Years of
Service in the Catholic
Priesthood.
Catholicsand Non-Catholics Join
in Celebration of His
Jubilee.
Religious Services and Banquet
Kqual to Any Ever Held in
Kentucky.
GOV, STANLEY WAS TOASTMASTER
With impressive religious serv
ices, beginning Sunday, with a
grand banquet Monday night, and
ending with a high mass and din
ner for tho Bishop and clergy on
Tuesday, the Rev. Father John H.
Riley, the zealous and popular
pastor of tho Church of the An
nunciation at Shelbyvllle, celebrated
tho twenty-fifth anniversary of his
ordination to the priesthood and tho
tenth of his pastorate at Shelbyvllle.
Father Riley was ordained to the
priesthood by the Right Rev. Will
lam Georgo McCloskey, D. D
Bishop of Louisville, at tho Cathe
dral of the Assumption In Louisville
on January 11, 1891, and was sta
tioned there until the following
June, when he' was assigned to
work In Daviess county. For tho
nine succeeding years he was tho
chaplain at tho mother house of
the Sisters of Loretto, in Marion
county, and was transferred to
Shelbyvllle In 1906.
Tho jubilee celebration, which
continued three days, opened Sun
day morning and was in many re
flects the most remarkable event
In tho history of Shelbyvllle. Its
outstanding feature was tho signifi
cant .fact that there ' were men of
all creeds and ovory walk and call
ing In life, from tho distinguished
Governor of the Commonwealth
down to its humblest citizens, gath
ered together spontaneously to pay
a tribute to ono whoso sole claim to
consideration is that as a man and
a priest he has measured up to tho
standard which all men reverence
but few attain.
Sunday morning the church was
thronged with people. Catholic and
non-Catholic, and again in the even
ing at tne impressive closing or tho
first "day," 'whcnFathci'Rileywas
presented with a purse of $800.
Charles Connell made tho presenta
tion for tho parish and Father
Riley, after feelingly expressing his
thanks, made a gift of the money
to the fund which the congregation
has been raising for improvements.
This part of tho evening service at
the church was prefaced by an elab
orate muslca programme and speak
ing. Miss Ethel Delss spoke In be
half of tho young women of tho
parish; William Shinnick for tho
young men, and M. O'Sullvan for
the older members. Visiting
priests were present, among them
tho Rev. Patrick Walsh, of tho
Church of the Sacred Heart, Louis
ville: the Rev. Francis O'Connor.
assistant pastor of tho Cathedral,
L.OU1SV1H0, ana tho Jtov. Father
Robert, of St. Molnrad's Abbey, St.
Melnrad, Ind.
Monday morning there was a sol
emn high mass for the deceased
members of the congregation, fol
lowed by the banquet at night at
tho Athjetlc Club, at which Gov.
Stanley presided as toastmastor.
Gov. Stanley was seated In tho cen
ter of tho speakers' table on a
raised platform, with his venerablo
father, tho Rev. William Stanley,
at his right and Father Riley at his
left. " The Invocation was made by
the Rev. Father Andrew Spotz, C.
R., Suporlor of St. Mary's College.
The speakers wero Gov. A. O. Stan
ley, toastmaster; the Hon. Harry
E. Schoboith, Georgo S. Chownlng.
Judgo E. H. Davis, Judge R. F.
I'eak. judge Ralph W. Gilbert, Lud
low F. Petty and the Rev. William
Stanley. Father . Riley was elo
quent of his expression of gratitude.
Ho especially thanked Gov. Stanley
for tho honor of his presence and
his commendation, but above all he
expressed his appreciation of the
"boys behind this push" and to the
mon of tho community who had
given this exhibition of fraternal
feeling, to all of whom ho gave a
hearty "God bless you" in con
clusion.
The celebration closed Tuesday
morning with impressive services at
the Church of tho Annunciation,
which was again crowded to the
doors. Tho celebrant of the solemn
mass was Father Riley, who was
assisted by the Rev. Patrick Walsh,
pastor or the Church of the Sacred
Heart, Louisville, as deacon; tho
Rev. John T. Hill, pastor of St.
Anne's church, Louisvillo. as sub-
deacon, and the Rev. John D. Kala-
hor, pastor of St. Columba'a church,
Louisville, as master of ceremonies.
Within the sanctuary were tho
Right Rev. DeniB O'Donaghue, D,
D Bishop of Louisville; the Right
Rev. Edmond M. Obrecht, O. C. R.,
Abbot of Gethsemane, and many
priests of the diocese. Immediately
after the gospel of the day the Rev.
Dr. George W. Schuhmann, rector
of St. John's church, Louisville, who
Is a close friend of Father Riley,
delivered the sermon. An'elaborate
musical programme was given by a
full choir, the service closing with
the Te Deum. The clergy then re
tired to the rectory, where a sump
tuous dinner was served.
The Kentucky Irish American
Joins with his legion of friends in
extendinr to Father Riley heartfelt
congratulations, and prays that he
may be spared to celebrate his
golden Jubilee.

WILSON
AVill lie Opposed by Roosevelt,
Opinion of United States'
Senator llollls.
Clalmsllc Is tho Only Available
Big Man Republicans Can
Unite On.
Fallacy of Bargaining For Labor
Arote Now Shown in Latest
Row.
EFFECT DIN UNION SECTIONS
United States Senator Henry F.
HolUs, of New Hampshire, pretty
near sums up the political situation
when he stated in an interview tho
other day that "Theodore Roosevelt
will be the nominee of tho Republi
can party and Woodrow Wilson will
be the candidate of the Democratic
party. And Mr. Wilson will bo
elected for three reasons:
"First Because he has kept this
country out of the European con
flict, until It is in a position to
vindicate its own honor on its own
terms and in its own way in tho
comity of nations.
"Second Because we are only in
the first phases of tho war and the
people of the United States will not
change the administration until
that war Is ended and a peace has
been declared in which civilization
may take stock of its assets.
"We are today facing serious is
sues in this country, and I would
not speak on any of them in any
thing but a serious spirit. So I am
saying that Mr. Bryan will nominate
Mr. Wilson for a second term and
that Mr. Wilson will be re-elected
by an overwhelming vote of the
people. We should abandon foolish
talk about there being any 'quar
rol' between President Wilson and
Mr. Bryan. They aro today on
terms of excellent friendship. Of
this I am certain.
"Roosevelt will be the candidate
of the Republican party, because he
Is the only available big man they
have. All talk about Justice
Hughes being persuaded to leave
tho Supremo Court to accept tho
Republican nomination Is vulgar
claptrap. Such a step on the part
of Justice Hughes is unthinkable.
Roosevelt will be tho Republican
candidate and a formidable one at
that.BHtrProsidentsWnOH4wJUbe
re-elected and his secoud termj will
make history for the United States."
This very situation was predicted
in these columns several weeks ago,
and it should be tho hope of every
Democrat that Roosevelt bo given
tho nomination, as Judging from tho
present outlook Wilson could not
defeat Hughes, Taft or any other
equally strong Republican because
of tho administration policy In deal
ing with Great Britain and tho now
confessedly wrong policy In Mexico.
Wilson turned a deaf ear to tho pro
test of Catholics in regard to tho
persecution of priests and the out
rages of nuns by Carranza follow
ers, but tho murder of Americans
by the wholesale as practiced this
week will compel him to act and at
the samo time will prove that his
pet Carranza is a brigand and cut
throat of tho worst typo. Again we
say Roosevelt is tho only man that
Wilson can defeat in a contest be
fore tho people.
Just prior to tho last Stato olec
tion it was charged in tho columns
of tho Kentucky Irish American
that tho Stanley campaign managers
i wero endangering the success of tho
'entire ticket by dickering for tho
bogey vote the so-called labor vote,
tho same to bo handled by labor
acltators who have no following
whatever. Despite this warning
the Campaign Commltteo arranged
l 1
was that union and other working
men throughout the State re
pudiated tho attempt to deliver
their vote. In Muhlenberg county,
where many miners resldo and
which Is normally Republican by a
small majority, Stanley was de
Jeated by over 1,000 votes, while
McCreary only lost it by 161 in
1911. This same ratio applied In
the other districts whore tho In
dorsement of our walking delegato
was sent. Incidentally this same
delegato was delivering speeches for
Grlnstead, the Republican candidate
for Mayor here, a few years ago,
and has drifted back and forth ac
cording to the campaign barrel slzo
or the duplicity of tho campaign
managers. In conclusion, tho latest
row of tho labor politicians Droves
the contention made before tho
election, that in bargaining for tho
labor vote politicians are pursuing
a will o' the wisp.
DENOUNCES CHAIN PRAYER
The Right Rev. Henry Moeller,
Archbishop of Cincinnati, has re
ceived so many complaints from his
flock concerning a chain prayer let
ter that he has issued a special
communication on the subject. The
prayer and the common form of let
ter sent with it, which have been
sent through the mall by thou
sands, follow:
Oh, Lord, I implore thee to bless
all mankind. Bring us to thee.
This prayer is to be sent all over
the world. In ancient days it was
said that all who wrote it would
bo free frohi calamity or misfor
tune and that all who passed it
would mot with some calamity or
misfortune.
Copy it and send it to nine
friends In nine days, and on tho
tenth day you will meet with some
Joy. Don't break tho chain.
"The prayer In itself is good,"
Archbishop Moeller writes. "The
promise, however, which Is held out
that all who recite the prayer nine
times and send it to nine friends
wil in. nine days bo freed from all
calamity Is in itself rank supersti
tion. The samo is to bo said of
tho threat that all those who fall
to say the prayer nine times, etc.,
will meet misfortune. Any one who
recites tho prayer and believes in
the promise, sins against tho First
Commandment of the Decalogue."
It is estimated that in New York
City thousands of the prayers are
in circulation. Inquiry at the of
flco of the United States District At
torney, to which tho .prayer has
beon referred show that there is
no legal way yet devised to punish
its senders.
MENACE ON TRIAL.
Tho trial of tho Menace Is now
going on at Joplln, Mo., in the Fed
eral Court, seven counts being
named in tho indictment of sending
obscene matter through tho malls,
ono being withdrawn by tho Gov
ernment, referring to a book sold
by tho Menace, tho title of which
was "Tho Popo, Chief of Whlto
Slavers and High Priest of In
trigue." Early in the proceedings
Judgo Van Valkenburgh ruled that
tho mere fact that a prospective
juror was a subscriber to the' Men
ace would not disqualify him from
Jury service in the case.
IRELAND ESCAPES.
Tho Irish Nationalists on Tues
day announced abandonment of
their opposition to conscription In
view of tho fact that the bill does
not apply to Ireland, which is
looked upon as leaving that country
neutral.
John E. Redmond, Parliamentary
leader of the Irish party, an
nounced in the House of Communs
that the Nationalists would not
further oppose tho military service
bill. Redmond intervened early in
the debate, having gone direct to
Parliament from a meeting of tho
Irish party. He quickly ranged
himself and his followers once more
on the side of the Government. Red
mond said the Irish Nationalists,
having made their protest against
the military service bill and recog
nizing that the measure had the
support of an overwhelming major
ity of British representatives in the
House, would cast no. further vote
In any form against it. He added
that the majority for the bill in
the vote on first reading, excluding
tho Irish members, was ton to one.
and that under theso circumstances
ho,. and hlstcolleagues could not take
thotresDon8lblHtvl'6f.anvfurUioron

position.
This stirred Sir Edward Carson.
tho Orange leader, who in a fiery
speech declared that Ireland should
be Included in the draft bill. Sir
Edward expressed himself pro
foundly disappointed with tho way
tho Coalition Government has dealt
with tho matter of Ireland.

PASTEUR.
Faith of Great Catholic Scientist
and Lesson Which It
Teaches.
His Germ Theory Means Avert
ing of Millions of Deaths
Yearly.
The Crowning Acliiveinent of
His Numerous Brilliant
Works.
FRANCE NOW CHILDLESS NATION
In tho latest Issue of tho Na
tional Geographic Magazine, in an
article on "The World's Debt to
France." we read the following:
"It was her Pasteur who estab
lished the germ theory of disease
and through whom the wonderful
miracles of saving human life that
have characterized tho past third of
a century have been wrought. Tho
normal death rate of civilized coun
tries before the days of Pastour was
nbout thirty per thousand of pop
ulation. Today it is about fifteen
per thousand In tho moro progres
sive nations. Think what tho saving
of fifteen lives a year for every
thousand of population means when
applied .to half the earth! It means
the averting of 12.000.000 deaths
annually. It means more than
25,000,000 cases of illness avoided.
It means health and happiness in
20,000.000 homes rather than dis
ease and distress. Who can esti
mate the benefits to humanity of tho
wonderful discovery of Pasteur?"
This accomplishment to which
reference is thus made was tho
crowning achievement of tho many
brilliant works of a man who re
ceived more recognition perhaps
than any scientist In his lifetime
over has, and yet who ever found
In his studies and Investigations tho
deep and overwhelming proof of tho
faith that was his. Tho fidelity of
Louis Pasteur to tho Catholio
church and his firm belief In God
wero but strengthened by tho
science Into which he delved.
"The more I know," he declared,
In a phrase which has often been
repeated, "the more nearly is ray
faith that of the Breton peasant.
Could I but know all I would havo
the faith of a Breton peasant
woman."
grottodfcthaU-thOr
Aiass now much is it to bo ro-
countrfc.from
which Pasteur came" has not heeded
tho example of its great son. The
men in control of its destinies havo
systematically set about to destroy
religion. Thlrty-slx years ago ono
of its false leaders pointed to "cleri
calism" as thO enemy to bo crushed,
and a short timo ago, at tho end of
a long sorles of unjust legislative
acts against the church, tho man
who but lately held its chief place
of power proudly declared that "tho
lights had been put out in the
heavens."' In a pamphlet issued
over a year ago by tho Catholic
Truth Society of Ireland tho various
measures passed against religion In
this campaign aro set forth in do
tail. Tho glory of Franco has been her
Catholic past and that which still
romalns of it among tho peasants of
Brittany. This is shown, inad
verently but none the less forcibly,
In another article on "Tho Beauties
of Franco" in the samo magazine
from which quotation has been
made. Her shame has been tho re
jection of her Catholic traditions,
her bitter warfare on tho church,
and tho acceptance of that falso
morality which has stamped her as
the childless nation of Europe. Per
haps in the hour of her pain, defeat
and humiliation sho may finally de
cide to cast aside tho "falso
prophets" who havo misled hor and
to turn once moro to the church for
tho regeneration of her children.
