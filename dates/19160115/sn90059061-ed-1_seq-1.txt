progress they have made in the last year
this state soon will be in the front rank as
a producer of juvenile agriculturists." ac
cording to Prof. R. A. Moore of the Univer
sity of Wisconsin who today finished judg
ing the Boys' exhibits at the First National

way Building, this city. Trophy cup

quality of corn was raised by the boys of
Montana, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, the
Dakotas, Wisconsin and Minnesota for ex
hibition in this show. These "future greats"
in the corn raising field are rapidly putting
the Northwestern States on the map as a
new and wonderful corn belt. "Why, the
corn laid down here for me to judge has
proved the most surprising in quality that
I have examined in the long years of my as
sociation with the grain," said Prof. Moore.
Considering Prof. Moore's great reputation
throughout the United States as a corn
Judge, this statement by him spells the high
est tribute that could be paid to boyhood
effort in this country.

the seven states being confined to the boys
