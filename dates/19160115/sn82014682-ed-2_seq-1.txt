It is reported that at the time of the accident the E-2 was test

were intended to obviate the danger of fumes during the operation

Though the military order barring newspapermen from the New York
yard makes it Impossible to learn the details of the explosion today, U if
known that experiments have been in progress on the E-2 for some tmll
with the new Edison batteries. . ; v . ' rf
Last December 4 the Star-Bulletin printed the news that the Edjfsn
battery was being installed on the E-2 and that Edison had asked the gov
ernment to withhold Judgment until the actual worth of the batteries hid
been proved by use on this craft. The Edison battery Is designed to Xrfee
the submarines from the dangerous chlorine gas. It is also a smaller and
lighter battery than those now in use and its greater capatify was Ex
pected to increase the possible cruising radius of the mbmerstbles.
In view of the disaster to the F-4 and the theories concerning. battery,
explosion, etc., during the months of her salvage and" later, ther experi
ments on the Edison battery have been watched with greater' interest not
only among navy men here but by Honolulu generally. ' . .'-
Edison's labors on the famous battery Included the handllnsr 'of Sj.OOO
experiments, and an expense of $3,000,000, and date back to 1910, when or;i-
cers oi me v. a. navy were oraerea to investigate submarines
their troubles with batteries to the noted Inventor. -
Battery Placed In E-2 Only After -
Exhaustive Tests Indicated Safetv
Last fall a representative of Edison
gave - the first account of the experi
ments with the new submarine, which
are of particular Interest now. In
June, 1914, Edison decided that he
had remedied the flaws in his Inven
tion and entered a test of cells in
which many manufacturers were par
ticipating. This test was carried out
on a special platform In New York
navy yard. ' When the announcement
was made last fall. It was declared
that the Edison battery had been
charged and discharged 500 times, rep
resenting 10 years of active service
on a submarine. V
The following statement, relating
directly to the installing of the Edi
son battery on the F-4, was then
made: i -
"The Navy Department gave us an
order to install a new Edison battery
and the E-2 is now fifteen-sixteenths
