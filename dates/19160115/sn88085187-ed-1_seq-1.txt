MILK CLEANUP SAVES
LIVES OF 50 TACOMA
BABIES IN ONE YEAR
By E. A. Peters
At least SO babies are
rtlve and vigorously crowing
today because The Times
waged unrelenting \\m a
fear ago for a pure milk sup
ply.
Htutlsilt's gathered from
records of the city health de
partment today allowed that
with ili«i rapid Improvement
Of milk In indium during
101H there waa an amazing
decrease In the number of
death* aiming Infant*.
There were 31 par cent lesß
deaths among babies of six
months or younger, in 1915 than
during the 12 months of the pre
ceding year.
During the first six ttioi'ttis of
1914 health records show that ii
babies under blx months of age
died,many of them because of hn
-proper nourishment. There were
83 deaths in the latter hair of
the year.
Great Improvement Made.
Tin- deaths of these 164 infants
occurred before Tacoma's earn-i
palgn against tubercular milk I
~a begun. l Tp to that time the !
public and tlie dairymen had not
been educuted to tlio perils of bo
vine tuberculosis.
Probably not one mother out \
of 20 In Tanomu realized the Ire- ,
mendous risk she was taking j
when she fed bar baby the ordi
- nary class of milk supplied by
dairymen at that time.
R. A. Button, city milk inspec
tor, had done his best to obtain a
more prue milk supply but hla ef
forts had been given no Rjmpathy
or support.
In 1915 because of n stirring
educational campaign conducted
i by The Times and heartily sup
ported by Inspector Button, the
city's milk supply was trans
formed. From one of the most
dangerous in the country, it be
came in a few weeks the purest.
118 Instead of in I.
From Jan. 1 to June 30 last
. year there were only 62 deaths
of babies. Between July 1 and
Dec. 31, the death records allow,
61 infants died.
There wore 113 Infantile
deaths as compared to 164 of the
previous year. In September,
1914, the hottest month and
therefore the most dangerous to
babies being fed impure milk,
there were 17 deaths. Last year
five babies died In the same
month.
Government statistics show
that bovine tuberculosis Is fatal I
In 50 par cent of its cases.
Mora than half the mothers of
the present day are feeding their
babies on cow's milk.
When The Times began its
fight for a purer milk supply, It
, showed that hundreds of cows in
the Tacoma district, many of
them In the herds of large and
prominent dairies, were in the
death grip of the dread disease.
Yet their milk was coming to
the city dally In bottles and cans.
Hundreds of mothers, unaware of
the danger, were giving it to their

The facts shocked Tacoma into
action. With one great cry, par
ents made a demand that the
dairies clean up. Arrests were
made.
Dairymen felt the wave of pub
lic emotion. Those who had per
sistently refused to obey orders
of the milk inspection depart
ment before found it was to the
Interest of their pocketbookn to
clean up. Wholesale slaughter of
dt&eased cows began. Inspector
Button instituted a monthly re
port system by which he public

One small boy and two girls are known to have drowned, several others are believed to have perished
and a half a dozen persons were badly injured at 11 o 'clock today when the double deck gasoline launch
Victor II capsized off Point Defiance pavilion.
The launch, which left the municipal dock at 10:30, was making her way toward North Bay in the ter
rific wind and high seas with a load of passengers and lumber piled on her upper deck when she was
suddenly bowled over by a wave, throwing the passengers into the water.
As the launch lay bottom side up in the icy water the passengers clung to her sides until the steamer
Atalanta, which half a mile away was plowing her way from Gig Harbor toward Tacoma, came to the
rescue.
The known dead:
Walter Bower, age 7, son of Mrs. 0. S. Bower, F ox island.
- Florence Bower, age 14, her daughter.
An unknown girl about 12 years old.
Seriously injured:
William Clark, Seattle, cut about the body and suffering from exposure.
Will Mclnnis, lumber worker, Vashon island; may die.
i P. O'Donnell, Vashon; cut and bruised, suffering from exposure.
Peter Sandberg, 406 North Tacoma avenue, Tac oma, in a raving condition, suffering from exposure.
- Mrs. 0. S. Bower, Fox island; hysterical.
w ' Helen, her 17-year dfd daughter.
Joel Bower, 18, another son of Mrs. Bower, was rescued, but did not suffer serious injury.
It was impossible to tell the exact number of ' ~
pjassengers aboard as the fares had not yet been taken
up, nor was it possible to determine the exact num
ber of persons drowned.
The wave which bowled the Victor II over hit
the launch so suddenly and with such force that there
was no opportunity for a warning to be given or for
the lowering of lifeboats, according to the survivors
who were brought in on the Atalanta.
"A terrific sea was running, and we don't exactly
know how it happened," said Dick Wayson, captain
of the launch. The boat was unable to ride the waves
and buck the gale."
In her effort to save the passengers the Atalanta
was washed from stem to stern by the waves and
buffeted about in the high wind.
The accident occurred just as the launch was
rounding the Point on her way down the sound. As
soon as he saw the vessel's plight, Capt. A. R. Hunt
of the Atalanta put on full steam and hurried to the
rescue.
Opposite the smelter heavy waves began rolling
across the bay, driven by a terrific northeast gtde.
that swept down the east passage.
As ue small craft proceeded, the waves mi
i creased in size until they were as high as 10 feet.
The boat bobbed about like a cork. Her captain
• steered a course diagonally across towards
Yashon island, thus taking the waves partially
head-on, and hoping to gain the lee of the islands
The little boat floundered about helplessly in
the trough of the waves. Finally her engines
were disabled by water shipped aboard, and she
drifted Crasily about in the huge waves. Pas
jfeeugers confined to the cabins, which had been
tightly closed because of the stinging cold winds,
were panic-stricken. The boat rolled until its
upper-decks often lay almost tint on the water.
The boat drifted, helpless, a mile from shore
pnd almost directly opposite the park pavilion,
f until one wave larger and more powerful than its
fellows, gave the final blow that tinned the little
craft upside down.
The Victor II is a gasoline passenger steam
er with double decks, and about 50 feet in length,
practically the entire deck space is enclosed in
cabins, making it necessary to often carry freight
on top of the^econd deck.
The vessel makes regular trips on alternate
days between the Municipal dock and North Bay
points, stopping at 20 or more small docks and
landings in the Bay Island district.
She left Tacoma this morning on her regular
southbound trip. Until the Victor II reached
mid-harbor she encountered no heavy weather.
