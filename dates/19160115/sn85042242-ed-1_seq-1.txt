PRICE'S FATE
TWELVE 111
The Case of the Man Accused of
Wife Miu'der Went to Jury
at 4:55.
DEFENSE CAIMS C. D.
ETCHISON IS MURDERER
Judge Stated Only First Degree
Murder or Not Guilty Could
Be Verdict.
(Minneapolis, Minn., Jan. 14.—The
fate of Frederick T. Price, tho Minne­
apolis business man, who has been on
trial since January 4, on a charge of
murdering his wife, tonight rested
with the district court jury.
Went to Jury at 4:55.
At 4 55 p. m., the, case was submit­
ted to the 12 men who, having failed
to reach a verdict at 10 o'clock to­
night, were locked up for the night.
Court will convene again at 10 o'clock
tomorrow morning, when a verdict
will be received if reached.
Day Given to 'Argument.
Today was devoted to concluding
arguments to the jury by M. C. Bra­
dy, chief counsel for the defense,
who sought to refute the testimony
offered by the prosecution in an ef­
fort to send Price to the penitentiary
as the slayer of his wife, Mary Frid
ley Price, daughter of a prominent
Minnesota pioneer. The judge's
charge was comparatively brief. The
prosecution contended the woman
was hurled from a high cliff by Price,
who, When he found she was still
alive, crushed her head with a rock.
The defense has held that the wonian
fell to her death while trying to save
her dog, or that in case she was kill­
ed it was at the hands of Charles D.
lEtchison, a Washington, D. C., trav­
eling salesman, who was jointly in­
dicted with Price, and who has been
the principal witness for the prose­
cution. price expressed himself to
night as confident of acquittal,
The Charge.
Judge Daniel 'Fish in his charge to
the jury said, in part:
"It is unnecessary in this case to
givo particular attention to any de
gree of criminalhoipicide, except that
of murder in the first degree, for the
reason that upon proofs bfore you, if
the defendant-is guilty of homicide
at all, he is guilty of the crime charg­
ed in the indictment."
Attacked 'Etchison's Story.
M. C. Brady, attorney for Price, in
his closing argument, attacked the
story told by Charles 'D. ©tcliison,
chief witness for the prosecution.
While Etchison feared the crime
would be laid to him by Price, Mr.
Erady declared he (Etchison) never­
theless wrote to Price for money for
Ills silence.
Killed By Wrench.
The evidence showed clearly, Mr.
Brady asserted, that if Mrs. Price
was murdered, she was killed by a
blow from a monkey wrench held in
the hand of Etchison and that she
then toppled over the cliff while
Price's back was turned.

'ESSENTIAL ELEIEIfTS
1ST BE PRESERVED'
Says Associate Justice Charles E.
Hughes at Bar Association
Banquet.
New York, Jan. 14.—Jn an address
by Associate Justice Charles E.
Hughes, of the supreme court of the
United States, in which he made a
plea for the preservation of the "es­
sential elements 'of both state and
federal government without permit­
ting necessary local anatomy to be
destroyed by the unwarranted asser­
tion of federal power, and without al­
lowing state action to throw out of
gear the requisite machine for unity
control of national concerns," jvas
one of the ciiief features of the 39th
annual meeting today of the New
York State Bar association.
Justice Hughes' address came at
the end of the session, replete with
interesting discussion and after the
association, by a standing vote, had
refused to consider a resolution criti­
cising the National Socialist party
and referring to the "German Imper­
ial Autocracy" as the "great rival of
the 'American theory of what consti­
tutes liberty and free government."
The resolutions were submitted by
the "committee on the duty of the
courts to refuse to execute statutes
in contravention of the fundamental
law."
The association directed the com­
mittee to fram the resolution in less
objectionable language before it
would pass upon it.

NOT TO INTERVENE
Republicans Are Charged With
Insincerity of Mir
tives.
TO KILL AMERICANS.
El Paso, Texas, Jan. V*.—Gen­
eral Francisco Villa, while at
Ruibico last week, declared he
would kill any Americans trav­
elling west of Chihuahua City,
according to reliable information
received today. At the time Villa
was supplying himself with meat.
It was rumored that Peter Keans,
Englishman, was killed.
'Washington, Jan. 14.—General Car­
ranza and the de facto government
of Moxico are to be given full oppor­
tunity without intervention from the
United States, to run lo earth the
murderers of American citizens at
Santa Isabel, and to demonstrate
their ability to restore order and pro­
tect foreign rights in the southern
republic.
This was the outstanding fact here
tonight, after a meeting of the Cabi­
net, a conference between President
Wilson and Chairman 'Stone of tho.
senate foreign relations committee,
and another day of stirring debate in
the senate chamber.
The president, supported by his
cabinet and the democratic leaders in
congress, is declared to be determin­
ed that the American government
shall not be stampeded by war talk
and cries of vengeance into rushing
an army across the Rio Grande to
destroy in its infancy the de facto
government, which the United States,
with the' co-operation of Pan-Ameri
can nations, aided in eestablishing
after the Mexican nation had been
torn by revolution for years.
Watchful Waiting.
In the senate, administration lead­
ers firmly outlined today the position
of the government in the face of de­
nunciation from the republican side,
and another resolution directing in­
tervention, proposed by Senator
Works of California. At the state de­
partment,- officials were vigilant in
their watch over the situation await­
ing official word from General Car­
ranza in reply to the demand made
upon him to seek out and punish the
bandit murderers.
Dispatch Troops.
While no direct communication
from General Carranza had reached
the state department tonight, a mes­
sage from him to Eliaso Arredondo,
the Mexican ambassador-designate,
announced the dispatch of troops to
capture the outlaws and his purpose
to visit "condign punishment" upon
every participant in the massacre.
"Measures to facilitate the removal
of Americans from districts where
they are in danger were discussed
by department officials. It is estimat­
ed that there are still in districts
whose control by Carranza is doubt­
ful more than 300,000 Americans.
The debate in the senate brought out
the positive declaration of Senator
Stone and Senator Lewis of Illinois
that there would be no countenanc­
ing of the demands of republican
leaders for intervention and 'both
charged the republicans with insin­
cerity of purpose and seeking lo
make a political issue.
Bodies of three of the victims of
the Santa Isabele, Mexico, massacre
—Thomas Evans, M. B. Romero and
J. H. Woon—were interred today
without demonstration on the part of
'Americans, whose threats against
Mexicans lead to the establishment
of a military patrol in the city last
•night.
Mexicans Killed.
Reports were current that incen­
diary posters were being circulated
in Juarez declaring that several
Mexicans had been killed in the
brawls that attended last night's de­
monstrations here, but Mexican con­
suls declared they would find none.
Body Placed in Vault.
Mexicans appeared in numbers on
the streets today. Many of them

ENGLISH TURN HIS
CHECK STUBS OVER
Papers Taken From Attache to
Be Sent to State Depart­
ment.
London, Jan. 14.—"Copies of corres­
pondence siezed from Captain von
Papen, the recalled German military
attache at Washington, when he
reached Falmouth on his way to Ger­
many, have been turned over to the
American embassy for transmission
to the state department.
They show that Captain von Papen
made frequent payment: to persons
charged with responsibility for blow­
ing up of bridges and ammunition
plants in the United Stales.
The correspondence shows that
Von Papen gave $700 to Winner
llorn, who was arrested in connec­
tion with the Canadian Pacific rail­
way bridge at St. Croix, Maine. The
day before this a check was issued,
the German embassy paid $2,000 into
Captain von Papen's account.
Check Stubs
Found.'
Captain von Papen's check stubs,
bank books, and letters I'rom his
bank at Washington, show about. -300
items, many of which have to do
with routine expenditures. Others,
however, revealed payments to var­
ious persons who have figured promi­
nently in the activities of German
agents in America, and to at least
one spy, who committed suicide in a
cell in an English prison.
Several large payments were made
to Captain von Papen li\ Count von
Bernstotff, German aftimSaador "at
Washington. Most of these were for
salaries or bonuses. A number of en­
tries showed payments made by the
ambassador to the military attaches
"for war intelligence office." One of
the payments on this account, made
in October, 1914, was for $2,300.
Another check stub shows that
about' two weeks before the explosion
in Seattle On May 30, 1915, Captain
von Papen sent $")00 to the German
consulate at Seattle. In February of
1915, he sent $1,300 to the German
consulate in that city.
Paid Much Money.
In January, 1915, he gave a check
payable to Amsick & Company, New
York, but with the name E. Kuep
flerle in brackets on the stub. This
is believod to have reference to
Kuepilerle who, alter being in Eng­
land on espionage, committed suicide.
As an example of the size of the
Captain's financial operations, his
.bank books show that in January,
1915, he received approximately
$6,400 and paid cut $5,000.
Among the papers taken from Cap­
tain von Papen, was a letter from the
German consul at New Orleans, con­
doling with him on his recall from
Washington and criticizing severely
the attitude of the American govern­
ment.
COURT DOUBTS STORY.
Washington, Jan. 14.—(When Count
von Bernstorff, the Gorman ambassa­
dor, was shown London dispatches
tonight telling of the correspondence
and accounts taken from von Papen,
the former German military attache
here, his comment, was:
"I don't believe it."
Further than that the ambassador
declined to be quoted for publica­
tion. iHe did make it plain, however,
that he doubted that any documents
of an incriminating nature had been
taken from von Papen.
Seems Incredible.
The impression which was convey­
ed to questioners by officials in Ger­
man diplomatic circles was that tliey
thought it possible that Captain von
Papen had been connected with the
published documents by British
agents. Their argument was that it.
was incredible that von 'Papen, know­
ing that his ship would be taken into
a British port to be searched, would
have carried any correspondence of
such a nature if he possessed it.
Paid Von
5
Papen
Money.
At the embassy tonight it was said
that the ambassador from time to
time had paid much money to Cap­
tain von Papen in salary and expens­
es in such work that lie was expect­
ed to conduct as a military attache.
The embassy, it was said, had no
knowledge of his private 'bank ac­
count or how he dispersed the money.
DisclaiMec knowledge.
Embassy officials specifically dis­
claimed any knowledge of the report­
ed payment of $700 to Wurner Horn,
couaccted with the alleged destruc­
tion of a Canadian Pacific bridge.
They further disclaimed any knowl­
edge of the explosion referred to as
having occurred in Seattle, or of Ku
eppferele, the Brooklyn man, who
several months ago, was caught with
an American passport, and while on
trial as a spy committed suicide in
the tower of London.

of the milk for the use stated.
It is assumed that Great Britain
will make a similar reply.

It was the eighth explosion at the

last three months, with a total of 39
deaths and injury to 20 persons.
The building in which tonight's ac­
cident occurred was of brick and iron
construction and was known as the
nitrate of ammonia crystaliiing
house. The structure was completely
demolished, at an estimated loss of
$23,0-00.
Officials of the company declared it
was the first time they have had an
explosion of this kind. They said it
probably was caused by gas, and stat­
ed the plant is carefully guarded and
that there is no reason to suspect
that the blast was due to other than
natural causes.
