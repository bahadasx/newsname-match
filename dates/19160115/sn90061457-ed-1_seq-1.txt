The Friends of the Candidates are Now
Pushing Claims with Vigor and
Earnestness.
The Whltsell episode has been the
& means of starting the mayoralty cam
paign In real earnest, and as a result
there Is now a noticeable Increase In
the activity of those Democrats who
are aspiring for this coveted honor,
as In the past three days conferences
have been held and the organization
of forces has begun. From this time
on the campaign for the nomination
will be vigorous, notwithstanding the
fact that the date for the Democratic
primary has not yet been fixed, al
though an early meeting of the city
central committee will be held and
the time set.
A movement which had for Its ob
ject the drafting of Col. James H.
McCord as the party candidate, has
failed of accomplishing tne desired re
sult, as Col. McCord has, as on prev
ious occasions refused to become the
standard bearer, as his great business
enterprises will not permit of his tak-

ing the time necessary to give the
city the administration that goes with
all matters that come under the con
trol of Col. McCord.
Dr. Whltsell's Case

Yb jpjm
,11 The question which has arisen as to
the .eligibility of Dr. J. C. Whltsell,
who was considered the most aggres
sive candidate, has caused consider
able change In the situation, and if be
is taken out of the race it may sim
plify matters much, ps It was gener
ally conceded that Dr. Whltsell would
be able to take votes from all of the
other candidates. Dr. Whltsell is a
man of great energy and determina
tion, and has the great knack of mak
ing friends a very powerful adjunct
In a race for office.
There are some fine points in the
question raised as to his eligibility,
and the friends of the doctor see as
many in his favor as the other side of
the question presents to those who
are opposed. The fact, that he has
maintained an office and been In
business here since 1907, it Is con
ceded, would be a valuable point in
the determination of the question of
his eligibility.
MAJOR WILL RUN
The Governor Will Be a Candidate for
Vice President or for the United
States Senate
The question of what Governor
Major of Missouri will do, which has
, been a much vexed one, has at last
been definitely settled and by Gov.
i Major himself. He has made his own
statement, and that is beyond dlspute.-
After the banquet of tho Twenty-
eighth Ward club In St. Louis last
week, at which tho governor was a
guest, he went to Washington, where
Iiq urged the appointment of Judge
Graves to the supreme bench. This
dispatch from there will tell its own
story. It says:
Washington, Jan. 11. "I will cither
be a candidate for vice president of
tho United States or a candidate for
tho senate from Missouri."
That unequivocal statement was
- made by Governor Major of Missouri

Democrat, and Will
the Benefit of
People.
Henry Vogelman Active
Since his resignation from the po
lice board, Henry Vogelman has been
particularly active, something that he
could not consistently do while he was
a state official, and as a result his fol
lowers have also developed much ac
tivity. Mr. Vogelman is ecognlzed
as one of the substantial business men
of the city and has always been active
and aggressive in every movement
that has the advancement of the city
at heart.
The fact that Mr. Vogelman is. rep-'
resentative of the large German popu
lation of St. Joseph it is calculated
by his followers will have much to do
with bringing him a heavy line of
support. Outside of the office of po
lice commissioner he has never be
fore held or asked for public prefer
ment.
Curtln's Friends Working
The friends of Dave Curtin have
assumed a vigorous attitude, and his
stock has been on the up-grade for
the past few days, owing to the vig
orous boosting it has had through
their efforts. While Mr. Curtin has
made no public announcement, he has
nevertheless pleased his hosts of
friends by the manner in which he
has assisted them in their efforts.
It is figured by his friends that the
close race which he gave to Mayor
Marshall the last election, which was
conducted under adverse circum
stances, will be a powerful factor in
his favor in the coming race, and his
supporters are not losing sight of that
pertinent and potent fact.
Robinson Doing Good Work
And to the friends of Walter II
Robinson It must be conceded that
they have done splendid work in his
behalf. They fully realize the fact
that their candidate stands high in
business and financial circles and that
he has decided executive ability,
which would stand him in good hand
as head of the great city of St. Jo
seph. As a campaigner Mr. Robinson has
few equals and his large personal fol
lowing, It may be depended on, will
make him a potent factor when the
real test comes. There will be noth
ing left undone by his following to
pluck tho plum.
At-movement was started to attempt
to bring out Louis V. Stlgall as a
candidate, but Mr. Stlgall, owing to
the fact that he is now the head of
the Monroe club, has refused to take
a part in the contemplated program.
Several dark horses, it is said, are
now being groomed for the race, but
so far they have not come out Into the
open. Taken In all, the race prom
Ises to be a pretty one, and the win
ner will be the next mayor of St
Joseph.
MISSOURI MAY HAVE AN
UNFINISHED CAPITOL
Will Have to Pass New Laws Before
State House Can Be
Completed
It is possible that Missouri may
have an undecorated state capltcl
building If the statement of E. W
Stephens, chairman of the capitol
commlsslonis correct.
Stephens 'states that the recent de
cision of tho supremo court, which
said the capitol commission had no
authority to spend an appropriation of
1300,000 for furniture, has set mem
bers of the commission to studying
tho law. They have found that no
provision has been made for decora
tions. If such provision is not in
cluded In the hill which finally will
allow the purchase of furniture, then
it will be up to state officials to pain
the walls and hang their own pictures

KIND WORDS FOR REED
Missouri's Newspapers Championing
His Cause and Ask That He Be
Renominated and Re-elected
I'oi ty or fifty exchanges from south
east Missouri are received In The
otanuaru onice, ana not one paper
against Senator Heed for re-election.
In the" early months of the Wilson
administration several papers, of
which The Standard was one, thought
Mr. Heed was filibustering against
jomc of the Democratic measures un
Jer discussion, but time has shown
that Senator Reed was right, and
when these measures became laws
they were perfect and had teeth in
them.
The banking law In Its present per
fect condition is due to Senator Reed's
foresight and staying qualities. If It
had not been for this one law, Wall
street would have caused the greatest
panic In the money market that ever
occurred In the history of the coun
try. He Is the most brilliant orator
in the senate and as a debater has no
superior. With Senator Stone and
Senator Reed representing Missouri,
she will have the strongest represent
atlves of any state In the Union. Sen
ator Reed should be renominated and

MAY SPIKE A GUN
An Unburnt Letter From William
Jennings Bryan Regarding the
One-Term Plank
Washington, Jan. 13. There is in
existence a letter written by William
J. Bryan in which the Commoner
practically releases President Wilson
from any obligation under the single
term plank of the Baltimore platform,
not to run for a second term. Presi
dent Wilson's political advisers expect
to use this letter against Mr. Bryan if
the latter, as has been intimated,
seeks to make any issue of a second
term for Mr. Wilson.
This letter was written by Mr.
Bryan in 1913, when a resolution was
pending in congress limiting the presi
dency to a single term. Mr. Bryan
wrote to a member of congress that
the one-term plank was intended
merely as a declaration of policy and
should not be binding on any individ
ual until legislation lmd been passed
and It applied to all parties alike.
This Information followed today on
the heels of a disclosure as to Presi
dent Wilson's own views on the one
term plank.
The understanding here now Is that
the president will encounter the oppo
sition of Bryan in his effort to bo re
nominated, notwithstanding the Bryan
letter. Bryan feels that there has been
no serious effort on the president's
part to live up to the spirit of the one
term plank, and he will attack him on
that score.

Editor Moorhead Dors Not Believe

When It comes to standpatlsm, Dea

of The Journal, of Hopkins, is, as the

moosey for he will not be handled.
And here, in his last Issue, in his own
words, is his defl:
If It Is really true that only one man
In tho United States Is capable of sav
ing tno Republican party, then we say
let tho Republican party go straight
to defeat, for It would be unworthy
of success. It is tho Democratic sym
pathizers and mugwumps who aro put

I.S NO WONDER
Blggerstaff Was In Plattsburg
and That Is Given as the Rea.
son for a "Hot Air" Story
Plattsburg, the capital of Clin
ton county, was "all writ up" in
the Sunday Gazette. One would
think, after inhaling the veritable
sirocco of hot air, that the citi
zens of that erstwhile moral and
law-abiding town were at each
others' throats, and that a killing
and knock-down-and-drag-out was
staged about every thirty mln-
utes. Many people here who read
the, Plattsburg papers wondered
why, with so many homicides and
assaults as chronicled in The Ga-
zette, that the Plattsburg papers
never heard enough of the doings
to mention them, it was hardly
thought possible that the papers
there had become so calloused
and hardened that such affairs
did not even rise to the dignity
of a casual mention, for if they
knew of such occurrences they
never noticed them.
Hut a possible explanation
reached this paper Tuesday, which
may( explain the situation. A
PUttsburg correspondent writes:
"Bryant Blggerstaff was in
Plattsburg a few days ago, and
that, we think, accounts for the
"hot air" article In Sunday's Ga
ze to. Next to his obituary, that
takes the cake."
Blggerstaff will be well remem-
bered as the versatile and luridly
imaginative young man who for
a short time held down a "Dort-
folio" in The Gazette's local rooms
and whose crowning achievement
'n newspaper fakerism was when
some years ago, he sent out, via
was murdered literally hacked
to pieces and his scattered and
dead remains were found some
, hours later robbed of a half
busfcql, more or less, of money,
diamonds, etc. principally the
latter Ingredient.
It is needless to remark that
Immediately on discovery of the
real truth, the Associated Press
corrected the story and B. B. left
for other fields.

recently organized, the Bachelors club,

The officers and members of this

to St. Joseph for this occasion their
friends and acquaintances, and when
they get them here, it is only a con

CALLICOTTE DISGUISED AS A

George A. Calllcotte, a former Rock

by five leputy sheriffs and Rock
Island operators, after a fierce strug
gle, and taken to the county jail,
whero he is now Incarcerated in de
fault of ball In the sum of $10,000. He Is
charged with subornation of perjury.
When arrested Calllcotte was dis
guised as a woman. Last year he se
cured a verdict of 118,000 against tho
Rock Island as the result of an al
leged fall from a train, which he
claimed caused total paralsls. After
his arrest, Dr. M. J. Farber, his physi

In a Scathing Address Governor Cap.
per of the Sunflower State De
nounces the Legalized Extortion
Which, Through Its Influence, Has
Caused the Gas Consumers of St.
Joseph To On More Than Onc.Occa
cion Feel the Effects of The p-
ulatlons
Since the cold weather the people of
St. Joseph who depend more or less
on natural gas for cooking and heat'
ing purposes have felt the iron heel
of the Kansas manipulators of the
vapor, who have, through their in'
trlgue and machinations, made it im
possible for the St. Joseph Gas com'
pany to at all times supply their pa'
trons here with a sufficient volume o
the product. The persons guilty of
this outrage on the people of St. Jo
seph are the receivers and the law
yers for the Kansas Natural Gas com
pany, whom In a caustic address at
Parsons the other night Governor
Capper of the Sunilower state charac
terized as "a pack of hungry wolves
trailing a hamstrung steer and not en
titled to as much respect as a bank
burglar"!
Governor Capper did not mince
words and his address was a scathing
denunciation of the courts that would
permit such pillage and the men who
would take such fees, which the pub
He must ultimately pay.
The governor was speaking before
the Anti-Horsethlef. Association, in
session there. His subject was "Law
Enforcement." He explained in detail
how hard It was to enforce laws when
such "robberies" as the Kansas Nat
ural receivership were perpetrated
upbn a long suffering public, and as
serted that such "lawful extortion'
had been the cause of much of the
prevailing disrespect for law now so
apparent In this country.
Weak In Respect for Law
"Perhaps our greatest weakness as
a nation," said the governor, is our
lack of respect for law. This is not to
be wondered at when it appears that
our courts and our great corporations
may evade and ignore or impede the
law with Impunity, whenever and
wherever they see fit. We have seen,
over and over again, a fatal paralysis
overtake justice when a smart lawyer
and a long pocketbook were In the
case, and only law and justice and a
smaller pocketbook were on the other
side to oppose them.
"We have recently learned that in
the Kansas Natural Gas case twenty
one lawyers and receivers participated
in the grab, some of them receiving as
high as $22,000 each. The total cost
of this brief receivership, which the
people ultimately will have to pay, is
nearly one-third of a million dollars.
"We now find the state receivers In
this case receivers appointed by a
Kansas court resisting efforts of the
state to restore this public utility to
service.
"Like a Pack of Hungry Wolves"
"Lawyers to right of them; lawyers
to left of them; lawyers In front, be
hind and all around them, like a pack
of hungry wolves trailing a hamstrung
steer., this is the position of the Kan
sas Natural Gas company and the peo
ple of Kansas. The lawyers, by rais
ing a federal question now have the
receivership case In the federal courts
and further rich picking in fees and
emoluments will be added to the hun
dreds of thousands already bled from
the public. Meantime the whole Mid
die West Is receiving such a lesson on
the decadence of some of its courts
and forms of law that a way to pro
tect tho public from such betrayal and
legalized robbery In future Impresses
the people ns Imperative.
"The attorneys and receivers who
participate In this graft seem to have
no sense of decency, no feeling of
shame when it comes to appropriating
money to their own use, which they
are presumed to bold as a sacred
trust.

DR. IMPEY STRICKEN
A Former Well Known Physician and
Surgeon of Northwest Missouri

Dr Charles Impey, formerly one of
the well known physicians of North
west Missouri, but who hae for a num
ber of late years practiced his pro
fession in Omaha, was fatally strick
en on Monday afternoon and passed
away In a few moments. Dr. Impey
was born In New Market, Platte coun

Of his taking away the Omaha World-
Herald says:
"Stricken suddenly with cerebral
hemmorhage while riding in an auto
mobile, Dr. Charles Impey, among the
oldest and most popular of Omaha
physicians and surgeons, died at 5:30
o'clock Monday afternoon.

nearing the hospital the eider Dr. Im
pey g sped for breath and lapsed into
unconsciousness.
"Throwing on full speed. Dr. C. "
Impey dashed up to the hospital en
trance. A hasty examination while in
the automobile showed the son that
his father was already dead.
"For some time past Dr. Impey had
been troubled with high blood pres
sure and arterial disorder, but had
not been alarmed, and had not missed
a day from his office. Yesterday
morning he had performed a delicate
operation at the Wise hospital, and
was returning to care for other-patients
when death overtook him.
"Dr. Impey was 63 years old. After
completing his medical education he
came to Omaha in 1885 and had prac
ticed continuously In this city ever
since. He and his son had offices to

ing. "Dr. Impey was a member of the
American Medical association, and
was a prominent member also of the
