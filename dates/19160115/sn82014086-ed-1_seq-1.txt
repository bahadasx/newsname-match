ACID HOUSE OF DUPONT '
POWDER PLANT BLOWN UP.
Eighth Explosion ; in Dupont Plants
in Vicinity of Philadelphia in Three
Months. . . .
Philadelphia, Jen. 14. An acid
house at the plant of the - Dupont
Powder company at Gibbstown, N. J.,
blew up tonight injuring five workmen;
two of them probably fatally. It was
the eighth explosion at the Dupont
plants in this section in the last three
months with a total of 33 deaths and
injury to 20 persons.'
The building in which tonight's ac
cident occurred was of brick and iron
construction and was known as the
nitrate of ammonit crpstalteing house.
It was here nitrate was transformed
from the crystal to the liquid form to
be used in the manufacture of dyna
mite. The structure was completely
demolished at an estimated loss of
J25.000. Officials of the company de
clared it was the first time they have
had an explosion of this kind. They
said it probably was caused by gas
which had formed in the process of
transforming the nitrate srystals.
"W. B. Blandis, representing the com
pany, said the plant Is carefully
guarded and there is no reason to sus
pect the blast, la, due to other than
natural causes. Edward Bubb, su
perintendent of the plant and Isaac
Gibson were the most seriously hurt.
It is feared neither will recover.

NEW YORK JEWELERS ;
CHARGED WITH SMUGGLING
Herman 'J. Dietz & Son Accused' sf
Bringing Diamonds from Canada.
New - York, Jan. 14. Herman J.
Diets, who was a diamond dealer at
87 Nassau street, and his son, Charles
Bietz, were placed on trial today be
fore Judge Hunt in the criminal branch
of the United States district court on
charges of engaging in a conspiracy
to smuggle diamonds into this coun
try, from Canada. - :--
According to Roger B. Wood, assist
ant United States district attorney,
who, with Samuel Hershenstein, is
prosecuting the case,' in the years 1911
and 1914 diamonds in considerable
quantities were smuggled across the
border from Mpntreal and other points
in Canada. An investigation made by
Frank Burke, secret service agent, re
vealed the fact that diamonds worth
J700.000 had entered the country with
out th epayment of duty.
Diamonds ordered by Herman J.
Dietz from ruenweig & Zimmer, of
Antwerp, according to Mr. Wood, were
sent in furtherance of the scheme to
a certain firm of pawnbrokers of Mon
treal. The jewels, in 325,000 lots, Mr.
Wood , says, were secretly - conveyed
across the international line by agents
of the smugglers, who received from
350 to 3100 on each trip. On occasion,
the indictment charges, Dietz and his
son personally brought diamonds over
from Canada.
MAKING TEST CASE
OF EXPATRIATION.
Arrest of Frank Caswell, Who Had
Joined Canadian Regiment for War.
Washington, Jan. 14. The depart
ment" of labor issued a warrant today
for the arrest at Detroit of Frank
Caswell, an American, discharged re
cently from the Canadian forces, to
maKe a test case to have the, United
States courts determine if an Ameri
can citizen expatriates himself by en
listing in a foreign army.
The-technical charge against Caswell
is violation of the contract labor law
in entering the United States to take
employment at Detroit. The decision
is expected to fix definitely the status
of hundreds of Americans returning
rrom army service abroad.
Caswell, a native of Harrison, Me.,
enlisted with Canadian expeditionary
forces last April, but was discharged
in England for physical disability and
returned to Canada. On an offer of
employment at Detroit, he tried to re
enter the United States at Port Huron,
Mich, but was-excluded by the immi
grant officers. . , - ..

SNIPING BY FLEMISH
RESIDENTS OF BELGIUM
A Source -of . Much .Trouble to the
British and French Armies.-
Montreal, Jan. : 14. Sniping by
Flemish residents of Belgium has been
the source of much trouble to the
British and French armies, according
to Charles Gaudet, K. C, who arrived
here today from the western battle
front. Mr. Gaudet said that the snip
ing in and about a certain Belgian
town occupied by the British had
caused his brother, a colonel command
ing the Twenty-second regiment, com
posed of French-Canadians, to threat
en to hold the town's authorities to ac
countability if the practice continued.
The majority of the Flemish residents
of BelgiUm are closely related to the
Germans, he said, and for this reason
are strongly sympatheticwith them.

Best Tonic For Run Down Condition
A man in business can make a living, no doubt, upon mere
routine lines. But does It satisfy when others are forging .ahead
and increasing their business and profits by telling the people that
they are in business and bidding for their trade? A business that
makes no progress is really on the decline. The tonic for such a
condition is advertising, and advertising which not solely fills space
but which appears in a medium which goes to the homer of the pur
chasing public within the buying radius where it is sought and read
for the trading opportunities and news which it contains and which
therefore brings results.
Furthermore an advertising campaign must be conducted like any
other;' it must be intelligently planned and consistently carried out
and when that" is don there is no service in this part of Connecti
cut which can equal that furnished by The Bulletin. It leads as a
newspaper and it leads as an advertising medium.
During the past week the following matter has appeared in its

Questioned by Counsel for Negroes.
Questions asked by counsel for the
negroes in cross examination of Thorn,
as Bobbins, chief of police of Barring,
ton, were taken as indicating that the
defense was particularly interested in
learning whether George W. Healis,
Dr. Mohrs negro chauffeur, had a re
volver on the night of the murder.
Healis, who was originally held on the
same charge as the other negroes, has
since been allowed to plead nolo con
tendre to a charge of manslaughter,
and is expected, to be a witness for
the state.
Chief Bobbins in his direct exami
nation had related how Brown and
Spellman pointed out to him places
on the shore of Echo lake, near the
scene of the tragedy, where they had
thrown their revolvers into the water.
"Didn't Healis, the chauffeur, have
a gun at or about the time of the
shooting?" inquired Attorney Lewis.
The prosecuting attorney objected. "I
think the court sees the drift," sug
gested Mr. Lewis.
Healis Owned a Revolver.
The judge was inclined to rule it
out, but after Mr. Lewis had -whispered
something to him the question was
allowed and Chief Bobbins stated that
Healis did own a revolver about this
time.
- The state then brought out that the
weapon owned by Healis had been
found in Dr. Mohr's garage at New
port after Healis was arrested. Mr.
Lewis drew from ' the chief a state
ment that he did not know whether
Healis had another revolver and had
it with him on the night of the shoot
ing. ' . . ,
Unable to Find Revolvers.
Chief Bobbins said further in cross
examination that the lake bottom had
been dragged with oyster tongs in an
effort to find the revolvers which
Brown and Spellman are alleged to
have thrown there, but that the
weapons had not been found.
Mrs. Mohr Betrays Emotion.
The prosecution offered for identifi
cation the hat which Dr. Mohr wore at
the time he was shot. There is a bullet
hole through it. As the exhibit was
shown to Chief Rabbins, - Mrs. Mohr
seemed to he unnerved. - ..
Tears flooded her eyes for v moment,
but she quickly recovered - her com
posure. ' . i
