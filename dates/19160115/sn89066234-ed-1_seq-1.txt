ABOUT PREPAREDNESS.
How Does Conscription Sound to You. Do You Want
Your Sons to Forcibly Become Trained Murderers?

in my opinion, the crax.v prepar

we must look under the cover
During the past six months Roose

the president does not ravor his
prepa redness program.
The New York Evening Post, B
Democratic paper, and the only
capitalist paper in that city op
posing the administrations war
polity, makes the charge that
Mr. Wilson is playing politics. Sam
Blythe, an experienced Washing
ton newspaper correspondent, In
me Saturday Evening Post, says
there is a vast amount of poli
tics n preparedness, winch caus
es Allen L. Benson to ask:
How do you like to have your
representatives in Washington

zine with political matches? Does
it never occur to yon that If this
magazine should go off. it might
blow you up? How is .vour boy
setting along? Will lie be old
enough to be conscripted next
vear into 541,000 standing army
that the Wilson administration is
trying to Induce congress to es
tablish? That army is a very real
danger. The talk of conscription
is getting louder every day. Two
years ago we should not have
thought such a thing possible.
Now it is a fact. Only an ava
tanoh of protesting letters to
Congressman and senators can
prevent the raising of a big army
by conscription."
And how foolish is all this pre
paredness nonsense? Never was
this country In less danger of
Invasion. Who is going to get

any, after the European war is

satisfied to nurse her bruises and
behave for a while.
The Germany that emerges at
he end of the war will not be
the same Germany that went to
war-no matter who wins. ine
ermany that went to war was
the military party and that has
been shot to pieces and will never
be permitted to come back. The
Germany that is fighting today.
and will lie fighting at the close
of the war. Is a new Germany
the people fighting to rataiti the
Fatherland and to prevent en
slavement by foreign rulers. The
War Lords began this war. but
the people win end it. an i they
win never again permit the ex
istence of War Lords who may,
at any time drive them to the
slaughter.
I am a pretty good guesser.
and 1 want to say here that, at
the close of this war. tho terms of
peace will not be dictated by n
few lawyers, preachers, politi
cians and other parasites at the
banquet table. Rather, it will be
n crumbling of thrones and a
kicking out of rulers all over Eu
rope,
But they want us to prepare.
What for? I can only teli it as I
see it. Judging from their acts,
the powers that be in this coun
try fear that Germany will win.
In that case that rive hundred
million dollar loan made v the
allies by Wall Street might look
like a eu tor nickel, We m ist he
prepared to maice uermany as
sume that dcht ill case tne allies
are defeated. And to do this we
must have a stronger navy than
Germany,
Do you know that this is all the
navy Is for? A navy Is an inter
national constable, and if a na
tion, or the capitalists of a na
tion, owes us and we can't get
the money any other way. we
steam our navy into the ports of
entry, take charge of the cus
toms receipts just as we did at
Yera Crux. Mexico, without any
excuse and take the money.
But, of course, we never do
these things with any evil motive
We always wrap ourselves In "the
flag" and are guided by Divine
Providence" The chaplain al
ways prays before the first gun
Is fired. It WOUld not do to
slaughter and steal except under
the cloak of patriotism and relig
ion Otherwise it would be Just
plain murder and robbery.
Not so long ago
wo were lett'h
go of some great gobs of slobb
about the Inhumanity of Ge
manv towards Belgium. Our go
eminent protested vigorously to
Germany about her barbarism
and violation of international
law.
A little later something else
happened. But you didn't l!''.,:
much nixitit that. This govern
ment did Just what we ha i n
demned so piously in Germany,
and the German government pro
tested against OUT barbarism and
violation of International law,
it was this way, Haiti Is a
little republic In the Atlantic
Ocean. The population Is colored
American capitalists have their
claws on the little republic and
dictate its government. The peo
ple rebelled and overthrew the
government, but our navy was
"Johnnie on the spot," overthrew
the people and took charge of the
revenues. The Appeal to Reason
asks:
"What was the motive of this
government of ours In this forci
bly occupying Haitian territory
at the same tHue it was hypocrit
ically protesting against the Ger
man Invasion of Belgium and flni
phrases wore being turned out by
diplomats about the rights of hu
manity? The ever-powerful mo
tive that Is concealed behind most
of tho acts of modern capitalist
governments the motive of pri
vate financial gain, The rep ita
lic of Haiti was in the debt of
American bondholders, The
bondholders were afraid they
would lose some money . hen
dollars are in danger, diplomacy
unmasks and reveals its true cap
italistic character.
"Tho United States government
sent its defense' navy to sleie
the customs iort of Haiti, estab
lished officers in control of the
civil and financial affairs of the
republic anil thus collect the
aforementioned debt at Nl'St
hand. The revenues of the Hai
tian government are now in the
hands or military representatives
of the United States government.
The government of the republic
has been subjected to the military
control of foreign power and the
republic of Haiti now is. to all in
tents and purposes, nothing more
than a colony of the United
States."
But let us look a little deeper
Into this preparedness business
At every session of congress for
the past 25 years we have heard
the same song, and always from
the same source, it comes from
those who profit from the sale
of war supplies. Usually it is lit
tle Japan that is going to get us.
but this time it is Germany, and
the noise is much louder. They
tell us we are unprepared. What
has become of the millions and
billions already appropriated by
former congresses? Who got it'.'
And wouldn't the same chaps get
the next appropriation?
What do they mean by prepar
edness? If they mean any thing,
they mean that we should be bet-
i
tor prepared to murder than any
other nation or troup of nations
Suppose, then, we undertake to
prepare against Germany, wc
already have as strong a navy as
Germany and one battle ship to
spare. But could not tiermany
build ships as fast ns we? Sup
pose there was really something
to .ill this noise, and congress au
thorised ten battle-ships, What
would prevent Germany from au
thorizing twelve?
Capitalism is the craziest con
glomeration of errors and con
tradictions that it Is possible to
imagine. As a nation wc arc
asked to go "armed to the teeth."
