REMEMBER
MGRAFTERS
The Records Show that City Ad
ministrations Did Not View
Them with Disfavor.
What do people pay taxes for?
The answer, of course, should be
for tho common good; for protection
of property and health and necessary
public conveniences.
But Is this tho truth?
So far as Chicago Is concerned It
Is a case puro nnd simple of "tho
public bo d d."
Our city government, ns exemplified
by facts covering tho past twenty
years, is, In plain English, simply a
method of enriching politicians and
grafters at the oxpenso of tho tax
payers. Tho alleged rottenness of tho Har
rison administration has never been
thoroughly shown up. It has often
been alluded to.
Mayor Thompson mado a four flush
over tho alleged discovery of how tho
taxpayers had been beaten out of mil
lions of dollars by an alleged ring of
city officials and public contractors.
A number of officials were suspend
ed. Soem others were fired.
Tho charges still exist, but Thomp
son has lost Interest In them.
What Chicago needs is a Vlgtlanco
Commltteo to prob.c.pa-'t city admin
istrations and scare present ones into
doing their duty.
But it Is not In tho vlco kings nnd
procurers of past regimes that tho
people aro Interested.
They nre Interested In finding out
what becamo of their hard-earned
money that they paid for taxes.
Tho Thompson administration has
lifted the curtain high enough to
show, It Is claimed, where a million
or two of graft disappeared to.
Why doesn't tho Thompson adminis
tration keep the curtain up? Tho
pcoplo want to know.
THOMPSON WILL RUN
Mayor Announces That He Will
Be a Candidate for Delegate
at Large.
"Who Is going to prevent me from
being a candidate for delegate at
largo?" asked tho mayor of a re
porter. "Well, Senator Sherman as a candl
dato for president has tho authority
to disavow your running In his name,"
said the reporter.
"As I understand it, any person that
wants to bo a candidate has only to
fllo his petition with tho secretary
of state and his name will be printed
on the ballot," said tho mayor.
"Then It Is to be taken you are to
bo a candidate for delegate at large
in any event?" said the reporter.
"I take It that way," was the terse
reply of the mayor.
The Sherman men aro now talking
of a substitute for the mayor and ono
for Mr. West In their plan of elimi
nating the personalities. Charles A.
McCulloch was mentioned along with
Charles S. Deneen. The mayor's at
titudo will mean either Mr. West will
bo forced In ns a delegato at largo
candidate or that Senator Sherman
will bo forced to disavow tho mayor
as a candldato under Sherman colors.
Peaco negotiations go over until next
weok.
JUDGES DUCK PRIMARY
Superior Judges Do Not Want
People to Vote on Nomina

Judges of tho Superior Court con
ferred with the state executive rela
tive to the Idea of consolidating the
June judicial election with the April
4 aldermanlo contest to affect a sav
ing of some 1500,000 in election ex
penses. Amendment to the ballot law
Is one of the subjects in the call and
this will alow action by the legisla
ture on tho separate ballot proposi
tion as well as consolidation of the
judicial and aldermanlo elections.
The Superior Court judges six of
them whoso terms expire are under
stood to have told Gov. Dunne they
do not favor a primary election for
their nomination: they ' prefer the
nominations to be made by convention
made up of the party county committeemen.

WACKERWVES FACTS
Chairman of Chicago Plan Com
mission Tells Congress West
Side Site Is Best.
In urging Congress to give $6,000,
000 for the proposed sito for tho new
Chicago post olllco on tho WcHt Side,
Mr. Wacker, as chairman of tho plan
commission, mado tho principal argu
ment. Ho urged the proposal as ono
purely of good business for tho gov
ernment, saying:
"So far as postal business Is con
cerned, Chicago produces bigger pos
tal receipts than New York by about
$30,000 a month. Our post olllco sys
tem turns over to tho treasury of tho
United States $13,000,000 annual profit.
Dased on our growing postal busi
ness, the profit will be doubled by
the time tho now postal building is
ready for use.
"As Chicago is tho distributing cen
ter, the postal facilities In our city
must be on a larger scalo than any
place cIbo In America."
Mr. Wacker said tho delegation
based its argument on theso flvo ele
ments: .
"1. Proximity of tho slto to twoj
great railway terminals, In which
over 62 per cent of all the mall is
handled, is nothing less than provi
dential, j
"2, Its accessibility and position
with respect to tho orderly design of
They Are Seen by
of Their
Nature From All Parts
In It.
Chicago's street system give It a
scientific character.
"3. It provides a building area not
only sufficient for all future time,
but also at so low n cost that tho
government will find In It nn excel
lent realty investment.
"4. At no other point can ns largo
a street area bo provided for postal
trulllc and so avoid congestion and
delay.
"5. Only by developing u two-block
site can tho needs of Chicago and tho
nation be met.
