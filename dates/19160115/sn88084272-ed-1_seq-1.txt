this crisis," said senator Stone, "and
assured him that ws could do nothing
toward confirmation of Henry E
Fletcher, the president's nominee for
ambassador to the defacto government,
until the president replied to senator
Fall's resolution. The secretary as
sured me the data, would be ready
early next week. I have called a
meeting of tho foreign relations com
mittee for next Wednesday and hope
the information will be ready then.
Senators Oppose Cammia,
"One or two senators have Indicated
that they would not vote to send an
ambassador to Carranza at all. Sen

confirm the nomination because he re-

isoran has intimated that he "will op
pose confirmation for the reason that
he regards the Carranza government aa

Mr. Arredondo, who later advised Gen.
Carranza by wire that every assistance
be given such Americans and escorts
provided to accompany them Into cities
where strong garrisons are main
tained. He went further than the state
department suggested, recommending
that In cases where foreigners object
