Wilmington Wrecked by Explosions
?Secret Service Men Seek Clues to
identity of "Outside Influences/'
Wilmington, Del. Jan. 10.?Follow?
ing the explosion at the Dupont pow?
der plant at Carney's Point, N. J.,
early today, in which three worRmen
were killed, two mills blew up at the |
upper Hagley yard near here this af?
ternoon. In one of the latter acci
|dents one workman was slightly burn?
ed. The three explosions within one
day have had the effect of making the
secret service and police departments
of the DuPont Powder Company un- j
usually active in looking for possible |
clues indicating "outside influence." I
A press mill blew up at 3 o'cloc
this afternoon. It was in this explo
sion that the workman . was hurt.
Ninety minutes' laMjfjga mixing mill
near the press mllfflffo exploded. It
contained 500 pounds of powder. No
I one was injured. Both mills were
.blown to atoms, the shocks being
.heard for at least twenty-five miles.
The disaster at Carney's Point was
due to an explosion of smokeless pow
der, while at the upper Hagley yard
it was black powder that went off.
j Up to a late hour tonight there were
no developments as to the cause of
the explosions. While expressing
the belief that all the blasts were due
to accidents, officials of the company
have issued instructions for.a sear?h
.ing Investigation.

FAILS TO PRESENT EVIDENCE
Buchanan Again Tries to Get Action
on Impeachment of His Prosecutor.
Washington, Jan. 11.?Representa?
tive Buchanan of Illinois today unsuc?
cessfully sought the adoption of a res?
olution to have the judiciary commit?
tee begin immediately an inquiry into
his impeachment charges against
United State's Attorney Marshall of
New York. Representative Moss of
West Virginia opposed the resolution
on the ground that Representative
Buchanan "had not yet offered a
shred of evidence to the comnilttee
and ho has had two opportunities to
do so/'
Assaults on the resolution piled on
from all sides and Buchanan finally
withdrew it with the understanding
that he might present it later in a dif?
ferent form. j
Buchanan brought his charges soon
after Mr. Marshall ordered a grand
'jury investigation into Labor's Na?
tional Peace council for alleged actlv
jity in fomenting strikes in American
munitions plants. Buchanan and some
'others identified with the council since
'have been' indicted for conspiracy to
restrain American trade in war ex?
ports.

Would Hold Outgo Down Until Tax
Burdens Shall Have Been Equaliz?
ed by State Tax Commission.
Columbia, Jan. llf:?"Appropriations
should not be increased more than
absolutely necessary until the system
for the assessment of property has
been so reformed as to equalize the
burden," said Carlton W. Sawyer,
comptroller general, in a statement
yesterday regarding the financial con?
dition of the State.
j "Only $587,780.31 of taxes amount?
ing to $2,176,360 levied in 1916 was
paid by December 31, 1916. When
the balance of the tax levy for the
fiscal year 1915, $1,588,569.69,* shall
have been collected and paid to the
State -treasury, and the curent debts

^ s for use in meeting the current
^penses of 1916.
^ "The apparent balances brought
over to the present year do not rep?
resent cash in the treasury, available
to meet current expenses. December
31,1915, there was only $332,634.71
I
.cash in treasury so available. The
, balance apparently in the treasury
represents special accumulated sink?
ing funds?funds held in trust for
special purposes, uncollected taxes
land unexpended approriatlons ac?
cumulated from year to year.
"At no one time is the apparent
amount of these balances actually
available and represented by cash in
the treasury. But so much as is
vallablc has been used from year to
year, in meeting and discharging the
current expenses of the State, in an?
ticipation of the collection of taxes
and at the end of the iscal year
these balances reappear as an appar?
ent estimated surplus on the books of
the State.
"The accumulation of apparent bal
lances from year to year and their
of the following year Is due to bur
system of tax collections, the expen?
ditures being made every year before
the taxes levied therefor are collected
and It wi'l be seen, by a comparison
of the current figures with the bal?
ances brought forward for many
years past, that we are rapidly go?
ing into debt, decreasing the appar?
ent reserve or accumulations, and'in?
creasing the amount necessary to be
borowed in order to meet the ap
' propriatlons.
"The State revenue for 1916, from
taxes, estimated and based upon the
present assesesment of $*310,907,101,
at a rate of 7 mills on the dollar,
would be $2,176,350. To this add the
estimated income from sources other
than taxes of $354,230, and we have
a total estimated revenue of $2,
530,580. ' ,
"The appropriations asked for by
the various institutions and depart?
ments, $3,147,754.38, er.ceed the es?
timated revenue of the State by $971,
404 under a levy of 7 mills, and if all
appropriations asked for are made, It
will be necessary to make a rate of
10 mills on the dollar to raise the
appropriations, for section 2, ar?
ticle 10, of the constitution requires
a levy sufficient to pay the .ordinary
expenses of the State, together with
any existing deficiency :n the preced?
ing year. ' It therefore seems that
appropriations should not" be increas?
ed more than absolutely necessary
until the system for the assessment
of property has been so reformed as
to equalise the burden."
