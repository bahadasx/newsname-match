Chicago, January 10. A decision
rendered in tho courts of Chicago to
day by Judge Smith sustained tho do
murrer of attorncjs Walter M Farm
er of this city, nnd Wm. Harrison, of
Oklahoma City, recognizing tho Na
tional Ilaptlst Convention of which 11
P. Jones, I). D, of Vlcksburg, Miss.,
was elected president. It will bo re
membered that during tho month of
September last year tho Uaptlsts held
a convention In this city and divided
Into two parts over a charter gotten
ot by seven men. A majority of ono
hundred fifty or more votes In tho Con-
vctlon was against tho charter, where
upon. Dr. Morris and his followers left
tho chair nnd tho Convention immedi
ately elected 11 P. Jones and an en
tirely now set of officers. Tho Incor
porated Convention led by Dr. Morris
got out an Injunction to prevent tho
Jones peoplo from using tho name "Na
tional Ilaptlst Convention." Tho caso
has been hinging flro and tho decision
today by tho court Is far-reaching, as
It tears down and virtually eliminates
tho Incorporated faction as a national
body. Tho contest was sharp and pro
longed. Ablo counsel represented both
sides, but In tho demurrer offered by
tho attorneys for tho Jones faction
every contention mado and tho flvo
points of law presented were upheld.
President Jones was reached by wire
In Philadelphia and expressed himself
as well pleased, declaring that ho
know tho will of tho majority of tho
Uaptlsts would bo sustained. It Is
said that this decision puts tho Incor
porated faction to rout. It is learned
that President Jones will cnll a meet
ing of his advisors, consisting of tho
chairmen and tho secretaries of tho
various Boards, together with tho elec
tive officers to meet In Nashville at
an early date.

(From tho Chicago Defender)
Robert Crawford, 3829 Vlnclnnes
avenue, a soventeen year old youth, Is
astounding tho world with his know
ledge ot wireless telegraphy. Robert
has. while a student at tho Wendell
Phillips high school, built for himself
tho cnlro wireless station which ho
has at his homo. All tho wiring, coll
work, transmitter, receiver, telegraph
keys nnd all other parts of this won
derful working apparatus was tho
work of his own handi
Ho formerly controlled six wire?,

Young Crawford has talked to Key
West, Fla., and most of the Atlantic
coast towns. Ho Is a member of tho
Wireless Club, which are all whito
except himself. Ho Is a student of
the Wendell Phillips high school nnd
has mado a record that every boy
Bhould bo proud of. All high schools
in tho country should tako this caso
for an example and strive to point out
tho good this young man has accom
plished. Tho young man has a won
derful future before him. Ho Is also
an artist ot raro ability.
Tho spring grain aphis, popularly
known as tho green bug, has appeared
In grain fields In Tennessee, Texas,
Oklahoma, Kansas, and In northeast
ern ..ew Mexico, and It Is probable
that it Is also In southern Missouri
and Arkansas. Tho dangor ot this
pest doing serious damago in the
spring depends to a great extent up
on tho weather between now and the
middle of April, if tho temperature
during this period Is sufficiently high
to enable tho green buk to spread
throughout tho winter, and at tho
satno tlmo sufficiently low to prevent
its principal natural enemy a min
ute black, four-winged fly from de
veloping, a serious visitation over
largo areas may bo expected.
In all tho states where tho green bug
has mado Its appcaranco grain grow
ers Bhould watch their fields careful
ly. It any spots appear where tho
grain changes from grcon to yellow
In color, thoso should bo plowed un
der a deeply as posslblo and tho
ground harrowed and rolled. It Is
from spots of this character that tlo
grci bug spreads over the remainder
of tho fields. If straw can bo spared
for the purposo, It may bo spread over
tho Infected patches and burned. Thli
destroys tho pest as effectively as tbn
plowing under of tho ground.
Ordinarily, mo groen uug is Kept in
check by the tulnuto fly nlready men
tioned. This parasite lays Us eggs in
tho body of tho green bug, and tho
young, hatching from the eggs within
tho body, ultimately cause tho dcrtli
of tho bug. Theso parasites are found
In a considerable number oi insects
which are closely related to the green
bug. Under favorable tomperturo con
ditions they will probably Incrcaso
until their nmbers arc sufficient to
ovorcomo any material Increase In tho
I numbors of the green bug. They aro

Grand Lodgo nnd tho Medical Asso
ciation an opportunity to attend some
