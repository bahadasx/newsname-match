LONDON WONDERS
AT ITALIAN STAND
Austrian Victory Threatens
Domination of Adriatic
and Italy's Coast
London, Jan. 14.—A wireless
llspatch from Rome, reiterating
the report of an armistice be
tween Austria and Montenegro,
states that it was Austria which
proposed cessation of hostilities,
with the purpose of negotiating a
separate peace.
Vienna, Jan.
14.—The
Cettinjie is a small and unpreten
tious town. It is situated in a narrow
valley at an elevation of 2,000 feet.
London, Jan. 15.—It is authoritative
ly announced today that the reported
offensive of the Teutonic allies
against Saloniki did not occur. Ru
mors that the attack had been begun
against the forces of the allies appar
ently originatejd in the activity of the
French in blowing up the bridges con
necting Saloniki with the road over
•which the attackers would normally
travel.
The rumorB that Austria and Mon
tenegro have suspended hostilities to
discuss arrangements whereby fur
ther warfare on Montenegrin soil
should be stopped may be based on
the fact that the Austrian advance in
Montenegro has become so slow that
suspicion of a suspension of hostilities
is naturally aroused. Many military
critics, however, are of the opinion
that Montengro is now 'u °uch a po
sition that some form of arrangement
with her adversary has become imper-
Speculation is rife as to the attitude
which Italy has adopted with regard
to the Invasion of Montenegro by the
Austrians which constitutes a grave
menace to Italian Interests.
Italy Being Watched.
The fact that Italy's superior fleet
did not prevent an Austrian squadron
harbor of Cattaro, is being commented,
upon and experts suggest that Italy's!
action in the present Juncture should
be awaited before Judgment in passed
News of the developments in the
military operations in Galieia and Bes
sarabia is awaited with much interest.
Beyond a general review ci' the Rus
sian offensive movement, Au'stria gives
today but little light on the happen-
the sole result of the Russian offen
sive to date has been the pushing
back of one Austrian battalion for a
lew hundred yards.
MANY MEN AT SALONIKI.
Berlin, Jan. 14.—Dispatches from
Sofia say that information has been
brought there by a person who left
Saloniki January 8 that the allies con

capture
of Cettinje, capital of Montenegro,
was announced by the war office
today.
The official announcement states:
"The capital of Montenegro is In
our hands. Our troops, pursuing
the beaten enemy, yesterday after
noon entered Cettinje. The resi
dence of the Montenegrin king and
the town are undamaged. The
population is calm."
The fall of Cettinjie before the in
fading Austrian forces, which great
ly outnumber the comparatively small
Montenegrin armies, was regarded as
question of only a short time after
„Jhe capture by the Austrians of Mount
rir v, U)voen. Cettinjie is only six piles
ffiatlBtfonghold.
The present location of the Monten
egrin capital is uncertain, but-it is
assumed the seat of government was
removed to some point in the interior
•when It became apparent that Cet
tinjie was In peril. King Nicholas and
•C, the officials of his government prob
ably have taken refuge in the moun
tains.
With Cettinjie in the hands of the
Austrians, the Montenegrins are hem
med In on almost every side and, un
like the Serbians, have little oppor
tunity to retreat beyond the borders of
their country. It is doubtful whether
they would he able to escape into
northern Albania and should they do
no, they would be opposed by the hos
tile tribes of that region.

London, Jan. 14.—Reuter's Petro
grad correspondent says that Emperor
Nicholas, in an imperial order to the
Russian army and navy on the occa
sion of the Russian New Year's day,
proclaimed that there can be no peace
without victory. The order follows:
"The year 1915 has passed and it
was filled with memorable instances
_r, of sacriflc by my glorious forces. In
a hard struggle with an enemy, strong
I in numbers and rich In all resources,
they have harassed that enemy and
checked his invasion, their breasts
forming an invincible shield of pro
tection for the fatherland.
"On the threshhold of the new year
1916, I send to you my greetings, my
brave warriors. In heart and thought
I am with you while you battle in the
trenches, imploring the aid of the
most high on your work, your valor
and your courage. Remember this:
Our beloved Russia cannot be assured
of her independence and her rights,
cannot enjoy the fruits of her labors
or develop her resources unless a de

It is too grave a responsibility.

EXILE DIES IN UNITED STATES
AFTER FIGHTING OFF DEATH
LONG TIME.
El Paso, Tex., Jan. 14.—Funeral ar
rangements for Gen. Vlctoriano Huer
ta, former provisional president of
Mexico, who died here last night after
a lingering illness, were being com
pleted today.
It is probable, relatives said, that
the veteran Mexican general would be
buried in Mexico, the land of his
birth, and from which he was an exile.
Huerta, once provisional president
of Mexico, was 72 years of age. He
had been ill for nearly, six months, his
Illness first becoming marked soon af
ter his Incarceration as a federal pris
oner at Fort Bliss last July. Attend
ing physicians attributed death to a
complication of complaints, which
caused a general breakdown.
When the general's condition be
came alarming he was transferred
from Fort Bliss to his home in El Paso.
Federal guards were withdrawn and
a $15,000 bond asked by the govern
ment for the appearance of Gen.
Huerta on a charge of violating the
neutrality laws was waived.
Gen. Huerta died in full possession
of his faculties and surrounded by the
members of his family and a number
of close personal friends, most of
whom were members of hiB Btaff, in
the days of former glory.
General Vlctoriano Huerta was a
professional soldier, and as such he
had, up to the overthrow of President
Francisco Madero, been known for his
loyal support of the existing govern
ments. He fought loyally for Presi
dent Porfiro Diaz until his fall, and
when Diaz was no longer chief execu
tive, Huerta fought for Francisco de
la Barra, the provisional president. Af
ter Francisco Madero was elected
Huerta found it to be his duty to sup
port one who had so long fought as
a rebel. His loyalty was not challeng
ed until the Felix Diaz revolution in
Mexico City in February, 1913 when
the Madero government was complete
ly overthrown and Huerta himself ele
vated to the presidency.
Huerta devoted himself to tlie mili
tary career at a very early age. Born
at Chihuahua in 1844, he entered the
military academy of Chapult^pec at
the age of seventeen and passed
through the full course to graduation
in 1875, when hq was commissioned
second lieutenant of engineers. Dur
ing his academic term he was known
for his "predilection for scientific stud
ies, particularly astronomy and math
ematics.
The assassination of President Ma
dero and his brother followed and in
the meantime Huerta, with the mili
tary behind him, had been recognized
as the provisional president.
This crime aroused a storm of indig
nation throughout the United States.
In many quarters there were demands
for Intervention but President Taft,
who was on the eve of leaving office,
decided to take no action which might
commit the incoming administration of
President Wilson.

OF BUTTER MADE

New York, Jan. 14.—As showing the
heavy shipments of food supplies now
being made from this port to Russia, it
was stated that a special train of
twenty cars loaded with butter was

Russia.
The amount of this shipment is un
derstood to have exceeded all records
for a single consignment. This is be
lieved to be the first American made
butter ever shipped to Russia.
Dealers say that America has butter
to spare and that they are anxious to
extend their exports. The report of
the associated warehouses on Jan. 1
showed there were in forty-five lead

Building Companies Submit
Figures on Building of
New Hotel Ottumwa
A large number of bidders have ar
rived here today for the opening of
the bids on the new Hotel Ottumwa
which is to be constructed at Court and
Second streets early this year at an
outlay of nearly $300,000. The meet
I ing of the directors of the hotel com
pany was called at 3:30 in the rooms
of the Commercial association and fol
lowing a secret session of short dura
tion the formal opening of the bids
took place.
Owing to the high bids submitted
I January 5, when eighteen firms offer
ed estimates on the construction and a
great number on the electric wiring of
the proposed building, changes were
made in the plans and specifications
and revised bids ordered. Four of the
firms having lowest bids last week on
the general construction, A. H. Neu
man, Des Moines J. Mardls Co., Des
Moines Bailey-Marsh Co., Minne
apolis, and H. Eilenberger & Co., Chi
cago, were asked to submit bids and
the same courtesy was extended local
bidders.
Early today representatives of sev
eral of the firms bidding on some part
of the hotel work were on the ground
and incoming trains brought others
later in the day. It Is hoped by the
directors to get bids today that will be
within the amount they have fixed as
available for the construction of the
hotel and as this will be the final open
ing of bids on the present plans, an
award is expected to be made soon.
The directors have canvassed the
building proposition from every angle
and have cut out unnecessary parts of
the plans that will not mar the beauty
or detract from the convenience of
the new hotel with a view to reduce
the building cost.
Lessees Warden and Bayfield with
Architect Proudfoot and his electrical
engineer Mr. Sorg, are present at the
opening of the bids. The delayed ar
rival of many of those interested In
the meeting today led to a delay from
the forenoon until afternoon.

OFF STEAMER AND QUESTION
ED AT JAMAICA.
New York, Jan. 14. Albert Clark,
a private in the fifth U. S. infantry,
was removed from the steamship San
ta Marta at Jamaica by a British neu
trality officer, according to passengers
who arrived here today. After being
detained ashore several hours, Clark
was allowed to return to the ship and
proceed here.
This Is said to be the first time a
United States soldier has been remov
ed under similar conditions from an
American vessel since the war of 1812.
Clark, /who had served nineteen
months in the canal zone, was proceed
ing to Washington to report, to the ad
jutant general, and was in full uniform
when he was removed from the Santa
Marta, which flies the American flag.
When the steamer Btopped at Jamai
ca, en route from Colon to New York,
a British neutrality officer boarded the
vessel, and questioned all passengers
as to their nationality. Clark said he
was born near Vienna but had taken
out his first American citizenship
papers some time ago.
The neutrality Officer left the Bhlp
and shortly afterward, passengers said,
three colored soldiers boarded the San
ta Marta and told Clark to accompany
them ashore. Clark said he was close
ly questioned by commanding officers.
While he was absent American pas
sengers on the Santa Marta decided to
appeal to the American consul, but be
fore this could be done, Clark returned.
Clark said he would make a report
of the Incident to the war department.

CONGRESS ASKED
FOR LARCE SUM
Washington, D. C., Jan 14.—A bonus
of at least six months' pay is propos
ed for civilian employes of the gov
ernment working on Panama canal
construction for three years prior to
March 31, 1914, in bills now pending
before congress. More than 5,000 men,
it is estimated, would be benefitted.
The bills call for an appropriation not
to exceed $5,0000,00.
In urging adoption of the proposal
the Panama Canal Employes' associa
tion calls attention to the substantial
rewards voted by congress to army,
navy and marine hospital officers who
served three years or more in the
canal zone and claim that failure to
include civilian employes was uninten
tional and should be corrected.
The basiB of reward contained in
the bills Is two months' pay for every
year of service to all civilians who re
mained at work for three consecutive
years or longer. This would make the
maximum bonus six months' salary.
Only one map out of every seven
civilians it is estimated, remained at
his post for three years.
