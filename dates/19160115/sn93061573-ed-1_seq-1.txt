eblo. Lots Crew at Rate of $150 Per
That, owning property in Clayton
is a lucrative proposition gained
positive credence when the Melton
lots were sold recently to L. A. Wi
kolf for $3,200. These lots were pur
chased eighteen years ago for $500,
an increase of jut $15,0 a year. Mr.

perhaps save folks useless trips to
the court house and peradventure
make it easier on the vocal chords
of the Treasurer's office force.

. Kklund Saloon Closed
The Union county commissioners
are legal representatives of the
county in its dealings with the pub
lic, and necessarily enters into di
vers contracts with citizens in car
rying on the county's business. They
enter into contracts with liquor
dealers, extending to the latter cer
tain privileges and immunities in
consideration of the dealers paying
the county for the privilege and
agreeing to conduct their places ac
cording to law requirements.
The Ekluuil Hotel Har was order
ed closed by the commissioners, the
application for liquor license for
191(5 canceled which had previously
been approved, and a notation enter
ed into the minutes of the commis
sioners to the effect that no liquor
license will be granted Mr. Eklund
or to the Eklund Hotel Ranch and
Irrigation company for one year
from the date of said order. This
action was taken by the commis
sioners not in a retaliatory manner
as is thought by some, perhaps but
because the court believed that
charges were substantiated that the
company had repeatedly violated the
obligations of its contract with the
county, as well as the statutes rel
ative to posting copies of sections
2915 to 2921, inclusive, of the Laws
of New Mexico, in its saloon, which
sections relate to selling or giving
tobacco or liquor to minors gener
allyally; because of the allegation
that intoxicants have been served to
minors outside the bar room and
because minors have been permitted
to loiter in the saloon. The com
pany, according- to transcript, of
criminal docket submitted to the
commissioners by Joseph Gill, has
heretofore entered pleas of guilty
to charges of failure to keep the
laws posted and to permitting minors
to loiter in bar room, and to selling
intoxicants to a minor. Section 2920
of the statutes provides that per
sons who are convicted or plead
guilty to the above offenses shall,
in addition to other penalties, for
feit their license and right to do
business of the nature before men
tioned within the county in which
the offense was committed for the
period of one year.
The Supremo Court of New Mex
ico has passed upon the question
of the authority anil tluty of Coun
ty Commissioners under circum
stances similar to thve under which
the Eklund saloon was closed for
tunately, and held that the com
missioners have no discretion un
der such ' circumstances and must
act, and that they act in a minister
ial capacity in closing up saloons
when the owner has plead guilty or
been convicted of violating the above
mentioned laws.
Tuesday night Sheriff Crumley,
acting by order of the commissioners
court, closed and took charge of the
Eklund saloon, locking and burring
all doors. It is understood that the
company has commenced proceed
ings looking to the re-opening of
its place of business. (

All parents and patrons are very
cordially invited to visit the school
exhibit Friday afternoon, January
21st, when the handicraft of Clay

played. "Parents are invited on this par
ticular day," said Superintendent J.

a chance to compare notes and ob
serve the work being done by the
pupils. Parents are always welcom-:
visitors. Visits are inspirations to
the pupil and on this day teachers
and parents can become better ac
quainted. If teachers and parents
understand each other there is co
operation, hence better results from
the pupil and teachers are like par
ents, they want the student to suc
ceed." School Notes
We have an invitation to join the
State Athletic Association but tho
distance is so great to the meeting
place that we must decline. We will
have a meet of our own in April or
May. We have some good runners
high jumpers and discus throwers.
The history class is just finishing
Greece, the geometry class is finish
ing the fifth book and a new geom
etry class will be started soon. In
the eighth grade, the class will quit
agriculture and review geography.
Since the new year tho attend
ance has greatly increased, and now
the enrollment exceeds the school
census.
The high school attendance would
be almost perfect were it not for
some sickness. . The attendance in
the grades has been excellent. The
tardy cases as well as absences are
made by a few pupils who are kept
unnecessarily for the most part at
home by 'their parents.
