I Submits Poetry For Criticism, and
Another Sends a Threat.
Madison, Wis.Freak letters always
are interesting even though they some
times bring a message of pathos that
gives us pause. Badger executives
seem to be recipients ot an undue pro
portion ot such misbhes, but Governor
Philipp, since he has filled the office,
has sought to read them With consider
ation whenever possible Some of
them, however, are impossible For
instance:
A man up in Clark county says a
widow living next dooi with six chil
dren allows them to stone his cow and
wants the governor to put an end to
such outrages Believing the state al
lows a bounty of 5)500 for birth of trip

four cases of birth of triplets were re
corded and an equal number last
year, while in 1913 there were twelve
such births. The governor referred
the letter to Dr. Harper.
A Milwaukee dentist wants the go^
ernor to collect some of his uncollected
bills. The executive referred him to
the courts for relief.
A chap in New York referred two
poems, one on neutrality and the oth
er on evolution, to Governor Philipp
for "poetic criticism" and such changes
as the governor's poetic mind might
suggest. The latter, it Is understood,
turned them over to his literary ad
viser, Executive Clerk Charles Stew

scholar.
A Mormon from Salt Lake City wast
ed 8 cents in the coin of the realm to
send Wisconsin's political head a copy

The title was "For Our Uncle Sam."
it is understood the governor shifted
the burden of reply on Lawrence
Whittet
"As one of the elect chosen by God,
Jan. 1880, and as a lineal descendant
of Elijah," a Kansan asks that the
mixed marriage law, prohibiting mar
riage of brothers and sisters, fathers
and daughters and sons and mothers,
be repealed and that the governor give
his aid to the movement. He says he
has written about twenty governors,
whom he specified, asking for their co
operation. He also sent his message
to McKinley, Roosevelt, Taft and Wil
son and complains they withheld their
co-operation. He says this marriage
law is responsible for the war in Eu
rope, which is a case of God visiting
bis punishment upon mankind for cre
ating such statutes for man to observe.
A lunatic in an asylum wrote that If
they let bim out he will be able to ex
pose a score of murderers.
A blackmailer's letter threatened the
governor if he did not do certain things
and hinted at a "box" to be left in the
executive office. The governor answer
ed that he would be prepared for the
mysterious box and intimated that un
doubtedly it would contain nitroglyc
erin He thanked the crank for his
advance warning, which gave him op
portunity for preparation for the high
er life The letter was turned over to
the authorities.

INDIANS GOOD FARMERS.
Developed as Such More Last Year
Than Ever Before.
Washington.The development of
agriculture and stock raising among
the Indians has been greater In the
last year than ever before, according
to the annual report of Cato Sells, com
missioner of Indian affairs Love of
home and domestic happiness are be
coming at last a more marked trait of
the Indian. A special effort is being
made to better the condition of the
Papago Indians, who are in southern
Arizona. The children are to be
taught the A C's.
"The Papagos." says the commission
er, "are among the most deserving of
any people I have ever*known. Their
home for more than 200 years has
been in the driest desert in the United
States.
"Under these circumstances they
have demonstrated that the genius of
necessity works out wonderful things
The Papagos have made their strug
gle unassisted, and their accomplish
ments, in view of their tremendous ob
stacles, are marvelous."
MEDAL FOR OBSTINACY.
Two Farmers Are Entered In the Con
test In Kansas.
Kansas City.Two of the most con
trary men in Kansas are boasted by
Smith Center. Last fall one man re
fused to pay the price asked by corn
huskers and vowed he would let his
field rot before he would yield
Now the field, containing about 2,000
bushels of grain, still stands and is
grown up with a dense crop of sun
flowers.
The other contrary man is a neigh
bor of the first He husked 1,000 bush
els of his crop, stored it in an uncov
ered crib and said it would remain
there till it brought him 75 cents a
bushel. It is still there, but ruined bv
the season's heavy rains
FARMER'S IDEA SAVES
HIM TIME AND MONEY
Uses Pipe to SendWheat From
Plateau to Market.
Wenatchee, Wash.Instead of haul
ing his wheat eighteen miles over a
bad road, as he did formerly, James
Ktane of Rock Island is now letting
the grain slide into market through a
galvanized iron pipe. The former
method cost from 15 to 20 cents a
bushel to market By this latter way
the grain can be handled for 2 cents
a bushel.
The new system has been in opera
tion for a couple of years and bids fair
to continue, at least until the natural
law of gravitation is abolished.
Keane owns land which lies on a
large plateau over 2,000 feet above the
little town of Rock Island. It has al
ways been expensive for the farmer
to drive a long distance to get off the
plateau and back into town, and as
the road wound around the side of the
bluffs it was very rocky and danger
ous.
Two years ago the iron pipe idea
came to Keane. He purchased and in
stalled 2,500 feet of two inch galvaniz
ed iron piping, and the saving the first
year paid for it. The pipe runs from
Keane's west field down a steep hill to
within 400 feet of the warehouse in
the town.
When he wishes to take two or three
loads of wheat to market the grain is
poured into a large sheet iron hopper
fitted over the top of the iron pipe line.
The grain runs along merrily through
the pipe to the town, where it is receiv
ed at the rate of about a sack a min
ute, which is as fast as it can be han
dled.
To save more time and money Keane
has attached an apparatus known as
the "sacker" from a thrashing machine
to the town end of the pipe line,
which automatically receives, sacks
and weighs the grain. A man does the
sewing.
Keane has a monopoly on the big
plateau, which embraces about 5,000
acres of tillable land.0 Last year he
planted most of It and harvested near
ly 100,000 bushels of wheat
The land lies exposed to the periodi
cally hard winds that frequent this
part of the state during the summer,
and there have been years when1
part
of the wheat crop would be piled in
high drifts of dirt When the season
is favorable few farmers are more
handily located than Keane, with his
pipe line marketing method.
SILVER DOLLARS BY MAIL.
Ten, Sent One Year Apart, Have Gone
Through Without Fail.
Federalsburg, Md.About ten yearn
ago Henry P. Wright of Aberdeen be
gan sending to his sister here, Mrs.
Mary Fleetwood, a silver dollar through
the mail as a Christmas present
Recently the annual dollar arrived,
with Mrs. Fleetwood's address on one
side and a two cent stamp on the oth
er. In the ten years that Wright has
been sending these unique remem
brances to his sister not one has been
lost or stolen, neither has it failed to
arrive on time.
Heifers Chase Rabbits.
Pennsburg, Pa.If a new idea of a
Snmneytown farmer becomes a fad the
rabbit dog may be pushed into the
background. He has trained some of
his heifers to scent and chase rabbits
with as much success as dogs and.
Indeed, move cheaply.
IN FAVOR OF CONSCRIPTION.!
America Should Adopt System, Says
Harriot Stanton Blatch.
Washington.Mrs. Harriot Stanton
Blatch, president of the Woman's Po
litical union, favors conscription. She
says:
"I am of the opinion that America
should adopt the only democratic na
tional defense possibleconscription.
"I would have conscription on a plan
somewhat similar to that enforced In
Switzerland at the present timean
enlistment of two months at first, to
continue for shorter periods each year
a system that would harmonize all
sections of our country. In my opin
ion we want to be made a much more
homogeneous people, and therefore
those that enlist_frqnijhe east should
be sent to the west and those from the
south sent to the north, and a perfect
understanding would be brought about
between various sections.
"This conscription imposed upon men
should also be obligatory for women,
who as citizens, but not as soldiers,
should know how to efficiently do their
share in coming to the aid of their
country in time of calamity.
"Girls should be forced to train in
various departments of the civil serv
ice, in the postoffices, in all the mu
nicipal departments, and to women I
would apply the same ideas as to the
menthat is to say, send them to va
rious parts of the country, so that they
may get a wider knowledge of their
home land."
CHASED 20 CENTS 20 YEARS.
That
Tells Court Bank Owes Him
Sum Since 1895.
St. Louis. A claim of 20 cents
against the Mullanphy bank was pre
sented in Circuit Judge Kinney's court
by Gottlieb Kling, who declared that
the money had been due him since the
bank went into the hands of a receiver
in 1895.
United States Senator Stone, receiv

to claims presented in order to make
a final settlement. Three claimants
appeared. They were Kling, Mrs. Chris

Carlisle, Pa.When one realizes that
if a Chippewa Indian boy has to ask
his mother for a piece of Dah-tah-me-
she-me-bah-ske-ne-si-gah- ne- we ko- be-

many of the Indian students at the
Carlisle school are really not so bur

Among names on the Carlisle roster
of students are such as Katie Owns

Frank Smells-the-log, Edward Dis

Flora Well-known and Henry Knocks

The longest name on Carlisle's list
of students is Owen Woothtakewabit

That odd names have not entirely
passed away is evidenced, for instance,
by the following names taken off the
students' roll, being surnames, having
reference to parts of the human body:
No-shin-bone, Spread-handa, Short

ST. PAUL AM MINNEAPOLIS. MINN.. SATURDAY: JANUAR* 15,1916.
GYPSY BANDMADE
GIRL, 16. A SLAVE
Was Sold to Rovers When Her
Mother Died Nine Years Ago.
RETURNS TO HER FATHER
Escaped After Extensive Traveling
and Was Caught by ^Oakland Au
thorities, Who Acted on Her Story.
Taken From Orphans' Home by
Gypsies, Who Gave Fictitious Names.
Helena,. MontWhen Evelyn Mitch
ell, a sixteen year old girl, who for
nine years has been the slave of gypsy
bands in this country and the old
world, threw herself into the arms of
her father, a ranchman residing near a
Montana town, it was the first time
either had set eyes upon the other
since the day of the mother's funeral
in Helena nearly ten years ago. M. L.
Rickman, secretary of the state bureau
of child and animal protection, escort
ed the girl to the ranch from Glacier
park, where he met her in charge of
Miss Georgiana Allen^ a Havre school
teacher, who agreed to chaperon the
girl to Montana from a house of de
tention in Oakland, Cal.
H. A. Davee, state superintendent of
public instruction, who was attending
the National Teachers^association, was
besought by the Oakland authorities
to provide escort for'the girl back to
Montana. The city paid her expenses.
Superintendent Davee learned that
Miss Allen, a teacher, was shortly to
come home, and the latter went to the
house of detention, where the girl has
been kept two months to guard her
against kidnaping by the gypsy band
from which she was taken.
There arrangements were made for
bringing her home, and the teacher and
the girl departed secretly from San
I Francisco, embarking on a steamer for
Astoria, from which point they went
by train to Glacier park.
The necessity for keeping their
whereabouts secret was urged by the
girl, who was in terror of being seized
by the band
The history of the young woman
reads like a romance For several
years she has been trying to escape
from the -gypsies buc aloVe and friend
less, she was given no opportunity un
til abdut three months ago. when the
Oakland officials secured possession of
her after a desperate fight in the
courts The Marino band, to which
she was sold for $2,000 in 1912, is rich,
and money was spent lavishly to de
feat justice.
About ten years ago, following the
funeral of the mother, the girl and a
sister were placed in an orphans'
home. There they remained for per
haps six months, when Evelyn was
taken to Butte and in Judge Donlan's
court upon the representations of an
attorney adoption papers were made
out for "Mary" Mitchell, placing her
in charge of a couple named Gichi. It
developed later that the Gichis were
members of a gypsy band.
Evelyn was an attractive little girl,
and she was soon dressed in rags and
started out as a beggar. Her pretty
face and sad eyes affected the chari
tably disposed, and her collections
were not the least of the loot of the
band
As the girl grew older she longed for
a return to "American life," as she
called it. Living in wagons or tents
along the highways, half starved and
beaten by the Gichi couple whenever
she did not bring home as much
money as they considered adequate
her existence was unhappy.
Recently the girl escaped from the
hand after extensive traveling and
was picked up by the Oakland author!
ties on complaint of the Marino gyp
sies, and thus she was given an oppor
tunity to tell her story in court As a
result she was consigned to the care
of Matron Rich of the Oakland Deten

PRAISE IN GERMANY
Appreciation Shown-For Her
Efforts In Feeding Aliens.
Berlin.Mrs. Gerard, wife of the
American ambassador here, is appeal
ing to her friends at home for funds
to carry on the American relief kitch
en of Berlin, which has daily fed borne
200 women and children, the families
of men who are aliens in Germany and
therefore placed in concentration
camps, following the action which
Great Britain and France took in the
internment of aliens iu those countries.
The American Association of Com
merce and Trade Berlin gave the
money to ran the kitchen for six
months when its doors were opened
last year in the quaint little building
in the Schlesische strasge, where Mrs.
Gerard and her committee of Ameri
can ladies found an unoccupied house
in the factory, district of the east side.
Mrs. Gerard herself gave the coal sup
ply for the winter, so that the place
was kept open all afternoon, many of
the women and children having no
other place where they could keep
warm. The money was spent so eco
nomically that $1 furnished seven
wholesome meals
This winter the enterprise is without
funds, and the doors of the American
relief kitchen have not been opened to
the'crowds of hungry, poorly clad wo
men with babies in their arms and
clinging to their skirts who mournful
ly stand around and gaze through the
windows.
Long purses and generous ones
among the American colony have been
taxed to the utmost by the chanty
needs arising from the war, and Mrs.
Gerard has won appreciation not only
in Berlin, but throughout Germany tor
her large contributions of money and
the devotion of almost all of her time
to the alleviation: of distress. On Nov.
11 the German government sent her
Red Cross decorations of the first and
second class to commemorate her serv
ices in connection with the effort to
help German prisoners of war in Rus

GOLDEN WEDDING PAIrt
RETURNTO OLD HOME
Names Carved When Sweet
hearts Still Remain.
Peabody, Kan.For their golden
wedding Mr. and Mrs. A. S. Lowther of
this city went back to their old home In
the West Virginia hills, which they had
not visited since they were married,
fifty years ago.
They joined the trek to the Kansas
prairies before the Santa Fe railroad
ran further west than Emporia, and the
trip to Marion county was made in a
prairie schooner. Here the Lowthers
took up a homestead and lived, rearing
eleven children, eight boys and three
girls, and in all that time they never
went back to their old home in Richie
county, not even to visit
But for the fiftieth anniversary of
their marriage Mr. and Mrs. Lowther
decided to return to their old home
They were sweethearts when the civil
war broke out. For four years the
West Virginian wore the blue uniform
of the federals. When peace was de
clared he went back home, back to his
sweetheart who had waited for him.
The trip to the altar followed And
later they came west.
Writing from West Virginia to her
son Mort of Peabody the other day,
Mrs. Lowther said everything had
changed back there. Even the hills had
got higher than fifty years ago. But
the old log cabin in which she was
reared was still there, and so were the
old well, the old oaken bucket and the
initials of herself 'and Mr. Lowther
which had been carved fifty years ago.

The kind of chicken that ultimately

Washington.It's a sweet little job,
these days, being private and personal
physician to the president of the Unit
ed States From a medical viewpoint
it's not a particularly trying post, but
the position embraces about fifty-seven
other tasks, all calling for the tact,
memory and general ability of a cor

Slipping in and out of the White

cisive eye and manner of speech, but
withal an affability of manner which
immediately attracts attention, can
often be seen these days. His name is

means he is a member of the medical
corps of the navy.
Grayson is the man who brought the
position of piesidential doctor* out of
obscurity and elevated it to a post of
honor, dignity and efficiency in White
House circles. Before Grayson came a
White House doctor was a mysterious
personage, little known and less cared
about Grayson combines this position
with the one left vacant by the late
Major Archibald Butt and fills both
with complete satisfaction
On the whole, the practice of medi

States is the least of Grayson's tasks.
He's a sort of confidential family ad

regulates the president's office hours
and sometimes his statements to re

times the sole connecting link between
the head of the American nation and
the representatives of the American
press.
In more ways than one this black
haired, pleasant faced, affable man
nered, efficient man has attained dis
tinction and a record during the time
Woodrow Wilson has occupied the
White House. He is usually spoken
of as "Dr. Cary T. Grayson. U. S. N.,
the president's personal physician," but
that's merely the correspondents' meth
od of repaying In formality the in
formal, gracious kindnesses of the
president's doctor.
In size Grayson is a small man, but
that doesn't apply to his ability. He
has a long, straight nose, jet black
hair and deep set eyes that twinkle
with humorous appreciation half the
time. Sometimes they don't twinkle,
but that's when Grayson is "on the
road" with his distinguished patient,
and the responsibility of his position at
such a time is apt to take the twinkle
from any one's eyes
The president is an indefatigable
worker, and like all men of his tem
perament he has the habit of neglect
ing his personal health when Involved
in a deep and delicate problem Gray
son, however, is always hovering in
the background, guarding him against
overwork, driving him forth to the
golf links or for an automobile ride,
urging plenty of sleep, a careful diet
and all the other details necessary to
a president's health
These are a part of his duties when
the president is at home Grayson's
duties at such times become compara
tively light, and he Is enabled to take
up his other work at the Naval hos
pital at Washington-, where he has a
regular quota of patients who demand
his attention so long as he remains in
the city.
But when the president takes to his
private car for a swift whtrl to New'
York, to Cornish or elsewhere. Gray
son suddenly stands forth as the czar gg
of the executive's private car. Gray
son is strong on the point of exercise
He insists that the president take ex
ercise at any and all times, and the
president, fortunately, when the mat
ter Is brought to his attention, is al-
&k f"*f* ^willing to exercise, ^.%mi
