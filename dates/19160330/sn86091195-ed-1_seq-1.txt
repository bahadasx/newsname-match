Modern Methods of
Gardening.
„ T,ie Seed-Tape method marks
the greatest improvement gardening
has ever seen. Specially selected seeds,
accurately spaced in a" fertilized paper
tape. You plant the tape, a whole row
at a time. The seeds are better—the
results are better—and the backaches
and drudgery of gardening are en
tirely eliminated. With Seedtape von
can plant in one hour what would
ordinarily require all dav and with it
amateurs get as good results as ex
perts.
This method is endorsed bv the best
seed experts and Agricultural Colleges
of the land.
Believing the Blackfoot public would
be interested in this improved method
of gardening, we have taken the ag
enev for Seed-Tape seeds. You are
cordially invited to call and examine
these seeds and note the display at
our store. '

Give Us a Chance
In an article taken from the Chica

Theatricals," we observed that "The
Graces of Musical Comedy" would
make a few stops before opening their
engagement in San Francisco. Why
can't we have this company stop one
night with us I They surely must
have a first-class company to contem
plate an extended run in the western
metropolis. ■ Such a company would
be a relief from some of those that
we get occasionally. Give us a chance.

pany and they will present two of
their best bills here in .the Orpheum

A meeting of the business men of
Blackfoot was called this afternoon
by F. N. Parkinson and W. P. Low
man ami about twenty-five"espomied
to the call.
The object of the meeting was to

to the advisabilit}- of constructing a
new hotel, and to ascertain what finan
cial backing they would give the pro
position. Prior to the meeting it was
stated that $10,000 hail been sub
scribed, when the Hon. P. G. Johnston

subscribed be doubled. The motion
was seconded by G. F. Gagon, and was
unanimously carried.

of the hotel proposition by promising
to subscribe two dollars for every one
that was subscribed by present or fu
ture subscribers.
TJie Graces of
Musical Comedy
Has been secured for Wednesday and
Thursday, April 5 and 6 at the Orph
eum. This is a fortunate booking for
Manager Boyd and one worthy of spe
cial notice, as the attraction is to be
seen in but very few one night stands
this season, its time having been al
most entirely booked in the larger
cities of the country. This is strong
evidence of the strength of the com
pany. The opening bill will be ''A
Prince For A Day" and the second
night a selection will be made by the
management from their long list of
successes. a dv.

news of the death of a younger brother
who died in Jennings, Kan., on the
18th inst. Deceased Was 65 years of
age, and his death was caused by

A Show Worth
While
The billing for A Prince For
a Day is upon the boards an
nouncing their appearance at the
Orpheum for April 5th and 6th.
This is the largest traveling pop
star priced musical comedy or
ganisation on the road today,
and present the liveliest kind of
a performance with a change of
bill every day. ..''A laugh a
minute" is promised with this
show. Throughout the humorous
situations, ..is ..seen a constant
vision of alluring eyes and be
witching smiles of a score of
dancing dolls, in an endless num
ber of handsome costume chang
es, that form a kaleidoscopic dis
play of color and beauty. It is
the kind of an entertainment
where thoughts of the morrow
are brushed aside, and those of
yesterdaylaid away and the plea
sures and laughs of the present
day only hold away. The popu
larity of this class of perform
ance is easily proved by the mam
moth business of this company
everywhere, and the management
easily predicts house capacity
here, as well. Those that are
wise, are now getting their seats
well in advance. The prices for
the engagement here will be 50
cents, 75 cents and $1.00 which
is absolutely a painless price for
an attraction of this character.
