Paris Statement Asserts the
Enemy's Night Assaults
Without Success.
Berlin. 31 arch 30, (via London,
8:15 1'. hi.) The repulse (if repeat
ed ul tacks by the French in ef
forts to recapture positions they
had lost in the vtood northwest of
Avocourt is announced Today by
the Gentian army headquarters
Ktaff.
Paris, March 30, (12 noon.) Several
Gerrnau infantry attacks upon Avo
court wood, in an endeavor to retake
lost positions, were made last night.
The war office report of this afternoon
says these assaults failed. No further
advances against Malancourt were at
tempted by the Germans. East of the
Meuse there was heavy artillery fight
ing. The statement follows:
"To the south of the river Somme,
the way having been prepared by a
violent bombardment, the enemy pen
etrated one of the advanced points of
our line at a point to the west of Ver
mandovillers, to the north of Chaul
nes. A counter-attack drove them out.
"To the west of the river Meuse, the
Germans last night delivered several
counter attacks against our positions
in the wood of Avocourt. All these
assaults, however, were driven back
with heavy losses in the ranks of the
enemy. Before the redoubt of Avo
court, the Germans left piles of dead
bodies. There has been no military en
deavor in the region of Malancourt.
"To the east of the river Meuse and
in the Woevre district there has been
intermittent bombardment.
"During the day of March 29 our
aerial attack squardons threw bombs
on the railroad stations of Metz,
Pagny-Sur-Moselle and Maizieres-Les-Metz."
To End Wax by Christmas.
London, March 30. Before the end
of June the allied armies will strike
simultaneous blows on all fronts, de
signed to bring the kaiser to Ids'
knees and end of the war before
Christmas.
This combined offensive, it was held
in London yesterday, is the certain re
sult of the great war council of the
allies which closed at Paris last night.
The allied drives may be preceded
by other German attempts to break
the western front, it is believed. There
are persistent rumors that the Ger
mans have used the long lull at Ver
dun to shift troops for a blow at some
Eector of the French front.
British Forces Relieve French.
"The official communications having
revealed the fact that the British arm
ies have taken over a length of the
line previously held by the French,"
says Keuter's correspondent at the
British headquarters in France, "I am
permitted to make reference to it.
"The new dispositions were carried
out with great skill and secrecy, and
the result has been the release of large
French forces who were manifestly of
great value in another area. At pres
ent the British probably are holding
something like one-fourth of the en
tire length of the western .front, ex
tending in an unbroken line from the
Yser to the Somme.
"Although the hour of the British
army may be at hand, it is not yet. Nor
is there any reason to believe that the
Germans will succeed by their attacks
on Verdun in upsetting the prear
ranged strategy of the great coming
offensive."

NEW DEMAND
OF RAILROAD
MEN OFFERED
Representatives of 400,000
Trainmen Make Offer
to 458 Roads.
8-HOUR DAY WANTED
Employes Also Ask for Over
time Increase Give the
Companies 30 Days.
Chicago, March 30. Representatives
of 400,000 railroad employes are to
present to the management of the
countrys 458 railroads at noon today,
demands for an eight hour day and
time and a half for overtime for all
train service, employes other than the
crews of passenger trains. The lat
ter are excepted because the last arbi
tration of railroad wage disputes pro
vided terms which made the workday
for that class of employes substantially
6 hours and 40 minutes.
Four big organizations the Broth
erhood of Locomotive Engineers, the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen
and Enginemen, the Brotherhood of
Railroad Trainmen and the Order of
Railway Conductors acted in concert
in formulating and presenting the de
mands. The roads are given 30 days
in which to reply and it was generally
understood that most of them would
take advantage of the full time.
3Iay Fropose Arbitration.
It Is thought probable that the em
ployers then wiiV-pKl(o"ilfratton
of the demands. The roads have al
ready indicated this course in public
statements which claim that to grant
the demands would merely mean a flat
increase in wages rather than the
changed working conditions which the
men insist is the object of their nego
tiations. A committee representing each of
the four organizations of employes
will call on the officials of each rail
road and formally present their de7
niands.
One hundred and eighty railway sys
tems with 248,000 miles of right of
way exclusive of terminals and yards
are involved. In the western territory
there are 100 railroads with 138,000
mileage, in the eastern territory 69
railroads with 63,000 mileage and in
the southeastern territory 20 railroads
with 47,000 mileage.
Roads Have Tentative Answer.
New York, March 30. It is under
stood that the railroads have made
i ready a tentative answer to the men's
demands which amounts to a condi
tional refusal that leaves the way open
for further negotiations. The demands
of the men went to the Wheeling and
Lake Edie railroad yesterday and the
eight hour day proposal was refused.
A statement by the executive com
mittee of the men's adjustment boards
says :
"In making the demand for the eight
hour day, thtj unions feel themselves
justified, believing that trains can be
so managed that the 100 miles re
quired of a railroad man per day can
be put Inside of eight hours, as the
train service is now, single crew en
gines in the switching service, on
which only one crew works in the 24,
are often compelled to work from 10
to 16 hours a day. It is injustice such
as this that the railway unions want
ended.
'ot Strike Tactics.
"We will submit our demands all
over the United States. Then we will
attend to our regular routine work un
til the end of 30 days given the rail
roads to consider our demands, when
we will return to receive the reply of
the railroad companies. We will ask
the general managers to discuss the
agers committees, uur uesire is to
open negotiations with the railroads
in our demands, and we have no in
tention of talking strike to the rail
roads or submitting an ultimatum."
Eastern railroad managers replied
today to the demands of their em
ployes for an eight-hour day and high
er rates for overtime work by sub
mitting propositions of their own for
discussion. The demands of the em
ployes are not refused, neither is a
demand made by the railroad man
agers for the acceptance of their pro
posals. These are submitted for con
sideration in the negotiations ex
pected to follow.
"What the railroads ask for Is an
open door," their reply states.
The reply was sent today to the offi
cials of the four brotherhoods immed
iately after receipt of the employes' i
demands. I
Many Killed, Scores Injured, When
Attempt to
Fix Blame in
WreckProbe
Cleveland, Ohio, March 30. Full
toll of the railroad wreck at Amherst,
early yesterday morning, cannot be
known for several days, say surgeons
attending the victims, but is is certain
to exceed 27, the present figure. Two
of the injured, Albert Keller, Chicago
and Wilbur Mahoney, Toledo, cannot
survive.
Hospital surgeons refused to dis
cuss the probable ultimate death, list,
saying that it would certainly be sev
eral hours, possibly days before the
extent of internal injuries suffered by
many could be determined.
Construction of "Death Coach."
The question of whether the so
called "death coach" on the train. No.
86, was of modern steel construction,
as claimed oy New York Central offi
cials or was mainly of wood construc
tion, promised to be an important fea
ture of the investigation.
Railroad officials today were still di
vided in opinion as to whether the
blame should be placed on the tower
man who, it is alleged by some officials
was asleep and failed to give the prop
er signal or upon the engineer, who
they say it may be shown either failed
to see the signal or exceeded his or
ders. The two men at whom most of the
questions were to be directed at to
day's investigation to be held in the
offices of Division Superintendent W.
F. Shaff, were Engineer Herman Hess
of the second section of train No. 86,
and Towerman A. R. Ernst of Am
herst Engineer D. W. Leonard of the first
section of train No. 86, which pulled
the "death car," asserts he stopped his
train on a signal originating in Ernst's
tower.
The engineer declares he saw no sig
nal when he brought his section boom
ing along at 50 miles an hour about
three minutes later.
Ernst asserts he set no stop signal,
declaring the line was open for Engi
neer Leonard to go ahead.
If Ernst is held culpable in the in
vestigation the blame will trace back
to a baby's tiny crib in the Ernst home
at Elyria. The baby waa born Sunday
night. Since that time Ernst has had
little sleep, railroad officials say.
Towerman Shifts Blame,
Ernst, the towerman, early today
made a statement in which he stoutly
denied that he was asleep or that he
was incapacitated by loss of Bleep.
He asserted that he set the signat
properly but that 1t failed to work and
that the accident was caused thereby.
"While my wife was ill," said Erns'..
"I got my regular sleep and went
about my duties as usual. The signal
simply failed to work. That ia all."

Trains Crash on
More Proof
in Sub Issue
Being Taken
Washington, March 30. The United
States government today was using
every means at its command to secure
conclusive proof regarding the disas
ters which have overtaken the Sussex
and other unarmed merchant ships all
carrying American citizens.
All circumstantial evidence indi
cates that these ships were torpedoed
without warning and that the German
submarines have begun an underwater
campaign in violation of Germany's
recent assurances to the United States.
Some of this credits the suggestion
that German submarines are acting
under secret instructions, such as were
advocated by Admiral Von Tirpitz, to
torpedo every vessel approaching the
British Isles. Some officials believe
that the German commanders have ofc
ders other than those of which this
country is advised.
The United States, it is stated author
itatively, has determined upon the next
step. Unless Germany' makes some
statement in reply to inquiries made
by this country, to cause the state de
partment touching its present inten
tions, recent aggravating incidents will
be combined into one general indict
ment which will make the issue clear
cut. Should Germany disclaim respon
sibility for the disasters, the United
States will continue investigations. If
conclusive proof, that the ships were
torpedoed without warning, is secured
the United States probably would act
promptly.
A dispatch from Ambassador Gerard,
who has been instructed to make in

Thirty persons were killed and
scores were injured in the Lake Shore
train wreck at Amherst, Ohio, early
yvednesday morning. These pictures,
showing the effects of the disaster,
were taken Wednesday forenoon, be
fore any of the debris had been
cleared away.
The wreck was one of those rarest
of railroad calamities not one colis
ion, but two, involving three trains,
on two tracks. When the half dozen
investigations now under way are con
cluded, the blame will be fixed on
some luckless railroad employee. A
block signal, set suddenly and with
out warning, against a train speed
ing along eastward with another
train following in the next "block"
lies at the bottom of the doubt that
exists as to the real cause of the
MISSING LINK IN
MURDER SOUGHT
Chain of Evidence Attached to Dr.
Waite Is Broken by Absence
of Undertaker Kane,
New York, Match 30. One import
ant witness desired by the district atj
torney to complete the chain of evi
dence in the Peck murder case was
still missing early today. He is
Eugene O. Kane, the embalmer who,
according to Dr. Arthur Warren
Waite, accepted $9,000 in cash, as
part payment of $25,000, Waite was
to have given him for swearing that
he used arsenic in embalming tha
body of Waite's wealthy father-in-law,
f John E. Peck of Grand Rapids. Dr.
Waite is still at Bellevue hospital un
der arrest charged with the crime.
Physicians said today that he prob
ably would be well enough to leave
the hospital by Monday.
Waite's attorney, Walter R. Duel,
now insists his client had no inten
tion of laying the ground work for an
insanity plea when he told the dis
trict attorney than an evil spirit
which he called "The Man from
Egypt" poisoned Mr. Peck and his
wife.
Circulars bearing the photograph
and description of Kane were sent
broadcast from headquarters today on
the instructions of the district at

at Kane's house but he did not return
home. Mrs. Kane said she expected

ELUDES FOES
ON HIS TRAIL
Military Authorities Believe
Outlaw Has Success
fully Escaped.
SECRET AGENTS ACT
Department Justice Scents
Plot Americans Are .
Aiding Villa?
Washington, 3Iarch 30. Depart
ment of justice agents, following a
trail which is said to lead to Amer
ican sources of supply for Villa,
have uncovered evidence in New
York and other cities which they
believe when fully developed will
justify the charge.
The allegation often made that
Villa has received aid from Ger
man sources also Is being investi
gated but no indication has been
given as to whether any evidence
has been fonnd.
The department Is disinclined to
act on its evidence that American
money and supplies have gone to
Villa while it is in the stage that
will involve only subordinates. It
intends to pursue the trail if pos
sible to the men higher np.
El Paso, March 30 Brigadier Gen
eral Pershing has projected a long and:
relentless hunt for Francisco Villa a
chase that may last for many weeks
before the bandit is run to earth. This
information was gleaned here today
who made no secret
of their belief that Villa had slipped
through the cordon of Carranza forces
and American troops.
Mexican officials said today they had
no news as to the whereabouts of Villa,
but that the troops of the de facto gov
ernment were aiding the American
soldiers In trying to round up the
brigand. The last of the information
was that Villa was moving through the
Santa Maria valley. Once among his
peon friends, who would give the
American troop3 misleading informa
tion regarding his whereabouts, Villa
might escape detection for a long
time.
fieward Would "Get Villa."
Ranchers from the region west of
Chihuahua City said that when it be
came known that there was a price
upon Villa's head, dead or alive, the
bandit would be in constant danger of
betrayal. Whether the American
troops have made known their dis
regard for Villa is not known here buf.
it is presumed the word has spread
out among the peon population as the
American soldiers move from place to
place.
Roving bands of Villa men are re
ported everywhere in the region of
Santa Maria valley but apparently the
American flying columns have .not
come in contact with them.
Await Supply Order.
Brigadier General George Bell, com
mander of the base at Fort Bliss,
awaited official orders today to ship
supplies to the army over the Mexico
Northwestern railroad. Supplies con7
sisting of gasoline, forage, canned
goods and flour will go forward as
soon as the orders are received.
Meanwhile Major Elliot, department
quartermaster, is moving supplies in
great bulk to Columbus, X. M., where
they are carried in truck trains over
the Mexican desert to the army base
below Casas Grandes. Ten carloads
were shipped to Columbus early today
while 10 motor trucks were also sent
to the army base there. Twenty-seven
more motor trucks will go forward
late today to Columbus.
