ListWiFirfit
Under tbe above heading the
undersigned plans writing a se
ries of articles, and, with the Ed
itor's permission publishing them
in the Watauga Democrat, the ar
ticles commemorating the lives
of some of the pioneers of the
county or those who, later on,
helped develop the resources,
trhose descendents not only "rise
up and call them blessed" but
have taken up and are carrying
on the work laid down by these
builders of our country, these
makers of local history, and
though your correspondent reali
ses the largeness of the task and
. lays no claim to literary merit,
yet does claim to be as good a
friend of the old community as
any one who has known it for on-
' ly a quarter of a century and who
has lived within its borders a lit
tle less than a decade and a half.
Too frequently occurs thart
when a member of the communi
ty takes his departure therefrom,
either to pitch his cent amid com
parative strangers to seek his
fortune among entire strangers
in the far western country, he
drops out of the life of the com
munity in which, perhaps, he had
spent all of his younger days, the
old home a silent witness of by
gone, open-door welcome to the
passing traveler or the centre of
community uplift and enlighten
ment, the surrounding country
rapidly rapidly being transform
ed under the seemingly heartless
hand of progress, meanwhile the
once big man in the old commu
nity, dwindling down to the size
of a little-known hero of ancient
times.
Fortoo often is it so with our
friends and one-time conspicu
ous who "pull up stakes" on
Earth's grassy plains, traverse
tbe "Valley of the Shadow,"
"cross the River Silence," and
"pitch their tents" on the "sweet
and blessed country, the home of
God's elect." And surely it is not
enough to keep green the little
mound in God's half Here on the
hillside or to replace with fresh
ones the withering flowers upon
that grass mound, nor yet to
erect over the spot where we laid
to rest the tired body of our
friend, a shaft of stone and, upon
cold marble, in choice language
indelibly carve a sentiment which
"to tbe living would mean more
. than to the dead." Rather let us,
about the fireside, talk of absent
ones as if they were upon a jour
ney, prolonged beyond a reason
able time, it is true, but a jour
ney, for all that, with eager ex
pectation looking forward to our
joining them at some stage of
the journey, meanwhile keeping
in mind and helping the comma
nity to keep in mind the fact
that, as the Master said at the
bed-side of a friend "She is not
dead but Bleepeth."
Let me close my introductory
remarks with tbe beautiful little
poem, copied from a paper, the
author's name not given, the ti
tie "Before it is too Late:"
If yooY'e a tender metaage
ur a loving
word to sy,
Don't wait till you forget it.
Bnt whispor it t?day.
We live bnt In the present.
The future le unknown
The morrow It a myatery,
, To.day Ii oor own.
Tbe tender words unspoken,
Tbe letter never aent,
. The !onffforgotten nieeoage.
Tbe wealth of love nnapent.
, For these some hearts are breaking;
. . For these some loved nnea wait.
So show them that you care for
them,
' Before It is too late.

FOR FLETCHER'S.'
CASTOR;! A
PASSING OF A GOOD WOMAN.
Margaret Campbell Floyd Aa Apprt
ciatioa. James Wilson iu Statesville Land
mark. Few who read thiscommunica
tion will remember her whose
name appears in the heading of
this article. She was born a lit
tle over 85 years ago, north of
Statesville, near Trinity church,
and has been gone so long from
her native community and home
people, that most of those who
knew her and were intimately as
sociated with her during her
young life, have passed away,
and her name and face have fa
ded away from the memory of
most of the few who still live.
But she has not been entirely for
gotten. "The righteous shall be
in everlasting remembrance1"
More than 50 years ago, as an
orphan boy, I lived in the home
of her father, and it was there
that I first came to know and to
esteem her highly as a Christian
woman. Tbe old home where she
first lived and was reared has
mouldered into dust and vanish
ed. Not one stone or piece of
timber is left upon another to
mark the spot where she lived.
Only last year I rode rapidly by
the old place in an automobile
and did not know it. But the
name and faca of this good . wo
man, and others who lived there
have not faded away. They are
resh on the page of the tablet of
memory, lean never forget them.
Though dead they still live and
speak to me.
Miss Margaret was one of the
daughters of the late Col. Milton
Campbell, one of the most highly
respected and honored citizens of
redell county, who lived about
seven miles north of Statesville
She was a bright young woman
and was educated in the best
schools of her day. Her fine men
tal endowment fitted her for a
higher order of life. Later she
was married to Rev. John W.
loyd of the North Carolina Con
ference, and passed through the
varied experiences of a Method
ist minister's wife. In about
1858 he traveled the Iredell cir
cuit and they lived in the parson-
age at Olin. It was during this
year that 1 became intimately ac
quainted and associated with
them, and to this day I feel much
indebted to them lor godly in-
stmctions and influence in di
recting my young life. Laterthey
lived at Lenoir and at Boone, in
Watauga County, where he died
July 3rd, 1885. After, his de
parture she moved to Columbia,
Tenn., where she lived for many
years. "Her last earthly home
was in Nashville, Tenn., with the
loving care and companionship
of her son and daughter about
her, and her grave was made in
beautiful Rose Hill cemetery at
Columbia, where people loved
her through the long years that
her moving tent was pitched a
mong them." She was born No
vember 24th, 1830, and depart
ed this life Feb. 17th, 1916, at
the age of a little over- 85 years,
She lived through a long and
momentous period both in the
Church and State. "She saw the
old order of Southern lile pass
awav and the new types of
thought and new phases of civili
zation take its place." She had
lived a long and useful life, and
when the final call came she bad
only to "draw the drapery of her
couch and lie down" to sleep un
til Christ shall come to awake
her on the morning of the Res-
surrection.
Mrs. Adaline Feimster, who re
wmtlv lived and passed away in
Statesville at the home of her
son, M. A. Feimster, ex-treasurer
of Ire Jell county, was the oldes'
Tbi Geraii State if Miol
Charleston News and Courier.
A staff correspondent of t h e
New York Times writing from
Berlin sums up "tbe feeling of the
average German in the street ap
proximately as follows: "He has
a strong desire for peace with
honor and the quicker the bet
ter; a conviction that France and
Russia are- practically beaten
and that -but for England peace
could be made tomorrow; and a
further conviction that England
alone holds the allied coalition
against Germany together. He
also believes that England is Ger
many's real and only enemy; that
there can be no peace until Eng
land is beaten; that England can
be beaten by ruthless submarine
warfare, and that tbe von Tir
pits plans of torpedoing all ships
found in English waters is prob
ably the only way of beating
her."
If that is an accurate summary
of the feeling of the German mass
es, some interesting conclusions
are possible. The beliefs outlined
are based, it will be observed, up
on the promise that France and
Russia are "practically beaten."
Suppose it becomes clearly evi
dent m the near future to the
German masses, as well as to the
world in general, that France and
Russia are very far from being
beaten. It is not possible that
from this revelation there wonld
ensue in Germany a revulsion of
feeling certain to be attended by
highly important results?
The revelation may come soon.
ranee still holds Verdun and
will probably continue to hold it.
f she does, the belief that France
is practically beaten can hardly
persist. The Russian advances in
Asia Minor and their effect upon
.'urkey, together with the re
sumption of Russian attacks on
Germany's eastern front, ought
to disabuse the German masses
before very long in regard to the
status of Russia.
The result of this enlightenment
cannot be foreseen. They Might
not tend towards an early peace:
or while Germany has probably
already ' reached a point where
she would be willing to accept a
compromise falling far short of
her initial aims and ambitions,
she is probably still far from the
point where she would accept
terms practically decreeing her
death as a great power. Never
theless, if events show the Ger
man people that France and Rus
sia are not beaten aud probably
cannot be beaten, the efiVct in
Germany cannot but be of tre
mendous importance. Victory o
ver England on tbe sea would
then be the last chance.
Severe Cold Quickly Cured.
"On Dec. flrt 1 had a seyere
cold or attack of the grip as ft
may be. and was nearly down in
bed," writes 0 J Metcalf, Weath-
erly. Mo. "I bought two bot
tles ol Chamberlain's Cough Rem
edy and it was only a few days
until 1 was completely restored
to health. I firmly believe that
Cbamberlbin'e Cough Remedy is
one of tbe very best medicines
and will know what to do when
I have another cold." Obtaina

the care of individual and family
health is first and most patriotic
duty of a citizen." Taft.

Thi Installment Auto.
"Wonder how he can afford it?"
Ever hear that question asked
as some man whose bankaccount
is of doubtful proportions was
seen speeding by in an automo
bile? Hundreds of times, no
doubt. It is probably a fact that
in all communities there are men
who have fallen into the tempta
tion to buy an automobile who
are not financially able to make
the purchase or to meet the up
keep of the machine. Heretofore
the automobile whether as luxury
oi necessity, has been one article
for whose ownership there was
demanded cash payment. W hen
a man would speak of his "car,"
it might be put down as a cer
tainty that he had parted with
the price of the machine had
raised the money by hook or
crook. There might have been a
mortgage on his house, bnt there
was none on the machine. And
now we are to have the automo
bile on the installment plan. At
least, the experiment has been
launched by some makers in the
North. The Observer prelersto
speak of it as an experiment be
cause it believes it will not go be
yond that point. The plan to
buy an automobile on the in
stallment plan would offer too
great an inducement for indul
gence in extravagence. It would
open the way to trouble for a
class little able to resist the temp
tation. It looks like an easy
proposition to pay down a sum
of money and become owner of a
machine against the simple con
tingency of having to surrender
it in case of failure to make a
payment, but many people, al
ready loaded up with installment
obligations for buildingand loan
assessments, perhaps, or for
household furnishings and other
necessities, would "fall" to it to
their sorrow. The installment
plan for the purchase of automo
bile would be anything but an en
couragement to thrift. Char-

Every sage this scheme indoro
es: Make your premises look neat;
cart away the old dead horses,
burn the rubbish and repeat. For
the spring should find our city
rid of every ugly thing; it will be
a beastly pity, if we disappoint
the spring. In the spring the
world is laundered by the soft,
refreshing showers, and the clean
sing winds are squandered by
Dame Nature at all hours; but
the rainfall and the breezes can't
remove the trash and junk which,
like decomposing cheeses fill the
air with perfume punk. Let us
hustle and abolish everything
that draws the flies; let us clean
and paint and polish till our
town delights the eyes. Oh,
ought to sing the lily, when old
winter ups and goes, and 1 ought
to write some silly bladderdash
about the rose, but I make my
harpstrings rattle urging folks
to clean their lawns, cart away

Letter from Mr. 1. C. WbLtinitoi.
Mr. J. C. Whittington, of Myr-
le Point, Oregon, a Wataugan
of "ye olden time," in remitting
tor his paper writes:
I have just returned from a
rip to Southern uaiiiornia. i
left home on the 4th day of last
November and went by steamer
to San Francisco. We had a very
ougb trip down, but I did not
get sea sick as a great many do.
spent three days on the grounds
of the Panama Exposition ta
king the sights, which were
grand. There was all kinds of
mineral and agricultural prod
ucts, with all kinds of machinery
and works of art, and almost ev
erything a person could think of.
After taking in the Fair I pro
ceeded on to Southern California,
where I spent the winter in the
town of Pomond, where two of
my sisters have lived for quite a
number of j ars. I liked the coun
try pretty well but a man would
have to have a lot of money to
locate there, as land is very high
in that part of the country, be
ing worth from one thousand to
fifteen hundred dollars per acre.
The most of the land is in orch
ards, such as oranges, lemons,
peaches and prunes, consequent-
all lands are very high. We
had very bad weather lor that
councry this winter, it rained
more through January than it
generally does through the entire
season. They had 23 inches of
rain and 18 inches of it January,
and one snow storm, when en
ough fell to make the g r o u n d
white, but it melted off soon af
ter it fell. In order to protect
their fruit from the frost, they
burn oil in pots under the trees
on cold mornings, the neac oi
which will raise the temperature
several degrees which prevents
the fruit from freezing.
9 Develop Blowing Rock Hotel Oa A Big
Scale la Near Future.
In the near future the Browing
lock Hotel at Blowing Rock will
be organized into a joint stock
company and active efort will be
put behind a proposition to de
velop it into one of the greatest
resort hotels in the mountains of
Western North Carolina. A num
ber of interested parties held a
meeting at Hickory last week,
however, they have not issued
any statement yet.
Mr. George E. Moore, who for
the past several years has had
charge of tbe hotel, was at home
this Meek from Arkansas, where
he has been during the winter
months. Mr. Moore is closely
connected with the financial side
of this hotel aud he says that the
idea in organizing a big stock
company is to get more money
behind the proposition and a
velop it to its full capacity. It
is probable that a new and mod
ern hotel building would be built.
A golf course would be built and
everything else thatgoes to make
up modern resort property would
be added.
The Blowing Rock Hotel is an
evcellent building as it is and will
accommodate a great number of
guests, but the idea is to build a
jnuch larger building and equip
it with all modern conveniences
The new building will be built on
the same site where the old buil
ding now stands. Lenoir News.
