Cleveland, March 29.—Willi a toll
ol' at least 30 persons dead and 40 or
more injured, federal and stale offi­
cials and officials of the railroad com­
panies began today an invest igfialion
into Hie cause that led early this
morning to one of the most disastrous
wrecks that lias occurred in this slate
in a dozen years, and one ol' the worst
in the history of the New Vork Cen­
tral railroad.
Three trains, including the 2lltli
Century, the New York Central's Pal­
atial Flier, and two sections of No. 87,
known as the Chicago-Pittsburg Limit­
ed, eastbound, came together in a col­
lision near Amherst., 0., U7 miles west
of Cleveland.
Three Trains Collide.
Ileports generally credited were
that the first and second sections of
No. 8(i were proceeding at a rapid
pace and at- some points were only a
mile apart. When the first section
crashed into the second section, the
20th Century Limited train crashed
into the two trains, and the three
were larown into an indescribable
uuiss. •-.••v-te
The great coaches and engines .of
No. 86 were toppled over and wreck­
age was piled high in the air. Four­
teen' coaches overturned.
20th Century Unscathed.
The 20th Century, notwithstanding
its impact with the debris from the
other trains, emerged almost unscath­
ed and proceeded on its western jour­
ney, its passengers uninjured except
for a shaking up. A pall of fog from
Lake Erie had settled down over nor­
thern Ohio and the night was of al­
most inky darkness.
W. F. Schaff, district superintend­
ent of the New York Central lines,
said today:
Towerman Blameless.
"The towerman can have nothing to
do with the cause of this wreck. The
explanation lies between the engin­
eers and tne block signal system.
"We tested out the block signal sys­
tem this morning after the wreck, and
found it working perfectly. After the
wreck, Engineer Hess, with his fire­
man, A. A. Haight, and the brakeman
or the 20th Century Limited, walked
back to the signal which Hess drove
by.. They all said they found the sig­
nal was red, or blocked then.
Terrible Confusion.
Reports of terrible confusion fol­
lowed the wreck.
Many of the injured pinioned in the
wreckage called pitiously for help as
uninjured passengers, half-clad, quick­
ly emerged and joined with trainmen
and others in the rescue work. A bon­
fire from some of the wreckage
brought the nrst rays of light on the
scene of desolation and death. Fire­
men from Amherst were among the
first arrivals and soon succeeded in
quenching the flames.
Passengers on the 20th Century
Limited, who escaped injury, despite
the fact' that the train of eight coach­
es plowed through the wreckage of
two sections of an eastbound train at
high speed told of the catastrophe on
arrival in Chicago today.
No Panic.
There was no panic on the Limited,
the passengers said. The electric
light, continued to glow, and the oc­
cupants of the sleeping cars were en­
abled, after they were jostled awake
in their berths, to arrange temporary
relief for the persons injured in the
collision.
Henry l\ llunkle, director of the
German-Austrian-Hungarian Relief so­
ciety, attributed the escape of those
aboard the 20th Century Limited to
the terrifiee speed of the train carry­
ing it through the debris before the
cars had time to tip over.

Probe New Plots to Violate
Neutrality of United States
Washington, March 29.—An expedi
tipn to invade Canada which was halt­
ed by the failure of a Buffalo, New
York, lawyer to appear at a lime
agreed upon with an organized "firing
squad," it' was asserted tonight, was
part of an alleged conspiracy to vio­
late the neutrality laws of the United
States upon which the agents of the
department of justice are secretly
working, in connection with the re­
turn here yesterday from England of
1-lerst von der Goln.
Von cer Golz, who.it is said, claims
to have been a trusted agent of Cap­
tain Von Papen, former German mili­
tary attache in this country, wan
questioned at length today by United
States District Attorney Marshal and
his assistant, Roger 15. Wood.

Dr. Waite Also Placed Disease
Germs in Mrs. Peck's
Food
New York, March 29.—District At­
torney Edward Swann centered his at­
tention tonight upon locating Eugene
Oliver Kane, who embalmed the body
of John E. Peck, wealthy Grand Rap­
ids druggist, for whose murder his
son-in-law, Dr. Arthur Warren Waite,
is under arrest here. Kane's arrest
has been ordered on the charge of
conspiring to commit a crime. Waite
is said by Mr. Swann to have declar­
ed that Kane accepted $9,000 in cash
and a check for $9,400 as part pay­
ment of $25,000 he was to be paid for
swearing that he used arsenic in em­
balming Peck's body. This arrange­
ment, Waite saiu, according to the
district attorney, was made after an
autopsy on Peck's body disclosed a
large. quantity of arsenic. Waite, in
a statement to the district attorney
and others, is said to have admitted
not only the poisoning of Peck, but
the placing of virulent disease germs
in the food of Mrs. Peck.
ARMY USE
BILL III SENATE
Republicans and Democrats Join
Hands to Speed up
Legislation
'Washington, March 29.—Considera­
tion of the army increase bill, the
first of the big national defense meas­
ures, began in the senate today with
the republicans joining the democrats
in the hope that it be disposed of
quickly.
Senator Chamberlain, chairman of
the militia committee, introduced the
measure, which is a substitute for
the Hay bill passed by the house.
When the bill had been read, it was
laid aside to permit senators to fa­
miliarize themselves with it. To­
morrow it will be called up for read­
ing by sections, to be kept constant­
ly before the senate until passed.
Senator Chamberlain announced he
would ask for night sessions unless
reasonable progress is made without
them.
Wood told an impressive tale of plots
and counter plots.
The federal authorities let it be
known that the publicity given to Von
der Golz's return here, accompanied
by a detective sargent from Scotland
Yard, may interfere with their plans
to round up suspects wanted in con­
nection with the alleged military ex­
pedition to Canada, which it was said
Von der Golz has admitted involved
the blowing up of bridges and build­
ings, and the destruction of the Wel
land canal.
Franz von Ryntellen, a German,
held in England as a prisoner of war,
has sent word to officials here that ho
can give testimony of value in prose­
cuting neutrality cases and is willing
to do st» il" permitted to come to the
United States in custody as was llersf
von der Golz, who arrived in New
York yesterday. Itynlellen's offer will
be considered, hut il is understood
TJrilish authorities probably will not
be willing to let him cross to this
country.

Big Navy Program Needed to
Equal Germany's
Strength
Washington, March 2!».—Appropria­
tion by congress for eight new battle­
ships this year, double the number
proposed in the administration nve
year navy program, was recommended
by Assistant Secretary Roosevelt to­
day in concluding hi« tesUpipny be­
fore the house committee.
Secretary Daniels will appear to­
morrow as the last witness to be
heard. His examination is expected
to require several days.
Mr. Roosevelt explained that the re­
commendation for eight ships immed­
iately represented his personal views
and those of the department.
"I believe the government and pri­
vate yards could take care of eight
batleships this year," he said. "If
Germany should continue to build at
her present rate or three ships a year,
our program of three and on-fifth
ships in five years would not quite
catch up but would mean a gain. We
probably, would pass France, with
which we are now neck and neck."
Questioned about Japans navy, Mr.
Roosevelt said Loth Japan and Ger­
many were reported to have secret
building funds and programs.

ceipt. of the news that Carranza, the
de facto president of Mexico, had
given permission for the passage of
food supplies for the United States'
punitive expedition.
Mexican Consul iLeLevier announc­
ed today that the column of 1,100
cavalry, under General Gomez, which

ASSURES EARLY
ARRIVAL OF SUPPLIES
Washington, March 21).—One of the
army's most serious problems in
hunting Villa, was solved today when
General Carranza promptly granted
the request of the State department
for permission to use the Northwes­
tern railroad in carrying out the pur­
suit.
General Carranza received the re
quest this morning. His answer was
in Washington before dark. It was
contained in a brief message from
John L. .Rogers, Special Agent of the
United States at Guerataro, saying
the head of the DeFacto government
agreed to the commercial use of the
line. Officials here assume he would
be equally prompt in notifying offi­
cers on the border, and that General
Funston might begin shipment tomor­
row.
Reply Satisfactory.
Today's response is regarded as be­
ing satisfactory in a measure, but it
is not sufficiently definite. It may
be, too, that in order to assure the
arrival and delivery of supplies ship­
ped to points along the line, General
Funston will desire to place guards
on the trains.
War department, officials were
,greatly relieved by the removal of
the necessity of maintaining motor
truck supply trains.
Condition Not Good.
While (he physical condition of the
Mexican Northwestern is not good,
army engineers should "have little dif­
ficulty in keeping it open.
In Mexico, the agreement is under­
stood to have another object.
General Carranza is said to desire
its perfection as a definite and bind­
ing understanding with the United
States which he can show to his peo­
ple in support of his statement that
no sovereign rights of his country
have been surrendered or violated.
First Train.
The first train bearing supplies to
the United States troops at the front
probably will leave Juarez sometime
tomorrow. Immediately on receipt of
the news from (Washington that Gen­
eral Carranza had permitted the use
of the Northwestern railroad for sup­
plies, final preparations were rushed

ment of forage, food supplies and gas­

CRAVE CRISIS
State Department Using1 All
Agencies to Gather
Facts
BURDEft OF PROOF
ON ADMINISTRATION
Passengers on Various Grafts
Sunk Say Boats Were
Torpedoed
Washington, March 29.—The ac«
cumulation of circumstantial evidence
that Germany has engaged upon a,
campaign of submarine warfare which
has no regard for the rights of Amer­
ican citizens traveling on merchant
ships of belligerent nationality, tfeft
administration considers, has created
one of the most serious situations
which has confronted the United
States since the beginning of the war.
Every agency opened to the state
department today was being, employed
in an effort to gather an unimpeach­
able array of facts regarding tne
ex­
plosion which damaged the steamer,
Sussex, the sinking of the British
steamer, Manchester Engineer, Eagle
Point, the Dutch steamship, Tubancia.
and the alleged firing of a torpedo at
the French steamship, Patria. All of
these ships carried American citizens
and all apparently were attacked in
violation of Germany's recently re­
newed assurrances to the United
States.
Next Step Decided.
The next step is said authoritatively
to have been determined upon. Unless
Germany's reply to inquiries made
by the United States makes some
statement to cause the state depart­
ment to change its present intentions,
it is understood that all the recent
aggravating incidents will be com­
bined in one general, formidable in­
dictment which will bring the subject
to a clear cut issue. Should Germany
admit responsibility for any of the at­
tacks, an attempt to satisfy the Unit­
ed States by saying that a mistake
had been made, otter to make repar­
ation, and to punish the submarine
commander, the issue would not by
any means be disposed of.
Demands Punishment.
It is regarded as certain that tho
United States would not accept such
an explanation as satisfactory, unless
it was shown that punishment was
actually meted out to the offending
submarine commander, and whether
any value longer could be attached to
Germany's promise. In the event of
Germany disclaiming any responsibil­
ity for the disasters, the United States
will proceed with its investigation to
determine whether the evidence
which now strongly indicates that the
Sussex and other ships were tor­
pedoed without warning can be re­
garded as conclusive proof. The very
number of attacks which have re­
cently occurred is regarded as parti­
cularly significant'.
Secret 'Instructions.
It became known during the day
that the state department bad heard
unofficially the suggestion that Ger­
man submarine commanders were act­
ing under secret instructions, such as
were advocated by Admiral Von Tir
pirtz, to torpedo every vessel ap­
proaching the British Isles.
The United btates was advised the
new orders to submarines which went
into effect March 16 provided for the
attacks without warning of all mer*
chantmen of the Eentente allies.
The British have no official confirm­
ation whatever of the secret order Te»
ported. .j
What is described in high
admin­
istration circles as the extreme grav­
ity of the situation makes it necessary
for the United States to proceed with,
the utmost care in preparing tor the
next step. While all of the
recent
cases will play an important
p4rt in
the final consideration, the
the Sussex will probably form
cardinal feature.
