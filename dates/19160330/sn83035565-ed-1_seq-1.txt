Mud can not be measured by
the ton, to say nothing abou
smaller measures. The quantity
is immense and travel from place
to place by vehicle is very diffi
cult.
Lemuel Miller moved with his
family iito the country, going on
a small home and will try farming
for a change.
L. E. Harvey sold the G. W.
Reck stock of vehicles and farm
implements in this place at pub
lie sale last Saturday, which a
mounted to about $1100.
Rev. J. 0. Hillery failed to 11
his appointment at our M. E
church last night from some
cause. Con j ecture might say his
auto ditched or some other mis
fortune overtook him. Travel
for the night, considering the
condition of the roads and ex
treme darkness, was somewhat
perilous, which may account for
his failure.
Rev. McKinney of Greenville
preached yesterday morning in
our Presbyterian church, while
Rev. Carr of this place held forth
to Rev. McKinney's people dur
ing the same hour. These pas
tors exchanged pulpits for the
time being.
Mrs. M. A. Myers is seriously
ill at this writing, having been
confined to the house since last
November.
Our township trustees met in
regular session last Saturday to
transact routine business and in
stall the newly appointed trustee.
The board is happily filled now
and from this time forward we
may expect something worth
' while done.
On account of the unfavorable
weather yesterday our M. E. ;
Sunday school failed to measure
up to its usual attendance, yet it
did well and presented no room
for discouragement for securing
the goal set for Easter.
- Miss Mildred Moul, attending
school at Columbus, spent yes
terday at home with her parents.
So also 'did Harry Reck, student
aff 6. S. U., visit his parents yes
terday. G. W. Reck is suffering the
pain of a flattened great toe on
one of his feet. ( It will be some
time until he will walk with com
fort. Ben Hahn has parted company
with his great city and has be
gun his usual work 'again. ,
Silas Horner of Richmond, Ind. ,
spent a day here last week with
relatives and friends.
Daniel Moul of Pleasant Hill
gave this place a business call
last Saturday.
It seems our city is to have its
limits enlarged by annexation of
territory, and why not? When
that is done our people will be
under no need to build in hollows
and fill up to secure tha proper
height for beauty and proper ele
vation for health.

Cracking whips in peoples'
faces is not a very wise or bright
thing to do. Sometimes people
might be punished for such mis
demeanors. A word to the wise
is sufficient.
Quite a large number of peofle
attended the spelling match in
the Junior Hall last Friday night.
No one could claim the victory,
as both of the last spellers on the
floor missed the word, and Hom
er Jefferis, a former teacher of
this township, spelled it correct
ly. Misses Esther and Alice Sini-
ard visited Miss Sadie Elliott of
Nashville over Sunday.

Dangers ol Draft.
Drafts f tel tetter when we are
hot and perspiring, just when
they a.re most dangerous and the
result is Neuralgia. Stiff Neck,
Sore Muscles or sometimes an at
tack of Rheumatism. In such
cases apply Sloan's Liniment. It
stimulates circulation to the sore
and painful part. The blood flows
freely aid in a short time the
stiffness and pain loaves. Those
suffering from Neuralgic Head
ache will find one or Wo applica
tions of Sloan's Liniment will
give grateful relief. The ago
nizing pain gives way to a ting
ling sensation , of comfort and

is possible. Good for Neuritis
too. Price 25c at your druggist.

new style of toothbrush, in the
manufacture of which wood pulp
plays a prominent part:
"The newly patented scheme
dispenses entirely with 1 he use of
animal bristles and makes use of
points made of paper pulp im

The Planets for A.pril.
Venus will continue to increase
in brightness during the er.tire
month and can be seen in . the
west as the evening star. The
planent Saturn will also be in
good position for observation
high np and slightly to the west,
while Mars can be seen to the
east as a bright, ruddy star. This
last planet has attracted more
popular interest than any other
on account of the socalled canals,
These are narrow greenish streaks,
which cover a large portion of
the planet and were given by
Schiaparelli, who first made a
careful study of them, the Italian
name for streak, a word which
sounds amazingly like the Eng
lish word canal and as a result
the English-speaking people as
sumed that they were artificial,
while as a matter of fact they are
probably of natural origin,
If we were on that plantt an
were t look at this earth with
such a telescope as we have used
to study Mars and happened to
examine the central portion of
the United States the great val
leys of the Ohio, Missouri, Ark
ansas and Mississippi would ap
pear almost as straight and nar
row as the markings on Mars,
but would be hidden by the veg
etation of the surrounding fertile
country. Should, however, thit
land lose its fertility and become
arid so that thee great rivers
with their fringe of vegetation
were the only green spots in ar
otherwise barren desert, the sim .
ilarity in appearance to the can
als of Mars would be very pro-
nourced.
In this connection it must be
remembered that while on the
earth the area of its surface cov
ered with water is much greater
than the portion covered with
land, on Mars the condition is
exactly reversed, the land cov
ered area being greater than that
water covered, provided of course
that what we call Martian land
and water are correctly named,
ar.d as to this there will be more
to say in May. Emtrson McMil

Spiced Beef Tongue.
One beef tongue, one cupful of sugar,
one tablespoon ful of cloves aud one
pinch of saltpeter. Rub sugar; cloves
and saltpeter into tongue, immerse in
brine made of one-quarter pound of
salt, two quarts of water and Ueep
well covered. Let stand four or five
days; then make a thin paste of flour
and water, wrap tongue in It and bake
slowly in pan. basting well with lard
and water. When done remove the
paste. '
Removing Mud Stains.
For removing mud stains from white
or cream serge the following method
is excellent: First allow the mud to
dry thoroughly; then cover the spots
with common table salt and leave for
two or three minutes. When this is
finished take a piece of tissue paper
and lightly rub off the salt. Finally
apply a little French chalk, brush off
with a clean brush, nnd you will And
all the marks have vanished.
Tolak a Steak Tender,
If you have misgivings as to the
tenderness of steak place it on a board
and with a -wooden mallet or potato
masher pound it vigorously on' both
sides. Then place it on a plate and
rub a little vinegar into it. Vinegar
will soften the fiber of the hardest
meat and at the same time improve
the flavor. .
To Keep Ham Soft,
Ham mav be kept from getting hard
and drv on the outside thus: Take
. Let it get hard; then spread on the cut
end of the ham half an inch thick.
This excludes air. Hang in a cool

place. Oiefore slicing tue nam scrape
off this fat and spread It on afterward
as before.

CAPTAIN PIKKSTOK'S FIGURES
Of 41,168 Men Examined Only 3,833
Were Accepted as Physically Fit
For Government Service Medical
Men Give as One Reason That Vi
tality Has Been Sapped by Alcohol
and Excesses Caused by Drink.
New York. ( Spec ial.) DiscuEsion
cf probable war has aroused interest
in a table preuared by Captain L. P.
Pinkston ot the 1'nited States marine
corps stafT, stationed in this city. Tha
table shows that, ot all applicants for
enlistment the country over last year,
only t.31 per cent were accounted
physically fit for government service.
This is an average of oue man in each
e'even examined.
In all districts of the country 41.16S
men were examined, and of. this num
ber bul 3,833 were accepted.
Of the 11,012 applicants examined
in this city, only 316 were accepted
for enlistment! In Baltimore. 1,786
were examined and 183 accepted.
Cleveland, 2.S12 examined and 17a ac
cepted. Cincinnati, l,1C" examined
tind 199 accepted. In Chicago, 4,443
were examined and 434 accepted. Ia
San Francisco, 2,732 were examined
and 224 accepted.
This is the startling condition w hich
confronts the United States. When
it comes to real preparedness, men
are of far more moment than money.
There Is plenty of money in the coun
try, but Captain PinUston's figures are
just cause for alarm when men are
considered.
Medical men in and out of military
circles are not slow in detailing the
causes of the physical unfitness of so
many young Americans. One of these
reasons is that alcoholic liquors and
the excesses- which many of those
who drink are prone to indulge in
saps t:ie vitality of the young man
hood of the countrv.
Captain Pinkston's, statistics. ae
causing mush concern. England faced
the same, trouble when she engaged
in the present war. Drink had under
mined the strength and virility of
many of her young men. If only one
out of eleven applicants for service in
this country are found fit, our real
fighting strength is greatly weakened.
A large proportion of saloon ratrons
in the United States are under 30
years of age. It is the young nin
who are being ground through the
paloon mill. Drink renders ti.en unfit
for' military duty as well as for the
sereral duties of citizenship. .

Sweeping Victory of Drys In Province
oF Manitoba.
The province of Manitoba, Canada,
which voted dry recently, has an area
tv.v-e as great as that of Ohio. Many
former Ohioans are now citizens of
the province. Winnipeg, the capHal.
has a population of 1.10.000. That city
"(Oted dry by a big majority. Two
hundred saloons and many wholesale
houses will close June 1.
Canada is rapidly becoming dry.
Prince Edward Island is entirely dr.
Nova Scotia is all under prohibition
except the city of Halifax. New Bruns
wick has prohibition in ten of her fif
teen counties. Quebec has 906 dry
towns and only 237 wet. The province
cf Saskatchewan is all dry. The prov
ince of Alberta voted for prohibition
kst July. Ontario and British Co
lumbia are getting ready to vote.
CLEVELAND OFFICIALS
AND JOHN BARLEYCORN
Drinking on Duty By Employes
Will Not Be Tolerated. .
Cleveland, O. (Special.) Anti
c) rinking orders are expected to be
posted in all municipal departments
of this city soon. Department direc
tors have declared unanimously that
all employes found drinking liquor
while on duty will be instantly dis
charged. Utilities Director Farrell says:
"Drinking liquor while on duty will
not be tolerated. No drinking goes
tn city time.
Finance Director Neal says: "'In
stant dismissal is the punishment for
aP workers jn my department who
take a nip during working hours."
The action of the officials is ctuising
a flutter among the thousand em
ployes, but the orders are accepted in
good spirit.
Saloonkeeper Want Protection.
The Ohio Liquor league appeals to
.the state liquor licensing board to
jrs and speekeasy keepers. This is
a frank admission of the failure ot
license. The brewers have a strong
CTlp on the
CTtp on the liquor business of tbe
state and fail as readily to unlicensed
as to licensed dealers.
