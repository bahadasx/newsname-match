The docket for the spring term of
chancery court, which 'will convena
at 9 o'clock next Monday morning
and which will be presided over hy
Hon. Albert Y. Woodward, judge of
the Sixth chancery court district, is
an abnormally large and unusually
important one; for, while there are
numerous cases of a trivial nature
to be adjudicated some of them are
of a character which lift them above
the ordinary court routine and
make them of general public in
terest. Without a doubt the most impor
tant case on the docket is that which
is to settle the ownership oif the es
tate of the late Mrs. M. B. Port
woord, the valuation of which " is
variously estimated at from $40,000
to $50,000. Mrs. Portwood died last
April, and soon thereafter two in
struments, each purporting to. be
her last will and testament were
filed with Chancery Clerk B. A. Lin
coln for probate. One of these in
strument was executed in 1869, and
ia it the testatrix names as "heirs
the children of her sister, the ' late
Mrs. Regin Harrison. The heirs now
living who become beneficiaries
should thia wilt finally he declared
valid and ordered probate, bains
James T. Harrison and Mr. . Allen
Harrison of tai city, and .'iflon.
Blewett Lee of Chicago. The other
names the children of the lata
Thomas Blewett and Allen Blewett,
brothers of the testatrrx," as benefic
iaries, and should this document be
accepted by the court as Mrs. Port
wood's last will and testament the
property will go to the children of
her two brothers. In the litigation
now pending Mrs. Alena Bester, a
sister of Mrs. Portwood, also 'seeks
to share in the distribution of her
property.
The Harrison heirs are represent
ed by Hon. James T. Harrison and
Messrs. Sturdivant, Owen and Gar
nett, and it is probable that ' Hon.
Blewett Lee will come here from
Chicago to participate with these
gentlemen in the presentation - of
their side of the case, while the in
terests of the Blewett heirs are in
the hands of Hon. James N. Gren
ade, of Chatham, Ala., who is relat
ed to these heirs by ties of affinity.
The docket, which as usual is
crowded with divorce cases, in most
of which the litigants are negroes,

London, March 29. After many

preparation for another attempt to
lessen the six miles intervening be
tween them and the Paris-Verdun
railway and the nine miles still be
tween them and Verdun, the Ger
mans launched a great infantry at

There is still an intermittent bom

Jackson, Miss., March i'J. After
patient and unremitting labor for 8
or 10 years by the Mississippi Asso
ciation of Funeral Directors and
Emhulmer, the members of that or
ganization have finally been able to
get a bill through both branches of
the Legislature to provide for a
state board for the better regulation
of the practice of that profession in
the state. The Senate hnd this bill
before it on the forenoon Thursday
and after considerable skirmishing
the bill passed by a good majority.
The bill provides for a board of
six members, three to be nominated
to the governor by the funeral di
rector's association and three by the
state board of health. The powers
and duties of the examining board
are duly hnd specifically stated in
the rather long and technically
drawn measure.
The Senate also passed another
House bill, which was to provide for
a state board of optometry, whih
scored after a long and interesting
discussion. Representatives of the
medical profession, both the state
association and the state boar) of
health, were heard in opposition to
the t ill, wl lie practicing opt ome
trists spoke in advocacy of it. The
vote was close but friends of the bilT
believe that they can dispose of
the motion to reconsider when the
proper time Is reached.
Th( Senate committee on finance
reported back favorably the ; omni
bus bond issue bills to provide for
all sorts of - public' improvements a
favored by the governor, .amounting
to $1,300,000. Just what will, be:
come of them is a matter of doubt,
but the concensus of belief is that
some of them will be scuttled in
short order.
The feature of the House pro
ceedings was the election . of two
members from the body-at-large to
serve on the recess committee, pro
vided by the Stohe resolution, to
study out a better, financial plan for
the state, with the end in view of
devising better means, if possible,
to raise more revenue and make the
burden of taxation more equitable.
Under the resolution eight members
of the eleven on the committee will
be chosen, one from each congres
sional district, nominated by the rep
resentatives from each district, in
the House and appointed by the
speaker. The speaker, M. S. Connor,
is made a member ex-officio of the
committee.

j Remain Firm in Decision to
Enter Columbua in Clean
City Contest.
I Aroused to action ry the severe
(indictment of Dr. Willis Walley,
(Chief sanitary inspector of the Mis
issippi Hoard of Health, who in an
address recently delivered here de
clared Columbus to be one of the fil
thiest cities in the state, members of
the Ladies" Civic League, under
whose direction a campaign forclean
liness is to be prosecuted during the
week of April 10, have decided to re
double their effort and will endeav

I and span condition that Dr. Walley
can find no cause for complaint
when he makes his next visit, which
will be soon after the campaign has
been concluded.
Mrs. William Baldwin, president
of the Ladies' Civic League, stated
most emphaticaly that the indict
ment of the health expert would not
deter members of the organization
from entering Columbus in the clean
city contest which is to be conducted
under the auspices of the Mississippi
Board, of .Health. They do not re
sent the remarks of the inspector, a
they feel that they were made in a
spirit of kindness and intended more
as a warning than as a criticism.
It seems to be generally concluded
here that the present mode of sani
tary inspection is both antiquated
and Inadequate. Under the provis
ions of the city charter the enforce

nances ih .under. the di'wtlon ofa,"

the remaining members draw no aal

Dr.' Walley urged the appointment
of a single inspector, who would be .
paid a fair salary and be required to
devote his entire time to the work.
