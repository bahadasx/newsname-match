BIRTH OF A NATION
i . f1 ' ' h
At the Salt Lake Theater, During
Semi-Annual Conference
Week
For many years American dramat
ists wrote able plays of particular
states, cities or localities, ranging
from Alabama to tho Henrietta, and
from Way Down East, to tho Great
Divide. But no one man seemed to
grasp tho whole spirit and genius of
America until David Ward Griffith
picked a suggestion for his theme out
of Dixon's Tho Leopard's Spots, and
Tho Clansman and started to dovol
op It.
A remarkable thing about Mr. Grif
fith's plan Is that words (oxcept for
leaders and titles) do not enter Into
It. Perhaps words have cramped ra
ther, than aided previous ficttonlsts
and dramatists. At any rato, ho re
placed speech with music, and tho
old fashioned atago action and scen
ery, by me picionauzea action oi
thousands of players In tho great out
of doors. In brier, ho staged tho
great battles, struggles and critical
ovents of 1861-70 under conditions as
nearly as possible similar to tho or
iginal. Tho result of Mr. Griffith's effort
Is n new and stupendous art for
which no ndequato name has yot boon
found. Tho Birth of a Nation com
bines spcctaclo, romanco, domestic
drama, comedy, tragedy, music and
mechanical offects Into harmonious
cnscmblo that captivates equally tho
oyo and tho ear. In n representation
lasting two hours and forty-fivo min
utes, It epitomizes tho llfo of a na
tion. This Is something tho old art
could novcr do. Tho obsolete so call
ed stago and unities aro thrown to
tho winds, and Griffith carries tho
magnificent story from the introduc
tion of African slavery right down
through Civil War and Reconstruc
tion days to tho final real union ot
South nnd North lu tho bonds of lovo
and peace.
Among tho distinguished actors In
tho cast aro Henry B. Walthall, Lil
lian Gish, Muo Marsh, Miriam Coop
er, Mary Alden, Joscphlno Crowoll,
Ralph Lewis, Joseph Henabery, Raoul
Walsh, Donald Crisp, Howard 'Gayo,
Georgo Slegman, Walter Long, Elmer
CHfton nnd Robert Herron.
Eighteen thousand pcoplo, 3000
horses and no less than 5000 scenes
went Into tho making of tho big spec
taclo.
Conference visitors come prepared
to wltnoss tho world's greatest spcc
taclo of a llfo tlmo.
