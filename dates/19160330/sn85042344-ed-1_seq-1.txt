Issues up to them.
The precinct workers are fired with

in the city that is not being organized

ATLANTA. Cla., March 2H. Gov
ernor Harris of Georgia today re
ceived assurances from Governor
Ferguson of Texas that the Ueorgiu
reuuisition for Ictor t.. Innes and
his wife, approved by former Gov
ernor Colquitt would be allowed to
stand. Georgia officers left Atlanta
for San Antonio late today to bring
the J tmeses here for trial on charges
of larceny after trust.
Innes and his wife, who were
acquitted at San Antonio of a charge
of murder In connection with the
death of Mrs. Elols Nelms Dennla
and her sister, Miss Beatrice Nelms
of Atlanta, recently told Governor
Ferguson they feared mob violence
of they were returned to Georgia
In a telegram to the Texas executive
Governor Harris styled the mob vlo
lence charges ns "absurd." Tho
Inncses previously had appealed to
the I'nlted States supreme court
without avail in an effort to escape
extradition to Georgia.
The indictments for larceny

PERMISSION GIVEN
TO USE RAILROAD
Carranza Grants Permis
sion to Use North
western Railroad.
AMERICAN CREWS
WON'T BE ALLOWED
And Supplies Must Go as
'Commercial Freight,"
Says Chief.
SAN ANTONIO, Texas, March 29.
Carranza's permission to ship
supplies over tho Northwestern rail
road to the troops In Mexico who are
scouring the country to locate Fran
cisco Villa, was received at General
Funston's headquarters with every
sign of rejoicing, but this manifesta
tion of pleasure was tempered by the
news that the supplies must be con
signed as ordinary freight to some
Individual not connected with the
army, ljite today General Kunston
had not received official notification
that he was at liberty to ship sup
plies through Juarez to Casus Gran
ges, but orders already Issued to the
commissury department were such
that no delay was anticipated. It was
said that within a few hours or even
minutes the stores that the. quarter
muster department had been accumu
lating at Kl I'aso could be billed to
points along the Northwestern, once
the official sanction was given.
Supplies llndly Needed.
The postions taken by tho advance
forces of General Pershing made
some new routing of supplies abso
lutely necessary and Carranza's per
mission to use the railroad for tho
transportation of supplies was wel
comed as relief even though bearing
the handicap of the conditions "ship
as commercial freight."
It had been realized for several
days that some method other than
that of moving supplies by motor
trucks over a sandy route of morn
than 250 miles would have to be se
cured unless the expedition were to
be placed In Jeopardy. General Fun
ston had waited anxiously for almost
a week for the granting of his re
quest nnd meanwhile the forces com
manded by General Pershing were
moving further and further Into the
Interior und rapidly placing them-

SENTENCED ONE DAY
FOR MANSLAUGHTER
Jury Inclined to Leniency
in Trial of Steve
Vronatz.
HAD THREE VERDICTS
Finding Claimed to lie the
Lightest Ever Returned
in Similar Case.
"We. the Jury, find Steve Vronatz
guilty of manslaughter in tho Bocond
degree, but In consideration of tho
time he has been con l ined in Jail rec
ommend that his punishment bo
fixed at one day in the county Jail."
After deliberating for nearly seven
hours, this w.is tho third and Una!
verdict to he returned and accepted
by Judge Conn Linn of tho district
court in the trial of Stevo Vronatz for
tho murder of Roy llurrows. Tlio
sentence Is probably the lightest ever
passed upon a prisoner tor second
degree manslaughter, but was even
heavier than thai which the Jury de
termined upon when they returned
their first verdict nt about 8 o'clock
last night Vronatz will lie sentenced
this morning and will be released
some tune during the day.
Two Verdicts Refused.
The first two verdicts brought Into
court by the Jurors proved contrary
to the penally provided by law.
Judge Linn refused to accept them
and sent the Jurymen back to their
room.
The first verdict found Vronatz
guilty of manslaughter and set his
punishment at one year in Jail, but
asked thut the time ho has been
confined In Jail be deducted from
his sentence. It was found that he
had been confined in the county Jail
jist six day: more than a year
and the Jury wan sent back.
Aftor another hour or so another
verdic t was read in which Vronatz
was found guilty of manslaughter
and recommended that he be ronfined
In the county jail until April 1. This
verdict was also refused by the court
and ugaln the jury was sent back,
' Asked to I to Discharged.
Before returning several Jurors pro
tested that It was Impossible to agree
on a verdict which took on any other
form and asked that they bo dis
charged. Judge Linn refused to do
this and ordered them to go back.
At about 9:40, after having made a
trip ot tlje Keystone rooms to visit
the scene of the murder and returned
two invalid verdicts the Jurors sent
word down to the bailiff that they
had arrived upon another decision.
The Jurors walked nlto the courtroom
nd offered their third verdict, which

PLANS for a uniform course of bi
ble study, the pupils of which
will be given scholastic credit In any
public school in Oklahoma, will be
presented to the general session of
the Oklahoma Statu Sunday school
association this afternoon for adop
tion as the one, official, statewide
movement to be inaugurated by this,
the twenty-third annual convention.
The bill probably will feature a
program of business activities as many
Items arc scheduled to be brought be
fore the afternoon meeting. Impor
tant among the official business will
be selection of state officers for the
coining year, adoption of a new con
stitution anil resolutions, forming the
platform of the convention and asso
ciation. This Is the last of the three days'
session and tonight's meeting will
close a conference boasting the great
est attendance, the most remarkable
program and the most significant re
sults that have ever attended an
Oklahoma convention.
2..-.00 Are Here.
It Is now estimated that there are
2.500 delegates to the convent Ion,
making it far In advance of any gath
ering ever held in this state and fully
one thousand over the expected num
ber. Not more than five hundred of
these delegates are Tulsans. hence
there are two thousand out of town
pilgrims in attendance.
The registration committee shows a
total of l.riuo visitors, but II is esti
mated that there are at least five
hundred who have not uffixed their
names to the official records. Marlon
Lawrance, who is In dose touch with
the situation, announced from tho
rostrum yesterday that he considered
there were fully two thousand repre
sentatives of foreign districts in the
city.
Tho Plan of bible study correlated
with tho public school system is a
distinct Innovation in Sunday school
activities and Is fully In keeping wi'-l
the forward spirit of Oklahoma. The
advantage of the plan Is that the bibb
clusses are to be conducted by the
Sunday schools and credited by the
public schools after proper examina
tion ns to the efficiency of the course.
The theory already has been given
a favorable reception by the statu
board of Instruction and will be Im
mediately taken before t If the con
vention so directs. The committee
which has drafted the details of the
plan and which explained it to the
executive committee yesterday Is t
(!. Murphy, Oklahoma City: D. I
Johnson. Oklahoma City, and Dr. W
S. Wiley, Muskogee.
In Vogue In Tulsa.
Tho system has created a success
ful precedent in North Dakota, Indi-J
ana anu cniorauo. ine luisa puoiu:
schools have realized the practicabil
ity of it and have festered, several
classes of the kind within the past
vear. all of which are now running.
Tho plan Is in accordance with the
idea of a more complete and broader
education. II is in keeping with the
marvelous development of curriculum
which has been seen III tho past five
years, with the addition of tho In
tensely pnicticul courses, mechunical
training, business and professional
teaching. In short It is now the be
lief that practically everything is
taught in the modern school with the
exception of the bible. Keeling that it
is better qualified to conduct such
clusses the Sunday schools are offering
to fill this need for the educators. It
also lends a Roundness and founda
tion to the general system of bible
study In the Sunday school.
Much Oratory Today.
In addition to the many mat let s of
business to be brought up today the
program presents an unusual outlay
of addresses, this being the last
chance before adjournment tonight.
Tho next 12 hours probably will be
the busiest ones of the entire con
ference. Three departmental meetings will
be held this morning. II. T. Laugh
bauni will be the speaker at a tem
perance division at the Prcsbyterlun
church and the missionary depart
ment will meet In the Huston avenue
Methodist church. J. Shreve Durham
will make his first uppearanre at the
conference of the homo and visitation
workers.

FIRST SOPPLIES TO
PERSHING THIS A.M.
Forage Food and (iasoline
Will Leave Kl P'iso for
Casas (irandes Today.
WILL BE A LONG TRIP
Will Ileuire Hours to
Negotiate the 1G8
Miles.
EL PASO, Texas, March 2 A. Tho
first train bearing supplies to
General Pershing's troops ut tho front
probably will leave Juarez somo tlmo
tomorrow. Immediately on receipt of
the news from Washington that Gen
eral Carranza had permitted tho use
of the Northwestern railroad for tho
sending of supplies, final preparations
were rushed by tho quartermaster's
department for tho forwarding of
forage, food and gasoline.
The limitations imposed by General
Carranza, confining shipments to
goods sent to concerns in Mexico who
have contracts with the expedit biliary
force caused some disappointment
among army officers, it was feared
that these restrictions coupled with
the fact that military guards could not
accompany the trains might seriously
hamper tile transmission of an ade
quate stream of supplies.
Trains Run Slowly.
The Northwestern lines between
herj and Casas (irandes, near which
town General Pershing has estab
lished his principal base tu Mexico,
are admittedly In a bad way and make
the pussage of the trains very slow.
The equipment of tho road Is also
poor.
At the best of times a train leaving
Juarez took eight to ten hours to
negotiate the 1K miles to Casas
Grandes. At, present members of the
quartermaster's staff believe the trip
will not bo made in less than twenty
Iwo to twenty-five hours.
This, however, will be a consider
able improvement over the lime made
by the motor truck trains operating
from Columbus.
Permission for the full use of the
Northwestern railroad would mean
that the border base of General
Pershing's expedition would be
shifted from Columbus to Kl I'aso.
This step, however, will not be taken
under the present circumstances and
in any event it is planned to continue
the motor truck trains us at least a
supplementary service.
No Clash Soon.
The complete absence of any dif
ferent news of tin: pursuit of Villa
has caused u noticeable slackening of
interest ill the case as far as the
border Is concerned. It Is practically
accepted here thut the bandit has
eluded his pursuers ut least for the
present and that no clash between
the VUllstas and American troops can
be expected in the Immediate future.
Klglil Americans who came to Kl
Paso from Chihuahua City when the
I'nlted Stales soldiers crossed the bor
der returned to the Mexican slate
capital today. They said they felt
certain that all danger of molestation
had passed. J. W. Hammond, one of
the party, said:
"Wu do not think that Villa will
make any ndvance towards Chihuahua
Ctiy under present conditions. As
far as the constitutionalist authori
ties are concerned they have ulways
been courteous to us."
Fifty Americans In all came to this
city from the Interior when General
Pershing started in pursuit of Villa.

NKW ORLKANS, La., March 29.
Deprecating Indiscriminate at
tacks on corporations and criticizing
such legislation as the Sherman anti
trust law, tho seaman's act and tho
federal trade commission enactment,
George W. Simmons of St. Louis ap
pealed to tho business men of tho
nation to take a more active part In
political affairs, in an address be
fore the National Association of Reul
Kslalo Kxchnngcs hero today.
Mr. Simmons also scored the policy
of tho Interstate commerce commis
sion, which, he said, "has denied to
the railroads the privilege of earning
a fair compensation for services per
formed." lie declared It tho duty of
the government to take the railroads
under protection as well us control
und see that they receive a fair
price for transportation.
Attacks on Itoslne-s.
Mr. Simmons said attacks on cor
porations sevilal years ago so in
fluenced public opinion that the peo
ple seemed to forget "big business"
had any rights.
"All thinking men today admit that
much In nefii accrued to the country
from the reform movement winch
turned us aside from our undemo-
cratic tendency and helped establish
I a new and more thoroughly American
code of business elhics but the ques
tion now urises: Have we over
done it ? '
lie declared the Sherman law "con
verts the progress of business Into
a crime," dcsciihid the seaman's act
as "a striking illustration of theoreti
cal, Impractical legislation" and the
federal trade commission law, he said,
was "another example of the kind of
legislation which Indicates that we
may be progressing backward."
Mr. Simmons disclaimed any inten
tion to reflect upon the Individual
members of the present trade com
mission, but on the conlrarv, praised
Ibelr work as an assistance

CLKV KLAND, Ohio, March 29.
With u toll of at leust thirty per
sons dead und forty or more Injured,
federal and state officials und offi
cers of the railroad companies begun
today an Investigation Into tho cause
that led early this morning to one of
the most disastrous wrecks that has
occurred In this stale in a dozen years
ami one of the worst In the history
of the New York Central system.
Three trains, Including the Twentieth
Century Limited, west bound, tho New
York Central's palatial flyer and two
sections of No. 86, known us the Chi-cugo-Pittsbiirgh
Limited, east bound,
cumo together in collision near
Amherst, Ohio, 33 miles west of Cleve
land. Reports generally credited wore
that the first and second sections of
No. 8li were proceeding at a rapid rato
and ut some points were only u mile
or so apart. When the second section
crashed into the first section the
Twentieth Century Limited plowed
Into the wreckage of tho first two
trains which bulged over from the
parallel tracks.
The day loaches and enclnes of
No. XH were toppled over and wreck
age was idled thirty feet in tho uir.
Two cars were smashed to Junk.
Fourteen coaches overturned.
Tho Twentieth Century nothwith
standlng its impact with the debris
from the other trains, emerged al
most unscathed and proceeded on its
westward journey, Its passengers un
injured except for a severe shak
ing up.
A pall of fog from Uike Krle hud
settled down over northern Ohio and
the night was of almost inky darK
ness. This with the alleged failure of
a toweruian to do his duty under the
rules was ascribed by some of the
railroad officials as the cause of tho
wreck. The towermun, it was said,
had been without sleep most of the
time since Sunday night, his wife be
ing III and requiring his attention
when he was not on duty.
