Do You Want to
Sell Your Farm
TF YOU DO, and your price and terms are reason
able, we can sell it. If we think your price is too
high, we will tell you so. Remember, we do not
want to list tarms that we know we cannot sell for
the purpose of tying up the farm. We want a live
active list of good farms that will sell. We cannot
make a dollar by simply listing—we refuse a great
many listings—it's the selling that counts. Our or
ganization of bringing buyers is second to none in
the Northwest. If there is any business going, we
will get our share. If we didn't think we could sell
your land, we would not spend money advertising
for it. We have customers now in sight for 160,
240, 820, 640, 960, 1280, 1600 and 1920 improved
sarms. We don't list land all over the State, but
only want farms in Cass, Traill, Steele, Griggs and
Barnes Counties where we are operating. Now is
the time to list while we are here. We may be op
erating many miles from here by next year.
