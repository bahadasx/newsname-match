PAPER MILL IN NEAR FUTURE
DefinateAnnouncment
Will Be Made In Few
Weeks--Will Give Em
ployment To 150 More
Men
The officers and directors of
the Louisiana Fibre Board Co.
who left yesterday afternoon,
have decided to double the ca
pacity of the plant and will
take up the matter with the to
stock holders at once. As most la;
of the stock is owned by those he
who were at the meeting there al
is no doubt that the enlarge- he
ment of the local plant will be se
made as outlined at this meet- th
ing, and work will most likely er
start within sixty days. Addi- pa
tional buildings will be erected er,
and more machinery purchas- cu
ed, and when the new mill he
opens it will give employment Di
to 100 or more men. p.
Bogalusa has been entertaining
almost a score of Northern capita- he
lists and prominent business men td
this week who are here to inspect te
their million dollar investment in H
the paper milL The party arrived ti
Tuesday morning and it was the la
first visit for most of them to the tc
Magic City and it is needless to say ri
that they were given an agreeable im
surprise to find such a hustling H
manufacturing city and one of the d:
most modern paper mill plants in ai
the country. The party is headed fa
by Col. Geo. R. Wright, President of he
the Louisiana Fibre Board Co., of pi
Chicago and G. H. Wood V. P., and
Gen. Mgr., from Monroe Mich.
Others in the party are C. S. Wood.
Frank Walter, of Monroe, R C. Hall fý
and S. Cole, of Chester Ill., Jas. S. w
Wilson, L. L. Cooke, R. Deulany, C. p
0. Reynolds and Chas. F. McLean, of st
Chicago, Chas. Shuler, of Davenport, w
Ia., Thos. B. Johnson, of Madison Ia., o:
and C. L. Miller of Rockford Ill. tl
They were shown over the city
being almost as well pleased with it
as they were their mill. All are
optimistic over the outlook for a
prosperous year and the demand n
for the product of the local plant is c
far greater than the output. The ii
output has been contracted for six d
months and a two years contract a
refused. d

MANY BRAVE STORM
TO HEAR JINO PARKER
Says lie Wants Constitu
tional Convention And
Short Ballot
The weather man did his utmost
to break up the Parker meeting on
last Saturday night, but despite the
heaviest downpour of rain for sever
al months, a crowd estimated to
have been between 200 and 300 as
sembled at the Y. M. C. A. to hear
the Progressive candidate for Gov
ernor, discuss the issue of the cam
paign. And the address of Mr. Park
er, is said to have been the cleanest
cut confined to the issues than any
he has made during the campaign
Dr. E. A. Pierce introduced Mr.
Parker in a few well chosen words.
Mr. Parker stated that the reason
he was a Progressive was because
the Democratic party gave no pro
tection to the farmers and planters.
He compared labor conditions in
this country with those in foreign
lands, and showed what he believed
to be impossible for the growers of
rice, sugar, cotton, grain, etc.. to
meet the prices of foreign countries.
He then stated that the only reme
dy was to have a protective tariff,
and that this, the Democrats had
failed to do. For these reasons,
he said, he joined the Progressive
party.
SHORT BALLOT WANTED
Mr. Parker stated that he was in
favor of a short ballot, in other
words, he approved of having the
. people elect the governor of the
F state, and that the chief executive
was then to appoint all the state
officers, from Secretary of state to
the Commissioner of Agriculture.
WANT'S CONSTITUTION
AL CONVENTION
He dwelt at some lengths on the
I necessity of having a constitutional
convention, and gave the manner
in which he would like to have the
delegates selected, their vocation
t and the number. He favors 25
delegates to be selected from each
congressional district and at large
from the state.
USELESS OFFICES ABOLISHED
Mr. Pleasant stated that if he
I was elected governor, that he would
do all in his power to have many
of what he termed, as useless offices
e abolished, and, in that way, he ex
pected to save the tax payers of
the state, many thousands of dollars
s each year. He also favors the
fixing ofa salary for the sheriffs
e througout the state, and to not per
smit them to any fees. He compared
e the salary of the school teachers to
If the game wardens, and the impor*
Stance of each to their community,
si MUCH ENTHUSIASM
The meeting is said to have been
e very enthusiastic, and that Mr.
Parker was delighted with the re
ception he received in this city.
:k During his address he did not in.
Sdulge into personalties as has been
his custom, and the only name
mentioned was that of Robert Ew
- ing, whom he termed as the "Big
id Boss."
