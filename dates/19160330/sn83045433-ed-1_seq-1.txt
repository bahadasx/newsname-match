The gravity of the problem %
because of the imperiling of Ameri
was further increased vesterday.
The State Department late ye

town, Ireland:
"British stcamer Eagle Point

T he Department immediately c
to ask the German government for
7egarding the case.
German Denial Expected.
Earlier in the day it had sent him in
4tructions to ask about the British
steamer Manchester Engineer, reported
:orpedoed with two Americans on board.
Dn Tuesday the department directed him
:o ask regarding the alleged torpedoing
>f tne Channel liner Sussex and the
'teamship Englishman. Several Ameri
,ans on the Sussex were injured.
It was indicated last night by of
icials close to the German Embassy that
Berlin's answer will be unqualified denial
:hat German submarines torpedoed any
3f the unarmed merchantmen which
aave been sunk recently. The general
s ewpoint, it was stated, was that the
Sussex and the Englishman and the
Tubantia certainly, and the others, in
all likelihood, were victims of British
floating mines pyhich had been torn loose
from their moorings by the recent mine
laying operations of the British in the
English Channel. the March storms over
all the stretch of the western Europe
coastline having been unusually severe
this year
Diplomatic Break Likely.
Germany's denial that any of her
submarine commanders would so far
disobey orders as to torpedo an un
arnied passenger ship like the Sussex
will be strengthened, it is stated, by
the fact that Admiral Von Tirpitz
was recently withdrawn as head of
the German navy.
While the State Department waits
with anxiety for some authoritative
word from Mr. Gerard, rumors are rife
that the President contemplates some
decisive step that may lead to a break
in diplomatic relations between this
government and Germany.
The calm judgment of the depart
ment, however, as summed up by a
,onservative official, is as follows:
1. If it is proved that Germany is
Ignoring the rules of recognized in
ternational law. as upheld by this
government, and Is torpedoing vessels

must send the German government
an ultimatum.
Ultimatum to Be lassaed
Second-This ultimatum would be to
the effect that upon the occurrence of
any other vilation of irternational law
by a submarine against a vessel on
which there Is an American citizen, the
United States must break off diplomatic
relations with 6srmany.
Third--The ultimatum would necessarily
Include a statement that as the United
States cannot be forced to suspend its
commercial relations with Europe. It
must take such steps as it deems neces
sary to safeguard those commercial In
terests in the areas threatened by the
submarines of the central powers.
Fourth-The ultimatum would be de
cided on by the State Department and
the President and submitted by him.to
the leaders in Congress.
Fifth-There would then follow a state

London, March 29.-The German army

advance against Verdun. from the north
west, it is officially admitted by the
French war ofei tonight.
The Germans stormed French positions

mile and a quarter, penetrating to a
depth of several lines and entering the
village Itself. It is their greatest gain
of a week in the drive on the Paris-Ver
dun Railway, main artery of supplies for
the fortress.
In a counter-offensive in the Avocourt

yards, carrying a strongly fortified re
doubt. Four German counter-attacks
were repulsed.
Met by Furious Fire.
When the massed ranks of Germans
swept forward north of Malancourt
the French retired in good order
from their advanced positions, while
from rear trenches their comrades
poured a devastating fire into the ad
vancing legions. From cleverly con
cealed emplacements the 75's tore
great gaps in the German ranks.
Sweeping over the wrecked trenches
the Germans pressed forward Into the
outskirts of Malancourt. They were
met with such a furious fire that the
attack broke up. leaving them in pos
session of only two outlying houses.
Large forces of fresh troops, to date
estimated at 60,000, have made their
appearance in the renewed fighting
north of Verdun. Two new French
divisions were employed on the Ma
lancour-.Mne. according to the German
statement while the French report the
presence of fresh German organiza

"This so-called confession of Waite
was made public by the district attor

that puts Dr. Waite in a wrong light. He
was made to may things he never in

"Will not the defense of Waite be

replied Mr. Deuel. "I bad a long talk
with him today following my extended

seemed especially clear and logical. The
effects of the drugs from which he has
been suffering have evidently worn off.
The murder guilt of Arthur, Warren
Waite is so well established in the Judg
ment of District Attorney Swann-estab
limbed not merely by a well linked chain
of ircumstantial evidence, but by con
femsions which were amplified today
that the Investigation is now turning to
indications of blackmail and conspiracy.
The person most wanted in this connec

for John S. Potter. who Is accused of re

The disappearance of Kane made nec
essary, in Judge Sann's opinion, long
and detailed questions of Kane's em
ployer, John S. Potter. as to whether or
not Waite had told the truth in saying
that Potter was aware of the scheme to
deceive justice and save Waite's life by
putting arsenic in samples of the con

and Assistant District Attorney Dooling
Questioned Potter and were assured by
him that he knew no more about the
