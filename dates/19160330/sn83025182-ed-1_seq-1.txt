At the conclusion of the speeches,
the progressive liberal party offered a
resolution to postpone indefinitely the
resolutions designed to hamper the
chancellor In his dealings with Amer

the government should make no agree

the use of submarine, except with
respect to passenger carrying ships.
If any attempt is made to revise
these resolutions in the relchstag the
progressive liberals will move an
amendment. For the last sentence

submarine weapon shall be reserved
in negotiation with foreign nations,"
they will offer as a substitute the

the submarine against Germany's en

Though the government is expected
to issue some sort of statement on

KEOKUK NEWSPAPER MERGER
On and after April 3, 1916, The Daily date City and
Constitution-Democrat will be issued as a consolidated news
paper. This arrangement is in line with the action of progres
sive publishers in all parts of the country, where excessive
and rapidly increasing expenses of production have created
a situation which would absolutely compel a material raise in
subscription and advertising prices, if papers were continued
as separate editions. It is a frank statement of fact iort
that such a situation has existed in Keokuk, and tb )otli
local newspapers reached a critical point some time af /hen
it become absolutely necessary either to ask their bu! tbers
and advertising patrons for more money, or to red their
expenses in some manner. On page four of this issv 5 to be
found a list of 129 papers which have consolidated in the
last three years, and as this is only a small percent 8 of the
total number, it will be realized that the plan ados here is
no innovation.
The Keokuk consolidation is mutual and voluntary and!
there is positively no question but that it will result in pro
nounced benefit to local merchants and the community in
general, besides enabling the publishers to solve a very difficult
financial problem. It will require some time to perfect all plans
for such a union of interests, but they will be completed as
rapidly as possible, with the best interests of the city kept
constantly in mind.
Tho political policy of the consolidated paper will bo non
partisan and independent. The political news of all parties
will be printed impartially and without bias.
The paper will be published every week-day, an edition
being issued on Saturday instead of Sunday morning. The
subscription rates will remain the same as when the papers
Were issued separately, ,10c per week by carrier and $3.00
per year by mail. Subscriptions which have been paid in ad
vance will be credited in full. For the combined circulation
the advertising rate will be 25c. per inch on contract and 40c
per inch without contract, a saving to advertisers of 5 and 10c
per inch respectively. The consolidation will give the pub
lishers opportunity to print a better newspaper and thus the
readers will benefit also.
Mr. C. F. Skirvin, present publisher of The Daily Gate
City, will act as general manager of the combined properties,
and Mr. C. E. Warwick, formerly general manager of the

raid Daniels, "that 7,500 enlisted men,
2.500 apprentice seamen, 2,152 ship
corps men and 2.000 marines be
added to the navy. This would make
14,150 additional men, bringing the
total personnel of the navy to 67,952.
"The general board. laft July
recommended 11,000 additional men.
In November the board recommended
an increase of 14,000 men. When I
made this estimate for 14.152 men
last October, I had only the Ju-y
recommendation before me.
'T want to advise the committer,
the officers of the navy who have tes
tified here have given only their per
sonal views. Some of them have fig
ured on the basis of every ship ip
the navy being in constant commis
sion. This is not in accordance with
the policy of the navy- When a ship
goes to the navy yard, they contend.
It chould maintain its full quota of
men. To this I have two objections
first, to have such a large force on
the ship with only a few duties to
perform, would be highly demoraliz
ing second, they should be put on
an active vessel so their training
iwould not relax. For these reasons

This merger has required a heavy investment on the
part of the above named, and the hearty support of all citizens
is earnestly solicited. With the co-operation of the general
public, which is to be expected, it will be possible to produce
a publication that will reflect great credit on the city, county

.the department has adopted the
policy of having only forty percent of
I the crew on vessel in tho navy
yard.
"former Secretary Von Meyer left
only thirty-three percent of the men
Ion ships not in active commission."
Daniels lighted figures to show how
I difficult it. was to keep up enlisted
I strength in the navy. He said five
out of every six applicants are re-
Jected. The enlistments of 12,875
men. on tho average, expire every
year.
"We have been very liberal lately
in permitting the purchase of dis
charges." said Daniels. "In 1913.
15,556 men left the service in 1914,
I 13,213. and in 1915 there were 17,157.
Many of those men are not entitled
to re-enlistment and the average
wastage of men is 6,000 a year. Up
to three years ago, the percentage of
I wastage was fifty-four last year it
was seventy-five. To Increase the
navy 15.00O men next year we would
have to enlist 21,000 new men in ad
Idition to the re-enlistment. This

would mean examination of approxi
mately 14,000 applicant*."
It is estimated that hundreds of
tons of food and forago alone are re
quired daily for soldiers and horses
in the field, without recognizing gaso
line and food requirements of troops
guarding tlio line of communication.
Some of those transportation prob
lems now regarded as tho most
urgent phases of the expedition, has
for a time overshadowed the pursuit
of Villa, Interest in which has lagged
on account of lack of official news.
While the United States troops
were Inst reported pursuing Villa
through tho Santa Maria valley and
trying to get south of him via Ma
dera, the total absence of news of
Oarranza operations aftor tho arch
bandit was puzzling. Wires south of
