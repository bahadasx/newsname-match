chief, Coupled With Simi
larity of Descriptions,
Confirms Him In His Sus.-
picions. ,
The mystery of the well-dressed un
., known who hanged himself ina lonely
, part of a wood near Woodmont and
whose body has lain unclaimed In the
Milf ord morgue about a week, may be
solved' by the Milf ord police. '."
. Sheriff" George E. Mallory 'of that
town believes the body is that of Jean
' Crones, sought by the police of the
' country in the belief that he tried to
'poison the soup of banqueters in Chi
. cago. . -. .- ,.' :' ' ' '
The descriptions of the body and of
Crones tally almost in every detail.
Information has been forwarded to the
,i police of Chicago and a detective of
- that city 'will come East to view the
man- in the Milf ord morgue. '-''"-
The only difference in the "descrip
. tion is that the eyes of Crones were
brown while those of the man in the
Milf ord morgue are blue. Undertaker
Geforge . J. Smith', in charge of the
body, says there is a possibility of the
eyjes changing color, "due to -Strangu-
.lation. "-,:- -; ,"- -
, He said that when a man is strangled
of times a bluish film Rovers the eye
y balls and. it is possible that this
change In features may have occurred.
' Another difficulty tci be encountered in
' identifying the body as that of Crones
' is that the hair of the Milford body-Is
black while that of Crones was brown.
1 Police say that it; is likely Crones dyed
i . his hair.y-,-.; ( ':...
The body was found Saturday morn
ing. It' was taken to the Smith
morgue, opposite the Milford Green.
Sheriff, Mallory Viewed, it 'last- night
- and he is inclined to belieyethat it; te
that ! of "Crones. ' V
' The man. wore a dark gray suit
i manufactured, by Adler & Co., of Chi
cago,. He ..appears to be about 2
years of age, -five vfeet eight ' inches . in
height and weighed a little more than
150 pounds. In the pocket of his coat
.was found a bandkercnief bearing the
. initial "3EC" There was a. rone-inch
scar over his right eye. He wore a
light green'fedora hat, size seven and
had on dark buttoned shoes, size nine;
He wore a brown, tie with orange col
ored' spots.' ; .-. - ' : :';- -i-'--V-'''
He wore a brown leather .belt with
a -white enameled buckle. . His hair
wasntedlum- brown, turning, black.
His "teeth were good and his. hands
wefe'very soft, as though he had done
- little manual labor.; His cheek hones
were very prominent. He had never
been seen before, in Milford and hun
dreds of residents of JMilford who
viewed the body were unable to iden
tifyvhim.;V .: : ; '-'' 'v ' - r";.;-
The description of Crones as for
warded by tie Chicago police depart
ment to the , local police-- authorities
r was as follows: Age. 2 5 to 27weight
.. 150 pounds; - height- five .feet - seven
inches; stooped brad shoulders;
black curly hair; scar over right eye;
prominent cheek , bones and wore a
light green fedora hat. - He also iwbre

FIFTH DISTRICT
BEGINS TO SHOW
SIGNS OF SCRAP
While th only" contest at the Re
publican primaries . ls in the Sixth
distrl tonight there- Is- a rod in
pickle for County Commissioner Frank
E). Ballard because of the manner in
which , the -delegates from the Fifth
district were named. The delegates
are GJuy P. Miller, Benjamin B.1 Stei
ber and Harrison Davis. There Is no
objection to Messrs. ... Miller or Davis
but there is objection to Mr. ' Steiber
being on :the '' .ticket because It is
claimed that he. is neither a member
of the district, club, or a worker in the
district, . ' . ' ' .
The objectioni to ythe whole ticket
however, hinges on the " fact that
that Chairman .'Ballard did not call
any caucus of the district as was done
In every other district except the. Sixth
where Chairman Cunningham pursued
the Ame tactics. -v" As a result there
is a contest in the Sixth and the fac
tion opposing the administration wilL
win. '" ' . , - "v ' '
Mr. Ballard as county commissioner
has been accompanying John- C. Stan
ley, president of the police board, on
raids . on different saloons about - the
city. I It is -charged,-although Com
missioner Ballard ..denies it, that when
the- Wieler saloon in Main street was
raided, Saturday . night, , one of the
women taken' in the raid became hys
terical and that Commissioner Bal-r
lard suggested her release.-,
At any rate there is much sore
ness among, the Republican politicians
in the NFlfth and the residents of. the
Brooklawn district, headed by Albert
H. Canfield, .had planned to place another-ticket
in-opposition to ,the Bal
lard ticket when they discovered they
were. too late. , Neither Judge of Pro
bate Miller, .'Assistant Town .'Clerk
Clarence E.Wiqton.-E.. J. Naylbr of the
paving efnd sewer commission or any
of the leading workers in the district
were consulted by Mr. Ballard before
he . named his ticket..
Under the party rules fvery dele
gate ticket mustbe advertised for
three days before the primaries are
held Under the caption of "Regular
Republican Nominations" these names
appear to.be voted for delegates from
the Sixth district: Fred JH. Daniels,
Patrick J. Reillly and John F. Mur
phy. The opposition ticket, which is
placed carefully far and away from the
other delegate ticket in the advertise
ment. Is: Iewis C. Willis, Lewis F.
Blair and Oscar I Johnson.
Nevertheless, old timers in the dis
trict predict that the latter ticket will
win.- I

REPORTED IN RAID
WHILE IN RETREAT
Villa .Faces Danger of Be
tray Now That There is
Price on Head.
El Paso, March 30. Military author
ities mia.de no secret of their belief to
day that Francisco Villa had slipped
through .the cordon of American troops
and Carranza forces pursuing . him in
Mexico,
A report that "Villa 6n Tuesday had
raided Santa Tomas, south of Naml
quipa, .became .current here today but
was not credited. Neither General
Gaviera, commander of the Juarez
garrison, nor Mexican Consul Garcia
had received any advices from Mexico
and officers of the Mexican-Northwestern
railroad -said they had no lnfor
mation regarding the reported raid. (
The latest information was that the
bandit leader was moving through the
Santa Maria valley. Once among his
peon friends who probably would give
American troops 'misleading informa
tion regarding his whereabouts, Villa
might escape detention for a long time
it was pointed out. .
Roving- bands .of Villa men are re
ported everywhere in the 'region of
Santa Maria valley but apparently the
American flying columns , have not
come in contact with him. . ' '
Mexican officials safd toQay they had
no news as to the whereabouts of Villa
but that the troops of the de facto
government are aiding the American
soldiers in an attempt to capture him.
Ranchers from the Chihuahua dis
trict said today that when it became
known there was a price on Villa's
head dead or alive the bandit would
be in constant danger of betrayal.
Whether the American troops have
made it known that there is a reward (
for Villa has not been, learned here
among the peon population. '
Brig.. General Bell, commandant at
Fort Bliss, awaited official orders to
day to ship supplies to the army oxr
the Mexican-Northwestern roaS.
Meanwhile,. 'Major Elliott,. 'depart
ment quartermaster. Is mdving sup
plies in great quantities to Columbus,

Ten carloads were shipped to Colum
bus today and ten new motor trucks
were also, sent to the army base "there.
Twenty-seven more motor trucks -will
go forward today. ,. t
. Army officers here believe that 'Co
lumbus will be. continued as -an aux
iliary base- for the American army.
They point' out that rvo great reliance
can be placed on the Mexico-Northwestern
railroad as' a sole line of com
munication because its "conditions to

league from the Cameron ' estate, by
James T. Collins.a railway mail clerk,
was announced today. Mr. Collins is

to mean that there will be league

Child Bride Sorry .
Now She Said, "Yes"
One of the romances piloted by the
guiding hand of Assistant Town Clerk
Winton came .to grief" today when
Frieda Assaf of Brooklyn, N. X., asked
the superibr court to annul her mar
riage to Galieb Assaf of this city.
The girl was only 16 old when she
and Assaf visited the city hall Feb. 27,
1915, and asked to have the knot tied.
She was too young to realize how
serious a problem marriage is, she de
clares. Another' ground for annul
ment is the fact that the ceremony was
performed without the consent of the
girl's parents or of Mayor Wilson. The
child wife is not living with her hus
band at present. !

COST $2,000 TO
GET' CONVICTION
IN HAfNES pASE
Alienists Qet Big Fees For
Expert Testimony in
V Murder Trial.- .
It cost the state, between $1,900 and
$2,000 to convict Jason S. Hains of
murder in the second degree. The
greater part of this money was paid!
to alienists retained by. the state to
prove that Haines was in his - right
mind when he killed his .wife. Dr.
John C. Lynch was paid $550 and Dr.
David M. Trecartin received thesame
amount, Dr. F. . W. Stevens, who is
also' the! county jail physician, was
paid $250. . x
The remainder of the expense ac
count was distributed for witness fees
and other small items. Dr Lynch and
Dr. Trecartin were in court every . day
during the trial seated near State's
Attorney Cummings' ' where they
prompted when medical questions were
beino- discussed. v i
Haines also had. Dr.' Diefehdorf, theS
noted alienist; and his fee was prob
ably $500 or $600 at, least. This ex
pense was of course borne by Haines
as well as the cost of retaining Attor-.
ney Jacob B. Klein. The trial would!
have beenj cheaper for the state if
Haines hacf not set up the plea of
temporary insanity due to chronic al
coholism. - But when this defense was
set forth it was necessary for the
state to hire alienists to combat it. '
