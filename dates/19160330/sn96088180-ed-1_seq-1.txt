New York, Mar. 30 Denying the
demands of more than 300,000 train
men for an eight-hour day and in
creased wages for overtime work, the
affected railroads today submitted
counter-proposals shortly after the
employes' communication was re
ceived. The concerted action of the
roads was indicated by statements is
sued simultaneously at Chicago,
Cleveland and New York.
Cleveland, O., Mar. 30. Three
hundred and sixty thousand railroad
employes today submitted to 458
railroads demands for a basic eight
hour day and time and one-half pay
for overtime work.
Representatives of the railway
brotherhoods notified the general
managers thai a written answer was
expected by .April 29. Leaders said
that strike reports circulated in New
York were merely calculated to affect
the stock market, and that should
the railroad refuse the demands, ar
bitration would be the next logical
step.

ing that he had confederates outside.
The girl was overcome with fear and
it was many minutes before she noti

The bank was deserted except for
the presence of Miss Isenberg, assist
ant cashier, when the bandit 'enter
ed. He stepped to the window and
drew an automatic pistol from an
outside pocket of his coat
"Miss, it you make a sound I'll
be forced to kill you," the bandit
told her in a quiet voice. "Stay
where you are, appear to be working
and do not mind me. ,If you do "
The masked man waved his weap
on significantly. He at once, went
behind the counter, according to Miss
Isenberg, and went Into the vault.
As. near as can be estimated, 33,000
in currency and gold was taken.
' Sheriff MacMartln hurriedly or
ganized three posses and threw a net
about the immediate vicinity. The
robber had 15 minutes start of the
sheriff's men. A score of officers
were sent to the Santa Paula road at
the potnt where it enters the Ojai
valley, while another posse was sent
16 miles to the south to guard the
road there. These are the only two
roads which enter the Ojai valley,
and it Is believed the bandit must
take one of these to fly to the mountains.""-"""

Mr. Sanders, the manager of the.

the company is to buy aa much of

clear up and improve their ranches.
as it Is the wish to help the beet

All beet growers who hava wood
for sale should get in touch with toa-
company's office and send in a writ-
tea statement stating how many corda
of wood they want to sell, whera It
will be delivered, either at the fac
tory or at one of the railroad stations
where beets are shipped. In this
way the company will be able to make
up Its schedule si to how the wood
should be purchased. It is not prob
able that the beet growers can, front
their own places, supply all of this
wood, therefore the company Intends
next to purchase slabs from the near
by sawmills to the extent of their
production of slabs, and after that
it will then let wood contractors or
dealers furnish the balance of the
wood. . ...;.i ..J 'iiv.!
This wood should ail be cut prior
to August 1, so that it will be mora
or less seasoned before delivery. The
deliveries can be made at fixed in
tervals between the 1st of August
and the 1st of October; Persons
shipping wood by railroad . should
have the same delivered to the rail
road track ready to be loaded on cars
by the 1st of September. '.

The British embassy at Paris for
warded a statement from the Sussex
commander, in which he claims to
have seen the torpedo coming and
tried to escape It. He blamed most
of the fatalities to the Paula which
followed the explosion.
