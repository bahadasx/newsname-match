RESPOND TO
CALL FOR
RECRUITS
Major C'ha.ies N. Barney, U. S. A.,
retired, Ir. charge of the army recruit
ing stations in Oklahoma, was hero
yesterday from Oklahoma City for the
puipose of inspecting the local re
cruiting office which Is in charge of
Sergeant Crone. He expressed him
folf as well pleased with the result
of the work here, especially the char
acter ot the men that are enlisting.
- Under a recent order the regular
army Is to be Increased to full war
stntngth, affording an opportunity to
all young men who want to follow the
career of a aoldler. Durij the pawt
year 3000 men applied for enlistment
In Oklahoma and of this number 600
were accepted. With the opening of
b number or sun-stations in me siaie.
Including the one In Chickasha, Major
Barney reports a marked Increase In
the number of applicants.
"What I will say is hot official; It
not based on official knowledge,"
paid Major Barney, "but it is my be
lief that tho war department is not
only trin,t to prepare the army as
quickly as possible but is testing what
can be accomplished by volunteer en
listment for the regular army.
"Can we get enough men by volun
teer enlistment to support an army of
the size we needor will conscrip
tion become necessary? That is the
proposition, as I see it
"We are calling on Oklahoma to do
her part In this movement. -Oklahoma
not only can supply her share of
the additional soldiers that are need
ed by the country, but also can take a
part In proving that conscription wili
not be necessary."

SECRETARY
. IS WANTED
BY Y.W.C.A.
College Students Start Movement to Raise
Fnnds to Pay Salary of Trained
Worker; Co-operation of Citi
zens is Sought
(By O. C. W. Reporter.)
For the past few days much real in
terest hus been manifested in our col
lege about the propospd secretary for
cur Young Women's Christian asso
ciation: That brlnE up a discussion.
What is a Y. W. Secretary? Do we
need one? And what will be her
work?
. Theso are some of the questions
asked. Do you understand them, and
can you unswer them?
She is a college graduate who is es
pecially fitted for this work by study
in a training school and by practical
experience, who, upon receiving a suf
ficient salary may and docs devote
her whole time to the Y. WVs welfare.
She will be a good "mixer" and a ho
called "live wire." Herself an active
and interested Y. WTi worker, she will
compel and attract attention to her
f.eld of work. She is exactly what we
need.
The organization, to do our college
nny good, must keep us in touch with
Y. W.'s all over the country; thui
bringing us fresh Ideas and iwv
thoughts. It must be an aid to every
student, a sort ot "in loco parentis
for her while she is in school, because
this Is not a denominational school
and no church is in any way responsi
ble for tho spiritual growth of tha col
lege. All thee needs can be summed
up In "a Y. W. Secretary." The
growth and development of the local
order wii: be her sole care.
She will arrange pleasant social
events, she will manage the financial
affairs of the association, she will en
courage and broaden the field of so-
ciai'servico. and she will increase th
membership and stimulate a more ac
tive Interest in this democratic frater
nity ot women. She will meet and
make welcome new girls. Sho will
keep us in constant communieationo
with Ilka organizations.
Can all these things be done by a
student In the college? Can thes.j
things be done by someone who Is not
especially trained for that work?
No, they cannot. Hence, a paid sec
retary for the Y. W. C. A. Is absolute
ly neressary.
How la the money to be secured for
the Salary of such a secretary?
Id three ways may ihis be done.
First, through the efforts ot the O.
C W, students themselves..
Second, through the help ot their
faculty.
Third, through the co-operation ot
the citizens of Chickasha.
The most loyal efforts are coming
from the Y. W. members themselves.
Snail amounts of money are being
n,ude constantly, from the sale oj

DAMAGES
ARE SOUGHT
BY SHIPPER
Delay in Delivery of Stock Alleged as
Cause of Suit; Two Cases are De
cided Adversely to Railroad
Company
In the district court this morning
the trial ot the case of A. H. English
vs. the Rock Iand railway company,
through its receivers, was taken up
and the jury empanelled before the
noonday recess was taken.
In this case the plaintiff seeks to re
cover damages for a delay In ship
ment of stock over the lines of the de
fendant company, during the month
of February, 1915, from Rush Springs
tc Kansas City. Plaintiff alleges in
his petition that th5 railway company
J contracted to deliver the stock at the
Kansas City terminals within a spec
ified time and that it failed to do so
and that, owiug to this failure the
plaintiff was materially damaged
through changes In the live stock mar
kets. Defendant will offer as a defense
that its servants used every possible
means to comply with their part of the
contract, but that a severe storm was
raging at the time and that the rail
way company was badly handicapped
'in handling any and all freight trains
land that through this storm the dellv-
fery of the stock of the plaintiff was
J delayed.
The following jurors are trying the
case: J. S. Tatman, S. A. Forsythe,
Henry McWliorter, John Graham, S.
M. Canan, I. G. Wood,' Will Sanner, S
J. Harris, T. H. Bennet, R. A. Thomas,
T G. Gann.
In the matter ot C. L. Wood vs. the
Rock Island railway company, on
trial yesterday afternoon, the jury re
turned a verdict for the plaintiff,
awarding him $100 damages.
.In the matter of F.-K. Hardy vs. the
Rock Island railway company, also on
trial yesterday afternoon and a part
of this morning, plaintiff was given
judgment in the sum of $200.
In the case of English vs. the Rock
Island, now on trial, W'elborne and
Bailey are attorneys for the plaintiff,
while Barefoot and Carmichael rep
resent the railway company.

PERSHING
"MAN OF
SORROW"
Leader of Mexican Punitive Expedition
Lost Wife and Children in Blaze at
Frisco; Wins Battles by
Diplomacy
By United Press.
Washington, March 30. A fighting
soldier who wins battles ty diplomacy
is a ranty. But that is the distinction
accorded Brigadier General John J.
Jershing, the "man ot sorrow" of the
ar.ny, whoso beautiful wife and three
oaby girl children were burned to
death in" a fire that destroyed their
home in San Francisco, August 27,
1S15.
Many and picturesque are the tales
told of this Beau Brummel of the
army; a handsome," dashing soldier;
brilliant and bloody In battle, equally
brilliant in bloodless conquests; hero
of romance and strife; a linguist, dip
lomat, scholar; a man who won hla
rank as much through peaceful coil
quering of his enemies as through
t'aring leadership in military cam
paigns against them.
Pershing and the Philippines are
synonymous. It was Pershing, then
Captain Pershing, of the First, later
the Fifteenth, cavalry who drew tho
task of subduing the fanatical Moros
on Mindanao and Jolo., He was given
.200 men and free reign. Not one
of those men was sacrificed In battle, i
Instead of beginning a war of exter-l
ruination agaiiifct the ' Moros, Capt.
Pershing began a study of their lan
guage. Me soon mastered their tongue.
He assembled the Moros, fanatical
Moh.immpdauH. ' on Fridays, (their
Sundays), and taking texts from the
Koran, talked to .them on reconcilia
tion with the United States govern
ment. In this way, without fighting a
single battle, he won all but two of
the mountain tribes, and was conse
crated a Datto by the Sultans ot the
tribes.
Eut with the two tribes who spum
ed his effcrts at peaceful c.onsuest, he
showed relentless and crushing pow
er. Their strong mountain forts feil
before his onslaught until forty had
been captured and their last strong
hold taken. One hundred and seven
ty five Moros paid the extreme penalty
in battle for their folly. Only 13
American soldiers were wounded.
none kil'ed.
His conquest in Mindanao resulted
in Pershing's appointment as Adjutant
Genera! on that island and Jolo, and
Colonel Roosevelt, then president, sur
prised the entire army organization
by promoting him over tha heads of
SC. ranking officers to be brigadier
general. '
But his promotion came only after a
bitter struggle that threatened for a
time to blacken him forever. He had
married the daughter of Senator War
ren of Wyoming a year before promo
tion, in January, 1915. The wedding
was one ot the most brilliant social
1
affairs In the history of the eapltol.
Angry critlci;-;n aroie, some charging
that the promotion was due to favor
itism. Roosevelt, asserted that he did
not recall at all the fact the General
Pershing was a son-in-law of Senator
Warren when he promoted him.
Of his three little baby daughters
.ho were burned to death when his
wife lost her life, one was born in To
kyo. Japan, in 1906, while the then
Captain Pershing was military at
tache at the Japanese embassy; one
was born in Bagulo, Philippines, in
1908, and the youngest waa born in
Za,nboan;?o, Philippines, In 1912.
General Pershing's first fighting was
against the Indian outlaw Geronimo
on a punitive expeuition into Mexico
in the lato eighties. He later fought
against the Sioux Indians Jii the Da
kotas, served as military instructor of
cadets at the University of Nebraska,
and as administrator of affairs in the
provinces ot Mindanao and Jolo, Phil
ippine Islands. He speaks almost
every modern language, as well as the
tongues of many Indian and Philip
pine tribes. General Pershing wa3
sent to the Mexican border In 1912,
and served continuously there.
