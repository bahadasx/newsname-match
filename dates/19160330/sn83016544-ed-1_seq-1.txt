DAILY MAIL SERVICE
From Cranwr to HevlanS te Cn
nence May 1st.
Notices for posting have been re­
ceived by the Postmaster at Cramer
calling for bids on a daily mail ser­
vice from Cramer to Hovland, using
auto trucks during summer and
sleighs or* wagons during the win­
ter. The bids will have to be sub­
mitted before April 12th and the
service is to commence May 1st.
This is the result of petitions
which were sent out the first of the
year and is welcome news to the
whole county. Notices for posting
have not been received by the local
post office yet but are expected on
today's mail.
According to the report which we
received by telephone from the post­
master at Cramer, the mail will
leave there at one o'clock and arrive
Grand Marais some time in the
afternoon continuing to Hovland
the same afternoon, and returning
to Cramer the next noon.
The completion of the North
Shore i*oad has been a big factor in
getting the Post Office Department
to decide to give us daily mail ser­
vice and this is another evidence of

Local Scorn to be Shown in Mov­

F. R. Paine has received a letter
from E. J. Filiatrault of the Mutual
Auto Co of Duluth, which is of in­
terest, as follows:
"The writer has filially succeeded in
making arrangements with the Forci
Motor Co. to have them send their oom
plete moviug picture outfit to t)uluUi
with a view to driving from here tb
Grand Marais to take views of tlie roads
aud the scenic beauties of Lake Superior
between Duluth and Grand Marais.
'The writer, in presenting to them
logical arguments, advised that as a
climax to wind np their moving pictures,
undoubtedly arrangements could bi
made with you and Mr. McDonald, th#
taxidermist, to take some viewB of sonriit
of the beautiful moose heads you havtt
and other animals of the wilds of Cook
oounty.
'At your convenience, would yon ad*
vice if the writer can expect your co-ope­
rate in this regard, in having these
pictures taken? Please bear in mind
that they will be shown in almost every
town or city in the United States, as
there are hundreds of films made and
they are furnished gratis to moving
pictures companies who will run them.
It will be a most splendid opportunity
to advertise Cook county and the high­
way connecting Duluth and Port Arthur
"If you have any further suggestions
that von could make along this line, the
writer would be pleased to have such
suggestions.
"Do you think it would be possible to
take a view some time the latter part
of June or July of fishing industry?
As an illustration—a moving picture of
the fishermen bringing in their cateb,
the cleaning aud packing of fish, etc.
anything that would be interesting.
Again, perhaps by spending a day or
two back of Grand Marais on some of
the lakes, moving pictures could be
made of moose or deer along the lake
shore.
"With kindest regards, beg to remain,
Very truly yours,
E. J. FILIATRAULT."
Mr. Filiatrault is a good booster
for this county having driven the first
car through from Duluth to this
point and he will find that our citi­
zens will co-operate with him in get­
ting the best results for his films.

BUBRLES PUNCTURED.
Fallacies of Opposition to the High­
way Cosalcsion.
This comity has seen much of the
practical results of the present road
laws of the state and is in a pretty
good position to, judge the merits of
the present agitation iu other parts
for the abolition of the State High­
way
Commission. We are glad to
see that a Cook county citizen offers
his views on the situation, and we
reprint below a letter by County
Commissioner Engelson to the Du­
luth Evening Herald answering a
communication by one of the antts.
Mr. Engelson's letter is as follows:
-"I did not read George W. Cooley's
ftstement in the Herald concerning the
way Commission which stirred
^"onr Bruno correspondent, G. A. Swan
p, With the "varions emotions" that
copiously poured into the "Open
kWlrt" column of a recent edition of
fbijir paper. Apparently Mr. Swanson
hi amusing himself blowing bubbles
from a "Home Rule League" pipe. Such
emotional contributions may interest
some readers as literary productions,
tint to those who understand anything
of the real merits of the controversy
they should seem ridiculous. If he
were a "Mc" or an "O", the emotions of
this "Home Ruler" would be more un­
derstandable.
"This "Home Rule League" is an or­
ganization of township officials now
waging an agressive campaign for the
abolishment of the State Highway Com­
mission and as the reason for its
activity are pretty fully stated by Mr.
Swanaon, let us see whether or not they
are,
I have suggested, simply blowing
bubbles.
"I live in a county in which there is
not a mile of railway, and one whose
prosperity, therefore, more than any
other county in the state depends on
good roads. I am most emphatically for
good roads. I am for the system of road
building that promises the maximum of
seryiee for the minimum of coat and I
an^ponv&csed that to abolish the High
rap.Commission and hand its powers
vtr to the several town boards of the
stlte would be a long step backward
aul) little short of a crime.
"What do those "Home Rulers" want,
anyway? Town Boards still have entire
supervision over the building and main­
tenance of all town roads, and with this
iiithOnty neither the Highway Commis­
sion toor the county board can interfere.
"The State Highway Commission is
kiven Supervision (in co-operation with
the county board) only over those state
foitdii for which state aid is given. All
tuer state roads and all county roads
ri constructed by the county all state
foAds being maintained by the county
4nd all county roads being maintained
by the towns through which they pass.
The Commission has nothing to do with
the designation of state roauls, that be
in4 a power vested solely in the oounty
bokrds and the prime purpose of making
S Oounty road a state road is to secure
State aid.
"Towns are permitted a maximum tax
le*y of 21 mills for road purposes the
tiiAximum for counties being 3 mills, and
thfc maximum for the State only one
mill. Is it any infringement on the
tight of home rule for the State, through
iti Highway Commission, to supervise
tUfe expenditure of this comparatively
sdiall state allotment for road purposes?
If so, then the same objection lies
against the powers of the county boards
ill the matter, and the controversy vir­
tually reeolves itself into a proposition
to ttirti over obsolutely and entirely the
Wttrk of road building to the town
boards.
"Towns are relieved of the duty of
maintenance and uo-keep of county
roada as soon aa the aame are designa­
ted aa state roads. This duty, as stated
above, then devolves on the county, the
expense of which maintenance is shared
by the State.
"The Highway Commission has no
strings on the towns, but towns may
command the services of the Commis­
sion. Under the law it is the duty of
8{ete engineers, upon the request of a
town beard, "to advise and consult with
spell board in the construction or im­
provement of town roads to make plana
and specifications when so required to
exercise supervision oyer such construc­
tion or improvement, and lend every
possible assistance to the local road au
tborities in bettering the public bigh
fays."
"If we don't appreciate the State
igbway Commission it is because we
lb not avail ourselves of the help offer
the local authorities by our present
jplendid system of road building. Let
be fair. With the towns of the State
ndling at least fifteen times as muob

Potato Disease Threaten State
Under no conditions should pota­
toes from unknown sources be
bought for planting, says E. C.
Stakinan of the Minnesota College
of Agriculture. There is a great
danger of introducing powdery scab
of potatoes into the potato-growing
sections of Minnesota. But for the
intervention of state authorities, a
shipment of potatoes infected with
powdery scab would have been un­
loaded on the Mianneapolis market
recently. Had these potatoes been
planted, one of the most dangerous
diseases would probably have been
introduced into this section.
Powdery senb occurs in Main,
New York, Florida, Oregon, Wash­
ington, as well as iu Canada and
other foren countries. It is found
in the extreme northeastern part of
Minnesota. Importation of potatoes
from infected districts was forbidden
until recently. Maine was quaran­
tined when it was thought that the
disease existed iu no other slate.
Powdery scab is carried on the
tubers and may live in the soil six
or seven years. It can be disting­
uished by small, purplish blisters,
which break open and rupture the
skin of the potato, forming pustules
about an eighth of an inch in di­
ameter. Any potatoes suspected of
carrying the disease should be sent
to Plant Disease Section, University
Farm, St. Paul, for examination.
To avoid danger of introducing
this or other diseases, all seed po­
tatoes should be soaked an hour and
a half in a solution ot 4 ounces of
corrosive suhliniHte to 30 gallons of
water.
