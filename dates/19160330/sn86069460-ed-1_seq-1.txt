"The tumult and the thoutinff die;
The rtptaini and the king depart;
Still itandn thine ancient aacrifice,
A humble and contrite heart.
Lord Cod of llonti. be with ui yet,
Lt we forifet, let we forget. "
Vhile the Father-Lands are
locked in war's deadly embrace,
making use of every conceivable
device for taking human life
thus decreasing; the world's pop
ulation at the rate of thousands
per day, there is a "still Bmall
something" that is as surely but
more slowly decreasing the pop
ulation in Crittenden county. In
1900 our population was 15,191;
in 1910, 13,290; 12.5 per cent de
rrea?e. Where are they? I told
you week before last Why did
they go? You know. These are
government figures, and cannot
be denied.
"Lord God of Hoeu, Le with ui yet,
teat we forget, tat we forget"
At all of our teachers' associa
tions last year the text was,
"The Highest Function of the
School is Character-Building."
The individuals who art respon
ible for a good school, or a bad
one, arc first; the trustee, second;
the teacher, third; the parents,
fourth; and the county superin
tendent, fifth.
There was a time when the
trustee in a country district
school was looked upon as one of
the weakest Vessels in the com.
munity and one of the most de
piled because he had all the
taxes to collect, care for .the
school property and do all the
necessary work about the house
and grounds, gratis. Now it is
different somewhat He may be
paid for tome of his work. He
is looked upon aa a promoter of
the best interests of the county.
He may have under his control
the entire school interests of the
county. Actually he is permit
ted and earnestly solicited to at
tend the K. E, A. every year,
la truth, he is the real founda
tion of the county schools. You
will find some of the best men in
the county who are not ashamed
to own that they are trustees.
The duties of the trustee are
manifold and, some times, rex
ing. It is not the mission of
this article to delineate all his
duties, but I want to mention
this one, that of selecting a teach
er and PERMITTING her to
teach, his school.
I know H is sometimes hard to
select a good teacher, but too of.
' ten he looks at the task as "first
eorae. first served." or lib w
sed to do in the old game,
"Puss wants a corner," when
one jumps out the other jumps in.
This same trustee if he should
go to buy a pig, a calf, a cow or
even a young mule he will make
him stand in a corner, drive him
around the lot, look at him from
all sides and will ask. Question-
enough about him to fill the Crit
tenden Record-Press before he
will pay his money for him. Are
you half so much concerned about
whom you choose to shape the
character of your boy or your
girl-the future hope of the couu
try? The whole current of the
. life of a - pupil may be ehanired
in one hour's teaching, for the
right or for the wrong. Again,
we nave a few trustees who
think the school fund should be
ased for charity. .. His neighbor's
daughter is to poor drc o instances
and needs the money. He gave
her the school to help HER along
Poor little boys and girls at
school. Attain, "my daughter
holds a second class certificate,
and I thought she might teach
our school this year. She has to
learn to teach some where."
Poor suffering humanity De
luded mortals! When will we
ever be able to looK beyond the
dollar mark in our transactions,
especially in this business of
Character Building? The trus
tee who will choose his teacher
through sympathy alone for the
teacher's "bad luck" or simply
because she is his daughter, re
gardless of qualification, ought
to be sent to old Mexico to hunt
for Villa with nothing more than
a common shot-gun with which
to defend himself.
The above mentioned trustees
may live in Mexico, I don't know
I hope they do not live in Crit
tenden county. Of course, it is
hard to always be able to choose
the best teacher from among
those who apply, and our meth
ods of standardizing, or licens
ing teachers are not the best in
the world, but we might, at
least give it as much thought
and investigation as we do that
of buying a pig.
The teacher is the next factor
in this beloved institution of
ours-the Public Schools. Teach
ing is a consecrated calling-next
to that of preaching the gospel,
quite so if rightfully pursued.
This article would always remain
incomplete without that old ped
agogical statement "as is the
teacher, so will be the school"
We believe ninety-nine per cent
of this statement to be aa true as
gospel. The Public School sys
tem of the United States has
been termed a failure by foreign
critics, also, some of our own
educators: especially, has Ken
tucky been criticized severely
for her illiteracy, all on account
of system, inefficient teachers,
bad supervision, etc But I must
confine myself to Crittenden
county. Our greatest trouble is
profess! onal unpre parudnesa.
There are about three classes af
flicted with this malady. The
young teacher who is not old
enough and who has not
been taught to think; the old
teacher, cynical and does not try
to improve further; the busy
teacher who farms through the
summer and rides ten miles back
and forth to school in the falL
The two latter ought to go to
Mexico with their trustees. The
younger teacher is net so much to
blame for her unpreparedness as
her parent is. Usually her good
Impulse, inspiration, or vision if
you please, is the life of the
world. Laudable in any mortal,
but where Is there a profession
that will permit untrained hands
and minds to perform its work?
In time of war the government
will net permit her boys to go out
to shoot their neighbors without
first submitting them to a strict
mode of training. If the teacher
is going to leara her job by cold
blooded experiment practiced on
the childhood of the country the
money to be paid for teachers'
salaries should be kept in the
treasury until she learns the pro
fession.
Thank you. Dr. Stone. If mi
eyes ever need fixing I will give
ou the job, because I think you
now your proiession..
Yours very truly,

discussed many questions of vital
importance to the schools. They
fixed the time for all the county
schools to begin on Monday, July
31st 1916.
They discussed the propriety
of throwing the doors of the
school houses open to all kinds
of meetings without first requir
ing some responsible person or
persons to stand responsible for
all avoidable damages done to
property during said meetings.
The County Board, in a meet
ing after said mass meeting is
sued an edict that all trustees
should follow Section 139 of the
School Law in this matter, read
ing as follows:
"When a responsible person of
any subdistrict may apply to any
subdistrict trustee for the use of
house, to be used when school is
not in session, during the school
hours or vacations, by any law
ful assembly of educational, re
ligious, agricultural political
civic or social bodies, organiza
tions or gatherings, and if said
subdistrict trustee refuse the use
of same, then the -said trustee
shall state his cause for refusal
in writing,' and ' if a demand,
signed by five freeholders of said
subdistrict be presented to said
subdistrict trustee, then he shall
deliver or cause to be delivered
the keys of said school house, to
such freeholders who shall be
responsible for the use and care
of said school property and of
avoidable damages and the re
turn of the keys to the teacher
of said district, if school he in

HAS A BIG FIRE
Miss Maude Hughes, Formerly Of
This Place, Writes Us Letter
About the Confiscation.
Nashville, Tenn., Mar. 27, '16.
Mr. S. M. Jenkins,
Marion, Ky.
Dear Sir:
Marion friends doubtless heard
immediately of the fearful fire
that swept Nashville, last Wed
nesday, March 22nd, but if any
one was damaged by the fire
who has friends in Marion, I am
not aware of it though I cannot
speak with certainty.
The fire did not touch the cen
tral portion of the city, but was
across the river, in what waa
formerly Edgefield, the nearest
point of the burnt district being
about seven blocks from the
public square, which i3 one block
this side of the river.
The wind was blowing about
50 miles an hour. The fire start
ed about noon and a negro cabin
caught first and that set a plan
ing mill on fire and then ' the
sparks and burning shingles set
other buildings and a spotted
fire resulted, which our splendid
fire department could not cope
with. All the engines in the city
were on the ground but were
powerless to check the fire; man
sion and hovel went down before
it, and in many cases splendid
homes of brick and : stone- were
burned to the ground,' and small
frame houses next to them es
caped unharmed. Fire plays
many strange freaks, as well as
cyclones. The city wired tot.
heb to Clarksville. Chattanooga. "
Memnhia and TNjiavillp hut I in
not think any of the engines got
here, as the fire was subdued
about 5:00 P. M.
About 36 blocks and 300 real-'
dences were burned, and this in
a fine residential section. One
Presbyterian church and one
Christian church opposite each
other were burned. One large
Public school went down,

aged, called "The Little Sisters
of the Poor" also burned. These
last named were comparatively
new buildings and were beauti

only two sick people tn this home
for the aged, so there was no
trouble in getting them out of
the house. . It wss remarkable
