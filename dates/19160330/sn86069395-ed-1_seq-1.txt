will be considered at the next meet

FACTIONS LINING IIP.
Rufus H. Vansant, the Ashland cap
italist, will be a candidate before the
coming democratic state convention
for the position of chairman of the I
democratic state central and execu-;
live committees. Col. Vansant form-,
erly held this position in the party
organization, but was ousted at the
state convention last year, which was I
controlled by Governor Stanley. Col.
Vansant was aligned with United
States Senator Beckham's faction.
His entrance into the ring indicates
that the democrats will stage a battle
royal for control of the- convention,
with Senator Beckham and the Louis
ville organization aligned against Gov
ernor Stanley and Senator James.
Justhw the Haldeman-Woodson
conteet will, adjust itself to these
alignments remains to be seen.

CONTEMPT
New Move by Divorced Wile
of E. G. Peterson of
This City.
CITED TO ELKT0N COURT
Failing to Pay $40 a Month
in Alimony For the Past
Ten Months.
Elkton, Ky., March 29. Acting on
an affidavit filed in Circuit Court yes
terday by Mrs. Bernis M. Peterson,
of Otsego county, New York, Judge
John S. Rhea issued a rule against
and a warrant for the arrest of Eric
Gustavus Peterson, of Hopkinsville,
to appear before him next Monday
and show cause why he should not
be punished for contempt of court in
failing to pay Mrs. Peterson $40 a
month alimony for the past ten months.
Mrs. Peterson states in her affidav
it that she was nominally the plain
tiff in a divorce suit in the Logan Cir
cuit Court at its February term, 1914,
at which a judgment for divorce, ali
mony and the custody of their infant
daughter, Jane Peterson, was award
ed her; that Peterson was her hus
band and by fraud and collusion he
procured the divorce and has since
married Miss Louise Jones, of Hop
kinsville, who is said to be the wealth
iest person in Christian county, and
worth $300,000.
She further claims in her affidavit
that Peterson is now making an effort
to take advantage of the bankrupt
laws for the purpose of defeating her
in the collection of a claim for $8,000
due the estate of her dead mother
for borrowed money.
A $100,000 damage suit was filed
against Mrs. Louise Jones Peterson
in the Christian Circuit Court a
year ago for alleged alienation of her
husband's affections. The case was
settled out of court.

METHODISTS
WILL UNITE
Venerable Prelate Predicts
That All Christian Churches
Will Join.
Washington, March 29. A union
of the Methodist Episcopal church
and the Methodist Episcopal church,
south, before 1920 was predicted by
Bishop Earl Cranston, speaking to
members of the Baltimore conference
of the Methodist Episcopal church,
which opened its one hundred and
thirty-second session here tonight
with a reception to the veteran bishop,
who retires from active service in
May.
"Unless Methodism has lost its
sancness as well as its religion,"
Bishop Cranston said, "there is going
to be a union of the two churches be
fore 1920." He added that he looked
for a reorganization of all followers
of John Wesley in the United States
and ultimately for a union of all
Christian churches.
Rev. E. K. Hardin is a Washington
clergyman; speaking, he said, for two
million members of the Methodist
; church, south, declared that "the day
is not far distant when Bishop Cran
ston's dream of a union of the two
churches will be realized."

HEADED TO SOUTH PASSES
Question of Supplies for Ex
peditionary Force Over
shadows All Others.
El Paso, Tex., March 29. Dis
patches from the front interpreted in
connection with news brought by
Americans returning from different
points in the interior of Chihuahua
caused a belief here last night that
Francisco Villa was headed for San
Andres, about twenty-five miles south
west of Chihuahua City, a favorite
headquarters of the bandit. He is
thought to be already not less than
fifty miles ahead of his pursuers and
possibly leading the chase a much
greater distance.
If Villa is able to effect a junction
witli Reyes near Parral, the problem
of his extermination will have become
a serious one, as he then will be able
to control several thousand soldiers,
who, split into guerrilla bands, might
be able to keep up a desultory moun
tain warfare for an unlimited period,
they point out.
The supplies question overshadows
everything else now. Army officers
here say that upon its solution de
pends every chance of a successful
termination to the pursuit of the ban

A railroad accident south of Casas
Grandes caused the first death in the

wreck.
TWO MINORITY
LEADERS TIPPED
Brock and Oliver Favored
For The Tax Commis
sion. Frankfort, Ky., March 29. While
the selection of a commission to draft
a revenue and taxation bill to reform
the entire tax system of the State is
under consideration by Gov. Stanley,
and he has announced no appoint
ments, three members of the General
Assembly are believed to be certain
to bo on it. They are Representative
Reuben Hutchcraft, of Bourbon
county; Senator Hiram Brock, of
Harlan, and Representative J. A.
Oliver, of Allen county.
Representative Hutchcraft has
m iinvti uiui v .iiiivi; nuuicai lit
tlx question during the last two ses
sions than any other member of the
General Assembly. He is author of
the graduated inheritance tax law
and fathered two (progressive meas

them would have given the State
Board of Equalization authority to in
crease county assessments and send

them back to the local "boards for

Senator Brock was minority leader
in the Senate and Representative Oli-

Their selection will give the Repub -
licans strong representation on the
commission.
