The wreck was tho worst that has

ono of tho worst In tho history of tho

second trip on tho Now York-Chicago

beforo signalmen could Hag it, the
fast Twentieth Century Limited, west
bound, pride of tho New York Central,
crashed Into tho wreckngo which had
piled up on tho westbound track.
Daylight had not yet appeared when
the three trains piled up together.
Fnrmcrs and villagers rjished to the
assistance of the stricken passengers.
Tho work of rescuing thoso pinioned
tinder tho wreckngo was hampered by
the darkness, which wns accentuated
by tho fog.
Ambulances, automobiles nnd all
kinds of vehicles were rushed from

of the wreck. Tho little morgue at
Amherst was soon filled with bodies of
tlio dead. Most of tho Injured wore
conveyed to hospitals In Klyrln.
Tho Twentieth Century proceeded
on Its way to Chicago. None of the
passengers on this train was Injured.
All of tho dead and Injured were on

A state hotel inspector was in this

is nothing remarkable about that
statement, for ho Is supposed to be
hero occasionally. He walked Into ono
of our restaurants as far as tho pro

him if ho did not wish to look around.
Tho aforesaid hotel Inspector said it
was not worth whilo. He pocketed his
feo and walked out. Wo might writo
a column, but what's tho use.

And this means that n number of

here, and It Is Tho Ledger's predic
tion that tho forecaster's figures will
bo short by about two feet.
Judging from the volumo of water
passing this city In tho Ohio river at
present, some places besides this city
had n big rainfall the forepart of this
week.
Thursday morning, with a rlso of
over two feet during tlio night, tho
ivntcr had closed traffic around Lime
Rtouc nnd Front streets, Wall and
Front nnd compelled tho Street Hall
way Company to "ball out" at Bridge
street In order to keep from trans
ferring at that point.
Any rlso'un this wnter Is n big one,
but when It maintains a steady push
up the banks of two Inches per hour
for ten hours thoro Is somo wnter do
ing tho pushing.
By night, nt the present rate of rise,
tho water will be over Bridge street
under the C. & O., and will bo In that
company's yards at tho foot of Lime
stone street.
Tho river was full of drift Thursday
morning and (ho rise now passing is
out of the Muskingum and Kanawha
rivers.
Men wore busy Wednesday moving
things nt the dnm to higher ground
ami preparing the timber piles to
