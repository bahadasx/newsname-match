tion harrow is used as suggested.
12. Cultivator: Some one
of the many three-tooth cultiva
tors may be used to good advan
tage for the first cultivation.
These implements run fairly
deep, sufficiently so to break the
soil as deep as it should be
broken at this time of the year.
Later cultivations should be
shallow and may be done with
any of the cultivators having
spring-tooth attachments, or a
scooter stock with a small shovel,
in connection with a wide heel
sweep may be used to a good
advantage. ' This latter imple
ment is the cheapest to be had,
easy to run, and does excellent
work.
13. Cultivators Two
Horse: There are many practi
cal two-horse cultivators on the
market and they do excellent
work and are great time savers.
The same plan as followed with
the one-horse cultivators should
be followed with the two-horse.
The first cultivation may be
deep, but later ones should be
shallow.
14. Laying By: Plant peas
at the rate of one and a half to
two bushels to the acre when the
corn is bunching for tassel.
15. Our Aim: One hundred
million bushels in 1916.

Mrs. Frank Herndon
at Cards
Entertains
One of the prettiest and most
enjoyable social affairs of the
season was on Friday, March
24th, when Mrs. Frank M. Hern
don entertained, irom 6 to o in
the afternoon and from 8 to 11
in the evening, at cards, v
Mrs. Herndon, in her usual
charming manner, met the
guests and ushered them into the
reception rooms, which were
beautiful in their decorations of
ferns and cut flowers. Vases
filled with pink carnations added
beauty and fragrance to the
scene.
During the progress of the
games the strains of sweet music
was heard from the Victrola in
an adjoining room, played by
Miss Louise Nix.
A two course menu was
served, carrying out a pretty
color motif of pink and white in
the ices. Pink carnations were
given as favors. -
COMFORTING WORDS

To have the pains and aches of a
bad back removed to be entirely
free from annoying, dangerous uri
nary disorders, is enough to make any
kidney sufferer grateful. The follow
ing advice of one who has suffered
will prove comforting words to hun
dreds of Okolona readers.
Mrs. J. C. Droke, Silver St., Oko
lona, says: "I had been feeling tired,
run down and all out of sorts for
some time. I had no strength or ener
gy and by spells It just seemed as
if I would collapse. My back was
weak and always distressed me more
when I was on my feet. Doan's Kid

aches and pains left, my kidneys were

R. S. Wilson, state agent of the
farm demonstration . work in
Mississippi and connected with
the United. States Department of
Agriculture, is issuing the fol
lowing signed statement tonight
in regard to the efforts to abolish
the branch experiment stations
at Holly, Springs, Stoneville and
McNeil:
We feel sure tnat every
citizen of Mississippi that be
lieves in real progress and educa
tion will be grieved to, learn
that the appropriations for our
three branch experiment stations
have met with executive veto.
"While personally this does
not affect me at all, but as ex
ecutive head of the farmers'
co-operative demonstration work
I can but view this action of the
executive with keen disappont
ment. One of the main func
tions of our work is to carry
direct ,to the people on the farm
the information worked out by
tne stations m tne several sec
tions of the state; They have
been of inestimable assistance to
us, as they are the main source
to which the extension depart
ment can look for accurrte data
in the state.
"The contention that the
county agricultural high schools
are taking the place of the
stations can be based upon
nothing but a lack of real
knowledge of the work of the
two institutions. Being well ac
quainted with the authors of the
agricultural high school law, I
know that such a thing was
never contemplated. The agri
cultural high school is designed
to teach the youth of the several
counties the correct theory of
agriculture and home economics
and to demonstrate its applica
tion. They are not " designed,
neither are they equipped, for
investigational work. The adult
population must look to the ex
perimental and extension de
partments for accurate data for
their guidance. The criticism
that the stations are failures be
cause they do not make money
is also based on mistaken notion
as to their object. Were the
station forces on a money-mak
ing basis they would cease to be
experiment stations and could
only be demonstration farms.
They would only carry on such
work as they knew would be a
financial success and could not
undertake real experimental
work. Their real job is to con
duct experiments that the indi
vidual cannot undertake for the
sake of information.
The Legislature has recently,
with the hearty approval of the
governor, passed a bill carrying
an appropriation of more than
twice that rexuired by the
stations for the Mississippi Cen
tennial. This, if I understand
it, is for the purpose of advertis
ing the resources and opportuni
ties afforded by our beloved
state. When the. news is car
ried, as it will be, to all parts of
the country, that Mississippi has
decided to cut out her experi
ment stations, cripple the educa
tional institutions and turn back
ward in her march to progress,
it will be an advertisement of a
very effective nature, but in the
wrong direction, hvery one
who comes in contact with peo
ple from the most progressive
sections, such as we desire for
settlers, is famaliar with their
reluctance to cast their lot in a
state that is not progressive."
