Despite Efforts, Torpedo

Ambassador Page Reports
British Ship Made Target
While at Work.
Paris, March 80.—In the official
report of the captain of the cross
channel steamship Sussex on the cir
cumstances under which she was
damaged by an explosion in crossing
the channel last Friday with the loss
of 66. the following passage occurs:
"I perceived about 2:60 o'clock, the
wake of a torpedo 160 yards to port.
I immediately ordered the helm thirty
degrees to the right and in order to
accelerate the maneuver ordered the
stoppage of the starboard engine,
which was Immediately done. All my
efforts notwithstanding, I cpuld not
avoid the projecti.le, which hit the
bow of the Sussex on a line with the
foremast and produced a formidable
explosion, carrying away all of the
front of the vessel up to the first air
tight bulkhead."
Washington, March 30.—For the
information of ttie state department,
American Ambassador Page at Lon
don forwarded a report by cable that
the British destroyer which aided in
rescuing the survivors at- the Sussex
had been fired upon twice by a sub
marine. Ambassador Page aald that
his information is not official, but ap
peared to be.authentic, and sent the
report for what It. was worth to the
department.
State department officials consider
that Page's Information tended to
substantiate press reports ot an al
leged attack upon the destroyer.

HERMES
OF BRIGAND

Another Report of Villa
Raid, But it is Not
Confirmed.
BELIEVES HE GOT
THROUGH CORDON
Railroads to be Offered Sup
plies, but Truck Train
Will be Kept Up.
PITRC'HASICS AEROPLANES.
Washington, Marcli 30.—The im
mediate purchnsu. of eight aero
planes to be sent at once to General
Pershing was authorized by the war
department. A special board of
signal corps officers has been or
dered here to inspect and test the
machines before shipment.
El Paso, Tex., March 30.—Briga
dier-General Pershing has projected
in the long and relentless campaign in
the hunt for Villa a chase that may
last for many weeks before the flee
ing bandit is run to death. This in
formation was gleaned here from
military men who made no secret of
their belief that Villa has slipped
through the cordon of- Carranza
forces and American troops.
Whereabouts Unknown.
Mexican officials said they had no
news as to Villa's whereabouts, but
that the troopB of the de facto gov
ernment are aiding the American sol
diers in trying to round up the bri
gand. The last information was that
Villa was moving through the Santa.
Maria valley. Once among his peon
friends, who would give American
troops misleading information regard
ing his whereabouts, Villa might es
cape detection for a long time.
Danger of Betrayal.
Ranchers from the region west of
Chihuahua City said that if- it became
known that- .there wap a. price out ,Vil
la's Head, dead or alive, the pajfdit
would be In constant danger of be
trayal. It Is assumed that this word
of a big reward has been spread
among the peons.
Roving Bands of Rebels....
Roving bands of Villa men are re
ported everywhere in the region of
Canta Maria valley, but apparently
the American flying columns have not
come in contact with them.
One report that Villa on Tuesday
had raided Santa Tomas, south of
Namiquipa, became current here, but
was not confirmed. Neither General
Gavivra, commander of the Juarez
garrison, nor Mexican Consul Garcia
nad received any advices from Mex
ico, and officers of the Mexico-North
western railroad said they had no in
formation regarding the reported
raid, which is not credited.
To Keep Up Truck Train.
Ban Antonio, Tex., March 30.—Al
though military supplies will be of
fered the management of the Mexico
Northwestern railroad at Juarez for
shipment to American troops in Mex
ico, officers at army headquarters
here regard the conditional use of the
railroad as so experimental that the
motor truck line from Columbus will
be maintained.
Feeling More Optimistic.
Douglas, Ariz., March 30.—A mere,
optimistic feeling than has been -ex
hibited since the American punitive
expedition crossed the Chihuahua
border with orders to kill or capture
Villa was apparent on both sides of
the border yesterday, following re
ceipt of the news that Carranza, the
de facto president of Mexico had giv
en permission for the passage of food
supplies for the United States expedi
tion.
The undercurrent of alarm which
has been evident among Americans
and Mexicans alike, over the possible
outcome of the railroad situation, ap
parently had been dissipated.

OFFICIALS SAY HE

Denies, However, That He
was Incapacitated—Says
Signal Did Not Work.
Cleveland, March 30.—With JT
bodies recovered from yesterday's
wreck of the three New York Central
railroad's fast trains, at Amherst,
'.•nio, attention is focused today on tn«
several investigations that were put
under way by federal, state and rail
road authorities to determine respon
sibility for the wreck.
Baby Crib Behind It.
If Towerman A. R. Ernst of Am
herst, is held culpable in the Investi
gation. blame will trace back to a tiny
baby crib in the Ernst home at Elyrla.
The baby was born Sunday night.
.Since that time Ernst has had little
sleep, railroad officials say.
Two men at whom moat of the
questions are to be directed were En
gineer Herman Hess of the second
section of the Buffalo-Chicago Flyer
and Towerman Ernst.
Ernst stoutly denied that he wae
asleep or that he was incapacitated by
the loss of sleep. He asserted that he
set the signal properly, but that it
failed to work and that the accident
was caused thereby.
"While my wife was ill," said Ernst,
"1 got my regular sleep and went
about my duties as usual. The signal
simply failed to work. That is'all. If
the signals had worked properly, the
block signal light two. miles away
would have flashed a c&utiim &nd,(^«
block a mile away would ~h4Lve
signaled Hess to come to «. dead Stop.
Hess was too good an engineer to rttn
past two signals set against him. I
was on the lookout for train No. 86
I first section Buffalo Flyer.) When
it was two miles away, 'T threw the
signal lever into the clear, giving 86
a clear path. I realized there had
been a signal failure when the train
stopped. When the train had stopped,
I again Jammed the signal lever into
the clear and this time It might hav»
worked, for the train started ahead.
Then the crash came. I didn't have
time to stop the Twentieth Century
before it, too, crashed Into the wreck.
Tell of Wreck.
Chicago. March 30.—Passengers on
the Twentieth Century Limited who
escaped Injun* despite the fact. that,
the train of eight coaches ploughed
through the wreckage of two sections
of an fast bound train at high speed
told of the catastrophe on arrival in
Chicago last night.
There was no panic on the limited.
fh« passengers said. The electric
lights continued to glow and the oc
cupants of the sleeping cars were en
abled, after they were jostled awake
in their berths, to arrange temporary
relief for the persons injured in the
collision.
Mrs. Robert S. Hotz, wife of a.
wealthy Chicagoan, who «ad recently
taken a course in war nursing at a
hospital, directed the first aid work
with
a coolness that won the admira-
of

purpose of stanching the flow
from the wounds of the victims.
B. E. Sunny, president of the Chi
cago Telephone company, was in the
middle of the first sleeping car be
hind the locomotive of the limited.
De was awakened by the crash at
3:18 a- m. He said the women were
calm as well as the men.
"Everybody dressed hurriedly,"' Mr.
Sunny said, "and ran to see what
was the matter. The locomotive of
our train lay on its side. Two bag
gape cars also had toppled over. The
buffet car and the sleeping car in
which I rode had left the tra-ck and
lister1 to a dangerous angle. All
around were piles of wreckage from
which wounded and dead were taken
as fast as possible."
Die in Woman's Arms.
Dolores Rose and Hebe Vassellier,
bound for Chicago to take part in
Lady Duff Gordon's fashion fete for
the benefit, of war orphans of the
allies, assisted in the rescue work.
Two peitsons expired almost in the
arms of Miss Vassellier. The women
have not learned whether the valua
ble gowns they were bringing to Chi
