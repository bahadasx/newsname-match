OLD TIMER
PASSES AWAY
Oliver J. Stirk, a former resident of
this city, bat for the past two years
living at White Bear, Minn., recently
passed away. He has a host of
friends here who will be sorry to learn
of his death. At one time he was con
nected with the police foree of this
city, and was the father of Mrs. Chas.
E. Taylor, now of Fargo. The White
Bear Press has this to say regarding
his death arid funeral:
"Taps" were sounded in the home
of another Civil War veteran last
•Wednesday morning, at 5:30 and Oli
ver J. Stirk answered the "roll call"
on the mighty camp ground of the
Great Beyond. The sudden de.riEe of
Mr. Stirk came a a shock to his many
friends and neighbors as well as to the
family, as it followed an illness of
pneumonia of but three days.d" ration.
The deceased gentleman was born
in Neshanimy, Bucks Co., Pi'.., Sept.
27, 1840. Tn 1883, Mr.Stirk moved
west settling in Devils Lake, N. D.,
where he lived until 1912, when he
moved to Willow City, N. D. After
two years* residence at that place he
and Mrs. Stirk came to White Bear
located at White Bear Beach which
has since been his home.
During the Civil War he en'isted in
Co. A., 104t"n Pa. regiment, and s-"ved
with that regiment during the war.
In the years since that time he has
taken an active interest in the work of
the G.A. K. Hewas Past Commander
of the G. A. R., Post at
Dcvilg
I,alee,
and was honored with being elected
to that position in E. B. Gibbs Post
No. 76, G. A. R., of our village which
position he held at the time of his de
mise.
The funeral will be held from the
home next Sunday at 1 o'clock, ser
vices in charge of Rev. Biller, and it is
hoped the members of the 2v A.-R.,
Post will attend in a body in which
case the G. A. R. service will be con
ducted at the house.
The deceased is survived by the wid
ow and one daughter Mrs. Chas. E.
Taylor, of Fargo, N. Mrs. Taylor
was notified of the serious il'.ness of
her father in time to reach his bed
side and be able to assist caring for
him during his last hours.
Harold Judson, grandson of Mrs.
Stirk, who is attending the millitary
academy at Owatonna, is home and,
because of Mr. Stirk's interest in mil
itary affairs and at the request of
those having charge of the funeral, he
has consented to wear his military
uniform and blow the "Taps" at the
conclusoin of the G. A. R. service.
Others expected from out of town
are Charles E. Taylor, of Fargo, and
T. W. Henry of Buffalo.
A CLOSE COR-
A. C. Townley and A. E. Bowen are
the two men most responsible for the
existance of the Non-partisan League,
Townley is the brains, push and pep
per Bowen is the noise. Townley is
a skilled promoter, shrewd and un
scrupulous, desceptive and dishonest.
A politician himself, he leads a move
ment warning others to beware of pol
iticians. He calls others crooks, while
he owns around one hundred and fifty
thousand dollars in the shape of un
satisfied judgments and chattel mort
gages. He is against political fakirs,
and engaged himself in faking thru
a scheme intended to make him politi
cal boss of the state. He brands news
papers as unreliable and lies as to a
circulation of forty thousand. He is
for free speech, and suggests boycot
ting newspapers which speak against
the League. He says farmers have
always been fooled by politicians and
expects farmers to trust him. He
wants to be their terminal and do their
thinking. He wants a packing plant,
and all pocked in one party. He wants
a recall law, and he wants to do the
recalling himself. He wants single
tax on farm lands and he wants to
tax farmers nine dollars to tell them
How to vote. He wants rural credit
-but he does not want to pay what he
owes. He wants to mix No. 1 hard
Republicans with No. 4 soft Socialist
to r-ise the grade. A failure himself,
he wants to show the farmer how to
succeed.

A. E. Bowen, thru the courtesy of
the Commercial Club of Bismarck,
ide his last speech in their hall in
Feb. 1915, wherein he advocated class
organization against class, the farmer
against the business man. For the
past eight years he has been a So
cialist organizer, speaker and office
seeker. If he has a dollar today, he
did not get it by hard wark. He got
it out of socialist collections or League
donations.
D. D. Coates is an imported politi
cian, an editor of a now defunct so
cialist paper. He is not a citizen of
this state or property owner. The
evils he complains of, he has never
suffered from. He was imported be
cause of his class hatred and known

ity to stir up class against class.
Mr. Thompson was called to his
present work as one of the editors of
the Leader from Minot, where he held
down the editorial chair in the Icono

party in this state. He has for many
years been an editor and agitator in
the Socialist movement. He is a
shrewd, clever writer and versed on
promoting class hatred.
None of the above men have suc

COMMERCIAL
Monday evening there, was an im
portant meeting of the Commercial
Club, and after the business meeting
was over there was a lunch and smok
er. After the meeting was called to
order by Vice President Howard Mah
er, President Hyland being abs snt, M.
R. Hovde gave a short report on the
work of the committee appointed 'o
aid in the work of cleaning up and
beautifying our city. The next mat
ter to come up was the matte of
the building of a high school building
and its location. This brought out
considerable oratory on the rart of
some of the members. The ball 'vas
started rolling by M. R. Hovde, who,
in a well written and well delivered
address, opposed the locating of the
new building at the north and in the
rear of the present Central school
building. He offered many objections,
and after he was through F. P. Mann
gave a nice talk relative to the matter
and pointed out some of the possible
defects and also some of the benefits
wliich would arise from the proposed
location. Siver Serumgard was there
and as he is a member of the school
board he was called upon for some re
marks, and as is usual with Siver's
speeches, considerable sarcasm .»
immediately forthcoming. After he
got through Col. J. M. Kelley spoke at
length of* the future of our city and
the many possibilities before us and
advised that if a High school building
was erected that it should be in a good
location with plenty of ground for a
playground. Before the meeting
wound up a motion was passed ap
pointing a committee of three to join
with the school board in an attempt
to find a proper site for the new bir'ld
ing. The local band.was pesent and
furnished several fine select-ens under
the direction of Dr. Ecklund.
The case of Johnson vs. Sam Wine
man has been decided in Supreme
court in favor of Winenan. This was
a case wherein Johnson filed a iien on
the Wineman block in this rity, for
wages. Mr. Wineman claimed the
charges were too much and the case
was tried in District court here, Wine
man winning out. The case was ap
pealed to the higher court and Wine
man gets the decision.
WORLD—VOLUME VI. NUMBER 13 DEVILS LAKE, NORTH DAKOTA, THURSDAY, MARCH 30, 1916
One big and significant fact has
thus far been developed by the Yuca
tan sisal monopoly investigation now
in progress at Washington before a
sub-committee of the United States
Senate Committee on Agriculture and
Forrestry.
This fact is that the sisal monopoly
which has been in full control for only
about six months, has already im
posed a tax of from $3,000,000 to $5,
000,000 a year on the American farm
er and has the power further to in
crease that tax.
Organizers, officers and beneficiaries
of the combination have admitted that
they have an absolute monopoly. They
claim exemption from the Sherman
Anti-Trust Law because the combina
tion to control the sisal market was
formed in Yucatan and not in the
United States.
The sisial monojoly is supported by
backed by the Carranza government of
Mexico. Thru the Commission Regula
dora del Mercado de Henequen, of Reg_
the military governor of Yucatan,
ulating Committee, it absolutely con
trols the sisal production of that Mex
ican state. It is financed by a small
group of American bankers and their
associates who have agreed to lend the
Regulating Committee up to $10,
000,000 at one time—enough to carry
and withhold from the market an en
tire season's sisal crop. Besides cur
rent interest on all such loans, with
ample security, these few financiers
are getting a commission, as indicated
by the testimony, of not less than
$400,000 a year, and possibly $1,000,
000 a year on a capital investment of
$1,000,000.
Sisal fiber constitutes eighty-five per
cent of America's raw material for
binder twine, and the monopoly now
fixes the price as it pleases. It has
already advanced it from an average
of 5 1-2 to 7 3-8 cents a pound f. o. b.
New York. Some twine makers have
been informed of the sisal monopoly's
agents that the price will be 9 cents a
pound by July. It has been publicly
declared by an officer of the regulat
ing Committee that it can raise the
price to ten cents a pound if it choose.
Directly and solely as a result of the
increases in the price of sisal made by
the monopoly, American manufack
ers have been or will be compelled to
make corresponding advances in the
price of binder twine. The Kansas
penitentiary has announced its twine
price for 1916 at 9 1-2 cents a pou
as against 6 3-4 cents last year—an
increase jf 2 1-2 cents a pound. Upon
this basis the farmers of Kansas alone
will pay nearly half a million dollars
more for their twine this year than
they did in 1915.

THE YUCATAN SISAL MONOPOLY
VS. THE AMERICAN FARMER
AND INTER-OCEAN
The promoters of the monopoly de
clare that their one purpose is to
benefit the "poor planters" of Yuca
tan. Their own testimony shows that
while the poens, or day laborers, may
have been receiving small wages,
many of the Yucatan planters are very
wealthy. The entire sisal crop of Yu
catan is raised by about 200 planter -.
Its annual value is approximately $20,
000,000.
The monopoly's attack on the Inter
national Harvester Company are made
merely to divert attention from the
actual facts and to deceive the Amer
ican farmer and the public generally.
It was charged at the hearing that
the Company had financed a revolu
tion in Yucatan. Mr. Cyrus H. Mc
jCormick, President of the Harvester
.Company destroyed that falsehood
with an explicit public denial.
It was 'charged that the Harvester
Company had attempted to intimidate
certain banks from participating in
this monopoly, and that it had closed
its account with one such bank. The
officials of this bank themselves deny
the charge.
It was charged that an official of
the Harvester Company had left the
country to avoid testifying. This
falsehood was promptly disposed of by
the statement of the Chairman of the
investigating committee that the wit
ness referrec' to had left the qountry
on business, with the Chairan's
knowledge and consent. He has since
returned and is ready to testify when
called.
When the hearing- is resumed, fur
ther evidence will be presented refut
ing these and other like charges and
insinuations. Officials of the Har
vester
Cr'r.
no..e of whom has
yet been heard, will then have a
chance to testify, and it is probable
that representatives of other twine
manufacturers, as well as of farmers'
organizations, will tell of the effects of
the sisal monopoly.
The issue before the Investigating
Committee has been rather adroitly
confused by false and sensational
charges, so as to keep the American
farmer from finding out that the real
controversy is between himself ar.d
the Yucatan monopoly. Whatever
amount the monopoly adds to the price
of sisal, the twine manufacturers must
add to the price of binder twine—all
the increase necessarily comes out of
the farmer. No matter what the
Committee may recommend, or what
Congress may do, the manufacturers
cannot make twine without a reasona
ble profit. Sisal is the chief item of
cost, and the price of binder twine is
fixed by the cost of the fiber.
Therefore, 't is the farmers, and not
CORNERING A PORCUPINE MAY BE EASY. BUT GRASPING HIM IS DIFFERENT.
12,000 BIBLES

Fargo, N. D., March 27.—As a cli
max to their work of placing a bible
in guest rooms in hotels in North Da
kota, the North Dakota Gideons, at

STAY DENIED
ACT CASE
Bismarck, March 27.—Chief Justice
Fisk today denied a stay asked by
Attorney Aubery Lawrence of Fargo,
for the bonding companies seeking to
set aside the bonding act passed by
the last legislature. The federal dis
trict court will now be asked to order
the state to refrain from putting the
state bonding- department in operation
until the United States Supreme court
has passed upon the constitutionality
of the act creating it.
Legislature Passed Law.
The last legislature passed a law
creating a state bonding department,
to be under the supervision of insur
ance commissioner. Certain bonding
companies doing business in the state
started action in court in an attempt
to have the law declared unconstitu
tional, lost in the state courts and
have appealed to the United States
supreme court. It will take about two
years before that tribunal can pass
upon the case.
Lack Enough Funds.
In the meantime the law will be in
operation in North Dakota, and Com
missioner Taylor has decided to put it
into effect at once. The legislature
failed to appropriate enough funds to
star it out with but after & consul
tation with State Treasurer Steen, the
commissioner announced that the
treasurer will honor warrants for nec
essary supplies up to $1,500, enabling
the new department to begin business
right away. All township, village and
city officers can now be bonded by the
state upon application.

OCEAN—VOLUME XXXIII. NUMBER 43
SWEET CLOVER
A GOOD CROP
If you need something on your farm
to help keep up the fertility, furnish
very good hay and pasture, that
will grow where and when nothing
else does, early in the spring, late wi
the fall, on alkali, wet, dry, stony or
gumbo spots try Sweet Clover.
Sweet Clover has long been known
as an outcast among plants, growing
by the roadside and in waste places,
often being cursed, except by the bee
keepers, but it never has really both
ered in the fields except occasionally
in the medows. It seeras now ibat,
like many other things that we at first
rejected, it is finding its place among
the valuable crops on many farms.
It may be that you have a place for it
on your farm. Read what it is doing
for others in the Northwest., and at
least be neutral until you have tried it.
Sweet clover seed may now be se
cured from nearly every seed house,
but care should be taken to specify
the kind you want, and to ask the deal
er if he knows what he is selling.
In general sweet clover may be seed
ed the same as red clover or alfalfa.
On the I. Ht C. Farms, we seed early
in the spring with small grain and
have had excellent success, 'icing eith
er oats, wheat or barley. We prefer
Marquis wheat, and seed only about
three-fourths of the ordinary seeding.
Marquis is early and dons not shade
the ground as much as some of the
other varieties.
In sections of less rainfall or short
er seasons than eastern North Dakota,
the sweet clover doubting should be
seeded alone as early as possible in
the spring. Sweet clover, like alfal
fa, must have a firm seed bed. Corn
or potato land, disked in the fall, and
harrowed lightly as soon as possible in
the spring, the seed sown broadcast
or drilled in shallow would be the best
preparation possible to make. Spring
or late fall plowing is too loose, and
usually results in a loss of seed.
Sweet clover seed is often very
hard, the seed coats being so thick
and imprevious that the seed is very
slow to absorb moisture and germin
ate. Sweet Clover naturally reseeds
itself in the fall. The seed is sub
jected to freezing and thawing during
fall and spring, whicli results in the
seed germir.ating as soon as warm
whether comes in the spring. We have
seeded our sweet clover as early as
possible. Freezing after it is up ap
parently does no harm.
We have uesd the clean hulled seed
in tl.e grass seeder, allowing the sweet
clover seed to be sown bro-c! j.st in
front of the discs. We have also
drilled it in with the grain, and have
always had good success. We have
always sown on good solid land, not
recently plowed, and have seeded ear
ly.—J. G. Haney, I. H. C. Farms,
