The annual spring term of the dis
trict court for Mille Lacs county open
ed Tuesday morning at 9 o'clock,
when Sheriff Harry Shockley called it
to order. Judge W. L. Parsons of
Fergus Falls arrived on Monday even
ing's train, and is presiding. This is
Judge Parson's third visit to Prince
ton in an official capacity, consequent
ly he is no stranger here. Philip M.
Woodward of St. Cloud is again with
us as court reporter.
The preliminary call of the calen
dar was the first order of business. On
the civil calendar for this term there
were 41 cases, 32 of which were ac
tions for a reduction of taxes on real
estate near Mille Lacs lake, and these
were disposed of Tuesday morning.
The facts were presented to the court,
and judgment was entered for a re
duction.
A motion for continuance in the di
vorce case of Rosa A. Bringleson vs.
Charles Bringleson was heard by the
court, and taken under advisement.
In the case of the Village of Mil
aca vs. A. C. Wilkes there was no ap
pearance on the part of the defend
ant, and on motion of plaintiff's at
torney judgment was ordered entered
for plaintiff.
Numerous of the grand and petit
jurors arrived on the morning train,
and Clerk of Court King called the
roll of the grand jury at 11 o'clock.
All members were present except F.
A. Maynard of Mudgett, who is out
of the county. The grand jury was
sworn, and Judge Parsons then de
livered his instructions to that body,
reading a portion of the statutes de-,
fining the duties, powers and respon
sibilities of grand jurors. August F.
Meyers of Princeton was appointed
foreman, and the labors were entered
upon at once.
The roll of the petit jury was then
called by the clerk, and all members
answered "present." The petit jury
was excused until 3 o'clock in the af
ternon.
In the case of J. A. Allen, as assig
nee, vs. Harry Shockley, a motion to
dismiss and for judgment on the
pleading, was heard by the court and
taken under advisement.
At noon the grand jury returned
two indictments against Leslie E.
Brown, charging forgery in the sec
ond degree, and the court then ad
journed until 2 o'clock in the after
noon.
When court reconvened four appli-
cations for citizenship papers were
acted upon. The following appeared
in open court, answered the questions
put to them in a satisfactory manner,
and after they had renounced all alleg
iance to foreign potentates, princes,
sovereigns and powers were made citi
zens: Petrus Anderson, Hayland
John William Swanson, Milaca, and
John Cornelius Van der Hulst, Ona
mia. The application of Adolph Lin
stedt of Page was continued over the
term, as one of his witnesses did not
prove satisfactory.
The first jury case came on for trial
Tuesday afternoon, being that of Ray
Davis vs. Jacob VanRhee. This was
a suit for $320 and interest, claimed
by the plaintiff to be due him as com
mission on land sold under the terms
of a verbal agreement between the
two parties. Mr. Davis claimed to
have brought three prospective land
purchasers to Mr. VanRhee, and that
these prospects purchased 320 acres
of land that under the terms of the
agreement he was entitled to $1 for
each acre. Attorney E. L. McMillan
appeared for the plaintiff, and attor
neys O. C. Myron and Godfrey G.
Goodwin for the defendant. The tes
timony of some of the witnesses was
rather conflicting, but after due delib
eration the jury brought in a ver
dict for Mr. Davis for the amount
claimed in the complaint.
Leslie E. Brown, indicted on two
counts for second degree forgery, was
arraigned Tuesday evening,- and the
court appointed S. P. Skahen to act
as attorney for the accused. Brown
signified his willingness to plead
guilty to one of the charges, after
consulting his attorney, and the plea
was accepted. Sentence was pro
nounced last evening, and an inde
terminate term at Stillwater will be
served by Brown. The prisoner is a
resident of Tuttle, N. D., and is al
most 29 years old. He has a wife
and two children. He was employed
at Foreston last summer, and the
crime to which he entered a plea of
guilty was committed at Milaca or
July 5 last, when he passed a forged
check for $31.75. Brown will prob
ably be taken to Stillwater tomorrow
by Sheriff Shockley, to commence
serving sentence.
The grand jury completed its labors
yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock, and
was dismissed. Indictments were re
turned against Reinhold Swedberg
and Hans Petrin of Onamia, charging
petit larceny. The accused men were
arraigned at noon today, and entered
pleas of "not guilty." Bail was fixed
in the sum of $200 in each case, but
no time for trial has as yet been set.
At the time of going to press the
case of Catherine A. King vs. J. C.
Herdliska was in progress of trial.
This is a suit to recover damages for
injuries alleged to have been sus
tained last fall when the defendant's
automobile collided wth the plaintiff.

Baldwin Social Affair.
The Angstman home in Baldwin
was the scene of a pleasing social
affair Saturday afternoon, when
Misses Ida May Schmidt and Alma
Johnson entertained at a parcel show
er in honor of Miss Mildred Johnson,
married to Mr. Ernest Rossing yes
terday.
The residence was appropriately
decorated for the occasion, the color
scheme being pink and white. Hearts
and cupids darts where everywhere
in evidence.
Music and games were the enter
tainment features. Misses Schmidt
and Esther Angstman rendered sev
eral piano duets and solos, and Miss
Schmidt also sang three selections
in her usual delightful manner. Reci
tations by Miss Estella Schumacher
were another enjoyable feature.
The bride-to-be received numerous
handsome articles of particular value
to a housewife, but was compelled to
locate them in the various out of the
way nooks and corners where they
were hidden before she obtained pos
session. A card contained the neces
sary information to enable her to find
the first gift, and then another card
directed her to second hiding place,
and so on.
Honors were awarded in the games
played, and Misses Mildred and Ag
nes Johnson were awarded first
prizes, while consolation prizes went
to Misses Clara Wicks and Anna
Hannay.
At five o'clock a dainty lunch was
served, after which all departed for
their respective homes, wishing Miss
Johnson unbounded joy in the years
to come, and declaring the hostesses
to be royal entertainers.
Fatal Accident.
A distressing accident that resulted
in the death of Lois, the seven-year
old daughter, of Mr. and Mrs. Amos
Howard of Minneapolis, occurred last
Friday afternoon at a school play
ground in that city. Lois and three
other small girls were teetering on a
balanced plank, provided for that pur
pose in the playground, when the girl
occupying the same end of the plank
as Lois jumped off to pick up her
handkerchief. The balance was de
stroyed, and the weight of the two
girls brought their end down with
considerable force. Lois was precipi
tated against an iron brace in the cen
ter of the teeter outfit, crushing her
skull and rendering her unconscious.
Death followed the next day.
The father of the unfortunate little

Abstract of the Tax Lists.
The abstract of the tax lists of the
counties of the state, which has just
been issued by State Auditor Preus,
is decidedly interesting.
The total real and personal valua
tion of the state is $1,491,964,548, an
increase of $15,964,940 over that of
a year ago.
"Money and credits" are returned
at $213,078,632, an increase of $15,-
452,718 over the 1914 figures. This
class af property is taxed at the
rate of three mills on the dollar. The
idea is that the people who have money
or credits will not object to a small
tax and will make proper returns,
whereas if money and credits were
taxed the same as other property very
little would be returned for taxation.
As it is $639,249 is levied against this
class of property and it is apportioned
as follows: One-sixth to the revenue
fund of the state, one-sixth to the
county revenue fund, one-third to the
city, village or town, and one-third to
the school district in which" the prop
erty is assessed.
The average rate of taxation
throughout the state by counties is
34.89 mills. Beltrami has the highest
rate of taxation, 80.57 mills, while
Sibley has the lowest) 19.82 mills.
Average rate in Mille Lacs, 49.47
mills in Isanti, 36.60 mills in Benton,
34.01 mills in Sherburne, 34.29 mills.
The average rate in Mille Lacs
county is higher than in the neighbor
ing counties because the towns in the
north end of the county are practically
undeveloped, and the excessively high
rates in the villages of Milaca and
Princeton increase the average-of the
county.
The real and personal valuation of
Mille Lacs county is $4,239,780 Isanti,
$4,022,455 Sherburne, $3,890,895
Benton, $4,712,974.
Money and credits are assessed in
Mille Lacs and neighboring counties
as follows: Mille Lacs, $245,550 Ben
ton, $503,551 Isanti, $273,366 Sher
burne, $289,642.
Taxes levied for road and bridge
purposes throughout the state are as
follows: By counties, $2,438,631.71
by cities and villages, $619,598 by
townships, $3,355,594.90. Total, $6-
413,824.61. To this should be added
$1,550,000 by the state, derived from
the general one mill tax and license
fees of motor vehicles, making a
grand total in round numbers for
roads and bridges of $8,000,000.
The Bridge Combine's Work.
It appears that George W. Cooley,
secretary and chief engineer of the
State Highway commission, antici
pated the dastardly attack that the
"Bridge Combine" and its hirelings
launched against the commission on
town meeting day, as the following in
terview with him which appeared in
the Pioneer Press of the 13th inst.,
would indicate:
"On the eve of election we have
been informed that various townships
are being canvassed and the boards
asked to pass resolutions declaring for
the. so-called home rule plan of road
and bridge building and against the
highway commission," Mr. Cooley
said.
Country-wide Fight.
"It is the same attack that is being
made on every highway commission in
the United States. It is fostered by
bridge builders and material men who
object to any central organization
which can assist the counties in se
curing a better class of construction,
which has the facilities for the com
parison of prices and methods of con
struction, and which may reduce the
cost of work to the communities in
terested.
System is Successful.
"The very fact that the attack on
the commission is made at the elev
enth hour shows that it will not stand
the light of investigation. It is the
same character of combinations that
the yaripus cities have experienced in
paving.
"Of the forty-eight states, thirty
have state highway commissions,
while only three are without a thor
oughly organized state department,
so that the central system for hold
ing illegal combinations in check
must be successful.
Satisfied with Engineers.
"Eighty-one of the eight-six coun
ties in Minnesota have by resolution
indorsed the engineers sent to them
by the State Highway Commission,
and have agreed to retain them any
time the funds of thw commission are
not sufficient to keep the corps of en
gineers in tact."
Adjudged Insane.
William F. Quade was adjudged in
sane before Judge Sanford's court on
Monday afternoon, and committed to
the state detention hospital at Fergus
Falls. The examining physicians were
Drs. H. C. Cooney and T. u. Armi
tage.
This is the second time within two
years that Quade has been sent to the
state hospital at Fergus Falls, as he
was adjudged to be a proper subject
for that institution a year ago last
November. The following April he
was paroled, and later discharged. Re
cently he became violent again, and
complaint was filed with the proper
authorities by relatives Saturday.
The patient was taken to Fergus
Falls Monday by Chas. King and E.
Pitmon, who were deputized b*y Sher
iff Shockley as he was unable to go on
account of this being court week.
Fire Department Does Good Work.
Fire gutted the south wing of the
Wm. Miller residence in north Prince
ton Saturday evening, and had it not
been for the prompt and effi
cient work of the fire department,
there is no doubt but what the build
ing and its contents would have been
destroyed.
The alarm sounded at about 8
o'clock, and the department boys were
on the scene shortly thereafter with
the chemical engine. The fire was
soon under control, but was not finally
extinguished until after a second trip
had been made across the river from
the power house, when a few pails of
water applied to the right place
drowned a minor blaze or two that de
veloped after the first visit to the
fire.
The H. McCue and Gust Anderson
families occupied the downstairs and
upstairs of the dwelling respectively,
and considerable of the furniture was
VOLUME XL. NO. 1 5
badly damaged or destroyed by fire,
smoke and water. The loss is parti
ally covered by insurance. The or
igin of the fire is unknown, as Mr.
and Mrs. McCue were not at home at
the time, and it started downstairs.
The members of the fire department
are deserving of credit for their splen
did work in this instance, as the fire
had gained considerable headway
when they arrived. That over half of
the building was saved under the cir
cumstances is ample evidence of their
efficiency.
Mrs. L. P. Southard.
Mrs. L. P. Southard, an esteemed
Princeton pioneer, departed this life
at her home in north Princeton Sun
day morning at 2 o'clock, after an ill
ness of eight months, at the age of 78
years, two months and 26 days.
Funeral services were conducted at
the family residence Tuesday after
noon at 2 o'clock, and numerous
friends and relatives attended to pay
a last tribute to the departed one. A
quartet composed of Mesdames C. A.
Caley and E. B. Service and Messrs.
Guy Ewing and Grover Umbehocker
sang appropriate selections, being ac
companied on the organ by Miss Ei
leen Walker, and Rev. and Mrs. Ser
vice gave a vocal duet. Interment was
in Oak Knoll cemetery, and the re
mains were laid at rest beside those
of her husband and a son.
All of the children attended the fi
nal services except Charles, Fred and
E. L. Charles and E. L. reside in
Washington, and Fred is a resident of
Maine.
Deceased, whose maiden name was
Almeana Bickford, was born in Bel
grade, Somerset county, Maine, on
December 30, 1837. She grew to wo
manhood in Maine, and on January
1, 1854, was united in marriage to Mr.
Daniel Spaulding. To this union were
born three children, all of whom are
living, viz.: Charles H., Fred R., and
Daniel W. Mr. Spaulding answered
the final summons several years ago,
and on March 8, 1865, the subject of
this sketch became the wife of the
late L. P. Southard. Five children
Mrs. Mina Bickford, E. L., I. R., Mrs.
O. B. Newton and Alvahblessed this
union. In the fall of 1879 Mrs.
Southard accompanied her hus
band and family to Minnesota, and re
sided in Minneapolis one year. Since
that time Princeton has been her
home.
Mrs. Southard was a good Chris
tian lady, and possessed qualities that
won her the love and esteem of a
large circle of friends. She was of a
home-loving disposition, and as a
neighbor and friend was all that
could be desired. Besides the child
ren she leaves many grandchildren
and great grandchildren to mourn her
passing.
The children and grandchildren de
sire to express their sincere and
heartfelt thanks to those who so kind
ly assisted them during the last ill
ness and death of their beloved
mother. Dearest mother thou hast left us
And thy loss we deeply feel
But 'tis God that has bereft us
He can all our sorrow heal.
Yet again we hope to meet thee,
When the day of life has fled,
When in Heaven with joy we greet thee,
Where no farewell tears are shed.
Dr. Eric Norelius.
There died at Vasa, Goodhue coun
ty, a couple of weeks ago one of the
grand old pioneers of this state, Dr.
Eric Norelius, at the ripe old age of
almost 84 years.
Dr. Norelius was a native of Swed
en and came to this country in 1850
when he was only 17 years of age.
He had studied some in the old coun
try and completed his education at a
college in Columbus, Ohio.
He first visited Minnesota in 1854,
and preached and taught school at
Chisago Lake in 1855 he located at
Vasa and organized Swedish Luther
an churches there and in several of
the neighboring towns. He has been
president of the Augustana Synod,
the highest honor that can be con
ferred by the Swedish Lutheran
church of America, was created Doc
tor of Divinity by the Augustana
College at Rock Island, 111., and has
been knighted by the King of Swed
en. No man stod higher in the esti
mation of the Swedish people of the
Northwest than Dr. Norelius, and he
was also beloved and respected by all
who knew him.
