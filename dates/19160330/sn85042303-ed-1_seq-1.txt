El Paso, Tex., March 30.
General Pershing has projected
a long and relentless campaign
in the hunt for Villa, a chase
that may last many weeks be
fore the bandit is finally rim
to earth. This information was
gleaned here today from mili
tary men who made no secret of
their belief that Villa had slip
ped through the cordon of Car
ranza troops and American sol
diers. Mexican officials today said
they had no information as to
the whereabouts of Villa. Ru--mors
that Villa raided Santa
Tomas, south of Namiquipa,
are current here today, but
have not been confirmed.
Neither General Carvia at
Juarez, nor Mexican Consul
Garcia here had received news
of the report, and they did not
credit it.

San Antonio, Tex., March 30. Al
though military supplies for the Amer
ican army In Mexico, will be offered
to 'the management ot the Mexican
Northwestern railroad at Juarez for
shipment to the American troops In
Mexico, officers at army headquarters
here regard the conditional use of the
railroad so experimental that the mo
(tor truck Jine from Columbus to the
army in Mexico will be maintained.
. If it is demonstrated that the sup
plies are being held up or Interfered

urge that permission be secured to
place scouts on the train.

HOWARD, LYON AND GAULT ARE
SUPPORTING LAFAYETTE AND
GIVE THEIR REASONS FOR
DOING SO.
Oklahoma March 3 In an inter
view here today, State Auditor E. H.
Jloward, Secretary of State J. L.
Lyon, and Frank M. Gault, president
of the state board of agriculture, sta
ted their cause for approving the
candidacy of Con Lafayette, of Che
cotah, for democratic national con
vention. "We had derided to take no part
in the national committeeman con
test, believing that elected state of
ficials should leave such matters to
those of the rank and file who believe
in party organization. It was not
until we ascertained that certain
members of the state official family
had espoused the cause of Tom Wade
and were spending their time and
money in behalf of the Marlow man
that we decided It time to remon
strate against that sort of machine
politics. All of us hold nothing
against Mr. Wade, but it is unfair
for certain members of the state of
ficial family to use the influence of
positions given by the rank and file
to attempt to dictate to the democ
racy of this state whom they should
select for office. Ben Lafayette has
been a stalwart democrat and has
stood for broad policies and good gov
eminent. No citizen of the state has
done more for his party than Lafay
ette, and Uie fact that his opposition
is largely composed of men who have
determined to build up a personal ma
chine should rally to the Chocotah
candidate all those who oppose ma
chine government. The cry that
"Wade is a west side man'Ms non
sense, as both of the candidates re
side in what was the Iidian Territory
side of the state.

Towerman Ernest Said to Have Lost
Sleep Over Birth of Baby Sunday
Night and Received Little Sleep,
Causing Him to Give Wrong Signal.
Cleveland, Ohio, March 3'i. Twenty-seven
bodies have been recovered
from yesterday's New York Central
wreck 'thus far.
The attention today focused on tiie
federal, state and railroad investiga
tions to determine the responsibility.
So far as the railroad is concerned,
t he responsibility is either upon the
towerman who is alleged to have been
asleep, or upon the engineer, who,
some say, either failed to see the sig
nal or exceeded orders.
The blame for the wreck may be
traced to a baby's tiny crib, if the in
vestigation under way shows that
Towerman A. B. Ernest gave the
wrong signal. Mrs. Ernest gave birth
to a baby Sunday night, and it is said
that Ernest had had Ibut little sleep
since. On the other hand, Ernest
says lie was not asleep and Chat he
knew something was wrong, and gave
the right signal.
DEMANDS OF RAILROADERS
Intimated That Railroaders May Not
Make Uniform Reply.
Chicago, 111., March 30. While the
formal demands of the four railroad
brotherhoods are being made today,
possibly later replies from the rail
rdads are being discussed.
The possibility that the railroads
might not make a uniform reply is
hinted today. The demands are with
out precedent and appears, it is said,
that the railroads are reluctant about
joining in a general movement to
make schedules for all roads regard
less of the individual conditions.
Col. Cecil Lyon Improving.
Sherman, Tex., March 29. Colonel
Cecil A. Lyon, who underwent an
operation for abcess on the liver,
although bis condition is serious, is
improved and physicians consider his
case as very hopeful for his recovery,
it wri stated today.
STYLE WEEK
SEC. GILBERT SAYS SHOW IS
WELL ADVERTISED AND MANY
PEOPLE WILL BE HERE DURING
THE EVENT.
Thousands of personal invitations
to the spring style show have been
mailed out 'by Ardmore merchants, j
and they are having effect. One con-1
cern alone mailed out four thousand i
and none less than 250. Secretary )
Gilbert who came in last night from J
the east, said the style show was well ,
advertised there before lie arrived in j
the territory. Copies of these indi- j
vidual Invitations were shown him
and all were couched in general terms, :
inviting the receiver to Ardmore and j
without any further personal mention
than that which the letterhead of the
writer conveyed.
"Nothing but bad weather will keep
the crowds away," said Mr. Gilbert,
"if 'the manner in which I was receiv
ed can be accepted In sincerity. It is
remarkable the interest manifested in
Ardmore on the outside, aod there is
considerable curiosity as to just how
we have rebui'.t."

CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE IN
DICATES GERMANY WILL DISRE
GARD RIGHTS OF AMERICANS.
SECRET ORDERS
German Submarine Commanders Said
to Have Received Secret Instruc
tions to Continue Submarine War
fare. Washington, March 2). The ac
cumulation of cirrum.stantial evidence
indicating (hat Germany has engaged
upon a campaign of submarine war
faro which has no regard for the
rights of American citizens traveling
on merchant ships of belligerent na
tionality, the administration consid
ers, has created one of the most ser
ious situations which has confronted
the United States since the beginning
of the war in Europe.
Every agency open to the state de
partment tonight was being employed
to gather an unimpeachable array of
facts regarding the explosion which,
damaged the British channel steamer
Sussex, the sinking of the British
ships Manchester Engineer, English
man and Eagle Point, the Dutch
steamer Tubantia and the alleged fir
ing of a torpedo at the French pas
senger ship Patrai .
All of these ships carried Ameri
can citizens and all apparently were
attacked in violation of Germany's
recently renewed assurances to the
Unitud SUites.
The next step ot the United States
is said authoritatively to have been
determined upon. Unless Germany,
In reply to the Inquiries made by the
United States through Ambassador
Gerard, makes some statement to
cause the state department to change
its present Intentions it is understood
that all the recent aggravating inci
dents will be combined into one gen
eral formidable indictment which will
bring the entire subject to a clear
cut issue.
Should Germany admit responsibil
ity for any of the attacks and at
tempt to satisfy the United States
by saying that a mistake had been
made, offer to make reparation and
to punish the submarine commander
the issue would not be by any means
disposed of.
It is regarded as certain that the
