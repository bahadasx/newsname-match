THE HAGUE, Netherlands. Mar. 30.
The latest dividend declarations by
Dm eh shipping companies afford strik
ing testimony to the enormotiB profits
which these concerns are making as
a result of the naval war and the re
sultant shortage In the world's mer
cantile fleet. Messrs. Solleveld van
der Meer and Th. van Haltum's Steam
ship company, for instance, are distri
buting luO per cent out of a gross
profit of $1,000,000, which compares
year. The Hilllgersberg company, on
tl.e other hand, are paying an even
higher percentage, viz., 140, as against
7 per cent. The net profits of this
company amounted to tiO per cent of
the capital. The "Zeevaart" company
lias Just declared a dividend of 50 per
cent, as compared with 10 a year ago;
the Triton company 40, as against 15;
and the Netherlands Lloyd 25, aa com
pared with 9 per cent. Freight rates
from the Netherlands East Indies are
to be raised thus becoming about
three times the amount in vogue be
fore the war.

PRESENT SCHEDULE IS
LY
OBJECTION IS ENTERED TO THE
PROPOSED CHANGE IN TIME
OF TRAIN NO. 23
Whatever might have been the mo
tive for petitioning the state board of
railway commissioners to direct that
the Tonopah & Goldlleld railway and
i he Southern Pacific railroad to change
the time of their train. No. 23, ao
that its connection from Ft. Churchill,
via the Virginia & Truckee railway,
would arrive at Carson City 45 minutes
earlier, the scheme meets with objec
tion in this section. If the train were
to leave Goldfield ana Tonopah that
much earlier It would cause passen
gers to arise before their accustomed
time and would prevent the transac
tion of any business before their de
parture. The present schedule is very
satisfactory, as 23 now arrives in San
Francisco at an early hour in the day.
