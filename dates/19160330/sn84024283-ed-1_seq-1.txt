Big Peach Crop in Sight.
(The Weet Plaint Guette.)
- Present indications point to the fact
that the great Howell and Oregon
county peach belt will have an im
mense crop of peaches this year. Re
ports from Koshkonong, Brandsville,
Olden, Pomotla and other peach
shipping stations state that the peach
buds remain uninjured and conditions
are favorable for a good crop.
The critical period has not yet been
passed. Early frosts in April are
much feared by the growers. While
February has always been feared by
fruit men, there is much clanger in
April, after the peaches have bloomed
and the buds are in their infancy.
According to W. E. Qratton, of
Brandsville, manager of the Ozark
Fruit Farm, the largest peach orchard
in the entire KoBhkonong-Brands-
ville district, the crop this year will
not be as large as that of 1915. The
buds have been swatted to Borne ex
tent by the cold weather early in the
winter and there is no wailing over
this fact.
When the trees are loaded to their
fullest capacity with buds and a ma
jority of the buds mature and grow
peaches, it is necessary to have men
go through the orchards with poles
and thin out the peaches. It this is
not done the trees are over loaded'
and the fruit does not attain large
size. Props must be placed under the
heavily laden limbs to support them,
and this makes more expense for the
grower. If Jack Frost gets in hi6
work and thins out the buds by nature,
the grower is happy.
Paul Evans, director of the State
Fruit Experiment Station at Mountain
Grove, visited Koshkonong last week
and inspected the trees on several
orchards. He found enough live buds
to insure a big crop of peaches. Mr,
Evans says that the fruit gives
promises of being very large, especial
ly if the buds are thinned out.
From W. W. Strother.
Dear Mr. Editor: The article of
last week's Register from Mr. Stith
of Hadley, Missouri, was good as far
as it went, but where it. stopped, it
left me in the wrong pUew viUa- 'tLs
Public School District and all the'
Business Men and many others at
Des Arc. ....!
First, after the property was bought
in it developed that the men who
were running the Nazarene College,
knew, as I did, that the Nazarene
church was not incorporated, and
therefore, had no oharter. This being
the fact, there was no one to deed the
property to. I refused to turn the
property to them until their General
Superintendent got on the grounds
and assured the people that the
- church would make the school go.
Another point was raised by Mr.
Stith in which he said two lawyers had
told him the Nazarene Church could
hold the furniture and fixtures thf y
1 had put in the school since they sign
ed a contract with the original Board
of Trustees, that was handling the
school under the original charter, that
the Holiness Association people had
After Mr, Stith'e statement I told him
and G. W. Wallis that L. L. White and
1 would not help take up the several
notes held by the bank of Des Arc if
the church could come in and take
the stuff the notes was given tor. It
was our understanding the mortgage
covered the whole thing and we would
help pay the debts on the furniture
and leave the property In shape to
carry on the school. While we had
agreed to held take care of the note s,
yet when the fact was made plain
that we were not getting value re
ceived we turned it over to Messrs.
Stith and Wallis, and the church can
handle it to suit themselves.
I offered to Mr. Stith and Wallis
that if they would relieve L. LWhite
and'myself of our part of the $1330.00
and our expenses we would step out
and turn the "whole thing over to
them, and they refused. And before
Mr. Stith left Des Arc he and Mr.
Wallis called me to one side and told
me to try to close a deal with the Des
Arc Fublio School and cell them the
property, as the school election was
near, and as we had told the church
folks we would not lose an -opportunity
of selling the property. So,
Instead of me coming back to Freder
icktown that day, I stayed over and
went to every' business man I could
see and a lot ofcitizens and told them
to get busy if they wanted the prop
erty, and it met the hearty approval
of every man J met except two. ,
, Now I should have written a letter
for the Register as soon as I came
home, but the President of the Con
solidated Store & Mfg. Co.j Lin Oris
ham, got his band scratched In crank
ing bis machine and took - blood
poison, and I was the choice of him
and bis family to stay, with him and
care for him, as he preferred staying
at home to going to St. Louis. Have
been with the company since Decern
bar 2, 1914, and did more than 17,0( 0
of business last year, and and up to
this date I haven't lost a minute's
time. Mr. Grisham was a personal
friend of mine and when I went to fill
a pulpit for any of the preachers, or
go to Conference, he gave me straight
time and furnished me a good horse
and buggy, free, to get out in the
country and preach. One-third the
net profits were mine and now, with
the business that's piled up for the
past twelve days, I am pressed for
time. Last Thursday evening at 8
o'clock Mr. Lin Grisham paeeed into a
better world and left the greatest
testimony I ever heard, and was
happy and ready to change worlds.
Very truly,

Whooping Cough.
Whooping cough derives its name
from the peculiar inspiratory whoopd
following a paroxsym of coughing.
The disease occurs in extensive epi
demics, apparently it is a disease of
fairly modern origin. At least we do
not find it certainly described by an
cient writers.
It is caused by a small germ which
is thrown out in the act of coughing,
consequently it is spread most often by
direct contact of one child with an
other. The germ may, however, be
carried from one person to another
by handkerchiefs, toys, drinking cups,
roller towels and other objects which
become infected with the secretions
of the respiratory tract. It is said
that some of the lower animals, par
ticularly the dog, are occasionally in
fected with whooping oougb, and the
disease may be spread in this manner.
It is contagious from the appearance
of the earliest symptoms, and the
danger of contagion is greater during
the early stages, although it exists
throughout the disease and during
convalescence. ' After exposure, a
period of from one to two weeks
elapses before the appearance of
symptoms. ,
People generally do not realize the
dangerous character of whooping
oough. The death rate in the United
states is about 10,000 a year more
than from scarlet fever. It is par
ticularly dangerous to children under
3 years of age and to those who are
tuberculous.
The principle of prevention Is sim
pie. Since the disease is spread en
tirely by the seoretions from the
respiratory tract, prevention consists
in keeping other children from com
ing In contact With these. Isolation
of patients is necessary. Toys, hand
kerchiefs, eta., should not be passed
from a sick child to well ones. Sick
children should not be allowed to go
to school, theate orpublio assemblies
of any sort. Uwing to the long dura
tion of an attack of whooping cough
and the fact that children are seldom
lllenopgh to be confined to bed, isola
tion is particularly hard to carry out
An abundance of freBh air helps in
the treatmentand there is no objection
to children going out provided they
fiTEXHSWQEDEa '
are in the care of an intelligent person
who will prevent contact with well
children. In some cities, the wearing
of an arm-band marked "whooping
cough" has been tried with apparent
good results. This prevents other
children from coming in close contact
with sick ones. The closer the con
tact, the greater the danger.
A vaccine made from the germ is
quite extensively employed. From
three to four injections are given, and
in a great majority of cases, according
to reports, the disease is prevented.
The same vaccine is used for treat
ment with extremely good results.
While the matter is not yet considered
settled, no harm can come from the
use of the vaccine, and it has produc
ed such favorable results wherever
tried, that its use is to be recommend
ed, especially since no other satisfac
tory form of treatment has yet been
davised. While certain drugs ap
parently have a favorable influence,
none has been found which will stop
the attack, and much harm is often
done by too much drugging.
Efficiency?
Officials of the railroad brother
hoods contend that if the railroads
were compelled to pay overtime
rates, they would see to it that trains
were sent over the road on schedule
time. The proposition,, therefore, is
that the rate of speed be raised to
an average of twelve and one-half
miles, so that runs of 100 miles may
be made in eight hours Instead of in
ten. The same rate now paid for ten
hours would be paid for eight.
Where it possible to increase the
speed as the union men say, the
change would not affect the railroads
to such a great extent, so far as road
service is concerned. But is it pos
sible to so increase the speed? Rail.
road officials say it is not, or it would
be done now as an operating econ
omy. If trains are unnecessarily de
layed, it is an admission of inefllcienoy
somewhere. - American railroad men
are regarded ob being the most ef
ficient in the world, When England,
after the outbreak ot the European
war, established a record for the rapid
transportation of troops to embarking
points, it was an American railroad
man who handled the traffic. He gave
staid old England a lesson in the mat
ter of handling trains.
From a business point of view it
would not seem reasonable that trains
are needlessly held up. Anyone must
see that it is economical to get trains
over the tracks as peedily as Is con
Blstent with safe operation. The pay.
ment df overtime rates to train crews
would hardly appear to be the remedy
for slow operation.

The Preparedness Program.
The tax-payers are now able to sit
in judgment upon the preparedness
program. The army experts ask for
500 millions for the first year and 319
millions per year thereafter. This is
for the army.
The Navy board, according to Ad
miral Fletcher (see press dispatches
printed March 9th) askg for one bll
lion and a half to put the navy in
proper shape, and then 760 millions
per year thereafter to keep it up. This
is not for an "incomparably" greater
navy, such as the president asked for,
but simply for a navy that will EQUAL
any other navy afloat by 1925, and it
is for a navy to equal other navies as
they are NQW--not as they will be
after we spur them on by our new
policy.
In other words, the Army board
and Navy board now demand that the
annual appropriations for army and
uavy shall be MORE THAN QUAD
RUPLED, and that we Bhall perma
nently spend OVER ONE BILLION
per year on army and navy. THIS IS
MORE THAN TWICE THE NET IN
COME RECEIVED BY ALL the
farmers of the United States from all
their crops and yet the jingoes think
that any man who objects to the pro
gram is a "white-livered coward."

Good News.
Many Ironton Readers Have
Heard it and Profited Thereby.
"Good news travels fast," and the
many bad back sufferers in Ironton
are glad to learn where relief may be
found. Many a lame, weak and ach
ing back is bad no more, thanks to
Doan's Kidney Pills. Our citizens are
telling the good news of their ex
perience with this tested remedy.
iiere is an example worm reading:
Mrs. Nellie Rust, Ironton, says:
"One of my family was in pretty bad
shape and suffered almost constantly
from backache, sometimes being
scarcely able to get about. The kid
ney secretions were generally too
frequent in passage, particularly at
night and often painful. Doan's Kid
ney lJiiis, procured at the Arcadia
Valley Drug Co., stopped all that and
we have never been without them in
