Rev. McArthur Leaves
After completing three years
of faithful service to his congre
gation, Rev. J. M. McArthur
preached his farewell sermon at
the Presbyterian church last
Sunday evening. If ever a min
ister'' was conscientious in his
work, awake to the needs and
desires of his congregation, and
determined o do bis duty as he
saw it, certainly Rev. Mr. Mc
Arthur has been, and no more
capable, broad mined minister
has ever filled that pulpit than
he. With his departure not only
.the membersof his congregation
but also all Meade looses a most
valuable asset. Just where he
will locate is at this time unde
cided, but whatever congrega
tion secures his services will in
deed be fortunate. He leaves
Meade with the best wishes of
the entire community, regardless
of creed or church affiliation.

EDUCATIONAL DAY
PROCLAMATION
The second Friday in April having been
'fixed by the statutes of Kansas as the day
for holding the Annual School Meetings in
all rural districts and fn cities of the third
class: .'
And since whatever may be done to im
prove these schools for the coming year
should e determined upon and authorized by
the voters in these 8,815 district meetings to
be held on "April 14th:
And inasmuch as the complete organiza
tion of the school system of this common
wealth along the lines of the best professional,
thought and in harmony with the democratic
principles underlying state education must
depend upon the character and be determin
ed by the development of the rural and town
schools in which neaTly three-fourths of the
children of Kansas are at this) time enrolled:
Therefore I have designated April 14tb,
1916, as Educational Day in Kansas and I
would urge all citizens of this state, and
especially those who are residents of tbe
school districts holding school meetings on
that day, to observe tbe occasion with the
high motive that the coming school year may
be made to be the greatest in the educational
history of the state.
I would especially request the state press
to co-operate with tbe school officials in order
that the widest publicity may be given the
occasion. And I would also urge the church
es of Kansas, of all denominations, the higher
educational institutions, the patriotic organi
zations, the fraternities of labor and the as
sociations of capital, the parent-teachers' or
ganizations, together with all others who de
sire tbe enrichment of community life
through and by the schools, to - unite in ob
serving Educational Day.
In testimony whereof I have hereunto
subscribed my name and caused, to be af
fixed the great seal of the state of Kansas.
Done at Topeka this 18th day of March, A.
D. 1916.
ARTHUR CAPPER, Governor.
The women of Meade are pre
paring to line up for civic better
ment, especially along the line of
cleaning up tbe city. .Several
organizations are taking- the
initiative and hope to secure the
aid of every woman in town.' No
one can afford to be classed with
the careless, dirty element of
the city. Cleanliness means re
spect, health, and possibly an
advance in tbe value of your
property. Lets all get busy.
Civic pride is getting to be a
great fad. We can't afford to
ignore it. xx

Some Real Winter
There was a touch of rean
winter last Saturday. A cold
north wind accompanied by show
and sleet made things decidedly
uncomfortable for several hours.
Previous to this change we had
wind and dust and the thermom
eter hovering around summer
beat, so the sudden turn took us
all a little by surprise. Early
fruit blossoms and flowers got
nipped, but whether or not the
fruit Is killed we can't say. ' By
Sunday afternoon the snow was
melted and the temperature fine
for joy riding.

ed a series of special meetings

Another Fire
A fire at tbe DeWitt farm four
miles north of Meade, last Tues
day would have been serious bad
ji not been discovered just in the
nick of lime ' On Monday Mr.
DeWitt had burned some trash
but supposed that tbe hre was
out, in this, however, he was mis
taken and the next day, all un
noticed the fire started and was
in a pile of wood burning briskly
when it was discovered by Mr.
and Mrs. Wm. Colgan, who live
but a short distance north of tbe
DeWitt farm. A genera call
was at once given and neighbors
soon came to tbe rescue. Other
than the wood which was all
burned and a barrel of gasoline,
which exploded no damage was
done. The remaining pieces of
the barrel were picked up more
than a quarter of a mile away.

she went with her husband to
Mt. Vernon, Ohio, where she
lived about 25 years. Her next
migration was to Meade county,
Kansas, where they lived before
coming to Sarcoxie about 20
years ago. When tbe war broke
out, Mr. Randall left bis family
and enlisted on tbe Union side.
He was captured and taken to '
Libby prison. After a captivity
that seared bis heart, he man
aged to make his escape. One

kept during her life was a letter
from President Lincoln which

her own. asking Mr. Lincolq to
dbbat.fce. could; to secure -the
release oi' her husband.
She was the mother of seven

and Josephine Quigley, Hart
ford, Conn.
During the latter part of her
' life, Mrs. Randall was a confirm
ed invalid, attended devotedly
by her aged husband. A few
days before her death he was
stricken with pneumonia and it
was thought for a time that be
would die before she did. He
rallied, however, and as this is
written there is a chance that be
may recover.
The funeral was largely at
tended, relatives and friends as
sembling to pay a silent tribute
to a woman who had ended a
beautiful life of self-sacrifice and
devotion to those she loved. Sar
