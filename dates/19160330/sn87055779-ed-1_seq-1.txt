The committeemen represented
the Rrotherhood of Roeomotive In

railroads refuse the demands h
strike may result, paralyzing rail
road industry throughout the coun

cially, have declared tha t to rant
the demands in their entirety they
"would put practically every railway
system into receivership.
The demands of the men. if com
plied with, would add at least !!
per cent annually to the cost of
operation. '
In all ca.ses where day workers
are putting in 10 hours or more, the
men asked for an eigrht-hour work
day with pay at the l-hour rate. On
traiti runs where the time put in ex

tame and a half for overtime. They
are getting only the straight rate
now.
The railway men are prepared for
a strike. They have on hand a fund
of $12.000,000, which will enable
them to carry along the battle, if a
strike comes, for two months at
least.

French Machine Guns Mow
Down 15,000 Germans
Near Verdun.
PAH If?. March 30. Nearly an en
tire division was wiped out by
FTench machine guns and "7f's"
when the Germans attacked the po
sitions northwest of Verdun yester
day. The German losses were placed
a 15,000 men.
The lighting around Avoeourt
forest and the village of Malaneourt
is described in dispatches from the
front as "extremely bloody."
From three to seven waves of
(Herman Infantry surged toward the
French trenches. At least 30.0(b)
men were in the attacking forces.
These were mostly drawn from the
Ravarian corps and the 15th re
serve army corps.
The Germans did not get a chance
to engage the French in hand-to-hand
fighting as the ranks were
swept away by the terrific lire from
the French machine guns and French
batteries of artillery before they
reached the trencher.
Refore the infantry assaults were
becun.the French positions were
violently shelled by the Germans
over a five-mile front, but the foot
soldiers attacked along a front only
1,000 yards wide. The object of the
attack was to capture the village of
Malaneourt and Ha icourt in order
to straighten out the German line
on the left side of the Meuse. De
bouching from Malaneourt woods
the Teutons advanced with fixed
boyanets .singing "The Watch on the
Rhine." As the. troops moved into
the open all the French batteries
opened and the ground was swept
with a hail of lead rom the rapid
tlrers. Six assaults wero delivered,
the la.ct two being made after dark
ness had fallen. At one time the
Germans got within 50 yards of the
French positions, but this was the
closest they ever were.
So severe were the German losses
in this four-hour battle that when
the French suddenly attacked their
lines a couple of miles further
south, the Teutons were caught
napping and were driven from their
positions. One thousand fresh troops
tried to win back the lost gro;ind,
but failed.
