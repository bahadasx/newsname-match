ORGANIZED BALL IS
FACING NEW FIGHT
FOR L1FEJN COURT
Baltimore Club of Late Federal
League Suei for Nine Hundred
Thousand Dollars' Damages
Under Trust Laws.
MAKES CONSPIRACY CHARGE
If Action Successful, United States
Government Maj Have to
Take Cognizance.
ALLEGES OUTLAWS SOLD OUT
PHILADELPHIA. March J9.
Organized Base Ball is faring an
other at.ack against its existence In
a suit for $900,000 damages filed in
the United States district court here
today under the national anti-trust
laws by the Federal base ball club
of Baltimore. The defendents In the
suit are the National and American
leagues, and the sixteen clubs, mak
ing up their membership, the three
members of the National base ball
commission, James A. Gllmore,
Charles E. Weeghnian and Harry
Clnclalr, formerly of the Federal
league.
If the Federal league of Baltimore
wins its suit. Organized Base Ball
will be in peril of attack by the
federal government, It is said. The
difference between the suit filed to
day and the one begun by the Fed
eral league against Organized Base
ball in Chicago in January, 1916, Is
that the present action Is one for
damages, while the first one was an
Injunction to restrain Organized Base
Ball from continuing certain acts al
leged to be In violation of the Sher
man anti-trust law.
V. S. Mar IIbtc to Act.
To win the present- action, the Balti
more club must show that Organised
Base Ball as at present constituted is
In violation of the Sherman anti-trust
law and the Clayton anti-trust act. If
It proves this and recovers damages,
lawyers said tonight, the government
may have to take cognisance of the
court's decree.
The Baltimore club alleges that It was
not considered In the negotiations last
wintef which reaulted In the so-called
peace agreement between Organised
Base Ball anl Federal league owners
and that in consequence It suffered a
loss of $300,000 and aaks for triple dam
ages under the federal anti-trust laws.
The eomplalnts gives a history of the
present organization of the gauss and
Its operation, mentioning the National
agreement, the National commtsaton, the
base ball players' fraternity and the
various leagues that enter Into Organ
ised Base Ball. The complaint recites
the organisation of the Federal league,
charges that' Organised Base Ball en
tered Into a conspiracy to wreck It and
goca Into details of the negotiations
whereby the Federal league was elimi
nated from base ball competition.
Charsrea Conspiracy.
The Baltimore club charges that the
National and American leagues are oper
ating In a combination of conspiracy to
restrain trade and have conspired to
monopolise or attempt to monomollse a
part of the commerce of the states In
violation of the federal anti-trust lawa.
The complaint states further that In
the alleged conspiracy to wreck the
Federal league Organised Base Ball
gave or secured to the Brooklyn Fed
eral league club $400,000 to induce that
club to cease competing with the, de
fendants and that by cash contribu
tions of not less than $50,000 and "flat
tery and persuasion," Induced Charles
E. .Weeghman and Ws associate to
leave the Federal league.
The complaint alao states:
"The plaintiff is Informed and believes
and alleges that all of the remaining
constituent members of the Federal
league, not Including the plaintiff, au
thorised a committee consisting, ac
cording to Information of the plaintiff,
of the defendants, James A. Gllmore,
Harry Sinclair and Charlea E. Weegh
man, to settle their position and to pro-
i tect their rights as beat they might, In-
duced thereto, the plaintiff believes and
chances, on account of the realisation
of the hopelessness of repairing the dam
age already done to the Federal league
as a whole by the defection of the ranks
of fts most Important members and that
the committee has now signed sn agree
ment on behalf of all the assenting
members of the Federal league agreeing
to elimlnste further Competition with
the defendants.
Teller's Statement..
NEW YORK. March 29. President
Tener, president of the National league,
when Informed of the suit filed In Phlla-
drlrhla today by the Baltimore Federal
leatrue base ball club, said:
"Organized Base Ball conducted Its ne
gotiations looking to an adjustment of
base ball conditions, not with the llulti
more club, any Individual club or per
son representing a single club or In
terest, but rather mlth the Federal league
as sn organization. It was our under
standing that tha Federal league was
acting for all its component clubs and
had proper authority to so act In every
thing that was done toward a settle
ment of all conditions. In effecting an
sdjustment of baseball conditions we
are satisfied we did nothing Inconsist
ent with the Sherman Anti-trust act or
Clayton act. Therefore, we fall to aee
where we are liable as set forth In the
suit of the Baltimore Federal league
club."

FLYING COLUMNS
ARE CHASING YILLA
American Troopers Reported Closely
Pressing Outlaws in Southern
Chihuahua.
MEXICANS LOSE TRACE OF HIM
EL. PASO, Tex., March 29. The
chase of the brigand Villa by the
flying columns of American cavalry,
goes relentlessly on, but from the
meagerness of the official dispatches
from General Pershing's advanced
base, It was impossible to learn to
day the position of the American
troops and how far they were In the
rear of the fleeing band. Villa waa
last heard of proceeding southward
to the Tarahumare mountain coun
try, his command driving their Mexi
can ponies at full speed and being
closely pressed by the American
tioopers.
Commanders of the Csrrani troops
now In the Chihuahua region apparently
have lost trace of Villa and his men for
no report has been received by Mexican
officials here for some time concerning
Villas' whereabouts. - " '
Armed bands of Vlllistas are reported
In various parts of Chihuahua and In
some numbers around Torreon, but they
are operating independently of the main
Villa's whereabouts.
Will Try to Itecmtt Force.
Carranxa officials In Jusres express
their belief that Villa will try to estab
lish a rr.aln base at some point after ho
has thrown the American cavalry off nls
trail and then recruit his command to
one of large proportions from the Vlllistas
now roaming about the southern Chihua
hua district. Villa, the Carranxa officers
think, will then engaged in a mauraudlng
campaign that would make the American
and Carransa forcea no end of trouble.
Army officers here do not believe Villa
will ever make a stand and fight the
American cavalry, but will contlnu In
flight until he escapes or Is cornered.
Pershing: Wllk Adfssee.
SAN ANTONIA, Tex.. March . Fran
cisco Villa was moving toward Santa
Catarlna, in the Santa Maria valley, four
days ago according to Information se
cured by Colonel Dodd, Sunday, and for
warded to General Funaton today by Gen
eral Pershing.
General Pershing added that the resi
dents of the valley appeared friendly to
Villa and that It was with great diffi
culty that the scouts learned anything
from them regarding his movements.
General Pershing was known to be with
one of the advanced columns today, but
st his own request the positions of hla
troops were not revealed. All detach
ments operating south and east of Naml
qulpa were reported to be pushing for
ward at high speed and from the Am
erican frontier to the last supply base
the quartermaster's department was
working at high pressure to keep moving
the large volume of supplies. As to the
details of the actual chase of Villa, how
ever, General Funaton and his staff knew
little more than the public.
The War department haa returned the
long report of Colonel Hocum on the Co
lumbus attack with, instructions to have
the colonel amplify It. Colonel Slocum Is
commanding troops Just now more than
M0 miles from the border and revision of
his report Is not expected for some time.
It has been sent to him, however.

few blocks of the International railroad
bridge. In addition, train crews have
been enlisted from among .the englneera,
firemen and conductors, who were for

repaired and all trains have to make
their way across the gulches on tempo

mony. In which Miss Cox, principal
wltneaa for the government, described In
detail several alleged meetings with the
defendant. One of these meetings allege!
to have occurred In St. .Paul, Miss Cox

Substitute Army
' Measure Explained
To Upper Chamber
"WASHINGTON. March .-The army
bill was brought Into the senate today
and to a crowded chamber, which list
ened attentively, Chairman Chamberlain
of the military committee gave a de
tailed explanation of the senate measure
and Its purposes and told wny the com
mit tee had dsclded to substitute Its own
bill for the one already passed by the
house rather than attempt to reconcile
differences. He emphasised the need for
action.
The senate bill waa drawn. Senator
Chamberlain explained, after a thorough)
study of all army reorganisation plana,
the Hay bill, tha Garrison bill and the
Chamhberlaln bill.
"Thera are no differences between the
secretary of war and the two military
committees of oongress so serious that
they cannot easily be settled in confer
ence." he said. - "The bill aa finally
Introduced was framed without partisan
or political purpose. It was tha embodl-
ment of the best In all the army bills."
With compulsory training not compul
sor service he declared the cotmtry,
after five years, could absolutely do
away with Its standing army except such
as waa necessary for police duty.
The country, however, he explained,
was not ready for compulsory training,
and voluntary training in Institutions of
learning waa aa far aa the bill had gone.
ftenator Chamberlain blamed congress

MANY INQUIRIES UNDER WAY
CLEVELAND, March 27. With
a toll of at least thirty persona dead
and forty or more In.lured, federal
nnd state officials and officials of the
railroad company have begun an In
vestigation Into the cause which
early today led to one of the most
disastrous wrecks In tho history of
I he New York Central's lines.
Three trains, Including the Twen
tieth Century Limited, westbound,
the New York Central's palatial flier
and two sections of No. 86, known as
the Chicago-Pittsburgh Limited, east
bound, came together In collision
near Amherst, o., thirty-seven miles
west of Cleveland.
Three Thrown Together.
Hcports generally credited were thst the
first snd second sections of No. 89 were
proceeding st a rapid rate and at some
points were only a mile or so apart when
the second section crashed Into the first
section, tho Twentieth Century plowed
Into the wreckage of the first two trains
which bulged over from the parallel
tracks and the three were thrown to
gether Into a mass of debris.
The roaches and the engines of No. M
were toppled over end wreckage wss piled
thirty feet high. Two cars were smashed
to Junk. Fourteen coaches were ever
turned. General Manager Moon In an official
Statement said this coach wss a "modern
solid steel coach." Passengers and oth
ers who were on the scene did not all
agree aa to tha correctness of this state
ment, many contending that the coach
was of wooden construction. Those who
dispute the sssertlon that tha coaches
were sll of solid steel pointed to tha fact
that the car In which the fire atarted
the "death coach," aa they called it
was torn Into small fragments, which
burned like tinder.
Moon's Statement.
Mr. Moon Issued the following state
ment: , ,
"About I !Q this morning first No, M.

tion. "The rear ear ef first No. M, which
contained all passengers who were either
killed or seriously Injured, waa a mod
ern solid steel coach. This car and the
next car ahead, a steel under-frame club
car, were thrown over on the westbound
