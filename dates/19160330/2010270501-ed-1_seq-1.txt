STATEMENT BY MAYOR R(M
ON HEATING PROPOSITION
Mayor Romig Issues Statement to the Voters of Alliance Regarding
Steam Heating Proposition
TO THE VOTEKS OF ALLIANCE:
The city administration has Been
it to place upon the ballots for your
expression as to whether or not the
ity shall install a municipal heating
plant
In the first place, I might say that
there is no question as to a plant of
this kind being a paying proposition.
This fact has been proven by figures
ecu red by cities that have such
plants In operation. There is no
sjvestlon as to the supply of steam,
M at the present time we hare suf
ftolent exhaust steam going to waste
that would more than take care of
the consumption for heating under
rdinary conditions. During extreme
old weather It would be necessary to
ee both boilers. This would no
doubt mean additional help at our
pwer plant. The question has been
asked me as to the cost of the steam
ia comparison with the ordinary
stove or furnace. Practically speak
ing, there is very little difference.
The question of the economical use
mt this steam is purely a matter of
Vacation as to its use. From in
formation that I have secured from
ther cities, it is shown that the dif
ference the first winter is very little,
wing to the fact that the users have
Mt learned to use it properly, after
toe first year the steam showed a
ght reduction In cost over the conl
boating process.
I do not believe there is a single
ember of the council that does not
took with favor upon the heating
plants and would be more than ready
to vote for this proposition If a way
waa shown whereby it could be in
stalled without additional cost to the
tax payers, and also if there were
ready finances to handle the proposi
tion. At the present time our general
land is exhausted. We have at this
Ume in the light and water fund the
am of $11,693.14, i:;luding the
holding by the light department of
12,950 worth of registered warrants.
We will in a few weeks let a contract
far the installing of a 500.000-gallon
APPLICATIONS REJECTED
Alliance Ijuid Office lU-jertti Applica
tions of People Who WKh to
File on Irrigated tanri
Applications for previous filings
were made by parties on three of the
tracts allotted at the land drawing
VAflt Friday by the United States land
office. These applications were mart'
by parties who claimed that the land;
a question were pari of previous
omestead units and which were re
turned to the government when the
previous homesteaders were allow eel
nly eighty-acre tracts.
The local land office refused she
filings on these tracts and the parti
have appealed the matter to Wash
ington. The applications were as
follows:

tract nu ber 1 at ihe drawing, and
was won by Kdl.y J. Ktly. Kear

fused a previous filing.
Tract nun. ber 3. the E of the
NWV4 of ::-22-53, won by Mary A.
MrDermott of Alliance, is another
tract on which a previous filing was
maV and refused.
riwrles Walters was one of the
parties who filed on tract number 9.
con.prlsed of land in 5-21-51 and 32-22-51.
won by Wm. F. Peterson of
Bayard. Mr. Walters has contested
' ' the right of Mr. Peterson to the land
od the grounds that he also mad fil
ing and In addition made settlement
on the land at 9 o'clock Friday morn
lag, March 24. Although not the
winner at the drawing. Mr. Walters
bates bla claim to the land on the
Xwt that be made settlement prior to
reservoir, which when completed will
cost the city In rdund figures 10
000, leaving a balance that would be
available for other purposes of fl,
693.14, or about $8,000, by the mid
dle of October. It is absolutely nec
essary that a good part of our elec
tric street wiring be replaced this
spring, as the loss through defective
wiring amounts to about 6,000 K. W.
a month. Taking these facts into
consideration and setting aside a sum
for depreciation there would be avail
able at the completion of the heating
plant not more than $6,000. Then
where would the balance necessary to
pay for the Installation be secured?
Before going further I might say that
the cost of installing this heating
plant, the placing of the mains from
the plant to First and Dox Butte,
hence to the Intersection of Sixth
street, would be approximately $22,
000. The cost of the tapping of the
mains and the laying of the pipes
from that main to the business
places and also the installing of the
heating radiators must be borne by
the consumer. I might say that I
look with disfavor upon any plan
whereby any part of our city proper
ty would be mortgaged for this pur
pose. The city could not grant a
franchise without a vote of the peo
ple, nor would the people of our city
vote In favor of a bond covering this
proposition. However. the city
could make a five-mill levy each year
for this purpose, and this would
mean additional taxes. With this
plan the plant could not be installed
for several years. The only proced
ure that I can see then would be the
issuing of warrants covering the
amount of installation. This would
be sharp practice but still the only
possible way that the matter can be
handled.
The proposition is up to the vot
ers. The law makes it mandatory on
part of the council to rind some way
to build this plant should the voters
decide that the city shall proceed.

Proclamation
Realizing the importance of civic co-operation in the en
deavor to bring about a more clean ami military condition in
streets, alleys, ami private, premises;
Therefore, T, Penrose K. Romig, mayor of the city of Alli
ance, Nebraska, by virtue of the law vested in me, lo hereby
set aside the week of April 10th as clean-up and painl-up week.
The great importance attached to a movement of this kind
from a sanitary, health, and fire protection standpoint should
recall to the minds of our citizens the great conflagrations that
have occurred during the past month destroying millions of
dollars worth of property and rendering thousands of persons
homeless.
I, therefore, urge, that all organizations of commercial en
deavor, clubs, societies of public welfare, school children, and
all persons residing within the city of Alliance, co-operate in
making Alliance one of the cleanest and healthiest cities in the
state of Nebraska.

la an eftort to frustrate the at

their child from them, Mr. and Mrs.
Luther Brumley and baby were taken
into the country a few days ago by
Ed Miller and as a result the latter is
being given a hearing this afternoon
in county Judge Berry's court for
contempt of court.
A few days ago it was discovered
by parties interesting themselves in
the condition of children of Alliance
that conditions obtaining in the home
of Mr. and Mrs. Luther Brumley are
such that it would be out of the ques
tion to allow the babe, only three
weeks old, to remain there. In coun

the protest of the parents, County
