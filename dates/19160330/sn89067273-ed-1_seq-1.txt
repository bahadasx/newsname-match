L. R. Ferris is the best story teller
in Mexico. He can always entertain
and instruct. He loves a boy, and of
course much to interest them. Ht is
often called before the classes in the
public school, to give his delightful
and instructive talks. Lately, since
his recent trip thru Texas and over
into the border of Old Mexico, he
has had something specially inter
esting to tell. One very funny one
he has on the Mexican bachelors,
who cook their own meals. They
mix their dough with their hands,
but never wash their hands except
when it rains. What we wanted to
say in this paragraph is, that one of
Mr. Ferris' interesting articles ap

FOR A NEW COUNTY JAIL.
x By H. P. Warden.
Mexico, Mo., March 22, 1916.
Editor Mexico Message:
Something has recently been pub
lished in, your valuable paper in re
gard to the building or not building
of a new county Jail.
I beg to state that I have recently
had occasion to visit our county jail
and to look in at the "Black Hole of
Calcutta," where the county keeps
its prisoners in confinement.
I wish to say, Mr. Editor, that if
the present day, civilized, Christian,
intelligent peopl'j of this county
would now go to that jail and see
for themselves, and know what a
crime against humanity is being per
petrated here in our civilized county
a storm of protest would arise, and
a new modern, well ventilated
place of confinement would shortly
be built.
We may talk about the "Inhuman
ltties" of warfare in a foreign land,
and with a self-righteous feeling im
agine that we are very humane here
in Audrain county, but there is noth
ing more inhuman, uncivilized and
barbarous than to force a human be
ing into a close damp den of im
pure air that will endanger his life,
weaken his constitution with disease
and impair his ability to make a
living in the years to come.
Such treatment is barbarous and
cruel even if the prisoner is guilty.
But he may be an innocent man.
The Iron cage where blacks and
whites are indiscriminately turned
for want of room seems to be overly
crowded and full. The atmosphere
is damp, foul and odoriferous. It
could not be otherwise under the
present unsanitary arrangement. The
jail was built years ago when little
attention was paid to ventilation and
sanitary conditions. It has been
condemned by the grandjuries of the
county for years and years.
Why should not a civilized people
have a sanitary place to confine its
human beings who are charged with
crime, especially in Audrain, where
it is understood that the. county has
something like $25,000 of idle and
available funds that could be used
in building a jail, and thus wipe
away the standing reproach?

CLOSE OF SCHOOL AT PISGAH.
Friday evening, March 10, marked
the close of school at Pisgah School
House. Miss May Hofriehter had one
of the most successful terms ever
taught In the Pisgah District. She
came to this district highly recom
mended by Audrain County Superin
tendent and also by the schools where
she had taught. She far surpassed
recommendations to the satisfaction
of directors, pupils and patrons of
the district.
She had an enrollment of 23 and
attendance was the best we have had.
her love for her work, and her pu
pils, combined with interest and tf
tort for their welfare and advance
ment prompted the children to love
their work and to form a determina
tion not to be absent a day. Advance
ment was not only thorough but rapid
Her program showed the wisdom
of her selections and the acting
showed her skllle training. A full
house waa greeted with a high class
entertainment. Considering the crowd
the order was good, except a bunch
of boya from Sturgeon who amused
themselves tearing books, etc. For
such no entertainmtnt has any charm
and truly they are reaping a bounti
ful harvest of censure, justly merited.
Mlsa Hofrelhter leaves this district
for her home near Molino followed
by the best wishes of the community
with the hope that she will accept
the proposition to teach the next
