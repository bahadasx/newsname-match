NINOT AUTO
CO. INCREASES
CAPITAL STOCK
THE DIRECTORS OF THE MINOT
AUTO CO. AUTHORIZE THE IS­
SUANCE OF $40,000 MORE OF
ITS COMMON STOCK.
The Minot Auto Company was in­
corporated in 1912 with a capital stock
of $50,000 and, later, their directors
authorized the capital stock to be in­
creased to $100,000, but no extra stock
had been issued until the present time.
Up to this date stock to the amount
of $46,000 has been issued and their
present increase of $40,000 has been
turned over to the different members
of the company, who previously held
stock in proportion to their holdings,
with the exception of $5,000, which
amount of stock has been distributed
among the heads of the different de­
partments.
The officers of the Minot Auto Com­
pany have satisfied themselves, that it
will greatly increase the efficiency of
all the different departments to have
the heads of these departmnts stock­
holders of the company. As the stock
of the Minot Auto Company has been
paying since its organization an aver­
age of from 50 to 150 per cent a year,
this stock in the hands of these em­
ployes will mean an increase in their
salaries of approximately three to five
dollars a day.
The officers of the Minot Auto Com­
pany also have in mind a plan, which
they hope to work out later on, where­
by all employes will become interested
in the company. This plan, they feel
certain, will increase the efficiency of
their entire working force to the high­
est point possible, which really will re­
sult in better service for the public.
The Minot Auto Company have at
all times paid the highest salaries of
any concern doing business in the city,
and with this new plan in operation
they will be, without question, far in
the lead. Their pay-roll heretofore
has been in the aggregate over $30,000
Sertheir
1%{
year—all of which has been spent
employes in Minot. This new
plan will increase their pay roll to be­
tween $35,000 and $40,000.
DEFINITE SERVICE
AT
WHAT IT MEANS AND HOW IT
CAN BE CARRIED OUT TO BEN­
EFIT CAR OWNERS.
Without any stretch of the imagina­
tion one can readily see where the re­
tail buyers of Studebalcer cars are
going to get service far in advance of
anything similar yet put in operation
in this section by any concern.
Most automobile companies, if they
give any service at all, offer their
buyers a labor coupon good for a cer­
tain number of hours of repair work,
and leave it to the owner as to when
he shall receive this service. In that
case a man is inclined to "save" his
free service hours and he won't bring
his car to the garage until something
serious happens. Then, likely as not,
his repair bill far exceeds his free
labor coupon. Other concerns simply
tell their owners to "drop in" if any­
thing happens Still others have not
even a place to "drop" into.
Not so at Champlin's. They are
equipped to give Studebaker owners
the service they advertise. When a
man buys a Studebaker car from the
Champlin Implement Co., he is given
a card showing seven inspection dates,
covering a period of six months, and
on each of these days he is expected to
bring his car in for inspection. The
day before the inspection date the
owner will receive a card reminding
him to be sure to have his car in for
inspection, whether he thinks it is
running all right or not.
When the car is delivered at the
garage, the workman will make the
examination, adjustments, oilings, etc.,
and will turn the car back to the own­
er in perfect running condition. No
charge will be made for the work, but
only for the gas, oil, grease and such
supplies used. If the mechanics
should find anything wrong with the
car, due to abuse or neglect on the
part of the driver, the owner will be
notified and will be shown how to op­
erate and care for his car properly.
It will be a regular training school
for Studebaker owners and is design­
ed to nurse them over the "green"
jstage of their ownership and educate
•them up to the place where thy will be
^able to operate their cars with the
most pleasure and least expense. The
first six months is the critical stage
in the life of an automobile. If a
man can bring his car through that
precarious period in good condition it
is a real insurance that he won't have
any reason to style his "boat" a
"lemon" later on.
Pete Scott Got 3 2-3 Years for Perjury
Peter Scott, who was convicted in
district court of having committed per­
jury while testifying in his own be­
half in the trial of a case in which he
was charged with keeping and main
taining a common nuisance, was sen-
tenced today to three years and eight
months in the state penitentiary.
Ed Johnson, who was convicted on
a charge of forgery, was sentenced to
two years and six months in the pen­
itentiary.
HATE WONDERFUL
ENAMELING PLANT.
Dodge Brothers Develop Special
Equipment that Marks Big
Advance.
The remarkable finish of the all
steel bodies of Dodge Brothers motor
cars is always the subject of admira­
tion where motor enthusiasts gather
for comparisons, and this has led to
many conjectures as to how the fin­
ish is applied.
The department in which the bodies
are enameled in the plant of Dodge
Brothers at Detroit was developed
within the plant and a portion of the
process is secret.
The steel bodies are carefully pre­
pared for the reception of the enamel,
which is applied in a manner develop­
ed in the plant, and are then conveyed
through a battery of ovens approxi
materly 1,000 feet long, by a double
chain system.
When they emerge, the enamel has
been baked on and has the high lustre
that has attracted so much attention.
The entire installation cost more
than $150,000 and many parts of it
are exclusively Dodge Brothers. The
heat is automatically controlled by
electricity and the temperature is
maintained evenly within five degrees.
The heat loss is but four per cent, so
carefully has insulation been worked
out.
The ovens have a capacity of 1,500
completely enameled bodies every 24
hours."
C. N. TO MAKE
IMPROVEMENTS
STARTS LARGE ADDITION TO
FREIGHT HOUSE—WILL RE­
BUILD COAL SHEDS AND BUILD
ADDITIONAL TRACKS.
The Great Northern Railway Co.
will soon start the construction of a
300-foot addition to its freight depot
located at the foot of Main street. The
business of the company has become
so large that more room, is necessary.
When the freight depot was construct­
ed several years ago, it was believed
that the building would serve its pur­
pose for at least 25 years, but the city
is growing at such a rapid rate, that
larger quarters must be prepared im­
mediately.
The company will soon tear down
the old coal sheds, east of the freight
depot, and construct them on another
site. A mile of additional trackage
will be built in the yards and it is
said the main track will be run north
of the roundhouse. The Great North­
ern is planning on spending tens of
thousands of dollars on improvements
in the city this. year.
NON-PARTISAN LEAGUE
ENDORSED CANDIDATES.
Delegates to a Non-partisan League
convention held in Minot Saturday,
nominated the following members for
the legislative ticket from the 29th
district, which comprises Minot and
surrounding territory:
For State Senator. J. W. Smith, of
Surrey, who has served two terms in
the lower house.
For Members of the House—How­
ard Wood, R. W. Beighle, J. E. Erb
and Anthony Walton.
The men selected are farmers who
have been prominently identified with
the Non-partisan League since its or­
ganization a year ago. Mr. Walton
resides in Minot, but manages his
farm, spending considerable time
there. He is chairman of the commit­
tee on the site for the Equity Pack­
ing Plant.
The convention adopted the follow­
ing resolutions:
"Whereas, A bill known as the
Moss-Hollis rural credit bill now pend­
ing in congress, being a makeshift to
defeat the purpose of an honest, from
the-ground-up, rural credit system,
and
Whereas, Said Moss-Hollis bill, if
it becomes a law, will work to the
benefit of the banking system as
against the farming interests of this
nation.
"Therefore, we, the undersigned
farmers of Minot, N. D., petition you
to use your vote, and your utmost in­
fluence, for the defeat of this bill.
"Respectfully submitted:
"C. M. Anderson, J. E. Erb, Robert
Waldref, C. L. Matson, J. M. Reiner,
R. W. Beighle, H. R. Wood, B. Sol
berg, O. P. Olson, Anthony Walton, H.
Widdel, M. D. Graham and J. F.
Bailey."
Reception for Mr. and Mrs. Sigerseth.
Mr. and Mrs. O. P. Sigerseth were
tendered a pleasant surprise at the
Sons of Norway hall Sunday after­
noon, fifty of their friends gathering.
The couple were married last fall, but
their friends waited until this time,
upon the completion of the new hall,
to give them the proper kind of a re
1 ception. Speeches were made by R. A.
Nestos, John K. Sveen and Isaac Matt
son. Mrs. Richardson sang a solo and
Miss Morrison rendered a pinao solo.
The couple were presented with a nice
sum of money as a token of the hig[h
esteem in which they are held by their
many friends.

FLYING ADVANCE GUARD—MO­
TORISTS WILLING TO RACE
CAVALRY IN PURSUIT OF VIL­
LA.
El Paso, Tex., March 29.—Owners
of 140 Maxwell cars, living in. and
around El Paso, have banded together
and have offered their services and
their cars to Gen. Pershing of the
United States Army, for use as he
sees fit in any movement of troops.
The mo'torists have all signed an
agreement to place their cars at the
disposal of the army. Many of them
have expert knowledge of the roads
through northern Mexico. The cars
are all in shape for instant service.
While the roads of northern Mexico
are far from ideal, the country be­
tween El Paso and the populous dis­
tricts of Chihuahua is such that motor
cars can travel almost anywhere, with
the occasional help of a small crew of
workmen who can smooth out the
roughest parts.
Motor Cars and Cavalry.
The scouring of the mountains for
Villa is logically the function of cav­
alry. This would leave the patrol of
the roads and the movement on the
various Mexican towns along the line
to infantry or to the motoring contin­
gent.
The Maxwell fleet is great enough
to provide swift transportation for 600
men and their marching equipment—a
force probably large enough to do any­
thing except engage in a pitched bat­
tle with a large, hostile army.
That the United States would fight
its next war in motor cars was pre­
dicted some time ago by Walter E.
Flanders, president of the Maxwell
company. It was this suggestion
which galvanized the Texas Maxwell
owners into concerted action under
the leadership of the Buquor Motor
Co., El Paso Maxwell distributors.
Pershing Accepts.
The formal transfer of the cars was
an impressive sight. The owners
gathered at the Buquor garage, filling
the streets for several blocks. The
route to Fort Bliss, where the formal
tender of the cars was made, was lined
with cheering Americans and scowling
Mexicans. The tender, was made to
General Pershing by A. P. Buquor and
the motorists were assured that if con­
ditions made possible the use of their
cars in the suggested way, the offer
would be accepted.
Moving picture operators registered
the parade and the ceremony for re­
production all over the country as an
evidence of Texas patriotism and pre­
paredness.

FLOUR
TO FEED ARMY
OVER QUARTER MILLION BAR­
RELS OF FLOUR MANUFAC­
TURED IN MINOT DURING 1915.
The Minot flour mills are doing a
whole lot to bring the name of Minot
before the people of the United States,
the product from the two mills here
going to almost every state in the
nation.
Last year the production was great­
ly increased over 1914, and according
to figures compiled by the Association
of Commerce this week it is apparent
that flour and f&ed is one of the great­
est things Minot has. The following
table tells the tale:
No. of pounds of flour man­
ufactured in 1915 40,116,223
No. of pounds of feed man­
ufactured in 1915 21,175,290
Total product of Minot
mills 61,291,513
This means that 246,383 barrels of
flour were manufactured here in 1915,
each barrel weighing 155 pounds. This
flour made into one-pound loaves of
bread would feed a large army from
along time, and best of all that army
would have the best bread ever baked.
Arrived With Five Emigrant Cars.
On Tuesday of this week, Seth B.
Moffit, until recently a resident of the
eastern part of North Dakota, arrived
at Minot with fiv% emigrant cars, load­
ed with twenty-one head of splendid
horses and mules, sixteen head of
milch cows and heifers, threshing ma­
chine, and a complete set of farming
machinery and liousehold goods, to
be placed on his half section farm
five miles northeast of Minot, pur­
chased by him late last fall through
the Brusn-McWilliams Company of
Minot. Mr. Moffitt is a well-to-do and
progressive farmer who has made
good in the country where he comes
from, and inasmuch as the farm he has
purchased here is one of the best in
the country, we do not hesitate to pre­
dict that he will be one of Ward
county's most prosperous farmers
within a very few years. 'His wife
and family will arrive in a few days.
Gertrude, daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Wm. Fisher of Berthold, submitted to
an operation at St. Joseph's hospital.
She has had a weak ankle all her life
which made it necessary for her to
wear a brace.

EXPERT MEOIANK
FOR OVERUW CARS
MINOT AUTO CO. HAS EMPLOYED
SERVICES OF EXPERT TO IN­
SPECT ALL OVERLAND CARS
GRATIS.
The Minot Auto Company, distrib­
utors of Overland cars, has provided
the gratis services of an expert me­
chanic for all Overland and Willys
Knight owners—regardless of the year
the car was bought or of whom pur­
chased. Overland and Willys-Knight
owners may now enjoy the privilege
of having their car inspected and
minor adjustments made free of
charge at any time it is brought to the
Minot Auto Company's place of busi­
ness,—whether the car was purchased
of them or through some other dealer.
The Minot Auto Company is desir­
ous that all Overland and Willys
Knight owners avail themselves of
the assistance of their service me­
chanic, whose sole duties are to take
good care of all owners of cars man­
ufactured by the Willys-Overland
company, regardless of when or of
whom they were purchased. His ser­
vices are absolutely free to these own­
ers.
The inauguration of this service is
a step forward in a direction that will
be appreciated by every Overland own­
er, and such service all manufacturers
of the standard makes of cars, who
expect to increase their sales, will be
obliged to install, as the buying pub­
lic of today is looking as much for
service as for the value of the car
itself. It is the aim of the Willys
Overland company to keep the owners
of their cars absolutely satisfied at
all times, and one will not find an
Overland or Willys-Knight owner who
is not a booster.
The Minct Auto Company has a
stock of repair parts at Minot that
will inventory over $25,000 and Over­
land dealers in territory under their
control also have stocks of parts that
will aggregate $25,000 more. The Mi­
not Auto Company also have authority
to make their own adjustments of any
parts from Overland or Willys-Knight
cars that may pnjve to be defective.
Overland owner® are accordingly able
to gfwure much better service in every
waA^than the owners of other makes
of* ears. One can travel froVa coast
to eoa^t and it will be found that there
is practically no town or city where a
meal can be obtained that Overland
Service and Overland Repair Parts
cannot be secured. This efficient ser­
vice means a great deal to Overland
owners, especially those who enjoy
touring in their cars, and salesmen,
who use their cars for business pur­
poses.
CAPTURED DEER
MAY BE SET FREE
TRENTON PEOPLE COMPLAIN TO
O E N O S A I N E E
SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN TAK­
EN UP WILLISTON WANTS
MINOT TO HAVE NONE.
It is possible that the deer recently
caught on the ice of the Missouri near
Williston may be turned loose. When
Chief Game Warden McCutcheon of
this city received word that there were
numerous deer on an island in the
Missouri, and they would perish unless
taken to shore, he hurried there with
his assistants, ran the deer onto the
ice and roped them Four of them
died later, but the others were to have
been placed in the parks at Williston
and Minot.
It is entirely possible that the deer
will be turned loose. Governor L. B.
Hanna has received numerous com­
plaints from Trenton, claiming that
the deer would not have perished and
they urge that the deer be given their
freedom.
Willistonites objected strenuously
to the game warden's sending any of
the deer to Minot. One prominent cit­
izen threatened to tear down the cor­
ral and turn them all loose before he
would see Minot get any of them for
our parks.

FARMER IS DEAD
JOSEPH MORITZ PASSED AWAY
TUESDAY EVENING, SHORTLY
AFTER HIS RETURN FROM MI­
Joseph Moritz, a prominent farmer
residing six miles west of Deering,
died Tuesday night. While he had
been ailing from kidney trouble 'and
blood pressure for t,&me time, he had
not been bedfast and his death comes
as a great surprise to his many
friends- Mr. Moritz came to Minot
Sunday to consult a physician and
left Tuesday afternoon. He was seen
on the streets of the city, apparently
no worse physically than he has been
for some time. Physicians warned him
that his condition was serious and ad­
vised him to return home and not ex­
ert himself. It is presumed that he
died in Deering, before he could get
home.
Mr. Moritz had lived in this vicinity
for more than a decade. He leaves a
wife and two children, besides several
step children. A brother, Felix Mor­
itz, resides near Deering.
OLD ESTABLISHED TAILORING
AND CLEANING COMPANY
GUARANTEE SATISFACTION.
In this issue the Halsey Tailoring
Company, who have the most modern
cleaning plant in the western part of
the state, are offering the out-of-town
trade a most liberal proposition to
send them their dry cleaning by par­
cels post with the guarantee that the
work will be satisfactory or there will
be no charge.
Mr. C. L. Crandall, their new man­
ager, says that he believes the men
and women of the rural districts are
discarding valuable clothing because
they do not realize that by the new
cleaning process its appearance can
be made almost as good as new. In
proof of his ability to please, he of­
fers to clean and repair any articles
sent them during the month of April,
together, with the coupon which ac­
companies their advertisement in this
issue, and to return them by parcels
post prepaid,—with the understanding
that they are not to pay anything for
tin work until after they ha /e had an
opportunity to examine it. If his pat­
rons are not entirely satisfied. Mr
Crai.dall merely asks that they write
him or the Halsey Tailoring Company
a letter explaining why.
The Halsey Tailoring Company have
been in business in Minot for the past
ten years and their remarkable suc­
cess in the Dry Cleaning and Tailoring
business, as evidenced by their present
large patronage, recommends them to
the public.
New Trust Company Organized.
Incorporation papers have been is­
sued by the secretary of state to the
Bankers' Trust Company of Minot.
The capital stock is $100,000. For
some time it has been apparent that
this city should be the headquarters
for a company of this kind. In fact,
rumors that several different groups
of men were about to organize & trust
company have been rife about the
city for several months.
Among the incorporators of the
Bankers' Trust company are the fol­
lowing well-known Minot business­
men: H. J. Halvorson, E. A. Long, H.
E. Shearn, Fred L. Anderson, Newell
R. Olson and G. W. McWilliams.
This company will do a general
trust company business and it is ex­
pected that offices will be opened for
business in this city in the very near
future.

SECTION
MINOT MARKETS
HUMN BUSTTLS
GREAT INITIAL MARKET FOR
GRAIN IN 1915—OVER MILLION
AND ONE-QUARTER DOLLARS
PAID OUT IN THIS CITY.
The Association of Commerce has
compiled the figures on the number of
bushels of grain sold in Minot during
the year 1915, and the amount of
•money paid out to farmers of this vi­
cinity for the same, that are really
startling.
The following table will show the
kinds of grain marketed in Minot dur­
ing the past year, with the amount of
money realized for each kind:
Bushels Amount
Wheat 1,019,057! $1,016,502.19
Flax 57,256i 108,614.00
Oats 141,089 47,768.21
Buckwheat 1,200 1,350.00
Barley 105,575 58,938.10
Spelts 3,000 1,500.00
Rye 42,516 35,682.35
Total 1,369,693 $1,270,354.85
It will be noticed by the above table
that a comparatively new grain has
made its bow in this locality in the
matter of buckwheat. It has been
said for years by some of the old
timers that buckwheat could be suc­
cessfully raised here, and in the years
to come it is expected that more of it
will find its way to market in Minot.
Minot has always afforded an ex­
cellent market for the farmers, and
since the two flour mills are located
here the market is even better than
before. It is expected that 1916 will
show an even greater number of bush­
els of grain marketed in Minot than
during the year 1915, as there is ap­
proximately one-third of the wheat
still in the farmers' granaries from'
last year, the long winter, with the
deep snow making it hard to haul
grain until recently.
It is estimated that 30 per cent of
the wheat raised in the Minot territory
is still in the bins. Only 20 per cent
of the oats has been marketed and
much flax is still in the possession of
the growers.

New Commission Firm Locates Here.
Chas. E. Lewis & Co., brokers of
Minneapolis, are opening a grain
commission office in this city, in rooms
11 and 12 of the hew Jacobson build­
ing. Todd W. Lewis of Minneapolis

The company will maintain a direct
wire to Minot.
WILLARD WON ON POINTS.
Minot fans bet some money on the
Willard-Moran ten-round bout which
