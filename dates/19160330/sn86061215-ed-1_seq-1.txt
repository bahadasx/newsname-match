LITTLE CHANGE
VILLA WILL BE
American Cavalry Unable
to Catch Up With Fast
Ponies of Bandits
SEEMS CERTAIN HE
WILL REACH HOME
Once in Waste Lands, Task
of Getting Him Will
Prove Enormous
Washington, D. C., March 29.—
Gen. Carranza has agreed to per
mit the movement of supplies to
the punitive expedition in Mexico
over the Mexican-Northwestern
railroad. The supplies will go as
commercial freight to concerns in
Mexico with which the army has
contracts.
The permission for use of the
railroad ie not granted In a mili
tary sense and does not cover the
movement of troops for which the
American army has not asked. It
will, however, enable Gen. Per
shing's force to get supplies In
abundance In a country where
motor truck trains can not carry
them and will thus aid immeasur
ably In the pursuit of the Villa
bandits.
El Paso, Tex., March 29—
Some
where amid the grim and forbidding
extinct volcanoes of the great con
tinental divide, Pancho Villa is flee
ing southward today. Hard on his
trail, the cavalrymen of the United
States army are straining every nerve
to catch up with him ..before he can
reach the wastes, almost unknown to
qny but Mexicans and Indians, in
which he began his career as a bandit
years ago.
In the absence of any official news
of the chase, the border has settled
down to speculation. Little optimism
is expressed regarding a speedy ter
mination of the task before Gen. Per
shing's columns. Americans familiar
with Mexico are unanimous in their
opinion that the troopers of the north,
operating In an unfamiliar country
and riding the corn fed horses of the
plains, are tremendously handicapped
against the Mexican bandits on their
mountain bred ponies. It Is not a
question of nerve or courage. It is a
problem of climatic, topographic and
other natural conditions against
which the stoutest heart and strong
est muscles are helpless.
An American rancher, one of the
few foreigners familiar with the coun
try through which Villa is retreating,
said:
Have Speedy Ponies.
"Villa and his men, mounted on their
Mexican ponies, can travel forty miles
a day with ease and fifty miles if
pressed. All his men need is a little
dried beef and some cornmeal," said
this American. With this and a blank
et strapped behind their saddles they
can travel indefinitely. Compare this
with the equipment of an American
trooper who makes thirty-live miles
a day at best.
This rancher was asked what dif
ference he thought the introduction of
aeroplanes in the chase was going to
make.
"I hardly think they will prove of
any great assistance," he said. "In
the first place the aviators will be
starting from an altitude of 8,000 to
10,000 feet. They will then be flying
over the country of rugged hills of
granite, split In a thousand ways by
gulches, ravines and great canyons.
On the calmest days you can climb
from a valley where not a breath of
air is stirring and encounter a wind
on the top of the hills which would
take a strong man off his feet. The
hot air rushes up the slopes and turns
into a small hurricane when it reaches
the colder levels."
Has Lost Pursuers.
Commanders of the Carranza troops
now in the Chihuahua region appar
ently have lost trace of Villa and his
men for no report has been received
by Mexican officials here for some
time concerning Villa's whereabouts.
Armed bands of Villa forces are re
ported in various parts of Chihuahua
and in some numbers around Torreon
but they are operating independently
of the main Villa command.
Carranza officials in Juarez e^Apss
their belief that Villa will try fo es
tablish a main base at some point
after he has thrown the American
cavalry off his trail and then recruit
his command.
Villa, the Carranza officers think,
will then ongage in a marauding cam
paign that would give the American
and Carranza forces no end of trouble.:

ASSAILANTS LOSE HEAVILY
Using every advantage which the
ground afforded, the French infantry
held off the Germans with rifle and ma

curtain of shells which prevented re
serves from approaching. Again the
gray coated waves surged forward,
only to be broken against the stout re
sistance of the defenders.
The object of the Germans was to
force the French to evacuate the vil
lage of Malancourt, the heights sur
rounding which the Germans already
hold. They failed completely, It is af

court salient as firmly as ever.
In the Vosges region the artillery

Washington, D. C., March 29.—
Aeroplane manufacturers have evinced
a desire to cooperate closely with the

war planes, Secretary Baker said to
day. They have suggested a testing

new types may be tried out by army

some such plan would be adopted by

soon as possible.
UNION FIGHTING
Toledo, Ohio, March 29 —With every
street car in the city idle and working
men and woifren compelled to get to
their labor the best way they can, in
dications this morning were that no re
lief from the situation would be had in
the immediate future.
Eight hundred motormen and con
ductors quit work yesterday when told
to remove union buttons from the
lapels of'their coats or quit. Some of
the cars were left standing in the
streets.
Henry L. Doherty of New York, pres
ident of the Doherty interests, which
control the local lines, telephoned last
night that the union under no circum
stances would be recognized.
The organization of the street men's
union was effected a few days ago.
No demands of any kind had been
made by the men. The trouble is more
in the nature of a lockout, it is stated.

Cleveland, Ohio, 'March 29. —A

according to A. S. Ingalls, general
superintendent of the New York
Central. Ingalls, with L.
The second section of the Chicago
Buffalo Flyer crashed into the first sec
tion In a heavy fog when the first sec
tion stopped to take water.
The Twentieth Century, westbound,
ploughed through the wreckage of
train No. 8 which had been hurled to
the westbound track, before flagmen
could be sent out to stop it.
Train No. 86 was due at Cleveland
at 4:05 a. m.
Most of the dead were In the rear
coaches of the first section of the
Chicago-Buffalo Flyer.
Some dead were found in the rear
coaches of the second section of the
flyer, which buckled over* onto the
Twentieth Century's right of way and
were splintered by that train.
Most of the dead are said to be for
eigners who were traveling In the rear
coach of the first section of the Chi
cago-Buffalo Flyef.
There are no dead among the pas
sengers on the Twentieth Century
Limited though a number of passen
gers were badly hurt on this train.
Two coaches of the Twentieth Century
were overturned. The low casualties
on the Twentieth Century are attribuc
ed to the fact that the palace train was
proceeding slowly because of the
heavy fog.
Victims Unclothed.
The second section of the flyer was
going at a high rate of speed when it
struck the first section.
Many of the dead probably will go
to their graves unidentified.
Most of those killed were asleep in
the rear day coach of First No. 86 at
the time of
the
crash and they had re
moved wraps and coats and other arti
cles of identifying clothing.
The bodies of many of these scantily
clad victims are so horribly mangled
that identification, without the guid
ance of the clothing they wore will be
impossible.
Some of the victims were decapitat
ed. Arms, legs and portions of hu
man bodies were scattered thickly
through the wreckage.
Relief parties collected the remains
of three bodies—those of a woman and
two men—and piled them, indiscrimin
ately, in one basket. They probably
will be buried together.
Survivors Give Details.
Alfred Fritzele, Cleveland, salesman
for afire extinguisher company, was
In the Toledo sleeper of the first sec
tion and escaped injury. He helped
in the rescue and then came on to
Cleveland.
Aaron De Ray, Pittsburgh, who came
through with Fritzele, said he was cat
apulted from his berth into one oc
cupied by a woman across the ais'e
when the crash came. De Ray was un
injured.
A. Comensky, Pittsburgh, coming

II SINKING
BRITISH STEAMER
AFFIDAVITS MAKE IT CLEAR
THAT THE ENGLISHMAN TRIED
TO E8CAPE.
Washington, D. C., March 29.—The
British horse ship Englishman was
first shelled and then torpedoed by a
German submarine, according to affi
davits made to representatives of the
state department at Liverpool by three
American survivors.
Following the receipts of this infor
mation today, officials said it seemed
clear that the Englishman had tried
to escape. The submarine was oper
ating within the law In shelling and
torpedoing the Englishman, if the
vessel was fleeing to escape capture
as is inferred by officials here from
the dispatch.
The German government has been
asked whether any of its submarines
was concerned in the sinking of the
Englishman or the damaging of the
British channel steamer Sussex while
that ship was carrying twenty-five
American passengers.
While it is indicated that the case
of the Englishman may not lead to
difficulties between the United States
and Germany if it is proved she was
escaping, overnight dispatches to the
state department from Dover seem,
officials said, to bear out previous al
legations that the Sussex was tor
pedoed. American consular represen
tatives, it was said in the dispatches,
had seoured from various survivors at
Dover affidavits confirming those by
survivors in France.
The state department expects to
receive from Ambassador Gerard at
Berlin some time today or tonight the
result of his inquiry at the German
foreign office into the circumstances
surrounding the damaging of the Sus
sex and .the sinking of the English
man. Upon the information contained
in the ambassador's reply probably
will depend the next step to be taken
by the United States.
A dispatch from Dover today said
George H. Crocker, an American, is
seriously injured.
vAw3ilt
Information.
Washington, D. C., March 29.—What
will be the next step of the United
States in the latest submarine issue
probably will depend upon the nature
of the response of the German govern
ment to Inquiries Ambassador Gerard
was expected to make today. The
ambassador had been instructed to
inquire of the Berlin foreign office
whether any of the German submar
ines torpedoed the British steamers
Sussex and Englishman.
The torpedoing without warning of
the British steamer Manchester En
gineer has still further complicated
the general situation.
It was expected that Col. E. M.
House, the president's closest adviser,
who is thoroughly familiar with the
German government's views, would
again confer with the president and
state department officials today.
REPLY TO U. 8. READY.
London, March 29.—No time has as

restrictions imposed by Great Britain
on maritime commerce.
After being changed in accordance
with the desires of France, the British
draft •of the reply was again submitted
to the French cabinet and did not
prove wholly satisfactory. It is now
believed, however, a satisfactory ad
justment of the views of the two na
tions has been reached.
It is known that no concession lead
ing to declaration of an actual block
ade is made in the note, which reiter
ates the principles set forth in orders
in council and defends their applicar
tion.

WITHOUT II SHOT
Washington, D. C., March 29.
Dreadnaughts have won the greatest
victory of the European war, without
firing a shot, Assistant Secretary
Roosevelt of the navy told the house
naval committee today. With enough
dreadnaughts, he said, the United
States would win a "bloodless vic
tory" in a war.
"Today the United States is richer
and weaker than ever in its history, in
comparison with other powers," Mr.
Roosevelt said, explaining that the na
tion has great potential resources, but
a "handful of an army" and a navy
weaker than several powers for imme
diate defense.
By keeping the foe's fleet off the
seas, Mr. Roosevelt said the British
dreadnaughts had attained the aim for
which they were built.
That there is a possibility at least of
this nation becoming Involved in war
with a victor in Europe was asserted
by Mr. Roosevelt. He pictured dis
aster in a war with a fleet twice as
strong, expressing belief that the
United States fleet would be wiped
out, the Panama canal and U. S. pos
sessions lost and the nation "bottled
up" and open to invasion. ,,iV
