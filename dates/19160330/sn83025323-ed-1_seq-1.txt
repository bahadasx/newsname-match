MAYOR B. W. BROCKWAY
CROSSES GREAT DIVIDE
Malta today is mourning the loss
of her mayor. His pen is stilled.
The office chair is vacant. We look,
as we have ever looked in days gone
by, for the familiar face and seek
the word of information or of direc
tion, but the ever cheerful and ac
commodating personality is gone.
This is why our citizens are in sor
row today.
Benjamin William Brockway died
early on the morning of Monday,
1\Tarch 27th, and when the news be
came known outside of the home of
the sorrowing family, a universal re
gret was felt in all Northern Mon
tana of which the deceased had been
a devoted citizen and a costructive
builder.
Mr. Brockway, or "Brock," as
his intimate friends and companions
called him, was born in Allen, Mich.,
November 7th, 1849. He was mar
ried to Lillian Nichols in 1875, who
with one son. C. J. Brockway, and
a daughter, Mrs. Hugo Stolly, sur
vive him. In the year 1872 Mr. and
Mrs. Brockway moved from Michi
gan to Illinois, and from thence to
Iowa, in 1881, leaving the latter
state in 1899, and coming to Malta,
where for the first three years lie
worked with one of Malta's pioneer
merchants, Mr. Trafton, in the mer
coantile business. From that time
Mr. Brockway grew to be an intregal
part of the growth and development
of the city of Malta. His fathful
services in the various city and
county organizations and his long
and intimate association with the
affairs of the country's complex life
rade him a valuable leader, a safe
adviser and a most efficient officer.
He was justice of the peace in
Malta for a long time, secretary of
the Milk River Valley Water Users'
Association for the success of which
he worked with an unusual degree.
He held the secretaryship of the
Malta Cemetery association, and his
never ceasing interest in and devo
tion to the improvement as a more
fit sleeping place for the dead were
deeply appreciated everywhere. In
the office of United States Commis
sioner, which Mr. Brockwav held
for several years, his high ideals
and unremitting loyalty to duty, had
won for him a most enviable place
in the esteem of the northeastern
Montana homesteaders. His death
to them means the loss of a most
useful. ever ready and reliable help
er and informant. Nbne te'er went
aw.ay from his office without feeling
wrore confident and helpful because
of "Brock's" instructive counsel.
fTerein he will be seriously missed.
Mr. Brockway succeeded Mayor Cas
crlhurg as mayor of the city and
under his term of office, his concen
trated efforts upon the affairs of the
city, for which he had always done
much, brought for him the esteem
that makes his passing doubly
mourned by all. The funeral of Mr.
Brockway was held on Wednesday
Sfternoon at 3 o'cl'bck from the M.
E. church, the Rev. L. J. Christler
of the Milk River Valley Mission
Field, officiating. Mr. Christler had
officiated on the occasion of the
funeral of Mr. Brockway's daughter,
Ethel Brockwtay Smith, who died
more than three years ago, and it
was Mr. Brockway's request that the
Valley Mission Field clergyman lay
him to final resting place, beside
that of his daughter to whom he had
always been greatly devoted.
The church was filled to overflow
ing. Citizens of Malta, farmers
from the country, representatives
from the county and northern Mon
tana were in attendance to pay
last tribute of respect to Mr. Brock
way. The Malta lodge No. 72 of
Odd Fellows, of which fraternity the
deceased had been a member for
over 40 years, were present in a
body. The floral offerings were
many and beautiful, all bearing a
beautiful memorial record to the
memory of the deceased. The choir
rendered "Lead Kindly Light,"
"Crossing the Bar," and "Rock of
Ages." Rev. Christler read the im
pressive Episcopal church burial
office and made a brief address. The
bearers were L. C. Edwards, John
Survant. J. F. Kilduff, Harry Cosner
J. F. Murray and Lyman Barnes.
Burial was made in the Malta ceme
tery, the local lodge of Odd Fellows
ounducting their service of commit
tal.
Besides his wife, son and daugh
ter there survives Mr. Brockway's
sister, now residing in California.
Thus, another one of our citizens,
men of rare force of character, of
public service and of usefulness in
the community, leave us bowed in
sorrow. Death touched their brows
and they fell to sleep., "May light
shine upon them."

ple of, lt.a will greatly lriu.s the
electric tights in their h.o:,,:s and

the propsed shut down is tha high
price of fuel and the lack of sup
port. In the early evening the plant
has a go(od load, but after ten or
eleven Otelock there is little doing.
The city refuses to give the light
company a franchise and t(he com
pany under the conditions do not
care to invest more money in ma
chinery. It would be a nice thing
if the city officials and th' light
companly could get together and
have sotpe kind of an agroeement or
understanding whereby the lights
would be improved and the street
lights indtalled. A franchise grant
ed to the light company with the
privilege of the city taking over the
fixtures at the end of five years
would not work a hardship on any
one.
SCHOOL rECTION SATURi. DAY
Saturday, April 1st, is the date
of the annual school election and a
full attendance is earnestly request
ed. If the people of Malta who are
in the habit of registering so many
kicks against the action ot the
school bq rd would all turn out and
express t ir opinions at the annual
electionl would be much better
than to ait and holler their heads
off after few voters have electedi a
trustee. :Mr. Bates is the only cand
Sidate in the field to be voted upon I
Saturday and no better man for the
position could he selected, but the
voters should have at least pride en
ough to turn out and give him a big
vote, thereby showing that you are
placing your confidence in the new
board to ''ait.i.fully carry on the
school work.
We have one of the finest schools;
in northern :Montana and a little en

never were more effectually combined than this spring.

are among the finest delineations of the designer's art. We searched the markets
of the country to find Coats .for you that should typify Fashion's whims-that
should combine Style with Beauty, and merge both with economy. In the beauti
ful Classic coats we found what we know you will delight in seeing and take pride
