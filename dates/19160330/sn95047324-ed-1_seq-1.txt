LATE GOVERNMENT REPORT
Results of Eradication Work
in Florida, Texas, Mississippi,
Georgia and South Carolina,
Since Beginning Systematic
Fight.
Washington, D. C. A govern
ment report states that a total
area of 9,739 square miles was re
leased from quarantine on ac
count of the cattle tick on March
10. The free territory is situated
in the States of Florida, , Texas,
Mississippi, Georgia and South
Carolina, and includes the whole
or parts of 16 counties. There
have now been released from Fed
oral quarantine 284,521 square
miles of the original 728,543
which were put under quarantine
in 1906, when the work of syste
matic tick eradication was begun.
Florida Begins Fight
. A significant feature of the
new order, is that with the release
of territory in Florida there is
no tick-infested State in which
some counties have not been
made free of the pest. In Flori-
da the whole of Dade and Brow
ard counties and part of . Palm
Beach county are now tick free.
The Florida work began in 1914,
when a number of prominent
farmers, cattle owners, and busi
ness men held a meeting in the
courthouse in Miami on Novem
ber 25 and formed an organiza
tion for the extermination of the
cattle tick enrolled in the new or
ganization, which later became
known as the Stock Growers' As
sociation of Southeast Florida.
The membership fee was fixed at
$1, but voluntary contributions
aggregating $271 were obtained
in a short time. This was sup
plemented by a county appropri
ation of $500 and a campaign a
gainst the tick "was begun. A
survey of the territory showed
that there were about 850 cattle,
principally dairy cows, in the
county. The State live-stock
sanitary officials and the depart
ment were called upon for assist
ance, five dipping vats were built,
and on May 8, 1915, regular dip
ping began. By December 1,
1915, the membership in the
stockgrowers' association had in
creased to 155, the members of
the association owning between
: them nearly three-fourths of the
cattle in the county. I
From May, 1915; when, as has
been said, regular dipping began
in Dade county, until the present
time not a single cow has been
lost from tick fever and over 200

attempts to import dairy stock
had invariably resulted in failure,
for the cattle succumbed to fever.
This represented a serious loss to
Ihe community, for the large win
ter resorts along the. eastern
coast of Florida offered an excel
lent market for milk, cream, and
butter, and to obtain the maxi
mum returns from this market it
was most desirable to grade up
the native herds by the importa
tion of pure-bred stock.
Now that the tick has been
driven out from Dade and Brow
ard counties there is no reason
why this grading-up process
.should not go on rapidly. The
work of freeing these counties
from the tick has cost citizens,
county, and State about $1,600.
This sum is regarded as insignifi
cant in comparison with the in
creased - revenue which better
dairy herds will bring the com
munity. Interest in Texas
The release of Schleicher coun
ty, in the western part of Texas,
is also regarded as an encourag
ing forerunner of successful work
in that State this year. A num
ber of counties are showing their
interest in tick eradication by
making appropriations of from
$5,000 to $10,000 for the .vigorous
prosecution of the work this sea
son. It seems to be very gener
ally recognized that the most suc
cessful and most economical way
of freeing the county from ticks
is to make dipping vats readily
accessible to every part of the
county and then to insist that all
cattle be dipped regularly every
two weeks for one season. This,
'of course, requires some outlay in
the beginning, but in the end is
'far cheaper than attempts to ac-
complish the work with insuffici
ent equipment.
In the other States affected by
the-new order, Mississippi, Geor
gia and South Carolina, tick erad
ication has made great progress
in recent years. Much of South
Carolina has already been' freed,
and in both Georgia and Mississ
ippi the realization of the benefits
of the work is spreading rapidly.
Through Route Assured
Considerable interest is attach
ed by local good road enthusiasts
to the recent successful carrying
of a bond issue in the sum of
$130,000, constituting a special
road and bridge district at Punta
Gorda, and providing for the con
struction of a bridge crossing the
Peace river at that city.. In addi
tion to the. construction of the
bridge, the bond issue, which car
ried 2 to 1, provides for the con
struction of eight miles of high
way from the bridge to the Mana
tee county line, and the hard sur
facing of the present graded road
from Punta Gorda to the Lee
county line near Olga. This,
when completed, will form a
through connecting link in the
Tampa-Fort Myers highway, con
necting the Manatee county sys
tem through Bradentowu and
Sarasota.
Work is at present under way
on the completion of the Lee
county road from the Olga bridge
to the DeSoto county line, con
necting with the highway author
ized under the bond issue noted,
and it is expected that the route
when completed, will prove one of
the most important and popular
traversing the west coast. Fort

Watermelons Need Frequent Cul
tivation "
"Watermelons should not be
planted in raised hills. The hills
soon dry out below the seed and
they will not germinate. On high
land it would be better, perhaps.
to plant in a furrow. Ihe hu
not only retards germination, but
it confines the root system of the
plants when they come up.
The best watermelon land is the
Norfolk sandy loam, a fine soil
with considerable water-holding
capacity. In some places melons
are planted on flatwoods. - On
such land it may be advisable to
plant the seed in a hill to obtain
drainage.
C. K. McQuarrie, state agent
for the University of Florida Ex
tension Division, recommends f re -
quent cultivation for wntermo
ons. They should be plowed with
some shallow running tool at least
once a week until the vines cover
the ground. At the last cultiva
tion some hay crop should be
planted between the rows. A
legume is preferred, although Na
tal grass and German millet mav
be sown in South and North
Florida respectively.
Cotton Seed Meal Good for Cane
Stubble cane needs a fertilizer
high in nitrogen to give it a good
start. Cottonseed meal is recom
mended at the rate of 600 pounds
to the. acre. Stubble which has
been banked against frost should
be barred off and the crowns of
last year uncovered and hoed so
that they can sprout. Split the
middles. Fertilizer should be ap
plied before the barred furrows
are filled, and it will be ready to
use when the roots begin to grow.
Where canes are to be planted,
cut them in four or five joint
lengths. Hows should be six to
eight feet apart, according to C.
K. McQuarrie, state agent for the
University of Florida Extension
Division. Plant the Canes in fur
rows about six to eight inches
deep and lap them a little to in
sure a better stand. Canes should
be covered slightly, barely e
nough to give moisture for germi
nation. As the cane grows give
j light workings and fill the fur
row gradually, r rom 1,oimj to
2,000 three-foot canes should
plant an acre.

Coterie Punta Gordans Brand Politi
cal Announcement on a Shark
A shark, which was branded in
Sydney, Australia, eight years
ago, on the occasion of the visit
of the American battleship fleet
to that port, was hemmed up in a
tide creek near this city Friday
and labeled with the candidacy
of Albert V. Gilchrist for the U
nited States Senate.
In the Tampa (Tribune of Sun
day, there was a detailed report
of this stunt accredited to Dr. Ar
cher Smith, Dr. E. K. Whidden,
and Einmett Perkins, who were
rendered invaluable assistance by
Clayt. Porter and S. E. Johnson.
The young men were returning
from a morning's fishing when
they observed the shark, which
was a huge fellow, stranded on
the bar at the mouth of the creek.
As they approached, by a desper
ate effort the big fish floundered
over the bar and swam up the
creek only to get wedged tight
and fast in a mass of mangrove
roots at a narrow point in the
creek.
Observing an inscription that
had been burned into the side of

lia, September, 1908, American
Mulch Conserves Miosture
Do you know how much mois
ture the Florida sun and the
March wind can take out of the
soil in eight hours? C. K. Mc
Quarrie, state agent for the Uni
versity of Florida Extension Di
vision, estimates it at one inch.
One inch of rainfall is a big rain,
yet that amount may escape from
the soil every day. At that rate
it does not take long to lose the
supply of water available to
plants. The longer this evapora
tion goes on unchecked, the hard
er it will be to obtain good germi
nation of seeds.
Mr. McQuarrie has called at
tention several times to this sea
son as exceptional for the wide
spread drouth. The longer it
1 continues, the harder it will be to
1-; raise a good crop. The farmer
can avert the lack of moisture to
some extent, however, by work
ing his land well. Probably 90
per cent, of the winter and spring
plowed land lies in the rough
state until planting time. The
rougher the land; the greater the
surface that is exposed to evapor
ation. Soil should be worked im
mediately behind the plow. Use
a spike tooth harrow, a disk, a
weeder or anything that will lev
el the surface. A mulch should
bo made and maintained on top.
Do You Read the Farm Papers?
Farmers should read more
farm papers. That is the opinion
of E. S. Pace, district agent for
the University of Florida Exten
sion Division. Mr. Pace finds
that those farmers who read the
farm papers are making better
crops and are better informed on
the latest practices than those
who do not. Most agricultural
journals are edited by men who
have had practical experience in
scientific farming and who have
been connected with some kind
of experiment station and re
search work. All farm papers
advocate the same principles ad
vocated by station and extension
workers.
Furthermore, they contain
farm experience letters from suc
cessful farmers in various sec
tions of the state and country. In
Florida the local county papers
are carrying a great deal of time
ly farm news. At least seven
teen state papers are carrying ag
ricultural news in special depart
ments. Practically every county
paper runs local farm news.
The cheapest way to obtain
farm papers is in clubs. Several
good papers offer reduced rates
to a club of three to five or more.
Furthermore, by a slight addi
tion to the regular subscription
rate one may frequently obtain a
farm paper with his local county
j paper.
Fleet, in Port" Smith, Whidden
and Perkins conceived the idea of
branding a Punta Gorda adver
tisement on the opposite side of
his sharkship.
Setting about the task, they
procured the necessary imple
ments from Clayt. Porter, and
with his assistance and that of S.
E. Johnson, carried out their
plan, placing this inscription on
the shark :
"Punta Gorda, Fla., March 24,
1916 Albert W. Gilchrist for U.
S. Senator."
They' then removed from the
creek the barricade with which
they had hemmed up the shark,
and cut away the mangrove roots
in which he was held fast, let him
out on a high tide to the open sea;
and, recovering from the ordeal,
the leviation of the deep has gone
to herald it along the coasts of
Florida and elsewhere that Gil
christ is a candidate for senator.
Thus have three Punta Gorda
supporters of Governor Gilchrist
pulled off a campaign trick that
it is safe to say not one of their
favorite '8 competitors will be able
to immitate.
Many voters continue to mis
understand the effect of a second
choice vote. Under no circum
stances can a second choice vote
detract from the strength of the
voter's' first choice. It is the du-
tv of ,v,rv vntpr to rk his see-
ond choice on. his ballot when
there are three or more, candi
dates for the same office. This is
the only democratic way of evad
ing the undesirable second pri

states. The term "coming up
trom the people certainly ap
plies in his case.
Here is his record: Mayor Of
Leesburg, his home town, two
terms; Commissioner of his coun
ty ten years; chief clerk to State
Commissioner of Agriculture four
years; secretary to Internal Im
provement Board and Drainage
Committee two years; State Com
missioner of Agriculture and
State Treasurer. His elevation to
the position of Commissioner of
Agriculture came through ap
pointment of Governor Gilchrist,
who, three weeks later, induced
him to resign and accept the po
sition of Treasurer.
Mr. Luning's selection for the
last named office came in Febru
ary, 1912, and he was elected for
a full four-year term the follow
ing fall. There seems no doubt
that he will be again called to the
place he has so well filled when
the result of the 1916 balloting is
cast up.
The work of the office held by
Mr. Luning has not only kept
pace with the growth of the State
but several associated lines of
service have found their way to
special prominence. Notable a
mong these is the insurance de
partment, for some time now one
of the most important adjuncts
of the State administration. As
a consequence the last session of
the Legislature gave him an ex
pert assistant, with some new
and far-reaching laws, and the re
sult has been to bring the "insur
ance desk" more definitely than
ever to the support and attention
of the people.
J. C. Luning is of the earnest
and conscientious type of public
servant. During all the years
when duties multiplied and as
sistance remained stationary, he
kept resolutely on, studying the
needs of the. people, supplying
their wants at whatever of hard
labor and sacrifice necessary, un
til he has endeared himself to
every section, nook and corner of
his commonwealth. When the in
creased insurance . interests de
manded more and more of his
time, he not only gave it, but
studied the business that his at
tention might be of constructive
and lasting value. Consequently
he was able, when the necessity
of another law was impressed
upon the Legislature, to tell what
was needed and how the
should be applied.

No citizen can tell more of the

The State and the people arc his
