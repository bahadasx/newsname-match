(Taken from Oneida N. Y. Dispatch,)
W. Irving Tillotson, for many years
a well known architect here, died Tues
day afternoon, March 21, at the home
of his daughter, Mrs. (J. E. (Jillam, at
Niles, Mich., in his blth year. He was
born in Utica, N. Y., received his edu
cation in the public schools there, and
from the age of 18 was engaged in de
signing and erecting buildings. Today
most of Oneida's beet public and private
buildings are as a monument to his
memory. He also designed churches,
banks, colleges, etc., in other parts of
the state. Through the efforts of Mr.
Tillotson l'ark avenue was opened and
recorded as a street. He was one of
the three oldest Masons in '. Y. state.
In l'JOO Mr. TUlotson removed to
Niles, where he passed the last years of
his life, his funeral being held in Trin
ity Episcopal church uuder the direc
tion of St. Joseph Valley Lodge, l &
A. M. The body arrived at 1 :00 o'clock
today, being escorted toOlenwood cem
etery by the Oneida Lodge. While
passing, St. John's Episcopal church
bell was tolled for a long and faithful
member.
Accompanying the remains are hie
three daughters and their husbands,
Mr. and Mrs. Geo. E. Gillam, Dr. and
Mrs. V. A. Lacy and Mr.and Mrs. John
Millen who came in Mr. Millen's private
car "Grand Marais."
A very pathetic funeral service was
conducted at the home of Harvey Cope,
evuth and west of Yale, on Wednesday
afternoon of this week by He v. Wal
drm Geach, when Mrs. George Miloff
and an infant baby, both in one casket,
were laid to rest.
Sarah Isabelie Cope, daughter of
Henry A. and Mary Jane Cope, was
bom on the old Cope homestead in Em
mett township, Sept. Uth, 1879. Less
than a year ago she was united in mar
riage to George Miloff of Detroit. She
died in Detroit Saturday, March 25
She leaves a husband, father, four
brothers, four sisters and many friends
to mourn her loss.
She was a member of the Tabernacle
M. E. church, Detroit.
The fact that her sister-in-law (Har
vey ;Cope's wife) having died under
similar circumstances, and the funeral
held at the same home less than three
weeks since, makes the death all the
more mournful. ,
Mr. Cope, father of the deceased
whose home is in Texas, was not able
to attend.
The husband and family have the
sympathy of all their many friends.
.
John Sischo, aged 82, died at his
home in Yale Wednesday evening,
March 2'J. The funeral will be held
from the house Saturday morning at
11:00 o'clock. Interment in Speaker
cemetery.
Mill Creek on Rampage.
The warm weather and rains of the
past week has melted the snow and Ice
and has started the water to such an
extent as to overflow the banks of
Mill creek, the bottom lands being
flooded and the main channel a mill
race. The water was so high in the
city park that it washed over the
cement sidewalk leading to the ceme
tery and twenty-one blocks of the walk
were undermined, letting them drop
a foot or more. We hear of no other
damage at present writing.
Nine and twelve years ago this spring
we had Just such floods, but the water
in the creek is even higher at this time
than then.
It will be remembered by many of
our citizens the accident that happened
to Robert Eilar twelve years ago while
driving along the road just west of the
bridge, he was swept into deep water
and his team and buggy carried down
8 1 ream. Only for prompt aisistance
Mr. Ellar and the horses would have
perished in the ice cold water.

Work of County Agriculturist
With the exception of one day, the
entire week ending March 25th was
spent iii' tiie r thee. The time was large
ly taken up with correspondence, the
arrangement or letter and bulletin Ules,
the writing of articles tor county pap
f rs, and preparations for meetings and
demonstrations to be lield later in the
season.
On Friday, a trip was made to Ken
ockee township with a view to assist
ing with the organization of boys' and
girls' clubs. Mr. Snyder, of the Avoca
school, had requested help along tins
line, and while in the vicinity a call wast
made at the Gillis school, district rso.
3, where club work was explained.
lioya and girls clubs represent a deti
nite line of extension work carried on
by the State and National Departments
ot Agriculture lor Uie purpose or assist
ing with the training or the boys and
girls and in creating a proper attitude
toward affairs on the farm and in the
home. There are now over tfUO.OOO of
these young people enrolled in the
United Mates, and interest in the un
dertaking over the state and country is
growing very rapidly. Any boy or girl
who desires to do so can take up the
work singly, but it is desired whenever
possible to organize clubs of at least
six members. The plan isto have eah
one take up some delinite project and
carry it to completion, keeping an ac
curate record of all operations, costs,
and labor. Au account of how the
work has been accomplished together
with the records are submitted in the
fall to the State leader of Club Work
and prizes are offered usually both
locally and by the State. It is planned
to have these consist of some form of
reward which will be most helpful to
the young person, 6uch as a scholarship
at the Agricultural College, trips to
fairs, savings bank accounts, etc.
The different ages are divided into
two classes. Class A includes all boys
and girls between the ages of ten and
fourteen years, and Class U those be
tween the ages of Ufteen and eighteen
years of age, inclusive. Almost any
liue of work can be taken up that is
desired including the growing of beans,
corn, potatoes, apples, live stock, poul
try, and vegetables uy tne boys, and
the following lines of work for the
girls: housekeeping, garment-making,
canning and marketing, gardening and
canning, poultry, and market garden
ing. The County AgenC will be glad to
assist any community in getting this
work started, but in order to make it a
success, it is necessary for some adult
person to act as local leader and assist
in directing and encouraging the young
people. This leader may be the teacher
or some parent, in the neighborhood.
In fact, it is almost necessary to have
the cooperation of both, as the teacher
usually leaves the district when school
closes in June. Not only is local adult
leadership necessary, but the coopera
tion and good will of the parents of all
the children engaged in the work is
imperative, and unless this is secured,
there is very little use in trying to pro
mote the project.

S. S. Election of Officers.
The annual election of oflicers for
the Presbyterian Sunday School held
last Sunday resulted as follows!
Superintendent Glenn Daykin
Ass't Supt. James Wallace
Secretary Marjorie Menzies
Ass't Sec Harold Uallman
Treasurer Elizabeth Lothian
Pianist Mildred Kuh
It is with deep regret that each mem
ber of this school parts with the super
intendent who has for seven years
acted in this capacity so faithfully aud
so eHiciently. Probably nothing but
his removal from our city, would have
forced his people to accept a resignation
from James Beavis. He has become
so a patt of the work of the Sunday
school and has so endeared himself to
all with his always pleasant, affable
manner, his ever ready solution of any
diOiculty, his faithfulness, that it will
be a wrench all around to separate the
Presbyterian Sunday school and Super
intendent Beavis, and though with all
the good will in the world each mem
ber will wish him God Speed, wherever
he may go, yet all wish there was not
the necessity.
The new head of the school, Mr. Day
kin, is a comparatively new comer to
our city, but it doesn't take long to de
termine the standing of a man of Mr.
Daykin's calibre and the choice of one
to nil the superintendent's oflice, made
vacant by Mr. Beavis, fell on the right
shoulders. Mr. Daykin has been iden
tified with church and Sunday school
work a good many years in other places
and the work here will undoubtedly go
on as successfully as ever.
Back From the Sunny South.
Mr. and Mrs. John H. Holmes, who
have been spending the winter at
Brunswick, Ga., and Jacksonville, Fla.,
have returned to Michigan and are at
the home of Mrs. Henry Holmes in
Yale. On their way home they stop
ped at Baltimore, Md., and heard Billy
Sunday. The next morning the Sun
published a group picture of Mr. and
Mrs. Holmes and Clara Walters, who
was with them on the trip. John says
that he enjoyed the time spent In the
south but "Michigan, My Michigan,"
is good enough for him.
Notice The ladies of the Presbyter
Ian church want tour rags, both woolen
and cotton and would appreciate It if
those who have them would kindly
phone Mrs. Pollock, Mrs. Menzies or
Mrs. Wallace, The rags to be called
for about the middle of next week.
