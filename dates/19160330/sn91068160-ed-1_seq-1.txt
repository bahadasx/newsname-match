. Have Been Heard. Interesting Case.
(By ,W. T. Bost in Greensboro News.)
Raleigh, March 2.-Chief Justice
Walter Clark on a judicial high horsa
today sharply dissents from the Su-
J preme court's decision upholding
i Judge Webb in the famous Blue Ridge
! Interurban railway against the Hen
! defsbnville Light and Power, company
I End Justice W. R. Allen sharply ca.
him down.
j The court reverses itself only in its
attitude toward the facts which have
been heard. The issues are interest
irg and involve the ownership of a
stream which the Blue Ridge Interur-
ban condemned in an effort to gain
control .of. the water power
The law
permits condemnation by an interur
ban railway, but not by a resident wa
ter company. The interurban and the
Hendersonville company claimed di
vided interests. The interurban, ac
cording to the evidence offered the
light and power company $1,000 for
its interests and the local company
testified that it offered $40,000 to the
I interurban for its half interest.
i The case went to trial and Judge
Webb charged the jury that there was
no evidence that the local company
could develop the enterprise and sub
mitted the sole is3Ue of damages. The
local company had -aid that it had a
method of using half the stream to "be
deflected in a certain direction upon
its own property. The court held that
. this is unlawful and therefore the issue
of fact was not tried.
Originally about five" opinions were
written. Three, Justices Brown, Hoke
and Chief Justice Clark held against
Judge Webb, their opinion being based
upon the mixed nature of fact and lav,
Jfif.tices Walker and Allen dissented.
The interurban received a rehearing
and today won when Judge Brown con
cluded that-there was no evidence unon
vhirfi tn e-o tn' tht inrv The law re
mains and each retains his view of the
. legality.
The case has more history than this.
When. Chief . Justice Clark wrote his
original opinion he likened the conduct
. of the big companjr to that celebrated
interview .of . .Nathan and David: in
which Nathan, handed the man alter
God's own heart about as -.warm are-
tort as David has heart."Thou art th;
man' . Judge. Glark said, likening the
conduct of the Interurban in its desire
'to gain the water power to David's
stealing Uriah's wife, and David's so
cial faux pas to the rich man's theft
of the poor man's ewe lamb.
The historian of those events has it
that Charley Tillett, from Charlotte,
representing the Interurban, came
down here and told Judge Clark a few
things, one of which vas that what the
jvdge said was not true. Judge Clark
raked the Dukes then and does so
again today, He revised his old opin
iiu and left out "Thou art the man,"
Ke inserts it today and prints tho
wfcole parable, minus the direct words
of Nathan.
The chief justice narrates the Story
of Frederick the Great, who, taking all
the lands about for a little lark; balked
when a miller refused to sell. To
those who advised the confiscation of
the property, the great and arbitrary
Prussian said: "Let the miller keep
his mill that it may be known there is
a law In Prussia." The rustic mill
still stands at Potsdam.
. No Evidence, But "
Justice Allen gets right after Judge
Clark whether intentionally so or not.

wculd - warrant the charge that th
plaintiff is a trust or that it is owned
by the; Southern Power Company or by
the Dukes, but if these fa,cts appeared?
the: would not justify us in denying
to it the recognition of its property
rights5: V "
- The; shyness of evidence that 'the
Dukes own this jwaterpower has been
apparent, to everybody who read Judga
Clark's I' opinion originally, and that
shyness is increased by the turn of
things, v. Judge Clark calls names
thought ' "It appears . that, both the
president, the secretary and the treas
urer of the plaintiff company are di
rectors in the Northern and Piedpont
R. R. company, which the latter in his
testimony, states is known as the
'Duke Rpad.' rit is common knowledge
that the; Southern Power company, one
of the companies reported by the gov
ernment as engrossing the water pow
er, of this state, is controlled by the
same. Interests."
The fact that the court disagrees as
to facts.can be accounted for in the
different views as to the Duke Koaa
Judge Allen cites the evidence which t
John A. Law gave, Mr. Law declaring
that the same interests own the con
trolling stock in the piedmont ana
Northern and- the Southern Power.
He had heard that road called the
Dukes Road. -
"If, however, the plaintiff is a trust,
Judge ' Allen , continues, "the- fact is
vith t he general assembly which
granted to if its charter and from
which is' derives all its powers. It is
not claimed . that these powers have
been exceeded, and if this can be shown
it ought to be pointed but in order that
the state may take steps to have the
charter forfeited." . .
Judge Allen then argues that the
sole question is one of condemnation
and the right to go to the jury. Ho
declares that the only, evidence tend
ing to show the possibility .of develop
ment by the local company was its tes
timony that it could run a dam to the
middle of the stream and deflecting the
current, haif-of it could use it. Judge
Allen cites Angell !bn water courses ,
section 100, showing jthat. whereyer a
ateirsWe .'arHaonf .two-restates,
the riDarian. owners of . neither with-
carry off any part of that stream with
out the consent ot. the other interest.
I f It rere. otherwise litigation would
be endless.
' , Is Also Classical.
Judge Allen also is classical. After
declaring that the general assembly
and not the courts .have made the dis
tinction between the powers and rights
granted to the plaintiffs and defend
ants the plaintiffs being the Interurban
and the defendants the Hendersonville
company, the supreme court must obey,
"not thwart, its will.
"It would seem, Judge Allen says in
conclusion, "that the defendant who is
represented as a 'poor man' with 'one
little ewe lamb' (one-half,of a water
power on one side of a stream) ought
to be greatful that if saved the payment
of $40,000 for another 'little ewe lamb'
(one-half of the stream on. the oppo
site side) of the same size and weight
and kindred, which the jury has found
was only , worth $10,000.
"It will be remembered that Nathan
was dealing in a figure of speech when
ho was . talking to David and that
David's anger was greatly kindled
against the rich man and that Nathan
said to David 'Thou art the man.' "
Judge Allen does not enlighten either
the court or the world on what he
thinks Judge Clark was "dealing."

One of the most recent tickets pick-

that if the right support is shown them
several of these gentlemen will . take
the matter serious. They are every

"Josh" came near getting the nomina

LOCAL ? COMPANY
PASS INSPEC1 ION
Captain Grieg and Col. Stringfield Find
Sixth Company in Excellent Shape.
Captain A. Grieg, U. S. A., and Col.
Thomas Stringfield of the State militia
inspected the 6th company Coast or
tillery at the armory last Friday night.
Fifty out of the entire sixty-five mem
bers of the company were present in
cluding all the officers. The inspect
ing officers put the .company through
all the tests and drills and it is said
that the local boys will receive a . very
high mark. "
During the afternoon an inspection
oi the government property was made.
The property included many thousands
of dollars worth of very valuable in
struments and arms. There Is consid
erable more learning necessary for a
member of an artillery than to be a
member of an infantry company. The
artillery' men are required to know all
the drills of the infantry and in addi
tion to know how to man the big mor
tars and seige guns of the coast forts
and defense works.
The officers of the local company
are required to stand a series of three
very rigid examinations before they
are commissioned. It is said to take
constant studying on the part of the
officers on account of new rulings be
ing made from time to time by the 1
army department in the improvements
of thevsystem.
