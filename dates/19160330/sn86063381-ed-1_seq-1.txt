BEMIDJI, MDTJIESOTA, THUS8DAY EVENING, MARCH 30, 1916.
INTERVENTION
IN MEXICO MUST
COME SAYS RAILEY
Former Bemidji Man Writes From
Deming, New Mexico, of
Conditions.
LONGER POSTPONE!) THE
LONGER THE WAR IS BELIEF
Has Farm Thirty Miles From Colum
bus Where the Raid Took
Place.
That the Mexican situation is se
rious and that intervention in Mexi
can affairs is necessary is the opinion
of O. E. Bailey, formerly of this city,
now of Deming, N. M., in letters to
his mother, Mrs. H. W. Bailey.
The letter in part reads:
Situation Serious.
"While I am not afraid nor alarm
ed over the situation in Mexico yet
the situation is serious, especially
with such pjoor exeuse of a presi
dent. It may be that no war with
Mexico will come now but men who
have lived across the border and who
are acquainted with Mexican charac
ter all agree that intervention must
come and when it comes it will mean
war.
Wait Means Loss.
"The longer intervention is post
poned, the more men we will lose
We have only a few thousand sol
diers in Mexico, 120 to 150 miles
.south or Columbus, in a mountain
ous country with a great stretch of
desert between them and their base
"Villa has^more followers and sym
pathizers than the 'wise ones in
Washington' imagine and even the
soldiers of Carranza hate the heart
of a 'gringo Should Villa get some
of our men cut off it is more than
likely that the Carranza followers
would join him in a general massacre
of the American troops. And then
the thing would be 'on' in earnest.
Unprepared for Conflict.
Our country is wholly unprepared
to enter any sort of a conflict. But
ftm fn fftVorof
Michigan Minnesota Missouri
^etttnfe ready *tty-
way."
In a letter to his son and daughter
who are visiting their grandmother,
he writes:
"One report today is that a large
force of Carranza, troops has joined
Villa, which is not at all surprising.
The general opinion here and at El
Paso is that sooner or later we will
have all of Mexico to fight and whip."
BEMIDJI NAVAL
MILITIA WILL GO
ON SEA CRUISE
Orders will be issued from the navy
department in Washington within
the next few days announcing the
most comprehensive training plan the
department has yet devised for the
naval militia of the various states.
In the middle of August every avail
able man in the service in the in
terior states will be brought east and
given his two weeks' cruise aboard
a battleship.
The experiment was tried out on a
small scale last year, when detach
ments from Wisconsin and Missouri
were allowed to get their training in
salt air instead of cruising on the
Great Lakes or the Mississippi river.
It was so successful that the de
partment decide* to make it an an
nual affair in every way, which every
man in the service could participate.
Following are the numbers of offi
cers and men affected:
State Officers

Total 152 1,913
It is proposed that on the cruise
the ships will be manned with 40 per
cent veteran tars from the regular
service and 60 per cent militiamen.
The plan for a "salt" cruise has
aroused much interest among the
members of the Bemidji naval militia.
