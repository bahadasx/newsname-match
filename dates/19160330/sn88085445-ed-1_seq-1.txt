Cartoonist To Lecture Friday
The first number of the Socialist
lecture course was given Fiiday by
George Kirkpatrick and the sec
ond number will be Friday night ft
the Electric Theater by Ryan
Walker, who will deliver a lecture
and Illustrate it with cartoons that
he will draw on the stage.
There was a good crowd pnr.lt
to hear Mr. • Kirkpatrick, one of
the leading Socialists of the coun
try, and the nominee of his party
for vice-president. The speaker
spoke on the subject of the present
war, and gave lto causes and the
cure for all wars from the stand
point of tho Socialist philosophy.
The lecture Friday night will be
attractive, since all cattoonlsis on
the stage are a wonder to the or
dinary person. His lecture will be
entitled, "The New Adventures of
Henry Dubb " Walker is without
a single exception the most unique
speaker on the American Socialist
platform*and he is due to receive
an enthusiastic reception upon his
appearance here.
Mrs. W. B. S.huyleman celebrat
ed her 65tu bl ir.day Tuesday. All
her chlldien and grandchildren
gathered at her homo and spent a
pleasant day.
LA FOLLETTE has driven the American flag from the seas. That was
because public opinion did not stir itself and therefore was not
' powerful enough to defeat the suicidal measure.
And we have been negligeut of the most important feature of Ameri
can commerce. Freight rates have gone up ten times in the last eight
months. New York is in a congested condition, and bo is Boston.
Fifty millions of dollars was paid by European powers in subsidies,
while this great country in 1913 paid only $1,433,000. National defense
and the mercantile marine are really the least considered topics before
the American people. WE DO THINGS BY COMPULSION, BY
INSURRECTION AND BECAUSE WE ARE FORCED TO DO
THEM.
I'am for the honor and dignity of that old flag being on the water
ways of the world and am sufficiently on optimist to believe that the old
flag is coming back to those waterways.
I ALBO BELIEVE THAT THAT GREATEBT FORCE —CONCENTRATED
PUBLIC OPINION—WILL. COME FORTH, AND CONGRESS WILL BE
COMPELLED TO ACCEPT DICTATION FROM THAT FORCE.
Mv opinion is that the Monroe doctrine will prove the salvation of
the Americans long before your lifetime or mine is orer. There are tht
nations over the other side of the Atlantic battling in all their fury
They will be bunkrupt, but in possession of gTeat fighting units. Will
they not perlwps look with greed upon the republics of this continent:
Then Americans of the north and south will realize that in combination
there is salvation. _ » -
