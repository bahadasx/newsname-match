Bitterness Created by Recent German
Air Raid on Saloniki.
Athens, Greece, March 28, via Paris,
March 29, 2.30 p. m. The aerial bom

hnds expression in bitter editorials in
the liberal press against the continued
neutrality of Greece.
The question of declaration of mar
tial law was again raised in ah excit
ing session of the chamber of deputie3

(sovernment discouraged all hostile
comment on . actions of Germans, and
Premier ! Skoulouflia declined to con -tinue
a debate involving discussion of
foreign relations because. ,the highest
interests impose silence."
Notwithstanding the attitude of the
government, the Saloniki raid was
characterized in the chamber as "sim
ply assassination" and as "German
frightfulness" designed to intimidate
the Greeks.
Plans were made to hold mass meet
ings at Saloniki, but the government
has forbidden them.

LOOK. rf MAN WHO
MBALMED PECK'S BODY.
Waits Claims He Gave Him $18,400 to
Swear He Used Arsenic.
New York, March 29. District At
torney Edward Swann centered his ef
forts tonight on finding Eugeue Oliver
JCane, who embalmed the body of John
E. Peck, wealthy Grand Rapids drug
gist, for whose murder his son-in-law,
Dr. Arthur "Warren Waite, is under ar
rest here. Kane's arrest has been or
dered on the charge of conspiracy to
commit a crime.
Waite is said by Mr. Swann to have
declared that Kane accepted $9,000 in
cash and a check for $9,400 as part
payment of $25,000 he was to be paid
for swearing that he used arseric in
embalming Peck's body. This arrange
ment, Waite said, according to the
district attorney, was made after an
autopsy on Peck's body disclosed the
presence of a large quantity of arsenic.
Waite, In statements made to the dis
trict attorney and others, is se.id to
have confessed not only to poisoning
Peck, but placing germs of virulent
diseases in the food of Mrs Peck, who
died at Waite's apartment six weeks
before her husband.
John S. Potter, the undertaker wht.
had charge of Peck's funeral and who
employed Kane as embalmer, was ex
amined this afternoon and tonight at
the ' district attorney's office. Potter
reflterated denials that he had any
part in the alleged negotiations be
tween Kane and Waite, except to send
Kane to the dentist s apartment when
Waite desired to know the formula
of the embalming fluid used on Peck s
body. He did admit, however, that he
received a letter from Waite asking
him and Kane not to telephone him.
as Waite believed his telephone wire
had been "tapped," and also telling
him he need not worry about his
check.

cny serious opposition to the bill as
a whole, though changes in certain
teatures will be advocated. Senator

the creation and the training of a vol
unteer force under supervision of fed-
tral army officers.
The chief aim of the senate substi
tute is to increase the peace strength of

CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE IM
PLICATES GERMANY'S BOATS
IN SINKING OF SHIPS
Every Agency Open to the State De
partment is Actively Engaged in
Gathering Facts About Recent Sink
ing of Ships in English Channel.
Washington. March 29. The accu
mulation of circumstantial evidence
indicating that Germany has engaged
upon a caifpaign of submarine war
fare which has no regnrds for the
rights of American citjis traveling
on merchant ships of 'belligerent na
tionality, the administration considers.
has created one of the most serious
situations which has confronted the
United States since the heginning of
the war in Europe.
Gathering Facts.
Every "agency open to the state de
partment tonight was being employed
in an effort to gather an unimpeach
able array of facts regarding the ex
plosion which damaged the British
channel steamer Sussex; the sinking
of the British ships Manchester En
gineer. Englishman and Lagle Point
and the allt ged firing of a torpedo at
a French passenger ship Patrio.
Ships Carried Americans.
All these ships carried American clt
izens and all apparently were attacked
in violation of Germany s recently re
newed assurances to the United States.
The next step of the United States is
said authoritatively to have been de
termined upon. Unless Germany in
reply to the inquiries made by the
United States through Ambassador
Gerard, makes some statement to
cause the state department to change
its present intentions, it is understood
that all the recent aggravating inci
dents will be combined into one gen
eral formidable indictment which will
bring the entire subject to a clear-cut
issue.
Must Punish Submarine Commander.
Should Germany admit responsibil
ity for any of the attacks and attempt
to satisfy the united States by say
ing that a mistake had been made and
by offering to make reparation and to
punifch the submarine commander, the
Issue would not by any means be dis
posed of. It is regarded as certain
that the United States would not ac
cept such an explanation as satisfac
tory, at least until time had shown
what punishment actually was meted
oit to the offending submarine com
mander and whether any value longe
could be attached to Germany prom
ises.
Action Framed, but Not Disclosed.
In the event of Germany disclaim
ing responsibility for the disasters, the
United States will proceed with its in
vestigations to determine to its satis
faction to determine whether the evi
dence which strongly indicates tha'
the Sussex and other ships wede tor
pedoed without warning, can be re
garded as conclusive proof. With such
proof before it, the -government psob
ably would act promptly. Officials re
frain from discussing what the nature
of the action would be.

GARRANZA GRANTS USE OF RAILROADS
One of the Army's Most Serious Problems in Hunting
Francisco Villa
ARMY MAY USE ROADS
Carranza Kecelveu Request Yesterday Morning and His An
swer Was in Washington Before Dark War Depart
ment Officials Greatly Relieved by the Removal of the
Necessity of Maintaining a Motor Truck Supply Line
Over Desert Road Details of the Protocol Remain to
be Worked Out Through Diplomatic Channels.
Washington. March 29. One of the
array's most serious problems in
hunting Villa was solved today when
General Carranza promptly granted
the renewed request of the state de
partment ior permission to use the
Mexican Northwestern railroad in car
rying out the pursuit.
Carranza's Answer Wss Prompt.
General Carranzi received the new
request this morning; his answer was
in Washington before dark. It was
contained in a brief message from
John L. Rodgers, special agent of the
i-niiea oiaies at Uueretaro. saying the
head of de facto government agreed
to the commercial use of the line. Of
ficials here assumr he would be equal
ly prompt in notifying his officers on
the border and that General Funston
mignt begin shipment tomorrow.
Pay Commercial Rates.
Although the army will proceed to
use the railroad on a commercial
basis, which is construed here as
meaning that all service aha 11 tw ra.
for at regular rates, the state depart
ment will negotiate further with Car
ranza to bring about a snore complete
understanding as to just what he has
agreea to. Today's response is re-

measure, but It is not suiHcientlv defl

assure the arrival and deliverv of aim.

General Funston will desire to place

plies at the border."
While the physical condition of the
Mexican Northwestern is not good
many bridges having been destroyed
during the years of revolution in Mex
ico, army engineers should have little
difficulty in keeping it open.
Details of Protocol to be Worked Out.
Aside from the railroad problem,
details of the protocol suggested by
General Carranza remain to be worked
out through diplomatic channels. State
department oincials indicate, however,
that there is no reason for haste in
this conenction. As was the case when
American troops crossed into Mexico
in pursuit of Geronimo. the Aoache
outlaw, years ago. the formal agree
ment may not be completed until the
expedition has accomplished its pur
pose and returned. It will serve, how
ever, as the legal basis for the adjust
ment of all claims arising out of the
use of American troops to pursue Villa.
In Mexico the agreement is under
stood to have another object. Genrral
Carranza is said to desire its perfec
tion as a definite and binding under
standing with the United Staf-s
which he can show to his people in
support of his statement that no sov
ereign right of his country has been
surrendered or violated.
No Military News From the Border.
There was no military news today
from the border or from the expedi
tionary columns. General Pershing's
reports to General Funston have bwn
very brief and it has been only the
important despatches from the front
that have been forwarded to the war
department. Officials viewed with
satisfaction, however, press reports
saying that American troopers were
pressing close on the bandit's heels.
No olficer. here would hazard an
opinion as to how long the rhae
mi-ht take. Lacking knowledge of the
local conditions or of General l'er
shinT's plans, they said it was im
possible to predict when or where it
might end.
Medical officers were inclined to
discredit reports of extensive sickres
among the troops at the front. The
region In which they are operating Is
described ns healthful and the men of
the expeditionary force are thoroughly
acclimated. No reports of casualties
or epidemics have been received be
yond the terse messages today saying
that a trooper of the Tenth Cavalry
had died as a result or lnujries re
ceived In a train wreck.
General Funston has not asked for
any extension of his base hospital fa
cilities. Plans for addition wards for
the hospital at Fort Bliss have been
prepared for some time, but the work
has not been authorized. It was Fai J
remodeling of barracks at the fort
might be in progress during the ab
sence of troops. This might have led,
officers said, to reports it was being
enlarged. Nothing has been heard
here of a heavy movement of sick or
Injured men to Fort Bliss.
Quiet in All Districts.
A state department summary of
despatches today reported quiet in all
districts heard from. There are
twenty Americans in Durango and ten
more in the outlying districts of that
region.
"All are reported to be well," the
statement said. There are eighteen
Americans In the Ealtillo district where
railway communication Is opn In all
directions and a big radio plant in op
era tion.
"General Ttevlno returned to Tor
reon on March 2." the statement
added, "and It la reported he will In
"titute an energetlo campaign against
the lawless element In the Lag una re
ron."

The limitations imposed by General
Carranza. confining shipments to goods
sent to concerns in Mexico who have
contracts with the expeditionary force,
caused some disappointment among
army officers. Tt was feared that these
restrictions, coupled wit hthe fact that
military guards could not accompxX
the trains, might serious'v hamper the
transmission of an adequate stream of
supplies.
The Northwestern lines between
here and Cnsns Grandes. near which
town General Pershing has established
his principal bas in Mexico, are ad.
mittedly bad. Almost all the brliges
which spanned the numerous gulches
between thes two towns have been
burned by brigands who have roved
through the country during the last
two years. These bridges have not
been repaired, but temporary tracks
havo been laid on Improvised roadbeds

REJOICING AT GENERAL
FUNSTON'S HEACQUARTERS
Over News That Supplies Can Be
Shipped Over Mexican Railroads.
San Antonio. Tex, March 29. Gen
eral Carranza's permission to ship sup
p ies over the Mexican Northwestern
railroad to the American troops in
Mexico was received at General Fun
ton's headquarters with rejoicing, but
is manifestation of pleasure was
tampered by the news that the sup
plies must be consigned as ordinary
freight to seme individual not oon
t ected with the army.
Late today General Funston had not
received official notification that he
was at liberty to ship supplies through
Juarez to Cisas Grandes. but orders
already issued to the commissary de
partment were such that no delav waa
expected. It was said that within a
few hours the stores that te quarter
master's department had been accu
mulating at El Paso could be billed to
points along the Northwestern, once)
the official sanction was given.
The position taken by the advance
forces of General Pershing mide some
new touring or supplies absolutely
necessary and Carranza's permission
to use the railroad for the transporta
tion of supplies was welcomed as relief
even though bearing the handicap of
tne conditions -snip as commercial
freight."
