DESTRUCTIVE FIRE
AT LEXINGTON.
TBRIVING TOWN PRACTICALLY
WIPED OCT BY FLAMES-LOSS
ESTIMATED AT S160.000.
. A special dispatch to the News
and Courier Tuesday morning from
Lexington states:
Practically the whole town of
Lexington was destroyed by a fire,
which started at 10:40 o'clock last
* * % a- J J
night, aomg an esumaieu uamu^c
of $160,000, wiping out every business
house in town except the
Caughman-Kaminer Company, the
Harmon Drug Company and Meetze
f & Son. The Home National Bank,
on the corner of Main and Depot
streets; the court house and the
county jail were also saved by heroic
efforts.
The fire'originated in the store of
the Sawyer Drug Company and was
quickly swept by a northwest wind
to adjoining buildings on each side.
The following buildings were consumed:
Scott Hendrix, two stores;
gjf. the old W P Roof building, which
was unoccupied, except by a barber
shop; Mitchell's meat market, a
small shoe repairing establishment,
Barley Barre Hardware Company,
E B Roof & Sons, Andrew J Mathias,
Sawyer Drug Company, E G Dreher,
Enterprise Hardware Company, Sarratt's
Bazaar and the Lexington
Dispatch. The Bank for Western
Carolina went up in the flames, as
did the building of Alfred J Fox, in
which was located a pool room and
barber shop. Meetze Hotel and the
Citizens' Telephone Company's building
were consumed.
The Caughman-Kaminer Company
was saved only by the most heroic
efforts. In attempting to save this
building Capt Chas H Kelso, of
Cleveland, Ohio, who is spending
vthe winter in Lexington, became
overheated and had to be carried
away in a fainting condition. He
recovered, however, and resumed
the fight. Others were more or less
injured, but none seriously.
The Columbia fire department was
called upon for aid and responded
promptly, but on account of lack
of water supply the firemen were
powerless to lend assistance.
The town is practically wiped out
and everybody is more or less ex|
cited.
Mr. Evans "Making Good."
Blenheim, March 29:?S E Evans,
* _i a.?*f?11
iarm aemousiraiui ui luarmuru
county, is doing a good work in aiding
the farmers in selecting seed,
pruning and plantingfruit trees and
in the organization of corn and pig
clubs. Very little attention has been
paid to fruit growing in this county,
though the soil is in many localities
\ we?l adapted to the growth of pears
\ and peaches. The once prevalent
"piney woods rooter" is rapidly be*
ing supplanted by swine of better
breed, among which the Duroc Jersey
seems to be a popular specimen.
Mr Evans seems to have his work
well in hand, and his aid and advice
are a valuable asset to the agricultural
assets of the county.?News
Courier.
Mr Evans is a native of Workman
and a graduate of Kingstree High
school and Clemson college. We are
