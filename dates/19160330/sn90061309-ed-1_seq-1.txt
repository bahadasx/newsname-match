A Delightful Musical Program
The Oman Recital at the First
Baptist Church Thursday evening
was well attended and every one
was well pleased with the program
rendered. Mr. W. S Johnson of
Quincy is a natural musician and
thoroughly understands an organ
and was able to show just what
could be done with this one. The
members of the '-'ir.-t Baptist
Church have a splendid organ and
are justly proud of it.
As announced last week Mr
Johnson was assisted by Misses
Berlha Jaeger. Lucilc Proctor and
Merle Tooley. Th'se are favorites
with the music loving people of
Monroe and their selecti ins were
very much enj-iyed.
