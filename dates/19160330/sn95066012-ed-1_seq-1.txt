Administration Will Seek More Com
plete Understanding with Head of
DeFacto Government.
El Paso, Tex., March 30. According
to reports received here Villa has been
located at Santa Thomas, 60 mil?3
, southeast of Madera. If the report is
correct, the American troops, who are
now 300 miles south of the border, are
on Villa's heels. Col. . Dodd's com
mand was reported to be at Madera
two days ago.
Washington, March 30. One of the
army's most serious problems in hunt
ing Villa was solved yesterday when
Gen. Carranza promptly granted the
renewed request of the state depart
ment for permission to use the Mexi
can Northwestern railroad in carrying
out the pursuit Gen Carrauza receiv
ed the new request yesterday morn
ing; his answer was in Washington be
fore dark. It was contained in a brief
message from Joim L. Rogers, special
agent of the United States at Quere
taro, saying the head of the de facto
government agreed to the commercial
use of the line. Officials in Washing
ton assumed he would be equally
prompt in notifying his officers on the
border and that Gen Funston might be
gin shipment today.
'Although the army, will proceed to
use the railroad on a commercial basis
which is construed as meaning that all
service shall be paid for at regular
rates, the state department will nego
tiate further with Carranza to bring
about a more complete understanding
as to just what he has agreed to. Yes
terday's response- is regarded as being
' satisfactory in a measure, but it is not
sufficiently definite. It may be, too,
that liTorder to' assure the -arrival and
delivery of supplies shipped to points
along the line Gen Funston will desire
to place guards on the trains.
While the physical condition of the
Mexican Northwestern is not good,
many bridges having been destroyed
during the years of revolution in Mex
ico, army engineers should have lit
tle difficulty in keeping it open.
There was no military news yester
day from the border or from the expe
ditionary columns. Gen Pershing's re
ports to Gen Funston have been very
brief and it has been only the impor
tant dispatches from the front that
have been forwarded to the war de
partment. Officials viewed with satis
faction, however, press reports saying
that American troopers were pressing
close on the bandit's heels.
ERRANT HUSBAND A SUICIDE
G. P. Everett of Towson, Md Killed
Himself In the Phillipines.
Baltimore, March 27. Residents of
Towson heard today of a dramatic se
quel to the marriage of Miss Edith
Harris and George P. Everett on Oct.,
12, 1914, and the disappearance of the
bridegroom two days after . the wed
ding. Everett made an engagement to
meet his wife down town, but failed to
keep it.. The wife has been in abso
lute ignorance of his whereabouts
since. She has been informed that he
committed suicide in the Phillipine Is
lands on Feb. 6. He had enlisted In
the United States Army, in which he
was private at the time of his death.
Until this message arrived the wife
had not the remotest idea of what had
become of her husband. For weeks
after he left her she was ill at her
home in Towson. She is now living
at 506 West 130th street, New York.

eCORES ADMINISTRATION
Rooseve. " $(' Wilson Policies Have
Disb e " the Countrj
Oyster Bay, ...Mareh 29. In a
bitter denunciation ,''', sident Wil
son, which he made ' ;i. tonight,
Colonel Theodore Roosevut charged
that by the policies adopted in treat
ing with Mexico, preparedness, and
the European war, the Administration
had placed this country in an infamous
position and had courted the "possibili
ty of the most terrible disgrace and
disaster in the future."
Taking as his text what he termed
the President's "utterly baseless" in
timations that sinister influences were
at work in Mexico to bring about arm
ed intervention, the Colonel put the is
sue squarely in the form of a challenge
to answer a series of questions about
the Mexican situation. He accused the
President and his subordinates of 'be
ing "woefully to blame" Tor the situa
tion which is now confronting the
country.
Coming as it did after a series of
political conferences with leaders of
the Progressive and Republican Part
ies in some of the principal Republican
strongholds, the last of which was held
today with Congressman Gardiner of
Massachusetts, but one interpretation
was placed on the Colonel's statement
by politicians tonight. It was looked
upon frankly as the opening gun in a
rousing campaign for the Colonel to
awaken the country in un effort to
bring about the overthrow of the Wil
son Administration. 1
The Roosevelt adherents were in an
enthusiastic frame of mind because
the Colonel, by his statement, had
taken this first step as the leader in a
fight for military preparedness, and it
left no doubt in their minds that Roose
velt would be ready to accept a nomi
nation and go into a strenuous politi
cal campaign if they could bring about
his selection by the Republican and
Progressive National Convention on
June 7 as the standard bearer.
TENSION AT WASHINGTON
Recent Destructions at Sea Creating
Delicate Situation.
Washington, March 30. The ac
cumulation of circumstantial evidence
indicating that Germany has engaged
upon a campaign of submarine warfare
which has no regard for the rights of
American citizens traveling on mer
chant ships of belligerent nationality,
the . administration considers, has
created one of the most 'serious situa
tions which has confronted the United
States since the beginning of the war
in Europe.
. Every agency open to the state de
partment was being employed last
night in an effort to gather an unim
peachable array of facts regarding the
explosion which damaged the British
channel steamer Sussex, the sinking
of the British ships Manchester Engi
neer, Englishman and Eagle Point, and
the alleged firing of a torpedo at t lie
French passenger ship Patrla. All
these ships carried American citl.-ns,
and all apparently were attacked in
violation of Germany's recently re
newed assurances to the United
States.
The next step of the United Staies
is said authoritatively to have been de
termined upon. Unless Germany, in
reply to the inquiries made by the
United States through Embassador"
Gerard, makes some statement to
cause the state department to change
its present intentions, it is understood
that all the recent aggravating inci
dents, will be combined into one gen
eral formidable indictment, which will
bring the entire subject to a clear-cut
isrue.
BRITISH ACCUSED
German Accounts of Sinking' of
Palembang
"The Dutch ministry of marine has
made a report on the sinking -f the
Dutch steamship raiembang," says
the Overseas news agency of Berlin.
"According to sworn statement of the
captain first mate, boatswain and
sailors, several explosions occurred
while a British destroyer was near the
Palembang engaged in exploding
mines by machine gun shots.
"Immediately after the first ex
plosion which damaged the Palembang
several members of the crew saw a
white track of foam and bubbles com
ing from the bow of the British de
stroyer. A special telegram to the
Lokalanzeiger from Rotterdam says
that in making this statement the
Dutch ministry of marine does not
mean to say that the British destroyer
torpedoed the Palembang but only
that a streak of foam was seen coming
from the destroyer s bow.
NEW AND BIGGER SUBMARINE
Takes Crew of 30 from Norwegian
Bark That is Torpedoed.
A German submarine, says the
Christiania correspondent of the Co
penhagen Politiken, bigger and Bpeed
ier than any submarine previously
seen and carrying a crew of 80, has
appeared off Utsiro on the southwest
j coaBt of Norway. The captain sent a
! wireless message that he had torpe-
i o(!(i the Norwegian bark Lindfleld on
the 17th and had taken the crew of 30
on the submarine, where he kept them
for four days and then transferred
them to the Norwecian bark Silas.
J The sinking ot the Lindfleld was re
ported from London ' on Thursday.
i This report gave the information that
the crew of 30 had been put aboard the
oarn biias bound for Queenstown
me l-imitield, which measured 2276
. tons, left Portland, Or., on November

PARIS SAYS ASSAULT FAILED
Object to Attack Village of Malar),
court Which Still Remains in
Possession of the French.
London, March 30. Heavy lighting
is again In progress west of the Meuse,
near Verdun, in which both France and
Germany officially claim successes. ' A
dispatch, from Berlin says that Freuch
positions. north of Malan'court several
lines deep, along a front of 2000 meters
have been stormed by German tioops,
according to German headquarters
staff. According to Paris, French
troops made an attack Tues
day night on Avocourt wood,
west of the Meuse. The French car
ried part of the works which the Car
mans had constructed. The Germans
made a fierce counter-attack, but were
driven back with heavy losses. They
made no other effort to recover the
lost ground. The recent German at
tack on Malancourt was made with a
fresh division which was thrown back
with large losses.
Another dispatch from Paris yester
day said: "After a six-days' lull, the
Germans resumed tho offensive at
Verdun yesterday (Tuesday) with re
doubled violence. Tho better to hide
their plana they had for a wed; been
shelling the whole Verdun front im
partially, but the French staff ex
pected that the attack would come on
the west of the river and made all
due preparations. Their surmise was
justified by the event.
"The German effort was confined to
a small section, hardly wore than
half a mil In width, between Avo-
ourt and Malancourt. The artillery
poured a hail of shells on this short
line all morning in preparation for the
infantry attack, which was luunched
at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. The at
tacking masses. about a division
strong, dashed forward over the
ground which had been plowed up by
the shell3 of their heavy guns appar
ently expecting an easy victory. They
reckoned, however, without the
French infantry and tho light artillery
which had been skilfully sheltered
from the bombardment.
"Using every advantage which the
ground afforded, the French infantry
held off the Germans with rifle and
machine gun fire while the 7o's threw
a curtain of shells which prevented re
serves troin approaching. Again the
gray-coated waves surged forward,
only to be broken against the stout re
sistance of the defender j.
"The object of the Germans was to
force the French to evacuate tho vil
lage of Malancourt, the hights sur
rounding which the Germans already
hold. They failed completely, it is af
firmed, and the French hold the Malan
court salient as (irmly as ever."
DEATH LIST STANDS AT 30
Result of Early Morning Wreck Near
' Cleveland, O.
Cleveland, O.. March 30 It is now
known that at least 3u persons were
killed and 40 or more injured in the
triple wreck on the New York Central
system at Amherst, 37 miles' west of
this city, early yesterday morning.
The three trains involved in the
wreck were the two sections of the
Cbicsigo-Pittsbtirg limited, eastbound,
and the 20th Century limited west
bound. All of the killed and injured
were on the eastbound train, the 20th
Century limited plowing through the
wreckage at such speed that the pas
sengers sustained nothing more than
a severe shaking up.
The accident happened shortly after
3 o'clock in the morning when a dense
fog prevailed. Engineer D. W. Leon
ard of the first section of the. east
bound train slowed down for what he
believed was a block signal of cau
tion, a mile west of Amherst. The first
section was proceeding at a speed of
not more than 10 miles an hour when
the second section, traveling
at three times that rate, smashed into
the rear coach ahtfad.
Overturning coaches from the
wreckage toppled over upon the .west
bound track. Immediately after the
colliBon of tho two east bound trains,
one of the engineers signaled by
whistle for the westbound 20th Cen
tury to stop, but it was too late. The
engineer of the 20th Century limited
applied the air-brakes but could not
check the speed of his train which
crashed into and passed through the
wreckage.
The last car in the first section of
the eastbound train caught fire, it was
among the passengers in this car that
all of the fatalities occurred.
Investigation of the responsibility
for the accident involves several em
ployes, some of whom were Injured
and who are at present in no condition
to make statements.

FIRE DEPARTBVIENT
SHED II
STREET 10
Had Hard Time Reaching Fire this
Morning
SMHL HOUSE WAS BURNED
Home of Charles O. Kane Caught
From Chimneyr-Furniture was
' Saved.
Fire which broku out at 1.10 this
morning badly damaged the one-story
frame house on Grove street owned by
Mrs. Charles O Kane. The fire caught
prcBumeably from the chimney on the
anglo of the ell roof with the main
building and burned downward. All
three local fire companies responded
and the release was rung In about 3:30.
Most of the furniture in the lower
rooms was saved.; There was $1000
insurance on the building.
The firo caused great excitement
partly because of (he hour, artly be
cause the first alariii rung in from box
18 was followed by a general alarm
combined with the! brilliant glare the
flames made after getting through the
roof, it gave the Impression that halt
the town was burning up in the dis
trict.
The Bradford Hooks were the first
men on the job but the flames had al
ready had such a headway that the ex
tinguishers carried on the ladder
truck could do little effect work. It
was not until tho old Tiffany hose cart,
propelled by sweating, cussing man
power arrived on the scene that a
stream was turned on and the flames
put under anything 'ike a semblance ol
control. One stream was enough to
do the Woru and thA force of the watei
was terrific, t nier Hears was on the
job with both feet f, and made short
work of the blaze after the stream got
playing. When the fire was half out
the Stark Hoso wagon " showed - up
through the slather of mud which
filled every street botween tho hose
house and the firo They had been
workiug.aiKe .neroccver since tne
alarm sounded, to get the wagon start
ed, but the mud was too much. Final
ly Bill Toomey borrowed a horse from
John P. Hogan and roped him to the
front and .with the animal's heip tin
wagon got there. There was no need
however, for the second line of hose.
The building was a small one contain
ing about fiAr rooms and one strong
stream soon discouraged the blaze.
Considering the distance from the
various hose houses at which the tire
occured, the firemen did good work.
Mr. O'Kane, who discovered the-blaze
and turned in the alarm, was assisted
by the neighbors in moviug out most
of his furniture before the fire readied
the lower story floor. Consequent!;
the loss was confined mostly to th
building. The fire attracted a lark,.
crowd chiefly distinguishable for tho
huge chunk of slumber still hanging
to sundry eye-brows.
The bouse had been occupied by
Mr. and Mrs. O'Kane about three
weeks. While there was $1000 insur
ance on the property, there is very lit
tle left to the place this morning worth
utilizing in rebuilding.

SUBWAY STORE OPENED ,
Men's Department at Drysdale's Con
centrated in Basement.
One of the most attractive stores In
the village is the men's department of
the Drysdale store which has been
opened iu the southern half of the
basement, where business has been in
full swing during the past week. All
of the men's furnishings and footwear
have been concentrated in these re
modeled subway quarters which have
been attractively furnished in a color
scheme of green and white.
The opening of this basement store
marks another miletone In the busi
ness of the Drysdale firm, the growth
of which lias been a credit to Benning
ton. (And this article is written by
tlie Banner man without any sugges
tions or pay from tho store's enter
prising " proprietor, Robert S. Drys
dale.) Few villages of this size anywhere in
New England can boast of so up-to-date
and cleverly arranged sales env
porium as this particular department
store on South street. It has been
truthfully stated that the Drysdale
store is "too big for the town," mean
ing that the town neither realizes nor
appreciates having a department store
of such' size located in so small a place
as Bennington. -
The store from roof to cellar, how
ever, reflects Mr. Drysdale's-personal-lty
and its continued growth in lean
years as well as fat Is evidence of his
business ability. Most men of such
ability are not usually content' to
spend their days and talents in a
small-town store, and Bennington is
the gainer.
The subway store has been parti
tioned out of the basement formerly
utilized for storago purposes, makes a
arge room, and the addition of several
windows in the south wall give ample
light. The access Is easy by means
of a stairway at tho south entrance
ind the whole is a commendable addi
tion to an already very-mucli-modern
tore.

Junior members of,, the Y. M. C. A.,
gathered last evening for supper fol
lowed by ' speaking 'oir the theme of
fathers and sons. Had-there been no
speeches, the .effect of such a gather

wa3 solarge that they could not be
taken care of conveniently at the Y."
M. C. A., so the affair was held at the
Rar.tist church parlors.
The object of a father and son sup
per is to bring about a closer relation
ship between parent and child. It" is
not a new idea, as the Association has
promoted these suppers for years in
other communities. The idea, how
ever, originated with a Vermont .raaD.
F. Ray Paddock acted as toastuiaster
and Introduced as the first speaker
Roger W". Burt, who responded lo the "
tcast, "Our Fathers." He read from a
compilation of answers to queiitlt.ns
3ent out broadcast to sons a significant
list of thing's which sons look fnr in
.athers, which might have been pre- ,
pared for just such an occasion.
A. W. Braisted then spoke on "Our
Sons," and left no one in doubt of his
.losing statement that they were "the
greatest institution on earth." .
The toastmaster reminded his Lear .
ers that (he Y. M. C?A: is an extSiiafrfe
organization, with 2500 separate or
ganizations In North' America,- una
f 88,000,000 worth of property: ';Tiis
-equires broad supervision. The in
ternational committee in New iork
City acts as a supervising and: coor-
linating ngency, and deals with a local
Association, like Bennington, through
the state secretary. He then intrc-
luced Byron N. Clark, the state secre
tary of Vermont, with headquarters in
urlington, who spoke with the au
thority of years of work among boys,
driving home a fundamental proposi
tion that the boy problem so far as
there is a problem is a man problPin.
He told of the father, whose escapades
were unmentionable, being tracked to
the barn late at night in the snow by
his son. He told the boy he should
be in the house. "But, daddy" re
monstrated the lad, "see, I am stepping
n vour tracks, and I will be all right."
That was a turning point in that man's
life.
Tho diners then stood and sang
stanzas from "Home, Sweet Home,"
ifter which the speaker of the evening,
Arthur J. Pierce, Boys' Work Secre
tary in tho Trby Y. M. C. A. was pret
.rented. Mr. Pierce took as his topic.
'Pals", and gave a list of reasons why
the father i3 the best pal, in that he
is the only' pal who will unselfishly do
mything for a boy, and the only pal
who can tell a boy the things he ought
to know as he should know them. Ho
then turned the tables and told "ha
fathers why they should be pais with
Ibeir boys. . .
The supper was served by the
Ladies' auxiliary. Tho supper commu
tes1 was under the direction of Mrs.
ljomer H. Webster and Mrs. Arthur J.
Holden. assisted by Mrs. Lucretious II.
Ross, Mrs. John R. Wilson. Miss Nellie

A banquet is not a banquet without
an orchestra and there was nothing to
be desired after the following gentle
men had made their contribution. 1 ho
musicians were H. M. Ritchie, Harry
Phillips, Frank Hurley. Lawrence Go
kay, Harold Cook, and Daniel Rifen
tiirg. Mrs. Paulson was caterer and ably
organized and directed her volunteer
rorco. Mrs. Roy Paddock, Mrs. A. F.
Loomis, and Mrs. Wallace Cutting, rep
resenting the Baptist church, made the
other ladies feel perfectly at home.
As they were leaving, each father
received a souvenir a copy of the cur
rent number of "Association Men,"
the Association magazine, this number
being a "Father and Son" number.
At the conclusion of tho last speech
the toastmaster pronounced the guth
