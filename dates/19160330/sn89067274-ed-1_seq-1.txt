Missouri Supreme Count Settle Ques
tion Involving Insurance Case
Tried In Audrain
THE FORD CASES AMONG THEM
The Gold Issue Mining and Milling
Another Audrain Case Tha
Come Under This Head
Fire insurance litigation in Missouri,
involving more than $500,000 will be
affected by a decision of the Missouri
Supreme Court Saturday in the case
of tile Gold Issue Mining and Milling
Co., against the Pennsylvania Fire In
surance Co., which bad been appeal
ed from the Audrain county Circuit
Court
In an opinion written by Chief Jus
tice Woodson the Court held that the
lire insurance company would have to
pay a loss of $45,000 to the mining
company on property' in Cripple Creek,
Colorado, destroyed by Are in 1910.
The Gold Issue Mining and Milling Co.
is an Arizona corporation, but the prin
cipal stock holders live in St. Loufo.
The contention of the insurance com
pany in the litigation waa that the
courts of Missouri could have no juris
dition on a loss occurring' on property
outside the state. Judge Woodson, in
his opinion, said that theory "is not
the law, nor never will be, as long as
the immaculate flower of justice con
tinue to bloom In the human heart"
The mining company obtained a
judgment in the lower courts and the
insurance companies appealed to the
Supreme Court, holding that they
could not be sued in Missouri for a
loss accruing in Colorado.
"" The same question determined by
the Supreme Court in the mining case
is involved in the suit of the Ford
Manufacturing Co., against 73 insur
ance companies, to recover for the loss
of its plant in an illinois town. Many
of the suits of the Ferd company have
been tried in the Circuit Courts of
Lincoln and Audrain counties.
Young People Royally Entertained

After an amusing drawing the

where dainty refreshments were ser
ved in three courses, throughout
which a pretty color scheme of pink
and white was maintained with
table, decoration; of pink and white
carnations.
About thirty guests were present
and when the clock striking twelve,
announced the arrival of Sunday
morning, all present agreed that the
evening was most delightfully spent
and expressed hopes that in the fu
ture they might again be the guests
