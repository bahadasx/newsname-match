McFadden, who is 26 years old, is a

timized many members of the latter j
organization in several cities, the po

traffic and make the progress of trains
slow.
The equipment of .the road also Is
poor, most of the cars being in need
of repairs. At the best of times a train
leaving Juarez took eight to ten hours
to negotiate the 1G8 miles to Casas

will not be made in less than 22 to 25
hours.
This, however, will be a considerable
improvement over the time made by
the motor truck trains operating from
Columbus.
Permission for the full use of the
Northwestern railroad would mean
lhat the border base of General Per

Columbus to El Paso. This step, how

The complete absence of any definite

While Carranza Replies
Promptly to Request to
Use Lane, Department
Will 'Seek More Definite
Understanding
Republican' A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, March 29. One of
the army's most serious problems in
hunting Villa was solved today when
General Carranza granted the re
newed request of the state depart
ment for permission to use the Mex
ico Northwestern railroad.
General Carranza received the re
quest this morning, and his answer
was in Washington before dark. It
was contained in a brief message
from James I Rodgers, special agent
of the United States at Queratero,
that the railroads could be used for
commercial purposes. It is assumed
he would be equally prompt in noti
fying ills officers on the border, and
that General Funston might . begin,
shipment tomorrow.
Although the array will proceed to
use the railroad on a commercial
basis, which is construed here as.
meaning that alt sen-ice shall be paid
for at regular rates, the state de
partment will negotiate further with
Carranza to bring about a more com
plete understanding as to just what
he has agreed to. Today's response
is regarded as lieing satisfactory in
n measure, but it is not sufficiently
definite. It may be. too, that in or
der to assure the arrival and deliv
ery of -supplies shipr-ed to points
'along the line General Funston will
desire to place guards on the trains.
War department officials were
greatly relieved by the removal of
necessity for maintaining a motor
truck supply line over desert roads
for ft distance of more than 700 miles.
A cloudburst or great storm might
render the roads impassable for a
considerable space of time, cutting
off the troops from their source of
supply at the border.
While the physical condition of the
Mexico Northwestern is not good,
many bridges having been destroyed
during the years of revolution in
Mexico, army engineers should have
little difficulty in keeping it open.
Aside from the railroad problem,
details of the protocol suggested by
General Carranza remain to be
worked, out. State department offi
cials indicate, however, that there is
no reason for haste in this connec
tion. As was the condition when
American troops crossed into Mex
ico in pursuit of Geronimo, the
Apache outlaw, years ago, the formal
agreement may not be characterized
until the expedition has accomplished
its purpose and returned. It will
serve, however, as the legal basis for
the adjustment of nil claims arising
cut of the use of American troops to
pursue Villa.
The order to General Funston was
dispatched late today. Under it the
general will make such use of the
railroads as the Mexican authorities
permit, pending further negotiations
with General Carranza by the state
department.
Secretary Baker issued this state
ment at the war department tonight:
"We have directed General Fun
ston to tender for railroad shipment
1 cargoes of supplies, either directly to
our militarv trien or to ejvilians in
Mexico. This does not involve any
tender of munitions for such rail
road transportation, nor does it in
volve the use of American military
guards on any Mexican train.
