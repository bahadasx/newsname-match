Daniels Tells
Plan to Board
UK; NAVY MEN TRY TO HECKLE
BUT THEIR EFFORTS ARE
FOILED.
j WASHINGTON, Mar, 30 Attempts
' of "Big Navy" members to heckle
Secretary of the Navy Daniels, while
he addressed the house naval com
mittee were foiled by Chairman Pad
gett. Daniels said he favored bring
ing the personnel of enlisted men up
to 68,000, amid repeated efforts to In
terrupt his speech. Padgett finally
filenced those who sought to annoy
the secretary by announcing that each
would have a chance to question the
secretary after he had finished. Dan
iels warned the committee against
paving attention to individual offi
cers who failed to agree with the na
val board.
Daniels asserted that the officers
who testified gave only their person
al views. He opposed a large in
crease in enlistments until the ves
sels were in active use so that train
ing could be continued rather than
have a large number of men with
few duties. He cited facts and fig
ures to show how hard it is to keep
the navy up to its full enlistment
strength.
EASTERN OREGON ROAST
PIG LIKED AT COLLEGE
The following story, clipped from
the University of Oregon' Emerald, in
dicates that eastern Oregon roast pig
lb considered something of a delicacy
among the students:
Pork three times a day Is the order
of eating at the Kappa Slg house
these days. And the fellows around
the fire place are saying they are not
one bit sorry that Tommy Boylen ia
not with them this year.
Last June the industrious "crimson
rambler." removed his cap and gown
and hied himself to sheep and hog
raising In eastern Oregon. Three days
ago. his erstwhile mates at the Kappa
Sig house heard from him. It was
not a letter. It was not a post card,
either. It was a pig. a hundred and
two pound porker, dead, of course,
and ready for the eating. The favor
ed ones say that it is the kind of eat
ing that makes one want to forget
manners and ask for more and
more.
After each meal there
dlsertutlon on roast pig. The fresh
men got their heads together and
reasoned it out that if Tom Boylen. Jr.
had come to Oregon one year later,
he would be here now ; and eating
l.ash with the rest of them.

EL PASO, March 30 With a fores
of picked American soldiers already
300 miles inside Mexico and fully
10,000 troops chasing Villa, the army
supply transportation problem today
was the sole topic. The Mexico North
western railroad announced it was un
able to ship munitions before Satur
day on account of lack of equipment
villa has been located, according to
unofficial advices, 60 miles southeast
of Madera, close to the Mexican
Northwestern. Pursuit by rail is Im
possible on account of 40 bridges hav
ing been destroyed since January.
As the report probably was delay
ed, It Is believed Villa has escaped
Into the heart of the Guerrero moun
tains where it will be possible for
him to hide indefinitely. The condi
tions under which the railroad eon
cession was granted make it necessary
to secure invoices from' Consul Garcia
for all exportations sent from El
Paso to Juarez. Garcia said he had
no other instructions.
SAN ANTONIO, March 30 Fran
cisco Villa has reached the Guerrero
mountains and Colonel Dodd's ad
vance guard has crossed the railroad
southwest of Chihuahua City, accord
ing to unofficial reports. Villa Is
said to have spilt his command Into
three divisions after leaving HI Valle
and has taken personal command of
20 picked men.
EL PASO, March 30. Several car
loads of supplies for Pershing's men
are ready for shipment today to
Casas Grandes over the Mexican
Northwestern railroad. Officers ad
mitted their disappointment at the
outcome of negotiations for permis
sion to get the use of the railroad. Tha
uncertainty of the road's operation,
due to the fact that the road la
known to be In poor condition, may
force a continuance of motor track
trains over the Chihuahua desert.
Wires southward from Juarex are
working, so the absence of news on
the Carranrlsta movements are con
sidered pusling. The American forc
es were last reported chasing Villa,
through the San Maria Valley, trying
to head off his escape via Madera.
Mexican troops are being sent to
stamp out a band of 1500 Villlstas
around Torreon. Three Carransista
generals are In the field against
