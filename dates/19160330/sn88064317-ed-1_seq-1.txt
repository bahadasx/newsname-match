R. C.-Duff
) On Cotton As Contraband.
Hon. R. C. Duff, one of the highest authorities on
International law in the nation and one of the most
capable citizens in the United States, when asked to
investigate the exporting of cotton and interpret the
laws of nations on this subject for the American plow
man, said in part:
"Article 28 of the Declaration of London reads as
follows: 'The following may not be declared contra
band of war: (1) raw cotton, wool, silk, etc.' Great
I Britain is not only a signatory of the Declaration of
London, but in fact called the conference and insisted
upon the inclusion of raw cottor on the list of absolute
non-contraband. Under this declaration, which was subscribed to by all the
maritime nations, we have a right absolutely to ship cotton, not only to
neutral ports of Europe, but to Germany and Austria themselves. Humanity
shudders at the thought of the death of the splendid Americans who went
down on the Lusitania, but humanity would have more cause for shuddering
If ft could hav« presented to it in some similarly striking and dramatic way
the woe, sorrow and suffering that will be occasioned to multiplied thou
sands of men, women and children in the Southern states as a result of
cotton being forced down to starvation prices.
"The reason why cotton does not command 18 or 20 cents per pound is
simply because Great Britain has a naval strangle hold on our shipments
and, therefore, on the world supply. England sends her ships of war out
Into the open seas, captures American cotton, no matter to whom the same
may be destined, carries it into British ports, sets up prize courts of her
own nomination,' which prize courts, of course, are operating in her favor
and which, under such circumstances, after whatever delay they elect to im
pose, assess the damages of the American shipper at whatever price they see
fit and. then, after having by such process 'bought* our cotton, she avails
herself of the extraordinary high prices existing on the continent of Europe,
produced in part by her diversion of onr shipments, to resell it at a profit.
The American shipper has no recourse çxcept to the government. The acts
of Great Britain referred to, according to the well-recognized principle of
International law, constitute war against the United States.
"This grievance is now of many months standing and the South is about
to bring to market another great crop of cotton. Under such circumstances
one would expect that our government, without prompting, would know per
fectly well how to deal with acts on the part of the British government,
amounting to warfare against our traie and country.
"It is not necessary for ua to resort to war against Great Britain in re
taliation. A simple adequate and obvious remedy would oe for the president
to advice Great Britain that unless she respects the taw of nations as regards
otr :o eigii -.-amort©, he will call or: cougtess to adopt a resolution forbid
din# the exportation of arms and mon.tions of war to foreign «outtttltH.*
