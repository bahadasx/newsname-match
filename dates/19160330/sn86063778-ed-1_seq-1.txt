Columbia.
The secretary and the assistant secretary
of the state board of charities
and corrections since August 4. 1915.
have visited every county penal and
charitable institution In South Carolina
except about 12 chaingangs. Reports
on these inspections have been
made to the board and. except in the
counties visited very recently, detailed
accounts of the findings and recommendations
of the agents of the
board have been sent to the officials
who have these institutions in charge
and to other interested persons.
Having gotten for the hoard of
charities and corrections a firsthand
view of the administration, physical
equipment and method of treating
prisoners, convicts and paupers in
? practically every county institution in
the staie that cares for these classes,
the secretary of the hoard and his assistant
will undertake the important
work of fixing standards for these institutions
and getting them introduced
through the co-operation of county officials
who are in charge of them.
In fixing the standards for county
penal and charitable institutions, the
agents of the board will be governed
by the standards in force In other
states in county jails, almshouses and
chaingangs, and by what they have
seen in the best of these institutions
in South Carolina.
During the coming months the
agents of the board will undertake a
systematic study of the cost of maintaining
penal and charitable instltu3?
tlons in counties in different parts of
r tho state. Whether or not tho county
c-liaingang system of road building is
excessively expensive has been a widely
discussed question in the state of
late. It is expected that the investigations
of the agents of the board will
help materially in deciding this matter.
Another new work which the state
board of charities and corrections will
carry on during the coming months
will be a study of the administration
by the counties of outdoor relief to
paupers or supposed paupers. The
county supply bill carries each year
thousands of dollars for "county
.almshouse and outside poor" or similarly
entitled items. Since the outdoor
system of relieving paupers as
opposed to the institution system has
been found to be especially wasteful
and badly abused in other states, a
study of it in South Carolina may result
in saving considerable sums for
the counties.
Death Rate High, Birth Rate Low.
Not only is the annual death rate
for negroes in South Carolina larger
than for white people but the annual
birth rate is smaller, according to figures
completed by the bureau of vital
statistics. The death rates, based on
.returns for 1915, are: For whites.
12.6; for negroes, 17.4. The birth
rates are: For whites, 29.1; for negroes,
26.7. One hundred and thirtynine
homicides were recorded.
Of the 24,501 deaths occurring last
year In South Carolina, making an annual
death rate per 1.000 population
of 15.2, 9,141 were white people, 15,350
were negroes and 10 were Indians.
There were 44,950 births, distributed
as follows: White males, 11.015;
white females, 10,127; negro males.
12,110; negro females, 11,512; Indian
males, 2; Indian females, 184. The
annual birth rate for the state is 28.

The
Teaching Adults Produce Results.

one South Carolina farmer expressed
his sensation on accepting an invitation
to become a pupil in one of the
adult night schools in this State, which
are giving new hope and life to thousands
of mature men and women?
many of them parents and grandparents?who
never had the opportunity
in youth to go to school. In a
remarkably short time this same man
won a prize* in his class.
This was one of the Incidents which
came to light on the occasion of the
round-table talk Instituted by W. K.
Tate, former supervisor of elementary
rural schools in this state, at a meeting
of the elementary teachers in Columbia
recently.
In one county there was something
like 44 of these schools, with 2.0C0 j
pupils enrolled?2.000 grown-up men 1
and women going to school three J
nights in each week.
The testimony of the teachers of
these adult night schools is that many
more men than women attend. This
at first was surprising; but when the
cause was investigated, it was learned
that in nearly all of these families i
there are children, most of them j
pupils of the uay school. It was not j
practical for both mother and father
to leave home at night?one had to
stay with the children, and since it
was keenly realized that education in- j
variably meant better pay, the wife
StnVPH fit hnmo ntwl lot fhn huclmtwl

if turn-about, the husbatul going half
the term and then staying at home j
with the little ones, so that the wife j
might attend during the remainder of
the term.
More Insurance Companies Quit..
Four fire insurance companies, three j
foreign and one American, ordered
withdrawal from the state on account j
of the provisions of the Uauey-Gilom i
anti-compact law, which went into ef- j
feet a few days ago. The names of all
companies that have definitely with- j
drawn will hardly be available before
April 1. when companies must again ]
be licensed.
The companies withdrawing were:
The Nationale, Phcnlx and Union, all
of Paris, and the Hhode Island of
Providence.
J. Arthur Banks of St. Matthews. !
state senator from Calhoun county, j
who has been closely aligned with '
John L. McLeurln in the development
of the^ state warehouse system and '
has been in touch with him during the ;
insurance turmoil consequent upon
me passage or tno anti-compact bill,
issued a statement "calling upon the
people to rally to the sovereignty of ;
the state."
Senator Ranks also takes the position
that if necessary the state itself
should protect the interests of the ,
rpoperty holders of South Carolina
in this crisis, commending the emergency
suggestion of Senator McLaurin
along this line. A firm and determined
stand by the people in the face of
"the flood of misinformation" being
scattered among the companies in j
New York and elsowhere in the North, ;
is the kevnote of his appeal.
To Increase Total Taxables.
The signing of the $4,731,720 bonds
and certificates of stock issued by the
sinking fund commission for the re- !
tirement of previous state bonds has
been completed. There are 4.008 cou- j
pon bonds of $1,000 each nnd two
stock certificates, one for $723,595.67
I and the other for $124.33.
By the issuing of these bonds $5.- j
022,745.97 of previous bonds will be
retired. The difference represents the
assets of the sinking fund commis- j
sion, which has retired an aggregate i
of al?out $891,000 in bonds.
The new bonds, which will be disposed
of in Charleston, Columbia, !
New York and Richmond, are exempt :
from state, county nnd municipal
taxntion. They are not allowed, how
ever, to be deducted from capita!
stock of corporations holding them; in
this way approximately $1,500,000 will
be guided to the taxable property of
I the state, as the other bonds allowed
[ this exemption.

Shelling In the Argenne.
Liondon.?British and Germans have
been fighting fiercely in the region of
St. Eloi, just south of Ypres, and the
British through the explosion of a
big mine, and by infantry charges
have captured or destroyed a considerable
portion of the German trenches.
The British infantry stormed and
took first and second line trenches
along a front of 600 yards. London
officially announces and Berlin admits
that German trenches in this
region were blown up, to an extent
of 100 yards and that "casualties were
caused among the company occupying
the position."
Again the bombardment has become
intense northwest and northeast
of Verdun, and the big guns also
have been active in the Woevre region,
southeast of the fortress. The
time seemingly is not ripe, however,
for an infantry attack, and the men
of both sides have lain idle in their
trenches, awaiting the moment for
attack and counter-attack.
The Germans, after a period of comparative
quiet, have again begun
shelling Bethincourt Le Mort Homme
and Cumieres, west of the Meuse and

their bombardment of the
Fren,ch positions in the region of
Vaux and Douaumont, which have

German positions in the Argonne and

N. M.?The first aero squadron

service with Brigadier General Pershing's
expedition in Mexico, has surmounted
flying problems more difficult
than most of those encountered by
European aviators.
The work thus far has heen without
serious accident. One of the
senior aviators said that only in the
Alps are the European fliers likely to
encounter conditions paralleling those
under which the Americans are nowworking.
"Never," said this aviator, "have
we had any flying as difficult as here.
We are under a handicap of an altitude
of about 5,200 feet when we rise.

GEN.HERRERA JOINS VILLA
CARRANZA COMMANDFR IN CHIHUAHUA
WITH 2,000 MEN SIDES
WITH EANDIT.
Probable That He Will Interupt Wire
Service With Pershing and the
Border.
San Antonio, Tex.?Reports thnt
i Gen. Luis Herrera, commanding 2,000
1 men at Chihuahua, had aligned him,
8elf with Francisco Villa against the
| United States, were received with
grave concern by General Funston and
his BtalT. Officially and unofficially
| the opinion was that with Herrera
joining forces with Villa the international
situation might easily be made
! bo complex that by comparison the
pursuit of Villa would be regarded as
incidental.
The long intervals between reports
j from the field commander of the
American expedition already had key
ed the tension a bit, although General
Funston and his cliief-of-stnff continued
to profess the belief that all was
well with the troops below Casas
Grandes, but the report from Chihauhua
made insignificant any anxiety
they might have felt concerning General
Pershing's operations.
T. R. Beltran, Mexican Consul here,
said that he had not received confirmation
of the report and he was inclined
to laugh at it as a "border rumor."
According to the version here,
Herrera was removed from command
and immediately took steps to alienate
his garrison. That Carranza has
enough loyal troops in northern Mexico
to drive him from the city of Chihuahua,
if he alms to hold the place,
was believed by military men here

tion here turned once more on the
railroad situation. Dispatches from
Washington and San Antonio that ;
military authorities were becoming in- i
creasingly impatient to use the Mex
lean railways, confirmed the belief
held here for the last week that the
railroad problem was the present crux
of the situation.
Machine Guns For Louisiana.

machine guns, consigned to the

Vera Cruz, the United States naval
collier Jupiter has sailed from Hampton
Roads for Vera Cruz.
Germany Would Apologize.
Washington.? Willi all evidence indicating
that the British Channel
steamer Sussex, carrying American :
citizens, was the victim of a torpedo,
it was authoritatively stated that if
a German submarine made the attack
tlio Imperial Government would dis- ]
avow the act. and satisfy the United
States that the act was in violation
of instructions. Thus it seemed that
the issue might narrow down to the
question of whether the United States !
would be willing to accept such a dec- \

Colonel Dodd is commanding the ad
! vanced columns that are riding hard
| after Villa and hia men and General
1 Pershing has divided his forces so as
to provide supporting columns along
the thinly stretched lines of comtnun- I
ication from his most advanced base
at El Valle. From El Valle another ,
line is being maintained hack to Casas
Grandes from where communication
with the border is maintained General
Pershing himself is somewhere
south of Casas Grandes directing the j
work of holding together his forces and ;
directing so far as possible the opera- !
tions of Colonel Dodd. Cavalry is be- |
ing used along the lines communi- j
I eating with El Valle where a detach- ;
ment of infantry is stationed.
Three aeroplanes are at El Valle ;
and will be used in scouting as soon j
as the high winds that have been j
sweeping that part of Mexico for al- I
most a week subside. These winds, j
according to General Pershing, have I
made effective assistance by the aero- [
' planes impossible. Of the eight ma- j
i chines that went into Mexico two are
! still out of commission.
Details of the operations about
j N'amiquipa that concluded with the |
' escape of Villa were not revealed, but
i there is little reason to believe that '
i he was badly whipped or even weakened
by the fighting directed against
him by the de facto government troops.
IMPATIENT WITH CARRANZA.
Delay in Granting Use of Railroads is
Not Pleasina.
San Antonio, Tex.?Carranza's delay
in permitting the movement into Mexico
over the Mexican Northwestern
Hallway of supplies for the American
troops has created impatience at army
headqurters that was hardly disguised.
The quartermaster department has
sent to El Paso a quantity of stores for
immediate shipment and officers here
did not credit an unofficial report that
j General Obregon had declared that no
! permission for uso of the line would
I he given.
Failure to send supplies over the
railroad would not stop the cam
i paign, it was said, but it was admitI
ted that it would materially retard
General Pershing's activities. Already
the change in the position of
the United States forces, observers
here pointed out. would make the line
of Nationnl Railways of Mexico, which
goes straight from Juarez to ChisuaI
hua, the logical one to use.
Whether General Funston refpiests
the government to get permission to
use the National, however, will depend
upon the answer to the request
j already made, he said.

he Favored Greater Increase;
London Favored No Increase.
Washington.?The Hay army in crease
bill providing for n regular army
peace strength of 140,000 fighting men
instead of the present 100.000 passed
the house by a vote of 402 to 2. It
goes to the senate for immediate consideration
virtually as drafted l?y the
house committee.
The negative votes were cast by
Representative Ilritten. Republican of
Illinois, and London, Socialist of New
York.
Mr. Britten opposed the bill because
he favored a still further Increase in
the army and London because he favored
no increase.
The bill is the first of President
Wilson's great national preparedness
measures to pass either house, although
various related measures have
been approved. It was finally adopted
only after Representative Kahn, ranking
Republican member of the mllitarv
committee mr-iln lirwl
?this time 213 to 191?in his effort to
increase the authorized strength of
the regulars to 220.000.
During the debate Chairman Hay of
the committee that drew the bill referred
to it as "the President's own
bill." It was explained at the White
House, however, that while the president
approved the ground plan of the
measure, he was not committed to its
details. The conference on the senate
and house plans, to come after the
senate acts, is expected by administration
officials to produce a bill which
will have the president's full support.

The depositions of some of the

embassy to be forwarded to the state
department at Washington.
From 30 to 50 persons, according to
the estimates here, out of 1180 passengers

The weight of the testimony is that
the Sussex was torpedoed by a submarine.
without warning.
At least two Americans on board
are known to have been injured and
one of the survivors declares that
Miss Klizabeth Baldwin, an American,
lost her life, while another American
passenger is reported missing.
Fable despatches say that the loss
of life on the Sussex may reach a total
of 40.
No confirmation could be obtained
at the ministry of marine this aftert
in of the number of lives actually
j lest in the disaster, but the estimate
| of 40 was considered unlikely because
it wns the women and children's sa
loon forward where the vessel was
struck.
A single, narrow comnanionwav led
from this saloon. Them wore only five
private cabins on the boat, four on
the deck ami one between docks, hence
the public saloons were crowded.
These cross channel steamers always
are full because there are only three
crossings each way weekly.
The officers of the Sussex warned
the passengers quickly not to be alarmed,
but a number of persons, mostly
women are said to have jumped ovori
board. Some were drowned and others
with life preservers were picked
up after considerable delay, in a few
cases ns much as four hours later.
