Luck in Chunks
Some people never fail to bend their backs to pick
up a pin, and yet let the dollars slip right through their,
fingers, without even a blink. They grasp at the shadow
while the substance marches by. If the point of the pen
is facing you it is supposed to be good luck to pick it up.
But there are greater opportunities for "luck" than in
stooping your shoulders in a futile search for pins. De
posit your dollars with us and we will show you how to
find luck in big chunks and pick up dollars instead of
pins. It is a part of our business to know a good invest
ment when we see it and are always willing to recom
mend it to a depositor. Forget the pins and go after
bigger game.
