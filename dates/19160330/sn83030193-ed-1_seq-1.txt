letter to the widow of ex-Mayor (Jay

use of th name of Mr. Gaynor In tho
proceedings before a legislative com
mittee holding meeting.! In the city
Juet now" brought a brisk response
to-day from Trunk Moss, counsel to
the Thompson Committee.
"I am in sympathy," said Mr. Moss,
"with every one who feels sorrow and
regret at the naming of Mayor day.
nor ami other individuals In the pro
ceedings before the Thompson Com
mittee. "It is CUriOUS that those whn rnriif.
forward with criticism of the commu
te are those who ought not to do so.
Dock Commissioner Smith Is a good
example. 1 think ho was n director
In the tnterborough-Metropolitaii, and
was associated with Thomas 1-'. Hyan
In a tobacco company: is a director
In the United Fruit Company, which
Is Interested in docks, and 1 think,
though I'm not sure, was Interested

Hyde, former City Chamberlain."

peated to Dock Commissioner It. A.
C. Smith ho listened attentively.
"The llrst Item," hit said, "'h abso
hitely correct. "I was a director In

In the American Tobacco Company,

It was wit . n great deal of emo
tlon that I read your letter about
my husbandfor thn family has
suffered much In silence, and it Is
good to nnw that thero aro still
friends left who aro ready and
willing to defend him. Thoro was
no dishonor In his life ho left no
stain upon Ills name and I can
only think that tin must have
"bruised tho serpent's head"
very sovorely to call forth thta
venomous attack upon his good
namo, when ho can no longer de
fend himself.
My husband not only Impover
ished his estate, but ho gave his
lifo for tho pcopln of Now York;
they aro Just and fair, and I can
not but feci that ho will llvo long
In tholr hearts and minds, as an
upright man, who was unafraid.
Sincerely yours,
