nliiKliisntldrush Iiu prefaced his re

politics.
Jiibtlfylng ids withdrawal from tliu
cithluet he Mild that If the grout dally
newspapers could express themselves
unreservedly about any action of tliu
President, if Senator Hitchcock was
permitted to dissent from the program
of the President hiirely he, Mr. l.ryun,
as a privuto citizen ought to be given
the priviledge of expressing himself as
u private citizen. He said he did not
agtvo willi the tonu of the notes ml
dressed to (icrmiitiy and that he pre
ferred to withdraw and he. able to
speak his convictions than remain in
the cabinet and he compelled to ro
main silent.
He said it was highly important that
tho voters of the state should elect
men in sympathy with needful legis
lation since they would carry out the
wishos of the peoplo whereas otllcers
antagonistic to the desires of the people
would do all in their power to thwart
the passage of remedial measures. He
said that were auy other man running
for Governor than his own brother he
would feel more free to talk upou the
subject but his brother had a record of
his own and had greatly assisted him
in ids previous libors and as Afayor of
Lincoln his brother had accomplished
a great deal. His brother was heartily
in favor of the prohibition amendment
and if he is nominated and elected as
Governor lie would be found on the
side of the people.
He emphatically charged Mr. Hitch
cock with being a tool of plutocracy
and said that the Senator joinod Wall
Street in its fight agaiust the Presi
dent. Touching prohibition ho said that he
had voted agaiust the measure twenty
six years ago, but that now he was for
it body and soul aud would gire it all
the aid He could muster. He had been
blinded before but now there was no
question but what the wet interests
were combined into a big national
corporation for the sole purpose of
robbing the people. lie gave as the
fundamental issue that the prohibi
tionists must prove that alcohol was
harmful. He then delivered as some
believe his best address on this sub
ject. His audience gave him hearty
applause and be made hit after hit.
The general opinion waa that Mr.
Bryan delivered a great opeeoh here
and the workers for the prohibition
amendment feel that his visit will re
suit in much good. Thruout the hour
and a half ho was given the closest
attention and he left witli an excollent
feeling.
Holmes Is For Blackledge
Lewis H. lilackledge of Red Cloud,
certainly stands high in the esteem of
his acquaintances in the different parts
of this judicial district. Petitions for
the purposo of placing him in nomina
tion for district judge have been sign
ed up by over a thousand voters, with
out an effort upon the part of Mr.
Blacklcdgo to procure the same. It
hns been purely conjectural, up to
the present time, whether Mr. Black
Idlgc would consent to get into tho
race for that position. Now, in view
of tho widespread sentiment expressed
Mr, lllacklcdge las decided to make
the raco. This decision upon the part

he spent his boyhood days. It is like
wise a source of pleasure to the voters
generally to be given an opportunity

Her Mamma Objected
What might prove interesting mater
ial for an up-to-date comedy drama
was inactcd in this city on Wednesday
at high noon.' At this time, Mr. Sid
ney II. Allen, of Clarks, Nebraska, and
Miss Marie Miller, of Smith Center,
Kansas, In company with her brother
and wife, appeared before County
Judge Ranney, secured a marriage
license and were united in holy wed
lock by this said official. Before the
ink had hardly dried on the marriage
certificate, the judge was calledjon the
phone by the mother of the former
Miss Miller, asking if the wedding had
taken place and requesting, if not,
that the judge refrain. She stated
that her daughter was but fourteen
years of age. There was nothing left,
however, for the judge to do, bat to in
form the lady she was a trifle late
that the deed was already done. The
frantio woman, in company with her
son, immediately an toed to this city,
but on reaching hero found that the
bridal party were already upou the
first lap of their honeymoon some
where between this city and Hastings,
whereupon Mrs. Miller and her son
proceeded on to that city in nn effort
to overtake them.
What the outcome was, or will be,
we are unable to state, but since the
brido bore evidence of being a maiden
of more than eighteen summers, made
oath that she was and her statement
wns substantiated by her brother and
wife, the genial county judge can in
no way bo blamed for the part he so
unconsciously played.
m t
Mrs. H. Neurburg aud son, John,
returned home Monday from Grand Is
land where they bad been visiting rela
tives. Mrs. J. F. Grimes and daughter, Miss
Irraa, of Hastings, arrived In the city
Monday to visit her son E. L. Grimes
and family.
Charley and Floyd Woods were call
el to Belleville, Kansas, Sunday night
on account of the serious illness of
their mother.
