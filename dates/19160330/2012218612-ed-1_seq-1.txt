In the Casas Grand ein at

cured fully half a hi4ded men

The disappearance -fthe Car
ranza garrison at Na iquipa and
subsequent reports that these
men had joined Villi was taken
at American headquirters as an
indication of seri<us trouble.
American officers siid the Con
stitutionalist troopsiappeared to
be cooperating withgood will.
Occasional defecti>ns of Mexi
can troops have ben expected
but there has been jno sign of a,
break reported hern on the part
of any of the Const(utionalist of
ficers. All appear to be follow
ing orders from G iterrez, Mili
tary Governor of Thihuahua, to
close in on Villa frin all, sides,
Villa, so far as the American
scouts have learred, has not
faced any strong Donstitutional
forcees, but has attacked Consti~
tutional lines whei2 only a small
force opposed hidiuick charges.
In such ;,fights, a:cording to re
liable reports reaching here, it
has been a case of "Villa coming
in on one side of the town while
;he garrison went out on the!
)ther.
There has not been a real test
>f Villa's strength. Mexicans!
vho have seen Villa's men say
-hey are ragged in the extreme
rhe men rushed into houses in
3aleana begging for food, some
>f them shrieking for it as if they
were nearly crazed with hunger.
Where Villa has gone he has
threatened he will return and
kill or. torture Mexicans who have
beei friendly to the Americans
or even those who have worked
for Americans.
Meanwhile Villa has been given
surprisingly little time for rest
because-of - the rapid southward
advance of the Americans. Little
has been announced about the
work of maintaining a constant
ly lengthening line of communi
cations, but the fact remains that
the men not only have received
their supplies on time but that
more supplies are. available each
day, not only in more volume,
but in more variety.
Intervention Inevitable.
Charleston Post.
The Mexican situation is get
ting worse each day, as it was
predicted and as it was reason
able to suppose it would become.
The invasion of northern Mexico
by American troops for the cap
ture of Villa has had the effect
of turning considerable sympathy
toward,the bandit, and there is
beginning a flocking to his stand
ard not only ot the countryside
ut of followers of Carranza.
Many of. the Carranza troops
were formerly Villa's men and
-tie call to them to rejoin their
old leader is not easily resisted
-when the traditional hatred of
the "Grinao" is an element of
the situation. The reported re

colufins that have 1en,ent after
.Villa will be seriois, and rein
foregments in -strength will have
to be ser:t and the field of oper
ation in northern Mexico spread
over a widei- area This is the
course that was predicted when
the hunt for Villa was first un
dertaken.
Practically the whole of the
regular army is already employ
ed in Mexico arnd along the bor
der. and it is not adequate to the
service with which it is charged.
There should be a force at least
double that now available ready
for service on the border or to
send across if the situation should
develop rapidly. It would have
been better had a volunteer ai a~y
been organized at the beginning,
held in reserve for whatever the
needs might have been, and, .by
its preparedness, going far to
ward preventing the arising of
such needs, It is imperativ.e that
such an army should be organ
ized now, and the proposal made
by Senator Sherman of Illinois,
yesterday that 50,000 men be
called into service merits the
'ost attentive consideration.
Perhaps that is not sufficient
force for the occasion, but
it would serve to begin with, and
certainly a beginning should be
made. The Mexican situation is
critical and it has passed definite
ly beyond the stage of watchful
waiting. The hunt for Villa is
steadily and rapidly taking its
normal and inevitable course to
ward intervention.
Fairfield Cotton Crop.
The last ginners report shows
that Fairfield produced 23,338
in 1915 as compared with 26,012
in 1914. This is the smallest re
duction of any county in the
State and proves that our lands
will produce more cotton to the
acre than any other county in
the State, without the use of
fertilizer.
On last Thursday a banquet
was given at the Jefferson hotel
in Columbia for the corn club
prize winners of the state.
Medals and money prizes were
presented to the winning boys at
this banquet.
AFTER A NEW COUNTY (
Meeting Held at Fort Mill, S.
C., and Advocates (
Get Busy.
Fort Mili, S. C., March 27.
There was a meeting held here
today in the rooms of the Saving t
Bank of the citizens of the town I
in conference with a committee E
from Rock Hill consisting of Ira I
B. Dunlap, C. L. Cobb. W. B. t
Wilson, Jr., and J. W. Marshall (
with reference to the formation 1
os a new county of which Rock I
Hill will probably be the county
seat if the proposition goes 9
through. The new county will I
take in parts of York, Chester
and Lancaster counties, includ
ed in which are 13 cotton mills,
the two plants of the Southern i
Power Company, and a large -
number of other manufacturing
industries. Petition blanks were
left with W. B. Meacham, presi
dent of the Savings Bank and
that the proposition is receiving
support is evidenced by the man
ner in which they are being free
ly signed.
Save Your Paper and Rags.
As a result of the scarcity of
the materials that go into the
making of paper the department
at Washington has sent out the
following circular:
The attention of the depart
ment of commerce is called, by
the president of a large paper
manufacturing company, to the
fact that there is a serous short
age of raw material for the
manufacture of paper, including
rags and old papers. He urges
that the department should
make it known that the collect
ing and saying of rags and old
papers would greatly better ex
isting conditions for American
manufacturers.
Something like.15,OW0 tons ofV
per board are- manixfacture
every dv.ifn the -United:States
and a .large pprtion of this,
after it h erv Ae
eseslver in
p ai-t
burned or 4 e-6
This, of course. has At be re
placed by new materials. In the
early history of the paper indus
try publicity was given to the
importance of saving rags. It is
of scarcely less imhportapee now.
The de-artment of commerce is
I giad ti bring this matter to the
attention oT the public in the
hope that practical results may
flow from it. A little attention
~to the saving of rags and old
papers will mean genuine relief
to our paper industry and a di
minishing drain upon our sources
of supply for new materials.
A list of dealers in paper stocks
can be obtained from the local
chamber of Commerce or Board
of Trade.

Soldiers Warned Against Al-_
cohoL
The following is clipped from
the current issue of The Literary
Digest, which in turn - quotes
from The British Medical Jour
nal. The appeal itself is; drawn
p by the Academy of Medicme
in Paris, and should interest
many others besides soldiers, for
which reason we reprint it.
SOLDIERS-BEWARE OF ALCOHOL
"Those who, like you, are ex
posed to exhausting labor, to pe
tilaus enterprises, and to strong
emotions, are ever inclined to
look to alcohol as a- stimulant
and a comforter, and to seek for
it in the tavern as a distraction
for the monotony of cantonment
and garris-n life.
"It is. therefore, well thatyou
should know 'what use you may
make of alcohol without impar
ing orhah -
are widespread.
"1. It s said t o g iv-e
stregthe h s
hol gives warmt T s -
feeling for al few mimites .but
the feeling of warmth which
spreads over the limbs after a
nip of brandy is delusive and
is soon followed by a lessening
of warmth and -trength. Men
who take nips are far more sub
jet to chills and to diseasest to
which mien at the front are lia
ble. Itis, further' asserted
that in the form of a 'pick-me
up' alcohol stimulates the appe
tite. This is quite wrong. It
would be difficult to produce any
man whose appetite had ever
been stimulated by a 'pick-me
up'. These 'pick-me-ups' habit
ually taken, lead without fail to
disease of the stomach, liver,and
mind.
"4. Lastly, it is maintained
that alcohol taken during meals,
as wine, beer, or cider, aids di
gestion. All important distinc
tion must be drawn between
'distilled' liquors like brandy,
and 'fermented' liquors such as
wine, cider, and beer. Alcohol
is altogether noxious. The small
glass after meals should only be
taken on rare occasions. Fer
mented liquors, on the other
hand, may be drunk subject to
two conditions. They must be
consumed in great moderation,
which, as regards wine, should
never exceed one. liter (a pint
and three-quarters) in twenty
four hours, and only at meals."
