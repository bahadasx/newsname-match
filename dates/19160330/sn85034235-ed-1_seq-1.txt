PROLOGUE. .
"A Tale of Red Roses,"
by George Randolph Chester,
is one of that author's best
stories. It introduces a typi
cal red blooded boss politician
cf the type found in many
American cities and a beau
tiful girl, with whom the boss
is in love. Incidents of politi
cal intrigue and high finance
are fascinatingly told.
The author relates, as only
he can, stirring incidents in
ward, city açd state politics.
In his slrenuous, spectacular
wooing the politician makes
(he girl the favorite at a gov
ernor's ball. Fie has diplo
mats, artists and notables of
every description pay her
homage. He lavishes pres
ents cn her. Fie anticipates
her every wish. His love is
overpowering, all consuming.
"A i ale of Red Roses"
holds the interest of the reader
from start to finish. Once be
gun it must be finished.
CHAPTER I.
The Dawning cf a Tender Passion.
A COAL wagon, naturally clioos
ing the rush-hour for the per
formante, broke down in front
of an extra crowded ear, and
traffic was promptly knotted for three
blocks. A shining big automobile, fol
lowing up the hill, came so close be
bind that the glare of the street cai
shone with unpleasant brightness on
the occupants—a smiling red cheeked
girl at the wheel; by her side a gray
vandyked man with sinister lines run
ning sharply downward from his down
pointed nose; in the tonueau a plainly
dressed and modestly pretty black hail
ed girl with large- and rather timid
eyes and a slender golden haired girl
whose chief mission in life, from hci
expression, would have been taken to
be mischievous fun.
"Hello, Bert!" called the girl at the
wheel. "Can you uncrush yourself?"
The rather large young man in the
neatly fitting blue suit who had been
jammed against the rail of the real
platform had already begun to worm
his way out of the ill humored throng
on the street ear.
"I'll try it," he laughed, "although I
don't expect to have a button left."
The crowd, its clothing still clammy
from the recent rain, made way for
him reluctantly, even though it needed
the space lie occupied, for the pompous
looking, vandyked man in the car was
Frank Marley, by all odds the most
unpopular man in the city. He was
the president of the street car com
pany.
The young man in the neat blue suit,
whose cheeks were flawlessly pink and
whose luxuriant black mustache was
c-urlcd in two amazingly perfect ring
lets, picked his way daintily through
the slush.
"Bert, this is the treat I promised
you," said the girl at the wheel.
"Miss Fern Burbank,'' he guessed,
clasping the blond visitor's hand, and
at the same time he gave his left hand
condescendingly to little Jessie Peters
"Welcome to our muddy city."
"Thank you," smiled the golden hair
ed young lady. "Of course this is
handsome Bert Glider."
"Molly's been telling on me." he
lightly answered as he took the folding
scat just behind Mr. Marley. sitting
sidewise so that he could address the
two girls in the tonneau nud still en
joy the clean cut profile of Ethelyu
Marley. known to her intimates as
Molly, for no better reason than that
it was a handier name.
The lights in the car ahead suddenly
went out, and a groan arose from the
miserable passengers on that suffocat
ing vehicle. A roughly breathed man.
who had been resting his elbow in the
wishbone of gray whiskered little Ilc-n
ry Peters, reached the point of heroic
defiance.
He cursed the street car company
nnd demanded, "Why don't they put
an more cars?"
Little Henry Peters, who admitted
lie was a stockholder, took the com
patty's part.
The conductor crowded back through
the solidly packed aisle and flic
squirming platform to jerk hopefulh
nt the trolley rope, and little Henry,
Peters, squeezed between his oppo
nent and the fat butcher until bones
could stand no more, popped from be
tween their peripheries yke the inside
of a grape, lauding in tl(è Solar plexus
of a tired Hibernian, wbi bad endured
more than enough.
"Get out of my stomach, stockhold
er," he gruffly ordered aflij pushed lit
tle Henry's derby tightly down over
his ears just as another machine drew
out of the fretting rearward line and,
stopped by the ragged gutter, rested
abreast of Marley's machine. The con
ductor having restored the lights, the
attention of the uncomfortable passen
gers was now directed-»to the new
comer, a heavy jowled man of middle
age, who sat as stolidly in his run
about by the side of hi| driver as if
he had been at home dining.
"It's Sledge," said the pian with the
frayed cigar. "lie gets-his little old
rakeoff, too, from jamming sixty people
into a forty passenger car. While he's
running the town this rotten old line
won't have any competition."
"Mr. Sledge is a gooct customer of
mine," observed the fat butcher.
"There's one thing about Ben Sledge
—he always keeps some, big city im
provement going on," announced the
Irishman who had extinguished little
Henry Peters.
Little Henry [lulled hi*. derby audi
bly off his head and rubbed the red
circle it had left.
"Mr. Sledge is the Workingman's
friend," he declared.
"Aw, shut up!" ordered the gaunt
Celtic laborer and kicked his aukle by
way of accidental emphasis.
It was strange that, while everybody
on the car kept the name of Frank
Marley sacred to their hatred, the name
of Sledge, who was.noto^ms^througk
out the United States for his utterly
conscienceless methods of public theft,
was received with equanimity.
Meanwhile Sledge, turning to see
who his neighbors might he, met the
eye of Frank Marley and nodded per
functorily and then bent his entire at
tention on Molly, gazing at her in stol
id concentration, with no more change
of expression on his heavy features
than if he had been reading a time
table. Bert Glider noticed his rude
ness and tried in a mood of intense
aggravation to catch Sledge's eye and
reprove him with a savage frown, but
ho might as well have tried to catch
the eye of an oyster. Sledge, perfect
ly contented with the pleasing picture
which sat before him, continued to
stare calmly until Molly, discerning
from Bert's countenance that some
thing was wrong, turned to meet the
small gray eyes of Sledge fixed thought
fully upon her. She wheeled abruptly
to her father.
"Isn't that the scandalous Sledge?"
she asked, annoyed and still amused.
Her father nodded his head and
smiled, his nose becoming still more
pointed in the process. -
"Well, introduce him. I can make
him stop staring, then." she ordered,
"lie can't drive on."
"I say, Sledge," called Marley, lean
ing forward. "This is my daughter,
Molly."
Sledge tugged at his hat and smiled
his acknowledgment of the introduc
tion.
"Glad to meet yon," he told Molly
T didn't know yon had such a fine
looking girl. Marley. She's a corker,'
and once more he viewed Miss Molly
with quiet approbation, in which there
was a dawning glimmer of quite un
Sledge-like enthusiasm.
"I tliink so myself," laughed Marley
"First thing I know she'll be getting
ma f ried.''
"Sure!" agreed Sledge, contemplât
ing her earnestly in this new light
"I'd marry her myself."
The street car ahead gave a forward
lurch, and the flamingly indignant
Molly darted into the opening.
"The ugly brute!" she gasped.
*=>***«
There arrived on the morning train,
escorted to the platform by a distinct
ly worshipful porter, a tall, big boned
gentleman in a light gray suit of fine
texture, a plump, careless man to
whom one would instinctively turn for
a tediously funny story, and a hard
jawed man of a most forbidding ex
pression, who looked about as commu
nicative as a cabbage. This gentle
man loafed about the hotel with his
mouth shut, while the other two
'•'scouted." Promptly at 11 o'clock they
returned from their various directions
and gathered in the room of the smil
ing tall one in the gray suit.
"Well, Timbers, is it as cheerful as
we thought?" asked the host, settling
himself in the most comfortable chair
"Looks gay and merry to me. 'Boz
zam," replied Mr. Timbers, folding his
hands on his fat knee and frowning
Intently at a little slip of paper he held
between his thumb and forefinger.
"Sledge is, of course, the whole works."
"What's tb.e approach to Sledge?"
"Tom P.eiulix." returned Timbers
promptly, consulting bis slip of paper.
'He sifts everything before it gets to
the big boy, and you dou't need any
introductions. The best plan is .to go
right to his olfice and give him the
straight story."
'How about Marley?"
'A fluff," returned Timbers con
temptuously. "Because he's the presi
dent of the street car company he
thinks he invented electricity, and his
noodle is swelled so that it cracks his
scalp."
You'd better lead me to this Bendix
person," suggested Bozzam. rising.
"Come on, Moodson."
Very automatically the silent man
arose and accompanied Bozzam Uoin
the room with the air of being just
as willing to do that as anything else.
Just as automatically he followed iuto
the office of Tom Bendix five minutes
later and stood silently by, so oppres
sive in his inertia that he removed to
fiimself all speculation about any one
Who was in his company.
"I want to talk electrical transporta
tion with you," began Mr. Bozzam
cheerily as he laid the cards of Mr.
Moodson and liimself on the desk. "1
am Charles W. Bozzam of New York,
and this is Mr. Alvin Moodson of Phil
adelphia."
Bendix shook hands noncommittally
with the two gentlemen and invited
them to have seats.
"I don't know that i care to talk
electrical transportation, but I'm will
ing to listen," he smiled.
"There isn't much to say," Bozzam
stated. "We think your city needs new
and better street car facilities, and we
are here to give them to you if you
will let us. The company I propose to
form will be bona fide and will be in
corporated for a million dollars in reg
ular money. Mr. Moodson will take
quarter of a million of the stock
himself. It might be some satisfac
tion to you to secure a report on Mr.
Moodson from Dunn or Bradstreet."
Mr. Bendix grinned.
"It sounds like a high grade propo
sition," he acknowledged. "I'll speak
to some friends of mine about it this
noon."
When Tom Bendix walked iuto the
Occident saloon he paused a moment
at the bar. but even though his wish
es were as potent here as those of om
nipotence, since he represented the om
nipotent Sledge, he had to wait, for
both the choice bartenders were in do
lighted attendance on a careless fat
man.
"Who's the entertainment commit
tee?" asked Bendix, a trifle sharply.
"A total stranger by the name of
Timbers." rejoined Phil, vigorously

mopping i:p an almost imaginary
splash. "He's so full of new ones that
every time he opens his mouth he
spills a good laugh."
"What's his business?" demanded
Bendix, who was an earnest collector
of definite information.
"Carrying hot ones, as far as 1 can
get it." answered Phil, laughing remi
niscently. "Say. this guy tells 'em so
fast you can't remember 'em. Bloudy
just asked him to stop so he could
write 'em down. He slipped*in a fun
ny knock or two about the street ear
service here."
Bendix walked thoughtfully into the
little Sack room, the bareness of which,
kept to its former crudeness by the
wish of the boss, was in strange con
trast to tho elaborately mirrored and
mahogany carved Occident. Here, at
an extremely plain round table, he
found the huge and impassive Sledge
gazing moodily out the dusty window,
while Frank Marley. with a half emp
tied whisky glass in his hand, sat re
garding him with a puzzled expression.
Marley turned with relief when he
saw Bendix,
"I've just been suggesting that we
build the proposed Ridgewood avenue
extension out of the company funds,
rather than make a new issue of
stock," he explained. "By adding
slightly to our bonded indebtedness
we can do this an.l keep the addition
al net earnings among the present
stockholders." and he stroked his neat
ly cropped gray vandyke, with the al
most smirking complacency of a man
who is sure he is earning a veptita
tion for superior judgment.
Bendix looked at him -a moment in
aggrieved wonder.
I
"I don't suppose you remember that
we liest decided on the Ridgewood av
enue extension for the express purpose
of reorganization, new issue of stock
and readjustment of shares," he chill
ingly reminded Marley.
"I know," persisted Marley. "But,
after mature deliberation, it seems that
to make the extension from the com
pany's earnings is the more legitimate
business method. 1 am not in favor of
the modern practice of watering stock.
The earnings, after all, are not increas
ed by stock juggling."
Sledge turned ponderously from his
inspection of the dingy little areaway
as Bendix left the room.
"Your girl's a peach." he delicately
'einted.
"Molly?" smiled Marley's nose. "She
is a beauty, isn't she? The boys are
crazy about her. It looks like a col
lege convention out at my house all
the time."
"I want to get acquainted with her,"
ordered Sledge, much as if he had been
sending the happy word to some rising
new politician.
A shade of annoyance passed over
Marley's brow.
"That is a matter which is entirely
up to Molly," he stated, with a trace
of stiffness.
"All right. Put it up to Molly," said
Sledge and looked out of the window
again.
Marley hesitated and half arose. He
knew that his call was over, and yet
he had something else on his mind.
"By the way, Sledge," he observed,
trying to speak as if the matter laid
just occurred to him, "that note of
mine at the First National—it falls due
next week. I am afraid I shall have
to have an extension."
Sledge nodded imperceptibly.
"Tell Davis 1 said it was all right."
he directed.
Bendix returned, and with him was
Bert Glider, redolent of the odor of
barber shop and with his curly black
mustache waxed and briliiantined un
til it was filled with almost, painful re
flections. He greeted Mr. Marley with
much more effusiveness than that gen
tieman did him.
"Hello, Marley," he said, grasping the
street car magnate's hand wilh tre
mendous-man to man heartiness. 'You
are just the one 1 want to see. I've
been trying to get Molly on the phone,
and they (ell me she'll be in at your
office some time this afternoon. Will
you carry her the happy news that
Dicky Reynolds is in town and that I
invited him to her taffy pulling tomor
row night? Tell her to invite Jessie
Peters."
. Sledge turned slow questioning eyes
on Marley.
"You going to be home ^ou^lit?" he
inquired. •
"Well, yes, I rather think so," fal
tered Marley.
"I'm coming out to see you," decided
Sledge.
"I'll he glad to have you," admitted
Marley. "I suppose I may see Davis
tomorrow?"
Sledge nodded assent, looking stonily
out meanwhile at. the hand hole in the
high board gate at the end of the area
way.
"Well. Glider, tell us about it," invit
ed Bendix as Marley went out.
"I want you to tell me," laughed
Glider, in happy unconsciousness that
he was a deadly offense to Sledge, who
called him "pretty;" "is the Ridgewood
avenue extension a sure go?"
"Why do you want to know?" in
quired Bendix.
"I have a little speculation in mind
which depends on it," confessed Glider.
"Subdivision at the end of the line.
I suppose." guessed Bendix.
"Well, yes." acknowledged Glider.
"Foxy of you to think of it," ap
plauded Bendix. "Your only fault is
that you don't guess those things first.
Who do you suppose would acquire a
deed to that land before the extension
was publicly announced?"
"I know the answer," returned Gli
der, crestfallen, but still handsome;
"you fellows."
"Certainly not," denied Bendix. "But
some friend of the family—yes, may
be. How much will you give for the
land?"
"I'm not at liberty to state,'' replied
Glider uncomfortably. "The owner
made mo a price on it this morning,
but it was confidential."
"The owner didn't know he was
tagged," retorted Bendix dryly. "You
may have the land, I think, for twen
ty thousand, Glider, but you'll have to
speak quick."
"Twenty thousand!" gasped Glider.
"Why, old Poison offered it to me for
eight"
"That's what we intend to pay him.'
"Give me a day or two to think it
over," begged Glider.
"All right; you're on," agreed Ben
dix and hurried out of the room.
Bert was about to follow him when
Sledge called.
"Glider," was his peremptory sum
nions, "what kind of flowers does Mol
ly Marley like?"
Bert Glider almost stuck the ash end
of his cigar in his month, thon sud
denly upbraided himself for a fool as
lie mentally complimented Sledge on
deserving his reputation of being (he
I most astute politician in the state.
"Red roses," lie promptly returned
and twirled the right hand curl of his
mustache. He stopped that process
abruptly and felt of the curl with deep
concern One of the hairs was disar
ranged, and lip fixed it with the aid of
a vest pocket mirror.
"Thanks," said Sledge and resumed
his interested inspection of the hand
hole hi the gate.
Sledge looked out o? the window for
long moments of thick silence, and
then he expressed his thoughts on a
plot in hand in this fashion:
"Say. Bendix, send a load of roses
out to Molly Marley for her party to
morrow night, the reddest ones they've
got."
"W
CHAPTER N.
Molly Invites an Additional Guest.
HERE are the red roses,
Molly?" asked Bert Glider
W ra as he walked into the re
ception parlor of Marley's
pretentious big house that night.
"I don't know," replied Molly, much
concerned. -'Did you send some?"
"No, but 1 thought some were to be
cent to you," laughed Bert. "It's too
good lo keep. Fern. By the way, that
'Fern' just slipped, and you'll have to
pardon me for k. It's Molly's fault
She never called you anything else."
"Who is it?" demanded Molly, more
eager to hear the news than he liked to
see. "The information is highly im
portant. if true, and I must not be
kept in suspense."
"Hold on to something, then," he
warned her. "One. two, three—Sledge!"
"Sledge!" she repeated. "What?
That great big"— She paused for lack
of words, and her face flamed suddenly
scarlet with indignation.
"Sledge," he joyously insisted, and
then, to the puzzled Fern, "You re
member the big fellow whose car stop
ped just abreast us last night."
Mr. Glider, who as a boy had been
an expert in [Hilling the wings from
flics, went straight on with the slaugh
ter, seizing immediately the glorious
opportunity which presented itself
when Mr. Marley, brave in smoking
jacket and pumps, sauntered into the*
parlor.
"Great news. Marley!" hailed Bert,
beaming with delight upon the joyous
laughter of Fern. "Molly his captured
a new honor for the family. Whose
do you suppose is the latest scalp at
her licit?"
"It might be almost anybody," re
turned Marley. wjio felt that his moth
erless daughter's popularity reflected
somehow on himself. "Who is the
particular victim you have in mind?"
and he laughed in advance.
"Sledge!" exploded Bert. "By tho
way. Marley, he gare you a hint of it
too. Didn't Lie ask you today while I
was there for an invitation to Molly's
party tomorrow night or something
ike that?"
"Well, not exactly, but he did throw
out some pretty strong hints," ac
knowledged Marley with a grin, en
tering into tho joyous spirit of the oc
casion. "lie asked permission to call
on Molly. I told him that was up to
her."
How unusually considerate!" ob
served Molly, biting her lips to sup
press the rising fury which had driven
the blushes from her cheeks and left
them almost waxen.
The Marley butler, a thin faced and
u,j >n legged young man with a pain
fully intellectual countenance, stalked
intellectual countenance, stalked
past the hallway portieres In answer
to a below stairs ring and returned
from tho front door with:
"Mr. Sledge, sir, to see Mr. Marley."
"Show him into the library," hastily
directed Marley, suddenly contrite and
feeling a sinking horror, as did all the
others in the room, of having this man
face to face with Molly, especially
after the crimes against her, of which
they had themselves been guilty.
The instructions were too late, how
ever.
"Good evening," rumbled the deep
voice of Sledge, who just then appear
ed directly in the center of the opening
hi the portieres. lie wore an Inverness
topcoat, the open front of which dis
closed a marvelous expanse of white
shirt front, spaced with diamond
studs, the glitter of which paled, how
ever, by contrast with the enormous
solitaire which illuminated the solid
gold watch fob presented to him by
the Young Men's Marching club of
Ward G. His hair was pressed as
smoothly to his skull as an earnest
Italian barber could plaster it. and
various angry specks on his cheeks told
how microscopically he had been shav
ed. The crowning triumphs of his toi
let. however. lie carried. In his right
hand he bore, held by a wide velvet
ribbon, in the same hu.ge fingers which
clutched the gold headed cane pre
sented by the Capital City Sledge club,
a thirty dollar box of candy, two feet
across, wrapped with six beribboned
layers of fancy paper and provided
with an absolute maze of drawers nnd
partitions. In his left hand lie carried
a speckless silk hat of the latest
French shape, and that, arm em-irclod
a conical parcel, so big that it would
have staggered a small man. while
from the upper eml of the cone pro
truded a square yard of screaming red
roses.
"Good evening. Miss Molly," lie add
ed, becoming more specific. "I brought
these for you myself." nnd he beamed
his cordial good will upon the entire
assemblage.
It was hi this breathless crisis that
Molly Marley. aggravated beyond en
durance. took her merciless revenge.
"How perfectly delightful!" she cried,
and she swept toward him with more
eager cordiality than she had ever be
stowed upon Bert Glider himself.
"We've just been talking about yon."
and then, to the intense consternation
of her fattier and her foremost suitor,
sise added: "l want you at my party
tomorrow night. Won't yon come.
