DANIELS URGES
NAVY INCREASE
OF R 000 IN
Seoretary Begins Testimony
Before House Committee,
Making Reoommendations.
ASKS FOR REAL RESERVE
Also Declares Annapolis Should
Have Great Educators In
English and Languages.
Secretary of the Navy Daniels
began his testimony before the
House' Naval Affairs Committee
today by making three important
recommendations regarding the
personel of the service.
He recommended:
That the committee authorize
an increase in the enlisted strength
of the navy of approximately 14,000
men, although the Secretary said
he did not think thai more than
10,000 or 1 1,000 men would he en
listed and the appropriation need
be ciily for the lower number.
That the committee include in
the naval budget authorization for
a real naval reserve.
FOR MORE LINGUISTS.
That the Navy Department be given
authcrlty to engage a number of civilian
Instructors at tho Naval Academy to
teach English, modern languages, math
ematics, and chemistry.
Secretary Danlela said If given per
mission he would employ at the Naval
Academy as great a teacher of English
And modern languages as could bo found
In this country. The head of the 'Eng
lish department, he suggested, ought to
receive at least 15,000 or W.ooo a year.
Employment of civilian Instructors at
Annapolis, the Secretary argued, would
make available for other duties a num
ber of naval officers now used a In
structors. He suggested that about forty-six
civilian instructors could be util
ized at the Naval Academy. ,
Secretary Daniels did not reach the
fttltldlng program of the navy In his
testimony this morning. He was per
mitted to make his statement re
garding personel without Interrup
tion, except In one or two Instances,
by committee members. The so-called
cross-examination of tho Secretaiy
will follow the conclusion of hla jjen
cral statement, and It Is probable that
before both the small navy and big
navy members of the committee con
clude their cross-examination, the
Secretary will have been on the stand
for two or t,hroa days.
Ono of tho Interesting sidelights of
the hearing today was Secretary Dan
iels' Incidental' statement that he had
chanced tho nature of the recruiting
posters and literature hitherto used In
the navy. When he uBsumed office,
tho Secretary said, he found groat
quantities of picture posters and litera
ture depleting naval recruits as baaklng
In the smile of some thinly clad woman
of the tropical countries.
The SecretuYy Informed the commlt
tco that ho had caused the destruction
of these lo-called alluring posters of
the prospective life of a naval man and
the appeal for recruits an Issued today
contained no reference to questionable
experiences.
Compliments Men.
Secretary Daniels pnld a tribute to tho
ambition of the. enlisted men of tho
navy. Under comparatively recent
laws, he said, t hit teen men frort the en
listed ranks liavn been appointed to An
napolis; seventeen havo been made of
ficers; fifteen liuve qualified as assist
ant paymasters, and lf.7 enlisted men
have been tranbferred to the pay clerk's
department.
"The day when the enlisted man Is
regarded as a mere machine must be
ended," said Secretary Daniels. "Wo
cannot havo n most officiant navy until
every man who enlists knows he has a,

Villa Is reported to have spilt his
force Into three divisions after leaving
El Valle, taking personal command of
only a score of men.
Some disappointment was expressed
among army officers here over the con
ditional permission granted by General
Carranza for use of the Mexican rail
ways It had boen hoped tho permission,
when granted, would permit tho use of
American railway equipment.
General Funston, however, fully real

the United State Government and la of
the opinion that the commercial use of
the lines will be a great aid to tho

Almost all the bridges which spanned
the numerous rulches oetwten the two

who have roved through the country
during tho Inst two years.
These brldFes have not been re

cannot stand nny very heavy traffic
and make the progress of the trains

Car Equipment Poor.
Tho equipment of the road Is nso
poor, most of the cars being In need
of repairs. At the test of times a
train leaving Juares took eight to ten
hours to negotiate the 1CS to Casas
Grandes.
At nresenl members of the quarter

This, however, will be a considerable
Improvement over the time made oy mo

INQUEST SET FOR TODAY
Casualty Hospital Authorities
Insist Policeman Told Them
to Limit Vehicles on Runs.
In a statement Issued this afternoon
the District Commissioners back-up the
sntand of the Police Department In re
ducing the speed of the hospital am
bulances in responding to emergency
calls.
A 'little earlier In the day Major Pull
man disclaimed responsibility for any
delay which may have occurred as a
result of the department's speed order,
during tho run of Casualty Hospital's
ambulance to atend Mrs. Margaret
Everly. who died there last night.
What Commissioners Say.
The statement issued by the Com
mlssloners waa as follows:
"The reason for restricting the dan
gerous rate of speed at which hospital
ambulances have heretofore been oper
ated, as a rule. Is simple and sound.
We do not believe It Is wise to endanger
tne lives of hundred of people in order
to save two or three minutes In going
to the succor of one.
"Some drivers of hospital ambulances
have grossly abused the privilege of
running at a high rate of speed by rush
ing through the city at a reckless rate
When high speed was not necessary.
Knowing that the pollco wouldnpt stop
them, somo of the ambulance drivers
have taken advantage of that fact to
endanger life and limb by reckless run
ntng won when returning to the hos
pital with the ambulance empty. Ho
many complaints of recklessness have
come to Major Pullman and the Com
missioners, and so many observations
of recklessness have been made by the
major and the Commissioners that H
was determined to require from am
bulance drivers some consideration for
the safety of the general public.
"It la very rare indeed that any in
Jury or Illness Is affected by a delay of
three or four minutes In the arrival of
an ambulance. Practically the only
case In which such a small amount of
time Is a consideration Is that of
hemorrhage.
"The statement attributed to authori
ties or physicians of the Casualty Hos
pital concerning delay In the arrival of
the ambulance In the case of Mrs.
Everly Is particularly ridiculous. To
reach Sixth and Pennsylvania avenue
southeast, traveling by way of B street
and Sixth street, at the rate of twelve
miles an hour would have taken an
ambulance only three minutes and forty
seven seconds; at eighteen miles an
hour, two minutes and fifty-five sec
onds; at twenty. flvci miles an hour, one
minute and thirty-three seconds, and at
thirty miles an hour, one minute and
fifteen seconds. To reach Seventh street
and Pennsylvania southeast, traveling
by way of B street and Seventh street,
at the rato of twelve miles an hour,
would have token an ambulance three
minutes and forty-three seconds ; at
twenty miles an hour, one minute and
thirty-two seconds; and at twenty-five
miles an hour, one minute and twenty
seconds.
"If the ambulance had been run at J
me ruio oi iwvmy-nve miiea an nour.
slightly over twice tho legal rate. It
would have only required about two
minutes more to have reached the
point where Mrs. Everly was struck.
We are Informed that It took the am
bulance at least eighteen to twenty
minutes to reach the point of destina
tion after the call had ben sent In to
the hospital.
Pullman's Statement.
Superintendent of Police Pullman today
disclaimed responsibility for any deity
which may have occurred last night as
the result of the police order concerning

How Officials View
Ambulance Case
Casualty Hospital authorities in
timate police order to reduce
speed of ambulances may
have been partly responsible
for death of Mrs. Margaret
Everly last night.
All responsibility disclaimed by
Major Pullman, who had or
dered "unnecessary reckless
ness in driving of ambulances

Hospital superintendent says
police of Ninth precinct said
District regulations must be
obeyed, limiting speed to
twelve miles per hour, with
slight modification.
Commissioners issue statement
supporting the police depart
ment in its fight against "reck
less driving of ambulances."

been made in three minutes

British Extend Lines to

LONDON. March 30. "The official

that the British armies have taken over

the French," says Router's correspond

France, "I am permitted to make ref
erence to It.
"Tho new dispositions were carried

tho result of them has been the release
of a large French force who were mani

"Although tho hour of the British

Is there anv reason to believe that the
Germans will succeed by their attacks
on Verdun In upsetting the prearranged
strategy of tho great coming offensive."

Lansing Refuses to Debate

The United States was brought
nearer to the verge of a crisis with
Berlin today when additional evi
dence was received tending to
show that the channel liner Sus
sex, with twenty-flve Americans
aboard, was torpedoed without
warning.
Ambassador Page reported to
the State Department that a Brit
ish torpedo boat destroyer, which
went to the rescue of Sussex sur
vivors, was attacked by a subma
rine. Two torpedoes were fired at
the destroyer, but missed.
This report, which was given to
the American ambassador by tho
British admiralty, is considered as
forging another link in the chain
of circumstantial evidence con
victing Germany of the Susex at
tack. BERNSTORFF CALLS.
It shows definitely the presence' of k
submarine In those waters when the
Sussex was attacked.
Ambassador von Bernstorff called at
the state Department this morning.
If he came with the purpose of pre
senUng Germany's claims In the sub
marine Issue he was disappointed, be
cause Secretary Lansing did not re
ceive him. He conferred with Councelor
Polk.
Secretary Lanslnghaa given notice
that he will not "debate the submarine
question with Germany."
In his Instructions to Ambassador Ger
rard. the Secretary has given instruc
tions that no formal document must bt
presented to the German foreign office
that would call for a. roply or & dis
cussion. The German ambassador said he dis
cussed "commercial matters" with Mr.
Polk. He would not discuss the subma
rine question.

Establishing Facts.
President Wilson and Secretary Lans
ing aro centering every effort now to
establish the facts In the Sussex and
the latest submarine cases at the earl
iest posjlblo moment
Cabled Instructions have been sent to
the American ambassador at BerUn,
Paris, and London to sped up the In
vestigation of the seven reported sub
marine attacks which have precipitated
one of the most serious situations con
fronting the United States since the be
ginning of the European war.
It Is authoritatively stated that tha
Administration has determined what Ita
attitude will be if It should be shown
that Germany has been torpedoing
merchant ships in reckless disregard to
her pledges to the United States.
Once fully ascertained, tho facts will
be laid before leaders In Congress and
perhaps before Congress tsef withl a
statement from President Wilson that
national honor will not longer tolerata
