Js this The Reason ?"
A few days itgtf we heard one
good citizens jumping on another
wliti stated that the county wna
tSo poor now to pay for roads or
iny other Improvements, and, af
ter listening to the talk for
awhile wo nre convinced' that the
foresaid good citizen knew what
ho was talking about. His argu
ment wa thit Powell county
fjenple did not pay sufficient tax
es on their property, giving it in
6 the assessor at a fraction of its
eeal value. He cited several in
stances of men who owned splen
did furms along the river bot
toms and who value this land
to the assessor it $f6 or $20 an
iftre, when, in fact, it was worth
1100. One man he mentioned.as
Having recently refused, 120,000
fjjr his farm which is assessed at
$8,000, and another who berated
fhv Board of Supervisors for rais
rti'g the valuation of his farm
friim $1,800, to $2,100, when he
huTi just refused an offer of $9,000
(kflrfnr if.
We suppose that this condi
tion ,of affairs exists in every
eouuty to a greater or less extent

honor. The omce oelongs- to the peo
ple and they- will choose that candidate
who suits them best. Only one of the
candidates offered will be chosen by
the respective political parties.
While it is true that the Judiciary,
in its true intent and purpose, rests
upon an eminence high above the piano
of partisan politics, still the law-makers
of the Statu have established primary
elections for the purpose of choosing
the candidates for Judges of all the
Courts wttnin tne uommonwcaitn as
wi 11 as those offices of more or less
political nature, and we must conform
to the law as we find it.
The people in the state and nation
look- to their courts for protection in
their lives, libetiesand property rights
The highest courts bring i n review
thelr'riglits and stand as a bulwark to
the citizen when his constitutional or
legal rights are invaded.
Hence the peoplo do, with care, so
lect men Of judicial temperament for
the Judiciary, and -it is ono of the glo
ries of the American Commonwealths,
and of tho National Union, that the
courts, taken as a whole, are above
reproach or suspicion.
Tlio seventh Appoiiuto District is a
largo and Important District, full of
business and full of development. A
largo volume or legal business goes
from this District to tho Court of Ap
peals at every term. Many Important
matters involving life, liberty and
property, must bo settled by thiscourt.
I promise you that, it elected to this
great ofHce, It shall bo iuy nolo purpose

right, to tho end that all persons, inso
far as in my power lies, shall Imvo full
and ample Justice regardless of their
political Hfllliations, religious opinions,
or stations in lifo.
I sincerely hope that you may kindly
lend ihe a helping hand, thus making
vuro my. success la this tho greuteat
ambition of my lifo, that I may have

urgent business while the grand jury
was in session. We are informed that
two young ladies of Stanton who were
summoned before the grand Jury, also
left hurriedly for other parts till it had
adjourned. As Judge Shackelford has
fined other witnesses for not being pres
ent when their names were called, we
trust that this will also be investigat
ed. The law is supposed to be no re
specter of persons and we trust that
Judge Shackelford will show no par
tiality hero. Tho writer was much
gratified while attending court to see
witnesses called to strict account for
not being present when called, and
Judge Shackelford desires it to be
known from now on that every witness
must be present and that they will bo
fined unless prevented t front coming
by sickness or other lawful excuso.
This is a good thing, as much of the
cost of conducting a session of court
would be eliminated. Spread the news
