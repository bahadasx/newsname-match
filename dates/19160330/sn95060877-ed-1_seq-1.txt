nent of the 4,119,507 voters
the United States, who in

yiz, cast meir Danuis in la
vor of Theodore Rooseelt
for president, and the need
of this nation for his leader
ship is certainly greater than
ever. From all parts of the
country, irrespective of par
tisan politics, we find a de
mand for this strong, vigor
ous, clear-headed Amercan,
whose knowledge and exper
ience of both internal and in
ternational affairs is equalled
by no man in this country
today, and we trust that you
will show your interest in

active interest in the meet--

upon. We urge that throughout

Yours very truly,

House naval committee that we
must first pass the bill now pending

it is a questionable policy to build
oil burning warships' unless an ade
quate supply of oil is assured at rea
sonable prices.
