ed condition of the school.

the finances. The monthly reports

quires shall be run four times.

A UNIQUE RECORD
Very Few Like It In Our Broad Re
public -
Home testimony for Doan's Kid
ney Pills, published in every locality, :
is of itself convincing evidence of
merit. Confirmed testimony forms,
still stronger evidence. Years ago,
a citizen of High Point gratefully
acknowledged the benefit derived
from Doan's Kidney Pills. The
statement is now confirmed -the
proof more convincing. Cases of
this kind are plentiful in the work
of Doan's Kidney Pills the record
is unique.
Mrs. R. B. Atkins, 500 Willow
brook St., High Point, says: ' 'I regret
that I did not use Doan's Kidney
! Pi"s sooner, as I would have been
spared a great deal of suffering and
expense. A few boxes of this medi
cine restored my kidneys to a
normal condition and relieved the
backache and headaches." (State
ment given Jan. 16, 1911.)
OVER THREE 'YEARS LATER
Mrs. Atkins added: "I am glad to
confirm my former endorsement of
Doan's Kidney Pills. I still have
great faith in them."
Price 50c, at all dealers. Don't
simply ask for a kidney remedy
get Doan's Kidney Pills the same
