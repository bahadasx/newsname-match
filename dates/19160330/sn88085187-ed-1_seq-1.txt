PUGET SOUND
STATE BANK
Own Building, 1115 Pac. nv.
In a room to B) light were
several men in blue-gray suits,
diligently working over sets of
books. One sat before a tele
phone switclilioiird. Guards saunt
ered about.
Through a door at the left I
saw lor the first time tile steol
cage.-i that soon were to become
my home.
Prisoners, in the dismal lil'.ie
gnty convict garb, stood about in
the corridorH, eying me curiously
and passing the word along tli.it
a "fish" bad arrived.
Within five minutes, as I
Icar.ic<l through Inter experi
ence, every man of Iho <•(•!
inmates knew of my ariivul.
"What's your MUM?"
I looked up. A uniformed
£U;ml stood over inc. Two trus
ties were beside him. One of the
trusties, a slim, Handling man,
was distinguished by a vest. Vests
are curiosities at Wai In Walla.
"I'eter Wilson," I replied tim
idly.
The guard wrote it on a pad.
"Commitment papers didn't
come yet, eh?"
"Xo, sir."
"Stand up. Take everything
out of your pockets, and dump it
Into your hat," came the next or
der.
The shorter of the two trusties
held my hat. 1 began stripping
my clothing of every superfluous
Hrticle.
And it wa.« at this moment
that I committed my first
mi-mi breach of prison eti
quette. I blushed when I
discovered It. I blush now
when I think of It.
On the lapel of my coat
was the emblem of one of my
lodges. The icuurd pointed
to it, indicating that I should
remove it. I felt a surge of
red over my face.
For it in unseemly and nn
inanly for any convicted man
to wear v lodge emblem into
prison, or even to refer to
his fraternal relations after
lie becomes a "con."
1 glanced at the trusties. Their
faces had hardened. They looked
on me with disdain.
In utter confusion, 1 removed
the emblem. Then Iturne'd hack
my coat, and began removing a
second lodge emblem from my
vest. The trusties turned away.
The guard looked down upon
me with an expression that show
ed pity for my Ignorance and a
•neer for my brazenness.

LONDON, March M.— Teuton
l'-l)oats have embarked on a new
cumpalKn of high sea terrorism,
despite Berlin assuraticf.s to the
contrary, was the view of officials
here today.
It was poinlt'd out that during
the first fortnißht of the month
HiihinurineH acted with caution,
supposedly on orders from Ber

But during the last two weeks,
siuKinns have a\erased several

Admirally officials said they
had proof tliat the submarines
worked without discrimination
and hurled t(Trpedoe» without
warning, frequently at night.

.".0.-— Eivldnce that Germany lias
started out on a cunipaisn of
Bubniarine warfare which has no
regard lor tlie riglitw of American
citizens is a<■■ \innil;<ting here,
Pftttteg probably the most ser
ious situation since the beginning
of the war.
Facts gathered concerning the
recent sinking of the stenmcr
Sussex and other vessels, showed
that all these ships carried Amer
ican citizens and all apparently
were attacked In violation of
Germany's recent assurances to
the I'nited States.
America's next step will he to
combine in one formidable indict
ment all the recent aggravating
incidents which will bring the
whole subject to a clear (lit issue
and refuse to accept the kaiser's
assurances hereafter.

WOMAN WITH MOST WONDERFUL FEET
IN ALL THE WORLD WfLL TELL TACOMA
WOMEN HOW TO CARE FOR THEIR FEET
By Edgar C. Wheeler

"Shoot her in the leg!"
her manager had uiiiioiiik eil,
hcraldin<- her comiim.
And so the heart of Wayne
\H.i-<\ Ye Likeness Man. was
all aflutter.
It beat Ktill more wildly when
the (|iit>en of dancers entered oil
tin 1 ;inii of Mi Husband. The
hini'K'st hope.of the portrait mak
er was about to lie realized!
Now if Ye Likeness Man had
dreamed dreams of how he
should be BUMter of the situation,
of how he should pose the world's
premiere dansetise, lie had anoth
er guess coming.
'I'he little dancer, whose tire
less practice and training had giv
en her the power and charm to
hold an audience brainless, knew
what was what.
Nd sooner had she entered
than she darted from one corner
of Hie studio to another, looking
over thb portraits With alert black
eyes that said, "Mr. Albee, do you
think you know your business?"
Anna l'avlowa belongs to the
tribe ol persons who hates to
have her picture taken. She said
ho. There are many other things

and BJMCii would have lih<l
the hravery to try It?
She faced the camera's muzzle
without flinching, for she had
heen under fire before.
She sat down just as if she
were attending an afternoon tea,
carelessly and gracefully crossed
one million-dollar foot over an
other million dollar foot, and]
flashed her knen eyes at Ye Like-!
ness Man with alook tUat said,
"Now, go ahead; do your worst.''
Ye Likeness Man was very
uervoua. He balleted about the
room, arranging arid rearrang
ing. The reporter, too, was on
edge, wishing that Anna would
talk s:oiiH'thing beside 'Russian.
Pavlowa tlruch her own pose,
a iiose that was her natural self.
Wtfyna Albee pressed the bulb.
