TRY TO FIX BLAME
FOR TRAIN WRECK
Three Separate Inquiries Intc
Disaster at Amherst. Ohio.
Under Way.
TODAY'S DEATH LIST. 27:
OTHERS LIKELY TO DIE
Towennan Ernst Denies He Was
Asleep: Insists Signals Failed
to Work Properly.
I.KVKI.ANP. Ohio, March - Uitl
twenty-ppven bodies recovered fron
yesterday's wreck of three New York
Central trains ;?! Amherst. Ohio, attention
today was focused upon th?
several investigations that were pui
under way b\ federal. state and railroad
authorities to determine responsibility
for the wreck.
Representatives of the interstate
commerce commission and the utilities
commission of Ohio were conducting
investigations in Clevelaml ami a'
other points in the vicinity of the
wreck. Coroner Charles Carver of Lorain
count\ planned To hemn an inquest
at Klyria into the death of the
wreck \ i dims and the causes leading
t he reto
Differ as to "Death Coach."
The question of whether the ??orailed
"death coach" on train No. si
was of modern steel constructinn. a;
claimed by New York Central officials
r w.,s of wood construction promisee
to he an important feature of the in
\ est1 ku t ion.
Railroad officials today were still diV
i?ie?l in ni.iiin.n as in whether t h
injuiip should be placed upon the tow
?*i man. who it is alleged by some officials
was asleep and failed to >;ive thf
proper signal. or upon the engineer,
w ho they say. it may he show n either
failed to see the signal or exceeded his
orders.
? ?f the more than forty persons injured
in the wreck several were sa.d to he
in a precarious condition today, and
further fatalities were feared. Kailroad
officials say that only twentyseven
bodies have been recovered, and
that they regard it as impossible that
more bodies are in the ruins.
Dispute as to Signals.
The two men to whom most of the
questions were to be directed at today's
investigation to be held in the
offices of Division Supt. \Y K. Schaff
were Engineer Herman Hess of the
second section of train s* and Towerman
A. K. Ernst of Amherst.
Engineer L?. W. Leonard of the first
section of train >?6. which pulled the
"death car.'" asserts he stopped his
train on a signal originating in Ernst's
tower.
Engineer Hess declares he saw ne
signal when he brought his section
along at a speed of fifty miles an hour
about three minutes later. Ernst asserts
he set no stop signal, declaring
the line was open for Engineer Leonard
to go ahead
If Ernst is held culpable in the investigation
the blame will trace back
to a baby's tiny ? rib in the Ernst homf
at Elyria. The baby was born Sunday
night. Since that time Ernst has had
little sleep, railroad officials say.
Denies He Was Asleep.
Ernst early today made a statement
in which he stoutly denied that he was
asleep <,r that he was incapacitated by
loss > f sleep He asserted that he set thf:
sigia' properly, but that it failed to work
a -hat th* ro ' ident was caused thereby

Loudon today forwarded a report that the
1 British destroyer whieh aided in . escu;
ins survivors of the Sussex had been fired
upon twice by a submarine. Ambassador
I'ape said that his information was not
I official, but apj?eared to be authentic, and
sent the report for what it was worth
; to the department.
State In partment officials consider
that Ambassador Tape's information
tended to substantiate press reports of
the alleged attack upon the destroyer.
1'p to an early hour today no further
affidavits had been received at the
State Department from survivors of

which Americans were endangered.

Difficulties of Personnel.
Secretary I>ariiels hejran his state- j
merit to the committee with ;i discus- !
sion of personnel. The annua! loss j
I from terminating enlistments was !- "
v 7 r. men. lie said, and wastage from '
, other i a use.-; was S.l'o'h To add a
j single man to the full quota, he added.
' meant that the s.must l>e first re'
stored by new enlistments. Kequitc- ^
I men'ts are so rigid that only one in six
: applicants is accepted.
j Conflicting views as to the proper
| enlisted strength, lie said. were hased
I on different ideas as to how man)
j siiips should he kept in reserve and
j how many man should constitute rej
serve crews. His own recommenda5
tiotis. hased on the experience of Mip
j department and advice of many ofh|
cers. looked to a total enlisted strength j
of men.
Navy Great Machine Shop.
"Tn time of peace." he said. "1 do not
! believe we can add 'jo.nno men to the
j na\*y in one year, as has been sug- ,
J gested. We now have diMiculty in '
j keeping the present quota full because}
J of high wages ashore." ^
The problem. Secretary, Oaniels said. |
, was to enlist men of the right type.
"The navy today." h. said, "is a great 1
machine shop I believe the day will
j come when we will not accept any
I man who has not had some experience j
'as a chauffeur or machinist or in other J
vocational callings." i ?
The Snroiary defended the educatioual
features developed during hi.- j
; administration. which lie contended j J
; were bringing in men of the highest x
j t \ pe.
"Vou can never have an efficient navy."
he said, "if you build a bulkhead so
high that young men who enter at the
| bottom cannot rise to the top."
Burned "Indecent" Literature.
I "f burned a bushel of recruiting litem- _
I ture showing men going to the tropics ^
j and associating with half-dressed women
| It was indecent All our literature now
j shows that men who enlist will get education
and vocational training. The educational
work in the fleet does not interfere
with target practice or maneuvers.
The captains may suspend it as they
deem best."
; Tlie far-rearhing naval reserve plans
'worked out in the department. M ,

j never before cared for. and are vital'
(elements of the whole naval prepared-) N
