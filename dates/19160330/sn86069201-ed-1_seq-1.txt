reasonably expect, the tax payers have
a right to know just how thtir money

judiciously and in such a way as to in

Tell mo, ye winged winds that around

It is one thing for Americans in Mex
ico voluntarily to take the link inher
ent in a condition in insuirection, and
to suffer because of those conditions:
it is quite another to have the peace

stroyed by an invasion of our territory
by these armed marauders. Not only
have the American citizens a right to
protection: it is the first duty of tho
American government to see that till
protection is given in the face of such
an Invasion,
GRATEFUL

tration. Get In line now and be a real
good Democrat and quit trying to find
so much fault with your brother editors
and the present State administration.

VALUABLE SERVICE"
RENDERED STATE.
There comes to our notice the last
issue of The Itegister, of Uie State
Historical Society, edited by Mrs. Jen
nie C, Morton, at Frankfort. The Beg
ister is Tull of historical data, among
which is the Boone Iiecords containing
the Boone genealogy dating from
1CM. Few people In Kentucky know
and appreciate, as they should, the ser
vices rendered the state by Mrs. Mor
ton and her lister in collecting and
preserving the records of distinguished
men and women who have made Ken
tucky famous. But for these untiring,
patiiotic and versatile women much
valuable information would be lost to
posterity. Kentucky owes them a debt
of gratitude it can never repay.
ROAD HOG" IS
DISAPPEARING.
The farmer who used to hold the
center of the road with his wagon
heavily loaded with produce, fn short,
the "road bog", is rapidly disappearing
fn Kentucky, as any motorist who trav
els the State highways will testify.
The obnoxious automobilo of a few
years ago has come to be a luxury and
convenience that the broad-minded far
mer has been quick to appreciate, and
the very fact that the farmer himself
has become a motorist lias removed the
last vestige of envy on his part. The
trials of the motorist are now the trials
of tho farmer, and there U a general
tendency to remove all obstacles that
make legitimate motoring unpleasant.
t Mr. Harry Tomlinson, ho recently
sold his Interest In the firm of Logan,
Anderson and Tomlli.son has purchased
the Interest of Mr. Alex Doty of the
firm of Davidson & Doty. The new
firm whose advertisement appears In
this Issue of the Itecord will be ready
for business April 1st. Success to
them.
SHEEP MONEY HERE
Those having claims for sheep killed
by dogs during the year 1916 will be
paid in full, if they will present them
to County Clerk, Joe Hamilton. It
Isn't every year that these claims will
pay dollar for dollar, but the tax receiv
ed from dog bwners last year amounts
to about $1,000 and tho total damaged
allowed for sheep killed was only $G19.
Tho balance goes Into the school fund.
GRAND JURY ADJOURNS
After Reluming Tvicnly Indictments.
Tlie grand-jury finally adjourned last
Friday after sitting six days nnd re
turning In all about twenty indictments.
In their final report to the court they
compliment the county olficials for the
work they have accomplished in re-mod
eling the Court House and the spending
of the peoples money so judiciously.
The following report, which is un in
teresting one, Wb print in full.
"To the lion. Charles A. Hardin,
Judge, Gurrard Circuit Court.
We, the grand jury impaneled by you
on the 1st day of the present March
Term PJ1C, have completed our work,
and beg to report that we investigated
all the jail cases and returned indict
ments, and all other irregularities were
fully investigated, including the charge
made against Governor A. 0. Stanley,
that he looked as though he had been
drinking when he pasied Luncuster on
the special train last November, und
we find that the local minister who
made this charge was entirely mistaken
m his insinuation and our investigation
uf the facta show that Gov. Stanley
was not drunk and had not been drink
ing at that time.
We beg leave to report that we find
that whiskey has been sold both in the
County, and in the city of Lancaitcr
and Indictments have been returned in
all the cases we have been able to get
evidence to justify indictments. In the
city of Lancaster we find that practi
cany all the Illegal sale or liquor came
from a few blind tigers and the owners
and operators of these are now in jail,
In the County we find very little liquor
being sold. The people of llryantsville
report that very little Is being sold
there now, and other sections of the
county is equally free from this condi
tion.
We have been investigating violation
of the lottery Statute, and recommend
to the grand jury for the next term of
Court that they continue the investiga
tion to the end that there may be no
violations by operating Blot machines,
punch boards, radios, and all kinds of
illegal drawing contests, and should
there be any violations, to promptly in
dict and put an end to this gambling
school.
We investigated the County Institu
tions and found them in reasonably
good condition. The re-modeled Court
house is un honor to the County of Gar
rard rnd the present officials of the
county deserve credit for the woodwork
they have dune in s'pending the peoples
money so judiciously.
Nothing further having come under
our observation, we beg to be. finally
exalted. Respectfully submitted.

NOTICE.
The Btstin Telephone Company takes
pleasure in announcing that they have
installed a first class Exchange fn Lan
caster with a metallic circuit, with two
wires for each 'phone, tiiereby insuring
a much better service than the old
grounded wire system. The Company
has spent over Six Thousand Dollars
($0000.) to make this improvement, and
expects to spend more until it makes it
one of tho very best systems in the
State of Kentucky. When the present
system whs installed at $1.00 pur month
there were not more than forty 'phones
connerted through the Exchange, but
now the Company has a connection of
more than six hundred 'phones. In the
last year material has doubled In cost
and is increasing every day. Our taxes
have greatly increased and the expense
of operation Is greater than ever be
fore, and It is impossible to operate
under the present rate and make ex
penses. It is, therefore, necessary
that the rates on and after the first day
of April, 1910, will be $1.60 for resi
dence 'phones per month and 2.00 per
month for business 'phones. Wo de
sire to jx press our appreciation for past
patronage from the public and solicit
your futuro patronage under the rates
announced, which we assure you are
reasonable and just and much lower
than the rates (n other towns and coun
ties of the State of Kentucky,
