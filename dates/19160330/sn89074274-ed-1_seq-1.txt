Washington, March 28.—Diplomatic
and domestic aspects of the Mexican
problem overshadowed its millitary
side here tonight, official report from
General Funston including no change
on the situation on the border or in
Mexico. Congress rushed through an
emergency appropriation of $8,611,502
to pay for the pursuit of the bandit,
and the state department prepared to
press General Carranza.for permission
to use Mexican railroads to. solve the
troops' supply problem.
Border rumors contained in the
press reports, that failure to obtain
use of the railroad might seriously
hamper the pursuit of Villa, wore not
reflected at either the state or war de
partment.
Senator Gallinger, Republican leader
in the senate, presented to Secretary
Baker a telegram from Senator Fall of
El Paso, dealing with railroad and
border questions. He declared ship
ments of gasoline intended for the
American forces in Mexico were being
held up by Carranza officials.
"The department dispatches of last
night and tonight, while meager and
dealing with technical matters, indi
cate continued ana growing good will
toward our expedition in Mexico,"
Secretary Baker said later in a state'
ment. "Its object appears to be thor
oughly understood by the people of
'Mexico. We have no dispatches indi
cating any cause for apprehension."
The communication to General Ca-
ranza will be made through Special
Representative Rogers, at Aqueratero,
to whom instructions went forward to
night. Special department officials said
it seemed necessary to impress upon'
the de facto government the need for
special consideration of the request to
use the lines south frtm the border
•without awaiting the perfecting of the
protocol under negotiation.
While there was no question but
that the expedition after Villa would
press on, it was stated that while a
sufficient amount of supplies could be
supplied to the troops by motor truck
trains, general use oL the lines would
greatly simplify matters.
News dispatches from the border
tonight indicating that the American
troops already were using the railroad
lines in some sections were read with
surprise at the war department, offi
cials declaring ti.'.re had been no offi
cial advices to that effect. It was
thought that if the American com
manders had unod the lines in some
cases on their own initiative, it prob
ably was done on co-operation with
the local Carranza authorities, officials
•do not think and extensive use of
xailroad has been made.
There are indications that the check
1n the protocol nsgotiatiucs resulting
.from General Carranza's counter pro
posals may extend that discussion a
week or more.

The fourth annual ball of the Ma
sons will be given at the Armory on

sonic after-Easter parties which hare
been given the past three seasons have
been very delightful occasions and the
committee in charge of arrangements
is determined that this season's party
shall excel even those of the past.
The decorations will be under the su
pervision of Herman Stern and Prof
R. R. Ebersold, which is assurance
that the Armory will be trimmed be
yond its Jjest for this occasion. The
committee will endeavor to be mindful
of every detail that will make for the
success of this party, even to the selec
tion of music for the orchestra. Five
cotillions will be conducted during the
evening, interspersed at intervals, and

Rate Expert Matter
Up Next Thursday
Bismarck, March 28.—The case re
garding the salary of Mr. Little, the
rate expert for the railroad commis
sion, came up before Judge Nuessle
Monday and was postponed till Thurs
day of this week.
Little was engaged as rate Expert in
the lignite coal rate case which the
commission has had under considera
tion for some time. There' being no
funds for his salary, the emergency
board set aside $4,000 for his salary for
two years. He moved here with his
family and supposed all was regular
and that no trouble would occur.
However, certain parties got busy and
raised the question as to the legality
of the act of the emergency board in
appropriating said money for his sal
aray.
Next Thursday the question will be
argued before Judge Nuessle, and it is
quite probable it will go up to the su
preme court, no matter which way he
decides.

Order of Eastern Stars
Had Splendid Meeting
The Order of Eastern Star held their
regular meeting Tuesday evening in
the Masonic Temple with a good at
tendance. After the meeting a social
evening was enjoyed. The program
was in charge of Mrs. T. S. Henry and

Dress-Up Week
National Affair
Not to be behind the other progres
sive cities of the United States, the
citizens of Valley City and Barnes
county are this week observing Dress
Up Week.
The United States is enjoying the
greatest prosperity in its history, and
money is pouring in on every hand.
To give fitting expression to our ap
preciation of our good fortune when
the rest of the world is suffering from
the most destructive war of history,
Dress-Up Week has been set apart as
a national festival.
Valley City merchants are making
use of the opportunity to demonstrate
the fact that they can and do furnish
the best on the market at priceMhat
are as low as the same class of goods
can be sold for anywhere. The Times
Record has heretofore remarked on
the up-to-date stocks that are carried
by our merchants, the displays this
week abundantly corroborate our
judgment.
There is proof aplenty that the mer
chants of Valley City are able to care
for the needs of every resident ol
Barnes county. As a citizen of the
county every reader of the Times-Rec
ord should investigate the possibili
ties of his home stores before sending
money away to other cities.'
Dress-Up Week ought to serve to
bring the citizens of the county closer
together in every way. No man can
live to himself alone the farmer and
the merchant need each other to make
a well-balanced community. If the ob
servance of Dress-Up Week serves to
strengthen the chain of friendship it
will have amply served its purpose.

FARMERS ARE AT WORK
IN NORTH DAKOTA FIELDS
St. Paul, March 25.—First reports of
farmers getting into the fields were
brought to St. Paul today by H. A.
Blocker, president State Bank of Bow
man, N. D. Mr. Blocker, who called
at the First National bank, said that
farmers near Bowman went to work in
the fields several days ago.
"The outlook is favorable," said Mr.
Blocker, "and this ought to be a great
year. Added to the big advance made
in farming, North Dakota is becoming
a great cattle state. Cattle are being
imported in all sections and it is good
stock. St. Paul gets nearly all of the
cattle business from North Dakota."
Mr. Blocker purchased two carloads
of cattle at South St. Paul and shipped
them to North Dakota. This makes
five cars of cattle Mr. Blocker has
shipped in less than a lear from South
St. Paul and is indicative of the large
cattle business in North Dakota.
During 1915 deposits in the State
Bank of Bowman almost doubled by
increasing $98,000.
Monday afternoon Mrs. F. C.
Schroeder was the hostess at a very
pretty parcel shower given at her

Midland Continental
Jumps Track Tuesday
The north bound Midland Contin
ental train was ditched Tuesday after
noon about a mile and a half south
of Nortonville. It is thought the
spreading of the rails was the cause.
The only thing left on the track was
the engine. It was a mixed train, and
aside from some severe jolts and
bruises, no one was injured. A tank
of gasoline was spilled out onto the
prairie, and a carload of automobiles
was rolled over, but nothing was dam
aged, excepting the gasoline, and the
property of the railroad.- Rev. Ver
milya was on the train at the time
of the accident and reports that it
was rather thrilling and all were glad
to escape so luckily.
Farewell Party for Classmate
Tuesday, after school, the sixth
grade girls and their teacher, Misa
Anna Larson, of the Lincoln school,
gave a farewell party for their school
mate, Mayme McKay, who will soon
leave for her farm home. Games were
played and a general good time indulg
ed in and a dainty lunch closed the
evening. The girls presented their
friend with a friendship ring and a
bouquet of carnations.
