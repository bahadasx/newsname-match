The argument was concluded In the
case of the State of Texas vs. Tony
Woodward, tharged with the murder
of Jim Steepleton, Wednesday after
noon at 8: Sit. In our report of the
rase ye.-nerady we stated the a6
would probably not Le submtHed to
the jury before today, but the attor
neys aureed yesterday on only two
hours to each side for argument,
which ne essartlr shortened the caso.
JudK" J. W. Horenius cloned the ras
for the defense in a spee u of thir
ty minute's, making a most poerful
and logjtul plea for an cuuittal. Ha
was followed by District Attorney W.
C. Davis In a speech of about one
hour and twenty minutes. Ills address
was lHpned la by a large crowd of
Interested Siectators. He made an
earnest plea for the conviction of the
defendant, at timet growing very e!r.
Hient. The Jury took the case under
advisement until 9 oYlo k last night
and retired at that hour. This morn
ing they t,M,k the papers in the case
and again c nsldere I It until 9:21,
when they filed into court and pre
Kei,i,.d the following vcnllit: "We,
the j.iry. find the defendant not guilty.
W. W. Crlffln. Foreman."
No case tried here In years created
more Interest than the Woodward case
has. The defendant, an Italian mer
chant on North Main street, shot to
death Jim Steepleton on the 1Mb. day
of January. 1915. in the yard of An
tone Pureck In the nonrthern part of
the city. His pleat was self-defense.
