We have just had the pleasure
of looking through ouoof the new
premium catalogues issued byH
the United Drug Co. manufact
urers of Rexall Remedies, for the
use of the customers of thou
sands of Rexall Stores in the
United States, Canada, England'
and Ireland. This book is truly
a work of art, beautifully gotten
up in colors, illustrating and de
scribing nationally advertised ar
ticles which the customers arc
able to obtain at 'exactly one half
price through the Rexall Stores.
We could hardly realize how
this were possible until we were
shown that this company is the
largest of its kind in the world,,
being a fifty million dollar cor
poration with a system of distri
bution unequaled by any other
concern.' Hence, the enormous
buying powers and method of
distribution compells the price.
Mr. Lefler who owns the Rexall
Store here says it is one of the
biggest things he has tackled in
a long time and one of the best
things he has ever had the pleas
ure of handing out to bis cus
tomers. We are m.receipt of a very ap
preciative letter from H. C. Hei
gert of Pueblo, Colo., in which
he states that he likes the Herald
very much. Mr. Heigert is in
terested in this county, as he
has some fine land just west of
Hayti, and in the near future ex
pects to move on it. We would
be glad to welcome him to our
county.
Mr. and Mrs. Ben Barkovitz
of Wardell came up Sunday and

Mrs. Barkovitz, nee Rosa Kohn,
remained over for a few days
visit.
The best proof we've seen that
the Democrats did good work at
