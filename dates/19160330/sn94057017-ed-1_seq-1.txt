arrived Tuesday with two cars of
live stock and household goods,
with the intention of finding
homes in this country. They
have rented the Mrs. Sallie
Hamilton house in the northwest
part of town, where they will
stop while looking around. They
had never been here before, but
from what they had heard from
people in whom they had confi
dence became so fully convinced
of the desirability of the Estan
cia valley that they decided to
save the expense of prospecting
trips. We hope they will find
something to suit and become
permanent residents.
The trees to be set out by the
village government, and also
trees for private persons in town
will be here shortly and will he
planted soon after arrival. This
should be a signal to everybody
interested in the looks of the
town to co-oprate in every way
possible with the village adminis
tration in protecting the trees
from damage and seeing that
they thrive. Particularly, pec-
pie who have live stock should
see that their stock does not get
loose, for trees cannot live where
there is loose stock. This should
be done voluntarily. - The vil
lage officers are showing a com
mendable spirit in their efforts
to beautify the town, and their
efforts should be cordially second
ed by the public. The officers
express the hope that no stock
will be allowed loose by the own
ers, but say that if it is, the or
dinance prohibiting the running
at large of live stock within the
village limits will be enforced to
the letter.

oe threshed out in the courts.
Ihere has been very little
weather to chronicle during the
month of March. It has been a
typical month for wind, there
having been 25 windy days.
However, the winds were not
nearly so violent as have been
witnessed here or have occurred
at other places durine this month
according to reports, and the
weather has been warm most of
the time and there has been no
severe cold. Mr. Stubblefield
broke his thermometer on the
17th, so there is no official tem
perature record since that Ante
The highest up to that time was
76 on the llth, and , the lowest
was but a few degrees below
freezing. There have been a
few colder nights since, "perhaps
making a mark of 20. There
was .10 of an inch of rain on the
22nd, and 1-2 inch of snow mak
ing .08 of an inch of moisture on
the 24th. As we go to press at
noon today a very wet snow is
falling that has reached a death
of about seven inches. The gov
ernment report for February
just out, shows between nine and
ten inches of snow during the
month at Rea's Ranch on Bosque
Mountain, being more than at
any other station in the state out
side of Rio Arriba county.

Since the year 1900 Geo. P.
Learnard has been established in
the piano business in Albuquer
que, and since that date has sold
more pianos to the people of
New Mexico than any other per
son in the state.
January 1, 1914, Mr. Learnard
conceived the idea that pianos
could be sold on a more satisfac
tory basis to both the purchaser
and himself by eliminating the
big items of store rent, partner
ship affairs, clerk hire and other
incidental expenses. Since that
date every piano purchaser has
shared in the saving of expenses.
All pianos are shipped direct from
the factory to purchaser, and Mr.
Learnard, accompanied by Mr.
Leon R. Allen,' Piano Tuner, now
travels overland continually and
calls personally on anyone who
desires information about pianos
and players, and especially those
who may be desirous of learning
about his new and successful
selling plans.
When you K ecome interested in
purchasing a piano write to Mr.
Geo. P. Learnard personally and
you will receive a prompt reply
and the satisfaction that you
desire when you place your
hard earned dollars in the pur
chase of a piano for your home
and little ones. Mail this today.
Mark a x below opposite that
in which you are intrested.
