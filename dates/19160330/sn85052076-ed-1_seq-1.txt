Give the Boys and Girls a Chance.
Boys and girls ought to have something of their own
on the farm. Give the boy an acre of land and let him
line up with the corn club boys under the direction of
your County Agent. Let him have all he can raise on it.
Give the girl a pig and encourage her to join the pig
club. Help get the boys and girls interested in poultry
and line them up with the poultry club. Let them have
all they can make.
While they are earning they are learning.
Get in touch with your County Agent and let him
help you get the children started.
The Living Gospel
Sermon by Rev. Win. E. Barton, D.D., at Union Church,
Sunday. March 26
Text: "But now when Tlmotheus
came from you unto ua, and brol
good tldlngt of your faith and char
ity, and that ye have good remem
brance of ua always, desiring great
ly to see us, as e also to see you."
I Thes. 3 8.
Our Interest in this passage Is In
stantly awakened when we know
that the phrase "brought good lid
Inn," an expression which In our
translation requires both a verb
and a noun, is in the Greek the verb
"evangtdiie'W the jword Tepeatedly
translated "preach the gospel." This
Is a singular, if not a unique use of
a very familiar New Testament
term. What was the gospel which
Timothy had Just been preaching to
Paul? It was the good newa that
the converts in Thessalonica were
standing fast in their faith in Ood
and their love for Paul. He had
been anxious and distressed for fear
that they had forgotten him and his
message. He had been waiting in
Corinth in grave uncertainty and
with many misgivings. He had
even been in doubt in what form ha
should present his message that it
might win soul on European soil.
Now when Timothy came to him and
assured him that his converts were
faithful, he counted it a veritable
evangel "for now we live if ye stand
fast in the Lord."
It would be easy to dismiss this
verse with the trite remark that in
asmuch as the word here used was
applicable to any good news and on
ly our specialized employment of the
term In connection with the tidings
of our Lord Jesus made that con
notation the primary one for us, we
need not be surprised if occasionally
we found the word in its ordinary
and secular sense.
Hut such a reflection does not dis.

The Socialists of Europe are

Among other things the use of the
railroads for the transportation cf
supplies and troops is granted. This
will be a great advantage. If the ex
