Washington, March 30.—The United

every means at its hands to receive
conclusive proof regarding the dis
aster which has overtaken the Sussex
and other ships carry American cltl
sens,' v../- .. ...
All reports Indicate that these ships
were torpedoed without warning and
that Germany has undertaken an
underseas campaign-in violation of as
surances of the United States.
Some officials believe German com
in-
strUctlohs such as were advocated by
Adnqiral von Tlrpitz, to torpedo every
vessel approaching the British Isles.
Some' officials believe that com
manders of German submarines have
orders other than those of which this
country has 1een advised.
Germany's Word Discredited.
TJoless Germany makes some state
ment in reply to- inquiries made by
this country to- cause the etate depart
ment- to change its present intentions,
all recent aggrevatlng Incidents will be
combined into' one general indictment
which will make the issue clearcut.
Should Germany disclaim responsi

States will continue the investigation.
If »?oof Ms secured that the ships
were torpedoed without- warning the
United States probably would act
promptly.
