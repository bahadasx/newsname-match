City over the submission of the sa

new angle with the refusal of City
Clerk P. W. Margin to accepj, for
filing the nomination papers of A.
B. Cownie, liberal candidate for

ing on the advice I City Attorney
Ward Evans, has informed Mr.

wets assert that the city attorney's
ruling isat fault,and that filing of
papers ten days prior to .the election
isjegdl Tire new primaryilaw- was
passed by 'the, last legislature and
never lias been tested. While no
program Jiasbeendecided upon by
the liberals, it' is possible .that the

to the district court on a mandamus
action, similar to that followed in
the case in regard to the saloon pe

secretary at the Pacific hotel, 'and
arrange for all admissions connected
in any way with the' association.'
The State Department of Publip In
struction has. been ableHhuB far this
ye.ar-to get along .without an extra
examination. It has. 'been'found ,
however, that manv teachers hold
ing city state certificates will need'
an additional opportunity to renew
their certificates or to secure ad
vanced certificates. On Saturday
April 15th will occur a special ex
amination in all subjects, one day
only. .The regular Friday's subjects
will be.given on Saturday forenoon,
and the regular Saturday's subjects
will be offered bn Saturday after
noon., .Teachers. should not let this
opportunity p'ass without at least
writing on one required subject.
Here is an important change to
note for all interested in the coming
eighth grade examination. The ex
amination dates have been changed
from 'April G and 7 to April 13 and
14. The new dates were made ne
cessary because the former ones con
flicted with the dates of two district
education associations. The State
Superintendent has announced this
change to better accommodate all
concerned.
'' The State Superintendent and
Governor are asking that , emphasis
be placed on the studv of Nebraska
'food'productsxluring.the week be
ginning April 3rd. This request has
ttimely merit in it. Let us set our
selves in active accord with it. Even
theteachors examinations, and the
eighth garde' examinations show the
need of giving more time and ear
nest consideration to the study of
our food products.' .
Superintendent Thomas says:
"The production of food is the most
elemental and most important oc
cupation among men, and happy la the
state whose basic occupation is food
producing. We have a plain, open,
agricultural country: a nlain. honest
and prosp ous'p'eople; few indigent
