There is gloom throughout the par
ish of Sacred Heart church, as It has
been definitely announced that the
pastor, xtev. Father McMillan, 8. J.,
Is to leave. This follows the action
of his order, the Society ot Jesus, in
tendering the Klamath county dis
trict to the Bishop of Eastern Oregon,
and hereafter the Klamath county
parishes will be conducted by tho dlo
ceslan clergy. .
Father McMillan leaves Wednesday
for Montana, to take charge of the
St. Ignatius mission among the Flat
head Indians, where he worked with
splendid success for ten years. His
successor, Rev. Hugh J. Marshall, ar
rives tonight from Heppner.
In the five years he has been in
charge ot the Klaamth Falls and Mer
rill parishes, Father McMillan has
brought about many big Improve
ments, not only Improving the church
buildings, but making considerable
j additions to the congregational aa
well by means of his earnest work.
He has brought the membership of
the local church much closer together
and he leaves the parish affairs In far
better shape than they were when he
came here.
Prior .to coming to Klamath rails,
Rev. McMillan waa treasurer ot
Santa Clara University tor several
years. He made hosta of friends In
Klamath county, both Inside and out
lde of church circles, and his regret
at leaving Klamath la no .greater
than tha regret local people feel re
garding bis departure.
