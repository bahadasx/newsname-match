iy Hie county loeatVthe
tnfiuiii had fiII6d toayree on a site af
ter having hadtwoorthree offered they
began to suggest to each other that a
1 asper location Would solve the problem
A meeting was hurriedly called at The
Xcwsoffice by President Huylettund
u committee sent to Carthage Carter
ille Webb City and Joplin Monday
morning to intefvlow the commission
on the subject
The commission with power to select
a site for the sanitarium is as follows
Judge Howard Gray Carthage Miss
Bess HacUett Carlerville Dr Cheno
wolh Webb City A II Waiteand
Mrs C C Cuinmlngs of Joplin
The Jasper committee saw all mem
bers of the commission but Mr Walle
who was out of thecity The committee
alo interviewed mnrjy private citienu
public ofdeialii ami the newspapers
Dr J J Martin acted as spolcesniau
for the committee on its visits to mem
bers of thticommission and very nicely
and compleletly presented Jaspers
claims
Both the ladies and gentlemen on
the commission treated the Jasper
committee with every courtesy and
while they made us no promises except
to postpone their meeting appointed
for tonight Thursday and visit Jas
per and the sites proposed here before
taking a final vote on the matter the
committee was convinced that Judgo
Gray Miss Hockett Dr Chenoweth
and Mrs Cummings are inspired by
the highest motives in their considera
tion of the location of the sanitarium
Judge dray promised to give our
claims earnest consideration Miss
Iluckett very readily admitted that she
had no previously thought of Jasper
but recognized the advantages of a
community farther away from the
mines than the sitesi previously pro
posed Khe gladly consented to visit
Jasper before the site was selected if
Thursday nights meeting could be
postponed
Dr Chenoweth a very busy man
courteously granted the committee
ample time to present our claims He
was frank even blunt but UieDo6tor
evidently wants to do the very best
thing for the sanitarium and the un
fortunates who shall occupy it He
too agreed to come to Jasper
Mrs C C Cummings the last mem
ber of the commission seen received
the committee in the office of her
husband Dr Cummings She seemed
very willing to listen to the committee
She said that none of the other sites
particularly appealed to her and she
readily agreed to a trip to Jasper if the
aforesaid meeting could be postponed
Mr Hayzlett and A F Drake called
on Frank Yale secretary of the Joplin
Commercial Club Mr Yale said
Why Joplin dont care for the insti
tution being tere Wfthavo always
inougui mat it might be well to locate
it entirely away from the mining dis
trict
AJ a all the committee felt more
and more encouraged the farther they
Went and they returned Monday night
weary from the days wcrk but deter
mined to push this tothelast ditch
and put Jasper on the map right

culosis Sanitarium should be located
at Jarper for the following reasons
1 Sites to be obtained near Jasucr
are ideal in many ways and are equal
in every essential respect to any other
sites proposed
2 The country is hism and
ful the air pure surroundings beauti
ful the water unexcelled
i Jnsper is far enough removed from
the mines and their impure gases and
fumes to insure the safety of the pa
tients and yet near enough that their
friends may visit them conveniently
and often
J Jasper is on the Joplin branch of
the Missouri 1acllic and the Jefferson
Highway the latter being now under
construction from the baseline noilh
5 The sanitarium would be of little
value to its surrounding or to Joplin or
Webb City iLlocited there but it would
bcof inestimable value to this section
of the country
j Fresh proUsions and dairy pro
ducts could be delivered at the sanita
rium every morning and in any quan
tity by the producers themsehes thus
avoiding extra handling and shipping
which always depreciates the quality of
vegetables fruits and milk
7 The annoyance and danger inci
dent to the
continual blastingand con
cussion about the mines and the oc
casional explosions at the powder mills
would bo eliminated by locating at
Jasper
The Josper men assured everybody
they saw that Jasper would furnish a
suitable and ample site for the location
of the sanitarium and strongly urged
their claim that this section of the
county is more suited to its location
first and foremost because this is a
more healthful and a more beautiful
section
