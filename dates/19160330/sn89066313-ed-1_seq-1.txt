Husiness Men at Luncheon
1 lear of Plans for the
Annual Exhibition.
51,600 PLEDGE ASKED
Guaranty Is Sought to Pro
tect Students From Loss
bv Bad Weather.
The amnuil Commencement Week
Horse Show given by the College of
Agriculture is probably the only such
show in the world and is the only
I'uhersity commencement activity in
which Columbia people are called up
on to take a financial part, Dean P.
15. Jlumford told the Commercial Club
at its weekly luncheon at the Harris
Cafe today.
The horse show this vear will be
advertised on a broader scale than
heretofore, and more entries arc ex
pected. Columbia people will be ask
ed to subscribe a $1,000 guaranty fund
to protect the students against loss
in case of bad weather. A similar
guaranty was made last year and the
year before, but no guarantors had
to pay their pledges. More than $900
of the fund this year has been sub
scribed. The rest will be raised in a
few weeks.
Hen Colman, an agricultural stu
dent, said more local entries were
wanted in the show.
"This is not a purely University
stunt but is a IJoonc County and Co
lumbia undertaking," he said. "Sc
want to get more people of the county
interested."
Prof. 11 A. Trowbridge said the
quality of this horse show was well
established and the horsemen over the
state were willing to back the under
taking financially, if necessary to con
tinue it.
L. JI. Defoe, president of the club,
said people were brought to Colum
bia and to the University by the horse
show who were not reached by any
other activities.
"As the University grows larger it
is harder to get the county and the
school together," he said. "I remarked
at the horse show last year that there
were more people of Boone County
interested in this undertaking than I
had ever before seen interested in
University affairs."
W. II. Thomson of the county fair
board said the people over the state
were interested in the show.
"I saw one man watching the horse
exhibits last year while his daughter
was in the auditorium receiving her
graduation diploma."

American troops 300 miles in the in
terior of Mexico and witli 10,000 men
to be supplied witli food and munitions,

can-Xorthwestern Hailroad will not be
able to move munitions from the
American bases into the interior until
Saturday,. on account of lack of equip
ment. It is thought that perhaps no culi
tary guard will be sent to accompany

WASHINGTON', .March 30. A com
plete backdown upon the part of the

letter Men Pass Resolutions to Present
to Committer.
The M Men's Association of the Uni
versity yesterday afternoon passed
resolutions to be presented to the
Athletic Committee requesting that in
the future the block JI be awarded
only in tlie live major sports. These
are football, baseball, track (including
cross-country), basketball and ttainis.
In these sports the block JI would be
awarded only to the men who earned
it in Jlissouri Valley or similar com
petition. In other cases some other
style of JI would be awarded with let
ters indicating the sport.
In the past, the Tdock JI has been
given to members of some teams be
fore they had really earned it, accord
ing to some of tlie JI men. The resolu
tions hold that tlie block JI, as the
insignia of the University, should be
awarded only to the men who earn it
in unusual competition.
In tennis a man must finish first in
the Jlissouri Valley tournament, to
win the M's in cross country lie must
finish among the first third of the en

been awarded and very few cross
country JI's.
