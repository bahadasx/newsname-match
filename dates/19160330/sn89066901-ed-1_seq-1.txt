HE IS A BUSY MAN
Prof. W. H. Lynch, Visitor
of the Springfield State
Normal, a Worker
Prof.W H Lynch, visitor of the
Springfield State Ntrmal.and one
of Missouri's most popular and
best known educators, was here
Monday evening. He had intend
ed visiting the schools here and
at Hartville, but while at Ava,
where he attended the third an
nual school board convention of
Douglas county, he received a
message calling him to Stockton.
He spoke at Ava Friday evening,
at a mass meeting in the interest
of a new school building at that
place, Monday he visited the
Ava school, which he says is one
of the best in theOsarks. He
reports a fine trip and an urgent
request for a return call. In fact,
he is requested to return to ev
ery place he visits for his very
presence is an inspiration.
The professor spoke on "The
Community -High School" at
Bronaugh during the campaign
for the formation of a consolidat
ed high school district at the
Vernon county town, and the fact
that the proposition carried is
highly gratifying to him.
Friday's Springfield Republi
can says; "Prof. Lynch only this
week returned from a month's
trip to points in. Southwest Mis
souri, where he visited schools
and gave addresses in the inter
est of the normal school. He left
here Feb. 18, going to Bronaugh,
Vernon county, where he ad
dressed a mass meeting in sup
port of a proposal to form a con
solidated high school district.
From there he went to Jasper
county where he spent two weeks
visiting the. schools in towns of
that county. The high schools
visited were at -Joplin, Oronogo,
Alba, Carthago, Webb City, Car
terville, Sarcoxie and Jasper.
Going to Barry county he visited
the schools at Wheatland, Cass
ville, Exeter and Purdy. Schools
at Neosho, Seneca and Fairview
in Newton county also were visit
ed and addresses given before
the teachers and students, In
speaking of his trip. Prof. Lynch
spoke highly of the progress be
ing made in all the high schools
he visited. 'A noticeable feature
in the schools is the display of
the United States flag, 'said Prof.
Lynch yesterday. 'Patriotism
seems to be walking hand in hand
with the progress that education
is making in Southwest Missouri.
It also is apparent that many of
the schools are scarcely large e
nough to accommodate the child
ren in the districts they serve,
which to me is indicative that
more children in Missouri are
now receiving the advantages of
education than ever before. The
parents are waking up to the fact
that for a better civilization there
must be a better trained citizen
ship and even the poorest class is
seeing that the children get pres
ent day advantages that were de
nied their parents in oilier days.' "
Prof. Lynch attended the last
annual meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement
of Science and of the Ohio State
Teachers' Association at Colum
bus, Ohio, concerning which the
Columbus Dispatch said: "Here
you are, face to face with the man
who became famous among edu
cators the world over, because
for 40 years he regularly used
newspapers, one day each week,
instead of text books, in the
schools over which he presided
in Southern Missouri. He is
William H. Lynch, who now at the
age of 76 years is field agent for
t.ho atat.fi normal school at
Springfield, and is known as the
most popular teacher in his state
of former days, He has been for
years a regular subscriber for
118 different newspapers and va
rious clipping agencies, and he
claims that the papers which he
furnished to his pupils have
proved a most potent force in his
sT-tPin of instruction. His idea
is well embodied in these quota
tionsfrom the many published
expressions on the subject: 'Any
body who can read the Lord's
prayer should take his home pa
per. I believe the reading of the
news of your own neighborhood,
as well as that of the world at
large, is one of the primary re
quirements of an educated man
or woman.' 'The newspapers and
the public schools are the uni
versities of the people.' 'If I were
blind and deaf and could not read
I would take a newspaper and
bave it thrown at my gate, so
that the people passing my home
would say, 'There is one person
who is interested in the welfare
and upbuilding of his own com
munity.' Besides this, Mr.Lynch
bas another hobby good roads.
'Good schools, good newspapers,
and good roads,' he says, 'mean a
country that will always stand
first among the nations of the
world. ' Mr. Lynch is one of the
many interesting characters a
mong the educators attending
the meetings of the Science As
sociation in Columbus during the
past week. He is a veteran of the
Civil War, and, although he was
born in the Ozarks, he marched
with Sherman to the sea. He is
an admirer of Ohio, its education
al institutions and school system
but, best of all, he is a thorough
optimist and a firm believer in
the application of practical things
in the teaching and development
of school youth."
On the back of the professor's
card is the following verse: "The
Way to Live. I would be true, for
there are those who trust me; I
would be pure, for there are
those who care; I would be
strong, for there is much to suf
fer; I would be brave, for there
is much to dare; I would be
friend to all the poor and friend
less; I would be giver, and forget
the gift; I would be humble, for I
know my weakness; I would look
up and love and laugh and lift."

WHY NOT 4 YEARS?
Mansfield Should Have ' a
First-Class High School
Educational Items
When in Mansfield to have a 4-
year high school:1 Mountain
Grove is forging ahead because
her people are willing to increase
the levy for school purposes; Ava
is to be in the first class because
her taxpayers ase willing to fur
nish the money for maintenance
and to erect a new buildings.
Are the children in these towns
entitled to better things than
those in Mansfield are? If so,
why?
The following students consti
tute the senior class of 1916:
Mintie Avery, Cecil Brazeal, Ma
bel Coday, Minnie Dennis, Opal
and Mabel Hoover, Wade Rippee
and Alice Tombleson. If nothing
unforeseen occurs to prevent it,
these students will finish credita
bly our full high school course,
with credit for 12 units of ap
proved work. Their work this
year has been excellent and they
will reflect credit on our school
as members of the alumni. The
only regret is that they cannot
have next year an opportunity to
do still another year's work with
out the expense and worry of
having to go away from home to
get it
The contestants are getting
down to real work on their decla
mations for the preliminary con
test next month. The winner
here will represent the Mansfield
school in the inter-high school
contest at Springfield the last of
April. Our contestant last year,
Miss Bertha Miller, brought
home the prize and we hope to
equal the record this time, We
hope everyone in school and out
will encourage and assist our
speakers in every possible way.
You can help. We can win again
f you do
There are 20 members of the
sophomore class who will be able
to make passing grades, provided
each one keeps up his attendance
and does all the work prescribed.
That would be a fine crowd of
young people for next year's
tenth grade and it is to be hoped
that no parent will allow any
child to miss school and so fail of
promotion, especially members
of the sophomore class.
On account of the change of
teachers in the grammar depart
ment and the fact that many of
the mothers could not attend on
account of the bazaar and dinner
to be given by the M.E. Aid Soci
ety, the patrons meeting has
been postponed for a week
The juniors are finishing Book
1 in their geometry this week.
After a test on this book, they
will begin on Book 2 with the in
tention of completing it by the
close of school. This class is small
but every member of it is doing
excellent work.

Saturday but, not having made

as much review work as possible
especially with those who have
been absent on account of sick
ness or other reasons that are
good ones.
Miss Osborn spent the week
end at her home in Springfield
and saw the ''Garden of Allah"
Sunday evening. We hope to
have her tell us of it soon.
