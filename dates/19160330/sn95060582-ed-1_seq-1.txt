Editor Herald-News,
St. Johns, Arizona.
Dear Sir: The former Texans
of Arizona will hold their annual
San Jacinto Day celebration at
McNeal, Arizona, Saturday, April
22nd. Doubtless many, of your
readersare "Texican's" and we
desire to extend to them, through
the' columns of your paper a cor
dial invitation to be present and
meet their old friends from the
Lone Star State and hear once
more their "Mother tongue" just
as she is "spoke" back on the
Trinity and Brazos.
There will be a prize for the
best composition on "Texas"
written by a school child under
sixteen and the speakers will in
clude Gov. .Hunt, Hon. Tom W.
Nealson, of Fhcenix and Hon.
Dan M. Jackson of El Paso. The
foimer need no introduction in
Arizona. The latter, Judge Dan
M. Jackson is District Judge at
El Paso and is one of the most
noted speakers in Texas, being
famous throughout the state for
his brilliant oratory. His ad
dress at the State Bar Associa
tion recently at Dallas, was the
sensation of the meeting.
There will be fancy roping and
riding and other sports and a
general good time for all. We
expect to have the First Cavalry
Concert Band, which played, a
year at the San Francisco Fair.
We are endeavoring to obtain low
railroad rates but can make no
definate announcement regarding
this at the-present time. "Texi
cans" are expected to be present
or offer a legal excuse for ab
sence. All other nationalities are
invited as guests and will be made
welcome.
If some of your readers will
take the trouble to send me a list
of their friends' who formerly
lived in Texas 1 shall be glad to
send detailed information to each
one. My address is Douglas,

Mormons Can Now Talk.
Some trouble has been going on
between the city authorities of
Norfolk, Va., and Mormon mis
sionaries, in regard to the latter
preaching on the streets of that
town. However; it seems that the
matter was satisfactorily settled
to all concerned, as will be seen
by the following from a Norfolk
paper:
Provided they confine their
nieeting to Commercial- -Place
south of the monument, and that
traffic is not disturbed. Mormon
Elders Shumway and West were
today given permission to preach
by the Board of Control. No
collections are to be taken "up.

Tuxedo Nights
by Walt Mason
When the day's work's done, and the good old sun
has sunk in the well known West, then I stretch my
form by the fireside warm, I sit at my ease and rest.
Then I take my pipe which is mildly ripe, as the pipes
of good smokers are, with a chortling soul then I fill
its bowl from my glass Tuxedo jar. And I smoke at
ease, and my trouble flees to
the place where dead troubles
go; and my worries seem, in
my waking dream no longer to
have a show. And I say, "In
deed, it's a noble weed that
drives all the ghosts away, and
clamps the lid on the cares
that skid around through the
busy day. The worries and
t ii. .1
woes and such things as those
in the daytime leave their scar, but there's rest at
night and a calm delij; t in my
glass Tuxedo jar."
