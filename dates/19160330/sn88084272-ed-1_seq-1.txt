Unions Say They Have No
Intention of Talking Stride
Or Giving Uulimaium.
NEW YORK, March 30. The de
mands of nearly 400,009 locomo
tive engineers, firemen, and
conductors and brakemen were pre
sented to the general managers of the
several railroad companies involved at
their headquarters in different parts of
the country today. The employes, who
belong to the so-called Big Four
unions, ask for an eight hour day with
out reduction in pay and time and a
half for overtime. The railroads have
until April 29 to reply.
It is understood that the railroads
already have made ready a tentative
answer which amounts to a conditional
refusal that leaves the way open for
further negotiations. The demands of
the men went to the Wheeling and
Lake Erie railroad yesterday and the
eight hou,r proposal was refuged,
Unions Hxplsln Position.
The position of tli unlaw is u
plained in a statement by the execu
tive committee of the adjustment
boards, which has charge of the sub
mission of the demands today. The
statement says:
"lu making the demand for an eight J
hour day, the unions feel themselves I
justified, believing that trains can be
so managed that the 100 miles required
of a railroad per day can be put inside
of eight hours. .-48 the train service
is now, single crow engines in the
switching service, on which only one
crew works In the 24 hours, are ofteen
compelled to work from ten to 16 hours
a day. It Is injustice such as this that
the railway unions want ended.
Will Work for :tO Days.
"We will submit our demands all
over the United States. Then we will
attend to our regular ' routine work
until the end of 30 days given the
railroads to consider our demands,
when we will return to receive the re
ply of the railroad companies. We will
ask the general managers to discuss
the demands through their general
managers' committees. Our desire is
to open negotiations with the railroads
in ouy demands, and we have no in
tention of talking strike to the rail
roads or submitting an ultimatum."
Meeting Are Arranged.
Arrangements already have been
made here for a meeting of represent
atives of the employes and managers
of the Erie, the New Jersey Central
and the New York Central railroads to
day. Railroads Submit Proposal.
Eastern railroad managers replied to
the demands by submitting proposi
tions of their own for discussion. The
demands of the employes are not re
fused. "What the railways want is an open
door," their reply state.
The reply was sent today .to the of

diately after receipt of the employes'
demands.

"Scouts from '.advanced points have

indicates that the Crrranxa troops are
carrying out the promise of cooperation
fully. Two miles of motor trucks ar
rived here oday (Wednesday) "
The name of the town from which the
message was sent was not given in the
radiogram but It ia believed that it was

town of Guerrero. This information
was. received by the military authori
ties in Juarez.
As the Villlstas moved south along
the line of the Mexico North

heart of the Guerrero country with
his men.

days ago. Gen. Herrera, who recently
was reported to have rebelled against
Carranza, went from Chihuahua city to
Queretaro to talk to Carranza about
securing more supplies for his forces
in Chihuahua, Davila said.
The only dispatches received at head
quarters from Gen Pershing today
dealt w 1th routine nutters.
cles that further negotiations might re

without serious delay, the base a'
tolumbus will be moved to 1 I'aso.
It was indicated at Gen. Funston
headquarters that the use of th.
Juarez-Chihuahua line of the National
Kailways (Mexican Central) would be
asked for, if the bad condition of the
North Western made it impossible to
handle supplies regularly, or if the
altered positions of the cavalry and
supporting lines engaged in the pursuit
of Francisco Villa made advisable the
use of a shorter and more direct route.
It was suggested that if Carranza di.l
not object to the use of the North
Western, he probably would not object
to the use of the other line.
