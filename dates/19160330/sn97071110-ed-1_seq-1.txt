On reaching noma we found every
thing in commotion. The Indians! had
gathered in for council and were evi
dently much excited. The parties who
were signaling across the river in the
morning proved to be a buck and his
squaw who had been held as prisoners
by Sbowouwai, a brother of Kamiaken,
because he had refused to let the chief
have a rifle to which he had taken a
fancy. They had been seven days
coming from the Simcoe reservation
and had experienced fearful hardshsips
on the way over from hunger and fa
tigue; having come nearly all the way
through snow, in some places many
feet deep. They brought news that the
bos tiles were to start so as to reach
the Cascades the very day tbey had
reached the river. They had strained
every nerve in order to reach us sooner
and give the alarm, but were too late.
My brother. Eugene, immediately
started for the landing to intercept the
little steamer Mary, which was then
coming in sight, and communicate the
news to them. Their reply sent a thrill
of terror through every heart. Tbey
themelvess had been in the fight and
had by the greatest chance, barely es
caped with their lives, and some bad
been seriously if not mortally wounded,
and were then on board. Their advice
was for us to flyjwith our lives, as in
all probabiltiy every soul at the Cas
cades would be killed, as the woods
were full of Indians. About sundown
a courier arrived, bringing the news
that Bradford's store, where all the
whites at the Upper Cascades were
congregated, had been captured, as the
Indians could be seen carrying flour
and other things out of it. (Ibis was
mistake as it was the Bush bouse
which had been abandoned and was af
terward looted by the Indians.
A council was at once called. Indians
included. They on ther part promised
to station guards all along the river
and to send couriers to the Cascades.
and this promise was faithfully exe
cuted. After they bad gone it was
unanimously decided that we should at
all hazards attempt to reach The
Dalles. We had all confidence in the
Klickitats; they had been proven, but
were satisfied the others could not be
trusted. Our only route was by the
river, and the craft a large Chinook
canoe which had been bid in the brush
near where the present wagon bridge
crosses Mood river, and was owned by
an old Indian named Waucusba. Ibis
canoe was an exceptionally fine ono,
capable of carrying 30 or 40 passengers.
At about miunigbt the entire white
population of Hood River left tbeir
homes and marched in single file to the
river, where we met the canoe and
started on our lonely journey. As we
quietly paddled our canoe through the
silent water we beard the Indian
guards signaling along the shore from
one to another until far up and down
the river came the answering calls.
We had been discovered, and in less
time than it takes to read it. every
camp had been appraised of our flight
About noon the next day, when near
the Klickitat river, we met both little
steamers, Mary and Wasco, fairly blue
with soldiers, and loaded to the guards
with cavalry and munitions of war, on
their way to the reliei of the Cascades.
They stopped as they name to us, in
quiring for news. We gave them what
we had heard lrom the courier the
night before, and tbey hurried on. How
their polished rifles and bayonets
gleamed and shimmered in that noon
day sun ! and their clanking sabers
made sweet music to our care-worn
ears. How tierce and brave and good
they looked! Ohl would they be in
time? About 3 o'clock we reached
The Dalles, where almost the entire
population turned out to meet us, in
quiring for news. And there our jour
ney ended.
I cannot close this article without a
tribute of praise tolthose true and loyal
Klickitats, who so bravely stood by the
whites in that trying year. Truer
hearted men never lived. Tried by the
test of battle, tbey proved themselves
men even though their hearts beat un
der a dusky skin. They have nearly
all passed over to their happy bunting
grounds, and scarcely a remnant of
their race remains. Among the most
prominent of them were JohnBon, (jue
umps, Yallup, Snataps and Johnnie.
There were others that I cannot call
to memory. Among the Hood River
Indiana only two or three remain old
John blibender and Charley Copiax,
and both were unwavering in fealty to
the whites. There is still another,
whose character.as a friend to the pale
face is open .to serious doubts. His
own admission places him in the right
against Major Haller on isimcoe moun
tains, uy the evidence of an others,
his hand applied tbe torch Jthat fired
the Joslyn bouses, and by implication
that same right hand was crimsoned
with the blood of innocents at tbe Cas
cade massacre. I refer to old White
Salmon Dave, a notorious beggar and
a would be pensioner of Bro. John
Cradlebaugh.
I here is also a scrap of unwritten
history concerning the plans of thst
wily old chief, Kamiaken. He had de
cided upon war, and his plan was first
to capture the cascades, then leaving
sufficient force to hold that place, come
up toe river and attack the uanea,
compelling all Indians to join him.
And there is no doubt in my mind thst,
with few exceptions, all the tribes
would have joined his standard. From
The Dalles the movement waa to con
tinue eastward until the entire country
east of tbe Cascades was clear of
whites. Tbe campaign waa well planned
but poorly executed. All that saved
the Cascades, however, waa a very for
tunate accident, one of those happen
ings which seems to be the direct woric
of Providence. A large body of United
States troops was on its wsy to. the
eastern part of the teritory, and Kami'
aken was fully intormed ss to the in
tentions of tbe troops. Couriers on
fleet horses waited the movement of
the troops, and on tbeir departure from
The Dallea the horses of tbe couriers
were urged at their utmost apeed to
Kamiaken's camp, who at once started
his wsiriors for the Cascades. But tbe
troops only made a three mile march
and went into camp to'await the ar
rival of arms and ammunition 'which
had been detained at the Cascade port
age, and were to have been shipped by
the steamer tbe very day of the at
tack. So the detention not only furn
ished those in Bradford's store with an
abundance of arms and ammunition,
but detained tbe troops within easy
rescb of the boats. This information
regarding Kamiaken all came through
the Indians who bad escaped from
Chief Showouwai's clutches.
But my stor5must close. You who
are now scattered througout the length
and breaotb of this beautiful valley
can but little realise the situation then
or the constant fear that for over a
year was in every breast It scams to
me now more like a dream than a reality.
GROWERS VOTE ON
MEASURES SATURDAY
At the annual meeting of tbe Apple
Growers Association, to be held next
Saturday, when a board of directors of
11 will be elected, the two meet impor
tant measures to be voted on by the
members of the organisation which
controls the majority of the fruit ton
nage of the valley, will be those per
taining to an affiliatioa with the Fruit
Growers' Agency, incorporated, as for
mally organised last week in Spokane,
and the matter of levying an assess
ment of a cent per package on all fruit
products bandied by the organization,
the money so secured to form an auxil
iary fund to be used in financing grow
ers in reed st harvest time and to pur
chase supplies.
Sentiment expressed by grower mem
bers points to an alliance with the cen
tral agency, proposed by the Office of
Markets of the United States Depart
ment of Agriculture and an adoption of
the auxiliary fund system.
P. S. Davidson, who represented the
Association at the Spokane meeting,
has returned. He declares that the
central agency as organized seems to
meet with favor of all fruit districts.
"If tbe growers," says Mr. David
son, "are willing to give the plans the
same consideration of tbeir shipping
organizations, tbe Fruit Growers'
Agency, Incorporated, will be of great
benfit, since it will enable us as a
whole to accomplish many things, the
collecting of reliable information
among them, that have.bcen prohibitive
because of the cost to the individual
selling organisation."
Officers elected last week were as
follows:
President Paul U. Weyrauch, Walla
Walla.
Vice President J. B. Adams, Leav
enworth. Secretary-treasurer (temporarily)
P. R. Parks, Spokane.

HIGH SCHOOL PLAY
DECIDED SUCCESS
"Sylvia." the best mid-year play the
high school has ever presented, was
greeted with a large attendance at the
Monroe opera house last Friday night.
The high school is fortunate in having
so many singers in their number,
which is about 200. One eighth of the
population of the school was ueed in
persenting this light opera.
Miss Lillian Brock, the leading lady,
in "Lady Nancy" last year, played the
part of Sylvia very well.-Sylvia was
a court lady who was tired of all the
pomp and ceremony, and more especi
ally of the attentions of the poet. Sir
Bertram de Lacey.
Miss Ruth Berry was very successful
in plsying the part of Betty, a country
lass, who had tired of William, her
country beau, whose rough wsys did
not sltogether appeal to her. Sylvia
and Betty changed places, each receiv
ing the attentions of the other's lover,
for a day, only to turn back in realiza
tion of their mistake.
Malcolm Button portrayed the part
of de Lacey, a love-sick poet, very
creditably, and Jack Stanton that of
William, the farmer boy. Some of
Jack's line's were very similar to those
used when he expresses himself in
every day life, making the play more
realistic and comical.
Allan Button played the part of
Prince Tobbytum. Allan is naturally a
handsome lad,' and when dressed up as
a prince, monocle and all, he must be
given praise for bis characterization,
singing, etc.
'1 he chorus, made up of 20 boys and
girls, must credit much of its success
to the actions of Paul Lancaster, who
was supposed to be a simple farmer
boy, and very simple for a fsrmer boy
at that. Mr. Lancaster will take the
leading part in the senior class play
this year.
The girls in the chorus were Ruth
Nicholson, Irma Boyce, Constance
Smith, Marie Bartmess, Hilma lmholz,
Katherine M. Baker, Sarah Howes,
Frances Littlefleld, Elda Jackson and
Ruth Howell. The boya were Cecil
Latferty, Leonard Howard, Lowell
Nickelsen, Paul Lancaster, Solon Dob
son, Lester Fisher, Charles Johnson,
Lee Spaulding and Sidney Carnine.
PHILADELPHIAN
WANTS THE BEST
Because of advertising that has been
waged by the Apple Growers Associa
tion the past several years in exploita
tion of its brands, Blue and Red Dia
mond, the identity of the selling organ
ization has been dimmed, according to
wilmer Sieg. Monday Mr. Sieg re
ceived a letter from a Philadlphia gro
cery Arm, addressed to "The Blue Dia
mond Apple Co., Hood River, Ore.
"Before Christmas," wrote the Pbil
adelhia grocerymen. "we purchased
through a local broker some of your
Blue Diamond Spitzenburgs. .Several
times since we hsve tried to buy them,
but hsve always been offered other
brands 'just aa good' that were not fit
to eat If anybody in Philadelphia is
handling your fruit please let me know"
EXCHANGE HOUli
ANNUALMEETING
TWO MORE DIRECTORS ARE NAMED
Gwin Suggests Central System of Packing-McKay
in Report Urges
Growers to Kill Fungus
Directors of the Fruit Growers' Ex
change for the ensuing year were
elected as follows: E. W. Sweeney,
E. E. Stanton, F. P. Friday, J. O.
Mark. Kenneth McKay, all re-elected;
W. R. Warner, 3rd, and O. M. Bailey.
Following the meeting of stockhold
ers the newly elected directors met and
renewed the contract with the North
western Fruit Exchange for the han
dling of the 1916 crops.
W. F. Gwin, manager of the central
organization, who with A. Prince, sec
retary, and Dr. tj. A. Macrum, of Mo
sier, state horticultural commissioner,
was here for the meeting, addressed
the growers, suggesting that they de
liver their frnit to their association at
tree-row ends, in case that roads pen
etrated the fields, in order that it might
be hauled with the quickest dispatch to
central packing houses and placed un
der refrigeration as soon as possible.
"After picking," said Mr. Gwin,
"apples should be under ice in 24
hours. Northwestern spple men hsve
been losing hundreds of thousands of
dollars each year because of inefficient
methods of handling their crops. Ap
ples have been allowed to become too '
ripe on the trees, and then after the
harvest have been allowed to remain
in ordinary packing houses, thus de
stroying their value and killing a de
mand on the market after the over
ripe Stock had once been handled by
the buyer."
Mr. Gwin suggested that the organ
ization award contracts for the trans
portation of the fruit from orchards to
central packing plants to motor truck
concerns of Portland.
In his address to growers, Mr. Gwin
told of the origin of the Skookum
brand of apples and the success of ad
vertising campaigns waged in New
York City. From a tonnage of 38,000
boxes three years ago, Skookum brand,
composed of commercial extra fancy
grade of eleven standard varieties,
grew last year to 190,000 boxes. Be
cause of the advertising campaigns,
$20,000 having been expended in the
three years, Mr. Gwin declared that
the brand Skookum had sold for at
least 25 cents per box more than any
other brand on the New York market.
"We picked New York city," said
Mr. Gwin, "as a place to experiment
and determine tbe value of distinctive
brand advertising. In the future we
plan to carry on campaign of national
advertising."
The tollowing is a part of tbe report
of Manager McKay :
Each year for the past few years has
showed up with new and peculiar con
ditions, and the season just closed was
no exception. To begin with, the crop
was decidedly short in the northweBt.
while the east was just a little less
than normal. The roiddla west, how
ever, including Nebraska, Iowa and
Illinois, showed up an exceedingly
heavy crop. Such was the size of the
apple crop. Let us now look at the
quality.
We already know that the large ab
normal crops raised each year in the
east, while mediocre and below our
northwest standard, nevertheless find a
popular market because of their cheap
ness, and cause the sale of our north
west apples many serious obstacles and
handicaps, the greatest of which is the
differential in freight, amounting to SO
cents per box. The seriousness of this
is felt, when very often these eastern
apples sell for just what our freight
amounts to. Uur only salvation, our
only chance of competing with the
east, is in quality, quality of product
and quality of package.
laking the northwest as a whole.
this past season, our quality was decid
edly below average. Never before were
worms so rampant in one section, a se
vere drought affected another section,
while here in Hood River we were con
fronted with the most serious and tbe
most damaging to tbe repuutation and
sale of our fruit, namely, scab.
While we have been affected more or
less by this pest in the past year or
two, never before did it show up as bad
as last year. Growers are not generally
to blame for this condition, ibese new
elements will arise, and have to be met
and eontrolled, and it is encouuraging
to note that the Hood Kiver grower is
entering the conflict armed fully with
tbe energy and animation that will as
suredly bring us relief.
The forcing of these fungus apples
on the trade is a process like pulling
teeth. While the apples are sound, the
appearance is decidedly against them,
and the fact of their creating an unfa
vorable impression was clearly shown
by receiving no repeat orders, and the
almost impossibility of selling to the
same man twice. These are just the re
verse of conditions that are wanted,
and we are putting these matters be
fore you, because this is your business
and you ought to know conditions as we
have faced them, and conditions we
can help to avoid in the future.
we cannot urge you too strongly to
cooperate with your state help, with
your organizations, with yourselves, in
the effort to rid our fruit of past handi
caps, land place it on the quality pinna
cle of the past.
Is it not tbe "used to be" we hsve
to deal with ss much as the "going to
bes?"
Tsking a review of the local organiz
ation since our last annual meeting, we
show a very substantial growth and a
much more solid footing.
At our last meeting we had 25 mem
bers. At this date we have 137 mem
bers, an increase of 546 per cent, which
we confidently expect to greatly in
crease before the coming season.
Despite the fact that the tonnage
from Hood River was about one-half of
1914, we have shipped this year 50,599
boxes against 53,829 boxes in 1914, a
differential of only 6 per cent, while
the valley's differential shows practi
cally 50 per cent
This splendid increase and grswth
shows the popularity among growers to
have an alternate in case of dissatisfac
tion, as it now recognized in Hood
River thst the past year has demon
strated s better service to every grower
thsn ever before.
Looking for a minute to the future,
our incressed strength will place us for
the first time on a really competitive
