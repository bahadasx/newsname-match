Mr. D. R. Coker, of Hartsville, who *
was present at the banquet last night,
invited the young farmers to visit
Hartsville when the South Carolina A
Plant Breeders' association meets
there in the near future. Mr. Coker,
who has done so much for the*agri- j
ad cultural interests of the State, es- f
pecially through the work of seed se- j
ns lection and plant breeding, told the ^
young farmers that he believed they
be could get some good points which f
or would be helpful to them, and he assured
them that he and the other
tt(* people of Hartsville "would give them
u" ,a cordial welcome. ^
-y- There were several ca?h prizes distributed
to winners last night, and ^
-P" Mr. Coker told the young farmers to '
re invest this money and make it earn ^
something. He suggested that they c
P~ might buy some calves and feed them
'm through the summer and market
them in the fall. Mr. Coker urged
Uy the young men to be business farm*r>
ers and to learn at this early stage
)e? in life the value of money and how
a* to handle it in a business way. ^

VILLA PRE PARI NG TO FI6HT
WILL KILL MEXICANS FRIENDLY
TO AMERICANS.
Believed Bandit Miscalculated When
He Predicted Raid Would Cause
Mexicans to Rise Against U. S.
Field Headquarters, American Expedition
Force, Colonia Dublan, Chihuahua,
Mexico, March 26.? (By
A arAnlono + 11 m Vin e XT A f Mn rnVi
vytuuv tv vuiuiiiuuo, ill , iviai Lll
27.)?Evidence that Villa is preparing
t<f resist the American pursuing
columns and that the Mexican people
are not as yet rallying to him has
been collected by the officers and
scouts of the American troops.
Officers who have ridden over the
various fronts in the State of Guerrero,
where Villa fled when the expedition
crossed the border, have
found numerous indications that Villa
miscalculated completely when he
predicted that his Columbus raid
would cause a general uprising
against Americans.
The status of the chase today is
that Villa is retiring continually
southward, trying to force recruits
into his ranks. His men are feeling
the pinch of hunger and are hoping
for an early summer to shield against
the cold of the mountains, where
they have retreated somewhere south
of Namiquipa.
Chief Question.
The question of overshadowing importance
now is: "Will Villa continue
to prepare for resistance?"
It is frankly hoped that he will,
for that is considered the best
chance, barring a lucky capture
through treachery of Villa's own
men, of bringing the American expedition
to an early successful conclusion.
If Villa refuses to make any
resistance, the men who have been
over the ground here believe, it may
require months to crush him.
An officer who has been through
many camps where Villa had passed
within a week found to all appearances
the bandit had failed to inflame
sentiment against the Americans.
"These rural people," said the officer,
"are in ignorance of any reliable
facts about the nature of the
American expedition. They have
been told that the Americans are an
invading: army, a dangerous enemy,
that they must fight for their lives.
But all those whom I' saw seemed
to be a very credulous people.
"They appeared to be waiting?
with some suspicion, it is true?but,
nevertheless, waiting before making
up their minds. This waiting I took
to be a hopeful sign. It was like going
into villages where the inhabitants
regard one with open suspicion,
but are ready to be friendly, provided
they think our mission is friendly.
That, I think, is the attitude of the
people toward us in many of the
places where Villa hoped for recruits."
For two weeks the reports along
Villa's trails show that he has seized
young men and boys of small towns
as forced recruits. His custom has
been for either himself or one of his
lieutenants -to line up most of the
male population for inspection. The
best physical specimens have been
pulled out of line and.told roughly
that they were honored above the
others because they become "Villa's
men."
In the Casas Grandes region, at
Galeana and El Valle, Villa secured
fully half a hundred men by this
method.
Working in Good Faith.
The disappearance of the Carranza
garrison at Namiquipa and reports
that these men had joined Villa was
not taken at American headquarters
as indicating serious trouble. Personal
investigation indicated to the
American officers, they said, that the
Constitutionalist army were cooperating
with good will.
Occasional defections of Mexican
troops have been expected, but there
has been no sign of a break reported
here on the part of any of the Constitutionalist
army officers with whom
the American forces have been in actual
cooperation. All of them appear
to be following orders from Gen.
Guiterrez, military governor of Chihuahua,
to close in on Villa from all
sides.

faced any strong Constitutionalist
forces. His strategy has been to select
points in the Constitutionalist
line where only a small force was
available. In such fights, according
to reliable reports reaching here, it
has been a case of "Villa coming m
on one side of the town while the
garrison went out on the other."

people but the annual birth rate is

pleted yesterday by the bureau of vital
statistics. The death rates, based
on returns for 1915, are: For
whites, 12.6; for negroes, 17.4. The
birth rates are: For whites, 29.1;
for negroes, 26.7. One hundred and
thirty-nine homicides were recorded.
Of the 24,501 deaths occurring
last year in South Carolina, making
an annual death rate per 1,000 population
of 15.2, 9,141 were white people,
15,350 were negroes and 10
were Indians. There were 44,950
births, distributed as follows: White
males, 11,015; white females, 10,127;
negro males, 12,110; negro fe- .
males, 11,512. The annual birth Ji
rate for the State is 28.
One section of the report is given
over to a consideration of pellagra,
from which there were 1,469 deaths
in South Carolina in 1915. This disease
ranks fourth in its toll, the three
leading ones being: Diseases of the
circulation, 2,539; pulmonary tuberculosis,
1,991; diseases of the kidney,
1,646. These four causes of death
are responsible for approximately
one-third of the deaths.
Both the number and the percentafrfl
nF rlpaths frnm nellae'ra arranfir
ed by counties, are given, showing
the following results in part:
Charleston with a death rate of 208
per 100,000; Sumter, 159.2; Greenwood,
152.6; Chester, 147.3; Greenville,
131.2; Richland, 131.2; Anderson
121; Georgetown, 114.4; York,
100.4; Florence, 98.8. The remainder
of the counties range lower thanthese,
the lowest being Clarendon
with a rate of 32.1.
Other causes of death, with their
toll, are: Intestinal diseases, 1,306; '/ba
pneumonia, 1,235; typhoid fever,
553; cancer, 513; dysentery, 502;
malaria, 465; bronchial pneumonia,
320; whooping cough, 207; diphtheria,
110; general accidents, 557; suicide,
53; railroad accidents, 53.
Infant Mortality High.

Approximately 32 per cent, of the
total number of deaths in 1915 were
of children under five years of age.
The total arranged bj* races are:
Whites, 2,834; negroes, 4,983; Indians,
5. In each instance the number
of deaths of the males exceeded
that of the corresponding females.
Not considering this one period the
largest number of deaths occurring
in the several succeeding decades fol
lows,: White men, from 60 to 70;
white women, from 30 to 40; negro
men and negro women, from 20
The largest death rate in South
Carolina is in Richland county, with
a rate of 29.3, which is followed
closely by Charleston county with
28. These excessive rates are due <
largely to the deaths in hospitals and
to the deaths not accounted for in
State institutions. Other counties
with high death rates are: George*

when he reappears he will kill or torture
Mexicans friendly to the Americans.

surprisingly little time for rest because
of the rapid,southward advance
