Pikesville Postoffice Robbed
Ami Rogers Station Entered.
Early Tuesday morning of this week
the postcffice at Pikesville, Md., was en
tered, the safe blown and $l5O in money
and S9O worth of stamps secured.
Entrance was gained through a win
dow in the rear of the building in which
the office was located and in which post
master Henry A. Davis and his family
lived. Mrs. Davis heard a noise before
the safe was blown, but it was attribut
ed to the wind. The thieves had made
fast all door® lead to the office, and they
made their escape without being molested.
Some time after the above occurred
two detectives who had been ordered to
watch at Roger’s station on the Green
Spring Valley railroad, saw two men
coming toward the depot. These men
picked the lock and entered the waiting
room and were about to go to work on
the money drawer when they discovered
the detectives.
A pistol fight at once opened up, one
of the detectives, M. S. Scott, of Balti
more, being shot four times hy James
Hardy, yeggman, of Pittsburgh, but not
seriously hurt. From Scott’s gun Hardy
received what proved to he fatal shots.
The rther detective, Ira W. Truitt, also
of Baltimore, and yeggman Edward Car
ney, of Pittsburg, engaged in a hand to
hand fight and both were badly hurt.
The body of Hardy was found in a
swamp near the station, a large roll of
money and postage stamps being in his
clothing. Carney was four din a hay loft
some hours later and confessed that he
and Hardy blew the safe at Pikesville.
Seven bullet wounds were found in
Hardy’s body, burglar tools and a half
pint of nitro-glycerine in his pockets.
It may be possible that these two men
are the ones who blew the safes in the
Thurmont office several weeks ago.

BRITISH MUSEUM GETS GEMS
Sir Arthur Herbert Church Bequeathed
Rare and Valuable Collection to
Famous Institution.
For many years the late Sir Arthur
Herbert Church devoted himself to
collecting precious stones, with the re
sult that when he died he had one of
the finest collections in Great Britain.
Whatever speculation may have arisen
as to what would become of the col
lection has been finally laid to rest by
the announcement that it has Just been
given to the British museum. Sir Ar
thur was long the president of the
Mlneralcgical society and in his ex
ploration work discovered several new
minerals. The collection consists of
more than 200 stones, mostly mounted
in rings, and every specimen unique.
Sir Arthur devoted his attention par
ticularly to the products of Ceylon and
for many years was able to secure the
pick of the rarer species of gems that
came to light there. To the mineralo
gist the pride of the collection is a
magnificent aurora-red specimen of
spessartite, a variety of garnet that
seldom provides stones large and clear
enough for Jewelry purposes. Weigh
ing over six karats and beautifully cut
in the modern fashion, the stone stands
practically alone in the literature of
gems. In addition the collection In
cludes the most varied series of zir
cons in existence, and there are also
excellent assortments of tourmalines,
topazes, emeralds, opals and spinels.
The opals include two fine stones of
Jet black color.
LAKE TAHOE ONCE HIGHER
Some Ancient Volcano Became Active
and Great Rocky Block Sank and
Formed Pool Bed.
The statement sometimes made that
“Tahoe is an old volcanic crater” is
not true, according to report of the
government geological survey. The
region about the lake shows evidences
of volcanic activity of various kinds,
and the lake waters themselves have
probably been dammed at times by
outpourings of lava. A lava flow ap
pears to have temporarily filled the
outlet channel below Taboo City. The
lake, however, lies In a structural de
pression—a dropped block of the
earth’s crust. During the Neocene
epoch and the earlier part of the
Pleistocene epoch the waters of Lake
Tahoe stood much higher than now,
probably on account of lava dams
which have since been cut through.
Distinct beaches that mark former
higher levels are found up to about
one hundred feet above the present
lake, but it is believed that the waters
formerly rose to still greater heights.
At Tahoe City the most distinct of
these old beaches is a terrace thirty
five to forty feet above the level of
the lake, and it is this terrace that
makes the level ground on which Ta
hoe tavern is builL

BIT OF REAL POLAND
VILLAGE IN ASIA MINOR HAS AN
INTERESTING HISTORY.
Peopled Many Years Ago by Vet
erans of the Crimean War, the
Community Has Maintained Its
Purity and Independence,
Hundreds of miles from Poland, in
Turkish territory, not far from tho
Black sea and tho Bosporus, there is
a Polish village. It has been there
for GO years. But the news of its ex
istence will come as a surprise both
to the world at largo and to the Polish
Poles of Poland.
The village was “discovered” re
cently by a German Journalist, the
correspondent of a Berlin newspaper,
who was watching tho fighting at the
Dardanelles. He sandwiched in be
tween bis dispatches describing deatli
and destruction on the Gallipoli penin
sula an interesting description of this
peaceful and forgotten bit of old Po
land under the title of “A Polish Is
land."
The village was founded back in the
jlfties of tho last century during the
Crimean war. Among the Russian sol
diers fighting in the Crimea against
tho British and French and Turks
were some from Russian Poland. Of
these a number were captured by tho
Turks and taken to Scutari, opposite
Constantinople, in Asia Minor. There
some Polish noblemen, bitter enemies
of Russia, found these men, and hit
upon the idea of emancipating this
handful of their fellow-countrymen
from the control of Russia. Foremost
among these noblemen was Prince
Adam Czartorisky, a very wealthy
man, who, from his own pocket and
cut of funds collected by him from
other Poles who hated Russia, pur
chased lands in Asia Minor from
Turkish owners and there established
the Polish prisoners in a village of
their own.
On that spot tho prisoners and
their descendants have continued to
live to this day. ’When the German
Journalist visited tho village he found
a few of the original colonists still liv
ing. The villagers, ho writes, are
genuine Poles, still speaking their
tive tongue. Tho noblemen who
founded the village fetched the wives
of many of the prisoners from Poland
