Dr. Weese and P.

Speakers.
Th Ontario-Teacher Association
held a vorjr enthusiastic and Instruc
tive meeting In th auditorium of the
high school building last Friday ev
ening. The room wa wall filled with par
ent, both men and women, who are
t.klng a keen Intereet In the re
sult accomplished thus far by the -aoclatlon.
The evening's program wa started
off by the boy' glee club of the Hull
achool. Their effort were o well
appreciated by the audlenre that they
were called back for a second num
ber. Thl win followed by Dr. W. J.
Weeae In a forty minute lecture on
Heredity and Rugenlr which wa
both Instructive and highly enler
talnlng What I hare to nay I not based on
any fine-spun theories dealing with
hypothetical problems, but on the
other hand, all Is based on actual
fact that have been gathered from
family record, report from public
Institutions, alma houaea, statistics
gathered far government use at
Washington l C, and from history.
Kugenlca la the science of the Im
provement of the human race by bet
ter breeding. Kugenlca ha to do with
the trait that ar In the blood. The
eugenic standpoint I that of the ag
riculturist who while recognising the
value of culture believe that perma
nent advancement Is to be made only
by securing the best blood so he ae
lects the beat ear of eorn, the
smoothest ami beat abaped potato.
The stockman not only selects the
beat blood In annual but of these he
agaiu re-eelecta the choicest and
weeds out the least "TTWW!lTiT7'TrflgTT
among the herds and improves hi
rata of horses, cattle or hog.
Can the human race be so Improv
ed? Yea It can, but will It ever te
ao? It I hard to tell. Hut Hie pur-
pone of the eugenic movement is not
only to make better matches among
aane and healthy people, but to pre
vent the marrying of Individuals who
are by their physical, mental or moral
make up entirely unfit to marry. Hut
some would aay It would he a peculiar
world that would not let a man or wo
man marry whomsoever they pleaae.
Hut mother would you want your
daughter to marry a man who la
criminal, or a man who haa mental
derangement, or a man who Is foul
with disease? To prevent tbla la
what the eugenlat hopes to accom
plish, for all of theae traits In man or
woman are Inheritable and go to
make a race weak mentally, morally
end physically, and fill our state pen
itentiaries and reform schools, alms
houaea, Insane asylums, schools of
deaf dumb and blind. Who keepa
theae Institutions going wheu It comes
to upkeep and support? You do. This
is not all, there are thousands and
thousands of epileptics, Imbeclls, cre
tins, and persons afflicted with dts
eeaea that should be aeggregated
from the rest of society but who are
cared for at home thrusting untold
care on those around them, and who
never reach our public Institution.
Going on with the need of eugen
ics. Nearly 2 million of children

erage 227 Pound-, Koch
That It pays to raise pure bred
hoga (or any other animal, for that
matter,) was emphatically demon
strated Saturday, when J W Tyler
sold to Henry Goul 18 head of pedi
greed Poland Chlnaa, 7 mouths old,
that averaged 8X7 V4 pounds each.
They brought the top price, 8 cents
a pound, and totaled $328 for the
bunch. They were shipped to the
Portland market and were the finest
lot of hogs ever received here.
The hogs were raised by Mr. Tyler
himself and were aristocrats Their
parents are of royal lineage, and the
offspring sold were perfect specimens
of the Poland China type. No special
care or feed was given the porkers
They netted Mr. Tyler 125 a mouth
since they were born.
Mr. Tyler has ono of the beat herds
of Poland Chlnaa in the state. He
has recently added a boar and a sow
pig, each of which cost him $150.

THE TELEGRAPHERS
MEET IN BOISE
The Western I'nlon Telegraph Co
held a meeting of the managers of the
different stations of Payette, Weiapr,
Caldwell, Nampa and Outario at Hoi
se last Sunday, and discussed the
various phases of the Telegraphers
trade. The meetlug was purely au
educational affair and Mr. Treusdale,
the local representative reports that
many things were learned by the op
orators present to increase their effi
ciency in the work.
Increased Interest
Shown in Dairy
Business.
The testing assoclstlon ha not se
cured a man to look after the testing
of the cow for them, but expect to
hear from one in a few daya.
There Is an Increased Interest In
Dairying In this section. The Nysaa
cheese factory Is making good money
for th" men who are sending milk to
It and the same I the condition at
tending the Payette butter plant
Farmer who have always opposed
the keeping of cows are beginning to
realise Hint a Utile cash coming In
every month I a very good thing. Al
so that It Is quite a convenience to
l.ave a market where all the milk can
be marketed every day for cash. 8ev
eanl newcomers are cow men and
their Influence will he felt by the old
timers.
Mr. Howard Is devoting his stttn-
tlon these day to the Malheur drain
age district, getting the owner of
lands under the dltchea to sign up
their lands. Ho Amis it requires a
lot of time and talk to get some of
the owners to see the advantage of
having the surplus waters taken care
of. The estimate of the cost Is from
$12 gwn, according to the benefit
derived. Mr Howard aays It will he
possible, wheu the system Is installed
to reclaim even the worst alkalled
lands in the district, because there Is
ample fall to run off the excess wat
er. Many of the farmers who own
lands that are still able to handle all
the water do not realise that It Is
simply a question of time when their
lsnds will bo wster logged, If drain
age la not provided. The water lev
el Is gradually rising and will even
tually reach over the danger line. It
Is a whole lot better to provide the
drainage in time to save the land,
rather than wait and lose the use of
the lands for a time, until they are
reclaimed. To one who haa seen the
water level gradually come up, It
seems strsnge thst any owner of
lands under a ditch will hesitate to
provide drainage, now that an oppor
tunity is afforded.
WILLARD RETAINS
THE PREMIERSHIP
New York. jess Wllleru, ztrrrr

outpointed Prank Moran lu a In round
bout here. Willard had the better of
points lu ever) round except the third,
which went to Moran by a narrow
margin, and the elthth and ninth,
whlcb were even.
The conqueror of Jack Johnson de
clared he had broken all the bones In
the back of his right haud during a
smashing rally in the third round, and
It waa noticeable that he did not use
hla right to auy exten in the later
rounds. Occasionally be uppercultcit

but It lacked the punishing power
shown In his trsining work.

make no Impression ou Willard with
his hsrdesl swings, he fought steadily
and courageously under a hall of left ,
Jaba and hooks which battered his face
aud almost closed his left eye toward
the end of the bout.
