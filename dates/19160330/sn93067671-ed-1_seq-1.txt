I There is a decided ten
- dency this season toward
the better grades and high
er class in' Hats and other
- Millinery Goods. We have
them, 'but as usual our
prices are wonderful both
- In the intrinsic values and
the "Style" values.
Also Hats are betterlook
inig than forseveralseas6ors i
past. The styles are be
coming and the fact that
- considerable more materi
als are used in trimming
them makes it look like an
old-time season of "Hats :
-Beautiful."

BQNIFAY,
J. P. Carey, Jr., member of the house
of representatives from Fickens, coun
ty, announces that he will not offer for
re-election this year and that he is thru
with politics for the present. Mr. Ca
rey.ha&snauy- friends in'the countywho
will regret his decision, but who realize
that they cannot urge him to give his
time to the public and neglect his pri
vate business. It might be mentioned
here that the new land registration law
which was passed by the last legisla
ture was introduced by Mr. Carey and
was one of the best, if not the best,
pieces of legislation enacted by that
body. This law will prove its worth if
the people will take advantage of it.

About the best thing and also the most
enjoyable that has occurred here re
cently was the oratorical contest held
on the night of March 24. There are
two gold medals given here from year i
to year, so it makes an interesting and
lively contest among our pupils, and
this one proved an exception to the rule
in that it was thq very best contest ever
held in our auditorium. Joe Hunt won
first place in the boys' contest and Miss
Minnie Lou Coleman won first place in
the girls' contest. These two young
people will represent us in the county
contests and we expect them todo credit
to both themselves and the school. Mr.
Welcher in a short but interesting ad
dress delivered the Ponder medal to
Miss Coleman, while Mr. DuBose in, a
splendid way made the boys a talk and
delivered the Morgan medal to Joe
Hunt. 'In the boys' contest Furman
Dacus and Bates Aiken won second and
third places respectively, and in the
girls' contest Miss Mattie Hooker won
second place and Miss Ruby Looper
third.
We regret to state that Mr. Hal
Hiott, principal of the Mt. Carrnel,
school, is ill with grip, being confined
to his room at present.
Mr. ~Rowland Chastain died at' his
home near Pickens last Saturday after

many relatives and friends to mourn
his death. Mr. Chaitain moved from
