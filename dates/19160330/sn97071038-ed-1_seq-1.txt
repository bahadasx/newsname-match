Secretary Smead Writes of Proposed
Improvement in County Fair and
Discusses Equitable Method For
Raising Finances.
Heppner, Oregon, March 29, 1916.
The Fair Board announced some
time ago that they expected to ask
for a special tax measure to be voted
on at the Primary election in May,
asking tor a tax of -mlll for fair
purposes, the money to be used for
paying off the outstanding indebted
ness and to finance the 1916 fair,
making this fair free to all. After
going Into this more thoroughly the
Board has concluded that owing to
the fact that this money, if the meas
ure carried, would not be available
until 1917 and in order to make the
fair free this season they would have
to borrow the amount and pay inter
est on the same, that it will be bet
ter to hold the fair this year in the
usual manner, and put the matter up
to the voters at the November elec
tion. Then if the measure carried the
Board would be in a better position
for carrying out the plans they have
in view. , r
If a county fair is a good thing for
the people of the county, then it
should be financed by the people and
the fair board should not be placed
" In a position where they are so ham
pered that they are afraid to do what
. they know ought to be done, in order
that the best results may be obtained
for the people. , The fair should be
v free, and the people should make
this the one big gala time of the
year. The educational features
should be, and I think will be, made
. much better each year.. We have
been held back on account of not
having jtioney enough, from having
W.IMHlJiiUMMjW. ti vjv
very much better and more Interest
ing than what we did have. The
board realizes that the fair must be
made better each year and they ex
pect to make the 1916 fair better and
more interesting by having more ed
- ucational features, such as Judging
contests, a course of lectures on
Child Welfare, talks by experts on
Agriculture, Horticulture, Cattle,
Sheep and Hogs; In fact many new
features will be Introduced this year,
and many more would be Introduce!
if we had the money in sight to
guarantee the payment for same.

Secretary.

SUPREME LODGE WILL
An event of nation-wide Import
ance will take place in Portland next
August when the Supreme Lodge
Knights of Pythias assembles there.
This gathering will be of especial im
portance to members of the order re
siding this side of the Rockies, Inas
much as this is the first time in the
history of the order that the Supreme
Lodge has ventured out west. The
Knights out this way have it in mind
and are laying plans to entertain the
Eastern visitors in a manner most
properly portraying the spirit of the
West. Not only will every effort be
put forth to examplify the fraternal
spirit of the order, but nothing will
be left undone to advertise the north
west in the most efficient manner. To
this end all local lodges in the do
main of Oregon are preparing to take
part in the exercises In Portland with
floats and other practical schemes to
fihow our Eastern brothers that this
is the greatest spot on earth to live In
from every standpoint of living. Mor
row and Gilliam counties will likely
unite in advertising the two counties
at the convention. The resources be
ing almost identical It will be a mat
ter of saving to the lodges of the
district to go together in advertising
both counties. This plan is being
taken up by the Condon, Arlington
and Heppner lodges and a district
convention will probably be called at
one of these places in the near fu
ture to take definite jteps.

Pttdberg-Cason. r-r--i'
A very pretty wedding occurred at
the home of Mr. and Mrs. E. L. Pad
bors, of lone, Sunday, March 26th,
when their daughter Opal May was
married to Walter Guy Cason. At
2:30 o'clock the young people en
tered the room to the strains of the
wedding march rendered by Miss
Muriel Cason, where they were join
ed in the bonds of wedlock, E. Tem
ple Starkey, pastor of the Baptist
church, officiating.
The bride is one of the popular
young ladies jt,4ha vicinity, and la
loved and admired by all who know
her. The groom Is a young man of
high ideals and sterling worth. In
view of their nobility of character
and loyalty to each other we predict
for them a bright and happy future.
Their many friends join in heartiest
congratulations and best wishes.
They will make their home In lone.
M. Hansen, of Spokane, is here
looking after his land Interests. He
Is the owner of a large tract of land
to the north of lone and is arranging
to transfer a portion of it to other
parties who contemplate opening up
a stock ranch. Mr. Hansen is a pion
eer farmer of the Palouse country,
settling there some 40 years ago, and
for many years had to undergo great
hardship and would have been glad
to give away his land to anyone that
would take it. This was before the
railroad reached Whitman county
and there was no market for any
thing the people there could raise.
After that event the advancement of
that famous section was very rapid,
and Mr. Hansen says that much of
the farm land there could not be had
now for less than $160 per acre. It
is his opinion that Morrqw county
will soon come to the front and he
freely expresses the opinion that all
people who are holding lands here
simply for speculative purposes, just
as he has been doing for a number
of years, should place their holdings
on the market and encourage actual
home builders to locate here and de
velop the farms. It is his Intention
to do this, and he is well satisfied
that if the lands here are properly
handled, profitable results will fol
low. He points to his neighbor, Mr.
H. Stender, as being one who has
amply proved this theory, and what
he has done others can do in the
same section of country. Mr. Han
sen is right.
Walter Cochran was down from
Heppner over Sunday. He has pur
chased the plant used In publishing
the lone Journal, and will make
some necessary additions thereto pre

and a young man of splendid quali
fications that have been developed
somewhat along the line of country
newspaper work, and his numerous
friends here will be pleased to en
courage him in the new venture.
A pleasant surprise was in store
for the large audience that gathered
at the Congregational church on
Tuesday evening to listen to a recital
given by the music pupils of Miss
Margaret Jones. Miss Jones has a
class of a dozen pupils on piano, and
they each one had a part in the pro
gram, the rendition of their pieces
proving that they are making rapid
advancement. The church was filled
by parents and friends of the per
formers and the program was greatly
enjoyed.

CLUB
OPPOSES
STATE TEXT 60015
R. J. Carsner of Spray Wou'd Con
nect Heppner Up With New Mail
Route to Monument By Way
of Sprays Meeting Dates
Changed.
At their regular meeting In the
Council chambers last Friday eve
ning, the Heppner Commercial Club
went on record as being opposed to
tne siate printing of school text
books. This action was taken after
a letter from the Salem Commercial
Club had been read asking the local
organization to endorse such a move
ment. It was the unanimous opin
ion of club members that such a plan
would not prove satisfactory.
Secretary Smead read a communi
cation from C. C. Chapman of Port
land dealing with the Stevens bill, a
bill which is now being considered in
Congress. The local club endorsed
the bill by passing a set of resolu
tions which are as follows:
WHEREAS Congressman Dan V.
Stephens of Nebraska has Introduced
in the House of Representatives a bill
entitled a Bill "To protect the public
against dishonest advertising and
false pretenses in Merchandising"
and being known as H, B. 9671, and
which measure has been introduced
In the U. S. Senate, and
WHEREAS the passage of said biU
is of vital Import to the retail deal
er and forbids discrimination by way
of discounts, rebates, monopoly or at
tempt to control the markets through
combinations, price agreements and
similar practices with other dealers
or manufacturers . of articles in the
same class, thus being a measure
aimed at the protection of the con
sumers as well.
Now, therefore, be it resolved, that
the Heppner Commercial Club does
hereby endorse said bill and urgently
requests our Senators and Represen
tatives in Congress to give the same
their united support and be it further
Resolved, that the Secretary be in
structed to mail to each of said Sena
tors and Congressmen, a copy of
these resolutions.
R. J. Carsner, prominent Wheeler
county stockman, introduced once
more the mail situation and placed
before the club the plan which he
and other Interested parties are now
working on to get the route between
Heppner and Monument re-established.
Petitions for this route, which
would include Spray, are being cir
culated for the establishment of a
Star route between Spray and Mon
ument. In his opinion, Heppner
should work to get the route from
Hardman to Spray re-established.
This would give Heppner a direct
communication with Monument. The
distance between Spray and Hard
man is 32 miles. Mr. Carsner ex
pressed his willingness to meet with
a committee from the Club at any
time and view out a new road which
would eliminate the road now going
over Deadman's hill. The entire mat
ter was referred to the mail route
committe which consists of A. M.
Phlps, J. J. Nys, and J. Lj Wilkins.
The meeting nights for the club
were changed from the second and
fourth Friday of each month to the
second and fourth Monday of each
month.
The feature of the next meeting on
the evening of April 10 will be the
discussion of city taxation for coun
ty road funds. At the present time
the taxpayers of Heppner pay noth
ing into the general road fund. The
plan is a proposed tax levy of two
mills.
ELKS' All PARTY
1ST
I
An energetic committee of Elks
has been busy the past several weeks
working up an entertainment which
will be pulled off at the lodge hall
tomorrow evening. This entertain
ment Is rather In the form of a big
party and has come to be an annual
event with the Elks. There are many
brothers who do not attend the an
nual ball and for the benefit of these
and others the lodge arranges some
thing to which all feel at home. Just
what the committee has up its sleeves
at this time we are not sufficiently in
formed to tell, but we surmise that
there will be a hot time for some of
the brothers, at least, and a Jolly
good time for all. Each Elk Is en
titled to invite one gentleman who In
turn may invite a lady. On account
of many brothers and possible Invit
ed guests being employed at a late
hour on Saturday evening the com
mittee thought it best to change the
date to Friday. The program starts
at 8:00 p. m.
