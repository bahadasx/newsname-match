A prominent farm paper pub
lished in Chicago has called the
attention of the public to what it
calls "The most critical time in
the history of that distinctive
crop-Corn."
Last year was a cold wet season
and corn failed to mature as it
should. In consequence the seed
for this year's crop is poor. Germ
ination tests made over a greater
part of the corn b.elt show an un
usually poor seed condition.
Seed corn should not be ob
tained from a distance, as it is
very susceptible to changes and
should be thoroughly acclimated.
To obtain good seed corn it will
be necessary to test every ear be
fore planting any of it.
This refers just as much to the
1914 crop as it does to the 1915
one.
In northwestern Ohio the To
ledo Commerce Club in co-operation
with the bankers and eleva
tors are doing what they can to
arouse the people's attention to
the importance of thoroughly test
ing their seed.
Test don't guess.
State Fish .Commission Makes' Dras
tic Ruling.
Indirectly, wholesale fish
houses, as well as fishennen
here, are affected by the new
ruling of the state fish and
game commission.
The commission ruled Satur
day that here could be no seine
fishing in any of the rivers of
the state. The commission met
in Toledo with several fishermen
Saturday and went over the sit
uation. Not eyen carp may be taken
from the rivers with "seines this
season. Seine fishing in the
lakes is not hindered by the
ruling. The mouth of the Mau
mee was fixed on a line with
Presque Isle and Bay View Park
and Ottawa river on a line with
the bay shore.
