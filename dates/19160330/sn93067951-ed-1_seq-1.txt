opposing the proposition. Th
opposition argued the objectioi
of paternalism and all that; bu
it was charly shown that th
armor plate trust which ha
been making the United State
government pay $010 a ton fo
its wares has been selling to th
Russian government at $240
ton It was also shown that nav
al officers who direct the pur
chase of armor plate have stoc
in the companies that make an
sell armor plate. Under cond1
lions like this it seems to us tha
the government should not onl
be in a position to protect itse]
from such extortion, but i
ought to administer a paterni

officers who are robbing it.Yorkville

Automobile Runs
Over Aged Pedestrian
Last Saturday afternoon, while
standing in Main St., Mr. J. W.
Jordan wa? knocked down and
run over by an automoble driven
by Miss Nell Meiton, the 13year-old
daughter of Mr. Ervin
Melton.
The street was fairly filled
with vehicles and Miss Melton
was carefully threading her way
through these at a reasonable
speed, sounding the horn at intervals,
when Mr. Jordun, who
is approximately (55 years of age
and hears with difliculty, stepped
immediately into the path
? of the on-coming machine. The
car passed over his body, seriously
bruising him, but at last
report he was recoving rapidly.
Eye witnesses seem agreed
that the accident was unavoidable
and that the youug lady
managed the machine very
skilfully.

Negro Runs Away
With Handcuffs
After some clever detective
work and the use of a successful
ruse Mr. C. L. Melton, rural policemau
at Pageland, captured a
fugitive badly wanted in Lancaster,
only to allow him to escapo
a little latter.
On November Oth, Ernest M.
Watkins superintendent of tho
Lancaster Oil Mill was shot and
killed. John Mcllwain. a negro,
was wanted for this crime and a
reward of $200 was offered for
his arrest.
Last Thursday he was located
by Mr. Melton about six miles
from Pageland. Mr. Melton organized
a small posse, who, under
the guise of bird hunting,
succeeded in approaching the
negro without suspicion.
The man was captured, handcuffed
and the trip to Lancaster
begun.
About dark, it is said that tho
negro complained of thirst and
the party alighted to get water
at the well of Mr. J. A. Arant.
On passing through a gate
back to the car, the negro bolted,
handcuffs and all. He probably
was going some from the
start as it is said that the shots
from Mr. Melton's revolver could
not overtake him.
Bloodhounds were at once g itten
from the penitentiary at Columbia
and put on the negro's
trail, which they followed for
some distance, but, loosing it,
they were unable to take it up
again and were sent back to the
penitentiary. Sheriff John P.
Hunter, of Lancaster, hearing of
the escape of the negro, left
there by automobile at 3 o'clock
the next morning for Chesterfield
county to assist in the apnroliancion
