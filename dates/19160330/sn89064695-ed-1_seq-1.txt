Selfish Motives.
de- In-
The former members of the
funct White Earth board of
dian education which was created
by the local council of this respr
vation, but which ceased to exist
when the General Council of the
Minnesota Chippewas created a
board, recently sent a pro
test to Congressman Ellsworth
against the appropriation of $4,750
for the expenses of the tuition,
board, books, travelling and other
expenses of five Chippewa boys
who are attending Keewatin Aca
demy ot Wisconsin, and ask that
the appropriation be placed under
the jurisdiction of the defunct
board.
As a justification for their re
quest the members of the board
charge that Keewatin Academy
devotes more attention to athletics
than to the education of boys.
The board was abolished by the
council because its members did
not show that spirit of fairne89
which the council desired by dis
tributing scholarships to boys ac
cording to their merits, but its
members confined themselves to
giving these scholarships to mem
bers of their own families, and the
absurdity of their charges against
a school, regarding which they
know absolutely nothing about, is
apparent to those who know about
the controversy between the mem
bers of the defunct board and the
local council in 1913.
Peter Jourdan personally went
to Washington on his own behalf
and on behalf of the other Chippe
wa boys at Keewatin Academy,
and, through the president of the
Chippewa General Council, John
G. Morrison, asked for assistance
from the Senate Indian Committee,
and this resulted in the appropria
tion being made.
It probably does not occur to
one or two members of the board
that the members of this and other
Chippewa reservations may have
properly construed the motives of
the former in making the protest.
They should have borne in mind
that tribal educational funds should
be distributed equally and not be
confined to the members of one or
two families.
All the Chippewa boys who are
attending academies and colleges
should receive assistance from the
educational funds of the Chippe
was of Minnesota, and no member
of the Minnesota Chippewa bands
should raise any objections to this,
but it is decidedly selfish to try
and have an appropriation set aside
and take it from some Chippewa
boys to give it to others who have
already received assistance for at
least two years from the tribal
funds to pay for their higher edu
cations.

Gregory.
Mr. Daniels, the attorney in
question, yelled to the public from
the pain of his humiliation and the
Cambridge North Star used the
complaint of the kicked out attor
ney simply for political effect.

Red Lake Indians May
Be Taken Care Of.
Last Thursday a bill was intro
duced in Congress by Representa
tive Lindberg which provides that
the lands upon the diminished Red
Like reservation shall be drained,
so that a large portion of the res
ervation in the vicinity of Red
Lake River may be placed in a
condition for cultivation which is
now too swampy to do.
The bill provides for the appro
priation of $100,000 of the tribal
funds of the Chippewas to be re
imbursed when the pine timber of
the Red Lake reservation has been
sold. It also provides that only
Indian labor will be used in dig
ging the ditches, although mechan
ics other than Indians may be em
ployed to operate ditching ma
chines.
A full text of the bill will be
published when received, so that
the Chippewas in general may
"know What the bill provides."

Favor Right Of Nomin

Notwithstanding that twenty
four Indian delegations from
throughout the country, that were
at Washington during the past
winter, expressed themselves very
strongly, at their meetings at the
National Hotel in that city, in fav
or of the Right of Nomination Bill
introduced in Congress by Senator
.Johnson of South Dakota, Rev.
Sherman Coolidge, president of
the Society of American Indians,
sent the following telegram to
Senator Ashurst, chairman of the
Senate Indian Committee:
Faribault, Minn.

Senate bill 3904, introduced
by Senator Johnson of South Da

such law the very worst elements
will seek to control Indian tribes.
We ask your aid against the meas

not take issue with him regarding
what could only be hi.s personal
view** regarding the Right of Nom
ination Bill.
By asking Senator Ashursfs aid
against the Right of Nomination
Bill, the plural number and
signing thib request as the presi
dent of the Society of American
Indians, Mr. Coolidge overstepped
the authority which the society
has vested in him, and likewise
justice and wnat is right and true.
We have yet to hear among the
Indians of this country who are
not in the employ of the .govern
ment, a dissenting voice against
giving Indians the legal right to
vote f'r or airiinst the retention
of their superintendents.
It quite probable that some
Indian*, who are in the employ of
the Indian office intent, be induced
by the, powers that be to mak ex
pressions unfavorable to the John
son bill, or its substitute, but not
all of them, but these expressions
would be of such a sellls.li charac
ter that it is not believed Con
gress would give much weight to
them.
Who compose the very worst
elements" to which Mr. Coolidge
refers? Are the delegates that
were in Washington and urged the
bill and in whom their respective
tribes had sufficient confi^nce to
.send there, the elements he refers
to? No other conclusion can ho
reached since they urged the adop
tion of the bill. I
Indian traitors to Indian intei
ests may cause the weights of jus-
ice to be outbalar.ced for the time
being, but in the end anything
that is right will win, and if the
American Indians stand unitedly
together for the propositions con
tained in the Johnson bill, yr its
substitute, they will surely "'in
before many congresses have
passed.
