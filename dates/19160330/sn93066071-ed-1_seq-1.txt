It was without doubt one of the best
attended and most actlvo conventions
ever held in the state, A hard fight
by each of the contending factions and
their friends, was made, to seo who
would be tho national leaner in the
state, and when Mr. Harrjs and his
ardent supporters learned, after tak
ing several test votes, that the McUraw
fellows had woo, they peacefully and
honorably submitted to defeat, pro
claiming aloud that they were still
Republicans and in the fight against
the common enemy, whom they not
nily hoped defeat nationally, but
in the state of Oklahoma ub well..
While the .light wns bitter through
out tho convention, yet harmony Jpre
vniled and all was well when the con
vention adjourned,

PRETTY CLOSE CALL.
Ohas. Hlnkle had a pretty close call
to being dragged to death Sunday
evening. As it was he was severely
bruised and lacerated about the face
and head. He was riding horseback
when one of the bridle reins broke and
he was unable to aontrol his horse. It
ran away with him, throwing him off
and when he fell his foot hung in the
(Stirrup. He was dragged for some
distance behind the running, kicking
horse and was struck once in the face.
The impact from the blow seemed to
release his foot from the stirrup, at
any rate when ho was struck In tho
face his foot was freed, which is proba
bly all that saved his life Charlie
was in town Wednesday looking much
the worse from his painful experience
bat feeling mighty lucky that he
escaped as well as he did It certainly
was a close call and his friends are
rejoicing that he escaped so luckily,

W.B.STRANATHANDEAD.
After many months ot suffering the
earthly career of Wm. B. Stranathan
came to a peaceful close on Wednes
day, March 8, 1910,.at the family homo
In Harlan township. He had been a
sufferer from paralysis for more than
a year, much ot that time being1
almost helpless, but. patient and cheer
ful even unto the last days.
William B. Stranathan was born in
MeLain county, Illinois, April 10, 1810,
making him at tho time of his demise
a trifle less than 70 years of age.
When a voting man of 'M he removed
to Iowa, wheie on the 7th ot March,
1K00. ha was united In marriasoMo.
Lucy A. Meadows, tho wife who sur
vives him, and for fifty years they
traveled life's path together celebrat
ing their golden wedding anniversary
only the day before his death. To
their union seven children were born,
one dying in infancy The others are
Mrs Esther llcrrington of Wichita,
Samuel P. Stranathan of Glenwood,
Iowa; William G. Stranathan of Bea
ver City. Oklahoma; Edward L. Stran
athan, Mrs, Nellie Gibson and Blaine
0. Stranathan of Gaylord One sister
nlso survives, Mrs. Julln Warren ot
Glenwood, lows. Besides these are
llftcen grandchildren.
At the first call for volunteors in the
Civil war, Mr. Stranathan enlisted in
tho 39th Iowa Infantry, serving his
country faithfully for more than threw
years four brothers marching away
together for service under southern
skies. It can be Bald here now In per
fect truth that he was a good soldier
for his country, both in war and In
peace.
It was as early as January, 1870,
that he left his Iowa home with a par
ty nt buffalo hunters for Western Kan
sas. During that month he camped in
Smith county, and being so pleased
with the country, humesteaded the
farm on which he lived at the time of
his death. In October, 1871. he brought
his family from Iowa to permanently
establish the new home. He was one
ot, the first, if not tho very first to file
on a claim in the southern part of the
county. During all of the succeeding
years lie has lived and labored on the
land he chose in the days of his youth
when almost any place between 'the
horizons could have been his for the
asking. With persistent care he tilled
the sol), meeting patiently and event
ually subduing the privations and vex
ations that beset the pioneer. He
builded a home on the prairie. With
his own hands he planted trees on the
shadowless plains and tended them
with care. .Today stately elms make
a magnificent colonnade about the
home he loved. Under their shadow
the happy voices of children mingled
with the restless zephyrs voices of
children long since scattered In the
turmoil ot the world's relentless wage.
Over their shimmering leaves the
showers of forty summers hnve spread
beauty in the Bunlight. Nestling there
Is the peaceful home around which is
entwined the memories ot the ideal
life. It was especially appropriate
that the final summons should find
him still on th spot that drew his fan
cy in vigorous youth and held him In
enfeebled age.
Mr. Stranathan was n charter mem
ber ot the Methodist Episcopal church
of Gaylord, being intensely interested
and active in the organization antl in
the prosecution ot its ideals. He was
a fine christian gentleman, teaching
by precept and example the highest
and noblest lessons of life Few men
have lived to enjoy in a greater degree
the respect and e'teem ot a communi
ty. He waB a good husband, a good
father and a good neighbor. He aided
in the mighty work of building an
empire, but more important still he at
the same time builded friendships as
iRSting as time. He labored faithfully
and intelligently, and he has now
claimed the abundant reward of a
well-spent life. ' v
The funeral services wore bold at
the Methodist church .last Friday,
being conducted by the paitnr, Rev.
M, E.Smith, and the bodv was con
signed to its last resting place In the
Gaylord cemetery, Gaylord (Kansas)

A MARCH SNOWSTORM.
Thedeclded cliango to cooler weath.
er Saturday terminated in a snow
storm Saturday nighx which, for a
time, looked like it might develop into
a real blizzard, but the cold wave did
not prevail forlong and although con
siderable snow fell it soon melted-intn
the ground and the weather turned off
warm and pleasant. By noon Sunday
all the snow had disappeared and nne
would never have guesed, hod' they
nbt known, that only a few hours
before a real snow storm was upon us.
It clouded up during the night Wed
nesday night and rain and sleet fell for
a short time in small quantities, low
ering the temperature somewhat. At
the time of writing the weather seems
to be undecided as to the exact brand
to be dealt out within the next twenty
four hours
