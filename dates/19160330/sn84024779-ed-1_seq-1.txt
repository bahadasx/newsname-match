well advanced alng all lines.
There is a considerable amount
of available talent this year which
will guarantee plenty of fun and

In as much as the library has been
free to its patrons since June
first, there has been no revenue
coming in to improve and enlarge
it. Consequently there is a great
need for .new books particularly
children's books. During the
month of February there were
nine hundred patrons visiting the

ricultural lines. The subjects on
which he is to speak are of vital
interest to every one. Not only
the farmers, but those whose
homes are in towns with but
small garden plots, should at

for the entire community, and a
cordial invitation is extended to

B. B. DIRECTORS
MEET TODAY
Providing that All of Them Can
Get Together at the Same
Time
FANS GETTING VERY EAGER
And Have Their Ears Peeled For
Anything In the Way of
Anything New
In and around the cozy corners
all winter long- the war in Europe
and lately the chase of Villa the
Mexican bandit has been holding
the center of attention, even of
the base ball fans, but when the
fans began lo read about Arkan
sas Smith, who caught for the lo
cal ball team here last year, rip
ping things up, down in the Min
neapolis camp at Hickman, Ky.,
naturally the old "slide Kelly
slide" blood started on its spring
ward rush even before the ice had
gone out.
In talking the mailer over
ahout. the ball team for the com
ing year that is going to represent
the little twins, it is nearly the
same concensus of opinion every
where that the directors ought to
hire a manager and let the mana
ger have full control of the leant,
off and on the diamond.
Last, year the directors were
very much in evidence all the lima
and it kept the ball players on the
ragged edge, this one and that
one ordering things to lie done
while (he. manager had to grit his
teeth and bear it. Wow lets get out
of those kiddish ways and get
ight down to real business. Any
where ball is successful the man
ager deals with the players and
the directors, and if the directors
want anything done by the play
er or players they should go to
the manager and not to the ball
player. Now we are nol knocking
any of the directors of the base
ball club but are just trying to
show them where they hinder the
work of the hoys instead of help
ing- things, -although they gave
their best to the club and nobody
appreciated their liouesl ami hard
work anymore than the Times.
Just deal with the manager and
see that he hits the "ball".
The directors are planning oil
meeting today ami then calling
a meeting of the fans at. a later
date and as the lime is getting
late, things should be hurried up
a hit. Many other towns in this
neighborhood have their teams
already picked out, and we don't
want, to be left in the rear for a
moment.
We might offer a suggest ion or
two to the directors and fans in
the little twins that Coach Ward
at the Science
School
might, be
secured lo handle the l.cani all the
way lliroiiuh the season or E. C.
Whiting who is now permanently
located jn this city. We think that
to secure either otie or the other
would he the best tiling that could
lie done and of course we are only
one in it great ma.iiy hut probably
this suggestion will nevertheless
start the ball a rolling along the
straight ami narrow road.
Here is a combination of play
ers that might be troublesome for
their opponents no matter how
strong they might be Ward, 3rd
Sam White, ss Itippcr!on, 2nd

first class pitcher could be secur
ed and in a battle would make
a formidable opponent to any
bam and would be mighty hard
to heat. In the oullield. Whiting
Gilles, Boll. Jordan providing he
comes back to Wahpeton. Anyway
with two good pitchers .this com.
hiualio,n of players would give
anything in the .Northern League
a battle for lite and even llankin
sou might be beaten if somebody
would hit a tin -bagger. How
