D)aniels ollins. first-class baker
on the I. S. gunboat Wheeling. wasH
sadly missed for to ,lays by the
crew of that splendid craft. who had
become accllston)llld to the pastry he
mlade. so i(uh s). that that they pre
vailed uipon the collnlander of thei
good ve-~sel, :Edard Watson. to send
notice to the q ivil authorities offer
ing a reward for the retullr of the
doughmnixer-.
The police of thie eighth pr~clnet
received official notice from the
Wheeling'a comnmander and the offi
cers iirnrediately b'eganl to honey
coiimb the fifth district. C'ollins wals
regarded nir,.iy as straggier, not a
deserter, according to the official no
tice, nevertheless a reward of $2'5
was offered for his return to the
ship. It fell to the luck of Patrol
man Gravell to locate Collins at Pe
terson and Aniann streets, and he
was taken to his ship, where the re
ward was paid. Twenty per cent of
the reaarnd goes to the police pen
slon fund and the balance to the
officer.--Daily States.
