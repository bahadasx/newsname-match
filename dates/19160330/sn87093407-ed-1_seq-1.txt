SEA TILE MEN DISCUSS PREPAREDNESS
F)R a long; time, now, we have been listening; to the great American debate ah Rational preparedness. We have heard opinions of military and naval experts, famous writers, public
officials. Not so often, however, has there been any expression from the private citizen. On Monday, The Star printed an editorial on its first page entitled: "PREPAREDNESS,
THE ACID TEST OF AMERICANISM." In this article, it was sought to review in a calm manner reasons calling for preparedness. Following publication of this editorial.
The Star asked a number of citizens of Seattle, representatives of all walks and activities, to give their ideas on this great question. That it is a momentous question, is evidenced
by the fact that in nearly every case, the one addressed by The Star had a decided, definite opinion on the subject, and readily agreed to express it to the public.
Dr. Henry Suzzallo, president of the University of Washington, in a note to the editor, says: "To me, no national problem is of greater immediate importance than this matter of
Peace and preparedness. It will be well if we can direct the nation to deep thourhifulness on this supreme concern." Dr. Sydney Strong, of the Queen Anne Congregational church, one
of the leading opponents of preparedness in Seattle, especially commends The Stars idea of gaining opinions of the private citizen. "I should be greatly pleased if The Star would run a
couple of columns or so every week" he writes, "under a caption of 'The Great Debate,' in which the people would be encouraged to discuss pro and con the question of preparedness."
Dr. Strong's suggestion is a good one. The Star will be glad to devote the netded space for "The Cireat Debate" and invites its readers to discuss the question. Keep your letters short
and make them to the point. Following arc some of the letters received: ' ffill

MAY REQUIRE ALL
SCHOOL GIRLS TO

Compulsory military training for high school boys, and a
compulsory course of trained nursing and domestic hygiene
for high school girls, is provided in a bill drafted by Rep.
Victor Zednick. and made public Thursday, to be introduced
in the next session of the legislature in January.
Zednick is a member of the educational survey commis
sion, which is making a study, with the .aid ofgovernment
experts and leading educators in the country, of the rrtnf -*
tional institutions in Washington.
He will submit his measure to this commission at a meet

At th«> conference Friday, the

The course* are to be prewrlbed

the added provision that the mili

proval of the adjutant general. and
the trained nursing and domestic
hygiene cour*e shall have the ap
proval of the state board of health.
Zednlck Make* Statement
Kxplalnlng the advantage* of his
plan a* profitable to the boy* and
girls In times of peace, a* well as
aiding the program of prepared
nes*. Zednlck said:
"The measure I propose is simi
lar to that recently passed by the
legislature of New Jersey, and 1*
modeled after the Swiss system of
military training.
"The proposed enactment pro
vides for this course only in high
fvhools of an enrollment of more
than 50 boys, because the work
could not be done satisfactorily
With fewer pupils
"I think the work In nursing and
domestic hygiene for the girls will
be especially valuable to them in
every-day life.
"It will prove one ot the most
practical studies in the entire cur
riculum
"In lll>e manner, the military
training will be valuable in times
of peace. It will develop the bovs
physically, teach them how to take
care of themselves under unex
pected conditions, and be especial
ly valuable from the viewpoint of
discipline.
"The present system of competi
tive athletics offers work only to
the few who try for the teams Mil
itary training will benefit all."
