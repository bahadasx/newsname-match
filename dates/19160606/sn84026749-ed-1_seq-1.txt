Spell of Gloom Cast Over All

port of Disaster.
LONDON, June 6. Lord Kitch
ener, with his entire staff, was lost
when the British cruiser Hamp
shire was sunk in the waters north
of Scotland.
The announcement of the loss
of Kitchener and his staff was offi
cially made by the admiralty today.
ADMIRALTY STATEMENT.
The news of England's greatest
personal loss since the war, which
has stunned London, already hard
ened to shocks, was issued in the
following formal bulletin:
"The admiralty reports with
deep regret that the ship Hamp
shire, with Lord Kitchener and
his staff on board, was sunk last
night about 8 o'clock off the
Orkney Islands by a mine or a
torpedo.
Four boats were seen by
observers on the shore to
leave the ship. Heavy seas and
destroyers at once proceeded to
the scene.
The whole shore has been
searched from seaward, but
it is greatly feared that there is
little hope for any suvlvora. No
report has yet been received
from the search party on shore."
A later announcement from the
admiralty said that the searching
parties sent out in boats along the
coast had found only bodies of the
drowned and one capsized boat.
There was still the faint hope that
possibly some might have reached
shore and proceeded inland in
search of aid
ALL HOPE GIVEN UP.
On account of tho high sea, however,
this waa not considered likely, and the
admiralty did not encourage the hope
of any survivors being found.
It was stated that tho Hampshire was
on her way to Russia, where Kitchener
was to hold conferences with the of
ficials at Potrograd.
The admiralty's statement there Is
little hope that any of the members of
Kitchener's staff survived, cast a spell
of gloom over the entire nation.
The Hampshire was a British cruiser
of tho Argyll type. Her complement
was 655 officers and men. 8he was 460
feet long and displaced 10,850 tons. Her

LONDON. Juno 6. Dispatches from

nation Follow Announcement
of Disaster.
By ED. L. KEEN.
LONDON, Juno C. Public consterna
tion nnd amazement today followed tho
announcement that Lord Kitchener, and
his staff, wore sent to their deaths by a
mlno or torpedo, which blow up tho
cruiser Hampshire off tho Orkney
Islands.
Crowds gathered In Whitehall, about
tho war office, seeking further details,
following tho formal announcement of
tch loss of "K. of K."
Tho flag of the war offlco was at half
mast, and tho blinds of tho offices were
drawn.
Tho crowd received no further Infor
mation and the nlr of the officials In
dicated clearly that they hold no hope
that Kitchener might have escaped.
Surprise was expressed that u cruiser,
bearing the minister of war, could have
been destroyed cither by a toruedo or
a mlno. It Is probable that the ques
tion whether the cruiser had an escort
and whether she was provided with any
protection against submarines, will be
put directly to tho government.
Many comments wero heard In tho
crowd about tho war office. Many re-
marKea inai u was lucny u aiun i nap

RUMOR OF BOLT BY T. R.
Roosevelt Managers Deny Story
of Ultimatums Concerning
the Jurist.
By JUDSON C. WELLIVER.
CHICAGO. Juno . There was a
flurry this morning when the text of
Justice Hughes' speech at the National
Cathedral School In Washington was
made public.
Along with It camo a rumor that
Colonel Koosevelt had communicated
to his managers here that ho had de
cided not to accept Hughes, but would
take the Progressive nomination and
make a campaign If tho Republicans
nominated Hughes.
A single Chicago newspaper prlntsd
tho story of Roosevelt's ultimatum con
cerning Hughes, it did not name the
Roosexelt manager to whom this com
munication was alleged to have been
made, and thero was a. genreal opinion
that If he had such & statement to
make, at this late hour, the Colonol
would have made It In the moat open
and public way.
Denied by Managers.
The publication of the story brought
from the Roosevelt authorities here
an unqualified and Instant denial
John T. McCJrath, secretary to Colonel
Roosevolt. and George .W. Perkins
both declared flatly that thero was
absolutely n ground for such a state
ment. There had been, they said, -no com
ment of any sort suggestive of such
a view. Tho question of Colonel
Roosevelt's attitude toward anybody
that Is a candidate for the nomination
has not come up.
"Absolute bunk," was the comment
of McGrath.
"When the Colonel has anything to
say, he'll say It over his own signa
ture. He's not a pussy-footer," said
McGrath.
Doubt as to Speech.
As to Justice Hurfics' speech on "Na
tional Duty and Preparedness," It Is be
ing subjected to the most careful scru
tiny to determine whether It fills the re
quirement of the Dull Mooaers.
Opinion varied In this regard. Some
of them wero disposed to regard It as
reasonably satisfactory, but the Pro
gressives thought It fell short of their
demands,
in general, however. It was accounted

Two of Colonel's Visitors Report
Him as Likely to Back His
Former Chief;
NEW YORK, June 6. That Theodore
Roosevelt may support General Leon
ard Wood for the Republican nomina
tion If his name comes seriously be
fore the convention was the news
that reached here today from Oyster
Bay.
It came from two of the Colonel's
visitors. He made the statement to
them, they said, In the course of a
general conversation.
According tp tho Colonel's visitors,
who asked that their names be with
held, Roosevelt believes General Wood
a man eminently fitted for the labors
that will devolve upon tho noxt Presi
dent of tho United States. The Col
onel's visitors said In the event of
the nomination of Wood he would get
the continued and ardent support of
Roosevelt.
Their conversation did not Indicate
that the Colonel will jump out In
tho support of Wood Immediately, but
rather, that If tho contention ballot
ing drags and Wood climbs up In the
list Roosevelt would then hurl his
entlro strength Into tho Wood camp
In an effort to Jam him through.
Roosevelt declined to say a word on
the speech of Supreme Court Justice
Hughes. After receiving his visitors
at Oyster Bay, Roosevelt came to New
York, going first to the office of Scrlb
ner's Magazine and later to his den
tist. This afternoon he will be In his
offices at the Metropolitan Magazine
and later at the Harvard CJub to see
friends on business, but not on politi
cal business. He Intends to return to
Oyster Bay and his private telephone
line at 5 o'clock.
Until this morning Roosevelt has
been at the telephone line constantly
since Its Installation several days ago,
A secretary took up the vigil when
Roosevelt left home and through the
morning apprised the Colonel of the
moves on the Chicago political check,
erboard.

DECLARES
"Go to It," Is His Advice, Given
in Statement to Progressive
Delegates.
TIME TO BE FOR SOMEBODY
"Haven't Got It In For Anybody
or Anything," He Asserts to
Interviewers.
By H. L. RENNICK.
CHICAGO, June 6. George W.
Perkins, in a statement to Progres
sive delegates today issued a flat
ultimatum that it is Roosevelt or
no one for the Presidential nomi
nation, so far as the Progressivt-j
are concerned.
"We have no second choice. Go
to it,'' Perkins' statement con
cluded. Coming on the heels of tho
meeting of Progressive insurgents,
called by the Mississippi delega
tion last night, the statement of
Perkins created a distinct stir.
Perkins' statement follows:
"Let me remind you that we are
not here for the avowed purpose of
being against somebody. We aie
here for somebody and that some
body is Theodore Roosevelt.
"I urge you to bear this in mind
in all your conversations with
whomsoever you talk while in Chi
cago. The process of tearing down
men and things in this country and
in the world should stop.
TIME TO BUILD UP.
'"It Is time to be for somebody, for
something, and to build up. Wo haven't
got It In for anybody or anything. We
are out for a matchless man and an
Inrompirablc cause.
"You know that no one else haB such
a min, and that he Is the cause. There
fore, wo have no second choice.
"Go to It."
Perkins was asked If this means he
has no second cholco "now or from
now on."
"Now or any tlmo," was the response.
Eighteen States Join.
Delegates from eighteen Southern
nnd Western Etates headed the move
ment of deflanfo outlined by Perkins,
and wero believed to have aligned with
Ihcm Victor Munlock, rhalrmnn of the
Progressive National Commltteo; Wil
liam Allen White, Kansas Bull Mooso
chieftain, und Raymond Robins, who
will bo temporary chairman of tho Pro
gressive convention.
They havo determined on this pro
gram: Nominate Rnocovolt Trlday, tho third
day of the convention.
Run a third pary If the Republicans
refuse to accept the Colonel.
When word of the conference or th
eighteen State delegations reached Mur
dock. the Kansan declared:
"Wo will nominate ineodore Koose
velt; you maytiuote mo to that effect.'
John M. Parker, of Louisiana, state
chairman, and J, V. Hanson, of Lou
isiana, headed a temporary organiza
tion formed last night by militant
Progressives to cull a big Roosevelt
mass meeting tonight, nt which tlmo
the demand for the nomination of
Roosevelt on Friday for tho Progressive
convention will be mado.
"The Progressives of tho South havo
left the Democratic party forever," de
clared Parker, "and they will not bo
merged with the Republican party.
They want no compromlso with any
body." Speculate on HugheB.
Whether the speerh of Justice Hughes
In Washington yesterday, touching on
Americanism and like matters, would
have tho effect of meeting the Progres
sive demands for an outline of his po
sition was widely discussed this morn
ing nnd this afternoon.
While the Hughes men hailed It as
an answer to tho implied criticisms of
the soundness of tho position of the
Justice on current Issues. Progressive
party men and pro-Hoosevolt mon gen
erally hastened to attack It, and, some
of them, to deride It.
Some of the more radical of the Pro
gressives aaldi
"Wo might have supported Hughes
before, but we won't now,"
It becamo known that tho reported,
but denied, nssertlon over long distance
of Roosevelt that he would not ac
cept Hughes represented what a lot or
tho Bull Moose said In the meeting yes
terday of the Progressive national com
mittee. Many Bull Moose threats were made
at tho meeting, or rather after It, in
formally, not to accept Hughes,
