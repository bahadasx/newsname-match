account of the high sea, however, this devoid of verbal pyrotechnics, will
was not considered likely and the ad-'serve to hush Roosevelt rooters who
mlralty did sot encourage the hope
of any survivors being found.
Kb Route to Rural
It was stated that the Hampshire
was on her way to Russia, where
Kitchener was to hold conferences
with offlclala at Tetrograd.
Thla haa special significance In
view of the general Russian offensive
which is now practically under way
long the 200-mlle front from Fruth
to Kolkl. Ills trip, too, may have
ted a bearing on the advance of the
Russians Into A1a Minor.
The Hampshire was In command
of Captain Herbert J. Savllle. The
report of the loss of the ship was tele
graphed to the admiralty by Admiral
'Sir John Jelllcoe, commander of the
British horns fleet.
Ths Hampshire was a British
cruiser ot ths Argyll type. Her com
plement was 668 officers and men
-She was 450 feet long and displaced
10,850 tons. Her armament was four
"7.5-lnch guns, six 6 -Inch guns and
two torpedo tubes. ,

Some declared the Justice showed

Others pointed out that Hughes

It became known today that, while

was made to gain publicity for It.

"Now, or any time," was Perkins
response. ',
Added significance was seen In the
statement coming aa it did after the
progressives had determined to con
sider the Address made by Justice
Charles E. Hughes yesterday as no
announcement at all. v
"I am amaxed at the construction
placed upon Hughea' address to
Bchool girls," said Perkins. "It Is,
ot course, an attempt to place him in
a perfectly insincere position." 1
. Perkins agreed with Oacar Strauss,
former ambassador to Turkey, that
the address waa merely a talk that
any one would make in presenting a
flag, and did not partake in the least
of a platform. The Hughes speech
waa generally branded as "too much
like Wilson." ' .

ths announcement that Lord Kltch

blew ap the cruiser Hampshire off

. Crowds gathered in Whitehall
about the post office, seeking further
details, following the ; formal an
nounoement ot the loss of "K. of K."
, , Ths flag on the war office was at
half-mast and the Winds of the office
were drawn. , The crowd received no
further information and ths air of
ths offlclala Indicated clearly that
they held no hops that Kitchener
might have escaped. . . . "
. Surprise was expressed . that, a
cruiser bearing th minister of war

she was provided with any protection

Many comments were heard in the
crowd about the war office. Many re
marked that It "was lucky it did not

Murdock said all he could figure
from Hughes' speech ' waa that
"Hughes Is the last one to come out
tor the flag, and now everybody'a
out."
The progressives seised upon re
ports of the loss of Lord Kitchener
and his ataff' on a torpedoed -warship
as further necessity, for naming a
"strong man', Roosevelt" In Chloago.
Perkins Issued a statement along
these lines, saying ths world was
