portions of a boom.- Effort is being
made to concentrate all elements
against it and the indications are that
the veto of. the progressive party,
which, of course, means Colonel
Roosevelt's disapproval of - Hughes,
may De sought as a check. -
Harmony Desire of Leaders..
Harmony above everything else is
the desire of the leaders. Without it
any nominee would not answer the
purpose, because it Is recognized that
unless the republicans and progress
sives get together their chance of suc
cess at the polls Is very sHm. To ob
tain harmony, the republican leaders
are willing to concede - to Colonel
Roosevelt the veto power In some
form. Some of the leaders say he
should be willing to select one or two
men who would be acceptable to him
from the list of candidates in the field.
Others think he should suggest men
for consideration by convention lead
ers and virtually all of the party
chiefs are willing to admit that any
of the candidates definitely rejected by
L-oionei Kooeevelt could not be nomi
nated. . ... .. .',-...
"nexpectea urowtnT- nugi.es Boom,
Tmnartial ohsi-ver ' within th re

the unexpected growth of the- Hughes
boom Is necessarily an indication of
personal popularity of the justice
among the delegates. Those who pro
moted it in opposition to what proved
to be an exaggerated estimate of the
expected demand for the nomination of
Roosevelt were surprised at its -growth.
The Individual candidates were work
ing independently and therefore there
was no canvass of the extent to which
Hughes was the second choice of their
supporters. This was found to be far
more . general than had been antic! -

Hughes Sentiment Reaches High Tide.
With the arrival of hundreds of del
egates today the sentiment in favor
of Hughes reached liigh tide and in
spite of - the concentration upon him
of the opposition forces he appears to
be far in the lead.' Managers of the
favorite' son candidates have made no
headwap to combine against Hughes
because .he is the second choice of
many of the instructed delegates and
trading is dangerous. (Every attempt
ed transfer, it Is feared, would result
In spilling some delegates into the
Hughes basket. Unless the situation
changes very soon, these delegates are
almost certain to flop to him should
there be more than two or three bal
lots without a nomination -
No Pre-Convention Statement
All thought of getting a" pre-conven
tion statement from Justice Hughes
was abandoned during the day. The
so-called smoking-out processes were
unsuccessful, similar efforts were di
rected tonight against the Roosevelt
people and a demand was made that
the colonel either should come here
and take part in the councils or place
his spokesman in a position where
they could answer questions of the so
called allies as to" what candidate or
candidates would be acceptable to
him to defeat Hughes.: It was not be
lieved that any of these demands
would be met.
Roosevelfs Presence Desired.
Many- of the Roosevelt adherents
i themselves believed the colonel should
come to Chicago. His presence, . they
thought, would obviate all danger of
the progressive national convention
getting beyond control. - Strangely
enough, "the old guard leaders would
Welcome Colonel. Roosevelt . at this
time, as they would prefer to deal
with him directly rather than through
representatives and some of them ar
gued that if he could be induced to
come here a union of the republicans
and progressives would be assured.
