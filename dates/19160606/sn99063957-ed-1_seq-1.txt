The main base of the British high

Considered probable also that he was
engaged in conference with other high

followed to meet any move from Ger

One cable report was that Kitche

If this bo true, it has special signifi

have had a bearing on the advance Of

A later announcement from the ad

sent out in boats along the coast had

faint hope that possibly some might
have reached shore and proceeded in

Hughes before the graduating class of
the National Cathedral school yester
day to Buit their owu hopes and be

plainly that if the republican conven
tion nominated him on the first few
ballots and without any hurly burly
free for nil, he would accept. They
said his address, brief as it was, was
devoid of verbal pyrothenics, will serve
to hush Roosevelt rooters who have
been declaring no one knows where
Hughes stands, "even on the big is
sue of Americanism."
Others pointed out that Hughes
agreed to speak wt Hie exercises last
fall to plcnso his daughter, who is a
member of the graduating class, that
what he said would have been suid by
any other Americnn, especially at this
time. They argiu d that if Justice
Hughes had the remotest idea of ac
cepting a platter-delivered presiden
tial nomination, he purposely overlook
ed an opportunity tc deliver a "spread
eagle" speech iu presenting the United
States flag to the graduate who stood
highest in her cIubs.
Frequently importuned during tho
day for a statement, Hughes' secre
tary, Lawrence Green, this afternoon
pointed out that tho justice hud agreed
to speak at the exercises Inst full and
that ho "was not spueaking for politi
cal purposed."
Senator Jones, republican of Wash

porter, said he didn't believe the
speech hud any political significance.
"It was just the speech of any pa

such an occasion, It won't affect the

nominated at Chisago."
Democratic congressmen, while rcfus-
ing to comment ptwi.ciy today on the
speech of Justice Hughes,
privately
claimed to resent the action. One mem
ber of the lower house snid the lenst
that could be said of it was that the in

By HL. Rennick
(I'nited Press staff correspondent)
Chicago, Juno (I. George W. Per
kins, in a statement to progressive del
egates today issued a flat ultimatum
tli m it is Roosevelt or no one lor the
presidential nomination, so far as the
progressives are concerned.
"We have no second choice."
"Go to it," Perkin's statement con
cluded. Coming on the heels of the meeting
of the progressive insurgents, called
iy the Mississippi delegation bust
night, the statement of Perkins areated
a distinct stir,
Perkin's statement fallows:
"Let me remind you that wo are not
here for the avowed purpose of beiu
against somebitdy. We are hero lor
somebody and that somebody is Theo
dore Roosevelt. ,
"I urge you to bear in mind in all
your conversations, with whomsoever
you tulk while iu ( hicugo. The pu
cess of tearing down men and things
in this country and in the world should
stop. It is time to be for somebody,
for some thing and to build up. We
have not got it iu for anybody or any
thing. We are out lor a mntchless man
and un incompaiable enin'o.
Have No Snoinil Choice
"You know that no one cIbb has
such u man nnd that he is tho cause.
Therefore, wo have no second choice.
"Go to it."
Perkins was asked if he means ho
had no second choice "now or from
now on.
"Now, or any lime," was the re
sponse.
Added significance was seen in tne
statement, coiuu-g ns it did after the
progression and detiinind to .oiwader
the address made by .justice Charles
E. Hughes yesterday as no announce
ment at all.
"I am amazed nt tho construction
placed upon Hughes' address to school
girls," nu'hl Perkins. "It is, of course,
an attempt to place linn in a perfectiy
insincere position.''
Perkins agreed with Oscar Strauss,
former ambassador to Turkey that the
the nddrcM was merely a talk that any
one would miIKe in presenting oii
mill diil not partake iu tho least of u
platform. The Hughes' swech was
generally branded us "too much like,
Wilso I."
