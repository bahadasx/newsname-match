TEDDY WAITING
FOR RESULTS
(By Aeeoelated Press.)
LONDON, June 6. General Kitchener was en route to Russia,
and probably intended to disembark at Archangel. The Hampshire
carried normally 655 men.
Admiral Jellicoe'i report says : "The Hampshire "with" General
Kitchener and staff was sunk at eight o'clock last night west of the
Orkneys, either by striking a mine or the impact of a torpedo. Patrol
vessels were sent out to search for survivors. Some bodies in a cap
sued boat were found. The whole shore was searched and there is
little hope that any survivors may be found."
The allies had confidence in Kitchener's judgment. His visits
to France and Italy were supposed to Iihvp liad important results in
eo-ordinatiiiK the work of t he allies. The fact that he was en route to
Russia is taken as an indication tliHt he was bound on a similar mis
sion. The first intimation of his trip came with the announcement
that he was lost. Naval officers expressed the opinion that the Hamp
shire struck a mine, uh the lioat was fast and the sea too rough for
a torpedo. J . ' -
Accompanying Kitchener as his staff were: -
HUGH O'BEIRNE, ex-chancellor of the British embassy at Pet-rograd.
0. A. FITZGERALD, Kitchener's private military secretary.
BRIGADIER GENERAL ELLERSHAW.
SIR FREDERICK DONALDSON.
When the news was received of the loss of the head of the Bri
tish war office a meeting of the war council was called.
Sir William Robertson, chief of the imperial army staff, probably
will become the new secretary of war.

Of several things tlial entitle Earl
Kitchener to a place In world his
tory, the most notable is that he or
ganized the largest volunteer army the
world has even seen, in the greatest
war of all times.
Within a year from the sudden out
break of the European war In August,
1914, the ranks ot British fighting men
were quadrupled by an Increase from
less than one million to nearly 5,
000,000. . ,
By mere luck Kitchener happened to
be in England on one of the com
paratively rare vlsita lliat ne had paid
to London during his long career
abroad, when the European war broke
out. He had just come home from
service as British agent in Egypt, had
accepted an Kurldom from King
George, and was being talked of as
Viceroy of India. , Within a few hours
after England's declaration of war,
Kitchener was appointed secretary of
stale for war and immediately took
full charge at the war office where
he worked day and night to overcome
the hnndlcap which the central powers
had over England In the matter of

He grimly told the British people
they had a bigger war on their hands
than they realized, and one that might
last longer than they expected, but It
was to be faced with entire confidence
and he, unsmiling, almost like a de
humanized machine, set about to make
things hum. He had scarcely moved
into Whitehall street when he made
numerous changes in the personnel
of the war office, which was said to be
honeycombed with social and politi
cal favoritism.!
After dispatching a few hundred
thousand regulars to Prance and Bel
glum to help check the onrushing Ger
mans, the war secretary began re
cruiting and organizing his army ot

SAIITA ROSA BE III
SHIPPING FROM
The Santa Rosa mine which is part
ly owned by the West End Consoli
dated Mining company of Tonopah is
rapidly developing into a property
of the first magnitude and at the pre
sent rate of progress through the oper
ation of leasers it will take a very
short time to place the mine In good
shape for the company to handle.
Three weeks ago, leases were granted
to two different parties, both of whom
have succeeded beyond their bright
est expectations. Two men on one
lease opened four feet of ore almost
at grass roots and in the first two
weeks took out 40 tons of $50 rock
Another lease, by Holland and com
pany, which began at the same time
working on a four foot vein, took out
between thirty and forty tons of high
grade, valued at between $60 and $70
One man, on company account, in
twenty days sacked twenty tons of
$35 ore.
The property is sptenoidly equipped
with fine array of surface improve
ments Including boarding house, kit
chen, dining room, assay office, black
smith shop and aft appurtenances
adapted to the operation of the pro
perty, which promises to open a
large ore body.
Nevertheless very little work ot an
exploratory character was done as a
change of management led to a tem
porary cessation. Since the first of
the year the owning Interests have
been seriously thinking of renewing
the attack in the most approved man
ner but, before entering on an aggres
sive campaign, it was deemed wiser
to test the resources without incurring
any great expense. That explains
