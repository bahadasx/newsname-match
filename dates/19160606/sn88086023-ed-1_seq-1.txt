TEUTON VESSELS
Senior Officer With English Fleet
Declares That Germans Narrowly
Escaped Being Utterly Destroy
ed.
LONDON. June C. "Only phenom
ernal luck saeo the German fleet
from utter destruction In the battle
.-kagerak," a senior officer command
ing a British cruiser, told the United
Press. He said: "The Germans had
all the advantages. It was blowing
bard in their direction and the sun
was at our back, silhouetting our ships
and making splendid targets.
"The firing began at 20,000 yards.
We engaged five German battle cruis
ers. There was hot fighting from the
tart with the water mil of bursting
shells. 1 could see our shells hitting
the Germans plainly and doing great
damage The strategic plan was to
cut the Germans off from their base.
We had accomplished this when a
mist began settling, giving the Ger
mans a ohahce to escape. They were
more than anxious to quit. Only two
battle cruisers were still firing when
the mist settled.
"Our men entered the battle fear
lessly and fought with wonderful
coolness throughout. The Warspitc
entered the engagement with a brok.
en propeller. It circled helplessly
under a horrible fire. Other British
ships came to its aid and engaged the
Germans shelling It The Warspite
Dually escaped under a protective
fire. The loss was small and the
damage easily repaired. We are more
ban anxious to repeat the engage
ment under similar circumstances,
trusting that luck will not all go one
way next time. It is certain, however,
that the enemy's losses were heavier
:han ours."

Warship Hampshire Strikes Mine
or Torpedo North of Scottish
Coast; Entire Staff Believed
to Have Perished; Were
on Way to Russia
LONDON, June 6. The admiralty announced today that
Lord Kitchener, minister of war, with his entire staff, was lost
when the cruiser Hampshire was sunk north of Scotland.
A torpedo or a mine struck the Hampshire which was taking
Kitchener to Russia, probably to confer with the czar's military
leaders regarding a concerted offensive along all fronts.
The following is the admiralty's report:
"The admiralty reports with deep regret that the
ship Hampshire, with Kitchener and his staff on
board, was sunk last night about 8 o'clock off the Ork
ney islands by a mine or a torpedo. Four boats were
' seen from the shore leaving the ship. A heavy sea
was running. Patrol vessels and destroyers proceed
ed to the scene. The whole shore was searched but
it is greatly feared that there is little hope of sur
vivors." It was later announced that searching parties had found only
the bodies and one capsized boat There is still faint hope that
some reached the shore and proceeded inland in search of aid.
On account of the high sea this, however, was considered am
likely and the admiralty did not encourage hope.
The Hampshire was a cruiser of the Argyll type with a com
plement of 655 officers and men. It displaced 10,850 tons. Its
armament consisted of four 71 '2 inch and six 6 inch guns and
two torpedo tubes. Captain Herbert Vavill was in command.
MEMBERS OF STAFF.
NEW YORK, June 6. The monthly army list gives Kitche
ner's executive staff as follows: Private Secretaries, H. J. Cree

onel William Norrie ; Civil Assistant, R. H. Moore.
It was doubted here whether the official staff accompanied
Kitchener.
