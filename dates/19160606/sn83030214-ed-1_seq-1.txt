TENSION AMONG LEADERS
Both Roosevelt and Hughes Booms Benefit
as "Old Guard" Makes New Effort
to Get Together.
[Fmm a Staff Correspondcnt of The Tribune.]
Chicago. June 5.?Action by tho Progressive National Com?
mittee to-day to insure that the Progress ives would allow ample
! ime for reaching an understanding with the Republicans caused
an easing of the tension among the politicians here. At the
same time the Hughes stock took a boom as ? result of the
Progressives' announcement that they might accept him, but
would take no one else so far suggested, except Roosevelt.
There was a gain during the day, too. for Rool and for
: Roosevelt in sniping incoming delegates. but not enough to
< I ave any material effect on the situation.
Several conferences between "old guard" Republicans and
, George W. Perkins to-night gave rise to a report that efforts
were being made to agree upon a eompromise candidate who
would be acceptable to both the Republican leaders and the Pro
gressives. Those who conferred with .Mr. Perkins at his apart
ment in the Blackstone where Charles D. Hilles. chairman of the
Republican IVational Committee; .Senator Reed Smoot. William
B. .McKinley. of Illinois, one of the Sherman managers; Senator
Boies Penrose. of Pennsylvania. and Senator Henry Cabot
Lodge. of Massaehusetts. Senator Lodge is one of the framers
of the Republican platform. and this added considerable signifi
i cance to his conference with .Mr. Perkins.
Conferrees Won't Talk.
None of the conferrees would discuss what had taken place
in their meeting except to say that the general situation had
In'on diseussed. It was said, however. that the names of several
prospective nominees had been diseussed, among them ex-Sen
uror Philander Knox. of Pennsylvania; Senator Warren G. Hard
mg. of Ohio. the temporary chairman of the convention; former
Yice-President Charles W. Fairbanks. and Senaior John W.
\Vppks. of Massaehusetts.
