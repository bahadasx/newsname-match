confidence that Colonel Roosevelt will
not have votes enough to obtain tho
Republican nomination. Thoy are
satisfied, too, that he can not under
any circumstances stampede tho con
vention. Tho task that the big flg
tires in the Republican party have
assigned to themselves is to convince
Colonel Roosevelt and his followers
that these are hard, cold, indisputa
ble facts. They believe that when
they "nave once convinced the Roose
velt people that there is no chance of
the colonel being nominated by the
Republican convention the way will
be paved for an informal understand

mon nominee for president.
Statements by Progressive leaders
made it clear that of all the candi
dates now in the field only Colonel
Roosovelt and Justice Hughes will be
acceptable to the Bull Mooscrs. and
fhe latter only in the event of his
publicly subscribing to the views on
"Americanism" and "preparedness"
held by the Progressives. These state
ments were regarded as intended to
eliminate the soalled favorite sona
from the situation.
In other words, the situation here
is resolving itself, according to some
of the leaders, more and more into
one where Colonel Roosevelt will pos
sess a practical veto power over the
Republican nominee. All of the Re
publican leaders are for harmony.
They are willing, it is said, to make

In fact, tho Fairbanks people have
taken heart from the reports that Mr.

El Paso, Tex., June 5. Consterna
tion was created along the Mexican
border and throughout northern Mex
ico by news from Mexico City that
Emlllano Zapata and his forces are
pressing their attacks hard against
the Mexican capital, which was fol
lowed by confidential orders to the
Ccnerals commanding Carranza forces
to hold themselves in readiness to
dispatch south any troops they can
spare if called upon to do so.
The sudden daring of tho Zapatis
tas In pressing so close against the
Mexican capital may result In toe
withdrawal of many of the Mexican
troops Tecently rushed into northern
Chihuahua, ostensibly to put down
banditry. This would greatly relieve
the strain now existing between the
United States and the Carranza gov
ernment over the question of the
withdrawal of American forces from
Mexico.
In the event of necessity for with
drawing Carranza forces to protect
the national capital, it is expected
that the de facto government will
realize the value of allowing the
American forces to remain to protect
the bandit ridden regions, and that
the Mexican foreign department will
tor the time neglect to press Its de
mands for the withdrawal of the
Americans.
The situation develops just at a
time when the Carranza forces were
being redlsposed In such a manner as
to take over all the bandit hunting
work of the American forces where
this could possibly be done. In the
event ot withdrawing any of the de
facto troops for duty In protecting
Mexico City, the forces nearest to the
American troops will be sent south,
It Is stated, giving the Americans a
wider latitude.
That the Carranzlstas are sincere
In their efforts to prevent clashes be
tween their troops and those of the
American army of occupation was in
dicated by an order published to his
forces by General Gavlra that any sol

punished by death.

Official Stories Of Battle Arc
Very Conflicting
English Claim German Losses
Were Heavier Than British.
BERLIN STANDS BY ITS REPORT
British Admiralty's Estimate Would
Bring the German Losses In the
Great Naval Battle Up to Even Be
yond the Losses Sustained by the
English Fleet Rear Admiral Beat
ty'e Feat,
London, June E. Vice Admiral Sir
David Beatty, it is stated, lost his
three battle cruisers in Wednesday's
great naval battle in a daring attempt
to hold the German fleet so It could
he destroyed by the British dread
noughts speeding to his aid. He
fought the German high seas fleet
with his comparatively small squad
ron, exchanging shots at close range,
and only the coming o! night and a
heavy mist Just as the British battle
fleet arrived saved the Germans.
British naval experts gave this
opinion of the battle and praised the
daring and wonderful strategy of Ad
miral Beatty in attacking such a pow
erful enemy.
Could Admiral Sir John Jellicie
have brought his dreadnoughts Into
the battle an hour sooner, they hold,
the German fleet would have been
clearly and severely defeated. As It
-was. they escaped under cover of
darkness just as the main British
fleet arrived on the scene.
The British admiralty gave out a
statement declaring that pending the
compilation of details of last Wednes
day's North sea battle these facts
have been positively established:
"The German reports of the battle-
! are false. The German losses were
heavier than the British, not merely
in proportion, but positively."
A German admiralty statement was -
received here asserting that the Ger
man fleet suffered no losses beyond
those admitted in the official account.
Admiralty's Claim.
While the British admiralty does
not cite positive facts to support its
assertion that the German losses wre
heavier than the British, It declares
that "there seems to be the strongest
ground for supposing that the follow
ing units were lost by the Germans.
Two battleships, two dreadnought
battle cruisers of the most powerful
type, two light cruisers of the latsst
i type (Wiesbaden and Elblng), one
I light cruiser of the Rostock type, the
j light cruiser Prauenlob, at least nine
destroyers, and one submarine.
This would make a total of eight
warships, nine destroyers and one
submarine, a grand total of eighteen
vessels, as against only six warships
and eight destroyers a grand total
of fourteen vessels admittedly- tost
by the British.
The German declaration that no fur
ther losses were suffered than those'
announced means that the kaber's ad
miralty insists that the battle cost
Germany only three warships and a
number of torpedo craft. The British
claim, if verified, would bring the
German loss In tonnage, thus far as
serted by Berlin to be only 49,000,
well up to or even beyond the British
loss of 125,000 tons.
By way of emphasizing that th
main body of the British grand fleet
made a clean sweep of the N'orth se.i
waters, once it appeared on the sceno,
the British admiralty relates that hxc
John Jellico "having driven the ene
my Into port," returned to the main
scene of tho action and stayed there.
The official list of casualties shows
that hardly a single officer of tho line
escaped from the British cruisers
sunk in the battle. An additional cas
ualty list of petty officers shows that"
43 of them escaped from the Queen
Mary, Invincible. Fortune, Ardent, and
Shark. None was saved from the In
defatigable, Defense, Black Prince,
Tipperary, Turbulent, Nomad or Nes
tor. The list gives the names of C5
men killed aboard the Warrior and
27 men wounded. On the other ships
engaged in the flgnt 115 men were
killed and 85 wounded. It Is estimat
ed that 10 000 British nnd German
seamen perished in the battle.
