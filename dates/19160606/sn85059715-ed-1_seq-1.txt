Of several things (hat entitle Earl
Kitchener to a place in world history.
the most notable Is that ho
argunlaed the lament volunteer army
the world Una ever seen, In the
greatest war of all times.
Within a yar from the sudden
outbreak of the European war in
August, 191-1, the ranks of British
fighting rnon were quadrupled by an
Increase from less than one million
to nearly 4.000.000.
All other great powars that entered
the war had huge standing armies
and compulsory military service.
Great Britain alono faced the Issu with
confidence that Ita people would
readily respond to the call of king
and country without compulsion,
and the precipitous developments
that led to the war found both the
mouB in tho verdict that Kitchener <>f
Khartum was the man to lead in the
recruiting and organization ot the
necessary army.
It wat not a sentimental clamor,
for though Kitchener was a proven
hero of many campaigns, his personality
was :ih impenetrable as hardened
steel, and he wis not a hero that
could 'be loved; even the war office
had no pronounced liking for hint,
^ but on all sides there was profound
respect for hi' military ellicioncy and
for all he had done to ? xtend the <!<?
maim- of the British empire.
By mere luck Kitchener happened
to be in England on one of the comparatively
rare visits that hi4 had
paid to London during his Ions
career abroad, when the European
war broke out. lie had Just come
home from service as British agent
in Egypt, had accepted an earldom
form King (ieorge, and was being
talked of as viceroy or India. Within
n few hours after England's declaration
of war. Kitchener was appointed
secretary of state for war and
immediately took full charge at tlm
war office, where he worked day and
night to overcome the handicap*
which the Central powers had over
England in the matter of fighting
strength.
Ho grimly told the British people
that they had a bigger war on
their hands than they realised, and

expected, but It wm to be laced with

with social and political favoritism.
After dispatching a few hundred
thousand regulars to Franco and Belj'lum
to help chock the onrushlng
Germans, the war secretary began recruiting
and organizing his army of

with signs and posters urging
young men to Join the colors. Kitchener

that about 3.000,000 men had

Kitchener, however, was the object
of no little criticism. There was
much grumbling because of the strict
censorship h*? imposed on newspapers
and his utter disregard for w-ar
correspondents. Notwithstanding this
tho Itritish newspapers gave him
active support prior to May. 191r?.
During the wlntor months the war
secretary had announced the "bier

this was the beginning of the

reached England that the drive had

father was a soldier, but of no very
high rank. He had managed to climb
to the Lioutonniu-c.olonel of a dra
good r? giment, whon he retired to
the estate in Ireland where Horatio
Kitchener, the lobe-distinguished
sou. was born. Young Kitchener re
received his fundamental military
education at Woolwich, whore in displayed
only ordinary brilliancy, with
the exception of his liking for mathematics.
On graduating !? received
a coinnii .-lot, in the Koyul Kugiuors.
but when nut yet 21 years of age. he
attached himself to it hVencli army ill
the Franco-Prussian war. He had
been in the service only a short time
when lie contracted pneumonia during
a balloon tliffhl ami bad n
prolonged and serious illness that he*
had to give up further service for
France. Kitchener's experience In
European warfare?prior to his direction
of the great war of 1914?
therefore, had been limited only to a
few bnlloon flights in France.
In 1874 when a British expedition
was sent out to survey Western Palestine.
Kitchener was one of the eager
volunteers accepted for this service.
Foi months he traveled over the hills
.and valleys of this peaceable Bible
land with his thoodolluta and surve\
ing tape, and with this life In the
open he grew to bo a tall, gaunt
subaltern with a hard face well burned.
His contribution to the topo-1
graphical knowledge to the Hnlv 1
Land completed, young Kitchener
i was Bent to (,'yprun which llreat Ilii'
tain had just acquired. to organize a
system of courts, a work in which he
displayed administrative ability aud
tact. It was while thero, in 188:..
that he took his first Rtep on the path
that was to lead him eventually to
j Khartum. Trouble waa alreudy brewing
in the Sudan. Hearing that
the Egyptian array waa being organized
by Sir Evelyn Wood, young
Kitchener saw his opportunity with
j unerring Instinct and lost no time In
: offering his services. The military I
authorities, reclgnozlng at once his
insight Into the native character, put
him in the Intelligence department,
and from the very outHot of his Eyp!
tlan career negotiations of the ut-(
most importance wore entrusted to j
him and carried out with invariable !
success Ah an intelligence officer,1
Kitchener accompanied Sir Herbert
aiowari'H aonort column on that herole
but disastrous enterprise known ,
as tho Gordon llollcf Expedition
the belief of General Gordon from
Khartum where he had been entangled
during the evacuation of the Sudan.
Kitchener deeply took to heart
tho lessons of the flacso. with Ifh
failure of transport and Intelligence
departments, and avoided these
troubles in the expedition which he
himself led so mo yea re later. In tho'
* meantime Kitchener was employed In
Innumerable fights and raids against
tho dervishes or Mahrllsts of South- j
em Egypt. In 1886 ho became gov-1
ernor of the Red sea territories and
set In motion a series of raids on the
I notorious Osman Plena, the dervish .
leader. In ono of those raids Kltch-1
oner's men were flanked and put to'
flight during which he received aj
bullet which broke hl9 Jaw.
By this time much was heard in
England of Kitchener's work In
Egypt and when he returned there
for a short rest he was received with I
honor and nominated alde-de-cainpe I
of Queen Victoria. With his health '
recruited, he went back to Egypt, on 1
the resignation of Sir Francis Grne-I
fell, he was appointed Sirdar 'com-1
mnrider) of the Egyptian army. His j
really great career dates from that
time. .
As an Instance of the self-confidence
with which Kitchener undertook
his tasks in Egypt is recalled
how he dealt with the war office a
! few generals before hint ever dared. \
On ono occasion he sent home for a i
special kind of gun. The war office I
suggested another kind. The Sirdar i
repeated his orders. Next ho was ,
Informed that the war office guns had !
been forwarded, whereupon he dis[patched

"without stomach. heart or back

thet . helpl*. s reeds of hr?>k?-n natives
and made of them home of the tlnoat
of black battalions.
Tim tight at Omdurmun, September
2. 18U8, Just across the Nile from
Khartum, was the Kreatoat battle of
Kitchener'n time in Egypt. Osnian ;
I'ignu faced him with 50,000 Malidints,
while he had hut 20,000 mem.
When the battle was over, J 1,000 of.
the Mahdlsts had been killed out-.
right, id,00o wounded, and 4,000
taken prisoner, while the English and
Ki'Vtil ian Iomh ultmrothor wau iitwlor i

With tin- capture of Khartum, the
capital of the .Sudan, which meruit
the re -establishment "f British poascsslon
of these uppei reucln-i Of the
Nile, Kitchener became the object
ot hero-worship in Kngland. Hie
campaign hud been, and is to this day,
much criticized, however, because of
itH rutbleHftneHH. It was churned
Kitchener 11ampled on hi. foes in art
almost harharious munnet. On his
return to Knglund, however, ho was
generous enough to ask his countrymen
to found a college at Khartum
wherein the sons of 'he ?. r. luh chiefs
ho had fought and overwhelmed j
might ho educated in the knowledge '
of the West, a request that met with 1
such response among the British people
tlint the fund required was far
over subscribed.
For his triumphs in the Sudan he
was raised to the peerage ar. Baron
Kitchener of Khartum, and received
the thanks of Parliament and a grant
of 1150,000. Shortly afterward he
was promted to lieutenant-general
nnd then chief of staff to Lord Bob.
oris in the South African war. and on
Lord Ilob(*rtK'B return to England in
November. IflbO, succeeded him as
commnnder-ln-chlof of thai field. By
constructing a 3.300 mile chain of
block houses he -topped the Boer
rnldH and virtually ended the war in
South Africa. Thin added to his popularity
and prestige at home, and ho
wtis rewarded by the title of Viscount
promotion to the rank of general for
distinguished services, the thanks of
the Parliament and a grant of $250.- J
0O0.
Immediately after the pence Gener-!
al Kitchener went to India as commander-in-chief
of the British forces.
and In thin position which he held for
seven years, he carried out not only
many far-reaching administrative reforms
but u complete reorganization
and strategical redistribution of the
British and native forces. On leaving
India in 19 09 he was prompted
field marshal and appointed commander
in chief and high commissioner in j
the Mediterranean, nnd later on took :
a tour of inspection of the forces of
the entire empire, drawing up a
scheme of defense of the overseas
dominions.
He then return to Egypt, the scene

DAL WAVE
THE STATE I
gered Lilly's managers, who called
a hasty council of war to devise
some way of rallying their routed
forces. Their campaign has completely
relapsed and desperate means
were discussed to revise It.
Lilly men in McDowell county
have given up the light there. They
havo abandoned all hope ot saving
the state ticket and are exerting all
their resources and energies to savo
the county candidates. Robinson
will carry the county by at least t.000
aocordlng to reports.
Cabell county will give Judge Robinson
not lets than 1.000 majority. *
Kanawha oounty will add apprmd- raately
1,500 to the total. Fayette
county will be close with the odds In
favor of the Taylor county candidate.
Mercer, which was believed to
be a Lilly strong hold, will also be
close, and It Is said that considerable
opposition has developed In his
home county ot Raleigh. It Is notll
conceded that he will carry bis own
bailiwick. Mingo county will return
a majority of 1.500 for the
Grafton Jurist. A tremendous rrowttv
of Robinson sentiment Is uotlced Iq
every one ot the southern. eoontlse* .
