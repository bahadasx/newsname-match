Special to the Telegraph
Chicago. June 6. Through the
rlri/.zle of an eastern storm, with
some prospects of snow, comes
one outstanding definite purpose—
the determination of the leaders
of the Republican party here as
sembled to nominate a candidate
who will embody all of the best
traditions of the party, and who
will be sale and sane through the
erisis which is now upon the coun
try.

Chicago. June 6.—Political leaders
who profess to be willing to accept
any man for the presidential nomina
tion who is able to command the sup
port of both Republicans and Progres
sives are trying to-day to determine
whether Justice Hughes lias been
strengthened or weakened by the tem
porary concentration of all forces
upon hint with the avowed purpose
of eliminating Colonel Roosevelt as a
Republican possibility. Unciuestion-
Rhly the effect of the Hughes drive
has been to place the whole Held of
candidates against him.
Conferences between Republican

KITCHENER AND
STAFFGODOWN
ON BIG CRUISER
I
FIELD MARSHAL EARL KITCHENER
1 . ]
British Minister cf War, His Aids, and 655 Sailors on
Board Hampshire Perish When Vessel Hits Mine or
Is Torpedoed by Germans Off Orkney Islands on Way
to Russia; All Great Britain Is Mourning Loss
Great Britain to-day is mourning; the loss of her most noted
military chieftain. Field Marshal Earl Kitchener, head of the British
War Office.
Earl Kitchener, with members of his staff were on board the
British cruiser Hampshire, sunk last night off the Orkney Islands,
and it seems certain that he, with all others on board the warship,
have been lost.
Admiral Jellicoe, reporting on the sinking of the Hampshire;
says she was sent to the bottom "either by a mine or a torpedo."
Only some bodies and a capsized boat had been found, the Admiral's
j dispatch announced. While four boats were reported to have got
i away, he expressed little hope that there were any survivors.
,1 Lord Kitchener and his staff were on their way to Russia,
, | probably making for the port of Archangel. Supposedly they intended
:' to consult the Russian military authorities regarding the Russain
i offensive expected to relieve the Teutonic pressure on Verdun and
: 1 the Italian front.
London dispatches indicate that the probability that Sir William
Jj Robertson, chief of the Imperial army staff, who is in London, will
, | become the secretary of war.
Capsized Boat Found
Four boats were seen to leave the
Hampshire but a heavy sea was run
ning. Only a capsized boat and some
bodies have been found.
Earl Kitchener was on his way to
Russia. Admiral Jellicoe reports there
is little hope that there were any sur
vivors.
The names of the members of Earl
Kitchener's staff have not yet been
learned. Sir William Robertson, chief
i of the Imperial staff, is in London.
Admiral Jellieoe's Report
i Admiral Jellicoe, commander of the
j British grand fleet, has reported to the
| Admiralty that the British cruiser
Hampshire with Earl Kitchener and
his staff aHoard, has been lost off the
West Orkneys.
Admiral Jellieoe's report to the Ad
miralty follows:
"I have to report with deep regret
that His Majesty's Ship Hampshire,
Captain Herbert J. Savill, R. N., with
Lord Kitchener and his staff on board,
was sunk last night at about 8 p. m.
to the west of the Orkneys, either by a
mine or a torpedo.
I "Four boats were seen by observers
lon shore to leave the ship. The wind
j was north and northwest and heavy
I seas were running. Patrol vessels and
i destroyers at once proceeded to the
j Spot and a party was sent along the
; coast to search, but only some bodies
land a capsized boat have been .found
'up to the present. As the whole shore
has been searched from the seaward,
[ I greatly fear that there is little hope
of there being any survivors.
"No report has yet been received
from the search party on shore.
"Hampshire was on her way to Rus
sia."
Robertson May Succeed Him
When the news of the sinking of the
cruiser Hampshire with Earl Kitch
ener and his staff on board was re
ceived in London a meeting of the
British council was Immediately called.
Sir William Robertson, chief of the
Imperial staff, who probably will be
come the head of the war office; Sir
Edward Grey, secretary of foreign af
fairs; Reginald McKenna. chancellor
of the exchequer, and David-Lloyd'
George, minister of munitions, were
present at the council.
The newspaper reporters at the war
office who at the time had not heard
the news regarding Earl Kitchener,
announced:
"Neither Earl Kitchener nor- Pre
mier Asquith was present."
Carrieil Heavy Load
Premier Asquith paid a high tribute
to Earl Kitchener's work In his speech
at the recent adjournment of parlia
ment, saying no other man could have
raised the great armies which
Kitchener assembled.
It. has been recognized that there i
was placed on the war secretary's
shoulders a load it was impossible for j
one man to bear. In the early part of j
the war he was responsible for not
only the organization of armies, but i
tvr the enormous work of equipping j
them and supplying them with mu
| nitions. Since David Lloyd-George
j took charge of the munitions depart
j irent Earl Kitchener had been able
I to devote himself more largely to the
worlf of military organization.
Great Britain's allies had great con
fidence in Earl Kitchener's judgment.
His visits to France and Italy were
I supposed to have had important re
j suits In co-ordinating the work of the
I allies. The fact that he had left Lon
| don for Russia is regarded as an in
i d'eation that he was on a similar mis
-1 sion to that country. The first intima
tion came in the bulletin announcing
that he had been lost.
Distinguished Men Aboard
Accompanying Earl Kitchener was
his staff, who were Hugh J. O'Bierne
former councillor of the British Em
bassy at Petrograd and former minis
ter at Sofia; O. A. Fitzgerald, Earl
Kitchener's private military secretary;
! Brigadier General Ellershaw and Sir
Frederick Donaldson.
.Many Minor Army Officers
On board the Hampshire with
Kitchener were also a number of
minor army officers. Sir Hay Freder
ick Donaldson, among those who ac
jcompanied Lord Kitchener on the
j Hampshire, was technical adviser to
David Llord-Georg.e minister of mu
nitions. He was prominent in the en
gineering world, being a past president
of the Institute of Mechanical En
