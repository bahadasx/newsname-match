LONDON, June 6.—The admiralty today an
nounced the death of Lord Kitchener and his entire
staff.
The party was aboard the British cruiser Hamp
shire, north of Scotland.
Either a torpedo or mine struck the cruiser, which
was taking Kitchener to Russia, probably to confer
with the czar's military leaders regarding a concert
ed offensive. Following was the admiralty report:
"The admiralty reports deep regret that the ship
Hampshire, with Lord Kitchener and his staff
aboard, was sunk about 8 o'clock last night off the
Orkney islands by a mine or torpedo.
"Four boats were seen from shore leaving the
ship. Heavy seas were running.
"Patrol vessels and destroyers proceeded to the
scene.
"The whole shore has been searched from the sea
ward, but it is greatly feared there is little hope for
the survivors."
It was announced that searching parties had found
only a number of dead bodies and one capsized boat.
There is still a faint hope that some of the surviv

TACOMA. WASH.. TUESDAY^JUNEg. 1916.
Crowdg gathered in Whitehall
about the postoffice, seeking fur
ther details, following the formal
announcement of the loss of "K.
of K."
Tlie flag on the war office was
at half mast, and 1' blinds of
the office were drawn.
Surprise was expressed that a
cruiser hearing the minister of
war could have been destroyed by
a torpedo or by a mine.
It Is probable that the question
whether the cruiser had an escort
and whether she was provided
with any protection against sub
marines will he put direct to the
government.
Many comments were heard in
the crowd about the war office.
Many remarked that it "was lucky
it didn't happen before conscript

They referred to the great
power of Kitchener ln his name,
which stimulated voluntary re
