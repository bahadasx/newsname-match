HIS STUFF LOST
LORD Kl ioHENER
ORGANIZED LARGEST VOLUNTEER
ARMY THE WORLD HAS EVER
KNOWN.
WAS BRITISH HERO
Kitchener, While Criticized on Many
Sides, Retained Popularity and the
Government and People Realized
His Efficiency.
London, June 6. Earl Kitchener,
the British war minister who lost
his life when the cruiser Hampshire
which was conveying him and his
staff struck a mine and sunk west of
Orkney Islands, was entitled to a
place in the world's history for many
things, but the most notable Is that
he organized (he largest volunteer
army the world has e-er seen during
the greatest war of all time.
Within a year from the sudden out
break of the European war In August,
1914, the ranks of British fighting
men were quadrupled by an increase
from less than one million to nearly
4,000,000.
All other great powers that enter
ed the war had huge standing armies
and compulsory military service.
Great Britain alone faced the Issue
with confidence that its people would
readily respond to the call of king
and country without compulsion, and
the precipitous developments that led
to the war found both the people
and the government unanimous In the
verdict that Kitchener of Khartum
was the man to lead in the recruit
ing and organization of the necessary
army.
It was not a sentimental clamor,
for though Kitchener was a proven
hero of many occasions, his person
ality wa3 as impenetrable as hard

NOTABLE FIGURE
Sec-n,roke out He had just come home
from service as British agent in Egypt
had accepted an earldom from King
George, and was being talked of
as viceroy to India. Within a few
hours after England's declaration of
war, Kitchener was appointed sec
retary of state for war and imme
diately took full charge at the war
office where he worked day and night
to overcome the handicap which the
central powers had over England in
the matter of fighting strength.
After dispatching a few hundred
thousand regulars to France and Bel
glum to help check the onrushing
Germans, the war secretary began
recruiting and organizing his army of
millions. The British lsies were cov-

ARDMORE, OKLAHOMA,
GETTING CONVENTION
QUESTION OF PURCHASING LOT
WHERE TABERNACLE STANDS
WILL BE PUT UP TO CITIZENS
THURSDAY.
The secretary of the Chamber of
Commerce has issued a call for a
mass meeting to be held at the taber
nacle Thursday night, at which time
the question' of purchasing the lot
by the Chamber of Commerce will
be considered.
The purpose of purchasing this
property is to erect a municipal au
ditorium in which large gatherings
can be had, and those who contribute
the money at this time will only re
tain title to the property until the
city is financially able to reimburse
them and take it over.
Mr. Jones, the owner of the prop
erty, has placed a price on it, and
it is confidently believed that the
money for its purchase can be raised
easily.
The meeting is called tor eight
o'clock and the secretary hopes that
every member of the Chamber of
Commerce will be present, as well as
any business man who is interested
in the future of Anlmore.

San Antonio, Texas, June 6. Al

TICKETS, CHICAGO
FUNDS MUST BE RAISED AND, A
GREAT DEAL OF WORK DONE
BEFORE THE OPENING DATE
BUSINESS MEN WILL HELP.
"The time is rapidly approaching
when the business men of the city
will be called upon to contribute to
ward erecting suitable buildings for
the county fair, "to be held here in
September.
Under the law the city In the coun
ty where the fair is held must erect
permanent buildings, and the time
Is not too long to get the necessary
funds raised and the buildings fin
ished in time for the opening date."
The above was a statement of one
of the officials of the county fair as
sociation this morning and is but a
forerunner of what the business men
will hear until the fund is raised.
The Chamber of Commerce has
held two carnivals this season and
has made several hundred dollars by
this method that is now on deposit in
the bank, but the secretary states
that it is not nearly enough, and
the balance will have to be raised
by popular subscript ion.
The track at the fair ground has
been maintained in good condition by
a few local hcrse fanciers, but the
grandstand and Btables must be built
before racing can be indulged in.
The Chamber of Commerce and
Business Men's association will have
charge of raising this fund, which,
as stated above, must be done quick
ly in order to have a creditable fair
this fall.

NUMBER 203.
Chicago, 111., June 6. The
political leaders are today
looking for any man to reunite
the republican party and are
trying to determine whether
Hughes has been strengthened
or weakened by the temporary
concentration of all forces on
him with the purpose of elimi
nating Roosevelt.
The conference between re
publican and progressive lead
ers continued last night and
were resumed again this .morn
ing but without any announced
result.
The republican leaders are
now watching to see what the
progressives will do when the
convention opens tomorrow,
when they expect a tremen
dous Roosevelt demonstration.
The two elements to be
brought into consideration to
day were, Jusjice Hughes'
speech in Washington "yester
day, touching on Americanism,
and the discussion of senator
Lodge of Massachusetts as a
compromise candidate for the
republican nomination, who is
likely to command Roosevelt's
support.
Hughes' supporters pointed
to his speech as a substantial
declaration of the question of
Americanism and contended
that it cleared up the only is
sue on which he had not pre
viously announced his attitude.
Others said it was a speech
such as any scholarly man
might make on such an occa
sion. Teddy Favors Leonard 'Wood
Oyster Hay, June 6. Roosevelt told
visitors today that he favored the
nomination of General Leonard Wood
as a solution of the Chicago situation,
that he would work for him as he was
a candidate who Is "thoroughly United
States."

not being available the matter was
deferred until the next regular meet
