DETERMINED ON
T. R. ISREPORT
VICTOR MURDOCK SAYS THAT
PROGRESSIVES WILLNAME ROOSEVELT
FRIDAY HUGHES MEN VERY ACTIVE
Chicago, BL, June 6.Determined upon a program of Roosevelt or
nothing, the radical Bull Moose today squarely challenged the conser-
vatira Prngiywriwn to do their worst. Victor Murdock heads the delegates
from 18 southern and western states with a program to nominate Roose-
velt Friday or to run a third party if the Republicans refuse to accept
him.
Murdock today said: "You can quote me as saying that we will
nominate Roosevelt."
~iA
Favors Wood.
New York, June 6.Two Roose
velt visitors returned from Oyster
Bay today and reported that Colonel
Roosevelt will support General Leon
ard Wood for president if the latter's
name comes seriously before the con
vention
Patriotic Talk.
Chicago, June 6.What Hughes
said last night at the graduation ex
ercises in Washington overshadowed
all interest here today. His volun
teer workers said that is the plainest
definition where Hughes stands Pro
gressives consider the talk incapable
of application. Favorite sons state
that it is merely patriotic talk.
Hughes Gives Address.
Washington, June 6 In the se
clusion of the National Cathedral
school lawn, where he was presenting
an American flag to the honor gradu
ates, Justice Charles E Hughes yes
terday made his first public address
since the opening of the pre-conven
tion campaign. He told the young
women graduates that the flag meant
America first, an undivided allegiance
and a nation united and equal to its
task.
"This flag means more than asso
ciation and reward," said the justice.
"It is the symbol of our national
unity, our national endeavor, of our
national aspiration. It tells you of
the struggle for independence, of
union preserved for liberty and union,
one and inseparable, of the sacrifices
of brave men and women, to whom
the ideals and honor of this nation
have been dearer than life
Open Door Plank.
Chicago, June 6.Tomorrow the
doors of the big Republican conven
tion will be opened. Today much
talk cenerted on the planks of the
platform.
There is a possibility that Japan's
demand upon China, declared to be
endangering the open-door and Amer
ican prestige in the Orient, will be
given a plank in the platform.
Delegates Present.
Delegates to the Republican na
tional convention poured into Chi
cago all day and it is believed that
practically all delegates are here.
Many delegations came quietly and
sought their hotels without display,
but the few that brought bands and
banners, and wore badges of favorite
sons, gave a touch of color and some
thing of a holiday air to preconven
tion day.
MINNESOTA INDIANS
WIN $711,000 SUIT
AGAINST THE U. S.
St Paul, Minn June 6 The sumi
of $711,000 will be distributed anion
Minnesota Indians as the result of at
decision given yesterday in the Unit
ed States court of claims at Wash
ington, according to reports leoeiveclj
in St Paul
The case has been pending for|
seven years, based on alleged viola
tion by the government of the Nel-t
son act, passed in 1889
The act provided for the pooling
of all reservational lands in the state,
with removal of the Indians thereon
to the White Earth reservation, the
Red Lake band being the only excep
tion The lands thus relinquished,
coming under the head of agricul
tural and pine lands, were to be heldi
in trust by the federal government,'
revenue from them to go into thei
United States treasury, with the in
terest reverting to the Indians. Thej
act further provided that after a
period of 50 years the money was
to be divided, pro rata, among the
surviving Indians. I
Claiming that in the case of the'
Mille Lacs band of Chippewas, the
government had not kept faith with
the Indians, but had made unauthor
ized disposal of the reservation under
the public lands law, Senator M. E.
Clapp, then chairman of the commit
tee on Indian affairs, obtained a juris
dictional act, by means of which the
Indians were enabled to sue the gov
ernment.
Last December a judgment was en
tered against the government in favor
of the Indians. The government
moved a new trial, and this motion
was denied yesterday.

The letter of W Gemmell, gen
eral manager ol the Minnesota & In
ternational railway, in which he out
lined the new plan for the highway,
is as follows:
40-Foot Road.
"To the Honorable City Council,
Bemidji, Minn
"Gentlemen: Confirming the verb
al understanding had with your spe
cial committee, with which I had a
meeting this afternoon on road mat
ter, I beg to say:
"1 If your decision is to retain
tne crossing at about its present lo
cation, we will arrange for a crossing
on our property up to 40 feet in
width, changing several of our
tracks so that there will be only one
railroad track located on the cross
ing
"In order to enable you to get a
road in of that width, it will be
necessitate your using -ar~sm?li por
tion of our property on the far side
of the river now leased to the Crook
ston Lumber Co. for lumber yard pur
poses, but not at present actually
used by them. We will endeavor to
secure the release of the strip of land
required and give the city an ease
ment for same, for roadway pur
poses
Cut Off Elevator.
"2. If roadway and crossing is
constructed full 40 feet in width, it
will require the cutting off of a por
tion of the Beltrami Elevator Co.'s
building and other changes in their
layout We will adjust with that
company direct such changes in a
manner that will be satisfactory to
them.
"3. Following your committee's
suggestion we will ask Armour & Co.
to load and unload their cars from
the railroad yard side of their build
ing so that their car will not stand
where it now does, causing an ob
struction to the view, in approach
ing the crossing. We further agree
that when another location can be
found for the Armour people, we will
arrange for the removal of their
building, and will not permit the con
struction of any other building on
that location, as we agree with your
committee's opinion that a building
there is a serious obstruction of the
view of the crossing. In dealing with
Armour & Co. in this matter we
must, of course, treat them in a fair
and equitable manner.
Will Give Material.
"We understand the material re
quired to fill the approaches to your
proposed new bridge on or near the
present location will amount to three
or four thousand cubic yards. We
agree to haul the necessary sand in
for this purpose and plow it off in
the vicinity of the work free of
charge to the city, at the time we
haul in material we will need to

LORD KITCHENER
LOST WHEN SHIP
IS SUNK BY MINE
BRITISH MINISTER OF WAR ON LINER
HAMPSHIRE NORTH OF SCOTLAND FOR
CONFERENCE ENROUTE TO RUSSIA
London, June 6.(Official.)Lord Kitchener, British minister of
war, with his entire staff was lost when the cruiser Hampshire was sunk
off the Orkney Islands, north of Scotland.
Searching parties sent for Kitchener report that they found only
bodies of drowned men. There is the faintest hope that some of the men
may have been saved.
The Hampshire was enroute to Russia where Kitchener was to hold
conferences.
London, June 6.There is public consteration and amazement as a
result of Kitchener's death.
The main base of the British fleet, supposedly, is off the islands
north of Scotland. Hence it considered likely that Kitchener and his
staff went there for a conference with high officials and an inspection of
the fleet following the Jutland fight of last Wednesday.
The Hampshire was a British battle cruiser of the Argyle type and
had 655 officers and men.
The Hampshire's participation in Wednesday's naval battle was not
mentioned.

*0ilTY CENTS PES MONTH
County Kerry, Ireland, June 24, 1850,
a son of Lieut Col Kitchener of the
English army
Is Promoted.
In 1884 he served on the staff of
the British expeditionary force on the
Nile, which vainly attempted to res
cue Gen Gordon at Khartoum, and
was promoted successively major and
lieutenant colonel by brevet for his
services In 1885 he was commis
sioner in the delimination of anzi
bar and returning to Egypt in the
following year he was made com
mandant at Suakin, which post he
held until 1888 In the following
year he was given the Cross of the
Bath for his part in the action at
Toski under General Grenfell. For
four years he was adjutant general,
and in 1892 he succeeded Sir Fran
cis, afterwards Lord, Grenfell as sir
dar of the Egyptian army, and com
pleted his task of reorganizing the
forces of the Khedive.
Made Major General.
Advanced to the rank of major
general, he completed the defeat of
the dervishes at the battle of Om
durman and captured Khartoum.
After the victory of Omdurman in
1898 Kitchener was raised to the
peerage as Baron Kitchener of Khar
toum, and received the thanks of par
lament and a grant of $160,000.
Early in 1899 he was appointed gov
ernor-general of the Sudan.
In Boer War.
In the autumn of that year the
Boer war broke out, and after the
"Black Week," with its disastrous
defeat of the British troops under
General Buller, Lord Roberts was ap
pointed commander-in-chief in South
Africa, with Lord Kitchener as chief
of staff. When in December, 1900,
Lord Roberts returned to England,
Kitchener succeeded to the position
of commander-in-chief. In the nego
tiations culminating in the peace of
Vereeniging he again gave proof of
his diplomatic ability. He was ad
vanced to the dignity of viscount, pro
moted to the substantive rank of gen
eral "for distinguished service," and
received the thanks of parliament and
a grant of $250,000.
Field Marshal.
In 1902 he was appointed com
mander-in-chief of India and during
the seven years in that capacity he
proved himself thoroughly efficient
in reforming and reorganizing the
British and native forces. In 1909
he was promoted field marshal and
succeeded the Duke of Connaught as
commander-in-chief and high com
missioner in the Mediterranean. Lord
Kitchener was unmarried and had
the reputation of being a confirmed
woman-hater. He was a rather
stern, hard-working man and a strict
disciplinarian, standing high in the
esteem but not in the love of his sol
diers.
