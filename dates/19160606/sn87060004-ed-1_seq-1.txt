WILLIAM G. JENKINS
. OF ST. CHARLES
Is Called to His Eternal
Home. Was Much Loved
and Respected Citizen
The death of Williem O. Jenkins
a well known and much respected
citizen of St. Charles cast" a deep
goom over this little city last Sunday.
Mr. Jenkins had been ill from stom
ach trouble for a number of months
and the end came atjone o'clock Sun
day afternoon. Mr. Jenkins was
born in Pennsylvania 73 years ago,
he came to St. Charles in 1874. He
worked for the St. Bernard Mining
Company ever since, and. during his
42 years of service has held positions
of trust.
Mr. Jenkins was one of the best
known and beloved men in the com
munity. He was an active Mason
and Odd Fellow and a leader in all
fraternal works. He bore a marked
and striking resemblance to Mark
Twain, the famous author. He was
married in the year 1888 to Miss
Annie King, sister of the late George
King, and in addition to his widow,
he leaves five children, Mrs. Clay
Woodrnff of St. Charles; Mrs. W.
J. Dribble, of Detroit, Mich.;
George Charley and Miss Jettie Jen
kins, of St. Charles; one sister in
Pennsylvania, also a nephew, O. B.
Jenkins, formerly, of Providence.
While Mr. Jenkins never amassed
wealth, yet he left to those behind a
greater legacy, in so much that he
was one of the best citizens, a kind
and devoted husband and father.
He was a consistent member of
the Christian church, from which
church the funeral services were held
Monday at 2 p. m., conducted by
Rev. S. E. Harlan, of Hartford, Ky.
The Masons and Odd Fellows had
eharge of the burial service.
Quite a number of Earlington
citizens attended the burial services

useful and exemplary citizen.
Resolved, That we bow in humble
submission to the Supreme Will of
Him, Who is too wise to err and too
good to wantonly afflict, recognizing
that we too will soon be cnt down
by the grim Reaper and gathered
into the unknown land of shadows
from whose bourne no traveler has
ever yet jeturned. ,
Resolved, that we extend our
heartfelt sympathy to the stricken
family and sorrowing friends in this
sad hour of affliction and bereave,
ment and for soYace and comfort
can only point them to Him who has
promised to be a husband to the
widow and a father to the fatherless
who notes the sparrows fall and
heeds the young raven's cry.

draped in mourning and the brethren
wear the customary badge of sorrow
for the next thirty days.
