IT RESTS WITH HIM TO SAY
Chicago, June 6. Political leaders
are trying to determine whether
Hughes is strengthened or weakened
by the temporary concentration of
forces upon him with the avowed
purpose of eliminating Roosevelt. The
effect of the drive ' is to place the
'field against Hughes.
Republican and Progressive leaders
. , resumed conference this morning.
George W. Perkins in a statement de
clared that Roosevelt hadn't said he
wouldn't support Hughes or any other
man. Latest elements considered were
Hughes' speech in Washington yes
terday and the discussion of Lodge as
a compromise candidate.
Hughes' supporters claim his speech
on Americanism cleared the only
question he hadn't previously declared
himself on.. Opponents called it a
"List of Platitudes", many saying it
was carefully timed."' Practical poli
ticians are almost unanimous in hold
ing that the speech was without sig
nificance., ... ,
What the, progressives will do . to
' morrow has overshadowed the Repub
lican maneuvering. A tremendous
Roosevelt demonstration is expected
despite the efforts to delay the nomi
, nation. The leaders decided last night
that Roosevelt should be nominated
soon a possible. Nothing but a re
quest from the colonel will be allow
ed to interfere.
Progressive headquarters at the
Congress Hotel opened today.

Asking Nothing More Than
Treatment in Their Ap
for an Eight Hour Day .
'. (Special to the Star).
Cleveland, Ohio, June 6. A state
ment issued today by the railroad
transportation brotherhoods shows
that freight train employes have one
of the most hazardous of all occupa
tions. . ,
Railroad-officials lay much stress on
the statement, that "18 per cent of all
railroad employes now receive 28 per
cent of the total wages paid."
This claim means nothing what
ever, because it fails to take into con
sideration the years of preparation
for the job and the fact that the line
between life and death is so thin, that
when a train employe leaves on his
run, he is never sure when he will re
turn..- ' :.
The last annual report of the Inter
state Commerce Commission shows
that a train man is killed on an aver
age of every four hours and forty
minutes, and a man v crippled every
hree minutes and 30 seconds. And
his does not tell all the" story, be
cause if a man does not die from his
injuries within 24 hours, he is not re
ported to the commission as killed
and unless the injury disables him for
three days he is not counted ,-as in
jured. "
Out of every 100 men who start
work as firemen, only 17 ever become
engineers, out of. every 100 men who
do become enginers, only six become
passenger engineers. The average
length of service is eleven and a half
years. Train service employes are
picked men in every .sense of the
word. Few realize the rigid physical
examination they are required to pass
and which is more severe than the
United States government requires
for enlistment in the army and navy.
Physical examinations are repeated
every two or three years. Eyesight,
hearing, color perception, heart ac
tion and blood pressure are all scru
tinized closely. ,,
Although the U. S. government
prohibits by law the , continuous em
ployment of a train employe more
than 16 hours, it is worthy of note
that in 1915 there were 78,940 viola
tions reported by the railroads them
selves. v Under the rates of pay now receiv
ed by the men, they must work from
12 to 20 hours in order to earn
enough to be on a par with the wage
earners in other trades.
What man receives per hour is the
only! proper basis for discussing
wages. The following scale shows
the prevailing wages received per
hour by freight crews as compared to
other trades.
Locomotive engineers, 48 c.
Bricklayers, plasterers, etc., 75c.
Locomotive firemen, 31c.
Carpenters, painters, etc., 70c.
Freight conductors, 49c.
Laborers in tunnels, wells, etc., 57c.
Freight brakemen, 26.7c.
Excavating laborers, 40c. -
Are these high wages when you
consider the responsibility and skill
required of freight train men?
Excessive hours and the terrific
strain shatter the health and shorten
the lives of these men.
The employes are not asking for
more. pay, only that their working
hours be made less.
They desire relief from the present
arduous working conditions so that
their time at home will be lengthened
and their chance of relaxation im
proved. . . '

HOT SPRINGS SUFFERED HEAV
ILY Hot Springs, Ark., June 6. Four
persons were killed, several were ser

and cut by broken' glass and flying
timbers in a tornado which swept
across Garland county and cut a path
through the southwestern, portion of
Hot Springs late yesterday.
The electric light and $ power plant
which supplies Hot Springs with
lighting and power for the street car
system, was incapacitated and the
city is temporarily without traffic ser
vice or lights. '
The tornado struck Hot Springs
first in the vicinity of Oak Lawn race
track. There a Methodist church was
blown down. Then the wind crushed
out a few frame buildings across from
the Oak Lawn entrance and left an
imprint of broken windows and torn
roofs on the racetrack grandstand and
buildings. From there several small
houses were lifted and crumpled until
the wind reached Majestic, park and
spring training grounds of the Bos
ton Americans. That was swept clean.
Then .the electric light and power
plant was damaged considerably and
from that point the wind swept a path
through to the northeast, where many
dwelling houses were damaged.

Indications are that the Vote Will be
Heavy and Counting the Ballots
a Long and Tedious Job
for the Inspectors
The most interesting event today is
the primary election, which is keeping
the courthouse1 and vicinity thronged
with the candidates and their friends.
Voting has been going on steadily
all day. At 2 o'clock 423 votes had
been polled in precinct No. 1, includ
ing Ocala and surrounding , territory,
out of a total of 632 qualified voters.
-Candidates are hunting the streets,
the grass and the tall timber, and the
chances are that no voter will escape
unless he is as the point of death.
Some of the candidates will be looking
for the tall .timber themselves this
time tomorrow. r
The ballot is a long one, and be
tween counting and estimates the in
spectors and clerks wijl have a long
and tedious job before them. They are
certain to be at work all night, and
perhaps a good part of tomorrow.
The inspectors will count the offices
voted for on the tickets in their order.
The, first .will be the county commis
sioners for this district. Senatorial
and gubernatorial , candidates will
come next. It is likely that the vote
of the entire county will be known
before that of Ocala. It is not likely
that enough will come in from the
rest of the state to establish any
definite re'sults tonight.
CLOSED THE CAMPAIGN
The political speech-making in this
county ended last night when the
various candidates for . county offices
spoke from the bandstand on the
courthouse square. A large crowd was
out to hear the candidates, and there
was much applause and cheering.
Some of the candidates waxed hot in
their talks in attacking their oppon
ents. There was some plain speak
ing. W. T. Gary, -chairman of the
county executive committee, presided.
The speaking began at JF:30 o'clock
and continued until after midnight.
HALF HOLIDAYS
Frank's Store will close for the

this week. The H. B. Masters Co.
and Rheinauer & Co. will close from
Thursday week on.
IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENTS
One of the first things to be done
by The Florida Utilities company,
which has just purchased the Ocala

London, June 6. Admiral Jellico
reports that the cruiser Hampshire,
with Earl Kitchener, minister of war,
and his staff on board, was sunk by a
torpedo or mine off the West Orkney
islands. Little hope is entertained
that there are any survivors. Four
boats were seen from shore to leave
the Hampshire, but a heavy sea was
-running at the time and the boats
capsized. Many bodies have been
washed ashore and found at sea.
Kitchener and his staff were on the
way to Russia. " j

Earl Kitchener and his staff were

HOTEL DOR I!!
BEUOOiLER'S IIS
One of Jacksonville's Finest Hotels to
be Made Bigger and Better
than Ever,
- (Times-Union)
A force of workmen are busily en
gaged on the first preliminary work
of remodeling the Windsor hotel into
one of the most palatial tourist resorts
in the state, according-to announce
ment made yesterday by Manager J.
E. Kavanaugh. While " the. present
work is confined mostly to smaller
details on the inside, the carpenters
and laborers will shortly begin re
modeling of the front of the building,
when the public will be able to
actually see the changes taking place.
Although the Windsor hotel, it is
said, now has the largest number of
rooms of any other Jacksonville hotel,
completion of the contract awarded a
short time ago by Robert R. Meyer,
the owner, will add more sleeping
rooms to the establishment besides a
number of novel features to contribute
to the comfort and pleasure of the
winter tourists and the commercial
men and 'other travelers during the
summer months.
Mr. Kavanaugh stated last night
that every detail of changes and ad
ditions to be made has not been de
cided upon'by Mr. Meyer and himself.
However, he - said that the- former
large dining room along the East
Monroe street side of the hotel on the
first floor will be divided into sleep
ing rooms. It is also possible that
inside court rooms will be converted
into sleeping verandas, which will be
a novel feature and one not now
possessed by any other Jacksonville
hotel. ',-
The management plans to construct
a large airy dining room to replace
the old one. Completed plans will
probably show that this is to be lo
cated on the front of the building
above the spacious veranda, which
will permit the guests to enjoy break
fast during the winter on the eastern
side of the house, where they may
have full benefits of the morning sun.
Mr. Meyer expects to spend from
$75,000 to $100,000 completing the im
provements, and the hotel' will be
ready in its new dress by the time the
tourists begin coming to Florida in
the. late autumn. They will then find
one of the most attractive and pala
tial establishments of this kind in the
state. ' ' ; ' ' ; '

zone of the Voihyniah fortress tri
