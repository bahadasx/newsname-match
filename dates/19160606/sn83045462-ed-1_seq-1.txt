Robertson May Be Successor.
The first question asked uhen the
news "f Kitchener's death was announced
was: "Who will succeed him?''
The answer invariably was: "Robertson,
of course." j
Sir William Robertson, who is re- .
garded as 'he only possible successor
to Karl Kitchener as the head of the
c.- t.cw *i r r*i *- al reariv had taken over!
the war secretary's duties temporarily
when the secretary started on his illfated
journev. On Saturday, arid again
yesterday, he had audiences with King
George to report the activities on the
British front, in which the Canadians
have so distinguished themselves.
The general has the full confidence of
trie country. While only a member of
parliament may serve as secretary of
war. Cen. Robertson would be eligible
if raised to the peerage; or a member
of the house of commons might be appointed
wat secretary, with the understanding
that tin general, like Karl
Kitchener, would have a free rein.
War Council Meets.
When the news of the sinking of the
cruiser Hampshire with Karl Kitchener
and his staff on board was received In
London, a meeting of the British war
council was immediately called. Sir William
Robertson, chief of the imperial
staff, who probably will become the head
?.f the war office: Sir Kdward Grey, sectetarv
for foreign affairs; Reginald McKenna.
chancellor of the exchequer, and
Lav-id Lloyd George, minister of munitions.
were present at the council.
Business on the stock exchange was
suspended when the news of Karl Kitch- :
ener's death was received. The members j
stood idly about the floor, discussing the j
nation a loss.
Kitchener's Heavy Burden.
Premier Asquith paid high tribute to
Karl Kitchener's work in his speech at
the recent adjournment of parliament,
saying no other man could have raised
the great armies which KilChener assembled
It has been recognized that there was
placed on the war secretary's shoulders
a load which it was impossible for one
man to bear. In the early part of the
war he was responsible not only for the?
organization of armies, but for the enormous
work of equipping them ami sup- j
plying them with munitions. Since David
Lloyd tleorge tool; charge of the muni-j
t:ons department Karl Kitchener had j
been able to devote himself more largely to )
the work of military organization, tlreat
Britain's allies had great confidence in
Karl Kitchener's judgment. His visits to
France and Italy were supposed to have
had Important results In co-ordinating the
work of the allies. The fact that he had

indication that he was on a similar mission
to that country. The first lntima

Adviser to Lloyd George.
Sir Hay Frederick Donaldson, among
those who accompanied J,ord Kitchener
on the Hampshire, was technical adviser
to David Uoyd George, minister
of munitions. He was prominent in the
engineering world, being a past president
of the Institute of Mechanical Engineers
and . a member of various engineering
societies. He was born in
1*56.
Hugh James O'Rf-im* in

the present war he had gained fjie distinguished

Lieut. Col. Oswald Arthur Fitzgerald,
who had been personal military secre- 1

1914. had been closely associated with

He was Kitchener's assistant military

ago an officer on his staff during his
mission to Japan, Australia and New |
Zealand in 1909 and his military secretary

Believed to Have Struck Mine.
Naval officers express the opinion
that the cruiser Hampshire must have
struck a mine, as it would have to be
an exceedingly lucky shot for a torpedo
to get a ship with her speed and
under the conditions of the sea, which
was very rough.
The Hampshire, while an old boat
and not fit for fleet action, was fast
enough for patrol and blockade work,
yhe carried a crew of between 400 and
500 men.
The Hampshire had been in use as a
scout boat and for carrying officials on
various missions, having ample accommodations
for the latter purpose. When
the war started she was in the far east,
and was reported to have been worsted
in a fight with Germans in the couth
China sea. She was one o4 the British
squadron which was sent o 1he United

Agreement Reached at Conference
in Superintendent's Office.
The Washington terminal strike is over, j
The men of tlie car and electrical de- j
partments who walked out Memorial day !
will all go hack to work, the night men j
at the beginning of. that shift tonight and ;
the day men tomorrow morning. Both '
parties are apparently satisfied with the
basis on which matters were settled.
At 11 :10 o'clock this morning the strikers,
more than 300 strong, unanimously
ratified an agreement reached at a threecornered
conference held at the L'nion
station last night between A. M. Keppel,
superintendent of the terminal company,
the committee of five representing the employes
and William Blackmail, commissioner
of conciliation, representing the
Department of Labor.
The main point at issue?the elimination
of the alleged "graft system" under
which the men had been compelled
to work?is Settled to the satisfaction
of all concerned except the men whose
scalps the employes particularly wished
to see fall. Two of the foremen implicated
by an investigation undertaken
by company officials, which, they
say, would have been held in any event,
are now removed from the pay roll,
and It is expected that others will follow.
The inquiry is not ended, say the
officials, and will not end short of
complete and thorough investigation.
All Will Return to Work.
<
Every man who peacefully walked j
out a week ago today will return to l
work with the same status and under
the same conditions as before, with
certain exceptions, agreeable to both
parties, as regards a few steam-heat
men. The services of the men#laid off
shortly before the strike, numbering
about fifty, will be utilized as fast as
vacancies occur, they being given the
preference over other applicants.

creeps up, not like a spring frcsl
comes in at Barnegat.
Something approaching an organization
in the camp of Mr. Justice Hughes
ivas perfected late yesterday, when his
well-wishers from all stales rallied unier
the leadership of Gov. Whitman of
N'ew York, former Senator Fulton of
Dregon and Frank H. Hitchcock. Gov.
Whitman is the recognized standard
nearer of the movement in behalf of
VIr. Hughes, while Mr. Hitchcock atends
to such minor details as seing
;hat votes are rounded up. Gov. WhitAam
is doing the talking and the former
"fair-haired boy" of the Roosevelt
idministration "brings in the bacon." ;
Various interpretations were put j
jpon Mr. Hughes' remarks at the flag
presentation in Washington. George
iV. Perkins, Gov. Johnson of California
ind other radical bull moosers flouted
hem, of course, characterizing them
is inadequate as a declaration of polcy,
adding the sneering suggestion that
hey only constituted an acknowledgment
of his actual candidacy. In othe?
juarters, under non-partisan analysis,
hey were regarded as being of a general
nature and not likely to exert important
influence in his behalf in the
onvention.
Gains Claimed by All.
Today the managers of the allies and
lavorite sons all report gains in their
espective forces. They still are intent
jpon their primary and necessary object,
to wit, gathering a force which
vill prevent Mr. Hughes obtaining a
commanding lead on the first ballot.
Their next effort will be to hold that
>trength throughout the second ballot,
md, if they still have him "stopped," to
proceed to the real business of uniting
ipon one of their number.
The people who are back of the proposed
nomination of Mr. Hughes are
calmly confident that on the second
>allot they will make such inroads into
he columns of all the favorite sons
hat they will demonstrate the secondchoice
sentiment in favor of their canlidate
and put the allies to rout.
Attitude of Bull Moosers.
The attitude of the bull moosers at
his moment is exemplified by a remark
nade by George W. Perkins when he
vas asked if it would be possible to

It was evident today that the progressives
were divided. They seem t?>
be split into three groups. The radical
group, led by William Allen White and
Victor Murdock of Kansas and Gov.
Johnson of California, want to go ahead
and nominate Roosevelt without waiting
for the republicans. The moderately
conservatives, led by George W.
Perkins, want to proceed with care and
caution, in the hope that a permanent
union between the republican and profrressivA

the exercise of patience. The third
I group, led by Horace Wilkinson * of
New York, advocate making the best
i possible bargain with the republicans
and joining with them in nominating a
; ticket and adopting a platform of as
progressive a stamp as can he brought
about under that kind of reunion.
Seeks to Delay Action.
Mr. Perkins' line of strategy is to
withhold action by the progressive convention,
thereby holding a club over
the heads of the regulars aird keeping
the big glasses and shining teeth constantly
as a bugaboo in the background.
He himself is not certain now whether
he can keep the "Onward. Chr'stian
Soldiers," contingent from taking up
the line of march at the outset.
A very interesting situation exists in
the Massachusetts delegation, having
important bearing upon the candidacy
of Senator Weeks for the presidential
nomination.
It develops that after the first ballot
the delegation will divide. Roosevelt
will be given four or more votes. Gov.
MoCall will get from four to six votes,
Mr. Hughes a number of votes, and such
men as Senator Lodge and former Senator
Crane will switch from Weeks to
other candidates. Crane is for Hughes.
Lodge is undecided between Roosevelt
and Hughes. Senator Lodge defines his
position as follows: He says the Massachusetts
delegation was elected 011 a
written agreement that the delegates
should go uninstructed. He will place
Senator Weeks In nomination and vote
for him on the first ballot, but he contends
that no one has a right to seek
to control his vote on succeeding bal
lots. He hotly resents the suggestion
that he is in any way debarred from
voting for Roosevelt. He will not decide
between Hughes and Roosevelt
until the time comes.
