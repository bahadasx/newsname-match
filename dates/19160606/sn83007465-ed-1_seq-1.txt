night mooting followed ono held during

Miss Maude Younger of Californi;
the temporary ehalrman. made th
keynote spoeeh. Slie said that th
Woman's party would consoler n
otlier issue than equal suffrage a

influence to that party which sup ^

laid blame for the defeat of the n >

"If as great a percentage of Democrats
as of Republicans had voted fo'

Chicago, Juii" Representatives
of the several candidates for the Republican

in a perplexing predicament tonight.
Having fostered sentiment in f.ivor

Colonel Roosevelt was definitely olim

During the day it grew to the proportions
of a boom. KfTort Is being ,

against it, and the indications arc
that the veto of the Progressive!
party, which, of course, m< ins Cnl-j

Hughes, may be sought as a check. (
Harmony Above Kv? rylhing.
Harmony above everything else is'
