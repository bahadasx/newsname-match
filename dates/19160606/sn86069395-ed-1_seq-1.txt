A part of the British fleet was caught

EVERYBODY 18 STILL IN DOUBT
"What Will the Old Guard
Do?" Question Hard to
Solve.
Chicago, June 5. For some un
known reason, for which no explana
tion is offered, there is a growing
conviction here among both republi
can and progressive leaders assembled
for the national convention that
Col. Roosevelt will not be nominated
by the older party. Among those
who hold this in view are many num
bered among the colonel's closest
friends, who nonetheless are not giv
ing up the fight.
The leaders who take this view of
the situation seem to think that Jus
tice Hughes is the man wjio could
bring the republican and progressive
parties together and present a solid
front to the democratic opposition,
even though they arc not convinced
that the justice can win tho nomina
tion. The situation which this condition
presents (s unprecedented. None of
the leaders on tHefifround profess to
have any idea of what will happen.
It seems certain that Col. Roosevelt
could have -the progressive' nomina
tion at once if he-would say the word
and still leave the way open to with'
draw his candidacy if the republican
convention nominated- a man whom
he was willing to support.
WHAT WILL OLD GUARD DO?
On every hand today there is spec
ulation as to what the Old Guard will
do if it succeeds in defeating Col.
Roosovelt for the nomination; wheth
er they would go the whole distance
and nominate a man of their .number,
such as Root, Fairbanks, Weeks or
Burton, or whether they would . at
tempt to conciliate the progressives
by choosing a man whom the latter
might support. The name of Justice
Hughes is the only one that has been
brought forward so far as having
such possibilities.
Among the rank and file of the re
publicans there arc indications that a
genuine effort to draw the progres
sives back into the old party will be
made.
The Kentucky delegation arrived
today. The "big eight" are Edwin
P. Morrow, Somerset, who ran such
a strong race against Governor Stan
fey last November; E. C. O'Rear,
Frankfort; William Marshall Bullitt
and A. E. Willson, Louisville; Con
gressman John W. Langley, Pikeville;
Congressman Caleb Power, Barbour
ville, and Phil Brown, a negro editor,
from Hopkinsville.
Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., arrived in
Chicago today with William Loeb,
Jr., and mingled with tho pre-con-vontion.crowd
in hotel lobbies. Ho
will attend tho convention as a.guest
of J. Ogden Armour.
"I do not know what the conven
tion is going to do," said Roosovelt to
friends tonight, "but the sentiment of
the country wherever polls have been
taken seems to be' for father."
MRS. CATT COMES BACK.
Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, presi
dent of tho National American Wo
man Suffrage association, is horo and
will preside today at tho opening con
ference of that organization which
will continue for two days. The
purpose of this conference is to form

GIRL FACES TRIAL
MURDER CHARGE
Accused of Slaying Rival For
Man's Affections, Ella
Monroe in jail.
EVA GREGORY THE VICTIM
Much Contradictory Evidence
to Come Before June Har
din Circuit Court.
Elizabcthtown, Ky., June 5. Miss
Ella Monroe, 21 years old, is In jail
here awaiting trial on the charge of
murdering her rival, Miss Eva Greg
ory, who was slain on March 21 while
returning to her home on horseback.
Love letters from Clarence Quiggins,
now living in Illinois, the former suit
or of Miss Monroe and more lately
enamored of the slain girl, will play
an important part in trial at this term
of Circuit Court.
The evidence against Miss Monroe
is circumstantial. No one saw the
person who ambushed her rival and
fired the fatal shot. But the State's
Attorney has established the fact that
both girls were in love with the same
man; that the gun with which the
Monroe home both before and after
the shooting; that the girls had not
spoken to each other when they met
in a store just before tje shooting;
that the tracks of a woman's shoes
were found at the scene of the
tragedy, and that they led toward the
Monroe home.
CONFLICT OF EVIDENCE.
There is much conflict of evidence
as to the movements of the accused
girl on the afternoon of the shooting.
In her alibi Miss Monroe will attempt
to prove that she was not at the scene
of the shooting and could not have
arrived there in time.
The Monroes and the Gregorys are
neighbors, and had been friends.
Jhe two girls went to the school and
to church together. This continued
until some one told Ella Monroe that
Clarence Quiggins had taken her
friend home from church on Sunday.
Quiggins and Miss Monroe had long
been sweethearts. There was a
quarrel, but they made up and be
came engaged-. Later reports that
her sweetheart was paying attention
to Miss Gregory aroused further
jealousy, it is said in the neighbor
hood. The girls became estranged
and had not spoken to each other fo'r
some time.
Quiggins moved t6 Illinois, promis
ing to marry Miss Monroe at Christ
mas time. When he returned she
charged him with being fond of her
rival. There was a quarrel and Quig
gins went away.
On Tuesday, March 21, Ella Mon
roe was in the post-office reading a
letter from Quiggins when Miss Greg
ory entered. The girls did not speak,
Ella Monroe left first, and she was
accompanied half-way homo by an
other girl. When Miss Gregory left
the store it was about 3 o'clock. At
3:30 she was shot and killed near her
home, and the riderless horse gallop
ing down the road attracted attention
to her misfortune.
Miss Gregory had heon shot over
the heart and her waist caught fire.
The gun wadding was from a 28-
gaugo shotgun, and the only weapon
of this kind in the neighborhood had
been loaned to a hired man on the
Monroo farm.
In the soft earth by the roadside
were the marks of a woman's shoes.
These have been preserved. A place
was found where the wearer had re
moved the shoes and walked for some
distance in her stocking feet. A pair
of shoes fitting the tracks exactly
were found hidden m the Monroe
home.
Insulted Old Glory.
Bouck White, pastor of tho Church
of Social Revolution, New York, who
participated in burning of American
flag and other national emblems near
his church, was found guilty of dese
crating tho American emblem, fined
$1,000 and sentenced to thirty days in
the penitentiary,
THE ENGLISH
CLAIM A BIG
GERMAN LOSS
Admiralty Asserts that Eigh
teen Ships in AH Were
Destroyed in Battle.
GREATER TIN THE BRITISH
Official List of Casualties Show
That Few Officers Escaped
From Doomed Ships.
London, June 5. The British ad-
mirality last night issued a statement
saying there was the strongest grounds
for the belief that the British navy in
the battle with the Germans off Jut
land last week had accounted for a to
tal of eighteen German men of war,
and that there was nothing to add to
or subtract from the original announce
ment of the British losses.
The statement gave the German loss
es as two battleships, two dread
nought battle cruisers, four light
cruisers, and nine torpedo boat de
stroyers and a submarine.
The pessimism which prevailed as a
result of the admiralty's original state
ment of losses, which now is consid
ered to have been needlessly candid
and conservative in under-estimatintr
!Ra, extent of the German losses as
compared with those of Greai Britain,
has been greatly lessened by the lat
est statement.
WESTFALEN AND LUTZOVV SUNK
A dispatch from Coppenhagen says
rumors are current in Hamburg that
two additional German warships than
those announced in the German com
muliication the battleship Westfalen
and the battle cruiser Lutzow were
sunk in the battle. A wireless dis
patch received here Saturday from
Berlin said the German admiralty ad
mitted the loss of the Westfalen.
The admiralty statement declares
that the German losses in the fight
were not only relatively, but abso
lutely greater than those of . the Brit
ish. Maintaining its practice of cau
tion, the admirallty still rofrains from
giving the names of the lost German
ships.
The official list of the casualties
among officers shows that hardly a
single officer of the line escaped from
the British cruisers sunk in the battle,
An additional casualty list of petty of
ficers show that forty-three of them
were saved from the Queen Mary,
Invincible, Fortune, Ardent and
Shark. None were saved from tho
Indefatigable, Defense, Black Prince,
Tipperary, Turbulent, Nomad or Nes
tor.
The list gives the names of sixty-
five men killed aboard tho Warrior
and of twenty-seven men wounded.
On the other ships engaged in the
fight, 115 men were killed and 85
wounded.
BERESFORD IN INTERVIEW.
Admiral Lord Boresford in an in
terview today while strongly contend
ing for the view that there vas no
failure in the British strategy and that
Vice-Admiral Beatty won' a brillu.nt
success, though it was dearly bought,
declares that tho only mislalte nu&u
by the admiralty was in allowing the
Germans to get first in the field with
tho news of the battle, or as he puts
it, with "impudent fabrications."
Otherwise, said Lord Bcresford, "no
fault can bo found with tho admiral
ty." . KAISER PRAISES FLEET.
