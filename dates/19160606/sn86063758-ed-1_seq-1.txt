JOHN HE
The commencement season of Newberry
college with all of its conflicting
emotions of joy and sorrow, has
once- more arrived.
The happiness that comes to those
? whose work has been well done, is
being diffused among the many commencement
visitors, while the sorrow
of the parting hour for those who
will embark upon the troubled sea
of life, is rapidly approaching,
f Examination week, preceding commencement
is always looked upon
/ by the diligent student as a happy
climax to all his labors while tha
careless and indifferent student sees
nothing in it but a crisis which he
i firmly believes fate has decreed that
lie must pass through with whatever
fortune or misfortune slie may see fit
to bestow upon him. With him it is
a game of chance?a gan.ole, and up(r
on this principle and .along this line
of thought and action iris life will
likely be spent. Fortunately for Xew|!
berry college there are few if any of
I this type of students among the
r v classes .this session as the class room
record on recitation and the rigid
J term examination usually weed them
out before the final or commencement
rM examinations are held.
The commencement exercises began
Saturday night at the college
auditorium with a contest in declamation.
This is a sophomore class feature
in which eight members engaged.
The medal awarded each year is
/i given by the Excelsior and Phrenatf
kosimian literary societies and was
'.von this year by Mr. H. M. Boozer
with Mr. A. R. Boring as a close second.
Mr. Boozer's subject was "Old
Soapy," and Mr. Boring's subject was j
"Engineer Connor's <Son."
On Sunday morning at the opera
house the baccalaureate sermon ~ was
r preached to the graduating ciass oyj
the president of' the college, Dr. J. |
Henry Harms.
The exercises opened at 11 o'clock
with the anthem sung by the choir,
| "I Will Lift Mine Eyes,"- followed by
[ scripttfre reading by Rev. Edward

prayer was offered by Rev. J. W. Carson.
Followfng the song, "I Love
Thy Zion Lord," Rev. Felenwider announced
that Dr. Harms would
preach the sermon.
Dr. Harms took as his subject
"Christian CUivalry," based on the

chapter and 1st verse. He discussed
his subject ably and interestingly as
he does any subject that he is called
upoit to discuss. Under the three
sub-divisions, chivalry of conscience,
chivalry of service and the chivalry

its weaknesses and adminished his
youthful hearers to live for service
as the highest calling among men.
Dr. Harms paid a strong tribute to
the power and influence of woman in
the home at the close of his address.
TmmpHiatplv after Dr. Harms' ser
mon, an offering was taken for the
benefit of the college.
On Sunday night the address to the
Young IMen's Christian association
was made by Rev. P. E. Monroe of
Summerland college.
At 8:30 the choir sang an anthem,
"Sauctus" after -which there was responsive
reading led by Dr. Harms
and a scripture lesson. Prayer was
offered by Dr. A. J. Bowers. After
the singing of the hymn "Abide With
Me," Rev. Monroe made his address.
He based his address on the words
of Elisha to his doubting young man
servant, "Fear not, for they that bo
with us, are more than they who be
with them." The speaker referred
to the power and influence of the Y.
M. C. IA. as an organization for fighting
the unseen enemy and urged preparation
by building up Christian character.
This is the kind of preparedness
most needed by the national government?Spiritual
and moral preparedness.
The doers of evil and the doers
of good are always under 'he ob
servation of the spirit world and
while evil seems at times to prevail,
yet God's unseen hosts are ever present
and powerful to overcome. That
no temptation was e>er so powerful

unseen helpers.
Rev. Monroe is a graceful speaker
and his message was clear cut and to
the point.
Following the address of Rev. Monroe
an offering was taken to help defray
the expenses of the Y. M. C. A.
After singing of the anthem, "Now
the Day is Over," and the hymn, "Onward
Christian soldier,'' the benediction
was pronounced by Rev. 'Monroe.
On Monday, morning from 10:30 to
11:30 tbe senior class held class day
exercises under the spreading shade
trees on the college campus. James
r Kinard the president of the class
acted as chairman. After the sing
mi, of llie s?ng ".Fair Aewnerry .miss
Estelle Caldwell delivered the class
prophecy. IMiss Caldwell is an excel.ent
elocutionist and her paper was
full of life and humor and was punctuated
by frequent applause. "Character
Sketches'' by G. I). Oxner and
C. D. Hipp was well received.
"Idiosyncrasies" by G. B. Derrick was
a friendly grilling in which every
member of the faculty came in for a !
skinning. "A little nonsense now;
l
ami then" by K. -K. Kreps and H. T. j
Boland. impersonating a negro revival
meeting in the backwoods and
inkes told in the minstrel i
fashion, brought forth considerable |
laughter.
i
The close of the exercises was fea-!
Hired by the "transfer of the mantle" '
by .lames C. Kinard as president of j
tho senior class to Benedict Mayer as :
l^res.'dent of the junior class. Mr.'
Kinard's remarks were very appro- j
prlate for the occasion and Mr. May
?r s response was well spoken and
made a good impression.
These exercises are spicy and full
of fun and life and highly interesting
and when the public is made to know j
i
this, these exercises will be among
the most largely attended meetings of
commencement week.
Jams B. Hunter, Esq., will deliver
