IRE IRE mm SURVIVORS
Admiral Jellico Reports That Four Boats Left Sinking
Vessel, But Nothing Has Been Heard of Them
Since?Action at London.
(By Associated Press.)
LONDON, June 6?Admiral Jellicoe, commander of the
British grand fleet has reported to the Admiralty that the
British cruiser Hampshire with Eearl Kitchener and staff
aboard has been lost off the west Orkneys. Four boats
were seen to leave the Hampshire but a heavy sea was run
ning. Only a capsized boat and some bodies have been
found.
Earl Kitchener was on his way to Russia.
Admiral Jelico reports there is but little hope that there
were any survivors. The Admiral's report to the admiral
ty follows:
, "I have to roport with deep regret that Ills Majesty's ship, Hampshire,
Captain Herbert J. Saville, It. N. with Lord Kitchener and his taff aboard was
sunk last night at about 8 p. m. to the west of the Orkneys either by mine or
torpedo.
"Four boats were seen by observers on shore to leave the ship. The wind
was northwest aud a heavy was running. Patrol vessels and destroyers at
| once proceeded to the spot and a party was sent along the coast to search but
only some bodies and a capsized boat have been found up to the present
As the whole shore has been searched from the seaward, I greatly fear there
is little hope of their being any survivors. No report has yet been received
from the search party on shore."
When the news of the sinking of the Hampshire reached
London, a meeting of the British war council was imme
diately called. Sir William Robertson chief of the Imper
ial staff who probably will become head of the War office,
Sir Edward Grey, Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Reginal
McKenna, chancellor of the exchequer and David Lloyd
George, minister of Munitions were present at the council.
, Earl Kitchener was appointed secretary of state for
war August 8,1914, a few days after Great Britain's dec
laration of war on Germany. He was regarded as En
gland's greatest soldier and the decision of the govern
ment to entrust him with supreme direction of the war
was received with unanimous approval. As the war pro
gressed and Great Britain's deficiencies in certain direc
tions, particularly in regard to a shortage of artillery am
munition became apparent Earl Kitchener was subjected
to severe criticism led by Lord Northcliffe. The Secretary
.was charged with responsibility for failure to foresee the
extraordinary demand for heavy shells and as a result the
ministry of munitions was formed with David Lloyd
George at its head. Earl Kitchener's responsibilities
were further lessened by the appointment of General Sir
William Robertson as chief of the Imperial staff in Decem
ber of last year. It was reported at that time that friction
had arisen between Earl Kitchener and Field Marshal
French in command of British forces in France. Shortly
after the appointment of General Robertson, Field Mar
shal French relinquished command.

Cold, Hard Man
Who Could Do
Hard Things
- - j.
Of several things that entitle Earl
Kitchener to a place In world history,
tho most notable Is that he organized
the largest volunteer army the world
has ever seen, In the greatest war of
all times.
Within a year from the sudden out
break ot the European war in August
1914 the ranks ot British fighting men
000.
All other Great Powers that entered
tho war had huge standing armleB and
compulsory military service. Great
Britain alone faced the issue with con
fidence that its people would readily
respond to the call of JKng and country
without compulsion, and the precipi
tous developments that led to the war
fouud both the people and the govern
ment unanimous in the verdict that
Kltcnener of Khartum was the man to
lead lu the recruiting and organization
of the necessary army.
It was not a sentimental clamor, for
though Kitchener was a proven hero
of many campaigns, his personality
was as Impenetrable as hardened steel,
and he was not a hero that could be
loved; even the War Office had no
I pronounced liking for him, but on all
| sides tnere was profound respect for
his military efficiency and for all he
had done to extend the domains of the
British Empire. , 4
By more luck Kitchener happened
to bo in England on oneiof the com
paratively rare visits that he had paid
to London during his carer abroad,
when the European war broke out. He
had just come home from service as
British agent In Egypt, had accepted
an Earldom from King George. arid
was being talked of as Viceroy of In
dia. Within a few; hours atfer Eng
land's declaration of war, Kitchener
was appointed Secretary of State for
War and immediately took full charge
at the War Office where he worked
day and night to overcome the handi
cap which the Central Powers had ov
or England in the matter of fighting
I strength.
I He grimly told the British people
they had a bigger war on their hands
I than they realized, and one that might
last longer than they expected, but

or the FalhScmt High Scflj? had tholr
final romp together last tight In the 1
auditorium of the school, when the
class exercises were held. The audi*
torlum was filled with admiring rela
tives and friends of the young people. I
and all and sundry were kept interest
ed every minute of the time the en
tertainment lasted with one of the
moBt unique and interesting pro
grams ever given by a High school
graduating class.
The exercises began promptly at
8:15 when the membors of tjie class
filed into their accustomed seats in
the center of the auditorium and then
marched onto the stage as they sang
"Fairyland Waltz."
The first number on the program
was the presentation by Miss May
Hawkins of the class history. This
was made a part of the four volume
history of Marion county which has
been compiled by the member oT the
class under the direction of the fac
, ulty. A complete copy of this his
tory was presented to the school li
brary by Miss Hawkins.
Then followed one of, the amusing
features of the eveniug, the reading
of the class will by Sidney L?vin. Mr.
Levin impersonated an old fashioned
Justice of the Peace in the act of
reading a testament, but the scroll
from which he read testified to the
esteem in which the members of the
class held the faculty and expressed
regret at the fact that the students
were about to leave the precincts
they love so well.
The class prophesy was a popu
lar number with the audience. The
members of the class and their spon
sor were shown twenty years hence,
some being captains, governors, law
yers, gypsies, widows and, the best of
all, Miss May Hawkins was depicted
as President of the United States. The

for a picnic at Tygart Valley Club,
a distanco of Bin miles up the Tygart's
Valley river The rain prevented many
of the students wearing their ouflng
apparel, but they were in no danger
of getting soaked, as the barge in
which they made the Journey was cov

that 8ebaaU*Bl, minister ot public at

Farmer's Turning Out In
Larger Numbers Than
City Men.
Probabilities Are That the
Count Will be Completed
Early.
- Ttw drizzling rain that h?R fattenatt
day long together with uncertainty and
doubt among many of the voters an
to their right to participate in the pri
mary election has held the rote in
Marlon county down to less than halt
the eipected turn out today. Reports
from tie majority ot the forty seven
precincts in the county at press lime
this afternoon indicate that the entire
vote cast Including both parties will
be in the neighborhood of 5,000'rath
er than the expected ten or twelve
thousand that are on the registration
books.
Tho country vote held up better than
the city vote, ficcordlng to tho reports
as the rain prevented th'o farmers
and rural inhabitants from working
and a fair turn out to the polls was
the result In Manulngton and Fair
mont however the vote was much
lighter than usual despite the fact that
ninny of the candidates and party
workers by the offering of their cars
to theft1 followers brought out many
voters that ordinarily would not have
reached the polls.
Some of the Robinson supporters
say that the prisoners in the county
Jail were let out to visit the polling
place In the court house on tho .condi
tion that they vote for Abe Lilly for
Governor on the Repubican ticket.
Tom Buckley was a faithful attend
ant In the corridors outside the court
home polling place but would make
no official statement on whether or
not this had been done.
Quiet order prevaled at most ot the
precinct polls and tho usual group of
advisors and men detailed o encour
age the timid voter in performing his
sacred duty was not In evidence as at
tho general election. Even the court
house polling place whlcY is usually
thronged at general elections with boa.
Itatlng and undecided voters was re
markaby free from anything like a
crowd. A few men were to be seen
holding conferences in dark comers
but in moBt cases these were the regu
lar inmates of the building and they
were most likely discussing " cabbag
es and kings" and doubtless had for
gotten that the first West Virginia
state-wide primary election was In
progress.
The general opinion among the elec
tion officials and other Interested per
sons is that the result of the election
In this county will easily be known
by midnight The majority of the
counties thoughout this state will be
heard from by tomorrow noon and to
morow's West Virginian will carry
the complete result of the election in
both parties as far as It can be accu
rately determined. The vote in Ma
rlon county will be given in detail by
precincts.
