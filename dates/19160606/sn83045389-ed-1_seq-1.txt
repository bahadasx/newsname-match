CHICAGO, June 5.?Representatives
of th" several candidates for the Re- j
publican nrepirtenti.il nomination arc in
a perplexing prredicament to-night.
Having fostered sentiment In favor of ?
.Justice Hughes until they felt suro
r'olnnel Koosevelt was definitely e}Iml-|
natcd, they now fear they cannot con
trol the Hughes movement.
During the day it grew to the. propor
tion? of a boom. Effort Is being inadn
to concentrate all elements against it,
and the indications are that the veto:
of the Progressive party, which, of
< ourse, nieane Colonel Roosevelt's dis
approval of Huehes, may he sought as
i check
Harmony, abov? everything else, is
the desire of the leaders. Without it
any nominee would answer the purpose,
because it is recognized that unless the
Republicans and Progressives get to
uether their chances of success at the
polls are very slim To obtain har
mony, the Republican leaders are will
ing to concede to Colonel Roosevelt
the veto power in some form. Some
of the leaders say he should be willing
to select one or two men who would
l?e acceptable to him from the list of
candidates in the field. Others think
h? should Ruggem men for considera
tion by the convention leaders, and
practically all of the party chiefs are
willing to admit thai any of the candi
dates definitely rejected by Colonel
Roosevelt could not be nominated

lup.trtial observers within the Re
publican ranks do not consider that
Mie unexpected growth of the Hughes
bootu Is necessarily an indication of
personal popularity of the Justice
Muong the delegates. Those who pro
moted it in opposition to what proved
to he an exaggerated Idea of the ex
pected demand for the nomination of
Roosevelt were surprised at its growth.
The individual candidates were work
ing independently, and, therefore, there
was no canvass of the extent to which
Hughes was the second choice of their
supporters. This was found to be far
more general than had been antici
j ated.
\Vi*.h the arrival of hundreds of dele
gates to-day the sentiment In favor of
Hughes reached high tide, aiul, in spite
of the concentration upon him of the
opposition forces, he appears to be far
in the lead. Managers of the fa
vorite sot! candidacies have made no
headway to combine against Hughes,
because he i.s the second choice of
many of the Instructed delegates, and
trading is dangerous. Kvery attempted
transfer, it is feared, would result in
spilling some delegates into the Hughes
basket. Unless the situation changes
\ erv soon, these delegates are almost
certain to flop to him. should there be
more than two or three ballots without
a nomination.
All thought of getting a preconven- '
tir.n statement from Justice Hughes
was abandoned during the day. A de-i
mand w;.s made to-night that Colonel
Roosevelt either should come here and .
?*ke part in the councils, or place his
spokesman In a position to answer
questions as to what candidate or can
didates would be acceptable to him to
defeat Hughes, it was not helieved any
of these demands would he met.

A number of Roosevelt adherents!
themselves helieved the Colonel should'
come to Chicago. Strangely enough,!
the Old Guard leaders would welcome j
Colonel Roosevelt. Some of them ar- j
g'ied that if he came here a union of
the Republicans and Progressives
would be assured. Kfforts of the Pro
gressive National Committee to-day to
:lx a time for nominations In their con.
vention resulted in conflicting state
ments of what had been agreed upon.
Some said a nomination would bo de
ferred until Saturday, and others de
nied that such a delay had been agreed !
upon, and that a nomination was pos- j
fible* not later than Thursday.
After the Progressive National Com-j
inittee had held its conference, inter
mediaries between Republican and Pro
gressive headquarters bogan to op
erate. The result of several prelimi
nary conferences brought Senator
I.odge and George W. Perkins together.
When Senator I,odge went into the
conference it was admitted that th*
purpose was to discuss convention plans
in an effort to reach some agreement
to avert another third party ticket.
The conference continued nearly two
hours, during which Mr. Perkins fre
quently was called to the telephone. I

Justice Charles E. Hugh<*s to-day innrle
h!a first public address since the open
ing- of the preconvention campaign. He
told the young women graduute-s that
the flag meant America first, an un
divided allegiance, and a nation united
and eiiu.il to its tasks.
"This flue means more than associ

it- the symbol of our national unity, our

tion. It tells you o* the struggle for
independence, of union preserved, of
liberty and union one and inseparable.

scorns self-indulgence, weakness and
rapacity. It is eloquent of our com
mon interests, outwalghing all diver
gences of opinion; and of our common
destiny.
"Given as a prize to those who have
the highest standing, it happily en
forces the lesson that intelligence and
zeal must go together; that discipline
must accompany emotion, and that we
must ultimately rely upon enlightened
opinion."
Under the custom of the school, the
student to stand at the h-ad of the
graduating class receives as a reward
the flag which has flown over the school
grounds all year. Several months ago
Justice Hughes was invited to make
the presentation address, but no an
nouncement of his acceptance ever was
made. Miss ^Catherine Hughes, daugh
ter of the Justice, was a member of the
graduating class, but she missed the
coveted honor of -winning the rlag by
a few points, taking rank among the
first ten.

Hughes told the graduates that the.
intellectual inheritance of the age
counted only as it actually was pos

miserable spectacle to see the youth

small and impoverished amid (he. op

TO BE WITH CONVENTION
Consideration fiivrn to Some of Out
standing Features by Party
leaders.
FORM BASIS FOR DISCUSSION
Kvery Kflfort Will He Made to In
corporate So mo Progressive Party
Ideas?Great Prominence Will Re
Given to Americanism.
CHICAGO. June it?Although the dis
position among Republican leaders is
to leave decision on the platform to the
convention itself, consideration was
piven to-day to outstanding features.
Advance preparation lias been lacking,
but Senators Lodge. Borah. Sutherland
and many others in the Senate and
House have considered suggestions for
many weeks. Those probably will form
the basis for discussion in the com
mittee on resolutions, with the conven
tion as the final Judge.
Every effort will be made in the plat
form, If the suggestions are followed,
to incorporate somo Progressive party
ideas. A recall plank probably will not
be approved, but a strong fight will
be made for an indorsement of woman
suffrage.
The three Senators' first thought has
been to give greatest prominence to
Americanism, Senator Sutherland has
gone so far as to suggest that this
word should be used as a key to the
whole superstructure. His belief la
that a satisfactory platform could be
constructed upon that principle, and
that even the tariff plnnk could be
made to fit into a declaration for
Americanism only.
SI I'I'OHT DFCI.A RATION
fOIl XATIO.V.VLISM
While not committing themselves
entirely to this plan of procedure, other
platform builders support an out-and
out declaration for nationalism. Some
of them are inclined to the belief that
this plan might result in too great
restriction, and thus cxclude many
necessary matters. ?
Some also are getting away fror the
thought that the platform should be
exceptionally brief. "We don't want
to be uselessly prolix." said Senator
liorah, 'but we cannot, and must not,
overlook the fact that the Republican
party is out of power, and, that being
the case, we owe it to the country to
present a comprehensive statement of
the basis of our appeal for support."
As thi* draft stands, it is at once a
criticism of the Democratic manage
ment of foreign affairs ns vacillating
and unsatisfactory, and a pronounce
ment in lavor of the protection of the
lives and property of American citizens
at homo and abroad.
The Democratic direction of affairs
in connection with Mexico will be at
tacker! with special severity, hut no
declaration for actual intervention in
Mexico is contemplated. An army and
navy adequate to the protection of
American interests will be advocated
as the best means of preserving peace
and protecting the national honor.
! he tariff plank will include not only
the usual Republican pronouncement in
support of the principle of protection,
but in nddltion there will be an asser
tion of the inadequacy cf tin- present
tariff law to meet revenue demands,
it will be claimed that but for the
stimulus of the war, business in I he
United States would have suffered many
hardships as a result of the t'nd.-nviiod
Siintnons law, while at the same time
the Treasury would have been con
tinuously empty. Promise will be made
of an immediate revision advantageous
both to the national Treasury and pri
vate business. A tariff commission will
be demanded in the Interest of the sta
bility and equality of the tariff.
Much attention is to be given to fea
tures of the platform which it is be
lieved will appeal to former members
of the party who supported Colonel
Roosevelt four years ago. To this end
r? solutions have been prepared cover
ing most of the distinctive points of
the Progressive platform of 1012.
These do not include an indorsement
of the recall, but they do embrace the
subject of woman susffrage. The advo
cates of the suffrage provision expect a
fight, but say they have an equal
chance to win.
Senator I.odge. it is conceded, will
be chairman of the resolutions com
mittee. He has tilled this position in
previous conventions, and it Is believed
his experience as well as his knowl
edge of legislation and of foreign and
domestic affairs will greatly facilitate
its work.

LONDON. June 5.?The latest reports
received by the British Admiralty
enable the Associated Press to give
the foll'?vlng review of the naval en
gage.n*ent as viewed from the British
side:
During the night of May 31-June. I,
British destroyers made ft determined
at lark on the retreating German battle
fleet, which hastened its flight. The
Brlt'sh tleet remained on the scene
during the morning of June 1, and
traversed the field four times, finding
no enemy. The oommnnder-in-chief
look his tleet back to its bases, and five
hours after Its arrival reported the
battle fleet ready for action.
As regards the German losses, definite
evidence, it is declared, has now been
obtained that they were deliberately
falsified, and that the following were
destroyed:
Two battle cruisers; one at least,
and probably two battleships; four
light cruisers, eight destroyers and one
submarine.
The remainder of the German battle
cruiser squadron may have reached
home ports, but the ships were all
severely damaged, as also were ships
of the Koenig class, which came under
the fire of a portion of the. British
buttle fleet.
Besides the above, the Associated
Press has obtained Information from
returned officers of the fleet that they
are able to identify the lost German
battle cruisers as the Hlndenburg and
the l.utzow.
Naval officials here point out that,
j on account of their proximity to home
ports, some of the German vessels
which were as badly injured as was
the British cruiser Warrior, would
have been able to make port.
The Hindenburg has hitherto been
classified as a battleship.

KItOM tiERMAX SOl llCES
AMSTERDAM, June 5 (via London).?
The following semiofficial account of the
naval battle off Jutland has been re
ceived hero from Berlin:
?'The German high seas fleet had
pushed out into the North Sea In the
hope of engaging portions of the Eng
lish tleet, which had recently been re
peatedly reported off the Norwegian
south coast. At 3:15 in the afternoon.
some seventy miles off Skager-Bak,
some small cruisers of the Calliope
class were sighted. Our cruisers at
once pursued the enemy, which tied
northward at highest speed.
"At G:20 our cruisers sighted two
enemy columns to the west, consisting
of six battle cruisers and a great num
ber of small cruisers.
"The enemy passed towards tho
south and our ships, approaching to
nineteen kilometers, opened very effec
tive tire on southern - southeastern
courses. During tho battle two Eng
lish battle cruisers and one destroyer
were sunk.
"After half an hour's lighting, heavy
enemy re-enforcements, later observed
to be five vessels of the Queen Kliaa
.bcth class, were sighted to the north.
Soon afterwards the German'* main
force entered the fight. and the enemy
at once turned north.
"The British commander, driving bis
ships at full speed, attempted to evade
our extremely effective tire l>.v taking
an echelon formation. Our ileut fol
lowed at top speed the movements of
the enemy. in the course of this
period of the fighting, one cruiser of
the Achilles or Shannon class and two
destroyers were sunk, while a number
of other vessels t ufYered heavy dam
age.
"The battle against superior forces
lasted until darkness fell. Besides
numerous light detachments, at least
twenty-five British battleships, six
battle cruisers ami four armored
cruisers engaged sixteen German bat
tleships. five battle cruisers, six older
ships of the line and no armored
cruisers
"After dark our fleet opened a night
attack. During this attack several
cruisers and torpedo-boat engagements
occurred, resulting in the destruction
of one battle cruiser, one cruiser of tho
Achilles class. probably two small
cruihers and at least ten destroyers.
Six of the latter, including the new
destroyer leaders Turbulent and Tip
perar.v, were destroyed by the leading
vessels of our high seas tleet. Th?i
British squadron of older battleship*,
which hurried up from the south, did
not arrive until Thursday morning,
after tiie conclusion of the battle, and
returned without taking any part In
the Huhting or coining within sight of
our main force."
