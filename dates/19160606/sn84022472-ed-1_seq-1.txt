Civic spirit, engendered by a desire
f th4 older families of Bridgeport to
maintain the prestige of Golden Hill
will probably result in a combination
'of .business changes of momentous
import both to Fairfield and this city.
Negotiations now practically con
cluded will see the withdrawal of B.
W. Harral of this city from the presi
dency of the Fairfield Rubber. Co.,
the probable sale of the property to
large national interests, the purchase
of . the Star Shir$. factory at Golden
Hill and Washington averfue by Har
ral andother associates now living in
the vicuiity, and conversion of the
main building into an enormous aid
beautiful apartment house. ' i
While it is denied by Mr. Harral to
day that the sale of . the Fairfield
Rubber Co. has been, completed or
that deeds have-passed to those in
terested with him in the purchase of
the Star Shirt factory, it was admit
ted that the negotiations had gone be
' iyond -the stage where there is any
likelihood that "withdrawals from the
deals will be probable. '
Through well informed sources it-is
learned that the exclusive Golden Hill
leerfnmunity, once the most distinguish
ied section of Bridgeport, has long
looked with displeasure at the en
croaching commercialism. A recent
protest to the- common' council was
made against a garage location as far
. xemoved as Fairfield avenue, i ,
It is in view of the possibility of in
dustrial encroachment that the heirs
of many families closely identified
"with the wealth of historic associa
tions of the Hill, headed by Mr. Har:
ral, decided upon, the radical move
ment that will- result in the recon
struction, of the big factory building,

reopening and beautification of the
famous spring that once furnished all
Bridgeport with its water.
The Star Shirt factory, running un
der the operation of .William F. Mo
han and C. L. Bauscher, officers of the
corporation, living in New York city,
which was recently ordered closed, has
a most interesting history.
The site is. that of the old Goldeti
Hill Indian reservation, 1 it was once
e center for the tepees of the tribes,
ff or the ' best water available in that
cection gushed freely ftom the natural
rock fissures. .
Early in the colonization of Bridge
port, as distinct from Stratford, the
little community got much of its water
from the spring and prior tq 1824 a
man named Wetherbee obtained a
right to pipe the water around the
ecelivity now outlined by Harrison
and Elm streets to the corner of Main
Etreet and Fairfield avenue.
Old wooden pipes were used, to
convey the stream to what is now
Fairfield ' avenue , and Main streets,
where all aVailed themselves of the
water. Wetherbee was paid for
keeping the pipes in condition and
this was -Bridgeport's first water sys
tem. -
During the '30's Bridgeport became
interested in the manufacture of
'ehirts for large New York clothiers.
In 1849 'Thaddeus Barnes came from
New Haven to manufacture shirts for
C. B, Hatch & Co. of New Tork. The
eoftness and purity of the Golden Hill
epring appealed to him for the wash
ing of fabric and in- 1853-4 he erected
e. small building beside the spring.
He was progressive and is said to be
the first shirt manufacturer in the
world to adopt the use of the sewing
machine in that work for the Wheeler
& Wilson factory- was located here
End supplied him. He was among the
tfirst to introduce steam power to op
erate 'the machines. In 1858 C. B.
Hatch & Co. took over, the factory
end enlarged the buildings. An addi
tional and larger building was erected
In 1861 which survived until the
spectacular fire of 1906, when the
Jatest addition was built. -

tery of the supposed abduction of 16-year-old
Hovella May Curtis of Shef

by Detective James Dooley and as
they are now married, the charge
against Leonard will probably not be
pressed when bis case is called in the

continued this morning under bonds
of $1,000 which he was unable to fur

On May S0t "Miss Curtis disappeared
from herhome in Sheffield and her
parents at .once surmised that she hadi
gone away -with Leonard, a native of
Ashby, Mass., who had been employed,
in the Remington Arms plant in this
city for some time.. The tiro had been
sweethearts in the neighboring -towna
and when Leonard came to Bridge
port he became lonely and uecided to
ask Lovella to elope. 1
Her parents had opposed Leonard's!
attentions to the daughter so the
elopement was the only way that
Leonard could win the girl. Upon
lcoming to this city they went to the
home of the Rev. James Scjavill, a
Baptist minister living at the Hunt
ington road address,- and had the cer
emony performed. Leonard had been,
rooming -with Rev. Mr. Scovlll, so that
after he had tied the knot, they made
their home there. , "...
Yesterday Miss Curtis's fatherf and'
brother came to this city and caused
Leonard to be arrested at the Arms
company. When Detective Dooley-
took him to headquarters he refused
to give his address or state where the
girl rcould be found. 1
This morning when the detective
found where they lived and investi
gated he was informed by the minis
ter's wife that Leonard and his wife
appeared to be very happy. When the
marriage certificate was fouhd, the
father decided not to press the charge
against Leonard as he had married
the girl and he did not wish to make
the situation more uncomfortable.

hospital last night. Mystery surrounds
the identity of the autoist whose car
struck him.
Though the accident occurred
nearly a week ago, Szabo was not
taken to the hospital until two days
ago. Because of the delay in receiv
ing proper attention, death resulted.
Szabo was one of the workmen en
gaged in the' renovation of the club
house. When struck, he picked him
self up from the roact and is under
stood to have given no thought to the
fact that he might be seriously injur
ed. He was taken to -the hospital

"PEACE" CONFERENCE
BECOMING WARLIKE
Washington Speech of Jurist
is Liberally Handled By
Many Boomers. ,
Chicago, June 6 Immediately be
fore he went into- conference with
Republican leaders George W.
Perkins, leader of the Roosevelt ad
herents, today gave out a statement
declaring that Colonel Roosevelt had
not said that he would refuse to sup
port Justice Hughes or any other man
and assailed Hughes supporters for
making capital of his "preparedness
speech" in Washington last night.
Political leaders" who profess to be
willing to accept any man for the
presidential nomination who is able
to claim the support of both Republi
cans and Progressives, are trying to
day to determine whether Justice
Hughes has been strengthened or
weakened by the concentration of all
forces upon him with the avowed pur
pose of eliminating Colonel Roose-,
velt as a Republican possibility. Un
questionably the effect of the Hughes
drive has been to play the whole field
of candidates against him.-
Conferences between Republican
and Progressive leaders which lasted
far into the night were resumed early
today but it was not believed that any
of them had preceded far enough to
clarify the . situation within the next
few hours.
.The two latest elements to be
brought into consideration today were
Justice Hughes" speech in Washing
ton touching on Americanism and dis
cussion of Senator Lodge, of Massa
chusetts as a compromise candidate
for the Republican nation likely to
command the support of Col. Roose-:
velt.
Justice Hughes' supporters pointed
to his speech as a substantial declara
tion on Americanism and they- consid
ered that it cleared up the only issue
on which the justice had not previous
ly announced his attitude. They
contended that his public j utterance
before he went on the supreme court
bench made clear his position on all
other paramount issues and that in
asmuch as the question of American
ism has arisen since ie went into tne
seclusion of the court a statement on
that subject was the only thing to be
desired.
Those opposed to the justice char
acterized his speech as ''only a list of
platitudes" and charged that the
speech was carefullly timed for the
present occasion. As to the latter the
friends of the justice pointed out .that
his engagement to spealc was made
several weeks ago and that the subject
fitted the occasion -which was the pre
sentation of a flag to graduates of a
girls" school. '
The practical politicians, on the oth
er hand, almost unanimously 4jeld to
the view that the speech was without
significance in the present situation.
Almost overshadowing the maneuv
ering among Republicans today is the
question of what the Progressive con
vention" will do when It assembles to
morrow. The Republican leaders re
gard it as charged with possibilities
of the1 most potent sort. On every
hand they expect a tremendous dem
onstration for Colonel Roosevelt, de
spite efforts to hold back a nomination
until the Republicans have indicated
their purpose and there has been op
portunity for further conferences be
tween the two factions.
WOOD IS " ACCEPTABLE."
Oyster Bay. N. X., June 6 The
nomination of Gen. Leonard Wood for
the presidency would be "acceptable"
to Colonel Theodore Roosevelt as a
solution of the situation at Chicago,
a'ceording to two visitors ho called
unon the former president today Just
before he left for New York to visit
his publishers. They asserted that
rvilonel Roosevelt told them that
while he was "neither for nor against
any candidate," that General Wood
"would be the most acceptable to
him" and that he would "throw his
hat in the ring" and go out and work
for him as a candidate who is for a
"thoroughly United States" and whose
election would "mean the return of
the true spirit of Americanism."

Earl Kitchener was appointed sec

declaration of war on .Germany. He
was regarded as England's greatest

unanimous approval.
As the war progressed and Great
Britain's deficiencies in certain direc

Shanghai, June 6 Yuan Shi Kai, president of the Chinese
Republic, died yesterday morning.
Yuan Shi Kai was reported to have been taken seriously ill
on May 29. At that time despatches from China stated it was
believed in Peking that the President had been poisoned but this
report was denied by the Chinese ambassador at Washington
who insisted that the President was not even ill.
Yuan Shi Kai died -while the storms
of revolution were gathering in in
creasing strength. The revolt broke
out in December, 1915, when the
President announced . his intention of
establishing a monarchy and ascend
ing the throne as the 'first emperor of
a new dynasty.
His coronation was set for early
in February of this year, tout was post
poned indefinitely owing to the revolt
in southern China. Several attempts
were made upon the President's life
and a bomb plot was discovered in the
imperial palace.
The establishing of a monarchy was
strenuously opposed by Japan and the
final abandonment of the plan was
largely credited to the representations
made by Tokio. The revolt progress

FRENCH REPULSE
GERMAN ATTACKS
AGAINST VERDUN
Paris, June 6 Two attacks by the
Germans on the French lines at Forts
Vaux and Damloup on ' the Verdun
front, were repulsed by the French
last night, according to an official
statement issued by the war office to
day. ' The heavy bombardment of
Fort Vaux continues with intermit
tent cannonading on the West front.
Fort Vaux, one of the northeastern
defenses of Verdun, continues to be
the center of German efforts, but the
French still hold the main fort and
all approaches except the northern
moat, in which the Germans gained
lodgement several days ago.
The Germans are now directing
their efforts toward bringing up
masses of- reinforcements through the
ravines between Vaux and Damloup
for the purpose of gradually wearing
down the resistance of the French.
Two infantry attacks- were made yes
terday but they lacked the intensity of
the previous rushes. The conclusion
is drawn, 'by French commentators
that the heavy recent losses of the
Germans are compelling them to pro
ceed less vigorously for the moment
while they are re-forming their scat
tered and decimated units.
Berlin, June 6 French troops on
the right bank of the river Meuse
in the Verdun section last night made
four determined efforts to eject the

of his achievements is the creation

LASHAR'S PLANT
IN PENNSYLVANIA
TO BE IMPROVED
Announcement made today discloses
that the Pardy Construction Co. of
this city has obtained contracts for the
erection of a large addition to the
American Chain Co., plants at York,
Pa.
The fact that these buildings were
not erected in this city is said not to
reflect detrimentally upon Bridgeport
where is located the American Chain
Co., of which Walter B. Lashar is a
director, although they would prob
ably have been built here but for the
scarcity of housing.
The. principal reason for the York
building, it is said today in the ab
sence of Mr. Lashar from this city, is
the fact that the Standard Chain Co.,
a subsidiary of the American Chain
Co. .makes a different product from
that turnedout here.
An additional feature is that the
plant here has found such difficulty in
getting housing accommodations fo rits
own workmen that plans have been
considered by Mr. Lashar to erect
about 50 houses at his company's ex
pense and resell them upon -convenient
terms to workers in his plant.
What final steps have been taken in
this respect cannot be learned until
Mr. Lashar's return to Bridgeport.
The factories, which will be begun
at once in York by the -Pardy Con
struction Co., which was awarded the
contracts last week, will consist of
two five story brick buildings, 300 feet
long and two buildings 150 feet long,
six stories in height. They will ac
commodate about 2,000 hands.

Heavy Seas, and it is Feared That All of These I
Capsized.
London, June 6 Earl Kitchener, British Minister ,of War J
and his staff were lost last night when the cruiser Hampshire
was sunk west of the Orkneys.
Kitchener and his staff were on their way to Russia.
Admiral Jellicoe, commander of the British grand fleet, re- j
ported to the Admiralty that the Hampshire was sunk by a mine
or torpedo. Only four boats were launched before the vessel
went down. -
- Fear All On Board Lost
- A capsized boat and several bodies have been recovered. Ilj
is feared that the other boats and their occupants were lost as a-
heavy sea was funning when they were launched. i
The body of Earl Kitchener has not been recovered accords j
ing to the Admiralty announcement.
With Earl Kitchener as his personal staff were: Hugh
James O'Beirne, former councillor of the British embassy at j
Petrograd and former minister at Sofia; O. A. Fitzgerald, Earl I
Kitchener's private military secretary; Brig.-Gen. Elloishaw and j
Sir Frederick "Donaldson.
Official reports to the Admiralty are hat there is little hope ;
that any of the crew of the Hampshire escaped.
v Admiral JeHicoe's Official Report
' Admiral Jellicoe's report follows:
. "1 have tQ report with deep rejiTet that His Majesty's ship
Hampshire,' Captain Herbert J. Savill, R. N., -with Lord Kitchener
and his staff on board, was sunk last night attabout .8 o'clock, to
the west of the Orkneys, either by a mine or a torpedo. y '
"Four boats were seen by observers on shore to leave the
ship. The wind was- north-northwest and heavy Keas were run
ning. Patrol boats at once proceeded to the spot and a party:
was sent along the coast to search but only some bodies and a,
capsized boat have beeri found up to the present. As practically;
the whole shore has been searched from the seaward I greatly1!
fear that there is little hope of there being any survivors.
"No report has yet been received from the search partjr on;
shore:
"H. M. S. Hampshire was on
The Hampshire was one of the
Devonshire class of six cruisers and
was built in 1903. Her normal crew
was 655 men. She displaced 10,850
tons, and was 450 feet long. Her
armament consisted of four 7.5 inch,
six 6 inch, two 12-pound and twenty
3-pound guns and two torpedo tubes.
The Hampshire 'has been in use as
a scout boat and for carrying officials
on various missions. She was too old
to take a place on the fighting line.
She was one of the British squadron
which was sent to this country for the
Jamestown Exposition in 1907. ,
The Orkney Islands, toff which,the
Hampshire went down, are off the
north coast of Scotland. , The Hamp
shire was on- her way into the Atlantic
and arounck the northern end of the
Scandinavian peninsula into the White
Sea. Earl Kitclrener probably Intend
ed to debark at Angel.
When the news of the .sinking of
the cruiser Hampshire with Earl
Kitchener and hip staff on-board, -was
received in London, a meeting of the
British war council was immediately
called. Sir William Bobertson, chief
of the Imperial Staff, who probably
will be the head of the war office; Sir
Edward Grey, secretary for foreign
affairs; Reginald McKenna, chancel
lor or the exchequer, and David Lloyd
George, minister: of munitions, ' were
present at the council.
The newspaper accounts at the war
offices, who at the time had not heard
the news regarding Earl Kitchener,
announced:
"Neither Earl Kitchener nor Pre
mier Asquith was present."
The death of Earl Kitchener caused
as profound an impression in London
as did the news last week of the na
val battle in the . North . Sea. . The
work of the secretary at one stage of
the war was the subject of great dis
cusslon and considerable questioning
but there has been a strong reaction
in the public mind in the last two
months and Earl Kitchener's popular
ity and prestige appeared to have been
restored fully. j
The first question asked -when the
news of Kitchener's death was an
nounced was: """v
"Who will succeed him?"'
The answer invariably was: "Rob
ertson, of course."
Sir William Robertsoft, who is re
garded as the only possible successor
to Earl Kitchener as the head of the
British army, already had taken over
the war secretary's duties temporari
ly when the secretary started on his
illl-fated Journey. On Saturday and
again yesterday he had audiences with
King George to report on the activi
ties on the British front, in which the
Canadians have so distinguished them
selves. The general has the full confidence
of the country. While he cannot be
come secretary of war unless he is
raised to the peerage, a member of
the . House of Lords migbt be put at
the head of the war office with, the

Li
her way to Russia."
understanding that the general. Ilk
Earl Kitchener, would have a free
rein.
Earl Kitchener's conference on Fri
day with members of the House of
Commons, when he explained confi
dentially, the nilitary situation, was a
remarkable incident. Two hundred
members gathered to talk with him.
Extraordinary precautions were tak
'en to keep outsiders from the pre
cincts of Westminster palace. j
Earl Kitchener generally made rath-
er a poor impression as a speaker, j
since he always read his statements
from manuscripts 'ana did not talk in !
an effective way. On this occasion,
however, he conversed freely with the
members, answering questions from
some critics who showed considerable !
bias. ' '
After leaving the conference some
of the members of the. conference de-J
clared their judgment of Earl Kit
chener's work had been enhanced by
his explanations.
Sir- Frederick Donaldson, among
those who accompanied Lord Kitch
ener on the Hampshire, was technical j
adviser to' David Lloyd George, min- j
ister of munitions. He was prominent
in the engineering world, being a past
president of the institute of mechani
cal engineers and a member of the
Iron and steel institute and of various
engineering societies. Before the war
he was chief" mechanical engineer of
ordnance factories from 1899 to 1903
and chief superintendent after that
date. He was born in 1856.
Hugh James O'Beirne, in addition to
other posts he held during a long
career in the diplomatic service, was
second secretary to-" the British em
bassy in Washington from 18 95 to
1898. He was 50 years old and a
native of Ireland.
Brigadier General Arthur Eller
shaw, who was born in 1869 and en
tered the army in 188 8, won honors
in fighting on the Indian frontier in
1898. He was severely wounded in
the Boer war. In the present war he
had gained the distinguished service
order.
Lieut. Colonel Oswald Arthur Eitz-;
gerald, who had been personal mili
tary secretary to Lord Kitchener since
August, 1914, had been closely as
sociated with the late Field Marshal
in army service for many years.
