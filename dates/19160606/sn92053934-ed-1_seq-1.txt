Yuan Shi-kai had been ill for sev -

was followed by a nervous break

Quiet prevails today in the capital.
The death of the president apparently
solves trie neatert political crisis. Li

to the extraordinary- rapiditv with
which the revolt spread through south

The establishment of a monarchv

and the final abandonment of the plan
was largely due to the representations
made by Tokio.
H as A hie Thief.
In recent years Yuan Shi-kai had
become the most conspicuous person
ality of the orient through his efforts
to bring his 400.000.000 fellow yellow
men into line as citizens of the new
republic of China. The task of turn
ing this most ancient and backward of
kingdoms into a republic within whose
confines there is a fifth of the world's
inhabitants a republic four times as
large as the United States was ob
viouslv no easv one and the man who
attempted it did not escape storms of)
criticism from those who held that he
was a dictator, virtually founding a
new dynasty. But among foreigners
generally Yuan Shi-kai was given j
credit for as able an administration as
could be expected under the circum
stances. Long before Yuan Shi-kai was wide
lv know abroad he had been accepted
by the Manchus, the Chinese, and the !
foreigners in China as a coming man.
Born in 1S59, the son of a district
governor in the province of Honan,
Yuan Shi-kai aspired to an official
position, but the rule was that official
life was open only to those who passed
in ancient classics. Yuan utterly failed
in one of those government tests at
which thousands of aspirants are clos
eted for three days undergoing exam
ination. He went into Korea as a secretary
with the army, and there rose rap
idly through his display of military
and diplomatic ability. The famous
Grand Chancellor Li Hung-chang rec
ognized in him a man of action and ap
pointed his Chinese resident at Seoul.
This was the highest post in the em
pire, and Yuan held it when he was
only 2 years old. When the Japanese
drove the Chinese out of Korea, he
was one of the few to return to Pe
king still in the favor of the court,
(.aiiied Fame in Jap War.
He rose to great prominence through
lis effective reorganization of the
army afvr the war with Japan had
shown its weaknesses. It is general
ly beld that he assisted the empress
dowager ;n effecting a coup d'etat in
by which she wrested the throne
from the Emperor Kuang Shu, and he
was popularly accused of betraying
the emperor. The dowager appointed
him governor of Shantung, where,
during the Boxer rebellion, he
displayed his astuteness. Invited
to join the Boxer sect, he
dared not frankly refuse, al
though he had no sympathy for their
fanaticism. He agreed to join the Box
er movement if its leaders would prove
to him their contention that those of
their sect were immune to foreign
bullets. He told them he had one of
the foreign guns in his own house and
that if the leaders would meet him in
his garden the next day he would
stand them up against the wall and
try the -foreign devils' magic" on
them. f the bullets did not hurt.
Yuan would become a Boxer. So su-

JUSTICE IN SPEECH
Sphinx-like Presidential Can-
didate Gives ViCWS On
Public Questions.
Chicago, Jnne fir Immediately
before he went into conference
with republican leaders, George
W. Perkins, leader of the Roose
velt adherents, today gave out a
statement, declaring that Colonel
Roosevelt had not said that he
would refuse to support Justice
Hughes or any other man and as
sailed Hnghes supporters for mak
ing capital of his "preparedness
speech," as was hinted last night.
Continued conferences today be
tween republican and progressive
leaders failed to disclose common
ground on which they can agree on
candidates and issues.
Justice Hughes remained the lead
ing figure in point of strength when
first and second choices were consid-
i ered and Colonel Roosevelt still was
conceded a veto power in the repub
lican convention whether he would
exercise it against Justice Hughes in
advance of the balloting was a ques
tion in the minds of the leaders.
Ieny Disapproval of Hughes.
George W. Perkins issued a state
ment denying Colonel Roosevelt ever
had declared his disapproval of Jus
tice Hughes or any other man.
- Progressive leaders admitted that in
their harmony conferences with rep
resentatives of the regular republican
i forces they had been at a disadvantage
j in that they had only one candidate
jto ofter, while the republicans ad-1
vanced the names of all the favorite
sons and Justice Hughes as well.
Explain Lodge Movement.
It was because of this situation, it
is believed, thattalk of Senator Lodge
was started last night and they let it
become known that Senator Lafollette
previously had been suggested to the
republicans. Neither of these sugges
tions aroused any enthusiasm. The
importance to the progressives of
having a list of compromise possibili
ties to counter balance the republican
list of candidates as recognized even
by Roosevelt who at Oyster Bay today
added the name of Major General
Leonard Wood, giving out a statement
that the general would be "acceptable"
to him.-
The managers of the Hughes move
ment are confronted in any attempt
to deal with the progressives with the
charge that they are not the author
ized representatives of the justice.
Washington, 1). C, June 6. For the
first time since attention has been cen
tered upon him as a possible presiden
tial candidate Justice Hughes, in a pub
lic address disclosed, at least partially,
his attitude on the question of prepar
edness. The occasion for the speech was the
annual ceremony of the presentation
of a national flag to the honor mem
bers of the graduating class of the Na
tional Cathedral school, where his
daughter is a pupil.
In presenting the flag he said:
"It means America first; it means an
undivided allegiance. It means Amer
ica united, strong and efficient, equal
to her tasks. It means that you can
not be saved by the valor and devotion
of your ancestors; that to each genera
tion comes its patriotic duty, and that
upon your willingness to sacrifice and
endure, as those before you have sacri
ficed and endured, rests the national
hope."
"In these last school days," Justice
Hughes continued, "your hearts are full
of the perfect joy of friendship, and the
dominant thought is doubtless of the
associations which have been more po
tent in their influence than either the
study or precept. The teachers you
love mean more to you than the sub
jects they have taught. It is because
of the winning power of their person
ality and your response to the mes
sage of their lives that memory will
ever turn fondly to this spot.
Discipline the, Word.
"But while all this is implied, the
ceremony of today has a distinctive
significance in its recognition of schol
arship. This is a place of serious in
tellectual discipline. Intellectual in
terests are not sacrificed to meet the
whims of folly or the indifference of
the thoughtless.
"We are the 'heirs of all the ages
in the foremost files of time,' but this
vast inheritance counts as we actually
possess it and use it. It is a miserable
spectacle to see youth neglecting the
lessons of science, the instruction of
history, the resources of literature and
art, and leading a life small and im
poverished amid the opportunities of
the ioth century.
"Peculiarly is it necessary for us to
realize the need of thorough, well di
rected training. The school is the pow
er house of democracy. You cannot

Chicago, June 6. Cook county paid
her respects to the republican and pro

day by electing a complete slate of
democratic judges to the superior
court
A11 of the. sitting democratic judges
Burke, Dever, McDonald, Cooper and
Gridley were reelected by majorities
averaging around 25,000.
Municipal Court Judge John J. Sul
livan, democrat, was elevated to the
superior bench by a majority nearly as
large over the high republican, Mu
nicipal Judge Hosea W. Wells. Judge
Robert E. Turney, the only sitting re
publican judge, was defeated.
For the superior court vacancy
caused by the resignation of Judge
Henry V. Freeman, Joseph B. David,
democrat, defeated Andrew J. Red
mond by approximately 20,000 major
ity. John T. Richards and Russell Whit
man, independents, running on the pro
gressive ticket, did not figure in the
halloting, fall;ng behind the lowest of
the six socialist candidates.
The two city bond issues one for
bridge construction and the other for

were carried. The county jail bond is

The vote was the lightest that has
been cast in a Chicago election in many
years. The total vote in the county,
as indicated by incomplete returns at
10 o'clock, was less than 140,000.
The result was generally considered
as a sweeping victory for the regular
democratic organization controlled by
Roger C. Sullivan. It named the dem

to work all over the city. The ma

Disaster Occurs While Party
Is En Route to Russia,
Report Says.
London, June 6. Earl
Kitchener, British minister
of war, and his staff were on
board the British cruiser
which was sunk by a mine or
torpedo off the Orkneys. It
is feared that all are lost.
Admiral Jellicoe, commander of
the British grand fleet, has report
ed to the admiralty that the British
cruiser Hampshire, with Earl
Kitchener and his staff aboard has
been lost off the West Orkneys.
Four boats were seen to leave
the Hampshire bnt a heavy sea
was running. Only a capsized boat
and some bodies have been found.
Earl kitchener was on hi way
to Russia. Admiral Jellicoe re
ports there is little hope that there
were any survivors.
The names of the members of Earl
Kitchener's staff have not yet been
learned. Sir William Roberson, chief
of the imperial staff, is in London.
Admiral Jellicoe's report to the ad
miralty follows:
"I have to report with deep regret
that'hi3 majesty's ship Hampshire,
Captain Herbert J. Savill, R. N., with
Lord Kitchener and his staff on board,
was sunk last night at about 8 p. m. to
the west of the Orkneys, either by a
mine or a torpedo.
"Four boats were seen by observers
on shore to leave the ship. The wind
was north-northwest and heavy seas
were running. Patrol vessels and de
stroyers at once proceeded to the spot
and a party was sent along the coast
to search but only some bodies and a
capsized boat have been found up to
the present As the whole shore has
been searched from the seaward I
greatly fear that there is little hope of
there being any survivors.
"No report has yet been received
from the search party on shore.
"H. M. S. Hampshire was on her way
to Russia."
Accompanying Earl Kitchener and
his staff were Hugh James O'Beirne,
former councilor of the British em
bassy at Petrograd and former min
ister at Sofia: O. A. Fitzgerald, Earl
Kitchener's private military secretary:
Brigadier General Ellershaw and Sir
Frederick Donaldson.
Made War Lord in 1914.
Earl Kitchener was appointed sec
retary of state for war on Aug. 8, 1914,
a few days after Great Britain's dec
laration of war on- Germany. He was
regarded as Engand's greatest soldier
and the decision of the government to
entrust him with supreme direction of
the war was received by unanimous
approval.
As the war progressed and Great
Britain's deficiences in certain direc
tiohs, particularly in regard to th
shortage of artillery ammunition be
came apparent, Earl Kitchener was
subjected to severe criticism, led by
Lord Northecliffe. The secretary was
charged with responsibility for failure
to foresee the extraordinary demand
for heavy shells and as a result tie
ministry of munitions was formed with
David Llyod George at its head.
Kesponsibilities Lessened.
Earl Kitchener's responsibilities
were further lessened by the appoint
ment of Sir William Robertson as chief
of the imperial staff in December of
last year. It was reported at that timo
that friction had arisen between Earl
Kitchener and Field Marshal French,
the in command of the British forces
in France. Shortly after the appoint
ment of General Robertson, Field
Marshal French relinquished his com
mand. Notwithstanding the criticism
directed against Earl Kitchener, his
great accomplishments during the war
are recognized universally. Foremost
of his achievements was the creation
from England's untrained manhood of
a huge army. At the beginning of
the war, Great Britain had only a few
