HUGHES OR
ROOSEVELT?
Republican and Bull Moose Conven
tions On This Week Stanford
Sends Delegate to Latter.
The sole delegate that Lincoln
county will have at any of the na
tional conventions this week or next
left for Chicago Monday afternoon.
This was John N. Menefee, Jr., who
is a delegate-at-large from Kentucky
to the Progressive National Conven
tion, which meets at Chicago tomor
row, the same time that the Republi
can national convention is in session
Mr. Menefee will take quite a vaca
tion while away. From Chicago he
will go to several points in Oklaho
ma, Texas, and New Mexico, where
he has legal business.
The greatest interest is centering
in the Republican National conven
tion which convenes at Chicago to
morrow. Latest dispatches seem to
indicate that Justice Hughes, of the
Supreme Court will be the Republi
can nominee for president, if he can
prove satisfactory to the Bull
Moose and Roosevelt.
Mr. Menefee, who goes to the Bull
Moose gathering is an uncompromis
ing Roosevelt man all the time.
The Chicago Tribune, the leading
newspaper of Chicago and perhaps
the leading newspaper of the nation
says Tuesday that a coalition has
been formed against Hughes which
has grown to over 500 delegate
votes. It will assert that Cummins
and La Follette, with their delegates
have joined the movement which
commits the delegates to select, in j
lieu of Hughes, some one of the fa-. py what theh. customers may 9an

Thees two things were made em-
phatically clear Monday after there j
had been several gatherings of in
coming Progressive leaders and a
number of conferences had been held
in the headquarters of Chairman
George W. Perkins.
The unmistakable trend toward
Hughes in the lobbies and headquar
ters continues and for that reason
the explicit utterances from the Pro

valuable. Through some unaccount- j ,

TEDDY KOW FAVORITE.
. For the first time since the bet -
ting campaign on the nominations
for President by the Republican
party was opened in Wall street
the financial district baturday made
Theodore Roosevelt its favorite in
the money. One bet. of $5,000 even ,
on him was reported by one of the
betting commissioners on the curb,
who later said a flood of money was
ready to be let doose at 4 to 4 on
Roosevelt's chances. Mention was
made of $100,000 at those odds by
one banker. The same commissioner
reported a strange disappearance of
Hughes money, in evidence so abun
dantly earlier in the week. That
was attributed largely to the recent
utterancb by the Justice that no
man had been authorised to act for
him in respect to any nomination
for President. Odds against the
compromise candidates remained un
changed, supporters of Fairbanks de
manding 15 to 1 against their choice,
with 8 to 1 being the best offered,

At the Alkahest Chautauqua this

hearing Mr. Alton Packard, one of the
greatest humorists and crayon artists
, the world has ever produced.
Mr. Packard is a veritable genius of
laughter. He is the original and only
genuine and instantaneous cure for the
grouch. If you are bothered with that
ALTON PACKARD.
affliction take it to the Chautauqua,
and when you return to your home you
1 will not only be cured, but will not re
member that there is such a thing as a
grouch.
Packard's crayon work is rapid al
most beyond belief, and his comments
as he works, as well as some of his
pictures, are simply irresistible. There
is nothing that does more good tban a
good, hearty laugh, and enough of that
tonic will make doctors' bills and
drugs almost unknown. Let the whole
city turn out in a body and hear Pack
ard and lay in a supply of mirth that
will last indefinitely.
Bilious Attacks
When you have a bilious attack
your liver fails to perform its funct
ions. You become constipated. The
food you eat ferments in your stom
ach instead of digesting. This in
flames the stomach and causes
nausea, vomiting and a terrible head
ache. Take Chamberlain's Tablets.
They will tone up your liver, clean
out your stomach and you will soon
be as well as ever. They only cost
a quarter. Obtainable everywhere.

Latest War News
German and British battle fleets
have clashed in what appears to have
been the greatest naval battle in
history.
According to Berlin the sea fight
resulted disastrously for the British
who lost one of their -latest dread
naughts, two battle cruisers, two ar
mored cruisers and numerous smaller
craft, while a large number of British
battleships were damaged.
The Germans admit only the lost
of one battleship and a small cruiser,
while the fate of one cruiser and of
some torpedo boats is unknown.
The British admiralty announces
that a battle occurred in the North
Sea between the British and German
fleets, in the course of which a num
ber of German and English ships were
sunk.
The British battle cruisers Queen
Mary and Indefatigable and the
battleship Invincible were sunk and
cruiser Warrior was disabled. The
German losses are described as ser
ious by the English report.
The announcement says two Ger
man battle cruisers were sunk and
two German light cruisers were dis
abled and probably sunk.
The British destroyers Tipperary,
Turbulent, Fortune, Sparrowhawk
and Ardent were lost and six others
have not yet been accpunted for, says
London. The admiralty announce
ment says no British battleships nor
light cruisers were sunk.
The battle occured off the coast!
of Jutland. The English admiralty
announcement says the German fleet
avoided the main British forces and
returned to port severely damaged.
Accoiding to Berlin the British
dreadnaught sunk was the Warspite
of the Queen Elizabeth class, a 27,
000-ton vessel, and the battle cruisers
Queen Mary and Indefatigable were
sunk. The British battleship Marl
borough is reported to have been hit
by a torpedo.
German warships rescued parts of
the crews of the sunken British sea
fighters says Berlin. It is declared
that only two of the crew of the
battle -cruiser. Indefatigable were
iaTed V f-irl' '
The engagementtook place during
the afternoon of May 31, and it con
tinued during the night. The Ger
man fleet apparently put out from
the Baltic and encountered the Brit
ish between Skagerak and Horn's
Riff in the North Sea. The Germans
returned to their home base June 1,
according-to the German statement.
Further progress has been made on
the Verdun front in the Vaux sec
tion, according to Berlin, and
French counter attacks have been
repulsed.
Revised reports concerning the
great North Sea battle show that the
British and the Germans each lost
a total of fifteen war craft, but that
the British losses were greater in
tonnage. These reports cause the
British public to believe that the en
gagement was not so near a defeat
as first appeared, and that suprem
acy is still held by a safe margin.
On one fact, whether the Germans
engaged the main British fleet, the
reports contradict each other flatly,
Berlin claiming that the enemy's
grand fleet was in action and Lon
don denying it. About 4,000 Brit
ish seamen went down with their ves
sels. MISS NOE'S FINE WORK.
The Cincinnati Times-Star had the
following of the work of Miss Emma
Noe, who visits Miss Berta Jean
Penny here frequently, in the Cin
cinnati May Music festival. "Act
third from Meyerbeer's 'L' Afri
caine' was undeniably the most suc
cessful and the most correct of the
three scenes presented. Miss Emma
Noe, as 'Selika,' made a veritable sen
sation. Miss Noe began as a mezzo,
but with the characteristic uncertain
ty which attends so many young
American voices, has developed into
a real dramatic soprano with a splen
did register and an actual dramatic
talent. Her extremely beautiful
voice was admirably suited to her
role, her rapid advancement artis

sang 'Amneris,' almost incredible."

Citizens Appear Before City Coun

to Accrue to People.
A good-sized delegation of resi
dents of the northern secton of the
city, appeared before the City Coun
cil at its regular meeting last Thurs
day night and petitioned for the
opening of Portman avenue clear
through from Lancaster to Danville
avenues. It was shown that more
than 75 school children live north of
the railroad and have to cross it
twice a day to get to school, who
would be directly saved from such
I attendant dangers by the opening of
the street. But three propery own
ers are affected by the proposition, it
is said, and those who are behind
the movement, say that the opening
of the street will greatly benefit the
property owners on the street, open
up a number of valuable and salable
building lots as well as prove a bene
fit to the community as a whole and
a progressive move on the part of
the city. It is reported that two of
the property owners affected have of
