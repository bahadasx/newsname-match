THE I. N. G. CAMP
PLANSJM DOUBT
Uncertain Whether Summer En­
campment will be for Ten er
Fifteen Days.
Register and Leader: Plans for
the summer camps of the regiments
of the Iowa national guard are be
ing held up owing to doubt whether
the war department will require ten
or fifteen day camps.
Under the old law the national
guard held ten day camps. The new
military bill which becomes effect
ive July 1 provides for fifteen day
encampments. Adj. Gen. Guy E. Lo
gan yesterday wired the authorities
at Washington asking whether the
fifteen day camp will be necessary
for 1916.
The department answer was In
definite. It stated that It has not
been determined whether the camp
rule shall become effective for this
year.
Camps will be held, but doubt as
to the number of days to be devoted
to maneuvers will prevent the Iowa
department making definite plans
until after July 1. Only the present
organized force will go to camp this
year. The new military law pro
vides for increasing the guard in this
state from 3,400 to 10,400 men. The
new organizations will not have ma
neuver camps until 1917.
The plan for Iowa is to hold regi
mental camps. The places have not
been selected. It is probable that
the Third infantry will come to Des
Moines. The Second infantry will
probably camp at Webster City.
The fifteen day camps will in
crease the cost of maneuvers one
third. Adjutant General Logan says
that the state of Iowa is ready to
meet its share of the additional ex
pense.
Camps of instruction will be held
at Camp Dodge for infantry officers,
from June 26 to £9.

SER-
VICE IS VERY FINE
large Audience Greets Program Giv­
en at the St. Paul Lutheran
Church.
St. Paul's Lutheran church was
packed to the doors Sunday evening
with an audience gathered to hear
the splendid program of psalm and
song arranged for the purpose of
dedicating the new altar, pulpit and
statue of Christ recently installed.
The altar, pulpit and baptismal
fount are in white enamel with gold
leaf trimmings and are of exquisite
purity and beauty. The statute of
Christ was wrought by Tliorwalsen,
a Norwegian sculptor. It is about
four feet in height and of unusual
beauty.
The pulpit and altar were hand
somely decorated with floral arrange
ments of snowballs, roses, carna
tions, ferns and pansics, the electri
cal lighting being very effectively
placed. Two handsome candlesticks
which go on the altar have not yet
arrived, but will be placed in posi
tion within a week or so.
The musical program was of the
usually fine quality furnished by the
talent in the German Lutheran
church and consisted of solos, duets
and choruses, one of the most beau
tiful choruses being "The Calm on
Galilee," by Porter. The offertory,
Andante in by Batiste, played by
the church organist, Miss Louise
Blankenbueliler, was so beautifully
rendered as to be worthy of espec
ial mention. Psalms were given by
tlie children of the church in excel
lent manner and the entire program
was one of enjoyment. The annual
song services by the choir of the
German Lutheran church are greet
ed with appreciative audiences to en
joy the music of the congregation's
singers, under the efficient leader
ship of the pastor, Rev. Henry A.
Koenig.

INDEX FINGER
IS AMPUTATED
C. H. Crawford Has Serious Accident
at Sieve Factory With Press­
ing Machine.
C. H. Crawford sustained an un
fortunate accident a few-days ago at
the Closz & Howard sieve factory
when lit had the index finger of his
right hand taken off in a pressing
machine. He was just starting the
metal though the machine and in
tended putting his whole hand in
for some reason, when the index
finger was chopped off just below the
first joint. The attending surgeon
found it necessary to remove a little
more of the bone and amputated it
just above the second or knuckle
joint.
Mr. Crawford has suffered Intense
ly but today is resting more easily,
being very thankful that the entire
hand was not the subject of injury.
It will probably be six weeks before
Mr. Crawford will be able to be
about his usual work at the sieve
factory.
ANOTHER BIG DEAL
CLOSED IN CITY
E. M. Martin Buys Business Houses
and Lots on East Second
Street.
Another important business deal
was closcd Friday whereby E. H.
Martin comes into possession of the
Daniels building on east Second
street, 'owned by N. V. and James
Daniels and at present occupicd by
the Stark Auto company, also the lot
now occupied by the small frame
barber shop occupied by Stowe
Zicglcr which adjoins the Daniels
building. The consideration for the
Daniels building was $5,000 and for
the adjoining lot, which was pur
chased of J. L. Karnrar, $3,500.
For the present there will be no
change in occupancy, but in the fut
ure Mr. Martin has in mind the erec
tion of a brick addition to the Dan
iels building, making the whole in
to one big opera house or auditor
ium for which there is great need in
Webster City—especially in view of
the fact that the armory opera house
will no doubt soon be used almost
exclusively by Company if we are
to retain this militia company here.
This news will be received with
approval by all business men and
especially those of this cast business
block who have in the past two yearn
witnessed an unprecendented im
provement in the quality of business
houses which have been erected
there.
WEBSTER CITY, IOWA, TUESDAY, JUNE 6, 1916.
PREPAREDNESS AT HOME.
01 ESCAPE
Big Jeffries Seven Passenger Auto
mobile Crashes Through Rail-
ing of Illinois Central
^Viaduct.
CAB WAS OCCUPIED BY THBEE
Authorities Should Erect a Dan
ger Sign, Warning Drivers to
Proceed Carefully.
A horrible accident was again
narrowly averted Sunday after
noon about three o'clock when a big
Jeffries seven passenger car driven
by a Fort Dodge butcher, with his
wife and child, crashed into the rail
ing of the west viaduct over the Il
linois Central railroad and the front
axle of the machine, breaking
through the board railing, hung en
tirely clear of the bridge.
The woman occupant of the car
was cut and bruised by the broken
glass from the windshield, but none
of the occupants were thrown from
the machine and were otherwise un
injured. Passersby during the af
tcrnoon, gazing at the wrecked car
hanging perilously out over the rail
road track twenty to twenty-five feet
below, shuddered as they thought ot
the fearful death the car's occupants
might have ^iad.
The car was towed into town to a
garage and fixed up sufficiently for
the owner to drive home next morn
ing. The frame, front axle and
fender were bent, headlights broken
and minor breakages sustained by
the machine. This is the sixth or
eighth accident to carriages or cars
on the high bridge or viaduct over
the railroad in the west portion of
the city and should be a warning to
other drivers to go over the bridge
with more caution than that usually
exercised. Coming into this city
from the west, a driver has no warn
ing of the sharp turn and the ex
tremely high incline he approaches,
and generally takes the turn on high
gear, running the risk of losing con
trol of his machine just at the crit
ical moment, before he reaches the
middle of the bridge. There is now
another road into the city from the
west, running west and south of the
National Sewer Pipe factory, but
strangers entering the city are not
aware of this and generally take the
main travelled road over the high
bridge.
There should be a danger sign
erected in a conspicuous place just
before the approach of the viaduct
from the west. There is not a more
hazardous drive in this vicinity for
drivers who are not acquainted with
the roads.

MRS. MATTIE GRANT
CALLED BY DEATH
Came to Webster City Forty-Three
Years Ago—Victim of
Bright's Disease.
Mrs. Mattie Grant died at her
homo on east Bank street shortly-af
ter 12 o'clock Friday night, her
death being caused by Bright's dis
ease. She had been in very poor
healtli for a long time and during
the pa3t six weeks had been serious
ly ill.
Mrs. Grant came to WebBter City
forty-three years ago and had made
her home here continuously since
She was about sixty-four years of age
and was born in Galena, 111. The de
ceased leaves one son—W. S. Nor
ton—a well known resident of this
city.
The funeral was held at the

REV. SHOOK FOR
MALLYJNSTALLED
Good Audience at Universalis!
Church—Fine Music—Stirring
Address.
A good audience was present Fri
day night at the Universalist church
for the formal installation service of
Rev. H. F. Shook as pastor of the lo
cal church. Three very fine musical
numbers were given by members of
the Universalist quartet, the last
number being accompanied by a vio
lin obligato by J. C. Jenkinson.
The address by Dr. B. G. Carpen
ter of Peoria, III., was then given In
masterly style, and was a thought
ful expoiient of his views of the lib
eral church. Liberality, however, as
interpreted by Dr. Carpenter, does
not mean non-church membership
Everyone should have affiliation with
some church, for the speaker regards
the non-performance of this duty as
an act of pure laziness. Dr. Carpen
ter has excellent delivery and is a
trained thinker whom it is a pleas
ure to hear upon the platform.
E. P. Prince, as moderator of the
congregation, then delivered a greet
ing from the congregation to the new
pastor, speaking from the standpoint
of the ideal layman. The response
by Rev. Harry Shook was excellent
ly given. The entire service was, of
much interest and pleasure for all
present.

SCOUTS LEME FOR
F1RMYS MRP
Eight Cars Filled with Forty Boys
With Their Scoutmaster go to
Bell's Mill.
Yesterlay morning at precisely 9
o'clock, forty Boy Scouts, together
with their scoutmaster, Murray Mc
Murray, left town for their last
year's camping site noar Bell's mill,
twelve miles south of this city, where
they will enjoy a four day's camp.
Closz & Howard's big auto truck left
the city earlier for the camping spot,
loaded with tents, provisions, etc.
The forty boys were conveyed to
the place with drivers and eight au
tomobiles offered for the occasion,
and before leaving the city, tliey
made a tour of the business district
in procession with their standards
and flags flying.
Chas. II. Comley has charge of the
cuisine of the camp and good "eats"
are thus insured the youngsters. The
boys will be under camp rule from
the moment of arrival at the camp
ing site and any infraction of the
rules is to be punished at once.
Swimming will be indulged in
twice a day between certain hours.
At those times, the scoutmaster will
sit upon shore with rope and other
life saving apparatus close at hand
to guard against possible accident.
Any boy going into the water out
side of regulation hours will be re
quired to at once "hoof it" for Web
ster City, so if any mother beholds
her young hopeful trudging in, trav
el stained and weary before the ex
piration of four days, it is probable
that his journey on foot was an en
forced one and that he disregarded
the time honored rule of—
"Hang you clothes on a hickory
limb,
But don't go near_£25Wjatfer."
Thtr went••xiT-tSfe is gtven I
at 'camping time by the scoutmaster,
who in turn expects and demands
absolute obedience to his rules. This
is the third year of camp life for the
scouts, who look forward with great
joy from one summer to the next for
the few days of camping.
Many Improvements.
The Mrs. F. R. and Jesse W. Ma
son home on west Sec6nd street is
undergoing improvements which will
change its appearance very much.
The residence has been raised and a
new foundation put under the good
sized addition which is being built.
A large porch is being erected on the
east and a fine sleeping porch wiil
be made over the kitchen at the
rear of the residence. When these
improvements are finished the house
will be repainted.
Healy for Cummins.
Robert Hcaly of Fort Dodge, who
tried to stampede the republican con
vention at Cedar Rapids for Colonel
Roosevelt, will follow his Instruc
tions and vote for Senator Cummins
for the presidential nomination on
the early ballots, he said in Chicago
yesterday.
If he considers Cummins out ot
the race, he will then vote for Roose
velt.
