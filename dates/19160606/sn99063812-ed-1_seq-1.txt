HOUSES OETROYEO IN
EARLY MORNING FIRE
Eicypt for Kovernl years, and In his op
erations with the Egyptian troops ho
was stcndlly promoted, and was given
several knighthood orders by the
crown und by tbo Egyptian khedlve.
As Sldar, he commanded the British-
EiryiIanforcc n 189$, recovering Doa
Roln for Eio'Pt. nnd ho was made a
major general. For crushing the
power or tho Khnllfa two years later
he was raised to tho peerage as Baron
of Khartoum, thanked by parliament,
nnd made governor general of Egyp
tian Soudan.
doing to South Africa tbo following
year, he rendered Invaluable assist
ance to Lord Roberts as his chref of
staff. When Roberts was called home
to become commander In chief. Kitch
ener succeeded him oh commander of
South Africnn operations, and carried
nit tho campaign to a successful con
clusion. For this, ho was again raised
In tho peerage, and appointed com
mander In chief of India.
With the oubrcok of the present war,
Kitchener was made secretary of state
for war, and as a result of his active
work both In this capacity and as a
Held marshal, In preparing tho raw re
cruits for service, he was made an
earl. As is always the case in such
a crisis, there have been, frequent criti
cisms of Kitchener from British
sources, at times amountjng to de
mands ror nts removal rrom omce.
Kitchener was a campaigner, not a
"parade soldier." Ho pursued the
course he deemed best, caring not a
whit what the people thought of It. He
has always been a wonderfully
shrewd calculating military machine,
and while It cannot be said tbat ho
was universally loved through the Brit
ish empire, he was universally respect
ed. He dealt with the public as with
an army, and though the people railed
nnd cursed him, they appreciated, nev
ertheless, tho fact that he was making
n thorough Job of tbe affair be bad
been naked to arrange In the same way
that be made bla military successes.

court, directing the city oSclalls lo
cal 1 a special election on tbe recall

ed the Introduction of' tbe ordinance
already prepared,, calling the special
election. l
"I move that the ordinance' be tabled

a very vital question there aa to the
petition being legal."

"It's Uke this," said Struble. "The
court has ordered us to take action or
show cause why., I understand this
proceeding has all been regularly aad
according to. state law, and Leant sew
how any of us can sidestep. I want

to tbe election; tbat the court i has the
power to order the council to call an
election or show cause, as It has' done.
