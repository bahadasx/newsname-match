MADE TO HEAD IT OFF
Next Move Is To Get Progres

. Boosting T. R., For Which
Conference Is Now On
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CHICAGO. June 5. Representatives
of the several candidates for the Re
publican nomination are in a perplex
ing predicament tonight. Having fos
Jered sentiment In favor of Justice
Hughes until they feel sure the Colo
nel was definitely eliminated, they
now fear they cannot control the
Hughes movement.
During ten day it grew to the pro
portions of a boom. Efforts are being
made to turn all elements against it
and the Indications are that the veto
of the Progressive party, which, of
course, means Colonel Roosevelt's dis
approval of Hughes, may be sought, as
check. -
Harmony Imperative
Harmony above everything else is
any nominee would answer the pur- j
pose because it te recognized that on-1
less the Republicans" and Progressives I
get together . their chance of success
at the polls is very slim. TheRepub
lican leaders are willing to concede to
Colonel Roosevelt the veto in some
form. Some of. t'ie leaders ' say lie
should be willing to select one or two
men who will be acceptable to him
from the list of candidates in the field
Others "ihink he should suggest men
for consideration by convention lead
ers and practically all the party con
ferees are willing to admit that any of
the candidates definitely rejected by
Mr. Roosevelt eould not be nominated
Impartial observers within the Re
publican ranks do not consider that
the unexpected growth of the Hughes
boom is necessarily an indiaction of
personal popularity-of the justice a
niong the delegates. Those who pro
moted It in opposition to what proved
to be an exaggerated demand 'for the
nomination of Roosevelt' were surpris
ed at its growth. The individual can
didates were working in harmony in
dependently and therefore there was
no canvass of the extent to which
Hughes was the second choice of their
supporters. This was found to be far
more general than .had been anticipat
ed. Hughes Everywhere
With the arrival of hundreds of del
egates today the sentiment in faVor
of Hughes reached high tide and In
spite of the opposition forces he ap
pears to be far in the lead. Managers
of the "favorite son" candidates have
made no headway to combine against
Hughes because he is the second
choice of many of the instructed dele
gates and trading being done. Unless
the situation changes very soon, these
delegates are almost certain to "flop"
AH thought of getting a pre-conven-tion
'-statement from Justice Hughes
was abandoned during the day. The
so-called "smoking out" processes
were unavailing.
It was not believed that any of these
demands would be met. Many of the
Roosevelt adherents believed the Colo
nel should come to Chicago. His pres
ence, they say, would obviate all Pro
gressives from getting beyond control.
Strangely enough the old guard lead
ers would welcome Mr. Roosevelt at
this time as they would prefer to deal
directly rather than through others.
Bull Moose Confer
Efforts of the Progressive national
committee today to fix a time for nom
inations in their convention resulted
in conflicting statements of what act
ually had been agreed on. After the
Progressive national committee had
held its conference and the leaders
had been urged to exert every effort
to Jiold the delegates in check until
late in the week, intermediaries be
tween Republican and Progressive
headquarters began to operate. The
result of several preliminary confer
ences brought Senator Lodge and Mr. !
Perkins together. Senator Lodge was j
told that Mr. Perkins wished to confer!
'with him on possibilities for harmony.
Harmony Sought
When Senator Lodge went Into the
conference it was admitted that the
purpose was to discuss convention
plans in an effort to reach some agree
ment to avert another third party tic

While it has stated authori

withdraw until Mexican troops
have shown ability to prevent
the raids, there are many other
questions raised by the note

that the I'nited States define
its attitude toward Mexico has
received muc'i consideration in

The demand may be ignored
