TAKE THE "E
AU of the staff and line officers
of the Fourth Iufaiitrv took their
examinations on Sunday for com
missions, and judging from the
smiles around it is taken for grant
ed that all were satisfied with the
results. As a rule the examina
tions began at or about 9:30 in the
morning and concluded around 3
or 4 in the afternoon, the men
taking lunch at the examination
places or going without.
Colonel Broadber.t conducted
the examination of staff officers in
Lihue, and Major Rice looked af
ter the officers of the first battali
on at the county building Lt. Colo
nel Tinimons took the officers of
the two companies at Kealia and
Major McBrvde the officers a t
Homestead and Eleele. Major Bal
dwin "put through" the officers
of Makaweli and Waimea.
The examination paoers came
in big. sealed envelopes from head
quarters at Honolulu and were not
opened until work was underway.
These papers were hard or easy
according to the number of even
ings the officer had put in in study
ing tactics. Inasmuch as the local
regiment is new. however, and
the work is not very well advanc
ed some of the officers seemed to
feel that the examination was rath
er stiff for one day, or onesitling.
vfhe examination papers will
"not be passed upon here, but will
be forwarded to the board at Ho
nolulu. Presumably any officer failing
to make the required 75 per cent
will take' another examination lat
er on. The department was very
anxious that all of the officers
"take a stab" at it now, even if
they iailed; on account of the de
sirability of having all the com
panies officered by duly commis
sioned men at the first of July,
when the new army bill goes into
effect if that were possible.
New Drill Sergeant
Sergeant Gibson, 2nd. Infantry,
U. S. A., arrived at Lihue Wed
nesday morning and reported to
Colonel Broadbent. He will be
come di ill instructor of the men
of the Fourth Infantry. Sergeant
Gibson has been in the military
service fourteen years. He came
fronis El Paso, Texas, to Fort
Shafter, at Honolulu, only last
November, so is comparatively
new in the Islands. He has al
ready entered actively upon his
duties.
An Engagement
Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Werner, of
flanalei, have announced the en
gagement of their daughter, Eliza
beth Waioli Waakikeoniookalani,

Honolulu. The wedding will take

Changes Of Teachers

XAMS
IAN5 HAVE
A
The annual meeting of the Ka
uai Historical Society was held on
Wednesday evening at the Lihue
Library rooms, and was quite up
to the high level of that organiza
tion in interest and ability. The
secretory, Miss Elsie Wilcox, read
an interesting interview of Cel.
de la Vergne, reported by Mr.
Lydgate, descrptive of his first
visit to Kauai in 1872, and detail
ing in a pleasant way the condi
tions of life and society in those
old davs. The tribute to the climate
in his opinion, without excep
tion the finest in the world, de
serves to be set in gold by the
Hawaii Promotion Committee.
Mr. Lydgate read a paper on
the Mahaulepu Hut, which told
the story of that Hawaiian syndi
cate, and set forth in a clear light
the strange point of view, and
some other peculiar practices of
the Hawaiian Hui. It was an in
teresting contribution to the his
tory of that strange and anomal
ous creation, the Hawaiian Hui.
Mr. W. Hyde Rice submitted
an interesting legend of a sacred
spear point, in the hands of a
famous ancient chief, who accom
plished great things with it, in a
sort of Don Quixote tour of the
Islauds.lt was a legendary tale of
rather novel relations.
Mr. S. W. Wilcox gave several
very interesting, and graphic in
cidents from his experiences as
sheriff of the island, relative main
ly to buried treasure, and the theft
of the same. From his account it
would seem that a great deal more
has been buried than has ever been
satisfactorily accounted for, and
that there ought to be large, if
somewhat vague, possibilities of
treasure trove for the men with
the right kind of insight and the
proper touch. Mr. Wilcox capped
the climax of his spell as a raccon-
teur by his tale 'Who stole Lima-
loa's Awa?" a stirring story of ad
venture and detective interest.
The treasurer's report showed
a balance in the treasury of gl9.
The same officers were re-elected,
viz: Win. Hyde Rice, Pres.; J. M.
Lvdgate, Vice Pres., Elsie H.
Wilcox, Sec.-Treas.
Death Of Old Lady

Kealia thirty-five years and was
quite well known in the Portu

its failure to re appoint Mr. and
Mrs. H. C. Brown to a school on
this island. Mr, and Mrs. Brown
are principal and assistant in the

found that they had not been re
appointed the assumption was that

nolulu or some other island, but
such has been found not to be the
case.

PLANTATIONS
CHILDREN'S DAY
Al LIHUE
Last Sunday was observed at
Child reus Day at the Lihue Union
Church, very much to the iutercit
and enjoyment of all concrrntd.
not forgetting the children them
selves. The program was varitd
and original, such as muit appeal
to all lovers of children, and the
selections were more than usually
bright and interesting. The very
small children, with their concert
recitation of Two Little Hands,
and their representation of local
wild flowers, quite captivated the
audience b v their unconscious
grace end naivete.
A novel and very successful fea
ture of the service was the Recita
tion Tableaux, representing the
Parable of the Pharisee and the
Publican, and of the talents, in
character and costume, and of the
Ten Commandments, representing
the two tablets, with a child, at
tired suitibly in white, for each
Commandment.
In a very brief address Mr. Lyd
gate emphasized the importance of
bringing up children in tne nur
ture and admonition of the Lord.
The church was beautifully dec
orated for the occasion, a novel
feature of the decorations being a
number of cinarv bird;, hidden in
the foliage, which sang most joy
ously from time to time during
the service.
COMMUNICATIONS
The following was received on
Saturday from one of the teacher
of the Waimea school;
Waimea, Kauai.
June 2, 161$.
Editor Garden Island:
Understanding that one of the
reasons, given to the Department
of Public Instruction, for thenon
reappointment of Mr. H. C Brown
as principal and Mrs. Brown as
assistant at Waimea. was the state
ment that "all the teachers with
the possible exception of two,
would be glad to see them leave,"
seven of the other ten teachers
signed the following petitiou
gotten up without the kuowlcdgc
of the Browns.
Quite possibly 'ther statements
made to the Board contained an
equal amount of truth.
One of the teachers.
PETITION.
The report having been circulat
ed that all the teachers of the
Waimea school were opposed to
the continuation of the services of
Mr. and Mrs. Brown in our school,
we wish to denv such a report and
express our sincere desire that
they be retained as our principal
and vice principal.
