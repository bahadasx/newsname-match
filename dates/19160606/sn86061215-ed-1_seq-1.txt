PRIDE OF THE NAVY

Kaiser's People Continue
to Celebrate Battle as
Complete Victory
London, June 5. —British officers of
the fleet which participated in the Jut
land battle and have returned here
identify the two German warships
sunk as the Hindenburg and the Lut-
BOW.
The latest reports received by the
British admiralty enabled the Asso
ciated PreBs to give the following re
view of the naval engagement off the'
Jutland coast with various incidents
and results, as viewed from the Brit
ish side:
"During the night of May 31—June 1
/British destroyers made a determined
attack on the retreating German battle
fleet which hastened its flight. The
British fleet remained in possession of
the scene of battle during the morning
of July 1 and traversed the field four
times, finding no enemy to fire upon.
The commander in chief took his fleet
back to its bases at his leisure and five
hours after its arrival, reported the
battle fleet ready for action.
Losses Concealed.
As regards the German losses, defin
lte evidence, it is declared, has now
been obtained that they were deliber
ately falsified and that the following
were destroyed:
Two battle cruisers one at least,
and probably two battleships four
light cruisers eight destroyers and
one submarine.
The remainder of the German battle
cruiser squadron may have reached
home ports but the ships were all
severely damaged as also were ships
of the Koenlg class, which came under
the fire of a portion of the British bat
tle fleet.
Besides the above, the Associated
Press has obtained information from
returned officers of the fleet that they
are able to identify the lost German
battle cruisers as the Hindenburg and
the Lutzow. Naval officials here point
out that on account of their proximity
to home ports some of the German ves
sels which were badly injured as was
the British cruiser Warrior, would
have been able to make port.
The German warship Hindenburg
has hitherto been classified as a bat
tleship.
German Losses Heavy
London, June 5.—German sailors
rescued by Scandinavian steamers de
scribed the Teutonic losses in the Jut
land battle as colossal, according to
Copenhagen dispatch to the Tele
graph Exchange Co. A large number
of the cruiser Weisbaden and men
from several German torpedo boats
have been rescued and brought to
Copenhagen. They report that many
of their oomrades, after floating for
thirty-six hours s* rafts without food
or water, drank sea water, became in
sane and jumped Into the ocean.
The German survivors say that sev
eral of their torpedo boats and sub
marines were capsized by the British
ihells and sunk instantly. Bodies of
both British and German sailors are
beginning to be washed ashore on
the coast of Jutland.
Captains of steamers arriving in
Scandinavian harbors report that the'
big German cruisero which were op
erating along the Courland coast near
Riga, have been withdrawn and that
a large squadron of destroyers which
bad been patrolling the southern Bal
tic was not sighted last week.
Germans Give Account
Berlin, June 5.—An authoritative
-»account of the North sea issued today
gives the flrst detailed picture of the
great engagement between the Ger
rtl man high sea fleet and that of the
Hibrltish. Many details of the engage
ment are suppressed for stratgetical
reasons. The article however, meets
clearly what is characterized as the
u" British attempt to explain defeat by
the statement that the German sea
forces in the action were much larger
than those which the British were able
to bring into play.
This account declares explicity that
twenty-six of Admiral Jellicoe's most
powerful battleships, including six of
the most modern Queen Elizabeth
class and the entire British flying
composed of battle cruisers
armor
en-
/gaged
in all but the early stages of the
day battle. The fleet thus assembled
surpassed in tonnage and weight of
broadsides the German force engaged,

SURVIVOR GIVES
OF GREAT BUTTLE
SEA TURNED INTO CALDRON AND
WATER BECOMES STIFF WITH
DEAD FISH.
Edinburgh, June —Survivors arriv
ing here from British destroyers which
made a massed attack on a German
battleship in the Jutland battle are
convinced they sent to the bottom the
dreadnaught Hindenburg, the pride of
the German navy.
These sailors say that the Hinden
burg was struck successively by four
torpedoes while the destroyers dashed
in alongside of her hull tearing her to
pieces until the mighty ship reeled and
sank. An officer from one of the, des
troyers gave the following graphic ac
count of the battle:
"The ships of the grand fleet went
into action as If they were going into
maneuvers. From every yardarm the
white ensign flew, the flag which is to
the sailor as the tattered colors were
in days of old to a hard pressed regi
ment. That It went hard with the bat
tle cruisers is apparent but one ship
can not fight a dozen. They had fought
a great fight, a fight to be proud of, a
fight which will live longer than many
a victory.
Tit For Tat
"We fought close into the foe and if
anything is certain in the uncertainties
of naval battles it is that we gave at
least as good as we got. We passed
along the line of German ships some
miles away and let off broadside after
broadside. The air was heavy with
masses of smoke, black, yellow, green
and every other color, which drifted
slowly between the opposing lines hid
ing sometimes friend and foe. The
enemy ships were firing very fast but
watching the ships in front one came
to the conclusion that the shooting
was decidedly erratic. Again and again
salvos of shells fell short of the mark
to be followed immediately by others
which soreamed past in the air.
Shells Cause Geysers.
"I watched the Iron Duke swinging
through the seas letting off broadside
after broadside, wicked tongues of
flame leaping through clouds of smoke.
The din of battle was stunning, stupen
dous, deafening, as hundreds of the
heaviest guns in the world roared out
at once. Great masses of water rose in
the air like waterspouts, reaching as
high as the masts as the salvos of Qer
man shells fell short or went over
their target. Now and then a shell
found Its mark but it left me absolute
ly cold as its effect on each man at a
time like this. A dozen men may be
knocked out at one's side. It makes no
difference. It was impossible to see
what was happening among the ships
of the foe. The smoke obscured every
thing so effeotually that one could only
get a glimpse at intervals when a kind
ly wind blew a lane through the pall.
It was apparent that the best ships of
the enemy were engaged but how many
neither eye nor glass could make out.
The number was certainly large. It
was equally impossible to see what
damage we were causing. Only the
high command knew the progress of
the battle. That the damage inflicted
on the German ships was great does
not admit of any doubt. At one time
two vessels red with fire gleamed
through the smoke.
Lion Missing For a Time.
"It is a curious feeling to be in the
midst of a battle and not to know to
which side fortune leans. Where only
a few ships are engaged it is different.
Our own losses were known with some
degree of exactness but even that was
uncertain. Thus at one time it was
thought that the Lion had been lost as
she did not answer any call. It trans
pired that her wireless had been des
troyed.
"With the dusk came the great op
portunity of the mosquito craft and
both, sides made use of it tothe full.
It was in this way that one or the sad
dest of many sad incidents occurred.
A destroyer, true to its name, dashed
for the big enemy ship. She soon got
into effective range and loosed her tor
pedo and with deadly efTect on a Ger
man battleship. The ship went down
and the destroyer raced for safety, the
commander and officer standing on the
bridge indulging in mutual congratula
tions at their success. At that moment
a shell hit the bridge and wiped out
the entire group.
Fish Cover Water.
"It was curious to note the effect of
the fight on the sea. Calm at the be
ginning, the water soon looked as If it
were under the influence of a gale so
great was the turmoil caused by the
leviathan ships plowing at terrific
speed through the waves. The sea also
seemed to be stiff with fish killed by
the shells bursting in the water.'

No One Seems to Have Any
Definite Idea as to Who
Will Be Nominated
VARIOUS FACTIONS
PULLING STRINGS
Hughes and Roosevelt Seem
Oftenest on Tongues
of the Prophets
Chicago, June 6.—The prog res
tive national committee today de
cided to withhold nominating a
candidate In the progressive con
vention until next Saturday, await
ing the action of the republican
committee.
Chicago, June 6.—The movement
for the nomination of Justloe
Hughes today took on the aspect
of a genuine boom.
Arriving delegations brought
evidences of sentiment In favor of
the Jurist and men who have
been Identified with the "old
guard" of fhe republican party
declared that many delegates In
structed for others were ready to
turn their votes to him after th'e
first ballot
On every hand explanations are
sought of the failure of sentiment
for Col. Roosevelt to crystallise. A
week age those who oppoeed the
nomination of Rooeevelt were
fearful of a stampede to him but
now it Is said that Is impossible.
Many cannot understand what
brought this change.
Chicago, June 6.—Uncertainty and
restraint were dominant factors here
today, forty-eight hours before the
gavels- were scheduled to fall at the
coliseum and the auditorium for the
opening of the republican and progres
sive national conventions.
The republican pre-conventlon drift
and swell of rumor, semi-official report
and pure gossip rolled from Hughes
and Roosevelt andt back to Hughes
then into the more quiet eddies of
favorite sondom only to break in far
flung spray and evaporate. From hour
to hour this movement went on while
nothing seemed to crystallise Into
tangibility.
"If we can hold our crowd back until
Friday or Saturday," remarked one
adroit manager of a lesser republican
candidate, 'we stand a mighty good
show. Let these big fellows go In
front and set the pacq. for the first
laps. We will begin to use gasoline
when these fellows have gone into the
fence, or to the pits for repairs.
After Best Man.
"It is not a case, as so many seem
to think, of any man to beat Wilson,
but it is a case of the best man to re
unite the republican party. That is
the issue upon which this nomination
finally will be settled."
This was much the situation as the
latest influx of delegates, alternates
and camp followers took place during
the hours up to noon.
If there was one man among the
straw hatted, cigar smoking thousands
that thronged into some twenty-five
odd acres of hotel lobbies and corri
dors, who had a definite idea of what
would happen during the next two or
three days in connection with the all
absorbing question of a nominee—that
man was as elusive as the one sought
by Diogenes.
Talking without a full knowledge of
the mood of uninstructed delegates, a
number of leaders declared emphat
ically that Roosevelt was out of the
race that Hughes was strong but
might slump within twenty-four hours
unless he came forth with a pro
nouncement of his stand, and, finally
that nothing short of several ballots
would begin to tell the story.
Compromise Possible.
There was a noticeable lack, as con
trasted with 1912, of incisiveness and
square jawed determination among the
major leaders. Everywhere, there was
apparent a disposition to go slowly
today and, as far as possible, let the
situation work out itself for a time,
at least. It was Indicated that prob
ably it would be late afternoon or
night before any action of any import
ance would be the result.
Meantime an alert, quiet counting of
noses of incoming delegations was
taking place, while various managers
spread out their subordinates and
assistants in dragnet fashion in en
deavors to find, if possible, the point
at which might occur the first sharp,
clear break toward one candidate.
Plans and counter planB for precipi
tating such a break have been evolved,
with studious care and In two or three
instances men counted wise in politi
cal stagecraft have already assembled
certain bits of stage paraphernalia
ready for use In event of propiti
ous opportunity.

MEETING OF IOWA DELEGATION
BUBBLES OVER WITH ENTHU

(BY STAFF CORRESPONDENT.)
Chicago, 111., June 5.—The Cummins
presidential campaign assumed a de
finite convention form on Sunday
afternoon when at a meeting of the
Iowa delegation held at the Cummins
headquarters in the Congress hotel the
delegate organization was effected.
Senator W. 8. Kenyon was chosen
as chairman and H. J. Clark of Des
Moines was selected as a member of
the resolutions committee. The steer
ing committee was also formed with
the selection of J. Reed Lane of Dav
enport, Charles Rawson of Des Moines
and George Call of Sioux City as its
members.
The session was one of the most
enthusiastic of the preliminary gath
erings held In the convention city yes
terday.
Many Delegates Present.
The presence of a majority of tie
members of the Iowa delegation here
yesterday attracted encouraging at
tention to Iowa's favorite son. Dur
ing the day the Cummins headquar
ters were visited by scores of Iowans
who are displaying the keenest inter
est in the Iowan's candidacy. Among
those Included in the delegation who
were present yesterday were:
Lamonte Cowles of Burlington, J.
Reed Lane of Davenport, A. M. Cloud
of Manchester, C. F. Johnston of Shef
field, C. H. McNlder of Mason City,
J. W. Sandusky of New Hampton, D.

To Entertain Delegates.
An invitation extended by the Hawk
eye Club of Chicago was yesterday
accepted by the Iowa delegation, which
will be entertained at a dinner on Wed
nesday evening at the Hamilton club.
This function is expected to advance
materially the Cummins candidacy.
Plans for the affair are only in a pre
liminary stage and will likely remain
informal. A toast program which Is
to be announced later, is expected to
include the names of those most promi
nent in the Cummins campaign.
Optimism Flows High.
A spirit of optimism permeates the
Cummins headquarters. A confidence
which appears to be lacking in the
headquarters of the other favorite sons
was strikingly evident about the meet
ing place of the Iowa delegation yes
terday. Less bunting and more en
thusiasm was the observation of the
caller.

WOMIN OPEN UP
IT CHICAGO MEET
Chicago, Jun6 5.—To the suffragists
goes the honors of opening conven
tion week in Chicago for the congres
sional union for woman suffrage, an
organization pledged to the support
of the Susan B. Anthony suffrage
amendment, opened its convention at
the Blackstone theater today for a
three days* session during which time
it is planned to form a body to be
kpown as the woman's party.
Tomorrow the national woman suf
rage association, a federation of state
suffrage associations will begin a two
days session at the Princess theater.
The two organizations are different,
in that the former seeks to secure
suffrage through national channels,
while the later is working for suffrage
in individual states submitting the
question of women's voting to the
electorate of the states.
The suffragists have prepared a
plank calling for equal suffrage which
will be presented to republican con
vention with the request that it be
placed In the party platform. Accord
ing to suffrage leaders the women hold
the balance of power for the states in
which they vote, cast one-fifth of the
electoral vote and one-third of the vot
ers necessary to elect a president.
Their strength, they declare will be
swung to the party favoring suffrage
and declaring for it.

John Schafer, Jr., was arrested

thla' morning's fire. Several ar

at the Schafer home south of

Hedrlck, June B. (Special)—Eight
automobiles were destroyed and three
buildings damaged In an $8,000 fire
which visited the business section of
this city about 1:80 o'clock this morn
ing. Only a very small amount of in
surance is carried on any of the lasses
The blaze was discovered in the of
fice of the O. E. Thorne garage and
spread quickly through the building
whioh was owned by George Watts.
Mr. Thorne had four cars of his own
in the building but only one was insur
ed. He places his loss at $3,000 and
Mr. Watts values his building at the
same figure. Beside Mr. Thome's cars
there were four others in the building.
They were owned by Edward Mowrey,
John Wray of Bloomfield, John Abbott
and John Bertsch. Mr. Bertsch just
bought his machine last Friday and
there was no insurance on any of the
others.
The blaze attacked the walls of the
First National bank building, adojining
the garage and caused the bricks to
settle about an inch to one side. The
windows were broken and the loss is
placed at $200. On the other side Is
R. B. Johnson ft Son's general store
and their loss is placed 'at $100 from
smoke and water. Charles Sheets, own
er of the building, was damaged to the
extent of $600. A variety store ad
joining the Johnson place was slight
ly damaged.
Spectators agree that Hedrlck's new
water plant easily paid for itself dur
ing the morning's fire. The men were
able to keep the blaze under control
by excellent water pressure.
The Ottumwa fire department was
called to Hedrick but later advised
that the blaze was under control.
CONGRESS BEGINS

whereby only business of a routine
nature should be taken up for the next
two weeks to permit members of con
gress to attend the conventions. There
will be no session of the senate until
Thursday.
Most republican senators and repre

MEDIUM VOTE IN IOWA PR&
DICTED FOR PRIMARY WHICH
IS BEING HELD TODAY.
Des Moines, Jons 6.—Indications are
that a vote of only medium slse will
be cast in today's state-wide guberna
torial primary, in the opinion of polltt
cal leaders here. Reports of threatenr
lng showers were general over the
state and the possibility of rain It was
thought, might cut down the vote. On
the one hand it was pointed out, good
weather might keep the farmers en
gaged in their fields and too busy to
get away and vote.
The vote in the cities is expected to
be large. The republican gubernator
ial contest, interest in which was
heightened by the recent conference
of supporters of Senator Jos Allen
and Attorney General Geo. Cosson is
said to have replaced the suffrage
amendment as the paramount
lBsue.
Leaders readily admitted that "it was
anybody's race," and the vote is ex
pected to be extremely close with pos
sibly a little edge In favor of W. L.
Harding of Sioux City, the present
lieutenant-governor. The split of the
so-called "dry'' factions between Allen
and Cosson Is believed materially to
have Increased Harding's chance for
the nomination. Supporters of Carl
Kuehnle declared that the vote for
their man "would surprise the state."
E. T. Meredith, democratic candi
date, is unopposed for the guberna
torial nomination.
The consensus of opinion was that
the amendment providing equal suf
frage for women would carry. Efforts
of suffrage advocates to bring out
their entire voting strength in all parts
of the state, today were unceasing.
The polls will close at 8 p. m., and
returns are expected to be very slow.
MANY CHANGE PARTIES.
Davenport, June 5. —More changes
In party affiliation were recorded at
the polls here today than ever before
since the primary law was enacted.
Scores of democrats are calling for re
publican ballots. This is due, It is
thought, to the lack of contests among
the democrats and intense interest In
the gubernatorial contest on the re
publican ticket.
PICKET8 AT POLL8.
Burlington, June 5.—Women pickets
hedged the polling places in Burling
ton today handing voters literature
favorable to suffrage. The anti
suffrage wonien were not represented
around the polls. The day is fair and
the effort on the part of the suffrage
advocates to get out a large vote may
prove successful.
HEAVY VOTE ON 8UFFRAGE.
Dubuque, June 6.—Fair weather In
northeastern Iowa indicates heavy
primary election votes In the cities
and comparatively light vote in coun
try precincts. Indications are for a
heavy vote on suffrage question.
VERDUN RATTLE
Paris, June 5.—In their repeated at
tacks on Ft. Vaux, one of the outly
ing defenses of Verdun along the front
east of the Meuse, the Germans are
hurling forward their infantry in
masses so compact that the flrst ranks
are obliged to advance to certain
death. The assaulting columns de
bouch from the village of Damloup,
below the fort, and separated from It
by a ravine which they are obliged
to cross to attain the slopes near the
fort. For three days this spot has
been the scene of carnage which has
saturated the ground with blood.
One German column advanced no
further than the bottom of the ravine.
The front ranks pushed on by those
behind, fell as fast as they reached
the dead line swept by the French
quick firers. As they toppled over oth
ers came on to take their places and
fall in turn.
French officers who have returned
from the Verdun front, although hard
