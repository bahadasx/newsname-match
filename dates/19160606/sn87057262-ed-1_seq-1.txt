During the past year, Lord Kitch

of his death he had little control

CHICAGO, June 6.—Determined on
a program of Roosevelt or nothing,
the radioal bull moose today jumped
square Into the limelight with a chal
lenge to conservative progressives to
do their worst.
Delegates from eighteen southern
and western states, headed the move
ment and were believed today to have
aligned with them Victor Murdock,
chairman of the progresnlve national
committee, Wm. Allen White, Kansas
bull moose chairman, and Raymond
Robins who will be temporary chair
man of the progressive convention.
They have determined on this pro
gram: Nominate Roosevelt Friday,
the third day of the convention.
Run a third party If the republi
cans refused to accept the colonel.
When word of the conference of the
eighteen state delegations reached
Victor Murdock today, ths Kansasan
said:
"We will nominate Theo. Roose
velt you may quote me to that
effect."
Members of this radical olan today
characterized the first pn^.lc utter
ance of Justice Hughes, raada lat.i
yesterday in Washington as a typi
cal pussyfoot speech.
""hey realized a bid for progressive
cupport for Hughes would be made
on the basis of the Amerlcmism issue
la Hughes' address.
They held, however, tnat tLl3
speech was so full of glltto -ing gener
alities as to be meaningless.
Hughes has not made a single
plain statement of his platform, the
radicals declared.
State caucuses of progressives to
day were expected to sharpen the
allingment of radicals and conserva
tives. The national committee plans
to have a conservative representative
at each caucus'to prevent any action
toward an immediate nomination of
Lrrsevelt. The committee meet in
pyecutive session late !n the after
noon to consider the flght John M.
Parker, Louisiana state chairman, and
others headed the delegation last
night.
"The progressives of the south have
left the democratic party forever,"
declared ParUer, "and they will not
be merged with the republican party.
They want no compromise with any
body."
