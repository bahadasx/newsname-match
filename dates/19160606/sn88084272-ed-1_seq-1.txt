"Press Special" of ten cars, about 9.15
"There were about 266 of us on board
when the train left Fort Worth and
we continued to pick them up all the
way." he continued. Mr. Whitman is
accompanied by Mrs. Whitman and Miss
Whitman.
It is estimated that the number mast
have been close to 256 when the train
reached El Paso. What Mr. Whitman
said about having had a fine trip would
seem to be the representative sentiment
of the entire de'egation.
"Glad We're. Here."

here, and we're glad of It." said Miss '
