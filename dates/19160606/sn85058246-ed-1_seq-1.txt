H Director John O'Brien and His as-
H sistant recorded tho taking of anoth-
M cr scene for the Famous Players

1 Miss PIckford plays the sympathetic
M and touching role of tho overworked,
hard driven llttlo slave of the mach-
m lno, as only the highest paid actress
M in tho world could interpret it. Dut
M In tho character enacted by tho cele-
H bratcd star as tho slave of tho ma-
H ehlno sho is the mistress of every-

M for that Is the nanus of tho charac-
H ter has two sisters, ono Is a moral
weakling and the other a chronicle
m Invalid. They aro all employed in
B tho samo factory, the owner of which
H James Wharton Is a grasping man
B who refuses to mako any concessions
H to guard the Uvea or happiness of

I lielplng her home, Owen first meets
I Mary, and tho friendship ripens Into
I ldvo as ho nssists her in moving in
I to smaller quarters whero her slen-
I der savlngu are expended in doctor-
I lng Jane. Rcnllzlng that tho girl's
I- Ufa depends on her being taken out
I of tho city, Mary goes to Wharton
I Sr., to beg for an ndvanco on licr
I salary, but is refused. Her beauty
I attracts Ernest, who succeeds In win-
I nlng her appreciation by promised
I favors". Ho proceeds to mako violent
I lovo to Mary until Amy, oecomlng
I suspicious, follows him to Mary's
I now abode with a rovolver, bent on
