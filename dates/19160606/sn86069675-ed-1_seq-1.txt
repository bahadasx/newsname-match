S. Kelly, against the Chesapeake &
Ohio R. R. Co. some month's ago in
the Montgomery CircuiSCourt, was
reversed in the Supreme Court of
the United States and remanded
here for re-trial because of errors
in he instructions as shown by the
following Washington dispatch :
"Reversing decisions of state
courts in Kentucky and other
states, the Supreme Court Monday
held that juries should bo instruct
ed that in nwarding damages (under
the. Federal Employers' Liability
law that 'fair cash value' of tho
damages suffered by beneficiaries
of employes injured or killed,
should be awarded, rather than a
sum equal to the full amount of
money the beneficiaries would have
received during the period of de
pendency. The court set aside a
$19,000 verdict rendered in Mont
gomery county, Ky., in favor of
Addie Kblly, widow of Matt Kelly,

for tho Chesapeake & Ohio Railway
Company."

BUYS PAIGE CAR

car. Tho Paigo is said to bo a
most excellent car.
LOOKS LIKE HUGHES
According to reports from Chica
go, the Republicans will nominate
Justice Hughes. Henry Breckin
ridge, writing for tho Lexington
Herald, says: "The pro-convention
struggle is nenrj completion. The
big lenders may know their own
purposes, under nil contingencies,
but do not disclose them. A few
definite facts appeared, however.
The Progressives will not stand
for Root. One of the three most
influential Progressives told me to
day his party would endorse Wil
son if Root wero nominated. They
hold Root responsible for counting
Roosevelt out in 1912 and will nev
er forgive him. The best inform
ed newspaper men say Roosevelt
can not be nominated but can dic
tate tho nomination, of nny one else.
Lodge is busy writing the plat
form. Weeks is the mc-st tionular
of the less prominent possibilities.
Hughes looms biggest on the hori
zon but Roosevelt is regnrded n n
,very uncertain powder magazine."

sioner W. HofTmnn Wood, Satur

livan and A. J. Gatewood as sure
