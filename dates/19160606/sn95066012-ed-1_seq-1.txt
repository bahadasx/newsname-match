TROUT DINNER PROVES SUCCESS
Fish and Gabe Association Heard In
teresting Speakers on Stream Stock
ing at Putnam House Stag Dinner
One of the best attended dinners in
the history of the Benlugton Coun
ty Forest Fish and Game association
was held in tho Putnam House dining
room Monday evening at 9 o'clock with
85 sportsmen and thoir guests present.
Fifty-nine pounds of trout caught in the
streams of Bennington county the past
two days formed the oasis of tho lishy
eats and for onco this season every
man who attended had enough trout.
Credit for originating the affair has
largely been giveu to S. D. Hawks, who
believed Bennington fishermen had
skill enough to provide the main
course for eighty to a hundred men
and that a dinner at this time was a
good method of reviving the interest
in the work of the association. The
officers fell In with tho plan heartily
and worked hard for its success. Every
ticket which was printed was sold and
no hitch occurred anywhere to spoil the
three hours of chewing either trout or
rag, which kept the affair open till
mid-night.
There were 11 tables seating 10 men
each, all of which were filled by 9.15.
The dinner entire consisted of boui
llon, trout, mashed potato, salads,
peas, and a dessert comprising a good
sized piece of strawberry shortcake.
Two legal-sized trout were served
each man with his order, a platter of
the flsh afterward being placed in the
center of each table.
The speaking began about 10 o'clock
Norman R. Greenslet, president of the
association, acting as toastmaster. He
proved to be a good one. The first
man he called on for oratory wa3 for
mer-president Warwick Carpenler. Mr.
Carpenter spoke without preparation
but gave some Interesting accounts of
the propagation of trout as tha state of
New York is carrying it on in lakes
and streams. He also advocated the
association importing a few pairs of
beaver to be liberated in the raoun
tains about here, declaring that
wherever beaver were allowed to build
their dams across the mountain water
falls, tho fishing at once improved far
and beyond anything detrimental
.which might be attached to the prcs
nce of the little animals.
VI. S. Casselman of Dorset, associate
ed ith State Commissioner Tltconib
in his work, was the next speaker and
used 35 minutes with an interesting
explanation of tho reason why the re
cent hatchery in Arlington wai nban
doned. He told of rotting vegetation
on the bottom of the reservlor forming
an obnoxious gas which permeated the
water and ogan proving fatal to the
fish. Ho stated, however, thet the
hatchery project had not been aban
doned and that three sites for another
attempt were ncv under consideration,
one in Bennington, one in Dorset and
one lnEast Dorset. Mr. Casselmun al
so took up the quesMon of tho advant
age of fingerlings ovsr fry and many
other techlnical matter.

Future Depends on Willingness
of I
Each Generation to Perform
Patriotic Service.
Washington, June 5. in the se
clusion of the National Cathedral
school lawn, whore he was presenting
an American Hag to tho honor gradu
ates, Justice Charles E. Hughes today
made his first public address since the
opening of the pre-convention cam
paign. He told the young women grad
uates that the flag meant America
first, an undivided allegiance, ami a na
tion united and equal to Its tasks.
"This flag means more than associa
tion and reward," said Justice Hughes.
'It Is tho symbol of our national unity,
cur national endeavor, our national as
piration. It tells you of tho struggle
for independence, of union preserve, of
liberty and union one and inseparable
of the sacrifices of the brave men and
women to whom the ideals and honor
of this nation have been dearer than
life.
It means America first; it means an
undivided allegiance. It means Amer
ica united; strong and elficlent. equa
to its tasks. It means you cannot be
saved by the valor and devotion of
your ancestors; that to each genera
tion conies its patriotic duty; and that
upon your willingness to sacrifice and
endure, as those before you have sac
rlficed and endured, rests the national
hope.
"It speaks of equal rights; of the in
spiration of fret institutions exempli
fied and vindicated; of liberty under
law intelligently conceived and impar
tlally administered. I here is not a
thread in it but scorns self-indulgence,
weakness and rapacity. It is eloquent
cf our common Interests, outweighing
all divergencies of opinion and' of our
common destiny.
"Given as a prize to those who have
highest standing, it happily enforces
the lesson that intelligence nnd zeal
must go together; that discipline must
accompany emotion and that we must
ultimately rely upon enlightened
opinion."
Under the custom of the school, the
student at the head of the graduating
class receives as a reward tho fla
which has flown over the school
grounds all year. Several months ago
Justice Hughes was inlvited to make
the presentation address, but no an
nouncement of his acceptance ever
was made.
Miss Catherine Hughes, daughter of
tho justice, was a member of the
graduating class, but she missed the
coveted honor of winning the flag by
a few points, taking rank among the
first ten.
In beginning his nddress, Justice
HugheB told tho graduates that the
Intellectual Inheritance or t lie ago
counted only as it actually was
noKsessed and used, lie said it was a
miserable spectacle to see youth tie
electing the lessons of science, the in
st ruction of history, the resources of
liteiature, and art; and leading a life
small and impoverished, amid the op
portunities of tho twentieth century
Alluding then to the beauty of the
prize he was awarding, he told of the
associations and memories of school
life It would recall, and concluded with
the declaration of the broader national
spirit it represented.

TO CHI LOSS
Assert Big Battle Ship Was Sunk
in Jutland Fight
TORPEDOED BY DESTROYERS
London Now Estimates Eighteen Ger
man Ships and Fourteen British
Vessels Went Ddwh.
London, June 6. British officers of
the fleet which participated in the Jut
land battle and have returned identify
two of the big German warships sunk
as the Hindenbtirg and the Lutzow.
The Lutzow, a battle cruiser of 2G.0O0
tons, was built at Ranzig and com
pleted in 1915. She was armed with
eight 12-inch, and 12 21-pounder
guns. Her armor belt was about 13
inches in thickness amidships. She
CS9 feet long and of the latest
and most powerful battle cruiser type.
The Hindenbtirg is not listed in the
latest naval records. It has been re
ported, however, that she was a bat-
telshlp of the largest and most power
ful dreadnought type. She was
launched in the fall of 1915.
Survivors arriving at Edinburgh
Scot., front British destroyers which
made a massed attack upon a German
battleship in the Jutlaurt battle are
convinced thai they sent to' the lKt
tom tlie dreadnought Hindenburg. the
pride of the German navy. These
sailors say that the Hindenburg was
struck successively by four torpedoes
while the destroyers dashed in along
side of her hull, tearing her to pieces
until the mighty ship reeled and sank.
In view of the latest report of the
Britislt admiralty the press and public
are devoting tneir attention to com
puling the losses of the two navies and
the effeit the engagement is likely to
have on future naval warfare, says
dispatch from London. I lie nest es
timate of is German snips lost, as
compared with 14 British, Is acceptei
by the majority and the result Is now
claimed as a complete victory tor tin1
British fleet.
So far as the German denial of the
British claim is concerned. It is point
ed out that the Germans did not ad
mit tho loss of the cruiser Elbing tin
til the arrival of some survivors in
Holland and this is cited as confirma
tion that the Germans conceal their
losses until forced by circumstances
to reveal them.
Berlin. June 5, (by Wireless via
Sayville.) An authoritative account
of the North Sea battle, issued here to
day, gives the tirst detailed picture of
the engagement between the German
High Seas Fleet and that of the Brit-
It h.
Many details of the engagement aro
suppressed for strategic reasons, leav
ing unsatisfied for the present the tier
man public's thirst for interesting;
touches in regard to tho individual
achievements of tho German warships
and the manner In which the mighty
British vessels were sent to the bot
tom. The recital, however, meets clearly
what Is characterized as the British at
tempt to explain defeat by the state
ment that tho German sea forces in
tho action were much larger than
those which the British were able to
bring into play.
This account states explicitly that
twenty-six of Admiral Jellieoo's most
powerful battleships, Including six of
the most modern Queen Elizabeth
class, and the entire British flying
wing, composed or mutle cruisers
equal to dreadnoughts in every re
spect except armor protection, were en
gactd in all but. the early Mages of the
day battle. The fleet thus nsse.Vbled
Htirpnfsed In tonnage and weight of
broadsides the German Torces engaged,
was tit least equally modern, and was
fnr speedier than the squadron of
Gorman pre dreadnoughts, which, lum
bering along at eighteen or nineteen
knots, were soon left far to the rear
by ieir swifter consorts, out of the
main action.

BULL MOOSE RUNNING WILD
Progressive Delegates from South and
Southwest Want Roosevelt
Without Delay.
Chicago, June G. All indications to
day show that the republican organi
zation will be able to control the con
vention w hen tho delegates are called
to order on Thursday. The old guard
have as yet adopted no aggressive tac
tics but are endeavoring to Iron out
the wrinkles created by the split four
years ago. I lie old guard Is united
for a candidate who can win and unite
the party.
Chicago, June 0. Delegates to the
progressive convention from 18 states
in the south and southwest have unit
ed In a demand that Roosevelt be
nominated on the first ballot.
Chicago, June 6. George W. Per
kins, chairman of the national pro-
pressive committee, issued a manifes
to today in which he declared that
the convention would nominate Roose
veil or no one. "We have no second
clkwtas" tho manifesto concluded.
Chicago, June (!. Representatives of
the several candidates for the republi
can presidential nomination were in a
perplexing predicament last night
Having fostered sentiment in favor of
Justice Hughes until they felt sure
Col Roosevelt was definitely eliminat
ed, they now fear they cannot control
the Hughes movement. During the day
it grew to the proportions of a boom.
Effort is being made to concentrate all
elements against It, and the indica
tions are that the veto of the progres
sue party, which, or course, means
Col. Roosevelt's disapproval of Hughes
may be sought as a check.
Harmony above everything else is
the desire of the leaders. Without it
any nominee would answer the pur
pose, because it is recognized that un
less the republicans and progressives
get together, their chance of success
at the polls is very slim. To obtain
harmony, the republican leadtrs are
willing to concede to Col. Roosevelt
the veto power in some form. Some of
the leaders say lie should hn willing
to select one or two men who would
be acceptable to him from the list of
candidates In the field. Others think
he should sugges men for considera
tion by convention leaders nnd virtual
ly all of the party chiefs are willing
to admit that any of the candidates
definitely rejected by Col. Roosevelt
could not be nominated.
With the arrival of hundreds of dele
gates yesterday, the sentiment in fav
or of Hughes reached high tide, nnd In
spite cf the concentration upon him of
tho opposition forces, he appears to be
lar in the lead. Managers of the
favorite son candidates have made no
headway to combine against Hughes,
because he is the second choice of
many of the instructed delegates and
trading is dangerous. Every attempted
transfer, it is feared, would result in
spilling some delegates Into the
Hughes basket. Unless the situation
changes very soon, these delegates are
almost certain to Hop to him, Bhould
there be more than two or three bal
lots without a nomination.
On every hand there seems to be
sentiment to avoid making- the nomi
nee the campaign issue and to select
some one on whom republicans and
progressives can agree so tho word
will go out to the country that the
party has been rehabilitated by the
uniting of factions which split It four
years ago. It Is realized that of all
the possibilities, Col. Roosevelt has the
gteatest personal following, but tit the
same time be has the most enemies.
Tho republican leaders charged that
many voters would be alienated for
one or morn of several reasons. The
conviction that Col Roosevelt would
not be able to unite the party has led
to general declarations In favor of
the nomination of some strong man
who may not have the popularity of
Col. Roosevelt, but whose nomination
would be a signal to the country that
tho factional strife has been ended.
Tho officials and nearly all of the
local attorneys are In Manchester to
day to attend the opening of the June
term of county court. Judge Frank L.
Fish ot Vergennes will preside.

on His Way to Petro-
London, June C Earl Kitchener,
minister of war and all of the mem
bers of his staff, were lost in the sink
ing of the cruiser Hampshire off the
north coast of Scotland, according to
a statement made by the admiralty
this morning.
A later dispatch states that the
Hampshire was torpedoed off the Ork
ney islands.
Further particulars announced by
the admiralty are to the effect that the
cruiser was either torpedoed or struck
a mine off tlu Orkney islands. There
Is little hope that Kitchener or any
member of his staff survived the dis
aster. Vessels returning front the lo
cality in which the Hampshire went
down report observing only bodies aud
one broken boat.
The Hampshire was on her way to
Russia and Earl Kitchener was mak
ing tho journey for the purpose of con
ferring with the Russian officials at
Petrograd.
The Hampshire was a cruiser of
Artyll type. She was 655 feet long,
had a displacement of 10,850 tons and
carried 450 officers and men.
Horatio Herbert Kitchener wa3 born
in County Kerry, Ireland, June 24, 1850, "
the son of English parents, his father
having been an officer In the English
army. He was educated at the royal
military academy at Woolwich and en
tered the royal engineers in 1871. Up
on the outbreak of the troubles in
Egypt in 1882 he was put in charge of
the Egyptian cavalry. Thus began his
connection with the Egyptain service
which was developed into one of the
most noteworthy achievements of all
the achievements ot arms. He was in
the Nile expedition in 1884 which fail
ed to rescue Gordon and was promoted
and decorated for gallant service. Iu
1S8G he was made governor of Suakim.
Two years later he led tho Egyptian
troops in the notable battle with Os-
man Digna at llandub. During the
same year he was promoted to bo ad
jutant general of the Egyqtian army.
In 1M0 he was made Sirdar, or commander-in-chief
of the Egyptien army
and performed one of the greatest
works of his time. He smashed the
Madhi and restored order in the Sou
dan. The task was of ten years dura
tion but at the end of a decade it was
complete, in 1S9!I he was made gov
ernor of Soudan and in the same year
was called to be first lieutenant and
then 'successor to Lord Roberts in tho
Boer war. The credit for the success
ful terminus of the Boer war and the
reorganization of affairs in South Afri
ca is largely given to Kitchener. In
1902 he became commander-in-chief in
India. Earl Kitchener became minis
ter of war In a reorganization of the
British cabinet after the opening of tho
present great struggle in Europe.

Last night the attacks went on with
unchecked violence. Inside tho fort
the French garrison was engaged in a
fierco struggle with tho German detach

Petrograd, June 6. Russian forces '
have won great successes along tho
front from the Pripet marslrcs to.tlio
Rumanian frontier, according to an of
ficial announcement. It is stated that
the Russians took 13.000 prisoners. '
A dispatch from Vienna says that
the Russians began heavy artillery
action over a largo part, of tho front

war olllce. There are signs of Im
pending Infantry attacks. Tho an
nouncement follows: "Tho enemy's
nrtillerv this morning entered Into

The Russians made an attack with
gas on the Dniester, but did no dam
