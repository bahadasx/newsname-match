- "I have to report with deep regret
f that His Majeatv's ship Hampshire,
I Captain Herbert J. Savill, R. N.. with
Lord Kitchener and his staff on

p. m. to the west of the Orkneys,
either by a mine or a torpedo
"Four boats were seen by observers
on shore to leave the ship. The wind
was north, northwest and heavy seas
were running. Patrol vessels and de
stroyers at once proceeded to the
spot and a party was sent along the
coast to search, but only some bodies
and a capsized boat have been found
np to the present. As tho whole
Bhore has been searched greatly that
there is little hope of there being
any survivors. No report has yet
been received from the search party
an shore.
"H. M. S. Hampshire was on her
vay to Russia."
En Route to Russia.
Earl Kitchener was going to Russia
at the request of the Russian govern
ment He Intended to land at Arch
angel and visit Petrograd and prob
- ably go to the Russian front. His
! mission had chiefly to do with the
; supply of munitions for Russia.
The earl expected to be back in
London for the re-openlug of parlla
; ment on June 20.
i 1 An official statement Issued this ev
ening says that Earl Kitchener was to
have discussed important military and
financial questions with Emperor
Nicholas.
Special Editions Put Out.
As soon as the news of Earl Kitch
ener's death was circulated in special
editions of the newspapers crowds
started toward Whitehal. That thor
oughfare and its extension, Parlia
ment street, were soon filled with per
sons hoping that the first reports wore
1 exaggerated. They found no comfort.
1 Flag at Half Mast.
I Every blind of tho big block which
Ljj houses the war office was drawn and
I the flag was at half mast.
I The crowds grew greater as the
"i news became more generally known
'i and It was necessary to call out police
reserves to control them. In the west
end and financial district the news
5 was received with even greater evi
$ dences of regret than was the first re-
port of last week's naval battle which
made every one feel the British fleet
S'had suffered a severe defeat.

1. Chief Robertson Named.
5 London, June 0, 2:10 p. m, When
the news of the sinking of the cruiser
Hampshire with Earl Kitchener and
his Btaff on board was received In
' London the cabln'et council was lm
ll mediately called. Sir William Robert
' Bon, chief of the Imperial staff who
I probably will become the head of the
i ' ar office; Sir Edward Groy, secre
tary for foreign affairs, Reginald Mc
IKenna, chancellor of tho exchequer,
and David-Lloyd George, minister of
munitions, were present at tho coun
cil. I The newspaper reporters at tho war
? office who at the time had not heard
the news regarding Earl Kitchener an
i nounccd:
"Neither Earl Kitchener nor Prem-
ler Asqulth is present."
'r Who Will Succeed?
,' The first question aBked when the
'. news of Earl Kitchener's death was
I announced was: "Who will succeed
Shim?" The answer Invariably was
'"Robertson, of course."
I Sir William Robertson already had
; taken over tho war secretary's duties
''temporarily when the secretary start-
' ed on his Journey.
I The general has tho full confidence
j of the country. While he cannot be-
; come secretary of war until he Is rals-
'- d to the peerage, a member of tho
house of Lords might be put at the
7 head of the war office with the un
: derstandlng that tho genoral,' like Earl
I Kitchenor, would have a free reign.
I' BualnesB on the stock exchange was
If suspended when tho news of Earl
11? Kitchener's death was received. Tho
U" Members stood Idly about the door
v discussing tho nation's Iobb.
m) The markets had been firm all day

ft Inauguration of an offensive move

H
Accompanying Earl Kitchener as
his stiff were Hugh James O'Beime,
former councillor of the British em
bassy at Petrograd, and former min
ister at Sofia; 0. A. Fitzgerald, Earl
Kitchener's private military secre
tary; Brigadier-General Ellershaw,
and Sir Frederick Donaldson.
Premier Asqulth was to have at
tended the luncheon today of the Im
perial Council of Commerce and was
expected to deliver an important
speech there, but he was absent be
cause of tho news of the loss of the
Hampshire with Earl Kitchener and
momViorc nf lilc aivff
There Is no question that the tradi
tion of recent times picturing Earl
Kitchener as a man of extremely
plain life was over colored The
story that tho first thing he asked
for when ho took charge of the war
office was an iron bed on which to
sleep there,, was a fiction. The gov
ernment gave a handsome mansion.
York house, which Is a part of St
James palace, for a residence at the
beginning of the war. He surrounded
himself there with costly art objects
of which he was an enthusiastic col
lector. Lord Kitchener was one of the first
public men to announce to the world
that he would follow the appeal of
King George to the nation to abstain
from the use of alcohol during the
war.
On the stock exchange no news
since the outbreak of the war caused
such bitter feeling against the Ger
man members as did the announce
ment of Kitchener's death. After the
close the members met and adopted
a resolution asking the committee
publicly to expel the German mem
bers. Earl Kitchener was appointed, sec
retary of state for war on August 8,
1914, a few days after Great Britain's
declaration of war on Germany. He
was regarded as England's greatest
soldier and the decision of the govern
ment to entrust hfm with supreme
direction of the war was received by
unanimous approval.
As the war progressed and Great
Britain's deficiencies in certain direc
tions, particularly in regard to short
ago of artillery ammunition became
apparent, Earl Kitchener was sub
jected to severe criticism, led by Lord
Northcllffe. The secretary was
charged with responsibility for failure
to foresee the extraordinary demand
for heavy shells and as a result the
ministry of munitions was formed
with David Lloyd-George at Its head.
Earl Kitchener's responsibilities
were further lessened by tho appoint
ment of General Sir William Robert
son as chief of the imperial staff in
December of last year. It was report
ed at that time that friction had
arisen between Earl Kitchener and
Field Marshal French, then In com
mand of the British forces In Franco.
Shortly after the appointment of Gen
eral Robertson, Field Marshal French
relinquished his command.
Notwithstanding tho criticism di
rected against Earl Kitchener, his
great accomplishments during the
war are recognized universally. Fore
most of his achievements In the crea
tion from England's untrained man
hood of a huge army. At the begin
ning of the war Great Britain had
only a few hundred thousand trained
men. Today more than five million
men are enrolled for the various
branches of the service.
There have been no recent reports
of Earl Kitchener's movements. He
was last mentioned in the cable dis
patches of Friday when he went to
Westminister Palace to bo questioned
by members of the house of commons
who were not satisfied with the con
duct of the war. No Intimation was
given that he intended to leave England.

VIOLENT BATTLE RAGING ALONG
RUSSIAN FRONT FOR 208' MILES
Petrograd, June 6, via London, 6:10 a. m. It is esti
mated that the Russians in their new offensive campaign on
the southwestern battle front are opposed by forces number
ing between 600,000 and 650,000. The line between the
Pripet marshes and the Rumanian border is more than 250
miles in length.
Petrograd, June 6, via London, 7:24 p. m. The Rus
sians continue to develop the successes won by their newly in
augurated offensive. It is reported that up to the present' time
they have captured 25,000 men, seventeen cannon and fifteen
machine guns.
Amsterdam, June 6, via. London,. 4i23.p...m.rrDispatcKes
from Vienna report that a violent battle has been raging dur
ing the last 24 hours on the Russian front along a sweep of
300 kilometers (about (200 miles). The correspondents de
scribe countless waves of Russian infantry being sent into the
battle.
General Brusiloff who is believed to be in command of
the Russian forces on this front seems, according to the ad
vices, to be following the tactics pursued by the Russians in
the Carpathians, making attacks in mass in an effort to break
through the hostile line.
Great Britain today is mourning the
loss of her most noted military chief
tain, Field Marshal Earl Kitchener,
head of the British war office. Earl
Kitchener, with members of his staff
on their way to RusBla, were on board
the British cruiser Hampshire, sunk
last night off the Orkney islands,
either by a mine or torpedo. It
seems certain that Earl Kitchener
with nil others on board the warship
have been lo6t
London dispatches Indicate the
probability that Sir William Robert
son, chief of the imperial army staff
who Ib In London, will become the
now secretary of war.
Russians Face Great Army.
Tho Russians In their drive along
the front from the Pripet marshes to
the Rumanian border are, according
to Petrograd, confronted for the most
part by Austrians estimated to num
ber between 600,000 and 640,000. Pe
trograd has reported notable succes
ses in the initial attacks.
The German infantry once more
has been thrown into the fray In
charges on the French front north
east of Verdun but , according to
Paris, the1 assaults lacked the Inten
sity of previous ruaes and were en
tirely unsuccessful
Paris, June 6. Noon. Two attacks
by tho Germans on the French linos
between Fort Vaux and Damloup on
tho Verdun front were repulsed by
tho French last night, according to
an official statement Issued by the
war office today. The heavy bom
bardment of Fort Vaux continues with
intermittent cannonading on tho west
front.
The text of the statement says:
"On the right bank of the Meuse
two German attacks last night against
our positions between Vaux and Dam
loup resulted In complete failure.
"No change has been recorded in
the situation at Fort Vaux which tho
enemy is bombarding with violence.
"There has been continued Intermit
tent cannonading on the remainder of
the front."
Fort Vaux Center of Fight.
Paris, June 6, 1:20 p. m. Fort Vaux,
one of the northeastern defenses of
Verdun, continues to bo the center of
German efforts but tho French still
hold tho main fort and all approaches
except tho northern most in which
the Germans gained lodgment several
days ago.
The Germans are now directing
their efforts toward bringing up mas
ses of reinforcements through tho ra
vines between Vaux and Damloup
which are gradually wearing down the
determined resistance of tho French.
Although two infantry attacks were
made yesterday they lacked the In
tensity of the previous rushes. The
conclusion 1 drawn by Frenoh. com-
r
mentators that the heavy recent loss
es of the Germans are compelling
them to proceed less vigorously for
the moment while they are re-forming
their scattered and decimated units.
Berlin, June 6. Via London, 4:30
p, m. French troops on the right
bank of the river Meuse in the Verdun
sector last night made four deter
mined efforts to eject tho Germans
from positions on Fumln ridge, says
the official statement issued today at
Germany army headquarters. All tho
attempts were repulsed by the East
Prussian regiments with especially
heavy losses, the statement adds to
the attackers
The text of the statement says:
"Western theater: On the eastern
bank of the Meuse after renewed and
very heavy artillery preparation the
positions of our brave East Prussian
on Fumln ridge were four times at
tacked during tho night without the
slightest success. Tho enemy suffered
especially heavy losses from our com
bined artillery curtain, machine gun
and infantry fire."
Belgian Forces In Africa.
Havre, France, June 6, via Paris.
The Belgian forces operating In Ger
man East Africa have penetrated 125
miles into the enemy's territory since
the middle of April, according to an
official statement Issued by the Bel
gian war office.
The statement says:
"At the end of May tho situation of
our forces In German East Africa was
a follows: Our left column rested
on the river Kagera. Our center had
crossed the Akanjaru where the en
emy forces were reported to have con
centrated, our right column approach
ing the town of Usumboria.
"According to the prisoners the
enemy is demoralized by reverses. A
provisional government has been es
tablished by us In Ruanda."
Tho town of Usumberia is the capi
tal of the German province of Urumn
dl, on the east shore of Lake Tangan
yika. Big War Credit Urged.
Berlin, June 5, via London, June 6,
7:30 a. m. The government Intro
duced a bill in the relchstag today ask
ing for a war credit of twelve billion
marks. Various now tax bills Includ
ing the bill for the special tax on
war profits, were advanced to their
third reading.

City resolutions were passed calling
upon ICing Alfonso to Join with the
Latin countries of both continents In

to an official message received here

'
ing of confidence was evident that
the government would be able to

Probably because of tho strict cen

Suicide Stoitly Denied.
Yuan Shi Kai died at 1 o'clock this
morning in the palace surrounded by
his wives and older children. Ru
mors that he committed suicide are
stoutly denied by high officials.
The commandants of the legation's
guard, Including the German and Aus
trian, met today and discussed the sit
uation here, coming to the decision
that rioting was unlikely. The Amer
ican and British commandants ad
vised their nationals living outside the
legation quarter that it was safe to
remain there for the present
LI Yuan-Hung will take the presi
dential oath tomorrow.
Chinese are rushing Into the lega
tion quarter, taking their valuables
with them and engaging hotel accom
modations there.
Yuan Shi Kai had been ill for sev
eral days with stomach trouble, which
was followed by a nervous break
down. Quiet prevails today In the capital.
The death of the president apparently
solves the heated political crisis. LI
Yuan-Hung's succession to the presi
dency meets the demands of the lead
ers in the southern provinces.
Yuan Shi Kai was reported to have
been taken Beriously ill on May 28.
At that time dispatches from China
said it was believed in Peking that
the president had been poisoned but
this report was denied by the Chinese
ambassador at Washington who insist
ed that the president was not even
ill.
Died While Storm Gathered.
Yuan Shi Kai died while the storm
of revolution were gathering In In
creasing strength. The revolt broke
out in December, 1915, when the pres
ident announced his intention of es
tablishing a monarchy and ascending
the throne as the first emperor of a
new dynasty. His coronation was set
for early in February of this year, but
was postponed indefinitely owing to
the extraordinary rapidity with which
therevolt spread through southern
China. Several attempts were made
upon the president's life and a bomb
was discovered in the imperial palace.
Monarchy Strenuously Opposed.
The establishing of a monarchy
was strenuously opposed by Japan and
the final abandonmenjQJno Plan 1!Vas
largely credited to the representa
tions made by Tokio.
The revolt progressed, however, and
in March the governors of the Chinese
provinceB demanded the resignation
of the president In May tho provin
ces of Shansi and Shantung announc
ed their Independence ana a provision
al government was established by the
generals commanding the rovolution
arv forces In the south. President Shi
Kai announced on May 26 his inten
tion to resign when a suitable succes
sor was chosen. It was reported a
little later that the president Intended
to take refuge In Japan and dispatches
from Tokio said that he was negoti
ating for a residence in the Japanese
capital. ,
LI Yuan-Hung Succeeds.
Li Yuan-Hung, who becomes presi
dent of China in the regular course of
events would remain in office until
October of next year when the term
of five years for which Yuan Shi Kai
was elected will expire. Owing to dis
turbed political conditions, however,
his tenuro of office is uncertain.
Li Yuan Hung Is reported to have
been in sympathy with the rebel move
ment although little has been heard
of his activities In recent months. The
state department at Washington was
advised Mav 17 that he had been elec
ted president of four seceding pro
vinces in south China.
LI Yuan Hung is 52 years old. He
served on a cruiser during the Chino
Japanese war and later entered the
army, holding several commands and
spent two years in Japan to study for
tifications. , xl
On tho outbreak of the revolution
at Wuchang he was coerced into ac
cepting command of the revolutionary
forces whose operations he directed.
He was mainly Instrumental In ar
ranging the Shang Hal peace confer
ence and after the abdication of the
Manchus was elected vice president
and appointed chief of the general
staff. Ho was made a general and
in October 1913 was re-elected vice
president
Washington, June 6. A cablegram
to the state department today from
American Minister Relnsch at Peking
announced tho death of Yuan Shi Kai,
president of China,
The minister's message, dated at
Peking at 11 a. m. today, said Yuan
died last night and that Premier Tuan
Chi Jul had announced that ho would
give his full support to tho vice presi
dent, LI Yuan-Hung. No details of
the president's death were given and
no mention made of the widely cir
culated and officially denied reports
that he had been poisoned.
Order to Be Restored.
. It Is generally believed here that
the accession of LI Yuan-Hung to the
presldenoy will make possible early
restoration of order In China and
bring the revolting and loyal prov
inces together. LI has occupied a pe
culiar position, having taken sharp
Isbuo with Yuan In opposition to the
restoration of the monarchy and being
thoroughly imbued with republican
Ideals.
LI Is declared to bo ono of the most
popular men In China because ho has
abstained from factional quarrels and
has a reputation for high Integrity.

Secret Meeting of Republicans

OHIO MAN REJECTED
Man Who Can Draw From All
Sections Wanted, Otherwise,
Compromise Talk
Is Futile.
Chicago, Juno 6. How Progressive
leaders at a secret conference with
old guard Republicans late last night
declined to consider Theodore E. Bur
ton of Ohio as a compromise candidate
for the Republican presidential nom
ination became public today.
Senator Smott presented Mr. Bur
ton's name. In company with Repre
sentative McKinloy of Illinois he call
ed on Governor Johnson of California,
William Allen White of Kansas and
Horace Wilkinson of New York, the
Progressive steering committee, and
said he was ready to talk compromise.
"We think the time has come for
nominating a compromise candidate"
he was quoted today by a Progressive
leader as saying. "He Is a man who
will unite us, draw heavily from the
German and pacifist voio and carry
us to victory next fall."
"Who is he?" chorused the Pro
gressives. Smoot Names Burton.
"Theodore E. Burton of Ohio" Mr.
Smoot replied.
For a moment there was silence.
Then Governor Johnson sprang from
HIS Clliill iuu uefcliu namiufe uuv-n. auu
forth across the room but saying noth
ing. Another of the Progressives finally
spoke.
Progressives Turn Him Down.
"You have expressed the real vital
difference between the Republican
and Progressive parties in their meth
ods of selecting candidates for tho
presidency," ho said, "You, would
name a man who can pick up the scat
tering vote of factions hero and there.
We want a candidate who can draw
from all sections of tho country and
until wo can agree upon such a man
all talk of a compromise Is futile."
A few minutes later the old guard
trio withdrew further discussion of
candidates.
