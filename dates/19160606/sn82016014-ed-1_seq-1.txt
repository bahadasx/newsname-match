Chicago, June 6. Kansas Progres
sives united today in their demand for
the nomination of Roosevelt in the
third party convention. Twenty stand
pat Republican delegates from the
Sunflower state locked horns in a
fight which involves the elimination
of both Hughes and Roosevelt. Eleven
of the twenty delegates stood out
,!nct Hni-hea and are expected to
loin the forces of the allies, who will
support either Roosevelt, Weeks, Bur
ton, Fairbanks or Sherman.
At a conference of the Kansas
Progressives today a unanimous de
mand was made that the third party
convention nominate Roosevelt. The
Kansans declared that they held no
further hopes of Roosevelt's success in
the Republican convention and would
take the matter in their own hands.
The fislit for Roosevelt in the Repub
lican convention however, is just as
serious as at any former stage of the
game.
Delegates to the Republican con
vention were badly at sea today when
the announcement was made that
Roosevelt would go to the third party
with the nomination of Hughes. This

Chicago, June 6. George W. Per

delegates today issued a flat ultima

the presidential nomination, so far as
the Progressives are concerned.
"We have no second choice"
"Go to it," Perkins' statement con
cluded. Coming on the heels of the
meeting of the Progressive in
surgent called by the Mississippi dele
gation last night, the statement of
Perkins created a distinct stir. Per
kins statement follows:
"Let me remind you that we are
not he-re for the avowed purpose of
being against somebody. We are here
for somebody and somebody is Theo
dore Roosevelt. I urge you to bear
this in mind in conversations with
whom so ever you talk, while in Chi
cago. The process of tearing down
men and things in this country and
the world should stop. It is time to
be for somebody for something and
to build up. We haven't got it in for
anybody or anything. We are out for
a matchless man and an incomparable
cause.
No Second Choice.
"Yorj know that no one else has
such a man, and that he is the causa.
Therefore, we have no second choice.
"Go to it."
Perkins was asked if this means no
second choice "now, or from now on."
"Now or any time," was the re
sponse. Added significance was seen in the

BY PERRY ARNOLD.
Chicago, June 6. The inner circles
of Republicanism received George W.
Perkins's "fiat" that it would be
Roosevelt or no one for the Progres
sives as a "home consumption' state
ment today.
They figured Perkins, noting pos
sibility of a stampede among the di
rect action of Progressives In their
convention which would force his
hand on any harmony program with
the Republicans, sought by his care
fully worded statement to hold them
further in check, awaiting the outcome
of negotiations.
The Republican plan of seduction of
Progressives by a stragetic plan of
non-coercion, of open-handedness, of
relegation of the steam roller to the
background,, it was explained, relies
for its success on attracting back to
the fold the greatest possible number
of Progressives. Perkins, the old line
leaders say, realizes his strength In
making demands is contingent on hav
ing as much unity behind him as pos
sible. Third Party Almost Certain.
The G. O. P. inner ring also viewed
with considerable apprehension the
prospect of Perkins not being able to
speak for any united Bull Moose party.
If anything, they were probably a tri
fle more anxicus for unity than Per
kins. The Bull Moose radicals this
afternoon had . practically abandoned
hope of conciliation with the Repub
licans and were agreed that a third

Oyster Bay Friends Say This Is
?few Situation.
New York. June 6. That Theodore
Roosevelt will support General Leon
ard Wood for the Republican nomi
nation if his name comes seriously
before the convention was the news
that reached here today from Oyster
Bay.
It came from one of the colonel s
visitors.
He made the statement to them,
they said, in the course of a general
conversation.
According to the colonel's visitors,
who asked that their names be with
held, Roosevelt believes Wood a man
eminently fitted for the labors that
will devolve upon the next president
of the United States.
The colonel's visitors said that in
the event of the nomination of Wood
he would have the colonel's ardent
support.
Wait on Telephone.
Roosevelt declined to say a word on
the speech of Hughes. After receiv
ing his visitors at Oyster Bay, Roose
velt came to New York, going first
to the office of Scribner's Magazine
and later to his dentist. This after
noon he will be in his office at the
Metropolitan Magazine and later to
the Harvard club to see friends on
business, but not on political busi
ness. He Intends to return to Oyster
Bay and his private telephone line at
five o'clock.
Until this morning Roosevelt has
been at the telephone line constantly
since the installation several days ago.
A secretary took up the vigil when the
colonel left home and throughout the
morning appraised the colonel of the
moves on the political checkerboard at
Chicago.
Friends said that Colonel Roosevelt
had told them that he would "wel
come" the nomination of General
Wood and that he would "throw his
hat in the ring and go out and work
for him" as a candidate who was
"thoroughly United States," and whose
election would mean the "return of
the true spirit of Americanism."

"But It Was Just Little Patri

Senator Lodge as a Compro

(By Assoriated Press)
Chicago, June 6. Political leaders
who profess to be willing to accept
any man for the presidential nomina
tion who is able to command the sup
port of both Republicans and Progres
sives are trying today to determine
whether Justice Hughes has been
strengthened or weakened by the tem
porary concentration of all forces up
on him with the avowed purpose of
eliminating Colonel Roosevelt as a
Republican possibility.
The effect of the Hughes drive has
been to place the whole field of can
didates against him according to some.
Conferences between Republican
and Progressive leaders which lasted
far into the night were resumed early
today, but it was not believed that
any of them had proceeded far enough
to clarify the situation within the next
several hours. At least for that length
of time no decided change seemed
imminent. I - ...
Talk of iixtec.
The two latest elements to be
brought into consideration today were
Justice Hughes' speech in Washington
yesterday touching upon Americanism
and discussion of Senator Lodare of
Massachusetts, as a compromise can
didate for the Republican nomination,
likely to command the support of
Colonel Roosevelt.
Justice Hughes supporters pointed
to his speech as a substantial deelara
tio on the question of Americanism
and contended that it cleared up the

Primary In Florida.
Tampa, Fla., June 6. Florida Dem
ocrats in their party primary today
ballotted for a United States senator,
four congressmen and a complete state
ticket. The voters also expressed their
choice for vice president between Vice
President Thomas R. Marshall and
Governor Elliott W. Major of Missouri.
ATTENTION, REPUBLICANS!
Kansas R. ..ublicans. including the
standpatters who have reached the
conclusion, as so many of them have,
that Theodore Roosevelt is the man of
the hour for the Republican party, can
still play a part bringing about his
nomination, even if they are at home.
All that they need to do is to ac
quaint the members of the Kansas
delegation to the Chicago convention
with the sentiment for Roosevelt that
'exists today among all shades of Re
publicans in Kansas.
This can be done through' the me
dium of "night letters" by wire or
special delivery letters through the
mails addressed to the Kansas dele
gates individually or collectively.
These communications should be ad
dressed to the headquarters of the
delegation, the Auditorium hotel, Chi
cago. And the Kansas Republicans who
are alive to the necessities of the
party and their country can surely do
no less than to communicate in this
fashion to their representatives in the
Chicago convention; and request of
them that, after the early balloting,
they vote for Roosevelt and thereby
express the present sentiment of Kan
sas in respect to the Republican presi
dential nomination.
Stories in certain Kansas newspa
pers from Chicago to the effect that
Roosevelt is already entirely out of
the running are fathered by wishes
and made out of whole cloth, as the
better informed dispatches of the re
liable press associations and other and
more expert political newspaper men,
indicate.
Roosevelt is more in the running for
the Republican presidential nomina
tion than ever before. All that is
needed to make his nomination almost
a certainty is that the delegates to the
convention be Informed rightly of the
preponderance of the sentiment for
him among the rank and file of the
vcters in the party.
Will the Republicans of Kansas fail
to inform their representatives pt Chi
cago of the sentiment that exists in
the Sunflower state today for Theo
dore Roosevelt?
