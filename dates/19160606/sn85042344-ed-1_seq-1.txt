The licpuhli-
an national committee ad-
journed nt
o'clock tonight after
disposing of sixty-two contests for
(.cats in the convention. During the
last four hours of the four days' ses
sion the most interesting decisions
were made. They included :
Refusal to lace on the temporary
roll of the convention any memliers
of the three contesting delegations
from the District of Columbia.
Sent! m; of both delegations from
l-oulsiina, each rnemler with half a
vote, and roiUosHng the delegation
to select Armand Romaine of New
Orleans national oi.iiuitteeinan in
idace of Victor Rniscl.
Decision that the committee on
resolutions he asked to receive dele
gations from the suffrage convention
nml conference and from prepared
ness organi.at ions.
A inot'on to reconsider the ruling
of the committee in the sixth (ikla
Jionia district wan (aided. In this
district two delegates of the MoGratv
taction were seated over two ad
herents of J. A. Harris, national com
mitteeman. The selection of a new national
committeeman is said to hinge on
the makeup of the state delegations.
and the J. J. Mc'iraw faction assert
that with the Sixth thsriot they have
vote to elect McGraw In place of
Committeeman HaTis.
Mr. Harris cxpref-Hcd his determi
nation to take the contest in the Sixth
district hefore the credentials com
mittee with a plea that his delegates
lie given places on the. permanent
roll.
Contest Is Bit lor.
The Titstrlct of Colombia contest
was bitterly fought ami an extension
of time was given each of the three
contesting delegations in which to
present their evidence. The delega
tion hended liy Frank -1- llogan of
Washington, I). C. claimed a right to
peats In the convention from the fact
that It received a majority of he
Totes east at a primar election called
by a committee appointed hv the na
tional committee.
The delegation headed hy Aaron
Itradshatv charged that the primary
election was not authorized hv the na
tional committee and therefore was
Illegal. A convention was held a'ter
the -.Tlmary election at which this
delegation was selected.
Charged Friiml.
A third set of delegates, headed by
Tiohrtl I Miller, charge,! that the
primary election was tiermeated with
fraudulent voting and that the pri
mary officials were Intimated hy the
followers of llogan. It was argued
for this contingent that it received a
majority of the votes in the precincts
In which no charges of fraud were
made. Successive motions were made
to scat the loi'.an and l'.radshuw dele
Rations, l'olh motions were wiih
drawn and l'red W. Kstabrook of New
Hampshire male a motion that none
of the contestants receive seats lie

ods of electing delegates anil as a pre
ventive of further contests from the

hardly a disserting vote. The district
was to have had two scats in the con

orders to proceed immediately to New

hundred and six hundred additional
marines for Santo Domingo. Most of
the marines will tie drawn from Pa

The general situation In Santo
Domingo is regarded as most unfa

necessary to restore order will bo sent
there by the, Cnitcd States.
Dominican rebels who fled from
Puerto Plata and Monte Chrlstl at the
approach of American marines have
strongly entrenched themselves out
side of the latter town. A dispatch to
the state department today from Min
ister llussell at Santo Domingo, gave
further details of the occupation of
the town and Indicated that the situa
tion on the island was more serious
than had been believed here.
A paraphrase of the minister's mes
sage follows:
"After 21 hours' notice, marines
were landed on June 1 at Monte
Christ! and Puerto Plata. The fort at
Puerto Plata was occupied after re
sistance of two hours. tine marine
officer probably fatally wounded. Port

General Carranza's demand that

considerable discussion in diplomatic
circles. Some diplomats do nut hesi

They argue that the fact that Amer

cently in Nicaragua, Haiti ami the
Dominican republic and that Ameri

have been used by such agents to dis

assert that a campaign is on foot lt

A Statement Concerning Circulation
In December of last year the Democrat Joined the Audit ltiireau of
Circulation, a national organization including nost of the largist papers
of the country. A representative of this burtai. W. H. Wi lier, a very
capable man, was in Tulsa a good part of last month. He made no
audit of the Democrat because the Dcmocmt nad no report In the hands
of the bureau to audit. These reports nre made at the end ol each
quarter ending April 1. July 1. Oi tuber 1 and January 1. The Demo
crat has usked for and has been promised an audit In July.
Mr. Walter Is an expert accountant having been in the employ o:'
the government for many years in very responsible positions. He gave
the Democrat a complete system of re olds '.vh'eh are now being carefully

they are urged to come to the ol flee and e xamine In connection with the
statement of circulation carried on the editorial page, each day, and of

4 p. m.
This record as l ow kept will show when cars of paper are bought,
how much they weigh an I tust how Ihir pi per Is all used. It will shot.
postage and express paid and all money received on circulation from
evry source. It is a record so complete and In such detail that it Is im
possible to deceive any one if it was a'toinptcd.
The Democrat now has a standing order for a cr of paper every
three weeks and a barrel ol ink everv month. It guarantees what it
carries on its editorial page or It will rebate any advertiser In proportion.
Jt will submit to any examination of Its recorda and Its circulation by
anyone.
This examination will be made by the Audit Bu
reau in July. When this audit is made it will be
printed in full in The Democrat and The Democrat
will abide by the consequences of that audit.
The Democrat has not sought and Is not seek ng any controversy
with anyone over this matter. Prvious t Mr. Walter's v'sit Its circu
