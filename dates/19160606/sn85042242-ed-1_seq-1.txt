Marmath Man, Released From

Office-
T. Carbury of Marmarth has been
pardoned by the state board of par­
dons. This action was taken after
many prominent people of the state
had requested it and no one had pro­
tested.
Mr. Carbury was sent to the peni­
tentiary some five years ago, on a
"charge of murder. A man was killeJ
in an altercation and two men were
convicted for the deed, although the
testimony clearly showed that only
one man could have done the act.
His record at the penitentiary has
been excellent.
He is now employed in the gover­

Is Shown Up in Three
Reports.
DR. STRAUSS APPEARS
BEFORE COMMISSION
Three reports from different labor­
atories presented to the city commis­
sion last evening exploded the at­
tempt Joseph Winslow, bacteriologist
of the local branch laboratory of the
health department of the state univer­
sity, to injure the high rating of the
city's water supply. Ever since Mr.
WinsloW's arrival he has made a sys­
tematic, campaign •.agftlnsf the water
supply. Last 'evening, in the face of
reports from leading bacteriologists,
he admitted the falsity of former re­
ports by turning in an analysis of the
city water in essential features simi­
lar to the ones received from other
authorities.
Dr. Strauss, city health commission­

sion and explained the reports. He
stated that a sample of water taken

Hot Springs, Ark., June 5.—At least

late today and ployed through the

TORNADO DOES DAMAGE
AT BALD KNOB
Memphis, Tenn., June 5.—A dis­

office here from Bald Knob, Ark., re­
ported that several persons were kill­
ed and considerable property damage
was done in White county by a tor­
nado which swept through central Ar­
kansas today. A special train left

many are said to be injured, carrying
physicians and nurses. Orders were
issued for another train to proceed

Reports Differ Greatly.
It also developed that the chemists
to which the water was sent gave the
number of colonies in the water as
high as 11,000. In one report Wins­
low gave the colonies as only 25
which either brands him as dishonest
or completely incompetent to make
analysis.
Three samples of the city water
were gathered sometime ago in the
presence of H. T. Murphy of the Wat­
er Works company, Dr. Strauss, city
health officer, and Mr. Winslow. They
were sealed up and taken to the ex­
press office and sent to laboratories
secretly as far as Mr. Murphy and
Mr. Winslow were concerned until
Mr. Winslow by stealth entered the
local express office and read the lab­
els on the containers.
Three Samples Sent.
One sample was sent to the health
laboratory at Wisconsin university.
This point was selected for it is here
that Mr. Winslow secured his train­
ing. Another was sent to the Beebe
laboratory at St. Paul, one of the best
bacteriological laboratories of
4
the
northwest. A third sample was sent
to the city health laboratory of St.
Paul.
No one but Strauss and Winslow
knew the destination of the contain­
ers. The reports all agree that the
water is free from pollution and give
the lie to the reports given monthly
by Mr. Winslow who has been deter­
mined to create the impression that
Missouri river water is unfit. He has
been assisted in his crusade by a few
disgruntled, physicians.
Winslow Becomes Active.
When the river was frozen four
feet deep and the possibilities for con­
tamination were about one in a mil­
lion, Winslow, was sending in vicious
reports upon the water.
As soon as he learned that the city
health officer was suspicious, Mr.
Winslow became exceedingly active.
He traced the destination of the
samples and evidently learned, the
conclusions of the chemists for his re­
port filed last evening with the three
others is as different from his others
as night is from,day. Mr. Winslow
did not appear in person to explain
his sudden reversal.
The entire matter has been referred
to Mr. Chris Bertsch, commissioner
of water works.

PLAN TO PAVE
C*p CITY
Objections Based Chiefly on Fear
of the Cost of Improve.
ment.
REGISTER AND HIS
BROTHER ARE HEARD
Every Step to Be Taken to Safe­
guard the Property
Owners.
Less than fifteen tax payers appear­
ed before the city commission last
evening to rppose paving in the resi­
dence districts. Petitions have been
tiled with the city commission repre­
senting fifty-four per cent of the prop­
erly owners and it is upon this show­
ing that the city commission is pro­
ceeding with the preliminary work.
City Engineer Atkinson lias not
prepared the ordinances as yet, but it
is believed that the first steps can be
taken at the next meeting to set in)
motion the much-needed improve­
ment.
Wiil Ascertain Cost First.
Tht property owners appearing last
evening were assured that no steps
would be taken until the tax pay­
ers were fully advised of the cost
of the improvement. Most, of those
who objectod did so from a fear that
the improvement would! exceed the
estimates of the city engineer.
Before any bids are let, however,
ample opportunity will be given for
the property owners to know tho ex­
act, co*U- A. meeting-of the TuuJmwf)
men's committee named by the Com­
mercial club has been held and IS. A.
Hughes, its chairman, announced yes­
terday that the business interests
will support the paving committee
headed by R. C. Battey. Mr. Battey
met with this committee and explain­
ed the tentative plans.
Quotes Mandan. Figures.
H. Register was spokesman last
evening before the city commission.
He quoted Mandan figures on costs
and asserted that these costs applied
to property here might make the im­
provement confiscation of property,
but City Engineer Atkinson remarked
that Mandan must be well satisfied
when it decided a few weeks ago to
put in thirty-six more blocks of pav­
ing, taking in several residence
streets.
Mr. Register also suggested that
before anything was done that the
property owners be given an idea as
to the total cost. As Mayor Lucas
explained, the intention is to take all
the property owners into the commis­
sion's confidence and apprise them of
each and every step.
Addresses similar in vein to that
made by Mr. Register were given by
George Register, Dr. Fisher, Arthur
Van Horn and S. M. Ferris.
The first step toward preparing for
paving was taken last evening when
an ordinance was placed on first read­
ing requiring all roof drains to be dis­
connected from the sanitary sewers.
These must be drained through con­
nections with the storm sewers.

Consider the Epistle.
Washington, .June 5.—President
Wilson and his cabinet are expected
to discuss at tomorrow's meeting the
reply to be sent to Gen. Carranza's
note demanding withdrawal of troops
from Mexico. While it has been stat­
ed authoritatively that the reply will
make clear the administration's de­
termination not to withdraw the
troops until Carranza troops have
shdtvn their ability to prevent raids,
there are other questions raised by
the note which must be considered.
Gen. Carranza's demand that the
United States declare its intention
toward Mexico "in the interest of all
Latin-America," has aroused consid­
erable discussion in diplomatic circles.
Some diplomats do not hesitate to at­
tribute it to the foreign diplomats at
Mexico City, working ofr a closer
Pan-American relationship.
State department officials refused
to discuss the possibility and the re­
ply President Wilson will make to the
demands for new expression of dis­
interest has not been indicated. The
demand may be ignored entirely as
other portions of the note, such as
that suggesting that American poli­
tics are behind the action of the
United States.

DEFEATED IN IOWA
Late Returns Indicate Amend­
ment Lost by a Heavy
Vote.
Des Moines, la.. .une 5.—'When the
polls closed tonisht, indications were
that an unusually heavy vote had
been cast in the primaries. There
was a belief that the governorship
might go to the republican conven­
tion, which meets in July. Candidates
for state offices on the democratic
ticket had no opposition.
Officers of the Iowa Equal Suffrage
association claimed a victory for the
amendment by a fair margin. They
said |hey expected their great
strength to develop in the rural dis­
tricts. "Opponents of the cause"
were equally confident that it was in
the rural districts that the amend
men would be defeated.
William L. Harding of Sioux City
was the choice of the republican vot­
ers of the state for governor, accord­
ing to tonight's returns. It was ad­
mitted that later returns might af­
fect the total, but Harding was be­
lieved to have a sufficient lead to in­
sure his nomination without recourse
to the republican state couvention,
in July.
Wloman's suffrage seems to have
been overwhelmingly defeated, ac­
cording to returns.

The long expected offensive of the
Russians against the Teutonic allies
seemingly has begun. From both Pe

the Russians are actively engaged
over a front from Strippa river, east
of Brest Litovsk, to the (Roumanian
frontier—a distance of about 250
miles.
Russians everywhere are using
large numbers of guns and men, and
according to Petrograd have achieved
successes on a number of sectors.
They have captured Teuton positions
and destroyed guns and ammunition.
Shell Long Front.
Along the Bessarabian front, in the
Dniester region along the lower Strip
pa and in the Volhynia, attacks by
the Russians have been particularly
violent, in the region of Olyk, in the
zone of the Volhynian fortress trian­
gle, the Russians have shelled a front
of more than iiO miles in length, held
by the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand.

Around Vaux and Damloup, bombard­
ments on both sides have continued
with intensity, while to the west of
the iMeuse the shelling has been most­
ly intermittent.
On the remainder of the fronts in
France, except around Ypreu, the sit­
uation is reported quiet. About Ypres,
liowever, the Germans and Canadi­
ans are continuing the violent fight­
ing that has been in progress since
last week, when the Germans, under
a continued rain of shells, captured
Canadian positions, which resulted in
a hand to hand encounter.
Force Back Canadians.
Returning to the attack Sunday,
the Germans forced the Canadians to
relinquish the bulk of the recaptured
ground, but the Canadians are disput­
ing strenuously the efforts of the Teu­
tons to oust them from the remain­
der of the positions.
Rome admits the retirement of the
Italians in the Cengio zone, but says
that in Dalgone valley, Langarise val­

heavy losses.
DELEGATES FLOCK TO

Chicago, June 5.—Delegates to the
republican national convention pour­

it was estimated that very few vere
not on the ground.
Many delegations came quietly and
sought their hotels without display,
but the few that borught brass bands
and banners, and wore badges of fav­
orite sons gave a touch of color, and
something of a holiday air to pre-con*
vention day.
The lobbies of the hotels, where
most of the delegates stopped, were
cleared for action earlier, and even
couches were removed to save places,
and tonight there Was nothing on the
floors but a mass of delegates.

Chicago, June 5.—History for wom­
en was in the making tonight, when
the first Woman's party was drawn
under the auspices of the Convention
for Woman's suffrage. The night
meeting followed the day meeting,
marking the three-day convention
here in an effort to fjromote their
cause and induce progressives and re­

their platform, and obtain an endorse­
ment of the Susan B. Anthony amend­
ment to the constitution.

Away.
MURDERED WIFE

Krieiul of Abraham Lincoln, John
Henry, a negro, who as nearly as can
be ascertained, had reached his hun­
dredth anniversary, died yesterday at.
the state penitentiary. The only
cause of his death was old age.
John Henry, was a peaceful, hard­
working negro. Before the Civil war
lie was a Southern slave. During the
was he became acquainted with Abra­
ham Lincoln and Warden Talcott,
friend of all the prisoners, used to sit
for hours and listen to the stories of
Uncle Abe, told in the quaint, broad
'brogue of John Henry.

After the war he moved to 3rand
Forks, where lie worked
-for
one of
,tbfi early-c^jdL!t^i.o}:a,£l
6sI. and industrious?. Soon lie liatl a
home and money in the bank.
Then something got the best, of
him. The peaceful, hard-working
John Henry murdered his wife.
The money in the bank went for
attorney's fees. The house was sold.
Rut John Henry,

committed to
the penitentiary.
"He was perfectly harmless," sA.\*s
Warden Talcott. "He had never been
in any trouble before. And he has
been faithful ever since lie was com­
mitted to the penitentiary for life.
A Carload a Day.
"Long after he was 90 years old he
unloaded his carload of coal a day. Tt
was easy to see how pleased he was
when 4 o'clock would come and he
would have his car of coal unloaded
while the two tenderfeet assigned to
the next car by a deputy would still
have half a load.
"He has been failing for the last
three months. Old age got the bet­
ter of him. But. he was faithful to
the end."
Thus the friend of Lincoln and an
early builder of North Dakota, the
old Southern slave, passed away.
FUG FIRST SAYS
JUSTICE HUGHES
Presidential Possibility Gives Op­
ening Address to Stud­
ents.
Washington, June 5.—In the seclu­
sion of the National Cathedral school
lawn, where he was presenting a flag
to the graduates, Justice Charles
Hughes made his opening speech. He
told the graduates that the flag meant
America first.
"This flag means more than asso­
ciations and reward," said the justice.
"It is the symbol of our national uni­
ty, our national endeavors, and our
national operations, it tells you of
the struggle for independence, of
union preserved, and of liberty and
union, one and inseparable, of the
sacrifices of brave men and women to
whom the high ideals of this nation
have been dearer than life.
"It means America first."
Under the custom of the school,
the student who stands at the head
of the class receives as a right the
flag which has flown over the school
ground all year. Miss Catherine
Hughes, daughter of the justice, was
a member of the graduating class,
but she missed the coveted honor of
winning the flag by a few points

The District of Columbia contest
was bitterly fought and an extension
vof time was given the three contest­
ing delegations in which to present
evidence. The delegation headed by

claimed a right to seats in the con­
vention from the fact that it received
a majority of the votes cast at tho
primary election called by the com
tee appointed by the national commit­
tee.
Primary Election Disputed.
The delegation headed by Warren
Bradshaw charged that the primary
election was not authorized by the
national committee. A convention
was held after the primary election
at which this delegation was selected.
A third set of delegates, headed by
Robert I. Miller, charged that the
primary election was permeated with,
fraudulent motives and that the prim­
ary officials were intimidated by tho
followers of Hogan. It was argued
for this contingent that it received a
majority of the votes in the precincts
in which no charges of fraud were
made.

haps of a hundred delegates from
