Any Survivors
By United Pross. -London,
Juno fi. Lord , Kitchener,
minister of war, with bis entire Btaft,
was lost when the bait lu cruiser Hamp
shire was sunk off tho north coast of
Scotland, it was officially announced
by tho admiralty thl morning ,
Tho statement Issued by the adjjkl
ralty indicated that the Hampsulrn
was torpedoed off the Orkney Islands.
It was indicated that there was little
hope that uny .members of Kitchen
er's staff survived and it Is accepted
as a fact that Kitchener himself was
drowned. ' ' ' ' 1 ' ." " "' ;
The Hampshire was a battle cruiser
of the (Argyll typa, ourryl ,g ti.'jj 'offi
cers and men. It was four hundred
feet long, displacing 10,S.0 ton.'. Its
armament consisted of six 6-inch guns
and two torpedo tubes.
Cable dispatches did not , mention
the Hampshire as participating iu the
great naval battle last week aid. did
not indicate the circumstance under
which the vessel wn sunk, : !.
Lord Kitchener was liiiKlantl' forfl
most soldier since the death of Lord
Roberts.
The main base of the British high
seas, fleet is believed to be In. the ri
cmltv of the islands off the north
I coast of Scotland and It is therefore
I thought that Kitchener and hi taff
went there to review the yaf(61s that
engaged the Germans last Wtlk, prob
ably conferring with other high offi
cials. . ; ' r .
Kitchener was respbnible for the
defense of England in cuse of attempt
ed Invasion.
The official statement said th
Hampshire was either torpedoed or
destroyed by a mine. , . r , ,
The statement Issued by tUe admir
alty was as follows:
"The admiralty reports with deep
regret that the Hampshire was sunk
about 8 o'clock last night off the Ork
ney islands wHh Lord Kitchener and
-taff on board by a mine or torpedo.
"Four boats were set;), leaving the
ship with heavy seas running but pa
trol boats and destroyers rushed to
tho scene. No reports have been re
ceived yet from searching parties on
shore."
England's greatest personal los in
the war stunned London. It was learn
ed this 'afternoon that Kitchener and .
his staff were en route to Russia, In
tending to confer with high official
at Petrograd.
Admiral Jelltcoe reported the loss
of the Hampshire to' the admiralty.
