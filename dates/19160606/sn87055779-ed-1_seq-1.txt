Ask Each Convention to Name Committee of
Six to Arrange Union Roosevelt
Men Stick to Their Guns.
CHICAGO, June 6. Justice of the Supreme Court Charles
Evans Hughes will be nominated as the republican candidate for
president unless some unforeseen contingency arises between now
and Friday.
Col. Theodore Roosevelt will be asked again to be the stand
ard bearer of the progressives. Unless the progressive party lead
ers are able during the next two days to regain control of their
delegates the colonel will be nominated with or without his con
sent. The question of whether he would accept will have no bear
ing on the mass of the delegates now here who are angered through
and through over the failure of the republicans to accept the indi
vidual, whom, they claim, typifies the issues cf the day.
These were the outstanding developments this afternoon of
a turbulent day filled with frantic conferences between the repre
sentatives of the various wings of the two parties. George W.
Perkins is ready to accept Hughes and will so inform Col. Roose
velt. But the radicals of the progressive movement, headed by
Gov. Hiram Johnson of California, and Victor Murdock of Kansas,
will have none of this plan. They came into the open today as
determined to insist on the progressive national convention nominating-
Col. Roosevelt and then serving notice that they would ac
cept no other candidate.
CHICAGO, June 6. The only definite movement toward
harmony between the republican and progressive conventions was
taken by the New Jer-ey republican delegation in caucus today at
a time when the breach between the two bodies seemed widest.
Hamilton F. Kean, introduced a resolution asking that the re
publican convention appoint a committee of six to meet with a
similar committee of the progressive convention with a view to
bringing unity of action if possible.
The resolution was adopted by the delegation without a dis
senting vote.
A second resolution was then adopted to present the original
resolution to the convention when it convenes.

builders settled down to a series of
informal conferences' today to per
fect the declaration of faith upon
which the republican candidate,

more meat was the general idea of

COLONEL SEES II
DEEPER MEANING
Says Hughes Speech is Only
What Any True Amer
ican Would Say.
J ttt -'I'lia t 1'Ujm! News Servie:
NE W VOKK, June ;. "I see
nothing in it that calls for discus
sion. What Justice Hughes said was
nothing mote than would he said hy
any man who has his country at
heart."
This was the only expression of
i pinion that Col. Kosevelt would
make 'w hen asked today to c omment
upon the "America first" speech of
Justice Charles E. Hughes before the
National Cathedral school in Wash
ington. Visitor who saw Col. Koo.-evelt
;:t Oyster bay declared that the
colonel is ready to toss his hat into
the ring and work heart and soul for
Gen. Leonard Wood if the republi
cans will nominate him for presi
dent. Col. Koosevelt regards Gen.
Wood as the ideal candidate and the
living exponent of Americanism and
preparedness.
"Gol. Koosevelt is not a candidate
for the presidential nomination
through any selfish desire for the
job," said one of the visitors. "He
feels that he has the force to put
into action certain ideas on pre
laredness for the safeguarding of
the nation. Perhaps the colonel
would rather have Gen. Leonard
Wood nominated than himself, lie
admires Wood and believes he would
make an ideal president. The others
mentioned in connection with the
romination represent only platforms.
Wood represents living action spent
in behalf of his country. The colonel
believes that the people feel the
tame way about it."
A private wire has been installed
1 etween Sagamore Hill the colonel's
home at Oyster Hay, and Chicago,
by means of which Col. Koosevelt
will be kept in immediate touch with
all that goes on in the convention

New York Central Files Re
monstrance to Works
Board Resolution.
Indications are that the New
York Ceuti:,.l railroad company
will make a bitter lisht against the
track elevation resolution parsed by
the hoard of works recently. A
remonstrance against the action was
filed by Atty. Dinnen Tuesday morn
ing with the board while a request
for a continuance of the hearing
until June til was granted.
The remonstrance asserts that the
elevation of the tracks will destroy
all side track connections and injure
business here. It also asserts that
the order takes the property without
just eompensation and that the
grades provided in the order will
not permit the company to maintain
its present service. It is stated that
the elevation will not allow the
company to connect with its freight
depot on Scott and Chapin sts. The
remonstrance declared that the
hoard of works does not have the
authority to issue the order.
The board conducted a hearing on
the granting of the contract for the
pavin-' of Mishawaka av. and Lddy
st. Advocates of various kinds of
asphalt were before the boi.nl. The
hearing continued until noon and
the board decided to make its final
decision on the question at tonicht's
meeting.

LONDON, June 6. The British cruiser Hampshire
on which Lord Kitchener and his staff were on their way
to Russia, has been sunk off the Scottish coast by a mine
or a German submarine.
Search was made for survivors, but none was found.
Official announcement of the destruction of the Hamp

The following official report was made:
"The admiralty reports with deep regret that the ship
Hampshire with Lord Kitchener and his staff on board was
sunk last night about 8 o'clock off the Orkney islands, by
a mine or a torpedo.
"'Four boats were seen by observers on the shore to leave the
ship.
"Heavy seas were running, but patrol vessels and destroyers
at once proceeded to the scene.
"At the same time a party was sent along the shore to search
for bodies. Only a capsized boat had been found up to the time
of the issuance of this report.
"The whole shore had been searched frcm the seaward, but
it is greatly feared that there is little hope for any survivors. No
report has yet been received from the search party on shcre. The
Hampshire was proceding to Russia."
Hope that Lord Kitchener, the
war secretary, and his staff escaped
death when the cruiser Hampshire
was sunk last nitrht by a mine or
submarine, was practically abandon
ed this evening".

Scottish coast ever since (he Hamp
