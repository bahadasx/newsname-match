—Lodge Being Discussed.
Special to Times-Republican,
Chicago, June 6.—Iowa delegates in
conference definitely decided not to
involve themselves in caucuses with
old guard leaders who are pushing
booms for Root, Weeks, Burton and
others. They hope the Roosevelt
forces will take Cummins as their
second choice and that the effect of
this will^be to force the old guard
to line up for the Iowa man. Sen
ator Kenyort' today saw George W.
Perkins and'sought the support of
the Roosevelt men for Cummins, It
is believed the Roosevelt'men on
the whole prefer Cummins as sec
ond choice.' Kentucky and some
southern states are developing
Cummins support.
Special to Times-Republican.
•Chicago, June 6.—The Cummins can
didacy today is atill waiting patiently
outside the big scrap tor the apple to
roll out .under the canvas. It is un
true that Roosevelt has said that he
would not accept Hughes, altho the
Roosevelt leaders do not want Hughes.
However, Hughes will be nominated
unless the J&oosevelt leaders fore a
compromise. 'If there is to be a com
promise, the Iowa man is believed to be
first choice with Roosevelt leaders. So
far suggestion of his name has met
with refusal from bosses. They want
one of their own kind and would name
him were it npt for the fear of a third
party ticket. JToday the game of bluff

Chicago, -June 6.—Political leaders
who profess to be willing to accept any
man for the presidential nomination
who is able to command support of
both republicans and progressives w«»re
trying today to determine whether Jus
tice Hughes had been strengthened or
weakened by the concentration of all
forces upon him with the avowed pur
pose of removing Roosevelt as a candi
date.
Unquestionably the Hughes drive has
been to place .the whole field of candi
dates against him.
Conferences between republican and
progressive leaders which lasted far in
to the night were resumed today but it
was not believed any of them had pro
ceeded far enough to clarify the situa
tion.
Talk Lodge as Compromise.
The two latest elements to be brought
into consideration today were Justice
Hughes' speech in Washington yester
day touching on Americanism} and dis
cussion of Senator Lodge as a compro
mise candidate for the republican nom
ination likely to command the support
of Colonel Roopevelt.
The Hughes supporters pointed to his
speech as a substantial declaration ot
his principles and declared it cleared
up the only issue on which the justice
had not previously announced his atti
tude. They contended that his utter
ances before .he went on the supreme
court bench, made clear his position on
all paramount issues,
Progressives Keep Them Guessing.
Almost overshadowing the maneuver
ing among republicans today is the
Question as to what the progressive
convention will do. The republicans
regard it as charged with possibilities
of the most potent sort. On every hand
they expect a tremendous demonstration
for Colonel Roosevelt, despite efforts in
some quarters to hold back a nomina
tion until the republicans have indi
cated their purpose.
A movement for a delay in tha pro
gressive convention, however, has been
met by a declaration of the leaders to
have immediate action or at least not
later than Thursday.
Moose Leaders Oppose Delay.
Victor Murdoek, Henry James Allen,
of Kansas, Hiram Johnson. Gifford Pin
chot and about thirty others at a con
ference came to a decision that the
convention should nominate Colonel
Roosevelt as soon as nominations could
be reached and that nothing less than
a request for a delay from Colonel
Roosevelt should interfere with that
plan.' The movement for the ispnsdiato
nomination of Roosevelt began to show
early today. The progressives opened
headquarters in the Florentine room of
the Congress Hotel.
Before the delegates were at break
fast Roosevelt boosters abroad,
cheering, shouting and stirring up dem~
onslratlons for the colonel. This was
part of the. plan matured at secret con
ferences. At first it was intended to is
sue a statement declaring for the im
mediate nomination of the colonel at
the convention but It was finally deter
mined that no statement would be
{hade.
Progressive leaders striving for har
mony realize th'e difficulty in prevent
ing the nomination of Roosevelt beyond
Thursday.
Many Conferences Held.
Many conferences have been held
between groups of republicans and pro
gressives. At the outset the regular re
puMicans were inclined to offer the en
fcire ltfet of candidates now in the field

off until the progressives show a wil

The suggestion of Senator Lodge is
believed to have been the result of this
broad criticism of progressives' course,
The republicans were not disposed to

The mentfton of Mr. Lodg*e led to the
disclosure that at a- conference Sunday
night progressives offerevd the name of
Senator LaFollette and asked the re
publicans if they would support him.
The republicans charged the progress
ives with insincerity.
The progressives had more to say
today about the Hughes speech than
did the Hughes men themselves.
"I do- not care to interpret Justice
Hughes' speech," said Frank H. Hitch
cock. "It speaks for itself. If I were
the manager of a candidate's campaign
I might have much to say."
Progressive leaders after carefully
studying the speech professed to at

Roosevelt.
"Nice Little Flag Speech."
"It was a ndce little flag speech,
eminently proper for delivery before a
girls' seminary but does not further

vital issues before this convention."
said Chester Rowell, a progressive
from California.
John McGrath, Colonel Roosevelt's
secretary, reiterated today that the
colonel had no present Idea of coming
to Chicago.

Immediately before he went Into
conference with republican leaders,
George W. Perkins, leader of the
Roosevelt forces, today gave out the
statement declaring that Colonel
Roosevelt had pot said he would re

other man. and assailed the Hughes
supporters for. making capital of his
"preparedness' 'speech ln Washington
last night.
"Colonel Roosevelt has neither said
he was for or against any man." iMr.
Perkins said. "When he does speak
it will be over his own signature. I
am amazed that persons are taking
advantage of Justice Hughes' speech
before a girls' college to get him the
nomination for the president. Who
ever tries to use this statement to get
the nomination places him ln an in

"I wish you would be so good as to

Mr. Perkins Issued a state­

tary of state for war on Aug. 18, 1914.
a few days after Great Britain's dec
laration of war on Germany. He was
regarded as England's greatest soldier
and the decision of tho government to
entrust him with supreme direction of
the war was received by unanimous ap
proval.
As the war progressed and Great Bri
tain's deficiency in certain directions
became apparent Earl Kitchener was
subjected to severe criticism, led oy
Lord Northellffe. Tho secretary was
charged with responsibility for failure
to foresee the extraordinary dernun.l
for heavy shells and as a result the
ministry of munitions was formed with
David Lloyd George at its head.
Karl Kitchener's responsibilities were
further lessened by the appointment ot
Gen. Sir William Robertson as chief of
the Imperial staff in December of last
year. It was reported at that time that
friotion had arisen between Earl Kitch
ener and Field Marshal French, then in
command of British forces in Franc*).
Shortly after the appointment of Gen
eral Robertson, Field Marshal Frenc.1
relinquished his command.
Criticism Subsides.
Notwithstanding the criticism di
rected against Earl Kitchener his great
accomplishments In the war are rec
ognized universally. Foremost of his
achievements Is creating from Eng
land's untrained manhood of a huge
army. At the beginning of the war
Great Britain had only a few hundred
thousand trained men. Today more
than 5,000,000 are enrolled for servloe.

Organized Volunteer Army.
Of soveral things that entitle
Earl Kitchener to a place in the
world history, the most notable is that
1
he organized the largest volunteer
army the world has ever seen, In the
greatest war of all times.
Within a year from the sudden out
break of the European war In August,
l»14, the ranks of British lighting men
were quadrupled By an Increase from^j!
less than 1,000,000 to nearly 4,000,000. j.r
All other great powers that entered**'
the war had huge standing armies and^^
compulsory military service. Great
Britain alone faoed the issue with con
fldence that Its people would readily
respond to the call of king and coun- §||j
try without compulsion .and the pre-j
cipltous developments that led to the
war found both the people and the"
government unanimous In the verdict
that Kitchener of Khartum was the *.
man to lead ln the recruiting and or-^
ganlzation of the necessary army.
It was not a sentimental clamor, for
tho Kitchener was a proven hero of,
many campaigns, his personality was
as impenetrable as hardened' steet, and?'?}
he was not a hero that could be loved: '''.J
even the war office had no pronounced

He grimly told the British people,

than they realized, and ono that might
last longer than they expected, but It

humanized machine, set about to make

Into Whitehall street when he made
numerous changes In the personnel of
the war office, which was said to be
honeycombed with social and political
favoritism.
After dispatching a few hundred*
regulars to France and Belgium to,
help check the onrushing Germans, the'
war secretary began recruiting and
organizing his army of millions. The
British Isles were covered with signs
H.nd posters urging young men to Join
the colors. Kitchener went thru the
country superintending the drilling of
the army. From time to time were
reports indicating his failure to get
the number of men he wanted, but
within a year after the war opened
Premier Asquith officially announced
In Parliament that about 3,000,000 men
had enlisted in the United Kingdom
alone, and almost another million ln
the overseas dominions. *,s'
