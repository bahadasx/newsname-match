1 get thl.i from 8,-nator Reed Smoot,
from representatives of Senator Boies
Penrose, from every member of tha
old guard, or representative of an old
guard man, now here, excepting only
Bill Barnes of New York, and some of
them say they will make Bill issuo a
statement putting himself In line with
the rest before the convention opens.
The old guard has but 'wo desires. .

the republican party.
Only One Juotlon Asked.
This Is tho exact spot where the U
stie lies between Justice C. E. Hughes
and Colonel Roosevelt. It Is felt that
Hughes could be eluded. Rut Hughe
is not an organization man and it In
feared he never would become one.
Roosevelt always was un organization
man. Therefore, give the organiza
tion assurance that ItO'iievelt can !n
elected and Roosevelt is tho nominee.
The Roosevelt speeches about, the
country have hi-efi delivered for tha -purpos,,
of giving that assurance. Tha
concentration of Roosevelt leagues lu

nnce.
The favorite- sons will not Inst a
minutti In case the Roosevelt assur
anee can be put across with weight to
carry conviction.
Think Hughe Can Win.
If the conviction cannot he carriod,
if, as a Hughes delegate paid yester
day, "it Is good politics to tak
Hughes, for with him we would avoid
ol, antagonisms, w0 offer u man of
presidential size und we capitalize tho
German-American vote, then Roose
velt will go down with a hard bump
and Hughes will be- nominated."
Nowhere can you find a respectable
body of neutral .sentiment that deals
seriously wilh tho chance of a favor
ite yon.
11 tig lies position?
' Justice lliurh,.-s' position, according
lo the Tribune, with reference to thu
party, was outlined here Saturday.
The information eutne from one not
a po'Pb -inn nor a newspaperman
who oiiiie ut the Blackstone from
Washincion, expecting to remain in
Chicago as an observer of tho conven
tion proceedings.
In short It is as follows:
Justice Hugnes will accept the nom
ination for president If it is tendcrod
to him by th,. repuMliyn uatlonal
coin entioo.
Justice Hughes will make no stste
iiii nt of any kind' to any person except
it b, to his brother justices, prior to
th.- final lotion of the convention.
Justice Hughes will not resign from
the supreme bench before or subse
quent to his nomination.
Justice Hughes will not resign froni
the supremo bench if hp is elected,
until the moment that he Is about to
tike the oath of office on March 4,

Justice Hughes is not a Candidate

fers to remain iiv tho supreme court,
but will do no overt act to promoba
or retard any movement that may 19
