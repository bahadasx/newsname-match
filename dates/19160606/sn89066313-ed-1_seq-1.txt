Earl N. Kurtz Answers Crit
icisms That I lave Been
Made Recently.
WOULD BE EFFICIENT
Most Blazes Small Enough
for Chemicals Pumping
Engine Unnecessary.
Fin- Chief i:.irl X. Kurtz is much
displeased i cr tlio adveise criticism
rol.it i vi to the suggestion that the
riH purchase a e hief's regulation mo
tor car. with (liemic.il tanks affiel.
A motor car of the tpe suggested
bv the lui'f has been on exhibit in
Columbia for the last two weeks. The
Cit Council probabl will take action
on the recommendation this evening
Chief Kurtz replies to the criticisms
as follows:
1 The money that the chemical
wagon would tost should be used in
lengthening the cit mains and put
ting in more plugs.
"The mone for putting in mains
and plugs must come out of the wa
ter and light fund. I realize the need
of more extensive mains and more
plugs and hae recommended that ac
tion. It is up to the water and light
department to make that improvement
and use its own funds. There is plenty
of moue in that department's fund
to pa for that improvement, and the
fire depirtment has the tnoncj to buy
the (hemlcal car."
I ire Ungiiic Not "Nccossarv.
2 A fire engine should be bought
instead of a chemical wagon.
"The State Insurance Commission
last summer recommended certain im
provements bj which this city could
better its classification. The insur
ance rates of a citj are lowered as the
classification of the fire department is
raised Among other things, the com
mission suggested that another pump
be installed at the pumping station,
considering this more practical for
Columbia than the pumping engine
The addition to the station is nearly
oin pitted, and a new pump will be
installed in the near future. The pres
sure will then be sufficient, and the
purchase of a fire engine would bo
doubling expenses for the same end "
;! The wagon will serve merely as
a pleasure car for the chief
"This chemical car is called by the
factor a 'chief's regulation car.' In
manv cities they do not have the
diemical tanks on the car. 11 sup
plying the car with the chemical
tanks the city is making the auto
servo a double purpose. It is neccs
sar that I have the car at hand, so
as to reach an blaze at the earliest
possible moment. If I use the tar in
making a trip away from the station
it is mere! to prevent an delay in
reaching a blaze."
What Other College Towns Have.
4 The cit docs not need any more
apparatus now.
"Lawrence, Kan, has two distinct
fire stations, and Champaign, 111.,
has three stations. Columbia, which,
like these cities, is the home of a state
university, lias only one station. It
would be the best thing to equip an
other station, with another crew and
fire truck as we have, but that would
be expensive. With the chemical car,
we are prepared to take care of two
fires at once, while we could answer
on one call now. If the big truck
should be put out of commission now,
we would be helpless in case of any
kind of blaze."
.1 The chemical motor car is not
an efficient machine.
"The car that is on exhibition here
is equipped with two 3.1-gallon tanks
On! one is attached to the hose at a
time While the second tank is be
ing emptied, the first one can be re
filled; hence a continuous stream can
lie kept in iila. The outfit is equip
ped with 130 feet of hose, which is
sufficient to reach from the road into
a dwelling. A longer strip of hose
can be added if necessary."
Most Tiros on Are Small.
fi The motor car would be an un-
nccossar.v additional expense.
"The machine on exhibition can be
purchased for .'2.000. A fire engine
would tost at least $9,000. The
chemical car will also save the city
much in overhead expense, as it will
cost much less to operate the chemi
cal car than the big truck. More
than so per cent of the fires in Co
lumbia require only the use of chemi
cals The chemical auto would really
le the main factor, and the big truck
would be used only in case the blaze
"as too big for the chemical car.

With this car we could be of great as
sistance to farmers near Columbia,
while we cannot help them at all now.
Columbia should do all it can to cut
down the loss b fire both within and
without the city limits.
"If the city will buy the car, the
University will let the city use its pul
motor for general service day and
night. The pul motor cannot be work
ed practically with the present truck.
"I recommended the chemical car
to the council morel as a means of
increasing the efficiency of the fire
department at the lowest possible
cost," said Chief Kurtz. "It is in no
wa a personal matter to me, and an
person who looks at the matter from
that side is wrong."

Kansas city and practically every
town in this part of the country have
had the same excess of water and
main towns have been badly damaged

and Tennessee have also suffered
heavily from the storm.
I.ocallv the damage has not been so
great. The wind has not attained a

in Columbia, though it has been very
consistent, averaging 2.1 miles an hour
for six or seven hours at a stretch
