WAR MINISTER
DIES ON WAY
TO PETROGRAD
Lifeboats Put Out From
Doomed Vessel But Swamp
in Heavy Sea; Observers
See Tragedy From Shore
LONDON, June 6.—England sustained another
numbing shock today, when the admiralty an
nounced that Lord Kitchener, minister of war,
with his entire staff, perished when the cruiser
Hampshire was sunk off the south coast of Scotland last
Lord KitcJie-tie-f.
was running.
The admiralty stated there is little hope that any of
the members of Kitchener's party survived. It is ac
cepted as a fact that Kitchener himself was drowned.
The Hampshire was a British cruiser of the Argyll
type. Her complement was 655 officers and men. She was
450 feet long, displaced 10,850 tons. Her armament was four
7-inch guns, --ix f»-inch guns and two torpedo tubes.
The Hampshire was in command of Captain Herbert J.
Savil. The report of the loss of the ship was telegraphed
to the admiralty by Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, commanding
the British Home fleet.
Whole Shoreline Searched for
Survivors, But Without Success
The first announcement from London did not indicate
the circumstances under which the Hampshire was sunk.
The admiralty announcement stated merely that the
Hampshire was sunk "by mine or torpedo."
The news of England's greatest personal loss since the
war, which has stunned London, already hardened to shocks,
was issued in the following formal bulletin:
"The admiralty reports with deep regret that the ship
Hampshire, with Lord Kitchener and his staff on board, was
sunk last night about 8 o'clock off the Orkney islands by a
mine or a torpedo. Four bAats were seen by observer* oa
the shore to leave the ship. Heavy seas were running, but
patrol vessels and destroyers at once proceeded to the scene.
The whole shore has been searched from seaward but it is
greatly feared there is little hope for any survivors."
Kitchener Said to Have Been
Starting for Russia for Conference
A later announcement from the admiralty said that the
searching parties, >cnt out in boats along the coast, had found
only bodies of the drowned and one capsized boat.
There was still the faint hope that possibly some might
have reached shore and proceeded inland in search of aid.
On account of the high sea. however, this was not con
sidered likely and the admiralty did not encourage the hope of
any survivors being found.
It was stated that the Hampshire was on her way to
Russia where Kitchener was to hold conferences with of
ficials at Petrograd.
According to official announcement, the following were
included in Karl Kitchener's party:
Kicut Col. Fitzgerald, Brig Gen. F.llershaw, Sir H. Fred
erick Donaldson and IK J. O'Bcirne, at one time counsellor
to the British embassy at Petrograd.
Public Consternation Follows
Announcement in London
Public consternation and amazement today followed th%
announcement of Kord Kitchener's death.
Crowds gathered in Whitehall, about the pos*efi'ice, seels,
