BULGARS HOLD AL!
BUT OUT FORT I
Will Now Be Ab'e to Block Landing
of Troops By Allies
MUCH INDIGNATION IN GREECE
Capture of Seaport Has Aroused
Nation More Than Any Other Act
of the War.
Paris, Auk. 27. The Bulgars have
occupied all but one of the Greek forts
about Kavala, the important Greek
port on the Algean Sea, the War Of
fice announced officially tonight. The
town of Kavala has not been entered.
On Friday two British monitors and
a cruiser steamed into the Gulf of Ka
vala and bombarded the forts, on
which the red, white and green tlag of
Bulgaria had replaced the blue and
white of Greece.
The occupation of the Kava'a forts
secures for the Bulgars a valuable
port on the AEgean, but most of all
presents an obstacle to any possible
landing of allied troops there and vir
tually puts Into the minds of Bulgaria
the principal city of northeastern
Greece, which Bulgaria covets.
News of the taking of the. Kavala
forts by the Bulgars has caused more
indignation among the Greeks than
any act of aggression their enemies of
the north have committed, unlesj it
be the wiping out of the Greek garri
son at Seres. The Greeks can hardly
be persuaded by King Constantino or
anybody else that Bulgaria, once se
curely in uossession of Kavala, will
ever return it to Greece.
The iuvaslon of Albania from the
east by another Bulgar column Is an
nounced also in the official statement
issued from Sofia yesterday and tela
graphed here. This column marched
south from Ochrida Lake, on the bor
der between Serbia and Albania, and
captured the town of Malik, v. men is
on the River Devoi. ten miles within
the border between Greece ind A)
ban la.
Malik is seventy miles northeast of
the Albanian port of Aviona, which is
occupied by the Italians. Fighting
there has been reported recently, and
a few days ago the Italians occupied
commanding positions on the Adriatic
shore. Evidently warfare between
Italians and Bulgars Is in sight. Most
H the troops occupying northern Al
banu are believed to bo Austrlans.
Plenty of hot fighting between Bui
gars and Serbs and some patrol fight
ing and artillery, bombardment be
tween the British a.ud the French and
their Bulgar foes are reported in the
various official stateruenu. which con
filet somewhat. Most of the fighting
Is occurring upon the flanks, where
the Bulgars are pushing forward into
Greek territory occupied by small de
tachments of the Allies. The main
attack at tho center has not do
veloped.

President Has New Prooosal Ntt
Likely to Be Accepted
BROTHERHOOD MEN GO HOME
If Eight-Hour Day is Not Granted
Within Ten Days 400,000 Men Are
Going Out.
Washington, Aug. 2!). President
Wilson has a new proposal to submit
to the two factions involved in Hie
threatened railroad strike. While
maintaining the principal of the 8-hour
day he is ready to submit the adjust
ment of condition made necessary by
t he change to a commission of five
who shall work out the details and
take a year to do It, if necessary. It
is not expected that the railroad pres
idents will agree to the new proposal.
Washington, Aug 28. Tentative
plans for a joint session of the senate
and house to Hear President Wilson
ask for legislation to prevent the
threatened nation wide railroad strike
were discussed by the president wit?,
Senator Kern, the democratic leader,
last night, when it seemed virtually
certain that a break between the rail
roads and their employes must follow
final conferences at the White House
today.
Possibilities of legislation were talk
ed over by the president with Senator
Newlands. Chairman of the Interstate
commerce commission, ami becniaiy
Lane during the day, and last night he
made a quiet trip to the senate office
building to find Senator Kern attend
ing a meeting of the finance commit
tee. Since Saturday night the belief that
negotiations between the railroad ex
ecutives and representatives of the
men would end without an Agreement
has been growing. 'I lie leeling was
strengthened yesterday, when tin
members of the brotherhood commit
tee of 04i, tired of their tong wait, de
parted for home after delegating their
powers to effect a settlement or call a
strike to a committee of M. instructed
under no circumstances to agree to ur
bitration of the demand for an eight
hour day at the present rate of pay
for 10 hours.
Whether the plans considered by
President Wilson and his advisers at
the capitel will be carried out di
pends upon today's developments, but
it Is understood that if all efforts fail
to bring tlie employers and their men
together the president will go before
congress and ask t hut it deal with
the situation, even if that necessitates
Indefinitely prolonging the present
session.
I'nless the railroad heads recede
from their demand for arbitration of
the eight-hour day proposal, one bro
therhood heud snld last night, a strike
nlfecting about lini.i men would be
called within the next B days.
Representatives of both the railways
and the brotherhood will confer with
tho president today. The executives
of the lines will present the plan
to which they agreed to finally Sat
urday. Its outstanding feature Is i
demand for at bitration of wages under
the eight-hour day or any day. When
they have departed the brotherhood
heads, acting under Instructions ri
eeived from the committee of 040 yea
terday, will go to the While House
anil apprise President Wilson that they
cannot accept arbitration and that In
general they stand on his proposal
made a week ago. to concede the eight
hour principle nnd arbitrate the other
Issue'.
What will follow no one attempts to
forecast accurately. There was a re
port last night, however, that the prcs
ident might nsk the men to postpom
action for a period in order that hi
illicit seek legislation which would
force nnd provide for a settlement
without tying up the country's trans
imitation systems.

ITALY IS III Will
WITH GERMANY
AFTERJODAY
Formal Declaration of Hostilities
Made at Rome
NOTICE THROUGH SWIIZERW-D
Unusual Procedure Necessary as
Nations Severed Diplomatic Re
lations Last Year.
Borne, Aug. 28. Italy has declared
war on (lerniuny. The following of
ficial nanouiicemcnt was made here
yesterday "The Italian government
has declared through the Swiss gov
ernment that it considers itself, from
August 28, at war with Germany!"
Italy and dernuiny have been drift
ing steadily toward war. In fact,
Italy's formal declaration amounts to
little more than official recognition of
a state of affairs which already ex
isted. The declaration became inevit
able when Italy recently sent troops
to Salonica to co-operate In the cam
paign ol the entente allies on the
Macedonian front, inasmuch as Ger
many is directing the opposing forces
ami lias troops on this buttle line.
Ualv's position In regard to Ger
many had been anomalous after Italy
Withdrew from the triple alliance on
May 22 of last year and declared war
on Austria. Aitnougn oy this act she
arrayed herself on the side of the en
tente lowers and against her former
allies. Germany and Austria, she re
mained officially at peace with Ger
many. Before Italy took this steji
Germany exerted every effort to in
duce her to remain neutral, sending
to Borne as embassador Prince Von
Ituelow former chancellor and one of
the ablest statesmen of Germany.
The prince succeeded for some time
in averting war between Austria and
Italy, and when ho saw a rupture was
Inevitable took steps toward preserva
tion of an official peace between Ger
many and Italy. On behalf of his gov
ernment be negotiated with Italy a
special agreement under which in case
of war between Austria and Italy Ger
many and Italy pledged themselves to
respect tho properties and lives of
their respective subjects in each
t tier's domains. This meant for Ger
many a guarantee Of many millions of
dollars' worth of properties in Italy
and lor Italy the safety of 80.000
Italian subjects who were stiii living
in Germany.
Although officially at peace until
yesterday. Italy and Germany severed
iliplomatic relations last year. On the
day following Italy's declaration of
war against Austria Prince von Hue-
low and his staff departed from Home,
and two days later the Italian cm-
Imssor at Berlin, Bicardo Bollati,
was withdrawn. It was on account
of this fact that Italy adopted the un
usual procedure of asking Switzerland
to inform Germany Of .her declaration

THE BATTLE OF "TIN FORKS"
Bennington Rookie Writes of the Ma
neouvres at Plattsburg.
Plattsburg, Aug. 24. Companies L
and M of the lull fought thut which
will go down In history as the buttle
"Tin Forks" and a rearguard en
gagement on the morning and after
noon respectively of August 21st. The
thermometer was ItS degrees in the
hade, We of L were inarched through
the city ol Plattsburg and thence due
west to a point about 4 1-2 miles from
camp. u. had ammunition (bluiiKs of
ourse) and our full loaded packs,
sonic twenty pounds, 1 suppose.
(When I come home, 1 am going to
make up twenty pounds of bricks. Hat
irons, etc., with two shoulder straps,
nul get a nine pound iron rod and let
anyone who so desires try it out
cross country).
Quitting the highway, we were de
ployed behind a rail fence with scrub
stuff growing along it and a wood be
hind, permitting a good "get-away"
if necessary. The captain, addressing
us, said that we were a light force
sent forward ny the .comuuiuikr ilk
hiof to hold the position, and tho
nemy (company Ml would try to get
us out. Their main approach would be
down the field which sloped up n
gentle incline before us. To give
warning of any attempt to turn us or
the flanks, ho purposed sending small
latrols out to the right up the road
we had come, and up along the stone
fence to tho left. This ho did.
It fell to me to go with my corporal
and three others to sneak up a couple
of hundred yards or so buck of the
fence at our left. Ill doing scout
work, the leader deploys his men, so
we wi re scattered back of the fence
it easy Speaking distance.
Shortly . moving points appeared on
the sky line of the field. They were
the scouts of the enemy who presently
ippeared in lorce, prone on tho crest,
in the grass. The plan of attack was
in advance by platoons of 12 or 10
men BSCn, tine platoon rises, runs
forward some yards, again falls prone,
ind resumes tiring out of the gruss
This Is repeated by the several other
platoons in succession.
The enemy (Company M) had not
taken the precaution to investigate
what might be behind the stone fenci
and. though it was hardly our business
the chance was too good. We four
sneaked a little farther up behind th
fence, and when the first platoon
moved down the field in the face of the
file which came from Co. L behind tin
fence before the grove, thev wen
struck on the flank from the several
rifles behind the stone wall.
Well, it was a glorious victory. We
assembled for lunch. As the battle
was discussed over buenn and potatoes
which each man tried in the alumi
nuni frying pan which I'ncle Sam puts
in the pack. It was decided that th
real execution ol the dav .wis done
with the "tin forks." Therefore tin

I am sorry not to be able to stop the
story here, but the truthful historian
must record that on the way home M
lompnu.v made a line rearguard action
and (aught several platoons of L com
