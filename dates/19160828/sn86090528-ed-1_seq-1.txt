A stalk which, if it Were an average
would yield a bale of cotton to the
acre, was brought in to the Farm Bu

COLLECTING
IS BRISK
Records of Four Years Broken in Payment
of Paving Taxes Due to Settlement
of Dispute
"This has been tho best week in the
collection of paving and grading taxes
that we have had in three or four
years," said City Clerk E. G. Reynolds
to an eExpress reporter today. "In or
der to avoid further heavy penalties
the people are coming in rapidly to
settle for this and for past years. This
rush is probably due to the fact that
the question of whether they nuist ulti
mately pay in full has ueen practically
settled and the interested parties real
ize that it Is poor business to tack an
other eighteen per cent onto all that
Is now duo by waiting until after the
first of the month to pay up."
The collections during the past week
in the city clerk's office have totalled
$o500, of which $2100 was paid in on
Friday and Saturday.
There are now four more days in
which to pay including the first of the
month, after which the usual 18 per
cent will be attached.
The city clerk will continue to keep
his office1 open during the noon hour
during the four days of grace which
still remain, including the first of Sep
tember, and will not close until 6 p.'m.

That Sammy Dwyer has done his
work well as motorcycle cop Is evi
denced by the fact that when his hon
or. Mayor connian, openea ponce
court this morning there was not a sin
gle case of speeding or cutting corners
on the docket. While the regulation
$5 dose may have been regarded
lightly in the beginning it has appar
ently ceased to be a novelty and auto
ists are paying stricter attention to
their speedometers and to the centers
of intersecting streets when turning
corners. .
Three negro women, Clara Moore,
Baby Lilly and Rose Wilson, were
fined $3 each today for disturbing the
peace.
B. II. Booker. S. J. Golden and J. S.

sive language to a woman, forfeited a
$25 cash bond when his case was call
ed at 9 o'clock.

Ing drunk and W. M. Bates $5 for the
same offense.
After court had convened Sammy
Dwyer showed up with the first charge
he had entered since Saturday morn
ing, that against R. D. Smith for re
fusing to stop and for speeding. Smith
put up a $5 bond and his case was con
tinued. SHIPMENT OF HOGS.

ufacturer from Ramseur, N. C, and
Arthur Lee, representing the Ameri
can Warehouse Co., at Wichita, Kan
sas, both of whom arrived In Chicka

AUTO TAX
RETURNED
TO COUNTY
County Treasurer II. N. Mullican to
day received from the state depart
ment of highways a check for $108(5.30,

state department $714.70 came from
the owners of cars outside of Chick

the city. One fourth of the amount
paid by Chickasha autoists will be
turned over to the city treasurer and
the remainder, together with tho other
sum received from the state, becomes
a part of the cpunty road fund.
Since the collection of the auto tax
was begun the first of the year Grady

last month. A penalty of not less than
$30 is provided for failure to pay the
tax.

take him to Lindsay. But he did not
get there. On Saturday night he was
found broke and drunk and was again
lodged in jail. He drew on his bank
this morning but Desk Sergeant Loon
ey took no chances and after paying
his $6 fine kept him in jail until the
departure of his train today for Lind
say, when he escorted him to the sta
tion and placed him aboard.

Outfit Brought in by John Abernathy After
Several Thousand Acres are

PAID FOR LEASES
Preparations Completed lo Drill Twenty
Inch Hole to Depth of 6,000
Feet for Oil
After gumshoeing it for several
weeks during which timo he and I. W.
Williams, former deputy United States
marshal at Purceli, had obtained leas
es on several thousand acres of most
promising oil lands, John Abernathy,
an experienced oil man, has unloaded
at Lindsay today a largo oil drilling
outfit with which he will begin imme
diate operations twelve miles south
west of that town. Mr. Williams In
the past few weeks has paid out over
$6,00 for oil leases, giving terms more
liberal than had been expected by the
owners of the property.
"This territory looks most promis
ing." said Mr. Willi:ims today. "Fa
vorable reports havo been received
from several prominent geologists
who have made examinations and
their reports justify the big tests
which Mr. Aberuutl y is prepared to
make.
LOCAL CROP
CONDITIONS
"I was in the east part of the county
In the vicinity of Naples, Blanchard,
and Middleburg," said W. D. Har-
graves, who returned yesterday,
"where, on Walnut and Bitter creeks
the farmers will make at least three
fourths of a crop of corn. Cotton In
that section Is cut at least half in two.
This is a large cattle growing area
and the pastures are almost gone. The
biggest job which the farmer now has
Is to keep water for his cattle. This
is the section in which the recent hail
storm fell. The June corn was badly
damaged and will yield no crop at all.
The only part of it that can be saved
Is the fodder.
"Of the broom corn ana cotton
which was planted in this hail district,
the broom corn will make three-quarters
of a crop and will be of good qual
ity. Cattle feeders are making an ef
fort to engage the corn for feeding pur
poses this winter. It is an exceptional
ly fine year for Soudan grass and
those who were fortunate enough to
sow this year aro getting a full crop.
It is a pity that more farmers did not
start it. j

section will raise enough hogs to make

Buenos Aires, August 1. (By mail.)
South America's republics today are
sitting over just another powder mag
azine as the one which exploded two
years ago in Europe. In many ways
the situation recalls the situation ex
isting in Europe Just a few years be
fore the outbreak of the present strug

Venezuela and Peru and Colombia and
Ecuador brought South America ti
sharp attention. They might easily

GUARDIANS
EXECUTORS
ARE BUSY
Reports Must Now Be Approved by County
Judge Belore Action Will Be Taken
on Indian Claims
If anyone labors under tho delusion
that a county judge does not earti his
salary he should have been present in
court today when Judge Davenport
made a dive into 150 reports of guard
ians, administrators and executives,
tho approval of whose annual state
ments is required in order that any of
these wards or estates which have In
dian claims may be paid. Previous to
a recent ruling of the probate attorney
the annual report was obliged to be
filed only but the approval of these
accounts is now necessary before any
claim will be considered.
The reports were received from sev
enty-five different people charged
with estates and wards who were call
ed rm today. And the worst is yet to
come.
Owing to tire illness of bis . wife
Judge W. H. Woods of Purceli, pro
bate attorney, did not appear ou hH
usual round in Chickasha today.
The sale and approval of sale by
wards under the charge of John O.
Toole of McAIester brought that gen
tleman here today at a hearing before

REFUSED
By United Press.
Austin, Tex., Aug. 2S. The state
railroad commission today cancelled
every advance in rates made as a re
sult of the hearings a year ago on the
petition of the roads for more revenue.
The order will be effective September
1, and will reinstate rates In effect be
fore the new tariffs wero made.
The order was the result of the
agreement of the railroads last week to
ignore several Texas-made rates be
tween points affected by the Interstate
Commerce decision in the Shreveport
case.
A. J. Mauldin of Purceli Is here on
legal business.
POWDER MAGAZINE
groaning under the weight of these
preparations and the same undercur
rent of international ill-feeling.
If and when war comes the two prin
cipal belligerents probably will be Ar
gentina and Chile.
Not a country in South America
lacks a boundary dispute with some
other country. Each is a little Alsace
Lorraine. Chile and Argentina had a nasty dis
pute of the kind in lfci'tS. It reached
the point of mutual mobilization. Ens
land interfered and arbitrated. Ar
gentina got a large area of land hi
Southern Patagonia which Chile
claimed should have gone to the lat
tfr. This has rankled ever since.

of all the surrounding thousands of
acres, but since Uncle Sam reserved
the territory for a people's playground
it is officially known as tho Rocky

it" amidst surroundings as luxurious
as anything obtainable In tho country's
finest hostelries. They feel right at
home among the prices, too, the rates
being $4 a day and skywards.
Newspapermen with the candidate,
why try to trail him on automobila
trips in the Estes Park region, will
learn something about the cost of high
living that no New York tux! possibly
could teach them.
Wild animal life, glaciers, glacial
lakes, everlasting snow, luxurious ho
tels, beautiful automobile routes,
mountain climbing, Colorado sunshine,
meadows of wild flowers and plnev
woods are only a few of the delights
of this region.

Bucharest dispatches which were heav

meet today. Continued preparations
for war are being reported. Italy's
declaration of war against Germany
yesterday may Influence the Rouman
ian's action. It Is generally under
stood that Roumania had planned to
enter with Italy In May, 1913, but th
severe defeat of the Russians at that
time made it seem certain that such
a declaration would be followed by the
invasion of Roumania, by the Austro
Germans. Roumania' entrance makes fifteen
nations engaged in the war. It places
a thoroughly drilled and equipped ar

of annexing th? two Austrian provinc
