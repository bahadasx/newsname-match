Situation is the Most Perilous Since the Opening
of Negotiations Two Weeks Ago Leaders in
Congress Confer With President With View
to Meeting Great Emergency Should Strike
Result Decision Expected in 24 Hours.
Washington, Aug. 28 President Wilson's negotiations for
averting the threatened nation
with a break or a settleihent apparently not far off.
President Wilson's plan for breaking the deadlock be
tween the railroads and their employes as discussed today
was as follows:
An eight-hour law for railroads to become effective at a
date far enough in the future to give the railroads opportun
I ity to prepare for it. ,
A law patterned after the Canadian act which creates a
commission of investigation and prevents lockouts or strikes
while an industrial dispute is being investigated.
With the railway executives standing firm against conced
ing the eight-hour day and the brotherhood leaders still stand
ing out against arbitrating it, the hope of preventing a tie-up of
ithe country's transportation systems seemed to lie with Con
gress. '
Just exactly what can be done, none of the Congressional
leaders themselves seem to know. Conferences among them and
with President Wilson which began last night were continued
(today and the President postponed his engagement with the
railway executives from 10 o'clock this. morning until 2:30
o'clock this afternoon, to give him more time for conferences
with leaders in Congress.
The situation was viewed on all sides as the most perilous
since the negotiations began two weeks ago. The hope of the
iPresident and administration leaders was ia the possibility of
getting the brotherhood men to give more time to continue the
negotiations.
Resigned to remaining in Washing-
rton to undertake' any legislation in
ithe railroad crisis, members of Con
gress today were studying the prob
Jem and waiting word from President
Wilson.
No one except Senators who have
tfeeen in conference with the President
has any definite idea of what he may
ask Congress to do. Many members
of both houses, however, have ideas
' ' of their own.
Some Progressive Republican Sena
tors declared that in their opinion, in
the event of a strike, the President
would ask Congress to direct federal
receiverships to operate the railroads
during the conflict. Probability of
legislation for government ownership
was too remote to be considered in
this crisis, they declared.
House leaders have no program.
Senator Kern, the majority leader,
said all hope of adjournment next
Friday had been abandoned.
The four brotherhood heads issued
a statement replyingo President Rea,
of the Pennsylvania, who last njght
made an announcement that rather
than . give up arbitration the roads
preferred to face a strike. The state
ment charged the Pennsylvania with
inconsistency in that two years ago
it fought the efforts of its shopmen
to organize and arbitrate. It also de
clared that as the controlling interest
in five smaller roads it has refused
them representation on the managers'
.AnfeppnM rnmmittefi and that if ar-
titration were agreed upon it would
not apply to these roads.
In the hands of a committee of 24,t
whom the entire committee of 640, be
fore leaving for their homes yester
day, instructed to listen to no pro
'posal involving arbitration of the
eight-hour base toay. Strike orders
were being circulated, to await tele
graphic release.
The counter-proposal for arbitration
was to be made to the President to
day by the railway executives as their
first deflrite answer to his suggestion
of a week ago for concession of the
eight-hour day with ten hours pay
and arbitration of other issues. As
eoon as the employes' committee has
rejected the executives' counter-proposal
the President is exoected' to set
,Jn motion the congressional wheels
through the leaders in both houss.
It was reported President Wilson
was considering asking both sides to
postpone action for a certain period.
-leanwhile.i it might be possible to
enact legislation similar to the Can
adian law, providing for investigation
of labor disputes by a commission and
forbidding strikes or lockouts pending
Inquiry. This course -vas being dis
cussed seriouslv with the possibility
that it would be put into immediate
effect, thus preventing a strike with
f auate public Investigation.

DOCTOR'S CRIES

Neighbor Forces Entrance
and Finds Dr. E. H. Wood
Critically 111.
MADE SELF RECLUSE
AFTER WIFE'S DEATH
Prominent Physicians Con
' ferring in Effort to Save
Life of Friend.
Dr. Eugene H. Wood', a widely
known physician of this city, often
referred to as the dea.n of the Bridge
port medical profession, is said to be
in a critical condltiomat his home, 541
Fairfield avenue, following a sudden
and protracted illness during the
night of Thursday, Aug. 17, when he
was alone in the house and unable to
summon assistance by his cries.
Rumors circulated today that the
aged physician had been beaten by
thugs who had first chloroformed him
and then attempted' robbery are set at
rest today by the many reputable phy
sicians attending him.
Dr. Wood, who has lived the life al
most as a recluse since the death of
his wife last spring, was alone in the
home when he was stricken with in
ternal pain resulting from an old and
unusual operation upon the gall duct.
He was afflicted with extreme weak
ness and nausea.
Attempts upon his part to summon
aid during the night were fruitless
and during a part of the morning his
continued efforts were so indistinct
as to be little heeded from the street.
Mrs. George H. Carter, living in' the
adjoining house, at 554 Fairfield ave
nue, heard the faint moans and cries.
At first she paid mile attention to
them, but when he crawled downstairs
and managed to push open a window,
she heard his moans distinctly. She
summoned assistance and forced an
entrance to the house.
Dr. Wood was found in a
very weakened state. He was
able to say that he had been very
sick and unable to get assistance. He
asked that a phys'cian be called Im
mediately. Dr. Chaes C. Godfrey,
hi associate, being absent from the
city. Dr. Samuel M. Garlick and Dr.
George Garlick responded to the tele
phone reauest of Mrs. Carter. Restor
atives were prescribed and as the case
appeared most serious Drs- Robert
Lynch.Edwards M. Smith and Williara
C. Watson were summoned in con
ference. . Dr. Wood was removed immediately
to the LeVey hospital in Norman
street. He was brought home last
night after relations 'up-state had
been notified of his condition and were
prepared to care for him.
Though the reported purchase of a
large quantity of chloroform by a
young man who was known to have
visited the Wood home on Thursday
morning gave rise to a rumor that
an attempt had been made to chlor
oform the physician, it is now estab
lished by physicians attending the
case that this anaesthetic is among
others being used to deaden the ex
treme pain the patient is suffering. It
is not unlikely that the patient used
this remedy himself in small doses.

ing pot and Piclani had just ladled
the metal. He had backed, away
from the pot and Sporani was stand
ing with another ladle in his place.
Of a sudden, something sputtered and
an explosive sound was followed with
the shouts of the three workmen.
Other employes of the foundry hurried
to their assistance and found that the
metal had spattered about them.
First aid was rendered the three
men while a call was sent in for in
ambulance. Legg was severely burn

metal narrowly escaped going in his
eyes. Ficlani suffered second degree

RUMANIAN WAR
DECREE CAUSES
DROP IN WHEAT
Chicago, Aug. 28 Rumania's de
claration of war smashed the wheat
market. Opening prices showed a
fall in some "cases amounting to 5
cents a bushel. September delivery,
which closed Saturday at $1.51,
started today at $1.46 to $1.48.
Other options also brqke wildly.
General rushes o sell took place
which were increased by the increas
ed chances of a general railway strike
in the United States.
Before the decline could be check
ed, an extreme drop of 8 cents a
bushel had been recorded.
Notwithstanding that the tremend
ous pressure to unload holdings car
ried away for a while all other con
siderations, the extraordinary break
proved too tempting for buyers to re
sist and the market showed the con
sequence in rallies of three cents to
3 M cents from the lowest level.
Pear traders generally took the view
that the action of Rumania was likely
to prove a big factor in forcing a more
ppeedy end of hostilities or would at
least tend to hurry the opening of the
Dardanelles and so release huge Rus
sian shipments of wheat.

Rumanians' Decree
Received at Vienna
Amsterdam, Aug. 28 The note de
claring that Rumania from 9 o'clock
Sunday evening considered herself in
a state of war with Austria-Hungary,
was presented to the Austro-Hun-garian
foreign minister last night by
the Rumanian minister at Vienna.
A Bucharest despatch'received yes-.
terday stated that King Ferdinand, of;
Rumania, had convened a conference ;
of representatives of all the political
parties with the idea of ascertaining
the views of all sections of publio "
opinion. . "
The Wolff Bureau, which makes the
announcement that Rumania has cast
her fortunes with the entente allies,
is a semi-official German news agency
which frequently is used as an avenue
for making public official announce
ments. Rumania is the fourteenth nation ,
to join In the war. Her intervention i
either on the side of the entente al- j
lies or the central powers has been ,
awaited 'with concern by both since:
the beginning of the great conl'ict. i
This is due not entirely to Rumania's ,
military strength but also to the Mral ;
tegic advantages of her geographical;
position and the fact that her entry j
into the struge.'c opens to the Russltn,
army ti gateway through RumanU to
attock the Unitarians from the Tenth.,
while the allied army, having iia base ;
at Saloniki attacks them and lln.-ir
Gorman allies fixm the south.
Rumania, with a population of
6,800,000 and an army estimated at ,
580,000, often has been described as
one of the most thoroughly equipped
and disciplined in Burope. Lately,
however, it has been stated that Ru
manian officers are ill-trained and
undisciplined, that Rumania has no
heavy artillery and that its flying ser
vice is inferior: Some advocates of
Rumfjiia's participation in the war
haCKsserted that she could mobilize
a'many as 1,000,000 men. The mob
ilization -of her army has been in pro
gress for months and a few days ago
it was reported to be complete.
The motive which prompts Ru
mania to enter the war is the satisfac
tion of her "national aspirations"
described by Take Jonescu, the Ru
manian liberal leader, as the "policy
of national insistence." Concisely, this
means national expansion. In the
southern half of Bukowina, the Aus
trian crown land, the Rumanians are
the dominant race. It is said 4,000,
000 Rumanians live in Transylvania.
Rumania ha3 been credited with &
long-cherished ambition to annex
these provinces and at the same time
"liberate" the Rumanians now under
Austrian domination.
Rumania also covets Besserabia,
the extreme southwestern province of
Russia, on the Black Sea, which was
taken from her by the Berlin treaty
of 1878. Reports have stated that
Russia also has consented to -restore
Bessarabia as a war prize, with its
population of 2,000,000, mostly Ru
manians, and an area of 20,000 square ,
miles.
Rumania has a border line as long
as the whole Russian western war
front on which to choose her point
of military attack. In what dlrcc
