WILSON FAVORED
' BY SEAMEN'S HEAD
i _
Andrew Furuseth Declares Re
Election Is Necessary to Best
Interests of Wage Earners.
! GIVES REASONS FOR OPINION
Would Regard Defeat as Calam
ity to Industrial and Commer
cial Welfare of America.
nv DA NTI2 BA11 TON,
j Vice-chairman ?r the Federal Com
| mlttee on I ndiiit rlnl Relation*.
The American seaman is going back
; to the sea. lie is going hack at wages
| .>0 per cent higher thnn they were up
;to a year ago. And he is going hack
a free man."
Those are thc chief reasons given by
Andrew Furuseth. president of the In
? ternational .Seamen's Union or Arnnrl
t ca, and for twenty years a fighter for
the seamen's bill, which is now a law,
why he is an ardent supporter of
President Wilson and is Riving ail the
time and energy he can to th? Presl- |
dent's re-election.
"The continuance of the Wilson ad
ministration is necessary to the best
interests of all wage earners or
America." said Mr. Furuseth In an
; interview given to me in Washington.
It is essential to the interests of
American seamen and the upbuilding I
of the American merchant marine I '
I wo?ld regard Mr. Wilson's defeat in
this election, and particularly bv those
who are now opposing him. as* a ca
| 'amity to the industrial and commer- |
rial welfare of America. As the child
? M b,iH ?f thc has freed
the little children from servitude so
the seamen's law. aiso approved and,
.Pushed through by the President, has!
? freed the Americans who go down to I
| the sea In ships." j
Andrew Furuseth is himself an able
seaman who looks like an old Viking.
His face is weather-worn from storms
at sea and from twenty years of legis
lative hardships in Washington. The
pent-up gales within him fairlv blew
the words from him as he said'to the
interviewer:
korkikx vessels PAV same
WAGES AS AMERICAX
i "???*? H>a? one year of thc operation
j of ,he seaman's act has raised the
I wages of American seamen to a stand
ard of from *45 to $55 a. month. At all
prlncpal ports on the Atlantic and
Pacific the foreign vessels are paving
the same wages as the American vea
| sels. ...
"Right along %vith that, American
owned ships are going back on the
high seas with American cargoes, the
I ships manned by American sailor*
This month thc first of the vessels of
, the reorganized Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company sails for the Orient To
oppose this bill, the falsehood ' waa
told anri believed by many persons, that
the ships of that companv had been
driven from the Pacific by this sea-j
men s act. The truth was that the
Pacific Mail Steamship Companv was
forbidden to us* the Panama Canal be- |
cause it was owned by the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company and for that '
reason it had to ?juit business and be
reorganised."
"Specifically." l asked Mr. Furuseth,
"what has the seamen's act done for!
j American seamen and American ship
ping. and how has it done it?"
"Specifically, it has made ships safe
for passengers and -row by its pro
vision that 7.*. per cent of all the crew
shall be able t?. understand the lan
; sruaKe 0f tship's officers, for orders
: in emergencies, such as storms, col
lisions and fires, as well as for or
J ders in ordinary times.
"Specifically. It has brought greater
, safety through provisions for lifeboats
, and better ship construction.

him in any port of call with the right

, has raised wages by improving the
standard of seamen, it has equalized
i the wages on American and foreign ves
: sels, because in order to keep their own
seamen in American ports foreign
j shipowners have had to give their

WASHINGTON, August 27.?In a lot

j given out for publication here. Secre- j
tary of the Navy Joscphus Daniels re
j view at great length the achievements
! of the Wilson administration in build- 1
I ing up the American navy.
Only once in our history. Mr. Daniels
j wrote, was our navy first In the world, j
, That was In the Pierce administration,
I when eighteen steani vessels were
added to our fleet, while all the British
; ships were still wooden sailing vessels
j and side-wheel star steamers.
Replying to Mr. Williams's question
; regarding when the United States navy
! wan second and when it became third
among the nations. Mr. Daniels quoted
the following statement by tho gen
eral hoard:
"fa) Considering displacement of
ships built, the United States advanced
from third to second place in 1907, and
dropped to third place in 1911,
'(b) Considering displacement of
ships built and building, the United
?States advanced from third to second
Place In 1909. held this place for a
short time only, and dropped to third
place again in the same year, 1909.
"(c) Considering active personnel,
tho United States advanced from third
to second place in 1508. dropped to
| third place In 1911, and to fourth place
j In 1913. The United States advanced
j again to third place in the first part
| ?f 1914, and later that year dropped to
sixth place, owing to the expansion of
, the naval personnel of belligerent na
tions."

"The United States lost second place
because Germany built ships rapidly
while the United States contented It
self with a small program of naval
construction. In 1903 the general
board urged tho adoption of a pro
gram providing for the construction
of two battleships a year. If that plan
had been carried out. by 1919 we would
have had forty-eight battleships, and
would have kept our place. Hut In
1905. the Secretary of the Navy (Mr.
Bonaparte) asked for only one battle
ship. and in his message to Congress

WASHINGTON, August 'JT.?Plana
for adjournment of Congress on next
Kriday arc not maturing as rapidly
nor as certainly as majority leaders,
co-operating with minority chieftains,
had contemplated. Tho crisis in the
railroad situation is the principal ob
stacle encountered at the eleventh
hour, and no one to-night would pre
dict what might happen or when the
long and arduous session would end.
Well-laid plans for adjournment at
the end of the week were in progress
yesterday when President Wilson's
visit to the Capitol to talk over plans i
for legislation which tho threatened ;
railroad strike might demand disturbed
all calculations.
niCGINK FINAL DHIVK
(iv uiovk\mo >i rc a si'ill-; [
The Sennte has begun tlie llnal drivo i
on the emergency revenue bill, and j
will continue consideration of amend
ments to-morrow with some of tlio
Democrats who are opposed to various
features of the bill. Senator Under
wood will make another protest
against the proposed increased tariffs
on dyestuffs. Senator Phelan, of Cali
fornia. wants amendments to the wine
tax, and Senator Overman, of North
Carolina, will lead a revolt against
the proposal to tax manufacturers of
all materials entering into munitions
of war 5 per cent on their net profits,
lie will propose to exempt all agricul- j
tural products from this tax. his amend
ment being designed to prevent, taxa
tion of cotton which enters into ex
plosives.
When amendments have been <lis- |
posed of tho Senates will lay aside the j
revenue bill long enough to pass the
general deficiency appropriation bill as
soon as it comes from the House on
Tuesday or Wednesday. With the
last of the appropriations out of the j
way and conference reports completed, i
administration leaders hope to pass the.
revenue, bill; to defeat motions that j
will be made to take up the corrupt '
practices and immigration bills, and I
then to adjourn. Senator Owen will j
struggle to the end for action on cor- |
rupt practices, and Senator Smith, of j
South Carolina, threatens to call up (
immigration again.
So far as known to-night, the only
legislation that may be pressed af- ,
feetlng tlie railroad situation is the
bill to enlarge the Interstate Com
merce Commission from seven to nine
members.
House leaders are going ahead with >
the completion of their program. With
a quorum of members In town, the
House will meet on Tuesday and act
on the deficiency appropriation bill.
It will follow this with action on the
amended shipping bill, which has been
held up because of the lack of a quo
rum. Then it will await the Senate
revenue bill amendments and what
ever the railroad crisis may have in
store. All thought. of passing a Joint
resolution for adjournment on a defi
nite day has been abandoned until the
clouded legislative atmosphere has
been cleared.

ROME, August 2S.?Italy to-day Is at
war with Germany.
The declaration of hostilities was
made by Italy. Following informa
tion that it had reached the Imperial
German government through Switzer
land. announcement of the govern
ment's action was made here late yes
terday.
The intolerable situation created by
the fact that Italy was at war with
Germany's a)ly. and the fact that Ger
many loaned all possible support to
that ally, Austria-Hungary, against
Italians and their Interests, led the
government to its decision. That de
cision was made public in the follow
ing announcement:
"The Italian government declares in
the name of the King that Italy con
Hitlers herself to be in a slate of
\s4ar with Germany as from August 28,
and begs the Swiss government to con
vey this information to the imperial
German government."
The complete cessation of all com
munlcatlon between Italy and Germany
brought about by the Austrian-Ital
ian war made It necessary for Italy to
convey through Switzerland her de
claration of war to Germany.
ntHMA.MA F.XPECTEH
TO FOI.I.OW EXA>11*1.13
It is believed here that Koumania,
with which nation Italy long has had
an entente, will follow the Italian gov
ernment In a declaration of war against
the central empires and their allies.
In soma quarters it is expcctcd that
this announcement by the Bukharest
government will come no later than
to-day or to-morrow.
Following a meeting of the Cabinet
yesterday, the official announcement of
?a state of war between Italy and Ger
many was made. A statement giving
the reasons for the action of the Ital
ian government also was given out
by Baron Sonnino, Minister of Foreign
Affairs. It is In the form of a com
munication to Switzerland, a neutral,
and was transmitted through tho Ital
ian minister at Heme. It says:
"The hostile acts of Germany to
ward Italy have become more frequent.
Suffice it to mention t li?y persistent
military aid rendered to Austria and
the constant participation of German
officers, soldiers and sailors in tho
war against Italy.
"Owing to German help, Austria
Hungary was enabled to concentrate
her maximum effort against Italy.
Germany gave up Italian prisoners who
had escaped front Austrian concentra
tion camps into German territory. The
imperial government Instructed tho
banks to consider Italians as enemies,
stopping payments and also stopping
pensions due Italian workmen, vio
lating 'he law openly and revealing
systematic hostility.
"This stato of things was intolerable,
aggravating and wholly to rtaly's
detriment, tho situation resulting from
the fact that Italy and Germany aro
a I Mod to different groups of states at
wa r.
"Kor these reasons the Italian gov
ernment declared, in the name of tho
King, that Italy considers herself in
a stato of war with Germany as from
August 2$, requesting the Swiss gov
ernment to inform Germany."

The announcement of war with GerJ
many had tho most cheering offcet
possible on the people. Great crowds
formed in the streets immediately tho
news became public, and processions
were started in many sections of Home.
Reports from the provincial cities tell
of eqtial rejoicing throughout the na

Diplomatic circles have information
that Koiimania will follow in Italy's
footsteps. The situation at Bukharest
has reached a crisis, it is declared. In
an effort to quiet the populace, a semi
official communication was issued there
yesterday. Tho transcript reaching
bore reads:
"The excitement and tityaslnes?
shown in various quarters in the last
few days made His Majisty desirous
of hearing privately the opinion, not
only of the government and the rep
resentatives In Parliament, but also of
