U.S. to Get Two "Unfavorable"
Replies to Notes This Week
On Boycott and Mail Issue
International .News Service:
WASHINGTON', Aug. 2S. Great
Britain's reply to the boycott pro
test, and the Anglo-French answer
to the interference with the mails
protests of this government, prole
ahly will reach Washington this
week. In both instances replies will
be unfavorable.
Diplomatic advices to that effect
reached here today. The French
foreign otfice. it is said, at last has
tigreed to uphold the British con
tention that all mail to and from
"enemy" countries must be censored
ns a matter of absolute necessity.
And so far as the boycott note by
this government is concerned, it is
understood that Fnuland will justify
her action on the ground that con
clusive proof was gathered against
American firms affected, showing
that their business was dominated
entirely by German capital.

In both cases, however, promises
are to be reiterated that every pre
caution is to be taken to protect the

this government can force relief in

slightest doubt that both Great
Britain and France would stand on
their rights under these treaties and

"WOMAN'S CODE"
Mrs. Adams Claims Clear Con
science in Shooting Al
leged Betrayer.
Iiiternation il News Service:
.malu.n, tia Aug. u itn a
revolver concealed In her skirt and
ready to shoot on sight, Mrs. II. C.
Adams, slayer of Capt. Kdgar Sprat-
ling, made a fruitless search for her
ictim nine days before she actually
slew him, according to developments
brought to light in the case today.
According to Miss Delia Hampton,
life-long friend of the slayer, Mrs.
Adams, tortured by the knowledge
that she was to become a mother,
unburdened her hert to her hus
band two weeks aco and demanded
then to kill Spratling. Next day she
secured a revolver and went to
Spratling's olfice in Atlanta, but he
had gone to the mobilization camp
at Macon. She kepi the revolver
until she came to Macon, where sho
carried out her determination.
The "woman's code" probably will
be added to the "unwritten law" a
a defense for homicide, according
to developments today. Mrs. Adams
declares she is mentally sound and
that her conscience alone prompted
her to kill Spratling. This statement
is borne out by the statement of
Miss Hampton. "Mrs. Adams is per
fectly sane," she declared. Her act
uas a woman's right and according
to the woman's code." The possibil
ity of this new defense being made
is attracting the attention of law
yers throughout the state. It is the
first time it has ever been advanced
In this state and jrobably in the
country.
