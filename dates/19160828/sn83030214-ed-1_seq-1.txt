"LUCIA" IS SUNG
AFTER A RIOT
_
Mob Scene Added to Opera
in Grand St. Theatre as
Receipts Disappear.
An Italian audience in the Grand
Street Theatre last night supplied the
opera "Lucia di Lammermoor" with a
mob scene, a particular which Cam-'
! marano overlooked when he wrote the
book for the piece.
It will be well, however, for maestros
1 who anticipate a production of the
i opera along these new lines to havr a
few building inspectors go over the
Opera house before they eall rehearsals.
j It is not every home of the singing
drama that is built to withstand such
strenuous "business." That the Grand
Street playhouse wasn't brought tum
bling down into Chrystie Street speaks
well for the men who built it.
To Antonio Dellorocha, it la asserted,
will go the credit for having gingered '
up this famous and melancholy opera.
Usnally Antonio is to be found baek
af the box office window in the Grand (
Street Theatre. but Antonio is else
wherc just now. It is said that about
$160. representing the "gate' at last .
night's novel performance, also has
gone. The alleged disappearance of :
Antonio and the $160 had much to do I
with the new mob scene.
Announcement Starts Trouble.
Two hundred Italians were in their
seats to witness the performance, which
was to raise money for the Italian ;
blind of New York. The direetor was
ready for the curtain wj-ien there ap?
peared behind the footlight.s l-'urico.
Enrico bore a troubled look, and he was
not worrving ahout having to stab him
aolf to death in the last act, either.
Knrico, in Italian, briefly announced ,
that Dellorocka, the cashier, had dis-i
appeared, also all the cash, and that
there would be no opera.
There wa6 no need for thunder in
the wings. The mob scene was suffi
cient in itself. In the mad push and
scramble for the box office seats were
broken, top hats smashed, gowns torn,
and the less sturdy music-lovers of- j
ten knocked down and trampled.
An alarm was sent to the nearest
police station nnd six detectives
hastened to tbe scene in an automo?
bile. Detectives and outraged opera
fans mi>:ed it generally, with no no
ticeabla abatement in the mob action
nntil Seliciano Acierno, of 948 Trin
ity Street, The Bronx, was able to
make himself heard.
Acierno, who is wealthy, pleaded for
silence.
"Keturn to your seats," he told the
throng. "1 have offered each member
of the east, the chorus, the orchestra
and the stage hands $2 apiece to go
ahead with the performance, and, gen
eronaly, they have accepted."
Acierno then added he would see what
could be done toward raising a fund
for the Italian blind. And so. revolu
tionized and rejuvenated, the perform?
ance of "Lucia" proceeded along the
lines laid down originally by Sir W'al
Scott.

PRESIDENT TO ASK ROADS
TO-DAY FOR MORE DELAY
In Meantime Executives Are Preparing for
War?Unions Expect to Keep Certain
Trains Running at All Events.
[From a Staff Correspondent of The Tribune.]
Washington, Aug. 27.?The four railway brotherhoods
have set in motion the wheels of a nation-wide strike. All the
union delegates except the four chiefs and a handful of their
lieutenants left Washington to-day with two envelopes in their
pockets. One of them contained a circular of ir.structions to
be followed if the threatened strike is called. The other, a
sealed one, contained the union code. That envelope is not to
be opened until the delegates receive from the four brotherhood
heads a code message setting the hour to strike.
In the meantime tentative plans for a joint session of
the Senate and House to hear President Wilson ask for legis?
lation to prevent the threatened nation-wide railroad strike
were djscussed by thePresident with Senator Kern, the Demo
critlc leadTr.'"To-nrght, wEen it aeemed virtually certain that
a break between the railroads and their employes must follow
final conferences at the White House to-morrow.
All Depends on To-day'? Me-eting.
Whether the plans considered by President Wilson and hii
advisers at the Capitol will be earried out depends upon to
morrow's developments, but it is understood that if all efforts
fail to bring the' employers and their men together the Presi?
dent will go before Congress and ask that it deal with the
situation. even if that necessitates indefinitely prolonging the
present session.
READY TO FACE
STRIKE, SAYS REA
Yielding Only Temporary
Postponement, Asserts
P. R. R. President.
Washington, Aug. 27.?Samuel Rca.
President of the Pennsylvania Railroad.
issued a statement to-night, which, for
the first time since the executives de?
cided upon the course they would pur
sue, flatly announced that rather give
up arbitration they regarded it as bet?
ter to faee a atrike. He declared that |
for the railroads to yield would result
in a temporary, but probably not a per
mament, postponement of the strike, j
_nd that the issue of arbitration at
stake in the present situation would be
left unsettled.
"These in brief," continued his state?
ment. "are the reasons why the heads
of the railways, with a full apprecia
tion of the sol'emn and weighty respon?
sibility resting on them, aa well as of
their duty to the public and to their
shareholders, have been foreed to the
conclusion that it is better to faee the
alternative of a strike than to surren?
der."
Mr. Rea went on to point out the
history of the struggles between rail?
roads and their employes, and spoke of
the depression which he said the rail?
roads had experienced recently. He
said that now, since they were having
their first real touch of prosperity for
M-veral years, they were confronted
with demands which would mean, when
followed by like demands from their
other employes, an added burden of
from $200,000,POO to $300,000,000 a year.
"Confronted by such conditions," he
conclu-kd, "?nd bome down by a aol
emn ae_se of their responsibility to
their employes, to business interesta of
all kinds. to the 100,000,000 people of
the I'nited States and to their stock-:
holders, what could the heads of the
railways do but refuse to yield, and
thea ealmly but resolutely faee the
possibihties of the situation in the full
confidence that their action will receive
the unqualtfied indorsement and sup?
port of the bueiness interests of the
country and the publie at large, who .
have as yet been denied all opportunity

Leipiic Openi Annual Fair.
Berlin, Aug. 27 (by wireless to Say-:
rille, N. Y. I. The autumn fair at Leip-1
sie was opened yesterday. The num?
ber of exhibitors is 2.800, which is
larger than is usual, even in times of
peace. A new section has been added
for the display of foodatuffa.
President Wilson also conferred
aU afternoon and part of the even?
ing with Franklin K. Lane, Seere?
tary of the Interior, one of the Pres?
idents closest advisers, and Senator
Newlands, chairman of the Senata
Interstate Commerce Committee.
Little could be learned about that
important meeting, but as a matter
of fact the three discussed two things
in paticular.
One was a plaa*- to keep certain
avenues of commerce open in the
event of a strike and the other waa
the question of keeping Congress in
session until the present cisis had
passed.
Employes Aet Promptly.
The employes caried out their ul
timatum on schedule time. Their
meeting this morning resulted in a
resolution giving the four brother?
hood chiefs, Austin B. Garretson,
Warren S. Stone, W. G. Lee and W.
S. Carter, power to act for the en?
tire 640 delegates. They are to carry
the negotiations with President Wil?
son to a conclusion. The Pesident
conrmunicated with them and re
ceived that assurance. But tha four
union officials have no power to ac?
cept anything that does not conceda
to the employes a basic eight-hour
day.
Crisis Expr. t?-.l To-day.
It would seem to-night that the
eountry's chances of avoi<v.ng a tie
up of all the roads involved?and
that means every great transporta?
tion system from coast to eoaat?de
pend on the outcome of to-morrow's
meeting between the President and
the railroad executives. President
Wilson has an appointment with thfl
raiload presidents at 10 o'clock.
They intend to present to him than
their counter proposal for aetUinc
the controversy. Whether ha arill
let them proceed with that plan of
