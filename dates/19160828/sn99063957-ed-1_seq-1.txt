May Cause Passage of Eight
Hour Day Law Covering
Railway Employes
By Robert J. Bender
(United Press staff correspondent)
Washington, Aug. 28. Presidont Wil
son today presented a new proposal
to the railroads of the country by
which he hopes to avert the threaten
ed final break between the roads and
railroad brotherhoods and the inevi
table industrial crisis that would fol
low. It was this new plan of the presi
dent's, it became known this afternoon
that resulted in deferring the confer
ence with the railroad presidents sched
uled far 10 o'clock at the White House.
It was likely to defer this conference
again beyond the hour of 2:30, the new
time set, it was indicated. It has be
come apparent the president did not in
tend to hear the so-called final terms of
the railway heads, while he considered
there was a possibility of obtaining
radical changes in the terms.
If the present effort fails, the pres-
dent will appeal to congress and if
possible secure the passage of two laws
that will delay ami possibly avert the
threatened strike, and prevent a recur
rence of such a situation.
The president still stands pat on his
demand for concession bv the railroads
of the principle of the eight hour day.
He Is willing, however, that sufficient
time should elapse before it is put into
effect to enable a commission of five
men to investigate and work out all
details regarding the application of
the shorter hour day to railroad op
eration a yeur if necessary.
Insists on Eight Hour Oif
From the first the president has been
insistent upon the eight hour day by
the proposition communicated to the
railroad executives today promises
them all the time necessary to allow a
thorough investigation of the short day
operation. The president has been will
ing and in this. It g learned today,
he has been supported by the railroad
employes to let all details of the uis
pute with the exception of the eight
hour day, be left to arbitration. Thus
far, however, the roads nave not ac-.
ceded to this, or any other of a score
of suggestions submitted to them.
Thus, it appears proliaule, according
to those in immediate touch with the
negotiations, that the railroads will not
yield to today s suggestion.
The president has determined if ne
gotiations fail to recommend the pas-
