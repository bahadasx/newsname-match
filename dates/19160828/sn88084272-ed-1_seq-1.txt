PELS EVERY

Texas Railroad Commission
Cancels Those Granted at
Hearings Last Year
Austu. Texas, Aug. 28. The railroad
commission today threw a bomb of
considerable proportion into the camp
of the Texas railroads when it issued
an order conceling, effective September
1 every advanced rate which had been
vraitte.i to the railroads, as a result of
the advanced freight rate hearing held
last year. This action was taken by
the commission in retaliation of the
action of the railroads in deciding to
ignore the Texas rate and complying
with the decision of the interstate
commerce commission as set out in the
Shreveport rate case. The order .
sued today is signed by all three
members of the commission.
Annner IlallrondR Haines.
At the recent conference held here
of the traffic and freight men in the
railroads, it was decided that these
Texas rates would be ignored and thar
the interstate rates would apply, which,
in many instances are higher than the
Texas rates. Chairman Mayfield salt!
soon afterward that he would proba
bly have an answer to make to this
action, and today's sweeping order is
the answer.
Consider Application Long Time.
The commission spent nearly a year
in considering the application of the
ailroads for a general advance in
freight rates, and as a result the cou -mission
advanced practically class and
commodity rates, in some instances the j
advance being about 15 percent. Now,
all this advance is canceled. The com
mission's order concludes: I
"It is further ordered that all tariffs !
and orders that were superseded by the j
tariffs and orders hereby canceled. I
be and the same are hereby reinstated." I
Old Tariff Itnfrx Ileinstated.
This means that all the old tariff
rates in effect before the hearing are
put back in force and effect. Today's
order is sweeping and applies on all
commodities involved.

Start Year on Cash BasI.
For the first time in a number of
years, the state will start the new fis
cal year on a firm cash basis and with
no indications of anv deficiency. There
w 11 be on the first of September over
t .0(10,000 in cash in the state treasury
t the credit of general revenue, and
the available school fund will have
. lost to Jl.0iin.000 to its credit. This
Ji.000,000 will be ample to carry on the
state's business until next January,
when 1917 taxes will be pouring into
the treasury department from tax col
lection. Despite the fait that the state
alvalorem tax rate has been reduced
from JO to 2" cents on the $100 property
valuation it is estimated there will
be more than sufficient revenue .o
meet all obligations as they become
due.
School Fund Has 1 .OOO.OOO.
With at least $1,000,000 to the credit
of the available school fund it will be
possible for an apportionment to be
made in September of not less than 75
cents per capita of scholastics, based -!!
1,240,000 scholastics. The annual per
capita apportionment is 7 this year.
Because of a deficit In the available
school fund, it was impossible to make
any apportionment at the beginning of

Ever since the war between Paraguay I

struggle against adverse circum- I

was literally wiped out of existence
before the allies were able to impose
