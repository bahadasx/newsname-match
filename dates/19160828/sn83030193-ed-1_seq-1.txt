they had prepared, although they had
full authority from the general con
ference to do so.
The meeting between Piesldeiit
Wilson and the executives was ex
pected to determlnu whether the

Ignored. If It has. u gtound will havo
been laid for his appearance before u

to-morrow.
After seeing the committee tho
President planned tn ism to the capi

Members of Congress weio study
ing the problem and waiting word
from President WlUon. No one ex
cept Senators who havo been In con
ference with the President has any
definite Idea of what he may ask Con
gress to do.
Some Progressive liepibllcau Sena
tors declared that, In their opinion, In
tha event of a strlku tho President
would ask Congress to direct Federal
receiverships to operuto tho railroads
during the conflict. Probability of
legislation for Oovcmment ownership
was too remote to bo considered In
