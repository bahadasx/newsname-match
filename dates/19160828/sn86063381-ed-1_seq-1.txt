3ible joint session to be summoned

Prepare for Strike.
Chicago, Aug 2 8 The executives
ct western railroads who are not in
Washington are making quiet pre
parations to meet the situation if
the four brotherhoods declare a
3trike Practically all of the roads
have canvassed their employes and
have lists of all men not belonging to
the brotherhoods who would be capa
ble of operating an engine These
lists include former engineers, con
ductors and firemen who now hold
official positions with the company
men who have formerly been in the
service, but who have entered other
lines ot work, and railroad employes
who are not affiliated with the broth
erhoods
In addition to this there has been
for several days a mysterious move
ment into Chicago of men known to
have figured in previous strikebreak
ing operations who are believed to
have been assembled by the railroads
although this is neither admitted by
the men or by the railroad officials
Operating heads of railways seek
ing strikebreakers, admitted today
that thev had placed guards on the
Minnesota Mesaba range to secure
strikebreakers A majority of the
reads do not expect a strike They
believe that negotiations will drag
along for six or seven weeks more.

way, from New Orleans to Winnipeg.
The road established from the
south goes by way of Clearbrook and
returns by way of Gonvick From
the north the road goes by way of
Gonvick and returns by way of
Clearbrook. The roads were found
to be in good condition.
The tour was the largest sociability
ru ever held in this section, with
so many different towns being Tep
resented
At the Red Lake agency the visit
ors were given an excellent enter
tainment.

Beunos Aires, Aug. 1(By Mail)
South America's republics today
are sitting over just such another
powder magazine as the one wheh ex
ploded two years ago in Europe. In
many ways the situation recalls the
situation existing in Europe just a
few years before the outbreak of the
present struggle. The recent hint of
war between Venezuela and Peru and
Columbia and Ecuador brought South
America to sharp attention. They
might easily do what the Balkan
mixup did to Europe.
There is the same feeling that a
widespread clash cannot be prevent
ed, the same conflict of interest, same
warning, same preparations, same
groaning under the weight of these
preparations and the same undercur
rent of inter-national ill-feeling.
If and when war comes the two
principal beligerents probably will be
Argentina and Chile.
Boundary Disputes
Not a country in South America
lacks a boundary dispute with some
other country. Each is a little Al
sace-Lorraine.
Chile and Argentina had a nasty
dispute of the kind in 1898. It
reached the point of mutual mobiliz
ation England interfered and ar
bitrated. Argentina got a large area
of land in Southern Patagonia which
Chile claimed should have gone to the
latter. This has rankled ever since.
Chili is very poor. If he could take
by force of arms, that land, she might
get another portion as indemnity. It
would give her all of South America
along her present Eastern boundary
as far South as the latitude of the
Chubuk River, which is about 1,000
miles North of Cape Horn, and thence
to the southward, the whole contin-
TWO KILLED IN ADTO
RACES AT KALAMAZOO
Car Skids and.11 Cars Crash Effort
Made to Get Jewett to Enter
Race.
(By United Press)
Kalamazoo, Mich., Aug 28 Two
drivers were killed and eight were
injured yesterday when 11 of 14
racing automobiles piled up at the
first turn of the 100-mile auto race
track at Recreation park. The first
car with Jack Peabody skidded and
started the procession.
Efforts were made last week by the
Kalamazoo race authorities to secure
the entry of W. Jewett into the
race with his "Ford Special." Mr.
Jewett turned down the offer
UNIQUE WINDOW DISPLAY

South American Countries
OnBrinkofWar Situation
Similar to That In Europe
A P/lfl
ent, from the Pacific to the Atlantic.
Chile. Rich Nation
This would transform Chile into a
moderately rich nation, for Southern
Patagonia is a fine cattle country and
there are stories of rich petroleum
deposits there.
This would mean war with Argen
tina.
Here is where Peru would get into
the situation. In 1879, as a result of
a war, Chile annexed the two south
ern Peruvian provinces. Peru has
been longing ever since for a chance
to get them back.
Bolivia is an inland country with
an ambition for a "window" on the
Pacific.
The two provinces Chile took from
Pacific and on the East by Bolivia.
On their coast are the ports of Tacna
and Arica. These would constitute a
"double window" if Bolivia could get
them.
Chile probably would turn them
over to the Bolivians to defend from
Peru.
Peru Too Strong
Peru would be too strong for Boliv
ia, but Ecuador and Columbia would
help give Peru a tronucing to keep the
latter from trying to enforce claim on
parts of the Putumayo rubber coun
try, concerning which Sir Roger Case
ment made a report a few years ago.
Parenthetically, Columbia claims
certain territory in northern Peru
and surely would think the time fav
orable for grabbing it.
This would be the cure for Peru's
friend, Venezuela, to invade Columbia
and secure a slice of territory she
covets
North of Argentina is Paraguay.
The Paraguayans have lost territory
to Argentina and are wild to revover
it Many South Americans believe
Paraguay could count on military
support from Brazil.
