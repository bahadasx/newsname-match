all the impetus given it is that firaish

The voters, themselves, are paying]

the anti-suffrage contingent in south

strong as the suffragists, and really
more active in political mutters.

Avenue.
Mrs. Clara Eyster Barns, aged 86,
wife of the late Newton S. Barns, and
a pioneer resident of this city, died Sat
urday afternoon at 3:40 o'clock at her
home on Fairmont avenue, after a
period of invalidism extending through
several years, during part of which
time she was able to go about her
home.
Early last March, Mrs. Barns suf?
fered a severe attack of Illness and
for days her life was despaired of,
however she rallied to some extent,
though had never been able to leave
her bed. On Sunday, August 20, she
suffered a sinking spell from which
she did not recover. During the long
years of her Invalidism, Mrs. Barns
has been the object of the tenderest
solicitude by her large circle of friends
in this city and from her immediate
family she was the recipient of all the
loving care that can be bestowed.
While obliged to give up any active du
ties about the home, she kept up with
current events and always displayed
keen Interest In family affairs, "her

Governor Hatfield's Sharp
Telegram About Capt.
Lee's Report.
(Speclnl Dinpntch to Wont Virginian)
WASHINGTON, D. C., Aug. 28?
There haB been no Federal aid of the
flood sufferers In the Kanawha yet.
There will not be until Secretary of
War Baker, who has been campaign
ing in Maine, returns and passes on
the case himself. A report is on file
at the war department quoting Gover
nor Hatfield as declining assistance
from the national government. This
report is strenuously denied by Gover
nor Hatfield in a telegram sent to Con
gressman Littlepage to an inquiring
wire sent to the governor by Mr. Lit
tlepage.
A report submitted t0 the War De
partment by Major T. H. Jackson, of
the engineers corps, stationed at
Wheeling, after stating that Capt.
Lee had made a personal investigation
of the stricken region, says, paragraph
3: "From this information it is be
lieved that Federal aid is not need
ed. The Governor of West Virginia
stated t0 Capt. Lee, as the latter v/as
leaving the district, that Fedoral aid
had not been asked and that it was not
necessary."
It was this which caused Congress
man Littlepago who was the author!
of the relief resolution passed by;
Congress to rush a telegram to Gover
nor Hatfield, which read as follows:
"Captain C. H. Lee of corps of en
gineers of war department ,who inves
tigated conditions in the flooded dis
trict of Cabin Creek and Coal river,
has reported to the war department
that while he was leaving the district
the Governor of West Virginia had
stated to him that Federal aid had not
been asked by the state and that it
was unnecessary. Pleaso wire imme
diately whether he quotes you correct
ly."
The prompt reply from the Governor
to the above read:
"On August 12th I wired Sena
tor Chilton that we would be ap
preciative of anv service the Fed
eral government might render.
Such posts as Capt. Lee, who came
into our state and without calling
on the Governor or Adjutant Gen
eral, who arc familiar with the
situation, attempts to cover 2000
square miles of flooded area in two
days period paying a hurried call
on the governor as h0 was leaving
the district would I feel tend to
disgust the officials of any state,
as well as those who have been
so unfortunate as to be flood suf
ferers. I can do no better than
to repeat to you my message to
Senator Chilton that the unfortu
nate people would, I am sure, be
grateful for any contribution to
them the Federal government
cares to make, i was not cor
rectiy quoted to you."
Upon receipt of this telegram from
Governor Hatfield, Congressman Lit
tlepage immediately took it to the
officials at the War department. He
demanded immediate Federal help as
provided in his resolution, which tho
President signed last Thursday. Noth
ing was done, however, with Mr Lit
tlepage's demands except to defer
them until Secretary Baker returns
from Maine. He was expected to be
at his desk here today.
No $9000 Case Against
Sniders and Neptune
Bat one order was entered this morn
ing in Intermediate Court altbougb a
number of matters wore under consid
eration, and It was expected that other
decisions would be announced by
Judge Vincent this evening. This was
the case of The Farmers Bank of
Shlnnston against L. D. Snider, T. S.
Neptune and Joseph Snider, and Judg
ment tor the plaintiff was granted for
the sum of 9142.66. An error was made
in the report of this case in Saturday's
Issue of this paper. The sum was stat
ed as $9,000 instead of *142.65. M. W.
Ogden appeared for the plaintiff in
this suit.
