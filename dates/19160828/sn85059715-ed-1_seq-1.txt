I BRRLIN, Aug. 2S.? Kouthahia declared
war on Austria-Hungary nn
Bunday evening, it is announced ollicially
here.
iHouiuaniu thus becomes the fourteenth
nation to join the war. Its
intervention cither on the side of theI
Allies or the Central powers has been
nwaited with symptoms of concern byI
both sides since tiie beginning of the
great conflict. This is due, not entirely
to Roumanla's military
|| strength but also to the strategic advantages
of its geographical position,
nnd the fact that its entry Into the

gateway through Jlouninnla to attack
the Bulgarians from tho north,
while the Allied army, having its base
at Saloniki, attacks thorn and their
German allies from the south,
f Fair Military Strength.
Nevertheless Koiintania's military,
? strength is by no means inconsiderable.
The country has a population1
of 6,S00,0Ud and its army has been
estimated at 580,000. it often has
been described as one ol the most
thoroughly equipped anil disciplined
armies in Europe. but recent Infnr-j
mation from Liucharest lias thrown
some doubt upon its quality. Lately
It has been stated that Iloumania of^
- beers are ill trained and undisciplined.
that iiuiimanla has no heavyartillery
and that its flying service is
Inferior. Some advocates of lioumanin's
participation in the war have
'i asserted that it could mobilize as
, many as 1.000,000 men. The mobil'
Ization of Its army has been in progf
rcss for months and a few clays ago
; was reported to be complete.
The motive which prompts Hon'
mania to enter the war is the satist
faction of its "national aspirations."
described by Take Joncscu, the Itoumanian
Liberal leader, as (lie "policy
of national instinct;" concisely
(his means national expansion. In
(lie southern half of Iiukowina, tlie
Austrian crown land, the Roumanians
"? - nf
are the dominant race, ir m..,- ?.
the people of eastern Transylvania, a
part of Hungary, is Roumanian by
race and language. H is said -1,000,000
Roumanians live in Transylvania.
Covets Provinces.
Roumania has been credited with
1 long cherished ambition to annex
these provinces and at the same time
"liberate" the Roumanians now unler
Austrian domination. Recently
It was reported Russia has offered
Czernowitz to Roumania as a reward
If it would unite with the Entente. I
Roumania also covets llassarabia,
!he extreme southwestern province of
Russia ou the Black sea, which was
("ken from il by tho Berlin treaty j
of J S78.
Roumania lias a borderline as long
as the whole Russian western war
front on which to choose its points of
military attack. In what direction ilfirst
blow may be aimed is indicated
by its desire to pour its troops'
I through the passage of (lie Transylvania
Alps anil the Carpulhians into
Transylvania.
On the other hand Austria lias been
accumulating military forces at Orrova,
prepared to attempt to force
I the "iron gates" where the Danube
I river touches the western Roumanian
I border. Bulgaria is said to have >iaI
Honed 100,000 or more troops along
I the southern banlc of tho Danube to
I protect its northern frontier front a
