THROWS 600,000
MEN INTO FRAY
AGAINST KAISER
LONDON, Aug. 28. —Rumania has
joined the allies, with her well trained army
of 600,000 men.
One official statement from Berlin this
afternoon announced that Rumania declared
war on Austria last night. The French for
eign office announced that Rumania has de
clared war against the central powers.
Within a few hours after Rumania en*
tered the war, her frontier forces clashed
with enemy patrols along the Transylvanian
frontier. The German war office this after
noon announced that some Rumanian pris
oners were taken.
Germany will diimi*s the Rumanian
minister to Berlin today, according to an Ex
change telegraph dispatch from The Hague*
There is every indication that Germany
will follow Rumania's action with a declara
tion of war before many hours.
Rumania's declaration was reached at a
meeting of the crown council, summoned by
King Ferdinand last night. It came at ihC
end of two years of anxious waiting in which
the Rumania diplomats watched with tensa
interest the military fortunes of the allies.
The Rumanian declaration is expected to
signal Greece's early entrance into the war
on the side of the allies.
Pro-ally enthusiasm, fanned to
f»>ver heat by the Bulgarian Inva
sion of northern c.reece. broke out
in series of great meetings in
Athens Sunday. King Con stan tine
was denounced for falling to lend
support to the allies, and was urged
|to prepare the army for war
The Rumanian third army, al
ready mobilized within striking
distance of the Hungarian frontier.
Is expected to invade Transylvania
before the end of the week, striking
westward toward Besztercze.
Transylvania Coveted
The Rumanian general ataff
probably will send every available
man In the Invaalon of Hungary In
an effort to conquer Tranaylvanla
long coveted by the Rumanian*. At
the same time a strong force will
be maintained along the aouthern
Rumanian frontier to guard against
attack bv the Bulgarian*.
Rumania* decision is expected
to be folio* ed shortly by the open
in* of a (treat allied offensive In
the Balkans that will aim to
squee»e the Rlilg*r* between t«o
opposing forces. closing the path
way the Germans cut thru Serbia to

believed, since Rumania and Italy
had acted In concert In other
Balkan matters, and were under*
stood to have agreed more than a
,vi ar ago to Join the allies at tha
same time.
News of the allied diplomatic vio
tory at Bucharest waa hailed with
the greatest enthuslaam in London,
(everywhere the view was taken
that Rumania's entrance Into tha
war means the speedy elimination
of both Austria and Bulgaria from
the conflict.
To Hasten War's End
Squeezed between the victorious
Russian and Italian armies, tha
Austrian* now find themselves
forced to defend their eastern bor*
der from attack at a moment when
they lack men for the Russian and
lullan fronts. Allied military ex
perts are confident that Germany
will be unable to send any rein,
forcementa to the aid of the hard
i ressed Austrians without Inviting
disaster on both the Russian and
Anelo KVench fronta.
Some critics *ee, aa a result of
Rumania's action, the shutting oft
of Bulgaria and Turkey from com*

man allies, and their surrender
under economic and military
presaure before the end of the pre a*
ent year.
enabling her to concentrate her
maximum effort against Italy,
said an official statement to
day.
A similar statement was forward*
ed to the German foreign office
thru the Swiss government, setting
forth the reason for the declaration
of war yesterday.
Excepting the capture nf Gorlt*,
no event of several montUs has so
stirred the Italian public as the
news of Italy's challenge, to the
kaiser. Newspapers flashed the
word to the Sunday holiday crowds,
and an enormous throng quickly
gathered In Piazza Colonna.
A great procession formed and pa
raded thru the streets, shouting
"Down with Germany" and "1-ong
live the allies." until midnight.
The decision of war against Ger
many followed by but a few hours
a royal decree confiscating the his
toric Palazzo de Venezla, which, for
centuries, had constituted virtually
an Austrian province in the heart
of Rome.
The Palazzo, a square of land
with two ancient palaces, was the
property of the pope, but in 1560
was presented to the republic of
Venice by I'ope Plus IX. It later
came Into the possession of Austria
and was the home of the Austrian
embassy The embassy documents
were sent to the Vatican (or Mte
