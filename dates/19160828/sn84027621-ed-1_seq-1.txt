PREDETERMINED PLAN
London, Aug. 28. No indications
have been received of the immediate
effect on the Balkan military situa
tion by the Rumanian declaration of
war against Austria-Hungary, or
. moves already made on both sides.
Indication that Rumania moved ac
cording to a predetermine dplan is
found in the fact that her war decla

was announced. The German federal
council, which must consent to any
war other than of a defensive nature,
has been called to meet immediately.
The censors are releasing but little
news of the Macedonian campaign.

SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT
Editor Star: Let's keep the record
straight. In your issue of Friday last
you state that Mr. Knott is 410 votes
ahead of Mr. Catts on the recount. My
understanding is that Mr. Knottj
claims to have gained 410 votes on the
recbunt but you would "have to deduct
Mr, Catts' lead of 2C0 from the above
in order to get the number he claims
now to be ahead, which would be 150
instead of 410.
In considering this let's not forget
that Mr. Knott's lawyers in Gaines
ville had the vote in Alachua precinct,
which was overwhelming for Mr.
Catts thrown out so far as it applied
for governor on a technicality, while
three other precincts which gave Mr,
Knott pluralities were accepted and
counted although the same technical
ities prevailed.
Also let us not lose sight of- the
fact that in the recount in Madison,
Suwanee and Hamilton counties that
several of the inspectors made affi
davits that the" ballots the , courts
made them canvass in July was not
the same ballots they canvassed June

Formidable Attempt of Turks to Re
gain Ezerum Met with.
Failure
Petrograd, Aug. 28. The Turkish
attempt to encircle the left flank of
the Russian Caucasian army appears
to have received a crushing blow from
the troops of Grand Duke Nicholas in
the region of Lake Van.
The Turkish scheme of encircling
the left flank and regaining Ezerum,
thus nullifying all the successes of
the grand duke in Turkish Armenia,
appeared to be well on its way to a
successful outcome, but the Russian
reoccupation of. Mush and their re-
establishment of, their positions west
of Lake Van apparently has put a
definite end to the ambition of the
Turks. The initiative now appears
again to be with the Russians at all
important points in Asia Minor, and
now that the Turkish offensive on the
left flank has been stopped Grand
Duke Nicholas can continue his march
toward Asia Minor.
The task of turning the left flank of
the Russians in Southern Armenia and
Western Persia was intrusted to the
Mush group of the Turkish forces,
which were reinforced by troops from
every part of European and Asiatic
Turkey until they far outnumbered
the Russian army opposing them and
began the northeastern drive in the
direction of Ezerum.
Although constantly halted by the
Russian fire and forced to send in a
continuous stream of reserves to re
pair the ravages to their lines caused
by Russian counter attacks, the Turks
appeared early In August, after the
oc cupation of Mush and Bitlis and the
successful expedition into Persian
territory as far as Hamadan, to be in
a fair way toward accomplishing the
task which they had undertaken.;
The turning point came soon after
the Turkish occupation of Muslv when
the Russian line in that neighborhood
stiffened suddenly. The battle begun
then continued uninterruptedly until
yesterday,4 when the Turkish forces,
despite their reported superiority in
numbers, fell back under the British
assault, conducted from the regions of
Melasguerd and Gniskala, and left
Mush again in Russian hands.
The defeat of this group of - the
Turkish forces is considered by mili
tary critics here to be of great im
portance, because upon the Turkish
ability to hold Mush and use it. as a
base of operations against the Rus
sian left wing the success of their en
tire campaign in this region was
predicated.
The expedition, which the Turks
sent out from Rivandouza toward
Persia is an apparent attempt to dis
tract the attention of the Russians
from the main theater of operations,
likewise came to grief near Rachta,
where two regiments were captured
by the Russians, according to war of
fice statements.
The new offensive movement of the
Russians in Southern Turkish Ar
menia is being developed energetical
ly. The war office reported today that
the Russian troops are continuing the
attack west of Lake Van.
"Our offensive west of Lake Van is
continuing," the statement reads. "In
the direction of Mosul we are pursu
ing the remnant of the dispersed
Turkish divisions."

INFORMATION FOR VOTERS
Editor Star: The primary, law as
enacted by the legislature of 1913 re
quired a biennial registration which
constant registration not being popu
lar with the people the legislature of
1915 amended that part of the law so
as to read as follows:
"That all persons who have hereto
fore registered or who may hereafter
register under the provisions of chap
ter 6469 of the laws of Florida, acts
of 1913,. in election precincts which
are not located wholly or in part
within a city or more than twenty
thousand population shall be deemed
duly registered for all general pri
mary elections and so long as they
continue to reside in the election pre
cinct in which they so registered and
their names shall be carried upon the
registration books as 'electors, duly
registered for such elections."
After the passage of this amend
ment I have acted in accordance
thereto, and transcribed the names
from the primary books to the books
used in -all general and special elec
tions, if such names were not already
on these books, and I have repeatedly
stated to the people of this county
that when they have registered on the
primary books that that registration
would entitle them not only to vote in
the primary elections but all other
elections. Now that the validity of
thi samendment as to registration for
all elections other than the primary
has been questioned, I submit here
with the opinion of the attorney gen
eral and ask the voters of the county
to read and govern themselves ac
cordingly. D. M. Barco,
, Supervisor of Registration.
Attorney General's Opinion
Of course I do not say that this
provision of the statute is invalid. I
only undertake to demonstrate that it
may be so held by the courts, and I
do say that there is room for doubt
of its validity and that since this is
true the safe course for an elector is
to see to it that he is duly registered
upon the registration books for gen
eral elections so that if it should be
held that the registration for primary
elections is not a sufficient registra
tion for general elections, he would
not be denied the right to vote in the
general election.
This is advisable for another reas
on, namely: if, after the general elec
tion is held, the question of whether
or not electors who had registered
on the registration books for primary
elections but had not registered on
the registration books for general
elections were qualified to vote in the
general election, was raised and it
should be held that such registration
was not sufficient, great uncertainty
and dissatisfaction would probably
follow.
For this reason I am suggesting
that all electors register just as if
the registration books for primary
elections were not in existence. Of
course, if an elector has heretofore
registered in the registration books
for general elections, it will not be
necessary to do so again.
Respectfully, T. F. West,
Attorney General.

PLAN SUGGESTED BY PRESIDENT VILSOIl DOES

(Associated.
Washington, August 28 President
Wilson's negotiations for averting the
threatened nation-wide railway strike
is in the last stage. A break or set
tlement is apparently near, with the
railroads standing firm against an
eight-hour day and the brotherhood
leaders still standing against arbitra
tion. The hope of preventing a tie-up
seems with Congress. What Congress
can do none of the leaders seem to
know.
Conferences begun last night con
tinued today. President Wilson post
poned his engagement with the rail
way executives until this afternoon in
order to gain time for conferences.
The situation viewed on all sides is
the most perilous since the negotia
tions began. Hope lay in the possi
bility that the- president and the ad
ministration might get the men to
give more time in which to negotiate.
PRESIDENTS PLAN DISCUSSED
President Wilson's plan to break the
deadlock in the railroad strike' situa
tion discussed at conferences today in
cludes an eight-hour law for railroads
to be effective long enough in the fu
ture to allow the railroads to prepare
and for the passage of a law creating
an investigation commission and pre
venting lockouts and strikes pending
investigation, which 'was discussed as
the next step after the managers
formally refuse the president's for
mer plan.
CONGRESS IS STUCK
Hope of adjourning Congress this
week has been abandoned.
DETERMINED ON THE EIGHT-
HOUR DAY
The brotherhood men have gone
home, leaving twenty-four of their
number to handle the situation. W. G.
Lee, at the head of the trainmen, de
clared the brotherhoods had no inten
tion of arbitrating the eight-hour
day.

CATTS INSULTS FL6rIDA GIRLS
(Gainesville Sun)
In his speech at Morrocco Temple
in Jacksonville on the night of Au

he did not know whether or not it
was the case in Jacksonville, but that
it was true over the state that the
high, school" girl graduates seemed to
know of nothing else to do but stand
around the corners waiting for some
one to set'em up to a drink and to
show how low they could cut their
dresses at the top and how high they
cculd cut them at the bottom. He al
so said that many of them were hunt
ing for joyriders, and that they did
not care whether their escorts were
married or single. . , ' -
Fathers and brothers, how do you
like this placing of your daughters
and sisters on a level with the inhab
itants of the red light districts of the
cities? Mr. Catts "did not know
whether thi3 was the case in Jackson
ville, but it was true over the state
This is to say that it may not be
true of Jacksonville high school grad-,
uates, but that it is true of our own
Gainesville girl graduates, as well as
of the graduates of every other high
school in Alachua county. In Ocala
Mr. Catts said he "did not know
whether this was the case in Ocala,
but it was true over the state, which
included Jacksonville.
The Sun is not aware of any of
the high school, girl graduates of
Alachua county sinking to the level
Mr. Catts says they have, and we de
fy him- to cite a single case of the
kind. It is a foul slander upon the
fair young women of Florida, and
should be resented by every man in
the state. ,
