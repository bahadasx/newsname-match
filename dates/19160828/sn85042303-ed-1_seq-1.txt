Roumania to Make Attack.

general staff officers believe that Bul

According to war de

make the supply problem difficult.

J. n. White and Kirk Dyer, two of
the members of the committee re
cently chosen to visit cities In the
northern states, and inspect the con
vention halls, returned Saturday night
and are preparing their report and
suggestions for the guidance of the
city officials here, when they begin
the erection of the convention hall re
cently authorized.
I if ho fcoon tntimated that they
i . .
will include in their report the in
stallation of a maple floor which can
be used for balls and a skating rink,
so that the hall will be a source of
revenue rractically the entire year.
Just when work on the new struc
ture will begin has not been deter
mined, but it is thought that work will
be well under way before the first of

essential conveniences.
Washington. D. C, Aug. 28.
President Wilson's plan for
breaking the deadlock be
tween the railroads and the
employes as ediscussed in th
conference today was an eight
hour law for the railroads, ef
fective at a date far enough in
the future to give the railroads
opportunity to prepare for it
and a law patterned after the
Canadian act, which creates a
commission of investigation
and prevents lockouts or
strikes, while an industrial dis
pute is being arbitrated.
Washington, D. C, Aug. 28.
President Wilson's negotia
tions for averting the threaten
ed nation-wide railroad strike,
are in the last stage with a
break or settlement apparently
not far off.
With the executives standing
firm against conceding the
eight-hour day and the broth
erhood leaders still standing
out against arbitrating the
eight-hour question, hope of
preventing a tie-up of the coun
try's transportation systems
seems to lie with congress.
The president postponed his
meeting with the railroad ex
ecutives, scheduled for 10:00
o'clock this morning, until 2:30
this afternoon, to give him
more time to confer with the
congressional leaders.
Tentative plans for a joint
session of the senate and house
to hear president Wilson ask
for legislation to prevent the
strike were discussed last night

miles, hurling a projectile weighing

amount of high explosive.
In addition to placing several of
these mammoth weapons along the
coast line for mobile defense against
a naval attack, army officials now
are considering the creation of a spec
ial regiment, equipped with six of the
howitzers, to work as a unit of the
mobile army. The problem confront
ing the designers in that regard Is to
distribute the enormous weight of the

it can be moved over any good road.
That difficulty is a determining fac

has many sections so lightly built
that the great weight would crash

For those reasons, it is planned to
build the new howitzers primarily for
transportation by rail on special cars.
