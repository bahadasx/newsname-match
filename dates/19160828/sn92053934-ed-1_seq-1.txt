THE WAR TODAY
Rumania's declaration of war
Hsraitist Austria was followed swift
ly bv military action. Today's of
ficial German announcement Indi
cates that a new campaign, along1
the Hungarian-Rumanian frontier
is under wav. The statement says
Rumanians have been taken pris
oner. Rumania lias entered the war
with the entente allies. Oriicial
aiinciincement is made at Berlin
that the existence of a state of
war with Austria-Hungary was
proclaimed in Bucharest yester
day evening. .
The. military situation in the
Balkans now becomes of prepon
derant importance. It Is to be ex
pected Rumania will follow a plan
of campaign mapped out. by the
high council or Uie entente pow
ers, whether airainst Austria-Hungary
or Buluaria, or both. An in
dication that Rnmania moved in
accordance with a pre-determlned
plan of the entente allies is found
in the fact that her declaration of
war was made on the same day as
Italy's declaration against Or-
many. . .

Paris, Ang. 2. The Germans

day's -war office announcement.
London, Aug. 28. Artillery fighting
is in progress along the Macedonian
front but no infantry actions of im

indicated by today's official account
which follows.
"On our Doiran front our artillery
silenced the enemy's guns which were
bombarding our positions.
"On the Struma front the Bulgar
ians shelled Mekis and we dispersed
an enemy working party northeast of
Komarjan."
Appeal to Grecian King.
Athens, Aug. 27, (via London, Aug.
2S, 1:30 a. m.) Fifty thousand Greeks
joined in a demonstration before the
residence of Venizelos, the former
premier, today and cheered him with
boundless enthusiasm when he urged
them to send a committee to King
Constantino to urge bim 1q support the
present government and prepare th-3
army for a "possible rupture of exist
ing conditions." Addressing the mul
titude, Venizelos said:
' Last week I summoned you to a
demonstration to show you what to do.
Now I exhort you to send a committee
before the king and to say to him:
" 'Your majesty, you were the vic
tim of persons who persuaded you
there would be a German victory and
you thought you could violate the con
stitution. The people do not approve
of these facts. The reservists tele
graph you that they are ready to fol
low you, because they think you al
ways will remain neutral.
" 'Elections are necessary, but you
must not use your influence political
ly, because the results would be de
structive. The present government is
absolutely necessary. The premier
(Alexander Zaimis) is an excellant
man. You should give the government
full political authority. Y'ou must now
show the entente powers most benev
olent neutrality and exercise the army
in preparation for a possible rupture
of existing conditions. The liberal
party is confident as regards your po
sition.' "
Concluding. Venizelos declared: "I
think our desire will be favorably ac
cepted; otherwise I will do my best."
Repressed Over Situation.
The landing of the first contingent
of Italian troops at Chimara, a small
seaport of Albania on the Strait of
Otranto, causes gloom throughout all
Greece. The Greeks now see not only
eastern Macedonia in the hands of the
Bulgars, whom they expelled from
there three years ago. but northern
Epirus in the hands of the Italians.
Following the landing of the Ital
ian troops, the Greek civil officers were
temporarily relieved of their functions
and the telegraph wires were cut, but
this damage was soon repaired.
M. l'achitch. the former Serbian
premier, has gone to Chalkis to pay his
respects to King Peter.
Turkish Drive Checked.
Washington, Aug. 28. The Turkish
drive toward Persia aimed apparently
to outflank the Russian armies oper
ating in Armenia is reported in dis
patches received here today, to have
been held up at Woe by heavy Russian
reinforcements.
The foreign legations it. Teheran,
though still disturbed, have not yet fled
from the city. This report, taken in
conjunction with the recent Russian
successes at Bitlis and Mush, is inter
preter! as removing danger of a Turk
ish outflanking movement against Rus
sia or of an invasion of Persia.

Follows War
by Rumania
Chicago, Aug. 2S. Rumania's decla
ration of war smashed the wheat mar
ket. Opening prices today showed a
fall in iine cfses er".o;inting to 5siC
j -uhbiii. rhipiuuiber delivery, which.
! closed Saturday at $1.51K4, started to
day at $1.46 to $1.48. Other options
also broke wildly.
General rushes to sell took place,
which increased by the increased
chances of a general railway strike in
the United States.
Before the descent of prices could
be checked, losses that reached to 8'i
cents a bushel were shown for the
principal trading month, December,
which sold as low as $1.45l2 as com
pared with $1.54 at Saturday's finish.
In the late dealings, weakness again
became acute. Prices tumbled lower
than before and closed 9c to HUc
net lower with September at $1.401i
to $1.4094 and December at $1.43 to
$1.44 ?s. the extreme break of the ses
sion. News that actual fighting between
the Rumanians and the Teutons had
already begun accompanied the final
downturn in prices and made the trad
ing at tha finish a frantic whirl of ex

Paris, Aug. 2S, (12:40 p. m.) Ru

council held at Bucharest yesterday

Geneva.
The Wolff agency announces that
the German federal council was con
voked immediately after the decision
was made known.
Rumania Is the fourteenth nation to
Join in the war. Her - Intervention
either on the side of the entente allies
or the central powers has been await
ed with symptoms of concern by both
since the beginning of the great con
flict. This is due not entirely to Ru
mania's military strength but also to
the strategic advantages of her geo
graphical position and the fact that
her entry into the struggle opens to
the Russian army a gateway through
Rumania to attack the Bulgarians from
the north, while the allied army having
its base at Salonikl attacks them and
their German allies from the south.
Nevertheless, Rumania's military
strength is by no means inconsiderable.
The country has a population of 0,800,
000 and her army has been estimated
at 560,000. It often has been described
as one of the most thoroughly equip
ped and disciplined armies 1n Europe
but recent information from Bucharest
has thrown some doubt upon its qual
ity. Later it has been stated that Ru
manian officers are ill-trained and un
disciplined, that Rumania has no heavy
artillery and that Its flying service Is
inferior. Some advocates of Rumania's
participation in the war have asserted
that she could mobilize as many as one
million men. The mobilization of the
army, in progress for months, was a
few days ago reported to be complete.
.Motive for War.
The motive which prompts Rumania
to enter the war Is the satisfaction of
her "national aspirations," described
by Take Jonescu, the Rumanian liberal
leader, as the "policy of national in
stinct." Concisely this means national
expansion. In the southern half of
Hukowlna the Austrian crownland, the
Rumanians are the dominant race. The
mass of the people of eastern Transyl
vania, a part of Hungary, Is Rumanian
by race and language. It Is said 4,000,.
000 Rumanians live in Transylvania.
Rumania has been credited with a
long cherished ambition to annex these
provinces, and at the same time "lib
erate" the Rumanians now under Aus-
tContlnued on Pago Twelve.)
