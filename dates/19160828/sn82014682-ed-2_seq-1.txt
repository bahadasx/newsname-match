Brig.-Gen. R. K. Evans, commanding
the Hawaiian Department, and Brig.
Gen. Samuel I. Johnson, commanding

Albert F. Judd, former territorial
senator, in a letter recently written to
Supervisor Francis M. Hatch, strongly
urges greater powers of self-govern
ment for Honolulu,
lie declares in favor of a more cen
tralized and responsible municipal
government, reducing the number of
elective officers to the mayor, super
visors and auditor.
He tirees that the city have the
right to fix the tax-rate, that the city
have much broader powers of con
demning private property for public
purposes, andT that the officials
named by the people be given greater
authority otherwise.
In response. Supervisor Hatch
wrote a brief note expressing himsell

views, and adding that he hopes Judd

Senator JudcTs Letter.
August 14, 1916.
Hon. F. M. Hatch, Kalakaua Ave.,
. Honolulu, T. H.
My dear Mr. Hatch: Your attitude
of service to the public as shown
by your accepting a position on t
Board of Supervisors of the City an
County of Honolulu, has caused much
favorable comment I venture .to
write you on the subject of why the
leaders of Honolulu s commercial and
ether affairs (excluding things po
litical) .. have not yet come forward
in any numbers ready to serve the
City as public servants, These men
are free with their criticisms at all
times, especially those who ride in
automooiles over our bumpy roads.
or those who have to bathe in Nuuanu
water, and the criticism -f generally
ends up in a vigorous condemnation
of the "personnel of the Board of
Supervisors. i ,
I : consider such criticism short
sighted and not comprehensive.
We have a municipal organization
which is not as efficient as the mem
bers of the Honolulu business com
munity would wish, but the fault is
argely that of . the people of Hono
ulu and not of the supervisors.
The history, of the evolution of
ocal self-government in Hawaii from
strong central government is ex
tremely Interesting but this Is not

How Rumania can strike at the flank of Austria-Hungary as the
latter opposes Russia, and at the back of Bulgaria as the latter moves
down into the lower part of Serbia and Greek Macedonia, is shown in
the map be'ow. Transylvania, which Rumania covets, is also shown,
as well as Bessarabia, held by Russia,, and which Rumania has given
up nopes of getting. Through the Transylvanian Alps and the Car
pathians there are several passes by which Rumania is already
striking at the enemy.

that all the German submarines which
