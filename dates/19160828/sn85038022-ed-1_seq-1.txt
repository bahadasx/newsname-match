GERMANTOWN FAIR
llet of the Keason Horwemen Say
That It Wast Beat Held In
State This Year.
Germantown bad what Is said by
many people to bo the best fair that
has been held this season. The stock
exhibits were much better than at the
average county fair and probably the
best horse show held In the State at
any place. Some excellent beef cat
tle were shown. This is quite a Short
horn section and same good in
dividuals were on exhibition. The
mule and draft horse show was much
better than at Ewlng. This would
make It a better show of these
classes than any other with the pos
sible exocptlon of the mule show at
the Blue Grass Pair. The hog and
sheep show was better than hail been
seen there for years.
The management was well pleased
with the success of the fair and stated
that it was a financial success. The
largest crowds ever seen on the Ger
mantown fair grounds passed through
the gates every day and the live stocli
barns and hog pens were constantly
filled with farmers eager to learn
something about live stock. Many im
provements will be made on the
grounds and buildings before next
year and plana will be made to im
prove upon the fair in every way.
Many horsemen say that it was the
best horse show held In the State this
year. There were several stables
with only two or three horses, but
the principal stables showing were
Claude Thomas, Paris; Fagan Profil
ers, Prooksville; Charles Scott, Man
chester, O., with Bourbon Tucker and
a lot of his get; Berry A Gaines, Wal
ton, Ky.; John Hunter, Mlllersburg;
P. W. Dlmmltt, Mlllersburg; Power
& Beat, Paris; Ed Perkins and Mr.
Galbraith. Thomas, Power ft Best
and Charles Scott fought hard for
honors, but Thomas carried off most
of them. Out of sixteen shows he was
awarded fifteen blue ties. Ills good
mare. Sweetheart, and Grand Mon
arch, a much improved stallion, were
his best winners, getting Ave blues
each. Comrade and Masquerade each
were good winners. Sweetheart Is
one of the most consistent mares on
the circuit, winning In all classes,
and has not lost a grand champion
ship this year. She met her haruest
competition In the grand champion
ship ring for flve-gaitod saddle horses,
mare or gelding. There were ten en
tries and while she won eaaily, she
was forced to show what she had.
Edwin Thomas, who Is riding and
driving the horses for his father, did
not make a mistake and is improving
rapidly. He Is the youngest showman
on the circuit.
