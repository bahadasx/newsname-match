' (AworUiri Piw by r4rl WItoUm)
- WASHINGTON, D. O, Aufl.
" President Wilton's plan for breaking
the deadlock between capital and la-
. bor the railroad executives and ths
employee and preventing the strike
of 4C0.CCO men was discussed today at
-several offielaf conferences, while ths
. railroad presidents and1 brotherhood
representatives remaining In Wash
I ngton worked In committee to see If
agreement can be reached.
.' The president suggests that the
railroads put In effect the eight-hour
day plan, and that the brotherhoods
give the roads time to prepare for the
change so that It will necessitate as
littls trouble as possible.
Ths law he is understood to favor,
covering future controversies, Is pat
terned after, ths Canadian act creat
ing 'a commission to Inveetigste labor
- disputes snd prevent strikes and lock
outs meanwhile,- it being unlawful to
striks or to lock out employes while
the Investigation Is under way.
- Because of the developments In the
railroad situation, congressional lead
.credo not new hope for adjournment
tfJe "week. Theyfave settled" down to
stay as-Tdngar necessary .to enact
!e j Illation to meet the situation. a
If all ne;otlatlons fall and ths pres
ident goes tifors Congress on Tues-
Vday or Wednesday next with a special
message to propose action, he will re
veal the details of ail negotiations In
. which ths government has had a
ahsrs. This was stated today.
With 'the departure yesterday of
40 delegates who have represented
the four railroad brotherhoods In the
conference with President Wilson and !
executives of the big railroads, the!
. outlook for a peaceful settlement of
the transportation problems grew in
creastngly remote, v -:
"Tentative plans were discussed, by
the president and Senator John E.
Kern of Indiana, majority-leader in
the senste, for a joint session of Con
gress to hear the president, who
would ask for the passage of legisla
tion to prerent the strike.
t Before leaving for. their homes the
brotherhood representatives appoint
ed 24 of their number as a special
committee with full power to take
what action seems best to settle the
differences now existing between the
men and the railroad heads. Although
vested with. plenary power to act on
all minor matters, they are restricted
to the extent that no decision can be
reached except on the basis of an
eight-hour day without any reduction
la the present wage scale.
A number, of the brotherhoods' del
egates declared yesterday that It was
uselesl to make any further attempts
to ; settle the , differences peacefully.
It was even stated that a strike of
the men and a tie-up of all the great
trunk systems . was -. inevitable. One
of the delegates went so far as to
assert that the hour for ordering the
strike had been fixed. The strike or
der, he said, would be issued this
week, probably Friday or Saturday.
. President Wilson Is expect 1 to
have a conference with the railroad
executives today. Their answer to
his proposal to settle the trouble. It Is
said, has been completed and will be
placed In the president's hands lmme.
diately. It is asserted that the reply
will be a flat refusal to treat with the
men on the basis of granting the
eight-hour day. ; -, .
Arbitration Is Barred.
The- eight-hour day is made the ba
sis of all action on the part of the spe
cial committee who will remain to
meet any counter proposals made by
either the railroad executives or Pres
ident Wilson.' The men are determin
ed that no matter what turn affairs
may , take In the next 4$ hours they
will hold out for the eight-hour day
even If they are obliged to yield on
all other points.
In view of the fact that the railroad
executiveshave firmly set their faces
against granting the "men an eight
hour day the prospects for an ami
cable settlement1 seems impossible.
On this point the two sides are dead
locked. The railroad men will not ar
bitrate any of the other points Involv
ed until they are granted the eight
hour day, and the officials declare It
Is impossible to meet this demand
without the loss of millions of dollars.
In, fact at present there appears to be
ro common ground upon which the
ooposlng factions can meet for fur
ther discussion.; - . c : i

Albert F. Judd. former territorial
senator. In a letter recently written to
Supervisor Francis M. Hatch, strongly
urges greater powers of seir-govern-ment
for Honolulu. t
He declares in favor of a more cen
tralized and responsible municipal
government, reducing the number of
elective officers to the mayor, super
visors and auditor.
He uraes that the city have tne
right to fix the tax-rate, that the city
have much broader powers or con
demning private property for public
purposes, and that the officials
named by the people be given greater
authority otherwise.
In ' response. Supervisor Hatch
wrote a. brief note expressing himselt
as ; interested in Attorney Judd's
views, and adding that he hopes Judd
will include in -his schedule of reform
the repeal of the primary election
law. v '.V' '

Hon. F. M. Hatch, Kalakaua Ave.,
Honolulu. T. H.
My dear Mr. Hatch: Your attitude
of service to the public as Bhown
by your accepting a position on the
Board of Supervisors of the City, and
County of Honolulu, has caused much
favorable comment. I , venture .to
write you on the subject, of why the
leaders of Honolulu s commercial ana
ether .affairs, (excluding things po
litical) have not yet come , forward
In any numbers ready to serve the
city as public servants. These men
are free with their criticisms at all
times, especially those who ride in
automoulles over, our bumpy roads,
or those who have to bathe in Nuuanu
water and the criticism generally
ends up in a vigorous condemnation
of the personnel of the Board of
Supervisors." w
. I consider such criticism short
sighted and not comprehensive. ;
We have a municipal organization
which Is not asv efficient as the mem
bers of the Honolulu business com
munity would wish, but the fault is
largely that . of the people of Hono
lulu and not of the supervisors.
The history of the evolution of
local self-government In Hawaii from
a strong central government is ex
tremely interesting but this Is not

down Into the lower part of Serbia and Greek Macedonia, is shown in
the map below. Transylvania, which Rumania covets, is also shown,
as well as Bessarabia, held by Russia, and which Rumania has given
