"We repaired It, nnd then
my partner went hack into
the brush and slept from lO
o'clock in the morning until
4 o'clock in the afternoon.
"We were supposed to
turn in about three or four
leaks a day, and hy that time
It was too late lo '''"I any
more leaks.
" *\\ liiit'll we do." I says;
and he says, 'You leave It to
me.'
"Then he walked over to
a main and he says, 'Here's a
leak,' and he begun to dig
there. There wasn't any
leak, hut he says to me, 'You
get busy now and bring a
lot of water.'
"So I brought a lot of wa
ter, and threw it around the
hole so it looked like the
main had been leaking, and
then he filled up the hole
and we went back and turn
ed In the leak."
"Whut made your partner
no aleepy?" O'Donnell was
asked.
"Oil, lie was one of a gang
that bad worked seven and a
ball hours overtime the night
before when there wasn't any
work," the witness explained

The first part of the morning
■was taken up by testimony show

water department, and the misuse
of city automobiles and property,
while the latter part was given
over to a close examination of
Chief Clerk L. J. Kreger con
y cerning the discharge of C. P.
Fenton, a clerk, in the course of
which Kreger admitted that he
had never given Fenton formal
notice of the reason for his dis
charge, but said It was "up to the
civil service board to do that,"
while J. S- Ellsworth, clerk and
examiner of the board, called by
■ the city attorney later, declared
the. giving of such notice was the
duty of the department.
i.ate All the Time.
During this part of the proceed
ings, Commissioner Gronen sud
denly asked Kreger if one of his
employes, P. R. Keith, was not
chronically late in .the morning
and idle during business hours.
Kreger admitted that this was
the case.
• "Did you ever talk with Drake
about that?" asked Gronen.
"Yes " Kreger assented.
'.'What did he say?"
"He told me to talk with Keith
and tell him to mend his ways,
and to keep him If possible," said
—reger.
Kreger also testified that Keith
is still in the employ of the de
partment, and that if he had his
way he would have discharged
him a year and a half ago.
Many Testify.

It ii ■iiiiii in had declared war on
Austria Sunday. The kaiser In
tend*, to hand the Rumanian am
bassador his passports today.
The German federal council
will meet this afternoon and will
probably declare war on Rumania

ed war on all of the central pow
ers.
Rumania acted following a
meeting of the crown council and

Rumania's army consists of
600,000 men.
War will mean that the Bulgar
ians must leave Greece to protect
the northern border against a
Rumania invasion.
Delayed press dispatches re
ported that Gen. Averescu, former
war minister, probably would be
made commander of the Ruman
ian army.
Rumania's declaration makes a

Greek influence. The Venlzelos
party Is holding great demonstra
tions, demanding war.

VETOES
RAID ON
FOREST
By Gilson Gardner.
WASHINGTON, D- C, Aug. 28.
—President Wilson's veto of the
bill which proposed to allow cities
and townships to buy public
I lands, Including forest lands in
their vicinity, for parks, ceme
teries and sewerage purposes de
feats a subtle effort by the anti
conservation forceß to begin the
, destruction of the national for
ests by piecemeal methods.
The veto message makes It
clear that the president is stand
ing firmly behind the principle of
conservation.
In returning the bill to con
gress he said that he did not be
lieve the national forests should
be utilized in any such way.
Served No Good End.
The most serious objection, the
message emphasizes, is that the
bill "subjects the national forests
to disposition under a general
grant."
The fact ia, of course, that any
city may co-operate with the for
est service now to secure neces
sary privileges on the national
forests for water supply, sewer
age, park or other purposes, but
the federal government retains
the right to decide whether such
proposed use is detrimental to the
primary use of the national forest
as such.
The federal control would be
absolutely removed, had this bill
become law.
Forecasts Other Vetoes.
For some years now, ever slnco
the Balllnger regime and the fall
ur at that time to destroy the
conservation policy, efforts have
been quietly going on in con
gress to slip through harmless
appearing legislation, with the
idea of destroying the national
forests by piecemeal.
The president's action in this
case forecasts his attitude on
such big steals as the proposed
Shields waterpower grab and the
Phelan oil land grab.
These pieces of legislation have
been postponed until next Decem
ber, and the interests bark of
them fear now that they will
never become law with the presi
dent lined up against them. j
