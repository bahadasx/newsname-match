LONDON, August 28. Rumania at last lias filtered the war on
the Hide of the ciitt'iite allicM." The official announcement to Berlin
that a state of war existed between Kiniiaiiia and Austria-Hungary
was proclaimed at Bucharest on Sunday. The indication that the
Rumania move was a predetermined plan of the entente allies is
found in the fact that her declaration of war was made the same
day of Italy's declaration against Germany.

BERLIN, August 28. Although Italy's declaration of war was
absolutely unheralded, it failed to cause the slightest ripple of
excitement here. The announcement was published in extra Sunday

formal declaration will have little effect on existing conditions.

(By Aaaoelalrd Preaa.)
ATHENS, August 28. The landing of the first. Italian troops at
Chimara, a small .seaport of Albania, caused gloom throughout
Greece, as the people now see not only eastern Macedonia in the
hands of the Bulgars, but northern Epirus.in the hands of the
Italians.
The Rumanian legation was guarded by a heavy police detail,
and stones were thrown through the windows of tiie Italian embassy
yesterday, .
The editorials were written prior to the receipt of? information
regarding Rumania's declaration and also without; exception the
newspapers express the hope that Italy's action would not force
Rumania into the conflict. This is the 27th declaration. Says
the Tageblatt: This plainly -could be expected when the present
cabinet of Premier Boselli was formed and Walter Runciman, presi
dent of the British Board of Trade visited Italy, then one knew with
certainty that Italy was irrerievably dependent on the allies and
could no longer act except as ordered. ,

looking to breaking the deadlock in
the situation of the threatened strike
on the railways of the country in

An eight hour law for railways,
effective sufficiently in the future to
permit tbe railways to prepare.
A law patterned after tbe Canadian
act which creates a commission of
investigation that prevents lockouts
and strikes, while industrial disputes
are investigated.
This plan was discussed by the
president and party leaders in Con
gress as the basis for the next step
after the railroad managers formally
announce their refusal to accept the
president's plan previously proposed.
While the president has not finally
given up hope of bringing out an
agreement through direct negotia
tions, he is going forward with prep
arations for taking the legislation
plan before Congress.
Late this afternoon the president
reached the capltol and conferred
with the Democratic leaders of the
Senate.- The administration officials
said negotiations with the executives
had not been broken off, as considera
tion of the question was continued.
The president went to the capital
to discuss with the Democratic steer
ing .committee proposed legislation.
Senator Newlands appeared at the
capitol with tentative drafti of the
proposed laws and conferred with
Senator Cummins. Senators advised
of tbe legislation said they also In

not be any Increase of freight rate
until after tUa matter waa submitted
to the Interstate Commerce commis
sion corresponding to any increase
of pay determined upon. The bill

Commerce commission. All
