It was generally understood that
Rumania planned to enter the war
with Italy in May 1915, but the
severe defeat of* the Russians at
about that time made it seem prac
tically certain that a declaration of
war would be followed by an. inva
sion of Rumania by Austro-German
armies.
Rumania's formal entrance into the
war makes a total of fifteen nations
now engaged. It is possible Rumania's
decision may exert a tremendous in
fluence on Greece, where the Venl
lelos pro-war party held great demon
strations yesterday.
Though the allied censorship oh
Balkan news has been very strict for
several weeks, wireless advices from
Berlin indicated uneasiness in the
German capital over the i-rogress of
the diplomatic battle being waged at
Bucharest. It was plain that Germany
feared Rumania would decide to Join
the allies after Russia lad swept
through the Austrian crown land of
Bukowlna and while the Allies were
preparing for a great offensive in the
Balkans.
The immediate effect of 'in 5
Rumanian declaration, in all proba
bility, will be to cause the eariv
withdrawal of the Bulgarian forces
that invaded Greece to protect the
Bulgarian northern frontier against a
Rumanian Invasion. The Rumanians
presumably will form a junction with
the Russians operating in Bukowlna

Rumania's entrance into the war
places a thoroughly drilled and
equipped army of nearly 600,000 men
alongside the allies.
Of the actual fighting value of the
modern Rumanian army ncthing defi
note can yet be told as it has never
been put to the test. During the two
recent Balkan wars, Rumania, of all
the Balkan states', alone kept out of
the struggle.
The organisation, and equipment of
the Rumanian army has been praised
by many eStfert*." Rumania's military
service la obligatory on all able
bodied men between 21 and 46 years
years of age. This gives the coun
try 50,000 new. soldiers a year and
enables Rumania, out of a population
of 7(000,000, to muster an army of
over half a million. Although Ruma
nian youths liable for miliatry service
do not begin duty until they are
twenty-one years of age, as a xhatter
of fact they are at the disposal of
the minister of war after their nine
teenth year. From the time they are
nineteen until they are twenty-one,
they are obliged to participate in tar
get and gymnastic drills every Sun
day from April 1 to November 30.
During the first seven years of mili
tary service, the men belong to the
active army. They then pads to the
reserves/ where they serve for twelve
years, finally passing into the militia
for the remainder of their term of
service until they are forty-six years
of age. The militia is supposed to
be liable for service only in main
taining the internal order of the coun
try and in guarding the railroads
during war times. Thla organization
gives .Rumania a total of £50,000 first

REASON FOB THE MOVE
Germany Sent Land and Sea Forces
to Aid Austrian* Against Whom
Italians Were
Fighting.
[By John JL iHearley, United Press
Staff Ctorrespondent.]
IROMiE, Aug. 28.—Italy declared
war on Germany because Germany
sent both land and sea forces to the
aid of Austria, enabling her to con
centrate her maximum efforts against
Italy, said an official statement is
sued here today.
A similar statement was forwarded
to the German foreign office through
the Swiss government, setting forth
the reason for the declaration of
war yesterday.
Excepting the capture tof Gorltz, no
event of several months has so stir
red the Italian public as the news of
Italy's challenge to the kaiser. News
paper extras flashed the word to
the Sunday holiday crowds and an
enormous crowd quickly gathered in
Piazza donna.
A great procession formed and
paraded through'the principal streets,
shouting "down with Germany," and
"long live the allies," until midnight.
The declaration of war against Ger

possession of Austria and was the
home of the Austrian embassy. The
embassy documents were sent to the

WASHINGTON, Aug. 28.—President
Wilson today took up what may be
his last weapon against nation-wide
industrial paralyzation. He put con

situation.
The president's conference with the
railway presidents' committee of
eight, at which the "final" terms of
the railroads were to be presented In
written form, was deferred today
from 10 a. m. to 2:30 p. m.
Indicating the belief on the presi
dent's part that chances of averting
the threatened break between the
railways and the railway brother
hoods have grown Blender, the call on
congress'is said to be not only for
legislation to aid in preventing a
strike, but to hafidle fhe strike should
it occur. He was said to be ready to
appeal to congress for legislation
along the following lines:
Such as might aid in the preven
tion of a strike should all

After a final conference the presi
dent was informed that legislation
such as he had in mind could be put
through congress at this session.
The president then made an unpre
cedented night trip to the capltol
and discussed his plans w.'th Senator
Kern, democratic floor leader.
If speculation, doubt and uncertain
ties marked the general strike situ
ation Saturday, it may te said that
today's developments promised in
rapid order a clearing up of. the now
dangerous and perplexing situation.
The president was to see both sides
today. The railways expected to
ignore his eight hour proposal for
peace and stand ,p%t for arbitration.
The employes, unless they were pre
pared with some entirely unexpected
move, apparently were certain to
order a strike.
All manner of reports were current
today as to the president's next move.

the president would go before con

that would make a settlement of the
dispute possible without endangering
the country's welfare.

A New Proposal.
[By Robert J. Bender, United Pres#
Staff Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, Aug. 28.—Presi
dent Wilson today presented new
proposition to the railroads of the
country by which he hopes to avert
the threatened final break between
the roads and the railroad brother
hoods and the inevitable Industrial
crisis that would follow.
It was this new plan of the presi
dent's, it became known this after
noon that resulted in deferring tha
conference with the railway presi
dents' scheduled for 10 o'clock at the
white house. It was likely to defer
this conference again beyond the hour
2:30, the new time set, it was indi
cated. It has become apparent the
president did not intend to hear the
so-called final terms of the railway
heads, while he considered there was
a possibility of obtaining radical
changes In the terms.
If the present effort foils, the presi
dent will appeal to congress and ii
possible secure the passage of two
laws that will delay and possibly
avert the threatened strike, and pre
vent a recurrence of such a situation.
