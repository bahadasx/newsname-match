playing in the heavens Saturday night.
Whether the phenomenon was the au

It: t, At first they showed well
down on the northern and northeast

they were well to the south at the
zenith.
The phenomenon had all the ap

It was a beautiful sight and many
Watched it for a long time. It is
probable that the display was caused
by static electricity and was some form
of the aurora bore alia Northern

WASHINGTON, Aug. 28.
President Wilson has prepared
a new proposal to the rail
roads. He still demand the
eight hour day but is willing to
postpone putting the shorter
day into effect until the feder
al commission arranges all de
tails and reorganizes the rail
road business to conform to the
new plan. The commissions
work might delay the change
one year.
If negotiations fail Wilson
intends to ask congress to pass
a law similar to the Canadian
disputes act. It averts all
strikes or lockouts for one year
pending investigation. He will
also ask congress to pass a law
providing an eight hour day
for railway employes.
Wilson this afternoon made
arrangements to visit the capi
tal at four o'clock and confer
with members of the senate
steering committee. They will
thoroughly discuss all strike
developments.
Wilson made an unpre
cedented night trip to the capi
tal to confer with Kern. Noth
ing was done toward increasing
the federal power of keeping
trains running during the
strike. Wilson does not want
the government to seize the
railroads.
It is reported Wilson might
rppeal to the Brotherhoods
to postpone the strike until he
has time to rush through legis
lation making a settlement
possible without endangering
the country's welfare. Manv
congressmen privately favored
the quick passage of the gen
eral eight hour law, affecting
all employes, corporations,
railroads and other industries.
