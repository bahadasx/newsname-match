WORKING ON DESIGNS FOR
HUGE FIELD HOWITZERS
They are to Have a Range of Twelve
to Fifteen Miles.
Washington, Aug. 27. Army ordin
ance experts are at work on designs
for huge field howitzers, as large or
larger than the German 42 centimetre
guns which wrecked Belgian and
French forts early in the war. They
will be at least 16-inch calibre with
a range of 12 to 15 miles, hurling a
projectile weighing more than a ton
and carrying a huge amount of high
explosive.
In addition to placing several of
these mammoth weapons along the
coast line for mobile defense against
naval attack, army officials now are
considering the creation of a special
regiment, equipped with six of the
howitzers to work as a unit of the
mobile army. The : r- h! m confront
ing the designers in that regard is to
distribute the enormous weight, of the
gun and carriage in such a way that
it can be moved over any good road.

Washington, Aug. 27. Tentative
plans for a joint session of the sen
ate and house to hear President Wil
son ask for legislation to prevent the
threatened nation-wide railroad strike
were discussed by the president with
Senator Kern, the democratic leader,
tonight, when it seemed virtually cer
tain that a break between the rail
roads and their employes must fol
low final conferences at the White
House tomorrow. Possibilities of
legislation were talked over by the
president, -Senator Newlands, chair
man of the Interstate Commerce
Committee, and Secretary Lane dur
ing the day and tonight he made a
quiet trip to the senate office build
ing to find Senator Kern attending
a meeting of the finance committee.
Brotherhood Men Leave Washington.
Since last night the belief that ne.
gotiations between the railroad execu
tives and representatives of tne men
would end without an agreement has
been growing. This feeling was
strengthened today when the mem
bers of the brotherhood committee of
640, tired of their long wait, departed
for home after delegating their pow
ers to effect a settlement or call a
strike to a committee of 2t, instruct
ed under no circumstances to agree
to arbitration of the demand for an
eight hour day at the present rate of
pay for ten hours.
Congress May Deal With Situation.
Whether the plans considered by
President Wilson and his advisers at
the conference will be carried out de
pends upon tomorrow's developments,
but it is understood that if all efforts
fail to bring the employers and their
men togeder the president will go
before co tjr ess and ask that it deal
with the situation, even if that neces
sitates indefinitely prolonging the
present session.
Strike Within Next Ten Days.
Unless the railroad heads recede
from their demand for arbitration of
the eight, hour day proposal, one
brotherhood head said tonight, a
strike affecting about 400,000 men
will be called within the next ten
days.
Both Sides to Confer With President
Today.
Representatives of both the rail-waj-s
and the brotherhoods will con
fer with the president tomorrow. The
executives of the lines will present
the plan to which they agreed finally
yesterday. Its outstanding feature is
a demand for arbitration of wages
under the eight hour day or any day.
When they have departed, the broth
erhood heads, acting under instruc
tions received from the committee of
640 today, will go to the White House
and apprise President Wilson that
they cannot accept arbitration of this
feature of their demands and that in
general they stand on his proposal,
made a week ago, to concede the eight
hour principle and arbitrate the other
issues.
President May Aask for Delay.
What will follow no one attempts to
forecast accurately. There was a re
port tonight, however, that the .pres
ident might ask the men to postpone
action for a period in order that he
might seek legislation which would
force and provide for a settlement
without tieing up the country's trans
portation systems.
Railroad Managers Take Precautions.
Among the presidents and mana
gers here, the opinion prevailed that
the proposal of the men would not
be acceptable to them and there was
no . concealment of the feeling that if
President Wilson has no other sug
gestion to make, a strike is coming.
The proposal may be taken under
consideration if the president asks it,
but little hope Is entertained that the
view tonight will be changed. The
railroad executives already have for
mulated the most careful plans to
take care of the situation should a
strike ensue. They declare that a
strike cannot last long and that their
precautions will insure the running of
all necessary trains.

Naval War Game Just Completed
Demonstrated the Fact.
Newport, R. I., Aug. 27. "The re
sults of the war game just completed
by the United States navy proves that
given fairly favorable weather condi
tions, an attacking fleet has an excel
lent chance of being able to land
troops within twenty miles of New
York,-' Rear Admiral Austin M.
Knight declared tonight. "Nothing of
this sort would have been possible,"
he said, "if the defetding 'blue' army
han an effcient scouting force, which
was lacking In this particular prob
lem." Rear Admiral Knight, who was um
pire in the navy's most Important war
game, which ended yesterday in the
virtual atihllation. of the "blue" or
defending Jleet, arrived tonight on the
battleship Pennsylvania at the head of
the victorious 'red' fleet which repre
sented the invading enemy.
Throughout the week's manoeuvres,
he said, the weather was misty with
a visibility rarely exceeding three or
four miles. Conditions of this sort
are characteristic of the Atlantic
coast at- this time of the year and
should be reckoned with in future
plans of naval strategy, he said.
The "Red"' fleet will be joined here
tomorrow by the "Blue" fleet, which
was believed to have anchored off
Block Island. -
