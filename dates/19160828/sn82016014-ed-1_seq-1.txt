minister to Berlin today, according-to
an Exchange Telegraph dispatch from
The Hague.
Rumania's decision was reached at
a meeting of the crown council sum
moned by King Ferdinand last night.
It came at the end of -two years of
anxious waiting in which the Roman
ian diplomats watchd with the tens
est interest the military fortunes of
the allies. The Rumanian declaration
ir. expected to signal Greece's early
entrance into the war on the side of
the allies.
To Invade Transylvania First.
The Rumanian third army, al
ready mobilized within striking dis
tance of the Hungarian frontier is ex
pected to invade Transylvania before
the end of the week, striking west
ward against Besztercze. The Ru
manian general staff probably will
send every available man into the in
vasion of Hungary in an effort to con
quer the rich province of Transylvania,
long coveted by the Rumanians. At the
same time a strong force will be main
tained along the southern Rumanian
frontier to guard against attack by
the Bulgarians.
Rumania's decision is expected to be
followed shortly by the opening of a
great allied offensive in the Balkans
that will aim to squeeze the Bulgars
between two opposing forces, closing
the pathway the Germans cut thru
Serbia to Constantinople.
Great Diplomatic Victory.
The Rumanian entrance into the
war was the greatest diplomatic
achievement for the Allies since the
European struggle began. Dispatches
from The. Hague today declared that
Berlin received the news calmly tho
the German press blames Foreign Sec
retary Von Jagow and Under Foreign
Secretary Zimmerman for Germany's
diplomatic defeat.
The Berlin military authorities sta
tioned a guard around the Rumanian
legation but there were no hostile
demonstrations. A Berlin crowd vent,
ed its wrath against Italy for declar
ing war against Germany yesterday by
stoning the Italian embassy, until po
lice reserves arrived.
News of the allied diplomatic vic
tory at Bucharest was hailed with
the greatest enthusiasm in London.
Everywhere the view wae taken that
Rumania's entrance into the war
means the speedy elimination of both
Austria and Bulgaria from the con

Athens, Aug. 28. Bulgaria's con
tinued advance into Greek territory
and the occupation of Greek forts at
the port of Kavala has brought Greece
appreciably nearer to war. No new
j decision has been reached by the gov
ernment but King Constantine was to
; hold another conference with his min

papers are demanding an immediate

; Pro-ally demonstrations were held
thruout Greece yesterday, centering in
Athens, where ex-Premier Venizelos,
: leader of the Greek war party, ad
i dressed 50.000 cheering adherents.
1 Venizelos charged that King Con

; many. He urged that the king be
. asked to show the most benevolent
neutrality toward the allies, at the
same time preparing the army for pos
sible war.
Populace in Fight.
Kavala, Greece, Aug. 2 8. The effect
of the Bulgarian occupation of Dox
ato, the scene of alleged atrocities of
which the Greeks accused the Bulgars
in the last war Is prodigious. Kavala
is the theater of amazing scenes of dis
order. Thousands of refugees are pouring
into this port from the Hinterland and
crowding the steep, narrow streets un
til they are impassable. The streets
are littered with every kind of house
hold goods flung sway by the owners,
fleeing before the advancing Bul
garians as before the plague. These
goods were abandoned by the fugitives
upon their discovery that means of
escape from the city by sea transport
are inadequate.
Small boats dangerously overloaded
with women and children are rowing
aimlessly about the harbors, their oc
cupants seeking asylum aboard any
vessel regardless of its destination or
price of passage. Complete panic pre

Saves Child Plague victim Blonde
Most Susceptible to Disease.
Chicago. Aug. 28. The first blood
serum treatment to be tried in Chi
cago in the campaign to combat the
epidemic of infantile paralysis, appar
ently has saved the life of one victim.
The serum was injected Friday and
physicians said today recovery seems
certain. The supply of serum is said
to be very small and it is being used
only in acute cases.
Germs Choose Fair Haired Victims.
Chicago. Aug. 28. Fair haired,
light complexioned babies are more
susceptible to infantile paralysis than
those with dark skin and hair, accord
ing to Dr. Archibald L. Hoyne. a. mem
ber of the commission appointed to in-
I vestigate the plague In Chicago, and
attending physician at the Cooy county
hospital. His conclusions were reacn
ed after an exhaustive study of all
cases brought to the hospital. Of the
first thirty cases it was pointed out
today, only one of the babies waa
dark complexioned.
In an article in c well known medi
cal publication. Doctor Hoyne points
to the prevalence of the disease in
Norway and Sweden to back up his
convictions.
WOMEN ARE ACTIVE
Bliss Grimes of New York Here to
Direct State Organization Plans.
Kansas women will take an active
hand in the Hughes reception next
Friday and will also devote their ef
forts toward placing Kansas in the
national Republican column in No
vember. Plans for the national con
test were outlined at a meeting in the
National hotel when Miss Ann B.
Grimes of New York, directed the
formal organization of the "Hughes
1,000 club" in Kansas.
Organizations will be made in a
number of Kansas towns of the state
and state officers will be elected to
direct the campaign for women votes
in November. Mrs. J. S. West will be
in charge of the organization in To
peka. Other officers in Topeka are:
Mrs. Lucy B. Johnston, vice chairman;
Mrs. Anna Chaney, secretary; and
Mrs. A. M. Harvey, treasurer.
Miss Grimes stated today that the
movement for Hughes will seek to en
list women of both parties and will be
made as nearly nonpartisan as possi
ble. The organization will be national
in Its scope, with women's clubs in
every suffrage state.
KANSAS IS FOR HUGHES
Henry Allen Says G. O. P. Candidate
Will Carry State by 80,000.
Chicago, Aug. 28. Henry J. Allen
of Kansas, formerly a leader in the
Progressive party but who is now sup
porting Hughes and Fairbanks, was at
western Republican headquarters to-
, day and told Chairman Hert that he
j believed Kansas Republicans will
j elect their entire delegation to con
! gress this year and that Hughes ill
Scarry the state by 80,000 plurality.
! Mr. Allen is on his way to Maine to
campaign in that state for the Repub
lican ticket.
Personnel of Full State Ticket
Still In Doubt.
REPUBLICANS HAVE FIGHT
Leaders Serene and Happy Be
fore Topeka Meeting.
Conference Will Draw Hun
dreds of Kansans Here.
On the eve of the party councils,
black. threatening
overhunar Democratic camns this aft-
ernoon, while Republicans were pre
paring ror tomorrow's meeting with a
spirit of hone and fiht thnt hnn wt
been in evidence in six years. Organ
ization nlans for th rm
well as the personnel of the full state
ticket is this afternoon in doubt. On
the other hand, the Republicans are
riding smoothly with every detail of
Tuesday's program apparently worked
out.
Arrival of several leaders of both
parties today gave the first advance
intimation of Tuesday's councils and
state committee meetings. One and
possibly two places on the Democrat
state ticket are to be vacated. Bour
bon leadership is also in doubt. Old
scores may also be opened and all is
not well in Democrat circles.
Republican leaders were today se
rene, smiling and happy. Their cam
paign leadership is definitely outlined.
They are claiming the return of nearly
the solid Progressive vote to their
ranks. No troublesome planks have
been dragged before the platform
builders and the meeting will devote
Its attention to plans of adding new
sorrows to the Democrats.
So Issues in Kansas.
Fred B. Stanley of Wichita, Repub
lican national committeeman, came to
Topeka today. He was certain Kan
sas would roll up a new Republican
record. As for a platform, he waa
quite willing to ratify the national
platform and let it go at that. He de
clared there were no real issues in
Kansas and the Republicans did not
need to make a defensive fight to win.
The slate may be cleaned and Chaa.
Sessions of Topeka, secretarSSjfc$Jv-
ernor Capper, elected chairman of the
state committee. Sessions has; been
handling the work for two years and
all possible opposition may be with
drawn in advance of the state com
mittee meeting. i ...
W. H. Markham of Baldwin, came
to Topeka today and renewed activ
ities for committee secretaryship. So
far Markham has no opposition.
W. T. Morgan of Hutchinson, lieu
tenant governor and director of. pub
licity in the western district for the
Republican national committee will
come to Topeka late this afternoon.
He will attend the party council both
as a member and adviser. He is in
touch with national plans for Kansas
and will attend the council of party
leaders in the shaping of affairs for
this state.
The Primary Law.
No vital issues will be injected into
the state platforms, leaders declared.
Governor Capper stated today that he
had no big issue upon which, he will
insist when the platform builders
meet The governor anticipated a
permanent highway plank, policies for
the handling of public service receiv
erships, eor.vict labor and strengthen
ing of the mothers pension laws. But
that is about all. It is probable the
Republicans will demand no drastic
changes in the primary law.
That Is the program of the Republi
cans as outlined by leaders late this
afternoon. But affairs of the Dem
ocrats are not running sp smoothly.
One of the troubles of the Demo
crats is absence of a leader. Late this
afternoon there was no positive move
ment for any candidate for state chair
man. Henderson Martin f Marion
may be placed at the head of the
executive committee, but is not eligible
for state chairman. E. 13. Murphy,
who directed the 1914 battle, has de
clared he will not accept the job again
Walter Hamilton of Norton is em
phatic in a statement that he will not
take the place. So the Democrats
may spend a few hours tonight look
ing for a first class Moses. '
Jobs Go Begging.
The question of a Democrat state
secretary is also uncertain.. James M.
lewis of Kinsley, secretary two. years
ae-o, came to Topeka today. But
Lewis is busy with his Kinsley news
paper and won't come to Topeka dur
ing the campaign this year. And that
is' the situation regarding f-tate com
mittee organization.
But it isn't the only trouble before
the Democrats.
Dan F. Callahan of Kingman toda
withdrew as a candidate for state
treasurer. He was nominated in the
recent state wide primaries. Callahan
is a wealthy Kingman banker. The
tanking business is too active and
Bourbon politics too uncertain at pres
ent to lure Callahan into a fight
against Walter L. Payne, Republican
nominee. So Callahan will ask that
his name be withdrawn.
In the hotel lobbies this afternoon
waa also a rumor that J. V. Colville of
Wichita may withdraw from the ticket
as a candidate for state superintendent
of public instruction. Friends of Col
ville declared the Wichita man would
not make the race, especially If Miss
Lizzie E. Wooster of Salina become an
independent candidate.
There is also a prospect of some
of the troubles of two years ago when
the Democrats seek to get together on
campaign plans. The old Hodges-Thompson-Xeeley-Billard
troubles may
break loose in tho meetings Tuesday,
although leaders of both factions have
pledged themselves to work for har
mony. But the situation which faces
the Democrats with their council but
a few hours away, is not at all encouraging.
WHEAT TUM8LES
News Romania Into the TTar
Smashes Market.
Prices Thruout IT. S.
to 8 Cents.
Drop, 4
Chicago, Aug. 28. Rumania's dec
laration of war smashed the wheat
market. Opening prices today showed
a fall in some cases amounting to 5
cents a bushel. September delivery,
which closed Saturday at $1.51 start
ed today, at $1.48 to $1.48. Other
options also broke wildly.
General rushes to sell took place
which were increased by the growing
chances of a general railway strike
in the United States.
Before the descent of prices could be
checked, losses that reached to V
cents a bushel, were shown for the
principal trading month, December,
which sold as low as $1.45, as com
pared with $1.54 at Saturday's finish.
Heavy Drop at R. C.
Kansas City, Aug. 2 8. Rumania's
declaration of war also affected the
local market all options b:ing lower.
December opened at $1.41 Vz, which
was 6 cents below Saturday's clos
ing. Other options registered losses at
the opening. A rally later brought
December to $1.44. The apprehen
sion regarding the railroad strike was
said to have been noticeable, but the
war situation was said to have been
the potent factor.
Notwithstanding that the tremen
dous pressure to unload holdings car
ried away for a while all other con
sideration, the extraordinary break in
values proves too tempting for buyers
to resist and the market showed the
consequence in rallies of 3 to 3 cents
from the lowest level which had been
touched. The upturns, however, left
prices still 3 to 5 cents down as
compared with last week's final quo
tations. Bear traders generally took the
view that the action of Rumania was
likely to prove a big factor in forcing
a more speedy end of hostilities or
would at least tend to hurry the open
ing of the Dardanelles and so re
lease huge Russian shipments of
wheat.
Slump at Minneapolis.
Minneapolis. Aug. 28. Wheat

READY FOR STRIKE
Railroad Brotherhoods Hare
$15,000,000 in "War Chest."
Would Be Distributed Among
Men In Case of ?feed.
Washington, Aug.. 28. Fifteen mil
lion dollars bulges in the war chest of
the railroad brotherhoods. ,
The amount, about equally divided
among the four unions, is ready to
day for distribution among the men
should they need strike relief. It is
to be doled out in portions of $40 a
month among the' $400,000 men who
would be involved . in . a national rail
road tie-up. How, long it would last is
problematical, for.vrelief might start
with the opening 'bf the strike or
might be delayed until later.
As the brotherhood men view it,
their mighty war chest probably would
not be touched in ,the forthcoming
strike, for they oeiieve it would be so
brief that the men would not feel the
pinch of unemployment.
To Avoid Violence.
This great war fund has been gath
ered through weekly contributions
during a long space of time. The as
sessment is according to the members'
earnings but the total sum per year is
written in fixed thousands. One little
code word, wired from Washington to
every railroad center In the country is
sufficient to precipitate, the threaten
ed strike. The more than 600 brother
hood delegates, who - left, their posts
yesterday, carried wTth them instruc
tions for running .a-strike.
Trains on the line Trill be run to the
nearest Junction; fires will be banked
and engines oiled.- The engines and
the cars will be delivered to the com
panies in perfect condition and every
union man will then Quit the property
with orders to avoid violence or tres
pass. Only twenty-four of the biggest
brotherhood men remain here today.
According to their version they must
stand pat on the eight hour day with
ten hours pay. The feeling in the
men's quarters is that the strike is only
a few days off.

Chicago. Aug. 28. Extradition pro

Kansas City. Aug. 28. With the
calling to order this morning of the
executive committee of the national
council of administration, the fiftieth
national encampment of the Grand
Army of the Republic was ushered
Into official being. Immediately fol
lowing was the session of the com
mittee of credentials. Meetings of the
Women's Relief Corps and of the va
ried allied organization of the Q. A.
R., were scheduled thruout the day at
their headquarters at different hotela
Convention hall, where the meetings
of the encampment will be held was
in bedecked attire for the aged but
light spirited throng which flocked In
to register at the circle of booths al
lotted to the different army units.
Clerks were kept busy answering in
quiries where, "The boys from Ohio
were staying?" and "If so-and-so of
the Eleventh New York had arrived?"
Boy Scouts on the Job. .
Little knots of veterans formed and
unformed before the various head
quarters as each new arrival entered
and was greeted by comrades-at-arms.
Street decorations have been made
more varied and doubly effective by
the loan of several hundred signal
flags by the navy department. These
flags are strung on ropes and swung
across the streets high over head. Vet
erans continue arriving on every train.
Troops of boy scouts are doing val
iant service piloting their aged "com
rades" to the hotels while Kansas
City as a whole has felt a gentle touch
of sympathy for the heroes who saved
the nation and is seeing that no com
fort for them Is lacking.
' May Be Last Reunion.
Threats of a railway strike have
kept many of "Lincoln's Boys" from
attending the encampment. Adj. Gen.
John Adams of Cincinnati said, add
ing that failure of the railroads to
grant rates, and the unusually hot
summer in nearly every section of the
union, has also cut the attendance.
Here, however, the choicest weather
prevailed. The maximum tempera
ture yesterday was 68 degrees.
Indications multiply that this will
be the last national encampment. Sam
D. Brown, commander of the Depart
ment of Kentucky, proposes hereafter
that encampments not be held en
masse, but by delegates chosen from
each state, proportioned one delegate
to each 500 members, their expenses
to be paid by the encampment.
Proposes Delegate Encampment
Commander Brown said it was only
a vear or two until the majority will
cease attending, owing to increasing
infirmities, and that his plan "will put
us on a business basis as well as
patriotic." He feels sure 600 com
rades could do the convention work as
well as It is done now, and that the
others would be content to stay at
home.
Many Special Trains.
The New England special bearing
delegates from Maine, Massachusetts,
Vermont, New Hampshire. Rhode
Island and Connecticut was the first
in today. It had been preceded late
last night by one of the Ohio specials
and later today the New York conting
ent was expected to arrive. Hundreds
of the wearers of the army blue are
l.cre from Illinois, Minnesota, Indi
ana, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania,
altho the special trains from those
slates have not yet reached here.
Pat Coney a Candidate.
Coincident to the opening of the
arious departmental headquarters to
day campaigns were launched for sev
eral candidates who wish to succeed
Captain Elias R. Monfort of Cincin
nati as commander-in-chief of the
army. Four men whose candidacies
were announced are Wm. J. Patterson
of Pittsburgh, J. Payson Bradley of
Boston, Patrick H. Coney, inspector
general, of Topeka, Kansas, and Le
vant Dodge of Berea. Ky. The elec
tion will be held Friday but in prep

CONGRESS TO PASS NEW LAWS
Wilson Sharpens Last Weapoai
Government Control.
U. S. to Keep Trains Moving if
Strike Is Called.
Washington, Aug. 28. At 2:30
o'clock the subcommittee of eight exe
cutives composed of the Messrs. Hold
en, Ripley, Willard. Smith, Atterbury.
Harrison, Trumbull and Lovett went
to the White House to confer with
President Wilson. It was not then
certain that they would present the
formal reply to his plan they had pre
pared. The committee of eight conferred
with President Wilson an hour and af
terward Hale Holden as spokesman,
said that a statement would be given
out by the executives inside of an
hour but that it would not be a final
statement.
Mr. Holden indicated that the plan
of the executives to present to the
president a written statement prac
tically turning down his plan had
been changed. Mr. Holden refused to
state whether the executives planned
to see the president again or to indi
cate their plans in any way.
Washington. Aug. 28. President
Wilson today presented a new proposal
to the railroads of the country by
which he hopes to avert the threat
ened final break between the roads
and the railroad brotherhoods, and
the inevitable industrial crisis thai
would follow.
It was this new plan of the presi
dent's it became known th's afternoon
that resulted In deferring the confer
ence with the railway president,
scheduled for 10 o'clock at the White
House. It was likely to defer this
conference aain beyond he hour of
:S0, the new time let. ft1 was Indi
cated. It has become apparent the
president did not intend to hear the
so-called final terms of the railway
heads, while he considered there wss
a possibility of obtaining radical
changes in the terms. If the present
effort fails, the president will appeal
to congress, and if possible secure the
passage of two laws that will delay
and possibly avert the threatened
strike and prevent a recurrence of
such a situation.
Won't Give rp 8-Hour Fight.
The president still stands pat on his
demand for concession by the rail
ways of the principle of the eight hour
day. He is willing, however, that suf
ficient time should elapse before it
is put into effect to enable a commis
sion of. five men to investigate and
vork out all the details recording the
application of the shorter hour day
to railroad operation a year if nee
essary. From the first the . president has
been insistent on the eight hour day,
but the proposition communicated to
the railroad executives today promises
them all the time necessary to allow a
thoro Investigation of the short day's
operation. The president has ben
willing and In this it is learned to
day he has been supported by the rail
way employes to let all details of tha
dispute with the exception of tha
eight hour day, be left to arbitration.
Thus far, however, the roads have not
accepted this, or any other of a scora
of suggestions submitted !o them.
Rail Heads Won't Yield.
Thus It appears probable according
to those In immediate touch with tha
negotiations that the railroads will not
yield to today's Suggestion.' The presi
dent has determined, if negotiations
fail, to recommend the passage by this
congress of the following measures:
A law similar to the Canadian dis
putes act, which averts all strikes and
lockouts for one year, pending the in
vestigation by a commission of all de
tails incident to the dispute.
An eight-hour law for railroad em
ployes probably an amendment to
the present sixteen-hour law with
features covering matters of overtime
and other collateral details.
It was learn d today that the pres
ident feels keenly disappointed that
tha two sides of the pending dispute
have been in the city more than two
weeks and within a few blocks of
each other, and that there have been
no conferences between the railroads
and the brotherhoods in an effort to
assist him in arriving at some satisfac
tory plan of settlement. The pres
ident, from the first, expressed a will
ingness even anxiety to pass on any
fair proposition either side might pre
sent to the other, in an effort to bring
them together, but that thus far no
such proposition has been made.
Pats Congress to Work.
