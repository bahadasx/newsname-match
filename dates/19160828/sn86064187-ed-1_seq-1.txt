Ru. barest ills), ah lies received Sun
dac s.ii.l tliat King Ferdinand of Ru
mama had convened a conference of
representatives of all the political
parties, former presidents of the legis
lative chambers, niinisteis and gov
ernment representatives, with the idea
of ascertaining the views of all sec
tions of public opinion.
Rumania is the fourteenth nation to
join in the war Her intervention
either on the side of the entente allies
or the cential powers has been awaited
with svniploms of concern hv both
since the beginning of the great con
fhct..
Opens Way ro Bulgaria. '
This is not due entirely to Rumania's
military strength, but also to the stra
tegic advantages of her geographical
position and the f.i.t that her rntrv
into the struggle opens
the Russian
armv a gateway thtoimr'Rumania to
attack thr Itulgarians from the north,
while the allied army having its base
Ht Saloniki attaiks them and their
( icrnian allies Iroin the south.
Nevertheless, Rumania's military
strength is by no means inconsiderable.
The country has a population of 0,
800,000 and her atniv has been esti
mated at 580 000 It often has been de
sciihed as one of the most thoroughly
equipped am1 disciplined armies in
T'urope, but recent infoimation from
Hucharest has thrown some doubt upon
its (piality. I.atelv it has been slated
that Rumanian otfnets are ill trained

The official Nojd Deutsche Allge
meine Zeitung sounds the keynote of
press comment, taking the position that
Italy's formal declaration of war will
have but little effect in view of exist
ing conditions.
All the editorials were written prior
to the receipt of information regarding
Rumania's declaration of war on Aus
tria -Hungary, and almost without ex
ceptioti the newspapers expressed th
hope that Italy's ,-ution would not force
Rumania into the conflict

to Rumania as a tevvan; if she woul-l
unite with the entente.
Rumania also covets llessarabia, tht
extreme southwestern province of Rus
sia, on the Itlack Sea. whic h was taken)
from her by the Merlin treaty of 1878,
Reports have stated that Russia also
has consented to restore llessarabia' at
a war prize with its population of 2.
000,1111, mostly Rumanians, and art
area of 2o.ml sipiare miles. This, with
I rans) Ivania. would give Rumania 4
total population approai liing IJ,000,0(X)
and. should all her aspirations be sat

that of F.nglaud. Scotland and Wales.

have stationed 100,000 nr more trcvnpt

factor for the consideration of the cen
