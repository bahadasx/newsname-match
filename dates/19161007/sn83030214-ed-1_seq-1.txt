Fleeing Foe.
London, Oct. fi.?The jaws of the
Allies' pincers in the Balkans are slow?
ly closing. Daily the sqeezing process
is drawing the Bulgars nearer defeat.
On the north and on the south the
Allied forees have increased their ad
vantages. Mackensen continues to fall
back before the powerful pressure of
the Bussians and Bumanians in the
Lobrudja. The Serbs have gained a
rvle in their advance on Monas?
tir. And once more the Britiah are
vignrously pressing the fight in Kastern
Macedonia,
Only in Transylvanla. where von
Falkenhayn is opposing them with over
whelmingly large forees, are the Bu?
manians on the defensive. Here the
Teutons pressed forward to-day at aev?
eral points on the tifty-mile front.
For the time being interest centres on
the late.at effort of Sarrail to drive a
wedge into the enemy's lines along the
Struma Biver.
Berlin Admita Retreat.
Berlin admits to night that Ihe Rj!
gar*. have evacuated "some of the moat
remote vlllages" on the east bank of
the stream, while the capturc of the
town of Ncvolyen Is claimed in three
Allied War Office reports. That the
Bulgar resistance is not what it has
been is indieated by the fact that the I
British were able to consolidate all
their newly won positions with little or ;
ii" opposition.
To the west the Serbs, now well over
the frontier along a front of some
eight miles, have pushed forward to
within seven miles of Monastir on the
i.outheast.
Horeover, the new advance of the
Serbs lerieasly imperila the Bulganan
line of communications.
In tha centre, along the Vardar.
where it has been supposed that. the
greateat effort of the Allies will be
lannehed, the situation la aaaiBeaaly
ealfljj. But with both flank* pnihed for
v.ard. n gigantic effort in the centre
may be expected soon. Success in this

Promises Allies Won't
Wage Post-Bellum
Trade War.
PLEDGES FAIR
DEAL TO U. S.
Minister Dcfends Blacklist
and Naval Blockade
by Britain.
London, Oct 6.-Lord Robert Cecll,
Minister of War Trade, to-day served
notice on Sweden directly, and all
other neutrala indirectly, that the Al?
lies will not consider mediation. nor
do they intend to relax in their black?
list regulation*. They intend to fight
to a finish, and will retain to them
selves the right to employ any means
that will weaken their foes.
In another statement, however, he
vchemently repudiated any Intention on
the part of the Allies to use the com?
mercial methods contemplated by the
Paris cconomic conferrees against
neutrals. He said wholly wrong con
clurrions had been drawn from the re?
ports of these conferences, and espe
cia'.ly with regard to those concluslons
attributing any attempt to exclude or
discriminate against the trade of the
United States with the Entente Allies
after the war.
-No country not entirely insane ,
would antagonize the I'nited Statca
for ita own sordid ends," he said.
"There are great probiems before u* i
after the war, Bnd we certainly would
not lose the advantage of Ameriean
capital and enterprise in dealing there
with. As regards the present, if any
British commercial association is mak?
ing unfair use of war trade conditions
we 5houId like to hear thereof."
Anstaers Swedlsh Premier.
Lord Robert'* first statement, warning
the vorld against offering mediation.
WBI made in answy to the recent eriti
cism by the Prime Minister of Sweden
of the blacklist and mail eensorship
policies of the Allies. He said Great
Britain was anxious to restore oldtime
trade relations with Sweden, and was '
willing to open negotiations looking to
that end, but Sweden must come into
taa conference prepared to do business
and to recognize the right of the Al
lits to prevent trading with the Cen
tral Powers.
In his comment nn trade relations
with America, he said:
"iiur relations with the New World
will always be of vast importanee to
us," Lord Robert said, "and they take
a leading place in our plans. ln an?
swer to the great calumny so often cir
eulated, and which we indignantly re
pudiate, I want to say that while we
are planning our measures for peaee
now, we pledge our honor that these
plans and measures, which we are
bound to take against neutral trader*
with our enemies under the laws 01
war, have been and will be kept entirely
aeperate.
Won't Fight Neutral Trade.
"They are worked out in different de
partmer.t*. They are wholly distinct.
We lhall never try, what we know
would be fatal to our intcrests. to u?e
aav of our belligerent measures toen
abie us to replace neutral by British
trade or itifll or impede the commer?
cial enterprir-e of neutral nations.
Lord Robert did not mention the
blacklist in this connection, but un
questionably he had it in mind.
"What one of the distriets devastated
dunnR the war would wish to lose the
opportunitv to take advantaj-e of Amer?
iean enterprise and capital?' he asked.
"Snppoee, for instance, no question of
friendship were involved. Then it re
solves itaelf into a question of plain
common sense busjness," he added.
Articles in Ameriean newspapers
which had been calied to his attention,
said Lord Robert, seemed to take the
around that If the Paris measures were
carried aat they would discriminate
airainn all non-Entente Allied trade.

Lloyd George Cautioned all
Humanitarians to Keep Out
This is what Great Britain thinks about any peaee proposal*
?uhich "?u.fll-meanincj" neutral* might make at this time. The
quntation i* from an interriexc given by David Lloyd George a
ueek ago:
Under the circumstancrs the British, now that the
fortunes of the game have turned a bit, are not disposed to
stop because of the squealing done bv the Germans, or for
the Germans by well-meaning. but misguided. sympathizers
and humanitarians. . . . Germany clccted to make it a
tinish fight with England. . . . Now we intend to see
that Germany has her way; the fight must be to a finish
?to a knockout. . . . The whole world. includ*'ng
neutrals of the highest purpose and humanitarians with the
best motives, must know that there can be no outside inter
ferenoe at this stage. Britain asked no intervention when
she was not prepared to fight. .She will tolerate none now
that she is prepared until Pmssian military despotism is
broken beyond repair. . . . Peaee now or at any time
before the final and complete elimination of this menacr is
unthinkable. No man and no nation with the slightest
undcrstanding of the temper of this citizen army of Britain a
, , will attempt to call a halt at this stage.

London ?Nation" Says U. S. Oaly
Can Stop Future VVars.
London, Oct. 6. "The Weekly Na?
tion" in a long article warmly defend
ing the attitudc of the I'nited States
during the war and regretting that her
"hints at mediation" have only met
with cold neglect says aetive interven
tion on tho aide of the Kntente Alliea
would have brought almost insolubla
problems for the United States.
The newspaper d*elares, however,
that the I'nited States has shown its
Bympathy with the Kntente Allies in
many ways, "especially in tolerance of
our innovations of sea law and treat?
ment of neutrals."
Agreeing that to dicUte peace would
bring no real settlement of the prob?
lems confronting humanity, the news?
paper contends that the entry of the
United States into a league of peace
is tha only means for insuring the bal?
ance of force on the side of the law
abiding nations.
"We ahall be guilty of a crime
against civilization," aaya the news?
paper, "if when the moment of settle?
ment arrives we refuse the aid of the
only power whieh can bring b healing
influence to the world."

BERNSTORFF
DENIES RUMOR
"Nota Word of Truth,"
German Envoy
Asserts.
i Frona lh? Tribune. B'jmu. J
Washington, Oct. 6. Uenial of the
j report that Ambassador Gerard was
bringing a German offer of peaee was
made to-night by Count von Bern
j storff, the German Ambassador. He
I said:
"It is a pure invention. There ia not
| a word cf truth in it."
The ambassador evidently had com
municated with his eovernment and re?
ceived a reply branding the story as
: tietion. He hinted that he knew where
the story came from and its purpose.
Officials of the German Embassy
charge that British sources inspired
the story to encourage the men in the
.trenches. This trick of the game also
| serves rinancial purposes, it waa inti
! mated.
Acting Secretary of State Polk
said emphatically to-day. that the de?
partment had merely granted Mr. Ge?
rard the customary aixty days' leave
at his own refuest, and that it waa
highly improbable that he had any of?
ficial mission of whieh the State De?
partment w-as not informed.
As soon as Mr. Gerard arrives he is
expected to report at the State Depart?
ment, and undoubtedly he will see the
President also, officials say. All the
questions in which his embassy has
been concerned will be discussed, in
cluding the probabilities of an early
peaee.
While the department does not be?
lieve Mr. Gerard would accept so im?
portant a mission without notifying
hia government, it is real.zed that
available means of communication be?
tween Washington and Berlin are very
hazardous where delieate subjects are
involved. The ambassador, it ia felt,
might be opecially relucUnt to at?
tempt to communieate with the depart?
ment regarding a matter as important
as a peaee proposal, with*the risk that
his niessages might fall into the hand*
of the Allies.
Officials at the department said to
day that only a specific request for
mediation by one of the belligerents
would bring about any effort by this
country to effect a European peaee.
In the ab'enec of Secretary Lansing,
who is ill at home, high official* of tr.e
department aaid no action would be
taken by this government unless actu
ally requested, even if a direct offer
were to come from one side. Doubt
was e\pressed whether a willingness |
to receive mediation would not have to
come from both sides before this coun?
try would act. It is felt both group*
of belliiTerenta have been so rigid in
their attitudo that any advance by a.
neutral would hava to be extremely
cautious.

BIG BANKER
STARTSSTORY;
STOCK FALL
Leading Financier
Claims Knowledge-?
Wall St. Startled.
ENVOY DUE TO SEE
WILSON TUESDAY
Will FoIIow President's
Meeting with Von
Bernslorif.
The president of one of Wall
Street's?and the nation's?strong
cst financial institutions summoned
eight or nino reporter friends to his
office yesterday afternoon.
"Gentlemen," he said, when they
had BB.scmbled, "I have inforrrration
of the gravest importance for you
and for your papers. I give it to you
freely, but with the condition that
my name is not connected with it in
any way."
Then the newspapor men took thia
statement from the banker:
"Although I am not at liberty to
name the sources of my information,
I know for a positive fact that Ger?
many has asked President Wilson to
act for peace. I am informed that
Ambassador Gerard is on his way to
this country from Berlin with defi
nite peace proposals from thfl
Kaiser."
Before the next edition of thfl
evening papers were off the presaea
the news had spread by grapevine
through fhe financial district. It
had been flashed to Washington, too,
and there a general inquiry was im?
mediately begun in diplomatic circlea
to get at the sourre and determine
thc reliability of the banker's infor?
mation.
Wall Street Priees Fall.
Wall Street reacted without waiting
for eorroboration. Trices that had
stood tirm under the effect of lesa re
sponsible peace reports showed a ahani
decline in the last hour of trading, aa
the first flurry settled into atcady and
heavy aelling.
Although it etands contradicted in
the most positive terms by the German
Embassv. there were few who classed
the banker's information with the wild
eat rumors of the last month*, whieh
have started nowhere Bnd end*d, when
spent, in the same place. The sland
ing and responsibility of the agent
through whom it waa transmitted to
the public was auch that Count von
Bernstorff, the German Ambassador,
pcrsonally made denial.
James W. Gerard. American Ambaa
aador to Herlin. is not expected to
reach New York until Tuesday. He la
aboard the ateemship Erederik VIII, of
the Seandinavian-American Line, in
midocean. He aailed for home Satur
oay, as was understood then and aa
waa insisted yesterday bv the State De?
partment, for the purpose of apendinf
a vaeation as far as possible from tha
eares of his embassy.
Will See President.
He will have a conference with Pres?
ident Wilson, who will have returned to
.Shadow Lawn before he landa. Admlt
ting this, and explaining that such ?
conference would naturallv h* an inasB*'
dent of his visit, Acting Secr*tary Polk,
in charge of the State Departm*nt dur?
ing the illness of Secretary Lansing,
expressed the opinion It was "highly
improbable" the ambassador would
have any such measage for the Preai
dent as indicated.
If Ambassador Gerard landa so early
Tuesday that he is able to get to
Shadow Lawn before nightfall, his viait
to the President will eome directly on
the heela of one by the German Ambes
sador. Count von BernstorlT, it i*
known, haa an engagement with Mr.
Wilson for Monday afternoon. when he
is expected to present an autograph l?t
ter from the Kaiser in answer to tha
President's personal appeal for the co?
operation of European rulers in relief
work for the Poles.
Wall Street's conjeeturlng and de
ductions invariably took into aceount
the warning whieh David Lloyd George
isaued a week ago to "well meaningbat
miaguided" peacemakers. In an inter?
view with an American nevrspaper man
Lloyd George said that Great Britain
asked no intervention when ahe was
not prepared to fight and would tol
erate none now, with her organization
complete and her entire atrength in th?
field.
Banker Ib Pro-Ally.
One BUggestion wbb that Lloyd
George'a delineBtion of the Britiah atti
tude toward peace might have been in
apired by foreknowledge of a German
plan to aend Ambaaaador Gerard homfl
with an olive braneh. Another waa
that tha new peace talk had been
started in an effort to leasen popular
reaponse to the new loans whieh thfl
Allies are soon to attempt to float ia
the I'nited States. But against thia ia
the known fact that the banker ia
question is in fairly cloae touch with
J. P. Morgan and himaelf an out-and
out pro-AUv.
