AT SUGG
At the Sugg theater, on Monday,
Oct. 9, there will be presented the
-:reat Selig play, "The Ne'er -Do-Well,"
written by Rex Beach.
In many respects critics assert that
that "The Ne'er-do-Well" is even great

Spoilers," also written by Rex Beach
and reelased by the Selig company.
Colin Campbell directed "The Spoil

Kathlyn Williams, who achieved such
emotional heights in "The Spoilers,"
even surpassed the record made there
as Mrs. Stephen Cortlandt in "The
Ne'er-do-Well."
Wheeler Oakman plays tho title
role and the drama filmed in Panama,
the locale of Rex Beach's story,
abounds in plot, counter-plot, hand-to-hand
battles, and strong love interest.
Beautiful scenic effects are plenti

RECEPTION
TO HARVEY
After Meeting Enthusiastic Thousands
During Day, Ozark Trailer Finds
Frigid Weather Here
EXPRESSES KEEN
DISAPPOINTMENT
Public Spirit Apparently Lacking, He Says;
Makes Talk Explaining Mission;
Leaves for Lawton
"This has been a wonderful day to
us and we have gone through all the
degrees of temperature." said Col. W
H. Harvey, president of the Ozark
Trail association, in opening his talk
at the city hall last night. "At Hobart
Mangum and other towns we found it
over 100 degrees in the shade and
here we find zero weather. At Man
gum we found all the stores closed,
with 1500 school children, the band
and a host of citizens out to welcome
us. At Hobart the mayor and 300
autos came out to meet us, there were
1700 school children in lino and four
bands. At Goteho, Mountain View
and Carnegie it was the same way,
but after we left Carnegie tho atmos
phere began to grow chilly. During
the day we have had as many as 2,000
people In our audiences and to reach
Chickasha and find public spirit ap
parently dead is indeed a disappoint
ment. There must be a reason for
this because I have been taught that
all Okluhomans are public spirited."
Col. Harvey, with Floyd Thompson
of Oklahoma City. President Hearn, of
Mangum, of the Ozark Trail associa
tion of southwestern Oklahoma, Sec
retary Tolbert of Hobart and Secre
tary Singleton of the Mangum Com
mercial club, had traveled from Wel
lington, Texas, near the state line, to
Chickasha during the day. John Pugh
joined them at Anadarko, and a party
of Lawton men, headed by Frank
Rush, superintendent of tho govern
ment game reserve, came here to meet
them and conduct them to Lawton
this morning. All told there were
fewer than two dozen Chickasha men
at the meetin".
ra'. liarvey discussed the Ozark
Trail at length, one of the interesting
revelations of his talk being that good
hard-surfaced roads can be constructed
of sand and clay at a cost varying
from $200 to $500 per mile, depending
upon the availability of material. He
told in detail how many miles of such
roads had been built, declaring that
they were superior In some respects
to rock roads. "You don't need to
issue any bonds," said he. "If roads
are really wanted the people will build
them but you must want them enough
to be willing to go to work."
Various members of the Harvey par
ty spoke, asking for the co-operation
of Chickasha in the Ozark Trail en
terprise. Bert Barefoot spoke briefly,
expressing humiliation that Chiekasha
people had not turned out at the meet
ing and Alger Melton also expressed
regret that more were not present,
both urging the necessity of action
upon the part of Chrckasha in pushing
the movement for better highways.
Col. Harvey, after going over the
southern route of the Ozark trail, will
return to Chickasha, arriving at 8
o'clock Tuesday and leaving shortly
afterwards for Oklahoma City. Dur
ing his talk last night he epoko in part
as follows:
Col. Harvey's Talk.
"The Ozark Trails were designed as
a system of roads connecting the four
states of Arkansas. Kansas, Missouri
and Oklahoma, and now include about
1.000 miles of marked road. Its copy
righted mark is formed by a white col
lar around telephone or telegraph
poles, trees, fence posts or other ob
jects, with a green border above and
below the letters 'O. T." in green on
the white field. Often in the form of
a goose egg, it appears on rocks or
large trees.
"The marks appear so frequent that
the traveler readily follows them with
east of mind and comfort. Tho asso
ciation had its birtli five years ago at
Monte Nc. Ark., a picturesque resort
in the Ozark mountains, and the name
of Ozark Trails was given to tho un
dertaking. Since that time It haB
routed and marked many roads In tho
four states, and Ozark Trails conven
tions h;"" been held at Neosho, Mo.,

"", Ocean to Ocean Road.
"As it became fully known the peo
ple everywhere realized tho great im
portance of the proposed road from
St. Louis to Texas or New Mexico, us
it would be a part of a trans-continent
al road. The present trans-continental
traffics N over the Santa Fe trail,
via St. L.OU,:; and Kansas City and by
the Lincoln Highway, Chicago and
Omaha. Wltli the Ozark trail complet
ed from St. Louis to a point in -New
Mexico or to a connection with the
Toxas road to San Diego, a new trans
continental route will have been es
tablished, shorter and more attractive
to the traveler than either of the other
two routes.
The picturesque' scenery of the
Ozark mountains, tho biggest fcinc

est oil field in tho world will bo on

Santa Fe trail for half the year is
eraging about. 300 cars per day. It is
safe to say that when our line is com
pleted, its shorter distance and many
attractions will make It the popular
route; and with the rapid increase in
tho number of machines coming into
use, our read will flood the southwest
with tourists, home-seekers and in
vestors, leaving, annually, hundreds of
thousands of dollars in our midst.
"The eastern end of our road, from
the Juplin zinc fields to St. Louis now
being assured with the road practical
ly completed, we next turn our atten
tion to the western end.
"Active road making, more or less,
is now in progress on many road3 that
seek to have our main east and west
ine routed their way, a friendly com
petition that is making thousands of
miles of good road.
Convention at Oklahoma City.
Following the policy of the associa
tion to hasten the construction of its
main east and west line, the Spring
field convention adjourned to meet in
Oklahoma City, and the date is now
fixed for Tuesday, November 21. The
convention will assemble In that city s
convention hall, seating about 4,000
people and will be attended by dele
gates from Missouri, Arkansas, Kan
sas, Oklahoma, Texas and New Mex
ico. Our conventions are of great
practical value, teaching ways and
means, how to promote and the econ
omy of construction. In this latter re
spect we are of inestimable value to
road making in the southwest, causini;
the money available to do more work
and better work.
"The Ozark Trail association is well
organized, has a legion of supporters
and friends and when assembled in
convention presents a most practical
and interesting exhibition of road de
velopment. Three thousand delegates
attended our Springfield convention
and eigh brass bands accompanied
that many delegations.
Method of Construction.
"We shall expect for our main rosd
east and west better construction than
we would expect for our laterals. It
will be a road of national importance,
reflet ting, if built right, great credit;
to tho states through which it passes.!
We cannot afford to skimp it.
"The right-of-way should be. umple
to tako cato of all difficulties. Tho
width of the grade, including ditches,
should not bo less than 34 feet. On a
forty-foot right of way this would
leave three feet for berm on each side.
Tho widtii of tho grade, however, will
vary according to circumstances. A
fill may require moro and a cut less.
"Drainage is most important and
sufficient height should bo given to
tho roadbed to secure this. Erosion
and friction, in time wears down a
road bed, and if not sufficiently ele
vated to begin with it may, in time,
become so low as to prevent drainage.
Ditches out through the fields are of
ten necessary to carry the water away
from the road.
"As we shall Beck federal aid in the
futuro in the perfection and mainte
nance of our main line, I advise not
less than a 30 or CO-foot right of way.
A less width for shorter distances
would be accepted, pending the time
necessary to settle this matter.
"We shall expect all of our main
line to be above high water, and thus
be dependable at all times. Concrete
culverts only will answer.
"We do not wish to have any
grades more than 3 per cent, 5 feet in
100 feet, but if special difficulties ex
ist, this most necessary requirement
may be temporarily waived in some
cases.
"Wo want it hard surfaced. We rec
ommend mountain chats and creek
graced.' These usually have enough
clay to act as a binder, and make the
best common hard surf act road.
Crushed rock Is good, but in time it
becomes lumpy, with holes In it, mak
ing it necessary to finally put gravel
or chats on.
"Our minimum requirement will bo
a sand and clay road that costs from
$1'00 to $300 per, mile.
Organization.
"The best results will be obtained
where there is the best organization
;md honest endeavor. Tho source of
aid in constructing highways ere vol
untary contributions of labor and mon
ey;' and money appropriated by coun
ty and township authorities. Upon
theso we must rely to mako our link
in this great trans-coutinental road
And when this has been accomplished
it will create the necessary confidence
to get state and national aid. It is my
opinion that in the state of Oklahoma
there lives a citizenship that will take
state prido in a road Ulat ,3 to f,0J(1
av-jtho stata wiUl addiUonal citizens and
wealth, and, will see that this road is
oiled, thus making it dustless and less
affected by water. But it Is first up
to the people In the counties where
the road runs to make good."

France Sends Fiery Reply to Recent Sug

by Dutch Government
By United Press.
Washington, Oct. 7. Tho likelihood
of the American government acting as
a prominent factor to bring about
peace in Europe is dwindling day by
day, according to general expressions
of opinion in officiul circles hero. The
subject is again receiving diplomatic
consideration on the eve of the return
of Ambassador Gerard from Brlin.
Ambassador Bornstorff's visit to
President Wilson at Shadow Lawn
nfxt Monday and tho president's con
tinued utterances on the subject of
world peace aro also topics of discus
sion in this connection.
Two points are made by those who
believe that the United States will
mako no further movo toward ending
hostilities. Great Britain, through tho
Lloyd George interview, given to the
United Press, plainly raid "hands off."
Furthermore, the political situation In
tliis country Is such that any move in
this direction inaui by tho administra
tion would arouse partisan feeling and
havo a tendency to give tho Impres
sion that tho United States Is not
strictly neutral.
France Opposes Peace.

, The Hague, Sept. 17. (By mail.)
The Dutch government otily two
months ago sounded tho European bel
ligerents on tho prospects for peace,
the Unitod Press Is informed.
All of the warring nations except
France expressed a willingness to en
ter into an informal discussion of the
subject, it is said. The reply of
France was such a fiery refusal that
one official described the contents of
it as "almost an ultimatum."
Dutch officials have not even at
tempted to resume peace negotiations
but are now convinced that the end of
the war Is a long way off.

Hard Linc-3ucking and Two Accurately

(By Kilbourne.)
In an exciting and closely
football game at the ball park
played
y ester-
day afternoon, Chickasha High con
tested with Enid High.
The teams were about as evenly
matched as any two high school squads
could bo. ,
' At 3:110 o'clock the whistle shrieked
sud the game was on. Enid kicked off
and the runner was downed In Enid
territory. Nothing was made, howev
er, as tho locals could not get behind
the line.
The ball did not touch the line in
this quarter, nor the socond, nor the
third. But in the fourth that's where ,
we worked. This quarter was Just
well started when "signals" was cried
by the quarter, and that was the last
heard until Hill, after hard llne-plung-Ing,
was downed across the line. But
Goetting failed to kick floal, and
Chickasha was In tho leadr 6 to 0. '
Then the ball hub once more kicked
off. Tliis lime Enid, by hard lin-
i bucking and two accurately and Quick
ly made passes, got the pigskin across '
the line for a tie-up touchdown. Tho
kick failed, leaving thorn, tied, just a
short time later, the whistle" blew
again, and the game was ended, with
the ball near the middle of the fiold in
Chickaslia's possession.
The pass was used with effect by
both teams. Loyal support was giv
en by a willing and large crowd of
spectators. Fumbling was done to a
much smaller extent in yeterday's
game than in the game with Oklaho
