LONDON, Oct. 6. "We are anxious
to restore to its old footing, the ancient
friendship and commercial intercourse
between the twai countries," declared
Lord Robert Cecil, minister of war
trade, today in an interview with the
Associated Press correspondent In
which lie replied to the recent state
ment of Premier Hammerksjold of
Sweden.
To the assertion of the Swedish pre
mier that Great Uritain is arbitrarily
limiting the imports into Sweden, Lord
Roberts said ttiat Great Rritain always
has been and now is ready to enter into
fresh nct'otiations for a trade agree
ment with Sweden, in which case al
lowances would be made for all of
Sweden's requirements which, he ad
mitted, are greater now than Ik fore tlie

industries. The minister of war trade

tary aggression. We ask no favors
from neutrals. Rut we. do ask that
they should not hinder our belligerent

"The prime minister says that he is
in harmony with the American protest
acainst tlie blacklist, but I observe
that lie makes no allusion to his atti
tude concerning the American protest
acainst German submarine atrocities.
Tlie submarine policy is in one aspect
an outrage upon the commercial inter
ests of neutral nations. Hundreds of
neutral merchant vessels are now on
the bottom of the seas, thousands of
tons of cargo have been destroyed.
"Peaceful citizens of all countries
an:l of both seas have been foully
murdered at the bidding of German

GOESTDPIIT
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
NEW YORK, Oct. 6. The New York
Evening Post today publishes a tstory
saying that it has been learned from a
trustworthy source that Ambassador
James W. Gerard, now on his way back
from Germany, will lay before Presi
dent Wilson a request that the presi
dent use his tooil offices' in suing for
peace with the allies.
"Germany has definitely decided to
apply to President Wilson," the article
reads, "to use his good offices in suing
for peace with tlie allies. This was
Uarued today from sources in a posi
tion to have trustworthy information
on these matters.
"It i.s understood that Ambassador
James W. Gerard, who is on Lis way
over here, will lay the kaiser's request
before President Wilson within a
week. It is a fact, however positively
it may have been denied officially, that
the possibility of President Wilson
acting as mediator has-been discussed
by German officials with Ambassador
Gerard. It is therefore by no means
surprising that tlie reports now take
definite shape in connection with Mr.
Gerard's trip to this country."
Ambassador Gerard is on board the
steamer Frederick V1IL due in New
York about Tuesday next.
News to State Department
WASHINGTON, Oct. G. Ranking of
ficials of tho state department said
today they had no information to indi
cate that Ambassador Gerard is bring
ing home a request from Germany that
the l'nited States intercede to end the
European war, and were not inclined
to believe the story. Count von Bern
storff, the German ambassador, de
clared he knew positively that it was
untrue.
While the department does not be
lieve Mr. Gerard would accept so im
portant a mission without notifying his
government, it is realized that means of
communication between Washington
and Merlin are very hazardous where
delicate subjects are involved. The
ambassador, it is felt, might be es
pecially reluctant to attempt to com
municate with the department regard
ing a matter so important as a peace
proposal, with the risk that his mes
sages might fall into the hands of the
allies.
Officials at the department today said
that only a specific request for media
tion by one of the belligerents would
bring about any effort by this country
to effect a European peace. In the ab
sence of Secretary Lansing, who is ill
at home, high officials of the depart
ment said even if a direct offer were
to come from one side, doubt was ex
pressed whether a willingness to re
ceive mediation would not have to come
from both sides before this country
would act. It is felt that both groups
of belligerents have been ) rigid in
their attitude that any advance by a
neutral would have to be extremely
cautious.

(Special to The Republican)
XRW YORK. Oct. 6. Carefully pre
pared plans for the national democratic
executive committee to extort a cam
paign fund of several millions from
federal officeholders in violation of the
spirit of the criminal code and of the
civil service act were disclosed ut re
publican national headquarters today.
The plans purpose the raising of tho
huge fund for the re-election of Pres'
dent Wilson.
The framers of the plan are perfectly
aware of the fact that they are skating
on very thin ice and have tried to di
rect the procedure of their subor
dinates so as to enable them to enact
a substantial violation of the law with
out being caught. The men who are
endeavoiing to ;.ut the plans in opera
tion boldly confess to the subordinates
upon whom they rely for the actual
strong arm work, that they are delib
erately seeking to evade the stautory
provisions to which, in public and for
purposes of campaign argument onlv,
they make such profuse profession of
devotion.
The first drive of cash collectors for
the democratic committee is aimed at
postmasters, but it is specifically set
forth that all other federal appointees
as well are expected to contribute to
the Wilson campaign fund. The amount
of the levy upon them is ten per cent
of one year's salary.
The postoffice appropriation bill, ap
proved by President Wilson Julv L'sth.
last, carries an item "for compensation
to postmasters, $31,000,000,0u0. " If tlie
democratic bagmen are only reasonbly
successful in holding up postmaster
they can expect to accumulate a fund
of many hundreds of thousands of
dollars, if not millions, from the post
masters alone, and this takes no ac
count of the many thousands of feder
al appointees whom these plans of the
democratic campaign committee mak
specifically subject to the visit of tho
bagman.
The democratic framers of then
plans for extorting Wilson campaign
funds from federal officeholders under
stand exactly the very delicate legal
situation of their scheme. Thev- are
careful to set forth in the instructions
to the strongarm squad the fact that
'of course this ,s not compulsory"
obvujusly meaning that it is not legally
compulsory but they proceed to state
that they are informed that there is to
be a permanent organization "of our
force throughout the country." This
permanent organization is to keep tab
on the federal officeholders. A record
i.s to be made "of the loyalty" of those
appointees who contribute, and of the
"disloyalty" of those federal office
holders who decline to contribute to
the Wilson campaign fund. Of course
there is no compulsion about a p-o-ceeding
like this. This merely noti
fies federal officeholders on the au
thority of the national democratic ex
ecutive committee, that if thev do not
"contribute" ten per cent of a year's
salary to the Wilson campaign" fund
they will be marked down by tho Wil
son permanent organization as dis
Ietyal. The instructions to the strong arm
squad go aiiead to point out that it is
a violation of the civil service law to
write a letter to a postmaster demand
ing money for campaign purposes or
to call upon the postmaster in ti.e
postoffice and ask for a subscription
to the campaign fund. The strong
arm squad are directed, therefore, to
avoid writing to federal appointees or
calling upon them in their offices but
are advised to seek private appoint
ments with the federal officeholders;
to find them at their homes or to catch
them when they are temporarily off
the job. With this explanation of tiie
leual difficulties in their way. the
strong arm squad are admonished to
"proceed intelligently along these lines"
and to contrive in a legal way to solicit
the federal officeholders.
There are several sections of tho
federal statutes the spirit of which, if

trovcrsy, the heads of the two wrang
ling factions, O. I). Ellet of Marshall
town and A. U. Coates of Des Moines,
were on the special campaigning train
throughout the day. Kllet is tlie nom
inee for governor and he desired tho
endorsement of the national candidates.
He did not get it.
Coates was urging that E. T. Mere
dith, the democratic candidate, be op
enly endorsed by the national prohibi
tion candidates, but he failed to get
this done.
J. Frank Hanly and Ira Landrith,
the nominees for president and vice
president, maintained a non-committal
attitude throughout. Hanly attacked
liquor traffic as being responsible for
filling prisons, insane asylums and
correctional institutions.
"Of the 450,000 persons who are con
victed of crime every year," he de
clared, "nearly 3D0,0(O of them can
trace their crimes to that thing in
which the government is a close part
ner; out of 250,000 insane in our insti
tutions, 150,000 came there through the.
same cause; of the 50.000 feeble minded
produced yearly in this country, 35,000
of them are in that deplorable state as
a direct result of liquor."
