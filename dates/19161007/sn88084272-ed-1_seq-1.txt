Boston Takes Lead in Third Inning and Is Tied in Fourth

of Outfields Is Arranged.
RAVES FIELD, Oct. 7. The Boston Americans tri
umphed over the Brooklyn Nationals in the first
game of the world's series here this afternoon bv a
score of 6 to 5. The Boston victory was threatened in the
last inning when Shore weakened and had to be taken from
the box. More than 40,000 persons saw the contest, which
was marked by brilliant fielding on the part of the victors
and strong defence on the part of the Brooklyns. Mar
quard started in the box for Brooklyn, but his defence com
pletely crumpled in the seventh inning when a couple of er
rors and a hit gave Boston three runs and a safe lead.

baseball, and plenty of opposition from

Teams Given Applaune.
The Brooklyns came on the field
while the Bostons were at batting
practice. They were given a big "hand"
by the crowd as manager Robinson led
his men to the visitors' bench. Jack
roombs and Ivan Olson, old American
leaguers, cam a In for quite a reception
from friends on the Boston club The
Brooklyns wore their grav traveling
uniforms with caps to match and black
and gray stockings. The Red Sor wore
white uniforms, white caps with red
and white stockings
While the batting practice of the
Bostons was on. manager Carrlgan and
iptain Jack Barry, often called the
r-d Sox strategy board, conferred
down at second base.
Rely On Interchangeable OntlleldM.
The identity of opposing pitchers was
a considerable factor in the composi
tion of the lineups of their teams, both
manager Robinson of Brooklyn and
Carrigan relying on interchangeable
outfields to bring out added strength.
Stengel, a weak batsman against left
handed pitchers, has no chance In a
Brooklyn lineup against Ruth or
Leonard. His place will be taken by
Johnston.

successor at centerfield for Boston.
