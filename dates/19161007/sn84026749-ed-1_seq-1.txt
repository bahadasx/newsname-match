DOUBTTHROWN
ON PEACE TALK
IN ALL CIRCLES
Washington Officialdom Agrees
With Wall Street in Discred
iting Likelihood.
GERARD'S MISSION IN DARK
Dispatches Tell of France's Un
relenting Attitude and Brit
ish Doggedne&s.
Much talk in high official cir
cles here of the possibility of an
early discussion of peace among
the belligerents of Europe has been
aroused by the reports that Am
bassador Gerard is the bearer of
proposals from the Kaiser to end
the war.
Well informed opinion among
diplomatists here agrees with that
of "big business' 'in Wall Street,
as evidenced by the recovery in
the New York market after yester
day's break, in doubting any like
hood of the United States at pres
ent becoming a prominent factor in
peace negotiations.
In support of this opinion it is
pointed out that Lloyd-George's
"hands-off" statement will be
given respectful heed as undoubt
edly representing Great Britain's
attitude. The close proximity of
election also will tend to defer any
atep whose consequence jcannot be
calculated in advance.
Dispatches from The Hague also
emphasize France's uncompromis
ing attitude and determination to
fight to the finish.
The dove of peace has ample
room to fly now, but nowhere to
roost, as one official put it.
FRANCE ONLY NATION
DENYING PEACE TALK
Met Dutch "Feeler" With A Fiery
Answer.
By CARL W. ACKERMAN.
United Press Staff Correspondent.
THE HAGUE, Sept. 17 (by mall).-The
Dutch government only two months ago
Bounded tho European belligerents on
th prospects of peace, the United Press
wai Informed today.
Every belligerent, except France, ex
pressed a willingness to enter an In
formal discussion. Franco's reply was
such a fiery refusal that one person who
learned Its contents described It as "al
most an ultimatum."
Dutch officials not only have not
resumed their attempt at peace nego
tiations, but they are now convinced
that the end of the war Is a long
way off.
The one positive Indication that
peace la Impossible at present Is the
wldo difference of opinion between
each of the opposing sides regarding
the situation In the ranks of the
other. During the past few days I
have been In Copenhagen, Berlin. The
Hague, and Rotterdam. Th first Im
pression obtained by a traveler Is the
wide chasm between tho contending
parties.
Copenhagen, which Is tremendously
anti-German, believes that Germany Is
about to fall to pieces: There aro re
ports of unrest, starvation, depression,
and lack of soldiers In Germany, The
people of Copenhagen and also residents
of The Hague, believe tho allied of
enw'Ye on the Somme, In Russia and
Oallcla and Hungary Is having great
success. They can't understand why
the much-talked-of "revolution" In Ger
many doesn't begin. No one pays any

istered considerable doubt regarding the
report that Ambassador Gerard la car
rying German peace proposals to Presi
dent Wilson, at the opening of the
stock exchange today when recoveries
from yesterday's break In prices were
general. ,
Many financial men looked upon tho
report as a market bear story, while
others ci edited It.

GIRllLflrlEAD
E
Police, However, Believe She
May Have Directed Fatal
Hold-up.
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 7. Millie dl
Marco, pretty twenty-year-old Italian
girl, was either the leader or the dupe
of the bandit gang that shot to death
Henry Rider and seriously wounded
A. J, Rider. Mrs. Elsie Smathers, and
John Rlgby, near Summit Ridge, N. J.,
day before yesterday.
This was the conclusion of detec
tives working on the case today, fol
lowing her statement that she knew
nothing of the Intentions of the gang
and was victimized.
The pollco frankly put little faith in
her claim. She declared Giuseppe
Russo, held as a murderer, Invited her
tn."takeCa-rlde for her, health" Jnthe
automobile which drove the bandits to
the sceno of the murder.
Millie, Russo, Frank Vessela, and
Frank Ladonne were all held without
ball here for extradition to New Jer
sey. The arrest of five more Italians, be
lieved Implicated, Is expected today.
Admits He Drore Car.
Vassella admits he drove the murder
car, but says he had no hand In the Job,
knew nothing 'of the purposes of the
trip, and simply rented the machine to
the men concerned for $15 a day. The
other two suspects adroit they were
near the scene of the crime.
Posses from Burlington, Camden, and
Atlantic counties have thrown lines
around the barrens and are guarding
every road. They believe the seven or
eight others concerned In the hold-up
and shooting had no opportunity to es
cape, and expect gradually to close In
on them.
Two suspects arrested at Camden
were released when they were able to
prove that they were at work at the
time the murder occurred.
Suffering From Shock.
A. J. Rider la In Jefferson Hospital
here, prostrated more from shock than
from hi wounds In the cheek and back.
His health has not been good fortome
months.
Mrs. Smathers also Is In Jefferson
Hospital, shot In the back and through
the leg. Her condition Is not serious.
The young widow, whose husband died
less than a month ago, smilingly depre
cated attempts today to make a heroine
of her.
Rlgby, who was shot seven times
when he stood up In the back of the
car and returned the Are of the bandits,
Is In a serious condition. He Is not a
chauffeur, as had been reported, but a
plumber, who had been talking with A,
J, Rider about a contract. He also la in
Jefferson Hospital.

Washington Railway and Elec
tric Co. to Appeal From
Overcrowding Order.
ATTACKS NEW REGULATIONS
Provisions Called "Imprac
ticable, Unreasonable, Un
certain, and Invalid."
The Washington Railway and Electric
Company todt served notice of Its In
tention to appeal to the courts unless
the Public Utilities Commission recon
siders Its recently promulgated rules In
regard to the regulation of overcrowd
ing on the street railways of the Dis
trict of Columbia.
In a "note of dissatisfaction" to the
commission, Clarence P. King, presi
dent of the company, characterizes the
new rules as "Impracticable, unreason
able, uncertain, vague. Indefinite, Incap
able of enforcement and Invalid."
Although It la understood that the
Capital Traction Company may take
similar action, nothing definite as to
this could be obtained today owing to
the absence from the city of President
George E. Hamilton and General Man
age Hanna.
Will Consider Request.
Col. Charles W Kutt. Engineer Com
missioner of the District, declared
after reading the communication
from Mr. King, that the commis
sion will consider the request of the
company for a reconsideration "in due
course," and determine Its course of ac
tion. Inasmuch as the new rules are to be
come effective under the order of the
commission on November 1. It Is as
sumed that the matter will come to a
head within the next few days.
The rules of the commission were Is
sued, It was explained, not to Improve
the street car service In the District as
a whole, at this time, but to standardise
it on the basis of what Is now the aver-'
age servicu maintained, and, lit that
way. to Improve tho service on lines
where it Is now bad.
What Rule Provides.
Under the new regulations the com
panies. In rush hours would be required
to have enough cars available so that
an average of seven square feet of
space would be allowed each strap
hanger: and. In non-rush hours, so that
every passenger would be able to get
a seat.
At the time the rules were Issued
last week ,the Commission admitted
Its Inability to devise any scheme
whereby passengers would be prevent
ed from crowding on cars or
carrying their maximum number, as
prescribed by the order, but explained
that, by requiring a sufficient number
of cars In the rush hours. It would
then be up to the public to decide
whether or not It would enjoy the ben
efits. In his communication to the Com
mission Mr. King contends that the
new rules are admittedly not based
on any proof of an existing lack of
service, and officials of the company
added today that they are prepared
where such proof Is offered to Improve
tho service complained of.
The letter to the Commission Is as
follows:
"This Is to give notlco that the Wash
ington Railway and Electric Company
Is dissatisfied with yourorder No. 183.

tratced Infantile Paralysis
From "Carrier."

Infantile parallels.
Dr. Hunt becamo III September i.
for some time he had been assisting
the Health Department in keeping un
der obrcrvatlon persons coming to tho
District from Infected communities.
Tho theory of physicians of the depart
ment Is that he contracted the disease
from an apparently well person, a "car
rier. His last visit to a patient actually suf
fering from the disease was made In
July. The length of time that elapsed
between that visit and the data of his
Illness, officials of the Health Depart
ment, say, moke It Improbable that
lie contracted the disease from that
source.
Dr. Hunt waa an expert In the ad
ministration of anesthetics. He waa
born In Lewlston, Me., and was thirty
nine years old.
In 1905 he was graduated from the
medical school of George Washington
University. He was formerly employed
In tho Census Office, and was at one
time private secretary to Senator Will
iam P. Krye, of Maine.
Dr. Hunt was married In June to Miss
Mario Scltz. He waa the first physician
In the District to contract the disease
since Its appearance In July.

Baker Calls Halt
Guard Recruiting
War Secretary, Dissatisfied With
Slow Progress, Orders
Stations Closed.
Dissatisfied with recruiting of national
guardsrpen, Secretary of War Baker to
day authorised commanding generals of
the army departments to discontinue
recruiting service at their discretion.
The decision was based on a recom
mendation by the general staff. Re
cruiting has been disappointing. Grant
difficulty has been met In trying to nil
up the national guard regiments at the
border or ready to leave for the border.
The deprtment had built an expensive
system o frecruitlng. with regular array
offlcsrs and mllltla officers co-operating.
The stations. It was admitted, have not
met expectations.
