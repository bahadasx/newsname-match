WHITE CROSS
Nurses Enter Vocational Field
That They Should Rapidly
Develop.
Will Serve Cause of "Womanhood
Whenever and Wherever
Required.
Develop System That Will Pro
vide JVgnlnst Sickness and
Old Age.'
'
FATHER DIETZIS DIRECTOR
'Catholic organization and social
work is for tho most part done out
of ctiarlty and gooL.wIll, and be
cause'of tho necessity oftentimes by
unskilled volunteer workers. There
Is no wish to minimize the good
works which havo'been accom
plished by such volunteers, yetin
the nature of things this workfls
likely to be more palliative than
remedial. Frequently workers vol
unteer their services only for brief
periods of time, or through lack of
responsibility, knowledge or leisure
become indifferent to duties as
signed them, or neglect them alto
gether, making social work more a
novelty than a profession. This
proves the need of tho paid social
worker. It is just as important
that a social worker receive a wage,
and one that will afford her a de
cent living, as It Is for those who
enter other professions and callings.
Tho White Gross nurses were or
ganized on the Feast of the Holy
Rosary in October, 1915, by eight
students of the American Academy
of Christian Democracy. Their ob
ject Is to furnish to tho Catholic
associations, leagues and federations
properly trained secretaries, fiejd
agents, press correspondents, lec
turers, parish visitors, social work
ers, practical nurses, etc. There is
an Increasing demand for associa
tion workers possessing qualifica
tions co-extensive with tho nature
of the many and varied Catholic
works. It is a vocational field that
has hardly been developed and
which awaits rapid expansion.
The White Cross nurses are not a
religious sisterhood and do not pro
pose to be, but religion is the
prime motlveof Jtlyjljwork, .The
'Bntd'adheatt'-cT'nioireligloud if
required, not the outward appear
ance; it is a special vocation to
works which, fqr various reasons,
the religious sisterhoods are unable
or willing to undertake. It Is not
so much within the plan of tho
White Cross nurses to initiate new
enterprises as to foster, under or
ganized auspices, existing good
works, and to extend if possible
their usefulness. They have the
vocation to put themselves humbly
at tho disposition of tho Catholic
cause of womanhood whenever and
wherever required.
It may seem strange to some that
the word "nurse" has been chosen.
Usually It suggests tho sick room
and the hospital. In a broader
sense, however, "nurse" Is defined
as meaning to nourish, to cherish,
to foster, to tako caro of, to man
age with care and economy, etc.
It is in the sense of this broader
definition that the "White Cross
nurses" have chosen for their own
no special field beyond the encour
agement of existing works, the rais
ing of tho standards of organized
efficiency and general co-ordination
of Catholic efforts In the light of a
basic Christian philosophy of so
ciety. A gift of 175 acres of land near
BlacK Mountain, N. C, has just
been made to tho Rev. Peter E.
DIetz for tho development of this
work. It is situated at the foot of
Mt. Mitchell, tho highest peak east
of tho Rockies. The Episcopalians,
Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists,
have developed great summer colon
ies here. The Y. M. C. A., Y. W.
C. A. and the, National Student's
Association own a thousand acres
of land with splendid buildings.
Here also a great music auditorium
Is being built. Into this develop
ment there will come a Catholic
feature through tho American Acad
emy of Christian Democracy. Black
Mountain is on the main 'line of the
Southern railway, sixteen miles from
Ashevllle, N, C, and can bo reached
without change of trains from Cin
cinnati or Washington.
A social service novitiate in these
surroundings, away from the dis
tractions of tho city, is the verr
best means of making "social serv
ice" not merely "technically effi
cient," but also "supernatural" in
its motive and ends. Tho idea of
a novitiate has an honored placo In
all great Catholic organized work.
Tho soul of reform Is the reform of
the soul. Ho who would uplift oth
ers must first uplift himself.
Young ladles from twenty to
thirty-five' years of age may, upon
application,' bo admitted to a
twelve weeks' course of social
study without any expense if they
will sign a contract to serve upon
satisfactory completion of the
course in whatever field is assigned
to tnem, as a voiumeer ior buc
months, room, board and laundry
being provided, and as a regular
White Cross nurse at a salary of
$40 per month for the period of one
voar. Students who do not wish to
sign a contract may elect to pay the
rofrnlnr nrsiflflmln fees.
rosular academic fees
There is also In process of devel
opment an insurance system for the
White Cross nurses that wm- pro-
vide against sickness and old age.

Republican Money and Im

REPUBLICANS LOCAL QUARREL
Many straw votes are being taken
throughout the country, and in
every Instance a steady drift to Wil
son Is being shown in the Presi
dential race. The Now York Her
ald, the Now York American, Cin
cinnati Enquirer and other leading
papers are publishing weekly a
census of straw votes taken In every
walk of life. In the New York
American canvass the vote taken In
Wall street showed a decided
preferenco for Hughes, and In the
Cafe Savarln, where bankers and
brokers gather, tho vote taken was
Hughes 387 to 77 for Wilson. The
vote taken in the Consolidated Stock
Exciiange brought the same result.
Tho brokers who aro busy gambling
In munitions voted for Hughes, but
tho employes, clerks, etc., voted for
Wilson. The canvass along the
water front of the West Side showed
that Wilson's strength Is found
among tho workers and a decided
contrast was found to that of the
high financiers and food trust lead
ers. Out of a total of 881 votes in
tho working district 765 were for
President Wilson. The samo result
was achieved In another way. In
the straw vote taken in tho Vander
bllt, Astor, St. Regis and other of
the fashionable hotels Hughes was
the favorite, but In the modern
priced hotels Wilson led his op
ponent easily.
The same old story applied In
tho amusement places. The audi
ences In the leading theaters and
opera houses showed a preference
for Hughes, the Wall street candi
date, but the popular priced thea
ters and moving picture houses
showed a decided preference for
Wjlspu Thq. above refers to the
canvass b"elh g Taken""'b"'" " the "N5w
York American. The New York
Herald Is making a poll of twenty
eight States, the majority of which
could be classed as doubtful, and In
every lnstanco tho reader is bound
to reach the same conclusion as In
tho above. In offices of trust com
panies, banks and brokers Hughes
Is the favorite, but out among the
people in tho stores, shops, factories,
etc., Wilson Is given the call, being
the favorite of tho men and women,
who admire him for his stand in
favor of the eight-hour law, as they
know that stand was not taken for
the benefit of the trainmen alone,
but will bo tho opening gun for a
universal eight-hour day for work
ers in all lines of trade or business.
It is a case of Hughes, the Wall
street and corporation candidate,
against the great common people,
and tho vote of the latter should
settle decisively next month as to
who should govern this country, the
few moneyed barons and child labor
employers or the workers and build
ers of the nation.
That the moneyed Interests aro
backing Hughes to the limit is
shown by the Republican activity in
Kentucky, National Committeeman
.Hort, the new Moses of the G. O.
P. In this State, seeing to It that
the boys had plenty of tho filthy
lucre, tho reports from Lexington,
Covington, Owensboro and all be
ing tho same, and that was why
tho Republicans " were spending
money like drunken sailors. Rlcht
here in Louisville the Searcy-Chilton
combination saw to It that every
precinct was well handled, and
strange to say bluffed the Ryans and
Conkllng faction into helping out,
the latter seeming to forget the
awful steal In the recent primary
in which they were tho victims. As
usual hero the majority of the Re
publican vote registered was the
negro vote, a big Increase being
shown la this vote, and verifies the
rumor that negroes were being im
ported into some of the Ohio Valley
States. Matt Chilton, one of tho
local bosses, went through the
Eighth and Ninth wards personally,
and in the negro districts he would
quory his captains as to whether
they were getting out "our niggers."
Another element at the polls was
the Junior Order boys, who have
not been prominent slnco tho
Buschemeyer-Axton election, when
they created a furore vith their lit
tle red badges. They are all now
whooping for Hughes, their prin
cipal grievance against Wilson being
tho fact that Joseph Tumulty, his
secretary, is a Catholic.
It is rumored that thero promises
to be a real row in local Republi
can circles, as thero aro stories of
an attempt being made to sacrifice
Owons for Congress and the other
Republican nominees, to concentrate
on tho election of Lucas as
Prosecutor In the Pollco Court, it
being said that with this office they
could hound Democrats in that
court next year. Some of the lead
ing Republicans openly say they
will vote for Swagar Sherley for
Congress, and this with tho attempt
of the machine Republicans to elect
Lucas only has made Owens' friends
very mad, a squall being expected
at any minute.
Democrats outnumbered Republi
cans by close to 10,000 in the regis
tration which ended Wednesday
night. The total registered vote in
the city was 51,067. Democrats
registered 28,280 voters, Republi
cans brought out 18,303 and inde
pendents numbered 4,314. These
figures give the Democrats a plur
ality of 9,907 voters over tho Re
publicans and a majority of 5,093
over all.
ATHLETICS.
President ' Seb O. Hubbuch this
week named the officers of Mackln
Council's athletic club for tho en
suing season, with Al. C. Spayd as
Chairman. Tho new Board of Di
rectors will conduct their affairs
Independent of the council, and it
Is believed they will surpass all
former records. When seen by the
reporter President Hubbuch said:
"Speaking of athletics, I want to
say that never before have I ex
perienced the enthusiasm that was
created at Mackln last winter and
this summer. I will assure you
that tho board that T have ap
pointed will institute something in
tho near future that will make the
athletic fan take notice They aro
very capable promoters and by
their able endeavor should make
Mackln the competing champion of
everything in athletics." After the
board was appointed Chairman Al.
C. Spayd assigned tho following to
each -branch of athletics: Al. C.
Spayd, track, boxing and wrestling;
John R. Barry, basketball;
Bernte Shleman, tennis; Eugene
Thompson, gymnasium; H. L.
Sheckler, baseball, and Bob
Morris, Secretary. Tho Chairman
of tho board is contemplating a
mammoth athletic carnival to bo

federation. It will .bo opened to
every club In the Falls Cities.

AGAINST DIVORCE.
It is said that tho Episcopalian
church Is considering steps by which
it will be made impossible for di
vorced persons to be married by any
clergymen of that denomination.
A commission of five Bishops and
an equal number of ministers and
laymen has recommended to the
general convention, which is to
meet In St. Louts, that the canon
law of the church be changed so as
even to exclude the innocent party
to a divorce action from being re
married. The reason given is tho

IRELAND
Movement to Conscript Unwill
ing Irish Into British Army
Spreading.
Largo Irish Population in Aus
tralia Extremely Opposed
to Enlisting.
Redmond nnd Devlin Will JLcad.
Against Enforced Military
Service.
WILL DRAG OUT UNARMED MEN
According to tho Irish Press
News Service advices from London,
Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester and
Sheffield show that the movement
to conscript the unwilling Irish into
tho British army has spread from
London to tho chief provincial cities
of England and that by November
it Is believed across the channel that
Ireland will bo compelled to accept
enforced military service. The prtf
vlnclal papers have taken up tho
cry started by the London press and
various coalition members of Parlla- '
ment do not hesitate to say that tho
time has come for the young men
of Ireland to join the English and
Scotch in offering up their lives for
tho preservation of tho empire In
Lancashire reprisals against tho
Irish are threatened after tho war
and already many Irish laborers
havo been driven out of English
fields and mobbed in towns.
The total British army is es
timated at 4,000,000, of which
3,000,000 are engaged on all fronts,
leaving 900,000 at home. Of this
iiOO.OOO fully two-thirds are being
drilled and made ready for service.
There are some 300,000 under arms
prepared to defend England from
attack, of which 45,000 aro held In
Ireland guarding that laland against
possible rebellion. Of the 3,000,000
sent to alk fronts there have been
approximately 1,800,000 casualties,
based on tho usual average officers'
losses. Army officers now In Dub
lin state that the British casualties,
chiefly on the Sonime, since July 1
have not been less than 500,000.
They claim that fully oO per cent,
of tho wounded arc returned to the
ranks, but those gains are partly
offset by the large number Invalided
home, not counted as casualties, and
th"e number of furloughs ' granted.
The army officers are grumbling
over tho vast number of 3,000,000
of men engaged In alleged munition
and transport and ship work at
home, claiming that at least 1,000,-
000 of these homo workers aro
slackers and are not necessary in
the shops, supply stores and ship
yards. The demand for the entry
of that class of workers into trench
warfare has caused a counter cry to
go up from the munition workers,
in order to save themselves from
army service, that Ireland, which
contains no munition factories out
side of Antrim, bo forced by com
pulsion to'supply 300,000 men.
It Is well understood in Dublin
that ono of the objects of the law
under way In Australia to compel
enforced army service Is to force
the Irish in Australia to join the
army. There Is a largo Irish popula
tion in tho Australian colonies who
aro considered recalcltraant on tho
war and extremely opposed to en
listing in the British army,, espe
cially slnco the executions of the
Irish prisoners of war, which news,
horrified tho Austiallan Irish, a3'
many of their leading men had
fathers who were expatriated Irish
political prisoners.
John Redmond has assured his
supporters that he will continue to
lead tho party In opposition to any
plan of enforced military service
that includes Ireland. If Australia
votes for conscription In tho coming
referendum the difficulty of keeping
Ireland out will increase, but Red
mond's defense will be that Aus
tralia Is a self-governing colonoy
while Ireland Is not. Joseph Devlin
has started a campaign against en
forced service among the National
ists in the North. But it is ad
mitted that tho purely Irish regi
ments have about disappeared and,
ns the military authorities point out,
there will soon be none unless tho
wastage is filled from Ireland. Cas
ualty lists show an amazing num
ber of non-Irish names for Irish
regiments. What November will
bring forth no man can tell. Tho
people will revolt rather than be
forced into the army, but they havo
few arms wSh which to defend their
homes when entered by the military,
who will drag out tho unarmed men
and carry them to military prisons.
