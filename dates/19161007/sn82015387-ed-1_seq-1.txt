NOT WILLING TO
HAVE WOMEN
BLAMED
Objects to Criticism That
Mandeville Organizations
Do Not Pull Together.
,Mandeville, La., Sept. 30, 1916.
Editor St. Tammany Farmer:
Referring to the editorial in St.
Tammdny Farmer of Saturday, Sep
temnber, 23, in which the writer ad
vaiitys the opinion that the cause of
Mandeville not making the progress
that opportunity and the times seem
to present is due to factions, par
ticularly among the organized bodies
of the tow'n. As a woman actively
laterested in the women's organiza
stone here I most strenuously object
to' this .opinion. How Mandeville
has acquired this reputation I know
not, but it looks like a case (,par
don the use of a slang expression)
"give a dqg a bad name and it will
stick." That there has been, and
may still be for ought I know, differ
ence of opinions, petty disputes be
tween individuals, I will not deny;
but that this has extended to any
one organization of women I most
emphatically deny. Take the *two
moat prominent women's organiza
tions here, the School League and
the Progressive Union, we have a
number of women who belong to
both, and-giving their best interests
to both. 'Last winter on two occa
sions entertainments were given for
the school, either 'by the League or
soMme- one interested in the echool,
and oanlIboth of these occasions the
Prolgre ie Union gave their hail
gladigr' Ebedes the giving of dong
tdons '.Qy `individual members. So
miuch lwa. the interest taken by the
Union in the 4chool work, that it rwas
Sa sanditg rule whenever anything
.was given for, the school thehall was
to 'b eave freq of al 'charges. Thl
s .sIy_ 'saId, of the League in
atteAidg Iiy .ffairs of the Union.
Ie t.* ' ctfozis? What a pity that
those- e- dulW it is to look after
the:inte*est of the school to try to
hide behind the so-called troubles
and ipoets of the women.
For the last few years, .nd longer
perhaps, thbe women have worked
faithfully to have as long a session
as possible. And each year as the
opening of school approaches they
look forward to a winter of work,
and hard Woi'), to give the children
a good school term. What, pray
may I ask, are the men doing? Are
school leagues, progressive unionus or
any other civic bodies of women or
ganized for the sole punpose of keep
ing the schools open? Where ire
those who are elected to once for
that purpose? They get the honor
and it is a case of "let the woh1en do
the work." I am not trying" to
preach suffrage, as I am not inclined
that way (although it seems to be a
good way as so many intelligent wo
men sale going in that direction), 4but
I have a very high regard for the
ability of my *ex and feel confident
if they. were given a chance they
would, if not do better, do no worse
than the men are doing. It strikes
me as being, alpiost funny how some
men confuse the words "interest"
and ".meddlilg,"- as soon as twome'i
or an organization of women ask
questions, suggest ideas, or jp umse
to criticize what men are doilTg and,
are Interested enough to want to
help, the first thing you hear is "why
dou't the women mind their oAn at
fairs and stay at hºie and 'stop
m.ddling?" Such has been the case
here in JMandeville. repeatedly
have Ie tried and just as many times
has no attention been paid to us
and 'we were considered as mteddling.
The school situatioh today in Man
deville is not due to the fact that
there is no unity of action between
the oziganised bodies of women, al
though that is the impression, but
it is due most likely to the ftet that
the .:a;tiferent school oaelals are not
doingtheir 4mty. Why have taxes?

REStOLUTIONS
TO JUDGE J. B.
LANCASTER
Deceased Judge is Commem
orated in Words of
High Praise.
May It please the Honorable Chief
Justice and Associate Justices of
the Supreme Court of Louisiana:
On Tuesday evening, May 30, 1'916,
Joseph Bradford Lanaester, Judge
of the Twenty-Sixth Judicial District
Court for the parishes of St. Tam
many and Washington, State of Lou
isxana, departed this life.
F"ollowing an 'honored custom,
your committee has had the melan
chloly honor of being appointed to
arart reso.utione to present to this
Honorable Court- in commemoration
of the distinguished dbad.
The subject of this memorial was
born in brookhaven, Miss., on April
10, 1atin, of distinguished lineage.
He was a son of William Blair Lan
caster, lawyer and veteran of the
Mexican and Civil Wars, and Jose
phine Morgan; a grandson of Joseph
Bradford -Lanoaster, once an Asso
ciate Justice of the Supreme Court.
of Florida, and Annie Blair; a great
grandson of General David B. Mor
gan, who won -fame in the Battle of
New Orleans, and MaLry Constance
Baham; a great-great grandson of
Rev. John, Blair, D. D., once the pres
ident of Princeton College, New Jer
sey, and of John B. Baham, one of
tae earldest settlers .f the parish of
.t. Tammany, and the founder of the
town of Madisonville, in that parish;
and a descendant of the Lancaster
who settled $, Maryland, under pat
exits issued 'by the British Crown in
1r641, which are still in the posses
sion of the Lancaster family.
1He graduated at the Jesuits Col
e in New. Orleans ana took up
the study of law in the ofice of hib
father, then a lawyer in New Orleape.
Upon his father's death young Ian
caster removed to St. Tammany par
ish. Here he served as Deputy
Clerk of Court and as Deputy Sheriff.,
During tlis time he continued . his
law studies and in' June 1902, after
examination .before this Court, was
admitted to the bar. The same year
he married Amanda Doerr, of Cov
ington, Louisiana, and was elected to
the Legislature from 8t"~Tammany
parish, and thereafter, upon the ex
piratiion of 'his term of office as Rep
resentative, was elected Superintend
ent of Education of that parish. By
iis uatiring energy and zeal in ad
mitislering the educational ffrairs
of the parish, he succeeded in plat
ing the public slchool system of St
Tammany on a sound basis and laid
the foundation for the splendid to-,
sition which ,the school.system of
that parish now enjoys.
In 1904 he was elected District
Attorney of the Twenty-Sixth Ju
dicial District, and discharged the
duties and obllgsaions 'qf that office
with ability, conlscientiousness, fideli
ty and justice. "
In 1912 he was elected Judge of
,the same District, which olce he
filled with honor and distinctiion,
until, at the full tide of his powers,
that All Wise Providence which com
mands the destinies of men sudden
ly ordered him from our midst.. He
met the shadow ~tanding and with a
firm grasp of his staff.
,As a Judge his marked character
istics were the industry and patience
with which he idtestigated the quee
$ions presented for his adjudication,
had the strong sense of fairness and
impart.blity which caused him to
strive always to do justice between
litIgants. Above all he remembered
the conclusion of the Roman Twelve
Tables--"Salus populi suprema lex."
As a man Joseph B. Lancaster was
a sincere and .consistent christian;
he waj ever outtpoken aid fearless
in rbis attitude 'on every qugetion in
which hetwas interested; le one ever
had a doabt as to hobW B ;eibo; -ori
