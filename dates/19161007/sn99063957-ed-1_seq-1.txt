More Than 40,000 Fans See Most Exciting Contest of the
Season Brooklyn Got First Blood in the Fourth, and
- Boston Tallied In Fifth Last Inning Was a Thriller
with Score 6 to 5 and Bases Full When End Came
By H. C. Hamilton, -
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
Braves Field, Boston, Mass., Oct. 7. The Boston Red
Sox took the "jump" game cf the 1916 world's series from
Brooklyn today but it was only by an eye lash. The Red
Sox finished up on the long end of a six to five score, but a
remarkable ninth inning rally by the Dodgers, coupled
with the weakening of Ernie Shore, in the box for Boston,
and an error by Janvrin nearly upset the world's cham
pions. . For five innings Shore and Marquard worked in
asretty a pitching duel as has been seen on Braves Field
in some time. The crowd of upwards of 40,000 sat spell
bound as the rival pitchers fought it out.
Marquard was the first to crack, but Shore got his in
the ninth when Carl Mays relieved him. Pfeffer acted as
relief worker to the Rube. The game was remarkable in
a way for the lack of enthusiasm usually displayed at the
opening encounter of a world's series.
BROOKLYN
BOSTON
A. handful o loyal Brooklyn rooters
v, hooped it up when tho Dodgers were
tbnking their drive in the ninth, but oth
erwise reul spontaneous outbursts of
ehecring and the old whoop 'er-up stuff
was lacking.
In former years, thousands of rooters
I'.tve paraded about the .field behind
the band after n Boston victory, the
e rowd here thi.-t afternoon simply got up
and went home. The bond paraded
once around the' field-but practically
ft'one and then'gave up tho ghost.
Fred Merkle had a chance to become
the world's series hero in the ninth
inning, but failed. He came up with
only one out and the bases full. Three
r,:us would have tied the score. lie
drew ball, then a strike, and so on un
til the count stood at the proverbial
t'roe and two. The crowd stood tense.
But when Shore pitched the last one
wide, Merkle walked, forcing in. a run.
The Ked Sox entered the ninth inning
with a five ruu lead- Daubert walkei
mid singles by .Stengel, Olson and Myers
oeupled with Janvrin 's error and Cut
shaw being hit by a pitched ball, kept
the bases choked to such an extent that
four runs came over. Against Boston's
one error tbeDodgcrs had four. They
didn't look like champions today. Ol
son made two bad fumbles, Cutshaw
contributed a muff of an easy liner and
irengcl uncorked a wild throw.- The
)ume will rank up with most any
world 's series contest in tho number of
ei:rra base hits that were made. Wheat
n id Chief Meyers of the Dodgers each
. connected for triples. Walker and Hob
litzell of the Red Sox also drew three
j'ly swats, and Hooper, Lewis and Janv
riii smashed out. doubles.

ning a world's series as they were of
topping this 1910 tilt. But, fresh from
the wilds of Flntbush, Wilbert Robin
sou and his Dodgers are full of fight
and promised to give the Box the buttle
of their uvea.
The Red Sox were the first to appear
on the field. They came tumbling out
of their dugout only a few minutes after
12 o'clock and immediately took the
field for batting practice. The Boston
warriors swung only ' at left handed
shoots. In anticipation of Rube. Mar
quard, Carrigan had only southpaws
serving them up to his swatsmitlis. In
the meantime a cabaret sextette made
sour music. - A band did its best to
drown, out the megaphone shouters but
was only partially successful.
The Royal Rooters band was on the
grounds" early, well supplied with lung
power, to toot "Tessie" all over the
place.
The arrival of the Dodgers was fore
cast by the appearance of the shadow
of Wilbert Robinson's stomach on the
field shortly before 1 o'clock. A sec
ond later Robbie himself appeared, fol
lowed by the entire Brooklyn crew
Dodgem Begin Practice.
At 11:15 the Dodgers took the dia
mond for batting and fielding practice.
Marquard, Smith and Pfeffer warmed
i.p for Brooklyn, Dutch Leonard took
n light workout for Boston.
The Dodgers also practiced their slug
ging on -southpaw shoots, expecting eith
er Kuth or Leonard to pitch. They also
showed speed by running out their hits
with sprints down to first base.
The stands filled slowly. There were
large patches of vacant seats in the
main grandstand and few boxes were
occupied at 1:2U.

their fielding practice with 4he greatest
snap.
It appeared certain that cither Shore
or Ruth would take the slab.
At 1:49 the stands were practically
filled and the crowd was still pouring in.
Governor Tener and other members of
the National commission arrived at this
time. President J.nnuin of the Red Sox
also appeared and was given a rousing
cheer.
Robinson and Carrigan posed for the
camera man with hands clasped, and
Bobby wore a cherubic smile.

WHAT THE FANS DID
Pilled With Hot Dog and En
thusiasm Went Early and
. Stood Pat
By George Martin.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Braves Field, Boston, Mass., Oct. 7.
(0 a. m.) Here were the forehanded
fans, entirely surrounded by dew and
dawn. Filleod with hot dogs and a de
sire to see the game. Dimmed in shivers
and engulfed in yawns.
If it hadn't been for Marsh of Van
couver, the wait would have been awful.
He was the maddest Britisher that ever
ate marmalade for . breakfast. The
streot was strewn with the r's he drop
ped and the way he treated his h ' was
a sin.
Marsh and his wife, it seems, picked
Boston mid started for the scries early
last month with cash and hopes for a
grandstand seat. Hiding out on Broad
way, over behind tho Hudson river till
they were sure of the winner, they
pounced upon the high priests of the
Red Sox by letter; .mail and phone.
Somehow their double, play was a foozle
and here they were in line-
At .5 a, m. they ran our of conversa
tion, bought the services of two grubby
and diminutive Boston terriers to hold
their places In line and went to bed.
From then on until daylight it was
dull for the disciples of watchful wait
ing, but dawn brought a woman with a
mole on her chin and a square meal in
her band. She began to talk on arrival
and at a late hour her mole was still
waving madly.
"I not only got up with the birds,"
she said, "but I am one: I am also Mrs.
C. A Hawkins, of Boston. I brought
my luuch, but I wont have time to eat
it- I've been doing this for three years
now and I make a point of keeping
up the conversation until long after the
game is over. It amuses the boys and
it doesn't bother me; I'm used to it
And bv the way, vou may be interested
to know that the Rod Sox will win three
straight, drop one'and take the fifth.'
With Mrs. Hawkes was her- sister,
.urs. Louise loung, of Chicago. Mrs.
Young, who isn't so very talkative, did
not snv a word. She could not.
First in line all night was Celeste
Gazzinza, of Boston. This patient per
son .with a name like a Metropolitan
tenor nnd a face color of a plug of to
bacco, draped himself over the dollar
section wicket gap nnd slept on the wire
entanglements-
Joe Mizella came un from Philadel
phia a few minutes later and got be
hind him. All through the night they
shared their chills and chewing tobac
co. Fred Marden, of Wilkesbarre, Pa.,
also srnvercd.
.Tack Corry came in from Bretton
Woods, bought a hole in the line, in
stalled a watcher, and, wrapping himself
warmly in slumber, lay dawn under a
tree.
These crowds are not what they used
to be. Old Man Kxpcricnce has taught
them thnt they don't have to be early
board worm.
Time was when thev came bv hun
dreds from all parts of the country,
oum a soup oox city and camped be
side the concrete battlements. A dozen
roaring caiupfires. several all niirht vest
pocket restaurants and innumerable
sleeping concessions were common then.
Here last night there were fewer than
150 waiters at all eut ranees and only
one camp fire. The fans know they
can do just as well and buy places iii
Hue just as cheaply if they' wait until
8 or so the morning of the first dav'a
gum p. -
ho it came to pass today that dawn's
left hand had been in the sky a long
time before the great majority of the
fans came swarming off the street cars
with their right hands in their pock
ets.

By Carl W. Ackertnan.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
The Hague, Sept. 17. (By mail.)
The Dutch government only two months
ago sounded the European belligerents
eu the prospects ,of peace, the United
Press was informed today. Every bel
ligerent except France, expressed a will
ingness to enter an informal discussion.
France's reply was sueh a fiery refusnl
that one person wo learned its contents
described it asJ'almost an ultimatum."
(A Rome dispatch to the United Press
yesterday carried the first, iutination
that Holland had been putting out peace
feelers,-' This dispatch stated, that the
allies had informed Holland that peace
overtures at this time would be con
strued as a pro-German move.)
Dutch officials have not only resumed
their attempt at peace negotiations, but
they are how convinced that the end o'i
the war is a long way off.
The one positive indication that peace
is impossible at present is tho wide dif
ference of opinion between each of the
opposing sides regarding the situation
in the ranks of the other. During the
past few days I have been in Copenhag
en, Berlin, The Hague and Rotterdam.
The first impression obtained by a trav
eler is the wide chasm between the con
tending parties.
Germany Confident.
Copenhagen, which ft tremendously
anti-German, believes, that Germany is
about to fall to pieces. ' There are re
ports of unrest, starvation, depression
und lack of soldiers In Germany. The
people of Copenhagen and also residents
of The Hague believe the allied otren
sive on the Somme, in Russia and Cla-
licia and Hungary is having great sue
cess. They can't understand why the
much talked or revolution" in Ger
many doesu't begin. No one pays any
attention to the German victories in Ru
mania. In Berlin there is some depression,
some pessimism, but the faith in the
ability of the army to hold out Is not
being" shaken. Everyone In Germany
keeps maps of the battle fronts and
watches the progress of the fighting
closely. The people have amazing faith
in Von Hindenburg. Interest centers in
Mackensea s offeusive in Rumania.
The Berlin newspapers emphasize the
shortage of British tonnage. They de
clare food prices have advanced us
much in England as in Berlin. Franco,
Berliners believe, has exhausted her re
serves and her army is weakening daily
more than any other army.
The streets'of Berlin, Frankfort, Bre
men nnd all large German cities nre full
of soldiers all the time, refuting the oft-
repeated statement that Germany has
exhnusted her reserves.
"The allies are losing 5,000 men a
day on the western front," was the way
one German put it. "I suppose our los
ses are great, too, but we can keep it
up as long as tbey can. We will hold
out until the allies get enough of it."
United States Not In It
Washington, Oct. 7 Likelihood of the
United States government acting as a
prominent factor to bring pence to the
warring powers o'f Europe is dwindling
day by day, according to general belirf
in official circles here.
The subject is once more receiving
diplomatic consideration on the event of
Ambassador Gerard's return to this
country from Berlin, Count Von Bern-
storff 's visit to the president at Shiulow
Lawn next Monday, and as a result ot
the president's continued utterances on
the subject of world pence for the fu
ture. Two toints nrp made by those who be
lieve the United States will make no
further move to Aid the hostilities
and probably will be unable to aid in
tho readjustments between the Euro
pean countries when the war ends:

Hops Selling Freely
At 11 and lHiCents;
Car Shortage Affects
The hop growers association of this
city reports a fairly active sale of hops
at tho present time. The price ranges
from 11 to 11K cents a pound and the
demand is good. A ear load was sold,
yesterday and scarcely a day passes
without recording a salo.
The ear shortage on the Southern Pa
cific is a bad feature of the situation
since it is tying up the money of grow
ers on sales already made. The money
is not duo from the purchaser until the
hops are aboard the cars.
little Woman Delights Big
Audience Senator Gar
land's Forceful Speech
0
The Grand opera house was well fill
ed last night, the occasion being the
address by Mrs. Alexander Thompson,
of The Dalles, on the subject, "Why
we Should Vote for Woodrow Wil
son." The advance notice sent of her
called her "the Demosthenes of Ore
gon-" The title is no misnomer, for she
is an orator, naturally so. It is told in
history that : Demosthenes hesitated in
his speech and overcame the defect by
s pen king with pebbles in his mouth.
With Mrs. Thompson, being a woman,
of course she never had any natural im
pediment in her speech, and con
sequently never bad to do the pebble
act. InsUycV she nan yearls and sne
dropped them one after another, pearls
of wisdom, gems of thought, sparkling
wit, keen humor, and profound deeps of
leeiiug as she uisenssed some of the
great things accomplished by our presi
dent in his strenuous three years and
a half at the head of tho government.
iter views on suffrage are broad
she taking the ground that the so-called
woman's party was the greatest handi
cap the woman had to bear in their
struggle for the ballot. She spoke with
biting sarcasm- of the train load of wo
men who had not yet earned the ballot
coming west to suffrage states to tell
4,000,000 women who have tho ballot
how' they, should tote. On this subject
she told a story of a hard working girl
at Hkeneateles, New York, whose daily
life - was one of litter drudgery, and
whose sole pleasure . was reading the
Sunday papers and hoping that some
time she might enjoy some of the pleas
ures she read about. After a long time
she gave up all hope in this line and
realizing as she read of social" doings,
that it was never for her, she threw it
aside and consoled herself by' saying:
"Maybe it isn't so." She said when she
read of tho woman's party and their
threat to throw the votes of the women
of the suffrage states against Mr. Wil
son she eonsoled herself with the
thought: "Maybe it isn't so." "1
don't believe it Is," she added, "for I
do not believe the 4,000,000 women of
the suffrage states can be dictated to
by a group of non-voters and have their
collective vote handed to anyone." She
declared that women were the monety
spenders, and that it was really of more
importance in the domestic economies
than tho earning of it by father.
When Adam Learned Wisdom.
The women were educated spenders
and would bring economy into public
affairs just as they did in their house
hold affunrs. Incidentally Bhe remark
ed that man never had wisdom until
women gave it to him. That sacred his
tory showed how it was Evo who first
plucked the apple nnd obtained wis
dom, nnd then generously gave Adam
n bite and taught him wisdom. " Why,"
she snul whimsically, "if it had not
been for Eve old Adam would be hang
lug around in the garden jot."
She said the women would not at
tempt to punish Wilson because con
gress hnd not tuken steps to make suf
frage national, and in telling what they
would be punishing him for, reached a
height of eloquence that held the audi
ence breathless until at the conclusion
of her glowing tribute the big house
suddenly broke into a storm of appmuse
that would not stop.
Those who heard Mrs.Thompson had
an evening they will long remember
arm those who did not will never know
how miii-h they missed, because no one
eau tell them about It. it was one of
those events that can only be understood
or enjoyed by personal presence, for
words cannot describe it uuless it was
the sumo words used by her and then
the meaning her clear enunciation and
splendid delivery gnve them would be
lacking nnd weaken their force.
The Cherry Bud bund gnve several
selections before the doors and a couple
after entering the house which were
heartily applauded. Mrs. Halley ParUh
Hinges snug in her best voice and re
sponded to an encore- Mrs. Enright
spoke briefly nnd happily on suffrage,
and then Mr. P. I,. Frazier in a brief
talk introduced Senator Garland who
mnde a most telling speech, pointing
out one by one the achievements of the
aduiinistrntion nnd winning much ap
plause. His points were well made aod
his description of -Mr. Hughes delivered
bound huud and foot into the power ot
Roosevelt nnd Taft was apt. In con
cluding he spoke of the German vote
being in favor of Hughes, and expressed
his astonishment thnt the Intelligent
thinking Germans could support a man
who was advised ly Konseveit who him
self was tho avowed enemy, of Germany.
