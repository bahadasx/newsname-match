liiickly and the fielding workouts

Crushes Past Hopes.

PRESIDENT LOSES OPTIMISM
Not Informed That Gerard Is
on Peace Mission.
Will Not Offer Further "Good
Offices" to End- War.
Washington, Oct. 7. Likelihood of
the United States government acting
as a nrominent factor to bring peace
to the warring powers of Europe is
dwindling day by day. according to
general belief in official circles here.
The subject once more is receiving
diplomatic consideration on the ev
of Ambassador Gerard's return to thi
country from Berlin, Count von Bern
storff's visit to the president at Shad
ow Lawn next Monday and as a result
of the president's continued utterances
on the subject of world peace for the
future.
Two points are made by those who
believe the United States will make
no further move to end the hostilities
and probably will be unable to aid
in the readjustments between the
European countries when the war
ends:
Two Reasons for Xo .Move.
FiistGreat Britain, thru an inter
view given the United Press by Lloyd
George, has plainly said "hands off"
that any attempt by the United
States to intercede in behalf of peace,
would be regarded with hostility.
Second The political situation in
the country has aroused to a marked
degree partisan feelings for one or th
other of the warring sides. It ha re
sulted in stirring up a feeling abroad
that tie United States is not "strictly
neutral" and, as President Wilson re
cently said in an address at Shadow
Lawn, this feeling has reached a point
where even diplomatic intercourse be
tween this country and foreign nations
will be seriously embarrassed until
after November 7, because foreign
diplomats are waiting to see what will
be the outcome of the election.
Perhaps no expression by the presi
dent in recent months has aroused so
much conjecture here as that in
Omaha Thursday night when he said:
Wilson Anticipates Long War.
" "When we look forward to the years
to come I wish I could say the
months to come and to the end of
this war, we want the world to know
we are ready to lend our force to the
preservation of peace."
This is regarded here as indicative
that the president feels the end of the
war may be far off and also that he
feels the work of America will be to
preserve the peace of the future, not
to intervene now. From those with
the president comes the word that he
knows nothing regarding a report that
Ambassador Gerard is bringing with
him to this country a request of tin
German government to Intercede in
behalf of peace. But there is a strong
belief in official circles here that the
president will consider no further
move either directly or indirectly
toward offering his good offices unless
such a plea is made openly by one or
more of the belligerent nations.
