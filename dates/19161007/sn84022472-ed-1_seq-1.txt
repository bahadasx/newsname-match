HOW THE RIVAL
VIEW
BY WILBERT ROBINSON,
Manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers , ;
, The fans have an idea that the Dodgers are not game but
don't you believe it. My boys had a hard fight for the pennant
and the 'strain of the race caused them to slump at times. But
you noticed, probably, that when it was necessary to tighten
up the Dodgers could do it. ' .
The Red Sox are favored in the betting odds because of
their great pitching staff and because of their experience in
previous struggles for the world's title. The Dodgers are bet
ter hitters than Carrigan's men, however, and don't be sur
prised if we jolt a few of their twirlers. We'll give 'em the
best we have every minute no matter what the result is.
BY WILLIAM
Manager of the
We are all primed and ready for the fight. We have been
taking things easy since we cinched the pannant, and all of
the boys are in fine condition botlj mentally and physically
for the struggle. '-r
v. We are not underestimating the Brooklyn clubbut we
confidently believe, that we lill win. Without doubt Robin
son has' a powerful club with the bat,- but our pitchers have
been facing just" as good hitters, and they have not failed to
come, through when the real test came. Furthermore, our
previous experience will stand us in good stead. In a seriel
like this, the main thing is to get in there and battle from start
to finish. I know that my bunch is as game as they make
'em, and will fight. '' j. ' - - " ,:
, v Anyway, we are prepared to put up, our best fight," and if
"we are beaten, we wiBhhave no alibi to "bf f er.

" Reach Thousands
Manufacturing duplicate business
letter heads of prominent Bridgeport
merchants, and impersonating the dif
ferent heads of the concerns, a clev
er swindler, as a result of his entens-
ive operation's in this city, is believed
to have victimized wholesale houses
throughout the country of thousands
of dollars' worth of goods and mer
chandise. '
The magnitude of his swindling-
the method of which stamp's him as a
crook of exceeding-winning has not
as .yet been determined by the po
lice. -
It has Just been learned that he
swindled the W. A. Taylor fco., whole
sale importers; of olive oil, of a quan
tity of goods, the retail value bf which
is about $250.
The swindler In come manner pro
cured a copy of the business letter
paper of the Eugene L. Sullivan Co.,
in East Main street, at Jane stceet.
He had copies printed and wrote to
the New York Olive 'Oil Co. for
quotations on' its product. The prices
were mailed him at the address given
on his letter head, "615 Main street."
. He then ordered quantities of the oil
to be sent him in half galMn and gal
lon cans, to be delivered ty him at the
local railroad yard. The goods were
delivered to a teamster now under
arrest, pending Defective Holbrook's
investigation, named John Noonan,who
resides in the South End.
Before sending the goods- Mr. Sulli-
van's rating was looked up in a mer-
. 1 1 tMfnw whlnH fall tn crtvA
iuuio .. yyw , j. ..-. . "... -j - -. ..v
the"a4d"ress of most of the "Blg con
cerns in this city, merely listing tbem
under ' the name, Bridgeport. When
his rating was found to be high, the
goods were of course immediately
shipped. ' . . 1 . ' s
A number of bills -for the goods
were sent to the lodging house, at 615
Main Street, bu a check was , never
forthcoming, with the result that the
bill finally reached the, hands of the
real Mr. Sullivan at Jane and East
Main streets. . " . ' ' '
He informed the I New York con
cern of their error and an investiga
tion unearthed the fact that they had
been duped. It was learned at the
lodging house whWe the swindler had
hired a room, that he neWsr slept
there, telling the landlady that owing
to the great press of his business he
had-been out of town, calling merely
to receive his mail, which ranged from
10 to 20 letters -a day.
. The much sought individual .is de
scribed as a slight buirt, dark com
plexioned jman, dressed in the heigh
of fashion," carrying a cane and hav
ing every appearance of culture ;and
refinement. Glib of tongue, he so im
pressed his landlady that she thought
him a future magnate.
'The police are at a loss to under
stand how he disposed of the goods
which he-received and in the instance
of the olive oil case the arrest of'Nbo
nan proved of. no help, as fhe team
ster asserts he cannot remember to
whom he delivered the goods after
taking them from the freight house.
A canvass of th,e business houses
will be made in an effort to ascertain
if they, have been receiving bills for
goods which they never ordered.
Ambrose Dowling, the Bostpn repre
sentative of the W. A. Taylor Co., who
was sent here to ravel the fraud,
found on visiting the lodging house
that the supposed Sullivan had de
parted some weeks ago. It was then
he' appealed to the police. The author
ities statv that the ' olive oil swindle
occurred last July, and inasmuch as
it has taken nearly four months tp
'i of this one case, they fear others
may momentarily be brought to light.

Under Control.
DEPOSIT OF $100 IS
PAID T6 ONIJ SELLER
Action of Housing Commit
tee Follows Meeting
Held Yesterday.
v Plans for the million dollar
Bridgeport Housing Co. colony have
progressed to a point where it is def
initely known today that purchase of
about 100 acres of laVid nearthe Han
dy & .Harman factory in Fairfield is
considered. j i
Though denial w today made by
H. H. DeLoss, president of the
Bridgeport Housing Co., and head of
the Handy & Harman factory. It is
asserted in many quarters that the
company has tentatively closed ne
gotiations for the purchase of the
Honeyspot tract of land owned by O.
G. Jennings and 'others of Fairfield
the Andre-vy Wakemln property, for
merly knoWn as the Wakeman-Moie-house
farm, the Sylvanus. Bec'kwith
land, and other tracts in the vicinity
of Barley Lane, the railroad, Gallos
road and Wakeley street. A deposit
of $100 is asserted to have been paid
Henry Williams, by the Bridgeport
Housing Co. on an eight acre tract
and house now occupied by a tenant,
John Jerles.
' When asked to confirm the deals
today, H. H. DeLoss said:
"We have made no purchases. We
have taken1 no definite action. We
have paid no money for property but
are looking at many different proper
ties in various sections."
Opposed to these statements Is that
of Henry Williams of Fairfield, who
said: I "'
! "The Bridgeport Housing Co. has
bought my land. They have already
naid me S100 deposit. I understand
that they have also bought the Honey-
i . . .i.- . - w.v.
spot tract, the Andrew .Wakeman
property.-'tmaTse'veral other pieces lid
joining. , Negotiations for other tracts
of land on the hill Is now in pro
gress."
Andrew Wakeman of Fairfield, said
"It is true that the Bridgeport Hous
ing Co. has made me an offer for our
property. I understand li is to be
taken hv the comnanv. but thev have
not as yet taken deeds or . paid me
any money.
The land under consideration 'is
partly high ground but much is
swamp land and flooded during part
of the spring months. Of the tract
known as the "Hpneyspot," compris
ing about 60 acres in Its entirety,
about two-thirds is swamp land feed
iikg into Ash Creek through. a small
tributary. It Mes justi above what was
formerly "known as the Fairfield Acid
works. The Wakeman tract is adja
cent to the railroad tracks .across from
thef Handy & Harman factory. It
contains between 30 and 35 acres. The
Henry Williams tract on Barley Lane
contains between eight and nine acres
of high-ground. The Sylvanus Beck
with tract is opposite the Honeyspot
tract on the Wakeley street road, as
it is commonly, called, and contains
about 10 acres. ' ' -
Frederick C. Blanchard, general
manager of the Bridgeport. Housing
Co., who ,attended a meeting of the
housing committee, which met In the
First-Bridgeport National bank yes
terday for the purpose of considering
properties, said this morning: "We
are considering Several properties. I
cannot, talk on the subject at this
time but will do so at theV proper
time."
Realty experts declare that the
tract in question, though highly suit
able for housing artisans working in
factories, in the extreme West End of
the cityl is some distance from the
present trollevJine that runs through
Fairfield avenue, but is contiguous to
the railroad, which by means of
another station could carry passengers
to and from Bridgeport station. This,
however, would tnean additional trolley
lares lor tne worKers. .
' The greatest drawback to building
operations in that section is said to be
the fact that a large part of the
Honeyspot tract would have to be
filled to run streets through It, which
would be a most costly operation un
less the properties adjoining were
purchased at such figures as to permit
of extensive grading. ,

Hon. Homer S. Gummings, of,

series of debates to discuss the 'j
issues of the campaign in the.
principal cities of the. state, one
which may be staged in. Bridge
porU The challenge,, if accept
ed by Senator McLean, will en- .
liven the campaign in the state
such a it has not beeiptaennven "1
ed in years. The simultaneous
appearance of these two emin-.
ent candidates, on the stump
would treat the voters of the '
state to a display of oratory not!
heard since Civil War times, or
even before, when .the famous'
Lincoln-Douglas debates stir
red up things poljjically.'
, Both Senator McLean kind Mr. Cum-,
niings are brilliant orators. ' Senator;
the spring conventional b's party held
in New Haven to elect delegates to
the national convention, and Mr. Cum-,
mings made the keynote speech at the
Democratic convention held lit New
Haven to nominate State officers. Mr.
ICummings idea in- challenging j Mr.
I McLean is that the issues of the cam-,
paign can best be presented to theJ
electorate of the state in this manner,
and though he admits that it is a bit!
old-fashloned, he believes It would!
give a better 'opportunity than anyl
other medium to' set forth claims ofi
the respective parties. , '
The invitation to Senator McLean,,
has been sent through the Democratic
state chairman, David ' E. Fitzgerald,
who is empowered by Mr. Cummlngs
to act, to the "chair man of the Repub-i
lican State .. Central . committee, J.I
Henry Roraback, and is as follows:

spectlvely, in the state, I feel thafH
you and I have a far greater ' duty.
than in merely attending to the de-

refer to the duty of placing before the
voters of Connecticut for their de-J

issues of the campaign. t
"There are many ways by whtctii
this end may be achieved, but most of
the ordinary methods are open to par

"There : Is one method, however-
which I feel will appeal above alii
others to the voters of Connecticut. It!
is a method which enables the setting'
forth of the claims of both sides si
multaneously, clearly and without
confusion. It is a method which is
perhaps a little old fashioned, but in
that very respect is strong through
having been honored by some of the
giants of American political history.
I refer to the medium of publlo de
bate.
"For this purpose I am empowered
to extend an invitation or challenge
to Senator George' P. McLean of,
