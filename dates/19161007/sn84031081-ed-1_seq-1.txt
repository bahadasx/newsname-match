Can the Leopard Change Its Spots?
W hat has New Mexico to Iiom' from a return to the sort of govern

stale a iiiop'iient to tlietr inefficiency a glaring danger sign ugiiiiist
c Mietr rcliui, to HVHt r.
I nder the old republican regime education was at a lower c'di
than ccr at any time in the history of New Mexico. There was prac

Now i lie Miliars are asked li return to power a set of men whose
inefficiency and unfitness, have hceii .clearly anil unmistakably ilcition
stralcd. It is not claimeil by any one of these candidates that they would iln
any differently if doled tJns jear I .an the) did when they held oiriee

In this campaign there Is only one course for voters who want to
see New Mexico continue in the path of d clopmcnt and progress, anil
that Is to vote tlie ilcir.is ratlc ticket not liecaiise they are iIoiiiimtiiIs
