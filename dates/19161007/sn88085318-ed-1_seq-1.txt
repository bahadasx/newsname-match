In the present campaign for political
offices, with the number of candidate*
on the various tickets all demanding
the attention of the voter, It Is easy
to lose sight of some Issues which must
be met. and some offices which for the
safety of the public must be properly
filled regardless of what may happen
In other offices.
The office of judge of the superior
court of Stevens and Pend Orellle coun
ties is by all means the most Important
office to be filled—lmportant directly to
the people, In that It directly affects
taxes, property rights, and human lib
erty. Few other offices within the gift
of the people come so directly to them.
The primary election has placed two
candidates for this office before the
public—Daniel H. Carey and F. Leo
Giinstead, both attorneys residing In
Colville. Both are well known, their
vote was almost equal In the primary,
and one of them Is to be elected. Dur
ing the primary the Examiner made no
fight for any one of the three candi
dates, for It was apparent that the
Issue would not be settled at the pri
mary. Now the selection must be
made, and in the light of all the In
formation that can be gained, the
voters must register their choice.
Atty. F. Leo Orlnstead was admitted
to the bar in this state In 1906, and has
therefore practiced 10 years. In 1907
he formed a partnership with Atty. li.
During this period Mr. Grinstead as
sisted In many cases, but never took
any active part in the trial of any con
tested cause In the superior court.
Since Jan. 1, 1913, Mr. Grinstead has
been In business alone.
An examination of the records show
that Mr. Orlnstead has tended to his
business in a responsible manner, has
made friends, has built up a good prac
tice, and for a lawyer with only 10
He has never appeared before the su
preme court In the trial of any cause,
nor has he ever appealed any case to
the supreme court. Since he has been
in business for himself, he has engaged
and 4 cases with assistance of other
counsel. The superior court records
show that his main work has been In
default divorce cases, probate proceed
ings, and default actions on accounts,
nqtes and mortgage foreclosures.
Politically Mr. Grinstead has been
a most active man In this county, hav
ing been progressive county chairman,
and on returning to the republican
party was elected republican county
chairman, resigning that position only
a few months ago. He was chairman
of the republican county convention
held In Colville this' spring. He has
been a member of the Colville school
board for a number of years, and was
city attorney several terms, being de
feated last fall by the democratic coun
ty chairman F. Y. Wilson.
Daniel H. Carey has practiced law 27
years, having been admitted to the bar
in Minnesota In 1889. He practiced
law In Montana, later went to Ellens
burg: where he was associated with
Frank H. Rudkln, now federal Judge.
In the trial of many important cases
In 1897 he came to Northport and has
been a resident of Stevens county ever
since. In 1905 he was appointed juckv
of this county, was afterward twice
elected Judge, and four years ago was
not a candidate for reelection, desir
ing to return to the active practice of
law after having served as Judge for
8 years. During the last 4 years Judge
Carey was on the bench, data was com
piled from the decisions of the supremo
court showing the number of reversal*
of each Judge In the state, and Judge
Carey's reversals were fewer than
those of any other judge In the state —
a record of which he has a right to
be proud. He also gained a reputation
for being the best posted Judge In the
state on the water and mining law,
and In 1911 when a supreme judge wax
to be appointed by Governor Hay, the
attorneys of the bars of eastern Wash
ington united In a petition to have him
named, but the appointment was con
sidered to belong to the west side, ami
a west side man was appointed.
The record made by Judge Carey on
the bench Is known to all the citizens
of this county. His long training, his
ceaseless study of Intricate legal
points, his natural desire to see fair
play and to render decisions which
could not be reversed, brought him a
strength of standing in this county
which has demanded that he again
take the office of Judge.
As a sample of Judge Carey's ser
vice to this county, may be mentioned
the famous Logan case of some years
ago. The legislature had passed a law
prohibiting Judges from submitting the
question of Insanity to juries In mur
der cases. In the Logan case, Judge
Carey decided that the law was un-
constitutional, and permitted the ques
tion of Insanity to be submitted—ln the
face of the law of the state to the
contrary. Judge Take of Port Orchard
at the same time had a similar case
before him, and he held to the direct
statement of the law. The supreme
court sustained Judge Carey, and re
versed Judge Yake, entailing to his
county an expense of over $7,000, while
Stevens county was not compelled to
have any retrial because of the judged
deep study of law and his Important
decision. If the I^ogan case had been
retried In this county, the taxpayers
would have felt It, for that was one of
the heavy cases In the history of thin
county.
Another Interesting case In which
Judge Carey gained a decision new
to the courts of this state was In the
Weldenstelner water right case, where
in the supreme court decided In favor
of the new point of law brought out
by him. Many cases can be found of
record In this county wherein either
as Judge or lawyer his thorough knowl
edge of law has made him n legnl
strength In this county.
Since 1908, when he was elected as
a non-partisan Judge, Judge Carey has
not been Identified with political par
tie*. He Is an Independent republi
can, without partisan trimming*, and
belitVM in and has practiced the non
par tisan plan of Judiciary.
It is between these two men, then,
tlmt th« voters must choose. The Ex
kmlner finds four points on which It
believes the MleotiOß should be based
capability, fttMM for the position,
non-partltanahtp, and the question of
whether the candidate lias any spe
cial business alliances or entangle
ments or "strlnes" as they are com
monly called, which would In the least
prevent bim from being a fair and im
partial Judge in all cases.
As to capability, the record shows
that Judge Carey has an open proof In
the courts of Montana, of Washington.
of Stevens county, of the state su
preme court, and of the federal court,
that he Is most capable. Mr. Qrln
■tead'i 10 years of practice, with only
a few contested cases, put him at a
disadvantage as a candidate when op
posed to the 27 years of practice of
Judge Carey, with his many heavy
cases, and important decisions. It is
not to be supposed that a young man
can have handled us many phases of
le^al work In 10 years as one who has
practiced in different states, 'before
the various courts, for 27 years, hence
the drawing of a comparative cap
ability should not be taken as a dis
paragement of the younger man, but
only us showing that at present the
argument as to capability Is In favor
of .lu.iffe Carey,
Fitness for the position involves sev
eral elements —personality, character,
rectitude of conduct, and the ability
to hold the respect and confidence of
lawyer* and their clients.
Mr, Orlnstead is a member of sev
eral lodges, attend* the M. K. church,
le prominent socially, and no word can
be said against his personal character.
Borne complaints were made that he
Was lax in the enforcement <>r the or-
dlnancei when city attorney, but the
city seems to liave lived hIoml: all right
ami haa comparod iiuite favorably with
in.. si cities of the same size. It has
been stated that the $400 salary paid
by the schools of the city has I.een
the Inducement which allured him to
the school hoard membership, liut that
need not necessarily Ije counted in any
argument, for the judgeship. The one
thing which would seem to lm.paii' his
fitness for Judge is the settle.l an.l
fixed belief among the attorney* or the
bar that 1" net a fair trial an imtslile
Judpre must he called in. and that if
the Jackion-Qrlnitead trade is now
Consummated, tho sunn- condition! will
exist for another four years. There
exists a decided lie'.ief that firlnstead
was induced to resign from the race
four years ago and permit Jackson to
lie elected, with the understanding that
Orlnotead should 1»- elected this year.
There lias also grown up a belief among
• the lawyers that there Is an undue
bond of symputhy between Jackson
knd Grinstead and a certain few law
yers who v.«rf party to the deal four
years ago. Whether this belief is
based on an actual fact, we do not
knov.', but the one fact remains before
us that if Orinßtead were elected, this
county would for four years see a repe
tition of past yeara In the tiling of af
fidavits of prejudice, e> the extant thai
Stevens county taxpayers would find
themselves overburdened with costs
for vlsltinK Judges, or else be obliged
to follow the cases to Spokane, as has
been witnessed this year. There is
no use in electing a Judge if that Judge
can not sit on the cases brought Into
court. The fact exists, and must be
met.
Judge Carey is naturally of a social
nature, although he haa never been
much of a "Joiner." He Is noi a mem
ber of any church, but is a friend of
all. His two vices are chewing to
bacco and reading tho Congressional
Record, and his main pleasure Deems
to be that of sitting up nights, reading
law books, and studying the supreme
court decisions to see If they are right.
During his last two years on the bench
he received some censure by reason of
a use of liquor, which It might be said
was a common thing at that time
among the lawyerß of this and sur
rounding counties, even Including hlx
present opponent. During his first
(our years on the bench he was a total
abstainer, and for the last four years
has been "on the wagon," and despite
those few polite nhs which are still
being whispered about him, he Is about
is "dry" as can be found now days.
During local option days, when Judge
Carey was on the bench, he held the
record of the state for giving the
heaviest penalties to violators of the
liquor law. According to the lawyers
of Stevens and Pend Oreille counties,
Judge Carey Is trusted for fair decis
ion*, and will not be hampered by af
fidavits of prejudice. This Is a most
Important point in his favor, and should
l>e thoroughly Investigated.
Politically, both candidates are re
publican, and the democrats and pro
gressives and socialists and prohibi
tionists must choose a republican or
not vote. Mr. Qrlnstead has been ac
live in pfirty movementß t form?rly re -
publican, then progressive county
• liiilriniiii. then going back to the re
publicans, and resigning on county
'hairman only a few months at?o, al
though acting as chairman of the re
publican county convention after he
bad become a candidate for the Judge
ship. Rome voters have stated that
they will not BUpport Mr. Orlnstead
for two political reasons: He was twice
Instrumental In keeping .1. A. Hocbfonl
from being a candidate for election,
and has played partisan politics slnee
becoming a candidate for judge. TfcOM
who believe In a non-partisan Judi
ciary will not support any man for
Judge who Is radically partisan. Knur
.ears ago, when Mr. Roebford »» "
< andldate, the trade WiiH deferred until
he could be eliminated, iind this yenr.
when Mr. Rochford had a fair chance
of nomination, Mr Orlnstead was able
to have a letter sent broadcast by the
.ntl-saloon league Indorsing Orlnstead
.is the only dry man In the race, leav
ing the Impression that Rochford had
Kone over to the wet Interests. This
clever kind of trjeky politics Is not In
$1 Year in Advance; 5c Copy
keeping with the office of judgo.
Judge Carey has not been In politics
since IMS, when he was elected Judge
on tin. non-partisan ticket. Ills bit
llefs lire largely republican, yet he
does not argue them or seek to im
press them, nor has he made any po
litical stand In recent years. The Ex
aminer, although a democratic paper,
has no hesitancy In indorsing Judge
Carey's non-partisanship, but this can
not be Bald regarding his opponent.
The Examiner does not feel like sup
porting a candidate who Is fighting
the democratic party leadership In this
nation and state, and after three weeks
of Investigation and conference among
democrats of this and Pend Oreille
county regarding the serious situation,
It is found that the democrats do not
care to support for a non-partisan
judge any one who this year has been
actively opposing their party. Very
little expression has been heard from
socialists on this point If their vote
Is cast In Its entirety, It Is of consider
able proportion. Those prohibitionists
and anti-saloon league workers who
saw their organization used for Indi
vidual gain are resenting it, and al
though the Horton letter Is now a
thing of the past, the trick Is not for
gotten.
The fourth test by which a candi
date must he judged, Is that of which
one has the fewer business or poltlcal
alliances, or rather which one has no
•"strings" on him. This Is a more far
reaching and Important matter than
most people Imagine, for It not only
deals with the patronago which Is
given from the bench In the nature
of receiverships, appointments of at
torneys, etc., but It even goes to the
point of affecting decisions as between
opposing attorneys. There should be
no "Inside" to our superior court, and
there should be no favorites amonH
attorneys In the eyea of the judge
The attorneys now practicing before
the bar of this county are In the best
position to know the facts, and it in
suggested that these attorneya be
questioned by voters, as they are tho
ones who file the affidavits of prejudice
and will continue to do so unless con
ditions are changed. The fact thnt
many affidavits of prejudice are now
being filed against Judge Jackson, and
thnt he Js supporting Mr. Orlnstead,
must load to a serious consideration of
the charge being made by lawyers thnt
Mr. Qrlnatead is also tied by "strings"
to certain friendly parties. On the
other hand, the previous bench record
of Judge Carey, and the unanimity of
the legal support he Is receiving, lead
to the conclusion that he Is tied to no
Interests.
Summing up the facts regarding tlie
two candidates for Judge, the Examin
er finds that on all points Judge Carey
has the best claim to tho support of
the voters next month, and that the
public Interest will be best served by
his selection. Furthermore, the B*
amlner takes exception to the polit
ical activity of M# Orlnstead While
running on a supposedly non-partisan
ticket, and dealrei to mate that it will
not support a man fur judge who thin
year has born active In fighting tblH
paper's political ticket. No fault can
lie found with the active republicans
or locialiata who work for their favored
ticket, anil any lUCh honest support
should have the respect of men of all
parties. Rut a non-partisan Judge
must keep hands off of partisan poll
tics. Judge Carey has shown his sin
cerity on this point, by action on the
bench, and over since, iro haa a rlgi i
to receive support from voters of all
parties. And by reason of his capabil
ity, general fitness, his non-partlsan
shlp. and his freedom from any
"strings.! 1 the Examiner supporta his
candidacy.
