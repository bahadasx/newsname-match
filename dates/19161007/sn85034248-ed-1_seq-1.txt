"Saving the Family Name."
The distressed heroine of "Shoes"
is still fresh in the memory of those
who w~ere ptrtunate enough to witness
that enga oJg photoplay, and the news
that Mar M4fLaren will appear at
the Grand Theatre tomorrow in an
other Lois Weber production will be
hailed as assurance, in advance, that
'Saving the Family Name" will be a
production worthy of the best Blue
bird traditions. Miss MacLaren will
have Phillips Smalley as her leading
lmhin.
"S':Ind- the Family Name" pre
sents stage life from a new angle and
approaehe. the ever-interesting sub
ject of theatricals in unusual manner.
While it is b, no means a "problem
play," this latest Lois Weber creation
is purposeful and worthy in every
particular. It embodies every pur
pose that Bluebird photoplays have
undertaken to establish and depend
upon for public patronage: a good
play. well acted, appropriately cast,
fittingly produced, accurately equip
ped, and carrying a theme that ap
peals to the better class of theatre
goers.
Dustin Farnum in "David Garrick."
There are few plays on the Ameri
can stage more popular than "David
Garrick." The fame achieved by the
older Sothern in this role is one of the
traditions of the American stage. The
film version, which will be presented
rt the Grand Monday, follows closely
the lines of the play on the speaking
stage. Of the acting of Dustin Far
nom one cannot speak too highly. It
is masterly. Mr. Farnum has a very
fare conception of the character of
the great tragedian and he portrays
aise must also be .given to the
:playing of the rest of the ca"t,='4iota
bly that of Frank Bonn, who giv
an excellent impersonation of "SguC
Chivy." Considerable pains have
been taken by the director in securing
the proper atmosphere and his success
has been complete. The manners,
the dress, the furniture of the pe
riod are reproduced with rare fidelity.
This fact adds very much to the play's
undoubted merits.
The story, which of course is well
known, has stood the test on the
speaking stage and loses none of its
essential merits on the screen.
"Caprice of the Mountains."
"Caprice of the Mountains," which
comes to the Grand Tuesday, is re
viewed as follows by Hanford C. Jud
son in the Motion Picture World:
"The first thing that one must say
about "Caprice of the Mountains" is
that it is really emotional; it gets to
where it sets out to go and carries the
spectator along. This would not be
true if it were not in a large measure
artistic. * , The picture was, we
firmly believe, truly pleasing to the
audience at the Academy of Music,
where we saw the film, on July 11.
" 'Caprice of the Mountains'; we
know what kind of a story to expect
from that title. A backwoods heroine
with straightforward simplicity and
fervent affection, with smiles and
tears carrying a somewhat elemental
but clean love story, and with a happy
ending. in tLs case, June Caprice
smiles an' weeps through the scenes
of the st y, and is acceptable if not
great. Hairy Ilillery is the manly
hero."
"The Innocent Lie."
The Wednesday offering at the
Grand will he "The Innocent Lie," a
five-part story of "Ould Ireland" and
New York produced by the Famous
Players. The leading player is Miss
Valentine Grant, who impersonates
the Irish maid to the life, as she has
seen Irish maids on their native
heath. It is an interesting character
study, and the interest extends to
Nora O'Brian's experiences in New
York-not the least of it being the ef
forts of the untutored Irish girl to ap
pear unconcerned in her surround
ings of luxury. Miss Grant has vivac
ity in generous measure, and, too, she
shows full appreciation of the re
quirements of sterner situations.
Jack Clark is Terry O'Brian, broth
er of Nora. whose enlistment in the
British army impels Nora to seek her
younger brother in America.
The story is competently staged,
especially so the interiors of Nora's
Irish home. The exteriors were
photographed in Bermuda and they
are not only picturesque, but in at
mosphere vividly remind of the land
and shore of the troubled island they
are intended to simulate. The story,
which develops rather slowly, picks
up sharply in the latter part. There
is action aplenty following the arrival
of Nori in New York, where the Irish
girl finds herself the beneficiary of a
mistake in identity. It is this situa
tion, the struggle of conscience to de
clare herself Nora O'Brian and not
Norn Owen, that explains the title of
"The Innocent Lie."
"A Son of the Immortals."
Placing a Yankee upon the throne
to rule as king of an imaginary nation
somewhere in Europe, and the results
ttat come from his democratic rule,
form the basis for the sensational five-
act photoplay, "A Son of the Im
mortals," in which J. Warren Kerr
gan will be seen at the Grand Thurs
day. Of course the politicians of his
realm did not like his unconventional
method of popularizing himself with
the people, and the resulting plots and
counter plots that lead close to an
archy and revolution provide exciting
scenes to stir the enthusiasm of Am
erican audiences to a degree unusual
even in these days of sensationalism
in photoplaying. Great mobs in bat
tles, the exciting incidents attendant
upon plots formed for assassination,
and the final triumph of the dashing
Yankee provide incidents that are
sure to arouse to high pitch the fervor
of photoplay enthusiasts.
"The Tarantula."
In this si:-part offering, which the
Grand announces as its Friday attrac
tion, the Vitagraph company pre
sents a drama of intense emotional
appeal. The cast is largo and evenly
balanced. Edith Storey appears to
advantage as Chonita Alvarado, a Cu
ban beauty. Harry Hollingsworth
plays the role of Teddy Steele, the
young fool from the States, who will
not take advice and ventures too far
with the native belle. Antonio Mo
reno plays the Cuban lover, Eulalie
Jensen the faithful Donna Luz, L.
Roger, Lytton the fiery Senor Alva
rado, and Charles Kent the part of
Van Allen, who narrates the story in
a New York club.
There is a wealth of color and at
mosphere in the production. The
story has momenfs when it threatens
to plunge into melodrama, but the
natural development and forceful act
ing of the competent performers saves
it from this fate. It maintains, as a
result, a high level of intensity and
moves on with attractive smoothness
to the tragic climax in the last reel.
Briefly, the plot concerns a hand
some young American who goes to
Cuba with his uncle on business. He
enters into a flirtation with Chonita
and, despite warnings of her lover
and his own friends, succeeds in
bringing about her ruin. The girl,
cast off by her proud sire, comes to
New York as a cabaret dancer. She
again meets the American and brings
about his death by means of a deadl
tarantula. The close is softened' by
a reconciliation with her father and
- a} rnage -to -aere - -
- T-praductionffas a whole -s one of
exceptional strength, -
"What Happened at 22."
When "What Happened at 22" is
shown on the screen at the Gem next
Tuesday, the audience will be treat
ed to one of the most interesting,
fascinating and unusually original
photoplays ever filmed. It is a mys
tery story written in the best vein of
the well-known Broadway playwright,
Paul Wilstach, and in the -hands of
Director George Irving has been gi
ven a most adeq ate and satisfactory
staging by the Lohman Amusement
Company. It is released on the
World Film program and is bound to
make a big hit when shown in this
city. Frances elson, last seen in
"Human Driftw d," and Arthur Ash
ley, hero of "Se led Lips" and "The
Struggle, as wel as "Tangled Fates,"
will be featured in this mystery play.
"The Dividend."
Chas. Ray and W. H. Thompson
are seen as co tars in "The Divi
dend," Triangle elease which is to
be seen at the Gem next Saturday.
The story deals with a father and
son whose happiness is wrecked by
the greed and selfishness of the elder
man. Before he story opens, his
wife's life has been saddened and
shortened by her husband's coldness
and neglect. The boy, sent away to
school, has grown up without a fath
er's love; nevertheless he still loves
his father, and when the day of his
c;raduation from college comes, he
anxiously looks for "Dad." But there
comes only a telegram of good wishes.
Back in his home the boy wants to
go to work for his father, and make
zomething of himself. But the elder
man is too busy cutting wages, rais
ing rents, and otherwise piling up a
record dividend for the corporation
over whose destinies he presides, to
nay any attention to his boy. He pro
vides him with an allowance, and
tells him to enjoy himself, without
getting in the way.
The boy drifts from a gay life into
one of dissipation, and then into de
pravity. He becomes an opium fiend
and the companion of a girl as hope
Tessly wrecked as himself-a girl sent
into the streets by the grinding pov
erty which the elder man's avaricious
tactics have imposed on her and thou-'
ands of others. Meanwhile the cap
tain of industry has built a mission in
the slums where his son wanders, and
it is his delight to contemplate the
congregations of forlorn humanity
who gather there to hear the gospels
of Christ preached by his eloquent
nastor-in-charge.
There comes a final day of reckon
ing, when the corporation has paid its
record dividend, and its president re
ceives another dividend of a different
sort-the (lead body of his son killed
in a slum brawl. The lights of the
mission burn brightly. while the
father kneels besides his boy's limp
Form: and the girl wanders from the
millionaire's door back to the pave
ments where she must find the living
his greed has denied her.
The urgent need of continuing the
ratproofing work of the United States
public health service in New Orleans
is emphasized by the capture of six
plague-infected rats in that city be
tween July 18 and August 16.

"The Sorrows of Love."
"The Sorrows of Love," an ab
corbingly interesting% Triangle-Ince
feature in which I B6`sie Barriscale
land William Desqondwill appear at
the Gem Theatre tonight, is of Italian
locale, and Miss Barriscale has the
part of Sister Beatrice, who is first
seen as "The Lily" in the convent of
St. Cecile. The plot concerns mainly
her adventures in the outer world,
after she has fled from the convent,
believing she can find a greater mis
sion outside its walls. How she meets
and falls in love with a young labor
agitator, only to meet tragedy and
return again to the convent, has been
ab::orbingly depicted.
In the role of Beatrice, Miss Barri
sc.le is credited with a remarkable
characterization. Her delineation of
the white-robed nun is the very es
sence of innate goodness, while her
later portrayal of the passionate
daughter of Italy is equally rich in
fiery emotion.
Norma Talmadge in "Going Straight"
In "Going Straight," a Triangle
drama starring Norma Talmadge, to
be seen at the Gem Sunday, Jimmie
Briggs, a crook, recognizes in John
Remington, a respectable and pros
perous real estate man, his former
partner in crime, Higgins, who is
now going straight. Remington and
Grace, his wife, who formerly aided
in criminal work, have reformed be
cause of their children.
Briggs blackmails Remington until
the latter has no more money to give
ipjn;; and then, under threat of ex
ý-posure of Grace as a past accomiplice,
he persuades Re ington to assist
to .sae her, he agrees. Grace, un
aware of what her husband is doing
for her sake, has gone to the home
of a wealthy woman friend to spend
the week-end, the very house, it hap
pens, that Briggs has selected to
burgle.
In due course Remington and
Briggs jimmy a window open and en
ter. The former tackles the safe as in
former days, while Briggs goes up
stairs to take what loose jewelry he
can. When Remington starts up
stairs after Briggs he is horrified to
see him struggling with his wife, who
has heard the intruder. Knowing on
ly that Grace is in danger, he strikes
Briggs over the head and knocks him
to the floor unconscious.
Meanwhile the other guests have
been aroused, so Remington's escape
is cut off. Grace has presence of
mind, however, and, "planting" Rem
ington's mask and gun on Briggs,
tells the people that her husband felt
she was in danger, followed her to
the house and arrived just in. time to
save her from the burglar, Briggs.
Unfortunately, Briggs escapes in the
confusion; and his desire to be re
venged on the Remingtons, who have
double-crossed him, leads the play to
a thrilling finish.

AN IMPORTANT CONVENTION.
Bayou Lafourche Parishes Vitally na.
terested in Waterway Project.
The Assumption Pioneer, in its is
sue of Sept. 23, calls attention to the
approaching convention of the Inter
state Inland Waterway League, and
stresses the importance of sending a
good delegation to the meeting from
the parishes of Ascension and As
sumption, which are both vitally in
terested in the successful completion
of the waterway projected by the lea
gue. Says the Pioneer:
'The convention of the Inland Wa
terway League, which organization
proposes completing the inland canal
from Brownsville, Texas, to Donald
sonville, La., thereby connecting the
Rio Grande and Mississippi rivers, will
be held in the hustling city of Lake
¶harles the third week in October.
his convention is one of vital import
ance to Assumption as well as to ad
joining parishes. The successful car
rying out of this inland canal will give
us advantages of water transporta
tion which cannot be overestimated.
For that reason we ought to take prop
er steps so that we w4 be repre
sented.
"The inland can-p; which touches
the richest sections of Texas, will give
south Louisiana direct water commu
ication with them. It will mean the
placing within the arms of the city of
New Orleans a business feeder richer
than any she has today. It will bring
about a business all along our interior
and isolated points, that will be of
vast benefit to both Louisiana and
Texas.
"The United States government has
contributed large amounts for the
building of this canal, and will no
doubt finance its completion. There is
no transportation that would be safer
and surer in case of hostilities with
an enemy than our inland canals. Ap
preciating its importance under all
circumstances, the United States has
given liberally to such projects.
"Let Assumption and Ascension,
and the parishes of Lafourche, St.
Mary and Terrebonne, see to it that
a strong delegation from this part of
the state is sent to Lake Charles. All
of these parishes are on the eve of be
ing united by gravel roads, and with
the completion of a project such as
the inland waterway, there will be
no end to business improvements.
"The more transportation facilities
a community has, the better equipped
it.- to handle all kinds of new busi
ness. The biggest handicap to the
interior Lafourche and Teche section
if Louisiana is the fact that it has not
sufficient transportation facilities.
With an inland canal such as is being
completed, dirgt-communication wit"
be giyen the: : td A na-of
mean bi~ggeroportun ice fo e*er
body, and is sure to bring better and
more prosperous times.
"Here is an ideal chance for citi
zens to show their patriotism. Go to
Lake Charles and help those who are
working to get this great project
through. The convention will be at
tended by some of our most promi
nent citizens and by foremost citizens
of Texas. One of the addresses will
be delivered by Senator Joseph E.
Ransdell, who is considered an au
thority on waterways in the United
States."
