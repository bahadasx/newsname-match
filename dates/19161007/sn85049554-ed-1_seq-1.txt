Brooklyn' 5 10 4
Boston 6 8 1
Boston, Oct 7.—A crowd of great
numbers turned out today to Braves
field for the opening game of the
world's series of 1916. Brooklyn, win
ner of the National League pennant,
challenging the supremacy of the
American League, proved* an object of
wide appeal to enthusiasts.
The teams were favored by ideal
weather conditions. The day v/as al
most summerlike, with only a slight
tang of autumn in the air, which
caused some spectators to bring wraps.
There waa wind likely to enter into the
calculations of fielders.
It was in this atmosphere, surcharg
ed with the current of baseball's great
est event, that the crowd gathered and
exchanged gossip of the probabilities
of play.
"Who will pitch for Boston?" was
the biggest question before the time
of play. .Manager Carrigan said his
selection would be iRuth, Shore or
Mays.
Those close to him had Indioate"3
twenty-four hours previously that
Leonard would pitch. The reason for
the latter's elimination did not develop.
For Brooklyn It was thought Marquard
would serve his left handed shoots,
whioh were effective against the Red
Sox In 1912, when he appeared with
the New York Giants.
Lineups Being Shifted.
The Identity of opposing pitchers
was a considerable factor In the com
position of. the lineup of either team,
both M'anager Robinson ant Manager
Carrigan relying upon interchangeable
ontf!eld£"1Eo '"BrinipoUT'ffttdfed strength,
Stengel, a weak batsman against left
handers, has no chance against Ruth
or Leonard. His place will toe taken
by Johnston.
Similarly Walker, center field for
Boston, would be thrown out of com
petition with Marquard in the box, the
recruit Shorten being a more effective
batter against left handed pitching.
Carrigan, it is understood, will have
Hoblltzel play at first base thruout the
series instead of putting in Gainer
against a left handed pitcher.
Umpires are: Connolly (American
League) behind the bat: O.Day (Na
tional League) on the bases Dineeir
(American League) left field Quigley
(National League) right field.
All-Night Crowd Smaller.
The mass of people who swarmed
thru the broad bleachers of Braves
field, chosen as the stage for the local
games because of its great seating ca
pacity, grew rapidly from small groups
who had spent the night at the bleach
er gates. The line was smaller than
had preceded any world's series games
played In this city In recent years.
Some slept, others walked about,
while more eager ones read forecasts
of the game in the morning papers.
Bonfires were lighted to burn off the
morning mists which came off tfhe
Charles river. Later automobile par
ties began to arrive. Out-of-town en
thusiasts poured in by automobiles and
trains.
Standing Room Tickets in Demand.
Space was provided for 45,000 per
sons, thru tfhe erection of a fence
across right field from the smaller
stand to the wall. Standing space in
right field sold at 50 cents, a prlqe so'
low that the gates were jammed at an
early hour.
Reservations, however, had been vir
tually sold out hours ahead. So gre%£
was the demand that could not be sat
isfied, some of it from friends of club
officials and players, that President J.
J. Lannin, of the Red Sox, increased an
earlier offer of a premium of |1 a
ticket for an offer of )5 above-. the
ticket's face value. It was reported
that he was able to buy back only a
ferw.
The players did not hurry to" the
field. The Brooklyn club members
spent the forenoon about their hotel.
All appeared to be in good condition.
"We realize that we are up against
a big proposition In the Red Sox, but 1
know the boys are capable of It. Of
course, we expect to win," said Man
ager Robinson.
For Manager Carrigan, of the Red
Sox, this, world's series marks the end
of hip baseball fcareer, if he adheres to
a dqgislon to b« reiterated in a day or
two. Today he did not wish to discuss
the matter.
Largest Crowd on Record.'
The two contestants for the premier
honors In baseball engaged In the first
game of the world's series before what
apparently was the largest crowd that
ever looked on a battle of bats. Some
42,000 or more spectators filled every
seat In the stands and then -over
flowed Into a larger sp&ce, temporarily
aranged for standers In* deep right
field. Speculators reaped the proverb
ial harvest and then a'little more on
grandstand tickets. 1.
An Indian summer sun turned the
edge of What early threatened to be a
brisk, cool autumn day, and noon found
It warm arid comfortable. The play
era warmed Into condition quickly and
'jam
the fielding workouts were snappy and
fait. The playing fields were rolled
smooth while the paths were in fine
shape. A brass band piped its snap
piest airs near the home folks trench
"We hope to uncover some real
baseball, today," said Manager Carri
gan, of the Boston Americans.
"We have the players, the Incentive,
the big prize in baseball und plenty of
opposition from the" other fellows."
Applaua«^For Brooklyn.
Brooklyn cam£ on tho flild while
Boston was at batting practice. They
werfc given a big hand by the crowds
and Manager Robinson led his men to
the visitors' bench. Jack Coombs and
Ivan OlPon, old American Leaguer,
came In for quite a reception from
friends on the Boston club.
Brooklyn wore their gray traveling
uniforms, with black and gray stock
ings. The Red Sox wore white uni
forms and red and white stockings.
Manager Carrigan and Captain Jack
Barry, ofttlmes during batting prac
tice, called the Red Sox strategy boa^rd
and conferred down at second base.
During Brooklyn's batting practice
"Duster" Jlaily, a left hander, served
up the benders, Manager Robinson
evidently figuring that his club would
be confronted by "Dutch" Leonard or
"Babe" Ruth. Then Smith, another left
hander, was sent out^ to pitch to
Brooklyn. While these preliminaries
were being run, a fleet of photogra
phers cruised about snapshooting field
ers in batting practice.

Secretary of Postal Clerks
Demands Wilson Be
Consistent
SAYS BURLESON
IGNORES STATUTE
Flaherty Telia President Employes of
Government Fail to Get Juatioe Under
Statute Long in Existence—Employes
of Postoffice Worked Nine, Ten and
Even Twelve Hours Officials Indif
ferent to Plight of Workers.
Washington, Oct. 7.—A challenge to
President Wilson to prove the sincerity
of his statement that he favors an eight
hour day was Issued from the American
Federation of Labor building here by
Thomas F. Flaherty, secretary of the
National Federation of Postoffice
Clerks,
Mr. Flaherty called the president's
attention to Postmaster General Burle
son's disregard of the eight hour law
for postal employes, particularly in the
•Chicago postoffice, and demanded that
he take steps at once to have the law
enforced.
Open Letter to Wilson.
In a letter to the president Mr. Fla
herty called attention to the fact that
in the Sixty-second congress a law was
passed providing that postoffice clerks
should not be worked longer that eight
hours a day within a period of ten, and
that in cases of overtime they shall be
given pro rata pay.
"This law," said Flaherty, "contem
plated that only In emergencies should
more than eight hours be requested.
Yet in many of the large postoffices,
notably New York, Chicago, Boston,
Cleveland, etc., the clerks are forced to
work ten, eleven, and even twelve
hours.
"You very happily expressed yourself
on this subject in a recent speech, say
ing, 'We believe in the eight hour law
becav.se a man does better work within
eight hours than he does within a more
extended day.' These words have a
direct application to a postoffice mail
distributor. He works mostly at night
at top speed, at high tension, perform
ing an important work requiring con
stant vigilance."
Points Chicago Record.
In the Chicago postoffice alone Mr.
Flaherty pointed out 800 clerks have
averaged I'M hours overtime during tho
first six montbe^f. this y^r. .T£ev-bulk
of .this was crowded into 'lite last four
months of that period.
"Since July," he continued, "the con
ditions have grown steadily worse, un
til at the present time, with the pre
election and the usual heavy fall mail
ings in full swing, thousands of clerks
are complaining of their hardships.
"The responsible department officials
are seemingly indifferent to the plight
of the workers. The remedy is within
their hands to apply If they "so desire.
(Postmasters are clamoring for help, the
clerks are longing for relief, and yet the
department officials refuse to recog
nize the need of keeping the working
force recruited to an efficient working
standard."
Mowrey took Lewis' grounder and
touched Walker as he came Into third.
One run, two hits, no errors.

Spencer, Oct 7.—The report of the
special temperance committee of the
Northwest Iowa iM. E. Conference waa
presented by Dr. Robert Smylle, who
moved Its adoption. The reaolution
was presented at the morning session
after the dispatch of some regular bus- I
lness. It was thought, by some that
the report would not be presented until
the afternoon session. Dr. C. E. Clinch
of Oregon, representing the Church
Temperance soolety, had been Intro
duced to represent Ms work.
Following his address Dr. Smylle
presented the report of the committee
and moved its adoption. C. E. Chapter
Debate Is Heated.
A
protested against the mention of the
name of tho democratic candidate, B.
T. iMeredltih. The debate had not pro- "J
gressed far when it became very evl
dent that Mr. Chapler did not have the
sympathy of tne conference with him.
There were a number Of calls for the
question. Tho conference demanded,
however, that he be permitted to make
his speech.
He moved an amendment that alt Jg
reference to B. T. Meredith be left out •,-.
of the report. Robert Smylle followed Jp
with a ringing speech that will be re- W
membered long jears by the members
of the conference. He Insisted that
the .Methodist church waa not an ad
Junct of the republican party and that S
the conference resented any attempt to
hold It In line »s such that we must
be permitted 'the right of voting our *|g
convictions, as that right was claimed
by the liquor Interests. Mr. Smylle
reminded the conference that he waa «. .v
a stan-dpat republican, that he voted
for Taft amid many cries of 'Wear",
"HeaT", but that when It came to
question of'aligning so directly •wlth!f*s
the liquor Interests as voting for Har
ding, he for ono -would vote for Were*
dith this fall. A/ motion was made to
lay' th* 'amondrrfent strikjpg- ottf thf
name of ®. T. [Meredith A the table*
This motion was put and carried over*
whelmingly. "4'
Resolutions Adopted.
The main question was then put ad*
opting the. report of the committer
and carri«d amid great enthusiasm^:
The resolutions on temperance are:

litis state the outcome of which ma^
seriously hamper the cause of prohibit
tlon, not only in Iowa but nattoarwtdet

"Whereas, the right of the church to

Whereas, There has been ample op
portunity for a dispassionate consider

Hon. W. L. Harding, republican candi

has seen fit to say for publication In
his own defense.
"Therefore, Bo It resolved. By the
Northwest Iowa Canference of the
Methodist Episcopal church. In confer
ence assembled, Oct 7, 1916, at Spencer,
Iowa: First, that we calmly but firm
ly stand on our rights as men and cit
izens and affirm that wo are proceeding
along the safe and sane lines that public
agitation against the liquor traffic haa
been conducted for tho last fifty years,
practically the only lines open for ua
to exnress ourselves in a deliberate way
on questions affecting public morale, we
denounco the attempt to gag the church
and deprive us of the right of fr«6
speech and reirind those that are 00 out
of harmony with the bulwarks of our
civilization, a free press and free
speech, that silence at such time as
this would be treason to the cause of
prohibition and would Inevitably be.
construed Into consent that the saloon
should again be enthroned In our state.
"Second: It is plain that the Hon.
W. L. Harding in the general assembly
and as lieutenant governor was so con
sistent or persistent and continuous In
his hostility to efficient temperance leg
lslatton that In our judgment doubt as
to where he stands has no reasonable
basis. Nor has he said anything In this
campaign utterances which indicates in I
the smallest measure any change of
heart. Plainly In the judgment of those
who would reinstate the saloon he has
and deserves their confidence which,
notwithstanding ail he has said on the p-,
platforms of the state. Is unshaken and gfev
unshakable. They were for him in the
primary regardless of the party Itaee
uiiu Uiey or« for him now. Vfe note 5533^ '".
the fact that all attempts to disguise ..
a in a Is 7
the wets has been abandoned. s
"Third: We disclaim any personal
animus or conscious prejudice and de
clare that our objective Is as it always
has been, the complete and absolute de
struction of tho liquor traffic for bev
erage purposes. Then why should he at
a time like this haggle about party reg
ularity when a vote for Harding Is a
vote to encourage, the bootlegger or
call back the saloon, or both, and will'
be so interpreted. While the public po
sition taken by the Hon. E. T. Mere
dith is favorable to statewide prohibi
tion. -n ~-3
