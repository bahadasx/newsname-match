lloston, October 6 This city, the
home of winning world's series base
ball teams, awaits the opening ot the
Vjlti classic tomorrow, between tha
Itrookljn Nationals and the Huston
Americans, with the calm confidence
that comes from I'altli in Hh 1 :
representatives and the unbroken
string of victories In past contests.
The optimism and fighting spirit that
the Brooklyn luh and its accompany
ing baud of Supporters brought to
town tonight added interest to the im
pending struggle for the premier
honors of the diamond, without shak
ing in the least the faith of the local
fuus that the Ked Sox would triumph
over the invading team from Greater
New York.
Tills confidence is reflect ed in a
score of ways and in every portion oi
the city as well as throughout MM
Copland. In baseball debate and
wagering it crops out time und time
again until It would appear as if there
was not in all of this section one
American League rooter, who even
COMsMtMi the possibility of defeat
While the betting tonight Is 10 to 7
on the Red Sox, with but little Brook
lyn money In sight, the average sup
porter of the lloston Americans, de
spite his confidence, is far from pre
dicting a walk-over for the winners of
the American League race.

The Hepubllcan Campaign Commit
tee of I-ouisvllle has supplied Mays
vllie and Mason county with another
Republican speaker. I'nlted States
Senator Warren O. Harding of Ohio
will address the voters In the Court-,
house on Monday, October 16.
The Republican party Is making
great efforts to carry Kentucky this,
fall and to this end they are putting
the best speakers possible into the
campaign In this state. And Kentucky j
li rallying to hear bucIi orators as
Morrow, Harding, Borah mid many
others of the noted speakers of the
country.
Senator Harding has been recog
nized for the past several years as one
of the great statesmen of the country.
In 1912 he presented the name of
President Taft before the Republican
Convention in Chicago for re-olectioi.
by that party. At the last convention
he was elected temporary chairman
as such sounded the key note for the
1916 campaign and later permanent
chairman and for some time was con
sidered as a possible nominee by the
G. O. I, being one of the "favorite
sons." Since the nomination of Hughes
as standard bearer for the Republic!:. i
party he has taken the stump tor the
candidate and it is counted as one of
the real big man In the country
W herever he has spoken he has not
failed to present his convictions iu a
very clear manner and to doubt lews
convince many of the futility or voting
for the re-election of 'resident Wil
son. Kvery Republican and voter In th
county should be present to hear Sen
ator Harding. The address will be
held in the evening and all will have
an opportunity to come and hear him.
Although he has never spoken In
this city before, be will un
doubtedly draw a very large crowd as
his reputation as a speaker is nation
wide. Following Hon. Edwin P, Mor
row he will keep the Republican cause
trash In the minds of the people. Oth
er speakers may possibly be secured
beforo the election but they will be
announced later. Special seats re
served for the ladies at the speaking
of Senator Harding.
