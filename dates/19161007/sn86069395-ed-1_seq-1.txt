Very Important Bus- .
mess.
The City Commissioners met Tues
day and the principal business was
the repeal of the ordinance placing a
25 cent license on each hogshead of
prized tobacco. Under the revised
ordinance the loose floors will pay a
yearlyiax of $50 and storage houses
will pay $25.
Theorizing houses will pay a tax
according to the number of hogsheads
they prize as follows: 300 hhds. or
less prized during the year, $25; 300
nKfiohhris. nrized. $50: 500 to 750
hhds. prized, $75; above -750 hhds.,
$100.
One of the street rollers was rent
ed to the officials of Montgomery
county, Tenn., at the rate of $50 per
month for so long as they .care to
use it, or they have an option to buy
it at any time for $1,000.
An order was also passed to enlarge
the city building by building two walls
to the present building, which would
give the commissioners and the police
department more room.

THE BLIND
SENATOR
0( Oklahoma, Senator Thos.
P. Gore, Coming Tues
day, Oct. 10.
Tb SPEAK FOR WILSON
Famous Western Orator Who
Has Never Before Visit
ed Hopkinsville.
United States Senator Thomas P.
Gore, of Oklahoma, will speak in
Hopkinsville the afternoon of Tues
day, October 10, m the interest of
President Wilson. Representative
David H. Kincheloe will also be heard,
according to announcement made at
the state headquarters, by Chairman
Arthur B. Rouse, of the State Speak
er's Bureau. Oklahoma's blind solon
is regarded as one of the ablest speak
ers in the country and Chairman
Rouse endeavored to get him for a
number of speeches in Kentucky, but
he was notified by the Western head
quarters at Chicago that prior engage
ments prevented Senator Gore from
spending more' than one day in the
State.
Due to the fact that the Oklahoma
statesman will be forced to leave the
State the samejjight on which hois
scheduled to spfeatf in Hopkinsville, it
will be necessary for him to begin his
sneech at 1 o'clock that afternoon in
order for him to make train connec
tions for Louisville and get to his ap
pointment the followirtg day.
Campaign Chairman Vego ' Barnes
is making preparations for a big
crowd to hear Senator Gore. If the
crowd is large enough to overflow
the circuit court room, the Tabernacle
will be used.
This will be the first visit of the I
distinguished blind Senator to Hop
kinsville and perhaps the first speech
he has ever made in Kentucky.
He will undoubtedly be greeted by
a great crowd.

The first stop was made at Hern
don where the Glee Club made some
music and a short talk was made by
Chas. M. Meacham.
A quick run was'made to Bennetts-
town where a big bunch of children
fand several men and ladies were
present. The orator at this stop was
L. E. Foster. Of course there was
music by the band.
At Lafayette a stop of half an hour
was made and speeches were made
by R. E. Foster, W. R. Howell and
Chas. M. Meacham.
The next run was to Weaver s
Store where H. H. Abernathy, W. R.
Howell and C. R. Clark all made short
talks.
It was a rough trip of six miles to
Bumpus Mills, through some deep
hollows and over steep hills but the
party arrived on time at 11 o'clock
and their stay of two and a half hours
was the crowning feature of the trip.

ate. The local hotel was run by a
little landlady who lost her head when
she saw 70 hungry men clamoring
for something to eat. She had plenty
to eat, great hot roasts, pots of beans,
turnip greens and potatoes, a big pot
of coffee and a whole sideboard filled
with stacks of delicious pies. The
boosters took charge and soon turned
her food into money, until both pock
ets of her apron were running over.
C. L. Tyler and Nick Doumas install
ed themselves as chefs, designated
Guy Starling, Guy Champion, Sam
Ficken, C. V. Utley and Ernest Hig
gins as waiters, and for an hour kept
things moving in regnlar Hopkins-,
ville style. The little lady's food held '
out, with her busy efforts to replen-'
ish, and by one o'clock everybody
was feeling good and some of the
orators could haardly be restrained
from making after dinner speeches.
But a new stunt was pulled off here
and some of the local people, blush-
ing and protesting that they couldn't
speak, were hoisted into the auto and
after a little warming up did them-'
selves proud. G. L. Pace, W. B.
Burke and W. B. Pugh, each in turn,
made fine talks. They told how glad j
they were to have Hopkinsville send
such a delegation down to their little
town to ask them to sell their prod-
ucts, and they gave assurances that
the visit would bear rich fruit. The
local orators were given three cheers
1 -l t lU 'TT
and elected members of the "Ken
tucky and Tennessee Booster's Asso
ciation," as Claud Clark called it.
Just before the crowd took a reluct
ant departure, the pretty little school
teacher had the children to sing this
improvised chorus
Who did come?

Who did come to Bumpus Mills?
Bumpus, Bumpus,

The W. C. T. U. Women and the

a called meeting Wednesday after
noon at the Carnegie Library Mr. J.

present in the interest of the prohibi

and Guy Champion starring. The
spellbinders were R. E. Cooper, F.
K. Yost, J. O. Cook, C. R. Clark, L.
E. Foster and W. R. Howell.
! Foster told a new joke about a lit
Ue brtue who knew how to paint but
couldn't sew and when she had fall-
-1 ... 2 -.11 L 1 lU 1
en down in nn attempt to patch her
husband's trousers tearfully gave it
up and said she couldn't patch but
could paint a rose over the hole. The
joke made such a howling hit that
Foster told it at his next burst of
oratory.
At Parkersburg where there was
one store and a school house Chas,
M. Meacham talked to half a dozen
men and a yard full of children, and
aroused their curiosity about the big
things to be seen in Hopkinsville,
Only a brief stop was made at Cli-
nard's, with no speeches.
At Rose Hill the crowd was small,
about 20 or more, and R. E. Cooper
attempted to speak from a box in
front of the only store, but the dis
tribution of souvenirs broke up his
crowd and when he found nobody
left on the porch but Jake Senseny,
one of his regular customerslvJind
coop of chickens, he quit and told the
joke on himself, telling Mr. Senseny
that he would tell him the rest the
next time he came to town.
At Spry's Store a nice little crowd
was on hSnd and a stop was made
long enough for Foster to tell his art
joke.
j The next stop was at Howell, where
the party arrived just before dark
and found Kay Fleming's barbecued
sheep waiting for them. It took
about 30 minutes for the hungry
boosters to surround the savory mut
ton, cooked in Kay's superb style
that iii body m this region has ever
been known to equal. Then short
talks were made by Abernathy,
I MeacL.m and Clark and the run to
1 Hopkinsville was made by 7 p. in.
This is a brief resume of the happen-
e.t- i I--- l i ,
ins ui uie rweive nuurs uuu eiapseu
from the start to the finish. It is the
universal opinion that the trip will be
productive of great good. No one
was allowed to boost his own busi
ness, except by distributing literature
and souvenirs. All of the speakers
boosted the wholesale interests of the
city and at every place told the peo
ple to patronize their own merchants,
but sell their products in Hopkins
ville, where they would find a cash
market for everything they had to
sell.
The orators were all at their best .
and everybody stood the trip well.
J. A. Fink, who looked after all

promptly repaired all machines that
needed it and if one got stuck his

the dust, nothing marred the nlcas-

London, Oct 6. With the Russians:
still vigorously attacking the Austro-
Germans in Volhynia, west of Lntak
and thence along the whole front to
the Dniester in Galicia, Emperor Wil

Ausfro-Germans have been defeated.
RUMANIAN INVASION ENDED
Although there is some divergence
in the official reports from Sofw and
Bucharest concerning the fate of the
force of Rumanians which was thrown
across the Danube into Bulgaria, the
fact is plain, according to a Bucharest
communication, that they have ceared
their "demonstration." Bucharest
adds that the Rumanians withdrew to
the left bank of the Danube but Sofia
asserts that the battlefield in north
Bulgaria between Rustchukand Turt
kukai where they crossed the river,
is covered with Rumanian dead . vt
result of their forced speedy retire
ment back to their own soil.
All the attempts of the Rutr..T?ns
and Russians to advance in Dobrudja
have been frustrated by counter at
tacks of the Teutonic allies. Thirteen
cannons have fallen into the hands ot
the Russians and Rumanians in this
region.
In Transylvania the Rumanians have
captured near Parajad, Austro-Ger-man
fortifications after a battle that
lasted three days.
CLOSE IN ON MONASTIR.
Forces of the entente powers have
driven their line to within twelve
miles of Monastir, Serbia, and occu
pied the town of Buf. On the eastern
part of the Macedonia front the occu

Berlin. Likewise, Berlin concedes
the taking by the entente forces of
