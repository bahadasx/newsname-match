W0H GREAT VICTORY;
In Good Clesn Game of Foot Ball Cal
vert Is Defeated by a Score of
13 to 0 Boys Entertained. -
The Allen Academy boys more than
sustained the schools reputation for
prowess In athletics yesterday after
noon by defeating the Calvert High
School bunch by a score of IS to 0.
This score does not tell half the story
As matters have ran In the past
Allen would not consider this much
of a victory for Calvert has never
been considered a formidable rival In
football. But this year they were
reported to have an nnusual team of
veteran men- They have been In
training during the summer and have
played two games piling np big scores
against their opponents The Allen
team Is composed mainly of new and
untried men and this was to be their
very .first game of the season. Cal
vert came upon the field confident
of victory, according to the 'state
ments of their supporters. The Allen
boys only knew the reputation they
bad to sustain, and they knew their
own Indomitable determination o
fight for their colors to the last ditch.
The first score wss msde In the
third quarter by a forward pass from
Poljtfosse to Griffith, who made a
great catch In the end sone. DeLafosse
kicked goal The eecona score was
made In the last quarter by Dodglns
splitting the line for ten yard gain
and. the goal, this goal was missed
The Allen boys line held like a stono
wall and time after time the Calvert
team hit them only to lose ground.
Captain DeLaPosse at quarter showed
remarkable genoralshlp and his work
was the .feature of the game- Griffin
at right end, Halter at Half and Dog
gins at Pull were also good factors
In the game.
In the matter of entertainment
Cajvert did herself proud- The prin
cipal of the Academy and the boys
are alike In their expressions of ap
preciation of the splendid reception
accorded them. The Calvert people
certainly have the social graces and
they know how to display them- To
begin with a strong commit t re of
promlnpiit buolness men composed
largely of old Allen boys, motored t )
tlrysn several days ago and extended
a cordial and pressing Invitation to
the principals to bring the entire
