goodness and satisfaction it offers. It is made by
a patented process that removes bite and parch!
You can smoke it long and hard without a come

answers the universal demand for tobacco
without bite, parch or kick-back!

than to walk into the nearest place that sells
tobacco and ask for "a supply of P. A " You pay

WHY
Y O l
Should Attend
J
LEG
SPENCER BUSINESS COI
Because men now travel on wings talk by lightniu
annihilate both time and space, by means of the telephone, {
and require 100 per cent efficiency in their employes.
Because a thorough business education, with shorthand
and typewriting gives the great es guarantee of success.
You must make a LIVING- whether you want tool not.
The right kind of a business education gives the surest
means of acquiring the former, and the easiest way to make
the latter.
Because its faculty greets its audience each morning with j
interest so vital, purposes so useful, originality so varied,
ideas so new, fresh and bountiful, that each day's work is;
a performance possible only to .-uch co-operative forces. j
Because the methods employed in both the Commercial
and Shorthand departments are simple, easy, fascinating,
and the time required to master them is about one-half the
time it takes to half-way master the old systems.
Because we conduct a Free Employment department
and have an experienced man to devote his time to that
work alone.
