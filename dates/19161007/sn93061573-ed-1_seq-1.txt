A. A. Jones, nominee for 1. S ,
senator, was the ...acotid speaker,
being introiliireil hy tiie Hon. l'u
V: Iwr.le. '"ite lurui' crowd expected
a big speech liy a tiii man, anil
was not disappointed. Mr. Jones'
address was a masterly present- ,
i ui'iit of tin' accomplishments of t
the present ailminisLralioii, and a '
Big Ainericai. plea for tin: reelt'c-,
ion of a Big American I'rcsident,
Woolrow Wilson. Mr. . I ones did not
ill fend flic record of President Wil
son and tin1 congress, saying thai
il needed !IO defense; In; .-imply cll
I. "ge, upon its greatness, pointing!
out the great benefits to tlie coun
try of the Federal llesere art, the
llura! Credits art, the C.layloii anti
trust art, the I'mlerwood bill, tlie
.-v'anians bill, the Child l.ahoi' law.
Hie Anderson Light Hour law. ami
many others, everyone of which!
were proposed and enacted into
law on the personal reroinmonila
lion of the president, und in the in
terest of tlie great majority. Mr.
Jones is easily tlie lirst citizen of
New Mexico, and will be elected to
represent the state iu the 1'. S.
senate by our unpreredent major
ity. Then came Hon. Antonio l.urreo,
Hie pleasing silver-tongued oral r,
and rt'ticient secretary of stale.
Mr. Lucero devoted bis, address al
most entirely to the state ticket, and
to the accomplishments of the Mc
Donald, administration
out thill the democrats were in pos
i'ssioii of only the executive depart
ment of the state gov eminent, and
the republicans iu practical con
trol of both the judicial and leg
islative departments, having secur
ed two-thirds majority control of
the latter, through the instrument
ality of the, "jimmy". Union coun
ty know all about the "jimmy."
Besides tli3 unanswerable argu
ments advanced by the speakcrs.Uio
pleasing gentlemanly manner in
which they spoke of their oppon
ents and those who disagree with
Hum in political belief, won them
many friends. This was brought
prominently to the attention of the
audience by remembering the bloody
.shirt, bitterly partisan and really
ungentlemanly uddress made by J.
Wight Giddings, the night before.
One republican summed up the dif
ference between gentlemen who had
.something to say, and a hired man
who had to earn his Ilubbell check.
Editor Busenbark of the Report
er at Raton, spent laot Saturday in
Clayton. Mr. Busenbark is the ed
itor and business head of a mighty
good paper. He was greatly pleased
with Clayton, and surprised at our
evident business superiority over
other towns in this section.

platform and invited New Mexico's

Hernandez made an aileinpt, but

l.rrazolo. who was familiar with

Hernandez was not well posted on

showed an ignorance of both and

When interviewed -in r.layluii by
a represent al iv e of the News, Mr.
I :i i s-ii hi, very alfeclively onioned
Lin adiiiliiislrai i e policy w hich lie
will follow, if elected, lo Hie very
important ollice in the following
words:
''Tin- small man is enhtli d lo the
-nine consideration in all public
matt-Ts, as those more fortunate
and should be vixen a:i equal op
portunity to pinchase or lease the
public laud of New Mexico. The
funds derived from the sales or
I ases of the public lands belong to
the people of New Mexico, and not
tu any person or political party
and i-hould be producing interest
in an amount sullicienl to partiy
pay, if not . entirely rare for the
expense of the administration.
'The stale land fund ;s now in
excess of S7(Hl,ono and 1 cm informed
by o. N. Marrón, Stat" Treasurer,
that there has never been paid, one
penny on the amount, as handled
by my opponent. Mr. I'.rx ien. This
! -p r i -- i- i'ii deposit in various banks
i'1 th" slate: you have some of it
Ii i" u Clayton, and while I lirm'iy
believe that il should be deslribot
id throlllioi:! Ill-' state I bell"Ve
Dial it should be -o handled as to
produce a return, in the way of in
terest, thereby allowing the money
of the citizens to earn something
toward defraying the expenses of
their government.
"I inn informed, and I believe
correctly, that the expenses of the
state land ollice for the year 1913
were in c.xcqss of $30,000, which
I believe to be rather expensive ad
ministration iu view of the small
number of persons who were suc
cessful in securing leases or in the
purchase of state lands.
"As I stated before and your peo
ple, Saturday night, I promise and
wi I give them an economical ad
ministration if elected to this office
and I not only invito but will ap
preciate the very closest possible
investigation as to my ability and
past administration of public ofllce,
and am willing to be judged by
that record.
"I ask and seek the support of
every citizen of New Mexico who be
lieve in honest service and fair
ness to each and every person with
out regard to his financial condition
or political creed."
