Boston - QEDamaaBOH sua
Braves Field, Biston, Oct. 7.—The Boston American's triumphed
over the Brooklyn Nationals in the first game of the world's series
here this afternoon by a score of 6 to 5. The Boston's victory was
threatened in the last inning when Shore weakened and had to be
taken from the box. Over 40,000 persons saw the contest which
was marked by brilliant fielding on the part of the victors and the
weak defense on the part of the Brooklyns.
Marquard started in the box for Brooklyn but his defense com
pletely crumbled in the seventh inning when a couple of errors
and a hit gave Boston three runs and a safe lead. ,

more on grandstand tickets.
Snappy Workouts
An Indian summer sun turned the
edge of what early threatened to be
a brisk cool Autumn day and noon
found it warm and comfortable. The
players in practice warmed into con
dition quickly and the fielding work
outs were snappy and fast.
The Inner and outer playing fields
were rolled smooth while the base
paths were in fine shape. A brass
band piped its liveliest airs down near
the home folks players' bench.
"We hope to uncover some real
baseball to-day," said Manager Car
rlgan, of the Boston Americans. "We
have the players, the incentive, the
big prize in baseball, and plenty of
opposlton from the other fellows."
The Brooklyns came on the field
while the Bostons were at batting
practice. They were given a big hand
by the crowd as Manager Robison
led hta men to the visitors' bench.
Jack Coombs and Ivan Olson, old
American i.eaguers, came in for quite
a reception from friends on the Boston
club. The Brooklyns wore their gray
traveling uniforms with caps to match
and black and gray stockings. The
Red Sox wore white uniforms, white
caps with red and white stockings.
While the batting practice of the
Bostons was on. Manager Carrlgan
and Captain Jack Barry, ofttimes
called the Red Sox strategy board,
conferred down at second base.
Manager Carrlgan while the Brook
lyns woro having their batting prac
tice, took his team tothe clubhouse
where he had a talk with them and
gave his final instructions for the
game.
Shore and Ruth warm-id up for Bos
ton, while Pfeffer, Coombs and Mar
quard worked for Brooklyn.
Small Night I4ne
The mass of people who swarmed
through the broad reaches of Braves
Field chosen as the stage for the
local games because of its tremendous
seating capacity, grew rapidly from
small groups who had spont the night
at the bloeacher gates. The night
lino was smaller than had preceded
any world series game played In this
city in recent years. At daybreak
knots of fifty persons each were gath
ered on the threshold of the park,
awaiting the opening of the gates at
9 o'clock. Some slept, others walked
about, while more eagerly read fore
casts of the game in morning news
papers. Bonfires wore lighted to
burn oft the morning mists which
came off the Charles river.
