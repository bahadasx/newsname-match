Fair Comments.
! The Fair was a real success. The
j men of vision did it in forty days, but
j what will it be by next year when all
j protestors, knockers, grumblers and I
told you so's" have forgotten the past
j and all have become boosters?
Frank Sullivan proved himself to be
I the best hamburger salesman on the
grounds.
The most delightful and restful place
on the ground were the tea rooms con
ducted by the young ladies of the Nor
mal. The tea they served and the win
some way they received yoa, added
much to the pleasure of the four won
derfully delightful days. They served
thousands of cups of tea to the people.
Many are-now realizing that the fair
ground is not large enough, and that
some of the buildings will have to be
placed on the south side of the creek.
Such a move will only add to the at
tractiveness' of the ground.
The shout and the noise of the Fair
are past, but the good done will go on
forever.
The stock show was worth while.
Not many county fairs will be able to
show such bulls as those owned by C.
G. Cochran.
Mr. Jerry Fellers made a rs .-class
Stock Superintendent. He was there
on his job, a good judge of stock, and
insisted on all getting a square deal.
Lindsey Clark, a Normal student who
is feeding pigs in order to pay his way
through college, entered , some of his
porkers and had the good .fortune to
take a number of prizes. You carnal
ways count on this boy bringing things
to pass.
The Methodist Ladies had their usual
good luck and cleared a nice sum of
money. These women know how to
win when it comes to feeding crowds.
The only failure at the Fair was the
man who said he could fly. The only
thing that he could do was, every little
while start up his engine, cause his ma
chine to make an ear-splitting noise
the noise was only a bluff then settle
down for a fairer day. The fly-man
was a failure.
The most costly thing on the ground
was electricity.
Thursday and Friday were the big
days. More money was spent on Fri
day on the ground, than any ether day.
There are some things that come to
Hays, worth while. Mike Quint, the
well known chicken fancier, had a hen
so perfect that the poultry judge re
fused to place markings. He said there
was not a chicken m the state its equal.
Mike will enter the bird in the poultry
display in Kansas City and New York.
The Standing Grain Thresher attract
ed more attention than any machinery
t display made at the fair. Men are
more and more convinced that this ma
chine is to do the work for them in the
future. A crowd was always there list
ening to Mr. Hartman and Mr. Stevens,
representatives of the cdmpany, ex
plain the machine. All know that Mr.
Lew Kraus is the agent for the ma
chine in this county, and that Mr. II.
H. Pierce is the agent for Russell coun
ty. Mr. Kraus and Mr. Pierce drove to
Nebraska, to watch the machine do the
work there. They came back highly
pleased. It is truly a great experience
to realize that you are taking a part in
' revolutionizing a grert industry. Just
to know that in ten years the present
mode of harvesting will be called "an
cient" is startling to contemplate.
Y" "Oh, how beautiful!' was the ex
clamation of nearly everyone when en
tering the fair grounds, on looking at
! the upper story of the Normal building,
which wa3 the open front of one of the
most attractive rest rooms the mind of
man could conceive for an occasion like
this. There filling the lower part of
the arched front, were huge boxes filled
with beautiful growing vines and flow
ers. This feature was the work of the
agricultural department of the Normal.
Miss Schoenhals has proved herself
to be a woman of great insightto the
needs of the people of the rural dis
tricts. She had plotted a design of an
ideal rural community that surely look
ed good to the crowds that constantly
surrounded her department in the-Normal
building. Many helpful hints were
offered to the people that can easily be
put into practice. No doubt this com
munity center suggestion put out by
Miss "Schoenhals, will readjust the con
ditions that now exist in many rural
communities.
That bunch of Normal girls and boys
who met evenings in the Methodist
church kitchen during the week preced
ing the Fair, and made four hundred
j pounds of candy, had no difficulty in dis
J posing of every "bit of it at good profit,
the money to be used to defray the ex
penses of the Reveille for 1917.
Speaking of candy, why not include
confectionary in the culinary depart
ment another year?
One of the most remarkably suggest
ive exhibits seen at the Fair, was the
wheat display by the Experiment Sta
tion under the direction of Superintend
ent Weeks. Any man i who "-stops to
study the showing made and then goes
home and grows wheat the "same old
way'-' that he learned from his fathers,
is beyond educational redemption.
Not many Stata college presidents
have grown big enough to suggest, di
rect, enthuse and personally labor for
a County Fair and all the benefits that
come to the people therefrom, as has
President W. A. Lewis, LL. D-, of our
Normal school. He is a big man alid is
not afraid that his bigness will shrink
by touching hands with the masses.
Owing to the absence of Secretary
P. J. Deane who :s attending the siock
show at Kansas City this week, we. are
unable to g-ve a report of the fair, as
to premiums, etc., but if possible will
have a complete report next week.

ihe IjUIi, i lainviile &. .Northern was
begun reveral 3Tears ago, but owing to
frte failure of the construction com
pany backing it "t tint time, the pro
position was abandoned just after the
grade was ready for the rails. Inter
ested parties kept the enterprise alive
by paying taxes in hopes some other
company would take hold of the pro
ject and put it through.
Announcement today is to the effect
that this is about to be accomplished
by the Imperial concern, which states
actual track-laying will begin no later
than November 1.
The new road will run from Holy
rood, Kansas, through Ellsworth coun
ty to Hays, so that connections may be
made with the Union Pacific. There is
a possibility the road will build north
from Hays, into Nebraska.

ready for operation April 1, 1917, when
rolling stock and other equipment will
be purchased.

School Attendance.
To Parents:
The importance of regular attendance
of children at school should be empha
sized. The amount of school work to
be accomplished in a term is based up
on the whole number of days school is
in session and it is not to be presumed
that pupils can accomplish standard
work in less time. Absence always
means a los3 to the pupil. He not only
misses the days lesson but is seriously
handicapped in the advance work. The
school course is continuous, each diy's
work being based upon and presuppos
ing the previous day's work.
Pupils should not be kept out of school
except in case of sickness or abso'.ute
necessity. Outside work, visits, plea
sure trips, etc., should be so arranged
as not to interfere with school attend
ance. Absence means not only a less
in school work but minimizes the im
portance and seriousness of school
work and tends to cultivate the habit
of shirking. The pupil should feel that
it is his business to be in school every
day during the session unless unavoid
ably kept out. He should learn earl
fn life to stick to his job. .
. Hereafter, in the Hays Public schools,
excuses for avoidable absence will not
be accepted and pupils absent without
good reason will run the risk of being
failed at the end of the month or term.
This aDulies to all frrades. including thn !
High school. C. A. Shively, Supt.
