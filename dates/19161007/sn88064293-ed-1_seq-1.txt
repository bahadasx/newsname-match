Support Efforts of Citizens
I he first meeting of New Or
leans business men to devise ways
and means for completion of the In
tercoastal canal from Morgan City
to New Orleans was held Friday
afternoon in the library of the Asso
ciation of Commerce, Major Janies
L*. Wright presiding, according to
the Times Pieayune.
After several addresses, upon mo
tion of S. A. Trufant, the chairman
of the meeting was instructed to ap
point, a committee whose duty will
be to outline a plan of organization
for an association auxiliary to the
Interstate Highway League, the
chief aim of which will be to work
for the extension of the canal to
New Orleans. The following commit
tee was appointed: S. A. Trufant,
chairman; E* L. Chappius, II. II Har
vey, George A. Hero, F. N. Snell and
M. L. Alexander. The committee was
called to meet at the Association of
Commerce at I I o'clock, Saturday
morning.
Walter Parker, secretary of the
Association of Commerce, called the
meeting to orilcr*and stated its pur
pose was t:> arouse city-wide inter
est in the Intercoastal canal project.
He deplored the fact that New Or
leans Inn) been slow to show its in
terest in the work of completing the
link between Morgan City and New
Orleans. Mr Parker introduced Ma
jor James L Wright as the chairman
of the meeting
Major Wright warmly commend
ed the moment to begin work in
earnest for the extension of the can
al eastward. He emphasized the fact
that the Louisiana citizens who here
tofore had worked in the interest of
the canal were not, and are not now
under salary, and that what they had
accomplished was done through the
highest patriotic motives. Mr.Wright
called upon Leon Locke, who for
many years has been interested in
the waterways of Louisiana and es
pecially the completion of the Inter
coastal canal, to address the meet
ing.
Among other things Mr. Locke
said that sooner or later the canal
would be completed to New Or
leans, but that without concerted ac
tion on the part of the business men

To the Insuring Public
The trouble and expenses incur
red by the Local Insurance Agents,
because of their inability to collect
their prejgiiums, and the frequent
losses by non-payments has—become
so much of a tax on their business
that they have found it necessary to
limit all credit for premiums to 60
days from date of policy. Hereafter,
satisfactory settlement must be made
within that time, otherwise the policy
will be cancelled, for such non-pay
ment. , N
Morgan City Underwriters Association
had scored three runs off Marquard
in the 7th ,
A great 9th inning rally by Brook- !
!yn scored four runs. In this inning

of New Orleans it would take years
to complete the work. The time was
; now ripe, Mr. Locks said, for New
I Orleans interests to impress Cong
I ress with the need of the completion
jof the waterway which would mean
i much to New Orleans. Heretofore,
; the speaker said, individual indorse
ment had been given the project to
»complete the stretch between Mor
gan City and New Orleans, and no
I man had worked harder to bring
about this desired end than Mayor
^ Behrman, but the action nmm need
ed was that representatives of the
various exchanges and the leading
business men of New Orleans band
themselves together in an organiza
tion with the sole aim of completing
the Intcrcoastal. Mr. Loeke said that
! when the improvement in the Trinity
i river in Texas was completed, and
j when the link between Morgan City
j and New Orleans was completed, it
j would be possible to reach Dallas,
I Texas, by an all- water route. He
thanked those present for the inter
est they had shown by their attend
ance upon the meeting.
Congressman Dupre said he had
been over the "route of the proposed
link from Morgan City to New Or- i
leans and he was fully conversant
with what its completion meant to
this city. He considered that stretch j
of the canal between Morgan City
and New Orleans as the most impor
tant to be traversed, saying the can
al would never be a complete suc
cess until it reached the river. The
people of No*v Orleans could depend
upon him and his colleagues in Con
gress to do all in their power to
; bring about the completion of this
important link in the project.
