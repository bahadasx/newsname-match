to amend and supersede it, where
the'

to
ever any of its provisions jscfire^jji
conflict with the amending act.
But if the amendment- now be
fore the people is rejected at the
approaching November election,
the effect will be disastrous upon
» certain class of pensioners, as
was shown in "An Appeal For
Ratification of The Pension
'Amendment," to which reference
is made bv our correspondent. In
the happening of such an un
looked for and unexpected con
tingencv. as the rejection of the
present amendment, there will
still be the sum of $550,000.00, eol
lected annually from the one mill

under the amendment of 1914,
which as has been shown, will sfill
be operative.
But such amount, as was shown
in the article referred to, is inad
equate. even for the navment of a
monthly pension of $#.00, to 5#42
pensioners. There are also 365
on the "waiting list," whose
claims have been approved, but
who cannot bo paid, because of
the insufficiency of funds. It is
the insufficiency of funds. It
natural to assume that this "wait
ing list" will -be increased from
time to time, by the approval of
taiore claims, at each quarterly
meeting of the Board of Pension
Commissioners.
The present amendment has
been submitted to rectify this un
fortunate condition of pension af
fairs, by the appropriation of the
entire proceeds of the one mill tax
for such purpose, and its rejec
tion at the November election
would in the nature of a dire ca
lamity to all pensioners, not only
to those who are now the recip
ients of its imited bounty, but
also to those who are waiting
natiently and resignedly in the
bone and expectation that it will
come to them later on.
Hence, it is easilv inferable,
that an adverse vote against the
pension amendment in November,
will leave pension matters in statu
ono. Those now drawing pen
sions will continue to receive the
same amounts. But those now on
the "waiting list," and others
yet to come after them, will
entirely bereft of all hope for
