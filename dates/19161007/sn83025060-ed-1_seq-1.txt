Authentic Proof That Americans In
Peril Were Deserted by Their Own
Government Against tiie Protests of
the Senior Naval Officer Present
Most Pusillanimous Episode in the
Naval Annals of Our Country.
Theodore lloosevelt In a letter to
Henry Keuterdahl, the naval critic,
criticises PrcMdent Wll-oii and Si civ
tary Daniels In connection with tli
Tamplco affair, when the Auwrlcaii
warships were withdrawn by order oi
the Administration. The eetsucl ays:
"You have presented authentic proof
of how the Amei leans In peril at
Tamplco were deserted by their own
government against the protest of the
senior American naval olllcer presiut.
You have shown that the government
at Washington had full knowledge of
the danger of the situation through
telegrams from Admiral Mayo sent
by wireless to the navy department
on April II, 112 and III. You nl.-.u
give the telegram of Mr. Daniels of
April -0 directing the admiral to pro
ceed to Vein Cruz.
Mayo Feared Loss cf Life.
"You have shown that Admiral
.Mayo made an emphatic protest to
the navy depaitiaeiit, stating tli.it he
feand the result of the mIiihIi-ii s
leaving would be Ihe loss of American J
lives and property. You also ouoto
J he telegrams sent by Admiral Mayo
"he following day, containing the pro
test of the Ameiban consul, Mr.
Miller, and requesting authority to
remain at Tamplco. You have shown
that, nevertheless, tlio navy depart
ment on the 'Jlst cot.llrnied Its previ
ous orders and dlreited the bhlps to
leave at once.
"You hav'j rJtown ihnt the iiiltnlrnl
put out into the ocean eight miles
distant, but received u protest from
Consul Miller reiterating his demand
for protection. You then quote the
telegrams and slgn.ils of Admiral
.Ma.vo, who, In spite of his orders,
nobly ret used to run from tho post
of duty while the lives of American
men, women and children were In
danger."
Can't Hide Behind Daniels.
Of tho President and Secietary
Daniels the colouel writes:
"President Wilson cannot shield him
self behind Mr. Daniels, for Mr. Dan
iels could do ' nothing that the
president does not order or sanction.
When Mr. Daniels' actions have been
brought to the attention of Mr. Wil
son, and are not repudiated by him,
they become Mr. Wilson's; and Mr.
Wilson Is fully n ml cojupletely respon
sible for Mr. Daniels, for all that
he has done and left undone.
"The proof Is absolute that when
Admiral .Mayo was at Tamplco he had
received full knowledge of the rioting
ami of the Imminent danger to Am
eilcan lives; but that, nevertheless,
he t teamed away Into the ocean, and
that the Americans were rescued by
(icrmnp and British ships. This ac
tion constituted so grave an offense
trout the standpoint of national dut.v
and self-respect, that any man re
sponsible for It should be at once
taken out of olllce.
Facts' Mado Public in U. S.
"Shortly thereafter the facts were
made public In the United States. If
Admiral Mayo had been responsible
and had not acted under orders, then
the only proper ccurso for Secretary
Daniels would have been to order hU
Instant court-mat llul, and In such case
the falluro to i!j to would have shifted
the Illume at once from the shoulders
of Admiral Mayo to tho shoulders of
superiors, President Wilson and Secre
tary Daniels.
"Therefore, oven If these telegrams
did not exist, even If there had been
no such orders, or those actually Is
sued by tho secretary of the navy
to Admiral Mayo, nevertheless, his
superiors, Secretary Daniels and
President Wilson, would both have
become fully responsible lor tho
gullly transaction by their acquies
cence therein. They cannot, as they
have sought to do, shift the blame
to the bhouldeis of the admiral."
WILSON CONSISTENT ONLY
IN HIS VACILLATION.
As It Is with "war," iso It In
with "Intervention." President
Wilson has again and again said
be would not "Intervene" in
Mexico. As u matter of fact
he lias Intervened continuously
but as he never fol
lowed any policy of either Inter
vention or nonintervention with
any resolution always ylcldliu.
at the critical moment to soiu.
Imudil chief of whom he became
fearful both his spasms of in
tervention and Ids spasms of
nonintervention have alike been
entirely futile. -From the speech
of Col. Theodore Itoosevelt, de
livered at Lewlston, Maine, In
behalf of Clinrlo8I3. Hughes.
DECLINED TO PERMIT A
SGUADKON TO DE1FCND
AMERICANS.
At Tamplco there was a gen
eral movement of attack by the
Mexicans on Americans and
other foreigners. Wc had a
squadron of American warships
In the neighborhood. The Wil
son Administration declined to
pcimlt this squadron to be used
to defend the lives of American
men and the honor of American
women, and the commanders of
the German and English ships
at Tamplco had to step In and
perform the task our icprccen
tativc had so buscly abandoned.
At the very time that the Mexi
can mob had surrounded the
building In which the Americans
had taken refuge, and was howl
Ing for their btood, the Ameri
can fleet, In spite of the pro
testa of the American naval
commander, and In accordance
with wireless orders from Wash
ington, was forced to steam out
of the harbor nnd leave the Am"
crlcans to be macsnered by the
Mexicans, or rescued by the
Germans and Enrich. From
the cpeech of Col. Theodore
