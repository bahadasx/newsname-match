FORGET THE CHI
CAGO POST OFFICE
The Chicago Evening Post of Octo
bor 3 printed tho following bitter at
tack on President Wilson, which shows
that the Post, like the civil service re
formers, shuts Its oyes to what is go
ing on nt homo. Tho Post in Its do
slro ta hit tho president forgot that
no change whatever of a partisan na
ture had been made In tho Chicago
poutolllcc. With this fact in view how
ridiculous tho following Post editorial
appears:
"The 'Snivel' 8ervlce.
"As n sort of uudortono to tho ma
jor music which rolls out at frequent
Intervals across tho pleasant spaces
of Shadow l.uwn tho utterances of
Vice President Marshall are interest
ing. ".Mr. Marshall lacks tho oleganco of
speech that is so charming u charoc
teiistle of his chieftain's oratory, and,
by tho some token, ho cannot as graco
fully conceal his .real thoughts.
"Thus, spooking In his homoly Hoos
lor loshlou to n meeting of his fellow
citizens nt Terro Haute, Mr. Marshall
sold;
" 'Wo found the ofllcos woll guarded
by 'bhIvoI sorvlco,' nnd our only rogrot
Is that wo couldn't pry more of tho
appointees loose and till their placos
with Democrats, ir thero Is any ollico
under thu government that a Democrat
ran't fill I hollevo that ollico should bo
abolished.'
"Now, we cannot Imagine these
words coming from the lips of Wood
row Wilson, although thero Is reason
to bollovo they express a point of
viow with which ho Is not wholly un
sympathetic. Hut Mr. Wilson would
hovo dressed tho simple policy of
porty expediency and spoils In all tho
verbal pomp nnd pageantry of on ox
altod principle.
"Mr. Marshall Is nn Interpreter. Ho
makes tho elusive eloquonco of tho
whlto house understandable to com
mon puoplo. Ho gives tho phantas
magoric movies of Shadow Lawn palp
uhlo substance for tho Democratic
rank mid file. Tone Hnuto, whoro
politics Is of thu most practical type,
finds llttlo It can grasp with satisfac
tion In tho brilliant coruscations from
tho balcony of tho presidential man
sion; hut when 'Tom' conies to town
nnd talks to tho boys about tho 'snivel
sorvlco' thoy reollzo that, In splto of
all the high-sounding phrases eman
ating from latitudes farther north, tho
Democratic party romolns truo to Its
fundamental principles of tho 'loaves
and fishes,' Thoy are given to under
stand that It thoro is any way of got-
ting nround, undor, over or through
tho 'snivel sorvlco,' that way will bo
discovered, and good Democrats will
come Into their just dosorts."

Mr. McGUlen read the platform to

light In its behalf it might havo failed
of adoption In Its present strong and
vigorous form.
