Thousands of Fans From All Over Country Overrun "The
Hub" City, Sleeping on Billiard Tables, in Mad Desire
to Witness Opening Classic Marquard to Hurl for
Brooklyn, Leonard for Boston Red Sox.
BOSTON. Oct. 6. This city awaits the opening of the 1916 classic to
morrow between the Brooklyn Nationals and the Boston Americans with
the confidence that comes from faith in its playing representatives and the
unbroken string of victories in past contests. The optimism and betting
spirt that the Brooklyn club and its accompanying band of supporters
brought to town today added interest to the impending struggle for the pre
mier honors or the diamond, without' shaking in the least the faith of the
local fans that the Red Sox would tri umph over the invadfng team.
Bets Favor Red Sox
This confidence is reflected in every portion of Boston as well as
throuehout New England. In baseball debate and wagering it crops out
time and again. 1 While the betting to night is 10 to 7 on Boston with but
little Erooklyn money in sight, the average supporter of the Boston Am
ericans is far from expecting a walkover. The courage of the struggle put
up by the Brooklyns in winning the National League championship has
aroused great respect for the prowess of the National League standard
bearers and it is conceded that they will give Boston the stiffest kind of
a battle. ' , -
Eye Of Nation On Game .
- The series which opens at Braves Field tomorrow is far from being a
sectional affair, iowever, from the standpoint of interest Notwithstanding
that the contending teams are eastern clubs, the interest in the coming
struggle for the world's championship is national and this is clearly demon
strated by the gathering of the specta tors for the two games that will be
played here tomorrow and Monday. While it is only natural that the ma
jority of the fans should hail from New England and New York, the fact
remains that hundreds of baseball en thusiasts from all parts of the coun
try are here.
Th usands Throng City
Every hotel in the city is thronged
with baseball followers who are will
ins to endure inconveniences, provid
ed they are assured a place to sleep
and eat. A glance at the registers
shows that the fans have journeyed
from the south, far west, central and
Atlantic states to witness the play.
Weather Ideal .-- ;
The weather man has promised his
finest brand of weather for the open
ing game, his prediction calling for
an ideal mid-autumn day and with
little if any wind. Hundreds of men
and boys gathered outside the wall of
the park for an all nieht vigil, under
brilliant moonlight and In a warm at
mosphere that made overcoats and
heavy wraps unnecessary.
The gates leading to the unreserved
sections of the stands and bleachers
will be opened early tomorrow morn
ing and it was apparent that these
sections would be tilled hours before
the game begins at 2 p. m.
Record Breaking Crowd
With the exception of a few uncall
ed for allotments, every reserved seat
was sold out tonight and these will be
manned up immediately when they
are put on sale at the box office tomor
row morning. So great has been the
demand for seats that not many are
offered for sale by speculators. Presi
dent J. J. Lannln of the Boston club
stated that he had been forced to buy
back at a Trmi!. gonip tickets that
he needed for personal friends who
had apnlied and could not be refused
at the last minute.
Speculators Profit
Those speculators who were fortu
nate enoueh to secure even a pair of
seats reaped a profit of more than 100
percent npon their investment on
their mere announcement that they
had seats for sale.
Final Touch Done
There was the usual preliminary
activity of.nlayers and officials during
the dav and the few minor details left
unfinished at the national commission
meeting in New York last Tuesday
wero cleared away. Soon after presi
dents Ban Johnson of the American
Leaetie and John Tenner of the Na
tional league arrived from New York
the positions of the umpires for the
oopning game were assigned and the
annnuncepent made that infield rules
of the two Ipaeues would be observed
under American League regulations
when the club were playing at the

When the members of the Mexican

To add to the heat of the local con

j managed to free himself from the
ropes with which he was tied and pro
cured the revolver from his guard
and killed him. Perry made his way
to a ranch house from which he tele
phoned. The message was garbled,
however, and its source could not be
determined before communication
failed. Sheriff J. F. Frye organized a
posse and is said to have found Perry
unharmed In Twenty Mile Park. One
of the kidnappers was said to have
been captured there and taken to
Steamboat Springs.

Labor Erred In
Forcing 8-Hour
Law, Says Taft
Former President, in Talk at
Indianapolis, Also Infers
Wilson Supported Bill for
Political Profit
(By Review Leased Wire.)
INDIANAPOLIS, Oct 6. The eight
hour law recently enacted by Congress
was attacked by William H. Taft to
night when he addressed thousands of
persons at the Coliseum, discussing
the development of the constitutional
government of the state. Mr. Taft's
speech was a part of the county lay
program in connection with Indiana's
centennial celebration and while non
political gave him an Opportunity to
find flaws in the government's couise
of action without naming persons and
parties specifically.
Mr. Taft declared that the law for
bids the formation of combinations
for oppression, but be said, there has
been devised in this country a tenden
cy in high quarters to disregard con
stitutional limitations and to over
look certain classes of acts provided
a political advantage could be gained.
He regarded the eight hour law as
such and said:
"This is the most noteworthy in
stance of a group whose labor was
necessary that society may live, re
fusing to perform its function in the
social life."

Washington Firmly Doubts
Gerard Is Coming On Such
Mission Many Think Mili
tary Peace Alone Will Do.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Oct 6. Ranking of
ficials of the state department said to
day they had no information to in
dicate that Ambassador Gerard is
bringing home a request from Germany
that the United States intercede t'J
end the European war. and are not in
clined to believe the the stories. Count
von Bernstorff. the German ambassa
dor, declared he knew possitlvely that
it was untrue.
While the department does not be
lieve Mr. Gerard would accept so im
portant a mission without notifying
his government, it is realized that
available means of communication be
tween Washington and Berlin are
very hazardous where the delicate
subjects are involved. The ambassa
dor, it Is felt, might be especially re
luctant to attempt to communicate
with the department with a matter as
important as this owing to the risk
that his messages might fall into un
authorized hands.
Officials at the department today
said that only a specific request for
mediation by one of the belligerents
would bring about any effort by this
country to effect a European peace.
In the absence of Secretary Lansing,
who is ill at his home, high officials
of the department said even if a direct
offer were to come from one side
doubt was expressed whether a will
ingness to receive mediation would
have to come from both sides before
any step would be taken.
There is a growing conviction that
a military peace brought about would
be the probable outcome of the war.
