ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
The rugged Ajo mountains, a
few miles west ot Fronteras and
about 20 miles south of Douglas,
are now the home of several
bands of cattle and horse thieves,
terming themselves patriots, but
affiliated with no Mexican party,
according to news reachintr here.
They have been rather active of
late, so much so that Colonel A.
Praijo.commanding Agua Prieta,
has sent out troop patrols to
drive them from the mountains.

A very promising mining prop
erty is that of the Elephant
group of six copper claims with
mill and smelter sites, located
one and one-half miles west ol
Patagonia, alongside the main
wagon road. The vein has an
easterly-westerly trend, is from
25 to 60 feet wide of iron oxide
liberally impregnated with mal
achite assaying as high as 5 per
cent copper and $10 ia silver.
Considerable ore was shipped
from this property in 1902 by
Wm . Powers and A. Stockton.

Miss M. E. Leverich, one of
the most prominent land attor
neys of the southwest, will re
tire from a business she has con
ducted for 15 years. She was
with the Arizona land office in
Tucson and followed it to Phoe
nix, where she established the
firm of M. E. Leverich & Co.,
which has bandied 350. (XX) acres
of scrip, as well as hundreds of
regular filings. The interest of
Miss Leverich in the business
she established has been taken
up by John H. Page, once terri
torial secretary of Arizona.
Arizona's revenue from auto
mobile and other motor vehicle
licenses for the year 1916 will be
approximately 80,000 according
to figure made public at the
office of Secretary of State Sid
ney P. Osborn. Up to Septem
ber 1, the states receipts from
the sate of auto licenses, motor
cycle license tags, etc, was $69,
253.60. For July the revenue
derived from this business was
$2889 and for August $2306. At
this rate it is estimafed that the
total receipts for the year will
be near the $80,000 mark. Cop

Coyotes are becoming so nervy
these days they come right into
town to visit us. Tuesday night
they made their way to the home
of Mrs. Elizabeth Lindsay, who
lives in the south suburbs of
Snowflake, and purloined two
chickens. The afternoon of the
following day Mrs. Lindsay saw
two coyotes in the close proxim
ity of her residence. Early in
the year several reported losses
of young chickens from these
animals. The rabbit crop and
other varmints coyotes prey up
on must be very short this year.

Carl Smith, one of the pros
perous valley ranchmen, has
contracted his cotton seed at
$26 per ton, and will have about
$4,500 worth at this figure. Two
years ago, before the gin and oil
mill facilities were brought to
the very doors of the valley
people, cotton seed sold at about
$9 per ton. The price of seed
to them this year will be the
means of greatly enhancing the
value of the cotton crop, and
means the development of the
industry to its fullest capacity.
The crop of cotton in the valley
this season proves that there is
no better place in the United
States in which to grow the pro
duct. Yuma Sun.
Hundreds of ancient relics of
intense archaeological interest
have been recoverd from the
cliff dwellings of the Aztecs and
Navajos in Nitsie and Segia can
yons on the Navajo reservations
by Prof. Malcolm Cummings of
the state university, who has
just returned after three months
exploration. Baskets woven from
the Yueca leaf, estimated to be
at least. 1,000 years old, and native
cotton cloth and knit garments,
with crude spindles are among
the relics that are being added
to the Archaeological museum at
the stale university as a result
of the expedition. Over 100 re
lics were brought to the surface
by excavations conducted by
Prof. Cummings and three stud
ents who accompanied him on
the expeditions.
A carload of new machinery
arrived in Patagonia this week
to be used by the Supervisors in
future road work. The ship
ment included scrapers, level
ers, blacksmith tools, etc. Work
on the Nogales Patagonia road
from the Sorrells place is ex
pected to start about the 1st.
The first work on the road at
this point will be changing the
old road out of the canyon and
moving, it back on the mesa.
Work will commence' in both
directious from this place, to
wards the river and towards Pa
tagonia. As work progresses
the road camp will be moved,
the next camp will probably be
at Bloxton, and then Patagonia.
W. C. Travis will be in charge
of the camps, as overseer for
the county. Patagonian.
GOV. HUNT WADES GIL0 RIVER.
"I understand that my oppo
nent, Tom Campbell, has been
creating quite a bit of dust about
the state lately," said Governor
Hunt, "but if the people of the
state could have seen me Satur
day night wading the Gila river
at Florence, with the major por
tion of my clothes on my head,
they would have been of the un
animous opinion that I was creat
ing quite a ripple."
The governor was in his usual
genial mood Monday afternoon,
and referred to his unpleasant
experience at Florence, with at
smile of forbearance. He seem
ed tc realize- that it is not every
day in the week that a governor
of a sovereign state of the union
can be seen wading around in
a river, and although he did not
express a desire to have a pict
ure of the event taken, he
thought that if his supporters
could have witnessed the feat,
they would have been convinced
that he was big enough to raise
the elevation of the Gila several
inches.
Saturday night, the governor
in company with M. P. Jordan
of Gilbert, H. F. Russell of
Glendale, C. R. Knutzen and M.
T. Weyant left in the state car
driven by Harry Shea, for Flor
ence where the governor wished
to inspect the bridge across the
Gila. The approach to that
structure has been washed out
so many times that he wanted to
see with his own eyes how con
ditions were.
That he found out the true
state of conditions, the governor
is ready to swear.
The big state car plunged into
the river the bridge being hors
de combat and got about half
way across. The engine stalled.
There wasn't a team in sight and
it was a question of waiting all
night or getting out and wading.
The governor set the example,
stripped off what clothes he
thought would get wet and
plunged into the chilly water.
The rest of the party followed
him in undress uniform. When
the other side of the river was
reached the chilly breeze struck
them much to their discomfort,
but the prison car took them to
the penitentiary where full dress
was again the order of the day.
According to the governor he
discovered the next morning
that the river was not so big but
that at night it looked two miles
wide. Republican.

Pharao Turned 'em Loose; So Did
President Wilson.
The following is an extract
from a speeh made to a bunch
of Paris negroes by a local color
ed democrat at the depot Satur
day night. He was sitting on &
truck beneath the stars and de
livered himself in this fashion:
" "The Lawd said, 'Pharo, turn
my people loose,' and when he
didn't do it and the Lawd said
again, 'Pharo, turn my people
loose,' and when he didn't do it
the Lawd tuk Pharo down to the
Red Sea and chuck him in. That
Mistah Wilson, he says, Karanzy,
set my niggers free,' and when
he didn't do it that Mr. Wilson,
he say again, 'Karanzy, turn my
niggers loose or I'ze com in' after
'em!' Still he don't do it and
that Mistah Wilson he say,
'Karanzy, turn my niggers loose
bring 'em right home your
sef or thar's goin' to be hell to
pay." An' de' nex' day fo' mil
lion white men with the big dogs
on flat ca's started for Mexico.
You known what happened?
Afore they got there old Kar
anzy done turned them niggers
loose and give 'em a palm beach
suit of clo's an' a bottle of 'male
'apieece, put 'em on a Pullman
ca' and sent 'em home. An' on
the way they met Mistah Wilson,
an' he says, 'Boys, I wuz jus'
comin' to git you ef it tuk every
white man in the Newnited States
t' do ut. No man kin lock my
niggers up 'er pose on 'em an'
cot hear frutu me. Come on an'
get some watermelon.' Ever
hear of a republican doin' any
thing like dat? Naw you din't.
That Mistah Wilson is shonuff
white folks. Republicans aint
got no use fo' a nigger 'cept on

TWO EXCELLENT MEN.
When the State Central Com
mittee selected Geo. J. Stone
man for chairman and T. T.
Powers for secretary it acted
wisely by providing an excel
lent working head for the com
mittee, as on their shoulders will
fall the heavy burden of the
compaign. Mr. Stonemanis well
known in every part of the state
as an able, honest, fair man, of
poise and dignity, who will not
be influenced from any source.
His efforts and desire will be to
elect the ticket in its entirety,
promote harmony and solidar
ity as well as enthusiasm among
his co-workers of the State Cen
tral committee. Mr. Powers is
an honest, able man, well versed
in political affairs of the state.
His service as chairman of the
appropriation committee in the
last house of representative, to
gether with the knowledge he
derived during work in the prim
ary campaign, peculiarly fits him
for the task. Besides he is a
tireless, persistent worker, ac
curate and able to dig up cam
paign data so necessary in this
campaign of education. The
Messenger.
