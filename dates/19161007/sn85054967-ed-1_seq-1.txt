Prisoners Escape From Punx'y Jail
PUNXSUTAWNEY, Oct. s—Several posses are scouring the
country-side today for George Graham, aged 35 years, a prisoner
in the city jail, who last night pounded Jail Warden Andrew Neil,
aged 64, into unconsciousness, and escaped with Rosie Spyers,
aged 15, his alleged accomplice in a series of robberies. Graham
used a shoe as his weapon and the jail corridor where the battle

the Republican organizations of
the Western States for their
weak campaign measures.

Origin of Bon Ton
Fire A Mystery
There have been no develop
ments in .the investigation start
ed today to learn the origin of
the fire which damaged the Bon
Ton store here early Sunday
morning. The fire started short
ly before 3 and when the firemen
reached the store the building is
said to have been burning at
two distinct places. Broken
cash registers, the disappear

[finding nearby of two handbags
belonging to the store indicate
that the interior was visited for
the purpose of securing loot and
fired either accidentally or in
tentionally, as the intruders left.
The loss is estimated at sev
eral thousand dollars. As soon
as the insurance adjusters com
plete their work the storeroom,
which is located on the first floor
of the Elk building, will be re
modeled and restocked.
