PRES. WILSON OF

WASHINGTON, Oct. 7.—Likelihood of the Unit

the warring powers of Europe is dwindling day by day,
according to general belief in official circles here.
The subject is once more receiving diplomatic con

to this country from Berlin, Count Von Bernstorff's
visit to the president at Shadow Lawn next Monday,
and as a result of the president's continued utterances
Pn the subject of world peace for the future.

BRAVES FIELD, BOSTON, Oct. 7.—The Boston Red
Sox took the "jump" game of the 1916 world's series from
Brooklyn today, but it was only by an eyelash. The Red
Sox finished upon the long end of a 6 to 5 score, but a re
markable ninth inning rally by the Dodgers, coupled with
the weakening of Ernie* Shore in the box for Boston, and an
error by Janvrin nearly upset the world's champions.
For five innings Shore and Marquard worked in as pretty
% pitchm;: duel afr on Braves field in some time.

rivals fought it out. Marquard was the first to crack, but
Shore got his in the ninth, when Carl Mays relieved him.
