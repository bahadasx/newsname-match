Now for the fourth lient —(

m»r has whdhiI October, the
tirât autumnal month, is here, und
with it h magic touch is turning
Hie verdure of lield and forests
into glittering tints of gold The
igos (d fruition have succeeded
he buds and flowers that were
and the realization of an abundant
harvest is at hand
From every section comes the
report that business prosprcts are
brighter than they have been in a
decade, and everybody seems to
thuik that this Kail will witness a
revival of commercial activities,
such as has not been seen for
many years. A spirit of good
cheer pervades the country, from
center to circumference, and with
the highest prices for farm pro
ducts America has ever known,
the Old South—"the granary of
the nation"—is at last coming into
her own.
Under the circumstances, there,
fore, it behooves ns individually
and collectively, to shake off the
lethargy that afflicted us during
the dull summer months, and in
the vernacular of the street, "get
iu the push" and win for our
selves a rightful share of the pros
perity that is abroad in the land
Truly, the times are most proplti
ous for a glotious finish to tin
race we have so worthily run thus
far this year, and during the
three remaining months we will
come under the wire on December
Hist, with Hying colors, and with
a recoid, of which each man who
contributed thereto, will feel just

A golden opportunity lies before
us Grasp it! GET BUSY—and

MISS GORDON A
CONSISTENT STATES
RIGHTS ADVOCATE.
a
for
iu
ed
At the recent National Suffrage
Convention, Miss Kate Gordon of
Louisiana was very emphatic in
her stand for woman suffrage by
states rights method. Notwith
standing her very positive advoca
cy, several uewspapers have re
ported her hs endorsing a Federal
Amendment for Votes for Woman
No woman iu the south has stood
so firmly and unalterably fot
Amendments to State Oonstitn
tuns, which will give the vote to
women of every section upon the
same terms now accorded to men
This position of Mis* Gordon
not a recent one, bat has been iter
ated and re-iterated during the
many years of her public utter
ances io behalf of the eufranchise
ment of women Twelve states
have already extended the vote to
their women. This extension has
beru in conformity with the re
qulrements for electors made by
the respective states, and was in
no sense disruptive of Constitn
tional provisions regarding the
ballot. It has meant the mein
elon of the women who could meet
the stipulations for the state's
voters. To report Miss Gordon as
"believing with all my heart in
Federal Amendment for woman
suffrage", is misleading to her
state's rights suffrage companions
and misrepresentative of her con
stancy and integrity in promnlgat
ing states rights southern doc
trine.
What Does
Catarrh Mean?
It means inflammation of a
mucous membrane some
where in the head, throat,
bronchial tubes, stomach, bil
iary ducts or bowels. It always
means stagnant blood — the
blood that is full of impur
ities. Left alone, it extends
until it is followed by indigestion,
colds, congestion or fever. It weakens
the system generally and spreads its
operations until systemic catarrh or
an acute illness is the result.
Périma
Is the nation's reliable remedy for
this condition. It restores appetite,
aids digestion, checks and removes
inflammation, and thus enables the
membranes,through which we breathe
and through which our food is ab
sorbed, to do their work properly.
Forty-four years of success, with thou
sands of testimonials, have established
it as the home remedy—Ever Ready
to-Take. Its record of success
holds a promise for you.

FOUR PRODUCTS
TO CHEMISTS.
Process of Distillation
Is Discovered.
Neattle, Wash., Oct. I — Ex peri
aient» at the University of Wash
ington by Lloyd Davis, of the de
part ment of industrial chemlHtry,
and Dr. W. D Davidson, of the
University of British Columbia,
have resulted in the discovery of
a process of distilling saw mill
waste by means of which tar, a
light oil, acerate of lime and char
coal are obtained.
In the new process the gas pro
duced by distillation is carried
through a pipe nine inches in dia.
meter and 20 feet long. In the
pipe is an electrically charged
wire which causes precipitation of
the heavy articles of tar. The
tar, 40 gallons for each cord of
wood distilled, is of medium con
sistency and immediately market,
able.
The light oil, obtained iu a wa
ter coudeuser, is immediately
marketable tor use iu ore reining
aud the yield is 12 gallous to the
cord of wood. Eighty pounds of
acetate of lime are obtained from
the pyrolignens acid of each cord
of wood. Nine hundred ponuds
of charcoal are the final yield.
When the bowels feel uncomfort
able and you miss the exhilarating
feeling; that always follows a co
pious morning operation, a dose
ol HER MINK will set you right in
a couple of hours. If taken at bed
timo you get its beneficial effect

INEFFICIENT

About the least represent at iv i
land most inefficient bit of govern
mental machineuient is the aver
1 age stale legislalnrc Federal of
ficials and municipal affairs com
maud a much higher quality of
brains in their administration
1 han is discoverable in average
legislal mes. Une legislature spends
finie and money in passing laws
that the next legislature spends
time and money to repeal I'liesi
inefficient statutes affect men and
women who compose the people of
the State. Mere boys in years,
and infants in experience, at*- fie
qucutly noticed in legislative bod
ich, especially iu those states
where the legislative term is short,
and the electorate not of a high
degree of literacy. What a fool,
isli custom which sends these im
mature representatives to enact
laws beyond their comprehension,
and refuses, lug brained women
who would occupy with dignity
and credit positions in the legisla
ture. When the ballot shall ci>wTe
finally to women in the snutjifthr
personnel of many legislative hod

THE CANE CROP.
The cool, elear weather referred
to by ns in our last issne as hav
ing been prevalent for « »me ten
days, bad its continuity broken
during tbe past week by the ad
vent of high summer temperature*
and some scattered showers, the
thermometer on Tbnrsday, the
28th, going up to 90 degrees On
Thursday night, however, a cool
wave of moderate intensity set in
and at this writing it is once more
clear and cool and excellent "rip
ening weather." The condition
of the cane crop is auch, both as
regards advanced condition .
tonnage anticipated, that the mills
are uniformly preparing for an
early start, and every effort
be made to get tbe crop ground

which now seem to be the only

JOHN T. WHITE, Agent
It Always Helps
says Mrs Sylvani* Woods, of Clifton Mills. Ky., In
writing of her experience with Cardui, the woman's
tome. She says further: "Before I began to use
Cardui, my back and head would hurt so bad I
thought the pain would kill me. I was hardly able
to do any of my housework. After taking three bottles
of Cardui, I began to fee! like a new woman. I soon
gained 35 pounds, and now, I do all my housework,
as well as run a big water mill.
I wish every suffering woman would give
CARDUI
The Woman's Tonic
a trial. ! still use Cardui when I feel a little bad,
and It always does me good."
Headache, backache, side ache, nervousness,
tired, worn-out feelings, etc., are sure signs of woman
ly trouble. Signs that you need Cardui, the woman's
tonic. You cannot make a mistake in trying Cardui
for your trouble. It has been helping weak, ailing
women for more than fifty years.
