"AI L R." hae asked me to write

arranged for October 9th at noon,]
when the farmers of Lee, Sumtor and
Clarendon will have an opportunity
to hear Hon. A. F. Lever discuss co?
operative marketing, and the nation?
al legislation that has been enacted to
promote better marketing.
Mr. Ltver by length of service and
constant work for bettering agricul?
tural conditions has risen to the im?
portant post of chairman of the com?
mittee on agriculture of the national
<f representatives. If any

Hem that has been passed, and that
to pesoo* od. to put tho farmers on a
business footing with the rest of the
Industriei of tho country Mr. Lever
Is that man. The court house should
so full to overflowing next Monday to
hear what he has to say. Not only
too formers of the three counties
should/hi there, but the business men
of ssmt?r should he out in force, for
saarketiig hi a business man's prob?
lems eves more so than the farmers
problem, If the business men wish to
solid oi a permanent prosperity for
tho city and county that makes the
city poo able and great.
Thaye is s disposition In some quar

^Minmti for giving special aid
|t is only within the past few years
that agtlcuHure Is being recognised
by the government. And this recog?
nition until very recently has all been
to help the farmer to grow more
that his produce may be cheaper to
the consumer of the country. Legis?
lation and business customs have
seen against agriculture to auch an
eitent that the farms have lost many
ot their beet farm era and all of their
txat laborers who have gone into the
more favored occupations where
wages are higher then farmers pay
and opportunity greater. Men of vis
Ion see that these things must be cor?
rected if this nation Is to remain
great, snd reach to higher Ideale oi
gieatneoH. The bed rock of Its pros?
perity. Its stability, Its true greatness
Is in the soil and quality ot farm*
eta who till the soil. No wondor then
that statesmen are looking for ways
snd means to help the farmer?the
wonder is that they did not see it
long ago?but waited until farmers
began to organise and cry out for .jus?
tice.
Economical and scientific market?

need never fear for lack of produc?

to have a message worth while for

are planning an exhibit of unusual
scope and diversity this year. .
Mr. Baker says he has this year
2,210 boys in the corn and pig clubs
and that he Is urging all who possibly
can gc to attend the State fair. He
Is now engaged In building a magnifi?

ty has organized during the past
two weeks, *
This ante-bellum community of
Plowdcns, DuUunts, Montgomerys,
McPaddens, Witherspoons and Nel?
sons; was always noted for its warm?
hearted simple hospitality, where
guests were mudo to feol at home*
Fox and deer hounds, guns and rods
indicated sport and game in season.
But withal it was a "live at home"
community and Durant hams had a
wide reputation that the present
generation religiously maintains.
That material things old fiot have the
entire attention of these people ssj
shown by several preachers, doctors
and lawyers that attained distinction
In other Heids of luhor who went out
from this sumo one-room school
house or Its less pretentious fore?
runners. One of them, a lady mission?
ary, laid down her life on the altar of
service among tho Kentucky moun?
tains just two years aj.;o and another
was ordained last July for the foreign
field. Miss lieevcs and her brother
Henry Lide lteovcs.
In such an atmosphere the histori?
cal would naturally have a place and
there WAS a case lilled with old fam?
ily heirlooms and a part of the wall
with faded baby dresses of several
generations gone. In another corner of
the room there was a fine, display :?f
field crops and vegetables, corn, sor?
ghum, sugar cane, rice, potatoes,
staple cotton, etc. Another corner
held a large table of jellies preserves,
canned goods, butter, bread, etc. One
ond was k.ng with needle work of
exquisite design and workmanship.
In honor of the occasion both coun?
ty demonstration agents, Mr. Chirk

o, markets which originated in a con?
ference of the president of the South
Carolina State Farmers' Union and
the chairman of the committee of
agriculture, himself a South Carolin?
ian and of this congressional district.
Last week in Columbia under the
auspices of the South Carolina Fnrni
rs' Union the beginning of a cotton
ho' Ikng movement was formally
launched, and a concise comparison
that every one ought to be able to
understand was issued, showing how
inadequate the present seeming high
prices of cotton and cotton seed are
in the light of the enormous world
expasion of money and credits, to say
nothing of the shortness of the cotton
crop and the unprecedented demand
for cotton goods and seed products.
While many people were patting the
farmers on the back and telling them
what a fine price 15 cents and $50.00
a ton are for cotton and cotton seed,
this meeting of farmers dug down to
the root of the matter and showed
conclusively that present prices would
be barely normal with a fifteen or
sixteen million bale crop and that
they are absurdly low for the present
crop, it also warns the farmers that
when this world war ends there will
be a contraction of the currency with
Steadily falling prices until times are
normal again. Every farmer should
know these tlungs and the wise ones
I will not only seek to get his just
share of this vast volume of money
that is being put in circulation, but
will he laying aside some of it for the
era of falling prices that is sure to
follow. I want the Farmers' Union
to get the credit for forcing this mat?
ter to the attention of the people.

FIRES DUE 10 CARELESSNESS
CHIEF BEHRENS CITES SOME OF
THE UNNECESSARY CAUSES
OF DAMAGE BY FIRE.
Mr. I iiii it* ns l Jos peaks Public Cooper?
ation for Fire Prevention Day?
National Per Capita Loss is $5.
News and Courier.
Carelessness costs every man, wo?
man and child in the United States $5
a year was the remarkable statement
made by Chief Louis Behrens, of the
local fire department, yesterday in
commenting on the appropriateness of '
"Fire Prevention Day" to bo observ?
ed In this State and in twenty-eight
other States in the Union October 9.
The day has been set aside and is be?
ing held under the auspices of the
Safety First Federation of America,
Inc.
In speaking of the vast amount of
fire waste in this country annually
Chief Beshrens gave out the following
yesterday:
If you wer? to go to the bank and
draw out all your savings in brand
new bills, and then if you were to take
the money and go and stand in the
middle of the main street of this city
and set lire to the bills, one at a
time, you would find yourself in the
hands of a policeman before you could
say Jack Robinson.
There is no question about the
ownership of the money. It is yours
to do as you please with. You can
spend it foolishly, you can give it
away or you can invest it wisely. But
if you burn it up, it Is immediatly as?
sumed that you are crazy, or at least
temporarily mentally unbalanced, and
the public feels that it has a right to
restrain you.
'Despite this fact we go on serenely
from year to year burning, up our
property without taking the slightest
thought, apparently, of what we are
doing. We erect costly structures and
then sit down and neglect the first
principle of fire preventibn.
Gasoline, which is more deadly than
|||||^
hang our lace curtains close to the
gas Jet and then leave the window
open when we go to bed so that the
i wjnd can blow the lace curtains tnto
the flame.
Statistics for the year 1915 show
better than words the reckless way in
which the American people handle
their property.
There were in 1915 hfl less than 3,
162 individual fires, which in each in?
stance caused an estimated property
damage of more than $10,000.
The total fire doss for the United
States now averages more than $250,
000,000 a year. In 1915 it showed a
slight drop, but there is no reason to
believe that this is more than tempo?
rary, for the lossfes thus far in 1916
indicate that they will be far greater
when the year is completed.
If this $250,000,000 loss were all, It
would certainly be enough, but when
this is said only less than half the
story is told. Besides the burning up
of property, we spend every year In
this country more than $250,000,00vt
for the upkeep of fire departments,
and there is additional waste in the
increased size of insurance premiums
made necessary by our own careless?
ness.
Figure it oat for yourself. There
are 100,000,000 people In the United
States, roughly speaking. The annual
fire tax is $500,000,000.
That means that every man, woman
and child spends $5 a year more to
live because of our national careless?
ness. If the average family consists
of seven, it means that every family
bears a burden of $35 a year because
of the fire waste.
Ignorance of the fire danger is stu?
pendous. It is wilful ignorance, for
in these days there is no reason w hy
anyone should not know, and knowing
there is no reason w hy he should not
have at least rudimentary means ot
protecting himself.
Take your own case, for instance.
Suppose a lire started in your home
tonight while you were asleep. What
means have you at hand to put the
lire out Supposo a lire started this
minute In your home while you are
away. How would it be extinguished
without the help of the city fire de?
partment? Is there an extinguisher in
your house? Is there even a fire pail
or a bucket Of sand? In ninety-nine
cases out of every hundred it is safJ
t<> wager that there is not.
Even negative precautions are not
taken. People permit rubbish to ac?
cumulate In piles in their attic, in
closets, in their cellar.
A pile of papers under the stairs or
in the closet is a first class lire risk.
These places usually are dark, ami

Hartsville, 4.?A destructive
fire, the Iof ^mounting to approxi?
mately $40,0^., occurred here a few
minutes past 2 o'clock this morning.
One of the cotton sheds of the At?
lantic Coast Line Railroad company
and 154 bales of long staple cotton
were destroy as WtWM a nearby ware?
house with about $2,000 worth of
furniture belonging to the Modern
Furniture company fc-'ix box cars, the
property of the railroad, three of
which were loaded with cotton seed
belonging to the Hartsville oil mill,
were damaged and considerable dam?
age was done to a cotton seed house
tilled with seed. In one of the box
cars which was aluost completely de?
stroyed was a Jersey cow consigned
to Mrs. Cox. the \i,due being given as
$60. The animal '*as burned. House?
hold furniture belonging to Dr. F. W.
: Ham was destroyed.
I Computing at $130 a bale the cot?
ton?141 bales belonging to McKln
I non & McNair, merchants here; eight
I bales belonging to C. R. Rouse, repre
, senting Ferguson & Co., two bales the
property, of Hasel & Clark, local buy?
ers, and'12 bales belonging to McCabe
& Co., the total, 163 bales?the cot?
ton loss aggregates $21,000. The seed
loss was heavy but not complete.
Most of the loss, it is understood, Is
covered by insurance, especially as
relates to the cotton.
The Modern Furniture company had
only small insurance. This Is the
most disastrous Are Hartsville has
had in several years.
The lire company was promptly on
the scene and did good work. A stiff
wind was blowing,' but the rain and
the efficient work of the firemen pre?
vented much heavier loss.
Cheraw, Oct. 4.?Yesterday, shortly
after 1 o'clock, Bogan Ingram met
with a fatal accident. He was one of
R. B. Laney's overseers on his plan?
tation about five miles north of Che?
raw, and was running a large self
feeding gin at the time. Some waste
had gathered in some of the teeth,
and he lifted the gin to pull it out,
but unfortunately did not lift it high
enough to put it in safety. He trip?
ped and fell, getting his hand caught
and his hand and arm were pulled in
and cut into sircds up to the
Shoulder. He was immediately put in
an automobile and rushed to Cheraw
for surgical attertion. Though hav?
ing nearly bled to death by the time
he got here, he jdcaded so earnestly
to be taken to a hospital, that, to give
his mind rest, after the necessary
treatment had been given to his arm
he was taken towards I lorence, but
he died on the way. Mr. Ingram had
lost his other arm when a very small
boy through the accidental discharge
of a gun iu his own hands. He was
about 32 years old and unmarried.
He leaves his parents, Mr. and Mrs.
samuel Ingram, who live near Che?
raw, and a number of brothers and
Asters, and a large and prominent
family connection. The funeral ser?
vice was held in the Cheraw. Metho?
dist church at 4 o'clock this after?
noon.
quently results in the match being
dropped or the candle being left be?
hind when the visitor departs. If it is
a closet, the door is shut and soon
there is a bright little fire burning
there.
If the proportion is one careful per?
son to ninety-nine careless persons,
what right have the ninety-nine to
expect the other persons to help them
pay their tire protection? Should not
the careless person be made to pay
for putting out the lire in his home.'
If the tire spreads from ids home to
his neighbor's should he not pay his
neighbor for the loss, where the flu
was due to his own carelessness.
The Idea of peisonal responsibility
is spreading fast. Pennsylvania hn *
passed laws on the subject. The prin?
ciple has boon adopted In New York
city, where the lity has collected
damages In several cases from own?
ers of buildings that have caught
tire. Owners have been compelled to
pay flu? cost of extinguishing the fire.
for the water, the men's salaries, and
(be rental for the apparatus.
One of these days we will wake up
to the feel that lira is a needless
s'aate. The people of Europe have
long ago discovered it.
