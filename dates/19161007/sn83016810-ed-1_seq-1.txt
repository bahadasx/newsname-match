AIR RAID RESULTS
Zeppelins Do Little Harm In
Flights, Say English.
ATTACKS MADE IN DARKNESS.
Figures Show That It HasTaken Mora

Child Who Has Been KilledCasual
ties Steadily Decrease.
London.In the last two years there
have been forty-one Zeppelin raids on
England twenty-three In 1915 and
eighteen In 1910. This summary does
not take Into account the many aero
and sea plane attacks and the numer
ous abortive attempts which have been
been driven back at the coast or
balked by shifting winds and misty
weather.
If In these raids we take three Zep
pelins as the average number and al
low three tons of explosives and incen
diary bombs as the capacity of each
dirigible we have an aggregate of 370
tons of death dealing missiles. Sup
posing each bomb weighs fifty pounds,
we have approximately 15,000 as the
number dropped on England or In the
North sea in the last two years. Of
course it is possible that the German
authorities are the only persons who
know the real figures, but I think the
COUNT ZBPPEJJIN.
rough estimate above is not far wrong,
says Arthur Draper In the New York
Tribune.
The British government has made
public the number of casualties after
each raid, and these aggregate 356
dead and 980 wounded. This means
that it has taken more than a ton of
German bombs for every British man.
woman and child who has been killed.
It is interesting to recall that a mili
tary expert once figured that for every
soldier it killed the enemy must ex
pend his weight in lead. Before the
British perfected their defenses against
air attack the loss of life was much
greater, the casualties steadily decreas
ing as the difficulties of attack in
creased.

Philadelphia.-Dr. James W. Keath,

DEAF MAN IN BATTLE
A HERO UNDER FIRE
Unable to Hear Orders, He Faces
Silent Death Rescuing
Wounded.
London.Some day the stretcher
bearers who are working steadily
throughout the big attack ought to
have a monument all to themselves.
They have already earned It by their
magnificent courage under terrific fire.
One officer of a Manchester "Pals"
regiment which fought at Mametz and
elsewhere is now in a London hospital,
his life saved by the courage of the
men who dashed through a curtain of
fire to his rescue when he fell help
lessly wounded. .-_,- ,_
He says that all the time the stretch
er bearers were doing things which
deserved the distinguished conduct
medal, and he told of at least one man
who he thinks has won it. This is a
man so deaf that he was unfit for work
in the trenches. He was a cheerful
sort, and the men liked the queer
things that happened when he failed
to hear an order.
Every one but the deaf man stood to.
He took no notice.
During the big battle he was ordered
to the clearing station just behind the
lines, but he spent the whole day un
der the murderous fire of the machine
guns and the artillery between the
first line trenches and a shorter trench
far advanced in the most exposed part
of the ground, picking up the wounded,
twisting them on to his broad back
and staggering back with them under
fire until he reached a place of com
parative safety.
Then he went back into the thick of
it again. He was the one man in that
toiling, devoted company who did not
hear the awful clamor of the shells,
but calmly faced a silent death. The
"Pals" whom he has so often amused
are now hoping that he will-get the
medal he deserves.
CRUISER TO CARRY RELIEF.
Des Moines Also Will Take on Ameri
can Refugees at Jaffa.
New York.Felix M. Warburg, chair
man of the joint distribution commit
tee for Jewish war relief, announced
that the United States cruiser Des
Moines would leave soon for Alexan
dria and proceed to Jaffa to transport
the medical supplies sent by the com
mittee for the hospitals in Palestine.
Through the courtesy of the secre
tary of the navy, permission has been
granted for the cruiser to take aboard
at Jaffa the wives and children of
American citizens who desire to leave
the country and come to the United
States. The passage from Jaffa to
Alexandria occupies about thirty-six
hours.
LUCKY COIN TO DAUGHTER.
Governor Pennypaeker Carried It In
Pocket For Fifty-five Years.
Norrlstown, Pa.The will of former
Governor Samuel W. Pennypaeker,
just admitted to probate, distributes an
estate estimated at $20,000 to $50,000
among his widow and children.
One of the odd features of the will
is the clause which leaves to his
daughter, Josephine W. Pennypaeker,
"the silver dollar given me by my
grandmother, which has been in my
pocket wherever I have been and wher
ever I have gone during the last fifty
five years."
This coin, says the testator, "is the
one concrete thing most closely asso
ciated with me personally."

OFFICE BOY NOW MUST
BE A CHAUFFEUR TOO
Business Men Send Youths to Drtvi
Cars Around Block.'
Philadelphia.Requirements for of
fice boys have automatically risen with
the new ordinance regulating the
parking of automobiles in central
streets of this city. Advertisements
for "Boy Wanted" now conclude with
something like this:
"Must be experienced in driving mo
torcars or willing to learn." Here's
the reason:
Suburbanites who drive their cars to
their offices in the city in the morning
cannot leave the autos parked In the
street as they could formerly, in a
section of Chestnut street wjiere there
ate.several big office buildings, for ex
ample, cars must not be left standing
for more than half an hour at a time.
So every half hour the business man
sends his oflSce boy to the street to
drive his auto around the block. If his
office boy isn't a chauffeur the busi
ness man goes himself. But this takes
valuable time, and, added to the ex
pense of starting up the car and mov
ing it around the block sixteen times
a day for six days a week. It costs
money.
Hence the demand for office boys
who are also chauffeurs.
SPORTSMEN PLAN TO WIPE
OUT THE ENGLISH SPARROW
Will Ask Governor of Every State
to Aid In Work.
New York.The League of Ameri
can Sportsmen, whose object is the
preservation of wild life, is consider
ing the question of inaugurating a na
tion wide campaign for the destruction
of the English sparrow. Its officials
say this bird has made such headway
here that it is driving out the smaller
song and Insectivorous birds and that
It has become a question of whether
we will have only the English sparrow
to represent our bird life or destroy it
and regain some fifty species of useful
and beautiful birds that used to in
habit farms and countryside all over
the land.
The league intends to issue a procla
mation declaring war on the English
sparrow and setting aside a week, pos
sibly in April or May of next year, to.
be devoted especially to waging it
The governor of. every, state will be_
asked to aid the work. Printed in
structions as to the plan of the cam
paign will be sent to the mayors of all
incorporated cities and villages, to the
heads of the school systems in every
county, to college presidents, to princi
pals of preparatory schools, to the
heads of the boy scouts in each state
and to other organizations which might
be expected to extend sympathy and
aid.
Four principal methods of action will
be employed: Tearing down the nests,
trapping the birds, shooting them un
der police supervision and under li
censes issued by the police authorities,
and, in cities where water pressure Is
available, turning the hose on the
birds at night after they have gone to
roost.

has transferred to her son, William
Averill Harriman. the Harriman home.
Arden House overtasking the Ram
apo valley, just back of Arden. which
was planned by the financier at the
time of his death.
William Averill Harriman, or W.

known, is the eldest son of the late E.
H. Harriman. He was graduated from
MBS. HABBIMAN AND HBB HON.
Yale in 1913 and married Miss Kitty

Sept. 21, 1915.
Mr. Harriman is twenty-four years
old. Since his marriage he and his
wife have occupied a wing in Arden
House which was added for their oc
cupancy.
Arden House, which is built on a
mountain summit and overlooks the
surrounding country for a great many
miles on the western threshold of the
Hudson highlands, is said to have rep
resented E. H. Harriman's ideal, of
what a country home should be.
Mr. Harriman, himself took an ac
tive interest in the planning of the
house and of the 2,500 acres of park
which surround it. At the time of his
death it was uncompleted, but all final
work was done according to the plans
which be had made.
The total cost of the house and the

Montclair, N. J.Vernon Peterson,
who saved a young woman from

WOULD ALTER "DIXIE."
Musio Teachers Want "Star Spangled
Banrer" Changed Also.
New York.At a conference of high
school music teachers a committee was
appointed to ask music publishers and
the public school teachers to eliminate
negro dialect from songs printed in the
textbooks. Dr. Frank R. Rix. musical
director of the education department,
who was present at the conference,
said:
"My suggestions for these changes
were made some time ago by me to
the board of superintendents, but they
were shelved, and I do not know what
has become of them. The reasons for
changing the darky dialect should
appeal to any interested person. We
want our children to learn pure Eng
lish, not a dialect. Then also there are
many foreign children in our schools.
The number is growing constantly.
Dialect confuses them. It is hard
enough for them to learn our ordinary
English. I think that the change
ought to be made throughout the coun-
try."
In "Star Spangled Banner" "perilous
fight" is to be changed to "clouds of
the fight," and the uniform key will be
changed from flat to A flat to make
the singing of the song easier. In
"Dixie" "de" will be changed to "the"
and "nebber" to "never," among other
things.
KEEPS FISH FROM DROWNING.
Captain Kintz Would Get Medal if
Peroh Had a Carnegie.
New York. Captain Frank Kintz,
master In the Taylor tugboat fleet of
this city, recently became a fish life
saver. Aboard the tug Captain Toby,
Captain Kintz was in Occoquan with a
tow from this city. A yellow perch a
boy had caught had been left dangling
on a string in the water until it was
almost dead, not having strength
enough to hold itself below the sur
face.
Captain Kintz saw the fish and also
his opportunity to save life even if it
was .only that of a fish, and a bony
yellow perch at that. Reasoning that if
it was water that drowned a human be
ing it must be air that drowned a fish,
Captain Kintz proceeded to apply first
aid and help the fish to get rid of the
air. Holding it down in the water, he
gently rubbed its sides, and bubbles of
air rolled to the surface. About fifteen
minutes of this manipulation were nec
essary, and the perch revived and with
a flirt of its tail swam rapidly away.
If there was a Carnegie among the
fish Captain Kintz would surely be
awarded a medal as a fish life saver.
EXPLORES PALACE RUINS.
Pennsylvania Museum Finds Discov
eries of Growing Importance.
Philadelphia.Further excavations in
the palace of Menepthah by the ex
pedition to Egypt of the University of
Pennsylvania museum indicate that
the palace is almost twice as large
as was at first supposed. This makes
it among the greatest palaces of an
cient Egypt, according to Dr. Clarence
S. Fisher, head of the expedition.
On account of the great heat the
excavations temporarily have been dis
continued, but the general outline of
the ruins has been established. Dr.
Fisher has found, in addition to the
throne room where Moses and Aaron
are supposed to have appeared before
Pharoah and demanded.,the release of
the Israelites, many chambers and a
notable vestibule with rows of enor
mous pillars, carved and colored.
Many interesting and valuable relics
which will enrich the university mu
seum have been unearthed.
DEFENDS SIDEWALK SKATING.
Montclair Champion Says It Helps
Children's Morals.
Montclair.The controversy In this
town over the use of the sidewalks,
which was started when "Mrs. John
Haynes Lord protested to the authori
ties because children were allowed to
use them for roller skating, bids fair
to become a community issue.
Mrs. Lord, who was injured by being
run down by a bicyclist on a sidewalk
a few years ago, has many supporters.
Her attitude, however, is resented by
others, chief among whom is Arthur P.
Heyer, who was a candidate for town
commissioner at the last election.
Mr. Heyer came out with another
broadside. He believes that the streets
could be made the greatest educational
asset of any community if the people
would look at the matter in the right
way. He says skating In the open air
makes children moral.

PLAYS STRANGE
PRANK WITH SAILOR
After Crossing Ocean In an Open Boat
He Loses His Life In River
Lorain, O. Ludwig Eisenbraun, a
German sailor, who was drowned here
recently in Black river, was treated
very strangely by fate. Eisenbraun
was the hero of one of the greatest
feats in marine history, achieved when
he crossed the Atlantic ocean in a
nineteen foot dory.
After encountering furious storms at
sea, facing death a score of times in
his frail open boat, he lost his life
when his hand slipped on an icy rope,
which he was using to climb to the
deck of a lake steamer on which he
was a watchman, and fell back into
the river.
On April 11, 1903, Eisenbraun sailed
from Boston harbor in his dory, Co
lumbus II. On Nov. 23 of the same
year he docked his craft at Gibraltar.
Once in a storm his boat was cap
sized, and he lost water and provisions.
He righted the boat, and two days
later was reprovisioned by a British
steamer.
He steered his craft against a sleep
ing whale, and the aroused monster
nearly capsized him.
Eisenbraun had been a sailor on the
great lakes for five years. He was
forty-eight years old.

Double locks, bars, burglar alarms

The crumbling of the dynasty she
attributed to the following:
That people with brains no longer

ers.
That, being a female organization in
the beginning, it would no longer have
cohesion when the little talent it pos
sessed to amuse finds vent in woman
suffrage, club life, business or socio

The younger girls are demanding the
right to select their own mates there

where the men are uninteresting.
That an economic age is fast making
it intolerably ridiculous.
Mrs. Parsons displayed the humorous
deformities of her subject so general
at 'first that her audience, consisting
numerously of "society's" limbs, forgot
to get angry and was soon laughing
heartilyat itself. One or two dowa
gers got fussily up and left with hus
bands, who were red and seemed un

"The society group of any American
community," Mrs. Parsons said, "is
composed of persons sufficiently desir
