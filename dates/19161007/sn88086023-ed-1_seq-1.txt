STOCKMEN IN FAVOR
OF A GAME RESERVE
First Semi-Annual Meeting of Blue
Mountain Cattle anil Honto liaisrrs'
Association ul Alhee.
The first semi-annual meeting of
the Blue Mountain Cattle and Horse
Raisers' Association was held at Al
lien last Saturday with a full list
officers and a large number of mem
bers present. A resolution was in
troduced nnd unanimously approved
favoring the making of the Camas nnd
Hidawny Stock Reserve a National
Game Reserve. President F. T. Pyrd
says the association was very strong
ly in favor of this move ns there was
no spot In the entire eastern Oregon
district at the present time where any
kind of game, with the exception of
elk are protected at nil times of the
year. As the reserve mentioned In
cludes only a very small portion of
'he hunting territory of this section
Mr. Bvrd Is of the opinion that the
hunters will not oppose the plan.
The association decided to begin the
work of building the drift fence as
soon ns possible nnd will advertise for
bids for the construction of same in
the Imvmdlnte future.
The s-cnern! routine business of the
association was transacted, after
which nd Inurnment was In order.

AL, Oct 7. President Wilson

cerning the report that Ambas
sador Gerard is enroute here

als from the German govern
ment. NEW YORK, Oct. 7. Wall

(CARL ACKSflVMAN)
HAGUE, Oct. 7. The Dutch gov-
eminent two months ago sounded the!
European governments on peace pros-
pects. Every belligerent except
France expressed a willingness to en
ter an Informal discussion. France's
reply was such a fiery refusal that one
official said it resembled an ultima
tum. Dutch officials have resumed their
attempt at peace negotiations, but are
convinced pc Is far distant. One
positive indication that rresent peace
is impossible is the wide difference of
opinion between Teutons and allies re
garding the other sides conditions.
Copenhagen is tremendously anti
German and believes Germany will
soon collapse. Copenhagen hears re
ports of unrest, starvation and lack
of soldiers in Germany. Danish and
Dutch people believe the allies offen
sives on the Somme. in Russia. Gali

They can not und rstand why the long
expected German revolution doe not

Tin re is some depression and pessi
mism in Tcrlin but faith in the army
is unshaken. Every German keeps
mans of the battlefronts and closely
watches the firming. The people ;
have an amazing faith In Hinrtenbnrg I
and are great I v interested in Maeuen-
men's Roumanian offensive.
B.-rlln newspapers emphasize the
shortage of British tonnage. They
declare F.nelish food prices were as

resources and the army is weaken-iii-

RECRUITING TO STOP

General Staff Meets Great Difficulty

WASHINGTON. Oct. 7. War Sec
retary Baker is disastlfled with the
national guard recruiting and author
ized commanding officers, to discon
tinue recruiting at their discretion.
This decision is based on the gener
al staff recommendation. Recruiting
is disappointing. The officers met
great difficulty In endeavoring to fill
up militia regiments on the border,
or in training, prepnrurory to going to
the border,
The war department constructed an
extensive recruiting system with. reg.
ular army officers and militia offi
cers, cooperating but admitted the re
sults were far below expectations.
