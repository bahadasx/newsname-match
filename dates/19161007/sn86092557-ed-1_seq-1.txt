Business Growth Says
Dun.
NEW YORK, Oct. 7?R. 0. Don and
o's. Weekly Review of Trade for this
>eek says:
It Is an economic phenomenon that
be highest prices of modern times,
'hfle causing natural hesitancy in certin
quarters, fall to check the growth
f business. Costs In many lines, in
pite of the previous extensive adance,
are still rising steadily and in
orae cases rapidly, yet each week the
lagnltude of demand, continuing after
tonths of unprecedented buying, beomes
more noteworthy.
There is not an industry of any imortance
in which orders, following
tuch less than the customary summer
bandonment, are not again increasig.
and If In some branches the exansion
is limited It is principally beause
of the inability or disincllnaon
of manufacturers to commit themalvcs
further. Nearly all of the works
iroughout the country are covered
y contracts extending well Into the
iture and the chief problem confronttg
producers, as it has been for some
me is the question of making deliv
nes witn tne desired promptness.
Distribution at retail varies with the
'e&ther. but maintains a high averge.
and even in the region where
rop results have been disappointing
onsumption does not appreciably lessn
because of the advanced prices for
irm products compensate for the diilnished
harvests. With the Government
report indicating further deterlortion,
cotton has risen to the highest
