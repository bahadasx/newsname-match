appear a great triutnpn lor V ilia,
according to Imormation before
members of ttM Aiucr.cn u ami
Mexican joint commission.
L'nited Biates secret service a-I

regarded iw a conspiracy ted by
Americana, first, to bring about
the L'nihuahua City Incident, and,
second, to get it exaggerated in
tlie OFFICIAL military reports.
ltb the object i. destroying tiie
the work oi the American ana
Mexican joint commission.
The reports which have been
transmitted by Washington and
Mexico City by tae joint commis
sion CONTRADICT the state
ments of tne account by iug.
Oen. Ceo. lied, Jr. It is regarded
as established by the state de
partment that viila was ntSiiTlMMJ

and that no ammunition was cap
tured and taken olf by the raid
era The sigaal for the rai l, it is b"

or Washington, to the border and
was forwarded by courier to the
bandit organitationa
THE RAID WAS TIMED TOOC

ben the Americans butted iu
to Parrall some mouths ago and
got the worst oi it, the Mexicans
made prisoners of those Ameri
cans that were not killed in bat
tleabout two dozen. These sol
diers were ail colored, except the
commanders.
Of course Uncle Sam couldn't
stand for that. Lynching negroes
at home does not stir our govern
ment to action, but for the Mexi
icans to capture them was differ
ent, it furnished an excuse for
threatening intervention.
So the Washington government
blurted out its ultimatum to Car
ranta to release those negroes in
".4 hours or fight and the uiobil.
zation of troops begau.
Hut Carrania paid no attention
to Wilson's uncalled-for bluff.
Our troops were invaders and
had pro. oked the trouble. They
got tUC WOOTlt of it. With tie ex
ception of a very few who escap
ed, ail of the Americans were ci

However, it looked like war. In

As soon as tne Dogs of War
were temporarily euaiued, Amer

try to adjust the differences be

the approval of President Wilson.
This commission has been iu

Total deposits are now over fifty

the use of this money at - 1-4 p.r

brick venders at Washington
really wanted to do Bomethir.g
for the farmer why didn't they
let 1dm have this money on .the

THAT vLl) ARGUMENT.
One of the stock arguments
against the socialist party is that
it is composed of members from
, 1 the two oid parties and would.
. ! therefore, bscoms as corrupt as
1 the old parties if gien power.
1 It is not denied that tiie old
I parties are rotten to the core.
The fact that they i-e rotten is
unci us proof that from their
I membership no good can come.
i Hut there is a wide difference
in t ho eons ruction of the Social
' ist party and a capitalist party.
The rank and tils, the great muss,
of all parties arc honest and
want eau a ivernraeut, A "da
publican farmer or laborer does
not want bad government any
more than does a Democrat or
Socialist farmer or laborer.
But the basic principle of cap
italism and Socialism are oppo
sites. One is the reverse or the
other. A capitalist government is
one in which the ru:o of property
Is absolute, Property first. Lira
and liberty afterward, v "busU
ness administration," they end it
one In which the bank clear
inns arc great, and Corporate div
idends enormous, w hile the work
