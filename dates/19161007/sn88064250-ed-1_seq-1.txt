BOARD OF STATE AFFAIRS
At a conference in New Orleans
Tuesday, ofposition was disclosed,
as expected, to .the amendment to
the Constitution to be voted for in
Louisiana in November, creating a
Board of State Affairs and regulat
ing the assessment and taxation.
It stands No. 12 among the amend
ments as published by the secre
tary of state.
It s always safe to predict oppo
sition to any legislation which is
aimed to. equalize and, therefore, to
raise assessments which necessa
rily resul, in the raising of taxa
tion on many property owners. It
is true that the objection mainly
comes from those who have been
paying less than their share of the
taxes and- unloading some of the
burden on others. The tax dodger
can be counted on to fight forever
against paying his full share; and
skilled labor.
feat nearly reform aimed at equal
izing assessments.
In New York he late constitu
tional convention submitted to the
voters an amendment not unlike
that proposed in Louisiana, its oh
ject being to give the state greater
power over the assessments and to
put an end to the systen which
prevails in New York as in Louis
iana, whereby the local assessors,
especially in the country parishes,
place property on therwllt a-toml'
a fraction of its true value. It is
the same in. Missouri, and in' a
dozen other states. Equalization is
the most difficult of reforms to ac
complish.
The campaign in Louisiana to
correct this evil has met with sim
ilar defdat to that .in New York.
Amendments prhich it was Ihought
would cure the evil and improve
our system were voted down by the
people; and the question war left
Sover to the present legislature. It
pould do notaing; but it r.uubmzit-_
ted the problem to the voters in an
amendment upon which they mustQ
vote at e coming o intion. *e'r
this amendment opposition has.been
souaUted and an ': armnzi team
paigu aganmit it wili be at· . ;i
ao bwapt offthe rIeiphAujon that
was; aeveloped before to assess-.
u:ent and tax relorm, uite ameid
men hnas been mane tStort, leaving
the tasa of equalizing assees.itie
.-and. pirovmdig enougs revenue.. or
the support of Ire state to uJ a Joa
:f woie and extraoramary poweris,
to: be known as tue '.olard oU
+..State Affair'' To', free this tlius
body from the local prejudices and
r popular otamor, it is8 made entirely
free and independent of the voters,
' ,being appointed 'by tUe governor
and responsirte to him alone. It is
given wide` and drastic powers, in
eluing. the right to remove assess
ors, to invesugate any (irm or cor
porauon in order to find the value
of its property, to send for books
'and papers, and to advise with Wre
several state aepartmentA as to
economy and effit.ency.
i-- tt is not surprising to hear com
plainta seat tue Doard is undem9
czratao in its origin; that it is-itasetd
! on tae oDJectioaou ie system of oen
tftas.ation; that its taxing powers
.-are excessive and will nelp to Duid
0up a politieln ohgarhy m t
` stiate; amd mat t.e tiendency will be
to use taoe control of assasiaisits
-wuieii mImiuoe zaxation, bor. cliti
cal auvansags. Ihese are tile com
pi tuu n matte aSgaEiS the amend
mernt and constitute :the " chief ar
.. guments used in any campaign or
Sganiedt to defeat. ILt 'jtere have
Ob eea mutterangs against. it in somel
Iof uie unuer-assessed Iarslines, but
. no organized opposition. Un the
:.other hand. there has been no ef
i fort to present the argumenta -m
alou~i ul tne proposed changes; and
the chances are always agains.t the
aun ptmvou ny the voters of any law
which they believe will pi~aeease
tielar taxes unless it be stiowa con
i.in: gly ,tnat it is necessary foi
'. the pulhic welfare, and is fair and
just to all.
Ine oult of the opposition comes
.i. use tax dodgers-from those
Sindividuals aand parishes which are
, not paying: their fair share of tal
ation. They constitute only a
i small proportion of the taxpayers.
s''e great majority of them pay
Stheir full share; ald for these not
only would their be no increase
r , tlle tax rate would probably be
Lessened by equalisation -of assess
ments.
Agam, it is quite -evidemnt that
Louisiana cannot continuq to oper
ate its government as it has fer
some y.ea's past wltboaiteiougi
revenue to support its variqi
;charities and institutions, and fac
ag almost annual deficitse. 'e du
.~a.t want to see the legislature coal
7 oled to levy extrnisordiary taxes
is it is doing each year, to meet de
ficits; but we want a budget made:
which will show how much the
state needs to maintain its several
departments and functions; and an,
assessment that will make all tax
payers pay a full and equal share
of that revenue.
As for he objection that the
menmbers of the board are not elec
ted by the voters and are not di
rectly responsible to them, experi
ence has shown how- necessary it
is to give control of- the assess
ment to men who do not have to
court. popular favor, to get elected,
but who are possessed of the abil
ity and tejchiical knowledge neces
sary to make a correct assessment.
Elective assessors almost inevitably
appeal to the voters to keep them
in office by cultivating popularity,
and there is no safer way for this
than to keep- assessments down.
'This. has been the principal bug
bear we have hiad to face.
We have tried nearly every
other plan to improve our assess
ment system and have been unable
to accomplislr an, actual advance,
and the present amendment is born
of4,his past experience in Louisiana
and throughout the Union. It 'is
the only wap we can get the dif
fiocuty straghtened ` out; that will
provide ep~aogh money to support
the state and its institutions, that
win 0ko taxation just, equal and
unirm; that will prevent deficits
es_ nd .e a diaa ta.el The-good
resulting frim the amendment will
outweigh a hundiedo-fold some of
the conditionl not altogether pala
table, but to whict . e must sub
mit is o to put Louisiana on a
proper footitg in all these matters
