DANlMW
REPORTS THAT
RAP EDISON
Charge Made by Naval Offi
cials of Strong
Favoritism.
Washington, Oct. 7.—A serious.con
flict has arisen between Secretary Jo
sephus Daniels and officers of the navy
over the use of Edison batteries in
submarines now being constructed for
the government.
Mr. Daniels, who is a warm friend
of Thomas A. Edison, is insisting that
the navy use Edison batteries.
Officers in charge of the construc
tion of the submarines assert that the
batteries are dangerous and should
not be used under any circumstances
as they are now made, inasmuch as
they give out too much hydrogen gas
while the vessels are submerged.
It was learned on high authority
today that the naval officers base their
opposition to the Edison batteries on
reports made by two boards of inves
tigation, both of which have been sup
pressed by Mr. Daniels.
E-2 Report Suppressed.
One of these boards named. to in
quire into the causes of the explosion
in the submarine E-2 at the Brooklvn
navy yard on January 15 last, result
ing in the death of four men and in
jury to ten others, returned a finding
that the accident was due to the Edi
son batteries. Secretary Daniels has
refused to make this report public.
In order, however, to get another
hearing for the Edison batteries Mr.
Daniels appointed a second board of
officers to make a general Inquiry into
the merits of various batteries which
were being offered the department for
instalment in submarines then build
ing and prospective. This board also
returned a finding against the Edison
battery and Mr- Daniels 'suppressed it.
Adverse Findings Rejected.
Meantime, however, according to
prominent officials of the department,
Mr. Daniels insisted on letting the
contract for batteries for the new
submarine L-8, now being constructed
at the Portsmouth navy yard, to the
Edison company. Recently, it is'said,
officers in charge of the construction
of the ship were assigned to test the
batteries purchased for it and prompt
ly urged their rejection. Their cost
to the government was between $75.
000 and $100,000. Mr. Daniels has
declined to reject them and Is insist
ing, it is said, on their installation in
the submarines.
Edison for Wilson.
Mr. Daniels made Mr. Edison chair
man of his civilian advisor}' board. Re
cently the activities of this board as
sumed a distinctly political character.
Mr. Edison announced.his Intention of
supporting President Wilson in the
campaign this .year.
If Secretary Daniels persists in his
suppression of the E-2 and the stor
age battery reports, an effort prob
ably will be made in congress to have
them made public

Ali Dinar Loses Darfur Af
ter Picturesque
Revolt.
Cairo, Egypt, Oct. 7.—Although
only a short time has passed since
the overthrow of the revolting suzer
ain of Darfur. Ali Dinar, by Anglo
Egyptian troops and the successful
.occupation of Darfur, a vast territory
some 160,000 square miles In extent,
the whole province is said to have
been thoroughly organized and
'brought under a British administra
tion providing the same code of law
and justice as prevails in the rest of
the Sudan.
Ali Dinar seized the occasion of the
outbreak of war between Great Bri
tain and Turkey to renounce his al
legiance to the Sudan government and
subsequently declared his adhesion to
the enemy. He endeavored to seduce
the chiefs and stir up dissatisfaction
in the Sudan and flouted repeated offi
cial warnings sent to him. Finally, at
the instigation of enemy agents, he
made preparations for offensive ac
tion. He publicly declared a ".Tehad."
or religious war, and announced his
intention of invading Sudan territory.
His action co-ordfnated with that of
the Grand Senussi and formed part
of a general movement against Egypt
and the Sudan.
The British governor general. Sir
Reginald Wingate, dispatched a small
force of the Egyptian army which
successfully occupied the well centers
of Jebel EI Hilla and Abaid, thus
pinning the sultan's army to Fasher
and closing the main road to the east.
The Anglo-Egyptians then defeated
the troops of Ali Dinar which occu
pied a strong position near Fasher.
The sultan's force, comprising the
flower of his army, had 1.200 casual
ties. Ali Dinar himself fled to Jebel
Marra, accompanied by some 1,500
followers. On the approach of an
aeroplane, however, a stampede was
caused by the explosion of bombs and
the majority of the sultan's escort
scattered and later surrendered.
Thd Anglo'-Brltlsh expedition, in
which aircraft were utilized for the
first time in the Sudan, involved the
maintenance of a long line of. com
munications over almost 300 miles of
waterless and roadless country.

Son of Copper King Has
Laid Aside Fund for
Sufferers.
Los Angeles, Oct. 7.—A war profit
chest, already bulging with gold to
the. value of $2,000,000 is to be un
locked and the yellow contents are
to be poured into France for the ben
efit of war orphans and destitute
families.
The owner of the war profit chest
is W. A. Clark, Jr., son of former

in "war babies." or bonds, from thp
governments engaged in the European
struggle.
By one of his close friends Mr.
Clark is quoted as saying recently:
"This war is terrible I want no
profit on account of it."
Mrs. Clark, who has taken a deep
interest in the work of assisting the
unfortunates and the condition of
those who remain in the broken
homes of Europe, has opened her
private purse.
According to present plans the fund
will not pour into France until peace
is declared and the roll called for
the husbandless and fatherless. It
is understood a fund will be estab

the supervision of the American am
