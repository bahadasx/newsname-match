THE HAGUE, Sept 17.—(By malL)
The Dutch government only two
tontbs ago sounded the European
iUgeomt* «a the prospects of peace,.
ie United Fran was informed today,
(very belligerent, except France, ex
ressed a willingness to enter an ln
irmal discussion.
France's reply was such a fiery re
sal that one person who learned its
mtents described it as "almost an
ttimatum."
[A Rome dispatch to the United
yesterday carried the first in
itiation that Holland had been put
ng out peace feelers. Thte dispatch
ated that the allies had Informed
olland that peace overtures at this
me would be construed as a pro
erman move.]
Dutch officials not only have re
uned their attempt at peace nego
ations, but they are now convinced
lat the end of the war Is a long
ay off.
The one positive indication that
ieace is impossible at present, is the
ride difference of opinion Of opposing
lides regarding the situation in the
anks of the other. In the past few
ays I have been to Copenhagen, Ber
jn, The Hague and Rotterdam. The
Irst impression obtained by a trav

[United Press Leased "Wire Service.]
WASHINGTON, Oct 7.—Llkllhood
of the United States government act
ing as a prominent factor to bring
peace to the warring powers of Burope
is dwindling day by day according to
general belief in official circles here.
The..subject once more Is receiving
diplomatic consideration on the eve of
Ambassador Gerard's return to this
country from Berlin, Count Von Bern
storff's visit to the president at Shad
ow Lawn next Monday and as a result
of the president's continued utter
ances on the subject of world's peace
for the future.
Two points are made by those who
believe the United States will make
no further move to end hostilities—
and probably will be unable to aid in
the readjustments between the Europ
ean countries when Che war ends:
First—Great Britain, through an in
terview given the United Press by
Lloyd Geqrge has plainly said "hands
ofT—that any attempt by the United
States to Intercede in behalf of peace
would be regarded with hostlHty.
'Second—The political situation In
the country has aroused to a marked
degree partisan fefellhgB for one or the
other of the warring sides. It has re
sulted In stirring up a feeling abroad
that the united States is not strictly
neutral and as President Wilson re
cently said in an address at Shadow
Lawn, this feeling has reached a point
where even diplomatic interference be
tween this country and) foreign na
tions will be seriously embarrassed un
til after November 7, because foreign
diplomats are waiting to see what will
be the outcome of the election."
Perhaps no expression by the presi
dent in recent months has aroused so
much conjecture here as that
Omaha Thursday night when he said:
"When we look forward to the years
to come—I wish I could say the
months to come—and to the end of
this war, we want the world to know
we are ready to lend our force to the
preservation of peia'ce.'-
This is regarded here as plainly in
dicative the president feels the end
of the war may be far off—and also
that he feels the work of America will
be to preserve the peace of the fu
ture, not to intervene now.
From those with the president,
comes the word that he knows noth
ing regarding a report that Ambassa
dor Gerard is bringing with him to
this country a request of the German
government to intercede in behalf of
peace. But there is a strong belief
in official circles here that the presi
dent will not make any further move
either directly or Indirectly toward of
fering his good offices, unless such
plea is made openly by one or more of
the belligerent nations.
