Protests Against Alleged Neu

International News Service:
WASHINGTON, Oct. 7. Protests

trality by the Pnited States consular
and diplomatic officials have been
filed with the state department by
diplomatic representatives of several
of the belligerent countries of Eu
rope. The protests now arc pend
ing before .tat department oficials
and are perplexing them as to how
they should be handled.
The burden of the protest is that
the Pnited States, through certain
officials and departments, has made
known Generally trade secrets and
other information relating to in
ternal affairs of the belligerent coun
tries. This information, it is
charged, has fallen into hands of
enemies who have been able to use
it to the disadvantage of the nations
reported upon.
An effort plainly is heinc: made.
officials say. through these protests
to muzzle the American Government
so far as reports on the trade of the
various countries of the world aro
concerned. Should these efforts
succeed American merchants, man
ufacturers and exporters will he cut
eff from sources of information upon
which they are relyinp for aid in
building up a strong foreicm trade
now and 'it the close of the war.
fstate department officials have
clashed with representative of other
departments on the protests, the
state department heinc; inclined to
prevent puoliration while other gov
ernment officials take the side of the
American business men and ure
full publicity statins that there is
no real violation of neutrality in

shrieking, the call "piny ball" was
sounded at 2 o'chK'k and the strug
