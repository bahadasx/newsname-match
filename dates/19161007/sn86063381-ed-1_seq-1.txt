THE BEMIDJI DAILY PIO
Law And Rules Regulating
Use O Autos On Highways
The number of automobile cases at the present term of the district
court has suggested to the Pioneer the advisability of printing a some-
what brief abstract of the laws and rules governing the operation of
cars on the highways and streets. The Pioneer hopes that what it has
done may help to avoid accident and prevent litigation.
Every owner of a motor vehicle
driven upon the public highways of
this state, except fire apparatus, etc.,
must register his motor vehicle and
receive from the secretary of state
a tag or plate containing the num
ber of his registration. This tag or
number is issued in duplicate and
one must be conspicuously displayed
on the rear and one on the front of
such vehicle and so fastened as to
prevent the same from swinging, and
the person driving the vehicle must
keep this tag or plate free from
grease, dust or other blurring ma
terial so as to be plainly visible at
all times. This provision does not
apply to non-residents, unless such
non-resident remains continuously
within the state for more than thirty
days, in which event he is obliged
(o register his vehicle and secure the
plate in the same manner as if he
were a resident owner.
Every motor vehicle operated up
on the public highway shall be pro
vided with adequate brakes sufficient
to control the vehicle at all times
and a suitable, adequate bell, horn
or other device for signaling, and
shall, during the period from one
hour after sunset to one hour before
sunrise display at least two lighted
lamps visible from the front and a
red light in the rear shedding white
rays which shall shine upon the
number plate carried on the rear of
such vehicle.
No motor vehicle shall be permitted
to remain standing on any public
street or highway or in the public
street or highway unattended at any
time with the motor running.
Every motor vehicle using gaso
line as a motive power shall use a
muffler and the same shall not be
cut out or disconnected within the
limits of any city or village, or at
the time or passing any horse or ani
mal being lead, driven or ridden.
All vehicles, other than motor ve
hicles, shall carry while driven on
any public highway between one hour
after sunset and one hour before sun
rise a white light visibls from both
front and the rear.
A person driving a motor vehicle
shall, on signal by raising the hand
or by request from a person riding,
leading or driving a horse or horses
bring such motor vehicle immediately
to a stop, and if driving in the oppo
site direction remain stationary so
long as may be reasonable to allow
such horse or animals to pass, and
if driving in the same direction use
reasonable caution thereafter passing
such horse animals. In case such
horse or animals appear badly fright
ened, or the person operating such
motor vehicle is so signaled or re
quested to, such person shall cause
the motor of such vehicle to cease
running so long as shall be reason
ably necessary to prevent accident
and insure the safety of others.
Upon approaching a pedestrian
who is upon the traveled part of any
highway and not upon a sidewalk,
and upon approaching an intersect
ing highway or a curve or corner in
the highway where the operator's
view is obstructed, every person op
erating a motor vehicle shall slow
down and give due signal with his
bell or horn or other device for sig
naling provided, however, that no
person shall unreasonably obstruct or
impede the right of travel upon the
public highway of the driver of a
motor vehicle or of a horse, and any
one so doing shall be guilty of a mis
demeanor.
Upon approaching a crossroad out
side the limits of the city or incor
porated village, the operator must
slow down the speed of his machine
and sound his horn in such a man
ner as to give notice and warning of
his approach.
A person driving with a horse or
team or motor vehicle shall meet" an
other person driving with a horse,
team or motor vehicle, moving in op
posite direction, each person shall
slacken his pace if necessary and
reasonably turn to the right so- as
td timely give half of the traveled
road if practicable and a fair and
equal opportunity to the-oth^r-to
pass. If they are moving in the same
direction, the person overtaking shall
pass on the left side of the other and
the person overtaken shall, as soon
as practicable, turn to the right so

STATEMENTS FROM
RIVAL MANAGERS
Manager Carrigan, Boston
"I have faith in the ability
of my men. I have been
through this fire and expen
ence will help me in critical
times. The pitching and field
ing ability will carry us
through the day."
Manager Robinson, Brook
lyn"I will not make any
prediction on the outcome.
My boys have never taken a
part in the world's series as -jc
a team but Marquard, Mer
kle, Coombs and Meyers are
veterans and are steady play
ers. Their out-pitching will
offset their hitting"
The finely drawn finish of the races
in the two leagues has aroused unpre
cedented interest in the series games.
Not until the last week of the cam
paign in each league did the winners
of the pennants feel sure they would
go into the title clashes.
Fans in Line.
As usual in a world's series, this
morning found the long line of wait
ing fans at the baseball park.
Newspapers, crumpled and mussed
in the streets, soap boxes turned on
end, and the remains of "hot dog"
sandwiches gave evidence of the long
night watch-of some.
Long before noon streets leading
to the baseball park were filled with
autos headed for the ball park and
traction lines were loaded with per
sons wending their way to the scene
of the conflict.
Seats in the grandstand and boxes
were sold out several days ago and
only general admission tickets, and
only enough of these to fill the seats
in that section, are on sale.
