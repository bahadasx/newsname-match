BEAUTY PARLORS
OPENED AT THE
PARISIAN HERE
One of the most interesting ann
ouncements made thru this issue of
the Republican, (especially to the
ladies) is the fact that "The Parisian"
has opened beauty parlors in their
establishment on Center Street. With
Miss Callaliau, a graduate of the
Marincllo System of Beauty Culture,
in charge. These parlors like the
Parisian Ready-to-wear department
is the very acme of perfection in ap
pointment and detail. In beauty and
refinement it is what one would ex
pect to find in the most metropol
itan centers. Aside from being a
source of pride to all residents of
this city, the news of the opening
of these parlors will be a boon to th:
women of Logan and the valley.
All kinds of facial, scalp and hair
treatments arc made by an expert,
and patrons of these parlors can be
assured the most thorough and sat
isfactory treatment. These parlors
are "things of beauty" as is the
Parisian Store itself and to be ap
preciated must be seen.

Mr Hughes pledges for himself and
for his party that tho commodities
Utah produces shall bo protected by
tariffs during his Incumbency as
thoy hnvo been protected by war dur
ing his rival's Incumbency. Ho
promises for Utah tho prosperity of
protected industry In time of poaco to
replace tho prosperity that Is bathed
In blood and that must of necessity
eenso when blood ceases to How. Ho
promises for Utah n return of tho
brand of prosperity that flourished in
Utah when Mr. Wilson was elected
and that was abruptly halted by his
program of assault upon Industry.
A piosperlty dependent upon cir
cumstances oor which tho Unltod
States can cxerclso no control must
of necessity bo but temporary for
circumstances change. Tho war will
not last foreer, Indeed Indications
multiply that It is already cntorini;
upon Its most lntensivo nnd final

destruction to production. Lessons

of war will bo applied to tho con

JENSEN CANDY
COMPANY IS
MAKING GOOD
Very few people realize the growth
of the W. F. Jensen Candy Co on
North Main Street anil they could
not realize the importance of this
company in the community without
making a isit to the candy factory
and see the number of girls and
young men who are kept constantly
busy in the manufacture of candies
which arc used to keep up the re
tail stock of his unpretentious candy
parlors and to supply his wholesale
trade. Mr. Jensen started in the con
fectionery business in a small way
about four years ago in Logan. To
day it is necessary to employ the ser
vices of a big Denby truck to trans
port his manufactured goods to the
consumers in all the towns of Cache
Valley and he has a good healthy
demand for his candies in Box Elder
county, in the towns of Garland,
Tremonton and Collinston.
The display of hard candies which
Mr 'Jensen-exhibited afthe- county
fair attracted wide attention and it
was really a marvel to many to know
that such a big variety of manufact
ured candies arc being turned out
by this growing concern.
CARD OMHANKS
We desire to express to our many
dear friends our sincere thanks and
appreciation for the many kind
nesses which they so generously
showered upon us during the time of
the illness and death of our beloved
son and brother, Levi Riter. Espec
ially do we wish to thank all those
who spoke at the funeral services,
those who rendered the sweet music
and those who contributed the
beautiful flowers.

Mayor P. A Thatcher The Chau- j .;
tauqua held in our city last June "
was certainlj an entertainment to be '!j '
recommended to any community S I
that has a desire to stimulate the 'I
civic pride and elevate the moral I
standard of its people. The lectures I
alone are worth many times the I
effort and cost. The .entertainments W
arc splendid and of high order. I
G. W. Skidmorc The bringing of 1
the Chautauqua to Logan was one 1
more evidence of the activity and I
progress of those responsible for ' "
doing things in our thriving city. I
The programs were all of high char- I
acter. I am sure that the good ac-
complishcd is inestimable, and feel 'I
that the public generally will wcl- lj -I
come the return of the Chautauqua j! ''
next season. ' I
J. W. Morrell From the comment I "?
I have heard from different people il
since the Ciiauauqiia was here I am J Jm
sure tl'at "t "moff than came up to ,, 1 1
expectations. It has done us a lot of ' ?
good individually and collectively, i il
and I will be glad to sec it come again II
A. L. Farrell It would seem al- '.I
most superfluous for me, or for any jI
other individual, to express a person- 'M
al opinion as to the merits of the il
Chautauqua held in our community ' I
last June. Thousands of people at- v'l
tended every session of the organi- j ll
zatiou, all of whom, without except- II
ion as it were, seemed to be of but '
one mind, viz. that it was a class of "I
entertainment, enlightenment and M
amusement that has never been ex- iW
celled in this territory; that it was f M
clean, wholesome, instructive and dc- ?';
llghtful; that it was more (than we -
could have expected for the money; ijll
that it was just what wc wanted and Hl
we got it. Hljsl
What more could the individual Hi
say, except to voice his approval and uKII
commendation with those of the mill- PaBI
tittidc? pHl
Besides the unusual excellence of :fll
the show itself, the management was VmI
efficiency plus. There was no dis- 'al
order, no hitches, no dclayes. In "J1
short and in fact, it was a splendid 091
affair in every respect, and it came ijl
and went like a pleasant dream. 41 1

Octobor C, 1000 "Mr. Hughes' pos
Itlvo methods as a reformer aro
known to nil men. Ho dealt with in
surauco corruption and high llnanco
crookedness as relentlessly as he
now unmasks olllco seeking demagog
Ism. His record is to bo read In tho
iitatutes passed at Albany."
Octobor 8, 190G. "Ho hos appoalod
not as a partisan to partisans but as
a citizen to citizens. Tho addresses
of tho scholarly lawyer havo beon
slmplo and straightforward, strong In
sincerity, effectlvo In earnestness.
October 11, 190C "Mr. Hughes said
In his Buffalo speech, on October 10,
1900, that ho would endeavor to havo
raoro mouoy appropriated to onforco

Mr. Hughes promises nothing that tSM
ho cannot and will not perform." 1

of Now York a clean, honest admin- fBI
Utratlan, frcn from boss rulo aud cor- iflfl
