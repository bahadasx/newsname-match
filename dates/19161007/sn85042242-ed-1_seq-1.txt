Billings, Mont., Oct. 6.—In a box
car battle between negroes and "white
men near Nihill, in Meagher county,
last night, one white man was killed,
two others were severely wounded
and one negro slightly injured.
The dead man was Michael Levings,
who, together with C. E. Campbell,
and L. Sitzwell, boarded the box car
to ride to a nearby town in search
of work. Campbell was shot four
times, but it is not believed his in­
juries wilt prove fatal. The third
member of the party, Sitzwell, was
beaten severely about the head and
body by the negroes and was picked
up unconscious.
Whites Trod On Negro's Hand.
Information reaching here today
was to the effect that the three
whites, said to be harvest hands,
boarded the box car at Nihill, and
upon entering the dark interior, ac­
cidentally trod upon the hand, of a
sleeping negro. The altercation fol­
lowed, in which fists gave way to re­
volvers. Levings was the first to fall,
hiB body being precipitated from the
open door of the car, and. Campbell
fell to the floor of the car with four
bullets in his body. The negroes are
said to have then attacked Sitzell and
beaten him unconscious.
Nine Men Are Held.
Nine men are held at Judith Gap
pending an itivestigatiorw The- two
white men have identified certain of

The long abandoned Northern Paci­
fic right, of way through the McKenzie

good gravel for the surfacing of the
new road through the swamp, which
is being built under the direction of
J. H. Dodge, veteran federal road
builder. William Watson of McKen­

the hauling of the gravel. The haul
in no instance will exceed 1% miles,
and in some cases the gravel must
be transported only a few feet.
The fill will be about six feet high
at the highest point. Near the middle
will be built a concrete bridge, for
which the contract has been awarded
to the Fargo Bridge & Iron Works

Apple creek folk are opposed to

to the county board a petition pray­

the use of the open winter range in

dopted a resolution to this effect and
decided to pass the buck to the peo­

The hundred million mark has been

by the comparative statement for

Four trust companies and 671 state
banks September 12 reported resour-|

compared with $90,935,416.30 June 30,
1916, and $72,175,495.13 at the close
of business September 2, 1915. This
gain of almost thirty percent within
the space of a year is regarded as
remarkable, and it is a positive proof
that North Dakota is prosperous and
progressing.
Gain In Deposits
The report shows that checking ac­

COMMERlLlUB TO
PAY PRJZB FOR CORN
Will Boost Exposition to be Held
in Connection with Poultry
Meet
Attractive prizes for the best ex­
hibits of corn of the several varieties
displayed at the corn, poultry and al­
falfa show, to be held in connection
with the annual meeting of the Mis­
souri Slope Poultry association in
Bismarck next January will be offered
by the Commercial club.
The club committee on agriculture
met with Secretary' Milhollan of the
poultry association yesterday and
pledged its support to the big mid­
winter show. The amount of the
prizes has not been determined, but
it is probable that they will aggre­
gate $200, and thaft the individual
wards and sweep-stakes will be made
large enough to attract exhibits from
all parts of the slope.
Many Prizes for Corn.
In addition to the Commercial club
prizes, awards probably will be offer­
ed by Morton, Dickinson and other
slope counties for the best corn exhi­
bited by their citizens, and valuable
cups may be hung up by other agen­
cies interested in the development
of central and western North Dakota.
Suitable prizes will also be offered
for alfalfa.
Secretary Milhollan will have his
premium lists out in a few days. In
point of attendance, exhibits and in­
terest, the coming exposition is ex­
pected to prove by far the best in the
history of the association. There is
more interest today in poultry, corn
and alfalfa 1han ever before noted in
North Dakota.
VIOLATED GAME LAWS
Northern Pacific Laborers In North
Dakota Are Mulcted $200.
Jamestown, N. D., Oct. 5.—Fines to­
taling $200 were paid by five laborers
on the Northern Pacific Monday for
violating the state game and fish laws.
The arrests were made by Game
Warden Malcolm Sinclair.
Guiseppi Mustilli pleaded guilty to
the charge of not having a non-resi
dent license and was fined $50 and
costs, amounting to $60 Decarlo Gues
sezzo, Antonio Campiona, C. Bizz and
Lini Vincenzo were each fined $25
and costs, or $35 apiece, for failing
to state that they were not citizens
of the United States, as is provided
in sections of the game laws. The
guns were taken and used as evi­
dence.
Game Warden Sinclair states that
reports have been reaching him of late
of restaurant keepers serving and sell­
ing wild game and charging for it.
He believes that many do not kn»w
that it is a violation of the state game
laws.

Second Degree Murder Convict
From Marmath Was Much in
Print Year Ago
Denver Woods, North Dakota's
prize honor prisoner,, is in the toils
again. This news reached the peni­
tentiary last night in the form of a*
dispatch from Miles City advising that
Denver and his brother, Oscar Woods,
had been convicted of grand larceny
at Baker, Mont.- The sentences
drawn were not giveitf Evidently Den­
ver's brother is something of an honor
man himself, as the dispatch states
that Oscar was rele&sed on bonds,
pending trial, September 15, to per­
mit him to attend hiri wedding.
Sent Up From Marmarth.
Denver Woods was s?nt up in April,
1911, from Hettinj##.'Adams county,
on a thirteen gears' sentence for sec­
ond degree manslaughter, lie imme­
diately set about becoming a model
prisoner, and he succeeded so well
that about two years ago, when his
mother passed away, Denver was per­
mitted to journey-unaccompanied to
Montana for the obsequies. He re­
ported back to prison on the day set,
and his high sense of honor won for
him hundreds of columns of publicity
in the state press, whose sob artists
worked overtime on the story.
Honor Proeurea Parole.
So much attention was attracted
to Denver Woods through this jour­
ney and so excellent was his prison
record that in December, 1914, he
was released on parole. Since that
time he has been in Adams county,
or across the line, neai Baker, Mont.,
to letter pla«e lip again baa
run afoul the 'authorities.
May Have Eight Years More.
What effect Denver's latest esca­
pade will have on his unserved sen­
tence of about eight years in North
Dakota could not be stated at the
penitentiary last night. The warden
was out of town, and the files were
locked up. There was no question,
however, that during the five years
which he did spend within the prison
walls Denver's record was 99.97 per
cent pure, nor that he has had a per­
fect parole record since leaving the
prison.
The specific charge in the present
instance is "rustling," some strange
mavericks having been found in a
parcel of cattle which the Woods
were herding. The prison authorities
had been advised of the arrest of
Denver Woods, but did not learn of
the conviction until last evening.

Great Excitement Follows Crash,

Norfolk, Va., Oct, 6.—The British
steamer, Hawkhead, at anchor in
Hampton Roads, off Sewald's Point,
was run down and sunk about S
o'clock tonight by the Chesapeake
Steamship company's Bay Line steam­
er, City of Norfolk, outward bound
from this port for Baltimore, with a
number of passengers. The City of
Norfolk was badly damaged about the
bow, but there was no loss of life,
so far as is known. The collision oc­
curred during a heavy log.
Captain Hand and the crew of the
Hawkhead were taken off by small
boats lowered by the City of Norfolk,
the river steamer, Pocahontas, and
other craft which were passing. Fif­
teen minutes after being struck, the
British ship had settled on the bot­
tom in 30 feed of water.
Most of the 100 passengers on the
City of Norfolk were at dinner when
the crash came. There was great ex­
citement for a few minutes, but the
officers soon succeeded in restoring
order.
Although the City of Norfolk's bow
was carried away for ten feet, the
collision bulkheads held, and she
turned about and steamed slowly
back to this port, being assisted by
tugs.
NOT REQUESTED
TO E
U. S. Will Not Be Asked to At-
tempt to End the European
War
Officials at the department today
said that only a specific request for
mediation by one of the belligerents
would bring about any efforts by this
country to effect a European peace.
In the absence of Secretary Lans­
ing, who is ill at his home, high offi­
cials of the department said no action
would be taken by this government
unless actually requested. Even if a
direct offer were to come from one
side, doubt was expressed whether a
willingness to receive mediation
would have to come from both sides
before this country would act.
There is a growing conviction
among some officials that a military
peace brought about by almost direct
negotiations between the belligerents
will be the probable outcome of the
war.
