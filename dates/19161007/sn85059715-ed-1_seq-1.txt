BOSTON? Oct. 7.?A crowd of
great numbers turned today to
Braves field for the opening game of
the world's series of 1916. The
Brooklyn*, winners of the National
League pennant, challenging the
American League supremacy, defend
ed by the Boston club, proved an ob
ject of wide appeal to baseball en
thusiasts. ,
The teams were favored In the first,
meeting with weather conditions
closely approaching the ideal. The ,
dav was almost summer like with
only n Blight tang of autumn In the
air which caused some spectators to
brlns wraps. There was wind likely j
to enter into the calculations pf field
ers. Clouds were fleece-like and with
no portent of rain.
It was in this atmosphere, sur
charged with the current of baseball's
greatest crowd, that, the crowd gath
ered and exchanged gossip of tl>?
probabilities of play. "Who will
pitch for Boston?" wail the big ques
1lon before the game. Manager Car
rlgan hod upset, calculations at the
eleventh hour by authorizing the i
(statement that his selection would be'
Ruth, Shore or Mays. Ruth was re-1
carded as his probable choice. Those
close to him had Indicated twenty- .
four hours previously that Leonard !
would pitch. The reason for the lat
ter's elimination did not develop.
For Brooklyn it was thought JItt-1
quard would servo his left-handed j
shoots which had proved effective.
ngalnnt the Hed Sox tenm in the ser- |
les of 1912 when he appenred as a
?member or the New York Nationals, i
The identity or opposing pitchers
was a considerable factor In compo-1
Rition or the lineups or either team,
both Manager Hoblnron. or Brooklyn,
?nd Carrigan, rolying on interchange
rlln outfields to bring out added
rtrength. Stengel, a weak batsman |
against left-handed pitchers, has nn
chance In a Brooklyn line-up against
Ttuth or Leonard. His place will be
taken by Meyers. Similarly Walker.
Speaker's successor at center Held tor
Boston, would bo thrown out oT com
petition with Marquat'd in the box
ror Brooklyn, the recruit. Shorten,
being a more effective batter against
pitching rrom the south side. Mana
ger Carrigan. it is understood, has
decided to have HoblKzell play at
first base throughout the series in
stead or putting Gainer ngainst a
flort-handed pitcher.
With these ractors in mind, base
llball followers drew up the rollowlng
ins the probable batting order:
Brooklyn Boston
Johnston, rf Hooper, rf

The mass of people who swarmed
.through the broad reaches or Braves
ifleld chosen as the stage for tho local
game because of its tremendous seat
ing capacity, grew rapidly fro^i small
.groups who had spent the night ?
ithe bleacher gates. The night line
,-was smaller than had preceded anj
world's Berles game played In tins
city In years. At daybreak knots ot
dirty persons each were gathered on
Hhe threshold or the park awaiting
the opening or the gates Some
slept, others walked out. while more

BELLA I RE, O.. Oct. 7.?Declaring ?
that the Ions strike In the east Ohio
coal field, which resulted In the in-1
auRiiration of the run-of-mine basis I
for miners, had materially assisted in
bringing the same system to other Im
portant coal fields, William Green, In
ternational secretary-treasurer of the
United .Mine Workers of America, at
the .Miner's day celebration here to

Jdelity to the principles of the or
ganisation.
"Fifteen thousand miners In the
eor ern Ohio coal field are today work
ing under a contract covering a period
of two years, and the agrfcemcnt, while I
no doubt containing some objection-1
able features and not embodying cer
tain rights to which the mine workers
are entitled, nevertheless provides for
the weighing and paying for coal upon
an absolute run of mine basis.
"Only a short time ago the mine
workers here were engaged In a con
test with their employers. All of us
can remember the fourteen months'
struggle through which they passed
when they were struggling for the run
or-mlne system. Then hunger and
want and suffering prevailed, whereas
now the mines are running, the men
are working and a reasonable decree
ofpeace and satisfaction prevails. The
miners of eastern Ohio deserve the
highest credit for the splendid manner
In which tney cttrrled forward the fight

WASHINGTON, Oct 7.?Tile Under

rnal failure of any rovenuo legislation
In tho history of the counlry.
"The Democrats boasted during the
campaign "we will reduce the coat of
living," "we will take the taxes off
the people." Tho Wilson administra
tion Jammed the Underwood tariff law
through Congress and In one year moro
than three million men were out of
work, tho cost of living was higher
than ever before, and It has slnoe
steadily Increased. The next day after
the Underwood tariff law was paBsod
Mr. Underwood said It would do four
things: Roduce tho cost of living,
would not disturb tho business of tho
country, would Increase our foreign
trade, and would collect revenue suffic
ient to run the government It has
done none of these things, so glibly
promised.
The Underwood tariff took from tie
dutiable list and put on the free list
cattle, slioep, wool, beof, mutton, com,
eggs, milk and cream. It put wheat
and potatoes on tho freo list condi

per cent the tariff rates on horses,

From Federal Office Holders in
Violation of the Spirit of
Criminal Code.
SKATE ON VERY THIN ICE
Amount of the Levy upon Them
for Wilson is Ten Per Cent
of Year's Salary.
NEW YORK, Oct. 7?Carefully
propured plans of tho national Demo
cratic executive committee to extort
a campaign fund of several million*
from federal ofllco holder* In violation
or th Hplrlt of tbo criminal code and
or the civil service act were disclosed
at Republican national headquarter*
here. The plana purpose the railing
or this hUK0 tund for the re-election
of President Wilson.
The rramors of the plan are per
fectly aware of the fact that they are
skating on vory thin Ite and have
striven to direct tho procedure of
their subordinates so as to enable
thorn to elfect a substantial violation
of tho law without being caught. Thb
men who aro endeavoring to put the
plans In operation boldly confess to
I ho subordinates upon whom they re
ly for the actual strong-arm work,
that they aro deliberately seeking to
evade the statutory provision! to
which. In public and for tho purposes
or campaign argumont only, they
mako such protuso provision of de
votion. The llrst drive or the cash
collectors for tho Democratic com
mittee Is alined at postmasters, but It
Is Hpecl flcally set rorth that all other
Tederal appointees as well are oxpect
ed to contribute to the Wilson cam
paign fund. The amount of the levy
upon them Ik ten per cent of one
year's salary.
The postolllce appropriation bill ap
proved by President Wilson July 28
last, carries an Item "Tor compensa
tion to postmasters, $31,000,000." If
tho Democratic bai;inon are only, reas
onably successful In holding up post
masters, they can expect to accumafei
late a fund or many hundreds of
thousands or dollars, If not millions,
from postmasters alone. And this
takes no account or tho many thous
ands or other federal appointee:
whom those plans of the Democrat!
campaign committee make specially, ,
subject to tho visit of tho bagman.'
Tho Democratic framers of thei
plans lor extorting Wilson campalg
runds rrom federal officeholders un
derstand exactly the very delicate le
gal situation of their scheme. They
arc caretul to sot forth In the Instruc
tion to tho strong arm squad the f
that "of course this Is not compul
sory" obviously meaning that It Is not
legally compulsory?but they pro
ceed to state that they are Informed
that thero Is to be a permanent or
ganization "of our force throughout
the country." This permanent or
ganliatlon Is to keep tabs on the fed
eral officeholders. A record Is to be
made "of tho loyalty" of those ap
pointees who contribute and of thoee
"disloyalty" of thoee federal office
holders who decline to contribute to
the Wilson campaign fund.
