People mill Kever Submit, Says
Nationalist leader
WOULD NOT HELP ARMY
Calls Move a Politic.nl Device To
Discredit Island's Future and
Create Discord.
Watorford, Ireland. Oct. ;. In a
notable address to his constituents
here this forenoon, John P.eilmoufl. tne

declared that, despite the recent re
bellion, "with all its inevitable alter
math of brutalities, stupidities, and in
flamed passions," home rule for lie

Mr. Redmond also declared that con
scription could ne.er be forced upon
Ireland, adding:
"I cannot bring myself tj belivo
that, malign thougn the influences at
work are, the. government Mill be in
sane enough to challenge a conflict
with Ireland on this subject, t (in

the most fatal thing that would Imp

"It would be resisted in every village
in Ireland. Its attempted enforce

Continuing, the Irish parliamentary
leader said:
"The inert; threat is paralyzing re
cruiting, which mark you, 1-i not neat!,
as some people say. The latent tiaures,
indeed, show that from the late of the
rising, t Paster Sunday until Septem

a genuine military demand, it i." a
base political device put for .van, by
men who want to injure and discredit

any and. every humus bad blood be

hope that when the war is over the

But, whatever the motive back of the
proposal may be, it will never be car

"The way to continue to M t ri emits
is far different. App'riro the inflamed
feeling in Ireland. Withdraw Maitial
law. Make it plain that the Defense of
the Realm act ill be adminstered, not
us it is being administeiej now in dif
ferent parts of Ireland, but in the
same spirit as it is adminstered in
Kngland. Scotland and Wales. Treat
prisoners arrested during the rising
as politcal prisoners. Put a:i end to
insults and attcaka upon Ireland and
recognized generally what she has
done.
"On these lines the government may
succeed in recruiting, even alter all
that has happiiened. lint as for con

TO PROVIDE FOR SOLDIERS.
England Plans to Set Aside $1uo,000
000 as a Startsr.
London, Oct. 7. England's deter
mination to provide the best possible
housing accommodation lor the
Hohlleis on 'their return to civil life
is reilei-ted in plans formulated to set
aside as a beginning if lOO.iitm.noij of
government, money as advances to
local authorities and other agencies,
to provide houses for the working
classes at reasonable rent. Mr. Long
president of the Local Government
Itoatd. told a deputation that the
plans actually before the Hoard rep
resented but a .small beginning. Ho
added:
' it would be a 1 la -k crime to let our
soldiers come buck from waterlogged
and horrible trenches to something
little better than a pig-stay." He had
told a deputation representing the
Housing and To n planning Congress
some time ago that the -0, eon, noo
pounds asked for by them should not
represent even an Index of what might
be required. He ehiphasi.ed that if
the government tame to the aid of the
local authorities in the matter, it, must
be on liberal lines, ile also said it was
vital to tin t uf tire of the race that
there should be provision for as many
as pos.ibli in these districts in order
to keep the land occupied.
The move is one of many indicating
that in the estimation of the govern
ment, nothing is to be to good for
ihe men who helped in the war on
their return, ft is a harbinger of the
social revolution that has been so fie
qutnlly predicted and which affects
all clause.

GERARD
PEACE mi
IS DENIED
President Has No Knowledge of
Reported Wove to End War
DISCREDITED' BY BERNSTORfF
Ambassador Says He Has Information
Disproving New York Newspaper
Story.
New York, Oct. 7. The New York
Evening I'ost yesterday published a
story caying that it has been learned
from a trustworthy source that Em
bassador Jomes W. Gerard, now on
his way back from Germany, will lay
before President Wilson a request
that the president use his good offices
in suing for peace with the allies,
"Germany has decided to apply to
President Wilson," the article reads,
"to use bis good oflices in suing for
peace with the allies. This was learn
ed today from sources In a position to
have absolutely trustworthy informa
tion on these matters. It is under
stood that Embassador James W. Ge
rard, who Is on iiis way over here,
will lay the kaiser's request before
President Wilson within a week
It is a fact, however, positively it may
have been denied officially, that the
possibility of President Wilson acting
as mediator has been discussed by Ger
man officials with Embassador Ger
ard. It is therefore, by no means sur
prising that the reports now take de
finite shape in connection with Mr.
Gerard's trip to this country." Em
bassador Gerard is olr board the
steamship Frederlk VIII. due in New
York about Tuesday next.
The I'ost says that the news was
given out by important banking in
terests in New York. Enough cre
dence was placed in tne report to
affect materially the stock market,
there being a reaction that affected all
stocks on the market, especially the
"munition shares." The Post says
that the fact that the market did not
respond more violently Indicated a
considerable incredulity.
If Embassador Gerard Is returning
to the United States on any mission
other than to spend a belated vaca
tion, officials of the state department
at Washington disclaim any krrow
ledge of it. The statement has been
authorized that no preparations for
the discussion of peace through diplo
matic channels have been made and
that all information gathered at Wash
ington seems to indicate that such a
move would be inadvisable as well as
futile. There have been various re
ports of plans of President Wilson to
deal with this matter directly instead
of through the state department.
Officials cf the German embassy
received the story with the emphatic
statement that they knew beyond
doubt that it was not. true. The tier
man embassador would not discuss
the story beyond saying it was un
true, but he was very emphatic in his
declaration that lie had information
positively disproving it.
On Hoard the President's Train,
Crestline, Ohio, Oct. 6. President
Wilson was told tonight of published
reports that Ambassador Gerard, now
on bis way home from his post in Ber
lin, was bringing suggestions that the
United States make a new move for
peace.
The statement was authorized that
the President knew of no such mis
sion. Recently he said himself that
Mr. Gerard was coining home only for
a vacation.
Washington, Oct. 6. Count van
Dernstorff, the German Ambassador,
would not discuss today the story of
Ambassador Gerard having a peace
mission from Germany, beyond saying
it was untrue, but he was very em
phatic In his declaration that he had
information positively disproving it.

While the players are in Doston

The public service commission held
a meeting Friday afternoon at 1.30.
It was found Impossible to use the
store in the Putnam house block,
where the hearing was scheduled to
take place, so those present adjourned
to the ollices of Holden and Ilealy.
The representatives of the railroad
prposed that the decision concerning
the underpass proposed for the grade
crossing near the old St. Francis de
Sales church be delayed for some
time, until it should be learned whet
her such construction be really neces
sary or not. James C. Colgate, John
Spargo and Walter H. Derry spone
briefly in favor of this motion. Jonn
Shilinger, engineer for the railroad
company gave for a preliminary
rough estimate of the cost, 128,000 ex
clusive of property damage. It was
suggested that in case the construc
tion be put through, the residence of
Thomas Holleran be removed in order
to obtain a clear view. Mr. Holloran,
represented by C. M. Graves, said that
,he would be agreeable to this, provid
ed, of course, that the compensation
be sufficient.
Chairman Robert C. Dacon of Drat
