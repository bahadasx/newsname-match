break would! take place.
Many officials are expressing dis
satisfaction with some sections of the
note and do not believe it can bo
accepted unconditionally. However,
the opinion as to .whether .or'not It
, requires an answer is divided. Tho
decision rests with .President Wilson,
and until ho makes up his mind no
official expression of opinion will be

Boycott After

To Block Vvace
(My Associated Press.)
.Muy ?.?The propos?e boycott,
after tho war, of Gorman products in
Franco and other countries of tho
entente might, until recently, have
been looked upon an tho tninfesta
tlon of a spirit that a rcnwonablo
peace treaty could overcome. Tho
idea in now apparently bo deeply
rooted in tho minds of individuals us
jo constitute a menaco that may re
sist any sort of a peaco trouty. The
only official action 'regarding trade
in tween citizens of Franco and tho
Central Empires, applies only to tho
period of hostilities. Prlvato Initia
tive, however, has gono far in tho
direction of a permanent ostracism
of nicrchnndis o from countries now
at war with Franco. If it continue?
to develop along tho same lines, it
muy make oiliclal action Huporfluous.

articles inado ut ;'iomo or by tho
French allies, but is organizing for
tho oventual -boycott with ou ardour
of initiative that was rare in French
business circles prior to 1014.' It
involves tho uyytematic education of
consumers as to what German ar
ticles and products they; bought bo
fore-the war without knowing it, and
what French, tirltish, Russian uhd

Starting with the characteritsic Pari
