Tho ineonsistency of the Chancellor's

"ignorninious surrender" advanced in
the note.

(From The Tribune Bureau.)
Washington, May 6.?A new appeal for peace from Fope
Benedict to President Wilson was delivored at tho White Ho-ne
to-day by the Papal Delegate, Monsignor Ciovanni Bonzano. The
Pope urged the President to maintain his neutrality and to do
his utmost by mediation to bring peace to Europe Coming only
twenty-four hours after the Orman note, in whieh similar hint-'

The President did not see Monsignor Bonzano and it is un

The PraadflVnt read with careful
attontion to-day the portion of the
note touching on peace. Unusual
sijrnifioanre was attached to that
part af the note because it was taken
to indicate offieial!y that recent
4.peocho'4 of Chancellor von Beth
, mann-Hollvr.ag bafora th,- Keirhstag
were iniend.'d as notices to the *vor ,|
that Germany was nady for rn-a,

The note says "The German G

It was thought to-day the Ger?
man note might pus-ibly draw forth
sofiu-thmg from the Allies. The
papal plea could wo!l pave the way
to such a course.

The I'opo'a plea, tahea in conneetinn
