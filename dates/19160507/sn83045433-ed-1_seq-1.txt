Germany's Reference to Peace Assert

Former Statements.
(By the International News Service.)
London, May 6.-Lord Rotert Ceuil.
minister of war. trade and blockade, to
night issued semi-officially a document
which may be described as the British
reply to the allegations in the German
note that th British government does
not ob's re fully the rules of interna
tional law as a belligerent nation in re
gard to the present blockade of ermany.
The statement in effect answers the
American declaration in the note of Feb-.
raary 11 that the blockade must be con
fined to torts on the coast.s of Great
Britain'0 enemies and avers that no neu
trals have suffered by the British activi
The sem:-official declaration Further
quotes precedents for the British action
in hiding foodstuffs intended fcr enemy
destination as contrahand. The semi-of
tlial statement in full follows:
Can Make No General Comment.
The reply of the German government
to the American note of April 20 respect
ing submarine warfare is not a communi
cation upon which any general comment
can properly be made in this country,
as the questions at Issue concern the
United States and Germany and any in
terference by a third party would be
presumptuous.
"Since. however, the German note oen

The German government states that

Aided by the telephone, telegraph, wire

mobilized the country's forces of com

By means of the mediums named Secre

desk, found himself able to talk with
every navy yard In the country, Atlantic

formal orders by telegraph to all of

side, or the coast of Europe on the
other.
Had it been necessary yesterday aft

of a naval battle, the pursuit of a com

any vessel of the presence of a hostile

In Anticipatic
Struggle on
By JOHN L. BALDER5TON.
(Cbyright, :916, by the Mceluy Newsisper
Syedicle.)
London, April 14.-For fifty-five days
the greatest artillery storm the world
has ever known has raged along the
heights of the M use, and in this bloodiest
of conflicts the Germans have already
lost in killed and wounded 190,000 men
according to the French headquarters
estimate, while the French losses, it is
safe to say, are not less than 90,000.
During this protracted struggle in
which 30,000 soldiers have fallen on a
front of twenty-five miles, a relative
silence has been maintained along the 54
miles which constitute the rest of the
trench lines from the sea to Switzer.

Paris, May G-Coincident with the re

note, the Verdun battle has leaped up
with for greater fierceness than has
characterized it any time since February.
A terrific tornado of crplosive and
poison shells deluges Mort Homme, and
Hill 304 and during the past couple of
days the crown prince has launched sev
eral divisions of his finest remaining
troops (who, during the last few days
have been strongly reinforced) against
Hill 304, which is two and one half miles
southwest of Mort Homme and 1,000 yards
southeast of Haucourt.
The object of this great onslaught was
to turn the French at Mort Homme and
force a general retreat in this region.
Unspeakably awful was the bombard
ment of 11111 304, which was followed by
six infantry attacks all of which were
repulsed, except the last one, when the
Germans succeeded in obtaining a foot.

Everywhere else in this section the
