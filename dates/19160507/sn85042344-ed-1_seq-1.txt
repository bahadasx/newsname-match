U. S. WILL AGAIN
AWAIT THE NEXT
GERMAN ACTION
411 Serene Unless There
Should Be Further At
tacks on Ships.
OFFICIAL VERSION
OF NOTE RECEIVED
Wilson Is Displeased at
Language and Conditions
Imposed Therein.
WASHINGTON, May 6. The
probability that a diplomatic
break with Germany has been avert
ed, at least temporarily, was strength
ened today when the official text of
the German note laid before Presi
dent Wilson and Secretary Lansing
was found to be almost identical with
the unofficial version sent to the
Vnited States in press dispatches.
Officials had indicated that should
the official text bear out the unoffi
cial version, they thought it Improb
able diplomatic relations would have
to be severed unless there should be
further attacks upon merchunt ships
in violation of the new pledges given.
Disappointment has been indicated,
however, over certain features of the
Ucrmun reply and high officials be
lieve It at least cannot be accepted
unconditionally. The president and
Secretary Lansing studied the text
carefully today.
Opinion as to whether the note re
quires an answer seems divided. De
cision, of course, rests with the
president and until he has made up
his mind, it Is unlikely an officials
expression of opinion will he forth
coimng. So far he has not indicated
to any one his final Judgment in the
matter.
Xo Reply at Present.
It Is entirely possible that no reply
will bo sent for the present at least
nnd that the president will malntnin
silence for a time, allowing Germany
to demonstrate on her own behalf the
good faith of her Intention to carry
out the policy indicated In her now
orders to submarine commanders.
Although the president realizes that
the promises given are the cardinal
elements of the note, he is under
stood to be displeased over the
language used and the conditions ap
parently attached.
Should the note be acepted as satis,
factory and a reply sent, it is expected
to take the form of notification to
Germany- that the United States has
derided not to sever diplomatic rela
tions so long as the new submarine
orders rcmuin effective and are ob
served. Can't Doiint Good Faith.
The only indication regarding the
personal attitude of President Wilson
was obtained today from persons close
to affairs of the White House, who
described his as feeling himself in a
position where ho could not question
Germany's good faith, unless the
declaration made by the German gov
ernment should not prove effective.
Count von Bernstorff, the German
ambassador, returned to Washington
today from New York. Ho said ho had
no instructions from his government
to discuss the situation with Secretary
Ionising and that he did not Intend to
go to the state department unless he
should he so instructed by Berlin or
Secretary Lansing should Invite him
to call. Officials would not be sur
prised, however. If the ambassador
should be instructed to call upon Sec
retary Lansing next week after he and
president Wilson have had sufficient
time to reach conclusions.
Text Mado Public
The officlul text of the German
note was made public today by the
state department. Ambassador Ger
ard in transmitting the document said
he had received copies in both Ger
man and English. A slight difference

Carranza's upprovul of tho
Scolt-Obrcgon ugri-ement still wus
lacking tonight, delaying formal lat
Iflrution of the plan for co-operative
action drawn up by the two officers
in their conference at the border.
Neither the war nor stute depart
ment had received any dispatches
bearing on the attitude of the do
facto government and the Mexican
embassy also was without Informa
tion. Negotiations for a formal protocol
covering the subject of the expedi
tion la expected to be resumed here
after tho Scntt-Obregon agreement
hius been ratified. While the latter
deals with the military features it
is thought necessnry to work lit
diplomatic features through regulur
diplomatic channels. General Car
ranza's note of April 12 suggesting
that discussion of the withdrawal of
the American forces bo taken up,
suspended negotiations then in prog
ress for a protocol. If these are
to be resumed the ground will have

of the border agreement.
SOCIALISTS MARCH
IN SOLID PHALANX
Report That Only 1,000
Voters in State Have
Yet to Register.
S)fi-il to Thf World
OKLAHOMA CITY, May 6. Pat
Naglo, who is assisting in tho
campaign of registering for the So
cialists of tho stale, said today that
not more than ono thousand Socialists
had yet to ho registered, so thorough
is their organization and so systematic
had the registration beon conducted
In that party slnco the registration
commenced. Ho predicted that the
registration would bo largely in excess
of tho vole polled by the Socialists In
1914, which wus thon fifty thousand.
This means tliut the registration will
amount to something like sixty thou
sand or sixty-five thousand In the
state. Speaking of the campaign, Mr.
Nugle suld that he would not be sur
prised If the Socialist delegation In
the next legislature would number
more than twenty members.
In tho opinion of some of the mem
bers of the Socialist party this Is a
fight between the Democrats and So
cialists and not so much between tho
Republicans and Democrats. And the
fight of the Socialists is not on the
rank and file of the Democratic party

the homes of voters, regadless of pol
itics, registering many who would not
otherwise take the iroublo to look up
the registrar. Tho Republican vote
in many precincts exceeds that of two
years ago, and this is accounted for
liy reuson of many former Demo
crats coming out openly and declar
ing for the Republican cause from
national ticket to county. Indica
tions are thai the Socialist vote will
be double that of two years ago, this
being made up from disgruntled
Democrats who will not vote the Re
publican ticket and are disgusted
with state and national affairs oa
conducted by the Democrats. Tre So
