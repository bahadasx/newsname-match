vass. All who wish to vote at the I

atioo to the registration officer; to

Registration for state and county
elections opened Monday and the

' ft to Cochise county people
The books will be open until 5

then uneil September 18 when thev

October 15
Who May Register
All persons qualified should regis
ter at this time as their previous
registration will not permit of their
voting at the coming primary and
general election. The qualifications
of electors are as follows Must be
21 years of age or over; a citizen of
the I'nlted States either by birth
or naturalization, a resident of Ari
zona for one y-ar prior to the elec
tion and of the county and precinct
for 0 days, must be able to read Ihe
Constitution of the United States In
the English language and write his
o- her name, unless physically unable
to do so
The last state legislature amended
the registration law so as to require
that each elector must state his or
her party affiliation If a person
ahould refuse to state his political
reference he cannot be registered,
according to an opinion given by
'kttorney General Wiley .Tones
However, if an elector should state
that he is afiiliated with no political
"arty, he may be registered But,
such an elector would not be eligible
to vote in the primary for any can
didate whose name appears on anv
of the party ballots Thus it will be
seen that this voter could not par
Democrat, or Socilalst primaries
Some confusion exists regarding
the qualification of foreign born wo-
herself be lawfully naturalized, shall
naturalization law- covers this point
Foreign Born Women.
""Any woman who is now or may
hereafter be married to a citizen of
the United States and who might
herself be lawfully natturalized, shall
be deemeed a citizen "
"That any foreign woman who ac
quires American citizenship by mar
riage to an American shall be as
sumed to retain the same after the
term of the martial relation, if she
continues to reside ln the United
States unless, she makes formal re
nunciation thereof before a court hav
ing jurisdiction to naturalize aliens
or if she resides abroad, she may
retain her citizenship by registering
as such before a United States con
sul within one year after the terml
nation of such martial relation.
"That an American woman who
marrl-s a foreigner shall take the
nationality ofher husband At the
termination of the martial relation
she may- resume her American citi
zenship. If abroad, by registering as
an American citizen within one year
with a consul of the United States, or
by returning to reside In the United
States at the termination of the mar
tial relation, by continuing to rerlce
there.

Batchelder are the two registration
officers for the Tombstone precinct
and they report a large number al
ready registered.
At the affice of County Recorder
Murphy a force is busy receiving
the registrations from all precincts
in the county and entering them up
on the register. Already the regis
trations are coming In fast, which
will greatly lessen the work on that
office. It Is nrged that all registra
tion officers ln the county see that
registrations are secured early, there
by avoiding the rush during the last
days on which the books are open.
