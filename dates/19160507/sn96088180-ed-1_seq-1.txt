SAYS ENGLISH
ARE
DECADENT RACE
Seattle." May 6. "The English are
a decadent race, and the knell has
sounded for them as a great nation."
After ten months In the British
Held hospital service of northern
France, Dr. Waldo Richardson, au
American surgeon, has Just returned
to Seattle with that firm conviction.
"I went to Kurope decidedly pro
Hrltlsh," he snld, "hut I have come
hack virtually neutral. I saw enough
at the front, In the trcuches and hos
pitals to eradicate every favorable
prejudice I had entertained for the
English.
'As flKhtlng men they have not
lived up to their traditions. In the
hospitals the wounded bnve shown
how little resistance tho Londoners
have. And as allies they have not
won the respect of the French.
"And I believe from all the evi
dence I saw at the front that her
colonies will divorce England when
this period of horror has passed,
Canada and Australia, almost cer
tainly. "The Canadians have been openly
disdainful and even hostile to the
English officers, whose bombast has
made enemies Instead of friends
among the allies.
"The colonial British, however, the
Canadians and Australians, are mag
nificent men and splendid fighters,
Imbued with a sportsmanship and
democracy entirely foreign to their
Island countrymen,
"Ot all the warriors In Europe to
day I should place the Canadians
first and the Germans second. Tbe
French. are splendid when they are
winning, but become despondent
when losing."
Dr. Richardson was stationed for
a time at the Etablea hospital base
of the British. Thousands ot wound
ed came under his personal care. He
believes the war will end In a draw,
Germany losing

SUBMARINE ATTACK UPOw
ISSUE NOW VERDUN IS
CLOSED RENEWED
No Statement From the White
House, But President's Ad
visers Consider Question
As Finally Disposed 01
Washington, May 6. Tbe submar
ine Issue Is eloawl, In tbe view f
President Wilson's advisers today.
No comment was forthcoming from
the White House. So completely do
officials in touch with the situation
consider the issue disposed of that
it waa said there would be no reply
by the president.
Secretary Lansing may issue a
statement calling attention to tbe
essential point that Germany order
ed its submarine activities confined
to vessels of war. This Is the essence
ot the reply, officials say, and leaves
no actual Issues.
Tbe issue will remain closed, It Is
believed. It Is felt that Germany
will not reopen tbe case by resuming
Its undersea warfare against merch
ant vessels. Officials believe every
care will be taken to prevent com
manders from violating their Instructions,-
and see danger only in
the fact that submarine commanders
are mostly young, and some of them
perhaps difficult to control.
Rut Germany having once quit sub
marining merchant men, no high bf
flclal regards it within the range of
possibility that she will resume such
operations.
