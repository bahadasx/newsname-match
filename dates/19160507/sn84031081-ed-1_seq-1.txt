sutimarine orders remain effective j
and are observed.
Several members of the cabinet
Were not in Washington today. Bee-1
retary Lansing left tonight to spend j
ttt week-end at Annapolis, taking
with him an official copy of the Ger
man note. He expects to have fully
iliitested its statements by the time of
his return Monday.
President's Attitude. I
The only indication regarding th" I
personal attitude of President Wilson '
was obtained today from persons close i
in the affairs of the White House,
who described him as feeling in a po-1
sition where he could not question I
qerntany's good faith, unless the dec-!
kuatlona made by Ihe German gov-
ernment should not prove effective.

Secretary Lansing, uiid that he did i

should invite him to call. Officials '
wnuld not be surprised, however, if
the ambassador should be instructed
W call upon Secretary ljinsing next
week, after he and President Wilson
had sufficient time to reach conclu
sions. Slight Difference Noted.
The official text of the German note
was made public today by the state
department. Ambassador Gerard, in
transmitting the document, said he
had received copies in both German
and English, probably accounting for
'ne official and unofficial versions
wing so nearly identical. A slight
difference in the text occurs in the
Paragraph where the unofficial ver
"lon says that German "has decided
jo make further a concession adapt
mg the methods of warfare to inter
j'Ns of neutrals." In the official text
BM words "in adopting" appear in
of the word "adapting." An
other difference has to do With an
"mission probably due to an error in
0Me transmission, the words in the
unofficial version "several attempts
made by the government of the Unit
Jd States to prevail upon" preceding

Inc identally, also, Heneral nbregon Is
said to have been taking a telegraphic
poll of the sentiments towards the

! pa, Mexico, May t! (By Wlrless to 00
I iiimbus, N. M.I A full squadron of
III men of the Klevcnth cavalry stir
i prised and routed a much larger force
of Villistas at itjo Annies, within sev
enteen miles of Cuslhiilruehic, early
yesterday.
j By actual count forty-two Mexicans
were killed and a number wounded,
but there were no American casual
ties. The command, under Major Robert
I Howse, had been pursuing the Vil
listas under Generals Cruz Domlnguez
and Julio Aoosta, for several (lays,
when they snCOU ft tSrad them yester
day, encamped In the huddled adobo
Jacals on OJo A.ules. The Mexicans
Were utterly surprised and sprang

firing a few wild shots they began n
disorganized flight, each man shifting
for his own safety Some of them
were able to seize their horses, al
ready Jaded from a hard day pre
viously, but others made their way
into the hills afoot.
In Major Howse's report he said the
rout had been absolute, and that he
was still pursuing the scattered rem
nant of the band. The band engaged
Is the largest remaining under the
Villa standard, and yesterday's de
cisive victory gave much satisfaction
to nillltury men here.
While the dispatches do not state,
military men on the border believe
that the band engaged Is the same as
that defeated at Temochtc, April 22,
by Col George A. Dodd's command.
The Howse column struck the bund
of Mexicans neur oJoh Azules after an
all night cross-rountry ride at 5:45
Thursday morning. The outposts of
the Mexicans fired on them. Tho
troopers charged, scattering the Mexi
cans, many of whom had been sleep
ing nnd were only partly dressed.
Most of them fled on foot, leaving
thi Ir horses. More than fifty of thu
fugitives were rounded up by Ameri
cans after the engagement.
The column had niuched thirty-six
miles through the mountains during
the night and made the attack with
out stopping to rest either men or
horses. It consisted of six picked
troops of the Bleventh cuvalry and
one machine gun detachment.
