plain that "neutrals cannot expert

So plainly does Germany put the
case that it will not only
abandon but will not even restrict
the use of the submarine until the
United States takes issue against
the alloged illegal operations of
Great Britain that in the opinion
of the east the declaration of the

No Reason Why Governor
Should Not Enter Contett.
The btlirf th'it Theodore (',. lit :!..
Will be a randidnt against J.nn K.
Vardaman for hi sent in the United
States Serate seems to be daily
grown. g in strength, and the ( 'larks
dale correspondent of the Iuret
ledger has recently sent his
paper a communication in which the
situation is succinctly reviewed.
The correspondent quotes from sev
eral Mississippi newspapers, notable
among them beins: The Issue, which
is controlled by Bilbo and which is
therefore generally regarded ai his
official mouthpiece. The article pub
lished in tha Ledger follows:
Every now and then the rumor
gains circulation that the governor
will enter the senatorial race against
Vardaman, but no word to this ef
fect has been vouchsafed by the
governor. In fact he is silent on this
question and when asked by his
friends as to whether it is his inten
tion to make the race, he shrugs
his shoulders and smiles and says:
"Let them (meaning the public)
guess."
But the probabilities are that Gov.
Bilbo will run for the United States
Senate against James K. Vardaman,
because there is no reason why he
should not. Bilbo is under no obliga
tions to Vardaman at least not to
that extent where it is visible to,
the public eye, the senator remain
ing extremely quiet during the last
election In -which Bilbo us roagMyt
handled by his opponent.
If there is any obligation between
the two it rests on Vardaman, for
it was a Herculena work Bilbo did
for him when he went over the
state in his so-called exposure of
the secret caucus. Bilbo may not
have elected Vardaman but he cer
tainly contributed more to his polit
ical success than nny other man in
Mississippi.
The Biloxi Daily Herald says
there is no reason why Bilbo should
not run against Vardaman while
there ure reasons why htf should.
He is young, ambitious and polit
ically popular and if he makes a
iaccess of his administration he
ill be one of the strongest men in
Ute state. He will in all probabil
ity run, because there is nothing
?lse left for him to do if he would
make politics a career. But per
haps the overmastering reason is
that he can meet Vardaman on any
stumping ground, give him us much
as he W'ill receive and in all likeli
hood come out victorious.
No man would deliberately turn
his back on the United States Sen
ate, and that is precisely what Gov
ernor Bilbo would do were he to re
fuse to enter the race four years
hence.
Now, let us see if there is any
thing on which can be hinged a pre
diction that Bilbo will be a candi
date when the time comes to make
the race.
The Issue, published in Jackson,
admittedly speaks for the govern
or, and in the last number is found
the following editorial:
"Woodrow Wilson has spoken like
a man; he reflects the American
character in his address to Congress
on the German crisis and the Amer
ican people rejoice that this kind of
man is at the head of their govern
ment. The President has acted
throughout this controversy with
Germany with rare patience, pru
dece and consideration; he has done
nothing precipitately or for the sake
of making a noise; he has not been
influenced by clamor of anykind;
he has given no thought whatever
to any incident of political expe
diency; he has earnestly sought the
way of right and justice and hu
manity, and if this has led to a
crisis, then the American people
are ready to meet it whatever the
cost.

relations must reflect the character
