INCREASE
Much Difference in Opinion as
to Cause for Big Tax Jump
in This State.
SXAFISTICS ON TAXES
FOR ALL PURPOSES
'as Been Remarkable
During the Early Years of
State.
Much liatf%i&n 'printed in the news
papers of the state during the past
three or four years concerning the
increase in the taxes in North Dakota.
iMuch .speculation has been indulged
in by various newspaper writers and
editors as to the responsibility for
this increase. That there has been
such an increase is admitted even by
the most casual observer of current
affairs, hut as to the cause responsible
for the increase there is a marked
difference of opinion. When there is
a marked increase in the tax bills for
any year, the average property own­
er at once turns his attention to the
state government and seeks there for
the cause of the increased tax burden.
The state government operates in the
white light of publicity—every news­
paper of state-wide circulation and
many local papers are at great pains
and expense to obtain information con­
cerning the conduct of the state gov
eminent, while the local subdivisions,
the counties, cities, townships and
school dsitricts, operate with very lit­
tle attention being paid to their af­
fairs. (Not only do the newspapers
often fail to obtain the simplest in­
formation concerning local subdivis­
ions, but even the most aggressive and
•wide-awake citizen, does not endeav­
or to inform himself concerning local
matters.
That the tax burden in North Da­
kota has increased with considerable
rapidity is indicated by the following
compilation which contains the total
tax for. all purposes,, state and local,
~^©r-the-yeaj* indicated
Total Tax for
I.. All Purposes State Tax
Year State and Local Levy
1890 2.3S6.540 $ 427,629
1913 12,888,853 1,365,918
1914 13,987,476 1,323,167
1915 15*860,132 1,611,639
While it is of interest to note the
total tax levy in 1890 was $2,336,540
and that by 1915 it had increased to
$15,860,132 and that the total increase
during this period of twenty-three
years was 413 per cent, yet when we
consider the increase during the past
three years, from 1913 to 1915 inclus­
ive, we find that it amounts to but
32 mills. In other words, during the
twenty-three years prior to 1913, the
average increase in the total tax bur­
den of the state since statehood was
18 per. cent, while during the past
three years it has been but 10.7 per
cent.
While it is also interesting to note
that the state tax increased from
$427,629 in 1®90 to $1,333,462 in 1912,
or 212 oer cent, and during the past
three years it has increased to $1,
611,639 or.21 per cent. In other words
during the twenty-three years of
statehood to December 31st, 1912,
there was an average increase per
year in the taxes levied for state pur­
poses of .9.2 per cent, while during
the past three years from 'December
ii?1st, 1912 to December 31st, 1915,
there was an average increase per
year in the taxes levied for state gov­
ernment of 7 per cent.
That the portion of taxes paid for
state purposes, show a constant de­
crease as compared with the tax$
paid for all purposes is indicated 'by
the fact that in 1890, 17.16 per cent
of all taxes paid for all purposes were
paid for state purposes. Five years
later it was 15 per cent in 1890 it
was almost 16 per cent in 190f it was
14.54 per cent in 1910 it was 12.25
per cent in'1912 it was 11.12 per cent
in 1913 it was 10.50' per cent in 1914
it was 9.47 per cent, and in 1915 it
was 10.16 per cent. It will be observ­
ed that during the past three years
the portion of all taxes used for state
purposes was less than at any time
during statehood. The lowest year
being that of 1914.
The rate of levy for all purposes,
state, county, city, school and town­
ship, has increased from 26.2 mills in
18&0 to 42.3 mills in 1915, while the
total valuation of the state has in­
creased from $8®,8i96,291 in 1890 to
$374,71)9,by* in li15. Turning to the
state levy we find an entirely different
tale. In 1890 the state levy -was 4.5
mills, while in 1915 it was 4.3 mills.
It is also to be noted that the years
H914 and 1916 were the only times
in the history of the state when a
legal state levy has been made. All
other years except 1892 the levy has
been in excess of the limit fixed (by
the constitution.
The general fund out of which is
paid the current expenses of the state
government tells the same story. We
begun statehood with a levy for the
general fund of 4 mills. In 1913 we
reached the low point in the history
of the state being 2J876 mills, while
for the years 1914 and 1915 it was 3
mills.

Approval.
ALL BIG PROPERTY
OWNERS FAVOR PROJECT
•Bismarck is prepared to "pave" the
way for a brilliant future. The almost
unanimous support which the Com­
mercial club has received for the 12
mile paving project is encouraging.
The second week of the campaign
closes with every large property
holder in iHismarck, with not more
than a-half dozen exceptions, enroll­
ed in favor of promoting I he capital
city interests. Among the heavy tax­
payers who have volunteered enthusi­
astic support to the movement during
the last week are: John Satterlund
of Washburn, a booster for the whole
Missouri Slope country, and first, af­
ter his home town, for 'Bismarck,
where he has interests J. K. Hoag
land, one of the oldest of Bismarck's
large real estate owners- John 'Whal­
en of Minneapolis the Bismarck Gro­
cery Co., St. Mary's Church and Pa
rochial School, Bishop Vincent AVehi
le, Rev. Father Hiltner, Sister iM. Bon­
iface, the Bismarck and St. Alexius
hospitals, practically every church
board in iBismarck, the Gamble-Rob
inson iFruit Co.. the Bismarck E'oard
of Education, Joseph Hare, and a
number of the largest and oldest es­
tates in the city.
Wires Approval.
.John (Whalen, when he heard of the
movement, could not wait to write,
but wired the Commercial club: "I
heartily approve of the paving propo­
sition," and it is intimated that after
the paving project goes through, Mr.
Whalen will return to his first love
and again become an active, con­
structive citizen of Bismarck. He
has, it is hinted, large investments in
view for his home city, as a result of
the progress and enterprise which it
is now displaying.
If a full meeting of the city commis­
sion is held tomorrow evening, it is
probable that the petitions, represent­
ing a majority of all the property
owners in the capital city, will be pre­
sented for informal approval. There
is an earnest demand upon the part
of everyone who has signed the peti­
tions that there be no delay. If Bis­
marck is to prove to the state legis­
lature next winter that it means busi­
ness, it must have at least the down­
town portion of the city paved. There
is no logical reason, it is urged, and
there certainly would be little logic,
it is contended, in deferring for an­
other year an improvement whose
benefits the business district, at least,
may as well begin enjoying this fall.
To Attract Industries.
There are now hanging fire projects
of far-reaching importance to Bis­
marck, whose consummation will de­
pend upon the immediate approval of
the paving issue. The enterprises con­
templated will bring into Bismarck
far more capital than will be involved
in the paving of every street in the
city. They may wait another year.
It is far more probable that if Bis­
marck fails to come to the scratch
now, but permits 'Minot. and Mandan
to outstrip it in so common-sense an
economy as paving that these con­
cerns, ready to invest now, will not
delay.
lE'ismarck, in the opinion of every­
one who has signed the paving peti­
tions, never has and never will under­
take an improvement of such vital
and far-reaching effects upon all. con­
cerned. The psychological moment,
everyone who has kept touch with
Bismarck's progress during the past
five years feels, is the present. The
moment has arrived for the capital
city to determine whether it will con­
tinue to drift with the high tide of
prosperity which has advanced Bis­
marck so wonderfully within the past
few years, or whether it. will put forth
a strong oar, take advantage of the
current, and swing into the middle of
the stream.
Just now people who have their all
invested in Bismarck and whose fate
is inseparably linked with the futre
of the capital city urge for Bismarck
the adoption of Chicago's famed slo­
gan. "I WILL."
marck Tribune has selected as
the medium to set at the presidential
preference for this section of the
state.
It is to be hoped that' the readers
of The Tribune will take an interest
in this poll and send in their prefer­
ence.

One year ago tomorrow morning,
May 8, 1916, the steamship Lusitania,
bound from New York to Liverpool,
was sunk without warning by a Ger­
man submarine, off Old Head of Kin
sale, Ireland, with a loss of the lives
of 1,150 non-combatants. One hund­
red and fourteen Americans were in­
cluded in this death list This preci­
pitated a crisis with United
States, which has not: yet been entire­
ly cleared up to the satisfaction of
the two countries concerned.
This date is important in the pres­
ent critical situation as it was the
first act leading to the crisis that is
now imminent. On February 18, 1915,
Germany began sinking unarmed
merchantmen in the so-called war
zone, despite the protest of neutrals.

real.
The supposed highwayman, Lieut.

handbag from a police matron, who
was playing the part' of a shopper,
had been pursued by patrolmen and
police dogs and surrounded. While
he police were pretending to over­
power him, the detective rushed in

London, May G.—Declining to com­
ment on the purely American-German
question involved in the German re­
ply to the American note on submar­
ine warfare, Lord Robert Cecil, min­
ister of war trade, and parliamentary
under-secretary for foreign affairs, In
behalf of the foreign office, gave the
Associated Press today a statement
dealing with the charges against
Great Britain and Germany's avowed
desire for peace.
The statement follows:
Would Be Presumptuous.
"The reply of the German govern­
ment to the American note of April
20. respecting submarine warfare, is
not a communication upon which any
general comment' can properly bo
made in this country, as the question
at issue concerns the United States
and Germany and any interference by
a third power would be presumptuous.
"Since, however, the German note
contains certain misstatement of fact,
respecting the actions of Great Brit­
ain, may be not thought out of place.
The German government states that
if has, so far as possible, instituted a
far-reaching restraint upon the use of
the submarine weapon solely in con­
sideration of neutrals' interests and
in spite of the fact that these restric­
tions were necessarily of advantage
to Germany's enemies.
No Consideration Shown.
It is alleged that no such consider­
ation has ever '-on shown to neu­
trals by Great Britain and her allies.
"Do the facts bear out this asser­
tion? So far as the measures taken
by/ threat"
trade have cost no neutral life, Great
Britain maintains that they are in ac
cordatice with the international tew
and are ready to make good that
claim. The Germans maintain that it
was owing to the illegal condition of
war fare by Great Britain that she
was forced to resort to submarine
warfare campaign. This is not thef
first time Germany has attempted to
justify her warfare on the ground
that it is a method of reprisal of the
British government in cutting off sup­
plies from the German government.
Sees Conflict in Statements.
"The German government speaks
of many millions of women and child­
ren who, according to the avowed in­
tention of the British government,
are to bo starved and who, by their
sufferings, shall force the armies of
the Central powers into an ignomt
nous capitulation. In this connection
it is interesting to remember that at
the beginning of the last month, the
German chancellor made the follow­
ing remark in the Reichstagg: 'That
in 1015 the enemy would not give up
the hope of starving Germany, but' I
cannot understand how cool heads
can cling to it after the experience
of 1915. Our enemies forget that
thanks to the organization powers of
the whole nation, Germany Is equal
to the task of distribution of victuals.
Our stocks of bread and grain will
not only be sufficient hut will leave
an ample reserve with which to com­
mon ce the new year. We have not
run short of anything in the past nor
shall we run short of anything in the
future.'"
BELIEVED BREAK HAS
BEEN AVERTED
Washington, May 6.—The probabil­
ity that a diplomatic break with Ger­
