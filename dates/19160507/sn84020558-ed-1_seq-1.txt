republican eonvention. Cameron lost
the state republican nomination to
the convention on a subse'iuent mo
tion by a vote of 131 to 9.",.
Even the most optimistic support
ers of Colonel Roosevelt conceded
that the Arizona delegation, as con
stituted in caucuses following the mo
tion to redistrict is hopeless. Of the
six, but one is known to be in any
wise favorably disposed toward Col
onel Roosevelt.
Although not h I!oose(1t man.
Cameron's strength lay chiefly among
the progressives. Tied up by the
unit rule in at least two counties,
Cameron lost scattering votes, but
nut enough to have won for him.
Stand pat leaders agreed after ad
journment that had the combination
of progressive votes been permitted,
by means of the desperate trades at
tempted during the early part of the
session, the result might have leen
different.
At 10; 15 o'clock Secretaire Thomas
Maddock, of the State Central com
mittee, called the delegates to order
and paid this was the largest anil
most enthusiastic body of republi

raid the mistake of F'H, when one
lrpublicnn was placed in the presi
dency and another in the supreme
court, was about to be corrected. He
then recognized Joe Kleindienst, of
Navajo, and the morning session was
officially placed on the skids. Klein
dienst moved the selection of Judge
Sloan for chairman. This was car
ried by a vivu, voce vote, .Maricopa,
voting aye. In accordance with the
agreement reached in the !i o'clock
caucus. Thomas Campbell and J.
Lorenzo llubbell were named to es
cort Judge Sloan to the chair. Cheer
ing was prolonged as Judge Sloan
tiok his place. Sloan opened his key
note speech by putting Maricopa
county in the clear as regards his se
lection, lie said he hoped that as
outside counties had supported hini
for the chairmanship, this would not
be held to embarrass Maricopa in
anything they might want to put lie
fore the convention. Judge Sloan pre
dicted party success in the fall. "We
are not a mere party of opposition."
be suid. A distinct thread of amia
bility toward the Roosevelt men was
found in his ' succeeding remarks, in
which he said the Republicans stood
for a reasonable protective tariff,
Americanism, real preparedness and a
definite stand both on questions of
foreign and Mexican policies. Amer
icanism is a characteristic of the
republican irty. said the Judge. He
touched very lightly on state issues,
merely saying he hoped there would
be a subordination of personal de
sires to the good of the party.
Secretary Elected
Tracey Curtis, of Nogales, was
made secretary of the temporary or
ganization, and the convention pro
ceeded to the naming of three com
mittees. Of" course, the names had
been handed the chairman during the
forenoon by the various county lead
ers, so the matter was mere for

LOXIX IN, May ii. -Declining to
coinirii-nt on the purely American
German questions involved in the
German reply to the American note
on submarine warfare, Lord Robert
Cecil, minister of war trade, and par
liamentary under-secretary for for
eign affairs, in behalf of the foreign
office, gave the Associated Press to
day a statement dealing with the
charges against Great Britain and
Germany's avowed desire for peace.
The statement follows:
"The reply of the German govern
ment to the American note of April
it), respecting submarine warfare, is
not a, communication upon which any
general comment can properly be
made in this country, as the ques
tions at issue concern the Cnited
States and Germany, and any inter-feiei-.ce
by a third party would lie
presumptuous.
"Since, however, the German note
contains certain misstatements of fact
respecting the actions of Great Bri
tain the following observations may
not be thought out of place: The
German government states that they
have, so far as is possible, instituted
i far-reaching restraint upon the use
of the submarine when solely in con
sideration of neutral interests and in
spite of the fact that tlnse restric
tions were necessarily of advantage,
to German'. 's enemies.
"It is alleged that no such i

WASHINGTON. Hay ti. The prob
ability that a diplomatic break with
Germany has been averted, at least
temjiorarily, was strengthened today
when the official text of the German
note. laid before President Wilson and
Secretary Lansing, was found to be al
most identical with the unofficial ver
sion sent to the United States in the
press dispatches.
Officials said that should the of-
f foodstuffs ficial text bear out tne unofficial ver
sions they thought it improbable dip
lomatic relations would have to be
severed, unless there should be fur
ther attacks upon merchant ships in
violation of the new pledges given.
Disappointment has been indicated
however, over certain features of the
German reply and some hitdi officials
believe that it at least cannot be ac
cepted unconditionally. The president
Hies in At - j and Secretary Lansing studied the text
them from I carefully today, going very minutely
over the phraseology and shades of
meaning that might be attached to
various expressions.
Opinion as to whether the Hole re
quires an answer seems divided. I.ic
cision rests with the president, and
until he has made up nis mind, it is
unlikely that an official expression of
opinions will be fori "coming. So far
he has not indicated to anyone his final
in the matter.

WASHINGTON, May 8. A message J Ut ep interest among officials here.
from Pope Benedict to President Wil
son was delivered at the White House
today by Monsignor Giovanni Bozano,
the apostolic delegate.
Fear that a break between the Uni
ted States and Germany would Im
pair the ability of the United States
lo aid in restoring peai e in Europe is
said also to have influenced Poe
Benedict in communicating with the
President. The message, taken in con
nection with the suggestion in Oer

The pope. like President Wilson, is un
derstood to be ready to make peace,
suggestions when he believes the time
is ripe.
Up to th present so far as could be
learned tonight thero has been no In
timation from the allied governments
that peace overtures would be wel
j coined. President Wilson consistently
hos laken the position that he could
not, with piopriety take further media
tion offers unless all parties to the
war were ready to discuss the subject.
