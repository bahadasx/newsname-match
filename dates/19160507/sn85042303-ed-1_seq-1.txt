and fifty men, surprised and
routed a much larger force of
bandits seventeen miles South

ters here today.
' The Americans who were un
der Major Howze, made a
night ride of thirty-six miles
from San 'Antonio to surprise
the bandits.
There were no American
casualties.
The Villistas arrived at Ojo
azules, the night before the
fight with the Americans and
tried to take the town from the
Carranza garrison. Meeting
with resistance the bandits de
tided to wait until morning.
The Americans arrived shortly
before dawn.
Five of the Carrancistas who
were being held for execution
by the bandits, were released.

El Paso, Tex.,' May 6 No final ad

up to a late hour this afternoon, but
Obregon believes the final conference
with Scott will be held tonight.
It was announced today that Scott
and Funston expect to hold their final
conference with Obregon this even
ing, at which the American sugges
tions for co-operating in the disposal
of the Villa bands are expected to take
the form of a signed protocol.
Prior to the time for the conference,
however came reports from Juarez
which were not quite so optimistic
because Carranza was reported de
sirous of discussing further the ques
tion of withdrawal of the American
troops. The American representat
ives say there will be absolutely no
change in Washington's attitude.

FRIDAY WAS
T
WHEN MORE THAN NINETY GAVE
THEIR NAMES AS CONVERTS
DR. WILLIAMS DELIVERED A
STRONG MESSAGE.
Friday at the tabernacle was the
biggest day. More than ninety came
forward and gave their names as
converts.
In the afternoon the ward schools
were in attendance, more than six
hundred strong. Dr. Williams gav.j
them an especially strong message
and at the call for converts the aisles
were thronged with eager seekers. It
was a beautiful service, and one
never to be forgotten.
In the evening the High school
came in a body, with their teachers,
wiUi banners waving, singing as they
marched. They were filled with en
thusiasm and cheer after cheer greet
ed them, and these were returned
by the students in their loudest tones.
The entire half of the choir plat
form was occupied by the Boost er-i,
who san;; at their best.
Dr. Williams chose for his text
for the third time, "How Shall We
Escape If We Neglect So Great Sal
vation?" This time las emphasis was all
placed uiwn the one word, "neglect."
He illustrated by U-ilmg tne legend
of the council in hell, when Satan
was troubled over a great revival
going on in a certain place in the
world.
BANNER DAY AT
ABEHCLE
One imp volunteered to go and
spread the doctrine that there is no
God and the bible is a myth. But
Satan shook his head.
Another volunteered to tell men
that God was too good to let anyone
suffer.
A third proposed to go and te'.l
people that there was no hurry wait
a while the young must have their
fun first, and men must attend to
business and become Christians at a
more convenient season. He was the
one whom the devil sent with his
blessing and good wishes.
Neglect Is dangerous in the affairs
of life.
It a merchant neglects his busi
ness he will fall.
A doctor who fails to answer calls
of patients promptly, is soon dropped.
A lawyer who neglects his studies
and his clients will soon have no
clients to serve.
Why should people be different in
religious affairs?
Why neglect heavenly things for
the earthly. Earthly success is soon
forgotten, and forgotten forever. How
insignificant are the pleasures of this
world compared to the pleasures of
Christianity? No really safe and sane
and wholesome pleasure is denied
the Christian. Some pleasures are
doubtful and dangerous, and would
be tetter given up.
Dr. Williams made a very stirring
appeal to the youth and many cams
forward for re-consecratlon, while
