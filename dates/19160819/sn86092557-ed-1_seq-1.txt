WEST VIRGINIA
Local Doctors Ask State
Health Commission to
Act.
While infantile paralysis is a real
danger and may spread to West Vir
ginia yet city Health Officer Dr. Ches
ney Raraage statod today that the like
lihood of an outbreak in Fairmont is
rather remote. Both Dr. Ramage and
county physician Dr. L. N. Yost havo
taken all possible precautions to pre
vent the spread of the diseaso to this
region and have asked Dr. Jepson, the
state health commissioner to quaran
tine the state. In this action the lo
cal officials are acting with the health
officials of Clarksburg, Grafton and
Morgantown.
Since the Pennsylvania quarantine
has become effective children under
16 years of ago are not permitted to
go from West Virginia into that state
without a certificate of health. Penn
sylvania children however may come
to West Virginia now and no
means are at hand to prevent the dis
ease from being carried into the state.
It is thought that the entire state of
West Virginia can be quarantined suc
cessfully for about $1,000 per day.
To quarantine Fairmont would cost
approximately $50 per day and any
local quarantine would be of little val
ue.
Infantile paralysis is dreaded be
cause of the fact that medical science
can do but little to alleviate the mala
dy. DeathB from measles alone reach
ten times the number from paralysis
each year in the United States.

Abandon Plan to Beg or Steal
An Auto for Red Cross Nurse
Fall Back Upon Tried and
True Methods of Raising
the Coin.
Ways of securing a new Ford auto
oblle for the use of the Red Cross
nurse, Miss Voak, were discussed last
night at the meeing of the local Anti
Tuberculosis league which was held
at the home of Mrs. C. O. Henry on
Fairmont avenue. Every possible
means of securing one of these mu
chlnes from stealing one outright to
asking Henry Ford to give them one
was mentioned but it was finally de
cided.that the community itself would
rather provided the machine for Miss
Voalc than to obtain it otherwise.
Of the plans for securing the neces
sary funds, the popular subscription
method was decided to be best. To
this end a campaign will be begun next
week by the local league to securo
$360 with which to purchase one of
the new model Fords. Miss Voak now
has office room in Cook hospital and
her work la so varied and embraces
so largo a territory that it is almost
impossible even with the best of troi
ley connections for her to reach the
many patients who are needing her
services daily.
In addition to receiving any and all
contributions that may bo sent eith
er to treasurer of the local league, who
is Dr. H. R. Johnson, the officials aro
planning to have either a booth or a
box at the Fair next week at which
contributions from one dollar up will
be accepted. Since the entire sum
needed is only $360 and each dollar
may be the means of saving some
child's life during the next year it is
likely that many persons who wish
to share in the giving of a Ford to the
league will have to be prompt and
early with their offering.
Since there are moro than 400 au
tomobiles owned. in Fairmont ft is
planned to ask each car owner for a
contribution of one dollar toward the
Ford Fund. The systematic campaign
will be begun Monday and In the mean
time any person desiring to contribute
may do so at Dr. Johnson's office or
at either of the local newspaper of
fices.

DRY GOODS MARTS
Bank Clearings Show In
crease Throughout the
Country.
NEW YORK, Aug. 19.?Dun's Week
I ly Review ol Trade says it is still note
worthy tliat existing uncertainties
have scarcely a discernible influence
on the course of legitimate business,
which, with few exceptions, reflects
sustained activity and in some of its
more important branches shows fur
ther augmentation. The magnitude ot
general business is indicated by this
week's increase of 23.7 per cent, over
last year in bank clearings at centers
outside New York, though the gain is
partly In value, ns higher prices ob
viously require more money to pay for
the same quantities.
No department of the dry goods
markets has a monopoly or good busi
ness, but some are moro active' than
others. Distribution at retail now at
tracts special attention though
high costs and other influences may
affect consumption in tho future, sum
mer trade is exceptipnally brisk. In
primary channels the rise in prices
continues and causes conservatism in
forward operations, clothing manufac
turers, in particular, proceeding cau
tiously.
Neither wheat nor cotton have du
plicated the high levels of last week.
Yet wheat has lost few of its spectacu
lar features, and wheai prices fluctu
ate nearly 10c In a single day the fu
ture of the markets is not easy to de
terr'r.o. Crop news, though conflict
ing, was rather better on the whole,
and some traders were not disposed to
follow the long side further, lest their
paper profits diminish. The weekly
report of the Weather Bureau told of
improved crop conditions In several
sections, but of continued deteriora
tion in others, and a West Indian
storm was regarded with some appre
hension.
Commercial failures this week are
352 against last week, 274 the pre
ceding week, and 354 the correspond
ing weok last year. Failures In Can
ada number 83 against 23 last week, 21
the preceding week, ana 43 last year.

WASHINGTON, August 19?After an hour's conference with PresldenfgF
son today the 33 railroad presidents left the White House without arijrilf
tion that they had abandoned their stand for arbitration, but with*!
that the negotiations were not ended.
The railroad executives gave no final answer to the President's prop
but will deliborate on them today and see President Wilson again prbJS
Monday.
While the railroad presidents were in conference with President!^
today the President gave out a statement outlining his plan of sett"
and saying: i
"It seems to me a thoroughly practical and entirely fair program and ! tl
the public has the right to expect its acceptance." 1
In his address to the oflclals the President said: "If a strike corned the

Congress Relieves Flood
Sufferers But Turns
Him' Down.
vs: fe'tsu
A nice little row has been on betwoen
Senator Chilton and Representative
Llttlepage over- getting reliot for the
West Virginia flood sufferers which
Governor Hutfleld wired the state's
delegation in Congress would be most
relcome. In the meantime, the state
has gone right along helping the dis
tressed victims of the disaster out of
its own treasury regardless.
In brief, this is the story: Senator
Chilton got the Senate to appropriate
$100,000. A similar resolution was
Introduced in the Houfle by Mr. Little
page. He encountered objection from
the acting chairman of the committee
on appropriations, Mr. Shirley, of Ken
tucky. He suggested a dlE-rent reso
lution, and, after a conference between
Mr. Llttlepage and his Republican col
leagues who were working hard iu tne
background to forestall any objection
on the Republican Bldo which they suc
ceeded in doing, it was decided to ac
cept Shirley's suggestion. It was that
a resolution bo ottered Including West
Virginia in the $500,000 appropriated
for flood vIctlniB ln South Carolina,
Alabama and Tennessee. There had
been only $203,000 of that sum appro
priated, and Mr. Shirley gave assur
ance that there would be ample funds
from that appropriation to take charge
of the West Virginia situation. Mr.
Shirley said be would object to a res
olution of.the fo;m takc i by the Chil
ton resolution, and his objection ot
course, would be sufficient to defeat
It. Therefore, a resolution In the form
suggested by Shirley was offered by
Mr. Llttlepage and passed without ob
jection, Minority Leader Mann reluct
antly Buccumblng to the pressure
brought to bear on him by Congress
men Sutherland, Cooper and Rowers.
After that happened, tho pressure
was applied to Senator Chilton to drop
his resolution and take charge of the
Llttlepage resolution and pass it in
the upper body. This he declined to
do, and a deadlock resulted. Rather
strong Intimations have boon made
that Senator Chilton wants his resolu
tion put 'through the House, so that he
: can take entire credit for getting the
appropriation. These come from Wen
Virginians, some members of his own
party. When his resolution was be
fore the Senate, Senator Penrose re
ferred to it as "a campaign contribu
tion desired !iy tl ) West Virginia
Senator. Senator Chilton tried to ar
range with Representative Shirley to
agree not to object to hlB resolution
and to help put it through the House.
He refused.
T?day th? matter was taken out ot
Chilton b hands when the Senate
passed the flood relief Joint resolution
In tl.o form It passed the House.

tonight he had by no means given up

was determined that it shall be reach

In their formal statements the rail
road officials insisted on arbitration on
the ground that if they gate In this
time It would mean the end of the prin

feared If they granted the eight-hour
day with Its consequent added ex

would prejudice any appeal they might
