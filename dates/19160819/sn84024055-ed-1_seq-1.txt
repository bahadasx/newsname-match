Hon. Julius Johnson, the logical
candidate for state auditor, is the most
suitable of all the Republican candi
dates seeking the nomination for that
important office at the state wide pri
maries Wednesday, September 13th.
Mr. Johnson comes from the heart of
the "Military Tract," which for years
has furnished large majorities for the
Republican party, without representa
tion among the candidates for state of
fices. The nest state ticket will be
strengthened by his nomination and by
recognition given to the locality which
be represents. He received the unani
mous endorsement of the Swedish-American
Republican League of Illinois at
its convention in Princeton on March 9,
1916, and the 443 delegates to that con
vention, representing more than 80,000
Republican voters, pledged him their
hearty support. These voters con
stitute a large and deserving clement
in the party, Mr. Johnson was also un
animously endorsed by tho Republican
convention in Rock Island County on
April 17, 1916, and has a wide acquaint
ance and many supporters throughout
the state.
His Pledge.
