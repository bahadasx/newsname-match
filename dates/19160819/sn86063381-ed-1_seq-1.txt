IRISH POTATOES MAY
COST $2.50 BUSHEL
(By United Press)
St. Paul, Minn., Aug. 19.Irish po
tatoes may cost $2.50 a bushel this
year, commission men said today. The
modest spud crop is a failure this
year, they claim. This is the potato
country of the United States. Rais
ers found magnificent tops without
spuds in the ground, when they start
ed harvesting today. This is because
hot weather during the blossoming
prevented plants from "setting."
A. O. Torgerson, who has been con
nected with the county surveyor's
office for the past two years, has re
signed his position and left this af
ternoon for his home at Hawley,
Minn., where he will visit his parents.
A. L. Boudreau, who has been
playing with the Bemidji baseball
team during the past season, left last

H. A. Simons of Bemidji,
Writing Poetry.
FOEM IS PUBLISHED IN
ART INSTITUTE CATALOGUE
Given Some Attention in Badger
Metropolis for His "Cubist Poems"
Two Tears Ago.
Poetry by H. A. Simons, Jr., son
of Judge and Mrs. H. A. Simons of
Bemidji, appears as the frontispiece
to the current catalogue of summer
exhibits of the Milwaukee Art In
stitute.
Mr. Simons is now on the staff of
the Milwaukee Sentinel. He for
merly was employed by the Bemidji
Pioneer. Then he went to Duluth
to become a' reporter for the News
Tribune. From there he went to
Milwaukee wnere he became con
nected with the activities of the art
institute.
On Milwaukee Paper.
He worked for several months for
the St. Paul Pioneer Press. Later
he became assistant editor of the
Beloit (Wis.) Daily News, which po
sition he held until two months ago
when he returned to the Milwaukee
newspaper as reporter-copyreader.
At the time of the furore over
Cubist art, two years ago, he was
given some attention in the Badger
metropolis for his "cubist poems."
The poem published in the art cata
logue is in the same free verse form.
It follows:
Evening on the Canal.
Here, in the midst of the city, a pool,
Olive-greenblack beneath yonder
bridge
Somber red and brown shadows trail
ing upon it from tall business
houses,
Floating rubies dropped .upon It ^y
*sighal-lanterns,
The livid, giddy flare of an electric
sign dancing on the water-web.
And, behind all, from where the
dingy buildings yawn apart,
Dull, dying orange, changing purples
and then pure night-blue
Make a curtain,
Vague wisps of smoke and city-haze
ascending before it.
And hurrying people pass this by!
Here, you busy ones!
Whither do you rush
What greater riches do you crave,
What more delicate beauty
That you cannot lean against this
bridge with me.
Stop rushing ones
Beheld this
Soothe your madness here.

RAILWAY PRESIDENTS OPPOSED TO PRESIDENT'S PLAt ail ITATIO N SERIOUS
RAILWAY HEADS
STICK FOR PLAN
OF ARBITRATION
President Wilson Continues Confer
ence With Heads of Big
Systems.
EMPLOYES ACCEPT
PLANS OF WILSON
Strike Believed Near Washington
Administration Officials are
Still Confident.
(By United Press)
Washington, Aug. 19.The 31
railway presidents in conference with
President Wilson this morning op
posed his plan and are still sticking
for arbitration.
Employes Accept Plan.
Wilson's plan for the settlement of
the threatened strike was accepted
yesterday by representatives of the
employes. After accepting the plans
the brotherhood men took no further
action and today are waiting devel
opments. They are expecting sum
mons to the White House after the
meeting late today
Strike Seems Near.
On the surface the threatened strike
seemed nearer today than at any
time since the negotiations at the
White House began, but administra
tion officials continued to believe that
some concessions would be made and
eventually there would be an agree
ment.
Issues Statement.
President Wilson this afternoon is
sued a formal statement indicating
his intention that he~ would stand pat
in his original insistance that the
eight-hour day be granted the work
ers.
"This seems to me to be thorough
ly practical and an entirely fair pro-
gram," he said. "I think that the
j?ublic has the rigJiifJp.-jBxpect its_ac
ceptance."
It is thought that since the brother
hoods have accepted his plan, that
Wilson is preparing to throw the
blame, if the strike results, upon the
railways.
He said in his statement that ex
perience with his plan would prove
whether an increase in freight rates
was justifiable.
Against Short Day.
St. Paul, Aug. 19.Louis W. Hill,
president of the Great Northern Rail
road company, last night said that
railroad, in common with other rail
roads of the northwest would never
accept the eight-hour day principle,
as its adoption would mean receiver
ship for the big railroads of the coun
try.
