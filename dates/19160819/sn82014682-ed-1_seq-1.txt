Situation Delicate
(Associated Press Federal Wireless)
WASHINGTON, I). , Aug.
-.,19 There is no lifting Unlay of
the cloud shadowing the country'
-commerce because of the unend
ing railroad strike, but Lope ha
not been given up that the inter
vention of the president may avert
a break in relations. '
The strike" crisis continues.
practically as tense as at any time
within the past, week.- Both the
railroads and the employes are
maneuvering for the support, of
the public and of public opinion.
Each side is issuing statements
directed to the public setting forth
. ; its case.
For an hour today the president
conferred with a party of 33 rail
road presidents, discussing the sit
uation and also his attitude with
regard to it. - When the big rail
road men left thet White House,
l it was with no indication t hat
they have abandoned their stand
that the controversy shall.be sul
mitted to arbitration.' V C
'- They give assurances, however,
that-the negotiations are not end-
: ed.
After the conference, the presi
dent said: 44 If there is a strikV,
the public will know upon whom
rests the responsibility, and that
it does not rest upon me."
The railroad men and the vari
ous committees will continue their
- deliberations and will hold anoth

LEGISLATURE IS
- BAR TO OFFICERS

Hofstein's Resignation, While
on Private Advice, Regarded
as Necessary
Officers of the National Guard of
Hawaii who are members of the leg
islature must drop out of the guard,
but if, a measure now before Con
gress succeeds, the technical dis
ability will be overcome and they
may . hold both positions.
Thus does Brig.-Gen. Samuel' I.
Johnson sum up a situation which
riAveinnod last March when H. L.
HolBtein, then captain of ; the guard j
on the island of .Hawaii, sent to tne
governor his resignation as officer,
taking the position that, as a mem
ber of the lower house of the legis
lature he was disquallfledjroia hold
ing the military position.
It developed at that time also
that those probably affected were
Col. Harry A. Baldwin of Maui, Capt.
H. B. Penhailow of Maui, Capt.
Charles A. Rice of Kauai, and 1st
Lieut. Norman K. Lyman of Hawaii,
in addition to Holstein.
Unwilling to . lose the services of
- valuable officers , through this tech
nicality, Gen. Johnson and Governor
. Plnkham took the matter up and It
was stated at the time that the
question would be referred to the
attorney-general. The question arises
because of the following provision
of the. Organic Act:
. "Sec: 16. . . .'. That no member
of the legislature shall, during the
term for which he Is elected, be ap
pointed or elected to any office of
the Territory of Hawaii.
Gen. Johnson said this morning
that . so far as he knows the ques

to the attorney-general of the United

Fifth Civic Gathering and Ha
waii County Fair to Be
Notable Events
"Definite action on a proposed
highway bill, encouragement of the
National Guard, and greater cooper
ation In territory-wide promotion are
among the Important subjects whieh
the fifth Civic Convention will take
up," says Riley H Allen, editor of the
Star-Bulletin, who returned today
from a week's trip to Hilo and the
liig Island.
Editor Allen vent to Hilo to ar
range for special articles and. photo-,
graphs for a Civic Convention and
Hawaii County Fair number, which
the Star-Bulletin will issue In a few
days. He found the people not only
of the Crescent City but of all parts
of the island determined that the fifth
convention shall secure constructive
action upon matters of public Im
provement and progress.
"Both the convention and the coun
ty fair In September will be notable
attractions for people from ' other is
lands," Allen declares. "Hilo. is ar
ranging a program both of entertain
ment and of discussion w'ch is un
equaled in the four previous conven
tions. The people of the Big Island
are going Into the plans with a gener
ous hospitality which should be . and,
I am sure, will be met with a gener
ous response in the attendance from
Oahu, Maul and Kauai.
"Every man and woman I met Was
actively" Interested in the success of
the convention or The fair or both,
and most of them were hard at work
doing their share to make these
events a success. The convention
program is being put into, shape now.
The committee in charge has, and I
believe wisely, limited the, general
subjects for discussion to a compara
tively few, so that there will be plen
ty of time for discussion and the care
ful preparation of resolutions.
"It is probable that several bills
will be presented to the legislature
as a result of this convention. This
is virtually certain in the matter of
roads. The highway act first propos
ed at the Maui convention is to be
resurrected or the subject brought ui
otherwise and an effort made to put
it into shape for action by the legis
lators next spring.
County Fair to be Attraction.
'The county fair is in capable
hands and the exhibits will be well
worth going from Honolulu to see.
Although Kuhio wharf, where the fair
is to be held, has a large amount of
room, the exhibits already certain will
take up much of it. Local firms or
Individuals who wish to exhibit and
who have not arranged for their
space should write to the fair manage
ment within a few days. The fair
will have an attendance of many thou
sands and it will be good business for
local firms to exhibit there. The Star-

DEPOT IN CITY

$127,000 Structure
Provided , permission can be oh

been built at Foit'Shafter, and author
ization to construct which was re
ceived by mall last week by Capt.
David L. Stone, constructing quarter
master of the Hawaiian department,
will be erected on the waterfront, on
the army reservation, directly opposite
the navy and army slips. Waikikl of
Pier 6, and formerly occupied by the
naval station buildings, now moved to
the Waikikl end of the reservation.
Application to make the change has
been forwarded to Washington by
Brlg.-Gen. R. K. Evans, commanding
the Hawaiian department, and it is be
lieved v,ill soon be granted, although
the Oahu defense board, of which
Maj.-Gen. Alexander McComb, former
commander of the. Hawaiian depart
ment, was a member, is said to have
recommended Fort Shafter as the
depot's location.
The reason for asking the depot'3
location here is that freight from all
army transports can be unloaded on
the dock and carried across Allen
street to the depot by means of a
modernf cable conveyor system, thus
saving much time and railroad freight
charges consequent on shipping all
supplies to Shafter.

Japanese Star Defeats Ameri
can Champion in Newport
Tennis Tournament
(Associated Press by Federal Wireless)
NEWPORT, R. L, Aug. 19. Ichiya
Kumagae, thrice champion of Japan
and present champion of the Orient,
defeated' "William Johnston, American
champion tennis player, this afternoon
in the Newport invitational meet in five
sets. The scores were 6-1, 9-7, 57,
2-6, 9-7. .':." .
Kumagae's play was a revelation to
many of the enthusiasts, who had be
lieved that the champion would win
in straight sets. In the first set the
Japanese .left-handed star played re
markable tennis throughout and his
work in the back court was well nigb
perfect He showed that he has a ter
rific forehand drive, a strong back
band and was a master of tennis tac
tics. The Oriental champion took the
first set with ease.
In the second set Johnston Im
proved and the game went to deuc,
but Kumagae continued his play and
broke : through the champion's ser,Te
for a victory. Johnston rallied in the
third set and after the games had
gone to deuce and won out.
In the fourth set Johnston .showed
much of his skill that hsd brought
him the championship. His strategy
and versatile strokes were too much
for his opponent and the tennis gal
lery looked' for a victory for the
American, as he allowed Kumagae but
two games In this set The last set
Drought, the champion's downfall ajd
proved that Kumagae was all that has
been said of him. He did not con
serve his play, but was tireless, and
in the final set broke through Johns
tons serve once more and scored a
victory over the San Francisco youngster;-;
Kumagae. will enter the national
championships, which will he held 'at
Forest Hills this month. His play to
day Was such that he will be a stronie
favorite to go to the semi-finals at
least, and there are tennis enthu
siasts here who believe he has an op
portunity to win the national title.
