Copenhagen,, Aug. r8.-There
was a conference today be
tween Premier Zahle and the
leaders of the Socialistic group
in the Rigsdag which has
been opposing the sale of the
Danish West Indies to the
United States for $25,000,000.
The newspaper Dagens Ny

Dane with inside information,"
as follows:
"Denmark, upon several oc
casions, has been perilously
near war since the conflict in
Europe began. Only the high
mindedness of a certain great I
power prevented a catastrophe.
The question of the West
Indies became urgent owing to
the fear of the United States I
that some European power
might occupy the islands dur
