RAIL PRESIDENT
AT WHITE HOUSE
(Employes Take Secret Vote
Before Taking a Stand
as to Latest Plan
Widiington, D. C., Aug. 1®*
Thirty-one railroad presidents to
day told President Wilson they
stood by the decision of their man
agert' committee that an eight
hour day waa Impracticable.
President Wilson refused to
take "no" for an answer to his pro
posal that they accept the eight
hour day and asked them to re
turn to the white house tomorrow
with their managers for another,
conference.
Just
after the railroad presi-
dents left the white house It be
came known unofficially that the
•employee had voted to acoept Pres
ident Wilson's proposition and
that sqjne of the leaders had gone
to the white house to tell him so.
Washington, D. C., Aug. 18.—While
the 640 representatives of the
employes asembled in secret session
fthis mornimLifi^pte on acceptance of
president Wilson's plan for averting
a nation vide strike, the railroad pres
idents and their managers held a final
conference before going to the white
jhouBe.
There were indications that the em
ployes would vote to accept Presi
dent Wilson's proposal of a basic eignt
(hour day and settlement of side issues
{by a special commission, but the hope
'lot-settlement
was endangered by evi
dences that the railroad presidents,
'backing up their managers' committee,
!were not inclined to grant
an
eight
tour day unless it be decided by ar
titration and in any event might ask
President Wilspn for a little time in
which to think over his proposition.
President Wilson abandoned today's
cabinet meeting sd he could devote
•all his time to the crucial railroad sit
uation.
The time for President Wilson's con
ference with the railroad presidents
ibad been set for 11:30 o'clock this
morning hut the railroad men found
ift impossible to be prepared with their
Statement at that hour and the time
w&8 changed to 2 o'clock this Rftcr*
Inoon.
Men Want dvertlme.
W. L. Chambers of the federal medi
ators went to the, men's hall at the re
Quest of brotherhood officials to ex
plain some of the features of the sit
uation. He went into executive ses
sion with the heads of the four broth
erhoods on the subject of overtime.
In the men's meeting the leading ob
flection to President Wilson's plan was
that if it were accepted without extra
pay for overtime the men demanded
the railroads would contend that the
pole purpose of the men was to ob
tain more money and not to get the
eight hour day.
The president's proposal was that
the railroads establish the eight hour
•day principle and grant pay at usual
:rates
for overtime, instead of the pay
•and a half demanded by the men. All
J0
ther issues then might be referred
a commission of probably three
-members, one of whom would be
named by the president or some other
representative and the other
wo by the employers and employes
respectively.
Insist on Arbitration.
The railroad presidents want arbi
tration Hinder the Newlands act, with
two arbitrators for roads, two for the
Inen and two for the public. The dis
position of many of them was said to
be today to insist upon action of that
character and not yield to President
IWilson's plan for an eight hour day
Sinless it comes from an arbitration
board. Some of the presidents are
paid to feel that the public will sup-
ort their offer to arbitrate everything
dispute. Some others, however,
yere of the opinion that if President
Wilson chooses to exercise his power
knd refuses to press the men into ar
bitration it will be difficult for the
railroad presidents to continue oppo
litipn Jo his plan.

CONGRESSMEN
VOTE FOR LARGER
PARTISANSHIP CA8T ASIDE WHEN
STRENGTHENING OF SEA
1' DEFENSE IS UP.
BY O. GOULD LINCOLN
Sp«cial Correspondent
Washington, D. C., Aug. 18.—The
big naval building program of the
senate is about to become a law. The
hotise finally agreed to It by a vote
of 203 to 61, completely routing the
"little navy'* men. Eight members of
the lowdelegation voted in favor of
the senate building program, which
calls for the construction of 157 war
vessels of all kinds within Jthe next
three years, with four battleships and
four* battle cruisers included among
the ships to be constructed In 1917.
Two members of the Iowa delegation
voted against this program and one
did not vote. The vote of the delega
tion was aa follows:
Ayes, 8—Dowell, Green, Hull, Ken
nedy, Ramseyer, Sweet Towner,
Woods, all republicans.
Noes, 2—Haugen. republican Steele,
democrat
Not voting, 1—Good, republican.
The house also accepted by an over
whelming vote the senate personnel
Increase in the navy advocated by the
senate, authorizing an increase to 74,
700 enlisted men. This action means
the start of the United States on a
naval program which should soon
place the American navy in a place
second only to Great Britain in naval
strength. Iowa has done her share in
congress to bring this about. Both
Senator Cummins. and Senator Ken
yon voted for the big naval bill,
though they sought to have amend
ments adopted curtailing the number
of capital ships which it was pro
posed to build. In the house, as
shown by the vote Just indicated, the
republican member of the Iowa dele
"ion supported the Increase in the
navy, the first line of defense of this
country.
Now that the congress has provided
for large increases in the navy and
army, it is preparing to put the finish
ing touches on the revenue bill, which
the democrats insist is necessary to
raise the money to pay for these big
military increases. And the demo
crats are having one of the most Un
comfortable experiences they have
yet met with in preparing this meas
ure, which is now before the senate.
They Realize too late that this bill is
about to become a law just before
election and that it may cost them a
large number of votes. But they have
got to have the money or else admit
the treasury bankrupt and their party
an utter failure in administration.
The senate democrats In party cau
cus have amended the house bill very
greatly. Every effort has been made
to popularize the bill by throwing the
burden of taxation upon the wealthy
few and taking the tax off the many
poor. Hence- the large increases in
the income tax and inheritance tax on
large fortunes. Upon the passage of
this bill depends the date of adjourn
ment of congress, and democratic
leaders are doing all in their power to
get the democrats lined up solidly for
this measure. Bijt insurgent demo
crats are numerous. Wherever an in
dustry, has been hit particularly, there
is a democratic senator ready to fight
particularly if he is up for re-election
in November. The republicans realize
that the democrats are going to put
the revenue bill through no matter
what the minority party does, so they
arei contenting themselves with
speeches opposing the measure and,
keeping their own. records clear. They
know that the revenue bill will give
them another issue upon wTilch to at
tack the democrats during the can
paign.
