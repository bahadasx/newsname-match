Man can no more live without
land than he can live without
air or water, and it is as "Chris

If our lawyers and educators
were honest, things could not be

are responsible for our one-sided
laws. The bible clearly forbids
the private ownership of land
yet When Will you find a minis-
Ister who does?
Natural law forbids it. a. id the
greatest authority on ninn-made
law tells us there is nothing on

lawyer, court or "statesman" to
let this fact leak out among the
homeless masses.?
Below I print a paragraph from
Blackstonc's Commentaries on the
Laws of England, I want T0U to
read it at least twice and then
again. Our laws are copied from
England, fcays Blackstonei
There is nothing which so gen
erally strikes th imagination. and
engages tlie attention 01 man
kind, as the right to property; or
that sole und despotic dominion
which one man claims and exer
cises over the external things of
the world, in total exclusion of
the right of any other individual
in the universe. Mid yet there
are very few that will give them
selves the truble to consider the
oriffin and foundation of this
right. Pleased as we are with tin
possession. WE SEEM AFRAID T
LOOK BACK TO THE MEANS Bl
WHICH IT WAS ACQUIRED, as if
fearful of some defect in our ti
tie; or. at best, we rest satisfied
with the decision of the laws in
our favor, without examining tin
reason or authority upon which
these laws have been built. We
think it eunuch that our title is
derived by the grant of the form
er proprietor, by descent from our
ancestors, or by the last will
the dvinir owner; not caring to
reflect that THERE IS NO FOUX
DATION IN NATURE OR NAT
URAL LAW, why a set of word
upon parchment should convey
the dominion of land."
Let's repeat that last sentence
again: There is no foundation in
nature or natural law, w hy a set
of words uioii parchment should
convey the dominion of land."
. If there be anyone in the coun
ty, or anywhere else, who thinks
he can successfully defend the
present land system, the Kicker
will grant him all the space he
wants in which to make a fool of
himself.
CHRISTIANS AT WORK.
From the Melting Pot, -"it. Louis.
The following story has reach
ed this country from India, and is
vouched for as true, by the Los
Angeles Citizen, one Of the few
papers that, for reasons best
known to our Christian ammuni
tion makers w ho are bossing the
powers that be. has seen lit to
print it :
English recruiting officers en
deavoring to enlist the Hindus to
go to Eurojie und fight the bat
tles of England were met with a
flat refusal to do so fnou! four
hundred Hindus. They saw no
reason why they should travel
thousands of miles to shoot or be
shot b.v men whom they had nev
er met and with w hom they had
no quarrel.
The four hundred were given
their choice to join the army of
England, or be stood up along a
wall and be shot, and at sunrise
the next day they gave their lives
as a sacrifice to the greed, avar
ice and cruelty of the nation
which had sent them missiona
ries to teach them Christianity.
The names of these martyrs
will never be known to the big
world, but their example will live
as a power to break down the
awful institution of militarism,
Doubtless these tour hundred
Hindus were Buddhisls, whose re
ligion forbade them from shed
ding human blood. Think of this
when the contribution box is
passed asking you to donate
something to help the
missionaries save the
heathen.
Christian

In PemiSOOt county Win. Smith
shot and killed his hired hand.
Fred McAdoo. It w as given ns a
ltuson that McAdoo was inti
mate with his wife, and public
opinion and the law acquitted
Smith. Capitalist society has ft
queer code of morals. A man
may kill another, and society will
justify the killing, although the
man who does the killing, and the
meu who justify him, would do
exactly the same thing if the op
portunity presented itself. Ain't
that so? When a woman kills
another woman for improper re
lations with her husband, or,
perhaps kills the husband, then
Mr. Man takes an entirely differ
ent view of it.
To pick up an old paper of 0U
years ago and read iu it adver
tisements of black men, women
and children for sale is quite a
curiosity. In 50 years from now
It will be quite as great a curi
osity to pick up a paper of today
and read advertisements of land
for sale or rent.
If you want the truth, you must
reud the unmuwled Kicker.
CALLED HIM DOWN.
Candidate Hughes has been go
ing over the country "opening the
campaign. Instead of a can-Op
ener he uses hot air. He has been
making sjieeches in which he out
Koosevelt's Roosevelt, and has
been severely criticising the pres
ident. Nothing Mr. Wilson has
done suits Mr. Hughes.
But while he severely criticised
Mr. V llson s conduct. Mr, Hughes
nowhere dropped a hint ns to
what it would have been propel
to do, or what he would have
done under similar circumstances
had he been president.
This somewhat disgusted the
contributors to the great maga
zines. Maiazine writers are not
like the scribblers of the kept
press. They want soineining sub
stantial. They raked Hughes
speeches and could find nothing
in them but political bunk. No
where could they find When Mr.
Hughes stood on any vital ques
tion. Hence they became anxious,
and 87 of these Writers united in
addressing a letter to Mr, H,
requesting him to please say
something. Among other things
they say to Mr. Hughes:
'Personalities are without val
ue, blanket critcism IS wormies.
What We desire to know ; w hat it
is fair that the electorate should
know, are the exact details of
.vour disagreement wun resi
dent W ilson. For example)
"Would you have filed instant
protest against the Invasion of
Belgium und backed up that pro
test with the United States na .y?
"Would you have urged on con
gress an embargo upon the ship
ment of munitions to the allies'.'
Would you urge universal com
pulsory military service?
"You are frank in stating that
Heurta's morals were of 110 con

that you would have recognized

"As matters stand today, would
you be In favor of intervening in

"Does your attack upon the
Wilson shipping bill mean that
you are in favor ol ship suosidlvs?
You speak enthusiastically ol
the rights of the worker. Does
this imply that you indorse the
Clayton anti-trust law and the
seaman's bill? Or will you urge
their repeal ?
"What are your specific com
plaints against the Federal Re

"As governor of New York you

"We agree with you that it is n
"critical period.' b.v far too crit
ical, indeed, for candidates to
talk iu terms of office-seeking,
rather than iu the simple, earnest
language of definite Americanism.
AN EASV ONE,
"How are my Republican neigh
bors of the ultra-Prohibition type
going to vote?" Ironton Register
That's easy. They are going to
vote just the same as your ultra
Democratic neighbors the same
ticket as the brewers, distillers
and saloon keepers.
Can't you give us a nut to crack
that hasn't already got the shell
off. Bro. Ake.
Perhaps the best organized pol
itical machines outsiae the cities
are in Dunklin and Pemiscot
counties. Any desired result can
be obtained, in the recent pri
mary Harry Alexander of Cape
county was a candidate for tue
I oiiiination of state senator on
the Democratic ticket, against a
Dunklin county man. There an'
seven counties in that senatorial
district. According to the Capo
Tribune, Alexander carried six of
the seven counties. But he didn't
get Duukliu, and the Dunklin man
won. Six years ago Marsh Ar
nold ran against C. B. Faris, of
Caruthersv ille, for the Democrat. c
nomination for circuit judge.
There were then five counties in
this citcuit. Arnold carried al
except Pemiscot. And the Feuiis
cot man won. Either Dunklin or
Pemiscot county can produce
from oOO to 1,500 more Demo
cratic votes in a primary than
at a general election when the
occasion requires.
The rortageville Mis.-ourian
tells of 18 crap-shooters being
rounded up and fined one dollar
and costs each. The tow n got
the dollar and the officers got six
dollars iu each case. Of course
the victims were all poor devils.
After the officers hud skinne.1
their prey, probably they rolled
the bones to see who 6hould have
it all. It reminds me of the way
the officers confiscate the booze
they find on boot-leggers. One
would have to have more confi
dence in officialdom than I have
to believe they pour it on the
grouud. More probably they
pour it down their throats.
A fight similar to the one in
Scott county was on before the
county court of Cape county to
abolish the farm adviser. A pe
tition signed by over six hundred
tax-payers was presented asking
that the matter be submitted to
a vote. There, as here, it was
held that there is no law to au
thorize a vote. The people up
there have also petitioned for a
vote to abolish the highway en
gineer. The people here did vote
to abolish the highway engineer,
but they have never been able to
discover that their voting it out
did any good.
ABOUT THE WAR,
Well, we are in the third year
of the horrible European murder
fest, and they seem no nearer a
settlement than when they be
gan. First one side seems to have
the advantage and then the oth
erdepending on who sends out
the war news.
And what is it all about? You
have rend page after page of the
story, and have .vou been able to
discover anything in it except
greed ior jiowi i ami piunaer;
But there is one noticable
change since the beginning. At
the outbreak of this war all of
the rulers told us that it was
Uod's work, and that they were
only the instruments through
which Ood would work his Willi,
Not only the rulers, but also their
high priests, made the same bias
pin mous assertion.
That sort of piffle worked all
right during the black night of
i the durk ages, but too many peo
I uli' mi" thinkim- now . However.
even now, a cave man sometimes
gets up in his pulpit and yawps:
'The powers that be are ordain
ed of Ood."
Since the Eur peon war began,
some fifteen million men have
been killed, crippled or tuken as
prisoners. These people are of
the working class. These nun
have wives. mothers. sisters,
sweet-hearts. All of these suffer,
But say, Rube how many kings.
Kaisers, Czars. Sultans and other
war-lords who are responsible for
all this have been either kiiled
crippled or taken prisoner? Have
vou Heard of one? If "OU have
not. then it must be a rich man's
quarrel and a poor man'.- fight.
An dthis is w hat ,v ou wHI pro
bably vote for again this fall.
Both old parties have declared
lor preparedness, winch meant
militarism. Those in power in
any country are always very
patriotic but Hot quite enough
to shoulder a gun. Thev enact
laws mat compell Rubes to do
that
Some twenty years ago a hill
was siinucd through congress
known as the Dick military law.
Not even the congressmen w ho
voted for it knew what it meant.
Nor did they care. And the peo
ple who are supposed to rule in
this "free' country don't under
stand it .vet.
.But some of the sap-heads who
thought they would look "purtj "
in army uniform got a whiff of
its meaning. In Texas and in
several other states the guard
men refused to take the oath as
national tt'OOps. They thought
they hud only enlisted to do duty
w ithin the state a sort of police
duty to break strikes. But the
Dick law automatically makes
them subject to the call of the
president. And ignorance of law
is no excuse for a Rube.
But the present congress has
gone the whole hog. It has given
us conscription, The law don't
read that way. but that is what
it will be interpreted to mean.
The bill has been signed by the
president and is now law
nrovides for the DRAFT of

And what is the unorganized
militia? I'll bet you couldn't
guess in six months. It means
every able-bodied male citizen be
tween the ages of 18 and 4." uot
already In the service.
In England under a king, they
had fierce riots when parliament
enacted conscription after two
years of war. Her e In this coun
try where "the peepul" rule, we
slip it through and nobody knows
it.
It takes the Democrats to do
the dirty work that the Republi
cans are afraid to do. While
they were out of power the Demo
crats were anti-militarists. Do
you remember how they pictured
Roosevelt with cannons sticking
out of his mouth, eyes, nose and
ears indicating that he is a
war-lord?
This war measure passed by a
Democratic congress and signed
by a Democratic president, pro
vides for a large standing army,
it also provides for "reserve bat-
trillions from which to fill up the
gaps in the regular army. Then.
in section 79, the law goes on:
"if for any reason there shall
not be enough voluntary enlist
ments to keep the reserve buttal
lions at the prescribed strength
a sufficient number of the LN
ORti AN 1ZED MILITIA shall lie
DRAFTED into the service of the
United States to maintain each
of such battullions at the proper
strength."
.lust vote 'er straight. Rube.
If you voted for what you want
you might lose your vote. Give
the plutes more power and it
wont be long until .vou will be ns
happy as were the peons of Mex
ico before their rebellion.
President Wilson and his party
are backing the largest military
appropriation bills ever put
through congress in times of
peace and Mr. Hughes and his
party are criticising the Demo
crats because they are not larger
The proposed appropriation a
mounts to approximately seven
hundred million dollars or seven
dollars for every man, woman
and child of the nation. The
New York World puts it in terms
of wheat, and says that it means
more than two-thirds of the an
nual wheat crop of the nation.
Think of two-thirds ot the wheat
crop being wasted on militarism
while millions suffer for food.
The Kicker prints what other
papers must suppress or move.
HOW TO GET THE TRUTH.
Mr. Voter, do you want to oast
an intelligent ballot this fall?
Of course you do, and you can
not vote intelligently unless vou
know the truth.
Let me tell you how to get the
truth a sure shot !
If you are a Democrat, don't
let a Democratic paper come into
.vour house. Subscribe for a rab
id Republican paper and believe
all it suys ubout the Democrats
and .vou will huve the truth. But
dont believe anything it sayi
about the Republicans,
if you hear ot a. Republican
SpCBKtng, go h ar it and put
dow n us go'l truth all the spell
binder says about the crooked
Democrats. But don't believe a
word he sa.v about the good,
honest Republicans,
if you are a Republican, reverse
the above plan and In a little
while you may reach a point
where .vou are able to think.
Having reached that point, you
cannot avoid the conclusion that
one is as crooked as tin' other.
The old party politicians know
this. That is why .vou never hear
of them meeting in debate. Tin v
know that to meet in debate
would

Poplar Bluff Citizen.
Tins Is the sort of piffle that
leaders of old par ty pap. rs Will

Did the Democratic partj brinj

body, but Democratic editors
knows that whatever prosperity
we have is due to the European
demand for our products
But w ho i reapiu tin harvest?

It is true that the labor mark
et is not crowded as it was three
years ago. That : because of
hundreds of thousauds of foreign
laborers being cahed home bj
their government to fight.
What had tiie Democratic par
ty, or the RepubLcuu party, tod

actly the same .,v stem and no

I would be very thankful if
t he-
wise ones would explain what use
we have for a national congress
and state legislature..'
What scivii-e do they perform
except to comsume the people s
money? The courts have usurped
the power to nullify their acts
then why not abolish these ex
pensive pretenses of a government
of and by the people and admit
the truth?
What is the truth? Why. the
unvarnished truth is. that we live
uuder an irresponsible despotism,
with federal judges, not elected
by the people, in possession of the
despotic power.
What does It matter what kind
of laws your so-called represen
tative! in congress or 6tate leg
islatures may enact. 60 long as
the courts of the privileged class
may nullify them?
In the first place, your so-called
representatives are not likely to
enact any law that is or benefit
to the masses, except under ex
treme pressure of an aroused peo
llc. And even then the proposed
measure is emasculated and filled
with "jokers" so that the law of
ten works the reverse of what
the people wanted.
Take, for instance, your anti
trust laws. When the Sherman
anti-trust law was enacted, every
body thought we would hold the
big trusts now ; and nobody ever
dreamed that this law would be
twisted so as to apply effectively
to organized labor the "labor
trust", as the courts have declar
ed It. But it has been applied ef
fectively nowhere else.
Why not admit the truth? Why
not remove the sham and hypocri
sy and look at things as they are?
What use have we for law-makers
whose laws are of no effect un
less approved by the federal jud
ges appointed by the powers of
plutocrasy?
WHAT FOR?
There are now about 100,000 of
our- troops at th- Mexican bordi r.
and the war department is ar
ia rising to send 3.".')00 more as
soon as they can be had.
What for? (Secretary of War
Baker is quoted as saying that
"the sending of the troops to the
border has no more relation to
any Mexican problem than your
breakfast has to my physical
condlt Ion."
Vet he jrives no reason why all
then solders are in Texas.
Looks like the people who foot
the bill.- o.,:l!t to be given a lit
tle light for their money.
If militarism is such an honora

The rulers even deny that tin
boy scout movement is a part oi
their military program. Thej
know that if it were generally
understood that the boys were
being prepared for cannon fodder,
the mothers would object. Hence
to more completely disguise theli
purpose, the church is used as a
recruiting station for the boys.

SOCIALISM AND EQUALITY
By John Sparga
No Socialist wants to pull down
the 6trong to the level of the
weak, the wise to the level of the
less wise. Socialism does not im
ply pulling anybody down. It
does not imply a great plain of
humanity with no mountain
peaks of genius or character. It
Is not opposed to natural Inequal
ities, but to man-made equalities.
Its only protest is against these
artificial inequalities, products
of man's Ignorance and greed. It
doea not aim to pull down the
highest, but to lift up the lowest ;
It does not want to put a load of
disadvantage upon the strong
and gifted, but it wants to take
off the heavy burden? of disad
vantage which keep others from
rising. In a word, socialism Im
plies nothing more than giving
every child born Into the world
equal opportunities, so that only
the inequalities of nature remain.
SEEKING" TIIE CAUSE.
t least some of the law-making
bodies have tiled or piddling
with results and are goinj after
thecou.se. And when they do this
they find just what the Socialists
have been telling them, Two
years ago the- Illinois legislature
appointed n vice commission to
locate, if it could the cause of
prostitution among working girls,
That commission has made its re
port That poverty is the principal
cause, direct and indirect, of Im
morality, is the first and most
strongly emphsmiced findlni of
the commission.
Industrial oppression or ti,i
helpless It declared by the report
to be directly responsible for
large part of existing Immorality
Thousands of girls, it says, are
driven into immorality "because
of the sheer inability to keep
body and so.,1 together on the
low wages received by them 1
"Unregulated condition of do
mestic employment, uncertain
hours, aoaenae of definite social
status and lack of creative oppor
tunities render the home in many
cases, for the w oman servants a
breeding place for immorality."
continues the committee's flndlnjf,
Extensive investigation! con
ducted by the committee, the re
port says disclosed the fact that
more women of the underworld
fall into dishonor from domestic
employment than from anj other
work, i if ln tfirls sent to the

Yojt ideas are all second-haaj
or worse. A new idea would jar
you severely. That ls why wea's
today str ugg.ir.g along under tne
old laws and customs of centuries
ago. According to your ida. an
'tne wisd'.cn existed in tue pa.t
: and we must never do anything
unless tnere is a precedent."
1 ' There js nothing new under the
sun" you say. as you observe tne
men U. ar-ships flying above tue
clouds. And as you listen to tue
taULng machine or read of wire
less telegraphy you console y ur
eal! with. "What always has been
always will be,"
Don't thmk. It is dangerous
for those who are Tiding y ;. It
might 6hake tn.it large store of
contentment you have tee:, taught
to cheriAr. so deariy. Vou might
become a rebel against the exist
ing order of things. T:iey who ere

j As a boj l remember how system

t and free thinkers!
a free thinker Is the worst ever.
Why be is one of those awful, tin
Godly cusses w ho actually uses the
brains that God gave him to use.
He Considers himself free to think
for himself. Of course truit won't
da You must listen to the fel
lows who have you middled and
bridled sorter mu e fashion. How
ever, the mule sometimes kicks.
But you don't. That Is where the
mule has one on you.
Mental slavery Is the strongest
weipon of the ruling Olaja, So
long as they can control your
thinking aparatus they've got you
faded It beats bullets and Is so
much more polite and cheaper.
The generals and other officers
of the army could not handle four
teen million voters with the most
improved war machinery. But
your editors and educators can do
it with printer's ink and hot air
and you hardly notice it.
NOT WITHOUT AVAIL.
From Case and Comment.
"Peter Cooper, stand up."
The raw-boned "poor white
trash," holding his ragged hat in
one hand and the tail of a shab
by coat in the other walked
slowly up to the stand 1
"Yes. judge,"
' You are accused of profanity
in a public place."
"I guess I did it, Judge. Nigger
was trying to steal my hois."
"But jou should know better
than to take the name of tho
Lord in vain. Mr Cooper."
"It Wai'tt't In vain, judge. You
jes ought tor have seen that nig
ger run!"
