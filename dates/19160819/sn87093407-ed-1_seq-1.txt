coal, a big national asset, is also a jjrave
national menace.
Unless properly protected at
Resurrection Bay and Cook In
let, the fine steaming fuel of the
Matanuska and Nenana fields,
tapped by the government rail
road, will be rich bait for an in
vading enemy.
A hostile fleet from the Ori
ent would want no finer base of
operations against the Pacific
Coast than Resurrection Bay,
large and deep enough to float naif a dozen
Hfemes.
Linked with coal mines by rail, such a
harbor becomes a tremendous war factor.
Confidential agents of every foreign
government interested in the North Pacific
have been closely watching developments
on the government railroad here and
preparations to tap this new coal supply.
Japanese, Russian, English and German
agents are known to be here now, complet
ing the most detailed surveys of the entire
region.
Within ■ few month# steel will
have been laid from So ward an J

He declared he would not be the court in this
matter—that the people of the country were the
judges and that when the "naked truth in the situ
ation" is laid before them the blame for any crisis
will be placed by the people and will not fall upon
him.
Railway executives this afternoon denied posi
tively the president had at any time threatened
government ownership of railroads as a possible
result of their refusal to accept his proposal. He
declared, they said, that he was opposed to govern
ment ownership of railroads and sincerely hoped
it never would be necessary in the United States.
He said, however, they added, (hat in some
foreign countries situations such as are threatening
the railroad industry today had served as stepping
stones to government ownership and operation
when peace otherwise had been found impossible.
His statement on the strike follows:
"I have recommended the concession of an
eight-hour day—that is, the substitution of an
eight-hour day at present for the ten-hour day in all
the existing practices and agreements. I made this
recommendation because 1 believed the concession
right.
"The eight-hour day now undoubtedly has the
sanction of a judgment of society in its favor and
should be adopted as a basis for wages, even where
the actual work to be done cannot be completed
within eight hours. Concerning the adjustment
which fcbouid be made in justice to the railroads *—
the payment and privileges to which their men are
now entitled (if such adjustments are necessary),
there is a wide divergence of opinion.
"The railroads which have already adopted
the eight-hour day do not seem to be at any serious
disadvantage in respect to their cost of operation, as
compared with the railroads that have retained a
ten-hour day, and calculations as to the cost of the
change must, if made now, be made without re
gard to any possible administration economies of
readjustments.
"Only experience can make it certain rear
rangements would be fair and equitable, either on
behalf of the men or on behalf of the railroads.
That experience would be a definite guide to the
interstate commerce commission, for example, in
determining whether, as a consequence of the
change, it would be necessary and right to authorize
an increase of rates for the handling and carriage
of freight (for passenger service is not affected).
"I therefore proposed that the demand for
extra pay for overtime made by the men and the
contingent proposal of the railroad authorities be
postponed until facts shall have taken the place of
calculations and forecasts with regard to the effect
of a change to the eight-hour day; that, in the
meantime, while experience was developing the
facts, I should seek, and if need be, obtain authority
from the congress to appoint a small body of im
partial men to observe and thoroly acquaint them
selves with the results with a view to reporting to
congress at the earliest possible time the facts dis
closed by their inquires, but without recommenda
tion of any kind; and that it should then be entirely
open to either or both parties to the present con
troversy to give notice of a termination of the
present r reements with a view to inviting in
quiries into suggested readjustment of pay or
practice.
"THIS SEEMS TO ME A THOROLY PRAC
TICAL AND ENTIRELY FAIR PROGRAM. AND
I THINK THAT THE PUBLIC HAS THE RIGHT
TO EXPECT ITS ACCEPTANCE."
