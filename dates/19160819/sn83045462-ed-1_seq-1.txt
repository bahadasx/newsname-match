OREGON FOR G. 0. P.;
TMM ISSUE
Sympathy for President Wilson
Outweighed by Practical
Business Considerations.
STATE HAS NOT SHARED
"WAR BORN" PROSPERITY
100,000 Women Are to Cast Their
First Vote for Presidential
Electors.
BT N. O. MESSENGER.
PORTLAND, Ore., August 19.
?This state will go republican in
the presidential election on the
straight issues of protection and
preference for republican as
against democratic policies. This
result will follow the balloting in
November, notwithstanding the
existence of a strong sympathetic
feeling for President Wilson,
which has not been lessened by
Mr. Hughes' visit:
It will go republican simply because
there are more republicans
than democrats in Oregon, as
there have been for many years
up to 1912, when some of the republicans
went off with the bull
moose party, led by the personality
of Theodore Roosevelt.
Subsequent elections and registra
tions have shown that the bull moose
are returning in numbers to the old
party. Local republican leaders estimate
that the republican ticket will
claim 90 per cent of the progressives !
next November.
Be turning to Old Party.
There are no senatorial complications
in Oregon to mix up the campaign.
and the fight is a straightaway
contest between the two old parties.
An important new element in the balloting
will be approximately 100,000
woman voters, who for the first time
will vote for a presidential ticket,
forming practically 40 per eent of the
vote or the state.
Both parties are struggling might
and main to capture the woman vote.
The democrats have a separate woman's
organization, while the republicans
have invited the women into the '
regular Hughes alliance side by side
with the men.
Hero Worship a Factor. J
It is claimed by the democrats that
they have the "edge" on the republicans
with regard to the support of the
women, on temperamental and sentimental
grounds. They assert that thje
women are enthused to the point of
fervency over the idea that President
Wilson "has kept us out of war," and
it is claimed that the devotion to the
President's cause on this ground is
raised to a pitch of hero worship.
The republicans say that the women
are not idealizing the situation to such
extent, but are taking practical considerations
into account, such as the
market basket and the rent money, as
well as the broad proposition of the
difference in the attitude of Mr. Hughes
and President Wilson on nation-wide
suffrage.
Being mere man. deponent sidesteps
analysis of the psychology of the feminine
attitude and lets it go with the statement
of claims on each side. That there
will be a heavy registration of women is
assured since there is a recurrence of the
liquor question in the state through proposed
amendments to the Oregon liquor
law. and the women will go to the polls in
force. That issue, however, will have no
bearing on the national politics further
than to get out the woman vote.
Tariff Live Issue There.
Oregon is fruitful ground for tariff discussion.
as the state has suffered from
prostration of its lumber industry, which
is laid to the tariff. Oregon probably has
profited less than any northwestern state
out of the war and there not only is no
fictitious prosperity here, but less than
normal good times.
Mr. Hughes plowed deep and sowed
well this favorable ground for tariff disI
cussion in his speeches and received a
, response every time. His reception in
the state was flattering and his personality
won him the favor of the public as a
genial person.
Following along after hlra, only one
ground of criticism of him is encountered
and that is voiced and engendered by
the democratic press, and a certain group
of papers under one management in this
and other states supposedly non-partisan
but as a matter of fact distinctly hostile
to Mr. Hughes, and expected soon openly
to support President Wilson.
That criticism is that Mr. Hughes
"attacked the President of the United
States" and based upon the contention
that the President Is Immune to partisan
criticism because of his office.
Sympathy for President Sought.
Very adroitly Mr. Hughes' animadversions
upon the democratic party are
merged into alleged attack upon the
I President himself and ivmnofw.. -*
?* auu^Ul
to be aroused for the President thereby
ThU Is having a certain decree of
effect, in the opinion of unbiased local
ob servers, and will turn some progressive
votes to the President, but the
republicans think it will wear away as
the campaign progresses and the actual
issues are defined by other speakers.
The labor vote is being assiduously
worked py the democrats. A west coast
longshoremen's strike is on and demo*
cratlc workers are passing the word
that Mr. Hughes is inimical to labor.
The German vote of the state Is well
organized and hostile to President Wilson.
?
Local organizations of both parties
are in good working order, but th?
democrats are some weeks ahead of ths
republicans with their national work,
as the republican national committee
has apparently not got down to Oregon
on its list of states.

State Department Officials Think
Americans May Not Surrender
Treaty Rights.
While Secretary Baker and other War
Department officials refuse to confirm
or deny reports that Maj. Gen. Funston
has recommended immediate withdrawal
of Gen. Pershing's expedition
from Mexico, there were indications
today that such a message had been
received. \

Gen. Funston and also went over Gen.
Pershing's lines in Mexico.
To Report on Mobilization.
Secretary Baker conferred with Gen.
Bliss yesterday and later saw President
Wilson.
Gen. Bliss is preparing a report on
the mobilization of the National Guard,
and it is considered possible he may
have joined Gen. Funston in urging
that the troops be withdrawn from
i Mexico as the consensus of military
opinion appears to be that they are
serving no useful purpose as at present
disposed.
Withdrawal of the troops is the first
subject to be taken up by the joint
international commission.
Not to Recognize Decree.
On the theory that an American
citizen cannot renounce his treaty
rights except by renouncing his citizenship,
the Washington government
it is declared will not recognize the
decree published in Mexico City making
renunciation of treaty rights the
basis of future commercial concessions.
The chief immediate interest of the
department is the decree's possible application
to enterprises now existing
in Mexico, and assurances have been
received that these are not affected.
European governments whose citizens
may seek investments in Mexico may
take the same position in regardl to!
Gen. Carranza's effort to bring any
future concessionaries wholly under
Msgican law.

NEW YORK. August 19.?The Presbyterian

through the State Department at

to modify its order under which
American missionaries going "to India

Missionary officials say that this new
ruling will cause hardships to American

these persons to meet the requirements

LINED STAMP ALIA
IS REPORTED SUNK
Armed Steamship Plied Pe
? _ .%# i. a
Tween raew rorK ana
Italian Ports.
LONDON, August 19.?The Italian
steamship Stampalia, which plies between
New York and Italian ports, has
been sunk, says a dispatch to Lloyds.
Hay Have Had No Passengers.
The Stampalia was a passenger liner
of 9,000 tons gross. In common with
other Italian liners, she mounted guns
for protection from submarines. The
last report of her movements was her
arrival July 30 at Genoa from New
York, so that she apparently was sunk
on the return voyage to the United
States. She was commanded by C&pt.
Lavarello.
The New York agents for the Stampalia
said today that two weeks ago they
had received a cable message advising
them that all sailings of the steamship
had been canceled. They repressed the
opinion, on this account, thai the Stampalia
had been requisitioned, and was
in the service of the Italian government.
In this case she would have no
passengers on board.
The Stampalia has accommodations
for about 1,700 passengers. On her recent
voyages from Italy to New York passenger
traffic has been light, and .the
agents in New York of the line said today
she probably carried a comparatively
small number of passengers. Her
crew numbered about 170. ?
No word had been received In New
York by the agents of the line of the
reported sinking of the Stampalia. at
the time of the arrival of the London
press dispatch.
The Stampalia first appeared in New
York as an armed steamer in February
last, arriving from Genoa with two
three-inch rapid-fire guns mounted on
her after-deck house. Washington was
notified, and on being informed that the
guns were to be used for defensive purposes
only, instructed the collector of
the port of New York to grant clearance
papers.
On arriving at New York March 24,
the Stampalia reported a wireless
warning had been received soon after
leaving Genoa that a submarine was
lying in wait for her off Sardinia. Instead
of going north of Sardinia and
along the north shore of the Mediterranean,
which before that time had proved
the safest route, she went south of Sardinia
and through the Straits of Bonij
facio, between Sardinia and Corsica.
Vessels Pursued by T7-Boata.
Several armed Italian steamships
have reported sighting submarines, in
the Mediterranean, and In some instances
being pursued by them and firing
on them. Italian naval gunners
were detailed to service on armed passenger
vessels to operate the guns.
When the Italian steamship Re
D'ltalia arrived in New York August t
from Oenoa her captain reported she
had fired on three submarines lh the
Mediterranean. The steamship was
pursued for seven hours, and passengers
said they believed one of tjie submarines
had been sunk.
There has been some Increase recently
in submarine activity. The naval
expert of the Paris Temps wrote Thursday
that the German submarine campaign
against merchant ships was
again in full swing, in accordance with
a i c arm a n notn to the TTrt i t nrl Cta ???
In February, in which It was said merchant
ships carrying guns could not be
considered as peaceful vessels.
The Stampalta was 470 feet long and
55 feet of beam. She was built at
Spezia in 1909, and was owned at
Genoa.
AMSTERDAM, August 19.?In recognition
of his sinking of 100 vessels of
the entente allies, Capt. Lieut. Walter
Forstmann, commander of a Set-man
submarine, has been given the Order of
Pour le Merits by the Gentian emperor.
says a Berlin dispatch received
here. The ships sunk by him, Including
war vessels, aggregated 200.000 tons,
and their total value is estimated at
90,000,000 pounds sterling, the dispatch
adds. _ _
