POINDEXTER IS NEEDED
MORE Till EVER, NOW
The Puget Sound navy yard needs Senator Miles Poindexter.
It needs a man who conscientiously believes in government con
struction of battleships.
IT NEEDS THE MAN WHO INTRODUCED THAT FIGHT
AND WAGED IT.
Under the temis of tho bill passed, $6,000,000 is allowed for the
equipment of several navy yards. It does not compel tlie equipment
of any at once, leaving that to tlie discretion of the navy department.
Senator Mile. Poindexter is a member of the naval committee.
He is a valuable member there, more especially now that the Bremer
ton yard is one of the yards authorized to be equipped for ship con
struction.
If he is re-elected his rank in the naval committee will be ad
vanced. A new man may not even get on the committee.
As a member of that committee, he received the co-operation of
Secretary of the Navy Daniels, who personally appeared before the
congressional committee to urge the passage of Senator Poindexter'•
bill to equip the navy yard at Bremerton. Under the law as passed,
it lies within Secretary Daniels' discretion to give Bremerton first
preference.
And it will be Senator Poindexter's high standing with his col
leagues, as well as in the nation generally, that will secure to Bremer
ton that preference.
Congressman Humphrey, one of his rivals, was made the butt of
jokes in the house when he rose to speak for a Northwest project
Senator Poindexter was given careful attention throughout.
Congressman Humphrey voted for an amendment to the navy
bill which would have killed its utility so far as the Bremerton yard
was concerned.
It was the amendment that the secretary of the navy should first
inquire if any private shipyard would construct whatever battleship
was contemplated. If any private yard would undertake such con
struction, no navy yard should be equipped.
This vicious amendment was killed in the senate through the ef
forts of Senator Poindexter.
EXPERIENCE COUNTS. SENATOR POINDEXTER'S EX
PERIENCE IN THE SENATE AND ON THE NAVAL COMMIT
TEE WILL BE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO BREMERTON IN
THE FUTURE THAN IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST.

"I recommended the con

"It should In- adopted as a

Miss Eleanor Gather, All Ready for Anything.
By a Woman Reporter
I heard, the other day, that
women were adopting overalls to
do housework In.
It seems that the Idea came
from across the seas, where wom
en are doing men's work in the
fields.
It sounded a great deal like a
fishy story to me.
Later, on investigating the snb
tbiii in the department stores, I
found that several Tacoma houses
had slocks of them ordered and
that at least one, McCormack
Brothers, had them actually on
sale.
Still later I was informed that
Eleanor Cather, a "perfect 3d"
who wears the latest gowns first,
was Interested In the overalls
fad.
Miss Cather Isn't th* sort of
person one associates with over
alls at all. I wanted her to pose
in them so women readers of The
Tines could see how fetching they
were. She came to me in a charm
ing slfk frock, very fluffy and
very modern.
That is the sort of thing Bhe
usually wears—the ultra modern.
She was very gracious In her
willingness to wear the overalls.
"-She (retired to don them.
When she returned she was
clad completely In blue denim,
from tier dainty pumps to ler
brown hair, and she was obvious
ly pleased.
She whirled about so that we
might see the overalls from all
angles.
They do- look sensible —no
skirts to gather dust and Inter
fere in any sort of work, and tin >
are undeniably becoming.
Don't
You
Thank
They're
Nice
and
Nofiy?
At least they are becoming to
Miss Cather.
"I wear Just as many men's
clothes as I very well can, any
way," she admitted.
"I have a love of a black and
white silk shirt with a mannish
collar and a man's tie.
"Overalls'are quite a new Idea,
though, but I love them and hope
they will become conventional at
tire for business women, as well
as housekeepers."
