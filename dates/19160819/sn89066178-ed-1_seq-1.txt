antoea of the organic law of our
land.
Thi week we preent a stonr of
cf trial lavlts'nfst which ihows how
far the republic is drifting from the
of FUNDAMENTAL
DEMOCRACY, and how rapidl?
our 1EI)ER,L CONSTITUTION
is becoming a dead letter in some
of its most vital provisions since
the Knight of Columbus, the
Jeuits. and the American Federa
tion of Catholic Societies, or in a
word, the Horn an Catholic political
machine ha undertaken to sub
stitute the papal for the democratic
system of government.
Rome is nothing, if not intoler
ant, yet probably acting on the
theory of the thief who imagined
that " hy lustily shouting, ''stop
thief l" he could divert attention
from himself, she never tires of de
nouncing all true Americana who
loyally defend our liberal democrat
ic constitution and system of gov
ernment, as intolerant bigot. In
tolerance, fanaticism and bigotry
sooner or later, invariably express
themselves in lawlessness and crim
inal acts which menace the right
of the- citizens and the peace of so
ciety. It is easy to cry intolerance
and bigotry, but this cry is bound
to fall to "the ground unless there
are evidences in lawless acts or higl7
handed attempt to interfere with
the rights of others, and this brings
M face to face with a fact which
every thinking American, whether
Catholic or Protestant should con
aider, and because it has a vital
bonrin? upon the contention of the
Free Tress Defense League, a em
bodied in its resolutions to investi
gate the papacy, which are now be

before considering the case of offi
cial lawlessness' at Syracuse, New
York.

criminal acts were being jvvtratcd
by loyal subjects of tho h.,-c in the
Roman Catholic war on our OR
GANIC LAW, not one instance has
been recorded where Roman Cath
olics, priests, kniphts or other speak
ers have been assailed by the eiphty
five million non-Roman Catholics
for freely criticising our public
schools, our democratic system of
government, Protestantism, or other
things which are contrary to the
Roman Catholic system.
So, likewise, while Roman Cath
olic mobs have been rioting and en
gaging in monocracy in their at
tempt to abridge freedom of speech
and assembly in the interest of
Rome, no mob of Protestants or lib
eral democrats have appeared to in
timidate or assault Roman Catholic
speakers or break up their meetings.
Time and again priests and other
representatives of the Romsn Cath
olic hierarchy have uttered things
utterly repugnant to all friends of
free government and its liberal free
institutions, but the eighty-five mil
lion non-Roman Catholics have
shown no disposition to defv the
FEDERAL CONSTITUTION or
the laws of the land. Thus, for ex
ample when the late Father l'helan
delivered his notorious sermon
which he later published and scat
tered broadcast in his widely circu
lated organ, Th$ Wartern Watrh
man, containing the expression, to
gether with other treasonable utter
ance, "To Hell with the Govern
ment," though the expressions and
teachings of the priest were abhor
rent to all true Americans, he was
not assaulted or mobbed, nor wa
there any attempt to prevent htm
freely expressing his views.
The Fruit of Two System
Now what is the explanation of
this significant and expressive fact?
Simply this, the friends of the dem
ocratic system of government agree
with the author of the Declaration
of Independence that:
Reaon and free inquiry are the
only effectual agent against error.
They are the natural enemies of
error and of error only."
With Jefferson., also, they eherlsh
these basic democratic principle,
"freedom of religion, perfect equal
ity of sects before the lav; freedom
of the press; md free criticism
nd with Chancellor Kent, tho d
tingiushed jurist and author of
"Ccmmefifiirie 01 American Lau"

On the other hand the Roman
Catholics hold to the papal system
v-hieh is in direct opposition to onr
free democratic system. They hold
that the ex cafh'tiira utterances of
the pt.pe must be accepted as from
God, IIimelf. and anong such ut
terances they have from the lips of
Iro XIII, the atatcment, that:

of thought, of reih, of writing, or of

Here is the crux of the whole
question, the rrpect for the consti
tution and law shown by the eighty
five million non-Roman Catholic,
is the legitimate fruit of the liberal
democratic system of government.
The criminal lawlessness mobocracy,
rioting, murderous assault, murder,
boycott, and censorship that has
been employed by the Roman Cath
olics, is the natural fruit of the pa
pal teachings and system.
The millions of aroused patriots
who are today ready to say with
their ballot, to political Romanism
"Tlnu far $hnlt thou go, and mo
further" are not trarring against
the religion of Roman Catnolirs, tin
tess that religion leading the 7o
nianitf to trar on our FVXDA

fact must never be lost sight of.
With us it is a cae of
America First
hernu re hold that America, or
her liberal democratic constitution
and system of government embodies
vital principles of freedom and hu
man rights that are the hope of the
world.
This brings us to a consideration
of the present story of lawlessness
of official in which we have another i
distinct phase of the nation-wide at
tempt of the Roman hierarchy and
its props to destroy our most cher
ished and priceless liberties. For
years the anti-democratic papal sub

HE history of the United
States presents few cases
of political treachery sr.d be
trayal of the people so bold
and deliberate as that by which the
Burnett immigration biil is being
delayed and s'auclitered ia the
senate by friends of the administra
tion at the instance of the RomaD
Catholic hierarchy with the sanction
of the pope. If "the American peo
ple were fully aware of the course
these pliant politicians are pursu
ing there would be an outburst of
popular indignation seldom equaled
in this country.
The Burnett immigration bill
pufsed the house March 30, this
jear. More than four months have
e!nped since it came to the Senate
ami was referred to the immigration
committee. It is clearly the delib
erate purpose of the administration
and its political friends who control
the senate to prevent this measure
fiom Wing reported out of the com
mittee before the November eleo
tion. Friends of the administration
have avowed this on the floor of the
senate.
On July 59, in answering the re
quest of Senator Poindexter for
consideration of the immigration
bill. Senator Reed of Missouri re
minded Poindexter that the presi
dent had once vetoed the immigra
tion bill, and in reply to the pro
positi that it be now passed as an
amendment to the child labor bill,
made the following observation:
"Mr. Reed. In view of the fact

Democrats in their conference have
pledged themselves to make it the
unfinished business. Now, under
those circumstance no sincere
friend of the child labor bill ought
to want to jeopardise it by tying to
it the immigration or any other
bill."
Senstor Reed here epen!y avows
the purpose of the majority to pre
vent any vote on the immigration
bill at this session, but offers to
sgree that a vote may be had on the
first day of the next session of this
congress.
Senator Stone of Missourf, who is
generally understood to be a polit
ical mouthpiece of the administra
tion, on July 3, referring to Sena
tor PoindeMer's motion that the
immigration bill be taken up. de
clared that. "TUP, DEMOCRAT
IC' PUtTV is vnT r.nrvr: to
1 AGREK TO TITK MOTION OF
THE SENATOR."
In this connection the statement
made by Senator Stone on the floor
of the Senate in regard to Roman
Catholic Polish Bishop Rhode of
Chicago is extremely interesting.

11, 1IM?, contain the followirg re
mark by Senator Stone concerning
the illiteracy test in the immigra
tion bill which was then under con
sideration in the senate:
"Mr. Stone. Mr. President, I have
pleasure of a conference with him.
There is no better type of high
class, patriotic American to be
found than this Polish-American
bishop. He is a hijrh-class man
in evtry way, naturally intelligent,
n fine scholar, and intensely pa
triotic. He discussed the bill we
arc considering with me when I
mw him. lie was more familiar
with it than I was. He had secu
the original bill as introduced by
the senator from ermont (Mr.
Dillingham), and ws thoroughly
familiar with its tenns.
I told him 1
I did not believe that any American
congress or the majority of any
party in congress, would ever con
sent to that (illiteracy) test pro
vision; nor did I believe that any
president of the United State
would ever consent to it, no matter
to what party he belonged.
A few explanations will enable
the people in general to grasp the
purpose and infamy of this policy
of oU-trut'tion. If the bill should
come to a vote now it would essilv
pass. Those who oppose it virtually
admit this and no one doubts it.
That is precisely the reason why
friends of the administration are
determined that it shall not come
to a vote. Its passage in the senate
would place before the president the
alternative of interposing his veto
Sl at
1 as ne uia wnen 11 wa passea ov ine
sixty-third congres and as Mr. Taft
did before him, or permitting it to
become a law.
But for two very cogent reasons
he cannot afford thus to choose be
tween Rome and the people before
the November election. The first
reason is apparent to every one. A
veto of this bill would ccot the pres
ident millions of votes. Moreover,
the veto at this time would fail of
it purpose ; for both houses of con
gres, unless further prevented by j
the cowardly policy 01 obstruction,
would repass the bill over the veto.
The other reason for delav is not
so apparent to the casual observer.
But those who have analyzed with
care the proceedings in congres in
trying to pas this measure over
the veto last year can discern very
elearlv another deen and darJc me-
tive for the present delsy.
Several members whe voted for
the immigration bill in the last
congress atterward reversed them-
m mt u tm ov a 1 1 w aas w
selves and voted against it passage
over the veto of the president. A'
large per cent cf those who did so
were promptly rewarded with ex
ceptionally good federal appoint
mrat. As a luminous example of
this, the case of Representative
Beed of New Hampshire readily,
suggests itself. Shortly after he,
having voted for the bill, reversed
his attitude end voted against it
passage ovsr the veto, he wa ap
pointed to the responsible and lu
crative office of Philippine Com
missioner. It requires a two-third majority;
in each house to override the veto
of the president. Nothing short of
a tremendous demand on the part
of the people could obtain that ma
jority for any measure. In all such'
cases the shifting ef a very fw
votes from the number who favor
over-riding the veto to those who
oppose it will always sustain the
veto and prevent it being over-ridden.
With thee lmportnt circum
stances clssrly in view, the president
and the clever, designing politician
in the senate who are now support
ing his policv of delay hav chosen
ine ramca wnicn seem to promise
the final defeat and overthrow cf
this righteous measure. As a re
sult of the ensuing election, scores
of members of the present congres
will in all probability return to
Washington in December defeated
for re-election. Thus confronted witli
the prospect of involuntary retire
ment to private life, these members
will be more than ordinarily sus
ceptible to the allurement of execu
tive appointments.
The offer of a federal judgeship
will he a great inducement to the
average politician in this predica
ment to cast his vote as the admin
istration desires. By this avenue it
is believed that enough discouraged
and hungry politicians
can be

Unable to meet or deny the facts
recently made public regarding ihe
shameless prostitution of the hos
pital in the United States Soldier
Home at Washington, D. C, Rome,
has resorted to her usual dishonest
method in trying to evade the issue
and deceive the public.
It is to be regretted thst the Vs
tional Tribune published at Wssh
ington, D. C, and circulated widely
among veterans of our wars should
lend its columns to this deliberate
Roman Catholic evasion.
Under date of July 8, 1916, Ar
thur Quigley of the great Roman
Catholic city of Milwaukee wrote a
letter to General Young, governor
of the Home, in regard to papal ac
tivities in that institution. Mr.
Quigley does not state in his letter
whether he is a brother to the late
Roman Catholic Archbishop of Chi
cago of the same name. Col. W. T.
Wood, secretary-treasurer cf the

gives no information at all touching
any of the fact recently published
in the patriotic press. The Tnbnne
publishes Quigley' letter and Col.
Wood's reply and then state that
the officers of the Home are not
Roman Catholics and that the
charges msde in the Protestant
newspapers are absolutely baseless.
This conclusion is a curiosity in
journalism and in common ense.
The officer of the Home had not
been charged with membership in
the Roman Catholic church. But
