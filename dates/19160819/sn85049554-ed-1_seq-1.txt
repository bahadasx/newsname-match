Washington. /Aug. 19.—After an
hour's conference with (President Wil
son today the thirty-three presidents
I left the White House without giving
any indications that they had given up
'. their stand for arbitration.
•The road executives gave no final
answer to the president's proposals but
wii deliberate on them today and se«
the president again Monday.
In his address to the officials, Pres
ident Wilson aaid:
'It
a strike comes the public will
know where the responsibility rests. It
wiil not be on me."
Wilson Issues Statement.
MS While President Wilson was confer
ring with, the executives he made pub
lic a statement outlining his plan. He
said:
"It seems to rae a thoroughly prac
tical and entirely fair program and I
think the public has a'right "to expect
its acceptance.
*1 recommend the acceptance of the
eight-hour day—that la, the substitu
tion of the eight-hour day for the pres
ent ten hour day. I make this recom
mendation because believe the eight
hour day right It should toe adopted
as a wage day even where the actual
'work can net be done In-eight hours.
"Concerning the adjustments which
should be made In justice to the rail-
Toads' and their stockholders in pay
"rn&nts and privileges to which their
men/ are entitled—there la a wide ,41
yeirgency of opinions.
"The railroads which have adopted
*"th$ eight-hour day do not seem to be
at any disadvantage in their cost of op
eration compared to those roads which
.?~5*orty •tperlence can make it certain
#hat rearrangements woald-befair ahtf
equitable either on tbehalf of the men
of on behalf of the railroads. That ex
perience would be a guide to the In
terstate commerce commission, for ex
ample, In determining whether as a
consequence of the change It would be
necessary and right to authorize an In
crease of rates for the handling and car
riage of freight (for passenger service
,,
tj
is not affected.)
Would Delay Overtime Question.
'"I, therefore, propose that the de
mand for extra pay for overtime and
the contingent proposals of the railroad
authorities be postponed until facts
shall have taken the place of calcula
tions and forecasts with regard to the
effects of the change to the eight-hour
day that In the meantime I should
Seek and if need be, obtain authority
from congregp to appoint a body of Im
partial men to observe and acquaint
themselves with the results with a
view to reporting to congress at the
earliest possible time the facts dis
closed by their Inquiries but without
recommendations of any kind, that It
"i should then be entirely open to either
I or both parties to the controversy to
give notice of termination of the pres*
ent agreement with a view to Institut
ing inquiry into the readjustment of
pay or practice.
"This seems a practical and fair pro
gram and I think/the public has the
right to expect Its acceptance."
Spokesman For 100,000,000
President Wilson declared he was the
spokesman for 100,004,people. His
only object, he said, was to avoid a
strike, with its consequent disaster to
the nation.
^. The president paced-up and down as
he spoke. Several times he emphasized
points with a clenched fist. He often
paused and faced the officials as he
•sked that they accept his plan.
Mr. Holden told the'president they
realized the seriousness of the situa
tion.
"We must face the naked truth in
this crisis," s&ld the president. "We
must not dlsctjps impracticable things,
we must get down to a basis on which
the situation can be solved."
Negotiations to Continue.
All the railroad presidents said the
question was not closed and that the
negotiations would be continued.
President Holden, of the Burlington,
spokesman for the officials, said no
time had been jet for them to see the
president again, but said that it was
necessary to confer again with the
committee of managers.
Several of. the executives indicated
disappointment over President Wilson's
statement but showed partlftular Inter
est in his mention oft the possibility of
the interstate commerce commission
considering an increase In freight rates.
In his conference today the president
told the officials they were facing a
condition, not a principle. He asked
Why t,hey demanded arbitration when
there was no law of compulsory arbi
tration. TJie employes, he recalled/had
consistently refused arbitration and.he
Relieved It was impossible to gain it in
•v .th* present controversy.
"I have been asked to sit as a Judge,"
laid the president. "I can not do that,
simply can suggest 'a plan, a way in
Which I believe this question can be
y^jettled fairly to all sides."
-VKresident Wilson urged again that
therallroads accept the plan, adopt the
elfht-bouT day, at least temporarily,
"-s
-O .:yv'\.
and then adow the commission to in
vestigate the facts.
Thinks Plan Equitable.
In conclusion President Wilson said
he believed his plan was the only equit
able way of settling the controversy and
.that under it both sides would be
treated fairly. Mr. Holden gave the
president estimates of the eight-hour
day cost to railroads. In reply President
Wilson asked that the railroad officials
with the committee of managers very
carefully consider his plans before giv
ing any final answer.
It was learned definitely that in their
acceptance of the president's plan the
employes made no reservation.
One of the railroad presidents said
after the conference that. be did not
consider the situation hopeless but thai
It was very serious. President Wilson,
he said, had asked for a "show down*
and that the railroad officials would
give a final answer as soon as possible.
The belief was current In administra
tion circles that the railroads would
make some concessions.
After the conference the president
telegraphed to presidents of western
roads inviting them to come to Wash
ington.
Both Sides Fear Public Opinion.
The railroad employes representa
tives, having voted to accept the presi
dent's plan, had another meeting today
to talk things over. Out of maneu
vering on both sides for a position
which will enjoy the support of public
opinion come many evidences that
each Is working to organize public sen
timent in Its favor.
It was understood today that the
railroads are turning to other large
employer's" of labor to express their
support of the preservation of the peo
ple's principle of arbitration as a re
sult of industrial disputes, while Pres
ident Wilson and the employes are
drawing, support from large manufac
turing and other Interests vitally in
terested in keeping the railroads open
for business and from those who want
to see the movement for the eight
hour day carried forward.
Will Ask Rats Increase.
The carriers wouMLlilte-'to--obtain a
modification "providing for a nine in
stead of^ an eight hour basic day. In
any event they would like to obtain
assurances that transportation rates
will be advanced sufficiently to offset
the Increase in Wages. If compelled
to yield they will endeavor to fix the
responsibility upon the president in a
way designed to procure his Influence
in favor of a rate raise.
The railroad presidents admitted that
if the eight hour day be established the
consumers will be asked to pay the
$60,000,000 Increased operating ex
penses.
Sfcibmit to Huge Milking.
"We will make no further effort to
argue on a basis of dollars and cents,"
said one of the executives. "Contrary
to our previous Impressions, we find
that It is a matter of no concern what
ever whether or not, by the decree of
a man who refuses flatly to listen to
our side of the case the common car
riers are to be milked for $50,000,000 a
year,
,"We disagree with our employes. We
believe we are right and they presum
ably believe they are right. We are per
fectly-Willing to leave It to intelligent
4ifeto^l^v^^^gjr(S^between
en
us.
"The men will not accept arbitration.
'""'"We point to the lntentate com
merce commission. The men will not
accept.
"We suggest that Mr. Wilson himself
name the arbiters. Again the men will
not accept "«J4
"And then we come to Washington.
We expect that intelligent public opin
ion, kixrwing that the argument in
court is a better way of settling dis
putes than the old time cave man fight,
will Insist that there be calm consider*
atlon.
"And here we find that the 'chief
magistrate of the land repudiates his
own legally created board of mediation,
repudiates the whole doctrine of arbi
tration, repudiates the baplc idea of Ju
dicial settlement of disputes, and with
a prodigal hand gives to 400,000 voters
in the coming election actually more
than they expected and vastly more
than they could have obtained.by the
route provided by law."
