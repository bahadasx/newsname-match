A Card to Owners
of Rural Telephone Lines
We are anxious to see that all lines owned by
other parties and connected with us are kept in such
condition as to furnish efficient service. Where the
owners of rural lines are responsible for their upkeep,
we wa nt to co-operate with them
AH lines require a thorough overeauiing occa
lionally if the best service is to be obtained. We
itcommend that every line connected with ua be
overhauled at least once a year, and that at least one
experienced telephone man assist in this work. The
cost of this work when divided among ail the patrons
of the line, makes the amount paid by each man
nn«H, and this cost will be more than offset by the
improved service.
If the owners of rural telephone lines in this sec
tion are experiencing trouble with their service, we
will appreciate their talking the matter over with our
Manager or writing us fully. We wiil gladly do
what we can toward helping you improve the con
dition of your line.
