IS B F INNING TO WANE
Less Cases and Less Deaths This
Week Than Last.

time since the epidemic of infantile
paralysis in this city reached pro
portions to alarm the health authori
ties the advisory committee of the

and cases in previous weeks.
For the six days ending today it
was. shown there had been ITS cases, i
an average of about 130 a day, while I
the week previous the average . i
more than 16 4 a day. In tho week
ending August 5 the cases averaged
15S a day.

ed out. .eraged less than 32 a day,

tee when it was decided also to begin
an exhaustive investigation to deter
mine whether the removal of tonsils
and adnois in children is responsible
for the disease. It is planned to learn
also if enlarged tonsils and adnoids

in regard to the operation of the cen

"'Considerable misapprehension evi

which on our wires nd cables is nee
sary as long as Germany continues in
absolute control of all information
from the country. If Germany should
abondon the censorship we would not
interfere with despatches from un

"Another reason we now censor such
matter is the fact that Germany cir
culates in other countries despatches
sent to American newspapers as the
comment of those papers.''

What Advertising i
Frequent reference is made to the number of automobiles through
out the country and the rapid manner in which the number of owners
increases. The growth has been marvelous but there has been no
greater -factor in obtaining this than newspaper advertising. It has
been the one great force that has made the automobile business what
it is today.
Printer's ink has spread the story of the motor car to the utmost
corner. From an unknown factor of a few years back, advertising has
proved to the farmer that he can't afford to be without one. It has
shown the business man that he needs it for better service and for
pleasure, while the doctor's buggy is now almost a curiosity.
What advertising has doe in this respect is only a repetition of
the old story. It will do even as much for your line of business if you
w-ill but command it and in its field The Bulletin assures the most
far-reaching effects. No business house can afford to be without it.

Railroad Officials
to Reply Today
EMPLOYES HAVE ACCEPTED
PRESIDENT WILSON'S PLAN
DEADLOCK STILL EXISTS
Indications Are That the Railroad
Officials Will Press Further Their
Offer to Arbitrate All the Points at
Issue.
Washington, Aug. 13. Presidon
Wilson's plan for settlement of the
threatened nation-wire railroad strike
was accepted today by the representa
tives of the employes and taken under
consideration by the ofticials of the
railroads with many indications that
they would reject it tomorrow. The
word came from the managers tonight,
however, that they had reached no
definite decision.
With the situation thus apparently
at a deadlock the only hope in the sit.
uation lays in that the representative
of the railroads might suggest a count
er proposal forming the basis of a
settlement or that one side or the
other might recede from its present
position.
President Submits Plan to Officials.
Thirty-one presidents and ranking
officials of the great railroads receiv
ed from the president this afternoon
lus plan for the adoption of an eight
hour day, rejrular pro rata pay for
over time and creation of a federal
commission to investigate collateral
as AccomDiisne
issues. They told him they would
like to consider the question and
would report back tomorrow with the
committee of managers which has
been conducting negotiations.
Employes Approve Plan.
At the same time the general com
mittee of 610 representatives of the
employes were approving the presi
dent's plan by a large majority, and
soon after the railroad officials left
the White House the four heads of
the railroad brotherhoods delivered to
the president a letter notifying him of
the ease. The employes' committee
will remain here at the president's
call.
No Statement From Officials.
While the railroad facials would
make no formal statement they re
vealed clearly their opposition to Mr.
Wilson's plan and indicated that they
would press further their offer to ar
bitrate all the points at issue.
In spite of these developments it
was reported, the officials might sug
gest a counter proposal based on the
acceptance of the eight hour day and
arbitration of all other points, instead
of the investigation by a federal com
mission proposed under the president's
plan.
