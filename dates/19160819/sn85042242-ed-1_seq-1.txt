positions north of the Somme, in
France, have resulted in the gaining
of additional ground by the attackers,

BUYS FACTO SITE
Chicago Company, Pioneer in
Electric Range Manufacturing,
Plans Big Building
A big real estate deal in Chicago
that is of interest to Bismarck peo­
ple is the purchase of a factory site
by the Hughes Electric Heating com­
pany, the head of which is a brother
of Senator E. A. Hughes. The Chica­
go Tribune says of it in part as fol­
lows:
"The deal in manufacturing proper­
ty was the purchase by the Hughes
Electric Heating company, manufac­
turers of electric ranges, ovens, and
miscellaneous heating devices, who
have been located at 215 West Schil
ler street for the last four years,
through J. J. Harrington ft Co. of a
tract of 111,000 square feet of ground
located between the Baltimore and
Ohio Terminal railway, West Taylor
street, Fifty-sixth and Waller avenue.
The consideration is not disclosed,
but it is said to hare been about $33,
400, which is at the rate of about 30
cents a square foot
Modern Factory Plant Planned..
"lit is announced that ground will
soon be broken for the erection of the
first unit of a modern factory plant,
designed by Architect C. A. Erkstrom,
the cost of which, with the equipment,
is placed at aobnt $150,000. It will be
one story high, will contain approxi­
mately 80,000 square feet of floor
space, and will give employment to
people. It will contain, in addition
to other conveniences, a restaurant
for employes, a private dining room
for the officers, while all the cooking
will be done exclusively on electric
equipment.
"The Hughes company is said to be
the pioneer electric range manufac­
turer, making its first electric stove
in a small factory on Superior street
in August, 1910. The building is ex­
pected to be completed and ready for
occupancy Dec. 1 next. This district
is developing considerable activity in
Industrial property."

Regiment After Seeing
It Drill
(By Ewing Lewie.)
Mercedes, Tex., Aug. 18.—Ammuni­
tion has been issued to the men of the
North Dakota regiment, and sentries
now carry powder and lead at night.
Four hundred rounds of ammunition
have arrived for the regiment. A
rifle range between Mercedes and
Llano Grande has been selected and
is being prepared for practice. Mark
manship work will start soon. The
Bismarck men are eager for the
chance to show what they can do
with Uncle Sam's rifles, having in
their number a dozen men who have
proved themselves crack shots in gov­
ernment tests.
Lieut. Charles King, army instruct­
or to the North Dakota regiment, has
been withdrawn to West Point and
the regiment for the present has no
instructor. A captain of regulars
strolled over to the camp yesterday
and saw the Bismarck men drill.
When their work was completed he
said: "I don't see any special need
of having a federal instructor for
these men. I've seen regulars who
ought to be proud to make a showing
like that."
Want New Ambulance.
The regiment is eager to see the
new auto ambulance which will be
provided for by subscriptions being
taken in the home state. It will be
the only auto ambulance at Mercedes.
Llano Grande, where the brigades of
three states are stationed has none.
It will be a feather in North Dakota's
cap, and 'proof of her enterprise and
patriotism when the auto dashes
through the streets here.
Every mesquite tree and all under­
brush has been cleared from the regi­
mental field. The officers decided
that as long as there was any of the
old vegetation here, the scorpions and
rattlers would stay. So the homes
of the old settlers were razed and
thrown out on the chapparal, and
there has not been a scorpion sting

CORPUS CHRISTE WILL
RECEIVE BRUNT OF STORM
San Antonio, Aug. 18.—Corpus
Christi, a city of about 20,000 popula­
tion, a popular resort on the Texas
coast, it appeared Friday night, would
receive the brunt of the tropical
storm and hurricane approaching the
United States from the West Indies.
The storm has cost the lives of nine
men of the steamer Pilot B'oy, it is
feared. The boat was a small freight­
er and went down about noon Friday
in the Gulf of Mexico, and only three
of the crew of twelve have been ac­
counted for.
The crest of the storm was expect­
ed to strike Corpus Christi about mid­
night, when a severe gale was ex­
pected, according to the weather
bureau theere.
Brownsville reported Friday night
over the army wireless at Fort Brown
that only broken windows, leveled
fences, and trees, and the razing of
tents in the military camps near
Brownsville has resulted. United
States soldiers and national guards­
men froiq Illinois, Iowa, and Virginia
were forced into the city to take
refuge in the city hall, courthouse,
and warehouses, where they took two
days' rations. Communication by
telegraph and telephone was lost
from Brownsville early in the day.
Storm Is Abating.
General Funston, at 9 o'clock to­
night, received a wireless message
from ureneral James Parker, at
Brownsville, in which he stated that
the storm seemed to be abating there
and that he thought perhaps the
worst was over. The wind was then
reported at 50 miles.

Candidate for President Reiter

Protective Tariff
San Francisco, August 18.—Charles
E. Hughes reached the farthest point
west here today. Before three audi­
ences in this city he spoke of domin
ent Americanism, preparedness, and
his belief in the needs for a protec­
tive tariff.
Mr. iHughes reached San Frar.oisco
at one o'clock, went to his hotel
through crowds, which applauded him
along the way, and made the first
of his addresses before the Union
League club at three o'clock. He hur­
ried back to his hotel, and there ad­
dressed a meeting of women voters.
Tonight he addressed a meeting in
the Civic auditorium, which was pre­
sided over iby William H. Crocker,
republican national committeeman
from California.
Between addresses, Mr. Hughes
conferred with republican and pro­
gressive party leaders here in the in­
terest of party harmony. The nomi­
nee confined his suggestions to a plea
for co-operation among republicans
and' 'progressives. In? so doingl 'Mr.
Hughes said that he fid not. $rppose
to interfere in the State's lodal af­
fairs, but that he wanted all Ith^ ele­
ments of both parties to work togeth­
er in the interest of the national tick­
et.
Among the leaders who conferred
with the nominee today, were Ches­
ter H. Rowell, of the republican na­
tional campaign committee, who join­
ed the Hughes party yesterday on
its way from Portland to this ctiy,
Francis V. Kefling, chairman of the
republican State central committee,
and William H. Crocker, republican
national committeeman.
In his address, Mr. Hughes spoke
chiefly of the protective tariff, reiter­
ating his contention that it was nec­
essary for upbuilding American in­
dustries and that its enactment and
enforcement should 'be entrusted to
the republican party.
in addressing the women voters,
Mr. Hughes repeated his conviction
that the suffrage issues should 'be
speedily decided, and the vote grant­
ed to women throughout the country
by amendment to the federal consti­
tution. He reiterated his reason for
wishing this done, assailed the ad­
ministration for waste and extrava­
gance and declared that under proper
leadership, it would .be possible for
America to achieve all its ideals.

Washington, August 18.—The ad­
ministration's shipping bill creating a
shipping board and appropriating $50,

chase, or operation of ships was pass­
ed by the senate late today by a
strict party vote of 38 to '21. It al­

JOHN REUTER OUT
OF NEXT TOURNEY
Dickinson, Aug. 18.—John Reuter,
Jr., state golf champion, will not com­
pete in the state tournament next
year, such announcement being made
today. The next tournament will be
held in Dickinson, and Mr. Reuter
feels it would be a distinct advantage
in his favor if he went into the play.
Reuter has won the championship
twice, and has clearly demonstrated
his superiority as a golfer.
Washington, Aug. 18.—The army
appropriation bill was unexpectedly
vetoed today by President Wilson be­
cause he would cot accept certain
provisions in the revision of the arti­
cles of war, forced into the bill by the
house conferees and commonly said
in army circles to be in the interest
of certain retired officers "at outs

PLENTY HARVEST
HANDS, SAYS STANLEY
No Difficulty Will Be Exper­
ienced in Properly Harvest­
ing and Threshing Crop
Unprecedented Ibuilding operations
are responsible for a shortage of skill­
ed laborers, declares T. L. Stanley,
federal labor agent, co-operating with
the State commissioner of agriculture
and labor.
"•In reviewing the present labor sit­
uation in North Dakota, 'this depart­
ment finds from reports covering the
entire State that the present supply
of labor for the harvest fields is gen­
erally well-distributed," declares Mr.
Stanley. "There is a demand, how­
ever, for a few men in some of the
outlying districts, which is being sup­
plied from applications on hand. This
would indicate that there will be no
shortage of farm labor to properly
harvest and thresh the crop and get
ready for next season.
Shortage of Skilled Labor.
"There is apparent, however, a
shortage of skilled labor for the in­
creased building operations taking
place all over the entire State. Per­
haps never before have the railroads
'been so taxed to bring the State buil­
ding materials as during the present
year.

the Northern Pacific railroad, is quot­
ed as saying that their line has never
been called upon to handle as much

STRIKE SITUATION COMES
TO CRITICAL STACE HOPE
EOII SETTLEMENT WANES
Both Managers and Employees Are *t a Deadlock on the Quegtiba'
of Walkout of Railroad Men That Would Place Bnginn
at a Standstill in the Entire United States
RAIL HEADS STILL WISH
TO ARBITRATE ALL POINTS
Washington, August 18.—President Wilson's plans for settle*
ment of the threatened nation-wide strike was accepted today by
the representatives of the employees and taken under consider
ation by the officials of the roads with many indications that they
would reject it tomorrow.
The word came from the managers tonight, however, that they
had reached no definite decision.
With the situation thus apparently at a dead-lock the only
hope in the situation lay in the report that the railroad officials
might suggest a counter proposal forming the basis of a settle*
ment, or that one side or the other might recede from their pres­
ent position.
Thirty-one residents and ranking officials of the great railroads
received from the President this afternoon his plans for the
adoption of an eight hour day, regular pro-rata pay for overtime,
and creation of a Federal Commission to investigate collateral is*
sues. They told him they would like to consider the question, and
would report back tomorrow with the committee of managera
which has been conducting negotiations.
Not Workers Enough To Care
for Unprecedented Building
Operations
At the same time the general cpm
mittee of 640 representatives of .the
employes were approving the Presi­
dent's plans 'by a large majority, and
soon after the railroad officials left
the White House four heads .of toe
railroad brotherhoods delivered to 'the
President a letter notifying him of
the vote. The employes' committee
will remain here, .at the President)*
V"1
May Suggest Counter Proposal^
In spite of these developments, it
was reported, the officials might sug­
gest a counter pi oposial, based on the
acceptance of the eight-hour day and
arbitration of all other points, instead
of the investigation by a federal com­
mission proposed under the Presi­
dent's plan. It was stated positively,
however, that the officials had reach­
ed no definite decision on their fu­
ture course.
In case the President finds ,no
hope of settlement during his confer­
ence with the railroad officials to­
morrow, he probably will summon to
Washington some of the powerful fi­
nanciers of the country serving as
directors of the railroads. Adminis­
tration officials said tonight he had
by no means given up hope of ef­
fecting a settlement and was deter­
mined that it shall 'be reached, if pos­
sible, before the representatives of
both sides now here leave Washing­
ton. In their informal statement, the
railroad officials insisted on arbitra­
tion on the ground that if they gave
in this time, it would mean the aban­
donment of the principles of arbitra­
tion, and because they feared if thejr
granted the eight-hour day with its
consequent added expenses without
resort to arbitration it would preju­
dice any appeal they might make
later to the Interstate Commerce
commission for higher freight rates.
Strike Appears Nearer.
On the surface the threatened
strike appeared nearer today than at
any time since the negotiations at
the White House began, but adminis­
tration officials continued to 'believe
some concessions would be made and
that .eventually there would ibe an
agreement.
Having accepted the President's
plan of settlement, the committee of
employes took no further action, tod
awaited developments. They were ex­
pecting summons to the White House
again fter the meeting tomorrow be­
tween (Mr. Wilson and the railroad of­
ficials.
Official* Confer With Wilson.
The group of railroad presidents
and officials, who came here in an­
swer to an invitation from^tfte Presi­
dent, conferred with him less than an
hour.
After Mr. Wilson had explained his
plan, Hale Holden, president of the
Chicago, Burlington A Quincy, acting
as spokesman, informed the President
that the officials present couM speak
only for their individual roads and
the conference committee of mana­
gers was the only body'with power
to accept or reject proposals.
*Syi
It was indicated plainly to )(r. Wil­
son that the officials were inclined to
stand behind the previous attitude at
the managers' committee in refnatag
to accept the elgfat-hodf day and thit
the proposal was believed to be tar
practicable. The President was teld.
towever, that the plan wonld to

While the railroad officials would
make no formal statement, they re-
vealed clearly their opposition to Iff.
Wilson's plan, and indicted that they
would press further their offer to ar*
bitrate all the points at issue.
