"Conditions More Important
Than Principle" Wilson.
(BILLKTIX.)
Washington. Aug. 1 9. President
Wilson this afternoon summoned ad
ditional western railroad pre-identa to
Washington.
The president's telegram follows:
"Discussion of the matters involved
in the threatened railway strike is
still continuing. It is highly important
that I should personally confer with
you or fome one authorized to repre
sent you at the earliest poss-blt mo
ment. Hope you can arrans-? matters
so as to he able to come to Washing
ton at once."
Demanding arbitration as a basis of
settling the dispute with the brother
hoods. Hale Holden, president of the
I'urlington lines, this afternoon issued
a statement outlining the position of
thirty-three railroad executives who
called on President Wilson this morn
ing. It is essentially the common right
of every citizen to "have his day in
court; it is indeed a substitute for
wasteful litigation recognized long
since in the codes of all civilized
countries." the statement said in em
phasizing the necessity for arbitra
tion. The eight hour day when con
sidered irt " connection' witfl" rai?roat
train service is a question of honest
difference, the statement says. The
fact that railroads must operate at all
hours renders it impossible tot re
strict the hours of railroad labor to a
fixed standard," it said.
Washington, Aug. 19. President
Wilson today, in a formal statement
of his proposal for settlement of the
difficulty between the railroads of the
country and the railroad brother
hoods, indicated his intention to stind
pat on his insistence that trie e;;ht
hour day b- granted the workers.
President Wilson's statement was
read tu a meeting of the 640 members
of the brotherhoods' general commit
tee, after which adjournment was tak
en until 10 a. m. Monday.
"This seems to me a thoroly practi
cal and entirely fair program." he said,
"and I think the public has ;t right to
expect its acceptance."
"The eight hour day undoubtedly
has the sanction of the judgment of
society in its favor and should be
adopted as a basis for wages, even
where the actual work to be done can
not be- completed in eight hours," the
president said.
At the same time the president pro
posed that the demand for extra pay
for overtime and al! other issues be
postponed, pending an investigation,
and susgested that if necessary he
would oiitain authority from congress
to appoint a body of Impartial inves
tigators to probe the whole situation.
This body, he said, would report to
congress, tho without making any rec
ommendations. In his address to the officials. Pres
ident Wilson said: "If a strike comes
the public will know where the re
sponsibility rests. It will not be upon
me.'

London. Aug. 19. The Italian
steamship Stampalia, which plies be
tween New York and Italian port ,
has been sunk, says a dispatch to
Lloyds.
The Stampalia was a passenger liner
of 9,000 tons gross. In common with
other Italian liners she mounted guns
for protection from submarines. The
last report of her movements was her
arrival on July 30 at Genoa fiom New
York, so that she apparently was sunk
or. the return voyage to the United
States. She was commanded by Cap
tain Lavarello.
The Stampalia has accommodations
for about 1.700 passengers. On her
recent voyages from Italy to New York
passenger traffic has been light and
the agents in New York of the line
said today she probably carried a com
paratively small number of passengers.
Her crew numbered about 1 70.
No News Reaches N. Y. Agents.
No word has been received in New
ork by the agents of the line con
cerning the reported sinking of the
Stampalia at the time of the arrival
of the London press dispa'ch. The
Stampalia first appeared in New York
as an armed steamer In February last,
arriving from Genoa with two three
inch rapid fire guns mounted on her
after deck house. Washimrton was
notified and on being Informed that
the guns were to be used for defensive
purposes only, instructed the collector
of the port of New York to grant
clearance papers.
On arriving at New York on March
24, the Stampalia reported a wireless
warning had been received soon after
leaving Genoa that a submarine was

Portland, Ore., Aug. 19. The three
northwestern states. Oregon, Wash

bushels of wheat to move to the At
lantic seaboard within the next six
months and practically no cars are in
sight in which to move it, according
to a comprehensive survey completed
today by the local railroad men.
The railroads will be called upon to
provide about 38.500 cars, the average
capacity of a car being 1,300 bushels.
Virtually all the prrain of the north
west this year except that needed for
domestic consumption, will move east
ward by rail.
The barley movement soon to start
will require 1.500 cars in addition t
the number required for wheat. About
20,000,000 bushels of wheat are sold
for delivery within the next two
months.

Kansas City, Aug. 1 9. Confirma
tion of the re-organization plans for
the Kansas Natural Oas company, as
tentatively announced recently at
Pittsburg, Pa., was given here today
by W. R. Thurmond, attorney for R.
A. Long, one of the directors of the
company. Mr. Thurmond's announce
ment follows yesterday's conference
here of the receiver and attorney of
the company. The gas company will
issue 59,000,000 worth of stock, to be
sold at 50 cents on the dollar, accord
ing to Mr. Thurmond's announcement.
Of the $4,500,000 obtained, $3,000,000
will be used to pay the indebtedness
of the company, while the remainder
will be used for extensions. Old stock
holders are expected to take the new
issue. The conference yesterday,
those most closely interested pointed
out, developed the feeling that the
company would not be justified in
spending such an amount for improve
ments unless it could get a higher
price for gas.
Some wonder was expressed, it was
said, as to what stand the Kansas pub-
lie utilities commission would take in
regard to the proposed
re-organ iza-
tion plan.

San Francisco. Aug. 19. California
Republicans will have to settle their

Presidential Candidate Charles E.
Hughes does not propose to recognize
the existence of any friction.
The Republican nominee so indicat
ed his position today in conferences
with various state leaders. In the
meantime, a truce was1 apparent be
tween the regulars and Progressives,
manifesting itself when a local photog
rapher arranged to pose the nominee,
National Committeeman Crocker "and
Chester H. Powell, Progressive leader,
together.
The Republican candidate it was
said by those with whom he talked
feels that he should not mix in local
or state issues, for the reason that he
does not desire to be involved in any
thing except a clear cut issue with the
Democrats.

Governor Hughes addressed no of
the largest gatherings he has laced
during his entire "swing round ;e

The candidate placed the principal
emphasis during his speech on a de
mand for greater efficiency in govern
ment, a higher tone of American life
and leadership and a foreign policy
that will command the respect of the
whole world. He denounced the Dem
ocratic tariff policy and asserted that
America was saved from panic by the
business created two years ago by the
European war . but added thft he ?'d
not believe that "even the European

commission. The petition In the case
filed today holds that the ordinance
Is void for the reason that It conflicts
with the Fourteenth amendment and
various other amendments to the con
stitution of the United States.
Its purpose, according to the peti
tion, is to "obtain redress for the de
privation under color of law of the
plaintiffs' civil rights."
' The Inter-state Distilling company
is a partnership composed of Leo and
Samuel Bobrecker. On one occasion
Leo Bobrecker was arrested in Kansas
City. Kan., while making deliveries.
He was taken before the police judge.
John H. Brady, fined $500 and given
six months in jail. He appealed to
the district coilrt of Wyandotte coun
ty but states in his petition that Judge
Brady has refused to certify the case
from the police court to the district
court.
He was renuired to give a bond
of $4,900 to obtain his liberty.
On another occasion Isaac Dimick,
a dj-iver for the Interstate Browing
ccmpany, was arrested, taker before
Judge Brady, given a fine of $500 and
six months In Jail. His employers
went into the federal court and asked
for Dimick's release . upon habeas
corpus. By the time- Judce John C
Pollock got to the case Dimick had
been released from jail upon order of
the city commissioners and .the case
was dropped.
The action Is against C. W. Green,
mayor: W. W. Gordon, chief of po
lice, and J. H. Brady, police judge,
and their successors.
The plaintiffs ask for a temporary
restraining order and a perpetual In

tion that the sales they make are made
in the state of Missouri and that the
delivery In Kansas is merely a part of

Earl Smith Reveals All Details
to Sheriff Kiene.
HOMER M. CULLER, HIS NAME j
Wife Granted Divorce From
Him Here in Topeka.
Hunted Man Left This City
When Suit Was Filed.
"William Hickey," the man wanted
for the murder of Walter Davis, sher
iff of Lyon county, and the Injury of
three others, and for whom a posse is
scouring; the Greenwood county hills,
is not William Hickey at all. His
name is Homer M. Culler, the county
officers say. He formerly lived in
Topeka, and it was only last March
that his wife was granted a. divorce
in the district court of Shawnee
county.
Dora F. Crider, his former wife, now
restored to her maiden name, lives at
216 East Fifth street and is employed
in a local restaurant.
Culler was in Topeka last summer
and fall but had disappeared when
Mrs. Culler filed her suit for divorce,
December 24, 1916. The divorce was
granted March 18 and service was ob
tained upon him by publication. His
divorced wfe state-l today that she
had not seen him sine 5 last September.
The former Mrs. Culler did not
know Culler was the man who shot
Sheriff Davis. She did not know
where he had been nor what he was
doing. When told of the shooting to
day, she remarked that Culler pos
sessed an unreasonable temper and
phe had no doubt he would be a dan
gerous man under certain circum
stances. At the time she lived here
with Culler she was employed at the '
Banner cafe and Culler declined to
work anywhere.
Culler is a telegraph operator and
a barber. Since his identity has been1
disclosed, it ha been, discovered that
he was employed a year or. more ago
by the Santa Fe as telegraph operator
at Wagonmoimd, Watrons and Max
well, New Mexico. An elder brother
Is cashier of a bank at Wagonmound,
New Mexico. ... ..." ; ...... .
Homer M. Culler.
The tip that led to the real identity
of the man wanted for the Emporia
murder came from Earl Smith, his
pal, who is in the Shawnee county jail.
He told his story without hesitation to
day to L. L. Kiene, sheriff, Robert
Miler, detective, and others. It is be
lieved he told a straight story from be
ginning to end. The matters it Is pos
sible to verify here have been verified.
Smith denies absolutely that either
he or Culler had anything to do with
the robbery or holdup in Emporia for
which Culler was arrested and which
was responsible for the shooting.
"I know that Is What made all the
trouble," said Smith, "but it is an ac-
tual fact that we had nothing what-
ever t(? ao wltn..lt- v e were at a pic
ever 10 uu wnn 11. we were at a pic-
ture snow at tne time I have since
learned the holdup took place. I did
not even know there had been a hold
up until I had been in jail for some
time."
Questions were asked about the
picture show and the subject shown
on the screen. He told the screen
story in detail. The title was "A Mil
lion Dollars." From the facts secured
from Emporia if Smith and Culler at
tended the show at the time Hmith
says they did it would have been im
possible for them to have committed
the hold up.
Smith stated today that he met Cull
er at Raton, N. M., Just six days before
the Emporia trouble. He stated that
Culler gave his name as Hickey but
that at one time he picked up Hick
ey's key ring and saw the name
"Culler" punched into it. He also
went to the postoffice and secured a
letter for "Culler."
Were Going to Kansas City.
The story Smith tells is that Culler
proposed that they go into some town
in Missouri and start a barber shop.
Smith explained that he knew nothing
about fcarbering. culler, ne , says,
I agreed to pay for a course at a Kan-
sas City barber college if Smith would
take the course. Smith agreed and
they were on their way to Kansas City
when they got into trouble.
Culler represented himself at Raton
to be a peiirtler and he had a lot of
knives and cheap jeweiry he was sell-
for half what he secured from the
sales. It was Smith who tipped it off
that Culler's former wife lives in To
peka. He did not know her name
but he overheard Culler talking to a
friendly station asent about his wife
and the fact that she lived in Topeka.
Smith formerly worked for the
United States Tire company at Salt
Lake City and at th.it time was able
tG giro bond, - He claims never to
have been arrested before.
Smith is 23 years of age. Culler is
22 and his former wife is 20. Culler's
mother is a former school teacher and
