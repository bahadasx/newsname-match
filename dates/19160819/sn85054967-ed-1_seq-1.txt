A Real Justice of
the Peace Was He
Solomon Had Nothing on
Squire H. Lowman When
It Comes to Real Justice.
/
Squire Hugh Lowman, of
Clarksburg, Indiana county, has
held the job of justice of the
peace in his community contin
uously since 1868, says the Punx
sutawney Spirit. Others aspired
to the title of "Squire," but when
their names were suggested the
average citizen would want to
know what was the matter with
Lowman and as it had to be ad
mitted that Lowman was a hun
dred per cent, all right, the suc
cession business was all off.
A little incident will illustsrate
the dominant characteristic of
the Lowman brand of justice:
Two neighbors were involved
in a violent dispute about the
ownership of a young turkey.
Mrs. Brown was positive the
turkey belonged to her, for had
n't she fed it every day from the
time it came out of its shell and
how could she be mistaken? Mr.
Jones said the thing was absurd,
because the turkey was the same
age and size of his- turkeys, and
besides it took that turkey to
make out the flock.
Both said they would go to
court with it before they would
give in. It was a matter of prin
ciple, they said, and they would
not permit anybody to pull off
any of that domineering stuff
on them. And so Mrs. Brown
went to Squire Lowman with
the object of bringing suit. Mr.
Lowman head her story, and
then sent for Mr. Jones, who
told his story.
"About what value do you
place on this turkey?" asked
Squire Lowman of Mr. Jones.
"Well," replied Jones, "a turk
ey like that ought to be worth
at least 50 cents."
Both disputants looked sur
prised and felt silly, and wanted
to explain, but Squire Lowman
said sternly:
. "The case is settled and court
is adjourned."

Advance Guard of
Italians Near Trieste
ROME, Aug. 17—While the
AustroHungarians are attack
ing at many points along the
front to create a conversion, the
steady progress of the Italians,
east of Gorizia, continues, with
the heavy guns slowly" but stead
ily blasting a way through the
mountain defenses of the Teu
tons.
The strongly-built trenches
on the Carso plateau, southeast
of Gorizia, are falling into the
hands of the Italians one by one.
The battle in that district never
ceases day or night and when the
infantry is not attacking the ar
tillery is bombarding.
The report that Germans are
being sent to defend Trieste is
credited here, although no foK
mal declaration of war exists be
tween Italy and Germany, Aus
tria-Hungary is desperate and
her position is getting more ser
ious daily. The Italians are driv
ing forward in two directions to
ward Trieste, one force cutting
directly eastward against the
high positions that lie at the
base of the Istria peninsula
the other in a southeasterly di
rection, in a direct line toward
Trieste.
A dispatch from Udine, the
Italian base, says that the ad
vance guard of the Italians is
only 11 miles from Trieste.

1 5 Relatives of Local
Man Killed in Wreck
At least 15 relatives of Jacob
Conner of North Seventh street,
and that many, if not more, of
his relatives were injured, in the
Jiead-on collision of two cars on
the Southern Cambria Railroad
near Echo, last Saturday morn
ing.
Mr. and Mrs. Conner had gone
to Johnstown as the first step
on the road to Woodlawn Park,
near Ebensburg, for the annual
reunion of the Conner-Disshong-
Ribblett families. They missed
the 9 o'clock car to the park,
Mrs. Conner having gone to the
store nearby, and not returning
in time. They then intended to
take the 10 o'clock car, but they
were informed that there would
be a special car at 9:30, which
car they boarded. It was the 10
o'clock car that was wrecked
and the Conners had just arriv
ed at the Park a short time when
news of the catastrophe came.
The Disshong and Ribblett
families were closely connected
with the Conners and many of
the dead and injured were first
and second cousins of the In
diana man.
