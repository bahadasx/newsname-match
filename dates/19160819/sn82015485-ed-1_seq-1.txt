0?R BIGGEST CORPORATION -
-' -. .
Nest tot? the presidency of -the
United -States, the biggest job in
America Is the chairmanship- of the
United States Steel Corporation.
Elbert Henry Gary is the bead of
a corporation empire greater in in
come . resources and aera than 1 the
average ' Europen nation. . r "
r Its incosae this year promises . ta
reacj r SSKMUMO.OOO, .. almost, equal
" revenue bf' theTTnlted
States Government or the United
Kingdom.. ' .
It has an industrial army or 275,000
men, or ; more' than- the American
army and navy combined,- more than
the entire regular and volunteer force
engaged in the Spanish-American
war, enough to plant one man every
mile between the earth and the moon
and leave enough to girdle the earth
with human milestones. Standing
side by side, the solid .line would
stretch a hundred miles: ' A w"
The corporation payroll this year
will totai 3250,000,000. Since its or
ganization, in 1901, it has paid $2,250-
000,000 in wages, r
It has a fleet or 107 steamers, which
drawn up would form an unbroken
line ten miles in length, greater ar
ray than the navy of any second rate
power. -
Its own railroad system, straighten
ed out would stretch from San Fran
cisco to New York and project several
hundred miles into the Atlantic.
Yet it pays in freight charges to the
other railroads $3,000,000 every day
of the year. Its freight bill in fifteen
years has aggregated 1,650,000,000.
It mines as much coal as the geat-
est of America's coal companies and
makes over a million barrels , at ce
ment every month. . . '
The corporation's original total cap
ita of l,4OQ.000,0Qa was. equal to
two-thiads of all the money then in
circulation in the United States.- If
Lit had beer all paid In gold the
weight would have bean 2,330 tons;
In dollar bills it would have circled
the earth six times with enough left
to stretch from northmost Alaska to
Cape Horn. , -
Its assets total 81.9000,000,000.
Over $1,000,000,000, has been paid
in taxes.
Not less than $7,000,000, is spent
annually on welfare work to make
employees' healthier, happier, safer
and therefore, more efficient. - "
Allowing five to a family, the Cor
poration supports 1,375,000 persons,
twice the population of Boston. Kx.
