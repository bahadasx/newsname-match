Representatives of this City
called on the U. 8. Dis
trict Engineer They re
ceived but little Encourage
ment.
Dr. H A King and Com in is
aioner ot Finance J P. Super
bielle were the only two Iberians
«lio conld get away on ho abort a
uolice HN was given on Monday
afternoon that Alaj. Schultz would
be in biH office the licit day at
New Orleans and would be pleaH
ed to confer with then, about the
light of way of the luteicoHHtal
l'anal. They returned Tu end ay
afternoon.
The l, ip did not result in the
giving of New Iberia's représenta
lives much encouragement Tor
their hoßes of a change of fire
route for the canal, to the advan
läge of this city. It was esplain
ed to them that should the canal
come this way, a tiOO foot right of
way would be oecessarv all the
way thtough the high land to the
bayou l'eche I'liia would tie the
condition made absolutely neces
nary through the section where
land is now high priced, for the
reason that should the Govern
meut evei after desire to enlarge
the oaual (be and along the canal
would become so high priced 4 hat
it would be a serious problem
I he only way to guard against
this possible contingency would
be to acquire the laud for future
needa at the time of getting the
first right of way.
In all probability it would be
found necessary to construct a
canal of a water line 100 feet wide
from the This
some cut for that section ruuning
through iha bayou ridge at or
near this point. It would be ex
pensive to make snch a cut here.
This is one of the principal rea
sons why the government eugi
nears prefer to keep the caual lo
cated in the coastal maintien.
Another difficulty that would
coufront the locating of the canal
this way would be the bridges
that would have to tie built for
the accommodation of the two
steam railioads, the Holley line,
and the pariah highway Much a
bridge, or bridgea, should cost a
great deal of money. The build
ers of the Interooastal Canal
would avoid snob an expense if
possible, especially where there is
a way open to them bolding none
of these very serious problems.
It is the plan to carry the canal
from Schooner Bayou to the At
ebafalaya river through the inaide
aeamarah all the way, ao as to
avoid the open atreatch of water
and the shoals of the bays. By
this means a land looked route
can be maintained all the way
across to the Texas line.
On Wednesday Maj Schultz
was a visitor to this city aud was
met by Dr. King at the Southern
Pacific depot. The visitor left
that afternoon for his Crescent
City home.

facturers are all urging publishers
every where to economise in every
way possible, as supplies arc lim
ited and prices aie certain to go
much higher. Many prominent
newspapcis of this country aie
now threatened with absolute ruin
because of their inability to buy
white paper at any price
At a meeting held August 1
publishers of all the daily papeis
of New York ami Brooklyn deter
mined to reduce the size of all then
papers, to cat off all free copies,
and to take other drastic action to
curtail the consumption of white
paper. These publishers appeal
ed to publishers throughout the
United States to take similar ae
tion at once, "since a number of
daily newspapers in every part of
the country whose contracts arc
about to expire are actually
threatened with suspension of
publication because of the inabili
ty *>f mills anywhere to supply pa

lieved that concerted action on

ers witf work to the common good,

of the country is now threatened,

In Atlanta, St. Lon is and other
cities, the daily uewspa|>eis have
not only cut off all free papers,
but have Increased the sale price
of their papers. In a number of
cities the newspapers have decid
ed to meet this situation by in
creasing their advertising rates.
It is very generally admitted by
pnbiisbeis everywhere, that the
price of white print paper will
never again be so low as it was
during the years just previous to
the outbreak of the war in Eu
rope; consequently the newspa
pers must figure upon a greater
cost of production than existed
when present snbscription and ad
vertising rates were made.
To meet this situation, and to
avoid serious financial loss, the
publishers of the leading papers
of the United States have been
compelled to reduce the size of
their newspapers, 01 to increase
either their circulation or adver
Using rates.
The New Orleans' publishers
wish to avoid either of these
courses, and hope to be able to do
so by rigid economy, the elimina

The Tecbe Fair Association,
now that the cattle tick question
bas been settled by the Police Jury's
adoption of an ordinance for tick
eradication, has decided to give a
grand Parish Fair again this year
in September, modeled much upon
the lines of the fair of last year.
Gad the Jury persisted in their
refusal to legislate against the
tick, lt*was the intention of the
Association to abandou the effort
of attempting to give another fair.
The Iberian office has been award
ed the contract for the priming of
the catalogues for this year's fair.
This matter was deoided at a
meeting of the directors held on
last Monday forenoon.
It was reported on Tuesday of
this week that there have been

HE GOT MY GOAT.
Some four hundred years agi
the city of Bologna, in Italy, wa?
a''free''city and was not bound
to pay all of the special taxiu
which the general country had to
|»ay; but certain special taxes (Id
city had to pay to the central an
tboilttes, or argne the point wit)
soldiers. The city fathers of Bo.
logna carried their authority over
a considerable country district
When these city fathers found
they were facing another special
assessment, levied by the centra!
powers, they practiced the modern
policy of "le< ting George do it,"—
thej promptly made a special tax
levy upon the hill farmers of the
suburban districts These hill
billies seldom had much ready
cash—if the authorities knew- it—
so, when these special demands
for an extra special tax came,
something energetic had to be
doue. Both parties to the deal
soon realized this.
The city fathers would send out
specially qualified expert tax.col
lectois, who were supposed to
bring back something of ready
market value, out of which the
tax niouey could be realized read

ily.
Ooe of these bill farmers, meet
ing a neighbor one day, just after
the visitation of the tax collectors,
inquired: "Did heget y out" "No,"
replied the other, "but he got my
goat."
The expression of today may
appear droll and to carry a ch
tain humor, but 400 years ago if
conveyed anything but fun lot
him who acknowledged "He got
my goat."

ferring a slight discomfort rather
than have the Chapter sink into
desuetude by inaction. Consider
