theme useless and an unnecessary
expense, nearly all the lamps are p
burned out, the globes are very d
dirty. They are simply entirely -

and dislike which we often feel S
toward them would depart. and if a
we put others in our place, our a
pride and self-conceit would very
much decrease.- Goethe.

THERE'S MONEY IN IT.
If people only knew the opportunity which is offer
ed them by a weekly newspaper, they would take
advantage of it each week and tell their neighbors
about things which they have to sell which would
be profitable to both of them. ::
Every day there are bargains going to waste be
cause the party who would like to have them, and
who is looking for them does not know that they
are within his reach. :: :: :: ::
Just a little ad. will do the work. :
-- Several young gentlemen and
ladies of the town had a nice party
at Catahoula lake this week, which
was greatly enjoyed by all who at
tended.
Several of our planters brought
samples of cane, which shows a re
markable crop up to this time, the
canes brought here would cut seven
feet now, with two and a half
months to grow.
We had another heavy rain here
Tuesday evening, which greatly in
terfered with the rice planters, and
is of great injury to the cotton
crop, and of no benefit to the cane,
which now need hot weather and
plenty of sunshine.
The engagement of Prof. M. J.
Durand of St. Martinville to Miss
Seessel Breazeale of Natchitoches
is announced, the marriage to take
in October. Prof. Duraund has re
cently been appointed principal of
the Lake Chrrles public school for
the coming session.
We have heard that all the bar
rooms outside of St. Martinville
are opened on Sundays while those
here are closed. This should not
be, all should be placed on the
same basis. Those who respect
the law and are closed, are losing
the Sunday business that the others
are doing by taking the trade away
from this place.

Tihere is ia structure which every
gr uluate from our schools is build
ing, young and old. rich and poor,
each one for himself. It is called
"character'." and every act of your
lives is a stone for this structure.
If day by day, you are careful to
build your lives, with pure upright
deeds, at the end you will stand a
fair temple, honored by God and
man. But as one leak will sink a
ship and one flaw break a chain,
so one mean, dishonorable act or
word will forever leave its impress
and work its influence on your
character.
Then let the several deeds unite
to form a day and one by one the
days grow into noble years, and the
years as they slowly pass will rise
at last, a beautiful edifice, endur
ing forever to your praise, and you
will cherish with the utmost ten
derness the memories of your
school life. The old schoolhouse,
the familiar walks about the place,
the desk upon which you wrote
your name, are all indelibly stored
away in memory never to be for
gotten.-Alexandria Democrat.

Extension Work An Important
Factor In Edncation.
Because the prosperity and hap
piness of the farmers depend upon
imnlroved agriculture-the kind
the demonstration agents are try.
ing to teach--the work of the
Sagent is among the noblest that is
I being done in the State. Such is
the opinion of State Superinten
dent of Education, T. H. Harris,
1 who addressed the demonstration
agents at their annual meeting
held at the Louisiana State Uni
versity July 81-August )... Mr.
t Harris believes that the best of re
sults will come from the activities
of the demonstration agents. He
sees many hopeful signs already.
He cites the recent legislation on
tick eradication as a concrete ex
ample of awakened public senti
ment. Such legislation, he says,
would not have been possible two
or three years ago. The sentiment
