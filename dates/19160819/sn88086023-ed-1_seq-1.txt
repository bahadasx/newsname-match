Last evening they attended the

Presidents Refuse
Big Republican
Feels Pessimistic
Over the Election
Mr. Hughes can be elected
president, but It is going to take
a lot of work by the reunited
republican-progressive party to
do it The middle west, espec
ially, must be aroused from its
present good-natured indiffer
ence So declared Dr. Nicholas Mur
ray Butler, ot New York City,
president of Columbia Univer
sity, and republican candidate
for vice president before the
electoral college in 191!!, fol
lowing the death of vice presi
dent, in an interview at the
Benson hotel yesterday.
"I have been pretty well over
the country and have made a
successful study of political
conditions,'' said Dr. Butler.
"1 think Mr. Hughes will be
elected. But it is going to take
work and the hardest kind of
of work. Let no one be de
ceived as to that. There must
be no letup in the campaign.
"It is not the coast states,
both Atlantic and Pacific, that
present the difficulty. There
must be work there, too, of
course, but the voters on the
coasts have a oetter realization
of the true situation and the
trend is very strongly for
Hughes. The great problem of
the campaign is to bring home
the truth to the voters of the
middle west, the states from
Ohio on the east to Colorado
on the west.
