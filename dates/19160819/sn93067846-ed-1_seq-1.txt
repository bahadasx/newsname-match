CANDIDATES AT MFItllE.
FANT TELLS CROWD HE IS ANTI
BLEASE IN SENTIMENT*
Cooper Replies to Attack on IUm Made
in Circular from Manning Head
quarters?-Big Crowd Present?
Blease Attacks Williams.
Bishopvillo, Aug. 15.?Unexpected
twists' and turns in campaign issues
broke thick and fast in Btshopvllle to?
day, which meeting began the final ten
days' lap of the county-i|o-county
tour.
Cole L. Blease ,the first of the live
candidates for governor to speak,
switched much of his attack relative
to the State Hospital for thO Insane
from Governor Manning directly, to
Fred C. Williams, tho superintendent
of tho institution. One letteir alleged
to have Deen written by Dr. WBllams,
was read, in which funds wei*e asked
of a patient's family that "continued"
purchases of delicacies for d* patient'
might be made. Mr. Blease charged
that the patient was already at home
when the letter was written.
John T. Duncan interrupted the
speaker long enough to ask if the
original lettor was In the possession
of the ex-governor. Mr. Blease said
ho could produce it In his1 speech
Mr. Duncan charged that it
fabrication to fool the peo]
that it was the same gag tri
Dr. Babcock, superintendent
institution, during the heat
paign of four years ago.
A telegram,; said to have h on sent
also by Dr. Williams, wad read," in
which instructions were ask?1 as to
tho dlsopsition of the body o a dead
patient and the request madejjfor suf?
ficient deposit to cover cost ot trans?
portation of tho corpse.
Mr. Blease also read a letter, said
to have been issued from fanning
headquarters in Columbia,. iand in
which the charge was made, that R.
A. Cooper was without an Ji
ho was neither for Mr.
against him, and that ho
ng second fiddle to
Mr. Cooper was mucl
the letter, partlculi
which the Laurena
j Interpreted as ichattfl
of the principles for which he4 stood
two years ago when, according to the
letter, he was in accord with those
of the present governor.
The only reference made to this
by Governor Manning was that it had
been Bent out by a friend of his and
that he had not seen the letter.
Another high light in today's meet?
ing was furnished by Albert S. Fant,
candidate for railroad commissioner,
wto came back to the stand long af?
ter he had spoken to disclaim the
charge that he was a Bleaseite. Mr.
Blease read from a bitter partisan pa?
per the alignment of the candidates.
For the office of railroad commission?
er, Mr. Fant's name led all the rest
of the alleged Bleaseites.
"I desire to set myself right with
the Democratis of my State," Mr. Fant
said, "and I state here and now that
my name Is in the wrong category.
I am an Anti-Blease man."
Tho statement by Mr. Fant drew
prolonged applause and many came
forward to commend him for his
statement as he left the stand.
The meeting today was largely at?
tended, the crowd being estimated by
many to be 1,400 or 1,500." Several
hundred of these were said to have
ben from adjoining counties, which
was amply confirmed by the number
of machines from Sumter, Darlington
and Florence counties.
Concerning the campaign letter Mr.
Cooper said in his attack upon Gov?
ernor Manning: "The charge has
been adroitly made that I have aban
j doned the principles for which I stood
two years ago. On every stump in
; this campaign I have iterated and re?
iterated that I stood exactly where I
stood then."
! That he was not a Bleaseite, Mr.
Cooper said had been emphasized pub?
licly on different occasions by Mr.
Blease and "I stated the same thing
myself at Bamberg in the presence
of Governor Manning. If his charge
is intended to convey the impression
that I am afraid to take a definite
stand, I want to ask whether Gov?
ernor Manning has heretofore under?
stood my position. If he has, why
this letter? I do not like to be
charged, by insinuation or otherwise,
and especially by a letter which I was
never expected to t;ee. I am also
classed with those who favor bad
government because I dared to offer
myself as a candidate against Gov?
ernor Mannin?. This insinuation I
resent."

I New York, Aug. 16,?Six hundred
'and four chairmen, representing all of

Carter, who left the Wilson confer?
ence to go to New York told the men
at the meeting that the situation e/ns
worse than several days ago, but there
is still room for hope. Wilson's plan
is to have the railroads give an eight
hour day and the workers to give up
the demand for time and a half for
overtime. The brotherhood execu?
tives now In Washington have no au?
thority to accept any compromise
plan. That Is the reason that the six
hundred chairmen are going, They
have the power to compromise.

Some fodder is being pulled in the
neighborhood. Also some plows are
being run to freshen up the soil in
the hopes that there may be some im?
provement in the cotton. The more I
see of actual conditions and hear
from reliable sources, the, poorer the
crop appears. Fifty per cent of a crop
is a very conservative estimate. We
fear it will run below 4U per cent.

Three Feet, as if for Heavy Shower.

the Seneca river as a result of the
breaking of the Lake Toxaway dam
did not do any damage In this vicin?
ity. The owners of Portman Shoals
power plant drained the pond above
the dam and prepared for heavy wa?
ters. The river rose only three feet,
which is nothing more than the re?
sult that comes from a heavy rain up
the watershed. The power plant has
been operating all day long and car?
rying full capacity. Large quanti?
ties of timber and trees, which had
been pulled up by the roots and de?
bris have been floating down the

take part in the work for flood suffer?
ers In this State left Columbia today
to confer with various of the county
chairmen, appointed yesterday by the
State flood relief committee. These
county chairman are to aid In collect?
ing information as to the amount of
damage left by the floods ,as well aa
to collect funds to be distributed by
the committee. The committee is em
i powered to spend money appropriated
by the federal government and well
Ina the funds collected from private
sources by the governor's office. These
latter funds the committee are striving
earnestly to increase by contributions
from the citizens of this State, espe?
cially as it is pointed out that of the
money gathered so far only about X
per cent of it has been sent in by
South Carolinians.
The money to be expended by the
committee will go only for necessaries
of life, and to the aid of those who
are in actual want, and Is not to cover
estimated property loss, which, of

sum.
