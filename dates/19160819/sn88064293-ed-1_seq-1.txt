Mi : c f. rnau River,
Speaking to the sons * i' the
dead sheriff, (Y.rrnr' told them
that when their father nttc-mp
ed to arrest him in tht cabin
where ne was staying, had not
Ohachere. deputy-sheriff shifted
his position from the original
one assigned to him by Sheriff
Swords, I would have walked in
to his arms and they would have
had me. As it was, Chachere
on seeing me fired at me and I
returned the fire and then ran
to a corn patch, followed by the
dead sheriff and his two negroes.
The sight of the latter ones
made me angry and I shot them
and when your father called out
for his deputy he revealed to me
his location, I then threw my
rifle down on him and fired and
when I saw him fall I knew all
the posse had been accounted
for. and I was then free to make
my escape.
When asked why dogs could
not trail him in the Mallet
Woods, he just laughed, and re
fused to tell of his movements
there.
He said that he did not know
(sheriff Swords and his posse
(was after him. but he thought
(that people of the neighborhood
(were after him to kill him, and
that the shooting of the dead
sheriff was unintentional.
