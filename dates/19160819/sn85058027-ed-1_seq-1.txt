The Earl.Eaglo mlno Is now break
ing about ten feet of rock each twen
ty.four hours In Its tunncl. At present
two shifts nro employed, and if tho
management decides to put in a fan
another shift will be put on.
"With tho big machlno it is possiblo
to drive an Inch and n half hole tivo
feet Into tho hard sallclous llmo in
fifteen minutes. Each shift can put
In a rffuud of holes, load and shoot
them nnd each round Is good foi
breaking five feet of ground. This
means that with 100 days work the
boro will be pushed Into tho hill 1,000
feet. It Is now In 300 feet so that by
tho end of November the big flssuro
that Is conceded to bo tho mother vein
for hundreds of tons of rich float will
havo been cut. In another 100 feet it
Is expected that tho Miller flssuro will
havo been cut. This vein Is counted
on to mnko somo flno oro bodies also.
Within tho last fow feet tho llmo in
tho face of the tunncl has become
heavily Impregnated with Iron, Indi
cating that tho Miller flssuro Is clos.
cr than wns nt first counted on.
Tho compressor plniit Is being op
erated with an oil burning engine that
has sufficient power to operate thrto
dillls, Tho compressor does not
woik perfectly, but this will soon ho
remedied and then tho Ear' -Eaglo
will commence making history. Mnn
agor C. W. Earl Is about tho most
happy man In American Fork Canyon.
