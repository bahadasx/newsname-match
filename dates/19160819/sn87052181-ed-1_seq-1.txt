CROPS NEED RAIN
The State Agricultural Board's
Monthly Report Says Corn

Wlillo Scattering showers have

tho monthly crop report of tho Mis

This report, based upon August 1

rainfall would havo been sufficient
for tho Immediate needs of growing
crops, except for tho high tempera

cxcrsslvo rains earlier in tho season,
combined to produce most unsatisfac
tory conditions.
Corn Wlillo corn has not suffered
as much from hot winds as did the
crop of 1911, tho condition, duo to
tho unfavorablo distribution of mois
ture and to tho Impossibility of pro

CLUB HELPS BUILD ROADS
Organization of St, Louis Motorists
Has Carried Four Dond Issues
in Nearby Counties.
That intelligent promotion is all
that Is required to build rock roaila
Jn Missouri, has been effectively dem
onstrated by the Automobile Club of
St. Louis. Since last December tho
club has been largely Instrumental In
carrying bond issues for roads in four
counties, and as man) moro bond Is
sues aro pending with excellent
chances of carrying. j
To accomplish all this the club has j
entirely sacrificed socJal features. Its
twenty-three hundred members, who ,
pay $10 u year oaclutw: dues, consider (
hard radial roads - centering in St.
Eouis moro important to tho city and ,
to themselves as business men than '
chicken dinners and clubhouse lux
uries. Accordingly their surplus
money Is all available for the uso of
A. C. McKibbcn, special field repre
sentative. !
Since last December ho has had for
road promotion $7,000 jot club funds
and 5C000 in special subscriptions.
This has obtained tho following re
sults: A 3 million dollar bond issue
in St. Louis county, a million dol
lar bond issue In Jefferson county, U
million dollar bond issues in Wayno
and Dent counties.
Beside this work accomplished, Bol
linger county will vote on a bond Is
sue August 15 to provide a hard road
to Cape Girardeau when it carries; '
St. Clair county, Illinois, Is to vote on
a bond issue of 3 million dollars to
start a highway eastward, and Texas,
Madison, Franklin and Maries coun
ties are all in line for bond issues.
The club has a big vision. It is
working for a 305-day highway to Lit
tle Rock and Hot Springs, Ark. Tho
Iron and Butler county gaps when
filled will carry this to the Arkansas
line. The road is already complete to
Arcadia, in Iron county, a distance of
one hundred miles.
MISSOURI DRYS CLAIM GAIN
Anti.Snloon League Expects to Control
Both Houses In the Next
Legislature.
Although both candidates for kov
ernor -Indorsed by the Missouri Anti
saloon League in the Republican and
Democratic primaries werq defeated
nt the polls, the drys of Missouri will
come out of the primary with nn as
sured majority in tho next legislature,
no matter which party carries the
stato next November.
The list of legislative candidates in
both parties, Republican and Demo
cratic, is not yet complete, but enough
nominations aro now certain to assure
a dry legislature. In only a few In
stances will there ba a dry Republican
running against a wet Democrat, or
vice versa. The opposing candidates
are either both dry or both '.vet, as
the district may be.
As a result of the primaries tho
dry's claim they have increased their
majority In tho house of representa
tives. Last session they had ninety
two members who voted dry on every
thing. Tho coming session, no matter
which party wins, the drys figure on
at least one hundred dry members,
possibly ono or two more.
The senate, which is tho battle
ground of the wets and drys and has
always been tho brewery bulwark
against tho overwhelming dry senti
ment of tho house, apparently will bo
really dry for tho first time. Tho drys
were supposed to have tho last senate
by two votes, but some of their mem
bers wouldn't stand hitched and aided
In the filibuster which defeated all
dry legislation.
Tho claim is now made that nine
teen of the thirty-four members of
tho senate will bo dry, no matter
which party carries the state.

N August .'(, 18 jciirs ago
iirii. the American army of
Illusion nun-ed forwnrd
I nun Its base on the sandy
bench before Manila and, a
few hours Inter, the fl:i!- of
Spain hud floated for the last time
over tho Philippines. An Incident of
that day which still dwells In the
memories of those who witnessed It-
lut;li t miiy have 110 nlnco In the
pages of history occurred when a
oiutiteer- regiment, chnrchicr the ene
my trenches, came suddenly under n
heavy (ire from n Spanish force con
cealed on its Hank. For a moment,
the regiment vaeiel. nnleklr how
ever, It recovered, changed its front
slightly and went on.
Brief though that period ol hesita
tion was, there was tlmo enough for
tho regimental band, still currying its
instruments, to detach Itself, by whose
order no one : -enied to know, from a
part of the line to the rear, swing
sharply out into the open, halt at.d
begin to piny. A fair target for the
enemy's flanking fire, the musicians
stood unsheltered and. calmly, nt the
word from their lender, broke Into
the fnmlllar strains of the song of
songs of that campaign 'There'll Be
a Hot Time in 1110" Old Town Tonight."
Above the crack of the rifles and tho
deeper note of the artillery, the band
made Itself heard for a quarter of a
mile along the American line. And
the soldiers, pushing forward, an
swered with a cheer, caught up tile re
frain nnd, singing It as they charged,
forced the Spanish' line backward and
captured tho Intrencbments.
It seems, in a way, to lie 11 charac
teristic of the Anglo-Saxon fighting
mnu to prefer trivial, tripping meas
ures nnd a brisk, almost flippant live
liness In their battle songs to anything
suggestive of stutellnoss, a marching
rythm, but, nsido from tbnt. whether
It possesses any other virtue, the An-go-Saxon
soldier neither inquires nor
cares. More than 100,000 American
soldiers have assembled along the Itlo
Grande. No doubt, by common con
sent, on common Impulse, coming, no
ono knows whence this army will
adopt a "song of songs" of the cam
paign. It would be decidedly unusual
if it did not.
"Yankee Doodle" Is our heritage In
the way of song from the war of the
revolution. From the war of 1812, we
have the "Star-Spangled Banner."
From the Civil war our heritage is
grcutor, nnd, unquestionably, richer.
From tho Spanish war, wo must mnke
the most wo can of "A Hot Time."
Singularly enough, though, there Is very
little recorded about tho song sung
most commonly In the Mexican war.
The soldiers ot '40 marched nnd
camped nnd fought to tho words and
tuno of "Green Grow tho Rushes." And
for tho adoption of that song, they
bad no more reason sensibly speak
ing tlian their fathers hiul wlu.n In
Revolutionary day, they lifted their
I voices In the lightsome measures of
! "Ynnkeo Doodle." As a song, it an-
swered their purpose, lllled their need,
I camo trippingly to their tongues and
1 that sulllccd.
j The Civil war was moro productive
j of genuine war songs thnn any other
, war in our history nnd, possibly, more
producllvo In that respect than any
other war In tho history of the world.
From It wo have nt least ono real war
, sons that measures up to the highest
I standards of campaign and war songs

"The Battle Hymn or the Republic"
That, as everyone knows, had Its
genesis In "John Brown's Body." But
what wns tho genesis of "John Brown's
Body," Is something that no one
knows, u was first sung, so fur as
Information runs, by the Twelfth Mas
sachusetts regiment. And, it seems,
those who .sang It borrowed It from a
eniiipmeetlng melody. As for tho ciunp
tiieetlng melody, its origin Is clothed
in mystery. Possibly It came ns n re
sult of one of the queer musical in
spirations characteristic of the old
fashioned campmeetlng singing of an
tebellum days.
The popularity of the "Battle
Hymn" was Immediate. Already the
army knew tho tune a tune singular
ly suitable for masculine voices nud
It took quickly to Mrs. Julia Ward
Howe's stanzas. A few weeks later,
East nnd West, wherever the blue
coated soldiers of the North were In
the Held tho new soni; was sung with
an enthusiasm and fervor that were
Irresistible.
Words and music were both Ameri
can, reflecting In n way tbnt defies
analysis, yet unmistakably, the soul
and spirit of America, not only of the
sixties, but of today ns well. It wns
tho first song of national significance,
moreover, that was wholly American.
"Ynnkeo Doodle's" words were set to
British music and. American though
they were, many even in Revolutionary
times refused to sing them because
of the origin of the music.
Rut, If there Is doubt about the Brit
ish origin of tho "Yankee Doodle" air,
there Is none about tho origin of the
tuno to which Francis Scott Key's
"Stnr-Spnngled Banner" Is sung. It Is
British beyond all question. In Balti
more, In 1814, "Anacroon In Heaven,
despite the fact that it balled from
London, was the popular song of tho
day as It was abroad. It Is hardly
the sort of song that would nttnln
popularity In these ragtime days, but
it btruck the fancy nt any rate of our
forefathers, and Baltimore know It
well on that fateful September day
when tho British fleet opened Pro on
Ft. McIIeury.
Aboard the enemy ship Mlndccn
Francis Scott Key, a young American
attorney, wns forced to witness the 25
hour bombardment.
In the twenty-fifth hour of the bom
bardment! the British commander sud
denly issued the order to cease firing.
It was dark, and, peer ns ho might,
Key could not make out -through the
darkness whether the order came as
a result of surrender or not, Only
Ihe coining of tho dawn would dlscloso
whether the flag still fluttered from
land to pay the ransom demnuded for
our Richard Coeur do Lion when ho
wns kept In captivity by some of our
present enemies.
The expression "worth a king's ran
som" moro probably refers to that
paid to a king. In early times, when
armies received practically no rcgu
lnr p-iy. nnd the soldlprs' reward was
tho booty taken from the vanquished,
each soldier had a right to the bodies
as well as to tho goods of tho prison
ers ho captured. The conqueror might
slay his prisoner, sell him to slavery or

As tho dawn advanced, he saw the
flag still flying. Ho has mnde tho
world realize what the words of 'The
Star-Spangled Banner" mean to us.
In the Civil war, both federal nnd
Confederate troops had a wide reper
tory from which to select. On tho
northern side, for Instance, the boys
in blue could sing not only "John
Brown's Body" or "Tho Battle Hymn
ot the Republic," but such songs as
"When Johnny Comes Marching Home
Again," "The Battle Cry of Freedom,"
"Trump, Tramp, Tramp, the Boys Are
Marching," ."Just Before tho Battle,
Mother," "Babylon Is Fallen," tind
".Marching Through Georgia."
"Dixie," with "Maryland. My Mary
hind," was the favorite song ot tho
confederacy. Of the latter, nowadays,
we hear little, but "Dixie" Is played ns
frequently us any other song of the
stormy days of the Civil war nnd no
less In the North thnn In the South.
Indeed, Its lgorous, impelling strnlns,
wherever played. North or South, aro
Invariably greeted with applause If
not with cheers. No patriotic celebra
tion, regardless of the Mason, and Dix
on line. Is complete without It.
Southern troops wero fond, nlso, of
singing "Lorena." a song notable, as
was "Just Before the Buttle, Mother,"
especially for Its note of plalntlveness.
Certnlnlv nbout neither Is there any
suggestion ot mnrtlnl characteristics.
Both were tho favorite melodies of
soldier quartets and were distinctly
camp songs.
"Dixie" can hardly bo looked on ns
a war product. "Mnryland, My Mary
land," however, In words though not
in music, was Inspired by the great
conflict. James R. Randall, a native
Mnrylander, In 1801 was In Louisiana
when word was received of thu attack
In Baltimore 011 the Massachusetts
troops. That night, alono In his room,
ho wrote the words, and they wero
published u few days later In a New
Orleans newspaper. A Richmond pa
per copied tho verses and a group of
Richmond young women, reading them,
wero Impressed, nnd began to sing
them to the German tune of "Tunnen
haum. O Tnnnenbnum." So, like "The
Star-Spangled Banner," this song of
the Confederacy borrows Its music
from a foreign source.
