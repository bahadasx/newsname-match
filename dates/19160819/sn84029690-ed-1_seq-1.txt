You hope that in the future you will have more leisure
.and more property than you have now.
That is a worthy ambition. The only way to realize it
' is to reserve a part of your earnings and turn them into
capital. They become so even while drawing interest, and
they are at hand when a way for more productive invest
ment opens.
Beginjmaking that capital now.

helped the weathers-trip business.

son who lives in Salt Lake City.

The. United States Census Statistics
CONTAINS SOME INTERESTING FIGURES
These figures show that sixty-six, read it, (66) out
of 100 people dying in the United States have ab
solutely no estate. They die penniless.
Of the remaining thirty-four (34) persons, twen-.ty-five
die with less than " $1300, and only nine (9)
persons in one hundred (100) have more than $5000
when they die.
The above figures are not estimates, idle guesses
or fiction, they are the facts, arrived at by the U.
S. Government in its Census reports.
The remedy is simple. Just save your money.
We will be glad to have you open an account

The charge from the shotgun took
effect in the unfortunate boy's throat
and death was instantaneous. The sher
iff, coroner and several other citizens,
including Postmaster Dreiling, drov
