Soon after the nominations
were made in June, when it be
came known that Teddy would
endorse Hughes, the republicans
offered a few small bets at 2 to 1
in favor of Hughes, which were
promptly taken up. But last
week $25,000 was offered on Wil
son in Xew York at odds of 2 to
1 and no republican takers at that.
Congressman C. C. Dill of this
district is the only congressman
from this state who is staying at
his job, the others leaving their
work to campaign for another
term. Dill's sincerity in doing
the work he was hired to do, re
gardless of what may happen here
in his absence, is creditable to the
man who has already brought the
results to this district which his
predecessors failed to get, and his
attention to the work of his office
is not losing any strength for him.
The democratic county ticket
w,is completed last week by the
filing of Al Miller for treasurer
and Alty. L. l'>. Donley foi-prose
euting attorney. The first com
missioner's district will nominate
al the primary, no demdbrat from
thai district making a filing for
tlir primary.
The democrats have an excel
lent ticket in Stevens county, and
with the big lead which the presi
dential and congressional candi
dates will have in this comity, past
performances are likely to be of
no value in predicting the vote
in November. The democratic
primary ticket has but two con
tests —sheriff and clerk. All oth
er filings were made after confer
ence between the desiring candi
dates.
That ex-Governor Hughes, re
publican candidate for president,
considers the state of Washington
debatable ground in the present
campaign is being emphasized in
the fact that in duo season his
running mate, Fairbanks, will fol
low him in a tour of the north
west; also that lesser lights of the
G. O. P. will be found scintillating
in the rural depths. The evidence
that the Hughes leaders have
struck the right scent is evident
from tbf fact that when the state
malitia inarched away from Spo
kane in response to the call of
President Wilson, 60,000 people
stood on the streets and cheered
them on their way. The largest
crowd reported by the Spokes
man-Review as having greeted
Hughes in his two days in Spo
kane was 11,000.
Senator George Turner of Spo
kane; Edgar D. Snyder of Seat
tle, former progressive state chair
man ; Thomas Lally of Spokane,
democratic candidate for lieuten
ant governor, and the famous Elks
Quartet of Spokane will be in Col
ville Tuesday, the 22d, and at
Marcus Wednesday, the 23d.
Meetings have been arranged for
the evening at both places, the
meeting in Colville Tuesday night
lieing in the court room.
This will open the democratic
campaign in Stevens county.
Much interest attaches to the sup
port of President Wilson by mem
bers of the progressive party, the
leading nijen of the progressive
faith throughout the country hav
ing signified their intention to sup
port Wilson in preference to the
reactionary ticket put up by the
stiindpat element of the republican
party at Chicago. Mr. Snyder of
this state is one of the progres
sives who has taken the stump for
Wilson, and citizens of this vicin
ity will be interested in hearing
his reasons for the course he has
taken.

declared himself in favor of the
reelection of President Wilson. In
a letter to Vance McCoraiek,
.chairman of the democratic na
tional committee, Mr. Colby ac
cepted an invitation to act on a
progressive committee which is to
have a cooperative relation with
the democratic campaign commit-
tee.
Mr. Colby asserts that the oppo
sition to the president's reelection
•proceeds from an unregenerate
republicanism," of which Charles
B. Bughes is a "decoy and a re
t river." If Mr. Hughes were
fleeted, Mr. Colby added, "the
old guard" would "rope him and
tie him," as they did when he was
governor in Albany, reducing him

The Spriugdale Reformer, own
ed by the Van Dissel interests, in
an article indorsing Orinstew for
judge, acknowledges that the
jndgthip should be non-partisan,
yet says that if it becomes neces
sary it "will go into certain an
cient political history in his be
half that may not be exactly pleas
ant to those most directly inter
ested."
Inasmuch as the Reformer can
didate only a few days ago re
linquished the county chairman
ship, and only last week appeared
at a republican meeting in New
port and made a republican speech
according to a letter received
from Newport on the subject, it
is evident from the Reformer's ad
mission that a strong attempt is
being made to line up a partisan
support in the campaign for su
perior .judge.
The Examiner dislikes to see
the old partisan methods brough
up again under the present non
partisan law, and can hardly be
lieve that the public will sanction
a partisan judgeship. Two of the
candidates have scrupulously re
frained from any political party
entanglements, probably losing ;i
few rabidly partisan votes there
by, but gaining a larger confidence
among the mass of the people by
.their evident observance of the
spirit of the law. A candidate
for judge certainly has the right
to any political belief he likes,
but his fitness for judge will be
partly determined by his attitude
toward the spirit of the law. Wil
son and Dill will probably poll
just as large a vote as though the
Reformer candidate kept still
about national politics.
Senator "J. Ham" Lewis, the
democratic whip, spoke in the
senate in reply to the attack upon
the administration made by
Charles K. Hughes, in his speech
accepting the republican nomina
tion.
Republican stricture! upon the
administration's Mexican policy
Senator Lewis denounced as
"treasonable." He charged that
the clause of the republican plat
form repudiating interference
with the internal affairs of Mexico
was responsible for the massacre
the soldiers at Carrizal."
"Not until the captains of the
republican party shot at the presi
dent of the United States did the
Mexican outlaws shoot at the
American soldiers," he said. The
platform declaration he character
ized as a "summons to Carranza
and Villa to revenge the entrance
of American soldiers into Mexico
and the interference of America in
her internal affairs,. It was the
republican convention which slew
slew the soldiers at (,'arrizal.
The New York Tribune is ad
mittedly the foremost Republican
organ of the United States and is
trying hard to be a staunch Ameri
can paper and to support Mr.
Hughes at the same time, but finds
it a difficult purpose to accomplish,
fn speaking of Mr. Hughes' speech
of acceptance, it comments in part
as follows:
"It would be idle to pretend
that the portion of Mr. Hughes'
address which deals with the
Lusitania massacre and our rela
tions with Germany is satisfactory
to the Tribune. Nor shall we un
dertake to make any such pre
tense."
The Tribune is with very large
Company En being dissatisfied with
the speech of Mr. Hughes, and the
Tribune and the country will also
realize that the country is not
■ inly dissatisfied with the speech
but dissatisfied with Mr. Hughes
