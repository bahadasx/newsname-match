PRESIDENT
VETOES NEW
ARMY BILL
Objects to Exemption
From Discipline of
Retired Officers.
ATTACK ON WOOD
WAS THREATENED
Measure Now in House to
Suit Mr. Wilson's
Views.
[ Fr-ra The TrtMm. Bun-flU ]
Washington, Aug. 18.-President
Wilson shocked Congress to-day by
.'toing the army appropriation bill, on
which Senators and Representatives
have been struggling since early spring.
The President's objections were not
to the bill as a whole. but to a com
paratively minor provision exempting
retired army offleer. from discpl.ne
while on the retired list for their ut
terances or acts. In hia mcssage re?
turning the measure to Congress the
President deelared that he regarded
this provision not only as si.bvers.ve
| of authority, but unconstitutional, be
i cause it limited the Executive'a control
I over the army and navy, supremely
I vested in him by the Constitution.
Chairman Hay of the Military Com
| mittee immediately reintroduced the
measure, but without the section ob
jected to by the President. He ob?
tained unanimous consent to bring the
bill before the House on Tuesday.
Revialon Left Out.
As presented by Chairman Hay. the
army bill no longer carries the revision
of the Articles of War which Presi?
dent Wilson and army men have urged
aa necessary. It was to one of these
amendments that the President took
exception.
Chairman Chamberlain of the Senate
Military Committee announced that
thc Senate would reinsert the revision
approved by the Preaident and the War
Department but strieken out in the
House. and that the situation had re
BOlVfld itself into a contest between the
Senate and House on one hand and Mr.
Hay on the other.
The tangle threatens to delay the \
adjournrr.nt of Congress, and, inci?
dentally, completion of the prepared?
ness programme, as well as to hold up
appropriations for the army increases
and all the extra expenses invoived in
thfl Mexican service.
To Protect an Officer.
Admir.istnition officials were partic?
ularly surprised at the President's ac-'
tion, bec.iuse on previous occasions he
har deelared that he was unable to
reta bill* merely because they con-;
tained sections or riders that he dia
approved. Rather than hold up meas?
ures he has thus permitted many items
to which he objected to go through.
(hairman Hay incorporated the pro?
vision exempting retired tfflcers from
discipline by the department to pro?
tect a certain officer, it is understood,
who has prepared propaganda directed
aguinst the present army stafT. A
book awaiting publication is also un?
derstood to make Central Leonard
Wood, commander of the Department
of the Kast, a special target.
The Presid.-nt's veto, one of the few
h . has cxereiscd, marks another stage
in the long fight between the army and
Chairmr.n Hay. The army charges Hay
with the d.'feat of the continental
army and univ ers.il training plans, and
the substitution of National Guard rc
orgai-ization, which it opposed. Army
officers also say certain features of the
bill Wfltfl injicted in conference and

FUNSTON PLEA
General Drops Bomb
on Administration's
Border Plans.
(Fnm Tha Trlbun* Bureau 1
Washington, Aug. 18. ? General Fun?
ston haa dropped a bombshcll in the
carefully laid plana of the Administra?
tion for a joint commission to solve
border problems. In a telegram re?
ceived at the War Department, and
which the Administration is making
every effort to keep secret. General
Funaton reeon mends the immediate
withdrawal of the Perahing expcdi
tionary fo.ce from Mexi-an territory.
In a long report the American com?
mander bases hia recommendation on
the following reasons:
The purpose of the expeditionary
force has been largcly accomplished.
The main Villa bands have been broken
up and diFpersed, nnd those still at
lar_je General Pershing is no longer
able to pursue. I'nder War Depwt
ment order." is.ucd after the Carrit'l.
affair, it is und-rstood. to prevent ai.
further clashes?he cennot move from
his line of communication except in
case of attack.
Not Needed to Prevent Raida.
For more than three months the
troops have been held in Mexico with?
out aetion of any kind. With the
militia on the border the expedition
is no longer necessary to prevent ban- j
dit raids into American territory. i
Therefore he considers their with?
drawal advisable.
The health of the troops also weighed
in General Funston's decision. He is
understood to be considerably worried
over the approaeh of the hot season ,
in Mexico and the hardships to which
the men will be subjected. With the
physical str-in they have undergone ifl
tkfl campaign, coupled with the bad ,
climatic conditions, the outbreak of an
epidemic is fearcd. Already the rate
of sickness, it is understood, is con?
siderably higher than among the troops
on thc border.
War Department officials were dum
founded when the Funston telegram
was received. It is understood copies
quickly were transmitted to the White .
House and State Department, where
the commission negotiations with Car?
ranza are in progress. Orders were
immediately issued to keep the mes
s?_c from becommg public. and Gen?
eral Funston was advised, it is under?
stood, not to wire any further recom?
mendations of a similar character.
Might Hamper Negotiations.
Should Carranza discover that Gen?
eral Funston was in accord with him
on the withdrawal of the American
troops, Administration officials realized,
the basis for the joint commission's
work would be largely swept away. On
his in; ister.ee, that issue was to be the
tirst taken up by thc commissioners.
Carr_nza's final consent to the ?
broadening of the powers of the com
misfion, it is pointed out, was condi
tional on the taking up of the troop
question first. With the American
commander himself recommending
withdrawal, it is feared Mexico mipht
disregard the commission plan alto
gether. .
The Administration has been quick to
realize the advantage to be gained by
using the expeditionary force as a lever r
on Carranza. On the First Chiefs
extreme desire to rid his country of the
American troops the State Department
has been enabled to exact effective as- !
surances for cooperation in the border
patrol. With that weapon. even after
tha military' necessity for the crossing
had ceased to exist, President Wilson
hoped the commission would work out
coiiperative measures leading to the
estiiblishment of stable government in
the southern republic.
A withdrawal of the troops, officials
realize. besidea its disastrous effect on
the campaign. would defeat the Presi?
dent's purpose of obtaining permanent
order.

Road Officials Insist Con?
victed Rioters Shall
Not Return.
Unable to reaeh any agreement aa
to tlie fourteen men to whom re
rmpleymcnt was refused at the terml
nation of the recent strike because
they hnd been convicted of misdemean
ors. the directors of the New York
Railways Company and the representa
tivea of the car men's union decided
yesterday to appeal to Mayor Mitchel
and Oscar S. Straus, who arranged the
recent strike agreement
The company wishes the Mayor and
Mr Straus to decide whether or not
the reinstatemer.t of these men is
properly a subject for arbitration. The
appenl of the union is that the men be
reinstcted at once under that clause
of the settlement providing that all
employes shall be returned to their
old posts "without prejudice."
Pending a decision, there will be no
break in the relations existing between
the men and the company, and in con
formtty with the latest agreement a
committee will meet this morning with
Frank Hedley, r-eneral manager of thfl
company, to diseuss the demands for
highir wtges and improved working
conditions recently presented.
Why Appeal Ia Made.
The decision of the company to eall
Mr. Straus and Mayor Mitchel was
reached after a long discussion be?
tween the rcpresentatives of the men
nnd ? majority of the directors, this
in turn being followed by a long exec?
utive session of the board. The de?
cision of the men to appeal Is in line
with the strike vote of Wednesday
night, in which the officers of the
union were instructed to confer with
those officials before putting into effect
the order to discontinue work.
At yesterday's meeting of the repre?
sentatives of the union and the direc?
tors the discussion hlnged on whether
jection five of the peace agreement
should be read alone, or in conjunction
with section four, and whether con
victioti of n misdemeanor in the recent
troubles affecta an employe's etficlency.
The contention of the men is that
the rcmployment clause mean* no
more nor less than it actually says.

STOMWRECKS
TEXAS CAMPS
New York Guard Loses
Tents and Many Are
Shelterless.
San Antonio, Tex., Aug. 18.-Terrific
rains driven in from the Gulf on a
West Indian hurricane have battered
down lents of the United States troops
at Brownsville and have caught the
New York militia, stationed at Mc?
Allen, Pharr and Mission.
Fort Sam Houston, at 11 p. m., re?
ported the following message from a
field wireless station erected at Mc?
Allen, Tex., via the big radio at
Brownsville:
"Half of New York National Guards
men's tents down, and nearly that
many at Llano, Grande, Mercedes and
Mission. Thirty thousand soldiers
sleeping in public buildings. Four and
one-half inches of rain fell here. There
is a lull now, but new storm is reported
coming from the east."
Wire communication with all the
border camps has been delayed by the
wind and downpour, and only the most
rr.eaf.re accounts have dribbled in by ?
wireless of the havoc worked at j
Brownsville. lt is known that the
troopa have sought refuge in thc City ;
Hali and other public buildings and
that the storm is continuing with full
fury.
For several days the hurricane hns
been brewing over the Gulf. Shortly
BftflT* reville this morning it drove in
upon the troops, who. by onlers of Gen?
eral Funston, had already moved their ;
wounded from tents to more secure
quarters.
Storm I-ess Violent.
General Funston at 9 o'clock to
night received a wireless message from
General James Parker. at Brownsville,
in which he said that tho storm at
that hour seemed to be abating and
that he thought perhaps the worst waa
over. The wind was then reported at
fifty miles an hour.
General Parker later wirelessed that
he had ordered temporary abandonment
of all military encampments. Th<- (
wooden buildings of the Iowa camp
were blown down, thc Illinois camp
was under water. the horses of the
Illinoifl guard sufTered greatly from et- ?
posure, mueh equipment had been lost
and all roads were impassable.
Advices from Dallas say that word
was received there from Corpus
Christi, however, the gale had earried
almost everything movable before it.
In its wake it had left demolished sum?
mer cottages along the beach front
here, thousands of dollars' damage to
buildings in the business section and a
heavy sea running in Corpus Christi
Waves whipped over the beach in the
northern section of the city, beachmg
small craft r.nd carrying up on th*
shore de'iri? from a score of docks and
small bathing pavilions. Lloyd's Pier,
one of tr..- iargest pleasure resorts on
that section of the coast, which juts out ;
over the water 1,000 feet. had been al?
most comple'ely demolished at II
o'clock to-night.
One Structure ______
The only portion that remained wa*
a two story structure adjoining the
shore. ...
So far as eould be learned there has
been no loss of life. Ample warning
of the storm, it was said, had been
given all residents.
No further word had been receiv.d
ofthe fate of the crew of the steamer
Pilot Boy, which was sunk in the Gulf |
of Mexico to-day in the storm. lt
was reported, however, that three men
of the crew of twelve had been washed
ashore at Port Arkansas, twenty miles
from here. '
PLAN ACCEPTED BYUNIONS;

Will Consfder Proposal, They Tell
Executive at White House
Conference.
TO CONSULT MANAGERS,
BUT INSIST ON ARBITRATION
Brotherhoods Vote Three to One to Ap
prove Settlement Plan?Publicity
if Mediation Fails.
[From a Staff Correspondent of The Tribune ]
Washington, Aug. 18.?The plan of settlement submitted
by President Wilson this afternoon to thirty-one executives of
the largest railroad systems in the country amounts practically
to an ultimatum. The four railway brotherhoods delayed their
acceptance of the President's proposal just long enough to
make it that.
The railroad presidents now have these courses open to
them:
They may stand by their managers" conference com?
mittee, refuse to accept the proposed settlement and go
before the people on their insistence on arbitration.
They may resist the President as long as they dare in
an effort to shift to the President the responsibility for
whatever may befall the roads as a result of their ultimate
acceptance of his plan.
The conference of the railroad heads with President Wil?
son was the shortest of any of the conferences since the Presi?
dent opened negotiations with both sides last Monday. Mr.
Wilson simply presented the proposition which the union* were
then accepting.
The railroad presidents did not accept or refuse it. They
merely stated that they stood by their managers' verdief that an
eight-hour day was impracticable, but would give the plan
earnest consideration and consult with the committee.

9 When the meeting of the execu
tives and managers* committee ended
to-night, one of the railroad presi
dents summvd up the status of the
case for the railroads as follov-3;
"There is no change in the deter
mination of the railroads to insist
upon the maintenance of the prin
ciple of arbitration, which they he
lieve to be at stake. They believe
that they should not be swerved from
this course hy any coercion from a
strike threat or from other influ
ences."
H-esident Wilson gave them to un
derstand, however, that ho is deter?
mined to prevent a national railway
strike at any cost. He is resohed
to reaeh some agreement acceptabla
lo both. If both refuse to come to
terms, he said, he will submit tlie
entire situation to the public. If ono
side accepts, as the case stands now,
he will tell the public the facts and
let the people say where the blame
lies.
Preaident'a l Itimatum.
The ultimatum that President Wil
so? is understood to have delivered
to the railway heads came about in
this way: Hale Holden, president
of the Chicago, Rurlington & Quincy,
spokesman for the executives, told
Mr. Wilson that the railway heads
were willing to couperato with him,
hut that their duty was threefold,
first to the public, second to the great
interests for which they were trus?
tees, and third to the 82 per cent of
their employes not repre.iented by
tne four brotherhood-.
President Wilson is said to have
replied that the paramount interest
lo bi considered was that of l'n),.
000.000 people fa this country who
1 would be affected by a genera! tie-up,
Then he added that although he waa
opposed to government ownership of
the country's transportation facili
ties, there was a very perceptible
movement in its favor supported by
a certain element throughout the
land. He impressed upon the dele.
gation his belief that this sentiment
might get added impetus by a great
railway strike.
It was aiso recalled to the execu-?
tives by the President, according to
the version of the nieetmg which
gained credence to-night, that several
years ago Krance. faeing a general
railroad strike, called the employea
to the colors and ordered them baek
to their trains. This was mentioned
not as a threat. but merely as a com,
ment on the situation here.
This veraion of the afternoori
meeting with the President was do,
nied at the White BotiM to-night,
Despite the denial it was asserted
from railroad sources that the report
was correct.
