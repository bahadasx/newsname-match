ESTERS UPON
ITS DUTIES
I From Wednesdiy'c Daily Miner
The grand jury session of the su

following grand jurors were empan
eled: David Jenkins, Monte West
lake, J. K. P. Fancher, H. S. Waite,
Ed Willis, George A. Bonelli, Charles
S. Seeley, Charles A. Bourquin, , Frank

Court's Instructions
In giving instructions to the jury,
Judge Ellis said:
Gentlemen of the Grand Jury:
You have been selected from the
body of the people for the purpose of
making an investigation of all public
offences against the laws of the state,
committed within Mohave county.
The oath that you have taken re
quires you to make diligent inquiry,
and true presentment of all such mat
ters and things as shall be given you
in charge to investigate, or which oth
erwise come to your knowledge touch
ing the commission of any public of
fence, and that in all indictments you
shall present the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, ac
cording to the best of your under
standing. The cases to be considered and fully
investigated by you are those which
will be submitted to you by the county
attorney, those of which any of you
may have cognizance, and any whichJ
may come to light during the course
of your investigations.
It is not your province in consid
ering presentments, to determine
whether the persons thus acused have
been really guilty of committing the
offense charged; that is the province
of the trial jury. Your duty is to de
termine whether there is sufficient evi
dence to put a defendant on trial be
fore a trial jury. This should be legal
evidence; such as would be competent
in a court of justice.
Your investigation of crimes is one
sided only; it goes but to the guilt of
the accused. You have no right to
presume that there will be evidence
upon the trial of the case that will
explain or contradict the evidence pre
sented to you in support of the charge.
For this reason, however, you ought
to be convinced from the evidence be
fore you, unexplained and uncontra
dicted, that it would be sufficient to
authorize a trial jury to convict the
accused of the crime with which he
stands charged, before you should find
an indictment against him.
You should receive and weigh all the J
evidence before you in any particular
case, and if in the course of your in-1
vestigation you have reason to believe
that there is other evidence which will
further explain the charge under con -
sideration, it will be your duty to or -
. , ., j jt.
der such evidence to be produced. But
you are not required to hear evidence
for the defendant.
If any member of the grand jury,
knows ,or has reason to believe, that
a public offence has been committed,
which is triable within the county, he
must declare the same to his fellow
jurors, who shall thereupon investi
gate the same.
It is your duty to inquire into the
case of every person imprisoned in
the jail of the county on a criminal
charge and not indicted, or against
whom an information has not been
filed; and you should inquire into
every wilful and corrupt misconduct in
office or public officers of every de
scription within the county. You
should also inquire into the condition
and management of the public prisons
within the county; and you are en
titled, at all reasonable times, to free
access to the public prisons, and to
examination, without charge, of all
public records within the county.
You have within the scope of your
inquiry all public offences committed
and triable within the county, and,
though you take up and investigate a
charge against one person, if it ap
pears from testimony taken on such,
examination that sufficient reasons

E
PARTY AFFILIATIONS
V
AFTER REGISTERING
(From Oatman Section Daily Miner.)
Voters who have registered as mem
bers of one political party and who
wish to change their registration to
that of members of another party may
do so, provided they call at-registration
offices and request the change
before the close of registration Sep
tember 1', which is the time for the
closing of the books prior to the pri
maries. This applies to voters who
have registered as non-partisans or
to those of any party who wish to
change from one to another. Those
who have registered as non-partisan
could not have a vote in the primaries
otherwise, hence the events leading to
this change.
The new interpretation of the state
law comes in the form of an opinion
rendered by the attorney general and
is sent out by the county recorders
o fthe state. The question was raised
in Cochise county and from there put
up to the attorney general. The fol
lowing letter has been received by the
Oatman registrar:
"Hon. H. M. Caswell,
Oatman, Arizona.
Friend Caswell The following tele
gram just received by Mr. Herndon
is self-explanatory:
'"Phoenix, Arizona,
August 10, 116
"'C. W. Herndon,
County Attorney,
Kingman, Arizona.
"'Have just advised county attorney
of Cochise county that persons reg
istering as non-partisan or with some
other party may re-register and
change party before registration
closes. '
'"WILEY E. JONES,
Attorney General."
"Under this ruling an elector can
change his party affiliation by cancel
ing his former registration on blank
'B' and then re-registering on blank
'A' at any time before the register
closes, September 1, 1916.
Please explain this to the electors
of your precinct.
Yours very truly,
"J". W. MORGAN.
"P. S. In re-resristerine an elector
under the'above ruling be sure and
seal the blank 'B as well as the dup
licate blank 'A' and send to this
office."
Not many voters have registered in
Oatman as non-partisan. Mr. Cas-
I well states that there have been a
1 number at Yucca and a few scattered
! ons throughout the county.
, "stratum "5
man precinct yesterday had readied
,743 For there been
, ten a day, or 60 for the week. Mr.
Caswell does not believe at the out-
side there are more than 100 more
entitled to register. He makes a vig
orous effort by personal appeal to
get the voters in and it has had its
effect. Candidates for office are work
ing hard to the same end and bring
them in frequently in twos and fours.
Women are said to have registered
as a rule as promptly as men. It! is
a" very large showing, taken in the
form of a percentage of a total num
ber of votes of the precinct, but-jt is
claimed that such is but a fair re
presentation of the amount of interest
being taken in the primary light.
When it is considered that not more
than one in four or five persons in
Oatman has been in the state long
enough to vote the surprising strength
numerically of the precinct may be
better understood.
Thus from now until the day of
closing the books there may be quite
as much work for the registrar in
changing affiliations as in that of
entering new names. That depends
upon the number of non-partisan reg
istrations, for no others are expected
to make application for a change.
Very few, indeed, not over three in
fact, have had their registrations
transferee dto other precincts and
about an equal number have regis
tered here as belonging to other pre
cincts, which is permissable under the
law.
!ES
AT GREAT DEPTH
The Boundary Cone has struck its
ore shoot on the 750-foot level that
1 it had on the 550. This was indicated
a few days since when the Daily Min
er reported the disclosure of the ledge.
Values were not given then and are
not now. They will not be given un
til the ledge has been crosscut . That
is being done. The crosscut has gone
into the ledge 15 feet and is making
headway.
j Pannings are very good rich in
i fact. It is unquestionably ore, accord-
ing to pannings and an important
strike. The company has the ore at
550 and, this is its downward trend
land apparently at least as rich and
maybe richer. It will be told in full
when the hanging wall is reached.
This should be a matter of a very
! few days.

The Wallapai valley is taking on a
mantle of green since the recent rain
storms and within the next ten days
the whole country will look like unto
a meadow.. Every depression is filled
the water and the dams have been
fiiled to overflowing.
J. M. Vassar, who formerly" was in
charge of a property in the Oatman
section, came in from San Diego yes
terday.
THIS GAMP, SAYS
OWNER OF CLAIMS
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner.)
'It has Oatman 'skinned' in a thou
sand ways," said J. S. Harrison yes
terday in a burst of enthusiasm over
the mineral richness of Union Pass.
"Everybody who is working there is
working on ore. If they hayen't ore
to work on they don't work. In Oat
man they! have to sink to a great
depth before they get ore to work on.
Umon Pass seems to be about as rich
as Oatman and the ore bodies are a
great deal larger. They are found at
the surface, which makes that extra
sinking unnecessary. It is going to
be an immense big camp with im
mense big ore bodies and I look for
a large population there this fall. It
may depend upon a renewal of acti
vity in Oatman and it may not, for
something may be struck out there
that will attract attention indepen
dently of Oatman and be a benefit
to both places."
Mr. Harrison has long been known
as an enthusiast over the greatness
of Union Pass and a high-geared op
timist at all times over the mining
situation in general. As a sample of
his enthusiasm he is the owner of sev
eral hundred interests and claims at
Union Pass. Some are in the hands
of partners. Many of them are under
bond to other parties, generally capi
talists who have agreed to develop
them. A few more he sold during the
past summer for cash. And some
he is working himself-
The Frisco mine, he reports, has
been started under a new regime and
with a good force of men, with a
determination to do lots of develop
ment. It has started a tunnel to tap
a big lead that has a northwesterly
and southeasterly course and is the
main lead of the country. It show!
continually on top and yields assays
of $70 to $80. The tunnel will gain
a depth of 100 feet. It is in the hands
of New York people with a Los An
geles man in charge.
The Oatman-Revenue has a particu
larly good showing, according to Mr.
Harrison. Its values, he states, will
average $16 a ton and there is an
immense amount of ore. A hoist will
be had soon.
The Banner is working and down
60 to 70 feet. It is sinking on the
footwall and is very rich indeed, a
wonderful showing. The ledge is 80
feet'in width. H. L. Vaughn is in
charge for San Diego people who have
plenty of money.
The Thumb Butte is workine and
is down 540 feet A. B. Daniels, a
California millionaire, has it. He
bought twelve adjoining claims this
summer from Mr. .Harrison. Daniels
is crosscutting at the 500 and will
iv to jro 70 or 80 feet. At the 200
the ledge measured 74.7 feet of solid
ore. said to run better than $10.
There are spots of very rich ore. A

ILL SOON START
L
(From Oatman Section Daily Miner.)
Under the personal supervison of
General Manager George R. Hannap
and Consulting Engineer Uoy Cornell
the Tclluriae Chief Mining compnnv
is making rapid progress toward plac
mg its propertv in the Wallapai
mountains, about 15 miles east of
Kingman, in the mine class. Dame
Fortune ha3 seemingly smiled upon
the efforts of the management since
the development work was begun a
little more than four months ago, and
the results achieved warrant the pre-
aiction that the property is destined
to develop into one of the big mines
of the county.
The vertical shaft on property has
gained a depth of approximately 220
feet. Allowing .20 feet for a sump, the
cutting of a station is rapidly being
completed at the 200-foot point and
within the next few days crosscutting
will be started to the west to disclose
the dowward extensions of the Gam
ier and Big Swede veins, both
which have truly remarkable surface
work, both should be cut with approx
imately 80 feet of crosscut work on
the 200-foot level. To facilitate such
work, the force of miners will be in
creased from 15 working in two shifts
to 20 in three shifts.
As soon as the ledges have been
completely intersected, the company
intends to install a 500 cubic foot com
pressor and machine drills and prose
cute the exploration of the ledges with
drifts, raises and winzes with all
possible despatch. There is little
doubt that such workwill be crowned
with the most gratifying results. This
statement is based upon the achieve
ments of the management in its sur
face operations. Despite the fact that
the vertical shaft has been sunk a
considerable distance from the veins,
the country rock through which it has
passed from the 70 foot point to the
present bottom has averaged better
than $12 per ton. A sample taken
a day or two ago in the station cut
ting gave a return of better than $50
per ton in gold and copper.
It is the intention of the company
to install, as soon as sufficient dev
elopment work has been accomplish
ed ore blocked out to warrant a 75
ton daily capacity oil flotation plant.
With such an equipment, there is
every reason to believe that the prop
erty will be placed upon a producing
basis early after its installation.
the chunk went $11,000 a ton.
The Arabia company is figuring on
a milL From the water level at 80
feet to the surface it has ore enough
to pay for the mine and build a mill.
The vein is 100 to 300 feet wide and
assays throughout.
The Catherine company is arrang
ing to start soon also. Charles Sher
man is at the head of the company
and will have charge.
The High Grade property has been
sold to a concern at Los Angeles by
George Bonelli and Lon Ferra. The
Los Angeles people are represented
by Harry Chandler, manager of the
Times. It produced 'some exceedingly
rich rock earlier in the summer.
The Arataba, which is being finan
ced by Mrs. J. C. Garinger, is an
extension of the High Grade.
The country is mineralized all the
way from Oatman and away south
of here, in fact, to Union. Pass and
beyond. Mr. Harrison defines the
limits of Union Pass properties as ten
miles in extent. All of this has values
on the surface, he declares, the whole
thintr being a great mineralized zone.
It differs from Oatman in being
strictly a contact country, with' an
desite, rhvolite or Dorphyry hanging
and granite footwalls.

reserves of the mine. This could be
done by sinking to the 800 or
level.

At that depth the new shaft, which
is designated as No. 2 and is the one
with the 75-foot gallows frame on the
hill, should drop into the ledge. As
to values of depth, that has already
been proven in the Tom Reed, and the
Goldroad also for that matter, and the
Eastern has them down with greater
widening and amply rich for milling
to the 665-foot level.
The reserves of the mine have been
a subject of no little discussion of late.
It has gotten into public print, but
that is only one of the slightest evi
dences of the amount of discussion on
the same topic in the inner circles of
the company. One idea is to make the
figures inclusive and the other ex
clusive. The latter prevails and as
a policy has the official stamp of the
company, but officials who are re
sponsible for it have said to associ
ates: "Of course, there are other ways
of figuring it, and you can figure it
otherwise, if you like." The adopted
policy, however, is to take absolutely
no account of reserves unless cross
cuts from wall to wall are actually
there and finished. This means elim
ination of hundreds of feet of drifts
with as good values on an average,
but the blocking of which by ledge
crosscuts has not been done. There
are ends of such description to all
drifts. There are also various places
where one level has run out the ore
further than another, either above or
below as the case may be, with none
of these "extras" counted
Then what is more astonishing still
is that only 50 feet between levels are
reckoned to have the same values as
the levels themselves. The others have
been deemed to be there and their val
ues have been computed at exactly
one-half the level values. Anyone can
see that a mistake is possible, for the
values may be only one-third after 50
feet and the company, therefore, may
be giving the mine the best of it.
The management states that the
reason that such ratings are made be
tween levels is the fact that raises
have not been put up to connect them
ever 50 feet in order that the ore may
be sampled. As a matter of course
that would mean, to be still more ac
curate, that a cross drive in each one
should be put through from wall to
wall. With that done there could be
no question as to whether the rating
of one-half is too high and that of
one-third should be submitted.
As these calculations apply to the
spaces between four or five levels,
without taking into account any ore
whatever Delow the 665, it can be seen
that the discussions have dollars be
hind them.
The company caused the publication
of an article in a mining journal figur
ing the reserves after that manner.
It was written by direction, submit
ted to officials before going to print
and, therefore, has the stamp of au
thorization as being conservative.
Taking all of these facts into con
sideration, it can be seen how the
range of reserves has been stated to
be as high as $15,000,000 and as low
as $5,000,000. Yet other persons in a
position to know detailed facts say $9,
000,000 is far too low to even be con
servative. With the intrinsic value of shares
based upon these figures it comes as
a part of the conservative reckoning
of the company that they should be
worth $5 each at this time. Ask em
ployes of the executive departments
and they will name that figure. Oth
ers are more liberal and say they
know Mudd, Jackling and Keith offer
ed Long & Mclver $7.50 for every
share they own and claim that should
be the market value now, based on
the showing in the mine. Still others
say $10 should be the quotation and

it is not only the best buy in Oat
man but on the face of the earth. Like
the reserve figures, any person has
a right to his choice, but any of them
can still further strengthen or
weaken his position all he cares to
by making use of the further obvious
fact that by three months sinking the
reserves could be doubled.
Shaft No. 2 has been sunk with
rapidity since the new gallows frame
was placed in commission. It is now
down 485 feet and a raise from what
will be 590 feet below the collar of
the shaft is up 70 feet. This indicates
that in four days or less the shaft will
be complete, with the first air connec-
tion since the mine was discovered.
This is a fair sample of results that
are being attained to the general sat
isefaction of all concerned by the
present efficient management. It then
will be the working shaft of the mine.
It will hoist all the ore for the mill
when it shall have been completed.
NEW MACHINERY FOR
THE COPPER GRANT MINE
William Neagle was in Kingman
Monday on business connected with
the Copper Giant mine, near Hack
berry. He reports that the newer and
more complete plant of machinery will
be on the property soon, when the
work of opening another shaft will be
undertaken.
The property is one of the big
things of the county and it is ex
pected to have it producing heavily
by December. The recent heavy rains
washed out the road to the mine, but
a number of men are now engaged
in making repairs, which will be com
pleted in time to allow the bringing
In of the machinery.
DECLARED "UNFAIR"
TO ORGANIZED LABOR
The Kingman Publishing company,
publisher of Our Mineral Wealth, hav
ing, it is charged, refused to pay the
union scale of wages and recognize or
ganized labor, the one member of the
Oatman - Kingman Ty opo graphical
union, No. 758, heretofore employed in
the shop of that concern, has been
called out.
For several weeks, according to
President Paul Booth of the union, ef
forts have been made to "show the
light" to the owners of the Kingman
Publishing company shop, persuade
the m to unionize it and pay the union
scale of wages. The union officials,
it is claimed, have been put off and
"stalled" with one or another excuse.
Becoming weary of their efforts, the
union members took a vote and, as a
result, delivered an ultimatum to tho
Our Mineral Wealth proprietors or
agents, to the effect that if they did
not give assurances by a certain time
that they would recognize the union
and pay the scale of wages prescribed
for its members by it in Mohave coun-
the one member of the union would
be called out.
The time set for the .answer passed
without the union receiving a favor
able reply to the ultimatum. About
an hour later, according to President
Booth of the union, F. A. Wilde, jr.,
secretary of the company called the
former up over the telephone and in
formed him that the concern had de
cided not to unionize ts shop. Forth
with, the union printer employed by
the concern to operate its linotype ma
chine was called out and the shop de
clared "unfair." The other officials
of the Kingman Publishing company
are: President, F. A. Wilde, of the
Desert Power & Water company; vice
president, Allen E. Ware of the Tarr,
McComb & Ware Commercial com
pany. '
As previously stated in these col
umns, the Mohave Uounty Miner
Printing company, publishers of the
Mohave Daily Miner and Mohave
County Miner (weekly), is the only
union printing shop in Kingman and
one of three union shops in Mohave
county, the other two being the Oat
mafc News and the Oatman Miner. All
other print shops in Mohave county
are "scab" or "rat" shops.
