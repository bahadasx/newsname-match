Eight-Hour Day Practical
And Fair, Says President
WASHINGTON, Aug. 19 In a statement outlining his plan
of settlement of the threatened railroad atrike. President
Wilson declaies the program "thoroughly practical and en
tiiely fair, and the public has a tight to expect its acceptance."
President Wilson's statement follows:
"I have recommended the concession of the eight-hour day
that is, the substitution of an ei;ht hour day for the present ten
hour day, in all the existing practices and agreements. I made
this recommendation because I believe the concession right. The
eight-hour dav now undoubtedly has the sanction of the judgment
of society in its favor and adopted as a basis for wages even where
the actual work to be done cannot be completed within eight
hours.
"Concerning the adjustments which should be made, in jus
tice to the tatlroads and their stockholders, in the payments and
privileges to which their men are now entitled (if such adjust
ments are necessary) there is a wide divergence of opinion. The
railroads which have already adopted the eight hour day, do not
jifem to be at any serious disadvantage in respect of the cord of
Yperation as compared with the railroads that have retainsd the
ten-hour day and calculations as to the cost of the change, must,
if made now be made without regard to any possihle administra
tive economies or readjustments.
"Only experience ran make it certain what rearrangements
would be fair and equitable eithejr. on behalf of the men or on
behalf of the railroads. Thst experience would be a definite guide
to the interstate commerce commission, for example, in determin
ing whether, as a consequence of the change, it would be necessary
and right to aiithorlre an increase of rates for the handling and
carriage of freight (for passenger service is not affected.)
"I, therefore, proposed that the demand for extra pay for
oveitime made bv the men and the contingent proposals of the
railroad authorities be postponed until the farts shall have taken
the place of calculations and fotecast with regard to the effects
of a change to the eight-hour day; that, in the meantime, while
the experience was developing, the facts, I should seek and if need
he, obtain authoiity from congress to appoint a small body of
impartial men to observe and thoroughly acquaint themselves with
the results with a view to reporting to congress at the earliest
possible time the facts disclosed by their inquiries, but without
recommendation of any kind; and, that it should then be entirely
open to either or both parties to the present controversy to give
notire of a termination of the present agreements with a view to
instituting inquiry into suggested readjustments of pay or practice.
"This seems to be a thoroughly practical and entirely fair
program and I think that the public has the right to expect its
acceptance."

"What have you up your sleeve'"
Committees from the Fort Worth

question.
Similar committees from the local
Chamber of Commerce and clearing
house asked the second at a meeting at
noon today in the I.ee-Muckins hotel,
at which the Texans were self-invited
guests of the local men.
To Learn Attitude.
The Tort Worth delegation, which
arrived this morning, came here pri
marily to ascertain the attitude of Ok-
composed of lexas and Oklahoma and,
perhaps, another state, provided Okla
homa City was willin'.
While no definite ansxver had been
given 'the Texans at 1 o'clock, it xvas
virtually conceded that this city would
not be willing to accede to the propo
sition but would continue her present
campaign for aliank district composed
of Oklahoma, Kansas anil Arkansas.

Chamber of ( ominrrr; officials be
lieve'that with this prospective leiiml
of the Texans' proposition, both 1'orl
Worth and this city can now proceed
with their respective campaigns, know
ing exactly the attitude of each other.
l-'ort Worth probably xvill confine her
efforts to have approved a district com
posed of Texas and Louisiana.
