,Fi htina Germans" a~t eile Uem 'lu

Sher an said it!
y a is all he said it was.
Yoa will agree with Sherman when
you *e "l'he Fighting Germans,"
real war pictures of ac ual strife,
which will be shown a the Gem
''Theiat're tunlorrow.
These are the much commented
upon motRn pictures of the carnage
ac rr seas which caused concentrat
Sedfort to have the United States
suppress their showing. Forbidden
.cenes held to have slipped past the
Clesors are part and parcel of this
Magnificent pageantry of warfare.
-The Fighting Germans" will bring
the warring nations before the vision
of the observers at the Gem in a
manner in which actual war has
never before been presented. These
authentic films were obtained for the
Mutual Film Corporation by a daring
cameraman who braced death with
almost every scene he snapped.
Whatever has been written about
the fall of Warsaw, however graphi
cally was described the Teutonic as
sault against the Russians in Poland,
nothing can begin to reveal the con
ditions in that devastated country
like the films which A. K. Dawson
took at the risk of his life. The re
productions of what this intrepid
newspaper correspondent saw at the
front, under cover of Gen. von Hin
denburg's big guns, will be shown.
Once on the battlefield, evidences
of war appear everywhere. There are
no stage scenes, nor does the pic
ture contain an eternal parade of
soldiers marching from nowhere to
nowhere with artillery and cavalry in
the procession, listlessly advancing
with the consciousness that they are
having, their pictures taken. Here
the men proceed, unmindful of the
camera's grind, with determination
written over their countenances, their
jaws set and their keen and alert
faces seemingly eager to get a view
of their enemy. Of course the lighter
phases of life with the fighting men
show them in a different mood. Ex
cept for their uniforms and surround
ings, an observer, seeing these men at
play, might forget that he is viewing
the stern realities of war and think
he sees a happy lot of campers.
Never have motion pictures given
a more vivid impression of a battle
than these Dawson films or a more
comprehensive visualization Qf activi
ties at the front. In full view of the
ka n -sectionns-some one or two
miles away from the lens can be plain
ly seen by their outlines.
Columns of men dash.forward over
the hills and plains, through ditches
and across pools of water, knee deep,
under cover of the big guns, to get
closer to their goal, while the enemy's
shells burst all around the advancing
soldiers, leaving trails of smoke in
midair like giant sky rockets and
tearing up the earth wherever they
strike. When the soldiers neared
their destination and fixed their bay
onets for the final assault, the camera
man sagely withdrew to the rear.
The destruction wrought by the
heavy Teutonic guns is seen. As the
conquering army enters the Polish vil
lage the citizens can be observed gaz
ing on the invaders with curiosity and
awe and later, in friendly chat with
them. The plight of the refugees
who leave their homes with the re
treating Russians only to return and
find their abodes in ruins is shown.
Babies gaze curiously into the cam
era's eye, possibly attracted to it by
the grinding of the handle, while
proud mothers urge their offspring to
look pleasant as their pictures are be
ing taken.
The kaiser and the crown prince
emerge from the palace just as the
camera man appears on the scene,
and before they enter their convey
ance he had their likeness on the
tid. From this peaceful and beauti
ful city Dawson goes to the hotbed of
the strife, armed with the necessary
credentials and withlAmerican pluck
and perseverance. :long the way he
snaps Russia prisoners at work on the
roads, piling up hay and engaged in
other employment under the supervi
sion of their German captors. They
ceem contented.
The Austro-Iungarian troops who
withstood the brunt of the early days
of the battle are seen starting into
action. Charges on Russian trenches
over a battlefield in which thousands
of shrapnel shells are bursting, the
aerial fleet directing the gunners, the
Zeppelins hurling bombs on the
trenches and outer forts the surren

the events that make tls picture a

three B g Stars in "By Whose
Hand?"
"Who killed Simon Baird?" That
is what everyone will ly asking when
they see "By Whose Hand?" in which
Edna Wallace Hopper, Charles .Ross
and Muriel Ostriche will be se n at
the Gem next Tuesday. The fact that
such a trio of recognized stars ap
pears in "By Whose Hand?" proves
immnediately that the picture is an ex
reptionally strong one as to story and
plot. There is more action in each of
the five reels of this Equitable fea
ture than is generally found in a
whole tive or six-reel production.
From the opening flash until the clos
ing fadeout there is not an idle mo
In "By Whose Hand?" Simon Baird
is brought face to face with three per
sons whom he had wronged twenty
years before. When he comes to buy
an invention from David Sterling,
sweetheart of H, len Maitland, he
shows five $1000 bills, one of which
has been torn and then pasted to
gether. Both Helen and David notice
this. That night. Simon Baird dines
With the Maitlands and sleeps t wre
He had wronged Mrs. Maitland when
she was a girl. She recognizes him,
but denies to her husband that she
does. The husband also sees in his
features "a gr ilarity to those
of the man i o ad robbed him
twenty years l re. Kimba, the
colored serva lnetrates Baird's
disguise, and ie he scar on his
chin that was nplifnted there by
Maitland when Baird had lashed him
(Kimba) with a mule whip in the old
mining days.
That night, Simon Baird is mur
dered. The next day David Sterling
has in his possession the torn and
pasted $1000 bill which had been in
Baird's wallet the day before. He is
arrested, pleads not guilty, and is
brought to trial.
Helen says she knows nothing of
the crime. Mr. Maitland denies any
knowledge of it. Kimba pleads igno
rance. Mrs. Maitland, breaking
down, admits having committed the
deed. Then, in quick succession,
Sterling, Mr. Maitland and Kimba
claim to have killed Simon Baird.
Who killed him? For the first time
in the history of filmdom the audience
will he the jury and will decide the
fate of the hero. Time will be given
to render a verdict, after which the
picture will be continued to its logical
ending.
"The Shadow of Doubt."
If you cmpL. into y r house after
you had in lhed yo ife you were
leaving on a trip out of town for a
few days, and found one man dicker
ing with your safe, had him arrested,
only to return and find another man
in your bed chamber, with your wife
in the house all' the time, would any
doubt of your wife's faithfulness en
ter your mind? These are only a few
of the many problems which are in
telligently worked out in the Equita
ble five-reel feature, "The Shadow
of Doubt," with Carlyle Blackwell ini
the leading role. Moreover the de
velopment of the story proves that
both men were there for legitimate
reasons, which adds vim to the punch
of the strong, dramatic climax in this
extraordinary Blacl:well picture, to
be shown at the Gem next Thursday.
Viola Allen in "The White Sister."
After repeated attempts to book
this magnificent picture, Proprietor
Von Lotten of the G;em has finally
succeeded in' securing the film for
announcemnent wi f be received with
intense gratification by the patrons
of the popular house, since the pro
duction has created a sensation
wherever shown and is universally
conceded to be one of the very finest
achievements of the motion picture
art. Viola Allen plays the title role,
with Richard C. Travers as leading
man and an all-star supporting cast.
Six reels are required to tell the
story of "The White Sister"-six
reels that are crowded every moment
with the hurrying events of a great
life drama. The pictures are superb;
the costumes are correct in every de
tail; the scenes are perfectly laid as
to atmosphere. There is nothing
missing, nothing wanting in this most
beautiful and wonderful of motion
pictures. Many thought the limit of
perfection had been reached in the
stage production of the famous play,
but the film version is even greater
and better, because Viola Allen has,
before the .reen, done the greatest
work of h .llustrioulreer.
The sto of "The hite Sister,"
in brief. is as follows:
Diisinherited, iliegitimateo unaer tne
Italian law-her lover reported dead
in Africa-heartbroken and weary of
the world-Donna Angela Chiaro
monte becomes the White Sister, de
voting her life to good and the ser
vice of the Master. Called to nurse
her dying aunt, Angela learns she was
disinherited because the aunt stole
her father's will. After five years,
Lieutenant Giovanni Severi, the lov
er, returns as from the dead. Seri
ously injured in an explosion at the
barracks where he is stationed, he de
termines to die unless Angela will
marry him. She loves him more than
she loves her life, but refuses marri
age because of her vows as the White
Sister. A prince of the church inter
venes and promises to obtain from His
Holiness the Pope a dispensation that
will free her from her vows and allow
her to marry. This brings happiness
to everyone, including the sister su
perior of the convent, who, Angela
has learned, is her real mother, and
sister of the woman who she always
thought w er parent. It is the
most beauti story ever written of
a man's dev n airt a woman's self
s:acrifice.
"An emy to Society."
The eminent English actor. Hamil
ton Revelle, and the dainty prima
donna, Lois Meredith, will be seen at
the Grand Theatre tomorrow in e
superb photo-adaptation of George
Bronson Howard's thrilling story,
"An Enemy to Society."
In an effort to revenge himself up
on Stephen Janissary, a modern Na
poleon of finance, who has ruined him,
Balthazar &an Tromlcidnaps Janis
sary's infant son, Stephen, "Big
Steve." as the financier is called, vaii
ly spends fortunes to find the child,
whom he had planned to make his
heir. But the wily Van Tromp de
feat:. all his efforts.
The lad is raised as Stephen Adams,
an enemy to society. His preceptors
are crooks who instruct him in the
principle that it is noble to steal from
the rich to give to the poor. Grown
to manhood, Stephen idealizes his
criminal craft and looks upon him
self as a modern Robin Hood.
turning from a rich haul in
F ,on shipboard he meets Decima
, the beautiful daughter of Ben
ss, Janissary's old business Pf_
e d ..S
ner, at wlhse death Janissary became
the girl's guardian. D ima and
Stephen have a commo4 cause in
their interest in the poor *nd their
friendship quickly ripens into love.
Meanwhile Janissary, vgo has
crushed many since he attacked Van
Tromp, glans to crush others. Docu
ments i his safe will convict certain
men of criminality, long since for
gotten. Through the palters he seeks
to bend these men to his will. Deci
ma and Stephen both have a strong
interest in one of Janissary's pros
pective victims, and when Decima
tells Stephen that the incriminating
papers are in her guardian's safe, he
determines to steal them, as his last
illegal act.
Then Van Tromp gets his revenge.
He betrays Stephen. When Janissary
has him arrested, not knowing his
identi r, Van Tromp triumphs in dis
closinf to him that the robber is his
own son. HK tells Janissary that for
making him a pauper, he has made
Janissary's son a thief.
Janissary, overcome by the revela
tion, shoots himself. An old will is
found which leaves Janissary's entire
fortune to his son, so Stephen and
Decima marry and devote themselves
and their millions to helping the poor.
Fannie Ward in "For the Defense."
No star of the legitimate stage
who has entered the greater field of
photoplay acting has achieved, with
in so short a time, the extraordinary
success that has come to Fannie
Ward, the famous American come
dienne. Her first appearance on the
screen was in the delightful comedy,
"The Marriage of Kitty." Then in
succession followed "The Cheat," the
sensation of the year; "Tennessee's
Pardner," and now, "For the De
fense," in which the versatile star will
appear at the Grand Monday.
In this production Miss Ward im
personates a petite French girl who,
coming to this country as a stranger,
is suddenly thrown into the midst of
a great tragedy. By an accident she
becomes the sole witness to a murder
for which a young man, unknown to
her until he later assists her, is ac
cused. When this man, who has
kept secret from her his true identity,
is later accused of crime, none but
the little French girl is able to prove
his innocence. The scenes of "For
the Defense," are laid in New York
and in the beautiful west. It is a
story of great suspense from begin
"The Code of Marcia Gray."
There are many forms of moral
honor, and every woman has her own
individual code of ethics to govern
various situations. The code of
Marcia Gray, the basis for the Oliver
Morosco photoplay of that name
which comes to the Grand Wednes
day, will win ready sympathy. Sud
denly deprived of her life of refine
ment and luxury by the cowardice of
her husband at a crucial moment,
Marcia finds but one solance-Or
lando Castle, her former sweetheart,
and friend of her husband. Marcia's
code meets a great and unexpected
test-not from the usual triangle of
two men and a woman-but in what
makes one of the strong, human mo
ments in a charring production.
The wonderful personality of Con
stance Collier as Marcia Gray makes
the part one of universal appeal.
Every woman will find in the great
crisis in Marcia Gray's life a marvel
ously exact duplication of what she
would have to do, and experience,
should she meet the same problem.
"May Blossom."
David Belasco's celebrated stage
success, "May Blossom," as picturized
by a Famous Players cast, will be the
Friday attraction at the Grand. The
sympathetic and realistic photo-ver
sion of this great American war
drama will undoubtedly revive the
interest so universally created by the
original stage @roduction. Its tender
romance, its frank presentation of
problerg familiar in our domestic
life, ant its thrilling military aspects
of the great national struggle of a
half-century ago, combine to make
this one of the most typical and ap
pealing American plays ever pro
duced. In the photoplay the pictorial
and scenic possibilities of the big
drama are remarkably enhanced, and
the interest of the stirring plot is
greatly strengthened by the more
elaborate presentation made possible
on the screen.
"May Blossom" impressed the na
tion with its power and charm. The
photoplayAwill make this great Belas
co succe. completely unforgetable.
Other Grand Attractions.
Tuesday's offering at the Grand
will be "The Mark of Cain," with
Dorothy Phillips and Lon Chaney in

dramatic climaxes.

VITAL STATISTICS IMPORTANT.
Reasons Why Accurate Record of

The Louisiana State Board of
Health points out the following rea

of youth may be protected.
6. That prosecutions dealing with
"age of consent" may be settled by
record and not by conjecture.
7. That litigation in mattters of in

knowledge of the ages of all persons
concerned.
8. That the AImerican-born chil
dren of foreign-born parents may
have indisputable evidence of Amer
ican birth which will protect them
from enforced military service when
visiting the mother country of the
parents.
9. That blindness may be prevent

the infected eyes of the new-born.
10. That infection and mortality
among women may be prevented and
that young babies may be saved by
immediate attention by existing
agencies for the relief of the poor.
11. That the children's bureau of
the United States government may
become effective and may carry out
the duties imposed upon it by con
gress.
12. That the millions of dollars,
from public and private sources, ded

SANDERS STANDS THE TEST.
Completely Refutes the Unfounded
Charges of His Opponent.
While the News-Star has no direct
interest in the contest now being
waged in the sixth congressional dis
trict, yet indiictly we, in common
with every citizen of the state, are
interestgl in maintaining the honor
and dignity of those in authority, or
who have been honored by the peo
ple, so long as they merit and deserve
the consideration and esteem of the
people.
Ex-Governor Jared Y. Sanders has
been before the people of this state
for many years; many things have
been charged against him. Lately his
congressional opponent, Mr. Ponder,
has revamped and paraded before a
disgusted public charges *that have'
been den nced as false. Sanders
has stood ery test, and as a result
he has many real friends as any
man in th tate. The men who stand
'Ibehind Sanders know that l has
I been grossly and wrongfully crged,
and that he is innocent of any Wron
doing. Were this not true, he could
not and would not retain the friend
ship of men ivho believe truth and in
tegrity shouTd govern public officials.
1 He has no patronage to bestow, but
fro& every section of the state there
goes up a demand that Sanders be
sent to congress.
We believe the people of the sixth
district could do no more opportune
n or gracious act than to elect him by
an overwhelming majority. His
e friends in the city of Monroe and all
north Louisiana are watching with in
n creasing interest his gallant fight
against the most vindictive and un
n scrupulous assault ever made on any
candidae in that district.--Monroe
