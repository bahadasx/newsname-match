SAN ANTONIO, Texas, Aug. 19.—
All communication, save government
wireless has been lost south of here
and army officials early today were
anxiously awaiting details of the
damage created by the gulf hurri
caae at Brownsville and other army
camps along the lower Rio Grande.
The latest report from General
Parker, commanding at Fort Brown,
stated that tents had been leveled,
the camg flooded and the Illinois,
Iowa and Virginia militia forced to
move into public buildings. He add
ed, however, that the worst of the
storm appeared to have passed. No
loss of life was reported.
Corpus Christi, about 100 miles
north of Brownsville on the gulf, ap
pears to have borne the 'brunt of the
hurricane. The wind had attained a
50 mile gale early last night when
the telephone wires went out of
commission—the last means of com
munication.
Wind of 120 Miles.
A 120 mile wind was forecast
for midnight Small craft, docks, and
bathing pavilions had been wrecked
there and the electric lighting sys
tem had been put out of business.
Lloyds pier, a 1,000 toot structure,
was almost completely demolished in
the first big seas. No casualties
were known.
The city of Corpus Christi is locat

miles from the open gulf and sur
rounded on three sides 'by Corpus
Christi and Nueces bays. On the
other side of the "bay are Mustang
and Padre islands, forming a break

approach from the gulf. One chan

the gulf. Port Aransas and Aransas
Pass are situated on opposite sides
of'the channel.
Communication Is Broken.
It is impossible to estimate damage
done in those two places, as all com
munication was lost early yesterday
afternoon. The steamship Pilot Boy,
with tea of her crew of thirteen,

[By Ed. L. Keen, United Press Staff
Staff Correspondent.]
LONDON, Aug. 19.—British troops
hurled back the German line north of
the Somme last night, in one of the
greatest gains made by the allies
since the opening smadh of the great
offensive.
The Germans were thrown back on
practically every sector of a six
mile front, extending from a point
south of Thiepval to the point where
the British lines link up with the
French near Guillemont.
The greatest British gain was.
scored from the Foureaux wood,
eastward to the junction point with
the French. General Halg an
nounced this afternoon that the
British advanced on a two mile front
in this region, penetrating German
trenches to a depth of from 200 to
600 yards.
The capture of the western out
skirts of the village of Guillemont
and important advances north, north
west and east of the village, leaves
the Germans still clinging to the
ruins of the village in a deep pocket
and in danger of being cut off and
entirely surrounded. The Germans
made determined counter attacks
during the night but were repulsed
except at one point, where they
gained a little ground.
Made at Various Points.
The British advance was made at
various points along a six mile
front, extending tram a point north
west of Ovlllers to the region of
Guillemont. The most decisive gains
were scored between Ovillers and
Thiepval where the onrush of the
British thrust deeply into the Ger
man lines around the salient at
Thiepval. Bast and southeast of the
Mo(juet farm, southeast of Thiepval,
the British advanced 300 yards. Furth
er east several hundred yards of en
emy trenches were captured, the
Foureaux wood and the Bapaume
Albert highway, an advance that
brought British lines closer to the
fortified village of Martinpuich, of
the local German stronghold*. Still
further east the British drove Ger
mans from western outskirts of
Guillemont and pressing on north
northwesit of the town captured hos
tile positions between Delville wood
and Chinchy, capturing also German
positions in the Orchids north of
Longueval.

LOCAL SQUABBLES
Candidate Charles E. Hughes
Lets This be Known in
His Attitude in
California.
IS FOR PREPAREDNESS
Wants the Title "American Citizen"
to be the Proudest Name
Anyone Can
Bear.
[By Parry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
SAN FRANCISCO, Calf., Aug. 19.
—California republicans will have to
settle their own differences in their
own way presidential candidate
Charles B. Hughes does not propose
to recognize the existence of any
friction.
The republican nominee so indi
cated his position today with confer
ences with various state leaders. In
the meantime, a truce was apparent
between the regulars end progres
sives, manifesting itself when a local
photographer arranged to pose the
nominee, National Committeeman
Crocker and Chester H. Rowell, pro
gressive leader together.
The republican candidate it was
said by those with whom be talked,
feels he should not mix in local or
state issues for the reason that he
does not desire to be Involved in
anything except a clear cut issue
with democrats. Governor Hughes
addressed one of the largest gather
ings he has faced during his entire
swing arouhd the circle iu the civio
auditorium here last night.
Fourteen thousand persons, It was
estimated, packed the huge building
to the doors.
Demands Efficiency.
The candidate placed the principal
emphasis during his speech on a de
mand for greater efficiency In govern
ment, higher tone in American life
and leadership and foreign policy that
will command the respect of the
whole world.
He denounced the democratic tariff
policy and asserted that America was
saved from panic by the business
created two years ago by the Euro
pean war, but added that he didn't
believe that even the European war
can save the democratic party.
For preparedness.
Governor Hughes declared strongly
in favor of preparedness and said he
did not believe there is any danger
of militarism in this country, adding:
"The danger is all the otier way."
In discussing preparedness he said:
"The mixing of politics and business
is always bad in government, but mix
ing militarism and preparedness is
the worst thing that coul» boppen.
"We do not want any bluster, he
said in concluding. "We co not want
any braggadocio. We are not aggres
sive, but the name 'American citizen'
ought to be as proud a title as a man
can wear and ought to have the
power of the U. S. government be
hind it everywhere on this earth.

WASHINGTON. Aug. 19.—Prasi-j
dent Wilson today in a formal state*
ment of his proposal for a settlement]
of the difficulty between the railroads]
of the country and the railroad bro-j
therhoods Indicated his intention toj
stand pat on his Insistence that the
eight hour day be granted the work*'
ers.
"This seems to ma a thoroughly!
practical and entirely fair program,1
ha said, "and I think the public has at
right to expect its aoceptance."
"The eight hour day now undoubfc*
edly has the sanction of the Judgment!
of society In Its favor and should bej
adopted as a basis for wages even
where the actual work to be done canj
not be completed wttbln eight hours,*!
the president said.
At the same time the president pro*
posed that the demand for extra, pay!
tor extra time and all other issues fiai
postponed pending Investigation andl
suggested that if necessary he obtainj
authority from congress to appoint &i
body of impartial Investigators to
probe the whole question. This body
he said would report to congres:
though without making any recom
mendatlon.
Ct-i
Want Arbitration.
The statement was Issued Just afte*j
thirty-three railway heads had aa-i
sembled at the white house to give
their reply to the proposition. Presi
dent Holden, of the Chicago, Burling
ton and Quincy told the president tha"
they continued to stand for arbitrt
tion and did not believe it right
ask them to abandon that principle,
He made it plain, however, that th*
full power of attorney to reject
accept the president's plan, lay flnall
with the railway managers commit
tee who are still in the city, but whoj
have not participated in any of th«
conferences with the president since
the railway executives arrived. It iat
expected that before the final crislsj
has been reached the railway mani
ager will be asked to the white housoj
to indicate whether they will accept
or reject the president's plan.
There is strong indication toda^
that rather than reject It and precipi
tate a strike, they will ask for mora
time and further conferences.
The president's intimation that ths^
interstate commerce commission!
might be expected to give a very falq
consideration to rate increases If thej
eight hour day change is made, is one,
of the things the managers will try
to clear up.
Condition Not Principle.
The president closed the confer
ence with a thirty minute address to
the presidents. He said that it was
"a condition, not a principle," which
is at stake in the present negotiations.
It would be unfair and impracticable
to insist upon arbitration when tho
men have repeatedly refused It and
when there is no system or law to
compel it, he added.
