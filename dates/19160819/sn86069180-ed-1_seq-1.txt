CONTEMPT FOR OURNATIONALITY
Mr. and Mr3. Thomas Hughes
Kelly, of New York, and Joseph
Smith, bf Lowell, Mass., who sailed
July 15 for Liverpool with $50,000
of the Irish relief fund to distribute
among the sufferers from the recent
revolution in Ireland, returned
Saturday on the same steamer, hav
ing been refused permission to land
by the British authorities. Mr.
Kelly issued the following statement
Saturday evening: "Messrs. Thomas
Hughes II. Kelly, of New York, and
Joseph Smith, of Lowell, Mass.,
sailed from New York on the
American line steamship Philadel
phia for Liverpool for the purpose
of distributing the Irish relief fund
in Ireland. They were piovlded
with American passports Issued by
the State Department and vised by
the British Consul General in New
York. Before the issue of the pass
ports George Gillespie, of New
York, attorney for Mr. Kelly and
Chairman of the executive Commit
tee of the Irish relief fund, was
placed in possession of brief biog
raphy of Messrs. Kelly and Smith
for the information and guidance of
the State Department, and he had
several telephone interviews with
Mr. Polk, counsellor of the State
Department, and advised him of the
purpose of the visit of Messrs. Kelly
and Smith to Ireland, and their
character and reputation had been
discussed by him with the British
Ambassador In Washington, appar
ently IN A MANNER SATISFAC
TORY TO ALL CONCERNED.
"The party sailed from New York
July 15 and arrived in Liverpool
July 24. The Philadelphia was
berthed in the Canada dock and the
passengers were assembled In the
dining saloon for examination be
fore debarkation, Mr. and Mrs.
Kelly and Mr. Smith were called
after a time by numbers given them
(132, 133, 168) and Invited to a
corner of the dining saloon, where
their passports and papers were de
manded and given over to E. N.
Cooper, aliens officer. -Messrs.
Kelly and Smith were then taken
to their cabins by detectives and
subjected to personal search of the
minutest character; their pockets
emptied, pocketbooks opened, all
papers, cards, letters, note books,
etc., scrutinized and read, and their
arms, legs and body felt, to ascer
tain if anything was concealpd
about their person. It was the sort
of examination that arrested crim
inals are usually subjected to. The
detectives then conducted them to
the dock where their baggage was,
and they were ordered to open it,
and where it was examined in great
detail. The baggage of Mrs. Kelly
was subjected to the same scrutiny
and minute inspection, her private
letters and papers being examined
and read, the whole transaction be
ing singularly lacking in deconcy,
propriety or any consideration for
the feelings or rignts 01 me ex
amined. Wo were then returned to
the dining saloon of the ship, where
we were subjected to an oral ex
amination and much cross-questioning
by Mr. Cooper, aliens' officer,
and Capt. Gunnis, of the King's
Liverpool Regiment, and Major
Money, of the same regiment, in a
fashion that savored of the police
court lawyer and practitioner. There
were several other persons there
who appeared to bo friends of the
examining officials and amused
spectators of our humiliating treat
ment. We were asked why three
persons were appointed to distribute
thp TrlRh relief fund, when CooDer
was of the opinion that a Jess num
ber would be sufficient. Why were
we Interested in the Irish poor
when none existed? What par
ticular class of poor did we pro
pose to help, and how? Who con
stituted the American committee
and how were the funds collected?
Our letters of identification bearing
the names of the committee were
before them at the time. Did the
Irish relief fund originate as a
movement with the American
hierarchy or were they drawn into
It by others?
"Mr. Smith was asked many
questions as to his profession and
eniDloyment, what he was doing
now, what papers he was associated
with now and in the past? Was his
acceptance of the duty of distribut
ing the Irish relief fund merely a
method of getting a free vacation
or was ho along to watch the other
members of the committee and they
him. The tone and method of the
examination all through was dis
tinctly nasty, sneering, insulting
and humiliating. Mr. Kelly was
subjected to much the same line of
impertinence: and his bills, ac
counts, check books, memoranda
and private correspondence were
minutely gone over and letters of
an obviously private character and
Intimate nature were read with
smiles, nods and whispered com
ments and passed back and forth
by Cooper and Gunniss. This sort
of thing went on for two hours or
more, and then the officials reet&d
from their labor. Some tea minute
later we were handed printed forms
filled in pencil and signed by E. M.
Cooper, stntlng that wo were re
fused permission to land under 'in
structions from the Secretary of
State.' They were handed to us by
Cooper.
"Inasmuch as these instructions
had been issued some four days
prior to our arrival in port and
weie In Cooner's nnKspsqlnn twn
days before we reached Liverpool, I
the ordeal wo were subjected to on I
the ship the search of our persons ,
uuu uugsugo and inp uuminaung
examination by the officials was a
deliberate, coldly calculated and
piemedltated Insult and humilia
tion, MADE ALL THE MORE IN
TOLERABLE SINCE IT TOOK
PLACE ON BOARD THE AMERI
CAN SHIP AT WHOSE STERN
THE AMERICAN FLAG WAS FLY
ING. The incident proves tho ex
istence on American soil of an act
ive system of -British espionage,
since the questions In many ways
showed a knowledge gf activities,
harmless under any government,
and entirely proper and lawful un
der ours, that could only have been
gathered and sent to London by
agents and spies anxious to magnify
the Importance and distort the sig
nificance of tho data collected and
to misrepresent and discredit those
who are engaged in work anti
pathetic to some policy temporarily
popular and official in England.
"Refusal to permit us to land p
England and to compel our deten
tion on shipboard was a prear
ranged matter, and our treatment
merely an expression of British offi
cial contempt for our nationality
and of antagonism to our mission
of mercy. Later In the day Mr.
Kelly wished to cable George
Gillespie, of New York, advising
him of our detention, but was re
fused permission to do so by
Cooper, aliens officer, who Is also
the censor in Liverpool. As tho
cablegram could in no manner be
dangerous to the safety of the
realm, It was accepted by us ss
merely another evidence of punitive
intentions toward us. Wo were
held prisoners on the Philadelphia
for eleven days, while she was being
coaled, painted, repaired and placed
In the dry dock, and It was cer
tainly .a real prison for Mrs. , Kelly,
as the ship was overrun by iLlver
pool dock hands and others of v a
pretty rough .Bort. Mr. Washington,
the American Consul, was given
permission to ask us to his home
under conditions, but we did not
care to Impose on his hospitality
and kindness, and wished to accept
no favors from tho British Govern
ment, it being determined that we
could not proceed on the mission
for which wo came. During our
entire stay of eleven days in Liver
pool and our return to the United'
States not a single message or offer
of courtesy came from Capt. Candy,
of the Philadelphia, nor did he
deign to notice us In any way. Captr
Candy Is British, a nominal Ameri
can citizen, but tho atmosphere of
his ship Is distinctively anti-American."
SOUTH AMERICA AROUSED.
News has just reached this coun
try froiu Rosarlo, Argentina, that
the numerous Irish population
throughout South America have
joined with their brethren in the
United States in tho severest con
demnation of the British executions
of the Irish prisoners of war. The
defeat of the home rule plan has
further intensified feeling among
this class of emigrants. Protest
meetings have been held In various
cities and anti-British resolutions
have been passed' without the inter
ference of the Government. The
declaration of ' the Irish Republic
has been read under the monuments
of South American revolutionists
who established republics. The
Irish-Argentines have been foremost
in the agitation for Irish freedom
and the Irish colors were worn in
tho great celebration of the first
centenary of Argentina. A collec
tion is being taken up by the South
American Irish committees for the
relief of tho rebel families and vic
tims in Ireland, and many newspa
pers are advocating the Irish na
tional cause.

MILTON
The Grcot English Poet Drew
Inspiration From Catholic
Church.
Catholic at Heart and Beolizcd
His Indebtedness to Old
Kcllgion.
Catholics Should. Learn to Un
derstand Nobility of Their
Faith.
OBLIGATE ALL SHOULD REALIZE
T ..
In Ills essay on "Eugenie de
Guerln" Matthew Arnold has told I
us of the ennobling and ' Inspira
tional enect or Catholicism upon
the character of tho -individual'
work which that individual per
fotniB. It is true he could not un
derstand the real essence of Cathol
icism, the real final reason for Its
nobility; but he does say that in it
there is "something European, aug
ust and imaginative," while in
Protestantism ho finds to a great
degree "something provincial, mean
and prosaic." He contrasts tho ef
fect which this elevating .influence
of Catholic atmosphere and tradi
tions has upon the life and writings
of Mddlc. de Guerin with the effect
of Protestantism upon an equally
sincere and pious lady of a noa
Cathollc sect. In the acts and ex
pressions of the latter there is not
the vision or senso of beauty or
depth of feeling that the former
always shows.
In a not too sympathetic review
this attribute of Catholicism has
again been dwelt upon by a recent
writer in speaking of the work of
the great English poet, John Mil
ton; tho poet who, he says, "Teu
tonlzed the versl gciolti imported
from Italy." The great source of
Milton's inspiration, so we learn,
was Catholicism. "It -Is this sym
pathy (with Catholicism and the
Medieval) which explains tho pres
ence in 'Paradise Lost' -of an
Anselmlan theory of the Atonement.
It is this sympathy which accounts
for tho strange intermingling of
allegory with the historicity of the
poem; an allegorizing tendency
which Is scarcely inferior to that
of Gregory the Gceat or Gulllaume
de Loris, and which stirred Addison
to utter astonishment."
"It is not necessary," this critic
goes on to say, "to believe with
Msgr. Barnes that ho was a Cath
olic at heart and died in that faith
in order to realize his indebtedness
to the old religion. His grand
father was a Catholic and his
brother became one; and the frag
ments of emotional sympathy still
lived in the determined intellectual
opponent of the Papacy."
Chateaubriand In his "Genius of
Christianity" has cited Milton's
poetic efforts as an example of the
happy effect of Christianity upon
the genius of the world. And now
we know that the essence of this
thought and inspiration came from
that pure form of Christianity, tho
Catholic church. Catholics should
learn to understand the beauty and
nobility of their religion, not alone
in a spiritual sense but from a
natural viewpoint. They should
seek, too, to reveal this beauty
of their church to those who live
about them. It is an obligation
which should not be allowed to
pass. C. B. of C. V.

GOOD MAN GONE.
Sunday night the West End was
saddened by learning of the ideath
of one of Its oldest and most re
spected residents, Albert S. Robert
son, at his residence, 654 South
Thirty-first street. Deceased was
born seventy-two years ago in Har
rison county, but had lived in
Louisville for over half a century,
being engaged in tho contracting
business until his retirement eight
years ago. While a young man he
married Miss Emma J. LIghton,
their union being blessed by tho
following children, all of whom aie
living: Ex-State Senator Samuel L.,
William, Albert, George M., Charles
E., M. J., Richard and Harry E.
Robertson and Mrs. Henry Michael,
Mrs. Alex. Cranna, Mrs. E. Mat
tlngly, of Owensboro, and Misses
Mary and Agnes Robertson. A life
long Democrat, Mr. Robertson was
a pioneer member of the Twelfth
Ward Club and was an earnest
worker for his party. Ho was an
active member and regular attend
ant of Holy Cross church, where
tho funeral was held Wednesday
morning, Rov. Father Brey conduct
ing tho solemn services.
CONGRESS WILL ACT.
Congressman W. S. Bennett, of
New York, says that If President
Wilson doesn't act in regard to
the Great Britain blacklist, Con
gress will, and he is now preparing
a bill to that end. Congressman
Bennett discusses the situation as
follows:
"It is plain that so far as the
South Amorican situation is con
cerned this blacklisting is purely
and simply a trade bludgeon to
prevent the United States merchants
from securing any share of the
South American trade. Great
Britain insists upon retaining allof
tho trade, that done formerly by
Germany as well as her own share.
Now any one who tries to acquire
any share of that trade Is black
listed. I know of a dozen instances,
totally unconnected, either directly
or indirectly, with the European
war, where American firms have
been prevented from trading wnn
South America. American firms
can not secure ships to carry goods
to Argentina or Brazil without the
consent of the British Government.
A firm, straightforward assertion of
the heretofore proudly maintained
right of the American merchant to
trade where and with whom he
pleases mado at this time by the
Federal Government should soon
put a stop to this situation. If it
does not we can secure tho ships
and convoy them by naval vessels
and maintain our commercial rights
at any cost.
TOOK NEEDED REST.

SOME LOCAL POLITICAL GOSSIP
Democrats throughout the coun
try are becoming more and more
pleased with the situation from a
national standpoint, tho catherlnir
laf""th8",Kentucltyv Stato campaign
neauquarters tnis week all return
ing the same reports as those being
made at national headquarters, and
they are to this effect. Wilson's
gain of ground is not so notice
able but the loss by Hughes is be
coming glaring and the Republican
campaign managers are at their
wits' end to stop the drift away
from their candidate, but whllo
they know the cause, yet it is an
other matter to remedy It. It Is
impossible to stop nominee Hughes
from campaigning, yet they realize
that in every speech he has made
thus far the Republican cause has
suffered. Not only to tho Republi
cans has Hughes been a disappoint
ment, but the public at large, that
is the people of all partes or in
dependents expected great things
from the G. O. P. when ho took tho
stump, and to say that they have
suffered a shock is putting it
mildly. Previous to tho Republi
can convention in the role of tho
sphinx Hughes was especially
stiong, tho Democrats hoping
against hope that he would not be
nominated, thinking it would be.
Impossible to defeat him in the
regujar election.
The first blow camo when his
letter of acceptance was read, which
was very tame, consisting prin
cipally of a rehearsal of the Mexican
trouble and in which ho advocated
nothing new or suggested a plaus
ible change of policy with that
country. The Republicans then ex
cused this by saying "Wait until
he gets on the stump." Everyone
waited, but to date Hughes has
been the biggest fizzle as a national
leader in a long stretch of political
history. In tho role of a sphinx
ho was doubly strong, but as in the
case of many just as soon as he
opened his mouth, as the Irishman
would say, he put his foot in it.
His speeches have been tho ad
dresses of a chronic kicker or
grouch, advancing nothing now,
dodging the important Issues, and
are very much of the type of cam
paign speeches that one would ex
pect to hear from a candidate for
Constable or country Magistrate, In
stead of the ringing or Intellectual
addresses of a candidate for the
highest office in the gift of tho na
tion. No wonder the Republicans
are becoming alarmed, as it takes
no great shakes of a political
prophet to see that Hughes Is losing
support at an alarming rate, and
if the Old Guard does not muzzle
him soon the pulmotor will be
needed to levlve interest.
Another cause for worry in the
G. O. P. ranks Is- that the Taft
and Roosevelt factions arc not
working together very har
moniously, Roosevelt and Perkins
trying to eliminate the Old Guard
from the party councils, while Pen
rose, Crane, Barnes and others are
continually asking why Roosevelt
is tolerated. They ay he didn't
bring the Progressives back to the
party and that his action mado the
Bull Moosers sorer at tho Republi
can party than before, Roosevelt
Is Interested in Hughes only to, the
extent of getting a good foothold
back in the party and bring enough
of his close friends in the party to
control the machinery and secure
the nomination in 1920. Then we
will see a repetition of the 1912
convention, only the shoo will beVa.
I the other foot. Roosevelt and his
friends in control of the machinery
will play the same role as played
dj- me Tart men then, riding over
their opponents rough shod. It
would not be surprising to see this
fight crop out in real earnest before
tho coming election, the Old Guard
being ready to knife Hughes lr
Poosevelt Is to Le the power behind
the throne in tho event or Hughes'
election, whllo Teddy will scuttle
tho ship if he is not the dictator.
Despite the effort to sidetrack
next years' political races talk will
not down, "Bob" Hughes now being

his efforts in behalf of tho million
dollar factory fund, while Col. Pat

DR. JOHN IJ. MURPHY.
America and tho world mourns
the death of its most famous sur
geon, Dr. John B. Murphy, of Chi
cago, who expired suddenly last
Friday at Mackinac Island. The
famous surgeon, who recently was
knighted by Pope Benedict for his
researches in surgery, was only
fifty-eight years old. His pioneer
surgery in cases of appendicitis,
later in the treatment of other in
testinal disorders and moro re
cently in tho serum neutralization
of rheumatic and other Joint trou
bles, has made him known all over
tho world. His funeral took place
Tuesday morning, and was one of
the largest seen in Chicago for
years. Leaders of America praised
Dr. Murphy's thoughts and deeds,
and the following expression from
President Woodrow Wilson voices
tho thousands of others received:
"Mrs. John B. Murphy: May I
not express to you and your family
my deepest sympathy in your great
trial in the death of Dr. Murphy?
The medical world loses ono of its
foremost flguies and our country
sustains a real loss. I am sure
that I express tho feeling of tho
whole country when I mourn his
going. Woodrow Wilson."
CATHOLIC KNIGHTS.
The-Central Committee -or- the
Catholic Knights of America had an
enthusiastic meeting7 Friday night,
William Cu3hing occupying tho
chair. A letter from President
Gaudlu to Gen. M. Relchert was
read, telling of the formation of
new branches and giving encouiage
ment to the local Knights. A propo
sition for a consolidation of a num
ber of branches met with much
favor and was referred to tho State
officers. Treasurer Charles Falk
and Secretary Henry Schulten re
ported tho results of the Jasper ex
cursion, the most successful held in
recent years. With tho end of
warm weather much activity is
promised and an earnest effort
will be made to Increase the mem

made and praiso was given Capt.
Oscar Maier for his efforts In behalf
of the Uniform Rank and the Cen

This Convent of the Good Shep
herd was rounded In 1866 by
Mother M. of St. Ignatius Ward, as
a branch house of the Convent of
the Good Shepherd at Eighth and
Madison streets In this city. A
tract of eight acies of land was
purchased, later fivo acres more
were nrnniinwl nrwl n omnii imi..
erected thereon;'and a-little band of -
aisiers were sent to round another
Told of the Good Shepherd, adding
one more to the folds which dot tho
world over, in North, South and
Central America, Europe, Asia, Af
rica, Australia and Oceanica, mak
ing up a goodly band of nearly
10,000 Sisters or the Good Shep
herd, nearly 4,000 in America, and
all united under one head, a
Mother General at the mother houso
at Angers, France, this good mother
having under her care at the pres
ent tlino nearly 60,000 souls In tho
Good Shepherd convents through
out tho world. This order was
founded In 1651 by Blessed John
Eudes, and the first colony came
to America at the earnest solicita
tion of Right Rev. Bishop Flaget,
who over held them in the highest
esteem and greeted the first Sisters
with, "I bless the day of your ar
rival in my diocese." Bishop Flaget
was ever a kind father and did all
In his power to nurture the founda
tion then struggling for an exist
ence. The annals of the order In
Kentucky teem with the record of
acts of more than fatherly kindness
in their regard, The first colony
consisted of five brave young re
ligious, the eldest the Superior,
Mother M. des Anges, being but
twenty-nine years of age, who
braved the dangers of the Atlantic,
and after a three months' voyage
reached their destination Louisville
on December 1, 1842, and founded
the first houso or tho order on
American soil the historic Convent
or the Good Shepherd at Eighth and
Madison streets, this city. Later
Mother M. des Anges was appointed
to found a convent at Philadelphia,
nnd nffpr It wns woll natnhllnViori
was recalled to Louisville as Mother
Provincial, and died while holding
that office at the convent at Twenty-third
and Bank streets. At her
death our lato Bishop, Right Rev.
William J. McCloskey, who knew
full well the saintly qualities of
this admirable mother, remarked
that "Wo should not pray for her,
but to her."
The llttlo mustard seed sown at
Twenty-third and Bank streets has
grown until it has developed Into
an Immense block of eight sub
stantial', spacious buildings (and
even then not enough of room for
all who apply for admission), with
beautirully laid out park-like
grounds, which afford a safe and
comfortable home for nearly four
hundred persons, divided Into three
departments, ono for dependent
children rescued from unfavorable
environments, or orphans, this de
partment under patronage of St.
