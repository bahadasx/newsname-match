foot by foot.
The announcement says:
"North of tho Somme the enemy
during the night delivered several vio
lent counter attacks against the posi
tions taken by us yesterday and on
the ceding days from the region north
of Maurepas to Clery. All of tho
enemy's attempts wore broken down
by our machine gun fire and the en
ergetic counter offensive of our gren
adiers and were unsuccessful except
at one point whore the enemy gained
a footing In a small piece of trench

Bamberger For Governor;
W. H. King For Senator
Simon Bamberger Nominated for Governor.
Important things icame to pass in j
yesterday's Democratic state conven
tion important because they indicate
that a new era is beginning in Utah
politics. This is the expression of the
unbiased opinion of those summariz
ing the results today as follows:
First in nominating a "Gentile" to
head the ticket, the convention abro
gated the "unwritten law," which
has played so Important a part in
political campaigns of the past; sec
ond, it declared against racial, and
religious prejudico and called for the
selection of candidates on tho basis
of American citizenship; and, third,
in fusing with the Progressives, the
assembly appeared to be (consolidating
tho opposition to the Republican
' forces in the state.
While some viewed tho placing ot
Progressives on tho ticket as a
political move that aimed for party
success at tho polls in November, it
was slated that tho action In no way
could be considered as a surrender of
principle embodied In the meaning of
Democracy, as It had been agreed that
the presidential electors, whether
Progressives or Democrats, would sup
port President Woodrow Wilson in
"his r.anmaien for re-olection anl would
work for the success of the state and
senatorial ticket at tho coming elec
tion. The subject of the "unwritten law"
and the effect of its operation in Utah
politics was brought up in tho ad
dress of B. H. Roberts, who placed
Simon Bamberger in nomination for
governor. That his remarks wero
given unequivocal endorsement was
shown later when Mr. Bamberger was
made tho nominee. Frequently in
terrupted by prolonged applause en
gendered by his remarks, Mr. Roberts
vehmently denounced the methods
that had been employed In Utah poli
tical campaigns of the past. His dar
ing speech held the attention of tho
assemblage for a longer period than
any of the other speakers were al
lowed. In 'the course of his address, Mr.
Roberts set forth how Mr. BaiWbergcr,
born In Europe, had come to America
and to real freedom as a lad; how ho
had dedicated his. life to the United
States and to Utah, where, by his
own efforts, ho had risen from ob
scurity to eminence as a builder and
business man. Continuing, he said;
"This candidate has had objection
ade to him becauso of race, religion
and nationality. The native son's ad
vantage is merely one of accident. I
am proud to stand here and rebuke
those who would, in a political con
vention, raise the objection of race
and religion of any man. When our
ancestors, my friends of Anglo-Saxon
antecedents, were back in early Eu
rope drinking vodka or its equivalent
from the skulls of their enemies, the
ancestors of my candidate were in
Syria and Palestine contributing to
literature, the arts and commerce the
finest there was and what endures
even to this day. If ever a man had
reason to be proud of racial origin,
it is the Jew.
"We have a condition here in Utah
that we must get rid of. We have
thought that we must name candi
dates becauso they are Mormons or
non-Mormons, instead of on the basis
as American citizens. That is not
right, and I would that nly candidate
might lead in smashing the 'unwritten
law' in Utah Simon Bamberger, who
belongs to the people of Utah and all
the people."
Acceptance.
Mr. Bamberger was nominated on
the second ballot and his speech of
acceptance was hold as the expres
sion of a man of broad-gaugo. In a
ceedlng a logical sequence, he des
cribed his feeling that resulted from
the honor bestowed upon him, avowed
his intention to work for party suc
cess in the campaign and to stand
squarely on the platform adopted by
tho convention.
"I am much affected by this hon
or," Mr. Bamberger said huskily. "And
I want to say that I hope and trust
that you will never have occasion to
i egret nominating me for this exalted
place. This is tho most intelligent
convention I have ever attended. You
have democtratcd it." Referring to
Mr. Robert's nominating speech, Mr,
Damberger said: "I 'did not tell Mr.
Roberts what to say and when ho
made his address I thought I was in
a dream. Needless to say I am hero
to raako the race for the party, and
not for Simon Bamberger alone.
We'll go on to victory. I feel so sure
of it that if we lose I'll walk back to
tho Wyoming line, where I came Into
Utah years ago."
It was 9 o'clock before the nomi
nation for governor had been made.
A great deal of tho time of tho con
vention had been consumed by the
committee on platform and resolu
tions, in whicli a fight was precipltat-

Dramatic Incident.
A dramatic incident occurred after
tho reading of the voluminous re
port of tho committee by the chair
man, C. C. Richards, and when James
H. Moyle, of Salt Lake, moved that
the provision excoriating Governor
William Spry for his action in vetoing
the Wootton bill passed by the last
legislature, be stricken out, Mr. Moyle
held that to strike a man when he
is down is not in accord with Demo
cratic principles. A. N. Durham, a
delegate from Beaver county, receiv
ing recognition from the chair, stated
that as a member of the committee it
was his remembrance that the com
mittee had amended the report so as
to remove the provision. A. J. Weber,
chairman of the convention, called for
a vote on the question. There were
only a few votes against striking out.
The platform adopted declared for
slate and national prohibition and
pledged the candidates to enact a
prohibition measure, that would be
come effective August 1, 1917.
Tho principal interest of the con
vention was centered in the guberna
torial contest. There were three can
didates besides Mr. Bamberger Ar
thur W. McCurie, Joseph F. Merrill
and Stephen L. Richards. The ballot
ing for governor was as follows:
First ballot Bamberger, 272 H-12;
, Richards, 14 G 2-3; McCune, 101 1-12;
Merrill, S2 1-3.
Second ballot Bamberger, 401 1-16;
Richards, 134 2-3; Merrill, 9 1-3; Mc
Cune, 50 1-3.
Because Piute and Kane counties
were not represented at tho conven
tion, the total apportionment by
counties of 625 was reduced to 607
delegates, 304 votes being necessary
for choice.
Message From Wilson.
A telegram from President Wood
row Wilson, In response to a message
sent by a loading Utah Democrat, was
read to the convention. It proved tho
occasion for a demonstration. The
telegram was as follows:
"Your letter received. May I
not think you for tho generous
assurance which you give me in
tho namo of the Democrats of

extend my cordial greetings to all

Right to Know What Is Being Done and

Washington, Aug 1 9. President Wilson has made pub
lie his statement to the railroad managers, declaring for an
eight-hour day.
In his address to the officials, President Wilson said:
"If a strike comes the public will know where the respon
sibility rests. It will not be on me."
.
President Wilson sent the following telegram to fourteen I
presidents of western railroads : I
"Discussion of the matters involved in the threatened
railway is still continuing. It is highly important that I should
personally confer with you or some one authorized to repre
sent you 'at the earli3t possible moment. Hope you can ar
range matters so as to be able to come to Washington at once."
Washington, Aug. 19. While the
railroad presidents were in confer
ence with President Wilson today,
the president gave out a statement ,
outlininng his plan of settlement, and
saying:
"It seems to me a thoroughly prac
tical and entirely fair program and
I think the public has the right to
expect its acceptance."
While President Wilson was con
ferring with the executives he made
public a statement outlining his plan.
President Wilson's statement follows:
. "I., have recommended the conces
sion of the eight hour day that is
tho substitution of an eight-hour day
for the present ten-hour day in all
the existing practices and agreements.
I made this recommendation because
I believe the concession right. The
eight-hour day now undoubtedly has
the sanction of the judgment of so
ciety in its favor and should be
adopted as a basis for wages even
where the actual work to be done can
not be completed within eight hours.
"Concerning the adjustments wmch
should be mado In justice to the rail
roads and their stockholders. In th5
payments and privileges to which
their men are now entitled (if such
adjustments are necessary) there is a
wide divergence of opinion.
Eight-Hour Day Roads.
"The railroads which have already
adopted the eight-hour day do not
seem to be at any serious disadvan
tage in respect to their cost of opera
tion as compared with the railroads
that have retained the ten-hour day,
and calculations as to the cost of the
change, must. If made now, bo made
without regard to any possible admin
istrative economies or readjustments.
"Only experience can make It cer
tain what rearrangements would be
fair and equitable either on behalf of
the men, or on behalf of the railroads.
That experience would bo a definite
guide to the Interstate Commerce
Commission, for example, in determin
T 11.. nknnfin
lng as a conaequuuue ui -iii3 v.iniiifc,
if it would be necessary and right
to authorize an Increase of rates for
the handling and carrlago of freight
(for passenger service is not af
fected.) Men to Postpone Extra Pay.
"I, therefore, proposed that the de
mand for extra pay for overtime made
by the men and the contingent pro
posals of the railroad authorities be
postponed until facts shall have taken
the place of calculations and fore
cast with regard to the effects of a
change to the eight-hour day; that, in
tho meantime, whilo experience was
developing the facts, I should seek
and, If need be, obtain authority from
congress to appoint a small body of
impartial men to observe and thor
oughly acquaint themselves with tho
results, with a view to reporting to
congress at the earliest possible time
tho facts disclosod by their Inquiries
but without recommendation of any
kind; and, that it should then be en
tirely open to either or both parties
to the present controversy to give no
tice of a termination of tho present
agreements with a view to Instituting
Inquiry into said re-adjustments of
pay or practice.
"This soems to bo a thoroughly
practical and entirely fair program,
and I think that the publlo has the
right to expect Its acceptance."
Negotiations Not Closed.
All the railroad presidents said the
question was not closed and that the
negotiations would bo continued.
President Holdon of the Burlington,
spokesman for the officials, said no
time had been sot for them to boo
President Wilson again, but that it
waB necessary to confer with the com
mittee of managers which has the au
thority to accept or reject plana.
Several of the executives indicated
disappointment over President Wil
son's statement but showed particu
larly interest in his mention of the
Interstate Commerce Commission con
sidering an increase in freight rates.
Roads Face a Condition.
In his talk to the executives today
President Wilson told them wero fac
ing a condition, not a principle. He
asked why they should demand arbi-
t rat ion when there was no law for
compulsory arbitration law through
congress. The employes, he recalled,
had consistently refused arbitration jH
and he believed it was impossible to
gain it In the present controversy.
"I have been asked to sit as a
judge," said the president in sub
stance. "I cannot do that, I simply
can suggest a plan, a way in which
I believe this question can be set
tied fairly to all concerned.
President Urges Road to Accept
President Wilson urged again that jH
tho railroads accept the plan, adopt jH
tho eight-hour day at least temporar
ily and then allowed the proposed J
commission to fully investigate tho
facts. He pointed out that the rail
roads brought forward one set of state
ments and the; employes another and
it was impossible for him to tell which
was correct.
In conclusion President Wilson said
he believed his plan was the only
eauitable wav of settling the controv-
ersy and that under It both sides
would be treated fairly.
Mr. Holden gave the president esti-
mates of the cost of the eight-hour day
to the railroads. President Wilson
in reply urged that the railroad offi
cials, with the committee of managers,
very carefully consider his plan before
giving any final answer. That was
agreed to by the railroad executives. jH
Brotherhood Men Accept.
It was learned definitely that in
their acceptance of President Wil- jH
son's plan the employes made no res
ervation. One of the railroad presidents said
after the conference that he did not !H
consider the situation hopoless, but
that it was very serious. President
Wilson, he said, had asked for a
"show down," and that the railroad
officials would give a final answer as
soon as possible.
The belief was current in adminls
tration circles that tho railroads would 'H
make some concessions. H
After the conference President Wil- 'jH
son telegraphed to a number of presl- jH
dents of western roads inviting them jH
to come to Washington.
Would Avoid Disaster.
President Wilson declared he was
the spokesman for 100,000,000 people,
every one of whom had a deep inter-
est in the present situation. His only
object, he said, was to avoid a strike,
with its consequent disaster to the IH
As the president spoke to the offi
cials he paced up and down beforo
them in the Blue Room. Several
times ho emphasized points with a
clenched fist. He Bpoke solemnly
and often paused and faced thorn as
he asked that they accept his plan.
The railroad officials were equally
colemn and Mr. Holden told tho pres
ident they realized the serioUsneBB of
the situation.
"We must face the naked truth la
this criBis," said tho president. "Wo
must not discuss impractical things. IH
We must get down to a basis on
which this situation can be solved."
