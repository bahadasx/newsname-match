PUN UP TO
PRESIDENTS
Railroad Heads Called to
Washington to Avert Gen
" eral Strike.
IS READY TO GO HIGHER
Indications Point to Support
of Managers' Refusal by
Presidents, Says Report.
Washington, Aug. 18. President
Wilson has laid his plan for averting
the threatened railway strike before
the employes' committee of 640.
Having found the managers' commit
tee adamant to his proposal that they
accept the.8-hour day he appealed to
the railroad presidents and asked
them to come to the white house for
a conference.
There is every indication that if the
railroad presidents sustain their man
agers, President Wilson will appeal
finally to the financial powers which
control the roads, for it is his purpose
to deal with the ultimate authority be
fore he gives up his efforts. The
president's plan which is expected to
be. formally accepted by the employes'
committee at a meeting at 9 o'clock
tomorrow morning proposes:
An 8-hour day as the basis for com
puting wages.
Regular pay at the 8-hour day rate
for overtime.
To refer all other collateral issues
to a small commission to be created
by congress on which the employes,
the railroads and thepublic would be
represented.
Acceptance of the proposal by the
employes was forecasted by expres
sions of their leaders after they left
the president's conference.' One of
them declared: "The men would be
fools not to accept it."
The attitude of the railroad presi
dents is not so clear.

A
Defeated The Purpose of
Young Man Bent on
Suicide.
ANTIDOTES USED IN TIME
Ellis West, Bridegroom of
Three Months, Says He
Wants To Die. ' 1
Ellis West, acred 23, attempted to
commit suicide yesterday at 12:30 p.
m.. at the home of his mother, Mrs
Nannie West, on Twenty-First street,
but failed in the opinion of the attend
ing physician, because the poison
with which he attempted to poison
himself was made up of strychnine,
rough-on-rats and carbolic acid, and
failed to kill him because the poisons
neutralized the mixture and one
counteracted the effect of another.
Mr. West had been married to Miss
Linnie Hayes only three months ago,
When a doctor came to administer
medicine he said, "I want to die, "I
have nothing to live for." But later
submitted to treatment and took the
antidotes given him and did as direct
ed by the physician.
Mr. West had worked at the Mogul
Wagon Works for a number of years.
Several weeks aco, it is said, a dis
pute between him and another work
man at the wagon factory had result
ed in his resigning his place there.
Yesterday just before he took the
mixture of poisons, his sister heard
him fire two shots from the back
yard. It is not known what caused
him to fire the shots.
SUESHUSBAND
F0OIV0RCE
Mrs. Anna Meyers Asks For
Legal Separation From
Charlie Meyers.
Mrs. Anna Myers yesterday filed
suit for divorce from her husband,
Charles Meyers, a local meat dealer.
The plaintiff says they were married
in Nashville, Tenn., July 0, 1910, and
have lived here as man and wife until
this month when she was forced to
leave the defendant on account of his
cruel and inhuman conduct, which
has been crowing worse for six
months, until she was forced to leave,
him. She also alleges that the de
fendant neglected her and left her
alone at night, although she made
him a faithful and dutiful wife and
helped him to run his business. She
prays for divorce and costs and an
allowance for attorney's fee.

THRUSTS PERIL
GERMANCENTER
Russians Now in Position t
Flank Middle Portion of
The Teutonic Front
SLAVS EAGER TO ATTACK
"Have Enough Ammunition
to Take Us to Berlin,"
Declares Russian Officer.
The continued success of General
Brussiloff's two powerful movements:
which are gradually enveloping Kovel
and Lemberg, have begun to havo
marked effect on the situation in the
central portion of the front whiclu ex
cept small Russian gains in the fake
region of Dvinsk, has remained vir
turlly unaltered since the Russians
fell back last autumn to the line front
Dvinsk to the Pinsk marshes. Tho
Austrian line now has receded so far
before the repeated thrusts of ffit
southwestern Russian forces in south
ern Poland and Galician that the Ger
mans are in great danger of flankimr
movements from the south and tha
automatic retirement of the forces op
posed to Russian center.
A corps commander who showed
the correspondent of the Associated
Press a huge supply of ammunition
and material at the disposal of one
part of the force engaged in this sec
tion of the front, said: "We have?
enough ammunition stored away to
take us to Berlin."
The soldiers seem to be plentifully
supplied with wholesome food and
are living under the best sanitary c on
ditions. They are surrounded by
comforts and conveniences compara
ble to those at a modern African
summer camp. The spirit and light
ing strength of the Russian soldier
appear to be very high and troops
confidently expect to occupy their
original quarters in western Potand.
For the first time in weeks no
change of importance was reported in
any theater of the war Thursday. The-
most violent fighting took place on
the western end of the British salient
on the Snmme. Six times the Ger
mans advanced in force in a desper
ate effort to bend back the British
lin s northwest of Pozieres. London-
reports that all of these assaults were
repulsed with heavy losses and that
the British in turn captured about 10O'
yards of trenches northwest of Ba
zentin. TUBERCULOSIS
