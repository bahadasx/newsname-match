Official Proceedings of the Police Jury p
of Grant Parish.
Colfax, La., Aug. 11, 1916. s
The police jury met pursuant a
to adjournment. All the mem
bers were present. The minutes
of the proceedings of July 5 were
read and approved. And the
minutes of July 25 were also read t
and approved. a
A letter was read from Mrs.
Mollie M. Christie, in which she
stated her reasons for objecting d
to the proposed public road lead- t
ing from the Colfax-Montgomery s
model road at spur number two
to the Lemoine ferry on Red riv- t
er. Mr. Lemoine was present
and addressed the police jury fa
voring the establishment of the c
road. In the course of the dis
cussion it was stated that Mr. C.
O. Sharp was in favor of making
an outlet to the river, but that
he was opposed to the establish
ment of a public road there. Mr.
Calhoun reported that he went to
the place where it is desired to
locate the proposed road. He
found the lands there fenced and t
no passage way there for teams
or wagons.
On motion the following reso
lution was adopted:
Resolved by the police jury of
Grant parish. That in order to
provide a wagon way from the
Colfax-Montgomery model road
at or near spur number two, to
the Red river at Lemoine's ferry,
in direction and place about the
same as the direction and place
of the boundary line between the
of Mrs. Mollie M. Christie
and t Mr. C. O. Sharp, it
is the order o e police jury
that the owners of theland men
tioned, namely Mrs. Christie and
Mr. Sharp, shall construct or
cause to be constructed two gates,
one oh the river side and the oth
er on the back side of the lands
(which are fenced and enclosed),
each gate to be located at or near
the boundary line mentioned and
opening to a wagon way upon
and across the said land on or
near said boundary line, the said
gates to be of dimensions suitable
for the passage of wagons and
teams and kept in such condi
tion as to be conveniently opened
and closed at all times.
The hour of noon having arriv
ed the police jury ordered a re
cess until one o'clock p. m., at
which time the following process
verbal of the election in ward
number four, held August 9,
1916, was prepared, read and
signed:
PROCESS VERBAL.
Be it known and remembered
that on this the 11th day of Au
gust, 1916, at 12 o'clock m., in
accordance with an ordinance of
the police jury of Grant parish,
adopted July 3, 1916, notice of
which was issued and published
according to law, the undersign
ed members of the police jury of
Grant parish, being a quorum
thereof met in public session at
the court house in said parish,
and according to law opened all
the ballot boxes used in and
which were received from the
commissioners of the election
held on the 9th day of August,
1916, in accordance with said or
dinance, and there proceeded to
count the ballots both in number
and amount for and against, to
determine the proposition to levy
a five mills tax on all the proper
ty in ward number four of Grant
parish, for a period of five years,
beginning with the year 1916 and
ending with the year 1920, for
the purpose of building and main
taining public roads in said ward
number four of said parish.
The result of said count was 44
ballots and twelve thousand sev
en hundred and forty-four dollars
($12,744.00) in favor of the said
proposition, and 14 ballots and w
six thousand four hundred and pc
fifty-four dollars ($6,454.00) pt
against said proposition; and the b<
majority both in number and pi
amount cast by the property tax qi(
payers of said ward number four s"
in the said election being in favor pi
thereof; and at the same time ft
and place we did examine and
canvass the returns as evidenced
by the duplicate tally sheets and tk
duplicate compiled statements, b4
the correctness of both being ai
sworn to by the commissioners b:
according to law, and finding also ol
that said returns indicated a ma- pi
jority both in number and amount p
of property in favor of said prop
osition; n
Therefore we declared that the o
result of said election is in favor
of the proposition to levy a five
mills tax on all the property in it
ward number four of Grant par- P
ish for a period of five years, be- 1'
ginning with the year 1916 and n
ending with the year 1920, for 0
the purpose of building and main- n
taining public roads in said ward c
number four of said parish.
And in accordance with law, a t,
promulgation of the aforesaid re- n
sult was prepared and the secre- fi
tary of the police jury was or- it
dered to have a copy of the same p
signed by the president and pub- b
lished in one issue of the official a
journal. f
And likewise we did order that n
one copy of this process verbal v
be sent to the Secretary of State F
to be recorded in the archives of a
the State of Louisiana, that one I
copy be sent to the recorder of a
mortgages to be recorded in the r

This done and signed in the

house at Colfax, in the parish of i
