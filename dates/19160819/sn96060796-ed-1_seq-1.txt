ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
October 19 to 21 are the dates
set lor the Northern Arizona
Pair, which is held in Prescott
every fall just preeeeding the
Arizona State Pair at Phoenix.
Prank C. Whisman has been
elected president of the North
ern Arizona Fair association.
High grade gold ore assaying
over $500 a ton has been str'ick
at a depth of thirty feet on the
property of the Oatman Empire
mine. The company has over
100 tons of good milling ore on
the dump, and will at once begin
drifting at a depth of sixty feet.
The Arizona Taxpayers Mag
azine is authority for the state
ment that the total valuations
of mines and mining property in
the State of Arizona for the
present year is $212,301, 020.58.
approximately one half of the
total value of all property within
the state.
Pelts of two mountain lion?,
one of which measured nine feet
from tip to tip have been brought
to Prescott by J. R. Patterson
of L. D. Thompson valley. It is
estimated that the two lions did
hundreds of dollars worth of
damage to livestock before they
were killed.
Globe may shortly become the
export center of a valuable com
modity. An expert is in the
city for the purpose of making
an analysis on certain guano de
posits within the radius of a
few miles of the city. The re
sult of his investigations as to
quantity and quality will be
made known shortly.
Receipts from National For
est for the fiscal year 1916
reached the high water mark of
approximately $2,820,000, ac
cording to figures just compiled.
This is $311,000 above the 1915
total, which in turn exceeded
any previous year. Officials say
that the gain was due to increas
ed demand for all classes of
forest products.
Salt river valley farmers south
of the river are shouting for re
lief from a pest of game and are
welcoming sportmen. White
wings and Sonora doves are
swarming south of Phoenix,
while on the farms below Mesa,
bordering on the plain, the rab
bits, jack and cottontail, are a
serious problem, hopping in to
feed on alfalfa and grape vines.
To attend the conference of
s'tate engineers with the secre
tary of agriculture relative to
the expenditure of the federal
appropriation for highway con
struction, State Engineer Lamar
Cobb of Arizona is on his way
to Washington. The appropria
tion carried by the Bankhead
bill gives Arizona $68,000 fed
eral money to extend on high
way construction next year.
Survey and estimate of the
proposed direct route from Pres
cott to Jerome has been ordered
by the Yavapai county board of
supervisors following the filing
of petitions by business men and
property owners of both cities.
The new road, which reduces the
distance between Prescott and
Jerome to thirty miles, will cost.
it is estimated, about $00,000.
The present route is over sixty-
five miles.
A tree six feet through at the
stump and containing nine huge
saw logs was recently cut on the
Coconino National Forest of Ari
zona, according to a report re
ceived from the Forest Super
visor at Flagstaff. Five of the
logs were decayed, but neverthe
less, the tree contained over
9,000 board feet of sound lumber,
enough to build a good size
house. The age of the giant
was 400 years.
Eighty trainloads of cattle and
sheep will be this season's out
put from the Salt River valley
ever the Southern Pacific rail
road alone. Thirteen trainloads
of sheep averaging twenty-five
cars have been shipped from
Phoenix to Kansas City and at
least two more trainloads will be
shipped during the season. Six
ty four trainloads of beef cattle
have been shipped from Phoenix
to Los Angeles.
It is said that 15,000 fish will
be placed in the waters of Sa
hino Canyon near Tucson, in
September or October.
With a balance of but $17.11,
! the general fund of the state of
! Arizona is the lowest in history.
I The depletion of the general
fnnd it is said is due largely to
I the extra expense caused by the
1 mobilization of the National
Guard at the time of the Clifton
str ike and also to the amount of
money loaned by the state to the
various counties for the con
struction of bridges. The coun
ties are required to pay the
loans back in installments.
The old Benson smelter which
has been idle for years is to be
prepared and put into operation
according to a representative of
the American Smelting & Refin
ing company which will operate
the plant. Benson's new can
ning factory which has a capa
city of 2500 dozen cans per day
is now in operation handling the
tomato crop. The factory em
ploj s fifty. Tomatoes, beans,
peas and pumpkins will be
handled by the new concern.
Thousands of white wing doves
are devasting the fields of wheat,
milo maize, feterita and other
grains in the Salt River valley.
Scores of farmers are appealing
to hunters to come to their farms
and slaughter the birds, paying
them good wages in addition to
allowing the privilege of hunt
ing. The damage to the grain
fields, it is estimated will amount
into the thousands of dollars.
Many hunters are entirely dis
regarding the limit fixed by law
and are killing the birds by the
wholesale.
In 1915 there were 2,455,66
automobiles registered in the
United States and their owners
paid a total of $18, ,245,713 in
licences. Most of this money
was used in road funds. There
is an average pf one car for
every 41 persons in the United
States. Iowa leads with one
car for every 16 persons. Ala
bama is lowest with one car for
every 200 persons. New York
leads with 255,242 registrations,
Illinois is second with 180,832,
California third with 173,797 and
Pennsylvania fourth with 160,
137. Arizona has 10,300 cars.
Three million eight hundred
thousand pounds of copper were
turned out by the Old Dominion
and International smelters dur
ing the month of July. Ship
ments to the International smelt
ers includes ores from the Unit
ed Verde Extension mine at
Jerome, the Arizona Commer
cial mining company as well as
numerous small shippers. The
output of the Old Dominion
smelter for the month was three
million pounds. All records for
mining at the Inspirational were
broken during July when four
hundred and eighty five thous
and tons of ore were mined and
treated.
It is said that the cotton pick
ers of the Salt River valley are
organizing and will demand 3
cents per pound for picking cot
ton instead of 2 cents. The cot
ton growers' association will
fight this, and it remains to be
seen what the outcome will be.
Pickers will be scarce at best,
but growers can ill afford to pay
much over the customary rate
of 2 cents per pound, especially
in average years. To raise the
price per pound this season
would be to establish a preced
ent which would be difficult to
overcome in years when the
price is less than it promises to
be this year.
If the cattlemen ever had a
good season On the range in the
last few years, this is the season,
for while we have not had much
rainfall excepting in a few spots
where cloud bursts have occurr
ed, it is a fact that we have had
over thirty days of showers,
drizzles and best of all more
cloudy days than for years, and
that has served to make the
grass fairly jump on the ranges.
The rain has not been sufficient
to help the springs to any ap
preciable extent, but there have
been innumerable water holes
stocked and that has made plen
ty of water available for the
cattle. Tombstone Prospector.
SHOW DAY IS COMING.
When the show comes to
town," is what the people are
saying now, and the show that
they mean is the Cole Bros.' Big
World Toured Shows and Train
ed Wild Animal Exhibition, which
is bigger and greater than ever
this season, as the Cole Bros,
are now offering their new, big,
giant, three-fold show combined
in one. This colossal organiza
tion will exhibit here on Wed
nesday, August 23rd.
This mammoth amusement en
terprise, with its myriad of high
class performers and train loads
of the most valuable beasts of
the jungle, offers the cleanest,
grandest and most instructive
entertainment ever presented
here. Every thing imaginable in
the way of trained animals, do
mestic and wild, is given, from
the smallest monkey to the
largest elephant. No show on
earth exhibits finer specimens of
high school and high jumping
horses. An interesting perform
ance by Shetland ponies appeals
to the children.
Among the hundred arenic
acts are astonishingly clever ac
complished acrobatic exploits,
equilibristic feats of strength,
asts of deftness and dexterity,
difficult ladder balancing acts;
also an innovation in the way
of a novel dancing exhibit, par
ticipated in by perfectly formed
young women. The Nymphs of
the Statues, the act beautiful,
has aroused unprecedented en
thusiasm. The Cole Bros, have left noth
ing undone in their efforts to
present the finest show in the
world. The mile-long parade,
starting at 10 a. m. tells the
story. Nothing finer has ever
been shown than this glittering
pageant of unsurpassed grand
eur; the shining coats of blooded
horses, the gilded chariots, the
satin robes of the riders. This
is the show to wyhich you may
take your wife, your mother or
your sweetheart; this is the
show that gives what it adver
tises; the show that pleases.

'DECOY AND RETRIEVER."
After all, it seems that Col
onel Roosevelt merely delivered
the hide of the Bull Moose to
the Republican bosses. Bain
bridge Colby, who nominated
the colonel at the late lamented
Progressive convention in Chi
cago, is the latest leader of that
party to announce himself in
favor of the reelection of Pre
sident Wilson. He has gone
even farther. He declared that
the opposition to Mr. Wilson's
reelection "proceeds from an
un regenerated Republicanism,"
of which Charles E. Hughes is a
"decoy and retriever." He says
even more. He asserts that if
Mr. Hughes were elected "the
old guard would rope him and
tie him, as they did when he
was governor in Albany, reduc
ing him to plaintive futility."

PRESIDENT'S EUROPEAN POLICY
The complete story of Presi
dent Wilson's European olicy
remains to be written, but
its high achievements already
are fully appreciated by the
people of the United States.
No more successful policy,
whether of peace or war, was
ever evolved by an American
president to meet the exigencies
of a crisis in American interna
tional relations. The president
succeeded absolutely in meeting
the paramount need which his
European policy was evolved to
meet. That need was for the
abatement of the German policy
of making submarine attacks
against merchant ships without
going through the process of
visit and search.
Suppose another man had been
president of the the United
States when Germany's policy
of f rightfulness endangered the
peace between the two gov- .
ernments. Suppose he iiad been
a man of martial spirit, instead
of one possessed of that keen
understanding and sympathy for
American ideals with which
Woodrow Wilson is imbued.
What would have been his main
objective as he formulated his
policy for dealing with Germany?
Suppose even that he had gone
to war, would he not have done
this with the main purpose of
Drocuring an abatement of the
outrages which Germany had
committed, and thus insuring
for the future that respect for
American rights which would
enable our citizens to travel
wherever they willed upon the
high seas safely and without
fear of their rights being violat
ed. A war or some other policy
might or might not have suc
ceeded in bringing this about.
The policy which the president
has followed did succeed. His
vigorous exertion of the moral
power of America upon the in
tellects and hearts of the German
rulers and the German people,
and his clearly indicated purpose
to break with Germany if she
did not respect our rights com
pelled the most militant of na
tions to bow to America's will.
This was the supreme diplomatic
achievement of modern times.
Undoubtedly the future histori
an, in writing of the European
war, will comment upon the pre
sident's achievement as remark-,
able and epoch-making. Miner.
Can Voters Re-Reigister.
Attorna L. B. Whitney has
filed a mandamas suit in the Su
perior Court at Tombstone for
James A. Chapman against
County Recorder Owen E Mur
phy to compel the latter to can
cel Chapman's registration and
to allow him to register. This
is a friendly suit brought to de
termine a perplexing question.
The petition states that on
May 6th Chapman registered
without giving any party affilia
tion, but now desires to be re
garded as a Democrat and vote
as such in the comjng primaries.
It is expected that Judge Lock
wood will render a decision with
in the next few days.
This question has come up all
over the state, and most of the
County Recorders have stood
pat and refused to make any
changes, but in a few counties
the recorders have interpreted
the law to the effect that a man
can re-register and thus change
his party affiliations. Benson

A Swede was being examined
in a case in a Minnesota town
where the defendant was accus
ed of breaking a plate-glass
window with a large stone. He
was pressed to tell how big the
stone was, but he could not ex
plain. "Was it as big as my fist,"
asked the judge, who had taken
oyer the examination from the
lawyers in the hope of getting
some results.
"It bane bigger," the Swede
replied.
"Was it as big as my two fists."
"It bane bigger."
"Was it as big as my head?"
"It bane about as long, but not
so thick," replied the Swede,
amid the laughter of all but the
Judge. Pittsburg Chronicle-Telegraph.
