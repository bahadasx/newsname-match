San Antonio. Aug. 19. With army
t wireless reports received up to a late
hour last night, stating there had
been comparatively little damage and
no known loss of life in the Browns
ville district, chief anxiety centered
early today on the situation at Corpus
Christi and vicinity as a result of the
tropical storm which struck the Texas
gTilf coast yesterday. The only loss
of life so far reported was in the
sinking in the Gulf of Mexico of the
mail steamer Pilot Boy plying be
tween Galveston and Corpus Christi.
The vessel carried a crew of 13, only
three of whom have as yet been re
ported saved. These three were wash
ed ashore alive at Port Aransas,
Texas.
The last telegraph wire into Corpus
Christi failed at 2:30 o'clock yester
day afternoon and the last telephone
went out shortly before 7 o'clock last
night. Reports from Corpus Christi
placed the velocty of the wind at 70
miles an hour.
Play Havoc in Camps.
The storm played havoc among
army camps in the Brownsville dis
trict, practically half of the tents hav
ing been blown down by the storm,
and loss of considerable army equip
ment was reported. Fully 30,000 na
tional guardsmen and regular soldiers,
it was stated, were sleeping in public
buildings in Brownsville last night.
Guardsmen principally affected were
from Illinois, Iowa and Virginia. Their
camps were either destroyed by the
wind or flooded with water from a
four and one-half inch rain.
Kast reports from Corpus Christi
stated that the storm had carried al
most everything movable before it,
leaving in its wake dozens of demol
ished summer cottages and thousands !
of dollars of damage in the business I
section. Many small craft in Corpus
Christi bay were thrown high on the
beach.
Many Towns Isolated.
Other important places isolated by
! the hurricane included Kingsville,
Hinton, Beeville, Harlingen, and Alice.
The roof of a hotel was blown off and
a moving picture theatre destroyed at
Port O'Connor, but the inhabitants had
ample warning and had reached
places of safety before the storm
struck there.
The maximum velocty of the wind at
Galveston was 4 0 miles an hour and
the tide rose four feet there.
Governor Dunne of Illinois, who has
been inspecting the Illinois guards
men's camp in the Brownsville dis
trict, left Brownsville for his home,
and is apparently marooned on his
train somewhere between Brownsville
and Houston. His train left Browns
ville yesterday afternoon and so far
as known has not been heard from
since.

President Holds Railroad
Executives to Blame if
Break Occurs.
PARLEYS NOT ENDED
Will Continue Negotiations
Fate of Arbitration
Plan Unknown.
Washington, Anp. 19. After an
hour's conference with President
Wilson today the 33 railroad pres
idents left the White house with
out giving any indication that
they had abandoned their stand
for arbitration hut with assur
ances that the negotiations were
not end ?d.
The railroad executives gave no
final answer to the president's
proposals but will deliberate on
them today and see President Wil
son again probably Monday.
In his address to the officials Presi
dent Wilson said:
"If a strike comes the public will
know where the responsibility rests.
It will not be upon me."
While President Wilson was con
ferring with the executives he made
public a statement outlining his plan
and declaring it seemed to him a
"thoroughly practical and entirely
fair program and I think the public
has a right to expect its acceptance."
One ray of hope that it might in
duce the railroads managers to
make concessions stood out in a sug
gestion that the interstate commerce
commission might determine whether
it would be right to increase freight
rates to meet the added compensation
to employes.
President's Statement.
The president's statement follows:
""I have recommended the concession
of the eight-hour day that is, the
substitution of an eight-hour day for
tha present 10-hour day in all the
existinypractices and agreements. I
made this recommendation because I
believe the concession right. The
eight-hour day now undoubtedly has
the sanction of the judgment of so
ciety in its favor and should be adop
ted as a basis for wages even where
the actual work to be done cannot be
completed within eight hours.
"Concerning the adjustments which
should be made, in justice to the rail
roads and their stockholders, in the
payments and privileges to which their
men are now entitled (if such adjust
ments are necessary), there is a wide
divergence of opinion.
Fight Honrs ot a Disadvantage.
"The railroads which have adopted
the eight-hour day do not seem to be
at any serious disadvantage in respect
to their cost of operations as compar
ed with the railroads that have retain
ed the 10-hour day, and calculations as
to the cost of the change must, if made
now, be made without regard to any
possible administrative economics or
readjustments. Only erperience can
make it certain what rearrangements
would be fair and equitable either on
behalf of the men or behalf of the
railroads. That experience would be a
definite guide to the interstate com
merce commission, for example, in
determining whether, as a conse
quence of the change, it would be nec
essary and right to authorize an in
crease of rates for the handling and
carriage of freight (for passenger ser
vice is not affected).
Would Postpone Other Demands.
"I, therefore, proposed that the de
mand for extra pay for overtime made
by the men and the contingent pro
posals of the railroad authorities, be
postponed until facts shall have taken
the place of calculations and forecast
with regard to the effects of a change
to the eight-hour day; that, in the
meantime, while experience was devel
oping the facts, I should seek, and if
need be, obtain authority from con
gress to appoint a small body of im
partial men to observe and thorough
ly acquaint themselves with the re
sults, with a view to reporting to con
gress at the earliest possible time the
facts disclosed by their inquiries, but
without recommendation of any kind;
and that it should then be entirely
open to either or both parties to the
present controversy to give notice of
a termination of the present agree

attack on the Somme front which was
made yesterday but that between
Guillemont and Maurepas the Ger
mans shortened their line somewhat.
London, Aug. 19. The British line
on the Somme front has been advanced

Wood to the junction point with the
French forces, the war office an

Paris, Aug. 19. The remainder of

the French won their way forward
foot by foot.
German counter attacks were made
repeatedly on the Somme front. The
statement says the Germans were re

50 prisoners in the hands of the
French.
Sub Lieutenant George Guynemer
of the French flying corps, who has
earned a reputation for daring, is

SUB VICTIM
Stampalia Is Torpedoed" by
Enemy Undersea Craft
on Way to U. S.
LIFE LOSS NOT KNOWN
With a Passenger Capacity
of 1,700 and Crew of 170
List May Be Large j
London, Aug. 19, (12:13
a. m.) The Italian steam
ship Stampalia, which plies
between New York and
Italian ports, has been
sunk, says a dispatch to
Lloyds.
On Way to Xew Tort.
The Stampalia was a passenger liner
of 9,000 tons gross. In common with,
other Italian liners she mounted guna
for protection from submarines. The
last report of her movements was her
arrival on July 30 at Genoa from New
York. She apparently was sunk on
the return voyage to the United States.
She was commanded by Captain Lava
rello. The Stampalia has accommodations
for about 1,700 passengers. On her re
cent voyages from Italy to New York
passenger traffic has beon light and
New York agents of the line said to
day she probably carried a compara
tively small number of passengers.,
Her crew numbered about 170.
Carried Gnns for Defense.
The Stampalia first appeared in Nevir
York as an armed steamer in Febru
ary last, arriving from Genoa with,
two 3-inch rapid fire gnns mounted on
her after deck house. Washington was.
notified and on being informed that
the guns were to be used for defensivo
purposes only, instructed the collector
of the port of New York to grant clear
ance papers.
On arriving at New York March 24
the Stampalia reported a wireless
warning had been received soon after
leaving Genoa that a submarine was
lying in wait for her off Sardinia. In
stead of going north of Sardinia and
along the north shore of the Mediter
ranean, which before that time had
proved the safest route, she went south
of Sardinia and through the straits of
Bonifacio, between Sardinia and Cor
sica. Several armed Italian steamships re
ported sighting submarines in the Med
iterranean and in some instances be
ing pursued by them and firing on
them. Italian naval gunners were de
tailed to service on armed passenger
vessels to operate the guns.
Ship Pursued by Subs.
When the Italian steamship Re D
Italia arrived in New York Aug. 6
from Genoa her captain reported she
had fired on three submarines in the
Mediterranean. The steamship was
pursued for seven hours.
There has been some Increase re
cently in submarine activity. The
naval expert of the Paris Temps wrote
on Thursday that the German subma
rine campaign against merchant ships
was again in full swing, in accordance
with the German note to the United
States in February In which It was
claimed merchant ships carrying guns
could not be considered as peaceful
ships.
The Stampalia was 476 feet long and
55 feet of beam. She was built at
Spezia in 1909 and was owned at
Genoa.
In (.Government Service!
The New York agents for the
Stampalia said today that two weeks
ago they had received a cable mes
sage advising them that all sailings
of the steamship had been cancelled.
They express the opinion that the
Stampalia had been requisitioned and
was in the service of the Italian gov
ernment. In this case she would have
no passengers on board.
NEWS AGENCY RAPS
.MARQUIS OF CREWE
Berlin, Aug. 19. When the Marquis
of Crewe made his recent statement in
the British house of lords regarding al
leged violation of the German govern
ment's pledge to the American govern,
ment regarding the sinking of vessel
by German submarines without warn
ing he had no evidence bac k of hit
words, declares, the semi-official Over,

States and Germany and to influence
Amorican public opinion for the fur
therance of British designs.
"The Xorni in whic h the Marquis of
Crewe made his statement La charac
teristic," says the news agency, "lie
did not assert, but 'inslnuatw', which
proves that no evidence was back of
his words. The suggestion that the
