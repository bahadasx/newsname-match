Speech Delivered
By Coy. Sanders
at Baton Rouge
August 8th.
A Former Governor Jared Y. Sanders
answered the various charges that
have been made against him by his
opponent, Amos L. Ponder, and out
lined his views on national issues
Tuesday night in his speech at Baton
Rouge. The meeting was held in
the Elks Theatre, but the 'building
was too small to hold all who want
ed to hear the ex-Governor and many
had to be turned away.
The meeting was presided over by
District Judge H. F. Brunot, who
after stating that the parish of East
Baton Rouge wes practically a unit
on behalf of the candidacy of Mr.
Sanders, called upon Mr. Wade H.
Bynum to introduce ovy. Sanders,
to whom Judge Brunot referred as
"the next Congressman from the
Sixth District."
Mr. Bynam in his introductory re
marks eulogized the former Govern
or both as a public man and as a

to the services which Mr. Sanders
has rendered to the State.
