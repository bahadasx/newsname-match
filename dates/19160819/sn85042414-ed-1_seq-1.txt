STRIKE~SITUATION
ON RANGE IS QUIET
Virginia, Minn., Aug. 19.—Beyond
much interest shown in the outrages
in Biwablk Thursday night and near
Hlbblng, when two homes were dyna
mited, and some abortive picketing at
Biwablk yesterday there was. nothing
big in strike circles today on the iron
range. There is an almost absence of
picketing here.
It develops in the case of Mattl
Moilans. arrested in connection with,
the Biwablk explosion and now here
In Jail, that a warrant was issued for
his arrest July 1 for -making threats
against those whose homes were dyna

WOMEN OF LONDON
SEE HOPE OF VOTE
London, Ang- 19.—The present
week brought within the range of
practical politics a reform, which
many of its advocates feared the war
would postpone perhaps for a genera
tion—the right of women to vote.
The strongest force against the reali
sation of woman suffrage In the years
Immediately preceding the war was
the determinated opposition of Pre
mier Asqulth. Great surprise was
caused by his virtual conversion when
he said in the House of Commons on
Monday that the undertaking of new
franchise and registration forms in
the midst of a great war was too com
plex and controversial a problem and
when he implied that any new bill for
franchise reforms In the future must,
of necessity, Include women.
The premier's announcement is
talked of on all sides as meaning that
women will have the vote before an
other general election Is fought, ex
cept In the unlikely event of an elec
tion being forced on the country be
fore the war ends.

PROGRESS MADE
IN PLAGUE WORK
Anticipate Early Announce
ment Anent Medical Treat
ment of Infant Disease.
New York, Aug. 19.—Important
discoveries concerning infantile pa
ralysis, by surgeons of the United
States public health service, expected
to revolutionize medical knowledge of
the disease, probably will be an
nounced soon, it was learned here last
night.
Surprising progress has' been made
at the government laboratories and
by government research and field
Workers, it was said, but before an
announcement is made of the cause
of the disease or a specific for it, the
physicians propose to be in a posi
tion where no doubt can be thrown
on their conclusions.
Health Commissioner Emerson said
last night that nine out of eleven
monkeys had been inoculated success
fully by government pathologists and
that some of the mysteries of the dis
ease hitherto puzzling to medical sci
ence had been solved.
The -results in Washington have
been so encouraging that the city bu
reau of laboratories here has issued
an appeal to the public for all kinds
of pet animals afflicted recently with
paralysis, to be used for experimental
purposes.
The idea is to find some animal, it
was explained, having a type of pa
ralysis that may provide useful study
In obtaining Information about an
terior poliomyelitis.
For the first time since the epi
demic of infantile paralysis in this
city reached proportions to alarm the
health authorities, the advisory com
mittee of the board of health an
nounced with confidence that the dis
ease had begun to wane. This conclu
sion was based on comparative figures
of deaths and cases in previous weeks.
For the six days ending today it
was shown there had been 778 cases,
an average of about ISO a day, while
the week previous the average was
more than 164 a day. In the week
ending August 6 the cases averaged
158 a day.
The deaths this week, it was point
ed out, average less than 82 a day,
whereas last week they were 48 a day.
Official denial of the report that the
epidemic of infantile paralysis had
originated in the Republic of San Sal
vador, was made today to the health
authorities in this city by President
Carlos Melendez, through Manne Pe
ralla, In charge of the consulate here.
President Melendez's cablegram read:
"Empower you to issue denial. Not
a single case has happened here."
CHICKEN SELLERS
ADDED ONE POUND
New York, Aug. 19.—A pepper-fed
chicken, If kept thirsty long enough,
will drink a pound of water, and
poultry dealers are bringing to this
city chickens with thirsts excited In
this manner and allowing wiem to
drink just before they sell them. This
la what Joseph Hartigan, commis
sioner of weights and measures, an
nounced he had discovered.
The scheme of Increasing a chick
en's weight is a substitute, he said,
for the old device of feeding them
gravel, used by dishonest dealers and
abandoned After an exposure. The
commissioner said he was gathering
evidence on which to base arrests.

A reply from Nicaragua to Salva

BRITISH REPLY
NEARLY READY
To Answer U. S. Complaint
of Censorship—Lord
Cecil Explains It.
London, Aug. 19.—The British re
ply to the American inquiry in regard
to the operation of the censorship in
transit of American news cabled from
Germany by way of London will be
sent to Washington in the course of a
few days. Discussing this subject
Lord Robert Cecil, war trade minis
ter, said:
"Considerable misapprehension evi
dently exists in regard to our censor
ship of transit matter- There iB no
question that such a censorship on
our wires and cables is necessary as
long as Germany continues in abso
lute control of all information from
that country. If Germany should
abandon the censorship we would not
interfere with dispatches from un
biased American correspondents.
"Another reason we now censor
much matter is the fact that Ger
many circulates in other countries
dispatches sent to American newspa
pers as the comment of those papers."
Several weeks ago a group of
American correspondents in Berlin
asked Ambassador Gerard to inquire
If the American government could ob
tain for the American press facilities
for the forwarding of press dispatches
from Germany unhampered by the
British censorship. The state depart
ment, on receiving this inquiry, for
warded It to London without com
ment. Ambassador Gerard was quot
ed as saying he could not endorse the
attitude of the correspondents unless
the German government removed the
censorship on Amerioan dispatches.

RAiROAD PttfSIDDdS GIVE NO
PRESIDENT WIISON OUTLINES WAN
SAVS PUBLIC MAS RIGHT TO EXPECT
TIE ADOPTION OF EIGHT-HOUR DAY
Washington, Aug. 19.—President Wilson's statement follows:
"I have recommended the concession of an eight-hour day that Is
a substitution of the eight-hour day for the present ten-hour day, in
all existing practices and agreements. I have made this recommenda
tion because I believe the concession right. The eight-hour day now
undoubtedly has the sanction of the judgment of society in its favor
and should be adopted as a basis for wages, even where the actual
work to be done cannot be completed within eight hours.
"Concerning the adjustments which should be made, the injustice
to railroads and their stockholders in the payments and
which their men are not entitled (if such adjustments are necessary)
there is a wide divergence of opinion.
"The railroads which have already adopted the eight-hoar day do
not seem to be at any serious disadvantage in respect of their cost of
operation, as compared with the railroads that have retained the ten
hour day. And the calculations as to the cost of change must, if
made now, be made without regard to any possible administrative
economies of readjustments.
"Only experience can make it certain what rearrangements would
he fair and equitable, either on behalf of the men or on behalf of the
railroads that experience would be a definite guide to the Interstate
Commerce Commission, for example. In determining whether as conse
quence of the change, it would be necessary and right to authorize an
Increase of rates for the handling and carriage of freight. (For passen
ger service Is not affected). I, therefore, proposed that the demand for
extra pay for overtime made by the men and contingent proposals of
the railroad authorities be postponed until the facts shall have taken
the place of calculations and the forecast with regard to the effects of
the change to an eight-hour day.
"That, in meantime, while experience was developing facts. I
should seek and, if need be, obtain authority from congress to appoint
a small body of impartial men to observe and thoroughly acquaint
themselves with Hie result, with a view to reporting to congress at the
earliest possible time the facts disclosed by their inquiries, hut without

CRISIS NOT TO

SEVERAL DAYS
Having Accepted Proposals,
They Are Marking
Time Today.
Washington, Aug. IB.—After an
hour's conference with President Wil
son, 33 railroad presidents left the
White House today without giving
any indication that they had aband
oned their stand for arbitration, but
with assurances that the negotiations
had not ended.
They gave no answer to Wilson's
proposals, but will deliberate on them
today and see Wilson again, probably
Monday.
While the conference was in prog*
ress, Wilson gave out a statement,
outlining his plan of settlement He
said of it
"It seems to me a thoroughly prac
tical and an entirely fair program and
I think the public has the right to
expect its acceptance."

Each side apparently is working to
organize public sentiment in its fa
vor.
Will Know Who to Blame.
In his address to the officials, Wil
son said
"If a strike comes, the president
will know where the responsibility
rests. It will not be npon me."
Railroad presidents, now number
ing 33, went to the White House con
ference without the managers' com
mittee, contrary to a previous an
nouncement.
They still held the view that they
only were authorized to speak for
their own roads and not vested with
authority to speak for all lines, which
the managers' committee has.
Are Unyielding.
The majority of the presidents are
said to be in an unyielding attitude,
although not all favored holding out
against Wilson's proposition.
In his statement, Wilson said he
recommended the substitution of an
8-hour day for the present 10-hour
day. because he believed it right.
He declared that the railroads
which already had adopted an 8-hour
day did not seem at a disadvantage,
respecting the cost of operation.
One ray of hope that it is believed
might induce the railroad managers
to make concessions,' stood out In the
suggestion that the interstate com
merce commission might determine
whether it would be right to Increase
freight rates to meet the added com
pensation to employes.
The railroad presidents indicated
that they will make a statement soon.
All said the negotiations will be con
tinued.
Railroad Heads Disappointed.
President Holden of the Burlington
road, spokesman for the officials, said
that no time had been set for them
to see Wilson again, but it was neces
sary to confer with the committee of
managers, which has authority to ac
cept or reject.
Several executives Indicated disap
pointment over Wilson's statement,
but showed particular interest in his
mention of the possibility of the In
terstate commerce commission con
sidering an increase in freight rates.
Wilson told the presidents that he
believed his plan the only equitable
way of settling the controversy, and
that under the plan both sides woald
be treated fairly.
Wires Western President*.
President Wilson wired the presi
dents of fourteen western railroads:
"Discussion of the threatened strike
is continuing. It is highly important
that I personally confer with you at
the earliest possible moment. I hope
you can arrange matters to come to
