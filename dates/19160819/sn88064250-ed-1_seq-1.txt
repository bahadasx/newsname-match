IBilaire Carriere Shot by Sheriff

TAKEN TO HOSPISLL
AT, LAKE CHARLES
Desperado in Serious Condition, and
Information Is that He Has Poor
Chance to Recover
Just one month ago Sheriff
M. L. Swords of St. Landry
Parish was assassinated by
Hilaire Carriere in 'that see
tion of the Mallet-wood known
as "Pot Cove."
On Tuesday of this week
Assessor D. M. Fontenot was
elected to fill the unexpired
term of the vacancy created
by the death of Marion L.
Swords.
On Thursday morning at two
o'clock Sheriff Reid of Calea
sieu shot and probably mor
tally wounded the desperado
Carriere. Carriere was' fired
on three times with buck
shot, and pach shot took
effect.
The career of Hilhire Carriere,
--ade notorious by the assassina
-tion of Sheriff Marion L. Swords,
shas come to an end. That career
ias one of the blackest in the crim
i.i'al annals of this State. The shot
, from the gun" of Hilaire Carriere
lbrought to the grave one of the best
~known, greatest loved and highest
r7espected officials in the State of
Louisiana. Marion Swords was one
(of #ie leading political figures in
tyh is State.
Many reports contcadicting each
other flowed into The Clarion of
tiee, coming from all sections, from
t'his and surrounding parishes. The
.Clarion anxious to kiye its, usual.
. ect report got in touch with tlbe
eidiJor of The American-Press of the
iYty of Lake Charles, a'd below we
'.pnint the story in fulltas told by
r. Krebs :
Sheriff Reid got information a
#fewdays ago that Carriere was hid
iiig at the old Putnam Saw Mill,
Ut a mile west. of Ben Field in
tn*eline parish, and about six
:itls :orth of Elton, Jeff Davis
h• The officers knew that

IRE CONFESSES TO :
NT OiFFENSES
Ihure Carriere madW a coiP0S
sion of the several murders com
mitted by him. He confessed that
he had killed the old negro at Jen
nings, but that this deed was done
in self-defense. He also acknowl
edged that he had killed a young
negro boy. He killed this boy, he
said, because '.he (the boy) had
promised to give him up for the
sum of twenty-five dollars. Car
riere admits that he killed Sheriff
Marion L. Swords, but says that he
is sorry for it-that he has regretted
it since. He told the questioners
that ,he had almost killed another
man, meaning Mr. Chachere-that
he .thought that he had hit him.
Carriere also said that he was sorry
that he had not killed the two ne
groes who had reported to the St.
Landry authorities. Sheriff Reid
says that he hated to kill Carriere-
that he did not want to do so. Said
that he wanted to capture him alive,
but that Carriere's former acts did
not warrant taking any chances.
SEARCHING PARTY
WORKS HARD.
The different searching parties
have certainly worked hard during
the hunt for Carriere, especially
can this be said of Sheriffs Reid of
Calcasieu, Latiolais of Lafayette,
Fontenot of Acadia, the sheriff of
Cameron and Acting Sheriff R. M.
Littell of St. Landry. They were on
the go almost continuously.. Many
clues were brought to thei which
proved to be futile. Only Wednes
day was a correct information re
garding Carriere's whereabouts
given. Several times before- they
were on his trail, but on each occa
sion they were unable to locate the
desperado.
MUCH EXCITEMENT
Opelousas is in a high pitch of
excitement. Never since the killing
of the Sheriff have the people been
so anxious *bout this matter. There
is a speculative comment afloat
that if Carriere is brought to Ope
lousas that he will be met by an uh
ruly mob. To this statement little
credence i tta0caied. Leaving aside
speculation Op eousas. people are
anxiously a aiti, to know whether
Carriere will fover from the
wounds revived They all want to
see this Carrie e-this desperado
who killed their popular sheriff.

ON DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE,
All Join Hands to Make Election of
' Darius Fontenot Practically Unan
imous on Sept. 12th.
Charles Thibodeaux has a4Ways
been regarded as a game loser; he
once more showed that he was able
to stand the "gaff" and that he was
ready to congratulate his victorious
opponent. On Wednesday morning,
bright and early, Charles Thibo
deaux wa's one- of tihe first men to
appear up-town and as soon as
young Darius Fontenot, successful
candidate for the democratic nomii
nation for sheriff, a'rrived at the
courthouse, Mr. Thibodeaux ex
tended the glad hand, congratulated
his opponent and tendered his sup
pdrt to him, in the event that he
should have opposition at the polls
on September 12th.
J. W. Bassett, is said to be a can
didate on the Bull Moose ticket,
most people posted with Louisiana
politics claim that Mr. Bassett will
not be able to have his name ap
pear on the ticket. This did not
bother Mr. Thibodeaux, ISowever, as
he was ready at all times to sup
port the nominee: In fact if it is
necessary for him 'to go out cam
paigning -for the man who defeated
him, at the :polls on last Tuesday
Mr. Thibodeaux is ready to do so..
- The recent campaign was one of
the most hotly, contested ever held
in St. Landry parish. There was
considgrable bitterness engendered
on both sides, but after the cloud of
battle blew off and the, victor was
found to be Mr. Fontenot the lead
ing fighters and bitterest political
enemies of the successful candi
date did not hesitate to step for
ward and extend their congratula
tions and support at the general
election.
Both Mr. Fontenot -and .-Mr.
Thibodeaux feel grateful to their'
loyal supporters throughout the
parish, and th'ey have already in
various forms expressed their
thanks to their friends, who as
sisted them in the recent campaign.
In speaking to a representative of
the Clarion Mr. Thibodeaux said:
"I want to express my heartfelt
thanks to those who voted for me
in the late primary. I want to
say that I appreciate their loyal
support. I am going to vote for and,
support the nominee of te demo
eratic party.

Plaquemine-Mallet Distrit Tax
Payers Are Said to FavO Tax
and Proposition M4y arry
The property taxpayers /of the
Mallet-Plaquemine drainage district
will be given another opportunity
to express their opinion on the
question of most vital imporcance to
the landowners of the Mal t and
Plaquemine Point neighbor'hhods, in
the shape of a tax election.
It is understood that the police
jury at its next meeting will ap
proye the new boundaries of the
old district and it is claimed that
the election will' be called within
the next few weeks. It is said the
najority of the landowners are in
favor of the propositibn, as a- large
portion of the cotton and corn crops
in the district was lost during the
present year on account of defec
tive' drainage.
J. Franklin Schell has been work
ing in the district with the view of
acquainting every taxpayer of t'le
proposition, and it is= said that
there is not a taxpayer in the dis
trict who does not know exactly the
situation.
Mr. Schell was asked .by the
largest landowners of the' district
to take the lead in boosting up the
cause, and this gentleman did not
hesitate to work for the cause as
hard as thlough he was a taxpayer
of the district himself.
Surveyors have been out, in the
district for the poest two weekstid

ALL INTEREST TURNS
TO IUDIGIAL FIilHT
Candidates Lewis and Sandoz Have
Met With Success in Evangeline
YOUNG ATTORNEYS ASSURED
OF FLATTERING SUPPORT
The People of the Sixteenth Judi
ei'l District Have' Gotten Behind
Candilacies of Lewis and Sandoz
,o JobhW.: Lewis and s-epton R. L
Sandoz have made a triumphant
tour of the beautiful Evangeline
country and have returned to St.
Landry with assurances of a great
victory at the polls. The two young
Opelousas attorneys who are oppos
ing Judge B. H. Pavy and District
Attorney R. Lee Garland will sweep
Evangeline parish on the 12th of
September like a cyclone and will
romp home with a great victory.
While the recent contest for'sher
iff kept the attention of the voters
of St. Landry, more interest being.,
manifested in that. election because
of the fact that it was pulled off a
a month before the judicial elec
tion, Mr. Lewis and Sandoz were in
Evangeline making a tour of that
parish and renewing old acquaint
ences. All reports from St. Lan
dry's daughter are to the effect that
the ecent visit of the "Peoples
Candidates" has proven a source of
great satisfaction to the voters and
gratification to the candidates, as
the voters of Evangeline were given
an opportunity to discuss issues in
a "ieart-to-heart" manner with the
candidates.
The "Peoples Candidates" are now
busy in St. Landry, which is claimed
by he "ins" by an overwhelming ma
jority, and the, result which .will
astound the most optimistic sup
porters of the. Pavy.-Garland fac
tion. If the result of the judicial
contest is to rest s·lely with the
St. Landry vote the many friends of
Messrs. Lewis and Sandoz feel con
fident that on the 12th of Septem
ber a new day will dawn for the
young and ambitious youths of the
sixteenti judicial district, as Lewis
and Sandoz will surely be elected
district attorney and judge respec
tively.
SVoters throughout the district,
personally- friendly to the present
incumbents, feel ghat. zioom should
be made .forother worthy sons of
the district; no man should have a
monopgly of an 'office, 'especially
`when there are others, younger,
more vigorous and progressive, to
take theiv places. That will be one
of the -reasons why Lewis and san
dos willibe elected by such decis
ive majorities on: September 12th.
HYMAN-HILLER GIN WILL
USE ELECTRIC MOTORS
Stelly & Barnett inatall Modern
Machineries In Their Up-To
Date Plant in This Ctly
The Hyman-Hiller gin, which is
now owned by Simon Stelly and J.
P. Barnett, and which will be oper
ated by Mr. Stelly, is the .first gin
plant in this parish to ilstall elec
trict motors and' to discard the
steam engines and boilers. Mr.
Stelly, popular manager of the con
cern, being a progressive sort of a
fellow readily undertook to prove
that it was more, economical to
operate a-plant of that sort by elec
tricity than by steam.
The motors are being installed and
Ahould be ready for operation to
day.. From henceforth the Stelly
Barnett gin will be able to operate
every day ip the cotton season, as
the cost per bale ,will always re
main the same whether there is
only one or whether there is a
hundred.
Those who are interested in mod
