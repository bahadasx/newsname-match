Planned Italian Catholics to Take St. Mary's.
Special to
xtartfora, Aug. 19. As a
Roman Catholic diocese of Hartford, announced yesterday by
Bishop John J. Nilan it has become known that Bridgeport is
the seat of one of the largest growths that the church has ever
sustained in Connecticut.
With the announcement yesterday that Rev. Michael F.
Keating had been assigned to the Church of the Holy Rosary,
Bridgeport, leaving St. Thomas' Seminary in this city for the
purpose of becoming administrator of the Italian church in
Bridgeport, knowledge of at least two proposed new parishes
and the enlarged scope of foreign Work in that section neces
sitating the re-parishing of the entire East Side became a topic
of ecclesiastical conversation. '' '
Though actual confirmation of the seemingly well defined
plans for Bridgeport are not announced at the Episcopal Resi
dence of Bishop Nilan in Hartford it is asserted by those in close
touch with Diocesan affairs that the next two years will.witness
a marvelous growth in the church properties at Bridgeport.
As projected at this time what are
known as 3t Mary and St. Charles'
parishes are to be turned into three
parishes, probably to be known as St.
Paul's, the Immaculate 'Conception

ever, another storm was reported ap
proaching from an easterly direction.
The storm played havoc among the
army camps. Fully 30,000 national
guardsmen and regular soldiers were
asleep in buildings at Brownsville last
night it was . stated, because their
camps were destroyed by the. wind or
flooded with water from a four and
one-half Inch rain.
Last ' reports from Corpus .Christi
stated the storm had carried almost
everything before it leaving in its
wake dozens of demolished summer
cottages and doing thousands of dol

by the hurricane Included Kingsville,
Sinton, Beeville, Harlingen and Alice.

EVERY WORKER
BENEFITED BY
LABOR UNIONS
Secretary Wilson Declares
Organization Has Done
, Much For Shopmen.
FUTUEE BRIGHT, HE
SAYS, FOR AMERICA
Boom Isn't Dependent Upon
European War Orders, He
Tells Farmer.
"Every ' worker has been benefited
by organized labor, for the better
working conditions procured by organ
ized labor are reflected; in the condi
tions of every worker, be he a mem
ber of the union or not" .
This view was expressed to a Far
mer reporter today by W. B. Wilson,
secretary of the department of labor
In the cabinet . of President Woodrow
Wilson. Secretary Wilson, who is the
first official of organized labor to be
selected for a cabinet position in the
United States, said today:
, "We are at the dawn of a great and
prosperous industrial era In the United
States. It is difficult to determine
Just how much our trade has been in
creased by the warin Europe and in
estimating this we do not want to
overlook the fact that we are a great
consuming country.
"We have procured many new mar
kets and we will create others. We
will go forward, not backward. As
for the munitions trade created by the
was abroad I should say that even if
the war were to -end tomorrow there
would be no falling" off in this busi
ness for we must keep on manufac
turing for ourselves in order to attain
the state of preparedness which most
of us are now agreed is necessary.
The munitions business at the best is
only a very small percentage of our
trade abroad.
"During the last century the work
ers have made great progress, and
through organization great benefits
both to employers and' employes have
become realities.' As the world pro
gresses so the future must grow
brighter for all of, us."
Secretary Wilson said he was not
familiar - enough with ' the suits
brought by Bridgeport manufacturers
against individual members of the In
ternational Holders union here. He
said: - .
"I understand it is somewhat simi
lar to the suit of Loewe & Co. against;
the Hatters of North America except
that the legal points involved are en
tirely different In the Loewe case,
boycott was the charge. In the case
of the Bridgeport Holders I under
stand the manufacturers have brought
Up th old charge of conspiracy."
Secr-ftary Wilson would not discuss
the case any further, although later
In the afternoon he touched upon the
matter in a general way when he nar
rated, the struggle of organized labor
against findings of judges that picket
ing of factories and soliciting workers
to strike came within the penalties of
the Conspiracy Act
Regarding the railroad situation
and the demands of railroad workers
Secretary Wilson said that President
Wilson is- now engaged in handling
this matter and he would make no
comment
In the stadium at Pleasure Beach
this afternoon he made a speech
which' was listened to with the closest
attention , by the thousands of union
machinists and their friends in other
crafts who had gathered Cor the field
day. '
Secretary Wilson's address was a
most . interesting account of the
achievements of organized labor in
this country. He told first briefly of
the struggle of union men for the
right to organize and how . they had
finally attained it He then describ
ed the various means invoked by capitalists-
to disrupt the labor organiza
tions.
The invocation of the1 old conspiracy
laws against labor organizations who
picketed factories and solicited work
ers to quit during strikes and the
struggle of the union men for the
right to do this and their final suc
cess under the law were all graphical
ly pictured by the secretary.
He described in an interesting man
ner, enlivening some rather dry data,
as he( related .the . struggle by the
unions to curb the abuse of injunc
tions in labor troubles and then nar
rated what has been accomplished in
this respect
Free from all the tricks of the pro
fessional orator. Secretary Wilson has
a style all his own and he painted a
thrilling and realistic word picture
of the century long struggle for rec
ognition and better things, which the
workers of this country have made.
In passing. Secretary Wilson
sketched the work of the department
of labor, its creation, what it has ac
complished and what it hopes to ac-
(Continued on Page 2.)
SECRETARY WILSON'S
OPTIMISTIC WORDS
"Every worker has been benefit
ed by organized labor, for the bet
ter working conditions secured by
organized labor are reflected in the
condition of every laborer, be be a
member of the union or not"
"Wo are in the dawn of an era
of Industrial prosperity. The" war
in Europe has not created this."
"We have secured new markets
for our products and will create
others."
'The munition business is but a
small percentage of the great in
dustrial work being carried on here.
If the war stops in Europe and the
munition markets fail us there, we
must go on manufacturing here in
order to attain the condition of
preparedness which all now seem
agreed as necessary."
"The past century marks a won
derful advancement for the work
incrman. The future will be brighter."

REPORT LOSS
OF ITALIAN
OCEAN LINER
Stampalia Sunk While in
Service of Government
Used to Ply Between New
York and Italian Ports'
Kecently 'Gave" Up Pas
senger Service.
London, Aug. 19 The Ital
ian steamship Stampalia, which
plies between New York and
Italian ports, has been sunk,
says a despatch to Lloyds.
The Stampalia was a passenger
liner of 9,000 tons gross. In common
with other Italian liners she mounted
guns, for protection from submarines.
The last report of her movements. was
her arrival on July 30 at Genoa from
New York, so that apparently she was
sunk on the return voyage to the
United States. She was commanded
by Captain 'Lavarello.
The Stampalia has accommodations
for about 1,500 persons. On her re
cent voyages from Italy to the United
States passenger traffic has been light
and. the agents in New York of the
line said today she probably carried
a comparatively small number of pas
sengers. , Her crew numbered about
170. t
Arriving at New York on March 24,
the Stampalia reported that a wire
less warning had been received soon
after leaving Genoa that a submarine
was lying in wait for her off Sardinia.
Instead of going north of Sardinia
and along the north shore of the Med
iterranean which before that time had
proved the safest route she went
south of Sardinia and through the
Straits of Bonifacio, between Sardinia
and Corsica. ' .
Several armed Italian steamships
have reported sighting submarines in
the Mediterranean and in some in
stances being pursued by them and
firing on them. When the Italian
steamship Re D'ltalia arrived at New
York from Genoa recently her cap
tain reported she had fired on sub
marines in the Mediterranean. The
steamship was pursued for seven
hours and her passengers said they
believed one of the submarines had
been Isunk.
There has been some increase re
cently in submarine activity. The
naval expert of the Paris Temps wrote
on Thursday that the German cam
paign of submarines against merchant
ships was again in full swing, in ac
cordance with the German note to the
United States in February in which it
was said merchant ships carrying guns
could not be considered as peasemul
ships.
The Stampalia was built at Spezia
in 1909 and was owned at Genoa.
The New York agents for the Stam
palia said today that two weeks ago
they had received a cable message ad
vising them that all sailings of the
steamship had been cancelled. They
express the opinion, on this account
that the Stampalia had been requisi
tioned and was in the service of the
Italian government. In this case sho
would have no passengers on board.

State Final Position: "
President in Statement
After One Hour Con
ference With Heads of
Railroads Says Public
Has Right to Expect
Acceptance of Eight
Hour Day Program He
Has Outlined. .
' Washington, Aug. 19 Aftei,
an hour's conference with
President Wilson today, the 33
railroad presidents left the
White House- without giving
any indication that they . had
abandoned their stand for ar
bitration but with assurances -that
the negotiations were not
ended.
The railroad executives gave
no final answer to the Presi
dent's proposals but will delib
erate on them today and see
President Wilson again proba
bly Monday. .
In his address to the officials,
President Wilson said:
"If a strike conies, the public
will know where the responsi
bility restsJIt will not be upon
me." .f.
While the railroad presidents were
in conference with President Wilson
today, the President gave out a state
ment ouUining his plan of settlement
and saying:
"It seems to me a thoroughly prae-
tical and entirely fair program and X'
think the public has the right to ex-.-pect
its acceptance."
President Wilson's statement fol
lows: "I have recommended the conces
sion of the eight hour that is the ,
substitution of an eight hour day for
the present ten hour- day in the ex
isting' practices and agreements. I
made this recommendation because I
believe the concession right The
eight hour day now undoubtedly has
the sanction of the judgment of so
ciety in its favor and should be adapt- . '
ed as a basis for wages even where the
actual work to be done cannot be '
completed within eight hours.
'"Concerning the adjustments which
should .be made. In Justice to the rail
roads and their stockholders, in the
payment and privileges to which their
men are now entitled (if such adjust
ments are necessary) there is a wide
diverKen"" of ninion.
"The railroads, which have already
adopted ue ' e.ut hour day, do not '
seem to be at any serious disadvantage
In respect of their cost of operation as
compared with the railroads that have
retained the 10 hour day and calcu
lations as to the cost of the change
must if made now, be made without
regard to any possible administrative
economies, or readjustments.
"Only experience can make it cer
tain what re-arrangements would be
fair and equitable, either on behalf
of the men or on behalf of the rail
roads. That experience would be ade
quate guide to the interstate com- '
merce commission, for example in
determining whether, as a conse- '
quence of the change, it would be
necessary and right -to authorize an
increase of rates for the handling and
carriage of freight (for passenger ser
vice is not affected).
"I, therefore, proposed that the de
mand for extra pay for overtime made
by the men and the contingent pro
posals of the railroad authorities, be
postponed until facts' shall have taken
the place of calculations and forecast
with regard to the effects of a change
to the eight-hour day; and that in
the meantime, while experience was
developing the facts, I should seek
and, if need be, obtain authority from
Congress to appoint a small body of
impartial men to observe and thor
oughly acquaint themselves with the '
results, with a view to reporting to
Congress at the earliest possible time
the facts disclosed by their inquiries
but without recommendation of any
kind; and that it should then bo. en- -tirely
open to either or both parties -to
the present controversy to give -notice
of a termination of the present
agreements with a view to instituting
inquiry into suggested readjustments
to pay or practice.
"This seems to be a thoroughly
practical and entirely fair program
and I think that the public has the
right to expect its acceptance."
The employes' committee of $40
having voted to accept President Wil-
son's plan and thereby "put the things
up to the railroads" had another meet
ing today to talk things over.
