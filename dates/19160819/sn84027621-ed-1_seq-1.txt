carried two small defensive guns. She
was 476 feet long and displaced nine

(Associated Press)
London, Aug. 19. There is a cer
tain small section of British ;water
f ront where more ships are under con
struction today than the entire, ship
building facilities of any other nation
could undertake at one time. They
include every type of craft from sub -marines
to battleships and from steam
trawlers to Atlantic liners. Most gov
ernments lay down their battleships
and cruisers singly, and the lesser
craft perhaps in pairs, but here bat
tleships loom up as twins, light
cruisers by the half dozen, destroyers
in rows of ten, with many braces of
long submarines, and an . occasional
monitor.
The war fleet under the hammer
and the paint brush here would rank
in the naval list above the establish
ments of several modest maritime
powers It could demolish the two
squadrons which fought the battle of
Manila Bay with one volley, and then
steam against the combined American
and Spanish fleets of Santiago with
confidence. And the merchant ships
in the stocks are as many as the Unit
ed States merchant marine has added
to its register in several years.
"We have trained crews to step on
board all these ships as soon as they
are fitted,' a naval officer remarked.

MANAGERS OF RAILROADS HAVE HOT AGREED, BUT AflOTHEfi
COflFEREHCE WILL BE HELD MOIIDAY
(Associated
Washington, Aug. 19.- After ''an
hour's conference with President Wil
son, thirty-three railroad presidents
today left the White House without
giving any indication that they had
abondoned their stand for arbitration,
which' their spokesman, President
Holden of the Burlington, told the
president was a greater principle than
the hours and wages involved. ,
PRESIDENTS PROPOSAL
Meanwhile the president gave out a
statement outlining his proposals for
concessions of an eight hour day and
for a special commission to investi
gate the demands for "extra pay and
overtime by the brotherhoods and con-,
tingent proposals by the railroads.
The president said: "This seems a
thoroughly practicable and entirely
fair program and I think the public
has a right to expect its acceptance."
MAY CONFER MONDAY .
" : .- '' ' ' ' ,' ' -The
railroad heads gave no final
answer today and will continue to de
liberate. The president will again
probably confer with them "Monday.
While the majority of the railroad
presidents are understood to be un
yielding In their attitude, the predom
inant report was that some didn't
want to hold out to the point of a
strike.
SANCTIONED BY SOCIETY'
President Wilson's statement - said
that the eight-hour day now has the
sanction of society and should be
adopted as a wage basis, even where
the actual work can't be done in eight
hours. He said the railroads which
have already adopted it don't seem to
suffer any serious disadvantage. He
said if necessary after a fair trial of
his proposal, which the brotherhoods
had already adopted, the matter could
be thrashed out again.
RECOUNTING THE VOTES

yesterday afternoon, with all but
three precincts in the county recount

his lead by six votes over his oppon
ent, Frank Adams. The commission
ers meet again at 3 o'clock this after

in the race will not be known until the
court passes its judgment on the re
count, disposing of the ballots thrown
out and the missing ballots of the
Fort McCoy precinct.
