side- now here before they leave Wash

In their formal statements the rail
road officials Insisted on arbitration on
the pround that if they pave ln this
time It would mean the abandonment
of the principle of arbitration, and be
cause they feared if they pranted the
eight-hour '' 1 with its consentient
added expenses without resort to arbi

they might make liter to the Inter

On the surface the threatened strike
appeared nearer to-day than at ;i?v time
since the negotiations at the White
House began, but administration of
ficials continued to believe that event
ually there would be an agreement
Having accepted the President's plan
of settlement, the committee of em

The railroad presidents and officials
conferred with the President less than
an hour. After Mr. Wilson had ex
plained his Plan. Hale Holden. presi
dent of the Chicago. RurllnPton and
Qulncy, actlncr as spokesman, informed
the President that the officials present
could speak only for their Individual
roads, and that the conference com
mittee of managers was the only body
with power to accept or reject pro
posals.

It was Indicated plainly to Mr. Wil
con that the officials were inclined to
stand behind the previous attitude of
the managers' committee in refusing to
accept the eight-hour day, and that they
believed the proposal to be Impractica
ble. The President was told, however,
that the plan would be given further
consideration and a report made to
him to-morrow.
Mr, Wilson explained to the rail
road officials that he had drawn up
the plan because he thought it fair
and because he believed a way must
be found for averting a strike. lie
urged them to demonstrate a spirit of
concession and to assist him in settling
the controversy. To-night the railroad
officials held another long conference

The article-; of war have not been
revised in 1'? years, and are said to
be sadly deficient for dealing with con
ditjons which growth ?.f the army and
development of tfie nation require The
War Department j- especially anxious
fnr changes to enable army officers to
deal adequately with problems arisinc
i during the present Mexican service.
Included in the revision marked out
by Concress over the objection of the
President and the War Department,
was a provision which exempted re
tired officers from courts-martial and
army discipline, if not actually from
army control, and placed them under
; the jurisdic'ion of the civil courts. It
I is common understanding among army
, officers that the section covered 'he
j case of a certain retired officer, for
1 merly regarded as a power in shaping
1 military lectslation. who was prepar
ing to write a book and hesitated to
do it while liable to discipline
The President, in his veto, however,
made no reference to this phase of the
situation.
