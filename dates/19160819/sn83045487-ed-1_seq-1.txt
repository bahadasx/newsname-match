WM.. HALfe THOMPSON,
MAYOR Of CHICAGO:
Say, Bill N-. ,
before election I sent a reporter lb yea to see -what you stood for, ani
I published the interview. Knowing o&se-seekers often feel more kladly
toward the plain folks before election tkaa afterward, I sent a reporter to
see you" after you had "been elected. Yo told him you would go through
on the p61icies you had announced during the campaign, latere is the most
important thing you said in that interview affer the election:
"WHATEVER THE MAJORITY OP THE PEOPLE WANT, I AM FOB.
I DON't'cARE WHAT NEWSPAPERS OR POLITICAL FORCES ARE
AGAINST ME SO LONG AS I HAVE THE PBOfcLE WITH ME."
That was all righC It was platform esough. You started in with,
'your politics on straight and you started in with the people with you
