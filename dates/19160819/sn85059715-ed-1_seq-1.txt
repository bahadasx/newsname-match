WASHINGTON, Aug. 10.?After
an hour's conference with President
Wilson Saturday, the thlrtv-three
railroad presidents left the White
House without giving any indication
that they had abandoned their stand
for arbitration, but with assurances
that the negotiations were not ended.
The railroad executives gave no final
answer to the president's proposals,
but will deliberate on them today
and pee President Wilson again,
probably Monday,
While the railroad presidents were
in conference with President W'ilson.
the president gave out a statement
outlining his plan of settlement and
saying:
"It seems to me a thoroughly practical
and entirely fair program, and
1 think the public has the right to
expect Its acceptance."
In his address to the oflleials President
Wilson said:
"If a strike conies the public will
know where the responsibility rests.
It will not he upon me."
One ray of hope that it might induce
the railroad managers to make
concessions stood out in a suggestion
that the Interstate Commerce Commission
might determine whether it
would be right to increase freight
rates to meet the added compensation
to employes. The railroad presidents
indicated they would make a state
fmcnt soon. J;li

The employes committee of 6 4 0
having voted to accept President Wilson's
plan and thereby "put the thing
up to the railroads," had another
meeting today to talk matters over.
' Out of the maneuvering of both
(!ides for a position which will enjoy
Hie support of public opinion came
many evidences that each is working
lo organize public sentiment in its
favor. ' t
It was understood that the railroads
are turning to other large employers
of labor throughout the country
to express their support lor the
preservation of the principle of arbitration
as a settlement of industrial
disputes, while President Wilson and
Ihe employes are drawing support
front large manufacturing and other
Interests vitally concerned in keeping
the railroads open for business, and
from those who want to see the eighthour
