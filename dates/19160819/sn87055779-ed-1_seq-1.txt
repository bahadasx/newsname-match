FUM WANTS
TROOPS RECALL
Believes Pershing Expedition
Can Accomplish Nothing
Further in Mexico.
lntiriiatinal News Service:
WASHINGTON. Aus?. 10. Al
though Sec'y of War Paker refused
point blank today to comment on the
report that Gen. Funston has asked
of the war department the immedi
ate withdrawal of the Pershing ex
pedition, it was learred on excellent
authority that this is the position of
the border commander-in-chief.
Funston. in a report sent to the
war department last niht declared
that the object of the Pershing expe
dition into Mexico the disposal of
Yilla and his band had been ac
complished. Retaining the troops
there und r the exceedingly dis
agreeable restrictions placed on their
move-merits by the state department,
was a constant source of trouble,
Funston reported. They cannot
move from their present bases, Fun
ston pointed out, and so lon as
they stay in Mexico a his force must
he held in reserve to protect lines of
communication.
The fact that Funston has made
this report has caused reat dissat
isfaction at the state department,
where it is admitted it may compli
cate tlie negotiations for ;i commis
sion. The administration wants to
keep the troops in Mexico so that
they may have something to trad?
cn in the proposed neotiaitons.
Am a result it is understood here that
the state department has demanded
that the Funston report be sent back
to the general at San Antonio with
instructions that it cannot be con
sidered ar i must be withdrawn.
Will staiul Pat.
Persons In re who know Gen. Fun
step, declare that lie will stand pat
on his rev o m me a da lion. He would
not have ic.ole any such s.;-;-;estions.
o:!.i ;als who know him say, unless
he was ntiiflv convinced that such
action was necessiry. However, in
v a w of exi.-tinc conditions, otheial
declared it was doabtfal whether
anv actum would be taken tot with
draw IVrhins pending the naming
of the joint t oinnussion.
It :s understood th;: the Funston
de elopment . has lp.ade it essential
that the American members of the
ji int commission be named at once,
and it is expected that S.-c'y LirnuT.
n returning from Annapolis Mon
day, will take up names of candi

"It i. possible for woman to re

K. P. Kline in his lecture on "Shake
speare's Teachings on Ambition
Saturday morning at the Chautau
qua, is perhaps the most striking
teaching of the great play of "Mac
beth" which he took as the text for
his talk. "If in Shakespeare's time
there nad been any great woman
actors or if Shakespeare were to
have lived today when the sphere of
womanhood has so greatly broaden
ed," said the speaker, "this play
doubtless would have bean named
"Lady Macbeth."
"When the suffragists in attempt
ing to prove the executive power
and the: superior morality of the
woman in public life point to Queen
Victoria exploiting her goodness
and the marvellous accomplish
ments of her reign, they merely
shovv the shallow reasoning which is
characteristic of the vast majority
of us. Quocn Victoria was a won
derfully beautiful and good queen,
but she was a queen only in name.
She wa.s in no way responsible for
the great accomplishments of her
reign. She was the merest figure
head. "The revolution which ---onverted
China a country of 45".OuOooO of

stupendous event in all history, and

Airman Gets 14th Victim.
International Nes Servim:
I)N'WX. Aujt. 10. The 9.00O-

sunk, presumably by a submarine,
says a dispatch to L,loyds today.
The tampilia bailed from Genoa.
Slie was 4 76 feet lonjj and 0 3 feet
in the beam and was built in lHt?.
The .Stanipilia was in N the New

Genoa on July f,0.
The ship was owned by the Ii
Veloee lino and carried two :i-inch
puns for defensive purposes, loth
mounted at the stern. She was
commanded by Capt. Ii varello.
The Stampilia is believed to have
been bounc. from Genoa to New
York when attacked and she was
prooaiuv carrying a passenger
list.
The Mediterranean sea has Ion'-?
been infested by swarms of both
Austrian and German submarines
and it is supposed that one of the

jiManagers Decline Invitation To Join Superiors
In Conference With Wilson Which Is
Resumed at White House
Saturday Morning
Iidernathui.il New Scrvi -e:
WASHINGTON, Ail;. 19. Miile hc railway prcsMcnte were
today carefully explaining t Pres't Wilson why" in their opinion,
they couki not immediately Qrant to their employes the right-hour
working day the president' issued to the public wh.tt was in effect
an ultimatum to the roads demanding that thev accept his plan on
trial.
In his statement the president declared that the eight-hour day
has the sanction of society in its favor and should be adopted even
in cases where tlie work called for could not be done in eight
hours. . He declared that only through experience can it be dem
onstrated whether it is true that the railroads cannot carry on busi
ness by granting this concession as it will require that experience
to fhow the interestate commerce commission the facts.
The president demanded that the
railroaas con ede the proposition al-readj-
acva pted by the men and per
mit the overtime question and tlie
contingent proposals of the railroads
to be passed upon by a congressional
commission. The president inist.s
that such coniinis. if!n shall aeer'ain
the facts and report, but shall make
no recommendations.
It was accepted i'i otticiai cir K':
that the president's statement a
designed to hold the railroads re
sponsible if thev- hh.iil continue t o
refuse to accept his plan and insi.-t
on arbitration of all tlie .jue-iions at
bsue.
The president's statement w:ls as
follows;
"1 have recommend' d eonceslon
of an eiuht-hour d.tv -th it is, the
substitution of an ciglit-iiour day
for the present pi-huur day in all
the existing practices of agreement
between the railroads and the in-n.
I made this recommendation b-'rau.-o
1 believe the concessions right. The
ei'-rht-hour day now nndo ilt. dly la.s
