plan they met former Sheriff
O. Heed, of Allen l'urish, and Os
car Tate, of Kinder, at a point
above Kit oil. The mectiiiir took
place just after dark.
y Kcuchi Ii «r the old Putnam mill,
west of Basile, Sheriff Heid st a
tioiicd Iiis men along the road
running west of Kinder. He
placed himself near the steps
leading up on to the mill plal
form. The posse waited here un
til two o'clock this i the
hour at which, their guide m
formed them, ('arrière would he
along the road.
Five minutes later Sheritl Kcid
saw a
man walking along the
highway, but on account of the
thickness of the bci sh could not.
distinguish his features. lie
thought it might be a member of
his own posse and the man had
mounted the steps on to the milhwas
platform before the sheriff saw
that it was h]s quarry. In the!
bright moonlight he casly identi- ,
lied the outlaw hy his costume '
ami the winchester that he car ,
rii<d.
The first intimation that
riere had of the presence of the
posse whs then Sheriff Reid called

mediately whirled, facing the
woods, and brought his > gnu into
position to fire. Ilciug able to
•ee no one lie .turned again and
tried to run into thê mill.
Just as the bandit entered the
fthadow formed by the mill shed
Sheriff Reid fired a lt»ad of buck
•hot which struck Carrière in the
hack of his left shoulder and he
fell on the platform. The rest of
the posse gathered in the edge of
the woods by the steps and waited
«evcral mimltes. Carrière mak
ing no hogtile move, thev walked
up oh the platform, disarmed him,
and vrave him attention.
After the posse had given him
water to drink and washed off his
face the outlaw gpoke a few brief
sentenced. He told the men of
the posse that if he had gotten
the chance he would have showed
them a "good time." A few
minutes later he said that he bad
wanted to kill several men be
fore he was captured. He said
there was a man named Har
honne at Oherlin, and then a
whole lot of others.
Sorry Two Negroes
Did Not Die.
The only statement he made to
the officers in regard to the
Swords killing was that he was
sorry the two negroes he shot had
not tlicd.
Carrière was placed in the
posse's automobile ami taken to

his wounds. Although it was 4

riere, a minute later. "If T had

to have seen some of them fall

Carrière complained of his
wounds paining him, and ex
pressed a desire to die before
morning.
Two buckshot which entered
his left lung just below the shoul
der blade may cause his death
within a few hours, according to
physicians. Whenever be breathes
the blood ooze* out of his lungs.
Carrier made an informal
statement this morning to District
Attornev Arthur Edwards, bnt
later refused to nut it in writing.
He claimed self-defense for the
killing of Have Pierce, an aged
fisherman, over whom the whole
trouble started: said that he bad
killed a negro 'bov in the Mallet
woods because the latter had been
offered $25 to betray him. and re
peated his statement to the effect
♦ hat he killed Sheriff Swords and
tried to kill Iiis deputies because
the latter bad come after him with
negroes instead of white men.
Be?s That He Be Killed.

the capture of < 'arrière.
The Calcasieu officials stopped
only lony; enough to give ( arrière
it drink of water and then went
on to Iiiil<c < liarles. where every
effort will he made to save tile
life of the man that slew Marion
Swords. Dr. T. S. Smith, of Kl

that Carrière carried his famous
old "Betsy", 44-ealiber rifle,
Sheriff Reid took no further chan
ces. Two shots from his double
barreled shotgun in rapid succes
sion brought Carrière down, and
the bHlance of the posse were
quickly on the scene.
Carrière on examination was
found to have received thirteen
buckshots in the 'back of the neck
and shoulder, completely paralyz
ing his right arm po that his rifle
was useless by his side. Carrière
cursed and rawd at the officers
and told them they were traitors
who had stolen his life. He
begged that they take his fav

head off.

This is impressive. Standing
on such a record of accomplish

entitled to feel confident. The
attack upon their position must
be made from another angle. The
indications are that it is on thc

to kiss the bride after thc cere

about to be married in this church
did not relish the prospect and
instructed her prospective hus

she did not wish him to kiss her.
