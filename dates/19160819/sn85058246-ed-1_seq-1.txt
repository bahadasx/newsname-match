I LOGAN BANKER
L IS A TUTOR OF
1 BANK CASHIERS
When one looks about the town and
points out this man and that man and
asks himself what has any or those
men done' that distinguishes them In
the community, there are few men In
Logan who have not done something
worth while as we- have so many
gocd men In this community. It
must be with a degreo of satisfaction
that Mr. A. M. Fleming looks nbout
and watches the progress of tho young
men who have sorved under him, hav
ing received their apprenticeship In
banking while working In tho First
Natonal Bank.
Thcro aro not many residents of
Logan who know It, but It Is a fact
that tho four cashLers of tho four
bunking Institutions In the city, ob
tained their first experience In bank
ing while at tho Klrst National
Bank during tho tlmo Mr. Fleming
was cashier of that Institution.
Mr. Fleming 1ms one other cashier
to his credit. E. J. Broberg was re
commended to the American Nation
al Bank of San Francisco by this
Logan banker. It Is a fact, too that
the cashiers of the Logan banking
Institutions glvo Mr. Fleming credit
for what success they have mado In
their chosen professions. Ho was a
man who was painstaking and exact
ing, yet constderato of those who
worked under his direction.
J. E. Shepard, cashier of tho Cache
Valley Bank; H. E. Crockett, cashier
of tho First National Bank; O. W.
Adams, cashier of the Thatcher Bros.
Dank, and A. II. Homer, cashier of
tho Farmers and Merchants Bank, all
hold Mr .Fleming In tho highest es
teem and hall him as a man thorough
ly conversant with the. essentials of
banking, and a man who has very few
peers as a bank tutor.

MOULDY 8ILAGE 18 FOUND M
TO POISON 8TOCK M
From experiments conducted at tho 'R
Illinois Station It has been found that '
mouldy sllago has caused u great i
many deaths to horses and cattle. Ex.
perts have studied results of feeding 'M
mouldy sllago for some time. They
have visited farms whero poisoning 'M
has been reported. They havo con
ducted experiments on mice, pigs, rab- !
bits and chickens, thus far, those mil-
tnals havo not given a positive test. H
Several horses wero brought for ex- H
pcrlmontal purposes and fud with H
mouldy silage. Four dnys after feed-
Ing, symptoms of poisoning showed
thcmsalves. On tho 5th day, one 'M
horso died nnd within a period of
three weeks threo moro hors.93 died, H
Tho remaining horso will undoubted jH
ly dlo too. j
It Is apparent from theso experl- BAfl
nicnts that farmers aro not justified H
In trying to cconomlzo by feeding fl
horses nnd cnttle sllago that tics be- yM
come spoiled. iM
