ON FUNSTON'S
TROOP REPORT
War Department Admits Gen
eral Has Reoommended
Withdrawal of Forces.
BLISS HOME FROM BORDER
Army Officers, According to Re
port, Have Known Funston's
Attitude.
President Wilson has before him
today the unqualified recommenda
tion of Alaj. Gen. Frederick Funs
ton for withdrawal of General
Pershing's army from Mexico.
Up to this time President Wilson
has refused to accept the recom
mendation and order the army
back to the American side.
Indications today were that he
would ignore the recommendation
for the present, but that prepara
tions would be continued looking
toward withdrawal at the earliest
possible moment.
MOVE A SURPRISE.
The Immediate effect of General Fun
ston's recommendation was to cause
consternation In the State Department,
where preparations wore nearing com
pletion for appointment of a commis
sion to settle with Mexico this very
question of withdrawing troops.
One result, officials admitted, may
be to cause tho Mexican and American
governments to draw up an entirely
new program for tho negotiations of tho
mediation commissioners.
With General Funston, commanding
the army In Mexico and on the bor
der, flatly stating there la no further
military need for maintaining troops
In Mexico, It was apparent to all of
ficials the United States could not
continue to Insist on keeping them
there.
Takes Issue With Wilson.
President Wilson, who sent the
troops Into Mexloo and Is the only
man with power to order their with
drawal, has repeatedly said In notes
to the Mexican government the troops
are still needed In Mexico.
General Funston, to whom the
President has Intrusted supreme
military command In Mexico, now
takes issue with the President and
says there Is no further need or
troops south of the Rio Grande.
The White House. State and Navy
departments did their utmost to keep
news of Funston's recommendations
from reaching the public.
Secretary of War Baker refused,
flatly to discuss Funston's recommen
dations. "The War Department policy," he
said, "Is not to discuss rumors. The
department will only discuss Its ac
tions." War Department officials said no
steps had been taken to order the
withdrawal of troops.
Secretary Lansing refused to dlscuan
Funston's recommendations or any
change In the Mevlcan commission
plans that may be occasioned by them.
Also Urged by Pershing,
It developed today that a month ago
General Pershing recommended the
withdrawal of his column, since under
the orders given him he was compelled
to remain Inactive In hlB Mexican
camps.
General Funston, In recommending
that tho troops be brought out, said
that there was no longer any military
neoesstty for their remaining, since
the Villa bands had been dispersed and
General Pershing was without author
ity to continue his campaign against
the luindlta.
General Funston held that border pro
tection Is well assured by the 100,000 mlll
tla on tne boraer, supplementing tne
regular army forces in border camps,
which, by withdrawal would be supple
mented by the 12,000 to 15,000 troops now
In Mexico.
General Funston further reported that
the health of General Funston's com
mand will be Imperiled by remaining In
Mexican camps during the onoomlng hot
Beoson, which now Is opening up after
protracted rains.

Wilson Explains Eight-Hour
Thinks Public
I have recommended the concession of the
eight-hour day that is, the substitution of an
eight-hour day for the present ten-hour day in
all the existing practices and agreements.
I made this recommendation because I be
lieved the concession right
The eight-hour day now undoubtedly has
the sanction of the judgment of society In its
favor and should be adopted as a basis for
wages even where the actual work to be done
cannot be completed within eight hours.
Concerning tho adjustment which should be
made in justice to the railroads and their
stockholders In the payments and privileges to
which their men are now entitled (if such ad
justments are necessary), there 1b a wide di
vergence of opinion.
The railroads which have already adopted
the eight-hour day do not seem to be at any
serious disadvantage in respect of their cost of
operation as compared with the railroads that
have retained the ten-hour day, and calcula
tions as to the cost of the change must, if made
now, be made without regard to any possible
administrative economies or readjustments.
Only experience can make it certain what
rearrangement would be fair and equitable
either on behalf of the men or on behalf of the
railroads. That experience would be a defi

Many Inquiries have been mado to E.

nite guide to tho Interstate Commerce Com
mission, 'for example, in determining whether,
as a consequence of the change, it would be
necessary and right to authorise an increase
of rates for tho handling and carriage of

i I, therefore, proposed that the demand for
extra pay for overtimo made by the men and
the contingent proposals of the railroad au
thorities be postponed until facts have taken
the place of calculation and forecast with re
gard to the effect of a change to the eight-hour
day; that, in the meantime, while experience
waa developing the facts, I should seek and, If
need be, obtain authority from the Congress to
appoint a small body of impartial men to ob
serve and thoroughly acquaint themselves with
the results with a view to reporting to Con

then be entirely open to either or both parties

This seems to me a thoroughly practical
and entirely fair program, and I think that
the public has the right to expect its acceptance.

President Wilson toda& ta
statement of his pj-oposal for set
tlement of the difficulty between
the railroods of the cotjnjry tad
the railroad brotherhoods, indicated
his intention to stand pat on his'
insistence that the ejgjit-hoar day
eb granted the workers.
"This seems to me a thoroughly
practical and entirely fain pro
gram," he said, "and I think the
public has a right te expect its ac
ceptance." The statement was issued Joat
after thirty-three railway heads
had assembled at the White House
to give theirreply to the proposi
tion. Their reply was unfavorable.
STILL FOR ARBITRATION.
President Holden, of the C. B. & Q.,
spokesman for the railway presidents,
told the President that tey continued
to stand for arbitration and did not
bellevelt right he should ojik them to
abandon that principle. He made it
pla,ln, however, that the tiill power of
attorney to reject or accept the Presi
dents plan lay 'finally with the rail
way managers committee.
The conference with the executives
broke up at 12:20. 'it waa featured by
a brief general discussion after Presi
dent Holden had finished outlining the
position of the railroad heids.
Conslderabl encouragement In the
outlook was seen In the faet that on

the executives would confer with the
President again. No hour has been

TK President closed the confarenCA

He sold he could not act as a Judge,
but only make suggestions. He offer

Into effect.
When the commission has been ap

Pending an Investlratlon bv this com

faced by, a wide difference of opinion on
the part of the men and the'managers
as to the task of applying the eight-

unable to Judge which contention was
right.
