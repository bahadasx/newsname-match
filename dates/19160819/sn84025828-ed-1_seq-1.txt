terest in "Fire Appliances."
There are citizens who believe that
It la contrary to good public policy In
a tree country to put too many ot the
public offices In one community In
the possession of members of a single
family.
The threats made by members ot
the Connery Gang to put The Eaglo
out of business impelled this news
paper to ferret out Just what grasp
the Connerys have on public affairs.
The result la startling and of In
terest to taxpayers, voters and the
public generally.
No wonder some ot this gang of
public payroll ornaments bellevo that
they can use the United Btates Gov
eminent In their business.
They evidently have found the
.State of Illinois,
County of Cook and
City of Chicago
Very profltablo and easily worked
attachments to tho family possessions.
Democrats In Chicago are wonder
ing why all of the public Jobs are not
given to Connory's.
It may be due to the fact that there
are not enough Connerys to go around.
Connerys First!
What a noble family motto that is
to bo sure.
And often has the Democratic party
fallen for tho Connorya and their well
known hankering for good things.
"State Streot Store" Blocki as you
may have heard him referred to, a
partner ot John T. Connery In the coal
business, is a member of the Board
of Review.
William J. Connery, nephew ot John
T. Connery, holds the nice-salaried
Job of Secretary of Reviewer Blocktr
Partner Blocki will run tor re-election
next year, so prepare your bal
lots. Good stories ot city contracts and
of other contracts In which the Con
aery connections were alleged to hay
'been Interested are not so far forgot
ten that the public Interest in them
ever wholly died out
There was a number of talented
Democratic leaders who held office or
contracts under the Busse BUSINESS
administration.
We have referred to aome of these
worthies before as our flies will at
test. But talking of the Busse BUSINESS
administration, Democrats do not for
get the party treason which, brought
It about.
Democrats do not forget the dose
that some membors of the Connery
gang gave Mayor Dunne In 1007 when
he was running for re-election.
Although looked upon by many in
the light of the Royal Family ot the
Democratic party, entitled to most,
it not to all, of the Jobs in its gift,
the Connery's are alleged to have
given such great support to Busse
and to have worked so hard ot defeat
Dunne that Busse'a gratitude was
great.
When John W. Ralney, always a
good Democrat and an able man, was
running for Clerk of the Circuit Court
in 1912, the Connery 'outfit fought
him at the polls in favor of Joseph
E. Bldwill, Jr., a Republican.
When Robert M. SwelUer was run
ning for the Domocratio nomination
for Mayor In 1015, the Connerys saw
another chance to put a member ot the
family in that office and they trotted
out Francis D. Connery, then City
Clerk and now Comptroller of the
Sanitary District ot Chicago.
But the Democratic stomach waa
showing signs of balking at an over-
"diet of Connery and the noble Francis
D. was sent back to the payroll to
wait fpr another chance.
Sweltzer got the nomination and it

MUCH FAMILY POLITICS
Is said that the Connery following
did not forglvo him for crowding out
one ot the princes of the blood and
were not over-enthuslastlc for Swelt
zer's election to say the least.
This year the Connery's are not
asking for much.
It Is reported that Joseph E. Bid
will, Jr., son-in-law ot John T, Con
nery will not seek Republican nomi
nation for Clerk of the Circuit Court
against John W. Ralney, the present
efficient Democratic incumbent ot that
office.
Joseph F. Connery, a brother of
John T. Connery and a brother.of
Francis D. Connery and an uncle-in-law
of Joseph E. Bldwill, Jr., will seek
a renomlnatlon for Recorder ot Deeds
Michael M. Connery, brother of
John T., Joseph F., and Francis D.
Job as Inspector for Attorney Gen
eral Lucey. .
Henry E. Connery, brother ot Mich
ael M. Connery, Joseph F. Connery,
John T. Connery and Francis D. Con
nery, and 'incle of William J. Connery
and uncle-ln-law of Joseph E. Bldwell,
Jr., will hold his present lucrative Job
as State Bank Examiner.
Francis D. Connery, brother of Hen
ry E. Connery, Joseph F. Connery,,
John T. Connery and Michael M. Con
nery; uncle of William J. Connery
and uncle-ln-law of Joseph E. Bid
well, Jr., will retain his present 16,
000 a year Job as Comptroller of the
Sanitary District of Chicago.
State Street Blocki, the business
partner of John T. Connery, will not
have a chance to run again for his
present Job on the Board of Review,
until next year.
So William J. Connery, nephew ot
John T., Joseph F Francis D., and
Michael M. Connery will retain bis
nlce-salared Job as Blockl's Secretary.
But by next year a few more of
fices may be created for a few more
Connerys as it would be too bad to
have Blocki, Jobn T. Connery's part
ner In the coal business running on
a ticket where there was not another
member ot the Connery family to keep
him from getting lonesome.
Connery first the rest nowhere.

Items About Them; Gleaned from Printed
Personal Property Assessments; Also,
the Taxes Levied on Labor Unions.
The publlo Is naturally anxious to
know what personal property taxes
Its office holders pay. So much has
been said about the number ot Con
nerys holding public office In Chicago
that many inquiries have been made
aa to what personal property assess
ments are laid against these patriotic
persons by the Board of Assessors.
The printed lists ot personal proper
ty assessments for 1916 show the fol
lowing facts: ,
Joseph F. Connery, Recorder ot
Deeds, at a salary of $9,000 a year;
also said to be secretary of a grave
yard company, salary not learned and
real estate dealer at 134 South .La
Salle street. House, 2028 West Wash

Francis D. Connery, Comptroller of
Sanitary District ot Chicago, at $6,000
per year, moved since May 1 to 1128
Columbia avenue.
No assessment at that number.
The Board of Assessors makes
some very curious mistakes. It ap
pears from the following received .by
The Chicago Eagle, August 7, 1916,
and postmarked same date, that the
official printed assessment roll for dis
trict No. 4, Lake View, which omitted
CHICAGO, SaVTUBDAY, AUGUST

The circular winds up with this
statement:
"Other Connerys are holding offlco

The above circular circulated by
2Sth Ward Democrats at a recent pri
mary election only gives the relatives

iner If all of the ofilce-holdlng relatives
of all of the other Connerys outside
of Francis D. Connery w.cro published
It would have to be as a serial. No
one Issue of the paper could spare the
space for the names.
Inducing people to buy property be
cause of its proximity to Lako Mich

the enjoyment of the lake is one of
the many complaints Justly made by
Edgewater people against a gang of

Mr. John T. Connery's name and as
sessment, was at fault, as witness
this lotter:

Pdoplo know enough about this
Board ot Assessors to believe that it
would stop at nothing.
But no one suspected it ot being
so hardened as to commit a "typo

pear on the prluted assessment list
which Includes tho territory in which
his business offlco at 332 South Mich

The Miami Coal Company at 332 S.
Michigan avenue, ot which Mr. Con

Blocki is vice president, Is assessed
on a Full Valuo ot $3,000.

holding many publlo Jobs In Chicago.

POOR VOTE GETTERS
Although the Connerys Hold
Many Public Jobs They Are
Not Strong at the Ballot
Box.
At tho Democratic primary for Re
corder or Deeds in 1912 tho result
was:
Joseph F. Connery 50,313
Ills opponents 04,49a
So Connery was a minority nomi
nee. At tho samo primary John W. Ral
ney ran for the nomination tor Clerk
of tho Circuit Court, tho offlco hold by
Connery's Republican nophow-ln-law,
Joseph E. Bldwell, Jr. Result of tho
primary:
John W. Ralney 71,095
All opponents 44,006
Ralnoy's majority over
all 27,029
At tho samo primary in 1912 John
T. Connory's partnor in tho coal busi
ness, Blocki, was a candidato for tho
nomination for Board or Revlow. Tho
rosult:
Blocki, Connory's part
ner 39,415
His opponents 87,253
So Blocki, Connery a partner, was in
a minority ot 47,838 votes. One of bis
opponents, Charles J. Voplcka, came
near dofoating Blocki, Connory's part,
ner, receiving 38,089 votes to Blocki,
Connery's partner's 39,415.
In 1913, Francis D. Connery was a
candidate at tho Democratic primary
for tho nomination for City Clerk,
Francis D. Connery 42,187
His Democratic opponents 51,400
So Connory was vory much of a
minority candidate.
