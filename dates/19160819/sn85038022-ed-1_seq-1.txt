"The Square Deal Man"
Washington, Auguat 18 President
Wilson's plan for settlement of the
threatened nation-wide railroad strike
was accepted today by the railroad
employes and taken under considera
tion by the officials of the roads, with
many Indications that they would re
ject It tomorrow. The word came
from the managers tonight, however,
that they had reached no definite de
cision.
With the situation left apparently
at a deadlock,, the only hope lay in
reports that the railroad officials
might suggest a counter proposal
forming the basis of a settlement or
that one side or the other might re
cede) from Its present position.
Thirty-one presidents and ranking
officials of the great railroads re
ceived from the President hla plans
for the adoption of an eight-hour day.
regular pro rata pay for overtime and
creation of a federal commission to
Investigate collateral issues. They
told him they would like to consider
the question and would report back
tomorrow with the committee of man
agers which has been conducting ne
gotiations. I
Arlbtratlon still Preferred
At the same time the general com
mittee of 640 representatives of the
omployes were approving the Presi
dent's plan by a lame majority and
soon after the officials left the White
House the four heads of the railroad
Brotherhood delivered to the Presi
dent a letter notifying him of the
Vote. The employes committee will
remain here at the President's call.
While the railroad officials would
make no formal statement they re
vealed clearly their opposition to Mr
Wilson's plan and indicated that they
would nass further their offer to
arbitrate all the points at issue.
In spite of these developments, it
was reported the officials might sug
gest a counter proposal baaed on the
acceptance of the eight-hour day and
arbitration of all other points instead
of the Investigation by a federal com
mission proposed under the Presi
dent's plan. It was stated positively,
however, that the officials had reach
ed no definite decision on their fu
ture course.
Flnanrert Last Resort
In case the President finds no hope
bf settlement during his conference
with the railroad officials tomorrow
he probably will summons to Wash
tngton some of the powerful finan
ciers of the country serving as direc
tors of the railroads. Administration
officials said tonight he had by no
means given up hope of effecting a
Settlement and was determined that
It shall be reached, If possible, before
the representatives of both sides now
liere leave Washington.
In their official statement the rail
road officials insisted on arbitration
on the grounds that if they gave in
this time it would mean the abandon
ment of the principle of arbitration
and because they feared if they grant-
led the eight-hour day, with its conae
quent added expenses, without resort
to arbitration, it would prejudice any
appeal they might make later to the
lnterestate Commerce Commission for
higher freight rates.
Strike Appears nearer
On the surface, the threatened
Btrike appeared nearer today than at
any time since the negotiations at the
White House began, but adiulnlatra
tion officials continued to believe
some concessions would be made, and
that eventually there would be an
agreement. Having accepted the
President's plan of settlement, the
committee of employes took no fur
ther action tonight and awaited de
velopnients. They were expuctlng
summonses to the White House again
after the meeting tomorrow between
Mr. Wilson and the railroad officials

STOCK PENS
Of the C. A O. Railroad Will Re IN -
moved From the Present Location
to Limestone Street Yards.
Superintendent J. B. Harris of the
Cincinnati division of the C. & O. Rail
road was in this city yesterday and in
a conference with Mayor Lee showed
"him the plans for the building of new
stock pens In the company's yards on
Limestone street.
The pens will be made of concrete
and will be up-to-date in every (artic
ular. The floor will be of concrete as
will be the fences. Flushers will be
placed in the pens to allow them to be
frequently cleaned. The work will
begin within the next sixty days.
Several days ago the Board of
Health notified the C. & O. that they
would be expected to clean up the
place at once. This will be done Im
mediately but will be temporary. Cin
ders were ordered from Silver Grove
I
and the place will be cleared up quite
a bit
The move of building new stock
pens is a good one and will greatly
help the farmers In the western part
of the county. They have had to
drive all the way through the town
with their stock and often times this
is a great deal of work for them. The
pen will be centrally located and a
great Improvement over the old ones
