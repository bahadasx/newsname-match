Champ Clark Opens Demo
cratic Campaign With a
"Wilson Speech in Maine.
Brunswick. Maine, Aug. 19. Champ
Clark, speaker of the house of repre
sentatives, opened the campaign in
Maine for the Democrats today in a
characteristic speech in which he told
of the accomplishments of the admin
istration and congress under the lead
ership of president Wilson.
Mr. Clark said In part:
"Judge Hughes has made enough
speeches in this campaign to enable
intelligent persons to form something
approximating a correct judgment as to
his opinions on current issues. He has
shot his bolt, but has failed to hit the
bullseye.
"Comparing his speeches since he
was nominated for president with his
strong Youngstown, Ohio, speech in
1908, one is forced inevitably to one of
two conclusions: First, that his pen
and tongue have lost their cunning
measureably: or, second, that he has
nothing worth while to urge against
democratic accomplishment.
Speeches Are 'Qneralou Carping'
"His speeches may be not unfairly
summed up as 'querulous carplngs at
the splendid record of a Democratic
congress and a Democratic administra
tion. "He endeavors to make an issue of
the separation of Hon. E. Dana Durand
from the pay roll as director of the
census. I know Mr. Durand. He is an
estimable gentleman. But he had no
held
Cannot Make ltur of Durand.
"It is not within the power of Judge
Hughes or any other complaining
Durand any more than he can of who
struck Billy Patterson, or wno was ;ne
man in the iron mask?'
"He draws a general indictment
against Democratic diplomatic ap
pointments, but fails to give us the
specifications or the proof to sustain
the indictment.
Most American Patriotic.
"He says that he is In favor of 'un
diluted Americanism.' He is not pecu
liar in that respect. The vast mass of
the American people men and women
are too busy working at what the
Germans denominate 'the bread and
butter sciences' to .make elaborate
ftjreeches vaunting their- "'undiluted
Americanism," but tne average Ameri
can citizen is as patriotic as Charles
Evans Hughes. Woodrow Wilson or
any other big wig in the land.
Perhnp MlKtakes Have Been Made.
"Perhaps president Wilson has made
some mistakes. Perhaps the Demo
cratic congress has made some. Any
astronomer who has an adequate tele
scope can find spots on the sun, but
nevertheless and notwithstanding, the
sun continues to light and warm and
fructify the earth.
"We Have Prosperity.-"
"Judge Hughes with bis telescope is
hunting for spots on the Democratic
administration and the Democratic
congress but the people realize that
we hae the most unbounded prosperity
that has blessed the land since Chris
topher Columbus discovered America,
and that notwitnstanding the ancient
and chronic sneer of the Republicans

ing, that, acting under his orders, John

the deficit had occurred since the last
examination on June 10. The bank has
capital, surplus and undivided profits
of JS0.000. Thus only J40.000 will have

Eepublican Nominee is Not Interested in Local Differ
ences But Desires Country To TJnite On Program of
Definite and Patriotic Accomplishment; Declares
For Preparedness Und er Good Leadership.
AN FRANCISCO. CALIF. Aug. 19.
Charles E. Hughes told an audl-
W ence here Friday that he had no
concern with local differences In poli
tics, that "the great national alms" he
had in view transcended all possible lo
cal differences, and that he regarded
the Republican party as "reunited. In
spired by lofty traditions" and devoted
to the accomplishments of great
achievements.
Before making his address Mr.
Hughes had conferred with leaders here
over differences in California between
Progressives and Republicans. In his
address the nominee said:
"I come here as the spokesman of the
national Republican party. With local
differences I have no concern. The great
national alms I have in view transcend
all possible local differences and we
are together, reunited, inspired by the
loftiest traditions of our historic party
and devoted to the accomplishments of
those great achleevments upon which
must rest our enduring prosperity as
a nation."
Speaking of preparedness Mr. Hughes
said:
"I desire that we should take no
narrow view We live in a very critical
erpiod. There is a new world In pro
cess of formation. Out of the great
European conflict will issue a new
Europe, but there must be in a very
tiue sense a new Aemrica to meet the
exigencies of that time. It must be an
America that has found itself: it must
be an American that takes a long look

of a few years; even or a decade or &

20th century

dren. We must endeavor to have a con
tented America, an America contented
because of the prevalence of Just deal
ing between man and man. aided hy
i5o laws. - l
"We cannot afford. In looking into
the future.' to fall to take account of
the cause of discontent and of unrest.
We do not need to have a perennial
agitation In this country. All that Is
needed Is a firm sense of cooDeration
and of realization in our practical in
dustrial life, of those Ideals of human
brotherhood upon which our constitu
tional system Is based.
New Spirit Aproad.
"There is a new spirit. I believe,
abroad in the land. There is a disposi
tion to take account of Just grievances
and to provide reasonable remedies.
"We ca have a humanitarian out
look, which is absolutely essential be
cause it Is right from a human stand
pcint. and because It Is necessary from
an economic standpoint."
Proposes Constructive Tariff.
Hr. Hughes repeated his tariff views
and his pledge that no one would "put
over anything" for private gain at pub
lic expense in tariff adjustment if he
cculd help it
"I do propose, however," he said,
"that we shall have a constructive tar
iff policy which will foster, not cripple;
which will build ud. not destrov: which
will count American achievement hon- '
orable and not something to be re
duced; something which will set the
United States ahead worthy of compet
ing in this economic struggle with any !
nation on earth.
Reiterates Prepnrednes Views.
The nominee reiterated his views on
preparedness and assailed the adminis
tration for vacillation in respect to
preparations and for failure to prepare
for the Mexican crisis.
"Mixing politics and military prepar
ation is the worst thing that can ap
pen to a nation," he said.
Favors Army of Citizens.
Mr. Hughes said he favored an army
of citizens trained by the federal gov
ernment and responsible only to the
federal government as the nation's first
reserve. Of the navy, Mr. Hughes said:
"I am Informed on high authority
that our ships are under manned and
our supplies Inadequate. Our organi
zation is not what it should be. I do
not think that the administration of
that great department of the govern
ment reflects credit upon the American
people.
"Those who are Interested In prepar
edness are not simply content In study
ing lists of battleships. They know the
quality of our organization, the capaci
ty of our leadership. It is Important in
this country that we have patriotism,
not simply in declamation, but In effi
ciency of government. I
Is Money Well Spent.
"When I read of the hundreds of
millions appropriated for military and
naval purposes I am not satlrfied. I
want to know how that money Is spent.
I want to know whether we get in po
tency what we are paying for."
The nominee assailed the administra
tion for its diplomatic appointments.
"I deplore the extent to which men
of training have been removed from
the diplomatic service under this ad
ministration," Mr. Hughes said.
"Now I do not want anybody to say
that this is Just destructive criticism.
That is ontf side of the shield. On the
other side of the shield you will find
something else, this- That I propose
that we shall have trained men In our
diplomatic service."
Preparedness for Peace.
Reverting to preparedness, Mr.
Hughes said:
"Our preparedness will not be a pre
paredness that threatens; It will not
be a preparedness that means militar
ism' But it will be a preparedness that
now insures our peace and enlists us
D
Ai'tWIlRE
A llON'TH
in the future In the cause of the main
tenance of the peace of the world."
Mr. Hughes read the Democratic
platform plank of 1912. declaring for
the maintenance abroad of American
rights.
"That I believe." he said. "That I
propose to practice, not simply to
preach."
Deliver Three Addresses.
Mr. Hughes reached San Francisco at
1 qclock. went to his hotel through"
crowds which applauded him along the
way. held a reception shortly afterward
and made the first of his addresses be
fore the Union League club at 3 ociock.
He hurried back to his hotel and there
addressed a meeting of women voters.
At night he addressed a mass meeting
in the civic auditorium, which was pre
sided over by William H. Crocker, Re
publican national committeeman from
California.
Between addresses Mr. Hughes con
ferred with Republican and "ro-res-sive
leaders here inrthe interest of par
ty harmony. The nominee confined his
suggestions to a plea for cooperation.
