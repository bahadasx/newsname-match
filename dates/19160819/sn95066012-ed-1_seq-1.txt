London, Aug. 18. On the whole
front, from Puzlercs to the Somnie, the
Hritish and French troops took part in
a combined attack today, scoring suc
cesses at several points. The British
pushed their lines colser to the vil
lages of Ginehy and Guilleniont. tak

the French pushed forward in Maure
pas, gaining the greater part of the
village, and making progress on the
MaureposClery road to the southeast,
where they captured Calvary Hill.
Today's advance Is a part of the gen

TRIP TO G. M. C. CAMP
Club Arranges for Outing on Labor
Day.
At a meeting of the executive com
mittee of the Green Mountain club
last evening it was voted to have an
excursion and "open camp" on Labor
day. A trip will probably he made
over Trenor Meadows and down Hell
Hollow to the club camp. Arrange
ments will he completed later. It was
reported that the water In Somerset
dam is now being lowered so that the
section of trail between the dam and
the Grout job which has been partly
underwater should soon be passable.
TnVwater in the reservoir this sum
mer has been higher than at any time
since tue construction of the dam, ow
ing to the unusual amount of rain. The
depth has registered nearly 100 ft.
while normally during tho summer
months It has not been much over :,o
feet. Quite a number of hikers have
attempted to go over this section of
the Long Trail, much to their sorrow-
as making detours to avoid the Hooded
sections has necessitated going
through brambles and underbrush that
were almost Impassible. If the tower
ing water does not soon get below the
level of the trail a detour will be
marked around the east side of the res
ervolf.

there seems to be
jr less inisun-
den tan ding, He closo with an ap
peal for co-operation and urges the
closing of small tributary streams
Which contain trout that do not or
dinarily attain a legal size until they
have dropped into the larger waters.
The present law authorizes the com
missioner to close such streams, but
it cannot be done without the written
consent of the owners. Short term
closing of streams has not been found
advantageous. The commissioner
thinks it is bad policy to change the
laws every two years, one of the rea
sons for which being the fact that ii
takes about two years for the public
to become accustomed to changes, es
pecially as they apply to open and
close seasons.
The commissioner closes his circul
ar by stating that any persons desir
ing to be kept on the mailing list use
the postal card which he enclosed for
their present address. It is his inten
tion to send a copy of the bi-ennial
report, now in course of preparation,
to every person who takes advantage
of the postal card to forward his ad
dress, and the number of cards re
ceived will be his guide as to the num

BENNINGTON BOY ON. BORDER
Leo Nash Writes of His Experiences
at Eagle Pass, Tex.
Members of the family of Deputy
Sheriff John Nash have received let
ters fium Leo Nash, a member of the
Bellowa Kails company now with the
Vermont national guardsmen at Eagle
l'ass. He writes that every possible
effort is being made to keep the men
comfortable and in good health. There
is a moving picture theatre at the
camp and the Y. M. C. A. has a build
ing on the ground. At the time the
letter was written the Vermont guards
men were at work rebuilding the
camp, which would indicate that the
troops are expected to remain on the
border for some time.
The Hennington boy took up consid
erable space in his letter to describe
his experiences while a night guards
man on tlie International bridge over
the Hio Grande river. He was obliged
to search ever person who crossed
the bridge Into Mexico and relieve him
ol any contraband articles he might
have on his person. No one is allow
ed to carry llrearms, ammunition or.
heavy shoes across the border line.

WILSON STANDING
PAI ON 8-HOUR
MTJJI
; President Adhears to Position on
Threatened Railroad Strike
FAIR AND PROPER PROPOSAL
Chief Executive Says Public Has
Right to Expect Its
Acceptance.
Washington, Aug. 19. President
Wilson today in a statement in rela
tion to the threatened strike on east
ern railroads showed a disposition to
"stand pat" on his proposal for an
eight-hour day. 'This is a fair and
proper prosal, "lie said," and I believe
the public lias a right to expect its
acceptance.
Washington, Aug. 18. President
Wilson's plan for settlement of the
threatened nation-wide rialroad strike
was accepted today by the reprcsenta
thus of the employes and taken un
der consideration by the officials of
the tallroads with many indications
that they would reject it tomorrow.
The world came from the managers to
ngihi, however, that they had reached
no definite decision.
With the situation thus apparently
at a deadlock the only hope in the
situation lay in reports that the rnil
road officials might suggest a counter
proposal forming the basis of a set
clement or that one side or the other
might recede from its present posi
tion. Thirty-one presidents an d ranking
officials of the great railroads receiv
ed from the president this aftaniOOB
his plan for the adoption of an eight
hour day, regular pro rata pay for
overtime and creation of a led' ral
commission to investigate collateral
issues. They told him they would
like to consider the question and
would report back tomorrow with ti?e
committee of managers which has
eben conducting negotiation!,
At the same time the general com
mltteo of t!40 representatives of the
employes were approving the presi
dent's plan by a large majority and
soon after the rail road ollicials left the
White House the four heads of the
railroad brotherhoods delivered to the
president a letter notifying him of
the vote. Tho employes committee
will remain here at the president's
call.
While the railroad officials would
make no lormal statement they re
vealed clearing their opposition to Mr
Wilson's plan and Indicated that they
would press further their offer to ar
bltrato all (lie points at issue.
Ill spite of these developments it
was reported the officials might Bug
gest a counter proposal based on the
acceptance of the eight-hour day and
arbitration of all other points instead
of the Investigation b a federal com
mission proposed under the president's
plan. It was slateil positively, now
ever, that the ollicials had readied no
definite decision on tlioir future
course.

FISHERMEN AND HUNTERS
Letter to Them From CommiBtioner
J. W. Titcomb.
To the Licensed Anglers and Hunt
ers: Every one of you is interested
to have lishing and hunting improved,
at least so far as it pertains to your
favorite sport. It is safe to say that a
largo majority of you believe in con
servation and want the game laws en
forced; also that a large majority of
you believe in stocking the streams
and lakes with suitable species of
fish. Yet there is a great difference
of opinion about the laws for the pro
tection of lish and game as evidenced
by tho number of bills referred to the
Joint Committee on Game and Fisher
ies at each recurring term of the Leg
islature. During the Legislature of
1910, one hundred bills were referred
to the Joint Committee on Game and
Fisheries.
To attempt to explain the frequent
efforts to change certain parts of the
C&apter of game laws is unnecessary.
You have only to call together at the
comer grocery or elsewhere a half
dozen persons more or less, and dis
cuss any one or all sections. A few-
would abolish the entire chapter, bar
ring perhaps the sections relating to
song and Insectivorous birds. These
few are mostly men who neither lish
nor hunt. A majority of the few are
adversely effected by some one of tlie
laws or think they are. Some of them
are men who do not like to be under
restraint while In the woods. Another
group will disagree upon the varying
opening seasons on both fish and
game. It will be difficult to find any
two men in a group who will agree up
on all of the open seasons either as to
the time of opening or of closing them.
Quite a number ol people In one por
tion of the state would advocate fish
ing with nets, but would split on the
kinds of nets, while in most parts of
the state such a course is regarded as
uicfdal. Some men who are opposed
to the barbarous method of taking
deer known as "crusting" believe that
it is perfectly proper for them to have
June or July venison. Among the
"real sportsmen" are faddists who
cause the State much expense In at
tempts through their representatives
to convert the majority of the legisla
ture to their ideas. The writer has In
mind one such who would abolish the
Commissioner because the latter does
not attempt to remove all protection
from coons and this man would discon
tinue the stocking of streams with
fish so long as coons are protected.
I have briefly reviewed some of the
many differences ol opinion on a sub
ject of great economic Importance,
not for the purpose of starting discus
sions or suggestions for further legis
lation. but rather in the hopes that an
explanation of the reasons for the
laws and the policy of the Commls
sloner in reference to their execution,
may tend to a .more general under
standing and mere cordial co-opera
Hon on the part of those most vitally
interested.
Fish and game are property of the
state. The game laws have for their
basis the fundamental law that ani
mals ferae naturae are property of
the State, in other words, the State
owns all wild birds, wild quadrupeds
and fishes and may prescribe laws reg
ulating the periods of time and the
methods by which they may be taken.
Restrictive laws indispensable. All
will agree that, without restrictive
laws, our wild life would be extermin
I ted, Some quadrupeds and birds in
digenous t Vermont have already
been exterminated and in one Inst.tin e
an exterminated quadruped (the
deer) has been restored In such alum
dam e as to cause many discussions
as to what shall be our future policy
in regard to it.
When tho Indians Inhabited this
country they were by necessity con
servationists because they were large
ly dependent upon fish, game and fur
bearing animals for food and clothing,
With tlie progress in civilization and
Increase In population, the necessity
for restrictive and regulative laws has
become very generally recognized.
When a number of men form a pri

Why should not the nnglers and
hunters of the state who are paving
for the propagation and protection of
tlsli and game consider themselves om
large club and all agree to abide by
the rules prescribed by the majority
of the members through their ropn
sentiitlvos In the Legislature?
I now ask your Indulgence while
give some of the reasons for some of
the more important laws.
Angling is defined to limit a person
tn one rod and line when fishing from
tin- shore and two puis ain! iiiii" iii
two lines when flshitiR from a boat
being assumed that In either case tin
one or two lines is all Hint a person
inn properly tend. The ciimpi r on tin
shore of a pond some times would
like to set a line with a hundred
hooks, more or loss, or to keep one
line set in front of his cottage night
and day. Such a practice In Itself
would not tie nei evsarllv deslrucllv
but other campers want the same prlv
nege; qaiiy visitors want the saint
privilege and thus If such a prnetli
were permitted the draft upon tlie re
sources of the pond would be such as
to ruin the fishing. On Lake Ch un
tilnln u n.irnl It il f..,' ,.,.,, hum
. ,..".. ". ,.,, -. ...,, tf ' lll'll ,1 ,
I wont to take fish by means of selues
from 20 to 40 rods in length and some
would like to continue to do it. The
elimination of this method has result
ed in giving better hook and line fish
ing to the public generally. Many of
the men who were formerly employed
In hauling seines now make equal or
better wages fishing or guiding fisher
men. A comparatively few owners of
seining grounds are the only ones ad
versely affected.
Close Seasons. Tlie close seasons
on fish are made first with reference
to their spawning habits and second
with a view to conservation. Some
species spawn in the springtime on a
rising temperature; other species
spawn In autumn on a falling temper
ature. The actual time of spawning
is regulated by the temperature of
the water. For illustration, brook
trout, lake trout and landlocked sal
mon spawn in October and November
and begin their nuptial journey in
August and September and in some
waters even earlier. Iilack bass spawn
the latter part of May or in June and
the male protects the nest of eggs un
til hatched and for a week or two
thereafter until the fry scatter for
food. In cold water lakes the func
tion is not complete before July 1st.
The remoal of a bass from the spawn
ing beds ordinarily menas the loss of
from 3,000 to 8,000 eggs or young fry.
Pike perch spawn in March or
April according to the season when
the ice goes out. Pickerel usually
spawn during the month of April and
this is the only month when protec
tion is afforded them.
About twenty-five years ago the late
Rowland K Robinson called my atten
tion to tlie need of some protection for
"bull heads" during tlie spawning sea
son. Such a proposal to the Legisla
ture of that day would have been
scoffed at and the newspapers would
have Included it in their lines of Jokes,
many of which are well merited by
some of tho proposed game bills. The
bull head, or horn pout, (a member of
the cattish family) makes a hole In a
mud bank In which to spawn and after
the spawning function remains to pro
tect the eg:s and young. At such
times the lish are easily captured and
the capture of one bull head from Its
nest may mean the destruction of sev
eral thousand young. To (ire vent such
wholesale capture during the spawn
ing period the last Legislature enact
ed a law ot prohibit the sale of tills
valuable fish from May 15 to June 30.
Size limit. The six inch law on
brook trout, the ten inch law on black
bass, steelhead trout and pike perr
the twelve Inch law on pickerel, lake
trout ami landlocked salmon are all
designed to give the fish an oppottun
Ity to grow sufficiently mature to re
produce once before being killed.
There are rare instances in cold moun
tain streams where the brook trout
produces a lew eggs before reaching
six inches hut such Instances are so
rare that they make no argument for
reducing the limit, and the number
and condition of eggs produced bv
such undersized fish Is negllble. Tin
opponents ot the six inch law argue
that fish die when hooked. This mav
lie true when the angler In a temper
roughly tears the fish from the hook.
but if the angler Is anxious to save the
fish for another year's sport and wet
his hand before gently removing it he
will not lose more than one In om
hundred. The removal at the "slimv"
rotective coating by grasping the fish
with the dry hand is far more do-
tractive than tearing out the eye or
piece of the nose.
The arguments for the six inch law
on trout are equally applicable to tlx
limits on the species of larger growth
about which there Is little If any com
plaint and in reference to which thi
laws are seldom violated. In fuct
with refen-nce to lake trout and land
locseii salmon there Is a demand to
have the limit increased from twelve
Inches to fifteen Indies, It being very
lonbtfnl if either species reproduce
until they have attained the larger
lie. These limit laws arc not pecul
inr to Vermont, although some states
put the limit on trout at live Inches
which means that in a much fished
stream stoiklng with artificially
hatched trout must be depended upon
to keep up tlie supply. Hut what fun

as follows:
One of the "charges" of the Fletcher
bureau has been that Senator I'ugo's
vocational bill was a lizzie ami was
lost In the shuffle. Can it be poealblt
that the Associated Press Is in league
with "the Interests" to defeat Allen

Melville K. Stone, genrral manager of

and promptly acquit us in the matter."
This we do cheerfully, and deslro
to make as public us possible the fact
we were In en or In crediting the dis
patch to the Associated Press. Yer
