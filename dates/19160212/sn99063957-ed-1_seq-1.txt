Austro-German Declaration That Armed Mercknen Will
Be Torpedoed Without Warning Raises Another Intri
' cate Diplomatic Question Allies Fear America May
Modify Her Views As To Shipment of Munitions-Will
Protest Claiming Act Is Unneutral
Washington, Feb. 12. With the possible arrival today
of the Austro-German notices of intent to torpedo armed
merchantmen without warning, the American govern
ment faced one of the most serious and intricate diplo
matic questions since the war started. Indications are
that Secretary of State Lansing will admit the soundness
of the foundation on which the Teutons have built their
contention that arming merchantmen makes the usual
visit and search impossible before attack by submarines.
Such agreement with the Teuton notes would be followed
by a warning to Americans not to travel on armed allied
merchant ships.
Meanwhile allied diplomats are beginning to feel that
if the United States acquiesces in a change of rules con
cerning armament, while the war is in progress, it would
be only a short step to a change of view that would result
in placing an embargo on munitions traffic. The United
States has held such trade legal and neutral, but the
allies suggest that a modification of the submarine policy
may forecast a modification of the munitions policy, too.
A government official admitted today he is considering
the possibility that the allies ship lines would boycott
American goods billed for other ports than their own,
but he believes that such a boycott could be fought suc

El I'aso, Texas, Feb. 12. Two cattle
thieves will be dragged to the Juarez
cemetery today, while C'arranz.i auth

the execution of Sergeant ftojas and
Civilian Sanchez, convicted of stealing
and selling ammunition.
The officials arranged that the
thieves siioud think th.t they, too,
were going to their death.
"They will not be informed that
they are not to be killed," said Con
sul Gavira, "until after a firing squad
has disposed of the two condemned
men. W'e planned this as an object les
son, so they will not steal any more
cattle."

ward the Mormon colony at Casas
Grandes where 500 men, women and
children are, practically unprotected.
The rebel chief spent the night at La
Hacienda De La Candelari.i, 100 miles

English Say We Keep Out of
the War la Order to

FRENCH MORE POLITE
SO ONLY INTMATE IT
Both However Are Determ
ined to Fight Until Vic
tory Is Achieved
Washington, Feb. 12. An idea that
Germany's animosity toward the Unit
ed States because of our munition sales
to the allies will inversely assure us
the lasting friendship of the allies is
erroneous in the opinion of two Amer
ican newspaper men who are in a posi
tion to know.
Ed L. Keen, general European man
ager of the United Press with head
quarters in London, and William Phillii
Simms, manager of the Paris bureau of
the United Press back in this country
on short vacations, met here today
prior to their return to Europe. Thej
outstanding idea in the mind of each
after a few days of contact with the
American viewpoint was the extent to
which Americans ar deceiving them
selves on two points, namely the feel
ing of the people of France and Eng
land toward America, and the possibili
ties of an early peace.
English Opinion of Us.
(By Ed. L. Keen.)
(General European managerof the Uni
ted Press.)
It is evident thnt America misunder
stands England almost as much as Eng
land misunderstands America in this
war.
An American returning from England
for the first time since the war started,
cannot fail to be amazed at the lack
of appreciation among his fellow coun
trymen of the determination of the al
lies ami particularly that of England
to push the war relentlessly to a vic
torious conclusion at any cost and any
sacrifice. It's like the surprise of the
first-time traveler to Europe when he
finds that the people of the allied coun
tries are not overflowing with grntitude
for the material support given by the
American munitions makers.
It may be a shock to som folks on
this side to learn how prevalent
throughout the allied countries and es
pecially in England is the idea that
the only reason we are keeping out of
the war is that we can make more mon
ey by not coming in. It is not merely
the anti-American newspapers that la
bel us "dollar chasers." In official
circles a more sympathetic view is tak
en, but the public at large is convinced
Uncle Sam is prepared to swallow "any
insult to his honor" rather than re
linquish this unprecedented opportunity
of lining his pockets with European
gold. They don 't hate us exactly. The
feeling ranges rather from pity to con
tempt, according to the individual.
Such misapprehension of America's
attitude finds its parallel here.
Is Fight to a Finish.
"Aren't the allies about ready to
quit?" "Do they really think they
have a chance to win!" These ques
tions are asked in all quarters here.
Rumors have spread broadcast that one
or more of the allies arc seeking a sep
arate pence; that any of them would
be willing to listen now to terms lens

Washington, Feb. 12. President
Wilson will bring the name of Secre

him when he returns to Washington to

officials believed today. Although there
is a strong idea that a "dark horse"
will be chosen, it is known that when
he left last night, the president had
under foremost consideration for the
place, Secretary of Agriculture Houston
and Secretary of Interior Lane.
German-American opposition has de

much as he is of Canadian birth.
There is much talk that Major Gen

It is believed that the president has

Lane, Houston and a "dark horse."

American Border Fearing Raid From German-Amer-icans
Fighting Is Resumed Along Eastern Front
By Henry Wood
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
Rome, Feb. 12. The last gap in the allies' economic
boycott of the central powers was closed today by issu
ance of an Italian decree forbidding, under heavy penalty,
the importation of any Austro-German goods. This step
was announced after Premier Briand had held several
hours' conference with the foreign office.
"We have completed the steel wall around Germany,"
he said in discussing the embargo.
Ordinarily such a step would have provoked an im
mediate declaration of war, but it is not believed here
that Germany cares to enroll Italy among her open
enemies, both for financial and military reasons.
Briand said that the allies are determined to throttle,
the Teutons from an economic standpoint, while making
them suffer from a military standpoint.

Commissioner Marshal Ex
plains Its WorkingsA
Very Interesting Meeting
W. A. Marshall, of the stato indus
trial accident commission, delivered an
address last evening on "Compeufa
tion," at the Union hall, expluining iu
detail the workings of the compensa
tion act.
Injured workmen receive far more
liberal benefits through the workings)
of the Oregon law than through the
lawa of other states where the em
ployers insure through stock or mu
tual companies, according to the state
ment of Mr. Marshall. The expeiu
is much less through the workings f
tho Oregon law thnn that compared to
mutual or stock companies, and to sub
stantiate this statement, Mr. Marshall
noted the fact that H4 1,1)78 had been
paid in beucfits to injured workmen
during the past 19 months, or had been
laid aside for future payments, at an
administration eost of only 478,544.
An average of 8,ti00 accidents occur
every year in Oregon .and the Iossj in
actual wages nmounted to possibly $2,
(100,000, according to Mr. Marshall'a
figures. .
In reference to the money that was
paid and set aside as a reserve fund tn
bo paid in monthly payments to depend
ents in filial ciises, it was stated that
fully one-third of a million was invested
in Oregon municipal and school bonds.
Following Mr. Marshall s talk, an in
teresting address was made by B. V.
