'' part of the mine affected by the ex
plosion had been completed.
Because of the condition of the
j mine rescue work progressed slowly.
I A numb.T of rescuers were overcome
! by gr.s, the condition of one James
Mcuuire being serious.
One hundred volunteers, including
miners from various parts of the coun
ty, have entered the mine and are
working to reach the imprisoned men.
The explosion occurred in an entry
just off the main entry of the mine.
More thar 100 men were at work at
the time and thirty-seven of them
were trapn d by falling rocks and
debris.. The others escaped.
Abandon Hope.
Soon after the arrival of the bureau
of mines rescue car, a report spread
that three men were still alive in the
i mine and efforts tv-ere redoubled to
: reach the section where they are be
lieved to be imprisoned, but resulted
i in bringing to light another man who
had been killed. The workings ahead
of the rescue crew were found to be
filled with afterdamp and all hope of
i further rescue was abandoned, al-
; though the crew continued their work.

HE THAWED IT OUT
Topekans Thought Dynamite
Sticks Were Frozen.
As a Result Two Men Are Seri
ously Injured.
While trying to thaw out a stick of
dynamite Friday afternoon two fore
men on county road work. Thomas J.
Hurley and L. W. Thompson, were
badly injured. The dynamite explod
ed, shattering the bones on one of
Hurley's feet and blowing sand and
gravel into the face and eyes of
Thompson.
The men were working on the hill
just south of Fifteenth street and east
of the bridge over the Shunganunga.
Workmen were blasting on the hill
and the dynamite was frozen. A stick
was placed in a bucket of sand and
placed on or near a fire. The two
foremen superintended the job. A
spark from the fire fell in the bucket
and Hurley feared it would cause the
dynamite to explode. He turned the
bucket upside down with his foot and
held it down to smother the spark.
The spark or the Jar did the business
find the dynamite went off.
Hurley s foot was on the bucket at
the time of the explosion. The bones
in his foot were driven into the fleshy
part of the leg j.nd the leg itself was
badly injured. Thompson was a little
farther away from the blast but his
face and eyes were peppered with
gravel and small stones. Hurley may
lose his foot, but physicians who treat
ed him say that unless tetanus de
velops it is probable that the foot
can be saved.
Hurley has been on county road
work here for many years.

GOETHALS EXPOSES
CANAL ROBBERY
IT. S. Loses Millions In Settlement
of Zone Claims, Says
Ditch Builder.
Washington, Feb. 12. The liberal
ity of various joint land commissions
in settling claims for property taken
In the canal zone has robbed the
United States of millions of dollars.
General Gothals today told the house
interstate commerce committee in urg
ing the passage of the Adamson bill
to force the commission to settle for
lands on the basis of their value when
the treaty was entered Into with
Panama in 1903, rather than their in
creased value as has been the custom.
All of the land in the ten-mile strip
along the canal subject to claims
would not be worth more than $1,000,
000 as its 1903 value, the general said,
but it is likely to cost $17,000,000 or
$18,000,000 at the rates which have
been paid.
"The joint land commission, we
have had several of them, have taken
the ground that as we are a big re
public and they are rather poor, we
should pay liberally for their lands,"
the general said. "As a consequence
the values have exceeded very much
those of 1903 and as time goes on land
seems to get more and more valuable.
Private agreements that were made
for the sale of land to us are abro
gated and the owners go to the joint
land commission and they get addi
tional funds from it.
"The situation now is rather acute.
"It is rather hard to stay there and
see our government robbed the way it
has been in the past."

Berlin, Feb. 12. By wireless to Say

public today to the Overseas News
agency:
"The letter which Cardinal Mercier

GOLD WAVE ON THE WAY
The Storm Is Not Expected to Be a
Severe One.
A "baby" cold wave is the prospect
for tonight according to the weather
bureau. A minimum temperature of
between 10 and 15 degrees is the pre
diction for Topeka with continued
cold weather Sunday. The snow $
all gone but the ice remains in a few
places. Reports to the weather bureau
indicate that the wheat is safe, said S.
D. Flora, local observer this morning.
The wind is in the north, blowing at
the rate of 24 miles an hour. This Is
responsible for the sudden change of
weather.
The forecast calls for unsettled
weathet and much colder tonight:
partly cloudy and moderately cold
Sunday. The shippers forecast says
to protect 36-hour shipments north
and wes. against temperatures of 10
degres; east and south, 15 degrees and
upward.
The mercury fell slowly last night,
passing the freezing point at mid
night. At 10 o'clock this morning
it had reached 24 degrees and was
still on the decline. The drop prom
ised to be steady all day today and
tonight. There is a possibility of a
few snow flurries tonight, but nothing
in the way of a storm is predicted.
The high wind is expected to con
tinue tonight and part of Sunday.
On February 12, 1899, the lowest
temperature ever recorded in Topeka
occurred. The minimum on that day
was 25 degrees below zero, which has
never been equalled since the local
records have been kept. The high rec
ord if 60 degrees, established on this
date in 1907. '
The mercury dropped slowly today,

Abraham Lanculu, sixteenth president of the United States, born February
12, 1S09.
WATTERSON OX LIXCOLX.
Born as lowly as the Son of God, In a hovel; reared in penury, squalor,
with no gleam of light or fair surroundings, without . graces, actual- or ac
quired; without name or fame or official training; it wafe reserved for this
Btrange being, late in life, to be snatched from obscuritv, raised to su
preme command at a supreme moment, and entrusted with tj destiny of
a. nation '
The great leaders of his party, the . most experienced and accomplished
public men of the day, were made to stand aside, were sent to the rear,
while this fantastic figure was led by unseen hands to the front and given
the reigns of power. It is immaterial whether we were for 'him or against
him, wholly immaterial. Thaw during four years, carrying with them
such a weight of responsibility as the world never witnessed before, he,
filled the vast space allotted to him in the eyes and actions of mankind, is
to say that he was inspired of God, for nowhere else could he have ac-'
quired the wisdom and the virtue.
Where did Shakespeare get his genius? Where did Mozart get his
music? Whose hand smote the lyre of the Scottish ploughman, and stayed
the life of the German priest? God, God and God alone; and as surely as
these were raised up by God, inspired by God, was Abraham Lincoln; and
a thousand years hence, no drama, no tragedy, no epic poem will be filled
with greater wonder, or be followed by mankind with deeper feeling than
that which tells the story of his life and death. Peroration of address be

Six Weeks.
Xew York. Feb. 12. Colonel
Roosevelt set sail for the West Indies
without saying a word about the res
ignation of Secretary Garrison, with
whom he recently engaged in a bat
tle of letters.
"Whatever I thin.k about Mr. Gar
rison, his rmiicies. the international
questions, the Lusitania and national
preparedness you will find in my new
book, published yesterday," said the
colonel to reporters who met him on
board the Quebec liner Cuiana. "I
have nothing else to say.'
But the colonel did have something
to say to a reporter who inquired if
he intendeo "to do a little hunting in
the West Indies?"
A Koolteh Question.
"Now, that's & foolish question,"
snapped the colonel, transfixing the re
porter with a scornful glance. "You
don't go whaling in the Rockies, do
you? Then why try hunting in the
West Indies?"
Thirteen-year-old Marjorie Sparrett,
whose battleship fund drew $1 from
the colonel for his grandchildren and
a letter of approval, rushed down the
pier and was introduced.
"Three cheers for you, Marjorie,
from my four grandchildren." He
added, "I am delighted to see you. I
jwant you to understand that battle

We need battleships to protect grand

The colonel volunteered a brief
comment or. the Lusitania question.
"If a man s wife is slapped in the
face by some other man and he does
nothing about it for nine months, then
it is of no consequence what he does
after that." ht said, pounding the air
with his clenched fist.
The colonel eaid his jaunt to the
West Indies will last five or six weeks
and will be strictly a pleasure trip.

sion may result in the closing of the
oil inspection department.
In a decision holding the oil inspec.
tion fee act unconstitutional, the court
stated that the fees of ten cents a bar
rel now charged by the state are ex
cessive and that the sum constitutes a
revenue rather than an inspection
measure. The original law. giving to
the state the right to inspect oil, is
upheld by the court. In other words,
the state may continue to inspect oil.
But the work will be done at a loss
to the state. An appropriation for thw
department by the 1915 legislature is
now available, but there is doubt as
to the future of the department since,
the revenue has been removed.
Must Return Fees.
Under the court's order today, the
stare is directed to return $123,789.04
in fees now held by Earl Akers. statu
treasurer. These fees were paid by
the oil companies under protest, pend
ing final action in the suit to declare
the law unconstitutional.
The legislature of 1905 passed the
law providing for an inspection fee of
ten cents a barrel. In the last few
years the heavy use of oil and gasoline
has produced a heavy return to the
state. In 1914, the state realized
more than $60,000 from the depart
ment after paying all expenses. Last
year the lovenues of the department
amounted to nearly $10,900 a month.
Not only must the state return the
money collected since the suit was be
gun, but it must lose all revenues un
til the legislature can enact a new law.
Upsetting of the oil inspection
measure today was due to the action
of Governor Capper in vetoing an
amendment to the old law. The leg.
islature of 1915 provided that lie
fees for inspection of oil and gasolins
should be reduced from ten cents to
three cents a barrel. This sum, it mi
urged, would meet the expenses of
the department. Both houses passed
the bill, but it was vetoed by the gov
ernor and the oil companies took their
troubles to the courts. In the fight
to win a whole loaf or nothing, tho
state today received nothing. It mut
now maintain the inspection depart
ment at the expense of the taxpayers
or close shop.
S. M. Brewster, attorney general,
stated this afternoon that the state
may be compelled to maintain the in
spection department from appropria
tions. In this event, the states makes
free inspections of oil at refineries.
Van Sickle to Prison.
William H. VanSickle, the OIpe real
estate man, must go to prison tar
crimes against sixteen -yoar-old Alma
Stevenson. The supreme court to
day affirmed the decision of the
Shawnee county district court and re
fused to give the Lyon county man
new trial.
The case was taken to the supreme
court on the grounds that the state in
its case In chief failed to show that
VanSickle and the Stevenson girl were
not husband and wife. In its de
cision the court held that it was not
necessary for the state to anticipate
tho policy of the defense and that the
court did not commit error in refusing'
a special instruction on the marriags
clause. Evidence indicated clearly,
the supreme court said, that Van
Sickle and the girl were not married.
Unless the defense had directly
pleaded a marriage relation, the state
was not bound to meet such an issue.
VanSickle 1b a married man and the
father of several children. His in
fatuation for the little country girl,

was arrested on a criminal charge and
convicted. Because of the wide ac
quaintance of the families in Lyon
county, the caps attracted wide atten

Luther C. Bailey today lost his fight
before the supreme court for a writ
of quo warranto against Topeka city
commissioners, when the court held
that the city acted within its rights
in granting concession rights and priv
ileges at Gage park. Action on the
part of the city, the court held, did not
destroy the spirit of the deed convey

When the city In 1915 sold conces
