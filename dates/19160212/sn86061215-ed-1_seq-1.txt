GARRISON OUT
OF CABINET TO

Continental Army Plan Is
Bone of Contention on

WAR SECRETARY IS
CHAMPION OF BILL
President Finds Sentiment
Is More Favorable to
Enlarging Guards
Washington, D. C., Feb. 11. Secre
tary Garrison has resigned from the
cabinet because President Wilson de
clined to insist without compromise on
the adoption of the continental army
plan by congress. The resignation was
tendered and accepted yesterday, and
with Mr. Garrison, the assistant secre
tary of war, Henry C. Breckinridge,
left the service of the government.
The president finds himself today
personally in charge of the administra
tion's plans for strengthening the
army and working out a definite mili
tary policy. He has not selected a suc
cessor to Mr. Garrison and it is regard
ed as' probable that even after the new
head of the war department is named,
the president will continue to handle
The reasons for Secretary Garrison's
resignation and its acceptance by the
president are disclosed In lengthy cor
respondence made public
them. The correspondence
Clarke's amendment to the Philippine
bill, was an important factor. The
secretary characterized the amend
ment as "an abandonment of the duty
of this nation and a breach of trust
for the Filipinos."
Against National Guard.
Secretary Garrison contended that
only a federal continental army, in
stead of a recognized national guard,
could be the main military dependence
of the country, while the president
contended that no one plan could be
enforced on congress.
two contentions that the break be
tween the president and his secretary
of war came.
Assistant Secretary Breckinridge,
who shared Mr. Garrison's views, re
signed because of loyalty to his chief.
Maj. Gen. Scott, chief of staff of the
army, automatically became secretary
of war ad interim.
Lane to 8uceeed?
While Secretary Lane was being
considered in official circles as a
likely choice, It was understood that
the president has under qonsideration
the names of two or three other men.
The president has already made up
his mind to appoint a democrat, and it
was said that he will not be frtm New
Jersey nor from the south.
Former Gov. Walsh of Massachu
setts, Secretary Houston, Former Gov.
Harmon of Ohio and Former Mayor
Baker of Cleveland were added to-the
names being discussed. Former Gov.
Adams of Colorado was being talked
of as a possible successor to Secre
tary Lane. It was understood, how
ever, thpt at least one of the men
being considered by the president has
not been mentioned publicly for the
position of secretary of war.
The cabinet met today with a va
cant chair for the first time since Mr.
Bryan's resignation. The departure
of Mr. Garrison, with Its possible ef
fects on the administration and the
preparedness program, was discussed
thoroughly.
Report that there might be other
resignations from the cabinet were
met with denials.
Work to Proceed.
"Congress will proceed to comple
tion of a military program without re
gard to the resignation of Secretary
Garrison," said Chairman Chamber
lain of the senate' military affairs com
mittee today after a meeting of the
committee. "The resignation will
have no effect on the military com
mittees of the senate or the house.
"Personally, I regret his resignation.
Mr. Garrison was a forceful man and
one of positive views which he was
not afraid to stand by. Unfortunately
Ills continental army plan was not
popular in the military committees' of
congress, nor did it meet with the
views of a majority of the members
in the senate and the house."

DECISION TO REGARD ARMED
MERCHANTMEN AS WARSHIPS
HELD JUSTIFIABLE.
Berlin, Feb. 11. —The Germania.
commenting on the German govern
ment's announcement that it intends
to treat armed merchantmen as war
ships, declares that it places England
in a pillory before the world, and con
tinues:
"The manner in which England has
been unmasked by the publication of
the German memorandum is more
Btrtking than anything else hitherto
made known. The British method of
warfare has been exposed as dissimu
lating. as treacherous to her enemies
and to neutrals."
The Germania asserts the course de

Inescapable duty. Responsibility for
new developments, it contends, will
rest on the British government alone.

correspondent as follows
"On the afternoon of February 9,

AFRICAN MONKEYS.
New York, Feb. 11.—Prof. Richard
L. Garner, who several years ago made
a study of the language of the apes in
the African forests, will soon again
take up his temporary residence in a
steel cage in the French Congo region
to resume his scientific studies of the
gorrila and chimpanzee.
Prof. Garner plans to leave New
York within two weeks for the Congo
in behalf of the Smithsonian institu
tion and New York Zoological society.
He will attempt to increase his vocabu
lary of words used by the apes and
will carry phonograph records to rec
ord the languages of monkeys.
The' scientist will construct a cage
of steel rods, enclosed by a netting of
steel wire. The cage will be covered
with branches and leaves and Prof.
Gardner will live in It while pursuing
his studies. He will be armed with
rifle and revolvers and ammonia sport
gun to discharge over-inquisitive
prowlers, and three moving picture
cameras. By food calls and scents he
hopes to lure gorrillas into his cage
and capture them.

London, Feb. 11. Latest re
ports show no signs of a lessening
In the intensity of the struggle
which has been going on In the
vicinity of Vlmy and Neuville,
near the Belgian border. The re
pulse of frequent French attacks
Is reported by the Germans.
In Belgium, according to unof
ficial reports, there has been a not
able artillery battle during the last
ten days near Ypres, but the
opinion appears to prevail that the
Germans have decided to postpone
their predicted offensive until
mere favorable weather prevails.
In Volhynia the Russians report
a forward movement In the cap
ture of a hill between the fort
resses of Rovno and Lutsk, but the
latest Austrian reports claim that
the Russians have been held to
their old positions In Galicla and
on the Bessarabian frontier.
Somewhere in the North Sea (via
London), Feb. 11.—Great Britain's
first line offensive fleet, an incompar
able combination of speed and gun
power ready for instant use, was in
spected yesterday by a party of
French and American correspondents
and a representative of the Associated
Press was permitted to view from
the bridge of a torpedo boat the naval
unit which is expected to meet the
first shock of a German attack.
In the fleet were virtually all the
veteran fighting craft which have been
in action in this war, but they show
ed few scars with the exception of an
occasional dent in their armor. The
places of honor were held by battle
cruisers which in engagements from
the Falkland isles to the Dardanelles
have borne the brunt of the sea fight
ing.
Unpopular with officers and men be
fore the war because they were con
stantly coaling, and never more than
cautiously praised by the proponents
of the superdreadnaught policy, these
huge fighting machines hold the pre
mier position in the British navy, in
which warship speed is now regarded
as the important principle of naval
strategy.
As the launch with the correspond
ents on board turned toward the line
of battle cruisers against the horizon,
they could see the "eyes" of the fleet,
in the form of a few prowling destroy
ers which keep up incessant watch,
not only to protect their mighty sis
ters from submarine attack, but to
catch the first view of any German
warship which might poke its nose
Into the open North sea.
Huge Ships In Fleet.
Looming through the mists could
be seen the giant tripod masts which
identified the fleet as including the
very latest type of battle cruisers, and
soon the launch was at the foot of a
huge battle cruiser which got its bap
tism of fire at Helgoland Bight and
later bore an honorable share in the
Dogger bank action. Before the lunch,
visitors were permitted to enter any
portion of the ship they chose.
The party lunched as guests of the
divisional rear admiral, and then
were taken on board the famous
cruiser Lion which was Admiral
Beatty's flagship in the Dogger bank
battle. With the exception of a dent
in her forward turret armor and a sim
ilar scar Just above the water line,
this show vessel of the British navy
displays little sign of the terrific ham
mering she got when three German
battle cruisers concentrated their fire
on her.
Carefully mounted in the company
ionway is an eleven Inch unexploded
shell which the Seydlitz hurled
through the Lion'B armor below the
waterline.
No evidence has ever been found
to justify the story that the Lion was
torpedoed.
Men Scatter in Battle.
No sign was left of the twelve inch
shell which blew in the bulkhead of
the admiral's quarters after going
through the deck, except the casing
and cap occupying the place of honor
among the Lion's trophies.
The officers explained that the rea
son there were so few casualties was
due to the fact that the men were so
scattered about the ship during the
action that an exploding shell was
not likely to kill more than one or two
at a time.

EIGHTY TWO STUDENTS FAIL TO
SHOW PROMISE OF BECOMING
GOOD OFFICERS.
Washington, D. C., Feb. 11.—Secre
tary Daniels today approved the
recommendations of the academic
board at the naval academy dismiss
ing eighty-two midshipmen for failure
in their studies.
Their names may be made public
later.
Of those dismissed three are of the
first class, nineteen of the second,
twenty of the third and forty of the
fourth class. In announcing his de
cision, Secretary Daniels said that
while the navy needed more officers
only those who could meet the high
standards and qualify by examination
could be retained.
"To meet this need," he said, "the
sixty-third congress, on the recom
mendation of the navy department,
continued the law which expired pro
viding for the appointment of two mid
shipmen by each member of congress
and the sixty-fourth congress, as the
first act in larger preparedness, has
passed the bill giving three appoint
ments to each senator and representa
tive. This makes possible an increase
of 531 midshipmen for the coming
year."
The secretary expressed regret that
the eighty-two students had been
found "unsatisfactory in euch a
degree
as does not justify the hope of their
graduation and training as officers In
the navy."

MIES APPEAL
TO CITIZENS
Membership Committee of
Commercial Club Asks
for Cooperation
EXPLAIN OBJECTS
OF ASSOCIATION
Need for All Ottumwans to
Assist in Organization
Given in Letter
The membership committee of the
Commercial association that has for
some weeks past been engaged in pre
paration for a campaign to Increase
the size and usefulness of the organ
ization has issued a statement setting
forth the objects and value of a com
munity association in Ottumwa. The
committee has mapped out a campaign
to get more members and expand the
work and value of the present organi
zation to the end that it will be more
effective In accomplishing Its objects
and making Ottumwa truly the Mag
net City. The statement follows:
"Why Is
a
Commercial association
needed here at all?" This is a ques
tion sometimes asked by the man "who
has perhaps not given the matter very
much consideration.
The question may be answered by
asking Yankee fashion, another ques
tion: "Why is the city needed? Why
did you decide to looate your business
here instead of a cow pasture The
answer Is obvious: To do business
with people you hare to go where the
people are. The kind or people who
will patronize the kind of business you
conduct. If you are a retailer, you
need customers If a lawyer, clients
if a doctor, patients if a manufacturer
labor if a wholesaler or Jobber,
enough Btable, reliable retailers with
whom to do enough business to make
It pay. No matter what your business,
you pavist.haye people to dq business
With, and the greater the amount of
public spirit and cooperation among
the-e people, the greater will be your
business.
Business and Local Sentiment.
Business is largely a matter of senti
ment, that is as far as the local condi
tions are concerned. Sentiment Is a
matter that must be created. Create
the right kind of sentiment concerning
your local institutions and the right
kind of business will follow. Stick
pin here so that you will not forget it
Then again, you needed friends, en?
tertainment, a church, library,
To Get or to Give?
a
school for your children, if you have
any means of contact with the out
side world. All this is simply anoth
er way of saying that you needed the
cooperation of other human beings in
order to promote your own welfare.
The commercial association or cham
ber of commerce is the latest, highest
and most effectual development of this
cooperative principle.
Your Prosperity and Ottumwa's.
Now note this: As you maintain
your life Itself largely through the
city in which you live, your prosperity
is largely dependent on the city's wel
fare. You know of many ways in
which this welfare could be promoted.
A spirit of greater confidence in the
city, willingness to work unselfishly
for its best interest, and a love of pro
gress among the citizenship would in
themselves accomplish wonders. Faith
and love precede work commercially
as well as religiously. There is no
monopoly of principles held by any
set of individuals. The same rule ap
plies in every walk of life. These
things in city building and commer
cial affairs can only be brought about
through the combined action of a num
ber of men—through commercial or
community association. You can call
to mind many advantages that the city
needs and which could readily be se
cured" if the people would only get
together." This is precisely what a
commercial association of the right
sort accomplishes. It brings the peo
ple together. It brings together the
community's natural leaders, the men,
and women who are Interested in the
community's advancement along all
lines and organizes them into an ef
ficient working machine.
One other thought: The really great
need for a commercial association is
not the opportunity it offers you to
get more from the community. It is
the chance it presents for giving more
to it. Have you ever considered how
great is the debt you owe the city in
which you live? That city is produc
ing or is the means of bringing to you
practically everything that makes life
worth living. This is a tremendous
service. Forget the idea if you ever
held it that the city cannot get along
without you the truth Is, you cannot
get along without the city. You owe
the city for all you have, or at any
rate, you owe the people with whom
you do business something more than
a mere exchange of values for the
prosperity you enjoy. You pay these
debts in part, by at least working with
other public spirited citizens for the
best interests of the city. A commer
cial association provides for the best
way of putting you in touch with such
men, without regard to creed, class or
politics.

0. S. OLDS WAR
AT ARM'S LENGTH
SAYS PRESIDENT
DELEGATES AT GREAT COM­
MERCE MEETING ARE TOLD OF
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Washington, D. C., Feb. 11.—Dele
gates to the annual convention of the
Chamber of Commerce of the United
States left for their homes today carry
ing with them a message from Presi
dent Wilson, the outstanding feature
of which was hin determination to
keep the United States out of the
European conflict, although he declar
ed that the nation merely held that
trouble at arm's length.
The president was speaking on neu
trality at the annual banquet of the
chamber which was a concluding fea
ture of a three days' convention. The
president also spoke of the need of a
real scientific tariff board and a mer
chant marine.
"It is a cruel thing," said the presi
dent, "to have it supposed, as it is
in many quarters, that we have kept
out of this war simply because we
wanted to keep out of trouble and sim
ply because we wanted to profit by the
trouble of others. I am not afraid of
the slow verdict of history with regard
to the neutrality of the United States,
and I believe that we are justified in
exercising every degree of patience in
making It clear what our position is
and how sincerely we are determined
not to allow this quarrel to become
part of ours.
"I have only this to say, though. We
hold this trouble at arm's length and
keep or attempt to keep our own
judgments cool, but the rest of the
world is hot and It may be that any
time without our cooperation and
without our ability to stop it the flame
may extend to us. And therefore, I
am glad that the United States has
been put In a position to mobilize its
financial resources and to get into
the position which it must at last get
Into, whether it wants to or not.
"If only we can keep this great
nation at peace there is an infinite
prospeot of happy prosperity before
the United States, not because others
have suffered, but because the United
States is ready to help, because the
United States is ready to serve."
