The contested election case of
Koepp vs. Crawford filled the court
rqom, last Monday- snd Tuesday,
with an audience that eqwded each'
other in an efort to hear the- teetl
mony, brought them to their feet
in an endeavor to see the faces of
witnesses, and finally to stand 04
seats and to crush about the iling,
tLhat separated them from members
of the bar, until the Court ogdered
,Othem back. It was but a few meo
ments, however, when they. were
Sagain on their feet, as the -Wliteses
told the story of their pa.t in an
"election with processes of tabulation
i as crde as in a frontier mining
town of '49. Brat Harte. might have
told it and made it interesting. The
counting of votes by torchlight, the
early breakfast and the ifisahing up
In a room in a boarding house in
Covington and the final depositing
of the boxes in an open vaUlt, .boXes
barely sealed and seals broken.
The audience was not simply com
posed of idle on-lookers. - There
i were those present who tremnbled in
I,.tear that they were violators of the
- law, and that before the case was
ever some testimony might be given
that would implicate them.- There
had been mutterings that thea elec
tion generally had had revolting feah
tures and that the people were; over
tried, disgusted and in a temper to
.grasp opportunities for prosecption.
But withal there was a streak of
humor that crept into the proceed
ings occasionally, to draw the mind
from the contemp ption of the inet
Acency that marked the whole pro
? -seeding of balloet.4untf g. 1t~ wat
humorous to hear of a watcher peer
ing over the shoulder of a commiis
stoner who was reading off the bel
lots by the flickering light of a pine
knot rte and whose nose must have
been very near the ticket to read
it himself, and to afterwards hear
testimony that errors in the tally
Ssheet were due to lack of practice
in writing. It was humorous to hear
that the only tally sheet that had
.been given to the clerk of court as
returns was a spoilt tally sheet that
had been given to witness by one of
the commissioners; who said he had
no use for it; that he could keep it if
he wanted It; and it was humor
oes to see the surprise and conster
nation of defendant's counsel, when
a witness who was to have been
shown as an illegal voter who voted
for Koepp, and who acknowledged
on the stand that he lived in the
third ward and voted in the second
say, that notwithstanding he hid
told defendant's counsel he voted for
..Koepp, he in reality had voted for
SCrawford. It was humorous to hear
witness testify that he could not read
or write, but that he was positive he
had voted for Koepp, and his conti
dence was well supported when he
further testified that his ticket had
been made out by Tony Koepp. It
was humorous to hear a witness tes
tify that he had voted for Koepp,
.and that he had ridden to poll in a
Planche car. These things brought
,amiles that softened the inward re
r bellion at conditions that the people
Sbavre resolved to correct.
Judge Robt. Ried, of Amite City,
.Harvey E. Ellis and Judge T. M.
BurniK sat in the defendant's corner.
-Judge Ried handled defendant's
case, and he handled it well. B. M,
Miller, A. L. Bear and L. C. Moise
were with the plaintiff. It was in
teresting to watch the battle between
'Miller and Rled. They were the two
who foughth in .the aren. a,nd it.W
a very nicely fought battle; keen
alertness against keen alertness;
legal knowledge against legal knowl
edge. 'Miller won most of the ,rul
ings of the Court,. Bled always tak
ing exceptions. When the fight
against recounting of the ballots was
lost by Ried, it could be seen that
he had given up hope of victory and
was preparing to make nother40t
in the Supreme Court.
Throughout,. the case was sonduct
ed with the cleanest good humor.
While every legal advantage was tak'
en by counsel on both sides, ,there
were no bitter or unpleasant inter
change or passes, and comment and
argument never reached a strident
or unusual tone. Both plalntift.Dd
defendant expressed themselves as.
desirous of nothing more than t
fair count. Neither wanted the 9t
flece of assessor unless it had been
honestly won by them, but soca
thought that a. fair count would give
it to him.
Judge Lancaster made his rulings
promptly and showed his familiari
ty with the election eases and pre
cedents. He had just passed throu.gh
a strenuous court week, and was to
leave for New Orleans Wednesday
morning to consult his physician, but
he not only held out welt-dnrIUnt4.

Mr. Bradley in courthouse Sunday.
He was in the office a. few minutes
in the forenoon.
.By the Court:
It seems to me that the cross ex
amination is very strenuous, unless
you have some definite proof that
this box had been tampered with.
Jdlge Bled:
It is not up to us to prove it has
been tampered with.
The Court:
-that is the position the Court
takes.
Judge Rled:
If your honor please, the Supreme
Court, in the Marrero-Middleton
ase, which is the leading case on
that subject, says that if there has
been any opportunity given to tam
per, there does not necesparily have
to be proof that it has been tam
e with; but that if it has been
ao kept, or if an opportunity has
been given, so that it might have
been tampered with, without it bein
tampered with, it can not be opened.
Mr. .YMi.err
Council for plaintiff now requests
that the Court order the ballot box
to be opened in court, for the pur
pose, first, of examining the returns;
that is, the poll lists and tally sheets
in the box, for comparison with
those already produced in evidence,
and if after such examination the
Court thinks it necessary to do so
and proper to do so, in the interests
of justice, that the ballots be count
ed.
Judge Bled:
If the court please, before the bal
lot box is gone into-I frankly mean
what my client said-if the ballot
box can be produced in the condi
tion in which the law requires it to
be produced, we have no objection on
earth to its being brought here. I
do not mean to cast any insinuation
that any one has opened it. I do
not understand that I am required
to do that, and if I were, would not
make such a charge unless I could
back it up by evidence.
In my understanding of the law
it must first be shown to the Court
that no opportunity has been offered
for tampering with it.
If the purpose for opening it is tc
get the tally sheet out of it, I am sat
isfied there is no necessity of openi
ing it, because there is nothing in
there. They sent one to the secre
tary of state, one to the chairman
of the parish executive committee,
sad the third they gave to Mr.
Frederick, which they thought they
were entitled to do, whereas it should
have been locked in the box.
Mr. Miller:
The clerk of court is entitled to
one under Act of 1914.
audge Rbled:
If the purpose of opening the box
is to find out whether it contains
a tally sheet and a list of voters, I
do not want to sappress that evi
dene.
Mr, MNiser
I ase that it be produced for two
rlposes" first to see if there is a
tally sheet of the returns in It, and
it they are not satisfactory to the
ourt, then that the ballots be count
ed.
The ballot box was brought inte
court and -pened, and no returns
were found. lMr. Miller, for plain
tif, then aked for a counting.
Judge Ried objected on the
grounds that opportunity had been
offered for tmperling with the boxt
since it had been in the hands. of
the clerk; that tb. seals were brok
en, etc. And he asUkd the Court,
before final *uling, to hear testimony
as to the condlti4n e th~de box when
delivered to the. clerk 4JaUmery. S6,
and also as to its endition- Janu
try 31.
The Court ruled that. defendant
should have opportunity to produce
any evidence.

Bid Burns, Ofie Sharp and two depu

in the State box. Made out four

That there were two poll lists in

Ode Sharp:

Finished counting parish box at poll.
Took out parish tickets in State

some. There were twelve or fifteen

got coffee. Never left any more till
finish. *Can't say how long gone.
We fuond some State tickets in par

Badon's room.
Judge Ried, counsel for Crawford
hen put the box in testimony as to
its condition, and Judge Lancaster,
who examined -same in court, was
called to testify as to its condition,
to prove that seal was broken.
Jaudge Ianeaster:
That paper extending from top

Judge lancaster called attention,
from the bench, to he t-at that not a
witness seemed to know who sealed
the lbox. That the sealing was
clumsily -and lasecurely made, so
that the slightest Jar might loosen it.
At 5:40 court adjourned to 7:30

J..Lfitchett
To the Farmers of St. Tammany
Parish:
It has become my great pleasure
to be one of you by appointment as
county agent of the U. S. Department
of Agriculture for this parish. And
it is my earnest desire that I may
be of some assistance in not only
helping you make the year 1916 the
most prosperous one in your farm
ing history, but in the development
of this parish until it will be second
to none in agricultural prosperity.
The. main impression that I have
gained from my, observation is thst
of the great agricultural possiblli
ties of this seotion. and the great
future that awaits us, but this ulti- I
mate goal will never- be reached ex
cept by the sympathetic co-operation
of all forces, the practice of improv
ed and business methods of farming
and systematic organisation.
The farmers demonstration work
is. not theoretical or experimental but
rather very practical. We do not
ask you to experiment but only to
take advantage and put into practice
those fundamental and essential
methods of successful agriculture
which have been demonstrated be
yond a doubt to result in more in-J
creased and economical crop yields.
One of the retarding features of our
work is that many people have a
wrong conceptlon of its nature. They
call it "'book farming" or theoretical
farming. My friends, this is far
from correct. We only ask you to
put into practice simple, common
sense yet fundamentally important
methods of farming that the most
successful farmers have found to be
the best- and most profitable, and
those that our agricultural experi
ment stations have through actual
experiments demonstra'ed to be the
best methods and take these and
adapt them to your local conditions
or farm. While the writer believes
that he has a fair knowledge of
scientific agriculture both from tech
nical and practical experience, I do
not ask you t9 take my personal
advice altogether as an Individual
hbut as representative of the Universi
ty Agricultural Extension forces, and
the U. S. Department of Agriculture,
I hope to bring to your attention in
formation and instruction from these
sources,- that otherwise possibly
would not be available. Did you
ever stop to think that thousands of
dollars are spent for the accumula
tion of this agrieautural knowledge,
your money for your beneftt? Then
why not. take advantage of it?
While the is no set rule for
farmingt, there are some wvry Impor
tant and I will say imperative neces
sary rules of any scheme of suacese
ful agriculture and especially appli
cable to all southern conditions.
From these nave been evolved what
has been termed "Dr. Knapp'e Ten
Commandments of Agriculture," the
gospel of the demonstration wok.
Space does not permit going into
'these in detail, but briefly they are:
1. Prepare a deep and thorough
ly pulverimed seed bed well drained,
break in the fall to the depth of 8,
10 or 12 inches, according to the
soMl, with implements that will not
bring too much of the subsoil to the
surface; the foregoing depths should
be reached gradually.
2. Use deed of the best variety,
intelligently selected and carefully
stored.
3. In cultivated crops, give rows
and the plants In the rows a space
suited to the plant,' the soil and the
olimate.
4. Use intensive tilage during
the growing period of the crop,
5. Secure a high content of hum
us in the soil by the use of legumes,
barn-yard manere, larm refuse, land
commercial fert.lisers.
