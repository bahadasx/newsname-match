nature, information was received here
today at hurried precautions taken at

sist a threatened "invasion by German

A force of soldiers estimated at 500
men and three machine gun squads
were rushed there from St. Catharines

JPetrograd, Feb. 12.—The Russian
offensive, which has 'been indicated in
reports of the last few days, is ma
turing rapidly over the whole Gaii
cian front.
The Germans, according to late ad
vices, are -on the defensive on three
important rivers—the Sereth, the
Pruth and the Dniester. Czernowitz,
capital of Bukowlna, is again seriously
threatened by the Russian advance
east of Raranche, as well as by the
Russian crossing of the Dniester, at
Uscieozko, where their troops are firm
ly entrenoned. This move also has had
the effect of interrupting one of the
most important lines of communica
tion 'between the armies of Generals
Pflanzer and von Bothmer.
•A third important Russian advance
has .been recorded near Zale Szozyky,
where a fierce counter attack is de
clared to have ibeen successful in rout

extent that they retired to a new- line

BEAR HAS TURNED
Rusela Prepared to Rend Germans,
Saya Correspondent at Front.
Minneapolis, Feb. 12.—The bear has
turned, sayss-Stanley Washburn.
Russia is the bear.
There is going to be a terrific fight
against the big German whip—with
the bear maddened by blows and in
sults, according to Mr. Washburn, for
mer Minneapolis newspaper man, and
more recently war correspondent of the
London Times.
The whole gerat European war will
produce nothing in the near future that
will be so dramatic and so world Im
portant as the coming back of the Bear,
the great beast that last year was
flogged out of East Prussia and Poland,
he said in' Minneapolis today following
his arrival for a visit home.
Russia, the big, the strong, the re
sourceful and never yielding, will be
the country on which the world's eyes
will be focused before another ninety
days have passed, he said.
The second great period of Russian
activity will begin to manifest Itself,
he said, with the coming on of spring.
Wherever in the world It may have
been assumed that the loss of Lodz and
Warsaw, the taking by the Germans of
Poland and the falling back of the Rus
sian lines farther north meant that
Russia was out of the war, there will
be a rude awakening, he said. Russta,
Mr. Washburn said, has only just be
gun to fight.
"In August and September Russia
was at low tide," Mr. Washburn said.
"Ever sinc« then conditions have been
bettering •jin the Russian standpoint.
The Russians have been coming back
stronger every month.
"Not since last September has there
at any time been a military menace to
*Ruiisla. 'Whatever happened to Russia
happened, and however severe the ef
fect, It is over. Every month from now
on will see tho Russians in new offen
sive moves and stronger than ever.
"Germany hit. high tide on the east
em war frqnt about the same time,
August and September, that the Rus
sian tide wm at the ebb. Germany can
not get any. stronger in the east. But
Russia can get stronger and is getting
stronger every: day.
"In ninety days the whole world will
be watching Russia and you will hear
newspaper readers In street cars and
hotel lobbies and clubs and elsewhere
expressing, astonishment that defeated
Russia is again threatening to over
come Germany., But there will be noth
ing so astonishing about it. Russia
never was defeated."
Mr. Washburn expressed the confi
dent belief, that defeat for Germany Is
the only possible outcome.
*1 do not bfilleve it possible for Ger
many to make a separate peace In any
direction, that could be of material .ad
vantage," he said. "The coming on of
spring:, will mean the starting: of big
offensive and' defensive operations all
over.again' from.end to end of the war

St. Louis, Feb. 12.—An affidavit
found in Dr. Charles Kennerly's pocket
this morning explained the cause of the
fight with pistols, knives and dental
instruments in a room in a local hotel
last night in which Dr. Kennerly, of
Granite City, 111. Dr. A. F. Johnson,
of St. Louis Dr. Walter A. Dlefen
bach, of San Antonio, Tex., and Charles
Lodl, St. Louis, were injured. Johnson
and Kennerly were former classmates,
former business partners and are lodge
brothers.
In the affidavits, copies of whioh have
been sent to Masonic officers here, Dr.
Kennerly accused Dr. Johnson of fail
ure to pay a $2,5*00 debt and of with
holding other funds which Dr. Ken
nerly claimed were due him. The affi
davit asked that Dr. Johnson be ex
pelled from the Masonic order because
of the alleged wrongs to Dr. Keiinerly.
Johnson's Wounds Fatal.
This morning Dr. Johnson was near
death at the city hospital, his face and
body terribly slashed, and with a
wound between the hips and the groin,
made by a steel jacketed bullet.
Dr. Kennerly, also cut about the face
and arms, was a prisoner at the hos
