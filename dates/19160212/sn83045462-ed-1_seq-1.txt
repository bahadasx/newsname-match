not fair to say at this time that the ar
views of the United States on armed

If the temper of the allied govern- pa

th^ir diplomatic representatives here, w'
it is evident that any attempt by the
United States to change the present T?
rule permitting the use of American
ports by merchant ships armed for de- Di
fensive purposes will be met by a
strong protest. Correspondence also is
likely to follow if the United States assumes
a position which coincides with to

Awaiting Receipt of Notes. *v
The definite attitude of the United
Slates toward the stated intention of

after the formal texts of the '
notes, which have been handed to Am- r
bassador Gerard and Ambassador Penfield,
are received from Berlin and
Vienna Once the texts are before officials
here it is believed the position j
of this government quickly will be defined.
Only seventeen dajs remain before
German and Austrian submarine
maimers win atari to put their new
instructions into operation.
The view of at least some of tlie representatives
of the entente allies here
is that any change made in the rules |
bearing on submarine warfare during
the war would be an unneutral act.
The governments are represented as not
being prepared to admit that there has
been any change in the conditions of
naval warfare which would warrant j
jnerrchant ships armed for defensive
purposes being characterized as warships. j
Germany's Viewpoint.
In Teutonic quarters, however, it is j
contended that merchant ships armed !
for defensive purposes are really arm- |
ed for resistance, and that merchant I
ships have no right to resist. More- j
over, it is claimed bv tiermanv fhnt ?? i

I INKLING YET AS
TO WAR SECRETARY
Resident Removes Material
for Much Speculation by Taking
River Cruise.
/VITH MRS. WILSON GOES
ABOARD YACHT FOR REST
Hames of Cabinet Officers and Many
Congressmen Mentioned as Garrison's
Successor.
President Wilson took away
rem Washington last night maerial
for much speculation as to
he selection he will make of a
uccessor to Lindley M. Garrison
is Secretary of War. With Mrs.
.Vilson, the President suddenly
>oarded the naval yacht Maylower
last night and departed for
l short cruise down the Potomac
nrl f~"liocor\*?QL.-f? har ovnprtincr tn
eturn tomorrow night or Monday
norning.
As the trip is intended as a rest for
he President it is not presumed he is
oingr more than thinking over the
election he will make, but it Is expectd
he will not long delay the decision.
Score of Names Suggested.
A score or more of names, including
abinet officers, congressmen and promnent
men generally, have been suggest d
to the President, and are being
alked over throughout Washington,
imong these foremost consideration is
eing given to Secretaries Lane and
Louston and Counselor Polk of the
tate Department, it is said.
The shifting of any cabinet officer to
he War Department would leave a vaancy
that would draw further interst.
Friends of Joseph P. Tumulty, the
'resident's secretary, are concerned in
ossip that he may be promoted should
here be a cabinet shifting. Mr. Tumilty
is known to have no particular
ondness for War Department work
nd is not likely to be considered for
hat portfolio, but his friends believe
e stands an excellent chance of elevaion
to the cabinet whenever there is
vacancy in a position that would fit
n with his qualifications and desires.
Several names also have been sugested
for assistant secretary of war
o succeed Henry Breckinridge, but it
s generally taken for granted that the
President will leave the selection to
11 thts- rrnCKttCf" W*the new Secretary :
f War.
Gen. Scott Kept Busy.
Maj. Gen. Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff
f the army, who is temporarily adlinistering
the affairs of the War Peartment
under an executive order isLied
yesterday authorizing him to act
s Secretary bf War for a period not
xceeding thirty days, pending the ap- |
ointment of a regular Secretary of
Far, was an exceedingly busy man toay.
In addition to the routine business of |
is military office as chief of staff, he i
ras called upon to dispose of all the J
egular business of the purely civil es- 1
iblishment that has accumulated j
ince the resignations and sudden de- I
arture of former Secretary Garrison
nd former Assistant Secretary Breck- j
iridge Thursday. Two days* mail, j
lostiy of a routine character, was
iled on his desk in the early morning,
t came from all the bureaus and diisions
of the department. As each ;
atch was disposed of additions of
resh correspondence was placed before |
fie acting secretary and kept him allost
constantly engaged.
i the consideration of some of the letrs
to confer personally with the heads j
f most of the military bureaus and j
Iso to see mnay persons from the outside j
iving business requiring consideration !
om the head of the department. Al- j
tough a great mass of correspondence
as disposed of it is stated that Gen. j
x?tt carefully refrained from acting on ;
iv important matter of policy or any |
?w question that was likely to come be>re
the next civilian secretary for dcrmination.
General satisfaction was everywhere
anifested over the fact that the
lachinery of the great establishment,
hich had been temporarily interruptj,
was running smoothly again, and
lat there was a responsible head to
horn any important matter of husf- |
ess demanding immediate settlement j
>uld be submitted.
Expect Mr. Garrison to Return.
Although nobody in the War Departlent
has heard from Mr. Garrison
ince his hasty departure for New York
hursday afternoon, it is assumed in ;
ie immediate office of tiie Secretary
lat he will certainly return here in a j
?w days, at least, in order to airange!
jr the transfer of his private papers,
nd effects in his private office in the
f'ar Department and in his former
?sidence on Connecticut avenue. At
ny rate, he has not asked his former
rivate secretary nor any one else, so ,
ir as known, to attend to those niat;rs
for him.
Furthermore, it is indicated that Mr.
arrison will return to this city for the
jrpose of saying farewell to his forer
official associates and to assist in
le induction of his successor into of:-e.
in conformity with the usage in
ich cases. Mr. Breckinridge, who is
)w on a visit to Jamestown. Va., in
impany with Mrs. Breckinridge, may
so return to this city when his suc;s?or
is appointed, in order to introjce
him to his official associates and

Senator Martin, chairman of the appropriations

Items still in dispute between the two
louses are: The Senate amendment for

Senate* amendment relating; to the bureau
of engraving and printing; increasing
the number of delivered
sheets of United States currency, and
:ransferring appropriations already

Will Call Up Beport Monday.
Senator Martin gave notice that he
could call up the report Monday for con(ideration
in the Senate. Senator Newands
had explained that he tras not prewired
to go on with the discussion today.
When Senator Martin laid the report
before the Senate Senator Newlands
isked what disposition had been made
egarding the amendment io prevent
:he construction of the central power
alant under the existing-plans.
"The conference committee did not
igree to that amendment," replied Senitor
Martin. ; '
JT wish, then, to notify the Senate,"
aid Senator Newlands. "that failure to
dopt this amendment meana a serious
mpairment of the general plans of the
ark commission for tttt beautiflcation of
he Mall. I hope that senators will get
he statements of the eminent architects
nd engineers on this subject and read
hem before this matter is voted upon."
Senator Phelari of ' California asked if
he law did not provide that the fine arts
ommission must pass upon plans for such
'Uildings in Washington before the con
ract was let.
"Yes," said Senator Newlands, "uness
there is some special arrangement

did not pass upon the plane for
his building before the contract was
et; they were not laid before the comnission
until afterward. The comnission
has reported unfavorably upon
he plans.
Says Contract Was Illegal.
"Then the letting of the contract
ras illegal?" pursued Senator Phelan.

RUSSIANS RESUME
STRONG OFFENSIVE
Succeed in Capturing Heights

TCHEMERINE HEIGHTS

Slav Onslaught Gives Promise of
Spreading Along the Whole

PETROGRAD, via London, February
12.?Although a general revival of activity
is officially reported along the
entire Russian front, the only developments
of more than local and temporary
importance are the Russian advance
in the Stripa region, southeast
of Isebroff, where the Russians succeeded
in capturing heights commanding

tion by the Russians of the heights
east of Tchemerine.
The progress in the latter district,
which is between Rovno and Lutsk, is
another sign of the resumption of the
Russian offensive, which came to an
abrupt halt a month ago, when the
Germans apparently succeeded in
erecting such firm fortifications that
further attempts at an advance on the
part of the Russians became a waste
of energy and ammunition.
Due to Artillery Power.
It is considered significant that a
new and more formidable Russian offensive
Is being launched against the
same positions, and with initial successes.
This is explained by most of
the military observers as due to the
new power and effectiveness of the
Russian artillery, which recently has
shown marked improvement on all ?
fronts.
[ The Germans, evidently surprised by
the fierceness of the new Russian onslaught,
which promises to extend to a
general initiative along the whole line,
have been forced at several points in
Galicia to retire to their second line of
defense.
Russian Statement.
The following official Russian com
munication has just been issueo:
"In the Riga section, between the
Mttau road and the Dvina river, there
has been an active artillery duel. Our
artillery at many places dispersed
bands of enemy workmen. Five versta

I southeast of Ikskul two explosions occurred
in an enemy battery.
"In the region of Illoukst we exploded
a mine under a German blockhouse
and occupied the crater.
"As the result of a successful reconnaissance
in the region south of Lubtcha
we demolished a bridge which the
enemy had commenced to build across
the Niemen.
"Near Tchemerine (Volhynia).* by the
combined action of our infantry and
artillery, we again repulsed two successive
enemy counter attacks, which
were launched after preparations by
bombardments with heavy and light
artillery. Farther south our scouts
have made useful explorations.
"In the region of lsebroff the enemy
attempted to reconquer a height we
had taken from him. launching for the
purpose numerically superior forces.
who were supported by artillery fire.
We maintained possession of the
height, however."
Movements in Bessarabia.
LONDON, February 12. ? A Reuter
dispatch from Amsterdam says:
"Budapest advices received here are
to the effect that Russian railway communication
with Rumania is interrupted,
owing to troop movements in Bessarabia.
Only military trains are moving

Huge Increase in Value.
All of the land in the ten-mile strip
along; the canal subject to claims would
not be worth more than $1,000,000 as
its 1903 value, the general said, but it
is likely to cost $17,000,000 or $18,000,000
at the rates which have been paid.
"The joint land commissions?we have
had several of them?have taken the
ground that as we are a big republic, and
they are rather poor, we should not
be too hard on them, and that we should
pay liberally for their lands," the general
said. "As a consequence of this the
