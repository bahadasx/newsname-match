Resolutions Adopted.
Resolutions, proposed by the uni
versity faculty, were read and adopt
ed, as follows:
President Merrifleld did not, how
ever, confine his activities to the cam
pus. He was especially interested in
the problem of secondary education
and was the leader in the organiza
tion of our state high school system.
He Berved as state high school exam
iner from the establishment of that
office In 1891 until his resignation in
1909. To few men has It ever been
given to play so important and hon
orable a part in the early educational
history of a commonwealth.
We mourn his loss as a colleague
and as a friend. But he will not be
forgotten. His name Is permanently
Identified with the history of the uni
verslty and the state. His memory
will be cherished with abiding affec
tion in the hearts of all who know
him our university and our high
school system will form an imperish
able reminder of his wisdom, his en
ergy, his patience, and his faith.
We direct that this statement be
spread upon the records of the uni
versity council, that it be published
in the Quarterly Journal and the pub
lic press, and that a copy be sent to
the bereaved family In whose grief
and sense of loss we share.
Dean Kennedy's Address.
Dean Joseph Kennedy delivered an
address on the subject, "Webster Mer*
rifield and the University," his re
marks following.
It is, we need not say, with sad
hearts that we all assemble here to
day to pay a feeble tribute to the life
and worth of Dr. Webster Merrifleld,
whose death occurred at his home in
Pasadena, California, at midnight be
tween January 21 and 22. It is
eminently appropriate that the uni
versity set apart, in this manner, a
portion of this day to commemorate
his name, and his life of devoted ser
vice to the University of North Dako
ta.
Dr. Merrifleld was born in Wil
liam svllle, Vermont, July 27, 1862 and
was, therefore, 63 years of age at the
time of his death. As a boy he was
fitted for college In the academy of
his home town and entered Tale uni
versity In 1873, graduating therefrom
with honors in 1877. During his
course he was known as a brilliant
student and, being of the class who
went to college Instead of being sent,
he paid most of his way by tutoring
and doing Buch other odd Jobs as he
could flnd.
That was the keynote of his life:
he was thorughly simple and demo
cratic in his life and living, and
never feared work in fact, during
pact of his presidential administration
when, besides his executive functions,
he also did considerable teaching and
was personally solicitous for the wel
fare of his educational family, there
were times when ,he spent eighteen
orjjftiore out of the twenty-four at
hicpost, either on the bridge or at
thp,helm. All his waking hours were
freely and conscientious!iy given to the
unfrersity and its welfare—and in
deed the Institution was often in his
Sr. anxious dreams.

he
of the. university, who died at his
home in Pasadena, California, Janu
ary 22, 1916.
Dr. Merrifleld was a member of the
original staff of the university and
was connected with the institution
without interruption for twenty-five
years, from September,lg84. until
June, 1909. During the' last eighteen
years of this period he served as pres
ident. Dr.. l^eEFifleld brought to his
duties rips scholarship, a- strong
sfcnse of duty.high ideals 6t life, ana
a wonderfully kind and noble heart.
By temperament and training he was
peculiarly fitted for the pioneering
work he was called upon to do and
into this work he threw himself with
fine intelligence, boundless energy,
and tireless devotion, organizing one
after another, as circumstances per
mitted, each of the colleges now
forming our academic group. His
faith in the university and his loyalty
to Its irterests, though severely test
ed during the hardships of the earlier
years, never failed or faltered. He
never lost his confidence in the state
or in Its boys and girls. Indeed, one
of the most striking elements In his
work was his personal interest in ev
ery student and his unselfish efforts
In behalf of the well-being—moral
and physical as well as intellectual—
of all.

Part of the mystery whloh sur
rounded the tragic death of the girl,
18-year-old pupil of the Deerlleld
township high school, was solved
when It was discovered that she had
died of poison and that she had not
been attacked.
This afternoon it Is planned to take
Orpet to the woods where the body
was found, and have him retrace his
steps he took beside the girl, and at
the spot where the body lay through
the night until found by her father
at dawn.
Before this ordeal, he will be con
fronted by David James, deaf mute
teamster, who, in a written statement,
said he saw Miss Lambert and a
young man unknown to him In the
woods Wednesday, and that he saw
the man press a bottle to the young
woman's lips.

Then, according to officers, Orpet
said he left her and as he did so she
swallowed the poison, which caused
her death.
Officials Not Satisfied.
Orpet did not admit he actually
saw the girl die. He confessed, how
ever, he wrote her letter, making the
appointment, declined to continue as
her friend and later wrote another
letter to be delivered at her home in
Lake Forest, after the finding of her
body.
It is pointed out by detectives that
the second letter might have been
written to establish an alibi, the pur
pose of which was to indicate he had
not left Madison the night preced

Club Management Makes
Such Statement in Connec

Chicago, 111., Feb. 12.—Belief that
the hundred guests iiiade ill at a
banquet to Archbishop Mundelein, at
the University club Thursday night,
were the victims of a deliberate at
tempt to poison, was announced by
the manager of the club today.
According to his statement, a con
siderable amount of active poison was
placed in the soup served at the ban
quet by an employe in the club
kitchen. The man is described as a
fanatic, whose mentality is possibly
disordered.
The analysis of the soup disclosed
the presence of mineral poison. The
suspected man, who has disappeared,
had a carefully equipped laboratory
and several bottles of poison, in his
rooms.
Archbishop Mundelein was not af
fected, though many of the prelates
and other distinguished guests at his
table suffered severely.

Not Willing to Agree on the
Proposal for Disarmament
of Merchant Ships.
CONFERENCE WAS
HELD TODAY
Oral Representations Made
to America—No Official
Announcement.
Washington, Feb. 12.—Diplomatic
representatives of England, France,
Russia and Italy have made oral rep
resentations to Secretary Lansing re
garding the American memorandum
to their governments suggesting the
disarming of merchant ships and that
armed merchant men entering Ameri
can ports might be regarded as war
ships.
Although the state department de
clined to disoloae the nature of the
representations. It is rumored that
Secretary Lansing was informed that
the entente governments are unwill
ing to adopt the. suggestion.
Formal'replies to the memorandum
are expected. It is considered doubt
ful -that 'the exact position of the
United States will be defined until aft
er they have been received.
Texts of notes from Germany and
Austria, which have been handed to
Ambassadors Gerard and Penfield,
setting .forth the Intentions of those
governments to treat armed merchant
ships of the entente allies as war
ships, after the last of this month,
also are being awaited.
So far, tt is said, the representa
tions of the entente representatives
had to do solely with the American
memorandum.
High officials declared It Is not fair
to say at this time that the view of
the United States on armed merchant
vessels is absolutely in accord with
the views of Germany and Austria.
Officials will make no decision until
the official texts have been received
from Berlin and Vienna.
UNFIT MEN MAY

Berne, Bwitserland, via Paris, Feb.

tions made by the Swiss and Spanish
governments, has agreed that not on
ly women, children and old men may
he allowbflf to le«r«i de
partments occupied by Germany, but
that all men unflt for military service
may leave. Under this decision the
transportation of 20,000 additional
persons began yesterday. Already
96,000 French civilians have- been
sent to France by way of Switzerland,
while 9,200 Germans and 2,600 Aus
trlans have been liberated from
France. The conveyance of these
persons required 465 special trains.
10,000 IN AUSTRIAN ARMY.
Paris, Feb. 12.—It is estimated by
the Geneva correspondent of the
Temps that the Austrian army now
operating in Albania consists of no
more than 10,000 men. Its progress
since passing Alessio hasbecome
most difficult, he says, as has been the
bringing up of supplies.
The correspondent says Prince Wil
liam of Wled, former ruler of Albania,
is now on the frontier of that coun
try, having been supplied with funds
from Austria and Germany for the
purpose of organising an army of Al
banians. It is said he has alrerady
brought together 10,000 men.

Congressman Gardner and His Table Showing Navy's Poor Work at Target Practice*.
(By Hon. A. P. Gardner.)
Congressman Kltchln, the democra
tic leader of the house of representa
tives, says that we are already amply
defended. He tells us that our navy
ranks second among the navies of the
world. I say that we rank either a
bad third-or a good fourth. Mr. Kit-'
chin cites the evidence of Admiral
Badger and Admiral Fletcher. I say
that he has put the wrong interpre
tation on those offlcera' evidence and
in refutation I present the following
letter from Acting Secretary of the
Navy F. D. Roosevelt, who says that
"our navy probably stands fourth":
of the latest type. I am therefore
forced to the conclusion that our navy
probably stands fourth on the list at
the present time.
I would thank, you very much not
to mentibn in your address that any
of this Information has been officially
rceived by the navy department. As
I stated before, it is all based upon
reports published in the dally press
and verified by the -department as far
as is practicable. Sincerely,
(Signed) Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Acting Secretary of the Navy.
Secretary Daniels' ought to come
out in plain Engllah and tell us just
where hie department thinks our
navy ranks, oanaot quite under
stand why he haa net done ao. To
be sure the secretary in response to
Congressman Madden's latter declared
on Jan. 11, 191«. that "the ^4.

CONFESSES TO PART IN MURDER
Greenville, Pa., Feb. 12.—J. Fred
Christy, aged 17, son of John W.
Christy, wealthy farmer whose body
was found at the bottom of an aban
doned mine shaft near here last
Tuesday, and Fay Etzweiler, aged 20,
were arrested here yesterday and
charged with the murder of the elder
Christy. According to the authori
ties, Christy confessed his part in the
crime, saying he gave Etzweiler $50
to flre the shot which caused his
father's death. Robbery was the mo
tive of the crime, according to the
police. After the boys had been giv
en a hearing late yesterday they were
hurriedly taken from here to Mercer.
20 miles distant, owing to fears of
possible violence.
to the navy department asking ex
actly where our navy ranks, I venture
to say that you will be sent a little
pamphlet entitled "Information Con
cerning Some of the Principal Navies
of the World." I doubt, however,
whether your question will be direct
ly answered. On page 7 of that
pamphlet, which by the way was pre
pared by the U- 8. office of naval in
telligence, you will flnd a table of the
relative order of warship tonnage of
the principal navies of the world at
the time the European war broke
out. The table shows that on July l,
1914, reckoning vessels then building
as well as vessels already built, the
relative standing of the leading navies
of the world was as follows:
Great Britain 3.71S.756 tons
Germany 1.S04.C40tons

GARRISON ACT
This newspaper exprema the opin
ion that congress undoubtedly repra*
sents the majority sentiment in Amer
ica in opposing the abandonment of
old principles.
Dai lids to Follow.
"The feeling in congress plainly
thoroughly peaceful. The propaganda
for gigantic armaments, which has
been staged by Secretary Garrison
and Secretary Daniels, has received
thus far no sympathy from the rep
resentatives of the people. Hr. Gar
rison and his assistants already have
resigned, and the secretary of the
navy may soon follow."
See Settlement.
The Morgan Post publishes a Reu
ter dispatch saying that the United
States expected to accept the German
memorandum regarding the treat
ment of hostile armed merchantmen
as warships and to advise American
citizens to avoid belligerent ships. It
says such action on the part of tha
United States would be calculated to
do away quickly with existing differ

mediately accepted.
Arthur C. Gooding of Rochester

Smith.
Smith remained in a Minneapolis

Berlin. Via London, Feb. 12.—The
North German Oasette yesterday

it is alleged that German and Austro
Hungarian subjects have been taken
by British and French warships from
neutral vessels, contrary to Interna
tional law, about 8,400 civilians thus
having been been made prisoners.
The newspaper specifies two American
ships, the Manchuria and the Henry
Smith, from which it says civilians
were taken by the British, and three
American vessels, the Carolina, Co
am and San Juan, from which civil
ians were removed by French war
craft. It does not, however, refer to
the successful protests of the Ameri
can government with regard to the
three last named steamers.
