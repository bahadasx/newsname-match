It's a small word of four letters, yet
what ablutlonary miracles on the map
of male humanity the' vocal signal has
accomplished. Prom the inhabitant
of Glastenbury , who wagered that if
Grover Cleveland was' elected, he
would never, cut his halr-and' lost
down to the man who gets a shave
twice a month whether he needs .it
or not, the knights of the razor and
shears have been singing their song
to the gurgle of bay-rum and witch
hazel. It has been a long and dreary song
sometimes to the man on his feet be
hind the tonsorial, operating table
eight, ten or twelve hours a day. But
all the world's a shave and a mighty
close shave, too, for some folks and
men, (and some women,) in It only
shavers. Therefore the artist of the
lather-kettle is the man who keeps
the town 1 from barbarism through
.barberism and to him all credit is
due, although sometimes his scis

though the barber had lifted his hoof
when his blade became dull aud
slapped the scalpel back and forth on
the tap of his shoe.
Bennington is possessed of several

the average town of this size boasts.
The trouble is that the average male
Bennlngtonian becomes so used to the

The average shop in a town of this

lather or shampooing being heated

tory of the shops is known and some
of it is Interesting.
The stand on North street now oc
cupied by John Allard has been a bar
ber stand since North Btreet was In
vented. So too was the shop in the
Putnam House now sponsored by
Lyons Brothers. The latter is the
successor of a shop which has fol
lowed tho vicissitudes of the Old
Stark house when the hotel moved
across the street and' took the name
of the Putnam House.' It was origin
ally run by an old colored gentleman
named Berry to which race the bar
ber business has fallen as instinctive
ly as the propensity for watermelon
or sleeping in the sun. "Old Man
Lerry" conducted the business for a
number of years until after a change
in ownership, tho present proprietors
began swinging the razor under the
Sigu.
Some of the shops on North street
are more recent arrivals. Coming up
Main street to the talk-shop of the
genial Charley Firth, one finds one
of the oldest stands in the city, if not
the oldest. The shop has swung the
tonsorial sign at the same stand for
nearly fifty years without a break'
Just who started the etand is some
what indefinite, hut over 35 years ao
Edward Moon was footing up his cash-i
drawef evenings and giving sonorous
instructions to the present "Charley"
about' building the fires the following
morning. The gentleman with the
pleasant, smile who beckons you in at
this old stand was then working for
Moon learning how to chop off iacial
scenery without a nose being swept
up in tho remains beneath the chair
afterward. Subsequently on the de
mise of his proprietor, Firth bought
the business and has been running it
for the past 25 years.
J. V. Farmer, whoso model shop is
further up the street, is another old
timer at the business, having run a
shop In several locations before get
ting his present location. Fred Hop
kinson, whose death occurred recent
ly, had been at his stand opposite the
Baptist church for a number of years
It is remarkable how long most of
the local barbers have been doing
business. And , in the time curious
changes have taken place in the
craft; ' : Thirty years ago 'mankind ran
to whiskers. ! The -wilder and more
fanciful the faciKl brush, the more of
a mail was the owner. To grow a sel
of whiskers was secondary oply tc
voting or perspiring over a first cigar.
Today the safety-rnaor people have
changed all this. The youngster con
slders himself eligible to man's cstatt
when ho can muster a sufficient nurfi
ber of plneathers to have them re
moved, instead of investing iu a guar
antred hair grower and having hit
picture "took" with the chin append
ages of a Henry Cabot Lodge. Tlu
barber3 aver that regardless of thr
appetite for chin-streamers existing
in the eighties there is now less shav
ing being done In the barber shop?
than then. Mankind can now sloe
around a wet brush on hla jaw aftei
greasing the same with a shuvln?
stick and four minutes of frisking c
Gem or a Gillete over his countenance
makes him ready "with the sun, bis
daily stage of duty to run.".
In the matter of hair-cuts, it used
to be the practice in Bennlngtor
shops to open on Sunday. The Good
Book claiming it was permissible tc
do good on. the Sabbath, the tonsorial
crew extended the passage to makin?
Bennington men loss barbaric In the
nietter of hair. For year3 Mr. Moon
ivould not cut hair on Saturday
nights. Shaving only, followed the
old- fashioned weekly supper of
baked-beans and brown-bread, 'f a
man wanted his head .harvested, the
job waited until Sunday or a week
day. And the price then was only
20c. Those were the days when man
kind did not llvo nt a forty-horsepower
speed. It was no uncommon
sight in those days to see from a doz
en to twenty men waiting in a shear
shop while one man and a hoy gath
ered in the ten and 20-eent pieces.
Today more men are required be
cause the moment a man stumbles in
tho door over a growth of beard that
bothers his ankles, ho wants the snip
ping to start as soon as the barber
can reach for the clippers. Then lie
sits down and reads "Puck" for half
ian hour or discusses the speed cf his
Ford automobile.
A curious feature in the evolution
of the barber shop is the epitaph
tacked on the bay-rum bottle. Once
we knew when a man had been in a
barber's chair because lie gave off
oders like a perfume factory. The
hair-cut-and-shavcr made a concoc
. tion of bay-rum and oil that cost hiiri

ONCE LIVED IN WOODFORD
Elmer E. Smith,' Who Was Killed by
Train in Rutland Tuesday Evening.
Elmer E. Smith, the painter lu the
employ of the Howe Scale company
;n Rutland, who was killed Tuesday
evening by a train on the Bellows
Falls division of the Rutland railroad,
when a boy lived In the town of
Woodford.
There is something of a mystery at
tached to the tragedy for it Is under
itooil that the young man had with
him at the time money which be
longed to the painters' union which
"ould not be found after the body was
liscovered. His gold watch was also
misting. The union funds he carried
in a small handbag. It 13 also under
stood that he had money of his own
in a pceket which likewise dl ap
peared. The young man leaves a brother,
Joseph E., in Stockbridge and two sis
ters, Emily S. Smith, a trained nurse,
of Rutland and Mrs. Margaret Kstes
of Woodford. Other survivors are a
widow, a 12-year-old son and a
mother, Mrs. Isabello Johnson, matron
of the cottago hospital in Rutland. He
was SO years old.

unknown. When the whiskers were
decapitated, the towel which had
choked off his breath had a corner
dabbed in water, sopped round his
Ventures; then a bench-bottle consist:
ing of 07 percent pungent Oder was
swashed in the barber's hand and
splashed on the inert patient's bronz
ed cheek. Menneu hadn't hitched up
his trousers and made a million dol
lars by advertising talcum powder, so
there followed a solution ot magnesia
which unless well mopped ofT after
ward, left the victim with a complex
ion like chalk only whiter. But tho
pure, unadultered bay-rum that
'was a treat for the wealthy or the
spend-thrlft. Many an old time bar
ber can yet see the sign, "Bay Rum,
Sc. Extra" which hung iu a prominent
place in the shop.
Today witch-hazel is cheaper than
hay-rum as well as cleaner and more
pleasing to the skin In its after-effect.
Today, also, state regulations in re
gard to the sanitation of barber shops
have provided many extras for tho
:inan who prefers to mix politics and
I' conversation with his tonsorial ro-
j quirements. A clean hot towel must
I go with every shave and instruments
,' and equipment must be periodically
sterilized.

J MEDAL FOR WALTER L. HURD.
North Bennington Wins Distinction at
Norwich University.
During chapel exercises at Norwich
University Thursday, the Robert H.
Wilson development medal was pro
rented to Walter L. Hurd of the fresh
man class, by Col. Ira L. Reeves, presl
dent of the university. ' Tho medal Is
one annually awarded by II. C. Wilson
of Lyndonville, In memory of his son,
to the member of the freshman class
showing the greatest all-around de-
j'.velopment during the first semester.
The conditions governing tho award
of the handsome medal require that
the student receiving it have a pass
ing mark In all his subjects, and that
the members of tho freshman class
alone decide on the student most de
serving of tho prize.
Mr. Hurd is the grandson of Mr.
and Mrs. William K. Hurd of North
Bennington, and a graduate of the
North Bennington high school in the
class of 1914. Since taking up his
studies at Norwich last September he
has-entered into the spirit of the Unl-J
versify,- and identified himself with
severs" of Its .organizations;'- notably
the glee club and land.- His military
standing has shown marked improve
ment, and his application- in . his stud
ios has given him the rank of fourth
place in the freshman class. General
satisfaction is voiced by the entire
corps of the university at the decision
of the class, which not only, speaks
well for Mr. Hurd's ability, but also
Indicates the esteem . in which he is
held by his fellow classmates.

the honors of the VY" 2nd a with 5

WORST GRIP YEAR IN DECADE
Bennington Severely Hit in Natioti
W'ido Affliction.
Tho grip ei idetr.ln ceases to be a sub
.feet fcr thoughtless wit. Those who
have been detained at home for a day
or a week may laugh at those under
tho weather, but the fact stands that
tbis winter has been the worst season
for fatalities from tho disease and its
more serious twin-ailment, pneu
monia, of any for the past decade. Al
most a funeral a day has taken place
during the last few weeks.
Tho firm of J. Ed. Walbridjs re
ports that from one cause or another
they have had more funerals during
the past month of January than at
any timo within the memory of its es
teemed proprietor and. Mr. Walbridge
has uufortunatey been called upon to
attend to nearly 8500 deaths and fun
erals, since ho began business in
North Bennington years ago.
A sober thought in bringing the fact
of this winter's mortalities home lies
in the unusual circumstance of seven
elderly ladies being prepared for bur
ial by this firm during the week just
passed ' The majority of deaths wero
from pneumonia and they occurred
among those past 65 years of age.
The two other undertakers in town,
M. J. Welch and II. P. Yvoodman have
also received their share of tho un
fortunate ordeals. Bennington is not
alone in its affliction, however. Re
ports from other parts of the country-
show that the increased mortalities of
this over other years is almost nation
wide.
WEATHER FORECAST
For eastern Is'ew York and western
Vermont rain or snow tonight and
Sunday, somewhat warmer.

DEnlEB Bt BRITISH ADMIRALTY
London Claims Victim of Kaler'
Mlsqulto Fleet Was Only a
Mine Sweeper.
London, Feb. 11. A Berlin official
statement received here today claims
that a British cruiser has been 3imk
by a German torpedo boat craft and
another British cruiser torpedoed.
The British official press bureau do
Lies; this.
The German statement was to tho
effect that the German torpedo craft
met British cruisers off. the Dogger
Bank on Thursday night and sank the
new cruiser Arabia and torpedoed a
secend cruiser.
In giving out -the German message
for publication tho press bureau ap
pended the following:
"The British Admiralty states that
the cruisefs above mentioned were
four mine-sweeping vessels, three of
which have returned safely."
Tho text of tho German statement
follows: "On the night of the 10th
and 11th during an advance of our
torpedo beats, our boats met on the
Dogger Bank, some 12 sea miles east
of the English coast, several English
cruisers, which at once fled. Our
boats pursued them and sank the new
cruiser Arabis and obtained a hit
with a torpedo on a second cruiser.
Our torpedo boats rescued the com
mander of the ArabiB with two other
officers and 21 men. Our forces suf
fered damage, but no losses."
The British cruiser Arabis Is not
listed In the current naval publica
tions. This is explained by the fact
that the names of the new boats of
the British navy have not been given
out by the Admiralty because of war
condition!!.
