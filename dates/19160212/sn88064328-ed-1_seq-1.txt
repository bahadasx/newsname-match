SPEECH OF COL. PLEASANT.
Col. Ruflin («. Pleasant, the
Democratic nominee for the office
of Governor of the State of Lou
isiauu delivered the subjoined ad
dress at the meeting of the State
Democratic organization at New
Orleans on Wednesday which
practically opens up the cam
paign for State offices:
"Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen
of the Democratic State Central
Committee:
"As I accept the nomination
for governor at the hands of this
committee of the democracy of
the State, and of a great major
ity of the electorate of our com
nwealth, my heart is filled v. ith
deep appreciation and gratitude,
and 1 am all but overwhelmed
with a solemn sense of obligation
and responsibility. The recent
primary election, with its tre
mendous Democratic vote, shows
that the destinies of Louisiana are
still firmly guided by the sacred
principles of our party.
"The best traditions and the
greatest glories of Louisiana have
been interwoven inseparably with
the history of triumphant deinoc
racy. Our blackest pages have
been written by the hand of the
Republican. Iiis twin brother is
the Progressive. Both advocate
ideas in common. Tliey are unit
cd in Louisiana today for pelf,
power and subserviency to Roos

white and the black races in
South America, and who, at the

White House, set the example of
social equality for the Linled
States.
"Shall we surrender to them
the control of our fair state so
that they may repeat the history
they have already made, an j in
order that Roosevelt may gather
more strength to aid him in die
tating to the national Republican
convention in June?
"There are more than one liun
dred thousand Democrats in Lou
isiana who thunder—No !
"They say, too, that we are for
Wlisou with honorable peace, and
not for Roosevelt with uncon
scionable Avar.
"My friends, we arc strong
and united. From country and
city, from the corn, the cotton
and the rice fields, from the lum
ber mills, the oil ifistriets, and
from every other industry of the
State, there swells to high heaven
the choral chant of white Demoe
racy. Neither Republican cupid
ity nor Progressive vanity can
hush it. A lown the corridors of
time it will echo and re-echo in
tuneful consonance to the glorv'hcr
of the party of Jefferson and
Jackson and Cleveland and Wil
son and Nicholls and McEnerj —
J the party that redeemed Louisi
ana with battle and blood; that
built her school houses and levees;
and under whose administrations
her taxable properties have in
|creased one-half a million of dol
lars in assessed valuation. It is
' the party that has invited cap
jital, factories, and railroads into
this state through liberal tax ex
Ali A. PEAL.
To those cf onr citizens who think tbe cause worthy of con
sideration, this is addressed.
Permission has been granted me to use the City Jail Build
ing as a Charity Hospital, provL ed its repair, equipment, and
maintenance can be assured with no expense to the City treasury.
The necessity of some place to care for unfortunates, who at
times, call on the Citv for aid has been forcibly demonstrated on
many occasions in the past. The future, no doubt, will present the
same problem. It is possible to cc nvert-this building into an insti
tution which will meet the requirements, but to do so will neces
sitate the expenditure of a sum which will have to be provided
by a source other than the one stated. The amount needed will
not be excessive, and its conservative management will enable the
materialisation of plans which will afford the relief sought.
None are so poor as the f rien dless and destitute ; the stranger
in a strange place, without funds to enable him to provide the ne
cessities when ill, presents a sad situation—one not easily forgot
ten. It is in behalf of these, and those of our own City, who need
our aid, that I ask contributions. No amount is too small, and
will be gladly received.

City Physician.

NO WONDER I
With three-fourths of the civ
ilized world engaged in interna
tional piracy and banditry, there
is little wonder the members of.
the American underworld are
stimulated to emulate in their
small way the shining examples
set for them by the chancellories
of Europe and Japan. St. Louis,
for instance, is almost on the
verge of resorting to "vigilante"
tactics to suppress a wave of
crime. The law -abiding people
of St. Louis have taken the first
istep in this direction, organizing
what is called a "Taxpayers' Pro
tective association," and offering
through advertisements, rewards
of $300 and $6,000, for the arrest
and conviction of murderer« and
.kald-np men.—JGalTeston Tribu».
