Resignation of Secretary of War
Brings About Better Feeling
Between Houses.
CONFIDENCE OF PRESIDENT
IN NATIONAL BODY SHOWN
General Belief Is That Continent­
al Army Scheme Will Be
Dropped.
WJashinglon, Fob. 11.—A now nolo
on economy and co-operation of na­
tional defense problems was struck
in tlio house military commitlce to­
day as a direct resnli of I lie resigna­
tion of Secretary Garrison of the
war department. If round expression

dence President Wilson reposed in it.
and in the senate commit too as dis­
closed in It is correspondence with
Mr. Garrison.
The non-partisan character of lie
feeling was emphasized by the fact
that, the resolution was offererl by
Representative Kahn of California,
ranking republican member of llie
committee.
Clears Atmosphere.
Members of both the congressional
committees declared that the war
secretary's withdrawal had brought
out sharply the president's desire that
the congrcsM should work out tho
army problem in" its own best judg­
ment. The net result, they agreed,
wfts a. Clarification of the congres­
sional atmosphere and assurance of
the suplort for the bill that will be
drafted Vrom elements of both the
democratic and republican sides, that
had heretofore been counted against
the measure.
In substance, it is believed, the
bills will represent an effort to make
effective virtually all of the plans
of the war department, with the ex­
ception that federalization of the Na­
tional Guard will be sought as a sub­
stitute for the continental army plan.
Drafting Bills.
Final steps toward beginning the
drafting of the measures were taken
today by both the house and senate
committees.
The house bill, it is expected, will
provide for payment of National
Guardsmen who comply with all reg­
ulations laid down iby congress on a
basis sufficiently liberal to insure the
recruiting of approximately 400,000
men, the ultimate size of the propos­
ed continental army. To make cer­
tain thfc "'availability for federal use
in time of wsir or gi'eat emergency of
all men who participate in this pay­
ment, th# plan' contemplates author­
izing the president to draft them into
a volunteer army.
iBuy Lower California.
iA
resolution to authorize President
Wilson to negotiate with Mexico for
the purchase''of Lower California was
•presented to the house today by Rep­
resentative '.Randall of California.
President Wins Fight.
President Wilson practically won
his fight for ratification of the Nicara
guan treaty in executive session of
the senate today. Some of its most
vigorous opponents said the adminis
ration had won enough votes to gain
the two-thirds required and predicted
its ratification tomorrow.
The administration's opponents,
while they conceded they expected
the Nicaragua convention "would go
through, reiterated they would pre­
vent ratification of the Colombian
treaty to pay an indemnity and ex­
press regrets for the partition of
The Xicaraguan treaty proposed to
pay Nicaragua $3,000,000 for inter
oceanic canal rights and naval bases
in the Bay of Fonseca.
Assurances to Costa Rica, Salva
dora and Honduras that none of their
rights will be violated by the United
States acquiring a naval base in the
Bay of Fonseca, will be incorporated
in the ratification resolution on the
Nicaraguan treaty.
Tulsa, Okla., Feb. 11.—Two youth­
ful robbers of about 21 years, late to­
day held up the cashier in the bank
of Red Forks and escaped with $184
.35, scooped off the counter. A posse
started in immediate pursuit.
Two young men., riding horses,
"were taken into custody less than an
hour later, without a shot being fired
and the sheriff announced that they
admitted the robbery.

SIX ARRESTED
IN CONNECTION
T^iree Chicago Men and Wives
Believed to Have Robbed St.

MOST IMPORTANT CAPTURE
BY FEDERAL AUTHORITIES
Chicago, Feb. 1L—Three men and
three women, alleged to "have blown
open the vault of the United States
collector at St. Paul, on January t,
and to have escaped with $",000 in
money and revenue stamps A/^iued at
$57,357, were arrested here today.
Certain papers found on the person
of one of the prisoners suggested
connection with the robbery of the
New Westminster branch of the Bank
of Montreal.
The arrest today and the recovery
of two trunks full of revenue stamps
were said by Michael L. Igoe, of the
United tlSates district attorney's of­
fice here, to be the most important
made by federal agents in years. Mr.
Igoe will arraign the prisoners be­
fore a commissioner tomorrow, and
said that bonds of $100,000 will be
demanded in each case. The pris­
oners, who live in Chicago, are: Mi­
chael Jj. J. Flannigan, saloonkeeper,
and wife, Edward Leonard, alleged
ex-convict, and wife, John J. Zack and
wife.
Recover Booty.
The St. Paul robbery engaged the
attention of secret service men, rev­
enue agents, private and municipal
detectives of a number of states.
The stamps taken were negotiable
and every wheel in the governmental
machinery was set going for their re­
covery. Clerks will work all night
counting the stamps recovered, but it
is believed the trunks contained most
of the booty. A fourth man was be­
ing looked for tonight in connection
with the robbery.

St. Paul, Minn., Feb. 11.—Walter J.

Ramsey county deputy sheriffs at a

lowing his indictment, by the county

Allied Governments May Raise
Objections to Recent German
Submarine Plan.
Washington, Fe)b. 11,—Diplomatic
negotiations of various characters
soon will confront the United iStates
as the result of the expected inten­
tion of the German and Austrian gov­
ernments to treat armed ships of the
Entente allies as war vessels after
February 29.
Apparently, it is certain if the tem
qier of the Allies' governments can be
judged by the feeling of their diplo­
matic representatives here, any at­
tempt by the United States to change
the rule permitting the use of Ameri­
can ports by ships armed for defens­
ive purposes will be met by a strong
protest.
On the other hand, the United
States itself may take the initiative
should the Entente allies impose a
virtual boycott in American ports, in
the event of this government deciding
that armed merchant ships entering
American waters are ships of war
and therefore subject to internment.
The definite attitude of the United
States toward the stated intention of
Germany and Austria will be deter­
mined after the formal text of the
note which has been handed to Am­
bassador Gerard and Ambassador
Penfield are received from Berlin and
from Vienna. Once the texts are 'be­
fore officials, it is believed the posi­
tion of this government will be dee
fined.
American officials seemed inclined
lo the view that the contention of
the German and Austrian govern­
ments is well founded and informa­
tion came today that the United
States might warn its nationals to
remain off merchant ships that are
armed.

Artois region of 'France and the Bo­
hemian and east Galic.ian sections of
the Russian line, llie virtual inactiv­
ity i^hat has prevailed for several
days continues.
The Italians and Ausirians are

snow in the mountain regions, and
here and there are delivering infan­
try attacks against, encli other, but
without: result.

tance to the northeast of the port, of

sume an offensive arc being put down

(Hard fighting is still in progress
around Vilmy, where the French are
endeavoring to retake positions tak­
en from them by the Germans. Ber­
lin reports that four French attacks
in this region have been put down
and also that a similar offensive,
with a like purpose, to the south of
the ISomme, resulted in failure.
The iBelgian legation in London
brands as untrue a report that Bed
gium recently made peace proposals
to Germany.
New Russian Offensive.
Although a general revival of activ­
ity is officially reported along the en­
tire Russian fronts, the only develop­
ments of more than local and tempor­
ary importance are the Russian ad­
vances in the Stiippa regions, south­
west of Isebroof, where the Russians
succeeded in capturing heights com­
manding the district in which runs
the main railway line between the
Chodrov and Styra rivers, and the oc­
cupation by the Russians of the
heights east of Chemerine.
The progress in the latter district,
which is between Rovno and Lutsk,
is another sign of the resumption of
the Russian offensive, which came to
an abrupt halt a month ago. It is con­
sidered significant that a new and
more formidable Russian offensive is
being launched against the same po­
sitions and with initial successes.
This is explained by most of the mil­
itary observers as due to the new
power and effectiveness of the Rus­
sian artillery, which recently has
shown marked improvements on all
fronts.
The Germans have been forced at
several points in Galicia to retire to
their second line of defense.
Approve Submarine Plan.
The German government's decision
to treat armed merchantment of hos­
tile countries as warships has been
received with the heartiest approval.
The press of all parties expresses
the belief that neutrals will now be
compelled to avoid all merchantmen
of nations at war with Germany and
also to treat, sucli vessels when in
their harbors as warships, granting
them only the usual right to a limit­
ed stay.
Die Post says it thinks Germany's
submarine warfare will now continue
effectively: "Therein lies our great­
est hope," the newspaper adds.
Report of Naval Fight.
The text, of the German statement
follows:
"On the night, of the 10th and 11th
during an advance ftf our torpedo
boats, our boats met on the Dogger
bank, some 120 sea miles east of the
English coast, several English cruis­
ers, which at. once fled. Our boats
pursued them and sunk the new cruis­
er, lArras. And obtained a hit with a
torpedo on a second cruiser. Onr
torpedo boat rescued the commander
of the Arras with two other officers
and 21 men. Our forces suffered dam­
age, but no losses."
Cruisers Reported Sunk.
A Berlin official statement received
here today claims that' a British cruis­
er had been sunk by a German tor­
pedo boat craft, and another British
cruiser torpedoed. The British offi­
cial press bureau denies this.
The German statement was to the
effect that the German torpedo craft

EXCEEDED BONDMEED,
Startling .facts in connection with the capital removal
tion are disclosed by the Public Opinion of Bismarck,
states that the bankers of Grand Porks, in alliance with other finan­
ciers of the eastern section of the state are in a gigantic deal
to
foist a $10,000,(XX) bond issue upon the state.
Capital removal is the ruse through which the excellent
of this state will be utilized to float more bonds. North.
securities are eagerly sought after and Chicago and
bankers, it, is said, are instigating the Crand Forks bankers.
The Public Opinion says:
"Certain bankers of Grand Porks at the instigation
of Chi­
cago bankers conceived the idea of requiring the State
of N. D.
whose bonds stand at the very top of the market
as a -security,
to issue more bonds. The scheme is to move the capital
and ask for
a. $10,000,000 bond issue to go through-with the project.

must be remembered that investers always

by illegal use of the mails under the
name of John H. Putnam, has been
engaged in Germany propaganda, ac­
cording to a statement made tonight

Banks as a rule do not permit peti­
tions of any kind to be circulated
among their customers. Why this ex­
ception? The activity of certain
bankers has aroused suspicion
throughout the state and the farmers
are asking why banks should be se­
lected as the center in each town
from which to direct the capital re­
moval fight.
What is there in it for the hankers?
That is the question the voters are
asking.
The issuance of ten millions of
bonds for capital purposes would be
a neat financial coup. In any event
capital removal means a large expen­
diture of state funds, and of course
bankers are always direct beneficiar­
ies, but the voters must pay the
freight.
This merely brings home with
greater emphasis the danger that
lurks in signing petitions. Capital re­
moval means increased taxes. It will
impose a burden on the tax payers
without giving him anything in return.
It is just as well to scrutinize the
activity of the bankers in this light
in the light of a possible bond issue.
The state now has a debt of
$120,000 in excess of the constitu­
tional limit.
Wlhy should the voters sign peti­
tions and start something they can­
not finish?
Why are the bankers In the eastern
money centers so interested?
