IS NOW EXILED IN GERMANY
The New York American pub
lishes the following account of an
interview with Sir Roger Casement,
tho noted Irish leader, who is now In
Germany. As is well known, Sir
Roger came to Germany from New
York shortly after the outbreak of
tho war. Tho efforts of tho British
Government to intercept Sir Roger
at Christiana have been told. A
prlco was put on his head and an
offer was made in writing by Mr.
Findlay, tho British Consul at Chris
tiana, to Sir Roger's Norwegian man
servant TO DO AWAY WITH THE
IRISH PATRIOT, offering $5,000
for his assassination, this being
proven conclusively. The plot was
foiled by the loyalty of this man
Friday to his master. Now Sir
Roger is In Germany as an exile.
Exactly why he went to Germany
was never told and the following Is
nn extract given to the American
correspondent at Berlin:
In June, 1913, I resigned from
tho British Consular service on the
ground of ill health, my intention
being to go to South Africa, where
both cllmato and surroundings were
congenial. Unhappily tho political
condition of Ireland claimed consid
eration at tho hands of an Irishman
who had always been something more
than a home ruler in feeling, al
though he had never taken active
part in politics.
My views as an Irish Nationalist
of this typo were well known in the
Foreign OAtce, and in England as
much as in Ireland, for I never made
any concealment of them, I had
stated them openly on many oc
rnRlnnn In t.ho nress and they were
L&MMJSariMflMlfttl
tuny as to my own irienas.
Preparatory as I thought to going
out to tho Capo for a period of re
pose and quiet, within which to place
on Tecord my African and Amazon
experiences in tho field of tropical
research, I visited Ireland in August,
1913, to pay, as I thought, some
farewell visits. As matters turned
out I found it very hard to leave Ire
land. Tho Carson campaign in
Ulster was in full blast, and despite
an innate and over recurring desire
for retirement T found myself over
borne by tho solicitations of my
friends to stay at home, for a time
at any rate, and in Ulster, where I
was most at home, to try to keep
tho small band of "scattered Prot
estants" there who desired friend
ship with thoir Catholic fellow
countrymen, based on an equal rec
ognition of their common Irish
Identity, against which tho forces of
Intolerance and enmity wero openly
arrayed. In November of that year
came tho establishment of the Irish
Volunteers at Dublin. Tho Irish
Volunteers sought to do for all Ire
land what the Ulster Volunteers
sought for Ulster Protestantism
alone to defend tho rights and liber
ties common to a whole people,
Protestant and Catholic. I Joined
Prof. McNeill and became a member
of the governing body of tho volun
teers, and with him addressed the
first meetings held, after tho in
augural Dublin meeting, in Galway
nnd f!nrk. In December. 1913. An
incident at this time occurred that
added weight to the conviction I
already held that no English Gov
ernment, whether it called itself
-Whig or Tory, was capable of treat
ing Ireland with Justice. I refer to
the abandonment of the port of
Queonstown by the largo Cunard
vessels on the alleged ground of its
dangerous character, and tho subse
quent action taken against tho Hamburg-American
Lino, which had ari
nounced its Intention to call at
Queenstown en route to Boston.
This latter action was an unfriendly
act to Ireland and was accom
plished by an underhand diplomacy
that would have been unfriendly to a
forolgn State, much moro so to an
Integral part" of the realm effecting
It. Throughout tho spring and early
summer of 1914 tho Volunteer
movement In Ireland spread. In
every county thousands of men were
enrolling and drilling and every
where tho cry was "when Bhall wo
get the rifles?"
At a personal interview with Mr.
Redmond, May 7, 1914. ho stated
that tho last thing he desired was
that rifles snouia do iut m i
hands of the volunteers. At tho
same meeting it became clear to
Prof. McNeill and myself that tho
Irish Parliamentary party meant to
"capture" tho volunteers and to use
them as a sham army for political,
purposes on English party plat
forms. When It was clear that all
treland was behind tho volunteer
uprisal Redmond sought to lay
hands upon it, so that it might be
deflected from Its original Irish
nnrnnu. A sDontaneous national
upheaval of Irish patriotism was to
W useo, ior purpu ui oujiuu v
ItUeal triokery. To meet this scheme
ft was only necessary to do one
thing to arm the Irish Volunteer,
even as Sir Edward Carson had
armed the Ulster Volunteers. After
making arrangements to have a
first consignment of arms landed In
Ireland I went to America, in order
to complete tho work of obtaining
the financial support of Irish Na
tionalists there to get arms, Just as
the Ulster movement had obtained
Its armed support from tho anti
Irish elements of England.
I left Ireland in tho beginning of
July, 1914 (when war was never
dreamed of), and toward tho end
of that month I addressed meetings
of Irishmen in Norfolk and in
Philadelphia. The latter mooting
synchronized with the successful
landing at Howth of the rifles my
friends had bought abroad, and
which led to the firing by the
British garrison upon tho people of
Dublin on that Sunday afternoon.
Wero further proofs needed of tho
unchanged and unchanging de
termination of all British Govern
ments to treat Ireland as a con
quered province this outrageous
military assault of July 2G on the
Inhabitants of Dublin furnished
them.
Then came the war. On August
4 the British Government declared
war on Germany, the pretext having
been carefully arranged beforehand.
Germany had never injured Eng
land, much less Ireland, and It was
plain that she was being attacked
not for the wrong she had done us
or others, but from tho hope others
held of doing Injury to her. Ire
land was being appealed to by ev
ery agency of fear, of resentment,
of misplaced chivalry to send hun
dreds of thousands of her men to
a fight that at tho best concerned
her not at all.
I hoped that the German Govern
ment might be induced to make
clear" its peaceful intentions toward
Ireland and that tho effect of such
a pronouncement In Ireland itself
might bo powerful to keep Irishmen
trom volunteering for a war that
had no claim upon their patriotism
or their honor. With this aim
chiefly in view, I came to Germany
In November, 1914, and I succeeded
in the object I had set before my
self. The German Government de
clared openly its good will toward
Ireland. The rest of my stay In
Germany was and is but tho neces
sary outcome of that initial act.
I sought, so far as one man
could achieve it, to keep my own
people free from participation in a
great wrong. Hatred to England or
Englishmen I had none; my hope
in coming to Germany was that I
might be tho means to some extent
of keeping Ireland's sons in peace
at home and whoever helped in
any measure to do that would do a
better thing, I know, than help to
fill a million graves.

CONTEMPTIFOR THE PRESIDENT
That England has little friend
ship for this country has become
auitenpparent, notonlvthrougi

but because she stands against the.
United States and all sho does ex
cept furnishing the Allies war
munitions. Tho hostile feeling pre
vailing in London is thus described
In dispatches to the Chicago Tri
bune: It is not the most prudent thing
theso days to flaunt in London's
face the fact that you are an Ameri
can. Tho average Britisher, moro
particularly tho Londoner, usually
cold and reserved, in restaurants
and clubs, on tramcars and omni
buses and most everywhere, has
reached tho stage where ho will drop
his reservo any time to open an
argument with an American regard
ing President Wilson's submarine
war policy. An introduction , isn't
necessary. Many Americans in Eng
land who slnco tho war started
have worn small American flags on
their coats have abandoned the
practice of late. It is not because
they aren't patriotic or have lost re
gard for tho Stars and Stripes. It
is because theso submarine debates
aro becoming warmer and warmer.
Tho Britisher is demanding to
know what President Wilson "is go
ing to do about the latest submarlno
outrage; is he going to send another
note, and if so when; do Americans
generally think that diplomatic
notes that novor return 'full satis
faction' should be tho only redress
for flagrant violation of Interna
tional law on tho high seas, and
whether " so on and so on and so
on. When Austria answered Presi
dent Wilson's second note on the
Ancona sinking and practically
bowed to the President's demands
the tension slackened. The respite
was brief. Tho destruction of the
liner Persia in tho Mediterranean
revived the argument, and in conse
quence the American in England
nowadays isn't advertising tho fact
that he's an American.
An American business man who
camo to England less than a year
ago to take charge of an established
American branch In London, said
Saturday: "I have worn a small
metallic emblem of the Stars and
Stripes on my coat lapel over since
t stepped off a liner at Liverpool. I
am proud to be an American, and I
am not -going to hide that flag. But
r must admit that at present it is
hurting my business. Prospective
customers insist on arguing about
President Wilson's submarine war
policy before they will consent to
discuss business affairs. Some of
(hem become indignant and their
manner turns indifferent to Ameri
cans and American industry. They
refuso to buy. To declare war on
Germany or Austria would bo harm
ful, speaking from an unneutral
viewpoint, to the cause of tho Allies;
t would diminish the steady stream
of munitions coming to them from
tho United States; it could not help
them much In a military way."
Other Americans In London
I frankly admitted that they are find-
ing moir position iiHruer uu imiuoi.
Sometimes the defense of America's
policy regarding submarine war
lapses into a discussion of Presi
dent Wilson'a note on England's
blockade policy which makes the
argument more unpleasant., A few
Americans have denounced the aets
of official Washington and will argue

called on Ambassador Page recently
to tell the Ambassadorfthat he was
"ashamed of his country"
"It's quite mutual," promptly re
torted Page, and the 1 itcrvlow was

and tho anti-Wilson Americans never
fall In their debates tofrmention the
President's phrase about being "too

it is reliably roported .that this part
of tho debate was quiclcly over. The

Charles E. McDonnell, Bishop of
Brooklyn, by whom Archbishop
Mundelein was ordained into the
priesthood, and scores of other

Archbishop Mundelein, who is
forty-three years old, is tho young
est priest ever to bo Intrusted with
an archdiocese of the Importance of
Chicago. Ho was born in Brooklyn
and finished his preliminary educa
tion in Manhattan College, N. Y.,
in 1889, being tho youngest man to
whom this collego over granted a
degree. He began his theological
course at tho Propaganda Fide In
Rome in 1890 and was ordained
Into tho priesthood In 1895. In
1907 he was selected as a member
of the Ancient Academy of ArcadI-
the only man In the United States
upon whom this honor ever was
conferred. He assumes on behalf
of tho Bishopric tho ownership of
property wdrth approximately
$50,000,000 and is ecclesiastic ruler
of a Roman Catholic community of
1,400,000 people.
Recognition of tho imporatneo of
tho responsibility assumed by Arch
bishop Mundelein with tho pallium,
tho symbol of his sacordotal office,
was contained in his address after
the service was completed. "As 1
look over my experience and think
of the vast army of children tho
poor, tho sick, the orphaned and tho
destitute," said the Archbishop, "I
think of tho work that is to bo done
in an archdiocese like Chicago. You
must be generous in your sympathy,
generous in your devotion; stay
with me always, good times and
bad. We must all stand as one

To tho priests ho said: "Whether

THE CRY
For Religions Education and

Not Alone From CotholIeSourccs

Many Places Demand Religious

"Tho necessity of religious educa

training of the young. But now it
Is not alono from Catholic sources
that Its itoration comes. Others
havo learned that there must bo a
training of tho whole man, that
there must be a strengthening of
his spiritual as well as his physical
and intellectual life. And so wo
hear from many places at the pres
ent day this demand for a religious
education of tho nation's youth. Tho
Now Church Review is another re
cruit to tho ranks of those who aro
asking that our education give some
thought to tho spiritual. In its
Janunry issuo thero appears an
articlo on "Religious Education in
tho Public Schools" which is a most
Interesting contribution on this sub
ject, as much by reason of what it
Incorrectly as well as that which it
correctly says. It emphasizes the
necessity of "a training of the
heart" as well as "a training of
head and hand." "To complete the
trinity of activities it remains to
find means for right training of tho
heart for that kind of training
which results in character based on
principle, actuated by lovo of right.
Without such character tho in
dividual is like a pieco of machinery
out of gear, and society mado up of
such individuals suffers consequent
disorders and discords."
To all of which hearty assent can
certainly bo given. The spiritual
faculty of man does decidedly need
training and development. "When
all of the faculties of tho human be
ing," we1 aro further Informed, "are
In their right adjustment, tho life
of tho individual runs smoothly;
and society approaches the ideal In
proportion as this adjustment in tho
Individual lives prevails. It is by the
centralizing of all tho motives of
conduct in obedience to tho Dlvlno
commandments that this adjustment
Is accomplished, even as it is by
tho operation of the immutable law
of gravitation that all tho forces of
nature are held In equilibrium." "It
is much to bo desired," wo learn,
"that our public schools be made
effective in tho development of char
acter, as well as in tho training of
tho intellect, that charaetcr-building
take tho place in the school cur
riculum which its importance de
mands." It js hero that the stum
bling In tho argument begins. Our
religious education is npt to bo tho
education that wo generally under
stand it to bo in the use of that
term. It is to be that "deeper con
ception of a personal religion which
In tho past has produced so many
saintly characters plus an educa
tion that has reference to tho whole
human race, in its ontiro rango of
Interrelated necessities and obliga
tions, and that looks upon each in
dividual as vitally realted to tho
whole." "It is much to be desired
that thero be prepared a book of
selections from tho Scriptures, ac
ceptable to Protestant, Roman Cath
olic and Jew, as sultablo for reading
in the schopls, and that the daily
reading of portions of It without
comment bo prescribed. It is im
possible to estimate the benefits that
would follow from such a daily ex
ercise, especially it tho teacher were
In sympathy with It. The singing
of hymns expressive of love, grati
tude and worship may be a power
ful factor in the development of
that religious susceptibility without
which religious Instruction la Inefficient."
Unhappily for all, this form of
effort is not religious training. It
is but a poor, weak imitation of
that education which will really
produce tho great benefits deslrca
and which have been prognosticated.
Mere reading from tho Scriptures
and tho singing of hymns will not
develop the spiritual fiber of the
growing child. It will not give to
his will that Impress which will
powerfully nsslst It in keeping In
the way of right and proper action.'
The teachings of Marcus Aurelius
and Epictetus failed to produce a
vital effect upon tho lives of the
people because of this lack of a
compelling supernatural force. For
proper religious training wo must
mold tho will of the individual, give
to him that strengthening vital
power that will onablo him to carry
Into practlco tho "thou shalt nots"
of tho commandments. To accom
plish this both instructor and in
structed must tsver vividly realize
that such commands are of a Dlvlno
origin, tho essonce of a moral law
God-ordalned. Only In training car
ried on in the light of such a reali
zation can the individual be said to
be truly "religiously" educated.

DEMOCRATS
Gratficd At Withdrawal or the
Proposed Liquor Commis
sion Bill.
Measure Would Have Meant
Creation of Monstrous Poli
tical Machine.
Col. Jim Whallcn Tells of Pro
posed Attempt Against
Organization.
LAWTON TO OPPOSE SHERLEY
Democrats throughout the Stato
were up in arms this week at the
proposed Excise Commission bill
which, if passed by tho Legislature,
would havo paved tho way for the
creation of a monstrous machine
and sure destruction of tho Demo
cratic party in this State. It would
havo created a constant turmoil
among tho liquor dealers in the
State, as tho party In power would
wreak vengeance on any saloon
keeper not willing to do tho bidding
of tho machine. Tho Republicans,
if in power, could persecute tho
Democrats, and the latter when In
power could persecute tho Republi
cans. Asido from this tho party in
power could also browbeat saloon
men and liquor dealers into accept
ing the candidates of the machine
in a primary. All in all, thero was
not ono redeeming feature in tho
measuro and Democrats aro at a
loss to see why Gov. Stanley and his
advisers were ever bamboozled for
ono minute into giving support to
such a measure. It is rumored but
not confirmed that Gov. Stanloy was
influenced by tho llttlo coterie of
down and out politicians in Louis
ville who seek this method of
wreaking vengeance on tho present
leaders of tho Democratic party, de
spite tho fact that it is ack
nowledged and conceded that the
prcsont leaders took chargo of the
organization just when tho above
down and outers had practically
ruined the party here, and their tac
tics, whilo in power, made ono
ashamed to acknowledge that he
was n Democrat.
Col. James P. Whallen summed
up tho caso pretty thoroughly from
tho standpoint of Louisville and Jef
ferson county In an interview tho
Louisville recently that, if the
Democrats of Louisville would not
surrender their principles and sup
port such a measuro as this, an
attempt would bo made at tho next
State convention, by the vote of
Kentucky Satto Democrats, to wipe
out tho legally-elected Democratic
committee in Louisville and create
a party committee that would favor
plans for creating this liquor ma
chine. That is something for the
Democrats of Kentucky to consider.
I know that tho Democrats of this
Stato understand tho great improve
ments that havo been mado in
Louisville in city govornmont. It is
a reflection upon them to stato that
they would punish Louisville for re
fusing to support such a revolution
ary proposal as this. They know
that the Democrats of Louisville
aro tho persons to olect their own
party committees, and I do not bo
llovo tho Stato convention would
seriously consider a resolution to
abolish that kind of homo rule."
Tho local Republicans aro now
casting about for Congressional tim
ber for tho fall election In this dis
trict, and seem to havo narrowed
down tho list of choices to three
William Hoyburn, Joo Lawton and
Dr. Ben Bruner but tho latter will
probably bo eliminated because of
his prohibition views, and in that
event Lawton, having tho backing
of Searcy and Chilton, tho present
powers that be, will receive tho Re
publican nomination. As predicted
bofore. Congressman Swagar Sher
ley will havo no opposition for tho
Democratic nomination. It is
rumored that the friends of Judge
Gregory and Judge Greeno aro try
ing to persuade- them to enter tho
race, but it is pretty near a cer
tainty that County Judgo Greeno is
grooming himself for tho Mayoralty
nomination next year.
ilong with tho Congressional
race this year threo members of tho
Board of Education will ho chosen,
and judging from the present dis
satisfaction with tho conduct of tho
present board thero will bo several
strong aspirants in the Hold. Tho
attempt of tho board to prevent tax
payers from receiving a discount on
the school share of the tax wa3 tho
crowning blow, and an attempt of
tho few, who poso as good govern
ment representatives, to tell tho
public whom they may vote for will
meet with a cool reception this year.
