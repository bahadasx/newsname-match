NEW CHILD LABOR
BILL PASSES HOUSE
PRODUCTION OF THEIR HANDS
ARE BARRED FROM INTER
STATE COMMERCE.
\Vashlington. The- Keating bill,
ta rring from interstate (coimnterce the
produllcts of child labor. rwa.- passed
by the Iloust. 3; to 46. and now goes
to the Senate. It imposes heavy pe'n
ilties for Interstate shlliplient of any
connmmodity made in whole or in part
by children under 16. working in mines
or quarriets, or by children under 14
working in mills. canneries, work
shops or manufacturing establish
nents. Where children are employ .-a
at night or more than eight hours a
day in this latter class of industries
the minimum age is 1t; Instead of II.
The only material change made to
the measure was Iby the adoption of
an amendment exempting the boys
and girls canning clubs.
The House spent the entire day de
bating the bill. Opposition came
largely from the South. Representa
tive Webb of North Carolina. chair
man of the House judiciary commit
tee. urged that it was unconstitutional,
andl soulght unsuccessfully to exempt
sthe children of widows from its opera
tions. He also endeavored to have It I
applied to the tenement houses of
New York and Boston.
Representatives Sears of Florida
sought unsuccessfully to amend the
nmeasure so as to leave its enforce
ment to I'nited States marshals and
not to special inspectors of the De
partment of Labor, while former
Speaker Cannon offered an amendment I
to exempt canneries. because of the
competition of canneries across the
border in Canada. Representative
Dallinger of Massachusetts wanted
carriers made liable for transportin.
child labor products. He was willing
to protect the carriers by providing
that shippers should file affidavits as
to the production.
The amendment to exempt the boys'
and girls' canning clubs from the ope
ration of the law was first proposedl
by Representative (Clark of Florida.
Congressman Keating. author of the
bill, contended that the measure would
not be construed as applying to suci
organizations, and pleaded against
any loopholes being left for violation
of the law.
