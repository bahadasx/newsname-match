For Rheumatism.
As soon as an attack of rheumatism
begins apply Sloan's Liniment. Don't
waste time and suffer unnecessary
agony. A few drops of Sloan's Lini
ment on the affected parts is all you
need. The pain goes at once.
A grateful sufferer writes: "I was
suffering for three weeks with Chronic
Rheumatism and stiff neck, although
I tried many medicines tney failed, and
I was under the care of a doctor. For
tunately I heard of Sloan's Liniment
and after using it three or four days
am up and well. I am employed at
the biggest department store in S.P.
where they employ from six to eight
hundred bnds, and they surely will
bear all about Sloan's Linimet . H. B.
