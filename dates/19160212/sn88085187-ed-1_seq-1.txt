fOPEN PEOPLE'S FIGHT ON BOSSES AND SPECIAL INTERESTS
Four great steps which the state of Wash
,• ington msy take toward a more democratic
and equitable government and an improve
ment of Its citizenship stand this Lincoln's
birthday inviting YOU, Mr. Voter.
Bach of these steps Is embodied In an inltl-
I atlve bill which you will have an opportunity
(If you are registered) to sign in the near
future, and for which, at the fall election, you
will have the opportunity to vote.
Maybe Sir William Robertson,
K. C, V. 0., K. C. B. and D. S. 0.,
rose from the ranks, as reported,
but it sounds as if he rose from the
alphabet.

The winter buttle in the Cliatn-
Ipagne has ben (ought, nnd for tis
I Germans it has
been carried to a
victorious finale.
In these days of
ours, when the
whole world has
come together in
terrible warfare,
tiic wheel of his
tory is turning
with unusual ra
pidity. New bat
tles, new victor
ies push the
earlier ones into
the background,
and it is only
human nature
that the brilliant
accomplishments
of ever-continu
ing war, with its
incredibly gigan
tic results, draw
all eyes to them
selves and put In
the shadow the
Princo Oscar, heroic deeds
Which, carried through with no
such visible results, were accom
plished in the battles of the
Champagne.
The Past is already weaving
her veil, ahd in her steps follows
very closely her sister, Forgetful -
neßs. But we may not, we must
not forget! Not only because the
Champagne battle was the greatest
and most lasting offensive battle
that history has so far known,
and because our weapons led to
victory; not only in thankfulness
to our brave leader and his troops
who did the impossible, who suf
fered beyond description, and
still finally conquered; one other
thing calls to us not to forget. It
Is our many, many brave dead,
who, in unsurpassed self dental
and from the truest sense of
duty, gave their lives for kaiser
and country, for home and kins
men.
As children we have stood be
fore some mound-like grave,
where rested an unknown hero
of long ago. Hill I ■»« north of
l,c itlesnll in the Champagne Is
such v grave.
In order to realize the full
significance of the battle of
the Champagne, in order to
understand the mammoth
grandeur of the accomplish
ments of our brave troops,
ne must ask the question,
"What did tlie battle In the
Champagne really mean—
WHEREIN DOES THE
GREATNESS OF OIK VIC
TORY LlE'."'
These questions ran be an
swered In a few words. It

What Would Lincoln Do?
Here's Exactly What He
Did Bn Mexican Turmoil
What would Lincoln dol How would be rote
on tlif questions of preparedness and Interven
tion in Mexico 1
Timet readers, who have w»nl in their votes,
havo decided by • big majority thai Lincoln
would have stood against intervention. The
score was 211 to 40.
On the question of prepav(K.:esf. the vote was
almost equally divided, Tyt Lincoln would
have stood out against groat; y preparedness the
opinion of K»*{ readers, whik 121 voted '•yes."
But there was one man wl o decided the ques
tion by showing WHAT LINCOLN ACTUAL
LY nil).
lie is Walter L. Davis, professor of history at
the College of Pngei Sound. In a priceless old
government document primed in 18(82 be has
dug up the actual record of Lincoln's attitude
toward the southern republic.
It shows thai The Times readers voted correctly, at least in s<> far as
the question of Intervention is concerned.
#*#•*»
Patient, determined, holding the reins of a government] torn by In
ternal strife, the great master American in 1861 raced a situation in
Mexico almost exactly similar to thai which confronts OUT government
today.
Revolution and outl-iwry bad followed in the heels of American ag
gression in Mexico during President Polk's administration 18 years be
fore. For four years the country to the south had been torn by a bloody
conflict between a republic and a monarchy lor supremacy.
Immediately after Lincoln took office came the word that the provis
onal government of President Benito Juarez, "the Washington of Mexi
co,'' had been victorious and had established itself at the capital.
Yet on top of this followed reports that the provisionel government
was without authority to maintain order. Stories of robberies, murders
and other cruelties against American citizens came flooding iv to Wash
ington.
And to cap the climax the news was received that a member of the
American legation had been murdered on his way from Mexico City to
Vera Cruz!
t
What did Lincoln do in this crisis?
lie sat tight and enforced the doctrine of watchful waiting and for
bearance! He proclaimed a new policy, opposed to aggression, in the
handling of Mexican affairs by appointing as minister to that country the
very man who had bitterly opposed American interference 15 years be
fore.
And through Secretary Seward he issued the following careful in
structions to this minister:
"For a few years past the condition of Mexico has been so unsettled as to raise the ques
tion on both sides of the Atlantic whether the time has not come when some foreign power
ought, In the general Interest of society, to intervene to establish a protectorate or some other
form of government in that country and guarantee its continuance there.
"You will not fail to assure the government of Mexico that Hie president neither has, nor
can ever have, any sympathy with such designs, in whatever quarter they may arise or what
ever character they may take on."
a • • •
"The president never for a moment doubts that the republican system Is to pass safely
through till ordeals and prove a permanent success in our own country, and so to be recom
mended to adoption by all other nations.
"But he thinks also that that system everywhere has to make its way painfully through
difficulties and embarrassements which result from the action of antagonlstical elements which
are a legacy of former times and very different institutions.
"The president is hopeful of the liltimate triumph of this system over all obstacles, as well
in regard to Mexico as In regard to every othet American state; hut he feels that tho«*e slutes
are nevertheless justly entitled to a greater forbearance and more generous symiiathies from
the government and people of tlie I'nlted Slates than they are likely to receive in any other
«iuarter."
• * * *
"The president trusts that your mission, manifesting these sentiments, will reassure the gov
ernment of Mexico of his best disposition to favor their commerce and their internal improve
ments.
. . . .
"I find the archives here full of complaints against the Mexican government for violation
of contracts and spoliation and cruelties practiced against American citizens. It is not the presi
dent's intention to send forward such claims at the presnt moment. He willingly defers the per
formance of a duty which at any time wouM seem ungracious, until the Incoming administra
tion in Mexico shall have had time, if possible, to cement its authority.

S- A first aid bill. This is similar to
one that nearly passed two years ago. It
provides for adnilnlstration of first aid
