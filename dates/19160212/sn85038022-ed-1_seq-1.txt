Tho Ulcrbowcr building, tho present
home of tho Cllbson Garment Com
pany, on East Second street, is rapid
ly nssuming tho nppcaranco of a full
fledged factory. On tho third floor,
which has been refitted and mado over,
nro loeate'd the machines for making
different kinds of garments manufac
tured by the Gibson people They
make drawers, middles, wnsh sklrtB,
house dresses, aprons and kimonos.
At present thero nro about twenty
(Ivo girls ut work and nil work Is
paid for by tho pleco or lot. The
machines nro tho Union Special and
Singer sewing machines of the latest
Improved pnttcrns. When you sco a
machine doing tlirco tucks at n time,
hemming and trimming edges at ono
operation, a buttonholo machine cut
ting the buttonholo nnd working It nt
tho same time, you ceaso to wonder
nt tho low price tho garments can be
gold for.
It takes patience and time for a girl
to learn how to operato her machine,
nnd when she does learn how to op
ornte the machine she will cam from
$8 to $12 per week.
This department Is in charge o
Mrs. Mario Myers, forclady. Mrs
Myers Is one of tho best In her line
of work in the United States.
On the second floor arc the offlce
and cutting rooms. When you see
from 100 to COO layers of muslin ox
tending forty feet in length, and the
patterns marked off, then nn electric
cutter goes thftnigh this, cutting out
from 1,200 to 4,000 garments in an
hour's time, you again get some idea
of the low cost of manufacturing the
articles we buy. Mr. M. Gordon Is
foreman In this department.
Over all Is the president and general
manager, Mr. M. Fischer. In a short
time, just as soon as tho rooms can
be arranged, tho Gibson people ex

Tho rooms are sanitary, well lighted
