Alleginir that the management of
the American. Graphophone Co.-- had
' broken faith and ita agreement with
them made after the strike last fall,
practically all the employes of the fac
tory refuged to work today.. Although
officials of the company declared the
factory was running short-handed the
employes said thathone but the fore
men was in the shop and no produc
tion was beinsr carried oil. .-.-
Yesterday noon employes on leaving
the factory saw a notice which said
'that the company does i6t recognize
Lincoln's birthday or. Washington's
birthday as holidays within the mean
ing of, the agreement with the em
ployes,' and that the regular time only
would be, paid for those days, and the
factory, would run as usual. After the
' notice was read an indignation meet
ing was held ' during the noon hour.
jVn attempt was made by some of the
employes tO see George Hanson, works
manager of the factory. He could not
be found, and then the employes
agreed that no one -would report for
duty today. .. v
.A - number of those who did- not
know about the vote reported. ' Some
t of those who had voied to stay, out
were at' the entrances of the-,Tactory
eprly this morning to watch those wher
went in. ;,They said that the men "who
reported' for work left the factory as
eon. as they saw the majority did not
intend to work:. Only the foremen re
mained, it is 'claimed.
It is said that the company inten8
o recognize the" holidays on which .it
- has been accustomed to close the fac
tory such as Memorial fay Fourth of
July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving and
Chrlrjmas. t.-i&m-ewnins-withm - h
meaning of their .agreement with the
men for double time on holidays. Oth
er factories; in the West End were clos
ed with the exception of the American
Tube & Stamping Go. The employes
there - have no agreement for extra
time on ; holidays.
-Herbert A- Budlong, assistant man
ager of ' the American . Graphophone
Co. said today: .
, "It is true that we post d a notice
.-' savin? that our factory would run
today and on- Washington's birthday.
It is also true that li large nuraoer
of our employes did hot. report for
work today but our factory is running
'as usual 'and will run on Washing-
- ton's birthday."
' The Bryant Electric Co. closed , its
plant for the .day as did the Harvey
- Hubbell Co.':, The office , force was
emnloyed as usual. : Both factories
have an agreement . with their, em
ployes to. pay time an a - half foi-
holiday. ' At both factories It was
said that most of the employes pre
ferred: the holiday rather than work,
and so the management thought best
to close -',-'-
At the Siemon Hard Rubber Co.
factory, the shop committee waited on
Carl F. Siemon, the president, - and
asked that the factory close. Mr.
Siemon explained that the concern
has so many orders that it would not
. be policy to -close. A number of the
employes, .stayed out today, preferring
the -.holiday to the time and a half
wages they would be entitled td if they
worked. . v ' - - '
The Columbia Nut & Bolt Co. was
. working, as usual. All employes will
receive double time. . . ,
At the Remington Anna & Ammu
nition Co. and at the factory of the
Union Metallic Cartridge Co. it was
said that the companies did not con

their agreement with their employes.
The agreement made with the striking
employes some time ago is that the
factory shall close on New Tear's,
Washington's : Birthday, Memorial
Iay, Fourth of July, Labor Day,
8hanksgiving and Christmas. If the
factories work these days time and a
half is to be paid the employes.
. It was said, however, that at pres
ent it is theintention of the manage
ment to grant the holidays by closing.
. Warner ' Bros. Co. was running as
usual. John -W. Field, superintendent
. of the factory, said that all employes
, had reported for work. He said the
management had not considered clos
ing today or Washington's Birthday.
He said the company had made no
agreement to pay its employes extra
compensation for labor on holidays.

Local, Arms ' Plant Adopts
Unique Plan For Conduct-;"
ing Department.
i.
It is reported today that for the
first- time in Bridgeport an office or
semi-orBce force will be put on the
three-shift plan. This innovation will
begin Monday next in the auditor's
department of ,the Remington Arms
& Ammunition Co. where the pay roll
force "of about 110 men will be di
vided into three shifts of 35 each,
working one shift for a period of one
week each.
Under the new plan the' force which
has heretofore worked from 8- a. m:
to 5 p. m. will be divided and here
after will shift as follows: First shift
from 7 a. m. . to 3:30 p. m. ; second
shift from 3:30 to - midnight; third
shift from midnight until 7 a. m.
It is further reported from authen
tic sources that during- the last week
10 fully completed rifles have been
turned over to the inspection .of offi
cials of the company. These 10 rifles
are the first complete instruments that
have been turned out and are looked
upon theoretically to represent a cost
of nearly one million dollars each,
though actually the work upon pre
paring parts for millions of guns has
gone merrily onward end when actual
production begins they will be turned
out by the thousands daily.
It is understood that the contracts
obtained by the Remington Arms '&
Ammunition Co. do not call for first
deliveries until May and by that time
it is known that the educational per
iod needed to instruct workers in the
operation of machines and the actual
production of efficient weapons of
warfarewill have been passed and this
country will have more workers upon
Warfare guns than ever before,
i The production of military rifles is
one of the least known arts in indus
trial America. '

Asks About'Reiease.
County Sheriff Simeon Peale thinks
Frank Carmalino, who recently escap
ed from the county Jail, is still in this
country for he received a letter this
morning from Carmalino's wife,' who
is in. Italy. i ne woman wanted to
know when het-iiusband would be re
leased. She said she had heard noth
ing from him recently. This letter
casts doubt on the story that Carmali
no, sailed from Canada over a month
ago and wrote a letter from the ship
mocking the local authorities If
Carmalino had gone1 abroad he would
surely have leachedhis home in Italy
by this time.
Since Carmalino and Albert Martin
of this city escaped from the jail no
trace has been found of either. -Police
all over the country have been
furnished descriptions of the pair.how
ever, and . the authorities think they
will eventually be captured.

No heed was paid to the blank shots :

that he was attempting to escape, but

At the offices """of ' the Russian In
formation Bureau in the First-Bridgeport
National Bank building it was
learned today ' that General Czeigler
had returned to his post. He was un
doubtedly a very busy man as when
reporters called there today he was.
engrossed in listening to at least five
lieutenants, 'some of which are able
to speak German fluently.
.. An attempt to obtain an interview
was frustrated i by his, subordinates ;
who saw., to it that his private office ,
was immediately closed and explain- ;
ed politely that the general was en- i
gaged upon "business of a private na- j
ture." .
The recent publication of articles
bearing on the general and his pres
ent .business . in . Bridgeport was de
precated -by staff members of the of
fice. "' r
An attempt-to reach Colonel Colo
toff at. the Remington Arms & 'Ai-.
munition Co.. ;.was. .nearly.-, successful ,
through the negotiation of .his private
secretary who said that but or the
presence of the French and -Russian ,
fcommission, at that time in the. plant
and engaging the time of Colonel Col
lotoff, he would have procured an in
terview with the colonel.
It was admitted at the - Remington
Arms plant by the official Russian in-:
terpreter. that General Czeigler was
"highly, connected"- in Russian, gov
ernment circles . but noi information
would, 'be vouchsafed as to his busi
ness or mission, that has required a
large office in Bridgeport. All inspec
tion of arms and ammunition here,
however, it was said, is done by thosa
stationed in the munition works here.
No signs have yet appeared on tho
doorways of the offices in rooms 716,
717 and 718 on the seventh floor of the
bank building, attendants 'of which
say that hundreds of persons visit the
offices in the course of a -week.
WOULD-BE ST7ICTDE BETTER.
An improvement has been noticed 1
the condition off Mrs. Annie E. Carsoi ;
by the attendants at the Bridgeport
hospital where she is confined. Mrs.
C.arson attempted to end her life by
cutting her throat with her husband's
wazor. She will probably recover.
