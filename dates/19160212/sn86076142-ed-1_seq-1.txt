bate became general and Involved the

most persistent In his opposition, con
tending that the grant was too law.
the minimum price too small and the
conditions of the bill too liberal, that
Nevada waB being more generously
treated than the other states.
Senator Polndexter urged an amend
ment cutting the grant down to three
million acres. The amendment was
lost. He then offered an amendment
reducing the grant to four millions.
The amendment was lost. Senator
Lafollette urged ihom intensely his
amendment to prohibit the sale of the
state of any of the, land for twenty
five years. This amendment was lost
after an Impassioned attack by Sena
tor Pltlman and a convincing argu
ment by Senator New-lands.
Senator Lefollelte then offered ai
amendment fixing the minimum piles
at three dollars per acre.
Senator Plttihan answered this by
calling attention to a provision for
appraisement by a state board and
urged that the people of the stato
know more of the value of the land
than the senator from Wisconsin or
Utah and that no one dare queston
their Integrity.
The new poiindmaRter actively en
tered upon his duties this 'morning,
but he found that the muzzling ordin
ance was so well observed that he
captured only one lonesome dog.
The ordinance requiring the pay
ment of dog license has also been put
into eff-ct, after being honored in the
