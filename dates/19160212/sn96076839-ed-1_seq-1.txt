Spencer Block
Badly Burned
Roof . and Second Floor Destroy
ed by Fire, Monday.
23ie Spencer Block was badly gutted
brire Monday afternoon, in a blaze
which taxed ourvfire department to its
utmost to keep it from destroying the
entire structure.
The fire originated near" the roof of
the back part and an alarm was turned
in. The fire department responded
promptly and an effort was made to ex
tinguish the blaze with chemicals. The
building is oonstructed mainly of pine,
and this, coupled with the fire being
just under the roof and almost inacces
sible, made hard work for the fireman.
Water was brought into play, and this
held the fire from going below the
second story.
The store buildings were occupied
by George Spencer with his plumbing
shop and electrical supplies, and by
the Blount Bazaar Store. The second
floor was divided into apartments,
George Spencer, with his mother and
-family occupying a part, and the
Afamilies of Jesse Simmons and Walter
Petrie the other apartments. Owing
to the dense smoke caused by the
burning pine, it was impossible to save
any of the household furnishings from
the second floor and these are badly
Injured by the water and smoke. Some
of the contents of Mr. Spencer's shop
were removed, but the remainder of
this stock together with that of Blount's
Bazaar were soaked with the falling
water.
Mr. Spencer carried fire insurance
on the building and the contents own
ed by him, and Blount's Bazaar was
insured.

There was a man in our town,
Who was not very wise,
He went to buy his wife a belt, -
But he did not know the size.
, And when he took it home to her,
' fyou should have heard the kicks,
Hv waist was eighteen inches 'round,
The belt was thirty -six!

tion to Act No. 270 of the public acts of
1915, relative to elections, which pro
vides that all caucuses and nominating
conventions shall be held at least
twenty days prior to the regular elec
tion. Also that the ballots for any
general or primary election, shall be on
file with the county or city clerk, as
the case may be, at least twelve days
prior to said election. This means that
all nominating petitions must be filed
with the city clerk not later than Satur.

the printer two days in which to pre

Wise and Otherwise
Whiskey straight makes crooked
paths.
When you think a girl's a peach you
don't need sugar and cream to smack
your lips over her.
What would be the basest crime in
time of peace is the highest exempli
fication of patriotism in time of war.
You, young man, just fresh from col
lege, don't make fun of your old dad's
lack of learning. Think of the good
judgement he used in picking out a
mother for you.

ELBERT BEDE SAYS
The anti-militarists seems to have
overlooked the Salvation Army.
The secret ballot will soon be a back
number with women becoming voters.
Perpetual motion has been found at
last. The man who discovered it has
a wife and twelve daughters.
The candidate thinks more about
good roads when he wants to pave his
way into office than he does afterwards
If the war in Europe continues an
other couple of years, disarmarent will
become mighty popular with the tax
payers over there.
It is proposed to have congress in
continuous session and this just as
several noted preachers were claiming
the world was getting better.
The man who said there is no connec
tion between poqerty and crime must
be right. There are many times more
bankers in jail than newspaper men.
The wholesale price of steel bars has
dropped, so it is said, and the economi
cal housekeeper will see that she gets
the benefit when doing the family
shopping.
The chief objection to our banking
system is that the man who hasn't any
irioney can't get any, while the man
who has plenty of it can always borrow
more.
A former newspaper man is presi
dent of a college. If he imparts to the
students everything he learned as a
newspaper man, some well trained
youny men and women are going to
be turned out into the world.
The fact that a woman is married is
not to bar her from teaching in Oregon.
From experience with her own child
ren the mother should be better quali
fied to act as proxy parent to the child
ren of the neighborhood.
Short and Sweet
Pat"! hear you and the boys struck
for shorter hours. Did you get 'em?"
Mike "Sure. We're not working
at all now."
When a man is in his cups he should
beware of family jars.
Isn't it queer that a man never shows
his temper until after he loses it?

And Along Came Ruth .
"When I open the windows to sweep
the rooms," complained Ruth's aunt
Caroline, "the curtains brush back and
forth and rub up against the screens
and outer sash, and become so soiled
that they are a constant nuisance."
"Just let me tell you an easy way to
avoid that," said Ruth. "Sew snap
fasteners on the inside of each lower
corner of your curtains, and the other
half of the snap about three quarters of
the way up, on the inside also, one on
each side of the curtain. In this way
they can be quickly caught up and held
in place, yet the fasteners will not be
seen by the casual observer."
"Ruth, that head of yours," began
her aunt, "but words fail me!"
Insults and pills are best swallowed
without chewing. '
But the thorn remains long after the
rose has withered.
Promissory notes are in reality noth
ing but paper waits.
Trying to stand on your dignity may
result in a hard fall.
However, the less a man talks, the
more he doesn't have to apologize.
SAVING AT THE SPIGOT
AND WASTING
AT THE BUNGHOLE
There is an economy that saves at
the spigot and wastes at the bunghole.
To practice economy in little things and
forget it in the larger ones is no econo
my at all. To walk a mile in order to
save five cents car fare may not be a
good policy, for the time may be worth
many times the saving. It has been
figured out that it does not pay a car
penter to stoop down to pick up a nail,
for the time he wastes would buy two
nails. You often see men and boys in
the big city dashing in front of autos,
dodging trolley cars and taking desper
ate chances with their lives to save a
few moments time, and then stop for
ten or fifteen minutes to watch some
gentleman in a window advertising a
corn cure. Be consistent!
It never pays to buy something sim
ply because it is cheap. If you do not
need tt, it is dear at any price. The
woman who is eager for bargains and
buys simply because she cannot resist
the temptation to get a bargain has
swindled herself. True value consists
in getting the maximum return for the
money spent.
Last summer a woman bought six
baskets of peaches that were spotted,
and thought she bought them cheap,
and her economical soul was exultant;
but when she found she had fewer
cans than if she had bought sound
fruit, and the scraps were useless for
"peach butter," and in her anxiety to
get them canned before they spoiled
she worked herself sick and let the
syrup boil until it crystallized, she real
ized that there are some bargains that
are not bargains.
When a wave of economy strikes the
household, the wife generally decides
to save on the table, which is all very
well, provided she knows how. But to
buy cheap meats and stale vegetables
may be the poorest sort of economy.
There are some cuts of beef as
nourishing as porterhouse at one-third
less the cost; but to buy bone and
gristle for beef is to deceive yourself.
If the family eats no fat, buy lean cuts.
Pork chops can be had with practically
no fat or bone at all. These are the
loin chops. Rump roast is all meat and
no bone and goes a long way because
there is no waste. In the matter of
clothing costly economy can be prac
ticed. Two pairs of two dollar shoes
will not last half as long as one pair of
four dollar ones. Gingham costs more
than calico, but it wears longer and
looks better. It costs just as much to
make a dress of calieo as of gingham
and the only difference is the small
saving in material cost, which is over
balanced by the short wear. A rem
nant is not cheap unless you can use it.
It may pay a woman to do her own
laundry, but if she breaks her health
it is costly washing. You can ave
money by doing without eating at
least cutting it down to stopping the
craving for food. You can eat candy
just before dinner and not want soup
and meat; but that is saving money to
hire a doctor. True economy does con
sist in doing without some things-
needless luxuries, but not in doing
without the necessities of life. There
are many ways to save, but look out
that in saving at the spigot you don't
forget the bunghole.
The Pessimist Breaks Loose
There is a land of small delight
Where all we mortals dwell,
Where something pesters day and night
And holidays, as well,
Misfortune's ice is spread afar
Whereon each mortal slips;
And those who dodge the mortor car
Appendicitis grips.
While shines the sun man maketh hay
And sunstroke is his gain
He saveta for a rainy day;
And lo it doesn't rain.
The demon corn gnaws at his feet,
Or pain his eye tooth rides,
Or something that he's had to eat
Disturbs his whole insides.
His wife deletes what'ere he's earned
And buyeth hats galore;
And every time his back is turned,
They raise his taxes more
Almost before he gets to bed
.A new day doth commence.
Full oft he'd wish that he were dead
' Except for the expense.
Such is the life we mortals live
A paltry, tiresome task.
All joys are given in a sieve,
Cares in a stoppered fask;
If poor a man is thought a dunce;
If rich, 'tis called a crime.
Good fortune knocks, 'tis said but once;
Hard luck knocks all the time.
He who never does wrong never
does very much, anyway.

FEBRUARY MONTH OF
"RED-LETTER DAYS
("By Observer.")
February, while the shortest month
of the year, certainly holds its own in
number of "red-letter" days days
having some special significance at
tached to them. With an added day
tacked on the rear end, the month this
year also crowds September, April
June and November for length. Over
the United States there are thousands
of people who will this year celebrate
an anniversary of their birth on Feb. .
29th who have not had an opportunity
for doing so for four years.
The first red-letter day of February
was the 2nd candlemas, or groundhog
day more or less associated with super
stition the United States over. The 12th
is an anniversary of the birth of Lin
coln, born 107 years ago. On the 14th
comes St. Valentine's day, when little
tokens of love and remembrance are
exchanged an ideal opportunity for
us to remind our absent relatives and
friends that they are still in our mem
ory. Sunday, the 20th is a more or
less widely known church day Septu
gesima meaning the third Sunday be
fore Lent. Washington's birthday
comes on the 22nd and is the 174th
anniversary of that event. On the 27th
is Sexagesima second Sunday before
Lent, and then the 29th Leap Year
Day, the extra one added to the month
one year in four which gives the year
the title of "Leap Year," during which
those girls of marriageable age who
think it is not embarrassing to "pro
pose" are offered an opportunity of
doing so themselves.
The word "February is from the
Latin "febru," meaning to purify.
