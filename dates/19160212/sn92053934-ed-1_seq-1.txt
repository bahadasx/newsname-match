Says Stores
Are Centers
for Slavers
Chicago, Feb. 12. Conditions of im
morality among clerks in State street
stores which rival those exposed by
the recent "Fox trot club" investiga
tion, were revealed today by an an
nouncement by Robert E. Hogan, an
assistant state's attorney in charge
of juvenile court work.
Many of the girl victims, said Mr.
Hogan, are not 16 years old.
"Through admissions made by two
men and a woman arrested in connec
tion with the case of a young girl a
month ago, I learned of the existence
of a white slave ring working in the
big stores," said Mr. Hogan. "Young
girls, shortly after obtaining employ
ment, are approached by another clerk
who invites her to dinner and intro
duces her to a man friend. This man
takes her to some hotel and forces
her into a life of shame.
"Last week my Investigators
brought five girls to my office and all
told the same story. Some said their
mothers had given them car fare
every day with which to go to work,
and that instead they have gone to
these hotels, receiving at the end of
every week $6 or $7 which they took
home as 'salary' to keep up the de
ception." Mr. Hogan said seven men and near
ly as many women have been named
in the confessions. Some of these per
sons already have been arrested.

ences which led Knox college authori

THINK AMERICAN
GOVERNMENT WILL
ISSUE A WARNING
Washington, Feb. 12. Diplo
matic representatives of the en
tente allies have made oral repre
sentations to Secretary Lansing
regarding the American memoran
dum to their governments suggest
ing the disarming of merchant
ships and suggesting that armed
merchantmen entering American
ports might be regarded as war
ships. Although the state department
declined to give the nature of the
representations, it Is said Secre
tary Lansing was Informed the en
tente powers were unwilling to
adopt the suggestion.
Berlin, (via London, Feb. 12, 9:30 a.
m.) Berlin newspapers publish dis
patches from the United States an
nouncing that it is expected the Wash
ington administration will soon issue a
warning to Americans not to travel on
mechantmen which are armed.
The newspapers say this announce
ment comes at a timely moment to con
firm the hopes entertained in Germany
that the new policy enunciated in the
German memorandum which declares .
that armed merchantmen will be treat
ed by Germany after Feb. 29 as war
ships, would be found to conform to
the revised ideas of the American state
department on the conduct of subma
rine warfare and hence tend to sim
plifying in the future the situation be
tween Germany and America on this
issue.
Official circles felt but little appre
hension regarding the reception of the
memorandum by the American govern
ment or the possibility that it would
complicate the settlement of the Lusi
tania issue. It is stated that a report
from Baron Zwiedinek von Sudenhorst,
the Austro-Hungarian charge d'af
faires at Washington, describing a
conversation with Secretary Lansing
regarding the disarmament proposals
has given the German and the Austrian
government a definite idea of the
American position. The main anxiety
felt by the German authorities has
been with regard to the reception
which would be accorded to the memo
randum by the press and public opin
ion of the United States.
The newspapers of Germany agree
in saying that it is scarcely correct to
refer to the policy announced in the
memorandum as new, since Germany
even before the war, officially had tak
en the position that ships armed In
accordance with Mr. Churchill's plan
lose their peaceful non-combatant prlv
ileges and that their crews should be
treated not even as belligerents, but as
pirates.

Crumpled Paper May
Solve Puzzle.
St. Louis, Feb. 12. Why Dr. Charles
Kennerly of San Antonio, Texas, and
Dr. A. F. Johnson of St. Louis, col
lege classmates, former business part
ners and lodge brothers, fought with
knives, revolvers and dental Instru
ments in the locked room of a leading
downtown hotel here last night, was
disclosed today by a crumpled piece of
paper found in Dr. Kennerly's pocket
The paper was an affidavit, copies of
'which had been sent to high Masonic
lodge officers here in which Dr. Ken
nerly accused his former associate of
failure to pay a $2,500 debt and of
withholding other funds which Dr.
Kennerly claimed were due him. The
affidavit asked that Dr. Johnson be
expelled from the Masonic order be
cause of the alleged wrongs to Dr.
Kennerly.
Johnson Horribly Slashed.
Dr. Johnson today is at the city
hospital hovering between life and
death, his face and body terribly
slashed, and a wound through both
hips and the groin made by a revolver
bullet. Dr. Kennerly, also cut about
the face and on both arms, is a
prisoner at the hospital, a police
chargo against him awaiting the out
come of Johnson's injuries.
Two other participants in the fight
also are prisoners. Walter A. Diffen
bach of Granite City, 111., is at a hos
pital with his throat cut almost from
ear to ear, and Charles Lody at police
headquarters.
Stories Conflicting.
Highly conflicting stories were told
by Kennerly, Lody and Diffenbach.
Kennerly said he "just happened to be
in Diffenbach's room" when Lody
and Dr. Johnson entered, the latter
with a pistol in one hand and a knife
in the other. Kennerly said he came
to St. Louis to collect the money he
claims from Johnson, but denied he'TOte for nati0nal convention delegates
used a revolver or that he fought ex
cept in self-defense.
Lody said that as an assistant to Dr.
Johnson, he accompanied the latter to
Diffenbach's room on a professional
call. Diffenbach, according to Lody,
had posed as "Mr. Arnold" and had re
quested Dr. Johnson to perform some
dental work on "Mrs. Arnold" in their
room at the hotel. As he and Dr.
Johnson stepped into the room, Lody
said, Diffenbach attacked Lody and !
Dr. Kennerly attacked Dr. Johnson. On
the bed two pillows and a sheet were
crudely molded into the form of the
"woman" Dr. Johnson was to treat.
Lody admitted cutting Dr. Kennerly
and Diffenbach but said he did it
only to save his own life and that of
his employer, Dr. Johnson.
Diffenbach admitted registering as
"Mr. and Mrs. D. E. Arnold of Mobile,
Ala." He said Dr. Kennerly had ar
ranged the dummy on the bed. Diffen
bach formerly lived in Granite
City, 111. Six months ago he was
married and moved to San Antonio.
Were In Business Together.
San Antonio, Texas, Feb. 12. Dr.
Charles W. Kennerly and Dr. A. F.
Johnson came to San Antonio about
six months ago and established a den
tal business as partners. When Dr.
Kennerly's health ailed several
months later he went away for a rest.
In his absence, according to Mrs. C.
H. Baker, Dr. Kennerly's sister, Dr.
Johnson sold out the business and
went to St. Louis.
Dr. Kennerly left San Antonio Mon
day for St Louis.

vice.
The Alaskan routes form a connect

routes the cost now is as high as $100,
