Where French Are Endeavoring ' to Recapture Posi
V tions Recently Lost to the Germans
BERLIN REPORTS REPULSE OF FOUR ATTACKS
The French Have Been Active With Their Artillery at Vari
, ous Points and Have Caused Considerable Damage
to German Positions Russians Have Repulsed Teu
r tonic Counter Attacks in Volhynia Petrograd Asserts
That the Muscovites Are Progressing in Their Campaign
Against the Turks.
Hard fighting Is still In progress
around Vlmy, where the French are
endeavoring to recapture positions
taken from them recently by the Ger
mane. Berlin reports that four French
attacks In this region have been put
down and also that a similar offensive
with- a like purpose south of the
Somme resulted in failure.
The French, however, have been ac
tive with their artillery at various
points and have caused considerable
damage to German positions.
In the Riga section of the Russian
front, artillery duels have been in
progress. In Volhynia, near Tchemer
Ine, the Russians have repulsed Teu
tonic counter-attacks, and northwest
of Tarnopol have held a strategic
height despite an attack by numerical
ly superior forces of Austro-Hnngari-ans,
according to Petrograd.
Except for the Artois region and the
Volhynia and East Galicia sections of
the Russian line, the virtual Inactivity
that has prevailed for several days
continues.
The Italians and Austrians are keep
ing up their artillery duels on the Aus-tro-Italian
front despite , the heavy
snows in the mountain regions and
here and there delivering Infantry at
tacks against each other, but without
appreciable result. In Albania the
Austro-iHungarians have occupied Tir
ana, a short distance northeast of the
port of Durazzo, and also dominating
heights in that region.
Petrograd says the Russians in their
operations against the Turks continue
to make progress and that all attempts
by the Ottomans to assume an offen
sive are being put down by the Russian
fire. Bombardments of Turkish posi
tions on the Black sea coast are being
kept up by Russian" ttorpedo craft. On
the other hand, Constantinople asserts
that in the fighting between the-TurkS
and the British In Mesopotamia the
British attempted an advance from the
right bank of the Tigris, but were
compelled to retreat to their old .posi
tions. -
AUSTRIANS INVESTIGATING
ATTACK ON PETROLITE
Befor Replying to Recent Notes of
the United States.
"Washington, Feb. ll.JInti(tnatrns
have reached the state department
that the Austrian government has de
cided to make a complete investi
gation of the facts connected with the
attack by an Austrian submarine up
on the American tank steamer Pe
trollte before replying to recent note3
of the United States asking an ex
planation of the incident. Conse
quently the reply will not appear for
some time, in the light of the exper
ience of the cas of the Ancona, be
cause of the difficulty In communi
cating with the commanders of the
submarines cruising in the Mediter
ranean. From the American point of view
admitting the right of the submarine
commander to halt the Petrolite, even
by force if she persisted in flight af
ter warning, there is absolutely no
warrant in international law for his
action in. "requisitioning" food or
other supplies from the ship. There
is strong objection also as to the as
sertion of the right by the Austrian
submarine commander to remove a
member of the crew of an American
ship as was done in the case of the
' Petrolite.
Although the seaman who was held
aboard the submarine as a hostage
while supplies were being transferred
from the Petrolite was an alien. In
the view of the state , department, he
was Just as much under the protec
tion of the American flag as any oth
er member of the crew.
NO ATTEMPT MADE TO
HUMILIATE GERMANY
By the United States During Lusitania
Controversy German News Bureau
So Declares.
Washington, Feb. 11. Secretary
Lansing in a statement secured here
today by the Wolff bureau, a semi
official German news agency, for publi
cation in Germany, declares that the
United States has asked nothing of
oermany cm ring the course of the
Lusitania negotiations which could not
without honor and dignity be complied
with. The statement was sought as a
reply to an interview with the German
imperial chancellor, widely published
In this country, in which it was con
tended that to meet the requirements
of the United States would impose an
"impossible humiliation'" on Germany.
Expressions similar to tha of Mr.
Lansing were obtained from Chairman
Stone of the senate committee on for
eign relatione, Chairman Flood of the
house committee on foreign affairs and
Vice President Marshall.
TO ALLOW APPAM TO V
STAY HERE IN DEFIN ITELY
Decision Reached Though Formal An
nouncement Will ba Made Later.
Washington, Feb. 11. Disposition
'of the British liner Appam, brought
Into Hamilton Roads by a German
prize crew, has been decided upon by
the United States and will be an
nounced later. While there is no offi
cial confirmation the indications are
liiat the Mliio will be permitted to re-
main in American wattrs as a prize
of the Germans indefinitely, under the
terms of the Prussian-American treaty.
DIPLOMATIC NEGOTIATIONS
"OF VARIED CHARACTER
Will Result from Teutonic Decision
About Armed Merchantmen.
Washington, Feb. 11. Diplomatic
negotiations of various characters
soon will confront the United States
as the result of the expressed inten
tion of the German and Austrian 'gov
ernments to treat armed merchant
ships of the entente allies as war ves
sels after 'Feb. 29.
Apparently It is certain, if the tem
per of the allied governments can be
Judged by the feelings of their diplo
matic representatives here, that any
attempt by the United States to
change the present rule permitting the
use of American porta by -merchant
ships armed for defensive purposes will
be met by a strong protest. Corre
spondence also is likely to follow if the
United States assumes a position
which coincides with that of Germany
and Austria regarding the right of
submarines to sink armed ships with
out warning.
On the other hand, het United States
itself may take the initiative should
the entente allies Impose a virtual
boycott on American ports in the event
of this government deciding that arm
ed merchant ships, entering American
waters are ships of war and therefore
subject to internment.
The definite attitude of the United
States toward the stated intention of
Germany and Austria will be deter
mined after the formal text of the
notes which have been handed to Am
bassador GerarA and Amfiassadee Pen
field are received from .Berlin and
Vienna.
MORE THAN 100 CONTRACTED
PTOMAINE POISONING
At Banquet Given in Honor of Arch
bishop Mundelein in Chicago. .
Chicago, Feb. 11. More han 100
persons who suffered ptomaine poison
ing from eating soup at a banquet
given last night at the University club
in honor of Archbishop George W.
Mundelein of the Roman Catholic
archdiocese of Chicago, had fully, re
covered today.
Nearly 300 guests were present, in
cluding many prelates from various
parts of the country. When the first
of the guests to be stricken fell or
rushed from the room there was gen
eral commotion.
Prompt first aid measures were ad
ministered by physicians present, and
most of those affected soon returned
to the banquet room.
Explaining the Incident, Dr. J. B.
Murphy said:
"An investigation discloses the pto
maine poisoning developed in the soup
served at the banquet. It was a biuollon
made from fresh chickens. The bouillon
was then permitted to cool and was
boiled again just before being served.
"Bouillon is the great culture medi
um In which germs grow. The germs
developed while the soup was cooling
ana after It cooled. When it was re
boiled the germs were killed, but the
poison thrown out by the germs was
left. That is the ptomaine poison."
REVOLT AMONG MEMBERS OF
STRIKING GARMENT WORKERS
Members of Dress and Waist Makers'
Union Demand Representation.
New York, Feb. 11. Union officials
in charge of the strike of 40,000 nee
dle workers for higher wages and
better working conditions were con
fronted today with the possibility of
a revolt by the members of the Dress
and Waist Makers Union. Several
hundred girls were exhorted by one
of their number at a meeting in a
downtown hotel to demand represen
tation in the strike management. Jen
nie Matyas, the insurrectionist, de
clared that 90 per cent, of those en
gaged in the dress and waist indus
try are girls, none of whom have any
real part in conducting the strike.
The girls are used merely as puppets,
she asserted. It was said after the
meeting that several prominent suf
fragists will support the feminine
workers in their demands for repre
sentation. ; President Samuel Gompers of the
American Federation of Labor, held
a conference here today with labor
leaders. He promised to do all in his
power to aid the striking members of
the International Ladies' Garment
Workers Union.
Seventeen strikers, six of them
women, were arrested today for dis
orderly conduct. They either were

TRIBUTES TO MEMORY
OF BOOKER T. WASHINGTON
Paid by Leaders of Negro Educational
Work at Memorial in Carnegie Hall.
'New York, Feb. 11. Tributes to the
memory and achievements of the late
Booker T. Washington were paid by
leaders in negro educational work at a
memorial meeting held tonight at Car
neige hall, under the auspices of Tus
kegee institute, which Dr. Washington
established; Hampton institute and the
National League on Urban Conditions
Among Negroes. Seth Low, former
mayor of New York, presided.
Major Robert R. Morton, command-,
ant of cadets at Hampton institute and
who has been elected to succeed Dr.
Washington as head of Tuskegee, eu
logized the late negro leader and de
scribed his labors for the uplift of his
race.
"Booker T. Washington's life and
work alone would have Justified Abra
ham Lincoln's idea and action regard
ing emancipation," he said. "Few men
in the world's history have been able
to accomplish In so short a period for
so large a mass' of people what Dr.
Washington was able to accomplish.
He organized and enheartened a race,
giving them a new idea of education
and of life, teaching the dignity, beau
ty and absolute necessity of industry
arid morality as fundamental in the
development of any people and lead
ing them to a belief in and a respect
for their own race.
"It was a difficult, embarrassing,
foreboding race problem which he
found. He left a clear, definite, hope
ful race programme, the letter and
spirit of which, if wisely and unselfish
ly followed, will without doubt bring in
the long run a happy, wholesome and
satisfactory solution and an adjust
ment mutually acceptable to all those
who are vitally interested."
REMARKABLE ANCIENT
FORTIFICATIONS IN PERU
Discovered by G. W. JVIonkill, Member
of Yale Expedition.
New York, Feb. 11. An ancient for-
tificaation declared to be more re
markable from a nengineering view
point than the pyramids of Egypt, has
been discovered in the Andes, accord
ing to G. W. Monkill, a member of the
Yale and Geographical society expedi
tions to Peru, who returned here today
on the United Fruit steamer Santa
Marta.
Mr. Monkill, who is a graduate of
McGlll university, Montreal, said the
Archaologists had discovered apparent
eyidences of a Pre-Azeto civilization
which flourished about the eighth cen.
titry. Excavaations made forty-five
miles from Cuzco, Peru, revealed the
fortification. It is an enormous edi
fic. Mr. Monkill said, composed of
stones weighing tltfrty and forty tons
which had been, transf erred from a
quarry across a river and t carried up
a steep mountain side.
Mr. Monkill said the only possible
theory as to the method used to con
vey the stones across the river was
that the natives dammed one half of
the . waterway, brought the stone to
the center, then built a second dam
across the remaining half and grad
ually destroyed the first dam.
EMBARGO MODIFIED BY '
NEW HAVEN ROAD.
Will Now Accept Freight Originating
West of the Hudson.
Boston, Feb.. 11. The New York,
New Haven and Hartford railroad and
the Central New England Railroad to
night announced that their recent em
bargo had been modified so that all
restrictions against freight originating
west of the Hudson river for stations
on those railroads had been removed,
except on shipments through Beacon,
N. Y, where continued -accumulation
of freight was reported. The em
bargo on shipments from the west to
points beyond the two roads. remain
in effect.
It is said there are still 50,000 cars
on the system, as has been the case
for more than two months, but that
reduction of the accumulation on corv
necting lines has made it possible to
modify the order. The possibility that
reinstatement of the embargo may be
necessary at a later date on account
of a rush of western shipments is men
tioned in the announcement.

Work at Religious Congress.
Panama, Feb. 11. A comprehensive
survey of all Latin-America for fu
ture occupation of missionary work
was today made in an address by
speakers from both Latin-America
and the United States at the second
day's session of the Congress on Re

America should be carefully surveyed

FEDERALIZATION OF NATIONAL GUARD
Housfl Bill Will Lay Its Stress Upon That Action
In National Defense Bill
NOTE OF HARMONY IN
House Military Committee Adopted a Resolution in Appreci
ation of the Confidence President Wilson Has Reposed in
It Final Draft is Being Made by Both House and Sen
ate Committees Both Branches Will Hold All Day Ses
sions Next Week to Hasten Action Provisions Will be
Made in the House Bill for the Quota of Troops to be
Furnished by Each State.
Washington, Feb. 11. A new note
of harmony and cooperation on na
tional defense problems was struck In
the house military committee today as
a direst result of the resignation of
Secretary Garrison of the war de
partment. It found expression in the
adoption of a resolution declaring the
committee's appreciation of the con
fidence of President Wilson reposed
in It and in the sacrifice, as disclosed
in his correspondence with Mr. Gar
rison. Non-Partisan Feeling.
The non-partisan character of the
feeling was emphasized by the fart
that the resolution was offered by Rep
sentative Kahn, of California, ranking
republican member of the committee.
Members of both the congressional
committees declared that the war sec
retary's withdrawal had brought out
sharply the president's desire that con
gress should work out it3 army prob
lems in the light of its own best judg
ment, despite his personal preference
for the continental army advocated by
Mr. Garrison and the army war col
lege. The net sult, they agreed, was
a clarification of the congressional, at
mosphere and the assurance of sup
port for the bills that will be drafted
from elements pf both the democratic
and republican 'sides that had hereto
fore been counted againat the meas
ures, i
In substance, it is believed, th bills
will represent an effort to make. ef
fective virtually all of the plan 4 of the
war department with the exception
that federalization of the. national
guard will be sought as a' substitute
for the continental army plan.'.
Final Steps in Committees.,
Final steps toward beginning the
drafting of the measures wore taken
today by both bouse and senatw com
mittees. Both will take up the work
Monday and H is planned to hold all

public Jiearings or. TSijT'-i'-ians anu
ordered m wfeiabthtrie' . iedx,r of- . the
voluminous testimney prepared, so
there would be as little delay as pos
sible either in committee consider
ation or the coming struggle on the
floor. Similar steps were taken by
the senate committee.
Federalization of National Guard.
Present indications are that the
house bill will lay its stress upon pro
visions designed to federalize the na
tional guard, while the senate commit
tee's main effort will go into the "reg
ular army angles of preparedness
plans. The final measures sent to the
president for his signature will be, a
compromise, it is thought, each house
bilng willing to accept the Judgment
of the other to a large extent in its
own particular field.
Payment of Guardsmen.
The house bill, it is expected, will
provide for payment of national
guardsmen who comply with all regu
lations laid down by congress on a
basis sufficiently liberal to insure the
recruiting of approximately . 400,000
men,, the ultimate size of the proposed
continental army. To make certain
the availability for federal use in time
of war or great emergency of all men
who participate in this payment, the
plan contemplates authorizing the
president to draft into a volunteer
army.
Members of the committee are vir
tually unanimous in the opinion that
congress has full constitutional au
thority to enact such a measure and
that it can be so formulated as to
withstand any attack through the
courts.
Training and Discipline.
The system contemplated is of a
broad character, designed to provide
for the training, the discipline cf the
guardsmen in peace times in a way
that will insure efficient organizations
for volunteer war service. Only the
administration of the law would be
left with the war department.- It is
proposed also to provide under these
regulations for the coordination of en
listment periods, physical standards
and the examinations which officers
appointed by state authorities must
pass for an adequate reserve system
for the guard and for a standardized
metrod of recruiting to fill up the
wastage of regiments sent to the front.
Quota of Troops to Each Stat.
Provision also will be made under
which the quoto of troops to be fur
nished by each state and the propor
tions of artillery, calvary, engineers.
signal corps and other special service
troops would be determined by the war
department. Special federal apororia-
tions will be proposed for the Main
tenance of these more costly special
arm troops by the states.
Situation In Senate.
The situation in the senate commit
tee is not so well crystallized. It is
indicated, however, that its legislation
for the regular army will include sub
stantially all of the plans of the war
college as to organization and that
it will be accompanied by a volunteer
army reserve act designed to btrtld up
and maintain a force more than eqal
in numbers to the force with t the
colors.
Short enlistments with the colors
and the discharge into the reserve of
any man found efficient by his officers
at the end of a year's training un
doubtedly wil be among the plans pro
posed to accomplish this end.
Increase of 40,000 Men,
As to the size of the standing army
the men with the colors it is indi
cated that the senate bill will exceed
the increase of 44.000 men" asked by
MILITARY COMMITTEE
Secretary Garrison and many senators
will urge the full 250,000 total strength
sought by the war college. Chairman
Chamberlain has prepared a bill carry
ing out the plan of 1912 devised by
the war college and which would pro- .
vide a force with the colors of ap
proximately 200,000 men.
It was over this plan that Secre
tary Garrison and Senator Chamber
lain came into sharp disagreement last
year. The chairman urged a com
plete reorganization of the army as
suggested by the plan of 1912. Secre
tary Garrison, however, presented a
series of bills resigned to strengthen
what he conceived to be the weakest
spots in the army and held that these
should be enacted to be followed by
other bills to carry out the full plan.
Regular Army of 2C0,0C0 Men.
It was reported tonight that the
house Will be willing to accept the sen
ate's regular army plans even on a
basis of 200,000 men with the colors,
providing the national guard feder
alization plans went through.
In addition to plans already outlin
ed, it is now thought there wiU be
provided in the bills proposed, or In
companion measures, a definite - plan
for indiistriil mobilization In time ot
war behind the fighting . lines. Re
serves of civilian aides to mtliiary op
erations such as railroad men, auto
mobile drivers and mechanics,
telegraphers, telephone engineers and
operators and the thousand, and one
men of .c.lier civil occupation neces
sary to ah army probably will be
formed, the task beingaade. n meas
ure by the fact that enrollment wilt
be all thiat Is necessary, the men be
ing in constant training in peace, times
in the very duties they would ie called
upon to perform in war.
