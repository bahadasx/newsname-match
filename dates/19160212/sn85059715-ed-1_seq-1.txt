PITTSBURG. Feb. 12.?The Glassworker
comments as follows on the
window glass situation:
The growing feeling among window
glass workers that they should be
given an advance in wages seetns to
have failed utterly in striking a responsive
chord In the minds of hand
plant manufacturers, and the wlslicdfor
rai3e will not materialize, for the
present at least.
Following a very thorough discussion
of trade and factory conditions
at the meeting of the National Association
of Window Glass Manufacturers
held In Indianapolis Wednesday
of this week, the matter of the workers'
demands was referred to the wage
conim'lttee. It Is not likely that the
committee wilt report on the question
until considerable later.
The Indianapolis meeting was well
attended, particularly by western
manufacturers. Twenty-five members
of the association were present, representing
1,500 pots.

While the association never attempts
to fix prices, the market was
thoroughly discussed, and the concensus
of opinion was strongly against
any further advance in window glass
prices at this time.
i Reports presented showed that the
i production now amounts to 1,000,000
1 boxes n month.
Factory conditions and wages came
in for much discussion, nearly every
' manufacturer attending having something
to say during the open debate,
i The opinion was generally voiced that
the claims of the glassworkers for
morlS pay at this time aro not defendahle
and that existing conditions do
not justify manufacturers in advancing
wages. It was pointed out that
i the workers are receiving more wages

Great political battles were fougnt |
ind won (luring the construction of1
lie municipality of Broad Oaks but j
lever in Ihe history of the small
municipality has there been such
titter strife among tho residents of
hat suburb as at the present time.
The trouble all started at a meetng
of the ctlincll held last Monday
light in the town hall when C. M. [
Jotfman who was elected a councilman
at the January election was not
iliowed to qualify as a councilman :
because ho did not own $100 worth 1
bf porsonal property or at least he
a-as not taxed for $100 worth of personal
property. One of the election :
laws of the municipality rcqulro a
man to be taxed for at least $100
ivorth of property before ho is cllg-1
ble to hold office.
After throwing Coffmnn out of his
bfllcc Monday night, the newly elect- j
i-d officers qualified and started to;
transact business. The first business j
before the body was to fill the va- J
cancy nuido by removing Mr. coll- j
man.
The council elected T. J. Holt to
fill the vacancy. The next business
before the council wag to net upon
the resignation of Charles Mc.Munn
who wag elected mayor at the .lunu- i
ary election hut who for business:
reasons could not serve. The council
accepted Ids resignation and electJoseph
I?: Craddock mayor. The
newly elected mayor then qualified
and took charge of the meeting, ft
was at this point that the trouble
started. When the council took up
the olectlon of sergeant for the city.
It was learned that the council was
divided ss to which of the two applicants
for the position Bhould be
elected. Charles N. Pcarroll, the
present holder of the position, and
Joseph Lynch were the two applicants.
After, much argumont the
election of the sergeant was carried
over to the Friday night meeting
of the council.
All day Friday It was whispered !
around that there wero going to be |
big doings Friday night, so the coun-;
sll chamber was filled to tho doors
when Mayor Craddock called that:
body to order.
During the week friends of Mr.
CofTman, who was disqualified to
bold the position of councilman to
which he was elected, had been busy
and just as soon as the council was
called to order, they gained the floor
and contested the right .of C. J. Cottrill,
recorder, and Nat Vance, councilman
.elected at the January elec-.
lion, to hQld ofUce. They stated that

This made the situation more 1
complicated, because If Cottrlll and'^

all the work of the council at
Its Monday night inoetlng was not

legal council men prosenl. They con- <
tended, therefore, that (lie election i
of Joseph N. Craddock and T. J.

could not act last night,
With this mixed up affair facing
them, many speeches were made by
both slilos and hot remarks were
mnde by members of both sides.
After arguing the ciucstlon pro and
con for more than an hour, the council
adjourned until 7:30 o'clock Saturday
night when tho fight will again

It wns learned Saturday that
when tho meeting starts tonight that

If the other contested points can
