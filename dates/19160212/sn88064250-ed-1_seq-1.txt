ANDRUS RALLY TO
BE HELD HERE SUNDAY
Popular Young Candidate for As
sessor Will Speak at Courthouse.
SUPPORTERS FROM .OVER
PARISH WILL BE HERE
Meeting Will Be One of the Largest
Ever Held in Opelousas by Can
didate for Minor Office
Posters are out announcing the
big A. L. Andrus political rally,
which will take place at the parish
courthouse on Sunday (to-morrow)
afternoon at 4 o'clock. Supporters
of Mr. Andrus, who led in the three
cornored race for assessor by a
handsome plurality, will be headed
towards this city on Sunday even
ing.
While some who are opposed to
Mr. Andrus have attempted to proev
that he has made combinations
Swith candidates for other offices,
that he has attempted to "ride'two
horses," the many supporters of
the popular young native of Girand
Coteau, know that he has been
making a clean, open and above
board fight during the entire cam
paign.
That the majority of the people
;of St. Landry believe Mr. Andrus
should be the parish assessor can
Ã½" be deduced from the returns of the
first Democratic primary 'held on
the- 25th of last month, when he
led in a hot fought three-cornored
:tace by a safe plurality.
On Sunday afternoon the voters"
q Of Opelousas will be given their
First opportunity to hear Mr. An
Sdrus speak in his behalf, as candi
dilate for assessor. That he will be
given a hearty reception is a fore
3gone conclusion. It is predicted
'that the Sunday meetng will be the
largest ever held by any candidate
,:for minor office in this parish.
Mr. Andrus is a forceful oraLor,
w: iwho makes a splendid talk, appeal
'i~bg to the voters of St. Landry for
=iblir suffrage on the ground of
eod.petency. He will be at his best
on Sunday evening and friend and
foe are all invited to attend to hear
,a splendid address from the next
:ssessor of old St. Landry.
"<< During the past week Mr. Andrus
bas conducted a series of meetings
Sthiroughout the parishy, meeting
iwith success all along the road.
His frienids are freely predicting
rhis election will be by a very safe
imajority and. that he will come to
Opelousas from the country with
.:a lead of several hundred votes.
-.ndications point to an Andrus vie
tn. in at least four of the six
'wards in this parish on Tuesday,
; February 29th.

PARISH TO HAVE FARM
DEMONSTRATOR THIS YEAR
Police Jury Finally Agrees to Hire
Competent Man to Show Farm
ers A Few Things
yII`'The police jury, on Monday
oirning, adopted a resolution au
torizing the United States Agri
I-ltural Department to engage the
iervioes of a competent graduate
f an agricultural college as farm
- :enonstrator for St. Landry. This
:iarish will pay $600 per year to the
-demonstrator, while Uncle Sam
C'will donate the remaining $600 of
the agriculturist's salary.
i: Two or three times during the
p:iast couple of years a resolution
- -was offered for the purpose of se
Luring a farm demonstrator for
Sthis parish, but every time it was
ibirought up it was ingloriously de
;.feated on the grounds that St. Lan
i dry did not have sufflicient funds
0to justify the expenditure of $600
'per annum. On last Monday, how
: ever, the resolution was passed by
*is practically unanimous yote.
If a competent man is secured;
many argue, St. Landry will de
rive much good out of the services
-of the farm demonstrator. Others
fear, however, that if an incompe
tent man is engaged, St. Landry
will spend $600 per year for futile
efforts to assist the formers in
learning scientific farming. The
Sjurors, however, rest their hope
:with the United States Department
of Agriculture, as it is expected
:that a' competent agriculturist, a
graduate of some reliable agricul
. tural college, will be appointed, in
which event it is thought that the
farm demonstrator will make the
farrmers "stand up and take note."
, Abraham Boudreau, a prosper
Sous and ppogressie young merchant

. Wednesday evening to attend the
S.Collins meeting. He incidentally
Spaid the Clarion a pleasant call.
PRESCOTT ELECTED
PUBLIC SCHOOL HEAD
PRINCIPAL OF OPELOUSAS HIGH SCHOOL IS CHOSEN ON FIRST
BALLOT TO It EPLACE C. J.
THOM PSON
W. B. Prescott, principal of the
Opelousas High School, friend and
adviser of C. J. Thompson for a
number, of years, has been chbsen
to fill the unexpired term of par
ish school superintendent, the va
cancy being caused by the death
of C. J. Thompson, which occurred
at Beaumont, Texas, last ,week.
Mr. Prescott was elected on'the
first ballot, securing 8 out of 15
votes, Professor Griffith of Eunice,
receiving 5, and Professor Bittle of
Washington, receiving 2.
As expected, the meeting of the
school board was a stormy one,
members orating at various times
in favor of their choice for head of
the schools of St. Landry and it
was only when the final vote was
cast when the result was known.
All three applicants represented
their claim, each settling forth his
plan of conducting the affairs of
the public schools of this parish.
They were all on equal footing, be
ing competent, efficient, industri
ous and well liked, but Mr. Pres
cott was regarded as being in line
for the promotion, having for many
years been in close touch with the
doings of the board and on various
occasions acted as superintendent
pro tempore.
Mr. Prescott is comparatively a
young man, having been born on
the 23rd of November, 1874. He
MILLS AND HEBERT ARE
STILL TIED FOR JUROR
Court Decides in Favor.of Bellevue
Candidate and Ballot is Counted
for Both Candidates
The appeal of R. Lee Mills to tahe
court to have the executive com
mittee re-opeh the Bellevue .bal
lot box and count a ballot, which
was thrown out as spoiled, was
granted by Judge B. H. Pavy, on
Saturday. To the surprise of many
the ballot in question was discov
ered to have the names of both
candidates on it, hence making the
result remain a tie.
A second primary is now inev
itable between the two contenders
for the fourth member of the po
lice jury from the first ward. Mr.
Mills hails from the Bellevue sec
tion, while Mr. Hebert comes from
that section of the ward east of
Opelousas. Bellevue is now the
only portion of the ward without
representatiogi
The two contenders for the office
of police jury are well known and
both are popular, both are farmers
who have made a, success of their
business and it is predicted that
the race will be excitingly in
teresting,
The friends of Mr. Mills predict
that he will come out victorious, as
his candidacy is being urged on
the plea that Bellevue should be
given one member of the police
jury. There is nothing, however,
to say to the detriment of Mr. He
bert's candidacy, outside of the
fact that one member, Mr. J. T. St.
Cyr, who is a neighbor of Mr. He
bert has already been elected. Mr.
Hebert is a gentleman of quality
,nd enjoys a large hiumber of per
sorlal friends.

MISSES SANDOZ ENTERTAIN
Just as the golden rays of the
winter sun closed the afternoon on
Saturday a coterie of charming
young ladiesl and matrons took
leave reluctantly from the lovely
home of Mr. and Mrs. P. A. Sandoz
where they had been sumptuously
entertained by the Misses Sandoz
at 500 and lovely buffet luncheon.
Those enjoying the hospitality of
the gracious young hostesses,
Misses Lurie and Gladys Sandoz,
were, Mrs. John Prescott of Wash

home in Washington and subse
quently went to the Louisiana State
University, Baton Rouge, where he r
was graduated in 1895. Coming
back to his native parish he was t
appointed as teacher in the Wash
ington High School in 1897; he re,
remained in Washington until 1901,
when he was promoted to princi
pal of the Opelousas High School
which position he has held with
honor to hjmself and credit tot the
citizens of this city, ever since.
A few years' back Mr. Prescott
married Miss Lucille Anderson,
daughter of Mrs. C. M. Thompson,
a member of one of St. Landry'si
prominent and influential families.
Mr. Prescott himself is a descend- i
ant of one of the gallant pioneer
families of St. Landry, many of his
ancestors having served in public
capacities with honor.
The appointment of Mr. Prescott
to the superintendency of the pub
lic schools of this parish comes as
a tribute to service well and faith
fully performed; he is universally
popular with the people of this
city, who have come to regard Mr.
Prescott as a "home product:'
The Clarion joins Mr. Prescott's
many friends in extending to him
hearty congratulations, at the
same time wishing him success in
his new undertakings.

DEJEAN WANTS SIXTH
WARD DEBTS WIPED OUT
Progressive Plaquemine Point
Farmer Anxious to Start as
Police Juror Unbridled
W. C. Dejean, a political leader
of the big sixth ward, who was
elected a member of the police jury
at the recent primary, was in Ope
lousas on Monday evening to ap
pear before the police jury.. Mr.
Dejean is anxious that no bridle be
put on him, when he begins to
serve his four year term as police
juror, and consequently appealed
to the police jury to wipe some of
the debts owed by the present po
lice jurors of the sixth ward.
SMr. Dejean is looked frward to
as one who will do much towards:
improving the condition of affairs in
this parish. He is one of the most
progressive farmers of St. Landry,
and by dint of hard labor has ac

NEGRO IS KILLED IN
'THE PARISH PRISON
Robert Willianms, Strange Black,
Stabs Andrew Glynn to Death
OCCURED IN PARISH JAIL
ON FRIDAY MORNING
The Two Negroes Scuffled Only A
Short While When One Fell
Mortally Wounded
A killing occurred on Friday T
morning at about 8:30 right in the T
parish jail, while the jailer, was on
the outside, not suspecting that any
such tragedy would happen.
Andrew Glynn, a negro put in1
jail a short while ago, on charges
preferred by Washington people,
was stabbed to death by Robert '
Williams, a black desperado, who
was jailed in September by Officer
Plais Horn, for stealing 'chickens I
from the Andrepont farm, and for
shooting with intent to kill one
John, alias Cyrus Felise. Williams E
is a strange negro, no one being
able to ascertain from whence he
blew into Opelousas. It was known
however, that he was a bad negro,
as he had taken a shot at another t
negro on the Washington road, one
night, without any provocation;
whatever.
The two blacks quarreled and t
then began to scuffle, a short while
after which Willianms stuck the
blade of his knife in the neck of
the other black; GlynA bled to
death before medical aid could be
rendered.
A large crowd congregated around
the jail soon after the tragedy in
an endeavor to find out particu
lars of the incident, but the offi
cers themselves seemed 'to be ig
norant of the full particulars.
Williams was put in the "Bull,
Pen" and will no doubt be charged
with the murder at the coming
meeting of the grand jury.

Bureau of the Census Department
of Commerce, announced the pre
liminary report of cotton ginned
prior to January 16 by parishes in
Louisiana for the crops of 1915 and
1914.
There is not a single parish that
can show an increase of cotton over
the year 1914, every one without
exception showing a big increase.
St. Landry fell short of nearly
nine thousand bales in 1915, pro
ducing only 13,430 bales in 1915 as
against 22,190 in 1914. Evangeline

TO DISCUSS PROPOSED
CHANGE IN CHARTER
MAYOR WILL CALL MIASS MEETING NEXT MONTH TO TALK OVER
LONGER TERM FOR OFFICIALS AND THE
ADJUSTMENT OF TAXES
A mass meeting will be called by tl
Mayor Edward L. Loeb during the
next month for the purpose of sub- it
mitting a proposed amendment to y
the Opelousas charter. h
Many complaints have been reg- ti
istered at various times on account w
of the several deficiencies in the so
local charter and it appears to be
the desire of the majority of the a
voters here to amend the charter. a
It is urged that the municipal p
election should not occur on the ci
same date as the parochial and state y
elections; it is also claimed that ci
the municipal officers should be fi
elected for a term of -four years, v
instead of two. This is an admir- ci
able move, according to expres
sions heard on the subject. o0
Mayor Loeb is of the opinion that to
the matter of adjusting ti:e' taxes p
should be attended to; he asserts c:
that Opelousas residents should not h
be forced to pay the ten mill parish o:
tax, which under the present law h
ANNUAL FAIR DATE
FIXED BY DIRECTORS ,
Meeting Is Held and Enthusiasm 11
Prevails Among the Directors
FAIR TO BE GREATEST IN c
THE ENTIRE STATE
Plans Will Soon Be Perfected for C
the Next Annual Parish Fair t
to Take Place on Oct. 6, 7 and 8..
At a call meeting of the directors b
of the St. Landry Farmers Fair As- o
sociation it was decided that the 0
next annual fair to be held on Oct. tl
6, 7, and 8, Friday, Saturday and F
Sunday
The meeting which was held in the A
police jury room on Wednesday
morning served to put new vigor t
in the members of theboard of dir
ectors who werepresent and they
all determined to make the next a
fair to be held under the auspices a
of the St. Landry Farmers Fair As
sociation the best and finest agricul
tural show ever staged in any one
parish in Louisiana. aF
Dr. R. M. Littell; who so ably s
guided the affairs of the asso
ciation through one successful year
as its president, called the meeting
to order and read a lenghty and
comprehensive report of his stewar- r
ship, which was accepted and ap
proved as read.
On motion of R. Lee Mills the
president was apthorized to appoint t
a new executive committee. This i
committee will be instructed that
in the future all concessions will be
chat'ged for.
The folloiwng resolution offered i
by Dr. J. A. Haas was unanimously
adopted:
Whereas;- The St. Landry Clarion t
generously published all the pro
ceedings of the fair and in its
weekly issues boosted its objects t
and purposes without any compen
sation whatever;
E Resolved that a vote of thanks
by this directorate be extended to
the said St. Landry Clarion.
On motion of Dr. Gardiner the
executive committee was instructed
to appoint a sub-committee on races
to be confined to home stock, driven
by local people. The object of this
resolution being to develop t'he
stock industry of this parish and
to illimanate the disreputible
jockey features that characterize
Sso many races of the past, the reso
lution was uninmously adopted.
The members of the board of dir
ectors and the executive committee,
as well as all those who are inter
I ested in' the ultimate success of
the fair was urged and appointed
as a committee of one to dispose
of the unsold portion of the capital
stqck of the St. Landry Farmers
.Fair Association so as to effect a
permanent organization under the
Slaws of the State Fair Associatioon.
- A resolution was offered by Dr.
Gardiner that a vote of thanks be

r Littell, to Mr. Perrin, national dem
gonstration agent, Mr Felix Dezauche

-.resolution was unanimously carried.
The meeting adjourned sine die.
they are compelled to "fork up." ,
Several moves have been made
in that direction, during as many
years, without avail, but it is the
hope of the Opelousas chief execu
tive that the citizens themselves it
will take up the matter to a final B
settlement.
There is no denying the fact that b
a change in the charter would be
welcomed by the majority of the
people of this city; with the muni- d
cipal elections occurrring every two p
years, the voters of Opelousas 'are it
constantly kept busy by pleadings b
from politicians; every move is a
veritable political stunt and a
change would be wma:^,;ne.
The mayor and other municipal B
officers should he elected for a
term of at least four years; under o0
present conditions municipal oif- ti
cials are kept in constant fear - of
harming themselves politically and U
often times some good move is de- d
layed. C

cally.
Mr. Collins was sent out by the f
Supreme Council of the 1Knighs of a
Columbus to lecture thr..ug:hout e
the United States upon the evils
which corrupt society today. He ti
related to his listeners the lack rf a
harmony existing throu;g'iout mnst n
of the United States between Cfah- s
olic and Protestant, Jew and pen
tile, but laid stress on the fact that
people were becoming m ire and b
more appreciative or the spirit of p
America and disregarding that n
prejudice of creed an I therefor:~d
tending more and more towar ds
harmony. He said ttalt condition
is shown in one instance by the t
appointment of Chief Justice t hite,
a Catholic, to the Supreme Court t,
Bench of the United States, by a
Protestant president. In another f
instance the recent appoiitr.ient by o
President Wilson of Mr. Brandeis

said he was glad t see ,he bar- I
mony which exist? in Louisiana
and .in this comamnmt,; htwe~on fl

His discussion was well
received as shown by the arn:ount
of applause -which was manifetedi.
Grand Knight Frank Dietlein t
acted as chairman, wh. first in- a
tsoduced Mrs Percy Wa;ker, whd0
in turn introduced lMr. ColliLs,. e,
plaining to the audience the spirit
which ,prompted tFe ' Suprene
Council of the Knights of Columbus t
in sending out Mr. Collins. Be 1
told the audience that the Knightbl t
of Columbus sent Mr. Collins upon e
this journey, not to explain the i
principles or further the cause of f
the Order but to better the condi- i
tion of humanity and to try to cor- I
rect the evils of society.
After Mr. Collins iad finished
speaking, Mr. W; J. Sandoz arose
and moved that a vote of thanks be i
extended to him, subsequent to l
which the meeting closed.
