NOSE HOLDING FEAT
Opposition to Harrison Is Making
the Most 6f It in the Present
Battle.
Is It good politics to declare that
you had to hold your nose while vot
ing a Democratic ticket?
It is one of the Issues In the Dem
ocratic National delegate fight
Former Mayor Harrison's nose Is in
the thick of the battle, In this connec
tion. I
When the Ave times Mayor declared
last spring that he would have to,
hold his nose whlje he was voting the
Democratic mayoralty ticket he made
history evidently.
It Is the sort of history that Is be
ing repeated over and over again for
the benefit of beginners In politics.
The Sullivan men are using It In
this campaign for all It Is worth.
They are also alleging that while
Mayor Harrison held his nose and
voted for Sweltzer
Hla followers are said to have for
gotten about their noses and voted
for Thompson by the thousands.
Result,
Sunday closing,
Republican victory,
Democrats out of Jobs,
Loss of Democratic control of the
City Government.
