"THE SERPENT"
Again

Role.
Vampire
Play De ate With Russian
Serf's Beautiful Daughter,
Who, Trod Beneath Heel
of a Duke, Bares
Fangs at Mankind.
Her
VANIA LAZAR (Theda Bara)
is the beautiful daughter of a
Russian serf. She lives with lier
parente in a email cottage close
to the vast estates of the Grand
Duke Valonoff. ValonofT, despite
his title, is nothing more than a
wealthy libertine His one re
deeming quality is the love he
f' els for his sou, Prince ValonofT
The Grand Duke has practically
forgotten the existence of Ivan
\j4 tzar, until one day when he
blunders on the Lazar cottage
aftei lie and his followers have
lost their way during a wild boar
bunt.
The Grand Duke sees for the
first time Vania, who is in love
with Audrey Sobl, a young pea
sant. Valonoff is enraptured
with her charms and decides that
he will see her again. To fur
ther his .purpose he leaves his
gold cigarette case in the serf's
cottage when taking his depar
ture The ease Is found by Ivan,
who, fearing that he will be ac
cased of theft, sends Vania to re
turn It to its owner.
The Grand Duke's plans have
worked as he expected, lie
greets Vania joyously and makes
ardent love to her. Following
her seduction, he maintains lier
in style and lavishes upon her
every gewgaw that her heart de
sires. The sudden change in sta
tlon is almost beyond the compre
hension of the daughter of the
poverty stricken serf. And yet
she likes her new life. It is so
different from anything she has
known
Valonoff, ultimately tiriDg of
Vania, makes no effort to conceal
the fact that bis infatuation has
waned. Despite her pleadings,
he casts Vania off, and devotes
his attention to some new
charmer. It is the turning point
iu Vania's life. That she ever
would be separated from the
Grand Duke has never been con
ceivable to her. She analyzes
the cause of her plight, and she
resolves the cause into one word
—Man!
Varna argues to herself that
the most poisonous serpent iB
comparatively harmless unless
molested; trod on, it strikes
She reasons that she has been
trod on, ground beneath the
heel of Man, and she, too, deter
mines to bare her fangs. Her
prey is to be all men, not one
Her beanty enables her to come
within easy striking distance of
her victims. And her venom is
potent.
Vania arrives in Paris The
war is in progress As she watches
one of the long lines of wonnded
soldiers pass by she notices a face
which awakens memories. She
makes inquiry and discovers that
ihe wounded officer is Prince Va
lonoff, son of the Grand Duke.
She helps nurse him back to
health, and ho, too, falls victim
to her charms.
Shortly after their marriage
the Grand Duke, who is ignorant
that the Priuce is wed, sends
word that he Is coming to visit
his -beloved and only son. The
Prince is called away before his
father's arrival." Vania greets
the Grand DukF, who does not
recognize her. He makes love to
her after she has lured him on
The Prince returns at the ap
pointed hour, known to Vania,
and, finding bis wife clasped in
the arms of bis own father, com*
tnits suicide. The last drop of
venom from "The Serpent's"
fangs has found its mark.

APPEAL
To those of our citizens, who
think ihe cause worthy of consid
eration, t in's is address*d:
Permission has been granted
me to use the City j til building
as a Charity Hospital, provided
its repair, equipment and main
ta'nence can be assured with no
expeuse to the City treasury.
The necessity of some place to
care for unfortunates, who at
times, call on the City for aid has
been forcibly demonstrated on
many occasions in t he past. The
future, no doubt, will present the
same problems. It is possible to
couvert this building into an iu
stitiition which will meet the re
quirements, but to do so will ne
cessitate the expenditure of a
sum which will have tobe provid
ed by a source other than the one
stated The amount needed will
not be excessive, and ils conserv
stive management will enable
the materialization of plans which
win »afford the relief sought.
None areso poor as the friendless
and destitute; the stranger in a
strange [»lace, without funds to
enable him to provide the neues
slties when ill, presents a sad sit
nation—one not easily for got try.
it is in behalf of these, and those
of onr own cily, who need our
aid, that I ask contributions No
amount is too small, and will be
gladly received,

"A BUTTERFLY ON
THE WHEEL."
Holbrook Blinn & Vivian
Martin Two Enormously
Popular Stars in a
World Film Ftatura
Holbrook Blinn (the most virile
aud decisive actor in motion pic
tures) and Vivian Martin (the
daintiest star iu filtudom) play
opposite each other in World
Film Corporation's presentation
of "A Butterfly on the Wheel"
based upon the stage play of the
same name which was offered to
the public » few years ago.
The story is that of a enccess
fal man of business who neglects
his youDg wife. She in her turn
listens to the pleadings of an at
dent admirer, but nevertheless
remains true to her husband.
The latter however, catching the
couple in suspicious circum
stances over which neither have
control, seizes the opportunity of
divorcing bis wife. But after
much unhappiness the couple is
reunited.
I his powerful story, which is
here only faintly outlined, af
fords M. Tourneur the opportun!,
ty of introducing some startling
and realistic effects, notably one
illustrating the burning of a the
atre, the people in the doomed
house barely escaping with their
lives.
"A Butterfly on the Wheel
will be presented at the Elks' the
atre on February 18th.
A MAN AND A JOB«
Mr. Editor: With your permis
sion I would like to call to the at.
tention of your readers a few
brief statements about the mau
nerio which Mr. John Angers,
the former Chief Engineer of the
Electric Light Plant & Water
works, came to be succeeded by
another.
Mr. Angers made a demand
upon me that I "either discharge
Mr Eugene.Lopez, or accept bis
(Mr, ADger's) resignation." Not
being accustomed to allow au em
ployee to dictate my course to
wards another employee, I ac
cepted Mr. Auger's alterpative
proposition.
If the discharge of Mr. Lopez
had been a request, based upon
provable charges, I might have
acted with more consideration.
But the usurpation of my prero
gative left me but one self-re
specting coarse.
Id regard to the effort to make
political capital ont of any re
mark charged to me of a day fol
lowing the first phases of this in
cident, 1 will add that my coarse
was dictated by common sense
and self-respect. Nothing more.

BROUSSARD IS
OPPOSED TO
SOGAR TRUST'S
"DRAWBACKS."
Senator Declares Corporation
Has Used Refunds to l>t
triment of Sugar Planters
in Peace Times, But Aside
From This in Present Situ
ations When Taxes Are
Increased Generally, Mo
nopoly Should Bear Share
of Burden hy Foregoing
Bounty.
Senator R F. Broussard be
lieves t he Sugar Trust should net
I he permitted to continue to take
I ' drawbacks" from the federbl
! treasury during a time when it is
! enjoying unusual profits on for -
j eign shipments aid ihe country
at large is struggling under ab
normally heavy taxation to make
up dr licit« due to the war,
Senator Broussard remarks
that while the question of whether
it is proper to make these allow
auce's in time of peace is not in
volved at preseut, that he be
lieves the American Sugar Refin
ing company iu the past has used
tire "draw backs" to the detri
meut of Louisiana [Banters.
A "drawback" is a refund [»aid
by the government to sugar refio
ers on customs duties previously
paid by the refiners for the ad
mission of sugar to this country—
the refund being made wbén the
refined product from this sugar is
shipped out of the country again
for foreign consumption. Mr.
Broussard estimates the present
"drawback" refund above five
millions of dollats a year. He
has demanded information from
the treasury department to show
exaotly what it is. Whatever it
is, he says, it is pu re bounty; and
this Is no time for the govern
inert to confer bounty on anybody
while everybody is sweating un
der unusual taxes.
EXPLAINS RESOLUTION.
1 he correspondent of a New
Orleans tuorniiig newspaper re
cently commented on the Brous
sard resolution. That comment,
says the senator, misses the point
he had iu mind. He has address
ed the following explanation of
this to Secretary Giraffe, of the)
Louisiana Gane Growers' associa
tion:
''My point of view is, that those
who are benefited out of the
treasury from a motive of pure
bounty on the part of oar govern
ment, should be required to fore
go such advantages at least dut
ing the period of tIrene extraordi
uary taxes. Many senators who
have spoken to me on the subject
are also of the opinion that this
should be done.
"The reason that so much sn
gar is being exported upon which
a drawback in [raid out of the
treasury is the high price pre
vailing in Europe due to the war
Ample profit is being made out of
these sales during these extraor
diuary times, to yield a handsome
profit with the drawback elimi
nated. Therefore, should not the
government before imposing ad
ditional and extraordinary taxeB
upon the people withhold for the
time being at least these bounties
that are making, such heavy in
roads into the public funds! Why
not these manufacturers be made
to contribute their just share ot
these taxe» by foregoing kind
nesses which the government has
shown them in time of peaee, bat
cannot afford now! I can see no
good reaton for any other than
an affirmative reply to these ques
tions.
"The question as to whether or
not it is proper to make these al
lowances in times of peace is not
involved in this question. But
even if we consider it from that
viewpoint, there can be no ques
tion that this same provision of
the law has been used in the past
by the American Sagar R fining.

HUSBAND RESCUED
DESPAIRING WIFE
After Four Years of Discouraging
Conditions, Mrs. Bollock Gave
Up in Despair. Husband
Came to Rescue.
Catron, Ky.—In an interesting letter
from this place, Mrs. Bettie Bullock
writes as follows : "I suffered for four
years, with womanly troubles, and during
this time, I could only sit up for a little
while, and could not walk anywhere at
all. At tim«, I would have severe pains
In my left side.
The doctor was called in, and his treat
ment relieved me for a while, but 1 was
won confined to my bed again. After
that, nothing seemed to d any good.
I had gotten so weak I could not stand,
and I gave up in despair.
At last, my husband got me a bottle of
Cardui, the woman's tonic, and I com
menced taking It From the very first
dos«, I could tell It was helping me. I
can now walk two miles without its
tiring me, and am doing all my work."
If you are all run down from womanly
troubles, don't give up in despair. Try
Cardui, the woman's tonic. It has helped
more thin a million women, In its 50
years of continuous success, and should
surely help you, too. Your druggist has
sold Cardui for years. He knows what
it will do. Ask him. He will recom
mend it. Begin taking Cardui today.
