Man on Streets Makes
Foozzle
(By GEO. H. WYATT.)
"Now," said Chief Phillips this
morning, while speaking of the recent
raids upon the Joy riders and corner
cutters, and smiling at the time one
of those guileful smiles. "I think after
the manner in which you have been
interviewing me and other members
of the police force am' talking about
the Jay drivers and the Joy driver
and the corner cutters, it would be no
more than right for you to drop
around) and interview a few of the
genilemen who have been interview
ed by the mayor in the matters above
alluded to interviewed by the nayor
while he posed as a rugged dispenser
of Justice, ready-made and delivered
ftliile you wait, to any and all Joy
riders."
The Man on tho Streets demurred
to the suggestion of the Big Chief. Ho
said, by way of argument, favoring
the sustaining of his demurrer tha;
he did not believe the "culprits" cared
to be interviewed. But the Big Chief
overruled the demurrer with another
of those smiles which, for childlike
Hamlness had Bret Heo.rte's heathen
Chinee, beaten at the post.
"I assure you' said the Big Chief,
"that every gentleman who has
been liberal-minded enough to kick in,
at Mayor Ceffman's request, in tho
matter of helping a good thing along
:v. tho sum of five bones will be glad
lo be interviewed."
Now, the Man on the Streets had
a hunch that the Big Chief might be
giving him a proper steer, although he
doubted the smile of sauvity and per
onfied urbanity, which began under
the chief's nose and lost itself behind
either ear.
, So, a little later in the day the Man
on the Streets tip-toed into the sanctu
ary of a local money changer and.
approaching him warily, stood at at
tention. Fortunately, perhaps, for all
concerned, a fellow citizen of an ad
venturous turn of mind and an inquir
ing cast of features edged in between
the Man on the Streets and the money
wholesaler.
"Ben," asked the inquisitive one,
"what might be ono hundred bones
worth for ninety days Eince the last
five dollar episode with the mayor?"
The Man of the Streets hesitates to
repeat the answer; to translate it;
to even seek to give you an inkling
of it. He will state, however, that in
pursuing the various vocations which
have connected him with meal tick
ets at different times and in differ
ent places on this mundane sphere,
the Man on the Streets has handled
CATCH TWO
WITH GOODS
On the same train boarded by J. J.
Baxter and C. Hurst at El Reno at an
early hour this morning, were Depu
ties Hugh Hogue and John Bailey,
who were returning to Chickasna
from McAlester where they had been
to deliver a bunch of prisoners to th'j
warden of the pen. When all parties
detrained at Chickasha the officers
thought tho grips of the above named
gentlemen looked rather suspicious.
Hence it was that grips and grip es
corts were taken into custody and
carried Jailward.
Search of the grips brought to light
14 quarts of liquified disturbance, ail
corked and sealed and sparkling in
the electric light A further search of
the prisoners, personally conducted by
Sheriff Bailey is said to have develop
ed tho fact that each prisoner had
'something on his hip." Awaiting a
bearing on charges of transporting,
Baxter and Hurst are at present oc
cupying quarters at tho sumptuous Jail
of Grady county.

After having safely gotten out of
the presence of the peeved individual,

a full five minutes, in an effort to seo
whether the flow of oral vitriol had

"What did he say?" whispered the

BOOM IS

Undergoing Legitimate Expansion;
Standard Oil Securities Show
Gain of 148 Millions
CONSUMPTION IS
CLOSE TO SUPPLY
Prospect Output Next Year Will Be Une

Gallons ot Gasoline are Used
in Year
By United Press.
NEW YORK, Feb. 12. The rising
price of ' gasoline and other oils and
dispatcher from Washington indicat
ing that congress may take an active
interest in conditions in the oil busi
ness, lend interest to Wrilliam J.
Smallwood's statement today of why
he thinks the oil industry in this coun
try is on the eve of the biggest legiti
mate boom in its history. Smallwood
is oil expert for Carl H. Pferzheimer
& Co., dealers in oil securities in Wall
street. Smallwood bases his state
ment on the, recent expansion in the
oil business and the higher prices
of gasoline. In two weeks recently
the securities of the 36 Standard Oil
companies appreciated over $V48,0OO,
I'OO in value, due primarily to the sud
den improvement in the oil trade.
"Conditions in the oil trade are
now very similar to those which pre
vailed in 1912 and 101", except tbat
the use of petroleum products since
that time has become more general,"
asserted Smallwood. "The period fol
lowing the dissolution of the. Standard
Oil company in 1911, up to 1913 was
more profitable than any previous
time in the oil industry.
The discovery of the most wonder
ful hieh grade oil pool ever known
was made early 1914. This pool, which
Is known as the Cashing in Oklahoma
fields, increased its output until a
maximum of 3rt0,0O0 barrels a day waJ
reached, which meant that over 100,-
(,00,000 barrels a year had been added
to the company's supply. The result
was that crude oil prices went tumb
ling, Oklahoma oil dropped from Jl.Os
to 40 cents a barret.
"But the situation now Is entirely
changed from what it was a year ago
Last year there was a flood of oil.
Now the consumption is running so
near the supply that not only have
prices of crude oil, and in turn re
fined oil. greatly increased, but there
is a danger that next year will see
the output unequal to the demand.
. Consumption is now running abou
a billion and a half gallons of gaso
line a year; next year the consump
tion will be near two billion gallons.
"To prepare for the expected big
business in 1916 many of the Standard
Oil companies are rushing additions
and extensions to their plants. The
Solar Refining company is building a
$1,000,000 addition at Lima, O., and
this is only a two million dollar con
cern. Standard Oil of Indiana is in
creasing its capacity and when the
improvements now under way are
completed they will have cost several
millions. So is the Standard Oil of
Kacsas extending its works. In fact,
all of tho oil companies are preparing
for a boom this year.
"And the most gratifying feature
of the oil situation is that its pros
perity does not depend on the war. In
fact, increased business is likely to
follow the close of the war. One of
the very large consumers of petro
leum in the future will be the mer
chant marine and contracts have al
ready been made for the extensive
use of fuel oil for transcontinental
liners. The adoption of these con
tracts only awaits the culmination o!
the war." . , .
