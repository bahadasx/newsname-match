The latest evidence gathered by the Thompson Legislative Com
mittee establishes that instead of the dly beginning to share in the profits
of the new subway extensions in from five to seven years, as the Board
of- Estimate Transit Committee figured, it will be ten or fifteen years
before the city is a profit-sharing partner if the prevailing conditions are
allowed to continue.
On the face of the testimony taken by the Thompson Committee
it appears that the city has been deliberately jobbed. Bonuses and other
payments charged up to "construction" will, unless the city administra
tion Interferes as the Mayor has promised coutiibute toward a huge
deficit which will be charged against the city.

MUNICIPAL GARBAGE PLANT A
BLOW TO QILLESPIE.
Tho Lockwood Dili provided for nn

tho city to make n radical change In
tha method ot disposal of all kinds of
garbage, rubbish nud ushos.
Flvo mothods wero outlined. One,
providing for tho municipal construc

posal plant, entailed an outlay of
19,000,000, and was, of course, out of
the question.
Another, favored by all tlio city
authorities and advanced by Street
Cleaning Commissioner Fothorston,
Involved a partnership between tho
city und a contractor to run for fifteen
years, tho clty'fi Investment to bo
(2,SOO,000, tho contractor's JO, 600,000,
tho contractor to stand any Joss and
to sharo profits with tho city in pro
portion to tho capital Invested. At
tho expiration of fifteen yonrs tho
whole plant was to revert to tho city,
It was planned, it tho hill had not
been votood by Gov. Whitman, to
have the plant In operation by Jan. 1,
1017, when tho current contract with
tlio Now York Disposal Corporation
expires. Tho project contemplated tho
readjustment of garbage, ashes and
rubbish collection In the ontlre city
and It was estimated that thosavlng

amounted to $100,000 n yenr.

that It woe Idontlcal with tho aermnn

that Hccrctury Lansing at least will

Ho has always requested that they

So It Is with tho Hntentn nllles, ac
