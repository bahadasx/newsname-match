H Petrograd, Feb. 12, via London,
H 5:17 p. m. The Russian offensive

B The Germans, according to advices

H the defensive on three important riv

fl crossing of the Dneister at Usciecsko
fl v.'here their troops are firmly en

the effect of interrupting one of the
most important lines of communica

Russians Rout Hungarians.
A third important Russian advance
Iipk been recorded near Znle Szczyky,
v.liere a fierce counter attack is de
clared to have been successful in rout
ing the opposing forces and demoral
izing the Hungarian troops to such
an extent that they retired to a new
line four miles to the rear In ad
dition to these breaches announced
to have been made in the opposing
lines the Russians have been active
immediately to the northward of
Tamopol, where they have moved
slightly forward.
While it is admitted that these op
1 orations have no immediate strategic
L alue, it is believed-in mllitarycir
it clc? here that the new Russian of
' fcnsive has prevented the Germans
from withdrawing troops from this
i front, thereby lessening the chances
of successful attacks on allied hues
elsewhere.
The initiative on the Dvinsk front
remains in German hands, but the
imlcl weather of the last month,
threatening with inundation the
trenches built by the Germans on
f marshy ground, is seriously handicap
' ping their efforts to move forward.

ber of French prisoners are employed

' Loudon, Feb. 12, 9:15 a. m The
Manchester Guardian in an editorial
on the German memorandum regard
ing armed merchantmen says:
"Germany's announcement of her
intention to treat armed merchantmen
as warships after March 1 Is to bo
read in connection with the proposals
hich the United States government
recently made to the belligerents."
The edltorinl argues that Washing
ton proposes a bargain the entente
side of which is clear, namely the
I surrender of the right to arm mer-
1 chantmen, but the Germau side ot
I which Ib not clear. The United States
therefore, it says, "ca nonly think it

cf a bargain. Presumably the United

gestions to meet this difficulty."

One Battlefront and One
Only for Allied Forces.
Paris, Feb 12, 2 a. m. A Havas dls-
patch dated February 11, says that at
I the official dinner given in the French
embassy, the addresses delivered bv
French Premier Briand and Italian
Premier Salandar deal chiefly with
tho closer future relations of the al
lies in the conduct of the war.
"It is In this union." said M. Briand,
"which is each day becoming closer
both in our military enterprises, and
in all the phases of our economic
struggle against our enemies, that a
sure guarantee of victory lies "

will be counter-acted if for the allies
there are no longer many battle

BELGIAN PRIMATE
A POLITICIAN
Germans Regard Cardinal
as Agitator and Circulator
of Untruths.
Berlin. Feb. 12, by Wireless to Say
ville. The following statement re
garding the activities of Cardinal Mer
cier, primate of Belgium who is now
on a visit to Rome, was made public
today by the Overseas News Agency.
"The lteer which Cardinal Mercler
and the Belgian bishops addressed to
the German clergy on November 24,
1915, (regarding an investigation of
allegations that atrocities had been
committed In Belgium by Germans)
did not reach Cardinal von Hartmann,
archbishop of Cologne, until January
7, which explains why it has not been
answered. The general impression
prevailing In Germany, however, is
that the letter was inspired entirely
by Cardinal Mercier, whose intransl
ent attitude toward the German au
thorities became manifest onvarlous
occasions.
"Before the war, Cardinal Mercier
was an influential Belgian politician.
For example, at the time of King Leo
pold's death he sided publicly with
the party in favor of colonial expan
sion in the notorious Congo affair, de
manding an increase In the Belgian
army After the occupation of Bel
gium by German forces the cardinal
preserved a similar attitude, using
the influence of the clergy for agita
tion of a purely political nature
Ordered Prayers For Entente.
"At the time of the great Anglo
French offensive the cardinal ordered
that in all church of Belgium prayers
be said for the victory of the entente
forces At the same time on St Mich
ael's Day he published a pastoral let
ter comparing the struggle with that
of St. Michael, the patron saint of
Belgium, and Lucifer, suggestion in
transparent tashion that he did not
compare Germany with the Angel
"During religious ceremonies in the
fall, Cardinal Mercier declared to Bel
gian, priests, assembled in the Malines
seminary, that they :re .all -.obliged
to offer tho greatest possible resist
ance to the Germans.
"The letter of tho Belgian bishops
also discusses the allegation that Ger
man soldiers attacked Belgian nuns
When requested to Investigate this
charge, Cardinal Mercier declined on
the ground that he did not wish to
hurt ony one's feelings. But the
bishops of Liege, Namur, Bruges and
Ghent declared that no such misdeeds
had some to their knowledge.
"All this corroborates the German
Impression that the liberties granted
freely to Cardinal Mercier in the in
terests of his exalted priestly vocation
are being used by him merely for pur
poses of political agitation which pla
ces the German authorities in an
awkward position "

Rio do Janeiro. Feb. 12. The Ger

proach a wharf to take water aboard.
Under cover of the fog she turned
