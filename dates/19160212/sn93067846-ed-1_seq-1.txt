matic Sea Battle Between
and Roon.
New York, Feb. 9.?Advices
ceived here today assert that the Gt
.man warship Roon, alleged to be
captor of tho Appam, has been
?cured by tho British armored crul
Drake after a *hree hour fight
miles east northeast of Bermuda,
cording to a story printed by the N{
York Evening Globe.
The capture of the Roon is said^to
have been followed by seizure of tjjr o
merchantmen flying the Gerrttjtn
flag, one of which was armed.
The story is contained in a message
which The Globe states it received
in code from a reliable source in Bf
muda The message reads:
"Drake here today towing Roibn.

muda, three hours running fight
Danforth 18 men. Her losses ab<

Seagrave on sighting Roon salfd:
?Pleuse God, today I will avenge
Cradock.' Roon badly knocked ab*}ut
by 9.2. Thirty-two officers and ;'TJ9
.?cn taken in the three prises."
The Seagrave mentioned in
message is supposed to be Capt,. I
grave, who was with Admiral Crat
when the latter went down wit!
flagship, the Good Hope, whiol
sunk in an engagement with,
man squadron off Chile.
There is no Danforth among
officers in the British navy lkftjg

ron in the battle off Chile.
Orama escaped and later in
with the cruisers Glasgow

agmesll:
her. The Orama was last report*
at Callao In June, 1916.
For several days repots have been

British. The British consulate, how?
ever, has received no official confirma?
tion.
ONLY PRIVATE ADVICES.
Washington, Feb. 9.?The British
embassy today received advices from
British agents in New York that a
man living on ?taten island, whose

vices.

Hamilton, Bermuda. Feb. 9.?If a
battle has taken place between the
British armored cruiser Drake and the
German cruiser Roon off Bermuda

rence. Numerous inquiries have fail?
ed to confirm the report that the
Drake attacked and captured tho
Roon. These vessels havo not reach?
ed this port, and, so far as can be
learned, no advices have been received
at Hamilton to indicate that the
Drake has taken a prize into any other
Bermuda port.

Mil TO HEAD TRADE BODY.
CHARLESTON MAN REGARDED
AS NEXT PRESIDENT OF NAT?
IONAL CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE.
Secretaries Garrison and Daniels to
Speak on Subject of National De?
fense.
Washington, Feb. 9.?Wholesale
inaccuracies in government export
statistics were admitted today by
Secretary Redfleld, of the department
of commerce, in a speech before tho
Chamber of Commerce of the United
States. He said, however, that by an
order issued February 1 he had reme?
died the situation so far as was in his
power, and that the gross errors of
the past, caused by refusal of shippers
to give the government facts and by
antiquated laws, would not be re?
peated.
The secretary referred to a charge
made a month ago by officials of the
Chamber that the percentage of er?
rors in departmental reports was so
great it was impossible even for ex?
perts to estimate it; that single car?
goes running into thousands of dol?
lars in value left American ports with?
out being recorded and that the pub?
lished export figures for 1914 fell far
short of the actual exports. He said
this probably understated the case.
There was but slight inaccuracy in im?
port statistics, he added, as returns on
imports were more fully under govern?
ment control.
"Such errors as have existed in re?
cording exports," said ho, "are prob?
ably understated. The business of
compiling figures of $5,000,000,000 a
year, under a law of 1820, is not a
simple matter. The errors have been
caused wholly by shippers who were
unwilling to state the facts. I wel?
come your cooperation. You are my
Witnesses that there are no closed
doors in the department qf commerce.
So long an I have anything to do with
that department, if there is anything
of concealment, I will show it up.'*

Cormick, Baltimore. The directors
will meet probably tomorow to elect

S. C, is regarded as the probable suc?
cessor to John H. Fahey, tho retir?
ing president.

ONE HILLED, ONE WOUNDED.
THEODORE UPTON RUNS AMUCK
ON GREEK ROAD.
Lafoy Minis is Slain?Waddell Shot
Through Should r?No Explanation
of Mill Employe's Strange Conduct.
Spartanburg, Feb. 7.?Theodore H.
Upton, an employe of the Appalachia
mill, near Greer, who ran amuck on
the highway leading from Greer to
the mill early Sunday mroning, killing
Lafoy Mims of Greenville county and
wounding A. B. Waddell of Greer, is
in jail here awaiting an investigation
of his strange conduct. Upton is a
married man and is said to have sev?
eral childre v siding at Appalachia.
Sunday nif" M appeared on the
highway r g out from Greer, with
a gun in '?) land, demanding of
those W7 xu met what right they
~ ?
had on :? oad. He fir-st encountered
A. B. ? dell, against whose stom?
ach y ? irust his gun, which Wad
dellr 40 iched from his hand, but
late Aimed it to Upton, to have
hi' /again covered, and this time
% ad in the shoulder. Frightened,
At. put off for an officer, but
before he had gone far Upton came
upon three men, Lafoy Mims, John
Walker and Cliff Brown. He demanded
of these that they throw up their
hands, which they did, but in spite
of their disposition to surrender Upton
fired upon Mims, shooting him
through the heart and killing him in?
stantly.
In so far as has been developed by
the police Upton had nothing against
Mims and it is possible that he did not
know him. After the killing Upton re?
mained at the spot, having thrown his
gun away in the meantime, and was
there when the officers came to take
him in charge.
The inquest held today failed to
throw any light upon the motives of
Upton. The case is regarded as one
of the strangest in the criminal affairs
of the county.
