To Young Ladies Only.
Which will you do, Win your
Independence or Marry a
Two-bit Man?
You are at the cross roads of life
There are two paths open to you.
One leads to your independence,
the other to dependency. You are
to choose, which of these roads you
prefer to travel. One requires.
effort, the other indifference. To
travel one, you must have real
back bone and determination, the
other, a string for a back bone,
and indifference will do. Some
girls say "The lion is in the way."
These girls like gumption, get-up
and-get, they reason that if so-and
so and such-and such a thing had
not happened they could have
made a greaf success. The lion is
in the way. Fear and indifference
has entered into their daily life
and robbed them of their vim and
courage. It's our life work to
train people to determine to get up
and do things, develop their late
talents, quicken their perception
that they may lead a higher and
more useful life. Our thorough
practical training in Bookkeeping.
