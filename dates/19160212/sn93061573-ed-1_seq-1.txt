I
DEMOCRACY MUST FIGHT "JIMMY," SOFT
SOAP, STEAM ROLLER AND MAILED FIST
"We know what we have to light,"
said Judge E. V. Long, to the Demo
cratic state central committee yes
terday. (Feb. I.)
It is well that the Democracy
reali.e what it has to fight. It has
to fight an organization which has
intrenched itself by cunning and
manipulation for tho past two de
cades. It has to fight an organiza
tion which feeds the public on glit
tering promises during the campaign
and tells the public to go to the
devil when it makes the laws. It is
ati organization which does not
scruple to play upon slumbering race
feeling, and to fan it into flames
to further its own selfish purposes.
It is an organization which gets in
by subterfuge and stays in by bull
dozing. It is an organization which
professes deep reverence for the
grand old constitution during the
ante-election period and make a
football of the unhappy document
when it gets into power. It is an or
ganization whose leaders have been
notorious fur twenty years in this
state for slipperiness and chicane,
who have herded voters and bought
ballots by the thousand: it is the
hunch of the jimmy, of the stuffed
club and the bludgeon, the soft soap
and the steam roller, of the bullcon
and the hot air, the mailed fist and
the itching palm which works while
you sleep and works you while you
ire awake.
CAMEL ROPED WITH PIECE
OF PAPER AGAIN IN LIMBO
lourt Order Restrains Sheriff from
Closing Walters Saloon, but
Favorite Is Dry.
The camel is again in capliity.
He was roped with a court order
Monday morning and transferred to
his jug, to languish, temporarily at
least, on a diet of water and await
his chance to kick more dents in
the thirst parlor mop boards.
Both E. J. Walters and Juan Car
rillo opened their places for busi
ness Monday morning after Toombs
Harris procured a court order re
straining officers from closing the
saloons because they were too close
to a church. Juan Carrillo remained
open for one day but was closed be
cause, it is said, the proprietor vio
lated that part of the law pertain
ing to the posting of certain sections
of statutes governing retail liquor
business. E. J. Walters' place is still
open, and we understand will remain
so pending decision of the courts
regarding the distance between his
place and the church.
Gremille Boy Qualifies as Sharp
shooter In an official bulletin issued by
headquarters, United States Marine
Corns. Washington, appears the
√ç nnttin rf Alrrm flMlinm ft iPftrivillii
this county, as having qualified as a
sharpshooter in that most interest
ing branch of the government ser
vice. Algin, who is a son of William L.
Oldham, of Grenville, enlisted in
tho United States Marine Corps at
its Denver, Colo., recruiting station
of April 26, 1915, and is now serving
at the marine barracks, naval sta
tion, Guam, Marianna Island, where
he is having many interesting ex
periences and adventures.
Considering tho fact that Oldham
is scarcely more than a recruit, his
performance in gunnery is consid
ered by Marine Corps officials as lit
tle short of marvelous, and they ex
pect him to break many marksman
ship records before his enlistment
expires.
Everybody knows that the end of
the chapter has to come some time.
It will be a red-letter day when
it does come. The Democracy has
a great chance this year to hasten
the day. Only by drawing the issue
sharply between the republican ma
chine leaders and their corporate
aid on one side and the common,
ordinary, doctor, lawyer, merchant,
grocer, farmer and ranchman on
the other and fighting it out on that
line can the opposition win. The
question is to whether the influen
tial and cynical few or the plugging
many are going to run things in
this state; whether we are going to
have government in the open or
government by subterfuge. The in
dependent voters are silently and
unobtrusively increasing. As they !
continue to increase and continue
to think they are going to line up
with any political organization that
is clearly and cleanly for progress
and for freeing the state from the
grip of the selfish influences which
have so long held the upper hand.
The Democrats have a great chance
this year. The dissatisfaction and I was "not a speaker" and Messrs.

M. L. Sovil of Sedan writes The

tho county, part of which we pub
lish: School house No. 43 has been fin
ished and painted on the inside, and
au organ installed, which gives Ihe
house a more cozy appearance.
Louis Holcomb has a well close to
the school house, which makes it
very convenient for the school to
procure its water. Mr. Holcomb also
has a corral built, and his feed
stacked near his well. I understand
that he intends to build a residence
in the not distant future.
One mile south of the Holcomb
ranch Charles Kinderman, within the
past year, has located and is build
ing a home. He already has a wind
mill and large barn and contem
plates building a splendid residence
in the near future.
Geo. Lewis of Vance, who settled
his claim within the past twelve
months, has built a residence that
can be seen for miles; it is not paint
ed yet, but Mr. Lewis is living in
it. and is well pleased with the
country.
Popular Young Folks Wed
Wheeler Hill, of Clayton and Miss
Mildred Scarlott, of Mt. Dora, sur
prised their friends, when without
any advance notices, they were
quietly married Saturday by Rev.
Gains. The couple left for Amarillo
tho same evening.
Mrs. Hill, until her marriage, was
postmaster at Mt. Dora where sho
is very popular. Sho is an accom
plished young lady and Mr. Hill is
to be envied. So is Mrs. Hill, in
fact we believe tho union should
have unanimous good wishes of ev
erybody. Mr. Hill is the junior member of
Hill Brothers transfer business and
is one of Clayton's most prosperous
young business men.

Entertain Crowd in North New
.Mexico's Finest House.
North New Mexico's prettiest aad
most modern theater was opened (
the public Monday night. More tham
000 people were present to witness
its debut. Before 7:30 tho house was
"sold out" and the auxiliary chairs
put into service.
When the curtain made its formal
rise three of Union county's promin
ent citizens were disclosed ready te
formally introduce "the house." They
were M. llerzstein, owner of the
Mission, O. 1. Easterwood and Juaa
J. Duran, speakers of the evening.
Mr. Easterwood made a 6hort aad
entertaining speech, entirely in keep
ing with the occasion. Mr. Dura
addressed the audience in Spanish,
both speeches were the proper
length to exactly suit the tastes ef
an entertainment seeking crowd.
Frequent calls from the crowd for
Mr. llerzstein brought him to the
center of the stage where he made

A fair sized crowd turned out te
hear G. W. Kirkpatrick, socialist,
; lecture Sunday night. Mr. Kirk

a far better orator, putting up a
more convincing plea for his cause.
Ryan Walker, the well known car

night. This is the last of the series
and will doubtless prove the most
interesting.
James Announces-as Candidate
Thomas P. James stopped off at
Clayton last week while enroute to
Hot Springs, Ark., and from that
point wrote us that his hat was in
ring for county commissioner from
District No. 1. He stated that a
number of peoplo had importuned
him to mako the race, and he had
finally made up his mind to go In
and win if ho could get the Demo
crats to regard himself as the best
can'didato and can then get enough
votes to win tho election.
The Democrats will make no mis
take by putting a man of Mr. Jame
known ability and integrity on the
ticket. The peoplo of the north cad
of the county can bo depended upom
to give him an. almost solid support
for election if he receives the nom
