ment of Continental Army
ASSISTANT ALSO QUITS HIS JOB
Washington, Feb. 10—Lindley
M. Garrison, Secretary of War, to
day tendered his resignation to
President Wilson and it was ac
cepted. Refusal of the President
to insist upon acceptance of the
continental army plan generally
opposed in Congress, and Mr. Gar
rison's disapproval of the Philip
pine independence bill as it pass
ed the Senate are understood to
have been responsible for his deci
sion to quit the cabinet.
The resignation of Henry C.
Breckinridge, Assistant Secretary
cf War, was also announced at the
White House tonight at 8 o'clock,
when it was officially announced
that Secretary Garrison's resigna
tion had been accepted by the
President.
The President took the position
that he could not dictate details
of an army plan to Congress. He
conferred today with Republican
members of the House Military
Committee, who informed him that
Democrats and Republicans alike
on the committee were opposed to
the continental army scheme and

population will be doubled before

Favors Continental Army
President Wilson has supported
the continental army scheme and
continues to believe that it is the
best plan for strengthening the
army. He has made it plain, how
ever, in speeches and in talks with
Congressional leaders that the
main thing is to get a large re

and that the details must be work

The President and Secretary
Garrison have been close personal
friends since the administration
came together and have stood to
gether on practically every ques

Secretary Garrison has been a
leading figure in President Wil
son's official family ever since the
administration began. To his urg

Wilson's determination to carry to
the country his plea for adequate
national defense.

LUSITANIA ADJUSTMENT NEWS
German Reply Satisfactory
in Substance
Washington, D. C., Feb. 10.
Germany's latest proposal in the
Lusitania case having proved, in
substance, satisfactory to the Un
ited States, final settlement of the
controversy is expected within a
few days.
Some alterations, however, in
the form of the agreement, regard
ed as minor ones, are to be made
to meet the wishes of the Ameri
can government and involve the
dispatch of the proposal again to
the Berlin Foreign Office. One of
the changes, it is stated, authori
tatively, is that the communication
shall specifically include the state
ment. that it was in answer to the
last American note.
The changes were suggested to
Count von Bernstorff, the Germau
Ambassador, by Secretary Lans
ing, yesterday, after President
Wilson and his Cabinet had gone
over the latest proposal of Ger
many. The Ambassador immedi
ately afterward submitted the
whole matter by cable to the Ber
lin government for final approval.
It is expected that a reply will be
forthcoming in about six days.
In Teutonic diplomatic circles
the belief is expressed that the
proposed changes will be accepted
by the Berlin Foreign Office.
One of the changes in the Lusi
tania agreement suggested by Sec
retary Lansing to Count von Bern
storff is the substitution of the
Mords "recognizes liability" for
the words "assumes liability."

tive draft.
It is understood that upon this
change and, others described also
as minor is based the expressed
view of high officials that the two
governments are "substantially in
accord," although not wholly so.
No new difficulty is expected
here from the change of words. It
is felt that Germany could not or
would not assume a liability which
she would not recognize. It is not
believed here that Berlin officials
will hesitate to accept the sugges
tion.
It was not disclosed just when
American officials determined that
the recognition instead of the as-
sumption of liability was more to
be desired. . The understanding,
based upon authentic information,
had been that the assumption of
Lability was contained in the ten
tative proposal which had embod
ied in it all the wording the Unit
ed States desired and in which the
German government substituted a
phrase for the word ''illegal."
From one quarter came the sug
gestion that the word "recogniz
es" makes clearer the meaning the
German government desires to
convey. It has not been suggested
it was said, that either the word il
legal or legal be employed in the
formal communication, the under

the two governments concerned in

ADVERTISERS |
Washington, Pa., Feb. 10—Ger
many and Austria through their
embassies here have notified the
United States of their intention tq
treat armed merchantmen as war
ships after March 1. That date was
fixed to give the Entente allies
time to signify their intention to
ward the recent note of the United
States proposing the disarmament
of all merchantment.
The notification of the German
ic powers while delivered orally
was formal and it was said that
because of difficulties of communi
cation with the United States, for
mal notice in writing will be de
livered to the American embassies
in Vienna and Berlin.
Disarmament Suggested
The United States recently pro
posed to all the belligerents that
the development of submarine
warfare had made it desirable for
all to agree that merchant ships
dismounting even the small cali
ber guns which they have hereto
fore been permitted to carry in de
fense.
The memorandum went forward
by mail about two weeks ago and
no replies were expected inside of
six weeks. The proposal was bas
ed on the theory that no merchant
ships of the Germanic powers and
none of their destroy
ers except submarines were at sea.

Sets forth Claims to Repub- *

In a letter printed elsewhere in

of Indiana, announces his candi

sets forth that he was instrumen

nating rule between Indiana and
Jefferson counties, which was rat
ified by the county committees of
both counties, and then stepped
aside for the sake of harmony in
the interest of another candidate;
that eight years later he did the
same thing and that now he thinks
it is about his time.
Mr. Watson is well known to
the people of this senatorial dis
trict, having figured largely in po
litics in Indiana county, serving
three terms in the legislature and
being widely known as an attor
ney. He is a man of undoubted
ability and has always had large
