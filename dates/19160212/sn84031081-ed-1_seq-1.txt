Washington, Feb. 11. A new note
of liannony and co-operatlon on na
tional defense problems was struck
in tlie house military committee to
day as a direct result ot the reslgna-tP-ii
of Secretary Garrison of the war
department. It found expression In
the adoption of a resolution declar
ing the committee's appreciation of
the confidence l'resident Wilson re
posed in it and in the senate commit
tee, as disclosed in his correspondence
with Mr. Garrison.
The nonpartisan character of the
feeling was emphasized by the fact
that the resolution was offered by
Representative Kahn, of California.
runkiiiK republican member of the
committee.
Situation larlfios.
.Members of both the eongression
al committees declared that, the war
secretary's withdrawal had brought
out sharply the president's desire th.'it
congress should work out its army
problems in tile lig'ht of its own best
judgment, despite- his personal pn f
crotieo for the continental army
si heme advocated by Mr. Garrison
and the unity war college. The net
result, they agreed, was a clarification
of the congressional atmosphere and
the assurance of support for the bills
that will bo drafted from elements
Done.
Provision also will bo made under
which the quota of troops to be fur
nished by each state and the propor
tions of artillery, cavalry, engineer-',
signal corps and other special service
troops would be determined by the
war department. Special federal ap
propriations will be proposed for the
I maintenance of these more costly spe
cial arm troops by the states.
The situation in the senate commit
tee is not so well crystallized. It is
indicated, however, thai its Ionization

ficers at the end of a year's training
undoubtedly will be among the plum
proposed to accomplish this end.
ItiKK'r Standing Army. ;
As to the size of the standing army,,
the men with the colors, it is indicnt-j
ed that the senato bill will exceed thej
increase of 40,(100 men asked by See-;
rotary Garrison and many senators,
will una- the full "SO.OOO total 1
strength sought by the war college.
Chairman Chamberlain has prepared a
bill carrying nut the plan of l'.'U', de
vised by the war college, and which
vould provide a lone with too colors;
of approximately L'nO.OliO men.
It was over this plan that Secretary:
Garrison and Senator Chamberlain
came into sharp disagreement last
year. The chairman of the senate
committee desired then that the war
departnn nt urge a complete reorgani
zation of the army an suggested by the
plan of UGH. Secretary Garrison,
however, presented u scries of bills de
signed strong! hor. what he con
ceived to be the weakest Mints In the

enacted to be followed Ki'nduiilly by
other bills to carry out the full plan.

Washington, Feb. 11. Iuplomatie
negotiations of various characters will
confront the 1'nited States as the re
sult of the expected Intention of the
German and Austrian governments to
treat armed merchant ships of the
entente allies as war vessels after Feb
ruary 2!".
Apparently it Is certain, if the tem
pi r of Ihe allied governments can be
Judged by the feelings of their diplo
matic rep resell t a I i ves bore, that any
attempt by the rnited States to
change the pn'scnt rule permitting
the use of American
ant ships armed for
poses will be met by
( 'orrespondonec also
low if the rnited States assumes a po
sition which coincides with that of
Germany and Austria regarding the
right of submarines lo sink armed
.'hips without warning.
On the other hand the rnited Stales
itself may take the initiative should
the entente allies Impose a virtual
boycott of American ports in the
event, of this government deciding that
armed merchant ships entering Amer
ican waters are ships of war, and
therefore suhjent to Internment.
Wait I'orinal Texts.
The definite attitude of the 1'nited
States toward the stated intention of
Germany and Austria will be determ
ined after the formal text of the notes
which have been handed to Ambas
sador Gerard and Ambassador Pen
field, ate received from Ilerlin and
Vienna. Unco the-texts are before of
fieials here it is believed the position
of this government quickly will be do.
fined. Duly eighteen days remain he
fore German and Austrian submarine
commanders will start to put their
new Instructions Into operation.
The view of at b ast some of the rep
resentatives of the entente allies here
is that any change made In the rule
bearing on submarine warfare during
the war would bo an unneutral act.
The governments are represented as
not bolim prepared to admit that there
has been any change In the condition
of naval warfare which would war
rant merchant ships armed for defen
sive purposes being characterized as
warships.
Problem ( oiiiplloulnl.
In Teutonic' quarters, however. It is
contended that merchant ships armed
for defensive purposes are really arm
ed for resistance and that merchant
ships have no right to resist. More
over, it is claimed by Germany that It
is impossible to adVie to the princi
ple of warning merchant ships, in ac
cordance with the views of the United
States, should they be armed; a sin
gle shell of small caliber being- suf
ficient to sink any submarine which
might attempt to warn such a vessel.
It is admitted submarines have a rilfht
to stop enemy armed merchantmen.
American officials seem InHined to
the View that the contentions of the
German and Austrian governments lire
well founded, and from seven, 1 quar
ters today came the Information that
the United States might warn its na
tionals to remain off merchant ships
that are armed. This, it was said in
German circles, was precisely what the
German and Austrian governments
have been aiming to achieve. ,
Would Not Permit. Iloycoll.
The possibility of the entente allies
putting into effect a practical boycott
of American ports was widely dis
cussed In official circles during- the
day. It has been intimated that the
allies might see fit to permit only a
sufficient number of th.ir unarmed
ships to enter American ports to take
away merchandise ami goods consign
ed to themselves. It was admitt 'd in
.iigh ofticial quarters that should sue),
a plan be put into effect, action of
Mime kind might have to be taken.
