HOPKINSVILLE
j EDITORIAL COMMENT. 5
i
ft- Hi Ki
the state-wide prohibition bill was
defeated in the House yesterday, 54
to 40. Representative R. A. Cook
spoke against it.
The Cologne Gazette publishes a re
port that on the occasion of the last
Zeppelin raid over England the
destroyers Eden' and Nich were sunk.
A bill declaring it a common nuis
ance for a saloon to keep open on
Sunday passed in the House Wednes
day 74 to 14. The surprising thing
is that 14 members had the nerve to
go on record against the bill.
Whoever originated that "Excise
Commission" idea, was a very poor
adviser to the Governor, who had
sense enough to drop it like a hot po
tato. The state already has an ex
cess of commissions, most of which
should be abolished.
John C. Sheehan, one time leader
of Tammany Hall, and former police
commissioner of New York, died
Wednesday at the age of 67. When
Richard Croker retired as the leader
of Tammany Hall he named Sheehan
as his successor,, but Sheehan was
subsequently deposed.
A delegation of negroes called upon
Mayor Buschemeyer, of Louisville,
and formally protested against the
production in the city of "The Birth
of a Nation. " The Mayor said lie had
no objections to the play, which was
'a recital of events during and follow
ing the Civil War and a true and
faithful portrayal of history.
Senate bill 283, introduced Tues
day, requires all conveyances to state
the true consideration therein. This
is intended to break up the custom of
concealing the extent of large real es
tate dealsby making the considera
tion "$1 and other valuable consider
ations." This will make the deed
books more interesting to county as
sessors than the latest novels.
Representative Neely, of West Vir
ginia, has caused a telephone girl to
lose her job on a charge that she
"leaked" his private conversations to
his political opponents. Neely must
be a new Congressman and a very
foolish one to talk politics over any
sort of a telephone. The, real poli
tician never talks business over a
phone and seldom writes a letter. Ho
goes to or sends for his man.
Charging that Louis D. Brandeis, as
counsel for the interstate commerce
commission in the 5 per cent advance
rate case, conceded in the cause of
the railroads to the fatal injury of the
public interest, Clifford Thome, rail
road commissioner of Iowa, and an
associate counsel in the rate case, ap
pealed to the judiciary subcommittee
not to recommend confirmation of
Mr. Brandeis' nomination to the su
preme court of the United States.
On the second page of this issue,
we publish the first summary of turn
pike mileage in Christian county ever
nublished. Dividing the county on a
lino drawn due east and west through
Hopkinsville, the southern half has
122 and the northern half 94 miles.
The figures arc approximately cor
rect, but subject to minor corrections.
Thev do not include numerous short
stretches of pike put in to repair "bad
ntoces" in roads not metaled. It will
ftbe seen that 57 per cent of tho pres-

The two vital points upon which
Secretary Garrison and President
Wilson differed were these: The Sec
retary favored compulsory enlistment
of regular army soldiers to increase uio
army, while tho President prefers to
incorporate tho national guards and
increase by voluntary enlistments.
riPfV.. U. Dl.llinrtinn ulinctinil tllf SfiC-
Eretary differed from the President,
in that he was opposed to granting
tho islands independence in tho near
future. Ho wanted to take the stump
to advocato his own views, which
would havo been inconsistent with
the administration's plans. Secretary
Garrison should have profited by tho
fate of Secretary Bryan and followed
rather than to try to lead. .
SECRETARY GARRISON
TENDERS RESIGNATION
Accepted Uy President. No auc-
fPQcm- To Nnmor1...Pr.e
May Take Charge.
SECOND OFFICER TO QUIT
Reason Is Failure of Wilson to
'Irrevocably' Support Con
tinental Army Plan.
Washington, Feb. 11. Secretary
of War Lindley M. Garrison resigned
yesterday because President Wilson
would not "irrevocably" support the
continental army plan, and because
he opposes the administration's pro
gram of setting a definite time for
Philippine independence.
President Wilson accepted the res
ignation and has not yet selected a
successor. The President himself
probably will take personal charge of
the administration's national defense
plans in congress.
Assistant Secretary Breckenridge
also resigned as a mark of loyalty to
his chief, whose view he shares. The
President accepted his resignation.
Both take effect immediately. Maj-or-General
Scott, chief-of-staff of the
army, automatically becomes secre
tary of war ad interim.
It is known that one of Secretary
Garrison's principal reasons for his
conviction that only a federal conti
nental army, instead of a reorganized
national guard, could bo the main
military dependence of.thc nation
was his belief that some day the
United States may be called upon to
defend the Monroe doctrine, and in
that event he foresaw that the nation
al guard might not be available for
use outside of the United States be
fore a declaration of war.
Upon tnat contention, on' the one
hand, that the continental army or
ultimately universal service was the
nation's only reliance, and the posi
tion on the other, that no one plan
could be enforced upon congress,
President Wilson and his secretary
of war parted official company.
HOWES REAPPOINTED
Secretary of State Names In
cumbent to Serve Until
March 15.
Frankfort, Ky., Feb. 11. Charles
J. Howes, appointed during the term
of C. F. Crecelius, as Assistant Secre
tary of State by reappointment of
James P. Lewis, on approval of Gov.
Stanley. Since the induction of Mr.
Lewis, who recommended William
Dingus, of Prestonsburg, for the
position, Mr. Howes has been acting
as assistant and keeping the executive
journal, but the Secretary of State
would not authorize Mr. Howes to
sign his name. The Secretary of
State this morning, however, appoint
ed Mr. Howes assistant until March
15, or until his successor is appointed
and approved by the Governor.
Gen. Wood in Atlanta.
Gen. Leonard Wood, commander
of the East, was in Atlanta Wednes
day to arouse enthusiasm in tho mili
tary training camp to be held at Fort
Oclcthorno beginning April 3. He
spoke at a luncheon given by the
chamber of commerce and reiterated
what ho has said about advantages to
be gained from such training. In
speaking of the cost, ho said it did
not amount to much, beingabout$8.50
for a uniform and tho deposit of $30
required by the government. At the
end of tho encampment $5 would be
returned, he said.
Gov. Stanley Signed Bill.
Gov. Stanloy on Thursday signed
the anti-pass bill, tho first law ho was
ever called upon to sign, using two
gold pens that he presented to tho
authors of tho bill, Sonabr A. E.
Stricklett, of Covington, and Repre

PASSED THE
MILLION MARK
Tobacco Sales Reach The Flood
Tide on Looce Floor
Market.
1,000,000 POUNDS IN WEEK
Slight Drop in Prices From
Last Week's General
Average.
The last week in January showed
650,000 pounds, last week 750,000
pounds and this week passes the mil
lion mark with 1,025,000 pounds of
tobacco sold on the loose floors.
As might have been expected the
dumping of this vast volume of to
bacco on the market would bring with
the deliveries some of the lower types
anu grades and there was a slight de
ii
crease in me general average price
for the week, but it is still well above
the season's average.
The receipts continue very heavy
day and night and the busiest places
in town are the various warehouses.
The amount paid for tobacco in the
city during the last three weeks was
about $125,000, to say nothing of the
contract sales, and this influx of ready
money has had a good effect in all
branches of business and there is an
easier feeling in business circles gen
erally. The stream of wagons pouring to
bacco into the city from every road is
coming from a radius of forty to fifty
miles, Logan, Todd, Muhlcnburg,
Christian, Trigg, Caldwell, Hopkins,
Lyon, Crittenden, in Kentucky, and
Cheatham, Montgomery, Stewart and
others in Tennessee. The turnpikes
are being appreciated fully and many
loads are not made up until they reach
the good roads. Light loads are
hauled to the nearest pike and then
doubled up to come to town. Some
is hauled through farms to get to a
pike.
The schedule of the prices for the
week was as follows:
Trash 52.50 to $3.75
Lugs 54.00 " 55.75.
Com Leaf $5.00 to $8.50.
Med Leaf $7.00 to $9.50.
Good Leaf $9.00 to $12.50
The following is the report for the
week:
Week ending Feb. 10, 1910. Unsold
stock Jan. 1, 1916, 237 hogsheads.

BREAK IN CABINET INTERESTS
Austro-German Order Trcafc
Armed Merchantmen as
Enemy Warships.
Germany and Austria-Hungary
purpose to treat as warships' after
February 29 all armed merchantmen,
of countries at war with the Teutonic
allies.
Berlin already has issued a mem
orandum to the neutral governments
to this effect, and Austria-Hungary
will immediately do likewise.
Neutral nations are informed of the
new order of things in the German
memorandum "that they may worn
their citizens against further entrust
ing their persons or property to
armed merchantmen belonging to
powers at war with the German em
pire." Alleged secret instructions by the
British admiralty for merchant ships
to fire on submarines is made tht
basis for Germany putting armed
merchantmen in the category of war
craft.
The American secretary of war,
Lindley M. Garrison has resigned and
his resignation has been accepted by
President Wilson. Mr. Garrison's
action was based largely on the ques
tion of "preparedness" and his is the
second retirement from the cabinet
for causes arising indirectly out of the
European war, William J. Bryan be
ing the other.
There has been no diminution hi the
severe fighting between the French
and the Germans in the Artois region
of France. Northwest of Vimy, Ber
lin says, a large section of a French
trench has been captured, while- near
Neuville craters previously lost to the
French were retaken. A few prison
ers and twenty-two machine guns al
so were taken.
Paris asserts that near La Foliej
southwest of Vimy, the Germans were
forced but of communicating trenches
they had occupied and also that two
strong attacks by the Germans
against the French between Neuville
and La Folic were repulsed, the Ger
mans being able to hold only one
mine crater.
Berlin admits that the French south
of the Somme river entered a section
of the German first line trenches.
In Volhynia and on the East Gahcu
frontier the Russians are strongly oil

the Russians succeeded in penetrating
Austro-Hungarian trenches, but titer
were ejected, while on the Bessmst
