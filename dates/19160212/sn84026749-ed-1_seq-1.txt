HfS VERACITY QUESTIONED
Prelate Called Political Agitator
by Gernians in Long-Delayed
Reply.
BERLIN (via wireless to BayvIUe),
Feb-t it Cardinal Merclers veracity
waa questioned In a semi-official state
ment Issued here today, replying to
the charges raadetby the Belgian prel
ate, n his famous pastoral letter, ac
cusing the Germans of various acts
against the people of Belgium.
The statement was the tlrst answer
to these accusations. It was explained
that the reply was delayed because tne
full .text of Cardinal Mtrder's letter
only reached Cardinal Hartmann at
Cologue on January 7. last.
Cardinal Mercler Is accused of using
the cloak of a prelate of the church to
opefate aa a political agitator and to
Incite the Belgian people to resistance
against Qermany. It Is further charged
that on .one occasion he compared uer
many with tho devil.
Seml-Offlclal Statement.
The semi-official statement follows:
"The letter of Archbishop Mercler and
the Belgian bishops of November 24,
WS, to the German archbishops only
reached Archbishop Cardinal Hartmaan
January 7, 1918, which explains 'the ract
that ,no ansrjr had been' given previ
ous to .this. time.
"The, general impression prevailing in
aermany, however. U
that the letter
... ...
waa Inspired exclusively by. Cardinal
MewUr.,wh,ose uncompromising, attl-
lu4e. toward the Germck ' authorities

publicly urged what he
called plcte
patrlotque.' siding with the party of
Colonial expansion In the notorious Con
go affair and demanding an increase of
the Belgian army.
"The Cardinal maintained a similar
attitude after Belgium' occupation
by German forces, using the clergy
lnfluenco .for the purposes of purely
political agitation. Thus, at the mo
ment of the great Anglo-French of
fensive, he ordere din all Belgian
churches within territory oecupled by
the Germans prayers for' the victory
of the allies. At the same time he
Subllsbed a pastoral letter on fit.

between SL Michael, the patron saint
of Brussels, and Lucifer, with the
present war and suggesting In thin-ly-veted
Janguttge that compared
Germany not with the angel. In an
other pastoral letter he said that tho
Gentians porness no legitimate au
thority and havo no claim to the es
teem of the Belgians, who owe their
affection and obedience to their King.
Ordered ResisteBce.
"Furthermore, the Cardinal during
religious practices In the fall, declared
In Malne'a Seminary to the assembled
Belgian priests .that all were obliged
to offer the greatest possible resistance
against the Germans.
"In competent circles here it Is point
ed out that in a letter Inspired by Car
dinal Mercler the assurance Is given
that a priest under Instructions from
Cardinal Plffo, prince archbishop at
Vienna, made an Investigation In Bel
gtum. which had disastrous results for
Germany. Cardinal Plffo, however, de
clared publicly that he never author
ised any priest to make such an Inves
tigation. "The letter to the Belgian bishops fur
ther discusses the charge that German
soldiers attacked Belgian nuns. Cardi
nal Mercler was urged to investigate
these chance but declined on the
ground that he did not want to hurt
anyone's reelings. The bishops of Liege,
unr, uruges, ana uneni, nowe7er,
declared such misdeeds had not come to
their knowledge.

ALLIES WILL RESIST
Notiew, Served They Vill Op-
port German PoMoy.
Notice has been served on the Beat
Department that Great Britain and
her allies will resist to the utmost aay
action by the United States in support
of the German policy bf treating armed
merchantmen as warships.
The State Department admitted today
that the ambassadors ot the entente
alUes had informally notified the United
Htates of the attitude or their govern
men(a with respect to the 'Sensing pro
posals for disarming merchantmen.
The position Great Britain, Trance,
July, Russia, and probably Japan, will
take; Is that It would be a breach of
neutrality on the prt of the United
States to classify armed merchant ves
sels aa warships.
No Action Taken By U. S.
Secretary Lansing will not admit, piat
the. United States has definitely de
cided to follow Its suggestions to the
allied powers by putUng these new reg
ulaUons Into force, and to follow tide
with warning to Amerloens to stay off
armed belligerent merchantmen.
It can be said on the highest author
ity, however,- that the United States is
giving gravest consideration to this line
of action.
Amhimidn'r Gerard cabled to the
State Department today a summary of
tne aerman manitesio ana saia ne was
cabling the full text He had been ad
vised by Ambassador Penfleld that the
Austrian manifesto was IdenUcal to
ih lulled hv Germany.
Tim nrltlah ambassador has notified
! Rtnta Deoartment that a renly may
be expected soon from hla government
to the armed merchantmen proposals.
The BrlUsh .note. It Is stated, will con
tend that the United States went on
record as admitting the right under in
ternational law of merchantmen to
carry small' guns for defensive purposes.
French Envoy To Se Lawlng.
The t'ronrh ambassador wilt present
to Secretary Lansing this afternoon
the refusal of his government. It Is
believed, to agree to tho proposals
looklntr to a general disarmament of
merchant vessels. The British am
bassador has already Indicated that
the British government will reject
the proposals. '
Secretary Lansing this morning
took occasion to declare that there
was nothing to Jurtlfy the assump
tion that the United States will form
ally subscribe to the German posi
tion that armed merchant vessels are
auxiliary ships of war and may be
attacked and sunk without warning,
LONDON, Feb. llThe allies, It waa
stited on good authority today, will
send a strong note of protest to the
United States If Secretary Lansing, as
forecast In cable dispatches, accepts the
German .policy regarding armed mer
chantmen, and holds that such vessels
must be treated as ehlps of war.
The protest will be based on the fact
that tno United States, after the out
break of tho war, announced that it
would permit merchantmen carrying
guns for defensive purposes to enter
American ports, To change this policy
In the mlddlo of the war. In the view
point of the allies, Is to commit an un
neutral act The London press today
expresses amaxement at reports from
Washington that the United States will
yield to Germany on the new question.
"Msybe a landslide in America in
November will sweep away Wilson, with
his trimming policies," said the Globe,
-In a caustic editorial.
''It It ts true that President Wilson
wilt warn Americans not to travel 'on
armed belligerent merchantmen at their
own risk. Germany can't wish for any
thing better,' savs the Manchester Dis
