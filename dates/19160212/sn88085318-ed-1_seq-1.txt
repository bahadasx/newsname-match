OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
At the last session of the legis
lature, the republican leadership
took pains to strip from Gover
nor Lister the power of appoint
ing this state's tax commission,
the body which fixes the tax on
railways and telegraphs. Several
plausible reasons were assigned,
but regardless of real reasons, the
deed was done, and the majority
power of the tax board placed
in the hands of the state's republi
can machine at Olympia.
Now comes the announcement
that the taxpayers of Stevens
county can help to pay for it.
The Great. Northern's taxes in this
county have been cvt —not by
Governor Lister, or his board, but
by the hoard which was put in
to replace Lister's board.
The Great Northern valuation
in Stevens county is this year cut
$183,60:3 on main line, the side
track valuation is also cut moro
than 50 per cent, the personul
property valuation on main line
is also cut 20 per cent, and the
personal property on sidetrack is
also cut more than 6U per cent.
There was a real reason for tak
ing the tax fixing power out of
Lister's hands and putting it in
the bands of the republican ma
chine.
We hesitate to question who
gol the money—but we know to
a certainty who will pay the dif
ference. The man on the small
farm is the man who pays the
highest ratio of taxes, and he w;ll
be the man to help pay the tax>'s
which are no longer paid by the
Great Northern railroad in this
county.
A railroad lobby is a nice thing
—for the railroad. Since Lister
drove the lobbyists from the
state capitol during his first legis
lature, it has been "anything to
beat Lister." The numerous
aspirants for the chance to beat
Lister this fall indicate that there
must; be something worth will 1"
in being a governor different from
Lister.
The four large organizations of
railway employes have combined
in a nation-wide movement to se
cure the 8-hour day. The move
ment is said to involve about
300,000 men, on 280.000 miles of
railway line. Officers of the
trainmen's organizations arc
quoted as saying that they will
not arbitrate, but that a general
strike will be called unless the B
hour day is granted. The rail
ways have already started a vig
orous campaign by letters, circu
lars, pamphlets, and in newspaper
interviews, to kill the movement,
iprting that the 8-hour day
would mean an increased payroll
of ■>:■> per cent, or $100,000,00.
But the 8-hour day is likely to
come even to the overalled or uni
formed employes of the roads.
The officers of the great railway
systems, the "higher-ups," the fi
nancial manipulators who have
waxed rich from business in
trigues in directors' parlors, have
1 :>npr had their 8-hour day— or
less. They have gutted the fi
nances of the railway systems for
their own individual gain, forget
ful alike of the stockholders
scattered in the little homes of
the country, and of the myriad
<if men who toil in hazardous oc
cupation! in the yards, in the
coaches, and on the tracks.
There is always a turning point.
That time seems to have come with
the railroads. Their years of
grafting record have brought
them the whirlwind. There is no
sympathy except for those who
have paid with their toil. Tho.se
who have received the pay--with
out the toil—should lie forced to
do the paying now.
Argument* against an 8-hour
day were considered seriously
years ago, Now the 8-hour day
is accepted—except by those last
few remaining members of the old
guard who demand all for them
selves, but wish nothing for their
hirelings.
The financial interests which
bent the ship purchase bill ad
vocated by President Wilson two
years au;o, will have small help
from the Washington State
Orange members this year. Pres
ident Kegley has taken up the
fight for a government merchant
marine, and has th*> following
signed letter in the last issue of
the official grange organ of this
state:
"Patrons: The fight as to wheth
er we should have a monopoly
owned merchant marine or ships
owned and operated by the gov
ernment for the henefit of all the
people is on in earnest. At the
last session of the state grange
resolutions were adopted demand
ing government-owned and op
erated ships, that our representa
tives in congress be notified of this
action and urged to work for
these reforms, and your worthy
master and executive committee
were instructed to use all honor
able means to make, the purpose
of these resolutions effective. See
pages 12:5 and 125 of Journal.
Now. therefore, pursuant to these
instructions, and in view of the
immediate urgency of the situa
tion. I urge all patrons, through
their granges and individually, to
write and petition their congress
men and senators and let them
know in no uncertain terms that
the farmers of Washington want
government-owned and operated
ships and are unalterably opposed
to ship subsidies in any form. —
C. 15. Kegley. state master."
The establishment of some kind
of ii tariff board is probable. The
efforts of the progressives to se
cure a non-partisan tariff board
-which would handle the tariff,
and the efforts of the republican!
years ago to maintain a tariff
board which should make reports,
and the past announcements of
President Wilson thai he would
favor such a board if one could
be secured which would be of any
real value, seem to have merged
into a general agreement thai a
tariff board can be established
which will be of value on tariff
matters.
The U. S. constitution prevents
any such board from assuming
powers of fixing tariffs, for that
right is left solely to the house of
representatives. The progressive
party, in its plea for a tariff
board, failed to get around that
difficulty. President Wilson some
time ago stated that all the ma
chinery and the men for such work
are already employed by the gov
ernment in the department of
commerce and labor and other de
partments, and that he really saw
no need for any action other than
the delegation of authority to
these men to investigate tariffs
and make report.
However, the tariff has become
such a bugaboo in the public mind,
with so many contrary statements
made regarding its effects here
and there, that it is likely a tariff
board will result. A congression
al fight will result —not as to the
plan itself, but as to the details
of it. Already bills have been in
troduced by a number of congress
men to provide a tariff board.
Senator Poindexter and Congress
man Dill have both introduced
bills to create such a board, per
haps not so much with the idea
that their bills will be enacted, as
to show their ideas on the subject.
The bill will be framed by the
committee on ways and means.
with the assistance of the demo
cratic leaders, and the spring
months may sec the tariff board
question uppermost in congres
sional discussion.

Jacob 11. Behiff, New York
banker, addressed the Republican
Club in New York a few evening!
ago, Mr. Sehifl told his hearer*
some things that probably were
not welcome to their ears, but
which they will profit by ponder
ing. Among other things, he
said: "My heart is with the Re
publican party, but my common
sense makes mo a Democrat."
That certainly was a stiff wallop
for his fellow lovers of a party
which has always proclaimed it
self to be the last word in efficien
cy and sound common sense. If
the trained business judgment of
Banker Sehiff would not permit
him to vote for the party of his
heart's affection, there must have
been a very substantial reason.
Mr. Schiff was constrained to vote
for Mr. Wilson. It was the first
time he ever voted for a Demo
crat for president, but he con
fesses that he isn't sorry he did it.
In fact, he'll do it again.
"Standing here on holy Repub
lican ground." said Mr. Sehiff, " 1
say without fear or favor, if you
renew in the next presidential
campaign the tariff agitation of
the past; if you threaten the coun
try, and show it that you want
a renewal of special privilege and
high protection, the people will
have none of it. The people have
learned, the workmen and farm
ers have learned, and they can
not be misled any further."
Thai is why Mr. Schiff's com
mon sense makes him a Demo
crat though his lifelong political
associations have been Republi
can. The Republicans have been
content to win elections on a "full
dinner pail" platform, and they
succeeded so many times that they
thought the people would never
wake up to the hollowness and
hypocrisy of their pretensions.
They refused to reform the cur
rency, though Mr. Sehiff predict
ed the last panic nearly a year in
advance as a result, of the old
system. They refused to do any
thing useful. They stood pat on
the full dinner pail slogan and
the same old Bourbon leaders that
nearly wrecked the party are still
in control of the machinery and
figuring to jam through another
election on the same ancient,
worm-eaten platform, embellished
with a few flimsy new planks de
signed to make political capital
out of our delicate foreign rela
tions. They ought to thank Mr.
Sehiff for his candor in warning
them. There are a good many
others like Mr. Sehiff whose
hearts are for the Republican
party but whose common sense
makes them Democrats.
In 1900 the death rate from
nephritis and Bright's disease in
the registration area of the United
states was 88 per 100,000 popu
lation. Thirteen years later the
death rate from the same diseases
had increased to 104 per 100,000
population. During this year
there were 00,882 deaths, divided
with respect to age, as follows:
13,544 persons died under 40 years
of age, and 52,338 persons died
over 40 years of age. In other
words, at 40 years of age your
chances of dying from kidney
troubles have materially increased
since the beginning of the pres
ent century.
The state of Washington shown
the same alarming rate of in
crease that is shown throughoul
the registration area. In 1910
the number of deaths in the state
of Washington from nephritis.
Bright'■ disease and diabetes
(this disease is included because
it is detected usually by a urin
ary examination) was 715, and in
1!)14 the number of recorded
deaths fol' these diseases was 897.
The numbers of deaths from
pulmonary tuberculosis Tor 1010
was H'-fi, and in 1914 was 800]
that is, during the year 1914 there
were 7 more deaths from kidney

troubles than from tuberculosis
of the I line's. If the deaths due
to these discuses keep up at the
same rate as the 1!»14 records
show, it means that on an average
of every 13 persons you meet, one
would succumb to this lingering
dentil.
Something should be done and
it good deal could be done to pre
vent some of this loss of life.
Diabetes and Bright's disease kill
the patient by slow torture. Their
onset, is usually so gradual and
insidious that the victim is be
yond help before he is aware of
the terrible calamity that has
some to him.
The causes which are chiefly
responsible for the onset of these
troubles arc errors in diet, bad
habits, lack of exercise, irregular
hours, overwork, loss of sleep,
and impure air.
All of these disease* ••nn be de
tected by urinary examination, as
a rule, before any other distinc
t ive symptoms arise.
in the tight of these facts it
would seem advisable, and even
imperative, that every person over
to years of sige should have a
urinary examination made at
least every yi'nr or two. Possibly
these examinations oould be made
by the health laboratories with
out charge to the individual. —
