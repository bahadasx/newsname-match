Not infrequently the railroads do

down wlien it was sutisfied that Davy
had fully made up his mind to shoot.
Secretary Charles W. Evans of the
Chamber of Commerce received word
from Charleston this morning that
the Public Service commission, in
compliance with the request of the
chamber, had agreed to postpone the
hearing in the case growing out of
the refusal of the railroads to inter
change freight in the Fairmont dis
trict until March 1, and that in all
probability arrangements could be
made to take the evidence and hear
the arguments in the matter at a ses
sion of the commission to be held, in
Fairmont..
| But hard upon the receipt of this in
I formation there was an intimation
j from a source which was not devulged
at the commerce body's offices today
that the railroads would be able to get
together, and that before the new day
'set ?for.-the hearing arrives there will
be no complaint to bring before the
commission.
