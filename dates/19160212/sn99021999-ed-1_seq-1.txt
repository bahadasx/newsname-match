Home War Committee Adopts
Resolution Thanking Wilson
for Not Insisting on
Having Own Way.
NEW NOTE OF CO-OPERATION
Representative Kahn, Ranking Re
publican Member of Body,
Offers Motion.
GARRISON'S GOING CLARIFIES
WASHINGTON, Feb. 11. A new
note of, harmony and co-operation on
national defense problems was struck
in tho house military committee to
day as a direct result of the resigna
tion of Secretary Garrison of the
War department. It round expression
in the adoption of a resolution de
claring the committee's appreciation
of the confidenco President Wilson
reposed in it and In the senate com
mittee as disclosed in his correspond
ence with Mr. Garrison.
The nonpartisan character of the
feeling was emphasized by the fact
that the resolution was offered by
Representative Kahn of California,
ranking republican member of the
committee.
( oufrfit Has Owi May.
Members of both the congressional
committee! declared that the war secre
tary's withdrawal had brought out
sharply the president's desire that con
Kress should work out its army problems
In the lglht of Its own best judgment,
despite his personal preference for the
continental army scheme advocated by
r. Garrison and the army war college.
he net result, they agreed, was a clari
fication of the congressional atmosphere
nd the assurance of support for the
bills that will he drafted from elements
g both the democratic and republican
side that had heretofore been counted
against the measures.
In substance. It In believed the. bills
will represent an effort to make effec
tive virtually all of the plans of the
War department with the exception that
federalization of the National Guard will
be sought as a substitute (or the con
tinental army plan. I
Final steps toward beginning the draft
ing of the measures were' taken today
by both house and senate committees.
Both will take up the work Monday and
It la planned to hold all-day sessions
whenever the business of the two houses
will permit.' The house ' committee
brought to a close today public hearing
on army plans" ' '" 111 '" .
Be ComprosilH,
Present Indications are that the house
bill will lay Its stress upon provisions
designed to federallse the National Guard,
while the senate committee's main effort
will be to go Into tho regular army angles
of preparedness' plans. The final meas
ures sent to the president for his sig
nature will be a compromise. It is
thought, each house being willing to ac
cept the Judgment of - the other to a
large extent In Its own particular field.
The house bill. It Is expected, will pro
vide for payment of National guardsmen

) ono men. the ultimate sue 01 pro
posed continental army. To maae certain
the availability for federal use In time
of war or great emergency of all men
who participate in this payment, the plan
contemplate authorising the president to
draft them Into a volunteer army. .t
Members of the committee are virtually
unanimous In the opinion that congress
has full constitutional authority to enact
such a measure and that it can be so
formulated as to withstand any attack
through the courts.
Of II road Character.
The i-ystem of regulation contemplated
Is of a broad character, designed to pro
vide for the training and discipline of
the guardsmen in peace times In a way
that will Insure efficient organization for
volunteer war service. Only the adminis
tration of the law would be left with the
War department. It Is proposed also to
provide under these regulations for the
co-ordination of enlistment periods, physi
cal standards and the examinations which
officers appointed by state authorities
must pass, for an adequate reserve ss

WILSON'S MESSAGE
TO TRADE BOARDS
Flame of War May Extend to United
States Despite All Efforts to
Preyent It.
PRAISES THE "RESERVE SYSTEM
WASHINGTON. Feb. 11. Dele
gates to the annual convention of
Ihe Chamber of Commerce of the
United States left for their homes
today, carrying with them a message
from President Wilson, the out
standing feature of which was his
determination to keep the United
States out of the European conflict,
although he declared that the nation
merely held that trouble at arm's
length.
The president was speaking on
ntutrality at the annual banquet of
the chamber, which was a conclud
ing feature of a three days' conven
tion. The president also spoke of
the need of a real scientific tariff
board end a merchant marine.
"It Is a cruel thing." said the president,
"to have It supposed, an.lt la In "many
quarters, that we have kept out of this
war simply because we wanted to keep
out of trouble and aimply because we
wanted to profit by the trouble of others,
and yet misunderstandings for the time
being are not to.be reckoned as against
the consciousness that we must ourselves
hold that we hare pursued the right
and only serviceable course. I am not
afraid of the slow verdict of history
;lth regard to the neutrality of the
United States, and I believe that we are
justified in exercising every degree of
patience In making It clear what our
position Is and how sincerely we are
determined not to allow this quarrel to
become part of ours.
War May Spread to America. "
"I have only this to say, though we
hold this trouble at arms length -and
keep or attempt to keep our own Judg
ments cool, but the rest of the world
is hot and It may be that any time with
out our co-operation and without our
ability to stop It the flame may extend
to us.
"And, therefore, I am glad that the
United States has been put Into a posi
tion to mobilise Its financial resources
and to get Into the position which It
must at last get into, whether It wants
to or not. ',
"If only we can keep this great nation
at peace, there Is an Infinite prospect of
happy prosperity - before the United
States."
Favors Heserve System.
The president spoke of the federal re
serve law, saying:
' "When you reflect what might have
happened If our ' banking system had It
t the outset of thia war been the clumsy
and antlquateXVhlng that It waK' three
years ago. you will realise that not only
might we not have escaped disaster, but
that disaster might- have- been o pro
longed that Jt would have ben Impossible
for the United States to occupy the po
sition It now occupies."

SOME NAMES NOT UPON ROLL
LONDON. Feb. 11. A Berlin offi
cial statement received heretoday
claims that a British cruiser, the
Arabia, has been sunk by a German
torpedo boat craft and another Brit
ish cruiser torpedoed. The British of
ficial press bureau denies this.
The British cruiser Arabia is not
listed in the current naval publica
tions. This is explained by the fact
that the names of the new boats of
the British navy have not been given
out by the admiralty because of war
conditions. .
The German statement was to the
effect that the German torpedo
craft met British cruisers oft the
Dogger bank on Thursday night and
sank the new cruiser Arabia and tor
pedoed a second cruiser.
In giving out the German message
for publication the press bureau ap
pended the following:
"The British admiralty states that
the cruisers above mentioned were
four mine-sweeping vessels, three of
which have returned aafetly."

. ' Merchant Vessels
' BERLIN, Feb.' U.-Vla London.WThs
German government's decision to treat
armed merchantmen of hostile countries
as warships has beet received with the
heartiest approval. ' The press of all par
ties expresses the belief that neutrals will
now be compelled to avoid all merchant
men of nations at war with Germany, and
also to treat such vessels when In their
harbors as wsrshlps, granting them. only
the usual right to a limited stay for tak
ing on coal, etc.
Captain I. Perslus says In the Tageblatt
that the copy of the British admiralty
Instructions concerning operations against
submarines will open the eyes of neutrals
In regard to merchantmen armed "for de
fense 'only," and that neutrals will treat
them as warships. The new procedure,
he says, will make the way easier for the
submsrlne, although there Is still the
possibility that Germany's enemies win
fly false colors.
The Kreme Zeltung asserts the memo
randum opens the wsy to a settlement of
the Lusltania case, and also abolishes the
lossibillty of protecting hostile ships by
placing Americana on board. It refers to
the flying of false colors and continues:
"America and other neutrals permit this
deceptive use of their colors. No matter
whether they cannot or, will not atop it,
they must bear the. responsibility. If wo
are to treat all enemy merchantmen
which are armed as r-elllgerents. we can
not stop because a neutral flag Is used
wrongfully.". .. .

The president, his friends said, worked

. Technically, the War department today
was without a head. eJthough Major
General Hugh Scott, chief of staff of
the army, was the ranking officer.
Under an existing executive order Gen

today decided that neither Mr. Garrison
