PLAN TO MOBILIZE
COUPS OF NATION
Josephus Daniels, secretary of the
navy, recently announced plans call
ing for a mobilization of the naval
torces of the country and it is believ
ed they will be approved by congress
A fleet of reserve battleships will be
placed at the disposal of the naval
reserves and naval militia, if his
plan is adopted.
An appropriation of $77,000 will
be asked to cover the traveling ex
penses of the militiamen of the Great
Lakes and other interior sections to
the seacoast to join in the mobiliza
tion.
The old battleships Oregon, Kear
sage and Kentucky are to be turned
over next month to the militia forces
of the Atlantic and Pacific for per
manent practice ships at San Fran
cisco, the Kearsage at Boston and the
Kentucky at New York. These three
ships and the reserve pre-dread
naughts, which carry the Annapolis
midshipmen on their summer cruise,
will make up the fleet, manned 40
per cent by regular officers and men,
and 60 per cent by the reserve and
naval militia.
The department also will turn
over five of the older destroyers to
the naval militia of the South At
lantic, and Gulf coast.
Will Assemble Many Reservists.
In all, the department is asking for
$387,000 for the reserve, and militia
this year, and expects to get together
more than 4,500 reservists of both
classes out for the summer mobiliza
tion There are now 800 men in theHogs
regular reserve and 8,000 approxi
mately in the naval militia.
The details of the plan which in
volves the first peace mobilization
ever attempted by the navy, have not
been made public. Militiamen and
reservists from the interior will go
to the nearest coast point to be pick
ed up by the ships to which they are
assigned.

BESTUL SAYS BOYS

Bemidji Girls to Meet Pine River
Quint Tonight at the
Armory.
Can the Bemidji high school bas
ket ball team defeat the Brainerd
high school quint at Brainerd to

have a stiff game," said Coach Julius
Bestul of the Bemidji quint, at the

left for Brainerd. "The boys are
prepared for a hard battle and we are
going to Brainerd expecting to win."
The following made the trip to
Brainerd today, Tanner and Johnson,
forwards, Cameron, center, Bailey
and Graham guards, and Plummer,
substitute. A number of local sup
porters accompanied the team.
Coach Bestul announced before his
departure this morning that a game
had been secured with the St Cloud
high school quint, to be played here
next Saturday at the Armory. The
down-state team has been playing a
fast game, but it is believed that if
the local boys can defeat Brainerd
tonight that they can put away the
St Cloud quint

BELTRAMI COUNTY TO
GET STATE ROAD FUND
Beltrami county will receive its
apportionment of the state road fund
March 7 when the allotment of the
road and bridge fund will be made
by the state highway commission.
According to the state law every
county must have allotted to it at
least 1 per cent of the fund and the
maximum allotment for any one
county is 3 per cent Since the three
largest counties contribute about 50
per cent of the fund it is usual to
allot nearly the maximum to Ramsey,
Hennepin and St. Louis counties and
some of the others which contribute
much more than 1 per cent, generally
get back what they pay in.
If this custom is followed this year
the commission will not have more
than 4 or at most 5 per cent of the
fund to distribute among the other
counties of the state over and above
the minimum.

WITH SMITH IN BUSINESS
BULLETIN.
St. Paul, Minn., Feb. 12.
Governor Burnquist this after
noon appointed A. Gooding of
Rochester, a banker, to succeed
Walter J. Smith as state treas
urer. Gooding is a Republican.
He was born in Rochester. He
was a messenger boy for the
Union National bank of Roches
ter in 1888 and is now presi
dent of the First National bank
of Rochester. He is an officer in
telephone and milling companies
there. He will begin his term
Monday.

Treasurer Walter Smith today re

jury charging irregularities in the
handling of $28,000 of state funds.
Smith is still at the Gatling insti
tute, Minneapolis. He gave his res
ignation to George Lafond, clerk of
the state treasurer's office, last night.
Lafond gave the resignation to Gov
ernor Burnquist today
To Make Appointment.
Governor Burnquist expects to
make an appointment to fill the va
cancy immediately Those who are
being considered seriously are A. C.
Gooding of Rochester and E. L.
Erickson, deputy state treasurer.
Condition Critical.
Smith is in a critical condition at
the Gatling institute He is too sick
to be brought to the city hospital in
St Paul
Officials from St Paul went to the
institute yesterday to bring Smith to
St Paul but on the advice of a phys
ician he was not moved. Dr. Brodie,
city physician, examined Smith this
morning and stated that he was some
better, but that he would not be able
to be moved.
Wife at Bedside.
Mrs. Smith and daughter are con
stantly at the bedside of the former
state treasurer.
Smith's mind was some clearer this
morning but he is in a nervous con
dition.
"I don't care when I die," he said
to Dr Brodie He promised state
officials that he would not attempt
to escape However, he is being
guarded by St. Paul police officials.
Ramsey county officials want to re
move him to St. Paul on account of
the expense of keeping a deputy in
Minneapolis to guard him.
Induced Speculations, Belief.
A strange explanation of Smith's
alleged act in tampering with state
funds was made today when it was
learned that he has received offers
of credit to an almost unlimited ex
tent from banks in the state desirous
of becoming depositories of state
moneys.
It was suggested that this credit
first induced the speculations in
which he is said by Robert C. Picket
to have participated. Impaired
physical condition and the realiza
tion that his credit was inflated by
his official position are believed to
have led to his indiscretions.
It is now known that, in several
instances, Smith availed himself of
credit for small amounts, notably
with St. Paul, St. Cloud, Stillwater
and Iron Range banks.
In Private Deals.
Smith is interested heavily in at
least two private business enter
prises. Associated with him are
state officials and business men in
nearly every county in the state. One
enterprise is the Section Four Mines
Co., capitalized at $500,000 which
owns iron ore property near Eveleth,
Minn Smith is president of the
company No ore has been shipped
from the mine Among the stock
holders are a number of Bemidji men
and Beltrami county officials.
Smith is also treasurer of the Am
erican Resilient Wheel Co., in which
a number of state officials are inter
ested. This company was organized
to manufacture a patented automo
bile wheel with hard rubber tires in
stead of pneumatic tires. The com
pany's headquarters are in Chicago,'
Was a Banker.
Smith was formerly president of
