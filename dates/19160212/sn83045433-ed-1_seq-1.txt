Gen. ?Scott. Placed in Charge Tempor
arily, Shares Garrison's Views.
Shake-up Likely.
After a day In which rumor ran riot,
opinion In administration circles last
night crystallised Into a firm conviction
that Pi-esldent Wilson's choice ot m
successor to fill the post made vacant
br the resignation of Secretary of War
Garrison Mes between two men. Thees
men are:
?Sen. George W. Goethals. governor of
the Canal Zone.
Franklin D. Roosevelt. Assistant ?ec
retary of the Navy.
Several other names were suggested to
the President by administration Sena
tors who called at the White House dur
ing the day. It was early established
that the President ls strongly opposed
to appointing any man, however wen
fitted otherwise for the post, who has
not had previous experience ln running
a fovernment department
Tha fact ?that the new Secretary of
War will be deprived of the service?
of an experienced assistant ?ecretary
?erres to emphasise the need of depart
mental experience ou the part of the new
comer.
Whether Gen. Goethals will accept the
position ln the event of Its being offered
him la considered open to doubt tn view
ot hia repeated statements that be would
never voluntarily leave "the canal job"
until tt ts tn successful operation.
Assistant Secretary Roosevelt's ?record
In the Navy Department Is urged by his
friends aa the best proof of his ability
to fill Mr. Garrison'? shoes ln the Wsr
Department It may be stated positively
that no appointments would be welcomed
with greater Joy on the part of War
Department officials.
Wsato Experienced Head.
If the President does not confine his
choice to these two men it ls believed
that he may make Inter-cablnet changes
that will result In placing the War D^
Fartai? t In the hands of either Sec
retary of the Interior Lane or Secretary
of Agriculture Houston.
Others whom rumor favored are:
Henry If. Plndell. of Peor?a. 111., nom
inated to be ambassador to Russia, but
who withdrew hi? name in the face of
opposition and supposedly as the result
of a hint from the Russian government
Representative Swagar Sherley, of Ken

Germany Suing for Peace;
Vatican Gets Confirmation
-
Special Cable ?e The ? aaklnatoa Herald.
Lonekm, Feb. II.?The Daily News has received the following from
R. Mackenzie, its correspondent at Rome :
"Besides Prince von Buelow, Prince Hohenlohe and Baron von Kraft
are now in Switzerland striving towards peace which the Kaiser is de
termined to hasten, possibly in order to avert Italy's declaration of war
against Germany, which German papers now hint is imminent.
"The Kaiser's representatives in Switzerland are empowered to in
duce the Berne pacifist committee to assume the initiative in the proposal
for an armistice which would be a prelude to negotiations for peace. As
surances have been received, it is said, that Germany is disposed to make
concessions if they are indispensable for a hastening of peace.
"Furthermore, Austria is on the verge of exhaustion.
"Confidential information has reached the Vatican confirming Ger
many's efforts to seek peace." /

London, Feb. 2.?Lord Montagu, of
Beauleau, upon hi? arrival at Southamp
ton, baily wounded from Injurie? re
ceived when the Persia was sunk ln the
Mediterranean by a torpedo, give? the
following graphic ?tatement:
By LORD MONTAGU.
"T am really returning from the grave.
?'The voyage of the Persia, wa? very
successful until ahe waa torpedoed, and
every one on board waa very comfortable
and happy a? they nearest home. About
? : ; ) a. m. on Thursday, December At, ma
we were sitting down to lunch, there was
a terrtuc explosion Juat allait the main
saloon. It blew out part? of the walls
of the dining aaloon, and th? odor of
acids ln the torpedo at-enoe told me what
had happened.
Shi* Tarns Over.
"The passengers, all of whom had been
previously assigned to certain lifeboat?,
tried to reach their appointed ?tatlona.
When I got to mine, which waa In life
boat N*o. ?, the ?hip was heeling over so
badly that it waa found Impossible to
launch any of the boats on that side. I
climbed up with great difficulty to the
starboard side, trying to pull with me
my secretary. Miss Thornton, who hap
pened to be near.
"Within three minutes after the tor
peo struck the ship wa? on her beam
ends, going down by the ?tern. I wa?
?wept off my feet by a rush of water,
and In a few seconds found myself ln
the ocean and under water. It seemed
that I would never come up. A? the
great ship went down. I wa? sucked
along with it. striking my head and body
several times with great violence either
against part of the ship or wreckage,
1 don't know which.
"I wore a Gleve waistcoat, which has
more buoyancy than an ordinary life
preserver. Thus, while I lost conacioua
ness from blows on the head, received
under water, my waistcoat promptly
brought me to the surface- When I
recovered my senses sufficiently to look
around, I saw the ?ea covered with
struggling human beings, very little
wreckage and no sign ot the Persia,
?mir Three Bosta Left.
"Only three undamaged boats were left
afloat, these were only partly 11.led. I
swam about fifty yards toward a boat
floating upside down. Eventually I man
aged to climb up and get astride of the
keel.
Twenty-six persons wearing life pre
servers of some kind eventually caught
hold of the capsized boat, but several of
these were too weary to hold on. A big
wave occasionally knocked us all off. One
of these righted the boat and nineteen of
us managed to scramble into It. She had
a hole ln her bottom so that ?he barely
floated.
"We stayed In thla boat two days and
two nights and were then picked up by
the steamer Nedg Chow, which brought
us to London.*'

TAFT PLEADS
FOR DEFENSE
Tells Geographic Society the
Country Should Prepare
Fully but Avoid War.
SAYS PEACE IS ESSENTIAL
UNDER DEMOCRATIC REGIME
Form?- President Declares Popular
Government Is Impossible When
War Hounds Are Loose.
A democracy should make every
preparation for national defense, -.but
? h ou M avoid war whrn It can do so
with honor and without national aacri
flce, becauae the principles of de
mocracy?a free press and unre
stricted public opinion?are not the
quickest forms through which to over
power an enemy.
This Is the substance of a state
ment made by former President William
H. Taft in an address before the Na
tional Geographic Society at New Ma
sonic Temple last night. The applause
which greeted the former Preaident
lasted several minutes.
"England's course In this war." aaid
Mr. Taft, "has confirmed the view that
If war is to be a normal condition of
national and International life, popu
lar government with a free press and
unrestricted public opinion is not the
beet form adapted to act quickly to
overwhelm an enemy. Its Inherent
disadvantage In the outset of a war
la not only a reason why a democracy
should avoid war when It can do so
with honor and without national sacri
fice, but it la also a reason why it
should In time of peace make every
preparation for national defense con
sistent with Individual liberty and
the control of the people."

A**ene, Gieece, Feb. 11.?At laat the

just ordinary clubs, for braining mtn.
The Austro-Gem?an soldiers ar? sup
plied with bludgeons and on parts of
the British front the ally soldiers have
been furnished clubs covered with
spikes.
These British clubs look much like
the big stick American cartoonists
used to picture T. R. as using. The
clubs are for use by troops entering
trenches on the sly and slaying noise
lessly so that men in other parta of
the same line will not know what is
i going on.
One of the newest missiles in the
great war is a huge shell the Germans
j threw at the Dardanelles. Only air
? guns could throw the shell without
exploding it, and these new air guns
must be 10 inches in bore and many
feet long. One of these big shells
which fell in the British line unex
ploded has been taken apart by ex
perts. It was 10 inches in diameter
and IS inches high, made of sheet steel
with wooden plug-disk s at each end.
This big steel can contained seventy
six pieces of scrap iron and twenty
five pounds of trl-nitro-toluol. The
missile weighs fifty-one pounds. The
firing of the big shell must have been
touchy work.
Imagine a fire cracker 10 inches
thick that would blow a hole in the
earth 6 feet deep and 10 feet in diam
eter. Imagine yourself facing the duty
of lighting the fuse of this fifty-one
pound cracker and then, while the fuse
was sputtering, placing the cracker
in the mouth of a giant air gun and
firing the gun in time to get the
cracker out of your neighborhood be
fore it went off.
