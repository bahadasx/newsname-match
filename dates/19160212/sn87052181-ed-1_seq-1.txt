CO-EDS NEED A GYM
Women at Missouri University
Have Started a Campaign
for New Building,
WILL SHOW THE LEGISLATORS
General Assembly Hall for the Women
at Columbia Has Been Need
ed for Years.
Missouri university women havo
started a campaign to show Missouri
legislators the need of a woman's gym
nasium and general .building at Colum
bia. For yoars there has been need
of such a place for Y. W. C. A. meet
IngSj for rest rooms and tho like. At
tho la3t session of tho state legisla
ture a bill for such a building was
presented, but tho appropriation was
not passed.
Several years ago the institution set
aside a tract of land for women's 'ten
nis courts and hockey grounds, but
tho best gymnasium they could build
was a little 10 by 12 wooden structure
that would hardly accoramodato a doz
en girls comfortably.
Miss Gladys Udell, president of tho
Women's Sclf-Government Association,
and of tho Women's Council, Is In
chargo of tho campaign for a general
assembly hall building for Missouri
co-eds.
"The only building that at present
can bo called a women's building,"
said Miss Udrll several days ago, "is
the little shed on tho hockey field.
If those who make appropriations for
Missouri university could see tho ac
commodations provided for' S80 wom
en students, they might perhaps, be
more generous with us."
Miss Eva Johnston, adviser of wom

tho Missouri Alumni club In St. Louis

make other talks Inter through the

campaign for tho new building.

MAY LOSE THEIR SAVINGS
Mutual Policy Holders Revolt Against
Merger with Old Line Company
nt Higher Rates.
Kearney, In Clay county, Is In a
forment of excitement over the trans
fer of tho Clay Life Association to Do
catur, 111.
Tho Clay Life Association was or
ganized In Kearnoy twenty-four years
ago on a mutual plan, and its rates
were very low. It had 5,321 policy
holders In Western Missouri, tho ma
jority of them In Clay and Ray coun
ties, and In St. Joseph and Springfield.
Many of these had been paying prem
iums for twenty-four years. Now the
company has bqen merged with an
old-line life Insurance compapy in De
catur, III., nnd those of tho old com
pany who wish to pay old-lino insur
ance rates may get now policies in the
Illinois company for their old policies
in the Clay Life Association. Other
wise they must drop out and loao all
they over paid in.
Tills works a hardship upon old men
and women policy holders In the com
pany because tho rato they will have
to pay for new policies will bo so high
as to bo almost prohibitive. Of tho
policy holders In tho Clay Llfo Asso
ciation 1,800 are upwards of fifty
years old, nnd many are sixty and
soventy.
The Clay Llfo Association had
$5,521,000 written Insurance. Tho Illi
nois company which absorbed it had
thirty thousand policy holders, 30 mil
lion dollars Insurance in forco and
million dollars nssets.
The policy holdern in Clay county
are organizing now to see If some
proceeding cannot bo brought to set

For many decades thero has been In

who have been plotting to overthrow
tho present form of absolute govern

every known moans of thwarting tho

Tho secret pollco that term in tho

us back to boyhood days when wo

Invention nccrots, during tho last 15
(months or so, and that tho plans of
many of our lmportnnt fortifications
havo been cppled or stolen.
The president Iuiowb this; so dp tho
members of his cabinet, tbo naval
and military leaders, tho secret serv
ice, and some members of congress.
And with this knowled'go has como a
realization that if tho United States
Is to havo a woll rounded defensive
forco on land and sea it must also
havo a good secret service that can
keop tab on tho foreign spios In this
country nnd can got Information for
us In foreign countries.
Novor has thero been such an em
phatic need for a large, highly trained
and efficient secret service such as
other countries have to cope with ex
actly such conditions.
That tho administration has nt last
awakened to tho need is shown by
tho announcement that n plan is now
on foot to combine all the Investigat
ing bureaus of tho country under ono
general head with sufficient subheads
of suboxocutlves to Insure efficiency
and economy and at tho samo time en
able tho country to combat such con
ditions as now exist.
Tho nucleus nround which the now.
organization will be built, it Is
naturally assumed, Is tho secret serv
ico which for Just 50 years has dono
tho greater part of the work of con
ducting confidential Investigations for
the federal government, has unearthed
counterfeiters, has guarded the presi
dent nnd all foreign visitors of noto,
and has carried on the most difficult,
delicate and Important inquiries for
tho stnto department.
Into this now bureau or perhaps It
will bo mado a distinct department of
tho government with a cabinet offl.
cer at Its head will be gathered, It
Is proposed, tho coast guard service,
the fleet of revenue cutters, tho cus
toms Inspectors, tho inspectors of land
frauds, tho immigration inspectors, tho
post offico inspectors, tho spoctal In
vestigators of tho department of Jus
tice and tho bank examiners.
But of nil those special Investigators
tho members of the secret servlco un
der Chief William J. Flynn are by far
tho mo3t highly trained and tho best
equipped by tradition and long years
of experience In handling tho roost
dangerous, tho roost Intellectual and
the most astute criminals, nnd are
thoroforo best fitted to undertako the
broader tasks now set before tho na
tion, In other words, the socret serv
ice already has been handling In a
small way under restrictions Imposed
b law and by limited funds tho tasks
that will bo undertaken In tho future
in a moro comprehensive and effective
manner.
Comparatively llttlo of 'tho real work
of tho socret servlco Is known to tho
public. Tho effectiveness of the or
ganization lias lain partly In. that fact.
Still fowcr perhaps know the' chan
nels for getting Information which tho
sorvlco nnd Flynn havo devolopod by
long years of careful study and fore
sight and hard work. It may bo sato
ly guessed that tho facts that .they
hnvo dug up In tho last year are
known to vory fow men In tho. United
States. Not oven tho socret servlco
men themselves havo at times, real

togcthor Into ons big mosaic picture,
revealing somo vast undertaking and
supplying Information of great impor
tance to tho administration.
It 13 by many such investigations
conducted In this country and perhaps
abroad that tho administration bos
gathered information that has enabled
tho federal officials to foresee Inter
national events before thoy really hap
pened and to preparo for contingen
cies with propor care. Much of tho
important work which tho secret serv
lco has done has been performed un
der tho direction of tho stato depart
ment, which has n confidential fund
for such investigations, and which,
calls upon tho secret sorvlco chief to
supply tho men for tho work.
While tho public hoars llttlo of tho
details of tho work of the secret serv
ice, tho chief has agents all ovor tho
country and all over tho world, men of
great skill, many of them of high edu
cation, others of llttlo school educa
tion but graduates In tho university of
human nature and of criminology, men
of great courage and necessarily of
tremendous resourcefulness. They
may be hero today and In tho far
East a month henco. They may bo. In
Now York this morning and may start
for Europo tomorrow on somo mis
sion. An Investigation in China may re
quire the presence thero of several
men. Thero may bo n counterfeiting
plot that has a clue leading to Mexico.
Thero may bo a conspiracy to start a
revolution In Mexico that has trails
leading to Barcelona, Spain; to Paris.
London nnd to Moxlco City. In overy
direction that may be necessary men
nro dispatched to n.ako investigations
and to report to tho home office. Many
a revolutionary plot hatched in foreign
countries has beon frustrated because
a cluo was obtained here and the plot
tors traced and exposed.
Tho limitations under which this
work has been carried on is shown by
tho laws under which the service is
authorized and tho money fs appro
priated. Tho appointment of tho chief
of tho socret sorvlco, his assistant and
a fow clerks lo authorized by ono law.
Tho Bundry civil hill appropriates
monoy for tho hiring of agents at so
much a day, but at tho samo tlmo
makes it Impossible tor thoso men to
be assigned to work in any other de
partment, thereby making restrictions
that prevent the chief from gottlng the
best work from them.
For Instance, It tho chief has a man
who has proved himself specially capa
ble In a cortaln lino of work and If
just such a man Is needed In a cer
tain department of tho government tho
chief cannot dctnll him for the task
because the law specially provides that
no man hired by tho chief or tho secret
sorvlco for work In tho treasury de
partment can be assigned within tho
