CHALMERS CARS ARE RIVETED SECURELY TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF TOMORROW
Chalmers builds—I sell—you buy, not merely lor today,
but for tomorrow.
When 1 sell you a Chalmers car, I am looking into the
many tomorrows that stretch ahead.
The struggle of motor engineering does not end with the
production of speed, power, safety, comfort, beauty.
It is a buttie with time itself.
Just how many years the Six-30 3400r.p.m. Chalmers I am
selling today for *$10.50 will stand up and obey your bidding,
I don't know, Hugh Chalmers doesn't know. Nobody knows.
Time has not yet set an age limit upon this magnificent
power beast.
The first Chalmers 30 was born back in 1009—seven
years ago. And "Old Reliable," the first Chalmers 30 built,
is still rolling up the mileage alter over 300,000 miles of
hardest road service.
The new Lix-30 Chalmers with 3400 r. p. m. engine is a
direct descendant of "Old Reliable."
Rut it is a greater and better ear than its forefather.
Into it lias been bred and built a compact summary of motor
eugenics.
This ear delivers 4.5 II. 1*. at the former cost of 20 to 2.5
H. P. It gets twice the mileage per gallon of gasoline that
many of its contemporaries get.
Here is high-speed, high power, high mileage, along with
amazing fuel-thrift.
Engineering hiis taken a new, sharp turn. And Chalmers
leads in wringing high speed and power from an engine with
out sacrifice of operating economy.
The grciit 3400 r. p. m. engine is an insurance policy
against the rising trend of gasoline prices.
Its engine strength is reflected in its c w strength—it
meets the shocks cd hardest usage without, fad?ring or com
plaint. Every gram of material is selected the raw with
always an eye to its lasting qualities. An s.-my of 220 in
spectors watches over every detail of const ruction.
Chalmers cars are riveted to the future with ali the skill
known to science.
Like Tiffany, like Steinvvay. T! .At Chahn'Ts in« lashed
his product securely to the requireincnis of tomorrow.
