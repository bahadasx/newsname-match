If the Brewery Wprkers Want to Win
They Should Hold Executive Meetings, Otherwise It Is Impossible
They Are Being Double-Crossed by the Well Oiled Machine Built
Up to Fight Prohibition, But Now Being
the Brewers.
The situation of the brewery workers'
demand for more pay and better condi
tions has not changed to any extent this
weekv The brewery workers still de
mand that they receive an increase of
from $2 to $3 per week and that they be
given at least eight months employment
throughout the year.
The guarantee of eight mouths' em
ployment seems to be the thing most de
sired by tile brewery workers, for it will
surprise the public to know that not one
of these men have put in full time for
the past two years. Men who drive the
keg wagons only get two or three days'
work a week, and at $2.50 a day, only
amounts to $5 or $7.50 a week ; added
to this the continual expense of being
compelled to contribute to the various
funds to fight prohibition.
It is a wonder that the brewers do not
try to find some way to put this advance
in wages upon the shoulders of the poor
saloon-keepers the same as they did the
war tax. When you come to think of it
that the saloon-keeper is compelled to
give up part of his profits for the ma
chine on Eighth street, to fight prohibi
tion, and he never knows what is done
with the money nor how much the brew
ers put in for the same cause, if any
thing. The brewery workers ought to exclude
everybody from their meeting, except
members from their local who are di
rectly interested. They should pay no
attention to labor leaders, lawyers, edi
tors, politicians, or such friends as they
know who were paid by the brewers
during the past two campaigns. They
are all a part of the great, big machine
under the direction of Win. F. I less, and
is now being handled in the interest of
the brewers and against the brewery
workers. The meetings of the brewery
workers is hardly over before a report
is telephoned up to Hess, and he knows
everything that has transpired, lie
knows which members of the union are
for compromising and which members
are for enforcement of the demands,
lie has an ace in the hole and an answer
for your committee before they ever
reach his office.
Pay no attention to politicians and la
bor leaders whom you meet in the saloon
and tell you that "you must not fall out
with the breweries, for if you do the
State will go dry." Remember, he is be
ing paid; he is a part of that machine
and is working night and day against
your interest.
.Meetings of the brewery workers
should be executive and every man who
is not a member of that organization
should not be allowed to be present or
know what is transpired, and if the
brewery workers don't do this they will
not get the demands which the public
believe they are entitled to.
UNION ORGANIZER
CITED TO COURT
I'nliee Claim lie and Another .Man
Were "I'lekets."
James McEntec, national organizer of
the Machinists' Union, and Leonard A.
Thorborn, -ill, of 2S50 Colerain avenue,
were cited to court Saturday by Ser
geant Pllug and Patrolman McNally on
the charge of loitering on the sidewalk.
The men were in front of the J. II. Day
Company's place at 1144 Harrison avenue
and were asked by the officers to move
on. Sergeant Pllug said that they moved
away to the house line of the company
and took their stand there. Sergeant
Pllug says he asked them to keep on
moving, but they refused. He says he
waited a reasonable time and when they
again refused he told them they were
under arrest. They were taken to the
Fifth District station, registered and re
leased on their own recognizance. Both
were doing picket duty, it is alleged.
Safety First
To the Brewery Worker.
Put all outsiders out of your meetings.
Spies tell everything you do.
Do not talk to anyone whom you know was in the employ
of the Personal Liberty League during the past two
campaigns.
Pay no attention to the fellow who tells you "That if you
press your demands the State will go dry."
You workers marched and voted for the bosses, now let us
see what they will do for you!!!
Remember they are all a part of a well-paid machine.
Remember that Hon. William F. Hess is still on the job.
Make them play the game on the level.
Put your trust in God, only.
Arid win your contentions.

The May -Stern Company
Uses Scab Labor
After Promising the Business Agent of the Building
Trades Council to Use Union Labor. Action of the
Executive Committee of the Ohio Federation of Labor
to Be Protested by the Council.
The regular meeting of the Building
Trades Council was called to order last
Thursday evening with President Cullen
in the chair.
The minutes of the previous meeting
were read and adopted.
A communication was received from
the Columbus Trades Council, inquiring
if D. W. McGrath of that city, who has
a contract on the Hamilton County
Court House, is using union labor; the
matter was referred to the Hoard of
Business Agents.
The Board of Trustees reported that
they considered the action of the Execu
tive Hoard of the Ohio Federation of
Labor in expelling the Building Tra'des
Council as absolutely unfair, as the
Council has been a member long before
some of the present members of the ex
ecutive board. It was moved and sec
onded that the matter be taken up with
Mr. Frank Morrison, secretary of the
American hederation of Labor, and the
protest of the Council will be filed with
him at the same time.

"BOYCOTT" SIGNS ARE
BARRED BY INJUNCTION
Judge Issues a Permanent Order
Against Butcher Union.
Court Holds It Is Not Kiglit to Make
"Innocent .Stiller."
".Methods Are Thoroughly Un-Ainer-rim,"
Say Xipjiert.
The carrying of so-called "boycott"
signs allegedly by members of the
Butchers' Local Union, No. 232, in front
of the butcher shops of Robert Jacob
on State avenue and of Emil Helfes
rieder in the Findlay market was per
manently enjoined by Common Pleas
Court judge Nippert in a decision
Wednesday. This is the case in which
Judge Nippert a few months ago is
sued a sweeping injunction "against
the world."
The suit resulting in the injunc
tion was brought by the II. H. Meyer
Packing Company, which complained
that the butchers' union, because of dif
ferences with the packing company, was
annoying butchers who are customers of t
the packing company. j
"It is not a question of whether a I
group of individuals have the right to
form a labor organization for the pro
tection of the interests of the labor
ing classes," Judge Nippert declared.
"It is merely a question whether or not
the defendants shall be permitted to
destroy the established business of a
small shopkeeper in order thereby to
gain its contention. In other words,
shall the innocent and industrious
union butchers, Jacob and Helfesrieder.
and oilier small retail shopkeepers and
tradesmen be crushed in order that there
by the H. II. Meyer Packing Company
will be forced to receive the representa
tives of Butchers' Union Local No. 232
and Michael Schuld in a conference
which the packing company does not de
sire? The method employed is thor
oughly un-American and contrary to the
spirit of our constitution and bill of
rights."
Nicholas Klein was attorney for the
butchers' union and Slutes & McDiar
mid for the Meyers Packing Company.

New York. Emphatic denial was
made today at the office of the railroads
involved iti the threatened strike of 350,
000 trainmen that both sides had reached
an understanding and would shortly
sign new contracts. There has been no
communication on the subject between
the railroads and the trainmen at any

Council announced that the only two
glass houses who have signed with the
union are the Win. J. Glcnny Glass Com
pany and the Cincinnati Glass Company,
The Pittsburgh Glass Company and
Herman Nauer agreed to sign, but have
so far failed to do it.
Under the head of the good and wel
fare, it is reported to the Council that
The May-Stem Co.. house furnishing
dealers, at Fifth and Elm streets, have
had considerable work done by non
union electricians, notwithstanding the
fact that Mr. Newton had promised the
business agent of the Building Trades
Council that he would remove the scabs
and use organized labor: he utterly fail
ed to do so, and it was requested that
the members so inform their local
unions.
The report of Business Agent Hock,
for the week ending February 10th, was
read and adopted.
All trades reported business good.
There being no further business, the
meeting adjourned until next Thursday
night.
COMMITTEE OF THE
CENTRAL LABOR COUNCIL
Complain of Arrests of IMckets
I'lit'htii (Jives His Opinion
of Htilk.'s. . ,-K ,..,
A delegation from Central Labor
Council complained to Mayor Puchta
Wednesday that the striking union ma
chinists are being interfered with by
the police in doing picket duty as per
mitted by law. Of fortv union men thus
far arrested in connection with strikes,
onlv two have been convicted, he was
told.
Mayor Puchta urged the delegation
representing the Central Labor Council
and the Cincinnati machinists' union, to
use every effort to stop strikes in the
city. "Do you realize what these strikes
mean to Cincinnati?" the mayor asked.
"They mean the loss of thousands of
dollars which can never be brought
back." The labor leaders told the mayor
that they were willing to arbitrate, but
that the employers refused to do so.
Mr. Puchta promised to investigate pick
et complaints.
UNION SCORES
WORK BUREAU
At request of the machinists' union,
the Central Labor Council Grievance
Committee communicated with the State
Industrial Commission and the Attorney
General Wednesday on complaints
against the State-City Employment Bu
reau. The machinists charge the bureau in
two cases secured positions in shops
where strikes are on for nonunion men.
They charge this is a violation of laws
governing" the bureau.
The grievance committee will, upon
organization, investigate a charge that
the police interfered with striking ma
chinists on picket duty.
Also that students from the Cincinnati
University and public schools are per
mitted to work in shops where strikes
are on, in pursuance of their manual
training.
The machinists say the strike will
spread to thirty other shops unless an
eight-hour day is granted by May 1.
