Failure to Make Out "First
Degree Murder"
FATE IN JURY'S HANDS
Ex-Police Chauffeur Accused
of Death of Daughter,
Heaves Long Sigh
On (rial since Wednesday for the;
murder of his daughter, Margaret IS.,
ex-Police Chauffeur William Harvey
Shuman this morning stepped from
the shadow of the electric chair.
At 11.80 o'clock District Attorney;
-Michael K. Stroup formally announced
that the State's testimony did not war- '
rant the finding of a verdict of murder
in the first degree.
Second degree or manslaughter, he (
added, was all the Commonwealth
could expect.
President Judge George Kunkel
agreed and instructed the jury ac
cordingly.
Slmmaii 'Heaves a I/Oiig Sigh
Shuman, who eagerly watched the j
court and attorneys during the district j
attorney's admission, heaved a long]
sigh as a the trial judge made his de
cision. Mrs. Shuman raised her veil 1
and dabbed her eyes with her black
bordered handkerchief.
After submitting some "points of j
law" upon which the defense hopes to
obtain acquittal, Philip S. Moyer, of
counsel for the defense, began the
summing up address lo the Jury.
District Attorney Stroup followed ,
with the closing address for the Com
monwealth, after which President
Judge Kunkel delivered the final
charge. Around the Courthouse it
was considered unlikely that a verdict
would be returned until late this even
ing.

When Lincoln fell it was with arms outstretched
To form a cross of human flesh and blood.
And as he lay, those great and tender hands
Seemed reaching out across a war's red flood.
Right to the north, left to the south they lay
As if to beckon to the sons of men
To meet above his dying form and say
Their land should know no severance again.
When Lincoln fell it was a sacrifice
Like unto that upon old Calvary's hill.
Although his flaming soul immortal lives
The shadow of that cross is on us still
Since Lincoln fell!

Marching on Durazzo; Rus

Datest reports from the western
; battle front indicate successes for the
| French in winning back some of the
' positions they lost in the recent
i nibbling of the Germans at their
lines in the Artois and south of the
! Somme. From South llussia and
I Galicia come announcement* that the
| Russian offensive there is assuming
I considerable proportions but without
' striking results having been so far
! achieved. Otherwise comparative
1 calm prevails in the widespread war
! area.
In preparations for eventualities
| around Saloniki. the allies are
! strengthening their positions and ex-
I tending their lines. The French have
advanced across the Vardar north
! west of the city, encamping on the
i right bank of the river.
In Albania the Austrians arc re
ported marching on Durazzo with a
I force not larger than 30,000 men,
! much of the Austrian army having
i been left in the regions already tra-
I versed for Guard purposes. Accord-
I ing to word from Durazzo the dis
arming of the Montenegrins lias not
j been completed, and some of the
| Montenegrin forces are still offering
stiff resistance.
Apparently the Russians are pre
paring to push still further their ag
gressive operations along the Bessara
bian front where they have been men
acing the Austrian lines in Bukowina.
Important troop movements in Bess
arabia are indicated by Bucharest ad
vices.
A Royal decree has been issued in
Rome prohibiting the importation of
German and Austrian goods, theiii*
I transportation through Italy or their
export from .Italian ports. Italy,
j which has never declared war on Ger
many, thus formally records the pro
