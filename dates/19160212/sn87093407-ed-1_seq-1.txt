POLICE SEEK BANQUET POISONER
Waiter Tries to Kill Archbishop, Governor of Illinois and 100 Other Guests
SIX DAYS A WEEK we go about our business, fighting a good clean fight, like men. And on Sunday? On
Sunday we are tired. We would lie abed we would read - the papers, breakfast near noon and slide
ilipshod thru the day, which it a mighty poor way to spend Sunday. Usually, we've found, at the end of such a day we have a headache and a grouch. Taking it all
ground, we'd rather go to church. It's more wholesome. And, hang it, we always feel better for it, at that, after putting in the right sort of a Sunday. So, tomorrow,
let's go! Ministers have asked us all -especially on this Sunday, which they have designated as Go-to-Church Sunday. Let's go! What do you say?

UNION PACIFIC railroad officials have announced Saturday their
intention to spend $60,000 this year advertising thruout the East
the attractions for the tourist In the Northwest.

Messrs. Scott and Hlnshaw, general passenger agent and general
freight agent, respectively, declare they anticipate a great rush of tour
ists to this locality as a result.
Harl Harl
As a matter of fact, they donlt expect anything of the kind.
AND IF $60,000 ACTUALLY ;S SPENT IN THAT MANNER, IT
WILL BE ONE OF THE NUTTIEST THINGS THE UNION PACIFIC
EVER DID.
If they do It, tal»« Messrs. Scott and Hlnshaw to the bug house.
Why, Mr. Business Man, have they made this announcement?
BECAUSE YOU AND YOUR FELLOW BUSINESS MEN HAVE
AWAKENED TO THE FACT THAT THE UNION PACIFIC SYSTEM
HAS BEEN DISCRIMINATING AGAINST YOU AND YOUR BUSI
NESS FOR YEARS AND ARE FIGHTING BACK. THAT'S WHY.
But at the same time, they are perfectly aware that no great rush
of tourists is coming here.
As long as the Union Pacific system holds out to the tourist a
round trip ticket from Chicago to San Francisco and return, via South
ern lines, for $17.50 less than he can buy a ticket to make the trip via
