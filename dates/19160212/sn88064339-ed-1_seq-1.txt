THE HOG LAW AND
THE COST OF FENCES
tfly G. E. NePss, Supt. lave Stoek
Extension iervice. L. S. t.)
The coast atof fencing against hoes
running at large is attracting con
"iderable attention from farm owters.
Very few men who own their farms
have less than 40 acres. and when such
farm lies in the form of a sixteenth
section one-fourth of a mile square, it
will require one mile of tence to en
ltose it. A good hog fence that will
also turn cattle and horses, usually
conists of posts set at Intervals of
about one rod i1l4ft.) with 24. to 60.
inch hog wire at the bottom and one to
Ihree strands of barbed wire at the top.
The coot will vary with the quality of
materials used, but assuming that the
posts are cut on the farm, hauled, set
and the wie wire stretched by farm labor,
at a cost of 10 cents per post, the cost I
of,the fence would be about as follows:
380 posts at 10 cents each, In
. elud erection...........$ 3.00
12o rods of hog wire at 0ec rod. 6,00 L
2 miles (2 strands) barbed wire
at $15 per mile....... . 4 00
("net of hog.proof fence per mile. $16.00
The cost will vary from about $140
to $165 per mile, and will probably
average about $150 for a good tenre.
s fi the barbed wire be omitted at the i
top and wide-woven wire tight enough a
to keep out hogs and high enough to ie
turn rattle and horses be used, it will a
cent from $200 to $275 per mile.)
Where hogs do not run at large and 01
it is only necessary to fence against b
horses and cattle, a four.wire tenee a
will serve every purpose, and would be
. cost about as follows: ci
Â¶20 posts at 10 cents eah, In. a1

at $18 per mile......... 4 .00 t
Cost of four wire horse and - mI
cattle fence...............80. e w
8aving over hog-proof fence -.- -. a
per mile ..,........ $..... . 3 W
As the cost for posts and lab to
would be less for the erection of a four. in
wire than foe the hog proof type, $N56 s
per mile would be a fair average east.
urom these calculations it can be C'(
readily seen that the necessity for 8&
fencing against hogs doubles the cost Ia
of farm fence. This oast alils heaviest ml
on the small farmer and decreases as on
the sise of the farm Increases, At the all
above rates it would cost about $a.1$l of
per acre for a 40acre farm, and 6e ea
tier arre for a square section of 140 of
arens enclosed in a hog-proof fence. bli
The four-wire fenew would cost $2 per
acre for the 40-acre farm and 60 rents
for the 340-acre farm.
These facts Indicate that the ques
tion of a law prohibiting hogs from
running at largep i no longer a politital an
question, but one of farm economy, and fat
affects the small farmer much more an
than it does the lae plantalton owner. sul
In order to fad the comparative cost oie
to farmre for fentaing asainaest hogs bt
running at large. go to the tax records.
find out the number and the value of tee
the hogs In the parish, estimate the 1
nutmber of miles of fend6e required to the
keep them out of the farms. multiply slo
'his by $72.00 and it may be found that be
the excess cost of the fenes Is greater ea
than the value of the hop. If seuh istr,
the asse, the farm owners cotld better the
afford to buy up the hogs and destroy if
them than to keep on paying omat money hii
to fen'ce against them.
The farmer of to-day is devoting an
mtnore attention to the economle side o fwh
his business than ever before, and like fro
the manufacturer, he s scannil the are
"cost sheet" to soe where excessive id
costs and useless expenditures oeeur he
so that he may eliminate them, Jusat for
now hundreds of them are discovering Ias
that the cost to farm owners for tue

in the vihinity of their farms is a very the
exorbitant tas to eontinue a custom of 7
the frontier days when "mast fed" o

but as there is little for them to eat trt
along the roads and lanes between not

worse, nl many ease it leads to bad is (

through the teases, and mesnite!nsu m
hey are killed by the Irate owner of
the field, who thinks his neighbors
should keep their bogs up when they
learn to break through fences.
Another serious aspect of the failure
to confune hogs to the owner's premises
is that they are the most common
source for the spread of hbo cholera,
the suppression of thich Is a farmer's
p. problem. and can not be solved until
s" hjgs are prevented from running at

The only profitable way to rati hop
under the present conditions is to keep

'tlI them abundant grasing on planted
crops and feed them the required
amount of concentrated grains to as.
cure rapid growth. The expense of
to ereting the necessary hog-proof fences
around lots and pastures for keeping
of them in confinement will desrease as
the number of hogs kept increases,
yet But it there were no other objections
except the eost of tfaeing algainst hogs,
st that alone would inspire the farmers
of every parish that has amade any
reasonable progress in farm develop
ment to secure the passage of a hog f

I EXPERIENCE VS. READING.
(The Country Gentleman.)
The doctor resas res medical journal
and learns from it. He boasts of the
Iact that he keeps up in his reading, J
I and if he is not acquainted with some
subject recently written up he apolo
lates for the fact that he has been too
btsy to read lately.
Parming is quite as complex a buet
ses asr practleltn medicine.
The lawyer is ashamed to confes
that he fails to read the latest daci
slong. The beat compliment that can
be paid to a lawyer is that he is well
--ad. So with the teacher, the preach
sr. the enaieer. All of them ooafese
their dependence upon the literature
f their profession to supplemeat the
hinge they leanl from expertiene.
It is only among farmers that we inad
any large nusmber of suessaful men
who declare that they learn altoether
fromt exlperience. Among faruners there
Pre still to be found numerous tadi
tduals who swem ashamed to confess
heir indebtedness to the farm pres
for helpful articles. Yet these men are
enallged in a business that has a litera
ture as extensive and important as the
literature of the lawyer, the enineer,
the minister or the teacher,
This aloof attitude of the farmers is
I confession of weakness. One of the
best cattle feeders in the country
stated, after he had won prises in the
International, that he had never been
in another man's feed yard but had
learned all he knew about feeding from
papers and books and through expert
nce., This is the real expert's spirit.
Most farmers who deny that they get
breefit from readlng are not quite
tellang the truth. They talkabonlt lis
umes, anitrogen, humus and balanced
rtions- -things of which they would
not have been able to speak twenty
vers ago, and of whleh they' could not
have learned, exept throuogh books
tnd papers.

is only half as good a farmer as he
