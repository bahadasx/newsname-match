South And Preparedness.
R :publicad newspapers are
telling the President not to a
trouble himself about the t
west so far as his prepared
ness program is concerned. 8
They advise him to convert I
the South.
The South is not any more b
in need 'of conversion than n
the West, however, and if the
President comes this way as g
he is said to be planning to
do, he will find that. in spite 2
of the attitude of some of t
the Southern representatives 3
happily few, the masses ofl
the peoplein, this section are
as strongly for national de
tenseas those of any other
section of the country. S
The campaign which Judge
Venable won in Mississippi C
is reflective of Southern senti
ment. Senator Vardaman's f
large personal following in (
the State is notdisputed; but i
it was significant that of four
. or five candidates in the race
all but the Vardaman candi
date stood for the broad po
licy advocated by the Presi- I
dent.
Time was when the South
was regarded as- more 4
emotional than practical.
But conditions have changed.
Now it is the section of sound
conservatism. Its conser
vfatisam, however, inv o s no
tlack of patriotism, anrny
want of appilciation of the
dangers of unpreparedness at
a time when the world is on
fire and sparks are faling all
arouand.
SWhen the showdown comes
Ithe South's representatives
will be found standing behind
the head of the government.

OF LITTLE IMPORTANCE
We take pleasure in reproduc
ing the following editorial ap
pearing in the New Orleans Dai
ly States in its valuable edition of
Tuesday, February 8th.,inst.:-
After Col. Pleasant called the
attention of the public to the fact
that one of the editors of the Item
-J. M. Thomson-was awaiting
trial in the criminal courts on a
charge of false swearing to ob
tain a registration paper, and
said the other-Marshall Ballard
-was a "dope fiend"-no one
ever expected our enraged after
noon contemporary to support
Col. Pleasant for Governor, even
if he were the unanimous choice
of the Democracy of the State.
The Item's announcement of
Tuesday that it is for Jbhn M.
Parker, the Republican Progres
sive candidate, is, therefore nei
ther surprising nor important;
and, since it is animated on the
one hand by a desire for personal
revenge and on the other by a
narrow and all-consuming news
paper jealousy, no one is apt to
pay much attention to its braying
during the next two months.
What however, we do object
t) is The Item's impudent pre
tense that Mr. John M. Parker is
a Democrat and it is a Democrat
ic newspaper. Even if Mr. Par
Rer's treachery to Gov. Hall four
years ago to follow Booker Wash
ington's dinner host, did not put
him beyond the Democratic pale,
his vote for Mr. Taft four years
before and his defiant declaration
at the beinning of this campaign
.that he was a progressive and a
Protectionist certainly do so.
As to the Item itself, to call ii
Democratic, straight or hyphen
ated, is to profane a noble word.
It is only to be described as polit
ical bushwhacker.
Mr. Parker and the Item have
now pooled their interest to make
an issue of the so-called bosses,
each with a grievance against
the National Committeeman,
who holds no office but of honor
and. seeks none, who pecuniarily
has not a farthing's interest in
politics, and whose only concern
in the present campaign is the
- tiumph of the Democratic party
over mongrel movement which
Mr. Parker and The Item: repre
sent.
In the Irinary campaign, The
Item and Mr. Parker gave con
stant aid and encouragement to'
Mr. Barret, not because they be
lieved in prohibition; butbecause
from every stump he arraigned
CG. Pleassat as the tool of the
bosses, abused the National Com- i
mitteeman and represented the
Scity organization as seeking to
,spread its tentacles until agaip
they eached round the capitnl
at Baton Rouge.
There can be no mistaklngjete
answer of the country people to
the issue raised by Mr. Barret
and se vehemently argued by
Mr. Barrst, Mr. Parker 'au&The
Item. They repudiated it it
thunder a s tones-every parish
f but one-and they declared Col.
Pleasant their eboice by a crush
tag majority.
Mr. Parke, now becomesa p

revamping the bosses issue, to
make considerable noise during
the pending campaign.
But when 115,000 voters, four
fifths of the electorate, went to
the polls in January, they deter
mined not only the Democratic
nomination, but the result of the
primary as well.
Mr. Parker, by dropping his
Republican protection plank
from his platform the other day,
and The Item, by pretending it is
still Democratic, acknowledge
that neither a Repubiican nor a
Progressive party can win in
Loubsiana.
Neither can a hybrid which is
attempting to parade under De
mocratic colors.
