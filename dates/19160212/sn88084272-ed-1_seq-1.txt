Religion Threatened With
Collapse in Southern
Republics.
Panama, Feb. 12. A complete col
lapse of the Christian faith in Latin
America was declared to be impending
in a report submitted today to the
Congress on Christian Work in Latin
America by the commiFsion on survey
and occupation.
The report declared that in all the
southern republics prai tically univer
sal unbelief exists as far as modern
learning has proceeded. The commis
sion asserts that the people in each of
the several countries may be roughly
divided Into four classes: A violent
anti-clerical party, manv of whom car
ry their opposition to religion of every
form: the more or less well-ieasoned
skeptics and atheists who look indul
gently upon religion as harmless for
women and for the lower classes, but
who are themselves Indifferent to Its
claims, the "dissatisfied, if not disil
lusioned and groping companies of
souls who soon pass on to cynicism and
hardness of heart;" those whose "pe
riod of doubt and breaking away is
ahead of them as they are overtaken
by free education"
Women Inhclleters Increase.
The report says that a surprising
number of women are beginning to
share the skeptmsm of their husbands
and that theosophy, spiritism and sim
ilar cults are rapidly taking the place
of Christianity In numerous sections.
In Holivia alone. It is claimed, three
fourths of the members of congress
and of the well to do business men and
nearly all of the government students
are sworn enemies of the church, while
similar, conditions prevail in practi
cally all the sister republics.
Reviewing the difficulties which con
front missionaries to Latin-America,
the report lays the blame for many of
the evil conditions which it enumer
ates, and dnlrnkenness in particular, to
the Influence of many American and
other foreign business agents who have
Tlie commission finds that in recent
decades Intemperance has increased
enormously in Latin-American coun
tries, largely .owing-lathe Introduction
of whisky. In the larger cities the rise
of whisky by foreigners Is declared to
be well nigh universal and to have a
most pernicious effect. Chile is declared
to be the chief victim of Intemperance,
tine traveler is quoted as saying that
there was more drunkenness In Chile
than in any 21 countries he had
visited.
Referring more specifically to the
relations between the United States
and Latin-America the commission vig
orously denounces the attitude of many
Americans toward their southern
neighbors for their intolerance and ar
rogance. "The Latin-American himself is not
KUiltless of vainglory," it says, "but
he has much to endure from the north
ern aliens within his borders. The of
fenders have been aggressive commer
cial agents, the plundering type of con
cessionaires, overbearing, arrogant
industrial managers and bosses, swag
gering tourists, ill-bred consular and
diplomatic representatives and, occas
ionally, condescending missionaries."
The commission finds, however, that
the United States and her citizens are
in process of mending their manners
and says the labors of the Pan-American
union in this respect are being re
warded. Americans Mistrusted.
At the same time it is asserted that
there Is a deep-rooted distrust of the
purposes of the United States on the
part of the Latin-Americans.
"Nothing is more deep-seated in the
Latin-American mind," says the report,
"than doubt concerning the unselfish
ness of the United States in her for
eign policies on the western hemis
phere. No amount of benevolent pro
testations, no meritorious service of
the Monroe doctrine, efface the moral
effect of the annexation of Mexican
territory as a result of the war of
1848, the permanent occupation of Por
to Rico, even though acceptable to a
majoritv of the Porto Ricans. and the
circumstance of acquiring the canal.
Tho cnmmiasinn finds, however, that
the racial animosity between the north
ern and southern halves of the western
hemisphere is subsiding and says that
the cooperation of several powers in
the Mexican crisis has helped to bring
about a mucn pener leeiing.

WASHINGTON. D. C Feb. 12.
The liberality of various joint
land commissions in settling
claims for property taken in
the canal zone, has robbed the United
States of millions of dollars. Gen. Goe
thals today told the house interstate
commerce committee.
All of the land In the ten mile atrip
along the canal subject to claims would
not be forth more than $1,000,000, at its
103 value, when the treaty was made.
the general said, hut it Is likelv to cost
$17,000,000 or $18,000,000 at the rates
which have been paid.
Land Vnlues lloomed.
"The Joint land committees have ta
ken the ground that as we are a big
republic and they are poor, we should
ly liberally for their lands," the gen
eral said. "As a consequence the Values
have exceeded muoh those of 1383 nnd

Goethals said that in one case where a
parcel of land was worth $1 a hectare
in 1903, and an agreement had been
entered Into that it should be paid for
at this rate, the owner took the mat

obtained $25 a hectare. Chairman
Adamson spoke of a case where land
that had sold for $1500 had been taken
in at $360,000 by the commission and
the general said lie, too. had heard

THE EYES OF LINCOLN
By Walt Mason
SAD eyes, that we:e patient and tender, sad eyes, that were steadfast and
true, and warm with the unchanging splendor of courage no ills could
subdue! Eyes dark with the dread of the morrow, and woe for the day
that was gone, the sleepless companions of sorrow, the watchers that witnessed
the dawn. Eyes tired from the clamor and goading, and dim from the stress
of the years, and hollowed by pain and foreboding, and strained by repression
of tears. Sad eyes that were wearied and blighted, by visions of sieges and wars,
now watch o'er a country united from the luminous slopes of the stars!

A third important Russian advance

Prevents German Shift.
While it is admitted that these oper
ations have no immediate strategic
value, it is believed in military circles
that the new Russian offensive baa
prevented the Germans from with
drawing troops from this front, thereby
lessening the chances of successful at
tacks on allied lines elsewhere.
The initiative on the Dvinsk front
remains in German hands, but the mild
weather of the last month, threaten

by the Germans on marshy ground, is
seriously handicapping their efforts to
