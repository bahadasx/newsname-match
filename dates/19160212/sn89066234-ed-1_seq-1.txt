m PLUTE IDEA OF LIBERTY
Corporation Lawyer Root Fears We
Will Lose Ours.Wants Army.
f nil the corporation lawyer,
F.iihu Hoot of Se w York li recoj"
nizod m tin- molt sarvlcanie to
the plundering Interests. Fot
time it looked is ir tho Plunder
bund would oITci- Hoot ns n pros
ldcntinl candidate on tin- Repub-
ltoaa ticket, but thladanier seems
to have blown over. He is tho
chap who instructs the Big nus'
nens Interests on how to uss the
law ns n "Jimmy" to burvtiarhse
tho people,
Like nil capitalist politician.
Knot pen ' s abo t "our liberties.'
He think we need a big army
and lets the cat out what for.
He sn.vs tho danger is within- the
ngitntors of "false doctrine.'
While he doesn't Bay nn plainly,
yet he and his tribe fear the
awakening of tho working eins
In a speech before the Now York
bar association ho siid concern"
.ing "our'' liberty.
"But there la another way i'i
which we must be prepared to de
fend it. and this Is necessary t i
the flrat. VV(6 must be prepari
to defend It WITHIN ns analwd
all Indifference and false doe trine
against all willingness to sub

OF A MAJORITY.'1
Mr. Hoot and his client an- alt i
afraid of the "Ignorant roreltrn
et v' who en mo here, These for
eigners do not remain as docile
ns is desired. They are brought
hero in drove by tho labor-shln-nlng
employers, They nre told
of 'the liberty and of the freedom
that win io theirs when they
come to the United States.
in this way they have awaken
ed In them a longing for the
Promised Land They sa rlfloe
everything and make the voyage
the land of so-called freedom
nd when they not hero they
go to work, work, work only to
find that they are no les
slaves here than in the land they
left.
Finally conditions become un
bearable even for these ignorant
slaves and they strike, as was the
ease In YoungStOWn, Ohio, las
month, where eighteen thousand
unorganized workers walked out
And when so many unorganized
Workers of different nationalities
i riko. the conditions must be
fierce, Concerning Mr. Hoots
'liberty' talk, Allen L. Benson
cvrlte In the Appeal to Reason
This conscienceless corporation
lawyer dares to talk about Amer
ican liberty 1 Does he know what
liberty means? Does he think ii
means the right to go hungry
and unhoused? Does he think !
means that the capitalist shall
have the right to pay the lowest
wages for which he can got
"help'' and that the "help'' shall
have th right to accept the best
wages they can get, even thougl
they be low? When Mr. Root
prates of liberty, does he mean
that the government should stand
iloof while the powerful rich are
bonding to their terms the week
poos. Does he believe that the
'men of Concord Bridge,'" who
for great navy purposes, he 10
much adores does ho believe
these embattle I farmers cave up
their lives that their descendants
might have the liberty freely
to roam the country searching
for work'.'
"whoever knows tho real views
, r Mr. Boot and his employer
knows only too well the kind of
"liberty' for which both he and
they stand. The kind of liberty
for Which they stand is a lie. In
no proper sense of the word is i
liberty at all. It is highly refined
slavery, it is savory In which
the shackles are it sefJh. but it
is not slavery in which the shack
les are not felt. The shackles arc
there. They are stronger thai
stool. They are as strong as the
love of life and the love of homo.
The love of life aud the love oi'
homo say to the worker: "Jn
out and work.' Tho capitalist
system says: 'Take what I of
fer, or the next man will.'' Some
times the capitalist system off
ers nothing. In any event, love
of life and love of home nre tho
shackles that bind the worker,
He has no choice. He must ac
cept. And this Mr. Root and his
kind, call 'liberty.'' If the God
dess of liberty '1 his silver coin
could use her arm-, she W 11 1
land a blow on the point of his
Jaw that would make his head
rook,
"Any liberty that is worth the
sacred name for which, through
"out the ages, so much blood ims
liocn shed, Is not the kind of lib
erty that Mr. Root so much fears
we shall lose. The kind of liberty
that Mr. Root Is devoted to is a
kind that we should lose. Tho
sooner we lose it, the better off
we shall be. If foreigners can
help us lose it, God-speed them
to our shores and may not the
capitalist politicians bribe all of
them before they reach the bal
lot boxes. I say this, whose fore
fathers lived in America 200
years before Mr. Root was born.
The only kind of liberty that is
worth having in this or any oth
r country is the kind under
which one man's rights go only so
far as they may without interfer
ing with the euual rights of al!
others. Does such liberty exist
here? Let us see. Have you as
much liberty as Rockefeller? Un
der the law, be has the liberty of
I taking par- of what you earn
whether you run an automobile
j or work la a conl mine -what
ever you do he la taking par. of
your earnings, Are you taking
any part of biaearnlngs? when,
since he was h boy did he ever
earn anything? If Rockefeller Is
not a ween, tho word should he
I removed from the dlotlounry
And every capitalist, I ix and lit
tle, is a leech upon labor To
oiooo-si'oK ine toners .is one m
the liberties'' that, under th
capitalist system, they enjoy I
you enjoy this sort ol liberty, ni
you experience it from your end
of the bloody pio-line .'
"in this country the substance
of pretty much everybody's lib
erty has leen regulated out nf
existence, leaving only the she !
Wo have the right to do almost
everything, without tho power to
do much or anything except to
to struggle fl iperately for s poor
lit Ing '
"When liberty is 'controlled by
tiie state In this manner, Mr 11 ot
has nothing to .- i.v He turns in
an alarm only when he rears we
may thoughtlessly adopt the hab
it Inculcated in Europe by social
ists of Interfering with the power
of capitalists to exploit labor to
the limit
Said a Hatch edit r to me the
other day, "This is the cold-blooded
country of the world.' He be
longs to one of the best-known
families In Holland, speaks half n
dozen languages, and has traveled
pretty much everywhere We
had boon talking Of the extent to
which Socialism had compelled
land. France, Bt rmany and Eng
land to enact Old ago pension
laws and other social legislation,
and he had also told how. in Hol
land. In each village, there were
'commons' whore each resident
was enabled, without charge, to
pasture COWS and raise a garden
Then his mind turned to America
where he had been for a y ear He
spoke of tho homeless poor 'if
New York, the indifference wuh
which the rich view the enforced
idleness and sufferings of tho pe.

"If Mr. Root and his elien

the grafters, they would v..-l i.-

j Root and hi.s clients are luvai'ln
' hly in favor of anything with

I think that Socialism would bunko
the working class. Therefore they
I are opposed to it. Fur the same
reason, the working class should

trying to do is to take from own
ers what they do not earn, and
give it to the workers who do
earn it. This eann u be done with
out paining the owners the cap

WHEN THE MASS MOVES.
The real, the most dynamic
I force that is destined to bring

Any reforms which we may
j achieve, the social and economic
I Justice toward which we are
suiviiiK, me equality 01 opportu
nity which should be the right
and heritage of every child born
Into the world, must come from
the masses. The people themselv
es are the llfe-glvlng force of so
ciety. It is they who must act
and dare and do. The movement
for social achievement and hap
piness is greater than any foun
dation or any government.
Dehind each organization that
sets before Itself the task of add
ing to the sum total of social well
being is always the sirging sea ol
public action and sentiments; a
sea which knows no bounds, recog
nizes no "Isms" as the last work
on truth and Justice and which
carries all so-called great men
like so many whltecaps on the
crest of the waves. It is this all
emhraclng movement of the mass
es which is the supreme dictator
of modern life and to which the
will of every individual, however
great, must bene if the bending or
that will be necessary to the wel
fare of the social whole. Frank

FROM A DKM ( r at. '
The Kicker is Ih receipt of a
letter postmarked at Fornfelt
and signed "A Democrat.''
The letter is writen In type wri
ter and the wording and language
indicate thnt the author is Quite
a scholar. Rut lie refuses tO Sign
his name and therefore it is not
printed. No ' bushwhacking'' goc
HI the Kicker. But all are entitl
ed to bo heard over their signa
ture, However the loiter is a good
one and the author is evidently H
fonsptcioua Demo -rat who is be
ginning to dis nvcr that what t'
Kicker has 1moii sa , ini about th"
Democratic party of Scott coun
ty is true that it consists of
little group of capitalists down al
Sikeston known ;,- the "shade
tree ganii.' with the tail end in

Ho also complains of "squatter

that men who have been workln

Just now "the party' is having

JUST AN "HONEST MISTAKE.''
Last week one of tho Republi
can machine politicians of St.
Louis was hailed before a St
Louis judge to answer ai charge
of embextlement of official funds
in the sun of 05,000, The judge
of coure. tuenrd him losoe upon
the theory that lie had merolv
"overdrawn his accounts'Car-
I uthersvilie Democrat.
Sure) .lust another ''honest
; mistake.'1 The reason the Demo
crat mentioned it la because the
escaped crook is a ''Republican
j machine politician ' Had he been
la Democratic machine iKlitic'n'
the Democrat would have seen it
iu an entirely different light.
It all depends on who gets the
loot. A few years ago the book
of PemiSOOt county were audited
and officials io iml to be over for
ty thousand dollar- li rt, Will
the Democrat please tell us i;
those Democratic machi o politi
cians of its own county did not
receive quite as much considera
tion from "the law' as did the
Republican machine politician In
St. Louis
In neither i-a.se was any of the
loot returned to the people-Mind
nobody was punished, it was
just an ''honest mistake.' But

PEOPLE FEAR CHANGE.
Th,? masses are afraid of Social
ism because tbe press and pulpit
of the ruling class thunder
against It. The masses do not
Understand that these retainers
of capitalism du this to hold their
jobs, it is an Important part of
the performance, Let any so
called Christian minister get up
in his pulpit and plead the cause
of the poor aud oppressed as
Christ did, and his overfed bish
op gives bim his walking papers,
liet an editor do it and he Ib up
against the boycot of the "better
class."
Therefore the essentual thing is
more education among tbe mass
es. Th e Ignorance among tbe
workers concerning industrial
and government affairs la appall
ing. Even they who have what
passes for a fairly good educa
tion are as Ignorant of such mat
ters as they who oannot read at
all. Thts does not so happen by
accident, but Is purposely design
ed. The ruling class controls our
education. -
