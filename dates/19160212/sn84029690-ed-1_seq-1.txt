Because of the frequent failures. But
we use the word "cur" and guarantee

We don't care what others may
think or gay. We know what we are
doing and will sell you B. A. Thomas

About 1865 he moved to Missouri and
later, in 1877, to Kansas. He was
brought up a Presbyterian, joined the
Congregational church in Missouri, and
the Baptist church after coming to
Hays. He died February 5, 1916, at
the age of 82 years, 7 months and 2
days. He leaves surviving, his daugh

Communicated.
Tg The Free Press:
No doubt all of the citizens of this
town are desirous that Hays become
one of the cleanest towns of Kansas.
This cannot be accomplished by a few;
but a few can make a town a dirty one.
The condition of the streets and alleys
of this city cannot be seen by one walk
ing along the street, but one who
drives over almost every street and
through almost every alley, can very
easily see this. Man' people throw
their ashes and tin cans into the streets
or alleys. It is all very nice to have a
nice, clean yard, but would'nt it be far
better, to select a small spot in your
yard for the purpose of putting your
ashes and cans, than to scatter that
same refuse over a whole alley. These
ashes often contain nails, horses step in
them, and autos often have tire trouble
from them. The throwing of wash
water is also a great nuisance, this
water freezes, and makes a slippery
place, causing horses to slip and fall.
Is there no other place except the street
or alley for refuse? G. G.

means the price Europe is now paying."
