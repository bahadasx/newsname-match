that the United States -m asked

Flood of .the house committee on
foreign affairs and Vice Prcs't Mar
shall. Sec'y Lansing's views wore
set forth as follows:
"When Sec'y of State Imsim;'.
attention was called to'the interview
purporting to have, been given by
the German chancellor, he said that
while he disliked to comment on
press dispatches of this sort, its
authoritative character seemed to
require.it in order that a wrong im
pression might be removed. lie
went on to say that he was at a loss
io understand what the chancellor
meant by the requirement.- of this
government being an "Impossible
humiliation."
"He said that nothing had been
asked of Germany which was not
reasonable and fair and with which
a nation could not comply without
doing violence to its honor and dig
nity: that this government's de
mands had not been increased since
they were made on May It last:
that it had sought in every way in
the controversy to show greatest
consideration to the German govern
ment and people thro igh its efforts
to this end apparent'y been misin
terpreted, it would continue to do so
in order that this unfortunate dis
pute may. if possible, be honorably
arranged out of a sincere wish to
maintain the traditional friendly re
A t 11 .
lations between the United States I
and Germany."
Following is the statement as t" 1
Sen. Stone:
"Sen. Stone declared that It is his;
confident belief that no officer con-j
nected with the government of the'
Fnited States has any wish or pur-j
lose to Humiliate tne i;erman go -eminent
or the German people.
Furthermore he. did not believe that
it is W ithin the power of any go em
inent official here to humiliate Ger
many." I Rep. Flood said:
1 "I do not think that there exists
; any desire on the part of any one
1 connected with the American gov
I .rnment to require or attempt to re
quire any action on the part of thej
i German government that would in;
the least humiliate Germany. (Hin
!goernment and our people are most '
friendly toward Germany and this,
i government has only demanded
what has been al3olutely necessary!
'under the circumstances. There is,
I certainly no desire to take from Ger-'

International News Service:
CHICAGO. Fel. 12. Details of
a sinister plot by a supposed fan
atic, whose inflamed mind impelled
him to attempt wholesale murder j
of the guests at the banquet given ;
Archbishop George William Munde- j
lein at the University club Thursday '
night, were in the hands of police ;
and club otlicials today. The 1h,
prominent guests at the banquet
who became violently ill after eat-'
ing the soup served at the banquet I
were all recovered today, but their
sudden illness was the subject of;
a rigid inquiry.
"There is no doubt," said N. J. j
Doherty, manager of the club, "that
the poisoning of the banquet guests
was the result of the plot of a single
man to kill the hundreds at the
tables. We know who the man is
and we have found a well equipped
laboratory of poisons in his quar
ters, including hundreds of vials of
deadly poisons of a dozen varieties.
We expect his arrest today."
Doherty also said that the litera
ture found in the man's rooms in
cluded anarchistic propaganda, I.
W. AS", pamphlets and writings by
Emma Goldman. Doherty spoke of
the literature as a "library of hate."
He said the receptacles in which
the poison was brought to the Uni
versity club kitchei were found,
only partly emptied. His theory
was that the poisoner was inter
rupted before he completed his plan,
and that this accounted for the fact
that only part of the guests be
came ill instead of all of them be
ing killed. '
We hae not determined the na
ture of the poison the man used."
said Doherty. "It likely was a con
coction of his own, a combination of
poisons that he had conceived as
especially deadly. Our theory
that he useo arsenic, mereunous
nitrate and copper salts."
Doherty said the police were not
called into the investigation until
the evidence against the prisoner
was nearly completed. He said they
made no answer to the statement
of Dr. John Dill Robertson. city
health commissioner, that the
club's kitchen was not clean, be
cause they knew that when the facts
of the case were made public Dr.
Robertsons's statement would look
ridiculous."
Samples of the poisoned soup
were turned over to Prof. Edwin o.
Jordan, of the University of Chi
cago, to be analyzed. Cultures will
be made of the samples and will lie
Ltried n guinea pigs and rabbits.
