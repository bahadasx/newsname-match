Hays, Kansas, ilarch 9, 10, 11,. 1916
Members of School Boards:
Let us have a "big and profitable
. meeting at Havs next spring. The
Dine counties of the Golden Belt have
over 1 (00 members of school boards
and 750 teachers. You and I who are
members of these boards hare the
same problems. Some of us have
been trying for ten years, some for
forty years to solve them, and some
are just starting' on the work. But
we have never come together to talk
over cur official troubles and
successes. We do not know how other
boards meet the diificulties that we
have to meet. There have -been a few
good county - meetings of. boards but
not in every county. There has been
a good state meeting each year for
several years but that is to far away .
for most of us, and has too many cities
. boards members to give special attent
ion to ; problems of the short , grass
country. Come on to our Golden
Belt meeting at Hays City. March
9, 10,- 11, 1916. -Write me at once
what you want to hear discussed. Is
It terms, teachers, health, standard
ization, or vocational subjects? Is it
county unit, or consolidation, or
athletics, or morals? Is it recommen
dations or qualifications of teachers?
Is it school houses, or grounds, or
sanitation, or taxation, or rural high j
schools or something else?
Write me a li.ne at once, and plan j
tj come Hays to better the rural j
schools and small towns also. I

Since Sam Drybread lives near Elk
river it is hoped that he will at least
have water to go w ith it.

And there is that Texas family,
named "Few," and there are only
fiTteen in the bunch.
- '" ,. '
JSuX-tlien, there is mighty little in
a name. Shalrach,. Meshach and
Abednego were hard to kill, despite
their names, and even Thuselah lived
to a ripe old age.

How solicitous our friends are for
our welfare. A recent family letter
said "we are all well, except colds,
and hope this w ill find you the same."
It did.

Aunt Simpy is disconsolate. She
has no entry for the better babies
contest, she didn't get to see the
presidents wife, and there wont be a
decent wash day for six weeks to come.
Xo, we didn't see the groundhog,-
nor the eclipse of the sun. We
haven't had a word to say about
either and w e shall give St. Valentine
the same treatment. But by the way,
if the moon happened to look this
way and saw her shadow, what sort
of w eather could we expect?
Old Si says, "I'd rather have what
I want and pay for what I get than
to have some fellow put something
over onto me that I don't want, and
he knows I dont want it, even tf he
should pay the freight and throw in
a chromo." . -
It wouldn't do for me to be a preach
er for I'd certainly die of disappoint
ment. I'd be most likely to prepare
sermons, hot and spicy, for the
especial good of certain parishioners,
and then it would be jnst my luck to
have those particular people stay at
home when the time for delivery
come.
Ever notice how extra good and
fitting the sermon is for the other
fellow? Then how mean and little
it is for him to stay away, or refuse
to take his medicine.
o ' .
How we all fool ourselves. Just
when we imagine our wings are
sprouting, other folks see signs of
horns protruding.
The contract for the construction
of a bridge across Spring - Creek near
Ogallah was let to Charles Lofstead
by the County Board. Charley will
do the work light.
More than . 100 loads of corn and
wheat were delivered at this market
last Monday. Also (wo carloads of
hogs. Voda reported its elevators
full and Col Iyer has stopped buying on
account of room for storage. A short
age of cars is reported. The delivery
continued all through the week, the
congestion being relieved and the crop
moving again.

The Weather of January 1916 in Kansas
Issued by the Section Center of the
Weather Bureau at Topeka, Kansas,
February, 4, 1916.
January, 1916, was a cold, cloudy
ana Disagreeable month in all parts
of Kansas, with abrupt tern

a record breaker oa . account of the
unusual amount of rain, sleet arid
snJvjlhat fell, according, to reports
frouc 120 stations of the Weather
Bureau that cover conditions in
practically every county.
It was the coldest month the state
has experienced since December, 1914,
and the - coldest January since 1912.
Temperature averaged below normal
in all parts, with the greatest de
ficiencies in . the western counties.
The highest temperature reported
was n degrees at Cimarron on the
4th and the lowest 22" degrees below
zero at Irene on the. 13th. Changes
of 40 to 60 degrees in temperature
within 24 hours time occured at a
great many stations during the first
week. ,
The average precipitation (rain)
melted snow and sleet) over the east
ern third was 4.0S inches; the middle
third, 1.29 inches: the western third,
0.62 inch; and for the entire State,
2.13 inches, or 1.45 inches, above nor
mal. It was, with one exception, the
wettest January on record. The ex
cess in moisture extended to almost
every county. Nearly all the eastern
hail oi the btate and some south
western counties reported monthly
amounts in excess of one inch while
some extreme southeastern counties
had more than seven inches. ,
The snowfall was above normal but
was very irregularly distributed,
amounts in adjoining counties often
varying from 4 to 8 inches. Most of
it fell during the last -three weeks
and was badly mixed with sleet.
Sleet and freezing rain on the 2Gth
left the eastern half of Kansas nearly
all covered with a solid sheet of ice
from half an inch to two inches thick
Telegrah and telephone wires and
poles were broken down, especially in
the northeastern counties, and fears
are entertained that the wheat may
be seriously damaged as the ice was
still on when the month closed. The
western half of the State and most of
the extreme northern counties escaped
the worst of this storm and no damage
was done to wheat or stock in those
parts.
Mrs. V. Malinowsky and family of
Voda, entertained Sunday at a sur
prise Birthday dinner in honor of V.
Malinowsky. All enjoyed -a bounti
ful dinner prepared by the hostess.
The guests departed at a late bour in
the evening wishing Mr. Malinowsky

' Death of Lester Lapp
Died last- Tuesday morning at the
home of his parents,Mr. and Mrs. A.
Lopp, of this city, Lester, aged 11
years, 5 months and 19 days. He ha
beenvsick ' about three weeks and.
death resulted from blood poison.
There is ever an ineffable sadness in
the death of a child. The catting off
of life in the care-free happy days of
early childhood when life seemingly
holds so much of promise carries a
poignant sorrow that is hard to bear.
But the future is ever unrevealed to
mortal eyes and oft times if it could
be we would be thankful that the life
of a well loved child had been spared
much of sorrow and pain by an early
transplanting into the Garden of the
Lord where of such is the Kingdom
of Heaven.
. On Thursday afternoon at 4 o'clock
the funeral services were held at the
Baptist church and conducted by
Rev. Allison. The body was taken
to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, for burial be
side two other children w ho died in
infancy.
