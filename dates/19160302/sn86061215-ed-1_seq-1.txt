D. jp.,
5,
March 1—At an
early conference at the white house
today President Wilson and adminis
tration leaders made plans for bring
ing the armed ship agitation In con
gress to an end at once with a demon
stration of unity to convince Germany
that the American congress stands be
hind the foreign policy of the govern
ment and thus relieve the president
of embarrassment in his negotiations
•with Germany.
Confident that they can beat all an
ti-administration resolutions by a
heavy vote, the president and the
leaders framed plans to bring them
out first on the floor of the house,
where they plan to defeat them and
put through a vote of confidence in
the president.
The president paved the way for his
action last night and incidentally sur
prised congress by calling on Acting
Chairman Pou of the house rules com
mittee to provide the parliamentary
machinery for immediate considera
tion of the resolutions on the floor.
Leader* Teld «f Plane.
At today's conference, to which the
president summoned Chairmen Stone
and Flood of the senate and house
committees dealing with foreign af
fairs, Senator Kern, democratic floor
lecder, Speaker Clark and Majority
Leader Kitchin of the house, he ex
plained his purpose fully.
The conference agreed that in def
erence to the wishes of President Wil
son a vote would be taken soon in sen
ate and house on resolutions warning
Americans to keep off the ships. Its
fprm will be determined later. After
the conference Chairman Flood called
hit committee together. It was almost
certain that the parliamentary situa
tion in both houses would prevent a
vote toiay.
The president made it clear that he
did not want a vote on a resolution
expressing support of his conduct of
the diplomatic controversy, and as a
result of his position the vote will be
taken on a resolution warning Ameri
cans off armed ships.
Speaker Clarke and Majority Lead
er Kitchin said no action could be
taken today in the house and that the
conference had been devoted chiefly
to discussing procedure.
The president told the leaders the
foreign situation wan no more serious
today than it has been for several
weeks but he believed action should
be taken quickly to show the world
the American government was not
divided.
Speaker Clark, who predicted last
week that a warning resolution would
pass 2 to 1 at that time, said he did
not know the sentiment of the house
now and refused to say how he him
self would vote.
Assurances
Not
Breed.
If Germany's latest assurances on the
conduct of'submarine warfare, pre
sented Monday by Count von Berns
tQrff, to Secretary Lansing, are not so
broad as the United States desires,
but it is indicated no further steps
will be taken by this government until
the administration is certain its aotlon
will not be embarrassed in congress.
The assurances reiterated in the
latest communication are regarded as
not so complete as those originally
given as the result of the Lusltanla
negotiations and it was indicated to
day that the pending LuBitania agree
ment would not be finally accepted as
satisfactory at this time.
House leaders today drafted for con
sideration of the house a measure pro
posing that congress express its con
fidence in the president's handling of
the armed merchantmen controversy
and recognize that it is not a matter
of legislative but of executive concern.
Chairman Flood of the foreign af
fairs committee sought to bring
democrats in line on the measure, to
be reported out of his committee, and
also sought ineffectually to get -assur
ances of republican cooperation.
"The president positively did not
ask for such a resolution," said Mr.
Flood, speaking of the new proposal.
"This form has been broached since I
returned from the white house confer
«ence/."
Pending the sounding of sentiment
on the resolution, the meeting of the
foreign affairs committee was post
poned from 1 o'clock to an indefinite
hour. Meantime leaders conferred on
the new proposal.

Enlistments Not Very Numerous on
Last Day for Voluntary Joining of-,

London, March. 1.—The newspapers
this morning dwell on the fact that
this is the last day for voluntary en
listment in the British army and that
it is also the first in what is called the
new German submarine campaign.
Large numbers of recruits presented
themselves during the last few days
at British recruiting officeB, to escape
the odium of being forcibly enrolled
under the compulsion act, but it is
remarked that there has been no over
whelming rush of recruits.

London, March. 1.—Germany has
sent an ultimatum to Portugal de
manding the restoration within forty
eight hours of the German ships re
cently seized by that country, accord
ing to a dispatch from Madrid to Ren
ter's Telegram Co.
The first seizure of German mer
chant vessels by Portugal occurred
February 23 at Lisbon when the naval
authorities took thirty-six German and
Austrian ships in the Tagus. On Feb
ruary 25 the seizure of eight German
steamships by the Portuguese authori
ties at St. Vincent, Cape Verde
islands, was announced.
A Lisbon dispatch on February 26
quoted Premier Costa of Portugal as
declaring in the chamber of deputies
that the government action in requi
sitioning vessels had been prompted
by the necessities of the nation's
economic situation.

They add that the Bahia office of tlie

been somewbat lessened and east of
Verdun the French have been able
with their artillery to stop German
preparations for further advances to
ward the fortress.
Dispatches received here declare the
situation north of Verdun satisfactory
to the French, who have strongly for
tified their positions from Cote du
Poivre, four miles due north, to Dou
aumont, three miles to the east, along
which line the German pressure above
Verdun has been heaviest. At Douau
mont itself several hundred Germans
are reported still cut olf in the front,
which the French have surrounded.
The Germans have captured an
armored work northwest of Verdun
and have taken the towns of Manu
huelles and Champion, thirteen miles
southeast of Verdun. Berlin reports
that they have taken prisoner 228 of
ficers, 16,575 men and captured a large
number of guns and much war mater
ial.
The German advance to the east of
Verdun has extended over a front of
virtually twelve miles—from Dieppe to
Champion.
The Havas agency says:
"In a word the German offensive has
been suspended but not stopped. It
would be risky at present to say
whether the pause is due to the fact
that the Germans realize that all ef-
'are simply defending' positions the?
have so dearly bought or whether the
German troops are merely resting be
fore being hurled forward again to the
assault."
There are signs of German prepara
tion behind the front west of Pont-a
Mousson eighteen miles southwest of
Metz and in the Moselle river region.
The French guns have been pounding
the second and third line German
positions here, while an intermittent
bombardment has been going on at
various points between Regnievillo
and Reraenauville, some half dozen
miles west of Pont-a-Mousson.
Apparently the recent German at
tack in the Champagne was nothing
more than one of the numerous local
operations such as the Germans car
ried out in several sectors of the from
preceding the Verdun offensive, as it
has not been followed up.
GERMANS TELL OF VICTORY.
Berlin, March 1. —German corres
pondents at the Verdun front state
that on February 22 the German troops
gained ground only ten square
Kilo­
meters less than the total captured by
the French in their offensive move
ment in the Champagne last fall.
The German attack was carefully
prepared by tfeavy shelling of the
French defensive works in the forests
where barbed wire had been tied from
tree to tree. The wire, intermingled
with branches of the trees, formed a
yielding barrier particularly well de
signed to resist artillery fire.
When the German troops charged
they not only swept through these
positions but advanced beyond more
distant defense works before the
French were able to rally their scat
tered troops. The correspondents re
peat the earlier reports that the Ger
man losses were surprisingly small
while the French, on account of the
well timed collaboration of the Ger
man infantry and artillery, suffered
heavy casualties. It is said that hun
dreds of French dead, crowded cloeely
together, were found in some small
sections. The French lines was broken
on. both sides of the road leading
northward from Verdun.
FRENCH FEEL SAFE.
Paris, Feb. 29.—(Delayed)—That
the situation around Verdun is now
well In hand and considered quite
satisfactory from the French point of
vi^w is freely stated by the military
experts. To the northeastern part of
the stronghold the chief effort of the
Germans seems to be directed to the
rescue of the Brandenburgers, who
are cooped up in the ruined fortress
of Douaumont.
Both sides are profiting by the peri
od of comparative calm to bring up
fresh forces and supplies of ammuni
tion. While It is realized that the
Germans have not yet reached the
limit of their offensive resources, it
is stated that any fresh onslaught on
their part is awaited by the French
with supreme confidence in their abil«
ity to hurl it back.
STRIKERS TO GIVE IN?

MAYOR THOMPSON IS REBUKED
IN MANY WARDS WOMEN'8
VOTE IS SMALL.
Chicago, March 1.—Both administra
tion and anti-administration men
claimed victory today after analyzing
the vote at the aldermanic primaries
yesterday.
Mayor Thompson pointed to a total
of twenty-seven republican aldermanic
nominations supported by him as evi
dence of victory. Anti-administration
forces based their claim 6f success on
the fact that seven of the "rebel nine"
aldermen, as Thompson's principal
antagonists were styled, had been
nominated. Mayor Thompson lost his
home ward (twenty-third) by 2,600.
Fred Lundin, the mayor's chief poll
tical adviser, carried his ward (thirty
third) by 8,200.
One of the surprises was the vote
in the seventh ward, a republican
stronghold and the home of Alderman
Charles E. Merrlam, leader of the an
ti-administration forces, where Alder
man John N. Kimball was renominat
ed by 158 votes. He will probably
face a recount. Kimball was one of
the "rebel nine" and a spirited cam
paign was made for and against him.
His friends expected victory by) sev
eral thousands.
Both of the republican factions de
clared their determination today to
continue the fight.
In the democratic primaries friends
of Roger C. Sullivan, who battled with
supporters if Former Mayor Carter
H. Harrison, declared that they won
in thirty-one of the thirty-five wards.
The woman vote was considerably
lighter than waa looked for and
amounted to but 32.8 per cent of the
total woman registration. The male
vote was 88 per cent of registration.
Yesterday's primary female vote as
compared with that cast in the 1915
primary was: 1916, 162,363 1916,
