ZAPATA TO JOIN DIAZ
cv'v Revolution in Mexico Is Now
Assuming Large Proportions.
KI Paso. Texas. March 2. Kmiliano
Zapata will be allied with Felix Diaz in
the fight to overthrow Carranza. ac
cordlng to former Mexican federal
army officers, who arrived here today
from the Interior of Mexico. Two of
ficers of Zapata's command in More
lOfl reached the border in disguise and
brought the news that representatives
of General Diaz had conferred with
the bandit chief.
They said that Zapata had at least
25.000 men under arms at Morel os
and Oaxaca. With this force added to
the 20.000 said to be awaiting General
Diaz in Oaxaca. the strength of the
new revolution becomes apparent.
Carranza military and civil officials
continue to laugh at the reports of a
new revolution. They say it will have
short duration.
Agents of the department of justice
are busy trying to discover whether
th1 Diaz faction has established a
Junta in Paso. So far. no regular
"headquarters" has appeared. There
is much curiosity as to whether Villa
will join forces with the new anti-Car-ranza
element. His representatives
here say that the northern leader has
agreed to co-operate providing Diaz
has sufficient financial backing.

Baby Carriage
Defeats Motive
War Regulation
London, March 2. -The baby
carriage has been put to a new
use in some of the East Coast
towns. The lighting regulations
make it a misdemeanor to use a
flash lamp in the streets during
these nights of precaution against
Zeppelin attacks, but at the same
time the law insists that a peram
bulator must carry a lamp. Some
ingenious individuals have hit up
on the idea of pushing baby car
riages around at night to light
their way, and still keep within
the law.

Lisbon, March 2. Sixty leading
members of the German colony left
hurriedly for Spain today on receipt
of reports that Germany is about to
declare war on Forttigal. The major
ity of the German business houses
have been closed.
The foreign office is reported to
have dispatched the answer last night
to the German note demanding the
release of interned German ships
seized by official decree. It is rumor
ed that the Portuguese answer is very
brief but contains a flat refusal to
comply with - the German demands.
Kaiser's Envoy to Move.
It is rumored that German minis
ters will leave Portugal this afternoon.
No confirmation of this report was
obtainable at the embassy or the for
eign office but it is generally believed
there will be important developments
within' 24 hours.
The president conferred until a late
hour last night with his cabinet and
also with other political leaders who
were summoned to the foreign office.
The reply to the German demands is
said to have been framed at this con
ference and to have been telegraphed
to fcserim berore midnight.
Departure of Germans from Lisbon
continued today. It is estimated hat I
about 200 German business men have j
gone to Spain.
I (old German Ships.
The first seizure of German nr?r- i
chant vessels by Portugal occurred
February 23 at Lisbon when the naval
authorities tdbk possession of 36 Ger
man and Austrian ships in the Tagus.
On February 2 5 the seizure of eight
German steamships by the Portuguese
authorities at St. Vincent, Cape Verde
islands, was announced and it was un
officially declared that the requisi
tioning of German and Austrian ves
sels had been extended to all those
lying in the ports of Portugal and her
colonies.
A Lisbon dispatch on February 26
quoted Premier Costa of Portugal
as declaring that the government's
action in requisitioning vessels had
been prompted by the necessities of
the nation's economic situation. The
premier further declared that he con
sidered it to the best interest of Por
tugal that the existing treaty with
Germany be allowed to lapse and that
the Portuguese government was pre
pared for all eventualities that night
arise.
There have been frequent rum,rs
since- the outbreak of hostilities that
Portugal was about to declare a state
of war with the central powers be
cause of her treaty relations with

STONE ANO WILSON DISAGREE
Administration Leader Believes
President Is Wrong.
Woodrow Gamely Demands a
Showdown in Congress.
Washington, March 2. The
armed ship issue suddenly blaz
ed up in the senate today with
the most sensational debate of
the session in which Senator
Gore, Democrat, and author of a
resolution to warn Americans
off belligerent vessels repeated
what he characterized as a re
port that President Wilson had
told certain congress leaders
that war between the United
States and Germany "might not
be ungrateful and might result
in advancing civilization by
bringing about the end of the
European war by mid-summer."
Chairman Stone of the foreign rela
tions committee emphatically denied
that the president ever had expressed
anv such sentiment in his hearing and
Senator James another administration
leader demanded to know why Senator
Gore had not sought to confirm the
report from the president himself.
The Storm Breaks.
The storm broke in the senate un
expectedly when Senator Stone, an
nouncing that he was not in acconl
with the president's demand for a de
feat of the armed ship resolutions pro
posed a means to let the Gore resolu
tion come to a vote and Senator James
announced that the administration
forces had the votes to defeat it.
The debate ended without action and
the senate passed to other business
with the prospect of taking up the
Gore resolution at an early hour to
morrow. Senator Gore declared that at the
proper time he would put squarely
before the senate whether the sink
ing of an armed merchant vessel by
a submarine would be considered suf
liclent cause for war.
"I introduced my resolution because
I was apprehensive we were heading
toward war," said Gore. "My act was
leased on a report which seemed to
me to come from the highest author
ity that certain senators and mem
bers of the house in a conference
with the president received from him
the intimation if not the declaration,
that if Germany insisted on her po
sition the United States would insist
upon hers, and that this would re
sult probably in a breach of diplomat
ic reiations, and a breach would prob
ably be followed by a state of war.
and that a state of war might not be
an evil, might not be ungrateful, might
end the war by midsummer, and thus
might render a great service to civil
ization. I cannot certify to the truth
of the report. I tell the tale as it was
told to me. There were such external
and internal marks of truth that I
feared that it might be the truth.
Stone Flares Up.
Well, in fairness to the president,"
said Senator Stone. "I think I should
state that the president never stated
to me ror stated in my hearing that
he believed or m any way entertained
the thought that war between the
United States and the central powers
would be desirable or would result in
any good, or would not be ungrate
ful." "It is well known that the presi
dent has a passion for peace," inter
jected Senator Kern, in a tone which
indicated a flat denial of Senator
Gore's charge.
"I have no passion for peace," Sen
ator Gore responded. "I do not be
lieve all peace is honorable or that all
war is dishonorable, but I repeat that
what I heard of the reported conver
sation between the president and sena
tor from Missouri, I believed to be
founded on fact because of the source
from which it came to me. I was
convinced that there must be some
basis for the report that the president
suggested to the senator from Missouri
that the United States might bring the
war to a close in the middle of the
summer.''
Senator Stone jumped to his feet a
second time.
"The president of the United States
made no such statement as quoted by
the senator from Oklahoma,"
Stone declared emphatically.
President's Words Sacred.
"Whatever the president did say is
something that I do not care to re
peat. Whenever I go to the White
House, for a conference with the pres
ident what he says to em is sacred. T
have not repeated the conversation I
had with thep resident. I have stated
impressions the conversation made on
my mind. I stated in substance my
impressions in my letter to the presi
dent which was made public."
"I made no intimation that the sen
ator from Missouri had repeat
ed the conversation. "Senator
Washington. March 2. Administra

EIGHT BABY DAYS
FOR KANSAS IN

Every Preacher Will Take Up
Subject in Topeka.
300,000 LOST NEEDLESSLY
More Than 400 Communities in
AH Parts of U. S.
Every City of Any Size in Kan
sas Will Take Part.
Governor Capper today designated
the eight days from March 4 to
March 11 as Better Baby Week in
Kansas. In doing this, the proclama
tion reads, the governor is acting in
harmony with the suggestion of the
Child Welfare Bureau of the United
States department of labor in Wash
ington, and the Kansas division of
hygiene.
"I ask all thoughtful citizens who
appreciate their responsibility to the
future of the state to co-operate with
public officials and private associa
tions in the study of many problems
effecting child culture and the con
servation of child life." said the gov
ernor in his proclamation. "This to
the end that the coming generation
may fulfill its duty to those who come
after us."
Dr. Lydia UeVilbiss of the state di
vision of hygiene, announced today
that many Kansas towns had signified
their intention of giving American
babies their just dues during Better
Baby Week. Kach town will plan
its own program.
Sermons by Topekuns.
Jn Topeka, the Good Government
club has written to every minister in
the city requesting that the baby be
the subject of a sermon on Sunday.
March It is probable an elaborate
program for "Baby Week" in Topeka
will be announced later.
To Save Part of 300,000.
The saving of 300,000 babies whose
lives are needlessly snuffed out every
year in the United States is the aim of
leaders in the nation-wide better baby
week.
More than 400 communities have
laid plans for baby week, aided by the
children's bureau of the United States
department of labor. During baby
week the needs of children will be so
presented that all parents in these
' communities will realize these needs
and will want to give their children
the best possible care. They will
know that this is their privilege, as
well as their obligation.
The men and women behind this
movement are trying to do away with
the old belief that the rate of mor
tality among children who had not
reached the first anniversary of their
birth was a wise dispensation of na
ture to prevent children with a weak
constitution from becoming too plen
tiful. In its place they are trying to make
mothers realize that p. great infant
mortality is a national disaster.
Poverty, ignorance and disease are
the three chief causes of the innual
death toll amonr: b?bies and of
these ignorance perhaps is most di
rectly responsible for the waste of life.
proposed however that the senate
take an adjournment instead of an
other recess and thereby get into a
new legislative day relieving the par
liamentary situation which thus far
has held Senator Gore s resolution
from coming to a vote. His action was
taken after a conference of adminis
tration leaders who were satisfied
they had the votes to defeat the Gore
resolution and demonstrate to Ger
many that the dissensions against the
president's foreign policy do not have
the support of congress.
Y i lson V i U JLose i n Senate ?
"It has been decided to bring the
resolution up for action as soon as
possible, but probably not today." said
Senator J3 mes of Kentucky, one of
the administration supporters. "We
have got the votes in the senate to
smash it."
Senator Stone at the outset of his
proposal made a statement of the in
ternational situation as he understood
it. Senator Stone declared it was his
hope that something could be done
at once to bring the president and
congress more closely in accord on the
issue and that he was framing a sub
stitute for all pending resolution on
the subject. Senator Lodge of Massa
chusetts, ranking Republican member
of the foreign relations committee de
clared he was in accord with Senator
Stone's desire for prompt action, and

In view of the fact that the Atchison
