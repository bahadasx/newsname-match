Stubbs fell, having no means of
protection. When the shots were
fired residents in that vicinity were
awakened and the family of M.
Marx were among the first. They
heard groans and one of the boys
rushed to his assistance and by this
time others arrived. The injured
man was taken to the hospital and
an examination revealed that he
had been shot through the left:i

According to the imformation the
police have in hands, Stubbs had
quarrelled with another man early
in the evening but it was not con
sidered anything serious as no blows
were even exchanged. Chief of
Police Magee visited Stubbs at theI
hospital and the injured man told
him that he was postive that he was
shot by a white man, and is said to
have gave the names of two parties

Cutrer and his friends appear to
be anxious for a return match and
providing quarters can be secured
that are more centrally located a
return match may be arranged in
the near future.
CAi SHORTACE EFFECTS
BUSINESS IN BOGCAUSA
Due to the fast that several oft
the railroads are enjoying the great
est business in their history and
connected with the fact that as a
embargoes are in effect at many of
the greatest harbors and the inaba
lity of the ships to move the grain
and supplies to Europe the car short
age has effected Bogalusa and has
been delaying shipments here for
two weeks with indications that the
shortage of cars will continue for
some time. Cars of every shape
and size are wanted and those who
want them are glad to get any
kind, The N 0 G N recently had
every car they owned and could get I
hold of placed in good condition
and today the supply is not great
enough to meet the demand which
will show that this road is now en
joying a great business.

"General business conditions
throughout the country ale good,
due to a large extent to the tremen
dous amount of business brought
about by the European War. The
people of the country are now alive
to the necessity for adequate mili
tary preparednes;. They realize that
we are really unprepared at the
present time, and I think they are
now beginning to realize tlMt the
dangers which threaten us are real
and not imaginary."
'The car Shortage may interfere
with the operation of the plant of
the Great Southern Lumber Com
pany, as piling ground in our yard
space is limited, and we are now
piling coinsiderable lumber each
month in order to keep everyore
employed."
ficer but when it was known the
Parish authorities could not furnish
relief .or several days Miss Rowan
"visited the home and found condi
tions such that it is impossible to
describe. Two of the children were
brought to Bogalusa. One was a
boy about 5 years old that appeared
to be on the verge of starvation.
His little body was clad with thin
and torn material and his body
seemed to be shaking from hunger.
His little arms and legs were no
arger than those usually found on
a two year old child. It was a case
that would arouse the deepest sym
pathy from the coldest heart. The
little fellow, with his brother was
taken to a Bogalusa home where he
is being properly cared for while the
three older persons were sent to
New Orleans and are now receiving
medical treatment at Charity Hospi
tal.
