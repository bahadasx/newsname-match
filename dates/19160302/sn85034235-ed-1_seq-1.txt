while it kept his lips tight on the truth
of the existence of the other woman.
Again La bisk wee sighed.
"Very well. I lore you more than I
fear my father's anger, and he Is more
terrible in anger than a mountain
storm You told me what love is. This
Is the test of love. I shall help you to

••*•**•
Smoke awakened softly and without
movement. Warm, small fingers touch
ed his cheek and slid gently to a pres
sure on his lips. The one word
''Come" was breathed In his ear. He
sat up carefully and listened. Close
at hand he could distinguish the light
regular breathing of Snass.
Labiskwee tugged gently at Smoke's
sleeve and he knew she wished him
to follow. He took his moccasins and
German socks in his linDd and crept
out into the snow In his sleeping moc
casins. Beyond the glow from the
dying embers of the fire she indicated
to him to pnt on his outer footgear,
and while he obeyed she went back un
der the fly where Snass slept
Feeling the hands of his watch.
Smoke found it 'was 1 in the morning.
Labiskwee rejoined him and led him
on through the sleeping camp.
"Now' we can talk." she said when
the last fire had been left half a mile
behind.
In the starlight, facing him. Smoke
noted for the first time that her arms
were burdened, and, on feeling, dis
covered she (tarried his snowsboes, a
rifle, two belts of ammunition and his.
sleeping robes.
*'I have everything fixed." she said,
with a happy little laugh. "I have
been two days making the cache.
There is meat, even flour, matches and
skis, which go best on the hard crust,
and. when they break through, the
webs will Hold up longer. Oh. I do
know snow travel, and we shall go
fast, my lover."
Smoke checked his speech. That she
had been arranging tils escape was
surprise enough, but that she bad plan
ned to go with him was more than he
was prepared for Unable to plan im
mediate action, he gently, one by one,
took her burdens from her. He put
his arms around her and pressed her
close, and still he could not think what
to do.
"God is good," she whispered. "He
sent me a lover."
Yet Smoke was brave enough not to
suggest his going alone. And ere he
spoke lie saw all Ids memory of the
bright world reel and fade.
"Wo will go back. Labiskwee." he
said "You will lie my wife, and we
shall live always with the Caribou
people."
"No. no!" And her body, in the cir
rle of his arm. resented his proposal
"I know. I have thought much. The
hunger for the world would come upon
you. and in the long nights It would
devour your heart. Four Eyes died of
hunger for ihe world; so would you
die. And I will not have you die. We
will go on across the snow mountains
eu tile south traverse."
"Dear, listen." he urged "We must
go back."
She pressed her mitten against his
lips to prevent further speech. "Yon
;ove me. Say that you love me."
"I do love you. Labiskwee You are
my wonderful sweetheart."
Again the mitten was a caressing ob
stade to utterance. "We shall go on
lo the cache." she said with decision.
"It would be a great wrong to you to
go back. [_i am only a wild girl, and
I am afraid of the world, but 1 am
more afraid for you. You see. it is as
you told me. I hive you more than
anybody else in the world. 1 love you
more than myself. The Indian lan
guage is not a good language. The
English language is not a good lan
guage. The thoughts in my heart for
you. as bright and as many as the
stars—there is uo language for them
How can 1 tell you them? They are
there—see!"
As she spoke she slipped the mitten
from his hand and thrust the hand in
side the warmth of her parka until it
rested against lier breast. Tightly and
steadily she pressed his hand Id its
position. Aud in the ioug silence he
felt the beat, beat of her heart and
knew that every beat of it was love
And then slowly, almost imperceptibly.

"Wo will go back, Labiskwee. You will
be my wife."
still bolding his hand, her body began
to incline away from bis and toward
the direction of the cache. Nor would
he resist it was as if he were drawn
by her heart itself that so nearly lay
In the hollow of his hand.
So firm was tha crust that they slid
along rapidly on their skis.
"J ust here, in the trees, is the cache,"
Labiskwee told Smoke.
The next moment she caught his arm
with a startle of surprise. The flames
of a small tire were dancing merrily,
and crouched by the fire was McCan.
*T was minded you'd run without
me," McCau explained when they came
up. his small peering eyes glimmering
with cunning. "So I kept an eye on
the girl, an' wheu 1 seen her cachin'
skis an' grub 1 was on. I've brought
my own skis an' webs ud' grub Will
we be startin' now?"
Labiskwee looked swift consterna
tion at Smoke, as swiftly achieved a
judgment ou the matter and spoke
"McCau. you are a dog!" she hissed,
and her eyes were savage with auger.
"I know it is in your heart to raise the
camp if we don't take you. Very well.
We must take yon. But you know my
father. 1 am like my father. You will
do your share of the work. You will
obey. And if you play one dirty trick
it would be better for you if you had
never run."
Daylight fouud them lu the belt of
foothills that lay between the rolliug
country aud the mountains. McCan
suggested breakfast, but they held ou.
Labiskwee explained to Smoke her
knowledge of the country and the way
she planned to baffle pursuit. There
were but two ways out. one west, the
other south. Snass would immediately
dispatch parties of young men to guard
the two trails. But there was another
way south. True, it did no more than
penetrate halfway into the high moun
tains; then, twisting to the west and
crossing three divides, .it joined the
regular trail. When the young men
found no traces on the regular trail
they would turn back in the belief that
the escape had been made by the west
traverse, never dreaming that the run
awnys had ventured the harder and
longer way around
Glancing back at McCan, in the rear.
Labiskwee spoke in an undertone to
Smoke. "He is eating." she said. "It
is not good.''
Smoke looked. The man was secret
ly munching caribou suet from the
pocketful he carried.
"No eatlug between meals." be com
mauded. "There's no game in the
country ahead, and the grub will have
to l>e whacked in equal rations from
the start. The only way you can travel
with us is by playing fair "
By 1 o'clock the crust bad thawed
so that the skis broke through, and
before 2 o'clock tbe web shoes were
breaking through. Camp was made
and tbe first meal eaten. Smoke took
stock of the food MeCan's supply
was a disappointment. So many silver
fox skins had lie stuffed into the bot
tom of the meat bag that there was lit
tie space left for meat.
Enough food for a month, with care
ful husbanding and appetites that nev
er blunted their edge, was Smoke's
and Lnbiskwee's judgment. Smoke ap
portioned the weight and- bulk of the
packs, yielding in the end to La bisk
wee's Insistence that she. too. should
carry a pack.
Next day the stream shallowed out in
a wide mountain valley, and they were
airendy breaking through the crust on
the flats when they gained the harder
snrfaee of the slope of the divide.
"Ten minutes later, and we wouldn't
have got across tbe flats," Smoke said
when they paused for breath on the
bald crest of the summit. "We must
be a thousand feet higher here."
But Labiskwee. without Speaking,
pointed down to an open flat amoug
the trees. In the midst of It, scattered
abreast, were five dark specks that
scarcely moved.
"The young men," said Labiskwee.
"They are wallowing to .their hips,"
Smoke said "They will never gain the
hard footing this day. We', have hours
the start of them. Come <on, McCan.
Buck up. We don't eat till we can't
travel."
In the higher valley in which they
now fouud themselves tbfe crust did
not break till 3 in the afternoon, at
which time they managed'to gain the
shadow of a mountain where the crust
was already freezing again
Black darkness came ou.fifter a long
twilight at 9 o'clock. wbe% they made
camp in a clump of dwarf iprnce. Mc
Can was helpless. The (Jay's march
had been exhausting, but is addition,
despite his nine years' experience In
the arctic, he had been rating snow
aud was in agony with his parched and
burning mouth. He crouched by the
fire and groaued while they made the
camp. ■- ' '.*> *
In the night came wind*.and snow,
and through the day of tdizzard they
fought their way blindly,(blissing the
turn of the way that led ?np a small
stream aud crossed a dirtde to tbe
west. For two more dayf they, wan
dered. crossing other and Wrong di
vides, and in those two^days they
dropped spring behind andlclimbed up
into the abode of winter. %. '
"The young men have lost our trail,
an' what's to stop us restin' a day?"
McCan begged.
But no rest was accorfljld. Smoke
and Labiskwee knew tlfjiir danger.
They were lost in the bigbgjnountnins,
aud they had seen no game nor signs
of game. Day after day 4hey strug
gled on through an irou configuration
of landscape that compelled them to
labyrinthine canyons and Talleys that
led rarely to the west. The terrible
toil and the cold ate up energy, yet
they rut down the size of the ration
they permitted themselves.;
One night Smoke was awakened by a
sound of struggling. Distinctly* he
heard a gasping aud strangling from
where McCan slept. Kicking v the fire
into flame, by its light he saw Labisk
wee. her hands at the mau'è throat and
forcing from his mouth Â chunk ot
partly chewed meat. Eveji as Smoke
saw this her hand went tomber Jiipaud
flashed with the sheath knHfe in it
"Labiskwee!" Smoke criM, and his
voice was peremptory.
The tolUlpsttfttei * -
"Don't!" he said, coming to her side.
She was shaking with anger, but the
hand, after hesitating a moment longer,
descended reluctantly to the sheath.
McCan sat up, whimpering nnd snarl
ing.
"Where did you get it?" Smoke de
manded.
Feel around his body," Labiskwee
said. _
CHAPTER XXIV.
Like Weary Ghosts In a Dead World.
M 'CAN strove to struggle, but
_ Smoke gripped him cruelly
and searched dim, drawing
forth from under his arm

heat of his body, a strip of caribou
meat A quick exclamation from La
biskwee drew Smoke's attention. She

be caught in Smoke's arms, where she
surrendered heiself, sobbiug with the
futility of her rage.
"Oh. lover, it is not the food!" she
panted "It is you, your life. The
dog! He is eating you, he is eating
you!"
*******
It was a morning stark still, clear
blue above, with white,sun dazzle on
the snow. The way led tip a long wide
slope or crust. They moved like weary
ghosts in a dead world.
"Something is going to happen," La
biskwee whispered. "Don't you feel
it—here, there, everywhere? Every
thing is strange."
"I feel a chill that is not of cold,"
Smoke answered. "Nor is it of hun
ger."
"It is in your head, your heart" she
agreed excitedly. "That is the wav I
feel it," »
A quarter of an hour later they
paused for breath.
"The air is getting thick and heavy,"
said Labiskwee. "It is hard to breathe."
"There be three suns." McCan mut
tered hoarsely, reeling as he clung to
his staff for support
They saw a mock sun on either side
of the real sun.
"There are five," said Labiskwee,
aud as they looked new suns formed
and flashed before their eyes.
"By heaven, the sky is filled with
suns beyant all countin'." McCan cried
in fear.
Which was true, for, look where they
would, half the circle of the sky daz
zled and blazed with new suns form
ing.
McCan yelped sharply with surprise
and pain. "I'm stung!" he cried out.
then yelped again.
Then Labiskwee cried out. and
Smoke felt a pricking stab on his cheek
so cold that it burned like acid.
And then a shot rang out, strangely
muflied. Down the slope were the
young men. standing on their skis,
and one after another they opened
fire.
"Spread out!" Smoke commanded.
"And climb for it! We're almost to
the top.. They're a quarter of a mile
below, and that means a couple of
miles the start of them on the down
going on tile other side."
"Thank the Lord," Smoke panted to
Labiskwee. "all these suns spoil their
aim."
"It shows my father's temper," she
said. "They have orders to kill."
"How strange you talk!" Smoke said.
"Your voice sounds far away."
"Cover your mouth," Labiskwee
cried suddenly. "And don't talk. I
kuow what it is. Cover your mouth
with your sleeve, thus, aud do not
talk."
From the crest, looking back, they
saw the young men stumbling and fall
ing on the upward climb.
"They will never get here," Labisk
wee said. "It is the white death. 1
know it. though I have never seen it.
I have heard the old men talk. Soon
will come a mist unlike any mist or
fog or frost smoke you ever saw. Few
have seen it and lived."
McCan gasped and strangled.
"Keep your mouth covered," Smoke
commanded. McCan had sunk down,
squatting, on hit? skis, his month and
eyes covered by his arms.
"Come on, make a start," Smoke or
dered.
"I can't move," McCan moaned.
"Let him be," Labiskwee muttered
harshly.
But Smoke persisted, dragging the
man to his feet and facing him down
the long slope they must go. Then he
started him with a shove, and McCan.
braking and steering with his staff,
shot into the sheen of diamond dust
aud disappeared.
Smoke looked at Labiskwee, who
smiled, though it was all she could do
to keep from sinking down. He nodded
for her to push off, but she came near
to him, and. side by side, a dozen feet
apart, they flew down through the
stinging thickness of cold fire.
Brake as lie would, Smoke's heavier
body carried him past her, and he
dashed on alone, a long way. at tre
mendous speed, that did not slacken
till he came out ou a level, crusted
plateau. Here he braked till Labisk
wee overtook him. and they went on,
again side by side, with diminishing
speed, which finally ceased. The leth
argy had grown more pronounced. The
wildest effort of will could move them
no more than at a snail's pace. They
passed McCan. again crouched down
on his skis, and Smoke roused him with
his staff in passiug.
"Now we must stop." Labiskwee
whispered painfully, ''or we will die.
We must cover up—so the old men
said."
She did not delay to untie knots, but
began cutting her pack lashings.
Smoke cut his, and, with a last look
at the fiery death mist and tbe mock
ery of suns, they covered themselves
over with the sleeping furs and crouch
ed in each other's arms. They felt a
body stumble over them and fall, then
heard feeble whimpering drowned in a
violent coughing fit and knew it was
McCan who huddled against them as
lie wrapped his robe about him.
Their own lung strangling began, and
they were racked and tom by a dry
cough, spasmodic and uncontrollable.
Smoke noted his temperature rising in
a fever, and Labiskwee suffered simi
larly. Hour after hour the coughing
spells increased in frequency and vio
lence, and not till late afternoon was
the worst reached. After that the
mend came slowly, and between spells
they dozed in exhaustion.
Smoke awoke with lips touching his
lips. He lay partly in Labiskwee's
arms, his head pillowed on her breast.
Her voice was cheerful and usual. The
muffled sound of it had vanished.
"It is day." she said, lifting the edge
of the robes a trifle. "See. oh. my
lover, it is day! We have lived through,
and we no longer cough. Let us look
at the world, though I could stay here
thus forever and always."
"I do not hear McCan," Smoke said.
"And what has become of the young
men that they have not found us?"
He threw back the robes and saw a
normal and solitary sun in the sky. A
gentle breeze was blowing, crisp .with
frost and hinting of warmer days to
come. All the world was natural
again. McCan lay on his back, his un
washed face, swarthy from camp
smoke, frozen hard as marble. The
sight did not affect Labiskwee.
"Lock!" sh ' cried. "A snowbird! It
is a good sign."
There was no evidence of the young
men. Either they had died on the oili
er side of the divide or had turned
back.
There was so little food that they
dared not eat a tithe of what they
needed, aud in the days that followed,
wandering through the lone mountain
land, the sharp sting of life grew blunt
ed. aud the wandering merged half
into a dream. Smoke would become
abruptly conscious to find himself star
ing at the never ending hated snow
peaks, his senseless bubble still ringing
in his ears. And the next he would
know, after seeming centuries, was
that again be was roused to the sound
of his own maunderings. Labiskwee,
too, was light headed most of the time.
Came a day when it turned cold aud
a thick snow, that was not snow, but
frost crystals of the size of grains of
sand, began to fall. For three days
and nights it continued to fall. It was
impossible to travel until it crusted un
der the spring sun, so they lay in their
1 urs aud rested aud ate less because
they rested. So small was the ration
they permitted that it gave no appease
ment to the hunger pang that was
much of the stomach, but more of the
brain. Aud Labiskwee. delirious, mad
defied by the taste of her tiny portion,
sobbing and mumbling, fell upon the
next day's portion and crammed it into
her mouth.
Then it was given to Smoke to see a
wonderful thing. The food between
her teeth roused her to consciousness.
She spat it out and with a great anger
struck herself with her clinched fist on
the offending mouth.
It was given to Smoke to see many
wonderful things in tbe days yet to
come. After the long snowfall came
on a great wind that drove the dry
and tiny frost particles as sand is driv
en in a sandstorm. All through the
night the sand frost drove by. aud in
the full light of a clear and wind
blown day Smoke looked with swim
ming eyes and reeling brain upon what
he took to be the vision of a dream.
Ail about towered great peaks, and
from the tip of every peak, swaying,
undulating, flaring out broadly against
the azure sky, streamed gigantic snow
banners, miles in length, milky and
nebulous, ever waving lights and shad
ows and flashing silver from the sun.
Labiskwee sat up among the furs.
"I dream, Labiskwee," he said.
"Look. Do you, too. dream within my
dream?"
"It is uo dream." she replied. "This
have the old men told me. And after
tliis will blow the warm winds, and
we shall live and win west."
Smoke shot a snowbird, and they
divided it. Once, in a valley where
willows budded standing in tbe snow,
he shot a snowshoe rabbit. Another
time he got a lean white weasel.
"It is summer In the lower valleys,"
said Labiskwee. "Soon will it be sum
mer here."
Tbe days lengthened, aud the snow
began to sink. Each day the crust
thawed, each night it froze again, anil
they were afoot early and late, being
compelled to camp and rest during the
midday hours of thaw when the crust
could not bear their weight. When
Smoke grew snow blind Labiskwee
towed him on a thong tied to her
waist. And when she was so blinded
she was towed by a thong to bis waist.
And, starving, in a deeper dream, they
struggled on through an awakening
land bare of any life save their own.
The time came when Ihe last food
was gone. The high peaks receded,
the divides became lower, and the way
opened promisingly to the west. But
their reserves of strength were gone,
and, without food, the time quickly fol
lowed when they lay down at night
and in the morning did not arise.
Smoke weakly gained his feet, col
lapsed and on hands and knees crawl
ed about the building of a fire. But.
try as she would. Labiskwee sank back
each time in an extremity of weak
ness. And Smoke sank down beside
her. a wan sneer on his face for the
automatism that had made him strug
gle for an unneeded lire. There was
nothing to cook, and the day was
warn* -
CHAPTER XXV.
Wonder of Women.
L ABISKWEE lay in a stupor, her
breathing so imperceptible that
j often Smoke thought her dead.
In the afternoon the chatter
ing of a squirrel aroused him. Drag
ging the heavy rifle, he wallowed
through the crust that had become
slush. He creid ôn hands and knees
or stood upright and felt forward in
the direction of the squirrel that chat
tered its wrath and fled slowly and
tantalizingly before him. He had not
the strength for a quick shot and the
squirrel was never still.
So profound was his weakness that
he lay like dead through tiie night, nor
did dreams disturb him.
The sun was iu the sky. the same
squirrel chattering through tbe trees,
when Labiskwee's hand on Smoke's
cheek awakened him.
"l'ut your hand on my heart, lover."
she said, her voice clear, but faint and
very far away. "My heart is my love,
and you hold it in your hand." A long
time seemed to go by ere she spoke
again. "Remember always there is no
way south. That is well known to the
caribou people. West—that is the way
—and you fire almost there—and yon
will make it."
And Smoke drowsed iu the numbness
;hat is near to death until once more
she aroused him.
"rut your lips oivmine.'' she said. "1
will die so."
"We will die together, sweetheart,"
was his answer.
"No." A feeble flutter of her hand
checked him. and so thin was her voice
that scarcely did he hear it, yet did he
Concluded on Page Four.
A LAND OF MURDERS.
Papua, a Cold Blooded Country, Where
Life Is Held Cheap.
Papua has long been known as a
bloody land. It is a bloody land still.
But the blood of white men Is rarely
let, and the wanton slaughter of na
tives, tbe one by the other—at least
in those fast widening regions which
are withiu the sphere of the law—is
fast diminishing. All this beiug so in
one year, nevertheless, when there
were 215 prisoners committed for trial,
118 of them were charged with murder,
nine with manslaughter and five with
attempted murder.
To the civilized mind the motives to
murder, shocking enough, to lie sure,
nor wanting an aspect of grewsome
humor, are upon occasion incredible.
As they are matters of record, how
ever, disclosed on painstaking investi
gation. they are to bo uccepted, not as
irresponsible tab's, such as wander
about the eastern seas, but ns substan
tial facts, however singular and incom
prehensible they may appear.
It is a matter of court record, for ex
ample, that certain natives of what is
called the coast range, beiug upon trial
for tbe murder of two carriers, whose
throats they had cut. admitted the deed
without the least hesitation and sought
to justify the ghastly business upon
tbe ground that the carrier had appear
ed to be "cold and hungry"—dejected
fellows, far away from their village.
The prisouers had not eaten tbe cur
riers. They had merely—with the most
considerate expedition—cut the throats
of the carriers, who were strangers, at
any rate, aud therefore of no great cou
sequeuce, and no Ingenuity of cross
questioning could elicit a motive ul
terior to the one so ingenuously ad
vanced- that the carriers, appearing to
be "cold and hungry." were, in the
opinion of the gentlemen who had in
continently cut their throats, much bet
ter dead.
A similar case of merciful extermina
tion concerned a young native employ
ed to shoot gajne for a white planter,
who encountered a sick man (Papuan)
on tbe road near a river and stran
gled him to death. Upon trial he ex
plained that the sick man had created
annoyance and a considerable embar
rassment ns well by insistently re
questing to be carried across tbe river
to tlio other side, whence his way lay
forward to his village.
i( "Quite so," said the presiding officer.
M by, then, didn't you carry him
ncross tile river?"
"He was too heavy," replied the na
tive. "It would have put me to a great
deal of trouble."
"Why did you kill him?"
"What else could I do? The man
was sick,"
