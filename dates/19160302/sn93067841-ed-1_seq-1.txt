i PRESIDENT WILSON'S
RINGING ADDRESS.
r.: . I
^ AMERICA SHOULD NEVER SACRIk
FICE HONOR AND JUSTICE
? FOR PEACE, HE SAYS.
r - ,
j President Wilson told members
and guests at a Gridiron Club dinner
Saturday night in Washington that
America ought to keep out of the
ji European war, "at the sacrifice of
everything except this single thing
upon which her character and her
L history are founded, her sense of
humanity and justice."

rue address was coquucuum, aiuw
the speeches at the dinners of the
Giidiron Club, composed of newspaper
correspondents, are not reported.
It was later made public, however.
with the consent of the PresiMfcat
and club, because many of
tbeae who heard it urged that it
should go to the country.
Fhe President spoke of the Najfj
ticn's affairs with unusual gravity.
^ His hearers, including several hundred
members of Congress, Govern1
nwnt officials, business men and corU7.?rp
hrnmrht to their
feet cheering when he concluded
with these words:
TRUE VALOR.
f "I would be just as much ashamed
to be rash as I would to be a coward.
Vtior is self-respecting. Valor is
circumspect. Valor strikes only
| wlec it is right to strike. Valor
t withholds itself from all small imWpl'cations
and entanglements and
[ i waits for the great opportunity
when the sword will flash as if it
carried the light of heaven upon its
blade."
I In his address he said:
I "T I llfflo fn oov f-nnicrht

; except to express my warm appreI
ciation of the invariable courtesy of
this club and of the reception you
have so generously accorded me. I
find that I am seldom tempted to
say anything nowadays unless somebody
starts something and tonight
nobody has started anything.
'' "Your talk, Mr Toastmaster, has
| been a great deal about the candidacy
for the Presidency. It is not
a new feeling on my part, but one
which I entertain with a greater intensity
than formerly, that a man
who seeks the Presidency of the
United States for anything that it
will bring to him is an audacious
fool. The responsibilities of the of<
fice ought to sober a man even bej
fere he approaches it. One of the
; difficulties of the office seldom api.
predated, I dare say, is that it is
B very difficult to think while so many
V people are talking, and particularly
J while so many people are talking in
a way that obscures counsel and is
entirely off the point.
NATIONAL AFFAIRS.
"The point in national affairs,
L gentlemen, never lies along the lines
1 of expediency. It always rests in
Lthe field of principle. The United
Pn^ates was not founded upon any
P principle of expediency, it was found|
ed upon a profound principle of huD
man liberty and of humanity, and
P whenever it bases its policy upon
D any other foundations than those it
B builds on the sand and not upon solid
B rock. It seems to me that the most

enlightening thing a man can do is J
suggested by something which the 2
Vice President said tonight. He j

great spaces of the quiet continent, c
but thought only of some immediate ?
and pressing piece of business. It ?
seems to me that if you do not think ?
of the things that lie beyond and ?
away from and disconnected from ?
this scene in which we attempt to ?
think and conclude you will inevit- ?
ably be led astray. I would a great ?
deal rather know what they are '
talking about around quiet firesides :
all over this country than what they
are talking about in the cloak rooms
of Congress. I would a great deal
rather know what the men on the
trains and by the wayside and in the
shops and on the farms are thinking
about and yearning for than hear 1
any of the vociferous proclamations
of policy which it is so easy to hear
and so easy to read by picking up
any scrap of printed paper. There
is only one way to hear these things,

SIMPLICITY WITH STRENGTH. t
"Senator Harding was saying just j
now that we ought to try when we c
are a hundred million strong to act
in the same simplicity of principle I
that our forefathers acted in when r
we were three million strong. I t
heard somebody say that the present
population of the Union is one hun- \
dred and three millions. If there are t
three millions thinking the same r
things that the original three mil- s
lions thought, the hundred million i
will be saved for an illustrious fu- j
ture. They were ready to stake c
everything fur an ideal, and that >
ideal was not expediency, but \
justice. And the infinite difficulty ! t
of public affairs, gentlemen, is to' 1
square the things you do by the not: t
simple but complicated standards of, t
justice. Justice has nothing to do j i
with any temporary standard what- i
ever. It is rooted and grounded in ! j
the instincts of humanity. j J
"America ought to keep out of l ?
this war. She ought to keep out of 1 s
this war at the sacrifice of every- ' i
thing except this single thing upon ! i
which her character and history are ! ?
founded, her sense of humanity and <
justice. If 3he sacrifices that she \
has ceased to be America, she has 1
ceased to entertain and love the tra-!
ditions whicn have made us proud 1
to be Americans, and when we go ' j
about seeking safety at the expense j
of humanity then I for one will be-1
lieve that I have always been mis-1 (
taken in what I have conceived to I (
be the spirit of American history, j i
DETERMINING THE FUTURE.
i
"You never can tell your direc- (
tion except by long measurements. *
You cannot establish a line by two *
posts; you have got to have three at j
least to know whether they are ]
straight with anything, and the (
longer your line the more certain
your measurement. There is only j
one way in which to determine how (
the future of the United States is; f
going to be projected, and that is by c

The American roll of honor, the
^resident said, consists only of the
lames of men who have 'squared
heir conduct by ideals of duty.'
"And I wish," he added, "that
vhenever an impulse to settle a
hing some short way tempts us we
night close the door and take down
lome old stories of what American
dealists and statesmen did in the
Dast and not let any counsel in that
loes not sound in the authentic
foice of American tradition. Then
ve shall be certain what the lines of
he future are because we shall
cnown we are steemig by the lines
?f the past. We snail know that no
:emporary convenience, no temporary
expediency, will lead us to be
ash or to be cowardly. I would be

Valor strikes only when it is

name is preferable to the postoffice
Hpnsrtmpnt "Odar Swamo" was
rejected and "Benson" accepted as
the name of the new office.
In the course of time Benson postoffice
was discontinued and the patrons
are favored now by a rural
route instead.

have no more postoffice, but have
