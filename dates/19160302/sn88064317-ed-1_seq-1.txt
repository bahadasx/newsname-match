It Always Helps
says Mis. Sylvania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky., In
writing of her experience with Cardui, the woman's
tonic. She says further: "Before 1 began to use
Cardui, my back and head would hurt so bad, 1
thought the pain would kill me. 1 was hardly able
to do ary of my housework. After taking three bottles
of CarduL I began to feel like a new woman. 1 soon
gained 35 pounds, and now, 1 do all my housework,
as well as run a big water mill.
1 wish every suffering woman would give
CARDUI
The Woman's Tonic
a mol I still use Cardui when I feel a little bad,
and it always does me good."
Headache, backache, side ache, nervousness,
tired, worn-out feelings, etc., are sure signs of woman
ly trouble. Signs that you need Cardui, the woman's
tonic. You cannot make a mistake in trying Cardui
for your trouble. It has been helping weak, ailing
women for more than fifty years.
