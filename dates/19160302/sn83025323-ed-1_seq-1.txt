MALTA HOTEL PARTLY
DESTROYED BY FIRE.
One of the Historic Old Landmarks
Of the City Nearly Goes Up
In Smoke.
Shortly after seven o'clock Tues
day evening smoke was discovered
issuing from the roof of the Hotel
Malta and, it was only a short space
of time before the entire east roof
of the structure was ablaze. An
alarm was turned in and the local
fire laddies were promptly on the
scene, but the fire had gained such
headway that it was thought at first
the entire north side of the town
was doomed. After
the water was
turned on it was
not long until the
flames were under
control and what
would have been a
total loss without
the fire fighters
was turned into on
ly a partial loss.
Chas. Henry,who
was operating the
hotel, states that
he cannot under
stand how the fire
could have started,
as there were no
fires during the
day in any of the
stoves in the up
stairs rooms, but
the fire seems to
have originated in
:1hr third story.
The Hotel Malta, or better known t
as the Caselberg hotel, was built
about 26 years ago by Elisha V. C
Tucker for Mrs. Hyatt, now Mrs. I
Arthur Cavanaugh. Mrs. Hyatt ran r
the hotel for a number of years and a
then Mrs. Guinn was the landlady a
for a time, followed by Mrs. Susan
Barrett mother of A. J. Barrett of
Dodson, and who recently died at
her home in Chinook. Several oth- t
ers whose names could not be re- e
called by old timers last evening, 1
had charge of the hostelry at various t
times until fourteen years ago last c
May when Mr. and Mrs. Caselbherg e
arrived from Minnesota and took i
charge of the house.
Under the Caselberg administra
tion various changes were made in
the building and a brick veneer wall
on the front and one side built. It i
Ri.OAl) I)AYLIGHT ROBBERY
AT FIFTH AVENUE HOTEL.
Wednesday noon while Proprie
tor McIlwain of the Fifth Avenue
hotel was eating his dinner, the till
in the main office was broken open
and about $16 in currency and sil
ver taken. A number of checks in
the till were not disturbed. Suspicion
pointed to Bob Raymond,who has
been acting as porter at the hotel for
some time past and as he could not
be found a warrant was sworn out
for him. Later it was learned that
he boarded No. 1 here about noon
and the sheriff's office wired to Chi
nook ,and the train was searched at
that point but Raymond was not
found, but a little later a wire from
Havre stated that he had been ap
prehended in the yards at the gas
city as he was leaving the train
when it slowed down to enter the
yards. It was learned that one of
the brakemen on No. 1 had secreted
the culprit in a closet at Chinook
when the train was searched there
and that was the reason he was not
arrested at the Blaine county capi
tol. Sheriff Shaw went to Havre on
No. 3 last night and will bring Ray
mond back here today for a prelim
inary hearing.
Mr. McIlwain says that Raymond
was one of the best men he ever had
in his employ and was more than
surprised that he would commit a
pettit larceny trick like the above.
He had been employed at the hotel
about a month.
THE LIFI OF OUR SAVIOUR
SEVEN REL MASTERPIEC'I'.
This picture was produced by the
well known Pathe corporation in
France and in the Hol-- Land and
released Dec. 24th. There nave
been many attempts at productions
of the kind but the Pathe company
has succeeded in getting the master
piece of them all. The compilation
of this chronology of Jesus is truly
an achievement worthy of the hioih
est praise as it truthfully portrays
with grace and dignity his suffering
and final achievement.
Aside from being a masterpiecc
in itself, the fact that the entire 7
reels are beautifully hand colored.
an art which only Pathe has mas
tered, makes this production doubly
interesting.
The Orpheum extends an urgent
invitation to the ministers and
church members of Malta to see this
great work. Prices announced later.

The annual meeting of the Mill
River Gun club will be held tomor-
row (Friday) evening, in the otlicl
of Harry Cosner at 8 p. m. Thl
members have all been notified anal
a good attendance is expected.
Joseph Redona played in bMrli
luck last week when he sent his.
hired man to town with a load of
grain. The man came to town all
right and sold the grain, but did not
return with the ramin check. It v.':
't1 nnd since then the fellow hlo
Imade his whereabouts unknown to
Mr. Redona or the officials, who are
looking for him. The grain would
amount to between $40 and $50.
will be noticed that in the fire Tues
day night this wall remained intact
and the fire did not seem to damage
it to any extent.
In its time this historic old land
mark has housed many notables of
the state and nation. It has always
been the headquarters for the var
ious large sheep and cattle men of
the northern part of the state and
nearly all their help was secured by
application through the hotel, and
especially during the management
of the late Phillip Caselberg. After
the death of Mr. Caselberg it was
under the management of Mrs. Cas
elberg and Ellis Blumenthal until
recently when it was leased to Chas.
