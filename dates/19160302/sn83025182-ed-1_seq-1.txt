"If ruch a thing be even oonoetr
able, I do not feel I could withhold

from Stone that tne administration
thinks war might not be undesirable.
Williams Insinuated that "foolish
politicians" were responsible for the.
president's difficulties.
"Americans wimout frills, embroid
eries or hyphens have a right to live
here and be heard," said Williams
ironically, "pleading for Americanism
In the present dispute.
"Bring on your Gore resolution or
any other resolutions and table them.
Let us see whether senators stand
against the president on a principle
of international law 600 years old.
'ine international law is plain," con
tinued Williams, "and Germany
wishes to change it and make us a
party to the crime. For us to recog
nise Germany's claim would be an
unneutral act. The only danger of
war isn't the effort to prevent the
president from carrying on negotia
tions. It is your action and yours
alone that induced the last position
taken by Germany."
Denouncing all American sympa
thizers with European belligerents.
Senator Gore nswered: "I believe the
holders of a half billion of the allies
bonds would like to have us Insure
their cause," he said. "Our whole
welfare should not be placed in the
hands of any one madcap American
who might ship on an armed mer
chantman.
"It is a right that is a survival of
piracy, but civilization abrogates
brutal rights," Gore continued. Slav
ery was once a legal right. Every
madcap American citizen has a legal
right to risk his own life and engult
his nation in bloodshed. Every Amer
ican has a right to be protected
against becoming involved in this
butchery.
"My only contention is that pending
this struggle, the legal rights should
be withdrawn. We ought to say, as
we would to a son or daughter, 'Don't
you go on an armed ship.'
"Your resolution doesn't withdraw
the right of any American to travel
does it?" asked Clapp.
"No, it urges Americans not to
exercise it," answered Gore.
