Tki Pkilippius mi Their Destiny.
Greensboro New j
If there is any one thing on
which the people of the United
States are of one mind it is their
absolute certainty that they do
not want the Philipine islands as
a permanent investment. Every
body says we must turn them
loose as soon as there is any pos
sibility of their taking care of
themselves. The senate has pass
ed a resolution setting four years
as, the time limit, and forthwith
numerous and vociferous critics
began "roundly denouncing the
senate.
We find it rather difficult to
follow the logic of the critics. It
may be the senate was thinking
more of.a'campaign pledge than
of the Filipinos when it passed
the measure, but at that it was
a good campaign pledge. It may
be that something may happen
within the next four years to
prevent the carrying out ot the
plan, but in such a case the worst
charge that could be brought a
gainst the senate would be that
of passing a useless bill as char
ges go, a light one. It has been
said that the senate ought not
raise the Filipinos' hopes only to
dash them. But this senate means
' what it says; if another senate
reverses this one, that is not the
fault af a dead-and-gone.
We, for one, a re getting exceed
ingly weary of endless reitera
tion of this country's "duty" to
. ward the Filipinos. Unfortunate
ly we did butt in on the destiny
of the islands, and destroy their
governmental system as then es
tablished. Therefore we clearly
owed it to them to set up a sub
stitute system as good as the
one we had knocked down; be
yond that we cannot see where
.this government has any duty
toward, or owes any obligation
. to the h ilipinos. We have set up
a system of government certain
ly not inferior to Spanish tyranny.-Our
duty is done. Then for
heaven's sake let us get out. If
the senate is to be criticised it i
fof. making the term four years
instead of four months.
. We have no illusion about tin
Filipino's fitness for self-government.
Unless Uncle Sara stands
over the islands with a bayonet,
within five years after the Stars
and Stripes are hauled down
from over Manilla bay, the Ris
ing Suu will go up. Butyou can't
learn to swim withoutgoingnear
the .water. You can't learn to
govern yourself without tryiog
If we let the Philippines go there
is hope that within four or five
centuries they may learn the art
of seh-government. True, it took
the "Anglo-Saxon more than a
thousand years to acquire that
working knowledge of the sub
ject that he has now, but the Fil
ipino will have the advantage of
better instruction.
The world is pretty generally
generally agreed that George
Pewy might have sailed all the
Seven Seas and looked in vain
for a more utterly useless mess
of junk to wish on his beloved
country. The sand bars dignifie
" byjthe name of islands are ex
ceedingly barren, exceedingly un
healthy in most cases, and ex
tremely hot in all. Moreover they
are extremely far from any legit
iraate trade interest of the Uni
ted States and their population
represents the other extreme ol
the human race in its origin and
ideals.
The Yellow Peril may be quite
" as perilous as California ining-
ines, but all the same we could
see the Japanese flag flying over
the Philppines without any loss
of sleep. In fact, we could view
with perfect equanimity a prop
osition to hand the islands to
- the Mikado with fifty cents in
money, . 'v' '. '

We have heard much of th
President's tour of the country
in the interest of his prepared
ness program. But little has
been said about the triD made
by the President's wife at the
Bametirae. Mrs. Wilson toured
the county als-s and those who
were with them say that she re.
ceived quite as much attention
and applause as her husband. It
asher first trip since she be
came the mistress of the White
House and the people were even
more eager to see her than they
were to hear the President. News
paper men who accompanied the
couple are yet in doubt as to
which made the better impress
ion with the masses, the Presi
dent or the President's wife.
Samuel M. Williams, the star
political reporter of the New
York Evening World, who ac
companied the President on this
tour, tells the Editor and pub
lisher that, in the eye' of many
thousands of w men of the West,
and nearly as many men. the
most important person was Mrs.
Wilson. He says that seldom
indeed, has it fallen to the lot of
a lady to have showered upon
her such adulation, such compli
ment, such approval, even from
her own critical sex, as was dis
played in the surging, applaud
ing, curious crowds that greeted
her in every city. Answering the
question, "How did she conduct
herself?" which he is sure every
woman who was not present at
the meetings is asking, Mr. Will
iams says:
"My personal opinion, being
that of a mere mau, is that she
made a tremendous hit with all
classes. When you give a pretty
woman a wonderful smile that
simply disarms and captivates
at a glance, who is there that
can withstand her charms? Then
when you add cleverness in man
ner, poise in public and stuning
costumes what is there left of
compliment to bestow on the
new mistress of the White House?
"At every public meeting Mrs.
Wilson was beside the President
on the platform, sitting quietly,
modestly, refraining from even a
whispered woJ while he was
speaking, never applauding and
apparently unconscious of the
attention she was dividing with
her husband. As the tour reach
ed regions west of the Mississippi
where the people are more friend
ly and demonstrative than in the
Last, they clamored insistent de
mands for the lady of the White
House to apiear on the rear plat
form of the train, or in the bal
conies of city hotels, so that the
waiting throngs could see her
and cheer her. They cried com
pliments to her beauty, some
times crudely but so honest as to
bring the flush of unalloyed ioy
to Jier cheeks. What bride could
have a more wonderous wedding
journey?" '

In a center piece on the first
page of The Commoner for Feb
ruary, Colonel Bryan makes a
statement in which he sets forth
that the differences between him
self and President Wilson are not
personal. "For the benefit of
those who seem unable to under
stand disagreements about prin
ciple," he says, "I venture to
bring down to date the personal
relations between the President
and myself. The letters that
passed between us at the time of
my resignition ought to be ac
cepted by friend of both as suffi
cient proof that there were no
personal differences' between us
at that time. No personal differ
ences have arisen since. The
President is doing his duty as he
sees it. Acting under the respon
sibility of a citizen and under a
sense of obligation to those who
have trusted me I am doing mv
duty as I see it. Iam opposing
the plan to increase the appro
priations for the Army and Navy,
just as I would expect the Presi-
denttodo if our positions were
reversed and he looked upon the
subject as I do." Tfoat certainly
reads fair, but in the leading edi
torial page we find Colonel Bryan
araigning Wilson for seeking his
counsel from corrupt sources
and not from the "masses." Col.
Bryan charges that the President
did not consult the Senators and
Representatives in Congress, nor
did he consult the people, but
that his only sources of informa
tion were "a metropolitan press.
subserviant to big business; and
navy leagues, defense leagues and
security leagues officered by rep
resentatives of big business." Is
Col. Bryan sure that President
Wilson relied on these sources foi
his information? If he did,' then
he is a venal man and the differ
ences between himself and Col.
Bryan must be far more than
merely personal. The disclaimer
and the arraignment do not bar
monize. Facing one way, Col.
Bryan calls Wilson his beloved
personal friend, facing about he
holds him up to the people of the
country as a man who has be
trayed their interests to the
"Mercenary friends who flock a-
round him." It would have been
in better taste if the center piece
of The Commoner had been omit
ted. Mtthosilah.
Methuselah, that grand old
gent, saw centuries pass by; the
generations came and went, and
he refused to die. No doubt a
mong the ancient ranks the fad
dists drew their breath, and he
was told byjiealth board cranks
ust how to sidestep death. 1
seem to see them at his side, and
hear them give advice. "Eat
predigested hay," they cried,
"that has been kept on ice. Sleep
out of doors, in rain or gale, or
you'll be on the blink; boil all the
air that you inhale, and fry the
things you drink. Eat less than
half of what you wish, put saw
dust in your bread; if you are
ond of beef or fish, eat liverwurst
Instead." The faddists sprung
their spiels and died; Methuselah
shed tears, but would not take
them as a guide and lived nine
hundred years. His voice across
the distance calls acheeringword
to me: "I ate ice cream and
codfish balls, and was from sick
ness free. I filled myself with
scrambled eggs, and steaks from
slaughtered steers, and pranced
aronnd on active legs for near a
thousand years Walt Mason in

The subject of this sketch was
born in Caldwell county, North
Carolina, on April the 6th, 1837,
and was at the time of his death
87 years, 10 months and 9 days
old. He married a Miss Brad
ford, and from the union were
born three children, one son and
two daughters. The eldest dau
ghter married Mr. A. J. Shull,
now residing on Middle Fork, the
other daughter marrying Mr.
Todd Montgomery, of Lenoir.
The son, Mr. Robert Harstin,
lives in Washington, D. C.
Mr. Harstin served 4 years in
the Confederate army. He had
lived in this county for a num
ber of yeais, and was well known
and esteemed in the communi
ties in which he lived. He was ev-
er ready to lend a helping hand
to those in distress; ever ready
to speak a kind word to all and
to cheer the unfortunate. He was
a member of the M. E. Church,
having loined in his youth and
remained in lull fellowship until
the time of his death. When the
end came he was living with his
daughter, Mrs. A. J. Shull. He
had been in feeble health for some
time but almost at once he gave
way and only lived a few day's.
Brother Harstin seemed tu
have a fore-knowledge of h i s
'feath, as he said he would only
live a short time, giving instruc
tions concerning his bural, ex
pressing his readiness and wil
lingness to depart ond be at
rest with his compannns who
had preceded him to the glory
land.
J ust before he breathed his last
be called his daughter to his bed
side, and when asked what he
wanted, whispered, higher, home,
and within a short time he was
gone. Yes, gone where death nev
er comes; where no more storm
clouds rise dark o'er the way.
Then why should children and
friends mourn his departure, for
he has gone to live in a howe
not made with hands eternal
in
the heavens.

Second Letter From Mrs. Stone to Mr.
Savage Regarding Spreads.
"I am so sorry but I simply
cannot take a single spread now.
I am just loaded down and the
women writing me every day to
take more. 1 cannot make the
spreads sell, of coursrj they are
expensive and only a few want
to or rather can afford to buy
them. We do not sell one in a
day, and yet I get fifteen totwen
ty letters a day begging me to
take some. One woman offers me
twelve. I do not want any more
now .jl must have nearly one h u n-
d.ed here and I intend to sell ofi
what I have before getting any
more unless I want something
special when 1 will send for it. I
never have had any spreads
with lace. They sell just as well
with fringe as without. That
does not make so much differ,
ence as the way the work is done
and the neatness of it. Please
tell them all 1 do not want any
more spreads just now, but will
take them as soon as I can."

The Democrat is good and true,
A cleaner sheet don t come to

It stands for truth and all that's
right.
You'll find it thus both day and
night.
The Editor does all he can,
To make his neighbors better
men,
While in some cases he may fail,
You never hear him raise a wail.
The most of men who's work ing
nara,
To bless the world and serve the
Lord,
Will sometimes get what we call
"blues,"
Which tears their socks and rends
their shoes.
And then they'll raise a hue and
cry,
And make you think thev're
going to die.
Unless you knew it was not so,

All of this, and more too,
The Democrat explains to you,
In ways so simple, I can't see,
Why a "Croaker" there should be.

To kingsand queens, whose heads

To bear the news of this good

And tell the world for truth to

ft Deieted Christian Lady Deal
The writer of this sketch
re
ceived a letter from Mrs. Walter
Hayes, of ot. John Washington,
bearing the sad intelligence of
the death of Mrs. Lizzie Haga-
man, ol that section which oc
curred on Feb. 15.
Mrs. Hagaman's maiden name
was Miss Lizzie Crocker, who was
born and reared in Lincoln coun
ty, N. C. She was married to Mr.
lames R. Hagaman, of Watau
ga county, about thirty five years
ago. 'ihey located near Vilas, in
this couuty, where they made
their home for quite a long time.
Later they moved to Tacoma
City, Washington, but did not
remain there long until they re
turned to North Carolina; then
some fifteen years ago they went
west again, settling near St.
John, Washington, where they
have since mad their home.
Sister Hagaman was a devoted
christian lady, with a lovable
and genial disposition, always
extending a heart of sympathy
and a hand of kindness to those
in distress. Her many friends al
ways met with a hearty welcome
at her home. !
The news ol her death will cause
much sorrow among her many
relatives and friends throughout
Western North Carolina, as her
many sterling traits of charac
ter and lovely disposition en
deared her to the heart of all who
knew her. She will bo sadly miss
ed in her newly adopted com
munity, as she was a tirelese
christian worker, and her pli.ee
in the church and Sunday school
will be hard indeed to fill. She
was a member of Brushy Fork
Baptist church while she remain
ed in Watauga.
She leaves a devoted husbana
and four daughters, Lucy, Bes
sie, Uattie and Taenia, togeth
er with a large circle of friends
to mourn their loss.
We extend to Brother Haga
man and the four daughters our
deepest sympathy in their great
bereavement, and would point
them to -our Heavenly Fathei
who doeth all things well, and
has a balm for every brokeii
heart.
