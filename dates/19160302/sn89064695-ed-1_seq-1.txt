Earth, Minn., as mail matter of the at least as Chippewa matters are
concerned.
Since Daniels has been in this
SUBSCRIPTION: S1.50 PER YEA III IDVANCl state prosecuting the land cases of
this reservation, he has shown
himself to be a decided failure,
and, therefore, no one should take
issue with his retirement from the
government service.
With a big blast of horns and
the expenditure of a large amount
of Chippewa tribal funds, Indian
Inspector Linnen and Special In
dian Agent Moorhead spent near
ly the whole of one summer upon
this reservation investigating 0
through ignorant members of this
reservation, who were easily in
duced to sign false affidavits re
garding which to this day they do
not know the contents of, the land
sales upon this reservation The
contentions of these two officials
were eagerly snapped up by M.
Burch, who is now making his liv
ing on a farm near Detroit, Mich.,
and he inaugurated many suits for
the purpose of prolonging his era
ployment and the employment of
many of his relatives and personal
fiiends who made up his force.
The election of a Democratic presi
dent expedited Burch's removal as
The Chippewas of Minnesota
owe much to Senator Clapp and
they fully appreciate this, and
their expressed sentiments indicate
that they will stand by him to a
man at the next election, not only
for his past services in their be
half but on account of his work in
their behalf now.
Over one million five hundred
thousand dollars will be paid to
the Chippewas of Minnesota this
year through the efforts of Senator
Clapp, and one of the -assistant
commissioners of Indian affairs
did not hesitate to say to the Chip
pewa delegation now at Washing
ton that they owed much to Sena
tor Clapo.
In view of the work Senator
Clapp has done for the Chippewas,
always at their suggestion, the
Twin City press cannot prejudice
them against him, neither do we
believe will these efforts have any
aect upon*hte public at large.
The St. Paul Pioneer Press and
Dispatch are to all intents and
purposes one paper, and recently
the Pioneer Press, in an editorial,
referred to the work of Daniels in
unenviable terms, but last week
Monday the Dispatch, in an edi
torial, in substance refutes what
the Pioneer Press recently stated,
no doubt for the purpose of find
ing fault with the work of Senator
Clapp for political reasons.
The business men of Becker and
Mahnomen counties now have a
business representative at Wash
ington in the person of J. T. Van
Metre, and it is to him they should
apply to learn whether he is get
ting from Senator Clapp the aswho
sistance they are hoping will re
suit in straightening out the titles
to lands upon this reservation.
The Indian delegations now atcases
Washington report that Mr. Van
Metre is not only doing all in his
power to obtain results but hasington,
the hearty co-operation of Senator
Clapp.
There has been much ado about
the so called Clapp Act, and insuits
terested office holders have refer
red to it as being a great wrong to
the Indians.
The Clapp Act was passed at the
solicitation of the members of this
reservation, a large number of
whom made agreements more than
a year before it passed with other
members of the reservation that if
they would go to Washington and
urge the passage of the bill, each
one would pay fifty dollars. TIIH
agreement has never been fulfilled
so far as tne payments that were
promised are concerned.
When the bill was pending in matters to the Chippewas in gen
Congress Commissioner of Indian eral to look after than the Iegisla
Affairs Leupp sanctioned it,
andtion
said to the publisher of TH E
that it was merely an
experiment. This experiment his

Daniels' Last Wail.
It is hoped that C. C. Daniels'
last wail has been heard, and that
he has been laid on the shelf,
wae re he belongs, for good so far
it did not take long for Attorney
General McReynolds, now one of
the Justices' of tone-Supreme Court"
of the United States, to discover
Burch's coarse work, and C, C.
Daniels was appointed to succeed
him.
The only thing that can be said
of Daniels is that he proved to be
a total failure as an attorney, and
it is no doubt because of his ignor
ance of the law that has been
largely responsible for his remov
al from the position he held, and
also, probably, his interference
with tribal affairs which were out
side of his duties as an official of
the Department of Justice.
In his letter of refusal to serve
under Mr. Kearful, Daniels un
hesitatingly criticised the former
has the reputation of being a
good attorney, and who, according
to Daniels, refuses to follow the
latter's plans of handling land
upon this reservation.
In view of Daniels' efforts to
prevent any legislation at Wash
according to the informa
tion obtained by the Chippewa
delegation now in Washington,
which might aid to expedite the
of this reservation, it would
be interesting to know how he
would explain his present criti
cisms against those who really
wish to expedite the settlement of
these land cases
When the White Earth delega
tion arrived at Washington Dan
iels lost no time in rushing around
among members of Congress and
making arguments against the leg
islation referred to, neither did he
hesitate to t-y and black list the
members of the delegation The
delegation had more important
which Daniels referred to,
and its members were surprised to
hear of his activities.

That the government will not

FRANK A. DAY PUBLISHES
LETTER ON CHARGES.
OPEN
Frank A. Day, in the Fairmont
Sentinel, has addressed an open
letter to C. C. Daniels, former at
torney in the Chippewa land cases,
demanding that he prove charges
he has made that United States
Senator Moses E. Clapp, E. E.
Smith, F. B. Lynch, Simon Mieh
elct "and other Minnesotans have
conspired to defraud the White
Earth Indians of their lands for
the benefit of certain large lumber
companies," or that he tender an
apology.St. Paul Dispatch.
Examination of the diameter
and texture of the hair is one of
Jie means for aiding the anthrop
ologist to determine whether an
Indian is a full or a mixed-blood,
Dr. A. E Jenks told the State
University students recently. An
other aid in arriving at a conces
sion regarding the status of an In
divid :al is to examine the back of
the upper incisors which in the
white mm are shovel shaped and
in the Indian, concave. Doctor
Jenks spoke on the "Minnesota
Indian tangle" and outlined the
work of the anthropologist in es
tablishing the status of the Indians
of the White Earth reservation.

on the ground that the sales wert
illegal as having been made bv
full-bloods. Then began a long
litigation tofixthe status of many
of the Indians.
Mixed-bloods were defined by
the supreme court to mean any
"detectable trace of white blood,"
and Doctor Jenks stated that
where the allottee was less than
one eighth white, it was impossible
to determine his status by hit
physical appearance alone. Noth
ing definite nor satisfactory could
gained from the testimony of
the Indians themselves, he said, so
resort was made to anthropometric
measurements. Doctor Jenks has
th
study.
Of nine cases settled, eight were
duced by Doctor Jenks' method!?
and he expressed the hope that a
commission would be appointed to
hear the evidence and decide other
cases so as to remove them from
some of the legal obstacles of

Daniels Dies Hard.
C. Daniels, brother of the
SECRETARY OF THE NAVY,
adding to his reputation as an
incompetent, a mark which the
actions of Attorney General Greg
ory placed upon him by removing
from the position of prosecu
tor in chief of the land suits of
this reservation, by charging
prominent public men and lumber
companies wiJi ing instrumental
in his removal from the service.

According to information, then
is absolutely no foundation to Mr
Daniels' statement thit lumbal
companies had anything to do with
his removal, for it was to their in
terest to have as poor a lawyer as
he is to represent the governmeni
and the Indians in the land suit
of this reservation.
The truth of the matter is thai
Daniels devoted too much time to
interfering with Chippewa tribal
matters and not enough to his
duties as an attorney in the land
suits, and the investigation which
followed a petition to the Presi
dent from members of the local
and general councils of the Chip
pewas of Minnesota disclosed this
And this petition was not insiigat
ed by lumber companies either as
Mr. Daniels would lead the public
to believe, but originated here
after his P'ue Point council with
warehous*1rs
on the 4th of July
last.
It is not believed either that F.
B. Lynch, E. E. Smith and Simon
Michelet cared a rap whether Dan
iels remained in the service or not,
altho Mr. Lynch might have fav
ored his removal in order to give
one of his supporters a position.
Mr. Daniels has resorted to all
kinds of raw schemes to retain the
position he held in the government
service, and has been insincere and
untruthful in trying to do this.
For instance, la?t fall he informed
a prominent Republican at Minne
apolis that (x Gov. Eberhart, E.
E. Smith and Simon Michelet
were in league together to specu
late in lands upon this reserva
tion, and that he was going to re
port this to Sen. Clapp

Now he is criticising the latt
for doing his iut. to -om ot his
constituents who requested him to
file a petition with the Presidenr.
The petition was against hnn
ind Supt. Howard arid simply
asked that an investigation of the
acts of these two officials be made,
und the inspectors who made these
investigations leported at'ait.bt
both of them.
As a result Daniels was removed,
or at least this was to some extent
the reason for his lemoval, but
Howard still holds his portion
much to the discredit of the In
dian office.
C. C. Daniels' most successful
efforts since he has been in this
state has been to stir ui strife- at.d
turmoil not only among the Chip
pewas but also in the partv to
which he belongs, and anyone who
pays the slightest attention to his
nntings will gain neither informa
tion nor prestige.
