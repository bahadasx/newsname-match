In Ins foreign policy, the President.;
Mr. Glynn said, was following the ex
ample of lasliitlKton. John Adams.
.Icfferson. Lincoln anil Grant.
'The l'resident," he declared, "has
only shaken .his tinner: when lie has to
shake his list the world will find it
mailed."
"Tlie efforts of politicians, like Mr.
Koot. to make capital out of the course
Mr. Wilson deems it wise for thi> na
tion to follow in respect to P.elgiuni
durine the early stages of the present
war. deserve, ami will receive. tin<|tiali- j
fiod condemnation and rebuke at tin
hands of the most right-thinking and
patriotic American.
"No fair-minded man can question;
the wisdom and integrity of our Uel
gian policy."
Former Governor Glynn declared that,
Mr. Hooi himself, as Secretary 'if State,
adopted the same policy in handling the
Japanese-Korean situation, despite the
protests of Korea against the domi
nation of Japan, and despite, n tre-ity
between Korea and the Pnite.il Mates.
"When Mr. Hoot made his speech his
former instructor and leader was on
the Atlantic Ocean." continued Mr.
Glynn. "This probably enabled Mr.
Hoot to steal Mr. Hooseve.lt's clothes
while he was in swimming and run
away with them. Mr. Uoosevelt is now
condemning President Wilson's llclgiaii
policy, but only a few months an" '??
praised it. When would Mr. floosevi It
have the nation take him serious.y,
now or some months ago?

No compromise proposition, such
a vote of confidence in the President's
? foreign policy, will he acceptable.
I Such an action, it is held, might bo

opinion that the President lacks tin
: .support of Congress and his own party
? in his demands for :i full observance of
| international law. while its only pur
I po.se would he to afford members of
? i.'onarcss a wax to avoid recording their
: positions before the countrx on the
I straight out-and-out question
President Wilson made his position
i clear lo congressional leaders to-night
in unequivocal terms, a.s the climax to
i a day of confusion, uncertainty and
I political maneuvering that marked thu
' opening of his first real tight with
Congress.
) Administration .leaders emphasize
' that the President absolutely refuses
'to continue the negotiations with tier
many unless he is to have a free hand,
ami that he does not consider the latert
I assurances from fount von llcrnstorff,
the fJcrman ambassador, as broad or *>s
1 satisfactory a.s those originally given.
(No further steps will he taken, how
ever. while the President waits on

\\ lllll.K SITl ATIOX
TIIIIOWN INTO SXARIi
Tlic whole situation in CongrcM,
confused l>> i he ('resident's call yester
day for si vote, was thrown into a
snarl to-day when at an early morning
conference the President outlined his
position t<> Chairmen Stone and Flood,
of tin- Foreign Affairs Committees;
Speaker Clark. House l.eader Kitchi-ti
and Acting Chairman Coti, of the House
Itulcs Committee.
As soon as the delegation returned
to the Capitol with news of what the
('resident had said, it was apparent
that sonic* of the leaders who had
secretly supported the a Tit la >1 mini.it ra
tion forces and who had pocketed reso
lutions in committee when there was
danger of their being passed, realized
that the President and his friends had
suddenly gained the whip hand. It
was plain that they sit once devoted
theii efforts to attempts to avoid a
defeat at the hands of the administra
tion forces by sidetracking the main
issue and making the light turn to a.
vote on a resolution of confidence for
the 1'resident. itt which they could join
without compromising their position 111
support of warnini; Americans to avoid
l>cllig* lent aimed ships.
Kiiciids of the. President, watching
the maneuvering closely, saw the ob
ject. and to-niglit from the White
House came the word that there should
? he no compromise. Congress will meet
to-morrow facing .1 clear-cut issue with
t lie 1 'result-in

The President's friends openly chnrg'O
tint resistance 10 his program is purely
political, aiol mi; he does not uilend
to let it be pushed over l>y a conipro
111i.se and risk,being embarrassed later
in bis m not iations with (iermany by
having the agitation come up again to
weaken his hand They point out that
tic extent of the opposition the Presi
dent faces m;ij be judged from tli-i
fai l that chairmen of the Foreign Af
fairs Committees in both branches ot*
Congress, and even Speaker Clark. wer?*
lukewarm in their support of him
The administration's whips in iheir
canvass satisiled themselves that a
majnritv of Th> rank and tile of the
I>enio'-rats an.l many of the Republi
cans will stand by tlie President if
they e..n succeed In forcing !he <iu-5x
tion past trie opposition lenders who
coutiol the inachinery. and to the point
of a vote.
The whole effect of the day's devel
opments was to remove doubt about
the President's position The leaders
went away from the White House un
derstanding fully what ho wanted, but
it was made clear soon afterward that
their attitude was one of resentment
against executive interference. and
some members of the opposition party
strongly advocated prevention of con
grciislonnl action of any kind.
One member of the. Foreign Affairs
Committee predicted that no resolu
tion would be leported from that com
mittee < uh- rn advanced the idea of
