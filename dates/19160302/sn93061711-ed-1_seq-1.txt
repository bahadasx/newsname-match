. SMITH OF
1 hnvo received several inquiries '
this winter about the Green Hug or
grain aphis which is infesting the
wheat in tho Houthern part of this
county. In order to nccure authentic
information about thin insect and the
the means to combat it, I secured
.specimens of tho aphis from Mr. W.
J. Gragg of Ragland, N. M., and sent
them to L)r. D. E. Merrill, Entomol
ogist, at tho State Experiment Sta
tion, near Las Cruccs.
Mr. Merrill has tho following to say
about this insect:
"At this time of the year tho aphis
is npt to bo injurious in localized spots
and plowing; is tho surest method of
killing them out. Sometimes a se
vere discing will do ns well. On lim
ited areas tho application of a spray
of black leaf -10 and soap would kill
them out. I can not say as to tho
expense for spraying a largo ncrcago
with thiH, whether It would pny. A
practice that gives good results In
most cases is to pasture the grain In
fnll nnd winter. Most of tho bugs arc
either entcn up or tramped in. Enrly
sowing is better for this. Later sow
ing is npt to be more free in fall if
there is enough of the early to capture
the majority of tho individuals before
tho later sowing comes on. On the
other hand the late sowing is apt to
suffer most in spring if tho infesta
tion docs not come until then, for it
will bo more succulent.
"Ono essential in the culturnl con
trol of tho aphis is to bo sure the
fields aro clean and free of volunteer
growth in the Ileitis or of grass weeds
that may harbor them, etc., about the
borders. The volunteer growth serves
as a reservoir to hold tho aphides un
til the crop is planted. So plow such
under and bo suro it is entirely rid
of before sowing tho crop. In many
cases this will keep n fall sowing
free."
Sinco very few of tho wheat fields
in the southern part of the county arc
freo from this aphis this spring and
since you have a wide circulation In
that section, I am sending you this
in case you wish to print what Mr.
Merrill says, for the benefit of your
farmer subscribers.
I am also enclosing a clipping from
tho Snnta Fo R. R.'s publication "Tho
Earth" which gives a part of tho re
port of Mr. A. C. Cooley to tho Now
Mexico Farmers' congress. A coun
ty agent, is, au perhaps you already
know, a man hired jointly by tho coun
ty in which ho works nnd by tho U.
S. Dept. of Agriculture nnd by tho
Stnto College. His work consists In
tho main part of collecting nnd dis
seminating information which would
bo of interest nnd profit to farmers.
It is as follows:
"Two hundred nnd forty thousand
dollars worth of farm products wore
sold last year through tho county
agents of Now Mexico.
This is only one of tho items from
a report made to tho Now Mexico
Farmers' Congress by A. C. Cooloy,
director of tho extension division. It
is only about a yenr sinco tho work
began, nnd it is only tho counties of
Lunn, Snn Miguel, Colfax, Chaves,
Dona Ana, Eddy, and Torrance that
have had county agriculturists and
of theBo only for a year, but tho re
sults already accomplished aro mar
velous, although, as Mr. Cooloy says,
tho county agents nro not cure-alls for
all tho ills that afflict each county.
During tho pnst yenr 8,911 farmers
were visited 0,709 letters wore writ
ton, 2,00T office calls were made, 2,933
telephono calls answered, 085 meet
ings held with an attendance of 35,
808, miles traveled by auto 71,035,
miles traveled by other convoynnce
50,000, womon's clubs organized 12,
members 210, boys' and girls' clubs
organized 71, members 795, bulletins
distributed 18,000.
Hut listen I there wns more than
that. The county agents helped to
plan and improve 44 farm buildings,
constructed 38 silos, installed 5 gas
engines, repaired 7 gas cngiiics, plan
ned 4 drainage systems, aided 35 irri
gation systems, assisted in leveling
and clearing 15 farms: helped to so
lect tho seed for 70 farms, treated
tho seed for 255 farms, planned 75
crop rotations, chnnged or introduced
428 crops, procured seed for 105 farms
helped 123 farms to make hotter uso
of natural fertilizers, pruned 22 or
chnrds, sprayed 15 orchards, helped
purchase 34 registered bulls, 35 rog
(stored cows, 1,078 other cows, SO reg
istorcd hogs, 23 other hogs, treated
5,110 unimnls for blackleg, 294 for
tuberculosis, 1,089 for cholera, 120
for miscellaneous diseases, 105 farms
influenced to feed livestock, 23 farm
tirs induced to keep records nnd many
othor things dono and accomplished
which in themselves hnvo paid each
county manifold for employing a coun
ty agent. In fact, there Is not a coan-

ty in the state that can any longer af
ford to do without one.
"To convert tho peoplo to believe
in New Mexico" is the highest task
that the extension department has sot
Itself through its county agent. It
is strango that such work should be
necessary, but Director Cooley has
found in his travels that the great
majority of farmers in Now Mexico
aro dissatisfied. "Invariably ymi lind
the farmer willing to sell out for less
than what he. paid for his lauds. Many
thousands of dollars are made nvaila
blcfor commercial club to advertise
the country, to bring in settlors and
buyers of land, but it is well night im
possible to get a cent to holp settlers
and buyers to get along, to mako a
success after they hnvo been brought
to Now Mexico, It seems the rule
that after land has been sold to a new
comer, to abandon him to his fate,
to let him "root hog or die," and most
of them die. We must have home
builders, not speculators."

If n person is educated along tho
dry fnrm methods when he first tu!;oi
up the tusk of making a living in this
country by digging it out of tho soil,
his success will make him satisfied
and when n person is satisfied he be
comes a booster and tho country re
ceives tho benefits.
SOCIALIST SPEAKING
Tho Socialists of Quay county will
open their campaign Saturday, Mar.

of national reputation, will address
tho public at tho opera house botli
afternoon nnd evening.
His remarks will be along tho lino

to have questions asked him in order
that ho might answer snme. The lec

invitation given to the ladies.
REPUBLICANS MEET .MA It. It
Santn Fe, March 1 The Republi
can state central committee will meet
in Santa Fe on Tuesday, .March 14, to
select the date and fi the place of
the first state convention at which
delegates to the Repu' lican National
con"ontion at Chicago will ht chosen.
Tho date for the meeting was de
cided on by Chin man Ralph ('. Ely
and Secretary Jose D. Sena, just bc-
foro Mr. Ely left for Doming yester
day afternoon. The formal call will
be issued by Secretary Sena, proba
bly tomorrow.
Sinco the time that Chairman Ralph
C. Ely got out letters to voter thru-
out the state asking for their viowr
rcgnrding tho governorship, which
was several weeks ago, some of the
machine Republicans have been sug
gesting thnt as Ely wns an avowed
candidate for the Republican nomina
tion for governor he should resign
the chairmanship of tho committee.
However, if Ely cares to retain his
present position he has tho precedent
established by Holm O. Hursum in
1911 to fnll back upon, and it is ex
tremely doubtful if any of tho mn
chino crowd will attcmot at this time
to force him out of the chairmanship.
Whnt Ely's personal attitude in the
matter may be is another question,

GES REMOVE
Washington, D. C, March 1. Ger
many's latost assurances on the con
duct of submarine warfare, presented
Monday by count von Hernstorff to
secretary of ttnto, Lansing, nro not
to broad as tho United SUitos de
sires, but it is indicated no furthor
steps will be taken by this govern
ment until the administration is cer
tain its action will not bo embarrass
ed in congress.
Tho assurances reiterated in tho lot-
est communication aro regarded as not
so complete ns those originally given
as the result of tho Lusitanla nego
tiations and it was indicated that tho
pending Lusitania agreement would
not bo finally accepted as satisfactory
at this time.
House leaders today drafted for con
sideration of tho house a measure pro
posing that congress express its con
fidence in the president's handling of
the armed merchantmen controversy
and recognizo thnt it is not a matter
of legislative but of executive con
cern. This action is contemplated as a re
sult of an announcement Tuesday by
president Wil.Min that American nego
tiations with foreign powers, notably
regarding submarine warfnre, are bo
ing seriously handicapped by tho im
pression which has become prevalent
abroad that the president is without
tho backing of even his own pnrty in
congress.
Ho urged therefore, that the pend
ing resolutions regarding warning all
American citizens from nrmed mer
chantmen be allowed to come to a
vote in order that tho issue might tie
determined. It is said German papers
have printed accounts of tho near
revolt of a faction of tho Democrats
in the house last week, and thnt tho
attitude of official Germany nt once
stiffened.
Indications are now that the con
test in the house between tho admin
istration supportcra and those who
favor u warning to Americans to keep
away from armed merchantmen will
bo very close. All talk of a heavy
majority in favor of tho hitter cle
ment has been disslpntcd.
Regarding submarine warfare, offi
cials were represented as feeling that
if tho German government took the
position thnt it could modify or chnnge
the first assurances at will, there was
nothing to prevent an attempt to
change tho lntcst assurances, and they
do not intend to agree with such pro
cedure. It was said that the next stop would
bo taken ns soon as tho situation in
congress was clarified. Ofllcinls ex
pect the administration will find itself
in n position to continue the negotia
tions within tho next few days.
Chairman Flood of the foreign af
fairs committee sought to bring Dem
ocrats committee sought to bring tho
Democrats in lino on the vote of con
fidence measure, to bo reported out ot
his committee, and also sought inef
fectually to get assurances of Repub
lican co-operation.
The housu foreign affairs committee
irot ready for a mcotiner nt 1 o'clock
at which it was tho plan to canvass
tho situation nnd refor the drafting
0. tho resolution to n subcommittee.
It wns indicnted thnt most of tho Re
publicans would vote against a warn
ing resolution.
Secretary Lansing todny cabled an
inquiry to nmbassodor Gerard at Ror
