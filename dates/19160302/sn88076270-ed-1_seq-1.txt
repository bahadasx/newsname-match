AVOID WAR BUT
PRESERVE HONOR
COUNTRY MUST NOT SACRIFICE
ITS SENSE OF HUMANITY
AND JUSTICE
President Would Rather Hear Fireside
Opinions Than Those of
Congressmen
Washington, Feb. 28.—President
Wilson told members and guests at
a Gridiron club dinner Saturday night
that America ought to keep out of
the European war at the sacrifice of
everything except this single thing
upon which her character and her his
tory are founded, her sense of hu
manity and justice.
The address was confidential, since
the speeches at the dinners of the
Gridiron club, composed of newspa
per correspondents, are not reported.
It was made public last night, how
ever, with the consent of the presi
dent and the club, because many of
those who heard it urged that it
should go to the country.
Spoke With Gravity
The president spoke of the nation's
affairs with unusual gravity. His
hearers, including several hundred
members of congress, government of
ficials, business men and correspond
ents were brought to their feet cheer
ing when he concluded with these
words:
"I would be just as much ashamed
to be rash as I would to be a coward.
Valor is self-respecting. Valor is
circumspect. Valor strikes only when
it is right to strike. Valor withholds
itself from all small implications and
entanglements, and waits for the
great opportunity when the sword will
flash as if it carried the light of
heaven upon its blade."
The address follows:
"I have very little to say tonight,
except to express my warm appre
ciation of the invariable courtesy of
this club, and of the reception you
have so generously accorded me. I
find that I am seldom tempted to say
anything, nowadays- unless somebody
starts something and tonight nobody
has started anything.
"Your talk, Mr. Toastmaster, has
been a great deal about candidacy for
the presidency. It is not a new feel
ing on my part* but one which I en
tertain with a greater intensity than
formerly, that a man who seeks the
presidency of the United States for
any thing that it will bring to him is
an audacious fool. The responsibili
ties of the office ought to sober a
man even if he approaches it. One of
the difficulties of the office seldom,
appreciated, I dare say, is that it is
very difficult to think while so many

Silas Marner T9 Be
Pictured at The Lyric
George Elliot's immortal novel,
Silas Marner, is a classic in English
literature and the Mutual Master
picture, De Luxe Edition, "Silas Mar
ner," produced by Thanhouser, which
will appear at the Lyric theatre, is a
classic in motion picture productions.
Based upon the novel, it follows the
story closely and all the great charac
terization of the original is preserved.
Nearly everyone knows the story
of the poor English weaver, whose
life was blighted early in his youth
by a false accusation made against
him by a supposed friend. How he
was driven from his village by the
taunts and jeers of his former com
panions and rejected by his sweet
heart, who believed him guilty, and
how he lived as a recluse, caring only
for his gold until a child left on his
doorstep becomes the elevating force
in his unhappy life, is familiar to all
of us.
While reading the book we were en
grossed with the incidents that left
their indelible marks upon the char
acter of Silas Marner. Our imagina
tion was stirred by the genius of the
author, and our sympathies stirred by
the vividness of the description, but
the picturization of this great novel
accomplishes far more than it is pos
sible to get by reading it.
The mental anguish of Silas Marner
is visualized in a gripping and artis
tic manner. The miser's love for his
gold is pictured in actuality rather
than in print. What we imagined dur
ing our reading is closely pictured on
the screen. The vital hapepnings and
leading events in the lives of the prin
cipal characters have been adapted
for the screen while the unnecessary
details have been omitted.
Historical Soc.
XXX
Williston Student
Gains Distinction
At the University of Wisconsin
Washington's birthday was celebrated
by the fifth military ball, given by
the University Cadet Corps.
"Surpassing anything previously
given" says The Daily Cardinal, a
university publication, "the ball re
asserted Wisconsin's preeminence in
having the most brilliant military
function of the middle west." A full
description of the splendid appoint
ments and elaborate features of the
ball is given. Appropriate military
form and dignity were regarded to the
fullest degree. "At eleven," says the
account, "tatoo was sounded, the
lights dimmed and the candles in the
boxes lighted during the presentation
of the military feature by the crack
drill squad of the corps under com
mand of Lieutenant Robert D. Mans
field. This spectacle was the result
of two months work by the men, most
of the practice being done after ten
o'clock at night."
The description of the spectacle
shows it to have been both thrilling
and intricate. To have perfected a
crack squad to a point fitting it to be
the central attraction of such an
occasion is high distinction for "Bob"
who is well known in the city as the
son of Mr. and Mrs. Charles A. Mans
field. Local friends congratulate the
lieutenant on the success that his
faithful work at the university, which
is by no means confined to military
drill, is bringing him.
Tom Lennon To Put
On Facing The Music
Tom Lennon dropped in on us one
day this week and informed us that
he had closed his Wolf Show Co., and
was now giving his time to several
amatuer entertainments throughout
the state. He recently put on a big
production at Mohall and will put the
same play on here with local support
on Friday evening, March 17. The
play is under the auspices of the
Catholic church and as it is the first
real play to go on the New Armory
stage it goes without saying that this
..will be one of the biggest theatrical
events ever pulled off in this end of
the state. MrvJ^en^-an' has rendered
Some of the very best kind of enter
tainments during the past ten years
and we feel safe in predicting a rec
ord breaking house at the Armory
on March 17. The name of the play
is Facing The Music, a side splitting
farce comedy and is now being play
ed in the east by Jas. J. Corbett. The
local cast is composed of about twen
ty of the best local talent of Williston
and they are busy getting the play in
shape for St. Patrick's Day.

Will Open Grocery
And Dellicatessen
B. C. Roach for many years a sales
man in the Asbury grocery and a
traveling salesman out of this city
will open a new grocery in the Kas
sis building on east Broadway March
15. Mr. Roach, who is well known to
the people of the community as thor
oughly versed in his line, says his
specialty will be complete and high
grade fancy groceries and an attrac
tive dellicatessen stock.
The Roach Cash Grocery, which
will be the style of the concern will
occupy the west half fthe double
building. O. E. O'Dell, with his new
ladies and children's ready-to-wear
store will occupy the east half in
stead of the old "Hub" stand as first
stated.
BOB RUTLEDGE—CHECKER
PLAYER
Deputy Sheriff R. R. Rutledge is a
man of checkered career but they came
very near not checking him at all
after he got started at the Fargo
checker tournament. Pitted against
19 other North Dakota checker ex
perts he failed of first place by the
narrowest margin possible.
At the end of the regular schedule
of 38 games each, Bob stood tied for

HERD OF ABERDEEN
ANGUS FOUNDED

HEFFERNAN & SON ADD PEDI
GREED ANIMALS OF FAMOUS
STRAIN TO HERD
Will Build Up Pure Bred Herd of the
Famous Black Polls On Ranch
East of City
Steadily and surely the pure bred
stock interests of this section grow in
importance. More and more farms
are becoming the homes of pedigreed
cattle, horses and hogs. The latest
activity noted in this direction is by
Heffernan & Son who have an ambi
tion to be the proprietors of a prize
herd of Aberdeen Angus cattle and
have gone quietly about the work of
laying the best possible foundation.
They already have a number of the
breed of hornless cattle on their
ranch 12 miles east of the city but
will start a new and exclusive herd
with animals recently purchased.
Their belief is that the best is none
too good in starting a work of this
nature.
Among the most noteable animals
secured are two beautiful heifers pur
chased in person by John Heffernan
Sr., while in Ontario last September,
from J. A. McLeod, proprietor of
Highland Home stock farm, one of
the most famous in Canada. Mr. Mc
Leod stands in the front rank of
Canadian stock breeders and held as
high authority, especially on the fa
mous Scotch breed, Aberdeen Angus
Mr. McLeod is president of the Ca
nadian Aberdeen Angus Breeders As
sociation which has charge of all
registrations of that breed. The two
females selected by Mr. Heffernan, by
the personal advice of Mr. McLeod
are registered as Lady Bate of High
land Home II, No. 9287 and—Lady
Bate of Highland Home III, No. 9757.
One is coming two and the other com
ing a year. They are animals of
splendid build with noticeably large
ears and heavy coats of long hair of
silky fineness. These aristocratic
young cows arrived' in Williston in
January:
The sire selected for this new line
vis purchased of M. L. Sullivan, a
well known breeder of Langdon, N
D. It is a splendid animal of purest
breeding, registered as Herbert S of
Langdon.

Changes In Band
Dance Plans and Place
For various unavoidable reasons it
has been decided to cancel all dates
at the armory until it can be com
pleted. Hence the masked ball by
the Williston concert band dated for
Monday night will not be held as ad
vertised but has been changed from
a masked to a ball without costumes
or masks and will be held at Odd Fel
lows hall Monday night, March 6.

Will Crystalize At Weekly
Sessions
With a splendid spirit of unity,
enthusiasm and determination, to
back up the confidence that has never
been lacking, the Williston Commer
cial Club rapidly approaching a state
of preparedness to grasp the already
evident opportunities of 1916 that
cannot fail to make the year one of
substantial achievements for Willis
ton and it's territory.
The holdover directors, the retiring
and the newly elected members met
at dinner at The Silver Grill Friday
evening for the purpose of electing
officers and reviewing the situation.
Fourteen were present and two ab
sent, M. J. Borden and W. H. Wester
gaard being out of the city.
Jackson President
Nominations for president were
made by a preliminary ballot and sev
eral members were thus placed before
the meeting among them G. B. Metz
ger, the past year's president, who
declined to allow the use of his name.
Formal balloting resulted in the elec
tion of Joseph W. Jackson. As one
of the city's pioneer businessmen Mr.
Jackson has during many former
years been closely associated with the
work of the club, served a term as
mayor of Williston and just recently
hesigned after two year's service on
the state board of control.
George Farries, publisher of the
Williston Herald for the past six
years, was elected to the vice presi
dency.
W. H. Westergaard of the Wester
paard-Blair Company was elected to
what is considered to be the tempor
ary secretaryship, it being generally
understood that before many months
a trained man will be employed to
^ive his whole time to this poSitiort.
For treasurer of the club S. M.
Hydle, cashier of the Williston State
bank was reelected.
It was decided to discontinue the
custom of meeting at Monday even
ing dinners but the board will meet
each Monday evening at seven o'elock,
for the present at the office of J. Ar
thur Cunningham. A special meeting
was also decided on for Friday even
ing of this week at the same place and
hour.
The meeting was marked by splen
did harmony and a united and confi
dent opinion that important work
must, can and will be done for Wil
liston the present year.
Big Year Ahead
A Graphic representative went to
each director, except Mr. Borden who
is still out of the city, and asked the
same question: What do you think
of the prospects for the year's work
of the Commercial Club. The an
swers are given below.
J. W. JACKSON
Never before was the outlook for
Williston and surrounding territory
more promising or encouraging than
it is to-day. Our 1915 crop created
great wealth. The proceeds have
gone to liquidate indebtedness, to pro
vide new improvements, stock and
equipment or remains here as cash on
deposit. Much grain is still in the
farmers granaries. The basic condi
tions of this locality are therefore bet
ter than they have ever heretofore
been. North Dakotas credit and par
ticularly this section of it is stronger
than at any period of its history.
Money is available for every legiti
mate enterprise and at lower rates of
interest. Recent census reports show
the percentage of increase in growth
of population greater in Williston
than in any other city of the State.
Our bank deposits, post office re
ceipts and railway traffic, as well as
the general business activity, hotel
trade and building operations under
way and contemplated are proof con
clusive of Williston's splendid devel
opment and uniform prosperity. It
follows naturally that more people—
and those with money to invest in
farm lands, mortgages, houses, build
ings, business enterprises and devel
opment projects of importance are
looking with increased favor on this
locality.
To take full advantage of this for
tunate situation Williston should put
forth its best and united efforts. Prob
ably a live, wide awake and active

Base Ball Board
Organized For Work
The base ball board decided on and
authorized by the meeting held last
week consists of J. W. Jackson, J. P.
Cutting, Geo. Leonhardy, W. J. Kelly
and C. L. Marshall. They held their
first meeting Saturday evening and
organized for the work of the sea
son. Mr. Jackson was urged to take
the chairmanship but begged off on
account of the pressure of other busi
ness. The officers of the board as
elected are: Chairman, C. L. Mar
shall Vice Chairman, Geo. Leon
hardy Secretary, J. P. Cutting
Treasurer, W. J. Kelly.
The board decided to divide the
managerial work into five depart
ments with each member in charge
of one department. The departments
and assignments are: Finances, Jack
son schedules, Cutting grounds,
Leonhardy scorers and umpires, Kel
ly advertising and publicity, Mar
shall.
A team of fast, clean players that
can win a majority of their games
and be a credit to the city, gotten to
gether and carried through the sea
son as economically as possible is the
result the board will strive to attain.
The first work will be to find a play
ing manager who is the right man for
the place in every respect. When
found he will be put to work in good
season to try out players, local and
others. Several prospects have been
written to by the secretary. Plans
for raising funds were discussed and
will be decided on soon.
Horse Rides 35 Miles
On Cake of Ice
Dickinson, N. D., Feb. 28.—Owing
to the rapidly rising water in the
Yellowstone river in Montana, 30
head of horses were caught on a semi
island by the flood, and all perished
with the exception of one, which in
some unaccountable manner climbed
onto a cake of ice, on which he float
ed for two days and two nights, until
finally rescued at Glendive, after
journey over the turbulent Yellow
stone for 35 miles. The horse was
watched by people on shore during the
greater part of the journey but was
past all aid until, {he blockofipe waa
whirled onto the flooded flats at
Glendive. Several pictures were
taken of the unusual river passenger
while passing underneath the big
bridge at Glendive. The animal stood
up during the entire journey and
seemed to brace its legs each time
the ice cake was jarred by striking
against other ice blocks.
Over 50 Per Cent
Naval Efficiency
Washington, Feb. 28.—The navy
now is ready to exert more than 50
per cent of its strength in ships and
guns. Read Admiral Austin M. Knight
president of the navy war college, told
the house naval committee today. He
urged the immediate addition of 25,
000 enlisted men, and the construc
tion of battle cruisers and scouting
craft to meet the situation.
The American ships, the admiral
said, are equal to any built and the
officers and men of the fleet are well
trained and efficient, but if the Atlan
tic fleet was ordered out today to de
fend the whole coast line, it would be
unable. to take all its available ships
for the lack of men, and would be
compelled to fight blindfolded for the
lack of scouts.
Can Locate Hay
For Those In Need
Through the courtesy of The Da
kota Farmer County Agent Hall has
letters from numerous parties having
hay for sale and will be glad to give
addresses to parties who need hay
and who are not able to secure it
locally. Mr. Hall says he is not in
the hay business and does not mean
to interfere with anyone who is but
makes this offer in the line of his
duties as a means of service to stock
men.
FAMOUS LECTURER COMING
Hon. H. Scott Bennett, for seven
years a member of the New Zealand
Parliament, and who for some months
past has been on a tour of the U. S.
is now on his return trip to his home
in the South Pacific.
Through the efforts of some of our
local citizens who learned in advance
that he was traveling via the Great
Northern road, he has been induced
to stop off at Williston on Saturday,
March 11, and remain over Sunday,
speaking in the court house both
evenings. To those interested in
stories of that far away country, this
will be a rare treat.
D. O'DONNELL TO
ARRIVE TONIGHT
NATIONAL SUPERVISOR OF IR
RIGATION WILL CONFER WITH
LOCAL WATER USERS
Pioneer In Irrigation and Considered
Most Practical Man With the
Service
I. D. O'Donnell, Supervisor of
Irrigation, will arrive in Williston,
Thursday evening, March 2, and will
be in consultation with water usera
of the Williston Project all day Fri
day, March 3.
Friday morning, Mr. O'Donnell will
be in the project office, where individ
ual water users or other interested
persons can talk with him.
Important Meeting 2 P. M„ Friday
The important meeting of the day
will be one with all of the water
users at the Odd Fellows' Hall at
2 o'clock Friday afternoon. At this
meeting Mr. O'Donnell will expect t*
get such information as to the de
velopment of the project, the needs of
the water users, the payments that
may be depended upon, etc., as will
enable him to decide whether water
will be furnished in 1916.
It is good news that Mr. O'Donnell
is taking up this matter so early, aa
a decision will probably be made soon
and the farmers can make their
preparations of the coming season ac
cordingly.
Will Meet Directors
Mr. O'Donnell will be invited to be
present at a special meeting of the
directors of the Commercial Club Fri
day evening at seven sharp, at Mr.
Cunningham's office.
Mr. O'Donnell is known as the "Al
falfa King" of Montana. His large
farm near Billings is generally class
ed as one of the finest in the North
west. Mr. O'Donnell has developed
the farm and the irrigation system
which supplies it during his residence
in that section where he may be
classed as one of the pioneers. He ia
not a non-resident with a farm for a
hobby, but a farmer who has made
Iris living from, the farm and is one
who speaks with the authority of a
long and well grounded experience.
In the early days of the present ad
ministration Mr. O'Donnell visited
Washington in the interests of irrigv
tion fanners in various sections of
Montana. Secretary Lane of the In
terior Department, was so impressed*
with the thoroughness and equipment
of the farmers' representative that he
invited Mr. O'Donnell to become Na
tional Supervisor of Irrigation, a po
sition which Secretary Lane created'
to promote the interests of irrigation'
farmers and the development of irri
gated farms.
E. C. Carney Out
For Senatorship
Before leaving on an eastern busi
ness trip E. C. Carney, who repre
sented this district in the lower house
of the last legislature, authorized the
statement that he would formally an
nounce his candidacy for the state
senate on his return. Mr. Carney is
an old resident of the community and
has been connected in many ways with
the development of the city and coun
try that he feels justify him in aspir
ing to this high position.
He is a graduate of Juniata college,
Pennsylvania, and graduated from
the law department of North Dakota
university. He came to Williston in
1905 as United States Commissioner
and as such took many filings for land
in both Williams and McKenzie coun
ties. He has always had many in
terests in McKenzie county and is a
large taxpayer there.
He has held many positions of trust
and responsibility in this city among
them president of the Commercial
Club and member of the City Com
mission. With other commercial club
members he was instrumental in se
curing such institutions as the land1
office and the experimental farm. As:
a member of the last legislature Mrv
Carney cites his activity for the most
important legislation that came up.
He was chairman of the committee of
eleven on experimental farms, the re
port of which saved the appropriation
for the farms. He was author of the
semi-annual tax payment bill which
failed of passage by a narrow mar
gin. In the land, loan and law busi
ness he has been successful and is
regarded as a substantial business
man.
"I will go before the voters on my
record" said Mr. Carney "and will be
satisfied to abide by their decision.
