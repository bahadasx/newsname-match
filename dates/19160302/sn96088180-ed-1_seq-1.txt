Washington, Mar. 2. President
Wilson this afternoon authorized the
following statement regarding the
Oore speech in the senate, In which
Senator Oore claimed the president
had intimated to congressmen his
readiness to go to war with Germany
If the Teutons maintained their
course In the international situation:
"When the attention of the White
House waa called to certain state
ments in Senator Core's speech thla
afternoon, the president authorised
an unqualified denial of any utter
ance to which any such meaning
could be attached."
It was stated authoritatively that
what actually occurred at the con
ference to which Oore referred waa
this:
Action such as warning Americana
off armed ships would (bring the
country to the brink of war, the pre
sident said. Encouraged by the ac
tion of congress Germany would
believe that the country wss not be
hind the president and would Insist
upon going ahead with Ita submarine
warfare plans.
At any time an American might
be killed. Then, in the light of the
American notes about submarine at
tacks, America could do nothing but
sever diplomatic relations with Ger
many. But Colonel House, the Wil
son envoy, and Ambassador von
Bernstorff bad Informed the presi
dent that such a severance would re
sult In a declaration, of war" toy Ger
many. The president had teen in
formed that Amerlca'a entrance Into
the war would result In ending It
within six months.
President Wilson then expressed
the devout hope that congress wpuld
precipitate no action hampering the
upholding of International law. He
told them that only firm maintenance
of the rights America had declared
for, and a demand that these rights
be respected could maintain the peace
of America.

Washington, Mar. 2. While PresI
dent Wilson watchfully waited for
the country to force congress to sup

warning resolution, fought strongly
for his measure. He told hla listen
ers he had heard that President WI1-
was prepared to go to war If neces
sary, and tlut some senators thought
war would be a iblesslng.
His resolution, he said, would save
