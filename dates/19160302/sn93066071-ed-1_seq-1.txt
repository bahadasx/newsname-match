ANOTHER HOME DESTROYED BY FIRE.
Kurly dun day morning the (Ire
demon Rgain played havoc in another
one of our homos, the. residence of J.
B Norton being burned to the ground.
The lire had gained uch headway be
fore discovered that it was impossible
to extinguish it and it was only by
quick work that the occupants of tho
lnuse were aroused and gotten out
Bafely. Only a few minor articles of
furniture weru saved. The exact origin
of the 11 ru is not known but it is
thought that the blaze was started
from a Kayo lamp. 31 r. Norton had
gotten up nnil built the lire aim re
turned to bed leaving the Kayo lamp
burning. M rs. Norton aroso soon after
ward and was dressing when she heard
an unusual noise in the kitchen and
opening tliRjdoor found the room in
llames. She gave the alarm as quickly
as poj9lblu but the tire had gained such
headway that it was beyond control
before tho arrival of help and all that
could be done, wan to prevent Its
spread to adjoining buildings. Even
this would have been almost impossi
ble bad it not been for the timely
arrival of the city lire lightning appa
ratus. The small housa of Lon Ford
which stood aear trie premises narrow
ly averted being consumed and the
new, home of Mr. and Mrs Ai & 'Dick
son, just across the street, seemed to
bo in grave danger.
This loss is a seven; one for Mr.
Norton and family and one which they
will feel for many years, for prac
tically everything they had in their
home was consomedi Fortunately
they carried $800 00 insurance which
will go a long nay toward replacing
the building.
At tin time of the fire Mrs. Norton
was conducting a boarding house and
had a Urge number of' laborers board
lug with her. These men each donated
their services for a day and material
was placed on the ground and a new
hnmecotnmenced Monday. The build
ing will have ve rooms and is being
built just north of the burned site.
The Herald is sorry to note this
misfortune which has come to our
fellow townsmen and joins with a host
of friends iu expressing regret for
their loss.
WHAT IS DOING IN THE RESIDENCE
SECTION OF BEAYER.
The day being line and not having
anything in particular to do, J. K.
Qulnn took a stroll about Deaver one
day last week to see what was doing
in the building line in the residence
section. Upon his return he reported
to the Herald olllce what he had
found. His report was as follows:
51 new houses completed and ready
for occupancy or occupied ; 12 under
course of construction ; 0 tents being
used for living purposes and 3 dug
outs. AH of these improvements
have been made since the Heaver rail
road reached the north side of the
townslto and this is only the begin
ning. Kverj day material is hauled
oat and new houses commenced. Just
at this time, we are reliably informed
ot at least six more new homes which
will be commenced before another
Usue of this paper is mailed. The
boom Is on for sure and no mistake
about It. , Many have heeded the
advice of the Herald and gotten In on
tho ground floor. Those who would
have laughed us to scorn a few months
ago because we assured tho people
that tho railroad was going to be built
and thnt tlio time for Investment was
then, now have Vlaugh coming on tho
other side of their face and the Herald
can point with pride to our continual
boosting for old Heaver and say, "I
told-you sp," Watch Heavor Grow.
BEAYERWILLHAYEAUTO RACE.
When it comes to doing things,
Beaver very seldom lets any town pull
off a bigger tunt thin wo can pull off,
and it h not her intention now to sit
idly by and see our neighbor
ing .towns indulging in automobile
races without getting into the game.
Accordingly, at a special meeting of
auto enthusiasts one evening the past
week, it was decided that Heaver have
an Auto race in the near future nnd
"Chief" II. P. Garrett was chosen to
take charge of tho affair and make the
necessary arrangements. The date
for the race was not definitely decided
upon but it was suggested that it be
held sometime in April Only stock
cars wi'l'bo eligible to entry, all rac
ing cars being barred. The route has
not been fully determined upon but
Beaver will be the starting point and
the course will probably be via Ualko,
Gray, Ochiltree, Texas, and LaKemp,
returning to Beaver. A complete
program and definite plans will be
announced later bb will also the purse.
All autoists who have the racing fever
should get in communication with
"Chief" at once

OLDlLORY QUARTET.
The Old Glory Quartet appeared at
the Globo Wednesday night ot last
week, being another number of the
Lyceum course and, to our notion, the
best number of the entire series,
although somo of tho other numbers
have been very good indeed. Four
men comprised the company and they
were all good. Tho entertainment

HELP BOOST THE OIL WELL
-Jcim Taylor was over from pate this
week boosting for the oil well at that
place and trying to sell some stock in
the project. The well is now down to
a depth of 2,000 feet and it is the
desire of the promoters to sink it at
least 3,500 feet in order to make a
thorough test of it, unless of coarse
oil or gas is found without drilling
that far. Mr. Taylor states that the
indications are extremely favorable
and the people of that vicinity are
working hard to raise suQIeient money
to go on down with the hole as far as
necessary. Since so much money has
already been put into the project and
the opportunity to make a thorough
test seems to be mow or never, all who
can do so should certainly boost the
enterprise along with as large a sub.
scription of stock as possible. If oil
or gas is foUnd In paying quantities,
the investment will be a good one. If
it is not found, we will at least have
tho satisfaction ot knowing that 'a
thorough test was made and that we
had a hand in trying to develop Bea
ver county resources. The Herald
gladly made another donation to 'the
good cause because we believe In help
ing boost any legitimate enterprise
and. if necessary, we will try to "dig
up" agaiu rather than ede the good
people of Gate fall to get their well
down to the desired depth.

OFF TO THE BIG CONVENTION.
J. W.Steflen, of LaKemp. familiarly
known all over Heaver county as
"Pete" Steffen, the High Dollar Auc
tioneer, was here this week enronte to
Oklahoma City, to which place he
goes to take in the big State Breeders'
Stock and Sa,le .Show, which convened
in thatcity March 4th to 10th, and the
State Auctioneers' Association, held at
the same place March 0th. Mr. Ste.f-
fen Is a member of the State Auction
eers' Association and a regular atten
dant at the annual meetings, having
gained considerable prominence over
the State as an auctioneer and is fre
quently called to surrounding coun
ties to cry sales. He is also popular
at home, as well as abroad, and enjoys
a liberal share of the sales in this
county. While a little early in the1
day, we hear Mr. Steffen spoken of as
a prospective candidate for sheriff in
the coming primary. We do not know'
whether he would consent to make tne
race or not but if he did decide to do
so, he would be a live wire from the
moment he threw his hat iu the ring.
How about it, Pete?
GUYMOH'S $1000.00 AUTO RACE.
It IS, Qulnn was down from Guymon
yesterday and while here paid the
Herald a call. He told us of the big
auto race which the fans of that town
are promoting and which will bo ijeld
March 31st. A purse of $1000.00 has
been subscribed and placed on deposit
in tho Guymon bank and Mr. Qulnn
announces that there Is to be no fake
or deception about the big event which
they plan to pull off but that the
money will be ready for the winners at
tho conclusion of the race. There
appears to b e some dissatisfaction
about the Liberal race last week in
that the amount of money which
Liberal proposed to put up as much a
purse was not forthcoming, eo Guymon
enthusiasts decided to haye a race of
their own and leading men of the town
are vouching for the $1,000 00 purse.
The route for the race will be from
Guymon to Hooker, thonce to Tyrone.
Elkhart, Kansas, Boise City, Tezhoma
and return to Guymon, Further
announcement of I h e program will
appear in the Herald next week,
