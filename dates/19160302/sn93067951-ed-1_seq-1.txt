A Weekly Review *
Of The Great War i
i
Inspired by the presence of ^
their Emperor and led by Orown j1
Prince Frederick Willitm, th** 8
German troops are engagrd in j
< lie of the greatest battles of ? he o
war on the western front, cen- 8
tering around the fortress of z
Verdnn. Attack has followed
attack against the French line n
after bombardments incessant d
and terrific, continuing|for sever- ft
ul (lays. e
While the Germans have not a
been able, despite the rain of i<
shells and furious onslaughts by tl
the infantry, to break the S
French line, nevertheless the P
French on their right and left S
wings have been compelled to
withdraw their lines, respective- ir
ly to the south of Ornes and be- tl
hind the town of Samogneux, si
six miles north of the fortress. tl
The German attack on this si
French stronghold has become one pi
Iof the chief operations of the war. di
It is the first tfiort since the C
original drive of the German 01
armies to break through the G
main line of the French and n<
strike for Paris?for there can G
be little doubt that l'aris would
become the objective if Verdun ec
were captured and the French to
! defense at that point broken, hi
, The position is one of the strong- Tl
t est in Europe, and, perhaps, the R
strongest on the western front, tl
The Germans are making a real- Hi
]y desperate effort to capture it, w
I and aiready have paid a heavy m
price tor t he initial success they Ti
have had, and they have made B
n ? more tlian a dent in the rim tli
vt the citadel. The cost of com- so
plete success on the same scale e)
wt uld be staggering, but long fill
; Defore that is reached, the ef- B
i tort mpy be found in vain. The is
chances are that it will be. For hi
all the gallantry and terrific w
power of Hie Germans, the cap- d<
r L _ . ? -i_ J . i
)iui" < i men a sirongnoiu as \ er- n-i
dun, defended by some of the in
best so)dier3 ill Europe, equipped
with weapons fully equal to p(
anything the Germans them- di
selves huve, is a task that may w
well prove impossible of achieve- te
inent. The stake is tremendous al
and the battle will ui questionably
be one of the mightiest is
conflicts of the war. di
. lu Africa the French and Brit- T:
Ish liave completed the occupa- to
lion of German Kameran, and ?t
the British have undertaken the 111
fconqnest of German east Africa. ?I
In Asia joint operations against 8t
It he Turks are being conducted
ffrom three points; the British |)
northward from the Persian
Kiulf, the Russians southward
Ifrom the Caspian and the Caucasus.
"
Last fall, when the Grand ^
?
Duke Nicholas was removed
from the supreme command of
the Russian armies and sent to ^
the Caucasus, it was commonly j "
supposed that. t his meant banishment
in disgrace because of j^1
his failure to save Poland. But]
now it seems rather that he was 1
being given an opportunity to
retrieve bis reputation by con- C
ducting the most important cam- ei
puign of the winter. At any ?
ru til lift t iq m lift t liik h
for his swift advance and speedy j f<
capture of Krzeuini is a brilliant !e
l?*ut of arms, comparable to Ids b
(i a 11 c i a 11 campaign of a year ago
^ien lie eaptured Przemysl and &
oF oneil t he crest of the Carpa- r(
thians. In fact the Russians Sl
seem to light best in cold weather.
Erzerum was captured when t
I he mercury was thirty degrees e
below zero und the mountain
passes filled with snow.
Only a hundred miles northwest
of E zerum, is the ancient f
city of Trebizoird, where Xeno i
phon's Greeks first saw the sea. 11
This has several times been i
bombarded by the Russian war-j p
ships and now a landing has o
been made about fifteen miles p
H| the east. With this port once *
in their possession the Russians ]
Br will have as secure a hold on the 1
oontberu^ittoral of the Black'c
>ea us they have on the north-!
Tn and eastern. There seems
it-tie chance of the Turks retakngEizerum,
for it is over six
mndred miles from Constantilople
and there are no railroads 1
eading toward it, while Rus- 1
ians have the railroad from
Cars coming within eighty miles '
n the northeast and are likely
non .o have the port of Trebi- 1
ond on the northwest.
All through this part, of Ar
lenia American missionaries. 1
octors and teachers have been 1
ctive for many years. In Erzrum
there is a school for bovs I
nd another for girls. The Amer- {
an Board had five stationed ,
here, the Reverened Robert S. ?
tapleton and his wife. Dr. E. 1
Case, Miss Atkins and Miss
I
nerman. t
The Turks have been engaged j
i clearing the ArmenianR out of
le region into which the Has* B
ans are now advancing because <?
re Armenians favored the Rusans.
In the course of these re- f
ulsions and deportations hunreds
of thousands of Armenia!
hristians have been murdered
perished by the way. Oui
overnment has addressed a
:>te of protest to the Ottoman
overnment. 1
The Russian army which pass1
south of Erzerum is reported h
? have reached the city of M ush,
?ty miles west- of Lake Van. d
his would indica^^^MM the
ussians iin f

Lpedition under General Townlend

agdad is invested hy a Turk- jj
h force at Kut-el-Amara, a
inMred miles down the river,
hile the relief expedition un- 8
?r General Aylmer is held up ^
Sheikh Said, about thirty-five n
iles below. c
More alarming still is the re- c
)rt that the third British expe- F
tion under General Brooking,
hich had gone up the Euphra8
Kiver as far as Masirjeh. is ^
so in trouble.
It seems, then that if the Brit- j
h are to be rescued from their ^
mgerous predicament on the ^
igrip, the Russians must come j
their rescue. This they are
ndently doing with astonishg
celerity considering the *
mracter of the country and the)1

' Fleeing Youth Shot
By Rural Policeman
Last Thursday afternoon while a
running from Rural Policeman
E. W. Moore, stationed at McBee,
John Boan, a youth of 17 e
years, was shot through the face '
and 8?iiou8lay injured. 8
It seems that young Boan had s
bought a bicycle in Camden and |
moved from there to Chester- ,
i- L.f a
uoiu county ueiure payments on
the wheel were completed. A ^
warrant for his arrest was issued ^
and forwarded for execution to e
# Mr. Moore. 1
* When Moore was looking for 2
the lad he is said to have met r
him in the road and not know- ^
ing him, asked him where voung c
Boan could be found. Receiving
an evasive reply, Moore ask- 1
ed a woman nearby the same 8
question and was told that that c
was Boan to whom he was talk- r
Moore is said to have turned 1
and started after the boy, who
took to his heels, when the po- *
liceman is alleged to have fired, v
- and Boan fell seriously wounded. r
Q In extenuation Mr. Moore. ^
o says he only fired to frighten the v
O youth, that boy turned his head r
O in time to receive the ball in his e
o lower jaw. It took an upward e
o course and emerged through the '
O opposite cheek. c
o The boy received first aid from
o Dr. Gregory and was then sent
O to the hospital at Columbia,
O where he was visited by Sheriff
Q D. P. Douglass, who says the j
O doctors report him in a fair way
