disease. Caaes are reported also
in the Manker, Grant, Chavez

said to have been exposed, so it
is probable the community is in

LIVELY AT DURAN
Holding the office of justice of
the peace at Duran may result in
some strenuous times according
to a letter written by Justice J.
A. Will to the attorney general.
The New Mexican prints the
letter verbatim in order to give
its readers a chance to smile over
what the assistant attorney gen
eral calls the "Texas language."
However, violence to the rules
of grammar and orthography is
by no means confined to those
who write in the Texas language.
and there are many others whose
literary efforts would cause
smiles if printed verbatim.
Mr. Will's letter is in sub
stance as follows:
"I would like to be advised by
return .mail, what to do in this
case, as it is to be tried next Sat
urday. The circumstances are
as follows: A few nigh's ago I
saw a person assault another by
slapping him, and deputized sev
eral citizens to arrest the offend
er. He resisted and called for
his brother, who came to take
him away by force. I deputized
others to put the rescuer under
arrest, and while I was attend
ing to this arrest, the first one
broke from his captors, siezed a
rock and struck me in the back
with it I directed the men to
recapture him, and went to see
that the other was locked up.
During this time the first one
made his get away. The mother
of the boys was told that her son I
was in jail, so she went to the
jail and made a racket and then
went to where a dance was soma
on and called out her youngest
son and told him. They went to
the iail, and the youngest broth
er started down the street on a
run yelling that be was going to
get a gun and kill me. I was
told of this by a responsible party,
and a few minutes later started
toward the dance accompanied
by my informant and two others.
We met the boy who made the
threats, and observing him get
ting ready to draw something I
deputized the men with me to ar
rest and search him, and they
took a butcher knife away from
him. During these proceedings
the first one arrested appeared
twice, and I had him re arrested
and put them both in jail. All
three were kept in jail that night,
but were released next morning
after giving bond to appear Sat
urday. 1 would like to have your opin
ion as to who should make com
plaint against these boys, and as
to whether." under the circum
stances I would be disqualified to
try them. Also, in case they
should wish to waive a prelim
inary, whether I could put them
under bond to appear before the
grand jury."
The attorney general advised
Mr. Will that it would be neces
sary to take the case before an
other justice.

putting in bumper crops to tell
other folks about it, but maybe
we can tell a few of the things
we are doing just now.
The telephone is an established
article in this vicinity, most
every family having one in their"
home. Of course they are kept
busy most of the time some on
business, some on pleasure, some
just trying to see if the -thing
will talk, and some oh well, we
won't tell what some of these
bachelors and widowers use them
for, eh?
Miss Caroline DeHart of Cedar
Grove went to Aztec, N. M., on

been put on and ready for quilt

quilt was donated by Mrs. Marsh
and will be put together soon.
This will be something extra and
will be put together with white
and lined with white and should
bring a good price. So anyone
wanting such a auilt should
speak. A very substantial and
appetizing dinner was prepared
by the hostess, assisted by her
daughter, Mrs. Milford Milbourn,
and all did justice to the meal.
Our president, Mrs. Ben Young,

ing was opened and presided over

of them, are nice socially. The
next meeting will be March 23rd
with Mrs. Milford Milbourn.
where we will finish piecing the
quilt now under construction.
We have decided to meet only
once a month, as the farmers and

to see the silos and fat cattle and
many implements on the farm.
