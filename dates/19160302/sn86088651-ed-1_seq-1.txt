Tho Texas Farmers' Union Pretested
Against Discrimination and
Wired Congressmen.
Fort Worth, Tex.. March :. Tho
Texas Farmers' liilon Wednesday
went on record opposing an open sea
I'olb y unless such a polit y Is to ap
ply to tot ton and all other farm
products.
In a teleKram to Texan members of
congress Henry X. pope, president of
Hie union, outlined the position of his
inc luhi-rshlp as follows:
"Tin' oricuihed farmers of this
state lire op-o-i-d to keeping ttn open
sea to travelers ami tourists unlet- we
cun also kee;i an ripen sen to cotton
nil farm produ i. Tho farmer of
Ibis coi.iitry want a !iu.t that will pro
tect th man In the furrow as well as
the man on the ship We favor an

!Irliiilntn.'
In defemliiiK the position taken by
the union, Mr. Cop said:
"The farmers of the South an
smarting under Hie failure of our gov
eminent to render any assistant e
whatever In eltlo-r holding or market
ing the iott.ni crop i'f l'-'ll mid II' I a.

cotton values destroyed by the pres
ent war than by the civil war. The
p ace and dignity of this nation Is as
ninth offended when European battle
ships destroy the value of cotton by
dosing a market as if they destroyed
the cotton with (tins. The farmer of
the South had as well be shot as
starved, and one Is no greater rrltne
than tint other. Let the sea be open
or closed. "
