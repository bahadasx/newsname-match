MAYOR ROM1Q MAKES Ft Ml "OUT
ON MUNICIPAL CONVENTION

Prom a standpoint of interest and
eathuslasm the smoker held by the
Commercial Club in the city hall
Monday night was one of the best ev
er held. While there was not a large
crowd present all the available seat
tag space in the council chamber of
the city hall was occupied by a repre
sentative gathering of business men
aad farmers and subjects brought up
were discussed freely.
Mayor Romlg gave a report of the
Municipal Convention which he re
cently attended at Kearney. He said
that although Alliance has been a
Member of the organization for eight
fMrm, this was the first time she had
been represented. Various questions
t importance to all cities were dis
assed and the mayor stated that he
sit well repaid for bis trouble In at
tending. Before he finished his re
port his hearers were also convinced
that the trip had been well worth
while.
Among the questions threshed out
at the convention were the milk ord
inance, good roads, street paving, dis
fosltton of garbage, auto ordinance
aad street grading. Mr. Romlg stat
ed that many of the cities have a
nore severe milk ordinance than Al
liance and that they enforce it. He
mentioned provisions of the ordin
ances in several of the cities and said
lie will recommend a new milk ord
iaance for Alliance stipulating among
ether things a license fee of 25 cents
and also designating that the Cream
ery shall pasteurite.
The discussion of good roads dis
closed the fact that parties who have
experimented in this work consider
the magnesia beds near Alliance to
be the best material available for the
Making of good hard roads. Parties
from the eastern part of the state
made inquiry as to what price they
eould obtain 100 car loads of this de
posit. It was reported at the convention
hat a movement is now on for the
construction of a highway from Min
neapolis to Cheyenne through Siojx
City, Norfolk, Chadron and alliance.
A special committee will go over the
rente in April.
Mr. Romlg stated that paving
seems to be a hobby in the eastern
part of the state and that many citien
mailer than Alliance have now or
are contracting for from one to six
miles of paved streets. The enforce
ment of the auto ordinance in some
f these cities is facilitated by the
placing of a light in the intersection.
Other improvement! that will proba
bly be considered by Alliance as a re
alt of Information obtained at the
convention will be tie disposition of
garbage by Incineration, for which a
plant would cost between $2000 and
$3000; the placing of cement gutter
ing on Box Butte avenue; the oiling
of roads and the purchase of a tractor
for grading purposes.

CO-OPERATIVE SPIRIT
Guthrie Receives Letter of tngratu
. lation on Efforts to Secure Con
vention of Insurance Men
J. W. Guthrie, who attended the
convention .of local Insurance agents
of the state of Nebraska, held last
week at Grand Island, has received a'
letter from Harry Koch, department
manager at Omaha for the Massachu
setts Bonding and Insurance Com
pany, congratulating Alliance on the
co-operative spirit shown here among
the merchants and business men.
Mr. Guthrie attended the conven
tion as a member of the association
and also as a special representative of
the Alliance Commercial Club, of
which he is president, and he made a
strong fight to land the 1917 conven
tion for Alliance. There were nearly
two hundred registered at the con
vention, and had the vote been taken
at a session when all the delegates
were present it is believed Alliance
would have been successful. As it
was, Kearney beat Alliance by only
six votes.
It is such letters as Mr. Koch's
that awaken us to a realization of the
real value of co-operation among the
merchants and shows that In spite of
the disposition of a few to under es
timate the value of a live commercial
organization, the city of Alliance
through its club is attracting favora
ble attention on the outside. Mr.
Koch's letter follows:
Mr. Frank Martin has Just exhibit
ed to me all the telegrams which he
received, as secretary of the Nebras
ka state association of Local Fire In
surance Agents, and I cannot pass an
opportunity to congratulate you up
on the splendid work which you did
in an endeavor to secure the conven
tion for next year. I am really very
sorry that you wet not successful.
However, if you are governed by the
suggestion which Mr. Martin made
you for lining up the convention next
year, I feel sure you will be able to
win out.
The merchants of your town, whom
I understand are all members of the
Alliance Commercial Club, showed
the kind - of cooperation that is
bound to win out and they are cer
tainly to be congratulated for their
boosting spirit and prompt activity.
If your merchants give such sup
port to all public movements Alliance
is bound to be a mighty good town.
Although you were not successful in
securing this convention, your efforts
were not in vain, for you have ac
complished something that was con
siderable, for we are all for you
strong and hope you will win ont in
1917.
With klndeBt personal regards, I
remain
Youth very truly.

PICTURES THE TERRIBLE
CONSEQUENCES OF VICE
The Wonderful Story of Damaged
Goods, in Seven Acta, to He Pre
wilted at Imperial, Monday
Probably one of the best pictures
that Alliance "movie" goers will have
an opportunity to see this season will
be "Damaged Goods," a vital drama
of moral uplift, to be shown in seven
awe-inspiring parts at the Imperial
theatre next Monday night.
This is one of the really high class
productions in the moving picture
world, and it is being shown almost
exclusively in the metropolitan cities
as its cost is almost prohibitive to the
smaller cities. Mr. DuBuque is tak
ing a chance in securing a picture of
this character and if the people of
Alliance appreciate his efforts to
give them the very best to be had
they should show it In a substantial
way.' " " ' '
"Damaged Goods" pictures the ter
rible consequences of vice and the
physical ruin that follows abuBe of
the moral law. It Is a stirring plea
for a pure life before marriage, in
order to make impossible the trans
mission of hereditary taints to future
generations.
Prices for the matinee and the ev
ening show are given in Mr. Du
Buque's ad elsewhere in this issue of
The Herald.
SALE POSTPONED
F. McCoy, who has been advertis
ing a public sale of live stock, farm
Implements and household goods to
be held today at his place eight miles

MARRIAGE BUSINESS SLOW
Judge Kerry's Record Show Ten LI
ceiiNet iHMiied in January mid
Only Eight In February -
February was a light month so far
as the marriage license business in
County Judge L. A. Berry's office was
concerned. The record so far for the
year 1916 is a poor one and would
indicate that there is something
wrong somewhere in the marriage
market. However, leap year is only
Just begun, and the fair sex has plen
ty of time In which to improve the
record thus far made. Then licenses
were Issued by County Judge Berry
during the month of January and on
ly eight during the month of Febru
ary. The number of licenses issued
for the year ending' January 1 ex
ceeded the previous year's report by
nine. 143 licenses being issued in
1914. and 152 in 1915.
