RKPORTS of the capture of a
German sea raider, either the

the cruiser noon, came to hand to
day from South American sources
The capture is said to have been
effected by British cruisers which
took their prise to Trinidad, off the
Venezuelan coast. It was a crew
from the Moewe that brought the
British steamer Appata a prise
into Newport News
After a lull In infantry opera
tions In tho vicinity of Verdun
since the early part of the week,
there has been a resumption of the
German offensive in tho Woevre
region.
A violont bombardment was fol
lowed by a spirited attack on the
French at Fresnes, ten miles south
east of Verdun. Paris reportB the
driving out, of the Germans from
the few positions which they suc
ceeded in penetrating.
Admnce Is DIITieuM
Dispatches from both Berlin and
Paris point to tho difficulties of
a further advance In this region.
The French -positions, Paris points
out, stretch along tho Meuse
heights, from which the ground
drops abruptly to the Woevre plain
with its moist clay soil, across
which the transportation of the
heaviest of the German artillery on
ground away from the high roads
Is held to be almost Impossible,
While the attacking troops would
have to deploy into the open under
the fire of the French guns on the
heights.
Cnsunlty Report DlfTrr
Estimates of the German losses
in the offensive are running high
In entente quarters, one from Paris
placing them at between 115,000
and 130.000. All accounts from
German sources, however, declared
that the casualties of the attack

Paris dispatches sav the press and
public of France are mystified at the

around Verdun. It Is thought likely
they are merely resting before starting

Carrancista soldiers came into the hotel
and began pounding on the doors In
the Chinese quarters, the door was
forced and during the engagement some
four of the Carrancistas lost their lives.
' Then followed a general search of
the hotel and when the soldiers came to
my door 1 did not open It quick enough
for them. They found a pistol in my
possession and hit me over the head
witn the butt of a guj and beat me.
We then went out into the patio of the
hotel, and my life was threatened. They
shot Charlie Che down within 30 feet
of me, blowing tne top of his head off.
I thought they would shoot me.
Officer Stop the Slaughter.
''As 'soon as this was done, some of

Well, here he is ' Then one of them
asked me for my pistol, which I handed
them. Another took tho watch from
my pocket There wore seven men in
the room. Next thing I knew I was hit

"I was then taken from the room.
