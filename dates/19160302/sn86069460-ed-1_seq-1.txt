DEATH REMOVES A
Mrs. Sarah E. Nunn, Known to A
Great Number, Passes Away
After a Lingering Illness.
Mrs. S. E. Nunn. wife of M.
Y. Nunn, Sr., died Saturday
morning, Feb. 2Cth. 1016. at 8
o'clock, at the Nunn farm south
,of the city limits. She had been
ill most of the new year but suf
fered a relapse two weeks ago,
following an attack of Lagrippe
of unusual severity attended also
with kidney trouble. She was a
great sufferer during her last
days and nothing which physic
ians or trained nurse could sug
gest seemed to offer much re
lief or rest until death inter
vened. Miss Shaw, her nurse,
did all in her power as did Drs.
Clement and Fox her attending
physicians. The beloved remaius
were removed Saturday after
noon from her home in the coun
try to the residence of her son,
Dr. F. W. Nunn, on West Depot
street, in this city, where the
funeral was conducted by her
pastor Rev. J. A. Chandler Sun
day afternoon at 2 o'clock. The
house would not hold those who
called to show respect to the de
ceased. The service was most
impressive and was interspersed
with sweet hymns which were
her known favorites, and appro
priately closed with the reading
bv Rev. Chandler of the follow
ing beautiful poem, entitled:
SLEEP ON
Sleep on beloved, sleep and take thy rest.
Lay down thy head upon the Saviour's breast;
We love thee well, but Jesus loves thee best-
Good-night!
Calm is thy slumber as an infant's sleep:
But thou shalt wake no more to toil and weep:
Thine is a perfect rest, secure and deep-
Good-night!
Until the shadows from this earth are cast;
Until He gathers in His sheaves at last;
Until the twilight gloom be over past-
Good-night!
Until the Easter glory lights the skies;
Until the dead in Jesus shall arise,
And He shall come but not in lowly guise
q, Good-night!
Until made beautiful by Love Divine,
Thou, in the likeness of thy Lord shalt shine,
And He shalt bring that golden crown of thine-
Good-night!
Only "Good-night," beloved, not "farewell!"
A little while and alf His saints shall dwell
In Hallowed unison indivisible
Good-night!
Until we meet again before His throne,
Clothed in the spotless robe He gives His own,
Until we know even as we are known -
Good-night!

Parties owing 1915 city tax and
for years prior, will save costs
by paying same at once. I will
begin to levy for this tax within
ten days from date of this notice.

and me trouble and an unpleas
ant duty, by calling at my place
of. business and settling same.
A. S. Cannan,
City Tax Collector.
Editor Crittenden Record-Press,
Dear Sir:
As a sufficient amount has not
yet been subscribed to insure the
payment of Crittenden county's
j)rtdf Mr. Bird's salary, and
feeling that it would be a great
189 to the county to abandon the
work, I authorize you to say to
the people of the county that
will be one of sixty to subscribe
ten dollars each. I am sure we
have more than that number in
this county ready to give more
than that sum if necessary, when
their attention is called to it.

CORN & PIG CLUBS
Let Everyone Encourage Them So
As to Make Old Crittenden the
Banner Club County of Ky.
In organizing our clubs for
191G we asked that only bovs and
girls that meant to grow the corn
and raise the nigs, giv e in their
names. If this is the case Crit
tenden county will have 50 acres
of corn grown by Corn Club boys
and 100 pigs cared for bv Pis
Club members. If every one will
join hands and encourage and
help push this along we will
make Crittenden the banner Club
County of the State of Kentucky.
