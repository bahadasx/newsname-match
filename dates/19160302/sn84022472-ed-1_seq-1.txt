GunsnoT EXPERTS
GALLED TO STAND
111 HAINES TRIAL
Blody Fingerprints at Farm
house Brought Into Trial
- For-First Time.
Today's session in the trial of Ja
fton S. Haines for the murder of his
wife, "Anna, when both were residing
on the Chestnut Hill road, Trumbull,
last September resulted in open op
position to the first of a series of ex
perts that have been summoned for
the state. .
j , During an effort to present expert
testimony on the character and man
ufacture of . shot" gun shells ty Leon
William Beardsley. a well known
experimenter in the subjects of guns
and ammunition, the -state felt com
pelled to Withdraw the witness and
: an adjournment was taken until later
when. It was expected that ballistic
heads of the Union Metallic Cartridge
Co. might answer summons sent to
them.
v For the first time in the testimony
offered for the 'state, the appearance
of bloody prints, probably of a hand,
were disclosed to have been visible
on the rear of the Haines home
shortly after the crime. Sheriff
Simeon E. Pease, who was -again re
called to the stand today testified of
having seen such prints.
That it was George E. Hayes, a
former Bridgeport policeman, who
turned Haines over to the authori
ties of Newtown on the morning1 of
capture was made plain today in
sworn statements of Hayes, who dis
closed the fact that Haines was seen
standing on the main street by him
and remained there for nearly 10
minutes while Hayes was summoning
Sheriff Blakeman and Constable
Thomas Carlson. An effort on the
part of the defense to have the wit
ness testify as to Haines cpndition
at the time of capture was success
fully opposed by the state with the
result' that the witness was asked to
remain in the court that he - might
be called for the defense if wanted.
Constable Thomas- Carlson, of New
town, told of placing Haines under
arrest and taking from his left' side
coat pocket several loaded gun shells.
It was further shown that the New
town lockup in which Haines 5.s
placed was so damp and cold . that
the -officers were unable to remain in
side with Haines but were compelled
to seek the xterior of the building to
keep warm. ,
Though the witness was permitted
5 to state that Dr. F. J. "Gale of New
town visited the prisoner in the lock
up, the state successfully opposed an
answer to the question of whether Dr.
Gale or not gave the prisoner anything
at the time. , .
. Two witnesses were heard today
upon the question of the number of
gunshot wounds probably inflicted
upon the body of Mrs. Haines. Dr.
George B. Garlick of 474 State street,
a city physician and Dr. E. B. Weld on.
of 327 Broad street, of the emergency
hospital, both of whom were present
at the autopsy, declared that in their
opinion three shots were fired into the
body. The left arm, which was-partially
shattered by shot, they declared,
could not have been raised in a posi
tion to permit the arm and the.Jaody

All of Fairfield county and some of
New Haven county will be included
in a campaign for better things to be
launched this spring. Preparations
are under way. Derby, which has
several factories employing women, is
likely to be among the first affected.

ment on the conviction-of her hus
band on the charge- of murdering
County Commissioner Hubert Case of
Barkhamsted. Unless a reprieve is
granted, Williams and Harry Roe will
hang promptly after midnight.
Mrs. Williams is a Western girl. She
has a calm and poise and quiet confi
dence that explains her courage in dis
regarding the Jibes of her girl friends
In the West when she answered a mar
riage bureau advertisement ; and set
out for the East to oecome a mail or

Her handsomeness is marred by two
spots of deep v blue- under her eyes.
While she shows no emotion, her -face
betrays the fact that she has spent
many a sleepless and . tearful night
since- the arrest of her -husband.
"The state made a mistake," Mrs.
Williams said today, without rancor.
''Just because a man has led a life like
Ike has is no reason why he should be
given so little chance.
"Deep in my heart I know he didn't
do it. He -lid those other things, and
he didn't have to tell about them if he
didn't want to, but'he told every sin
gle thing , to Mr. Shapiro. I'm sure
he would have told Mr., Shapiro, If he
had done what Jie is accused of."
Calmly, and without a trace of bit
terness, Mrs. Williams, said: "That
other lawyer double-crossed us. He
was supposed to be-worklng for us.and
he went back on us. "
"Why should he stand up there te
fore the board of 'pardons and say he
believed Williams was guilty? -I was
thunder-struck, and so was Mr. Shap
iro. What we think is that he made
Ike the 'goat' to save the Pfaefflins."
Mrs. Williams was referring to Ber

associated With Charles Slriro of this

Mrs. Williams and her sister-in-law,
Mrs. J.B. Williams, both of whom
are living at 477 Broad street, protest
much that they don't understand how i
their alibi could have been overridden.
Mrs. J. B. Williams says she met Isaac
Williams, Harry Roe and Frank Roe
on Water street, Poughkeepsie. during
the hour that the attack on Case was
made. The. state attempted to re
fute the statements of, Mrs.' J. B. Wil
liams on this matter. " .
"And I want to tell you another
thing," declared the condemned man's
wife today. "Teeth were found on Mie '
floor of the store. They weren't Ike's
and they weren't Harry Roe's. Case
didn't lose any. So, whose were they?
That's ' what Ike wants to know and .
that's what I want to know. j
"There's nothing that can be done
now. Mr.' Shapiro did his best and '
Ike has asked me to thank him. He ;
tried hard to save my husband."
Mrs. Williams will not return to
the West, she says. She has a position
here and will remain. Mrs. J. B. Wil

Isaac Williams has said good bye to

attorney or the common council.
Agents of Mr. PearsaJl have been very
busy for several months searching
records at the cltty hall.
. At present , the matter is in the
hands of the 'board of appraisal of
benefits and damages. The new
layout of Grovers avenue or Grovers
Hill road, as it is more familiarly
known to the old residents of the
Black Rock district, goes through
land which Mr. Pearsa.ll claims.
In return for this land, which it is
proposed to take, the common coun
cil has voted that Mr. Pearsall be
given the land over which' the old
road now runs. This will give him
possession of , all the ground from

It is said (that' Mr. Pearsall Js un
willing . to accept this arrangement
and that he is now endeavoring to es
tablish his title to all the property in
the vicinity and to close it to future
use by the public.

F acingr Delay in House, Leaders Plan to Have Anti-

ate Vote in Senate, Where Sufficient Strength
to Smash Resolution is Mustered Minority
Leader Mann to Confer With President on
Attitude of Republicans in House Democra
tic Leaders Have Another Meeting With Chief
Executive and Will Speed Legislation So That
Early Vote May Be Had.
Washington, March 2. Administration forces, faced;
with delay in the House, ' turned today to the Senate to
carry out President Wilson's demand for the defeat of
resolutions warning Americans off armed- ships of Euro
pean belligerents. v
Chairman Stone, of the foreign relations committee,
announcing openly from the floor that he was not in ac
cord with the President on the issue, proposed, however,
that the Senate take an adjournment instead of another
recess and-thereby get into a new legislative day, relieving
the parliamentary situation which thus far has held Sena
tor Gore's resolution from coming to a vote.
His action was taken after a conference of administra
tion leaders who were satisfied they had the votes to de
feat the Gore resolution and demonstrate to Germany that
the arguments against President Wilson's foreign policy
'db nojfc have the support of Congress.
"It has been decided to bring the resolution up for
action as soon as possible, but probably not today," said
Senator James, of Kentucky, one of the administration
supporters. "We have got the Votes in the Senate to
smash it."
President Wilson and Republican Leader Mann, of
the House, will disduss the attitude of Republicans on the
armed ship issue at 5 o'clock this afternoon at the Presi
dent's request. The President intends to place the issue
squarely before the Republicans in an effort to gain their
support.
- Senator "Stone
alt the outset of his
Di-ODosal. made a statement of the
international situation as he under
stood it.
"A sharp -issue has (been denned be
tween Germany and Great Britain as
to the status of armed merchantmen,
he. said. "Germany conltends that
armed merchant vessels are the equiv
alent of auxiliary war vessels and has
announced her policy to 'be that after
March 1 armed merchantmen would
be regarded as warships' and subject
to the duties of war.
"On the other hand, Great Britain
! contends 'that under intern aitional law
merchantmen have the right to be
armed for - defensive purposes and
that armed merchantmen are entitled
under the law to- the same immunity
as unarmed ships, without regard to
cargo. : She , has . announced her in
tention to carry out , that policy. .'
"That is the issue between . these
two governments. . .
"Now where does the United States
come in? In this way: . If both
persis tin these courses, neither yield
ing to each other, nor to the impor
tunities of - neutral nations, and if
Germany attacks an armed merchant
man and any American citizen is ini
jured .the' question is presented to
this . government what our attitude
would be; if tho American citizens
were on board we would have no
cause to interfere unless we proceeded
on the aitruisltlc theory of obligations,
of humanity.
"To my mind this emergency is of
high importance. The ' President,
Senators and Representatives should
speak , with each other and with the
public, free from political ibias ,We
should wear our hearts on our sleeves
so we 'may know our position exact-
"The President's attiltude Js this:
He supports the contention that bel
ligerent merchantmen have the right
to bear arras for defensive purposes
bu the does not say, nor do I, and I
doubt if anyone does, what consti
tutes defensive purposes.
"Furthermore, if a German warship
without warning should attack and
sink a merchantman, the President
proposes to consider the attack a law
less act. He will be disposed to hold
the German government to strict ac
countability and if the German gov
ernment persisted he would be tempt
ed to sever diplomatic relations and!
submit the n-".tter to Congress which,
under the constitution, is the war ma.
ing body. If it must come to this, i either house, to send any facts to Con
and I must disagree with the Presi- I gress or to appear before Congress in
dent, and if I must disagree with my i person as has been informally sug-
colleagues, I must not face this as a
political question. My duty is clear.
I cannot but believe that if a belliger
ent merchantman is armed, whether
for defensive or offensive purpose, if
it Is transporting war material it is
the equivalent of a war vessel.
"I cannot discuss t?ie question now
but will merely' state that . in duty"to
myself, to my constituents and to my
1 country, I will discuss here at length
in the near, future. The President is
opposed to the Gore resolution. He
Is not only oppposed to laws on the
subject but to any form . of official
warning, keeping people off belligerent
vessels.
"If I could have my way, I would
take some step to save this country
from becoming embroiled in the Euro
pean var through the recklessness of
some thoughtless citizen.
"The President has written Senator
Pou that the resolution has been . a
source of - embarrassment to him In
the diplomatic negotiations with the
'belligerents. I am sure that is so. I
have diligenltly sought to prevent res-'
olutions on this subject being adopted
and sought to allay agitation on this
sulbject. . Now we are informed that
the resolution must be defeated."
Senator Stone declared; It was his
hope that something could be done'
at once to bring the ' President ' and -Congress
more closely in accord on
the issue and that he. was framing a
substitute for all pending resolutions
on the" subject.
Senator Lodge, of Massachusetts, ,
ranking Republican , member of the
foreign relations committee, declared
he was in accord with Senator Stone's
desire .. for prompt action and he
agreed that the issue, was more im-.
portant thananything else now 'before
Congress. -
President Wilson told Chairman
Flood, of the House foreign affairs,
committee, early today. that he
would consent to no compromise on
the armed ship issue and desired a
direct vote on a resolution warning
Americans off armed ships of the bel
ligerent nations.
Mr. Flood took the President's de-1
cision to the committee.
Reports to the administration to
day were that yesterday 10 members
of the foreign affairs committee were
in favor of reporting out the McLe
more resolutions to warn Americans
off armed ships and nine members
were against it. . There are 21 mem-,
bers of the committee. Some of these
who expressed opinions were opposed
to the McLemore resolution because
it contains expressions not connected
directly with the issue on which the
President insists on voting.
A meeting of the committee which
was to have been held this morning
was postponed until 3 o'clock this af
ternoon, -when Chairman Flood will
deliver the President's message.
Up to the present, Mr. Wilson has
not been asked to see any committee of
gested. It wns said at the White
House that no such questions would
be taken up until they were presentf-d.
Administration officials character
ized the proposed vote of confidence as
a "soft soap" resolution to endorse tbe
President and at the same time warn
Americans off armed ships. They re
iterated that no such resolution would
