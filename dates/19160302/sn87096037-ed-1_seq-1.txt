Says Law Vlolatea Treaty.
Judge Pollock of the district court
at Fargo has handed down a decision
in the interesting inheritance tax case
of Howard Moody as executor of es
tate of Martin A. Hagen, deceased, ver
sus Hllha A. Skariirud, et al, appel
lant and the North Dakota tax com
mission, respondent, in which he held
that the state Inheritance tax law iu
assessing a larger tax against non-resi
dent alien heirs is unconstitutional
and iu violation of the treaty existing
between Norway and the United
States.
That this case will go to the su
preme court for final decision is as*
sured as it
!s
a most important case
and it is expected that the tax coin
mission will test it to the limit.
The portion of the inheritance tui
law in question is that section which
specifies that resident aliens have to
pay a tax of 1.5 per cent while non
resident aliens are assesed 25 per cent
of the inheritance.
Bliss Urges Better Roads.
There will be spent for the building

In the slate of North Dakota during
this coming season of lftlti. over two
and one-half million dollars. Slate En
gineer .7. W. Bliss urges that every
township and coupty board in the stat®
set aside a percentage of the amount
available for road dragging. Road
officials of any township or county ihat
has not already adopted a plan of sys^
tematic road dragging can be assure^
that money so spent it wisely spent,
ifi deed, for a "stitch in time saves
nine." Let the motto, their, for 1914
be "Build better roads and drag ail
Improved roads when they need it."
Time to Look Over Potato Bin.
This is the time of the year that the
potatoes should be looked over. Those
that show signs of disease if left In the
bin will Infect tbe potdloes near them.
Mr. Mllbrath of the North Dakota Ex
perimental station, explains below
how the diseased potatoes will look
and what to do with them.
Potatoes that have been stored even
under good conditions will now begin
to show indications of disease where
ever it la present. Diseases such as
wilt and stem rot were so prevalent
lrr the fields during the past s" miner
that It Is safe to state that there will
be some evidence of disease in almost
any bin.

principal speaker. The session
started in the morning at about

ing a splendid success from aa
eduoational standpoint was also

GOPHER STATE FIGURES
More Fords Sold in Minnesota in 1915
Than All the other MakeConlinwJ."
The census of Minnesota's
motor cars has just been com
pleted and includes practically
every car, of whatever makes,
actually running in that time. A
perusal of the figures reveals
some intersting facts.
There were 85,393 cars of all
kinds conditions included in the
count, which covered the period
from January 1 to November 1,
1915. The increase during this
period was 21, 208 cars, or thirty
three per cent, and it is hardly
surprising that 11,369 of these
cars were Fords. In other
words, there was a little better
than one Ford sold for every car
of all other other makes com
bined.
The really surprising feature
of the oensus was the fact that
over 46,000 of the state's cars
were in the hands of farm
ers, a percentage of 54 and
and the number of cars re
gistered from towns of less than
I,000 population was 37,000, the
total population of such towns
being under 200,000.
While the increase of Fords
II,369, the next nearest compet
itor has but 2,636 the second
had 2,545 and the third only
1,291. There are 30,708 Fords
in Minnesota, while the combined
cars of the four nearest compet
ing in rites totaled but 23,392.
