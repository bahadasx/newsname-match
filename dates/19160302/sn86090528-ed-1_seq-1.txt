By Vnited Press.
WASHINGTON, D. C. March 2.
President W ilson, it is understood, has
decided to apply his watchful waiting
policy to the present situation, grow
ing out of the controversy in regard
to warning Americans to avoid armed
merchant ships, leaving it to eongre s
and the country to fight it out. Ma
believes that the sentiment of the
country will swing congress to his way
of thinking about the matter.
It Is reported that the president
told Chairman Flood of the house com
mittee on foreign affairs that he doe
not want any compromise resolution
that would do anything short of clear
ly establishing how congress stands to
ward himself and the present situa
tion. To bring about a complete under
standing the president wants congress
to vote on one resolution, such as that
of McLemore, warning Americans not
(o travel on armed merchantmen. It
Is the desire of the chief executive
that the members of congress go on
record as to how thev stand on the
policy of the administration in regard
to armed merchant ships.
l'p to noon today no decision had
been reached by the house committee
on foreign affairs as to what course
will be pursued. It is known that the
ronate is ready to asquiesce in the
president's wishes, hut if is admitted
that there Is a possibility of the
house falling- to fall in line with his
suggestions
BEETS BEGINS
TO COLLECT TAX
Dan I'eets, commisisoner of streets,
has commenced the collection of the
street tax for the present year. Mr
Beets states that payments of this
tax are coming in in a most satis
factory manner and urges that all who
are interested in seeing the streets
of the city made the best of any city
in Southern Oklahoma to keep up the
good work. The street tax for the
year, including the moneys paid in,
the sums worked out by team and the
amounts worked out "single-handed"
w ill approximate $3,500. This amount,
judiciously expended, will go far to
ward the upkeep and the general beau
tification of the streets, avenues and
alleys.
In speaking of thei payment of ilic
street tax. and in referring to the
amounts which will be paid the city in
labor, Mr. Beets urged the necesity
of many of those who desire working
out their tax to send tetms. Several
teams. Mr. Beets claimed, could be
T'sed advantageously at almost any
time while the street work may be go
ing on.

Boyce Outlines Plan for Vocational Army
Schools; Scheme Endorsed by Presi
dent Wilson in Speeches on
Western Trip
By United Press.
CHICAGO, March 2. Au outline oi
how his proposed vocational army
training school plan, endorsed by
President Wilson, may be economically
efficiently and quickly started through.
Ottt the country, has been written by
V. D. Boyce of the Boyce publications.
I In brief, Mr. Boyce suggests that a
vocational and army training school
he added to each state college under
federal aid and guidance. Concern
ing the plan, President Wilson, in his
recent western trip, said in part:
"V.'e ought to have in this coui.try
a great system of industrial and voca
tional education, under federal guid
ance; and it will be perfectly feasible
and highly desirable to add to that
and combine with it such training in
the mechanism and use and care of
aims, in 'he sanitation of the camp,
in the simpler forms of maneuver and
orgaBizaticu, as will make these same
i rien industrially and individually serv
iceable for national defense.
"The point about such a system will
be that Its emphasis will lie on the in-
! dustrial and civil side of life, so that
men will think first of their families
and daily work and their services If
the economic fields of the country, and
r.nly labt of all of their serviceability
to the nation as soldiers and men at
arms That is the ideal of America."
Mr. Boyce in part says:
"To start the army vocationa1
schools, all that Is necessary is iw
United States army trp'ning barracks
(for drilling and living purposesrto be
added to the state colleges with a corps
of ml'itary instructors, equipment, etc.,
all of which can easily be provided by
the federal government. All the ex
penses of this addition must me borne
by the United States, which furnishes
hoard, lodging and clothing for tho
young men who take the course. The
r.overnment does this In exchange for
the student's services while he is -ing
trained to be a fit soldier. The
Flute furnishes the instruction in the
trade, profession or occupation w-hich
the student elects to take. He is put
to no expanse and he remains in the
vocational army school two years, or
more, going to his classes like say
student in a college, but being under
regular army discipline and living in
barracks. After his graduation he is
tuhject to the call of the United
States government for military serv
ice, but he goes into the trade, pro
fession or occupation In which he
has been Instructed and in which he
is a finished product.
"We have frequently called attention
to the fact that 85 per cent of the
hovs of the United States are obliged
lo go to work to support themselves
at the finish of their common school
education, going without the vocatiou
El training which they want and need.
The vocational army schools would
give every boy, whether his parents
are poor, well to-do or rich, an equal
chance to get a practical education and
at the same time fit himself to help de
fend his country.
"The federal government, would bo
doing only vhat it now doe3, in fur
niching military instruction, board and
equipment to its regular soldiers, and
at half expense, for it would not pay
salaries to the students. The states
would be doing only what they should
do, in furnishing educational facilities
for their citizens. The young men at
tending the vocational army schools
would not be kept out of productive
vcrk, as ti e regular soldiers are. When
the soldier goes back to civilian life,
h's productive capacity Is not inereas
ed, but when the graduates of the vo
cational army schools go into their
trades, occupations and profesbions,
their productive capacity and earning
ability will be increased many fold.
"I'nder the vocational army school
plan, 00 per cent of the youths of the
United States would become fit nin to
defend their country in time of need."

VOLUNTEER PILOTS
FOR BIG SHIP SHY
Democrats Leary of Entering Lists Against
Wilson and Shdow of Big Moose
in Background Keeps Repub
licans Guessing
By United Press.
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 2.
Washington is wondering what has be
come of her wandering boys. "Tha
boys" usually show up in January pre
ceding a piesidential election, loadeu
with campaign buttons, speeches and
imperishable literature favoring some
candidate who is not only willing but
anxious to save his country from the
wolves of the opposition.
Four years ago there was a notable
reunion of "the boys." Taft and Boose
telt overshadowed most other candi
dates on the Bepwblican side, but In
the Democratic field the race was open
'o new entries right up to convention
time .and the entries came thick and
fast to the last minute. Every night
or sc some new candidate took a fly
ing dive into the heap of self-sacrificing
heroes willing to give up their
important private affairs to serve the
puh'.lc.
Wilson, Clark? Harmon, l.'nderwood.
Gaynor, a host in fact, put themselves
in the hands of their friends. Few
were the hotels that could not beast,
or could but admit, they were head
quarters for some one or eighteen of
the candidates.
Washington was headquarters for ex
and prospective office holders, public
ity men and press agents. At any time
after 2 o'clock in the afternoon an out
sider who braved the storm of argu
ment that enveloped the cob-webby
interior of the historic bar where
solons and other gather could per
buade himself that the presidential
chair would have to bo a community
affair, and tho White House turneel
into an apartment building to accom
modate the "can losers" who were
fc-oing to b-i elected.
But this year "the boya" have not
shown up.
Those of the Democrats who would
be willing to succeed Mr. Wilson as the
pilot of the ship of state are hanging
bashfully in the background waiting
for encouragement that doesn't, at tho
present time, seem 'likely to arrive.
I'ntil Theodore Boosevelt is down In
black and white and up in arms, until
his hat is in the ring and his big
stick swinging, or until he is definite
ly settlPd the other way. many of the
Republican martyrs who would be will
ing to run and save the United States
are likewise hanging back.
It looks rather bad for the oy
It takes some time to launch a good
publicity bureau. Unless they get an
early start, the succession of primar
ies makes impossible tho important
erly claims :o the several states.
Any evening In February, 1912, for
instance, a credulous reader would
have had to 6hoot dice with himseU
to find which of ten candidates could
he believed when he proved absolutely
and without fear of successful con
tradiction that he would get the solid
delegation to Baltimore or Chicago.
Few persons in Washington know
just what is wrong this year. Tb
boys do not affect any one very much
except the hotel proprietors, the res
tuurteurs and" the several hundred
newspaper corespondents. Principally
the newspaper correspondents.
Tt was a sad day in the old years
when a newspaper correspondent
didn't get enough campaign literature
to paper a room largo enough to houso
most of the presidential aspirants. And
this is a sad year: but so far. thev
have managed to bear up under the
strain. "
this fun. We will endeavor to finish
setting the boulevard in trees this tall
as we still will need something: near
200 trees to make It complete.
Respectfully wbmitted.
