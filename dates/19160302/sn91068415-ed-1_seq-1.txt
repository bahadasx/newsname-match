Vote Tuesday
Willing to Trust The People
The editor of the Review is still
of the opinion that the bond issue
will not carry Tuesday and it is just
as well to so state now as afterwards
We are also not inclined to believe
that the outside world will censure
High Point if she fails to make the
$50000 issue available at present.
In every movement there are exten
uating circumstances. All can not
eee alike and therefore we best know
our conditions; the "outside world'
is not in a position to censure or
commend every time. High Point
will go forward nevertheless and
will continue to do so, it matters
not whether the issue be for or
against at this particular time. I
Those who will vote against the
issue we are said enough to believe !
will have a good, plausible excuse
the same as those who vote for the
measure.
The voters of High Point are sen
sible people and need not be told or
coerced as to how they should vote.
We are willing to leave the matter
entirely with them.
Over One Thousand Re
gistered Over 1,000 people have registered
for bond election next Tuesday as
follows:
First ward, 282, second ward, 175;
third ward, 245; fourth ward, 346.
Some of the registered voters were
challenged and the hearings will be
held this week.

If any one after the election ac
cuses us of the very same thing we
now acknowledgers true in regard
to our streets there will be a scrap

the deplorable conditions of our
streets.

BAD FIRE TUESDAY NIGHT
Rankin Coffin and Casket
Co. Sustains a $20,000 Loss
with Less than $5,000
Insurance
Tuesday night a few minutes be
fore nine o'clock an alarm of fire,
was turned in from fthe Southern
Power Co's box, the location of the
fire being at the Rankin Coffin and
Casket Co., nearby. The fire had
gained considerable headway by the
.time the firemen arrived and owing
to the inflammable material in the
buildings made a stubborn resis
tance. The machinery rooms, en
gine and boiler rooms and dry kiln !
of the company were a complete
loss. Capt. A . M. Rankin, the active
manager, estimates the loss at $2Cf
000 with only $4,500 insurance.
The big dry kiln contained 75,000
feet of lumber valued at $2,500 and
the machinery rooms were over
stocked with material, at least three
months ahead; this is what makes
the loss so heavy. The finishing
department escaped destruction.
Capt. Rankin says that the burned
buildings will in all probability be
rebuilt at once. About fifty hands
are thrown out of employment by
the fire. Only a few months ago
the High Point Casket Co. was de
stroyed by fire, the one burning last
night being the only factory of its
kind here since the other one did
not rebuild. It is understood that
the Rankin Coffin and Casket Co.
was doing a good business. It was
established in 1903.

Long won the prize (a crepe de
chine handkerchief) 'for the girls and
Master Hal Reynolds, the prize (a
book) for the boys. Pink and white
wished Miss Smith many happy re
turns on her 11th birthday and de
parted for their homes, feeling good
over the 2 hours spent at the party.

Bond Questio;
ABOUT INCREASE IN TAXES
Dear Editor Review:
They tell us every time a bond
issue comes up that it will not in
crease taxes yet cur taxes have in
creased greatly during the times we
have been voting bonds. Pray tell
us from where does the revenue
come to pay the interest on the
bonds if it doesn't come from in
creased taxes. How could we take
care of the interest on a half million
dollars worth of bonds with the tax
rate the same as fifteen years ago
and yet all this time the same story
has been told.
It looks like the city is spending
quite a lot of money through the
- and otherwise to carry
these bonds and who eventually f
pays for all this if not the poor tax
payer," win or loose? . .
Why not compare High Point with
some other town, and why confuse
streets with sidewalks when making
comparisons?
The people can be fooled part of
the time but I trust not all of the
time. '
"WISDOM"
WILL THEY COME, ASKS WRITER
Edittor Review:
Next Tuesday the voters of High
Point have before them a $50,000
bond issue for streets, which if vot
ed will place in the hands of the
present city officials the sum of
$145,000 siuce June 1st or in 9
months, all told.
The .an. of $60,000 was granted I
by the legislature when it named our
present city officials for us, instead
of by vote.
TEN THOUSAND, FIVE HUN
DRED DOLLARS was secured a
little later for school purposes and
about three months ago TWENTY
FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS was
secured, making $95,500 secur
ed in six months without a vote of
the people and having secured all
they can get without seeing the legis
lature again the dear voter is now
asked to come to the rescue.
Will they come? I believe not
for most of my , friends and neigh
bors are going to vote against them
and I hear this is the cafe' all over
the city.
Where will it benefit any working
man in High Point? It is the poor
working man they generally ring in,
you know. U. SHOWME
THE BOND ISSUE
Editor The Review:
Now that the registration books
are closed and the election on bonds
will be held next Tuesday, it is
proper to ask something about the
proposed bonds.
On what streets will the money
be spent? The voter is in the dark
and doesn't know if it is the inten
tion to spend the money on the
Johnson property, North Main
street or where?
As we were disfranchised at the
last election time, in that the will
of the people was thwarted by an
act of the legislature, who "voted
things'' over our protests, why not
,ot the city officials go before the
1 jislature again and ask them to do
our voting again on this bond
issue. From what I can learn
it looks like this will eventually be
the result.
Tte small sura of money ($50,000)
will not go very far and I do not con
sider it unpatriotic to vote for what
1 consider a waste of money in such
matters.
Why not make the amount large
enough to insure good ttreets all
over the citv. say what the tax in
crease will be, and then put it
squarely up to the voters, who will
then not sit in the dark but will know
just what to expect, in other words
light on the matter! Guilford county
decided'not to fix part of the road
between here and Greens6oro each
vear but to finish it all at once.
' Just so with the city The interest
on the required money would be
easier to pay each year on the whole
amount than to fix a few feet of
street each year and then call for
a. bond issue every year or so.
"consistent:'
LIKE SLAVES LED BY THE
HALTER
Mr. Fditor.
As you will remember the voters
of High Point were disfranchised in
the last election, because the legisla
ture would not let us exercise our
rights as freemen but deliberately
granted a set of -men everything
they asked and made us live under
it.
iw t niDtju unruly itj.ajj.1 tt Livj
were responsible for this damable
state of affairs ask- us to come up
and vote for bonds (because the
legislature is not' in session so they
can get them) like SLAVES LED
BY THE HALTER, after they would
not let us vote on our own officials
and kind of government desired.
The above is enough TO CAUSE
ANY ONE TO VOTE AGAINST THE
BONDS, but if the amount of mon
ey now desired would accomplish
anything definite, then there might
be mitigating circumstances.
I have heretofore voted for bonds
but please excuse me this time.
