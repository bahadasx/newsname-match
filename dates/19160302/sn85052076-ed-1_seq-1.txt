Or
Alcohol and Pneumonia
The United States Public Health Service brands
strong drink as the most efficient ally of pneumonia. It
declares that alcohol is the handmaiden of the disease
which produces ten per cent, of the deaths in the United
States. This is no exaggeration. We have known for
a long time that indulgence in alcoholic liquors lowers
the individual vitality and that the man who drinks is
peculiarly susceptible to pneumonia. The United States
Public Health Service is a conservative body. It does
not engage in alarmist propaganda. In following out
the line of its official duties it has brought forcefully to
the general public a fact which will bear endless repeti
tion. The liberal and continuous user of alcoholic drinks
will do well to heed this warning, particularly at this sea
son of the year when the gruesome death toll from pneu
moia is being doubled.
Revival Meetings Close
Knit ht of Jamestown Cets.tho Crowd. Fino RoiulU
That Berea student are lovers of
strong preaching Is shown by the
treat throngs that filled the collet
chapel to hear the positive, logical,
and forceful sermons of the Rev.
Ernest Knight of Jamestown, N. Y,
the revival preacher for this year.
To the appreciative account of the
meeting In the College Column of
last week, the Revival Committee
wish to add an expression of grati
tude to the preacher for his labors
and of thankfulness for the re
sults.. A solid foundation of doctrine was
laid by the sermons of the first
nights, which, followed by strong
appeals, moved many to the great
derision for a Christian life.
The invitations given by our Rev.
Charles S. Knight who worked most
successfully with his brother, re
sulted in large response by the
students. It was a most Inspiring
sight to see groups of Ave and ten
young people eome forward led by
some friend, and take a publio posi
tion as seekers after God.

ciently by Miss Carmen at the plana

made the singing a marked aid to
the success of the meetings.
MIGRATORY BIRD LAW

I
Washington, D. O A misleading
statement has recently become cur
rent in newspapers of the Mississippi
Valley and elsewhere, to the effect
that the Department of Agriculture
has suspended the enforcement of
the Federal regulations under the
Migratory Bird Law and by this
means has enabled sportsmen, under
Slate laws, to shoot wild fowl the
coming spring.
Under the Federal regulations as
they now stand, the season on all
migratory wild fowl is closed until
next autumn throughout the United
States. Federal inspectors and war
dens are required, and others Inter
ested in the protection of wild fowl
are requested, to report to the De
partment of Agriculture all cases of
.violations of the regulations, in or
der that proper action may be taken.

The great event of the week has
been the German drive to break the
French line that defends the ap
proach to Paris. It was reported at
first that this effort was successful
in making important gains in com
ing closer to the strong fortress at
Verdun. Later reports indicate that
the Oermans were not able to hold
the ground gained. The movement
was under the lend of the Crown
Prince and the Emperor himself was
watching the drive.
The Russians have captured an
other city in Persia called Ker
manshah. It marks a gain for the
allies In the eastern side of the war
as it brings the Russians consider
ably nearer the English forces In the
valley of the Tigris River and ren
der, cooperation possible In the near
future.
The Russian legislative body, the
Duma, is opening its sessions. This
the the the the the the the the the
part of the Russian government was
created about ten years ago after
long and hard effort on the part of
the people. It will be possible to
gain a better idea of the sentiment
of the Russian people toward the
war through expressions of mem
bers of this body. It will also be
possible to see whether it is to be
come a real force in life of Russia or
stifled by the Czar in his war policy.
March 1st is the date set by the
flerman government for carrying In
to effect its recent order to destroy
all armed merchant vessels of its
enemies without warning. It brings
the long standing differences of the
United States and Germany to a
crisis. The situation is more com
plicated because the President and
his cabinet are standing strongly
for an enforcement of all the legal
rights of Americans on the sea,
while the two house, of Congress
seem disposed to favor a Resolution
that Americans be warned from
travelling on armed vessels, regard
less pf legal rights.
Germany has outlined a policy of
taxation which is expected to meet
the interest on her great war debt
which has risen to over six thousand
millions of dollars. The chief fea
ture of this system is the
plan to make the industries that are
profiting by the war bear the bur
den of the tax by a very heavy rate
on the profits earned during the
war. It is part of the plan also to
prevent, by various devices, the
, evasion of the tax even by those
who seek to do so by moving from
the Empire.
The people of Ireland are much
displeased with England's method of
1 cutting down expenses for the pur-
of revenue. Ireland's taxes
have risen from eleven million dol
lars to seventeen which she stands
without complaint. The cutting
down of appropriations for the Na
tional Library, the Academy of Mus
ic, the Agricultural Education, the
Fund for encouragement of breed
ing fine stock has touched Ireland at
a sensitive spot since she has been
making such rapid progress along
these lines.
Conditions in Mexico are becom
ing more settled. It is encouraging
to note that she is making great
progress in the line of health bet
terment Typhus and other epidemic
diseases have been raging during
the months of revolution. They
are now under control and the
