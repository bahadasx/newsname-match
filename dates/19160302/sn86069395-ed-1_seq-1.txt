She hunted appellations

When they christened him at last:

But after all the trouble
She'd taken for his sake,
His father called him Fatty,
And his schoolmates called him

INSURANCE BILL IS PASSED
Representative Harvey Is Still
Asking For An Investi
gation. Frankfort, Ky., March 1. At the
urgent request of Republican mem
bers, both branches of the general
assembly have adjourned until Thurs
day morning. The adjournment is to
permit members of the minority to
attend the state convention of their
party at Louisville tomqrrow. Many
Democrats also will visit the Repub
lican gathering.
The Huffaker substitute for the
Glenn insurance bill passed the senate
31 to 1, Montgomery casting the dis
senting vote. In explaining his vote,
Senator Frost said he cannot indorse
ail that is in the bill, but thinks that
some insurance legislation is neces
sary" on account of the drastic legis
lation passed by the last general as
sembly along that line. Since that
time the insurance companies, he
said, have been working under a flag
of truce, and if some kind of legisla
tion is not passed, that truce will bo
withdrawn and the insurance com
putes probably will withdraw from
the state.
Although voting for tho measure,
Senator Stricklett "said it is too favor-able-
for insurance companies. In
fact, he said, it is just as favorable to
the insurance companiesyis the bill
passed twoycars ago wns favorable"
to the insurer. The IufFaker bill,
Senator Stricklett said, appeared to
him to be gotten up for the benefit of
the insurance companies. -
The bill to provide for interest
bearing state warrants with specified
date of maturity, after being amend
ed, passed unanimously. The amend
ment added was offered by Senator
,Combs, who explained that it was
drawn by the general counsel ot the
federal reserve board to permit- tho
federal reserve banks to compete for
suite warrants. Under tho bill, as
drawn, tho federal banks could not
be competitors, he said.
Representative W. B. Harvey i of
Webster county, again demanded tiiat
hq be given 11 "square deal" and an
immediate investigation of the charges
against his moral character be made.
A fellow member of the house, J. D..
Pumphreys, of- Fleming comity, said
that Harvey had made an attack on a
chambermaid at the Capital hotel.
It is probable the committee of six
divided equally between friends of
Harvey and Pumphrpys will proceed
with the investigation without naming
a seventh, man, as" neither seems able
to agree on a referee.

Germans Report Capture of
228 Officers, 16,575 Men and
Large Number of Guns.
JOFFRE HOLDING HIS OWN
Russia Tells of Frightful
Slaughter of Turk's in Forts
of Erzerum.
London, March 1. With the les
sening of the activity of the contend
ing forces to the north of Verdun, the
French in the Woevre region, cast of
Verdun, are using their artillery to
break up German preparations for
further advances toward the fortress.
At various points the fire of the
French guns has prevented the Ger
mans from launching offensives.
In the Vosges mountains there also
Iihs been great artillery activity by the
French near Senones and Ban-de-Sapt;
while near Seppois the Germans
have been driven out of trenches
they had previously taken. In the
Champagne, the German fortiticd
works in the region of hill 193 have
been battered by the French guns and
the crater of a mine exploded by the
Germans was occupied by the
French.
The Germans have added scvenl
additional points to their terrain in the
Verdun, having been enabled to con
struct trenches on tlte slopes north of
the Cote du Poivre and to capture an
armored work northwest of Douau-
mont, and have taken the towns of
Manheulles and Champion, thirteen
niiles southeast of Verdun.
In tins tlnve to the west of Verdun,
the advance of the Germans has ex
tended over a front virtually twelve
miles from Dieppe to Champion.
Berlin reports that thus far they
have taken prisoner 228 officers, ld,
557 men and a large number of guns,
machine guns and much war niatci tal.
There has been considerable aitil
lery activity and fights in the air be
tween battalions of German aud Brit
ish aviators, along the British tr r.t in
France and Belgium.
In the Dvinsk region of Russia, the
Russians have driven the Germans
back and advanced their line, and put
down under heavy fire an attempt att
a counter attack. "
In a lengthy statement, in replj to
an official communication issued from
Constantinople, the Russian gi-uend
start" describes the powerful defenses
which guarded Erzerum, and de
clares that the forco of the blow dalt
by the Russians am be estimated by
the fact that some of the Turkish army
corps of three divisions each now
number only a few thousand, all the
remainder having either perished or
been taken prisoner.
Details are lacking concerning the
disaster to the French auxiliary cruis
er Provence, which has been lost in
the Mediterranean. While the French
ministry of marine estimates the num
ber of survivors at 870, no estimate is
made of tho casualties.
