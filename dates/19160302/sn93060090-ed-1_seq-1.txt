Feb, 28th. 1916:.
The tension between the
president and Congress over the
submarine situation with Ger
many has lessened. At the
same time it is apparent tnat
the party difference have not
been entirely smoothed over.
The Capital generally belives
that President Wilson will find a
way out of the apparent empasse
in the German controversy.
The present great national
anxiety springs from differences
of opinion concerning the defini
tion of tide word unarmed,
Arguments are beard in all
quarters concerning the nuUiti

Word comes to Washington
that Germany counts upon the

Realities Of life,
"Life is rea),v life "is earnest,
And the crayf is not the goal:
"Dust thou ar'tf to du.-t feturnest'
Was not sprta-n of the soul."
Those words of Longfellow!
How true thev Hn(?! r.ifo i
real? Yes life is real
so very
real But is it the- sad things of
of this life which are res,)? Or
again. Is it the jo.vs of this7 life
wbicb are mo-st real? What part
of life is it that is truly real?
When the mother sees her
babe laid to. rest in the cold
ground and the god thrown a
bove that little lifeless form, do
you suppose that mother would
call that any thing less than rual
sorrow? r Bat Dear bereaved
Mother, is it truly a sorrow after
all? To be sure, your arms are
left empty Silence now reigns
where once was babish prattle,
and laughter, ' the little cradle
and high chair are empty, But
is that little babe worseloff for
that? No. No Dear Mother, that
little babe was nure and innn-
cent, he was prepared to tro. and
Oh! the snares, the temptation,
tire sorrow, the sickness, the
suffering and heart aches which
he has escaped!
Mother would you brine him
back here, to ibis sinful world?
No, I dont believe vou would!
Nil Mother, if you belie vein God
and the salvation of His Son
Jesus, this should not be a real
ci r hat sorrow.
What then arc the real sor
rows of lite, if it isn't the death
of our loved ont's?
Why, Dl'iu' Fathers and Moth
ers, Sisters and Brothers, this
death, of which wo are sptaking,
is only tbc first death, the sever-!

There are other things in life
which are not real sorrows, but
are rightly named trials. But
when we have trials' let'.us turn
to Peter's words in 1st. Peter 12
-12- "Beloved,, think it not
strange' concerning the tio.ry
trials which are to try you, as
tbo some strange thing happen
ed unto you; but rejoice, in as
much.fls ye are partakers of
Christ's sufferings i that when
His glory shall be revealed, ye
may he glad also with exceeding
joy." ,
But why dwell so long on the
sorrows of life? God has not
only given us many blessed
promises and words of encour
agement in His Holy Book: but
He has also given us a sermon in
every phaue of nature, Evry
leaf and blossom, every blade of
grass, every glint of sunshine,
sends forth a message of Divine
love and mercy and speaks of
the loving kindness of our God.
Everj one of you have seen
days when there were big scuds
of c'ouds passing swiftly or
slowly as the case may be, a
cross the blua sky. If you no
tioed the land-scape, you seen
that where you stood was dark
ened by clouds while just across
yonder, on the hillside or mead
ow the sun was shining brightly.
But did it stay that way? No.
If you looked again, you seen the
shade whioh enveloped you, roll
back and give place to the sum
which a moment ago was shining
so brightly on that other hill or
meadow. While that said hill
or meadow is enveloped in shade
oy the next drifting cloud. So
it is in life. The clouds in the
sky of life are constantly drift
ing by, 'eaving shade and sun
shine in their path.
But God is just. And no matter
what the pessimest any tell you
each home has its portion of
shade and sunshine, Sometimes
a cloud drops some rain as it
passes over our homes, but
sorrow in our hearts is like
raindrops on the parched fields.
It only serves to freshen and
revive.
Also If we will look we are
sometimes rewarded by seeing
a tiny rift in our cloud where
the- sun may peep thru. So
instead of repining let us look
for the "rift in the clouds,'' for,
"There's a rift in the cloud,
There's a light breaking thru,
Catch a glimpse, weary eyes,
Of the fair peaceful blue.
Tho' the raindrops may falF,
There is sunshine for all,
As imaiorla! and sure,
As God's infinite Love. "

MOTHEP.S.
It was a Boston child, t
course, who said when soca-.
body asked her what she consid
ered mothers good for. .,
"Why. vou see, God coulden'b-be
everywhere, and so he just had
to make mothers."
Eutit takes grace to be a
good motaer now doesn't .it?
She naust be wise and patient
and good natured aad serene
and always ready to domfo'rt
and help without losing hor self
control. Prof. Swing once said
he knew many mothers whose
children where well washed,
well scolded, well dressed, aod
well whipped, but few whose
children were inspired and it
certainly taites grace to leed
such a life before the children
that they shall be inspired.
If you have good, healthy
children, full of animal spirits
and rollicking with fun and life
be thankful for it even if they de
. make more noise some times
tban it seems possible to bear;
for a weak and nervous child is
tenfold more of a problem.
There are two general types
of nervous children: jThe active
child always on the go, inquis
itive, and acquisitive, but deli
cate as the mimosa leaf shrink
ing back into itself at the first
repuise or narsh word and the
pale q uiet affective child, thought
ful, responsive, reserved. The
child of the first type may be
the embryo philanthropist or
leader of criminals, inventor or
social iconoclast,-as bis training
tends, while the child of the sec
ond type develops into the
philosopher, the poet, the manor
letters, or the misanthrope, the
recluse, the anarchist, as the
case may be. One of the great
esc mistake in training a
nervous child is to think that
strength can come thru opposi
tion. Such a child should be
guided, not driven: If afraid of
the dark, it should not be forced
to sleep in an unlighted room.
Timidity fhould not be
ridiculed, but patiently explained
and argued away.
Few ptople realize how impor
tant it is to have sunshine in the
house. We must have fresh air
they say and ihVow open the'
doors. But tho sWs rays must
be kept out. It W fade the
carpet. So they ktp the shut
ters shut and the cii ains down.
What tnufct be the ' mdUion of
a room which is kepfyOark? But
it is just as true of artt.ndividual
that sunshine is just at wessary
to keep us in a healiLful state
aod capable of scattering smiles
as it is for a house to have both
heat and light, in order to make
it healthful.
Sunlight is a substance; so is
the sunlight of the sou). We
need not manufacture either.
What the natural sun is to the
earth, the Lor is to the soul.
We need to open the shutters
by putting away ever selfish and
worldly thought: we need to tell
up the curtains that separate us
from the neighbor's welfare.
