News comes to us that the
people of Caruthersville have
formed or about to form a fair
association, capitalized at S 1.1.000,
half paid up. and assessing Ithe
shares at $23.00 each, making
provision that each vote of stock
holder shall be the same. That
is, one person holding one share
has the same vote in its'affairsjas
the person owning twenty-five
shares. We are glad to see the
people of the county waking up
to the interest of agriculture, as
nothing is a better promoter for
tins industry than a good live
fair.
