position "in which President Wilson-has lately been placed
by elements in Congress.
Senator Williams spoke in the course of a debate
which suddenly broke out over the foreign situation and
the armed merchantman controversy.
The House is still marking time. The scheduled
meeting of the Committee on Foreign Affairs this morning
was postponed until this afternoon at 3.
President Wilson this morning again served notice
that no compromise measures will be accepted, He reiter
ated his demand that Congress have a flat "showdown" on
the question of warning Americans off armed merchanlf
liners. He refused to cpnsider a vote of confidence.
The President this afternoon receive da complete re- "

TO SEEK REPUBLICA NSUPPORT. j '
President Wilson has decided to seek Republican ip
port in h: seffort to force Congress to take definite action -fo
ra defeat of the legislation warning Americans off aimed
liners.
Af te rthe conference with McAdoo he called up Jkmes
R. Mann, the House minority leader, by telephone,and" '
asked the Republican leader to call on him at the White
House at 5 o'clock this afternoon. M
Although it was expected the Senate today wouldW
ahead discussing the water power bill, the internatiofial
controversy suddenly flared up when Senator Stone, cMr;
man of the Foreign Relations Committee read a carefmly
jjicpiircu siaiement to tne senate i nwhich, after defining
tne aimuae or tne President and his own attitude, he urgfed
that some plan be adopted for Congress and the Executive
to come to a closer understanding.
