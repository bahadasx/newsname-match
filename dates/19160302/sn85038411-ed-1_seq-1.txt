From Heights
After a lull in Infantry operations in
the vicinity of Verdun since the early
part of the week there has been a re
sumption of tlie German offensive In
(he Woevre region. A violent bom
bardment was followed by a spirited
attack on the French at Fresnes, ten
miles southeast of Verdun. Paris re
ports the driving out of the Germans
irom the fow positions which they suc
ceeded in penetrating in their assault.
The offensive was reopened on the
plain of the Woevre. east of Verdun,
where the Germans have worked at
several points to the base of the
heights of (he Meuse, pausing before
the strong French position that crown
the ridge to the west of the plain.
In an apparent attempt to break
the French line near the southern end
of the 12-mile front along which their
recent advance in this region was
pressed, the Germans made a drive
on the French at Femes, ten miles
southwest of Verdun and succeeded
in pentrating the French positions at
some points. Paris, however, de
clares that they wore promptly ejected
in a counterattack.
The French themselves took the
offensive at Douaumont. four miles
northeast of Verdun, the outlying fort
captured last week by the Crown
Prince's Brandenburg troops and
since reported to be held by several
hundred Germans cut off through a
subsequent French advance. Herlin
announces that the attacks were fruit
less. only resulting in useless sacri
fices of French troops. The Herlin
statement does not mention the
Fresnes operation, the Verdun situa
tion being otherwise covered in the
general statement that conditions
along the Franco-Belgium front re
main unchanged.
May Spread Wont
West of the Mouse river, the Ger
mans are showing signs of renewed
activity, violently bombarding French
positions between Malancourt. ten
miles northwest of Verdun and Forges
H'/ii miles east of Malancourt, indicat
ing a possible spread of tiie line of
the Verdun attack to the west.
Outside of Verdun district the only
important happening recorded iii
either of the official statements was a
German attack in the Lorraln district,
west of Bezange, ten miles north of
l.uneville. which Paris declares was a
complete failure despite prolonged
artillery preparation.
British Artillery Active
There is possible significance in the
German announcement of intense
activity by the British artillery in the
Vser district of Belgium where mili
tary observers have forecast a possible
diversion by the British in aid of the
French further down the line.
The new attack gives ''olor to what
seems lo be, the prevailing military
opinion in Paris that the German
offensive at Verdun liad merely halted.
It also calls particular attention to the
Woevre region, where the Teutons

French Commander Holding Germans at Verdun
v J
GENERAL, HUMBERT
The you nicest .French general commanding an army in the field—General
Humbert—is having the chance at Verdun of gambling for the highest stakes
of military rpiiovrn! an opportunity to l>e envied by all his follow commander.!.
He was appointed tt> take charge of the forces in the Argonne. early last Fall,
succeeding General- Sarrail. who had come into conflict with General Joffre
and General MUlerand, then secretary of war.
General Sarrail was sent to Salonici and Humbert was chosen to oppose
the attacks which the German crown prince has beeit making against the
fortress at Verdun at intervals for a year and a half.
General Humbert was only a major when the war began, and his rapid
promotion has been due to his ability to carry out the plans of General Joffre,
who is now at Verdun directing the defense.

John Fox Weiss, formerly district
attorney and Republican county chair
man, definitely announced this morn
ing that he will not be a candidate for
the Republican nomination for State
senator at the May primaries. It had
been persistently rumored that he
would get into the race, but he put an
end to the reports when he cave the
following statement to the Telegraph:
"During the last six months I have
been requested by many representative
Dauphin < ountlans to become a candi
date tor the Republican nomination
for State senator, and have learned
from each what, to him. is undoubt
edly a valid reason why I should seek

"To all of these requests and reasons

eration, p.nd, while I deeply appreciate
the many proffers of loyal support
which have been given, I cannot see
my way clear to be a candidate."
This practically leaves the field open
for an unopposed renomination for
Senator K. IC. Beldleman. Senator

Strikers at Auto War
Order Plant Joined by
Workers on Aeroplanes
By Associated Press
Buffalo, N. Y., March 2. Five
hundred machinists of the Pierce Ar- j
row Automobile Company went out on |
strike to-day in response to the strike'
vote taken at a mass meeting of the
machinists' union. More than 1500 j
machinists remained at work. Only I
a small proportion of these men be
long to the union and it was con-1
sidered unlikely today that any con
siderable number would join the
strikers. The plant has large war
orders for motor trucks.
Two hundred of 900 employed at'
the Curtiss Aeroplane Company join-!
Ed the strikers. Several other small,
concerns were forced, to close when'
their machinists walked out. Union J
officials would not state how many
men had answered the strike call hut!
predicted that 10,000 would be af-'
fec-ted by Saturday.
They demand an eight-hour day, j
time and a half for overtime, no!
Sunday work and a Wage scale with
a minimum of forty cents an hour.
Members of the State Industrial (Com
mission and State Board of Media
tion and Arbitration are here in an i
effort to adjust the difficulty. 1
$300,000 MORTON
TRUCK ORDER ON
WAY TO RUSSIA
Shipping by Way of Seattle
Because of Blockade on
New York Lines
HELD WEEK IN YARDS
Finally Despairing of Ship
ment, Train Is Rushed by j
Route 5,000 Miles Further
The effect of the freight blockade
at the New York terminal of the
Pennsylvania Railroad, was shown
last night, when a train of 01 cars, ;
each car loaded with a Morton trac- \
tor, passed through Harrisburg en
route to Seattle, Wash., from where
they will be shipped to Russia.
Two weeks ago this shipment left I
Philadelphia for New York, and was
tied up in the yards of the metropolis
ever since.
The tractors are part of a war order
held by the Morton Truck and Trac
tor Company of Harrisburg. and
were built at the Baldwin Locomotive
plant, Philadelphia, on a subcontract.
The total value of the shipment is!
SBOO,OOO. Recently the local firm re
ceived notice to make the shipments
as rapidly as possible, and in view of
the fact that railroad officials are un
able to say how soon the present
blockade in the East will be lifted,
the Harrisburg Company believes
considerable time will be saved, by
the shipping west notwithstanding
that the route to Russia by Seattle is
5,000 miles further. Assurance Is
given that there will be a boat ready
at Seattle to take the shipment.
The Pennsylvania Railroad Is
handling this special train as pref
erence freight with instructions to
permit no delays at division term
inals. The train reached the Enola
yards last night at 6 o'clock and one
hour later was enroute West. Each
truck is in a large box which takes
up all the room on a gondola, 60 feet j
long. The special train was due at
Pittsburgh this afternoon. i
