ALL REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES NOMINATED
ADAMS DEFEATED BY ROSENTHAL FOR
CITY TREASURER.
On Wednesday of this week the voters of the city of Vale were given a chance
to try out the Primary System for the nomination of candidates for the varioua
city otlices. The fact that there were 316 voters out during the day plainly
shows that the people were in favor of the new style which supercedes the old.
fashioned feed barn 'demonstration." Promptly at the appointed time the
battle started and the fun waxed fast and furious all day. Neither side gave
up the ship until the ficht was over and the votes were counted. The people
seemed to understand the proposition for in the entire number of votes cast
there was not a spoiled ballot. As the Expositor predicted last week, Mclntyre
received the nomination.
The contest was a good natured one and the final returns showed that where
there was any opposition the first republican ticket won all down the line with
the exception of Adams who lost the nomination for City Treasurer to ltoseu.

THE COUNTRY FAIR
Thursday, Friday and Saturday of
last week were red letter days for cir
cles two and three of the, ladies of the
M. E. church. On those three days the
people of Yale were entertained with
a "Country Fair," in Central hall and
the large crowds which attended prove
that the ladies made a hit.
The weather man went band in hand
with Dame Fortune, and both smiled
upon the efforts put forth by the mem
bers of the two circles.
From the opening hour on Thursday
until the time for closing on Saturday
night, there was something doing
every minute, and the only regret was
that it was over too soon.
For weeks the committees in charge
have been scouring the city and sur
rounding country for relics, curios and
specimens, and they succeeded so well
that fanciers of these lines declare they
never saw a better exhibition.
The fruit and vegetable display was
away above par, as was also the show
ing of plants and (lowers.
The fancy work and hand painted
china was enjoyed by the ladies who
attended.
The pupils of our schools did them
selves proud in the display of work
turned out by the different grades, and
many favorable comments were beard
from all sides.
Many special attractions were of
fered, but the one which attracted the
most attention (from the men at lea6t)
was the self-serve commissary counter.
Real "fair" taffy was made and sold
on "the grounds" and it was one of the
best sellers.
The fish pond caught the eyes of
those who love to take chances, and
the remark has been going around
that certain city officials tried to buy
out the whole thing.
The ladies are well satisfied with the
patronage accorded them, 9116 being
added to their treasury.
Fox Chase and Horse Races
and
off at
J. F.
Wednesday was not only an exciting
day on account of the Primary Election
but it was doubly so with a fox chase
and horse races in the northern part of
the city.
A large crowd came from the sur
rounding country and nearby towns
to witness the fox chase
horseraces. The doings came
the Great Northern Hotel of
Crysler.
Between fifteen and twenty fox hounds
were here from Avoca, Melvin, Peck,
Mayville and our home dogs, nearly all
of them entering the chase. The first
prize was won by Conley's dog from
Avoca, second by Reeves dog and third
by the dog which won at Capac a week
ago.
The horse race was won by the liar
mer horse, second by Jas. Urown's
racer and third by Dougal McKay.
Everything passed off pleasantly
with no disturbances whatever. Mr.
Crysler is well pleased with the success
of the doings.

OBITUARY.
Emeline Cheney was born in Rlanch-
ford township, Canada, Feb. 18, . 1853,
and died at their farm home near
Alto, Mich., at the age of 61 years and
8 days.
She was united in marriage to James
Cooper in 1876. The greater part of
their married life was spent at l ale,
where she united with the Methodist
Protestant church.
She loved her church with a real af
fection, and was always happy when
it seemed imprudent for her to make
the effort.
Her loving thoughtfulness for others
was her chief characteristic and her
gentleness made her. great.
The beautifying inlluence of a pure
religion were spread over a life and
character as spotless and charming as
was ever possessed by any of the noble
women who have liyed and died during
ages gone.
As such a life was a blessing and
benefaction to all within the sphere of
its influence, so is death of such a one,
a public misfortune as well as a loss to
the home circle made desolate by her
departure.
It is difficult to pay tribute to one
who seemed born to inspire love and
respect.
Life will never be quite the same to
those who know her. While those
nearest her will long for her with un
utterable longing long for a mother's
counsel and advice and a wife's gentle
and loving sympathy.
The deceased is survived by her
aged mother, Mrs. Cheney of i'ale,
two bisters, three brothers, a hus
band, four daughters, Mrs. Philips, of
Detroit, Mrs. Teets, Mrs. Colvin, Miss
Ethel, a son, William, of Alto. One
daughter, Alice, aged 20, preceded her,
also one son having died in infancy.
"She will be misBed, but her smile
is now showered beyond."
Services were held from the Alto M.
E. church conducted by Rev. Chamber
lain. Jiurial in Elmwood cemetery,
Yale. Rev. Waldren Geach had charge
of the services here.
At length then, the tenderest of
mothers is gone !
Her Bmiles, her love accents, can
glad thee no more.
That once cheerful chamber is silent
and lone,
And for thee all a child's precious
duties are o'er.
liert Duflie, 52 years of age, died sud
denly at Four Gables, Edison Reach,
Port Huron, Wednesday evening, Feb.
24. He was born at Yale and resided
here until 1884 when his father, John
S. Duflie was elected register of deeds
of this county. He has since resided
in Port Huron and Detroit. A widow
and four children survive. The funer
al was held Friday last, interment in
Lakeside cemetery, Port Huron.

Feed Barn Changes Hands.
Four years ago the 15th of this month
Charles E. Martin purchased the 10
cent feed barn of John Ryno, since
which time he has conducted it suc
cessfully, giving every accommodation
to his patrons. This week a deal was
made whereby Wm. Sayles traded his
80-acre farm, located In Rrockway
township, just south of the city, for
the feed barn property, and will take
possession March 15th.
Mr. Sayles has been compelled to
give up the work of farming. He feels
that the work in the feed barn will
be enough to keep him out of mischief
and bring in a good revenue. We wish
him all manner of success in his new
undertaking.
Mr. Martin is not decided what he
will go at as yet, but in whatever busi
ness he may engage he has the best
wishes of the Expositor.
For Highway Commissioner '
- I have decided to again be a candi
