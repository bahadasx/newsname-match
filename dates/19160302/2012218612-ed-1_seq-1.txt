The Burning of Winnsboro
by Sherman.
The evening before Sherman's
army arrived in Winnsboro my
sister Mary and I were sent out
in the yard while my mother and
father secreted boxes, packed
with all kinds of goods, between
the floors and the ceilings of the
house. She was a little girl and
I was a little boy.. We were
afraid that the Yankees would
come and burn us out. Our par
ents were afraid that we would
be frightened ipto telling the
Yankees where the things were
tidden. While we were walking
up and down the lot we nbticed
a glare on the ground and turn
ing around my sister said, "Oh
my, they are burning Colambia!"
There was a red reflection that
went high up into the heavens
and seemed to meet from horizon
to horizon.
Sherman's soldiers arrived in
Winnsboro as my father was hav
ing morning prayer, and as I
started to kneel by my chair-It
being near a window-I looked
out and saw one of Sherman's
men knocking a panel out the
store door on the, corner diagno
ally situated from our dwelling.
This store I think at the time
was occupied by Mr. Hugh-Md
Master,. or Mr. Charlie Cathcart.
I saw 'them- an enter the store
and when I a from my chair
my mother asked e what was
the matter. I rep "Noth
ing." She said, 'I krw there
is; I know you are sick" Itod
her there was nothi.g wrong
withme. In a few econdsmy
father looked .out the widow
and-saw a Yankee. ,He shok
his head at my mother As-much
as to say, "There is the cause.
I di4tot hear his prayer h
monnmng.
We went down to
passr
having my father .t, whieb
hehad takenfrom thewardrobe.
My"atlieferept carefillyup be
hind -him and snatching the bat
fromithe knapsack *here the
soldier had it, 'sereed it under
his coat and walked alongside-df
the Yankee. The Yankee weit
to a desk out in my father's gin
shop and prizing it open with a
bayonet took a razor and a -box
of soap, my 'father at - the time
grabbing another razor. I re
member the YankIe,s remark; it
was this, "Well here is some soap
1it will kep me clean," and with'
that he walked out.~
My mother prevailed on my
father to ask some officeer for a
guard, and after a while a guard
was placed in our front porch.
Be was relieved at.eertain inter
vals by other guards. I sup
pose because of the presence of
'this guard our house was com
paratively free from a great many
intruders until about night Mr.
Boyleston, a neighbor who way
living on the site of the present
Methodist Church, sent a bottle
of brandy over with the request
that my mother try to save it
for him. She was hunting her
keys, as was often her custom;
my father having set the bottle
of brandy on the mantlepiece was
helping to look for the keys at
this moment I saw a Yankee
who had passed the guard walk
right up to the mantlepice and
takethe bottle by the neck. He
marched out and in five minutes
the place was literally swarm
ing with Yankees. They said
there was whiskey in the house
and they were going to have it.
My mtherexplained the cause
fo h r.esence of the bottle
but they did not believe her and
it greatly incensed her that they
would doubt her statement. She
told them they were a low down
set to doubt a lady's word and
Ithat she would prove them so to
be, and with the lamp in one
handand the keys in the other
she marched them from garret
to cellar. When they failed to
to find the whiskey she asked
them the question, "Is.there any
whiskey in the house?", They
s~aid, "No, madam, there is no
whiskey in this house." She
1said, "You intimated to me that
I was not tellinz the truth and I
have proven you to be illbred
degenerates. You contemptible
cowards, get out of my h'ouse."
My father told her to desist or
they might burn the house. She
Isaid, "Let' them burn; IJ am not
ariofthe whole set of them."
One fellow remarked, "If Bob
Lee had them all as game as you
ar, he would been in Washing
ton a long tiune ago." She said,
"If it were not for these child

Maggie Wilson Arrested I

Maggie Wilson, the begga
nuisance, is very well know
by most folks in Winnsboro, b;
virtue of numerous calls that sh
makes at each door "having Jus
come from Ridgeway, and trying
to beg enought money to' get t(
Rock Hill, where she has a% sicl
daughter." She was here abobi
two weeks ago, and e-identl.
got enough money to get to Rock
Hill, judging from the following
clipping from the Herald of Feb.
18th:
Wearing a shabby looking long
black coat, shabby dress, a hai
fashioned in the ninetie- and
with a wrinkled and care-worn
appearance, over which a pall of

Wilson, general beggar-nuisance

swore she would never again set
her foot in Rock Hill. There is
reason.
