WAR'S EFFECT ON AN
AMERICAN INDUSTRY
WHAT PAPER MAKERS ARE
CONTENDING AGAIN bl
Enormous Advance in Prices of
Bleach, Chemicals and Dyes-
Colored Paper Manufacturers
Forced to Suspend Production,
Boston For. a newspaper to be
classed among the "yellows now
is no reflection upon the quality
its news columns. No doubt
manv neoDle have been wonder
ing just what is the reason for
the jaundice hue of many pages
of the dailies and m some nazy
way connect it with Germany and
the war, which is quite right.
Rloiifih is scarce, and has ad
vanced enormously in price. Be
fore the war it was $28.50 a ton,
but now manufacturers of paper
are navine $330 a ton. Bleach,
which is nothing else than chlo
rine, formerly came to United
States almost entirely from Eng
land and Germany. But we have
been growing gradually more
self-sufficient. Most of the sup
plies now used in the United
States are made at Niagara Falls,
. , in Michigan and in Pennsylvania
'Many new plants have recently
started production, but the dc
mand is enormous. Wot only is
chlorine used as a bleach for pa-
per and cloth, but it is now m
great war demand for the manu-
. facture of high explosives. 1 he
plants of the Du Pont Co. are us
ing vast quantities of it.
Greater activity at the textile
mills has increased the demand
for bleach and the paper mills,
which a year or so ago were run-
ning hot over two-thirds full, are
now operating at capacity. Im
ports of paper from England,
Norway, Sweden and elsewhere
have been very much reduced.
Everything entering into the
manufacture' of paper, including
- the pulp itself, has advanced
greatly in price. All chemicals
have, gone up about 50 per cent.
... since the war broke out. Caustic,
which was chiefly imported, is a
bout 100 per cent, higher, and
. dyestuffs have risen 400 per cent.
,to 500 per cent. The pinch is be-
'fng felt especially in aniline blues,
such as rhodamine and indan
threne, which are used to give pa
per the white shade. So far as
the manufacture of colored paper
in the United States is concerned,
half the concerns making it have
been forced to suspend produc
tion. Colored paper today is very
hard to obtain.
Unbleached wood pulp has ad
vanced from $40 a ton to $58 or
an increase of 37.5 per cent.
Bleached pulp has risen from $55
a ton to 100, or close to 82 per
cent. A large part of the pulp
supply used to come from Ger
many, and this source is of course
cut off. Sweden and Norway, al
so important sources of supply,
have put embargoes on exporta
tion, but they are now issuing li
censes to permit pulp to come into
the United States. Normally -the
United States imported about
300,000 tons of wood pulp a year.
England has gone so far as to put
an embargo on all kinds of paper
making materials.
With all these factors combined
it is not surprising to find that
book papers have advanced $10 to
$15 a ton since the outbreak of
the war. Although there has been
''a substantial, advance in news
print, its effect is not yet marked,
lue to the fact that it is sold "far
ahead on contract.
Poultry Production May be Stud
ied by Mail
If there is any business more
hazardous than a grocery or res
taurant for the average man it is
poultry. A great many persons
so in for poultry every spring.
Something in spring makes them
turn to poultry. Their informa
tion about the business consists
principally of enthusiasm. Now
enthusiasm is essential to any bus
iness, but it needs a governor.
Most of these spring poultry
raisers lose their enthusiasm be
fore they get very far.
Poultry is a good business.
There is money in it but fowls

will not raise themselves. Too
many persons start out with
scant information. For this rea
son the University of Florida Col
lege of Agriculture is offering a
correspondence course m poultry
production. It is hoped that this
course will save those who want
to raise poultry from some of the
common pitfalls.
Answering the query of the St.
Petersburg Times, "Who in Flori
da really wants a free press, any
how?", the Lakeland Telegram
says: rretty nearly everynouy,
we believe, except those whose
conduct fails to square with good
morals and good citizenship. The
wrongdoers who fear the publici
ty of the press; those who look
askance at enlightenment and ed
ucation and progress, and a cer
tain class of politicians and office
seekers who prefer to have a free
hand in'' appealing to ignorance
and prejudice as the easiest way
to court favor and get votes
these are the people who don't
want a free press. All the others
do. ,
An English jury charges the
Kaiser and the Crown Prince
with murder, but the police have
made no arrests so far.

A New Orange
The Winter Park Hybrid is the
name of a new orange that has
been "discovered" in Winter
Park and the Winter Park Post
says that it is going to be a big
winner in the markets of the
country in the years to come. The
orange is described as having" the
general shape and kid glove qual
ity of the tansrerine. the color and
odor of the pineapple orange,
while the pulp has the combined
flavor of the king and the full
ripe Valencia." The Post says
that when the oransre is noeled the
skin gives off the pungent, aro
matic odor of the sour orange.but
the juice is sweet and melting.
The tree is the property .of M. E.
Gillett, who has tried to find out
just where to locate the new or
ange but on consultation with
experts and thoroush examina
tion, is unable to place the fruit
any Previously known class.
The tree will be carefully remov
ed to a greenhouse and extensive
budding will be done by the own
er who expects to be able to furn
ish the budded trees, ready for
planting in about three years.

Fort Myers, Secretary W. S. Gil

sociation, on his recent trip
through southwest Florida, Svas
cordially and warmly received;
but at no place was he more fa
vorably impressed with the gener
al conditions existing, the meth
ods of road building and the
highway projects that are being
carried out than at Punta Gorda
and in this special road and
bridge district. -
This was gained from expres
sions in Mr. Gilbreath 's speech in
the Dixie Theatre, at a well at
tended meeting Friday night, and
from what he said privately to
individuals before and since the
meeting; and it is confidently be
lieved that he will use his influ
ence to have the Dixie Highway
extended south through this city
and Fort Myers, down the coast
and through. the lower everglades
to Miami, making this the main
thoroughfare instead of an auxil
iary as at present. - ,
Mr. Gilbreath reached Punta
Gorda from Arcadia, Friday af
ternoon, coming down with Secre
tary Tucker of the bond trustees
of this special district, in the lat
ter's automobile, accompanied by
Ed Scott, a well known good
roads booster. He was met at
Shell creek by a large number of
representative citizens of this
city, in automobiles, there having
been seventeen cars to come into
the city with him. This mark of
courtesy, as well as the supper in
the Seminole Hotel at which he
was entertained, impressed the
visitor with the public-spirit and
enthusiasm, of Punta Gordans
when it comes to something that
is calculated to be of benefit to
this section. ,
He was further impressed by
the large attendance at the meet
ing held later in the evening. A.
B. Tucker, who has always taken
a leading part in the good roads
movement here, presided at this
meeting; and besides him and a
number of other leading citizens
of Punta Gorda, Hon. Ed Scott
of Arcadia, Dixie Highway Com
missioner for Florida, and C. A.
Rocamore, Mr. Gilbreath 's travel
ing companion, . occupied posi
tions on the stage. The speech
making, however, was confined to
Mr. Gilbreath, who was introduc
ed by Mr. Tucker, and talked for
about forty-five minutes.

the great highway project and
how it is being carried ouj, exhib
ited a map showing the tributary
territory from which an enormous
travel will come south over this
thoroughfare, told of the wealth
of the population of that territory
and the number of automobiles
represented, estimating what it
will mean to this section when
that travel is turned this way. He
expressed his pleasure at seeing
ladies in the audience and touch
ed upon the important part that
they can play in this and other
undertakings. Speaking of how
finances of the association have
been provided and what is yet to
be done to encourage improve
ment of roads in certain localities.
he invited others to join the local
association, explaining that the
THRIPS REDUCE
Sec the little yellow insects in
the orange bloom 1 They are
thrips. Thrips feed on the sta
mens and petals of citrus flowers.
If there are plenty of blooms and
few thrips, noparticular harm
will be done, because many of the
blooms will drop anyawy; but, if
there are many thrips and few
blooms, the yield will be diseased.

Station, reminds growers of a

membership fees would go to
wards the accomplishment of the
great work undertaken. Con
cluding, he expressed himself as
greatly pleased that Punta Gor
dans were interested to the ex
tent of having already presented
him with the names of a sufficient
number of members to permit of
having a council of the associa
tion here.

Mr. Tucker and Mr. Bowdoin of
Charlotte Harbor, went from here
to Fort Myers, Saturday morning.
making the trip over the recently
opened road that is a part of the
Dixie Highway auxiliary; and on
this trip, as well as when coming
down from Arcadia, he was ena
bled to closely observe the road
work that is now under way in
the Punta Gorda special road ane
Dridge district, and he spoke in
the highest terms of the method
of construction and the plan upon
which it is being carried out say
ing that wisdom and experience
was shown by the builders. He
stressed the value of the drainage
systems that have been provided
which will protect the roads and
benefit adjacent lands.
At Fort Myers, Mr. Gilbreath
stated that Punta Gorda was the
first place in Florida where he
found a council organized and the
money paid in before he arrived
ui the. town. Punta Gorda has
over twenty members now. A list
of eighty-seven names for mem
bership was presented by Fort
Myers.
In his public address and in re
marks m general conversation,
Secretary Gilbreath while at Fort
Alyers, spoke in part to this ef-
lect:
"I was lead to believe that I
would find nothing but a sand
pile with a few log huts at Punta

uorua anu rori Myers, out in
stead I find the most beautiful
part of this beautiful state, with
splendid people, lovely dwellings
and prosperous rural settlements
that testify progress and prosper
ity
though I can't pledge the
Dixie Highway, I am reporting
ravoraoie; and my report states
the work being done, present con
dition, whether bonds have been
issued and other prospects of
building, and I see no reason why
the route should not become the
Dixie Highway.
"Had-it not been for one of the
Punta Gorda boosters coming to
Arcadia and almost compelling
me to come, i would not have seen
your tdwn or Punta Gorda. for I
knew nothing of your bond issues
or your road building, and I had
determined not to come to vou. I
have never been more pleasantly
surprised and better paid for a
trip."
Mr. Gilbreath returned to Ar
cadia from Fort Myers the first of
this week, whence he went to the
bast Coast, and he is now insDect-
ing the route of the Dixie High
way north from Miami. He inti
mated that he would come again
to Punta Gorda, within a few
weeks, and make a trip over the
route of the Tamiami Trail
through the proposed Charlotte
Harbor special district and Mana
tee county to Tampa.

If the thrips are not numerous,
they do not attack the important
parts of the flower, the ovary and
receptacle. But if other food be
comes scarce, they will attack
these parts and cause the bloom
to drop, but the young remain
and feed on the ovary and recep
tacle until they yellow and drop.
If they arc not numerous enough
to make the fruit drop, they will
continue to feed on the young
fruit and thus mark it. These
marks, which are called , thrip

fruit begins to color. These, like

ious damage done by thrips when
they are numerous.. In years of
scanty bloom or when the insects
are numerous, it is important to
protect the trees. Mr. Watson
recommends the following spray:
Five quarts of commercial lime
sulfur, 32 degrees Baume, in 100
gallons of water. Add to this
one half pint of black leaf 40, or
other tobacco extract. Spray di
rectly into the bloom.
Bulletin 108 of the Florida Sta
tion makes the following state
ment: "The first spraying should
be done after most of the petals
have shed. This may be follow
ed by a second spraying ten to
fourteen days later, and by a
thiwl in three or four weeks.
Spraying Bhould be thorough,
since only the thrips hit are kill
ed. This spraying will also kill
any rust mites that may be pres
ent." A second or third spray
ing may not be necessary, espec
ially if sprayings for other in
sects with lime sulfur are made
later.

Plant Disease-Resistant Cowpeas
Florida soil needs organic mat
ter more than anything else. The
hot sun, loose sand, leaching
rains and depicting crops contri
bute to the rapid disappearance
of organic matter. For this rea
son farmers must continually re
furnish the soil with organic ma
terial.
Legumes and green manuring
plants are natural fertilizing
crops. The value or cowpeas as
a soil builder and forage crop is
known. E. S. Pace, district agent
for the University of Florida Ex
tension Division, recommends
that farmers plant disease-resistant
varieties. The Brabham and
ron arc more resistant than the
other varieties. They are recom
mended for land infested with
root-knot. It may not be possi
ble to obtain all the seed neces
sary to plant the whole crop, but
small plot for seed should be
planted to Brabham or Iron or a
small ,plot to each.
Any Florida newspaper that
publishes an attack upon a candi
date, no matter by whom made,
whether made by the newspaper
itself, by a correspondent or by
or in another newspaper, is
required by law to give the candi
date free of charge the same
space in which to answer the at
tack. The Herald will observe
the law.
NEITHER SIDE GAINS
DECISIVE ADYANTA6E
The Tide of Battle Fluctuates
Russians Continue Energetic
Campaign Against Turks
Casualties of the British.
London, England The battle
of Verdun is raging with great
intensity. It is far from decisive
despite the fact that it is now in
the second week of the struggle.
The Germans have taken ground
and captured one of the ring of
forts surrounding the city, but
the main defenses are practically
untouched.
The tide of battle fluctuates. It
would be unfair to say that either
side has gained a decided advan
tage. True, the Germans have
taken Fort Douaumont, but the
fort was practically demolished
by German shells before it was e
vacuated, and since the Germans
entered it French artillery have
completed the work of destruc
tion. Both sides have brought up big
reserves. The raris reports now
place the German forces attack
ing the Verdun line at three-quarters
of a million, whereas they
had perhaps less than half a mil
lion when the attack was begun.
And the losses on both sides have
been tremendous, but the French
insist the Germans, as the attack
ing party, have lost most heavily,
and this appears to be probable.
Paris is confident that the Ger
mans will soon expend their at
tacking strength and must fall
back. There is no fear expressed
there that the Teutons will break
through the French lines and be
gin a fresh advance on Paris,
which seems to be the German
objective; .
The Russians are energetically
continuing their campaign a
gainst the Turks in Armenia. Ad
vices from Petrograd declare that
the Turkish forces are hastily e-
vacuating Trebizond on the Black
sea and other nearby towns on the
coast m the Caucasus region. Re
cent dispatches have reported the
Russians closing in on Trebizond
both from the east along the
coast and from the direction of
Erzcrum, the captured Turkish
stronghold.
Sinking of the former French
liner La Provence, a converted
cruiser, in the Mediterranean last
Saturday, was officially announc
ed in Paris Tuesday. The vessel
m peace times was engaged in
trans-Atlantic trade between New-
York and Havre.
Casualties of the 'British forces
in the various fighting areas pub
lished during February totalled
739 officers and 17,847 men. This
was somewhat smaller than dur
ing January, when the published
losses amounted to 1,079 officers
and 19,624 men.
Do You Want Information
on
Diseases?
The University of Florida Ex
periment Station is anxious to re
ceive specimens of plants affect
ed by any diseases that are troub-
mg growers. The service of the
institution can be greatly increas
ed, if farmers will co-operate in
inquiring about diseases which at
tack crops. It is impossible for
investigators to canvass the state,
but their work can be facilitated
by the co-operation of farmers. '
Dr. C. D. Sherbakoff, associate
plant pathologist to the Station,
suggest that specimens be pack
ed so as to reach the station in
good condition. He also asks
that the farmer give his experi
ence with the disease, just how it
affects the plants, how rapidly it
develops and any other informa
tion that may be available. As
many stages of the disease as can
be found should be sent. Select
plants or parts of plants which
are just beginning to show the
disease and others which have
been killed or which show the ex
treme damage. Be sure to send
all parts of the plant attacked. A
single leaf, branch or stem may
not be enough to identify the
trouble.
