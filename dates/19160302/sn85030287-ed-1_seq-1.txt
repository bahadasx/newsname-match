About Those Chickens
With the approach of spring
and the planting of gardens and
flowers, many persons are ask
ing this question: "Is the chick
en ordinance going to be enforc
ed?" ,
For tbe benefit of those who
may desire the wording of this
particular ordinance, we reprint
same:
"Section 1 That it shall be
unlawful for and person or per
sons to keep or have under his or
her control any chicken, duck,
turkey, goose, guinea or any
other domestic lowl within tbe
limits of tbe City of Meade unless
tbe same be kept safely and se
curely confined in a' coop, pen
or enclosure upon the premises
of said person or persons.
Section 2 , Tbat it shall be un
lawful for domestic fowelstorun
at large within the city limits of
the city of Meade between the
first days of March and October,
and all such fowls running at
large sball be deemed a com
mon nuisance and any ptrson or
persons allowing his, her, or their
fowls to run at large within tbe
city limits between said dates
shall upon conviction thereof be
fined as1 hereinafter proyided.
Section 3 That it shall be un
lawful for the owner, keeper, or
possessor of any chicken, duck,
turkey, goose, pigeon or other
domestic bird or owl, to permit
or suffer the. same to tres
pass upon the premises of an
other within the city limitsof the
city of Meade under a penalty
hereinafter provided.
Section 4 Any person who
shall violate any of the provisions
of this ordinance shall upon con
viction thereof, be fined not less
than one nor more than ten dol
lars and upon default in tbe pay
ment of such fine and costs, to
be committed to jail until sucb
fine and costs sball be paid."
There seems to be no question
as to tbe provisions of tbe ordi
nance. No owner of chickens
or other domestic, fowl is per
mitted to allow tame to trespass
on tbe premises of bis neighbor.
We trust that those wbo care
to keep chickens may so regard
tbe ordinance that they and their
neighbors wbo have lawns and
gardens may live it peace and
harmony.
