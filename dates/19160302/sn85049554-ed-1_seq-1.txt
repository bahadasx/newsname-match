Washington, March 2. The
armed ship issue suddenly blazed
up in the senate today in the most
^sensational debate of the session,
fls which 8enator Gore, author of a
resolution to warn Americans off
balligsrent vessels, repeated what
ha characterized as a report that
^President Wilson had told certain
'Oengress leaders that war between
the United States and Germany
might not be "ungrateful" and
might "advance the cause of civil-
.. ization by bringing about the end
,pf the war by midsummer."
"-c. Chairman Stone, of the foreign
"^.relations committee, emphatically
denied ha.had ever heard the presi
dent make such a statement, and
Senator James demanded why
Senator Gore had not sought to
confirm the report from the presi
dent himself.
8enator Gore responded he had
hoped the report was untrue that
he fiad repeated it only as a re
port' surrounded by circumstances
which gave it credence, in hie
opinion* but that ho was glad to
hue it denied."
.The storm broke in the senate
smexpeetedly, when Senator Stone,
aanmuteing that he was not in sc
oot*} with the president's demand
witit-'tho prospect of taking up the
Gore resolution early tomorrow.
Meanwhile the situation in the
lioupo was unohangod, with the
administration leaders apparently
making no headway for a vote
