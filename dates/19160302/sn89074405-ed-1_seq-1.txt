armed ship issue at 5 o'clock this
afternoon at the president's request.
The president Intends to place the
Issue squarely before the republi
cans in an effort to gain their sup
port.
Washington, March 2.—President
Wilson told Chairman Flood of the
house foreign affairs committee that
he would consent to no compromise
on the armed ship issue, and desired
a direct vote on the resolution warn
ing Americans off armed ships of the
belligerent nations. Chairman Flood
took the president's decision to the
committee.
Reports to the administration were
that yesterday ten members of the
foreign affairs committee were in
favor of reporting out the McLemore
resolution to warn Americans oil
armed ships, and nine members were
against it.
Meeting Delayed.
The meeting of jfh* committee,
which was to have been veld this
morning was postponed until S o'clock
tUifc'frfCernoon. when Chairman Flood
will dellvejr the president's message.
Meagwljfte the- president kept tii

sary. President Wilson had not been
esked to see any committees of either
house, to send any facts to congress,
or to appeal before congress in person
as has been informally suggested.
"Soft Soap" Resolution.
Administration officials character
ised the proposed vote of confidence
as "a soft soap" resolution to endorse
the president, and at the same time
warn Americans off armed ships. They
reiterated that no such resolution
would be satisfactory. There are
some indications, according to these
officials, that the president's stand is
having the desired effect on the house.
They felt that the only obstacle now
is in the foreign affairs committee.
Wants Immediate Action.
In his talk with Chairman Flood
the president said flatly and emphati
cally that what he wanted was a vote
on the McLemore resolution or a sim
ilar one. He made it plain that he

UNBIASED ACTION
DEMANDED STONE
EXPLAINS AFFAIRS
Washington, March a.—From the
floor of the senate today. Senator
Stone declared that he and the
president "were not in accord" on
the armed merchantmen agitation.
"I desire to state the Interna
tional situation as I understand It,"
said Senator Stone
"A sharp issue has been defined
between Germany and Great Bri
tain as to the status of armed mer
chantmen. Germany contends that
armed merchant, vessels are. the
equivalent of auxiliary war vessels
and has announced her policy to be
that, after March 1, armed mer
chantmen would be regarded aa
warships and subject to the rales
of war. On the other hand Great
Britain contends that under Inter
national law, merchantmen have
the right to be armed for defensive
purposes and that armed merchant
men arc entitled, under the law, to
the same immunity aa unarmed
ships, without regard to cargo. She
has announced her intentions to
carry out that policy.
"That Is the issue between these
two governments.
"Now where does the United
States come In? In this way: If
both persist In these courses, neith
er yielding to each other nor to the
Importunities of. neutral nations,
and if Germany attacks an armed
merchantman and any American
citizen is Injured, the question Is
presented to this government. What
will our attitude be?
"To my mind, this emergency Is
of high Importance. The president,
senators and representatives should
speak with each other and with the
country, free from political bias.
We should wear oar hearts on onr
sleeves so we may know onr posi
tions exactly."
CONTWUETO
CARRY ARMS,
Ambassador Notifies Amer
ican Government that no
Change will be Made.
Rome, Italy, March 2.—The Ital
ian ambassador at Washington,
Count Macchl, has been instructed
to notify the American govern
ment that notwithstanding the Ger
man and Austrian decrees regard
ing the sinking of armed merchant
men, the Italian merchantmen will
continue to carry armament.
RESTRICT SALES.
Washington, March 2.—Australia,
at the request of the British govern
ment, has put a prohibition on the
sale of typewriters manufactured by
the Remington Typewriter company
on the ground that the corporation is
suspected of selling to enemies of the
allies. It became known yesterday
that the Remington company has laid
its case before the state department,
denying the charge and alleging it is
the victim of the jealousy of English
manufacturers.
The American concern heretofore
has sold In Australia about 75 per
cent of all the typewriters used. Eng
lish Arms, the company asserts, have
taken advantage of the situation
created by the war to drive their suc
cessful competitor out of a rich field
by false accusations under the broad
terms of the "trading with the enemy
act."
The embargo permits the sale of
Remington machines now in Australia
and all in transit at the time the order
was issued. This supply, it Is said,
will keep the company's Australian
business going for another six months.
NEW UNION ORGANIZATION.
Washington, March 2.—A newly or
ganised union, claiming to represent
1,000 conductors and motormen em
ployed by the capital's two street rail
way companies yesterday presented
to the companies demands for higher
wages, shorter hours, and better
working conditions.
A wage rate of thirty cents an hour
was asked. The maximum now is
twenty-five.

SUCCESS THERE
Gore Resolution Expected to
be Reported Out—Clear
Parliamentary.
DENIES WAR REPORT.
Washington, March 2.—Senator
Gore declared in the senate that
the Impelling reason for his
course was the report that the
president had told certain con
gressmen that war between the
United States and Germany,
"might hot be ungrateful and
might result in advancing civili
sation by bringing about the end
of the European war by midsum
mer."'
Senator Stone vehemently de
nied It. Senator Lodge urged
that the Issue not be met as a
party question.
Washington, March 2.—The ad
ministration forces evidently are lin
ing up for a vote in the senate on the
armed ship resolutions. Senator Stone
at the opening of the session, propos
ed an adjournment to take the sen'
ate out of recess, in which it has been
working, so as to clear the parlia
mentary situation for a vote on Sen
ator Gore's resolution. Stone made
the suggestion after a conference with
administration leaders, who decided
that the situation, in jthe house Js so
complex with the possibility of a de
lay that they would not wait for a
vote, but. would go ahead in the sen
ate, where they are confident the an
ti-administration resolutions can be
defeated.
Gore Resolution.
It seemed to be the plan to bring
the Gore resolution up tomorrow.
Senator James, one of the administra
tion supporters, said:
"It has been decided to bring the
resolution up for action as soon as
possible, but probably not today. We
have got the votes in the senate to
smash it."
Senator Stone from the floor an
nounced that he and the president
were not in accord on the issue.
BIG SHIPS TO
HAUL FREIGHT
New York, March 2.—The big pas
senger steamships Lapland, Baltic
and Adriatic of the White Star line,
will be used exclusively as freight
carriers until April 12, at the earliest,
the International mercantile marine
company announced late yesterday.
The steerage accomodations on the
vessels will be removed, thus adding
cargo space for approximately 2,000
tons more In each. The Lapland was
scheduled to SRil from Nwe York on
March 8, the Baltic on March 15, and
the Adriatic on March 29.
It was estimated that 58,000 tons
dead weight can be carried on the
ships on these three voyages. As there
will be no passengers on board, loaded
ammunition for use by the British
forces can be carried In addition to
the usual war supplies it was said.

Berlin, March 2.—(By Wireless to
Sayville).—"German newspapers yes
terday comment with satisfaction on
the acquittal of the Swiss colonels,
Egll and de Wlttenwyl," says the Ov
erseas News agency, "not only because
the German military attaches in Swit
zerland have been freed from suspic
ion of having behaved incorrectly, but
because the two highly esteemed offi
cers, who tried to serve their native
country in every manner, proved their
innocence of the unjust charges made
by enemies of the central powers."
"Newspapers," continues the Over
seas News agency, "also call atten
tion to the statement made by Colonel
de Sprecher de Bernegg, chief of the
Swiss general staff who Is quoted as
saying:
'We not only have duties, bat
rights of neutrality, for Instance, the
right of unhindered postal traffic and
further, of commerce with neutrals,
and these rights are curtailed in the

Chicago, March 2.—What was tak
en as an indication of the probable
defense of William Lorimer, former
United States senator on the charge of
conspiracy in connection with the fail
ure of the La Salle Trust and Savings
bank, was revealed here yesterday in
the examination veniremen.
"Do you think there are bank pres
idents who are presidents In name
only, knowing nothing of the affairs
of the bank?" asked Albert Fink,
counsel for Mr. Lorimer, of a venire
man. The latter answered in the af
firmative.
"And that these presidents get no
salary for the use of their names?"
Mr. Fink queried.
"Would you think that a bank pres­|were
ident who received no salary has
much to do with the affairs of the
bank?" he continued.
The venireman answered "yes" to
both.
When court adjourned last night
the status of the jury was the same
as at the opening of court yesterday
morning—twelve men having been
tentatively accepted by both sides.

Chihuahua state, resulted in disorders

POSTPONE CEREMONIES.
Peking, March 4.—(Correspondence
of The Associated Press)—By special
command of President Yuan Shi-kal
plans for holding the enthronement,
ceremonies in February were cancel-'
led and no date is yet set for the
president's accession. The reason as
signed for the postponement is the
disturbance in the province of Yun
nan, but the earnestness with which
the Entente Powers advised delay is
believed to have been a factor in the
decision.
While the postponement saves Yuan
Shl-kai from immediate international
complications. It does not improve his
domestic problems. In fact it will
doubtless be capitalised heavily by th®
revolutionists as an indication of his
weakness in that he yielded to pres
sure from Japan and the other for
eign powers.
One of the chief chaises the revo
lutionists have brought against the
president Is that he has not imparted
dignified standing .to China In the eyes
of the world powers, and they have
blamed him with truckling to Japan
on various occasions.

New Outline for Re-organi

Rejected.
Jefferson City, Mo., March 2.—The
modified plan for the reorganization
of the St. Louis and San Francisco
railroad submitted on February 18 by
Festius J. Wade of St. Louis, was re
jected in most of its features by the
Missouri public service commission
yesterday.
Its rejection as to most of its fea
tures yesterday leaves 'Frisco reor
ganisation a problem of the future.
One feature in which the Wade
plan differed from the original plan
was the provision that four, instead
of two of the seven voting trustees
who were to hold the stock and con
trol the road for five years should
represent the stockholders. In the
original plan the majority of the
trustees represented the bondholders,
but this feature was so strenuously
opposed before the commission that
the modified plan was submitted by
Mr. Wade who was named as one of
the trustees in the original plan, and
his own.
The commission yesterday rejected
the voting trust feature as contrary
to the Missouri constitution. On the
same ground it rejected the voting
trust proposed in the original reor
ganization plan. That part of the
plan providing for six per cent inter
est on income mortgage bonds, also
was rejected. The only section of the
Wade modification accepted by the
commission was that which provide
for the exchange of general lien
bonds.

Fails, March 2.—IV war of
fice announcement «ys that there
was an intermittent bombard
ment of the Verdun and Woent
fronts during the night, but that
there were no developments of
importance.
The press and pnhtto of France
are mystelfled at the continued
pause In the German attacks
around Verdun. Caution, born at
experience, leads generally to the
rejection of the view that the
Germans have given np all hope
of trying to capture the Lorraine
fortresses.
EXPECT GREATER ATTACKS.
It is thought more likely that
they merely are resting before
starting afresh with u.n slat en
ergy. it la believed In many quar
ters that the attack on Verdun Is
only a preliminary to operations
on a much larger scale for the
purpose of trying to crush the
French once and for all.

However, that may be, It is
affirmed that General Joffree Is
fully prepared for all eventuali

Hie question Is raised aa to
whether the new German attack
will again be qpon Verdun or
along the front from Somaw to
the Aisne river, the southern
limit, which is many miles nearer
Parts than Verdun. Should the
Germans attempt the latter plan
they will be liable to a flank at
tack by British in Artoia and
Flanders.
FRENCH UNSUCCESSFUL.
Berlin, March 2.—An official Ger
man statement says the French
sacrificed men unsuccessfully in a
counter attack on Fort Douaumoot,
one of the outlying defenses of Ver

Germans. The situation on the

London, March S.—Sir Edward
Grey, secretary for forslgn affairs, au
thorizes for publication ths following

"The assumption apparently made
by the German government that all
British merchant ships are armed is
entirely incorrect. Practioally all Brit
ish merchant ships employed in trade
between the United States of America
and the United Kingdom have hither

"The claim, therefore, made by ths
German government to sink all Brlt
lah merchant ships at sight because
of their armament Is one which can
not possibly be justified. This is dear
ly proved by the statement issued last
night, giving a list of British and neu
tral unarmed merchant ahips which
have been torpedoed by German sub
marines without warning.

of War Tax Bills
Berlin, March 2.—(By Wireless to

"It is estimated that the new taxes
will yield 500,000,000 marks. They
will consist of taxes on special war
benefits and on receipts. There will
be additional postage dues, a tax on
waybills and a tax on tobacco will be

"The government on drafting the
bills took several points of view Into

necessity for a tax on special bene
fits made during ths war It is neces
