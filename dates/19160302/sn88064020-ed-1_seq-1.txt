been investigated and the manufac

or four months before the steel would
be shipped. Mr. Hopkins stated he
had taken the matter up again and
urged shipment earlier, and hoped to
have this done so that the work of
constructing the bridge could begin at
once.
Material for the shops, and other im
provements is arriving by the carload
and there will be no further delay in
completing the work beyond that over
which the company has no control.
Steel and concrete will form the make
up of the new structures and they are
to be modern in every detail, the shops
themselves to be among the finest and
best equipped in the South.
