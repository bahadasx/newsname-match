WOULD UNITE CIVIC
WELFARESOCIETIES
Prof. D. H. Doane Proposes
Idea to the Commercial
Club.
HAS DETAILED PLAN
Central Organization Would
Prevent Overlapping
of Duties.
A plan for a milted citizenship of
CoWmlda and the surrounding com
munity was buggered to the Com
mercial Club at its luncheon today
y Prof. I). II. Doane of the College
of Agriculture.
The plan calls for the formation
of a Columbia Community league
composed of seventeen or more ex
isting civic organizations. The ob
ject of such an organization is to plan
the activities of the communty and
prevent an overlapping of duties.
The idea is not a new one. but has
been considered by W. B. Nowell, Jr.,
president of the Retail Merchants'
Association, and C. O. Hanes, secre
tary of the Commercial Club, for
more than a year. Professor Doane
had a program mapped out in more
detail than Mr. Hanes or Mr. Nowell.
Tho matter was referred to the exe
cutive committer of the Commercial
Club.
According to the chart prepared by
Professor Doane, an executive coun
cil from each of the important or
ganizations working for community
betterment would plan all activities
of a public nature, would work out
a budget system of collecting funds
and would curb undertakings which
were not considered for the welfare of
tho town.
The organizations mentioned on the
chart as proper ones to combine in
such a league are: The Boone Coun
ty Fair Association, Columbia Com
mercial Club, Retail Merchants' As
sociation, Boy Scouts, Automobile
Association, Civic league. Farmers'
Salo Association, Junior Business,
League, Boone County Poultry xsfo
ciadon. Charity Organization Socie
ty. "There are as many as seventeen
organizations eligible to membership
In tho league." said Mr. Doane. "Let
each keep its identity except in cases
where the duties of one overlap those
of another.
"Every man has his hobby. The
work of a community league would be
enough to cover the hobby of every
one." Mr. Doane suggested thai' a mass
meeting or banquet be held to form
the organization.
"Sedalia paid more than $1,000 to
get a united organization for the
town's activities similar to and no
beer than Rhe ono propose 1 'iere.
Columbia can complete the organiza
tion without spending a dollar."

al Arch Masons will hold a chapter of

Two Suits on Notes Filed.
Two suits on notes were filed today
against John S. Chandler of Colum
bia, a stockman. The B-on County
Mill ami Kli';itor C.mitny sues on a
note of tlii.90. trade Deennber 17,
1915, which It claims has matured
with no part of it havin,, been paid.
The McAlester Lumber Company
brings suit for ithe amount of a note
made November 23, 1915. of $227.50
and 10 per cent of the face value of
the iicte as an attorney's fee.
Miss Ola May Wilhlfe to Wed.
A marriage license was Issued today
to Robert K. Singleton of Murry, 22
years old. and Miss Ola May Wilhlte,
20, near Hallsville. The couple will
be married tonight at the home of the
bride's parents.
DAUGHTER TO WED, SnE HEARS
Rut Mrs. Rupard Had Never Had a
Hint of the Man In the Case.
An awakened interest in household
linen generally means one thing to tho
mother of a girl that the girl is get
ting ready to carry the keys to a lin
en closet of her own. Therefore, when
a Missourlan reporter went to the
home of Miss Opal Rupard, the daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. J. IL Rupard, now
living on Madison avenue in Columbia,
and told her mother that a marriage
license had been issued to her daugh
ter, who is teaching school at C'lays
ville, and Ray 111 the of Hartsburg,
Mrs. Rupard said she was not sur
prised. "I suspected something when she
was home between semesters and dis
played such a keen interest in house
hold linen," said Mrs. Rupard. "No,
1 never heard or the young man. She
neer wen hinted that there was one.
but she did tell mc not to count on
her coming home when school was out
(April 1), as she was going on a visit
to Oklahoma."
Mrs. Rupard thought that she prob
ably would na: be married until
school closes, but Mr. Rupard said:
"People don't take out marriage li
censes a month in advance."
The license was issued yesterday by
Recorder John L. Henry, application
having come in the day before from a
notary at Hartsburg, with the request
that the license be "kept out of the
papers."
Mr. and Mrs. Rupard deduced that
the young man must be a schoolteach
er, since Miss Rupard went to Harts
burg twice a month on school busi
ness. Miss Rupard was graduated from
the Columbia High School four years
ago. Last winter she re-entered to do
some graduate work. She has been
teaching school at Claysville since last
September.
STONE FORCES ISSUE
Stops Other Discussion to
Oppose President in Armed
Ship Warning.
Iiy United Press
WASHINGTON, March 2. President
Wilson's conflict with Congress broke
out in the Senate this afternoon when
Senator William J. Stone of Missouri
interrupted a discussion of the Shield's
water power bill to make a statement
in regard to the Gore Bill, warning
Americans to stay off armed ships.
Senator Lodge followed tho Mlssou
rian with a demand for a vote at once.
Stone admitted that he and the Pres
ident differed on the question. He said
that Mr. Wilson is disposed to support
the contention that ships have the
right to arm for defensive purposes.
Senator Stone holds that armed ships
transporting reserves, munitions and
other contraband are strictly warships.
POSTOFFICE ADDS SUIS-CAHRIF.R
Extra Man Will Re Used During
HeaTy School Months.
One man has been added to the city
carrier force at tho postofllce.
"He is not to be a regular carrier
but will be designated as a sub-carrier,"
said James 11. Guitar, postmast
er. "The present forco is sufficient
to take care of the city mail, with a
few exceptions. The year-around
business does not warrant a steady
man. In tho summer the business at
the local office is a great deal less
than during the winter months. This
fact, prevents the department putting
t-n a regular man. The substitute
can be laid off during a slack in busi
ness. "The business transacted since
January 1 Is several thousand dollars
greater than for the corresponding
time last year."

Although the University Missourian(
is not an employer of printers ami'
therefore has no connection with the j
printers' strike, the local Typographi-.
cal Union has distributed printed
cards, of which the above is a sample,
among the merchants of Columbia.
Thus far eight signed cards have been
received by the Missourian, from the
following.
A. B. Long, a grocer.
Busy Bee Candy Kitchen.
Joe .lanousek, a picture dealer.
I A. Serkes, tailor.
Rex Billiard Parlor.
li. Gentsch, baker.
Exchange Cafe.
D. Settles, president Local C20, Jour
neyman Barbers' Union.
The Missouriau has no comment, at
this time, to make upon this action of
the union. It merely desires to call
attention to the following 'facts, the
first of which is obvious to anyone who
observes the "flag" of the paper printed
at the top of the editorial column:

MORTALITY CHARTS CLOUD
SUNSHINE FOR BABY SHOW
TONKJIirS PROGRAM
At The Child Welfare Exhibit, 12
North Tenth Street.
Beginning at 7 Talks by Professor
George Lefevre on heredity and by
Percy Werner. Jr., on "The Care of
Milk in tho Home."
Thp pliihil will hf niiMi until 9
o'clock. Both fathers and mothers
are united to hear the lectures.
All is not sunny at the baby exhibit
at 12 North Tenth street. If the moth
ers of Columbia are to appreciate the
value of the proper clothing and other
exhibits shown, those in charge of
Baby Week have decided that they
must be reminded of the reasons for
their use. So, side by side with the
most scientific arrangements for the
health of baby, the evils resulting
from ignorance are shown.
No, everything is not Ideal by any
means. There are charts and col
umns of figures whlcji have spelled
sickness and death for many Colum
bia babies in the past. In the charts.
death drinks to the general death in
stead of the general health of the ta
ble from a glass of impure milk; ty
phoid brings unclean milk from the in
sanitary dairy; the faker and death
are partners, dealing in "cures" for
consumption. "Sickness" runs a cut-
rate shop of adulterated food in com
petition with the pure food shop of
"Health"; the driver offers his horse
an individual drinking bucket, while
the child waits to use the public
drinking cup.
There is a chart which shows the
weaker chance of life for the bottle
fed baby. The greatest mortality Is
about the first of September. Colum
bia's infant mortality is compared
with that of other Missouri towns, to
Columbia's disadvantage. One baby
for every 379 persons in Columbia
died in 1915; 1 for every 4SC in Kan
sas City: 1 for every ."09 in St. Ix)uls;
1 for every r24 In Hannibal; 1 for
every 700 In Jefferson City.

by the Herald-Statesman Publishing
Company, as implied in the card here
with reproduced, but by the Unhersity
Missourian Association, an incorpo
rated body of students, the names of
whose board of directors are printed in
the "flag."
2. . The Missourian is printed by the
Herald-Statesman Publishing Company
at a contract pricq, being handled by
that company like any other "job" of
printing. The Missourian has noth
ing to do with the policy of the Her
ald-Statesman, and the Herald-States
man has nothing to do with the policy
of the Missourian. Nothing is said in
the printing contract as to the kind of
labor that shall be employed. The
only requirement is that the Herald
Statesman Publishing Company deliv
er a satisfactory product.
The Missourian, without presuming
now to pass upon the merits of the
issue between the employers and the
striking printers, wishes its readers to
know on what ground an effort is being
made to deprive it of business, and the
names of the persons with whom this
effort is successful.
That there is hope of a bo ter rec
ord for Columbia in the future, how
ever, is shown by many of the ex
hibits themselves. A screened, out
door sleeping bed is homemade, as
well as a pasteurizing outfit. There
is a picture book of babies, anima
and more babies.
One Columbia baby has more than a
small part in the exhibit. The ideal
nursery is hung with tho Mother
Gooso pictures from his nursery. The
baskot of cloth'es and toilet articles,
the use of which ho has outgrown, is
his also, and the ono weo creeping
shoo thrown carelessly on a table, as
if just taken off, shows that Columbia
is raising some of her babies the wel
fare way.
There is also promise of a better
future in the visitors. It is not only
tho mother who comes. Roth col
leges have bent students. The home
economies class from Christian Col
lege is coming a second time.
Fifteen negro women attended
Tuesday afternoon, the time set aside
for them. There were several school
girls. Ono woman was from the
country. They found their own race's
statistics also.
Much is to be learned at the exhibit,
so ithe visitors say, even by the moth
er who already knows that baby's
clothes should be simple, milk should
be heated to 140 or 145 degrees for
twenty minutes to bo germ proof and
plenty of fresh air and simple toys
make baby healthy, if not wealthy and
wise. For instance, how many per
sons know that the skin-surface on
the arms of a 2-moni:hs-old baby is
three-fourths that of the trunk? This
is ono thing the exhibit is telling
mothers: Cover the baby's arm for
this reason.

SISTER HIS HIRTHIUY PRESENT
Robert W. Jones, Jr., Surprised This
Morning lij- Hatty's Arrival.
When Robert W. Jones, Jr., awoke
this morning, the fourth anniversary
of his birth, he knew that mamma and
daddy were going to hate something
nice for him or maybe even Santa
Claus had made a special trip from
the North Pole to bring him a gift out
of season. For birthdays come but
once a year, and Robert had been a
good boy.
And Robert wasn't disappointed. The
gift that had come in the early morn
ing while he slept was better than any
thing he had dreamed of. It was a
little sister, asleep in a crib.
Robert is proud of her and intends
to take good care of her. He likes her
so well that he is perfectly willing to
share his birthday with her all the rest
of his life.
Little Miss Jones and her mother
are both quite well. And the elder
Robert W. Jones ask him. The Co
lumbia Tribune, of which he is city
editor, was expected to sparkle today
with even more than its usual bright
ness.

SOMEONE TOOK RABIES' ELACS
And l-'C Children Less Than :t Had
To Co Without Them.
Somewhere in Columbia are 12C
stray flags. The Flag Day Committee
for Baby Week in Columbia bought
SC4 flags, and there are in the city
only 73S babies less than ."! years old.
The flags were given to the Boy
Scouts for distribution, but as the
birth register furnishes only a few
addresses tho boys were forced to In
quire at each house as to the where
abouts of babies. The result was
that many homes without babies ac
cepted flags, and many homes with
babies did not receive flags.
Mrs. R. D. Miller, speaking for Uie
Fortnightly Club, which originated
the Flag Day plan, says: "If you
have the baby, don't envy the woman
who got the flag. She no"ds compen
sation." Alumnus of 'C3 Dies.
