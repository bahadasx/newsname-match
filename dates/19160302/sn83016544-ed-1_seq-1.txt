MeKAY MYSTERY UNSOLVED
Siwriff Lira Ritarns Convinnd That
John McKay is Drtwnd.
Sheriff Lien returned this noon
from Susie Islaad having spent se­
veral days in that vicinity investiga­
ting the mysterious dissappearance
of John McKay. He learned that
McKay and Falkner quit fishing on
December 13th last and after set­
tling up their accounts, McKay left
in his skiff on the following day for
his own home on an island less than
a half mile away, intending to lift a
couple nets on the way.
At McKay's home he found no
evidence of his having been there
for a long time, goods piled up on
and around the stove, and the bed
showed no signs of having been
used. His cooking utensils were all
ship-shape and it looked as if he had
not lived there for a long time and
had only been there to get some ar­
ticles he wanted from time to time.
Sheriff Lien believes that McKay
is drowned and that the body will
be washed up on the shores of one
of the islands in the spring unless
the current has carried the body too
far out into the open lake.

Rude best individual costume, An­
dy Lindberg best comic costume,
Mrs. John Bohlin.
Lunch was served at midnight
and the committee in charge of the
lunch deserves special mention for
the efficient way the "mob" (no of­
fense intended, no other word ex­
presses the crowd) was served.
At an early hour the dancing
ceased and all departed for their re­
spective homes, weary but well sat­
isfied.
