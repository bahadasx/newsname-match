Chas. G. Sanders for Sheriff
Chas. G. Sanders, of Mountain
Grove township, announces him
self this week for the office of
Sheriff of Wright county, subject
to the will of the Republican vot
ers at the August primary. Mr
Sanders was the Republican
nominee for Sheriff in 1912, and
went down in defeat with the
Democratic landslide of that
and he thinks that the Republi
cans should nominate him this
year and give him another
chance at the office, as he believ
es the Republicans will win the
entire ticket this year. Mr.
Sanders was deputy Sheriff un
der Joe Hensley, and also served
as deputy under Wm. Woods.
He is well and favorably known
all over the county, and he made
one ot the oesc omcers, ana
caught as many criminals during
his term as deputy Sheriff any
other officer of the county had
ever done. He is also a deserv
ing man, perfectly honest and
sober. He has had . the con
stable's office at Norwood and
is now night-watchman at Mtn
Grove. Mr. Sanders is a strong
man, and if nominated will,
doubtless, be elected this fall,
and he will appreciate any favors
shown him. He was a Mansfield
visitor yesterday. -

ell Mavcs. secretary of the State
Board of Agriculture, we have
received a copy of the 1915 Year

preserving. Many items of int
erest are contained therein
E. G. Bennett, State Dairy

"Missouri, with its vast e.x.
panse of open territory known
as the Ozark country, offers
many inducements to those want

Jewell Mays, Secretary of the
State Board of Agriculture,
says:
" 'The Ozarks of Opportunity'
offer many thousands of chances.
The least boosted and lowest
priced hinds ate today in the

ple mid big-hearted and hospit
able people in the 'Ozarks of

Mining News
A trip to Punching Camp by
Rufus Chandler and Frank
Scheuermann,
As we go east on the Frisco
railroad and just before we come
to the overhead bridge, on the
north side of the track is found a
foreign stratum of rock, a flint
lime and tiff. Such outcroppings
of rock seem to be strangers in
these parts. There seems to be
an opening to the north and south
and John Carter may do well to
sink a test hole on his residence
lot near the right-of-way. As we
go east about 20 rods on tne
south side of the track, we come
to an iron ore deposit. Large
chunks lay along the bank here,
If this ore proves to be of a high
quality an iron ore mine might be
started here. As we travel east
and at the west end of the blue
cut on the north of the right-of-
way we come to a fissure run of
silicate; this can be seen on the
bank, and a shaft had been sunk
there and several cars of silicate
shipped. The Frisco railroad
owns this 40 acres of land; half
lies on the north side and half on
the south side of the track. This
same fi-sure run goes through
the Fellows miuing property to
the south and angles through the
W. O Williams farm. Now as we
go ea-d and just before we get to
Coker, we go into the George W.
Miller land to look at his mining
prospects and a cave that he is
developing, but Rufus says:
"Here's where I'm lost! I can
not get my bearings." So we
traveled up one rut and down an
other, and oh, such deep canyons
and golcbes, with ice hanging
from the larger cliffs. Frank get
dry for a drink, and, while down
in the deepest gulch. Rufus was
going to push a volcanic boulder,
is big as a house, down the hill;
so, while Frank was climbing up
tiie'm'ouutiiti side, Rufus called
to him: "Come here!" Frank
thought it was money Rufus had
found, but it was nothing but
lead nuggtts. We felt good in
finding this mineral and conclud
el the whole mountain side was
good ground to prospect on. Here
are monster volcanic boulders,
some as a house. A lvgiment of
soldiers could hide behind some
of those layers. Now we travel
on to see if we can find the Miller
diggings. At last we come to the
place where Mr.Miller is mining.

oks good and seems to bo uiin-

X, L. Fellows, a Spriugtield
wagon maker, has owned what
s known as the Fellows farm 2
miles from Manstield for
the last 35 or 40 years. Some
i years ago a stranger drifted
onto this farm and commenced
to dig for ore. His success at
tirst was limited, and he will be
remembered by some of the old
settlers as one who loosed line
anything but an experienced
minor. Later, however, he took
out a good many tnousanas oi
pounds of ore and hauled it a'
way. His prospect was named
by the neighbors the "Barlow
Diggings," comparing his efforts
to a Barlow knife. Some years
later a shaft was sunk about 90
feet on this p'ace, striking sme

work in case he decides to de
velop the mine.
