RESOLUTION NOT REPORTED
Foreign Affairs Committee Howls
Down Attempt to Bring Out Meas
ure Warning Americans.
The Presidrnt and the leaders of ('on -
gress have failed thus far to R;re itn
rea rd to a vote ,on the submarine issue.
The elidinz of a lav of many % on
ferences found the President determined
to foce the Issue- presented by his lettsr
to the Rules Comtittee of the ifouse and
standing firm against any comproi.
A decisive vote on the resolution warning
Americans off armed passenger ships was
insisted upon by the President.
The constei nation of Congress was
zreater yesterday even than it was on tile
night when th, President unexpectedlyi
sent his letter to Acting Chairman Pou
Many attempts were made by the leaders
to get together and decide upon some
definite program. but last night all these
efforts had failed and the House leaders
decided to send ('hairman IFlood. of the
Foreign Affairs Committee, to the Whit. i
Ilouse this nornltin to see if a more
definite understanding w tit the Prsi
dent cutld be reached.
Attempt Howled Down.
At a meeting of the liouse Committee
on Foreign Affairs an attempt was made
to yield to the President's suggestion and
report out the McLemore resolution,
warning Amei loans off armed ships.
This attempt was howled down in the
committee, and the ineident disclosed the
fact that only four of the sixteen mem
bers who were present seemed dispesed
Itw-Eafil by the fresident's wishes.
At the same time on the floor of the
House and in the lobibies -onfident asser
tions- the sane kind that were heard a
week or more ago-were b-ing made by
Iemoc itic leaders that if the arleI
merchantman resolutions were iimmni
ately put to a \ote. as the Prceident had
requeste d. they would he pasedI h t he

into its own hands." said Mr. 'ou.
This tatement by Mi. Pou had the
effect of inflaming sentiment among
the Democratwc revollers. They said
thiat action as suggested by Mr. Pou
would be a revolutionary proceediing
and would tend further to complicate
the situatioi.
Administration leaders were not so
cock-sure today as they were last
night, but they still insisted that the
President would easily lairy the day
both inl the hlouse and SenaLte. Many
are iiilined to believe that the Presi

after the firt flurr over his extraordi

one careful estimate prepared by ad
ministration leaders in Congress
showed that there would be a margin
of at least sixteen votes against the
resolution in the House. The Presi
dent's adviseri realize, how-ever, that
this figure is altogether too close and
the Congress leaders contend that a
victory for the President by such a
narrow margin would be more disas
