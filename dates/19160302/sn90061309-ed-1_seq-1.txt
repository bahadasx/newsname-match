Euchre Party
Mrs. Thomas Mendenhall Boul
ware has long been noted as a
hostess so it was with u thrill of
pleasure mid the knowledge of a
jgood time in store that each of the
;u"S's .-Hide! their way to the
beautiful home Wednesday after
where a Military Euchre was given
in honor ol Mrs. Aaron Boulware
and Murk Hoblett of Lincoln III.,
Mrs. Amundson of Rose Bud Mont.,
and Mrs. C. S McKinney of St.
Louis
The house was a mass of potted
plants and spring blossoms. Carna
tions, Sweet peas and Jonquils in
every nook and corner made you
forget the snow outside and imagine
spring had opened her portals and
brought perfume and flowers to
welcome you. And would you be
lieve it the son was there at least
Mrs Ainundson's son w is there to
make his first bow to Monroe's
four hundred who received him
with open arms on account of his
('harming mother who was Miss
Elizabeth Boulware before her
marriage. The ladies played the
game with reol sport until Mrs.
Boulware served a delicious
luncheon need we say they did it
justice and proclaimed it a feast
fur the God's. Tennyson has said "A
thing of beauty is n jay forever"
after attending the party we agree
with the poet. Each of us departed
with regret that it was so -non over.
But in memories casket we will
drop aim' her gem Mrs Ba.il.vare
conquered all by her gracious
maimer and genuine hospitality.
The things cf life
Are made worth while
By the glad hand shake
And a welcome smile. .
