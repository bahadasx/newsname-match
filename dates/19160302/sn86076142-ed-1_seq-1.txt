to be Repulsed
LONDON, Mar. 2. The Herman offensive on Verdun has been re-
Humed, but apparently not on the scale or with the force exerted dur-
, Ins the early day of the drive. It reopened on the plain of Woevre
east of Verdun. The Germans made a drive on the French at Fresnes
and penel rated the French positions at Koine points. Paris, however,
asserts that they were promptly ejected. The French took the offen-
hIvh at Douaumont. Berlin nays the attacks were fruitless. Reports
from Dutch sources Bay the German drive will be resumed from the
northeast. Ninety thousand men are concentrated near Busey, behind
Fort Vaux., The French loupes at Verdun are officially placed as not
high. The estimates of German losses are from 125,000 to 130,000,
according to entente sources. The Germans assert that the casual-
ties of the attacking armies were surprisingly small.

CAIRO, Egypt, Mar. 2. Egypt Is

is going on along its frontier. Rumors
of the most sensational kinds are clr
culated, but there can 6e no doubt
that the military authorities are run

Ins lo travel by railway to any sta

to obtain a special permit which i
only obtained after searching inquiries
on the part of the mCltary officials
The permit may be either temporary
for one trip only or permanent,
for such as require to pay frequent
visits to Port Said or Suez for bust
ness reasons. Any permit is revocable
on the Instant at the will of the offi
cials.
In the case of foreigners, applica
tlon must first be made to the pro

forwarded to the public security de
Dartment for investigation, lleforc
returning from any place in the canal
gone, the traveler must obtain a re
turn permit, properly stamped by tnc
governor of Port Said or Suez or the

the canal zone and desirous of travel

MIGRATORY BIRD LAW
CONTINUES IN FORCE
SEASON IS CLOSED THROUGHOUT
THE UNITED STATES UNTIL
NEXT FALL
tprrtal lo lha Boaaosa.1
WASHINGTON. Mar. 2 A mislead
Ing statement has recently become
current in newspapers of the Missis
sippi Valley and elsewhere, to the ef
fect that the department of agricul
ture has suspended the enforcement
of the federal regulations under the
migratory bird law and. by this means
has enabled sportsmen, under state
laws, to shoot wild fowl the coming
spring.
Under the federal regulations as
they now stand, the season on all mi
gratory wild fowl is closed until next
autumn throughout the United States.
Federal inspectors and wardens are
required, and other Interested In the
protection of wild fowl are req.iesled,
to report to the depeartment of agri
culture all cases of violations of the
regulations, in order that proper ac
tion may be taken.
The department of agriculture har
no power to suspend the law or to par
don violations of the regulations.
Doubtless the erroneous impression,
on which the newspaper statements
are based, has grown out of the pen
dency of litigation involving the con
stitutionality of the act of congress
approved March 4, 19111, under which
the regulations were promulgated. The
lower federal courts disagreed as to
the validity of the statute and the Is
sue was carried to the supreme court
of the United Stntes. The case was
argued In the a.ipreme court In Oeto
her, 1915, but has not been decided.
Following the lower court diclsions,
congress appropriated money for the
purpose of continuing the enforcement
of the law. The department of agrl
culture is hound to report to the de
partment of Justice violations of the
regulations if the supreme court
should declnre the law constitutional.
All persons should, therefore, be
warned of the danger they incur from
failure to abide bv the regulations.

dent's demand for defeat of the

announcing from the floor that he Is not in accord with the president,
proposed, however, that the senate take an adjournment Instead of
another recess, and thereby get into a new legislative day, relieving
the parliamentary situation which thus far has "held Sentaor Gore's
resolution from coming to a vote.
The administration leaders are confident that they have enough
votes to defeat the Gore resolution and demonstrate to Germany that
dissensions against the president's foreign policy did not have the
support of congress. Senator Stone said framing a substitute for all
the pending resolutions was the, only hope of settlement.
The president, Republican Leader Mann and the house will dis-
cuss the attitude of the Republicans this afternoon. It la at the prest-
dent's request. The president intends to place the issue squarely be-
fore the Republicans in an effort to gain their support.

LEEDS, Eng., Mar. 2. The direc
tors of the British Dyes company,
which hopes to supplant the German
dye makers in the production of aniline
colors, are pushing the construction
of their mammoth factories on the 250
acre site allotted them by the British
government at Huddersfield. A con
siderable part of the new works will
be in operation during the Bprine.
In the meantime the production of
Vegetable dyes in Great Britain has
greatly increased, and aniline dyes
are being made at home in smaller
factories and imported In unprecedent
ed quantities from Switzerland. As
England formerly sent the raw ma
terials of the aniline dyes to Ger
many to be returned to her as the fin
ished product, so now she is sending
these raw materials to Switzerland,
and many British dye users have sign
ed contracts to continue the Import
of Swiss dyes even after the war is
over.
GERMAN CAPITAL TO

FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE

BUDAPEST, via London, Mar. 2.
The action of the Hungarian parli-
ment in consenting to a Dili permitting;
uerman capital to exploit tne new oil
fields In Transylvania has aroused a 1
flood of criticism. The oil fields, tin-,
exploited as yet, were discovered only ;
three years ago, but (here has been
widespread public belief that they j
would prove to be a natural treasure!
worth untold millions to Hungary, i
Concessions for their exploitation have;
now been turned over to the Deutsche
Bank at Berlin, In return for the lnt
ter's promise to Invest $5,000,000 in
the work of development. This Is
characterized by the opposition as
"selling our birthright for a mess of
pottage."
The center of each of the two Tran
sylvanian fields consists of a group'
of oil springs "gushing up from the
earth in a quantity sufficient to sup-l
ply the whole of Central Europe with;
gas and oil not only for lighting but!
also for industrial purposes." 1
Just how far the concessions to the
Deutsche Gsnk go, is not yet clear,
but there appears to be no doubt that ;
they will give German capitalists n
clear advantage and control In a field!

build m a purely nnlioiial enterprise.,

Independence party raised its usual
objections, urging that "the oil fields
should be exploited and organized by
the state in order that they should
serve as a national source of wealth,
and thus replace the dear coal, mostly
Imported from Germany." One of the
speakers declared "this oil will now
fall to the Germans, who will take
care that -the gas will not be any
cheaper than the coal."
One of the newspapers has since
explained the transaction in an in
terview with Tlsza. in which he says
tfcnt the transaction was necessary
because Hungary has - not enough
money to develop the oil fields herself.
