Executive Serves Notice on Con*
gress That He Expects a
Record Vote,
GERMAN NEGOTIATIONS
WILL WAIT ON RESULT
Congress Will Meet Today, Fac­
ing a Clear Cut Situation With
Wilson.
Washington, March L—'President
Wilson served notice on congress to­
night that he will consent to nothing
less than a record vote on the anti
administration resolutions to warn
Americans off tae armea snips of Eu­
ropean belligerents before he goes on
with the German submarine negotia­
tions.
No compromise proposition, such as
a vote of confidence in the presidents
foreign policy, will be acceptable.
Such an action, it is held, might be
construed in Berlin as justifying the
opinion that the president lacks the
support of congress and his own par­
ty, in his demands for a full observ­
ance of international law, while its
only purpose would be to afford mem­
bers of congress a way to avoid re­
cording their position before the coun­
try on the straight out. and out ques­
tion.
President Wilson made his position
clear to congressional leaders tonight
in unequivocal terms, as a climax to
a day of confusion, uncertainty and
political maneuvering that opened his
lirst real tight with congress.

As emphasized, the president abso­
lutely refuses to continue the negotia­

Meanwhile, the pending Lusitania

Practically in control of the ma­

the president, and still save their po­

Vice Rampant
in theMill City
Says a Report
Minneapolis Conditions Scored by
Statement From Seven Wom­
en's Organizations.
Minneapolis, Minn.,'March 1.—A co­
operative committee representing sev­
en of the largest women's organiza­
tions in Minneapolis, in a statement
today to the public announced that af­
ter months of investigation, they can
say that recent startling revelations
of vice conditions in this city "only
skip the surface of actual conditions."
That young girls are unsafe alone
on the streets at night, that a chain
of hotels is being operated wholly
by profits* gained from vice, and that
taxicab drivers are co-operating with
ikeepers of resorts in luring young
girls from their homes were among
the findings of the committee.
Another vice investigation was be­
gun by county authorities this week,
after the 15-year-old daughter of a
minister, who had been missing from
her home for several weeks, told of
being forced into a life of shame.
MERIT. NOT
RECOpU
Navy Board Would Change Plan
of Promotion in the Ser­
vice.
YOUNG MEN HAVE
BETTER OPPORTUNITY
Washington, March 1.—Promotion
of naval ollicers by selection instead
of, by seniority, \an, increase pfv 50
per'^iilfiri'officers of ail glides,"cre­
ation of a war reserve list, and res­
toration of the popular old rank ol'
commodore are proposed in a bill
drafted toy the navy personnel board
and transmitted to congress today by
Secretary Daniels.
The measure, the result ol' two
years of study and work by the board,
is designed to increase the efficiency
of the .service, put men in command­
ing positions at an earlier age and
open the way for rise of subordinate
officers now virtually barred from
hope of promotion.
[Under the plan, all officers above
the rank of lieutenant would be sub­
ject to promotion by selection upon
passage of the bill, the selection be­
ing made from each grade by offi­
cers of the ranks above.
The board reported that after care­
ful consideration it was convinced the
system of promotions by seniority
must be abandoned.
Attached to the report is an appen­
dix, dealing with tlae need of the ma­
rine corps, brought about by increases
in the navy personnel. This proposes
that the total number of enlisted
men of the marine corps shall be in­
creased to 20 per cent of the total
authorized strength of the navy, and
that the number of marine corps offi­
cers shall be 4 per cent of the au­
thorized number of enlisted men.
Legislative framework for a far
reaching industrial and technical re­
serve to support the nation's fighting
lines in war times was sketched into
the house military committee's mili­
tary preparedness program today. It
was suggested by Representative
Kahn of California as an amendment
to the provision in the pending army
increase bill for a quartermasters
corps reserve, and was adopted with­
out objection.
The plan contemplates not only an
effort to enlist in the reserve in peace
time, teamsters, merchants, railroad
men, chauffeurs and other non-com­
batant forces necessary to an army,
but extends the scope of the reserve
system to include civilian aviators,
ordnance engineers, workers in muni­
tions plants, telephone and telegraph
operators and mechanics, civil engin­
eers, electrical engineers, and mem­
bers of every other civil profession
or occupation whose services would
be useful to the army in war.
Reservists of this character would
be liable for assignment to duty by
the war department in time of war.

Taking up Mr. ltoot's charges
against the present national adminis­
tration, Mr. Glynn answered each
point. '.He also took Mr. Root to tasK
for his speeches in the United States
senate and for his acts as secretary
of the United States.
The federal reserve act, and the
Underwood tariff were approved, and
foreign affairs and preparedness were
dwelt upon by the former governor.
"Four years ago," he said, "this na
Liotf -'cmuimtted its- earn and- w£lfure

ocratic party has been true to its
trust. It has preserved peace, observ­
ed international laws and followed

marine in the Mediterranean some

Recently the Austrian government

the submarine commander mistook
the American ship for a hostile mer­

that the master of the Petrolite vol­

The version of the Petrolite's crew

Washington, Mar. i.—Generally
good business conditions throughout
the country are rellected in reports
of Federal Reserve agents made pub­
lic tonight by the Federal Reserve
board. Growing scarcity of raw ma­
terials used in many American indus­
tries is noted, however, and the
southern agents predict an increase
in cotton acrerge this year, unless
steps are taken to prevent it.
From New York comes the report
that thore arc more products and
workers in that district, and that the
industrial activity there is of record
character. Manufacturers of automo­
biles, tools and firearms, and the roll­
ing mills, show the greatest increases
in production.
Scarcity of basic raw materials,
the Chicago agents
say,
are receiving
the earnest attention of manufactur­
ing industries dependent on them.
Reports from the farming sections of
the district indicates a reduced wheat
acreage this year, but the farmers
are said to have an increased pur­
chasing power. The automobile in­
dustry is at a record pace.
Cold weather has retarded grain
shipments in the Minneapolis district,
and to a considerable extent the lum­
ber wholesale business.
Car shortage, the report says, is
causing difficulties and the coal situa­
tion threatened at one time to be­
come serious.
Prospects for the spring are called
excellent.

The Missouri has remained practic­

Young3town, O., March 1.—An ex­

London, March 1.—The Germans in the battle scarred region of Verdun,
continue their bombardment west of the Meuse, in the region between
Malancourt and Forges across the riv er east about Vaux and Dam Loup,
and against French trenches in the Woevre region, southeast of Verdun.
Their big offensive, however, so far as infantry attacks are concerned,
has ceased at least for the moment. Whether it will begin again or
whether the Germans will rest content with the point of vantage they
have gained is not indicated in the official report of either Berlin or
Paris.
Unofficial advices from Berlin have stated that the German plan of
campaign has been primarily based on the bombardment of sectors they
desired to obtain, and it is possible that they may now be drawing up
their big guns to capture positions, with the object of shelling points
near their objective—Verdun.

Artillery Duels.
To the east of Verdun, around Pon
a-Mouson, the French have bombard­
ed the German positions heavily in
Pe Lere wood, and near Thaia court.
Artillery duels have been in progress
in Alsace. There has been no re­
sumption of German attacks against
the French in the Champagne region.
While nothing of especial import­
ance has taken place along the Brit*
ish part of the line, the effect of the
German offensive in the Verdun re­
gion is shown in the lengthening of
their fronts, in order to release the
French for the reinforcement of the
army opposing the German advance.
Little is going on in Russia, except
isolated bombardments and infantry
attacks and air raids.
Ultimatum to Portugal,
