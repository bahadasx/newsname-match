The convention also adopted a reso
lution recommending' the re-election of
Norman E. Mack of Buffalo as lcm
ocrutic national commilteeinan.
The delegates to the national con
vention who comprise Now York's
"big four" were unpledged but were
nominated with the understanding
that they are to work for a second
term for Mr. Wilson.
The keynote speech, delivered by
former Governor Martin II. Glynn,
as permanent chairman, aroused much
enthusiasm.
At the conclusion of the speech the
convention adopted u resolution pro
viding for tho distribution of one mil
lion copies throughout the country.
"I'eui-c Above All Tilings."
With reference to preparedness, the
plaintiff says that although Ameri
cans "desire peace above nil things,
but net pence at any price, the peo
ple of this country should enforce
upon I heir representatives, tho neces
sity of making ample preparations
"for sustaining the honor of our gov
ernment, for the protection of our
citizens and for the creation and
maintenance of an army and navy
amply adequate for these purposes und
commensurate with the wealth and
greatness of our people."
Coder the bearing, "America First,"
tho plaintiff says:
"Peace with all; entangling iillianees
with none.
"We denounce the insidious efforts
of those who pretend utter la months
of silence to find in treaty arrange
ments and in international conven
tions for peaceful arbitration grounds
for direct interference with the affairs
of European nations by this country."
About Mexican Policy.
Commenting on the Mexican situa

and friendly feeling between the great
governments of South America and
our own which will not only further
and extend commercial intercourse he
twoen the Cnited States and South
America, but will also unite those gov
ernments with ours in upholding and
maintaining the Monroe doctrine and
not leave to the Cnited States alone
the upholding of it in the future."

WASHINGTON, March L After
a scries of hot exchanges
Mining a half dozen representative
over principles involved In reimburse,
incut of citizens of the southern stales
fur property seized by the Union
troops during the Civil war, the house
toiiuv passed a bill to restore the
right of the court of claims to con
sider claims of such reimbursement
aggregating JMI.OUO. An amendment
adopted would require claimants to
show proof of loyalty to the Cnlon.
Representatives Heflin of Alabama
und Clark of Florida resented state
ments by Representatives Munn ct

Stafford of Wisconsin, claiming they
were attempting to raise sectional
prejudice over the bill. Represent

who shouted thut "nobody but tt cow

bill was "serking to make the enter

were disloyal and thut is the only
purpose of the bill,"
