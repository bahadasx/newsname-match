Senator Gore succeeded in getting
his resolution before the senate, (S.
Con. Res. 14), warning "passengers
to forbear to exercise the right to
travel upon an armed vessel of any
belligerent power, armed for offen
sive or defensive purposes." That's
neutrality pure and simple. Keep
away from the enemies' ships and
you won't be submarined.
Good permanent roads would be
the making of the town and country
surrounding.
Push the dairy interests in Audrain.
The poultry interests are pushing
themselves.
The Senator from Washington in
S.Res.108 before the Senate Feb. 25,

to declare war, to raise and support
armies, and to provide and maintain
a navy." No severance of diplomatic
relations can be had by the Executive
until after the advice and consent of
Congress.

FARM and STOCK.

will move to Montana on account of
his wife's health, tlio he retains his
good farm here.
A prolific source of trouble and
disappointment to farmers is cheap
seed. Generally cheap seed means im
pure seed. It stands to reason that
an adulterated article can be sold
cheaper. Seed that tests low, that is
mixed with other seeds, can always
be bought cheaper than seed that is
guaranteed or which, has behind it
the reliability of a good seed house.
The axiom that the best is the cheap
est applies to the purchase of seed.
Our neighbors tell of an autoist
who stuffs his worn out inner tubes
with sausage, claiming his sausage
keeps better and he also gets more
mileage out of it. Another neighbor
says he gets his idea from the butch
er who buys up cast of casings and
converts them into sausage for local
consumption. Don't get scared, this
happened in Shelbina and Paris.

RUSH HILL LETTER
Rush Hill, Mo., Feb. 29. We
have had one continuous round of
mud and sleet. The streets have
been so sloppy one could hardly get
around. But our street commissioner,
Chas. Kepllnger, has done his duty
in trying to keep the streets lined
up and the ice cleared away.
The ladies of the new Union
Church have bought, made and put
op the curtains that divide the main
auditorium from the Sunday school
rooms. The curtains certainly look
nice. These ladies know just how
to do things, and with the help of
a few boys who did ne heavy work
are deserving of a great deal of
praise. That's what we need in this
world more than anything elese, a
little more praise and encouragement,
especially when it's well earned. Let's
have more good words and not so
much knocking. Don't knock. If
your mouth needs exercise, chew
gum. (And we don't advertise any
certain gum, jst so it's gum).
Pete Erdel, our hardware man,
is putting up a Band and gravel
building. Chas. Keplinger is doing
the carpenter work. Pete is one of
the best hardware men in the State,
not only in hardware, but anywhere .
you put him. He's a rustler. Wish
our town had more like him.
W. S. Doolin, one of our hustling
merchants, has installed an elevator I
in his store. . Using his upper
rooms for furniture and undertak
ing. He has received most of his
stock of furniture and is ready to
handle the business. W. S. is an
other hustler all right.
We are to have a new blacksmith.
We have not learned his name.
There's always room for one more.
We understand the brick building
owned by Dr. Hill of St. Louis is to
be overhauled and a stock of mer
chandise put in this spring. Who
says this town Is not on the boom?
Our school hasn't closed yet, but
we understand our skating rinks and
picture shows are to close on account
of the measles. We are not afraid
of these as we have had everything
but the grouches and blues, and as
the town board has forbidden these
to exist in this town we feel easy.

Awful Happening
lu Pike County
A Neighbor Shoots a Mother While.
Her Rubles Hide.
Frank Snedeker, a young farmer,
and his wife, Mary, were shot dead
late Monday afternoon on their farm
eight miles north of Vandalla.
Van Wilson, 20 years old, has con
fessed to neighbors that he killed
Snedeker and his wife.
Wilson gives no motive for his ac
tion. Sheriff W. P. Hawkins and Cor
oner James H. Hendrix, of Bowling
Green, had not arrived when Wilson
made his confession. Wilson is high
ly respected in the neighborhood, and
his confession caused a sensation.
Mrs. Snedeker sacrificed her life
to save her two children. After see
ing her husband shot down at his
front gate, she had time to flee as
the slayer rushed toward the house,
but waited to hide her two children,
8 and 6 years old.. After placing
them behind a dresser, warning them
t0 "be 6od and keeP 8tln fo" little
while," she turned to escape, only to
be shot down.
Dying, she dragged herself to the
teleInone nd Pents.
"I'm shot dying Frank
dead!" she gasped.
is
Mrs. Snedeker died before help ar
rived, having been struck by three
bullets. Two shots struck her
husband-.
The children were found hiding be
hind the dresser, unable to tell what
had happened except that "Mamma
put us here and then something went
boom boom."
Mrs. Snedeker formerly was Miss
Mary Lowe and lived near Frank
ford. They were married in St. Louia
in 1904.
Dr. J. B. Hawkins of Mexico knows
the families of all the above parties. .
It is in the neighborhood of where he
practiced medicine many years.
THAT BOX SUPPER.
Since those folks over at Maple
Grove are too modest, we are going to
tell of the Leap Year Box Supper.
One continual laugh made us feel ten
years younger. The Coon Creek
Courtship, Th Irish Comedy, and the
"Old Maids Club," were excellent, as
were also the male quartette, Darkey
Sermon, and that new invention, the
spanking machine" sure works like
a charm. Ye progressive teachers and.
fond parents will do well to indulge.
Sallie Grindstone had one time to
get Johnny Overalls to propose but
when he got started he did it right
The Sermon couldn't have been
better and we wonder If Pat and his
faithful Mary Ann ever have discov
ered "who got the pig". We truly
believe the "old maids club", a good
thing and sincerely hope Maple Grove
and community will encourage those
dear sisters in their efforts this Leap
Tear. We'd like to jine but since
Betsy Boblnet had such a time we
will just start a club all our own.
Would like to mention all would
space permit. Those taking part were,
the teacher, Miss Nina Beta, Misses
Wreatha Stuart, Llllle Dalhem, Nellie
Herron Minnie Conklln, Lucy Brown,
Florence and Julia Fecht, Messrs.
Winfield, Jamea and Harold Stuart,
Dee Johnson, John Triplett, Willie
and Lawrence Fecht. Carter Ham
ilton. Mrs. Eugene Sullivan made
a number one auctioneer. The boys
took twenty-nine boxes and alx pies,
nice ones, too. The girls, how they
did bid up was good to see. Twenty
five dollars, now say the girls can't
do something. 200 people present.
Three cheers for Maple Grove. LWJ,
