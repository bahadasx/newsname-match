The Basket Ball Game
The basketball game Saturday night
between the Jasper Giants and the
Nevada All Stars was interesting not
because of Jaspers showing for the
Giants did not have a show after the
lirst five minutes Those All Stars are
well named It looked like the fastest
and best trained team Mia has graced
the Jasper court in four or lle years
They were fine gentlemanly fellows
and played a clean game Captain
Frank Steiner of the Giants said Of
course we got a licking but that is not
the worst of it To play a good game
and be beaten isnt so bad but to play
a poor game because of lack of practice
when we know we can play better ball
is what hurts
That is the Giants alibi and the
ground is well taken for the boys have
had little or no practice all season
The Jasper lineup was Steiner Owings
Rue Webb Roy Bowers and Glenn
Buzzard Virgil Carter was nmpite
The Nevada referee was also a live one
and was right on top of every play
The All Stars hae beaten Mulberry
and they also beot the Tola team who
claims the state championship
