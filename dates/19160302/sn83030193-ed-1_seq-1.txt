WILSON REAFFIRMS STAND
WASHINGTON, March 2. The armed ship issue suddenly blazed
up in the Senate to-day -with the most sensational debate of tKe'$slor?i
in tvlijcli Senator tijre. Democrat and author of a resolution to Warn
Americans, off belligerent vessels, repeated what he characterized as a
report that President Wilson had told certain Congress leaders that vyar
between the United States and Germany "might not be undesirable,
and might result in advancing civilization by bringing about the end of
the Luiropcau war by midsummer."
Chairman Stone of the Foreign Relation Committee emphatically
denied that the President ever had expressed any such sentiment in his
hearing and Senator James, another Administration leader, demanded
to know why Senator Gore had not soiiglil to confirm the report from
the President himself.
