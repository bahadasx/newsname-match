resolution up for action as Boon as
possible, but not probably today," said

have got the votes in the Senate
to smash it."

Senators Say Issue is Most
Important Matter Be
fore Congress.
President Wilson and the Republ
ican leader Mann, of the House, will
discuss the attitude of the Republi
cans 011 the armed ship issue at Ave
o'clock this afternoon at the Presi
dent's request.
The President Intends to place the
issue squarely before- the Republi
cans In an effort to gain their support.
The announcement of this confer
ence aroused much discussion over
whether the administration forces had
lost ground, in the House, which they
hoped to overcome with Republican
..votes, or -whether the Presidept, .con
sidering the question entirely non-par
tisan, wanted to inform the leaders on
all sides. The latter view was predomi
nant.
Senator Gore declared today on the
floor of the Senate that the impelling
reason for his course was a report
that President Wilson had told certain
Congressmen that a war between the
United States and Germany "might not
be ungrateful and mlght result in ad
vancing civilization by bringing about
the end of the European war by mid
summer".
Senator Stone vehemently denied It
Senator Gore declared that at the
proper time he would put squarely be
fore the Senate whether the sinking of
an armed merchant vessel by subma
rine would be considered sufficient
cause'for war.
