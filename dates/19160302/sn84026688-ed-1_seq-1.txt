| AN ALIBI FOR BOND |
"While your mother and 1 arc away
will be a good time to have the car
put into shape." This remark ad
dressed by Frank Rond, Sr., to Frank
Bond, Jr., on the eve of the former's
departure for a week-end trip to tne
country was the wet olanket upon the
plans that the younger Bond had been
laying for his own week-end diversion.
When the bolt fell he was driving the
car In question home from business
and to vent his feelings he sounded
the horn with unusual vigor.
"There are several little things that
need attention and there will be all
day Saturday to do it in.”
Bond, Junior, merely grunted and
turned an unnecessary sharp corner.
That night he took little interest in
the plans of his elders for their short
week-end trip. His mind was too full '
of his own plans that had been frus
trated. He had been so confident when
he had laid them before Molly, and
Molly’s blue eyes had danced so mer
rily as she made plans for the picnic
luncheon which she would prepare
with her own fair hands, if only he
hadn’t been so sure, if he had only left
a loophole through which he could
make his exit.
With the explanation that he was
going "down town for a while,” he
sauntered out after dinner in the di
rection of Molly’s house.
Just as he passed Gink’s garage
Bond, junior, had an inspiration—not
a very brilliant one, but one which,
like the proverbial straw, was at least
worth snatching at.
Frank sauntered into the gloomy,
badly lighted concrete interior, care
fully stamping out the cigarette that
he had been smoking ns he moodily
regarded the “No Smoking sign.
Ginks. Junior, approached him, wiping
gasoline from his hands.
"Say, Ginks,” Frank said, with what
he took to be an interesting tone of
despondency in his voice, "the gover
nor Is going to bring the ear around
early in the morning to have some re
pairs done —nothing that needs to he
done Immediately, but some little jobs.
Listen to me! You can’t fix it. You
haven’t time. In fact, you won’t have
room in the garage for it.”
“Wake up.” muttered Rond. "I said
you wouldn’t be able to fix the car,
and, by tho way, any time yon want to
use my baseball pass it’s yours.* Do
you get me?”
Ginks grinned. “I get you. Got a
lady friend?”
“Never you mind what I’ve got. Just
you take tho hint if you know what’s
healthy for you.”
“Well, of course,” stammered Ginks,
junior, ”1 know how you feel about it.
Got a girl of my own.”
Rather resenting this piece of fa
miliarity on the part of the young son
of the garage owner. Bond wont on
toward the home of Molly. There was
an air of thwarted ambition in Bond s
manner that night that rather egged
Molly on to unusual vivacity and sym
pathy. On leaving he remembered the
loophole.
“It’s barely possible,” lie remarked,
wearily regarding the brim of his hat,
“that the car will he out of commis
sion tomorrow. I’m awfully sorry, and
if it is I’ll let you know very early.”
The plan of Bond, junior, aided and
abetted by Ginks, junior, worked ad
mirably in the morning and Bond,
senior, ran the car back into his gar
age without the shadow of a suspi
cion.
Saturday was fair and the shoe
string that held the disconnected 1
speedometer was strong enough for 1
Its task and did not give way. Molly i
was especially charming.
Monday tho car was safely locked in
the Bond garage, and Mr, and Mrs,
Rond had come home in high glee.
There was no hint of trouble until
Tuesday noon when Mrs. Rond at
luncheon began by showing especial
solicitude for Bond, Junior, which
Bond, Junior, .was wise enough to
know meant that Bond, senior, was in
wrong. Toward her husband she wore
an air of injured innocence. Some
thing had made her jealous. Bond,
Junior, was sure of that.
In the hall, after dinner, he caught
the son by the coat sleeve.
"1 want to see you in the garage,”
he said.
“Son," began the father, when they
had reached the small automobile
shelter, “I’m in a real predicament and
maybe yon can help me out. You know
yesterday I went around with some of
my clients. Some of them are women
and one of them 1s a blonde, and your
mother knows it. This morning she
found this slipped in the back cush
ion."
Bond, senior, produced from his coat
pocket a single golden wire hair pin.
“That’s what’s the matter with her. if
you can prove an alibi for mo it will
be all right. If you could say, for in
stance, that you had been out with a
blonde on Saturday when we were
away I would give you my blessing ”
Bond, junior, straightened up. A
new feeling of ehumminess for his fa“
ther welled up within him and braced
him for his confession.
■‘Yes.’’ he said, "i'll do it, and, dad,
do you mind giving me that little hair
pin. Just as a token. You know I am
pretty fond of Molly.”

GIVES WARNING OF DANGER
Safety Device That It Is Said Has
Been Tried Out With Satisfac
tory Results.
A device that gives warning and
stops the machinery when any belt or
rope is about to break is now being
used in a number of Idaho mines, says
the Illustrated World. If continued
use proves il to bo satisfactory the de
vice is expected to hud a place as
part of the safety equipment on all
bolt or rope-driven machinery.
The device is able to detect acci
dents before they occur because of the
fact that the breaking cable always
starts first with parts of a worn
strand, and In the case of a belt with
parting of the lacing. The device de
tects the loose strand or lacing by
means of a delicate feeler rod of thin
wire supported from a pivoted bar In
such away that only a narrow space
intervenes between the feeler rod or
wire and the whirring rope or belt
drive. As the strand or lacing unrav
els It hits the feeler wire, and the
wire tilts the delicately balanced bar
upon which it is supported. Tilting
the bar starts the safety mechanism.
This bar has at its end a hook
which normally Is engaged with a
notch In a cam roller, and when the
bar tilts the hook is withdrawn from
the cam roller. The roller is equipped
with a weight suspended from it by a
cord. When the roller is released the
cord unwinds and tho weight drops
into a glass cage, where it is caught
and falls between two metal bands ar
ranged in a V-rclation, but having
their ends spaced a little apart, these
bands are tho terminals of an electric
circuit and tho weight, when it Is
caught, completes tho circuit. A warn
ing boll operated by the electric cir
cuit is rung.
FISHES TREMBLE WITH FEAR
Inhabitants of Water, It Is Asserted,
Show the Same Emotions as
Do Domestic Pets.
To most people whoso opportunities
for observing lish life are limited to
occasional visits to an aquarium, tho
thought rarely occurs that these finny
inhabitants of tho water are capable
of as many varied emotions as are our
domestic pets, tho cat and dog, says
Popular Science.
In an account of the investigations
conducted by Dr. Francis Ward, an
English zoologist, into the behavior
and life of fish in their natural en
vironment. the following appears:
“We are accustomed to think that
only we W'.'.mns become pallid with
fear or agitated with joi’- Dut some
experiments*with perch in the aru|t
cial pond show that when their repose
is suddenly disturbed by tapping on
the glass, the lish visibly tremble and
tho bars which are characteristic of
this species actually disappear for the
time being only to reappear when the
disturbance is removed and the equa
nimity of the fish is restored.
"Sometimes a pike that is rapidly
advancing on his prey becomes suspi
cious about the latter’s character. The
pursuer will suddenly stop, in an at
titude of doubt, his back will arch and
he will remain suspended as though
studying the cause of his suspicions.
Only when he is thoroughly reassured
does he become rigid, to advance to
the final attack; if his suspicion is not
allayed he drops to the bottom of the
pond or swims off in disappointment.”
Laughter.
We talk much about wholesome
food, fresh air, pure air, tho absence
of infection, and oilier hygienic sub
jects. But whoever heard of organ
ized attempts to promote laughter?
Of course such endeavors are not
often needed, but, really, there is hard
ly a tiling that helps so much to pro
mote health as does good, honest,
whole-souled laughter.
Laughter blows away foolish no
tions, sweeps out the blues, shakes up
the dry bones, stirs now life into every
corner of the brain. Laughter fills the
lungs with new air and blows out the
old; opens the eyes to distorted view
points; clears the way for better logic
with now basis; uncovers a multitude
of sins. Laughter is tho friend of tho
world; laughter Is tho only absolutely
human characteristic. I mean, the
laughter of humor and genuine fun.
(It is true that some animals make
faces and noises; that Is about what
some supposedly human folks call
laughter, too.)
Promote laughter; not giggles, nor
smiles, nor sarcastic grins, but laugh
ter—honest, funny, side-splitting, rib
twisting. friend-making laughter. So
shall you be also "friend of the world,
and partner of gods.”—Osteopathic
Magazine.
Right Childhood.
The first character of right child
hood is that it is modest. A well-bred
child does not think it can teach its
parents, or that it knows everything,
it may think its father and motheT
know everything, perhaps that all
grown people know everything; very
certainly it is sure that it does not.
And it is alw’ays asking questions,
and wanting to know more. Well,
that is the first character of a good
and wise wan qt his work- To know
(hat ho knows very little; to perceive
that there are many above him wiser
than he; and to be always asking
questions, wanting to learn, not to
teach, No one ever teaches well who
wants to teach, or governs well who
wants to govern; it is an old saying
(Plato's, but 1 know not if his, first),
and as wise as old.—From “A Crown
of Wild Olives,” by John Ruskln.
| AN INVITATION j
When Liesehen had been with the
Duvarts for one calendar month the
family in full conclave pronounced her
an acquisition. They never ventured
upon a favorable opinion of a cook
within any less period of time, experi
ence having taught them that it was
unsafe.
Yet there were some odd things
about Liesehen that the Duvarts had
remarked. She was rather slow about
following instructions—that is, printed
Instructions. If Mrs. Duvart wanted
a new’ dish prepared and referred iter
to the cookbook for its composition
Liesehen Invariably looked uncomfort
able, and shortly afterward was to bo
seen leaning over the bark fence in
earnest conversation with the German
housemaid next door. The;: she would
come back apparently concealing
something beneath her apron, if the
German housema' ‘ ’ >r was not
attainable, it v is pretty nearly a sure
tiling that I.h'schen would have some
absurd excuse for not having prepared
tlint dish. Also, if she happened to
pet a letter, sh j w" ' ’ 1,1 missing for
tlie next half hour uud site got letters
rather often.
One morning M-s w-—-■ t heard her
ask the postman, "is -lU tor me?” and
the postman anew r, J . "S'-tre” as he
handed iter a letter. She hurried
through to Hie kitchen, and thither
after a few moment - M r Duvart fol
lowed. Just In time to see Liesehen
vanishing through tho h- U gate into
the alley. She was gone for nearly
fifteen minutes, and when site re
turned Mrs. Duvart confronted iter.
“Where have you been, Liesehen?"
she demanded sternly.
"I had to see Katrine by next door
for something vas could not vait," she
replied. "De dishes was washed al
ready, it ml —und I did not t'ink you
vould mind."
“Well," said Mrs. Duvart, "I don't
mind exactly, only I think, Liesehen,
that when you go away you should tell
mo."
“All right," said Liesehen. "I vill
always. Und —und- may I haf tomor
row efening instead! olif T’ursday efe
ning—please?’
Mrs. Duvart said she might and went
away rather puzzled.
Tho evening following Mrs. Duvart
went into the kitchen and found Lie
schen there attired in royal splendor
and Hie hat. but looking nervous and
miserable.
"I thought you were going out?" site
said.
"I —I do not know. I do not t'ink—”
began Liesehen. and then, to Mrs. Du
vart's consternation, burst into a flood
of tears.
Just at that moment the doorbell
rang and Mrs. Duvart hurried away
and opened the door to young Pom
eroy. an occasionally favored suitor of
her daughter, Elizabeth. The young
man was attired in what lie facetious
ly termed his "glad rags," and there
was a carriage at the curb.
"is Miss Elizabeth ready?" ho in
quired, ns soon as he was well inside.
"Heady for what?" asked Mrs. Du
vart. "She’s in the library with that
book you sent her, but she, doesn’t
seem to bo expecting to go out if that's
what you mean.”
Here Miss Elizabeth came up and
greeted Romcroy with an air of sur
prise.
"Well, I like this!” said the young
man, "Here I write to you and tell
you I’ve got seats for Scmbrich and
bog you to honor me with your com
pany and not to trouble to 11. S. V. P.
unless you can’t, and —oh, well, its
rough, but I suppose it’s what I have
to expect.”
"I didn’t get any letter," said Miss
Elizabeth. "When did you write?”
"Night before last. You ought to
have got it in yesterday morning’s
mail.”
"This is mysterious,” said Mrs. Du
vart. "Wait. I’ll go to the kitchen
and ask Liesehen about it. She took
in tho morning mail.”
As Mrs. Duvart approached the
kitchen she heard Lieschen’s voice in
altercation with manly tones, seem
ingly in deprecation. She paused a
moment. Then she heard Liesehen
say: "Yea, you did. You wrote me a
letter und you say, 'I haf seats for
Scmbrich uud I will call mil a car
riage.’ You call me your sweetest
Elizabeth.”
“I never did nothing of the sort.”
said the manly voice. "Somebody’s
been putting up a Job on you.”
Here Mrs, Duvart entered. "Lies
chen,” she said, "if you have that let
ter yon spoke of will you please give
it to me. for I believe it was intended
for Miss Elizabeth.”
Then the explanation came. IJes
chen, it seemed, could not read Eng
lish and had been in the habit of get
ting iter friendly young countrywoman
next door to interpret her cooking rec
ipes and letters.
"Well,” said Miss Elizabeth, when
Mrs. Duvart returned to the parlor and
explained, “there’s only one thing to
do. It's too late for me to dress now,
and I wouldn’t go anyway. Jack, you've
got to take Liesehen.”
“Lieschen’s solid company might ob
ject,” said Mr. Pomeroy. “However,
I’m game to give up the tickets and
carriage if you'll let mo stay here.”
"Splendid!” said Miss Elizabeth,
“Wo'U send them off happy,”
So that is how Liesehen and her
young man went to hear Serobrioh to
style, •
Uncle Eben.
“Patience,” said Uncle Eben, “Is
whut everybody thinks everybody elsq
needs.”
LONG ‘NO-MAN’S LAND’
FALKLAND ISLANDS NOT CON
-BIDERED WORTH POSSESSING.
Though Now a Part of the British
Possessions, This Dates Only
From the Eighteenth Cen
tury—Rivers of Stones.
The Falkland Islands, which will
always be memorable In tho history
of the war, were first discovered by
a Captain Cowley in the days of
Queen Elizabeth, but It was not until
17G4, in the days of King George, that
the British decided to annex them.
it was then found that the French
had established a colony there in the
previous year and had annexed tho
Islands in the name of the king of
France. Tito British, however, later
came into possession, but were evict
ed by tho Spaniards by main force.
A war between England and Spain
was averted, and tho English resumed
possession, only to abandon the place
three years later. Until the transac
tions which took place between the
Argentine and the British governments
in tho early part of the eighteenth
century the islands were a no man's
land.
Lecturing before the Royal Colonial
institute iu London recently. Major
Quayio Dickson, formerly colonial sec
retary for the Falklands, remarked
that tho rivers of stones were con
sidered by many to bo the most in
teresting feature of the Falklands.
They varied in length from a few
yards to two miles, and from a dis
tance looked like rivers.
There was no accepted explanation
of their existence, but one theory put
forward was that the whole country
(including Patagonia) was at one time
covered with ice. When the ice
melted these stones were left bare
and slipped down tho hillsides into
tho valleys where they were now
found. It was also suggested that the
bowlder streams were due simply to
tho natural disintegration of the solid
rock.
Tho blocks were not water worn,
their angles being only a little blunt
ed. They varied in size from one to
two feet In diameter to ten or even
twenty times ns much, and were not
thrown together in irregular piles,
hut spread out Into level sheets or
great streams.
It was not possible to ascertain
their depth, hut the water of small
streamlets could he hoard trickling
through tho stones many feet below
the surface. The actual depth was
probably great, or the crevices be
tween tho fragments must long ago
have been filled up with sand and
peat dust. So largo were the stones
that one could easily find shelter be
neath one of them.
in some eases a continuous stream
of these fragments followed up the
course of a valley, and extended even
to the very crest of the hill. On these
crests huge masses, exceeding In di
mensions any small buildings, stood
as if arrested In their headlong
course.
There also the carved st:sfa of the
archways lay piled on each other like
the ruins of some vast and ancient
cathedral.
War and the Horse.
Farm and Fireside quotes American
horsemen high in authority as saying
that about 500,000 of our horses have
been sold on war orders for about
$100,000,000 since the outbreak of the
war.
Fully 90 per cent of the artillery
horses purchased wore sired by draft
stallions and were out of small mares.
The same horse authorities claim that
the Belgian breed in Europe has been
practically destroyed and Porcheron
brooding stock has also been heavily
sacrificed for war use.
A representative of one of Ameri
ca’s greatest horse importers says it
would not he possible to find 200
draft stallions suitable for export to
America, even were exportation al
lowed.
The crux of the matter clearly indi
cates that American horse users must
depend on the produce of American
studs for draft sires for many years to
come.
Judicial Hearing.
Judge T. J. Moll of the superior
court, room 5, has the reputation of
being accommodating to those attor
neys who have cases pending in his
court. Recently a relative of a loca)
attorney suffered an accident which
made him almost deaf. The attorney
was telling another lawyer of the acci
dent, and in the course of this said a
specialist, who had been consulted,
gave no encouragement of restoring
hearing. After listening to the narra
tive, the second lawyer asked his
friend:
"Why don’t you take it to Judge
Moll? He'll give your relative his
hearing at an early date." —Indianapo-
lis News.
Rats Recovered Liberty.
The official ratcatcher of the British
Western Railroad company died a few
days ago. For over forty years this
man’s family have been tho official
ratcatchers of the company. His meth
od was to take the rats alive when
ever possible. On one occasion he
secured over ninety live rats, which
he imprisoned in a cage. Coming
home in the train he transferred twen
ty of the rats from the cage to a sack.
He then fell asleep, but wa,a aroused
by the rats, which hud eaten a hole
In the sack, running about the com
partment, one being actually up his
sleeve.

“They are very peculiar people next
door,” said the woman witli the ex
pansive society smile. “I am sure that
I have (lone all I could to he neigh
borly evet since they took the house —
let me see—two years ago it is now,
nearly. 1 called on them in the first
place, although 1 really don’t believe
In being too intimate with people Just
because they happen to rent a house
next door to one; but in this case
Mrs. Glenwood spoke to me about
them. She said they were really very
nice people and so 1 culled.
"They are very nice people in some
respects—at least Mrs. Dark is-but
very peculiar, tny dear. As I say, 1
did my best to be nice to them and
when they were in their moving mud
dle I told them it there was anything
that I could do for them to be sure
and let me know. Well, they didn’t
happen to want anything, I suppose,
for they didn’t say so then, but iu less
than three weeks after that Mr. Parks
came to the door and wanted to bor
row my stepladder. You know I al
ways keep my stepladder down in
the basement and it was quite a lot
of trouble 10 go down and get it, but
Mr. Peabody happened to bo at home
and he brought it up and gave il to
Mr. Parks. I don’t mind saying that
1 was annoyed, but I am sure that 1
didn't show it. And, my dear, they
kept that ladder over a day before
they brought it buck and then there
was a speck of whitewash on it that
1 am sure wasn't there when 1 lent il
to them. I'm sure 1 would have no
ticed if there had been. Mr. Peabody
always tells 1110 1 am so particular
about my tilings, but good gracious!
If people didn't take care of things
they never would have things, would
they?
'Then there was the lawn mower. 1
was out mowing the lawn one morn
ing. You know Mr. Peabody isn't home
once a month hardly and I have to
mow it myself or else get a man to
do it and that is so expensive, you
know. And then men are careless
with things. Well, Mr. Parks was
sitting on his front steps and lie vol
unteered to do it for me. 1 need tho
exercise, anyway,' lie said. Rut do you
know, as soon as lie got through with
my lawn lie wheeled the mower across
tile walk and mowed his own, just as
coolly! And as if that wasn't enough,
lie took il on to the Wespers', next
door to him, and mowed theirs. ’.May
as well trim up the neighborhood
v,title we are about it,' lie said, laugh
ing as if it was a good joke. Of course
the lawns aren't large, but just think!
"And then 1 recommended a laun
dress to them and went iu to give
them her address, and one time when
they were out 1 let the express peo
ple leave u package for them and look
it in to them myself. 1 assured them
that it wasn't any trouble —and il real
ly wasn't so very much, you know —
only it might occur too often.
"Rut it was about the telephone I
was going to tell you. They didn't
have a telephone put iu. Mr. Parks
said lie didn’t care to have one until
lie made up his mind whether lie
wanted to take the house for a year,
and I told them, of course, that they
were very welcome to use mine at any
time. They said it was very kind of
me, and so il was. 1 think, but 1 didn t
think they would be making a public
convenience of my bouse. They came
in—oh, several times. They always
apologized, but that didn t make it
any more convenient for me to be an
swering the door and letting them in
and letting them out again. Once or
twice I was clear up to tho top of the
house and had to go clear downstairs.
1 was always just as pleasant as could
be, but 1 think they understood that
i didn't care much about it, and they
stopped coming until Airs. Parks' ill
ness and then Mr. Parks began com
ing again—to call tho doctor. It
seemed to me, though, that he needn't
have always left it until it became an
emergency. Of course in a case of
sickness I wouldn't think of refusing
anybody and I like to be neighborly.
Rut aren't people peculiar sometimes?
“Well, thank goodness, they had
about stopped bothering me until last
week, when there came a ring at the
phone and somebody said; ‘is this
Mrs. Peabody?' I said ’Yes,’ and then
the, woman —it was a woman —said:
I'm very sorry to trouble you, but
could you get Mrs. or Mr. Parks to
the phone? it's something very im
portant.'
"I thought that was about the limit.
I said: ‘No, I don't see how I can. I’m
very busy and I would have to dress
and—no, I'm sorry, but I can’t do it,’
“ Oh, very well; excuse mo for trou
bling you,’ she said Iu a sarcastic
voice and the receiver was shut off.
“Now, would you believe it? After
all Hie pains I’ve been to to be nice
to them those people are just as cool
as can be since then. I suppose (hoy
are offended, but I don’t know what
they could have expected me to do.”

MAKING MONEY WITH NEEDLE
Various Ways in Which Woman Who
Is Proficient Can Earn at Least
Part of Her Living.
The woman who is handy with a
needle need not lack employment, and
If she is clever in catching artistic
ideas she can make so much more
money in a pleasant occupation. There
Is much work to bo done aside from
regular dressmaking, millinery and
knitting.
For instance, the vocation of dress
making is as old as the beach sands,
but many odd time occupations which
are distinctly new have evolved them
selves from the seamstress’ tasks.
There is a woman in one town who
works buttonholes. For many reasons
she could not do regular dressmaking,
but she takes in many a penny in the
course of a year. People who do their
own sewing but dislike the buttonhol
ing bring the garments to her for this
finishing, and oven the village dress
maker often sends in a bundle of va
rious garments to bo “buttonholed” lu
a time of rush.
From the easy buttonholes in lin
gerie blouses at one cent each her
prices range to two cents each in
woolen dresses and motor coats and to
five and sometimes tea cents a hole
in corduroy, fur and heavy cloth coats.
She charges according to material and
the time and skill required. She does
no other kind of sewipg. She has,
found it profitable to buy by the dozen
buttonhole twist and thread of the
right size in a variety of standard
colors, the price of which is included
in her charges. Buying by the dozen
she gets the material cheaper.
Another woman makes skating and
motor caps and bonnets.
LOST MONEY BY DEFECTION
Baron Nordenskjold, Tempted by Of
fered Honor, Made Mistake When
He Accepted It.
When the late Baron Nordeuskjold
was at Ceylon on the way home from
his journey along the northern coast
of Siberia he received a telegram
from the Russian government asking
him whether he would accept from
tile czar a certain decoration as an
appreciation of his services to Russia,
For many days the famous explorer
wavered, as he was a member of
Bjornson's Antidecoration club, whose
members were solemnly pledged never
to accept any decoration from any
body.
Nordenskjoki, however, could not re
sist the temptation, so he replied to
the telegram in the affirmative. It la
not hard to imagine his disappoint
ment when upon reaching home a
friend ot his, a high official, told him,
the following:
“The Russian government was well
aware of your antagonistic views In
regard to decorations and had there
fore placed in readiness 300,000 rubles
to be paid you in the event of your
refusing to accept the insignia, but be
fore paying that sum they wanted to
try your firmness. Russia is certainly
grateful to you for your failure to live
up to jour pledge.”
Pangs of Poverty.
The eldest daughter had returned
from a finishing school and was over
at the hot to of some neighbors where
she once delighted to slide down the
cellar doer and play “1 spy." But
now she v as on a more dignified mis

eager listeners as she gave vividly her
Impressions of the year away from
homo, remarks the Indianapolis News.
The motln r of the flock was particu
larly interested in view ot decisions
soon to be made in regard to schools
for her own daughters.
After a lew minutes of enthusiastic
recital the visitor paused and her
countenance, changing, said with a
sigh, “O, dear, but it’s awful to be
poor."
“Why,” said another neighbor, “that
is a strange remark after all the fine
times you have been telling us about.
What is all the trouble, my dear?”
‘‘Well." va the reply, “It's Just this
way. You see 1 must have a dog be
fore I go hack to school, and father
agreed to ibis all right, but says I
simply can t spend more than SIOO
for one. I know I can t get a dog that
the other girls will look at for that
plnchy sum.”
Feathered Music Box.
For that dainty household pot, the
canary, wo have been largely indebted
to Germany, and the sweet tones of
this wonderful “music box” have in
many cases been the result of long
and tedious hours of patient teaching
by some German peasant. The little
feathered suidents are capable of at
taining quite a degree of skill in imi
tating tones. Tire German canary is
known under throe or more different
names, given to denote the degree of
training. 1b this country the Harts
Mountain canary is best known, partly
because of its being less expensive
than some of the others, and partly on
account of its accomplishments as a.
songster,
Effect of Polishing.
Take a piece of cheesecloth, wrung
out in cold w'ator, and clean the sur
face thoroughly. Then put a few
drops of crude oil on a second piece
of cheesecloth wrung out in cold wa
ter and begin to polish, turning the
cloth in rubbing in order to distribute
tho oil and prevent the wood from be
coming oily. Always rub with the
grain. This gives a lasting polish in
stead of the more brilliant polish giv
en by cheaper polishes.
