An American View.
An,Importaut Movement.
Four ot the great railroad brother'
hoods the Brotherhood of Locomo
tive Engineers, the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen,
the Order of Railway Conductors and
the Brotherhood of Railroad Train
men, with an aggregate membership
of about 325,000, are at present taking
a referendum vote on the question of
submitting demands for an eight-hour
basio workday in railroad freight train
Bervlce. This movement Is in every
. respect the most important In the his
tory of organized labor iu this conn
try. It is fraught with greater pos
sibilities than any other movement
Undertaken by labor. While every
fmrrt.ocnt that hag for Its cuibct lb
reduction of houri of labor, or the
advance of wages, has its social as
pects, they are many, times hardly
tiiacernib'e except to those directly
interested. The machinist, the brick
layer or the printer may secure a' re
duction In working hours, or In
creased pay,and the cost is readily and
easily shifted to ttio shoulders of the
consumer. The change hardly la perceptible-.
Neither are tho methods
used to bring about the changed con
ditions of great publio concorn. , A
strike takes place, and if It arouses
any Interest at all, it is' purely local.
The average mon will say, "I don't
know much about it, but. I believe
those fellows should have shorter
hours, or higher wages," and he dis
misses the 'subject. The demand for
an eight-hour day in railroad train
service is a very different proposition.
The cost cannot readily be shifted
vith the Interstate Commerce Com
mission regulating rates. "The econ
omic aspects of a railroad -strike of
suoh vast proportions are almost be
yond comprehension. The railroads
are to the life of the country what the
blood arteries are to the human body.
If they become clogged there is im
mediate noed for a physician,
a Ktrike would in reality be an
trial revolution.

j uur, touuw-utune ;WUU wuio uuiu
in Germany are both angered and sur
prised that the average native Ameri
can is against Germany in the world
war now going on.
I The object of this is to make clear
the attitude of the American people
toward the German as an individual
and their attitude toward his Govern
ment. - To be entirely frank, I believe that
while our people regard the German
immigrant as one of the best assets of
the United States, over 90 per cent of
tbem are anxious to see Germany de
feated in the present war.
In the minds of most men two Ger
manys exist side by side.
One is the Germany idealized by
Carlyle, the Germany of Goethe and
Schiller, the Germany of BCience, art
and literature, the Germany that has
become the schoolmaster of the whole
world in economics and efficiency, and
which has taught mankind to make
the forces of nature perfect servants
of the human will. , .
The other is the Germany of auto
cracy, where one man rules the others
by the divine appointment of Al
mighty God. The Germany where
the peasants and mechanio are work
oxen in time of peace and cannon
fodder in time of war, the Germany
that has littered the earth with Bpies;
that regards all ftations as future
enemies and prepares for their subju
gation; that in time of profound peace
marks for spoliation men of wealth
in neighboring nations; that treats
its treaties as 'scraps of paper' when
it becomes its interest to violate them;
the Germany where the military power
is above, the civil; that makes
TreitBChke an oracle, and brandishes
the mailed fist.
. For the first, Americans have the
prof oundest ad miration the deepes t
sympathy.
, For the second they entertain utter
detestation the strongest loathing.
The Germany of, the Kaiser has
compelled the natioas of the earth to
buckle on their armor, and gird their
swords to their Bides.
Germany has, soDght to make them
fear her and has suoceeded to ber own
undoing. Her military system has
become a menace to the civilized
world; therefore the nations draw to
gether as the hard of buffalo does when
the tiger oomes near.
Germany wants a larger place in the
sun more of the earth's surface, no
mutter whose property she appropri
ates. Keep in mind that the whole
German nation has been organized
tor war, railroads have been built
primarily for the business ot war
secondarily for trafllc, and so it has
been with every factory and laboratory
throughout the Empire. The trutb
is the ideals of the German Govern
ment are those of the Middle Ages.
Such a government cannot exist by
the side of free institutions.
If Germany wins the rule, of the
people will disappear In Enrcpe. If
the Allies win the military caste will
disappear in Germany. When the
German people really rule Germany,
when its government becomes an in
strum ent in the bands of its people
which they may nee at will; when it
exists tor the people, and not the
people for the Government, then the
affairs of Germany will cease to be
an object of concern to its neighbors.
Many ot our German fellow-citizens
wonder why we have "no animosity
toward England. The reason is plain:
Wherever the English flag has floated
self-government has taken root and
flourished. Men are as free in Canada as
they are iu the United States. Austra
lia, New Zealand and South Africa are
practically self-governing countries.
Germany expected help from Ire
land and South Africa, but she was
mistaken. They each' possessed a
greater amount of political freedom
as a part of the British Empire than
they could hope for as Provinces of
the German Empire. ;
The average American holds Ger
many responsible for the present
agitation for preparedness.
He is for preparedness against prob
able energies, but he cannot . tell
how much of the present agitation
is false alarm and how much of
solid foundation there is for it. He
has been around at election time for a
good many years and knows a dollar
when he Bees it coming up the road,
and he knows that dollar is hunting
other dollars. He don't want to em
barrass the administration, but he
wants to know.
If Germany wins, it means, in all
probability, a continuation of the
present autocracy and ultimate war,
for which we must get ready and
thoroughly ready. . If Germany loBes
or the autocracy is over-thrown we
need not bother about military mat
ters. If we have to prepare for war
we don't want it to result in a military
caste and we are not going to permit
it-
Back of all this there is an uneasi
ness in the mind of every thinking
man as to what will be the effect of
this war on mankind. It will not leave
the world as it found it. Europe will
go into the hands of a receiver. The
nations will either repudiate their
debts flatly, cease pnying interest and
devote their energies to discharging
the principal or organize their industries-
bo as t'o absorb ttib profits
which now go to individuals. All
money standards may be remodeled.
How will this affect the United
State? No ene knows.
In any event, the soldier of industry
looms up who must be organized into
a great industrial army because the
State must have bis services as a
working man in time of peace just as
it must have his services as a soldie
in time of war in order that the obliga
tions of the war may be met. These
things are not pleasant to contemplate,
but we must begin to think about
them.
Just another word to
neighbors and frieuds.
was not written for the
man in the United States, but to the
German who lives next door. We
know how you feel about friends and
relatives back in the old country, but
is it not a fact that you came to this
country to escape oppression, to get
from under the hand of the military
autocracy? We welcomed you with
open arms because of your lessons of
thrift, economy and system that we
needed. You made two grains of
wheat grow wliere one grew before
The rocks and rubbish disappear from
your acres and crops appear at harvest
time. Your children intermarry with
our children, and the result is a
strong, sturdy, clean, upstanding
generation.
You are good neighbors and ex
cellent friends, but we want you to be
Americans first.
To state my own views frankly I
don't think the United States has been
entirely neutral in this war. I believe
that Germany's warning to citizens of
the United States to keep off English
ships should have been heeded, be
cause an" English ship is a bit of
English territory afloat, subject to
English law, and when a citizen of
the United States goes aboard of one
of these ships he must take his chances
the ame as if he enters a
town.
I know there is a treaty with Prussia
100 years old covering this matter,
but that treaty did not take into con
eideration modern conditions of war
fare. I believe tbe loan of $500,000,000
to tbe Allies is in the nature of a
guaranty on onr part that they shall
win tbe war, For if Germany wins
this money will be lost, It is another
cord binding us to the Allies. But
these things are , backed by publio
sentiment because of the belief that
If Berlin dominates Paris and London
we will have to fight to maintain our
own form of government.
If German voters should unite
against Wilson It would insure his re
election. Will our German fellow
citizens ask themselves why?
Every German I have talked to ex
pects this war to result in larger
. liberty for the German people when
j they win the war. I wish I oould
think so, but I don't. If they lose,
the military machine that has scared
our German

Ironton Testimony Remains
Unshaken.
Time is the best test of truth. Here
is an Ironton story that haB stood the
test of time. It is a story with a point
which will ccyne straight home to
many of us.
Anderson Rust, painter, Ironton,
says: "I was badly in need of some
thing to relieve me of lameness in my
back. My kidneys were frequently
too active, especially at night and
sometimes the passages of the kidney
secretions were accompanied by pain.
Short use of Doan's Kidney Pills, pro
cured at the Arcadia Valley Drug
Co., cured me."
A LASTING CURE.
Over three years. later, Mr. Rust
said: "I haven't had any return of
of kidney complaint since Doan's
Kidney Pills cured me." .
