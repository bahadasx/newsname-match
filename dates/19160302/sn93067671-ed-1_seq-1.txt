Our Weekly Let
ter From Oolenoy
n the year 1863, in the city of
Charleston, S. C., Capt. Wm. M.
Jones, of the Peters' Creek sec
tion, purchased a small meat
chopper or "sausage grinder"
as it was commonly called., He
paid the sum of $6 for it. In
company with hin and actinz
as "reserves" in the Confederate
army Were Messrs. Reese Bowen
and Bennett Jones, his brother.
The purchase, the first of its
kind In - that section, created
much interest. It was not un
-common for Capt. Jones to kill
from 40 to 50 hogs yearly-but
the work of the little grinder
did not end with this. Into
dany, many homes it was bor
rowed-its owner was an accom
modating neighbor. After his
death some 12 years ago, this
useful article fell into the hands
of his daughter. Mrs. A. K.
Edens-and our story does not
end here-it is still grinding
meat, and still fastened to the
little four-legged bench and is in
good condition.
Mr. and Mrs. Grover Keith

Ing A vivid account of sone
happenbin -in the Europrat

At the ,' town in Germany
where I was staying everything
w~s turmol and confusion. All
strangers were regarded with
suspicion if not with open .con
tenipt. One day while wander
ing about the -town I came to a
large building that had been in
construction when the war broke
out. The laborers had all gone
away to the army and left the
structure half finished with its
massive top insecurely support
ed upon uncertain timbers. Its
peculiar style of architecture at- A
itracted my attention and I went
inside to examine it closer. By
accident I chanced to move an
important timber. Its falling
dislodged another and this in
turn brought down another un
til I was compelled to run for
my life to vet out of the falline
building.. I had barely cleared
the door when the whole struc
ture came tumbling down, a
pile of rai.
. Although this was entirely ac
cidental, it dave the Germans a
pretext for seizing me and sub.
,mitting me to some'very rough
treatment. The mistreating of
me,an American citizen,brought
about an international contro
versy that resulted in the United
States becoriIng engaged in the
war.
1 One day a frind came to me
and told me that a large body of
American soldiers had landed at
a seaport nearby and were
imarching to 1ny rescue. The
*Germans fled before ."Uncle
Sam's boys", and I was soon in
the hands of friends again.
. While I was thanking my de
liverers one of them called me
aside and advised me to make a
hasty toilet; and dress myself in

But wvhy should I go further

be added to a man's happiness?
