LONDON". .March z.?After a
lull in infantry operations in the
vicinity of Verdun since the early
part of the week there has been
a resumption of the Herman offensive
in the Woevre region. A
violent bombardment was followed
by a spirited attack on
the French at i-resnes, ten miles
southeast of Verdun. Paris rc- j
ports the driving out of the Ger-1
mans from the few positions;
which they succeeded in pene- j
tratine: in their assault.
. I
The new attack gives color to j
what seems to be the prevailing'
military opinion in Paris that tliei
< ierman offensive at Verdun had j
merely halted. It also calls particular
attention to the Woevre
region, where the Teutons have
advanced along a line south, of
Port Douaumont well to the base
of the Meuse heights as far as!
Combres, twelve miles southeast j
of Verdun. j
Difficulties in Advance.
| Dispatches from both Berlin and j
Tans point to the difficulties of a further
advance in this region. The
French positions, Paris points out,
stretch along the heights, from which j
the ground drops abruptly to the'
Woevre plain, with its moist clay soil, j
across which the transport of the
heaviest of the German artillery, on j
ground away from the high roads, is !
held to be almost impossible, while at- j
tacking troops would have to deploy in j
the open under the fire of the French j
guns on the heights.
Berlin commentators, however, ad- i
vance the view that the Teutons have '
previously shown that similar disad
vantageous conditions could be sue- |
cessfully met, the storming of the!
heights just to the south by the Ger- j
mans in 1914, when St. Mihiel was cap- I
: ;red, being pointed to in this connec- ,
tlor. j
From Dutch sources come reports j
that the German drive is to be resumed I
from the northeast, 90,000 men having)
been concentrated near Buzy, behind!
Fort Vaux. which is said to have been
destroyed by the German heavy mor- j
tars. * |
German Losses Reported Huge. j
Estimates of the German losses in!
the offensive are running high in en- ;
te5,?quarters, one from Paris placing '
them at between 1-5.000 and 150.000.
one-third of the German effectives. All
accounts from German sources, however-.
have declared that the casualties
i'f 'he attacking armies were surprisingly
small.
The exact figures of the French
Jesses at Verdun have been given to
tie committee of military affairs of
the chamber of deputies by Col. BoucaI
eille. chief secretary to Gen. Gallienl.
minister of war. It is stated that they
were not high.
Larger Operations Expected.
Tf is believed Iri many quarters that
the attack on Verdun was only a preliminary
to operations on a much larger
scale for the purpose of trying to
crush the French once and for all.
ifowever uiat may be, it is affirmed !
t r.at Gen J off re is fully prepared for!
all eventualities. So far only the local t
French reserves have been called upon j
*t Verdun, the great general reserve
forces remaining intact for use in re- I
pelling other heavy onslaughts or for
carrying out a great counter attack j
v hen tim opportune moment comes.
The question is raised as to whether J
the next German attack will again be j
at Verdun or along the front from the I
iM.rnnie r?> the Aisne. as it is known I
that the Germans have been making!
preps rations along the latter lines, the!
southern limit <>f which is many miles
nearer to Paris than s Verdun,
j These preparations, however, are not
i?o elaborate ?* those which had been
made f<?r Verdun, and slu^uld the Germans
attempt the latter pi ah the military j
observers say they wpuld be liable to a

by a Large Majority After
Sharp Debate.
? . j
Representative Morrison of j
ndiana. one oi the great orators j
if the House, today forced a)
how-down on the congressional j
riileage row, and in one of the
est speeches heard on the sub-!
set of shams and pretense in.
natty a long day put a quick fin-h
to the annual farce wherein
Ileged economists endeavor to
tit the mileage allowance for
ungressmen front 20 cents a mile
j 5 cents, or actual expenses, or
othing at all.
Representative Morrison has
tade two speeches in his eight
ears in Congress. Today's efjrt
was his second. His first
peech was cjn the subject of
lileage bluffs and shams about a i
ear afro and todav he reminded'
he House that the men whoj
lade the most noise against mile- j
ge on the House floor were al-'
rays the tirst ones at the win-'
ow when the mileage checks
/ere being distributed. His "
peech was a pure calling of
luffs, and he succeeded remarkblv
well, amid the cheers of a
ery crowded attendance of memers.
The speech was made within an hour j
rter the legislative, executive and juicial
appropriation bill was taken up
>r discussion, under tlie five-minute
lie. Representative Borland, author
f the provision for making clerks
ork an extra, hour without compenLtion,
had a prominent s?at in the
ouse, but his provision will not be
>ached for several days.' The mileage
uestion remains exactly where it has j ,
i?en for years, as the House sustained
le mileage of senators at the twenty- '
;nt rate and for representatives at j
le same figure.
Mr. Cox Renews Attack. <
As soon as the bill was taken up
epresentative Cox of Indiana introiiced
his annual fireworks on the milepe
subject In effect he reoffered his j f
mendment of several years past pro- *
iding for actual expenses instead of I (
i cents a inne. ne men loucnea on ;
ie Borland rider, saving the only!1
rounds of defense for the "added J
our" provision i4> economy, and ar- 1
ued that the country never needed 1
conomy more than now. He hitched
lileage and the time of clerks to- ?
ether, and argued that mileage should 1
e reduced and clerks should be made >
work longer without added pay.
hairman Byrns said he had alwa>s c
een in favor of mileage reduction, and j
aid that the Senate had always mark- f
rj the mileage up to L'O cents after the \
louse, in violent discussion, had cut it
own. For that reason, said chairman
yrrts. it seemed useless to endeavor to
lake a reduction in the House. ]
chairman Byrns said he had introuced
a mileage reduction bill, which
ad been referred to the committee on '
lileage.
Representative Howard of (ieorgia of?red
a substitute amendment to strike
ul the entire mileage allowance for senUii
m 14 11rI rpnrpspnl m 11 VPS He rininforl i
is finder at many members and chargJ
them with demagoguery.
Questions Members' Sincerity.
"They voted to reduce mileage," he
nid, "and at the same time they prayd
to Cod that the Senate would
estore it." Me said the members
re either entitled to 20 cents a mile
r nothing. He said there is no rea?n
why taxpayers should pay the way
f congressmen.
Either eliminate these or have the
outage to vote for the proper allownce
to bring your wives and children
ere. for the man who does not bring
is family here sometimes is critlised."
Representative Sisson of Mississippi,
member of the subcommittee in
barge of the bill, reminded the House
hat the principle of mileage was based
n the fact that the First Congress '
eterinined that every man should reeive
equal pay, and that none should
e penalized because of living a long
istance from the capital.
Representative Barnhart of Indiana
hrew cold water on the five cents a 3
lile idea, but advocated a basis of t
ctual expenses. ,
Representative Cox seemed to be netled
at Representative Howard's sug- (
estion that some House members 1
wing onto the Senate coattails in the j
one that the upper body would re
tore the twenty-cent-a-mile basis. He
aid that Mr. Howard seemed to be a
lind reader.
Representative Howard said in reply
le had seen men vote for increase in
uileage on a rising vote, where no recrd
is kept, and that those same men
ad voted against twenty-cent mileage
then a yea and nay vote was called.
Representative Dupre of Louisiana
rose and quoted the old hymn
While the light holds out t6 burn
The vilest sinner may return."
Challenges His Colleagues.
Up jumped Representative Morrison
f Indiana, who made* a startling
peech a year ago. calling bluffs right
nd left. He told the House that if
lembers meant it they should defeat
he whole bill rather than accept 20
ents a mile. Otherwise, he said, the
thole thing is a mockery.
"There are not ten men here who
iclieve we are being paid too much,"
e said, "but if they are in earnest let
hem strike down the salaries. Peraps
the people back home will then
elieve they are not - worth* -more,

! SENATE CLEARS TRACK
FOR VOTE ON WARNING
Senator Stone at the opening: of the
Senate session today proposed an adjournment
to take the Senate out of
recess, in which it has been working,
so as to clear the parliamentary situation
for a vote 011 a resolution of
warning against travel on armed ships.
| Senator Stone made the suggestion
after a conference with administration
leaders, who decided the situation in
the House was so complex, with possibility
of delay, that they would not
wait for a vote there, but would go
ahead in the Senate, where they are
confident the anti-administration resolutions
can be defeated.
Senator James, one of the administration
supporters, said:
"it has been decided to bring the.
resolution up for action as soon as possible,
but probably not today. We
have got the votes in the Senate to
Stone Outlines Position.
Senator Stone from the floor announced
that he and President Wilson
were not in accord on the issue.
"I desire to state the international
situatiqn as 1 understand it." said Senator
Stone.
"A sharp issue has been defined between
Germany and Great Britain as
to the status of armed merchantmen.
Germany contends that armed merchant
vessels are the equivalent of
auxiliary war vessels, and has announced
lier policy to l?e that, after
March 1. armed merchantmen would be
regarded as warships ami subject to
the rules of war.
"On the other hand, Great Britain contends
that under international law
merchantmen have the right to be armed
for defensive purposes and that
armed merchantmen are entitled under
the law to the same immunity as unarmed
ships, without regard to cargo.
