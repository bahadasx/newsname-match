Row H. Miller moved into J.
II. Srolti's pmpertj last Wed
nesday.
Rev. Dunlop and wife, cvan.
Pi lists, closing tht-ir revival ef-
forts here, left last Thursday
rr.orr.ing for booster, 0., where
they will sojourn for a short time,
crscious they did a great work
here. .
C. J. Miller, wife and children,
visited D. Mori's family at Plea
sant Hill yesterday.
Mrs. M. J. Coburn and Mrs.
Dill returned home last Friday
from their visit with John Moore's
family at Pikeville.
The sacrament bf the Lord's
Supper was celebrated yesterday
at our Presbyterian church.
The attendance at our M. E.
Sunday school yesterday was 100
and collect'on $3.20.
It seems that February is giv
ing us a frigid farewell. When
March comes we may expect some
cheerful weather and happy
songs of birds.
A new man will hereafter sup
ply this place with meat. Change
seems to;be the spice of life.
Last week seemed to be tobac
co week here, and many car loads
of the weed were chipped from
this place.
A great many changes from
...residence to residence, and froni
farm to farm, take place about
this time of year.
Dr. J. Vanlue moved his fami
ly into his newly acquired home
recently bought of ,the heirs of
Jacob Peiffer, and is now busy
erecting an office for his business.
Preaching at the usual morn
ing hour at our M. E. church on
next Sunday.
A Christian Endeavor has been i
organized in our Presbyterian
church, to meet every Sunday
evening at 6 o'clock. May the
young people of that church find
it a good place to cultivate their
gifts and improve their Christian
graces.
Our township trustees met here
today in regular session to tran
sact routine business. It seems
a vacancy in the board of trus
tees is about to occur by removal
"from the township, on account of
which it will be incumbent on the
oldest Justice of the township to
fill the vacancy for the unexpired
term.
The D. Moul Lumber Compa
ny's stock of lumber, hardware,
paints, etc., was invoiced last
week and delivered to the pur
chaser in the sum of about $15,
000. . New nea will run that in
stitution hereafter. It seems
that much of oar business is go
ing into the hands of new men.
Indications are now that our
carpenters will be our busiest
people this season. ; Our contrac
tor3 are getting in all the time
the weather will permit on build
ings and betterments, and now
have work engaged that will em
ploy their entire force until har
vest pr longer.

Admiral Fiske on Naval
Defense.
The essential requirement of
any defense is that it shall be ad
equate; because an inadequate
defense will be broken down.
while the attack will retain a
large proportion of its original
strength In the United States
Naval Institute, in 1905, the pre
sent writer showed, by means of
a series of tables, how Tvhen two
forces fight, the force which is
originally the more powerful will
become gradually more powerf u',
relatively to the Weaker, as the
fight goes on. That, for instance,
if two forces start with the rela
tive powers of 10 to 8, the weak
er force will be reduced so much
more rapidly, than the stronger
that when it has been reduced to
zero the stronger force will have
a value of 5.69. The values men
tioned indicated the actual fight
ing strength strength made up
of all the factors material, phy
sical, and psychic that constitu
ted it. Of course, none of these
factors can ever be accurately
compared; but nevertheless the
tables seemed to prove that in a
contest between two forces whose
total strengths are as 10 to 8 one
force will be reduced to zero,
while the other will be reduced
not quite one-half.
Inasmuch as the psychic ele
ment in defense is the strongest
single element, it is apparent that
if the decision is reached to pre
pare an effectual defense the na
tion must be absolutely united,
and must appreciate at its fall
value the debilitating influence
of opposition to the measure; for,
no matter how much money a
nation may expend, no matter
how many lives it may sacrifice,
its defense cannot ha ire an effi
ciency proportional to the effort
if a considerable number of its
citizens are permitted to oppose it
In our own country there havt
been so much talking and writing
recently about defense, that there
is danger of the question coming
to be considered academic; though
no question is more practical, no
question is more urgent.
Defense must defend. Rear-
Admiral Bradley A. Fiske in The
North American Review.
War Upon Pain!
Pain is a visitor to every home
and usually it come3 quite unex
pectedly. But you are prepared
for every emergency if you keep
a small bottle of Sloan's Liniment
handy. It is the greatest pain
killer ever discovered. Simply
laid on the skin no rubbing re
quiredit drives the pain away.
It is really wonderful.
Mervin H. Soister, Berkeley,
Cal. writes: "Last Saturday, af
ter tramping around the Panama
Exposition with wet feet, I came
home with my neck so stiff that
I couldn't turn. I applied Sloan's
Liniment freely and went to bed.
To my surprise, next morning the
stiffness had almost disappeared,
four hours after the second ap
plication I was as good as new."

A Mint of Money.
The former director of the Un
ited States mint fn Philadelphia.
Mr. Landis, resigned after sery-
ing for twelve years. In com
menting on the fabulous wealth'
that has passed through his hand:
1
Mr. Landis states that it consibt-f
ed of $11,000,000 in cents, $19,
000.000 in nickels, $65,500,000 in
silver dollars, halves, quarters'
and dimes, and $372,000,000 in
gold. The entire coinage totals
$462,500,000. To give one abet-3
ter idea of the quantity of this
bulk, Mr. Landi3 said it would(
tax the capacity of 683 cars of J
twelve tons each. It would be
impossible to haul this vast "sum'
with fewer than eleven locomo
tives, which would mean thaJ
each would have to pull about
sixtythree cars. These cars in
one train would extend about ten
mnes. 1 here was exactly $4io,-.
000,000 in coin and gold bullion j
in the mint when Mr. Landis
i
turned it over to his successor, j
The largest amount at the mint
at any one time in the last twelve
years was $452,000.000. Phila
