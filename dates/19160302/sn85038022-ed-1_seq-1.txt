THE HOME DP QUALITY CLOTHES
If there ever was a time for serious contemplation about clothes needs that
moment has arrived. If, next winter, you are asked to pay advances on clothes that
will strjke you as steep, don't blame any retailer. Woolens have soared to unprec
edented heights; you know something about the wool situation yourself, by the way
it is selling here; dyestuffs are alarmingly scarce; trimmings have gone 'way up;
even labor is better paid than ever before.
You Can't Dodge These Things
They Are Facts!
But here is something you can do, and that is to get an extra suit NOW
while we are selling Society Brand, Stein-Bloch, R. B. Fashion, Hirsh-Wickwire,
