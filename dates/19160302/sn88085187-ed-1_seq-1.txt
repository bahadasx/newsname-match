PEANUTS
The peanuts are ready for the roasting!
We refer to the peanuts in congress —the little
men who are plotting against the president and
America's sea policy in the hour of national
danger and suspense —the exceedingly cheap
little peanut men who make up the hulk of our
national legislature.
Peanut men for example like our own Wesley
Lorimer Jones. A special dispatch from Wash
ington to The Times today quotes him as saving
that he will prevent the immediate consideration
by the senate of a resolution supporting tbe
president by invoking the ancient "unanimous
consent" technicality.
By so doing Jones hopes to embarrass Wilson,
much, of course, to the glory of the G. O. P.
The times are too dangerous for the people <>f
this country to put any further confidence, any
trust whatsoever in the blundering, politicking,
plotting "statesmen" such as he who have en
tered into a gigantic conspiracy in Washington
to sell their country's honor for the mean ad
vantage of ward politics.
Head and front of this conspiracy are many
democratic members from the south, best known
as cotton statesmen.
The south today is full of speculators and
money sharks who have bought up large quanti
ties of the last cotton crop at low price and hope
to sell their holdings to Germany at 300 to 400
per cent profit.
They want Wilson to end the quarrel with
Germany and begin a quarrel with the allies,
which shall be serious enough to compel the lift
ing of-the blockade just a little —just enough to
let in cotton at triple the price they paid for it.
For the sake of the fortunes of such as these, the cotton
congressmen have dragged the democratic party in Washing
ton into conspiracy to fling the fortunes and the honor of their
country into the garbage can.
THERE'S MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN IT!
Into this conspiracy have been joined the piffling, blunder
ing, provincial fellows like Jones and Humphrey who play to
little groups at home, and grafting congressmen, congressmen
who have political and personal grudges against the president
—all the base elements which always work for self interest
ami to the wnids with the country's advantage.
CONGRESS DUE
FOR SHOWDOWN
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 2.
—After debating an hour and 40
minutes, the senate failed to re
port on the armed merchantmen
issue today.
The conflict between President
Wilson and congress broke when
Senator Stone interrupted the dis
cussion of the Shields water pow
er bill and made a statement
about the Gore resolution warn
ing Americans from taking pass
age on armed vessels.
Senator Lodge, republican,
agreed that the question should
come to a vote immediately. He
declared President Wilson sorely
needed the aid of all the senators
regardless of party.
Stone admitted that he and the
president did not agree on the
question.
"The president Is disposed to
support the contention that mer
chantmen have a right to arm for
defensive purposes," said Stone.
"He doesn't say what his defense
is, and I don't know, if merchant
men are submarined and Ameri
cans suffer, I will hold tbe gov
ernment to a strict acountabllity.

It is declared that it is essen

for him to reach a satisfactory so
