Tuesday morning the barn of
Page McMahah at Rich Hill was
entirely destroyed by fire says
the Rich Hill Review.
r The barn was a large frame
structure and .burned so- rapidly
that by the time the fire depart
ment' reached the scene 'the roof
was tumbling in. " The barn was
valued frW $800 to $1,000, to
gether with its contents of stock
and a small amount of hay and
grain. The barn was insured for
$550.'
s.A pathetic feature of the fire
was the .burning of live stock, ,4
head of horses : and 2 head of
mules. The stock was owned by
Lee Smith, who had rented the
barn, and kept stock and harness
in the building and which - were
lost. Mr. Smith's loss is estimat
ed at $1,000 with no insurance.
He jif.a working, deserving
manan hia loss is deeply regret-,

the barn a&the . the also ' sus

is also regretted. fThe animal was
valued atlOO. There were a
number of citizens at the scene of
the fire, but could render little
assistance, the barn burning so
rapidly on account of the inflatn
mable material. ... .. -

For Presidential Elector.
The many friends of W. W
Ferguson in the Sixth . Congres
sional District of Missouri are
strongly urging his selection as
Presidential Elector on the Demo
cratic national ticket this coming
November.
Mr. Ferguson, who is well
known throughout the state as one
of the most influential Demo
crats in Southwest Missouri, is a
gentleman of education and .- pol
ish, as well as a man of large ex
perience in business affairs. He
has been president of the Farm
ers & Manufacturers Bank of Rich
Hill, his homer town, for more
than 35 years, and has been iden
tified with some of the most im
portant financial - enterprises of
this section of the state.
Mr. Ferguson has always been
active in the" affairs of the Demo
cratic party, giving freely of his
means and time to further the
party's success, and has never be
fore a&ked for political prefer
ment of any kind. He is a pleas
ing and convincing public speaker
and his selection as Presidential
Elector from this congressional
district would be a most grateful
recognition of his service, as well
as a compliment to the Democracy
