WASHINGTON, March 2. A real
sensation wa3 sprung In the senate
today when Senator Gore made the
following declaratien:

formation, if not a declaration, that
that such a war might be ovll to
America, but that America, entering
the war now, might be able to end
It by Bummer, thereby rendering a
great service to civilization."
Senator Stone denied this. The
White House this afternoon also de
nied any statement whereto such a
meaning could be attached.
The scenes In the senate Just now
are without parallel since the Spanish-
American war. Every senator Is pres
ent today and the galleries were
jammed.
The president will make no further
positive move for a showdown on
the support of his contention. A
high administration official said Wil
son would leave it to congress and
the country, feeling confident that the
people of the nation would swing
(congress to bis way of thinking.
Wilson Is determined to apply
"watchful waiting" to congress. He,
wnnts action on a clean cut Issue, and
not on any compromise measure, pre
