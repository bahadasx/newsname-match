NEW HEAD OF INSTITUTION IS
IN COMPLETE AUTHORITY AND
DUAL SYSTEM IN VOGUE FOR
SOME TIME ABOLISHED UN
DER NEW ARRANGEMENT.
PRESIDENT CONTROLS
ALL DEPARTMENTS.
WORST'S CONNECTION WITH
THE SCHOOL CLOSED YESTER
DAY—REGENT'S ISSUE STATE­
MENT GIVING REASONS FOR
DISMISSAL.
Dr. E. F. Ladd, for more than a
-quarter of a century on the faculty of
the North Dakota Agricultural Col
lege, was elected president by the
Aboard of regents late yesterday after
noon.
After several days' investigation of
the difficulties and troubles at the col
lege the board removed Dr. J. H.
"Worst from the presidency and im
mediately elected Dr. Ladd. He ac
cepted the position and entered at once
upon his duties and is in full author
ity.
Apart from his national fame and
the remarkable record he has made
as the head of the pure food commis
sion, Dr. Ladd is a capable executive
and his long connection with the col
lege assures intelligent and able dis
charge of the duties of the position.
The board of regento issued the fol
lowing statement in regard to the col
lege last evening:
Regents' Statement
"Dr. Ladd was given the position
with the distinct understanding that
he would be retained as the head of
the state pure food commission at the
college, and would be permitted to
•give his personal direction to this
work, and be granted whatever addi
tional assistance would be required.
Abolish Dual System.
"The dual system in vogue at the
Agricultural college during the past
two years has been abolished, and the
original plan of making the president
responsible head of the institution is
restored, an arrangement with which
Director Cooper most heartily con
«urs.
"Dr. Ladd will be held responsible
by the board for the conduct of the in
stitution.
"The director of the experiment
stations and the .heads of all depart
ments will be directly responsible to
"President Ladd.
No Wholesale Changes.
•"The state board of regents has an
nounced there are to be no wholesale
changes of the personnel of the facul
ty. For the betterment of the insti
tution a few changes will be impera
tive, but members of the faculty who
are doing satisfactory work are under
:no circumstances to be removed.
"The intention of the state board of
regents is to make the Agricultural
college what it should be, one of the
best agricultural colleges in the coun
try.
Constructive Organization.
"The board will insist on a con
structive organization, the co-ordina
tion of all departments and a harmon
ious and efficient conduct of the col
lege and station interests.
"The state board of regents found
when it assumed its duties July 9th,
1915 that the former individual boards
-of all institutions, had made the ar
rangements for conducting the said
schools for the present scholastic year.
"It was then too late for the board
to make changes, even had the mem
bers the necessary information.
Opposed Hasty Action.
"The board decided against any
"hasty action preferring to proceed
iifter the most careful investigation
conservatively and make changes only
after the most careful investigation
and deliberation.
"Under the provisions of the meas
ure granting the board, a survey com
mission was secured, aind the board
was fortunate in having the co-op
eration of United States Commission
er of Education Claxton, and interest
ing him to such a degree, that he con
sented to direct the work.
E. O. Nestegard and son, Palmer,
of Ramsey, on the Soo, were in the
city yesterday on their way to Grand
Forks for a business and pleasure trip.
FORMER RESIDENT AND PIO
NEER OF RAMSEY COUNTY
PASSES AWAY SUDDENLY AT
HIS CANADIAN HOME.
John Mahoney, who for the past two
years has been holding a homestead
and farming near Admiral, Sask., Ca.,
died very suddenly at his home at
that place the first of the week and
the remains were shipped to Lakota,
where the funeral was held from the
Catholic church Sunday forenoon.
In the early eighties the three Ma
honey brothers located on claims south
east of Crary, they were John, Jerry
and Michael, and for years, they farm
ed there and the two latter are still
prosperous farmers of that vicinity.
While John, who was a bachellor, re
tired from active farming several
years ago, he still owned his land and
also owned a quarter section of land
west of Edmore, besides his holdings
in Canada. He had always been a
hard worker and had accumulated
much property, being considered very
well off. He was a man past sixty
years old at the time of his death. In
the early part of the winter he was
back and spent some time in this coun
ty visiting and attending to business
matters. He had been ailing some
and was not in the best of health when
he left here for his home in the north
west. But the first intimation that
his brothers had that he was even sick
was a telegram announcing his death.
Instructions were given to prepare and
ship the body to Lakota, where the fu
neral was held as above stated. He
was an honest, upright man, and all
who knew him liked him, and he has a
host of friends in this county who will
mourn his death. He leaves two
brothers in this county, Jerry and
Michael, besides a number of other re
latives to mourn.

Tuesday afternoon a transient by
the name of Charles Wagner, and who
was employed by the railroad at Fresh
water suddenly dropped dead, the
cause being hemorrhage. He had ap
parently been in good health, and no
warning that he was ill was given un
til he toppled ever while in the cook
car at that place. Nothing is known
of his relatives.
CURING HAMS AND BACON.
The brine method is the most satis
factory way of curing hams and bacon
on the farm. To sugar cure them ov
er night, rub each piece with salt and
allow it to drain. Then pack in bar
rel with the hams and shoulders in the
bottom, using the strips of bacon to
fill in or place on top.
For each 100 pounds, take 8 pounds
of salt, 2 pounds of brown sugar and
2 ounces of salt peter. Dissolve these
in four gallons of boiling water. Af
ter cooling pour it over the meat
which should be covered. Place a
weight on it to keep it in the brine.
Leave the bacon in the brine 4 to 6
weeks, and the hams 6 to 8 weeks,
then smoke it.
Handle salt pork in the same way,
only use 10 pounds of salt and leave
out the sugar.—North Dak. Experi

W. H. REID IS
CANDIDATE FOR
II
In this issue will be found the an
nouncement of William H. Reid, who
is a candidate for the position of coun
ty treasurer. Mr. Reid is an old-timer
to the people of Ramsey county, and
has a wide acquaintance. He has lived
in this county since the early eighties
and by paying strict attention to. busi
ness he has made a financial success of
his own business, and we believe that
he would be a proper and fit man to
put in charge of the funds of this
county. He is a man of kind and pleas
ing disposition and readily makes
friends wherever he goes, and as he is
widely known over the county he will
no dbttbt make a most formidable ad
visary for others who may enter the
race.
FORMS CITY
Mrs. Jessie Gillan has rented the
room formerly occupied by the State
Bank in the Locke Block and is hav
ing the same neatly remodeled and in
the near future will open up a first
class milinery store. Mrs. Gillan
needs no introduction to the ladies of
Devils Lake and vicinity, as she is an
old resident here and for a time had
charge of the Millinery department at
Mann's. She is an up-to-date milliner
and in opening up this new establish
ment no pains will be spared in giv
ing the people of the Lake Region the
best that money can buy.

AND INtER-OCEAN
After carefully looking over the
field Mr. C. H. Ijbyon, the well known
banker and business man of the town
down the line that bears his name, has
decided that the 'Hudson line of auto
mobiles offers just a little more for
the money than any other car on the
market, and accordingly he has secur
ed the agency for this well known car
and in a few days will have samples
on exhibition in ,this city and also at
his Doyon home.?
The Hudson Sttper-Six, is really be
yond description^ and in order to ap
preciate it you dbust see it and enjoy
a ride in it. From every point of
view it is the last word in auto build
ing, and when you own a Hudson, you
have the best that money will buy at
any price.
If you are thinking of buying a car
this season it will pay you well to wait
and see the Hudson before inverting a
cent. The many new features and the
beautiful body finislrings put this car
in a class by itself. It is the greatest
car for the money ever offered and we
want you to have a chance to look it
over before buying. We expect to
have a car on the ground in a few days
and will be pleased to demonstrate it
to you.
N. in GROWTH
There is just one test of a profitable
business and that is the money in the
bank. Book accounts are worth noth
ing except as a promise of money to
come, but the moj^y in the bank is. the
profit itself. Measured by its banks,
North Dakota has had a phenominal
growth the past few years. In the last
year alone this State has increased its
bank resources over $20,000,000, and
this fine increase continues. In five
business days recently bank clearings
in Grand Forks amounted to $447,000,
almost half a million in money one of
these days ran well over a hundred
thousand dollars.
A study of the bank statistics show
that since the year 1900, North Dako
ta has made wonderful gains. In 1900
this state had only 207 banks, now she
has 640. In 1900 the total deposits in
North Dakota banks amounted to only
$14,730,000 while now the total is
$111,001,000. An interesting fact is
shown when we consider that in the
fifteen years, 1900-1915, with the ex
ception of two, North Dakota has
shown more total deposits in her banks
than South Dakota, and this notwith
standing the fact that her sister state
is older and has, to within the past two
or three years, had more people.

Joe Gault, a printer working on the
Munich Herald fell and injured a crip
pled leg Monday, and the injury caus
ed a loss of much blood. It was de
termined that the only thing would
save his life would be an operation
and he was accordingly taken aboard
the train and started for Grand Forks
in company with a physician. How
ever, owing to the great loss of blood
he was unable to withstand the shock
and passed away just about the time
the train reached Brocket. The re
mains were taken off the train at Lako
ta and taken to the undertaker where
they were prepared for shipment and
shipped back to Munich where the fu
neral was held. He was about thirty
years old and the only known relative
is a mother living in the western part
of the state.
BOTTLERS ARE
THIS WEEK
Monday and Tuesday of this week
the Northern Minnesota and North
Dakota Bottlers Association was in
session at the Commercial Club rooms
in this city. There was a good at
tendance and many matters of impor
tance was taken up by the association.
One of the important features of the
meeting was" an address by Dr. Ladd,
pure food expert, who talked on the
matter of raising the standard of all
goods and drink products of the state.
POWELL'S HAT
IN THE RING
A. M. Powell, the veteran real es- 'tho«eh
tate and insurance man, has decided
that he would see just how it seems to
be in politics and therefore has made
formal announcement of his candidacy
for the office of treasurer of this coun
ty. Mr. powell is an old-timer in this
county, and probably no man has a
wider acpuaintance in the county than
he has. He has many warm friends
who will, no doubt, be boosting for him
from now until after the primaries.
Mrs. M. O. Simonstad expects to
leave tomorrow for Fargo where ihe
will spend a day or two visiting
friends.

Uuder a Devils Lake date line of
February 28, there appeared in the
Grand Forks Herald the following
communication relative to the candi
dacy of F. T, Cuthbert for Congress.
As Mr. Cuthbert is and has been in
California for some time, and
return possibly for several
will not
days \vu
are unable to learn wit'* r.u'.'.:-..:l':y
whether he will be a candidate or not
but he has hosts of friends over this
section of the state who have been
urging him to become a candidate,
and it is freely predicted that he will
enter the campaign and make the race.
The following is the article as appear,
ed in the Herald.
Devils Lake, N. D., Feb. 28.—F. T.
Cuthbert, of Devils Lake, a prominent
ly known attorney, will oppose H. T.
Helgesen for the republican nomina
tion for congress from the First dis
trict.
Announcement of Mr. Cuthbert's in
tention to oppose Mr. Helgesen was
made here today, and it is understood
that his campaign will be launched
immediately upon his return to the
state from California, where he is at
the present time.
Attorney Cuthbert, a resident of
Devils Lake for many years, has not
been prominently alligned with either
faction of the republican party and his
friends believe that he is in an envia
ble position to make the race against
the present holder of congressional
honors.
The way for Congressman Helgesen
has been decidedly easy during the
last few years. In the most recent el
ection he was without formidable op
position for the republican nomination
while in the general election he won
over Fred Bartholomew of Grand
Forks by the usual republican margin.
Mr. puthbert, in, entering: the iroce,
believes the time is ripe for a new
man to try the game as against Hel
gesen.
The Devils Lake entrant will ask for
election on a platform that will be
rather progressive in its tendencies.
That much, at least, is known of the
new candidate's plans.
Congressman Helgeson was origi
nally elected to congress from the 1st
district thru the backing of the pro
gressive republicans. In the interval
since his first election a portion of his
support has dropped away from him,
the
exact extent of such devia-
tion is uncertain.
CODRT MEETS
The regular March term of the dis
trict court will convene in this city
next Monday, March 6th. There are
nine criminal cases and 54 civil cases
on the calendar. As there are not
many important cases the outlook is
that it will not be a very long term.
MORE TREES IN NORTH DAKOTA
One of the needed improvements in
our state is the addition of trees.
Trees grown all over North Dakota
would mean a great increase in the at
tractiveness of our state, and an added
value to every acre of farm land in the
state.
In many parts of the state the Far
mers Clubs are interesting themselves
in tree planting and a movement of
this kind is now on in Grand Forks
county where the assistance of the
state Sshool of Forrestry has been se
cured and a tree campaign is being
put on in connection with the Better
Farming Association work. North
Dakota will grow the finest trees. All
that is needed is to interest the differ
ent committees in planting and car
ing for them andthis work is well
worth the time and thought of any
farmers' club in the state.
TEN YEAR OLD ALFALFA.
In 1905 Grimm Alfalfa was sown at
the Dickinson Sub-Station. The stand
is good yet. There is no indication of
the older plants having died.
Afield of Grimm Alfalfa wag also
sow at the Edgeley Sub-Station the
same year it is still doing well and
has shown no signs of winter-killing.

MEETING OF THE COUNTY CEN
TRAL COMMITTEE TUESDAY
UNANIMOUSLY ENDORSE W. H.
BEL.ORD FOR POSTMASTER
HERE.
Tuesday afternoon at the court
house in this city there was a meeting
of the Democratic central committee,
the same having been calle to take up
the matter of endorsing a candidate
for the position of postmaster in this
city. At present Mr. Bloom is holding
the position, but has asked to he re
lieved, and the name of H. S. Daviei
was sent up to the Senate, but this
was not satisfactory to the Demo
crats of the county, and they decide
to call a meeting to take some action
and the call was made to convene
Tuesday afternoon. There v*a* a good
representative meeting, and alter the
matter was talked over tho name of
W. H. Belford was presented and un
animously selected as the man for the
place. Mr. Belford is an old Demo
crat and has done much for his party
and there is no doubt but the choice
gives general satisfaction to the Dem
ocrats of the county an to the pat
rons of the office.
MIGRATORY BIRD LAW
CONTINUES IN FORCE.
Washington, Mar. 1st.—A mislead
ing statement has recefitly become
current in the newspapers of the Mis
sissippi Valley and elsewhere, to the
effect that the Department of Agricul
ture has suspended the enforcement of
the Federal regulations under the
.Migratory Bird Law and by this
means has enables sportsmen, under
State laws, to shoot mid fowl the com
ing spring.
Under the Federal regulations as
they now stand, the season on all mi
gratory wild fowl is closed until next
autumn throughout the United States.
Federal inspectors and wardens are
required, and others interested in the
protection of wild fowl are requested,
to report to the Department of Agri
culture all classes of violations of the
regulations, in order thi.t proper ac
tion may be taken.
The Department
0f
Agriculture had
no power to suspend the law or to
pardon violations of the regulations.
Doubtless the errneous impression, on,
which the newspaper statements are
based, has drawn out of the pendency
of litigation involving the constitu
tionality of the Act of Congress ap
proved March 4,1913, under which the
regulations were promulgated. The
lower Federal courts disagreed as to
the validity of the statute and the is
sue was carried to the Supreme Court
of the United States. The case was
argued in the Supreme Court in OtS.
1915, but has not been decided. Fol
lowing the lower court decisions, Con
gress appropriated money for thj pur
pose of continuing the enforcement of
the law. The Department of Agri
culture is bound to report to the De
partment of Justice violations of the
regulations if tlie Supreme Court
should declare the law constitutional.
All persons should, therefore, be
warned of the danger they incur from
failure to abide by the regulations.
THE OLD SILVER DOLLAR.
How dear to our hearts is the old sil
ver dollar,
When some kind subscriber presents
it to view—
The liberty head, without necktie or
collar,
And all the strange things that to
us seem so new
The wide spreading eagle, the arrows
below it,
The ftars and the words with the
queer things they tell.
The coin of our fathers! We're glad
that we know it,
For sometime or other 'twill come
in right well—
But why some subscribers keep us
waiting so long
Is o^o of the things we never could
tell.
