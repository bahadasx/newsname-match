BABE WITH WIS
ROBERT G. SINCLAIR, DEPRAVED
YOUNG MAN, KILLS HIS ILLE­
GITIMATE CHILD AT WAHPE-
TON HOTEL.
A two-week8-old baby girl, born un­
der the stigma of illegitimacy, lies
buried in a cemetery at Wahpeton,
having been murdered by a depraved
father, Robert G. Sinclair, son of Mr.
and Mrs. W. E. Sinclair, who operate a
hotel at Stirum, N. D. Sinclair has
confessed to the crime and lies in the
Richland county jail. It is believed
that the mother was not implicated in
the crime.
The mother is the daughter of high­
ly respected parents, farmers living in
the vicinity of Stirum. The woman
seems to have been under the complete
influence of Sinclair, a worthless fel­
low. The couple took their babe to
Wahpeton and registered at a hotel
as man and wife, under assumed
names. The man promised to place
the babe on a door step. He got the
girl to go into the bathroom on some
pretext, when he murdered the babe
by stabbing it in the head several
times with a pair of scissors. Placing
the body in a suit case, he carried it
to an outhouse vault, depositing it
there. After he had confessed, the
remains were found where he said
they were placed. The couple when
questioned, said the child had# been
sent to the home of a relative at
Terry, Mont., but when examined sep­
arately, the young woman said that
the father had taken the child and
placed it on some one's doorstep. Lat­
er the father confessed but he did not
appear to realize fhe enormity of his
crime. He will undoubtedly spend the
remainder of his days behind the bars.
MINOT LAD WITH THE ALLIES.
George Graves, a former Minot
school boy, is now fighting with the
Allies in the trenches at Verdun.
George is the son of F. E. Graves, for­
mer Minot real estate dealer, now of
San Diego, Cal. He is a soldier of for­
tune. He has an adventurour spirit.
He has traveled widely in Mexico and
South America.
NEW ROCKFORD MURDERER
GETS TWENTY-FIVE YEARS.
Nicholas Chernos, the New Rpck
fiord murderer, was found guilty of
killing his employer, George Kittle,
Feb. 10, and sentenced to serve 25
years in the penitentiary.
Chernos had hoped to go free, the
defense being insanity. Rittle, while
lighting the kitchen fire, was shot
three times by Chernos, one bullet
penetrating the liver, and the other
two lodging near the heart. A report
was given out that Rittle had shot
himself. A doctor was not called un­
til in the afternoon.
PUN TRIP TO
J. M. ANDERSON, EQUITY HEAD,
TELLS OF MOVE TO DEMAND
FEDERAL GRAIN EXCHANGE.
J. M. Anderson, president of the
Equity Co-operative Exchange, has re­
turned to St. Paul from Minot, where
he attended a meeting of the North
Dakota Society of Equity and secured
the adoption of a resolution to charter
a special train to carry from 500 to
1000 northwestern farmers to Wash­
ington in time for the inauguration of
the president next year.
"The idea is to impress upon the of­
ficers of the Federal government the
importance of the open market, said
Mr. Anderson. "We hope to have del­
egations from Illinois, Kansas and Ne­
braska as well as from Minnesota and
the two Dakotas.
"The specific measures we propose
to advocate are federal control of
grain exchanges to prevent monopoly
Federal aid for the establishment of
laws to prevent discrimination on the
part of the grain exchanges such as
the Minneapolis Chamber of Com­
merce practices against the St. Paul
Grain Exchange and ordinary business
courtesies.
"The time has arrived when the bt.
Paul Grain Exchange will want to be
represented on all the big grain ex­
changes of the country, and we want
it made impossible or at least illegal
for these big exchanges to give us a
cold deal such as we received in Min­
neapolis.
We hope to impress upon the people
in Washington the fact that the farm­
ers are in earnest in demanding an
open market for all their products.
Farmers' Club Will Buy Merchandise.
A meeting of the Eureka Farmers
Club was held at the home of Mr. and

son in large quantities for the club.
The club will meet once a month, the
next meeting to be held at the home
IISWMM
of H. A. Monagin, the third Thursday
in March.
The club expressed gratification at
the way the Bergseth Fish Co. treated
them. The club won the 200 pounds
of ludefisk during the Mid-winter Fair
and the company allowed them the
privilege of taking out the fish as
needed, insuring a fine fresh quality.
JOINT CIVIC IMPROVEMENT

the forces for attack and hopes to kill
the bill in the Senate.
NORTIDAKOTA
RANKS FIRST AMONG
AGRICULTURAL ST/ITES
NEBRASKA STATE FOARD OF
AGRICULTURE GIVES PALM
TO SUNSHINE STATE—REC­
ORD BREAKING STATISTICS.
For some time it has been known
that North Dakota led all other ag ri­
cultural states in the matter of the
£ve j.rincipal gidins for the year 1915,
but it remains for the Nebraska State
Board of Agriculture tj go a step
further and make a recapitulation of
all the agricultural production, includ­
ing live stock. The Association of
Commerce has just received a copy of
the recapitulation and it sure reads
good.
For instance, the total value of all
products of the farm give North Da­
kota $327,073,000, while our nearest
competitor, South Dakota,, rambles
along with only $310,691,000. Ne­
braska is next, and then comes Iowa,
Kansas, Minnesota, Illinois, Wisconsin,
Indiana, Missouri, Texas, etc.
In the matter of grain crops, this
report gives $372 for every man, wo­
man and child in ,lfqrth Dakota, or
over $1.00 a day foe each (inhabitant.
Our leading four-crops is given as
being valued at $191,153,000, thus
showing that With less than half of
the plowable land under cultivation,
we have much to be proud of.
Our live stock statistics show up ex­
ceedingly well, when it is taken into
consideration that North Dakota has
only been doing intensive farming for
approximately five years. At the rate
the farmers are going into diversified
farming in this state, in five years
more North Dakota will give a mighty
good account of herself in this partic­
ular.
In the old cattle days much ado was
made over the fact that 4,000 carloads
of cattle were shipped off the ranches
of the state a year, while in 1914 over
13,800 carloads were shipped out of
the state, thus showing that the good
old cattle days were not in it.
It should surely be an easy matter
for the land men of this state to do
business this year, for they have so
much to talk about in the way of ac­
tual results, which, together with our
tremendous resources, can not fail to
attract new settlers from the older
states, where land values are all out
of proportion to the agricultural pro­
duction.
This year—191G—should be a ban­
ner year for our great state, and ev­
erybody should get their shoulder
against the wheel and push hard.
FLIM-FLAM ARTIST
BROTTO HNOT
J. A. MEYER, DEVILS LAKE JAIL
BIRD, ARRESTED BY WARD
COUNTY OFFICIALS AND BROT
TO FACE SERIOUS CHARGE.
J. A. Meyer, who completed a term
of 30 days in the Ramsey county jail
at Devils Lake for issuing worthless
checks, was met at the door of the jail
by a Ward county deputy sheriff and
placed under arrest charged with do­
ing a like stunt in Minot. He was
brot to this city where he is lying in
the county jail awaiting his hearing.
Meyer is the big fellow who flim-flam
med his friends in more ways than one
in Minot and if he does not get a jail
sentence in Minot, those who he has
imposed upon will always believe that
it is another case of miscarriage of
justice.
Senator Englund of Kenmare was in
the city Tuesday on his way to Mc
Kenzie county, where he has interests.

THE WARD COUNTY INDEPENDENT
DODGE BROTHERS APPRECIATE
WONDERFUL SHOWING MADE
BY NORTHWEST MOTOR COM­
PANY.
At the Minot Auto Show, Dodge
Brothers, of Detroit, will exhibit the
plain stock chassis which has been ex­
hibited at all the eastern shows as a
mark of special favor to the North­
west Motor Company, their distrib­
utors thruout this territory.
The Northwest Motor Co. was or­
ganized for the purpose of distribut­
ing Dodge cars in northwest North
Dakota and eastern Montana and to­
day the concern ranks second to Min­
neapolis in the number of cars actual­
ly sold, a record remarkable from the
fact that Dodge Brothers have the
best sales organization of any auto­
mobile company in the world.
The purchaser of a Dodge car has
the advantage of doing business with
a concern carrying a complete stock
of parts and accessories, a service
which comparatively few owners of
automobiles enjoy, as the manufac­
turers of many cars make no provis­
ion for supplying the needs of the
purchasers of their cars. The North­
west Motor Co., thru their various
agencies, maintain 53 service stations
for the convenience of their patrons.
This concern established their head
juarters in Minot one year ago and up
to July 1, 1915, had sold fifty-four
Dodge Brothers Motor cars, when a
new contract was signed for the 1916
cars. The contract called for 500 cars,
but that number has since been in­
creased to 600. To date the North­
west Motor Co. has sold and delivered
363 cars, valued at $306,735. A con­
servative estimate of the business for
this year places the valuation of the
cars sold at one-half million dollars.
Dodge Brothers have a unique meth­
od, or rather policy, in their relations
with owners of Dodge cars. They
keep in touch with every owner and
stand ready at any and all times to
render him servicc by way of advice,
or suggestion, that may be of value in
matters pertaining to his car. The
Northwest Mptor Co. is in entire sym­
pathy with the system and co-operate
heartily along those lines. They sell
the Dodge on its merits, offering no
special inducements to customers and
holding forth no alluring promises.
Quality, not price, is the watchword.
The Dodge car "speaks for itself."

sistance in the chemistry department
as he desires.
Ladd is one of the state's best citi­

CO. CASE DISPLEASES
WARD
COUNTY COMMISSIONERS
ASKED TO RESCIND ACTION
SETTLING CASE OF THE STATE
LOAN CO. FOR TAXES.
i:
Petitions were circulated in this city
and in other parts of the county the
latter part of last week which will be
presented to the county commissioners
asking them to rescind the settlement
of the case of the State Loan Co.,
against Ward County, by which set­
tlement the county accepted $3,000 in
payment of taxes aggregating $11,000.
The settlement was made under the
authority of a law passed by the last
legislature which has since been found
unconstitutional.
In the petition, the commissioners
are asked not only to rescind such
Settlement, but they also are asked to
institute proceedings against the
State Loan company, for the recovery
of all taxes originally assessed.
The settlement between the county
and the State Loan Company was
made after the loan concern had start­
ed suit against the county to have the
assessment set aside as excessive and
illegal.
Settlement was perfected by the
county under a provision laid down by
the last legislature, since declared un­
constitutional, by wheih provision the
legislature attempted to create a basis
for the settlement of all old assess­
ments which might, at that time, have
been placed in jeopardy through liti­
gation.
The provision was made a part of
the moneys and credits act of the
state legislatude, since declared uncon­
stitutional, and in its decision of this
issue, the supreme court took occasion
to score quite roundly the inclusion of
certain features of the law.
Under the provision in question, the
counties were authorized to accept 25
per cent of the moneys and credits
taxes that might be tied up in litiga­
tion, and it was such settlement that
Ward county made. This settlement,
it is now contended, was illegal and
without warrant of the law, in view of
the fact that the measure under which
it was made has been since declared
illegal.

A park commissioner is to be elect­

BELIEVE VAN HOOK
MAN WAS MURDERED
FRANK MOREHOUSE, AGED 25,
FOUND DEAD AT HOME OF
FRANK KACZOR, NORTH OF
VAN HOOK.
Frank Morehoyse, a farmer living
eight miles north of Van Hook, was
found dead at the home of Frank Kac
zor, who lives four miles north of that
town, Feb. 19. At first it was believ­
ed that he committed suicide, a bullet
hole being located behind his right
ear.
According to a report from Stanley,
Morehouse was the victim of foul play.
The victim was to have" been married
in three weeks and it is known that
he had a considerable sum of money
on his person in anticipation of the
event. No money was found on the
body. An investigation by the coro­
ner's jury found that the man was
murdered.
It is said that Morehouse had gone
rt^v „),i„ j,-1 TTW»APAIY
to Van Hook that day for medicine
and becoming ill, had stopped at Kac
zor's house. It was reported that he
had been despondent and this is the
reason that it was believed at first
that he had committed suicide. The
man was 25 years of age and highly
respected.

HIGH SCHOOL BUILDING.
Architect Hulse of St. Paul, Minn.,
and Hutchinson, Kan., was awarded
the contract to furnish plans and spec­
ifications for Minot's new high school
building at a special meeting of the
board Saturday night. The plans sub­
mitted were all excellent, but those of
Mr. Hulse from the start seemed to
meet with the favor of the board.
The board hopes to be able to go
ahead with the building early in the
summer, as the Minot schools are sad­
ly crowded for room. The proposed
building will cost in the neighborhood
of $85,000 and will be constructed ac­
cording to the unit system, so that
wings may be added as needed and
the finances of the district permit.

STUDENTS RESENT
SHELVING OF WORST
RECORD FOR NORTH DAKOTA
FARM COLLEGE PRESIDENT IS
DEFENDED BY THE SCHOOL
PAPER.
Fargo, N. D., Feb. 25.—That there
is much indignation and still more ap­
prehension among the students of the
North Dakota agricultural college as a
result of the action of the state board
of regents in electing President John
H. Worst as president emeritus, which
is accepted by President Worst as be­
ing "fired" from the institution, is
shown by an editorial from The Spec­
trum, the student publication.
The editorial says: "If the board
carries out its policy it means that
'prexy' will be eventually disgraced.
Will you see this done?
Showing that there is great appre­
hension as to what the ultimate re­
sults will be the editorial continues:
"He stood by us for over 20 years.
He has advanced means by which we
could obtain the things worth while in
the institution.
"Now we, the students, stand a good
chance of having all these things that
are worth while taken away from us.
The Spectrum, Agassiz, the Little
Country theatre, the package library,
Bolley and Ladd, are only a few of
them. Others are being considered.
What do you say to that?"
Further on," some demands are set
forth. "Then let the students demand:
That if a clean-up is to be made let
those professors who coulr! not teach
Sunday school go with those who are
not in accord with the present powers,
that if a new president is to be ap­
pointed let him be a man from outside
the state—'way outside. Let us also
demand that he be an educator and
that he be interested in agriculture.
Let us demand that the Little Country
theatre, the Agassiz and the Spec­
trum, but especially the Little Country
theatre, be retained in the institution."
