Disregarding the insult to the
Florida Parishes, which are en
tirely agricultural and the people
<)f which have always bee: c >! -
spicious fur their independence ii,
politics, this paragraph is most
important as a confession of
blundering or worse by Mr. Par
ker and the convention he bossed.
If Mr. Wilson, to whom Mr.
Parker refers, is not equipped to
serve the farmers' interest in the
agricultural department, why,
may it be asked, did not Mr. Par,
ker pick a capable farmer and
put him on his own ticket'
He nominated Mr. Broussard,
brother of the United States Seni
ator, in the hope, we take it, that
the more distinguished member
of the Broussard family would
thereby be persuaded to stay at
Washington and the Bull Moose
fight in the Third district be ren
dered the less difficult.
He nominated Mr. Dubuisson
for attorney general out of a
petty spirit of revenge against
Judge Coco, for exercising a
Louisiana freeman's right Lo
critioile the Parker brand of
polities.
But, either deliberately or neg
lectfully, he overlooked the
farmer's interest when he was
playing politics in the case of
one nomination and exhibiting
his autocracy of spirit in the
other, and at least it does lie in
IIS mouth, at this late day to
arraign the Democratic party or
affront the people of the Florida
parishes in connection with the
agricultural department.-Daily

place John A. Parker in the g, v
r-rnor's chair, with hiR fanatical
ideas, against whibih S) per cent
of the voters of the state are now
lined up, would be the height of
fully. Seventy-two voters of
.Jennings have signed a call for
a meeting Tuesday night for the
Iurp,,se of orgalnizing an iiide
1ender;t delnot'cratic party, its
I,,ject being to get votes flr
J lin M. Parker for ;ov\-er. Cr.
I)emocratics of Jennings, do you
realize what you are doing? Do
you realize the fact that Col.
Pleasant will be Louisiana's
next governor? Have you fur
gotten that you voted at the pri
mary just four weeks ago and
that when you voted at that pri
mary you ohligated yourselves to
support the nominee. Now if the
democratic nominee for go ,ernor
was a man of questionable char
acter, of if it could be truthfully
said that he is subject to boss
dictation, then you might have
some excuse for bolting, but i
since it is a fact, and you know
it is a fact, that Col. Pleasant
whipped the Cresent City bosses
in the Constitutional Convention I
election last summer, and you al
so know that these same bosses
don't like Col. Pleasant, but that
they are supporting him because
they believe him to he a winner
and capable of "trimming" any
man in the state, within his party
or without. And he will triw
Mr. Parker on April 1, 1916.
