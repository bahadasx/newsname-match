PRESIDENT INSISTS
UPO N A RECORD VOTE
Tells Congress That No Compromise Proposition,
Such as a Vote of Confidence in His Foreign
Policy, Will be Acceptable to Him.
CONGRESS WILL MEET TODAY FACING CLEARCUT ISSUE
WASHINGTON, March 1.—Presi
dent Wilson served notices on con
gress tonight thnt he will consent to
nothing less titan a record vote on
tlte anti-administration resolutions to
warn Americans off the armed ships
of European belligerents before he
goes on with the submarine negotia
linns.
No compromise proposition such us
a vote of confidence in the president's
foreign policy, will be acceptable. Such
an action, it is held, might be con
strued in Berlin as justifying the opin
ion that the president lacks the sup
port of congress and Ids own party
in his demands for a full observance
of international law while Us only
purpose would be to afford members
<>t congress a way to avoid recording
their positions before the country on
the straight out-and-out question.
President Wilson made ids position
clear to congressional leaders tonight
in unequivocal terms as the climax!
to a day of confusion, uncertainty and
political maneuvering, which marked
congress'" 16 °'' r<3a ' WUh

negotiations witli Germany, until the
As if to emphasize that the presi
rr » r ,
negotiations with Germany, until the
attitude of congress has been settled,
U was made known that the United
States does not consider the latest
assurances from Count von Ilernstorff,
the German ambassador, as broad or
as ff_those originally gi v
No further step will be taken,
however, while the president waits on
congress. Meanwhile the pending
Lusitania agreement will not be final
ly accepted.
The whole situation in congress, con
fused by the president's call yester
day for a vote, was thrown into a
snarl today when at an early morning
conference the president outlined his
position to Senators Stone and Kern,
and Representative Flood, chairman
of the foreign affairs committee of
the house. Speaker Clark, House Lead
er Kitchin and Acting Chairman Pou
of the house rules committee.
As soon as the delegation returned
to the capitol with news of what the
president hid said, it was apparent
that, some of tho leaders who had se
cretly supported the anti-administra-1
(ton forces and under administration
pressure. had pocketed resolutions in
committee when there was danger of
their being adopted realied that tho!
president and his fr'ionds had sudden
iy gained the whip hand. It was plain
that they once devoted their efforts
to attemnts to avoid a defeat at the
ing the fight turn to a vote on a reso-j
lutlon of confidence for the president!
In which they could join without com
promising their position in support "f
warning Americans to avoid belliger
wit armed ships.
Practically in control of the marhin-!
ery of tho house, those leaders held
the situation in deadlock all day while
they conferred and sought for some
proposals which would satisfy the
president and still save their positions.
Friends of the president, watching
tlte maneuvering closely, saw the ob
ject, and tonight from the White
House came word that there would
ho no compromise. Congress will
meet tomorrow facing a cleareut issue!
with the president.
The president's friends openly
charge that resistance to his program^"
is purely political. They make it un
mistakably clear that he does not in
tend to let the question be passed over
bv a compromise and risk being ent
hand. They say he intends to have
the question removed once and for all
from the field of possibilities and

chairmen of the foreign affairs com
mittees in both branches of congress
and even Speaker Clark, were, to say
tlte least, lukewarm in their support
