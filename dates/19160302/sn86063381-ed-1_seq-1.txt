Plans are being discussed today
for anti-aircraft guns to be used in
protecting Bemidji and Bemidjites
from night attacks by "hostile" aero
planes.
The "mysterious aeroplane" was
seen again last evening by several
people.
Hears Motor.
Clarence Poucault, a brakeman on
the Minnesota & International rail
way, claims to have heard the whirl
of the motor.
"We were near Funkley," said Mr.
Poucault to a Pioneer representative
today, "when I heard the whirl of
the motor of the aeroplane. It was
about 9:45 o'clock the engine had
stopped and I was just turning the
switch when I heard the whirl of the
motor. I looked up and saw the out
line of an aeroplane north of Funk
ley. I raised my cap and could very
plainly hear the motor. The ma
chine was traveling at a high rate
of speed."
Not a Balloon.
"Could the machine have been a
toy balloon?" Mr. Foucault was
asked.
"No, sir," answered Mr. Foucault.
"It was an aeroplane."
A large number of people in Be
midji were looking for the air prowl
er last night. Many people claim to
have seen the lights and several
claim to have heard the whirl of the
motor. Several insisted that they
could distinguish the outline of the
machine. In each instance the ma
chine was going toward the east.
John Rowe was the first in Be
midji to see the machine. He re
ported seeing the machine Tuesday
evening at 9:30 o'clock going west.
The machine was reported last eve
ning as going west.

Nelse Johnson Returns From Mexico
Visiting With Brother, Sheriff
Andrew Johnson.
CHINAMAN RESPECTED

Have Little Faith in Carranza Gov

Raided.
"It is hard to tell in Mexico who
is the more respected, the Chinaman
or the American."
This was a statement made today
by Nelse Johnson of Minneapolis who
has just returned from Mexico and
is visiting his brother, Sheriff An
drew Johnson.
Demonstrates Tractor.
Mr. Johnson, who is a demonstra
tor of the Big Four tractor, went to
Los Muchos, Mexico, to demonstrate
several tractors. He was there for
four weeks.
"The Mexicans," said Mr. Johnson,
"have no faith in the Carranza gov
ernment. Leaders keep saying there
is something in the wind and they ap
pear to be waiting for something.
Don't Like Wilson.
"The Mexicans don't like Presi
dent Wilson. Neither do the Amer
icans in Mexico. They state that if
the president would devote one-tenth
of his time to Mexico that he is now
devoting to the European war, that
good results could be secured. I did
not hear one person speak a good
word for the Wilson administration.
"My trip to Mexico was very in
teresting. It took five days to go
500 miles, the trains only running
during the daytime. Bridges have
been burned out, telegraph offices de
stroyed and villages have been raided
by bandits and Indians. In most places
the people appeared afraid of the In
dians.
"Since the last revolution I was
told that the Mexicans are twice as
independent as they formerly were
and that the majority of them would
steal anything. I found that out be
fore I had been there a short time.
Someone stole my note book."
Mr. Johnson visited in Bemidji with
his brother three years ago after re
turning from a trip to Argentina and
Spain. POLICE STAR IS

THE CUB

FISH SPAWN TO
BE TAKEN FROM
LAKES NEAR HERE
Game Warden Bailey to Have Charge
of Crew in New Hatchery
Experiments.
AVERY TO INVESTIGATE
WOLF AND BEER CASES
Closed Season for Pike Warden is
Given New
Powers.
Bemidji will be the center of sev
eral experiments in connection with
fish hatching, according to plans
made known to S. C. Bailey, local
game warden, today, by Carlos Av
ery, state game and fish commissioner,
and E. W. Cobb, superintendent of
fish hatcheries.
Begin in-April.
Spawn nets and apparatus for the
gathering of fish spawn are to be
placed in operation in April.
Warden Bailey has made several
investigations during this winter and
the inlet into Wolf Lake and outlet
of Turtle river have been selected as
the locality for conducting the ex
periments.
Pond nets have been shipped and
will be installed at the two points.
Spawn will be caught and collected
and after large quantities have been
secured shipments will be made to
fish hatcheries.
Three crews will be kept at work
under the direction of Mr. Bailey.
Pike Season Closed.
On account of the spawning season
it is unlawful to catch or have in pos
session at this time any pike. May
first is the opening of the pike sea
son. Rough fish can be speared un
til April 1.
In enforcement of the laws this
year more power is given the game
wardens, according to a notice from
the state executive commissioner. The
law which empowers the wardens,
reads: Any officer charged with the
enforcement of laws protecting fish
and game, may, without a warrant,
enter and inspect all camps, boats,
wagons, cars, tents and other recepta
cles, where he has reason to believe
that fish or game taken or held in
violation of the laws of this state
are eo be found.
Many Wolves Killed.
In a report of Mr. Bailey's, recent
ly filed, it was pointed out that not
less than 300 wolves had been killed
within the last three months. In
December bounties to the sum of $600
were issued by the county auditor,
making the monthly toll of wolves
at eighty. During January, $525
in bounties were issued for the hides
of 70 wolves and in February, $1,020
was issued in bounties for 150 wolves.
This makes a total of $2,145 which
has been paid in bounties for 300
wolves.
Mr. Avery intends to make a visit
to Bemidji in the near future to in
vestigate conditions and prevent a
wholesale killing of deer by wolves.
Such ravages were not carried on un
til the snow had melted, allowing the
deer to escape from the wolves,
who would sink into the deep snow,
making travel impossible. Mr. Av
ery intends to launch a system for
making game and fish protection a
matter of education.

WILSON DEMANDS
A RECORD VOTE
Senate Agrees to Vote on Measure
President Refuses to Accept
Compromise.
Washington, March 2.-President
Wilson served notice on congress to
day that he will consent to nothing
less than a record vote on the anti
administration resolution to warn
Americans off the armed ships of Eu
ropean belligerents before he goes on
with the Gerban submareine negotia
tions.
No compromise proposition, such
as a vote of confidence in the presi
dent's foreign pplioy, wll be af
ceptable. Such an action, it is held,
might be construed in Berlin as justi
fying the opinion that the president
lacks the support of congress and his
own party in his demands for a full
observance of international law, while
its only purpose would be to avoid
members of congress a way to avoid
recording their position before the
country on the straight out-and-out
question.
President Wilson made his position
clear to congressional leaders in un
equivocal terms.
The congressional-presidential con
flict broke in the senate this after
noon when Senator Stone interrupted
a discussion on the Shields bill to
make a statement. It was agreed
that the question should come to a
vote immediately.

STANTON DENIES
PETITION FOR
JUDICIAL DITCH
Judge Refuses to Allow the Establish
ment of No. 41 in Towns
157 to 160.
NO PUBLIC NECESSITY
COST OVER $400,000
In Memorandum States Project Pre
mature Proposed in Sparsely
Settled Portion.
Judge C. W. Stanton of the dis
trict court today denied the petition
for the establishment and the con
struction of Judicial Ditch No. 41,
on account of the fact that the pro
posed ditch will not be of such pub
lic benefit as will be commensurate
with the estimated and probable cost
and because there is no public neces
sity for the ditch.
The memorandum of Judge Stan
ton's ruling is as follows:
'The proposed ditch is in a sparsely
settled portion of northern Beltrami
county, in Towns 157 to 160, and
Ranges 32 to 35, between the Rapid
river and the Canadian Northern rail
way, and as petitioned for, with its
branches, will comprise more than
two hundred miles of ditch construc
tion. The cost of construction, it is
estimated, will be in excess of $400,-
000.
"I am convinced that the project
is premature and that under present
conditions, taking into consideration
the already heavy bonded indebted
ness of the county for the construc
tion of other ditches, the court is not
warranted in even making an order
for the preliminary work of a sur
vey, with its incident cost. I under
stand the law to be that the question
whether a proposed ditch may be con
structed at all depends primarily up
on whether it will be a public benefit
and further that this question may
be determined either at the prelimin
ary hearing upon the petition or at
the second or final reading. I pre
fer, therefore, to determine and de
clare at this time that the public
ftenefit wfrteh might-reasrit "sriifeact be
such as to justify the court, in the
exercise of sound discretion, in pro
ceeding further into the matter.
"It is perhaps not inappropriate for
me to say that, in my opinion, the
care and maintenance of the ditches
and contiguous roadways now exist
ing and in process of construction in
the county, will impose such a bur
den upon the county and townships
(for which no adequate provision has
yet been made) that it will be unwise
to add 200 miles more to the burden,
as would be one of the consequences
of establishing the proposed ditch.
"Further, I have recently discussed
the general ditch situation in this
county with the Board of County
Commissioners and I find each mem
ber of that body to be strongly of
the opinion that such a project as the
one now under consideration should
friot be favored. I understand them to
base their opinions, first, upon the
ground that the required bonded in
debtedness would be such as to men
ace the credit of the county, and sec
ond, that the burden of maintenance
could not be properly provided for.
"For the reasons herein briefly set
forth, I feel constrained to deny the
petition and to refuse to order a sur-
vey."
SL06AN CAMPAI6N
TO BE HELD HERE
Plans are being made by the Be
midji Merchants association to hold
a slogan campaign in this city soon.
If plans are carried out merchants
will offer prizes for the best slogan.
W. Z. Robinson is in charge of the

prepared by members of the associa
tion. The articles will be published.
