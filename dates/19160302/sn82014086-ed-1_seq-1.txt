sistant county prosecutor, who testi
fied before the congressional commit
tee which is investigating impeach
ment charges brought against United
States District Attorney Marshall by
Congressman Frank Buchanan of Illi

known such a practice in any other
court and that he had sent a written
protest to Mr. Marshall in regard to

M'CLENNEN CONTINUES
DEFENSE OF BRANDEIS.
Gives Details of United Shoe Machin
ery Co. Dealings.
Washington March 1. The relations
of Louis t. Brandeis to the United
Shoe Machinery company and his con
duct while its counsel and afterwards
were defended today by his law part
ner, Edward F. McOIennen of Boston,
before the senate sub-committee in
vestigating Mr. Brandeis" fitness to be
a supreme court justice.
McClennen's testimony dealt chiefly
with Brandeis' resignation from the
company's directorate in 1906, the re
tention in 1911 of the Brandeis firm as
counsel for shoe manufacturers who
sought to obtain machinery free from
conditions imposed by the company's
leases and the publication of an
opinion given in 1910 by the Bmndels
firm, that the lenses were invalid un
der the anti-trust law.
The opinion. MbClennen said, was
not Intended for publication, but was
jiven to Charles H. Jones, a shoe man
ufacturer who came to the Brandeis
firm and wanted to know if, in view
of tl'e company's leases, he could safe
ly acquire some machines recently de
veloped. He was told that he could, as
the firm believed the leases wore in
valid. That opinion. McOIennen
said, was based on the supreme court's
decision in the Wall paper case. Jones
showed the opinion to the manufac
turer of the new macihines and the
manufacturer published it as an ad
vertisement. Brandeis resicrned from the com
pany's board of directors, the witness
declared because he could not. brin:?
about the correction of certain fea
tures of the lenses which he rccrarded
as objectionable and for which he felt
he was in a measure responsible so
loner as he remained a director.
The employment of the Brandeis
firm by shoe manufacturers fighting
the machinery company, five years
after Brandeis had resigned, was ex
plained by McClennen. He said the
manufacturers paid the firm $2,600 and
hat Brandeis paid back that amount
from his own personal funds.
Stephen S. Gregory of Chicago
former president of the American Bar
association, testified that Brandeis
eputntior. throughout the country was
oxeellent as to both ability and char
acter. The hearing will be continu
ed tomorrow.

RECEIVED NOTABLE TRIBUTE
During Session of British Chamber of
Commerce.
London, March 1, 6.20 p. m. The
American consular system received a
notable tribute today during the dis
cussion by the British Chamber of
Commerce of the improvement of the
British consular service. President
Sterling of the Belfast delegation, who
is one or tne largest linen Droducers
in Great Britain, said that whenever
be required, exact technicle details con
cerning linen, Belfast s chief industry,
he was obliged to seek in in the
American consular reports, which con
tained better information concerning
linen than the British government or
the Belfast trade possessed.
A Sheffield delegate, representing
one of the great steel industries, said
this factory was compelled to use a
rare mineral alloy in the production
or essential war supplies and that it
was unable to learn about the alloy
until it obtained complete details from
American consular reports. The pres
ent extensive branch of this large war
industry, he added, was entirely the
result of American reports. A reso
lution was introduced at the meeting
tor the reorganization or the British
consular service with British-born
consuls. One of the delegates assert
ed that during the competition for
trade between Great Britain and Ger
many preceding the war, 44 British
consuls were Germans.

Broker Lyman
Back in New York
CLAIMS FIRM OF J. H. PUTNAM
& CO IS SOLVENT
WIFE ACCOMPANIED HIM
Declares Persons Who Sent Money to
Him Were of More Than Average
Intelligence Would Have Made
More by Dealing -Straight.
New York, March 1. John Grant
Lyman, who was arrested several days
ago at St. Petersburg, Fla., where he
fled from this city Feb. 8, after the
discovery of an alleged oil stock swin
dle said to have netted him more than
$30,000, was returned here tonight in
the custody of government agents.
Deputy United States Marshall W. D.
Vlnzant of Florida, who accompanied
the party, declared Lyman, confided in
him on the way here that if he could
have operated six weeks later as
"John H. Putnam & Co." he would
have "cleaned up a million dollars."
Dupes of More Than Average Intelli
gence. Lyman, who it is believed, was about
to leave for Spanish Honduras on a
motor boat when he was apprehended,
boasted that persons throughout the
country who sent their money to him
for investment were above the average
in intelligence and that "it was
pleasure to him to know that he got
the best of them," according to Vin
zant. Lyman was locked up in the
lomos on his arrival here.
Will be Arraigned Today.
He will be arraigned tomorrow in
the federal court on an indictment
charging him with illegally using the
mails. His wife accompanied him
here from Philadelphia, where she
went earlier in the day. She was per
mitted to sit with him during the two
hour journey.
Lyman is quoted as stating that his
disappearance from New York was
not due to postoffice inspectors inves
tigation of Putnam & Co., but to the
ract tnat Uorham Tufts of Los An
geles, who was on his bond of $20,000
when he tied from the California city
two years ago after being convicted
there in a land fraud, was on his track
and secret service men were trailing
a cnautreur formerly in his employ in
nope or learning nis whereabouts.
Protests Company is Solvent.
Postoffice Inspectors who went to
Florida to get the fugitive say he
protested to them that Putnam & Co.
was "solvent" and that he would
make a fight to oust the receiver. He
also told them, they said, that once
when He was an honest broker" b!
was cleaned out of a fortune of $300.
000. He then became "a sort of get
rich -quick operator" they said he
boasted of having reaped a "soft
graft ' last year promoting premium
Donas in swltzerand.
Would H ave Made More by Being
Straight.
Vinzant asserted tonight that Ly
man told him if Putnam & Co., had
invested the money entrusted to the
firm during "the boom" which it ere
ated in oil stocks. Lyman would have
realized a great deal more money.
$20,000 in Bills Taken From Him.
The prisoner complained that $8v000
in bills of $1,000 each was taken trom
him by the arresting officers in Flori
da and has not since been accounted
for. Fifteen thousand dollars in cur
rency and one hundred shares of Steel
stock, which captors say they found
on his person have been forwarded
here from Florida, it was announced.
$10,000 in Philadelphia for Wife.
Lyman, who journeyed most of the
way to Florida by automobile after
his disappearance from Xew York
says he deposited $10,000 in a Philadel
phia bank to his wife's credit. She
failed to get It, he said, because she
did not correctly interpret a code mes
sage he sent to her.
OPPOSITION TO NEW HAVEN
CONTROL OF SOUND LINES
Made by Whitfield Tuck on Behalf of
the People's Service League.
Boston, March 1. Opposition to the
petition of the Jew York, iMew Haven
and Hartford Railroad for permission
to continue control of Its Sound lines
was voiced at the Interstate Com
merce Commission's hearing today by
Whitfield Tuck of Winchester, a for
mer representative in the legislature.
He appeared in behalf of the People's
Servihe League, of which he is sec
retary and advocated separation of
the railroad from its steamship lines
on the ground that it would tend to
do away with monopoly.
The witness questioned the proprie
ty of the appearance yesterday; of
Chairman Frederick MacLeod of the
publio service commission in favor of
railroad control of the properties. Such
an attitude, he said, was not to be ex
pected from a man who a few years
ago was state chairman of the demo
cratic party which, at its last na
tional convention had declared mo
nopoly "Indenfensible and intolerable."
DENIAL TH'AT ALL BRITISH
MERCHANT SHIPS ARE ARMED
Made by Sir Edward Grey, Secretary
for Foreign Affairs.
London, March 1, 8.14 p. m. Sir Ed
ward Grey, secretary, for foreign af
fairs, authorizes for publication the
following statement:
"The assumption apparently made
by the German government that all
British merchant ships are armed is
entirely incorrect. Practically all
British merchant ships employed in
trade between the United Statesh of
America and the United Kingdom
have hitherto been unarmed.
"The claim, therefore, made by the
German g-overnment to sink all their
merchant ships at sight because of
their amament is -one which cannot
possibly be Justified. This is clearly
proved by the - statement issued last
night giving a list of British and neu
tral unarmed merchant ships which
have been tonpedoed by German sub
marines without warning."

His Renomination and Re-election Dealt Solely With
National and International Issues -Futile Attempt' Was
Made to Get Syracuse Convention to Insert in Platform

Syracuse. N. Y.. March 1. In key-tlve
note speech and platform, democrats
or isew York state assembled in in
formal convention, tonight ratified the
administration of President Wilson and
took steps to bring about his re-election.
Harmony marked the conven
tion's deliberations, every proposal
being adopted unanimusly.
The follownig delegates at large to
the national democratic convention at
St. Louis were recommended for the
suppor of the party voters at the
spring primaries:

PRESIDENT WILSON DEMANDS
RECORD VOTE IN CONGRESS
On Resolutions to Warn Americans Off
Armed Ships.
Washington, March 1. President
Wilson served notice on congress to
night that he will consent to nothing
less than a record vote on the anti
administration resolutions to warn
Americans off armed ships of European
belligerents before he goes on with the
German submarine negotiations.
No compromise proposition, such as
a vote of confidence in the president's
foreign policy, will be acceptable. Such
an action, it is held, might be con
strued in Berlin as Justifying the opin
ion that the president lacks the sup
port of congr-ess and nis own party In
his demands for a full observance of
international law, while its only pur
pose would be to afford members of
congress in a way to avoid recording
their positions before the country on
the straight, out-and-out question.
President Wilson made his position
clear to congressional leaders tonight
In -unequivocal terms as the climax to
a day of confusion, uncertainty and po
litical manoeuvering that marked the
opening of his first real ght with con
gress. As if to emphasize that the presi
dent absolutely refuses to continue the
negotiations with Germany until the
attitude of congress Is settled, it was
made known that the United States
does not consider the latest assur
ances from Count Von Bernstorff, the
German ambassador, as broad or as
satisfactory as those originally given.
EXCESSIVE WATERING
OF OYSTERS DISCLOSED
By Inspectors of State Dairy and Food
Department.
Hartford. Conn., Marcti 1. Samples
of oysters recently taken at 13 dif
ferent points in the state toy inspectors
of the state dairy and food department
disclosed excessive addition of water
in 30 per cent, of the cases, according
to an announcement today. A state
ment from the dairy and food com
missioner's office dealing with the dis
closure says:
"At hearings held regarding this sit
uation it developed that in some in
stances as much as 25 per cent, of
water had been added to the oysters.
Inasmuch as the drinking by oysters
has been a trade practice extending
over an Indefinite period, and of a
varying time for drinking, it was de
cided not to prosecute any of the cases
involved from this preliminary survey.
Hereafter, however, all cases of un
necessary or excessive watering of
oysters will be brought to the attention
of tne courts."

urged his re-nomination and re

solely with national and international
issues.
A futile attempt was made -fey advo
cates of equal suffrage to insert in the
platform pledging th9 party to the af
firmative side of the woman suffrage)
question. Mrs. Inez Milholland Bols
sevant and Mrs. Mary Baird of New
York headed a delegation that peti
tioned the resolutions to go on record

ment. Miss Harriet May Mills, repre
senting Mrs. Norman De Whitehous

tended to define the party's position
on any matters of state policy.
