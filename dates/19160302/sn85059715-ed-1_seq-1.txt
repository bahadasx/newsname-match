( r ACKOCIATIO PRC**!
PAiRfS, March 2.?The press and.
public of Prance are myBtifled at the
continued pause in the German attack
around Verdun. Caution born of experience
leads generally to the rcjec- /
tlon of the view that the Germans have
given up all hope of trying to capture
the Lorraine fortress. It is thought
more likely they are merely resting
before starting afresh with greater
energy. j
It Is believed in many quarters that r
the attack on Verdun was only a pre- t
limitary to operations on a much t
larger scale for the purpose of trying ^
to crush tho French once and for ail. B
However, that may be, it is affirmed, *
that General .loffre is fully prepared for
all eventualities. So Tar only the
local French reserves have been called 8
upon at Verdun, the great general re- 8
serve forces remaining Intact for use c
In repelling over-heavy onslaughts or B
carrying out a great counter attack
when the opportune moment comes. "
The question is raised as to whether ?
the next German attack will again be ^
at Verdun or along the front from the I v
Somme to the Aisne, as It Is known)
tnat tne uernians navo Deen m&Ktng
a preparations along the latter line, the.
aouthern limit of which is many miles!
nearer to Paris than is Verdun. These:
preparations, however, arc not so|i
elaborate as those which J>ad been ''
made for Verdun.
On the other hand if the Germans
* continue their assaults againBt Verdun j
from the plain of the Woevre there|
infantry will have to attach unsupport- c
ed by tbe heaviest German guns, it is j
agreed, as the water-soaked cl&y soil i *
of the Lorraine plain makes the trans- j j
port of such guns almost Impossible. 11
The plain Is only crossed by four mill-; B
tary roads and troops and light artil-! a
lery would be obliged to deploy in the | c
open under Are from the French posl-it
tlons on the heights of the -.Mcuse.
Two valleys lead to Verdun from i
the plain. Both are blocked by FortB p
Dcs TavenneR and Rozelller, and f
everywhere else the Infantry would t
face thickly wooded heights with a t
straight drop of 250 feet. The Gcr- \
mans would have here, however, all s
the resources of Metz within easy c
reach. c

Ira E. Robinson is the only Repub- c

would be sure to carry Nicholas coun- e
ty in the general election, according r
to J. J. Dotson. of Rlchwood, editor t
of the Nicholas Republican, who Is a 'T

"The judge will poll seventy-five
per cent of the vote of the county In fi
the primary, and if nominated? j
-which it seems certain he will he? l
will receive a substantial majority at
the hands of the voters next fall. He
has many admirers and' warm supporters
among the Democrats of our
district and will draw a large vote
from them in the general election. /
The Democratic politicians .realise
that and consequently are doing 'every
thing in their power to thwart <his
nomination. They are, in common
with their henchmen and the Democratic
newspapers in other parts of )
the state, moving heaven and earth j
to boost General Lilly's campaign, t
They believe they have nothing ,to y
fear from the general but know they |
have nothing to hope for if the judge c
secures the nomination. c

At the time of Nusbaum's convlclon

s.w requiring the labeling of all inoxicating

he case to the supreme court, a

The time in which the appeal

ase a pardon 1b refused, It is proba le
that the case will go on to the

In case Governor Hatfield should
ee fit to grant the pardon asked for,
urther legal proceedings would not

would probably not be as satsfactory

Next Tuesday.
INDIANAPOLIS, March 2.?That
the eUte wide primary, to he held in
Indiana March 7, 1b going to be an.
expensive proposition both to taxpayers
and candidates for office Is the
opinion of political leaders of ail parties.
There is much speculation as
to what It will cost the state and
these estimates vary, but no oStlmate
has been lower than an average of
$5,000 a county. The lowest estimate,
therefore, Is $460,000 for the ninety-two
counties, of: the state. Some
politicians think the cost will run to
$600,000. !
Marlon county, in which Indianapo- j
lis is situated, has already appro-:;
prlated $84,000 to pay the expenses I
of the primary. Some county officials
say this will not be enough. Some of
the smaller counties may.not iiave to
spend, It lis estimated more than
$3,000. But the larger counties like
Lake, Vigo. St; Joseph, Allen and
Vanderburg, and perhaps a few others
