CONGRESS IN
UPROAR OVER
POLICY MOVE
Demands of Wilson in the
Armed Ship Question
Causes Upheaval.
STIRRING TALKS MADE
Congressmen Rally to Sup
port of President and Bat
ter Down "Antis."
Washington, March 2. The armed
ship issue suddenly blazed up in the
senate today with the most sensational
debate of the session In which Senator
Gore, democrat, and author of a reso
lution to -warn Americans off bellig
erent vessels, repeated what he char
acterized as a report that President
Wilson had told certain congress lead
ers that war between the United States
and Germany "might not be ungrate
ful and might result In advancing civ
ilization by bringing about the end of
the European war by midsummer."
Chairman Stone of the foreign re
lations committee twice emphatically
denied that the president ever had
expressed any such sentiment in his
hearing, and Senator James, another
administration leader, demanded to
know why Senator Gore had not
sought to confirm the report from the
president himself.
Had Hoped Report Untrue.
Senator Gore responded that he had
hoped the report was untrue; that he
had repeated it only as a report sur
rounded by circumstances which gave
it credence in his opinion, but that he
was glad to hear it denied.
cThe storm broke in the senate when.
Senator Stone, announcing that he
was not in accord with the president's
demand for a defeat of the armed ship
resolutions, proposed a means to let
the Gore resolution come to a vote
and Senator James announced that
the administration forces had the votes
to defeat it.
Senator Williams of Mississippi
spoke in support of the president, as
did Senator Lodge, the ranking repub
lican of the foreign relations commit
tee. The debate ended without action
and the senate passed to other busi
ness with the prospect of taking up the
Gore resolution tomorrow.
Meanwhile the situation in the house
was unchanged, with the administra
tion leaders apparently making no
headway toward a vote there.
Stone's View of Situation.
"I deBire to state the international
situation as I understand it," said
Senator Stone.
"A sharp issue has been defined be
tween Germany and Great Britain as
to the Ftatus of armed merchantmen.
Germany contends that armed mer
chant vessels are the equivalent of
auxiliary war vessels and has an
nounced her policy to be, that after
March 1 armed merchantmen would be
regarded as warships and subject to
the rules of war.
"On the other hand Great Britain
contends that under international law
merchantmen have the right to be
armed for defensive purposes and that
armed merchantmen are entitled under
the law to the same immunity as un
armed ships, without regard to cargo.
She has announced her intention to
carry out that policy.
".Vow, where does the United States
come in? In this way. If both persist
in these courses, neither yielding to
each other, nor to the importunities of
neutral nations and if Germany at
tacks an armed merchantman and any
American citizen is injured, the ques
tion is presented to this government
what our attitude would be. If no
American citizens were on board we
would have no cause to interfere, un
less we proceeded on the altruistic
theory of obligations to humanity."
Should Wear Hearts on Sieves.
"This emergency is of high impor
tance. The president, senators and
representatives should speak with
each other and with the country, free
from political bias. We should wear

THE WAR
TODAY
After a lnll in Infantry opera
tions In the vicinity of Verdun
since the early part of the week
there has been a resumption of the
German offensive in the Woevre
region. A violent bombardment
was followed by a spirited attack
on the French at Fresnes, 10 miles
southeast of Verdun. Paris re
ports the driving ont of the Ger
mans from the few positions
vrhich they succeeded in penetrat
ing in their assault.
The new attack gives color to
what seems to be the prevailing
military opinion in Paris that the
German offensive at Terdun had
merely halted.
From Dutch sources come re
ports that the German drive is (o
be resumed from the northeast,
9(1,000 men having been concen
trated near Bnzy, behind Fort
Vans, which is said to have been
destroyed by the German heavy
mortars.
Estimates of the German losses
In the offensive are running high
In entente quarters, one from
Paris placing them at between
125,000 and 130,000. All accounts
from German sonrces, however,
have declared that the casualties
of the attacking armies were sur
prisingly small.
The German plan of campaign
has been primarily based on the
bombardment of sectors they de
sire to attain, according to unoffi
cial Information from Berlin and
it Is possible they are now bring
ing np their heavy grins to cap
tured positions with the object of
shelling points nearer Verdun.
To the east and southeast of
Verdun fighting Is still in progress
but on a smaller scale than for
several days.
The British front has been
stretched between thirty and forty
miles down to the region of
Amiens, In order to release French
troops for the defense of Verdun.
Progress of the new German
submarine campaign, which was

of allied merchantmen. The loss
of one vessel, the Russian steamer

her crew having been drowned.
A German seaplane dropped
bombs on the southeast coast of
England last night and killed one
child. Xo serious property damage
resulted.
Emperor William has left the
Verdun front and returned to Ger

dispatch.
On the Rnssian, Italian and Cau
casus fronts no important changes
have been reported.
President "Wilson is determined
to force a vote in congress on the
resolutions warning Americans off
armed ships of belligerent nations
and refuses to continue negotia

TEUT RAIDER
IS REPORTED
AS CAPTURED
Famous German Auxiliary
Cruiser Moewe Taken by
British Warships.
IS CAPTOR OF APPAM
Vessel Said to Be Caught
Now Believed Same That
Overpowered Liner.
Buenos Aires, March 2. Press dis
patches from Montevideo say that a
steamer arriving from Europe inter
cepted near the coast of Brazil, a wire
less message stating that British
cruisers had captured the German
auxiliary cruiser Moewe.
The Moewe, it is said, was taken by
the British cruisers to the island of
Trinidad.
The American steamer Santa Bar
bara has arrived at Montevideo, her
captain making the announcement
that a French cruiser which put out
from Dakar, on the west coast of
Africa, encountered a German raid
er, name not given, and opened Are
on her. Under cover of darkness the
German ship got away. She was, how
ever, damaged on her upper works by
the French Are. There is some doubt,
however, as to the identity of the
German vessel reported to have been
captured. Another version of the ac
count is that the vessel in question is
the German cruiser Roon.
Has Gained Much Fame.
The Moewe first came into prom
inence with the arrival at Hampton
Roads several weeks ago of the Brit-
German prize crew. She brought word
of a mysterious German commerce
raider, the Moewe, which was roam
ing the seas and had captured and
sunk seven British merchantmen and
admiralty transports in addition to
capturing the Appam.
Dispatches from the Canary islands
late last month reported the arrival
of the British steamer Westburn with
a German prize crew on board, said
to be from the Moewe. According to
these reports the ! Moewe, continuing
her activities after capture of the Ap
pam, and the seven other British
vessels, betyeen Jan. 16 and Feb. 9
sank five British steamers off the
coast of Brazil.
Sought By British,
i A vigorous search for the Moewe
was begun by the British admiralty.
The Moewe was reported to be a
tramp steamship fitted with guns for
preying on commerce of the entente
allies.
The German cruiser Roon was said
to have escorted the Moewe when the
latter captured the Appam. A report
that the Roon had been captured by
the British cruiser Drake off Ber
muda was published last month, but
subsequently was denied.
The Island of Trinidad Is one of
the British West Indies, lying off the
coast of Venezuela.
Admit Moewe is Disguised.
Amsterdam, (via London, March 2,
6:24 a. m.) Captain Persius, naval
expert of the Berliner Tageblatt, dis
cussing in that newspaper the new
German campaign against merchant
shipping, makes the assertion that it
will be carried out, not so much
through the medium of submarines
whose activities are hampered by dip
lomatic difficulties, as through dis
guised commerce raiders like the
Moewe, which has already sunk a
number of vessels of the allies and
which sent the Appam to Newport
News with a prize crew.
REFUSES USE OF HIS
NAME IN ILLINOIS
New York, March 2. Theodore
Roosevelt's determination not to al
low the use of his name as a candidate
for the presidential nomination in the
spring primary elections was empha
sized today by the announcement that
his secretary, John W. McGrath, has
directed the withdrawal of Mr. Roose
velt's name from the Illinois primaries,
Springfield, 111., March 2. Secre
tary of State Lewis G. Stevenson said
today he had not received a reply to
his letter to Colonel Theodore Roose
velt in which he asked if it was the
intention of the colonel to permit the
use of his name as a presidential
candidate In the spring primary. "I
hardly expect a reply before tomor
row," said Mr. Stevenson.
Eighteen Vets Die in Month.
Springfield, HI., March 2. Eighteen
veterans of the Civil war died at the
Illinois Soldiers' and Sailors' home at
Qulncy, 111., during the month of Feb
ruary, according to a report made pub

IS CONFIDENT OF
FRENCH FORCES
President of Chamber of Commerce of
Verdun Feels Safe from Teu
tons' A (tal k.
Paris, Feb. 29. (Delayed.) M. Cou
ten, president cf the Chamber of Com
merce of Verdun, who has arrived in
Paris, says that when the civilian pop
ulation was ordered to leave the city
last Friday they were satisfied that
the enemy's offensive was already
checked.
"I had been able to see all the de
fensive precautions which were tak
en," added M. Couten, "and was aware
of the strength of the forces accum
ulated in the' Verdun sector and my
confidence is consequently absolute in
the complete early success of our
arms. The importance of the German
gain should not be exaggerated. I
know all the points where the first
phases of the battle occurred and can
say that the exact advance of the Ger
mans north of Verdun does not exceed
four kilometres."
Other refugees who have been in
terviewed agree in stating that, despite
the terrific noise of the artillery fire
and the lurid illumination of the sky
during Friday night and Saturday
morning when they left, all were su
premely confident in the superiority
of their own army. They say that the
only civilian left in Verdun on Satur
day was an employe of the city hall.
The last refugees were escorted by
city firemen who, with admirable de
votion, aided the tired mothers to
carry their children. The only sign of
worry or exasperation shown by the
retreating residents of Verdun was
when the customs employes inquired
regarding the contents of their pack
ages.
The refugees were greatly touched
by the reception accorded to them or
their arrival at the railroad station in
Paris when a number of persons, in
cluding society women, offered to
carry their baggage and help them to
places of shelter. The general optim
ism was reflected by the remark of one
young man, who, when asked about the
occurrences in the fortress city, re
plied: "They have broken our win
dows but we shall return there soon
with glaziers."
