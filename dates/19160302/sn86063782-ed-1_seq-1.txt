Amsterdam, Holland, Feb. 20 <via
London.)?The Frankfurter Zeitung
publishes an interview on submarine
Warfare credited to a high naval of.
flclal whose views, in substance, fol
low:
"A majority of German naval of?
fleers believe that a complete breach
would be conducive to a far earliei
victorious termination of the war, but
only if Germany derived all the results
logically arising out of such a
breach. As soon^as Germany was in
such a position that she need have
no more consideration for America
she should declare all Great Britain
blockaded and announce that every
ship of whatever flag which attempt
ed to enter a British port would be
regarded as a blockade runner and
destroy it without warning.
"This policy would -lead . to the
starvation of Britain and thus to.hei
submission and then automatically the
submission of Russia and France.
America then would be Isolated and
would have to submit because Ger
many having obtained all the entente
battleships and submarines would be
far stronger 'on the sea than America.
"America, when defeated, would
have to surrender all German mer
chant ships which she had seized and
also to pay all war costs of the cen
tral powers and their allies."

r Washington,^ Feb. 26.?The military
committee late today voted for a regular
standing army of 187,000 men,

the vote.
Voting in the committee began at a
proposal for 220,000 men. ' The number
was gradually scaled dwon until
a proposal for 150,000 men was beaten
by one vote. Then the Republicans
and three Democrats put through
the provision as it was dually accepted
by the committee to be incorporated
in the bill to be presented to tht
House.
The War Department's estiuiute oi
additional officers for the regular army
also was increased from 780 to
1,000.
The section for reorganizing the National
Guard was framed to provide
for a maximum strength of 424,000
men, at which 50 per cent must be recruited
within two years.
The Senate committee has practlcally
agreed on a provision for several
summer student encampments at the
discretion of the President Those
who take the instruction would be
mustered into a special federal re seryp,
pledging themselves to serve
the country is needed, but being quite
apart from the regular army service
or the National Quard. The plan resembles
the continental army scheme
somewhat.
. WHY PRINCE ALBERT WINS
Patented Process Is Responsible for
Its International Popularity
Smokers so much appreciate the
flavor and coolness and aroma of
Prince Albert pipe and cigarette tobacco
that they often marvel that this
one brand could be so different from
all others.
The answer to this question is to bo
found (Ml thfi rpvpra*? olilo """""
? WW u.uv XJM. W*Cl Jf
Prince Albert package, where you will
read: "Process Patented July 30th,
1907." That tells the whole story.
Prince Albert is made by a patented
process that cuts out the bite and
parch, which makes the tobacco so
mighty agreeable and satisfying to mei
of every taste of every civilized nation
on the globe.
Smokers should (realize that this
patented process cost three years' continous
work and study and a fortune
In money to perfect But the result
has proven to be worth all that was
expended upon it, believed they nevei
could enjoy a pipe or a makin'e
cigarette.
Prince Albert makes it possible foi
every man to smoke a pipe or to roll
his own cigarettes. A"nd, no matter
how tender the tongue, Prince Albert
cannot bite or parch. That is cut out
by the patented process, leaving foi
the smoker only the Joys of the fragrant
tobacco.
it is a fact that since Prince Albert
"arrived," Just about six years ago,
it has made three men smoke plpei
tgrhere one smoked a pipe before!
