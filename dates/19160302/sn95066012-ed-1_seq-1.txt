Supreme Go.i t Decides in Favor of
Delinquent Taxpayets
Am GEN. BARBER REVERSED
Opinion of Full Bench in Mandamus
Proceedings Brought By Brook
field Voter.
Montpelier, March 1. The payment
or non-payment of taxes is not a
qualiflcation for voting on questions
of state-wide importance In Vermont.
The constitutional rights of the citiz
ens to exercise the right of suffrage, re
gardless what the Legislature may do
In the way of enacting laws to the
contrary, are safeguarded in a decis
ion handed down late this evening by
the Vermont Supreme court. The de
cision, prepared by Justice John M.
Watson, Is concurred in by the full
bench.
Thomas Martin, who had not paid
his taxes on February 15 of the pres
ent year, petitioned the Supreme court
to issue a writ of mandamus to com
pel the Board of Civil Authority In the
town of Brookfleld to put his name on
the check list. The board had been
guided by an act of the Legislature
which would disfranchise delinquent
tax-payers.
In a letter to Secretary of State Guy
W, Bailey, two days too late to per
mit voters to take advantage of the
opinion, Attorney General Herbert G.
Barber of Brattleboro held tbat failure
to pay taxes on or before February 15
disfranchised voters.
The Board of Civil Authority in this
city went on record as disregarding
the opinion of the attorney general
and the boards in other places an
nounced that non-payment; of t .taxes
would not disfranchise a voter from ex
pressing bis opinion, through, the; bal
lot, oh the two state-wide, referejidutus
to be. voted upon. next Tuesday,-the
Perry' prohibitory, act;and. the .direqt
prmary ..measure. iVlU .yyiu
A special session of the , Supreme
court -was convened Monday , and argu
ments, were made for and against the
petition of the Brookfleld man f who
demanded that he be allowed to vote
notwithstanding that he" was a delin
quent taxpayer .

YOUNG THIEVES CAUGHT
Five Boys Arraigned Before Municipal
Judge E. H. Holden.
Following a clue developed from the
last of several breaks at the I. E. Gib
son grocery store, Officers Hurley and
Brazil Wednesday rounded up five boys
between 12 and 14 years of age and
brought the culprits before Judge Hol
den of the municipal court. Several
of the boy's parents were also before
the court.
Little difficult was experienced in
obtaining confessions from the boys
who it was learned have guilty of a
number of petty burglaries committed
during the past few months. There
have been several breaks, some which
failed, at the I. E. Gibson store and al
so attempts to enter the Bottom gro
cery on Main street and the Houran
grocery. The boys admitted that some
of them were responsible for the break
at ihe Morrisey grocery at the cornor
of Pleasant and North streets.
41 least ralf a dozen of the- resi
dences of summer visitors at Old Ben
nington, which have been closed for
the winter, have been entered and in
eaclljcase the break was admitted to
havejbeen the work of some of the five
in cojurt or other boys who have been
associated with them in their pilfering.
Th4 value of the property stolen by
the boys is not large and not much
damage resulted to the buildings and
residences. A watch Is missing from
one of the summer residences but It is
expected that It will soon be recover
ed by the officers. They have in their
possession a small box of coins which
they will return to the owner upon ap
plication. The officers are convinced that at
least 18 different boys have been im
plicated in the different breaks and it
is probable there will be another hear
ing before the court either today or in
the near future. . ; . ' ;
The boys arraigned before Judge
Holden were iplaced on probation and
fined $15 each, They must earn the
money and pay',it to .the probatlpn offi
cer before May . The boys must also
off the streets at plght and in case any
one of them violates his parole he, will
be sent to the industrial school. Only
their age saved them from the inflic
tion of a severe penalty. Had any one
of them passed the age of 1G he would
have been likely to have received a
term in the state prison at Windsor..
Not a little credit for the breaking
up of tnerSystem' df peffy thieving is
duo officers Brazil and Hurley. Tliey
have been at worlr on. itlit ''cases fpr

Several Hundred Germans Reported
to Be Cut Off in Ruined (

. London, March 2. The Germans in
the battles wept region of Verdun con
tinue their bombardments west of the
Meuse, in the region between Malan-
court and Forges, across the river east
ward about Vaux and - Damloup and
against . French trenches in the
Woevre region, southeast of Verdun.
But their big offensive, so far as in
fantry attacks are, concerned, has
ceased, at least for the moment No
hint as to whether it will begin again
or whether the Germans will rest con
tent with the points of vantage they
have gained is given In the official re
ports from cither Berlin or Paris.
Unofficial advices from Berlin
have stated that the German plan of
campaign has been primarily based on
the bombardment of sections they de
sire to attain, and it Is possible that
they may now be drawing up their
big guns to captured pasitlons, with
the object of shelling points neftrer

French troops still surround the ruined-fort
ot Douaumont, in which sever
al hundred Germans are cut off. The
line from Douaumont to Cote de
Polvre has been more solidly fortified
and is now in a condition to resist the
most violent attacks. The bend made
by the Meuse north of Verdun Is
swept by both the German and the
French artillery and is untenable for
either side.
In Champagne, the Havas agency
adds, the attack which it was be

It would be risky at present to say
whether the pauso is due to the fact
that the Germans realize that all ef
forts to take Verdun are vain and are
simply confining themselves to defend
ing positions which they have so dear

troops are merely in need of a rest
before being hurled forward again
to the assault, but , the Havas agency
says, the German intentions will be

BACKING UP WILSON
New
York Democratic Convention
Support President
Syracuse, March 2. In keynote
speech and platform, democrats of
New York state, assembled in inform
al convention here last night ratified
,the administration of President Wil
son and took steps to bring sabout bis
re-election. Harmony marked the con
vention's, deliberations, every propos
al being adopted unanimously.
The following delegates at Urge to
the national democratic convention at
St, Louis were recommended for the
support of the, party voters at the
eprlng primaries: United -States Sen
a tor James. ; A. O'Oormap, William
Churcb Osborn, chairman of the demo
cratic state committee; .'George J.
Meyer of Buffalo, a German-American
supporter of the president, and Sam
uel Untermyer, a New York lawyer.
The delegates to the national conten
tion, who comprise New York's ''Big
Four," were unpledged but were nomi
nated with the understanding tbat
they are to work for a second term for
Mr. Wilson.
The keynote speech, delivered by
former Gov. Martin II. Glynn as -permanent
chairman, aroused much en
thusiasm. In addition to commend
ing the actions of Mr. Wilson during
his, occupancy of the national execu
tive chair, it replied directly to the
tlclsms of the president and bis
it reign policies made by former Sena-
br Elihu Root a't the recent republl
an state convention in New York.

CONGRESSTilUSTGO
ON RECORD, SAYS
No Compromise Vote Will Be Ac
ceptable to Wilson
LINES MUST BE DEFINED
Negotiations with Germany Suspend-
ed Until President Knows Where
Congress Stands.
Washington, ' March 1. President
Wilson served notice on congress to
night that he will Consent to nothing
less than a record vote on the anti-
administration resolutions to warn
Americans oft armed ships of Euro
pean belligerents before he goes on
with the German submarien negotia
tions. I
No compromise, such as a vote et
confidence in the President's foreign
policy, will be acceptable. Such an
action, it is held, might be construed
in Berlin as justifying the opinion
that the President lacks the support
of congress and his own party in his
demands for a full observance of in
ternational law, while its only pur
pose would be to afford members of
congress a way to avoid recording
their positions before the country on
the out-and-out question.
President Wilson made his position
clear to congressional leaders tonight
In unequivocal termB as the climax to
a day of confusion, uncertainty and po
litical maneuvering that marked . the
opening of his first real fight with con
gress. As If to emphasize that, the Presi
dent absolutely refuses to continue
the negotiations with Germany until
the. attitude of coneress is settled., it
