PARTY OWNED PAPER
NOT PROVEN SUCCESS
At the North Dakota Socialist state
convention held Feb. 4-6, 1916, it was
decided by unanimous vote that the
state-owned paper, The Iconoclast, be
turned over to a new association.
This course was taken, not because
there was any discord but because it
has not proven-a success, as the reso
lution herewith printed says.
The delegates in taking this course
showed their appreciation of the new
scheme by pledging some $500 to it.
The convention lasted three days
and was enthusiastic throughout. A
new platform was adopted and a state
ticket elected. The ticket is satisfac
tory to every Socialist. The question
of the Non-Partizan League was dis
cussed pro and con and the conven
tion decoded to allow the members to
join if they have a mind to. The
league is not a political party.
The party expects to put up a rec
ord-breaking campaign.
The following resolution in regard
to the paper was adopted:
Whereas, The experience of the
Iconoclast as a party-owned paper
has not proven a success, and
Whereas, The information before
this convention is conclusive that the
paper can no longer continue under
the present plan of ownership, and j
Whereas, We recognize the import- ,
ance of the state of North Dakota
having a Socialist press,
Therefore, Be It Resolved, That the [
state committee be instructed to en- i
courage the organization of a co-op
erative association and as soon as
feajable transfer its present contract
with the former owners to the new
association.
Adopted by the convention in ses
gion on Feb. 6th, 1916.

THE SOCIALIST PARTY
I am bold enough to believe that
any honest investigator will tgTM
with me (hat cnpitanHiu In a mere
temporary makeshift, anil thai Social
ism is to bo Its natural, necessary and
inevitable successor.
If I am correct in tills diagnosis of
tin- Itata of your mind 1 have one
BOM important word to say to you
by way of conclusion.
Read the fundamental Socialist
works and join the Socialist party or
ganization. It is of supreme Import
ance that every Socialist should be
thoroughly grounded In the fundamen
tal principles of scientific Socialism.
It Is likewise of supreme Importance
that every Socialist should co-operate
with every other active Socialist by
joining the Socialist party organiza
tion.
The Socialist party has started out
upon its career with a full knowledge
of Its high mission. The time has
come in the history of the world for
conscious evolution. We Socialists
know full well that the economic laws
compel the abolition of capitalism and
the introduction of Socialism. And
we have deliberately organized the
Socialist party in order to make the
transition from capitalism to Social
ism as smooth and easy and rapid as
possible.
In order to do this successfully it
is necessary for us to remove econom
ic bewilderment from the minds of
the people and put the clear, simple
truth in its place. It is necessary for
us to send speakers to every corner
of the land. It is necessary for us to
put Socialist literature in the hands
of every adult in America. And it Is
necessary to keep on doing this un
til the object is accomplished.
To do this requires close and syste
matic organization, ramifying into ev
ery locality in the country.
The Socialist party is, therefore, a
compact, dues-paying organization,
like a trade union. The dues bring in
a regular fund with which to carry
on the work.
The importance of systematic and
effective organization cannot be over
estimated.
It was the effort put forth by the
organized Socialists of America that
BAD EYESIGHT
MAKES CRIMINALS
NEW YORK.---Defective eyesight
frequently is the cause of criminal
tendencies or moral delinquencies, in
the opinion of William H. Wadhams,
judge of the court of general sessions.
"Bad eyes make bad men," said
Judge Wadhams, In an address to
the Society of Medical Jurisprudence.
"The man who cannot see straight
cannot think straight and cannot act
correctly. One of the^rst steps the
state should take in thr correction of
criminals is careful examination and
treatment of eyes."
Editor's Note. —The evil effects on
conduct of defective eyesight have
long ago been noted by ophthalmolo
gists. To acknowledge this source
of criminality in special cases is not
by any means to reject the economic
causes of crime, 90 per cent, of which
is due to poverty.

WHAT SOCIALISM WILL DO
By Robert Whitaker
Some advantages of Socialism may
be briefly summarized: Socialism
will increase the quantity of things.
It will organize and utilize the whole
labor force, and so vastly increase
production. Socialism will improve
the motives which make the cheap
manufactures, poor workmanship and
adulterations. Socialism will secure
the real utility of things. Use, not
exchange, will be the object of labor.
Things will be made to serve, not to
sell.
As to the relations of men: Social
ism will banish war: Private owner
snip is back of all sxi'e between men.
Socialism will purify .politics: Pri
vate capitalism is the great source of
political corrupation. Socialism will
make for real exchange: Competitive
exchange of stuffs hinders free ex
change of mind and soul.
Individually, Socialism will make
for education: Every man will have
opportunity to improve himself. So
cialism will make for invention and
discovery. Socialism will stimulate
the moral development of men. Men
will be no longer drudges, bread
slaves, hands, operatives, machines.
They will be truly lords of creation,
thinkers, characters. Crime will have
lost most of its motive, and pauper
ism will have no excuse.
The old partyites of Aberdeen are
putting up a big fight to oust the
three Socialists from the city coun
cil. One of the methods to be used is
to Introduce the commission form of
government. The same thing was
done in Everett to defeat the three
Socialist councilmen. Well, they may
decrease our representation on offi
cial bodies, but they cannot decrease
the Socialist vote and growth. We
have you on the run, Mr. Capitalist
Politician.

Civilization's Only Hope
By Charles Edward Russell
Author "The Uprising of the Many,"'
"Lawless Wealth," "Songs of De
mocracy," "Why I Am a Socialist,"
etc., etc.
Let the competitive system survive,
and whichever way the present war
rosults it will assuredly breed other
wars as gigantic or worse. From that
conclusion there is no logidal escape.
The same causes will produce same
results, always, automatically, irre
tflievably, as certain as night follows
day, as certain as the stars travel
their roads. No man may sow his
field with any faith that he can reap
it and no man can look forward to a
year of peace. So stands the terrible
fact that now confronts mankind.
We can shut it from our minds if we
are cowards, or try to forget it if we
are fools; but refute lit or deny it may
no man living.
Civilization's Only Hope
If then we are determined that
when this whirlwind of bestiality
shall have passed we shall not have
another, if we wish a condition un
der which the structure of society
shall not be blown down, human in
tercourse shall not he destroyed, civ
ilization shall not be set backward
and the earth shall not be bathed in
blood, the one possible way to that
condition is to elflminate forever the
causes of war.
Will Socialism Destroy
the Family?
By Meta L. Stern
You mSght as well face the fact,
dear reader, that Socialism will de
stroy the home and the family as
they exist today. But wait! Don't
condemn Socialism on a half truth,
hear the whole truth! You need not
fear for one minute that Socialism
will abolish any of those elements of
home life and family life that are
dear to your heart and mine. The
privacy that we all desire, the cher
ished intimacy with those we love,
the ever sacred and ever beautiful af
fection between husband and wife
and between parent and child. Social
ism will not and cannot destroy. The
very contrary is true. Economic se
curity, a larger freedom, and a more
general culture and refinement that
will come with Socialism will only
increase and cultivate the charm and
beauty of those ideals. The only
home that Socialism will destroy is
the home as a workshop. The only
family that Socialism will break up
is the family founded on the economic
dependence of women. Nor will this
break'ng-up process be achieved by
Socialism alone. Capitalism began it
more than a century ago, and is con
tinuing it at the present time in an
unbroken process of evolution. When
the first machinery for spanning and
SOCIALIST PRINCIPLES
A Socialist is one who places the
human rights of the many over
against the property rights of the
few.
Strictly speaking, there are no
"rights." There are merely needs, or
desires. When a number of human
beings recognize their common need
of a certain thing, they call it a "nat
tual right," or "God-given right."
Both are delusions. In practice, self
interest, backed by might, is the only
"right" recognized either by pagan or
Christian peoples. The present era
of anarchy and violence on the part
of the Christian moralists and "law
and order" hypocrites of the Old
World puts an end to all controversy
on this point. #
Jean Valjean entered the galleys
sobbing and shuddering, he went out
hardened; he entered in despair, he
went out sullen. What has been the
life of this soul? . . . It is an im
perative necessity that society should
look into these things; they are its
own works. —Les Miserablea.
Instead of business for private pro
fits we must have Business for the
Common Good. Instead of private
ownership of the means of life we
must have the means of life owned
by the public for the public welfare.
Instead of gigantic fortunes gathered
at the general expense and used for
individual power we must abolish
poverty, and give to the poorest child
in the land all the education that can
now be secured by the richest.
Instead of outworn feudalism we
must have all the full measure of
democracy for men and women.
Abolish Capitalism, take away the
huge, selfish, remorseless, savage pow
er of profits and profits can no longer
plunge the nations into war.
Give to the people the, sole control
of their own affairs and they will
never lead themselves into wholesale
slaughters.
All other talk of remedies, reforms,
measures, exhortations, appeals,
preachments, agreements, treaties,
peace conferences, gabble, talk fests,
protests, peace societies, arguments
and resolutions Is childish prattle.
One thing or the other: Abolish the
sources of war or prepare to see civi
lization crushed and your own coun
try with the irest reverted to the
state of the cave men.
WHICH SHALL IT BE?
weaving went into operation, when
the first domestic industries were
transferred from the home to the fac
tory, capitalism began to break up
the home as a workshop, the tradi
tional home of countless generations.
When the first women spinners and
weavers left their unpaid domestic
labor and entered the factories as
wage workers, capitalism began to
destroy the family, the traditional
family supported and controlled by its
male head. But the transformation
brought about by capitalism is still
incomplete. Although most industries
have been taken out of the home,
some remnants of domestic industry
still linger that necessitate the con
tinuous presence of women working
in a primitive way. Although women
have been given the opportunity to
become economically independent,
this independence is still supposed to
terminate with marriage, the econom
ic status of waves is still supposed to
be one of dependence upon their hus
bands. Socialism will merely lead the
present trend of development to its
rational and inevitable conclusion by
taking the last domestic industries
out of the home and sociializing them
like all others, and by giving all wom
en economic independence, regardless
of their marital relation,
U. S. DROPS BIRTH
CONTROL SUIT
The federal government has decid
ed not to bring Margaret Sanger to
trial for publishing her advocacy of
birth control.
Comrade Sanger's birth control
propaganda began several years ago
in the columns of The New York
Call. She was writing a series' of ar
ticles entitled "What Every Girl
Should Know," and the postal authori
ties stepped in and suppressed it.
Later on her husband received 30
days in jail for giving a copy of his
wife's "Family Limitations" to a spy.
The government has postponed the
trial of Mrs. Sanger several tiinies
and has at last decided to drop the
case because it has gained Mrs. San
ger a lot of supporters.
Her bdrth control propaganda should
be in the hands of every worker, but
the government forbids the transmis
sion of the knowledge. The knowl
edge, however, is getting into the pos
session of more and more people ev
ery year.
