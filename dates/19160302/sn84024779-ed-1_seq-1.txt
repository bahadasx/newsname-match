IN BEHALF OF
DELIVERY BOYS
An Interesting Public Letter Is
Written to the Times Ny a
Prominent Housewife
GIVE THEM HELPING HAND
Instead of Finding Fault—Have
Many Oares and Out in Ail
Sorts of Weather
Many newspaper and magazine
articles appear from time to time
in defense of telephone operators
who are blamed for everything
that goes wrong with the subscrib
ers.
For instance: "Phone out of
order," "Line Busy" "I can't hear
a word" "They don't Answer,"
and hundreds of things for which
the operator is not responsible. It
is not my intention to defend the
operators at this time but instead
will try to enlist the sympathy of
housewives and matrons in be
half of the three young boys
whose daily tasks it is to deliver
the loads and loat'ls of provisions
from the various meat markets
and grocery stores. When one
stops to consider the hundreds of
poundb of meat, butter, sugar,
flour, boxes of soap, apples, or
anges—canned good, such as corn
peas, siring beans, canned fruits
etc.
Besides hundreds of minor ar
ticles that these boys must handle
over and over during the day and
every day throughout the bitter
cold .through rain an| in sun
shine, one must conclue this posi
tion is not an enviable one and
that he's more to be pittied than
censured.
The boy who has the northwest
rout in this city has a hundred
an| seventy customers, besides
six deliveries at the Indian School
I say six, since he delivers at
the school proper, the mess hall,
the hospital, the laundry, the shop
and at the superintendent's resi
dence. Then he has four similar
deliveries to make at the S. S. S.
(The majftrlly of these stops are
made every day and often two or
three times a day.
It is not unusual to see the
boys on a bitter cold morning
wading through drifts knee deep
carrying a sack of flour and a box
containing several other articles.
Coming to the door of a residence
and funding it locked, he must
wait there, the pleasure of maid
or matron to unlock and kick

fore they have to make room for
him to set, I hem down. Often upon
arriving later than they had ex
pected he wouW, they greet him
with "well did you finally get here"
or, "well this is a late hour to
bring my meat vr dinner" not
thinking that had they phoned for
their meat the afternoon before,
or before the 8:30 delivery they
would be sure to have it in com
pletion for an early dinner. If the
orders are in on the afternoon be
fore, or the tirst delivery in the
morning, there will be no cause
for sarcastic greetings for the
boys as there is no better delivery
service to be found than we have
in Wahpeton—especially when we
consider that three boys do all the
delivering which was formerly
done by eight—or a delivery boy
for each of the stores and meat,
markets.
Kindly order your goods for the
day at one time and help make

WAHPETON WINS
FROM BATTLE LAKE
The Wahpeton High School bas
ket ball team defeated a similar
team from Battle Lake, Minn., Fri
day evening by the score of 33 to
12. The play was fast and furious
at all times and although only a
small crowd was present, which
was accounted for by the home
talent pity in the opera house, yet
the spectators that were present
got their money's worth. The
first half saw the Wahpeton team
take the lead and were never head
ed. The first half ended with the
score of 17 to 6 in favor of the
local team.
boys from here would lax a single
moment the Batte Lake team was
right there to take advantage of
it and scored. This kept the locals
on edge throughout the game. The
score would indicate that the
game was lopsided and uninter
esting, but such was not the case,
and those present say that it was
one of the best games of the sea
son.

Saturday night at 8 o'clock the
boys are all going over to the
city hall and see if something
drops out of the skies. We don't
know what's the reason for all the
talk, but it seems as if it is the
general opinion that something is
brewing in a way of a non-parti

Everybody that the Times re

the last two weeks when the men

Well we don't know. The can

are considering their indi^jual
candidacy in sober thoughts these
days, and most of them haven't
yet made up their minds whether
they will be a candidate again or
whether they will make the race.
