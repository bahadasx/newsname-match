The official Berlin statement issued
yesterday ignores the fighting at Ver

to at'ain and it is possible they may

to capture positions with the ob
ject of shelling points nearer their
objective Verdun.
East of Verdun around Pont-A-Mou.-'son,
the French have bombarded
German positions heavily In Le
I'retre wood and near Thiaeourt. Ar
tillery duels have been in progress
in Alsace. There has been no re
sumption of German attacks against
the French in the Champagne region.
While nothing of especial import
ance has taken place along the lVrit
ish part of the line the effect of the
German offensive in the Verdun re
gion is shown in the lengthening of
their front in order to release the
French for the reinforcement of the1
army opposing the German advance
Unofficial advices had placed the ex
treme southern end of the British
line in the region of Lends. The
latest British official communication
reports the British fighting north of
the Somme, which would show that
thev have stretched their front be-
tween thirty and forty miles down

PROSPECTS FOR
BI& PEACH CROP
CONTINUED COLD WEATHER HAS
RETARDED BUDDING AND WILL
BE BENEFICIAL TO THE LOCAL
GROWERS.
The continued cold weather, while
it has boon very uncomfortable for
some w ho were compelled to be out-of-doors,
will be a blessing to the
peach growers of this vicinity, as it
practically assures a peach crop for
the coming season. Well informed
poach growers who have been investi
gating conditions, state that the buds
have not begun to swell in anv of
t lie orchards they have examined, and
in their opinion the cold weather now
prevailing will continue to prevent
them doing so until all danger is past.
The peach growers of this section
have had to labor under most dis
couraging conditions for the past few
years. Their crops have boon badly
handled and in many Instances after
they had shipped to northern com
mission merchants they had to remit
cash to cover an alleged deficit. This
condition will be investigated by the
state at large, and unless some ade
quate means are devised whereby the
peach growers of Oklahoma are given

states, they

DEFENDANTS GUILTY AS WA3
CHARGED IN INFORMATION
HEAVY PENALTIES.
"You can say for me that we are
getting all the 'high-brow' liquor deal
ers who nourished in Wirt for a
season," said County Attorney Hardy
this morning, "and as fast, as one is
convicted and sentenced he Is sent to
the county jail to begin his task for
the state and county, not to a hotel
under guard. Of course, all have
served notice of appeal, but pending
the hearing, which will probably not
be had until after the present term
of district court is over, they will re
main the guests of the county."
Yesterday afternoon in district court
the jury in the case of the State vs.
Jeff Davis returned a verdict of guilty
and assessed the punishment at a
fine of five hundred dollars and a jail
sentence of thirty days.
The cases of the State vs. K. Wall
ing and Jim 'Freeman were dismissed
for want of evidence and the defend
ants discharged. These are two of
the few who have so far "got by"
in the district court, ns this term has
been most productive of convictions.
This morning, Deputies Mallow and
Jones returned from Kagtown with
some gambling paraphernalia and a
quantity of liquor, which they found
there last night. No arrests were
made in connection with the raid, as
the birds were found to be out when
the officers arrived.
Several additional cases will be
added to the original docket If the
activities of the officers keep up, but j
reports from the oil field state that
Ragtown is about the driest spot in
the county at present. Most of the
regulars, however, are in the city,
either to answer to charges for vio
lating the liquor laws, or are in jail
under conviction.

OFFICERS HAVE ACCURATE DE
SCRIPTION OF CULPRIT AND
FEEL. CONFIDENT OF HIS CAP
TURE. After searching nearly all night in
t!ie Caddo bottoms for the negro who
assaulted Mrs. Jim Payno yesterday
afternoon, the officers wore compelled
to return to the city and await day
light. Deputy tfherin Kendall staled
this morning that .Mrs. Payne said
the first thing she was aware of tie1
negro's' presence was shortly after
the dinner hour, after her husband
had returned to his work in the field,
some distance from the house.
The negro, who is best described by
tiie word "Hurley," entered the door
and demanded something to oat. Mrs.
1'ayne motioned to the table and told
him to help himself, lie replied that
the food did not suit him, and told
her to cook something warm for him.
She was about to comply when the
negro grabbed her by the w rist. She
began to scream, when the negro drew
a gun and began beating her on the
head. He failed to render her un
conscious, however, and her screams
soon frightened the negro away, and
attracted the attention of neighbors.
Mrs. Payne was severely cut about
the head, the walls of the room wore
bespattered with blood, and Mrs.
Payne was suffering from a severe
nervous shock when the officers and
physician arrived. She was able to
give an accurate description of the
negro, who in his flight lost his cap,
which was picked up by Deputy Ken
dall. The trail was taken, and followed
through the draws and bottoms of
Catldo to the negro settlement when
night overtook the officers. A num
ber of deputies left here this morning
to renew the search, and they feel
confident that they will capture the
negro before night.
Feeling in the neighborhood of the.
crime is high, and if the negro is
captured by the citizens before the
officers reach him, he probably will he
roughly handled. Sheriff Garrett re
turned from the scene of the crime
about three o'clock this morning, and
stated that he felt confident of the
negro's capture as soon as the depu
ties took tho trail again.
The negroes in the Caddo settle
ment are, as a rule, law-abiding citi
zens, and will not hesitate to give the
officers any information they possess
as to the whereabouts of .the culprit.
Mrs. Payne's condition was reported
satisfactory this morning, and while
her wounds are painful, they are in
nowise dangerous, unless unforseen
complications arise.

The longer the hotel question is
delayed, the more apparent it be

minister of war trade says
British have always con-
contended armed Liners
SHOULD use cuns.
London, March 1. On the eve of
the tlale set by Cermany for the be
ginning of her new submarine cam
paign against armed merchant vessels,
Iaw. Robert Cecil, minister of war
trade, lias issued a statement giving
the Iiriiish view of the status of
such merchantmen. This statement,
which is in answer to queries whether
merchantmen have boon instructed to
take the offensive against subtiiar-i
ine.i, says:
' The British view has always been
that tb fen.'ively armed merchantmen
must not fire on submarines or any
other warships except in self-tlu-fense.
The Germans have twisted a
passage in a document taken from
a transport which they stink into
meaning that merchant vessels have
instructions to take the offensive.
This is not so.
"The passage In question, -which
lays down a maximum distance be
yond which merchant ships are ad
vised not to fire, must be read in
conjunction with another passage
which makes it perfectly clear that
merchant vessels must not attack
unless a submarine unmistakably
.hows hostile intentions."'
The German memorandum dealing
with armed merchantmen received
from Derlin Feb. 10 contained the
following alleged Instructions to their
merchantmen, said to have been tak-
i en from a liritisli boat captured or
sunk by the Germans:
"If a defensively armed vessel is

President Wilson tells chair

resolution warning Americans

Chairman Flood said he be
lieved that some resolution ac
ceptable to the president would
be agreed upon today.
It is reported that ten mem
bers of the foreign relations
committee favor reporting out
the McLamore warning resolu
tion, while nine are against it.
The administration forces on
account of the delay in the
house, turned to the senate to
day to carry out Wilson's de
mand for the defeat of the re
solutions warning Americans
ofr armed ships.
Chairman Stone of the for
eign relations committee an
nounced that he is not in accord
jvvith Wilson and proposed that
the senate adjourn to another
(legislative day to clear the par
liamentary situation, which
held the Gore resolution from

Senator Gore declared that
() the impelling reason for this
i course was the report that Wil

be ungrateful and might result
'in advancing civilization by
1 bringing about an end to the
Ijuropean war by nud-sum-
mer."

President Wilson and repub
lican leader Mann will discuss

ternoon. President Wilson is
seeking the republican support.
There was a spirited debate
in the senate today over the
ship question. Senator Gore
defended his resolution, saying

there are lots of them."
