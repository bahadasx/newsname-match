Why They Do It
Did you ever notice that the man who pays by check
always inspires you with a sort of confidence? Do you
know why this is so? It is because the man with the
bank account is usually on his road to success. It is gen
erally taken for granted that the man who conducts his
business through banking channels is making good. And
it is usually so. Why? Is is because only the successf ul
men do business through a bank or because the bank
helps them to be successful? We invite you to open an
account at this bank and see if it don't help you on the
road to success.
