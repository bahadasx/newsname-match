' We Are For Bkeldedge
The 'Chief hopes that our townsman,
L. H. Iilackledgc, will conclude to
enter the field for the nflice of District
Judge of this judicial district. Tho
district comprises the counties of
Adams, Franklin, Harlan, Kearney,
Phelps and Webster. Webstor county
is second in population in the district
and Is entitled to the Judge, novcr hav
ing had that ofllclal. Since Judge
Duugaii, of Adams county, has. now
held the office for nine years we believe
that It would be none else than fair
were another lawyer and another
county recognized by the voters of the
district for that ofllce, although the
present Incumbent bos filled the posi
tion, so far as wc know, in a very
creditable manner.
Suoh positions arc honorable ones
which should be passed around among
the persons who are deserving and
well qualified to fill them.
Mr. Blacklcdge Is especially dtted
by temperament, character and train
ing to hold the ofllce of District Judge,
He is a successful lawyer of over
twenty five years experience, the last
sixteen of which have been in Web
ster coudty. His praotlec has extended
largely to other counties, as well as
in the Supreme Court. He is general
ly recognized as being one of the
ablest lawyers in the district, and Is
particularly known as being always
on the square. He is gentlemanly and
courteous in his bearing, although
somewhat tesened uud dullbornlo In
octi.on. He seems to us, and to many
citizens wiiom wo nave iieiinl express
tiicmselvus. ns especially well qualified
for the place and we hope lie will make
the taeo. '
