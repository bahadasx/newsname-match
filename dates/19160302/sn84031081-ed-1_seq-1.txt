Washington, March L -President
VVIIhou serve notice on congress to
night that he will consent to nothlnif
less than a record vote on tho antl
nd ministration resolution to warn
Americans off thearmed ships of Ku
ropenn belligerents before he goes on
with the German submarine negotia
tions. No compromise , proposition
such ns a vols of confidence in the
president s foreign policy will ho ac
ceptable. Such nn action. It Is held,
j might be construed in Herlln as Jus
tifying the opinion that the president
lucks the support of congress and his
own party In his demands for full oh.
servnnco of international law while
Its enly purpose would be to afford
members of congress a way to avoid
recording their positions before the
country on the straight out-and-out
question.
President Wilson made his position
clear to congressional leaders tonight
In unequivocal tgernis as the climax
to a day of confusion, uncertainty and
political maneuvering- which marked
tint opening of his first real fight with
AmngruMh. .. .
As If to emphasize that tho presi
dent absolutely ( refuses to continue
the, negotiations with 'Germany until
the attitude' ot congress Is settled, it
was made known that-tho United
States does not consider the latent as
surances from Count' von Uornatorff,
the German aml'itssador, as broad or
as satisfactory as those , originally
given. No further steps will bo taken,
however, while the president waits on
congress. Meanwhile the pending
Lusltnnlii agreement will not. bo fin
ally accepted.
I.einlcrs Cull. si In Uonferciu'c.
The whole situation In congress,
confused by the president's call yes
terday for a. vote, wus thrown Into ft
snarl today when' at pn early morn
ing conference the. president outlined
his position to Senators Stono and
Kern and Representative Flood, chair
man of the foreign affairs committee
of the house, Speuker Clnrk, House
Lender Kludiln and Acting Chairman
Pou, of the, house rules committeo.
As soon as tho delegation returned
to the capito) with news of what tho
president had said It wns apparent
that some of the leaders who had
secretly supported tho nnti-admlnls-tration
forces and under administra
tion pressure had pocketed resolu
tions in committeo when there was
danger of their being adopted, real
ize,! that, the president and his friends
had suddenly gained tho whip hand.
It was plain that they at once devot
ed their ef'orts to attempts to avoid
a defeat at the hands of the admin
istration forces by side-tracking tho
main Issues and making the fight
turn to a vote on a. resolution of con
fidence for the pi'Mident In which
they could Join without! compromising .
their position In support of warning
Americans to avoid belligerent armed
ships.
Practically In' control of tho ma
chinery of the house, these leaders
held the situation In deadlock all day
while they conferred and sought for
sonic proposal which would satisfy
tho president and still save their po
sitions. Friends of the president, watching
the maneuvering closely, saw the ob
ject and tonight from the White;
Mouse come word that there would
be no compromise. Congress will
meet tomorrow raring it clear-cut is-
nie with Ih" president.
Politics Is Charged.
The president's friends openly
charge that resistancf to his program
is purely political. They make it un
mistakably clear llial he does not In
tend to let the question be passed over
by a compromise Und risk' being em-arrax.ii-.l
later In his negotiations with
Germany by Inning the agitation
come up again to weaken his hand.
They say ho Intends -to have the ques
tion removed one,, and for all from
the field of possibilities and point out
that the extent of the opposition
which the president faces may ho
,iud.:ed from tho. fact that the chair
men of the for lgu ' affairs commit
tees in both brunches of congress and
even Speaker ( lark were, to say the
least, lukewarm In their support of
him. ' ' '
The administration whips in their
cnnvtisH have satisfied themselves that
majority
of the rank and file of the
democrats and many of the republi
cans will stand by the president if
