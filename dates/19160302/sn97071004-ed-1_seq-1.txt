BERLIN GIVES ORDER
TO DESTROY LINERS
Armed Traders to Be Treated
as Warships by Submarines.
U. S. TOLD: "TOO LATE TO POSTPONE"
Washington Is Advised That Great
Britain Is Not Trusted Many
Broken Pledges Cited.
Washington. D. C Cermsny has
intruded Count von Bernsstorff to in
form the United States government
that the assurances regarding the fu
ture continuance of submarine war
fare, given in the Lusitania and Ara
bia cases, still are binding, but that
thev anply only to merchantmen or a
peaceful character.
The Government is understood to
contend thst armed merchantmen,
without regard to the nature of their
armament, have shown themselves not
to be peaceful, and therefore subject
to destruction without warning.
The instructions direct the Oerman
ambassador particularly to tell Secre
tary Lansing that British merchant
ment armed ostensibly only for de
fense, have not assumed the character
of peaceful traders, but on the con
trary, they carry guns for the especial
purpose of attacking uerman suoma-
rines. To support this contention, the
Berlin foreign office has sent the am
bassador, for presentation to the State
denartmenL a list of at least 20 Inci
dents where it is asserted British mer
chant ships have attacked submarines.
Confidential advices received iroro
Berlin sav that German and Austrian
submarine commanders already have
received their new order and that from
midnight Tuesday thev were author
ized to sink without warning all armed
merchant ships of the enemies or uer-
many.
It was said also that many or tne
submarine commanders probably had
left their bases on voyages ana that
even should the United States request
the Dostoonement of the opening of
the campaign, it would; be impossible
to get word to many or tne sudim
rines. It was said, however, that so
far neither the United States nor any
other nation had asked for a postpone- j
ment. i
Count von Bernstorff and other
officials of the German embassy de
clined to discuBS the instructions from
Berlin in any way Monday.
Count von Bernstorff received nis in
structions in reply to a request from
the United States for assurances re
garding the conduct of submarine
warfare in the future, occasioned by
the memorandum announcing the in
tention of Germany to sink armed
ships without warning, which the ad
ministration considered to be inconsist
ent with the assurances previously
given.
Regardless of the form in whtcn
the matter is presented to Secretary
Lansing, the German ambassador will
lay much Btresa on the assurances re
garding the arming of merchant ships
which were given to the United States
by Great Britain in a memorandum
signed by Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, the
British ambassador, August 25, 1914.

CONGRESS DELAYS
! OPPOSING WILSON
on Submarine Situation
Put Off by Both Houses.
P. J. BRYAN IS AGAINST PRESIDENT
Plain Talk Exchanged but President
Wilson Still Stands Solidly for
Full Rights of Americans.
Waahlnirtnn. TV C. Ton ore us settled
down Saturday to await developments
in tne suomanne controversy oeiween
the United States and Germany with
an overwhelming majority of both
houses apparently deflnietly deter
mined to take no action which might
embarrass the administration in the
present stage of diplomatic negotia
tions a few of the more ardent advo
cates of legislation to keep Amreicans
off armed ships continued their activ
ities, and ex-Secretary Bryan's sup
nort for them was shown in the form
of a telegram, but even most of them
admitted there was no nropect of im
mediate action.
So far as the administration is
concerned, it wss said authoritatively
that while any agitation of the issue
lust now waa undesirable, mere was
m Hmnrtaitinn to onnnae a vote on tne
nendinir armed-shin resolutions if their
sponsors tried to force one.
It waa declared that reports irom
the capitol during the day showed con
clusively that the senate and the house
would stand behind President Wilson
in his refusal to permit any abridge
ment of tha riirhta of American citi
tens on the seas, as outlined in his let
ter tn Senator Stone.
The President reiterated his state
ments in that letter to Speaker Clark:
Majority Leader Kitchin and Repre
sentative Flood, chairman of the bouse
fnreiim affairs committee, early in the
day when they called at the White
House to tell of the situation on their
side of the capitol and hear the execu
tive's views.
There was plain speaking both by
President Wilson and his callers. Mr.
Wilson said plainly that bis efforts to
keep the country at peace were likely j
to be hindered by impressions sent
abroad by congress, and the congress
men were equally Iran in giving
notice that a strong sentiment existed
at the capitol against risking the pos
sibility of war by permitting Ameri
cans to travel on armed belligerent
ships, whatever might be their rights
under international law.
Although wholly different reports
came from other sources during the
day, Speaker Clark declared he be
lieved a resolution to warn citizens off
armed vessels would carry in the house
by two to one if it reached a vote.
The house delegation went back to
the capitol with word that the Presi
dent stood unalterably by his position.
There the situation rests, and while
there probably will be many more con
ferences and possibly some speeches,
the generally accepted opinion is mat
no further serious effort to bring about
action will be made, unless develop
ments occur to make a rupture of re
lations with Germany imminent.
Pekin Admits Rebels Defeated
Government Troops at Sze-Chuen
Pekin Official acknowledgement of
the defeat of government troops oy
the Yunnan rebels on the Sze-Chuen
border waa withheld until Saturday,
when the State department issued a
mandate denouncing Tai Ao, in which
nrimiHuainn is made that the revolu
tionists surprised the regular army and
defeated a small garrison.
Information received in reKin irom
nnn-r,hineHA sources shows that the
Yunnanese, who descended on the city
of Suifu and captured it, numbered
about 10,000. The government gar-
risnn at Suifu numbered about 4000,
but these troops left for the north sev
eral days before the arrival oi tne
Yunnanese and consequently there was
no resistance to the entrance of the
latter. The fleeing government forces
are renorted to have started north for
Tze-Chow.
Women to Urge Defense.
Rt T iuis Miss Anne Morgan,
daughter of the late John Pierpont
Morgan, will be a delegate to the con
ference of mayors on national prepar
edness which will begin here March 3,
nrmrdinflr to an announcement by Mrs.
Philip N. Moore, president of the Na
tional Council of Women. Mrs. Moore
Bid that nn March 5 a mass meeting
would be held to "clinch the sentiment
of the women of the country to pre
pare the nation to defend itself.
AMERICAN NAYY THIRD ON IIST;
EQUAL TO ANY BY YEAR 1925
Washington, D. C The object of
the building policy formulated in 1918
by the Navy General Board, It was dis
closed Wednesday before the house na
val committee, was to keep the United
States ahead of Germany in the race
for naval supremacy. The statement
was made by Rear Admiral Charles J.
Badger, a member of the general
hnnrH whn explained that the Policy
had contemplated a fleet of 48 first-line
battleships by 1919 to accompiisn lis
purpose.
The statement did not go Into the
record of the hearing and Admiral
Badger did not amplify it to show why
the board had thought such a course
necessary.
The admiral was replying to a sug
gestion that the object of the old pol
icy, abandoned this year by the board
for the first time, was to keep the
American navy in second place. While

that was the effect it had, he said, the
real object was to keep ahead of Ger
many. This year the board fixed as its pol
icy the creation by 1925 of a fleet
equal to the most powerful afloat at
that time, he said. Tne committee
did not go into the board's reasons for
rhanunnc its ideas bevond drawing out
the explanation that the board believed
a fleet 10 per cent superior to any
fighting force that might be. brought
against it would be necessary to in
sure against the invasion oi American
soil by an enemy.
Under Questioning by Representative
Kelly, Admiral Badger said the con
struction of three additional oreaa-
naughts and eight battle cruisers
would place the navy on a par with the
ranital ahiDs of the German fleet to
day. Germany now has 22 dread-
naughts and eight battle cruiBers, ne
said, according to the best available
information, while the United States
has all told 19 ships of the dreadnaugnt
class, built or building.
Tn eniial Creat Britain's neet witnm
two veara. Admiral Badger said, the
United States would be obliged to nave
a total force of 40 dreadnaughts, 15
battle cruisers, 25 swift scouting craft,
200 submarines and 250 destroyers.
Ha m nnt f&vnrinp such a program.
but merely answering questions by
Representative Butler. Such a fleet
could not be built m two years, ne
added, though it might be constructed
in four.

7 GERMAN CORPS
IN VERDUN DRIVE
Army of 280,000 Engaged in
Attack on 25-Mile front
FIRST LARGE BATTLE OF PRESENT YEAR
May Be Forerunner of More Decisive
Events Battle Only Begun ' .
Gain Small; Loss Heavy.
Paris The battle of Verdun contin
ues with growing intensity. It ex
tends rfver a-front of 400 kilometers
(25 miles), and seven German army
corps (280,000 men), "are engaged.
This announcement was made officially
by the war office.
The official statement issued earlier
in the day made reference to the ener
getic bombardment being conducted
in that region, but referred to the In
fantry activity as extending over a
front of only 15 kilometers (10 miles).
There was violent fighting at other
points on the French front as welL
'The struggle." says the War omce
communication, "is continued with
violence against the right bank of the
Meuse toward the southeast. East of
this point a counter attack enabled ua
to retake tne greater part or tne xorest
of Causes, situated in the salient oc
cupied by the enemy . north of Beau
mont.
"A strong German attack on Herbe
forest was stopped by our curtain fire.
According to statements of prisoners,
whole units were completely destroyed
in the course of these actions.
"A desultory artillery duel contin
ues in the region of Haute Charriere
and of Fromerey in Torraine. In the
region of Nomeny, our artillery has
been active. An enemy reconnaissance
north of Letri court failed to reach our
lines. :
"In the Herbe forest we have evac
uated the village of Haumont. We
still hold the envirous after a bitter
fight, in which our troops inflicted
heavy losses on the enemy."
The great battle raging along the
25-mile front from Etain to Malan-
court is being followed with intense
interest bv the public It disposes
effectively of the question whether the
Germane would make an early offen
sive. The battle is the first on a large
scale since the offensive in the Cham
pagne in September and is believed to
be the forerunner of stirring and pos
sibly decisive events.
The principal fighting centers in the
rough and thickly wooded country be
tween Etain and Damvillers. Here
some 300,000 of the German Crown
Prince's best infantry are engaged.
The battle as yet is only beginning,
but it is said already to have cost the
assailants of the French heavy casual
ties and without any appreciable ad
vantage.
President and Congress at Outs
Over Germany's Proposed Sea Rule
Washington. D. C Agitation in
congress for action warning Americans
off armed ships of the European bel
ligerents suddenly grew to sucn pro
portions Thursday that Democrats of
the foreign affairs committee voiea hi
canvass the sentiment of the nouse on
several pending resolutions of that na
ture.
Sentiment in the senate in favor of
some such action also was expressed
openly, but at the end of a day of sur
prises, tension and agitation such as
has not been seen tn congress in some
time, the word came that President
Wilson still was unalterably opposed to
any such action by congress, and that
he would only be embarrassed tnereoy
in the negotiations with uermany.
Kuirirestions were widely circulated
that the situation had reached a point
where the President soon would lay it
before congress, that Secretary Lans
inir miirht in some way define the at
titude of the government in a commu
nication to Senator btone, ana m a
time had been fixed within which the
United States would expect Germany
to signify her intention to abandon the
announced intention to sink armed
merchant ships without warning.
