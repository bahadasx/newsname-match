The United States Marine Corps
is unique in all branches of the
American services, in having a dis
tinctive marching song that is as
swingy, and catchy, as many of the
loreign marching songs. True,
West Point has its Benny Havens
song and the Seventh Cavalry
mai'ches to the inspiring tune of
Garry Owen, but the "Halls of
Montezuma" is sung by all who
wear the Marine's uniform. One
verse of the song a favorite one
runs :
"Our flap's unfurled to every' breeze,
From dawn, to setting sun,
Wo have fought in every clime and
place
Where wo could take a gun;
In the snow of far off Northern lands
And in sunny tropic scenes,
You will find us always on the job,
The United Stntds Marines."

TO BE A BOOSTER
THE SPARROW HUNT
Pazazzas and Mazumas Secure
Many Birds in Contest.
Tlie weather favored the hunters
who were chosen by Captains Geo.
J. Munger and R. R. Hartshorn in
the sparrow limit on Monday and
Tuesday.
The hunt is believed to have
made the real start when Tom
Franey drove up to Roachton, Sun
day morning with a large bag of
salt in his buggy. At Roachton
the birds are very tame and Tom
sprinkled salt on the tails of many
and Capt. Munger says the birds
had been dead so long, the salt was
very necessary.
C. P. Champney did very nicely
with a new style 6f shell which he
prepared for use in his gun. The
shells contained asphyxiating gas
and when exploded near a flock of
birds they fainted and Avaited for
"Champ" to gather them in.
Don Whitehead had been feed
ing "hypopilorum" to his birds
which gave them "Spinal-come-n-git-us"
and Don got 'em promptly.
George' Schwind's barn and
Adamson's elevator made large
contributions, although Schwind
declares Adamson's cat stole 140
of his birds. Adamson denies the
allegation, and thereby another
"Court Trial" may result.
Edgar Hoffmann, to save him
self "squeeled" on the bunch and
said that Jacob Schrumm was the
source of supply for many birds
and. that when he called on Jake
he was told that Capt. Hartshorn
had "phoned" his order for 1200
birds, but that Capt. Munger had
come down in an auto just ahead
of Hartshorn and got them.
John Wilson said it was a simple
case of "Preparedness" and that
Capt. Munger was like the Kaiser,
well prepared with supplies for
the battle.
Col. Kingsbury resented the in
sinuation that there was something
wrong with his gun. He shot four
times and got 00 birds.
Wm. Mills thought he was some
hunter when he produced 41 birds,
but lost his appetite when he saw
the Editor's count of 123.
Capt. Hartshorn can blame his
defeat to Franey, Adamson and
Schwind for failing to mobilize
their' forces earlier in tho contest.
At tho splendid banquet served
by tho W. O. W. Ladies Mayor
Roether ably presided as toast
master and all enjoyed tho meet.
The total birds was 2G7G. Capt
Munger's Pazazzas secured 1071
and Capt. Hartshorn's Mazumas
brought in 1005.
A Specific Against Colds.
Tho nearest thing to a specific
against colds is a sleeping porch or
open bed room and a cold sponge bath
every morning when you first get uu.
Even then you will occasionally take
a cold, especially when colds aro epi
demic, and when you do you will find
Chamberlain's 'Cough Remedy a great
help in enabling you to get rid of it.

Yeggs Secure $130 from Herman
Winkler's Saloon Saturday
Safe crackers made a haul of
$130 in the saloon of Herman
Winkler early Saturday morning.
The, saloon is on the Perrysburg
road, between Rossford and Eagle
Point.
The robbery was discovered by
an employe of Winkler's, who
opened the place for business Sat
urday morning at 5.
He found the door blown from
the safe, but the interior of the
saloon was not damaged.
A Ford glass employe says he
saw three men, one lame, near the
saloon early Saturday morning.
MAN KILLED IN RUNAWAY
Christopher Hahn Killed When
Team Plunges Over Bank.
Christopher Hahn, 38, of Maple
wood road, was" killed Saturday
when his horses became frightened
and plunged 20 feet over an em
bankment. The accident happened south of
Rossford. The injured man was
found by a driver of a Lasalle &
Koch Co. truck and taken to the
office of Dr. L. J. Ilerold in Ross
ford. Ilahn's skull was fractured. He
died shortly after the doctor's
office "was reached.
Hahn was on his way home from
Toledo. It is thought a Perrysburg
car frightened the team which was
found standing quietly near the
scene of the accident.
Hahn leaves a widow and a sou
aged 12:
AUTOMOBILE STOLEN
Chester Crandall, residing near
Moline, is looking for his 7-passen-ger
Studebaker which was stolen
from his garage on Saturday night.
As there was no water in the
radiator, and only one gallon of gas
oline in the tank at the time, the
prospects are it didn't go far with
out needing supplies.
