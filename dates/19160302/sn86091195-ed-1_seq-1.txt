K. OF P. MINSTRELSY
The K. of P. minstrel show which is
to be staged in the Orpheum theatre,
Monday evening, March 6th, promises
to be something out of the ordinary.
They are sparing nothing to make this
the most spectacular as well as the
cleverest show of the season and the
people of Blackfoot feel that their time
has been well spent in patronizing this
'•'■'■home production.
The end men, or funmakers, consist
of'Dr. Williams, Chapman, Snodgrass
and Turner.
Solo artists: Allen, Page, Unkifer,
and Kraeneeke.
The chorus consists of ."10 people, men
and girls, and the hard, faithful work
which they have put in on the chorus
bids fair to be something out of the
ordinary.
There will be specialties and vaude
ville stunts and last, but not least, a
plantation scene in which the entire
company will take part; lots of danc
ing and good old southern fun and they
say the negro wedding is a iitting.
climax.
Owing to so many counter attractions
it has been decided to show but one
night, Monday, March 6 and from the
interest which is now manifested there
will be a big rush at Dustin's drug
store Saturday morning for the advance
seat sale, so those wishing good seats
should make early reservations by
phone.
Watch the windows in the business
section for further particulars and
above all things boost for the K. of P.
First Annual Minstrel Show.—adv.

MARS—I'M SICK AND TIRED OP THIS BLOODY BUSINESS.
LEGISLATE FOR HONESTY
Now that the State of Idaho has
legislated the saloonmen out of busi
ness, some of whom were responsible,,
honorable citizens, and when we speak
of saloonmen we do not mean dive
keepers, most of whom that were legis
lated out of business by local option
are now keeping poolrooms or bootleg
ging, two vocations that are more de
moralizing to the. rising generations
than the regulated saloon ever was, is it
not possible to enact some law that will
make men more honest with tlieij
creditors and neighbors Otiose credit"
and confidence are so generously be
stowed upon them. How it would
lighten the burdens of life if men were
honest with one another, if their word
was their bond, and their confidences
held inviolate. Then there would be
want or financial embarrassments
as there would always be a helping
hund extended in the times of need.
It is but once in awhile you meet a
man whom you can trust, or a friend
to whom you can lend a dollar or two
and get it back without losing his
friendship and receiving his ill will for
your assistance and trust. This deplor
able condition of society reminds us ->t
the old San Francisco beer saloon poem
that is more truthful than poetical:
"I had a friend and I did trust him;
I lost my friend and I lost his custom;
To lose my friend it grieved me so,
That I resolved to trust no more.
To trust is to bust,
To bust is Hell;
No trust no bust,
No bust no Hell."
There are times when honest men,
through idleness, sickness, and other un
avoidable circumstances, cannot pay
their honest debts, and should not be
blamed or even criticized for their mis
fortune; and there are other men who
do not believe in frittering away their
money paying debts which do not seem
to worry them the least bit. Some of
them are too indolent or improvident
to meet their obligations, while others
squander their earnings on the luxuric
of life, while their creditors get barely
the necessities. The latter two classes
of debtors are social outlaws iu tie
j
estimation of honest men
and
should
be punished even more severel
v than
the petit larceny theif
who
would
rather steal than work, or
the
klepta
maniac, who is subject
to
c- ramp*»
whenever his hands come
with another's property.

some eases deprived it of thp honest j
earnings of their sires who have been i
tempted to chase fickle fortune on the !
