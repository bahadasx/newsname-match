!
I Washington, March (2. The armed
I ship Issue suddenly blazed up in the
i senate today with the most sensa-
i tional debate of the session, in which
Senatpr Gore, Democrat, and author
: of a resolution to warn Americans
' off belligerent vessels, repeated what
$i he characterized as a report that
j; President Wilson had told certain con-
'' gress leaders that "a war between the
United States and Germany might
1 not be ungrateful and might result
in advancing civilization by bringing
; about the end of the European war
i bv mid-summer "
" Chairman Stone Denies Story.
Chairman Stone, of the foreign re
lations committee, emphatically de-
: nied that the president ever had ex
; pressed any such sentiment in his
hearing and Senator James, another
! administration leader, demanded to
5 know why Senator Gore had not
1 sought to "confirm the report from the
i ; president himself.
;- Senator Gore responded that he had
hoped the report was untrue; that he
had repeated it only as a report sur-
rounded by circumstances which gave
', it credence in his opinion but that
1' he was gjad to hear it denied
I, Storm Breaks In Senate.
' The storm broke In the senate un-
expectedly when Senator Stone, an-
nounced that he was not in accord-
X with the president's demand for a de-
v feat of the armed ship resolutions,
t and would propose amendments to
p Senator Gore's resolution in order to
let it come to a vote, and Senator
I James announced the administration

V clared at the proper time he would
: put squarely before the senate wheth-
j er the sinking of an ai'med merchant
j vessel by a submarine would be con-
'i sldered sufficient cause for war.
? "I introduced my resolution because
K I was apprehensive wc were heading
-? toward war," ho said, "My act was
;l based on a report which seemed to
me to come from the highest author
ity that certain senators and members
of the house in a conference with the
I president received from him the in
timation, if not the declaration, that
' ' if Germany insisted on her position,
the United States would insist upon
: hers, and that this would result prob-
j! : ably in a breach of diplomatic rela-
tions and a breach of diplomatic rela
l tions would probably bo followed by
j ; a state of war, and that a state of

Calls for Denial.
"If the senator from 'Missouri, the
chairman of the foreign relations com-
, rnittee, will deny it, that will satisfy
'J me. If the senator from Indiana says
'j j' it is not true, I will accept that"
' 'v "I do not know why the senator
; ;' quoted me," replied Senator Stone.
"I did not quoto the senator," rc-
J sponded Senator Gore.
j "Well, in fairness to the president,"
) said Senator Stone, "I think I should
state that the president never stated
to me, nor stated in my hearing, that
he believed, or in anyway entertained,
the thought that war between the
(. I'uited States rind the central powers
i ould be desirable or would result in
i any good, or would not bo ungrate-
5 ful."
i 1 Kern Speaks Sternly.
I "It is well known that the president
t if has a passion for peace," interjected
' Senator Kern in a tone that indicated
i riat denial of Senator Goro's charges.
j; "I have no passion for peace," Sen-
j ator Gore responded. "I do not be-
j I lieve all peace is honorable, or that all
'i war is dishonorable, but I repeat that
?j what I heard of the reported conversa-
'l tlon between the president and the
senator from Missouri was believed to

U second time.

. James ABks Pointed Question.
; "The senator from Oklahoma is one
of the president's closest friends,''
said Senator James of Kentucky.
"Why did he not go to him and ascer
tain just what he said. I am sure the
president would have been glad to tell
him."
"In the first place I had no evidence
that I might be taken into the presi
dent's confidence, or that Imlght re
ceive his impressions in the matter,"
Senator Gore replied. "I acted on
what seemed to me to bo the facts. I
have only undertaken to tell of the
report as it came to me.
"Whatever may have been the con
versation between the president and
Senator Stono I hope the impression
received by me and others was a mis
taken one.
No Choice of Enemies.
"Whenever the -ital interests of the
United States or the essential rights
of American citizens are violated or
outraged I will go as far as any one
to arm the president with every avail
able power to wage war, whether it be
with Germany or any nation under the
sun. I have no choice of enemies."
Senator Gore took his seat and for
a moment there was tense silence.
The vice president called upon Sen
ator Shields to continue with the
water power bill under discussion and
the international debate was closed

LINING OP FOR
VOTE IN SENATE
Gore Resolution to Be Taken
Up Without Waiting for
Complex House Action.
STONE MAKES SPEECH
Senator Lodge Upholds Presi
dent's View on Armed
Ship Issue.
Washington. March 2. Administra
tion forces evidently are lining .up for
a vote in the senate on the armed
ship resolutions. Senator Stone at the
opening of the" session today pro
posed an adjournment to take the sen
ate out of recess in which it has been
working, so as to clear the parliamen
tary situation for a vote on Senator
Gore's resolution.
Senator Stone made the suggestion,
after a conference with administra
tion leaders, who decided the situa
tion in the house was so complex
with possibility of delay that they
would not wait for a vote, but would
go ahead in the senate where they
are confident the anti-administration
resolutions can be defeated It seem
ed to be the -plan to bring the Gore
resolution up tomorrow.
Senator James, one of the adminis
tration supporters, said:
"It has been decided to bring tho
resolution up for action as soon as
possible, but probably not today. We
have got the votes in the senate to
smash It."
Stone Makes Statement.
Senator Stone from tho floor an
nounced that ho and President Wilson
were not in accord ou tho issue.
Senntor Stone's statement follows:
"A sharp issue has been defined be
tween Germany and Great Britain as
to tho status of armed merchantmen.
Germany contends that armed mer
chant vessels are the equivalent of
auxiliary war vessels and has an
nounced her policy to be, that after
March 1 armed merchantmen would
be regarded as warships and subject
to the rules of war.
"On the other hand Great Britain
contends that under international
law merchantmen have tho right to
bo armed for defensive purposes and
that armed merchantmen are entitled
under the law to the same Immunity
as unarmed ships, without regard to
cargo. She has announced her inten
tion to carry out that policy.
Policy of United States.
"Now where does tho United
States come in? In this way. If both
porsist In these courses, neither yield
ing to each other nor to the importu
nities of neutral nations and if Ger
many attacks nn armed merchantman
and any American citizen is injured,
the question is presented to this gov
ernment what our attitude would be,
If no Amorlcan citizens were on board
we have no cause to interfere, unless
we proceeded on the altruistic theory
of obligations of humanity.
Avoid Political Bias.
"To my mind this emergency is of
high importance. The president, sen
ators and representatives should
speak with eoch other and with the
country, free from political bias. We
should wear our hearts an out sleeves
so we may know our positions ex
actly. "The president's attitude is this:
He supports the contention that bel
1 llgercnt merchantmen have the right
to bear arms for defensive purposes,
but he does not say, nor do I know,
f and I doubt if any one does, what con
stitutes defensive purposes.
"Furthermore, if a German warship
without warning should attack and
. sink a merchantman, the president
proposes to consider the attack a law
less act. He will be disposed to hold
the German government to strict ac
countability, and if the German gov
ernment persisted, ho would be tempt
ed to sever diplomatic relations and
submit tho matter to congress which
under the 'constitution, is the war
making body.
Disagrees With President.
"If it must come to thiss and I must
disagree with tho president and if I
must disagree with my colleagues, I
must not face this as a political ques
tion. My duty Is clear. I cannot but
believe that if a belligerent mer
chantman Is armed, whether for de
fensive or offensive purposes, If It
is transporting war material, it is the
equivalent of a war vessel.
"I cannot discuss the question now,
but will merely state that in duty to
myself, to ray constituents and to my
country, I will discuss It here at
lr-ngth in the near future. The presi
dent is opposed to the Gore resolu
tion. He is not only opposed to laws
on the subject, but to any form of
official warning keeping people off
belligerent ships.
"If I could have my way I would
take somestep t save this country
from becoming embroiled in the Euro
pean war through the recklessness ot
, some thoughtless citizen.
"The president has written Repre
sentative Pou that the resolution has
been a source of embarrassment to
him in the diplomatic negotiations
with the belligerents. I am sure that
is so I have diligently sought to pre
vent resolutions on this subject be
ing adopted and sought to allay agi
tation on this subject Now we are
Informed that the resolution must be
defeated."
Senator Stone declared it was his
hope that something could be done
at once to bring the president and
congress more- closely in accord on.
the issue and that hewas framing a
substitute for all pending resolutions
on the subject.
Lodge for Prompt Action.
Senator Lodge of Massachusetts,
lanking Republican member of the
foreign relations, declared he was in
accord with Senator Stone's desire
for prompt action, and he agreed that
the issue was more important than
anvthlng else now before congress.
President Wilson and Republican
Leader Mann of the house will discuss
the attitude of Republicans on the
armed ship issue at 5 o'clock this aft
ernoon at tho president's request.
The president Intends to place the Is
sue squarely before the Republicans
In an effort to gain their support.
President Is Right.
Senator Lodge replied that the pres
ident had a right to ask for a vote
on the precise proposition of warning
Americans, inasmuch as the issue had
hampered his negotiations, so that he
could know whether he could proceed
with diplomatic negotiations with
congress behind him.
"I have listened with profound in
terest to what has been said by the
senator from Missouri." said Senator
Lodge. "I thoroughly appreciate the
gravity of tho situation to which he
has called attention. I agree entirely
with him that this is not a party
question. I also agree that our first
duty is to dispose of the precise Issue
that has been raised by the discus
sion to which he has referred
"I think the president, hampered
as he tells us in the letter to Repre
sentative Pou, In his diplomatic ne
gotiations, has a right to ask for a
vote on the precise proposition In or
e'er that he may know whether he can
ko on with his negotiations with con
crer behind him or whether con
gress takes the view of the belligerent
power with which he is negotiating. I
hope the senate will take an early
vote on the precise question as to
whether American citizens can travel
on armed merchant ships, a right
which has not been questioned for
centuries past."

"SOFT SOAP" IS
NOT ACCEPTABLE
Wilson Will Consent to No
Compromise on Armed
Ship Question.
IS CLEAR CUT ISSUE
Vote of Confidence Not Want
ed by President Question
Must Not Be Muddled.
Washington, March 2 President
Wilson today told Chairman Flood
of his foreign affairs committee early
today that he would consent to no
compromise on the armed ship issue
and dcBired a direct vote on a resolu
tion warning Americans off armed
ships of belligerent nations. Mr. Flood
took tho president's decision to the
committee.
Report to the administration today
were that yesterday ten members of
the foreign affairs committee wore in
favor of reporting out the McLemore
resolution to warn Americans off arm
ed siilps and nine members were
against it. There are twenty-one
members of the committee Some of
those who expressed opinions were
opposed to the McLemore resolution
because it contains expressions not
connected directly with the Issue on
which the president Insists on a vote.
Flood to Deliver Message.
A meeting of the committee which
was to have been held this morning
was postponed until 3 0 clock UiIb af
ternoon when Chairman Flood will de
liver the president's message. The
president had no engagements with
leaders of house or senate today but
was keeping in constant touch and
prepared to see any members if neces
sary. Up to the present Mr Wilson has
not been asked to see any committee
of either house, to send any facts to
congress, or to appear before con
gress in person as has been informal
ly suggested. It was said at the
White House that no such questions
would be taken up until they were
presented. Administration officials
characterized tho proposed vote of
confidence as "a soft soap" resolution
to endorse the president and at the
same time warn Americans off armed
ships. They reiterated that no such
resolution would be satisfactory.
Clear Cut Issue.
"This is a clear cut issue," said one
administration official, "and wo do
not want It muddled."
There were some indications, ac
cording to these officials, that the
president's stand was having tho de
sired effect on the house They felt
that the rules committee was ready
to act and that the only obstacle now
was in the foreign affairs committee.
In his talk with Representative
Flood today the president said flatly
that what was wanted was a vote on
the McLemore resolution or a similar
one. He made it plain that he wants
the armed ship agitation disposed of
once and for all so It will not come
up later to embarass (the diplomatic
negotiations.

said:
"We have an aristocracy ot the Bos

last of the "character" witnesses for
those opposed to Mr. Brandels, testi
fied that he had talked with more than
fifty members of the Suffolk bar and
only one gave him the Impression that
Mr." Brandels was trustworthy and
honorable.
"How far is the esteem In which
Mr. Brandels is held due to his being
a Jew?" asked Senator Fletcher.
"I didn't know until the last few
years that he was a Jew," the witness
answered.
When Mr Barker appeared to pre
sent his petition, he was asked as to
Mr Brandels' reputation as a lawyer.

front during the night, but that there
were no developments of importance.
The text of the war office's an

"In the region of Verdun the enemy
bombarded violently last night Le
Mort Homme (The Dead Man) at the
Cote de L'Ole. between Malancourt
and Forges as well as tho principal
crossings of the river Meuse. There
was little activity on the part of the
artillery to the east'of the Meuse.
Germans Driven Back.
"In the Woevre district, after an in
tense retaliatory Tire from the artil
lery, the enemy yestorday evening de
livered a spirited attack on our po
sitions at Fresnes. They were at
once driven back by our counter at
tack from the few positions which
they had suceeded in penetrating.
"In the Lorraine district, a bom
bardment of several hours duration
against the Salnte Marie farm west of
Bezange, was followed by an attack,
on the part of the enemy, which re
sulted In. complete failure.
"In Alsace, certain tentative move
ments undertaken by strong German
patrols against our outposts in the
valley of the Lauch, were repulsed by
the use of hand grenades."
Berlin, March 2, via London, 3:15
p. m. The official German statement
of today says the French sacrificed
men unsuccessfully In a counter at
tack on old Fort Douaumont. The
situation on the Franco-Belgian front,
the communication says, Is unchanged.
The text of the statement follows:
'Western front: The situation is
unchanged. In the Yser district the
enemy's artillery was very active.
"On the eastern bank of tho Meuse
the French once more sacrificed
troops in useless counter attacks
against tho fortress of Douaumont.
"Eastern front: On the northern
front there were very spirited adtll
lery engagements at several places.
Gorman field guns made successful

London, March 2, 10:40 a. m. An
Amsterdam dispatch to tho Central
News says that Fort Valx, five miles
to the northeast of Verdun, has heen
destroyed by heavy mortars, accord
ing to unconfirmed German reports,
but that the Germans cannot approach
. the fort as the French have brought
heavy artillery to bear on the ap
proaches. It is added that a German
: battery has been destroyed by French
shells and that the Germans have con
centrated ninety thousand men near
Uuzy who are to resume the offensive
with reinforcements from the Ar-

er Moewa or the cruiser Roon, came
to hand today from South American
soirces. The capture is said to have
been effected by British cruisers
which took their prize to Trinidad, off
the Venezuelan coast. It was a crew
from the Moewe that brought tho Brit
ish steamer Appam a prize into New
port News.
After a lull In infantry operations
In the vicinity of Verdun, since the
early part of tho week! thero has been
a resumption of the German offensive
in the Woevre region. A violent bom
bardment was followed by a spirited
attack on the French at Fresnes, ten
miles southeast of Verdun. Paris re
ports tho driving out of the Germans
from tho few positions which tney
succeeded in penetrating,
Verdun Fight Merely Halted. 1
Tho now attack gives color to what 1
seoms to bo the prevailing military 1
opinion in Paris that the German of-
fenslve at Verdun had merely halted.
It also calls particular attention to i
tho Woevre region where the Teutons t
have advanced along a line south of 1
Fort Douaumont well to the ba.se of t
tho Meuse heights so far as Combres't
twelve miles southeast of Verdun. H
Dispatches from both Berlin and H
Paris point to the difficulties of a fur- H
ther advance in this region. The H
French position, Paris points out, jH
stretch along the heights, from which SH
the ground drops abruptly to 'the jH
Woevre plain with Its moist clay soil, jH
across which the transport of the H
heaviest of the German artillery on jH
ground away from the high roads is H
held to be almost Impossible, while H
the attacking troops would hare to H
deploy in the open under the fire of jH
the French guns on the heights. jH
Berlin commentators, however, ad- jH
vance the view that the Teutons have iH
previously shown that similar disad- jH
vantageous conditions could be sue- H
cessfully met, !H
From Dutch sources come reports jH
that the German drive is to be re- H
sumed from the northeast, 90,000 men H
having been concentrated near Buzy, iH
behind Fort Vaux, which is said to H
have been destroyed by the German H
heavy mortars. H
German Losses Run High. H
Estimates of the German losses in. jH
the offensive are running high in H
entente quarters, one from Paris plac- jH
ing them at between 125,000 and 130,- jH
000. All accounts from German H
sources, however, declared that the !H
casualties of the attacking armies j
were surprisingly small iH

Intact for Counter Attack
When Opportune H
Time Comes.
s Paris, March 1, 11:45 p. m. fDe- H
. layed). The press and public of H
, France are mystified at the continued M
pauses in the German attacks around M
Vorduu. Saution, born of experience, M
leads generally to the rejection of the M
, viow that the Germans have given up tl
all hope of trying to capturo the Lor- JM
, ralue fortress. It is thought more ll
likely they arc merely resting beforo il
starting afresh with greater energy. il
It is believed in many quarters that
the attack on Verdun was only a pre- jl
lhninary to operations on a much jtJI
larger scale for the purpose of try- ll

. firmjcd that General Joffro Is fully pre- 'tl
, pared for all eventualities. So far, jl
only the local French reserves have JH
i been called upon at Verdun, tho great jH
general reserve forces remaining in- ill
tact for use in repelling other heavy 'll
onslaughts, or for carrying out a great !
counter attack when the opportune iH
moment comes. IH
The question is raised as to wheth- '1
er the next German attack will again jH
be at Verdun or along the front from 'H
tho Somme to the Alsne, as it is Jl
known that the Germans havo been 'H
making preparations along the latter IH
lines, tho southern,, limit of which is jl
many miles noarer to Paris than is jH
Verdun. TJiese preparations, hov- 'H
ever, aro not so elaborate as those j
which had been made for Verdun and, iH
should tho Germans attempt the lat- IH
ter plan, tho military observers say iH
they would be liable to a flank at- fH
tack by the British in Artois and Flan IH
ders. 'IH
