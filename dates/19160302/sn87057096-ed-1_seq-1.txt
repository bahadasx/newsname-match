HOTEL CONTRACT LET
fine New Annex to Hotel Leon Will
Make it One of the Best Hotels
in the State of Iowa.
J. R. and P. P. Bowsher, owners of
Hotel Leon, last Saturday let the
contract, for the erection of a tine
annext to the hotel on the lots Just
south of the hotel, which were re
cently purchased, which will extend
the hotel south to the big Bowsher
implement house. A large number
of bidders spent several days in Leon
figuring on the contracts, as the new
improvement will* cost in the neigh
borhood of $15,000, aside from the
.furniture. Sam Anderson, of Albia,
secured the contract for the erection
of the building, Wilson & Martin
dale, of Le6n, the contract for the
beating and plumbing, and Menet'ee
& Carnes, of Trenton, Mo., for the
•electrical fixtures. The annex will
be three stories high, and with the
remodeling of the front on the old
hotel, Leon will have the best hotel
of any town of the size in the state.
Twenty-three new sleeping rooms
•will be added to the hotel, each
equipped with bath, and on the south
aide, extending out over the roof of
the implement house will be a row
of nine sleeping porches, with two
.shower baths, which will be in great
demand during the hot weather. On
the ground floor there will be a bar
ber shop, an office for the Adams Ex
press Company, and private rooms
for Mr. and Mrs. Robert Bowsher,
facing Main street, and several sleep
ing rooms in the rear. The north
ground floor room of the hotel now
used as a writing room and sample
rooms will be converted into a new
.dining room, with kitchen in the
rear and the present dining room
will be used for sample rooms. Work
will be commenced at once on the
new addition, providing a small
hitch in securing deeds to the prop
erty can be arranged, and the annex
is to be completed by July 1st. A
roof garden is also being planned
lor the new annex. Leon is very
fortunate in having the hotel fall
into the hands of the Bowshers, for
they will make of Hotel Leon a hotel
of which the town can boast with
pride.
Ed Fnrquliar Won Cash 1'rize and
Didn't Know It.
Ed W. Farquhar, of Farquhar &
Sons, was considerably surprised
Monday morning when he received a
letter containing a draft for $10
from the P. D. Beckwith estate, the
manufacturers of the famous Round
Oak Stoves and heating Bystems. It
seems ths^t some time ago the com
pany offered a series of prizes for the
salesman who sold the most Round
Oak goods, the contest being divided
up in classes according to tne popu
lation, and -eon was in the class
which covered all towns from 1500
to 3000population. Edhadno thought
of being in the contest but he is al
ways sawing wood, and in the class
he won third place of all the towns
in the United fcuates, which is going
some. The company congratulated
him on winning one of the prizes,
especially as he competed with towns
of the same and larger population all
over the United States and Canada,
and as they say, "this would point
you out as a salesman witn unusual
ability, ano we are sure it will give
you a deep sense of satisfaction to
nave your ability recognized." They
also requested him to write a letter
stating how he accomplished so many
sales, something about the advertis
ing which Farquhar & Sons did, and
a paragraph or two about their store
arrangement, and any other facts of
interest, which they wish to repro
duce in a letter to other dealers for
their instruction. When it comes
to selling goods of any kind Leon is
always in the push, and one of the
best salesmen in the city is Ed Far
quhar, and he works up his sales by
good, consistent advertising, as the
advertisement of Farquhar & Sons
appear in every issue of The Report
er.

A DANDY- GOOD SHOW.
Was the K. of P. Minstrels Present
ed Friday night at the
Opero House.
As predicted the entire house was
sold out last Friday night for the K.
of P. minstrels, every seat being oc
cupied ana many were turned away
unable to secure admittance, and it
was a dandy good home talent enter
tainment from start to finish. When
the curtain raised it was a pleasing
sight which greeted the big audience,
the scene being the Saverlain Cafe,
with an after theatre cabaret. The
stage had been transformed into a
bower of beauty, the scenery being
painted and paper specially for the
attraction, and it looked like a real
cafe, with flowers and hanging bask
ets from the ceiling, while seated at
the tables were a number of ladies
elaborately costumed. After the
opening chorus, Ancil Barry, the
comedian, made a hit with "Rocky
Road to Dublin," followed by Lloyd
Smith with "Araby," and C. B. Simp
son sang "Mother" in a very pleas
ing manner, Lester Hutchinson sang
a tenor solo, "A Little Bit of Heav
en," which was well received. Then
came one of the big features. Vere
Roberts and Marjorie Mullinnix in
"Hello Frisco,"a telephone duet. Mr.
Roberts has a fine voice and did ex
tra well, and Miss Mullinnix surpris
ed the audience with her splendid
voice and pleasing manners. They
were .accompanied by a chorus com
posed of Nancy Kemp, Marcia Wal
lace, Merle Stephens, Ardes Wood
ard and Freda Ferren, and respond
ed to an encore with "Hold Me in
Your Loving Arms," the girl's chor
uus being augmented with a chorus
of boys composed of John Gates, For
est Grimes, Bruce Townsend, Joe
Keshlear, Dewey Long and Lynn
Gardner, and with the girls tl\ey pre
sented a very pretty dancing drill.
The second part was a regular min
strel show, with James Hurst, the
cafe manager as master of cere
monies. Frank Farquhar as usual
was fine with his song, "We'll Have
a Jubilee in My Old Kentucky Home,"
and when on encore he was joined
by little William Akin with a dupli
cate make-up it brought down the
house. "In the Evening by the
Moonlight," by Fred Marvin and "My
Pickaninny Babe," by Lester Hutch
inson followed, and a duet "Water
melon Vine" by Vere Roberts and
Lou Pease with banjo accompani
ment was great. C. W. Reeder sang
"Old Fashioned Melody," and then
that little fellow who can act like a
real negro, Charles" Horn, sang
"Floating Down the Old Green Riv
er," and he sure, .can sing and act
like a darky. "Mrs. Rastus on the
Telephone," a monologue by Fred
Townsend, was a surprise, as his
name did not appear on the program,
but if Fred ever runs out of a job
writing insurance he can easily get
a vaudeville contract. "Magic Melo
dy," by Ancil Barry followed, and
Lou Pease showed real minstrel tal
ent in "When Old Eill Bailey Plays
the Ukalele," the program closing
with "Listen to that Dixie Band," by
C. B. Simpson.
