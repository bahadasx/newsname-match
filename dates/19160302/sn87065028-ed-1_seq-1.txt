Cllf PRIMARY TO
BE
MUNICIPAL EXECUTIVE
COMMITTEE ARRANC
ING FOR CONTEST.
PROBABLY WILL
OCCUR IN APRIL
New Executive Committee will
Be Chosen Synchronously
With Other Officers.
At an early date the local Demo
cratic Municipal Executive Commit
tee will hold a meeting for the pur
pone of calling a primary election
to nominate the elective officials
who are to serve the city of Colum
bus during the biennial period be
, ginning January 1, 1917.
For many years the Lowndes
County Democratic Executive Com
mittee had jurisdiction in municipal
elections and called all contests of
this character, but several months
ago provision for a municipal exec
utive committee was made at a mass
meeting, and the following gentle
men selected to serve thereon;
HELD SOOII
Messrs. E. R. Sherman, P. W. Maer,
T. J. Locke, Jr., W. B. Harris, E. M.
Shropshire. The gentlemen selected
Mr. Sherman as their chairman, and
it is understood that he will Boon
call a meeting of the committee for
the purpose of fixing a date for the
city primary. While no definite an
nouncement regarding a date has
necn made, it is probable that the
primaries will be held some time in
The gentlemen composing tie
committee were not elected at a reg
ular content, having been named by
a mass meeting of citizens he'd at

ions of the law, the qualified electors

'-"Tyrjust as' they vote"on' other city
officials. ThiB will be the first time
that such commissioners have ever
been voted on here, and the new
feature will doubtless lend additional
interest to the primary.
Two candidates, Hon. W. C. Gun
ter and Capt. E. S. Donnell, have
already announced as aspirants for
.' the mayoralty, and the race for the
office promises to be a spirited one.
Mr. Gunter is the present chief ex
ecutive of the city, and has achieved
no little fame by reorganizing the
police force and making persistent
warfare against operators of blind
tigers and other violators of the
law. Capt. Donnell had, up to the
time of his defeat by Mr. Gunter
two years ago, served the people of
Columbus as mayor for nearly a de-
cade, and is generally conceded to
have been one of the most faithful
and efficient chief executives that
the city ever had. Both he and Mr.
Gunter have many 1 warm friends
and loyal supporters, and the contest
.for the office is likely to prove very
close.
There has been some gossip to the
effect that the present councilmen
would all have opposition, but no as
pirants for councilmanic honors
have so far announced, und there is
as yet nothing definite regarding
that phase of the election.
DR. W. G. SANDERS AND MR. C
E. GRIFFIN COME HERE TO
VIEW PLANT.
A committee consisting of Dr. W
G. Sanders and Mr. C. E. Wright,
both of whom are members of the
board of- health at Jackson, Tenn
came here Monday to inspect the lo
cal municipal crematory. Authori
ties at Jackson are thinking of erect
ing a similar plant there, and the two
genlemen came here for the purpose
of looking over our incinirator with
the view of acquainting themselves
with its effectiveness as an agency
for the destruction of garbage and
oifal matter.
I he visitors were met upon am
val by Mayor W. C. Gunter, Coun
cilman D. S. McClanahan, and Drs
J. W. Cox and C. R. Berry, members
' of the local board of health and after
having inspected the crematory
were taken to the Industrial Insti

BILBO KOI 1CEST
OP CHIEF EXECUTIVES
IS IN PATRIARCHAL CLASS AS
COMPARED WITH SEVERAL
FORMER GOVERNORS.
Theodore 0. Bilbo ha been claim
ing to be the youngest man ever elec
ted to the governorship of Mtusisaip
but a Jackson newspaper corres
pondent who believes In giving facts
has earched the records, and find
that Bilbo, when compared to Home
of Mississippi's chief executives, is
really in the patriarchal class. ,
According to the "dope" dug out
by this correspondent in a search
through the department of archives,
no less than eight of Bilbo's prede
cessors were younger than he when
elected to office.
Gov. Bilbo was 38 years old when
he was elected last summer, and his
"youth" was freely commented on,
but research intot he old files at the
state capitol reveals the most Inter
esting fact tha there were several
Mississippi governors younger than
he.
The "baby" of them all was the
very noted W. C. C. Claiborne, the
second governor of the state, who
was appointed by president Jeffer
son in 1801 while Mississippi was
still a territorial district, and who
was just 26 years old when inaugu
rated. And history has it that his
administration was remarkably suc
cessful, he having "imparted new life
into the long dissatisfied and deject
ed people."
Seven other Mississippi governors
were younger men than Governor
Bilbo, the next in youth being Gov.
A. G. Brown, who was 30 years of
age when he became govern
through election in 1841, and after
he had been member of Congrn
and a circuit judge. The Brown ad
ministration, too, is recognized as
being most successful.
Gov. Robt. Williams and Gov.
David Holmes, the third nd fourth
governors, respectively, - were 82
years of age when chosen; Governor
II. G. Runnels was 37, as was Gov.
was 86, Governor Adelbert Ames
was 35, and Gov. R. C. Powers, the
same age, while Gov. J. J. McRae
was just turning 39 when elected.
As a matter of fact the records
show that most Mississippi governors
were comparatively young men, the
oldest having been Gov. W. L,
bharkey, who went into office , at
the age of 68 amid the stormy times
of the year 1865.
The following list shows the ages
of Mississippi governors at the time
of their inauguration: Winthrod Sar

Thj theory thr.t the unknowii ir.an
killed in a wreck on the Mobile anil
Ohio rail road near Buhl, Ala., on
February 21, was Harry East, the
famous Alabama felon, was effect
ually dissapated Tuesday when Chief
Morton received from R. L. John
ston, warden of the Alabama state
prison at Wetumpka, a letter in
which a minute description of EHst
is given. The Alabama criminal, so
the letter states, has several tattoo
marks upon his body, while the ca
daver of the man killed near Buhl is
perfectly free from blemishes of
this character.
Thousands of people have viewed
the cadaver, which has laid at the
undertaking establishment of Gun
ter Brothers on College street for
more than a week, but while several
attempts at identification have been
made, all clues, when run down by
officers working on the case, proved
to be worthless. M. P. Richardson,
a Jocal laundryman, stated that he
saw the unknown man in Denver,
Colorado, last December, at which
time he was working for the May
Clothing Company, but a telegram
sent to that firm failed to' bring a
response. Later a, former Alabamian
said he believed the man to be Harry
East, and then there came along
another would-be identifier who said
he was practically certain that the
body, was that of a mn ramed Grif
fin, who formerly lived in Meridian.
In each instance dilligent effort to
establish identification was made,
but all failed.
The body is still at the undertak
ing tstablishment, no arrangements
for burial having as yet been made.
W. C. T. U. to Meet.
The W. C. T. U. will hold a meet
ing at the home of Mrs. Sue Stinson
on South Sixth street, this afternoon
at 3:30 o'clock. All interested are
invited to attend.
The many friends of Mrs. Warren
M. Cox regret to hear of her illness
at her home in South Columbus.
Mrs. Mary Ervin's countless
friends hope soon to hear of her re
covery after an illness of several
days.

A STATIC PARDON
BOARD CREATED
House Passes Bill Providing
for Support of Confederate
Hospital at Vicksburg.
Jackson, Miss., l ib. 29. After a
stirring de'mte In the Senate which
lusted more than time hours today,
House Bill No. 2.V, Wnch is called
"ana ct to promote temperance and
suppress ths evil of intemperance,
to prevent the advertising of vinom,
malt, intoxicating or spirituous
liquors, or intoxicating bitters," etc.,
or, as colloqually known, the anti
whiskey advertising bill, passed that
body by a close vote of 22 to 17. The
consideraton of the bill was aeco?n
panied by the presentation of sever
al amendments, the purpose of which
was to weaken its effect, but all ex
cept one were voted down.
The one amendment that got by
was offered by Mr. Crawley, of At
tala, which would seek to prevent the
circuit clerks or other officials of the
counties or cities in the state from
preparing and sending out to liquor
houses and distilleries lists of quali
fied voters. Discussion of this amend
ment took a wide range. In fact, it
brought the whole measure and its
purpose into review, and at times the
discussion almost bordered on the
acrimonious.
Opponents of the measure still
have a fighting chance to defeat the
bill, ns it is held on a motion to re
consider, though it is probable that
these efforts will be abortive.
As to be expecSnl, the prohibition
ists and reformer had the gratifica
tion of speaking to well-filled galler
ies, with many ministers and ladies
included in the group of lookers-on.
After a hearty round of applause
wnun greet ea tno first winning
point by the prohibitionists, Senator
Whittington, in charge of the bill,
appealed from the galleries to re
frain from such manifestations. He
declared it was "to the calculation
and judgement of the Senate who
must determine the questions at is
sue, und not to the visitors, that the
proponents of this bill a redirecting
their efforts," which appeal was ef
fective.
The House passed the bill for the
support of the Confederate Veteran's
Hospital Annex at Vicksburg with
out amendment, and also the Jack
son Charity Hospital support bill.
Neither of these institutions had ask
ed for any increase above the appro
priations of UM4.
After some debate, the House
passed a bill creating a state board
of pardons, which has been pending
for some time. This is one of the
planks in the platform of Governor
Bilbo, and is a plan which has long
been before the people of Mississippi,
and it is thought that it will pass the
Senate without much trouble. The
House voted overwhelmingly for the
bill 87-10.
The House committee on appro
priations reported adversely on a bill
appropriating $1,500 to be given the
Jackson Fire Department as a meas
ure of compensation for protection
of state property within the capita!
city. This has been a part of every
appropriation budget which h;s
passed hitherto, but then this Leg
islature and this House is different,
and nothing that it does or fails to
do excites surprise. The iconoclapti;
spirit has been manifest from the
first week, or since the standing com
mittees were appointed.
Gov. Bilbo sent a sealed message
to the Senate containing the names
of his appointees to the board of
Commissioners of tho upper, or Va-zoo-Mississippi
Delta Levee District.
Until the Senate meets in executive
session to consider these nominations
the governor, of coarse, declines to
make the names of these 12 men
public.

Sunset Hour," will be given on the

Instruction will Begin When
Students Next Assemble.
Sponsors of the free nii;ht school
are very much gratified at the pros
pective success of the laudable un
dertaking, which hail its firt ses
sion Tuesday night, when clergymen
and educators gathered at Franklin
Academy, which is to be the domicile
of the institution, to bid the students
welcome and to assure them of
hearty co-operation and as,istance
in the efforts which they have de
termined to make to fit themselves
for more useful lives by increasing
their store of knowledge.
Several addresses marked the
opening of the school, among the
speakers having been Dr. J. L. Vip-
perman, pastor of the first Baptist
church, Dr. W. L. Duren, pastor of
the First Methodist church, Prof.
W. V. Frierson, superintendent of
public schools, Miss Helen Hutch-
craft, secretary of the Young Wom
en's Christian Association at the
Industrial Institute and College, and
Prcf. C. S. Brooks, one of the in
structors at the same institution.
Prof. Frierson, Prof. Brooks and
Miss Hutchcraft are members of
the night school faculty, and their
remarks were almost wholly confin
ed to an outline of the character of
instruction which they intend giving.
Dr. Vipperman and Dr. Duren spoke
words of encouragement to the stu
dents, reminding them of the fact
that a savant has supiently said that
"education ends only with life," and
assuring them that none of us ever
grow too old to learn.
It was impossible for Rev. W. S.
Slack, rector of St. Paul's Episcopal
diui'h, who was largely instrumen
tal to establishing the school, to tie
preset at the inaugural session, as
he was called out of the ciyt last
week and has not yet returned. Had
he been in attendance, however, he
would have doubtless felt pardona
ble pride in the success of the und'r
taking, as there were 37 pupils pres
ent, und this erollment is considered
unusually large for a city with a
population no greater than that of
Columbus.
('lasses were organized Friday
night, and instruction will begin at
the next regular session, which will
be held Friday night, with semi
weekly sessions thereafter until the
close of the winter.

IMNOVII IN imrUTE WITfl

HOURS or WOKIC.
According to newsp-t r.rVt.
a tllute between railroad cffumln
and employees retarding pity m
workmir hours which U no in dv
grs thieatrns to tie up many ril
lines throughout the country, acd
the ones in tin immediate section
appear to be Included in thou to
which such darner is imminent. (Vim
meriting upon the threatened strike,
the Memphis Commercial-Appeal, in
a i cit-tit issue, prints the following:
Engineers, firemen, conductors,
trainmen and switchmen on every
railroad running into Memphis are
now voting on a set of demands
which their brotherhoods have pre
parod for submission to every rail
road in the country, and Memphis
business men are fearful that this
territory in common with the re
mainder of the United States may
suffer from a general railroad strike
in case employees fail to get what
they want.
The railroads say they cannot pos
sibly pay the increased wages for
which the demands call and brother
hood leaders have been quoted as
saying there will be no arbitration,
as the result of which business in
terests throughout the country have
become alarmed.
The brotherhood demands are that
eight hours shall constitute a day's
work in all freight, yard and host
ling service and that time and a half
shall be paid fur overtime.
The vote on the demands has been
in progress all over the country for
some weeks and is expected to be
completed at an early date. It is
generally thought that the men will
approve the demands and that they
will be presented to the railroads
early in March.
Nothing can be learned as to the
vote in different communities or on
individual lines, as the vote is to be
counted as a whole and all are to
abide by the result of the majority.
After the demands 1ve been pre
sented the railroads must reply in 30
days!
Leaders of the brotherhoods say
that the movement is for an eight
hour day and are claiming support
for it on humantarian grounds.
Railroad officials, on the other
hand, contend that the men do not
sincerely desire a real eight hour
working day, but are merely seek
ing to change the basis for comput
ing a day's pay in order that they
may get material increases in their
wages and in support of this they
point out that under the present con
ditions railroad employees consist
ently prefer the longer runs requir
ing longer hours of service, but giv
ing correspondingly higher pay.
Railroud statisticians have estima
ted that the increase in wages for
members of the four brotherhoods in
the entire country, should the de
mands be granted, would run above
a hundred million dollars and in this
connection they also claim that their
members, the engineers, firemen,
conductors, switchmen, and brake-
men are already the highest paid
men in the railroad service and
among the highest paid classes of la
bor in the world and that they have
in recent years received great in
creases in their compensation.
So great would these increases be
for many lines, it is claimed, they
would be absolutely unable to pay
them unless they could succeed in
getting the Interstate Commerce
Commission, and various other state
commissions to grant them increases
in their rates for transporting freight
and passengers.
This is at best a long drawn out
process with the chances of succeti'
very doubtful, and it is not very like
ly to prove extremely popular, us the
public in the end would, of course,
have to pay the bill. At least this
is the railroad view, and it is gener
ally believed that, holding this opin
i ion. the railroads will feel themselves
unable to meet the demands
of
the men and will refuse them.
This would bring the controversy
to the stage of mediation or arbitra
tion, and it is just here that the trou
ble lies, for railroad men are fearful
that the brotherhood leaders plan
to abandon peaceful methods snd en
deavor to enforce their demands by
a nation-wide strike, which would be

HO VERDUN LESSENS
FRENCH ARTILLERY USED TO
PREVENT FURTHER AD
VANCES ON FORTS.
London, Feb. i. With the les
sening of the activity of the con
tending forces to the north of Ver
dun, the French in the Woevre
region east of Verdun, are 'l.-ing
their artillery to break up German
preparations for further advances
toward the fortress. At various
points the fire of the French has
prevented the Germans from laurel
ing offensives.
In the Vosges there has also been
great artillery activity by the French
near Senones and Ban-De-Sapt, and
near Seppois the Germans have been
driven out of trenches they haJ
previously taken.
The Germans have auded r.event
additional points to their terrain in
the fighting about Verdun, having
been enabled to construct trenches
on the slopes north of the Cote D-i-Poivre
and to capture an armored
work northwest of Douaumont and
to have taken the towns of Minhul
les and Champion, i miles south
east of Verdun. '
In this drive to the east of Verdun
the advance of the Germans has ex
tended over a front virtually 13
miles, from Dieppe to Champion.
