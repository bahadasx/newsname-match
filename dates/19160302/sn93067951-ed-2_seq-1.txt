Inspired by the presence of '
their Emperor and led by Crown J
Prince Frederick William, the
Herman troops are engaged in j
cue of the greatest battles of the t
war on the western front, ceti- s
tering around the fortress of z
Verdnn. Attack has followed
^attack against the French line t
^after bombardments incessant d
and terrific, continuing)for sever- a
ul days. e
While the Germans have not a
been able, despite the rain of i
shells and furious onslaughts by t
the infantry, to break the fi
French line, nevertheless the I
French on their right and left
wings nave oeen compelled to
withdraw their lines, respective- ii
ly to the south of Ornes and be- t
hind the town of Samogneux, 8
six miles north of the fortress. t
The German attack on this 8
French stronghold his becomeone p
of the chief operations of the war. d
It is tho first t fl'ort since the C
original drive of the German o
armies to break through the G
main line of the French and n
strike for Faris?for there can G
be little doubt, that Fans would
become the objective if Verdun ei
were captured and the French t<
defpnse at that point broken, h
The position is one of the strong- T
i' est in Euiope, and, perhaps, the R
strongest on the western front, tl
The Germans are making a real- li
ly desperate effort to capture it, w
and uiready have paid a heavy m
price tor the initial success they T
have had, and they have made R
n?? me re than a dent in the rim f

Fleeing Youth Shot
By Rural Policeman
Last Thursday afternoon while
running from Rural Policeman
E. W. Moore, stationed at Mc
Bee, Jonn Boan, a youth of 17
years, was shot through the face
and seriouslay injured.
It seems that young Boan had
bought a bicycle in Camden and
moved from there to Chesterfield
county before payments on
the wheel were completed. A
warrant for his arrest was issued
and forwarded for execution to
Mr. Moore.
When Moore was looking for
the lad he is said to have met
him in the road and not knowing
him, asked him where young
Boan could be found. Receiving
an evasive reply, Moore asked
a woman nearby the same
question and was told that that
was Boan to whom he was talkMoore
is said to have turned
and started after the boy, who
took to his heels, when the policeman
is alleged to have fired,
and Boan fell seriously wounded.
In extenuation Mr. Moore.

in time to receive the ball in his
lower jaw. It took an upward
course and emerged through the

The boy received first aid from

Huntley?Clark
The marriage Mrs. Ella Clark
to Mr. James A Huntley at the
home of Mr. W A. Douglass last

Mrs. Huntley is the daughter

leader in the social and church
life of her community, and a
young lady of veiy attractive
personality.
Mr. Huntley is one of the most
progressive young farmers of the
county.
Soon after the ceremony the
happy couple left for Charlotte

their return they will mak<'
their homo on Mr. Hunt leys
