ED. LftWDER HAS URGE HERD
Haa Taken Step to Procure a Model
Herd of Holsteia Cowa at
His Farm.
SEES FUTURE OF DAIRYING
At the Bead of His Held is Paul
Rector De KoL a Bull EUgibls
to Registration.
To those who may be the least
skeptical about the possibilities of
profitable dairying for Audrain Coun-
a change ot opinion is certain to
follow a visit to LawsScTOnle Fana.
Less than one year ago this place pre
sented a typical abandoned farm ap
pearance. Acres formerly tilled and
considered productive had grown up
to second growth hickory, locust and
buck bush. Fences and buildings were
greatly depreciated and rapidly de-
tenorating.
But the owner of the farm saw an
opportunity to secure a mixed herd of
cows at a reasonable price. This de
cided the case that an almost hopeless
farm should take a try at dairying, as
last resort. With two more years of
freedom from destructive disease this
farm and herd will have an estab
lished reputation as a very highly
profitable milk producing place. In
addition, it will be in position to com
mand unusual prices for young stock.
The critical period for any industry
is the time it is becoming established.
This is doubly true of dairying. But
Lawderdale Holsteins are now an es
tablished fact
The herd consists of 39 mature cows
20 of which represent very high grade
Ilolstein stock. A daily record of
production for the best cows is kept,
and has been of assistance in indicat
ing the boarders which will be weeded
out eventually. Likewise, calves of the
highest producers may thus receive
special attention.
At the head of this herd is Paul
Rector De Kol, a Holstein bull elig
ible to registration, sired by the fam
ous Nebraska Experiment Station
Bull, old Rector De Kol. His dam
was Mexico Daisy who averaged
about 85 pounds of milk per day in
full flow, or about 9 gallons. The
calves from the cross of this bull on
the above cows should show an aver
age increase in animal production
over their dams of about $10.00 per
bead. '
IrT-oddition to the aged stock, there
are 29 yearling heifers which repre
sent an initial cost to their owner of
about one-third their value next spring
when they drop their first calves.
These heifers are all grade black and
whites, and many of them are from
dams of known production.
Best dairy practice secures fall
freshening cows, which in the method
in a large measure followed with the
Lawderdale herd. Of this year's crop
of calves, fully 20 females will go to
increase the production of the herd by
reolacing low producing boarder cows.
total of 82 calves will bo secured.
These are raised on calf meal so that
all the milk can be marketed through
the Rock Spring Dairy.
Mr. Ed Lawder, proprietor of Law
derdale Farm, desires to have a pro
ducing herd of 48 Holstein cows. This
spring he will bead his stock with a
registered bull from high producing
and testing ancestry. He estimates
that two years from this spring his
herd will number 260 head of cattle
when he will be in position to advertise
a very creditable sale of surplus Hol
stein young stuff and aged cows.
For this winter's feeding, a silo
18x30 feet of 168 tons capacity was
filled last fall. Mixed hay was the
best that -could be provided, but for
the next season, cow pea hay will -be
grown. The grain feed consists of
three portions bran, two corn, and
one cotton seed meat) which takes a
balanced ration with the available
roughage. One pound of grain is fed
for each 3 Vi pounds of milk.
One reason why this farm will be
successful when others might have
failed, is that capital has been In
vested in productive stock, rather
than non-producing improvements.
With registered stock and cumulative
profits, the improvements can be se
cured.
Mr. Lawder states that although he
knew little about milk cows and dairy-

FM SOT GIVE BOND IS-"
SUE FOR SEPTIC Tins
City Attorney Does Not Know Wheth
er City Has Power to Issue Bonds
In This Case.
2 NEW ORDINANCES DEFEATED
Electric Line Waa Ordered to Remove
Spur Track From Western
Avenue Soon.
If a bond issue is voted on for two
septic tanks costing the city $16,000,
it is the belief of City Attorney David
H. Robertson, that it must be done
at a special election in order to make
the boncU valid. .
City Attorney Robertson said be
fore the Council Monday evening
that he waa doubtful whether a bond
issue could be submitted for building
septic tanks. In other places these
tanks are paid for by a special assess
ment .
On motion of Councilman Ballew
the Mexico and Santa Fe electric line
was ordered to remove its spur track
between Jackson and Promenade
streets on Western avenue; They
were also ordered to stand and load all
cars in their yards on Jaskson street
The spur track which the electric
line has used ever since its existence,
according to members of the council,
is not included in the line's franchise,
and many of the citizens of this part
of the city have complained.
On April the 4th, at the general
city election, a vote on the library tax
will be submitted. A petition includ
ing one hundred and nine names was
presented to the council Monday
night asking for this action. The
vote is to apportion a seven-tenths of
mill tax from the city revenue to
support the Library. This in no way
will increase the rate of taxation at
present and simply makes it possible
to maintain the library.
The ordinances, one pertaining to
hawkers and venders and the other to
gaming devices, were defeated upon
their third reading Monday night;
The council explains this action by
saying that the present ordinances
cover the cases fully.
Judge Lewis .chairman of the
claims committee, presented bills to
the amount of (89.00 which were
allowed. On motion of E. L. John.
son worthless taxes were stricken
from the tax books. This means
taxes made worthless by deaths and
erronfous assessments.
. The amount of the taxes charged
off of the tax books was $2,490. This
represented the accumulations of the
last fifteen years. This was taken out
of the poll, sewer and general revenue
fund. This action of the council was
taken at the suggestion of the city at
torney. -

umbia Tribune says:
The executive committee of the
club met in St Louis this week and
pontponed the meeting at Mexico un

nitely when James E. Boggs, of Col
umbia, who is a member of the ex
ecutive committee and vice-president
of the oragnization, told the com
mittee that Columbia was going to
hold its annual Jefferson Day ban
quet on April 13 and suggested that
the Young Men's Democratic Gub
meet at Columbia on that date. The
committee agreed and the same pro
gram that was to have been carried
out at Mexico will be carried out
here.
All candidates for state office will
establish headquarters here on that
date and particularly the candidates
for governor. All will be here and
on the afternoon of April 13, the sev
en candidates for governor if there
be not more at that time will address

REPUBLICAN ELECT DELEGATES
Elected Delegates to Twa State Con
ventions. Delegates to the Ninth District
Republican convention at Warren ton,
March were elected Saturday at
the meeting of the Republicans in the
Court House.. Walter Boyd, F. K.
Sanfard, E W. Rockwell, Harry Har
vey and J. F. Johnson, were named
as delegates to this convention.
Delegates to the stats convention
which will be held at Excelsior Springs
are: Dr. J. C. Parriah, E. C. Kennen,
R. R. Buckuer, Clarence A. Barnes, J.
A. Gunnell and H. E. Christrup.
They were Instructed to vote for T.
W. Huckreide and i. C. Brown, as
delegates to the national convention
from the Ninth ;.itrict Former
Gov. Herbert S. Hadley, J. L. Babler,
L. C. Dyer, and John C. McKinley were
indorsed as delegates at large.
E. S. Wilson waa elected chair
man and Ralph Head was elected
secretary of the permanent organiza
tion in this city.
The sentiment of all the leaders
was expressed openly for Lamm for
Governor, though no attempt was
made- to put over a resolution of in
dorsement How Lamm's candidacy
will be taken by the Republicans of
the county, in view of the marked
opposition to the Scdalia man by E.
F.Jones, head "of the Republican
wing of the Anti-Saloon League, is a
matter of considerable speculation.
There also was strong Hughes-
f or-President sentiment W. W.
Braden, of Laddonia, one of the moat
active Republicans in the County,
and Kenneth G. Keanen, an attorney j
of Laddonia, who was identified with
the Stand-Pat wing in 1912, said the
Republicans, who attended the coun
ty meeting, favored Hughes though no
official indorsement was given.
Resolutions adopted follow :
"Be it resolved, we the Republicans
of Audrain County in mass cenvention
hereby indorse Uie ' jn-ecepts of the
Republican Party and its splendid
National record beginning with the
time of Lincoln down to the disastrous
change of administration in 1912.
"Be it also resolved that we indorse
the theory of protective tariff as pro
pounded by the Republican Party. It
is our opinion that a non-partisan tar
iff Commission, which will remove the
tariff discussion from sectional pol
itical consideration as far as possible,
is the true way of determining the
tariff question. .
Be it resolved also that we are
anxious to return to a period of pros
perity such as prevailed during the
Republican administrations of the
past We also desire the elimination
of the peaceful War Tax made neces
sary by the mismanagement of the
present national administration.
"Aa to State matters, we respect
fully call your attention to a'compan-
son of the present administration to
that of the preceding one and desire
that you make yodr choice as to which
has been the most efficient in the man
agement of our State affairs.
We feel the theory of Nepotism
is entirely contrary to the best in
terests of the State and should be
eliminated.
"We deplore the general incompe
tency of the present State adminis
tration and specially direct your at
tention to the over-appropriation of
the State funds, by the last Legisla
ture and its attempt to conceal the
same by the school fund grab as at
tempted by the Democratic State of
ficials. - ;
"We also believe laws now on the
Statute Books regarding prison labor
should be. enforced. We also oppose
the creation of offices for the sole
purpose of rewarding the faithful, at
a heavy expense to the taxpayers of
the State.
"Also, be it resolved, delegates to
the Congressional Convention are
hereby instructed to cast their vote
for Judge Hukreide and Hon. J. C.
Brown as delegates to the National
Convention to be held in Chicago
June 7, 1916, and we also instruct
delegates to the State Convention to
be held at Excelsior Springs April 6,
to cast their votes for Hon. Herbert

A. B. Lambert, of St Louis, Writes
the Mexico Commercial Club That
Application ia on File. -
CONGRESS MAY RAISE FUNDS
Will Give Exhibition Here and Also
Offers to Organize Signal Corps
in This City.
Mexico has on file an application
for an aviation squad of the Missouri
National Guard. The matter will like
ly be definately acted upon by Con
gress during the present session and
an appropriation made to finance this
department of the organization. The
following letter from A. B. Lambert,
of St Louis ,an aviation enthusiast
to secretary R. E. Race, of the Mex
ico Commercial Club, explains the ex
act status of matters.
"In reply to your letter of Febru
ary 21:
"A law was passed by Congress
several years ago permitting the Avi
ation Division of the regular Army to
land aeroplanes and train officers of
the National Guards " of various
states. However, Congress has failed
to provide sufficient funds which
would permit the loan of machines,
for the simple reason that the Army
has not over five first-class' aero
planes and these are in daily use .to
train their own officers. We hope,
however, that Congress will be more
generous the forthcoming year and
even take up the question of supply
ing aeroplanes and equipment direct
to the National Guards.
'As soon as something concrete
happens along these lines, I will in
form you. In the meantime, I will
consider you have made application
for this service. There is not jnuch
chance for materialization for a long
time, nevertheless it might keep up
the interest in your city.
"Another thing we are collecting
money here for the purpose of buying
several aeroplanes. When this is ac
complished, I will arrange to have
an exhibition for you and will assist
your company to organize a Signal
Corps, something very few of our
State Companies have.

WILSON ATTEMPTED SUICIDE.
Murderer of Two in Pike County
Shot Woman First
Bowling Green, Mo., March 1.
Vance Wilson, a patent-medicine
vender, was brought to the Pike
County jail here yesterday -on a
charge of slaying Mr .and Mrs. Frank
Snedager near Spencerburg Mon
day. Wilson, according to William
Craign ,a neighbor of the Snedage'rs, !
haa confessed.
Mrs. Snedager was a first cousin of
Wilson. Trouble between Wilson and
Snedager began about a year ago
when Snedager ordered Wilson off his
place. ' '
Craigin's story of what Wilson told
him cleared much of the mystery
which had surrounded the case. It
differs materially from earlier re
ports which received here.
When Wilson, according to bis re
puted confesison, reached the Sned
ager home, the two Snedager children
6 and 8 years old girls, were playing
on the porch.
"Where's your father?" he asked.
Shoots Woman as She Opens Door
On being told he was in the bam, he
knocked on the door. .When Mrs.
Snedakcr opened it she jas shot 3
times in the forehead.
Mrs. Snedager managed to fores
the door shut and lock it. Then she
crawled to the telephone.
"I'm shot dying," she cried to her
mother.- Then she fell to the floor,
too weak to stand. She crawlnd into
another room, again locking the door.
The girls, in the meantime, ran to
the barn and caller their father.
Running toward the house, he was
met by the slayer, who shot him
twice, killing him instantly.
Wilson, according to the reputed
confession, went back to the bouse,
battered down both doors and shot
Mrs. Snedager a fourth time, killing
her.
Craigin, summoned by Mrs. Sneda-
ger's mother, ran to the house just as
Wilson was departing.
Slayer Sought to End Life.
"Lord, Van, you didn't come home
to do this dirty work?" Craigin ask
ed Wilson. v
"Yes, I did, and I made a good job
of it, too," Craigin says Wilson re
plied.
Wilson, it is said, then reloaded his
pistol and made a move as if going
to end his own life. Craigin persuad-
ed him to go to the home of his moth
er. '
He remained there and surrendered
to Sheriff W. P. Hawkins on his ar
rival. 13 DRY ft SAPPINGTON.
