City Executive to Lay Finan
cial Problems Before Super
visors in Important Message
PUBLICITY PROPOSED TO
LET VOTERS KNOW FACTS
. - " ,
If Special Called, Will Be Pre
ceded By Public Meetings;
. Estimate of Issue From
$500,000 to $750,000
Faced with the-necessity for large
cdditlonal funds for permanent rpad
Improvement and with the growing de
mand for a city hall worthy of Hono
lulu, the municipal administration has
'virtually, decided upon a bond. issue
of half a million or more as the im
itative result of the situation..
v Mayor Lane made announcement to
the Star-Bulletin this morning that
vjihm'R few. weeks he will lay before
. the board of supervisors a. message
recommending: a bond issue of $500.
XiuO or 1750,000, to be voted upon by
the people of the city, and the pro
ceeds of which are to go for two spe
cific purposes, road work and the erec
tion pf a city halL ;
Three important pieces of perma
nent road construction are to be done
from the' 1 proposed . bond moneys.
First Is the completion of the present
belt road system and putting it into
perfect shape. The other two are new
belt road stretches to combine with
the present system. One is by way
the Walanae branch which has been
often discussed, v. : . :
Z' "We want to .make it possible for
autoists and others to get around any
part of the island on perfect roads,"
said the mayor today. ...
He it very emphatically In favor of
early action to build a new city hall.
City Hall Needed; , - ,- "
"At the present time our officers
are scattered between .several build
ings and we are paying more In rent
than would be sufficient to defray the
interest or the bonds, he points out
VThe -first consideration, however, Is
that Honolulu's growth as a city, our
place in the racific ocean and our In-
creasing importance as a welcoming
city for visitors, make It necessary
that the municipal heme be one of
imposing appearuice and commodious
arrangement .
r "Honolulu's progress will be retard
1 ed until we have a city hall to which
e can point with pride."
- He announces tnat from present
prospects the Gore lot, at tne junc
tion of King and Merchant streets,
v ill be secured if loesible. Govern oi
IMnkham favors this as part of the
civic center plans and the mayor is re
lvinr iron the roYernor's cood offices
in ofTot snrriA land ctihinr that will
let the city secure this property at a
favorable figure. Thus it is hoped to
. put all the more money into the build
ing itself. .
"We should build a city hall costing
not less than $ 250,000," he states.
"There has been some advocacy of
putttng the city hall on the Mahuka

v Sugar in New York today jumped

$100.40 per, ton to $105.40 Shortage

'. With the exception that Guy D. Ran-
dell probably will be tried on a charge
of attempting to recruit soldiers out
of the local army forces for enlist
ment with the Allies, the federal offi
cials consider the socalled "var plot"'
case virtually closed, v I
Randell, who pleaded guilty before
the commissioner, George S. Curry, Is
still confined In Oahu prison. ; :, : ,
"In my opinion," said District At
torney Horace W. Vaughan today,
'Randell himself used the ; name
'Hawkshaw,' and there is no such per
son by that name connected with the
case.. " ' f '. . ?- .";-':)
r The name' "Haw kshaw" was signed
on a $10 check which, according to
testimony, was to be used, to purchase
a man out of the army.
. The word 'Hawkshaw, as written,
by Randell yesterday, is identical with
the 'Hawkshaw on the check," is the
information volunteered by District
Attorney Vaughan. . 1
M r. Vaughan added emphatically
that there Is no ''war plot";; as far as
he' has been able to learn, v MWe will
try Randell on the charge for which
he is now held, and perhaps others."
he added. I know of no other arrests
likely to be made right away, and I
know of no persons engaged In any
so-called 'war plots' here." !
Randell, In his testimony yesterday,
said that Hawkshaw, who he declared
was a wealthy Australian farmer, was
staying at the Moana hotel prior to
the opening of the Carnival. The Mo
ana today stated that no person by J
tne name or Haw&snaw was ever reg
istered there. Randell further stated
that Hawkshaw left Honolulu last Sat
urday night on either the Great Nor
thern or Northern Pacific. That name,
however,' did not appear on either
passenger list . . ' '
A meeting of the federal grand jury
will be called early In April, at which
time Randell's tase probably will be
taken up.
Details of yesterday afternoon's
hearing will be found on Page 10 to-

ALL JURY TRIALS

FORCED TO HALT
Territorial Courts Paralyzed
- Until July By Exhaustion of
of Funds on Hand
COURT OFFICIALS FACE
JAIL IF THEY GET BUSY
Only Act of Legislature Can
Help, Says Carden; Super
visors are Powerless
. Unless conditions are altered or spe
cial legislation is passed, there will be
no further meetings of territorial trial
or grand juries until after June 30.
Imprisonment; or at least a substan
tial fine, faces the members of the
board of supervisors if they financially
assist the local circuit court in excess
of the $14,500 appropriation for, the
period ending June 30 next unless
they can find some way .of obtaining
the money without exceeding their in
come for 1916.
If any court officials proceed now to
spend money in the absence of an ap
propriation by the supervisors, or in
excess of the $14,500 appropriation for
the present fiscal period, they are li
able to find - themselves In trouble
akin to that facing the city fathers.
"This." said City Attorney Carden
today, referring to the foregoing state
ments, "is. what tne supervisors and
the courts are up against"
Money Is All Spent
Because ; the . courts have run
through the expense appropriation
made by the supervisors, amounting to
$14,300 which "was to last until June
20 next, there Is now no money avail
able with r which they may purchase
supplies or pay the fees of grand or
trial jurors, or the, mileage of wit
nesses called before these tribunals.
As Attorney Carden put it today, the
supervisors are "broke"; they are fi
nancially unable .to assist the courts
from a money standpoint.;
For 5 the reason that no' money, is
available, ; a,.tneetlng; o! the ,'terf ltorial
