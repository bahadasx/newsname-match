Valley City Winner in
Sunday Sdiool Contest
Valley City won in the contest with
Williston. At first it appeared that
Williston had won, but a checking up
of the records showed that six new en
rollments had not been counted for the
Valley City Sunday school.
The record of the Valley City Con
gregational school Sunday was as fol
lows: Attendance 429, offering, $19,
perfect classes 17—this included the
entire primary department and many
of the adult classes new scholars en
rolled 28. Williston had an attendance
of 401, offering of $26.34, 10 perfect
classes and new scholars to the num
ber of 67. This closes the two months'
contest, Valley City beating by 17
points. Each of the schools has more
than doubled duriiig the period. For
the next eight weeks the schools will
keep in touch with one another each
week. The interest on each side will
be to note how permanent this rapid
growth has been.

Large Audience Heard
Prof. Wemett's Address
The address on Sunday evening at
the Congregational church by Prof. W.
M. Wemett on "Preparedness" was lis
tened to with interest by a large audi
ence. Prof. Wemett is a very able
speaker and an interesting one,
and his address was well received.
Although all his hearers might not
share his opinions relating to the sub
ject, yet none could fail to see the
logic of many of the ideas advanced.
The question is a deep one, involving
many interests and there are many
points plain to these who are in a po
sition to know the needs of the nation
that the casual reader or observer
knows but little about) and it is only
through the thorough discussion of
these subjects that a right and just
solution of the problem can be
brought about. Whether everyone
agrees with Prof. Wemett or not, it is
certain that they have had arguments
brought up before them which they
cannot lay lightly aside, but which
prove food for thought.

Mrs. Frank Koeslin died at 5:20
Tuesday morning at Riverside hospi

from cancer. About a year ago she
was operated on and received tempor

born in Germany 51 years ago and was
married to Frank Koeslin Jan. 3, 1890,
coming to Barnes county in April,
1892, and has resided on the farm

runner of another period of watchful

The fact that the department is ad

dence that the time has arrived for ac

April 6, and the time is so near at
hand it may be possible that construc

is mere conjecture, but it is enough
to shout about to know that they have
"started something."
The business of the Valley City post
office has been a revenue producer for
the government for several years, and
it is nothing more than right that the
patrons ibe given adequate accommo
dations. In fact the business here has
outgrown the present quarters to such
an extent that a change was impera
tive. A new building will be a wel
come addition to the business section
of the city.
The citizens of the community are
to be congratulated upon securing
such an evident necessity. It can not
be definitely stated who should get the
credit for the consummation of the
enterprise, but we know that our con
gressmen have been urging the propo
sition at Washington, the people have
done their share of kicking, and the
newspapers have constantly been say

When the building is dedicated and
opened for service it will be a red let

and write. It will be a time for con
gratulation and celebration.
Let's do our part to hasten the time*
