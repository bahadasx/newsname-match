MISSOURI PACIFIC
SLIPSJNE OVER
Makes Reduction of Rates Which
Other Roads Cannot Meet for
a Month.
TO MISSOURI AND KANSAS
The Missouri Pacific has put one
over on the other railroads that are
competitors for the Kantms and Mis
souri passenger business from
Omaha. It has cut the rates from
Omaha to Kansas and Missouri
points and from these "points Into
Omaha. Its competitors are trying
to figure out how this was done, but
it was done, and all day the city of
fice in Omaha has been selling
straight commercial tickets at a cut
of very close to Vi cent per mile.
Two days ago the local office re
ceived a new passenger rae tariff, a
tariff Issued from the general of
fices at St. Louis February 2o. This
tariff provided for the reduction of
rates and bore the announcement
that the rates would be effective
March 1.
When the Missouri Faclflo city ticket
office opened for business, to all parties
desiring tickets from Omnha Into Kan
sas, or Missouri, a tariff rate consider
ably lower than offered by any other road
was made.
The Burlington people had expected
to put In a rate that wonld be In line
with that of the Mlasourt raclflc, but
according to the rules of the Interstate
Commerce commission, thla cannot he
applied until March 13, thirty days from
tha date of the filing of the notice to
reduce. They admit that In some " way
the Missouri Pscifio people have slipped
one ever on them and have' got their
rate ' in working order. ' v.S-ii"':.
, Iatcjratate Baaiaoe.
.The reduced rate la no way an Intra
state proposition, having to do entirely
With Interstate points. ' . - '
. It' ia asserted that the proposition to
reduce Is the result, of gentlemen's
sgreement between railroad officials.
Some days ago pasaenger representatives
of the Omaha-Kansas and Missouri roads
met in Chicago and there agreed to a
reduction between Omaha and points In
Kansas and Missouri. The reduction by
the Missouri Pacific is the. outcome of the
agreement. : ' , , '
' The. following comparison of rates as
between tha eld snd the new rates gives
an idea of what it means to the traveler.
There are scores of c'tles and towns af

with th president were agreed en a
courae In regard to what congress should
do In regard ,to 'armed ship" controversy

not feel thst a vote of confidence will ac
complish the object he seeks snd thst
foreign capitals enn he made to under
stand that the American government 1
united In the submarine negotiations only
by the out snd out defest of a resolu
tion proposing tn warn American off
armed ship.
The views of om of the leader de
veloped to he so much in conflict with
thote which the president outlined st
hla morning conference that, the leaders
urged the appointment of a joint com
mittee to go to President Wilson to aak
him for an official statement of what he
wants congress to do. The leaders con
sidered the aituatlon very much muddled.
