WELL KNOWN FINANCIER
TAKES HIS OWN LIFE
Mr. O. P. Heath, one oi' Charlotte's
oldest, best known and in
his day one of the South's most
prominent cotton merchants,
committed suicide Monday morning
at 11 o'clock in his office at
No 211-2 South College street by
shooting himself through the
head with a 32-caliber Colt bluesteel
revolver. Death was instantaneous.
Ill health with the
added tribulations brought on by
financial reverses, are assigned
I to account for the act. Twn
notes, sealed and addressed to
his wife, were found by those
who reached the scene first.
Their contents were not divulged
but it is stated that they related
to intimate personal matters
such as might be anticipated
under the circumstances. The
body will be carried to Monroe
on the 10:10 o'clock Seaboard
train this (Tuesday) morning
and the funeral will take place
at the Central Methodist church
immediately on arrival. Rev.
J. C. Rowe of Salisbury assisted
by Rev. M. T. Steele of Hickory :
Grove and Rev. J. E. Abernethy
of Monroe will have charge of
the services. ?Charlotte Observer,
Tuesday.

Heath came to Fort Mill over

many friends in this city. He
was widely known throughout
this section, especially among
the farmers, many of whom had
dealt with him during his long
career as a cotton dealer in

j Harris, of this city, and a great
uncle of the children of Mrs.
E. M. Belk. His wife was before

wife, five sons, Messrs. George,
Webb. Crawford. Harold and
Ernest Heath, and one daughter,
Miss Helen Heath. Mr. Heath
