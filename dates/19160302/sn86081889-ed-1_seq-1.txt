Interesting Extracts from Letters Re
cently Received from Former Ful
ton County People.
W. M. Cunningham, Jerome,
Nebr. Here is a money order
for another dollar. I could not
do without the Fulton County
News. It is just like getting a
letter from home. It is five
years since I left the Old Key
stone state, and I see by the
News that, in that time, a great
many Fulton County people have
gone to their final reward, and
some of them were near and dear
to me.
Isaac B. Wolfe, Bucyrus, 0.
You will find herewith a dollar
to renew my subscription, and I
thank you for not cutting my
name off your list when the time
ran out. It is a much appreciat
ed visitor in our home, and gives
us lots of news about our former
neighbors in good old Fulton
county.
H. Scott Unger, Altoona,
Here's two dollars. I want to
see how an "18" looks on the la
bel of my paper. We are always
glad to hear from the people in
"Little Fulton." Owing to the
fact that I have not been out of
the house this year yet, on" ac-'
count of a stubborn attack of
rheumatism, I have decided to
leave in a lew days for Hot
Springs, Ark., to take, at least,
a month's treatment at that
famous health resort.
Dorse Badly Injured.
On Monday, Wayne Cutchall,
tenant farmer on the Alex Pat
terson farm in the Cove, went
out to the woods with a team of
two horses for a load of wood.
He was riding the saddle horse,
and carried an ax on his should
er. In attempting to dismount
when he had reached a rank of
wood, the blade of the axe in
some way came down over the
horse's Hank, cutting a gash sev
en inches in. length clear in to the
intestines. The horse was a val
uable one, he having refused $225
for it just a short time ago.
Amos Seville was summoned
and sewed the wound, and it is
believed that the horse's life may
be saved.

Treat Seed Oats for Smnt.
The Department of Agriculture
is earnestly requesting farmers
to join hands with it in the abate
ment of the Oats smut nusiance.
We have been requested to pub
lish the following directions for a
simple way to avoid Oats Smut,
and Potato Scab. The formalin
is cheap costs but 30 or 40 cents
a pint, and can be had at all the
drug stores.
1. Spread the oats to be treat
ed on a floor, in a thin layer.
2. Mix a pint of formalin in
forty gallons of water in a barrel
tub or milk can.
3. Sprinkle the oats with this
dilute solution so as to thorough
ly moisten all the oats. In order
to accomplish this it is necessary
to rake or shovel the oats over
several times.
4. After the oats are well mois
tened place in a heap and cover
with canvas or sacks over night
or for six or eight hours.
5. The oats should be spread
out and allowed to dry thorough
ly in order to prevent the sprout
ing. Shovel about at least once
a day.
6. As a precaution. Oats that
have been treated usually swell
and thus will not run through
the drill as fast ' as other oats.
From a peck to a half bushel
more seed per acre is usually re
quired. 7. Treat all the bags as well as
the drill with the diluted forma
lin solution befor placing the
treated oats therein. Soak the
bags for at least twenty minutes.
8. Oats that have been treated
can be fed to animals if allowed
to dry out and be exposed to the
air for three or four hours after
treating with formalin.
One pint of 40 per cent forma
lin should be mixed with forty
gallons of water and that mix
ture will treat sixty bushels of
oats.
Farmers who are expecting to
treat seed potatoes for the scab
should mix a pint of formalin to
thirty gallons of water. Place
the potatoes in sacks and soak in
the solution for two hoursfefore
cutting and place out to dry.
Hospital Report
We have just received from D.
B. Nace, Treasurer and Business
Manager of the Chambersburg
Hospital the annual report of
that institution which will be
read with interest by Fulton
County people, roany of whom
have been recipients of its ad van
tages during the past year.
The report shows that since
the opening in 1904 there have
been admitted 3,547 patients. In
that time the hospital has cost
$156,098.94 and it has a balance
of $5,428.27. In the past two
years the cost of operating the
institution was $26,863.55, and
the receipts were $28,239.09, di
vided as follows: State appropri
ations, 13,364.14; from pay and
part pay patients, $14,733.14; bal
ance May 31, 1913, $141.51.
In the year covered by the re
port there were 550 patients
treated, of which 500 were dis
charged as cured, improved or
unimproved; 29 died and 21 re
mained when the report closed.
The death rate for the year,
after deducting cases dying with
in 48 hours of admission, was 3.4
per cent.
The appendicitis cases lead in
number. There were 42 opera
tions for acute appendicitis in
the year; all were successful and
the 42 cases were discharged cur
ed. There were 60 operations
for removal of to lis and ade
noids and all wevo successful.
Intestinal obstruction caused
the most deaths five, while frac
tures of the skull and of the 'fe
mur each caused three deaths.
Five cases of fractured skull
were treated, two were cured
and three died.
Two cases of hair lip were cur
ed. During the yea? five members
of the medical staff were taken
by death.
The report tells of many im
provements made to the equip
ment and buildings during the
year.
FEBRUARY DONOR ROLL.
Names of New Subscribers and Others
Who Paid Subscription During the
Second Month of the Year.
Here we are again. Another
month has rolled around. And
this reminds the Editor that more
than fifty years has rolled around
since he went into the office of
the Fulton Democrat to learn to
kindle the fire with printer's ink
(when the boss wasn't about),
sweep out the office, set type,
manipulate the hand roller on
press days, "carry" .the papers
(at that time, the papers were
carried around and delivered at
the homes of the town subscri
bers as soon as they were print
edit wasn't much of a job),
and play the "devil" generally.
The Democrat office at that
time was in a little old-fashioned
one story building that occupied
the site where the Thomas F.
Sloan property stands. John R.
Donehoo, a bright young lawyer
(but unfortunately too fond of
booze) was the editor. The bat
ance of the office force was John
Dunlap, Will Goldsmith, and Sam
Divelv all of whom have long
since passed up their last galley
of proof.
The Fulton County News is
now in its seventeenth year and
has a clean bill of health. When
it is considered that the circuta
tion of country newspapers aver
ages less than 1000, it is a mat
ter of gratification to the friends
who have helped to make the
News what it is, to know that
the News has a bona fide list of
moreN than 2300. The prompt
ness with which its subscribers
"come across" with the long
green every month is an evi
dence of appreciation and a de
sire to help a good thing along.
If any of our subscribers find
they have a "14" on their label,
the month of March is an elegant
time to have it erased and a 17
put in its place. To the prompt
payers and new subscribers on
the roll this week, we say THANK
YOU: May you live long and
prosper.

New Hotel in McConnellsburg.
As has been told in the News,
ex-Sheriff James J. Harris had
bought the stone house, for a
long time known as the Tommy
Patterson property, in McCon
nellsburg, Last summer he ad
ded large porches to the building
and since taking possession the
first of January, he has been bu
sy fitting up the property for ho
tel purposes. He has just com
pleted a large hotel stable where
he can take the best care of hors
es. At an expense of two hun
dred and fifty dollars, he has in
stalled an acetylene light plant,
the bedrooms have been newly
furnished, and everything is now
ready for the accommodation of
the traveling public, and he asks
for a share of public patronage.
In connection with the hotel,
he is conducting a restaurant,
which will be open to the public
from early morning until a rea
sonable closing time at night, at
which place you can get anything
from a sandwich for hve cents,
to a full meal at a reaspnable
price. His regular hotel rates
are as low as he can consistently
make them, 30 cents a meal, or
$1.20 cents a day for meals and
lodging.
The Sideling Dill Railroad.
It is currently reported that
the Reichtley Bros., railroad
which extends from Sixmile Run
eastward through Wells Tannery
and out upon the Sideling1 Hill
mountain, will soon be extended
to Brush Creek Valley.
This would have been done last
summer, but the State Highway
Department would not allow them
to cross the Lincoln Highway at
grade. It is said that an agree
ment has been reached, and that
the citizens of Brush Creek Val
ley will soon have the advantage
of freight transportation at least
The Reichtley Bros, are lum
bermen and the road is being
built primarily to get their lum
ber to market

STUDY YOLK INDIVIDUALS.
Little Talks on Health and Djgiene by
Samuel G. Dixon, M. D., LL. D.,
Commissioner of Health.
Engineers will tell you that no
two locomotives are ever exactly
alike. They may be turned out
to an exactness that defies the
most modern instruments for
measurement or weight to show
any differences. Put into service,
each machine will develop indi
vidual characteristics, one cften
being superior for its purpose.
This same unknown quantity is
experienced in sea-going vessels.
The trial trip i3 the only test of
their efficiency.
The medical man never finds
two human beings with the same
dispositions, mental or physical
strength, yet we are created aft
er the same model, but owing to
dissimilar nerve forces or the life
of our tissues, each individual has
certain differences and some have
real idiosyncrasies.
There are broad rules of nature
relating to our physical welfare
which we cannot transgress with
out evil results. Likewise there
are certain things which the ma
jority of us can do without put
ting any unusual strain on our
physique, but here begins the
question of the adjustment of the
individual piece of machinery.
We must study our physical limi
tations and find out just what
scope we have. Because one man
can live or almost exist on an
exclusive meat diet it is no rea
son why the next fellow can.
Men and women often ruin their
health by trying to do the things
simply because others do them.
Each should get his own measure.
The question of age must enter
into consideration. It is well to
bear in mind that exertion which
does not seem a strain at one
period in life may be dangerous
in later years.
These same principles apply in
matters of diet. There are food
stuffs wholesome enough to the
average individual, which seems
to have a deleterious effect on the
few.
We nrust measure our individu
al characteristics and avoid those
things that do not agree with us.
All of these things should be
observed and taken into consid
eration. They are the results of
weaknesses or peculiarities in
our living machinery and to reach
and maintain efficiency, they
must be recognized and respect
ed. Farm Notes.
Do not forget that the coddling
moth lays its eggs in the blossom-not
in the apple. Get ready
to spray when apple blossoms be
gin to fall from the trees, and
avoid wormy apples.
On March 10th, at 10 a. m., a
grange meeting will be held in
Bedford, and in the afternoon,
E. K. Hibshman, State Leader
of the . County Farm Advisers,
wsll explain the advantages of
establislfing a Farm Bureau in.
the county, and how it may be
done. Twenty-two Pennsylvania
counties now have Farm Advis
ers, and fourteen more have
made application for them.
If thirty cents worth of forma
lin will save a crop of oats from
smut it's worth trying. See di
rections elsewhere in this paper.
Last spring the News had many
calls for directions in the use of
formalin to kill potato scab.
Going to plant something this
spring to plough down later to
make humus?
We believe there is room for
many bright boys and girls to
raise pheasants in Fulton county.
If fifty pheasants could be raised
to maturity each year; they could
be sold for at least $250, But
the "peeps" must be supplied
liberally with ant's eggs and lit
tle grub worms as an almost ex
clusive diet for the first fev
weeks, when raised in captivity.
