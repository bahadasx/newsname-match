SECOND BEST GARAGE
IN NORTHERN ARIZONA
Is to Be Built by Babbitt-Poison
Co. on Location of Present
Gargage.
Babbitt-Poison Co. is planning
the erection of a modern and up-to-date
garage that will be the' second
best in Northern Arizona. It will
be located on the lots occupied by
their old garage and will reach from
street to street, having two fronia,
one on Railroad Avenue and the
other on Bill Williams Avenue.
The walls will be of stone, the
present sfanding walls being used
and added onto. The floor will be
of cement, and the roof will be of a
composition yet to be settled upon.
The entire structure will be as
nearly fire-proof as it can be made.
The building will contain a com
plete machine shop, and display
and storage rooms. A complete
line of repairs forBuick and Chevro
let cars will be kept in stock. In
every way, it will be a permanent
structure and it will be a great ad
vertisement for the town.
A manager for the garage ha9
not yet been secured. The Com
pany will insist upon a man with
expert training and experience.
Work on the building will start
in about thirty days, weather per
mitting. The only larger gaiage in North
ern Arizona is the Babbitt Bros.
Garage at Flagstaff, and that is
the finest in the Southwest, Los
Angeles included. .

RAILROADS WON'T
HANDLE BOOZE
At a meeting of the attorneys
repiesenting the various railroads
of Arizona, it was decided that the
railroads would not accept ship
ments of liquor, whether for per
sonal use or not, so long as they
are not forced to do so by the
courts. In the first place the rail
roads do not want the liquor busi
ness, and in the second they fear
that as the law stands, they might
be held liable for shipments which
were represented to be for private
but later proved to be for other
purposes.

FOLL REPORT NEXT WEEK
The School Board has supplied

meeting held lait week, Thursday.
The report will be published in full

MRS. HENRIETTA F. BOGGELN
After a long and lingering illness
the spirit of Mrs. Henrietta Fred
ri ka Buggeln departed this life at
one minute to four, February 19,
1916. She was ' surrounded by her
children at the last hour and leaves
behind many sorrowing acquain
tances and friends.
Mrs. Buggeln was "born in West
fall, Germany, March 21, 1838. At
the age of fourteen Mrs. Buggeln
was confirmed in the Lutheran
Church and continued a consistent
member of that church to the time
of her death. In 1855 she moved
to the United States and settled in
Missouri. There she made her home
until 1900, when she moved with
her daughter, Mrs. Hoffmeyer, to
Williams, Arizona. Since that time
she has made her home with her
children here in this city.
Mrs. Buggeln, in April 11, 1861,
married Mr. Martin Buggelii Sr. To
tMs union were born eight children,
four of whom had passed on before
her, four remaining behind, one
living at Prescott, one at Grand
Canyon and two in Williams.
It was my good fortune some days
be fore Mrs. Buggeln passed away
to talk with her. Upon questioning
her as to how everything stood be
tween her and her Maker, she an
swered, "Oh, everything is all right,
I have just been waiting for the
blessed Jesus to come and take me.
I am so tired, so weary of this bat
tle of life. Oftentimes when there
comes over me this feeling of weari
ness, there seems nothing left fo
me but to call on Jesus."
Those who were watching at her
side in the last moments tell me
that her last words were, "Oh
Blessed Jesus, do come and take
me." t . ." - . . , .
She began failing rapidly in
strength toward the latter part of
the week and at one minute to four
she breathed her last.
The scenes of lime were singing,
The dawn of Heaven breaks,
The summer morn she sighed for,
The fair sweet morn "awakes.
Dark, dark with but the midnight
fiut day spring is at hand
And glory, glory dwelleth on her
In Emmanuel s laid.
The King is there in beauty
Without a fear she sees
It were a well spent journey
Though seven deaths lay between.
The Lamb with His fair army
Doth on Mt. Zion stand
And glory, glory dwelleth
In her Emmanuel's land.

OATMAN CAPITALIST
From Phoenix Republican
Feb. 27. J. T. Burns, secretary
and manager of the Oatman -Amalgamated,
is in the city for a couple
of days, looking after the affairs of
the companies in which he is in
terested. Speaking of Mr. Burns under the
heading, "A Live Wire Who Really
Performs," the Mineral Wealth
says:
"J. T. Burns a few weeks ago
came into Oatman, looked over the
situation, got busy and, getting a
number of claim owners together,
brought cohesion out of chaos, with
the result that one of the biggest
and most enterprising companies in
the big camp was created. Twenty
two thousand dollars in real money
was subscribed by Arizona and
Colorado capitalists before incor
poration articles were drawn. Fifty
thousand dollars is now being
raised in addition to the first sum,
all of which will be expended in
the development of the properties.
"The ground controlled by the
Oatman Amalgamated embraces
seven strong veins, and it is the be
lief of engineers that here is the
Gold Road and Crown City veins,
and once this fact is established the
mine will take its place among the
big ones.
"Mr. Burns advises that Ettiene
A. Ritter, formerly of the Geologi
cal Survey of France, is to arrive
today, for the purpose of making
an extensive examination of the
Oatman Amalgamated properties
and other properties, in which Mr.
Burns is interested in the San Fran
cisco district, t Mr.- Ritter- repie-
sents large New York interests, and
a favorable report from him fore
shadows investment by eastern cap
ital."
Since the above appeared in the
Mineral Wealth, Mr. Ritter has vis
ited the property of the Oatman
Amalgamated ana his report will
be issued in a few days.
