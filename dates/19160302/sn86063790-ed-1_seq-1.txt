ELECTED COKER'S PRESIDENT.
Dean of Wake Forest College to Succeed
Late Dr. Jones at Hartsville.
Hartsville, Feb. 23.?At a meeting
of the board of trustees of Coker eellege
today, in Hartsville, Dr. E. W.
Sikes, of Wake Forest, N. C., was
unanimously elected president of the
institution. Since the death of President
Howard Lee Jones, last September,
the trustees and friends of the
college have been carefully considering
the problem of securing a worthy
successor to fill, this important place.
While many names of competent and
distinguished men have been suggested
no one has been offered the position
until the election of Dr. Sikes.
Some of tljs friends of Dr. Sikes knew
that he had recently visited Hartsville
by invitation and had spoken at
the First Baptist church and in the
college auditorium, and had made a
most pleasant impression on the people.
It was suspected that his was
one of the names under consideration
and rumor had it that Dr. Sikes had
been elected and had accepted the
presidency before the trustees met
and took definite action in the matter.
Dr. Sikes graduated from Wake
Forest college in 1891, with the M.
A. degree. He afterward continued
his studies in Johns Hopkins university,
and in 1897 got his Ph. D. degree
from that institution. In 1898
he accepted a position in his alma
mater as professor of political economy
and has held that chair now for
eighteen years.

: FOUND DEAD BESIDE TRACK. !
i
i Lumber
Mill Operator Evidently Kill- \
ed by Train.
Florence, Feb. 25.?Coroner J. L.
Gunn was called to .Mars Bluff early
, last evening to hold an inquest over
the body of a man, who had been
found dead beside the tracks of the
Atlantic Coast Line at a point near
what is known as the Williams & Mci
Keithan Lumber company, or Pate's
i
Mill.
The lifeless body proved to be that
of C. H. Cummings, a well-to-dolumber
mill operator of Elizabeth;
town, N. C. From what could be
: gathered from the testimony, it
I seems that Mr. Cummings had come
down to Mars Bluff to purchase a
j saw mill on the plantation of Dr. T.
C. Johnson, and after attending to
his business was walking along the
double track of the Coast Line and
must have been struck by a passing
freight train. His body was yet
warm when found, but life was extinct.
The body was taken in charge
by the coroner and the family of
Cummings notified.
HUNDRED THOUSAND DAMAGES.
Trial at Hampton of Suit Against Seaboard
Ends in Verdict for Defense.
Columbia, Feb. 27.?A verdict in
favor of the defendant has been returned
in the case of B. J. and W. E."
Peeples, administrators of J. W. Peeples,
deceased, against the Seaboard
Air Line railway, in which damages
for $100,000 for the death of J. W.
Peeples were sought. The case was
on trial for five days at Hampton before
Judge Prince.
The Savannah Morning News of
yesterday said:
"J. W. Peeples was killed by a
Lwork train of the Seab^a,rd Air Line
on a crossing at Estill, S. C., on April
4, 1914. He was survived by several
children and a number of other heirs.
He was a large planter and was also
engaged in the banking business. |
Soon after Mr. Peeples's death his |
two sons, B. J. and W. E. Peeples,
brought suit against the Seaboard for
$ 100,000 for the death of their
father.
"Their allegation was that the employees
of the defendant were negligent
in that no bells or whistles were
sounded on the work' train for the
crossing and that a proper lookout
was not kept. The railroad's contention
was that Mr. /Peeples was responsible
for his pw.n, death by stepping
backward in front-^of the .moving
train, denying all the allegations of j
the plaintiffs, while the-killing was
admitted.
"The case has attracted much attention.
, The plaintiffs were represented
by the law firm of Warren &
Warren of Hampton, while the defense
was represented by the firm of
Lylcs & Lyles, of Columbia and J. W.
Manuel, of Hampton. The case was
investigated and prepared by Claim
Agents W. C. Johnston and A. C.
Winter for the Seaboard."
SENTENCED TO BE HANGED.
Georgian is Convicted of Murdering
His Wife.
Macon, Ga., Feb. 24.?Bun 0. Lucas
was convicted by a jury in superior
court here late today of the murder
of his wife, Ida Mae Lucas, September
18, 1915. The jury was out
four hours. It was the second trial
of the case, the first resulting in a
mistrial. The State showed that Mrs.
Lucas had applied for a divorce one
month before she was shot and killed
and a witness testified: "Lucas said
she would not live to get the divorce."
This testimony was not brought out
at the first trial. Lucas declared
that he shot his wife while aiming at
a man he found in her company. The
Lucas children and other witnesses
testified that there was no other man
in the case. Lucas was sentenced to
be hanged on April 14.

GRAVE CRISIS AGAIN FACED
I
AMERICA AWAITS RESULTS WITH
GRAVE CONCERN.
r
German Submarine Decree Causes j
Much Concern in Washing- c
ton.?No Action Yet. f
c
Washington, Feb. 29.?'Results of j .
the new Austro-German submarined
campaign against armed merchant L
r
ships of the entente allies, beginning c
at midnight, are awaited by the United
States with grave concern.
Although under their new instructions
Teutonic naval commanders are ^
authorized to sink without warning ^
all armed enemy merchantmen they ^
eicounter, it is understood they have ^
been told to make sure if possible c
that American citizens are not aboard! J
any ship attacked. Furthermore, in
g
the latest communication regarding
submarine warfare Germany has assured
the United States that the new
orders are so formulated as to pre-,
vent the destruction of enemy liners
"on account of their armament unless
such armament is proved."
The attitude of the United States 'i
government towards the new policy c
of Germany and Austria has not been ]
definitely determined. President j
Wilson today discussed the subject in c
a conference with Secretary Lansing 2
and then laid the German communi- c
cation before his cabinet. Later it i t
was said that because the all impor- j
tant appendicies to the German men- \
orandum had been delayed in transit j
the State department thus far was un- f
able to determine whether the claims t
i 1
set forward by Germany and Austria; x
is justification of their course were 2
sustained. An effort probably will be j
made to trace the delayed appendices, t
Moreover it has not yet been de- \
cided whether Germany's reiterated j
assurances regarding the future con- f
duct of submarine warfare are of a
character broad enough to warrant (
acceptance of the German proposal \
toxsettle the issues growing out of the j
sinking of the Lusitania. A decision ]
on that controversy may be reached
in a few days. Meanwhile, if any: ]
American citizen is injured in an attack
by a submarine on a merchant
ship which does not resist and has no ]
intention of using its armament
otherwise than defensively, a grave
situation will arise. *
' The United States stands at this 1
time, as it has always done, for/ the
right of American citizens to travel
with safety on defensively armed
ships. If the German contentions.1
are sustained, however, and it is 1
<i
proved conclusively that a ship upon:
nrViinh on AmdriMn ma/v hp> iniured *
used defensive armament for pur-j ]
poses of offense, it is considered unlikely
that this government will take j
any action. It never has contended
that ships committing attacks or
other offensive acts or under orders j..
so to conduct themselves are im-:
mune from summary destruction.
BILL OF MUCH IMPORTANCE.
Is Water Power Measure Now Before
Senate.
Washington, Feb. 24.?The water (
power bill now before the senate is a I
measure which may become of vital
importance to the whole country at j
large. Senator Smith, of South Caro-* r
lina, has been working with experts, i
of th9 department of agriculture up- <
on amendments to the measure which 1
will enable the government to take
over the control and use of the water j 1
powers of the nation for the benefit' 1
of the people. In his amendments; 1
Senator Smith contemplates the use t
of the water powers by the govern- <
ment for the production of munitions s
of war in time of war and in time 1
of peace their use, under proper gov- s
ernmental control, in the manufac- i
ture of fertilizers. The proposed plan s
is wide in its scope and vastly im- 1
portant, and because of these facts s
the senator is proceeding slowly in *
his suggestions. He had numerous r
conferences with the officials of the c
department, and in conjunction with
them legislation looking to the above s
ends is being framed. \
Byrnes Can Trust AVilson.
I
Washington, Feb. 26.?Congress- j
man Byrnes today expressed himself
as follows on the subject of the agita- ^
tion over armed ships: "I do not
believe that at this stage of the game I
congress should interfere with the
president in his negotiations on the j.
armed merchantman question, and I
do not think there is any chance of
such interference. Regardless of
* - /? ii
their views as to the merus or uie
question and of the Lansing letter to
Great Britain, members of the house 1
believe it would be unwise to adopt f
any of the resolutions proposed." \

German Officers Anxious for Breach.

Amsterdam, Holland, Feb. 26.? - j:
The Frankfurter Zeitung publishes
in interview on submarine warfare
credited to a high naval official whose
news, in substance, follow:
"A majority of German naval oficers

such a position that she need have

she could declare all Great Britain
ilockaded and announce that every
(hip of whatever flag which attemptid
to enter a British port would be
egarded as a blockade runner and
lestroy it without warning.
"This policy would lead to the
starvation of Britain and thus to
ler submission and then automaticall
y the submission of Russia and
France. America then would be isoated
and would have to submit be:ause
Germany having obtained all

would be far stronger on the

"America, when defeated, would
