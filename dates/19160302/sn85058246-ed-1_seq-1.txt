HOWELL AND '
BULLEN RETURN
FROM COAST
B Successful In Negotiating Land Sales
B and Enjoy Change of Climate
H Afforded
H Messrs. William M. Howell and
jH. Horschol Bullon returned Monday
R evening from a Uo weeks business
B trip on the Pacific coast. Thoy went.
B to San Francisco, Santa Cruz, Men-
BS- terey, Del Monte, Los Angeles and a
BS number of Its suburban cities and
Bj towns, and report the weather do-
BK llghtful. To chnngo from perpetual
BS summer to another winter In the
Bx short spaco of a few hours is some-
Bf thing hard to realize but tlio expert-
BX ence of these gentlemen demonstrate
Bt conclusively that such conditions
Bf prevail in this great west of ours.
Be At San Francisco they were In-
Bj formed that during January more
BE Tain had tallort than since the yea.'
Bj 1SC0, a state of affairs that makes
BJ the grain raiser very happy, but tho
BJ extremely delightful days following
BJ during February were somewhat
BJ alarming to the fruit raiser, ho feur-
BJ cd tho frosts before the buds v. era
BJ sufficiently matured to escape unln-
BJ jurcd. All down the coast the samo
BJ rainy conditions, had prevailed, and
BJ great crowds of men wero at work
BJ repairing railroads, highways, wash-
BJ cs in fields etc.
BJ Business conditions slnco the clos-
BJ ing of the fair at San Francisco bas
BJ been slack, and in tho south a gen-
BJ cral depression has been on for somo
BJ time. The land men, bankers, and
BJ merchants are hopeful, and are look-
BJ Ing for a lively period of relaxation
BJ and Investment. The banks are full
BJ of money and there' are many itching
JH hnnds to get hold of it. While awuy
Plw 'those gentlemen talked Promontory-
JJP Curlew lands, and to the average
Bf Callforntan who flnda he has to pay
Bj from $500 to $8000 per aero for land
BJ an offer to purchaso good wheat
BJ lands at $10 per aero is somewhat of
BJ an oyo opener. In fact tho dlfferenco
BJ is so great that tho Callfornlan can
BJ hardly bollovo tho land is any good
Bj at such a ( price, but after an lnvcs-
H tigatlon conditions warrant tho valid-
Bj lty of such prices, and" many good
H prospects aro 'thus secured, Thoy
B wcro successful in negotiating sales
H for a largo acreage of their lands and
B before the season passes expect to
H transfer many thousands of acres.
H At Monterey they visited with Mr,
B and Mrs. David Stoddard, Dave was
dressed in high top boots,' corduroy
H trousers, and a soft Blilrt and was In
tho lumber business' 'right. AHe be
B llevea tho only way,to learn the
business is to get into regulation
costumo and learn It frorajtho,, stump
B up. His wife Mary HOjft)llf was
tho samo charming girl of her school
days, and was perfectly delighted
with her now homo. '
At Monterey thoy were entertain
H )d by. Lieut, Reese Howell. Tluy
H dined at tho officer's bachelor quar
m (era, attended a polo gamo Sunday
H afternoon at Del Monto, motored
nround tho bay for a dlstanco of
Iwonty miles, and thence on to Loi
Angeles. Iteeso Howell Is a very
popular officer; and likes his assign
ment flno.
At Long Tlonch thoy lslted Mr.
and Mrs. Earl Itobinson and Mrs.
Joscphino Hul!en. Earl has a good
position in ono of tho big schools
there, is doing well and giving first
class satisfaction. Tho women folKs
nro thoroughly enjoying tho oceau
bredzo and aummor weother.
When asked about politics they
roplled that thoy wore ory busy
and had but" very llttlo timo to do
to to politics. Thoy, however, Jld
my that tho entire state was in a
condition of unrest Incident to tho
f appointment of delegates to tho com
ing national Republican convention.
That throughout tho Republican and
Progressive ranks the ono desiro to
beaj tho prcsont democratic admin
istration Boomed paramount, but tho
proceedings enacted so far In tho
matter of selection of delegates ro
sombled tho opening of n prize fight,
when tho prlnclplos meet in tho

boforo tho slugging begins.
The Republicans havo refused to
