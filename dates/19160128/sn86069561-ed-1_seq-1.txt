should feel proud of its present
school system. A few years ago
found us lacking the advantages
that we were justly entitled to in
educational development and
while we coud all see that many
of our boys and girls, especially
those in the country round us,
were forced to seek elsewhere for
school advantages that now can be
had in our own Graded and High
School. We were handicapped to
the extent that we ourselvas must
first be educated to the great
needs of those about us. Now we
have a system that is second to
none in the county and a corps of
teachers that are well qualified to
handle the affairs of one of Rock
castle's best and most up-to-date
Graded and High-Schools. The

DIXIE HIGHWAY
The Times-Star, of Cincinnati,
has the following editorial on the
"Progress of the Dixie High
way," which will be of interest
uere: "It was less than a year
ago that the Middle West determ
ined on an active effort to make
Dixie Highway a reality. Yet
the progress actually made in con
struction and preparation since
that time is amazing. It is now
sxpectel that the great highway,
.vbich is to reach from Miama ,
J'la., to Chicago and Michigan,
hrough Cincinnati and Louisville
fill be completed from end to
end much sooner than originally
expected. One third of the coun
ies through which the highway
will pass,- reported expenditures
n six months of $1,765,000 on
ictual construction. Using these
igures as a basis, the American
ontrctor estimates that the
amount spent in 1915 in all of the
1 62 counties on the routes flfollow
ed by the highway was not less
than $5,390,000. This is a very
Impressive beginning. The. same
authority says that in one third
of the total number of counties
interested, $6,931,000 is known to
be available for work in i9i6.
Using the same basis of estimates
the American Contractor figures
that in 162 counties $20,900,000
will be available for 1916. At
this rate the Dixie Highway will
soon be a reality. It will form a
magnificent North and South route
and one which should spur its
proposed east to west rival to
greater activity."
An Indiana man married his

PROHIBITION
Drys Lose In The Senate
By a Vote of 20
to 14
ANTI-PASS GOES THRU
Much Interest Over Woman Suffrage
Stanley County Will Likely Be
Made A Business Session.
FROST BILL DEFEATED.
The Statewide prohibition
amendment measure, known as
the Frost-Hamilton bill, was de
feated in the Senate Tuesday by
a vote of 20 to 14. Party lines
were laid aside.
The "Drys" are preparing to
push other measure in effort to
rid state of the liquor traffic.
Frankfort, Ky. (Special). State
wide prohibition, woman suffrage and
an anti-pass bill are the paramount is
sues to be settled at this session of the
Kentucky General Assembly.
There has hardly been a day since
the 1916 session opened but that these
three matters have been mentioned or
referred to in resolutions, bills and the
like.
The "wets" claim that a show-down
on the liquor question was forced too
early for the good of a business ad
ministration, but the "drys" claim they
wanted to know where every member
stands at the earliest possible date.
Elated over their victory In having
the State-wide bill favorably reported
by the Senate committee, the "drys"
gave the administration the biggest
surprise of their lives and staged a
battle of more than ordinary interest,
although it may be short and decisive.
Dr. Norman A. Palmer, Superintend
ent of tha Kentucky Anti-Saloon
League, and Mrs. Frances E. Beau
champ, President of the Kentucky
W o m a n's Christian Temperance
Union, have been on the ground since
the opening of the Legislature. It is
said that the usual paid lobbyists of
the distillers have not made their ap
pearance yet. In the last Legisla
ture of" 1912 the State-wide question
was deferred until the closing days of
the General Assembly.
Drastic enough to remedy the evils
so long complained of by the people,
the administration's anti-lobby, anti
trust and corrupt practice measures
have been introduced in both Houses
and will be pushed by Governor Stan
ley, who pledged himself to see that
they were enacted.
The bill to reimburse Kentuckians
for cattle destroyed in stamping out
the epidemic of foot and mouth dis
ease is expected to pass both Houses
with little opposition. It provides
$68,000 to cover these losses sustained
by farmers. Similar bills have been
passed by fourteen Stated.
Representative Frank C. Greene, of
Carrollton, has said that he will op
pose Hon. Arthur Rouse, Burlington,
for the renomlnation to Congress from
the Sixth District. Greene is also de
termined to push his "Jim Crow" bill,
providing for the separation of street
cars with compartments for negroes.
Judge James M. Benton has made
It known that he does not intend o
oppose Representative J. Campbell
Cantrill, of the Seventh District, in
event he is not selected to succeed the
late Justice Lamar on the Supreme
bench by President Wilson. He was
supported for the latter place by all
except three of the Kentucky delega
tion in Congress.
!
The fight of the dry forces In the
Legislature to secure the passage of
a State-wide amendment for prohibi
tion is on'" the initial struggle that
will be waged during this session.
A bill is to be introduced to prohibit
the manufacture of intoxicating
liquors in Kentucky;
The constitution Is silent on the
question of the manufacture of intoxi
cating liquors. The sale, barter or
loan is permitted by Section 61 of the
constitution, but the word "manufac
ture" was left out, so that the dry
forces claim that a bill to prohibit the
manufacture may be passed by a ma
jority vote. It is in the hands of Sen
ator Frost and Representative Hamil
ton, who introduced the State-wide
bills in the Senate and House respec
tively. Judge Joe E. Williams, of McCreary
County, is In Frankfort claiming that
the impeachment charges are "utter
ly groundless" and says that he is
there to answer them in person.
Congressman A. W. Barkley has In
troduced a bill in Congress "to pre
vent the manufacture and sale of al
coholic liquors in the District of Co
lumbia," and says that it fs his inten
tion to push the bill to turn the na
tional capital dry. He said that it was
a mistake to accuse Kentucky as be
ing a "whiskey State," for 114 out of
120 counties are dry.
It is regarded as somewhat novel
that a member of Congress from the
State that produces more whiskey
than any other in the Union, and has
three-fifths of all the whiskey in the
United States in. its bonded ware
houses, should champion the cause of
prohibition, according to Washington
dispatches.
Claiming to have saved the sum of
$200,000 for the people ot tha State
in fire insurance, the State Iniuraccb
Board nasaued a statement showing
that during the past fonr years the
reduction in Kentucky Is 5 cenU more
on the hundred dollars of insurance
than the average for the whole coun
try. The total amount of Insurance
covered by the policies In Kentucky Is
about $400,000,000 annually.
A property classification bill to con
form with the Ideas of the best posted
persons In a number of States will
shortly be introduced, according to
Chairman W. A. Perry, of the House
Revenue and Taxation Committee.
The measure providing for the
working of convicts on the State
roads, which was adopted as a consti
tutional amendment at the November
election, is receiving favorable com
ment, and provisions will be made for
the carrying out of it,
Indorsed by Governor Stanley and
Attorney General Logan, the anti-pass
bill introduced by Representative
Stricklett, of Covington, passed the
Senate by a vote of 27 to 7 after be
ing amended to permit tne exchange of
railroad passes for advertising space
in the newspapers. If the bill passes
the House it becomes effective January
1. 1917.
A fine of not less than $500 nor
more than $2,500 and a Jail sentence of
not less than ten days nor more than
thirty days for any railroad company
furnishing passes. A forfeiture of of
fice and a fine of from $100 to $500
for any state official accepting free
transportation.
The bill is one of the strong Demo
cratic party pledges and was the first
to be read into the Senate calendar.
To make the provision for the ex
change of passes from the railroads
with the newspapers for advertising.
James B. Steara, of Nicholasville.
President of the Kentucky Press As
sociation, and G. B. Senff, of Mt. Ster
ling, Chairman of the Legislative Com
mittee of the association, called on
Governor Stanley to urge him not to
oppose this amendment
The General Assembly has extended
an invitation to President Woodrow
Wilson to address a Joint session at
his convenience. He has also been
invited to attend a meeting that will
be given by the Kentucky Illiteracy
Commission. He has accepted the In
vitation if It is possible for him to
do so.
Mrs. Cora Wilson Stewart, President
of the Illiteracy Commission, will
probably address a Joint session of
the General Assembly Thursday, Feb
ruary 17, as a joint resolution was
offered in the Senate by President Pro
Tem. Combs Inviting her.
At the request of Covington minis
ters, bill was Introduced by Repre
sentative Green, of Carroll County,
prohibiting the use of screens and
blinds which now protect the interior
of saloons from public view. It Is
claimed that the bill will enable the
"drys" to better handle the liquor
problem In that locality.
In an effort to carry out the Re
publican campaign pledges. Represen
tative Stone, of Crittenden County, In
troduced a bill which will be pushed
for the abolishment of the State Firs
Marshal Department,
Announcing his candidacy for Con
gress in the Eighth District, Repre
sentative George L. Pickett, of Shpl
byville, a cousin of Governor Stanley,
says that h t Is going to give Congress
man Harvey Helm the battle of his
life.
. A house-to-house canvass will be
iade all over the state by the Wo
iuans Christian Temperance Union
securing s'gners to petitions request
ing the Legislature to pass the amend
ment providing for a statewide vote
on prohibition. It is their plan to
send a petition of at least 1,000 names
to the General Assembly each day.
Mrs. Beatrice Hale, of New York,
one of the leading suffragists of the
country, received a warm welcome on
her visit to the State Capital and In
her address to the Joint session of the
General Assembly. She was introduc
ed by Lieutenant Governor James D.
Black.
Suffrage leaders claim an abundance
of confidence in passing their bill pro
viding for a statewide, vote next year.
Statewide prohibition was given a
start in the Senate when tha Senate
Committee on Constitutional Amend
ments decided to report favorably Sen
ator Frost's bill providing for th
amendment to be submitted to the
people of Kentucky at the 1917 elec
tion. The vote on the committee, which
was taken In executive session, was:
For, Williams, Montgomery, FrosJ.
An tie; against. Knight, Littrell and
Stricklett, Senator Zimmerman re
frained from voting.
One hundred citizens from Pike
County arrived in. Frankfort to use
their concerted action against the pro
posed bill to divide the county and
make Stanley County out ot the par
tition. They appeared before the Gen
eral Assembly in a body.
It is claimed that it will be a con
stitutional impossibility to divide the
county since Pike County at present
contains only 785.55 square miles.
This question, however, is in dispute,
and it will have to be determined by
the Virginia line. The constitution
provides tr u a county must coataia
at lest 400 square miles; .-
