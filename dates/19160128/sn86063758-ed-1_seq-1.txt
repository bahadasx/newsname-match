by Senator Brice of Chester county,

it was urged that it would take sevi
. eral million* of dollars from the tax
books of the state ana practically nul|flh_
Jify the work done by the attorney
Bw* general's office in the matter of taxation
of banks. Some of the opponents

state tax commission. Senator Johnl
srone of Newberry noted for the pas
I cage of the bill.
For State Highway Commission.
Tne advisability of creating a state

Special to The Herald and News.
Pomaria, Jan. 27.?-After a few days
of rain, we are again enjoying the
bright sunshine.
The last few days have put the roads
in bad condition. The road leading out
from Pomaria through the Buncombe
section is almost impassible for bug
gies and wagons, and no one can guess
when an auto will be able to pass
over that section of road from Mr.
Caldell Ruff's to Mr. Drayton Wicker's.
This- is partly due to the fact that Mr.
Rates Boland has been, and is still,
hauling lumber from his saw mill to
Pomaria with two wagons each day.
There is also a very bad place in the
swamp at Mud creek just beyond Bethlehem
church. Some amendments have
been made there by draining the
swamp. A great deal more could be
done with just a little labor.
Mr. Arthur Counts' has been nursing
a bad face for the past few days,
caused from a boil on his right cheek,
but is still able to hold down Xo. 3. It
requires quite a nerve for a man to
nurse a boil and make his rounds of
26 miles and deliver heavy mail and
answer his ladies' correspondents and
p-ease his- customers over three bad
roads though "Box" has it.

* THE IDLER. <S>
<$> <$>
/Tiho CJtafo nars?rarvhAr "has tho fnl
lowing observation in a recent issue:
" We are in a perpetual tremor lest the
legislature pass a law requiring all
paragraphers to submit to the Binet
Simon mentality test." Now, I don't
think I know what that is, but I want
to say to this young man that he might
well be in a tremor, because if Mr.
Wolfe or some of those other legislators,
Mr. McMahan for instance,
should happen to see this paragraph
they are just as like as not to intro- j
duce a bill and the legislature would j
~ure pass it. But I believe they are
going to spare unto you that gallon-amonth,
and there is some consolation
in that. Did you read that argument
of the attorney general on the gallona-month
law? Read it, and just see
what sensible laws some of the prohibition
states have passed. Why, I no
tice in looking over that argument and j
resume of the various prohibition stat- j
utes, that in one state they permit you
to have a gallon a day, and then in
some you are permitted to have as
many as sixty pints of beer in a month,
either in bottles or in kegs. Just think
what a great prohibition state that is,
and it is risrht. The idea of permit
ting a fellow to have only a gallon of
beer a month. Why, the proposition is
absurd and ridiculous. Now, sixty
pints will sorter do, because that is
the average of two a day. Of course,
a teliow could not have any friends
with that sort of proposition, but then
ho n little sp-lfish and set
along with it tolerably well. And, you
know, t'nat I am Dutchman enough to
belie-ve that it would be better for the
human kind to drink two pints of beer
a day, than to dope on coca cola every
day, as they are doing now.
?c?
And then I see where they are going
f to regulate th? temperature in cotton
| mills- and send an inspector out to see
| that the law is eniorcea. i was jus>i
j wondering how they would enforce
I that law about stopping one minute a:
! all railroad crossings. Wno will be
there to see that each automobile stops
one minute, or for that matter, stops
at all. And they are proposing to
send an inspector around to see that
no one makes a false statement in order
to get free tuition in the colleges.
My, won't there be lots of jobs, because
they will 'have to send some fellow
around to see that the other felaq}

thing of making jobs end. It will be
? -u. foot cnir? in his an
?)<Ji LCi line wai, n.uv .. |
about books?to the making of jobs
there is no end. I was just wondering
who would be left to work to make
the money to pay the taxes with which
to pay all these fellows who are going
to get jobs. Well, now, wouldn't it be
nice to be in favor with the appointing
power, with all these jobs going the
- - - .1 - ?i I
rounds, and then l wouldn't c;ire wuere i
the money came from, just so it didn't |
fail to come. But I promised not to J
write anything about politics, and I
reckon I better keep that promise, for
when a fellow gets to talking about
something of which he .knows nothing
lie soon finds himself lost. But I do
read the papers a little, and I just
can't help thinking what has become
of the common sense of at least half
of the fellows t'Lac we?or the people?
send to the state house in Columbia to
make our laws. I reckon every fellow
feels that he must do something to
immortalize himself, and to do so he i
must pass a law and have it tagged
the Jones bill or the Smith bill, or
whatever his name might be. Well,
it is all right. I don't blame 'em. I
reckon I'd do the same thing if I was
there. We are all built very much
alike, except I sometimes think I am
a little more old timey?a little out of
date, perhaps.
Rnt. t.alkinsr about passing a law to
require automobiles- to stop for one
minute at every railroad crossing, reminds
me that we have in Newberry
slow down ordinances, and stop ordinances,
and so on. Or I judge we
have by the signs I see at some of the
corners?you know, the editor says the
? ?t>a+ nr?ir>
town IS saving muuej uj uvu i/xiii -,
ing some of the ordinances, at least?
| any way these big black signs are
posted at several of the street crossings,
and I wonder if they are enforced.
And, you know, we have sev- j

nances of the town. I am not cam plaining
about tnis ordinance, or any
other. I always' stop, look, list-en,
when I come to a street crossing, and
then I am not on the street a great
deal, but the point is, if such little
ordinances are not observed in he
town, how in the world are you going
ro have them observed in the country?
I have heard that there is some sort
cf speed law 011 the statute books now,
but *f there is, there* ih- no particle of
attention gken to it. The man or
driver that would go on to a railroad
track when a train was near enough
to strike his car, will pay very .little
attention to a law that requires him to
stop for a whole minute. Suppose we
all agree to leave a little something
for the good judgment and common
sense of the individual citizen, it
would probably be a rank presumption
to suppose that he had even a little
bit of common sense, but when he finds
that the state is not going to play
wet nurse for him any longer he may
be able to take care of himself.
But I reckon I am all out of joint
with the timi-s. and don't know what
I am talking about. So let's forget all
about this, and every one buy a ticket
and go to "Fee-Fee"?I believe I saw
that was what you are to call it. -Alnyway.
I mean t'ne play that the Calvin .
Crozier chapter is going to give some
time soon. , If they are going to give
it you may bet your bottom dollar
that its all right.
Then let's all of us help Mayor
Wright to save some money for the
town, and go to work when we save
it and, spend it on the improvement
of the streets and the roadways and .
in the general appearance of things
about town. It won't be long before
there should be something doing about
The Idler's park. I suppose the committee
still has the land, and that
when the spring time comes again we
will want to make some improvements
down there, and fix it up a little to
make a pleasant and comfortable place
for those of us who are not able to
go to the mountains when the good old
summer time comes along.
