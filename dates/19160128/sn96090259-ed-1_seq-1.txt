BLACK HILLS PEOPLE AWAKE
Federated Clubs Going After More Tourists
and More Business
"The people of the Black Hills are
thoroughly alive to the possibilities of
their oountry as a pleasure resort that
will attraot the people early and keep
them throughout the season," said
George Schlosser yesterday upon his
return from a several days' visit to that
seotion of the state. "It is not alone
the tourists they are going after, how
ever, but permanent, business as well.
They are awake to the f*cir, that there
are great opportunities for farther de
velopment there, They are beginning
to feel the good effeots of good times in
the eastern part of the state and feel
like meeting outside capital and busi
ness enterprise half way."
Saturday Mr. Schlosser was a guest
and spoke upon two business propo
sitions at the annual meeting of the
Hot Springs commercial club which
included as guests the officers of the
federated olubs of the Black Hills. He
described the meeting an being of

Theie one thing about Mr. Head
that ah people must admire and that
is that while he spares no one in his
attaoks upon sin there is nothing of
the element of abuse about it, as is the
case with so many evangelists. A num
ber of people who have heard Billy

perior jn many ways. He is certainly
an entertaining and interesting speak

miss hearing him. Hot Springs is de

HICK FOR

POPULAR ATTORNEY WILL MAKE
RACE FOR OFFICE
GOOD MAN FOR PLACE
WILL HAVE THE SUPPORT OF PROM
INENT MEN IN BOTH CUSTER AND
FALL RIVER C0UK1IES
Altho making no formal announce
ment as yet of his oaudidaoy, it is
understood that Attorney Lawrence
Uedrick will be the republican can
didate for the oflioe of state senator
from this district comprising Fall River
and Custer counties.
Mr. Hedrick is one of the strongest
men, if not the strongest man available
for tho place and when this is said it
is done so advisedly and most of our
readers will agree with us when a few
of the reasons are enumerated.
First. The next session of the legis
lature is one iu which this seotion is
vitally interested. New irrigation laws
will have to be introduced before our
big irrigation proj»ot can become a
fact,
Seoond. This seotion is in need of a
man who oan get what he goes after
and whose acquaintanceship is of
oroad enough 6cope to enable him to
be a power iu the senate.
Third. Our state institutions iu this
district, suoh as the State Home, the
Tuberoular Hospital, aud the expeii
mental farm need adequate appropri
ations and it will need a strong man to
see that fro get them.
Fourth, fifth, et al. Lawrence lled
rick is the man who measures up to
these requirements. He is au excel
lent speaker and could properly pre
sent his issues on the floor of the sen
ate, he is aggressive, a faot admitted
by both friends aud others aud bis ac
quaiutanoeship oovers the entire state
pretty thoroughly by reason of his ex
tensive law practice and his being one
of the high offloials in the South Da
kota National Guard.
He has the very strongest endorse
ment and backing throughout Custer
county and it goes without saying that
he is the man Fall River county nants
and needs for the place.
We predict that he will represent
this distriot in the next senate.
