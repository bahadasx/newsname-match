mt -o - i
Friday evening to play the boys
J . -"O " f tl
and girls of the Newport high
school inese young laaies
and gentlemen showed the spirit
of true ' sports.- Friday was a
real stormy day but this did not
dampen the spirits, or ardor of
these young people. Mrs. Fen
ton Starr was chaperon for the
girls and Prof. Doan, principal
of the Waldport high school, had
charge of the- boys. ': They
came up In open wagons in the
rain and storm but being full of
the spirit of the game, never felt
the storm and the Doty ' line
never, falls. They, were re

bey, where a warm supper Was
awaiting them and a kind recep
tion given to all the members ot
the visiting teams. .The game
"was the most interesting and
spirited ever played in Newport.
The - girls played first. The
score stood 13 to 5 in favor of
Newport. After the girls game
ended the boys took the floor.
At the conclusion of a hotlv con
tested game the scoie stood 27
to lij in -favor or the Newport
team. Edward Starr of Wald
port was referee and Prof. Glenn
of Newport was -umpire. A
dance was given at the Elk Hall
ln honor of the visiting teams.
A good crowd was' In attendance
and good music furnished and
a splendid time was had by all
present. On Saturday morning
the Waldport teams started
home in one of the greatest rain
and wind storms that ever vis
ited this coast. The wind was
blowing, at the rate of 70 milea
an hour and the rain was falling
In torrents. The young people
crossed the bay In the Mud Hen.
The waves ln the bay rolling and
breaking at least six feet high.

seemed to be hazardous, but no
one appeared to be the least
alarmed. If anything, the girls

The Newport teams will play

also be a hotly contested game
as Waldport will play to get
even and win the championship
of the county.
Saturday evening a grand
musicale was given at. the Mid
way theatre, for the benefit of
the Episcopal Church. The
exercises commenced by a
inarch, played by Mrs. Seley and
Mrs. A. Miller. - Mr. Burton
sang a solo, en titled "Sailing."
This was Mr. Burton's first ap
pearance on a Newport stage.
He was greeted with loud ap-1
plaus and encored. Song "Good
tM v. siniia was
well received. Song, "There
Let Me Rest," by Elmer Patrick.
Mr. Patrick has a rich, musical
voice and he always pleases his
audience. Song, "To You," by
Mrs. Dive.blss. This lady is
one of Newport's best singers
and she is always appreciated
and encored. Rev. E. T. Simp
son, rector of the Church, gave
a very humerous selection. Mr.
Simpson is an able and polished
speaker and his presence adds
much o the ministeral force of

This weather is hard on stock

takes so much extra feed.. The

which is quite an expense by the
time it Is delivered and ln the

several head of cattle. .
Mr. Whited from Jefferson
was in this locality last week
looking for a ranch. He wished
to Duyuiere on tne coast as no

cold. We are sorry he landed
here on the morning -after tho

things did not look very Inviting.
