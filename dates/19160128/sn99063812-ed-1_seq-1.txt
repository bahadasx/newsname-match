Not 411 of the twenty-two head of
cattle lost at the James N. Glvana
innch at Bly arc cattle that were
brought in from Harney county last
summer and were possibly infected
thore, according to E. T. Averlll, field
agent of the United States biological
survey, who has Just returned from a
trip of Inspection to tho Bly country.
, Seven of the cattle wero of the Fin
icy hctd. Qlvens Is occupying the
iFinley ranch at this time.
' "A peculiar fact regnrdlng the mal
ady nt Bly is that tho head of one ot
the effect cd cows, which was allowed
to die, was sent to Health Officer Ro
bert? of tho state livestock board, .and
hU microscopic examination failed to
And rny negrl bodies," said Averlll
this morning. "In the case of Infect
ed cattle, these bodies are easily
found, so It may bo that some other
ngoni than hydrophobia Is responsi
ble for the loss ol 'twenty-two head of
cattle.
"While I was at Bly Clarence Tay
lor killed a coyote, which bad many
symptoms of rabies. This animal
walked Into Taylor's yard; apparently
mtcoiiBclous of its surroundings, and
after it was shot Its tongue bung out
onn side of Its mouth, and was bitten
through. I have sent tho brain to Dr.
Kobcrg for examination. I also sent
in mo Dram oi a cow xuai was aiioweu
to die, nnd which exhibited peculiar
syriptoms.
"1 And the Bly people are quickly
responding to all suggestions. Harry
Telford, who was sent there by Dr.
Iluut, you health officer, did com
mendable work In warning stockmen
and others to confine animals and
r.iurtle dogs.
In my opinion the quarantine on
dogs should extend all over Eastern
Oregon where rabies Is not reported.'
Averlll cautions people against klll-
Iiib animals supposedly suffering with
ruble. Ho asks all to allow these to
die, and then send their brain to Dr.
Roberg, Selling Budding, Portland,
for examination. Many make tho mis
take ot shooting the animals through
tho head, shnterlng the brain and
finking examination Impossible.
Averlll left this morning for Salt
Lake, In response to a telegraphic or
der for his attendance at the confer
once of officials of Utah, Nevada, Ida
ho rnd California, to make plans for
coping with the rabies situation.

Several Plans AreTalked
for Pasturing Young Elk
By W. A. DELZELL j
(President Klamath Sportsmen's As
sociation) Now that we are assured of the
herd of elk for Klamath county,
which have been secured through the
activities of the Sportsmen's Associa
tion and the personal efforts of Com
missioner Stone, the matter ot caring
tor thorn after their arrival Is a ques
tion ot prime importance tor our
sportsmen to settle. The president of
the association will soon call a mass
meeting of the members to discuss
the matter fully, and It Is desired that
every member ot tho association, as
well as any others interested will be
present.
Several plans are under considera
tion, and It will be up to the sports
men to decide on the one most feasi
ble and act aoordlngly.
One plan advanced Is to use Stukel
mountain as a range for them. The
elk to be first kept in an enclosed pas
ture on some ranch at the base of the
mountain, and fed until spring before
being liberated.
The old Stukel ranch, now owned
by J. A. Maddox, has been suggested
by some aa Ideal for the temporary
care of the herd before turning out
on the adjacent mountain range. Stu

on the grounds of Insufficiency of wa-

tion, March 10th. '
tering places in dry seasons, as well
as lack of heavy timber for cover.
v Another plan advanced Is to have
the elk cared tor at the Slsemore
ranch In Wood River Valley, and ln
the Spring turn the elk out In the
Seven Mile country, which by some
Is held to be Ideal elk range in sum
mer. The objections raised to this
are that next winter the elk, being
forced to seek other range by the
heavy snows, might wander over to
the other side of the Cascade range,
and be lost to Klamath county.
Yet another plan Is to turn them out
on tho east side of the take, near Al
gomn, and let them range east. Thla
seems quite feasible the main objec
tion being Its proximity to the reser
vation, where the Indians might make
nway with them.
Still another proposition Is to en
close a forty-acre tract or more on
the west side ot the river near town,
and confine the elk there for some
time, feeding them )n addition to the
natural herbage. '
Theso various plans will be dis
cussed and any others that aaaybe
advanced and from them all the beet
will be chosen, and the united aim-1
