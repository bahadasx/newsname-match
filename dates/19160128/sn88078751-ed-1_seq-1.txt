Tokyo's Proposals
The Upper Hand
"Washington, Jan. 27. The officials
of the state department are deeply
Interested In the report from London
that the Japanese government has re
vived all of the demands upon China
Included In the famous "group five"
of tho list of proposals submitted to
the Pekln government more than a
year ago for a permanent settlement
of outstanding Issues between Japan
and China.
There is a conviction in olclal cir
cles liere that any action at this time
likely to have results toward waidlnp,
off the new Japanese demands must
be taken by the United States prac
tlcally alone. With every evldenco ot
sympathetic Interest by the European
entente allies in the attitude-ot-oppo-sitlon
which the United States as
sumed when the proposals in "group
five" originally were submitted, It Is
believed that none of these powers
will be inclined to take issue with
Japan at a moment when they are
leaning heavily upon their oriontal
ally not 'only for munitions of war,
but for military and naval protection
of their interests in the orient.
The vei;y close study that has been
made in Washington of the proposals
embodied In "group five" has only
confirmed officials in their original be
Uof that if accepted in full by China,
without protest from other nations,
they would lead not only to material
and industrial but even political dom
inatlpn of China by Japan. Japanese
advisers for the Chinese government,
with the resulting exclusion of all
other foreign ad isers from Pekin, It
is felt, would place China completely
under the political control of Japan.
While not prepared to make an is
sue on that point, however, the state
department is convinced that the oth
er provisions of "group five" finally

and enterprise the open door in

It is gathered from the British
newspaper advices that in addition to
reviving the demands in "group five'
as they stood at the close of the nego

Japanese proposals again Include a
provision aimed at a budding Ameri
can enterprise in Fukien province and
a proposal to police all of the large
Chinese cities with Japanese.
In the absence of official advices in
a matter of such importance, officials
positively decline to indicate what
course will bo followed by the United

BRITISH DEPRESSED
Relief Force Twenty-three Miles"
Below Kut-el-Amara,
London, Jan. 27. Official admission
ot a mistake, made by the India office
in its public reports concerning the
operations in Mesopotamia changed
the outlook for the British army in
that theater of war from one of cheer
ful optimism to one of the deepest
gloom. The admission means, In
short, that the relief force under Gen
eral Aylmer Is not, as had been offi
cially reported several times In the
last ten days, six miles east of Kut-el-Amara,
but twentv-three miles be
low that position, where the main
British army has been bottled up by
the Turks for more than a month. It
means, moreover, that the closest the
relief force ever advanced toward
Kut-el-Amara Is about twenty miles,
near Shlek Said, where a strong Turk
ish army is entrenched.
Officials high In the councils of the
government made no effort to conceal
the gravest alarm over this sudden
revelation. The admission of tho
"misunderstanding" changes whole
aspect of the situation, not only in
Mesopotamia, but in the Caucasus
and in Persia, these three theaters of
war being absolutely interdependent.
A Turkish official statement receiv
ed hero via Berlin reports an unsuc
cessful British attack on the Turkish
positions at Menlarle, In which tho
attackers suffered "appalling losses.''
Hand-to-hand fighting between the
Fronch and Germans near Neuvllle
took place when the French tried to
letake trenches captured from them
by the Germans. Berlin reports that
all the attacks were repulsed.

Gormans admitted that they were en

funds to defend German-Americans of
this country from any such "asper
sions as had been cast upon them by
President Wilson" in his last message

of the German organizations through

set to work to appeal for funds and
request for aid' is being made to every

NO FORMAL BLOCKADE

London, Jan. 27, The speeches ot
Sir Edward Grey, in the house of com
mons, and of the Marquis of Lans
down, minister without portfolio, in
tho house of lords, on the blockade
policy of Great Britain, dispelled all
hopes among those favoring a formal
blockade of Germany that the govern
ment would push such action. The
foreign secretary made the following
statement: "A thorough Investiga
tion by the. government of the situa
tion with regard to shipments to Ger

is being done without causing serious

S
ISSING
ACCUSED
WILL RELY UPON
THE INCOME TAX
House Democrats Against Hew
Excises to Pav For Defense,
LEADERS ARE SO INFORMED
Bill Increasing Income Tax Rates by
150 or 200 Per Cent Likely to Be
Drawn Up by the Ways and Means
Committee and Presented to the
House Caucus Would Force Wealth
to Pay For Defense.
Washington, Jan. 27. Develop
ments indicate that the Democrats of
the house Vlll reject President Wil
son's suggested revenue program and
insist that the Income tax be relied
upon to finance the national defcuse
expenditures.
This information resulted from a
careful canvass of the situation In the
house made by the foremost Demo
cratic leaders. It developed that fully
fifty members have written letters lo
the house leaders expressing their' de
termination to vote against all new
excises or other revenue legislation
designed to pay for the army and
navy Increases except changes in the
income tax law. It was said authori
tatively that fully fifty members, in
addition to the number who have
'written formal letters to the house
leaders, entertain the same determin
ation. As a result of this development. It
was said on high authority that the
ways and means committee is likely
to present to the house caucus a bill
increasing income tax rates by 150 or
200 per cent. The committee will re
port such a measure not because of
tny conviction on the part of the ma
jority that other proper sources of
taxation for defense are not available,
hut in recognition of the sentiment
among the Democratic membership of
the house.
The leaders of the committee, in
cluding Majority Leader Kitchin, are
convinced that the revenue measure
to be framed at this congress must
bo u measure for which the support
of practically every member of the
Democratic caucus can be secured.
One of the leaders of the committee
pointed out that If as many as four
teen members of the caucus aro op
posed to a revenue measure presented
from the ways and means committee
the measure may fall of passage In
the house because of their defection.
It would be the policy ot majority
leadership to frame a bill embodying
every concession necessary to secure
the undivided approval of the house
caucus.
The measure which the ways and
means committee Is now Inclined to
report in answer to the demand of
the house Democrats will not provide
for lowering the present income tax
exemptions. The sentiment which de
mands that Incomes shall bear the
expense of the national defense in
creases is a sentiment for the taxa
tion of wealth.
Not only doej there seem to be
among house pemocrats a sentiment
for forcing wealth to pay the cost of
additional instrumentalities of de
fense, but there is a demand for the
repeal of the present excises levied
by the bo called war tax law. It is
now probable that the present house
will repeal this law, which was re-en-actPd
In December
SHIP PURCHASE BILL UP
Prospects For Its Passage Held to Bs
Bright.
Washington, Jan. 27. Prospects for
passage of a government ship pur
chase bill are believed to be bright by
administration leaders, who saw In
conferences President "WllBon had
with Democrats who opposed such a
measure last year Indications that
united support for the revised pro
posal eventually would be won. Some,
however, are still opposed to govern
ment operation of shipu.
The president continues to urge
leading members of congress to hast
en action on Important legislation. Ha
discussed the ship bill particularly
with Majority Leader Kitchin of tho
house and Senator Clarke of Arkan
sas. Later Representative Kitchin
Bald the bill. If presented as outlined
to him, would receive his support.
Senator Clarke would not discuss it,
hut some of his friends said they be
lieved the measure could be submitted
in tho form to meet his approval.

HAS CHANGED
HIS MIND.
s
President Wilson Gives Ex
planotion Of His View
Gives Reasons For Favoring:
Creation of Tariff Board.
WORLD CONDITIONS ABNORMAL
President Denies, However, That In
Changing His Vlaws In Regard to
tre Question of a Tariff Board That
His Attitude Toward the Policy
of Protection Has Been Affected.
Writes Letters to Kitchin.
Washington, Jan. 27. President
Wilson made public two letters writ
ten by him to Majority Leader Kitch
in, explaining his views as to tho need
for a tariff board.
In one of these letters President
Wilson frankly acknowledges that he
Las reversed himself on this Import
ant subject. He explains his change
of front on the ground that condi
tions throughout the world have
changed. President Wilson denies,
however, that in changing his mind
on the subject of the tariff board that
his attitude on the question of protec
tion has been affected.
In the first letter to Mr. Kitchin the
president suggested legislation for the
creation of a tariff commission, which
commission shall provide the govern
ment with the necessary data to fur
nish a sound basis for the policy
which should be pursued by the coun
try in the years immediately ahead.
The president in his second letter
gives his reasons for changing his
mind on the question of creating a
tariff commission. He says: -
"I have changed my mind because
all the circumstances of the world
have changed, and It seems to me
that. In view of the extraordinary and
far-reaching changes which the Euro
pean war has brought, it is absolutely
i.ecessary that we should have a com
petent instrument of Inquiry along'
the whole line of the many questions
which affect our foreign commerce.
"I have had in this change of mind
no thought whatever ot a change of"
cltitude ton arils the so called pro
tection question A commission such'
83 I have suggested would have noth
ing to do with theories of policy. They
would deal only with facts, and the
facts which they would seek ought
to be the actual facts of Industry and
of the conditions of economic ex
change prevailing in the world, so
that legislation of every kind that
touched tbese matters might be guid
ed by the circumstances disclosed lw
its inquiries.
"I dare say you feel as I do, that
i! would be folly at this time, or untilf
nll the altered conditions are cloarly
vnderstcod, to attempt to deal with'
questions of foreign commerce by leg
islation, and yet, having dealt direct
ly and clearly with the whole ques-
! lion of unfair competition within our"
own borders. It is clear that as soon
as we know the facts wo ought to'
deal with unfair methods of competi
tion as between our own nation and
others and t--is is only one of the
many things that we would pro&ably
vish to deal with. The other mailers
I have attempted to indicate In m
previous letter to you. I am glad to
Kupplcmont that letter by"thls explicit
statement of the considerations which -have
been most influential with me." '
