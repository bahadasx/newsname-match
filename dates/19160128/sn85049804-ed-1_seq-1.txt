a just fight and a cause no man
should be ashamed of, and yet are
we, as citizens of Iowa, doing our
duty? Can we expect Woodson and
Brown to watch the corrupt and dis
criminating laws against our people
before the legislature in this state,
when very often the have to spend
their own money for hotel bills and
railroad fare in the same cause. I
for one think the time has come for
the men of Iowa to shoulder some of
the responsibility, by chipping in a
few dollars to hel psome one fight)
for us, while we are not able to fight
for ourselves. Who will take the
lead? I am a good follower and
make this appeal to the men of our
race

RUSH CANDIDATE FOR JUDGE.
We take great pleasure in announc
ing that James B. Rush is a candidate
for municipal judge of our city, sub
ject to the city primaries March 13.
Under the new city law there will be
four city judges to be elected and we
honestly think it but just that there
should be one colored man, and, too,
Lawyer Rush has by his many years
of practice proven fully competent to
discharge every duty. He has lived
and practiced law for nearly twenty
years in our city and is thoroughly
acquainted with every branch of Ouxi
courts. He is a temperance man, ac
tive in church and social reform work.
The colored voters should all work
for his nomination and we commend
him to the white voters as worthy of
their hearty support.

FORT MADISON NOTES.
(Last Weekj)
Friends will be surprised to hear
of the death of Mrs. Merle Basfield
Moore, which occurred at the Sacred
Heart hospital in this city last Fri
day. Mrs. Moore was sick but a
short while and her death came as a
great shock to every one. She was a
loveable young woman and will be
greatly missed by her many friends.
Those attending the funeral of Mrs.
Moore from out of the city were Mr.
Arthur Moore (husband), Mr- M.
Moore, Mrs. Bettie Bannister of Rock
Island, 111., Mrs. Griggsby (grand
mother) and Mrs. K. Johnson of Keo
kuk. Mrs. Moore was born in Mus
catine, Iowa, February 15, 18S5, and
was nearly 81 years of age at tlte
time of her death. She leaves her
mother, Mrs. N. A. Ison, For4, Madi
son husband, Arthur Moore, Rock
Island Raymond Cranshaw (neph
ew), and Freida Range (cousin), both
of this city. The many friends of the
bereaved ones, and especially of Mrs.
Ison, the mother, freely express their
deep sorrow and sympathy. It was
just about one year ago that Mrs.
Ison was bereaved by the loss of an
other daughter, which makes this a
burden, not easily borne The sweet
disposition of Mrs. Moore certainly
justified the comparison of her life
to a "sunbeam."
Mrs. D. Ison and Miss Jennie Har
per are planning the organization of
a children's club among the colored
children of the city.
We are glad to know that Mr.
Garret Dunlap has entered high school
for the last semester.
Mrs. A. Jackosn, who has been very
sick, is able to be up and around
again.

pices of the People's Foruw, is now in
session at the Second Baptist church.

erary at the A. M. E. church next
Thursday.
