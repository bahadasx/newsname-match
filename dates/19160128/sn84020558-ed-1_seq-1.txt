NKW VOWC. Jan. S7. - President
"Wilson tonight opened his nominal
appeal lo the country for national de
fense. He gave warning that plans for
readjustment of the army must be
formulated and carried out without
delay, and solemnly declared In' could
not predict that th,e outlook for the
Pnited States would be as bright to
morrow as today. Speaking at a
banquet of the Railway Business as
sociation and the Motion Picture
Hoard of Trade, ho sounded the key
not of addresses that he will deliv
er during the next 1I days in the
middle west.
-Mr. Wilson was in a fighting mood
throughout his address. In a speech
delivered early in the day he declared
he always accepted an invitation to
fight. Tonight he told the Railway
men he whs an advocate of peace and
had struggled to keep the United
States at peace, hut he considered tile
lil.erty and honor of the nation even
more important than peace.
"Woe to any man who plays mar
plot or who seeks to make party, po
litical or personal ambition take pre
cedence over candor, honor and un
selfish, unpartisan service." said the
president in speaking of his defense
Plan before the railroad men. He
.declared that the country expects an
accounting; this is a year of account
ing, and the accounting must be defi
nite on the part of the parlies and on
the part of every individual who
wishes to enjoy the public confidence.
"For my part, 1 hope every man in
public life will get what's coming to
him," said Air. Wilson, amid laughter
and applause.
The president at both banquets and
all during his day's visit to .v York
was greeted with enthusiasm. In his
ride between the hotels where the
banquets w ere held tonight, he was es-I
oorled by a band and the Ninth com- j
pany of Coast Artillery of the New'
York National guard. Thousands of ;
persons packed the streets and
cheered him as he went by. j
During his speech before nearly
l.TiflO business men at the Railway
banquet, where he cast aside almost '
entirelv the text of the address thatltal thing. How can
he had previously prepared for de-
livery there, he wits frequently in
terrupted by applause.
The president admitted that in a
message to the last congress he had
said tint necessity for preparedness
was not pressing. He declared that!
he had learned differently in the
meantime. He cited his recent sup- j
port of a tariff commission as an- I
other Instance of a change on his 1
part, hut declared that previously
there was no need for such a com- i
mission. I
Mr. Wilson spoke of men of high
character who were clouding the pre-
paredness issue. He declared they
were provincial, and that the Pnited
States must no longer cut itself off)
from the rest of the world. j
Tiie president vigorously discussed
his .Mexican policy. He asserted that
to invade Mexico would mean the
losing of confidence of the rest of
the western hemisphere. He cited
the freeing of Cuba as an instance of
good done l y the Pnited States.
"If we are draw n into the mael
strom tthich now surges in P.urope,"
the president dfclared. "we shall not
be permitted to do the high things
we would prefer."
The president defended the conti
nental army plan drawn up by Sec
retary Garrison and said that he did
not care about the details of any
plan as long as ruiO.OOO trained men
were provided as reserves under the
federal goveriimnt. IK' advocated
strngthening the national guard, but
said the constitution itself,' put the
guard under the state. He added that
the Pnited States will not turn in
the direction of militarism. .
Outlining why the Pnited States
should prepare, Air. Wilson said, "We
must prepare our rights as a nation
and the rights of our citizens in
America and outside of it as the con
sensus of civilized peoples has de
fined them must ensure the unem
barrassed realization of our political
development within our own borders,
anl must protect the peace and polit
ical autonomy of the Americas.
Industrial preparedness, with the
military training of students in in
dustrral schools was proposed by the
president. He left navy plans foi"
later addresses.

on protective measures in their deal
ings with the foreign powers were

DF STORMS. SAYS WOOD TO CunGRESS
(Republican A. P. Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Jan. S.7. The posi
tion of the ("niied States in a war-torn
world was described to the house mili
tary committee today by Major Gen
eral Leonard Wood as like, that of "a.
shin at sea, with typhoon signals com
ing from many directions."
"We arc living in an era of war." he
said, "and gradually are accumulating
most of the troubles of the world."
General Wood, who appealed at the
committee's hearings op. the army in
crease bills, repeated in the main the
testimony he previously had given he
fore ti e senate military committee, flo
said it would take an army of a mil
lion and a halt' to cold a line from Bos,
ton south. Should conditions nt the
close of the war in Fiiropo invite at
tack, he declared, the more powerful
of the belligerents coulu land r.m),oio
me'i on .American soil in less than 30
days.
A tvg'i'ar army of sjiohiii, fully
trained ami ulwitvs miner arms, with
at least ,oiici(Hin reserves behind them
should be provided, he urged, to mee t
this situation. The Pnited States

He said American business
should be able to hold their
against the world.
