taken with hltrj for Investments. It
was gone lost. Father died. Mother
found barely enough left to support
her. TO reliove her you consented
to take the children."
; "Wanted them, you mean. I was
delighted to have the dear little ones
to care for."
"Well, I may as well break the final
bad news," went on John desperately-.
"Mother's millinery venture has failed.
She can struggle on no longer and
hold on! where are you going?" for
Mary was flitting away fast as she
could go.
"Where am I going?" she chirped
vivaciously. "Why, to get the eparet
room ready and comfortable fast as 1
can, of course. Why, sir, do you tbinlc
I am going to have honored company
catch me unprepared?"
"You angel!" voiced John Rice. "You
have brought nothing hut brightness
and blessings to anyone coming near
you!"
John's mother was settled In the
very best room in the house. New Ufa
seemed to Inspire her, with her chil
dren restored to her, and Mary's con
stant cheerful smile brought radiant
sunshine to her drooping spirit.
Things were not going well with
John. A cut In salary made him look
serious, hut Mary declared It possible
to meet the grocery bill without de
priving thern of enough to eat. The
mother contributed a few dollars a
month to the household from doing
some sewing, but John was worried,
for It looked vague and dark ahead.
Then carae a new surprise, and com
plication", and burden. The brother of
Mary was crippled in an accident at
the mills where he had worked. The
doctor said he would be an invalid
for about a year, Harry Estee could
get around well enough, but he could
not do the hard work his former posi
tion had required. ,
Harry was cutting away a dangling
piece of a shoe sole when old Mrs
Rice noticed the fact.
"Why, Harry, your shoes are pre.t7
well gone up, aren't tbey?" she re-
marked.
'That for some time," Harry tried
to say lightly.
I was thinking," proceeded Mrs.
Rice reflectively. "I have some clothes
and such up In the old trunk of my
dead husband. Yes, and I ara certain
there is a pair of shoes he wore. They
are not new, but certainly better than
those you are wearing. If th7' fit
yoil, they might do. Walt I II ro and
look thetsi up."
Mrs. Rice proceeded to the attic.
She returned shortly with the pair of
shoes she had described and handed
them to Harry.
"Why, they fit Just famously." he
declared, as he tried one on. They
wotjM do me for six months If they
were patched up a little. I helped the
old shoemaker on Central street carry
in some leather supplies a few days
since. He told me that made me a
free customer in the way of repairs I
mlfdit need. I'll go and see him now."
The shoemaker was true to hi
promise. Harry sat in nis siocams;
feet as the artisan began work on the
shoes.
The worker had found the sole of
the shoe quite regular and ordinary.
When he came to the other, however.
it held fast and firm and he had to
dig hard to loosen two thin plates of
steel. He drew them out. Betweea
them lay a little package, done up In
oilskin. -
"Whoever wore these shoes used
this sole for a pocketbook," observed
the cobbler, as he handed the oilskla
packet to Harry.
The latter unfolded it. Within rest
ed a note! or a check! No, a certi
ficate of deposit on an Oregon bank
for thirty thousand dollars!
Harry knew enough of the history
of the Rice family to 'read the oraclf)
promptly. He uttered an excited yell.
Then. In his stocking feet, he made a
dash for home.
The agitated Mrs. Rice insisted on
going straight to the local bank to ba
nssured the certificate waj good.
There she left It for Collection "halt
to John and Mary," she directed.
"If we hadn't taken in the children,
mother would never have come, nor
the old shoes," reasoned the happy
Mary. ' And, oh, John, see the grand
fortune that has come to us for duty
well performed!"
