HOW TO FEED CROSBY'S
READY RATION
In feeding Crosby's Ready
Ration it is well to remember
that no other feed is required to
be mixed with it; it cannot be
improved by the addition of
other feeds. If, however, you
4bave home-crown corn and
ats, or other feeds, it Is possible
ao use a certain quantity of your
home-grown feeds. Wherever
it is advisable to feed 10 lbs
Crosby's Ready Ration it would
require 6 lbs Crosby's Ready Ra
tion and 6 lbs Corn Meal mixed
together to produce the same
results as you would get from
10 lbs Crosby's Ready Ration.

QUESTION OF PREPAREDNESS,
President Garfield of Williams col
lege contributed to tho cditorinl page
of last Sunday's Boston Globe an ar
ticlo of notable strength and clearness
on the present movement for prepared
ncss nnd the nrguments which arc
urged in favor of it. Thoso who ndvo
cate tho building of a great pcrma
ncnt military and naval establishment,
like thoso of the European nntions,
President Garfield says, baso their ar
gumcnts on one of two assumptions
that wo arc in danger of invasion
from abroad, or that we may bo forced
into war by somo overt act like the
infringement of tho Monroo doctrine
With regard to n possible foreign in
vasion ho says that tho experts usif
ally baso their premises on an expedi
tionary force of 100,000 men as the
least number thnt nn enemy would nt
tempt to bring against us, and ho then
goes on to show what it would mean
to transport such a forco across the
ocean and land it with its modern and
indispensable equipment of horses,
nrms, field guns, siego guns, ammuni
tion and supplies of every kind. In
brief, according to tho estimate of a
military expert of unquestioned nu
thority, not leas than 250 ships would
bo required to transport the men and
horses, and it-would tako nt least as
many more perhaps oven twico ns
many to bring the big guns and tho
other military and naval equipment.
From this President Garfield's arti
cle goes on to show what tho problem
would be of landing the men, horses,
guns nnd equipment from the ships,
"drawn up in four lines, say one mile
from shore, and each line 10 miles
long. How mauy stretches of mum
shoro 10 miles long havo we?" It
would bo impossible for such a force
to be sent against us without warning
of it reaching this country in advance,
and it would hnvo our nnvy to reckon
with.
In tho second place President Gar
field shows tho extreme improbability
that nny ono of tho nations now at
war would attempt to attack us in tho
oxhaustcd condition which will inevit
ubly obtain at tho end of this conflict
whichever ono may bo victorious.
Modern history affords no examplo oi
any such ovent having occurred
Based on these two well-grounded
assumptions, President Garfield nrgties
thnt thero is no good reason why wo
should now cntor upon any such plan
of preparedness ns will imposo upon
our pcoplo a great permanent benumb
ing burden in mon and money such ns
is carried by tho nations across 'the
Eca. He has no sympathy with those
pacifists who would simply do nothing,
but on tho othor hand ho would not
hnvo us plungo rashly into a great
scheme of military expansion, tho bur
den of which must in tho end rest
most heavily on tho pcoplo of small
means on thoso who must work for
their daily bread. Ho would havo our
program of steadily increasing nnval
strength ndhorod to, nnd he would
hnvo our defences on both land anil
sea strengthened in every reasonablo
.way. Tho thing ho would not havo
our nation do is to rush blindly, on
tho impulse of the moment, into such
nn immediate scheme of military and
nnval onlnrgomont ns will plaeo us on
n footing with tho great powers across
tho water. Tho objection to such a
plan is by no menus purely n financial
ono its cost in monoy. It concerns
our national ideals of our American
democracy, which ought not thus lightly
to bo dopnrtcd from.
Tho sentiment of tho pcoplo as n
wholo should govern in an emergoncy
liko this. "Hnste is not necossnryj
moro expenditure of monoy is not pre
pnrednoss. We may with per
fect assurance of safoty devoto our
selves to n nation-wldo and thorough
discussion of tho wholo question of
propnrodnoss boforo ndopting a pro
gram." Such, in substnuco, is President
Garfield's lino of argument nnd the
conclusion which he reaches. His
words sooin to us to bo thoso of wis
dom, and wo suspoct it may provo in
tho end that they represent the sober
second thought of tho American peo
ple on this great question.
WHERE VERMONT LEADS.
Tho government reports just issued
show that Vermont is the chief live
stock raising state of Now England
and that it is advancing in this direc
tion remarkably as compared with
other near-by states. With tho rapid
lucreaso in tho use of motor cars ono
might expect to find tho number of
horses decreasing, but tho government
assures us that the number in New
England at the present time is 300,000,
a gain of 2,000 in fivo years. The
threo southern states of this section
havo 3,000 loss horses than half a do
cado ago, but Maine shows an in
crease of 1,000, New Hampshire 3,000
and Vormont 7,000. Rather curiously
tho loss in Massachusetts, Connccti-
cut and Rhodo Island is ascribed to
tho increasing uso of tho automobile,
but moro automobiles per capita aro
owned in Vermont than in any of
thoso states. Tho total number of
milch cows in New England is esti
mated at 825,000, or 3,000 less than
was recorded fivo years ago, and the
total number of "other cattle" is
500,000, against 490,000 fivo years be
fore. Tho valuo of milch cows had
advanced from $48.10 to $02.38, and
tho averago vnluo of "other cattle"
is much higher than before. Figuring
tho valuo of the dairy cattlo at nearly
$52,000,000, adding tho vnluo of the
other cattle, tho capital invested in
tho milk industry and other allied in
dustries, ono quickly finds that the in
vestment in cattlo and other associated
businesses is truly enormous. In fivo
years Rhode Island showed a loss of
1,000 in milch cowb Massachusetts a
loss of 15,000, Connecticut a loss of
3,000, whilo Maino gained 4,000, Now
Hampshiro 1,000 and Vermont 13,000.
Gov. Gates dropped a word of char
acteristic common sense on his Sons-of-
Vermont audionco in Boston tho othor
night when ho said that ho "would
liko to find out how a state can profit
ably iesuo C0-ycar .bonds to build roads
that will wear out in ten years." v'dr
mont's pay-ns-you-go way of stato
road improvement seems to be a good
one.
Vermonters who havo traveled much
bv nutomobilo in tho stato of New
York often wonder where tho money
comes from to build the great network
of good roads which covers tho main
highways of the state. The answer to
the question is found in the fact that
the state has made two $50,000,000
bond issues to build these roads. Be
sides this thero is nn arrangement by
which tho counties join with the state
in building certain roads; and, again,
tho individual towns mny make appro
priatious for county roads somewhat
after our Vermont plan, it would seem
Presidont Wilson is ono of the re
cent converts to tho plan for a seien
ti'fic, non-partisan tariff commission.
Ho probably realizes thnt tho tariff
policy which he espoused so many
years, find which ho tried out as soon
as he was elected, is not tho kind of
n tnriff tho United States should havo,
just as tho men on tho other sido of
tho fence know that a tariff of ex
tremo protection is not wholly right.
A scientific settlement of tho tariff, so
that it will produco tho necessary
revenue for tho government's oxpeascs
and at tho same timo protoct indus
tries which havo to compcto with con
cerns in other countrios under differ
ent working conditions cannot bo ob
tained politically. It must bo dono by
men who hnvo studiod tho wholo ques
tiou without tho bias of politics or
tho feor that thoy may loso their re
election by their acts.
Scaled Prison Wall.
Adelard Dupont, a convict at tho state
prison, who was supposed to havo es
caped last Saturday, scaled tho wall of
tho prison early Wednesday morning by
a ropo ladder which ho loft on tho
wall. Ho had been in hiding upon tho
prison promises for four dnys nnd
nights waiting for n. ehanco in make

Nineteon sixteen is ovidontly to soo

green, deadliest enemy of tho p. b., is

Tlio extinction was effected gradually.
Today thero is less than SOO pounds of

WAS ESCAPED PATIENT
Man Found with Both Feet Frozen
Got Away from Retreat
Pried Guard Off Window and Left
Early In Morning Has Dolusions of
Persons Trying to Kill Him.
Giovanni Ilattnini, who was found in n
mill in Marlboro witli both feet frozen nnd
was brought to tho Melrose hospital in
West Brattleboro, as reported on pago
7 of this paper, is an escaped patient
from tho Brattleboro Retrcaf.
One day early last week Battaini, who
had a room on tho first floor, got bold of
some implement witli which lie pried the
guard of! a window in his room. Ho pre
viously had obtained a suit of clothes nnd
a pair of shoes, and witli these nnd a
blanket lie departed through the window
early in the morning.
Having had delusions that ho was bcinc
pursued by persons bent on killing him,
Ilattnini had tried to hide himself at the
Retreat, so the officials knew what his
characteristics were and they had empty
buildings and various otticr places searched
in various towns and sent telephone mes
sages in various directions, but without
avail.
When tho findlnc o Battaini was
learned by Supt. S. E. Lawton ho tel
ephoned to Dr. E. R. Lynch of tho Mcl
roso hospital and easily identified tho
patient, who was returned to tho Re
treat yesterday.
liattnim is an Austrian, ns he told thoso
who found him in Marlboro. He formerly
was employed in Rendsboro, but developed
insanity and was brought to the Retreat in
March, 101 ii.
The South Ncwfano correspondent of
Tho Phoenix sends the following:
Tho Austrian, Giovanni Battaini, who
was found unconscious last Friday in J. O.
Metcalf's sawmill in Marlboro with feet
badly frozen nnd has since been taken to
the Melrose hospital, was seen passing
through this village on tho previous Mon
day. Because many foreigners pass
through, going to nnd from the lumber
camps during the winter, this was not
thought unusual. A number observed, how
ever, that his feet were not suitably clad
for intensely cold weather. His trousers
were short and he wore neither overshoes
nor leggings. The children who met him
said that he wore only thin stockings nnd
slippers on his feet. When found, tho
bottoms of these were nearly worn oft.
When seen hero his feet evidently wero
not frozen, as he walked without limping
nnd went directly past the houses ns if
knowing .where ho intended ( to pp. Jear
tho postoflice, wliere tlio roads divide, go
ing to Dover and Marlboro, he was seen to
stop and look first one way, then tho other.
Then he took the Marlboro Branch road.
Where he stayed from Monday until Fri
day and what he ate is a mystery. When
.found he could only crawl on his hands
nnd knees. If without food during that
time it is remarkable that lie escaped
without freezing to death.

the receivers thnt makes it impossible to
hear tho time signals flashed from Wash
ington. At no other time of the day or
night is this heard. There is never nny
difficulty in receiving the time at 10 p. m.
It was thought that the use of the X-ray
machine in tho Memorial hospital, often in
operation about noon, might in some way
interfere with the wireless, but it has been
proved that this is not the cause. The idea
that high tension wires might have some
thing to do with it is discarded because
of the fact that tho effect would bo heard
at other times than at noon.
A. M. Bennett of West Brattleboro, who
has a powerful receiving station at his
home, is not bothered materially by this
phenomenon, although he has heard it.
Homer Ellis, who had n wireless outfit on
the roof of tho next building to thnt in
which Vaughan & Burnett's store is locat
ed, has heard some slight disturbance at
times, but nothing liko thnt which inter
feres with the effectiveness of the Vnughnn
& Burnett apparatus at noon each day.
