f y' Such was one of the statements made by President VVi'sori, in
'one of the most solemn Earnings he has yet delivered to the nation
in the matter of necessity for preparedness for national defense.
Before an audience oi fifteen hundred persons, 'members of the
Railroad Business Men's Association and the Motion Picture Board
of Trade, the President launched his publicity campaign for support
for the" administration's preparedness program. ' The President
announced that he was in a "fighting
mood," and ; was enthusiastically ap
plauded up to the point whire he stat-
vii mat mere wouiu oe no invasion
of Mexico. As such a step would cost
us the confidence of the other Ameri

KaJ.l that he had sttiven hard'tof psacC,
believing last page topresents - the
real, fundamental spirit of the JJniUd
htatea as distinct from the noisy clam
or of the jingoes. : .-.
'I believe, 4,h told hi hearers,'
that the, people , of this country are
earnestly desirous of peeping even the
balance between the warring nations
in Europe." ' - .
It has been his belief h added that
peace, founded upon justice is the only
peace worth the having. , .
MI always accept an .invitation to
light," the President added, with a
smile," but I insist upon Conducting
my fiht with just' and fairness to
the other follow, na matter- what the
other fellow msy do. This, I take It
lfe the American way."'
I'ftoen hundred business men filled
the hull when Mr. Wilson entered to
make the opening address of bis pre-
J'arcd.icys -uiii p aign" last aignt. The
'resident was greeted -by prolonged
applause an, l it was some -time before
he wus uble to commence : his speech.
When the clamor died down he stepped
to the front of the platform and rais
ing his hand for silence, said:
Id a Mood for righting ,
"1 u m in a lighting mood tonight.
For twenty months. f have struggled
find battle, I to keep Ibis-eouutrv out
of war, to preserve is so far as I was
able, the spirit of the" commands laid
upon nit- ,v my oath Qf office, to avoid
strife nnd yet U keep honor. Now I
have ciiuie to a point where I believe
I must consider the threatened liberty
and honor of the nation, and I am pre
pared to tijiht if need be for that
liberty and honor which are more to
be desired than peace.' '
In a fow pluiu words, the President
then outlined the situation at home and
abroad, nnd warned his hearers that
there uiust bo no shillyshally about
preparedness. .' . --
"The plans for a greot more ef
fective military force now before con

which -to delay and palavar.
Can't Predict Futura v
"Wo are at peace with thr worlJ
tonight." he h.tid, "but neither we nor
any other men can tell how long that
peace is to last. I can not venture to
predict tl.nt the outlook for the United
States will be as bright tomorrow as
it is today. No one ran do that."

Thia brought forth round after rounj '
of cheering from the crowded scats. -'
When the applause ceased Mr. Wil
son began to praise Congressman Mann,'
floor leader of the Bepubliean party la
the house of representatives,1 for the ,
address made by him a few days ago, :
in which Mr. , Mana had advocated '
nonpartisan support of the military and '
naval plans of the administration. The
president said that he believed that
such a speech y would, bear splendid '
fruit. .vy.". . "."';
The President admitted that he had
in the past told - eongresa that pre
paredness was not a pressing need of
the nation.' He had behaved what ha
had said at that time, but he ha I
learned differently ainee thea, and hav
ing learned differently waa prepared to '
shoulder the blame for his mistake anl
was ready to do what he could to
rectify it.
Speaking of the plan of Secretary
Garrison for an army of trained mea
he said, while he believed that hia
plan is the best which can be secure,!
at present and xader all the condi
tions confronting ihs country, he per
sonally cares nothing for the-details, .
and will be satisfied if congress will
give the country legislation which will
provide us with aa army of 600,000
trained men ta act a reserves to our ,
regulars in tuna of trouble, reserved
capable of speedy . mobilisation . and
instnnt effectiveness.
American business men, he continue!,
have ia the past taken, their stand for
the policy of protection, a tariff wall be
hind which they stood, barring out the
rest of the commercial world. But times
hsve changed, especially since the out;
break of the war. . The great American
combinations of capital are now aeeklng
to gain a share of the world 'a trade. If
this Is to continue the people of the
country must realize that it means a,'
new foreign policy, and that they can.
no longer shelter themselves behind an
artificial barrier, but must go forth
prepared to meet the competition of oth- .
cr peoplei on the level of equal oppor
tunity. .This ia turn means added pos
sibility of war' with rival commercial
nations, he said.
Furthermore ha said, Americans havo
from the very begining of the history
of tho land, stood for libertv, As cham
pions of freedom here and everywhere
in the Western Hemisphere we have en
tered into two wars, the war with
Mexico and with Hpain over Cuba. Yet
