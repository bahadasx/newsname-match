Heavy Penalty
Given Erickson
Star Mirror.—Probably one of
the moB/ severe penalties ever im
posed in Latah county and perhaps
in the state of Idaho under a similar
charge was imposed on E. Erickson,
''■Helmer farmer, by Probate
' °$e Morgareidge this morning
f\ ^wing a preliminary hearing
when Erickson was charged by Coun
ty Attorney Frank L. Moore, with
contributing to the delinquency of
his own children by refusing or neg
lecting to send them to school.
ZJntil he complies with the proba
tion lawB of the state and places his
children in the public school, Erick
son ihust remain in jail to the ex
tent Öf six months and to pay a fine
of $200. The jail sentence im
posed by Judge Morgareidge was
conditional. If at any time during
his term of six months that he places
the children in school, the court will
suspend that uuserved portion of
the sentence.
The conviction of Erickson on this
charge is the culmination of sever
al years defiance of the probation
officials of the county by Erickson.
Frequently in the past several years
the probation officers have ordered
him to send his children to school,
hut he has paid no attention to the
demands. When the matter was
breached to County Attorney Moore
it was decided to take the steps pro
vided by law to give Erickson's
children an education. It is under
stood that similar action may be
taken against others in the county
who are delinquent in a like viola
tion.
Did that proposition of a good
road district for the Potlatch inter
est you? If so, let us hear from
you. Wake up, don't sleep away all
of your life. Lets hear from some
one on the subject, whether you are
in favor or against the subject. Let
it come.
The Gazette has been interviewed
by persons in this town in regard to
fijffag the roads and some of the
parties are heavy tax payers and
their view of the matter is to pave
the main part of town and rock the
balance of the streets. Here is an
other subject that is open to discus
sion and you are invited to make
known your thoughts on the matter
thru the columns of the Gazette.
The space is yours to use. If you
send an article in, sign your name
and if you wish it withheld, it will
be done, but we must have the name.

See America First
The Americans are now realizing
the scenic attractions of their own
country surpass those of any other
country in the world is shown by
the great number of tourists who
this year visited the twelve national
parks located in the west and under
the supervision of Uncle Sam. Of
these even dozen, Yellowstone Nat
ional Park, discovered in 1870, when
the Washburn—Doane exploring
party returned to Helena from a
months exploration of its thereto
fore occult and unique mysteries
and phonomena, and established in
1872, still remains the largest, hav
ing an area of over 5,300 square
miles, and Gardner, the original
northern entrance, on the Northern
Pacific Railway, remains the most
scenic entrance.
This year 1915 was a good one
for the various parks. The great
European war and the expositions
on the Pacific Coast forced or en
ticed an unusually heavy travel
westward. 51,895 tourists visited
Yellowstone this year—-a large in
crease over the 1914 season.
Parties who have pelts that are

P. S. Pease, of the American Type
Founders Company, was in this city
a few minutes Friday on his way to
Lewiston to take charge of the de
funct Lewiston Jourual, which was
strated in Lewiston a short time a
go. This old stunt of starting pa
pers to run out other papers in the
town or to run for the purpose of
getting some easy money in a cam
paign, is the wrong idea. Politics
are alright in their place but they
are so full of promises and no cash
that to expect to run a newspaper
on that stuff is foolishness.
It is claimed that more than 650,
000 shingles entered the United
States from Canada through the
town of Blaine and Sumas, Wash.,
during the year 1915. Under a
reasonable tariff law, it is probable
that these shingles would have been
manufactured in our country out of
American timber, and affording
work for American laborers.

Makes Another Big Shipment
Monday, the Kendrick Creamery
Company mode a 1100 pound ship
ment of butter to the Spokane mar
ket. This is the second large ship
ment this month besides the small
ones made. The factory is making
the right kind of butter and the
buttermaker, Mr. Gibbons, says that
all he wants is more cream and he
will supply the demand. From the
amount of cream coming in this sea
son of the year and taking in con
sideration the cold weather, one can
figure that when spring opens the
quantity should increase and if so
the factory will do a flourishing
business the coming season. Those
who said that a creamery would not
pay in this country has begun
change their minds. It is always
the knocker who has to get kicked
right hard before he wakes up to
the fact that any legitimate business
will make good if properly handled.
Bring in more cream.
Southwick Items
Southwick, Jan. 28.—Southwick
is fast becoming an educational cen
ter. There are now seven districts
and three counties represented in
the high school here. It is doubtful
whether a higher class of young peo
ple could be found in the state than
the student body here. No attempt
is made to teach the sciences which
require a laboratory, because the
school is not equiped for the work.
In history, mathematics, English and
foreign languages, thoroness is in
sisted upon. Accuracy is the watch
word in everything.
A Civil Improvement League was
organized among the high school
students here last Monday. The
following are the names of the mem
bers: Christina Southwick, Goldie
Southwick, Marie McFadden. Sallie
King, Alvira Henderson, Fern Gra
ham, John Helton, Alex Lawerence,
Mayme Kunes, Clara Jenks, Myrtle
Bunger, Viola Thornton, Hazel
Longeteig, Ressie Triplet. Alex
Lawrence was elected president,
Viola McAllister Vice-President, and
Sallie King' secretary. The league
i8 a working organization and it is
hoped that much good will' be ac
complished thru it.
In the district spelling contest
held in Leland Saturday for the pur

Feb. 12. John Longeteig and Clay

partment of the schools here won

resentatives whose names we did

Robbery Sunday Night
Sunday night the Kendrick Fur
niture Company building was enter
ed by some unknown parties. The
furniture stock was not bothered
but the Oldfield Jewelry stock was
lessened by their visit. The same
parties made an effort to enter the
McDowell Pool Hall by way of the
back door. They must have been
frightened away while in the at
tempt of entrance for they had bored
six holes in the pannel.
Since the city council has seen fit
to lessen the expenses of the town
by taking off the night watchman,
things have^been missing in several
places. This makes the second store
that has been entered It would, it
looks like, be a better business pro
position, to hire a man to watch the
places of business and let all pay
part of the expense than to let one
firm at a time be held up to the
tune the night prowler wishes to
make them stand. Then we call the
County officers and that expense has
to be met, ao why not have the
proper protection in the beginning
and stop this kind of work.

In Memory of Mrs.
E. P. Atchison
According to the course of nature,
the price of life must be paid and
last Wednesday evening at 8:36, the
beloved wife of our esteemed citizen
Mr. E. P. Atchison gave up her
career of usefulness and numbered
her spirit with the redeemed of
God. The community of Kendrick
was shocked and compelled to real
ize that the noble life of one of her
best citizens had passed to her re
ward.
It seems terrible to all the friends
and doubly so to her husband and
dear children. We cannot realize
the terror of death until we must
face the price of it. The home, the
church, the community, the lodges,
and all alike feel the loss wo are
called to sustain. A loving wife, a
tender and dear mother, an earnest
Christian, a faithful affiliant to the
Rebekah and the Woodcraft and an
exemplary member of society. Such
were the qualities of our beloved
friend. In all the walks of life her
queenly and stately appearances
were most exemplary. Uncomplain
ing, fully devoted to her home an<t
home life, faithful to every trust
confided to her, were her staunch
qualities.
Her special love for the church
and Sabbath school were most faith
fully exemplified in her attention
to their various needs. The church
building the manse, alike with all
their activities, were stamped by
her life and energy. The Campfire
Girls and Boys Club were her spec
ialties next to her Sabbath school
class. Too much cannot be said con
cerning such a life. She alike waa
a Mary and a Martha, waiting her
Masters bidding and preparing for
the comforts of the needy.
Even with all these qualities in
the very m.dst of a hopeful life, all
must come to a sudden end and at
an early life full of promises. Her
days were cut off and just when
husband and children hoped for the
continuance of the joyful life, its
door is closed and memory ceases.
While the husband was in the f; r
east at the bedside of a stricken sif
ter, the message of severe illness
comes and with a rush he speeds to
the expected bedside of his wife.
But death had preceeded him, and
only preparations for the resting
place was left for him. The obse
quies were brief and impressive.
The tributes of friends and societies
were profused and beautiful. The
class of fourteen boys, sadly and
manfully bore the body to its final
resting place. The home ties brok
en, it now devolves upon the father
to foster alone what mother and
father did united. The sympathies
of the entire community are grac
iously extended to Mr. Atchison and
his little ones. The funeral waa
conducted from the Presbyterian
church Sunday morning at 11 A. M.,
The Rev. Dr. Smith making the ad
dress. The choir and a special
quartet rendered appropriate music.
Interment was made in the Kendrick
cemetery.
Those attending the funeral from
a distance were Mr. and Mrs. W.
Trumble, Dr. Rothwell and daugh
ter, Spokane; Mrs. Medcalf and Mrs.
O. D. Bums, of Lewiston, Mrs.
Wicks, of Gifford, Messrs. E. W\
Eaves, M. B. Mickelson, S. D. White,
of Lewiston, W. Stoddard, Gifford.
Mr. W. E. Atchison, son, received
the word while at his Montana home.

funeral, arriving here Monday.

more marshmellows.
