Recent embargoes imposed by Denmark and Sweden, particularly on exports to Germany, are in
tcrpreted here by a high administra-tion official as meaning that the .Scandinavian countries have entered
upon "a policy of preparation" out of fear that they may be plungedinto the Kuropean war at any time.
This view, which is taken hy other students of Kuropean affairs iti close touch with the trend of
recent developments, is regarded as confirmatory of reports from private sources that Sweden and Denmark
are verging on an outbreak, and that Norway will join them if they go into the conflict. It supports the
belief of lesser ofhcials that the Scandinavian countries realize there is imminent danger of their becom
