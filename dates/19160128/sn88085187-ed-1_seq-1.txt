SAY, BUT PETE
FELL FOR HER
Then Capt. Smith Shattered
Illusions Concerning the
Pretty, Sweet-Faced Girl
Who Drew 25 Days i
By E. A. Peters
Girlishly embarrassed, her eyes
wide ln Innocent wonder, she
stood before Judge Evans ln po
lice court yesterday afternoon.
She wore the same chic satin
dress, short and narrow, that had
been her dancing frock the night
before. Dainty white kid shoes,
together with a coiffeur that set
off the luxuriant beauty of her
oval face In a manner that would
delight an artist, completed the
efect.
She was anywhere roni 16 to
20, and her winsome Innocence
was strikingly in contrast to the
sordid grey ness of the dingy
court room, fouled by its daily
contact with criminals and wom
en of the street,
• • a
"Georgia Ross?" the court de
manded. And the Judge looked
kindly down as the child stared
frankly up at hlin.
"Yes, sir," ln a murmur, as she
half turned to hide her face from
the gaiiing audience of men.
"You are charged with being
drunk and disorderly. Are you
guilty or not guilty?" The judge
seemed astonished as he read
the charge and thou gazed nt the
flower-like prisoner.
"Guilty, sir," In a whisper.
• • •
A big officer stepped forward
to testify. He had been on duty
at a dance the night before. The
girl had attracted his attention
when she staggered out of the
women's cloak room, lie had
thought her 111, and rushed to her
assistance. As he caught her, a
bottle had dropped to the floor
behind her. He smelt liquor on
her breath.
He produced a small catsup
bottle, with a spoonful of dark
liquid in the bottom.
"Whisky, sir; you can smell It
for yourself. And when I tried
to get her out of the dance quiet
ly, she became so abusive that 1
had to send her to jail. She's
the first woman arrested for be
lng drunk this year," he explain
ed.
• • •
"Why, I never even have seen
that bottle before," spoke up the
girl, and the audience, plainly
sympathetic, looked ready to mob
the policeman.
"Where did you get your
liquor?" asked the court. He, too,
seemed sympathetic
"Why, I Just had a glass of
beer before I left home," came
the timid answer.
"Where do you live?"
"I keep house here ln Taco
ma."
"You are married?" The
court's astonishment was Increas
ing.
"Yes, sir."
"Did your husband attend the
dance with you?"
The girl hesitated. It was evi
dent to the entire court room
that she was fabricating her story,
perhaps to shield others
"N-no, sir, he didn't."
"Another nish".'"
"Y-yea."
"What does your husbnnd do?"
Again the girl hesitated, ni
though to find a plausible an
awer.
"He used to be a b-bartender,'*
■he said aoftly.
"Well, under the circumstances,
I have to punish you. But the
entire affair seems strange,"
Judge Evans declared.
"I will not make It a Jail sen
tence, however. Twenty-five dol
lars fine!"
Hesitantly, with head downcast,
tha wisp of a girl In her pretty
party gown, tripped back to her
seat on the prisoners' bench. A
moment later ahe was led by a
matron to hercell In the murky
basement of the city hall.
w• • "
"Georgia Rosa?" replied De
tective Captain D. O. Smith, an
hour later. "You mean the girl
back there—"he point-id towards
the subterranean rows, of cells—
"yea, I know her."
■ "But isn't there some way that
an innocent awest little thing
like her can be removed from thii
vile dungeon that Tacoma call*
a jail?" asked the excited ques
tioner. *
"Innocent —sweet?" replied
tha white-haired detective vagui
ly. "Oh, she pulled that old stuff
on the court, did she?''
"Yes, we know Georgia. Only j
that isn't her name.
"Married? Not that anybody ,
knows of. But she's been living '
with a aaloon porter for the last .
year or so.
"That kid is one of the great
est little actresses you ever saw— '
inside the movies or out. She can
hand out a baby stare that would
melt the meart of a graveyard
monument. And dress — say, |
you'd think she was one of the
'400.'
"Bui Georgia's just 'one of Ihe
bunch,' at that. She plays the
cafes, and there's been many a i
hardened old cafe habitue who!
ha sfullen for her Innocent story
about how her father and mother I
just died and she can't get work,)
and everything looks so blue she j
guesses she'll commit suicide.
"Oh, yes, lots of those fellows
I have shelled out good money In '
the form of loans, because their j
hearts were touched by the baby j
eyes nnd the hard-luck stories.
• * •
"The last time we had he rln
jail was when she was picked up
with $105 in cash on her person,
and she wouldn't tell where she
got all the coin.
"Oh. yes, we all know little
Georgia down here at headquar
ters, all right."

That's What New Commercial Club Amounts to
**v*
THIS iS YEAR OF PROMISE
THE all-but-impossible has been accomplished.
A new Commercial Club with practically 3,000 members has
risen on the ruins of the old organization.
The business interests of the city—yes, and whal is more important
all interest! of the city—have been brought together again, after several
years of division and dissention. .
Professional men, working men, Tacoma men generally, as well as
men engaged in strictly commercial and industrial pursuits, make Up
the new club.
In one sense "club" is a poor term for the purpose. What really
has been created is a new community center, a civic clearing house, a
focus of progress.
The croakers said it could not be done, would not be done. Today
those very croakers stand enrolled as members, and most of them arc
enthusiastic members at that. |
A clique-ruled, close corporation has been replaced by a democracy
in which every member posesses a vote on the nomination of all the
directors representing his bureau, a vote ou the ELECTION OF EV
ERY DIRECTOR in the club and a direct voice in all the acts of the or
ganization.
Thus, Tacoma not only has been brought together, but has been
brought together on the right.sort of a basis, a basis $iat ought to tnke
the city a long ways ahead. «
It now is up to every one of us to "hit that line hard," for
THIS IS THE YEAR OF PROMISE.

May Prescribe DlvMon
A section of this law provides
that whenever railroads or other
■ oniiiioii carriers refuse or neglect !
to establish voluntarily through,,
or joint rates to any point, the
interstate commerce commission i
Is empowered, after a hearing, to
establish such joint rates.
These rules niuy he establish- 1
ed as the maximum to be charged,
and tbe commission Is given the
power to prescribe the division of
such rates under which tha.
through routes may be operated.
Will lie Asked To Do II
All this may be done by the'
commission on its own initiative,'
whether or not a complaint ia
made to It.
The commission has neer ex
ercised this power so far as
through rates to the northwest Is
concerned, says Rejtiolds. It will
be asked to exercise it right now.
The northwest already has
asked the interstate commission
to wipe out the discrimination
and advantages which the south- 1

it.
