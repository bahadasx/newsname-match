S. E. Smith presented tho city of
St. Helens with a Hag that Is worthy
a place In the mllltury archives of tho
United Slates.
The nag lius henn liundud down In
tho Smith family from generations
and It Ih known to ho over 100 years
old. It Ih faded and torn, with bullet
holes and other evidence of war.
It was In tho battle of Hull Hun

Gettysburg.
It was used In tho 100th reglmeut

It measure night by fifteen feet,
with the standard number of strlpcH
and 38 star, representing tho num
ber of states in tho union when the
Hag was mude.
W'hllo It was proKcnted to the city,
it has not yet been formally accepted.
No doubt Muyor Morton will provide
somo function for Its formal accept
ance. It is a valuuble historic emb
lem, valuable beyond dollars, and
deserves a patriotic and public ex
pression of Its real hlHtorlc worth.
It will be placed In the vault of the

safe from fire, and what Is cuul)y

HIGH SCHOOL NOTES.
Tuesday evening one of the fastest
bnsketbnll games of the season was
played in tho Sunset gymnasium, bo
tween the S. H. II. S. and f ranklin
H. S.
Tho scoro was 16 to 18 In favor of
the luttor with only one more minute
to play, when our boys showed up
their "pep" and ran the score up to
19 to 18 In our favor.
Evory member of the team played
a good, fust game throughout. The
lineup for St. Helens was as follows:
forwards, Wellington and Doavers;
guards, Zysett and Laws; center,
Porry; Droits substituted for Deav-
ers In the last part of the last half.
We have a new student enrolled In
our ranks. Wednosday morning
Miss Addlo Adams of Portland, regis
tered in the sophomore class and we
understand will be an addition to our
tennis team noxt spring.
Saturday evening our baseball
toiun meets Rainier on tho hitter's
floor and we hope to scoro a victory
over them In return for the defeat we
met from their hands a short time
ago.
LaBt Monday morning all eyes
wero attracted to the new program
that had beon put on the sideboard
during the week end. Some class.
Notice to all whom It may concern:
All those who aro not good footracers
are advlBod to go around by the
Congregational church when entering
town as the boys aro throwing the
snow away from around tho school
building, Dud there might bo danger
of your , receiving some of this on
your structures, as many know from
exporionco.
Our sub-treshlos aro progressing
very well in their classes and are be
ginning to act like students, already.
WEATHER REPORTS
The twelvo inches of the "beautiful
snow" hav disappeared and mother
earth Is again In evidence.
However, Bnow commenced fall
ing again Monday evening, and on
the following morning the ground
was covered to a depth of five Inches.
The recent cold spell was a record
breaker, that Is to hear the expres
sions of the present time. The
human mind is very unreliable, es
pecially when It comes to the weath
er. "Never saw the like Blnce '88,"
was the universal comment.
Well, you have, too.
No longer ago than four years, a
similar winter was experienced. Jan
uary 7, 1912, there was a foot of
snow and a sheet of sleet on top. Tho
weather was clear and cold. The mill
closed. The next day four additional
inches of snow fell. The snow was
so heavy that the shed over th?
planer broke down with a crash
breaking pipes, setting the sprink
ling business in operation, floodin
that part of the mill. The warmth
of the Bteam inside the mill caused
tons of snow to slide down. The day
following the mercury registered 16
auovo.
We received the above information
from J. Q. Gage, who was employed
at the mill at the time and recorded
the condition of tho weather and
events at the time.

SUNSET VICTORIOUS
The Sunset basketball team
showed its old time superiority last
Saturday evening by annexing an
easy victory over the C. B. B. C. jun
ior alumni, Portland. The final score
ended 45 to 16 in our boys' favor. It
seemed for awhile that the Sunseters
were going to have a real walk away,
but the Portland boys came back
strong in the second half and held
the score about even. It was a much
better game than the score indicates,
as both teams were up and coming
all the time, but the team work of
the home club was bound to triumph.
Had Clifford, the miniature forward
for C. B. B. C. been In form, the
score would have been far different.
A small crowd witnessed the game,
which shows that the Sunset club is
not getting tho support they should.
They will always assure you of a
good game, bo turn out and help
them win. This coming Saturday
night (29th) a game has been sched
uled with the second team from the
Multnomah club of Portland.
REAL WINTER
F. P. Phillips of The Dalles, Bpent
several days in this city during the
past week. While The Dalles Is
only a little over 100 miles up the
Columbia from here, they had real
winter ' weather during the recent
cold spell. Mr. Phillips informs us
that tho mercury registered 17 de
grees bolow zero, and cattle- were
driven across Columbia on the" ice?
AS OTHERS SEE US
The City of Kt. Helens "Plucks the
Grajei"
Once again the little city of St.
Helens on the Columbia river, steps
forth and "plucks the grapes." The
shipyards there are making another
giant five-masted, motor-power
schooner, the building of which will
keep dozens of high-priced mechanics
at work for the next six months.
Already on the ways there sits the
City of Portland, almost a mate of
the ship Just started and perhaps
the largest single deck wooden ship
in the world.
Thus Is St. Helens showing there
is not only a demand for wooden
ships on this coast, but also what
local capital can do when turned to
ward shipbuilding.
A short time ago St. Helens got
an order to bid in five or six ships.
The yards were already full and
word was sent back to the Eastern
firm that at least two of the contracts
would have to be sent to Portland.
St. Helens couldn't handle them all.
The new motor schooner will be
almost 300 feet long, with a beam
of 46 feet and a carrying capacity of
2,000,000 feet of timber, or practi
cally 3500 tons dead weight. For
rapid loading and unloading, the
vessel will have four Bteam winches.
A report from St. Helens declares
that "the shipbuilding company will
have to double Its force of work
men and make all possible haste to
get both vessels out as soon as pos
sible, for the freight rates are very
high now and vessels very scarce and
these two ships are in demand."
Coos Bay lias the facilities for
building good-Bized Ball and steam
schooners, as many good craft that
sail the seas give ample evidence.

A GREAT SHOWING
1915 LUMBER SHIPMENTS
Shipments of Bt. Helens Lumber Co.
100,000,000 Feet
- The year just closed was consider
ed an unfortunate one In the lumber
trade, but the shipments from this
place during the year 1915, makes a
remarkably good showing. The total
output of the two plants la in excess
of 70,000,000 feet and added to this
Is the output of the creosotlng plant
and a piling and tie concern which
brings the total shipments for the
year over 100,000,000 feet board
measure.
The total shipments for the year
were as follows: January, seven ships
lumber, 5,000,000 feet; February,
nine ships, 6,000,000 feet; March,
18 ships, 7,600,000 feet; April, 16
ships, 6,700,000 feet; May, 15 ships.
6,600,000 feet; June, 10 ships, 4,-
000,000 feet; July, 16 ships, 7,000,-
000 feet; Aug., 11 ships, 8,000,000
feet; September, nine ships, 3,800,
000 feet; Oct., 10 ships, 4,500,000
feet; Nov., 10 ships, 4,800,000 feet;
Dec., nine Bhips, 4,600,000 feet.
The greater part of this has been.
shipped to San Francisco and South'
ern California ports for distribution
among the mines of Utah and New
Mexico, but the following shipments
have been made for foreign and At
lantic coast delivery:
For Peru, one cargo, 900,000 feet;
tor Australia, one cargo, 850,000
feet; for London, one cargo, 3,000,
000 feet; for India, one cargo, 3,500,
000 feet; for Mexico, two cargoes,
2,100,000 feet; for Honolulu, two
cargoes, 2,050,000 feet; for New
York, two cargoes, 2,600,000 feet.
With the Increased demand for
lumber, it is expected the production
of 1916 will add greatly to that of
the past year.
As an Interesting fact in regard to
the pay roll of longshoremen in stow
ing the above shipments, it costs from
75c to 81.00 per thousand to load
vessels.
