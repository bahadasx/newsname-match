In Covington and Newport Told of In
Letters from Pastors
Robberies at McKinney and Lancas
ter and a Sure Enough Hajul
w Made at Eubank.
A band of bold, bad burglars
seems to be operating in this section
of the state. Following close upon
the heels of the robbery of G. H.
blasters' store at McKinney last week
the country store of G. H. Floyd, at
Geneva, below McKinney was robbed
and on Wednesday night the McKin
ney Milling Company was entered.
Early Thursday morning burglars
blew the safe at the Lancaster de
pot and entered R. E. McRoberts'
drug store. A sure-enough burglary
-was but over at Eubank when Ed
Inland was robbed of about $8,000.
The Floyd store was robbed on the
same night as the Masters burglary,
and a quantity of groceries and a
small amount of change taken. A
-window was prized open, and en
trance effected through it.
The burglary of the McKinney
Milling Company took place Wed
nesday night. A window in the rear
was jimmied open, and the safe then
opened, but no money was found.
Several sacks of the best flour was
taken, probably seven or eight. Man
ager J. L. McKechnie secured Lair's
bloodhounds from Hustonville. The
dogs made a trail at once, and started
up the road but soon gave it up. It
was evident that the robbers had en
tered a buggy and driven off as the
dogs repeated the same performance
when put on the scent again.
Lancaster Larcenies.
The depot at Lancaster was enter
ed early Thursday morning by the
burglars breaking the glass in the
loor and turning the night latch. The
knob was broken off the safe with a
large railroad wrench, and then the
safe was dynamited. Only a few
stamps were secured, however, A
sack containing about $5 was hidden
in a corner of the room by Agent
Patterson and was not found. The
safe's money box was found on the
Tailroad south of Lancaster next
xnornmg. "The 'McRoberts' drug store
on the public square was entered eitn
er before or after the depot bur
glary, entrance being effected thru
the front door, the glass of which
was also broken. It is said that
nothing of importance was taken
from the drug store, although the
case containing narcotics was visited,
the intruders evidently being after
"dope" of some kind. No clew was
left by any of the burglars.
Sure-Enough Burglary at Eubank.
The robbery of Ed Noland at Eu
bank was the most successful of the
many that have been pulled off in
this section in recent years. Accord
ing to news from there, Mr. Noland
had the check from the Cincinnati
Southern railroad company, which
he was recently awarded in a damage
suit, amounting to about $11,000.
The check was cashed by Mr. No
land's attorneys at Danville and with
the remainder in large bills, amount
ing to about 8,000, Mr. Noland re
turned to his home at Eubank. It
was almost one o'clock before he
reached home. He placed the mo
ney under his pillow and laid his pis
tol on a chair close at hand so as to
he readv for any intruder. The next ,
morning when his family awoke, No
land could not be aroused for a long
time and it was extremely difficult
to awaken him. It was then discov
ered that the window screen had
been cut away and the window left
open and every cent of the money
gone. The police were notified and
an investigation made, but no trace
of the burglars could be found. W.
H. Lair, of Hustonville, was called
to the scene with his bloodhounds,
but no clew could be obtained. It
is thought that the robbers caught
an outgoing freight immediately. No
land thinks that he must have been
chloroformed as he heard absolutely
nothing and was not aware of the loss
of the money until late the next day.
In the stolen roll were some bills of
large denominations fifties and hun
dreds composing the bulk of it.

The Woman's Club of Stanford is
prosecuting a vigorous campaign this
week, in an endeavor to secure suf
ficient financial guarantees to hold a
Chautauqua here this coming sum
mer. A representative of the Alka
hest Chautauqua circuit met here ear
ly this week with the members of the
club and offered them an attractive
proposition, and as is usually the case
the ladies have gone to work with a
vim. The Chautauqua will cost
something like $350 and the ladies
hope to be able to engage enough
tickets to insure that this sum can
be met. Presenting the matter to
the business men of the city, they
secured signatures of about 40 who
guarantee to stand a financial re
sponsibility of up to $10 each in the
event there should be a deficit. Com
mittees are now at work soliciting
ticket sales, and are meeting with
much encouragement.
The Alkahest bureau is said to of
fer a splendid program, among the
speakers being men like William Jen
nings Bryan and Vice President
Thomas S. Marshall. It is proposed
to hold a five or six days' program
here and make the entertainment
worth coming miles to see each day.
There is but one organization in
Stanford that can make a Chautau
qua here a success and that is the
Woman's Club which has the matter
in charge. These ladies have done
and are doing a great work for Stan
ford and deserve every encourage
ment from citizens of the sterner
sex.

Mr. and Mrs. William M. Bright
gave a very delightful dining at
Bright's Inn, their handsome home,
out on the Danville pike, Tuesday,
in honor of their relative, Mr. W. M.
Bright, Sr., of Normal, 111., who was
their guest. Those present were boy
hood friends of Mr. Bright and many
of them were schoolmates in the long
ago. Fifty-nine years ago the gen
tleman who was honored, lived in the
house where the splendid dinner was
enjoyed, but left for the farther
west to make his fame and fortune.
This paper is glad to state that he
has succeeded admirably and that
today Normal has no more substan
tial or better citizen than Mr. Bright.
The dinner, which was a most com
prehensive one and beautifully serv
ed, was partaken of in the old stone
part of the building where the host
had spent many happy hours in his
boyhood, with the friends who sat
about him. Following are those who
were present: Messrs. J. C. Hays,
George S. Carpenter, Arch A. Mc
Roberts, S. H. Baughman, Joseph
Ballou, Robert L. Porter, E. P.
Woods, John W. Rout and George P.
Bright. Those invited and who were
detained on account of illness or oth
erwise were: Judge James P. Bailey,
Messrs. Spears Fisher and J. T. Hack
ley and Dr. J. F. Peyton. Their
seats at the big table were taken by
nephews and grand-nephews of the
guest of honor.
The average age of the gentlemen
present was 74 1.-2 years, which
makes the gathering probably the
oldest that has been together at a
festal board in this section for some
time.

Jesse Dunn, the 12-year-old son
of Mr. and Mrs. Owsley Dunn, north
of town, is in a very serious condition
at the home of his parents, as a re
sult of a fall on the ice, while skat
ing on a pond near his father's home
a week ago from last Tuesday. The
little fellow slipped, and fell, and
the back of his head struck on a ridge
of the ice. He paid little attention
to the accident at the time, although
he was severely shaken up, and play
ed around until the Sunday following
when he began to suffer from a severe
heada'che. Since that time, he has,
at frequent intervals suffered the.
most excruciating agony, and no way
can be found to relieve his suffering
except to put him under the influ
ence pf an opiate. Physicians have J
made ;a thorough examination of the
little fellow and are of the opinion
that some structure of the brain has
been dislocated or broken loose by
the jar received at the base of the
skull when he struck it on the rough
ice' at the time of his fall.. Every
thing that medical science can sug
gest is being done for the child, and
the physicians are hopeful that the
strange injury will work out its own
cure for there seems little that they
can do for him except to relieve his
suffering as much as possible at the
time the spasmodic attacks come up
on him.

Ef h&r:
A lengthy circular letter has been
numerously received here from the
pastors of the Covington churches, of
which Rev. Joseph W. Hagin, former
ly of this city, is one, urging all who
are interested in preserving the Sab
bath to write to the representatives
and senators now at Frankfort to
support the Frost and Greene bills,
which are designed to close up the
Covington and Newport saloons on
Sunday. Conditions in those tow cities
have been shown to be intolerable
ever since former Attorney General
James Garnett startet rne effort to
close up the groggeries there on the
sabbath. Among the things the min
isters say in their appeal are: "Cov
ington and Newport on Sunday: Sa
loons wide open; drunken men and
women; vile and filthy language;
reckless driving; women openly in
sulted; repulsive profanity on the
streets and street cars; city and
county officials utterly fail to enforce
the law; juries fail or refuse to in
dict or convict violators of Sunday
closing law; Circuit Judge and Com
monwealth Attorneys express opin
ion that juries will not act; injunc
tion proceedings fail as a practical
remedy; remedial legislation needed;
the best moral element; of northern
Kentucky asks the state 'Will you
stand for present conditions?' Are
you with us? Tell them so, today."
Reference to this matter was made in
several Lincoln county pulpits Sun
day and the need for active co-operation
of all Christian, law-abiding
people of the state was fully set
forth and undoubtedly will meet with
an immediate response.
BIG FLOCK OF WILD DUCKS.
Sam F. Gentry, who is the best
posted man in this part of the state
on wild fowl and their habits, in
forms the I. J. that he saw this week
one of the largest flocks of ducks he
has ever seen on the acre pond on
Forestus Reid's farm on the Huston
ville pike, about two miles west of
Stanford. They completely covered
the-pond. Speaking'of them Mr. Gen
try said: "These birds are protect
ed by the federal migratory law,
which prohibits hunters from shoot
ing wild fowls in their semi-annual
migrations, and has resulted in an
extraordinary increase of wild wa
ter fowl of the most valuable spe
cies, which includes the Mallards,
Pin-Tail, Butter Ball, Blue Bill, Black
or Dusky Mallard Ducks. Since the
enactment of this federal statute the
U. S. Biological Survey has been con
ducting an extended inquiry as to
its effect. Many reports are to the
effect that the number of water fowls
observed, exceeds anything seen in
the last twenty-five years. Touching
on the aggregate value of the wild
fowls as a national asset, and taking
on a basis, appraisals of Maine and
Oregon, the annual revenue from the
migratory wild fowl are for the two
states, respectively, $656,000. This
would indicate that the actual an
nual returns from this source in the
United States would be hundreds of
millions of dollars. Now if we could
stop local snip hunters from violating
this Migratory Law, we would have
ducks and snips a plenty here."

Eighth District Republicans Decide to
Meet Here February 29. Shel
byville Only Opponent.
The Eighth District Republican
presidential convention will be held
in Stanford, Tuesday, February 29,
at 2:30 o'clock, p. m. This was de
cided upon at a meeting of the Dis
trict Committee held in the county
court room here Thursday afternoon.
Shelbyville was the only contender
against Stanford for the honor of
entertaining the convention. The
vote was eight counties to two in
favor of Stanford. At the meeting
of the convention two delegates and
two alternates will be named to the
national convention at Chicago, an
elector and a member of the State
Central Committee.
The committee meeting here
Thursday was largely attended by
members and representative repub
licans of the district, and all seem
ed to think that the G. O. P. has a
good chance to win this year. Out
side of the friendly contention over
the meeting place, the committee
meeting was entirely harmonious.
Col. Mike Hughes, former postmas
ter at Shelbyville, led the fight for
the convention at Shelbyville, and
had valiant assistance from former
Postmaster Wallace, of Richmond,
and former U. S. Marshal Short, of
Madison county. When tlie vote
came, however, Madison divided her
32 votes evenly between the con
tending cities, giving 16 votes to
Stanford and 16 to Shelbyville.
State Central Committeeman Geo.
D. Florence called the committee
meeting to order, and stated the pur
pose of the meeting. Members of
the Stanford Commercial Club were
present and Messrs. P. M. McRoberts
J. C. McClary, Wm. Severance, S.
M. Saufley and City Attorney T. J.
Hill made short invitation addresses
to the committee.
James Spillman of Mercer county
moved that the Convention be held
in Stanford on February 29th, the
day before . the otate . convontioivfSt
Louisville.' This was seconded by"W.
C. Cundiff, county clerk of Casey. Mr.
Hughes moved to make the place of
meeting Shelbyville and made an ex
tended argument. Committeemen R.
L. Davison, of Lincoln, and Nelson D.
Rodes, of Boyle, called attention to
the fact that Lincoln county had nev
er had a convention of this sort
whereas a number had been held at
Shelbyville. After Messrs. Wallace
and Short had made arguments for
Shelbyville, the vote was taken, re
sulting as follows: for Stanford:
Boyle, Casey, Garrard, Jessamine,
Lincoln, Mercer, Spencer, and half
of Madison; for Shelbyville: Shelby
and half of Madison's vote. The
committee then adjourned.
ONLY FOUR SHAKERS LEFT
