The following resolutions were j1
adopted by the directors of the Union ?!
Chamber of Commerce at a board
meeting Wednesday evening:
"Whereas, a bill has been introduced
in the South Carolina legisla- ~
ture, now in session in Columbia, calling
for a flat passenger rate of two .
cents per mile on all railroads over 50
. . . _ n <
miles in length operated in South | ~
Carolina, and
"Whereas, the enactment of such c
legislation will naturally retard rail- "
road construction and improvement, ?
which is of such vital impbrtance to ..
the general welfare and upbuilding of
the State of South Carolina, and
"Whereas, it is the belief of the directors
of the Union Chamber of e!
Commerce that it is, more desirab'e ?(
to have increased facilities and better
service than a cheaper rate, and K
we do not believe both can be given K
under present conditions:
"Therefore, be it resolved, That the a
Union Chamber of Commerce representing
every phase of business activity
within the county, go on record
as opposing this bill, and request the
delegation from this county to the a]
general assembly to use their influence
against the bill. ?
"Be it further resolved, that a copy
v* of these resolutions be sent to the ^
chairman of the county delegation t(!
from this county."
The resolution was discussed quite
freely and, when put to a vote, was p
carried unanimously. It was thought
that even if the two-cent flat rate,
under favorable conditions, could be \
inaugurated, the time was inoppor- f<
tunc, owing to the fact that last year b<
was particularly hard on railroads as u
weH^as^otW busi^ess^ corporations.

urged to have the bill sidetracked for

"FROM THE SHADOWS."
To our home and hearts there came
on yesterday, Sunday morning, the a
shadow and shock, that has come to n
many homes before, and must inevita- t]
bly come to every home some time. g.
Death claimed our oldest girl, Harriet t|
Sydney Wagnon, in our thoughts and ^
hearts still one of the babies, but in
reality a bud of young womanhood,
i and to us, now especially, seemingly
so full of promise and sweetness, and
the taking, while so swift, must have
been merciful, and so quiet; it was r
like the sigh of some sweet baby. Yet j
the shock coming so suddenly and t
.... i....,,.wi
MWiiLiy, uui iicuiut aic u luiacu aim f
bleeding, but not broken, our hopes q
and plans are shattered, but not c
crushed. We bow in humility to the ^
omnipotence and omiscient of a Fath- f
er too wise to err, and whose heart is c
love and could not be unkind. s
The readjustment, the unreality, r
and the memories that yet cling as \
constant reminders are such that save 1
for the tenderness, prayers and sym- I
pathy of the multitudes of friends, we I
despair. We realize that words are
poor vehicles, yet we feel that we '
can not do less than to say to each
and every friend and loved one, your
every word of sympathy, your num- '
' berless kindnesses, every flower and 1
evergreen has been and will continue 1
to our bleeding hearts, as "drops of '
cold water given in His name." Sure- 1
ly we can not do less than to pray s
for each of you, that in the years 1
and experiences yet to come it shall
be to each of your hearts as "bread 1
upon the waters."
As the beams of the morning sun
banished the darkness and gloom of
the night, pain and death were conquered,
and the little spirit was wafted
on the wings of the morning, and today
shines with a radience that pain
and sin and tears can never dim. We
would not call her back, save to let
her know how we loved her, to try to
be a little more tender and sympathetic
and thoughtful of and for her,
but as she lay a broken flower yesterday
amidst the billows of beauty nad
sweetness that you so tenderly gave
to her , memory and our comfort, we
could not but feel that from a world,
eternal, painless and full of love, she
looked down and rejoiced that all our
hearts were tender, and because she
left us, we are all drawn nearer
heaven, nearer God and nearer home.
Friends, we can never pay you in
time, but we Shall never cease to
pray for each of you, that you may
know in full the meaning of the
Christ, "Inasmuch as ye have done
it unto one of the least of these, ye
have done it unto me."

AGAINST AMENDING
THE CONSTITUTION.
The senate last night killed a joint
resolution to amend the constitution
so as to allow a trustee of a public
school or a high school to hold also
another office of honor and profit at
the same time. The senate made this
the principal topic of discussion at
last night's session, a number of the
senators entering into the debate.
The resolution was to submit to
the people an amendment to the constitution
regarding the holding of
more than one office of profit or honor
at the same time. The resolution
was amended Monday night so as to
make it apply specifically to trustees
of public schools or high schools. Senator
Banks had moved Monday night
to strike out the enacting words and
the motion was renewed last night by
Senator Wightman.
An amendment was offered by Senator
Laney to amend the amendment
by adding, "or trustee of any State
institution of higher learning" and
Senator J. F. Williams offered a
further amendment that "no member
of the general assembly could be
a trustee of a State institution."
The senate by a vote of 22 to 19
refused to strike out the enacting
words, and then the amendments
were put, belli of which were rejected.
Mr. Williams then offered another
amendment that no member of u.v
general assembly could be a trustee
of a State institution except the ex
officio members of such boards, and

FOR UNIFORMITY
IN ROAD BUILDING
The advisability of creating a State
highway commission with a license
an automobiles for its maintenance
wr.s both championed and disapproved
!>n the floor of the house last night
in a debate which on motion was adjourned
until this morning at 11
/clock. The principal object of such
a commission, as outlined in the bill
proposed by the house committee on
roads, bridges and ferries, is to coaperate
with the road authorities of
various counties and to study the
system of public highways and road
construction.
mission that there should bo one body
It was urged in behalf of a comwith
supervisory and advisory powers
aver the large amount of money expended
by the counties of the State
luring the course of a year in road
work, the aggregate being about $1,500,000.
Mr. Belser took up the committee
substitute which provides for a State
highway commission to consist of five
members. The expenses of the commission
and State highway engineer
are to come out of a special license
fee on automobiles, according to
their horsepower rating.
"We want to put expert engineering
advice before all supervisors," said
Mr. Belser, who pointed out that for
road purposes the counties annually
spend an aggregate of $1,500,000. He
maintained that this large expense
should be carefully supervised by one
matt or body fo men. He said that
Sottth Carolina is one of five States
He estimated that the automobile
not having a State highway board.
He estimated that the automobile
fees would aggregate about $90,000
and that the individual fee would
not seriously increase the expense of
operating a car.
Sir. Belser said that indications
point to national aid op highway comeral
aid. He said that supervisors
usally go to little care and no expense
in getting expert engineering
advice r.'nd that as a result much
w<r\ is done uselessly and without
f. y ultimate end in view. He pointed
Cut that the highway commission
would ultimately have a continuous
system of highways throughout the
State. Committee amendments were
proposed looking to the exemption
of out-of-State cars for a period of
60 days and to the owners of new
cars for 10 days to secure the license.
Mr. Carter argued in behalf of the
tax on automobiles for the maintenance
of roads, saying that automobiles
enjoy special privileges on account
of their speed over other road
travel. He said, too, that all automobile
owners he had seen did not
object to the fee.
Mr. Carter, however, was opposed
to the creation of a State highway
commission, claiming: that it was a
needless expense and wasteful disposal
of the fees realized from tnt>
special taxes. He pointed out that
no limitations are placed on the number
or salaries of assistant engineers
or the travelling: expenses. He maintained
that the counties could g:et
more real benefit out of the funds
than out of the commission. Mr. Carter
has a 'bill providing: for a tax on
automobiles.
Mr. Graydon objected on the ground
of additional taxation on certain individuals,
claiming: that such a step
is unconstitutional. He said that
taxes for roads should ho placed on
landholders for they are the ones
who g:ain most by p:ood roads. He
objected to the bill also on account
of creating: new offices.
At 9:40 o'clock debate was adjourned
until 11 o'clock this morning:

LAYMEN'S CONVENTION.
Three thousand men are expected to
meet in Columbia, February 6-9. It
will be a great convention of laymen
of all denominations, met to stodv the
.relation of tlte church to the jvaw conj^tiTO^(throughTO^
t^e .^^rorld.
Support tHe missionary enterprises of
the church?now laymen will meet to
survey the field, to learn just what is
being done, and what ought to be
done. Able speakers will address the
laymen and on themes that are compelling
in their interest and timeliness.
Such addresses are distinctly worth
while and would repay a long trip; but
along with the information and the
appeal there is other benefit?a broader
outlook, quickened interest, stimulus
to more active participation in
the work of the local church as the
source of power. That is worth reflecting
on. The laymen are not undertaking
any ne wthing; they are
just trying to see. It is true, probably,
that most laymen have been
rather half-hearted in their efforts because
they kr.ew but little of the
| work of the church beyond the Sunday
seriuuu miu \u uy t-i mix-i h?kSuch
a convention as that in Columbia
will bring to laymen when they
are most receptive a view of the world
as a religious opportunity. But there
will be much more; for the church
has problems at home and must study
these problems as church liabilities.
Social problems in the congested
cities, a somewhat perplexing subject,
must be solved. But the church must
infuse into all relations the spirit of
the gospel. Laymen are studying as
well as ministers, and a free discussion,
led by men who are in touch
with those things, must prove greasy
beneficial. And the individual?what
should be his attitude? Such questions
will be illumined by intelligent
discurrion.
[ Read the program. It fairly grins
you in its suggestiveness. Our r ligious
opportunity is a big one; but
it consists not so much in getting
more men into the membership of
our churches as it does in developing
the church as an efficient factor >n
the life of a workaday world.

:T YOUNG GIRL
The Spirit of Miss Harriet
Sidney Wagnon Took Its
Flight to the Land Beyond
the Shadows on Last
Sunday Morning at Eight
O'clock.
Union was shocked Sunday morning
when the message was passed
from lip to lip that the death angel
had visited the home of Rev. and Mrs.
L. L. Wagnon and borne to the
Great Beyond their eldest daughter.
Harriet Sidney. Just one week before
she was a perfect specimen of
health radiating happiness everywhere
and her loved ones and friends
were little prepared for the parting
which was to come so soon.
She was 12 years of age and was
affectionate and gentle, possessed of
a bright mind and won her way to the
hearts of young and old alike; she
was faithful to the Sunday school and
cnunri, never missing a service ti 111
her power to attend. Fair of face
and form and beautiful in character
her death has left a deep wound in
the hearts of many people.
The funeral services were held at
Grace Methodist church, of which she
was a member, and conducted by the
pastor, Rev. E. S. .Jones, assisted by
Rev. J. F. Matheson, Rev. G. P. White
and Rev. W. F. Gault. The interment
was in Rosemont and the little
body was laid to rest at sundown beneath
a mound of beautiful flowers
placed by loving hands.
The Children of the Confederacy,
the sixth grade and her Sunday school
class attended in a body and hundreds
of friends gathered to pay their last
tribute to this sweet little girl.
The honorary pall bearers were B.

address, welcomed the "boosters" to
Union, and there was a response by
one of the party. The music and
speech-making was in the yards of the
Southern railway, and while the train
was standing at. the station.
Four or five of the cars were tilled
with excellent exhibits, showing the
mineral and agricultural advantages
of Kansas, or rather of Southeast
Kansas, for there were represented
nine counties of that section of the
State. Various ores and agricultural
products were the most noteworthy
exhibits. A large number of Union
citizens met this special train here
