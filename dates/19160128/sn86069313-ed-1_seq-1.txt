Dispatches via London Indicate tlc
Japanese havo again brought for-
Svard Group Five of the- Japanese
" demands upon China, which the
- " Tnited States has rcgnrded as clos-
Ing tho door of American opportun-
lty In China and threatening China's
" .sovereignty.
London dispatches indicate that
Great nrltaln Is disturbed by tho re
newal of tho demands. In tho mean
time tho United States understood
the demands were nover definitely
nbaudoned, but that Japan merely
postponed their presentations.
Loudon, Jan. 2'C. Tho Japaneso
government has delivered to the
Chinese Minister In Tokio, for trans
mission to ills government a note
embodying given demands which
were included In tho Japaneso pro
gram of last spring, tho Manchester
guardian learns from far Eastern
sources.
Tho guardian expresses the hope
that this news will bo "authorita
tively contradicted" as tho demands
when previously presented were full
of danger to China's Independence
and their genprnl effect would have
been to placo China under the tute
lage of Japan. "It Is tho aim and
hope of British policy" tho news
paper continues, "to see China
strong and Independent doveloplug
peacefully without Interference from
any foreign powers.
"It is a duty wo owe both to our
selves and to China" says tho Guar-
dian finally, "to help her In that dl -
rorMnn nn.l wn bftvo enormous ma -
terlal Interests too, which relnforco
what Is for us tho only right and
Just policy."
On January, 18, 1915, Japan pre
sented to China a list of twenty-one
demands arranged in five groups.
The first group related to tho Shan
tune nrovlnrn nnrt tn the conceding

previously enjoyed by Germany In
Shantung as well as new preroga-
tlves. Group 2, related to South Man -
churla nnd to consesslons there for
leasing property, trading, railroad
operation and construction the ap
pointment of Japanese as political,
financial and military advisers and
other consesslons. This group also
included demands for special rights
to be granted to Japan regarding In--ner
Mongolia. Group 3, referred to
tho Hanyeh-Plng company .Group 4,
known as tho "spocial group" de
mands that China proclaim that hero
after sho would not yield or lease
any coastal torrltory to any power.
Group 5, known as tho "General
group" was tho ono which aroused
most vigorous protests from the
11111680 government. It contained
seven artlclos, the first regarding
tho employment of China, of Japan
so as advisers, the second, tho con
struction ot Japaneso hospitals,
churches and schools In China; third

sixth, .concessions to Japan In tho

The United States government ad-
dressod a note to Japan with regard present difficulties and prevent fu
to the demands made upon China,1 turo disturbances.
querying ln particular with respect
to three points: The selection of
foreign advisers by China the pur
chase of war munitions and the ques
tion of foreign loans. The Jananeso
government replied to tho note on
,Mrek 22.
''Os, May 25, two treaties between
Japn and Chins, together with 13
aetes, were signed ln the Chinese
foreign office, covering it was an-
nounced, tho practical conclusions
reached on the Japanese demands, of
which, however, flvo articles left for
ulterior argumont. It was under
stood at tho tlmo that tho articles
for consideration were those of group
C. The articles In this group wero
originally seven In numbor, but It
was later stated that article threo
had been eliminated and that artl
clo six had been dtsplnced by pledges
that China would undertake no "tall
itary or naval preparations on the
Fuklen coast In the future. It is pos
sible that the seven demands allud

Pat will be one of tho best equip-
jP n Western Kentucky and tho
' service will be much Improved.
The new generator connects wun
tho engine thus eliminating the big
belt drive and two bearings and this
Improvement will save many shut

is built In the engine In such a man
ner that It takes its power directly j
from the shaft ot the engine. This

ery in 45 days and Mr. Barrass
thinks the new machinery can be in-'
stalled In a wcok. The lights will !
be cut off during installation. Tho
lights have been somowhat unsteady

Tho defeat of tho measure fol

the author of the measure, and Sen

of the bill would ben serious blow

After the defeat ot the bill the

Fipnkfort, Ky., Jan. 25. Follow-

In the' senate today a conference ot

was held tonight and Senator Frost
isued a statement in which he at
tacked Governor Stanley and his
motives charging that he had used
the patronage of his office and that
the governor had entered Into a
deal with the Republicans on the re
districting bill to bring about the
defeat of' the prohibition amend
ment. ,
The Frost statement brought a
prompt and ringing retort from Gov
ernor Stanley, who Issued a state
ment declaring the charge as abso
lutely without foundation. Senator
Frost's statement In part follows;
"State wide prohibition was die-
feated today, 14 to 20. The result ,
of this vote is not disappointing,
save the fact that some men elected
from dry districts that we. expected
support from did not support the
measure.
"When I came to Frankfort at
tBo beginning of this session of the
legislature I very early came to the
conclusion that the fight for sub
mitting a constitutional amendment
would result in defeat, because of
tho influences I found at work ln
opposition to such a measure. I found
Governor Stanley was leaving noth
ing Unsaid or undone that would
contribute to the defeat ot this
measure. In this connection I rcal-
lzed what power he had through
public patronage, which was unlim
ited. I am also informed from tho
press and current rumor he agreed
to assist tho Republicans in passing
a Republican redisricting bill to
have influenced some who did not
closely scrutinize It."
Senator Frost ended his state
ment by saying that he would Intro
duce a bill two years hence on state
wide prohibition and see It passed.
