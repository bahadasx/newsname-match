BERLIN SENDS
ANOTHER NOTE
Proposes Plan to Adjust Lusi
tania Controversy,
SETTLEMENT SEEMS LIKELY'
_I
Although the Greatest Secrecy Sur
rounds the Negotiations It Is Said
on Excellent Authority That the Lat
est German Proposal May Prove
Satisfactory.
Washington, Jan. 25.-Germany has
submitted to the United States, 1
through Ambassador von Bernstorff,
another written proposal designed to
bring about a settlement of the con
troversy over the sinking of the steam
ship Lusitania, with a loss of more
than 100 American lives.
There are indications that the docu
irent may bring to a satisfactory ter
mination negotiations which have been
in progress for eight months.
Although the greatest secrecy sur
rounds the negotiations it is said on
excellent authority that Germany
tnally has agreed to eliminate from
the text of the agreement any mention
of the warning issued by the German
embassy the day the Lusitania sailed
On its last trip from New York.
Mention of this warning is under
stood to have been contained in the
last proposal, which was rejected
after President Wilson had consider
ed it.
It is understood also that Germany
has left out her proposed general res
ervation of admission of wrongdoing
on the part of the submarine comman
der, to which the United States ob
jected.
Omits Mention of Warning.
Mention of the warning is believed
to have been most objectionable to
the administration. In effect it was re
garded as conveying the idea that no
American lives would have been lost
had the warning been heeded.
It is also said authoritatively that;
in its latest communication Germany
nwakes some reference to a desire to
sce the United States take action in
regard to the question involving the
freedom of the seas.
Germany reiterates clearly, it is
said, that the torpedoing of the Lusi
tanic was an act of reprisal for the
British blockade of the German coast.
Extreme regret is expressed that
Americans lost their lives in the com
mission of the reprisal and Germany
freely offers reparation in the form of
indemnity.
The attention of the United States
is called to the fact that such forms
of reprisals have been discontinued as
the result of negotiations with this
government and to the fact that broad
assurances for the future have been
given.
The German government is under
stood to be most anxious to settle the
matter in a manner mutually satisfac
tory. It Is said, however, that the pro
posal now before the administration
is considered to be final. Germany is
said to hold that she has gone as fart
as she possibly can honorably to meet
the views of the United States.
DANBURY HATTERS
WILL LOSE HOMES
New York, Jan. 25.; After fighting
through the federal courts for thir
teen years 189 aged Danbury hatters
have reached the point where they
feel there is nothing left to do but
:sacrifice their savings and the homes
in which they had hoped to spend the
few remaining years most of them
have to live.
Within the next two months homes
and savings will he seized to satisfy
the $252,000 judgment standing
against them in the celebrated Dan
bury hatters' case.
Mart D. Lawler, one of the original
defendants, now living in New York,
told of the discouragement of the
aged union men. The order of sale
of their homes has been approved by

The Danbury hatters were sued for
damages, the result of a strike, which
was declared restraint of trade.
FILM COMBINE IS ENJOINED

Agreements.
Philadelphia, Jan. 25.-An injunc
tion restraining the Moving Picture
Patents company from enforcing al
leged unlawful agreements entered
into by its various associations was
issued by Judge Dickinson in the
United States district court. His de
cree is in conformity with the court's
decision last October, in which it held
that the patents company was operat
ing in violation of the Sherman anti
trust law.
Eleven Die of Measles.
Toledo, 0., Jan. 25.-One thousand
cases of measles, with eleven deaths

tBETTER THAN IN YEAR 1914
Anaconda Business Men's Association
Re-Elects Old Officers.
Al the yearly meeting of the Ana
conda Business Men's association the
report of Secretary F. W. Harrison
paid special attention to the increased
business in that city over the year
1914, and especially to the compilation
of figures and percentages made by
the secretary during the year at the
request of the Associated Advertising
Clubs of the world. These figures
show the following percentages of in
crease over the year 191.4 in the fol
lowing departments of business:
Sales, 48 per cent; accounts, 75 per
cent; stock, 17 per cent; advertising,
5 per cent.
The old officers were re-elected, as
follows:
D. R. MacRae, president; Sig Good
friend, vice president; F. W. Harrison,
secretary-treasurer. The trustees are
J. C. Keppler, C. H. Fuller, Frank Mul
ler, J. H. Strain, J. J. Schwartz and
Ed Heagy.
OIL AND GAS RIGHTS
ARE SAFEGUARDED
Secretary Lane has announced the
creation by President Wilson of three
new oil withdrawals in Montana and
- North Dakota.
The two Montana orders, one cover
ing several rock structures in the
south central part of the state be
ii lieved to be favorable for oil and gas
deposits, and the other cove:ing the
- Glendive rock structure in the east
ern part of the state, total about 498,=
000 acres.
The North Dakota order, which cov
ers the southern end of the Glendive
rock structure, covers about 85,000
acres.
l The department says that, although
these seem large, it should be noted
that the total of 583,000 acres less
than 20 per cent is vacant govern
ment land, the remainder being pat
ented or included in existing entries.
Even the 107,000 acres of vacant land
is subject to homestead, or other non
mineral filing, oil and gas rights being
reserved to the United States.
Thus these orders will not hinder
agricultural development and they may
retain valuable deposits of oil and
gas in the ownership of the United
States.
Exposure Causes Death.
Pat Fleming died at Plentywood
from exposure in going two miles to a
ranch.
AMERICAN RELIEF IN EGYPT

in Caring for Homeless.
Washington, Jan. 23.-Authority for
formation of a committee of Ameri
cans to handle war relief work has
been cabled to Cairo, Egypt, by the
American Red Cross, through the
state department. The immediate task
of the committee will be to aid in car
ing for 4,000 homeless Armenians,
who are being sheltered at Port Said.
A report received from Cairo says
the needs of the Armenians are vari
ous and urgent. They fled to Egypt
last September, most of them com
ing from Antioch, and have been
housed in an improvised tent village.
Bread for them alone is costing $1,000
a month.

SEVERE WEATHER
ALL OVER STATE
While we of the Flathead have ex
perienced real winter weather for the
the greater part of this month, still
there has been no danger of a famine
on food or fuel, nor a single case of
extreme suffering from the cold waves.
This cannot be said of all parts of the
state. A number of deaths are re
portec by the press in the eastern part
of the state and one man, and possibly
two, are thought to have perished near
Lincoln, in the upper Blackfoot coun
try. Coal famines are reported at
Big Sandy, Outlook, Daleview and
other towns along the Great Northern
and Soo lines in the northern and east
ern part of the state. In Sheridan and
Valley counties some points are prac
tically without food or fuel and the
Montana railroad commission has been
appealed to for assistance in securing
prompt shipments of these necessities.
Cattle and sheepmen on the east side
are very dubious as to whether there
will be any herds and flocks left. The
snow is now three feet deep and many
sheep are practically buried it the open
plains. Where hay can be secured it
is being fed, but it is found hard to get
the stock through the deep snow to
where the feed is. Stockmen, old
timers on the range, say it is the worst
winter since 1886, and say this is even
worse than that one.
Would Organize Regiment
A letter from Lawrence R. Kelly,
acting commandant, of Bitter Root,
calls attention to the fact that an effort
is being made to organize the Second
regiment of infantry, Montana Na
tional Guard. He wants to communi
cate with someone who will interest
themselves in this matter and secure
the signatures to the proper petition.
He says:
"The object of the regiment is to
bring the men of the state into closer
harmony, and to stimulate a greater
patriotic spirit for the love of )Toth
nation and state. In no sense is it de
signed to antagonize civic or other mil
itary orders now oper ting within our
limits. Nor has it the purpose of in
terfering in any way with whatever
plans the present congress may adopt
to increase the standing army. The
function of the regiment also will be
to develop better men for the nation
physically, intellectually and morally,
Many towns will be asked to cooperate
in the general plan."

NEWS IN MONTANA
Nine persons, among those arrested
at Butte on charges of violating the
anti-racehorse gambling laws, were ar
raigned in the district court. Stephen,
G. Brown, Butte manager for the Pos
tal Telegraph company, who is alleged
to have secured the information re
garding the races on which the wagers
were laid, is charged with thirteen of
fenses. His bond was fixed at $5,000.
The county attorney's office is still en
gaged in drawing up information
against others of the persons arrested.
Officials state that these arrests are
the beginning of a campaign that will
surely wipe out all forms of gambling
in Butte.
Informations filed in the district
court by County Attorney Matt Can
ning resulted in the arrest of thirteen
I Butte men on gambling charges, Sher
iff Charles Henderson and a force of
twenty-five deputies raiding a series
of alleged bookmaking establishments.
Stephen G. Brown, Butte manager of
the Postal Telegraph company, and
Robert Dunlop, an official of the West
ern Union Telegraph company, were
among those arrested. Miss Ida
Thorne, a public stenographer, also
was taken into custody, but later re
leased on her own rhcognizance.
Two city detectives, Frank White
and H. Van Orden, were found in the
Fischer saloon when it was raided and
County Attorney Canning declared
that informations would be filed in the
district court charging them with fail
ing and neglecting to perform their
official duties.
The officials of the two telegraph
companies are charged with transmit
ing messages for the use of the book
makers. Two of the others under ar
rest are William Fischer and John
Theis, well known proprietors of sa
loons, charged directly with making
books.
The act under which the arrests
were made was passed at the last leg
islative session, abolishing racetrack
gambling in Montana.
Thirteen informations have been
filed against the manager of the l'os
tal Telegraph company and one
against the Western Union. Bond for
$5,000 was required before the court
would release Manager Brown of the
Postal, this sun being a reduciion
from $15,000 first demanded.
NORTH MONTANA TO
PLANT MORE WHEAT
Northern Montana will have a much
larger wheat acreage in 1916 than was
harvested in 1915 or any previous
year, according to James Griffin,
rancher and merchant of Chinook, who
is secretary of the Montana State
Grange society.
"About 75 per cent as much winter
wheat was sown last fall as was sown
in the fall of 1914," said Mr. Griffin,
"but the farmers have been laying
their plans for a great spring wheat
crop. For instance, one man who had
never sowed more than twenty acres
has let a contract for ten acres of
early breaking to be sowed to spring
wheat. That may not be exactly
typical, but it gives a hint of the
trend.
"The acreage of spring wheat will
be fully 50 per cent greater than any
past year, the acreage of 1915 being
the largest so far. Our north country
farmers have been sowing about three
acres of spring wheat to one of winter
wheat, so, according to my figures,
the total acreage sown to wheat in our
section for harvosiing in 191( will be
approximiately 33 to 40 per cent more
than in any previous year."
COAL FOUND ON ROCK CREEK
Many FilIngs Made by Great Falls and
Bozeman Men.
Considerable excitement prevails in
the Rock Creek basin, in the Big Belt
mountains, a few miles northeast of
Nelson, over the discovery of coal, and
great things are in prospect if the
rumors are even half true.
The discovery of the coal was
known to a few men, who kept the
knowledge secret until the plat of
township 13, range 1 east, was filed
and opened for entry Jan. 6 of this
year. Immediately after the plat was
filed a syndicate of Great Falls and
Bozeman men filed declaratory state
nents, covering considerable acreage
in the township. Part of the land
filed upon lies on the North Fork of
Rock creek.
The Helena land office is one of the
busiest land offices in Montana, con
sidering the fact that it is also the
oldest. Last year was the busiest it
has experienced in years and addition
al clerks were needed to transact the
business.
Not even during the cold weather
ha.s there been any abatement. Day
after day filings have been made,
chiefly of homesteads.

NEW COMMISSIONER
NAMED FOR RONAN
After being minus a U. S. commis
sioner since December 7th, another was
named by Judge Bourquin of the fed
eral court last week Wednesday, John
N. Bailey of Ronan, being the man.
He received his commission last Mon
day and is now qualified and ready to
attend to any business connected with
that position.
The absence of a commissioner in
Ronan has been a serious detriment and
inconvenience to the homesteaders and
others in this part of the valley having
land business to transact and Mr.
Bailey's appointment will be welcomed
by all. He drew his first case Tuesday
when Officers Glenn and Ramsey
brought Albert Rhoeder before him on
a charge of introducing liquor on the
reservation. After an examination
the defendant was bound over to the
federal grand jury and his bond fixed
at $250, in default of which he was
taken to Missoula for safe keeping'
Rhoeder was caught at the dance at
Jim Griuder's Monday night with a
little less than a pint of whiskey in his
possession.

GARRISON FAILS TO RESIST
Official Statement Says Disarming of
Montenegrins Has Been Carried On
Up to the Present Without Friction

Berlin, Jan. 25.--Scutari has been
occupied by the Austro-Hungarian
troops, according to an announcement
issued by the Austro-Hungarian head
quarters.
Several thousand Serbians, who
formed the garrison, retired toward

The disarming of the country, says
the announcement, has been carried

At several places the Montenegrins
have not even waited until the Aus

down their arms before the arrival of
the troops in order to return to their

COMMONS MAY VISIT FRONT
Under Secretary Tennant Promises to
Consider Proposal.
London, Jan. 25.-Harold J. Ten
nant, parliamentary under secretary
for war, announced in the house of
Commons that in the past four weeks
thirteen British aeroplanes were lost
on the western front and nine or ten
Gernrgo machines brought to the
ground.
The proposal was made in the house
of commons that all the members of
the house should visit the front dur
ing the parliamentary recess and that
arrangements should be made for
their reception by the commander-in
chief.
Mr. Tennant, on replying to the sug
gestion, while not altogether autago
ristic, thought it would prove too big
an undertaking and entailing too
much work for the general staff, but
he promised to see what could be
done.
SEES GRAVE INJURY F
TO AMERICAN TRADE
Washington, Jan. 25.--reat Brit
ain's "trading with the enemy" act
is vigorously opposed by the United
States in representations prepared for
iresentation to the British foreign of
fice. They are expected to go for
ward inimedlately.
The state department considers that
grave and unjustifiable injury to
American commerce may follow should
an attempt be made to enforce pro
visions affecting business in this coun
t ry.
The "trading with the enemy" act
prohibits persons resident in Great
Britain from trading with any corpo
rr.tions or individuals which are en
gaged in supplying the Teutonic allies
or have business dealings with them.
SECRECY IS NOT POSSIBLE
American Diplomatic Code Known to
Belligerent Nations.
Berlin, Jan. 25.-The supposedly 'se
cret diplomatic codes of the United
States government are known to prac
tically every belligerent in Europe.
Colonel E. M. House, who is con
ferring with United States ambassa
dors in Europe as the confidential
agent of President Wilson, will have
this fact impressed upon him before
he returns to Washington. Through
him the state department will be asked
to change its cipher.
It is now impossible for any diplo
matic agent of the United States in
Europe to cable a message to Wash
ington with the certainty that it will
be transmitted without its contents
being known in Europe. In some in
stances officials of more than one bel.
ligerent country can know the con
tents of such a message before it
r-aches Washington.
