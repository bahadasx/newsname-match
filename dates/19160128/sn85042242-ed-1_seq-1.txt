the Marplot" Is His
Warning.
IN FIGHTING MOOD
URGES PREPAREDNESS
Tells Why He Abandoned Paci­
fists for the Defense
Faction.
New York, Jan. 27—President Wil­
son toniglit opened his personal ap­
peal to the country for national de­
fense. He gave warning that plans
for the readjustment' of the army
•must be formulated and carried out
wtihout delay, aud declared solemnly
he could not predict that the outlook
for the United 'States would lie as
bright tomorrow as today.
Speaking at banquets of tho Hail
way iBusiness association and the
Motion Picture Board of Trade, he
sounded the keynote of addresses he
will deliver in the next ten days in
the middle west.
Mr. Wilson was in a fighting mood
throughout his address. In a speech
delivered early iti the day he declared
he always accepted an j#Vitation to
light.
Honor Before Peace.
Tonight he told the railway men
lie was an advocate of peace, and
had struggled to keep the United
States at peace, 'but he considered
the liberty and honor of the nation
even more important than peace.
This For 'Bryan.
"Woe to any man who plays mar­
plot or who seeks to make party poli­
tics or personal ambition take prece­
dence over candor, honor and unsel­
fish and unpartisan service,,' the
president declared, in speaking of his
defense plans before the railway men.
Wants Action.
He declared the country expects
action and that this is a year.fttac
counting,' aM'the Accounting must be
definite on the part of the parties and
on the part of every individual who
wishes to enjoy public confidence.
"For my part, I hope every man in
public life will get what's coming to
him," ,Mr. Wilson said, amid laughter
and applause.
Gets Warm Greeting.
The president at both banquets
and during his day's visit to 'New
York was greeted with enthusiasm.
Thousands of persons packed the
streets and cheered him as he went
by.
During his speech, before nearly
lf00 business men at the railway ban­
quet, he was frequently interrupted
by applause.
Changes His 'Mind.
The president admitted that in a
measure to the last congress he had
said the need for preparedness was
not pressing. He declared he had
learned differently in the meantime.
'Hie cited his recent support of a
tariff commission as another instance
of a change on his part, but said that
previously there was no need for such
a commission. The business men en­
thusiastically 'cheered him.
iMr. Wilson spoke of men of high
character who were opposing the pre­
paredness issue. He said they were
provincial and that the United States
no longer could cut itself off from the
rest of the world.
Mexican Policy.
The president discussed his Mexi
can policy vigorously. He asserted to

ARMENIAN LEADER
SAYS 150,000 WERE
KILLED OR DEPORTED
London, Jan. 27.—Murad of Sivas,
Armenian leader of the Province of
Sivas, Asia Minor, in an interview
just' received here from Tiflis, gives
an account of the treatment by the
Turks of the Armeniao population in
Asia Minor, in which are many new
details. His story, which is made pub­
lic by Viscount Bryce, who vouches
for the reliability of the source, is in
substa'nee as follows:
"Out of 160,000 Armenians inhabit­
ing the province of Sivas, there re­
mained when Murad left some 10,M)0
who had been spared as useful arti­
sans, or because they were old. The
remaining people, Murad declared,
were either massacred directly or de­
ported to the area between the Euph­
rates river and around Messopotamia.
For disarming the Armenians the
Turks employed various methods of
torture. In Khourakhon, he declares,
one man was actually shod like a
horse and another killed by putting a
red hot iron crown on his head."
London, Jan. 27.—At Habesh, 3,800
Armenians were put to the pole ax,
he asserts. At Herag, the
killed and the young wo
carried away, while €00 children
detained by the Valli, Murad

Interference With All American
Pouches to Neutral Nations
by England Must Stop.
Washington, Jan. 27.—The text of
the American protest' to Great Britain
against interference with neutral
mails made public tonight reveals
that diplomatic and consular pouches
have been treated in a manner the
United States considers "vexaciously
inquisatorial."
The note describes the practices of
British officials as "unwarranted in­
terferences" yid requests a prompt
reply, pointing out that "a strong
feeling is being aroused in this coun­
try by the loss of valuable letters
while foreign banks are refusing to
cash American drafts because •hey
have no assurance that drafts are se­
cure in the mail."
The United States declares that
parcels post articles are entitled to
the exemptions of neutral trade, and
denies the right of Great Britain to
take neutral mail ships into British
jurisdiction for purposes of search
and then submit them to local censor­
ship regulations.
It also denies that the British gov­
ernment' has any authority over neu­
tral field sealed mail on vessels which
merely touch at British port.
With the text of the American
note was made public Great Britain's
ad interim reply, saying that ques­
tions of principle raised by the Unit­
ed States have made it necessary for
Great Britain to consult her allies be­
fore answering finally and indicating
that there will be no unnecessary de­
lay in the negotiations.

CAFTUREDSOLDIERS
United States Army Officer Who
Led Dash Over Line May
Suffer.
Washington, Jan. 27.—There was
no indication tonight that the United
States government would consider
any action necessary in tfie case of
the two American soldiers captured
yesterday by lMexica,ns near .Browns­
ville, Texas, and returned unarmed to
their commands today, other than to
investigate the incident and probably
courtmartial Lieutenants Peyton,
Mort and Waldron, the officers who
led the detachment of soldiers into
Mexican territory to rescue their cap­
tured comrades.
Secretary Garrison said positive or
ders had been given every officer in
the army not to cross the 'boundary
under any provocation, without speci­
fic instructions from Washington.
Should the investigation ordered 'by
Major General Funston prove that the
officers violated this order, it was
said they undoubtedly would be court
martialed and proba/bly would be held
responsible for the death of the four
soldiers, members of the rescue party,
who were drowned in the Rio Grande
while returning from their expedition.
The prompt action taken by Car
ranza military authorities in return­
ing the two soldiers was regarded by
the state department officials as in­
dicative of their desire to prove their
innocense and to display their good
will toward this country.
REIMBURSEMENT
FOR INDIAN PATIENTS
W. E. Paulson, county auditoi of
Benson county, who was in the capi­
tal city this week attending the meet­
ing of the County Auditors' associa­
tion and the State Equalization board,
stated while here that Benson county
will attempt to collect from the fed­
eral government for the care of In­
dian patients at the state hospital for
the insane at Jamestown.
The Old Fort Totten Indian reser­
vation was in Benson county, and the
county in consequence has a number
of Indian residents. Their lands are
exempt from taxation, but when one
goes insane they have to be cared
for at the state hospital at county- ex­
pense.
Mr. Paulson will leave for Washing­
ton in a short time to put the matter
before the Federal Bureau of Indian
Affairs. The result will be anxiously
tMfeited by a number of other coun­
ties in the state which have the same

Gen. Wood Says United States
Like Ship at Sea Threatened
by Typhoon.
RESERVES OF TWO
MILLIONS ARE URGED
Classes Our Navy as Fourth in
in World in Fighting
Efficiency.
Washington, Jan. 27.—The position
of the United States in a war-torn
world was described to die house mil­
itary committee today by Major (ien
eral Wood as like that of a "ship at
sea with typhoon signals coming from
many directions."
"We are living in an era of war,"
he said, "and gradually are accumu­
lating most of the troubles of the
world."
General Wood, who appeared at the
committee's hearing on the army in­
crease bills repeated in the main the
testimony he previously had given
before the senate military committee.
He said it would take an army of a
million and a half to hold a line from
Boston south.
Should conditions at the close of
the war in Europe invite attack, he
declared, the more powerful of the
belligerents could land 500,000 men
on American soil in less than thirty
days.
Army of 220,000.
A regular anny 220,000 fully
trained and always under arms, with
at least 2,000,00 reserves behind them
should be provided, he urged, to meet
the .situation.
The United States navy he classed
fourth in fighting efficiency, and
declared it could not maintain con­
trol of the seas or defend the coast.
Rear Admiral R. S. Griffin, chief
engineer of the navy, told the house
naval committee, considering navy in­
creases, of the mechanical ills to
which submarines are heir, and of
the problems of linding suitable en­
gines for battleships and destroyers.
Admiral Griffin said he believed no
foreign power was outstripping the
United States in naval designs, and
type for type, American craft was as
efficient as any afloat.
Tells of Affection for Rev. Samuel
A. McDougall of
Canada.
Providence, R. 1., Jan. 27.—The
first serious hrfak in the marital re­
lations of die late Dr. ('. Franklin
Mohr and his wife, Elizabeth P. Mohr,
who is charged with having hired two
negroes to kill him, occurred at the
time she told her husband of lier
friendship for a man named Samuel
A. McDougall, who now is a minister
in Pictou, N. S.
This statement was elicited frcm
Mrs. Mohr during a severe cross-ex­
amination this afternoon by Attorney
General Rice.
Step by step the prosecuting at­
torney brought' the details of Mrs.
Mohr's life. Occasionally she ap­
peared confused as to dates and facts
given in her direct testimony and sev­
eral times broke down and sobbed
It was in 1012 she said that she
first told Dr. Mohr about McDougall.
The doctor, she admitted, was in­
censed aud went to Nova Scotia to
try to have the minister unfrocked.
She denied that she told the doctor
that' she had left Providence to go
to Boston because of notoriety caus­
ed by her friendship with McDougall.
She could not keep company with Mc­
Dougall, she said, because the differ­
ences in their religious belief made
it impossible for her to become a
ministers wife.

test clause will be included in the

United States.
MAY FORCE VOTE
ON ISSUE SOON
Washington, Jan. 27.—An outburst
of denunciation against shipments of
American made war munitions to
European belligerents stirred the
senate today, reflecting a revival of
sentiment which may force a vote
upon embargo resolutions which have
been pending in committee for sever­
al months. A dozen senators, includ­
ing Democrats and Republicans, as­
sailed the munition traffic, while
those who have sided with die admin­
istration in its stand that an embargo
would violate international law for
the most part were silent.
Debate Averted.
A petition for an embargo bearing
more than a million signatures pre­
cipitated die debate. A test vote at
one dine seemed inevitable, but it
v/as averted alter much parliamentry
maneuvering by reference of the ].eti
tion to the foreign relations commit­
tee. Senator Kenyon, Republican,
started the discussion in presenting
the petition, which had been sent to
die senate by the Organization of
American Women for Strict Neutral­
ity. The Iowa senator characterized
the sale of munitions abroad as a
"cold blooded money making propo­
sition," and denounced as "rank hy­
pocrisy" the policy of praying for
peace on Sundays and selling weap­
ons of war on week- days. An em­
bargo was urged also by Senators
Clapp and La Follette.
ENGLAND MUST
E
REVIVAL FIRS!
Liverpool, Jn. 27.—Vice Admiral
Sir Edward Beatty, commander of
the First British battle cruiser squad­
ron, whose ships defeated the Ger­
mans in the North Sea, has made a
stirring appeal for a great religious
revival in England as a necessary
step to victory in the war. In a let­
ter read at the annual convention of
the Society for the Propagation of
Christian knowledge, he writes:
"Surely Almighty God does not in­
tend this war to be just a hideous
fracas, or a blood drunken orgy.
There must be a purpose in it Im­
provement must come out of it.
"In what direction? France already
has shown us the way, and has risen
out of her ruined cities with a re­
vival of religion that is wonderful.
Russian has been welded into a whole
and religion plays a great part. Eng­
land still remains to "be taken out ot
the stupor of self satisfaction and
complacency into which her flourish­
ing condition has steeped her. Until
she can be stirred out of this condi*
tion, until a religious revival takes
place, just so long will the war con­
tinue.
"When England can look on the
future with humbler eyes and a pray­
er on her lips, then we can begin to
count the days toward the end."
