jjistrict, wnicn mei in u mi iuub
day nftcrnoon 'at tho Atwood Hotol,

Tho Third Congressional District

lowing oloven counties: McCurtaln,
LeFloro, Latimer, Pushmataha, Choc
taw, Bryan, Atoka, Pittsburg, Mar
shall, Love, and Cartor.
Each of thoso counties has ono

thoso woro In attondanco at tho moot
ing Tuesday aftornoon. Charley von
Wells, of Ardmoro, chairman, called
tho meeting to order. Tho commit
tee designated a total of 164 dole-
gates to attend tho Convention to bo
held April 4th.
This, with tho selection of Durant
as tho place to h61d tho Convention,
and setting tho dato for April 4th,
was tho important business attended
to at tho meeting.
Perfect harmony prevailed In the
gathering, and It is said that Durant
was tho unanimous choice as tho sito
for the Convention. Local Republi
cans and tho 25-Expanolon Club did
some hard work In securing tho big
meet of tho State's representatives of
the G. 0. P., and certainly appreciate
the honor given the city at tho hands
of tho committee.
Tho Convention will be a big thing
for Durant, and tho 25-Expanslon
Club has promised to make all tho
arrangements for It, and to enter
tain tho delegates and visitors quite
Toyally.
The Convention to bo held here on
the dato named will meet for tho pur
pose of. selecting delegates and al
ternates to tho Republican National
Convention which meets In Chicago
on tho 7th of Juno. Besides tho 164
delegates from this district, five or
six hundred other prominent Repub
licans from Over tho State and from
all over tho country will bo here.
Tho Convention will bo ono of tho
biggest things held In Durant for
some time, and tho 25-Expanslon
Club will secure the necessary build
ing, furnish the seats, decorate the
. building, furnish a band, and do ev
erything In Its power to show the
visitors that they are heartily wel
come to all tho comforts and joys
that tho city has to afford.
It Is expected that the Republican
aspirants for tho Presidency will
have mon here to watch tho proceed
ings of tho meeting, and all the largo
newspapers of tho country will send
men here. This is mentioned that
the public may have an Idea of the
magnitude of the gathering, and thus
the better appreciate tho advantages
to accruo from having secured It.
Tho holding of tho Convention In
Durant will aso glvo our citizens an
opportunity to see how a political
convention works, and this will prove
both Interesting and Instructive.
Among the out of tho county Re
publicans who woro here at tho meet
Ing Tuesday may be mentioned the
following: Matthews, Shenberg'er,
and Jeffries, McAlester; Hunt, Po
teau; Hackett, Antlers; Richards,
Boswoll; Davis, Hugo; von Wells,
Ardmoro; Canndy, Madlll; and Jones
of Atoka. Besides those, there woro
a large numborof promlnont Bryan
County Republicans In attendance.
r. S. STEEL EARNINGS
LARGEST IN mSTORY
United States Steel Corporation's
common shares havo been restored
to tholr regular dividend status of 5
per cent. This wao done at tho time
the directors declared a quarterly
dlsbursomont of 14 por cent out of
tho earnings for tho last quarter of
1915. Total earnings of $51,232,788
for the three months were the lar
gest for any similar ported In tho his
tory of tho corporation. Tho corpor
ation's financial condition may bo
judged from tho fact that It now has
cash In banks amounting to $105,
000.000, w.hllo its surplus for tho last
quarter of 1015 amounts to more
than $25,000,000, aa against a deficit
of $5,606,000 In tho corresponding
quarter of tho previous year. Total
earnings for 1915 woro $130,351.
296, comparod with $81,746,518 In
1914. On tho basis of roturns for tho
last quarter of 1915 and with orders
already in hand It Is believed tho cor
poration's earnlngo In 1916 will run
Into unprecedented figures. This
fact is very Important, for tho reason
that the steel business is taken as a
fairly good Indox to tho prosperity
of tho country.

Involved runs Into many thousands
of dollars.
BRYAN CO. OIL
Sample of Good Gmdo of Crude Is
Shown Hero Taken From n Wellon
Houston Place, Near Aylesworth.
Thero Is on display at tho News
office this week a sample bottlo of
crude oil actually produced In Bryan
County, tho sample being brought in
by J. R. Houston from his place two
miles north of Aylesworth In this
county? Tho oil Is of good quality
and is believed to exist in largo poois
muter all that section of tho county.
Two years ago, while John Chil
dress owned the place, four hundred
acres of it some people came in anu
took an oil and gas lease on his land
and other adjoining land, and otarted
a well. At a depth of 250 feet they
found a considerable quantity of oil
and put In casing that far; but for
some reason their machlnory was
unequal to tho task of drilling
further, owing to seme peculiarity of
the sand, and tho well was left at
that point In Its development. Tho
well now stands within a few feet of
tho top .plumb -full of oil and wator,
the oil standing to a depth of sev
eral feet on top of the water. Peo
ple of tho community have boen dip
ping out tho oil and using It for one
purpose and another, and J. R. Hous
ton, of this city, who recently bought
the plaec, Is making an effort to get
the lease holders to finish tho well

Chairman C. C. Hatchctt Says Ho
Could Not Keep Ills Sclf-Rospcct
and Keep on Job, In View of Coun
cil's Action Toward Commission.
Tho long and short of the whole
business Is that the City Council, afr
ter prevailing upon three of tho city's
leading business mon to serve as a
water commission without pay or
without thanks; did not apprecclatq
tho patriotic sorvico rendered, and
mado no bones about showing their
lack of It and tho commission quit,
as many people believe it should havo
done.
Tho resignations filed several days
ago woro considered by tho Council
Tuesday night and accepted, and tho
city has no water commission nor
any other supervision of Its water do-1
partment save what tho Council pro
vldes at Its infrequent meetings.
Tho lotters of Messrs. C. C. Hat
chett, G. B. Malono, and S. W. Stone,
which follow, are self-explanatory:
"Hon James Yarbrough, Mayor,
"City,
"Dear Sir :
"I have no desire to be "sounding
brass or a tinkling cymbal," and
therefore I resign as a metnber of
the Water Commission.
"I believe that the Commission has
materially assisted the city govern
ment in the management of the wat
er department, and I believe that In
tho future the Commission could bo
of still greater assistance. However,
in view of the action of the Council
In the matter of the selection of a
bookkeeper for the Department, I
cannot 'keep my self-respect and re
main a member of the Commission.
The man wo recommended for the po
sition was thoroughly competent and
was a man of good character. Tho
man you selected for the position
perhaps Is equally as good a man
and equally as competent.
"The Commission certainly ought
to be permitted to select a bookkeep
er for the Department. With the at
tltudo of the Council as It is, I do
!not ueieve that there Is any use in
continuing the services of tho Com
missjon for the reason that lta rec-
ommendatlons and actions aro not
needed. The Council deems Itself of
suffinient wisdom to look after these
matters.
"Yours truly,
"C. C. HATCHETT.'
"To tho Honorable Mayor and City
Council,
"Durant, Oklahoma,
"Gentlemen :
"We, the undersigned, hereby ten
der to you our resignations as your
Water Commissioners, to take effect
at once, Vory truly yours,

GERMAN EXPORT TRADE
CONDUCTED BY MAIL
The report comes from London
that the recently Inaugurated censor
ship by the British government of
first-class mails to aad from Ger
many has resulted In the discovery
that Germany has been maintaining
a considerable export trade with the
neutrals in such articles as jewelry,
chemicals, laces, pictures and toys.

whlch have been seized. It was also
said that a large quantity of contra
band, destined for Germany by way
of Scandinavia, and sent from neu
tral countries, has been apprehend
ed. Theso goods Include rubber from
tho Dutch Indies and wool and rub
ber from South America. These aro
said to havo been sent through the
malls as reading matter. It Is be-
lleved that Germany has carried on a
heavy trade In this mannor, and np
uutll tho time tho British authorities
put Into effect more stringent rules.
All the ggods seized will go Into
the prlzo courts.
PRETTY HEAVY RAIN
Tho rain that hit this section Wed
nesday was tho heaviest that we
have had In somo time, 2.8 Inches of
wator falling In less than four hours.
Tho sewers of tho city wore unable
to carry off the water and tho result
was that many streets became rush
ing torrents. At the corner of Main
nnd Third tho water went over the
walks, almost blocking the traffic
at that corner for more than an hour.
J, W. Tonnlson was arrested Mon
day by Deputy McFatrldgo on a
charge pf transporting. Ho made a
bond In tho sum of $500 and was
released from custody.
. Clydo Norman has returned from
a two weeks visit with his father and
brother at Moran, Texas.

intrant's $20,000 Investment Almost
Proves to be n Wild Sort of Spec
ulation. Plant Now Thought to
1)0 Unfit for Piiiik)scs Intended.
For tho hundredth or so time, Du
rant's filtration plant has faled to
filter the city wator, right at the tlmo
when it must bo filtered. At the first
rise In Bluo at tho end of last week,
the flltor, as usual, went out of com-
1 mission, and thoso hundreds of poor
pooplo of this city who are forced
to drink city wator or do without
water, havo lmblbod tholr full share
of mud
The custom used to be, to not use
the flltor whon Old Bluo ran sublime
ly along and didn't need filtering,
foi that matter, it was not needed
then, and ovory single tlmo that Blue
got muddy the filter tailed to inter.
In othor words, whon the wator did
hot need filtering, the filter was not
not need filtering, and whon the fil
ter was closed up, it worked all right
certainly. To make a long story
short, Durant' has another $20,000
white elephant on her hands, In tho
shape of a filtration plant that we
would as well' do without, so far as
the good that comes from It Is con
corned. Durant City Council's long suits
for years was In getting stung, and
the filter Is one of tho Examples of
the work of those skilled In handing
deals to unsuspecting publics through
the medium of careless councils and
so forth. For several years water
sperlntendenta apologized for tho fil
ter and found all sorts of excuses for
its failure to do the work, and prom
ised relief which never camo. This
time Mayor Yarbrough comes clean
(which other councllmen, mayors,
superintendents and other employ
ees of the city wouldn't do, or could
not do) and says that? the filter Isn't
a filter at all, never has worked, and
.never can work. That being the case
11 is just as well to dynamite the
thing and save the city the further
expense of operating and upkeeplng
the plant.
It has been suggested that if the
cjty wants to secure a supply of good
pure drlnklnk water, that a deep well
could bo dug for a fraction of the
cost of the filter. The Durant'Ice &
Light Company owns an excellent
and never failing well at their plant,
and from this all tho water for the
boilers, Ice machines, and so forth, Is
secured, and hundreds of people
from all part3 of the town carry It
away for drinking purposes.
ESCAPED FROM ROAD GANG
Boss Harral, who has been serving
itlme on a conviction on the charge
of gambling, and who has been at
work on tho county road gang, Is re
ported to have mado his escape from
the orow Wednesday. Harral, whoso
home Is In tho neighborhood of Ben-
i nlngton, had only
a short tlmo re-
malnlng to serve. Offlcors In differ
ent portions of tho county have been
notified to be on the lookout for him.
ATTACKS COMPENSATION LAW
Supreme Court is to Pass on tho Con
stitutionality of the Act.
Appeal has been perfected In the.
Packaces of thlslcase of B. L. Adams vs. the Iten Bls-
cult Company, which was decided In
lUO UlSiriCT. UOliri lor UKUlllOma
County Saturday. Tho case lnvolvos
the constitutionality of the work-
men's compensation law and othor
phases of tho law. It has been agreed
between the attorneys for Adams,
GIddings & Llllard. and tho attorneys
for tho defendant and the State, that
the case may bo advanced by tho Su
premo Court to tho end that tho com
prehensive questions Involved in its
sevoral phases may be decided at nn
early day, thus making clear tho ex-
net scope and force of the componsa
tlon law.
Adams was severely burned in a
gas explosion In an oven la tho bis
cuit factory, and his contention Is
that his Injuries were such thnt tho
compensation bill allowed no .ade
quate relief for such Injuries and
that tho bill.ltBolf Is unconstitution
al In that It does not provide for Im
pairment or health nnd for mental
anguish, etc.

Including outstanding script ropre
sentlng unpaid premiums and expen
sos. It is stated therein that the fil
ing of numerous Individual suits will
result In costs and expenses that will
bo obviated If a receiver Is selected
and the afalrs of the Association
aro wound up amicably.
Attorneys Hayes & Mcintosh rep
resent tho plaintiff company in the
matter.
ELECTION LAW
Joint Caucus of House and Senate
Democr-it to Present New Bill Fri
day. Registration Feature There
A comprehensive plan for a new
election law, which has been worked
out by joint caucuses of House and
Senate Democrats, will be presented
to the Legislature this week, proba
bly Friday. While the plan may or
may not be adopted, It will form the
ground work for the new election
law which Is bound to come.
It contemplates a grand registra
tion law, a plan for primary elections,
and a form, for general elections.
The reglstraton .feature will re
quire all persons who expect to be el
igible to vote In tho primary or gen
eral elections to appear early In tho
year and register before the inspector
for their respective precincts. None
not registered will be permitted to
vote In any election during that year.
Perso s registering will bo required
to deo.gnato their political affilia
tions and declare as to what political
party they belong. In the primary
elections following tho voters will be
permitted to cast enly the ballots of
the political parties to which they ad
here, according to the registration
lists.
In tho primary elections voters will
mark their ballots with their first
and second choice for tho several of
fices to which nominations are made.
The ballots of each political party
will bo deposited In separate ballot
boxes. The returns will be made to
tho central committee, State, county
or district, as the case may be, of the
several political parties, duplicate re
turns and the ballot boxes to be re
turned to tho county clerks, as In the
present law. Each political party
will thus be enabled to determine all
contests as to the nominations that
may come up and to as great extent
as Is consistent with honost nomina
tions control tho primary election
proceedings as to Its own ticket. The
preferential feature of the nomina
tions Is to bo figured so that If no
candidate shal receive a majority of
tho votes for first choice, then the
votes for second cLolce that are cast
for the first choice candidatos shall
be divided, each candidate's quota
by two and added to his first choice
votes No balots bearing only ono
choice shall be counted at all. This
will prevent tho voter exerting undue
Influence on tho result by voting for
only one man.
It Is planned that the November
elections shall omploy tho ribbon bal
lot with no party emblem or dlstln
gulshlng mark of any kind save that
the' names of tho candidates may be
followed by tho namo of the political
party of which ho is a nominee. Tho
names will follow each other in a
singlo column ballot, and it is neces
sary that tho voter shall be able to
rend In ordor to astortaln who Is the
candidate for his party. Thoro Is some
disposition to carry this automatic
literacy test further and leave off the
names of tho parties so that tho vot
ers will have to know what parties
candidatos aro nominated by In ordor
to voto party tickets. Owing to tho
great length of tho ballot, however,
this may not meet with favor.
Theso provisions seem to embrace
all that is likely to meet with much
favor at tho bands of the -Democratic
caucus.

To tho Pooplo of Brynn County:
