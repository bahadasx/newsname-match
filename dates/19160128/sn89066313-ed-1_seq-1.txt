A PLAY OF CHINESE REALISM

As if Aladdin had rubbed his magic

patterned the settings after those of
tlie Chinese theater in San Francisco
which he frequented as a boy This
show house was modeled after the one
in Canton.
There are the same gorgeous cos
tumes which d.i.le with theii bril
liant hues. Tlie Chinese property man
moves silently about the stage among
the adors talking their lilies. The or
chestra in its little booth on the stage
plays ancient Chinese instruments.
Cymbals emphasize the tension during
the duel. Plaintive little tunes illus
trate a mental phase. One of William
Furst's best numbers is a love song,
which concentrates in its tinkling
bells the harmony of milenniums of
Chinese music. A special orchestra is
carried with the company.
The realism of the play is so great
tliat'one critic has said", "I could smell
the hop." It had a run of live months
at tlie Fulton Theater in New York.
A number of prominent persons who
saw it were so impressed by its pleas

setting and the charm of the love story
that they voluntarily formed a society
to boost it. They put their impres
sions into a pamphlet, which they then
circulated among their friends. Among
them were Robert W. Chambers. Mme.

What it osts a gill lo gel a illiilcr
sitv education in Missouri and how
the University girl spends her allow
ance are questions very clearly an
swered in an analysis made by Miss
Louise Stanley's class in household
problems.
Just as the commercial world has
fou.nd that the way to make the great
est progress is to analyze conditions.
Miss Stanley belives that the cost
anal) sis is the solution of problems
in the home. As a practical basis of
such anal j sis, members of her class
in household problems, a course.of
fered for the first time this jear, have
been required during the last four
months to keep accurate expense ac
counts. They have also made investi
gations as to what amount of money a
couple should have saved and what
income they should have before they
consider marrjing. Besides this they
have figured what a baby costs dur
ing its first j ear.
Each of the sixty members of the
class totaled her personal expenses
under seven headings clothing, board,
shelter, amusement, benevolence, edu
cation and incidentals. The largest
amount spent by any one of this
group of girls during the four months
was $4C0, while the smallest amount
was $115.
A sixth of these girls spent within
the neighborhood of $400; a fourth of
them spent less than $200, but the
greatest number rangod between $200
and $300.
Some Spent Half for Clothing.
Resides giving the actual figures
each girl was required to find the per
centage cost of each group of items.
Those spending the largest amounts
used about 5(1 per cent of their al
lowance for clothing. Twenty-five
per cent, however, is tlie average
amount spent for clothes. With the
exception of those girls who spent 50
per cent for clothing, food and shelter,
grouped under a single heading, are
usually the biggest item, amounting to
about half of the girl's expense.
A girl whose expense account totals
$359.80, of which clothing forms 52
per cent, added the following note:
"I wish to defend the high per cent
spent for clothing. This percent wil not
be so high the next six months or in
the whole year's account. It being
the account for fall and winter, it
included two coats and evening
dresses, which are not bought or used
in the spring and summer. The next
six months it will be a larger per
cent spent for higher life and edu
cation and a?l other items, and less
for clothing, which will make the
total per cent for clothing lower."
Another girl writes: "The amount
for clothes is very much larger this
CASH TO LLOYD RELATIVES
Several Heniembered 'With Bequests
in Columbian's Will.
The will of Simeon B. Llojd, who
died last Tuesday night at the home
of Mrs. E. U. Llojd, 1014 Walnut
street, was probated jesterday after
noon by Judge John P. Murry. Mrs.
Llojd gets $2,000 in cash and Miss

W. W. STEWART TO CHICAGO V.

semester III. ill it will be next, foi mj
clothes for nine mouths were pur
chased before leaving home."
She .Makes Her Own Clothes.
A girl whose clothing bill amounts
to $30 15 per cent of the whole
writes: "I make my own clothes and
have used nearly all of last j ear's
clo lies remodeled.
Then there's the irirl who does liaht
housekeeping who gives interesting
explanations of her figures. "I'm
paving my own way through school,"
one writes, "therefore I can't afford
sotla water and 'movies,' so I have
not set apart any amount for amuse
ment." Another tells it in this way: "I do
light housekeeping; therefore the
food cost is low. I bought very few
clothes because I had so many I
wanted to wear out. As for picture
shows and ice cream, nix haven't
the time to go, except when I go with
a boy."
Still another, whose total expense
Is $13C70 and who has set nothing
apart for amusements, writes: "This
ma) seem rather small, but I have
betn doing light housekeeping which
has been very satisfactory and also
less expensive. I have economized as
far as I tould and have had a friend
who alwavs takes me to all the places
of amusement that I care to go to."
The largest amount spent for amuse
ments during the semester by any one
of these girls was $25. The average
was $10.
Nor do benevolences figure as a
big item in the University girl's ac
counts. The majority of them make
no notation for expenditures of this
kind, preferring to figure it in with
incidentals. One girl who spent 3 per
cent of her allowance for benevolences
balanced it with an equal amount for
amusements.
13 Per Cent for Education.
Education and higher life, which
includes registration and laboratory
fees, books, lectures and concerts,
has an average of 15 per cent of the
to'al expense. One girl figures it 45
per cent, but this includes music les
sons. While it is the sorority girls whose
expense account runs tlie highest and
who spends the largest amount for
clothes, there are girls outside of the
sororities who have high clothing per
centages. With the lowest figures of expenses
for the semester as a basis, it is shown
that a girl can obtain a university
education in Missouri for as small
an amount as $900; but, on the other
hand, the higher expense accounts
show that the girl with the larger
allowance spends all of it. Her four
ears at the University cost "dad"
between $3,300 and $4,000.

CHECK ARTISTS AT WORK AGAIN
Fie Merchants Cash Bogus Paper
"Their Fault," Sajs Police Chief.
Again bad checks are afloat in Co

at least two persons of signing and
cashing the worthless paper. Chief
of Police Whitesides said today he be
lieved one of them was a student. No
arrests have been made.
Checks for $7.30 were cashed at
Levi's shoe store and the F. & M. Shoe
Parlor. The other checks, cashed at
Campbell &. Alexander's, the Virginia
Phaimacy and Henninger's jewelry
store, were for one or two dollars.
Chief Whitesides says Columbia mer
chants are too credulous.
"Instead of cashing everj-oneV
checks, the merchants could save some
money by stepping to the phone and
calling up the bank," said the cniet
this afternoon.
