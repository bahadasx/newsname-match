Garbage Collecting Co.
Fined SSO For Failure
to Follow Schedules
Fines aggregating S3O have been
imposed upon the Pennsylvania Re
duction Company for failure to make
proper collections of garbage in var
ious parts of the city.

number of complaints that had been
received around the first of the year
from many parts of town. Scores of
residents kept the phones and mails
busy with bitter messages to the
Health Board offices as to the appar
ent indifference of the garbage con

old Julius Clemens died to-day from
the effects of a quantity of acid forced
down his throat by an unidentified man

Must Keep Typhoid
Records at Hospital
in Accurate Manner
More accurate and efficient meth
ods of keeping records of the typhoid
and other contagious disease cases at
the Harrisburg Hospital will be in
sisted upon by the City Bureau of
Health and Sanitation.
The question of failure to report
typhoid cases as they develop in the
hospital will be considered at a spe
cial meeting of the bureau to be held
next week, probably Thursday. The
t bureau is now probing the apparent
neglect on the part of the hospital to
file a record of certain cases.
The State Health Department rules
require the filing of reports of typhoid
and similar cases as they develop. In
quiry has been made by the State au-
I thorities. however, as to the failure
iof the local hospital in a few in
| stances to comply with the regula
| tions. This will be insisted upon, ac
cording to Dr. J. M. J. Raunick, even
| if a new system of record keeping
j must be installed at the hospital.

By Associated Vress
New York. Jan. 28.—President Wil-j
son returned to Washington to-day, I
leaving a message to Americans to i
prepare for a time when the inter- 1 ,
i national relations of the country may j
j not be so bright as to-day. Frankly!
admitting his change of mind on thej
preparedness issue within the year, he j
called upon Americans to insist upon 1
a body of 500,000 trained citizens who
will serve as a national military re
serve immediately available under
conditions of danger.
His utterances at New York were
regarded as expressing the keynote of;
the preparedness campaign through-]
out the Middle West upon which he ;
starts late to-day. He spoke before!
the Railway Business Association ban-:
fore a gathering of 700 clergymen and [
at the banquet of the Motion Picture I
Board of Trade.
"I ca'nnot tell you what the inter-1
national relations of this country will I
be to-morrow," said the President, atl
the railway business association ban-,
quet, "and I use the word literally. I
And 1 would not dare keep silent and |
let the country suppose that to-mor-i
row was certain to be as bright as to -1
day."
Ready to Fight
Applause greeted his assertions that
"I always accept, perhaps by some!
impulse of my native blood, the invi- j
tation to a tight." and that while!
America stands for peace its people j
are "ready at any time to fight for j
the vindication of their character and;
their honor."
Suffragists who attempted to obtain i
from the President a promise to sup- j
port a woman suffrage amendment to,
the Federal Constitution were disap- 1
pointed to-day by their failure to elicit j
anything more than a reassertion ofi
1 his opinion that the suffrage issue!
! should be settled by the States.

$13,000 RAISED !
BY TWO JEWISH j
RELIEF BODIES
Small Collectors (lather More
Than $1,600 in "Tag Day"
Campaign
Jewish war reKef contributions
from this city and vicinity will total
more than $13,000 it is estimated. ,
The propoganda to raise money to]
relieve their hundreds of thousands!
of eo-religlonlsts 011 the war fronts of |
Europe was begun in this city January
16 when a Huge mass meeting of
Jewish people was held in the Technl- I
cal High School. At that time morel
than $6,400 was raised in an hour]
and a half.
The campaign was culminated yes-1
terday in a widespread observance of
"Jewish war relief day." This date
had been fixed for observance
throughout the nation and the State
by proclamations issued by President
Wilson and Governor Brumbaugh.
Jews and Gentiles were urged to con
tribute what they could.
Two committees conducted Harris
burg's campaign.
One headed by David Kaufman
operated under the jurisdiction of the
American Jewish war relief commit
tee. The other headed by Kabbi
i Silver conducted its campaign on be
j half of the Central Relief committee
lof New York. Both committees were
served by scores of young Jewish
men and girls who acted as solicitors.
The amount raised yesterday by
the Jewish war relief committee can
-1 not be definitely announced until all
jthe checks and cash contributions are
I totaled. At a meeting held in Lebanon
i last evening Rabbi Freund collected
: S7OO. Steelton also contributed several
1 hundred dollars. Checks are still
| coming in from various people in tho
I city and surrounding towns. The
synagogues have not all been heard
from. .
Rabbi Silver reported to-day that
his group of volunteer workers col
lected SI6OO. including the contribu
] tions from Steelton. This, with the
; sum already raised prior to yesterday,
; brought the total up to something
1 like $5,600. All the money collected,
|of course, will go to the aid of the
i Jews on European war fronts. This
I fund raised by Rabbi Silver and the
| money raised under the direction of
jthe Jewish war relief committee,
I amounting to something over $6,400,
! will run llarrisburg's contribution to
jat least $13,00(1 and probably more.

An Echo
Another echo of the North Third
street tragedy of several years ago
which sent Mrs. Louisa J. Bryan,
mother of Mrs. Martin Fleming, to
her death—and the husband to spend
the remainder of his life behind the
bars of the Eastern Penitentiary—was
; heard in juvenile court this morning
when John Bryan was arraigned for
stealing. John, with four other young
sters, who purloined some flashlights,
small tools, etc., from the stores of
Andrew Redmond and the West End
Electric Company. All were probated.
John's mother was Mrs. Louisa J.
Bryan. Up until the dreadful hour
when Martin Fleming's bullet ended
her life she had cared tenderly for the
boy. Since her death John's life hasn't
been exactly one of froses, according to
the juvenile court officers. His father's
religious faith is not the son's, the
court, was told. And when John was
arrested he begged the probation offi
cers not to tell his father that he fre
quently attended the church of his
mother.
Some Advise to the Court
Another youngster who had to face
the court on a truancy charge en
lightened Additional Law Judge McCar

OFFICIALS PLAN
TO CONFER WITH
BROTHERHOODS
Leading Railways to Organize
Conference Committee to
Meet Employes
WILL AFFORD MEDIUM
Realize They Have No Ade
quate Method of Meeting Ex
traordinary Situation
By Associated Press
New York, Jan. 28.—Officials of the
leading railways of the United States
are considering a plan to organize
a general conference committee of the
railway managers of the whole coun
try to negotiate with representations 1
of the four brotherhoods of railway
employes which are voting on the
question whether to demand an eight
hour working day. It is stated that
it this plan is put into effect it will 1
be the first time in the history of the
country.
The plan har been proposed because
it is realized that the railway officials
j have no adequate method of meeting
(the extraordinary situation now con
fronting them. Never before has
j t here been a labor movement of such
j magnitude among railway employes,
say the officials.
Conference Now
There is at present a conference of
railway managers in each of the three
districts into which the country is
divided but the functions of each are
restricted to the territory in which its
road operates. There are also the
. American Railway Association with
, members from all parts of tht United
j States but it has none of the powers
■ proposed to be conferred upon the
| general conference,
i Although the plans for the proposed
conference committee are not fully
| developed-the general aim is to draw
Its members from among the railway
I managers composing the conferences
iof the eastern, southern and western
j districts.
The national conference is Intended
| to afford the operators and the broth
|crhoods a medium through which the
| eight-hour issue can be discussed as
j affecting the entire country without
splitting the negotiations into districts.
The proposal is understood to have the
endorsement of labor officials who as
serted that they wanted to confer with
the railroad officials as a general body.
