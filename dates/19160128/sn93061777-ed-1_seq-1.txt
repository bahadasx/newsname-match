The Ballot Will
VOTE FOR PROHIBITION
SAYS PROF. D. N. CROFT
In the Following Communication froea Prof. D. N. Croft,
the Prohibition Question it Handled Without GIotm.
. The Argument He Presents is Stronger than any the
Imported Speakers Hare Yet Advanced t
This (luestion is at the present
agitating the minds of many of
the voters of Clovis.
When viewed from a manly, a
sane standpoint, thesolutioa is
simple aud the answer easily
arrived at.
1st. Vote -For conditions that
will tend to elevate the social
life to tho highest plain of moral
excellence.
Vote To remove from your
boys as far as possible, every
temptation for the use of in
toxicants. Vote -For conditions that will
foster the best educational ad
vantages for our boys and girls,
and afford them the bent oppor
tunities to develop into Great
and Noble men and women of
prolific minds. Excessive use of
intoxicants not only stu pities,
stultifies, impoverishes and
makes both mental and physical
wrecks of the parents that use
it, butalao makes degenerates
and dwarfs of their offspring.
You are your brother's keeper;
the Holy scriptures teach this
therefore,
Vote To protect th home of
your neighbor from the ravages
of rum and rescue or relieve the
heart broken and half clad, "halt
starved wife and neglected
children of the drunkard from
their grief, sufferings, and un
told agonies of both mind and
body.
Vote To prevent that pure
helplesfl, innocent, unsuspecting
Jaugcter from falling into the
beastly clutches of a drunkard,
and prevent that promising boy
from Ailing a drunkard's grave
und a drunkard's Hell.
If you would consider this
matter from a business stand
point,
Vote-For conditions that will
meet the requirements for pro
curing the State Nornal that our
State coriHtitution provides for
to be located in Eastern New
Mexico, (hut which will not un
dor any circumstances be located
among saloons;. Tnis and other
substantial improvements, that
will, certainly follow, will posi
tively insure a "Bigger and
Hotter Clnvis."
Vote - To obtain all the above
and 'many more" ood thirifis
for Clovm, fnr home, and for
society.
Vote -THK DRY TICKET."
D.f cani thn saloons and you wilt
mautri.ita'.o an iiu'lucnee tii;it vv i 1 1
result in fioiiliin;,r the population
of Clovis and Curry County in a
tew years lime.
Prom . a moral or religious
s!and point, it is the DUTY of
every rational voter to vote
aiainst the saloon; and from a
husiness stand point it will be
greatly to the interests of every
property owner to vote out the
saloons. There is not a single
logical reaHon for voting the
continuance of the saloons, but
"every" reaion why you should
vote to close them.
Don't be misled by the false
statements of the saloon ele-
SIDES OF THE
Official Newepaper of the United State Land Office and of the People
ment. The Mighty prohibition
wave that is sweeping over, not
only the United States, but the
entire Globe, has so demoralized
and terrorized them, that they
will falsify, vilify and resort to
anything, in their mad effort to
obtain a little relief. Their
cause (I should say "Curse") is
becoming so hopeless, they fully
realize that it is in the last
throes of death, and they will
clutch to a straw in their last
desperate efforts to hold a little
footing. Saloon snd whiskey
sympathizers tell you that pro
hibition does not prohibit and
that there is more drunkenness
and intemperance in territory
voted dry, than when the sa
loons were running. These are
damnable lies, uttered by igno
ramuses. Reliable government
statistics show a wonderful de
crease in the consumpsion of
soirits. The late report of the
commissioner of internal reve
nue. Wm. H. Osborne, for the
flues! ye? ending June 30th,
lf15. shows a decrease of over
10,000 liquor dealers during the
past year. With 16,000 saloons
put out of business, in one year,
doesn't that mean something?
Don't you suppose that will
"Prohibit" the sale and con
sumption of at least a few gal
lons of the demon run? The
same report further shows a de
crease in the consumption of
fruit brandies and spirits dis
tilled from grain of over 15.003.
000 gallons, and a decrease in
the consumption of beer of over
7.000,000 barrels, and with the
additional 9 new dry states, this
decrease will more than double
the coming year. Isn't that
some "prohibition?" We do not
expect our present prohibition
lawn to "entirely" prohibit
drunkenness any more so than
our laws against murder and
theft will entirely prohibit kill
ing and stealing. You might as
well endeavor to Hy to the moon,
as to stop the confirmed, ex
cessive drinker from getting his
whiskey. "Get it. he will" if he
has to go through fire to obtain
it. you can't stop "him" from
drinking. He's gone. But it
lis our object to "prohibit" or
abolish the wide-open Saloon in
Clovis ami thus save aa far as
'pussihle tin-; risinjr penoration.
In an article uppcavirir in last
week's isjsue of the "News." a
a plea for the open saloon, the
writer unable to produce any
sane argument in its favor, in
his utter desperation clutched
the old rotten thread of "Person
al Liberty." Does this kind of
"Personal liberty," he is pro
claiming mean that the modest
respectable class of citizens of
Clovis and vicinity must submit
to, and endure a continuation of
the stench, debauchery, the de
pravity of the saloon, in order
to satisfy his idiotic whimseys
in what "he" terms "Personal
Liberty"' ?7? I f this writer

well to know the writer; when
Lo and behold! a gentleman in
the audience raised his hand and
said: "Sir, 'I am the man who
wrote that article," the Rev,
Arthur Jones began to abuse
him in a most insulting manner.
Hundreds of farmers and dis
interested men, who were pres
ent made the statement after
wards that never in their lives
dad they listened to any man
whq used such an insulting
manner in speaking to a gentle
man. This kind of talk coming
trom a minister caused these
disinterested people to wonder
why the prohibition campaign
managers would resort to such
lactics to defend their cause.
Mien the Kev. Arthur Jones
closed his argument, then Hon.
.Stanley J. Clark, a resident and
practicing attorney of this city,
and who wrote the article
in the paper, that Rev. Jones
nad referred to. and the man
wno had calmly taken the abuse
of tr.e paid otatar, arose and be

Jones stepped forward on his
wagon and assured the audience
that no matter what Clark might
say or do, he would make him
look like a ninny, and that he
would skin him alive in any
debate, at any time, on this
question, and Jones pleaded
with the people to stay and hear
him clean up on Clark if he
spoke. It will be remembered
that the first sentence in Mr.
Clark's speech was this: "I
hereby challenge the Rev. Mr.
Jones to mett me in a series of
debates at any time, at any place,
OF CLOVIS.
FIRE and AUTOMOBILE
INSURANCE
Baker Brothers
Agency
U.00 PER YEAH
Monday.
EXPLAIN
ALL HAPPENED
on the subject of prohibition."
He issued his challenge with all
fairness and all candor on this
question, "That prohibition is
not the practical solution of the
liquor problem." And while
the Rev. Mr. Jones spoke agaio
after this challenge was made,
he carefully ignored the chal
lenge; he refrained from men
tioning it in the least way, and
from his action it was taken
by the audience that he wis
afraid, with his flimsy argu
ment, to try to meet the wonder
ful and strong argument aa pro
duced by Clark.
During Clark's speech Rev.
Messer, one of the ministers of
Clovis, interrupted by asking
him numbers of questions. Mr,
Clark took from his pocket a
copy of the Gibbs letter, which
was written to Mr. Ira R. Gibbs,
a citizen of Clovis, by Mr. Mes
ser. Mr. Clark showed by this
letter the length to which the
prohibitionists would go to se
cure votes for their cause in this
campaign. Mr. Clark showed
by the Gibbs. letter that the pro
hibitionists had even gone so far
as te possibly violate the corrupt
practice act of the State of New
Mexico in order to secure votes.
He showed also that they had at
tempted to use boycott. That

year 1907, the year the prohi
bition law went into effect ia '
that state, crime had increased

the State of Oklahoma is burden
ed with taxes. In fact he dem
onstrated clearly to the audi
ence by his facts and figures
that Oklahoma is almost in a
state of bankruptcy. He took
up an article in the Clovis Jour
nal, which paper has appealed
to the farmers of Curry county
to come in and assist in placing
whiskey in the hands of boot
leggers, and showed clearly to
the audience where that paper
tried to work an injury to the
farmers, instead of trying to
benefit them. He demonstrated
to the llev. Mr. Jones that he
knew more about the bible than
Jones did. He showed how Rev.
.longs' argument was to boycott
the anti htiiiness man if he fail
ed to come across and vote the
pro ticket. He showed also to
the Uev. Mr. Jones and his corps
of attending ministers that there
are ma-.y evils in the world that
are fir greater than the liquor
qut-stion, but which they calm
ly and seemingly purposely
ignored, but yet they would take
ud the liquor question because
the liquor dealers would not
fight back. He took up the
thread of the argument that
Rev. Jones had used in both of
his speeches. . He took it up
sentence by sentence, line by
line and word by word. Ue
said that Rev. Jones was work
ing purely and simply for
prohibition for the money that
was in it. He showed where
