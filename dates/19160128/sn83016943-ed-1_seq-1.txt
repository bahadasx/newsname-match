FROM THE PEOPLE.
To the Editor of The Beacon.
1 see my good friend, F. A. T., has
given me credit for introducing a bill
containing a redemption clause in
mortgages; while the enactment of such
a measure is a cherished hope, still I'm
not the author of either of the three
ills - one in the senate and two in tbe
house for the reason that while inves
tigating tbe statutes upon the subject
In the different states, these bills were
prepared and introduced by young men
who are ambitious and hsve hopes of a
political future, which does not appeal
to a man of my age. Hence I'm act
ing conjointly (he assuming authorship
of the measure) with Senator Adams
of Pontotoc, with the hope that a bill
may be eventually framed that will
meet the requirement of the common
wealth of the state, and become a fix
ed statute.
The observations and experiences of
F, A. T. while a citizen of the State of
Illinois, both before and after the en
actment of the redemption rights,
should be a good argument in favor of
a like statute in Mississippi.
J. Q. POINDEXTEH.
iVofice to Boyt in Clab Work.
As promised in last week's Beacon,
I will give more particulars about the
Pig club and Corn club work for the
boys rf this county,
The corn club work is not new to a
great many boys of the county who
have faithfully enlisted for several
years, and have made creditable show
ings at the end of the year. But this
year, having the assurance or the state
agent that he will be of active help to
us. I am expecting that a goodly num
ber of our boys will enlist who have not
done so heretofore. ' It is my earnest
desire to enroll aa many as one hun
dred boys in the corn club. Write me
at once of your ' desire to become a
member, and I will see to it that you
are properly enrolled, and that you get
all the encouragement and assistance
which it is possible for the state agent
and myself to give you.
Now, every member of the com club
ought to be a member of the pig club,
and vice versa, every pig club member
ought to be a member of the corn club.
But this is not required. I know that
there are lots of boys who can not car
ry on both, but try it, at least to join
one. The state has an agent whose
business it is to furnish the instructions,
bulletins, blanks, etc,, by which the
pig club members are to be guided.
The purpose of the pig club is to
create and promote an interest among
boys of the state for more and better
hogs; to teach the art of hog raising
and to inspire them with thrift and
love for farm life.
Any boy who is between the ages of
ten and eighteen years is entitled to
membership.
The county pig club shall be under
the control cf the county superintend
ent of education, the Home Economics
agent, and the principal of the Agri
cultural High school as the executive
committee, the state agent, however,
will be a member of this committee on
the part of the state. Let me say here
that scrub pigs will not be allowed in
the state show, and will not receive
much consideration in the county show
as compared with pure bred hogs.
It shall be the duty of each member
of this club to enroll his name with the
ounty superintendent. It shall also be
the duty of each member:
To secure at least one pig of the age
to be determined by the executive com
mittee, To give this committee satisfactory
assurance that he can and will care for
and feed his big acording to the in
structions of the state agent which will
he furnished him as he needs them.
To make all the monthly and annual
reports required of him by the direct
ing authorities.
To exhibit his pig at the county ex
hibit to be held at Macon some time in
the fall.
Appropriate prizes will be given to
the winners. These prizes snd the
points considered in awarding them will
be announced soon. Suffice it to say
that the prizes will be worth workirg
for but no boy who does not expect to
hustle need not enter the contest fori
the hustler is sure to win.
Now, I had rather thefe clubs were
organized in each school by the teach
er, and the names w ie sent in by ber;
but if the teacher rces not do this, do
not be discouraged. Send your name
directly to me, at d 1 will enroll you.

Senator Vardaman of Missis
sippi, and Senator Smith of Geor
pria, sorely cannot be represent
ing the people of their states in
the positions they continue to oc
cupy in the upper branch of Con-:
Kress, They are posing more aa
obstructionists than helpers to
the work of the administration,
yet the party which placed them
in office is behind the adminis
tration. They each seem to have
lost their minis on the question -of
cotton and the fact that Eu-,
rope is not buying the surplus in '
this country and paying the high-
est of prices therefor. They
have no mind to the other com-1
modities sold by the people of '
this government , nor the fact '
that they are being bought in
quantities; that the money they ;,
would like for all urope which
can reach our markets is spend
ing for necessities, such as food
and ammunition and manufac
tured clothing, can't be spent
alone for cotton and that in the .
bale. Should they turn their at
tention toward helping the ad
ministration get through some '
measure that would give ships
for the transportation of cotton.
rather than acting the part of
obstructionists they would serve
these people better.
England needs food and muni
tions more than the needs cot
ton, as badly as she needs the
latter. Her ships are carrying
food and munitions and leaving
cotton at the wharf.
Cotton would be going to Eng-
and today if Vardaman and Hoke
Smith and a few other Democrats
had not turned against the Pres
ident and fought bis shipping bill
a; year ago. The cotton states
are paying the penalty for their
desertion. -News-Democrat, Pa-
