Maj. Helburn Acquitted
Middlesboro, Ky., Maj. E. S.
Helburn, former Mayor of Mid
dlesboro, was acquitted here to
day on the charge of killing Alf
Farmer, upon motion of County
Attorney C. I. Dawson, after all
the evidence had been introduced
by the Commonwealth and it
was clearly shown that Maj, Hel
burn was justified in taking the
life of Alf Farmer to save the
life of Lee Rennebaum.
The examining trial was held
before Magistrates J. Y. Page,
of Pineville, and John Hurst, of
Middlesboro, in the absence of
County Judge T. J. Asher. Their
verdict was justifiable homicide.
Farmer had assaulted a woman
in the comissary of the Yellow
Creet Coal Company. Renne
baum, an employee of the com
pany, tried to make Farmer
cease, Farmer then turned on
Ronnebaum with a gun and fired
one shot, when Helburn shot
Farmer. Maj. Helburn came
here from Louisville several
years ago and is much interested
in the coal developement in this
section.

Wreck on Cumberland
Wednesday evening just before

Railroad Train was coming out
to Artemus and right at the
junction they had a wreck of a
box car completely demolishing
it. Capt. Lou Webb, the Con
ductor, and Arnold Kice the flag
man, were both on top of the car
at the time it left the track, they
both jumped so as to avoid death.
Capt. Webb sustained a broken
arm just above the wrist, and
otherwise shook up. Mr. Rice
has no broken bones, yet, he is
awfully sore, though neither of
the boys are seriously hurt.

Medical Meeting a Suc
cess. Last Monday, as was announc
ed, the Knox County Medical So
ciety met in the county court
room and had a most interesting
meeting with the house crowded.
The house was called to order
by Dr. G. II. Albright and the
program was proceeded with.
The first address was delivered
by Dr. J. S. Lock, the subject
being a reference to the law of
registration and care for the
newly born baby, which was a
most interesting address.
The next speaker was Miss
Linda Neville, ot Lexington.
Her subject was diseases of the
eve, trachoma. It was the best
address ever delivered b any
woman in this city. It was full
of good common sense, mixed
with many pathetic stories of
her experience. It was well
worth any one's time to have
heard it.
After Miss Neville. Dr. Te
read a paper on Midwifery, which
was well taken by all present.
Dr. W. B. Dossier made a short
address on the use of chloroform
as did Dr. Burnside and others.
The resolutions which were
passed are as follows:
Resolved, that, we, citizens of
Knox County, Kentucky, assem
bled in mass meeting in the Court
house at Barbourville on this,
twenty-fourth day of Jan., 101(5,
hereby urge Sen. James. Sen.
TWklirmi and Conirressinan Pow
ers to work earnestly for an in
creased federal appropriation for
the cure and the prevention of'
trachoma in Kentucky.
It has come the ears the editor
of this paper that the friends of
Dr. W. C. Black, are going to
urge him to make the race for
the office -of County Judge of
Knox County. We have not talk
ed with Dr. Black and do not pre
tend to say what he wil' do in
the matter, but we do know Dr.
Black, and he is a hard worker
ajt anythig that he goes into, and
we know that if was Judge he
would make some Judge.
