IV O ACTION XKC1.KSAHY
BY INITKD STATKS J
Washington, Jan. 27. There was noj
Indication tonight that the united
Ktates government would consider any
action necessary in the case of the
two American soldiers captured yes
terday by armed Mexicans near
Brownsville, Tex., and returned un
harmed to their commands today, oth
er than to investigate, tho incident and
probably courtmartlal Lieutenants
Peyton, Mort and Waldron the offi
cers who led the detachment of sol
diers into Mexican ten-Story to rescue
their captured comrades.
Secretary Garrison said positive or
ders had been given to every officer
in the army not to cross the boundary
under any provocation without spe
cific Instructions from Washington.
Should tho investigation ordered by
Major General Funstoii prove that the
officer violated this order, it was
liiiid, they undoubtedly would be court
martialed and probably held responsi
ble for the death of the four soldiers,
members of the rescue party, who
were drowned in the Kio Grande while
returning from their expedition.
Tim prompt action taken by Car
ranza military authorities in returning
the two soldiers was regarded by state
department officials as indicative, of
their r!iuirn tr rr,tn 1 II nf wellOft

For more than two horns Doyle,
with a mass of letters, document and

had approved the ucts of the Inter

from the record all tho remarks of
Doylewas tarried by an overwhelm
ing vote.
While Makes Hot Kcply.
Doyle's attack was one of the sen
sations of the convention. The dele
gates appeared to be so eager to vote
on the question of approving the ads
of tho Intel national officers that Vice
President , Hayes Was unable to gain
the floor to make a reply and gave no
tice that be would make a statement
later. Pmident White made a heated
reply In which be declared that Iole
had dime Irreparable injuiy to the
Htrugglln:, mine workers of Colorado.

ted the rank and flle'of the organiza
tion had Hood nobly by the Colorado
strikers and gratefully acknowledge!
that 3,6'J5.5H4 had been sent Into the
stute to help will the struggle. He
declared, however, that some of the
national officers in the summer of
mi 4 did not show the same zeal in
conducting the strike as they had at
the beginning. He alleged that W.
K. Fairley, of Alabama, and N ice
President Hayes had offered a plan
of settlement which was uiisittlsfiie
lory to Ioyle and other district off i
ceM; that I'alrlcy burned all copies i f
tho plan supposed to h in existence,
and that later this identical plan
turned up as President Wilson's plan
which called for a three-year truce.

Letters purporting to have been
written by detectives of a national de-l

which it was stated that the agency I

made between the operators and min

one of the West Virginia fields. He,
had no faith, he said, that the fed-j
eral commission sent to Colorado by i
President Wilson would accomplish I
anything that would help the miner
there.
President White in his reply de
.lured Ihui it was idle to believe thai
the attack on the international organi

been assailed, he declared, in order I"
I bring discredit upon his administra

knew about Colorado and Jeopardize

T't of Inn Addi'ivM.
In his addies at thn Hallway as
sociation banquet. President AYllson
said; ' ; ', i
"Tho exactions ot my official du
ties recently have been' so treat
that il has bet-ii very keldont Indeed
that I could bIvo myself no great a
pleasure as that which I am enjoy
ing tonight. It la a. great pleusure
to como and l)o greeted In u.'h gen
ernus fashion by men ho thoughtful
us yourselves und so deeply engaged
in Homo of tha most .Important, un
dertakings of the, nation: and I con
sider it Ih a privilege to bo permitted
to lay before you- some of tho things
to which we ought to give our most
careful and deliberate consideration.
lihu question,, it swnm to .me. wiuou
I most" demands "clarification Just now
Is the question of preparation for
national defense. ' ,
Concnlo lloiiosly to Opjxmcntrt,
"I say that It stands In need of
clarification because, singularly
enough, It lias been deeply clouded
by passion and prejudice. It is very
singular that a questlou, tho elements
of which are so simple und so
obvious, should havo been Ho be
clouded by tho discussion of men of
high motlvo, men of as high purpose
as any of us may claim and yet ap
parently Incapable of dlvesllng 'them
selves of that sort of provincialism
which consists In thinking the con
tents of their own minds to bo tho
contents of the iiilnil of tho world.
For, gentlemen, whllo America Is a
great nation; while America con
tains all Hie element of fine forco
and accomplishment, America does
not constitute the major part of lllu
world.
Practical View of World.
"We live In ii world which wo did
not make, which we cannot alter,
which we cannot , think into a (IIN
'. rent condition from tliat which act
ually exists. It would bo a hopeless
piece of provincialism to supposu
that, because t think differently
fro, o I lie rest if Ibe world.' we are
at liberty to assume that, the rest
nf the world will permit us to en-
tbal thought without disturb-
i nee.
"Il ii. a surprising olrcumstunen
'also that men should allow partisan
j foiling or personal umblllon lo creep
Into the discussion of this funds-
mental thing. How can Americans
I differ uliout the safety of America.'
"And I, for my part, am ambitious
that Amotion should do a greater and
more difficult thing than the great
nulloiiH on the other aide of the water
have done. In all the belligerent
countries, men without distinction of
party have drawn together to accom
plish a successful prosecution of tht
war. Is ,lt riot a more difficult and
more desirable thing that all Ameri
cans should put partisan passion asido
anil draw togethed for the successful
prosecution of pence? I covet that
distinction for America and I believo
tliat America is goin? to enjoy lhat
distinction.
