FARRAR SCHOOL.
School at this place closed last
Friday, January 21. The . term
just ended was a very successful
one and was taught by.Rufus A.
Durham. Everyone regrets that
so good a school should close so
soon and that Mr. Durham will not
remain here but will go to his home
in- Humphreys County.
He was liked by all.who knew
him, especially by his pupils, to
whom he was always teaching some
thing beneficial. He was kind to
all and by that we were taught to
love him and each other. We all
ask that he be sent to us for the
next term. Although he drew a
salary only for teaching his school
he worked both inside and out of
' the scliool house and his influence
can be felt throughout this com
munity. - The closing exercises were very
simple. After a few words by Mr,
Durham he was presented with sev
eral tokens of remembrance by his
pupils and Miss Queen Cuff read
the following papert "We, the.
pupils of this, the Farrar School,
wish to thank you for the kindness
you have shown us and the interest
you have taken in our learning and
betterment. -You have not only
taught us book knowledge but have
taught us to love and to be kind to
one another. - We wish you much
jby and happiness in this life and,
at lust, a'home. in Heaven. We
would be pleased to have you teaGh
"our school again.""

STEWART CO.
, The Winnie Stewarl Company,
who are Jogive the first of a three
number Lyceum Course at the
high school, will appear, here on
Friday eveuing, January 28. This

whose hearers have always been

numbers) or singly (good for only
oue number.) The price for the

The history of the lyeeum is very
interesting. It dates back to 530,
B. C, when Pisistratus, a tyrant of
the Greek city, Athens, founded a
sort of theatre outside the walls of
Athens for the purpose of enter
tainments. Pisistratus was a pa
tron of Art and gave this lyeeum to
the people of Athens in token of
his regard for them and through
his great love for the beautyof
music and poetry. The place was
always the resort of singers and
poets. The great philosopher, Ar
istotle, taught there. The policy
of the lyeeum has changed some
what from the old idea just as the
Olympic games have changed, but
it yetstauds for the be6t and high
est type of beauty and song just as
the ancient Greek gave in the Ly
ceum of Athens. .

instrument of the Lyceum Course
because it was one of the instru
ments upon which the Greeks
played. The harp is so named
from the Greek god, jEolns, god of
the winds. Jt was said his breath
played on the strings of the harp
and caused the sweet tones. If
jEolus were glad the song would
be gay; if he were angry the tones
would be harsh aud rough.' Thus
he displayed his temperament.'
