j. WHERE SALES REALLY TAKE PLACE
It is easier to make goods than to sell them. I know
I a man who has been in the manufacturing business
i all his life, and he says it took him some time to find
j this out. Any man with money can buy machin-
I ery and hire men to run it and make goods, but it
j does not follow because he can do that he can sell
I those goods. His money is of no use if he cannot
sell those goods after they are made. He said it
took him some time to find out that the making of
the goods is the least.
I When you are manufacturing goods you are
j dealing both with men and metals, -and you can put
a thousand more men to work and make more
goods. But when you cross the line and attempt
j to sell those goods you will meet with a different
; proposition.
1 1 When you make a sale of anything, whether in
? a retail store or on the road, no matter what it may
; be, that sale does not first take place in the order
book or over the counter in the pocketbook or in
i the check book.
s , But every sale, whether it be a paper of pins or
jj 1 a grand piano, first takes place in the mind of the
j j- person who buys the goods.
;? A lawyer is as much of a salesman as a busi-
I j1 ness man, and should use the same tactics as any
1 L other man who is selling things, because he is al-
i Ways trying to sell the judge and jury his side of
I'l the case. ' . . . ,
1 When you put this matter of influencing the
? human mind on such a broad plane you can see that
in nearly all of our relations of life we are using the
ll; principles of advertising and salesmanship.

Review of War Situation.
Moro than half a million casualties
have been suffered by the British
forces so far In the war. The official
figures giving the total up to January
9, made public place at 549,467, the
number ibelng up of 24,122 officers
and 525,345 men.
The Austrlans and Bulgarians ap
pear to be attempting to overrun the
country. Little effective opposition
is apparent. The entente powers
seem to be placing reliance on Essad
Pasha to hold th6 forces of the Teu
tonic allies in check. The Greeks are
said to be reinforcing their detach
ments at Albanian border points.

New York, Jan 28. Numerous Ger
man submarines have been sighted in
the war zone around the British Isles
during the last few weeks, according
to passengers who arrived today on
the steamship California from Liver
pool and Glasgow. The sailing of the
steamer was delayed one day, owing
to the presence of U boats and the
California was escorted by torpedo
boats until safely outside the war
zone.
The Russians "are waking up in
everj' way." according to Dr. Freder
ick W. Eastman, a passenger on the
California, who has been acting as a
Red Cross surgeon In Russia and Ser
bia for more than a year.
"Heretofore the Russians have
fought solely as a duty," said Dr. East
man, "but they are now strongly an

trians and are entering the war with
a vengeance."

correspondent of the Secolo. Their
advance guards were reported on
"Wednesday near Kroia and It is stat

with their weapons.
Bulgarians In southern Albania are
said to be marching from Berat. to

"This conference, in view of the un

W. E. Cross, seconding the resolu

NOTE SENT ALL
BELLIGERENTS
United States Asking All War
ring European Nations to
Make General Subma
rine Agreement.
ULTIMATUM ISSUED
Attitude of American Govern
ment Toward Undersea War
fare and Rights of Mer
chant Vessels Clearly
Outlined.
Washington Jan. 28. The Italian
liners Amerlc and Verona will be per
mitted to sail frbm New York If the
Italian government gives assurances,
as it did in the case of the Guiseppe
Verdi, that their guns will be used
only for defensive purposes.
1ST AD NOTE SENT
Late today Secretary Lansing for
mally announced that such a note had
been sent to the belligerents. He said
It was purely In the interest of hu
manity and did not bind the United
States5 to any new principles if it
were not accepted.
Washington, Jan. 28. The United
States, in askipg all European belli
gerents to make a general agreement
to square their submarine warfare
with the principles of humanity has
taken the position that under chang
ed conditions of naval warfare mer
chant ships should carry no arma
ment whatever.
All the powers have been notified
that unless they subscribe to such
principles, armed merchantmen will
be denied entry to American ports
except under the conditions which ap
ply to warships.
Proposal Now Before Nations.
Such a proposal now in the hands
of the belligerent governments has
been transmitted in a note which is
substantially as 'follows:
"It is assumed that all of the gov
ernments addressed are equally de
sirous of protecting their own sub
jects and citizens who are non-combatants
from the hazards of submarine
warfare.
"Realizing the appalling loss of life
of non,-cqmbatants which results from
the destruction of a merchant vessel
without removing passengers and
crews to places of safety, which is
held to be violative of the principles
of humanity and international law,
the United States at the same time
does not feel that a belligerent should
be deprived of the right to use sun
marines in view of the usefulness that
they have developed.
Just Formula Needed.
"That a formula may be found com
pletely within the rules of interna
tional law and humanity, which will
require in its adoption only a trifling
change In the practices which have
obtained in the past and before the
war, which formula would be just and
fair to all belligerents, it is proposed
that:
First, a non-combatant has the right
lo traverse the high seas in a merch
ant ship entitled to fly a belligerent
flag and to rely upon the rules of
international law and the principles
of humanity if the vessel is approach
ed by a belligerent war vessel.
Second, a merchant vessel of any
nationality should not be subject to
attack until the belligerent warship
has warned her to stop.
Any Merchantman Should Obey.
Third, any belligerent-owned mer
chant vessel should promptly obey any
order from a belligerent warship to
stop.
Fourth, no such merchant vessel
should be fired on uiftil she tries to
flee or to resist by 'force and even in
such case any attack upon her by the
warship must stop as soon as the
flight or resistance ceases
Fifth, only in case it should be im
possible for military reasons for the
warship to supply a prize crew or to
convoy the merchant ship into port
will she be justified in sinking such
merchant vessel and in that case pas
sengers and crew must be removed
to a place of safety.
U. S. Appreciates Difficulties.
The state department is full appre
ciable of the obstacles which the adop
tion of these rules would place in the
way of the operations of the submar
ines, because of their structural weak
ness. Before the present war, mari
time warfare on the high seas always
has been conducted by battleships or
cruisers carrying heavy guns. It is
true that merchantmen were permit
ted to carry defensive armament, but
they were light, compared with the
warships, and did not change their
nature as merchant vessels. This was
based on the superior defensive
strength of the warships and the limi
tation upon their armaments was for
the purpose of limiting their power
of resistance to contract with pirates
and privateers.
Conditions All Changed.
The introduction of the submarine
into naval warfare has changed all of
this. This craft is almost without
powers of defense beyond the ability
to submerge to escape an enemy. A
gun even of light .caliber on a. mer
chant ship successfully could defend
herself against a submarine. There
arc now no pirates and the practice
of privateering has been abandoned
by civilized nations by general agree
ment. Therefore there can bo now no rea-
son for the maintenance of even small
caliber guns on merchant ships unless
it Is designed to make them superior
to submarines and thereby deprive
that class of warships of their un
doubted right with safoty to warn and
search such merchantmen. In reality,
therefore any such armament of a
merchant vessel now can be regarded
as offensive armament.
Unfair to Submarines.
If submarines should be requested
to stop and search merchant vessels
before attacking them and to remove
the passengers and crews to places
of safety, it is not fair that the sub
marine should be compelled to expose
themselves to destruction at the
hands of merchantmen.
Therefore, by a general agreement
among the belligerents, submarines
should be requested to adhere strict
ly to the present provisions of inter
national law to stop and search mer
chant ships Ho ascertain their belliger
ent character and to remove the pas
sengers and crews to safety before
sinking them.
On the other hand merchant vessels
should not be permitted to carry any
armament at all.
Legal Right Doubted.
There is grave doubt of the legal
right to carry armament on merchant
ships, and it is submitted that all na
tions should be animated by a desire
to save the lives of Innocent people
and therefore should not insist upon
the exercise of any technical right.
Is your government willing to make
such a declaration conditioned on a
similar declaration by its enemies?
The United States has been very
much impressed with the arguments
that have been advanced In certain
auarters that any merchant vessel
which carries guns in any position
capable of use against warships, has
forfeited her non-combatant character
and may be regarded as an auxiliary
cruiser aud is therefore seriously con
sidering the announcement of a pur
pose treat the vessels on that basis
because of the changed conditions in
maritime warfare resulting from the
introduction of the submarine and its
defenseless character.
The foregoing is substantially the
note which Secretary Lansing an
nounced yesterday had been transmit
ted to a "foreign power of powers."
He refused to discuss the subject
further.
U. S. Fails to Receive Note.
Washington, Jan. 28. The United
Slates has addressed another Inquiry
to Austria asking if any of its sub
marine commanders have knowledge
of the destruction of the British liner
Persia. A statement that they had
none, reported to have been handed
to Ambassador Penfieid several days
rgo, never has been received here.
