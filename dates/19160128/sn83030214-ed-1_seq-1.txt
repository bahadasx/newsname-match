Warmest January 11 on Record, with ?Mercury at 66 Here?
?Alaska Children Go Barefoot, While Dululh Is
Snowbound?Cold Wave Coming.
Some irresponsible hand turned on
every faucet in the Weather Hureau
ye.-ter.lav and deluged the? country
with a scrambled assortment of sun?
shine, snow, hurricanes, zephyrs, sum?
mer blasts and tvintry storms.
The medley was so eonfusintr that
it may be several days before the
weather expert? onn readjuit affairs
and give every rart of the country the
variety of climate? it is normally ex?
pected to have at this season of the
year. Bliizards were reported last
night where moderate climate is the
right of the inhabitants, pansies
bloomed where snow should fall, and
spring showers drenched landscapes
accustomed to sleet and bail in Jan?
uary.
Fortunately, the faucet labelled
"Hare June Pay*" was poured over
New York and environs. It was the
warmest January 27 on record. At
0:30 p. BB, the mercury reached 66.5
degrees. This wus within four-tenths
of a degree of the hottest January* day
in Weather Bureau history. The result j
at an overcoated and woollen-clad '
city perspired, leaves peeped forth |
froaB trees and twenty-five children i
wandered away from homes on the ?
loarai East Sida thinking that spring i
had arrived. The leaves are scheduled |
for a frosty greeting within a few
days, and the children are being held
at three police stations nwaiting
parents.
Apparently the experts will readjust
Nats Turk'? climate first. It was an
nounced last night that co!,l??r weather
would arrive to-day, and that there
was a possibility that snow flurries or
rain might accompany it.
Residents of Lealsvilla were prepar?

midsummer weather was ppilled over

ending yesterday afternoon, the mer?

At Winsted, Conn., pansies blooming
might have caused considerably more
exultation but for the fact that a local

Washington, Jan. 27. An outburst of

belligererts itirred the Senate to-day.
refleetiag a revival of sentiment which
may force a vote upon embargo reso?
lutions that have been pending in com?
mittee for several months.
A dozen Senators, Democrats as well
as Republicans, assailed the munitions
traffic, while those who have sided with
the administration in its stand that an
embargo woifld violate international
law were for the most part silent.
A petition for an embargo, bearing
more than a million signatures, started
the debate. A test vote at one time ;
teemed inevitable, but it was averted
after much parliamentary manoeuvring
by ref?rence of the petition to the For
c'gn Relations Committee.
I'etHimi Sent by Women.
Senator Kenyon, Iowa, Republican,
presented the petition, which had been
sent to the Senate by the organization |
of American Women for Strict Neutral-?

The petition expressed "earnest pro-;

the exportation from this country ofj
'the thing? which kill' for the use ofj
the nations engaged in the pr?tent BS -

"Germany did not permit her citizen?

"The rigners of these petitions are
not pro-llritish, not pro-German, but I
they are pro-American, pro-humanity,
pro-Christianity," he said. "The tre?

Neutrality Breach Suggested.
An embargo was vigorously urged also
by Senators Hitchcock, Clapp, Works,
Ashurst, Lane, Martine and La Fol?
lette. Other Senators who spoko in
favor* of rn embargo were Clarke, of
Arkansas; Clark, of Wyoming; Smoot
and Townsend.
?Senator Stone, chairman of the For?

which the embargo resolutions are
pending, said he had opinions on the
nurits of the issue, but thought this
was not the time to discus:? them.
Senator Robinson was the only Sena?
tor who expressed himself os actually
opposed to an embargo, insisting that
it might return to plague the United
Stat?'s in time of conflict with other
nations.
Not Neutral, Says Townsend.
"It is an open secret that we have
not been exactly neutral,*1 aaid Senator
Townsend "We are regarded by many
European countries now as being one
of the Allie.? OS a result of our con?

Senator Works, Republican, and au?
thor of another embargo resolution,
urged the embargo "in the interest of

Minister expressed the hope that

The State Department contends tha
mails on the neutral ships are inwol
able on the high seas, except parce
mail, which is subject to the ordin?r;
laws of contraband. In the case of ves
sels which merely touch at Britisl
ports, the contention is that sealei

because of the regulations requiring all
merchant shipping to report for ex?

no territorial jurisdiction can be ac?
quired in that way and that the mails
en such ships are inviolable.
Very few of the neutral steamers in

British porta voluntarily. The Hritish

THE PRESIDENT AND .MRS. WILSON.
Leaving the Waldorf between speeches for a ride in Central Park.
WILSON'S HINT OF APPROACHING CRISIS
TAKEN AS WARNING TO VON BERNSTORFF
I r a T - frB . ?' Il'irrau.]
Washington, Jan. 27.?The news from New York to-night
that President Wilson had emphasized in his address that he
could not tell "what the international relations of the country
would be to-morrow" was taken here as a direct warning to
Ambassador von Bernstorff. State Department officials to-day
let it be known that the German envoy had been told this wa.
the last chance his country would have to give satisfaction on
the Lusitania issue. The two items of news were read together.
The announcement from the State Department was sim?
ply that von Bernstorff had been informed that President Wil?
son and Secretary Lansing would not receive any more tenta?
tive proposals from the Kaiser. Officials refuse to define the
administration's attitude more exactly or to say what will be
done if Germany evades again. Confidence is expressed, how?
ever, that Germany will accede to the American demands.
This hope is based on the belief that Ambassador von Bern?
storff already has power to satisfy this government, but wishes
to choose a time more opportune for political effect.
In German quarters the same confidence is voiced, but it
is said that the issue is entirely up to Berlin and that Ambas?
sador von Bernstorff has reached the limit of his powers. A
statement of SecretaryLansing's position has been telegraphed
to Berlin, with the recommendation that the demands be ac?
ceded to promptly.

Warning of imminent danger, ap?
peals to patriotism, pleas for non-par?
tisanship, defence of preparedness as
something different from militarism,
and a frank admission of his own con?
version to the cause since the last ses?
sion of Congress these were the weap?
ons which President Wilson chose last
night to open the crucial battle of his
political career.
The address was made before a sym?
pathetic audience, composed of men of
high intelligence and appreciation of
foreign affairs. It was tipped with wit,
keen logic and polished rnetoric; it was
greeted with liberal applause. Yet,
HBSa he had taken his seat, and the
half minute's cheTing was over, one
could not but feel that 'he homage had

AMERICA PUTS
SOME THINGS

POSSIBLE HOSTILE
ACTION FE.ARED
Won't Seek War, but
Won't Try to Avoid It
if Necessity Calls.
President Wilson lagt nicht ex?
pressed his first graft doubts as to
possible foreign complications?com?
plications that he intimated might
come any day. Aloof with this
statement came assertions that
Americans wore ready to fight for
their ideals.
These new views on the part <f
the President ram" in a discussion
of governmental affairs at the an?
nual dinner of the Railway Business
association at the "??'aldorf-AstorU.
So earnest did the President be?
come that he forgot his original
manuscript, departed from his first
plans of less definite discussion, and
repeatedly referred to the possibility
of militant action in defence of the
nation's honor.
? "I cannot tell you what the inter?
national relations of this country
will be to-morrow; and I use the
word literally," ?aid the President.
"And 1 would not dare keep silent
and let the country suppose that to?
morrow was certain to be a3 bright
as to-day. America will never bo
the aggressor; America will always
seek to th?* last p-->int nt wh'ch her
honor is involved to avoid the things
which disturb the peace of the
world. But a-Vmerica does not
control the rimmtMMII ai the
world, and we must be sure that we
are faithful servants of those things
which we love, and are ready to de?
fend them against every contingency
that may affect or impair them."
"There are some things Amcr
I ?cans want more than peace. We
? won't seek war, but we won't try t*
avoid it if it becomes a necessity.
I would rather surrender territory
than those idea's which an? the staff
of life to the American soul.
I The President*! speech in full at ths
Railway Business Association dinner
was as folio .v? :
"The question, it se-ms to m?, w+iieh
most demands claruication just now is
the question to which your t-.a.-tmaster
has referred the question of prepara?
tion for national defence; becaaat, lia?
gularly enough, it has been deeply
clouded by paaaiOH and rrejuliee. It
is very singular that a question tha
elements of which are so .simple and io
obviou? should hav- o.-ei. m l?clouded
by the discussion of men of high mo?
tive, men of purpose as handsome a?
any of us may claim, and yet apparent?
ly incapable of divesting th.mselveg of
that sort of provincialism which con?
sists in thinking the contents of their
own mind to be the contents of tha
mind of th- world. Kor, g> ntlemen,
while America is a very great nation,
while America contain? all the element?
of fine force and accomplishment,
America does not constitu't? the major
part of the world.
"We live in a world which we did
not make, which we cannot aJter, which
cannot think into a different condition
from that which actually exist?. It
would be a hopeless piece of provin?
cialism to suppose tr.at because ?I
think differently from the rest of tha
world we are at liberty to assume that
the rest of the world will permit ua to
enjoy thet though' without duturb
ar.ee.
"It is a ivrpriaiaa; eircanataace al.s

or personal ?ambition to creep into tha
discussion of this fiiridamcn'.il thing.
How can Americans differ about tha
safety of America ?
"I, for my part, am ambitious that
America should do a (mate r ,mA mora
difficult thing than the great nationi
on the other side of the water hav?
done. In all the belligerent countriel
men, without distinction nt party, ha?/?
drawn together to accomplish a suc?
cessful prosecution of the war. Is it
not a more difficult and a more desira?

aartiaaa prapeaaaealae aalde and draw
?.(.?ether for the MCCeeafal prosecu?

for America, and I ktlieve thai Amer?
ica is going to enjoy that distinction.
