in considerable numbers. They gained
aeme ground but failed to hold but a
part of it.
The Russians in Poland and Gallicia
bond to be slowly advancing, but nothing
decisive cornea from that quarter as yet.
The news from the Caucasus is con
flioting. Heavy snows prevent vary
much aotion by either party.
Mesopotamia an English army is be
eeieged while an advanoing English army

battle of six hours.
Aeroplane flights, raids and battles in
the air are becoming more frequent
Balds have been made on the English
coast towns with but little mihtar/ re*
suit but which killed some
citizens. En
tente aviators have been dropping
bombs among German soldiers and de
pots. Germany is credited with having
bailt aeroplanes that will carry twenty
five men and that are armored.
Some submarine work is also going on
but not as frequent as in the beginning
of the war. A peculiar phase of the
••Persia" sinking is the fact that as no
submarine was seen by the crew or pas
aeagefs, there is no way*of fixing the
responsibility for the sinking on any spe
cial nation.
A rumor is to the effect that Spain is
about to join the Teuton allies, with the
apeeial object of taking Giberalter.
Another much talked of alliance for the
Teutons is that of Sweden.. In the tor.
mer case we think it very doubtful if
Spain gets in the war. Her position
is rather too isolated from what would
be her allies. She would practically
have to light alone In the caae Swed
en, there ia much more probability.

MASTERTON, Mgr.
England seems about to make the
blockade of Germany much closer than
formerly. Unless England makes the
blockade actual it is likely that the U.
S. will protfst very vigorously.
Canada now has a larger army in the

CAPITAL REMOVAL.
What wis started almost a9 a ject baa
become a somewhat serious question—
for Bismarck. New Rockford is busy
rocking the foundations of the state
.capiiol.
While to these two cities it is a serious
question, because a political fight over a
I whole state is a very expensive matter,
yet to the average citizen of the state it
is matter of small moment where the
capitol of the commonwealth is situated.
Not one in a hundred of the population
ever has occasion to visit the capital of
the state on business connected with the
stale government and of these few go
more often than once in a lifetime.
So far HS the ordinary citizen is con
cerned the state capital may as well be
in one place as another. As to actual
convenience, as the present population
and lines of travel are situated, Fargo
would probably be better than Bismarck
or New Rockford, just as Si. Paul is the
more accessable point in Minnesota.
As between New (Rockford and Bis.
marck if t.he center of North Dakota is
taken by drawing straight lines from the
four corners, then Bismarck appears to
be about six miles the nearest. Though
of course- as present settled New Rock
ford is nc arer the center of population.
But Fargo will never be the capital
neither will Grand Forks, not because
they are not central, but because of the
rivalry between them. Either could oi
would have been the capital if it had
not been for the other. That was settl
ed years ago, woen the western part of
the state was too weak to have made a
fight again9t either of them.
The question of capital removal de
pends largely on the whims of the dear
people. Given a certain amount of pre
judice against Bismarck and a certain
amouut of supposed benefits by removal
and there is material for a big fight,
provided it is properly financed.
Most state capitals are built for show
more than for utility. Our nearest
neighbors have a building at St. Paul
which is a thing of beauty. Most visit
ors to that city take time to look that
building over and are well repaid. It is
a building to be pioud of.
That North Dakota will eventually
build a fine capitol in which they will
try to rival that at St. Paul is certain.
Just now, however, the question come
shall we build at Bismarck or New
Rockford?
There is one issue involved in the an
swers of which the votersf should think
before they vote. Bismarck already has
building9 that will accommodate the
public business for many years to come.
If the capital is removed then new
building will be needed at once.
Personally, we think the time has
not arrived in this new state to build the
capitol that should be build when it is
built. This state as yet has had all it
could do to keep its present state institu
tions going with its present income. It
has been and is yet an annual problem
for the state government to raise suffici
ent incoine to pay the necessary bills.
Of course the advocates for removal
will aigue that the building of the,new
capitol will cost the state but little or
nothing. Probably, many people will be
lieve this only to know the real truth
later.
Buildings, whether public or private,
in spite of the most careful plans, have
a persistent habit of coating a lot more
than expected.

The annual meeting of the farmers, of
this section haa become a fixture. The
past meetings have been so well attend
ed and have been so auccessful in etaty
particular that to discontinue thiv
would be a step backward. The people
of Pembina and the Commercial Clufe
have agaiu taken it upon themselves tb
act as hosts to the farmers of this sec
tion and have provided a program whjch
it is hoped will surpass in interest and
value anything heretofore given.
The date of the meeting has been set
for Wednesday, February 9, 1916,
and
three representatives of the Fargo Agri
cultural College will take uo most of the
time with discussions of those farm pro
blema which relate particularly to this
section. All subjects ot interest will be
handled in a practical and simple way
and those attending will be benefited
without a doubt.
It is desired that you ask as many
questions as possible and that you make
the most of this meeting in every way.
It is by entering the general discussions
that many points of interest and value
are brought out that might otherwise be
overlooked or forgetten.
There will be a special part of the pro
gram for the ladies and special attention
will be given to subjects which refer
especially to the home. We want a
large attendance of ladies so they may
profit by the helpful hints and ideas
which will be advanced. This part of
the program will be in charge of an tffi
cient lady instructor from the Fargo
Agricultural College.
The full program will be given next
week, and we are sure you will find
something in it that will particularly in
terest you, if you are now trying to solve
some of the problems of farming.
Visiting farmers and their wives will
be supplied with tickets which will be
good for supper at any hotel in the city,
and has' the program will be continued
in the evening and will be especially in
teresting, we want all visitors to stay for
the evening program and be the guests
ol the Commerial Club for supper.
If the past meetings have been of in
terest and value to you, do not fail to
attend this one. Everything is being
done to make it a success, and your at
tendance is all that will be required to
make this tbe most profitable meeting
over held. You are invited. Make it a
success by your presence. Remember
the date, February 9, 1916. It will be
worth while.
OFFICIAL FIGURES.
For tbe benefit of those who either be
lieve ia the Democratic free trade tariff
or those who have not given the subject
any special consideration we submit the
following figures showing the results of
free importation of cattle from foreign
countries. The reason those cattle are
bought in Canada and Mexico is that
the importer and packer can buy them
cheaper than he can from the producer
at home. By looking over your meat
bill see if you are buying your meats
cheaper than you did under the Repub
lican protective tariff or not. If you
don't than it is an eas^ matter to see
who is reaping the benefit. You will re
member thet under the Republican tar
iff there was scarcely a pound of import
ed beef oonsumed in the United States.
The following is tbe report submitted by
Jame's D. Poole, of the Union Stock
Yards of Chicago.
Chicago, Jan. 124.—Western Canada
sent 26,500 oattle to Chicago in 1915,
againat 15,000 the previous year. Mon
tana's contribution was 85,900. During
the first ten months of 1915, whioh is as
far as Washington has compiled returns,
Canada furnished 187,909 of the 443,551
cattle imported by the Uni tedStatus, the
valuation being 98,884,579. Mexico sent
253,810 valued at 95,772^)00. The pre
vious year Canada contributed 143,679,
valued at 96,623,092, and Mexico 455,901,
valued at 97,900,442.
BOYS' SUMMBR ENCAMPMENT.
We are in receipt of a bill introduced
in the Senate by tfon. P. J. McCumber
of this. state which is a step in the
right direction.
The bill is preceded in introduction by
a number of "whereases'' Whioh though,
written in tbe fine diotion for which the
senator ia noted, yet perhaps may all be
condensed into the general statement
that while tbe Amertoau people prefer
the "achievements of peace to thoae of
war" and therefore do net desiie to main
tain a large atanding a,rmy—yet they do
see the necessity of some form and awpt
degree of "preparedness.^

Tfie bill teeitee that there area little
over' 600,000 high school boys in the
United States and that as the encamp
menta would occur in vacation time, and
that many of these boys would be glad
to gtji and train in such an enoampment
and get such-drill and education.
Personally, the writer, thibks favor
ably ot this scheme because we believe
that1 the boy is the proper beginning Of
an army. We further believe that such
encampments would soon be followed by
military training in schools and the en
campments would then become suppli
mentary to the school training.
Nobody wauts war, nobody wants a
atanding army. That is self-apparent.
But nobody wants policemen, or sheriffs,
or courts. They are expensive and if
man would always act as he should there
would be no need of the machinery of
the law. But we know that we must
have-the legal machinery—to keep the
peaces That is why we must have an
army or "the makings"—to keep tbe
peaoe.
Let. us train the boys—not to tight'
but to be able to keep the peace.
