Sonic who hud agreed to sign

lease is as fiilr as anyone could
wish for, and far better than
any lease that has ever been

are that after the drilling is

across, and if oil is developed
they will lie more anxious than

It is hardly possible that uny

Williams his assistant in the

ten buckets, a twelve foot ludder,'
tlfty grain sacks, live axes and
live shovels to be used in ease of

The troop, with the exception of
ten men who will bu left as a
guard, will bu marched at the
double time to tho fire, taking
with them tho tiro buckets, axes,
ladder, sacks and shovels.
There is so much difference in
the movement of the soldiers and
the average civilian In going to
tire that the soldiers will general
ly have it putout before anybody
arrives if they have the water.
It would be impossible for a
town of this si.e to have a volun
teer tire department that would
favorably compare in efficiency
witii a body of trained soldiers.
If weliave a good supply of wa
ter at all times we cau have the
best tire protection of uny town
in the suite, but it is impossible
lor the soldiers, well trained as
they are, to tight tire without
water.
Of course their 'preparedness'
is principally for their protce,

just us quickly if the lire is not

can do something if they have

M. Editor: We road what
you and Mrs. Close had to say In
the columns of your Invaluable
paper last week. We think it.
perfectly in order though should
have been suggested a year or
two ago. Mrs. Close as has
been suggested is compelled to
do some thinking. If she hud
the moneyshe would prove her
self right. She is more than
taking care of a family, while
others, who are failuros would
discourage, rather than Incotir
ngc or help her. It reminds tis
c.f Columbus of old. Aftur he
had conceived and taken chances
of telling of his theory of the
rotundity of tho earth, ( as you
know during the Dark ages
people were tortured and put to
death for less erroneous theo
ries), lie had the linger of scorn
pointed at him by the children
on the street, so history tells us,
which wits of course permitted
if not encouraged by the older
people. He begged, if not for
food, for aid to prove his theory
correct. Well there is more
about this story that Is interest
ing. After applying to the tnon
archs of England and Portugal
and elsewhere in vain; after al
most giving up in despair he
was assisted by Isabella, Queen
of Spain. Yes a woman came to
his rescue, getting the neces
sary funds by pawning her jew
els wc are told. We may have
to resort to getting encourage
ment and money in this canning
factory prox)sition from tho
women. There is no dolusiun
about this proM)sition. Our
citizens know we can suport it
canning factory, by tomatoes
only. We have all seen, and
eaten the finest tomatoes of out
lives that were grown right here
In the Miinbres Valley You've
raised them yourselves. Your
father, mother, grand parents,
in Texas, Missouri, nor any
where else ever beat this valley
Remember the tomatoes that
have tteen marketed hero at '2u
K'V ound. Think of the toma
toes that have been on exhibit
here in town . Of the measure
moots and weights of different
individual tomatoes. Uo you
remember the vine that Mr.
Dixuu brought to town and by
the aid of two other men and a
blouk and tackle was raised to
tho ceiling of one of the raid
estate offices. There were estl
mates ol from 300 to .1000 touia
toes on the vine after nearly half
hint hcu.1 lost in handling. Of
course they were of a small
variety. If of an ordinary size
there would have been several
hundred pounds on the vine
Wo must help the farmer and
thereby help ooursulvus, If farm
ing or not. With the nuar by
and other markets why allow
our farmers to give up such a
wonderful industry as the touia
to business would be in this
valley if we could can thora bo
fore snipping. To lie you
can l has been the Knoukors
pass word for ugos. This re
minds me of Hlairs poem of a
fow years ago, "Twenty Years
To Come. " It will come. It is
coming. We have the bank, tele
phone, electric lights and many
other things that l.e predicted

656 Deer Killed In 1915
Reports submitted by forest
officers In charge of tho National
Forests of New Mexico show a
total of (ir0 deer, 582 turkeys,
47 bear, 445 cayotes, 57 wolves
and 10 lions as killed by hunters
during the season of 1015. These
eports do not pretend to be
mathemati'utlly accurate, but are
careful estimates based on close
observations by the forest rang
ers, and give a good general in
dex to hunting conditions.
Forest officers point out that
tho number of deer killed in New
Mexico was only half the number
killed last year, and attribute
his to the growing scarcity of
the supply. Many of them con
sider a live year closed season
necessary to restore door hunt
tig to the normal basis.
Conditions are said to be es
pecially deplorable in the Carson
forest in northern New Mexico,
where on a million acres of .fine
deer range, deer are so scarce
that only 8 were Killed.
The Albuquerque Game Pro
tectivc association in comment
ing on these figures state that
unless tho people of Now Mox
Ico give their prompt support
to the Chamberlain- Huydc
Game Refuge bill now before
congress, thus insuring th
prompt creation of a system of
game refuges, that a long losed
season is the only remaining
alternative for saving tho deer
from virtual extinction. In short.
it is said that tho situation spells
either game refuges or no hunt
lug.
