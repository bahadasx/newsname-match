The British labor congrt

Walter Runciman. preside

fuel, mun'tions and other ess

Considerable fighting has b<
taking place along the ent

that between 500 and 600 ya
of French trenches were stoi

of Neuville and that Frei
counter attacks were without

British report the progress

the north of the Aisne have b(
badly hammered by the Frer

forest.
While considerable fighti
has been going on along the R

The British report that t
Turks have evacuated th

Kut-el-Amara defenses to ab<

I OUTLINES WORK OF
t TARIFF HOARD
1 To Deal With Unfair Methods of
, Competition Between This
j and Other Nations.
? Washington, Jan. 27.?Presi1
dent Wilson has sent a letter to
* | Chairman Kitchin, of the house
t ways and means committee, exs
plaining why he had withdrawn
his opposition to a tarff commis*
3ion and now was urging the
creation of such a body by con3
gress. He wrote frankly that he
e had changed his mind because
'? "all the circumstances of the
world had changed."
e; Declaring that he had "no
s j thought whatever of a change in
R | attitude toward, the so-called
^ j protection question," the presij
dent said the proposed commis'|sion
would have nothing to do
"| with theories of policy, but
would be charged only with the
1 duty of seeking facts to guide
" congress in legislation. In an"
other letter to Mr. Kitchin Mon1
day he set forth fully his ideas
' of what a tariff commission
should be, and urged that the
| ways and means committee cor.;
I sider the matter immediately.
He favored a wholly non-part i,,
san, expert organizfaion.
"I have changed my mind.1
said the letter, "because all the
circumstances of the world have
[i changed, and it seems to me that
- in view of the extraordinary ard
i far-reaching changes which the
0 European war has brought abmit
r it is absolutely necessary that
II we should have a competent ine
strument of industry along the
1 whole line of the many questions
1 which affect our foreign com
t nierce. * * *
"I dare say you feel as I do.
| that it would be folly at this
i, | time, or until all the altered
f! changes are clearly understood,
ti I to attempt to deal with quess
I tions of foreign commerce by
- legislation, and yet having dealt
s! directly and clearly with the
whole question of unfair compej
tit ion within our own borders, it
t is clear that as soon as we know
0 the facts we ought to deal with
1 unfair methods of competition
i as between our nation and ofhVjers,
and this is only one of the
many things, that we would prob
ably wish to deal with. * * *
"You will remember that in
, my last message to congress !
foreshadowed just the considerations
which were operating in
my mind in this matter. The
passage to which I refer was
i this:
i ! " 'Many conditions about which
. we have repeatedly legislated
1! are being altered from decade to
. | decade, it is evident, under our
. very eyes, and are likely to
t change even more rapidly and
1 more radically in the days irntne_
diately ahead of us, when peace
si has returned to the world. * ""
? .Just what these changes will be
5 no one more certainly can forsee
t or confidently predict. * * * The
- most we can do is to make certain
that we have the necessary
instrumentalities of information
{ constantly at our service so that
> we may be sure that we know
exactly what we are dealing with
j when we come to act, if it should
be necessary to act at all.' : * *
"Congress has so much to do
. at the present time that it is
5 clearly impossible that it should

Monday the president said:

Special Letter Notifying Him

AGGRESSIVE CAMPAIGN
Will Lend His Energetic Support
For Adequate Preparedness.
Col. Leroy Springs has been
appointed to the membership
committee of the Navy league
of the United States and will
help to represent that organization
in this district in the active,
aggressive campaign which
it is carrying on in all parts of
the country in behalf of adequate
preparedness against invasion
and disaster. He will
co-operate with the members

for South Carolina, of
which Mr. J. P. Bryan, of Charleston,

will lend his energetic and enthusiastic
support to the work

of adequate preparedness.
A special letter has been received
by Col. Springs from the
Navy league, notifying him 01
his appointment.
The Navy league is not in anv

Since its foundation more than
fourteen years ago it has been
, foremost in the work for international
peace.
The Navy league holds that
this country's best defense lies

miles of water which separate
it from the nearest of its pow.

by armies on American soil, but
' by trained fighting men in
i ships, far out on the ocean
! where destruction of life am
property will bo kept to a mini.
mum. and the savage business
of killing will bo kept as far apossible
from America's home.,

j He outlined in detail his plana
for the work of such a board, including
the collection of tariff
figures, investigation of the output
of products at home and
abroad of the workings of commercial
treaties and preferential

of competition, of "dumping"
and of scientific methods of
creating new industries and

LEGISLATORS
Opposes Members of General Assembly
Becoming Trustees
of State Colleges.
Columbia, Jan. 27.?The question
of whether a college trusteeship
is an office within the meaning
of the constitution came
squarely before the senate Wednesday,
when the house bill proposing
to submit to the people
an amendment to the constitution
adding to the constitutional
exceptions of the inhibition
against two-office-holding, trustee
of a state institution or regent
of a school. The senate
I voted down the bill after rejecting
several amendments, and after
an extended debate.
Senator Laney proposed an
amendment to permit members
of the general assembly to hold
the office of a state college.
Senator Banks attacked this
amendment as a dangerous tendency
towards concentration of
power.
The amendment was rejected
by a vot eof 17 to 24.
The question of biennial sessions
of the general assembly
would be submitted to the people,
according to a proposed constitutional
amendment introduced
by Senator Mullins. The proposition
received a favorable rennrt
fvnm
~ ..ww me juuiciary committee.
The bill creating the 14th judicial
circuit out of the counties
of Jasper, Beaufort. Hampton
and Colleton, and leaving the
county of Charleston alone in
the ninth circuit, was received
in the senate from the house and
referred to the judiciary committee.

of \V. W. Long.
Clomson College. Jan. 27.?
Xhe farm demonstration agents
of South Carolina are in annual
session under the leadership of
W. \V. Long. Forty or more
agents are here, representing
practically every county in the
state! Sessions are held morning.
afternoon and evening, and
exceedingly helpful discussions
are held on vital topics. The
meeting was opened with prayer
l\v Mr. Lott. after which an address
was made by President W
M. Riggs. Tn the course of his
very pertinent remarks, Dr.
Riggs stated that the demonstration
agents were doing n
work worth more to South Carolina
than that done by any other
organization in the state. Ho
stressed the importance of per'oualiiy
in the agent, and warned
the men not to allow criticism
of any sort to swerve them from
their work. He praised the missionary
snirit that kept the men

Among the demonstrators
there are many Clemson men.
This fact is of course gratifying
to the college. One can not
help wondering at the possibilities
for good in the seemingly con
sec-rated services of these young
and enthusiastic men. Their
work has helped greatly during
the hard times through which
the state has been coming. The
loyalty ot 4he men to their untiring
leader, W. \V. Long, is remarkable.
