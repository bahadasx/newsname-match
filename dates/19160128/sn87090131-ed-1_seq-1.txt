THE BEST PLACE.
The mountain top is small. There
is hardly room enough there for the sa;
few who reach its height; and, unless to(
those who do keep a firm foothold, a
they may be pushed off and dashed
to pieces. ciE
The way to the mountain top is sp
steep and rugged, the rocks are slip- thi
pery, and the path is full of landslides. en
The valley is broad and fertile, and sa
there is room enough there for plant- Qu
ing and for harvesting. so
The ordinary man can earn his liv- wt
ing in the valley; the extraordinary ba
man may be able to attach himself fui
i
to the mountain top. in
I am not asking you: young man,
not to travel upward, nor am I sug
gesting that you forever remain on the or
plains; but I am attempting to pic- le
ture the dangers of steep climbing, ca
and the liability of not being able to
find a foothold at the top.
Better, far better, be a good tiller
of the soil down in the green valley
than starve among the mountain's fu
rocks.
In these days of strenuous busi
ness, of liberal education, and of op- e
portunity, the old adage that "there
is always room at the top" is not as
true as it used to be, for. even though
there may be room at the very top.
one must take fearful chances in gl
climbing, and he will meet strenuous e
men en route, ready and anxious to a
win, not only by advancing them- m
selves, but by pushing others down. et
The tendency to go beyond one's pl
ability, to occupy positions unnatural w
and difficult to hold, is responsible for
many a failure, and has ruined many m
men who would have been successful d
had they been contented and indus- ei
trious, with good prospect of prosper
ity.
Ambition should be made of sterner o
stuff than that which drives a man out c
of himself into unknown regions, or
into places too high for him to gain a
foothold, a footing which, even if he a
does gain it, he may be unable to t
keep.
It is your duty to do your best, to
make the most of yourself, to encour
age rather than to cramp mmbition, w
to use common sense in the making 01
of yourself, that brand of good sense
which does not allow you to stay be- t
low your level and which will prevent 0o
you from striving to go beyond it. o'
Thousands of men move from where t
they are, dissatisfied and disgruntled, ti
and enter new and unknown fields, 1
when, if they had remained at home,
making the best of their opportunit
ties, they would have been worth y
more to themselves and to the world. 1
Where you are, unless it is below P
the surface, may be the best place in
which for you to work and to stay.
Certainly, you should not allow your- t'
self to leave your base of operations I
until you are sure that where you are '
is not the place for you to be in, and
until you know of a location within a
the probable scope of your capacity. e
Beware of the top, unless there is c
a safe road leading to itn
Fighters Who Never See a Battle.,
During a sea fight the engine-room
men tend the great engines of a battle
ship with all the care that they would
bestow upon the same delicate yet
mighty mechanism in time of peace,
roaming listlessly, yet with a definite
purpose, around the engine room with
oil cans in hand, bestowing drops of
lubricant here and there as required. i
Theirs and the stokers' is almost-not c
quite-the hardest part of the whole c
grim drama of a naval battle, for they
are absolutely cut off from the fight,
and are only cognizant of it by the
quivering of their ship as the great
turrets over their heads fire, or as
the enemy's shells thud against the 1
armor, or when some stray shot finds i
its way through the stell wall and the I
bunkers to the boilers. Such an event
blends a whole stokehold in one fren- t
zied orgy of death-death by explod- i
ing shell and scattering fragments of
steel; death by awful wounds from I
flying. burning coals, or death by
scalding, hissing, blinding steam as
the water tubes burst all around them. i
Boy Critics.
For many years the boys of Trinity
college, Dublin, made and unmade the
reputation of operatic stars. They al
ways sat in the highest gallery, and
were recognized as the real critics 1
of an opera. "I1 remember." says liar
ton McGuckin, the well-known English
tenor. ''there was a fellow. Thomasa
or some such name, whose career was
blasted by a witty gallery boy.
i Thomasi was anything but graceful.
He had but tne gesture, which con
sisted in bringing first one, then the
Sother hand to his heart and letting it
fly back straight before him. It was
very much like the sort of motion a
man would make iL deep water. He
sang an Itali- love song, working his
arms as described. When he finished
a voice from the gallery broke the st
lence: "Ah. Misther Toomasi. you
ain t mooch of a singer, but I'11 wager
ye'd make a foine swimmer." The au
dience screamed with delight Thom
asi had to leave the stage.

SOCIETY.
"I am not in society this winter."
says a young society woman. "I am
too busy to go into society," remarks
a young man.
Wh is "society" mn way, the so
clety about which the foregoing was
spoken? Really. I don't know, and
the three big dictionaries refuse to
enlighten me. At a guess, I should
say that probably the young people
quoted refer to the collection of per
sons they meet when they go out.
when they are away from home, at
balls, parties, and other invitation
functions, and not necessarily to the
individuals whom they visit. Perhaps
they are unfortunate enough to be
long to some alleged exclusive form
or society, or to some clique or col
lection of conceited people, who, be
.cause they don't know where they
stand, assume to stand for something
about which they know nothing.
Thousands, yes, hundreds of thou
sands, of young people have injured
their presents and discounted their
futures by going into what they call
"society." Yes, many men and wom
en have sacrificed their souls upon
the altar of "society."
Young people should have friends,
they should not be bookworms or
room hermits. They should intermin
gle. they should exchange experi
ences, play games of conversation,
and other games; but all this does not
mean "going into society," for "soci
ety" is commonly understood as sim
ply another word for excess, with or
without the winecup.
It is a significant fact that our great
merchant princes, our men of prodi
gious intellect, our famous discover
ers and scientists, our men of mark
in every walk of life, care more for
sociability than for society, and not
one in a hundred of them is in "so
ciety." They live natural lives, make
friends among their kind, and enjoy
social intercourse. They don't "care
a fig" whether Mrs. Tone invites them
to her most exclusive ball, or whether
Mr. Highbrow includes them in his
list of dinner guests.
Many men of wealth, and more men
who haven't any. sacrifice the vitality
of life to get irno "society," and when
they get in they spend half of their
time keeping in. When they become
old enough to know better, they go
out into Nature's out-of-doors, breathe
the fresh air. and mentally, and some
times physically, kick themselves for
the folly of their silly ambition.
Don't worry about finding your "so
ciety" level. Your level will come to
you, and any level you try to reach,
which is either above or below your
proper sphere, is disastrous
Bear in mind, young man and young
woman, that mere money, the ability
to dance the tango, and the capacity
for small talk, are not keys which
will unlock the door of gooo society.
If your ancestors came here in the
overcrowded Mayflower. or your sev
eral times removed grandfather
chased Indians, remember that you
may not be any better than other peo
ple with a hazy past, for the whole
world feeds on the same kind of meat,
sleeps in similar beds and wears
much-alike clothes, if it can get them.
"Society," as it runs, starts from
nowhere and ends in the Land of
Nothing.
Good Manager.
A bare-headed woman with a faded
and ragged dress solicited alms the
other evening of a gentleman who was
crossing the City park. He came to a
halt and asked:
"'Is it for drink"'
"No, sir; it's for food."
"But I don't know how you live. I
I have to practice economy in order to
Shave money in my pocket. You may
Sbe extravagcnt, for all I know. How
Smuch money have you spent today"
t "Well. sir, I've spent seven cents
