entire Balkan peninsula as far
as
Greece will be complete.
The allies, however, are deter-,
mined to hold Avlona as they have
held Salontkl, Greece, Inasmuch as Its
strategic positions are of great value.
They hope to retain that Immediate
vicinity as bases from which future
camnalirn for re-conquerlng the Bal -

Gale Off the California Coast
Wrecks Steam Vessel Ab
erdeen, and All Members of
Crew Are Believed Lest
San Francisco, Jan. 28. Caught lit
a sea churned to furious heights by
90-mile gale, the steam schooner
Aberdeen dashed to splinters early
today on the jagged rocks near Point
Bonita beyond the heads, and eight
men aboard her are believed to have
perished.
Timbers crushed to a pulp, the
broken stump of a main mast and
pieces of the bow and stern of the
vessel crashed up under the bluffs of
the point in the murky dawn. But
there was no sign, of her lifeboats,
except the broken splinters.
Life-saving patrols, who . had
braved the wintry night, felt certain.
the eight men aboard could not have
escaped except toy a virtual miracle.
The one chance in a thousand, they
said, was that lifeboats had put over
and gone ont to sea before the wares
crumpled the ship on the rocks, or
that some other storm-tossed shin
had picked them up. The men be
lieved dead are: .
Captain Peter Knudsen, R, J.
Moore, Edward Johnson, R. J. John
son, Louis Decuttonl, Edward Smith,
and two unidentified sailors.
The Aberdeen formerly In the
Seattle fishing trade, bad been used
as the garbage vessel for the city of
Oakland. Twice a week she steamed
out to the open sea to dump her cargo
of refuse. Aboard her ,, when ..( she
started out of port in the face of
storm warnings was Inspector Moore,
in addition to the regular crew:
As the night wore on, the vessel
had reached a spot where she was in
the very center of the storm mael
strom. That she battled against the
roaring winds to make port is prob
able. But she was too small to win
against , the gale. . '
The first word of the wreck came
in a message to Captain Nelson, com
mander at the Golden Gate coast
guard station.
In Oakland a tearful woman heard
the story of the wreck hysterically.
She was Moore's wife. t j ;
"Oh, I warned him not to go out
In the storm," she moaned. "I was
afraid of the sea."
All days she besieged Oakland offi
cials for news of the men aboard
but there was none. r ,
The ill-fated vessel was owned by
Captain Llnderman.'of Oakland, who
leased it to the city.
