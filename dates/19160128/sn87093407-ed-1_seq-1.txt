PROSECUTOR DECLARES
MAYOR LIED, STAR MAN
INVESTIGATES 'DISTRICT'
Lundin Inclined to Blame Police for Exist
ence of Alleged "Ring"; Mayor Reiterates
His Orders That Policemen Shall Not Be
Permitted to Enter Houses at Will; Will
Not Dismiss Officer
I went to see Prosecutor Lundin Thursday afternoon re
garding a statement made by the mayor.
fiill said the police department had furnished the prose
cutor with all records of arrests and convictions made in what
has become known the Dearborn st district, with the idea
that Lundin would abate those places. Then Lundin, the
mayor said, wouldn't act.
It came out at the trial of Policeman Edward J. Margett
that a called restricted district ha> existed for some time
in the neighborhood near Dearborn st. and Mavnard avc.,
and that it still exists.
Whether it docs actually exist. anil if -o. why, was wha?
1 determined to find out.
It does.
A short foray into the district assured me of that.
The managing editor has forbidden local color, but i
make so bold as to >-a> that several women solicited me from
window* and doorways.
r\*. m • m /> • r t ni v
Dtstrict Comprises Several Blocks I
And the district isn't restricted to two blocks, as was j
testified at the Margett trial, either.
It is a »ort of unrestricted restricted district. I should
say. comprising several blocks. Not all the houses arc of a
disorderly character, but most of them arc.
Having established that fact, I went, as I have said, |
Lundin.
l.tindin asserted: hH
"There is a great vice syndicate in Seattle, well organize! VI
and well protected!" :"vra|
The prosecutor backed himself against the wall in Deputy *
Lane Summers' office and regarded me with narrowed eyes. J
His fighting blood was up, apparently.
"\V hen members are arrested, the >ame bondsmen always **<
appear with money for their release. The same attorney .1
serves them all."
lie shook his big forefinger.
Shows Him Evidence Turned Over by Lang
"And the police tell me they are afraid to act under tiie
present orders of Mavor < rill. Thev're afraid he'll fire them
off the force. IF THE MAYOR' SAYS 1 WON'T ACT
WHEN THE POLICE GIVE ME EVIDENCE SUFI-1- J
CIENT TO RED-LIGHT A HOUSE. HE LIES,"
I asked why, if the police department had reported mat-VCI
ters, Lundin had failed to carry out his duty.
Deputy I,ane Summers, who is in charge of all red-light
cases, showed me the reports sent him by Chief 1-ang.
Chief I-anp is not a lawyer. Possibly that is the reason
why he did not furnish data sufficient to warrant red-light
prosecutions against the half a hundred houses he did report
Rut the records are not sufficiently complete to even sug- i
Rest a conviction, the prosecutor says.
Some convictions have been obtained, however, under tin
red-light law. Two houses were ordered torn down u:>U
several others were closed.
I.undin is positive of the existence of the vice syndicate
and is just as positive that it could not exist if the poli.-•
were not under certain orders which, he says, he is told,
are direct front Mayor (till.
Says Policemen Fear for Their Jobs
"No arrests or raids may l>e made without warrants."
said I.undin. "That is one of the mayor's orders. There
is no authority in law for such an order. On the contrarv,
there is authority, vested in every peace officer, to arrest va
grants, which include the class of women in houses in tl. v *
Dearborn st. district, without warrants.
"Yet, the police tell me, if they bring in such a prisoner
without having fir*t secured a warrant, they will lose thei.-
jobs."
At the mayor's office. Hi Gill himself explained to me
the order in question.
''That order has been in force ever Mnce I took office."
he --aid, emphatically, "AND IT'S GOING TO STAY IN
FORCE.
''I don't stand for my men breaking in doors and smash
ing up houses unless there i< some reason tor it. There's no
law that says they can do that.
"As far as the Dearborn neighborhood is concerned,
there have been more arrests down there than in any other
part of town. It isn't protected and never has been while
I have been mayor." ,
So there you are!
