More Snow Today
The local weather advises that with
the snow yesterday, we will have
snow today also. He fails to mention
an thing about a possible let up of the
deluge. It J3 raining south as usual
with storms in California.
BROWN LAID TO
IMPRESSIVE CEREMONIES
AW, GO GET THE SHOVEL
&
Just as another testimonial of
the weather man's high regard
and especial estw-m, a matter of
about fifteen inrhes of snow or
1.13 inches of water was precipi
tated upon the joyous people
Tuesday and Wednesday night.
The easy with which the pre
cipitation descends leads one to
believe that no one has thrown c
a monkey wrench into the mach
inery of the law of gravitation.
The forecast until Thursday at
0 p. m. is "rain to night or '
Thursday south portion; snow '
north portion, colder tonight.
Cold wave north portion of
state."
Of course this weather forecast '
will stop at 0 o'clock p. m.
promptly, but the weather bu-
reau isn't locked and will com-
mence over again before their
limit is up.
The Reclamation service has
worried about our watershed and
cutting trees up in this section
for a number of years. This year
should convince them conclusive-
ly that our old "shed" is in good
working order and still has
Roosevelt dam fulls to spare.
In spite of all scientific theor-
ies water still refuses to run up

MBS. JANE NEWMAN
A PIONEER OF THIS
STATE PASSES AWAY
She Lied in Arizona for Many Years,
and Was Well Known
Mrs. Jane Newman, known to thou
sands over the state of Arizona as
"Grandma Newman," died Saturday
evening at 10 o'clock at her Phoenix
home, corner of Seventh street and
Clarendon avenue.
Mrs. Newman was one of the grand
old characters of the west. She has
been closely identified with the growth
and expansion of Arizona for a gener
ation. She was born in Missouri in 1840.
Her maiden name was Jane Bennett.
In 1859 she started across the plains
with her parents. They drove an ox
team containing all the family pos
sessions. On the way across the
plains the caravan with which she
and her parents were traveling fell in
with another outfit traveling in the
same direction. With this caravan
was Mr. Newman. They saw a great
deal of each other on the slow, tiro
faome journey, and on their arrival in
California were married.
In 18CC, with her husband and fam
ily, she moved to Oregon, again mak
ing the long trip overland with stock
as he means of locomotion. In Ore
gon they lived in what was called
John Day's valley. They left the val
ley in 1877 and traveled overland to
Prescott.
With them on this trip they brought
horses, cows and ckickens. The de
scendants of these animals can still
be traced throughout the northern
part of Arizona. The chickens which
they brought were among the first of
their kind in that part of the state.
In 1878 they moved to Camp Verde,
where Mr. Newman died that year.
Not daunted by the loss of her hus
band, Mrs. Newman started in to
raise her family of six. By close ap
plication and a keen business insight,
she succeeded in keeping her flock
together and giving them all an edu
cation. She is survived by six sons and
three daughters. Their names are H.
L. Newman, of Redwod, Calif.; J. D.
Newman, of Los Angeles; Mrs. J. D.
Houck, of Cave Creek; R. L. New
man, of Holbrook, sheriff of Navajo
county; Mrs. Frank Leslie, of Flag
staff; Mrs. B. F. Taylor, of Camp
pVerde; W. W. Newman, of Holbrook;
E. B. Newman, of Holbrook, and G.
S. Newman of Holbrook.
Mrs. Newman has for many years
made, her home in Flagstaff and vi
cinity. Each winter she was in the
habit of coming to Phoenix to escape
the rigors of the intense cold there.
Phoenix Republican.
Grandma Newman's death caused
much sorow among the older resi
dents of Flagstaff where she has been
known and loved for so many years.
The family has the sympathy of the
entire community in the loss of the
loved one.
The funeral of Mrs. Jane Newman
took place at her home on North
Seventh street and Clarendon avenue
Wednesday afternoon at 2 o'clock. The
remains will be taken to Flagstaff
later for burial.
BOOZE IBOTTLES BUSTED
BY SHERIFF AT
As a result of the story, appearing
exclusively in last week's issue of Our
Mineral Wealth, that Sheriff Jack
Lane would destroy 900 quarts of con
fiscated whiskey by breaking the bot
tles on the courthouse retaining wall,
a large number of people gathered
last Sunday morning to witness the
"ceremonies."
While the sheriff and his deputies
were at work creating a river of
booze, the congregations of the near
by churches, coming from their morn
ing devotions, stopped to view the
work of destruction. Murmurs- of
satisfaction arose as bottle after bot
tle was smashed upon the wall. Others
were there whose satisfaction was not
so great.
"They call that law enforcement,
but I term it a crime," one individual,
whose nose was suspiciously red, was
heard to grumble as he watched the
pool of John Barleycorn slowly widen
ing. It was a glad day for the prohibi
tionists and a sad one for their oppo
nents as some 15,000 "drinks" trickled
away beyond recovery. Kingman

Hart are at the big live stock at" El
Paso this week.
JUDGE HARRINGTON POLITE
BUT SOMEWHAT INSISTANf
The game of "hide 'n seek" carried
on between the officers and bootleg
gers is an exciting one and just as
good sport as hunting humming birds
with a 22 rifle or fighting bumble
bees in your summer pajamas with
tooth pick for a paddle. The state
"revenooers" may get onto a hot trail
then run into a cake of ice, for the
ways of high-bootin' arc devious, cir
cuitions as well as somewhat circum
jacent, as it were. In other words
"the flea stingeth when no man per
sueth," but not often.
News was received of a bundle of
bedding that would arrive in Flagstaff
Saturday night chaperoned by Tom
Whitson. It was rumored that this
bed contained contrabands of war and
was from Needles. At a west end
street the bundle was dumped .out of
a toilet room window and Whitson
was arrested a short time later by the
sheriff's office. Two or three bottles
were found under a scat, and by a
misunderstanding over the phone, the
dump out was reported to have been
made four or five miles up the track.
In the meantime the "dump" had been
taken care of except that portion that
refused to take the "dump" as a
friendly act and broke out.
Whitson was arrested, but there
was insufficient evidence to prove that
he had "introudced" and was acquaint
ed with the 'dumped bundle in ques
tion. Judge J. O. Soloman Harring
ton, however, decided that, if he, the
said Whitson would agree to partici
pate in the utilization of some other
atmosphere and environment, not
abutting or adjacent to this particular
vicinity, the Judge would agree with
said Whitson would agree to partici-
ly misunderstood and Whitson's "in
troduction," otherwise ho would of ne
cessity be compelled to restrain his
activities either by bars or bond.
Since the weather has been somewhat
, disagreablc here lately anyhow, Whit
son agreed with the Judge in accept
ing a change of climate.
Artist Swinucrton Returns
James Swinnerton, the famous artist-humorist
who creates not only the
"Little Jimmie" funny pictures, but
also a Tom Brown occasionally, re
turned from Chicago Sunday morning,
where he has been for the past month.
The report that he went to Chicago
to avoid Tom Brown until he got over
his "mad" isn't true. As a matter of
fact he only stopped at Chicago to
keep from going to New York.
Charles Murray for City Marshal
Charles Murray announces his can
didacy in this issue of The Sun for
the office of City Marshal and will
be an active candidate for that posi
tion. Mr. Murray is at present de
puty sheriff and jailer and a young
man who is thoroughly equipped for
the duties of that office. His expe
rience during the past year or more
in the sheriff's office, his knowledge of
local conditions and his natural ability
in stopping things before they start
will stand him in good stead in per
forming the duties of that important
local office. He has lived in Flagstaff
a greater part of his life, knows the
people and conditions. He has no dis
position to "pursue enemies and over
look friends" a square deal will be
his one best effort in looking after the
duties of the office.
FLAGSTAFF MEN HAVE BIB
INTERESTS AT OATMAN
The most important mining deal of
the week was the entry of the Oat
man Amalgamated into the limelight.
At the election of officers held in Oat
man last Monday, the following offi
cers were elected: George W. Long,
president; Charles Prochnow of Flag
staff, vice-president; John "L. Mclver,
treasurer and J. T. Burns, secretary
and general manager. Additional di
rectors are George Babbitt, William
Roden of Flagstaff and D. A. Byrno cf
Williams and Del Shercr of Oatman.
The Amalgamated consists of 31
claims and fractions an estate of 429
acres all purchased outright by the
company.
The estate lies 'just north of Silver
Creek, directly in the strike of the
Gold Ore, Gold Roads, United East
ern, Oatman Mining and Tom Reed
veins, being to the east and south.
Also in the strike of the Gaddis, Per
ry and Hardy veins to the west.
A 40 h. p. hoist will be installed at
once and the management hopes to
reach the 500-foot level within four
months time. In all probability no
crosscutting will be done until that
depth is reached. At that point the
ground will be thoroughly explored.

CITY LINES UP FOR STREET PAVING
TWO NEW COONCffl APPOINTED
Resolutions of Intention to Pave Streets and'for
More Cement Walks Passed Judge Doe -To
Supervise Legal Procedure.
HEART TO HEART TALK
WITH SUN SUBSCRIBERS
While every effort is made to
' prevent mistakes on our mailing
list to subscribers, they will hap-
pen. We have, more changes of
adrcsscs than the average week-
ly, but endeavor to the best of
our ability to see that every sub-
scribcr gets his paper at the pro-
per address. It takes only a
small slip to put our list out of
gear in some cases, and post
card will correct the fault. We
would be glad to get the post
card. If you want the address
changed, tell where the paper is
going and where you wish it
changed to. :
Often the Sun goes to an ad- :
dress for months before we dis- :
cover that the subscriber is not '
getting it. In such cases the :
postmaster is to blame.
Again we are notified by post- :
master by card "gone, no ad-
dress," which makes it a hard
game to connect up with the sub-
1 scriber again. 5
Some tell the postmaster to
1 forward their mail but forward-
ing means only letters, papers
must be paid for again before
they can be forwarded. The ad-
drcs3 could be changed, if the
1 subscriber would notify The Sun
office and the paper sent with-
out extra cost.
The postmaster will not for-
ward your papers without you '
send him stamps to do it with.
We want subscribers to get the
paper. We want to stop it when v
you do not want it. '
A little information from the '
subscriber will help us very
much in correcting errors that
occur along this line. '
Subscriptions expire all through
the year, but we send out bills
at the first of the year, which
oftet discloses many discripan- '
cies in Uddresses all of which we
arc pleased to promptly correct, v
ELKS MAKING BIG MOVE
FOB NEW OPERA HOOSE
The Elks arc making a concentrat
ed effort to raise sufficient funds to
build an Elks' home and opera house
this spring. They now own the lots
in a good location on the corner of
Aspen avenue and Beaver street and
have a few thousand in the bank.
A committee was recently appointed
for the purpose of gathering up dona
tions and have succeeded so far in
securing many liberal donations to
ward the new building. Plans and
specifications for the new home build
ing have been studied carefully, but
no definite decision has been made as
to just the amount that can be ex
pended on the project, but sufficient
funds will be accounted for before
the building is started.'
The efforts of the committee so far
have been exceedingly flattering and
if they keep up their present pro
gress long, the new building will be
a certainty. The building will cost
in the neighborhood, of $25,000 or
$30,000 when completed and fitted up
for use.
Cliffs Postofiice to Close
Postmaster J. L. Byrns has received
notice from the postmaster general
advising nim that the postofiice at
Cliffs will be discontinued after Janu
ary 31st. There is no reason given
by the postmaster general why the
office is to be discontinued, but it is
understand that no one cared to be
bothered with it for the amount of
money it paid. It is reported that
the salary amounted to only about $G0
per year though a great deal of mail
was received at that point.
Canaliform Rifts on Mars
The astronomers at the Lowell Ob
servatory have detected canaliform
rifts in the north polar cap of Mars,
five in all. The observed position in
dicates that the most conspicuous one
of these lies along the course of the
known canal Cadmus. The rifts show
the melting effects of vegetation
through the snow.
Rev. A B. Chinn was a visitor in
Winslow yesterday.
The city council held an important
special meeting at the city hall last
Thursday night at which much im
portant business was transacted in a
very short time.
The resignation of councilman Char
les Prochnow was read and accepted
by the council.
The vacancies on the council caused
by the resignations of Mr. Prochnow
and W. A. Campbell were filled by the
unanimous selection of Captain E. M.
Robisop and Mr. O. H. John. Both
are capable energetic business men
who are heartily in accord with the
improvement of the city and their
knowledge and ability wil be a valu
able aid in the public improvement

drafting and preparing the required
resolutions of intentions for the pav
ing of the original district No. 1,
which includes practically all of the
down town district, also resolutions of
intentions for cement walks covering
a large area of the residence district.
These resolutions had been prepared
and by vote of the council it was de
cided to secure the services of Judge
Doe to pass upon the legality of the
steps taken under the new law. Judge
Doe accepted the proposition made
him by the city and will act in the
capacity of an especial advisor in the
legal phases of the proceedings.
No decision has been arrived at as
to the special material that will be
used in paving the streets, but it is
the general consensus of opinion
among councilmen as well as among
the people affected by paving, that
nothing but a first class article in the
way of paving material should" be
used.
Next fall should Le date for a gene
ral celebration in Flagstaff as a
transformation scene from a country
village to splendidly paved streets,
adequate drainage, cement walks and
a city lighting system that will excell
that of many much larger and more
pretentious city.
It will be but the beginning of big
ger and better things for Flagstaff '
and the people who have brought it
about will enjoy some of their own
good works rapier than leaving it all
to future generations to enjoy.
The city of Flagstaff for the years '
1914 and 1915 have made an enviable
record for themselves and there is
hope that succeeding ones will carry
on the good work.
THE ONLY BRIDGE-SHY
RIVERJN THE WORLD
While the flood situation is serious
at Florence, the actions of the Gila
river toward the bridges that have
been built across it are exceedingly
pecuilar, not to say coy, shy and hard
to please. Once the river sidestepped
the bridge and wandered off a mile
or so to keep from running under it,
and latest reports from the floods in
dicate that the river has every symp
tom of endeavoring to meander around
the new bridge completed by the state
a year or so ago. Along at this
point the Gila seems to be the most
irritable and finiky stream of wet in
the country. About the last resort
seems either to serve an injunction
on the durncd damp lane or build a
whole bcattermcnt of bridges around
them to bewilder it into not running
around or over ono of them. There
are very few conservative and re
spectable rivers that persistently re
fuse to run under, a bridge, and it
seems strange to see a river run off
a milo or two and leave a perfectly
good bridge covering a sand hill.
Many tourists look at the bridge un
der such circumstances and wonder
what the natives went to so much ex
pense for in covering up the sand
hill, while the river is a mile away
gurgling along to itself, only a few
inches deep, waiting for some other
sucker to build a bridge over it. At
present it looks like the only safe
method would be to build a bridge
around the Gila and let nature take
its course.
Street Superintendent Moritz is en
titled to credit for being forehanded
in making water ways through the
snow. Keeping them clear may save
much damage later when knows melt.
