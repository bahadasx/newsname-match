J, G. BUSTON TO CLOSE
OUT HIS DMHY BUSINESS
Has Sold Too Much Farm Land
and Hasn't Enough Pasture
Left For Cows?Will De?
vote Time to Farming.
It will be some surprise to the gen?
eral public to hear that Mr. J. G.
Buston will close the Su arise Dairy,
and discontinue business. He has
reached this positive decision after
due consideration; His reason for
closing, as sUited to a News man, is
not that the business has not been
profitable, but that, owing to hav?
ing sold one of his grass farms he
hasn't enough pasture land left to
support the requisite number of cows.
The overhead expense in handling a
large number of cows is very little
more than for a small number. Be?
sides, the work is very confining and
exacting. The dairyman has few op?
portunities for recreation or for vis?
iting or anything else than right down
at it every day nnd Sunday, too. And
Mr. Huston says he is tired. And, so,
his entire dairy herd and equipment is
for sale. He will continue to live on
the farm, raise and grow cattle, corn,
alfalfa, etc.
Mr. Buston began tho dairy busi?
ness about five years ago. He has
kept between fifty and seventy-five
head of Jersey cows all the time. Last
year, he says, his cows made about
$150.00 each. If he had GO cows on
the iarm this would mean n nice little
sum for milk alone of $0,000.00. The
income from the sale of calves, etc.,
has been cosiderable. In addition, he
has greatly increased the producing
capacity of his farm by the addition
of a large quantity of manure from
his barns. He has succeeded, and his
retirement from the business is due
solely to the fact that he has not
room enough for pasture. It should
be plainly stated, perhaps, that the
farm is not for sale?only the dairy
cattle, equipment, etc.
Mr. and Mrs. Buston are thorough?
ly satisfied in their country home, and
have no idea at present of moving to
town.
A TRIBUTE OF RESPECT.
We bow our heads in grief at the
death of our schoolmate, Lillian Ruth
Gregory. In her death we have lost
one of our sweetest, most effectionate
and kindest pupils.
She was born January 1, 1003, died
January 17, 101G, age 13 years and 17
days. She was taken ill with laryn?
gitis. She was sick a little over a
week and everything that could be,
was done for her relief and recovery,
but God, in his infinite wisdom, snw
that it was best to take this sweet
flower from earth to bloom in heav?
en. She was laid to rest in the ceme?
tery nenr Shawvers Millh.
Ruth is missed in our school. She
was always prompt nnd studied well.
She was kind to the little ones, never
forgetting to help them through in
way she could. Those of us who have
been her school-mates and looked up?
on her sweet face will thank God for
such pleasant associations.
She was one of our most faithful
scholars in Sunday School, always
taking part in exercises of any kind
with pleasure. We know that she is
missed in the home, for the father and
mother will look for the loved one's
face and listen for the fall of her
footsteps often times, but we will say
to them that mourn her untimely
death
Don't be listcning.ior her footstep,
In this earthly shore no more,
For her Father's called her to him,
And she has just gone on before.

Bob Hoback in Trouble in Rluefield.
Robert Hoback, well known here, is
in trouble in Bluefield. Tho Tele?
graph of Tuesday morning contained
tho following:
Bob Hoback, arrested Saturday
night nnd held-to answer the charge
of violating a city ordinance, and
Van Henry, colored, another prisoner,
who was serving a twenty-day sen?
tence on the chaingang, escaped from
the city bastile Sunday, night about
10 o'clock. Hoback was the first to
escape, and had been gone about
thirty minutes before his absence was
discovered. Sergeant White had gone
into the jail to give one of the trus?
ties some cigurettc papers, and as he
opened the door he saw Will Cofield,
another negro prisoner, attempting
to escape. Cofield had become fas?
tened and was unable to move. Of?
ficer White closid the jail door and
ran around back of the building just
in time to see Henry dash into the
alley running back of Bland street.
The police were notified, but no trace
of the man was found.
It was claimed by prisoners in the
jail'that Hoback had been given saws
in the afternoon and about 9 o'clock
he and Henry began to plan their es?
cape. A window about three feet
square at tho back of tho jail, and
about twelve feet from tho floor, was
their only chance, nnd with the use
of a hack-saw their escape was made
easy. The bars were made of three
quarter inch iron and by sawing
three of the bars at the base and
bending them a hole was made large
enough to allow them to get through.
There was another charge pending
against Hobnck, for lighting, but for
sore.c reason he seemed to think that
he was wr nted for whito slavery.
'Die police are satisfied that the saws
were handed Hohaek by a visitor to
the jail Sunday afternoon.
Chief of Police Morrisson issued in?
structions yesterday to the jailor that
hereafter no person would be allow?
ed to talk with any prisoner while in
jail.
"FOIt HEAVENS SAKE DONT

Under date of January IB, 1916, n

LAST MEMBER OF FAMILY.
Frank Carter Was Third to Meet a
Tragic Death.
(Graham Daily News.)
Frank Carter, who died Sunday
night at the Hluelield Sanitarium,
from injuries received at Falls Mills
Sunday when he was jerked under
passenger train No. 2, was the third
of the family lo^meet a tragic death.
About seventeen years ago, his father,
Tom Carter, was shot and killed at
Flat Top Yards by a Norfolk and
Western pumper by the name of Gen?
try. Gentry was sentenced to a term
in the Virginia penitentiary, where
he died.. The tragedy took plnce in
F. D. Morning's store. Will Carter
son of Tom Carter, and brother of
Frank, was killed by being hit by n
freight train at Flat Top about enight
years ago. The accident occurred
about forty steps from the spot where
his father had been shot. Frank, who
was fatally injured by being jerked
under the wheels of No. 2 Sunday,
was the last member of the family.
The young man was twenty-two years
of age and unmarried. He was cm
ployed for a time on the painting
gang of O. N. Edmonds.
He made his home with his grand?
mother, Mrs. Morris, mother of Sam
Morris, of Falls MJills. Sunday it is
said that young Carter in company
with another young man, attempted
to catch No. 2 as the train was pass?
ing the Falls Mills station. He miss?
ed his hold and was thrown under
the train, his right leg being crush?
ed off and one arm badly mashed, be?
sides receiving other injuries. ' He
was taken to the Bluefield saitorium
on No. 2 and died at midnight Sun?
day night.
CHARLES CHASE.
A recent issue of this papr carried
an nccount "of the killing of jCharles
Chase, the young negro chauffeur of
Mrs. Walter Dickenson, of Russell.
The clipping was taken from the
Lebanon News, in which the state?
ment occurred that Chaso was an im?
pudent negro and other things said
reflecting upon the character of the
dead boy. Rlrs. Walter Dickenson, in
an article published in last weeks is?
sue of the Lebanon News, strongly
denies that Chaso was "impudent,"
and gives him a splendid character,
and deeply deplored his death. Mrs.
Dickenson has known this boy and
his family for years, and knows where
of she speaks. Mrs. A. S. Higgin
botham, Mrs. Dickenson's daughter,
fully corroborates her mother's esti?
mate of the boy's character, and with
her mother and the entire family and
many of the best people in -Mrs.
Dickenson's community, deplore the
untimely,^ cruel, uncalled for murder
of the boy. it appears that the kill?
ing of Chase was not the first time the
man Boyd had used his gun with fatal
effect, if reports be true.
The Clinch Valley News would
gladly publish Mrs. Dickenson's
article in full, but the paper contain?
ing it was mislaid.

ROBERT STEELE DEAD.
Robert Steele, perhaps the oldest
citizen of the county, died on Monday
at his home near Steelsburg. The
burial took place on Wednesday. In?
terment was made at Stcele's chap?
el. His wife preceded him to the
grave about seven years. Two sons
and two daughters survive, viz: A. L.
Steele, of Rockbridge, S. S. Steele, of
Fauquier county, and Mrs. Belle Gray
beal, of Williamsburg, W. Vu., and
Mrs. W. C. Witten, of Stteclsbur, nt
whoso home he died.
There seems to be no exact record
of the age of the deceased. Judging
from best information he was about
94 years old. He had been a strong,
vigorous mnn all his life, a consis?
tent member of the Methodist church
and an upright citizen of his county.
The funeral was conducted by pre?
siding elder Hurley.
The Steele's were nmong the earlier
settlcers of tho county. Tho family
came from some point on tho Poto?
mac river.. Deceased's grandfather
settled in the neighborhood of Steels?
burg, and here his father was reared
from boyhood, and here Robert Steele
was born, lived and died. "The links
that bind us" to th cpast, are break?
ing nnd falling .away.

tG IN I A, FUIDAY, JANUARY 28
A Birthday Party.
Last Friday morning the hearts of
forty-live of the dearest and sweetest
little lads and lassies in Tazowell were
made glad by receiving little cards
bearing the following lines:
Ploasvi come to my Birthday Party,
On Saturday, half past one;
I'll take you first to the muttnee,
And after the show is done,
You're still my guests at home, you
see,
For the merry games and fun,
?Towel Jessamine Kendrick.
When Saturday, January 22, (1910)
dawned, it WOB found to bo gloomy and
inauspicious, raining almost, contin?
uously throughout the day. Yet, while
others may have considered the after?
noon a dreary and cheerless one, little
Jewel Jessamine's home on Main
Street was Hooded with sunshine?the
sunshine that emanates from radiant
eyes, rosy lips and happy, childish
laughter. This large assemblage of
beautiful children in their dainty par?
ty dresses, would have delighted the
eyes of an artist.
First, the small hostess examined
and admired the many charming and
desirable gifts that her littlo friends
brought her to render her ninth birth?
day a happy and memorable one;
and then she conducted her guests to
the matinee, where they enjoyed two
long, blissful hours. A special pro?
gram had been arranged - for them by
Lieutenant Gammon, the genial and
cultured manager of the Tazowell
theatre. He also assisted Jewel Jes?
samine in entertaining her little
friends at her home later on. His ex?
tensive travels and twenty years resi?
dence in the mystic lands of the
Orient have endowed him with an
inexhaustible fund of delightful ex?
periences, absorbingly interesting to
both young ami old, who are so for?
tunate as to form his acquaintance.
At home once more and all the little
ones were ready and enger for re?
freshments. Misses Margaret and
Anne Byrd Walke/, Mary and Martha
Coulling served candies, cake, nuts
and fruits; and, when these were fin?
ished, all eyes were centered on the
large birthday cake with its nine lit?
tle pink candles on u table decorated
with a beautiful lace cover, and a
great vase of pink carnations. Oh,
how interested were they in the cer?
emony of cutting this cake to find
the ring, dime and darning needle
hidden therein!
Master John Kllis Jackson secured
the ring; therefore, according to the
time-honored belief, he will be the
first of them all to marry. Soon lit?
tle Rosalind St. Glair, tossing back
her beautiful curls joyously, exclaim?
ed: "I have the dime! Shall be rich?
er than any of you some day." And
then, to her utter consternation, Miss
Mary Coulling found the darning
r.eedle; so, of course (?) she will
have to be "an old n-aid."
Hut, the most intoieating feature
of the afternoon's entertainment,
seemed to be in the blackboard contest
"Putting n Coin in the Blind Man's
Hat." For a half hour this created
perfect gales of merriment. The
prizes offered in this contest, (two
handsome boxes of candy), were won
by Miss Martha Coulling and Miss
Lena Greevcr.
At twilight nil the children gath?
ered around their little hostess to bid
her goodbye, thanking her for their
delightful afternoon and wishing her
many happy returns of the day. At
last little Miss Sammie Scott, very
prettily and gracefully voiced the
sentiments of them nil by saying:
"This is certainly the most splendid
birthday party I have ever known."
When all was over, little Jewel Jes?
samine- said with a sigh of supreme
content, "As long ns I live I can nev?
er have a happier birthday than this."

Tho opporuiiily to become acquaint^
ed with und hear men and women of
national reputation, doesn't oftou
come to the inhabitants of small in?
land towns and counties, except to
those citizens who lind it convenient
to visit the large cities. The people
of Tazowoll, within the past few years

Bob Burdctto, the Taylors, Stuarts,
General Gordon and others, of equal
merit, if not quite so famous.

tation, and great orators are in our

For more (ban 25 years ho 1ms, by

haps, than to any other man.
Wendell Phillips was anti-slavery,
and dedicated his wonderful abilities
patiently ami effectively for decades
to its overthrow. Wolley is nntt-liq
uor, and no loss vigorously and effec?
tively is hurling himself and all bis
forces to the overthrow of the liquor
Imfilc.
There should be a great audience?
a capacity audience, at tin? Presby?
terian church tonight lo hear the two

a lion waked out of a great sleep."

IS BROTHER CANNON SCARED?
(From Staunlon News.)
There are only two reasons why
.he prohibitionist should not want a
aw permitting the shipment and con?
sumption of a certain amount of
iquor by individuals. Either tho pro?
hibitionists do not favor real strin?
gent prohibition in Virginia, and
would regulate only the sale and not
the uso of liquor, or they ndmit, by
implication; that tho Demon Bum is
in evil only relatively and propor?
tionately. Either they do not believe
i real prohibition law could po:.sibly
i)e enforced in Virginia, or they aro
willing for every citizen to drink
liquor to a limited amount.
If wo- are to allow every man to
have whiskey shipped into thu stnto
for his personal use in any quantity
ut any time, tho majority of men will
find easy and abundant means to get
us much shipped as they wish and at
any time they wish.
Let us have one thing or tho other,
gentlemen, let us either bo honestly
"dry" or honestly "wet."
