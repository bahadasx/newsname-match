CONFIDENCE IN HIS SUBJECTS
LONDON. Jan. 27. Parliament
was prorogued today until February
15. In the prorogation King George
said:
"We shall not lay down our arms
until we have vindicated Ihe cause
which carries with it the future of

The speech of the king probably
was the briefest on record on such
an occasion, but his references to
the war were regarded as highly im
portant. "For eighteen months my navy
and army have been engaged in
concert with brave and steadfast
allies in defending our common lib
erties and the public law of Europe
against unprovoked - encroachments
by the enemy," he said. "I am sus
tained by the determination of my
people at home and overseas to
carry our flag to a final decisive vic
tory. "In this struggle, forced upon us by
those who hold In light esteem the lib
erty and covenants which wo regard as
sacred, we shall not lay down our arms
until we have vindicated the cause which
carries with It the future of civilisation.
"I rely with confidence on the loyalty
and efforts of all my aubjects, which have
never failed me, and I pray that Almighty
God may give us Ills blessings."
The king thanked the House of Com
mons for the ungruding liberality with
which it has provided for the heavy de
mands of the war. The speech was read
by Baron Buckmaster of Cheddlngton,
the lord high chancellor.

Formal Matter.
HE SPEAKS TO CLERGYMEN
NEW YORK, Jan. 27. President

three addresses here at noon before
the clerical conference ot the New
York Federation of Churches, rep
resenting all denominations.
Rev. Neheraiah Boynton, io an atf-
dress of..welcnie saldt '..
"Wo simply want to put ourselves
by ycur side as you enter upon your
work of being the spokesman for
perysanent peace for America and
Ufe world."
The president said he appreciated the
work of the speaker "fent the heart."
He declared that in hi-, efforts for peace
he had represented the "spirit" of the
United Btates of America. He said he
knew that In their hearts the people ot
the United Ctaws wanted to "keep the
balance even."
"I can find no basis for peace but Jus
tice," he added. "The greatest force In
this world Is character, and I believe that
character ean be expressed by the acts
of a nation. This Is expressed by the
attitude of the reople.
"A further foundation of seace Is our
internal attitude toward each other. We
have been hospitable to ail creeds and
people. The peace of America depends
upon the attitude of the different races
and creeds widen make up the nation. I
have been much perturbed over evidences
of religious feelings In this country. L4vo
and let live is a homely expression, but
It expresses what our attitude should be.
"I always accept an - invitation ' to a
fight, but I hope I conduct my fight with
Justice and fairness."
The president deoJared that the neutral
ity of the United States has not- been a
merely formal matter, but that it has
been a matter . of conviction and from
the heart. He said that In his efforts
for peace he hsd been conscious of rep
resenting the spirit of America and no
private conviction merely of his own.
"America," he added, "has always stood
resolutely and sbsolutely for the 'right
of every people to determine Its own des
tiny and Its own affairs."
The president illustrated the attitude
of the United states toward .weaker na
Hons by his Mexican policy.
He was given a formal vote of thanks

half of peace.
Crowds filled the streets so densely
when the president left the hall that lili

SENATORS ATTACK
MUNITIONS TRADE
Dozen Members Denounce Traffio
While Its Defenders Are
' Silent.
PLEA OF MILLION REFERRED
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27. An out
burst of denunciation against ship
ment of American-made war muni
tions to European . belligerents
stirred the senate today, reflecting a
revival of the sentiment which may
force a vote upon embargo resolu
tions thai ' have, been- pending In
committee for seeral months. , ;
A doten senators, including demo
crats as well as republicans, assailed
the munitions traffic, while those
who. have sided with the adminis
tration In its stand that an embargo
would violate international law. were
for the most part silent.
Test Vote Averted.
A petition for an embargo bearing
more than a million signatures, precipi
tated the debate. A test vote at one
time seemed Inevitable, but It was
averted after much parliamentary ma
neuvering by reference of the petition
to the foreign relations committee.
Senator Kenkon, republican, started ths
discussion In presenting the petition,
which had been sent to the senate by the
organisation of American women for
strict neutrality. The Iowa senator char
acterised the sale of munitions abroad
as a "cold-blooded money-making propo
sition."
An embargo was vigorously urged also
by Senators Hitchcock, Clapp, Works,
Ashurst, Lane, Mlartlne and LaFullette.
Other senators who spoke in favor of an
embargo but thought the question of
whether It might be a breach of neu
trality should first be thoroughly ' con
sidered by the foreign relations commit
tee, were Clarke of Arkansas, Clark of
Wyoming, 8moot and Townsend.
Opiwloa of atom.
Senator Stone, chairman of the foreign
relations committee before which the
embargo resolutions' are pending, said ha
had opinions on 'the merits of the icsue,
but thought this was not tbe time to
dicuss them. Senator Robinson was the
only senator who expressed himself ss
actually opposed to an embargo, ,

MANY COLONELS
FOR POSTMASTER
Candidates for Wharton Succession
Bombarding- Hitchcock in
Washington.
EITHER FANNING OR HOWELL
(From a Staff Correspondent.)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27. (Spe
cial Telegram.) As groundhog day
comes on apace and the term of
Postmaster John C Wbarton grows
correspondingly less, the faithful In
the democratic party of Omaha, who
are candidates for the.poatofflcc, are
becoming more and more persistent
and are bombarding Senator Hitch
cock, and Incidentally Congressman
Lobeck, with letters and petitions.
Hy one of those strange situations, al
ways remarkable, every candidate for the
poet mastership Is a colonel, as follows:
Colonel Charles E. Fannin, Colonel Will
iam Hall, Colonel Ed Gotten, Colonel Jeff
W. Idford. Colonel Frank L. Weaver.
Colonel Itlrherd Lee Metcalfe, Colonel Ed
Howell, Colonel Henry Richmond and
Colonel J. J. O'Connor. If any colonels
have escaped It Is through modesty on
their part In falling to Inform Senator
Hitchcock that they would like to have
the Job.
While Senator Hitchcock Is as close as
a clam over the Wharton succession,
there are those who, enjoying the sena
torial sunshine, believe that Colonel
Charles B. Fanning Is looked upon most
favorably by the senior senator, who will
make the appointment because It fs his of
right.
Colonel Hall has a bundle of strong let-
ters enthusiastically endorsing him, but
Senator Hitchcock Is playing for his own
return to the senate and he does not
want to make a mistake In the post mas
tership. Therefore, look out for Fanning
or Senator Ed IIowelL
