made by the visitors and it will be
followed by a reception by President
Holland In the president's house.

held in the armory.
All Urged to Participate
With a view to convincing the
students that the inauguration of the
President is a vital matter to them

cial plans to insure the participation
of the students in the ceremonies.
Arrangements will be made to have
all of the classes take places in the
academic procession, which should
be a notable event, all the dignity
Possible will be added to the. exer
cises. Believing that the inaugura
tion of the president is of greater
Importance to the students than to
any other class of people In the state,
the faculty and board of regents will
take steps to arouse the maximum of
Interest among the undergraduates.
All students will be urged especi
ally to attend the reception in the
president's house and the inaugural

A national Pay-up Week lias ox it)
fixed for February 21 to 26 and will
be observed in many communities in
all parts of the United states. The
press has taken kindly to the idea
as Is evidenced by the following fa
vorable comments:
Km- Instance, the Paulding, Ohio,
Democrat says: "National Pay-up
Week is the biggest thing approach
ing —every retail merchant, doctor,
lawyer, preacher every one in fact,
should be Interested in National
Pay-up Week, February 21 to 26,
1916."
The Northfleld, Minnesota, News
Bays in a lengthy editorial: "The
plan of National Pay-up Week has
much to commend it. as the mer
chants of this city and in fact any
city will affirm with a ureal deal of
pleasure."
The Illinois State Journal, Spring
field, Illinois, says, "National Pay
up Week is an excellent movement.
It is one of the most sensible efforts
ever launched in bringing about con
certed action throughout the coun
try. Springfield will join with hun
dreds of cities in the United State
in observing National Pay-up
Week."
The Border Telephone, Hume,
Missouri, says: "In Inaugurating
Pay-up Week communities are Im
proving upon the century old custom
of the Chinese who, as is well known,
will not enter upon a new year with
the slightest debt hanging over them.
Two Pay-up Weeks within a year
may be a little too often for Hume,
but it won't hurt anyone except it
be a few deadbeats and deadbeats
don't count for much." It will be
remembered that Hume had a-local

ARM BROKEN IN

Altercation Willi Ivas Mays—
Assail Case Dismissed
With a broken arm, the result of
an altercation with Ivas Hays, night
engineer, D. F. Rouse, superintend
ent of the college heating plant, went
into Justice Henry's court yesterday
to charge Hays with second degree
assault, but following the taking of
evidence, Justice Henry dismissed
the case, basing his action on the evi
dence submitted, which showed that
the attack of Hays on Rouse was
provoked.
The altercation occurred last Sat
urday, when Superintendent Rouse
took his night man to task for per
mitting the steam to drop during the
recent cold spell, when several
plants in the college greenhouses
were frozen. Hays stated that he
had done his full duty, and that the
plant was operated to its capacity at
all times. A dispute ensued, and
Rouse alleged that his arm was
broken when he was struck by a gas
pipe in the hands of Hays. He se
cured a warrant for Hays' arrest and
the case was heard yesterday. Rouse
charged second degree assault and
alleged that Hays made an assault
with a deadly weapon, a gas pipe,
with intent to do bodily harm.
The defendant did not, deny that
he had hit Rouse with the pipe, but
based his defense on self-defense,
claiming that he was first struck by
Rouse, who used a handle from a
tool. This evidence was strength
ened by physicians, who stated that
Hays' back showed evidence of the
blow.
Six witnesses were heard, but
none of them were present when the
altercation started, seeing only the
finish of the affair.
Mr. Rouse denied any attack on
Hays, but the latter claimed that
even after he had struck the super
intendent on the arm he was forced
to clinch with him to protect himself
from attack. •
The- case attracted considerable
attention, and Judge Henry's court
room was crowded with interested
court fans.

PRESIDENT ERNEST O. HOLLAND
Cordial Welcome to New President
Much Enthusiasm Manifested at
Banquet Chen by Chamber of
Commerce in Honor of
| E. O. Holland
The reception and banquet given
Wednesday evening by the Chamber
of Commerce in honor of President
E. O. Holland and his sister Mrs.
'in ford, was i liable for its large
p.tiondance and enthusiasm. About
175 were present and all entered
heartily into the spirit of the occa
sion. All of the members of the
board of regents of the college were
present and shared in the cordial
welcome to the new president.
A receiving line was formed in the
church and every one was given an
opportunity to meet President Hol
land. Mrs. Gifford and the regents
before going down to the banquet
which was served in the basement
dining room. Dr. Hays offered the!
invocation and after all had partaken ;
of the excellent menu, Mayor Jack
son assumed the duties of toast
master and aroused much merriment I
by his witty introductions of the
speakers. After a few words of wel
come to President Holland by Will
iam Goodyear. Dr. E. A. Bryan re- ;
sponded to the toast "Hail and Fare
well." He eulogized his successor
highly and predicted for him a long
aud successful administration. He
said that while his official relations
with the college had ceased, there
was a deeper relation between him
and the institution which, like the j
relations of a family, could never |
cease, but emphasized his belief that
"the dead hand of the past should
not try to reach into the future" and
made it'very plain that he should i
not attempt in any way to Influence
the policies of the new administra
tion. He urged the people of Pull
man to give their hearty support and
co-operation to the new president.
and dwelt upon the wonderful op
portunities for the growth of the col
lege, as the varied resources of the
state are developed.
E. T. Coman, president of the
board of regents, responded to the
toast "Choosing" a College President'
In a witty but earnest speech. He
; stated that when he went east to In
j vestigate the standing of several of
the candidates for the position here,
he visited a number of well known
J educational institutions and was
j rather surprised to find that in it 3
| plant and faculty, the State College
: compared favorably with any of
them. He spoke very highly of the
attainments and past record of Dr.
Holland, which had convinced the
regents that he was the right man
to take up the work which President
i Bryan had laid down. While visit-;
j ing a college in lowa he was shown
I over the campus by a professor who
was a little deaf, and persisted In in
troducing him as Dr. Coman, and
he said that by similar errors he ac
quired as many degrees during the
trip as were possessed by Dr. Hol
land and Dr. Bryan.
In responding to the toast "Rela
tions of the High School and Col
lege," .1. W. Graham, city superin
tendent of schools, said that in his
opinion the college simply represent
ed the higher grades not taught In
the high school. lie spoke of the
great benefits which the local high
school had derived from the college
and of the friendly relations which
existed between the institutions, as
evidenced by the fact that five gradu
ates of the college are teaching in
the high school and that 78 gradu
ates of the high school are attend
ing the college. He urged the bene
fits of co-operation, as compared to
the detriments of competition, and
expressed the hope that the schools
of Pullman would always be work
ing on a friendly basis with the col
lege for the tip-building of the whole
community.
B. F. Campbell made another de
cided hit when be responded to the
toast "Receptions to College Presi
dents." He wittily contrasted the
reception given to the second presi
dent, who was pelted off the campus
by students, with the banquet given
in honor of Dr. Holland and stated
that in the early days of the college
nobody thought of greeting new
presidents with receptions or speed
ing old ones with banquets. If the
people let them go without molesta
tion they thought that they had done
their full duty. He recalled the
greeting given to President Bryan on
his arrival when he addressed the
few residents of Pullman in a little
room in the old school building.
After dwelling upon the ambition of
the local school board to make the
Pullman schools the best In the state,
he expressed his pleasure that the
new president of the college has had
wide experience In public school
work and will be able to give valu
able advice and assistance in the solv
ing of school problems. He closed
by asserting that Pullman has now
established the custom of giving
banquets to retiring presidents of the
college and promised President Hol
land that a farewell banquet will be
given him when he finishes his work
here, but expressed the hope that it
would not be held till 1950.
Coach W. H. Dietz was introduced
as the man who had "Kicked W. S.
C. Into publicity." He modestly gave
most of the credit for the success
of the recent football season to his
players, whom he eulogized highly
for their excellent spirit and ability
to assimilate Instruction. He told of
the game with Brown and attributed
the victory in large part to the super
ior physical condition of the western
players, gained by hard work in the
open air, while their eastern oppon
ents were spending their vacations at
fashionable watering places In danc
ing and tennis. He went on to argue
that the young men who complain
because they do not have rich fath-
