DANCE BIG SUCCESS
Water Wagon Circle Gets A
Big Crowd Out.
It was just ad we had predicted.
A kick in every round and one of
the gosh blame Jest biggest and
best natured crowds that ever
gathered under one roof in the
town of Ekala<a. One big rip

took the platform until the all
but dull finish. The boys guaran

Ilatton, A. McQuisten and
"Aboot" Frank Thompson on the
receiving, disbursing, door and
water committee the old wagon
was kept right side up and all
passengers safely landed. The
dancing program produced such
examples of the terpsichorean
art as tht; gin fizz waltz, cherry
flip one-step. Tom and Jerry two

wagon circle two-step, gin ricky
waltz and Sprudel water quadrille.

expectations, there wasn't a soul
soused or beneath the dignity of
a true Keeleyite during the whole j
affair and as all passengers that
embarked on the wagon before

For every ailment there are perhaps from fifty to
several hundred remedies, some good, some fair, some
poor, and some even dangerous. When you buy yours
what assurance have you that it's the best to be had,
that it contains nothing harmful to your system?
There's only one line of remedies we know of

Stock Rustling Doomed.
For no accountable reason the I
occupation of live stock stealing i
seems to go hand in hand with
the legitimate live stock indus
try. In the days of old when the
live stock business predominated
in this western country, the rust- j
ler was a very prominent charac- ;
ter but 'the quick and effective j
"home rule" laws which
administered to them then, and
which in many cases left him
lifeless on the prairie or dang
ling from a sturdy tree, some
what checked his operations and
tended greatly to curtail the
business. In this particular sec
tion the art of horse stealing in j
particular has been handed down
to date in a very marked manner
until it was getting to be a com
mon occurrance for the rancher
to lose from one to a dozen hor
ses at a time. These rustlers
worked in groups and after mak
ing their haul would gather their
stuff at a common point and ship
it out of the country. Local au
thorities have been working very j
diligently on this problem for the
past three years doing very ef-;
fective work, but something over
a year ago, at the suggestion of |
the local states attorney the of
fleers of this and the surrounding
counties met at Belle Fourche to
determine wavs and means to
put a stop to live stock stealing.
Results came swift and certain
and at this last term of court in
Butte County which has just
closed, Wm. Mem, Wm. Uren,
Chas. Crage and Frank Erlhoff
were convicted of horse stealing.
In Meade County at the last term
of court, Joshua Golfey, William
J. Bryan Guffey and R. C. James
were convicted of horse stealing
and receceived sentences of from
! 18 months to 5 years in the state
j penitentiary. In addition to the
! above some six other convictions,
! have been secured on the
same
charge and the results has thrown
a chill into the horse thieves of
this entire section and the author
ities believe they will soon rid the
country of all of them. If stock
men will be prompt and accurate
in reporting to the sheriff of their
respective counties the theft ofi
any live stock they will greatly
assist the organization in the dis
charge of itsjduty. Belle Fourche
