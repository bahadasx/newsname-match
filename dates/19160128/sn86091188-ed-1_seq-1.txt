Dear Sir:— Yours of the 15th en
efoslng petitions from ttie Lemhi
Business Men's Association, addres
sed to Mr Center is at hand and Mr

and acknowledgment. It is possible
to at range a Farmers, Movable school

dates that the Extension party will
be in that ounty are Feb. 17, 18 and
19. These three days will be devoted
to meetings at Salmon and at Ten
doy, both of which places In your
county submitted petitions for the
school.
Probably in the party will be Mr.
Center, our Allrector, Mr. E. J. Id
dli gs,' Dean of the college of Ida. and
at the bead of the live stock depart
ment and Miss Amy Kelly, Lecturer
in Home Economics and probably
some one else who will speak along
the lihes of general agriculture.
This will constitute a very good in
stitute party and you can at least
publish the names I have given you
and the dates. It has not «een de
cided exactly just how much of the
three days will he given to Tendoy
and to Salmon, but more than likely
the speakers will he interchanged be
tween the two places so that all
speakers will have a chance to give
their subjects at each olsce.
We wish to thank you for your in
terest and for the splendid petition
which in itself is an indication of
the interest shown.
Yours very truly,
E. P. TAYLOR,

.Millions of these fish as well as

lief sought.

<
Rev K. N. Qulst preached at the
Presbyterian church last Sunday
ii orning on the subject of Watchful
ness, from the text Matthew 25:31. |
The importance of watchfulness Is j
continually brought to our mind by |
Cl® ist, as well as by the prophets of j
the Old Testament and the A|M.;tles,
Many parables were spoken by our
Lord, reminding us of the uucer
ta'nty of life and the certainty of
His return as a "thief in the night "
"Watch, therefore, for ye know neith
er the day nor the hour wherein ttie
Son of man cometh."'
Tills admonition is no less needed
today. The time is at hand "whan
men will not endure sound doctrine,"
and we have more false religions to
day than at any other time In the
history of the world. Many of these
religions have enough truth to make
the masses of tiie people believe In
them. "Watch, therefore."
This is an age when tiie prophecies
cf the Bible are being fulfilled very
rapidly. The "Wars and rumors of
wars," with pestilence and famine,
and earthquakes, that Christ said
were to precede his return in glory,
may be at hand.
lie will come as a thief in tiie
night "wheo men least expect Him.
Let us therefore, watch and pray in
order to be ready for ills return.
