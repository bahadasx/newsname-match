Our, New York Letter.
Editor Independent:
The beautiful letter of Mr. Meeka
of Cprinth in your issue of the 14th
of this month, in which lie so feeling
ly refers to my mother, is the heart
felt outpouring of the best sentiments
of a true McNarian. Most people
love their native soil, but 1 never have
Been Tennesseeans so devoted as those
born in o)d McNairy. I have often
referred to the intense affection main
tained by General Marcus J. Wright,
of Washington D. C, for the land and
traditions of his native county, and 1
have seen other men ' from there in
whose eyes the tears would ' come
- when speaking of old Purdy. There
is something more than mere senti-
, meat behind such feelings; I feel it
coming on me as I grow older; a ten
derness toward the familiar, names
yM scene :st siy childhood .home,
that cannot be bestowed upon any
other spot on this earth. - How those
feelings arose on reading the letter
. of Mr. Meeka, and at the mere men
tion of the names of our old neigh
. bora! ' I would like to meet him and
take him by the hand. He knew Pur
dy in its ante-bellum prime; when 1
first saw it the town was on the down-
- hill grade, but from the lips of that
mother, who was an honor to ' her
- native Boil, I have heard the story of
its brighter days, and of the good,
generous people who had their homes
- Jhere. I could add ' to hisT list the
famijy of . Nash; Cross, Kendall . (or
Kindle), Roraine, Stumph, Lebow,
Maness. Hockaday, Barnhill, and
many others whose names were house
hold words with us.' ' K v ' ' !
I could also - tell W. Meeks that
one of my mother's cherished legends
was that when the war was breaking
out in 1861 or earlier, and the tine of
cleaveage was forming to separate
friends, neighbors and even families,
General Meeks and my grandfather,
Lindsay Sanders, ' had a long, quiet
talk one Sunday afternoon at tho lat
ter'a house and made a covenant with!
each other that they would remain
friends, no matter what happened,
and would help each other if occasion
offered. The war came on, and , each
side, honestly fighting for what was
believed to be right, lined up against
the other.' My' grandfather was a
union man and abolitionist, and as
such had many enemies at that dark
period, but the friendship between
him and General John H. Meeks (I am
t not sure of the first part of his name
" at this distance) never wavered.
The name of that grand old man was
always honored in our Household;
and the name of Meeks sounds good
to me till this day. I met that tal
ented member of the bar, Marcus
Henry Meeks, in Nashville ten years
ago; also a son of our old friend Dr.
Kindle, who was then in the commis
sion business. The latter had some
of th i best stories I ever heard, to
tell about Crunch Plunk, the famous
augar-aater and Bill Jopling.

The man who drafted the income
tax law,' Representative Cbrdell Hull,
was one of the most interesting men
I met while employed as special pen
sion examiner in Tennessee. I had to
take his testimony as a witness in a
Spanish war claim v;He was then just
plain Judge Hull at Gainesboro, Jack
son county, but he had such a remark
able memory of details -as to the case
io question, that I did not forget him,
among the thousands of witnesses
seen during my ten years of that ser
vice. - : -
I heard stories about Judge Hull
then that were prophetic of future
greatness for this solon of the back
woods. ' One was to the effect that g
certain young fellow got into trouble
which landed him in jail. He bad
been in trouble before, but because
of the fact that soma of his family
were among the richest people in that
section, he had always gotten off with
a light fine, or escaped punishment
altogether. But he ha! not had Cor
dell Hull to reckon with. This time
it was different. When the young
offender came, up for sentence, his un
cle lounged into the judge's office and
said; "Now, look here, Jadge, you're
not going to be hard on Charlie, are
you? You know we've always been
good friends of yours, and you may
want to run for office again some
time. You know the standing or our
family; none of us has ever been in
jail, and you can't afford to put that
boy in the jug; it will get the whole
neighborhood down on you. I'll see
that he behaves himself, if you'll turn
him loose and let him go along home
to his mammy.".
It was said Judge Hull simply asked
the question: "Is he guilty r
The rich uncle said he supposod he
was, but "boys will be boys," etc. was
the excuse.
"Well, if he is guilty, he goes to
jail, that's all," and to jail that boy
went One version had it that the
uncle wanted to raise a row about it,
and the Judge intimated that Charlie
was lonesome, and he could go to jail
and keep him .company, if he did't
keep quiet; but you know how stories
like that will grow. But if that
uncle's anger had any ' effect on the
election's returns it was in favor of
Judge Cordell Hull, and how well the
people chose in sending him to . Con
gress, is now a part of the history of
the nation. Ha is young yet, and
may go much higher." ' "
I could tell a whole book about the
good'stories I heard in Tennessee, and
especially in Jackson county. ' One
was about an old-time character
named Zeb Nettles. Zeb was an in
veterate lover of whiskey, and hardly
ever paid a cent for ; his liquor.
Once he went into -a grocery - store
near Flynn's Lick and bought a peck
of crackers. He sampled them,
didn't like them, and said: "I'll swap
them for a pock of meal." AH the
time he was peeping around for the
sight of a demijohn, which he finally
located under the counter. The meal,
he declared, was musty, and he said
he'd swap it off for a side of bacon.
The bacon was handed him. but he
discovered skippers in it, slammed it
down, made a dive under the counter,
got the demijohn of whiskey, and
started out with it. "Hold on there!"
cried the storekeeper; "You haven't
paid me for that whiskey V "Didn't
I swap you the bacon fer hit?" . snap
ped out old Zeb. "Yes but you didn't
pay me for the bacon, either !" "Well,
I swapped the meal to you fer that,"
answered Zeb, and by that time he
was at the door, and made a clean
get-away with the liquor.
Another, very old and widespread
yarn was about a courtship A young
chap named Speck-Neck Smith urged
his attentions on a girl who had no
use for him, and one day followed
her home from church and went into
the kitchen where she was helping
her mother with the dinner. He tor
mented her with his unwelcome woo
ing, finally coming up behind ber and
whispering. in her ear: "Whose dar
ling are you?" "Not yourn, ye gol
durned fool, you!" the desperate girl
exclaimed, dashing hot water over
him. That broke up the match. '
There was another, even more pop
ular tale, about a couple who, after a
long courtship, were almost in despair
of coming to the final decision. - One
evening, Jake, the young chap, deter
mined to have it over with. Their
rocking chairs approached each other
by degrees, and finally, Jake, his eyes
bulging and winking and his throat
wobbling like a frog trying to swal
low something to big for him, blurted
out: "I'm mad!" "What fer, Jake?"
"Caze ye won't have me!" "Case ye
hain't axed me!" , Then they were en
gaged, and quickly married. Soon
afterward they were heard talking by
the kitchen stove, and Jake, exclaimed,
bis voice choking with affection: "Sal,
Ise a-mind to bite ye!" "What fer,
Jake r, "Caze I love ye!" Could
whole volumes furnish any more elo
quent expression of love than that?
Conjugal attachment , is as strong
among these people as it ia among
the heroes of novels. But the women
marry too young. I heard of wives
in Jackson county only twelve or thir
teen years old.

The Sanders Burying Ground.
NEAR OLD PURDY
,- . " -
Over softly creeping vines.
When the evening sun inclines,
Lengthening cedar shadows fall
Like a light funeral pall.
Where two little mounds were made
Underneath a friendly shade, '
Rest, afar from pain or strife.
He and she who gave me life.
Little child and hoary sage " - -Ended
here their pilgrimage;
Many kindred here are found;
Tis the Sanders burying ground.
Baby brother, sister dear.
Slumber free from sorrow here;
Parents who for loved ones wept
Long together now have slept. '
Like a bridegroom and his bride,
They are lying side by side v , .
In the soil of Tennessee,
Married for eternity.
Never sound of war shall come
To disturb that holy tomb;
AgfB long shall come and go,
But no trouble they shall know.
Though the world in fire shall melt,
Never will its flames be felt
By those forms, for ne'er again
.Shall they suffer any pain.
For I know that God is good,'
And to them that here withstood
Dire temptation, wrong and strife,
He hath given a crown of life!
0, to be at rest with them,
And to see the diadem
Of eternal life they wear
In that better land so fair!
Tell me. Child of Bethlehem,
Am I not a part of them.
They that bore me can their love
Find a place for me above?
Unbeliever, can you say
There shall never come a day
When those loved ones I shall meet
And my friends and kindred greet?
Hearts and minds so warm and bright
Were not made for endless night!
Hope say 8: "We shall meet again;"
Faith sa7s: "Hope ia'not in vain!"
