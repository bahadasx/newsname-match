George Bothner, Former Lightweight Wrestling Champion.
George Bothner, former lightweight wrestling champion, has been refer
eeing wrestling bouts In New York. He warned Ivan Linow, a wrestler,
about fouling, and Linow got sore. Bothner challenged him to a match
for $600. Linow refused to bet, but took on the match.
In a 22-mlnute bout Linow was unable to throw the old-timer. He asked
for five more minutes, was allowed the extra time and even then couldn't
throw the former champion.

Players Increase in Numbers in

man Herbert Planning for
Many New Trophies.
"In spite of the general business de
pression in the earlv nart of the vear
and the disturbance caused by the
war, the polo season has been one of
the most successful in recent vears."
This statement was made by H. L.
Meroert. chairman of the Polo asso
ciation In New York.
"One of the most gratifying features
of the last season," said Mr. Herbert
Is the number of young men who
have taken up the sport and the skill
they have displayed. This more par
ticularly applies to the young mem
bers of the Long Island and Pennsyl
vania clubs, which are exceptionally
fortunate In having such promising
material to draw upon.
"With an idea of further encourag
ing competition among the clubs, the
officials of the Polo association are
outlining the conditions for a number
of new trophies to be played for under
most attractive conditions. The full
particulars of these cups will be laid
before the members for annroval at
the annual meeting, which is held In
reoruary.
The outstanding feature of the last
season was the tournament which was

NEW Q'"!EN OF LAWN TENNIS
Molla BJurstedt of Norway, Capturei
National Women's Championships
Defeats May Sutton.
Miss Molla BJurstedt of Chrlstlanla
Norway, now a resident of New York
has swept everything before her in the
tennis events of this past summer, cap
turing the women's national indoor
championship and outdoor champion
ship, along with many other signifi
cant titles. And if any doubts re
mained In the minds of the tennis
players relative as to whether or not
her wins might be due to the fact
that America's foaemnat wnmpn ex.
ponents were unable to participate in
tnese national events, they were, no
doubt, dispelled when this Norwegian
girl, on Invading the territory of the
world-famous Mrs. May Sutton Bandy,
scoring a straight set defeat on the
latter before a representative Cali
fornia gallery.
If consistent winning ability Is the
true test of superior play, then Miss
BJurstedt can well be looked upon as
Molla BJurstedt,
commanding a championship game,
since she has decisively defeated the
rank and file of women players
throughout the country.
The Norwegian player also has the
distinction of being the only foreigner
who ever won the United States tennis
championship. Just as Mrs. May Sut
ton Bundy has the distinction' of being
the only American who ever won the
English championship, which feat she
accomplished la. 1801 and 1906,

Stockholm. Just now the Baltic is
the sea of adventure. Normally it 1b
a dull, insipid sea. After war be
gan the Baltic woke up a little, but
ts liveliness was limited by Grand
Admiral Tlrpitz's command of the sea.
Now about ten British submarines,
backed by some Russian submarines,
have awakened the ordinarily quiet
waters. All Baltic ports are nests of
espionage, adventure, patriotic hero
ism and roguery, chiefly the last
named.
Stockholm ignores the war, but it
is full of Russian and German Jobbers
who gamble in exchange. Copenhagen
is the chief center of German espion
age. The saloons and fourth-rate ho
tels are thronged with German agents.
Llbau, since Von Hlndenburg cap
tured it last summer, is the headquar
ters of a German motorboat corps
which does scouting in Riga gulf,
nernosand, Oxelosund and other
small Swedish eastern ports are the
homes of scores of marooned German
merchant captains whose ships have
been torpedoed or bottled up.
The liveliest places are Haparanda
and Tornea, frontier townlets on the
Tornea Elf river, which dtvidRB
Sweden from Russian Finland. These
townlets, 30 .miles from the Arctic
circle, are crowded with spies, con
traband smugglers and fugitive pris
oners. The Russian gendarme Colonel
Abassoff discovered two German spies
in Tornea recently. With six gen
darmes he pursued the suspects to
Karungi, further up the river, and be
sieged them in a house. After a two
hour battle the two Germans and
four Russians lay dead.
In coming here from Copenhagen,
via Malmo, one has to cross the
sound, the entrance gate of the British
submarines. The sound is an Inter
national waterway, but it is also ter
ritorial, being less than three miles
across at the narrowest point The
Swedes, own the east side and the
Danes the west. The other entrances,
the Great and Little Belt, which are
entirely owned by Denmark, were
mined against submarines in October,
1914.
Danes and Swedes could not agree
about mining the sound. The Swedes
regret this, for the submarines have
disturbed the halcyon calm of the Bal
tic and injured Sweden's trade with
Germany.
After England had got at least four
submarines through, Germany mined
the sound. Mines were planted in a
big triangular patch in the south and
German patrol boats were set to watch
It. At least two English submarines
have got between or under the mines
and more may come any day,
From the Malmo steamer could be
Been uermany s tremendous meas

the mine Held, on the horizon, is a
forest of masts and funnels belong
ing to the big flotilla of cruisers, gun
boats, armed trawlers and motor pa
trol boats. Their business Is to watch
tor and destroy submarines that get
past the mines. Ahead of the flotilla
flew a hydroplane. The Malmo Bteam-
er captain said that when he had
sailed a boat south a few days before
he had counted about fifty German
craft of different kinds all on the look
out. From the sound down to the
broad water between Sweden and
Rugen island every mile of sea has a
small German warship on the watch.
At Copenhagen the police brought
aboard for transit to Russia an alleged
spy. In the Baltic ports are swarms
of purely military and naval spies who

Famous "Prisoner of the Mahdr
Visits Medina.
Man Held In Chains for Twelve Years
by the Mahdl and Freed by Kitch

tic Career.
Constantinople. Bronzed like a na
tive son of the desert and In dress,
speech and manners an Arab, the only
white man who ever openly visited
Medina, the holy city of, the Moham
medans, recently returned here. The
pilgrim was Dr. Karl Neufeld, the fa
mous "prisoner of the Mahdl," who
was liberated by Lord Kitchener in
the Sudan many years ago.
Few men have had a more romantic
and exciting career than this celebrat
ed traveler. As a physician, teacher,
merchant and contractor he went to
the Sudan in 1886. When the uprising
of the natives began he was taken
prisoner by the Mahdl and kept in
chains for twelve years. Freed by
Kitchener, he returned to Germany,
but after a lecturing tour he made
his way back to the Sudan. Shortly
after the outbreak of the present war
he had to leave his adopted country
again, as he was expelled by the Brit
ish authorities.
After his return to Germany he was
sent to Constantinople, where he
placed himself at the disposal of the
Turkish government He was used
as an emissary to the Arabian tribes,
and for this work probably no man is
better qualified. As he speaks the
dialects of all the Bedouin tribes,
knows their customs and has em
braced the Mohammedan faith, be
wins confidence wherever he appears
in the world of Islam.
After organizing the Arabian tribes
on the Peninsula of Sinai for an in
vasion of Egypt this strange man
went to Damascus and decided to visit
Medina.
Accompanied by tour Arabs he left
Damascus in June. After his train
passed Maan and El Ulla the Turkish
officers with whom he traveled became
distrustful and they even kept aloof
from him when they saw him say his
prayers like every pious Mohamme
dan. When he reached Medina, the
Ramadan, the great Mohammedan tea
tival, had Just begun. He placed him
self under the 'protection of a promi
nent native who has charge of the pil
grims from the Sudan and his host
conducted him to the Harem-es-Sheri
fa, the temple where Mohammed is
buried with his favorite daughter Fa
tima and his son-in-law.
When he stood before the crypt of
the prophet the German traveler was
Burrounded by an angry mob. His po
sition became quite critical until two
Arabians made their way through the
crowd and declared
"We know him; he Is the effendl of
Omdurman and Assuan, a good man
and true Mohammedan."
Even this did not entirely satisfy
the mob and Doctor Neufeld was only
permitted to stay In the temple after
he affirmed his faith with a solemn
oath. For two or three weeks be was

CARLOAD OF HAY FOR 50 CTS.
Mistake In Telegraphic Message Costs
German Farmer Large Sum
of Money.
Hamburg. Through a most unusual
legal ruling, which, in many quarters,
is attacked as incorrect, a farmer has
been obliged to sell a carload of hay
for two marks (50 cents). He had
telegraphed to his would-be customer
that the price would be 200 marks,
and some employee of the telegraph
office lost the two ciphers in handling
the message. The astonished cus
tomer lost no time in accepting the
"2" mark offer. When the customer
declined to pay 200, the case went in
to court. The supreme court decided
that the imperial telegraph office can
not be held responsible for the mis
take and that the sale must stand.

found that the Arabs are especially
bitter against the British, because the
English government has closed tha
Red sea and stopped the great an
nual pilgrimages from Egypt and
India ta Mecca and Medina. Still mora
bitter were the Mohammedans over tha
fact that the English have proclaimed
the new ruler of Egypt appointed by
them "saltan of the two holy places,"
because all of the faithful insist that
this title only belongs to: the caliph at
Constantinople.
'By their attempt to establish am
Egyptian caliphate the British hava
made one of their greatest mistakes,"
Doctor Neufeld said on his return ta
Constantinople. "The Arabs will never
