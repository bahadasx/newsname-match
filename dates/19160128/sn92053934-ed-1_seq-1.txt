PREPARE FOR
WORSETIMES
President Sounds Keynote of j
Western Campaign in His I
New York Speeches.
CHEERS GREET WORDS
Audiences Show Approval
of Stand Leaves Tonight
on Speaking Tour.
Xew York, Jan. 2S. President Wil
son returned to Washington early to
day leaving a message to Americans
to prepare for a time when the Inter
national relations ot the country may
not be so bright as today.
Frankly admitting his change of
mind on the preparedness issue within
the year, he called on Americans to
insist on a body of 500,000 trained citi
zens who will serve as a national mil
itary reserve immediately available
under conditions of danger.
His utterances? here were regarded
u expressing the keynote of the pre
paredness campaign throughout the
middle west on which he starts late
today. He spoke before the Railway
Business association, before a gather
ing of 700 clergymen and at the ban
quet of the Motion Picture Board of
Trade.
"I cannot tell you what the interna
tional relations of this country will be
tomorrow," said the president at the
railway business association banquet.
"And I use the word literally. And I
would not dare keep silent and let
the country suppose that tomorrow
was certain to be as bright as today."
Applause greeted his assertions that
"I always accept, perhaps by some im
pulse of my native blood, the invitation
to a fight" and that while America
stands for peace, its people are "ready
at any time to fight for the vindica
tion of their character and their
honor."
Suffragists who attempted to obtain
from the president a promise to sup
port a woman suffrage amendment to
the federal constitution, were disap
pointed today by their failure to elicit
anything more than a reassertion of
his opinion that the suffrage issue
should be settled by the states.
Not the least interesting phase of
the president's visit was his speech to
the motion picture board of trade,
where his outspoken comments on
"liars" and their efforts to deceive him
as to the Mexican situation and
the
expression of his views of men who I
attempted to "humbug" him stirred his
audience to laughter.
Busy at Washington.
Washington, Jan. 28 President Wil
son returned from New York at 7:15
m. today. He went immediately to
tt White house.
The president planned a busy day
finishing up pressing public business
Prior to departing tonight for Pitts
burgh and the middle west to deliver
speeches on national defense. He is
nxious that the "speeding up" pro
wsb in congress be well under way

The president, it was said, will not
mince words in discussing the need
for national defense and will talk
Plainly about opponents of prepared
ness and men who want a very large
standing army.
The president saw several senators
nd representatives on legislative
Questions but the usual Friday cabi
net meeting was cancelled. He ex
Dwted to see Secretary Lansing, how

LOUIS BRANOEIS
IS SELECTED TO
SUCCEED LAMAR
Washington, Jan. 28. President
Wilson today selected Louis D.
Brandeis of Boston to be associate
Justice of the supreme court to- suc
ceed the late Justice Lamar.
Mr. Brandeis' nomination went to
the senate today. It was a surprise
everywhere in official circles. Mr.
Brandeis had not even been mention
ed for the vacancy.
Mr. Brandeis is a lawyer who has
been much in public life during the
last three years. He is a Kentuckian
by birth and is 60 years old. He was
born and educated in Louisville and
later attended Harvard university.
He came most notably before the
public six years ago through his par
ticipation in the celebrated Ballinger
Pinchot investigation in congress in
which he was counsel for the forces
which sought Secretary Ballinger's
removal from otlice. Later he was
counsel for the shippers who opposed
the general increases in freight rates
before the Interstate commerce com-
mission and he was at the forefront of
those who were demanding an investi
gation of the financial affairs of the
New Haven railroad.
Among his participation in other
public affairs was his appearance as
counsel for those who fought for the
validity of workingmen's hours of
labor law in Oregon, Illinois and
Idaho. In 1910 he was chairman of
the board of arbitration which settled
the New York garment makers' strike,
and has written largely, and is re
garded as an authority on public fran
chises, life Insurance, wage earners
insurance, scientific management, la
bor problems and the trust question.
He also has been at the forefront of
the Zionist movement In the United
States and will be the first Jew to sit
on the bench of the supreme court.

Grave Anxiety Felt in Eng
land Over Fate of Large
British Liner.
COMMUNICATION FAILS
Effort to Locate Boat by
Wireless Futile One of
Life Boats Found.
London, Jan. 28, (10:05 a. m.)
Grave anxiety is felt regarding the
British steamship Appam, which left
Dakar for Plymouth on Jan. 11 with
166 passengers and 134 In the crew.
When about four days out wireless
communication failed. A dispatch to
Lloyds says that the British steamship
Tregantle reports having passed at
sea on Jan. 16 a life boat with the
name Appam painted on the stern
and the bow knocked away.
Concern has been manifested re
garding the fate of the Appam many
days overdue on a 10-day trip from
Dakar in the French colony of Sene
gal, West Africa, for Plymouth. In the
insurance market hope was nearly
abandoned and it was difficult to effect
reinsurances even at the high rate
of 75 guineas per cent.
Other Steamships Overdue.
Two or tHee other steamships com
ing In the same direction as the Ap
pam are also overdue.
Among the 166 passengers on board
the Appam were colonial officials.
A report from Lisbon recently an
nounced that mines bad been dis
covered In the Bay of Biscay. "
The life boat with the name Appam
painted on the stern reported by the
steamship Tregantle was passed by
that vessel in the latitude 33.24 north,
longitude 14.32 west.
The Appam, 425 long and 57 feet
beam, was built in 1913. She was
owned by the British and African
Steamship Navigation company.
ARE FIGHTING, NOT
ASKINGFOR PEACE
Berlin, Jan. 28, (by wireless to Say
ville). Among the speeches delivered
in Berlin yesterday in celebration of
Emperor William's birthday the utter
ances of two men have attracted par
ticular attention.
Adolf Wermuth, lord mayor of Ber
lin, said:
"The emperor and the German peo
ple will find in peace their best re
ward for active perseverance. But we
do not long for peace. The enemy
started out with the purpose of de
stroying the countries in the heart of
Europe. Whenever the enemy aban
dons an effort on account of defeat, he
claims an immortal place of honor in
history. Whenever the central powers
conquer new territory their enemies
refer to our despondency. Therefore
our country does not talk of peace,
does not yearn for peace, but fights
and works for peace."
Professor Schaer, a Swiss citizen,
said in an address that neutrals must
agree responsibility for the war rests
not on Germany, but on the entente
allies. He concluded his remarks by
proposing cheers for Emperor Wil
liam. New Haven Suit to Continue.
Boston, Jan. 28. The supreme court
today virtually empowered minority
stockholders of the New York, New

Battle With
Great Flood
in Arkansas
Little Rock, Ark., Jan. 28 Hun
dreds of persons are homeless and
have asked for aid and thousands of
acres of land are Inundated In the
lower reaches of the White and the
Arkansas rivers. Up stream, with the
Arkansas four miles wide at Mulberry,
is a volume of water which river men
believe will cause the worst flood in
25 years when it pours down stream
and into the overflow that is backed
up because of high water in the Miss
issippi. The Board of Commerce of Little
Rock met today to devise plans of aid
ing the sufferers near Watson, Ark.
Five hundred families, driven from
their homes by high water, are suffer
ing for food and supplies there.
Thirty thousand sacks were rushed
to the state convict farm at Cummins
where 500 convicts were set to work
fixing the main levee.
With the reports of high water came
also the information from Mulberry
that a heavy rain and wind had done
considerable damage to residences,
gins and oil mill plants.
SHARPPROTESTIS
MADE TO BRITISH
ON MAIL SEIZURE
Washington, Jan. 28. Great Brit
ain's interference with neutral mails
is the subject of a sharp protest on
the part of the United States in a note
to the British government, the text of
which was published today.
The communication discloses that
diplomatic and consular dispatches
have been treated by British officials
in a manner regarded by the United
States as "vexatiously inquisitorial,"
which practices are denounced as, "un
warranted interference."
The note also cites repeated seiz
ures of mail in violation of interna
tional law and challenges Great Brit
ain's jurisdiction over mails over ships
touching British ports.
Attention is called to the fact that
"a strong feeling is being aroused" in
the United States by the loss of val
uable letters, while foreign bankers
are refusing to cash A'merican drafts
because they have no assurances that
drafts are secure in the mails.
Ambassador Page at London has
been instructed to make vigorous rep
resentations to the British foreign
office and press for a prompt reply.
Great Britain's tentative reply, made
public with the text of the American
note, promises without "unnecessory
delay" to give the results of a consul
tation that is in progress between
Great Britain and her allies regard
ing the policy to be pursued.
POLICE CAPTURE
CHICAGO BANDITS
AND THEIR BOOTY
Chicago, Jan. 28. The five bandits
who held up the Washington Park
National bank yesterday, escaping
with $15,616, were captured today, ac
cording to the police.
A woman betrayed them, the police
said. Most of the stolen money, which
was found packed in a pasteboard box.
was recovered. Eleven persons four
women and seven men have been
taken into custody.
The stolen money was thrown from
the window of a room in which the
robbers were found while detectives
were pounding on the door, demand
ing admittance. A newsboy saw a
pasteboard box fall at his feet, and,
kicking it open, ten and twenty dollar
bills flew all over the street.
J. Garland Stahl, known in the base
ball world as "Jake," identified the
money. Stahl, a former major league
club manager, is vice president of the
bank.
Identification of "Eddie" Mack, an
alleged pickpocket, and four of the
men with him on the police raid on
a west side apartment, was made by
Mr. Stahl. Mack, the police say, was
the leader of the bandits. Three of
the bandits, Aleck Brodie, Harry
Brandt and Harry Fein, the police
say, are from New York. The Chi
cago detectives knew little of them
beyond classing them as friends of
Eddie Mack.
While the prisoners were being ques
tioned in the state's attorney's office,
counsel for Mack made several futile
attempts to obtain a writ of habeas
corpus for his client The state's at
torney informed the judge that he
wanted more time in which to investi
gate the charges and the petitioned
, writ was denied,
BRITISH LIST
OF DEAD FOR
MONTH LIGHT
Casualties of Great Britain
During January Are Far
Below Average.
REPORT BY ASQUITH
Premier Announces Total
Cost of War in Men on
All Fields of Battle.
London, Jan. 28. Premier Asquith,
in a written reply to a request for in
formation says that the total British
casualties in all fields of operation up
to Jan. 9, were 549,467, of which 24.122
officers and 525,345 of other ranks.
The winter's inactivity on the fight
ing lines is reflected in the compara
tively light losses of the British dur
ing the last few weeks. The previous
official British report, made by Premier
Asquith on Dec. 24, gave casualties up
to Dec. 9 at 528,227, showing a loss in
the intervening month of 21,240, or 685
daily. During the heaviest fighting
British casualties have run far in ex
cess of this average. They amounted
to 60,000 in the battle of Loos alone, in
a period of two weeks last fall. The
monthly average from the beginning of
the war is about 32,000.
The British losses in the month pre
ceding the period covered In today's
report were still smaller. The total
from Nov. 9 to Dec. 9 was 17,997.
The casualties were distributed as
follows: Flanders and France:
Officers. Other ranks
Killed 5,138 82,130
Wounded 10,217 248,990
Missing 1,691 52.344

OFFICERSMAY BE
COURTMARTIALED
Washington, Jan. 28. Court martial
of the three American army officers
Lieutenants Peyton, Mort and Wald
ron who led a detachment of soldiers
into Mexico to rescue two comrades
who had been captured by armed Mex
icans near Brownsville, Texas, prob
ably will result if an investigation
proves that they violated orders not
to cross the international boundary
line. In that case, it was said also
that they probably would be held re
sponsible for the death of the four
members of the rescue party who were
drowned in the Rio Grande while re
turning from the expedition.
Secretary Garrison, who is awaiting
the outcome of the investigation, said
that positive orders had been given
army officers not to cross the boundary
line without instructions from Wash
ington. Prompt action on the part of the
Carranza authorities in returning the
two captured American soldiers, un
harmed, was regarded here as indica
tive of a desire to prove their inno
cence and to show good will toward
the United States.

THE WAR TODAY
More than a half million casual
tics have been suffered by the Brit
ish forces so far in the war. The
official figures giving the total np
to Jan. 9, made public today, place
at 549,467 the number being made
up of 24,122 officers and 525,345
men.
Operations which may have an
important hearing on the Balkan
situation are taking place in Al
bania. The Austrlans anl' Bul
garians are making the most of
what appears to be their present
opportunity to overrun the coun

government.
The British labor conference,
after yesterday adopting resolu
tions against compulsion, but de
clining to countenance agitation
for the repeal of the military ser
vice measurelest the government
be embarrassed in its prosecution
of the war, today placed itself on
record for revision of the muni
tions act. The resolutions on the
subject voiced a protest against
the war being made a "pretext for
greater coercion and subjection of
labor." The conference approved
the action of the executive com
mittee of the labor party In parlia

London dispatches reflect anxi

British steamer Appam of 7,781 '
tons with 166 passengers on board,
bound from the French Senegal to
Plymouth and many days overdue.
She was routed to pass through
the Bay of Biscay, in which mines
were recently reported to have
been discovered. Other steamers
on the same route also are over
due. While fighting Is going on both
along the western ' and eastern
fronts, no direct engagements are
reported.
In the west near Neiiville the
Germans claim to have taken six
hundred yards of trenches from
the French. The French assert
that the Germans were driven
from mine craters they had occu
pied and were repulsed in trying
to recapture them. The Germans
suffered serious losses in a fight
for a mine crater in the Argonne
region, according to the French
report.
From Riga to East Galieisi, on
the eastern front, fighting is in
progress, but no decisive battles
have been reported by either the
Russians or the Teutonic allies.
In the Balkans, on the Austro
Italian front and in the Caucasus
region comparative quiet prevails.

trenches on the land side of Kut-El-Amara

SEEKING TO SAVE
FOREST REGIONS
Washington, Jan. 28. To urge "a
measure of economy" the adoption of
the proposed appropriation in this
year's agricultural bill providing for
the continuance of purchases ot 'na
tional forest lands in the southern
Appalachian regions and in New Eng
land, representatives of nearly 200
forestry and conservation bodies ap
peared at a hearing today before the
house committee on agriculture.
The plan was to urge the commit
tee to recommend that an item of
$10,000,000 be carried in the bill, to
be available at the rate ot $2,000,000 a
year, which would enable the purchase
of three or four hundred thousand
acres of mountain woodland each
year, to be developed for timber pro
duction, watershed protection and
public recreation ground,
PLAN TO LOCK
PORTSTOALL
ARMEDGRAFT
General Agreement Sent to
Belligerents Explaining
Action Taken.
TOUCH ON SUB POLICY
Foreign Powers Asked to
Regard Principals of Law
and Humanity.
Washington, Jan. 28. The United
States in asking all the European bel
ligerents to make a general agreement
to conduct their submarine warfare
In accordance with the principles of
humanity and international law, has
taken the position that under changed
conditions of naval warfare, merchant
ships should carry no armament what
ever. All the powers have been notified
that unless they subscribe to Buch
principles, armed merchantment will
be denied entry to American ports ex
cept under the conditions which ap
ply to warships.
Such a proposal now in the hands of
the belligerent governments has been
transmitted in a note which proposed
that:
First: A noncombatant has the
right to traverse the high seas in a
merchant ship entitled to fly a bel
ligerent flag, and rely on the rules of
international law and the principles
of humanity if the vessel is approach
ed by a belligerent war vessel.
Second: A merchant vessel of any
nationality, should -not be subject to
attack until the belligerent warship
has warned her to stop.
Third: Any belligerent armed mer
chant vessel should promptly obey
any order from a belligerent warship
to stop.
Fourth: No merchant vessel should
be fired upon unless she attempts to
flee or to resist by force and even In
such case any attack upon her by the
warship must stop as soon as the
flight or resistance ceases.
Fifth: Only in case it should be im
possible for military reasons for the
warship to supply a prize crew or to
convoy the merchant ship Into port
will she be justified in sinking such
merchantman and in that case pas
sengers and crew must be removed to
a place of safety.
Submarine Defenseless.
The note is understood to have con
tended that the submarine is almost
without powers of yense beyond the
ability to submerge to escape an
enemy. A gun even of light calibre
on a merchant ship successfully could
defend her against a submarine.
Therefore, the note continues, there
can be no reason for the maintenance
of even small calibre guns on mer
chant ships unless it is designed to
make them superior to submarines
and thereby deprive that class of war
ships of their undoubted right with
safety to warn and search such mer
chantmen. In reality, therefore, any
such armament of a merchant vessel
now might be regarded as offensive
armament.
If submarines should be required to
stop and search merchant vessels be
fore attacking them and to remove
the passengers and crews to places
of safety it is not fair that the sub
marines should be compelled to ex
pose themselves to destruction at the
hands of merchantmen.
Therefore by a general agreement
among the belligerents, submarines
should be required to adhere strictly
to the present provisions of interna
tional law to stop and search mer
chant ships to ascertain their bellig
erent character, and to remove the
passengers and crews to safety before
sinking them.
