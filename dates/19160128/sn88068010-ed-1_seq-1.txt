CHARITON
RIER
LOWLAUDSOVERFLOWED
Sleet, Snow and Heavy Rains.
Badly Mixed Weather.
Roads Ruined.
The drop in temperature from
12 below the morning of the
thirteenth to 23 above on the
twentieth, has been supplement
ed with all sorts of mixed weath
er. Some mornings cold as kraut
and by afternoon shirt-sleeve
temperature-two or three days
as fine as sunny Italy in times of
peace and touring and the bal
ance of the time, night and day,
either raining, drizzling or sob
bing and the snow and sleet
melted and poured into the
streams, altogether forming a
combination calculated to perpet
uate the synonym of Missouri
. weather for denoting a general
mixture. . -For
a week the roads leading
to towns thru the bottoms have
been bad or worse and now im
passable, except by boats, and
four horses being required to
pull a wagon and driver if load
ed, more horses in proportion.
The territory south of Salisbury
is said to have been more exten
sively overflowed during the
past week than at any time in
years, and the bottom lands
north of that city have not suf
fered bo much as they would but
for the ditch which has been
working overtime and overca
parity. The same is true of the
bottomlands east and south of
this city, tho water is still rising
south of the railroad and if the
rain which set in Wednesday
keeps up we will have an unus
ual flood in that section . as. well
as west of town. .
Grand river has been gorged
west of Triplett, hence the
water stage at Brunswick bas
not been so high as it otherwise
would have been, yet the pros
pects are for a heavy overflow.
Floods in our neighboring
states have been great in many
sections and thru Kansas, Okla
homa and Texas high water has
done much damage and seriously
interfered with . traffic. . It is
feared that railroads will be put
out of business generally if
there is not a let up to rain fall
or alternate freezing and thaw'
ing.
Monday the thermometer reg
istered 80 below in Wyoming and
the weather bureau informed us
that a part of the cold would
reach us by Wednesday. On the
contrary, Tuesday evening pre
sented some threats ot a cold
wave but by midnight it was
warmer than ever and raining a
little later on.
Mayor Right
Mayor Agee was right in lis
: tening to the appeal of those who
clamored for the enforcement of
the Sunday closing law. The or
dinance is on the book and those
who felt aggrieved by its infract
ion had a right to complain and
the Mayor has nothing else to do
but enforce the ordinance or
make a big bluff at enforcement
If this or any other ordinance
is obnoxious, unnecessary and
damaging to the business of the
town, wipe it off the book and
go after those who abuse their
" privileges in the other way.
Federal Aid For Roads
Congress passed the bill appro
priating $25,000,000 for public
roads Wednesday. States wil
, now have to take action in order
to secure their quota.
Except an ex-preacher -St.
: Louis congressman, who is suing
his wife for divorce because she
' is not up to his standard since
he became a national lawmaker.
as she claims, all the Missouri
delegation supported the appro
priation. .
Mayor's Grist Mill
The week has been unusually
full of cases demanding the at
tention of the mayor and he has
come out of the judicial business
with considerable credit to him
self,
There are several ordinances
which should ba taken from the
book containing the rules for
governing the town, because
they are not enforced in many
instances and when an attempt
to enforce them is put under
way, there is general objection.
If the ordinances are not there
to be enforced, they should be
got rid of, the latter suggestion
preferable in some cases to the
enforcement.
The lid was lifted Sunday by
several and the chief police got
them and nothing further re
sulted, as predicted, for the
reason that the strict enforce
ment of the Sunday closing
ordinance is not popular among
merchants and customers as a
general rule and discriminates.
Since there was no prosecution
of the few who took chances and
sold some of the necessaries of
life, such as cigars and cold soup,
etc. we refrain from giving
further data.
Grant Hurt Jr. did not regard
a dare that he ride his horse on
the sidewalk on main street as
being beneath his acceptance and
fell a victim to the ordinance
against such wild west proceed
ings to the tune of $2.50 and
costs Tuesday night.
Arlie Rain3 was charged by
the city collector with having
failed and refused to pay city
jicenae on two automobile livery
rigs he had run before the run
ning was bad, and Raina. plead
not guilty and stood for a jury
trial Tuesday, the result being
that he was liberated, it being
disclosed that the ordinance was
was null and void. He had paid
on one term but that money was
gone.
U. R. Westlake was charged
also by the city collector with
having failed and refused to pay
the city license for a year on his
converted antedeluvian Maxwell
flivver which he had been operat
ing as a delivery, pleasure and
music vehicle for a longer time
than he had paid due3 on, was
exhonerated and the amount he
had already paid refunded, $2.50
in hard cash.
James Rucker and Mossy Clos
son were charged with racing on
the streets. There was a differ
ence of opinion as to which could
get there and back the quicker,
and they "cut loose" in the north
section of the city to show the
speed of their superior steed.
Result, stakes go to the city in
the amount of $2.95 each. Jinks
Jenkins bad been riding one of
the horses until it dumped him
in the presence of Rucker who
avowed he could stick the charg
er and beat the Closson horse in
a race. This challenge and ac
ceptance enriched the city.
Difference In Men
Human nature may be revealed
in many ways. There stands on
the street a crowd of boys, hold
ing the ropes on their sleds and
waiting for a chance to "hook
on." A vehicle approaches, the
driver sees the boys, divines their
object and gives whip to the
horse or turns on more gasoline
and robs the boys of a great
pleasure. Another man approach
es the same group. He stops
and tell3 the the boys to "hook
on.V My, what a scramble for
position. , He waits until all are
ready and will then go a mile or
two out of his way just to give
the boys a "joy ride." Mendon

OUR XLVI ANNIVERSARY
CHARITON COURIER HEARING HALF CENTURY
First Always in -Progressiveness,
Aggressiveness and
Fearlessness
VHILE the volume number does not indi
cate the date at which the first paper wa3
printed in this 'town, it does show that
so far back there were predecessors who started on
its historical career, that which developed into
what the Courier represents at the time of this
issue. From the Keytesville Union in the middle
sixties, with William Maynard at the head, to the
present day, the paper has broadened with the
advance of business and other interests.
William Maynard, some, short time after the
war, opened a print shop on the premises now
occupied by Thos. T. Crews' residence near the
court house, afterwards moving to the little frame
house on the block now owned by James J. Ward.
Maynard sold to Bogie & Huuter, of Huntsville,
about 1873 and they to William W. Jones about
1876, the paper having changed its name under
Bogie & Hunter to The Key tesville Herald. Judge
O. F. Smith was the edito under Jones and lie
called the Herald "the true democratic paper."
Wm. Jones sold to J. A. Hudson in 1878 and he
to Vandiver & Collins in 18S2. Max Collins re
tiring, establishing a paper at Mendon. The pub
lishers of the Chariton Courier, the name given to
it by Hudson, became A. C. Vandiver fc Son, who
were succeeded about J.PS3 by C. P. Vandiver,
who, together with J. A. !-iadson, gave the paper
the reputation which it had of being the best pa
per in north Missouri. C. P. Vandiver died in
October, 1910, from the effects of a murderous
assault and his widow and step daughter took
charge and conducted the business successfully for
about six months, when the plant was sold to
E. E. Rettig, who, in June 1911, sold to E. B.
Kellogg. Kellogg sold a half interest to J. A.
Larison in September, 1912, and in October, 1915,
Larison sold his interest to Kellogg.
The notable incidents in the history of the pa
per occured under its ownership by Bogie &
Hunter, when the policy of the paper was made
more aggressive, from a political standpoint ; un
der J. A- Hudson more progressive, from a busi
ness view, aud under C. P. Vandiver, in every
particular. The present owner will let his succes
sor, some time' in the 2000"s, say in what respect
he lent distinction, if any, to the paper that has
stood at the head iu the county during the greater
part of its existance.
Entering on its forty seventh year, if any moss
is observed on its back, it will be democratic ; if
anything which its readers should be advised of
comes within the kuowledge of its editor, they
may expect to see it published ; if any species of
crankism bobs up, it will be denounced along with
hypocracy and any other form of superficial "I am
better than thou" pretentions ; if the interest of
the city, county or state can be advanced, the edi
torial and other columns of the Chariton Courier
will be open for as much as they can be made "worth
to the cause, and if there is any other good pur
pose which it may be made to serve, it will cheer
fully lend a hand. In prosperity it will rejoice
with its friends and in adversity cheer them with
optimistio views of the better time coming.
Why are red heads almost al
ways a badge forinflamable tem

friends Tuesday afternoon with
cards
The appearar.ce of the Ruth
ville Bee was very much improv
ed the first week Editor Child
made it up. Secretary Roach's
picture and ". democratic record
were on the first page.
One thing a new paper will do
at Brunswick, and that is liven

Geo. Herman of Salisbury was

Salisbury Scribblings
Another old land mark. The
old frame Dickson hotel is a
thing of the past. The last of
its kind on Broadway to go; it
went Monday morning by ihe
fire route. Those who respond
ed to the fire alarm saw the
flames devour the old shack with
mingled feeling of regret and
hope regret for the loss and
hope for a more worthy success
or. It was remodeled many
years ago and became famous in
its day, but yielded to rivals of
brick and stone as time wore on.
All the department could do was
confine the flames to the doomed
building, and save what it could
of the contents. There was
$1000 insurance on the building
and $300 on the contents which
will partially cover the loss.
The building belonged to the E.
C. Dickson estate, and will not
be rebuilt by the estate, but be
ing one of the best locations in
town for a modern hotel, we
hope it will not be long until
someone will buy the lots and
erect thereon an ornament to the
city in the way of a hostelry that
all can and will appreciate.
O. P. Ray was over Friday on
business, but failed to look in on
us. This should not occur again
O. P.
J. W. Tuder and family of near
Shannondale have moved to Kan
sas City where they will make
their future home. Mr. Tuder,
for the present, will assist his
son in manufacturing an electric
smoothing iron that is said to be
a success.
Saturday was a pretty day and
the old fashioned crowd was in
town. It makes one feel like
old times to see the people come
flocking in at the end of the
week.
Elder E. M. Richmond of Mo
berly passed thru here Saturday
on his way to Shannondale where
he preached on Sunday.
Mrs. J. W. Dameron was call
ed to Clifton Hill Sunday to at
tend the funeral of her mother.
On the sick list Mrs. Arnold
Baier, Mrs. Sutter, W. C. More
dock and Miss Mary Bean.
Dr. J. D. Brummall drove off
a water covered bridge, Monday,
and had a thrilling escape.
Mrs. Joe Sims has been spend
ing a few days with her daugh

ponds for the Democrat, and is
a fine news gatherer.
At a called meeting of the
city council, Tuesday night, P,
C. Simmons was appointed city
marshal, vice W. J. Atteberry
resigned. It will be remember
ed Mr. Simmons came within a
few votes of election, 'a year ago,
and this with a big petition made
his case certain.
Dr. J. F. Welch made a busi
ness trip to St. Louis the first of
the week.
Minter C. Moredock of St
Louis is here on a visit to his
father who remains seriously ill.
Gus Wangler was taken to

A. C. Gilchrist of Tul-a, Okla.,
one time marshall of this city,
and a good one, was here the first

President Wilson and Mrs.
Wilson will leave Washington
February 2 for a look at some of
the country on the west side of
the Mississippi and breakfast in
St. Louis and make an address
on the morning of Feby. 3. The
road over which he will travel
has not been named, nor has it
been said whether he will appear
on the rear of his car at points
between St. Louis and Kansas
City, but it is fair to presume
that he will. The high water
along the Wabash and the dang
erous track at several points may
force north Missouri to lose the
honor and pleasure of his pre
sence, but it is for him, just the
same.
40th Wedding Anniversary
Mr. and Mr3. D. J. Holman
celebrated their fortieth wedding
anniversary at their home Tues
day, January 25th 1916. Mr. and
Mrs. Geo. C. Schupbackand son;
Mr. and Mrs. James A. Holman
and children; Mr. and Mrs. Jas.
C. Jenkins and daughter, and
Mr. and Mrs. G. N. Hyde and '
daughter; Misses Lorena, Frances
and Ernestine Holman and War
ner Holman of Key tesville; Mr.

handsome Elgin gold watch and
chain surrounded by seven $2.50
gold pieces, and a sterling silver
pie knife.
Daniel J. Holman and Hattie
Davis were married in this
county Jan. 25, 1876, Rev. Har
vey Hatcher performing the
ceremony, at the old homestead
four miles north of town. All
the children and grand-children
except daughter of James A
Holman were present at the an
niversary. Mis3 Helen White
was a guest.
Will Revise Ordinances
The city council has under con
sideration the revision of the
city ordinances which were dis
covered to have at least one big
hole in them thru which culprits
could slip.
If some of the ordinances are
revised out of the book and oth
ers modified so that they can and
will be enforced all the time, it
will be decidedly better than to
have a big bunch of them which
are not enforced at any time.
There is too much lawmaking
and too little stability in a lot
that is made, this remark apply
ing to acts of the legislature and
congress as well as city councils,
don't you think so?
The contention made a few
years ago by some of our city
dads that we would have more
money with less coming in has
lost by sad experience, but un
der any conditions brot about by
those with losing business con
ceptions, we must have revenue
to keep the municipality going,
and it is up to the council to so
regulate the tax burden that it
will bear proportionately on each
and with a little discrimination
as can be arrived at
Fulton Dry
At the local option election in
Fulton Tuesday the dry won by
178, the total vote "being more
than 1100.
There are two saloons in the
city of colleges and other infirm

ness Feby. 11, and stay out in

much more than it does here.
