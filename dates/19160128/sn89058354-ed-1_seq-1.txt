THE PARISIAN SCOOPS COMPETITION ON RE
PEAL OF COUNTY ROAD LAW
I A news item that has set all Henry county talking and
which may result in a long legal controversy and court trial,
was that of the unintentional repeal of the Henry county
road law, which appeared in The Parisian last week.
I This story did not appear in any other Henry county news-'
paper last week, and was not published in the dailies for
many hours after The Parisian had placed it in the hands of
its subscribers throughout Henry county.
Q If there is any question in which the people of Henry coun
ty are deeply interested it is the road question. The Parisian
got the story in regard to the repeal of the law and gave it
to its readers before they could read it in any other paper.

One of the largest crowds ever

here. Many brought mules which
they offered for sale. Several
sales were made, it is understood,

Public Shows Much Interest In
Probable Change of Pres
ent Road Statute
COMMISSIONERS MAY ASK
APPROPRIATION OF COURT
Early Session of Board To Dis-1
cuss Matter Is Probable;
Lawyers Disagree
Members of the county road
commission, as well as the pub
lic generally, are up in the air as
a result of the publication in The
Parisian last week of the facts
in connection with the probable
unintentional repeal of the road
law, under which the commis
sioners have been serving, and a -special
session of the county
court for the purpose of appro
priating funds to defray the ex
penses of a test case to the Su
preme Court is considered , like-
If the law was repealed by the ..
passage of the act intended for
Robertson and Haywood ' coun
ties the road commissioners do
not wish to expend any more
money on road work when they
have no authority to do so.
It is understood that members
of the bar disagree as to whether
or not the Robertson and Hay
wood county act repeals the Hen
ry county statute. While it is
said that there nas been a deci
sion by the courts affecting a
similar case, The Parisian has so
far been unable to locate the de
cision in question.
Since the publication in The
Parisian last week of the story
in regard to the road law matter
the question has been almost the
sole topic of discussion wherever
a number of people may gather,
and especially among those, who
live in the rural districts.
It is probable that the mem
bers of the road commission
would have a meeting at once
and carry the matter to the
courts were it not for the fact
that should the case be decided
in favor of the repeal of the law,
the commissioners as individuals
would be responsible for the
costs of the litigation.
One member of the commission
who was in Paris some days ago
expressed himself as being
strongly in favor of testing the
matter in some court, but did not
know just what steps would be
taken in regard to the question.
As all of the commissioners re
side outside of Paris The Pari
sian's representative was unable
to get into communication with
any other members.
A question in regard to matter
the is as to whether or not the sup
posed road authorities can force
those who have been warned in
to report for road duty, when
there are probably no road offi
cials in the county.
It is impossible to forecast the
final result of the tangle and it
will probably wind up in the
courts sooner or later. '.'.,'
