CATTLE STEALING FLOURISHES
IX KEITH COUNTY
The cattle stealing Industry In Keith
county has again begun to flourish
with the result that ovor thirty head
imve been stolen within the last three
monhs. The sheriffs of Hox llutto
and Keith county have. one man In Jail
at Alliance now on suspicion, which
may yet uncover the gang that is op
erating up there with assistants in
Keith county. Strong suspicion is nl-
rndy being cast ' upon one resident
of our "county who has always hereto
fore borne a good reputation. Mr.
Arch Scale went to Alliance Monday
night to recover six head of their cat
tle found up there. It is thought thnt
the eleven head stolen from the Thai
ken ranch went a different direction
than Alliance nnd the officers still
have hopes of getting a clew to these
cattle. Keith County News.

The Cost of Win- Supplies.
A Washington dispatch dated yes
ter day says:
The estimates were riven the senate
military committee today by Briga
dier General Crozier, chief of ordnance,
showing that a plant costing $400,
000,000 operated by a force of 750,
000 workmen would be required to
mavdtnclure ammunition and war ma
terials necessary to keep an army of
1.0UU.00C men In the field and equip
an additional 1,000,000 recruits.
General Crozier strongly disapprov
ed any proposal for government mo
nopoly of the manufacture of war sup
plies, insisting that best results coind
I " accomplished by relying upon pri
"site establishments to supplement the
output of the government plants in
time of war.

of several weeks the result jf an at
tack of pleurisy when the constitution
had been weakening for a year or
more, and later trouble of a pneumonic
nature developed.
In his death North Platte losses one
of Its most valued citizens, a man
who was a consistent clfrlstinn, for
many years one of our most progres
sive buslnes men, nnd one whom tho
people honored by electing to the po
sitions of county commissioner and
mayor of the city.
Mr. Horshey came to Lncoln county
from Lancaster, Pa , In 1879 and as
sumed the management of the L. W.
ranch In Cottonwood precinct. This
position he held for about eight years
when he enme to North Platte and as
sociated himself with John llollinan
in the hardware and implement busi
ness, which ho continued after the
death of Mr. Hollman, and which he
discontnued but a few molnths ago.
A good man has passed on nnd many
are tho friends in city and county who
will deeply regret his passing.
Arrangements for ihe funeral had
not been completed up to the hour of

Field Manager Urynn for tho Anier
lean lleet Sugar Compnny Informs us
thnt Sutherland may not havo quite
enough beet acreage to securo a beet
dump this year. Ho states, however,
that he has written the Denver office
regnrdlng the matter. Four hundred
acres aro required to secure n dump
and but three hundred acres is about
all ho will be able to contract for In
thnt neighborhood.
Mr. Uryan also says that the factory
has limited the acreage in this terri
tory to 3,000 and by the end of the
week he will havo that amount writ
ten up and he has not nearly supplied
all with contracts who wish them. He
has not yet visited tho Keystone or
Mnxwell territories.
The factory will contract 0,000 acres
In their various districts this year and
this territory will supply one-third
of the beets. Uoyond a question of a
doubt it will bo necessary for Mr. Rry
an to ask for an additional thousnnd
acres in this territory and when the
season ends the North Platte district
will, In all probability, have supplied
the Grand Island factory with about
half the beets they will use. The
beets raised In this irrigated section
contains the greatest amount of pur
ity and aro the most desirable. Hor

Sicwnnl Sniilh Serves Hip Supper
The losing team In the recent bil
liard tournnnient at the Elks' home
were hosts -to the winning team nt a
supper served in the buaquet hull last
evening at seven o'clock. Eighty men
took part in the tournament and all
but two surrounded 4ho two big tables
and were served with a splendid sup
per by Stcwrird Smith and a lialf doz
en assistants. The menu was pre
pared by Mrs. Smith and it was cer
tainly a good one; In fact practically
every Elk sould not resists In making .u
gourmand of himself. Roast pork nnd
bacon, baked potaloDs, b'lwe:! beans,
cabbage salad, white and brown
bread, pickles and olives, mlnco pie
and peaches and cream disappeared
with wonderful rapidity before thnt
hungry horde of hearty Elks. A testi
