INFANT CHILD
During Ab of Mother, Unknawn
Ma poisons Child.
New York, Jan. 2S. A stranger,
whose motive mystifies the police,
yesterday forced arid down the throat
of a fonr-v.teks'-old baby a.' it lay
(n a go-cart on the sidewalk. The
baby died today. Its mother, Mrs.
Charles Clement, had stepped into a
store for a moment, when the poison
ing took place. The man disappeared.
Rainfall
LAST NIGHT IS CON
INTO SNOW AND
VERTED
SLEET WHEN WIND SHIFTS TO
NORTH.
Watch your step:
This was the warning heralded
from one side of the streets to the
other this morning as people endeav
ored to walk on the slippery side
walks. Last night, rain began falling
lit about nine o'clock and the wind
shifting to the north, soon converted
this into sleet, which covered the
ground to a depth of two inches in
some places.
Tliis morning the city streets and
sidewalks were a perfect glare of
smooth ice that made walking dan
gerous. Several corpulent persons
were noticed in a very humiliating
attitude during the early morning
hours, but fortunately for them, the
only Injury sustained was to their
I dignity. It was practically impos
sible for horses to be used on the
streets of the city until after the
noon hour, and those who ventured
forth
had to discontinue their use
until the ice melted.
Wheat growers state that tills
sleet and snow will he good for the
grow ing crop, and. as the acreage has
been materially increased in Carter
county, it will bo worth several thou
sand dollars to Ardmore.
JEWISH RELIEF DAY
Ardmore Response Was Generous,
Considering Efforts Made.
According to the effort made to
raise funds for the Jewish war zonj
sufferers in Ardmore, the response
was very liberal. At the Westheimer
& Laube store, where most of the
fumta were sent, the collection was
$12.). There are many persons in
Ardmore who are willing to help in
the work, and. inasmuch as funds
leave here every month to be used
for this purpose, the people can
give at any time they desire to do so.

the Westheimer & Daube store wi'!

No Ti-ne For D!ay.
New York, Jan. 2S. President Wil
son last night opened his personal
appeal to Hie country for national de
fense. He gave warning that plans
for the readjustment of the army
must be formulated and carried out
without delay, and solemnly declared
he could not predict that the outlook
for the I'nited States would be as
bright tomorrow as today. Speaking
iit banquets of the Railway Business
association and the Motion Picture
Hoard of Trade, he sounded the key
note of addresses that lie will de
liver during the next ten days in
the middle west.
Mr. Wilson was in a fighting mood
throughout his address. In a speech
delivered earlv in the day he de
clared he always accepted an invita
tion to fight. Last night he told the
railway men he was an advocate of
peace and had struggled to keep the
I'nited States at peace, but consider
ed the liberty and honor of the na
tion even more important than peace.
"Woe to any man who plays the
marplot or who seeks to make party
politics or personal ambition take
precedence over candor, honor and
unselfish, unpartisan service," said
the president in speaking of his de
fense plan before the railroad men.
He declared that the country expects
action; this is a year of accounting
and the accounting must be definite
on the part of the parties and on the
part of every individual who wishes
to enjoy the public confidence.
'Tor my part, I hope every man
in public life will get what's coming
to him," said Mr. Wilson, amid laugh
ter and applause.
The president at both banquets and
all during his day's visit to New
York was greeted with enthusiasm.
On his ride between the hotels where
the banquets were held tonight he
was escorted by a band and the ninth
command of Toast Artillery of the
New York National Guard. Thousands
of persons packed the streets and
cheen d him as he went by.

SAY3 HIS SON HAS DESERTED
HIM AND HE NOW DESIRES TO
FIND A PLACE TO SPEND HIS
REMAINING DAYS.
A -ad tab- of mistreatment tt the
hamls of an ungrateful son was re
coueted to Mrs. Curtis, probation of
lleer. this mi. ruing, by an old man, 7i'
years of age. who came here to enter
the Confederate Home, but as he was
without credentials, ami had novel
made application, the be.-t that could
he done for him was to keep him
o. I'ei.-'bt and make up a purse for
lliii'i Oils morning and send 1: i it back
'to Arkansas, where he savs he has
iivi d for over twenty years.
The old man, I). 11. Karris, says lie
was a member of the Fourteenth
Tennessee regiment, Col. Forbes, Ar
cher's Ptigade, lleth's division, A. P.
Hill's corps. Army of Northern Vir
ginia, and was captured at I lie battle
of Franklin after having his leg shat
tered by a title ball and retained in
a northern prison until after the sur
render of Lee. He was a resident of
Arkansas, as he states, for over
twenty years, and recently left the
Soldii is' Home at Little Hock, to
travel with his son, who is a vendor
of wire baskets. He stales that the
sou compelled him to work every
day. rcgnrdli ss of the weather, and
at limes when he was barely able to
crawl, that lie maltreated him, and
on several occasions slapped him and
pulled his gray beard. When asked
where his son was, he staled that he
believed ho was in Oklahoma City,
but begged not to be sent to him if
he was located, as he could stand
no further abuse at his hands. The
son, he said, was 2'.) years of age,
and capable of making a good living,
if he would do so, for both of them.
When the old man was recounting
his tale or abuse, Mrs. Curtis casually
re'iierked that she would like to get
a rm grip on "son"; that there
would lie something doing.
Mr. Harris, the superintendent of
the Soldiers' Home here, raised a
purse this morning for the old man
and turned it over to Mrs. Curtis,
who sent the old man back lo Little
Mock, where he will endeavor to es
tablish his record and enter the
home again.
"I hope the officers all over Okla
homa will keep a lookout for a man
peddling wire baskets and coat
racks." said Mrs. Curtis, "and if they
find a man answering to this name,
give him what, he deserves, regardless
of law or license. A young man who
would deliberately treat his father
as tils old man says he has been
treated by his son, ought to be made
to suffer here the rest of his natural
life, and then turned over to a power
higher Up."
The old man was started on his
journey hack to Little Hock this af
ternoon. ALABAMA BANK CLOSED
