NORWAY REALIZES
LARGEST PROFITS
Cash Per Capita Doubled in Year and
Half; Great Revival in Ship Building;
Expect to Become Second Mari
time Nation in World
By CHARLES P. STtlWART.
(United Pren Staff Correspondent.)
COPENHAGEN, Jan. o. (By Mail.)
Scandinavia is enjoying a tremend
ous war boom. It is more or less com
mon to Sweden, Denmark and Nor
way, but so far as appearances go, it
i3 most pronounced in Norway. Swe
den has sold to the belligerents, es
pecially to Germany, immense amount3
of raw and finished products, includ
ing war munitions, though these lat
ter sales were not countenanced by
the Swedish government. Denmark,
being separated from Germany only by
an imaginary line Instepd of a stretch
of mined and dangerous water, has
done still better. The lion's share of
the war business, however, has gone to
Norway.
The Norwegians have profiled, to
some extent, like ' Sweden and Den
mark, by sales of their own goods to
the belligerent nation", especially to
Germany, but it has been as middle
men that the bulk of their business
itas been done. Norway was the world's
third maritime nation when the-war
broke out. England ranked first, Ger
many second. England still ranks first
but even the British mercantile marine
lias suffered! heavily from tho destruc
tion incidental to war. Germany's mer
chant shipping has teen out of com
mission altogether since the early days
if hostilities. This was Norway'3
chance.
Comparfed with Norway, America's
war boom has been a small affair. This
Is speaking relatively, of course. In
actual dollars and cents the European
struggle unquestionably has brought
more money to the United States than
to any other country. Comparatively
Norway has been the bigger gainer
That is, the Norwegians are richer by
the struggle to the extent of about
00,000,000 in actual cash thus far.
To properties they already owned
there has been added a value of ap
proximately as much more This is
jn a basis cf a population of 3,r00,000.
An addition of $80 per capita to
Norway's wealth in a year and a half
lias been felt emphatically. It has
meant a boom fuch ns the old world
aas not seen hitherto in historic times.
Millionaires have been created whole
sale. Many of them are millionaires
only in kroner akroner b?ing in the
neighborhood of 27 cents but a jump
from nothing in IS months to a fortune .
of $250,000 to $270,000, which has hap
pened in hundreds of cases, is not so
tad. The big old shipping firms
have profited in actual millions of dol
lars. The newly made millionaires in
Norwegian nuuey arc mainly mere
clerks in shipping houses, or woiking
officers ot ocean-going craft who were
able to command a little credit and
branched out in business - for them
selves. Numbers of the newly-made mag
nates have never owned a ship. Thev
have bought vessels '.n course of con
struction or invested merely ia char
ters and have been able to transfer
either their unfinished craft or their
thailers, so rapid was the increase in
the demand for bottoms at huge ad
vances, sometin.es in the course of no
more than a few days War taxes have
been high, but profits have been so
much higher that the taxes have hard
ly been felt The Norwegians count
on being the world's second maritime
power when the war ends. Only Eng
land, they belie.e, will lead them.
Neither do tbey believe their boom
will burst with the struggle's end.
Shipbuilding, with the exception of
warships, has been practically at a
fclandstill since fighting began, they
point out. This means, they say. that
the supp.y of vessels has not been
