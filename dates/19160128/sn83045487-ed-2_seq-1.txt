Accidents.
"When you pay a penny for a trust
paper there are a lot of things that
you don't find in it. Every loop pa
per has its pets and protects them.
With hundreds of autos and wag
ons passing daily through the loop,
there are accidents. If the accident
concerns only ordinary citizens it is
printed in full by the trust press.
But when a concern which adver
tises, or a newspaper, or a fender
less auto truck happens to figure in
the smashup or the running down of
a pedestrian nothing is said about it
Three times in the past week
newspaper wagons have mixed in
crashes in the loop. The DailyTJews,
according to police records, has fig
ured in two accidents; the Tribune
in the third.
Police records show that a Daily
News delivery wagon hit George
Scherrard, 14, of 4026 Jackson blvd.,
at 5th av. and Madison st and that
he was brushed from a street car.
Yesterday a wagon of the Daily
News crashed with the wagon of
Theodore Zemesteen opposite 401 S.
