NEAPOLIS ASKS $15,000 DAM
AGES FOB ALLEGED INJURIES
Miss Bessie MeCreedy of Minneapo
lis, formerly of this city, was here on
business Wednesday in connection
with a damage suit for $15,000 which
has been started against the Northern
Pacific Railway company for injur
'ies which she alleges she sustained in
October, 1910, as the result of falling
on the platform near the N. P. station.
Miss McOreedv alleges that she sus
tained permanent injuries to the left
arm and the- left anlde, as the result
of falling on the platform. The fall
was due to the rough condition of the
platform, at that time, she charges.
The case is to be tried about the first
of .Tune in the Hennepin county dis
trict court.
Lpcal people know Miss MeCreedy
very wfcll as she lived here for several
years with her parents. Mr. MeCreedy
was before his removal to Minneapolis
proprietor of the Columbia hotel on
Second street northeast.
VERNDALE FAVORS GETTING
CURRENT FROM THIS CITY
T. C. Gordon returned Wednesday
from Verndrue, where he addressed a
mass meeting of citizens the previous
evening in regard to a proposition of
furnishing that village with electric
current for light and power purposes.
The gathering was very favorable to
the plan and will no doubt accept it
but are waiting to see what action
XiOng Prairie takes in the matter.
As planned by the Water Power
company, they wish to run the current
from here to Long Prairie, thence to
Vera dale, Wadena and several other
towns in thiit vicinity. If the towns
where the proposition has already been
made, act favorably, they will proba
bly do so before March 1 and the work
of constructing the line will begin im
mediately afterward.
The company does not intend to run
the line in a sort of circle to return
here via Randall, as was recently re
ported, but may at some future date
build a line to Randall to furnish
that village with current.

^Ground Hog Day and all will hope
that it will be cloudy then, because
should the groundhog come out from
his lair and see his shadow, he would
return to his abode in the ground to
sleep on for another six weeks, know
ing that the cold weather would
continue at least that long. On the
other hand, so an old legend tells us,
if the day is a cloudy one the ground

COUNCIL FAILS TO ACCEPT BID
FOR REPAIR ON NORTH WAG
ON BRIDGE
A short adjourned session of the
city council was held Wednesday eve
ning for the purpose of receiving
bids for the repairing of the north
wagon bridge. Alderman Hall, Moeg
lein, Blake, Murphy, Peterson and
Bell were present.
Two bids were received for the re
pairing of the bridge, one from Wm.
O'Shea & Son of Minneapolis for
$2397 and one from the D. D. Bidwell
Company of Hazelton, N. D., for
$2550. The first named bid also pro
vided for a- charge of $12 per thousand
feet for repairs not specified in the
plans and specifications, plus the cost
of material. The city engineer's esti
mate was $1921.06.
Wm. O'Shea, who was at the meet
ing, explained that the reason the
bids were so much higher than the es
timate was because the estimate on
certain joists called for in the plans
had not been included in the city en
gineer's estimate and that this
amounted to about $211. After some
discussion it was decided to leave the
matter until Monday evening of next
week, when another adjourned meet
ing will be held.
W. O. Beat'tie WP.S granted a license
to sell cigarettes in his restaurant on
First street northwest.
The street committee was instruct
ed to make investigations concerning
the installation of a private sewer
for the new government postoffice,
which is to be erected here soon, and
the committee was asked to report at
the next meeting. S. P. Brick, local
postmaster, recently received a letter
from the architects in charge of the
preparation of plans and specifica
tions for the new postoffice, asking
that the city pass an ordinance grant
ing the government an irrevocable
license or ensement for a 6-inch sewer
to be laid on Broadway in front of
the site, said sewer to connect with
the regular Broadway sewer. City
Engineer Randall stated that if an, or
dinance should be passed granting the
government what is asked for in the
letter to the postmaster, trouble might
arise in later years should other busi
ness buildings be erected on the north
side of Broadway and sewer connec
tiins be asked for by the owners, as
the private sewer would be in the way
of another. The street committee
was asked to look the matter up and
adjournment was then taken to Mon
day evening.

130 BUSINESS MEN PARTOOK OF
FINE DINNER AND HEARD
GOOD TALES
Our Commercial club on Monday
evening held one of the biggest and
best get-together dinners in its his
tory, at the Buckman hotel. The at
tendance exceeded one hundred and
thirty and every line of business was
represented. An excellent six-course
dinner was served.
Frank Kiewel, president of the club,
made an excellent toastmaster.
He first called upon F. W. Dobbyn,
superintendent of the public schools
of this city, who gave a very interest
ing talk on the growth of Little Falls
in the past five years. The increase.,
in the banking business in this cicy
alone is evidence of the growth of tha
city, he said. The total increase was
a million dollars, of which one-half
was in deposits. The surplus also has
shown a large gain.
The amount of building construction
during the past five years has •lsb
been remarkable, he said. Approxi
mately $370,000 has been spent on thje.
construction of business blocks and on
the new concrete dam. It is estimat
ed that more than one hundred
new dwellings have also been con
structed in that time and the approxi
mate cost of these is $200,000, making
the total amount spent in this city
the last five years for construction,
$570,000 over half a million. Thiis
is more than one-third of the assess
ed valuation of the city. Mr. Dobbyn
stated that the assessed, valuation of
the city is entirely too low, in fact
it is no larger than it was five year
ago and less than it was a year ago.
Of interest to- the hearers were fig
ures given by Mr. Dobbyn on the bus
iness of one manufacturing concern
which started in business here lesjs
than five years ago. This concern fe
Sylvester & Nichols. They did a tfih
tal business amounting in all of $76f?
000 in 1915 .but this was lower thali
for the previous year, owing to tlfji
discontinuance of one jobbing lint,
tobacco. They manufactured 44,00©
pounds of candy last year, as well
thousands of pounds of, butter as|i
thousands of gallons of ice cream.
Along educational lines Little Falls
has taken rapid strides during the
past five years, Mr. Dobbyn pointed
out. He mentioned the local business
college as one of the biggest and best
in the entire northwest, having an en
rollment of over 150 each year. Th«
public schools offer more and greater
advantages. Five departments have
been added during the past five years,
for which $4,200 state aid is received,
making a total of $13,000 aid secured
from the .state each year. The attend*/
88 pear -cent.- .'"
The county fair association* has
been reorganized and is now a very
healthy organization. Grounds have
been purchased and exhibit buildings
erected at a cost of several thousand
dollars.
The freight business has increased
considerably, showing that there has
been an increase in the manufacture
of the various products.
A new white way has been installed
which is the best outside of the twin
cities, Duluth and Hibbing.
A new $5,500 fire truck has been
added to the fire-fighting apparatus of
the city, by the Firemen's Relief as
sociation. Thirty Dlocks of water
main have also been laid.
The Water Power company has
greatly increased its business, having
made 50 extensions for current in this
city and having added Royalton and
Pierz villages to its list of consumers.
The Northwestern Telephone com
pany has more than doubled its busi
ness.
Five years ago there were many
empty business buildings in fthe city,
as well as empty residences. Today
all are filled that were empty then and
others have been added.
Mr. Dobbyn closed with the words
that Little Falls had enjoyed a good,
steady, substantial growth in the past
five-years and that it is continually
growing. Soon we are to have a new
postoffice, a national highway, and
paved streets, he said.
John S. Ebersole of the extension
division of the state university was
next introduced. Mr. Ebersole wjas
the principal speaker of the evening
and his subject was Prices and the
High Cost of Living."
Mr. Ebersole explained that there
are three ways to view the problem
of the cost of living. First there is
the money cost, second the cost of la
bor and effort, and third the psycholo
gical cost, or the pain Of satisfaction.
Mr. Ebersole gave figures to show the
increase in prices, both wholesale and
retail, during the past seventeen
years. Farm products which could be
purchased wholesale Jfe* $78 in 1896
cost $165 in 1913* Clothing which
cost $91 in 1896 epst $223 in 1913.
The increase in the price of lumber
also was phenomena]. Retail prices
showed increases of from two-fifths to
two-thirds on farm produce, clothing,
lumber, etc. At this rate the man with
a salary of $1,000 in 1896 should haye
a salary of $1,860 in 1913, the speaker
said.
A great tidal movement in price in
crease is now on. The increase is uni
versal except on one or two commodi
ties. This tidal move has a certain
effect on the individual, owing to. fix
ed prices. There are three ways or
fixing prices, viz.: by law, by contract
and by custom. Salaries of teachers,
etc., are fixed by contract the salaries
of laborers and others receiving a day
wage are usually fixed by custom and
the prices of public service corpora
tions, etc., are fixed* by law. There
fore the tidal move has two effects:
those who have a fixed income get less
and those who have a flexible income
get more.
Mr. Ebersole classified the business
men into two distinct groups, the ac
tive and the passive. The active
strive to increase their business and
even borrow money to promote enter

INTERESTING GAME OF BASKET
BALL PROMISES TO BE STAG
ED TOMORROW NIGHT
Aitkin high's basketball team and
the local high quint are scheduled to
clash at the local high school gymna
sium tomorrow evening, the game to
be called at 8 p. m.
The up-state quint has always been
a strong contender tor the district
title and did win it one year, and
the local boys look for a real strug
gle. Our boys are anxious to get in
on the state tournament at Northfield
this year, however, and you can be
sure they '11 put in their very best ad
forts to win. They will have the ad
vantage of the visitors of being on
their own floor, on which they are ac
customed to playing.
prises of worth. The passive sit back
and depend on the ambition of the
"Other fellow, supplying him with the
ijioney, etc. These passive business
men have lost while the active men
have gained.
The monetary system has something
to do with the high cost of living al
so, the speaker said. Could the pro
duction of gold be so monopolized
that the value of money would be
changed as the market fluctuated, the
trouble would be overcome. This idea
is impractical, however, as are many
others which have been advanced by
scientists.
"If prices are raising, are your
wages increasing proportionately?,"
he asked. He expressed the belief
that there would be no trouble if they
did. The question is whether the
Am­
erican people are working less or eat
ing more. A careful comparison of
the consumption of foods in the Unit
ed States for thirty years., shows that
there has been a marked increase in
the consumption of wheat products,
corn meal, sugar, coffee, distilled spir
its, malt liquors and wine, while tea
and raw wool have been one the de
cline during that time. As a matter
of comparison Mr. Ebersole stated
that there had been a decrease of 4
per cent in the number of wonting
hours, an increase of 31 per cent in
wages and a raise in prices of 45 per
cent, but the conditions are really not
as bad as the figures would make them
appear. Also there have been added
the various conveniences of housing
and of heating, lighting, etc. Com
parisons have proved that conditions
are much worse elsewhere. A commit
tee from England found, through in
vestigations in the twin cities, that
wages were 130 per cent higher in thi3
country than in Europe and that
prices were, 54 per cent higher.
Ebersole for getting more for our ef
forts. These were to produce more,
to improve the system of distribution
and to use less. He did not advise
practicing the latter way, however,
but instead, suggested that more be
used. To help in producing more he
stated that technical training should
be encouraged and the patent laws so
fixed as to increase inventive effort.
"We are just in the beginning of in
vention," he said. As a means of
improving the system of distribution,
and reducing cost, if one-half of the
population of the east would move
west, the cost of freight would not be
so great. Domestic science has also
begun to play an important part in
the matter of improving distribution,
by reducing waste and making the
small amount go further.
The effect that the war has on the
cost of. living in this country was also
shown by the speaker. The European
countries that are fighting, in order
to carry on this great struggle, are
manipulating the currency system.
England has circulated nearly a half
billion in currency, France has circu
lated a billion, Germany^ a billion, Rus
sia a billion, Italy a third of a billion
and the Scandinavian countries fifty
million* making a total of nearly sev
en billions of dollars in new currency
put in circulation Bince the war start
ed. The was has affected the United
States by increasing the circulation of
money in this country a billion dol
lar^ in 1915. The increase in check
circulation last year" was 623 million
dollars., The reserve funds in the cen
tral banks of the country was a half
billion dollars and one-billion more is
on deposit than a year ago. "Has
this increase had any effect on the
prices?," the speaker asked. He pro
ceeded to give figures to show that it
had. In England, in June, 1914, just
before the war broke out, a certain
list of commodities could be purchased
for $25. In December, 1915, this same
list of commodities could not be pur
chased for less than $35, which was
an increase of 40 per cent in a year
and a half. In June, 1914, a certain
list of commodities could be purchased
in this country for $8.42, whereas in
January, 1916, it would cost $10.91.
This was an increase of about 26 per
cent in a year and a half. This in
crease will continue if the war keeps
on, especially if it continues to in
crease steadily. Should it increase by
jumps, however, it is not likely that it
would continue, the speaker stated.
On the other hand, if the war should
stop, prices might go down, but. this
is not certain.
In closing Mr. Ebersole urged the
business men to get into the active
class and to speculate in their own
business and not in the business of
others.
President Kiewel then announced
.that a short time would be devoted to
$ve or ten-minute talks by local busi
ness men. Only one responded to this
invitation, he being R. B. Millard,
the club secretary, who gave a talk on
the Jefferson highway, which is rout
ed through this city, but which Long
Prairie, Sauk Centre and other towns
in the western part of the state are
trying to get changed. Mr. Millard
explained the matter, saying that a
fight was on in regard to the route,
but that Little Falls wants the high
way and. ,' fis going to get it.'?

LITTLE FCTLS AND OTHER CIT
IES TAKE STEPS TO KEEP
JEFFERSON TRAIL
If the state highway commission,
which is acting as the state board of
directors of the Jeffersonian Highway
commission, remain firm, in their be
lief that the route of the highway
through this state as chosen by fhem
is the best, and there is very little
doubt that they will not, Little Falls
will remain as one of the cities
through which it will pass. But in
order that all doubts be removed, a
large delegation of business men rep
resenting the cities, towns and vil
lages along the proposed route from
St. Cloud north went to St. Paul last
Wednesday to wait on the commission,
and urge that body to stand pat on
the originally chosen route.
The reason fop this action is that
three other routes have been proposed
by other towns that are anxious to
get the highway. One is through
Stearns county from St. Cloud to
Sauk Centre,
Loner
Prairie and tlienee
north. The second is to run the road
through Princeton, thence due north
to Mille Lacs lake, following the east
shore of the lake, thence to Brainerd
and on north. The third is to Alexan
dria and thence through the Red Riv
er alley.
A late dispatch from St. Paul states
that the highway route matter was
taken under advisement bv the high
way commission, after hearing the ar
guments pro and con. A decision will
probably be rendered within a short
time.
At a meeting of representatives
from all towns along the proposed
highway from Sauk Rapids to Park
Rapids, held at the Buekman hotel
in Little Falls Monday afternoon, the
matter was discussed and it was de
cided that each town send at least
one to three delegates to St. Paul to
meet with the state highway commis
sion on Thursday (yesterday) and
urge them to leave the route as select
ed. Six towns were represented at
the meeting Monday and all were very
enthusiastic about the highway and
believed every effort should be made
to retain it. The following gentlemen
were present: Frank Kiewel, George
Kiewel, R. L. Palmer and R. B. Mil

in full:
The State Highway Commission, the
State Board of Directors of the
Jeffersonian Highway Commission.
Gentlemen:
Your letter of December 31 has been
acted upon by the Commercial clubs,
Auto clubs and county commissioners
along the Jeffersonian Highway as es
tablished by you from Sauk Rapids
through Little Falls, Staples, Wadena
and Park Rapids. Steps were at once
taken to ascertain the oad spots
along the highway in our respective
localities and to complete preparation
for fixing them as soon as spring
opens, and to improve the entire high
way in our respective localities.
At a mass meeting of the citizens
of Little Falls, held January 24, dele
gates from all civic and county organ
izations along the route of the Jeffer
sonian Highway met and appointed a
committee. The committee wishes to
go on record as follows:
We wish to assure the commission
of our earnest support in making this
highway one of the best, and we fully
appreciate the fact that the commis
sion has used its best judgment and
engineering data in selecting this
route, influenced by no other consider
ation than that of giving the, public a
splendid scenic -highway through cen
tral Minnesota along the Mississippi
River valley.
Mileage—It is the most feasible,
practical and direct, almost an air
line from, St. Paul to .Wadena, then
directly. north to state park, nearly 25,
miles nearer than any Other route.
Population—Several thousand great
er than on the old route.
Hotel and Garages—Good hotels and
garages in every town along the route
and towns every few miles.
Railroad Facilities—By following
the route as established. Can better
accommodate tourists from any point
along the railroad.
Boil—Good road-making material,
assuring good roads at all times, at a
minimum cost of making and main
taining
Scenic Advantages—Following the
Mississippi River valley to Little
Falls then entering the beautiful lake
and park region of northern Minnesota
up to beautiful Itasca state park.
Only Highway—The Jeffersonian
National Highway is the only one go
ing through this part of Minnesota.
We the delegates from the following
towns and cities along the established
route of the Jefferson Highway wish
to express our appreciation of the
splendid work of our state Highway
Commission and assure them that we
are fully determined to make and
maintain the highway that runs
through our Tesp^ctfive .localities so
that it will reflect credit upon your
good judgment in choosing it.

ON ICE TRACK ABOVE BRIDGE
MANY HORSES WILL BE
ENTERED
With favorable weather predominate
ing at that time, some good horse
races promise to be pulled off on the
river track Sunday afternoon, begin
ning at about 2 o'clock. The races
were to have been held last Sunday
but were put off. There will be no
second postponement, however.
•Sam LaFond's pacer, which now
holds the record in this territory, wilL
be expected to defend his title against
several other fast horses, one of which
has been brought here very recently.
This one is Pat Crol, owned by Burton
& Greisch. The big event will no
doubt be the race between these two
horses. Although the latter horse
has not been entered in a race here
before, it is said that its speed is
marvelous. LaFond, however, has
many supporters who believe that his
horse will retain the title.
Others who will have their horses
on the tracks Sunday are Louis Bois
vert of South Little Falls town, Na
poleon Cota, John Hanson and Dr. E.
A. Hall. Other owners of fast horses
from outside of this city may also
compete. The horses probably will je
placed in three classes. The LaFond
and the Burton & Greisch horses will
be in the first class, and it is possible
that the Cota horse will also be en
tered in this class. Boisvert, Hall and
Hanson will probably race in the sec
ond class. The races will affotd some
real sport and promise to draw a large
crowd if the weather is favorable.
