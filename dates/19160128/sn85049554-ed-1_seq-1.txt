Chicago, Jan. 28.—When the steam
ship Grafton Hall, southward bound for
the Argentine coast, dropped anchor
last night at the Barbadoea islands a
dingy containing officials of the port
came alongside and two of the passeng
ers were taken ashore.
They were Edwin Lynn Thacker, ab
sconding cashier of Cosden & Co., at
332 South Michigan avenue, and his
wile. Neither knew their whereabouts
had been discovered until the ship of
ficers notified them they were wanted
by the port officials. The long arm of
the wireless had notified the ehip'4~ of
ficers of Thacker's alleged forgeries.
While the couple paced the decks of the
liner three Indictments were returned
by the grand jury before Judge Burke.
One indictment charges forgery alone
to the extent of $302.48. The amount
in the second indictment charges for
gery, confidence game, and obtaining
money by false pretenses, ls 1,000. The
