TAXPAYERS
ALL. TO VOIGE PROTES I
AT BOOST OF VALI
- Taxpayers by hundreds streamed into city hall today and
stormed about the office of the assessors. They had come to
protest against increased valuation of their property, and to find
out that there had been no clerical errors before they take steps
to appeal to the board of relief. ..
Some of the visitors were large property owners, but most
of them were owners of small homes. All had come under the
sweeping program of raising the taxable valuation on property
that theadministration may keep up a semblance of economy by
keeping the tax rate below the enormous propostions neces
sary, if it were based upon the present tax values.
Notices of the increase . in assess- ,
merits were sent out yesterday 0 all
taxpayers." They, responded with, a
rush today, everyone to examine the
books and raise objection, but As
sessors Khowlton and O'Brien, who
were the only officials present this
morning took the matter coolly. The
board of relief will work overtime for
several weeks if they hear - all the
complaints for relief. '
' Clerk Delbrldge has not been in the
assessors' office in the daytime all this
week. President Hughes is ill at his
home in Washington avenue and has
not been at the office for three days.
The ' abstract of the .grand list is not,
ready and. not 1 one of the assessors
wiU venture a guess as to how large
the 'total increase in assessments will
be. ' . y
,'There are the books; you can look
over them." said Assessor O'Brien,
when asked this morning what the tor
tal grand list might be. Clerk Del
bridge alone might venture a guess
but he has been in hiding aU week.
It was the intention of the adminis
tration to boost the grand list at least
$25,000,000. thinking thereby that the
tax rate might be kept at about IS

City Auditor Keating points out in
his preliminary report, .however, that
even with' this gneat increase in the
grand list a tax rate of 20.7 mills will
be required to meet the city's needs.
It was predicted by some property
owners at city hall today that many
of the Items which City Auditor Keat
ing has' cut from the list -will be al
lowed by the board of apportionment
and recommended by the . advisory
board and therefore the tax rate is
likely to be more than 20.7 mills.
The stream of property owners who
came to see why their assessments had
been raised continued unabated this
afternoon. . ,
"It's an outrage," declared one man
who owns two houses on which the
assessment has been increased $1,000.
"You ought to give them h 1 in.
the papers tonight-"
This general Increase in property '
valuations will be probably followed
by a general increase In rents all over
the city and especially rents for
dwelling houses. ' Such . rents are al
ready at "war time" prices but a
further increase seems Inevitable to
some of the landlords. "'. . ,
HATTERS' FUND
III BRIDGEPORT
EXCEEDS $5,000
Remington Arms :y 'Machin
ists Pledge Donation of
.' J MoreJChaflK -
More than $5,000 will be donated by
Bridgeport union men to the relief of
the , Danbury , hatters,' aocording to
what axe said by union leaders here
to be' conservative estimates.
A canvass, of unions indicates that
thousands of dollars have already been
and will be contributed before the end
of the week. '
Those - who are working piece work
give the proceeds of the second hour's
labor yesterday. Day workers have
and will make flat contributions of 50
and 60 cents.
- Nearly-, all the unions have held
meetings on the matter, and the mem
bers agred to assist the struggling
hatters. As a result, they ratified , as
sessments of 50 and 60 cents or the
proceeds of the" hour's pay. '' ' '
The union machinists of the Rem
ington Arms & Ammunition Co. have
just received sanction for a local of
their, own. They will branch out from
Local No. 30 and will forrh a larger
one. They alone have ; pledged an
amount that undoubtedly 'will exceed
$500 and will be nearer $1,000, prob
ably The -original local, with its
Bembera other than Remington em
ployes, will give at least J500. The
carpenters probably will give $500, the
musical union men, $200, the printers,
$100, the painters, $200. The plumbers.
who . have almost . tripled their mem
bership, probably will raise about $250.
The number of corset workers in the
city exceeds 1,000 and is less than
2,00OV according to . estimates. Contri
butions from these and from the many
other unions in the city will bring the
total far past $5,000, it is thought.
More than $1,000 has already been
sent out of the city for this purpose.
There are 35 unions in the city, and
ino majority or tne memDers were
benefitted by the union principles last
summer. '
According to union men, ' it Isn't
possible to estimate the number of
members the organizations have in
Bridgeport.'-' They know it exceeds
10,000, but are not sure if it reaches
15,000. With 10,000 only contribut
ing, together ' with Bridgeport train
men, railway clerks freight handlers
and others not affiliated with the Cen
tral Labor union, the , contributions
are erpected to be great. ,
The second, hour's pay was selected
by tlun . piece workers - because they
know they earn more in that hour
than in any other during the day.
This, it is believed,, is caused by cir
cumstances that make them generally
slow in l be first hour. They may come
to work late, get started late, or take
time to "get warmed up" or "hit their
stride," and the second hour, if de
voted to making up the resulting de
fieiency, besides turning out the sec
ond hour's natural quota
Organized labor throughout the
United Statr yesterday was' expected
to do the same as Bridgeport. The
homes of the hatters of Danbury are
about to be sold under the hammer

a bathroom window." Asked if she
had called the police she replied:
"Yes, an officer nearby."
She admitted that she knew , Chief
of Police Crowley of Newport
. "Haven't you entertained him at
your home?" Mr. Rice asked.
"Mr. and Mrs. Crowley have been
to my ' house several times. Mrs.
Crowley was a very good friend of
mine."
"Weren't you intimate with him?"
"No."
The alleged confession of the ne
gro co-defendants, stated that Mrs.
Mohr told them not to be afraid as she
"stood in" with the police.
The "witness said the "first serious
quarrel with the doctor occurred in
February, 1909. It started, she said;
when he began taking drugs and beat
ing her.
"I understand you to (say he drove
you out of the house?"
"Yes, I told him I was going to leave
him."
"There was no occasion for the
beatings other than that he got drunk
and used drugs "
"No, sir." '
Certain questions relating to an
insurance policy taken out by Mrs.
Mohr on the life of Joseph Hennon,
her ' nephew, and litigation that fol
lowed, were excluded' by the court.
Mr.-RIee explsiVied. that he was try
ing itoi .show that the trial of the In
surance suit was . postponed several
times and -did hot come up until after
the second v marriage ceremony at
Lynn, inv1909. - !
"Didnt you know- that in that suit
you had to testify you were the wife
of Dr. Mohr?"
"I don't know anything labout it."
"Didn't you go to; Lynn to have the
marriage ceremony performed for the
express purpose of . enabling you to
testify in the Insurance suit that you
were Elizabeth F. Mohr, wife of Dr.
Mohr7" ' ,
"Certainly not."
"Didn't yoir take Dr.iMohr to Lynn.
to be married while he was under the
influence of liquor?"
"I did not. - v.
"Didn't Dr. Mohr' always say that if
he ever did marry yoult was while he
was Intoxicated?" ,
"No, sir, because he was. not intoxi
cated when he was married."
"Didn't you know that in this cross
petition for divorce he charged you
with extreme cruelty and adultery?"
"Yes, sir." . ,
"And didn't you know he claimed in
the petition he was' never married to
you?" v
Arthur Cushing, Mrs: Mohr'a coun
sel, objected. The attorney general
showed her the bill and asked her if
she found any allegation there where
Mohr admitted he married the wit
ness. '
"I don't find any,", replied Mrs.
Mohr. ' . " ,
"Have you any further proof or wit
nesses that he admitted his marriage
ti you excepting your word?"
' "My word Is the truth," she replied.
Mrs.. Mohr said that In June, 1909,
the doctor struck her and knocked
her Into the bathtub.
"And after he gave you these terri
ble beatings you still loved him ?"
loved him always," she sobbed.
