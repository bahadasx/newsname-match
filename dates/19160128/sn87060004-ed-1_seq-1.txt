LIVE TOPICS
Discussed
at Boosters Club
Last
l Evening and
'''lafops Taken '
TOWARDS A GLOVE FACTORY
The Boosters" hed ii live wire
meeting last dvenitipr at the City
Hall. Quite a number wero pres
ent nnd look part m the dlecustlop.
The most Importnul matter brought
before the Club was the rending of
a letter from the Work Glove Co.,
of Detroit, Mich., who statod that
they were going to open atiother
branch factory and asked what the
Booster Club could olter them.
They further stated that they woujd.
ouipiuy inun -iu to u Kins, Aim mat
they wero also in communication
with other town?.
This would be a great thing for
oar city it this company can be In
duced to Iocato here, as they would
give employment to a olass of labor
that hV no markot hero unless some
basinets of this character should be
established. This would mean many
hundreds of dollars to be put Into
circulation weekly among our busi
ness men. The Secretary was in
structed to write tbem asking what
Inducements they required as well
as calling their attention to our un
surpassed facilities as regards fuel,
water, power, labor, exemption from
taxations, eto.
Tbe question of the payment of
does was then discussed, and as
many who gave their names for
membership have never paid a cent
of dues, or attended the meetings, It
was decided to call their attention
to this matter through tbe columns
of the Bee. It was further agreed
that all who do not attend or pay by
tbe next meeting night, shall be
dropped from the roll, The idea Is
to ret the membership to attend.
No good can bo "done unless tbo peo
ple are, interested. One or two men
cannot bring these manufactories to
onrclty, il takes cooperation and
sticking to it. AlUIC-lCTltod whetu
or members or not. Tbe Idea Is to
get the people out to tbe meeting,
so they shall know what Is going on
and give their support.
The question of cooperation was
thorougely dlsoussed, with Miller &
Oldham's meal as an oboot lesson.
All the groceries but one carry this
meal In stock, and if people will call
for it every time In ordering meal,
all the stores will carry no other
brands. TIiIb will make prices low
or on produce, etc., from the fact
that the farmers will bring their
produce when thev bring a turn of
corn to mill, as well as bringing
trade to our looal merchant.
The question of the thoughtless
ness of the people In ordorlng groc
eries late in the afternoon, thereby
causing much dlsoomfort aud wear
iness to the delivery boys and hors
es, was brought forward, Madison
ville merchants ceaso delivering at

There is one phase of American preparedness which is pal
pable, pressing and decisive. Nature, which has been most
prodigal in its benefits to the United States, has not been nig
gardly in the responsibilities it imposes for their maintenance
and protection.
Great European ports are protected by sheltering and de
fensive rivers from the sea. London on the Thames and Bre
men on the Weser are fifty miles inland. Hamburg on the
Elbe is 75, Bordeaux on the Garonne 6o, and Antwerp on the
Scheldt 53. Liverpool on the Mersey, Hull on the Humber,
Glasgow cn the Clyde and Rotterdam on the Maas have, all of
them, shore protection, and the security of Constantinople has
been shown in the toll of lives of the gallant men who sought
to force the straits protecting it.
Three great American ports, the three greatest Jin respect
to their importance to commerce, New York, Boston and San
Francisco, are on the sea. Two of the five boroughs of New
York City have shore front cn the Atlantic. Two other bor
oughs, Manhattan and Richmond, are well within the range of
naval guns. The Bronx is open to the Long Island Sound. In
hvo hours' bombardment the matorial damage to New York,
Boston or San Francisco, would amount, perhaps, into billions,
and without the possibility of protection, oxcopt through ade
quate defonsoj
Nature, which protects I he ports of European countries,
leaves to the prescionce and patriotism of men, the safeguard
idg of the three great tidewater ports of the .United States.

Bully For
(Courler.Journal.)
The conviction of three mefl At Greenville, who Were in
dicted for a "possum hnnter" outrage, is a victory of law and
order, which was not won without courage and perseverance,
and lor which Muhlenberg county should be grateful. The cit
izens of Muhlenberg who took part in, or were serviceable to,
the prosecution proved the excellence of their citizenship as
well as the quality of their mettle. Let credit be given where
credit is due.
One conviction where the crime was committed as a result
of organization and because of confidence in immunity, goes a
long way toward discouraging outlawry not only in the county
in which the conviction occurs, but also in the section of which
it is a part.
Muhlenberg not only sets her house in order, but also sets
a rattling good example, when she sends "possum hunters" to
prison for having participated in a cowardly act of violence.
Thare are numerous cases still to be tried. It is to be hoped
that good fortune will attend the efforts of the prosecution in
the cases upon the docket. Every guilty man should be pun
ishel. There should be no disposition to find cause for satis
faction in the successful prosecution of one case.
