Complete Eradication on Oahu
Expected By End of 1916,
Says Norgaard Report
PORK PACKINGPLANT
WILL SOON BE NEEDED
Hog Business Developing on
Islands at Amazing Rate;
Cholera Well in Hand
So decided has been the Improve
went In the situation' regarding bo
vine tuberculosis In the islands Jur
ing 1915 that there is good hope for
the complete eradication of the d.-
sease by . the end of this year, ac
ordlng to a statement made by Ter
ritorial Veterinarian Victor A. Nor
gaard, in his report to the board ot
agriculture and forestry, which held
Its regular monthly meeting this
- morning.
"With the slaughter and segregation
of all the reactors, and with the thor
ough disinfection of all premises
where reactors have been found, it
may. safely be claimed, that at least
90 per cent of the local dairies are
iiow, at the end of 1915, free from
tubercular infection says Dr. Nor
gaard in bis report
"Equally satisfactory conditions can
be reported from the other islands
where the new sanitary code of the
territorial board of health has sup
plied the long needed authority :for
a vigorous campaign against the disease."-
, f '. - '
Eradieati6n Is Surel
According to the veterinarian three
deputies on the other islands are co
operating with the representatives of
the health board In a manner which
is sure to bring about the complete
eradication of the diseased
.'Under these, conditions,- he says,
"the complete eradication of bovine
tuberculosis ,wlil require only the co
operation of r the owners of the few
remaining herds where the infection
still persists in order to be an ac
complished fact by the end of 1916.M
Dr. Norgaard says that the over
production of milk in certain locali
ties is a sure sign that the campaign
has caused little hardship to result,
with the possible exception of con
sumers in the poorer classes.
Will Have to Pack Pork.
So rapidly is the hog business de
veloping that it will not be long un
til pork packing will have to be es
tablished here as a--permanent indus
try, according to the doctor. Already
the increase has caused a lowering in
the price paid, to producers, though
ns yet it has hardly affected the con
sumer. Hog cholera is being well sup
pressed by the aid of serum injec
tions, and Sudan grass Is coming into
prominence for hog feed in pastures.
Swill is valuable for its high nutri
tive properties, though it Is always
more or less dangerous for young ani
Duals. Routine reports were submitted at
the meeting by other divisions as fol
lows: '
Division of entomology, E. M. Ehr
horn, superintendent and inspector;
division of forestry, C. S. Judd, super
intendent and executive officer of the
the board, and David Haughs, nur
seryman; division of hydrography,
George K. Larrison, superintendent.
More Animals Condemned.
One per cent more dairy animals
were condemned in 1915 than in 1914,
as the result of the tuberculin tests

THE POWER OF ADVERTISING
5 (From System 3or January, 1916)
If there are still men who ask the question 4 Does it pay
to advertise ?" I know their thinking is of the kind that would
lead them to light factories with candles and insist upon the
advantages which would accrue if the residents of modern
cities still drew their water supply by bucket from the town
wea ' : . li
When nations in the greatest struggle of histon' adver
tise for annies; when kings and emperors and sultans come
down from their thrones to seek the attention of the world
and present their pleas and defenses through the press; when
it has become the daily bread of a large part of the world's
business, it is indeed a man of limited mentality who still ques
tions the power of publicity. Its value to society has, in fact,
so impressed itself that today publicity is the light of the
world. It may be said, with little element of speculation in the
;.' assertion, that if publicity had characterized dealings between
the nations of Europe during the past 50 years, and secret
diplomacy had been eliminated, the present world war, with
its terrorism and threat to all civilization, would not now be
raging.

LAST FOR YEARS
Ewa Plantation Said to Be Spe
cial Gainer; Level of Artesian
Water is Raised ; . '
Though the heavy rains of the last
month have in many localities serioos-
v damaced Rtandlnr : ratio - havo 'in
some cases washed out whole fields,
and though the excess of moisture is
expected to result in some, deteriora-
uon 01 me juices-TOTnis year s. crop,
the total damage will probably be far
exceeded by the immense benefits
which will be derived from the rains,
and which will total a large round fig
ure. . y ; ;'; '
The mountains are full of i water,
and stream flows which in the past
have proved inadequate for proper ir
rigation in some districts will prob
ably be ample all during the next sea
son. Nature's storage reservoirs are
filled as never before by the deep
soaking of the ground, for though the
floods were excessive only a minor
portion of the precipitation found its
way to the sea in surface flows.
Ewa plantation, say local men, is a
good illustration of how the cane in
dustry will benefit from the rains.
f 1 - . Ml a. A
there the level was about 31.6 feet
above mean sea level. Pumping for
irrigation for many years has gradual
ly lowered this level until three
months ago it has registered a total
loss of about 18 feet, and stood only
about 13 feet above sea level. .
Water Level Is Rising.
On Monday of this week, say re
ports from the plantations, the arte
sian water level had reached the high
est point in years, having gained 13
or 14 feet, and being then only about
five feet below the original level of
31.6. "-vV-.'-V-
Another benefit to Ewa has been
the washing of all the deleterious
salts from the soil. The Ewa artesian
triow is slightly brackish, and this
water flooded over the cane fields
for years, and quickly evaporated by
the sun, has left an alkillne deposit
which, . however small in each year,
has presented a growing problem.
This problem the drenching rain has

VAUGHAN Is"r1aDY FOR
INVESTIGATOR TO COME
Says Former District Attorney
is Making Attack Because
Successor "Made Good"
If Jeff McCarn emerges victorious
from the fight he is now waging on
District Attorney Horace W. Vaughan
In the department of Justice, . will he
seek an appointment to a federal post
Hon in Hawaii and come back to Ho
nolulu "with a brass band and in the
guise of the conquering hero," as one
well-known local attorney stated to
day? -:'
While no quotable statements have
been made for publication bearing di
recently on this question, still this ap
pears to be the belief of several fed
eral officials here who have become
nterested In 'the situation, and - espe
cially since it has been reported that
the department of justice is to send a
special agent i here to investigate Mr.
Vaughan's conduct in office.
General sentiment in the commu
nity seems to be that the fight is be
tween McCarn and Vaughan and that
so long as it continues to be, there
is no reason for Honolulu to revive
the old McCarn animosities.
Several reasons are advanced for
McCarn's wanting to come back to
Hawaii, one being that he Is desirous
of having Mr.. Vaughan ousted and
fthen return, with a federal plum of
some kind, to gloat over what he
might claim to be a personal victory.
While no reasons have . as yet been
advc ced for his attack on the con
duct -f Mr. Vaughan, it is the belief
of bi ine officials that McCarn is ha r-
tjorlng a "petty. Jealousy for the reason
that, when Mr. v'aughan came here,
he immediately proceeded to "make
good" in the position of assistant dis
trict attorney, and that he made in
stant friends-with the members of the
bar and with other persons.
Remembers demons' Fight.
Another report is that McCarn's fail
ure to have Federal Judge Charles F.
demons removed about two years ago
Is still proving a "bitter pill." In 1914,
as the result of an attack made by
McCarn, the department of justice re
quested Judge Clemons resignation.
That was during the incumbency of
Attorney-General McReynolds, since
promoted to the supreme bench. Judge
Clemons went to Washington and con
ferred on the matter both with. Mr.
McReynolds and with Mr. Gregory,

fAssocl&ttd Ptmi by Federal Wireless
WASHINGTON, D. C., Jan. 28.
Louis Dembitz Rrandeis, noted Boa
ton lawyer, author and economist, was
today appointed by President Wilson
as associate justice of the U. S. su
preme court to succeed the late Jo
seph R.Lamar.
The nomination of Mr. Brandeis was
a complete surprise to official circles
as he had not before been mentioned
in connection .with the position. The
names of A. Mitchell Palmer of Penn
sylvania, ex-President Taft, Senator
Ellhu Root and others had been heard
but it was not known that the presi
dent was considering ' Brandeis.
The new appointee was born at
Louisville in 1856 and admitted to the
bar in 1878, taking his law degree at
Harvard. . He . has practised at Bos
ton since 1879 and has won a nation
wide reputation as a brilliant student
and practitioner, . being " particularly
Boston and his appearances before
the Interstate Commerce Commission
and other bodies. He is an authority
on franchises, rates and similar tech
nical subjects.
Brandeis Is the first Jew ever ap
pointed to the u. S. supreme bench.
He is regarded in Washington as an
eminent authority on scientific man
agement and labor trust questions.
He was counsel for Louis Glavis In
the Ballinger-Pinchot investigation
which resulted in the retirement of
Richard A. Balllnger aa secretary of
the interior, and was at the forefront
