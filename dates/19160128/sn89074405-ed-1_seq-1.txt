Question Broached at Open

RICHTER GIVES
HIS ADDRESS
Crary Tells How to Get Ad
vertising—Carlson Gives
Fine Talk.
The question of organizing a state
publishers' mutual Are insurance
company was brought before the
North Dakota Press association, which
opened its annual winter meeting in
this city this morning. E. M. Crary
of Devils Lake asked for permission
to present the subject. It proved of
so much importance that the conven
tion finally voted to have a commit
tee of Ave appointed to investigate the
proposition thoroughly and if advis
able. oresent a plan of organization.
Despite the- uncertainty of traffic
conditions, the opening session of the
convention was quite well attended.
The attendance was materially in
creased'this afternoon after' several,
of the late .trains had reached the
city.
Maintain Bl* Week
At the morning session, E. L.
Richter, president of the association,
read his address, in which he recom
mended that the "Appreciation
Week," which was conducted last No
vember by the press association, be
made an annual event. There were
several other important recommenda
tions, all of which-will'be taken up
later.
J. H. McGarry, secretary at the as
sociation, was. .unable to reach the
city until this afternoon, so that his
report could not: be presented this
morning. This necessitated a brief
change in the program, and the ad
dress of E. M. Crary on-"Home Ad-,
vertising—How to Get It" was shift
ed to the morning session.
Banquet and Danoe.
The banquet and dance tonight are
the only entertainment features of the
meeting. The banquet will be given"

LONG OVERDUE FEAR
Insurance Circles in London Have Aban
doned Hope—166 Passengers-and 143
In Crew—Lifeboat Seen Adrift
London, Jan. 28.—Grave anxiety is felt regarding the
British steamship Appam, which left Dakar for Plymouth
January 11, with 166 passengers and 134 in the crew.
When about four days out wireless communication
with the vessel suddenly ceased. A dispatch from Hull to
Lloyds says that the British steamship Tregantle reports
having passed at sea January 16, a lifeboat with the name
Appam on the stern. The bow of thfe lifeboat was knocked
away. .1-
For several days concern has been manifested in ship
ping circles regarding the fate of the Appam, many days
overdue on the ten day trip from Dakar in ihe French col
ony of Senegal, West Africa, for Plymouth.
In the insurance market hope is nearly abandoned.
Two or three steamships coming in the same direction as
the Appam, also are overdue. Among the passengers
aboard the Appam area number of colonial officials.
The Appam was built in 1913, was 425 feet long, near
ly 8,000 tons gross, and was owned by the British and
African Steamship Navigation company.

of advertising in building up any line
of business,- but eiud that the publish
er must giye the. Advertiser "value re
ceived," else his periodical will do lit
tle good in developing the advertiser's
business. '.
Carlson fSHcite Humor.
C. P. Anderson pf Hatton, was
scheduled to conduct the discussion
on this topic, but be was not present.
I am ISeartit^ in accord with Mr.
Srary," said Mr. Carlsrtn.' "He has
told you -How to run a newspaper with
advertising. I could tell you better
how to run one without advertising.
I am glad to hear Irtm say that news
paper men are getting down to good
solid business methods in running
their papers. Most anybody can be
a politician, but not everybody can
run a paper—-at least in Towner.
"There is no reason why the news
paper men should not be as success
ful as the banker and work as short
hours. I know I am—that is, I work
as short hours."
itr. Carlson also spoke of the im
portance' of the "paid-in-advance"
subscriber.
'When I took over the Towner
News and Tribune," he said, "I made
a list of the subscribers in the coun
ty and sent them a notice saying that
they would have to pay up by a cer
tain date. Some of them did, but oth
ers did not. I dropped their names
and put their bills in the hands of a
collection agency. I don't know
whether the agency collected or not
I haven't heard from them yet."
Mr. Carlson said that there Is' no
reason why the editor of the "country
weekly" should not have his subscrip
tion in advance. He is entitled to It
as much as the publishers of The Sat
urday Evening Post and other periodi
cals. The "paid-in-advance" sub
scription money will enable the editor
to do a lot of things.
In closing, Mr. Carlson said: "It
should be a crime punishable by death
to sell a paper in North Dakota for
less than $1.50."
Mutual Insurance.
Following Mr. Carlson's address,
Mr. Crary presented his plan for a
Publishers' mutual fire insurance. The
association should organize, Mr. Crary
said, for the protection of newspaper
plants only. Later, If deemed advis
able. the company could, broaden and
write fire insurance for others.
Mr. Crary pointed out that the aver
age newspaper is established in a
country toWn without adequate fire
protection and is paying out five per
cent or at least S50 on every $1,000
for protection. He spoke of the mu
tual companies organized by the Im
plement Dealers and other associa
tions.
He pointed out that there are 436
newspapers in the state, -and he be
lieved there ahould be organized a mu
tual fire insurance company. The
larger papers, those published dally
should be eliminated, he thought, be-,
cause they would be too big a load for
.the smaller' weeklies to carry.
These 43fi papers, he estimated, ate
paying out from $20,000 to $25,000 In
premiums for Are protection. There ia

Interference With Neutral
Messages the Basis For
Strong Protest
INSIST IT IS
WITHOUT WARRANT
Contended that the Practice
Should be Abandoned
at Once.
Washington, Jan. 28.—Great Brl
tain's Interference with neutral malls
is the subject of sharp protest on tha
part of the United States in a note
to the British government, the test of
which is published here.
The communication discloses that
diplomatic and consular dispatches
have been treated by British officials
in a manner regarded -by the United
States as "vexatlously inquisitorial."
which practices are denounced as "un
warranted interference."
The note also cites the repeated
seizures of mall in violation of the In
ternational law and challenges Great
Britain's jurisdiction over mails on
ships touohing British ports.
Attention is called to the fact that
"a strong feeling is being aroused in
the United States," by the loss of val
uable letters, while foreign bankers
are refusing to cash American drafts
because they have no assurance that
the drafts are secure in the mails.
British War Office is
to.London, Jan. 28.—-The government'
ha trd«clded that henceforth the war
office shall be solely responsible for
the license of London from air at
tacks.
A parliamentary deputation was re
ceived by Earl Kitchener and A. J.
Balfour, first lord of the admiralty, at
the war office .today, seeking informa
tion on the protection of London from
air raids. The ministers explained to
the deputation that the difficulties in
securing adequate defense in the past
were due to a deficiency in anti-air
craft machines—a deficiency also felt
by the army and navy—but that ef
forts to remedy the shortage were
meeting with good results.
A great development In the defense
of London, they said, had been affect
ed since the last air raid and the prog
ress was not confined to the Increase
and organization of anti-air craft ar
tillery under the able superintendence
of Sir Percy Scott, but extended also
to improved arrangements for defense
by aeroplanes.
Heretofore the war office and ad
miralty had co-operated harmonious
ly in this matter but It was felt that
unity of control was desirable and
that this was only possible if the
whole work of defense were under
taken by the army. All the admiraltv
responsibilities were in the course of
being transferred to the war office and
they hoped the transference would be
completed within the next few weeks.
