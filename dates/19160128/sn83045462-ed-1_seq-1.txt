LOUS D. BRANDEIS.
President Wilson today selected
Louis D. Brandeis of Boston to
be associate justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States, j
to succeed the late Justice Lamar.
Mr. Brandeis* nomination went
to the Senate today. It was a
surprise everywhere in official
circles. Mr. Brandeis had not
even been mentioned for the va- 1
cancy. *
Mentioned for Attorney General. ^
After the election of Mr. Wilson as 5
President it was expected in some t
quarters that Mr. Brandeis would be _
made Attorney General or riven some
other position in the President's cab- C
in-t | (
The appointment of Louis L>. Bran- 1
dels came to rhe Senate as an absolute (
surnrise. Democratic members said
they were dumfounded. The opinion <
was freely expressed that the confirmation
of Mr. Brandeis would be sharply j
contested Democrats expressed their
dislike of the appointment in feeling c
terms.
One prominent democratic member of t
the Judiciary committee to which the
nomination has been referred said S
"there will be the biggest kind of a .
fight in the Senate over this nomina- *
tion." 1
Democratic senators said they never
heard of Brandeis being a democrat, j
and expressed their surprise that the
l'r? sident should have selected him after i
the frequent assertions from the White j i
House thnt only a democrat would be ; j

Was Born in Louisville. a
Louis Dembitz Brandeis was born at a
Louisville. Ky., November 13, 1856, and a
will therefore be sixty years old this j,
fall, his birth date bringing him just r
within the age limit of fifty-nine years t
old., which it was understood that
President Wilson had set upon those
whom he had been cinsidering for the
appointment. 1
Mr. Brandeis has been chiefly noted i
for his arguments before the Interstate -j
commerce commission in opposition to , ,
the requests of the railroads that they 1 *
b? allowed to increase their freight j c
rates, appearing as counsel for shin- I r
pers fighting the increased rates*, al- [ #
though he also opposed the New Haven 1
monopoly of transportation in New ^
Kngland and served as counsel for in- r
dividuals in proceedings involving the
constitutionality of women's ten-hour ,
labor laws in Oregon and Illinois and t
a nine-hour law in Ohio.
He took part in the fight in the city *
of Boston to retain the municipal sub- ^
way system, in establishing a sliding
?cale gas system In Boston, and was .
chairman of the arbitration board In 1
the New York garment workers' strike
In 1310. He also played a celebrated
fart a# counsel for Glavis in the Baltnger-Pincho?
investigation and has
been the author of numerous articles
on public franchises In Massachusetts,
life insurance, wage earners* problems,
the scientific managerment of labor
problems and the trusts.
Leader in Zionist Movement.
He has been at the forefront of the >
Zionist movement In the I'nited States,
and has recently served as counsel for
the government in the defense of Secretary
McAdoo, Controller Williams
a.nd Treasurer RiirW* in ??ii? I
against these Treasury officials by the '
Biggs National Band of Washington, j
In which the bank charged that the j
officials were trying to wreck the bank.
Mr. B'andeis was educated in the 1
public and high schools of Louisville
and is the son of Adolph and Fredericks.
'Dembitz) Brandeis. He studied
in Dresden. 1873 to 1875. and later
graduated from Harvard University.
H n married Miss Alice Goldmark of j 1
New York in IS in and was admitted to .
the bar in 1878. He is a resident of
Boston, where he has practiced his 1
profession since 1879. i
It was in 1910 that Mr. Brandeis came 1
so prominently to the front in connec- j
tlor. with the ' allroads. when he sug- 1
geatcd rhr.t by trying.to.meet increased i
axpenccs by raising rates the railroad I
k
men might reduce expenses by adopting
what he called more efficient methods
of management.
'Showed" Western Railroads.
"Show us!" cried several railroad
presidents immediately. A number of
them got together and sent a telegram
to Mr. Brandeis, in which they hinted
that if he could point out a way by
which could be saved a substantial
portion of the waste of $1,000,000 which
he had declared the roads were losing
daily through inefficient management
"several western railways would be
pleased to tender you employment, allowing
you to name your own salary."
Mr. Brandeis proceeded to "show
them" by presenting the testimony of
a number of men who had evolved and
demonstrated a scientific plan through
which could, he broken up by more efficient
methods the cycle of raising the
cost of living by higher prices and then
raising wages to meet the higher
prices, thus beginning a new cycle of
the same kind. He declined the salary
offer.
Attacked New Haven Merger.
Mr. Brandeis learned of the propose
merger of the New York, New Haven
and Hartford with the Boston and
Maine railroad. He thought there
ought to be no railroad monopoly in
New England and he hired halls and j
stirred up the people. He obtained j
legislation which prevented a merging
of the two properties and requiring1
that the two systems be operated independently.
For this fight many persons
thought Mr. Brandies was receiving
a fat fee from some source. They
were surprised to learn that he was
doing his work for nothing.
He became interested in the working
hours of women and offered to serve
permanently without fee as the general
counsel of the National Consumers'
League. In this cause he won his case
Tor the establishment of a ten-hour day
To* women in Oregon and in Illinois.
For these cases a new form of brief
was prepared under his direction, that
for the Oregon test covering 160 pages
and that for the Illinois case 610 pages.
In Oregon the decision of the court
quoted largely from his brief. He interrupted
the Pinohot-Ballinger hearng
for four days in order to go to
Springfield. 111.. to argue. without
^harge. the case in that state. In this
nstance his task was that of inducing
he supreme court of Illinois to reverse
tself. He succeeded.
DEMOCRATSPRAISE
DENSE SPEECHES
Congressional Visitors to the
White House Applaud President's
New York Talks.
RECEPTION BY PUBLIC
IS MOST ENTHUSIASTIC
loped on Western Trip Mr. Wilton
Will Answer Criticisms of Col.
Roosevelt and Others.
Democratic congressional visiors
to the White House today
tpplauded the vigor and agfresvveness
of President Wilton's
speeches in New York yeserday.
They declared that this
ittitude on the part of the Presilent
was necessary to win ^liis
ight for preparedness in lining up
Jongress and the country; necessary
to offset the charges of his
idversaries that his foreign polities
have been weak and without
he firmness that would tret re
>ults; necessary to stiffen his poitical
supporters, many of whom
lave quietly criticised his course
11 Mexico and in Europe.
Newspaper men who accompanied the
'resident to New York and who have
>een with him on numerous former
rips to that city and elsewhere are
inanimous in agreeing that his receplon
in New York yesterday was far
nore cordial and enthusiastic than on
iny other trip. This was apparent,
hey said today, not only among the
udiences addressed by him but on the
treets, where there could be no stimuation
of enthusiasm such as that at a
?anquet of many persons, with the atnosphere
and surroundings conducive
o arousing the sentimentalities.
New York Especially Interested.
In an analysis of the reasons for the
ncreased enthusiasm for the President,
t was pointed out, of course, that New
fork is more vitally interested in pre>aredness
than any other city in the
ountry. as. in case of war, it would
irobablv be the first under attack from
t foreign foe, with its millions as a
ure to the enemy, and the President
vent to New York to talk on preparedless.
It was declared, though, that the
pepper" shown by the President probibly
had something to do with the enhusiasm
awakened at all places visitrd
by him. It stirred his audiences,
vhich received an impression of him
lifferent from former views.
it is understood to be likely that the
President's speeches on his western
:rip, which begins tonight, his first
ipeech being in Pittsburgh early tomorrow
afternoon, will be fully as aggressive
as those in New York yesterlay.
His political friends hope so, any
vav. they said today. They want to
tee him wake up the people and arouse
hem to the dangers of unprcparedness.
rhey want to see him follow this
ourse. too, as an antidote to the severe
criticisms of Col. Roovevelt and
others that he is "too proud to fight." j
That expression of his, explained aftsrward
as having no bearing upon his j
oreign policies, nan Deen rung from
one end of the country to the other by
'2pi. Roosevelt and republican opponents.
Politicians are going to watch carefully
the outcome of the trip in the
west, where the people are not as directly
interested in preparedness as in
\"ew York, but where aggressiveness
tas brought political reward to distinguished
statesmen with whom the
country has familiar acquaintance.

AMERICA MAY BAR
UNERSWITN GUNS
Belligerents Asked to Square
U-Boat Warfare With In(amm
aIIamaI I Alii
iciMctuunai Law>
POWERS ARE NOTIFIED
BY STATE DEPARTMENT
U. S. Declares That Merchant Ships
Entering Its Ports Must Have
\
XVu*_jmament Whatever.
The United States, in asking all
the European belligerents to
make a general agreement to
square their submarine warfare
with the principles of humanity
and international law. has taken
the position that under changed
conditions of naval warfare, merchant
ships should carry no armament
whatever.
All the powers have been notified
that unless they subscribe to
such principles armed merchantmen
will be denied entry to
American ports except under the
conditions which apply to warships.
Summary of the Note.
Such a proposal now In the hands of
the belligerent governments has been
transmitted in a note which, while not
in actual language, is substantially as
follows:
It is assumed that all of the governments
addressed are equally desirous
of protecting their own subjects and
citizens who are non-combatants from
the hazards of submarine warfare.
Realizing the appalling loss of life of
non-combatants which results from the
destruction of a merchant vessel without
removing passengers and crews to
places of safety, which is held to be
violative of the principles of humanity
and of international law, which should
govern maritime warfare, the United
States, at the same time, does not feel
that a belligerent should be deprived
of the right to use submarines in view
of the usefulness which they have developed
since the outbreak of the present
war.
Proposals of United States.
That a formula may be found completely
within the rules of international
law and of humanity which will require
in its adoption only a trifling
change in the practices which have obtained
in the past and before the war,
which formula would be Just and fair
to all belligerents, it is proposed that:
First?A non-combatant has the right
to traverse the high seas in a merchant
ship entitled to fly a belligerent flag,
and rely upon the rules of international
law, and the principles of humanity
if the vessel is approached by a
belligerent war vessel.
Second?A merchant vessel of any
nationality should not be subject to
attack until the belligerent warship
has warned her to stopfe
Should Halt When Ordered.
Third?Any belligerent-owned merchant
vessel should promptly obey any
order from a belligerent warship to
stop.
Fourth?No such merchant vessel
should be flred upon unless she tries to
flee or to resist by force, and even in
such case any attack upon her by the
warship must stop as soon as the flight
or resistance ceases.
Fifth?Only in case it should be impossible
for military reasons for the
warship to supply a prize crew or to
convoy the merchant ship into port
will she be justified in sinking such
merchantman, and in that case passengers
and crew must be removed to
a place of safety.
Difficulties Are Appreciated.
Thf. Sit:?tr* rtPnartmoil it. /..II..
^ ? ? ajJJ" c- J
ciative of the obstacles which the
adoption of these rules would place in
the way of the operations of the submarines
because of their structural
weakness. Before the present war
maritime warfare on the high seas al-ij
ways has been conducted by battleships
or cruisers carrying heavy guns.
It is true that merchantmen were i
permitted to carry defensive armament,
but these were light compared with the
warships and did not change their nature
as merchant vessels. This was
based on the superior defensive
strength of the warships and the limitation
upon their armaments was for
the purpose of limiting their power of
resistance to contact with pirates and
privateers. .
The introduction of the submarine !
into naval warfart has changed all of I
this. This craft is almost without
powers of defense beyond the ability
to submerge to tscape an enemy.
Light Gun Effective.
A gun even of light caliber on a merchant
ship successfully could defend
her against a submarine. There are
now no more piratee, and the practice
of privateering has been abandoned by
civilized nations by general agreement.
Therefore, there can now be no reason
for the maintenance of even small
caliber guns on merchant ships unless
it is designed to make them superior to
submarines, and thereby deprive that
class of warships of their undoubted
right with safety to warn and search
such merchantmen. In reality, therefore,
any such armament of a merchant
vessel now might be regarded as offensive.
armament.
If submarines should be required to
stop and search merchant vessels before
attacking them and to remove
the passengers and crews to places of
safety, it Is not fair that the submarines
should be compelled to expose
themselves to destruction at the hands
of merchantment.
General Agreement Necessary.
Therefore, by a general agreement
among the belligerents submarines
should be required to adhere strictly
to the present provision of international
law to stop and search merchant
ships; to ascertain their belligerent
character and remove the passengers

Praise of the Work of Secretary

CALLS HIM RED-BLOODED,

A
South Carolinian Also Attacks Statement
Attributed to Former Secretary
Meyer.
B
"The Truth About the Navy" was the
subject of an address by Senator Tillman
in the Senate today. The chairman
of the naval affairs committee, in
characteristic vein, singled out and attacked
George von L. Meyer, former
Secretary of the Navy. He predicted
that Secretary Daniels will go down in ^
history as "one of the greatest secretaries
the navy has ever known."
Senator Tillman declared untrue the
charges made by former Secretary
Meyer before the National Security Congress
to the effect that the navy is
"brainless." There still remains Admiral
George Dewey. Senator Tillman
declared, and then he lauded the heads
of the various bureaus of the Navy
Department today. vj
"The head of the navy himself is not
a pampered and petted darling of inherited
wealth," said Senator Tillman,
"but a red-blooded, upstanding, for- tC
ward-looking American, who is a gradate
in the hard school of experience le
and a practical man with wholesome
ideas. I predict that Josephus Daniels
will go down in history as one of the
greatest secretaries the navy has ever *1"
had." n<
Senator Tillman's Address. Gl
Senator Tillman continued:
"Imagine my astonishment when I
read in the New York Sun of January in
22, the following:
" 'The fundamental defect of the Navy si
Department is that it has no brain, | ,
no competent military organization j A
charged with the preparation of the j
fleets for war and with their con- SC
duct in war, and in consequence the | .1
I Navy i% being built and administered J t'1
on a police basis, and is not being ef-1 :
ficiently prepared for war service.' Ju
"Can any of you guess who made ...
this woeful utterance, and where?
George von L. Meyer, former Secretary q?
of the navy. tThe speech was made at '
the New Willard Hotel, in this city tr
recently before the National Security
I^eague, where many of those patriots si'
who are zealously endeavoring to turn
] the demoirats out of office and get #
1 back in themselves had assembled for
conference.
I "I flatter myself?whether It is true ?_
or not?that a large majority of my
fellow-countrymen have absolute reli- vc
anee upon my integrity. They believe th
, I will tell the truth, if I know it. J, rn
therefore, feel it to be my duty to make .
the speech I am now making in order
to let the world know what 1 believe aP
to be the exact conditions and that I
feel warranted in saying what 1 do in pa
regard to the navy and the Navy Department.

Discusses Increase of Navy. ca
"It behooves us all to be on the alert
( in regard to increasing our navy and ^
its adjuncts along all reasonable lines.
The United States ought to have a navy sa
. second only to Greot Britain. But we at
need not lose our heads and run wild to
in pursuing that object, and above all
no one should be unjust and untruth- i
ful in criticisms of existing conditions
set
"Looking further, I found this para- ^
graph in Mr. Meyer's speech:
"'Nothing demonstrates unprepared- j
! on
ness in the navy inore than shortage , reg
of personnel.. To go on a war basis we gui
are short about 2,000 officers, after emtru
ploying all that are on the retired list wh

"Mr. Meyer forgets, if he ever knew, po.
that at the time he left the Navy De- att
partment the service was nearly 6,000
short of the authorized enlisted complement;
that 46 per cent of the men
discharged in good standing were then
leaving the navy, while 8& per cent are 7
now re-enlisting; that during his in- s0l
cumbency there were 10,360 desertions. .
