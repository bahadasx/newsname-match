' The widespread prevalence of

putients must betaken care of by
members of the f am Ily. The fol
lowing suggestions may ie help

The siok roam should contain
little furniture. All surplus rugs,
draperies and furnishings should
be jremoved. This gives more
spaee and makes ; disinfection
easier after thai Biokness is over.'
All oases of siokness, including
pnettmonla and catarrhal infec
tion, do beat in a cool, well-ven
tilated room. Ventilation with
out draft should be provided for
by meant of window. boards cr
similar devices to throw the air
up toward the oeiling. - "
.The patient should be keep
eaQ and quiet. A single thin
garment, such as a nightgown or
ightsbirt, is all that is needed.
he bundling up of siok persons
with; plasters, rags and woolens
Is bad from every standpoint. :
Patients should not be annoy
ed by having to aek for every
thing. At the same time, they
hoald not be asked every, few
minutes whether they wish some
thing, The nurse, guided by the
physician, should know what the
patient needs and supply it at the
proper time.
Visiting is, as a rule, to be ta
booed ; When conversation ,: is
necessary, it should be in a mod
erate tone of voice without excite
ment. Whispering Is generally
worse than loud talking, Food,
prepared well and daintily,
should be brought to the patient
at the necessary time. The pa
tient should not be asked what he
wishes to eat.
The siok person should not be
annoyed by hard-luok stories,
either the personal experience of
the nurat or of the neighbors,
The nurse should invariably
obey the Instructions of the phy-
sioian. "
If the disease is one In whioh
the sputum carries the contagion,
the sputum should be promptly
disinfected by burning, if pos
sible. - Handkerohiefs should
either be burned atonoe or drop
ped into boiling water. All di
seases are more contagious by
direot oontaot than otherwise.
he nurse should always remem
ber the danger of spreading the
nf eotion to other : persons and
endeavor to prevent it.

Spring is the dangerous season
for bees, says Leonard Haseman,
professor of entomology and en
tomologist to the agricultural
experiment station at Columbia.
Following unfavorable seasons,
starvation is to be watched. .'
Drone oorab may oost . the
owner of a few hives several
dollars in deoreased production
of honey and in : waste of sur-
pluehoney to feed the drones.
Muoh time and energy may be
wasted by. the ; bees - making
comb that could be used profit
ably In making honey.
Losses from starvation may
be prevented by feeding the ool-
ony extracted honey . or sugar
syrup with a division board feed
er. Colonies of bees whioh do
not have sufficient winter stores
in the brood chamber should be
fed in the fall before oold weath
er sets in, . In the spring, when
the oolony begins to rear its
brood of young bees, it needs as
food both honey and pollen or a
substitute for pollen. Rye flour
In a box on some clean, bright
hay in a sunny place will supply
bees with a substitute for pollen
until nature furnishes flowers for
them to work on. This will help
prevent spring dwindling.
In a bulletin ' on "Farm Bee-
Keeping" reoently issued by Pro
fessor Haseman and E. E, Tyler,
an experienced bee-keeper, the
authors show that the production
of wax is an expensive and waste
ful operation; The wax is secre
ted by the worker bees, and they
will eat about fifteen or twenty
pounds of honey to secrete one
pound of wax and work it Into
comb. Artificial comb founda
tion should always be put in
frames and sections as starters,
and for the greatest honey yield
one should use an extractor for
throwing the honey out of the
combs and then return the unin
jured oombs to the hive for re
filling. Anyone using oomb
foundation and an extractor more
than doubles the ability of his
bee Colony. .;!
