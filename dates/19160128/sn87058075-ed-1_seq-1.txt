Business Men Have a Chance to Preach
The following questions has been sent
to a large number of the business and
professional men of Cresco by the pas
tor of the Methodist church and though
the replies will be considered strictly
confidential, based upon them the pastor
will preach several sermons, beginning
Sunday night.
1. Why are not more men members
of the church in the city?
2. Are the churches of your ac
quaintance doing the work you believe
they ought to do? If not, describe the
one that would?
3. What do you consider the most
helpful phase of church work? What
do you understand by being "convert
ed?"
4. Do you believe the churches ought
to be a school of instruction as to local
moral problems?
5. Do the present activites of the
church appeal to you as a man's job?
Could the churches do more than it
does to prevent poverty, intemperance
and juvenile delinquency?
6. If you were a preacher what
would be the first thing you would do?
As an introduction, and while the
rest are getting their replies in, the
pastor will speak Sunday night on the
business and the economic value of
the church." We will appreciate the
balance of the replies this week.
The Sunday morning services as us
ual at 10:30 Sunday pchool and Ep
worth League at usual hours. The
pastor is glad to be back on the work.
The meetings at Decorah resulted in a
number of conversions and the church
enthused. Those good people were
very hearty in their words of apprecia
tion and enjoyment for services ren
dered.

A voice we loved is stilled,
A place is vacant in our home,
Which never be filled.
And yet as Christians we do not
mourn as those who have no hope. He
who said: "I am the resurection and
the life" has given us aright to hope
for a like inheritance as that to which
this hard worked faithful wife and
mother has just passed.
The funeral was conducted by Rev.
H. N. Norman, the services at the
house being in Norwegian, and those
at the First Lutheran church in English.
The attendance was quite large,

sympathy to the bereaved and their
respect to the deceased. The Lord
comfort the sorrowing. *,*
