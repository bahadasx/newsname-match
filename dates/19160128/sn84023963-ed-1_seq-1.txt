A Suggestive Argument
in Favor of
rilPABEDMESS
ENGLAND'S SACRED BEAST.
The present session of congress will
be the most important in its scope
since the civil war.
Millions will be appropriated for de
fense. The traditional policies of the
government .will probably be revolutionized.
The Army and Navy
will have more money at their
disposal during" the next fev
years than ever before during
time of peace..
Our diplomatic relations with
some of the countries at war
may be suspended at any time.
War may possibly follow such
action on our part.
Peace May Be Declared
during the new year between
the countries now at war, and it
is assumed that the United
States will become the chief ar
bitrator, if it is able to re
main neutral until such time.
Mexico
is in a reconstructive period and
continues to make history of the
most pitiful type.
The National Conven
tions Will Be Held
in June
. xms is presidential year. Tes- f
ident Wilson will probably be-1
indorsed again by the Demo- )
crats and be renominated. Who- :
the Republican candidate will be
is yet a matter of speculation.
These are only a few of the big
things the leading newspapers
of the country will tell about.
In the meantime all the news of
interest to the home and to
women and children is not to be
neglected.
Everybody Should Be
Prepared
to keep posted on these all-important
events and no American
citizen should remain in igno- '
ranee of what is going on.
No person can expect to keep
posted on the affairs of the big
wide world unless he reads a
metropolitan newspaper. The
local paper, which gives him the
items from his immediate neigh
borhood, covers its field, which
is from force of circumstances,
confined to a small radius.
The Indianapolis News
has every existing facility for
gathering news. It is a client
of the two great press associa
tions, THE ASSOCIATED
PRESS and THE UNITED
PRESS, which cover eveiy part
of the globe.
Its Washington bureau is
manned by an .experienced staff
of writers, and in the rtate of
Indiana there are over 800 cor
respondents, covering practical
ly every hamlet, town and city.

"Down in the country the other

; writes the London correspondent of
! Town and Country. '"One of their

demands that the hunt shall na'
the damages. The hunt generally
pays, though in innumerable cases
tno secretary is well aware that he
is being swindled.
But this particular farmer said
he had hunted for many years him
self and had never made a claim for
lost hens. A year or two ago, how
ever, a tox had paid a nocturnal
visit to his fowl yard and had played
havoc with the feathered denizens.
A night or two after it happened
again. A third time the fox came
round and made a most deplorable
mess of a lot of fine Wvandottea
and some expensive Buff Orping
tons.
ihen the farmer wrote to the
hunt secretary aaJ asked for dam
mi . m - -
;ages. J. he repiy was that the claim
would .be attended to shortly, and
at Christmas the settlement came
j in the form of a: ham. Thereupon
!tne tanner declared war on all foxes
and killed them ruthlessly. And
fcms was the p int which puzzled the
fanners on Saturday night.
"'Jim. Crawford shot a fox last
year said one of .the men, 'and no
good lias come to him since. It
ain't lucky and it ain't sportsman
like. Let 'em kill vour hens. That's
what they are there for, and i one
