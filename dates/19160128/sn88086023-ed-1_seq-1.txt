KNTKHTAI.VMKXTS.
Under instructions rrom Mayor J.
A. HeBt, the big barn on Chestnut
street which has lately been used as
a dance hall was yesterday afternoon
condemned for such use by the po
lice and fire chief. Conditions were
found to lie such there that the offi
cers had plenty of authority without
special dance-regulating ordinance.'
The ofrtcers found that the danc-1
ing had been done in the upper story j
r the barn, to reach which the danc
ers had to ascend a narrow ladder in
one end f the barn. In the upper
tor) two stoves had been set up and
light was furnished by a hanging
lamp. The officers declare that both j
stoves and lamp constituted a source
of Imminent danger from fire nnd !
lhat. had a fire started, the dancers
would have been trapped.
Moreover, there have been com.,
plaints .if immoral dancing and dis-1
orderly conduct Rt the dances. Thej
police state that neighbors have ad-:
vised them lhat the dances have last
ed well Into the morning hours and j
that, after midnight, the scene be
come anything but decent The last:
dance held there was last Friday
night.
The owner of the barn has been!
rentina it for five dollars a night butj
the officers are not uulte sure ns tot
who has been managing the dances.
