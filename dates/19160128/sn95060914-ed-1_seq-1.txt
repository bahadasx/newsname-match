GOVERNMENT AID IS NEEDED
Lieut Stecker Writes Board of
Supervisors to Notify Hon
Carl Hayden
The new bridge across the Gila
river in the Indian reservation
which was built by the govern
ment will have to have three per
haps four new spans added to
connect with the approach on the
south side of the river
During the recent storm when
the Gila river overflowed its banks
it washed away the road leading
to the approach on the south side
creating a new channel and making
it necessary to build several new
spans to connect with the new
river bank
Benj Blake clerk of the board
of supervisors received the follow
ing letter from Lieutenant Ernest
Stecker superintendent of the San
Carlos Indian agency
To the Boards of Supervisors of
of Gila and Graham Coun
ties Arizona
Gentlemen 1 am very sorry
to be compelled to notify you that
the Gila river flood waters have
about cut off tht the bridge on the
Gila river near Natches and from
the present late oi cutting it will
in all probability require three
more spans of bridging to connect
the bridge with the new river
banks Mr Perry McMurren with
a large detachment of Indians
fought the water all night but their
efforts were of no avail
I suggest that you notify Rrpre
Representative Carl Hayden ac
cordingly ih
take such action as may be neces
sary to provide new bridge work
made necessary on account of the
flood damage
Very respectfully
Ernest Stecker
Superintendent
The Board of Supervisors will
send a letter today to Representa
tive Hayden quoting Lieutenant
Steckers letter and asking him to
secure government aid in building
the necessary new spans to con
nect the bridge with its new river
bank
This bridge is absolutely neces
sary foA the maintainance of the
highway between Gila and Gra
ham counties

The following communication received milmWSi9nt A meeting of the Common Coun a i t PI
ceived by The Guardian from Henry v cil was held Monday night at Coun panies Accept I erms
M Woods of Fort Thomas will un
doubtedly interest the farmers of
the Gila valley as it treats of a sub
ject that has been forcibly brought
to their attention by thegreatstorm
and floods ofrthe past week and the
resultant depredations on the lands
by the Gila river
It would Beem that the farmers of
the valley could accomplish a great
deal by united action in the way of
securing the needed help from
Washington for straightening the
Gila river and creating a wider
channel and unless something is
done pretty soon in the matter to
save the lands bordering on the
river the latter will eventually wipe
out these lands entirely as the i iver
is encroaching further and further
each jear
Mr Woods states his proposition
as follows
Do you know how much acreage
is contained in the Gila river chan
nel in Graham county
This question was asked your cor
respondent
The writer came to this valley
twelve years ago Among the first
things he heard from the old timers
was this In our time the Gila
was but a stones throw across
Then he began to take data of the
increase of waste lancf
It would appear that when the US
Survey of 1876 was made the esti
mated acreage of the entire chan
nel in Graham county was less than
600 acres Today a conservative
figure in ruond numbers would be
10000 acres
Weknow pretty well the reasons
for this increased waste
1 Denuding the uplands of tim
ber
2 Heavy grazing
3 Crooked river channel
The government expects io pro
tect and increase the timber with
Its Forestry Service
The heavy grazing will Jikejyjcpn
- - w
tinueV
The tortuous river channel is for
us to remedy We cannot do it
alone We need the assistance of
our government We can get this
help if we go after it in the right
way
Our suggestion is to pro rate a
small tax upon each ditch and send a
presentable representative to Wash
ington
He must be armed cap-a-pie
with authoritative data showing the
vulue of the eroded lands the rapid
increase of this erosion and the re
medy
He must be able to show that at
least 9000 acres of fertile sill loam
has been swept down entirejy out of
our district to the lower valleys
The value of this land at fifty
dollars an acre m nearly a half
million dollars 45000000
An appropriation of half the
amount of this loss would put the
channel in shape to carry all the
water likely to flow here and re
claim 5000 acres worth at least
25000000
Five or six hundred dollars would
initiate this proposition

Expert Figures Tractor Costs
The most important thing about
a tractor to a farmer is what it will
do to put money into his pocket
He invests his money with the idea
that it will pay dividends A Sieve
Grip investment will do more than
that it will refund the principal
See here said a representative
of the company well figure a man
has 100 acres 60 in grain land and
40 in orchard It costs about a
dollar a day to operate the 4 to 5
Sieve Grip This machine pulls two
12 inch bbttoms 7 inches deep in
ordinary soils at a trifle better than
2 nmes per hour That means 5
acres of ground turned over a day

could own the park under the fol
lowing conditions
By a payment of 1000 when the
sale was accomplished the balance
to be paid at the rrte of 500 a year
at 6 per cent interest In the event
that he town purchased the park
and paid 1000 as the first pay
ment he would donate the sum of
250 to the public library fund
The proposition was discussed by
the members present There was
no doubt in the minds of the coun
cilmen but that the people of the
town should have a public park and
that Wickersham Park was situated
ideally for such a purpose but the
question arose as to how it could be
purchased by the town
It was contended that the Com
mon Council have no authority in
law to make the purchase of this
park but that it might be accom
plished through a vote of the peo
ple at the coming town election
which will be held next May
Another way to secure the pur
chase of the park for the people
would be by taxation A levy of
two mills would give the amount
needed for the first payment and a
levy of one mill would raise enough
to pay off the second note of 500
and interest and the succeeding
notes could be paid on a levy of less
than one mill This method of taxa
tion could be accomplished if the
people would decide by a majorit
vote ac tne next town election in
faUfUherftownpjurjcha8ingWick
ersham Park
Another method would be bj
taking advantage of the law passed
by the last legislature which pro
vides that the Common Council can
levy an assessment for the purpbse
pose of raising funds for the cham
ber of commence so that that body
could carry out successfully any
plans for municipal improvements
needed by the town In this way
the money could be raised to pur
chase the park and the title passed
from the chamber of commerce to
to the town
No action was taken by the Com
mon Council in the matter other
than it was deemed advisable to
have the people vote upon the prop
osition at the town election in May
and the meeting adjourned
