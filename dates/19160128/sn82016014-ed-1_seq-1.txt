PARSONS TO STAY
Chief of Police Has Reconsid
ered His Plan to Resign.
Mayor and Friends Prevail on
Him to Keep Place.
H. O Parsons, chief of police, has i
been prevailed upon by friends to con- '
tinue on the job, even without an In- j
crea.se in salary, ana ne win not re
sign. A week ago, after Mayor J. E.
House had exhausted every resource
in an attempt to increase Parsons's
salary without violating the law. Par
sons wrote the mayor a letter in which
he asked for a vacation in which to
look for another job. The mayor took
the matter up again and went over the
Ptate law and city ordinances, in an
effort to find some way out. When
everything else failed the mayor tried
to talk Parsons out of the notion of
resigning. Friends came to his res
cue and among them they persuaded
Parsons to reconsider.
One thing Parsons is interested in
as much as an increase for himself
is an increase for the patrolmen and
it is not improbable that some assur
ances were given him that the patrol
men might receive an increase before
the year is out.

' (Written for Topeka State Journal.)
The Hague, Jan. 2 8. Henry Ford's
peace mission failed for lack of
"faith.' According to his own state
ment faith was Ford's sole stock when
; he started. He had not enough and
! thoe who accompanied him, with a
i few exceptions, appear to have had but
f little.
I Those of the party who really wish
ed the expedition well were so bitter
, ly hated that an effort was made to
! maroon a number of them at the first
! European port touched. Ford's plan,
as nearly as it is possible to put so
: intangible a thing on paper, was to
i give the warring nations mental sci
. ence treatment. Ford himself at the
outset had unbounded faith in hie
ability. Despite trie statement at
tributed to him that he intended to
j "get the boys out of the trenches by
i Christmas," he did not count on im
rmd'attly ending the war.
What Ford did believe wa? that he
ould "make a dent' by gathering
bout him a whole ship's company,
'nitinsr the mt-mbers' minds on one
"big thought of peace" and continually
idding to the volume1 and intensity of
'his thought as he and his crusaders
raveled from neutral country to neu
tral country, on the edge of the zone
, of war, or even in the zone its If.
' Quarreled Constantly.
Whether this pain would have suc
ceeded under favorable circumstances
can't be stated, because the peace dele
gates failed to concentrat 1 on thoughts
of peace. The Owar IIs voyage from
New York to Christlania was horrible,
; not so much because of the incessant
; quarreling as- on account of the atmos-
phere of suspicion and malice after the

Mr. Brandeis' nomination went to

Mr. Brandeis is a lawyer who ha.3

Kansas Day Guest of Honor in
the City Today.
Ohio Senator Predicts Reunion
of Parties Soon.
NATIONAL DEFENSE PROBLEM
It Is a Campaign Issue That
Cannot Be Avoided.
Will ?fot Discuss His Candidacy
for President.
Reunion of the Republicans and
Progressives for the coming national
contest is predicted by Senator Theo
dore E. Burton of Ohio, guest of hon
or of Kansas Republicans. Senator
Burton arrived in Topeka this after
noon. Theodore Burton.
At the National hotel Senator Bur
ton declared that relations of the two
parties were shaping themselves in
way that pointed to a Republican vie
tory in November. The tariff, nation
al defense, foreign relations and the
Mexican situation are the chief issues
of the campaign as seen by Burton.
"As a patriotic American citizen. I
have hoped that national defense
would not be an issue in the cam
paign, yet it seems that the issue can
not be avoided," said Senator Burton.
"Protection will be one of the big
questions before the people in the
coming campaign, while foreign poli
cies and the Mexican question must
also be disposed of.
Same Over Country.
"Indications from every section of
the country indicate that the Progres
sives and Republicans will be together
in the national fight. I believe that is
the general tendency everwhere just
as I find it here in Kansas."
Senator Burton declined to make a
statement as to the underlying policies
and motives of President Wilson's
western trip to discuss preparedness.
"Every president has done it," he
said. "As1 to underlying reasons, I can
not say." Nor would the Ohioan ven
ture a guess.
In Kansas and at this time, Senator
Burton will not discuss the prospects
of his own candidacy for the presiden
tial nomination. Neither is he dis
posed to talk of the action of the na
tional convention or the candidacies of
his opponents.
This is Senator Burton's first visit
to Kansas since 1912. At that time he
was selected by the Republican na
tional convention to follow President
Wilson on his western speaking tour.
Senator Burton spoke in Topeka in
October, 1912, a week following the
Wilson address.
