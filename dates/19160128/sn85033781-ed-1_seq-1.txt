motor. Eight dealers will have eights

YOUNG m PAW
LAWYER HONORED
SWEETEST GIRL
IN DIXIE A HIT
Play Staged by Local I.O.O.
F. Under Direction of AN
lan O. White Played to
Crowded Houses Monday
and Tuesday Nights.
Monda) evening tbe opera bouse was
crowded to its capacity by an apprecia
tive audience to witness the home talent
production under tbe management of
AHen O. White.
As tbe curtain slowly rolled into posi
tion it presented to view tbe stage set
ting of a typical southern borne of tbe .
old style.
Miss Christine Carr, as The Sweetest
Girl in Dixie, seemed to be the very girl
for this roll. She was very much at
borne on tbe stage and played her part
in a manner that would make much
older and experienced actresses look
well to their laurels Even Mary Pick
ford might have to look twice in her own
mirror to make sure of herself.
Ray Curtiss, the hero and lover of tbe
plot, was also fine and plaed bis part
with all the ardor that could be desired.
He proved quite a star.
Tbe colored parts of Auut Caroline and
Uncle George were bandied in a most
capable and artistic manner by Mrs.
Charles Filley and Percy Wheeler. They
caused great bursts of laughter to sweep
over the entire audience most of the
time and were both stars at their parts.
DAigbt Barker has su'ely missed hia
calling and we would not be surprised
to hear that be bad given up meat cut
ting and taken to cutting up antics on
tbe stae. His makeup was all that
could be desired and he ma le a decided
bit in the manner in Ahicb be handled
his part.
J. H RtcHard, as the confederate colo
nel and the father of the dweetest Girl
in Dixie, acted his part well and seemed
to be tbe very man for that character.
Fern Hess, as the old maid, Matilda
Martin, was one of the greatest surprises
of tbe evening So well did she look
and play her part that everything in
sight began to look oid and stiff as soon
as she appeared on tbe ecne. She sure
was Kood and it would bve taken s me
one way up lu tbe profesaion to beat her.
Mrs. Winnie Taylor as a number one
beggar was a good character and bard to
beat.
It was one good show and Mr VVnite
proved himself of more thao ordinary
ability to drill into bis characters such
perfect interpretation of their various
characters as to make Monday evenn g's
entertainment tbe complete success that
it was in just one short week, and also
the fact that so many of the cast were
those who appeared on the stage for tbe
first time in their lives.
The I. O O F. made a nice little sum
and all who bad anything to do with, the
success of the play ar to be congratu
