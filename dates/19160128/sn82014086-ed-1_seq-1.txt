Like "A Ship at Sea, With Typh

loon
"-Jishington, Jan. 27, The position
of the United States in a war-torn
world was described to the house mili
tary committee today by Major General
Leonard Wood as like that of "a ship
at sea, with typhoon signals coming
from many directions."
"We are living in an era of war,"
he said, "and gradually are accumu
lating most of the troubles of the
world. '
- General "Wood, who appeared at the
committee's hearings on the army In
crease bills, repeated in the main the
testimony he previously had given be
fore the senate military committee. He
said it would take an army of a mil
lion and a half to hold a line from
Boston south. Should conditions at the
close of the war in Europe invite at
tack, he declared, any of the ' more
powerful of the belligerents could land
500.00 men on 'American soil in less
than thirty days. - -
A regular army of 220,000 men fully
trained and always under arms, with
at least 2,000,000 reserves behind them,
should be provided, he urged, to meet
this situation. " The United States
navy he classed as fourth in fighting
efficiency and declared it could not
maintain control of the sea or de
fend the coasts.
While General Wood and Colonel
Edwin F. Glenn, chief of staff of the
department of the east, were testify
ing before the house and senate mil
itary comm'ttees respectively, . Rear
Admiral R. S. Griffin, chief engineer of
the navy, told the house naval com
mittee, considering navy increases, of
the mechanical ills to which subma
rines are heir and of the problem of
finding suitable engines for battleships
and destroyers.
Admiral Griffin said he believed no
foreign power was outstripping the
United States in naval design and that
type for American craft was as effi
cient as any afloat. To show the
condition of American submarines he
read a report statin e that each of them
had done from 1,000 to 7,000 miles of
surface cruising and several hundred
miles submerged last year. Their en
gines were available for duty approx
imately 300 days out of the year, he
added.

Will be on the Stand Two Days More.
irovidence, R. I, Jan. 27. The first
serious break in the marital relations
of the late Dr. C. FVanklin Mohr and
his wife, Elizabeth F. Mohr. who is
charged with having hired two negroes
to kill him, occurred at the time she
told her husband of her friendship for
a man named Samuel A- McDougaH.
who is now a minister In Plctou, Nova
Scotia. -
Broke Down and Sobbed.
This statement was elicited from
Mrs. Mohr during a severe cross ex
amination this afternoon by Araey
General Rice. Step by step the prose
cuting attorney brought out the de
tails of Mrs. Motif's life. Occasionally
during the examination " she seemed
confused as to dates and facts given
in her direct testimony and several
times broke down and sobbed.
Tried to Hsvs Minister Unfrocked.
It was in 1912, she, said, that she first
told Dr. Mohr about McDougaU. The
doctor, she admitted, was incensed and
went to Nova Scotia to try to have the
minister unfrocked. The attorney gen
eral then reminded her that in her di
rect testimony she said that her hus
band had gone "to the provinces to
sec a friend."
"The doctor Was under the influence
of drugs," said Mrs. Mohr. "He asked
me if I preferred McDougall to him.
and I told him that the wav he was
acting I thought McDougaU would have
oeen Better, as; be did not touch
liquor." : ' - - -.

doctor that she had left jProvldence to
go to Boston because : of - notoriety
causea oy ner - friendship with Mc
Dougall. She could not keen eomrmnv
with. McDougall, she said, because the
amerence in their religious beliefs
made it Impossible for her to become
a minister's wife.
- It was at about the time she told
the doctor about McDougall, the attor
ney general brought out. that Mrs.
Mohr and her husband had a falling
out and that he began to correspond
with Miss Emily Burger, who later be
came his secretary and who was seri
ously, wounded at the time the doctor
was shot down in their stalled auto
mobile. Came from Ireland to Norwich.
Recounting her early life, Mrs. Mohr
said she was born at Belfast, Ireland,
and was brought to this country by
her people, who settled In Norwich,
Conn. Later they went to Taunton.
The witness appeared a little confused
when asked when she was born. She
replied that she was born Feb. 9, 1880,
and was 34 years old, but later cor
rected this testimony by saying the
date was 1882. She said she was the
youngest of ten children. Her father
died when she was 12 years old and
her mother in 1907. Through choice
rether than necessity she began work
at the age of 17, learning the millinery
trade in a Taunton shop, where she
remained for three or four months.
Tells Where She Worked. -
Mrs. Mohr said that she worked also
for three months in a variety store in
Taunton and that there was no special
reason why she left the millinery store
and the variety store after only three
months' service. Later she was em
ployed about a year In O'Gorman's
store at Providence and thereafter was
a buyer of art goods for Pitts-Klmball
in 'Boston. She stayed at the latter
place several months and left because
she had not been feeling well. She
began to receive attention from Dr.
Mohr in March, 1902, - against the
wishes or her family.
Wished to Board in a Convent, '
Witness said that the doctor, who
was then living in Providence, wished
her to marry him. but her folks would
not . give their consent. She went to
New York and obtained a position in
"the New York Millinery store" on
West Twenty-second street. She was
there not quite three months. She
wished to board at a convent on West
Seventeenth street, but was unable to
get accommodations there and found
rooms in the same street. ;
. Confused About Certain Dates.
Mrs. Mohr here explained that she
had been confused about certain dates
rrentloned and that she went to New
York in March. 1903. The doctor vis
Ited her there only once and that when
he came to marry her. - She had met
him through Anna Spencer, a buyer at
O Gorman s.
Went to Keith's. '
"Didn't you go out evenings with
Anna Spencer and have a good time?"
the attorney general asked.
"I went to Keith's."
She admitted she lived in the same
house with Anna Spencer in this city.
Common Law Marriage.
"Did you contract a common law
marriage or ritual marriage in New
York?"
"I left It to my husband.'
Ths witness said she was "past 24
when shs was married.
"Do you remember your wedding
aayr . .' ,
"I certainly do." ....

Mrs. Mohr said shs told the doctor
that me wanted to be married by a

to have him perform the ceremony.
She said Rev. Ralph Munroe of Brook
lyn married them.
"There were two ladies present" she
said. "One was 70 years old and the
other was 45. They were the witness

"And this is all the care you took
to safeguard your honor?"
Took the Doctor's' Word.
"Why, I didn't know better. Mr. Rice.
I took the doctor's word for every
thing." i
Mr. Rice repeated the question and
Mrs. Mohr answered, "Yes."
Mrs. Mohr said she did not live
alone when she first came to Provi
dence. "I was living with a woman who
knew me when I was three years old
In Norwich. Conn." she declared.
"Do you mean that you didn't :o
about with Dr. Mohr in Providence?"
Counsel for the defense objected.
"What's the materiality of that ques
tion?" asked the court.
"I am attempting to show that she
was living with Dr. Mohr a year and
a half before the alleged marriage
replied Mr. Rice. J
Never Lived with Dr, Mohr Prior to
.'. v Marriage. ' .-'
Td like to answer the question,"
spoke up Mrs. Mohr. "I never lived
with Dr. Mohr until he became my
husband."
"Didn't Dr. -Mohr always deny that
he was married to you?"
"Not that I know of, excepting- the
time he was. under the influence of
drugs and told me I couldn't prove
there was a marriage as the minister
was dead." , f
Discrepancy in Dats of Mother's Death
This was In 1909. Mrs. Mohr said
she then went home and told her
mother what the doctor had said and
that it broke her mother's heart.
"And the news caused your mother's
death T asked Mr. Rice.
"Yes, sir."
"And yet your mother died in 1907.
