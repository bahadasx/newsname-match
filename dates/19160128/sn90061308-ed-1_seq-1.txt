FEAR THIRTY-SIX PERSONS
DIE IN M'ALESTER FLOOD
McAlester, Qk., Jan. 26. This city
was in darkness tonight, scores of res
idences" and business houses were
flooded by a torrential rain late today,
and in the confusion of rescuing more
than 100 families from their water
periled homes it was feared at least
thirty-six persons had been drowned.
Downtown streets became swift riv
ers after five hours of rain which had
riot ceased entirely tonight. Drainage
systems were incapable of caring for
the great precipitation with the result
that the water began to pour into
dwellings and store rooms, forcing
tenants to move to upper stories.
Sand Creek, running through the
heart of the city, was forced out of its
banks, covering street bridges and ef
fectually cutting off travel between
different parts of the city. The elec
tric light plant early was deluged with
six feet of water. Stoppage of the cur
rent left two interurban cars and their
passengers stranded between McAles
ter and Hartshorne.
" Police and volunteer rescue workers
worked until a late hour removing
families whose homes were threaten
ed with destruction by the water.
Flood conditions were general
throughout Eastern Oklahoma, accord
ing to reports reaching here, which
said thousands of fertile" acres had
been inundated by heavy rains and
much damage occasioned in the oil
fields by the wrecking of derricks and
machinery. .

A COMPARISON
They talk about the country jake
A comin' into town,
So very green and seedy, -
'And how gawky he stands around,
A-gazin' at the awful sights
He's never seed before
And a-running' from the street car
Oh! you'd think him loony, shore.
To hear 'era tell about him ,
How very queer he acts - '
A-lookin' at the sky scrapers
An' gazin' at the tracks;
But you never hear a single word
About the City Guy
A-goin' out upon the farm
To rest awhile Oh, my!
He has each very httle room
He calls our field the yard,
He talks about our "Cotolene"
When it's genuine hog's lard;
He thinks the soil is dirty
But you ought to see him eat
The taters that grew in it
The turnips and the beet.
He thinks farm 'work is simple
But you'd almost bust a lung
When he tries to hitch both horses
Tn tliA atwI rf waonn tsmonip.
He don't know wnat tne narrow is
The binder or the plow
An' he can't tell a fattenin' hog
From our best Jersey cow.
He don't know how to set a hen
Or how to plant the grain
He don't seem to know enuf
To come in when it rains.
But my ! you orter see him eat
? The. fruit, the ham and egg
Hot biscuits and fried chicken
And buttermilk by the keg.
He acts just like he's out of jail
But guess he means no harm
But don't you think he's just as bad
As the Greenhorn from the farm?
