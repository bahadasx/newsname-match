The Habit of Taking Cold
With many people taking cold
is a habit, but fortunately one
that is easily broken. Take a
cold sponge bath every morning
when you first get out of bed
not ice cold, but a temperature
of about 9CK F. Also sleep with
your window up. Do this and
vou will seldom take cold. When
-you do take cold take Chamber
lain's Cough Remedy and get
; rid of it as quickly as possible.
Obtainable everywhere.
