STILL PREVAIL AT THE Eg
ITY CASH GROCERY
405-407 LEMON ST. S
In a former issue I announced a
Reduction Sale for the purpose of
reducing the very large stock of
case goods which we were carrying.
As I have commenced my cam
paign for the office of County
School Superintendent, and will
necessarily be absent from my
business more or less, and the in
surance carried not being sufficient
to fully cover the stock, I decided
to reduce the stock so that I need
not be unduly worried during my
absence.
The sale is still on so that any
one buying case goods now at our
store will secure the decided re
duction in price. The stock is
diminishing, but there is still an
opportunity for you to be 'one of
the fortunate ones an opportunity
not often offered in groceries.
't
And we wish to add that while
our stock will be reduced generally,
the variety will be kept to standard

THE GREAT COMMONER'
TO SPEAKJN PALATKA
Henry Hutchinson Secures
Mr. Bryan's Consent to
Speak in Palatka.
During his recent short stop for
breakfast in Palatka, while en route
for Gainesville, County Clerk Henry
riutcninson wno nas ;aiways peen a
warm admirer, was invited by Mr.
Bryan to join the great commoner in
a motor .-trip to the University city.
It was while on that trip that Mr.
Hutchinson secured a promise from
Mr. Bryan that he would come here
on the first opportunity.
Early this week Mr. Hutchinson re
ceived a letter from Mr. Bryan stat
ins that there were two days open:
his first choice was Saturday, Feb.
12th; his second choice Friday, Feb.
11th. Mr. Hutchinson immediately
took the matter ud with the Woman's
Club, under whose auspices the lec
ture will be given, and the ladies
have made arrangements by which it
can now be definitely stated that
Hon. William Jennings Bryan, three
times candidate of the democratic
party for president of the United
States, Secretary ot btate in resi
dent Wilson's cabinet, and by all Am
ericans friends and political ene
mies alike conceded to be the fore
most platform orator in the country,
will deliver an address in Palatka on
Friday evening. February 11th.
Mr. Bryan delivered an address in
this city some six years ago. Those
who heard the great orator on that oc
casion will rejoice that the opporta
nity is coming to tlicm again. At
that time Mr. Bryan also delivered an
afternoon address at Crescent City
The one defect here is that Palatka
has no auditorium of sufficient capa
city to seat the people who are bound
to flock to thj -it on the occasion
arid who will want ta hear the great
commoner.
Mr. Bryan will be accompanied if
Palatka by Mrs. Bryan and their ten-
year old gradson. From here they
will make the trip up the Ocklawaha
river.
On Friday afternoon, Feb. 11th, the
Woman's Club will give a reception
in the Putnam House parlors for Mrs.
Bryan.
The tickets for Mr. Bryan's lecture
in the evening will be 50 cents.

MEETS SUDDEN DEATH
At Hands of Schoolmate
Who "Didn't Know it
Was Loaded."
Palatkans have been stirred to the
depths of their sympathetic natures
over the untimely death 01 morgan,
the 16-year old son of Mr. and Mrs.
T. M. Hyers, at Micanopy last in
dav eveniner.
His death was due to the play of a
schoolmate who pointed a supposedly
unloaded gun at young Hyers ana
nulled the trigger. The first barrel
was unloaded, Dut tne second was
loaded and the charge entered Mor
gan Hyers' breast, killing him instant-
Four or live montns ago ivir. ami
Mrs. Hyers and the family moved to
Micanopy, the move being necessary
for the convenience of Mr. Hyers,
who k a locomotive engineer in the
employ of the A. C. L. The family
had lived in Palatka many years and
are nigniy esteemed, xne young
man whose death resulted from this
accident, was a special favorite with
a large circle of young people. He
was born in this city and was tne twin
brother of Jack Hyers. His sister,
Miss Thelma Hyers, was also a social
favorite here: in Micsnopy thesS
young people were taking their nat
ural place in social activities.
Three hours before his death Mor
gan had been engaged in a game of
basket ball with the young people of
MicanoDV. He was on a social er
rand at the time of his death.
He went, 'tis said, to call on
schoolmate to discuss a surprise event
being planned for their teacher.
These preliminaries being completed,
the boys began discussing what girls
they would escort. A certain youn,
lndv was suggested for Morgan and
he stepped to the telephone to make
an engagement witn ner. warn uan
tleson, another schoolmate who was
standing by, said to Morgan as he
stepped to the teiepnone, sso you

same time and with frivolous intent,
mVknri ud a supposedly unloaded gun
which he pointed at Morgan. He
pulled or; trigger, and as he expected,
it Hiil not fire: the second trigger,
however, was different; death was in
stantaneous.
The funeral was held at Micanopy
on Saturday afternoon, quite a num
ber of family friends from Palatka
attending, among whom were Mrs.

New Organization to Erect Sumptuous
Club House with all Club Features. '
The once celebrated Florida resort,
Orange Springs, is coming into its
own again, and unless we greatly
mistake, the health giving proper
ties of the waters of the great
springs will soon be discussed in tha
social life of the metropolis, and the
place, with its great club, one of the
real social attractions of Florida's
winter.
James R. Murphy, who recent
ly returned from New York City,
when seen yesterday reported that
he had consummated the sale of l.UUU
acres of land in the vast holding in
Putnam and Marion counties of the
Florida Farms and Homes ,Inc, for
$30,000 to the Ocklawaha Hunting
and Fishing Club of Orange Springs,
incorporated under the laws ot Flori
da. The land is purchased for the
propagation of game m that territory,
ine iormation 01 tnis ciuu is me
result of recent visits of E. D,
DeWitt. of New York City, general
Manager of the Editor and Publisher,
and Marshall Geer, of the New
York Cotton Exchange, both of whom
were entertained on the Etowah.
Noah Tilghman's boat on cruises up
the St. Johns and Ocklawaha rivers
where the ticturesaue scenery, the
wonderful springs at Orange Springs
and the hunting and fishing created
the lasting impression that the coun
try hereabouts was truly a sports
man's paradise and the place where
real recreation and relaxation could
be had.
The officers of the club are
Edwin D. DeWitt of New York City,
President. John W. Ledbetter of
Rome, Georgia, 1st Vice-President,
Marshall Geer of Short Hills, N. J.,
2 Vice-President and W. T. Led
better of Palatka. Secretary
A number of prominent memoers
of the New York Stock Exchange and
New York Cotton Exchange have in
tprested themselves in the club.
The club will be run on very higi:
class l:nes and will probably be in
charge of John Barron, who was
formerly associated as steward and
manager of many of the big clubs
throughout the North and East.
Mr. Murphy has been enter-
taininc auite a number of sports
men, all of whom have gone back with
the one idea that this is the greatest
hunting and fishing territory they
have ever visited.
The membership of the club will
be for the rod and gun enthusiasts
and those who love the chase and the
club will be open for their families
where they can enjoy bathing in the
health giving waters of . Orange
Snrinsrs in the fnidst of winter, and
boating, canoing and fishing on the
numerous lakes surrounding Orange
Springs as well as the Ocklawaha
rivpr and the best of hunting of all
kinds in season and truly enjoy a life
of "Out m the open" m Florida s
haltnv climate.
John W. Ledbetter who has just
returned to Palatka from New York
Citv to look after a number of de
tails in connection with the club's af
fairs reports that without any solici
tation the applications for member-
shins have already reached numbers
to insure the absolute success of the
rlnh
The architecture of the club will be
in keeping with its location in the
beautiful grove of sturdy live oaks,
overhanging with shaggy Spanish
moss that lends a charm and beautiful
picturesqueness to the springs. It
will be a three story semi-bungalow
effect of the California type and con
tain 50 rooms with private bath3,
snacious lobby, porches, sun parlors
outdoor sleeping porches and have all
modern appointment
The news of this undertaking 13
very gratifying inasmuch as it means
the erection of a sumptuous club
house that will cost $30,000, to be
erected immediately adjacent to the
spring at Orange Springs.
Mavnicke & Franke, architects of
New York, are to draw plans for thi
club house and the decorations are to
be designed by an expert in that line,
so that they will be in keeping with
the grandeur, beauty and picturesque
ness of the surroundings at Orange
Springs.
The springs have been put in per
fect shape. A beautiful concrete cir
cular wall 100 feet in diameter and a
spillway,, also a promanade have
been completed by Mr. Thomas Shinn
of Palatka who was awarded the con
tract jointly by J. W. Townsend,
of Lake Butler, and James R. Mur
phv representing the Florida Farms
& Homes, Inc., who are the joint own
ers of the spring together with 40
acres af land in the town site.
The improvements already under
contemplation for Orange Springs
have caused more speculation in real
estate circles in that particular lo
cality than has been heard of in many
a year. Mr. Murphy is receiving a
creat manv applications for town lots.
He will shortly let a contract for the
erection of an office building an' a
number of houses for his employees.
Needless to say, we wish Mr. Mur
phy well in his undertaking, as he has
manifested a very progressive spirit
since coming here, and we are sure
that his activities, in the section of

WHY IT PAYS TO READ THE ADS.
Mrs. Housewife, if you picked up
your favorite family paper this evening and
saw a new baking powder advertised, would
you try that brand tomorrow? Hardly !
Why? Eecause you do not know the brand.
How do you become familiar, then, with
most of your household necessities? Why,
through advertising. An article that you
see advertised continuously appeals to you.
Your good sense tells you that it must be
right, else it could not remain on the mar
ket. And what advertising is to an indi
vidual article it is to a business institution.
Advertising draws trade to a store. If that
store continues to advertise, it is satisfy
ing its customers. , No business can amount
to much without advertising, nor can ad
vertising do any business any good unless
that business lives up to its advertise
ments. Here, then, is plainly seen why it
pays to trade with the continuous adver
isers. That is the secret of the mail order
business the Mail Order Houses keep their
advertisement before the people all the time
in the form of catalogues.
"BILL!" PARKER STIRS
POLITICAL PALATKA
In a Series of Addresses
And Puts Certain Politi
cians "On the Blink."
"Billy" Parker, a public speaker of
fervancy and power who recently
came to Honda to assist in the cam
paign against the Papacy and the
"Holy Roman Empire," and who has
been stirring things up politically at
Tampa, Jacksonville and other points
in the State, made Palatka a visit
last week with the same brilliant suc
cess which has been his everywhere.
Hij addresses in the Howell theater
on Sunday afternoon and night filled
the house find many were grouped
about the street unable to gain ad
mission. Those who were present
said the crowd was in sympathetic ac
cord with the speaker. Pastors of sev
eral protestant churches were pre
sent as were lawyers, doctors, mer
chants, clerks, mechanics and school
boys.
The first meetings Friday and Sat
urday nights were for "men only"
and admission was by ticket. These
were held in Red Men's hall. The
hall was filled to its capacity.
This nrovement for which Mr. Par
ker stands is not confined to Floridi,
but has been for a year spreading to
all the States. Here in Palatka the
cause has been espoused by a large
number, a great many of whom are
citizens of a high class. Many con
servative men deplore the movement
as uncalled for, believing that appeals
to religious prejudice and the mixture
of politics with religious questions is
opposed to the spirit of religious tol
erance for which we as a nation
stand. Others, who are affiliated
with the religion attacked, are natu
rally resentful, and in some cases are
making foolish moves looking toward
the suppression of the movement.
This is unwise, especially in a country
where freedom of speech is guaran
teed. Movements made by this class
and intended to block the onrush only
assists in its spread.
Mr. Parker is a radical more so
than the great body of agitators re
sposible for the present movement.
He says so himself.
The Parker lectures do no harin.
Truth is truth and must prevail. If
Parker states an untruth, it will react
on both himself and the movement.
If he states a truth, no one is injured,
on the contrary the country benefits.
This iso ne country where the church
and State are and must be kept sep
arate. It is a country in which it has
been said that "a man is permitted to
make more kinds of a d fool 01
himself on the subject of religion than
any other one thing in the world. '
In his addresses here Mr. 1'arlwr
held some of our local legislators up
to ridicule, which is one of the bless
ed penalties one must pay for being
a politician, or near-politician, as the
case may be.
'Nother Game of Basket Ball.
The strong team from the Gaines
ville high school will come Saturday
night to try issues with the Putnam
high school team.
Our boys are encouraged to oeneve
they can walk away with this game
after the strong showing made
atrainst the team from the Deaf and
Dumb Institute. All who saw that
game are picking the P. H. S. boys as
winners in the Saturday night con
test. All that is needed for a successful
athletic event is a big crowd of en
thusiastic rooters. Come out and en
courage the home bovs.
