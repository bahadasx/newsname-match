ONE-HALF PRICE
This is our large annual sale, and we have been putting on a similar one each year for a number of
years. During these sales we are always crowded to the limit. For this annual occasion we employ all
of the experienced sales-people we can possibly get on a short notice. If you are not waited on the
. moment you step into the store we ask your indulgence, and please do not keep our sales-people occu
pied in an unnecessary conversation, as other customers may be waiting for them. Everything must
move lively so that our many customers may have proper service. We assure you that our sales ser
vice will be the best it is possible forus to have, ao please be patient, and remember we will do our very
best to serve you right. If you have a complaint to make, kindly make it at the office promptly.
When Summers puts on a
sale, everyone knows it is a
bonafide proposition because
their reputation, 37 years of
successful merchandising is
at stake.
