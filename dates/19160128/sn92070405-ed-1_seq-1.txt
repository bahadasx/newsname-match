Goad Hews For the City
Santa Fe, January 24 Neil B.
Samson, engineer in the employ
of the State engineer's office, will
leave here tomorrow for Grant
county to make a survey for the
proposed State highway connect
ing Silver City and Lordsburg.
There is much sentiment in that
county in favor of this road, and
the greater part ofGrant county's
share of the highway bonds pro
ceeds probably will be spent on
on it. The present road is in
very bad shape and in construct
ing the new highway the route
probably will be changed con
siderably. 0
Strike Is Settled

SHOOTING NEAR PYRAMID
Sunday afternoon about 2:30
o'clock George Haydon and Robert
M. Reynolds were putting up the
frame work of a goat herder's
shack about a mile south of Pyra
mid peak when Eugene Curley
Holland of a neighboring cow
camp came up to them, inquiring
as to their mission on the ground.
Mr. Haydon informed him that
they were putting up a shack to
protect their herder during the
severe weather. Mr. uoiiana is
said to have thereupon laid his
claim to the ground stating that he
was holding the property with his
squatter's right. It was alleged
that hot words ensued between the
two men over the right of posses
sion of the ground and it is alleged,
Mr. Haydon turned to walk
away Rolland pulled a six shooter,
pointed it at Haydon and snapped
che trigger. The gun failed to dis
charge. As Mr. Haydon turned to
face Rolland the latter again pull
ed the trigger. This time the gun
discharged, the bullet entering Mr.
Haydon's left arm above the elbow
shattering the bones. According
to an eye witness Mr. Rolland stay
ed at the scene of the shooting un
til Mr. Reynolds had hitched the
horses to the wagon and helping
Mr. Haydon onto the seat, drove
to Lordsburg. Dr. M. M. Crocker
attended the injured man and' ob
tained passage for him on an east-
bound freight train to Deming, all
passenger trains being annulled.
At Deming an operation was per
formed by Dr. Swope at ther hospi
tal and it is possible that the arm
will toe saved. Mrs. Haydon fol
lowed her husband to Deming by
automobile.
"Curley" Rolland came in to
Lordsburg Sunday night and on
Monday morning about 9 o'clock
was placed under arrest. His bond
was fixed at $1,000 by Justice of the
Peace C. W. Marsalis. Bond was
furnished and February 3 set for
the date of preliminary hearing. A
wide-spread interest is being
snown m the case.

Many complaints are being made
oi autoists in LorasDurs not carry

olving the Low
Cost of Buying
Everybody is talking about the high
cost of living, and racking their
brains for a solution.
That's easy ! All you have to do is to
, solve the "Low cost of buying."
Study carefully the Quality and the
Price before parting with your
money, for one is as essential as the
other. A few pennies saved on each
article used by the average family
would amount to a considerable
sum in the run of a year; it reduces
the cost of living.
We have solved the "Low Cost of
Buying" from the manufacturer,
and YOU will solve it when you
come to us, for "WE are slicing off
the pennies for you which the man
ufacturer had to slice off for us.
Meet us face to face, and you will go
home with a smile.

ROUTENEWS
Owing to inclement weather and
mpassable roads the motor-cade
of autoists from Lordsburg, Dun-
an, Safford, Bowie and other
points in Arizona was postponed,
however, a committee from Lords
burg and several from Safford put
n some hard blows in LI Paso this
week during the American Nation
al Live Stock Association conven
tion telling El Paso of the pro
posed changes in the Borderland
route and the actual road work
west of Lordsburg, tending to make
the coastwise road from this city
one of the best in the southwest.
Following the call of Lordsburg
to the road enthusiasts in Arizona
a large number of responses were
received but owing to the condi
tions of the roads all concerned
gave up the proposed motor trip.
Word from Duncan
Joseph I. Cohn, secretary of the
Duncan Improvement Club in a let
ter to the Lordsburg Chamber of
Commerce, stated that the Duncan
club had called a meeting to talk
over the road matter and gave the
proposed trip its hearty recom
mendation.
Dell Potter Wires
Dell M. Potter of Clifton, wired
an extensive telegram telling of
flood conditions at Clifton making
it impossible for a delegation from
that place to be present, and giv
ing l,ordsburg assurance of Clif
ton's hearty cooperation. Mr. Pot
ter stated that at a latter date he
is confident gret results will be
obtained from the proposed motor
trip.
K. W. Smith, secretary of the
bafford, Ariz. Chamber of Com
merce advised that a meeting of
the board of directors of their com
mercial club was held and appoint
ed a delegate to meet the Lordsburg
delegation at EI raso. Globe also
sent delegates to work for their
interests in the Southern National
Highway.
Bowie Responds
J. H. Jaque, Bowie's chief boost
er, published the Lordsburg Cham
ber of Commerce's letter in his
newspaper and also assured Bo
wie's cooperation in the matter of
fair play in coast-bound traffic
Deming Gives Publicitv
The Deming Graphic published
an article in its issue of Friday
telling of Lordsburg's objections
to tne proposed chanire in the Bor
derland and of the auto trin which
was planned for Monday but which
nao to be abandoned.
The El Paso Herald published a
very complete article telling of
the road work now being done on
the Borderland and ocean-to-ocean
route, which was very valuable ad
vertising for Lordsbursr and will
do much good in letting autoists
know of the excellent road now
under construction.
A special article sent out from
Tombstone, Ariz., and published in
the Bisbee Review comments upon
the Liberal's protest to the change
in the Borderland.
Thanks to Arizona Press
During the past four days the
newspapers along the Borderland
Route in 3outhern Arizona have
been publishing press dispatches
and special articles sent out bv
The Western Liberal telling of
the beginning oí the belated work
in re-bui!ding the famous Border
land Route from Lordsburg to
bteins to Kodeo following the
mountain ridges. The newspap
ers of Douglas, Bisbee, Tombstone
and other points have been kind
enough to publish Lordsburg
claim, and it is appreciated here,
For instance, The Tombstone
Epitaph says as follows :
"Lordsburg comes to time at
last, as the following wire to the
El Paso Herald will show. It is
probable that the Arizona motor
cade would not have taken place
last week had Lordsburg show
the spirit that is evident from
the dispatch below. Lordsburg
must realize that lucson, lomb
stone, Bisbee, Lowell, Warren
and Douglas want and must have,
yea, will have fair play even if
they have to go over into New
Mexico and get it bodily. How
ever, it .appears from the follow
ing that Lordsburg now realizes
that with the connections that
the Borderland Route will have
from the east, it is for them to
get in and get the traffic by their
town. If the road from Steins to
Rodeo is to be the one best road,
then bully for Lordsburg." The
article in question follows.

week.
The best job printing at the

RENCII WRITES
ON THE ROADS
James A. French, state engineer,
sent the following letter to the
Lordsburg Chamber of Commerce
which is self-explanatory and
which shows Mr. French's loyal
nterest in this city and southern
New Mexico:
Mr. Faris V. Bush,
Lordsburg Chamber of
Commerce,
Lordsburg, N. M.
Dear Sir:
I have yours of the 18th, in which
ou invite me, at the request of the
hamber of commerce .of Lords-1
burg to join the motorists and good !
oads enthusiasts of Lordsburg,
N. M., Safford, Duncan, Solomon-
ville, Clifton, San Simon, Bowie
and Wilcox, Arizona, on a motor-
ade to Deming and El Paso, leav-
ng Lordsburg January 24: your
object being to retard the action
of Douglas and Bisbee to turn off
he Borderland route east of Lords
burg and go via Hachita. I n5-
íced by last night 8 paper there
was about ten feet of snow at
Lordsburg, and no doubt by the
4th it will be practically ímpos-
bie lor traveling in that country.
However, I have just returned
from the southern part of the
tate, and it will be impossible for
ne to join the party at this time.
ind as stated above, do not believe
will be feasible owing to the
storms that have been all over that
iiart of the country recently.
However, wish to state that the
El Paso and Arizona contingents
requested me to consider that road
from Rodeo to Hachita and to So-
orro, but wish to state that I ex
pressed my opinion that all the
state fund would go on the Silver
City-Lordsburg road. The fact is
:hat probably from Rodeo to Ha-
hita would not be very expensive
road to put into shape, but I feel
atished that neither the state nor
jounty at this time can do any
work between Rodeo and Hachita.
t is very likely that any future
oad that is well built and main
tained will be the logical line of
;ravel for travelers cominar from
Douglas and Bisbee or from Clif
ton, Arizona, goinir to El Paso
would follow the better roads. Be-
íeve it will be the objective to
open this road' from Deminjr to
Silver City and Lordsburg, both
y the county and state in the near
future, and disregard the other
Very truly yours,
