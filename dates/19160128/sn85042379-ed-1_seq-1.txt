FIRST NATIONAL BANK
OBSERVES ANNIVERSARY
LOCAL BANKING INSTITUTION FOUNDED JANU
ARY 26,1891—SUCCESS CROWNS EFFORTS.
BIG FACTOR IN DEVELOPING CITY
From SmaU Beginning Biuik Has Experienced Remarkable Growth

i public.
On January 26, 1891, twenty-five.
years ago, banking began i| Glasgow, ;
when what is now the FKst National '
bank first opened its doors to the [
For a quarter of a century the bank |
has survived and has prospered. The,
same men who founded and managed 1
it are still at the helm, and its rise j
and development has been just as rap
id as that of the city and the sur- j
rounding country. It has grown and.
prospered with the growth and pros-1
perity of the Milk river valley and is '
today one of the strongest financial :
institutions in the country, occupying |
one of the finest and handsomest
buildings in the state, which was built
a year ago for its use on the site
of the little wooden shack that
was the Valley county court house, j
Little did John M. and R. M. Lewis J
imagine that the little bank that in
1891 occupied a small corner of the
store of John M. Lewis' mercantile es
tablishment, would, within a quarter
of a century, become one of the big
gest and strongest banks in the state
of Montana, nor that the desolate
prairies that extended for miles on
either side of the town would be peo
pled with prosperous farmers and
• archers. At the time of its founding
: t was the only financial institution
between Spokane and Minot on the
main line of the Great Northern and
the Canadian Pacific and Northern
Pacific railways, a territory which
;
embraced but few more than e thou
sand inhabitants, and a bank wag
hardly a necessity at that time.
The entire business of the bank in
the earliest days of its existence was
conducted entirely by R. M. Lewis,
who is now vice president of the in
stitution. Not only was he able to
look after the banking end, but he
handled the books for the general
store and also waited on customers
when necessity demanded. The first
depositor was James W. Wedum, who
was then associated with John M.
Lewis in the general store business.
Mr. Wedum is still a depositor in the
bank, and is also a member of the
board of directors. His first deposit
was $220, which represented the sum
total of his wealth at that time.
The town at that time was
posed of about twenty or thirtj
fronts, but they were all typical struc-"!
log shacks which housed the inhabit-i
ants of the city. Some of the busi-1
ness places on Front street had boardl
fronts, but they were all typical struc
tures of the time, when the cow
punchers would come riding up the
street in a cloud of dust and two box
cars would have obstructed the view'the
of tho town from either side.
In the early nineties Havre was
just beginning to rise above the
prairie sod. The main line of the
Great Northern had reached Havre
then and yards were being put in
and the biggest part of the population
was composed of men in the con
struction camp. The line from Havre
west to the coast was started in 1890,
and many mushroom towns sprang
up along the line, which have since
passed into history.
Starting a bank in those times
when the only inhabitants in the
country were cattlemen, cow-punch
ers and a few railroad men was
ja mighty precarious proposition, but
the bank of the Lewis brothers came
through the ordeal with flying colors,
were only about twenty ranch
ers within a radius of twenty miles
of the town then, and the surround
ing country was dotted here and there
with ranches and cow camps.
In 1900 the bank found its old quar
ters too small and a one-story brick
building was built next to the Lewis
Wedum store and this housed the in
stitution until a year ago when the
present structure was erected.
With the beginning of the twentieth
century the country began to advance,
more small ranchers and stockmen
coming in, but the high tide of immi
gration did not begin until 1908 when
people came from all parts of the
United States and Canada and settled
on 320 acres of Uncle Sam's domain.
During the early part of its history
Glasgow had made a slow but steady
growth, but the improvements were
few and it still remained the same
old frontier town.
With the coming of the farmer the
city began to experience its first
boom. The rush to settle on home
steads in this part of the state con
tinued, and despite the predictions
the old timers and cattlemen that
sage brush was the only thing that
would grow, the settlers built their
shacks, broke the sod and now many
of those who were here with the first
rush have fine farms and ride around
st
as the land in the valley was taken,
in automobiles. The farmers were
the making of the country and the
city of Glasgow, for with their coming
came new business enterprises. At
this time some of the bench lands aie
»nsidered the most valuable in the
country, but the first settlers settled
in the river bottoms and the benches
were shunned as dry, arid spots. But
j as the land in the valley was taken,
j the settlers who came later were
; forcea. to go on the benches, and now
some of the most valuable farms in
view'the county are to be found there.
With tho growth of the country aifd
the city, other banking institutions
came here, but the old First National
kept pace with the development and
its founders realized that they had
started a mighty institution in the
corner of the mercantile store in 1891.
For twenty-five years the found
ers of the bank have reposed utmost
confidence in the belief that the coun
try some day would be one of the gar
den spots of the northwest, and they
still believe that the era of develop
ment has but only begun, and that the
next twenty-five years will witness
even greater changes than the period
from 1891 to 1916, which was a tran
sition from the sage brush to
waving wheat fields.
The fact that Glasgow has
the
had
strong financial institutions has been
a mighty factor in the development
of the city. The fact that our banks
in capital, surplus and deposits are
strong are the best indicators of our
prosperity, and an idea can be gained
of what is being done in the commer
cial field. It can be said with confi
dence that, after going over the of

Abstract company will be let in a few
I days, as soon as a few changes are
j made in the plans and speeificatione
' by the architect.
| The date of opening the bids wa
|
of

ing to the delay in the train service,

Five bids were received en the erec
tion of the building, with the Leig
land-Kleppe Company of Great Fallu
having the lowest bid. The cost of
the building as first estimated was
$75,000.00, but the bids were far above
that figure, and the cost of the build
ing as it will be erected will be about

were received for the club rooms, with
and without furnishings. If the busi

SAYS HUGHES CANT REFUSE.
Chicago, Jan. 25—Charles D. Hilles,
chairman of the republican national
committee, before leaving for New
York last Tuesday after attending
the session of the sub committee on
arrangements for the party's national
convention, discussed political ques
tions including the possible candidacy
of Colonel Roosevelt for the republi
can nomination for president.
"All the information 1 have is to tho
effect that Colonel Roosevelt is not a
candidate for the republican nomina
tion," Chairman Hillej* said. "lie ha«
declined to permit his name to go on
the primary ballot in the only three
states where it has been suggested—
Minnesota, Nebraska and Michigan.
"In the statement issued by the pro
gressive national committee, it waa
made plain that any reasonably satis
factory man would be acceptable as
the republican nominee. They insist
ed that they meant just what they
said and we will take the statement on
its face value. I think we will be able
to nominate a man who will be satis
factory to all elements of the party
and that our candidate will be
"In regard to Justice Hughes no
one knows just what his attitude is
today, toward the presidency. In dis
cussing the subject with a friend in
1912 Justice Hughes said when he
went on the United States supreme
court bench he took the veil and rer
nounced the world.
"There is no man big enough to re
fuse the presidency, in my opinion.
If he were nominated without his con
sent I have no idea what he would
do."
