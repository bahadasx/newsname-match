Non-Partisan
League Strong
Movement Has Swept the State
It is Planned To Have a Gtfal
Convention and at fiat Conven
tion History Will Be Made—Fargo
Should invite Farmers.
(Fargo Forum)
The Non-partisan league—what is
it?
The question has been asked a
good many times the past year. Who
is back of it, what do they want and
"what they intend to do? are some of
•'•the many questions that have been
asked regarding it. Some of these
queries have been asked The Forum,
and is must be confessed that until
recently The Forum knew little about
it.
Today, however, The Forum can
••answer the first question. The Non
partisan league is an uprising of the
farmers of North Dakota ALMOST
TO A MAN
Perhaps that was not the aim of
the men who originated the name
and who launched the movement. Un
doubtedly this movement has gone far
beyond the. wildest expectations of
those who set it going.
But it hat spread like wildfire and
has swept the state of North Dakota.
Today it is the dominant power in
political affairs of the state. Don't
make any mistake about that. The
.Non-partisan league is going to make
a housecleaning -in North Dakota
politics or The Forum is greatly mis
taken. '-f
The Forum does not know who the
leaders of ths organization are, but
it does know who the rank and file
are and in them this paper has the
utmost confidence and for them it
has the greatest respect.
The rank and file of the Non-par­
tisan
league are th farmers, of North
Dakota. From the Red River valley
to the far Missouri slope, from South
Dakota to the Canadian boundary,
like the minute men of the revolution
they are ready for revolt. And they
are in deadly earnest. They are out
for a purpose and they do not pro
pose to be sidetracked.
The farmers propose to form a
great organization. In every county
"there is to be a county convention.
That convention will be made up of
delegates elected from th hundreds of
local organizations of the Non-parti
san league. Each county convention
and these delegate's will be pledged
to a certain program of action.
This state convention promises to
be the most representative gathering
of farmers ever held in the state of
Nqrth Dakota.
These men will not be radicals, or
socialists or anarchists as some peo
ple seem to believe. They will be the
farmers of the state in convention
assembled.
Any city in North Dakota ought to
be proud to entertain such a gather
ing. It will be a gathering that is
going to make history. It will map
out a definite program, the object of
•which will'be to make the farmer in
dependent of the grain speculator of
the "loanshark" banker who flourish
es in some of the newer sections of
the state of the meat trust that dom
inates the live stock industry and of
the cheap, petty grafting politician
who uses his office to build his own
political fortunes instead of working
in the interest of his constituents.
The Forum believes that great
things may come out of this move
ment for the state of North Dakota
and that the city of Fargo should
extend to the farmers of the state
a cordial- invitation to come here for
their convention, promising them not
only a cordial welcome and the best
entertainment the city affords, but
also the hearty sympathy and the
active co-operation of the citizens of
Fargo, in this effort to secure thhe
political and economic freedom of
the citizens of the state.
Library Ball
Thursday, Feb. 10
The members of the Beach Wom
an's Club will again be hostesses at
a Library Ball to be given Feb. 10th.
These annual events have been the
most enjoyable given to the Beach
public and the one this year promises
to be the best ever given.
A Japanese scheme of decoration
will be carried out, and when the
doors are opened one may easily im
agine he is entering the Flowery
Kingdom.
The greater part of the expense
of the library is met by the receipts
of this ball, and you can show your
appreciation of the library and of the
work and ladies, by attendisg the
dance and helping to carry on this
public institution.
Missionary Con
vention at Fargo
Fargo, N. D. Jan. 26—Twelve Hun
dred men of North Dakota and west
ern Minnesota this week enrolled
themselves and paid the fee to atcen
the Laymen's Missionary Convention
now being held in the Masonic Tem
ple. The Convention opened with a
great banquet Wednesday evening
which was the greatest thing of its
kind ever held in the Northwest. Reg
istrations kept coming in so rapidly
that on Monday befoi'e the Conven
tion opened Wednesday arrangements
had to be made for an overflow ban
quet which was held in the Knight's
of Columbus Hall Both banquets
were very successful and the speakers
were carried from ont building to the
other in automobiles The theme for
the addresses of the evening was
"The Coming World Democracy," the
speakers were, Fred B. Fisher, Her
bert Johnson and Morris W. Ehnes.
Between 90 and 100 towns in North
Dakota and Minnesota sent delegates
to this convention, this being the
highest number of towns outside the
convention city represented at any
convention of the series of 15 Boston
Mass., holding the honor up to this
time.
One of the great attractions was
Gilbert, the Moving picture man, who
sustained his reputation of being thc
greatest moving picture star of the
country. All the other speakers mea
sured up to the reputation which they
had won in the East during the fall
campaign.
It is safe to say that never before
in the history of the Northwest has
such a great convention been held
either for a religious or secular pur
pose. The churches of this whole
territory have received such an im
petus as will put them in a position
which it would have taken years to
,'ork to in the ordinarv wav
A thin, sickly, little man enter
ed one of the stores in one of our
small towns recently and quietly
seated himself a convenient chair.
One of the clerks approached asd
asked if he wished to purchase any
thing. "Oh, no," said the man, "I
just dropped in for a few minutes."
After half an hour had passed the
manager of the store, becoming cur
ious, approaehed him and asked what
could be done for him. "Why noth
ing that I know of," said the man,
"you see I have nervous prostration
and the doctor told me to stay in a
quiet place. Nothing that you do not
advertise I thought this would be
fine." Let me tell you it was any
thing but quiet there for five min
utes. The poor little man found him
self in the street wishing that he had
landed on a feather bed. But the
next week the store surprised itself
with a big display ad in the home
paper.
Firemen Hold
Annual Meeting
The Beach Fire Department held
their annual meeting last Tuesday
Evening at the offices of the Golden
alley State Bank for the purpose
of electing officers for the ensuing
year and also transacting other bus
iness which came before the depart
ment of the city.
Although the night was very stor
my there were 22 of the 26 members
of the department present, which
shows that they are much interested
and proud to belong to this, one of
the best volunteer departments in the
state.
Mr. Rosenberg in a few well chos
en words expressed the sentiment of
the company when he made the mo
tion to retain Mr. Fuller as chief of
the department for another year, as
was shown when he was chosen by
a unanimous vote. The other offi
cers were also reelected namely: C.
C. Darrington, Asst. Chief Theo.

chosen as delegates to attend the
Fireman's State Convention which
will be held in Fargo some time next
June.
Louis Iluber was voted into the

a
ins
new member at this
meeting. Light refreshemnts, cof
fee and sandwiches were served aft
er the eeting and the members as
usual enjoyed a very pleasant even-

New Information
Against Joker
Minot Optic Reporter: A new in
formation has been filed against Ar
nold llileinan, the young man who
saturated a drunken man with wood
alcohol and then set him on fire in a
spirit of smartuleckness, which re
sulted in the disastrous fire that de
stroyed the Rocll-Blakely block a few
days ago and left a score of people
destitute because everything thev
had, including their clothing, was de
stroyed. The new information is filed
under a section of thiyriminql stat
ute which provides punishment for
the destruction of the property of an
other. Ho was bound over to the
district court on the latter charge.
It is a regrettable fact that the
lawmakers never contemplated a
crime committed usder such silly con
ditions and inspired by such silly im
pulses as that which produced the fire
is this city. It will be difficult for the
officers to prove malice in the arson
charge which has been lodged agaisst
Ililcman, which would be necessary
to secure convict ion under that
charge. And in order to make punish
ment as certain as possible, they arc
taking a double grip on the matter.
If the arson charge could get past the
technicality, a jury would certainly
render justice and common sense and
find him guiltv.

Hail Ins. Rates
Given Boost
Dickinson P'sss.—The farmers ri
southw.ste, Dak da compri
sing 13 counties, will be up arms
against the old line companies when
they learn that hail insurance rates
for 1016 have been boosted from 8
1-2 to 10 per cent on every $100 of
insurance carried. A meeting of the
general agents was held in New
York when it was agreed to make this
advance.
The rates for the states east of the
Missouri river ar 6 1-2 per cent, the
same as they have been for some
time and for the coining season the
rates in the northwestern portion of
North Dakota, heretofore 7 1-2 per
cent are reduced to correspond with
rates in the eastern and central por
tion.
It is claimed that at least a two
years' average is necessary on which
to base a claim for reduction, and the
fact that hail business in the north
western port on of the state for years
past has shown a profit is the reason
for the reduction of 1 per cent in that
territory
Stark county probably showed a
small profit for the companies in
1015, hut the previous year's business
was quite disastrous. If 1016 proves
a good year for the companies, a re
duction is promised for 1917. Gen
eral agents of companies who were
in Dickinson tlie past week, stated
that Bowman, Slope and Golden Val
ley counties showed a bad record for
!!)]. and it was partly due to the un
favorable hail loss condition in these
counties that caused the advance in
rates for 191(5 in all the southwestern
territory.
An important change for the corn
ing year is a bureau which will mnk^
hail adjustments for all of tthe com
panies. In. this way it is expected
that a large saving in expenseWill be
shown and there will not be a chance
for a fanner to get a big adjustment
when in reality he is only entitled to
a small t,r.c. Such t'lings have hap

commissioner of insurance, that when
more farmers take this insurance the
state will be able to pay nearly or
quite the face value of the policy.

Bridge at Mandan
Across Missouri
Mandan, N. D., Jan. 26.—Geo. J.
Keniston of Beach, worker on the
National Parks Highway association,
who was here last summer in connec
tion with the raising of funds for the
bridge at Medora, in an interview
given The St. Paul Pioneer Press
Dispatch, asserts that action towards
the erection of a $250,000 bridge
over the Missouri between Mandan
and Bismarck will now be taken.
Neither Burleigh county and Bis
marck nor Morton county and Man
dan could stand the expense of this
bridge and funds will be raised in all
towns along the Red Trail from New
York to Spokane.
The Pioneer Press of Sunday says:
With the completion of the bridge
at Medora, N. 1)., across the Little
Missouri river, the next efforts of the
National Parks Transcontinental
Highway association promoters in
this art of the country are to be de
voted to a $250,000 campaign for a
bridge across the Missouri river be
tween Bismarck and Mandan, N I).
This is the last unbridged crossing
on the entire highway, from New
York city through Rochester, Buf
falo, Cleveland, South Bend, Chicago,
Milwaukee. LaCrosse and St. Paul to
Seattle by way of St. Clou!, Moor
head, Fargo, Glendive, Livingston,
Butte, Missoula and Spokane.
"The country from Fallon, Mont, to
Fargo has borne the expense of build
ing the $21,000 bridge at Medora,-'
said George M. Keinston, of Beach,
N. D., a traveling representative of
the highway association, who was in
St. Paul last week.
"The assessable valuation of the
county in which Medora. is located
would have borne only part of the
cost. Several counties worked to
retlier and the bridge is the result.''
The Montana, North Dakota and
Minnesota sections of (lie highway
organization held their ansual meet

ling and Power Company of Mott,
North Dakota. J. P. Larson, one of
the best grain men in this section of
the state is manager. J. M. Johnson
is head miller. With two hustling
grain men like those mentioned above
at the head of the management, suc

Ihe mill is located on the south
side of Cannon Ball river, on the
Milwaukee railroad site. Chas.
Jockson one of the best millwrights
i-:i Minnesota supervised the work.
Mr. Jackson who has erected some
very large mills and inspected many
more made this remark, "The Mott
mill is one of the best in the west
and there is no better equipped mill
in the northwest territory.
The public opening of the mill took
place last Tuesday, January 25, both
ifternoon and evening. A light lun
cheon was served during the open
ing.
The compav handles several grades
of flour the most popular one being
the "Maruqis Cannon Ball and the
"Equity." The flour is now on sale
at local stores and will be sold in
carload lots. It is a home institu
tion and ninans much to Molt and
Mott citizens. And our sister city
is to congratulated upon having pro
cured such an important and profit
able plant.
The spirit of co-operation in
North Dakota is making a very evid
ent showing by the fact that 116
more -opernl iv vi i'r.- \vc?ro
added during the season. Some of
these arc new houses, but the major
ily were obtained by absorbtion and
