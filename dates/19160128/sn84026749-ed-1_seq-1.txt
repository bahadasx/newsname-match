Well Informed Persons See In It
Dlreot .Bearing Upon Con
troversy With Kaiser Over
Lusitania Case.'
Good Faith of Berlin Govern
ment Questioned Some Be
lieve Bernstorff Seeks to
Avoid Settlement.
Grave significance is attached in
official and diplomatic circles to a
statement made by President Wil
son in the course of his speech
last night before the Railroad
Business Association in New York,
warning the public that it is im
possible for the Administration to
forecast what will be the inter
national relations of the United
States in the near future.
In the view of many well-in
formed persons in Washington,
the statement has a direct and in
timate bearing on the unsatisfac
tory situation with respect to the
diplomatic controversy between
this country and Germany over a
settlement of the Lusitania case.
DOUBT ABOUT GERMANY. .
a,heJPreldn, said:
"What I am tryfng' to Impress upon
you now Is that the circumstances of
tne world today are not what they were
yesterday, or what they were In any of
our yesterdays; and that It Is not certain
wnai.tney win bo tomorrow. I cannot
tell you what the elntcrnatlonal rela
tions Of this country will bo tomorrow,
and I use the word literally.
''And I do not dare keep silent and let
the country suppose that tomorrow was
certain to bo as bright as today.
"America will never be the aggressor;
America will always seek to the last
point at whlqh her honor is Involved to
avoid the things which disturb the neaco
of the world.
"But America does not control the cir
cumstances of the world, und we must
he sure that we arc faithful servants of
those things whtfh we love, and aro
ready to defend them against every con
tingency that may affect or Impair
them."
in this connection it was learned to
day that eonio of the President's ad
Msera aro far from satisfied that
Germany is in good faith seeking to
nna a settlement of the Lusitania Issue.
The failure of Count von BernatortT,
me ucrman ambassador, in his last
conference with Secretary of state Lan
sing, to present a communication from
hla government satisfying the demands
of the United States, has caused 'con
siderable irritation. Tho suspicion is
beginning to be felt that the ambassa

Religious Controversy Raised by
Admiral's Letter to Relig
ious Convention.
LONDON', Jan. 2S. The whole contro
versy over the question: "Is God watch
ing this war?" was revived here today
by publication of a letter from Vice
Admiral Beatty appealing for great re
ligious revival in England as a neces
sary step toward victory.
The controversy opened several weeks
ago when the mother of a soldier
Killed In France wrote to a London
paper- "Whore was God when my
boy, with his face gashed by a bayo
net, died In agony on tho battlefield'.''
Clercymen and nffnostlcs clashed In
debates In the London papers for
irore than a week.
The clergymen today were elated
over the stand of Vice Admiral
Keatty. Beattv who married the
daughter of Marshall Field of Chi
cago, commanded the British squad
ron that sank the German Bluecher In
the North Sea.
In Beatty's letter, read at the con
vention or tne aociety for the Propa-
gallon
of Christian
ivnowieage, ne
says
"England still remains to be taken
out of the stupor or self-satisfaction
and complacency into which her
flourishing condition has steeped her.
Until she can be stirred out of this
condition, until a religious revival
tnkes place, Just so long as will the
war continue.
"When she can look on the future
with humbler eyes and a prayer on
her IIijh, then we can hegln to count
tho days toward tho end. Your so
ciety Is helping to this end and so Is
helping to bring: the war to a success

Latest advices say the Appam car

On previous trips northwestward
along the African coast, the Appam
made several stops, picking up passen
gers at some ports and discharging
them at others For this reason, It Is
stated, the exact number of nassenaor

Helpless On Dates.
Mrs. Mohr wa helpless on th
mutter of dates. The year of her own
mothers death was vague In her
mind, and she asked tlnie n.sraln to bo
allowed to explain, instead of glvln?
direct replies.
Rice adrcMed Mrs. Mohr ns "Ma

admtted that hr own mother's name

was no relationship between them
oivl denied ever having satd that the

"I never told Maty to shoot Dr.
Mohr," Mrs. Mohr testified," and I
nevr told the servants at the New

Mary to use two bullets If one did
not do the work."
Rice asked If Mrs. Mchr did no( at
tempt to use the McConzHle girl's
assault charge to a'd In her suit for

The defense. It Is learned. Is dis
