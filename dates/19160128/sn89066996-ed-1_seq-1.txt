Through Head
Prominent Farmer of Liberty Town
fthlp Makes Careful Preparation
to End Life,
A. M. Wallace, a well-to-do farmer
and a citizen who stood high in the
estimation of his neighbors and all
who knew him, died by his own hands
at his home near Libertyville Wed
nesday morning, January 26th.
On Monday he sent for his brother,
W. C. Wallace, who lives at Syenite,
to come and see him. For some years
his mind had been somewhat clouded
at times, and in the course of con
versation with his brother, he said,
'If anything should happen to m-
I don't know that it will t want you
to look after Julie," his wife. "There
is plenty for her to live on."
His brother stayed on with him
that night, Tuesday and Tuesday
night, during which time he appeared
to be in a normal condition. At break
fast he excused himself from the ta
ble in a casual manner, his wife and
brother not imagining that he had
anything tragic in his mind. He
walked into the next room, turned
down a chair with the back slanting
to the floor, placed a pillow on it and
lay down with his head on the pillow.
He stretched himself out, his feet
crossed, placed his left arm across
his breast, and putting a pistol to his
right temple with his right hand, shot
himself through the head.
Hearing the report of the gun, Mrs.
Walace and his brother rushed into
the room and found him as just de
scribed, except that his right arm had
fallen to his side and the pistol rest
ed between that and his body. He
had expired instantly.
Mr. Wallace was in good financial
circumstances, owning a fine farm
well stocked and had money in the
bank. He left no note or anything
to indicate why he took his own life,
and it can only be surmised that he
was mentally unbalanced at the time,
for, as stated above, his mind for
some years had times been a little
off.
He leaves a wife and one daugh
ter. Mrs. Homer Presnell, to mourn
his sad death. He was a member of
the Christian Church, and Rev. J. M.
Bailey of Farmington conducted the
religious service at his funeral, which
took place yesterday afternoon, and
his body was laid "at rest" with Ma
sonic rites in the Libertyville ceme
tery. The Times joins the many friends
of. the family in sincere sympathy for
them in this great sorrow that has
come into their lives.

The regular fortnightly meeting of
the Farmington Literary Society oc
curs to-night (Friday), and the meet
ing has been turned over to the Farm
ington's Young People's Orchestra,
under direction of Wm. Gower. The
orchestra will give the entire pro
gram, consisting of music, more mu
sic, and then some all of it good.
A good many people who formerly
attended the meetings of the society,
when an orchestra was a regular fea
ture of nearly every program, have
fallen into the habit of staying away.
It is hoped that all those folks will
be in the audience tonight and bring
other music-loving friends with them,
This is the first time the Farmington
Young People's Orchestra has ap
peared in concert, but their playing
deserves the compliment of a "full
house" especially when the enter
tainment is entirely free, as all of
the programs of the Farmington Lit
erary Society are and have been. The
concert begins promptly at 8 o'clock,
and the following is the program to be

ING PLANT
A Times reporter this week nosed
out another manufacturing plant, of
which this commmuty should reel
nroud. The trail was not a cold one,
! however, as we had been informed,
after a recent write-up of Lang Bros.
Mfg. Co., that there was another wa
gon factory in this city.
On Monday afternoon the report
er presented himself to the workshop
of Isenman & Co., builders of wagons,
nlows. etc. We were heartily receiv
ed by Sam Isenman, the only member
of the firm present, who graciously
conducted us through the plant, point
ing out many things of interest, and
explaining many things in regard to
the plant and business that were of
much interest to the scribe.
In passing through the many clus
ters of buildings, splendid squipment
was everywhere seen for the manufac
ture of the very best possible pro
ducts. There was hickory in abun
dance, of which the wagon frame is
very largely constructed, that has
been in the drying sheds for the past
three years. No kind of wood is per
mitted to go through the finishing
rooms until the last particle of sap
has disappeared and the seasoning
process is thorough.
A verv unusual thing in regard to
the Isenman & Co. factory is that ev-
crv department is under the personal
supervision of a member of the firm.
which enables them to keep up the
quality of their product to the highest
possible efficiency. This has resulted
in the reputation of the Isenman Wa
irone being held up to the highest pos.
sible standard. The founder of this
factory, John Isenman, and his two
sons, Sam and Joe, compose the firm,
Will Arcadia Get the
Merged
The Fredericktown Democrat-News
says the following letter has been re
ceived by a number of people of that
city. The suggestion contained there
in, and which seems to be a surprise
to our Fredericktown friends, was
published in the Farmington Times on
December 17, 1915, just after the
Joint Commission, created by the An
nual Conferences of the two Methodist
Conferences, under whose auspices
Carleton College at Farmington and
Marvin College at Fredericktown arc
conducted, met in St. Louis that week.
We then called attention to the fact
that if the idea of the Commission
was carried out both Farmington and
Fredericktown might lose those
schools Here is the letter sent out
by the committee appointed to repre
sent the Joint Commission, which
seems to have cart-blanche to do as
it pleases:
January 7, 1916.
Dear Sir:
At a meeting of the Joint Com
mission on the union of Marvin
and Carleton Colleges, held De
cember 21, 1915, the following res
olution was unanimously adopt
ed: Resolved, that if by the sale of
either College property, or other
wise, funds can be secured to pay
all debts on both institutions and
equip the remaining plant as rec
ommended by the report of
Messrs. Fristoe and Matthews, or
to the satisfaction of this body.
OR, IF BY THE SALE OF
BOTH PLANTS ALL DEBTS
CAN BE PAID, AND A NEW
PLANT BE EQUIPPED ON AR
CADIA ASSEMBLY GROUNDS
OR ELSEWHERE; THAT WE
APPROVE SUCH ACTION AND
THE UNION OF THE TWO
SCHOOLS, ON THE BASIS AL
READY PROVIDED BY THIS
COMMISSION.
A committee, Mr. L. Boeger,
Mr. Hanford Crawford, Rev. H.
P. Crowe and Rev. B. F. Criss
man, was appointed to repersent
the Joint Commission under the
above resolution; and the com
mittee directed the undersigned
to notify an agreed list of friends
in Fredericktown and in Farming
ton of this action.
As soon after January 15, 1916,
as practicable, and at the call of
Dr. Crowe, this committee will
visit Farmington and Frederick
town, to ascertain the wishes of
these communities regarding the
two colleges in question.
Respectfully,
HANFORD CRAWFORD.
Chairman.

IN FARMINGTON
1 while associated with them, in the
blacksmithing department, are Messrs.
Hermann & Herbst. John Isenman
was one of the founders of this bus
iness about forty years ago, and it has
been in continuous operation ever
since. For the past thirty years the
membership of the firm has been as
it is now constituted.
That it is impossible to construct
a better farm wagon than those turn
ed out by Isenman & Co., has long
been known throughout this country,
which fact is demonstrated by the
large number of them that have for
many years been in use throughout
St. Francois and adjacent counties.
This company makes no effort to se
cure car load shipments, but is con
tent to supply the local trade, ihey
averare about six wagons a month, all
of which find a ready market, at a lit
tle high- price than other wagons.
The time of this factory, however,
is not entirely given up to the manu
facture of wagons. They have estnb
lished a trade for a plow of their own
make. They also deal extensively in
farm machinery and repairs. Their
repair department is given careful at
tention, and it is a branch in which
thev are particularly adept. While
there the writer saw an automobile
wheel they had just rebuilt, and it
appeared to be better and more dur
able than it had been originally. We
also saw a silage cart of their own
make, with which they have recently
been supplying an ever increasing de
mand.
Many life-time users of the Isenman
wagons would not know how to get
along without them. They fill a most
apparent need.

Methodist College?
terviewed a number of prominent men
and friends of the school at that place
relative to the action of the commit
tee, and without exception they brand
the action as "childish and absurd."
But the Commission, it seems, has
the authority and power to do this
very thing if the properties of the
two schools can be disposed of as
suggested. The Democrat-News says
"that the people whose money has
been poured into the coffers of the
two schools for the past many years
are entitled to a knowledge of what is
going on," and it says that "one man
who has put a great deal of money in
to the plant at Fredericktown remark
ed that a business man would never
dream of selling the Marvin plant for
anvthing near what it cost." The
same may be said of the Carleton
plant here.
And yet, the suggestion of an en
tircly new location for the consoli
dated colleges, if it should be con
summated, contained in the commis
sion's unanimously adopted resolu
tions, gives the people of both towns
something to think about, and as we
remarked in our issue of December
17th, it behooves them to "get busy.'

General Robt. E. Lee's birthday an

D. C. all over the land made it a day
of observation. Owing to the fact
that so many teachers are members
of the local organization, it was decid
ed to hold the reception Saturday af
ternoon with Mrs. 0. J. Mayberry.
Mrs. Scrutchfield, Mrs. Alma Rider
and Mrs. Mayberry formed the re
ceiving line, and welcomed the num
erous guests from 3 to 5 o'clock.
During the evening an interesting
program was presented. Mrs.
Scrutchfield, the president, made a
little talk. Eilzabeth Gruner gave a
reading, Mrs. Duggins a violin solo,
Mrs. Samuel Tetlev a paper concern
int? the life of Gen. Lee. and Miss
Cunningham sang two Southern mel
odies and the guests joined in the
chorus with a will.
Refreshments were served in the
dining room, Mrs. Marbury and Mrs.

THE LEAD BELT VS.
Brief Explanation
Contrasting the Methods of Working
These Two Great Mineral Fields
There arc two ways to run a
mining district. They are strik
ingly exemplified in Southeast
Missouri and Southwest Missouri,
respectively.
In Southeast Missouri the great
lead mines are owned by so few
corporations that you can count
them on the fingers of one hand.
Nobody knows how many inde
pendent operators there are in
Southwest Missouri; but their
name is legion. Southeast Mis
souri is a rich man's district;
Southwest Missouri is a poor
man's district. Yet it is South
west Missouri that shows us
thriving cities, a net work of in
tcrurban railroads, ' good roads
Mhiili nrA t.hp admiration of the
njation, schools worths of the old
States of the Atlantic seaboard.
It is Southwest Missouri that has
a "mining camp" of 40,000 to 60
000 people, with a million dollar
hotel, stately churches, dozens of
miles of pavements, five and seven
story commercial buildings and
certain elm-lined residence streets
that reminded at least one recent
visitor of portions of Spring
field, Mass.
These things have come out of
the "poor man's camp." But the
best camp in Southeast Missouri
is still struggling to exercise its
right to form a municipal cor
poration, that it may install ma
terworks, lay sewers and operate
its own lights!
We do not mean to imply that
Southeast Missouri could have
produced another Joplin district.
Its disseminated lead deposits re
quire the use of large masses of
capital for profitable production,
while in Southwest Missouri many
a poor ft.low has started a mine
on a Capital of a second-hand
pick and shovel and a few dollars'
worth of provisions bought on
credit, and taken out shallow lead
enough the first week to carry
him on until he struck the "jack"
zinc blend which was the ob
ject of his search. But we do as
sert that Southwest Missouri has
grown in wealth as only a dis
trict can that makes opportunity
universal, and this for other rea
sons than the simple fact that the
region is almost universally min
eralized, with many rich and shal
low deposits.
The Joplin district has had
wealthy men for more than a
quarter of a century who could
have converted it into a district
of wageworkcrs had they been
so inclined. But these men would
not have felt at home in such a
district. They would not have
felt that it was "fair to the rest
of the boys." The Joplin of thir
ty years ago was a frontier com
munity, with a frontier communi
ty's rude vices and glaring de
fects. Its leaders had the defects
of their qualities but their most
jaundiced critic must admit that
they believed in equality of hu
man opportunity, recognized the
fact that, in mining, at least, in
1i,slrv nftnn traps unrewarded.
and took a keen pleasure in keep
ing open to their old associates
and the young men of the "dee
strick" the same road to success
that their own feet had trodden.
The thriving cities and prosper
ous villages of the region today,
with the most democratic society
in the United States, are monu
ments to the instinctive way in
which these men of an older gen
eration held to the idea of equal
ity of opportunity as fundamen
tal to community and social wel
fare. The recent intensive develop
ment of the zinc industry in
Southwest. Missouri is an indus
trial story of absorbing interest.
But in looking at that thriving
region the outside observer ought
to take first things first. The Jop
lin district affords a great exam
ple of the profitable production
of zinc; but that fact yields in
importance to the fact that it af
fords a great example of the de
velopment of human society.
The region is self-developed,
self-taught. It invented its own
machinery, originated its own
mining methods and developed its
own leasing system, unhelped by
the technical knowledge and finan
cial experience of other regions.
Its leaders today are chiefly the
sons and daughters of its own
people, and its miners and mill
hands have been born and bred in
the district, without even a
sprinkling of European importa
tions. . , i
A single fact tells the whole
stroy of the direction of devel
opment. Thirty years ago the
schools of Joplin graduated no
students; the boys and girls "just
quit." Today Jasper county sends
more students to the State Uni
versity than any other county in
the State, save one.

St. Louis Republic.
What the Republic says about the
Joplin mineral district and that it of
fers opportunities to the poor man
that the Lead Belt district of St
Francois county does not, is doubtless
true, but then it is a little unfair in
contrasting these two great mineral
districts of Missouri. Condiions are
in every way so different that it is
impossible for the opportunities of
fered energetic men of small or no
means in the Joplin district to obtain
in the Lead Belt
In the former the enterprising
miner with pick and shovel may go
on the rich man's holdings and mine
for a rovaltv. as brawn and a will to
do can there supply the place of cap
ital, and the holders of the rich min
eral lands there can well afford to let
them do this, for it probably brings
to the latter a greater profit than if
they were organized into large em
ploying corporations.
This of course cannot be done in
the disseminated lead lands of South
east Missouri. The lead here is not
only disseminated with lime stone,
but it lies from 200 to 500 feet be
neath the surface. To sink a single
shaft to reach this disseminated ore
costs from $15,000 to $20,000, then
the rock must be blasted, hoisted to
the surface "with eipensive hoisting
apparatus, and " mills which cost up
into the millions have to be built to
crush the rock and separate the ore.
There is no conceiveable way in
which a miner of small means could
do this independently. It would take
a multimillionaire to work any one of
the big mines in this county on his
own initiative, hence corporatons are
formed, stock sold and the money
raised to start and operate a mine in
the disseminated lead district.
That miners working on their own
responsibility in a mineral district
where the products are so easily and
inexpensively got at as they are in
the Joplin districts are more fortunate
than those who work for corpora
tions on a wage scale, must be con
ceded. If they are thrifty and look
ahead, as many of them are and do,
thev can build and improve their
homes and become permanent and sub
stantial citizens, rear their tamuies
under the most favorable circumstanc
es and help to elevate the community
socially, intellectually and otherwise.
Conditions might be bettered in the
Lead Belt by the companies selling
surface-right lots instead of leasing
them and this we believe some of
them are doing or contemplate doing
so that miners with families who
are thrifty enough may build up and.
own a home of their own. It would
encourage the wage earners and give
them something to work and save for.
As to incorporating the towns in
the Lead Belt, we agree with the
Republic that this ought to be done,
for the sanitary conditions cannot be
much improved unless this is done,
and it would also conduce to better
order and law enforcement. But as
to schools, we doubt that the Joplin
district, with all of its natural ad
vantages to encourage private enter
prise and thrift, is much if any ahead
of the Lead Belt district. Flat River,
Desloge and Bonne Terre have splen
did public schools and each has a
High School affiliating with the State
University. Elvins expects this year
to have its High School and Lead
wood has a two-year course of High
School training. These High School
buildings are beautiful structures and
modern in every respect. We have
not mentioned the Farmington High
School, one of the best and most up-to-date
schools in the State, as Farm
ington, though the county seat -of St.
Francois county, is not properly in
the Lead Belt district.
