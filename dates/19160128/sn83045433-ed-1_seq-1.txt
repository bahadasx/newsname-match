PREPARED SPEECH ABANDONED
President Has Busy Day in New York.
Addresses Railway Men and
Movie Board.
New York, Jan. 27.? Preaident Wllaon
tonight launched forth upon his nation
wide campaign for preparedness. Hii
first speech to the business men of Amer
ica waa made at the seventh annual din
ner of the Railway Buainesa Association
at tho Waldorf-Astoria.
Twelve hundred and fifty men heard
that opening speech. They represented
the greatest railroads tn the East and
the largest railroad supply cities. When
the President had finished, he was es
corted to the Blllmore Hotel, where he
addressed the Motion Picture Board of
Trade. His escort was the Ninth Regi
ment Coaat Artillery. N. G. ?. ?. ?
Every reference the President made toi
national defense was warmly applauded, j
Once and only once, at the dinner at ?
the Waldorf, he referred to hia Mexican!
policy. The 1,250 men who had howled I
their apprpval of an adequate national ?
defense, sat quiet. The President said j
that there wuuld not be Intervention In'
Mexico because pt the example auch an
action would set. Such was the silence
that greeted this remark that the Presi
dent shifted swiftly and thereafter es
chewed the apparently unpopular topic.

For some reason the President ig
nored, the speech he had prepared for
Th? occasion. He as*? wtth tit* ges

way. Virtually every reference he
made to national defense was temper
ed with modifications. Mrs. Wilson
occupied a box and was cheered when
th?? entered.
Once the President declared that
one year ago he didn't believe in a
tariff board. Before he was able to
say that he now saw virtue in such
a body, the rait road men burst into a
roar of approval. But. on the con
trary, when the President declared
that h?? would rather surrender terri
tory than high ideals, there was a 1
mere scattering of applause.
Aa for the navy he declared that
needed no preaching. The navy, he
said, was so obviously a necessary
branch of defense that Its expansion
would require but little urging. He
declared he did not fear for the naval
program. His fears, he Intimated,

TELLS GERMAN
INVASION PLAN
Army Head Rev-eals Scheme
for Attack on United
States.
TO SEIZE EASTERN PART,
CAPTURING MUNITION PLANTS
Tells ?Senate Committee a Naval Force
Could Disable Panama Canal
Locks in Ten Minutes.
Aa an illustration of what a hostil?
power might do tn attacking the United
States. Col. E. F. Glenn. Chief of Staff
of the Eastern Department, described be
fore the Senate Military Affair? Commit
tee yeeterday plans that have been act
ually prepared by Germany.
Th?see plans call for the eelfrare of what
is known as the vital area, the portion
of the L'nited States east of a Une from
I-ake gr-le to Chesapeake Bay, within
which are 90 per cent of the munitions
factories upon which the country would
depend In time of war.
Col. Glenn said that he had been In
formed by a German officer that the
German staff did not count upon occu
pying ?any other portion of the United
States in case of hostlltles. The seurure
of the vital area would give It a strangle
hold upon the entire country.
fol. Glenn added, hoirever, that a for
eitc? power might establish a base at
Key West, which would enable It to ?hut
off the commerce of the Mississippi Val
ley passing through the Gulf of Mexico.
The ease with which a first-class power
might effect a landing. In case of the
failure of the navy, was emphasised by
Col. Glenn by the statement that on the
eastern shore of the United States there
are 116 landing places between Boston
harbor and the Chesapeake.
"I do not mean to say," he added,
"that we are ln any more danger of
attack from Germany than from any
other European power."
Much the same situation prevails on
the Pacific coast, he said, where an In
vading army could seise the Fuget Sound
area and hold it against the remainder
of the country by controlling the passes
I through which the railroad trunk lines
pass.
"We are,'' continued Col. Glenn, "In a
devlHshly dangerous predicament and I
appeal to you to rise above the common
clamor of the ignorant and the pacifist.
Your duty ls plain and simple "
Senator Fletcher, a member of the
committee, called attention to a state
ment by Senator La Follette that at a
meeting of several thousand persons in
the Middle West not one voice was raised
In approval of the administration's pre
paredness plans.
"That is due to ignorance, I believe,"
said Col. Glenn. "Sentiment east of the
Alleghenles, I think. Is practically unan
imous In favor of universal military train
ing."
Col. Glenn, in support of the proposal
for the establishment of a national coun
cil of defense, call**d attention to the
necessity for careful study of the Panama
Canal defenses. As the defenses are now
constituted, he explained, it would be
possible for a naval force to approach
near enough to the canal locks to dis
able them ln ten minutes with a six-Inch
gun.
He also advocated a better Information
servi????. "Call them spies or whatever
you like," he said, "we need more mili
tary experts in foreign countries. All of
our own plans and resources are known.
I venture to say that the plans worked
out by our General Staff are better
known to foreign governments than they
are to the General Staff itself."

TTie Teuton agents planted the dicto

"TV'lth the aid of an expert mechan

"The scheme perhaps would have work

anticipated this method of attack. Ac

management to make a thorough .^earch

twice a week. Because of this, the dic

guaro* at the White House, shot and killed
himself in his home at 1422 Thirty-fifth

fore he was to report for duty at the
.Executive Mansion.
Pierce shot himself wtth his service
revolver, a .32 caliber. piacing the
muzxle in his mouth. Death was In
stantaneous. Ill health was given as the
probable cause of his act.
Pierce, a policeman for twenty-threu
years, had be*n a guard at the White
House for twelve yeara. He was tran?*
ferred there after he had been injured
while stopping a runaway as a mounted
policeman. Partial paralysis of one foot
developed from the injury, and, although
he never appeared to be brooding, it la
supposed he feared flnal consequences of
the disorder.
During his sen-fee at the Executive
?Mansion under three Presidents, Piercu
intercepted many would-be callers at the
grounds. He was stationed at th?1 east
entrance to the grounds, one of the
most important posts of the White House
guarda It is said he was a descendant
of a- prominent .Maryland family of the
same name.
Pierce arose about 10 o'clock last night,
partially dressed himself and went down
stairs. His wife heard him from the
dining room. He returned to his bed- j
room wfth his revolver and a few
minutes later his wife heard a shot. She
found him lying on the bed He died
almost instantly from the shot through
his head. He was to have gone to the
