Although official • confirmation
is lacking, it was learned
luesday from reliable sources that F

senior engineers of the United States
reclamation service and supervising
engineer of the big government pro
Bolse . is to succeed Sydney R.

recommendation of A. F. Davis, di
rector of the reclamation service, who

ing a comprehensive survey of the
work of the service. The announce

his duties require him to be on the
road the greater part of the time.

HORSE AND MULE BUSINESS
HAS BECOME GREATEST IN
THIS SECTION OF THE
COUNTRY
Inspectors of Various Governments
Now Com« Here Regularly—
Farmers Dispose of Surplus Hay
Preparations ar e Under Way For
the Big February Sale.
The business of the Union Stock
Vards, run by the Caldwell Horse &
îw c ' Under th e direction of J.
W. Smeed, has grown to be one of
the most important not only of Cald
well but of this section of the coun
try.
In 1915 the company sold 25,000
horses and mules and proved Cald
well to be the logical center of the
greatest horse and mule market of the
-Northwest. These sales amounted to
more than three million dollars, the
la-ger part of which went to the
hcisc growers of contiguous territory
- nice August the yards 1 ave bought
and paid for more than $35,000.00
worth, of alfalfa, always paying the
highest market price.
This great industry deserves the
warmest support from everybody in
this section. They have not only
brought the horse market to the door
of the farmer and grower, where the
best prices are obtainable, but they
have attracted the inspectors of the
various governments of the world
that are looking for horses. If the
prices offered at the sale do not prove
satisfactory, the seller may wait for
the government inspections that are
being made constantly and obtain bet
ter prices.
The farmer has probably benefitted
more than any one person by the sue
cess of the sales. His hay has been in
constant demand at the very best
prices and he has been enabled to dis
pose of his surplus stock at best
horse market prices. As the sales
grow in importance this value to the
fa ™ ,e r will be more marked.
The sale to begin next Tuesday pro
mises to be one of the best. The
management expects a"bout 1500 head
to be offered for sale with prices verv
satisfactory.

UNITED STATES ARMY
OFFICERS VISIT MILITIA CO.
Considerable enthusiasm was made
manifest among the members of Com
pany G the local militia company, at
the drill Monday evening. Adjutant
general Crow and Lieutenant Garber,
L. S. A., made their appearance and
expressed themselves as well pleased
at the splendid spirit of the com
pany.
Lt. Garber addressed the men, ex
plaining the contest recently inau
gurated among the companies of the
state to secure additional enlistments.
Squad leaders were selected and judg
ing from the way in which the men
started to work, Company G will soon
be recruited to war strength. Addi
tional prizes arc being offered by the
business men of the city.
1 here appears to be a good pros
pect for Congress to pass a Militia
I ay Bill at this session, making the
State Militia part of the first line of
defense. The various commercial
bodies of the country are passing re
solutions asking that be done by
Congress and it is doubtful if that
body can withstand the influence be
ing brought to bear, notwithstanding
•he peanut-politician opposition.
The United States Army officers
have been forced to acknowledge the
efficiency of the State Militia—an ef
ficiency that will no doubt be increas
ed under the provisions of the pro
posed legislation.
Local militiamen will in all prob
ability receive about $4.00 per month
for regular service—about one dollar
for each drill. This will tend to en
courage greater diligence and a some
what more strict attention to the de
tails of the service.
The discipline and general training
gained during the term of enlistment
is of distinct advantage and the en.
thusiasm of the local company makes
membership a thing to be desired.
W. W. Kimple the fore part of the
week returned from Portland, where
he had taken a shipment of cattle,
le sold his stuff for a very good price
all things considered. Mr. Kimple
found bad weather all along the line.
He was at Portland during the heavy
snow and extreme cold weather. At
matilla it was 18 degrees below zero
when Mr. Kimple was there.

Caldwell Public Building Bill is In

Caldwell with her excellent educa
tional facilities; highly productive ter
ritory; superior transportation and
marketing conditions and intelligent
and progressive citizenship is destined
to be one of the leading communities
I ot the great northwest in the opinion
ot Dr. F. M. Cole.
"Caldwell and the Caldwell coun
try lias a glorious future," Dr. Cole de
clared, "and those of us who are fa
miliar with the undeveloped resour
ces of tlie country and the opportuni
ties offered the serious minded men
are contident that ere manv years
elapse our community will rank fore
post in productiveness and stability
in the entire west.
Caldwell has gained renown
throughout the country as an ideal
home city and not without just cause,'
he continued. "To parents desiring to
rear their children in congenial and
inspiring environment Caldwell has a
direct appeal. Our educational sys
tem is complete; the spiritual life of
the city finds expression through
churches representing practically
every denomination and our splendid
Chautauqua and lyceum brings to us
yearly the messages of the world
greatest thinkers.
"The rapid increase in the enroll
ment of the Caldwell public schools
and of the College of Idaho reflect
■the importance of the city as an edu
cational center. The total enrollment
of the public schools is the largest in
the history of the city, numbering, I
am told, more than a thousand pupils.
The curriculum is practical and grad
uates have a solid foundation for
collegiate course.
With a faculty that is recognized
by educators the country over for its
ability and with equipment commen
surate with its needs the College of
Idaho completes the educational chain.
The college is the only institution of
higher learning within a radius of
several hundred miles and its substan
tial growth amply demonstrates that
its worth is recognized throughout
this section," concluded Dr. Col
Club Notes.
I he club has received copies of the
bill introduced by Congressman Smith
providing for an appropriation for a
public building at Caldwell. The bill
follows:
"Be it enacted by the Senate and
the House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress
assembled, that the Secretary of the
Treasury be, and he is hereby authori
zed and directed to provide for the
erection and completion, upon a site
heretofore authorized, a suitable build

and ventilating apparatus, approaches,
and all other neccssarw fixtures and'
appurtenances, for theu se and ac
comodation of the United States post
office and other government offices at
Caldwell, Idaho, the cost of the said
site and building not to exceed $100,
000.00, which sum is hereby appropri
ated out of any money in tile treasury
not otherwise apportioned." The bill
was introduced January 4.
The board of directors of the Boise
Water Users' association met in the

J. B. Gowen. secretary of the Idaho

departments in the state, declared the
affable secretary.
The club committee on the Idaho
State Fair at a meeting held last
week decided to again assume charge
of the amusement features at the
grounds and in the down town dis
trict. The complete success of the
venture last year demonstrated that
with proper effort the revenues from
the down town concessions will more
than cover the cost of producing a
high class amusement program at
the grounds. The committee mem
bers were all enthusiastic regarding
prospects for the coming fair. Those
