Liberty Greater?
New York, Jan 28?President
Wilson last night opened his personal
appeal to the country for national
defense. He gave- warning that plans
for the readjustment of the army
must be formulated and carried on
without delay and declared solemnly
he could not predict that the outlook
for the United States would be as
bright tomorrow as today.

trade, he sounded the keynote of ad
dresses that he will deliver during
the next ten days in the middle west.
In Fighting Mjpod.
Mr Wilson was in a lighting mood
through his address. In a speech
delivered early in the day he de
clared he always accepted an invita
tion to fight Last night he told the
railway men he was an advocate of
peace and had struggled- to keep the
United States at peace/but he con
sidered the liberty and honor of the
nation even more important than
peace
"Woe to any man who plays
marplot or seeks to make party poli
tics or personal ambition take pre
cedence over candor, honor and un
selfish, unpartisan service," the
president declared in speaking of his
defense plan before the railway men
Country Expects Action.
He declared the country expects
action this is a year cf accounting,
and the accounting must be definite
on the part of every individual who
wishes to enjoy th pufelse ranfidenee.
"For my part I hope every man in
public life will get what's coming to
him," Mr. Wilson said amid laughter
and applause.
The president admitted that in a
message to the last congress he had
said the need for preparedness was
not pressing. He declared he had
learned differently in the meantime.
He cited his recent support of a tar
iff commission as another instance of
a change on his part, but said that
previously there was no need for
such a commission.
Discussed Mexican Policy.
The president discussed his Mexi
can policy vigorously. He asserted
that to invade Mexico would mean
the losing of confidence of the rest
of the western hemisphere. He cited
the freeing of Cuba as an instance
of good done by the United States.
