LYCEUM COURSE
Commercial Club Contracts
With Redpath Bureau and
will Furnish Five Fine En
tertainment Features.
Through the action taken Mon
day by the Commercial club in
closing a contract with Mrs. Day,
of the Redpath Lyceum Bureau,
the citizens of Cottonwood and
vicinity are assured of the oppor
tunity of enjoying some of the
finest entertainment features
next fall and winter that have
ever been brought to Camas prai
rie. The course will consist of
five numbers, which will include
Nels Darling, the famous lect
urer; Scheldkrets' Hungarian or
chestra; the American male quar
tette; the Fairchild female quar
tette, and J. Adam Bede, lecturer.
The first number will appear here
sometime in October or Novem
ber and the others in January,
February and March.
The best talent in the United
States is under contract with the
Redpath bureau for lyceum and
Chautauqua work and any num
bers that are secured from that
bureau are guaranteed to be high
class in every respect. It cost
the Commercial club almost $500
to secure the five numbers above
named and to defray these ex
penses season tickets will be
placed on sale at an early date at
$2.50 each, or 50 cents a seat for
each number on the lyceum pro
gram. Single admissions will be
placed at a higher sum so it will
pay all who enjoy fine music and
lectures to secure their season
tickets and attend every number.
In contracting for the above
attractions the commercial club
did so with a view of providing a
better class of entertainment for
the residents of the west side of
the county than can u ually le
had here. Few of our people
have an opportunity of going to
the larger cities each year and,
as a consequence, have to content
themselves with the poor or in
different amusement features
that visit the smaller towns.
Since it is almost impossible for
our people to go where the better
attractions are, the club decided
to bring some of these attractions
here and the signing of the con
tract with the Redpath company
was the result. It is to be hoped
that the public will appreciate
the efforts of the club in this
matter and will show their ap
preciation in a substantial man
ner and attend every number in
the course.
If the present attempt proves
a success the club will undoubt
edly contract for another course
for the winter of 1917-18 and will
bring in numbers such as usually
are not seen outside of cities
such as Spokane and Portland.
Wm. Courter Weds
Cards have been received an
nouncing the marriage at Pendle
ton, Ore., December 20, 1915, of
Miss Mabel Llewellyn to William
Courter. The bride is well known
in this city. Following her grad
uation from the Lewiston Busi
ness college she was employed
as bookkeeper with several firms
of the city. Mr. Courter is local
agent at Pendleton for the Kerr
Gifford grain company, says the
Sunday Lewiston Tribune.
The above must refer to our
old friend Courter, of Ferdinand,
who is well known and has many
friends in this section. Unless
vfre are greatly mistaken the bride
is the daughter of E. E. Llew
ellyn, of Ferdinand, and former
ly resided at Steunenberg for
several years. Congratulations
and felicitations.
Can Leave Homesteads
Temporary absence from a
homestead is not abandonment.
This is the ruling laid down by
the supreme court in placing a
construction on sections 4552
4555. The issue came up in the
case of W. R. and Maude E.
Goldensmith vs. the Snowstorm
Mining company, on appeal from
the First judicial district for Sho
shone county. The Snowstorm
Mining company was in posses
sion of certain lands the Golden
smiths had occupied as a home
stead. They brought suit against
the mining company to quiet title
to the property in them, claiming
they had but left the property
but temporarily. The Snowstorm
Mining company contended they
had abandoned the homestead
for a period of five years. It
sjems the Goldensmiths were
pc o ' and had to leave the home
stead for long periods in order to
support themselves. The supreme
cou*t he 11 that they had the right
to do this and still retain title to
hs property. The opinion is
unanimous. It was written by
Justice Alfred Budge. Judgment
given by the lower court for the
plaintiff is affirmed.
Little One Victim
Of Pneumonia
Etta, the little two-year old
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. C. E.
Fredericks, died at their home in
this city early Sunday morning
from bronchial pneumonia after
an illness of only a couple of days
and was buried Monday morning,
the funeral being held from the
Nau undertaking parlors. The
death of the little one was quite
sudden, as she and her little sis
ter were taken ill only a couple
of days before, and at the time
of little Etta's death the other
child lay at death's door but has
since passed the crucial stage
and is on the road to recovery
Mrs. Fredericks was not at home
at the time, she having been un
der the care of a nurse for the
past several weeks, and did not
know of the illness of her little
one until death had claimed it.
The sorrowing parents have the
sympathy of many friends in
their bereavement.
a
New Highway Board Sworn In
After being held up from tak
ing office for the past several
weeks on account of the illness
of two of its members, the newly
elected board of commissioners
of the Cottonwood Highway Dis
trict met in this city Monday,
were sworn into office and pro
ceeded to organize by electing
August Schroeder as chairman of
the board and J. F. Jenny as
secretary and treasurer. No
other business was transacted
aside from looking over the books
and getting familiar with the
financial affairs of the district.
However, in the near future the
board will no doubt select road
overseers for the various subdivi
sions of the district and get mat
ters lined up to do some good
road work as soon as the weather
will permit in the spring.
Mr. and Mrs. Fred Rustemeyer
left yesterday morning for Spo
kane where the lady will undergo
an operation at the Sacred Heart
hospital.
The "Silent Nine" gave an
other of their delightful lunch
eons Monday afternoon, Mrs. G.
F. McKinney being hostess,
delicious luncheon was served at
one o'clock after which the re
mainder of the afternoon was
spent with cards, Mrs. H. J.
Smith carrying off the honors.

County Assist on Bridge
Jack Wills and E. B. Meeker
came up from Kooskia this week
and appeared before the board in
advocacy of a county appropria
tion to assist the people down
there in the re-construction of
the bridge across the Clearwater
which has been condemned and
apt to go out with the high waters
of spring. The bridge will cost
considerable over $2000 and the
burden of building the same is
such that the community could
not assume it entirely. After
considering the matter the board
agreed to assume a third of the
cost of construction and thus
lighten the burden some upon
the people down there who are
carrying about all the tax they
can.—Free Press.
