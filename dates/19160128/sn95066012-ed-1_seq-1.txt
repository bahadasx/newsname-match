"PEACE AND WAR."
Free Lecture at High School Hall on
Evening of Feb. 9.
7-uid War is the subject to be
discusstu. "''r the auspices of Uen
nington Counv..of the Knights of Co
lumbus at High School hall on Wed
nesday evening, February 9 by the
well known orator, debater and au
thor, David Goldstein of Doslon. The
supreme oilicers of the Knights of Co
lumbus, who are conducting a nation
wide lecture movement in defense of
Christian principles against the Insi
dious propagandas of the enemies of
God aud country, have assigned Mr.
Goldstein for a lecture in this city.
Great enthusiasm Is manifesting it
uelf among the local knights at the
coming of their brother knight, who is
making his third annual tour for the
orde.
In reporting his Chautauqua worl;
of last summer the Pontiac (111.) Dai
ly Leader says: "The address of
David Goldstein of Boston, secretary
liostou school of political economy,
attracted wide attention at the first
Sunday meeting of the Chautauqua
yesterday.
"Mr. Goldstein is. an interesting
speaker, Rifted with a keen, penetrat
ing intellect, a marvelous flow of lan
guage, and a trenchant, almost cold
blooded way of driving fact after fact
right home to his hearers. He does
not mince words, and every sentence
he utters is given iu,a way that al
most forces assent."
Mr. Goldstein was formerly a fore
most leader in the socialist movement
having been the first candidate of the
socialist party for mayor of his home
city, Boston. He is said to have re
rigned frcm the socialist movement
12 years ago alter a futile attempt to
get the organization to repudiate ils
immoral teachings. His reasons are
outlined in a book called "Socialism,
tho Nation of Fatherless Children,"
which has a circulation of over 40,000
copies. It is highly recommended by
Cardinal O'Ctmnell. Col. Roosevelt,
Samuel Gonipers and other distin
guished opponents 01 socialism the
country over.
The committee of Bennington Coun
fit of the Knights of Columbus an
nounces that Mr. Goldstein will glad
ly answer all questions related to l'.in
subject Peace and War at the ct n
clualcn of his address. This feature
of the speaker's work adds zest to !!'..
occasion, for Mr. Goldstein is said to
bo a past master iu meeting friend
and foe face to face with a courteous
but decisive defense of his convic
tions. The press near and far have
a like story to tell. The Providence
Journal says: "Thi3 readiness with
which Mr. Goldstein handled the quer
ies which were buried at him. some
times two and three at a time, indi
cated his thorough knowledge of his
subject, and his ability to discuss it at
ail angle.
Speaking of Mr. Goldstein's work in
San Francisco, The Monitor says:
"There were 5,000 people in Dream
land Pavilion last night. That 'im
mense auditorium and its spacious
galleries was packed to the doors.
Hundreds were obliged to stand;
many were turned away. The sea of
humanity that greeted Mho speaker I
when he stepped forth must have I
been nn Inspiring sight to him. To a
loss courageous man the' knowledge
that hundreds of ills sworn enemies,
the 'Reds, were also gathered there,
come to defy him and cry him down,
might have born disconcerting to say
the least. .But to Goldstein, 'the more
the merrier.' There never was'aj
crowd of Socialists hlg enough yet to
do anything but sharpen his wit the
keener and reinforce his daring ili
tho more.
notii ojour sum ojinaoj R.uiaispioo
a lecture. It was a spectacle and a
debate one man against hundreds.
The air was surcharged with the
electricity of tho conflict. The dra
matic, suspense was keener than in
tho mcst breathless play. To see
that little Napoleon of the platform
marshaling his forces facts, facts,
farts' against the guerrilla warfare
of his enemies, and mercilessly mow
ing them down till they were flattened
like a rwheatfleld after a cyclone, was
an intellectual treat and a sports
man's joy."
The meeting will be held in High
school hall at 8 o'clock p. m. sharp.
Admission will be free to all.

Louden, .Ian. 27. U'iih tho transac
tion of the formalities giving slitu
tory force to the military service bill,
the bill prolonging the lite of parlia
ment and the trading with the enemy
bill. I'aMiament was prorogued today
until Feb. 15.
Tho King's speech of prorogation,
which was read by Baron HiicktnasUT
of Cheddi'.igtcn, lord high chancellor.
was probably tho briefest on record
on such an occasion, but his referenc
es to the war were regarded as high
ly Int ortant.
"For eighteen months." lie said,
my navy and army have been engag
ed, in concert with brave and stead
fast aliies, in defending our common
liberties and tho public law of Europe
against unprovoked encroachments by
the enemy. I am sustained by the de
termination of my people at home
and cvfrsoas to carry our l!ag to a
final, decisive victory. In this strug
gle, forced upoa us by these who hold
in lislit esteem the liberties and coven
ants which we regard as sacred, we
shall not lay down our arms until we
have' vindicated the cause whi.-h car
ries with iL the future of civilization.
"I rely with confidence upon the luy
al and united efforts of all my sub
jects, which, have never failed me. and
I pray that Almighty Grd may give
us His blessing."
The king thanked the house of com
mons for the ungrudging liUeralitv
with which it. has provided lor the
heavy demands ot the war.

hell, the retiring master a purse of

Washington, Jan. 27. Secretary
Lansing today made public the note
Kent on Jan. i to Ambassador Pago at
London instructing him to make "for
mal and vigorous" pretest to the Brit
ish government against the seizure of
American mails while in transit to'
neutral stations.
At the same time Mr. lousing gave
cut Sir Edward Greys preliminary
anrwer, which is regarded here as far
from satisfactory. All it states-- is
that the seizure of mail;-, from neutral
er:.-els "raised important questions of
principle in regard to matters -which
are determined by the policy jointly
decided ami acted upon by the allied
Governments," and that Lniland is
therefore compelled to communicate
with her aliies before .she can reply
to tho Fnited States,
In his pretest Secretary Umsing
said that as a result of the Britisli ac
tion strong feeling had been aroused
hi this country on account of loss of
valuable letters, drafts and money
orders, ant! that foreign banks were
refusing t', cash American drafts ow
ing to tho absence of any security
that the drafts 'would travel safely lu
the mails. Mr. Lansing calls . atten
tion to the fact that sealed malls end
American diplomatic and consular
poaches have been dcta-'iied, and that
this is "an aggravating circumstance
i:i a practice which is generally re
garded in this country as vexatious))'

peal to tlio country for national '
tense. . . lie gave warning that plan

Mr. Wilson was in a fighting mood
throughout his addresses. Early iu
the day he declared he always accept
ed an invitation to light. Tonight he
told the railroad men he was an ad
vocate of peace and had struggled to
ecp the United States at peace, but
that he contii'.ered the liberty and
li!uur- of the nation even more impor-
t?nt than peace.
"Wee to any man who plays mar-.

politics or personal ambition take ,
precedence over candor, honor and
unselfish, ur.pnrtLan service," said
the President iu speaking of his de
fense plan before tho railroad men.
The country expects action, he de
I.ued, that this is a year of account-
W. and that the ar.r.oi'.nting must be'

"Fcr my part I hope every man in. ,
public life will get what's coming to

ter and applause, , - :
The President admitted that " in a
message to the last 'congress he had '
said the need for preparedness was -not
pressing. Ho declared he had
learned something in the meantime. .
He cited his recent support of a tariff
commission as'anothor instance of a.
hange oa his part but declared that
