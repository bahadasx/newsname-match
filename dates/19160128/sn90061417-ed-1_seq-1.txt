Illli IIKAIN'AUK SCHEME.
Petition Filed (or Rc-Orjanuatioi
and Extension o( Doundarics
of Squaw Creek.
W. II. Illchards, attorney for A. V.
VanCamp and nluety-tlve others,tllcd
In the oillce of the Clerk of the Cir
cuit Court, a petition, on the '.'Otli
Inst., for the organization of a new
Drainage District to be called S.uaw
Creek Drainage District No. Two.
Till district embraces all of the
lands formerly embraced In the
S'ltuw Creek Drainage No. One, to
gether w ltd over li.noO acres of addi
tional land. The northern boundary
of the district Is the road crossing
the Mound Cty ami Craig road at
right angles at Summit church. The
western and northern boundary of
the district Is the bound.iry line of
the Utile Tarklo Drainage District
ami the Hlg Tarklo Drainage District
and extenil southerly anil westerly
from theru to the Missouri river, run
iltug down through Township Sixty
of Haiige Thirty-nine (Th west of
Forest City on the eat Hue of Sec
tion Seventeen (I7, Twenty (2m and
Twenty nine (it) of Township Sixty
MM) of Hange Thirty-nine (.Ti); thence
eastvvarilly and southerly below Tor'
est City Into Township Klfty-nliie
(.Vi) of llange Thirty-eight CM and
then north to the Turlington rail
road: thence following the Hurling
ton rillrJ.nl north and west through
I'orest City; then eastward to the
county road generally following the
county road northward and westward
to the .Summit church.
This Drainage District on Its east
ern bjundary will be something over
twenty miles In length and contains
an area of 2i M acres. The petition
ers for Incorporation haeln vie the
taking over uf ail of the present
works of the S'iiaw Creek District
No One and so far as any ditch,
drain or lateral constructed by that
district cm tu iitllled It will In ml
llzed hy the new organisation. The)
propose to hire a thoroughly eoinpe
tent engineer to luvu the levels taken
In the whole territory and dltche
and drains o:ated where the engineer
slutl decide the same. No specNI fa
vors will be granted to any one or dl
versions or lines of ditches or laterals
m fie on account of any Individual
but the 1'ian of the engineer will be
strictly followed. The old Sipiaw
Creek ditch, theexcavatlon for which
began In the center of Section Thlr
ty-tlve In ToaushlpSIX'y two lV
of Itingtt Thirty-nine i.'l.i , wilt be
pushed northward about one mile
Into the mouth of the valley of the
S.liavv Creek water-shed so that the
Hoods from that wator-shed will be
Impounded and conilned by proper
dikes and levees so that they will not
escape and Haw out around the ditch
as at present. The new location for
this illlch tonth of lllgelow, as con
temptated. If such new location shall
be found most advisable by the engl
neer Is, that the same shall be divert
ed south and west to the Missouri
river: that the old channel of Davb.
Creek from Mound City southward
as excavated, shall be widened and
deepened and levees of smllclent
height thrown up along this illlch
In Its course southward to Napier
and on through the old Siuaw Creek
ditch to provide ample means for
taking care of the Hoods of the Davis
Creek water-shed provided the pres
ent location meets the approval of
the engineer, If not, then a new loca
tlon for this ditch.
It Is contemplated that a new
ditch shall be cut for the Ivlnsey
Creek water-shed, the location to be
determined by the engineer. The gen
eral course, however, being as now
contemplated, to turn Klnsey Creek
southward and westward at the Ttir
ney bridge along the Mound City and
Oregon county road to an outlet In
the Missouri river. In other words,
that each principal water-shed of
the county, Squaw 'Creek water-shed
Davis Creek water-shsd and Klmsey
Creek water-shed shall have a direct
outlet to the MUsourl river without
being Interfered with hy any Hoed
from any other water-shed.
It Is contemplated that a lateral
drain shall be constructed commenc
Ing at or near the northern boundary
of the district, possibly at the bum
mil church road and extending along
the line approved and found most
practical by the engineer southward
- and eastward to connect with the
Squaw Creek ditch at a point south
of lllgelow. This would be a main
lateral drain and Into this main lit
t eral other laterals of suillclent size to
convey all surface waters to the main
lateral for all the land lying north
and west of Hound City to the north
boundary of the district would be
coutruotM.
It is contemplated that a lateral
drain be constructed from a point just
.south of lllgelow running southward
and along the line to he located by
the engineer to connect with the
Squaw Creek ditch at a point possi
bly west of Napier. It Is also con
templated that a main lateral drain
be constructed from a point Just
south of Mound City and Just east of
the present location of Davis Creek
on the low ground and following the
line to be located hy the engineer
southward for the purpose of taking
care of the surface water that will
How on to the lands from the hills
from the eastward and from the wa
tersheds of the lllalr branch, Swope
branch and from any other minor water-sheds
along the eastern boundary
of the district southward to Napier.
For the lands I) Ing between the Davis
Creek ditch and the Old Squaw Creek
ditch as now located, It Is contem
plated that the minor laterals will be
cut for surface drainage Into the old
channel of the Squaw Creek ditch
running southeast across the valley
from a point Just below lllgelow.
It Is contemplated for the lands ly
ing north of Mound City that proper
lateral and drains will he locatul to
taku c.ire uf the Totter Creek water
shed and of other minor water-sheds
lu that portion of the territory That
provisions will he made to protect all
ot the territory of the proposed dis
trict from the Hoods escaping from
the Mttle T.uklo basin into and over
this territory The manner and mode
of accomplishing this, of course. Is to
be determined by the engineer.
The matter of engineering will be
carefully gone over and considered
before any Plan for Heclama
tlon Is adopted lu Hits matter
It Is contemplated nut to rely
solely upon the recommendation uf
the engineer employed but to call to
tlii assistance of the Hoard of .super
visors other engineers and alsii to sob
mil the matter hi the engineering
department of the Missouri State
I'nlverslty at Columbia so that so far
as It Is possible, before any money Is
expended for digging ditches In the
grouud.they will lie dog theoretically
correct on piper.
rite question has ben asked very
fie'iieiitly. what is all tills going to
cost? 'lids Is the great American
(Joes' Ion The answer to that Is
that at this time, nobody cm tell but
that it Is not soinucha uiatterof what
Itotsaslt s to get the tiling you
want. The body of laud i mbraced in
tills district, If properly drained and
protected from Hoods and oveillow,
would he worth as much In the mar
ket as any land in our county and
would heapproxlinitoly fmir and one
half millions ot dollars and the crop
lu any one year, oil of this body of
land, would pay for all uf the wotk
necessary to protect It.
One of the troubles about drainage
reclamation In this county Is, that
the condition is not bad enough. If
the whole territory was a' swamp and
unhabitable and entirely uuproduc
live, there would lie found many men
In this country with money getting
behind a project to drain and reclaim
It. This Is shown by things that
have been done lu southeast Missouri
and In Arkansas and other southern
stales.
