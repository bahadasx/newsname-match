DEATII
Of Former Neptune Girl by As
phyxiation at Toledo
RcanlU la Arrest of Cha. Cole on
Charge of First Degree Mur-der-Facea
Electric Chair.
M.VHtiry surrounds the death of Ailii
Monoysmlth Vunfleot, a daughter of Mr,
and Mm. Win. Moncysmlth, who reside on
a farm 2 miles cast of Neptune. The
young woman wan found dead In tt room
ing house In Toledo, where she und a
man by the name of Cole hud two rooms
fur Unlit housekeeping. Death was due
to asphyxlutlon.
The man named Colo was overcome hy
the gas fumes but was later revived at
a hospltul. Detectives at Toledo are still
working on the cane, but ax yet nothing
linn developed In regard to ti.e Kli I'h un
fortunate death.
Reports from the Moncysmlth family
indicate the death was accidental, due
to escaping gas in Mrs. Vanfleefs room
In the Toledo rooming houae. Advices
credited to the Toledo Chief of l'olice
Bay that there la no suspicion of murder
or of suicide. St. Marys r e 1 a -tlves
and acquaintances know of no reas
ons for a suicide theory. Mention In
Monday's dispatch concerning a man
named Cole, held In connection with the
death, Is said to lie on error, though It
Is sustained by Toledo press reports pre
ceding this article.
Mrs. Vanfleet was born and raised on
the Aloneysmlth farm in Center township.
She attended school at Neptune where
she graduated. She later attended school
nt St. Marys. She was a popular and ac
complished young girl.
She was mrrled to Lloyd Vanfleet, of
near Koekford, but they had not lived
together for several years. A two year
old daughter who resides with her grand
parents; the parents, Mr. and Mrs. Mon
eysmith and three sisters Mrs. Clarence
Wurster. of Center township: Mrs. Henry
Knarr of Wapakoneta, and Mrs. Chas.
Elierle, of Lima, also survive.
Funeral services were held from the
home of her parents Wednesday after
noon. Interment was made In Kim Grove
cemetery at St. Marys.
What the Toledo Blode has to say re
garding the case:
She was a stripper In a Wapakoneta
tobacco factory. He was one of the la
borers on a paving Job near the factory
In Kapakonetu.
They met without much formality.
Kach had been married. Kach had found
marriage gulling. Kach left children.
They came to Toledo. She was killed by
gas Sunday. Ho was almost overcome.
He is locked up on suspicion. Coroner
Henzler is investigating.
And there you have the story of a man
who savs he is Charles Cole, 28 a team
ster, and of a woman who, Cole says,
was Mrs. Ada Moneysmlth Vanfleet, 23,
of St. Marys.
The tragedy was enacted In a room
ing house conducted by Mrs. Clara Brown
at 442 Eleventh street, where the couple
had two rooms for light housekeeping in
the basement. They were known as Air.
und Mrs. Charles Cole.
Until Tuesday, whew the woman be
came 111 with tonsilitis, she was an as
sembler at the Champion Spark Plug
factory. Cole was a teamster for A.
Kent ley & Sons.
The attention of others was attracted
first to the couple Sunday at 11, when
the woman screamed. Mrs. Geo. Wentz,
daughter of the landlady, ran to then
room and found the pair playfully scuf-
"oh, we've got too high blood pressure"
Cole answered.
About 2 o'clock Mrs. Brown and Mrs.
Wentz smelled gas. They found the two
unconscious and screamed several times
just as Alson lions, father of Mrs. Brown
und his son, William, 1808 Adams street,
drove up. ,
The elder Irons rushed Into the Coles
bed room und found two gas Jets and a
stove turned on and unllghted and the
windows closed. He carried the woman
to an open window. She gasped twice
and died.
The woman had been lying In bed.
Kneeling, with his face In the bed clothes
was Cole. The younger Irons notified the
police.
Detective McCloskey and Motor Patrol
men Kussell and Manley could not get
tt doctor. They took Cole to St. Vin
cent's hospital, where he was revived.
They then took lilm to the coroner, who
ordered him held.
IS CHARGED WITH MURDER
The latest report derived from the in
vestigation into the death of me Vanfleet
girl at Toledo last Sunday is to the ef
fect that a first degree murder charge
has been placed against Charles Cole,
the man found with the dead girl when
the police arrived. A Toledo special of
yesterday "ay-- ,
Charles Cole!, 2g, may die In the el
ectric chair a , result of the asphyx-i
tat ion 4f MrH- Ada VanFleet, 23, last
Sunday, ir ?, was formally charged
with mUTJr the first degree today
by DeteuYe McCloskey, after Cor
oner Henzler rendered a verdict on
the wr" death.
Mrs. Vttn.ieet was known as Mrs.
Cole. FhL'h ivas married and had des
erted theh partners at Wapakoneta
anu had been living together in To
ledo three months, the police say.
"Coroner 'Henzler said Cole was re
sponsible for turning on the gas Jet
and tilling the room wita gas which
caused the woman's death. Cole nar
rowly escaped death In the same
manner."

Was Basket Ball Game Between
Celina and Dayton Cadets, .
Score Favoring Latter.
In what was easily the most thrilling
basket ball game ever played on the local
floor, the far-famed Dayton Cudets de
feated the Mercelinas by the score of 36
to 34. ThTire was not a dull moment in
the entire contest and the ball was on
the move at all times.
Dutch Schulte started things an instant
after the whistle by a field basket and
Munler soon followed with another. The
Daytonltes then got busy and swamped
the locals In the first half by the score
of 24 to 14.
Jn the second half, however, the Mer
celinas started to gain points and soon
were on their opponents heels. The
Cadets, who had hardly expected to get
a sweat up, were surprised by this turn
of affairs and then began to get wor
ried and were continually calling time
and in two instances succeeded in talk
ing the referee into changing his decis
ion, and if this had not happened, Ce
lina would have had four more points
with a possible five. The rules are very
plain upon the subject touched upon and
Celina fans in general were very much
put out at the defeat of the locals when
they should have been the victors by a
margin of two or possibly three points.
At one time the score was 33 to 33 and
the fans were on their toes wondering
how it was going to come out, when
Dayton got a foul and a field basket and
the locals dropped in a foul.
Zimmerman und Marht were the star
performers for tho visitors, the former
getting 7 and the latter 3 field baskets.

DIM'S
Long and Game Fight for the
Income TaxO. K.'d
Declared Constitutional by Su
preme Court of United States
In Unanimous Decision.
Washington, Jan. 21. The income tax
was declared constitutional today by the
Supreme Court In a unanimous decision
which swept usido every contention rais
ed against it, and. In the opinion of Con
gressional lenders, opened the way for In
creasing the tax rate on great fortunes
to help pay for national defense.
Proposals are pending in Congress to
tax Incomes or more than $1,000,000 us
high us fifty per cent. Ix-udcrs on ull
sides agree thut out of the impetus which
the decision today will give such propos
als Is likely to come a definite movement
to levy on thu revenues from great pri
vate fortunes for some of the millions the
government must rulse to carry out the
army und navy Incruuscs.
The bush; error of those who attacked
the constitutionality of the tax. Chief
Justice White- held, was In regarding the
sixteenth amendment as empowering the
I, nited Slates to levy a direct lax with
out apportionment among the States in
I'lirilinir to noiiiilat loll. In substance, the
Court held that the sixteenth amendment
had not empowered the l eiierui uovern
ment to levy u new tax, but. that "the
amendment was to relieve all Income tax
es from a consideration or the source
when the income was derived."
Those opposing the tax hud urged that
the sixteenth amendment provided that
Income from "whatever source derived"
should be taxed without regard to ap
portionment among the States. They
argued that the unuerwoou-.-iimiiioiin in
come tax provision, by reason of exempt
ions of certain incomes Hum taxation,
hud not come within the meaning of the
, int. mil, it'll!
Chief Justice White said t.ie power of
the Federal Government to levy an in
come tax nau never neen que.it iuot:u.
Quoting at length from the famous in
come tax decision of lMf. he declared
the Court then recognized me luci mat
"taxation on income wus in the nature
of un excise, entitled to ue eniorceu us
such unless and until It wus concluded
that to enforce It would amount to ac
complishing the result which the require
ment as to apportionment of direct tax
ation was adopted to prevent, In which
use the duty would arise lo uisreguru
the form and consider the substance
alone and hence subject the tax to the
cgtilatlon us to apportionment wnicn ot.i-
eiwise us an excise wouiu not appiy 10
it."
Hie Court then decided, ne iiaueu, nuu
the effect of the tax on Income from real
estate was the same as if a direct tax
IimiI lieen levied on the real eslte alio
that it was with a view of obviating such
questions that the amendment Hud lieen
adopted.
Inasmuch us ine umcnumeni nuu not
conferred the power to levy un Income
tux, said the Chief Justice, it could not
In. hit, run ted as emhrucimr limitations
as to the nature and character of income
to be taxed. To consider It as emulating
limitations, such as not authorizing a pro
gressive tax, he held was Irreconcilable
u-ith the mirnose of the amendment, lie
explained, too, that the uniformity of ex
cise taxes required oy me consiiiuiioti
was geographical uniformity und not un
iformity of application us to classes.
Hie Chief justice lunner neiu mui un
tax did not violate the "due process
provision of the constitution iy imposing
higher rate oi taxation on income
above $20,(JiMJ than on those below that
figure or by other provisions.

ruined the prospects of the state fair and
the corn boy tour.
When the charges against Dunlap were
tabulated in these columns some months

their truth.
