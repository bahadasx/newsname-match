Allies Are Depending on the Albanians
to Hold the Teutons
in Check.
( V ASSOCIATKD PNCIS)
Operations which tnay have an important
bearing on the Balkan situation
are now taking place in Albania.
The situation there is somewhat
clouded but It appears that the
Austrians and Bulgarians jointly are
making the most of what appears to
be their present opportunity to overrun
the country in which little effective
opposition to their action Is apparent.
The Entente Allies seem to
be placing reliance on Essad Pasha
to hold the Teutnoic forces In check
temporarily but what measures if any
are being taken to assist him are
not yet apparent.
The Greeks are said to be re-enforcing
their detachments at the Albanian
border points and developments
as to the attitude to be adopted
by the Greek government in view
of the Bulgarian activities in southern
Albania are being closely watched
by Entente interests In Greece, according
to news agency advices from
Athens, there being some distrust, it
is said, regarding the policy of the
Greek government.
The British labor conference, after
yesterday adopting resolutions
agalns compulsion, but declining to
countenance agitation for the repeul
of the military service measure, lest
the government be cmbarassed in its
prosecution of the war, today placed
itself on record for revision of the
munitions act. The resolutions on
the subject voiced a protest against
the war being made a pretext for
greater coercion and subjection of
labor. The conference approved the
action of the executive committee of
the labor party in parliament in peri
mltting labor men to take office In
the coalition government.

AT THE

Great Congregation is Held
i Awe-Struck and Silent for
More Than an Hour.
The greatest sermon since the op
enlng of the meetings In the First
I Mathnrilut ^hiireli wrr delivered last
evening by Dr. Morrison, who held I
; blB great audience awe-struck and si
* lent tor over an hour. It was indeed
a masterpiece of pulpit oratory and
j recalled to mind the few great ser
mons which have gone down with
i such a place In history. To sec and i
hear the great Scotch evangelist from 1
: the Southland and to drink In his
wonderful sayings, rich with eloquence
and glowing with tribute to,
the majesty and power of the God
of Heaven, was but to give one a
vision of Peter at Pentecost, or Paul:
on Mars Hill. It was such a sermon
! as but few men indeed are cnpable o' <
delivering.
The chief theme of Dr. Morrison's
talk was that all men must be born |
again. However, he did not one" |
mention this great spiritual regener
ation. He cited the Btory of Dives ;
and Lazarus and did it in such a way11
that one could hear the shrieks and
groans of the rich man as he cried :
to Father Abraham for water, oniyi
to be denied by the inseparable gulf|
cutting off all communication?one
could see the beggar Lazarus trans-1
formed and resting on the bosom ot j
the holy founder of the Hebrew race
'There were many other mighty por.
trayals of Biblical scenes and time
and again were framed commonplace
parables of today, making the whole
duty of man so plain and so vivid
that no person dared deny but that
the shafts of truth went straight
home to the heart of every hearer.
When Dr. Morrison told of the loss ,
' of his father in the struggle between :
-the-North mid 3unth, hundreds uponr1
hundreds were seen si'ently weeping !|
ian<l when he showed that his tatne'i
was not really dend, but that he mere
ly awaited the time when the prison
i house ol' the soul should be broken '
and the spirit permitted to go to the '
One who gave It, there was audible,
crying on every side.
The revival services are growing !
in Interest and in results from night
to night and the attendance continues
to become greater. Professor Hiatt. 1
assisted by Mrs. Cuppet and a mighty
chorus of trained voices, is produc- 1
ing results which are beyond origl j'
nal expectations In the music line.
On Saturday afternoon there will ;
be held a great mass meeting for the
little folk of the city, while on Sunday
afternoon at 2:30 one of the'
greatest meetings for men only that
has ever been held In this section, 1
will take place. "Who Made the Devil i
| and How to Make Another," is to be j1
the subject of the Sunday sermon to;!
! the ment. It is confidently expected I
that 1,500 men will attend. . ji

The Location
a
(By (a. \V. Duddernr, secretary.treasurer
of the boiled of trade.)
Did you ever stop to consider why
.'actorles locate in any city? If not,
let me outline to you the process
tsually followed by wise and ultlnately
successful manufacturing con:erns.
Up to u period of not more than
en years ago no extensive conslderaion
seemed to be given by manufucurers
to study and Investigation of
various locations. In those times It I
vas simply to locate somewhere con-!
venlent where they would have plen-!
:y of room. The manufacturer, as
latural to expect, was more absorbed
n turning out Ills product and the
luestlon of location was a matter of
iccond thought.
Today we see the results of this,
arge as well as small concerns, are
looking for new locations, many of
them regret their present location
ind nre (nveqtlff.-itinc other sections.
n older to cut down fuel and transportation
bills. Competition in respective
lines of manufacture is now
10 keen that manufacturers desiring
o locate are beginning to go about
t in a systematic manner nnd go
nto such details as will enable them
o decide on a location that is best
suited for their particular Interests.
Usually the manufacturer who
pontemplates a change of location
ays out a general plan of his proposed
factory, making reasonable alowances
for futuro extensions, neccBinry
railroad trackB, ample storage
ind future growth, then statistics
showing data relative to the economic
issetnblage of raw material, lncludng
fuel and the distribution of finished
product are gathered as well
us a careful study made of local
;ransportatlon facilities, labor conditions,
etc.
Local City Data.
Chambers of commerce or boardB
pf trade of tho various cities being
Investigated are called into action
ind the railroad industrial agents are
tlso called upon for information.
The manufacturer usually wants ac:ess
to a map of the city showing
thereon various factory sites, their
proximity to railroad and water, he
wants information about the water
supply, whether owned by the- city,
he size of the water mains, pressure,
:oBt per thousand gallons, whether
>n flat rate or meter, analysis of
lame, etc. Question of sewage is usjaily
regarded as important In most
itates. Sanitation lawB must be
strictly observed. State board of
lealth rules muBt be looked up and
specifications of the construction of
'actory planned accordingly. While
n our city the prospective manufacturer
will look up questions of aslessed
valuations, also what percentage
this bears to real valuation, tax
rates ascertained, information of In
?? fnAinpv hi! 11,(In 0a anil I

In this connection he lnlulres
aa to fire protection, how far

cind of fire alarm system, If any,
lource of water supply for proteclon,
as all of these questions have
i strong Influence upon insurance

and fuel conditions.
Transportation Conditions.
Transportation question not only
has a direct bearing upon the assemblage
of raw muterlal and distribution
of finished product but also upon
tbc labor situation. Frolght rates
must be obtained on Various classes
of raw material, also rates on finished
products to the various markets
of the particular industry In question
in both car-load and less than
car-load lotB. In obtaining these
rates the prospective manufacturer
makes careful comparisons as they
npply to various cities being considered.
Cities having water transportation
or competing railroads usual-1
ly have considerable advantages over1
cities like Clarksburg and It Is up to
us to show other advantugeB to outweigh
these handicaps. Next to the
question of freight rates comes the
question of service. How long does
it take to make shipments to big cities
like New York, Philadelphia nnd
Chicago? What of express service to
these cities, oxpress delivery limits,
local switching service, efficient and
prompt or otherwise?
What are conditions covering construction
or sidings, terms, etc.?
Those are all leading questions, whlcb
1 ?ii* l?* a/imniielnnn
IIIUHl ut; nurncu uui ?u vumvunuvu
with conditions prevailing at other
competing locations.
Fuel and Haw Material.
Every manufacturer Is a big consumer
of fuel and raw materials and
costs of these Items, distance to haul,
etc., are all Important to him, and
these matters are carefully Investigated
from the standpoint of each
location being considered. Here again
freight rates and question of quick
delivery cuts an Important figure.
In many lines of manufacture, labor
Is a most Important subject, prevailing
ratos of wages, working
hours per day and the abundance or
scarcity of skilled or unskilled labor
Investigated, copies of labor laws, If
any, obtained. (
Labor Situation.
No matter how well a factory may
be built, how well equipped for the
safety and comfort of Its workmen,
nor how well It pays the toller, the
wnrlrtrif man will not he steadv if he
does not like the conditions of the
city In which he lives. So in considering
the labor situation, the manufacturer
will look carefully Into city
conditions as they appeal to the'
working man, such as rents, the kind ;
of houses In which working men live,
schools for the education of their
children, parks, play grounds, and
recreation centers and particularly
street car facilities for use of the
workmen.
In all this Investigation, the personality,
courtesy, tact and knowledge
of conditions as outlined shore
and appreciation of the serious problems
confronting the manufacturer
manifested by the board of trade representative
gles a long way toward
securing for the home-town the prospective
industry. Usually the board
of trade secretary, who can clearly,
truthfully and Intelligently set forth
the prevailing conditions with sufficient
Insight to emphasize those
things which might especially appeal
to (he Industry In question, who
knows how to work out various transportation
problems arising and who
exercises due courtesy and. diligence
will usually "land the bacon," but
In this work he must have the ample
backing and support of the business
Interests benefited by these Indus*
