cording to a statement made by Ter

agriculture and forestry, which held
its rexular monthly meeting this
morning. '
"With the slaughter and segregation
of all the reactors, and with the thor
ough disinfection of all premises
where reactors have been found, it
may safely be claimed that at least
90 per cent of the local dairies are

tubercular infection aay Dr? Nor
gaard In his report. -'
"Equally satisfactory conditions can
be reported from, the other islands
where the new sanitary code of the

plied the lfiiig needed authority . for
A tk vigorous campaign against the dis
case." '.
Eradication is SureJ
According to the veterinarian three
deputies on the other Islands are co
operating with, the representatives of
the health board In a manner which
Is sure to bring about the complete
eradication of the disease.
"Under these conditions," be says,
'the complete eradication of bovine
tuberculosis will require only the co
operation of the owners of the few
remaining herds where the infection
still persists In order-to be an ac
complished fact by the end of .1916."
Dr. Norgaard says that the over-
' production of milk In certain locali
ties is a sure sign that the campaign
has caused little hardship to result,

sumers in the poorer classes.

So rapidly is the hog business de

til pork packing will "have 6'be es

THE POWER OF ADVERTISING
(From System for January, 1916)
' If there are still men who ask the question Does it pay
to advertise?"! know their thinking is of the kind that would
lead them to light factories with candles and insist upon the
advantages which would accrue if the residents of modern
cities still drew their water supply by bucket from the town
well ;.';';:." CQ
"When nations in the greatest struggle of history adver
tise for armies ; when kings and emperors and sultans come
down from their thrones to. seek the attention of the world
and present their pleas and defenses through the press; when
it has become the daily bread of a large part of the world's
business, it is indeed a man of limited mentality who still ques
tions the power of publicity. Its value to society has, in fact,
so impressed itself that today publicity is the light of the
world. It may be said, with little element of speculation in the
assertion, that if publicity had characterized dealings between
the nations of Europe during the past 50 years, and secret
diplomacy had been; eliminated, the present world war, with
its terrorism and threat to all civilization, would not now be
raging. '., - . :- .. V. r:1

Great South American Nation
Looks to U. S. to Establish
Order in Mexico
That the people of Chile and other
South American countries, while not
welcoming the idea of United States
ntervention in Mexico, have come to
regard it as inevitable, so that if it
does take place they will not be sur
prised, was stated this afternoon by
Onkichi HayashL one of the two com
missioners from Japan, at the Japan
ese government's : exhibition of Jap
anese manufactures, held In Santiago,
Chile, in September and October. S.
Marimoto is the ' director-general.
Both are returning to' Japan on the
Anyo Maru, sailing this evening. .
lt would be impoesible to give
Mexico a free hand, said Mr. Hay
ashi. "There must be intervention.
perhaps not the military kind. Mexico
wants some instruction, and the Uni
ted States could give it" . .
The Japanese commissioner said
the people-of Chile feel that Presi
dent Wilson's recognition of Carran
za is the most important step towards
ultimate peace in Mexico yet accom
plished, as it prevented many more
months' of struggle between Carranza
nd Villa, who were evenly matched,
he thought, until the American gov
ernment lent its moral support to
the First Chief.
wrancnes or American banks are
necessary in Chile if Americans hope
to obtain any trade there, Mr. Mori-
moto stated. He said there are Span
isb. English, German and Italian
bank branches there now, but no Am
erican banks, although he heard that
a representative of the National City
Bank of New York was in Chile look
ing over conditions, with an eye to
perhaps establishing a branch.
The commlssoner said Japan has
been buying 30,000 tons of nitrate a
year from Chile, costing 11,500,000,
payment being made In London ex
change. He said Chile is experiencing
prosperity because of the war.
