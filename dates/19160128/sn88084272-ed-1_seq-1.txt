into Mexico to rescue two comrades
who had been captured by armed
Mexicans near Brownsville, Tex., prob
ably will result if an investigation

they probably would be held responsi

Secretary of war Garrison, who is
awaiting the outcome of the investiga

given army officers not to cross the
boundary line without instructions
from Washington.
Prompt action on the part of Car

Friendship With Another
Man Caused First Quarrel,
Says Doctor's Widow.
Providence, E. 0.. Jan. IS. At the
resumption today of the trial of Mrs.
Elizabeth Mohr and the two negroes,
Cecil Brown and Henry Spellman,
charged with the murder of Dr. C.
Franklin Mohr, attorney general Wee
renewed the cross examination of Mrs.
Mohr. She admitted she knew chief of
police Crowley, of Newport and had
I entertained him at her home.
i The alleged confession of the negro
codefendants said Mrs. Mohr told them
sh. "sfiwid in with the nolice.
The attorney general tried to bring
out that the marriage ceremony at
t Ljnn, Mass was performed for the
i purpose of permitting Mrs. Mohr to be
able to testify as the wife of the doc
, tor in a lawsuit against an insurance
' company, but this the witness denied.
Another JIan L.rna io ttuarrei.
The first serious break In the marital
relations of the late Dr. Mohr and his
wife- occurred at the time she told her
I husband of her friendship for a man
named Samuel A. McDougall. who is
now a minister In Pictou. Nova Scotia.
This statement was elicited from Mrs.
I Mohr during a severe cross examination
1 Thursday afternoon by attorney gen
; eral Rice. Step by step the prosecuting
' attorney brought out the details of
f Mrs. Moor's life. Occasionally during
i the examination she seemed confused
as to dates and facts given in her din
rect testimony, ana several times Drone
down and sobbed.
It was In 1912, she said, that she
first told Dr. Mohr about McDougall.
The doctor, she admitted, was incensed
and went to Nova Scotia to try to have
the minister unfrocked. The attorney
general then reminded her that in her
direct testimony she said that her hus
band had gone "to the province to see
a fnend."
Doctor Under Drue Inflnence.
"The doctor was under the influence
of drugs," said Mrs. Mohr. "He asked
me if I preferred McDougall to him,
and I told him that the way he was
acting. I thought McDougall would
have been better, as he did- not toueh-
liquor.
It was about the time she, told the
doctor about McDougall, the attorney
general brought out that Mrs. Mohr
and her husband had a falling out and
that he began to correspond with Miis
Emily Burger, who later became his
secretary.
Wan "Fooled" About Marriage.
Mrs. Mohr admitted that "she was
fooled" about her first marriage with
the doctor in Brooklyn, but that she
relied on the word of the doctor and
took no other precautions.
She denied that she had lived with
the doctor a jear and a half before
their marriage. When the doctor told
her, she said, that she would have trou
ble in proving that they were legally
married, as she could not produce the
certificate and that the man who per
formed the ceremony was dead, she de
cided not to live with him another day,
until there was another ceremony.
"Where was it that you really went
through a ceremony?" Mr. Rice asked.
Mrs. .Monr souDea so mat it was some
time before she could answer..
Were Slarrled in 1009.
She finally replied that she and the
doctor were married at Lynn. Mass., on
May 24. 1909. The doctor thought it
would be best she said, on account of
the children.
It was said that Mrs. Mohr probably
would be on the stand for two day
more.

Armed Merchantmen Will
Be Considered Warships
Unless Rules Adopted.
WOULD DISARM
MERCHANT SHIPS
U.S. Points Out That Equa
ble Rules, As Suggested,
Are Easy To Adopt.
WASHINGTON, D. O, Jan. 28.
The United States,. in asking
all European belligerents to
make a general agreement to square
tneir submarine wanare with the prin
ciples of humanity and International
law, has taken the position that under
changed conditions of naval warfare,
merchant ships should carry no arma
ment whatever.
All the powers have been notified
that unless they subscribe to such prin
ciples armed merchantmen will be
denied entry Into American ports ex
cept under the conditions which apply
to warships.
Nature of Proposals.
Such a proposal, now in the hands
of the belligerent governments, has
been transmitted in a note which is
substantially as follows:
"It is assumed that all the govern
ments addressed are equally desirous
of protecting their own subjects and
citizens who are noncombatants. from
the hazards of submarine warfare.
"Realizing the appalling loss of life
of noncombatants which results from
the destruction of a merchant vessel
without removing passengers and crews
to places of safety, which is held to be
violative of the principles of humanity

ihe right to use submarines in view
of the usefulness to which they have
developed.
Formula of Prlnrtple.
"That a formula may be found com
pletely within the rules of Internation
al law and of humanity which will re
sult in the adoption of only a trifling
change in the practices which have
obtained in the past and before the
war, which formula would be Just and
fair to all belligerents. It is proposed
that:
"First: A noncombatant has the
right to traverse the high seas In a
merchantship entitled to fly a belliger
ent flag, and rely upon the rules of in
ternational law and the principles of
humanltv If the vessel i nnnrn:ichi1
by a belligerent war vessel.
"Second. A merchant vessel of anv
nationality should not be subject to
attack until the belligerent warship
has warned her to stop.
3Iut Obey Order to Stop.
"Third: Any belligerent-owned mer
chant vessel should promptly obey any
order from a belligerent warship to
stop.
"Fourth- No' such merchant vessel
should be fired on unless she tries to
flee or to resist by force and even In
such case any attack upon her by the
warship must stop as soon as the flight
or resistance ceases.
"Fifth: Only In case It should be
Impossible, for military reasons, for the
warships to supply a prize crew or con
vo the ship Into port will she be
Justified in sinking such merchantman,
and in that case passengers and crew
must be removed to a place of safety.
Submarine Weakness Is Obstacle.
"The state department Is fully ap
preciative of the obstacles which the
adaption of these rules would place in
the way of the operations of the sub
marines because of their structural
weakness.
"Before the present war maritime
warfare on the high seas always has
been conducted by battleships or cruis
ers carrying heavy guns. It Is true that

biggest bow In the state, which is
owned by Gov. Hunt '"s borrowed
for this purpose, but even it did not
have the necessary power. X small
cannon was manufactured with some
brass pipe, a line was tied to a leaden
ball and the ball reached the middle
of the stream, propelled by a heavy
charge of powder. A bigger gun was
built and more powder used. This
attempt proved successful and two cop
per wires were dragged across the Gila.
The Mountain States and Western
