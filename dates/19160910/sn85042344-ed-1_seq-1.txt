Tonight both sides claimed the elec

J, ooo, tho Republicans by 1 6,000.
Not before In recent years has so
determined an effort been made to
make a showing on the country at
large which expects to find Its politi
cal pulse In Maine's vote on Monday.
Local speakers emphasized Mate Is
sues and the personalities ,f candi
dates, but tho big speakers from other
states oither have attacked or been
employed In defense of the adminis
tration or the only Democrat to re
ceive Maine's electoral vote since
Franklin Pierce was elected president
tn 1S52.
An eleventh hour development was
mo nmrung or tlio Republicans' at
tack from the administration's for
elgn policy In particular to the tariff
question. At the campaign opening
Republican speakers, notably Theo
dore Roosevelt, bitterly a.ssulled the
president's conduct of International
al fairs.
Mr. Hughes today launched an at
tack on the administration's shipping
bill which ho described us a menaco
to American shipping. Maine always
has been a protection slate and her
shipping Interests uro great. There
was a disposition In both parties to
night to hedge when it enme to giving
tlio exact figures of the vote that
would bo accepted as significant from
a national standpoint. A Democratic
victory by any margin, though, will be
claimed as an endorsement of tho
president, while a fairly good-sized
Republican plurality will bu hailed by
that party as an augury of nutlonal
success In November.
A governor, auditor, four congress

county officers will be chosen. of

TO MAKE PROTEST
BY VIGOROUS STEP
Remarks of Lloyd deorgo

MAY FORBID EXPORTS
No Surprise at Remarks of
British Minister That no
Change Will Come.
ITTAKHINGTo.V, Sept 9. Any
TT proof thnt Great Britain is using
trade Information secured from In
terccptcd neutral muil In her htruggli-
for commercial supremacy probably
would be followed by vigorous bIoiih
by the American government to se
cure abandonment of the policy.
A stat'.inint made during a tarlfr
debate In parliament recently by
Timid Lloyd -George, the British war
secretary, that such Information prop
erly could be put to "any public and
national use" is regarded by officials
here aa opening the way for practices
which would Work Inestimable Injury
to American Interests. While tho
ttato department ilecllnol to mako
any comment pending a full investiga
tion of the exact meaning of the Wir
secretary'" declaration, thero were
many evidences that the policy ho
suggested ass loved ;i3 uiibiippoi't
nble In international law.
Discussion of the subject brought
out the suggestion that although the
Phelati amendment denying use of
American mall, cable, telegraph and
express privileges to eitizeiis of foreign
countries intei feriiiK with American
mulls wus stricken out of the retalia
tory legislation recently proposed by
congress, the measure us enacted con
tains authorizations which might bu
construed as broad enough to allow
I be president to retaliate against tin
talr use of the ceiiHorshi p. Many of
ficials believe that If it cun bo .shown
thai British firms have an unfair ad
vantage over American firms because
of legislation proposed as a result of
Infill million uanied illegally from the
censfirsbi p, the president couid forbid
importation into this country of the
products of whatever industries are
uffectcd. As the disputed illegal use
of the censorship looked to the raising
nf a tariff wall rather than by Indi
vidual companies, American retalia
tion, It is figured, could be pushed as
fur as desired.
No siirjniMc was felt here today at
the statement of Lord Robert Cecil.
British minister of trad., that "It is
not likely that Great Britain will
change her blacklist policy at the re
quest of the tinted States." Officials
(lid not expect enactment of tho re
taliatory legislation to bu met by any
announcement of concessions by Great
Britain, but rather by a modification
here and a slight change there, till
the whole trado situation had been
eased up and softened to remove the
most threatening of Amcrcui's ob
jections. YAOLI INDIANS ON HAM PAGE.
