EIGHT NEGRDLS
SHOT AT PICNIC
LAST FRIDAY
FOUR BAD "NIGGERS" ARE NOW
IN JAIL WITH SERIOUS CHARGE
LODGED AGAINST THEM ONE
SERIOUSLY INJURED.
Four bar "niggers" with a shot gun
and pistols threw consternation Into
the ranks of a negro picnic that was
heing held at the Caddo bridge be
tween this city and Berwyn Friday
night, when the. quartette referred to
got peeved at some real or fancied
wrong and began working a Winches
ter shot gun overtime, accompanied
by a big forty-odd.
It seems that the four Berryman
brothers, alh ged trouble-makers at all
negro gatherings, were at the picnic
and began a little rough stun. Some
of the other negroes remonstrated
with them about their actions and
were Informed that they would re
pair to their home, get out the nrtll
lcry and smoke the picnic up. All the
other negroes thought it a bluff and
had practically forgotten the Incident
when the bombardment started short
ly after dark. When the scattered
clans had regathered it was found
that eight of the picnickers had more
or less punctures in their anatomy,
while the Herrymans were hitting the
pike in other directions. Two of
the negroes were brought to the Har
dy sanitarium for treatment Friday
night and two others yesterday morn
ing. The most seriously hurt is one
Jess Organ, w ho was shot about the
head and will probably lose an eye.
Deputies left for the scene of the
shooting and captured three of the
brothers last night and brought them
to the county jail. Deputy Kendall
remained over night and yesterday
morning captured the fourth one, and
he Is now keeping them company.
Information was filed against them
yesterday morning charging assault
with attempt to kill.
