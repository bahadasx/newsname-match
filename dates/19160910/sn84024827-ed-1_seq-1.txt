RETALIATION BILL IS

If Investigation Proves Abuses

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 9. Any proof
that Great Britain is using trade in
formation secured from intercepted
neutral mail in her struggle for com
mercial supremacy probably will be
followed by vigorous steps by the
American government to secure aban
donment of the policy.
A statement was made during a tar
iff debate in parliament recently by
David Lloyd-George, the British war
secretary, that such Information prop
erly could be put to "any public and
national use." ,
Discussion :of the subject brought
out the suggestion that although the
Phelan amendment denying the use of
American mail, cable, telegraph and
express privileges to citizens of for
eign countries interferring with Amer
ican mails, was stricken out of the re
t2liatory legislation recently passed
by congress, the meauure as enacted
contains authorizations which might
be construed as broad enough to allow
the President to retaliate against tin
fair use of the censorship.
U. S. May Stop Support
Many officials believe that if .it, can
be shown that British firms have tak
en an unfair advantage over Ameri
can firms by obtaining trade informa
tion from the censorship, .the Presi
dent could forbid importation to this
country of the products of whatever
industries are affected.
U. S. To Go Far
As. the dispute of the censorship
looked to the raising of the tariff
wall-against neutral commerce and
this wall would be laid by industries
rather than by individuals or compan- j
ies, American retaliation, it is argued,
could be pushed as far as desired.
Retaliation will not be seriously
contemplated, it is believed Until a
thorough investigation of Lloyd
George's purpose has been made and
then only if there are proofs that the
trid information actually is being
put to the uses he suggested.
Another British Bluff
No surprise was felt here todav at
the statement of Lord Robert Cecil
British minister of trade, that "it is
not likely that Great Britain will
change her blacklist policy at the re
quest of the United States."
Officials did not expect enactment
of the ret3liatory legislation to be
met by announcement of concession
ty Great Britain, but rather by a mod
Iflcation here and a slight change
there until the whole trade regulation
has been softened to agree to the
most urgent of American objections.

Only two slight "wet"- demonstra

the speaker to have some. He did it
in such a low voice, however, that few
persons noticed it and Landrith paid
no heed to the interruption.
Again at Madison four young men

ing disapproval and later honked
their automobile horn.
President Wilson's remarks at At

quently by both J. Frank Hanly, the
prohibition candidate for president,
and Landrith, during the day. Hanly
said that the president had fallen in
to line with the suffragists and there

Landrith asserted that if the prohibi

their demands upon the two big par
ties as the suffragists, both would
have written dry planks in their plat

Hanly charged Charles V. Fairbanks

' NEW LONDON, SepL 9. American
members of the joint commission on
consideration of relations between the
United States and Mexico are finding
some difficulty in devising a satisfac
tory plan to insure order along the
international border. The full com
mission was not in session tonight,
but Secretary Lane and Judge Gray,
of the American commission, decided
to summon expert military judgment
to their assistance. For that purpose
they asked that Major General Tasker
H. Bliss, assistant chief of i-taff of
the army, be sent to New LonC'jn to
confer with them. He is expected to
arrive Monday when the conimijjsijn
resumes its sitting.
The commission has not attempted
to go beyond the immediate problem
of the bonier. It is indicated that a
comprehensive scheme is being souglu
under which each section of the linj
will be treated the way best suited -'j
its physical peculiarities. It is for
this that General Bliss' opinion will
be sought. The wider scope of the
commission sought by the Washing
ton government will be reached later.
It was stated authoritatively today
that the subject of possible loans to
the Carranza government had not been
mentioned and that there was L'Jthri-;
to indicate such a project would come
up.
It is expected long sessions will be

NEW. YORK. SepL 9. The national
foreign trade rouncil made public to-'
day a report on the probable effects of
of the European economic alliances
upon 1'nited States commerce, point
ing out, among other things, that one
great need of the near future would
be the education of the American pub
lic in the importance of treaty mak
ing power.
"More treaty making." the report
says, "will be in progress in the five
years after the declarat.'jn of peace
than in any similar period of the
world's history. The state depart
ment should Immediately provide
skilled resources for the study of the
entire treaty situation. The education
of American public into treaty mak
ing is imperative.
"Investigation reveals that the
United States in the last normal year
before the war sent 77.16 per cent of
its exports to the belligerent coun
tries and derived 73.25 per cent of its
imports from them."
Attention is called to the allies'
policy by direct subsidy to foreign
trade and its possible effect on Ameri
can oversea enterprises. The report
adds:
"The recovery of a portion or the
American f.'jld reserve which supports
an unprecedented structure jf domes
tic and foreign credit is essential to
the restoration of European prosperity
after the war and this would logically
seem to be one effect of the economic
alliances now being devised and the
plans being laid for more intensive
competition which will bring back the
trade which by the curtailment of
European production and competition
has given American merchandise a
greater access to European markets
and a larger share of neutral trade.
