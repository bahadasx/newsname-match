NO SUCCESSOR AS
YET ELECTED
Work of Organization Will Not
Be Hampered, but will Pro
ceed at Usual.
After having efficiently served the
Chamber of Commerce of Columbus
and Lowndes county as secretary
and manager for a period .covering
several months, Mr. J. G. Weatherly
has tendered his resignation, and as
he was forced to immediately relin
quish his duties the directors have
not as yet had time to secure an ex
ecutive to succeed him. They are de
termined, however, not to act hastily
as they desire a thoroughly efficient
and competent man, and until such a
man can be secured the place will
remain vacant. In the meantime, Miss
Ella Mae Jordan, who has been in
the employ of the Civic Chamber for
nearly a year, will keep the office
open, and the directors will see that
the business is properly conducted.
Theyrill give all correspondence
their prompt attention and no letters
will remain unanswered.
The annual election of officers for
the ensuing year will be held Tues
day, September 26, and in naming
these officers the referendum plan
will be adhered to. This plan contem
plates the nomination of three candi
dates for each office to be filled, and
after nominations have been turned
in the members vote on same, and
the candidates receiving the largest
number of votes are declared elected.
While hard trM hrve ' i fvw
the Civic Chamber f voni hi ig f.r
Columbus any factories, or industrial
enterprises of great magnitude, the
organization has by no means been
idle, and during the past few months
a great deal of efficient , work has
been quietly accomplished. Now that
the fall season is approaching, how
ever, the directors anticipate more
activity along industrial lines, and
will put forth every effort to keep
Columbus before the public and to
add to its prosperity and progress in
every conceivable way. With this
end in view a thoroughly competent
and experienced man will be em
ployed as secretary-manager, and
with such a man in charge of its af
fairs the organization will be in a
better position than ever before to
work for the upbuilding of Columbus
and the contiguous territory.
2. 1. BRANTLEY. STATE C1E
WN1KES SPEECH HERE
EXPLAINS GAME AND FISH LAWS
OF MISSISSIPPI TO LO- '
CAL CITIZENS.
Hon. Z.A. Brantley .state game and
t fish commissioner, delivered an ad
dress at the court house here Fri
daynight. The object of the address
was to acquaint local citizens with
the game and fish laws of Mississippi
as enacted by the legislature at its
recent session, and the commissioner
explained these laws thoroughly and
cogently, having made them so plain
that a child could easily understand
their full meaning.
Within the borders of Lowndes
county there are a great many sports
men who devote considerable time to
hunting and fishing, and as they are
all law-abiding citizens they were
glad to have the game and fish laws
thoroughly explained, so that they
can refrain from breaking them.

HENRY FORD SUES TRIBUNE
FOR 51,000,000 DAMAGES
AUTOMOBILE MAKER CLAIMS
THAT EDITORIAL BROUGHT
DISGRACE.
Chicago, Sept. 9. Suit for $1,000
000 was filed by Henry Ford, the De
troit manufacturer, against the Chica
go Tribune in the United States dis
trict court here Thursday. Mr. Ford
asks for personal damages as com
pensation for an editorial printed in
the Tribune June 23, which it is
charged', called Ford "an anarchist."
The bill charges "that the Tribune
sought to bring the plaintiff into pub
lic hatred, contempt, ridicule and fi
nancial injury" by publishing the ed
itorial.
The editorial, it is charged, refer
red to Mr. Ford as " ignorant; a de
luded human being," and " an anar
chistic enemy Wthe nation which pre
lects him in hiMvealth.
The editorial was based on the re
port that Mr. Ford's employes
would lose their places if they went to
the border as members of the Nation
al Guard. The bill quotes the edito
rial as saying: "Ford is an anarchist."
"Inquiry at the Henry Ford offices
in Detroit discloses the fact that em
ployes of Ford who are members of
or recruits in the National Guard
will lose their places. No provision
will be made for anyone dependent
upon them. Their wages will stop,
their families may get along in any
fashion possible, their positions will
be filled and if they come back safely
and apply for their jobs again they
will be on the same footing as any
other applicants. This is the rule of
the Ford employes everywhere.
I "Information was refused as to the
i number of American soldiers unfor
. . : .
tunat enough to have Henry Ford
as an employer at this time, but at
the Detroit recruiting office it was
said that about 75 men will pay their
price for their services to-their coun
try." .
The editorial continues:
"Mr. Ford thus proves that he does
not believe in service to the nation
in the fashion a soldier must serve it.

Japan will not inform the United
States of her new demands on China
unless information is specifically re

American rights were neither violat

was under no more obligation to dis

ernment than the United States was
under obligaion to discuss the Mex

make nearly 1,000 stops before the

Heretofore a limited number of
teachers have slept in the dormito

that all the dormitory spare is to be

Not only will members of the col

LOSS OF $7.50 PER BALE
HAS LEEN EXPERIENCED
DURING PAST WEEK
ESTIMATE SHOWS
HEAVY GINNING
Total of 850,032 Bales Had
Been Picked and Packed up
to September 1.
A sharp reaction has followed the
buoyancy which permeated the cot
ton market during the closing days
of August, and the past week ha
witnessed comparatively steady de
cline in prices, the total loss having
! amounted to about 150 points, which
Is tantamount to something like $7.50
per bale.
A bearish ginning repor on Friday
had the effect of helping along the
downward trend in prices. It was
generally known that ginnings had
been rather heavy, and a report of
something like 600,000 was antici
pated, but the government figures
showing that 850,032 bales had been
ginned prior to September 1 was so
bearish in its nature that heavy sell
ing immediately followed and the
market took another slump.
A report that the cotton exchange
in Liverpool may soon close its
doors has been another potent fac
tor in weakening the market. There
is general belief in England that pres
ent prices are entirely too high, and it
is contended that these prices have re
sulted largely from the activities on
the part of the English spinners, who
have been insistent in their demands
for cotton and who for several weeks
have kept the market firm by con
tinued purchases of the staple.
Yesterday's session brought anoth
the mtu-kei, the to!U loss on th djy
having been betwen 15 and 20 points.
At the close of business yesterday
afternoon New York spots were quot
ed at 14.98, December futures in
New York at 15.15, New Orleans
