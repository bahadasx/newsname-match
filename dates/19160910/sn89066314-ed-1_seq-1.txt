By United Press.
NEWARK, N. J.. .Sept. &. Forty
thousand persona thronged the stands
and dotted the hills near Weehaqulc
Park this afternoon and watched the
most prominent athletes in the coun
try shatter six A. A. U. records In the
annual Senior Championship event.
Running against the best hurdlers
of the country. Robert 1. Simpson, the
University of Missouri star, today dem
onstrated his claim to the title of
"world's greatest hurdler" by winning
the 120-yard classic in the National
A. A. U. Meet held here today. Simp
son's time was 14 4-5 seconds, setting
a new record for the A. A- U. meets
and coming within one-fifth second
of his own world's record time of 14
3-5 seconds.
Fred Kelly, former world's cham
pion and star of the far west, gave
Simpson a close race, but was not
equal to the Missouri boy's pace and
finished two yards behind the cham
pion. Thompson, the Iceland Stanford won
der, who has been timed in 14 4-5 on
the coast, ran third. Thmopson was
looked upon as the mm who might
beat Simpson and his poor showing
was a surprise to all. Thompson,
known as "the freshman wonder" has
beaten everything on the coast this
summer.
Murray .who beat Simpson in the A.
A. U. meet at San Francisco last year,
finished fourth.
Because of the conflicts in the pre
liminaries of the low hurdles and the
(finals of the highs, Simpson confined
himself to the high event, deciding at
the last minute not to compete in the
220-yard distance.
The summaries were as follows.

homa, Colorado, Texas, New Mexico,

matriculates are graduates from ac
credited high schools. President St.
Clair-Moss beieves that the junior
college idea Is developing rapidly thru
out the Middle West and that an in
creased number of high school grad
uates will come to the standardized
junior Colleges of Missouri from neigh
boring states.
Come From Other Schools.

dents who have completed the fresh
man year In a standard college or
university. Christian has registered

CHAMP CLARK LAUDS FARM
Says It Is the Greatest Physlqae-RniW-

"The farm is the greatest, grandest
physique-building gymnasium in all
the world," eays Champ Clark, speak
er of the House of Representatives,
which ended its session Friday. "At
least nine-tenths of my health today
is due to the farm, where I did some
thing of everything breaking rock,
splitting rails, digging post holes,
hoeing corn, following the plow in the
new-turned earth, swinging the scythe
and the cradle for there were no
reapers until I was quite a big lad.
"Some of the healthiest and most
rugged men In Congress were reared
on a farm. And more than that, most
of the prominent men in our history
have come from the farm, there being.
of course, exceptions to this rule
The ibest exercise in the world for
i physical, arid therefore mental de
velopment is to be found In routine
woUt on a farm. It means the uplift
and unkeep of the race," Speaker Clark
concluded.

M,U, CADET OFFICERS
ORGANIZE NEW CLUB
'The Barracks" Is Name of
New Organization Rents
Welch Academy.
32 CHARTER MEMBERS
Purpose Is to Bring Univer
sity Soldiers Into Closer
Working Order.
When school opens at the University
on the 18th, perhaps (he newest or
ganization that-wil be found here will
be "The Barracks,'' a club composed
of thirty-two officers and non-commissioned
officers of the military
corps- The new club, through Us
president. R- S. Rameyi of Springfield,
Mo. signed, on August 1, a contract
with Colonel J. B. Welch for the nee
during the coming school year of the
Welch Military Academy and grounds
comprising an area of fourteen oeree,
and as soon as the charter members
of the organization arrive here they
will take up their living quarters in
the new location.
The movement for the formation of
a military) club of this kind was launch
ed before the close of school last year.
At that time the thirty-two officers
and non-commissioned officers in
school signed a mutual bond to see
the project through. These men will
compose the charter members of the
organization and, therefore, will not be
required to pay membership fees
After the tentative plans had been
made for the formation of the new
club last year the following officers
were elected to serve for one year;
R. S. Ramey, Springfield, Mo., presi
dent; W. P. Maring, Jr-. Carthage, Mo..
Secreary and Treasurer; T. M. Cor
nell, Kansas City, cfctmmisary.
Efficient Privates to Re Admitted.
According to F. M. Darr, one of the
charter members of the club who is
acting as temporary president until
Ramey returns to school, the- organi
zation will have none of the aspects
of a fraternity. There will bo no ri
tual or initiatory ceremony with the
exception that every new member who
is admitted to the club after the be
ginning of school, other than the char
ter members, will be charged a nomi
nal entrance fee. The organization,
also, will net be confined solely to of
ficers. Those privates .whose -work
in military the commanding officers
think should merK their future promo
tion will be considered as members
and by a two-thirds vote of the organ
ization will 'be admitted.
The members of the "The Barracks"
will have the use of thirty-two rooms
on the second floor of their new location-
A suite of three rooms on the
first ffcor will be occupied by Sergeant
and Mrs. A. D. Thompson of the Uni
versity Military faculty, who will act
as chaperons. The remaining rooms
on this floor will be converted into a
lounging room, dining room, library,
kitchen and office for the secretary-
treasurer of the club. In the basement
will be the wash rooms, bath roome,
service quarters, store rooms, and
smoking rooms. The entire space on
the second floor of the building will
be occupied by the roomers. The at
tic will be used entirely for storage
purposes.
When asked this morning what ttie
underlying purpose of the new organ
ization was, acting President Darr
said:
"The primary purpose of this club is
to tike another step toi bringing the
officers and men of the military corps
Into a closer working order so that
more real efficiency can be had in
military training. We believe that hy
the men living together where they
can discuss in common military top
ics, we have done a great deal to get
them working together with more har
mony." GOLF CHAMPION WINS AGAIN
