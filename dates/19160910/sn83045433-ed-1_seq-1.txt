Hughes tonight closed the Stote
campaign in Maine with a slashing
attack upon the administration's
shipping bill.
He launched this new offensive at
Brunswick this morning with a
charge that the measure was "a di
rect menace to the shipping interests
of the country." As a measure to
meet a temporary exigency, he said.
it ws almost rdleulous. and that it
held out nothing but disaster for the
-hip-building industry of the United
States.
The assault gathered force as the
Republican candidate moved later to
day to Bath, a "fine old home pf the
shipbuilding interests of the country."
It culminated tonight at an old-fash
loned political demonstration which
cheered Hughes' utterances for more
than three minutes.
The campaign ends with the result
in grave doubt. On his final day
Hughes acceded to the demands of
the party managers and mentioned
by name Fred Hale and Bert Fernald,
the two Republican Renatorial candi
dates. lfH continued to strike out on

MILK PRICE RISE
THREATENS CITY'
Dealers Claim Profits Impos
sible Under Conditions.
Maryland and Virginia milk producers
held a meeting in the Raleigh Hotel
yesterday to consider a raisv in price
of that commodity In the wholesale mar
ket. While no definite aon was taken.
it is conceded by a majority of the lead
Ing milk dealers of Washington that
housewives may expect to pay an ad
ditional price in the near future.
One of the salient features of the
prospective raise by the producers, is its
effect upon the sale of milk by the glass
in lunch rooms and restaurants. This
question will depend upon the amount
added bv the producers to the already
high price demanded by the local dealers,
who are dependent uppn Maryland and
Virginia farmers for su gplies. and who in
turn deliver to this trade.
According to A. i. Trundle, general
manager of the White Cross Milk Com
pany, an'I who has been prominent in
the Washington trade for more than
twenty years, it is doubtful if the whole
sale price contemplated by the producers.
can be made low enough to tvade a rise
in this connection. While he did not at
ticipate a great advance in this line, he
said that he felt certain Washington busi
ness men would be compelled to pay more
for their noonday lunch milk than at
present.
In speaking further of the prospects for
a higher price in milk. Mr. Trundle said
that even now, many of the smaller firms
were selling the product at complete loss.
He said that there were at present many

BRITISH THREAT
BLOCKED ATTACK
ON BLACKLIST
4igh Authority States Eng
land Planned to Cancel
Munition Orders.
New York. Sept. 10.-The American this
morning prints the following:
Washnigton-The New York American's
*orrespondent In Informed by a high
D)enocratic autority that a British
hreat to countermand all orders for
nunitions from this country led to the
'ilmicination of the Phelan and Chain
->rlain amendments from the revenue
>ill.
Those amendments were intended as
in effective retaliation against British
)lacklisting of American firms and the
British hold-up of American mails on
ieutral steamers.
All the war munitions contracts have
lanses permitting cancellation under cer
atn conditions. Mr. Wilson did not
want "war prosperity" in the United
tates disturbed by a blow at the mu
lition trade just before election. He
'Ielded to the fhreat, and the most effec
lve measures for rjtaliation were dis
arded.
The back-down of the administration at
he last moment is all the more remark
Lble because the Phelan amendment had
>een submitted to the State Department
efore It was adopted by the Senate For
ign Relations Committee. Senator
Thamberlain declared that his amend
nent had also been apwoved by the
'resident and every member of the Cabi
let. Roth amendments were expected to
ass without opposition in Congress. but
were suddenly stricken out upon orders
rom the White House without explana
Ion.
It Is understood that Ambassador
pring Rice delivered the warning that if
he amendments were passed. England
would cancel war munition contracts now
mounting to more than 500,0'0 a day.
A similar threat by England is said
a have caused the sudden reversal by
'resident Wilson of his own end his
art5's solemn promises respecting free
olls for American coastwise -hips in the
'anama Canal.
England in that case was getting up a
oint note by the powers of Europe. pro
esting against any favors to American
hips in the canal built exclusively with
tmerican money, it is said.
Hearing of this move by England. Pres
dent Wilson is said to have demanded
he Immediate repeal of the Panama
'anal tolls act passed by the previous
ongress.
