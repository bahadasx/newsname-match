Andrew Miller Suggests That Pol
itics Is at Bottom of
Opposition.
DEFENDANTS DECLARE
ACTION IS IMMATURE
Judge Ellsworth of Jamestown
Is Brought Into Case at
Eleventh Hour.
Judge Nuessle will announce his de­
cision upon the application of certain
property owners for a temporary in­
junction to restrain the city com'mis
sion from letting the paving contracts
in District No. 2 Monday at 10 a. m.
He disposed of the contention that the
statute is unconstitutional, under
which the city commissioners pro
ceeded by stating that it would not be
considered in this litigation. The
chief issue to be determined is the
suggested contract to be entered into
with the city engineer relative to the
increasing amount of work to be
done under the paving contract.
Battey's Affidavit
In this connection, Commissioner
Battey, chairman of the city commis­
sion paving committee, has made an
affidavit in which he alleges: "that the
city commission has never authorized
the city engineer to increase or de­
crease the amount of the work which
shall be performed under the paving
contract that no formal action at any
time has been taken giving him the
right to do so that the provisions re­
ferred to is a paragraph in a suggest­
ed form of contract."
Miller Suggests Motive.
All day was spent in the arguments
yesterday. At times they waxed
slightly acrimonious. Andrew Miller
of counsel for the city suggested to
the court that political considerations
had entered into the opposition to
paving from certain parties who were
shielding behind the litigants at bar.
Their only interest, he continued, was
to delay the paving project, thus
throwing Itjnfo the city election next
spring. .Much of the opposition, he
contended, "fame from those who had
been unable to "horn in."
Want to Fish.
"If this project is delayed they will
go fishing for the next twq or three
months," he said, -"in order to catch
something."
He rebuked R. N. Stevens, attorney
for applicants, for certain personali­
ties indulged in during the morning
session.
Morning Session.
Andrew Miller, former attorney gen­
eral, made the chief argument in de­
fense of the commission's action. As­
sociated with him are C. L. Young and
F. E. McCurdy, city attorney. His
argument was in reply to the conten­
tions of the paving protestants repre­
sented by R. N. Stevens, F. H. Regis­
ter and Judge Ellsworth of James­
town.
Before arguments were presented,
Mr. Miller filed with the court a de­
murrer to the complaint together with
an affidavit from P. C. Battey, chair­
man of the paving committee of the
city commission, stating that the city
has entered into no contract with any
paving concern, selected no kind of
pavement or in any way obligated it­
self.
This laid the foundation for the at­
tack upon the complaintants' position
by Mr Miller and his associates that
the action was premature and the
complaint drawn irrelevant.
Legislative Function.
"The necessity or propriety for this
improvement," said Mr. Miller, "is not
a question for the court. It is purely
a legislative matter vested solely with
the city commission. The city com­
mission has absolute power to deter­
mine the propriety of the improve­
ment and it is not reviewable by this
court.
"There can be but two objections
raised. First, whether the city com­
mission proceeded without authority,
or second, whether fraudulently.
Conformed to Law.
Mr. Miller showed that the author­
ity was vested in the commission to
proceed with paving when, in the
opinion of the members, such an im­
provement was deemed necessary. He
took up the various steps in the pro­
cedure showing that in each instance
the actions of the commission were in
conformance with the laws of the
state.
"No one knows," he said, "what the
cost of this improvement will be. The
complainants have arbitrarily taken
two or three kinds of pavements and
figured out their confiscations-. We
believe that they have shown consid­
erable nerve to come before the court
with such a flmsy contention. No one
knows but that a cheaper paving will
be used than any of those upon which
the complainants base their conten­
tions that the improvement will be
confiscatory.
When Tax is Levied.
"The time for these complainants to
come into court is when the tax is lev­
ied. Then if the assessment is great­
er than the benefits, it is the £uty of

SEND IN BALLOTS
Portland, Me., Sept. 9.—The state
campaign closed tonight, after a total
of 292 set speeches had been crowded
into the final 24 hours. One hundred
meetings were addressed by men
whose national prominence assured a
packed house. Supplementing this un­
precedented volume of oratory, were
brass bands, red fire, organized cheer­
ing and a revivial of old-time torch
light parading.
Portland, Me., Sept. 9.—Political
conditions have created a 'widespread
interest in the general election in
Maine, the earliest to be held in the
country and always regarded by poli­
ticians as a possible forecast of the
national vote for president. The vot­
ers will go to the polls on Monday
next to ballot for two United States
senators, four members of congress,
governor, state auditor and members
of the legislature. In addition, they
will decide by referendum whether
to endorse the bills passed by the
legislature to limit the labor of wom­
en and children to 54 hours a week
and to provide for state aid in the
building of bridges.
Key to Situation.
The destination of the Progressive
party vote, released by the decision
of the party leaders not to maintain
a separate ticket, is the key to the
situation. Although the Republicans
are confident that practically all of
the Progressives will return to their
former affiliation, the Democrats dis­
pute the contention and have made
vigorous efforts to attract the .Pro­
gressives. In the last presidential
year the .Progressives cast 48,495
votes for Roosevelt, while Taft re­
ceived 26,545 and Wilson carried the
state, with 51,113. In the state cam­
paign for 1914 the Democrats again
were victorious, electing Oakley C.
Curtis as governor, with a vote of 62,
076, to 58,887 for the Republican can­
didate and 18,226 for the Progressive
nominee. The Republicans in each
year elected three members of con­
gress and the Democrats one.
In recognition of the unusual situ­
ation state issues were almost en­
tirely subordinated in the campaign
this year. National leaders of the
Democratic and Republican parties
bombarded the state with their heav­
iest artillery, mobilized to an extent
unequaled in this state since the
memorable year when James G.
Blaine of Maine was a candidate for
president. President Wilson did not
come, but his campaign addresses
were made by several members of
his cabinet, Democratic senators and
members of the house and others
prominent in the party. The Repub­
licans sent many of their strongest
speakers, and arranged as »a climax
addresses by Theodore Roosevelt
last week and by their national stand­
ard-bearer, Charles E. 'Hughes, in the
final week of the contest. On both
sides the record of the Wilson admin­
istration formed the central topic of
nearly every speech. The Demo­
crats dwelt chiefly on the fact that
the country had been kept out of
war and on the prevailing prosperity.
The Republicans directed their heavi­
est attacks against the Democratic
tariff policy and the president's con­
duct of Mexican and European prob­
lems.
Many Local Contests.
In opposition to Governor Curtis,
who seeks re-election, the Republic­
ans nominated Carl E. Milliken of
Island Falls, former president of the
state senate and known as a ''Roose­
velt Republican." For senator the
Democrats renominated Senator Ch^s.

Subject of Possible Loans to the
Carranza Government Has
Not Been Discussed.
New London, Conn., Sept. 9.—Amer­
ican members of the joint commission,
considering the relations between the
United States and Mexico, are finding
some difficulty in devising satisfac
tory plans to insure peace along the
international boundary. The full com
mission was not in session tonight, but
Secretary Lane and Judge Gray of the
American commission, after an all day
struggle with the various plans sug
gested for policing the border, decided
to summon expert military judgment
to their assistance. For that purpose
they asked that Major General Kas
kar J. Bliss, assistant chief of staff of
the army, be sent to New London to
confer with them. He is expected to
arrive Monday.
It was stated authoritatively today
that the subject of possible loans to
the Carranza government had not
been mentioned by either commission
and there was htnoing to indicate
such a project would come up. For
the present, at least, the border situa­
tion is the only r«^e being considered
with the idea of bringing immediate
concrete results.
It is expected long sessions will be
held every day next week, and that a
border plan will have been virtually
completed in that time, ready for sub­
mission to the Washington and Mexi­
co City governments for ratification.

Mandan will be represented today
at the meeting t)f the Equity com
mittee at iFargo, when it will go over
again the site proposed for the mil
lion-dollar packing plant, which will
be built either at Fargo or the Mor
ton county city.
W. J. Prater, county treasurer and
chairman of the Republican Central
committee, strong in Non-partisan
and Equity circles, left last night on
No. 2 to attend the meeting as the
representative of the Bismarck Com
mercial club. With him went C. A.
Swanson of Driscoll, one of the di
rectors of the state branch of the
American Society of ^BcSity. They
will do their best to secure the plant
for Mandan.
Ray McKaig, secretary of the Re­
publican State Central committee, and
President Newton of the 'Mandan
Commercial club left on the same
train.
According to a report received from
Fargo last night, practically the en­
tire state has lined up with iMandan
in the fight, save the territory im­
mediately surrounding the Cass coun­
ty city.
This attitude is due, it is said, not
alone to the fact .that Fargo has al­
ready many of the Equity institu­
tions, but that iMandan really has
come forward with better offers and
is better situated, being the natural
point at which much of the cattle
raised in the west would be sent for

Officials Are Criticized Adverse­

Accountings.
St. Paul, Minn., Sept. 9—Hibbing,
iMinn., famed as the "richest village
in the world," has suffered shortages
and overcharges of-*! nearly $62,000
during the past fl*e years, according
to a report filed wi'ft Governor J. A.
A. Burnquist here, late today, by
State .Public Examiner Rue E. Fritz.
The legality of other transactions in­
volving $48,250 additional village
funds is questioned.
The report shows how the village
receipts went up from $333,950 In
1910 to more than *900,000 in 1914,
and the expenditures from- $303,000 in
1910, to $1,233,700 in 1914.
Another comparison discloses that
in iMarch, 1915, 1,296 persons were
on the village payrolls and 1,710 vot­
ers cast ballots for mayorality candi­
dates in the village election.
Mayor Victor L. Power is mention­
ed but once in the report, and then
as one of a number of officials criti­
cized for accepting claims for collec­
tion against village employes. This
is In connection with a statement that
improper methods are permitted in
endorsing payroll vouchers and or­
ders, and leave nothing to indicate
that the right parties receive the
orders, according to the examiner.
Village officails are criticized ad­
versely for various practices and for
lack of proper accountings in some
departments, but few are named in
the report.
The largest single SP age item is
that of $4,838.4:5, repMUed against

Mi*. Spies' condition is still serious.
None of the doctors in attendance

Mr. Durant, in giving his side of
the shooting yesterday, said:
Was Pet Chicken.
"Th& chickea which was shot was a
tame one that bad b$en raised with
our turkeys. The* children fed it with
bread crumbs. When the automobile
went by she flew up, passing over the
road.
"The men were right in our door
yard. iMy wife called to them and
told them not to shoot. They paid
no attention to her. Then I got with­
in calling distance and I told them
not to shoot. They paid no attention

"When they went to get the chick­

took it and gave me the laugh. I
went to the house, got the gun and
ordered them to stop, so that I could
get the number.
"They speeded right on and I shot,
aiming at the tires. I had no inten­

CMCE OF WORK
The following, from the Breeders'
Gazette, is of interest because the
work was done under direction of the
Bismarck office, in charge of Dr. R.
H. Treacy, who is with the animal
husbandry department of the federal
government.
"A vigilant watch has been kept
in this country against dourine, the
most malignant venereal disease of
horses. Jt was introduced into this
country from Europe, but has fortu­
nately 'been kept from spreading ex­
tensively. It is hardest to control
in the range states, and there the
precautions are most necessary.
Testing is done by veterinarians by
the complement-fixation method and
the extent of their work is shown by
the figures for this year up to July
I. In iMontana the deputy state vet­
erinarians tested 507 head and gov­
ernment men 7,700 head, a total of
8,207 in the state. In North Dakota
the state men tested 481 and govern­
ment men 2,372, a total of 2,853. In
South Dakota the state veterinarians
tested 1,854 and the government men
11,486, a total of 13,339. This makes
a total of 24,399 horses in the three
states subjected to the test the first
six months of this year."

GET CLUE
OF
Laborer Declares He Saw Strange
Man, Apparently Wandering
on Farm.
DESCRIPTION TALLIES
WITH MR. WANNER
Jamestown, N. D., Sept. 9—Acting
on information that a strange man
was seen in the vicinity of the old
Joos farm, north of Jamestown, yes
terday afternoon sitting in a cluster
of weeds and later wandering toward
the west, this being followed by a re
port that a man whose actions were
peculiar was seen near the Attorney
Oscar J. Seiler farm, six miles north
resulted in five automobiles being sent
out from Jamestown this morning in
hope of finding Theodore Wanner, for
mer Fargo college professor, missing
from the home of his sister-in-law
here, since last Thursday morning.
Soon after the cook on the Seiler
farm, had reported seeing a peculiarly
acting man near there, searchers went
our from Jamestown last evening.
Darkness came on and the work had
to be abandohed until this morning. It
was a laborer for Pat Kelly, who now
operates the Joos farm, who brought
the first information to anxious rela
tives in Jamestown and who furnished
the only clue upon which brothers and
officers are bending every effort to lo
cate the missing professor. The de
scription which the laborer furnished
is said to tally with that given the
Jamestown police and the special ofii
cers of the Northern Pacific.
Discarding the theory that the pro
fessor might have wandered into the
James river and drowned, and work
ing on the only clue furnished—that
from the north—five automobiles con
taining relatives brothers and friends,
left Jamestown this morning for the
wooded country north of this city.
Late tonight no report had reached
the Wanner residence as to any fur­
ther thread of information which
might be picked up and followed.
E- G. Wanner, brother of the miss­
ing professor, piloted a party to the
north country this morning. Other
searchers to leave the city were Ralph
Pureed, manager of the Wanner Ab­
stract company of Jamestown James
Buchanan of Buclfanan. N. D., uncle
of Mrs. Fred M. Wanner of this city,
and long-time friend of the professor
Dr. Wanner of Wimbledon, and Ray
Sweetman of Fargo, who arrived this
morning and is a son-in-law of Mrs.
Wanner. Besides the relatives, P. W.
Eddy of the Eddy-Proctor Furniture
company, in his car with a party left
this morning for the woods.
The most plausible theory advanced
now is that over-study at the Univer­
sity of Wisconsin, at Madinson, where
Professor Wanner was taking post­
graduate work this summer, prepara­
tory to taking his chair at Wahpeton
Science school this fall, caused an un­
balanced mind. This theory is given
substantiation in a letter which was
received by members of the family
here, in which the professor is said
to have discussed certain topics at
random with no coherency, whatever.
In the letter, its was stated, that he
was in trouble.

London, Sept. 9.—British troops
have been engaged in the heaviest
kind of fighting along a three and one*
half mfile front, on the Somme, ex*
tending from High wood to Leuze
wood, and have captured Ginchy,
which lies almost directly north ot
Bomles, and all the ground between
Ginchy and Leuze. On a front ot
more than a quarter of a mile, the
British gained 300 yards, east of
High wood and northeast of Pozleres,
and captured 600 yards of German
trenches. In these engagements the
German casualties, according to the
British official statement, were er«
tremely heavy.
Likewise, the French, forcing the
attack in the Verdun sector, captured
a whole section of German trenches
east of Fleury, the assault being char­

a brilliant action.
Roumanians Fighting Strong.
Fighting on three fronts, the Row

ENGINEER ARRESTED ON
E ROBBEI
Jamestown, N. D„ Sept. 9.—John
Milley, for 20 years an engineer on
the Northern Pacific and for several
years on the Fargo local, was arrested
by Officer Hartman of LaMoure Thurs­
day, following the robbery of the.
Finch Lumber Yards company store
room. Milley waived examination be­
fore the police magistrate ot that city,
and was bound over to the LaMoure
term of district court on $500 ball
bonds.
"Stop, or I'll shoot you full of lead!"
was the ejaculation from Officer Hart
man as some one passed out of the
office of the lumber yard late that
night. The man only hastened his
flight. A shot was fired, then the
stranger gaspingly replied that lie
thought it was time to stop when a fel­
low started to shooting.
Hartman claims that Milley was the
first man he saw leaving the bulldlntf
and is responsible for the robbery.
JVIilley declares he is not guilty of the
theft and says he's a victim of circum­
stances. Several cans of paint were
found along the railroad track this
morning following the robbery.

Chicago, Sept. 9.—Daniel W. Law*
ler, Democratic candidate for United
States senator in Minnesota, brought
encouraging reports today of the po­
litical situation in his state to Sena*
tor Thomas J. Walsh, manager of the
Western Democratfc headquarters.
President Wilson is very strong ill
Minnesota and ,it is my opinion, he
will carry the state this fall," said
Mr. Lawler. "Since 1896, we hare had
ten state elections In Minnesota, and
at five of these the Democrats have
won. Congressman Van Dyke, Demo­
crat, of St. Paul, will be re-elected by
at least 10,000. Two Democratic mem­
bers of congress will be elected from
the Minneapolis district, and one ton*
the First, and one from the Sixth dls*
trict. We have a good fighting chance
to elect Democrats in two other con*
gressional districts. I also believe we
will elect T. P. Dwyer, of Minneapolis,
our candidate for governor."
