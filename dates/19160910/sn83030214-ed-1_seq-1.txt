It v.a? the battle-cruiser fleet that
engaged and held the enemy during
the battle of Jutland, and it was the
battle-cruiser fleet that I had an op
portunity of seeing, somewherc- in
the North.
On my way to it I passed the gray
Caatla of Edinburgh. A red-faced
old soldier was still telling a crowd
of tourists about the baby, "wrapped
in cloth of gold," which was diseov
ered a year or two ago in the wail
of Queen Mary's chamber. But
there were wounded soldiers quar
tered in one part of the caatlc now.
and a horny Scottish regiment, with
kilt and bonnet, preparing for tho
front in another part. The most
romantic of citics was all astir. with
history apain in the making, and
over the gray crosses, commemorat
ing old battles, the "bold bup'.os,
blowing points of war," rang from
the ancient heights and echoed all
down the Canonjrate, to die away in
the halls of Holyrood. All the color
rf a thousar.d years of war had
cime back like the life to the face
of a tranced aleapar, and addrd a
s'.gnificance and a glamour to the
new forms of power which I was
