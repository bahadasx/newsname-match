LONDON, September 9.?The
fall of Halicz, southeast of Lem
berg. in Galicia, appears immi-)
nent. according to unofficial dis
patches from Petrograd. The
Austrians are reported to be j
blowing up the forts in Halicz,
and the Russians are said to
have occupied some of them. It is
further unofficially reported
that the Russians on the left
bank of the Dniester are bom
barding the retreating Aus
trians.
According to reliable reports
that reached here tonight the
greater part of the garrison al
ready has retreated to the
northwest along the railroad
which runs to Lemberg.
Austrian Forts in Ruins.
VUe great ring of forts which hedged
in the Galician city is now a mass of
rr.oking ruins. Protruding into the
sv.ift current of the Dniester is a
tangled mass of wreckage that was the
big span linking together the north
and south sections ot the city. On the
left bank of the river the shell-torn
walls of the Halicz railroad station look
down on the ruins of cars and tracks
and other rolling stock.
The Russians are in possession of the
entire left bank of the stream opposite
the city. Their heavy guns are already
in position and are raking the whole
area with an unceasing fire. At some
places Gen. Letchi\sky's troops, accord
ing to the reports, have forced the
Dniester and have established themselves
amid the ruins of the forts which the
Austrians destroyed as they retired.
Preparations are going on with all
swiftness for the transport of strong
Russian forces to the right bank and
the subsequent occupation of the whole
city. Meanwhile, .as the Teutons fall
back from their last stronghold before
LernDerg they are being forced to aban
don most of the supplies saved from the
city.
May Cut Off Retreat.
Not content with capturing the fortress,
the Russian commander is trying to
execute a flank movement that will cut
off part of the retreating forces at a point
on the railroad several miles northwest
of the city.
The right wing of the combined army
of Pflanzer and Von Bothmer. bulwarked
by German and Turkish troops, has been
turned and thrust back from the Gnila
Lipa Just outside the city limits, and the
breach thus effected may permit Letch -
itsky to drive a wedge between the forces
retiring from Halicz and the main group.
On the Narayuvka the Russians appar
ently are forging ahead as fast as the
guns can be brought up. North of this
region the Teuton forces are presenting
stronger resistance, but the Russians'
success at Halicz will put at naught all
their efforts here and will compel them
to withdraw until the whole line of de
fense is straightened.
Puts Lemberg in Peril.
There is little doubt that the latest
stroke of the czar's commanders In
Galicia has paved th* way for the im
mediat* capture of Lemberg. Nowhere
ha ? the Teutons got as powerful a line
of deferis** as that which rested on Halicz.
From this point the Russian advance

Th? czar : forces continue to gain
ground in the wooded Carpathians,

Say That Greatly Increased
Cost Has Taken Away
Their Profits.
Whether or not Washington consum
ers of milk will have to pay an in
creased price for milk in the future
depends largely upon the settlement
which shall be reached by the bureau
of markets of the Department of Agri
culture, the Maryland and Virginia
Milk Producers' Association and pro
prietors of local dairies in conference
following a meeting of the producers
here yesterday..
Representatives of the 1,600 Mary
land and Virginia milk producers who
ship milk to the National Capital gath
ered at the Raleigh Hotel yesterday
to discuss the high cost of production
of milk and what they claim to be
the inadequate prices which they re
ceive from local dealers.
As a result of the conference, at
which more than 250 were present, a
committee was appointed to put the
matter up to local milkmen and t-o ask
the bureau of markets to join the
conference and help in a fair and
equitable settlement of the matter,
which overnight threatens probably to
raise the price of milk to local con
sumers.
Production Cost "has Increased.
The producers desire'a higher price
for their raw product on the ground
that the cost of production has in
creased so in recent months that they
cannot continue longer in the business
unless they get more money for their
milk.
A resolution "for the information,"
as it was phrased, of the committee
appointed by the producers* association
was adopted, giving it as the sense of
the meeting that the winter price of
milk should be not less than 24 cents
a gallon to the producers and the i
summer price should be not less than
20 cents a gallon.
The producers now get between 15
and 16 cents a gallon for their milk
during the spring, summer and fall. The
price paid for milk during the four
months of winter is approximately
22 cents a gallon. The producers
say they are making little profit at these j
rates, and that the cost of cattle feed is.
going up so that soon they will be pro- 1
ductng at a loss.
The committee appointed is as follows :
Westmoreland .Davis, Leesburg. Va?
chairman ; William H. CThambers, Barnes
ville, Md. ; F. E. Bowman, Remington,
Va. ; Judson V. Welliver, Rockville, Md. ;
McGill Belt. Dickerson, Md ; Frank S.
Walker. Woodberry Forest, Va.. and Her
man E. Gasch. Washington, D. C. This
committee was empowered by the con
vention to make an inquiry as to the
cost of distribution of milk, a reasonable
price which it ought to bring the pro
ducer in view of the increase in every
item of expense in production, according
to the claims of the producers, and was
empowered also to confer with the bu
reau of markets and with local milkmen
in order to get a harmonious and equi
table settlement of the whole matter.
Will Report September 23.
The committee will bring in its report
before a meeting of the association to be
called here September 23, when it is ex
pected that some final action will be tak- i
en, and it will be definitely known
whether or not Washington dairymen will
have to pay more for milk than at pres
ent.
The ultimate consumer, according to the
milk producers of Maryland and Virginia,
pays a rate of 9 or 10 cents a quart*
or 40 cents a gallon, for his bottled
milk, the whole year round, regardless
of the fact that the local dairymen pay
the milk producers the low "summer rate"
of 15 or 16 cents a gallon, eight months
out of the year.
With wheat at fancy prices, and cot
tonseed meal selling at $40 a ton, and
labor higher priced than ever, the milk
producers say that absolutely all their
profits are in danger of being wiped
out, and that It la practically a neces
sity for them to charge higher prices
per gallon for their product. They
claim unless the new scale of prices?
not less than 24 cents a gallon as the
winter price and not less than 20 cents
a gallon as the summer price?go into
effect in October, the great majority of
the 1,200 producers upon which Wash
ington depends for the milk which is
brought around to its doors in the wee
sma* hours will have to go out of busi
1 n ess.
More Profit in Hogs.
I It is possible to feed the milk to hogs,
| the producers say, and make more
j money selling pork chops than it is to
i sell milk at the present rate of 15 cents
a gallon Jn "summer" and 22 cents In
"winter." It has been a matter of com
mon talk recently among milk produc
| ers of Montgomery and other Maryland
I counties, it is declared, that it was
t largely discussed among them to give up
I their herds and go into the production
| of grain now selling at large prices,
i The meeting yesterday saw the dis
I appearance of the old District of Co
j lumbia, Maryland and Virginia Milk
? Producers* Association, which was re
I solved into the new association, the
| Maryland and Virginia Milk Producers'
I Association. Just how far the or
i ganization can go in actually fixing
I prices of its commodity was not exact
j ly known, so the committee was em
powered ?to investigate and consult
with the bureau of markets and with
the local retail sellers themselves in
order to get a harmonious settlement.

PEKING, September 9.?In addition to
demanding police power in South Man
churia and Inner? Mongolia as one of
the terms of the settlement of the in
cident at Chenchiatun, in eastern
Mongolia, Japan, it was learned In gov
ernment circles here today, also has
secretly suggested to China that the
employment of Japanese military ad
visers at the large Chinese centers and
of Japanese instructors in the Chinese
military schools would be highly de
sirable.
The Chinese press says the granting
of the Japanese demands would mean
the abandonment of Chinese sover
eignty in Inner Mongolia and in South
Manchuria.
China's Reply Delayed.
Ex-Premier Tang Shao-yi, who is to
become minister of foreign affairs, has
not yet arrived from Shanghai. He is
expected to reach the capital next week.
China's reply to the Japanese demands
probably will be postponed for his con
sideration.
China's dependency upon Japan for
money, it is maintained in semi-official
quarters, renders her unable to ignore
either the Japanese demands or sug
gestions unless financial assistance is
found elsewhere.
Wang Hung-nien, the Chinese com
missioner who was sent to investigate
the incident at Chengcjiiatun in
which several Japanese and Chinese
soldiers were killed in a clash between
troops of the two garrisons, has re

Official Report of Trouble.
The commissioner reports, officially,
that the trouble began through a street
fight between a Japanese civilian and
a Chinese soldier. Japanese soldiers at
tempted to fofce their way into the
Chinese barracks to arrest the soldier. |
A Japanese soldier, the commissioner
says, slashed the Chinese sentry with
! a sword, whereupon firing began, which
i resulted in the death of >six Japanese
and four Chinese soldiers.
Japan's New Demand on China
Threatens Open Door Policy,
Is the View of U. S. Officials
Japan's demands on China for the em
ployment of Japanese military advisers in
the large Chinese centers of south Man
churia and inner Mongolia and Japanese
military Instructors In Chinese schools
and colleges are viewed by officials here
as part of a new Japanese policy which
may threaten America's policies of the
open door and maintenance of Chinese
integrity.
For many years the Chinese govern
ment has employed some Japanese mili
tary instructors and advisers in Chinese
garrison towns, schools and colleges, but
she also has employed French, British.
Germans and a few Americans in the
same capacity. Always the choice has
been made according to her own judg
ment.
Negatives Clause in Treaties.
The new demands, restricting such ap
pointments to Japanese, would, many of
ficials believe, negative the "most favored
nation" clause in American and other
treaties and virtually convert a large sec
tion of Chinese territory into a Japanese
protectorate.
The State Department still is without
the complete information necessary for
determination of its policy in the matter,
but the opinion seems to be gaining
ground that the demands seriously affect
this country and that some sort of guar
antee should be had that "the most
favored nation" clause will not be an
nulled.

BY N. O. MESSENGEK.
AUGUSTA, Me., September 9.
?Now draws to a close the most
memorable campaign the state of
Maine has witnessed in the mem
ory of this generation, finishing
in a whirlwind of oratorical ef
fort and a blaze of fireworks and
I
the blare of bands.
As the ballots flutter in the boxes
next Monday they will tell the tale
of public sentiment in the first state to
express it toward the two great par
ties, and may, as they fall, indicate th?
direction the wind is expected to blow
in the great political storm next No
vember.
Barring surprises which may b?
sprung by the vast independent vote,
which is not disclosing in full its in
tentions to the managers of either
party, the indications appear to point
I to the republicans electing the gover
nor and state ticket, three of the four
. representatives in Congress, one United
: States senator fFernald) with the out
come of the other senatorship contest
so close as to gi-ve neither side abso
lute assurance of winning.
%
Johnson Is Running- Strong-.
If it is to be a republican land
slide Hale, the republican candidate
will also win. If the vote Is close,
even with the republicans winning by
a few thousand majority, Johnson, the
democrat may still be re-elected. This
situation arises from the fact that Mr.
Hale through personal disaffection is
not as strong as his party while
Senator Johnson will not lose the
vote of a democrat.
The one effort of the republican
speakers in the closing days has been
to induce progressives and disaffected
republicans to lay aside personal prej
udice and support Mr. Hale on nation
al grounds for the sake of the one vote
he would command in a close United
States Senate fi?jht. The agrument is
appealing strongly, especially as na
tional issues are raised by the presi
dential candidate, the vice presidential
candidate and more than a score of
some of the most prominent men in
the republican party at large. The one
congressional district whirh is believed
to be likely to be carried by the demo
crats is the Lewiston district, now rep
resented by McGillicuddy. democrat
Whichever way the ejection goes, it
will be futile for the leaders of either
party to try to claim that the result is
without national significance. The vot
ers in Maine understand that it is a
test of strength between democratic
and republican parties on national is
sues. The only discount to that propo
sition is 'in the case of the Johnson
Hale senatorial contest, wherein, as
stated, personality figures.
Assets of the Two Parties.
Casting up the assets of the demo
crats and the republican candidates,
the balance sheet would show about as
follows:
For the democrats: President Wil
son's popularity; the record of pro
pressive legislation hv the democratic
Congress; the support of Samuel Gom
pers and what portion of the labor vote
he can swing against the protective
tariff argument; that "the President
kept us out of war"; expected refusal
of a section of the bull moosers of 1912
to follow the leadership of Col. Roose
velt back into the republican party; a
businesslike state administration by
a business man governor who has piled
up a surplus in the state treasury of a
million and a half, and the support of
the "wets."
For the republicans: The basic fact
that normally there are more repub
licans in Maine than democrats; the ex
pected return of 90 per cent of the
bull moosers, whose vote in 1912 com
bined exceeded the democratic vote;
the tariff question in a state with
many industries and products at stake
the sectional issue raised over the al
leged discrimination against the north
by the preponderating Influence of the
south in the democratic Congress- the
support of the "drys."
The republicans think the Issue
raised by Mr. Hughes over the eight
hour wage law Is an asset. The demo
crats say the republicans are welcome
to it for their part, as it alienates labor
whereupon it is asserted that Mr
Gompers was fighting the republicans
anjhow, so it Is no additional loss
whereas it will bring the republicans
support from conservatives and inde
pendents. Figure it out yourself.
Active Campaign of Advertising-.
Referendum on a state law Axing a
fifty-four-hour labor week is to be
voted upon. It is supported by both
parties, but the' report has been spread
among the labor men that the oppo
nents of the law are most numerous
among republican employers. I
The democratic managers have made
an Active campaign of advertising In
the last hours. The democratic daily
press has been flooded with page and
half-page advertisements of an adroit and
appealing character.
The republican campaign methods
have been along very practical lines
however, mostly of an Individual and
personal nature. A small army of
workers In Individual canvassing has

I POLICY UNSUPPORTABLE
IN INTERNATIONAL LAW
State Department Investigating
English Firms' Access to Amer
ican Business Secret*.
RETALIATION LAST RESORT
No Radical Change Expected. But
Oradual Easing Up on Part of
Allies Looked for From
Legislation. ^
The recent statement by David
Lloyd George, the British secre
tary of war, during- a tariff debate
in parliament that trade informa
tion obtained from interrupted
neutral mail can be put by Great
Britain to "any public and na
tional use" has aroused the at
tention of the Washington gov
i ernment, it was learned last
1 night.
Any proof that Great Britain
is making use of such informa
tion in her struggle for commer
cial supremacy would probably
be followed, it was said last night,
, by vigorous steps here to bring
? about an alteration of any such
. policy.
Mr. Lloyd George's statement
! is regarded by officials here as
i opening the way for practices
' which might work inestimable
. injur? upon American business
interests.
Say Policy is Unsupportabl*.
While the State Department yester
day declined to make any comment on
| the subject pending a full investiga
tion of the exact meaning: of the War
Secretary's declaration, there were
many evidences that the policy he sug
, jested was viewed as unsupportable in
international law.
Discussion of the subject brought out
the suggestion that although the Phe
lan amendment denying use of Ameri
can mail, cable, telegraph and express
privileges to citizens of foreign coun
tries interfering with American mails
was stricken out of the retaliatory leg
islation recently passed by Congress,
the measure as enacted contains au
thorizations which might be construed
as broad enough to allow the President,
to retaliate against unfair use of the
censorship.
Many officials believe that if it can be
shown that British firms have an unfair
advantage over American firms because
of legislation passed as a result of in
formation gained illegally from, the
censorship, the President could forbid
importation to this country of the prod
ucts of whatever industries are affect
ed. As the disputed illegal use of the
censorship looked to the raising of a
tariff wall against neutral commerce,
and as this wall would be laid by indus
tries rather than by individual com
panies, American retaliation, it ia ar
gued. could be pushed as far as de
sired.
Retaliation as a Last Resort.
It has been well understood, however.
that the retaliatory powers were sought
from Congress by the executive branch
of the government for use only as a last
resort and in case diplomacy failed. Re
taliation will not be seriously contem
plated, it is believed, until a thorough
investigation of Lloyd George's purpose
has been made, and then only if there
are proofs that the trade information
actually is being put to the uses he
suggested. *
No surprise is felt here at the state
ment of Lord Robert Cecil. British
minister of trade, that "it is not likel>
that Great Britain will change her
blacklist policy at the request of th^
United States." Officials did not expect
enactment of the retaliatory legisla
tion to be met by any announcement
of concession by Great Britain, but
rather by a modification here and a
slight change there, till the whole
trade administration has been eased
up and softened to remove the most
threatening of America's objections.
