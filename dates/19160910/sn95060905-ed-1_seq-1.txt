DOUGLAS, Sept 9 Actual starva
tlon lb faced b) the people of the
southern part of the Sahuarlpa dls
trict of Sonora. As a result farms
and ranches which are fur ana) from
an food supplies are being deserted,
while the people are flocking to the
S P. de M. railroad In order that
the) ma) bae a chance to obtain
something to eat This was the
statement of a well known Americau
who recentl) returned from that sec
tion
The food shortage Is caused by the
extreme drouth which has afflicted
that section of Sonora during the last
two years. Almost no crops hate
been made On top of that. Villa's
forces in going through the country
en route to Chihuahua last winter
took nearl) all the fcod The Car
ranza forces which were pursuing
him and entered the district shortl)
afterward, completed the clean up
When they had commandeered all of
the food they could End the district
was almost as bare as though locusts
had swarmed over It.
This year there are good crops of
corn but at least a month must pass
before it will mature sufficiently for
ivoC. No lhe stock of an) kind Is
ieft.
Children, deprived of proper food,
are so emaciated that the) resemble
skeletons. They, as well as their el
ders, are almost without clothing in
most cases and in some entirely
naked except for rough breechclouts
Roots, cactUB fruit and other herbs
are supporting the people who re
main. -There is no bad feeling agaiisi
the Americans that I was able to un
cover" said that Informant. "The
Carranra government is growing tin
ceasingly unpopular. This is ch'Sy
fee to the monetary policy which hao
forced southern Sonora along with
the rest of the country to take the
worthless fiat money. All other kinds
have been demonetized by decree.
Anyone attempting to use gold, sli
ver of foreign money may be pun
Isbed If apprehended. In Guaymas.
Empalme and Hermoslllo I found
nothing but the fiat money of the
Carranze issue being used."
