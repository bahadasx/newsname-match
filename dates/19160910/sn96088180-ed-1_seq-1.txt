By Wm. P. SI turns.
Imperial Headquarters, Russian
Army, Sept. 9. Germany must send
four hundred thousand men to the
aid of the demoralised Austrtans, if
she hopes to stiffen their resistance,
General Michael AlQxlcff, chief of staff
of Csar Nicholas IPs armies, told the
United Press today.
Furthermore,' German troops must
provide the driving power if General
von 'Hindenburg attempts the great
eastern offensive talked about in Ber
lin. The Austro-Oormans can not
oocnt upon the Turks for substantial
aid, said thd man who directs the
movements of Russia's millions of
troops. The Turks can send no more
than 40,000 men to support their
Teutonic alllos.
Alexleff received me in 'a small,

Augusta, Maine, Sept. 9. The

binder is resounding - throughout
Maine today. Her rock ribbed foun
dations are staggering underneath
the weight of words spilled during
the laBt few weeks, for on Monday
Maine exercises her ancient prerog
ative of "point the way."
Forty-eight hours before the battle
of the ballots, it appeared from the
tone of voices on both side that
Maine would be registered partly in
the republican column. Judging from
predictions from both republican and
.democratic leaders, sifted down, the
'republicans are expecting a victory,
but not a complete one. The demo
crats are still claiming everything and
I the confident tone of the republican
leaders falters Just a trifle,
j Republican leaders today were
I unanimous In declaring that the pres
ence on the ballot of Nominee Charles

pencils lines, as if drawing rivers and
roads, sketching in arrows, showing
the direction of attacks.
j I asked him If he credited the re
port of an Austro-German-Turklsh'
combined offensive against Russia.
! "Despite, the encircling ring of the
allies and the continual pressure they
are exerting on all sides, I would
hesitate to say that such an offensive
Is Impossible," he replied. "The big
gest mistake a general can make is
to nnder-estlmate the enemy. Should
such an offensive develop, It will be
for us to beat It. This, I am most
confident, the Russian army can do.
"On July 16; the Germans started
a counter-offensive on the Llpa. It
failed. Future offensives stand to
meet the snme fate. I will not say
thnt the Austrian armies on our front
have boon crushed. They are, how

mans have filled In tho gaps with
twenty divisions, thus affecting
stiffening, but the Auntrlnns are still
disorganised. From the Turks not
more than two dlvlaions are available
for the Russian front, so If the com
bined offensive comes, the Germans

the following note concerning ths ar
rival of the seed in the Puget Sound
port:
"A new and important trade move
ment was noted during the month,
when a shipment of 6,000 sacks of
Russian beet seed was received on
Puget Sound by one of the big Japan
ese freighters through the well
known Importing house of Frank P.
Dow company. The shipment origin
ated at Kiev, sometimes spelled Kleft,
in the interior of Russia, and moved
over the trans-Siberian railroad to
Vladivostok, thence to Japan and
thence to Puget Sound, where It was

the start of hostilities were due to
lack of ammunition. We have the

"The Austrian are so badly shat

General Alexleff praised the work
done by the allies on the western
front.
"But what about pence ?" I asked
on leaving.
"Peace probably 1 some distance

Berlin, Sept. 9. German and Bul

than 50 mllea beyond the Roumanian
frontier In their operations along the
Black aoa coast, German war corres

.The German-Bulgarian advance
whloh carried the Roumantan ports

explains why the Roumanians, after
crossing the Transylvanian passes,'
now limit their operations to explor

correspondents reported. The Rou

Ing what the future will bring them.
