ONE CENT INCH
BYKMERS
Milk Producers Trying to Enlist
Support of Department of
Agriculture for Boost.
DEPENDS ON FLOUR MARKET
Bakers Ready for Six-Cent Loaf
Should Quotations Go Above
Present'Figure.
Six-cent bread within a week and
an increase of a cent a quart in
the price of milk in case the move
of the producers to force up the
wholesale price of milk is success
ful, are predictions made openly
today by well-known retailers in
this city.
The milk producers have gone
determinedly about the business
of establishing a higher price for
the dairy farms' output and are
planning to enlist the aid of Agri
cultural Department experts in
their fight. If they are successful,
Washington undoubtedly will pay
more for its milk.
.So far as the- price of bread is
concerned, the bakers are not yet
in entire agreement, but a rise in
the price of the ordinary loaf is de
clared to be absolutely certain.
PLAN IS ADMITTED.
Many bakers who have fought the
idea of a rise ,'n price today, tor the
flrat time, admitted that tho question Is
being considered, hut declined to give
A date upon which the Increase Is con
templated. A few assert that they will continue
to sell bread at 5 cents a loaf. Even
these said they mlKht be forced to an
Increase if the price of flour should
Jump.
"Bread probably will fro to 6
cents this week." was the prediction
of Otto Beuchert. "I believe many of
the bakers me simply waiting for some
one to start. Then all will fall In line.
"I was told yesterday by a flour man
that the price of good grades of Hour
would eo to MO within a week. If that
happens 1-ccnt bread is Inevitable. Hut
I think It would be only a matter of a
short time until It goes to 6 centa any
way, with flour above JS, aa It Is now.
for this means no profit, or a loss, on
5-cent bread."
Corby Predicts Rise.
Thouch he declined to predict a time,
W. 's. Corbv. of the Corby Baking
Co.. today said'
"I tfilnk bread Is bound to go up."
"Flour has been high, abnormally
high," Mr. Corby added, "but the price
of bread nai kept down because a de
crease in the price of wheat was ex
pected at harvest time. Instead of the
decrease this year we face an increase,
and even higher flour.
"I do not think many of the dealers
have a large supply on hand. This

for Washington at 9 o'clock tomor
row morning over the Richmond,
Fredericksburg and Potomac rail
road. "Prospects never were better,"
said Mrs. GUI today, discussing the
outlook. "Although I am supposed
not to be In on the matrimonial se
crets, I have it on good authority that
at least ten couples have arranged
to accompany us for the purpose of
being married In Washington. How
many others there are. I can't say,
but I would not be surprised If as
many more go with us with the same
purpose In view. You know, we are
having lovely moonlight nights, with
the flqest sort of weather, and that's
not a bad sign by any means.
"I have arranged to have thai Rev.

Ington, to meet us at the train and
fill the role of official celebrant at
the American House, which will be
our headquarters, nut that does not
mean that he wilt marry all the
couples. Home of them will doubtless
call on other ministers. At any rate,
r always give them the privilege of
doing so. If they prefer. I have
learned from long observation and
experience that It does not pay to
meddle with lovorn, even after It
has alt been fixed up. I always let
them paddle their own canoe, though
1 am ever ready to lend a guiding
hand If they want one. No. we
will not come back the same day.
We will remain until Wednesday,

JIFF OVER SOLDIERS
Preachers Criticise Dances by
"Y" Girls for Border Patrol
With Informal Introductions.
SAN ANTONIO. Sept. 10. Nice
soldiers, some with fraternity pins
and lisps, have caused the 'greatest
upheaval here probably since, the
Alamo.
The soldiers are Innocent. The fight
rages between tho V. W. C. A. and
the preachers primarily. The Y. W.
gave a dance to soldiers a week ago
and Y. W. girls and uniformed men
were introduced bv merely having
their names pinned to blouse and
bosom.
The preachers: "It was tho loosest
thing ever."
A special session of the ministerial
union was called for tomorrow to
condemn the V. W. AIL ministers
preached on the subject this morning.
Several churches are circulating peti
tions to have the Y. W. stop the
dances, which were to be weekly
affairs. .
People argue pro and con In car, on
streets, and some tight. And a little
secretary. Miss Ernestine Friedman, of
New York, Is the cause of it all.
She Is talking back to tho preachers
right pert and has an Immense following.
But the Y. W. board has ordered her to
give up the dances on Y. W. property.
Her chlnf defense Is that the soldiers
were nice Y. M. C. A. boys from the
bPHt families back home.
"We want men v.e can trust," jead
the appeal to captains for men. The
captains, knowing their men, plelunl
ones girls could trust anywhore. The
soldier guests now are writing Impas
sioned letters to newspapers declaring
the dance was perfectly all right.

CLERGYANDY.W.C.A
years ago and on (hat occasion assured
him that he was the greatest Chief Ex
ecutive of the country since Washing
ton. Mrs. Olll. who Is superintendent of the
Male Orphan Asylum In this city, for
whoso benefit her excursions are run,
wan asked how she happened ever to bo
gin operating these "Cupid Expresses,"
as they sometimes are called.
"Oh, It was many years ago." she ex
plained. "My first excursion was run
over the Chesapeake and Ohio to Old
Point nearly thirty years ago, while
Oen. Flu Lee was governor of Vir
ginia. Being a warm friend of mine, he
agreed to go as my special guest. The
trip wan so successful that I ran another
one tho next year, with equally good
success. A few years later, after I had
made good at the business, some one
asked me why I did not Invite bridal
couples to make my excursions a part
of their honeymoon.
Becomes "First Aid to Cupid."
" 'There's nothing half so sweet In
life as lovo'a young dream,' I said to
myself, taking on to the Idea Instantly,
and forthwith I resolved to come for
ward as first aid to Cupid, so to speak.
It then occurred to me that thereafter I
would run my excursions to Washing
ton, the Capital of the Nation. On my
first trip there three newly wedded
couples went along with us. Five other
couples aboard waited till we reached
our destination before they set sail.
"For a while It was an annual affair,
the trips being usually made In the
springtime, along toward Easter, when
the birds begin to sing and the young
man's fancy turns to thoughts of love.
1 believe I am quoting Tennyson, but 1
am not quite sure. In recent years. I
have been running two excursions one
In the spring and one In the fall. On our
trip tomorrow a. qno'l. tinny iz-hool
I'hiidieii will go along with us. In addi
tion to the usual quota. As school does
not open until Thursday, they will have
plenty of time to enjoy themselves be
fore buckling down to books."
Although she had kent no record. Mrs.
GUI estimates that at least 300 couples
have embarked on the marital seas as a
result of honeymoon specials.

voter today are ready for the "big

Following an unprecedented bombard

of the political parties, the way was

"The tidal wave of Republican ma
jority will start from Maine with fig
ures ranging on conservative estimates
from 18,000 to 30.000 majority. It will be
a clean sweep.
"These estimates are made by expert

How Democrats View It.
William G. Pattingall, Democratic
campaign manager. Issued a statement
In which he predicted a Democratic
plurality In Maine of 3.000.
"We certainly will re-elect Johnson,
which will be a victory for President
Wilson." he said. "Governor Curtis,
candidate for re-election, will receive
"1.000 votes, and I believe the State will
go Democratic by a plurality of 3.000.
"Roosevetls trip to Maine did not
change a vote, and Hughes' tour of
the State has had no apparent effect..
I believe the two Democratic candidates
for the Senate will be elected, and at
least one Congressman. The legislature
will be close. I believe that we will
control the House."
A governor, auditor, four Representa
tives, two Senators, a legislature, and
county officers will be chosen. Of the
present Maine delegation In the national
House three are Republican and one
Democrat. One United States Senator
Is Democratic and the other vacancy

In the proposed Increase In the price of

Declaring that an attempt by members
of the National Association of Master
Bakers to follow out "recommendation"
made by the executive committee of
that bodv to Increase the price of bread
will constitute a violation of the anti
trust law, Federal District Attorney
Charles F. Clyne satd tonight he will
start an Immediate probe If he finds
bakers are adopting the "recommenda
tions," "For the bakers to follow one an
other's lead In raising the price of bread
even without entering Into any specific
agreement about the price will consti
tute a violation of the Mitl-trust laws,"
said Clyne.
"Any such device as that proposed to
the master bakers yesterday that they
raise their prices 'voluntarily' after
some one In that community takes the
lead, Is as much a violation as a written
agreement to control price, providing
other facts concerning the high prtoes
of raw materials show manipulation."

SIXTY MILES FROM GOAL
General Sarrail Launches Ex
pedition From Salonlki
North Bulgars Checked.
LONDON, Sept. 10. Despite
the smashing blows' which the al
lies have been delivering success
fully against.the central powers on
every front for the last month,
military experts here all agree that
the really decisive campaign upon
which the eaYly end of the war de
pends is now under way in the
Balkans.
This great strategic move is a
double drive, aimed to cut the Berlin-Bagdad
railroad. Its effect if
successful would be to isolate Tur
key and Bulgaria from all com
munication with their allies! Ger- '
many and Austria, leaving them to
meet alone the combined strength
of the allied armies.
Germany also would lose the
supplies of grain and copper for
which she largely depends upon
her eastern allies.
STRIKE AT RAILWAY.
Already the Russians and Rou
manians, striking south at thla rail
road, have crossed tho Danube Into Ser
bia, after forcing the "Iron Gate." They
have advanced seven miles into Serbia,
capturing the town of Negotln. and
are now only sixty miles from their
goal, the railway.
, At the same time General Sarrafl Is
launching from the south, with Salonlki
for its base, an allied expedition which
will yiove north through Serbia against
the railroad.
Against these efforts Germany ap
parently can do little, as the relentless
pounding on the west front keeps all
her available reserves occupied.
Roumanians Make Gains.
Important Roumanian' successes on all
fronts are reported. In southeastern
Roumanla, in Transylvania and In
northeastern Serbia, which the Rou
manians are reported to have entered,
the Teutons and their allies) are re
treating. The Russians have turned the tide In
the Dobrudja, whero the Germans and
Bulgars began their invasion a few
days ago. Russians and Roumanians,
according to an official statement Is
sued at Bucharest, have driven the In
vaders out of Dobrlc (Basal djlk), fif
teen miles north of the Bulgarian bor
der in southeastern Roumanla. It Is
expected that the Teutons soon will be
driven from Tuthakan and other cap
tured Roumanian towns back to Bul
garia, whence they came.
In northern Transylvania the Rou
manians have taken Olah Toplltza and
five other towns from tho Austrlans.
This Is an advance of nearly thirty
miles into Transylvania, and another
step In tho Roumanian cnmpalgn to
squeexe the Austrlans out of tho whole
province.
Russians Unchecked.
The Austrlans made vain efforts to
stop the advance of tho Russians north
of Orsova, counter-nttacklng In force
near Mehadla, but were driven off
Hostile aeroplanes bombarded the Rou
manian Black Sea port of Constanxa,
wounding three civilians.
The recapture of Dobrlc by the Rou
manians shows the strength of the Rus
sian army that started south through
Roumanla as soon as Roumanla declared
war and ha now urrtved on the field In
the nick of time to turn the Teutonic In-
vslon Into a retreat.
Evidently this Russian army, de
scribed In Pctrograd dispatches as very
strong, already has forced a Teutonlo
retirement from many of the positions
taken In Roumanla and will force a re
Urement from other posts. .
Teutons Give Up Ports.
It Is certain that tho Germans and
Bulgars have had to give up the Black
sea ports of Kavnrna and Kal Akra,
which are north of BasardJIk. These
points are on the Teutonic right flank.
News that they have been forced out
of Aflatar. little more than ten ten
miles south of tho Roumanian fortress
of Slllstrla, Is expected at any time,
This driving back of the Teutonlo
right wing and center Is almost certain
to be followed by a withdrawal of the
left wing, which r.sta a llttlo north of
captured Tutrakan. Dobrlc. tho re
captured city. Is south of a line drawn
straight east from Tutrakan, and if
the Teutons In Tutrakan do not with
drw they will be caught with the Rus
sians and Roumanians In front of them
and the Danube and Roumanla behind.
