Discussion of Hie subject brought
out the suggestion that, although the
Phelan amendment denying use of
American mail, cable, telegraph and
express privileges to citizens of for
eign countries interfering with Amer
ican mails was stricken out of the re
taliatory legislation recently passed by
Congress. the measure as enacted con
tains authorizations which might b?
construed as broad enough to allow
i the President to retaliate against un
j fair use of the censorship. Many of
ficials believe that if it can he shown
; that P.ritish firms have an unfair ad
vantage over American firms because
of legislation passed as a result of in
formation gained illegally from the
censorship, the President could forbid
: importation to this country of the
products of whatever industries arc
| affected. As the disputed illegal use
! of tlie censorship looked to the rais
ing: of a tariff wall against neutral
commerce, and as this wall would ho
laid by industries rather than by in
I dividual companies, American retalia

! far as desired.

AS A I.AS'I" ItKSOHT
It lias been well understood, however,
that the retaliatory powers were
] sought from Congress by the executive
branch of the government for use only
| as a last resort, and in case diplomacy
failed. Retaliation will not lie se
riously contemplated, it is believed,
until a thorough investigation of l.loyd
(ieorite's purpose has been made, and
then only if there are proofs that the
trade information actually is being put
to the uses ho suggested.
No surprise was felt here to-day at
the statement of\Lord Robert t'ecil,
British Minister of Trade, that "it is
not likely that t >reat Britain will
change her black-list policy at the
request of the I'nited States." t ?f
J ticials diil not expect enactment of the
retaliatory legislation to be met by
any announcement of concession by

cation here and a slight change there,

pan's demands on China for tiic etu
ployment of Japanese military advisers
in the large Chinese centors of South
.Manchuria and Inner Mongolia, and
Japanese military instructors in Chi
nese schools and colleges are viewed
h\- officials here as part of a new Jap
anese policy which may threaten Amer
ica s policies of the open door and the
maintenance of Chinese integrity.
For many years the Chinese govern
ment litis employed some Japanese mil
itary Instructors and advisers in Chi
nese garrison towns, schools and col
leges, hut she also has employed
French, Hritish. Herman and a few
Americans in tlte same capacity. Al
ways the choice has been made accord
ing to her own judgment. The new
demands, restricting such appoint incuts
to Japanese, would, many ollicials be
lieve, negative the "most favored na
tion" clause in American and other
treaties, ami virtually convert a large
section of Chinese territory into a
Japatl. se protect orate.
The State Department still is with
out the complete information neces
sary for determination of its policy in
the matter, hut the opinion seems fo
be gaining ground that the demands
seriously affect this country, and that
some sort of guarantee should be had
that "the most favored nation" clause
will not be annulled.
