SOUTH AMERICAN REPUBLIC AT WAR WITH GERMANY
ARMY IN
FRANCE!
Tiny Neighbor of
Brazil, Led By
President, Now
With Allies
THK FLAG OF COUNANI.
WASHINGTON. 0. C, Jan. 2!).
—An American republic has de
clared war on Germany?
its president and its army are
fighting ln France!
This astounding, information
has Just been received ln Wash
ington, although the declaration
of war was Issued in September,
1114, and many of the repub
lic's soldiers are already dead
on the Held of battle.
Coiiiiiini; Kver Hear of It?
The republic is Counani, and
it Is a real republic, on the bor
der between Brazil and the
French section of Guiana, about
15 miles back from the sea.
Its Independence dates from
1886, when title to the country
was officially relinquished by
the republic of Brazil.
The Counriiitr.il>-. then expected
to be annexed to French Guiana,
but France wouldn't annex them,
so they elected a president—and
Counani has been Independent
ever since.
Sends Army of 300.
• The present president is
Adolph Bresaet Beaufort, a
French colonel banished to
Guiana many years ago for a po
litical crime. When war broke
out. Beaufort announced he was
going back to fight for France.
"We'll go, too," said the Cou
nanian army.
And they did.
'Twas a motley army of 300
that sailed for France under the
blood-red flag wtlh the great sil
ver star —emblem of Counani.
But they participated with hon
or in the famous charge of the
foreign legion at Bols Sabot.

When Reynolds was ap

more than a year ago
he threw a surprise Into
some of the special inter

the jump.
For he proved himself to
be one of the first men ln
the history of that commis

of the public first and last.
I
Service That Serves
Up to that time tho body
of men crrlled the "public
service" commission had
been used as a bumper for
the corporations, a clearing
house of special privilege.
He made It a public service
commission.
For Instance he issued an
order to his engineers which
ran something like this:
"The corporations will get
what's coming to them—no
more and no leas. If you
are out to allow them any
advantages or privileges you
lose your job. And If you
take a cent from them which
Is rightfully theirs, you will
bo fired."
The engineers have acted
accordingly.
A hlg corporation suj-h It

property It can't find. Rey

out ou n hot search to find
it. They will not he satis

located it or have determin

■freeze May Wreck
Green River System
A jam of ice, pounding against the intake end of the 26-mile Green river pipe line, is hourly threat
ening to plug up the pipe and cause a vacuum that would force the huge tube to collapse.
A similar accident occurred to the Seattle water system at Cedar river during the present cold
spell, and shut the city completely off from water for several days.
City workmen at the little mountainside station where Tacoma taps its water supply from the
Green river, are frantically fighting the ice demon that threatens the Tacoma system. Assistant Water
Supt. Kunigk will hurry to the intake station tonight with a quantity of dynamite, to blast away the
rapidly forming ice and attempt to clear the channel. •
Green river is frozen worse than at any former time in 22 years. There is now six inches of ice, and
the thickness is increasing daily. Below zero weather has prevailed continuously, with blizzards of slush
and snow every few days since Jan. 1, and bitterly cold winds have blown every night.
S^ish ice, rather than cake
ice, ;is the menace. This is
caused by slush plunging against
the l«-rr "tied opening at the upper
end of the long pipe, freezing in
stant 1... and threatening to spread
over the entire pipe. Several
crews of workmen, . armed will)
picks and axea, have worked con
stantly day and night during the
last two days' hacking away the
ice aa tupldly as It formed.
City Workmen Heroes.
These men, although unknown
to the people of Tacoma. who they
are '.working for, are heroes ln
disguise.
Tley have heen subjected to a
most bitter onslaught of the ele
ments. At tines their clothing,
saturated with ley spray, has fro
zen solid.
They have faced a 75-mlle
bllsjqard with the mercury below
zero, The Intake, where the dan
ger Jies, is in an exposed place,
and {here is no chance tor shelter.
So long as the pipe end is kept
opeif, there is no danger to the
city, according to Stipt. Kunlgk.
But the minute tbe slush ice
gain* In Its fight With the city
workmen, Tacoma" will be shut off
from water, and, under present
weather conditions, it may take
an Indefinite time to make re
paint.
• Would Mean Collapse.
TJse Green river pipeline Is
equipped at frequent intervals
with air-valves, which allow air
to pAss slowly Into tbe pipe when
ever the tube Is being drained.
But the valves are so small, that
under normal conditions 'a shut
off of water must take place dur
ing a period of at least eight
houi-B.
Should ii- c pack against the In

seconding to Supt. Kunlgk, the

and large sections of the pine
would collapse.
Admits Peril is Great.
I do not believe that Tacoma
need feel badly worried over the
situation," said Kunlgk today.
"We have never faced such a
danger before, because the river
has never frozen anything like
it is now. 1 believe that we can
as* dynamite effectively to clear
the river of tot at the intake and

cannot last much longer.
"We have learned a lesson from
Seattle's calamity, and I feel con
fident that the city will be able
to prevent a break in the line.
Nevertheless, the danger exists,
and it is a very grave one."
