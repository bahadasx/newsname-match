into the market square. On a mar

dealers and bargaining citizens; but

ground. They were uniformed and
completely equipped, each carrying
his rifle and even the skin-covered
knapsack and little wooden canteen.
Thenext moment soldiers were
striding into the square from all di

filled with silent, attentive and. per
fectly ordered companies, with of
