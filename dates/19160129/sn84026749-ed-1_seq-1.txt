BRANDEIS WILL
BE CONFIRMED;
BITTER FIGHT
Senators Expeoted to Swing in
Line for Appointment, But
No. Action May Be Taken for
Long Time.
Choice Meets With Most Ap-
proval From Radical and
Progressive Members; Con
servatives Are Hostile.
Although the Senate is seething
today over the appointment ot
Louis D. Brandcis as associate
justice of the Supreme Court, and
Senators in private are voicing all
manner of sentiments and emo
tions, the opinion is gaining
ground that Mr. Brandeis will in
due time be confirmed.
That ho will not be confirmed
without a long and bitter fight
seems' certain. The fight, so Sen
atore say, will, in large part, be
based on the beltef that Mr.
Brandeis is too much of a radical
and too much inclined to social
ism to be a safe man to put on the
supreme bench'. ..Conservative
'Senators of both the Democratic
and Republican i rt parties are show
ing hostility to the appointment.
FAVOR CHOICE..
Aa a general proposition, the radical,
naa progressive nvmbcri of the Senate
are going, tq -support the appointment. It

The members of the Senate, on the
whole, who are said to be best pleased,
are the progressive Republicans.
Although In some quarters what pur
port to be polls of the Senate on the
question are being put out. manv Sena
tors refuse to say how they will vote.
They say they, are coins to aprroach
the subject with an open mind and de

But the reasons for bellevinsr Mr.
Brandcis will be confirmed aro based on
thepoltlcs of 'the situation. In the first

WITH LEGISLATORS
Bills Affectjng Capital Discussed
Behind Closed doors at Cap
itol Today.
Commissioners Nowman, Brownlow,
and Kutz held a lengthy conference to
day with tho subcommittee on the Ju
diciary of the House District Committee
regarding the various legislative mat
ters contained In tho Commissioners'
estimates.
Following the Introduction of the Com
missioners' bill by Congressman Ben
Johnson a number of theso measures
were referred to the District subcom
mittee headed by Congressman Vinson
of Georgia.
By appointment the subcommittee
met tho Commissioners in executive
tension today and took up the truo
consideration bill, the measuro for
the control by the Commissioners of
the Aqueduct Bridge, proposed legis
lation for a garbage disposal plant,
Hnd bills vesting tho Commissioners
with authority to appoint the record
er of dot ds and the register of wills.
These bills were taken up one by one
end the commissioners probably will be
engaged most of the afternoon in ex
plaining the necessity for the legisla
tion. Although the conference was be
hind closed doors it is understood that
members of the sub-committee appeared
to be in sympathy with the several pro
posals under consideration and It is
probable the bills will be reported.
Practically no doubt exists as to
the prompt report of the bill author
ising the Commissioners to name the
recorder of deeds and the register of
wills. It la understood at the Cap
itol that President Wilson desires to
bo relieved of the task of making
these appointments. If the House
District Committee votes favorably
on the legislation Its passage will be
expedited by putting the bills as
riders upo nthe District appropria
tion measure soon to be reported
from the Appropriations Committee.
The bill requiring tho statement of
true consideration In all deeds Is also
favored at tho Capitol, and this may
po as a rider on the District hudpet.
The Commissioners' request for jurisdic
tion over tho Aoucduct bridge, now
controlled in part by the War Deoart
ment and the Commissioners, doubtless
will receive the sanction of tho sub
committee. ... ,
What disposition will be made of the
garbage disposal measure depends large
ly upon the economy program of the
Appropriations Committee. While there
Is general sentiment in support of such
a plan, it is possible that It may not be
authorized at this session because of tho
Democratic pruning knife.

Throughout the city today provisions
of (his bill were discussed, and it

calling at his office to Hnd out more
about the provisions of the measure
were referred to the bill, which Is
sixty pages long, and one of the most
lengthy Introduced during the pres
ent session.
Referred To Committee.
The bill was referred to the House
District Committee, and public hear-1
Ings probably will be held on It before
It Is reported.
The bill calls for a commission of
threo members, each receiving an an
nual salary of J3.000, and devoting his
entire time to tho work. It provides
that the commission assume responsi

TAItlS, Jan. a. Fear 'that the allies
arei about to launch another great of
fensive to capture Lens and break the
German lines has inspired furious Ger
man attacks In the Artoia region, ac
cording to prisoners taken by the
French near La Tolie.
Bavarians under Crown Prince Rup
precht are smashing hard at the British
line northeast of Loos. They are at
tempting to break the salient conquered

The news caused great excitement

It was the first land action In which
armed forces of all the four allied pow
ers have participated since the begin

Tho fort Is located on the peninsula

The landing was made. It was stat

For by War Experts
PETROGRAD, Jan. 29. Early re

cast by Russian military critics. Their
expectation is based In part on the un
usual activity of German aircraft In
reconnolterlng the Russian lines.
Not only aeroplanes but Zeppelins
are being employed.
This activity. In connection with In
formation obtained frpm prisoners cap
tured in Bukowlna concerning removal
of German troops from that region,
leads to the belief that the 'Germans
may be preparing an offensive In the
north for the purpose of countering the

U. S. RELATIONS
WITH GERMANY
NEAR A BREAK
OVERLUSITANIA
High Official Declares Situation
Now Is Graver Than It Has
Been and That Country
Should Know It.
Berlin's Failure to Meet De
mands of United States for
Settlement Responsible for
the Crisis.
Diplomatic relations between
the United States and Germany
are near the breaking poffrt
"The situation," declared a hlgi,
official of the Government today,
"is graver now than it has been
for some time and the country
ought to know It.1'
Failure on the part of Germany
to meet the demands of the United
States for a settlement of the
Lusitania case is responsible for
the present crisis.
Germany still refuses to disa
vow as illegal asubmarine Attack
without warning on a vessel laden
with helpless men, women and
Hildren. "
DEMANDS . ACCENTING: .
The imperlalKovernment does not ad
mit that the 'slaughter of the 100 Ameri
can mert, women, and children, who
were slain from ambush, was wrong.
On a basis of technicalities, the Berlin
authorities still would shift legal re
sponsibility for the act of the German
submarine commander. England's re
prisals Germany would still blame ror
the attack on non-combatants, and upon
the shoulders of tho babies whose
maimed bodies were strewn in the wake
of the sunken liner Germany would
partly lay the guilt.
After months and months of "con
versations" and exchanges. Count von
Bernstorff, German ambassador to tho
United Btatcs, sUll seeks to salve the
State Department with "expressions or
regret." while Secretary of State Lan
sing demands a stricter accounting
an open and above-board disavowal,
and reparation based on an admission
of liability, not In tho way of charity.
That Is the situation as it stands to
day, and as it stood last Thursday night
when President Wilson, appealing tor
support of his national defense pro
gram, solemnly warned the country that
he could not predict "what the Inter
national relations of the United States
would bo tomorrow."
For once. If never before In the
controversy. Count von Bernstorff
knows that the United Stntes means
business. He has Informed his gov
ernment that the time for empty
phrases is past, and he has forward
ed to Berlin a copy of the President's
speech to Impress upon the German
foreign office that the United States
Government, after all, is not "too
proud to fight." ,
Nor Time Limit Fixeo".
The ambassador expects to hear
from 1ls government by next Friday,
although as yet the United States
has placed no time limit on the nego
tiations. On that same day the Presl-
'dent will return to Washington from
