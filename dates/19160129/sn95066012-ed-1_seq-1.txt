Insofar as a practically fireproof
building is concerned, Bennington has
made an excellent . investment In the
new town home which has now been
completed and occupied by the town
poor since August. The' . 'tax-payers.
, have a building on the hill north (ot
. the village which may well serve as a
pattern, for other communities who
must deal with the problem of those
who through misfortune or disability
are unable to care for themselves,
even though the cost has been great
er than was anticipated. The genial
and efficient superintendent, Arthur
AV, Russell, took a member of the
Banner staff through the institution
Thursday afternoon and the impress
ion gained was that the tax-payers
had been compensated for the ex
pense to which the community had
been put in replacing the town house
burned, several months ago.
The building - faces east and
i comprises s the main center sec

COMPLETED
a slight elevation, a short walk from
Hicks corners. It was begun in Oc-
toV. 1914 and finished the following
A'j,' -t from plans furnished toy Archi
teef Bull. It was built by day
labor u:! yMr. Bull's direction and
the struct u.'w stands practically
completed exec., r some interior
furnishing and pu 'Mg. The appro
priation for the builumg was 118,000,
but subsequent improvements and
furnishings will bring the total cost
nearly to $30,000.
The exact cost figures for the plant
are not iyet available. They will be
compiled at the forthcoming town
audit but estimates of additional ex
penditures above the original appro
priation are somewhat as follows
Furniture, 2000; Heating system,
$1000; water pumping and storage
system, $500; electric wiring, $300;
architects fees for both plans and su
pervision, about $1000. Additional
and unavoidable expense was also in
curred in the grading of the. grounds,
small carpentry work, etc., which had
to be added to the building expense,
'In spite of this, the visitor will
agree after a careful inspection of the
institution, that the town has receiv
ed its money s worth. In the first
place the building is practically fire
proof. Walls, floors and ceilings are
entirely of tile and concrete. The on
ly wood in the building is the window
and door casings and stairs into the
cellar.1 A bonfire could ibe lighted in
the basement with no more serious
effects than smoking up the walls and
girders. Supt Russell assured the
Banner man, however, that he was
not going to experiment to find out.
The first impression created by the
building is its substantial construc
tion without losing its artistic lines.
It is about 40 feet wide by 150 feet in
length, of two stories, with porte
cochere in front and sun parlors com
pleting the ends of the wings. Steel
girders 'bear the weight of the build
ing with foundation walls of stone.
Supt. Russell and family, together
with such hired help as aid in carry
ing on the Institution, occupy the mid
dle section which has been furnished
in mission. The floors, which are of
concrete, with curved, dust-proof cor
ners, will eventually be tinted. The
walls throughout have already been
tinted in ecru. .
The women's section comprises the
south end of the building. There is a
largo dining room and sitting room on
the; main floori' the individual , rooms
being on tho second story! The whole
structure contains 29 rooms, but the
entire home will accommodate: about
60 .inmates. Th6 home has 16 in
mates at present'""" '"'
Each room in both men and women's
section is provided with ' an ample
White iron cot bed. aimllinr tn thno
used " hospita wards. There is also
a. dresser, table "and chair. The oc
cupants of the home trim their rooms
to suit their individual tastes and
some of them care for their own
quarters. This is not compulsory.
however.
The men occupy the north , wing,
which is a duplicate of the other in
lay-out. The whole building is electric-lighted
and steam heated and is
kept in spotless condition by Mrs.
Russell and her assistant. The kit
chen and other domestic departments
would be the envy of many a house
wife for the first consideration of the
architect has been ample room and
convenience. The- kitchen is at the
rear, of the ground floor, a room thirty
-...
met .square, wun a pantry as large as
many an ordinary house kitchen. Di
rectly beneath is the laundry with suf
ficient space to hang the entire
washing indoors if necessary.
Two Interesting features in the base
ment are the heating equipment and
the apparatus for the water supply.
The heat is supplied by an Aird Don
boiler, which has only burned 15 tons
of coal thus far this winter. In the
west basement the visitor is puzzled
by a gigantic cement reservoir which
fills the wliole cellar, about 15 feet
wide, twenty-five feet long and six
feet in height. This ' tank receives
and stores all the rain water from the
roof and in addition three large in
verted boilers are supplied by both
hard and soft water pumped from the
farm spring about half a mile away.
By the ingenuoujj contrivance, operat
ed by motor, tkftthrowing of a lever
on the pump switches the water sup
ply from the Rrd to soft water and
automatically keeps the water system
up to capacity. In case of fire any
where on the 'premises the force of
water generated would throw a
stream two hundred feet. Thus, even

FOUR HMOUS
SHOOTINGS III
ALBANY
Victims Neither Saw Assailant
Or Heard Report Of Weapon
ALL FOUR SHOT IN THE BACK
Two Men and a Woman in Hospital
With But Little Hopes of Their
Recovery.
Albany, Jan. 29. Four persons, a
woman and three meu, were shot In
the streets of Albany yesterday by a
mad man and it Is feared that two of
the maniac's victims will die.
Tho mysterious 'gunman, .who was
armed with a revolver of small call
tore, escaped. None of the four vic
tims of the shooting were.', able' to
identify their assailant and the police
are entirely at sea In their search for
tho madman,
All four of the victims, Mrs. John A.
JIcKeon, 70; James Edwin, 60, and
James McCormack, 20 and Edward
Kinney were shot in the back. Mrs
McKeon and McCormack were shot
through the lung and their conditions
are serious. Etwin is in poor health
and the hospital authorities have but
little hope that ho will recover.
The first shooting occurred shortly
after 4 o'clock and the fourth about
two hours later.
" McConnaok Is the only one of the
four victims who had an opportunity
to observe the personal appearance of
the madman.
A strange feature of the ' case is
that not one of the four Tvounded pa
sons; heard the report of the woajion
when It was discharged.
WEATHER FORECAST

Vermont increase in- cloudiness and

should the farm spring go dry, the
basement mechanism provides pure
filtered water from the storage of
rainwater in the reservoir, . .
The management of such an institu
tion will always be of interest for the
handling of those placed in its care is
a business different than any other
executive line. Mr. Russell seems to
be the man for the Job. It requires
tact, resource, diplomacy and an end
less reservoir of patience for the day
of using drastic measures and taking
advantage of the helpless condition
of the inmates to secure order and
enforce discipline, has gone. In this
regard, Bennington's town home con
tains an atmosphere more like a sanl-
torlum than an Alsatia for those un
able to provide for themselves. ' Most
of the inmates are too ' disabled or
feeble to do an?- manual labor and
the time is spent in reading, writing,
walking about the grounds and games
between themselves. Twice a week
they are' permitted to come into the
village if they are able; on the proviso
that! they return at a specified ' hour.
Mr, jRussell's principle of treating the
town's poor with a regard for their
feelings, insofar as reasonable disci
pline permits, and allowing them the
free use of their specified parts of tho
house and the grounds, minimizes the
old-time stigma of being confined in a
charitable institution. Many of the
patients are in ill-health and an end
less amount of care is imposed on the
superintendent awl his wife in pro
viding for their requisites. The man
ner in which they greet him on his
appearance among them, speaks well
for his popularity with them, and the
appearance of the house and grounds
shows that he Is also a good caretak
er as well as guardian of the inmates.
Under the extreme east wing of the
building is a vegetable cellar which is'
annually stocked with produce grown
on the farm. Twelve head of cattle
are housed in a barn across the road
and butter and cream is sold in the
summer that is not consumed by the
institution.
On the whole, Bennington has rea
son to bo proud of the manner in
which she cares for her poor, and
while some may grumble at the ex
pense Incurred in erecting and equip
ping the building, nevertheless the
town has something permanent and
creditable to show for its money. Af
ter the furnishing of the rooms Is com
plete the town need not be ashamed
to put tho institution on the sight
seers itinerary as one of the most
modern and model homes of its kind
in New England. ,
HEADS FREE LOAN SOCIETY
J. Dukas Who Has Business Interests
' In Bennington.
At the 24th annual meeting of the
tNew York Hebrew Free Loan Society
Incorporated, held Sunday afternoon
at the organization's headquarters at
108 Second AveenueJ President Julius
J. Dukas who has business interests
here in Benningtonj announced that
during 1915 the society had broken all
previous records in making free loans
A total of $070,50B war loaned during
the year. The previous record was
made by the society during 1914
when $055,140 was loaned without in
terest. The president further an
nounced that tho society would ex
tend its scope this year to include
Brooklyn.
Jacob H. Schiff and Adolph Iewis
ohn both spoke at the annual meeting.
and Mr. Schiff, In commenting upon
the extension of the society's actlvlt
les to Brooklyn, broached the subject
of ignoring borough boundary lines as
far. as charitable organizations, were
concerned. iCoutroller Piendergast
was another speaker and heartily sec
ended this suggestion. He said ho
wlehed -Mr. Schiff would take the load
In a movement to carry it .Into effect.
' "I am. intensely interested in the
society's work, in its constructive feat
ure.V'Mr, Schiff said. " Yours is not
a charity society. It is a business
concern with an altrulstio basis, a con
cern that builds up existences. The
fact that your loans are made prlncl
pally with the character instead of
tho collateral of the indorsers as se
curity speaks volumes for the integri
ty of the great mass of people with
whom you do business; and the fact
that it' has been necessary to collect
only 2 per cent, of your loans from
the indorsers instead of the principals
speaks volumes for the character of
the people whom you aid and for the
honesty of your community."
Ia his annual report President Dak-
as had referred tr the effect of the
war on the work of the society. He,
said the war was the direct cause of
a great demand for loans, but that,
with the revival of industry in this
country, demands upon the society
had assumed a more normal tone. Mr.
Schiff commented on this feature. He
said that "prosperity,' because of the
suffering caused elsewhere by the
war was a misoraer tor the condition
brought about in tliis country as a re
sult of the war. In lighter vein he
suggested that, at their present rate
of pauperizing themselves, the Euro
pean Governments might soon -be ap
plying to the Hebrew Free Loan So
ciety for aid.
"In that event,", he aid, "I would
caution you to investigate all . re
quests very carefully."-..; .
Ad61ph Lewlscha spoke ibrlefiy, and
also referred to including - Brooklyn
in charity organization work. -f ' ;
Both Mr. Lewisohn and Mr. Schiff
have been liberal contributors to the
Free Loan Society and when Mr.
Lewisohn finished speaking it was an
nounced that he hud just offered to
give $1,00Q more to the society for
every 1,000 new members that it en
rolled. It already has 7,490 members
of whom 1,802 were enrolled during
the last year. Mr. Schiff recently con
tributed $1,500 toward the expense of
opening the Brownsville branch.
Regarding the work cf the. Froo
Loan Society Mr. Lewisohn was en
thusiastic. "It has enabled a groat many to got
on their -feet without the loss of their
self-respect." lie said, "and it Is only
fair and right that the public should
help to carry out the work on a larg
er scalo than ever before in the years
to come." , ' .!!
lii his annual address Prosident
Dukas said that losses during the last
year, although it was a very ., trying
year, had been no greater than dur
ing the previous year. They amount
ed to $4,588.50 or about five-eighths of
1 per cent, of the total amount loan
ed during the year.
"For twenty-four ijears we have sue
cessfully shown the world that most
people are honest and repay their
loans, if a proper chance is given
them." Mr. Dukas said. "Our statis
tics continue to show that over 97 per
cent, of our loans are repaid by tho
borrowers themselves, and less than
2 per cent . by . the indorsers. This
speaks well when we consider that
over 75 per cent of our indorsers have
no commercial rating."
Mr. Dukas said, that the society's
loanable capital had been used live
times during the year, and that, as
the capital increased, the . society's
field of work would be almost un
limited. Mr. Prendergast congratulated the
society and its officers. He also
caused laughter by suggesting that a
number of public benefactors organize
another such society, with the muni
cipal Government as sole beneficiary
and lend money to the city without In
terest. The annual report of the Bociety
contained a list of the trades of bor
rowers, i Peddlers led the list, there
having been 2,995 loans to this class.
Housewives ran a close second with
2,700 loans. Seven borrowers were
actors, and six artists.

ing- the year 1915' made a' gain in pop
ulation of just two, there having been
145 deaths and 147 births during the
12 months ending on! December 31
last Of the deaths - reported, how-
over, 23 were of veterans at the: Ver

suffering for three weeks with Chro

failed. Fortunately I heard of

three or four days am up and welL
I am employed at the biggest depart
