ALLEGED CRUELTY OF
' GERMAN PRISONERS OF WAR.
1 British Government Makes an Unqual
ified Denial of the Charges. . .:
1 London,' Jan. 28, 11.0-5 p. ' m. The
foreign office tonight made public a
note from - the German foreign office,
,. transmitted through James W. Gerard,
the American ambassador to Germany,
relating to alleged cruelty by French
uid English troops toward German
prisoners. The British government
makes - unqualified denial of - the
charges. .
- The note requests the "Washington
government' to ' transmit a protest
against "this violation of international
law", to both the British and French
; governments.: The instances of alleged
cruelty cited are;
"First During-the battle at Oulse-
Jongeux, Aug. 30, 1914,,. jfrench officer
ordered a -severely wounded officer to
be placed on the rampart of a French
trench under, the fire of v the German
, artillery, with the object of having him
killed by German bullets.
- r "Second On Jan. 13, HIS, tri the
neighborhood of - Soissona, French
troops placed the- ' captured German
t soldiers . on the ramparts of . their

and compelled them thus to pass many

MYSTERY OF 'ABSENCE -
' . OF STEAMER APPAM.
Shipping Experts Believe She Sank
v ' " About the 16th of January. -
' I II ':
London, Jan. 29. The myetery of the
tsntisn ana Aincan steam navigation
company's liner Appam takes first
place in the news, of . the . mpming
newspapers today, and they all agree
that the prospect that she will ever
come into port may now be regarded
.as iopeiera, -.-..-. .
Shipping experts believe the steamer
' sank about the 16th of January north
west of Madeira. - From the prevailing
winds it is figured that the catastrophe
occurred some distance north of where
the lifeboat was found. At the Xon
don office of the Elder Dempster line,
agents of the steamer, the belief was
expressed ; that the ; total loss .of life
would aggregate 301 87 first class and
81 second class passengers : and 123
.members of the crew. .
'Most of the passengers were English
and resident in London, while a ma
jority at the crew were natives or lav
erpool. Captain Harrison of -the
steamer was one of the oldest and
most reliable officers in the company's
service.
Speculation regarding- the oauBe of
tne catastrophe varies from a subma
rine attack to an internal explosion.
The value of the liner and her cargo
. is estimated at fully Sl.50v.O00.
A very 1-igh rate of reinsurance la
being q wcl on the steamers Ariadne
M&NCE
and Clan MacTavish which are over
due on voyages over the same route as
the Appam took. '
Shipping men say. there is little like
lihood that the Appam could have sue.
cumbed to a etorm without ' notifying
the world with her wireless, which was
01 tne latest type.

As to who pays the cost of advertising' there are many illustra
tions, but only one answer. Take the case of a certain auto manu
facturer who a tew years ago was manufacturing a few thousand cars.
His cars were sold for a thousand dollars apiece. Since then he has
gone into the business much more extensively and at the same time he
has more than cut the rice of his cars in two. this reduction being
made possible by . the Increased volume of business and this vast in
crease in ihe wunber of buyers has been chiefly secured through ad
vertising and -the furnishing of the goods to, back up his claims. '-
Advertising makes possible the reduction in the price of the' goods
.through the increased "volume of business that it brings. Advertising
thus pays for Itself and it results to the benefit of the merchant and
the buyer. ' " ' - . - -: . , ' . " ,-' ' ' . - '
