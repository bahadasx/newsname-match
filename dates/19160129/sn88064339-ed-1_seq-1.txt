WHO PAYS FOR THE ADVIRTISIPNG
(Yasoo Sentinel.)
There is a prevailing opiUion among
farmers and the people in general who
are not nla busines that the money a
merchant pays for advertising is added
to the price of goods and that the onue
toimer is the one who really pays the
merchant's advertising bills. Many per
sons express their opinion freely along
this line, Which shows they have never
,liven it a moment of serious thought.
oIPrl',nee, we we il take a merchant
In a neighboring town for illustration.
He had never believed In advertising.
He was the owner of a men's furnish.
lag store, and had been wlling on an
average of three suitsof clothes a day
without advertising; and the prolt on
each suit was $3. This made a profit
of $9 a day or $64 a week. Not long
ago he decided to advertise for one
month, and the month's advertising
cost $16. He advertised to sell each
suit for $1 les than the regular price.
This made a promt of only $2 on each
suit. As a result of the advertising,
he sold sin suits a day which made a
prolt of $1I a day, or $T a weerk or
118 more per week than he had made
not advertllsng. At the end of the
month, after paying his advertisingla
bill, his profit was $67 more than the
month that he did not advertise.
Now, who paid for the advertlsing?
Each customer saved $1; the merchant
made $5? and the printer $1,. Now,
the question is, did anybody lose any
thing. This merchant saved the people
of his community $144 in a month and
made money by it. Now, away goes
your foolish notion of saving money
by trading with the merchant who
does not advertise.
Advertising is not a luxury, it is a
neessity. The customer does not pay
for it; ancreased sales pay for it. The
merchants who do not advertise are
the ones who howl most about the mail
order houses and hard times; and they
are also the very merchants who have
their envelopes printed in Washington,
D. C.. thereby patronlling the biggest
mail order conaer ino the world.

NORWOOD SOLVES
CANNING PROBLEMS
Herman J. Selferth in Time.-Peayune
The United States consumes an ls.
men.e quantity of canned vegetables,
and the market even covers the re
mainder of the world. Louisiana is
eapable of being made the world's
truck garden, raising vegetables in
profusion the whole year round. That
means she affords the ideal ield and
opportunities for aanneries. The in.
dustry has started, and despite the fact
that in almost every nestance the In
vestmentof capital has been inadequate
those properly eonducted to any de
gree have done well. The truth sur
vives, however, that Loutisiana is young
and inexperienced in the lndustry.
that there are many problerms to solve,
that the canning business Is destined
to grow into one of the state's richest
and most reliable assets, and that
more guidance for the future ean be
secured from the little plant at Nor.
wood than from any other, not exclud
ang the large establishments whlch are
daily advancing In patronage and It-i
portance,.
The Norwood plant, rough and un
pre tentius. is a model in a number of
ways. While it is a private venture it
is really a community enterprise and
was designed to care for the truck crop
of the section. Cotton had failed, veg.
etables were substituted, the right
season and markets were not struck,
and to avert disaster and conserve
hope, the cannery woe launched. It did
not study demand, easned the wrong i
stuff. did not And out how to stop
waste and leaks, and was not an ti.
spiring success. Now it Isto on its feet,
wiping out old scores, and will in a
few years be working the whole in
stead of part of the year,, proving the
mainstay of the farm community. The
story of the start has been told, that
of the evolution is new, and the re
cital need not be lengthy.
When the Louisiana DaIrymen met
at Norwood recently, W. A. West, one
of the leaders to the section's progress,
Invited the members to visit the plant. b
He said It had been in operation three a
years and hbad not yet made money but
had proven a boon to the truck grow. t
ere and the people. It was putting up
sauer kraut, beans, wild blackberries,
tomatoes, and sweet potatoes. Its out
put was being distributed in twenty
states, and as far west as Washington.
There had been no trouble with any
phase of operation in the last two
years, and is now a wonderful sucessae,.
It iis paying the farmers thirty eants a
bushel for sweet potatoes, $10 a ton
for their cabbage and tomatoes, and
arfty cents a bushel for green beans.
As the market was at their gate and
they received cash on the spot they
found that the prices paid them were
goed and did not interfere with the
marketing of their erops at larger
profit when the chanee offered.
One of the arst general lessons its
In here. Manager P. N. Steinberg, who
has turned defeat into victory, made
Pseveral things plain to the farmers
from his advent. One was that the
canunery was not the dumpinag ground
for culls, ripe., and other such plr
duets. Sueees required that only the
best vegetables be ned, and only the
best would he aeeepted. At the rsme
time, the truck that sold best fresh
was not always best to ean. He point
ed out the varieties he favored, and
insiated that they not only grow these
but grow them regularly and in quan
tity that would permit the plant to run
for the longest period posstbte. Bdahe
tion took time, and the profit argument
was the most convincing. When the
farmers were Ia full mood to co6perate
he went a little farther. At a Igaeral
maeting a few weeks ago be carried
hise final point. The farnera signed
oontracts for stated supply and rate,
and not for the crope they moat fancted
but for all the dtfferent vegetables the
cannery detided to handle in order to
operate moet advantageosty and for
the fullest time, That provides a safe
and sure basis upon whlsh to proceed
The next lesson was evidnat upon
entering the fetory, tin the tammeasel
pile of eanned yams whieh was not
beits disturbed but which is one of
the eeaeson's main esets. When the
potatoes were canned all the farmers
and factories were rushlang the erop to
market ad the price was low. Nor
wood did not rush. It ealeulated upon
the eise of the crop nd the duration
of the supply, and contracted for de
livery to the merehants after the sup.
ply was exhausted. The little matter
of storage will net II eats a dosen
more, and that marstgn o that one
product alone hi a handsome dividend,

ed and scaled, at the elbows of the
operators who out the material into
shape for canning. The discarded por
d lions take a trip down a chute and are
collected as slope to be fed to the hogs.
The prepared material deposits itself
on the weighing table to be transferred
to the open cans. The latter then
travel automatically along an endless
wire belt. At the end of the long table
the cans divide acoording to slse and
enter the compartments which extract
as much air as possible from the cans
before the tops are clamped on, no
solder being used. They then undergo
the steaming process, which does a
thorough job in order to turn out a
nerfect product and guarantee alalnst

Manufacturing Company plant, a kin.

pays the farmers 120 a ton for cayenne
and $60 a ton for tabasco peppers, pro.
eesses them mainly into a powder, and
has Induced the planting of 700 acres
of the pepper. Baton Rouge farmers
hare offered to plant a larger area, an
even larger factory will soon be erect.

both plants will eventually be in con
