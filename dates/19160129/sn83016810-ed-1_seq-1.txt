BIG IMPETUS FOR
ESTABROOK BOOM
"Dark Horse" For Republican
Presidential Nomination.
NATIONAL DEFENSE PIONEER
Known as Fearless Advocate of Tra
ditional Republican PrinciplesAlso
Recognized as One of Ablest Cam
paigners In United States.
Far and away the most interesting
phase of the national political situa
tion is the movement that has brought
Henry D. Estabrook, of New York and
Nebraska, so prominently to the front
as a candidate for the Republican pres
idential nomination. First spoken oi'
as a possibility in connection with the
presidency less than six months ago,
Mr. Estabrook is today one of the lead
ing candidates, with evidences of
strength that are a source of concern
to the friends of the other aspirants.
He has made speeches in every im
portant city in the East, Middle West,
and Far West, an arduous campaign
experience that has put him in good
condition to meet the rigorous demands
made on the head of a party's national
ticket, and his friends in Nebraska and
other States have formed Estabrook or
ganizations and are going after national
delegates in the most vigorous fashion.
Impartial observers agree that this
development of the Estabrook boom
has no parallel in the political history
HENRY D. ESTABROOK.
of the last 25 years, and they are be
ginning to inquire whether the popu
lar demand for new leadership is ac
tually so strong as to give this new
man the greatest political prize over
which men struggle.
An All Around Big Man.
Estabrook is a big man physically,
mentally and politically. Quite six
feet in height, erect, rugged, he would
be a man of commanding presence in
any gathering. His mental attainments
are attested by his signal success in
the practice of law and by the wide
spread interest in his every public ut
terance on governmental, economic
and social problems. He has always
been a student and when he discusses
a subject he speaks with the author
ity of one who has mastered it His
conclusions are invariably sound, and,
once he has arrived at them, they are
proclaimed frankly and fearlessly, for
he is essentially a man with the cour
age of his convictions.
For instance, he has been one of the
most drastic critics of President Wil
son and the present Democratic admin
istration, arraigning them for their
tariff law which bankrupted the fed
eral treasury and which places the
American farmer, the American manu
facturer, and the American laborer at
the mercy of foreign competition, and
for a foreign policy which has destroy
ed the respect that the American flag
and American citizens once command
ed in every quarter of the globe.
A Preparedness Pioneer.
Likewise Mr. Estabrook was the first
man prominently before the public to
outline a concrete program of national
defense, which he presented in an ad
dress before the American Bankers'
Association September 8th last at Seat
tle, characterized by the Seattle Times
as "one of the most remarkable ad
dresses ever delivered in the North-
west," and he was the first Republican
leader to point the way to the reunion
and harmonizing of all elements of the
party, his "Get-Together" plea before
the McKinley Club of Omaha, Nebras
ka, last October, having attracted wide
spread attention.
From the time Mr. Estabrook open
ed the Republican National campaign
in Chicago in 1896 he has been recog
nized as one of the ablest campaigners
in the United States, and there have
been few speakers in greater demand.
The issues in the great contest of
1916. which is to restore the Republic
an party to the administration of na
tional affairs, will be Protection, Pros
perity, and Preparedness, in Mr. Esta
brook's judgment, with "Get-Together"
as the slogan for Republicans of every
shade of opinion. He has been preach
ing this gospel in all sections of the
country, and has met with enthusiastic
receptions everywhere he has gone.

War Brings Profits to Gamer, Who
Ordered Too Much Chloride.
Parsons, Kan.Anton Gamer, a dry
cleaner, through a mistake ordered 100
instead of ten gallons of carbon tetra
chloride to be used in his cleaning
process last February, paying $1.29 a
gallon.
He attempted to persuade the drug
company to take back the ninety gal
lons, but it refused, and he figured he
had lost over a hundred dollars in the
transaction.
The war in the meantime caused the
price of the chemical to soar, and re
cently the chemical company of whom
he bought the order paid him $30.15 a
gallon for the ninety gallons it refused
almost a year ago. Gamer netted a
profit of more than $2,500.
RAISE A COW, SWEDE
SAYS, AND GET RICH
Treat Her Right and You'll Be
Rewarded.
St. Paul.Raise up a cow in the way
she should go, and before she is old
she will richly reward you.
C. N. Nelson, who lives just over the
Anoka county line, a few miles from
St. Paul, says.
Thirty-two years ago, when he,was
in the early twenties, Nelson landed in
Minnesota fresh from Sweden. His
total assets were 50 cents and the con
tents of a queer looking Swedish
clothes chest. Half an hour after his
arrival he was 50 cents poorer.
"When I got off a train in Minne
apolis all I had to direct me was a
card bearing the address of a cousin
who had come to America a short
time before," Mr. Nelson said. "I
showed the card to a hackman. who
also was Swedish. He took my 50
cents and drove me a few blocks,
pointing to one of the windows,
marked 444, said, 'There it is.' I had
supposed that the 'box 444' written on
the card was a street address. I did
not know how my cousin was to ap
pear from that box, but I stood with
eyes glued on the number from 10
o'clock in the morning until the middle
of the afternoon, afraid to look else
where for fear my cousin would come
in the meantime.
"When at last I heard two men at
one of the windows talking my lan
guage I told them my story. They
explained that I was in the postoffice
and that my cousin might not go there
for several days. I should have been
in a bad fix had not one of the men
invited me to come and do odd jobs at
his boarding house and earn my keep.
"My cousin did not come to town for
three weeks, and when he did he did
not help me because he could not He
had all he could do to earn a living.
"Then 1 worked in a railroad con
struction camp one summer and re
turned to the city with the intention
of going to school and learning Eng
lish. My first employer agreed to give
me my board for helping with the
milking, but I had not gone to school
many days when he met with an acci
dent He persuaded me that I would
learn English faster driving a milk
route than by going to school, so 1 be
came a dairyman and worked until I
had saved $1,000."
JUDGE A MODEL MAN.
Eighty-four and Promised Lincoln Not

Chester, Pa.Federal Judge Simeon
Woodrow King of Chicago, who paid
a visit to relatives in this city, is a re
markable man. He is in his eighty
fourth year and has never been sick a
day in his life.
He was appointed judge for the Unit
ed States court for the northern dis
trict of Illinois when he was twenty
one years and six months of age by
President Abraham Lincoln and has
been sitting as a jurist all that long
period.
"I have kept the promise I made to
Abraham Lincoln," Judge King says,
"and that promise was that I would
never smoke or chew tobacco, never
touch liquor and never tell an untruth."

A man giving his name as John

men were in the same room in her
place for an hour or more.
Finally Adams left the house alone.

Seattle, Wash.Many instruments re

tity of the thief.
Officials determined that the theft
had been committed in an unoccupied
building on the campus. At 3:40 o'clock
in the afternoon all the clocks in the
university's electric system stopped.
The master clock was found to be run

PRAISE IN GERMANY
Appreciation Shown For Her
Efforts In Feeding Aliens.
Berlin.Mrs. Gerard, wife of the
American ambassador here, is appeal
ing to her friends at home for funds
to carry on the American relief kitch
en of Berlin, which has daily fed some
200 women and children, the families
of men who are aliens in Germany and
therefore placed in concentration
camps, following the action which
Great Britain and France took in the
internment of aliens in those countries.
The American Association of Com
merce and Trade in Berlin gave the
money to run the kitchen for six
months when its doors were opened
last year in the quaint little building
in the Schlesische strasse, where Mrs.
Gerard and her committee of Ameri
can ladies found an unoccupied bouse
in the factory district of the east side.
Mrs. Gerard herself gave the coal sup
ply for the winter, so that the place
was kept open all afternoon, many of
the women and children having no
other place where they could keep
warm. The money was spent so eco
nomically that $1 furnished seven
wholesome meals.
This winter the enterprise is without
funds, and the doors of the American
relief kitchen have not been opened to
the crowds of hungry, poorly clad wo
men with babies in their arms and
clinging to their skirts who mournful
ly stand around and gaze through the
windows.
Long purses and generous ones
among the American colony have been
taxed to the utmost by the charity
needs arising from the war, and Mrs.
Gerard has won appreciation not only
in Berlin, but throughout Germany for
her large contributions of money and
the devotion of almost all of her time
to the alleviation of distress. On Nov.
11 the German government sent her
Red Cross decorations of the first and
second class to commemorate her serv
ices in connection with the effort to
help German prisoners of war in Rus

THE APPEAL
ST. PAUL AND MINNEAPOLIS. MINN.J SATURDAY: JANUARY 29,
THOS. FRANKSON.
First to File for Republican Nom
ination for Lieutenant Governor.
Mr. Frankson, Minnesota real estate
dealer, and former representative from
i Fillmore county in the sessions of
1911, 1912 and 1913, is the first candi
date to file for the Republican nomi
nation for lieutenant -governor. In
announcing his candidacy Mr. Frank

tion.
Rigid enforcement of the laws.
Good roads.
Progressive legislation consistent
with the needs and requirements of
the people.
For a greater Minnesota for the
rapid development of the agricultural
and commercial interests of the entire
state.
Mr. Frankson is a Scandinavian, and
was born in 1869 on a farm in Fill
more county on which b|s father lo
cated in 1854. He received his educa
tion in the public schools, taught

INDIANS GOOD FARMERS.
Developed as Such More Last Year
Than Ever Before.
Washington.The development of
agriculture and stock raising among
the Indians has been greater in the
last year than ever before, according
to the annual report of Cato Sells, com
missioner of Indian affairs. Love of
home and domestic happiness are be
coming at last, a more marked trait of
the Indian. A special effort is being
made to better the condition of the
Papago Indians, who are in southern
Arizona. The children are to be
taught the A C's.
"The Papagos," says the commission
er, "are among the most deserving of
any people I have ever known. Their
home for more than 200 years has
been in the driest desert in the United
States.
"Under these circumstances they
have demonstrated that the genius of
necessity works out wonderful things.
The Papagos have made their strug
gle unassisted, and their accomplish
ments, in view of their tremendous ob
stacles, are marvelous."
MEDAL FOR OBSTINACY.
Two Farmers Are Entered In the Con
test In Kansas.
Kansas City.Two of the most con
trary men in Kansas are boasted by
Smith Center. Last fall one man re
fused to pay the price asked by corn
huskers and vowed he would let his
field rot before he would yield.
Now the field, containing about 2,000
bushels of grain, still stands and is
grown up with a dense crop of sun
flowers.
The other contrary man is a neigh
bor of the first He husked 1,000 bush
els of his crop, stored it in an uncov
ered crib and said it would remain
there till It brought him 75 cents a
bushel. It is still there, but ruined by
the season's heavy rains.
FARMER'S IDEA SAVES
HIM TIME AND MONEY
Weuatcnee, Wash.Instead of haul
ing his wheat eighteen miles over a
bad road, as he did formerly, James
Keane of Rock Island is now letting
the grain slide into market through a
galvanized iron pipe. The former
method cost from 15 to 20 cents a
bushel to market By this latter way
the gram can be handled for 2 cents
a bushel.
The new system has been in opera
tion for a couple of years and bids fair
to continue, at least until the natural
law of gravitation is abolished.
Keane owns land which lies on a
large plateau over 2,000 feet above the
little town of Rock Island. It has al
ways been expensive for the farmer
to drive a long distance to get off the
plateau and back into town, and as
the road wound around the side of the
bluffs it was very rocky and danger
ous.
Two years ago the iron pipe idea
came to Keane. He purchased and in
stalled 2,500 feet of two inch galvaniz
ed iron piping, and the saving the first
year paid for it. The pipe runs from
Keane's west field down a steep hill to
within 400 feet of the warehouse in
the town.
When he wishes to take two or three
loads of wheat to market the grain is
poured into a large sheet iron hopper
fitted over the top of the iron pipe line.
The grain runs along merrily through
the pipe to the town, where it Is receiv
ed at the rate of about a sack a min
ute, which is as fast as it can be han
dled.
To save more time and money Keane
has attached an apparatus known as
the "sacker" from a thrashing machine
to the town end of the pipe line,
which automatically receives, sacks
and weighs the grain. A man does the
sewing.
Keane has a monopoly on the big
plateau, which embraces about 5,000
acres of tillable land. Last year he
planted most of it and harvested near
ly 100,000 bushels of wheat
The land lies exposed to the periodi
cally hard winds that frequent this
part of the state during the summer,
and there have been years when part
of the wheat crop would be piled in
high drifts of dirt When the season
)s favorable few farmers are more
handily located than Keane. with bis

America Should Adopt System, Says
Harriot Stanton Blatch.
Washington.Mrs. Harriot Stanton
Blatch, president of the Woman's Po

says:
"I am of the opinion that America
should adopt the only democratic na

"I would have conscription on a plan
lomewhat similar to that enforced in
Switzerland at the present timean
enlistment of two months at first to
continue for shorter periods each year
a system that would harmonize all
sections of our country. In my opin
ion we want to be made a mucb more
homogeneous people, and therefore
those that enlist from the east should
be sent to the west and those from the
south sent to the north, and a perfect
understanding would be brought about
between various sections.
"This conscription imposed upon men
should also be obligatory for women,
who as citizens, but not as soldiers,
should know how to efficiently do their
share in coming to the aid of their
country in time of calamity.
"Girls should be forced to train in
various departments of the civil serv
ice, in the postofflces, in all the mu
nicipal departments, and to women I
would apply the same ideas as to the
menthat is to say, send them to va
rious parts of the country, so that they
