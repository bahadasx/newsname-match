First Strike
In Blairsville
Blairsville is going through the
first labor strike in the history of
the town. Thursday morning at about
10:30 o'clock, approximately 10 work
men employed by Columbia Plate
Glass Works, acting as a result of
being refused increased wages walk
ed out. The managers of the Glass
Works, fearing trouble, decided to
close the plant for a few days at least
during which etforts will be made
to have the trouble adjusted® and
to again start operations.
The strike while serious, in a de
gree, for the moment, cannot offset
the prosperity era and with its settle
ment it is expected that business
will go forward with a rush.
I can furnish you men for outside
work. Inquire Joe Melley, or at this
office.

Town Stirred
Over Finding
a Child's Leg
County Seat Aroused by Poospects
of Sensation That Failed to
Develop
The sleepy little town of Clear
field says the Dußois Express, was
wide awake in spots yesterday
morning when it became known
that the authorities were delving
into the mystery that surrounded
the finding of a baby's leg in a
garbage can.
Hints of sensation, a scandal, a
real story, all securely veiled by
the depths of mystery that seemed
to prevail, filled the air and were
elaborated upon and compounded
with interest until everybody had
their eyes open to the next move
in the steps to solve the problem.
But the county authorities had
the story ahead of the general pub-
iic and just about the time said G.
F. was getting thoroughly warm
ed to it the officials came through
with the answer to the problem,
which took the wind out of the
sails of the good ship Senseation.
The leg was one that had been am
putated by a physician and had
gone astray from the usual chan
nels of disposal of such things.
It was good while it lasted and
was imbibed to the point of ex
hileration. but it ended abruptly
and the county seat again sumb
ers.
