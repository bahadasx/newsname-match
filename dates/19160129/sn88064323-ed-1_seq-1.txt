GHEVBiAL, MANSFIELD'S
WELL-KNOWN ROLT
Live« Again In 'A Parisian
Romance."
II Cooper (' 1 iIT'.•. Celebrated
English Actor, Plays Part
of Roue, With Dorothy
Grten As the Seductive
Rosa of the Opera
Baron Olievital (H. Cooper
Uliffe) is a wealthy i'ariniau, a
fop, a prematurely aged rone.
Hin whole Interest in life neuters
in woman, or rather women, for
Ins list of conquests is large. No
member of the opposite sex who
comes under the Baron's eyes es
capes before he Hppraises her
char ms, weighs them with those
of others and catalogues them in
the recesses of ins depraved
brain. It is his hobby in life, Ins
vocation and his avocation, tins
oeusoring of feminine loveliness.
Rosa (Dorothy Green), the in
comparable dancer of tlie Opera
< omiqne, comes to the notice of
Chevrial. lie pays homage to
her beanry by establishing her in
the most luxurious of quarters
and by lavishing upoD her the
major part of his inexhaustible
income. Rosa toys with the Ba
ron with feline cunning llis lib
erty extends only to the end of
hor downy paw; nor is the paw
always downy. In moments of
caprioe it falls with untempend
force.
Henri de Targy and Therese
Beauchamp, the son and the
daughter of business partners,
are in love. The elder de Targy
robs hia partner in business.
Beauchamp, Hr , reduced to pov
erty, casts about for means by
which to rehabilitate bis for
tunes He is approaohed by Ba
ron Chevrial who desires to mar
ry Therese. Therese, despite her
protests, Is given in marriage to
the old debauchee. Henri de
Targy marries Mar< «lJe, a frt ol
on» yonng creator»- who aspires
to bt: an opera sing r.
R iron Chevrial, ven after his
marriage, continuée his relations
with Rosa, the dan cr. Whil he
does not openly ii.«unt the r<da
tiorship in the fare of his wife,
Therese, he make uo effort to
conceal it. And then a new w m
en enters bis life; she is Mar
celle, wife of Henri de Targy.
De Targy is serving »» Chevml's
secretary. Cbevri..! directs his
attention to the conquest of Mar
cello- She rebuffs him. Her at
titnde, however, is not the result
of moral scruples, for she elopes
soon aftet with Julian!, an opera
tenor.
Therese and Henri, originally
lovers, are thrown together daily
in the Chevrial borne. Each loves
the other, bat neither dares give
expression to the promptings of
the heart. Therese snffera hnmi
liation at the hands of the old
roue without a murmur; Henri
snffera the anguish of seeing the
woman he loves subjected to in
dignity.
Chevrial,in making the cycle
of bis charmera, returns to Rosa
He decides to give a party in
honor of her birthday. The
guests are to be Rosa's fellow
players at the Opera Comiqne.
The Chevrial banquet ball is
thrown open, scores of servants
arrange for the dinner and Rosa
and the ballet girls, still in cos
tnme, are brought from the opera
bouse in motor cars. While the
dinner is in progress, the Baron
rises to propose a toast to Rosa,
when he is stricken with apoplexy
and drops «lead. Marcelle, who
eloped with Jnliani, has come to
an untimely end. As a result,
Therese and Henri are free to
marry.

! KNOWLEDGE OF FOOD
VAi LIES IS IMPORTANT
Many foods liav< far greater
feeding value than oth
ers, says Conkey.
By G. E Conkey.
Just-is deep study is required
of the hi nil who would raise
chickens successfully as is needed
in other kinds of business. And
one of the first things he must
learn is t he different elements in
foods and the effect of these ele
men I s on the fowl.
Protien, the name given to all
substances in which nitregen is
the principal element, is necessa
ry in all rations, tor it enters
largely into muscle, blood, nerves,
etc. Not only must the waste he
renewed In the fowl, but the
great strain of egg production
must also bo taken care of.
PROTIEN ESSENTIAL
The protien elements build
bone, flesh (not fat) and feathers.
Also they replace the waste from
the body. Life cannot exist
without them. However, it is
impossible to secure a strictly
protien food as this always oomes
mixed with other elements.
There are certain foods which are
high in protien and are theiefore
called protien foods. 'The most
common and well known of these
foods are Cottonseed Meal, Lin
seed Meal, Gluten Meal, Reef
Scrap, Fish Scrap, Dried Blood
and Meat Meals. Because of
their protien couteuts, such foods
as listed above mint not be fed as
I'berally as one would feed ordi
nary grains. In the first place,
excessive feeding would waste it,
and in the second place the or
gans of the fowl would be over
taxed aud disease would result.
AgaiD, It proves too expensive.
Therefore watch your protien
and be careful not to feed too
much.
FEED OAItnOIIYDRATKS
Carbohydrates, which contain
starch» « and sugar*, can be call
ed the iuel of the body, for they
furnish the heat. Carbohydrates
must I fed to keep ihe tempeia
tore of the fowl nounal, but not
too much so as this develops fat
Care must be tak**n to prevent
the foul from becoming lazy and
Inactive. Foods r i*• li in carbohy
drates are Corn, Cornmeal,
Gronnd Oats, Barley, Buckwheat,
Rice, Wheat, etc.
MINERAL MATTER
Bone, oyster shells and grit
contain a liberal percentage of
minerai matter, which is mainly
phosphates of calcium and sodi
uin. These are essential in build
ing bone, part of the feathers,
certain constituents of blood aud
in shell making.
ANIMAL FOODS OOOI)
Milk. Beef Scrap, Fish Scrap,
Blood Meal, Green Bone, etc.,
come under the beading of animal
foods and take The place of
worms and bags that fowls uatu
rally And when running at large
These foods are positively neces
sary for the growing chick and
laying fowl and no amount of
vegetable protlen can be snbsti
toted. Soar milk and buttermilk
are the most wholesome foods in
thisolass. Dry buttermilk which
can now be purchased in sanitary
dry form, answers this purpose
admirably. This materially as
sists in the food digestion by
keeping the digestive organs in
the best of condition and is al
most indispensable in crate fat
teoing.
Beef Bcrap is often fed in a
hopper or put in the mash at a
mixture from 15 per cent to 25
per cent. As this varies in qual
ity, be sure to get the best as yon
may endanger the health of your
fowls. When dry buttermilk is
used, cat the beef scrap in half.
Green bone should be always
fresh and not more than 4 ounce
per day should be fed or bowel
trouble will follow. Green bone
appears to be too stimulating tor
breeding stock, as it lessens the
egg fertility. Blood meal iB not
a popular animal food for while
it ii high in protien, it lacks in
fat which is a valuable coostltu
t in animal foods.
OKEBN foods
Green foods include all kinds
of fruits, vegetables and growing
grasses or grains. Alfalfa meal,
Cat Clover, Sprouted Oats, Cab
bage, Lettuce, Beets, Beet Pnlp,
etc., are used mostly in poultry
feeding. Green feed should be
fed d ily or at least several
rimes week to get the proper
••suit One of the most valia
ble of green foods is sprouted
oats.
Ore*-« food Is no 1 need for its
uutrfti e value lnr< rather for its
tonic d laxative effects. Sue
r nient greens shonbl never be en
tirely displaced by such foods as
alfalfa or cut clover

President Carranza is rap
idly restoring peace to all parts
of Mexico, aud in a short while,
there is every reason to believe
lie will have the entire republic
of Mexico pacified and prosper
ous; he has promised to do everj
tiling possible to capture the
murderers and punish them. *
Last May the German Govern
ment murdered 115 American citi
zens when they unlawfully sank
the Lusitania She lias repeated
this crime several times since,
am) still there is no clamor in
this country for war with Ger
many: If Uncle Sam refuses to
light "any one his Bize", like Ger
many, he is not such a c »ward as
to declare a lidiculous war
against Mexico, simply because
he would be sure of victory. The
clamor for tins war conies from
such men as William Kuudol; h
Hearst, who owns a stung of pa
pers including such cities as Bos
ton, New York, Chicago, San
Francisco, aud other places and
is alleged to cont loi or own the
Washington Post, and a munie r
of other papers secie.tly Mr.
UearHt has been the most persh
tent promotei of war with Mexico
of any man in the country. Ho
he through his editors, it is be
lieved writes the editorials foi
the Washington Post clamorii g
for war ami the next day he sends
a two column telegram to the
Washington Post congratulating
it on an editorial for war, which
was written no doubt at lus dicta
tion. Mr. nearst will folget
some day aud come out and con
gratulate himself on his own edi
torials.
Mr. Hearst owns gre«i tract sof
lands, probably a million acres
in Mexico aud if be co ud induce
the United States to light, Mexico
and annex it, his land would
piotably be worth one handled
million dollars. So i< Is clear
that he has a strong motive foi
wishing to plunge the two conn
tries into war. By owning a
number of newspapers "secretly'
he can make a big how! and has
made such a howl so big it has
scared the Henate. But the
howls are nothing but the
screams of the chorous of the
Hearst editors in the p»tiers
which he secretly or publicly
owns.
SOUTH AMERICA INTERESTED
For more than twenty years the
United States have been trying
to draw the South American Re
publics into closer relation and
friendship with the United
Btates, and we bave succeeded
admirably in this endeavor. To
declare war against Mexico would
tarn every South American ooun
try against ns, because South
America aud Mexico both belong
to the latin race. For this rea
son as well as humanitarian rea
sons President Wilson desires to
avoid war with Mexico, and so do
all real American people.

10 Cents a Pound.
New York, Jan. 25—The New
York Depart ment of Food and
Markets of which John J. Dillon
is commissioner, gave out today a
statement, saying that it had au
tbentlcinfoimatioD from Chicago
that the combination cf Chicago
packers known as the "beef trnst"
had cornered the cold storage
poultry market in oDe of the big
gest deals ever made. They have
bought, forty million pounds, or
twenty tons, of poultry now iu
cold storage.
The highest prices paid «ere
25c and 28c for broil» rs, 2Je a
pound for roast I Dg chicken».
The scheme is, if is «aid, since
practically tbe balk of the cold
storage chicken is under control
to raise the price from 50 lo 40
per cent. This will mean that
Toasting chickens will be from 35c
a ponnd to 40 and 45c for broil

It Always Helps
says Mrs. Sylvania Woods, of Clifton Mills, Ky., in
writing of her experience with Cardui, the woman's
tonic. She says further: "Before I began to use
Cardui, my back and head would hurt so bad, 1
thought the pain would kill me. I was hardly able
to do any of my housework. After taking three bottles
of Cardui, 1 began to feel like a new woman. I soon
gained 35 pounds, and now, I do all my housework,
as well as run a big water mill.
I wish every suffering woman would give
CMtDIII
The Woman's Tonic
a trial I stiil use Cardui when I feel a little bad,
and it always does me good."

tired, worn-out feelings, etc., are t?ure signs of woman
