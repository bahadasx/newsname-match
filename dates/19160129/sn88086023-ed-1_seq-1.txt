SAN DIEGO. Jan 2. At least 50
! persons were believed to have been
j killed late Thursday when the lower
I dam of the San Diego water system
j in the Otay valley south of here
j broke under the heavy pressure of the
j flood waters. A wall of water 4S
feet high was released.
Sweeping down the valley the great
flood of water carried people, live
stock and valuable farm property to
destruction.
The heavy rains of the last few
day's filled the lower Otay dam for
the first time in its history.
Unable longer to withstand the ter
rific weight of the water, the dam
gave way releasing a flood of water.
Warnings of the impending danger
of the break had been given to thi
people In the valley, but few heeded
them, it was said, choosing to stay
and endeavor to protect their pro
perty. Rescuers were unable to reach the
scene of the disaster last night as all
bridges were washed out and tho
, swollen streams were so treacherous
that it was impossible to launch boat
tc go to the rescue.
Several bodies have been seen float
ing in the flood waters, according to
reports received here.
The property loss will amount to
at least 11.000.000. Because of the
fact that they were isolated bv tha
breaking yf the dam. which shut off
onj means or reacning otner com
munities, hundreds of families in the
vicinity wre facing a food famine.
