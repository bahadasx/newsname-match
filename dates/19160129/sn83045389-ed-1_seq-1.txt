GRIMSLEY'S DEATH
IS PUZZLE TO POLICE
William and Mary College Stu
dent Dies From Cerebral Hem
orrhage, Caused by Blow.
FRIEND OF GOVERNOR STUART
Mysterious Phases qf Case Give
Rise to Suspicions of
Foul Play.
The police arc baffled over the death
last night at ? o'clock of William Mor
gan OrlmBley, of William ami Mar>J
College, a student who stood high in
Ills class. and who was to have grad
uated this spring with honor*. Mr.
Grlmsley died last night at the Vir
ginia Hospital, where he was removed
yesterday afternoon Just before 2
o'clock, suffering from a cerebral hem
orrhage
Whether he died from natural causes
or whetht-r he was the \tctim of foul
play cannot br determined until this
morning at 1 t o'< lock, when Coroner
Taylor will hold an inquest and .post
mortem examination at i he Virginia
Hospital.
Young Grim; ley was a -student of
the highest type, thp editor of one of
th? college publico tip its. and had
worked his ?a> through four vesrs of
College. He was a friend and protege
of Governor .Stuart, and his moral life
w as a bove it,. ch.
AecortMnjr to the story as told to the
police, the ambulance \? a? tailed from
the Virginia Hospital yesterday after
noon shortly before 'J oVim k to go to
1C5 Mayo Street.

The atnbulan<*e. in care of Pr. Taylor.
Called and found Mr. Grtmsley un
conscious. He was carried to the hos
pital, and every attention was given
lilnt. At 9;lft o'clock last night he
died, without having tegained con
sciousness.
He had not been robbed. for on his
person was found his watch and about
JCt in cash
Mr. Grlmoley. according to the story
told bv Horten?e Itlsir, staggcre'J up
to the door of her home with his coat
in his h?nd and s.tated that he was
tired an<J sick and asked thai lie be
allowed to corae in and rest for x
minute or ?o He was brought into
the house, and when it was s? pii that
he was suffering he was ^i C'i .??tten
t ion.
The women, three in number, stated
that he was suffering, ami that bis f?cc
was covered with blood. They cal'ed
the Virginia Hospital and aske-1 for
t}ie? ambulance. This was immediately
dispatched to the ?r>f and Mr Grims
ley was rushed to this institution.
POI.M K I\\KSTMiATK
M Sl*l< MM S t in< IJPiTlM KS
The police received their notification
front the hospital, ami immediately De
tective Sergeants Kellatn and Wily b?
gan to investigate the rase. They
called at the house from whence the
call for the ambulance came, but the
women were out. Officers on the beat
slated that tliev had probably gone
for a ride and would return later.
The death certificate from the hos
pital stated simply that "William Mor
gan Grlmsley came tn bis dentil as the
result of a cerebral hemorrhage, prob
ably caused l?y a blow on the head."
The theory is. however, --nice no
marks or abrasions appear upon either
the body or head, that Mr. Grlmsley,
while suffering from a cerebral hem
orrhage. wandered downtown without
knowing what he was doing.
Mr. Grinisley. who was to have grad
uated this spring, "was about twenty,
five years of age. He was one of the
editors of one of the college, publica
tions, and ua^ in Kiohmond soliciting
subscriptions to this publication. His
father, a Itaptist minister, of Van
T*yke. . Russell Comity, is a' close per
sonal friend of Governor Stuart, and
the cKv'ef executive was much dis
tressed\ last night over the untimely
death o his >oung frierd.
WAS WORKIMi MIS
WAV THIMH <;il COI.I.HC.K
When Mr. Grlmsley entered William
and Mary College, Governor Stuart,
was so convinced of his sterling quali
ties that he asked to be allowed to
defray all expenses for the college
course. Mr. Gritnsley. however, stated
that he preferred fo work bis way
through'collegc. and had done so since
he entered. He would have graduated
this spring, having defrayed his ex
penses until this time.
In speaking of him last night. Gov
ernor Stuart said (hat Mr. Gritnsley
was a young man whose character was
above question, lie was convinced that
no reproach could attach to the death
of his young friend, whether it be '
from foul play or from natural causes, j
The police were working on the mise
throughout the night, and no arrests '
were made, though if the autopsy to- :
day proves that Mr. Grimsley was the 1
victim of foul play, tlio officers claim
to he in a position to close down upon I
those who may be suspected of the ;
crime.
