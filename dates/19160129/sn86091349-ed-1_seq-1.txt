Storm King Comes To Pioche
and Leaves Path of
Destruction
DORIS CYANIDE PLANT A TOTAL WRECK
Narrow Escape of Mrs. Edwin Price:-H6usei
Ruthlessly Overturned An Uncanny Night
of Sleeplessniess and Fear.
Old Boreas swooped down upon
Piathe last Thursday evening and for
sevtial hours his reign was supreme.
Never before did this hale old rascal
cut such pranks in this mining town
n dy U ia .to be hoped that he
never will again. He Is a most unwel
.come visitor, particularly since the
Inventory has been taken of the ruin
Thursday night. Besides frightening
hundreds of citizens out of their wits,
a number of buildings were picked up
twisteu' and turned until they were
reduced to mere fragments and. in
some Instances, occupants narrowly
escaped with their lives.
The new mill building recently con
strued by the Dorris Mining & Mill
ing company was completely demol
ished. The structure, although built
with the view of withstanding any
onslaughter of the elements, was a
mere paper box when the wind
struck it. The strong timbeis In the
tame work were broken into kind
ling wood' and the sheets of corrugat
ed iron with which! the building was
enclosed were carried for blocks and
twisted and turned into a million!
shapes. - ' i i ,'
Probably the most miraculous es
cape reported was at the home of
Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Price. Mr Price
hearid the- doors of his work shoif
located) in the rear of his residence,
rattling and told Mrs. Price who was
in the front room with her baby In
her arms, that he would go out and
shut tbJem. He hadhardiv left the
building when a 2x5 timber camel
crashing into the dining room head
on, upsetting a table containing a
lamp. Mrs. Price ran for the lampl
And extinguished it. hardly getting
out of the way when another timber
of the same dimensions came plow
ing1 its way through the wall. pen-
dxating the bottom of a wash"
tub, as it wintered. Meanwhile, tim--bej
and1 debris from the mill werd
flying Jn all directions and when Mr.
Price was almost within arms length
of the, shop doors, that building
.collapsed'.! By this time it dawned
upon! Mr,, and Mrs. Prite that it
was "moving time" for them and
Srfushqcl post haste for the home of
Judge Horsey for shelter.
'The hurricane crossed the canyon
utiere the residence of James E.
Price was. picked up and hurled into
tidd strew, bottom side up. the de-
i j'ris spreading over a portion of
the lot in the rear of Elliot Larsen's
home. This building had been used
by James Price. Jr., and his broth
er John, as sleeping quarters, and for
a time grave appehension was felt
ilat) John was in the building at
the time it tumbled over. But the
young man. luckily for him, happen
ed to be at the residence of Mr.
and MrsJ Dave Empey. There was
& fire in the heating stove. , but
th'is was extinguished by the crowd
which! soon gathered and probably
prevented the further catastrophe ot
a serious conOawatlon in the hetrt
of the business section of town.
I 'Down "Main street, the force of
,1hel wind broke some of the front
windows of Dorothy's barber shop
and one glass was droken in Joe'
Powers' saloon. The shaft house at
