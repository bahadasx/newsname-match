KEEP COOL
an buy the kind of cca that will
keep you cool with the feweet
trips to the cellar. Try our coal
this year. You'll find it goes so
much farther than ordinray fuel
that when warm weather comes
around you'll have a nice little
pile left to start the next season
on. That proves it's coal economy
to buy here.

For better stylus material, a Victor expert disc »vered the
miraculous reproducing and wearing qualities of tungsten.
J lie Tungs-tone Stylus will play from fifty to two
hundred records or even more.
The * life of the Tungs-tone Stylus depends on the
character and volume of the records played.
Von don't have to change the Tungs-tone Stylus until
it wears out. When this takes place the stylus simply
stops reproducing as a signal for a new one. There is no
danger of Spoiling the record, because, strange to say,
tungsten is softer than the record, a though its wearing
quality is oue to two hundred per cent, better than the
hardest steel. We cannot explain why—it is one of na
ture'e secrets—a phenomenon. We o dy know it is true
and recommend the Tungs-tone Stylus to all Victor users.
No needles to change is the chief nostrum of manufac
turers of machines operated with a permanent jewel point,
but the
VICTOR COMPANY .
knows what others will learn in time, namely: that no per
manent point can be made to last forever on hard disc
records. The jewel stylus was a success on the old wax
cylinder records, but jewels do wear rough in time, and, if
not instantly detected and changed, will quickly spoil a
valuable collection of records—a most insidious danger;
hence the Victor Steel Needle, to be used but once, was the
only practical needle for the new gramophone type of hard
record until the discovery of the miraculous properties of
tungsten for reproducing styli.
Tungs-tone is a trade name and was coined for the
occasion.
The new Tungs-tone Stylus is made in soft tone as
well as in full tone, aud can be changed instantly, just the
same as a steel needle.
The virtue of the Tungs-tone Stylus lies in a small
cylinder of tqngsten projecting fixm the < nd of a steel
holder in which it is rigid'y set.
The tiny cylinders of tungsten reproduce Victor
Records better than any known material.
Smooth, «strong and full as to tone.
TheVictor Tungs-tone Stylusfits all Victorsound boxes.

As a result of assistance
given them by a local bank,
the pig club boys in Cal
casieu parish raised 105 pigs
in 1015, which is a greater
number than were raised by
club members in any other
parish. The money with
which to purchase the pigs
was lent the boys by the
First National Bank of Lake
Charles. No endorsement
was required and no interest
charged for the first twelve
months. The recommenda
tion of the parish superinten
dent or the demonstration
agent was required in each
case.
Banks in several other pa
rishes, am mg which are
Webster, Winn, St. Mary,
Tangipahoa and Lafayette,
are making plans to lend
money to boys who wish to
raise pigs underdhe regula

The garden pea is a cool
season vegetable that re
quires a considerable period
of time for its proper de
velopment and maturity. If
planted in March, the hot
weather of May and June
may cause partial or com
plete failure. When plant
ed the latter part of January
and the first of February,
they usually develop by the
middle of April to the * first
of May, and generally pro
duce a good crop. The more
hardy varieties of peas are
sometimes planted in Decem
ber, and the plants given
light protection with straw
when small, but only the
more hardy varieties can be
planted at that season with
any assurance of going
through the winter.
Of the hundreds of named
varieties, for general pur
poses we would suggest the
Alaska, McLean's Advancer,
