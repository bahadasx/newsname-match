TAKES DECie LEAP UPWARD
The Declination of David E. Curtin to
Make the Race is Clearing the
Atmosphere.
Friends of Charles F. Enright Trying to
Induce Him to Enter the Arena
of Politics.
With the declination ot David E.
Curtin to make the race for. the Demo
cratic nomination for mayor, which
fas announced this week, there ha8
tfy" been a narrowing of the field of can
didates, and as a result It Is expected
that popular sentiment will soon
crystallize and from that time on It
will be smooth sailing for Is It not
written that the Democratic nominee
will be the next mayor of St. Joseph?
The hosts of friends of good natured
Dave Curtin are much disappointed
over his refusal to enter the contest,
but his reasons do not permit of ques
tion. No one knows Dave Curtln's
mind or Dave Curtin's business better
than Dave Curtin, and when he de
cided the point It was decided for once
and all.
WALTER
"I cannot help but feel proud of
the hunilretls of friends who have
"3(jd me to make the race and volun
tarily pledged me their support," said
he, "but my business affairs require
my time and attention, and I cannot
infringe on It to make the race."
Curtin made a phenomenal race two
years ago against great odds,, his per
sonal popularity and his splendid qual
ifications being the factors that all
but made him the head of this great
city.
Robinson Stock Soaring
With the withdrawal of Curtin the
stock of Walter H. Robinson, whlcn
was already at a high point, took a
flying leap upward, as Curtln's declina
tion removed his then most formidable
opponent In the Democratic ranks.
Since the retirement of Curtin there
have been mentions of several other
Democrats, but so far no one has Been
fit to openly announce his candidacy.
Henry Vogelman, whom It was at
first supposed would run on the regu
lar ticket, has since announced that
he would tun as an Independent,
wdlch leaves him In the hands of the
people, irrespective of party, although
.. 1. n nlti'niiH Knnn a
lir voigeiiimu u )
Intrusted and devoted Democrat.
Robinson Will Run
TLe friends of Walter II. Robinson,
the well-known automobile dealer,
have finally Induced him to make an
oren avowal, and he has consented to
make the race, much to their satisfac
tion, for they feel that wjth him as a
candidate there can bo no such thing
as failure. In the past two campaigns
Mr. Robinson had been Importuned to
become a candidate, but on each occa
sion declined, and In place, went out
and devoted his energies and gave of
o
lis money . to elect the Democratic
nominee. This time he will yield to
his friends desires and run.
"I can appreciate no honor more
highly than that of being the execu
tive head of a city of the wealth,
learning and commercial importance
of St. Joseph," said Mr. Robinson yes
terday, "and if the voters of this city
see fit to elect me to that honorable
position, 1 shall give every ounce of
energy I possess to the task and thus
repay them for the trust that they
place in me and another thing and
that Is the most Important of nil 1
shall give my best efforts to a busi
ness administration for all of the peo
ple of St. Joseph, and in every way
push forward Its commercial suprem
acy H. ROBINSON
"And another thing I shall have
no friends to reward nor no enemies
to punish. I want to give my best
elforts for all of the people."
Mr. Robinson Is a man known to,
every voter in St. Joseph. With tne
single exception of police commis
sioner, he has never held public office
with emolument, although he has
filled a number of honorary positions,
notably that of president of the fa
mous Monroe Club, with credit and
honor. He Is a good business man
and has made a success.
Enright Not Decided
With the withdrawal of Dave Cur
tin a large number of the friends of
Charles F. Enright began work to
bring him out as a candidate, but so
far their efforts have met with no
success. Mr. Enright is a man of
many business interests which de
mand his attention, and this it is evi
dent has much to do with his uncer
tainty. When questioned, Mr. Enright
smiled and admitted that he had given
the matter some thought but waB not
as yet prepared to say what he would
do tn the premises, "it Is an honor
that no man could fall to recognize,";
said he, "and I, being a native born,
would feel that It was the greatest
that I could achieve." '
The friends of Ed A. King are not
satisfied without An expression from
him, and are trying to Induce htm to1
come out, but so far without success.
There is no better qualified business
man In St. Joseph than Ned King, Hnd
none who has had more experience
or a better comprehension of St. Jo
seph's needs than be.
There are still others who are
"spoken of."
HER NAME WAS MAUD
She Was To Have Conveyed Her
Owner To the Inauguration of
William JennHgs Bryan
Petersburg, Ind., Jan. 27. Maud,
aged 42, the famous mule owned by
W. H. Uerrldge, who figured promi
nently In Bryan's first campaign for
president, was chloroformed last night
by Its owner. At the time Dryan mado
his first race for president, Mr. Uer
rldge was so confident Bryan would
win that he prepared Maud for a long
trip to Washington, where, after con
gratulating Mr. Uryan on his success,
Berridge Intended to present the ani
mal to him.
At that time Maud was about 23
years old. Uryan was defeated, but
Uerrldge was so confident of Bryan's
ultimate success that he said he would
keep the animal alive until Bryan be
came president of the United States.
Again In 1908 he made all arrange
ments for the trip. Maud was then 34
yeats old, but was hale and hearty.
Again her owner was doomed to dis
appointment. Not daunted, Uerrldge
still had faith in his Idol, but after
Bryan's resignation from the cabinet
Maud seemed to beepme despondent.
Life no longer had any interest for
her. Her decline was rapid. Every
thing possible was done for her, but
of no avail. Her owner had a nice
giave dug for her, and a number of
his intimate friends were invited to
attend the funeral. Berridge owns a
tombstone plant, and tlu following
marker will adorn Maud's grave:
"Here lies Maud. She Is gone but not
forgotten."
THE LAST FEW DAYS
(As sung by Julius Straus.) '
There were blankets on the gas stove
Tenderly we placed them there
So the last faint spark we cherished
Might not anlsh into air. I
feebler grew the dying embers,
Cold the room but colder stiil
Was the marrow in our backbone,
Which had frozen with the chill.
And our eyelids glued together I
With white crystal drops of Ice,
i While we muttered in the shadows
Words that sounded far from nice.
And the gas man sits and snickers,
In his snug and easy chair. ,
Chuckling how he puts it on us- '
'Stead of gas, we get hot air.
A RECORD SCORE MADE
In a Friendly Game of Double-Deck
Pinochle, a Score of
2070 Is Made
For the last three months Thomas
Downs. William Atchison, William
Wilson and Everett Clark have met
evenings and enjoyed a friendly game
of pinochle, all being enthusiasts of
the German style, I. e double deck of
cards. Wednesday evening, last, they
met on the street near William Wil
son's home and in banter suggested
that Downs and Atchison play part
ners against Wilson and Clark, a din
ner wager to add zest to the game.
As It Was dinner time, all agreed, and
went to Schaeffer's restaurant on
Third street.
Two packs of cards were secured,
the discards made and the pack shuf
fled. After the deal the bidding began
with Atchison's declaration of 200.
Wilson bid 205. The contest for
trumps settled between Atchison and
Wilson; 500 was the next bid by
Atchison, with a raise of 5 by Wilson.
Then Atchison bid 1,500. Wilson
raised It to 1,505. The last bid was
1,770 by Atchison with a raise of 5 by
Wilson to 1,775.
Wilson announced spades as trumps
and on the meld disclosed 1,500
trumps, with double pinochle, 300,
making a total of 1,820 meld, his part
ner holding the two delces. In the
play for high score, Clark, Wilson's
partner, held both aces of diamonds,
and the play led so that he took the
laBt two tricks, the partners taking
all tricks, bringing their score to 2,070
that Is, 1,820 meld and 250 cards.
Had Atchison secured the bid at 1,770
his meld would have been with clubs
as trumps, 1,520. and would have
taken all tricks, making a total of
1,770.
It Is quite rare for a plnophle game
to produce such a high melding hand
as took place in this game, as it Js
usually a "frame up" when It does
occur, but In the above game. Inas
much as the dinners were the wager,
there was no chance to "stack the
cards" as all the above mentioned!
men are amateurs and play onl' for
the enjoyment of the game. Fred1!
Keucker, Mark Morgan and William
Wise were witnesses to this recoid
and.

Tha Members of His Own Party
V rlfy the Statements of Sec
retary of State Roach
Ith reference to John E.
Swh-igi r's published statement,
S"cretary of State Cornelius
Roach said:
"Thi issues raised by Colonel

I ; 'Jvith both the Republican and

ocratlc members of said corn-
all of whom attached
their names to the statements I
quoted. Colonel Swanger Is at
liberty to settle, his differences
with those of his party who In-
vestlgated before they reported.
"True It Is the laws he admin-
(stored as secretary of stato were
not exactly the same as those I
administered, but as a stato offi-
clal In the interest of the state
and the public service I saw that
changes In the law were made
for the financial benefit of the
people. The auditing committee,
consisting of both Republicans
and Democrats, also stated that
the financial improvement In the
conduit of the state department
was due not only to the more
thorough and equitable enforce-
ment and administration of law
but to the improvement of the
laws themselves that the secre
tary of state has to enforce.
"I only quote from official re
ports signed by Republican as
well as Democratic members,
hence. Colonel Swanger's contro
versy Is with them, not with me."
THE USUAL WAY
Kansas City Making a Commercla
Transaction of President
Wilson's Visit
As usual, Kansas City has shown
Its thrift and enterprise by commer
clallzhfc the visit of President Wll
son to that place next week on his
speech-making tour. Had he stopped
in St. Joseph the situation would have
been different seats would have been
free.
The visit of the president was taken
as the cue for the sale of the boxes
at the Kansas City Auditorium at $10
per, the receipts to be used to cover
expenses. As, it is usual for all to be
free when a president comes to town
the "thrift" of Kansas City Is all the
more noticeable.
LIFE'S MIRROR
Silently doth time steal away.
The strength, and youth of yesterdiy
Life's mirror reveals, to matron and
maid,
The toll to time by each paid.
And dare we pause, In life's mac
chase,
For tame, and fortune, a line to erase
The grim old tyrant, Want,
Stalks in, tall and gaunt.
So bravely onward man mu&t go,
Or linger, as the laggard here below
Till time reveals him, tunloved, un
known, '
Save for his faithful dog alone.
Until he meets the reaper grim,
To banter, beat or cheat him,
Or succumb to his cold embrace,
Till time his memory shall efface.
There to rest, or roam,
None reveal the mystery of this last
home.
Though thy spirit, Pagan or Christian
be.
Savage or crone of Witchery.
Through the tranquil rest of ages.
Before history marred life's pages;
Earth's sojourn of toil and strife,
Gave promise of eternal life.
But, call thy dead, In terms endearing,
Or rant and rave, In frenzied grief.
The silent stare, the cold embrace,
Of death, naught can efface.
Save time; racing through all life,
Leaving a carnage of Joy and strife
Though three scoru and ten, be thy lot
among,
Earth's trials, thy death knell, was at
the cradle rung.
Flaunt n$t. thy vanity, In the face of
time
Or boast of thy prowess, while In thy
prlntt,
For tlmi Is thy master, thou his
humllo slave..
E'en novj he stands beckoning at thy
open grave.

HERE 15 EVIDENCE
RIGHT AT
President Forbes of the First
National Is the Authority,
and He Is Conservative
MONEY WAS NEVER
BEFORE SO PLENTIFUL
And as a Result the Greatest Era of
Prosperity In the History of the
Country Is On to Stay for at Least
Two Years Longer, According to the
Testimony of One of St. Joseph's
Best-Known Bankers and Financiers
For months past we have believed
It as has every business man who
noted the evidence.
For months past this paper has said
that there was prosperity under the
guidance of President Wilson and a
Democratic administration.
For months past this has been dis
puted by the Republican calamity
howlers and the curb-stone Republican
orators and spellbinders, who only
seek office and care not what they
say or do in order that they might
achieve such a blissful result for
them.
For months and more than months
that pillar of light, the only St. Jo
seph Gazette, has "howled and bawled
Itself hoarse and into a sick ward,
telling of the want and destitution in
the United States the lack of work
for the unemployed and the "general
depression" all over the country all
caused from the fact that "Wilson
and the Democratic party are in the
saddle."
And for months it has kept up its
stories of depression and religiously
excluded from its news columns all
mention of prosperity and the return
ing activity of the laboring classes.
And now it has slipped a cog there
is no other explanation for it for
without a slip no such story as that
of Tuesday morning would have
adorned its front page.
That Slipped Cog
And this is where the slipped cog
comes In. President R. T. Forbes of
the First National bank of this city,
who is also president of the local
branch of the National Security
League, teturned Monday from Wash
ington where he attended the league's
national convention, and also from a
business tour of the financial district
of New York. And he is the man
who has curdled all of the milk In
The Gazette's coroanut.
And the best part of the story of
the slipped cog Is that Mr. Forbes,
who Is one of the most observing fi
nanciers of the Middle West, Is not a
Democrat, and therefore does not
speak from a Democratic standpoint
but simply as a cool-headed, con
servative business man.
Heretofore whenever any Demo
cratic paper In this section has print
ed (and with truth) any story of
ptosperity or of the prosperous condi
tions of the country, that publication
at once acquired the hostility of the
erudite Gazette and was promptly
challenged for the proof and simply
because the offender had not the vis
ible evidence to show, the stories it
printed were derided and ridiculed by
The Gazette and placed in the fairy
story column for further Juggling
later on. And here again must ref
erence be made to that "slipped cog."
Banker Forbes' Words
It Is hardly believed possible that
The Gazette will dispute Banker
Forbes'' words and still less will it
dispute them when they appear on the
front page a la scare-head of The Ga
zette itself. Now Just read what the
steemed Gazette said on its front
page Tuesday morning:
Forbes was greatly Impressed with
the conditions In New York, where he
visited prior to going to Washington.
"The extravagance in New York at
the present time is terrific," he said.
"1 have never seen anything like It.
It surpasses the palmy days when
Harry Thaw and other Plttsbu-gers
went to New York with money made
in the steel mergers. Cafes and hotelB
are crowded every night to capacity,
and business in the retail district Is
booming. Most of It Is due to the
huge war order profits, but some
comes from the general prosperity In
the country. The one redeeming fea
ture Is that this new wealth will soon
find distribution through several chan
nels into every Industry and business
In the country."
And Still Some More
And then, as if to add more weight
to this undlsputable testimony for

FOITIK PLEADS GUILTY
Former St. Joseph Man Owns Up To
An Embezzlement of Six
Thousand Dollars
Vladimir D. Foitik, formerly of this
city where he was well known, but
lately a fugitive from Justice until
two months ago, on Friday pleaded
guilty to a charge of embezzling
$0,000 from the Live Stock National
Bank of Omaha. The plea was made
In the federal court, but sentence wan
deferred by Judge Munger on account
of the dangerous Illness of the de
fendant's father, A. A. Foitik, who for
over a quarter of a century was con
nected with the Merchants Bank of
this city.
Young Foitik absconded with the
money, according to the Information
against him, a little more than a year
ago. He went to Australia, but re
turned because he wanted to see his
baby, and surrendered himself to the
authorities. Sentence was deferred
until March 4. Foitik is at liberty on
bond in the meantime.
A NEW RICHMOND
Earle H. Spellman Will Probably Be
the Only Republican Candi
date for Sheriff
Of course the gophites of this coun
try full well realize that It is no use
for them to put out a candidate for
sheriff, as that desirable place natur
ally and logically goes to some good
Democrat, but of course that does not
prevent the members of the grand old
pawty from putting out a candidate to,
if nothing else, keep up the party
organization.
In casting about for a candidate to
pull off the running stunt, the "search
ing committee" has uncovered Earle
H. Spellman, the well-known restaur
ant man of 418 Felix street, and they
are now using their blandishments in
unlimited degree to Induce him to
come out and make the race. Spell
man Is a real good fellow and knows
how to conduct a model eating house,
but when it comes to running for
sheriff against good Democrats, such
as abound here well that's another
story-
THE GOOD MAN
There's a good man walks down our
street,
But I don't know his name,
Ner where he lives, ner where he
goes
He's a good man, Jes' the same.
Once when our street was slippery
A woman thin an' old
Came draggln' 'long a load o' wash,
Too heavy fer f hold.
The good man 'et goes down our street
Came by: without demur
He lifted up her load o' wash
An' carried it fer her.
The old woman toddled after, an
I know she blessed that same
Good man 'et walks down our street,
though
She didn't know his name.
L. Duncan Cox.
THEY VISITED THE PRESIDENT
While the effort was being made to
Induce President Wilson to visit St.
Joseph, Mr. Louis T. Goldlng of The
News-Press contributed his part, as
the following, sent out by the Asso
ciated Press that day, discloses. The
dispatch said:
The president first had not planned
to speak in St. Joseph, but L. T. Gold
lng. publisher of the St. Joseph News
Press, and Representative Booher
called at the White house today and
urged that a short speech, at least, be
made there. It Is known that the
president expects to make one of the
"keynote" speeches of Ms trip at Kan
sas City, where he will deal largely
with the cry of militarism that has
been raised against the preparedness
program.
MORE PROSPERITY
The American Locomotive Works
Cited At An Example To
Calamity Howlers
Just as another little prosperity
Item, the Republican calamity howlers
are requested to read this statement
of the American Locomotive Works.
See how H digests:
New York. Jan. 25. The half-year
statement of the American Locomo
tive company, which was issued to
day, shows an Increase in gross earn
ings of $9,039,630 for the six months
ending Dec. 31, 1915, as compared with
the corresponding period In 1914. The
total for the last six months ot 1915
was $14.39S.S59. The statement also
shows that the company had on Its
books on Jan. 1, 1910, unfilled orders
amounting to $52,240,000.
How about this Is It an Indication,
or Is the fact that they have over
$52,000,000 worth of work ahead a
forerunner ot "Industrial stagnation"?
