?ith the nearer approach or
Spring, indications are multiplying
of preparations for active campaigning
on the various fronts. Such autual
fighting as is going on. however,
while localy important as that In
France and Belguim, Is apparently
not Indicative of the beginning us yet
of any operations on a large scale.
The situation in the Balkans contlnues
to excite marked Interest and
there is Increasing attention being
given to developments In connection
with Greece. The Allies for their
part have made o new move In making
a alndlng on the Karaburum
peninsula near the bead of the gulf
of Salonlkl, occupying the Greek
forts there. The move seems to havo
been dictated by strategic reasons
it being considered undesirable by
the Entente forces to have the positions
in other hands than their own.
As to Greece itself a despatch from j
Teutonic sources carries the intimation
that King Constantine and his
close advisers fear that it may be
dragged into the war eventually
through the Influence of former Premier
Venizelos with the Greek people,
the Idea of a revolutionary
movement of a grave character not
being absent from the mind of his
ruler.

(Communicated.)
We heartily approve of the work
done by our county agent, W. D.
Zlnn. IT the Information and Instructions
given to the farmers
cculd be followed, Harrison county
would soon pivduce sufficient feed
for home consumption, with the single
exception of wheat and possibly
of that a few years later. The necessary
expense per acre would be as
follows:
One ton of lime per acre
costing $ 7.00
500 pounds acid phosphate. . 3.50
Grass seed of different kinds 1.00
Labor, per aero 1.00
Making a total of $12.50
Unfortunately the farmer whose
lands are most Impoverished is tbe
fanner who has no money with
which to resuscitate his land. The
farms of Harrison county have never
yielded six per cent on their taxable
value and the farmers cannot paysix
per cent on money to add to the
value of his land, for If he increases
Its value he also increases his taxes.
Cheap money is what we need, and
while the agricultural bureaus of the
United States and also of this state
are doing some good work In our
behalf, we don't think anything
could be done that would be so great
an advantage to us as to furnish
cheap currency with which to reinstate
our worn out lands. Could we
get money at one per cent per annum,
giving a first mortgage to the
amount of say 40 per cent on the taxable
value of. our land, that mortgage

proposition might look chimerical to
some people, even farmers, but stop
and think what the United States
does do for the national bank's. The
United States pays the national
banks two per cent or 4 per cent per
annum to take money to loan to us
at six per cent. If a national bank
Is founded on a 2 per cent bond, the
bond is first bought. Then the bond
Is deposited in the treasury at Washington
where it draws two per cent
per annum and the full amount of
the bond Is furnished to the bank In
currency to loan to Its customers. If
the bank Is founded on a four per
cent bond, the government pays the
bank four per cent to accept currency
to loan to the people. If the
United States would furnish us with
money at one per cent, It would be at
least three per cent, possibly five per
cent more to its advantage than its
present system of furnishing its
money through its banking system.
One per cent would pay all expenses
of examining titles and taking mortgages.

Announces for Chief.
The, first gun I nthe political fight
preceding the city primaries, which
are to be held Tuesday, March 7, was
fired Saturday morning when Mayor
G. H. Gordon announced his candidacy
for re-election. The mayor
trained his forty-two centimeter mortars
on his opponents with the statement
that he was "running on his
record."
Ther was a report in political circles
that J. T. Swager, city councilman
from the Third ward, would
oppose Mayor Gordon at the primaries.
The mayor said that he understood
Mr. Sv.liger was to be a
candidate.
Chief of Police Harry L. Brooks
also announced his candidacy for reelection
this morning. It was said In
some quarters that Thomas Anderson,
former city councilman, would
be a candidate for chief of police,
but the report was not confirmed.
The announcements followed the
enactment by the city council Friday
night of an ordinance provldng for
the holding of a city primary election
on the first Tuesday In March, and
stipulating that all candidates for
municipal offices shall enter the race
before next Saturday night.
Although there were no other announcemnts
by prospective candidates,
numerous persons were suggested
as In reality being In the race
for other city offices. There are a
large number of candidates for the
Republican nomination of city clerk,
according to reports in political circles.
Among those, who, it is said,
will shortly nnnounce their candidacies

E. J. Doyle, for many years street
superintendent, is the only person
