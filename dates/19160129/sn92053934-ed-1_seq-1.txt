LANSING DENIES
REPORT MADE ON
LUSITANIA CASE
Washington, D. C, Jan. 29 Secre-
tary Lansing today denied published
reports that the United States had
given Germany until Feb. 5 to make a
definite answer on whether it intends
uic mcj siwu miia ur
the neutrals who were lost. On this
point the state department is under
stood to be firm.
Secretary Lansing flatly denied that
any date had been set as the limit for
Germany's reply.
While all officials are declining to
discuss the Lusitania negotiations, the
impression prevails among those who
are in a position to know of the pro
gress of the exchanges that Germany
has been Informed that the United
States wants the controversy settled
without unnecessary delay.
The continued failure to close up the

a degree of seriousness which, how
ever, could not be described as criti
cal. Pittsburgh, Pa., Jan. 29 Advisers of
President Wilson, while denying that
a time limit had been set for Ger
many's reply, indicated that the presi
dent and Secretary Lansing were de
termined that the Lusitania case be
settled as quickly as possible.
It was understood that no further
definite steps on the part of the United
States would bo taken until after the
president returns to Washington on

WaitReplies
to Proposal
on Sub Pact
Washington, Jan. 29. Administra
tion officials are awaiting advices of
how the proposal of the United States
to all the belligerent countries regard
ing submarine warfare has been re
ceived in the capitals of the warring
countries.
In announcing that incidental notes
had been sent -to-all-the belligerent
countries. Secretary Lansing said that
the countries had been asked whether
they were willing to subscribe to a
declaration of principles governing at
tacks on merchant ships and forbid
ding the arming of such vessels.
Government officials said today that
favorable responses would clinch the
principles of submarine warfare for
which the United States has long con
tended. It was explained that the
notes were sent purely in the interest
of humanity and in an effort to es
tablish in international law a policy
disposing of many problems arising
from submarine warfare.
The United States proposes that
non-combatants may expect protection
under the rules of international law
and the principles of humanity when
traveling on merchant ships, that
warning must be given before a mer
chantman is attacked, that belligerent
owned merchant ships must obey
warnings to stop, that merchantmen
shall not be fired on except in case of
resistance or flight, that no merchant
man shall be sunk except where it is
impossible to supply a prize crew or
until passengers and crew are placed
in safety and that merchantmen shall
not be permitted to mount arms.
HIGHER WATERS
DUE IN ARKANSAS
Little Rock, Ark., Jan. 29. The Mis
sissippi river, already 10 feet above
flood stage at Arkansas City, will go
still higher by Feb. 10, and the crests
of the floods in the Arkansas and
White rivers will be held back, accord
ing to predictions here on the duration
of the floods in this state.
River men and weather records say
that, not for a quarter of a century has
there been so much water as at present
in all the streams of the state.
Rain that fell throughout the state
last night added tn the rlancpr horansn
j of the previous two days almost inces
sant precipitation.
The crest of the flood in the Arkan
sas river is expected to reach Little
Rock Sunday. The stage of 27 feet
predicted here will be the highest on
record and will inundate portions of
Argenta, on the north bank of the
Arkansas across from this city. The
stage of 29 feet predicted for Pine Bluff
will send the water high over the
levees, starting at Cummings, the state
prison farm.
No loss of life, except that of F. H.
Fuller, salesman of Fort Wayne, Ind.,
drowned near Clinton on the Cadron
river yesterday, had been reported to
day. Watson is entirely inundated.
Launches and rowboats are plying in
the streets. Rail communication with
the town has been entirely cut off, but
a relief committee has been formed to
handle the situation.

CHAMPIONS FOR
BRANDEIS SURE
OF CONFIRMATION
Washington, Jan. 29. President
Wilson's nomination of Louis D. Bran-
Ideis of Boston to fill the vacancy on
the supreme bench caused by the death
of Associate Justice Lamar, continued
an absorbing topic of discussion at the
capitol today.
The nomination was a surprise both
in congressional and official circles,
j inasmuch, asMr. Brandeis' name had
nor Deen menuonea in connection witn
the place, -i
Senators generally were unwilling
to express themselves publicly on the
subject. .Some said, however, that they
were opposed to the nomination, while
others approved it. Champions of Mr.
Brandeis apparently were confident of
confirmation.
The nomination will not be taken up
formally until Monday when the sen
ate judiciary committee, to which it
has been referred, meets. A subcom
mittee will then be appointed to con
sider the nomination and make a re
port. If talk of opposition amounts to
anything it will develop in the com
mittee. ENGLISH APPROVE

POLICE PLOT
IS BARED BY
BANDIT GANG
Confessions of Bank Rob
bers Implicate Politicians
and City Officials.
GUNMEN ARE IMPORTED
Claim Thugs Being Brought
From New York to Ter
rorize Chicago.
Chicago, Jan. 29. Six Indict
ments charging robbery were re
turned today against four of the
men accused of robbing the Wash
ington Park ational bank of $15,
000 in a spectacular holdnp Thurs
day morning.
'o indictment was returned
against the fifth man, Eddie Mack,
who the police say was the leader
of the robbers, and from whom a
complete confession was obtained.
Chicago, Jan. 29. Charges that
criminals are being brought from New
York and other cities to commit crimes
in Chicago for the purpose of discred
iting the state's attorney's office and
the city administration is to be investi
gated by a special grand jury, accord
ing to police officials.
In an alleged confession, made pub
lie last night by the police, Eddie
Mack, a notorious pickpocket and
charged with leading the bandits who
robbed the Washington Park National
bank of $15,000, is said to have re
vealed a pl(t to discredit both city
and county officials and members of
the police department.
Gunmen Imported. .
It was generally known among
crooks that imported gunmen were go
ing after Captain Hunt, chief of de
tectives, and Maclay Hoyne, state's
attorney of Cook county, "because
they were after the crooks," Mack is
alleged by the police to have said.
"Certain politicians and polic"6 of
ficials are bringing them into town,"
Mack is reported to have added.
According to the state's attorney's
office at least six police officers are
implicated by Mack's confession, in
which he is quoted as naming several
as "fixers" for criminals and as hav
ing accepted money for the protection
of law breakers. Several police offi
cers recently were convicted on sim
ilar charges.
Assistant State's Attorney Frank
Johnson Jr., said today the grand Jury
would be asked to return immediately
indictments against Mack, Charles and
Henry Kramer, Alex Brodie and Harry
Fein, who were taken into custody
yesterday charged with the robbery.
Involved In Murder!
The jury, Mr. Johnson said, also
would investigate the possibility that
the men were involved in the robbery
of the Cook tourist agency and the re
sultant murder of Policeman Bror
Johnson. He said that should this
connection be proven and also that
certain policemen and politicians had
allowed the criminals to work in Chi
cago, charges of accessory before the
fact to the murder of Policeman John
son would be lodged against them.
With the alleged confession of Mack
and the Kramer brothers that they
robbed the Washington Park bank, the
authorities today were paying great
est attention to reputed importation of
criminals to discredit the administra
tion. The Kramers were quoted as
having said they were intimates of the
"Rosenthal murderers in New York.
Held for Rosenthal Death.
According to Charles Kramer, the
brothers were taken into custody by
New York police shortly after the mur
der in July, 1912, of Herman Rosen
thal. They were found, he said, in the
room of Harry Horowitz, known to the
New York authorities as "Gyp, the
Blood" and they were held while the

GIVE ASSURANCE
IN VERONA CASE
Washington, Jan. 29 Italy has
rtven assurances that guns mounted
' on the liner Verona are for defensive
purposes only and the state depart
ment today ruled there was no objec
tion to permitting the Italian liner to
clear. The New York customs au
thorities were Instructed to clear the
Bhip.
No decision has been reached as to
the Italian liner America which also
has guns but she will be permitted to
. sail, if the same assurances are given.
THE WAR TODAY
Offensive movements on a large
scale by the Germans are reported
today by Berlin. Numerous at
tacks were made on the French
lines and at two places these are
declared to have been pierced for
considerable distances.
The chief success apparently
was south of the Somme, against
the village of Frise, on the Somme
canal, the capture of which is
claimed by the Germans, together
with 1,000 yards of trenches sonth
of the Tillage.
Northeast of XeuTlIIe, in the sec
tor near Souchez which was the
scene of the allied advance in
northern France late last Septem
ber, the storming of 1,500 yards of
trenches is announced.
In these operations Berlin
claims the capture of more than
eleven hundred prisoners and 22
machine guns.
According to the Paris Tersion
of the attacks ont of Somme, the
offensive was pressed by the Ger
mans along a front of several kilo
metres, but broke down complete
ly on the northern end. It is ad
mitted, however, that the assault
was successful against the Tillage
of Frise, on the bank of the
Somme. Berlin concedes the occu
pation by the French of a mine
crater near Meuville, but declares
that near Aras a group of houses
was stormed and taken from the
French occupants.
Fighting of Tarious degrees of
violence continues along the east
em, western, Austrian and Cau
casus fronts.
In the Artois district on the
west, artillery battles of a Tiolent
character are in progress and in
the vicinity of JieuTille, infantry
attacks have resulted in heavy
losses to both French and Ger
mans. On the east, artillery and in
fantry attacks are being made by
the Russians and the Teutonic al
lies over almost the entire line
from Riga to Bukowina.
The Hussions report the defeat
of a large party of Teutons near
Galicla, many being killed.
Dispatches from Kiev say that
Austria and Germany are rushing
large quantities of artillery to the
front in order to stop any advance
into Gallcia by the .Russians.
The Italians have recaptured
some ground west of Gorlzia which
the Austrians recently took and
have repulsed Uie Austrians in the
upper Isor.zo. The losses of the
latter were heavy.
Petrograd reports the defeat of
a large Turkish force and the cap
ture of prisoners and supplies
south of Lake I'rumiah, Persia.
Russian correspondents on the
western front have sent word to
Petrograd that the Germans are
reported to be making a new 22
inch gun for use in the spring
campaign.
With the nearer approach of
spring, Indications are multiplying
of preparations for active cam
paigning on the various fronts. The
sitnatlon in the Balkans continues
to excite marked interest. The al
lies hare made a new move in
making a landing on the Karabu
run peninsula, near the head of
the Gnlf of Saloniki, occupying the
Greek fort there.. The move seems
to have been dictated by strategic
reasons, it being considered unde
sirable by the entente forces to
have the position in other hands
than their own.
A dispatch from Teutonic
sources carries the intimation that
King Constantine and his advisers
,fear Greece may be dragged into
the war eventually through the in
fluence of former Premier Yenize
los with the Greek people, the idea
of a revolutionary movement of a
grave character not being absent
from the minds of the ruler and
his civil and military aides.
Confidentially there is talk of an
advance on Saloniki contemplated
by the Teutons and that Turkish
forces notably the Gallipoli army,,
are moving to a position where
they will be ready to participate in
the attack.
Although it is reported from
Athens that the Italians have de
termined to abandon Durazzo on
the Albanian coast, owing to the
difficulties presented to its defense
against the Austrians there are re
ports from southern Albania more
favorable to the allies.

Cheering Throngs Greet the
President on His Arrival
in Pittsburgh.
CLEVELAND NEXT STOP
Is Urged to Speak to Those
Unable to Hear His
Formal Address. ,
Pittsburgh, Pa., Jan. 29. President
Wilson, opening here today his six-day
program of speaking in the middle
west on national preparedness, told a
throng which packed Memorial hall
that the test of national preparedness
lay not with congress but with the
young men of the country in their
answer to the call to volunteer and
their employers who should oppose no
obstacle to free response.
"And I, for one," the president said,
believe both the young men and the
employers will do their duty.
"And I am not afraid that America
will not do enough. I am only earn
estly desirous that she should be very
coolly considerate of What she does.
One cool judgment is worth a thou
sand hasty counsels."
Pittsburgh, Pa., Jan. 29. President
Wilson reached Pittsburgh at 9:40 a.
m. today to make the first speech of
his middle west tour in favor of na
tional preparedness.
The president's special stopped at a
station four miles from the city proper
so that he might elude the crowd which
the police felt would be awaiting him
at the Union station. A scattering
crowd cheered him as he rode in a
sprinkle of ri-in through the streets.
After reaching, the hotel, the presi
dent and his wife held an informal re
ception to which were bidden some of
the city's leading men, and two men
who had been appointed to accompany
Mrs. Wilson to Soldiers' Memorial
hall where the president was due to
begin his address at 1 o'clock.
Lunch In Seclusion.
The president and Mrs. Wilson
lunched in their suite in keeping with
their pre-determined plan not to at
tend any public luncheons or dinners
during the tour.
Notwithstanding the unusual activ
ities of yesterday in Washington and the
fact that he had spent three consecu
tive nights on the train, the president
rose refreshed. Dr. Cary T. Grayson,
the White House physician, said Mr.
Wilson was in good condition for the
activities of the week ahead. These
include addresses at Cleveland to
night, Milwaukee Monday, Chicago
Monday night, Des Moines Tuesday
night, Topeka Wednesday afternoon,
Kansas City Wednesday night, St.
Louis Thursday mprning and many
brief addresses from the rear plat
form of his car in smaller towns.
Urged for "Overflow Speech."
Cleveland, Ohio, Jan. 29. Chamber
of Commerce officials and William F.
Flynn, chief of the United States sec
ret service were in communication
today with President Wilson in an ef
fort to arrange for him to speak to an
overflow meeting after his scheduled
address on national defense before the
Chamber of Commerce tonight.
Chief Flynn, on his arrival here,
learned that thousands of persons who
wished to hear the president speak
will be unable to do so unless an over
flow meeting Is held. It is hoped the
president will consent to talk for a
few minutes from the balcony of a
downtown hotel.
Hall Is Packed.
Pittsburgh, Pa., Jan. 29. Half an
hour before the president was due to
speak, Memorial hall was packed with
4.000 persons and a crowd of several
thousand was standing at the doors
outside. It appeared as if many would
