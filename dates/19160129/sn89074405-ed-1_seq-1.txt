LAYMEN'S MET

Sunday Will See Close of
Greatest Religious Gath

(Herald Special Service.)
Fargo, N. D., Jan. 29.—The greatest
religious gathering ever held in the
northwest, the Laymen's Missionary
convention, reached a great climax
yesterday. The records of all pre
vious Convention of this *erles of 75,
which are being held in all parts of
the nation this year, has been broken
in several respects. When the con
vention closed last night 1M cities
outside of Fargo and Moorhead were
represented. This surpasses. Boston,
Mass., which up to the time held the
record with 96 outside towns In which,
however, suburbs outside the eorpor
ate limits of the city were counted
as outside towns. At the sametlme
the registration numbered 1,267,
which outstrips the reoords of conven
tion cities several times the else of
Fargo. The First Methodist church
now holds the record of having more
men registered than any church in
any convention thus far held.
The program was all that it had
been advertised. There was not'a dull
moment from the opening of the first
session. The singing of Naftsger was
superb Dr. Herbert Johnson carried
the audience with htm every step as
he told of the perils to Christianity
In ease-loving America today James
McNaughton held the audience spell

Repeated Efforts to Induce

NESTOS TO ENTER
SENATORIAL RACE
Alliance With Gronna Near
—Working to Get John
son Out.
United States Senator LaFollette
has flatly refused to withdraw from
the North Dakota presidential prefer
ence election of March 21. despite ef
forts, made particularly by the Cum
mins people, and by many of his own
supporters in this state.
The refusal of LaFollette to with
draw, which first came to the front
at the recent meeting of the North
Dakota Progressive Republican league
in Fargo, has been followed by a fur
ther refusal on his part to give Cum
mins a clear field.
Cummins Men Go Home.
Messrs. Clark and Rawson of Des
Moines, who have been handling the
North Dakota situation for Cummins,
spent several days in the state this
week, looking over the situation. They
returned to Des Moines, however,
without making any definite an
nouncement of their plans, only de
claring their Intention of consulting
further with Senator Cummins.
Cummins supporters in North Da
kota are practically of one mind as
to what step should be taken, they
being opposed to any participation in
the primaries if LaFollette insists
upon making the race. They maintain
that Cummins would be the second
choice of any North Dakota delega
tion that might be chosen, hence the
state's strength would ultimately go
to Cummins In the event that LaFol
lette's chances were found without
hope.
It is understood that the Cummins
forces in Washington have been ex
tremely active this week In an effort
to secure LaFollette's withdrawal
from the North Dakota primaries, but
they concede the task is hopeless.
Hie Senatorial Tangle.

torshlp nomination in the republican
primaries le, now generally iacc^pted,

R. A.
It Is this feature that commands the
attention of Gronna at present, and
it is certain to have a big Influence
in the coming election.
Just Two Candidates.
There is little likelihood of a third
candidate' entering the race for the
democratic national committee berth,
with H. H. Perry of EHlendale and
John Bruegger of Williston as such
candidates.
Both are already actively engaged
in their campaign, and no little bitter
ness has been developed among their
supporters.
Ilia recent reported endorsement
by the Traill county democratic cen
tral committee of Perry's candidacy
has evoked the reply from Bruegger
forces that such endorsement really
has no basis, for there were only six
members of the committee at the
meeting.
Marshall In Again.
Thomas Marshall, It is generally
accepted, will become a candidate for
the position he now holds—that of
national committeeman for the re
publican party.
While' Wm. Lemke of Fargo has
the endorsement of the North Da
kota Progressive Republican league
for the national committee job, and
it la currently reported that he will
make the race, there are elements
entering Into the situation that may
bring about his withdrawal.
Among a certain class of republi
cans it is maintained that Lemke has
been associated for years with the
democratic party, and they are not
willing to now accept him as their
national representative.

In taking this matter up with

that they are making earnest efforts
to restore traffic.
The mayor of Ambrose said today
that stormB have been almost con

a constant snowfall, with nearly three

In several of the Montana towns
affected, which include Westby, White

conditions as relating to fuel are seri

efforts to bring in supplies from other
towns on paralleling railroads of other
companies. This method of hauling,
however, is expensive and almost pro
hibitive, because of the tremendous
snowbanks piled up everywhere.

Washington, Jan. 29.—Secretary

On this point the state department

Paris, Jan. 29.—Parts newspapers
are quoting prominently excerpts from
the interview yesterday of David
Lloyd-George, minister of munitions,
with a London correspondent of The
Milan Seco! in which the minister is
quoted as* saying that the allies are
only just beginning, and that they are
gaining now, while Germany Is weak
ening. Some of the excerpts follow:
Will Have 4,000,000 Men.
"We have at present 3,000,000 men
under arms," said Lloyd-George, "and
by spring we shall have 4,000,000 sol
diers, fit and well equipped. This is
a democratic year. If it was not' I
should have nothing to do with it. I
was opposed to the last war that Eng

Sees No (Difficulty.
"I foresee no difficulty," continued
the minister, "In connection with
compulsion. No fewer than 6,000,000
men came forward to enlist. Some
of them were unfit for service, others
were required for the munitions fac
tories, for the railroads and for the
mines. About 380,000 men are affect
ed by the compulsory military-service
measure, but this number is diminish
ing through daily attestations.
"Do not be under any misappre
hension," said Lloyd-George further.
England Determined.
"Great Britain is determined to
push the war to the end. We may
make mistakes, but we never will give
in. It was British stubbornness which
overthrew Napoleon after twenty
years of war.
"Our allies then fell away one by
one and England alone held on. This

resolute as we are."
