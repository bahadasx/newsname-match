FEEDSTUFF SALES
rUJRG SHORT
A. and M. College Expert Says Falling
Off la Due to Crop Diversi-ficatlon.
That nirh fruit la being borne by
the campaign for crop diversification
waged ao assiduously lait year In
Toxaa la evidenced by tbe IIkIiI aalei
of feedstuffa In Texaa this year. Ao
cording to Jamea Sullivan, executive
secretary of the feed control service,
administered Jrora the agricultural
experiment station at the A. and M.
College, the sale of tags to mills out
side of Texaa has been reduced to al
most nothing. Indicating a wholesome
condition on Texaa farms relatives to
fed supplies for livestock.
"Texaa rained feed la being fed In
thla state to an unprecedented ex
tent." said Mr. Sullivan In discussing
the sale of taxi to foreign mills. "More
than that much Texaa feed haa been
shipped from thla state to lire atock
growers and mills In other atatea.
"During the season of 191415 many
thousand taga were shipped out of the
atate to feed manufacturers. Thla
year exceedingly few taga have been
shipped to mills of other statea. sell
ing feed In Texas. Moreover the taga
shipped to Texas mills have shown a
big decrease. Indicating that the Tet
aa farmer Is feeding his stock at home
thla year, whether he la feeding his
family at home or not.
"The feed control service haa ex
perienced much trouble thla year
with cotton aeed meal manufacturera.
Practically SO per cent of the cotton
seed meal and rake offered for aale
thla season haa been ot Inferior qua).
Ity. The feed control service haa re.
quired many of the mills to register
their product aa cotton aeed meal
and hulla and aa cotton aeed rake and
hulla. showing the percentage of meal
or cake and the percentage ot hulls
present on the tag. together with oth
er required Information. A number
of complaints have been filed and
quite a few millers have pleaded
guilty to misrepresentation in label
ling and have paid tinea.
'The purpose of the feed control
service la to protect the Interest of
the feeder aa well aa the Interests of
the honest miller. The tag must ex
plain the composition of the feed.
Feeders should learn the feeding value
of the various food elements and
ahould make a careful study of the
tag on all of the feed they buy. In or
der that they may get just what they
pay for."
Tho feed control service maintains
a system of Inspection by which from
time to time tbe products of all Texaa
mills are lnaected to determine
whether the standards of the feed con
trol are being met In the composition
ot feeds and the tagging of theae feeds.
