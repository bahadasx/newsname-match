MRS. MOHR OFFERS
HUSBAND'S LETTER
IN HER DEFENSE
In Note to Relative Doctor De
clared That His Wife Was
a "Good Woman."
BRAVES LAST ATTACK.
Denies She Ever Admitted
That Her Conduct Had
Been Improper.
(Speolal from n Staff Correspondent
of The Evenino Wo-!H.)
PROVIDKNCI3, It. I., Jan. 2D. Mrs.
Kllzaboth Tiffany Mohr to-day nn
Ished her own task in her trial for
tho murder of her husband and loft
the stand. She left without having
collapsed under tho strain of tho In
quiry, contrary to mrfst expectations.
Many of her frlcndsookod, hour after
hour, for her breakdown."'
Herons she left tho etand to-day
she helped deliver ono blow to the
State's case. This was on the mat
ter of a letter which Dr. Mohr had
written to Kugeno Sullivan of Fall
lllver, Mrs. Mohr'n brother-in-law,
March 5, 190!. In his own hand Dr.
Mohr wroto "Kllaibcth has a perfect
right to siipposo sho was married,"
when she went through a ceremony in
Hrooklyn. Tho State claimed this
marriage was Illegal, that there was
no ceremony.
"I am writing In defense of a good
woman at prcsont," was ono of tho
sentences In tho letter, the words ut
present'' forming tho baso for an ut
tack on Mrs. Mohr by tho .State's
attorneys. Sho wild sho didn't know
what Dr. Mohr meant, ami denied It
referred in any way to her relations
with other men.
The State fought to keep the letter
from th records, but once It was In,
sought to tear It In tatter.s It bent
particular energy toward learning tlm
meaning of another bonteneo of tho
doctor's: "What I contended she now
admits; and Hint is thu caiihc of our
piesent differences." Mrs. Mohr
stoutly denied knowing the contents
and admission, declaring that her
husband could not have meant any
thing derogatory of her, as she had
been tho saving of hlin.
Dr. John P. Morrlssev ami Dr.
Henry H. Moore, Internes at the
Ithotlo Island Hospital, where Dr.
Mohr anil Miss llurger wern tnkon

Dr. Mnrrlssoy Instilled ho had not

When Mrs. Mohr took tho stand she
w.ih first questioned hy William II.

negro who confessed that his bullet
