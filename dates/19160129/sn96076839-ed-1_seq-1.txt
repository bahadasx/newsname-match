Two of the bonds have been estreated
and $300.00 collected thereon, which
has been turned into the county
treasury.
Cases where warrants have been
issued but were not served, or dismiss
ed before examination, are not re
ported. ELBERT BEDE SAYS
The small boy is a mighty big prob
lem for his parents.
Grass widows produce no seed yet
the crop never runs out.
If love wasn't so blind the girl would
see through a lot of the excuses made
by the man.
The man who marries a girl for her
wad quite often finds the interest rate
pretty high.
It's much easier to forgive a person
for a wrong done or a mistake made
when he frankly admits it.
Preachers get on their knees oftener
than others also on their uppers, if
what comic papers say is true.
There is a lot of fun to some people
in being sarcastic but as a business
proposition it is not much of a success.
The person who can make a good
speech is admired almost as much as a
gridiron star and it is not confined to
any certain season.
When a woman makes a man tag
around at the end of her apron strings
he can make up his mind that he has
had something tied to him.
An attempt may be made to show
that an explosion of printers' ink de
stroyed the building of the Los Angeles
Times. Printers' ink has caused great
er ones.
When you see a woman wearing a
aat three times the proper size for her
lead you will usually find that at the
other extreme she wears shoes in re
verse ratio.
When we watch a dignified old hypo
crite parade tilong the street we pic
ture him as he becomes limp as a rag
before the judge who sees the things
beneath that starched outer covering.
An exchange asks: "If it is riht to
per mit a sub-normal infant to die for
l ick of care tuat would have saved its
iife, must we nut, in order to be con
sistent, admit th.it it would be perfect
,v justifiable to withhold the care that
is needed to keep alive all idiots and
nsme v.ud feeble-minded persons?"
That would never do, we have "it to
i.'ive some one to run our newspapers
.VI' U EE I iOKM'.k s;;
Church I 'min i s
i see the wimm:ii of th' cluroh is
iivin" a dinner down tin re in tin Smith
uiklin' today,'" reminded the Si.r to
ie f his. Cl onic s in tin g.ocery store.
I'hem things is the Uggest piece of
foolishness 'at ever was. Aint nobody
makes any money on 'em. It's jist
forty or fifty wimmin 'at won't donate
cash to the church, but '11 lfeWl all over
themselves to git to give two er three
dollars worth a somethin' to eat. Then
they work hard fer a day er two an' git
it ready to cat an' sell it fer about
twenty cents on th' dollar. If they
take in fifty they think they've cleared
a lot of money. Yes sir, I'm agin these
here dinners. Churches don't need the
money any-how."
"I was just getting ready to start
over to dinner," remarked the friend,
but I suppose you'll go home for yours.
"Wall no," replied the Sage. "See
in' as how my wife is over there 'an
give 'em a couple of our best chickeus,
I reckon I ought to patronize 'em,
seems like a waste of money he added,
"to give 'em that much in the fust
place an' then have to pay a quarter
fer your meal."
Brain Workers Live Longest
In a recent discussion of senility and
longevity, Dr. II. M. Friedman reviews
the biological physical and mental
aspects of old age and notes that brain
workers live longer than muscle work
ers and that clergymen are the longest
lived of professional individuals.
Women live longer than men in spite
of the morbidity of childbearing.
Marriage tends to favor longevity and
so does religious life. Heredity is an
improtant factor in both senility and
longevity.
If a man has a wife he always knows
what to do with his money.

And Along Came Ruth
"Oh Ruth, I am afraid these dirty
white gloves will spoil the appearance
of my whole costume," deplored Ruth's
sister as she held them out ruefully in
her hand.
"Give them to me, while you are
dressing, and I will guarantee to have
them looking as good as "hew by the
time you are ready for them," laughed
Ruth.
So she put them on her hands and
carefully went over them with a piece
of moist flannel upon which a little
powdered soap had been sprinkled.
When the dirt had been cleaned off the
gloves, the moisture was removed with
a piece of dry flannel, and when ready
to wear they were just as clean and
smart looking as if they had just come
from the cleaner.
LYMAN HOWE AT
THE TEMPLE THEATRE
Wit will alternate with wisdom in
rapid succession at the Temple Theatre
on Tuesday, February 1st, during the
semi-annual engagement of Lyman II.
Howe's Travel Festival. Also there
will be some real surprises and novel
ties. But the aforesaid wit springs
from the fertile fancies of Howe's
comedy cartoon artists who have cre
ated entirely new film fun to accom
pany the more dignified pictorial trips
to Glacier National Park in northwest
ern Montana and through the Willys-
Overland plant at Toledo to watch an
automobile in the making. Jaunts
abroad will take Howe travelers to
Italy, France, Madeira, Holland, Switz
erland, the Firth of Forth bridge, Scot
land; and even above the clouds via an
aeroplane.

School Commissioner's Notes.
Did Obidiah say that was all talk
about "Standard Schools"? We'll wait
and see, but say while we wail let's
work.
Mid-year examination questions sent
to all rural teachers for the 20th and
21st. The highest average in each
township and the highest average in
the county with the name of the stu
dent in each case will be published in
thie paper as soon as the returns are
in.
The four month certificates for per
feet attendance and punctuality are
being sent out daily now. So far Three
Bells has the banner record, 25 certifi
cates out of 29 belonging.
At the officer's meeting, Mr. Otwell
spent the morning on new points in
school law and the afternoon on the
causes that underlie the movement for
"Standard Schools." This is being
done in every county in the state. In
Emmet county eleven directors im
mediately stepped forward to ask that
their school room be inspected so that
they might know how to proceed at
once.
Did you know, teachers, that Boyne
City faculty is maintaining an exten
sion school? This means that any
teacher and her students will furnish a
program for you free of charge any
time you send for them. If
your noon lunches are cold, if your
recess periods could be filled in with a
little woodwork, basket weaving, or
sewing if your agriculture class do not
realize that they are studing real live
things, and do not understand seed
selection, breeding for types the Bab
cock tester, or farm accounting, why
put it up to the other fellow. Give
Boyne City a chance to help you. Here
is something for nothing only Mr.
Wheator suggests by the way that boys
like refreshments and that a little
music would be all right. They will r
furnish the rest and you may cnarge
admission if you want to, they claim no
dividence untill well that depends a
little bit on the lyceum bureaus.
Farmer's Round-up Institute at Iron
ton, Feb. 4th and 5th. If teachers and
students could both turn out, we would
be glad to call this "Patrons Day."
The entire series of farmer's insti
tutes is the best time ever to talk
"Standard Schools." The commis
sioner is going to use this opportunity
to follow up the circular letter sent
recently to all school officers.
Dr. Bryan sent in the titles to his
three addresees for the teacher's in
stitute for Feb. 17th. We hear that he
is a whole institute in himself.

Long-lived Races
According to English statistics the
Serbs carry off the palm for centenar
ians, there being five hundred and
seventy-five, or one centenarian to
every 22G0 of the population of Serbia.
Ireland stands next in the longevity
list, while Switzerland has not a single
inhabitant living now of the age of one
hundred years.
The average man is miserable be
cause he spends a lot of his time in
making himself think he is.
Experience may be a great teacher,
but a man's experience with a woman
seldom teaches him good sense.
