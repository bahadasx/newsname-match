SAN DIEGO, Jan. 29. Relief parties in automobiles and a pro-
cession of motor trucks departed for stricken Otay valley, fifteen
miles south, where the bursting of the lower Otay dam Thursday
loosed thirteen billion gallons of water upon a streak of arable land
between the hillH and drowned probably fifty persons. Motor trucks
carried provisions for the survivors. Communication with Otay
valley remains severed. San Diego's water supply Is largely from a
system of which the lower Otay dam is a part. It Is curtailed.
"National City and Chula Vista suburbs are reported Bevered from
water sources. The coroner of Otay district says he believes that
many bodies were washed out to sea and never wilf be recovered.
The first of the men forming the relief parties that reached the
Otay valley found .the entire valley devastated by the flood. Six
bodies from south of here were brought to San Diego. Eleven
more were found near the mouth of the Otay river. Reports from
other sections said that five other bodies have been recovered. It
is believed that many more are among debris or were carried out
to sea. It Is believed that the total will be at least fifty dead. The
Tla Juana river is the highest In its history. Tla Juana is under
water. Reports say thut probably many are drowned in Tla Juana.
Measurements showed that a wall of water thirty feet high and
twelve hundred feet wide tore through the valley, sweeping every-
thing before it. The entire dam was carried away. Twenty-seven
houses, all livestock and crops are known to have been carried
away. The Otay river continues on the mmpuge.
