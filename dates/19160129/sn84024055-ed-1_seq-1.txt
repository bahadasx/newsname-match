AN APPEAL, IN BEHALF OF THE BOOKER T. WASHING
TON MEMORIAL FUND OF TWO MILLION DOLLARS,
TO THE COLORED PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES
The Trustees of the Tuskegee Nor
mal ami Industrial Institute are under
taking the task of raising a BOOKER
T. WASHINGTON MEMORIAL FUND
of TWO MILLION DOLLARS in mem
ory of the great American who passed
to his reward, Sunday, November 14,
Ifllo.
Quite properly, the Trustees Have felt
that the " bed-rock' ' of interest in this
effort must rest with the Colored peo
ple, who in their letters to Tuskegee
Institute, following Dr. "Washington's
death, gave such warm assurances of
support, to the end that the work of
Tuskegee Institute may be perpetuated
ami preserved as a permanent memorial
to the man who gave all that he could
give his very life, to the cause of his
people.
The Trustees have requested me to
take eharge of the special campaign
among the Colored people. It is be
lieed that they will welcome the op
portunity of contributing at least $250,
000 as the Trustees and public expect,
as their part of this Memorial Fund.
It has been suggested, in the rais
ing of this Fund, that subscriptions be
united under certain group heads. It
is felt that there are those of the race
who would like to contribute under the
group heads named below: ' -
Group I, $1,000.00; Group H, $500.00
to $1,000.00; Group HI, $250.00 to
jtoOO.00; Group TV, $100.00 to $250.00;
Group V, $25.00 to $100.00; Group VI,
$3.00 to $25.00; Group VII, $1.00 to
$3.00.
I am particularly anxious that every
member of the race be given the op
portunity of contributing as they may
he able toward this Fund. From those
who are not able to give even One Dol
lar ($1.00), any sum which they find
themselves able to give will be accept
ed and gratefully appreciated. For,
after all, the spirit of the gift is as
important as the gift itself.
I am sincerely anxious that all of the
organizations among us shall take a
leading part in this movement, and so
this appeal is directed to
The Bishops, Presidents, and other
officers of our various religious organ
izations; To the Tuskegee Alumni Association
ami the Officers and Members of Tus
kegee Clubs;
Members of the National Negro Press
Association;
The Officers and Members of the Na
tional Negro Business League, as well
as
The OfHecrs and Members of State
ami Local Negro Business Leagues;
The Officers and Members of the Na
tional Negro Medical Association;
The Officers and Members of the Na
tional Association of Colored "Women's
Clubs;
The Officers and Members of the Na
tional Association of Teachers in Col
ored Schools;
The Officers and Members of the Na
tioinl Association for the Advancement
of Colored People;
The Officers and Members of Frater
nal and Secret Society Organizations,

to meet the just expectation of those '
NEW SOCIAL CLUB FORMED.
l's Choisier Thirty young people
met recently at tho home of Maurice
Anderson for the purpose of forming
a l'leasuro club, whose object should
be the fostering of good clean enjoy
ment for our young people. The club
was named Les Choisier (the select
few) and is true to its name in every
rl'ect. A constitution was formed
and officers were elected as follows:
Ir. Maurice Anderson, president; Mr.
Liwrence Alexander, vice-president;
iliss Lulabelle Brock, secretary; Mr.
Hannibal Scurlock, treasurer; Mr. Milo
pewis, Sargent-at-arms; Miss Kather
no Harris, critic; Mr. Paul B. Eaves,
dub reporter.
who are looking to the Colored people,
through this movement, to show their
own interest in perpetuating Dr. "Wash
ington's monument by the preservation
of Tuskegee Institute, and also to show
their appreciation of his labors so un
selfishly rendered in their behalf. It
is hoped that the officers of these or
ganizations will take the forward part
in helping us to arouse and keep alive
interest in this movement by direct ap
peals to their members.
Teachers in schools, both public and
private, are also invited to share the
labors of this effort. To that end they
are requested not only to work up in
terest in the movement, but also to
take a collection from among the chil
dren of the various schools throughout
the country on April 5th, 1916.
It is also earnestly urged that Sun
day, March 12, 1916, be set aside as
a special day upon which to raise a
collection in all the Colored churches
and Sunday-schools throughout the
country toward this Fund.
In order that the machinery and cost
of collection may be reduced to a min
imum, it has been decided by the Trus
tees of the Institute that no agents or
special solicitors shall be appointed,
and that all funds collected be sent di
rectly to, and acknowledged ..from Tus-
kegee Institute. Checks may be drawn I
to the order of "Warren Logan, Treas-
urer, Tuskegee Institute, Alabama, or
to the order of the undersigned.
It shall be our purpose to send to
all of the subscribers to this Fund who
give Five ($5.00) Dollars, or more, a
certificate to be framed, showing Dr.
Washington's picture, a picture of the
home in which he was born, and a
picture of Tompkins Memorial Hall,
the largest building on the Institute
grounds.
Correspondence is invited from all
avIio are interested in this movement,
and the assurance is given that if the
Colored people themselves give $250,
000 of the $2,000,000 to be raised, this
sum will be met more than dollar for
dollar by contributions from White peo
ple interested in the advancement of
the Colored people of the United
States.
The Trustees have decided that out
of the money given by the Colored peo
ple, there shall be erected on the In
stitute grounds a permanent Memorial
to Dr. Wasington's unselfish and useful
life to take the form of a building, a
statue, or a monument of some other
character. The Colored people will thus
have the opportunity not only of con
tributing to the Fund itself, but also
of erecting the Monument which shall
stand on the Institute grounds as "a
memorial of Dr. Washington's sagacity,
of his courage, of his prudence, of his
sclf-forgetfulness, and of his patriotic
service to the Colored people, and to
the people of the United States."
EMMETT J. SCOTT,
Secretary.
Inquiries and correspondence re
specting the Fund being raised by the
Colored people should be addressed to

who passed away this week after a long
A'enerable Bishop B. F. Lee, Senior
Bishop. Dr. Smythe was born in Ul
ster Springs, Jamaica, AV. Indies, in
1869, Feb. 28th, making him 47 years
of age. He came to this country when
21 years of age; entered the Boston
University, remained there one year,
and then went to Montreal, Canada,
where he entered the Montreal Univer
sity, acquiring his Degree of A. B. It
was his fortune to pastor several of
the largest churches in the A. M. E.
connection at Frank, Penn.; Harris
burg, Penn.; Detroit, Michigan; Indi
anapolis, Ind., and Chicago. He was
a member of tho General Board of Mis
sions of the A. M. E. church. During
the last Annual Conference which met
last September in Milwaukee he was
elected Delegate to the next General
Conference, which moets this year in
Philadelphia. He was very favorably
spoken of as one of tho Bishops to be
selected, having for his choice tho Af

It is at all times mighty hard to

of tho women "as the old saying goes
for many of them will love one man
teal hard today and change off to a
fresh one tho next day, AVhite or Black,
and love their new lover much harder
than the old one."
This seems to bo true of Mrs. Viola

Diego, Cal., who has been one of the
prominent social leaders of tiat city

a real Whitelady being in a position
to enjoy all the pleasure that wealth
could command permitted herself to
fall desperately in love with Raymond

sisters, two brothers and several near
relatives to mourn his loss. There were
three things held very dear to him, and
seemingly were the goal of his min

which should always be remembered by
his followers. First, to enlarge Bethel
church; second, to build a home for the
aged members of Bethel church, and
third, to raise the standard and carry
the Gospel of Salvation to God to peo
ple in Africa.
The funeral was in charge and di
