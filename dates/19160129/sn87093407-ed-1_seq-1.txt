WILSON THRILLS
PITTSBURG FOLK
PITTSBURG. Pa. Jan. 29 —
Warning the American people
that "new circumstances have
arisen, foe which the country
must prepare itself," President
Wilson today asked that all
'•tend tb the business of pre
paring—Wat for war, not for ag-
gression—»but for national de-
Cense."
. Thru his speech, there was a
•train grave warning that
peril* may be just ahead. Dan
gers to America he termed
"grave and conatant.'
The struggle abroad has now
lasted a year and a half, he said
"The end is not >«t- and all the
time, thing* are getting more and
more difficult to* handle If all
could see the dispatches 1 read «-v
--ery hour, they would know how dif
ficult It has been to maintain
|>eace."
The president's words stirred
more than 6.000 p< rsons crammed
Into Memorial hall Nearly as
many tri'ire wen- packer! Into the
• econd floor of the building, hoping
that the executive would address
them later Others were herded
along the sidewalks, ietn'sndlng ell

So great wa* the throng that the
president addressed briefly an
overflow meeting
There have been many views
expressed on national defense, he
aald.
Some proceed from sentiment,
and I do not feel free to criticise
a n of these, for this Is a country
of free expres*ton.
I love peace, but peace co*t*
