HOW TO BE POPULAR.
The interesting news is now be
ing detailed by certain partisan
papers friendly to certain big in
terests that President Wilson is
growing so unpopular that his
nomination by democrats would
be unwise. The "unpopular"
items are thus listed:
"Mr. Wilson is unpopular with
the big manufacturers and finan-
ciers of this country.
"Mr. Wilson is unpopular with
those who own property in Mex
ico.
"Mr. Wilson is unpopular with
German-Americans because of his
attitude on the European war.
"Mr. Wilson is unpopular with
British-Americans because of his
attitude on the European war.
"Mr. Wilson is considered in
Europe the most unpopular gov
ernment head in the world."
There is no question of there
being an element of truth in all
these allegations. Mr. Wilson
could have been the most popular
nftn in Germany if he had taken
sides with Germany against Eng
land. Likewise he could have
had the alternative of being the
most popular man in England if
he had taken the English side and
had not required England to come
to time on the shipping and em
bargo questions. In Mexico he
could have had his choice among
the dozen or more factions of be
ing the favorites with them. And
in the United States, Mr. Wilson
could have been as popular with
Wall street interests as was Mr.
Taft if he had only listened to
them and sought their advice on
government policies.
But of the comment against
Wilson, we read not a word from
his detractors as to the attitude
■>f the American-Americans who
live in America and who live FOR
America. Why not give the
views of these American-Ameri
cans who applaud Wilson for
keeping this country out of for
eign entanglements, for forcing
each warring nation to respect our
flag, for forcing Mexico to wash
its own dirty linen, and for forc
ing Wall street to keep its own
nlace and not intrude their sel
fish desires upon the halls of na
tional legislation? All Ameri
can-Americans, regardless of what
may have once been their native
land, are with Wilson in his work
for this, our own country, and
the subsidized press of personal
interests must remember that the
American-American vote is of
some consequence.
SPECIAL INTERESTS
ATTACKED.
The following from the Agri
cultural Grange News, the official
grange paper of this state, is re
quested publication in the Exam
iner for the benefit of the many
readers who are watching the
stand against special interests
taken by the Grangers of Wash
ington :
The following, clipped from the
Philadelphia North American of
Sept. 24, 1915, and the open let
ter by the secretary of the Na
tional Popular Government
League, Washington, D. C, is a
little lengthy, but so important
tiiat 1 hope that it may be read
in every Subordinate Grange in
the state. Patrons, remember
that special interest has no poli
tics. In the national organiza
tion opposing popular govern
ment we find working side by side
such men as William Howard Tat't,
Alton B. Parker, Elihu Boot, Ju
lius C. Burrows and others. Here
in Washington party lines are
never drawn, as was so striking
ly demonstrated in the last legis
lature. When special interest
speaks "the ox knoweth his mas
ter's voice." The contest is not
confined to Washington state
alone. We have our own local
fight, but higher up the contest is
for control of the United States
senate and house of representa
tives. Have you investigated
why and for what purpose Col.
Mulliall was imported to Wash
ington to influence the election of
a United States senator? Turn
hack to your September number
of Agricultural Grange News and
read that article on page 9 and
have these two read in connec
tion.—C. B. Kegley.
Follow-In* is the Item referred to by
Mr. Kogley:
League Chooses Senator Owen
as Champion to Meet Taft, Root
or Parker, Special Privilege
Servants.
Washington, Sept. 23.—Popu
lar grovprnment, as distinct from
the kind of government advocated
by ex-President Taft and by all
supporters of special privilege and
political control in the interest
of the few, will again become an
issue in this country if the Na
tional Popular Government
League can make it one.
The league, through its execu
tive committee, composed of Sen
ator George W. Norris of Ne
braska. Frank P. Walsh, until re
cently chairman of the federal
commission to investigate indus
trial relations; A. J. MeKelwny
and Lewis J. Johnson, has chal
lenged the National Association
for Constitutional Government to
discuss the whole question.
The National Association for
Constitutional Government was
formed to combat all propositions
looking to the removal of control
of government from the bene
ficiaries of special privilege to the
people themselves.
Former President Taft is a
leading member and was one of
ifie organizers. , Elihu Root is
also a member, as are Alton B.
Parker, ex-Senator Burrows and
various other distinguished demo
crats and republicans, who have
pledged themselves to see that
government shall be for the peo
ple, but not of or by the people.
The challenge suggests ex-Pres
ident Taft, Elihu B. Root and Al
ton B. Parker as men who might
properly be chosen to discuss the
question of popular government.
and offers Senator Owen of Okla
homa as the champion of the
league.
Subjects for discussion pro
posed by the league include the
desirability of making it easier to
amend the constitution, and the
necessity of getting the initiative,
the referendum and the recall in
working shape, to make govern
ment representative of the peo
ple instead of the special interests.
The letter of the league is ad
dressed to David Jayne Hill,
chairman of the constitutional
government committee. It says
in part:
"You spoke of the federal con
stitution in the words 'the exist
ing method of amending it being
deemed wise and adequate.' We
hold that the present method is so
cumbersome and restricted as to
endanger peaceful progress, be
cause it permits a small but pow
erful privileged minority to in
definitely block the adoption of
changes necessary to the general
welfare, long after such changes
are demanded by a majority of
the people.
"It took ninety years to secure
the direct election of United
States senators and it took eigh
teen years of fighting to get the
income tax amended, during
which time the wealth of the na
tion escaped taxation in support
of the national government in it
sum estimated at not less than
$2,000,000,000.
"In a word, we propose to
strengthen representative govern
ment by increasing the people's
control over it. You, if we cor
rectly infer your position, oppose
giving further power to the vot
ers, and favor government by
elective oligarchies, recklessly
left exposed, as ut present, to con
trol by invisible influences."
AT THE CAPITAL.
(By Congressman C. 0. Dill.)
More than 58,000,000 acre* of
land previously withdrawn from
homestead entry because of their
possible use for waterpower and
mining purposes will be affected
by the waterpowcr leasing and
640-acre homestead bills which
have passed the House since the
holiday recess.
The waterpower bill provides
for a 50-year lease to persons or
corporations desiring to develop
waterpower on the public domain.
It will also restore 2,.J00,000 acres
to agricultural entry, previously
$1 Year in Advance; 5c Copy
withdrawn. Th« mineral lands
affected by th« mineral leasing
bill. previously withdrawn,
amount to 50,000,000 acres. All
of these hinds will he opened to
entry and patent for agricultural
purposes, subject of course to the
reservation of the right to use any
part for waterpower or mining
purposes as the case may be.
Although most of this land is
rough and much of it worthless
for agricultural purposes, the 640
--acre homestead law will enable
homesteaders to take up large
tracts for stock raising purposes
which otherwise a homesteader
could not afford to patent. Of
course the u"4O-aere act does not
apply except to lands of such
character that 640 acres are
necessary to maintain a family.
These lands will be chiefly valu
able for stock raising purposes
with small agricultural acres here
and there.
All of these bills known as the
waterpower bill, H. B. 408, the
mineral leasing bill, 11. B. 406', and
the 640-acre homestead bill, 11. B.
407, have been referred to the
Committee on Public Lands in the
Senate which is expected to re
port them favorably soon, as Sec
retary Lane and the President are
urging their passage. I shall be
glad to furnish copies of any or
all of these bills to anyone desir
ing them.
Their passage through the
House Ku early in the session was
made possible only because a ma
jority of the members of the Pub
lic Lands Committee, including
myself, stayed here at the capital
during the holiday vacation. We
met practically every day ezcepi
Christmas and New Year's. Ours
was the <mly committee which
met during the holiday recess.
As a result these bills were on the
calendar when Congress opened
and we hope to get them on the
statute books before the big rush
of regular legislation comes.
I don't approve of all the pro
visions in these bills, but they
are the best we western members
could get. In the senate the west
ern Senators will probably be
able to remove many restrictions
which conservationists in the
House insisted should be retained.
One I'aet is certain, a large part
of the resources of the West will
again be opened to development,
if these bills pass the Senate.
MINING NOTES.
The Hunker Hill and Sullivan
mine in the Coeur d'Alenes will
ship much of its low grade lead
and iron ores to the N'orthport
smelter. The zinc product of
this property is going to Midvale,
Utah, for treatment.
A mining stock exchange will
be opened soon at Wallace, Idaho.
An independent stock exchange
lias been recently established in
Spokane.
Tin; net, earnings of the Granny
smelter at Grand Forks, B. C, it
is reported, will exceed $900,000
per month, The net profits on the
copper treated by the plant is
said to be about 20 cents per
pound. Copper is quoted in New
fork at 30 cents per pound, The
increased price of copper is prov
ing a material advantage to the
United Copper mine at Chewelah.
which is the largest copper pro
ducer in the county.
