GERUANS CLAIM
IN AIR BATTLES
Give Figures toShovi'-That on
West Front Allies Have .
;-:y :'' Lost Heavily
That the Allies have lost very much
more seriously in thd air-warfare on
the west front than have the Germans
is part of the information contained in
a cablegram from official German
sources received "early today. " The
cablegram says: 1 .
"German Headquarters, Jan. za. in
the Neuville section : of the west
front French hand-grenade attacks
were repulsed, with heavy losses for
the French. One of the German mine-
craters remained in French hands.
The booty taken by the Germans
on January 26 was further increased
by four machine-guns and two ballis-
"The French have shelled several
places behind the German front and
the Germans replied by shelling
Rheims. Near height 285, northeast of
Lachalade, the Germans occupied a
mine crater after an engagement.
"Concerninghe air attack made by
the enemy in the-night time against
the open and unfortified town of Frei
burg, the reports are not yet complete.
"In the British house of commons
there was made a communication
about German and enemy losses of
aeroplanes which are misleading. The
following statistics furnish the best
answer to these claims:
"From October 1 there were lost on
the west front 16 German aeroplanes,
of which 7 were lost in air engage
ments and 8 shot down , from the
ground by' anti-aircraft guns, one be
ing missing. During 'the same time
the enemy lost 63 aeroplanes, of which
41 were shct down in air engagements,
11 shot from the ground, 11 landing
within German lines. These figures
comprise only the absolutely certain
cases-when the enemy aeroplanes fell
into German hands.
"On the east side, both sides of the
Vidsy, south of Duenaburg and be
tween Stochon and the river Styr were
scenes of minor engagements in which
the Germans made prisoners and took
booty."
