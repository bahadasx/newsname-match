Tuma, Ariz, Jan 29 The Colorado

continued to rise last night and today
and, in anticipation of floods greater
than those of a week ago, inhabitants
of the low-lying river districts are
fleeing to higher ground, taking with
them all livestock ane movable prop

at Yuma ahd at Gila Bend. 156 miles
northeast of here, the Gila, was reported
two feet higher than at any previous
time.
The Southern Pacific railroad today
began the construction of a spur on the
government levee that gave way last
week, preparatory to further reinforc

The lower Otay valley dam was one
of three dams that formed part of the
system of t"- Southern California
Jiountain Water company, which pro
vides San Diego with its water and
formed the bulkhead for one of the
largest reservoirs in the state
It was started In 18ST and completed
in issi. It was a structure of the
rockfilled type with steel core and
the reservoir haa an actual capacity of
11 500.000 gallons. The elevation of the
top or the dam was 4 feet and the
outlet had an elevation of 4o feet.
The top of the dam was 12i feet above
the bed of the river
The reservoir, when filled covered
an area of 10M acres. The area of the
adjacent watershed was about SO
square miles.
According to a report made in 1014,
the dam was valued at 5415,738 and the
reservoir at $1. 165,458
Population Totals Several Thousand.
The population of the entire Otav
vallej probabl totals several thousand
persons. The upper vallev Is about a
quarter of a mile wide, while the lower

down to the ocean.

hastened today to the site of the lower

An investigation of engineering meth
ods, .will be made, it was stated, and
will be of particular interest in this
case because the lower -dam was of
unusual construction The dam, 130
feet "high, was of loose rock tvpe, with
concrete sidewalls. In the center was
imbedded a core of .riveted steel, the
object being to make a watertight dam
without building a solid, concrete one.
A masonry structure. In fact, was
first intended and foundations were
laid for it The change created con
siderable speculation among engineers,
at the time and one text on reservoirs,
discussing it, declared that until the
dam had been filled, and remained
filled for a considerable period, no one
would be able to say whether or not
the design would be a success. Wheth
er any money was saved by making
tne change, the same authority said,
could not be determined. '

Sulphur Springs, Tex, Jan. 29 An
agreed judgment late Friday against
the Dallas Brewery company approved
by judge William Pierson, ended the
last of the seven anti trust suits of the

ture violations of the anti trust and
political contribution laws and bound

GO OM OIE
Newspapers Appealing to
Those in America to Re
turn to Fatherland.
Berlin Germany, Jan. 29 Many
newspapers In different parts of Ger
many, especially the organs of the
Conservatives and Pan -Germans, are
urging a general agitation for the re
turn of the Germans now liTing in the
United States and Canada, to the father
land. The naDers arcniA that the Germans
in the United States, after the attacks
made upon them by president Wilson,
ex-president Roosevelt and the press
of America, have to face bitter perse
cution for many years to come and
will never be treated as the equal of
the Anglo-Americans, or even the
Italians, Slavs. Jews and other ele
ments of the great republic
The "Grenzbooten," a Pan-German
and anti-Semitic weekly, says:
"The Germans in America have
learned during the 18 months of the
war that the position they had gained
for themselves in the economic and
political life of the United States is
ruined foreve-. Although they always
proved themselves loyal arid patriotic
citizens of their adopted country, and
hundreds and thousands of th-m
I '""sm Baer. "e I,as OI tne union
auring tne civil war they are now
treated as outcasts, slandered and
hounded like criminals. Bven the
president of the republic to cater to
the pro-English element does not hesi
tate to brand them as vile traitors and
conspirators without a particle of
proof
"The hope that the American ani
mosity against the Germans will sub
side, after the war is futile. The press,
as far as it Is directed from London
and Wall street, wlH keep up its cam
paign of defamation. The hatred
against everything German will not
1 only not diminish, but grow Nativietic
politicians axe already cegianing to
use it to further their ends and to
propose laws which practically would
rob all citizens born on German soil
of their civil rights. The aim of the
numerically small Anglo-Saxon element
n America is to drive the Germans
out or reduce them politically and so
cially to the level of the negroes in
the south.
"Our brothers across the Atlantic
face a dark future. Through no fault
of their own. their position has be
come unbearable They are today men
without a countrv. although they swore
Iovaltv to the Stars and Stripes and
faithfully kept their oath. Their only
hope lies in their return to Germany
after the war It is our duty to assist
thsm to leave the country, wtaich hates
them for their thrift and efficiency.
Repatriation should be made easy for
them. We need them at home and will
welcome them with open arms."

The opposing lines were so close that
all the French front trenches were

who was left behind with a telephone
to direct the fire.
In a few minutes the lieutenant tele
phoned "Shorten range 20 yards,"
then "shorten range 19 yards more,
then your shells will fall right in the
German trenches."
"All right" replied the battery of
ficer. "You. of course, will now r&
tire to the second line."
A few minutes later the French guns
roared again. They continued 10 min
utes and then the telephone rang
again.
"The German trenches are destroved."
said the lieutenant He was still in the
front line trench. The nearest wrecked
German trench, it was found by actual
measurement was seven yards from
