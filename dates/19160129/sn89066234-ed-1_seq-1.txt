SCOTT COUNTY KICKER
Vol. XIV
BENT6K, MO., JANUARY '), 191
No.
IN THE SOUTHEAST.
What the People are Doing: in Other
Counties that are Near.
The story last week printed in
the Cape Tribune ami reproduced
in the Kicker concerning Fatnerl
Selbert, the missionary priest,
and Miss Cook Of Cape Qlrardeau,
caused much comment among the
Cathoiicsof Scott county. Father
Selbert is well known to man)
of them, for It;' held m i - i m . s at
New Ilnmboir. Orau and else
vvhere In the county ime two
years ngo. He also disposed of
mite n Vi'.toh of 'rolkommener
ablnss' ut so much per. . am told.
Concerning her relation with the
Holy Father, the Tribune quote 1
Miss Cook as saying:
"lie Baked me to become his
wife, and I accepted, He said
he would quit the priesthood and
the church to become my husband
He would register at a hotel and
thou would notify mo to meet him
I spent several hours With him at
B hotel in this city less tlinn a
rear a, 0. The last time I was
with hi was during December.
Ho seat ie to the Ilotnl Princess
in St. u ui.s. and Ji short time al
ter 1 had registered he came to
the hotel and spent several hours
in my room, While he was then
a girl friend of mine, who was at
the hotel in an adjoining room,
opened the dOOT and walked into
the room where Father Seibert
and 1 wit. When she left he want
ed to know w ho she was and
what she meant by coming Into
the room where we were I told
him she was a friend of mine anil
he need have no fear. He seemed
i . . be satisfied. Tt was while we
were there he told me he would
mi t Cue church and marry me
When ho left he embraced me.
and w hen he reached the door he
turned and came back to kiss hie
attain."
if this story be tide, then the
Holy Father will himself be i
market for a "volkommenei
tar
ab-
Inss." So that my non-Catholic
renden may understand thla
re
wonderful .sacrament." I Will
explain, it means the complete
pardon of allpast sins The vic
tim is SUPfM scd to be washed lilly
white and in n perfect state of
purity, fit to eater heaven riant
now. It is n near relative to what
protestants call lancttf icntion
only it costs more. It works this
way :
These missionaries are glib of
tongue. They are of the best of
the priesthood and usually sta.
ata place from one to two weeks
During their stay a '"holy wee':;'
.s proclaimed, and t'.io congreg i-
tlon is urged to abandon all else
and attend the mission daily, A
full head of steam is turned on.
ind the congregation is worked
up to a high pitch of spiritual en
thusiasm, The contribution bos
is passed early and often, and all
are urged to freely " lay up trea
sures in heaven.''
When the congregation has
been worked up to the proper
jiitch it is announced that, by
special grace, full pardons of nil
sins may bo obtained by the pi l I-
tent complying with certain con
llttons, And here is where the
money flows into the priestly cc f
rers. The conditions are first, that
the i enitsftt confess his sins to the
priest Then he must fret on hit
knees and say a lot of prayers,
Then ho must lay on the altar, or
M ine other designated place, as
o sacrifice, ALL THE MONEY HE
CAN AFFORD -according to his
means.
He is cautioned to dig down !r
his pocket deep that he might
fool the priests, but that he can
not fool Qod; and thai unless he
comes across with the last penny
he can afford, the " trick wont
work, This makes the d pe take a
careful Inventors and he lets go
of every dollar he can spare, He
feels that unless he goes the limit,
it will do him no rood So he
lets ' the tall go with the hide."
Imagine how those priests chuckle
as they rake In the bills after .ho
ictlms disappear?
However, the priests deny lha.
they are in politics. Put behind
me the political power of the
priests and I will laugh at "the
law." Suppose you or 1 under
took to work a game as above de
scribed. Unless we had a political
pull to save us. don't you think
the grand jury or prosecuting at
torney would get us?
About two years ago .:. city of
St. Louis began the arrest . ( for
tune tellers, clairvoyants and like
fakers who claimed supernatural
powers, and they were driven out
These were arrested for obtalnln :
money fraudulently. They were
hailed into court and asked to
prove that they had the powers
they claimed to have. Of course
they couldn't do it. any more than
the priests could do it. nut
the priests were not molested. The
plutes and their politicians need
them for they are a very impor
tant part of the capitalist sys
tem of exploitation.
To make his followers believe
in such rubbish the priest must
carefully guard their minds, look
after their education, and see to
it that they do not read "bad
papers." I think it will be ad
mitted that the Seibert-Cook af
fair was the most sensational
happening last week not even ex
cepting the night rider trials al
New Madrid. Yet the Kicker was
the only paper outside of Cape
Girardeau to mention it. This
ought to convince the people, and
especially the Catholics of the
power of the priests over th(
press, All were afraid to mentl
it -fearing the l pycoi
However, if the story related
by Miss Cook is true and the lot
tors slip producei seem to pro VI
It then they who Invested in Fa
ther Sefbert's ''volkommener ob
hiss'' should go to their parish
priests and demand helr n onej
bark.
Years ago the big timber thiev
es, known as the Lumber trust,
stole the f ine timber of the ( Hte , k -Now

ius some of the leavings and'are

Farm Ing ton Times, John T.
Burks i a me up from Mississippi
county last Tuesday to iecure
hounds for a big wolf chase. lb
says the high waters from the
Ohio floods in the Mississippi river
bottoms has driven the wolves
out on the hills and they n:
playing havoc with stock In Mis
sissippi and New Madrid counties
A big wolf bunt 'i being organi
zed in both counties, Mr. Burks
succeeded in securing eighteen
hounds here to join in the chase
Mode Col fman'S pack of ten and
Jack Ball's pack of eight. The
hounds were shipped to Charles
ton Wednesday, and a party of
our sportsmen left yesterday with
Mr. Burks to join In the excitinj
hunt.

honey began to drip from the
i oiling of his homo, just after a
fire had been started in u spare
room. George Bloom of Shelby
county thought it time to investi

attic and found under the eaves
17o pounds of honey. It w as then
recalled that for several years
bees had boon, soon workli i In
and out of cracks In the weather

thought of it until the heat from
the stove molted the w ax and re
leased the honey.
Essex Loader. Mrs Johtl L.
Lankford Of Frisco, four miles
south of this city, fell, breaking
both of her arms Just above the
wrist joints. She was hanging
pa pei' and the step-ladder on
which she w as standing gave waj
causing the above results. At
the time of the accident there
was no one present except her
two small children, but the hus
band reached the house In a abort
time.
iiimo Jlmplioute. Joe Bpringer
this week bought the Wm, Men
eke farm two miles south of this
city. There are 110 acres in the
farm and Mr. Springer paid 99,
900 for It or $00 an acre. Mr
Springer also sold his interest In
the Julius Albrecht farm to Lew
Is Albrecht for $2300.
After quoting an article on pre
pardness from the Kicker, the
Jackson Items concludes: "Al
though this arrangement is from
a Socialistic source there la,
wfthout doubt, a grain of truth
In it." That is encouraging
Frederick Musbaeh of this coun
ty, who had teen at the Farming
ton hospital about a year, died
there last week aged 82 years
He was a brother to W. A. Mus
baeh of lllmo. who had been ap
pointed bis guardian.
O.N BACKS OF THE I' 0R.
The facts concerning our mod
ern civilization are becoming
more and more clearly defined in
the thinking of nil public men to
day. So much so that now wo
are often able to state the Social
ist iews of the situation In the
words of those who are not
known BS Socialists
We present toda.i some strong
words from a recent work of Al
gernon Urapsey In his 'j'.ise of
the Working Cans." He saysj
"From the beginning of civilisa
tion down to the present time it
has boon a fundamental principle
that it is the ri-rht and the duty
of the strong man to make the
Weak man work for him. Civili
zation has boon built up by the
exploitation of the weak by the
strong.
Ancient society expressed thi-
prlnciple frankly and brutally i"
the Institution of slavery. So
dom, which was on advance upon
slavery, was the economic sys
tem ol the middle ages.
in modern times we have a a-
torn of exploitation more perfect,
more destructive than even an
cient -l iveryor medieval m f I
Tim wage system which ,s in vo
gue at the present time does not
even look upon n workman as a
slave or a servant, it doei not
give him even so much of ii iinau-
ity as belonged to those oppress
ed classes ol former time, He Is
treated as If he were Impersonal
without body, pans or passions
Ho Is bought and sold In tti"
market as BO much labor
modlty, He Is speeded up to ex
haustion and scrapped without
mercy. He la given but a amali
portion of the prod ict.s of his la
bor and la subjected to living con
ditions that deplete his energies
and arrest his natural develop
ment, This state of affairs cannot
endure Indefinitely, it Is already
In progress of destruction, The
poor are awakening t a con
sciousness Of the fact tlmt the;
are doing the unrequited labor
of tho world. The rise of the
working class to aelf-eonsclous-no.ss
and class-consciousness is
putting the existing order In peril
Just as SOIUl as that class-consciousness
becomes co-existent
with even a majority of the
working class in all countries,
then the present game Is up, The
w orking class will no longer play
it, and unless the working class
holds its hand the other hand In
the game is useless. "
To which we would add:
Therefore civilization must get
off the backs of the poor. And So
cialism offers the means and
methods by which it may alight

COST OF CHILD LABOR,
From address by L. W. iliac.
.v 5,000-mile procession of child
workers it asking us ii we can af
ford child labor. If I can show
you bjt a part of that procession
which I have followed from the
oannerlea of Maine to '.he cotton-
ie'.i.
Texas, they win toll
u
what child labor has cost them,
what It costs their families, what
it costs Industry, what it costs
society VOL" AM) ME and they
will ask you, "Does it pay?''
They start off with happy
hearts and happy faces, for work
is fun at first, bit a machine
tears at one child's body; coal
dust smothers another; eye
strain and body-strain arrests
their development; their Joy ceas
es. They are ready for the hu
man junk-plle, and who foots the
bills?
Even if they esoaps physical
harm, can they escape the mental
and moral taint of illiteracy, of
deadcniuE monotony, of close ac
quaints m-e '.villi vice ani crime?
The newsle on the street pambles
and knows "tiie underworlds"
the messenger-boy on bis wheel
carries notes to and from the red
light districts. Tlu majority of
the boys in our juvenile courts,
have been street-workers; they
have tampered with the moral
buzz-saw.
So, if Industry saves by child
lobor, society pays, because child
1 labor works in a vicious cycle by
inaaequently preparing children
for life and handicapping them for
future work and the rearlntc of
their own families. Industry has
stooped pretty low wnen It drawa
