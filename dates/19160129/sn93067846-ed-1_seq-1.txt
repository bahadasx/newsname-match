COMPULSION BILL MOVES ON.
PASSED SECOND READING BY
HOUSE QF LORDS.
Archbishop of Canterbury Bestows |
Benediction on Measure as Effort to
Meet Situation.
London, Jan. 25.?The house of
lords without division passed the sec?
ond reading of the military service bill
this afternoon.
The Marquis of, Lansdowne, minis?
ter without portfolio, spoke strongly
of the necessity of enacting the meas?
ure.
The Archbishop of Canterbury, in I
the course of* the debate, bestowed a !
benediction on the measure, saying he j
regarded it as a plain, straightforward,
Vigorous efforr. to meet a situation ex
traordlnariiv difficult.
Earl Curzon, lord privy councillor,
in concluding the debate, expressed
the opinion that the most serious crit?
icism of the oill was' made by those
who contended that it does not go
far enough.
The Earl of Derby, director of re?
cruiting, said he was convinced that
jthe bill when Imposed on the country
[would not make the disturbance in in?
dustrial circles that many had pre?
dicted. He said he was more fright?
ened by the extent of the exemptions
granted by the government than by
tho reductions in men available for
military service made by the measure.
Since his report was made four lists
of reserved occupations had been is?
sued.and he could not help being ap?
prehensive when he learned that no
less than 100,000 badges exempting
men from military service had been
issued in four days last week.

ized and empowered to establish cer?
tain rules and regulations for the sale
of fertilizers in South Carolina, in so
far as the same may be affected by
