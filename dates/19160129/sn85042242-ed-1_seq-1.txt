VALUE OF SHIP AND
Craft Believed to Have Been Lost
Off the East African
Coast.
7—
London, Jan. 28.—Fears that the
British and African Steam Navigation
company's liner Appam has gonp
down off the EasL African coast, with
loss of all aboard, are expressed by
morning papers. There were 301
souls aboard, 87 first-class and 81
second-class passengers and 133 in
he crew. Most of the passengers
were English and residents of Lon­
don, while a majorily of the crew"
were natives of 'Liverpool.
The Appam left Dakar, in the
French colony of Senegal, West Afri­
ca, for Plymouth on January 11. The
trip normally occupies but ten days,
but no definite report has come from
1he vessel.
A dispatch from Hill says the Brit­
ish steamship Tregantle reports hav­
ing passed at sea on January 10, a
lifeboat with the name of Appam
painted on the stern and the bow
knocked away.
Speculatiori regarding the case of
the catastrophe varies from submar­
ine attack to an internal explosion.
The value of the liner and ner cargo
is estimated at fully $1,500,001).
A very high rate for reinsurance is
being quoted on the steamers Ariad­
ne and Clan Mactavish, which are
overdue on voyages over the same
route as the Appam took.
Shipping men say there is little
likelihood that the Appam could have
succumbed to a storm without noti­
fying the coast stations with her wire

ANTI-GtRIAN
IT
IN SWITZERLAND
Paris, Jan. 28.—Fresh anti-German
demonstrations took place last night
at Lausanne, a Swiss city on the
north shore of Lake Geneva. Toward
midnight the great crowds which
surged through the streets were dis­
persed, but at the railway station a
small group of persons surrounding
a German flag was attacked with
canes, stones and fists.
The police were forced to use their
swords before they could rescue the
men attacked. This information is
contained in a Havas dispatch from
Geneva.
JSarlier in the day, an angry crowd
had pulled down a German flag which
had been hoisted by the German con­
sul in honor of Emperor William's
birthday. ...
Jn the rioting great crowds choked
the street in which the German con­
sulate is situated, but they were held
back from close approach to the con­
sulate by strong forces of police. The
crowds then contented themselves
with hissing and hooting against Ger­
many.
As a result of the encounter be­
tween the police and demonstrants at
the railway-station one man was se
verely injured, and taken to the hos­
pital.
Ft. Yates, N. D., Jan. 28.—The case
of Dr. C. G. Andrews, who is confined
at the agency hospital with frozen
feet, is not progressing favorably. It
became necessary to amputate a por­
tion of one heel and several toes, and
if this brings no relief it may be ne­
cessary to amputate both feet. The
sympathy of all who heard of this
case goes out- to the young doctor,
who, being unacquainted with the
dangers of travel on a stprmy night
across an unknown country to give
aid to some suffering person.
According to Dr. Thomas, the new
government1 doctor at the agency, it
will hot be necessary to amputate his
feet.

HER LIFE STORY
Miss Burger Entered Home and
Stole Affection of Her
Husband.
Providence, It. I., Jan. 28.—After
having repeatedly asserted that she
never intended to divorce lier hus­
band, Dr. C. 'Franklin Mohr, and that
there was no sincere desire on his
part to divorce her, Mrs. Elizabeth
F. Mohr, charged with instigating two
negroes, Cecil Brown and Henry
Spellman, to murder him, admitted
in cross-examination today that she
had discussed with her attorneys last
summer the
Question
of allowing Dr.
'Mohr to have an absolute divorce on
the basis ol! his turning over to her
his iNtewporl villa, known as the Mont
pelier, and $75,000 in cash.
Apart from her testimony regard­
ing the conferences over the test!
mony over an absolute divorce, the
introduction of letters written by
Mrs. Mohr to iGeorge W. JRooks, bro­
ther-in-law of iBmily Burger, who was
wounded the night when Dr. Mohr
was killed, was a feature of the after­
noon atfosiorr. -—--.''V c.-*,
In one of these letters, it appeared
that Dr. (Mohr had said to Miss Burg­
er over the telephone, in the pres­
ence of his son, Charles:
"I know we love each other and
they are trying to part us."
Another letter contained the dec­
laration by Mrs. 'Mohr that she be­
lieved it impossible to keep Miss
Burger away from her husband. The
third letter indicated that Mrs. iMohr
at the time she wrote it was angry
with the girl, whom she accused or
breaking up her home.
"If I got a hold of her Saturday,"
this letter said, "I'd have about killed
her."
N0W_£ SESSION

Grand Forks, Jan. 28.—Grand Forks
is playing host to the "press boys" of
North Dakota.
The annual winter meeting of the
North Dakota Press association open­

day are that the meeting will be one
of the most largely attended in1 the
history of the organization.
Advertising is the keynote of the
program, and it. will be discussed
from every possible standpoint.
The entertainment, feature will be
the banquet, which will be given to­

of dishes comprising nationally-ad
vertised materials. A dance will con­
clude the evening's entertainment.
Following this dinner, Maurice I.
Flagg of the Minnesota Art commis­

They will be guests at the banquet,
however, and it is probable that they

TO
TO
Washington, Jan. 28.—President
Wilson left Washington tonight for a
speaking tour in the middle west in
advocacy of his preparedness pro­
gram. He has been told that most of
the opposition to army and navy in­
creases is centered in that section of
the country and believes that the suc­
cess of his defense plans depends, in
a large measure, in the impression he
makes.
He will be away from Washington
until February 4.
The president will go over the army
and navy program minutely, giving in
detail the reasons why he believes
they should be adopted, and also will
touch on the Mexican and internation­
al questions and on various measures
pending in congress.
Mr. Wilson has decided, it is under­
stood, i?ot to mince words in his refer­
ences to "peace at any price" advo­
cates or to supporters of extreme mili­
tary increases.
The first address will be in Pitts­
burg tomorrow afternoon. Through­
out the trip, the president will avoid
banquets and other entertainments.
Mrs. Wilson, who will accompany the
president, will be met: at all stops by
committees of women.

United States Suggests Belliger­
ents Fix Declaration of
"Principles.
TO PROVIDE SAFETY
FOR MERCHANTMEN
Crews and Non-Belligerents to Be
Placed in Safety Before
Attacks.
Washinglbn, Jan. 2S.—A suggestion
that all the belligerent, countries sub­
scribe to a declaration of principles
governing attacks on inerrhrinf ves­
sels and forbidding the arming of
such vessels has bten made by the
United States in an effort to establish
in international law :i general policy,
disposing of many of I no vexatious
problems arising from I tie develop­
ment of submarine warfare.
Identical notes have gone forward
asking the various countries at war
to say specifically whether Ihey are
willing to join in such iu agreement.
The declaration of principles would
provide:
May Expect Protection.
That, non-combatants may expect
protection under the rules of interna­
tional law, and the principles of hu­
manity when traveling on merchant
ships that warning must be given be­
fore a merchantman is attacked that
belligerent-owned merchant ships
must obey warnings to stop that mer­
chantmen shall not lie tired on except
in case of resistance or flight' that
no merchantman shall be gunk, ex­
cept where it is impossible 1o supply
a prize crew, or until passengers and
crew are placed in safety that mer­
chantmen shall not ho permitted to
mount arms.
Would Mean Settlement.
Favorable responses from the bel­
ligerents would'be looked on as
.cUncWn&.thi
Warfare for which tile United States
has contended through extended nego­
tiations with Germany and Austria,
and at the same time disposing of a
troublesome question, recently inten­
sified by the arrival at New York of
three armed Italian merchant vessels.
Germany and Austria already have
agreed in effect to the proposals re­
garding attacks on commercial ships,
and Great Britain and her allies have
always been understood to be in ac
cord with the American viewpoint on
that subject.
Seeking Information.
The United States has addressed
another inquiry to Austria asking if
any of its submarine commanders
have knowledge of the destruction of
the British vessel, Persia.
State department, officials consider
that they virtually have exhausted
every other .source of information in
their efforts to establish what caused
the sinking of the Persia, with th"
loss of two American lives. Asser­
tions by survivors that the ship was
torpedoed by a hostile submarine,
presumably Ausirian, have not been
proved.
The state department wants a defi­
nite statement from the German gov­
ernment and should a denial be re­
ceived, the case will probably be con­
sidered closed.
The Italian liners, American and
Verona, will bo permitted to sail from
New York if 1he Italian government
gives assurances as it did in the case
of the Guiseppe Verdi that their guns
will be used only for defensive pur­
poses.
ILL QUICK THE
Those Robbing Chicago Bank of
$15,000 Landed by Police Spe­
cial Grand Jury.
Chicago, Jan. Just X6 hours af­
ter the daring $15,000 robbery of the
Washington Park National bank yes­
terday morning. Chicago police, who
had regarded the case as extremely
difficult of solution, achieved the fol­
lowing:
"The arrest of the five alleged rob­
bers."
"The recovery of more than half
the loot, with prospects for recovery
of the remainder tomorrow. The con­
fession of one of the bandits."
Information has reached •States At­
torney Hoyne that criminals had been
imported at the instance of "certain
politicians and policemen" to perpe­
trate a series of crimes for the pur­
pose of discrediting the city's admin­
istration, putting Nicholas Hunt, new
chief of the detective bureau, under
a cloud and thus indirectly getting
revenge on Maclay Hoyne, 'States At­
torney, for his successful prosecution
of police graft cases.
Clearing up of minor crimes by the
confession, called for a special grand
jury tomorrow to take speedy action
against the prisoners. The bandits
were not "baby bandits," as at first
suspected, 'but ranged from 25 to 30
years.
A.
Are you very blond— hair golden,
eyes blue, tall, liihe of limb, fair of
skin? You are? Well,, tlieu—sit
DOWN!
Are you brunette- sloe-eyed, raven
haired, olive-skinned, languorous, of
movement? Well, then, YOU sit
DOWN, too!
But did Nature work over you'with
an egg beater, as it were? Do blond
and brunette mix happily in yog?
Have you eyes of blue and hair of
brown, cheeks of red and dark skin,
tall body,
IhiI
graceful curves? Are
you neither so blond that summer
suns peel your shoulders nor so
swarthy that the same old sun makes
you look like a relative once removed
of the King of Somaliland?
Well, if so, none can blame you for
being very proud of yourself. iFor a
full blond figures, according 1 Dr.
Blackford, as being "one hundred on
the scale." And a brunette is no bel­
ter, though what's good in dark Is
not in light, and what's good in light,
understand, is not good in dark.
But a "fifty-on-the-scaler" is a hap­
py medium. It seemed, from what
the scientific lady said, man or wo­
man so endowed is the best ever. If
ihey inherited the bad qualities from
the others she didn't mention her be­
lief to that effect. No, she left the
"fifty-on-the-scaler" on a pedistal of
perfection high as Eiffel.
To illustrate what she meant, she
trotted out several dummies.
She said that blonds, while they
were ouickest, loved life, were always
world conquerors and rulers of men
(now, here, Caesar, Hannibal, Napol­
eon! you beat it right back to your
sarcophagi and be still!) were most
active creatures and tallest, and all
regular cut-ups and rip-arounds they
were also inconstant, fickle of heart,
lacked deliberation, were get-rich
quiclc persons and most given to
crimes of passion and impulse and
Aha! That for the blonds!
Right away then she walked to the
other end of the row of dummies,
where sat two markedly brunettes—
man and girl dummies, and smack in
their teeth she barred the souls of
brunettes to the world.

nominal ion, but declined to be quot­

Monday the senate judiciary com­

War Only Beginning.
"I think the war is only beginning,"
said David Lloyd George, minister of
munitions, in an interview today,
"but I am absolutely confident of vic­
tory because, although we all have
made mistakes in the past, England
and her allies are now taking council
together and will be stronger because
they are united. By next spring we
shall have for the first time more mu­

tion is growing worse daily."
Laborers Are Patriotic.
The British labor conference closed
today with another victory for the
patriotic element over the anti-war

they remain in office was adopted by
a majority of 1,127,000.
