Secretary McAdoo will be the prin

er. Senator Rom Salmon was one of
the few Democrats who voted for
the statewide bill in the Senate the

Twenty-seven per cent, of the 12,
000,000 immigrants over 14 years old,

like 3,500,000, were illiterates.
Representative Bailey says that
more than a score of Democratic Con
gressmen have agreed to organize a
fight on the President's defense pro
gram. The impression is growing at
Frankfort that it. will be impossible to
draft and enact a revenue measure
within the time remaining for the reg
ular session of the Legislature.

KUchin opposing and Republican
House Leader Maun supporting the
President's defense policy, politics at
Washington is making some strange
hed-fellows.
Gov. Stanley made no mistake in

the subject of women suffrage, but
Mnieved the matter snouiu uv waii
the states.

MERRITT CASE
REVERSED
Big Damage Suit Decided By
The Court of Appeals Last
Thursday. ,
CRAVENS VS. MERRITT, JR.
Verdict In Lower Court Was
For $6,000 Last
Year.
The important damage suit of B. P.
Cravens against Geo. H. Merritt, Jr.,
was reversed in the court of Appeals
Thursday.
Cravens sued for alienation of his
wife's affections and the jury gave a
verdict of $6,000 against the defend
ant. During the progress of the trial
Merritt lost his head on account of
the vigorous language of Attorney
John C. Duffy in his speech for the
plaintiff and struck the attorney in the
court room.
Mrs. Cravens was a principal wit
ness and her testimony was damaging
to the defendant. The verdict at the
time was regarded by Merritt's at
torneys as unjust and an appeal was
taken. The verdict by the decision is
set aside and the case will have to be
tried again.
