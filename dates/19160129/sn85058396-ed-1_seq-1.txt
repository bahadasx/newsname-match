today with the London correspondent
of the Milan Secolo, "but 1 am ab

although we all have made mistakes
in the past. England and her allies
aro now taking counsel together and

Paris. Jan. 29, 4:45 a. m. The
Paris newspapers publish further ex
cerpts from the interview yesterday
of David Lloyd-George, minister of
munitions, with the London corres

that they are gaining now while Ger
many is weakening.

Great Britain United for War.
"This Is a democratic war. If it
was not, T should have nothing to do
with It. I was opposed to the last
war that England engaged In, but In
the present war the future of democ
racy in the whole world Is involved
It is a final struggle between military
autocracy and political liberty, a hlde
our. conflict, but one wherein we shall
be victorious, of that I am certain.
"The central empires have lost their
chance of victory and they know it
Great Britain is united for this war
to such a point that, If there were a
general election, not a single anti-war
member would be elected.
Six Million Willing to Serve.
"I foresee no difficulty," continued
the minister, "in connection with com
pulsion. No fewer than six million
men came forward to enlist. Some
wero unfit for service, others were
required for the munitions factories,
for the railroads and for tho mines.
About 380,000 men are affected by the
compulsory service measure, but this
number Is diminishing through dally
attestations.
"Do not be under any misapprehen
sion," Mr. Lloyd-George is further
quoted as saying, "Great Britain is
determined to push the war to the
end. We may make mistakes, but we
never give In. It was British stub
bornness which overthrew Napoleon
after twenty years of war. Our allies
then fell away one by one and Eng

RELIEF PARTIES
RUSH TO DAM
Procession of Automobiles and
Motor Trucks Leave San
Diego for Stricken
Otay Valley.
MANY LIVES ARE LOST
Billions of Gallons of Water
Let Loose From Great South
ern California Water
Company Reservoir.
San Diego, Cal., Jan. 29. Relief
parties in automobiles and a proces
sion of motor trucks left here today
for the striken Otay valley, fifteen
miles to the south, where the burst
ing of the Lower Otay dam late
Thursday loosed thirteen billion gal
lons of water upon the little streak
of parable land between ridges of hills
and drowned probably fifty persons.
The motor trucks carried provisions
for the survivors in the valley, tools
and pontoons for fording swollen
streams where bridges are out. The
pace of the relief expedition, It was
believed, would depend upon the slow
er vehicles. All communication with
the valley and the little town of Otay
at its foot remained cut off
This city, some fifteen miles up San
Diego bay from the entrance of Otay
creek, was In no direct danger from
the flood at any time, but its water
supply, coming largely from the sys
tem of which the Lower Otay dam
was a part, was curtailed today, and
National City and Chula Vista, su
burbs, were reported cut off from
usual water sources altogether.
Persons familiar with the contour
of the country said today that the loss
of life and greatest damage undoubt
edly occurred close to the dam, and
that in the lower valley which is
broad, property damage would be
great, but loss of life unlikely.
Engineering parties, and civil au
thorities joined the rescue parties
which hastened today to tho site of
the Lower Otay dam. 17 miles south
east of here An investigation of en
gineering methods will be made, it
was stated, and will be of particular
interest in this case because the low
er dam was of unusual construction.
The dam, 130 feet high, was of the
loose rock type, with concrete side
walls. In the center was Imbedded a
core of riveted steel, the object being
to make a water tight dam without
building a solid concrete one. A mas
onrv structure, in fact was first in
tended, aud foundations were laid for
It. The change created considerable
interested speculation among engi
neers at the time and one expert on
reservoirs, discussing It, deciarea lum
until the dam had been filled, and re
mained for a considerable period, no
one would be able to say whether or
not the design would be a success.
Whether anv money was saved by
making the change, the same author
ity said, could not be determined.
"Bodies and Houses Carried to Sea.
Otay creek empties into tho very
foot of San Diego bay, and wrecked
ranch houses and dead animals, borne
ten miles north in the bay by the cur
rent of the flood brought the first In
timations here that a flood had co
curred. For many hours after the
disaster, no word of it had traversed
the ridges fifteen miles from Otay
creek to this city.
LOSSES IN THE
OTAY VALLEY
Many Dead Bodies Have Been
Found by First Relief
Parties.
San Diego, Jan. 29, by Wireless to
Los Angeles. The 'first men forming
relief parties reached the Otay val
ley today and found tho entire valley
devastated by the flood water releas
ed by the breaking of the Lower Otay
dam " late Thursday.
Six bodies from the flood waters of
Otay river wero brought into San
Diego. Eleven more were found near
the mouth of Otay river but were not
moved. Reports from other sections
stated that five other bodies had been
recovered and that It was feared many
more were among the debris or car
ried out to sea.
Some of the bodies recovered at the
mouth of Otay river were badly muti
lated, it was said, and Identification
probably will be difficult.
No definite estimate has yet been
made of the total number of deaths
but it undoubtedly will total at least
50.
The Tiajimna river was Its highest
In Its history and reports received
hero from Tijuana say the town Is
under water. The racetrack located
on the border is believed to have been
carried away.
Reports say probably many persons
have been drowned at Tijuana.
Twenty-seven houses are known to
have been carried to destruction, the
water talcing wit hit all livestock,
crops and implements.
Further north tho San Diego river
was at flood stage and was cutting
new channels.
Reports from the site of the lower
dam which were received from offi
cials of the water department stated
that the entire dam had been carried
away. Measurements showed that a
wall of water 30 feet high and 1,200
feet wide tore through the valley,
sweeping everything before It.
The Otay river still was a raging
torrent.
11T1 LIS ARE
KILLING DEER IN
THIS SITE
George H. Barney, who Is here, from
Escalante, Utah, for a short detail at
the district forest office, reports that
couger, or mountain lions, are mak
ing serious Inroads on the number of
deer in the Powell forest and vicinity.
The animals are so hold that they
come close to town, and George Camp
bell and two associates recently killed
a large lion about four miles north
of Escalante. The marauder had just
killed two deer and buried them Id
the snow, one of these a six-prong
buck.
Not only are the lions killing more
deer than the hunters, but they are
making the deer wild and harder to
kill by hunters.
The Garfield County High school
school building, recently dedicated at
Panguitch, Is used six days In the
week, the high school continuing on
Saturday in order to free the boys
earlier for the farms in the spring.
The people of Escalante wish to
put in a town telephone system, If ar
rangements can be made to attach to
the government lines, which enter Es
calante from Boulder, Teasdale and
Winder.
The initial steps have been taken
toward the consummation of one of
the most important irrigation proj
ects in eastern Garfield county, the
Introduction of water on to the Es
calante desert. It will be on a small
scale at the first, but for this the
citizens have begun the ditch which
Is to divert the water from Pine
creek and to get out the logs to be
sawed into staves for the inverted
siphon across the valley of the Esca
lante river. After crossing the valley,
the water will be conducted along the
foot of the circle cliffs on a plane
higher than any point of the desert.
Pine creek is small and its entire
flow at low water stage is now ap
propriated, so dependence will be
placed on high spring water. Any
considerable reclamation of the des
ert will, therefore, depend upon the
construction of a dam on the moun
tain, 25 miles north of Escalante, to
store the water from melting snow.
The state, which last fall Improved
about a mile of the highway contlnu-
, ii. r,t r.sM,isin ..nor! fntcnrrl "Rs-
calonte, is preparing to resume con
struction. Losses of cattle do not occur on the
desert in the colder part of the win
ter, and considerable snow is even
beneficial in furnishing moisture
available for the grazing of range
remote from water holes. Cattle came
off the mountain range last fall in not
so good condition as usual, and since
there had been a lack of storms In
the summer to produce good winter
range considerable anxiety was felt
as to' whether all the stock would
winter. The severe test is a cold spell
following a rain or thaw when a coat
ing of ice is formed covering the
feed. The ice causes the cattle's
mouths to become sore, and in paw
ing the foed out from under the crust,
their legs become sore, they become
discouraged and get poor, and lie
down under the trees, never to rise.
If the winter continues mild, how
ever, the unusually heavy fall of
snow will produce ideal conditions
fcr a prosperous year.
