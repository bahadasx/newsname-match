Card of Thanks.
To My Friends Who Supported MAe in
the Race for Coroner:
I desire to express my appre
ciation and sincere thanks to
you for the hearty support you
gave me. Although defeated, I
shall by no means consider my
race made in vain if the princi
ples I advocated finally prevail
and teereby result in a better
regulation in regard to the prac
tice for the prisoners in the jail,
and a less frequent holding of
inqussts where the facts and cir
cumstances do not justify such a
procedure, thus causing less
wrangling between the police ju
ry and coroner in reference to
the bills of the latter.
DR. J. L. WOODALL.
Cold Weather Aches and Pains.
Many aches and pains, sore muscles,
stiff gjoints and much rheumatism at
tributed to cold weather have their first
cause in failure of the kidneys to prop
erly eliminate waste matter ftom the
system. Foley Kidney Pills tome up
weak and diseased kidneys, giving
prompt relief from aches and pains.

Down On His Back.
"About two years ago I got down on
my back," writes Solomon Bequette,

Foley Kidney Pills and they straighten
ed me right up. I recommend them to
all who have kidney trouble." Rheu
matic aches and pains, soreness and
stiffness, yield quickly to Foley Kidney
