However, we do beljeye that a. trolley
line from Stockton on the Rock Island
via Plainville, Hays, LaGrpsse and to
some point on the Santa Fe, would be
all that is necessary at present. Be?
sides the passenger traffic, with the
proper equipment,' light freight could
be carried over the line. The road
could be financed by local capital of the
counties through which it passes. We
can point to a $ozen men in this county
who could put in from $10,000 to $50,
000, and we presume the ether counties
could do as well. It would put the
towns through" which it would pass in
closer touch and would be a great stim
ulant to the Fort Hays Normal School.
While" all the towns would be greatly
benefited. Hays perhaps, on account of
the Experiment Station and the Norr
ma!, would receive the largest share.
Why not agitate.a trolley line? It can

Business Men's Meeting.
Last Tuesday morning at 10:30, by
invitation of C. G. Cochran, the busi
ness men of iays including Mayor
Oshant and President Lewis of the Fort
Hays Normal, met at the Essex hall to
discuss the matter of better railroad t
services. The chairman, C. G. Cochran
who had interviewed the officials of the
road at Omaha and Kansas City, open
ed the meeting with a short talk.' He
stated among other thing3 that the
Company intend to put on the extra
grains , about March first and advised
that the citizens wait before trying to
push matters and see if they intend
making their promise good.
Mayor Oshant, President Lewis and
Hon. John Chittenden then followed
him with short talks coinciding with
Mr. Cochran's views. A motion was
then offered and seconded and was car
ried by the meeting that a resolution
be adopted and signed by the business
men of the city setting forth their
wishes in the matter and read before
the Utilities Board which meet3 in
Topeka, January 27th. A committee
of five was then appointed to draft the
resolutions, 'consisting of President
Lewis, Fred Miller, Geo. Philip, Jr.,
Al Nickles and B. M. Dreiling.
A committee of five was then ap
pointed to present the petition at the
meeting of the Utilities Board, consist
ing of Mayor Oshant, Hon. John Chit
tenden, H. J. Penney and C. W. Reeder
C. W. Miller, candidate for State Sen
ator, and Banker C. G. Cochran will go
along "delegates at large" as it were,
to see that the balance of the crowd
are treated right and kept out of mis
chief.
"Who's Who."
The "geek" who wrote the article
under the caption, "Who is Sheriff?
which appeared in the State Journal of
January 25th, must surely be non comp
os mentis, or is trying to discredit Ellis
county. He must be a chronic crank
and therefore an "undesirable citizen,"
as every man in the county knows there
is not the least likelihood of Davis ever
returning to Hays. He is $125 short in
his account with the county, about $400
short on executions issued from C. W.
Miller's court, and smaller executions
aggregating about $50, besides numer
ous debts owing to individuals in Ellis
and Hays. Also it 13 reported that his
backers for his campaign fund are hold
ing the sack for $800.. Taking all things
into accoount, Davis will hardly dare to
show himself in Ellis county; if he
should, a warrant for fcls arrest will be
issued "instanter." A. O. Robinson is
"Who's Who" and is attending, to 'ths
job of sheriff of Ellis cj ity in a very
satisfactory manner, thank you!
Later Since writing the above we
learn from undoubted authority thit
Mr. Davis was in debt to fifteen citi
zens in Ellis and Hays in amounts run
ning from $25-to $200 and aggregating
$2,397.50,. besides there is known to be
some county business for which he is
responsible that has not been thorough
ly sifted. Does anyone think that
Davis, in view of the above findings,
will ever return to Hays?

John Miller the hustling Hyacinth

whom it is a pleasure to meet one of

Gay Tillotson, the southside barber,
let a $5.50 bottle of Delux hair tonic
fall on the sidewalk Wednesday after
noon, while coming from the express
office to his shop. The contents was
spilled all over the walk and was an en
tire loss. If Gay had been addicted to
the use of the "ardent," we certainly
would have thought that he had dis
covered a new brand of booze.
There are several reasons besides
a low rate why it pays to get a farm
loan at the Citizens State Bank,
Hays City; Kansas.
- The iron pc3t3 for the white way
have all been placed along Juniata
street west from Chestnut, and three
along South Chestnut street from
Wiesner's store to the Brunswick cor
ner. The jay automobile drivers,
especially Ex-Mayor Geo. Philip who
sports a Studebaker six cylinder car,
should be very careful while driving
along the "white way" that he don't
come to grief. Those light standards
are set pretty thick.
Word comes from Denver that Katie
Joslin who .went there gome time ago
for her health, "is not Improving any

Nebr., was sent for and is with her.
Katie has been one of our best teach
ers in Elli3 county and we axe sorry to
learn of her illness. She has a com
plete nervous breakdown which was
caused by her overwork while teaching.'
She was one of those faithful conscien
tious teachers and did more than was
required of her.
D. H. Early, one of Hays City's re

morning at 2 o'clock. He has bee a ail

to be about the house most of the time
and occasionally was seen on the streets
until within the past ten days. We
have been unable to learn at what time
the funeral will occur, but he will prob
ably not be buried until Sunday. He
has been a resident of Hays and E1H3
county for many years and his friends
are many. Obituary will be published
in this paper next week. '
Thursday, Friday and Saturday night
last week will be remembered with
pleasure by the theatre going people
of Hays. It was the occasion of the
Ida Weston Rea Company's visit to
our city. This company stands at the
top in the "play world." Their plays
are all clean and wholesome no "horse
play" in their vaudeville, which you
find more or less of in the average trav
leing troupe. Manager Fredorvicz, of
the new Opera Honte should be compli

ing out for something good far his pa

A Bad Blaze,
Thursday evening the usual quiet o
this city was disturbed by the long loud
whistle from the Hays mill, which" de
noted that there was a fire Sjomewhere
in the citj-. It waa aooa - ascertained
that it wa at the residence of A. A.
Weianer on North Chestnut Street.
The southside fire hose, pulled by an
automobile, started south and ran two
or three blocks before it occurred to
them that they were going the wrtrng
way. The northside hose cart we pre
sume must have gone "straight up."
At last when they arrived at the scene
of the fire, they found that the hose
was frozen up and no water could go
through them. The Wiesner boys, Joe

Experiment Station Notes.
A car load of well , bred : Hokteia
heifers was received recently by- tlc
Experiment Station. Most of thtz,
will be' added to the dairy farm herd1,
on the Station, and some will be cld
to parties' in this vicinity who have
been seeking the aid of the Experiment
Station, to obtain dairy cows. Any 02
interested, should see the young heif
ers offered.
Dean Jardine, Director of the Kan
sas Experiment Stations, was a guest .
of the Experiment Station, Friday of
; Three students of the Normal School
werk at the Station in order to make
expenses while attending college.
The new list of forest and shade
trees is ready for distribution, and par
ties interested can secure copies by
telephoning to the Experiment Station
office. The rains of last summer de
ceveloped the nursery trees more than
ordinary seasons do, so their stock
must be fine for spring planting. '
Farmers who have grown well bred
seeds of sorghums or other field crops
should notify the Experiment Station
as they will be glad to aid growers In
disposing of good, clean seed grain.
Ten wether lambs, produced from
the Station's Shropshire nock, were re
cently sent to the Animal Husbandry
Dept., of the Agricultural College.
These will be used in judging work at
