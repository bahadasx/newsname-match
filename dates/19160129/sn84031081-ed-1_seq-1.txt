Washington, Jan. A suggestion
thiit rill tlio belligerent countries subscribe-
to a declaration of prlciples
governing nUaek-i on merchant vessels,
has been made, by the United States
In an effort to establish In Interna
tional law a policy disposing of many
of tho vexatious problems arising'
from tho development of submarine
warfare.
Identical note have. Bone forward
asking tho various countries at war to
nay specifically whether they are will
ing to Join in such an agreement. Tho
declaration of principles would pro
vide: Rules to He Observed.
That non-combatants may expect
protection under the rules of interna
tional law and the principiles ofhu
mnnity when traveling on merchant
ships; that warnintf must be given be
fore a mrechantman Is attacked; that
belligerent-owned ships most obey
warnings to stop; that merchantmen
shall not be fired on except in ease,
of resistance or flight; that no mer
chantman shall be sunk except where
it is impossible to supply a prize crew
fir until passengers and crew are
placed In safety; that merchantmen
shall not be permitted to mount arms.
Would Settle Principles.
Favorable responses from the bel
ligerents " 'would " be looked on '&s
clinching the principles of submarine
warfare for which the United .States
1ms contended through its extended
negotiations with Germany and Aus
tria and at the same time disposing
of a troublesome question recently
accentuated by the arrival at New
York of three armed Italian merchant
vessels. Germany and Austria already
have agreed in effect to the propo
sals regarding attacks on commercial
ships and Great Hrltain and her allies
always have been understood to be In
accord with the American viewpoint
on that subject.
Warning 1 Voiced.
Officials pointed out tonight that
f-hould any of the belligerents fail to
agree with the proposals, the United
States would have no difficulty In en
forcing the principle so far as it con
cerned vessels entering American
ports. The note itself voiced a warn,
tng that this government is consid
ering adoption of a policy under
which all armed merchantmen . that
enter ports of the United States in
future shall he considered war ves
sels subject to the established regu
lations governing internment.
Announces Clwnacd Policy.
In ils note the United States calls
attention lo tho fact that it has chang
ed its policy toward mounting guns on
merchantmen since submarines be
gun to play such a large part In na
val warfare. Officials made It clear
that this change had not resulted
lro msuggestions of any foreign gov
ernment, but solely from the changed
conditions.
"It was merely from a humanitar
ian standpoint," said one high official
in discussing the note, "and In order
that there might be some arrange
ment to save Innocent lives." What
ever attitude the belligerents adopt In
their replies, It was added, the United
Slates expects to stand on the prin
ciples It has enunciated as sound in
ternatlonnl law.

Shuns February Kngattrmcnts.
One thing which the politicians
have ascertained is that the. president
is making no engagements for Febru-iwest
ary. Of course, ho has a certain num-
ber of fixed receptions and dinners
to take care of, but invitations to (ill
other functions during the coming
month are being "received nnd con
sidered" subject to acknowledged in
ability on the part of the president
to say at this time where lie will be
In February. From this the deduc
tion Is reached thut if the first trip
promised well, others will follow.
It's an (Hd I'Iflii of Ills.
It is being recalled that when Mr.
Wilson was governor of New Jersey
his favorite weapon in forcing mem
bers of the legislature to vote his way
wag to suggest that he would go into
the recalcitrant member's district and
debate the o.ucstion before the voters.
The governor of that state is limited
by the state constitution to a single
term of three'years. In his letter to
A. Mitchell Palmer of Pennsylvania
written shortly after the election
of,
1913, Mr. Wilson deplored this one
term provision for an executive, since
it robbed him of much of his Influ
ence over legislators.
One Term Weapons Scarce.
With the president now about to
use his New Jersey weapon on the
members of congress by debating his
project before the voters of the var
ious states, it is reflected that he is
doing about the only thing a one term
executive can do, according to his
own formula, to force tho hands of
legislators.
It Is not claimed, however, that this
Is prima facie evidence that Mr. Wil
son has determined to stand for but
one term. Nor is It. asserted that he
Is without other means of coercion
against congress. He never has an
nounced that he would not be a can
didate for re-election, and therefore
has ut his command all the influence
of the presidency that rests naturally
In the hands of a man who may bo
distributing th leave?, mid fishes for
four years more.
Ilclwcoti Two I Ires.
Rut U.is claimed that the tour of
the president Is the expedient of an
administration which bus readier a
critical point. Assailed on the one
hand by the .exponent of (borough
preparedness anil on the other by the
liryun pacifist propaganda, the ad
min 1st radon's moderate preparedness
plan lacks positive following and Is

1916. To fail in u ease which he car

Interpreted as a. correct premonition
that tho country is not with him. And
if the country be against a man why
should he run for president?
Depends Upon Reception,
Put those who have been associated
closely with the president say he may
fall, apparently, and yet not himself
gard It as a failure. He may not be
able to carry Ins projects through
congress, yet ns the result of' bisi
speaking lours satisfy himsvlf that
when the country goU to the polls It
will itlve him the support refused by
! congress. This, they say, is the worst
he can do. Ah n matter of fact they
j claim he will thrill the country and
i bring to bear upon congress such
! pressure from "back home" that his
I preparedness program will be forced
; through in a "uamsun nnisn. i
To Make I p Own Mind.
i it seems as if Mr. Wilson really
:were setting out on a deliberate tour
jof investigation, and that he proposes
to make up his own mind as to the
I second term, as be does in all other
! things.

office transmitted through James W.

on the part of French and Knglish
troops toward Herman prisoners. The
Hiitlsh government gives unqualified
denial lo the charges.
The note requests the Washington j
government to transmit a protest)
against "this violation of International
law" to both the Hrltlsh and French
governments. The instances of al
leged cruelty riled are:
"First, during the battle at Guise-1

officer ordered a severely wounded.
