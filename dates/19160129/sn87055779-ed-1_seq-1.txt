Pres't Wilson is not the chief at
traction on his flying visit through
the middle west to preach the doc
trine of preparedness. That was
plainly apparent when his party
made its first s:top here today.
It was Mrs. Woodrow Wilsor:, the
president's bride, who drew the
crowd that greeted the party here.
The president's train arrived at the
h'hady Side station at 9:31. A com
mittee of prominent Pittsburgh citi

president, Mrs. Wilson. Sec'y Tum

Omul Line Street.
In spite of the fact that tho sta
tion at which the piesident should
arrive was kept secret, crowds lined
the street all the way to the hotel
and they cheered the president and
Mrs. Wilson almost continuouosly.
It was plainly to be seen that Mrs.
"Wilson held the attention of tho
crowd. The president seemed to
realize that the cheers were more
for Mrs. Wilson than himself and
lie enjoyed it. He smiled happily all
the way, dotting hLi hat several
times in response to the more vig
orous outbursts of cheering.
It wg Pittsburgh'H first look at
the new first lady of the land, and
all Pittsburgh apparently was on
hand to take advantage of it. Mrs.
Wilson beamed happily on the
crowd and nodded her head several
times in acknowledgement of tho
upplause.

that address the president will ad
