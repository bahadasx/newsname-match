Ru.flin G.' Pleasant, who, was op-;
posed by Lieutenant Governor

state by obtatning the largest ma
p;rity ever given a D.fnocratic
andidfate for governor and defeat
[ing;Mr. Barret by some fifty thou
~sa* votes.
STle result of last Tuesday state
election in so far as the governor
and lieutenant governor were con
,>oerned came as a complete surprise
_R to the supporters of the victorious
capdidates, as well as to the Barret
and Fontenot people. It was ex
'pected that Barret would developl
streigth in the North Louisiapa
parishes and that Mr. Fontenot

Mr. Barret made a very poor show

showing of Fontenot the New Or

not be overcome.
Fred Clairborne gave Senator

MAYER HOME DAMAGED BY
ORE
The residence of Mrs. Mary Mayer
in the eastern portion of the. city,
caught afire Wednesday morning
and through the efforts of the Ope
lousas fire company only the roof
of the building was damaged.
It is supposed that the fire e
ginated from a defective flue; the
firemen were notified and in a few
minutes the flames had been quelled
and little damage had been done
the Mayer home.
W. D. Newmaun of Vernon is
charged with murder following the
death of W. H. Bridges who was

week ago.
D. M. FONTENOT IS DEFEATED
BY SHERIFF MARION SWORDS
A. L. Andrus Leads Charles Thibodeaux In Three
Cornered Race For Assessor; With Assurances
Of Final Success In Second Primary
Marion L. Swords, who has. oc
cupied the office of sheriff of St.
Landry parish, for the past sixteen
years, on last Tuesday emerged
victorious from another bitter po
litical battle, having defeated Da
rius M. Fontenot, present assessor
of St. Landry, for the Democratic
nomination by a majority of 96
votes.
Darius Fontenot made a splen
did race and had it not been for
the heavy majority receive I by
Sheriff Swords in the fourth and
firs. wards, the gallant yo'.ng cre
ole who made such a noble light,
would have won hands down, but
the Swords supporters i th )e two
wards stuck to their promise of
making these two wards deliver
the necessary'majority 4o put the
old sheriff in the lead.
Fontenot carried the third ward
by a majority of over one hu itr a.
votes; he carried the second by 96
votes, he led in .the 5h and 6th
wares by sma!: maj ri0i:, . Tha
rural polls such a ' Grani Prai'ie,
Coulee Croche, Leonville, Aruaud
ville, Mallet and Grand Coteau
gave Fontenot ove.lboimniig ma
jorities, but Opelousas, Eunice,
Washington and Melvi!ll gave
Sheriff Swords handsome majori
ties, which assured his election.
As expected A. L. Andrus led in a
three-cornered race for assessor by
a handsome plurality. A second
primary will be necessary will be
WIGGINS VICTORIOUS IN
EVANGELINE RACE
Lee Wiggins, for a number of
years a resident of this parish, but
for the pist four years a citizen of
Evangeline, has been. declared the
Democratic nominee for sheriff of
Evangeline by a majority of 701
votes over the present incumbent,
Paulin Fontenot.
Mr. Wiggins, while a resident ofi
this parish, was one of the most
popular employees of the public
officials; he was chief deputy tax
collector under sheriff Swords for
several .years , after which he
worked in the clerk of court's of
fice under Yves Andrepont for six
years. Coming in contact with res
idents of the old parish of St. Lan
dry, which then comprised Evan
geline and St. Landry, he made
hosts of friends. A short while af
ter the parish was divided he
moved over into Evangeline and it
was not long before his friends had
him up as a probable candidate for
sJieriff.
The many friends of Mr. Wiggins
in this parish feel elated over the
result of last Tuesday's election in
Evangeline.
The New Police Jury
The police jury of St. Lanlry will
be composed of the followng mem
bers for the next ensuing four
years:
First ward: J. T. St. Cyr, H. Lar
cade and Sam Evans.
Second warid: Barousse Beaugh,
and John E. Dailey.
Third ward: Dr. F. O. Pavy and
Antoine Lanclos, Jr.
Fourth ward: K. T. Catlett, Wal
ter Brown and J. B. Babington.
Fifth ward: Theodore Doucet,
Alexandre Sylvestre and Fred Mar
tin.
Sixth Ward: Allen McCoy and
Willie Dejean.
Judging from the newly elected
members of the police jury it ap
,pears that St. Landry will be able
to boast of one of the t pro
gressive juries in the 4 0ol d
nembers who were . are.
all good , .and
necessary to decide the plum be
tween Mr. Andrus and Mr. Charles
Thibodeaux.
That Mr. Andrus deserves the
office is shown on the face of - the
returns, as the majority of the
voters of St. Landry agreed with
the Clarion that Mr.:Andrus was the
most competent, ablest and best
aspirant for the office; he led his
two opponents and it would not be
surprising to see him defeat Mr.
Thibodeaux by an overwhelming
majority.
On Wednesday morning, aas soon
as all returns were in from the
country, the friends and supporters
of Mr. Andrus gathered in Opelou
sas to discuss plans for the second
fight.
With A. L. Andrus as assessor
the taxpayers of St. Landry will be
assured of a splendid and efficient
official. The assessor's office is
the most important in the parish,
as far as the property owners are
concerned and it is evident 'that
these property owners will safe
guard their interest by selecting a
competent and capable man like
Mr. Andrus.
The vote received by Mr. Andrus
at Eunice and Coulee Croche, the
home polls of his two opponents,
is indeed flattering. It'is now cer
tain that he will. run equally as well
at Coulee Croche, as he did last
Tuesday; and that he will carry
Eunice, as both factions there, it is
said, have endorsed Mr. Andrus.

Every Ward

Smajority of votes in the race for
city marshal, defeating Pickens
Butler by 199 votes.
The races for maypr and city
marshal were lost in the shoffie,
the' voters evincing considerably
more interest in the fight for sher

committee will probably show that
Mr. Swords secured a majority of
96 votes.
In next week's issue of the Clar

for assessor and sheriff.
