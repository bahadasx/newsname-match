OPEN WARFARE
ON PRESIDENT
North Carolina Leader Serves No
tice Big Group of Democrats
Will Fight Wilson's In
dustry Tax Plan.
HAS SPEAKER CLARK'S BACKING
Revenue Must Come from Surtaxes
and Levy on Muni
tions. DEMANDS STAMP TAX REPEAL
(From a Staff Correspondent.)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28. (Spe
cial Telegram.) A bitter struggle
between the Wilson administration
and the democratic leadersh ip In
congress over the manner of raising
revenue to give effect to President
Wilson's national defense bill Is fore
shadowed In a statement made public
today by Representative Kitchin of
North Carolina, the democratic
leader, in his fight against the pres
ident's proposal that moneys for de
fense shall be raised by stamp taxes
and Imposts on gasoline, iron and
steel tpoducts and a -lew other ar
ticles. Mr. Kitchin will have at his
back Speaker Clark and other Influ
ential party leaders,
Unless the president yields, the
fight over revenues will be pro
longed, with the probability that the
defense bills will be dragged down
to defeat In the melee.
The differences between the president
and a considerable clement of the demo
crats In the house, for whom Leader
Kitchin speaks, are clear and iharply do
fined. For Levy on Monitions.
In hla statement, given out today, Mr.
Kitchin, speaking as the chalrmun of the
ways and mean committee, which orig
inates revenue legislation, expressed the
"Pinion that funds for defense should be
raised by an Increase In, the surtaxes of
the Income tax law a,i da levy on muni
tions of war.
Ho declared without euulvacllon that
tho house would not re-enact tho stamp
features of tho war act, aa specifically
recommended by "lho president. Mr.
Kitchin declared further that the ex
emption of tho Income tax, now fixed at
S4,oiio for married men and 81,000 for sin
gle men, would not be lowered, aa recom
mended by President Wilson.
Leader Kltchln'a reply to the president.
. I . . . . . , I ft... .1. V.At.a
ajagayat AteJWray-anl iwn. fAmnutttee
Is a follows
"As chairman of ti e ways and means
eommlttee I am convinced that It is Im
possible to frame any revenue measure
and pass It through tho house that does
not place all appropriations for the In
crease of the army and the navy on tho
Income tax basis, and the exemption will
tot be lowered.
Repeal tor Stamp Taxes,
"I am convinced that we cannot put
through any revenue bill without prac
tically repealing all the stamp taxes of
the present emergency act. Undoubtedly
war munitions will be taxed also."
A good deal of significance Is attached
to the fact that this statement Is In
harmony with a formal announcement on
the question of revenues made public yes
terday by Spcuker Clurk. In that an
nouncement Mr. Clark said be was up
posed to stamp taxea of any kind, and
that he favored Increases In the surtaxes
of the Income tax law and a levy on
munitions aa the best way of obtaining?
funds for defense.
Today Speaker Clark, Mr. Kitchin and
other house leadens had a long conference
In which the revenue situation was dis
cussed at length, and an - agreement
reached that a fight should be made for
a revenue bill along the lines Indicated
in Mr. Kltchln'a statement.
Tax to Hit Wealth.
It may be stated upon authority that
Mr. Kitchin haa come to the conclusion
that tho plan of taxing- "wealth" as out
lined in bis statement, as against taxing
"Industry" aa recommended by the presl
aent, was reached as a result of ex
pressions made to him by approximately
seventy-five democrats of tho house. This
notice was to the effect that unless the
additional revenues needed for prepared
nesa were gained through the medium of
the Income tax, war munitions, and pos
slble an inheritance i:f. they would fight
the national defense and the needed tax
ing bill tooth and nail.
lth this notice before him, coupled
with Inquiries made on his ow naccount,
3Sr. Kitchin decided that the administra
tion revenue plan could not be put through
tUo house.
U. S. Asks Austria

commanders have knowledge of the
destruction of the British liner Persia. A

ceived here.
World- Wide Peace
"It haa not only brought peace to
Mexico, but haa shown the way to
Latin-America, and laid the fonnda
tlon for peace and reformation of the
world."
Continuing. General Carranza re
ferred to General Alvaro Obregon as

Belligerents Asked to Make Agree
ment to Square Submarine
Warfare Principle! of
Humanity.
FIVE PROPOSITIONS SUBMITTED
Under Changed Condition! It ii
Held that Merchant Ships
Should Be Unarmed.
SHOULD BE CALLED CRUISERS
RtM.KTIN.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 28. The
Italian liners America and Verona
will be permitted to aatl from New
York If the Italian government give
assurances, as It did In the case of
the Gulseppe Verdi, that their guns
will be used only for defensive pur
poses. WASHINGTON, U. C, Jan. 28.
The United States, in asking all
Huropean belligerents to make a gen
et al agreement to square tholr sub
marine warfare with the principles
of humanity and International law,
ha taken the position that under
changed conditions of naval warfare
merchant ships should carry no
aimament whatever.
All the powers hare been notified
teat unless they subscribe to such
principles armed merchantmen will
be denied entry to American porta
except under the conditions which
apply to warships.
Such a proposal, now in the hands
of the belligerent governments, hss
been transmitted In a note which is
substantially aa follows:
"It Is aasumad that all of th govern
ment addressed are equally desirous of
protecting their own subjects and cltt
sena, who ar non-combatants, from th
ha sards of submarine warfar.
"Realising the appalling loss of life
of non-combatant which rasulta from
th destruction of a merchant vessel
without removing passengers and ers
to places of aafcty, which is held to be
vtolatlv of th principles of humanity
and International law, th United State
at the same Unit doe not feel that a
belligerent should be deprived ef the
right to use submarine (a view of the
usetvilnea- whli;h thy hav developed.
"That a formula may be found Com
pletely within th rule of International
law and of humanity which will require
In .It adoption only a trifling Chang In
th practices which hav obtained In tho
past and before th war, which formula
would be just and fair to all belligerents,
It to proposed that:
Klrst, a nonoombatant has th right to
traverse the high seas la a merchant
ship sntltled to fir a belligerent flag and
rely upon-the rule of International law
nil the prlnnlplea of humanity If the
vassal la approached by a belligerent war
vessel.
Heoond, a merchant vessel of any na
tionality ahould not b subjected to at
tack until the belligerent warship has
warned It to atop. t
Third, any bellUerent-owned merchant
vessel ahould promptly obey anv order
