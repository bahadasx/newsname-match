CHICKENS DEMORALIZED
BY NEW STREET LIGHTS
Not the Kind of Chickens You Think, But - he Other Kind
?Read the Sad Tale.
Objections one atter another are
coming Into the offices of the city com
misaloners today' regarding the new
lights. One objection la that the
youag Lotharios of our fair city can
find no spot fit to walk where they can
slip their hand in the young lady's
arm.
Another Is that those who have chick
ens cannot sleep as the feathered spe
cie crow all night long. Harmon Lem
ley of Lomiey street, says that his
chickens crowed all last night. When
they got tired crowing they started
to fight, and simply would not go to
roost as long as tfie artificial sun kept
glaring into their coop.
Another objection, but one that will
not worry the authorities much, comes
from youthful auto drivers who can
be recognized as they.go through the
city streets at 60 miles an hour.
The police too, cannot slip off their
beats without being seen and In gen
eral the new lights are either a whole
lot of blessing or a nuisance?depend
ing entirely upon the viewpoint.

PAW PAW PEOPLE
DISCUSS ROADS
' ' '
[Petition For Bond Election
Prepared at Meeting
Here Today.
Paw Paw district in this county will
have about twenty-flvo miles of per
manent hard surfaced roads If the
proposed bona Issuo carrlcs at a spec
ial election to be held for that purpose.
A committee of prominent citizens
representing the towns In the district
met this afternoon ? at the office; of
the County Engineer Wilfong to pre
pare the petition, for the election and
to decide what kind of road shall be
built
Tho names of the men who attend
ed the meeting are:, Shrewsbury Mil
ler of Fairmont, Dr. Q. R. Miller of
Falrview who Is the committee at
large, John F. Phillips and Frank Ar
nett of Rivesville, E. J. Parker and W.
D- Ice of Hoodaville, C. A. Phillips
and J. A. McCoy of Grays Flats, Jake
Greaser and. J. Y. Hamilton of Fair
view. ,
It is likely that several different
kind of roads will be built if the bond
Issue carries, but lt.,wlll all be per
manent and with a hard surface. The
roads will all be graded and widened.
Brick may be used In a few of the
places where,the traffic is heaviest,
but the majority of the men at the
meting thiB afternoon think that a sin
gle or double course concrete road
would be sufficient. Some of the little
used roads In the district may only be
graded an dmacadamlzed.
The proposed bond isue is for $360,
000, and will cover all the estimates
prepared by the oounty engineers for
the roads up Paw. Paw Creek from the
end of the Fairmont district pavement,
and on the other branch of Paw Paw
Creek and on Pharoah's Run, Benfleld
Fork and from Fairmont district line
beyond BarrackvlUe to Falrview. -
These roads will open up an enor
mous territory in the, county that la
now almost Inaccessible in bad weath
er. A Bplendld scenic drive will be
possible .starting from Fairmont over
the -Dakota road' and up. Ptfw Paw
Creek to Falrview returning either

Tony Falcone Tells Why He

Falcone Kicked in His Sleep
and This Caused Hos
tile Feelings.
Tony Falcone, Italian o? many name*
and a temper, ia in the county jail
iiere awaiting hearing on a charge of
feloniously 'assaulting Nick Chinella.
Falcone -was, brought here last night
by Constable Findlay of Monongah
and taken to the Jail -where he told
a rather straight story of the Incident
as It took place in their boarding house
where boih men stayed.
For some time Chinella and Falcone
according to the prisoner, had slept
in the same bed. Chinella has heen
constantly arguing with Falcone about
kicking in his sleep and keeping Chi
nella awake. The arguments led to
slurs and finally to such bad feeling
between the two men that a light waB
necessary to settle it.
Falcone, who while working in the
mine, mashed a finger and had been
staying away from the mines. He
says that the story told by the board
ing mistress about losing money in a
game of pool and also that intimation
that he was jealous of Chinella's job
were faked and that there was nor
thing wrong between the men except
that the fight had its origin in
the arguments ensuing from the mck
ing in bed ,
When he saw Chinella Wednesday
night he became riled at the latt=r's
derision and grabbing a pick that was
handy, stuck it in Chinella's head
Falcone will be held until Chinella s
recovery to answer a charge of felon
