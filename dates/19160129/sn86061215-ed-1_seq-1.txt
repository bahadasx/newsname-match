Belligerent Nations Told
What This Country Will

PASSENGER SHIPS
MUST BE WARNED
Carrying of Weapons Puts
Liners in Same Class
-5\ With Battleships
Washington, D. C., Jan. 28.—The
"United States, in asking all the Euro
pean belligerents to make a general
agreement to conduct their submarine
warfare in accordance with the prin
ciples of humanity and international
law, has taken the position that under
^changed conditions of naval warfare,
'merchant ships should carry no arma
*7 ment whatever.
All the powers have been notified
rthat unless they subscribe to such
Sr ''principles, armed merchantment will
%be denied entry to American ports ex
^1. ''cept under the conditions which apply
to warships.
Si
fifthe
4
-.(..Hue belligerent government has been
^transmitted in a note which proposes
'|that:
i4 First, a noncombatant has the right
to traverse the high seas in a mer
chant ship entitled to fly a belligerent
f^.Hag, and rely on the rules of interna
tr* tional law and the principles of hu
inanity if the vessel is approached by
a belligerent war vessel.
Second, a merchant vessel of any
nationality should be subject to attack
'i"if the belligerent warship has warned
her to stop.
Third, any belligerent owned mer
vessel should promptly obey any
er from a belligerent warship to
P.
ii Fourth, no such merchant vessel
should be fired upon unless she tries
to flee or to resist by force and even
|n such case any attack upon her by
'the warship must stop as soon as the
ifight or resistance ceases.
Fifth, only in case it should be im
possible for military reasons for the
warship to supply a prize crew or to
Sf^convoy the merchant ship into port
-will she be justified in sinking such
merchantman and in that case passen
gers and crew must be removed to a
jplace of safety.
P,of
if
8UBMARINE DEFENDED.
The note is understood to have con
tended that the submarine is almost
without powers of defense beyond the
ability to submerge to escape an ene
y. A gun even of light caliber on a
erchant ship successfully could de
fend her against a submarine.
t*.
Therefore, the note continues, there
can be no reason for the maintenance
even small caliber guns on mer
chant ships unless it is designed to
make them superior to submarines
IpSSand thereby deprive that class of war
dships of their undoubted right with
^safety to warn and search such mer
IL'chantmen. In reality, therefore, any
p^'such armament of a merchant vessel
now might be regarded as offensive
armament
If submarines should be required to
laptop and search merchant vessels be
IPlfore attacking them and to remove
S$he passengers and crews to places
pfof safety it is not fair that the sub
f^marlnes should be compelled to ex-
Ipose themselves to destruction at the
hands of merchantmen.
Therefore, by a general agreement
'•iamong the belligerents, submarines
B|-jjshould be required to adhere strictly
'f^ito the present provisions of interna
tional law to stop and search mer
fe^chant ships to ascertain their bellig
fe|erent character, and to remove the
^passengers and crews to safety before
sinking them.
On the other hand, merchant ves
sels should not be permitted to carry
[l&jany armament at all.
There is grave doubt of the legal
right to carry armament on merchant
ships and it is submitted that all na
tions should be animated by a desire
to save the lives of innocent persons
||and should not insist on the exercise
S|pf any supposed technical right.
The United States government has
been impressed with the arguments
that have been advanced in certain
quarters that any merchant vessel
which carries guns in any position ca
pable of use against warships has
forfeited her noncombatant character
and may be regarded as an auxiliary
cruiser and is seriously considering
the announcement of a purpose to
treat these vessels on that basis be
jffcause of the changed conditions in
^maritime warfare resulting from the
Introduction of the submarine and its
.defenseless character.
The foregoing is substantially the
|note which Secretary Lansing yester
day announced he had transmitted to
foreign power or powers." He
lecllned to discuss the subject fur
ler.

A9JIINST FURTHER
SEIZURE OF MAIL
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT MAKES
VIG0R0U8 PROTEST AGAINST
HIGH HANDED ACTS.
Washington, D. C., Jan. 28.—Great
Britain's interference with neutral
mails is the subject of a sharp protest
on the part of the United States in a
note* to the British government, the
text of which was published today.
The communication discloses that
diplomatic and consular dispatches
have been treated by British officials
in a manner regarded by the United
States as "vexatiously inquisitorial/
which practices are denounced as "un
warranted interferences."
The note also cites repeated seiz
ures of mail in violation of interna
tional law and challenges Great Brit
ian's jurisdiction over mails on ships
touching at British ports.
Attention is called to the fact that
"a strong feeling is being aroused"
in the United States by the IOSB of
valuable letters, while foreign bank
ers are refusing to cash American
drafts because they have no assur
ances that drafts are secure in the
mails.
Ambassador Page at London has
been instructed to make vigorous
representations to the British foreign,
office and press for a prompt reply.
Great Britain's tentative reply, made
public with the text of the American
note, promises without "unnecessary
delay" to give the results of a consul
tation that is in progress between
Great Britain and her allies regarding
the policy to be pursued.
BRITONS FEARFUL
LEST SHIP IS LUST
BIG VESSEL FROM AFRICA
OVERDUE AND LIFEBOAT*
FROM IT IS SIGHTED.
IS
London, Jan. 28.—Grave anxiety is
felt regarding the British steamship
Appam, which left Dakar for Plymouth
on January 11, with 166 passengers
and 134 in the crew. When about four
days Out wireless communication with
the vessel suddenly ceased. A dis
patch from Hull to Lloyds says that
the British steamship Tregantle re
ports having passed at sea on Jan
uary 16 a lifeboat with the name Ap
pam painted on the stern and the
bow knocked away.
Concern has been manifested re
garding the fate of the Appam, many
days overdue on a ten day trip from
Dakar in the French colony of Seneg
al, West Africa, for Plymouth. In
the insurance market hope was nearly
abandoned and it was difficult to ef
fect reinsurance even at the high rate
of 75 guineas per cent
Two or three other steamships com
ing in the Bame direction as the Ap
pam are also overdue.
Among the 166 passengers on board
the Appam were colonial officials.
A report from Lisbon recently an
nounced that mines had been discov
ered in the Bay of Biscay.
The lifeboat with the name Appam
painted on the stem reported by the
steamship Tregantle was passed by
'that vessel in latitude 33.24 north,
longitude 14.32 west
LABOR FIGHTS MILITARY.
Bristol, Jan. 28.—The labor confer
ence adopted by a show of hands, with
one dissenting vote, a resolution
brought forward by the independent
labor party, demanding drastic revi
sion of the munitions act, with a view
to preventing "the pretext of the war
being used for greater coercion and
subjection of labor."
The conference adopted another re
solution proposed by Harry Goslin, as
follows:
"This conference, in view of the un
precedented situation that exists, ex.
presses the opinion that the best in
terests of the nation would be served
by the labor party representation re
maining in the coalition government."
The card vote for the
in
was the danger of a
labor movement. He hoped that a
united vote for the resolution would
do much to prevent that.

WAR IT TIMES
President Says Occasions
Arise When to Fight
Is the Proper Thing
BEGINS CAMPAIGN
FOR PREPAREDNESS
Will Start Out Tomorrow
on His "Speaking Tour
of Central West
New York, Jan. 28.—President Wil
son returned to Washington early to
day leaving a message to Americans
to prepare for a time when the Inter
national relations of the country may
not be so bright as today.
Frankly admitting his change of
mind on the preparedness issue with
in the year, he called on Americans
to insist on a body of 600,000 trained
citizens who will serve as a national
military reserve immediately avail
able under conditions of danger.
His .utterances here were regarded
as expressing the keynote of the pre
paredness campaign throughout the
middle west on which he starts late
today. Hct spoke before the Railway
Business association, before a gath
ering of 700 clergymen and at the
banquet of the Motion Picture Board
of Trade.
"I cannot tell you what the Inter
national relations of this country will
be tomorrow," said the president at
the Railway Business association ban
quet," and I use the word literally.
And I would not dare keep silent and
let the country suppose that tomor
row was certain to be as bright as to
day."
Willing to Fight.
Applause greeted his assertions that
"I always accept, perhaps by some im
pulse of my native blood, the invita
tion to a fight'.' and that while Ameri
ca stands for peace, Its people are
"ready at any time to fight for the vin
dication of their character and their
honor."
Suffragists who attempted to ob
tain from the president a promise to
support a woman suffrage amendment
to the federal constitution were dis
appointed today by their failure to
elicit anything more than a reasser
tion of his opinion that the suffrage
issue should be settled by the states.
Not the least interesting phase of
the president's visit was his speech
to the Motion Picture Board of Trade
where his outspoken comments on
"liars" and their efforts to deceive him
as to the Mexican situation and the
expression of
hiB
jt«
views of men who
attempted to "humbug" him stirred
his audience to laughter.

"In a large measure," the statement
sets forth, "they are In control of the
banks and cattle loan companies at
the market centers. Under these con
ditions it is impossible for the seller
to meet the buyer on equal terms.
"The cost of meats to the consumer
is higher than ever before in the his
tory of the country, and we consider
an investigation to determine the
causes should be made," the state
ment continues.
