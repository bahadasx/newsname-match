DALLAS, Texas. Jan. 18. The
Texas Democratic executive commit

the presidential primary Clause of
the state primary law because It is
"vague and Incomplete" and for the
reason that the national Democratic

Vigorous attacks were made on the

Who's Out Russelling.
For many moons the name of
the Honorable Catnobell Russell lu,s
been before the voters of the state of
Oklahoma as typical of radical legis
lation. Hi- has advertised himself as
not "willing to lei bad enough alone".
We have always considered Mr.
Russell honest and conscientious.
We have seldom agreed with him in
political matters.
Russell has been knm ked within
Ins own part) as frenuenth as from
his political opponents.
The latest stunt among aspiring
Democratic politirians holding Jobs
higher in the party than Mr. Russell
is to use the senator's name to con
jure with. The power "that loves
prosperity" has found n politically
convenient to offer his Umbrella to
the property owners during a Camp
ball Russell Ujunderstorm, and then
whisper In their ear that "Campbell
Russell will get you if you don't
Wat I h out." By investigating the po
litical climate prior to the "storm"
there are certain personally excited
forces making for a bad mixture of
weather. Sometimes there must be a
CaUSS for a hero before the oppor
tunity for the exhibition of heroism
is possible.
The new stuge manager at Okla
homa City is frequently both cause
and effect.
However, we refuse to permit the
use of .Mr. Russell's name to conjure
political alliances from the ranks of
alleged political adversaries.
