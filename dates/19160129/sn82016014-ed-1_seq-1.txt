With a hope and unity such as lead
ers have not known since the Long
Rristow fluht of 1908. Kansas Re
publicans are in Topeka today to plan
for the co mi tie state and national
cam pa inns. More than 800 Republi
cans men and women from every
section of the state will tonight at
tend the twenty-fifth annual banquet
of the Kansas Day club. Yet the ban
quet is merely incidental. It is the
possibility of political developments
of state-wide concern which today
broupht the party leaders to Topeka
Politics from a dozen angles con
cerns the men who are today in con
ference in the hotel lobbies and the
state house. To the observer, are in
dications of party fealty that have
been sadly missing1 at the Repub
lican dinner parties of recent years.
In solemn, serious conference are the
men who have been at each other'3
throats during two state-wide cam
paigns. In the hotel lobbies are the
men who furnished the oil for the
Situbbs machine and fought and bled
and died for the Progressives follow
ing the Chicago convention of 1912.
They are in conference with the men
who directed the affairs of the Repub
lican League, directed the fire for the
Taft organization and conducted the
spectacular fight that sent Charles
Curtis back to the United States sen
ate. Roth Moose and Standpatter.
Both standpatter and progressive
came to Topeka to take a hand in th
political milling in advance of the
banquet. They will sit side by side
tonight at the annual party love feast

Asks $15,000 Alienation Suit.
An amended petition in the
alienation suit brought by Mae
Dalrymplc against Grant Dal
rymple, her father-in-law, was
f i led In the d i st rict court of
Shawnee county this afternoon,
citing the couses for action and
asking for damage to the amount
of $15,000. The plantiff and Karl
Dalrymplc, son of the defendant,
were married May . 1913, in
Kansas City and are the parents
of two children. Mae Dalrym
plc Is a resident of this county
while the defendant lives near
Salina. Mrs. Dalrymplc charges In
her petition that the father
alienated the affe-ticns of her
husband and caused him to be
come estranged from her. She
charges that the father told his
son that the plaintiff yas unchaste
and untrue to him; that their
child was illegitimate, and that
he otherwise sought to turn the
husband away from her. She
states that they left the Dalrym
plc home several times in order
to get away from the father's
influence but that lie followed
them and finally succeeded in
persuading the son to leave her.

OUR DAILY SNOW
White Blanket Thickened This Morn
ing; More Sunday.
Conditions were not at all improved
over the state this morning, more snow
having fallen in most parts of Kansas.
At some places the ice, snow and sleet
on the ground measure several
inches, and at no station in Kansas is
the ground bare of ice. The snow has
been a daily occurrence for the past
four days, and there is little prospect
of a cessation in the next few days.
Wire trouble continues, though rail
road and street car traffic is practical
ly normal- A 20-mile wind promised
more trouble to telegraph and tele
phone companies unless it abated be
fore night.
The forecast calls for generally fair
weather tonight with continued cold:
Sunday unsettled with snow; not quite
so cold. The temperature dropped
last niyht after 10 o'clock reaching a
reading of 16 degrees at 7 o'clock
this morning. The mercury continued
on the decline, and by 10 o'clock was
down to 10 degrees. It was expected
to go several degrees lower later in
the day.

BOLINGERJN SUIT
Topeka Attorney Sained in
Kline Divorce Case.
j Sensational Details Brought
Out by Husband.
Painting pictures of night automo
bile rides, trips to Kansas City, visits
to cabarets and theaters, all spiced
with beer and wine, Roy W. Kline
today filed an answer to his wife's pe
tition for divorce, naming Arthur J.
Bolinger. a Topeka attorney, as the
man who alienated his wife's affec
tions. Kline doesn't file a counter petition.
He doesn't ask for a divorce. He sim
ply asks for the costs of the case, to
have Bolinger's actions Investigated by
the court and asks that the supreme
court be memorialized with a view to
securing the disbarrment of the To
peka attorney.
The Kline answer breaks the local
record for furnishing details. It gives
the hours and minutes for things al
leged to have taken place between
Ella Kline, the plaintiff in the orig
inal divorce petition, and Bolinger,
who signed her petition as attorney.
Denies Wife's Allegations.
Kline makes general denial of state
ments made in his wife's petition for
divorce but doesn't waste a great deal
of space on that feature of this reply.
In the third paragraph he brings in
the name of A. J. Bolinger, who is
representing Mrs. Kline in her divorce
action. He charges that Mrs. Kline's
: real motive in applying for a divorce,
according to her own statement, is
j that she loves another man. He
j charges her with gross misconduct
f with this man, and names Bolinger.
The petition states that Mrs. Kline,
became acquainted with Bolinger
i about the middle of November, 1915,
I and that up to that time their mar
! ried life, since they were married in
! 1910, had been happy. It states that
; Bolinger immediately began to make
j advances to Mrs. Kline, "such as are
j not customarily accepted by married
; women." that he took her riding and
j in fact became very intimate,
i It is recited in the petition that Te
j cember 13, Bolinger took the woman
i riding in an automobile and that at
I 9:30 o'clock that evening the ride
i ended at a hotel nar the Santa Fe
j station, that Bolinger left her at the
; hotel but that before doing ho he
gave her $ 1 0 with which to pay her
expenses at the hotel that night and
I her fare to Kansas City the following
j morning.
j Followed Her to K. C.
j The next morning. December 14, the
I petition continues. Mrs. Kline went to
' Kansas City and Bolinger followed
; during the afternoon, met Mrs. Kline
and went to Nance's cabaret, where
i they had supper and beer. From there

San Francisco, Jan. 29. The storm
that has raged over the Pacific coast
region since early Thursday has claim
ed a toll of not less than 60 lives and
caused property loss amounting to
millions of dollars, according to re
ports thus far received.
It Is feared that further loss of life
may be reported when lines of com
munication are cleared. The greatest
loss of life occurred in the Otay val
ley, south of San Diego when the low
er dam of the California mountain
water company broke Thursday after
noon. Not less than fifty per cent ac
cording to figures reported by the cor
oner's jury, lost their lives and scores
are missing. The Pacific claimed three
lives early yesterday morning when
the garbage carrier Aberdeen of Oak

been recovered.
High Winds Wreck Oil Field.
Flood waters and high winds did
much damage in various parts of tne
state. The oil districts in particular
have suffered severely, hundreds of

generally throughout the northern
part of the state. Telegraph and tel

the state which was generally demoral

restored. The storm struck the north
western states heavily, Oregon, Wash

cold and snow.
Montana last night was shivering

Instead, Convention in Topeka
to Select Delegates.
VICTORY FOR STANDPATTERS
Muhane y Crowd Kefnsed to
Yield" to Primary AVhin.
Morgan" Suffrage Resolution,
' However, Stood the Strain.
' Members of the - Republican ntate
committee today walked on the W. Y.
Morgan plan for compulsory presiden
tial primaries. T'nder an amended call
presented by D. W. Mulvsne of To
peka, the state convention to select
delegates at large to the Chicago na
tional convention, will be held in To
peka Tuesday, March 21. The basis
of representation v. ill be one delegate
and one alternate for every 200 votes
cast for J. T. Botkin for secretary of
slate in 1914 a conventio i of 962
delegates.
Fighting almost unaided and alone.
W. Y. Morgan of Hutchinson, ll.uten
ant governor, put before the state
committee the state administration's
program for compulsory local pri
maries. M rgan's resolution called
for the holding of primaries in every
township and precinct in the state to
select delegates to the county conven
tions, which in turn would name dele
gates to the state convention. Con
servative leaders of the party from ev
ery section of the state jumped on
Morgan's scheme wit h hob nailed
shoes.
Under the resolution by Mulvane,
option is given the local county com
mittees concerning the method of se
lecting county delegates. If a primsrr
is desired In one county and a caucus
is sought in another county, both dis
tricts are eared for. But Morgan
sought to uphold the primary system.
He urged the delegate to remember
the pledges of the party and the fact
that the Republicans who had writ
ten the law must keep sscred the spirit
of the act. His plea fell on deaf ears.
Victory for Stflnripnttcrn.
The Morgan-Mulvane fight was th
hie1 contest before the state committee
and the feature of Kansas Day activi
ties. It was a distinct vietory for thm
conservatives of the party and ths
first time since the enactment of th
Mate-wide primary law that the party
has refused to yield to the whip when
the primary policy was brought Into
issue. Many county chairmen took &
positive stand against the primary
plan as outlined in the Morgan reso
lution, although they were quite will
ing that counties which favored t'n
policy might pursue their own course.
Al Williams, of Columbus, a candi
date for a place on the "Big Four"

supporters of the caucus and conven
tion system in a speech which flayed
