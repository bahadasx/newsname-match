the minister, "in connection with com
pulsion. No fewer- than 6,000,000 men
came forward to enlist. Some of them
were unfit for service, others were re

the railroads and for the mines. About

Thirteen Billion Gallons of Water Sud

San Diego, Cal., Jan. 29. [By radio
,of water thirty feet high swept down
0
I just south of here, devastating an area
fifty miles long and two miles wide,
The property damage, it is believed,
I will reach $1,000,000.
1 Another dam today is near the
breaking point, threatening additional
ruin to the valley. Scores of persons
were reported missing and it is be
lieved that a number of bodies- were
carried out to sea.
Rescue parties are attempting to
reach the scene, approach to which is
difficult owing to swollen streams and
the fact that all of the brldaes between
San Diego and the little vaUey have
been tarried away by the flood waters
of the last two weeks. All roads are
virtually impassable.
Hundreds of families, cut off from
communication from the outside world,
are believed to be threatened with a
food famine. Suffering among the
homeless is intense. Plans are being
made here to rush relief supplies to
the flooded districts.
Failed to Heed Warnings.
Twenty-five farm houses are known
to have been swept- away- by the
waters.,..Th? h«tavy ^in- durtag.-the.
past two days iflfled* the lbwer, Otiy"
dam'for. the first time in Hs history.
Realising the .dam was weakening un
der the .great pressure of water, warn
ings were sent to the people In the
valley to flee. It was unheeded by
man, according to reports here.
There has Been no means of com
municatlng with the valley either by
telephone or telegraph since the gale
and rain-storm which swept this city
early Thittsday.
A^Utos Carry Relief.
Relief parties in automobiles and a
procession of motor trucks left here tb
day for the stricken Otay valley, fif
teen miles to the south. The motor
tri^cks carried provisions for the sur
vivors in the valley, and tools and
pontoons for fording swollen
where bridges are out The pace of^^e
relief expedition, ^s jhought would,
depend upon the slower jehicies
The city, some fifteen miles up San
Diego bay from the entrance of Otay
•creek, was in no direct danger from
the flood at any time, but its water
supply, coming largely from the sys
tem of which the lower Otay,dam was
a part, was curtailed today and -Na
tional City and Chula Vista, suburbs,
were reported cut off from usual water
sources altogether.
Damage Near Dam Greatest.
Persons familiar with the country
said today that the loss of life and
the greatest damage undoubtedly oc
curred close to the dam,'and that in
the lower valley, which is broad, prop
erty damage would be great, but loss of
life unlikely.
The dam Is one of a series of dams
and reservoirs by which a magnificent
water supply was assured the city of
San Diego, not only for the present
but with provisions for decades of
growth and expansion. This system,
considered among the'best, comprised
four dams and reservoirs, of which
three had been built. Behind the lower
dam was built the upper Otay dam .of
reinforced concrete. The upper' Otay
dam, eighty-four feet high, had a wa
ter shed of only twelve square miles,
while that of the lower Qtay was 100
square miles, including that., of, the
upper Otay.
The lower Otay, below the confluence
of two creeks which fbrm Otay creek,
received not only the full drainage of
-this watershed but also waters brought
north from Cottonwood creek.
The augmented burden in the unpre
cedented rain, was too great, Vi-i ?.,,

Levlngston $28,123.12. He. sued for the
recovery* including Interest
on the. pjirchase
This to on# df the largest judgments
ever given in a clvjl sfllt In the Chi
cago federal coflrta.
The three defendants ordered to re
imburse Levingston are William
Young, Conn Humes, and Herbert O.
Tomlinson, former heads of the defunct
Tomlinson-Humes, Inc., a de luxe book
and picture concern, and James Plunk
ett, former agent for the company, who
aided in unloading the collection on
'Levingston.
Three others were included ln the or
iginal suit. A verdict of not guilty was
returned in favor of Edward J. Mc
Ardle three weeks ago by direction of
Judge Carpenter. Samuel War field has
never been apprehended, and the case
against William Beer, librarian of the
Howard Memorial library in New Or
leans, who collected the books and gave
Humes an option, was dropped because
of a pending case against him ln New
Tork concerning the same collection.
The Jury was out five hours. In his
charge Judge Carpenter gave instruc
tions to deduct from the. judgment, in
the event of a verdict of guilty, an
amount sufficient to cover the value of
the books. The verdict represents the
amount paid by Levingston, witji in
terest at 6 per cent, less one-half of
the value of the collection as flxfed by
experts, which was $10,000, Thq ver
dict thus cuts the valuation to #6,000.
There are 6,000 books In the collec
tion. It was oharged by the prosecu
tion that much of the stuff was worth
less, consisting of seed catalogs, annual
reports of government departments,
and advertising matter relating to trips
ln Mexico and South America. The
books were shipped to the federal
building in fifty big packing cases.
Judge Carpenter set the hearing of
a motion for a new trial for Feb. 28.
In the event of an order of execution
of the Judgment It will be difficult to
collect, it was said, because the three
defendants claim they have no funds.
It was rumored, however, that efforts
will be mado within a few day to reach
a settlement with Levingston.

BRYAN CHALLENGES WILSON.
President Is Urged to Permit People
to Get Light.
Miami, Fla., Jan. 29.—As a bon voy
age message to President Wilson upon
his departure for an "appeal to the
country" on preparedness former sec
retary of State Bryan today issued a
statement challenging the president
to outline his reasons for urging na
tional defense measures. Bryan gave
no hint as to his future personal plans
In that connection.
"I cordially commend the president's
plan to lay before the voters his rea
sons," Mr. Bryan said. "The people
are entitled to all the light possible
In order that they may Intelligently
advise their public servants.
"If he can convince the people he
will be entitled to their support If his
reasons fail to convince he will have
no excuse for going further with hla
program."
Further outlining his reason for op
posing preparedness, Bryan said:
"The sum which the president asks
for the army and navy would absorb
almost the entire income of all United
States farmers. An adoption of the
president's program would work a
complete revolution in our national
ideals, ln our governmental methods,
and in the character of influence w»
are to exert upon the world.
"The question is not whether we
could or would defend ourselves tf at
tacked. We not only could, but would,
but our preparedness is increasing del
atlvely more rapidly as the\belligerent
nations exhaust themselves.
"A large part of the democratlo
party and a considerable portion of the
republican party are satisfied with our
nation as it is, and prefer to continue
the present scale of preparedness, with
any risks which it may Involve, rather
than risk a change ln the European
plan with lljs oppressive tactics and its
menace to peace, and international'
friendship." .e-
