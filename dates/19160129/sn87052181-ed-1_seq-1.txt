By EDWARD B. CLARK.
OSEPH EDWARD DAVIES,
ono time commissioner of
corporations, and now tho
chairman of1 tho federal
trado commission, Is a Celt.
IIo shows It In his face, his
mannerisms and his meth
ods of work. His father was
a Welshman who came to
this country sixty odd years
ago. Joining a Welsh colony In south
ern Wisconsin, a colony hardly sec
ond, It Is said, In slzo and In tho
mark which It mado on the state, to
that which entered Into tho life of
central New York much more than
half a century ago.
Tho Celtic people are moro or less
emotional, nnd perhaps the accent
should be placed on the moro rathor
than on tho less. In tho greater men
whom tho Celts havo contributed to
public life, tho emotionalism while
marked, has always shown tho effect
of the steadying hands of thought and
of conscience. Emotionalism does not
run away with Lloyd-George of Wales
and of England, nor does It run away
with his cousin, Joseph E. Davles of
Washington and Wisconsin, for this
chieftain of the federal trade commis
sion Is a, cousin of the man now most
In tho public eyo In the British
Islands.
It is within tho range of possibilities
that If two or threo years ago some
great corporation ofllclal of tho United
States should have consulted a for
tune teller sho would havo looked at
his palm and said: "Look out, for a
dark, handsome man Is about to stand
In your path." Mr. Davic3 Is a dark
man, and it is no flattery at all to
say that ho Is a handsome one. Ho
became tho commissioner of corpora
tions soon after Mr. Wilson -was In
augurated president if tho United
States. Many men had picked Joseph
E, Davles for a cabinet position, and
thoro aro thoso to say that the proph
ecy of such a placo for him event
ually may not go unfulfilled. The
bureau of corporations, as Us namo
Implies, looked aftor corporation mat
ters. It was a check on Illegal doings
on the part of great concerns of tho
country and, It was nlso Intended as
a help to such corporations as wanted
to obey tho law to tho last letter and
who wanted to know definitely Just
what tho lattor was.
Josoph 13. Davles Is. a man of con
siderable brawn, and ho would not
bo whero he Is probably If he wcro
not a man of moro than considerable
brain. He comes by both by Inherit
ance, for his father was n bluc'ksmlth,
of "tho muscles of lils bruwny-arms-wero-strong-as-lroii-liaiids"
species. Mr.
Davles' mother was tbo daughter of a
lmrrlBter. Sho wns of Welsh and
French extraction, thereby keeping
tho Colt blood In Mr. Davlos virtually
undiluted. The mother was one of

becoming one at tho ago of twenty
two years. Sho camo to this country
many years ago on a lecture tour. At
Watertown, Wis., Bho met and married
the father of tho present chief of tho
federal trado commissioner.
There Is ono incident In the career
of Joseph E. Davles which Washington
politicians account remarkable. Tho
chairman of tho trade commission, as
everybody knows, Is a Democrat.
After Mr. Wilson had been elected
men all over tho country began to
writo to him urging tho appointment
of the Wisconsin man 'o a cabinet po.
sltion. Mr. Davles knew nothing
about these efforts In bin behalf. His
mother was In England and 111. The
son went abroad to caro for her and
to bring hor back to this country as
soon as she was ablo to travol. Ho
was compelled to stay In England for
months and was entirely out of di
rect touch with political affairs and
his own concerns In this land.
At that tlmo the Wisconsin legisla
ture was Republican. In tho body
wcro a good many former students of
the University of Wisconsin, of which
Mr. Davles is a graduate. Ono night
four Republican members and a Demi
cratlc member of tho legislature hap
pened to meot. Tho Republicans said:
"Joseph Dnvlcs Is an nblo, high-mind-cd
mnn. Ho ought to havo a placo
In President Wilson's cabinet." it Is
necdloss to say perhaps that the
Democratic member coincided Instant
ly with what his Republican col
leagues had said.
Then tho Republican suggestion was
that tho scnato and assembly of Wis
consin should adopt resolutions recom
mending Davles for a cabinet position.
The Democratic moraber said, "That
would bo fine, but you can't get a
Republican legislature to do It."
What was tho result? The Repub
lican aBsembly by unanimous vote
passed tho resolution and tho Repub
lican senato instantly followed suit.
Joseph E. Davles Is under forty
years of age mid ho Is ono of a group
of young men whom President Wilson
culled as governmental aids In his
administration. In positions just bo
low' that of cabinet rank thero nro
today in Washington many young
men, or young ns the world looks on

ties which It must bear,
Ono lliula a genial host In tho of
fice of tho commission's chairman.
Mr. Davles has tho Celtic temperament
which makes for hospitality and good
nature Until a Celt reaches the point
of righteous Indignation und Is there
fore likely to explode, he is ns po
lite ns nature ever allowed any man
ti bo. It makes little difference wheth

characteristic is concerned, but thero
aro times when tbo fires break looso
nnd expend their flames on tho head
of the offender. It is said that ono
or two such things havo happened In
tho career of Joseph F Davles. Thero
nro a good many men in public llfo
and in business llfo who aro likely to
becomo offenders against the proper
ties of government nnd business, and
on such as theso tho Celtic temper
sometimes breaks.
There is one thing that Is certain,
Joseph E. Davles loves his home state,
and ho has an abiding affection for his
educational alma mater. He attended
tho public schools of Watertown, Wis.,
graduated from tbo high school in
1S94 with a clnss of which he was tho
valedictorian. He at onco entered tho
University of Wisconsin and was
chosen president of the freshman
class. On graduation ho was both
class day and commencement orator.
While ho was attending the university
he wns made athletic instructor. ,Ho
was one of tho winning team In tho
Illinois-Wisconsin intercollegiate- do
hate. He graduated In law In 1901,
and In the year following he was made
temporary chairman of tho Democrat
ic stato contention.
At the beginning of his administra
tion President Wilson gavo Mr. Davles
an opportunity to accept or decline
two high offices of government, tho
assistant secretaryship of war and
tho governor generalship of tho Phil
ippines. Both of these offices tho Wis
consin man declined. Later, however,
ho accepted tho position of commis
sioner of corporations, a placo which
his record In tho law made him oeem
peculiarly flL
Into the campaign of 1912 In behalf
of Woodrow Wilson Mr. Davles en
tered ns a battling flguro. Ho was a3
prominent In tho WlUon movement
lu the middle West and the West as
was the Princeton man, William H.
McCombs, In tho East. Mr. Davles
was a Wilson follower prior to tho
nomination of the present president
at Baltimore. At the convention ho
Joined forces with Mr. McCombs In tho
struggle which finally was successful
In securing tho president's nomination.
During tho election campaign Mr.
Davles directed tho Democratic forces
in virtually all the western and mid
dle western states.
Hero Is Mr. Davles' definition of tho
government body over which he pro
sides as chairman:
"Wo might put it this way," ho
said. "Tho trade commission U tho
trafllc police force to see that tho
rules of tho road on what wo may
term tho industrial highways of tho
nation are maintained. It is to com
pel the big touring car, in the uso of
thoso highways, not to disregard tho
rights of the llttlo one, hut to accord
it its duo share of the road." ,
Washington men havo characterized
this as a rather striking characteriza
tion of tbo functions of tho trade com
mission, Of course tho hlg touring
rai- Is "big business," and tho small
touring car Is "little business."
Tho government, over since men
began to think progressively, has
been trying to get fair trade condi
tions. Joseph E, Davles of Wisconsin
today Is at the head of tho commis
sion which has this work lu large part
In hand. He has not been long in
tho present ofllco. The future is ahead
of him nnd It is up to hHn to maka as
good In his now office as the records
show boyong cavil that ho has mado
good in other walks of llfo,
