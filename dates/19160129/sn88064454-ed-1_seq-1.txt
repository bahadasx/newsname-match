BIG PARKER MIBEETING
Sunday last John M. Parker ad.
dressed the people here, he was to
speak at the Bienvenu Theatre be
cause he was adverse to any speak
ing in the open air, but as the
theatre could not hold one third
of the large audience, it was deci
ded to hold the meeting at the
Evangeline park in order that all
be given a chance to hear the can
didate. The meeting was opened
by Dr. D. C. Labbe who made a
few remarks and took occasion to
tell to the large crowd that he was
a candidate for Sheriff regardless
of who was elected at the primary
election.
Dr. J. R. Olivier followed, made
some few remarks and introduced
Mr. Parker who made a short ad
dress, he went right to the point
and told the people why he was a
candidate and what he proposed to
do if he was elected. His remarks
were well received and Mr. Parker
was pleased with the large atten
dance of this meeting.
CATARRL CANNOT BE CURED
with LOCAL APPLICATIONS. as they
cannot reach the seat of the disease. Ca
tarrb is a blood or constitutional dis
ease. and in order to cure it you must
take internal remedies. Hall's Catarrh
Cure is taken internally, and acts direct
-ly upon the blood and mucous surfaces.
Hall's Catarrh Cure is not a quack medi
cine. It was prescribed by one of the
beet physelians in this country for years
ard is a regular prescription. It is com
posed of the best tonols known, combin
ed with the best blood purifiers, acting
directly on the mucous surfaces. The
perfect combination of the two ingre
dients is what produces sueach wonderful
results in curing catarrh.

Mr. Editor:
Would you kindly give space to
the following so that the public
may be appraised of the vandalism
that is being perpetrated in the
Cemetery: flower plants surround
ing the last resting place of depar
ted relatives that are lovingly cared
for by bereaved parents are dug
and carried off by evil minded and
mischievous idlers, and those, that
perchance are left to bloom, are
culled and pilfered for personal
adornment and home decoration;
thus showing their want of com
passion and their insensibility to
the distresses they cause to others;
it is inconceivable that human be
ings-Christians--can be so bereft
of the respect due to the dead and
to the "sacred place" wherein they
lie mouldering to ruthlessly dis
turb their ashes- to deliberately
commit such a descration as noted
above, an act repulsive to the re
fined and highminded the world
over--an act condemned even
by the heathen, by the Savage. A -
watch should be kept upon those
despoilers and when caught in their
nefarious work be severely punish
ed as a warning to others that may
be imbued with that same spirit of
sacrilegious and beastly instinct
that should belong only to that
class of the lower animals-to the
swine-to the omnivarous hog
that stupid animal which delights
to ".:dilow in the mire.
