Another big lain and snow
storm ocaurrecl in the Patagonia
country Wednesday. It was one
of the largest precipitations of
the season and seemed to be
general over this part of the
state.
Last Tuesday J. J. Casey came
in from the-Tom Reed mill, bring
ing with him the four bai s of bul
lion inac were secured irom a
cleanup for the month of Decern
ber. The bullion weighed some
thing less than 100, 000.
Jake Johnson sends word to
town from the Dixie, where has
been taking out ore for the past
several days, that he will soon
have a shipment ready. He says
everything is looking fine at the
lead mine. Patagonian.
Yuma Valley is not large, but
it is one of the most productiye
valleys in the world. Itis locat
ed in the southern end of Yuma
County, traversed by the Yuma
Valley Railroad, building, paved
highways, has good people, good
schools, good churches and the
most dependable government ir
rigation system in the world.

Casa Grande is about to take
the lead in the matter of municip
al ownership of public utilities.
Not only is this progressive town
to own its water and electric
light plants but it is to have a
municipal ice plant, which is to
furnish the citizens of the town
with the cold stuff at the rate of
fifty cents per one hundred
pounds. Tempe News.
John C. Wichmann, who re
cently took over the tungten
mines twelve miles east of Yucca,
was in Kingman this morning:
and reports that the shaft that
s being sunk on his group of
tungsten claims has reached a
depth of 40 feet and that a won
derful body of tungsten ore has
been opened. He is also driving a
drift on one of the veins and get
ting great ore.
One of the heaviest rain and
now storms ever witnessed in
Benson occurred this week. The
rain started early Wednesday
morning and about noon it turn
ed to snow. By night a blanket
of snow about two inches thick
covered the ground. It continu
ed to storm all day Thursday.
Some of the snow is still on the
ground. The storm did no dam
age in this vicinity and is a great
benefit to cattlemen and farmers.

Reclamation and development
of 12,000 acres of land lying east
of Maricopa on the main line of
the Southern Pacific railroad has
been begun by the Whyman
Land & Development company
of Phoenix, which has already
started work on the first of sev
eral pumps installed. A town-
site of 80 acres surrounding the
station at Maricopa is being laid
out and work on a new hotel and
office building for the company
and several new stores will be
under way within 30 days.
Such a storm. Not the oldest
resident of Courtland has any re
collection of as heavy a snow
storm as visited this community
during Wednesday and Wednes
day night and spent Thursday
and the forepart of the evening
tapering off. Automobiles, mo
torcycles, and even wagons were
given one full day of rest, there
being urgent need of some form
of a rotary snow plow to make
moving about possible, but de
livery wagons started moving
Friday, finding travel very hard!
The Blue Eagle in the Alum
Gulch is one of the prospects in
the Patagonia country which is
attracting very favorable atten
tion from mining men just now.
It is owned by Marshall McDon
nell, Lou and Harry Stevens and
Kane. -Work is being done in a
winze now down about 100 feet,
from which crosscuting to the
vein will soon begin. A tunnel
has been run on the property for
over 200 feet, and considerable
good ore is in sight. The cross
cut from the winze will strike
the vein at a greater depth and
give a big area of mineralized
ground to work. Patagonian.
The weather a few days this
week was exceptionally cold for
this locality. There being ice on
the water of mornings and the
hydrants were all frozen. It is
said that an oldtimer who had
lived in Yuma county until he
had become thoroughly acclimat
ed, after he had departed hence,
"came back from hell to get his
blankets." If that's the case
what, in hell, must that poor
soul and all the other Xumaites
for there must be many there
been doing this week to keep
warm. Gadsden Clarion.
The last rail of the Tucson
Gila Bend and Aio railroad, con
necting the Ajo district with the
outside world, has been laid and
the trains will be running be
tween Gila Bend, on the South
ern Pacific, and the new town of
Cornelia, which is growing up
around the big copper camp of
the Calumet and Arizona Mining
company. Finishing touches are
still to be made at various places
along the line, but to all intents
and purposes the railroad is now
completed. A regular train
schedule is expected to be in
ugurated in about three weeks.
SCHOOL FUNDS.
The work of distributing and
apportioning the money of the
state school fund among the
counties of the state, has been
completed, the sum amounting to
$320,186 94. From this amount
the sum of $15,815.51 is wildheld
for paying the rentals and other
incidental expenses of the school
department. Most of the money
is derived from the rental of
public lands which have been
set aside for the purpose of rais
ing an educational fund.
The apportionment is made on
the official school census of 1915
at the rate of $5.95 for each child
between the ages of 6 and 21
years. The last census gave the
number of children of school age
as being 56,471. Of this number,
Maricopa leads the state, its
number of school children being
13,533.

tributed, Apache, $6,498.52; Co

LET US BE READY.
Recently several of the mili
tary and other authorities have
said to successfully intervene in
Mexico 250,000 well trained, well
equipped men would be needed.
We now have about 80,000 in
differently equipped soldiers. In
the face of these facts, well
known to every member of the
houses of Congress, Senators
Borah and Lodge are in every
way urging a more aggressive
policy with the country.
Who of all of those who are ad
vertising and demanding inter
vention in Mexico would volun
teer their service? Let those
who would be willing to enlist
to fight in Mexico do the talking.
In that case much of the talk
about Mexico would cease.
Borah and Lodge could serve
their country better by helping
the president in making ready to
successfully protect our flag and
national pride from real foes.
The man or men in congress
who oppose the resident's plan
of preparedness will have trouble
in justifying their actions with
their constituents. The people
want everything in the fighting
line necessary to piotect the
honor, peace and quiet of these
United States. Arizona Gazette.
There Is more Catarrh In this section
of the country than all other diseases
put together, and for years it was sup

scribed local remedies, and by constant

local disease, greatly influenced by con
stitutional conditions and therefore re
