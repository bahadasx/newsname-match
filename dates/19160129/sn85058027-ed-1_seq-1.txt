Mill to Cost From ,'i,000 to 7.,000. i
Honry Johnson, secretary of tho Ta-
clfic Mining Company ictutned from a
Snlt Lnko Saturday with tho news j
that tho leasers of tho Pacific mlno i
had defintcly decided on erecting a i
mill In American Fork Canyon to 4
treat tho thousands of tons of sec- 4
ond grndo 4
ond class oio that Peter Miller" and us- 4
socintcs hnvo blocked out in tho big 4
l'acific fissure. 4
Tho size of tho mill has not yet 4
been dotormincd, but It is definatcly 4
given out that It will not coat less 4
thnn $25,000 nnd may leach $75,000, 4
tho exact slzo depending on certain 4
economic conditions that will develop 4
within tho next month. j
Tho Pacific nlrondy has thousands 4
of tons dovolopcd, student to keep 4
tho mill supplied with 100 tons por 4
day for an indcflnato time. Tho char- 4
actcr of tho sulphido oro 1b Idcnl for 4
milling purposes. It will probably bo 4
reduced to from 4 to 1, which itself
means n tonnngo of 25,000 tons per 4
day from tho mill oro alone. 4
Tho location of tho mill has not 4
been decided on ns yet, as it may I10 4
that arrangements will bo pcifcctcd 4
to hnndlo oros fiom tlicir other mines. 4
The architect will get out tho plans 4
nt once, mid Just ns soon ns winter 4
bleaks, work on construction will 4
commence. Tho construction of the 4
mill means that tho Company will ex- 4
crclso its option 011 nccuring tho 4
lease, tho first provisions of which' 4
oxptro about threo and. ono half years ,
hence. It also means that nt least
$50,000 In loyalties must bo paid ,to '
tho utockhoIdciH in this samo length
of tltno.
