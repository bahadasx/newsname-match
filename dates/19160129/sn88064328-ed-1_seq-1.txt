WOMAN AND WAR
By Grace D. Brewer.
Woman ami war! Woman and
war are not synonymous. They
are not thought of in the same
terms. They are antagonistic in
every sense. Woman hates war.
She hates it because it
away the darling son am
only to send them home mangl
or dead. Woman is at la^t dis
cover in it that war and its advo
steals
cates lia^'o been lying to her these
many ages. Tlicv have told her
that woman has a noble part
play in all great conflicts; that slu 1
must resign herself to her fate
and rejoice that her son and lath
er have been called to defend her
home and to die for the father or
mother land.
But it can no longer truthfully
•he said that the soldier uniform
captivates the heart of woman
and that her admiration of the
soldier hero is one of the things
that s| hi i men on to battle and (<
death. Woman now looks beyot#
the uniform of blue with its gift
tering buttons, the flashy mus
kels, the fine military display and
the martial music. The poetic and
sentimental side of woman and
war, if indeed there ever was
any, has vanished. She is he-J
pinning to see what her ances
tors, perhaps, failed to see, the
sordid hand of greed and the de-'
signing methods of 'kings and fi
naii<-inl mlir,.
The woman of today is not
afraid to voice lier protest against
militarism »ml pro,. «r„In^

There is I 'll continuation of
these pnjilii'Ttons in the over

Pleasant and in the fact that
more than 101), (MIO voters went t<
th«' polls and participated in the
selection of 'he nominee.
The fwo local organs of Mr.
Parker worked insidiously to pre.j
udice t ? *e electorate against both
Pemoerht ic carulidates, belittling
their abilities and repr-s« nt in"
them as inferior to Mr. Parker.
This campaign was especially di
reefed against Fol. Pleasant, to
whose political destruction these
newspapers have devoted their
energies within the past three
years.
In nomiiiatimg Mr. Cleveland in
the convention of 1S02, (Jen.

are willing to he guided by news
piipers which have ulterior pur

They are l»Iin«l who do not see
in the result the utter hopeless

The small falling off in the vote,

here We expect to see twisted into
an argument in his favor. But
aside from the fact that this argu

of which the registration rolls re
main unpiirged, the city vote it
self is prophetic of what is to
come. K
'.veil if it 'be granted that
several thousand voters remained
away from the polls intending to
vote for Mr. Parker, the phe
nomenal vote rolled up by the
organization and its support'-' -
for Fol. Pleasant, greatly exceed
ing the high-water poll for Mr.
Michel, timaiis that the maximum
vote Mr. Barker can possibly poll
here falls under 10,000, several
thousand less than (luv. Ilall re
ceived and even (ïov. Hall was
beaten by 10,(MM) votes. Mr.
Parker is bound, therefore, to be
much worse beaten than Gov. Hall,
Tlie outlook is even bleaker for

day's vote shows that, outside the
Third District, the bulk of the
white voters is still true to Bem

THE MANN ACT AND
BLACKMAIL.
The Mann act was a laudable ef
fort to «'heck I lie while siav «•
t rallie. I '.lit since it has been
found to have a weak point where
misconstruction can creep in, it
has been a fertile source of ii hi 11 e\
making for hlackmaileis. The
Federal (Jovernnieiit has reecnlly
unearthed an organize«! gang of
'men and women who lia.e been
using the Mann Act is an « ■ « n .«•
to get hush money in l ir - " sums
from unwary victims, most of
whom I'erc led into ttieid dilli
culties by members of fin' \ r i g.
Insofar as th«- Mann Act has
become an invitation to '
mailers, it ought to lie imp-'
But blackmail existe,] iotr.r h
the passage of this law, and it
finds a thousand forms i idej
ent of it.
The only safe thing for a per
son threatened with blackmail ;
to. inform th« police, stand his
ground, and face the necessary
publicity. Many innocent people
caught in some situation which
could be misconstrued have paii
blackmail, fearing that if th
fair were made public the truth
would not be believed and their
reputations wo.ild suflVr. Doc
tors and lawyers with growing
children to protect have often
come into this class. But it is
never safe to pay blackmail, no
matter what the conditions, or
what the threats. The one who
has paid anv ^um at all f<. a black
mailer is, if the secret comes out,
branded by his fear as guilt v.
And payment is no security
against publicity. It is the chitT
characteristic of the blackmailer
that he cannot be trusted to keep
faith.
