Known Dead 25 and This I
Blown Down In Oil Districts Cause Loss of $3,000,000
-Two Other Big Dams In Danger of Breaking-Valley
I of Orange Groves Two Miles Wide and 15 Miles Long
Devastated by Resistless Torrent
San Diego, Cal., Jan. 29. It is estimated that more
than 25 persons were drowned when the Lower Otay
reservoir dam burst here yesterday. A wall of water
thirty feet high tore down the Otay valley with express
train speed. Some estimates place the dead as high as 50.
Only four bodies have been recovered.
The first intimation of the disaster was when bodies
of animals, pieces of furniture and bits of houses were
observed floating in the bay opposite the San Diego water
front. '
When the dam broke those who had not heeded the
warning and fled from their homes, had no chance,
A colony of thirty Japanese is believed to have been
engulfed.
The only stories of the disaster available are furnished
by a few ranchers, who viewed the disaster from nearby
hills. They said the dam burst with a roar audible for
many miles. A sea of water spread down the fertile val
ley, obliterating orange groves and ranches, carrying on
its crest a whirling mass of houses, bodies and trees.
The valley of Otay on the railroad to Tia Juana was
wiped out and the Tia Juana railroad cut. It is believed
possible that a few survivors are marooned on islands in
the middle of the flood now running but all efforts to
reach them have, failed and they are further imperilled
by the imminent danger of
ine Dig sweet water aam is reported dangerous and
people who live below it are in flight.
The Otay dam broke Thursday afternoon, but the
country is so completely isolated that there was no hint of
the catastrophe until the wreckage was seen within
the bay.
The territory devastated is two miles long and 15
miles wide. It has been under cultivation since 1895.
Damage is estimated at more than $1,000,000.
When the dam collapsed 11,500,000,000 gallons of
water were released. San Diego policemen and firemen
with many volunteers have been rushed to the scene to
attempt rescue of possible survivors.

That section of the state is locked in
by blizzards and shnoiv drifts 30 to 40
feet high. Wire service is interrupted,
while traffic at points is utterly impos

C'umbres Pass is stopped, as the Bockies
are under 30 feet of snow.
Silverton, surrounded by rugged hills,
is in danger of being buried by aval
anches, one of which already imperilled
several hundred miners and $00,000
worth of property.
An avalanche hammering down
through tho mountains near Eockwood
swept two empty outfit cars on the

into the l.as Animas river, a sheer drop
of 1.000 feet.
Three conches containing 30 passen

The blizzard has cut off livestock,

of the higher altitudes. At Cunihresw

"Nation Mur Stand Willi

NOTE OF GRAVE WARNING
RAN THROUGH ADDRESS
Made Short Talk to Great
Waiting Throng That Could
Not Get In Building
Tittsbiirg, 1'a.. Jan. 20. Warning the
American people that entirely "new
circumstances have arisen for which
the country must prepare itself," Presi
dent Wilson today asked that all "tend
to the business of preparing not for
war, not for aggression but for nation
al defense."
Through his speech, there ran a strain
of grave warning that perils may be
just ahead. Dangers to America, he
termed "grave and constant."
"Thrust aside your personal ambi
tions," he counselled, "and act for the
we;f..'-e of the country."
"The struggle abroad has now last
ed a year and a half; the end is not
vet and all the time, things are getting
more and more difficult to handle. 1 1
all could see the dispatches I read every
hour they would know how difficult it
has been to maintain peace.
"We are in the midst of a world we
j cannot niter, and therefore as your re
i sponsible servant, I must tell you that
jthe dangers arc grave n ml constant.
"We are even dependent now upon
the belligerents for the movement of
our commerce.
Must Forget Politics.
"Where there is contact, there is
likely to be friction, and with nations!
engaged as many now are in a life and I
death struggle, they nre likely to be
come stubbornly steadfast in their pro
posals and convictions."
The president's words stirred more
than fi.000 persons crammed into Me
morial hall. Nearly as manv more were
iinclccd into the second floor of the
buililinf. hoiiiiiL' that the executive
would address them later. Yet others

BERLIN TOLD AMERICA'S
PATIENCE IS EXHAUSTED
Dilly-dallying Methods of Ambassador Von Bernslorff la
Dealing With Secretary of State Over Lusitania Matter
Must Give Way To Definite ActionSoldiers of All
Entente Nations Landed In Greece Conflicting Reports
From Western Front
Washington, Jan. 29. That the Lusitania negotiations
with Germany are again assuming very grave proportions
was admitted by officials today.
The administration has caused Germany to under
stand that prompt compliance with the American demand
for disavowal of the torpedoing is necessary if the Teu
tons desire to avoid a break in friendly relations with the
United States. Further, Germany has been informed that
if her next reply shows a continued desire for delay in
granting satisfaction, grave consequences may ensue.
The administration, too, has let Berlin know that its
patience is taxed over the German dilly dallying evi
denced in Lusitania conversations Ambassador Von
Bernstorff has had with Secretary of State Lansing.
Secretary Lansing, however, made it clear today that
the situation had not reached the ultimatum stage, no
matter how plainly Berlin has been given to understand
America's position. Concerning the report that Germany
had been given until February 5 to disavow the torpedoing,-he
declared that "there is nothing in it."
Meanwhile the administration anticipates favorable
responses to the identical note sent to all belligerents
seeking establishment of new and universal principles of
international law affecting submarine warfare. More
difficulty, however, is anticipated in getting pledges, as
desired, that the Jidligerents will not arm merchantmen.
However, if this provision is rejected, the United States
will insist that no armed merchant ships visit American
ports. '
Athens, Jan. 20.- Soldiers of all the
entente nations have landed on llreek
soil.
Salonika dispatches today told of tho
debarkation of an expedition of marines
from French, Hritish, Italian antl Ku-
siiin warships Friday at daybreak, and
their occupation of the fort of Karabar
over the protest of tho Check com
mander. Incitement and some consternation
resulted ns this was tho first appear
ance of Italian and ifusslnn troops in

till the ullies had been involved.
The fort is locuted on tho peninnula

The reason for the landing was the
belief of tho allies that the Austro-Oer-mnn
submarines were obtaining supplies
from the peninsula. Moreover, tho al
lies wanted the place because of its
strategic value.
Officials expressed surprise nt the
