Following the storm of the City Hall yesterday by hosts of
Indignant taxpayers," and heated talk over the matter last night,
the story spread about Bridgeport like wildfire today that the
-pets of the administration, the powers behind them, smaller of
ficials and friends of the bdsses, were the only ones spared,, in
the wholesale raising of tax rates. ' ' , 1
, V A perusal of the tax books here and , there gave at least
partial foundation for this story. Companies and persons that
had incurred the hate of the administration suffered enormous
raises in valuations. , S ' , !

. Bridgeport's new almshouse, Hill
side Home, is virtually ready for oc
cupancy, but there isn't any furniture
"', in it ' v
' ' Because there was urgent need for
'a , new almshouse, the people1 of
Bridgeport agreed to build --one. The
j board of charities found that $175,000
would construct, the type of building
desired In this city. At a special
polling, the people voted ' to go into
debt to this extent to provide for pres
ent neeils.
Carelessness and extravagance with
the city's funds followed,. In the an
nual report of the charities depart
ment for, 1915 it was recorded that
there would be a deficit of $15,690.49
actual construction. s. - .
This was blamed on the industrial
depression that made it necessary for
the . city to put men to Work. No
-mention was made of the fact that
.It would have been necessary anyway,
to hire laborers and pay them stan
dard wages; The idle citizens were
obtained at low rates.
Besides this building deficit, there
is a lack of mondy to pay for "furni
ture, although the peoplex provided
for that in their bond Issue. The
K board asked $22,000 extra 'from the
board of apportionment last year and
the plea yas rejected. It is likely
the .administration will try to push
It through this year, 'however, by go
,ing over the board of apportionment's
head, through the advisory board, and
seeking a bond, issue. t
Besides ' this, $37,000 , extortion,
Bridgeport taxpayers have the knowl
edge that the Hillside Home is not
,what it was planned to e when the
$175,000 was sought. Mayor Wilson
' and his trusty henchmen made some
' of the better features "look sick," last
summer, in an effort to stave off a de
ficit that might be as high as the
bond issue.
The mayor suggested leaving off
covering- of the steel beams, in some
of the rooms. Cinders were su bsti -'

wanted to grab ' atonce and conse
quently the vexatious delays, coupled
with the fact that only one of theas
sessors had stayed to answer questions
of the property owners as to why their
assessments had been raised, did not
relieve the situation any.
At noon, it was " necessary , to lock

J ON HUILOM
CHIEF SMITH IS
VINDICATED IN
CONTEMPT CASE
Controversy Between New
Haven Officials Is Brought
' To Close. , '
CHIEF HAD TAKEN
ALL'' RESPONSIBILITY
Charges Made; By Liquor
Prosecutor Included 3
Other Officers.
New Haven, Jan. 29 Chief of Po
lice Philip Smith was declared not
to be in contempt of court' with crim
inal intent, this time at least, by
Judge Hall, in the city court today as
the result of a hearing conducted by
City Attorney Moyle,-Into the con
troversy between Chief Smith and
Liquor Prosecutor H. M. Dickerman,
which had arisen lover charges made
by the latter that the chief's orders
to members of his force operated to
delay service of search warrants.
, Three other officers were charged
by Mr. Dickerman with contempt of
court but Chief Smith assumed all re
sponsibility. Mr. Dickerman claim
ed that as he was an officer of, the
court a police officer was bound to
obey the order bf the court irrespec
tive of any order the chief might have
made as' to procedure to be followed
in serving warrants. The court up
held Mr. Dickerman that the liquor
prosecutor was an officer of the court
and ' a warrant issued ' by , the court
must be served by the' police officer
IU WJ1UIU 1 1- WW ftlV I.
, Recently, state policemen .were
brought here -by Dickerman to see if
the liquor laws are observed. It was
reported that 32 search warrants were
handed to officers who eajd they would
have to ask the chief for instructions.
Mr. Dickerman - took, up- the matter
with the . chief who . Is said to have
declared that warrants should be serv
ed through his offlce fotuyartous reasons,.-among
which, was that warrants
sometimes were, of . the "John v-Doe"
variety and wore . against-. places in
which more than. one family lives and
as , a protection to police officers in
case, of false arrests. '
Mr. Dickerman formally complain
ed to the. court and this led to an
inquiry by. City . Attorney Moyle and
the hearing. ; Mr. Moyle quoted from
the statutes itso show what was said
in them about search warrants. He
added that he felt satisfied that Chief
Snritb."had no intention' of disobeying'
he court's orders i but had ; believed
his orders .: to , subordinates " trjat all
business must be transacted through
iiis office were perfectly proper. Mr.
Moyle said he .believed the court could
overlook the matter- this time. ' Mr.
Moyle said that under the, statutes a
search warrant sworn to 'by the prose
cutor and two other "persons could be
handed . to a city policeman and it
must be served.- The warrant in the
first place must be given for adequate
cause. . . '
Mr. Moyle said that Chief Smith and
the other officers were perfectly frank
in the matter as they had come into
court to test the, matter. ?- '
Chief Smith made a statement say
ing he was responsible to the city for
the efficiency of his force." To obtain
the highest efficiency he had to have
the : co-operation of the men'' under
him. He had read the statutes to
mean that when a warrant was hand
ed to an officer it must be turned over
to a superior officer for instructions,
it oftentimes being better to, tave a
warrant ' served by one mari than
ahdther. The chief said that he had
no intention of obstructing the law.
The sergeants also complained of, ad
hered,, simply to his instructions gov
erning the department. '
. Judge Hall said he was satisfied that
there was no intent of contempt of
court and he would overlook the mat-
1 ter this time but he wished to point
out that -the liquor prosecutor is an,
officer of the 'court and the medium'
through which a warrants, in liquor
case irf issued. -'.' '

Completes Testimony After
Three Days Under Cross
Examination. Providence. Jan. 29 Mrs. Eliza
beth F. Mohr today on the witnesa
stand ended her personal defense of
the change 1 that she had hired three
negroes to murder her husband, Dr.
C. Franklin Mohr.
For the greater part of three court
days she faced friendly and' unfriend
ly attorneys who drew from her every
detail of her life with Dr. Mohr.
Many of these details -were given re
luctantly. She neveri wavered in her
declaration that she 1 had nothing to
do with the murder although she had
objected strenuously to her husband's
attentions to other women.
Testimony of Mrs. Mohr was re
garded by the defense as the most
important in the trial which stands
adjourned until Monday.
.A letter written by Dr. Mohr , in
March, 190Sjv was read to the jury
as follows: - '
"I am rather surprised to 'hear from
Elizalbeth. that you dolefully betrayed
a trust and I dare believe her added
falsehoods, " both v you and your wife,
that were, appalling., , However, I am
not in the mudslinging business but
you must not; , say too much about
Elizabeth or you will have to reckon
with me.- For myself as J saict, I
don't care what you think ttut don't
think it too loud. Elizabeth, I ilnd.
had a perfect right to suppose she was
married and I find now I am in error.
I got my idea fromvSthe Maloney case
in New York, Maloney who secretly
married Osborne and had no record
made of it. The Aourts- held that
that was not legal. However, they
used: assumed names. Religion mix
ed' .lis all up and made us do as we
did. We consulted an attorney this
morning andj find that the fact that
the certificate, was not recorded- did
not t invalidate the transaction. . I
write; this in df ense of a good woman
at present, . although what i' contend
ed she 'admits and that is our present
difference.".,....- " - -
'What did your husband mean
when lie wrote "I am not in the mud
slinging (business. ' " '"
- "I don't know." ;
"He, got more mud in his life than
he threw?" "No, sir. Not while he
lived with me." '
"What did your husband ' mean
when he wrote, I write in the defense
ofa good womanV at present? Did
hemeaV you were not a, good woman
before?" "No, sir. I was always a
goodNgirl and mother."
- She admitted that at the time the
letter was written she was not living
with het- husband but was with her
mother in -Taunton.
'And your quarrel with your hus
band was the result of your -admitting
improper-conduct?" "No sir."
"Did you say that you had mades a
man of him an cL that everyone knew
it?" "Yes, the doctor always said I
made a man of him "and he- told hun
dreds about it."
"And his life right up to the end
was the result of- your: handiwork?','
"I was- parted from him lor two years
before the end." X
Thus completed Mrs.. Mohr's testi
mony and she left the witness stand.
