WATER RISES CLOSE TO BRIDGE
OVER DAM'S SOUTH SPILLWAY
The above photograph gives a splendid idea of how high the water
was in the reservoir during the recent mcximum, when the flow was over
ten feet deep on the spillways. Indications were ist night that the heavv
additions to the reservoir would again send the water many feet deep
over the concrete walls that form the spillways.

Here is the first photograph to reach Phoenix of the recent high wa

the reader his first idea of what the i ataract looked like when it reached
its late maximum of .something over ten feet.
As compared with last year's overflow of two and a half to three feet,
the orcient spillway record is amazing: no words can describe the beau
ty of the twin waterfalls that raised the river below the dam and caused
the shut down of the power plants.

so far as could he ascertained there
was no immediate danger of any com

not reached there.
Reservoir Figures
The reservoir rose fi.4S feet from 6
o'clock o'clock Thursday morning until
0 o'clock last night. In the twenty
four hours ending yesterday morning
there was a gain of 51,5"4 acre feet.
The total elevation of the reservoir
at o'clock last night was 234.90 feet.
The wire tn the intake was washed
out last night and no figures could
be obtained as to how much water
was coming in. A motor boat was
sent to the intake dam last evening
to get figures there.
Ford Washed Out
Pollowing the flood last week, n ford
was put in shape connecting Phoenix
with ranches across the bridge. The
high water last night, washed this out
of exeistenoe. Some anxiety was felt
as to tne south abutments which suc
cessfully withstood the attacks of the
water before. It was stated last night
that the precautions taken at that time
when over 2000 bags of sand were
placed in the hole, were still in force
and there was no danger at that point.
Much Debris
The water is full of debris. The
crew on dutv last night was kept busy
most of the time hooking grappling
hooks onto trees and other floating ob
jects. As soon as a solid connection
was made, everyone in reach would be
pressed into service, and by the light
of lanterns. jnd at the earnest eaiol
lings of Bargman, the floater would
soon be pulled into the stream.
There was nothing spectacular about
the vigil last night. Last week, prac
tically all the work done was in the
sight of thousands-of interested sight
seers. There was not a visitor on
hand at any time during the whole
night. The rush of sightseers is ex
peeted today. As soon as it becomes
known that there is as much water in
the river as before, the other half of
Phoenix which failed to make the pil
grimage to the river will undoubtedly
be on hand this morning. Precautions
have been taken to keep all off the
brkige. The rope w hich did such good
service before has been strung up, and
no one will be allowed near the struc
ture. The crest of the water is expected
here in about 24 hours. At that time
the previous high water mark will
probably be exceeded. The fact that
the Verde is coming up, as well as the
Salt, gives rise to this conjecture. In
the prcvimrs flood, the Verde receded
as the Salt came up.

TO STOP INVASION
We Couldn't Hold Sea 30
Days; Pacific Coast Eas

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28. Why a
force of at least 1.025,000 men would
be needed to 'protect the "vital areas''
of the Cnited States against a strong
enemy was detailed to the senate
military committee today by Lieuten
ant Colonel W. G. Haan, a member
of the war department board, which
spent several years working out de
fense plans.
The board visited and studied mi
nutely every part of the coast line.
It reported in 1913, but its findings
have been held confidential by the
department.
To protect the various areas, from
Portland, Me., to Norfolk, Ya., Colonel
Haan added, the board had concluded
that a total of 3X0,000 mobile troops
would oe necessary, exclusive of the
coast artillery supports and hattprv
personnel.
The needs of the Pacific coast he
gave as three divisions in the Puget
Sound region; one at the mouth of
the Columbia river: three at San
Francisco and one at Los Angeles
and San Uiego. Six divisions should
be held in reserve, he said.
How large an army would these
plans involve?" asked Senator Cham
berlain.
"One million and twenty-five thou
md men to protect the critical
areas. Colonel Haan replied.
Ships could lie outside of Boston,
Colonel Haan said, in discussing har
bor defenses, and destroy the navy
yard, the state house the Pore river
works, and the business district with
out being in range of the American
guns. He recommended that eight
Pi-inch rifles for direct fire and 16
12-inch long range mortars be added
to the defense there, all with a range
of more than 3o,ft()0 yards, against
the maximum range of 18,000 yards of
the present guns.
House Corrfmittee
Conclusions of the general staff of
the army as to the country's require
ments for adequate defense were de
lineated by its members todav before
the house military committee which is
considering the administration's army
increase measures. They held that one
million men 500.000 regulars and 500,
000 rt serves would be needed along
the Atlantic coast and the gulf from
Penobscot, Maine, to Mobile, Ala.: that
it takes a year to train a soldier: that
arsenals and supply depots should be
situated well in from the coasts and
at least 200 miles away from Canada or
Mexico: that the Philippines were not
essential to defense; and that the dan
ger points from foreign expeditions
were the North Atlantic cities, San
Francisco and Puget Sound.
"The Pnited States should whip an
enemy at the water's edge," Major An
drew Moses told the committee. "If
a foreign power believes we can do so,
the chances of war are less. There
should he one million men prepared
as a defending force for protection of
the coast against invasion, prepared
against possible loss of control of the
sea. Great Britain's navy would so
outnumber us now that we would lose
control of the sea very soon. With a
combination of the navies of two pow-
irwui o iiiiit-ii against us w e W OU1U
not be able to hold the sea thirty
days."
Major .Moses and other general staff
officers favored universal training in
peace time and universal service in
war time.
"In event of war," said Captain C. 15.
Kilbourne, "it is not likely that there
would be any landing of troops simul
taneously with the outbreak of war.
If we had war with Kngland we would
have very little time: Germany, a long
er time: Fiance, whose navy is a" little
ahead of ours well, we'd have hopes
France's navy might never arrive. But
now and for some time Jo come the
regular army is the only dependable
military asset of this country."
Captain Kilbourne said that the gen
eral staff had been working out the
problem of defense from a foreign at
tack on coast fortifications from the
rear. The Pacific coast problem of
defense he said was less difficult than
that on the Atlantic for Oregon and
Washington probably would not be in
vaded because of lack of railroads. The
general staff disagreed as to Alaska
but said there was no fear of attack of
southern ports.
Major P. D. Lockridge explained that
the war college plans for increasing
the army meant a cost of one million
dollars a day when in operation anil
that an adequate force could not be
built up for less.
Captain Frank S. Cocheu held that
while retention of the Philippines was
not essential from a military stand
point, strong bases should be main
tained at Oahu and the Panama canal.
He said a careful study of the situa
tion had shown that Puget Sound, Cal-

Although considerable fighting has
taken place along the various war
fronts, there have been no notable
changes in the positions of any of the
combatants.
In the region of Xeuville St. Vaast
the French have attacked with ha.nd
grenades the positions taken from them
by the Germans. But according to
Berlin they were repulsed with heavy
losses, although a mine crater was
captured by the French. Paris says
two attacks by tlle Germans in a road
between Arras and Lens were put
down and that a German munitions
depot was blown up near Puisaleine by
the French artillery.
All along the line from Riga to Bu
kowina there have been artillery bom
bardments and occasional infantry at
tacks by th Russians and Germans
anil Austro-Hungarians. Petrogrnd re
ports a surprise attack near Buozacz,
Galici.i by the Russians in which a
l'irge party of Teutons was put to
flight after having suffered heavy
losr.es, and also the capture of three
mine craters by the Russians north of
Bovan.
The Rati ans have re-occupied on the
heights to the west of Gorizia ground
from which they had previously been
forced to retire in the face of an Aus
trian attack, and also have put down
with heavy casualties a strong attempt
by the Austrians to advance in the up
per Tsonzo region.

Charge German Officers
Tied to Trees That Ger
man Bullets Might Strike
Them; General French
Makes Statement
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
LONDON, Jan. 28., 11:05 p. m The
foreign office this evening made pub-
lie a note from the German foreign of-
fice transmitted through James W. Ger-
ard, the American ambassador to Ger
many, relating to alleged cruelty on
the part of French and English troops
toward German prisoners. The British
government gives unqualified denial to
the charges.
The note requests the Washington
government to transmit a protest
a;jainst "this violation of international
law," to both the British and French
governments. The instances of alleged
cruelty cited are:
First, during the battle at Guise
.Tongcux, August 30, 1914, a French
officer ordered a severely wounded
German officer to be placed on the
rampart of a French trench under the
fire of German artillery with the ob
ject of having him killed by German
bullets.
Second, on January 13, 1015, in the
neighborhood of Soissons, French
troops placed two captured German
soldiers on the rampart of their
trench, which was under German fire,
compelling them thus to pass many
agonizing hours.
Third, between March 13 and 17,
1915, British troops in front of their
trenches at Aubers tied a wounded
German officer to a tree and opened
lire on him when he waved his hand
kuciiiet to the Gernn lines, and re
pulsed, by firing, the German at
tempts to free him from his desperate
position.
"Evidence given at German military
inquiries into these incidents," says
the note, "have ifiven us proof of their
accuracy."
The British reply to the charges is
an unqualified denial from Field Mar
shal French, in command of the troops
at the time of the alleged cruelties,
which is supported by statements from
officers along the front where the
cruelties are alleged to have occurred.
In his denial. General French says:
"The reports siiow that nothing is
Known of the ill-treatment of German
prisoners. On the contrary there were
no trees in that locality to which a
German officer could have been tied
as alleged. The general officer com
manding the Indian corps specifically
reports that there was no maltreat
ment whatever, but that German
wounded were rescued with heroism
by Britishers.",
General French adds that the evi
dence is Conclusive that there were no
such occurrences as charged. The
supporting statement of General An
derson of the Indian troops cites a
number of instances where Indians
rescued Germans who had been aban
doned between the lines by their own
forces.
