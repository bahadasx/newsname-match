City Council Decides to Permit Moving
Pictures in Churches and Schools
Other Work of Aldermen.
The Battle for Delegates, Committeeships and Other
Big Plums Taking Up Attention of
Local Statesmen.
Wet and Dry Question Will Cut a Big Figure in Next
Year's Battle Throughout the State
of Illinois.
Factions in Both the Big Parties Are Making a Hard Fight for
the Control of the Managing Committees.
The exhibition of moving pictures
In churches and schools was legalized
by the City Council passing nn or
dinance to that effect on Monday
night, by a vote of 37 to 20.
Mayor Thompson vetoed a similar
ordinance several months ago on the
ground that labor leaders had not
bad sufficient opportunity to be heard.
The ordinance makes possible the
use of slow-burning Alms without the
presence of moving plcturo operators
licensed under present regulations.
Its advocates contended that the non
inflammable films wero safe, but op
ponents, Including many representa
tives of organized labor, refused to
concede It. The voto on tho passage
of the ordinance was 37 to 25.
"I would not bo afraid to have my
8-year-old boy use this film without
anybody else about," said Alderman
Pretzel, chairman of the building
committee, In advocating tho passago
of the ordinance. "It is impossible
to start a tiro with a slow-burning
film."
Alderman Vanderbllt said Chicago
should follow the example ot New
York, Los Angeles and Boston, which
already permit the uso of tho slow
burning Alms under conditions simi
lar to those specified in the ordinance.
Aldorman Dempsey led the fight of
the opposition.
"I am not satisfied that this ma
chine or film has reached the stage
where it is absolutely safe," he said.
"I will not take the responsibility of
imposing this danger upon the women
and children who attend school and
church entertainments."

Per Year.
The twenty judges of tho Circuit

Increase to their $10,000 salaries al
lowed by tho last legislature, and
they have started a fight before the
county board, which Is questioning
the legislature's authority In this
case,
"If tho Judges aro entitled to the
$2,000 salary Increuso by law, let
them go Into court and provo It," has
been tho policy of Potor Relnberg,
president ot tho county board, the
appropriating body, and ho reiterated
that policy yesterday.
Not a ono of tha Judges stopped

Cutting as counsel to defend tho
judges' salary rights.

comptroller, William J, Graham, had
submitted tho 191C budget estimates

Produced by separation from the

following jolt from Sullivan head
quarters, just Issued In an address to
the faithful:
"As many of the Thompson Demo
crats hold lucrative positions under
Mayor Thompson or enjoy favors re
ceived at his hands, It is reasonable
to suppose that they are doing -what
Is pleasing to him. Perhaps they will
even go so far as to insist that 'Big
Bill' should head the list of delegates
to the Democratic national conven
tion. Why not, when they propose
that the men who did the most to
make him Mayor should bo on that
delegation? . . . Had Benedict Arn
old at the close of the Revolutionary
War Insisted that ho should be made
a delegate to tho convention that
drew up tho Constitution of tho Unit
ed States, there might have been such
a precedent."

and St. Louis national conventions:
All stato committeemen.
All ward committeemen In Chi
cago. All precinct committeemen In tho
country towns ot Cook and In all
downstate counties.
The Democrats in the Twenty-third
ward will probably re-elect Joseph
U QUI, Sullivan candidate for com
mitteeman. Among the Republicans
In tho Twenty-third ward tho old
Pease organization threatens to bring
out as a candidate for ward commit
teeman Charles S. Dcneen's law as
sociate, former Judge Axel Chytraus,
against E. J. Drundage, tho present
committeeman. Mr. Chytraus ran Mr.
Drundage a hard race two years ago.
The city hall faction, headed by Mi
chael J. Fahorty, has In grooming
Henry E. llrandt, paint nnd varnish
manufacturer.
Such a three-cornered contest and
It's tho likely lineup would precipi
tate a great politicul mlxup. Two
years ago tho Pease faction was with
Judge Chytraus. Tho antl-Pense fac
tion was with Mr. Drundage.
Tho ward Is torn up over the battlo
for the Republican aldormanlc nomi
nation botweon Alderman John KJel
lander nnd Julius Reynolds Kline. The
Deneen-Pease people aro with tho
former; tho city hall with tho latter.
There is little chance of a third al
dermnnlc party.
In tho Twenty-first ward City
Comptroler Pike Is expected to carry
the city hall colors In the battlo
against Oscar Hobol, the present
committeeman. Ho Is tho strongest
man the city hnll faction can find.
Mr. Hebol's friends claim tho support,
of Fred W. Uphnm. Mr. Hobol Is a
"neutral."
Tho Deneuu people ore casting
about for a candidate They would
like to get Frank A. Vogler, formor
chlof clerk of tho Hoard of Rovlow.
Mr. Voglor Is n friend of Roy O. West,
also ot Mr. Uphnm. He fought Hebel
to a closo finish two years ago. Karl
Walker, a lawyor, Is tho only candl
ditto to dato against Aldurman Krauso
who carries no factional colors.
In tho Third ward tho position ot
City Treasurer Charles H. Sorgel Is a
mystery. Ho is tho present Progres
sive committeeman and should ho de
cides to run for Republican commit
toomnn thoro would bo a breaking up
ot somo present combinations, The
Doncen people are pledged to Robort
Levy for committeeman, against Wil
liam A. nithor, tho city hall leador.
Tho aldormanlc fight to dato lies
between Aldorman N. A. Stern, anti
city hall, and Fred W. Patterson, city
hall candidate Thero Is n possibil
ity of a third candidato In both aldor
manlc and committeeship lists.
