SCENE OF DEEP SNOWS
Early Days Are Recalled 1906-07
Snow Was Deep Two Feet Fell
on Christmas.
Bemulji is in the grip of a big
snow storm and already there is
more snow here than there has been
for the past ten years.
During tne pasi three days 15 in
ches of snow has fallen, and the
dtpth of snow is estimated at 25 in
ches Along the country roads and
in several of the Bemidji streets the
snow has drifted, making piles high
er than a man's head. Some of the
country roads are so badly blocked
with snow that traffic is practically
at a standstill.
Use Snow Plows.
The city engineering department
had two snow plows working since
early this morning making paths.
Tins afternoon the Crookston Lum
ber company placed its plow in op
eration It is believed that paths
ill be made to all points in the city
by late this afternoon.
All trains are late and the M. &
I and Great Northern today began
using a double header for passenger
trains
The big snow has temporally halt
ed work in the lumber camps.
Topic of Discussions.
The deep snow today was the topic
ot much discussion and many remini
censes
In the early days before 1896 it
was stated that the snow was so deep
that trees were cut half way up the
trunk instead of digging out the
snow to the ground.
"The winter of 1896 and 1897
was a winter of deep snow," said
A M. Bagley of the Bemidji Manu
facturing company. "I returned
from the east that winter with my
wife and when we got as far as
Crookston we had to wait a week
before a railroad train could be run
to Fosston, then the end of the rail
way When we did get started the
train was pulled by two locomotives,
had a snow plow and 125 men to
shovel snow. During that winter
practically everybody had to wear
snow shoes.
"Tho winter of 1906 and 1907
saw a good deal of snow, but not
as steady as this winter. I remem
ber that it snowed about two feet
on Christmas but after that it only
snowed in spells."
