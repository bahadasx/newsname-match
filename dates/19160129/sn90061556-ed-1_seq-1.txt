Who Is delivering a very able and comprehensive lecture on "Eugenics,"
-will speak at St. Stephen's Baptist Church at 3:30 Sunday, January 30.
Mrs. Rosa A. M. Mies of Birming
ham, Ala., spoke to a most appreciat
ive audience at our church Wednesday
evening, on "Eugenics," and wo were
all so well pleased with her address
that she was invited, to repeat the
same lecture on Sunday night, which
she did to a crowded bouse. Her
Thllosophy ia clear ' and convincing,
and her judgment sound. She handles
her subject with such discretion that
the entire audience went with her up
9n the mountain of scientific Eugen
ics and viewed the unborn babes of
the future generation, being born in
His image and in His likeness. Mrs.
Miles is brimful of good common
sense and has a burning message, that
is for the good of the nation, and I
sincerely wish that she could be heard
in every church and hall where our
people congregate, for I sincerely be
lieve she has the real key to th situa
tion. Yours for the uplift of humanity,

The memorial exercises in honor of
the lato Bishop Abram Grant under
the auspices of the Ministerial Alli
ance of Greater Kansas City, were

rendered as follows:
Selection Choir of Ebenezer Church.
Invocation Rev. Richard Davis, Cen
tennial M. E. Church.
Scripture Lesson 15th Chapter of
Corinthians Rev. T. A. Wilson.
Introductory Remarks Rev. Wm, H.
Thomas, Master of Ceremonies,
After which Dr. J. C. C, Owens de
livered an excellent address on "Bish
op Grant, the Prophet."
Rev. W. C. Williams spoke on "Bish
op Grant the Preacher," and it is need
less to say it was up to the usual high
standard of the eloquent Dr. Williams.
Editor N. C. Crows spoke on "Bish
op Grant as the Layman's Friend,"
and the Rev, Geo. McNeal, moderator
of the Kansas Baptist Association,
spoke; on "Bishop Grant the Citizen."
Judge I. F. Bradley delivered a very
comprehensive address on "Bishop
Grant a Race Leader."
Prof. J. R. E. Lee, principal of Lin
coln High School, delivered a highly
eulogistic address on "Bishop Grant
the Educator," while one of the most
graphic as well as pathetic addresses
of the day was delivered by Dr. J.
'Frank McDonald, who took the place
of ,Dr, J. R. Ransom'who was called
to Chicago, on "The Last Scenes of
the Life of Bishop Grant." The ad
dresses were interspersed with vocal
selections by a chorus from Western
University under the leadership of
Prof. R. G. Jackson, splendid selections
by Ebenezer Choir and a magnificently
rendered solo by Miss Lena Mosely, "I
Heard the Voice of Jesus Say." An
offering was taken for Douglass Hos
pital, of which Bishop Grant was the
founder, and a number of busts of ihe
Bishop were sold as well as quite a
few card likenesses distributed free

very Inclement weather kept the build
ing from being crowded to the doors
by those desirous of doing honor to
the memory ot one of the greatest men
the race has ever produced.

ALLEN CHAPEL NOTES.
Last Sunday was an ideal Sabbath.
An unusually large audience was out
to hear Dr. William H. Thomas for the
first time this year. Before entering
upon his sermon, Dr. Thomas very
forcefully warned his congregation of
the great danger of losing the revival
spirit. He said: "Generally after a
great and successful revival, such as
was held In Allen Chapel by Dr. How
ard, the peoplo were very apt to find
themselves possessed with a feeling of
satisfaction, which was to be guarded
against wit hthe greatest care, and
the revival spirit which the meeting
had engendered, should bp kept alive.
The revival was a tremendous success,
there being more than seventy souls
added to the church.
The Allen Chapel choir, which has
been augmented to almost a hundred
voices, is using Billy Sunday's "Great
Revival Hymns." The, hymns are Un
usually sweet and touching, and Prof.
Jackson and the choir know exactly
how to reach the hearts of men and
women. The following is Dr. Thom
as's text: "They that dwell In the
secret place of the Most High, shall
abide In the shadow of the Almighty."
This was taken fromthe first verse of
the nlnty-flrst Psalm.,
Allen Chapel Is loo'klng forward to
"Go-to-Church-Sunday." Dr. Thomas
Is urging his members to use every .ef
fort to have a congregation on that
day of fifteen hundred souls. There
will be three captains and fifteen hun
dred tags. Dr. Thomas suggests' that
we do not tag those whose habits pre
to come to church, but tag those who
do riot go to church.

him. Meat should be cut Into small
pieces, vegetables either mashed or
put through the colander, and all the
cores, skins and seeds should be re
moved from fruits.

He should not be allowed to drink

ed for children from two to three
years, and a dally program is sug
gested for the convenience of the
mothers :
7:30 a. m.: Cereal Well cooked
oat, wheat or corn preparation, with

gar. Cereals should be cooked three
hours in a double boiler and flavored
with a little salt when being cooked.
Glass of whole milk, warmed In the
cool months of the year. Egg, soft
boiled, poached or coddled. Toast, or
dry bread and butter.
10 a. m.: Fruit Use one orange
and strain the juice, or a baked ap
ple and two graham crackers; or
warm milk, one glass, with dry bread
or toast.
2 p. m.: Vegetable Soup One tea
cupful or meat broths with rice or
arrowroot.
Meat Beef, mutton or chicken,
broiled, roasted or boiled; or fish; cut

cabbage, onions, celery, radishes, pas
try, syrups or pelltes; nuts or can
dies; bananas, nor any green or over
ripe fruit; tea, coffee, wine, beer, ci
der or soda water. Mothers are apt
to err chiefly In the matter of sweets.
In fedlng children, An excess, of
sweet food not only upsets the youiic
stomach but destroys partially the ap
petite for plain food.
Children should be taught to eat
simple, well cooked food, but should
not be forced to eat when they have
on appetite. If a child shows a dis
inclination to eat some special food,
which he ought to have, this should
be given first at the meal, even If
only a small quantity is eaten. Do
hot fall Into the error of sqoldtng the
child at meal times, which should' be
one of the pleasantest hours of tho
day, full ot fun and joy. A little ju
dicious coaxing will'" usually result In
the child's taking the right food In
sufficient quantity,

tables and soups for young children
