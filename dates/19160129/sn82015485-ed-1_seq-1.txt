MAY CO TO CONGRESS
Otis Lu Benton, of Oberiin, who is
widely known over the state and has
been a familiar figure at sessions of
the Grand Lodge of the A. O. U. W
is a candidate for-the Republican
nomination for congress in the Sixth
district. Brother Benton, who has
held every office in Oberiin Lodge
No. 236 several times, was the repre
sentative of the lodge to the recent
session of the Grand Lodge at Hutch
inson. . He is an enthusiatic, hard
working member of the order. While
the Kansas Workman never dabbles
in politics, it can say that if Brother
Benton be nominated and elected the
people of the Sixth district will be
proud of their representative in con
gress Kansas Workman, December,
1915.

"if you read much you are sure to
discover new or strange words and oc
cassional ly you may hear a new one,
or a new pronunciation of an old and
familiar word.
Only recently, while reading a mag
azine, I made the acquaintance of a
word which had' such a strange ap
pearance I took the time and trouble
to "iook it up." The word is "cec
itv." v' - o .
I think I never saw "cecity" before
bift I may be mistaken. PerLaps my
sight "or my memory may be at
fault. The" word means "blindness."
. o
A word may be "new" in more than
onfe sense. Any word may be "new
oecause or recent coinage. Even an
old or obsolete may seem new because
oi recent coinage. ven an old or
obsolete word may seem - new when
current events suddenly bring it into
general nsuage again.
Inventions and discoveries are con
stantly making new words necessary.
These new words are often formed by
combining parts of old wards, but
not always. The word "aeronaut"
has long been used in connection with
ballooning, but when the flying tnach
me was invented a new word was
needed as a name for the operator.
Hence we have "aviator," and more
recently we have have "aviatrix," to
distinguish the female of the species.
, ' o
Any man who navigates the air
may be called an aeronaut, but a bal
loonist is not a birdman. The one
rises by virtue of the force of gravity
(paradoxical as that may seem; while
the other mounts into the air in spite
of it. Both the balloonist and the
birdman are airman but only the lat
er is an aviator; hence, the use of
distinguishing words, v Perhaps if
women take to ballooning we may
ifi LFfcee ti,e word "aeronaatrlx ,
or tress.
. ; ' O '
The war in Europe has brought in
to use a great many new or unusual
words, so many in fact, that one
needs the latest ' atlas, gazetteer and
dictionary constantly at hand in or
der to read the daily news intelligent
ly. Funk & Wagnalls last summer
sent out a little-, handbook of war
words which is worth having.
ANOTHER NORTH AND SOUTH ROAD
Plans for a new north and south
railroad in Kansas were outlined to
day when the state charter board
granted a charter to the Garden City,
Hastings & Omaha Railway company
The new company is chartered with
a capitalization of $100,000. Four
propositions outlined In the charter
call for the construction cf 313 miles
of standard gauge road in Kansas.
The new railroad project calls for
an extension of railroad facilities in
to a number of western counties.
Even the few remaining rail roadless
counties will be served under the
plan outlined for the new Toad. The
project calls fof a north and south
line from Smith county southwest to
the Oklahoma line in Morton county.
The line wttl enter Nebraska at the
north line of Smith county.
A total of thirteen counties are to
be served under the plan defined in
the charter agreement. The first
proposition calls for the construction
of 163 miles of road northeast from
Garden City through Finney, Hodge
man, Jfess, Trego, Ellis and Books
county to Stockton. A second plan
provides for an eighty mile line
southwest from Garden City through
Finney, Haskell, Grant, Seward,
Stevens and Morton counties to the
Oklahoma ' line. The third plan is
for the construction of fifty miles of
road northeast from Stockton through
Rooks, Phillips and Smith counties
to the Nebraska state line. The
fourth plan is for the building of 25
miles of road connecting with the
first road in Trego county and run
ning in an easterly direction through
Ellis county to Hays.
The proposed northern terminal of
the road is Omaha, according to the
charter plan. Promoters of the road
plan the construction of a north and
south line with gulf outlet for the
Kansas wheat counties.
A number of north and south roads
have been planned in Kansas. None
has been completed. Promoters of
the new road, however, declare that
they will begin within the year.-
Ineorporators of the new road are:
