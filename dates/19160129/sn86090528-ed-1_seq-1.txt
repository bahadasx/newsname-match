Mr. Venable pictured the father of the
murdered boy endangering his own
life in a fruitless effort to protect the
life of his son; he told of the firing
ot the fatal shot; of the sinking to
the floor of the gaspin? son, wouuded,
dying victim; of the funeral pall, the
tears and the desolated home and ask
ed at the hands of the jurors a punish
ment for the man who did the kill
ing. Mr. Venable was followed by Uany
Hammerly for the defense. In a short
speech Mr. Hammerly reviewed the
t stlmony and told the Jury how the
killing could have been must have
teen a purely accidental one. The
court recessed for the noon hour fol
lowing Mr. Hammerly's close.
With tho reconvening of the court
Judge F. E. Riddle, for the defence, ad
dressed the jury. For three hours
Judge Riddle, In a fervid speech, car
ried his auditors with him into the
musty confirms ot the little barber
shop; he showed) them the gathering
of the nina young men in the shop; he
told of the "seance," lasting from 7:30
in the evening until after midnight,
wherein nine youths diank whisky and
rung songs until the night reverber
ated with their shouts; he told ot the
first trouble the. playful manner in
which the defendant scuffled with his
final scenes when the pistol in the
hands of the accused' was alleged to
have exploded accidentally, 1U bullet
finding its mark in the breast of the
friend whom tho defendant loved as
a brother. In closing Judge Riddle pic
tured tho disgrace which would rest
upon and brood, like some bird of evil,
over the lives of the defendant's fami
ly, his aging mother, his aging
.father, his lcvlng wife and his Inno
cent children, In event the verdict ot
!the Jury should unjustly confine the
prisoner to a leon's cell. In graphic
word pictures Judge Riddle described
death in tha electric chair and appeal
ed to the jurors not to sentence tho
prisoner to such a fate unless satisfied
beyond a reasonable doubt of his
guilt, of his intentional, malicious, cold
blooded and premeditated guilt.
Following Judge Riddle, Alger Mel
ton made the closing argument for the
fitate. In beginning his address to the
jury Mr. Melton stated that he was a
"hired prosecutor;" that he had been
employed to assist in the prosecution
of this case, and said that he had no
apologies to make to any one. Then
Mr. Melton got down to brass tacks
and from 4 o'clock until after 6 he
swayed the jurors, the witnesses, the
I court attaches, the gathered audience
ot morbidly curious who filled the
court room. The speaker reviewed the
events of the fatal eevning Immediate
ly preceding the early morning 'hour
when Marvin Chitwood lost his life;
he told of the drinking and the carous
ing In the barber shop; of the drink
crazed brain which led the prisoner
at the bar to thirst fir the heart's
blood of the innocent boy; he told
of the heart-broken father and mother
whose boy had been rushed from their
fireside Into the presence of his
Maker; ho told of the struggles of the
gray-haired father with the drink-
crazed and drink-frenzied assassin In
his efforts to stay the hand which fired
the fatal shot; ho told of the pall
which had fallen over the happy home
and stated that the loving mother, the
kind old father, the majesty of the
law, demanded that the prisoner at the
bar expiate tho crime he had com
mitted; he said the sleeping boy, rest
ing beneath the sod of eternity was
crying to the jury, not for vengepnee,
but that Justice might be nietert to
his murderer.

COLLEGE STUDENTS
SUCCESS IN
Probably the most pretentious drama
matic production ever presented at the
Oklahoma College for Women was
staged Friday evening in, the presence
of a large audience when the students
or the department or expression, utiuei
the direction of Miss Frances Dins
more Davis, head of the department,
appeared in -'The Piper."
The play is a heavy one and itt
pleasing production even on a com
pletely equipped stage by professional
actors would be difficult. All 'the cir
cumstances considered, it will be con
ceded that the college students achiev
ed a decree of success possible only
as the result of the most skilled train
ing. The fact that the cast calls for
many male characters made the under
taking of the girls all the more diffi
cult and their achievement the more
creditalile to their talent and the abil
ity of their director.
Failure of certain costumes to ar
rive was a slight handicap but, on the
whole, the costumes and stage set
tings, with the new scenery recently
installed. Droved very effective. The
play itself needs no praise, having al
ready been pronounced a masterpiece
of dramatic writing by competent
critics in England, the author, Jose
phine Preston Peabody, having been
awarded a grand prize and further
honored bv having her 'play presented
by the famous Benson players at the
Shakespeare Memoral theater, Strat-ford-on-Avon.
It speaks well indeed,
for Miss Davis and her pupils that
such a piece of work should ue at
tempted. To Miss Mary Thompson, who played
the part of the "Piper," must be ac
corded special praise, the more in view
of the fact that her only training in
exnression has been received in the
college here since the opening rt
school in September. Others who car

Duke of Genoa Gets "Sit In" During Ab

With People
GOES IN STRONG FOR
DEMOCRATIC WAYS
Declines to Accept Usual Perquisites of

Clothes with Single Attendant;
Rushes to Rescue Woman
By HENRY WOOD.
(United, Press Staff Correspondent.)
ROME, Jan. 20. (By Mall.) The
Duke of Genoa, who "subs" as kin at
the Quirinial while Victor Emmanuel ia
at the front, is fast proving himself a
formidable rival of the latter for the
affections of the Italian petople. King
Victor, however, seems in no way dis
turbed. Eight months ago he asked
his august uncle to come down to
Rome and "sit In" for him. Until his
return from the Italian front this week
the king had not even returned to
Rome to see how his "sub" was get-
ling away with the job. There is per
haps no other royal family in Europe
whose members would do such a thing.
The House of Savoy now includes, be
sides King Victor and the Duke of
Genoa, the Duke o the Abruzzi, the
Duke of Aosta and the Count of Turin.
The five are cronies. Each has had
Ihe rigid military or naval training re
guired of every male' member of the
house and each is considered com
petent to be king. Victor would Just
as soon trust one as the other. He
chose the Duke of Genoa because he
was the eldest. He figured the younger
ones could better serve Italy in their
respective positions as military and
naval commanders. The choice met
with disapproval only from the Duke
himself.
"I know I am get Ling old," he said
wistfully to the court functionaries
who welcomed him to the throne, "but
my hand! would rather have grasped
the sword than the pen that must sign
royal decrees."
JCiug Victor has ever been known as
the most democratic sovereign in
i Europe, althau'gh perhaps the title ot
Soldier King would better suit him.
his "sub" has gone Mm one better
for democracy and won for himself
the sobriquet of the Civilian King.
The nearest the Duke of Genoa
conies to acepting any of the kingly
perquisites that go with the job, is at.
4 each day when he goes for his drive
n the country. Four cavalrymen sur
round his carriage and a corps of bi
cycle guards follow. The police won't
let him drive unless he accepts this
escort.
In the evening he makes up for it by
walking about the streets of Rome in
civilian clothes, accompanied only by
his chief aid-de-camp. He traverses the
principal streets and widow shops as
he goes along.
It was while amusing himself this
way one evening that the duke saw a
street car collide with a fat woman.
Ot all the men who leaped to her as
sistance, the duke got there first She
was quite uninjured but the duke bun
dled her off to a hospital before she
knew who had helped her:
Half an hour later when, the duke re
turned to the Quirinal he sent his aide
to the hospital to make certain sho
really was not injured.
When the duke comet! dovn to Rome
lo "sit in" tor his nephew as king he
does not bring his family with him. His
nearest relative here is his sister,
Queen Mother Margherita and he
never tires of visiting her hospitals
and charity works with her.
The duke comes nearest to being
king on Thursdays and Sundays, when
the ministers bring ; the various de
crees to him for his vicarious royal
signature. It is then that he gets first
hand information from the prime min
ister, the minister of war and the min
ister of marine on the conduct of hos
tilitie i. The minister of marine, es
pecially never fails to bring him some
news about his son, the Prince of
Udine. who is commanding ft squadron
of submarines.
The duke's new job brought back to
