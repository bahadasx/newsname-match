Meets Stone
Whose Heart
Is Harder Yet
By Ted Cook
The only way to get Into the
university is to make a forced
•entrance, I take It.
The red tape entanglements
are up.
And the gentleman whom the
undergraduates call "Zlt" Stone
Is armed with a machine gun
that shoots technicalities. He Is
the recorder.
"Zlt," it Kcenis. was the title
chosen because of the pointed
black beard that fringes the lips
of this tall, angular, nervous gen
tleman.
* lie keeps himself caged on the
second floor of the Administra
tion building, near the campus
entrance. •
"See Edward N. Stone If you
want to go to the university,"
said Frank Kane, the journalism
professor. "'They've made fast
the castle gates and he holds
the keys. You may have to talk
fast to get in. His name is
'Stone,' but his heart is harder
than that."
Now, the recorder may chalk
his cue just like any one else
when at the Faculty club. 'Tls
said be chews the end of a cigar,
and that lie runs after fire en
gines in a most human way.
i But he's a different man when
he pin es In his cage.
His eyes bore like gimlets.
When the freshman, '"Charley
Chaplins" Into his ofice, the re
corder turns big gimlets onto the
unfortunate youth. The air Imme
diately gets stuffy and Hie fresh
man's head gyrates.
Stone saw me enter his office*
He looked over his glasses -and
began to breathe hard.
".May I have a university cata
logue?" 1 asked.
"You may not," answered the
'recorder.
"Why not?"
"Because they aren't for gen
eral distribution. '
"What are they for, sir?"
"Libraries and schools."
Not being a library or a school
It was hsrd lo go ahead.
"May I have one for The
Times office?"
r. —"You may."
That was encouraging.

In hand, was to read 51-1 pages

COOPERATION
PAYS OFF THE
MORTGAGES
Jack Jungnieycr, of The Times staff, lias been
studying the remarkable record of the Puyallup iV:
iSiunner Fruit Growers' association.
He has found that it is recognized as the most sue
eessfnl co-operative enterprise in the United .Mates. !
His Investigation has resulted in a series ol arti- j
cles, with pictures, which tell a veritable IN PUS- i
TRIAL ROMANCE.
Part of this story is familiar to Southwest Wash
ington readers; much of it they have failed to
glimpse, eveji with it happening under their very I
noses.
So pleased were we with Mr. Jungmeyer's ar
ticles that we at once arranged for their distribu
tion through the Newspaper Enterprise Asso
ciation, of which The Times is the only South
west Washington member, and as a consequence
they will appear, not only in our paper, but in
more than 80 of the large dailies in cities like
Chicago, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Los Angeles and
St. Louis, and in a large number of smaller
papers.
This is one phase of Tacoma and Southwest Wash
ington promotion work of which The Times does a
great deal.
We need not point out what this bringing of the
resources of the valley to the attention of several
million readers will mean; the benefits are too ob
vious to* require remark.
There will be at least four of Mr. .Tungineyer's ar
ticles, maybe more. Be sure to read the first one to
day, and the others throughout the week.

With raspberries for ammuni

The revolt was against the

But to get into the university
—that looked Impossible.
"Bell boy!" I called to a lad
In a form-fitting blue-gray uni
form, "do you know anything in
this brown book that will get me
by the recorder's office and into

The lad's brow knitted and he
stiffened. He did a right face
movement to face me.
A Slight Mistake.
"I'm no bell boy," he snapped.
"I'm Private Foran, Co. D of the
University Cadet corps.
One cannot always tell when
he Is addressing one of the edu
cated!
"I beg your pardon, Private
Foran."
He grinned, then, and said

"See rule 35," was the sug
gestion from tin' cadet, "it tells
.low to be an auditor.
And it did.
"An auditor," said rule 35,
page 22, "Is one who Is a member
of the university or .in outsider
wbo wishes to attend a given
course or courses as a listener
without taking part ln the work
of the course or receiving credit
therefor."
Now for an "Advisor."

was the advice that a regular tax

So I'm looking for a "faculty

PERLIN, Jan. 31.—An effec
tive blockade against Germany
is impossible, Admiral Yon Holt
zendorff, chief of the admiralty
staff, declared in a statement to
day.
"England could not stop com
merce ln the Baltic between Swe
den, Denmark and Germany," he
said. He declared British sub
marines have been unsuccessful
ln the Baltic, and hinted strong
ly that Germany Is prepared for
Hny English action.
Hays It's a Bluff.
"Germany looks fearlessly and,
earnestly upon the plans which
would cause suffering to women
and children. But because the
blockade is impossible, 1 say it
Is a bluff.
"Anyone knowing the Baltic
situation will say that commerce
between Sweden and Germany Is
absolutely normal. For four
weeks no English submarines
have had success ln the Baltic.
We intend to make it more im
possible that they shall have.
"England already hampers
German trade. if a blockade
were declared now, she would
violate International law. She
would blockade not only Germany
but the neutral nations about
her.
Prepared for Emergencies.
"England proposes to make
hardships for our families, think
ing this will affect the men ln
the trenches. It will, for they
will fight harder.
"England's purpose ln this war
is to cripple Germany and de
stroy her commerce. After 18
months she is unsuccessful. An
effective blockade will have ab
solutely no effect on military de
termination, for we are prepared
for any emergency. We have all
drugs necessary ror war for sev
eral years.
When asked how long the war
will last, he said:
"Until we are victorious. It
will last until tbe allies learn
they cannot accomplish their
purpose by defeating Germany.
It will last a long time.
"England does not fear the
German navy, but does fear
America and tbe growing Amer
ican navy."
Yon HolUendorff declared
that not more than 25 German
submarines have been lost. He
said some submarines have gone
through the English nets with
out damage.
