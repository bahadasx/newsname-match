Berlin. Jan. 31. An effective block
ade of Germany is impossible. Admiral
Von Holtzendorff. chief of the Ger
man admiralty staff, declared today in
an exclusive statement to the United
Press.
Kngland, he said, could under no
circumstances stop commerce in the
Baltic between Sweden and Denmark
and Germat.y. For wcka. he pointed
out, no British submarine has had
anv success in the Baltic. The Rus
sian fleet is frozen in Russian harbors.
The only effect of a declaration of
blockade by the allies, the chief if
the admiralty said, would be upon
neutrals and upon the women and
children of Germany. He hinted
strongly that Germany is prepared for
any action by Great Britain.

Dublin, Jan. 31. Official fig
ures of Irish emigration for 1915
are the lowest on record. Exclud
ing the 3.000 emigrants to Great
Britain, most of whom went there
for work in the munitions factories,
the total number of emigrants
from Ireland to all parts of the
world was just ver 8.000. The
yearly average for the last 16 ;
years was more than 34.000. The
change is due in part to the war,
also partly to the gradual amelior
ation of conditions in Ireland,
owing to remedial legislation.

Mrs. Wilson occupied a box near

orchids.
"I want at the outset to remove
any misapprehensions in your
minds," said the president. "There
is no crisis; nothing new has hap

you on a matter which we should
confer on in any event. We
should see that our house Is set

The crowd applauded.
Tlie very uncalculated course

the midst of these difficulties I

knew the people wanted him to

was prolonged applause.

solemnly, "thut, God helping, I
will keep it out of war."
Milwaukee, Jan. 81. President Wil
son threw down the gauntlet today to
opponents of national preparedness
who have declared that the movement
sprang from the desire of munition and
armament manufacturers to make
money.
"There are some things that are be
ing said, that I hope you will not be
lieve," the president declared.
"It is being said among other things
that this agitation for preparedness
for national defense comes chiefly
from those who are interested in sup
plying the government with the muni
tions of war and from those who are
interested in supplying it with arma
ment. "Gentlemen, do not allow yourselves
to be misled by statements of that sort.
Anything that the government does
somebody is going to make money out
of it; but the impulse for this thing
does not come from those quarters.

mission of License Fee. "
The Sells-Floto circus wants to start
its season :"n Topeka this spring and
wants to bring the performers to
gether here but the city commission
could ee-? no excuse in that for per
mitting the circus people to show
without the payment of the usual five
dollars per ear as a city license. A
representative of the circus company
visited each member of the commis
sion this morning and the matter was
brought up before the commission at
its meeting. But there was nothing
doing. Tne commission refused to vio
late one of its own ordinances.
The representative stat.-d that the
show people would be in Topeka for
five or six days five hundred of them
getting ready for the reason. He
! pointed out that it would mean busi
ness for Topeka hotels and restaur
ants and for dealers in stock feed.
The ccmnvssion saw that point but
Commissioner V. G. Tardy also
pointed out tht while tte circus
would benefit a few it would also take
a lot of cajih out of town.
The present plan is to give the first
show of the season in Topeka April
16. Previous to that there will be
nearly a week during which perform
ers will be brought together and put
through their various stunts. The
city ordinance provides for th pay
ment of a license of five dollars per
car and at this rate the license for
the Sells-Floto show will be $130.
"If the Sells-Floto people want to
open in Topeka they will find a way
to do so," said Mayor House, "they

New York, Jan. 31. An ounce of
hair is worth a fortune. At least, that
is what Adele Blood thinks. She has
the most expensive tresses in the
world. Recently she had her hair in

She was led to do this through a
very curious accident which almost
resulted in the loss of her "crowning
glory," to say nothing of her life or
beauty. To understand the theory,
it is necessary to know that her hair
reaches almost to her knees and that

Charleston. S. C, Jan. 31. Naval
vessels continued to search the Caro
lina coast early today for the United
States submarine K-5, reported miss
ing since 1 o'clock Sunday morning
but according to information available
here their efforts had been futile. The
submersible had not responded to
wireless calls sent out from shore sta
tions and naval vessels and this led
marine men to express fears that the
boat had suffered at least an accident
to her wireless apparatus. A heavy fog
hung over the coast between here and
Cape Romain, 40 miles north of here,
where the K-5 was last sighted and
this made more difficult the task of
the searchers.

WOMEN AFTER HIM
Topeka Suffragettes Still Demanding
Interview With Wilson.
Topeka club women heading state
organizations seem detern ined to
gain an interview with President Wil-
; son, on the suffrage question, and
thus inject partisan politics into a
non-political visit. They accomplished
1 their avowed purpose of merely im
; pressing upon the president that worn
i an's suffrage is still on the map when
; they dispatched a telegram a few
days ago to Washington asking for
interviews.
ln reply Secretary Tumulty wired a
polite telegram to Mrs. Cilia lay
Monroe saying the briefness of the
president's visit would make such an
interview impossible
Then, Sunday Mrs. Monroe received
a telegram from the vice president of
tho Congressional Union at Washing
ton, T-. C, urging them to insist upon
a series of interviews with the presi
dent. The telegram acted like a
tonic on the women and Mrs. Monroe
and Miss Mabel Vernon met to make
arrangement? for a second attempt to
gain a hearing with the president. The
telegram received from Miss Lucy
Burns, vice chairmm of the Unioa,
follows:
"President stated in Washington
that he could not make appointments
with deputations It was possible,
however, that he might be approached
by dtputati ns which he would he abl

wearing her hair in a flowing manner.
During the action of the play one of
the scenes is at a crematory. In this
scene she is required to turn her back
to the furnace. The draught drew a
strand of her tresses into the glowing
opening. Had it not been for the
quick wit of Harrington Morse, one of
the supers in the play, it is horrible
to contemplate the fate of Miss Blood.

Allegations made against Arthur J.

wherein Kline charges that Bolinger
alienated his wife's affections, were
put under the glass by tho Topeka

Clad Hamilton, chairman of the asso

today at Captain Hamilton's offices in
the New England building After be

committee that no action had been
taken.
Invite Iiolinger to Appear.
It was stated that another meeting
will be held as soon as possible
probably the first part of next week.
At the next meeting Mr. Bolinger will
be invited to appear and tell his side,
of the case. Attorneys who were at
the meeting today were: I. I. Mote,
Captain Hamilton, A. A. Godard and
J. L. Hunt.
The sensational charges against Bol

answer to a suit for divorce
brought by Mrs. Kline several
days ago through Bolinger as attor

a divorce. He did ask that Bolinger's
alleged actions be probed by the court
and that the supreme court be me

Colonel Speaks on Promise and
Performance of Duty.
Calls Present U. S. Foreign
Policy MiIk and Water."
New York, Jan. 31. Theodore
Roosevelt spoke upon "Promise and
Performance in International Hutv" at
! the Academy of Music, Brooklyn, Sun
day.
Throughout Colonel Roosevelt had
the full sympathy of his 3,000 hearers.
Half of those present were women
and they seemed as enthusiastic am
the men. They stopped him with ap
plause when he said:
"A policy of milk and water on our
part encourages nations in a policy of
blood and iron."
When the handclapping ceased he
added: "We have been of no use to the Bel
gians, the Armenians, the Mexicans or
anybody else. The government policy
has been 'safety first.' It is the motto
of the men who jump into the life
boats ahead of the women and chil
dren.' Watchful Waiting.
Referring to "watchful waiting" In
j Mexico, Roosevelt read a report of the
post moriem examination on tne twen
ty Americans killed within a fortnight.
The document had reached him after
the speech was written.
Again Roosevelt departed from hie
manuscript to say what he explained
was a "word on the personal side." He
said:
"They jay I want war. But there
is no one here who wants war less. We
h ave f o u r boys a nd they would go.
The girls, too, would do their part here
at home. Perhaps I would go " The
crowd laughed as some one shouted,
"Why, sure."
"For this we dreaj war. But I say
to you now that I'd rather they would
go and were in their graves than flinch
in doing their duty at the nation's
call.'
