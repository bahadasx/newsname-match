ZEPPEIN;24im

FRENCH CAPITAL IN DARKNESS LAST NIGHT
Firemen Dashed Through the Streets Giving Warning of
Another Zeppelin Raid Thirty French Aeroplanes
Searched the Air for the Zeppelin A Dozen Bombs,
' Weighing About 600 Pounds Apiece, Were Dropped
The Majority of the Victims Were Killed in Their Beds.
Paris, Jan. 30. Twenty-four persons
were killed and twenty-seven injured
in the Zeppelin "raid over Saturday
night according to a statement today.
Ten of the wounded were placed in
hospitals owing to severity of their
hurts. .
Chased by French Aeroplanes.
Thirty French aeroplanes searched
the remote air regions above Paris
late tonight for a Zeppelin raider of
whose appearance warning . had been
given. By the time it had reached
the edge of the old quarters of the
city several of the airmen were able to
make out its pale yellow shape 14,000
feet from the earth. Frightened,
doubtless, by the numerous war planes
rising towards it, the Zeppelin wheel
ed and drove at full speed northward,
dropping in its wake in the darkness a
cargo of 3 1-2 tons of bombs. Then
continuing its flight at a great altitude,
the airship vanished
Had Been Warned.
The Parisians had been warned a
half an hour before firing and brought
the streets trumpeting the call known
as Stand to arms of the Cpresence of
the raider. The electric lights went
out and policemen cautioned careless
householders to close their shutters
and darken their windows and imme
diately. It was still early in the night,
close to ten o'cock and. many persons
were in the streets, the cafes were
open and the moving picture theatres
and playhouses still entertainipg their
audience. Then, in all parts of- the
city -could be heard tii whirr of num
erous aeroplane propellers, ; while ev
erywhere people went upon the bal
conies to watch for Zeppelins.
Series of Detonations.
Few Parisians appeared to believe
the raiders were likely to come, as
they had been turned back many times
previously. But suddenly in the
northeast of Paris there was a great
flare in the sky as the Zeppelin drop
ped an illuminant so that those in the
airship might see whether they were
over the city. Thena bomb fell into
9 street, crashing through into the
Subway and tearing a hole 15 feet in
diameter, but injuring no one. Quick-
curred, sounding dully throughout the
city.
House Cut In Two
One of the missiles fell upon an
Isolated house, occupied by a single
family. The building was bisected, one
end being demolished and its occu
pants hurled far out into an open lot
and killed. The other end of the house
was cut off sharply and a bedroom on
the second floor was left intact with
its occupants uninjured. The floor
was carried away under the head of
the bed. leaving the bed balanced on
the Jagged edge of the ruins with a
nine year old boy in it unharmed.
Zeppelin Going at Top Spted.
The Zeppelin must have been going
at top speed in that neighborhood for
the nearest trace of it beyond was a
quarter of a mile away where a bomb
fell in the center of a thicvk stone
wall and cutting a Dig hole out of it
as cleanly as if it had been done by a
knife dug through the pavement deep
into the earth, causing a bad cave-in.
Victims Burned in Debris.
In a more populous qaurter a bomb
struck a six-story apartment building
occupied by the families of working
men, cutting it in two from garret to
cellar, burying ten ' victims under the
debris of the central part of the struc
ture. The street front was untouched
and on. the other side ow the
gap six' kitchens of the V build
ing, one ato p the other, were left
open to the weather with the ranges
and utensils in plan view and ap
parently undisturbed. This quarter,
was besieged all the morning by dense
crowds which held at the street corner
by the police none but the city au
thorities of the government and news
paper men with identification cards
being allowed to inspect the ruins.
Bomb Weighed Nearly 600 Pounds.
The greatest throng was in the
street where men from the municipal
chemical laboratory were carefully ex
amining a bomb weighing nearly 600
pounds that had fallen in the court
yard of a factory and failed to explode.
The crowd at one time broke through
the police line and elbowed up to the
footboard of the official motor car to
gei a near view oi tne monster.
Killed In Their Beds.
Altogether a dozen bombs weighing
about 600 pounds each, were dropped.
'None of the fatalities occurred in the
open streets, the majority of the vie
tims being killed in their beds.
A fog of considerable, density hung
over -ans at tne time or the raid.
President Poincare, who in company
with the military governor of Paris
and the prefect of police, visited the
. scene of wreckage caused by somt' of
the bombs shortly after midnight
seemed greatly moved by "what he
saw. One of the houses that he view
ed was that of. Police Sergeant Bi-
dault, who had just reached his home
and who was killed by a bomb which
at the same time seriously injured his
sister-in-law.

DAM BURST IN
OTAY VALLEY, CAL.
Men from the Battleship Oregon Call
ed to Suppress -Looting.
San Diego, Calif., Jan. 80. Looting,
described by Rear Admiral Fullam,
commanding the Pacific reserve fleet.
"the worst I have ever seen." broke
out today on the Otay Valley, flood-
swept by the breaking or the otay
dam last " Friday. The lower valley
was turned into an armed camp, pa
trolled by marines and sailors from
the battleship Oregon and the cruisers
Milwaukee and South Dakota In San
Diego bay with orders to shoot looters
on sight.
The loss of life in the otay valley
now is estimated at 50, while reports
that the cloudburst in San Luis Rey
and San Pasqual valleys cost no more
than ten lives brought the probable
death list in this section to sixty.
A new flood poured down the Tia
Juana river today which has risen four
feet at its mouth at the foot of San
Diego bay.
A telepnone message from Tecate
said it was reported there that the
Morena dam, 60 miles back In the hills
had burst. Officials here, fearing that
fifteen billion gallons of water im
pounded by the dam would tear a new
channel for the river across Coronado
Strand into the sea, ordered residents
of Imperial Beach, a hamlet on the
strand, to fleet.
First news of the reported collapse
of the Morena dam came through E.
Ervast. city engineer of San Diego.
Ervast, trying to reach the Mexican
town of Tijana, met a Japanese run
nlng along the bank of the Tiajuana
river.
"Get back," cried the Japanese in
broken English. "Tell people lots wa
ter coming.
Ervast could see a four foot wave
coming down the river. He turned
his automobile and spread the warn
ing. George Cromwell, city engineer
of San Diego, and others, said that
nothing but the breaking of the Mor
ena dam could have caused the flood,
The dam stood 265 feet high in a
narrow gauge and was built of ma
sonry and reinforced concrete.
The water supply was taken from
the reservoir formed by the dam by
a tunnel into the creek, which fed the
lower. Otay dam. but the natural chan
nel for the water led into the Tia
juana river..- -
Of the 29 bodies recovered In the
Otaya valley only six have been lden
tifled.
' Federal troops patrolled the Coro
nado Strand along Sandspit offering
the only means of ingress into the
Otaya valley and turned back would-
be sightseers. The marines under
Capt. Charles T. Westcott, Jr., camped
In the valley while the sailors under
Ensign Hamilton O Brien of the Mil
waukee made headquarters In the lit
tle brick schoolhouse at Otay City.
Each man carried twenty rounds of
ammunition.
The United States destroyer Law
rence as base ship and a hospital squad
rrom the Milwaukee operated in con
junction with both forces.
Fifty farmhouses, according to per
sons acquainted with the Otaya vallev
must have stood In the path of the
flood. It was estimated that from four
to five persons occupied each, although
housing Orientals held a large number.
Many of these are believed to have
had timo to escape, although It is im
possible to check in any way against
the known residents of the valley. The
estimate of 50 dead is considered con
servative.
Reports that the town of Tialu ana-
Lower California, had suffered heavy
damage seemed to be confirmed today.
It was said that little was left of the
new racetrack plant which cost $200,-

Representative Saunders declared
the preparedness argument of "our
terrible ex-presldentf' had been, refut

Associated Press correspondent saw for
a few moments in the midst of a busy
day. says he was impressed with Col

charm and his friendly feeling for Ger

menting on the results of the visit on
the ground that the colonel was on a
confidential mission from the president.
iieUiia4iutioi(wag. the lraper
chancellor. It was learned, also enjoy
ed and appreciated the visit and ' re
gretted ; that the' colonel's brief stay
did not afford him an opportunity to
accept the invitations of personal hos
pitality which the chancellor and' the
foreign secretary had hoped to extend.
The final Interview of Colonel House,
who received among others today Dep
uty Heckscher, a director of the Ham
burg-American steamship, line, was
held with Dr. Alfred Zimmerman, the
under-secretary of foreign affairs, who

COLONEL HOUSE PLEASED
WITH VISIT TO BERLIN.
Will Do Much to Clarify German-
American Relations,
Berlin, via London, Jan. 30, 9.44 p,
m. Colonel Edward M. House, presi
dent Wilson's personal representative
has left Berlin for Paris and London
by way of Switzerland. Prior to his
departure, though declining to be
quoted with any particularity on the
results of his mission. Colonel House
said he was very glad he had come to
Berlin and added that the conversa
tions which he had had with leading
German statesmen and prominent men
in private life and particularly his
conferences with Ambassador Gerard.
had been most profitable and would
undoubtedly lead to a clarification or
German-American relations, although
it was to be- doubted whether any
definite tangible developments could
be expected therefrom.
His visit, which was chiefly for In
formative purposes, can scarcely be
said to have brought him any novel
or unexpected light on the -. German
situation, the main outlines of which.
It appears, are well understood . in
Washington, thanks to the copious re
ports received there from the Ameri
can ambassador; but he has been en
lightened with respect to various as
pects having particular interest for
President A'ilson.
Colonel House will, therefore, it is
believed, convey to the president
nothing startling new upon the Ger
man situation and the attitude of the
government ,in its various branches,
but a mass of detailed information
worked into shape In his long discus
slons with Mr. Gerard.

ADMINISTRATION SHIP
BILL IS REVISED
S-as-to Get the- Votes -of . Dissenting
' Demoorats,
Washington. Jan, 30. Details of the
new administration ship bill to build a
merchant marine and naval auxiliaries.
revised to command the votes of dis
senting democrats, were made public
tonight for the first time, it will do
introduced tomorrow in the house by
Chairman Alexander of the merchant
marine committee, who will lead the
fight for Its passage on the floor.
-Public healings, at which President
Wilson and others will be asked to tes
tlfy, will begin in a few days.
The striking differences between tne
new bill and the one which failed in
the senate last year are modifications
of the government operation feature
and broadening of the powers of the
shipping board which it is proposed to
create. Government operation under
the new bill would be entered upon
only as a last resort, if private capital
failed to respond to the enterprise. The
shipping board would be empowered
to regulate all Interstate and foreign
commerce In American waters as the
interstate commerce commission now
regulates interstate railrcad traffic
Every effort has been made to draw
the bill so as to encourage American
capital to help upbuild the merchant
marine and to protect It from unfair
foreign competition, and government
vessels never would operate on lines
where an American' service was fur
nishing satisfactory service at fair
rates. .The out-and-out government
ownership feature of the old bill
aroused so much opposition that it was
generally conceded to have been one
of the primary causes or the raiiure or
the measure.
An appropriation of $50,000,000 for
the purchase or lease of vessels to be
obtained by the sale of Panama bonds
and the appointment of the shipping
board of five members are the first
objects of the new bill.
The secretary of the navy and the
secretary of commerce would be ex
offlcio members of the board and the
other three members would be "men
of large practical experience" in for
eign commerce.

TO 8PEAK IN MILWAUKEE

IN DEFENSE CAMPAIGN
Details of the Army and Navy Plans
Are Being Avoided by the President
In His Talks.
Cleveland, O., Jan. 80. President
Wilson left Cleveland tonight for Mil-.
waukee, where he plans to deliver one
of the most Important speeches of his
middle western trip tomorrow. He Is
believed to have sounded the keynote
of his -Milwaukee speech in a telegram
sent today to Senator Ollle James of
Kentucky, to be read before a meeting
of Austrians in New York. The tele
gram follows
' Telegraphs Greetings.
"May I not send my warmest greet
ings to the meeting, and will yon not
express for me my very deep and sin
cere confidence in the entire loyalty
and patriotism of the great body of
our fellow citizens who have strength
ened and enriched America by adding
their energy to our own out of the na
tions which have Joined in their stocks
to make a great America."
Because of the large foreign popula
tion in Milwaukee, the president is ex
pected to urge all Americans, no mat
ter where born, to stand for America
first. He will also repeat his warning
that the United States must be pre
pared because of the uncertainty of the
international situation.
Brief Platform Speeches.
Before arriving in Milwaukee, the
president will deliver brief platform
speeches at Waukegan, I1L,- Kenosha,
Wis., Racine, Wis., and possibly In
other towns through which his train
will pass. A committee will meet the
president at the Milwaukee station and
a troop of state cavalry will escort him
to the hotel. At 1 o'clock he will ad
dress a public meeting in the audi
torium and will leave at 4 o'clock for
Chicago to speak tomorrow night.
Well Pleased With Success.
The president and members of his
party have been well pleased with the
supam, rtf bin TnepMne-! In "Plt-tsbnrarh
and Cleveland. The arrangements have
been kept strictly non-partisan and
republicans and democrats have joined
In welcoming him. His demands for
Increased preparedness have met with
warm responses from his audiences.
While he has. talked with some demo
cratic leaders, politics have not been
discussed." In each speech he lias asked
support-for his national defense plane
from all people, regardless of party.
Advisors of the president said today
that in virtually every speech he will
continue to emphasize the policy that
the United 'States may be drawn into
the European struggle as the reason
why he believes the army and navy
should be strengthened without delay.
,s g,Tmg. thjs as the rea8on why
he has left - Washington to appeal to
the country. He has made it plain, he
thinks, that the people rather than
congress will determine . ultimately
what will be done.
To Support Continental Plan.
Notwithstanding the opposition of
Chairman Hay of the house military
affairs committee and other congres
sional leaders In Washington to the
administration continental army plan.
President Wilson expects to continue
to support it, giving the reason that
the nation needs a trained reserve
force under the authority of the fed
eral government. He has taken care,
however, to say the national guard
should also be strengthened.
Details Are Being Avoided.
' Details of the army and navy plans
are being avoided by the president in
his talks to the people. He has gen
eralized by saying a reserve army of
at least 500,000 trained men, a larger
navy and more coast defenses are
needed. He is telling his audiences
that the army and navy plans have
been carefully drawn up and that the
judgment of the executive should be
trusted.
Spent Sunday Quietly.
With Mrs. Wilson the president spent
Sunday here quietly. They had an
early breakfast in their suite.. Appar
ently the president was still fresh in
spite of his busy day yesterday. At
11 o'clock they motored five miles to
the Euclid avenue Presbyterian church,
where Rev. Alexander McGaffin, an old
friend of Mr. Wilson, is the pastor.
The president's plans were not known
in advance and only the usual congre
gation of the church saw him. At the
request of the clergyman, everyone re
mained seated until Mr. and Mrs. Wil
son had left. This afternoon they took
a long automobile ride and spent the
evening in their suite.
Mrs. Wilson Received Indians.
Mrs. Wilson received three Indians
in her room this morning and was
given a sweetgrass basket by Princess
Go-Wah-Heah-Doon-Gwa of the St.
Regis reservation In New York. Chief
Thundering Water and Chief Louis
Solomon stolidly shook hands with
Mrs. Wilson. They said they wanted
to meet her because they had heard she
was descended from Pocahontas.
