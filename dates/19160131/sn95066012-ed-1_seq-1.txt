ROUGH BASKETBALL

' In one of the roughest games of
basketball witnessed in Bennington in
years the local V. M, C. A. five Satur
day evening won from the Pastime
Athletic club quintette by a score of
47 to 24. One of the Adams' boys was
forced to retire early in the game
because of a dislocated shoulder and
later in the contest Denely, the Y. M.
C. A. forward sustained a sprained
ankle,
There were a number of clashes be
tween the players and once the game
was halted because of a particularly
raw instance of roughhouse. The Ben
nington team had a decide'd advant
age in that four of the original five
players were so much taller and heav
ier than their opponents. The Adani9
boys were mostly little fellows, but
through superior passing they held
their own during the first half of the
game. In the second half the Ben
nington team1 forged ahead and won
by a good margin. The line-up:

Or. Benjamin. Brewster of Colorado is
Elected. , ;. , ,
Boston, Jan. 27. The election Wed
nesday at Portland by the Diocesan
convention of the Rt. Rev. Benjamin
Brewster of Glen wood Springs Colo.,
as Episcopal bishop of Maine came as
a great surprise to New England Epis
copalians, churchmen as well as lay
men. His name had not before been
mentioned, and so far as is generally
known, had not been under consider
ation. Although a New England man
by birth, having been born at New
Havei in I860, educated at Yale and
a brother of Bishop Chauncey Bunce
Brewster of Connecticut, he was not
widely known in this section. He is
regarded ' as a moderate churchman,
so that his election as a successor to
the late Rt4ltev. Robert Cod man, who
was a high churchman, may be taken
as having been in the nature of a com
promise. .
v For the past six years Dr. Brewster
Jias been missionary bishop of wes
tern Colorado. He is a native of
Connecticut.

a lawyer by profession and a speaker
of marked eloquence, at one time a
member of congress, having been
elected to succeed his father.
While governor of Tennessee acting
in harmony with his convictions at
ihat time he vetoed a prohibition bill
passed by the legislature of his state
and defended his action in subsequent
addresses, but there came a day
when his views and convictions were
changed. The reasons for which he
will present this evening.
The citizens of the community are
cordially invited to attend. No ad

PARIS RAID
BigeHrcraft Drops 3 1-2 Tons Of
Bombs
DENSE FOG AIDS BALLOON
City Had Bean Warned but Inhabi
tants Manifested More Curiosity
Than Alarm.
Paris, Jan. ' 31. Twenty-four; -persons
were killed and 27 injured in the
Zeppelin raid over' Paris Saturday
night, according to' air Official state
inept given ' out yesterday.' Ten ; of
the wounded were placed in hospitals
owing to the' severity of their hurts.
A dispatch from Paris at 12.30 p. ni;,
says that 30 French aeroplanes search
ed the remote air regions above Paris
Saturday night for a Zeppelin raider
of whose appearance warning had
been given. By the time it had
reached the edge of one of the old
quarters of the city several of the air
men were able to make out its pale
yellow shape 14,000 feet from the
earth. Frightened, doubtless, by the
numerous war planes rising toward it
the Zeppelin wheeled and drove at
full Bpeed northward dropping in its
wake in the darkness a cargo of
about 3 1-2. tons, of bombs." Then,
continuing Us flight-at a great , atti
tude, the airship vanished .j.'N.t !;
' Parisians, had. been , warned ,half an
hour before by-fire engines, rushing
through the 'street . trumpetuig ' the
call known as "stand: to arms,'!- tf
the presence of the raider, i , The elec
trie street lights went out and -police-men
cautioned careless householders
to close their shutters and darken
their windows iihmediately. 'It was
still early in .the night, close to 1Q o'
clock, and many Dt-rsons . were in the
streets, the, cafes wero open and the
moving picture theaters j and, play
houses still entertaining their . aud
iences. Then, in all .parts of the city
could-be heard the whir of iiumerous
aeroplane .propellers while every
where, says a dispatch from.,. Paris,
people .went upon the balconies to
watch, for Zeppelins. Few Parisians ap
peared to believe the' raiders were
likely to come as they had been turn
ed back many times previously. But
suddenly in the northeast of Paris
thero was a great flare in the sky as
the Zeppelin dropped an llliiminant
so that those on the airship might see
whether they were over the city.
Then a bomb fell into a street, crush
ing through into the subway and
tearing a hole 15 feet in diameter, but
injuring no one. Quickly a series of
other detonations occurred sounding
dully throughout the city.
One of the missiles fell upon an iso
lated house occupied by a single fam
ily, j 7'ho 'building was bisected, one
end; being demolished and,, its occu
pants" hurled tar' out' into an open' lot
and; killed. J ' ' ;"; ;
In a hiore populous' quarter, a ibmnh
struck' a six story "apartment building
occupied by the' himilies 'of working
men, cutting it in twtf from garret to
cellar, burying 10 victims under'thc
debris of the central jirt of the struc
ture.. ..-A !' .V r
Altogether a dozen bombs weigh
ing about COO pounds each were drop
ped. None of the fatalities occurred
in the open streets, the majority of
the victims being killed in their beds.
One of the bombs fell in the court
yard of a hotel. A corporal return
ing from the front at Hartmans-Weil-erkopf
had just entered the hotel with
his wife, 'when the explosion occurred.
"My first move," said the soldier,
'was to He flat on my chest, compell
ing my wife to the same. We do this
instinctively when German shells
burst near us on the line. No sooner
had we done so when the girders of
the building gave way, precipitating
us to the floor below. Fortunately we
were only slightly injured. I had also
thought of asphyxiating gas, and cried
to. open the windows. But that was
not necessary; they 'were all broken."
Another bomb destroyed a modest
dwelling killing a husband and wife,
but only, slightly injuring their four
children. Iu curious contrast with
the general calm was the sudden
death from fright of the 62 year old
chief of the Gobelins telophone office
at the moment he learned of the Zep
ipelln raid. Seven t members of the
Petit Jean family were celebrnting
the return or a zouave on leave of ab
sence.. A bomb fell on the building,
destroying it and killing the entire
family, including the zouave.
, Five French aeroplanes hre said to
:have fired on the Zeppelin, one of
them pursuing it toward the west for
more than 50 minutes.
TRUE SITUATION IN BELGIUM
Much Suffering Must , Occur Unless
. Assistance is Provided.
To the Editor of the Banner:
Last December there was coii?.Jer
able confusion in the public niiBu as
to the needs of Belgian and conflict
ing reports in some of the New York
papers; I therefore wrote Governor
Gates and have now his answer: He
says:
"I took the matter in hand to learn
what I could about the real situation
and found that the reports printed in
'one of the New York papers' were
intended to apply only to the women's
organization. A letter , from Oscar
Strauss et als was forwarded to Bis
hop Bliss", (chairman of the Vermont
committee) This letter xpalned the
dilllculty as due to a bungling of the
New York press reports. The gover
nor continues: j
"I presume the situation is such
that not as much can be done as could
have been, accomplished if it had nqt
been .for these reports," and tho leteer
closes with thanks, under the circum
stances, quite undeserved. ' .'
Novv that It is eleatf.Uhftt there will
be great suffering fronji cold and want
if money is not provided., the Ben-!
nington committee plans a card par
ty ,in the early future to raise funds."
I venture to ask for sympathy and in
terest in' these efforts. "

Chairman of the Bennington Com
mittee. POWER OF REPETITION
Boring into Public Attention Daily
Will Get Results.
There is no power upon the human
mind as great as the power of repeti
tion. The Mohammedan and some
other religious teachers show vicious
understanding of 'this fact In their
educational methods you may see
pooi1 children, day after day, hour af
ter hour, reciting' the: Koran.. They
Ure brutalized but they . know - the
Koran, , Repetition gets it into their
heads. , ', .. ;' ;., j '
The Roman in the senate using the
same 'words every time he spoke
caused,: by repetition, the destruction
of Carthage. Political parties, and
men who advertise, and those that
teach good .habits to-the-young learn
that the one great force is repetition.
The; young mother in the streets car
looking down at the child in her arms
said; 1,000 times in succession. "Mam
ma, Mamma, : Mamma." Nothing else,
only that one word,' "Mamma That
baby learned to say "Mamma," at-an
unusually early age through repeti
tion;
The wisdom or ' ancient s peoples
lives in proverbs easily and constant
ly repeated.
The courtship which culminates in
marriage consists largely of the repe
tition of the same sentence millions
of times. It sounds dull to outsiders
hut it brings results.
To teach, or persuade, or frighten
or interest you must first know what
it is that will give the result you de
sire and then repeat that thing.
Don't let anybody mislead you in
to the thought that brilliancy or wit
or great -variety can possibly, take
repetition's place. ;:,
If; you were locked, up in a atone
cell and wanted to roach tho outer nir
youj would start tomake a hols and
you! would keop boring at tlie :-' snme
spot That Is repotitiion. !:.!
i ,Tie business man who is locked in
by the-stone walls - of ..competition,
limited to his neighbbrhood and who
wants to got out into the fresh air of
big 'success, must do what the pirson
er would do in his cell. ' -.: ;
You must say the right thing; you
must choose your tool intelligently.
You cannot dig your way out of a
stone cell with a tallow candle.
Get a good thing, then use it re
peat it. Remember that the purpose
of advertising is not the display of
our ingenuity or of advertising liter
ary athletics. The object is to con
vince and to sell.
Bore your hole into public attention
by the dally statements and you will
get results.
Keep boring in the same place.
Danton told the French revolution
ists that what they needed was au
dacity, more audacity, still more au
dacity. What the business man needs for
his success is repetition, more repeti
tion, still more repetition. Pilgrim

given by the Strollers as one of the
best entertainments in the course.
So good were they, indeed, that they
were accepted as Cliautauqua artists.
Public opinion, as woll as private Judg
ment, indicate that the Royals are ful
ly up to the standard of the Strollers.
This Is the 'seventh season of 'their
