(By Associated Prsse-i
Parts. Jan. 31. Twenty four persons
were killed and twenty-seven Injured
In the Zeppelin raid over Paris Sat
urday night, according to an official
statement Sunday.
Warning of the appearance f the
raider was given by fire engines rurh
Ing through the street trutnitlng
the rail known as "stand to irmi."
The electric lights went out and po
licemen cautioned careless honschoil
era to close their shutters and darken
their windows Immediately.
It was stilt early In the night, done
to 10 o'clock, and many person were
in the streets, the cafes were open
and the cinematograph theaters and
variety houses were still entertaining
their audiences, when In all parta of
the city was heard the ominous sounds
of the warning bugles, succeeded by
the nervous whirr of thirty French
aeroplanes which rose swiftly Into
the remote air regions to meet the
winged enemy. Many persons sought
balconies to watch for the coming of
the raider.
Raider Traveled Three Milts High.
By the time the Zeppelin had
reached the edge ot the old quarters
of the city several of the airmen were
able to make out Its pale yellow shape,
14.000 feet from the esrth. Frighten
ed doubtless by the numerous war
lanes speeding toward It. the Zeppe
lin wheeled and drove at full speed
northward, dropping In Its trail Into
the darkness a cargo of about three
and one-halt tons of bombs. Then,
continuing Its Might at a greater alti
tude, the airship vanished.
Few Parlslana had believed the
raiders were likely to come, as they
had been turned back many times.
Out suddenly in one of the northeast
ern parts of Paris there was a great
flare in the sky as the Zeppelin crew
dropped an lllumlnant to show wheth
er they were over the city. A bomb
fell Into a street crushing through
Into the subway and tearing a hole
fifteen feet In diameter, but Injuring
no one. Quickly a series of other
detonations occurred, sounding dully
throughout the city.

the last few days of tbe week just

tion concerning the establishment of
the course for oil mill operators.
President Blxtell said today that the
plan of the committee would be con
sidered and added that the college
wa In sympathy with tbla movement
which originated with the oil mill
men. According to E. J. Fermier. pro
fessor of mechanical engineering, who
ha been In conference with the oil
men, such a course a they are urging
could be derived from tbe present me
chanical engineering course with very
little modification. The construction
of a small but thoroughly modern oil
mill in addition to the present shop,
foundry and other equipment of tbe
mechanical engineering would be nec
essary, however. Thorough ground
ing In mechanical engineering, the
handling of labor, cost accounting,
with the last two years offering spe
cialized work in chemistry would fit
men admirably for this work.
"It Is almost impossible to get men
for the positions of superintendent
or managers of cotton oil men who sre
capable ot filling the bill' aald the
visiting mill men. "We believe that
college men with the proper Instruc
tions in tbe theory and a mill In
which to receive practical Instruction
would make admirable mill mana
gers and superintendent. Of course
at tint we would have to put them
on a foremen or In some such ra
pacity, but the field I practically un
limited for men of intelligence and
Industry."
An effort to Interest machinery men
will be made by the millers.
