done the timber on the reserve will
be cut down and the proceeds will

Short Practice.

BRILLIANT PLAY
Fumbles Numerous Berrigan Out
plays Taller and More Experi
enced Opponent.
At the Armory Saturday evening
the newly organized "Big Bemidg"
basket ball team defeated the Ada
quint by a score of 23 to 14. This
was the first game of the season
for the local five and the players
showed up well, considering the
short time in which they had to
practice.
Ada Scores First.
During the first few minutes of
play neither side scored. Numerous
fumbles were made. Ada scored
first with a field basket. Another
double counter was secured several
minutes later and with a foul thrown
the visitors had a total of five points
to Bemidji's two. This was the only
time that Ada was ahead of the Be
midji team. Two baskets put Be
midji in the lead and from that time
on the local boys were in no danger.
Dribbles Length of Floor.
Peck at right guard started the
scoring for Bemidji, securing the ball
at the toss-up and dribbling it the
entire length of the floor and drop
ping the ball through the net. It
was the most brilliant play of the
evening.
During the first half all points
made by both teams were secured by
individual effort rather than by team
work. The first half ended with
the score 9 to 6 with the Bemidji
team on the long end.
Team Work Improved.
During the second half the team
work of "Big Bemidg" was more evi
dent than at the beginning of the
game. The guarding was good, Ada
not being able to score until the last
few- minutes- of pray when the visit
ors counted four times.
Howe and Diedrich were at the
forward positions for Bemidji. The
former played a steady game and
made two baskets, both being "loop-
ers." Diedrich played a creditable
game, this being his first appearance
in a Bemidji uniform.
Figure in Many Plays.
Berrigan at center, a new man on
the team, showed up well and out
played his taller and more experi
enced opponent. He also secured
three baskets.
Bestul and Peck at guards played
fast games, guarding their men
closely and figuring in nearly every
play.
The lineups were as follows:
Bemidji Ada

(Copyright 1916 by United Press.)
Berlin, Jan. 31.An effective
blockade against Germany is impos
sible, according to Admiral von Holt
zendorff, chief of the German admir
alty staff, who gave an exclusive in
terview to the United Press today.
"England," he said, "under no cir
cumstances could stop the commerce
in the Baltic successfully between
Sweden, Denmark and Germany. For
weeks no British submarine has been
successful in the Baltic. The Rus
sian fleet is frozen in Russian har
bors. The only effect a blockade
would cause would be some suffering
to women and children. The trade
across the Baltic is now absolutely
normal."
GERMANY PLANS TO
END CONTROVERSY
By Carl W. Ackerman.
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
Berlin (via Amsterdam), Jan. 31.
That Germany hopes to end the
Lusitania controversy and settle all
differences with the United States in
a note soon to be dispatched to Wash
ington, will be the substance of a re
port to President Wilson by Col. E.
M. House, his confidential agent.
This was learned by the United
Press today on the eve of Col.
House's departure from Berlin from
persons with whom he conferred dur
ing his visits to the German capital.
Conferences Held.
The German chancellor, von Beth
man n-Hollweg, Foreign Secretary
von Jagow, under Foreign'Secretary
Zimmerman and many prominent
business men and bankers discussed
the situation with the president's
emissary to Europe.
Germany Friendly.
Col. House, the United ^P^ess
learned, will report to President Wil
son that Germany is most earnest in
her desire for a continuance of
friendly relations with the United
States. He has been informed that
German officials desire to clear up
not only the Lusitania question, but
all controversies yet unsettled.
Col. House left Berlin for Paris
Saturday.
May Disavow Sinking.
Washington, D. C, Jan. 31.Col.
E. M. House possibly has succeeded
in obtaining Germany's disavowal of
the Lusitania sinking, which would
assure the end of the Lusitania con
troversy.
This was the interpretation placed
Sunday by Washington officials on
news sent by Carl W. Ackerman,
United Press correspondent from Ber
lin, telling of a forthcoming note
with which Germany hopes to avert
a break with America.
The controversy at present hinges
on the difficulty in reaching an un
derstanding on the demands of the
United States that the sinking of the
Lusitania be disavowed by Germany.
