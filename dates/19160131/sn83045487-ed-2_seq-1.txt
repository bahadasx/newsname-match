WHAT LOUIS BRANDOS
MEANS TO THE PEOPIE
Has Championed Humane Laws Criticism of Rail
roads Justified by Events Likened Steel Trust
Directors to Czar of Russia.
Louis D. Brandeis, whose nomina
tion for the United States supreme
court is now before the U. S. senate,
has held no office, but during the past
ten years he has been one of the na
tion's great constructive statesman.
He has criticized freely, but his
criticisms were all aimed at bringing
about better things. Years ago, when
he vigorously opposed higher rates
for the railroads, he said that if the
transportation companies would put
into practice reasonable efficiencies
Jthey would need no rate "-increase.
The presidents and general managers
laughed him to scorn, but the divi
dend days of this winter of 1916
brought to this idea of his a wonder
ful victory.
When the hard times of the war
came in 1914, the railroads were com
pelled to put into practice the very
efficiencies suggested by Brandeis,
with the result that scores of them
saved millions in 1915, enabling them
to not only weather the storm, but
also to declare increased dividends
in many cases.
