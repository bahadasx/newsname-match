FRONTAGE TAO TAKE-
CARE OF CITY STREETS
Suggesting to the officers - of the
Honolulu Automobile Club a $1,000,000
bond issue to build country 'roads
about the island, and urging them to
back the city and county in the pres
ent frontage tax plan of laying city
streets, City Engineer George .M- Col
lins'spoke briefly on the road question
at a noon luncheon hel at the Com
mercial Club today. - .
. Following. I Engineer Collins' r talk
the question of a bond issue was dis
cussed favorably -' by those present
President J. L. McLean stated that fre
believes the automobile -club' will be
back of any move that will bring good
and .permanent roads.'
"I believe that the operation of the
frcntaee tax law Is to be the eolation.
urftuf strtret duestionr said lln Col
lins to" bis talk; rwe have reached
the stage where Mt; is no longer eco
nomical in the majority of cases to
repair our streets. The time has come
when we must build new; ones.' and
if we have united backing . from all
the people the work ..will move .- that
much faster. : -l ' ' , , ; ' '
Bond Issue Is Best Way. -..
' "e question of money is .a; big
Item with the city, now, and for the
outside districts, . such as . Kailua,'
Waimanalo and Nru, I see no other
wayv to get good and lasting roads
than by a bond issue." ,
Collins suggested for the handling
of this issue approximately $1,000,
000 a committee of competent busi
nessmen who shall make a carerut
study of the question and secure from
the mainland the very best engineer
available to carry out the work. Ho
nolulu engineers could work, under
this engineer, he said.
"I do not Intend to propose some
dogmatic system of - city pavement
and fight it through without considera
tion of details," the- engineer declared.
The question of economy and what
the Deode are able to pay for must
be considered, as well as the location
of the street, its drainage and its soil.
Concrete Should Be Covered.- . :
"I believe that concrete should be
covered, and that . on ; Kalakaua ave
nue there should " be at least- five
inches of concrete base to bear on top
a two-inch layer of, sheet asphalt or
warrenlte. -t
One of the advantageirof carrying
out road work on. the policies -he bad
outlined comes from the fact that the
work can be let by contract, the city
thus getting dollar for dollar of its
money, the engineer said.
" Following his talk the engineer an
swered several questions regarding
the Workings of the frontage tax-law
and the general policy of the engineer
ing department. - j
