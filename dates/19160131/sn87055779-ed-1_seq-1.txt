INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. r.l. -Fears
of a repetition of the 191"! flood in
Indiana were freely expressed today.
White and Wabash rivers and many
small streams are on a rampage
second only to the great disaster
three years ago. when damage
amounting to many millions of dol
lars was caused. While White river
is rising at the rate of six inches an
hour, caused from the heavy rains
which have fallen for the last f,0
hours, not so much alarm is felt in
this city, for with the exception of
one unfinished spot in the nw flood
vail, the west side is fairly well
protected.
At Iwifayette and Terre Haute
conditions are not so bad. but many
families are deserting their homes
in threatened sections.
The Ohio at Evansville has passed
the flood stage for the fourth time
in seven weeks. A continued rise is
expected for a week because of the
great volume of water the smaller
streams are pouring into the big
river.

10W REACHES LAND
Panic Prevented
By Music When
Ships Collide
Infernat!ii:il News Servi-.-e:
LIVERPOOU Jan. ;tl. Merry
dance tunes played by the musicians
of the liner Philadelphia prevented
a panic on the American essej
when it was damaged in a collision
with the English sailing ship. Ren
Lee. Saturday night. There was a
rush for the fleck's when the crash
came, but the ship's band immedi
ately struck up and the music and
calm words from the officers sub
dued even the most excited.
Many of the passengers made res
ervations on other ships today, hut
some said that they would remain
in Liverpool until the Philadelphia
was repaired.
The work of repair was well
under way today, but the liner may
be unable to leave before the end
of the week.
Examination of the Philadelphia
was completed this afternoon. It
showed that the damage suffered by
the liner was such that no definite
time could be set for her to sail, and
arrangements may be made to trans
fer all her passengers to the Adri
atic, sailing Wednesday.

United States Will Refuse
Clearance Papers to
Armed Steamers.
International News Service:
WASHINGTON, Jan. CI. The
United States will insist that the en
tente allies agree to disarm their
merchant vessels or they will be
denied clearance from American
ports. This is the attitude that the
state department has decided to
take despite the unofficial announce
ment from London and I'aris that
the British and French govern
ments intend standing on the here
tofore accepted rule that merchant
vessels have the right to carry guns
for defense.
As soon as the official text of this
decision is received by Sec'y of
State Landing he will renew the
original proposition. He will also
make it plain that the entire ques
tion of compelling submarines to
observe the requirements of stop
page and search of merchant vessels
before sinking them hinges on the
point of whether the entente gov
ernments have directed merchant
vessels to carry guns to resist at
tacks by submarines.
Sec'y Lansing will not decide how
the second note on the subject will
be framed until he has received of
ficial refusals to his original in
formal suggestion that the entente
allies acree to disarm their mer
chantmen. It was made very plain
at the state department today,
however, that the Lusitania nego
tiations will have no part in the
exchanges on this subject. The
Lusitania is a separate matter and
the entente allies have been so in
formed through their emhassies
here.

a wireless that the Clyde ship Mo

Internntional News Service:
WAS H I XGTO X Jan. 31. Six
vessels of the coast guard and naval
service are combing the waters of
the Atlantic from the Virginia capes
south to a point beyond Charleston.
F. C, for the submarine K-Ü, miss
ing more than 2 4 hours. The sub
marine is commanded by Lieut. R.
C. Brady and carries a junior lieu
tenant and a crew of 18 men. Ac
cording to navy department officials
she is one of the best submarines in
the service and has a perfect record.
The K-5 became detached from
the parent ship. Tallahassee, while
proceeding south from the Brook
lyn navy yard to the Florida drill
grounds some time after 1 o'clock
Sunday morning. S'ince that time
no word of her whereabouts has
been received and officials, whil in
sisting that she was "probably
simply lost in the fog," were admit
tedly very anxious today.
Sent In Soa it'll.
By orders of Sec'y of the Navy
Daniels, the coast guard cutters
Yamaeraw and Seminole, the light
house tender Manprove, the subma
rine tender Panther and two de
stroyers have been sent out by Com
mandant B. C. Bryant from Charles
ton to search for the missing vessel.
Submarines of the K-T type, while
equipped with wireless, can com
municate only with a radius of 50
miles, and if the K-5 lost her way in
the fog she might easily have gone
that far beyond the wireless limit of
the searching squadron. .
In addition to Lieut. Brady there
are on board the missing submarine
Junior Grade Lieut. Hugh C. Frazer
and her regular crew, all highly
trained men who have been serving
in her for several months. S'he is

The vessel was built in 1G13 by
the Kkctrie Boat Co. at their yards

sioned on Aug. 1914. Last
summer she made a trip from New

International News Service:
INDIANAPOLIS. Ind., Jan.
Efforts to amend the constitution
the United Mine Workers of Ameri
ca to exclude members of the state
militia and state constabulary failed
in th convention this morninc. The
delegates adopted the report of the
committee on constitution which was
against the proposed measure. The
resolution wa. introduced by Adolph
Germer of Illinois. Debate lasted
several hours on this question.
The miners sought legal advice in
the matter after Pres't Wilson had
advised against any such action as
it might be illegal. Henry Warrum,
general attorney for the organiza
tion, said such action would be ille
gal irasmueh n it would be against
the policy of public opinion and the
statutes of the states.
However, all those who spoke in
the de babe today expressed opinions
against the militia used as strike
breakers. With this measure out of the way
the convention only had the recom
meniition of Pres't White, .seeking
to reduce the size of future conven
tions to dispose of and it was
though probable the I r 1 convention
would close tonight.
