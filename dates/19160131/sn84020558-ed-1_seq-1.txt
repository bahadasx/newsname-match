The troops spent today in loading

For tiie first time in four and one

DKI1C NEW FLOOD MENACE
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
SAX DIEOO, Calif., dan. :J0. Telephone reports
were received early tonight from two sources that the
Cuyaniaca dam, at the source of the San Diego river-, had
broken, releasing three billion gallons of water, which has
created a new flood menace in a district alreadv inun
dated. A new flood poured down the Tia .7 nana river today,
standing four feet high near its mouth, which is at the
foot of San Diego bay. ,
A telephone message from Tecate said it was re
ported thcr'e that the Morena dam, sixty miles back in the
hills, had burst. Officials here, believing that if the re
port was correct, fifteen billion gallons of water im
pounded by the dam would tear a new channel for the
river across Coronado strand into the sea, ordered resi
dents of Imperial Beach, a hamlet on the strand three
miles north of the river, to flee for their lives.
First news of the
reported collapse
of the Morena Dam came through
Andrew Ervast, city engineer of Cor
onado and chief engineer of what are
known as the Spreckles interests in
this vicinity. Evarst, trying to leach
tl'.e Alexiian town of Tia Juana today
m-t a Japanese running along the
bank of the Tia Juana river.
"Cet back," cried the Japanese in
broken English, "tell people lots wa
ter coming."
Ervast could see a four foot wave
coming down the river. He turned
his aiitonioiiilc and spread the warn
ing. George Cromwell, city engineer
of San Diego, and others said that
nothing but the breaking of the -Morena
dam could cause the flood.
That the dam should go out was
generally unexpected. It stood I'll!)
feet high in a narrow gorge and was
built of masonry anil concrete bolted
with iron rods. The top of the dan
was L'"i feet wide and it was braced
wilh loose rock on the downstream
side. The rock fill on the upper side
o. the dam was derrieked and liand
l laced. A water supply was drawn
from the reservoir behind the dam
bv a tunnel through solid rock and
was conducted through a little watei
slied into a creek which fed the low
er Otay darn, the one that first went
out. The natural channel for the wa
ter, however, was down Cottonwood
Creek into the Tia Juana river. Il
was suggested by some that a cloud
burst might have brought today's
flood, bill engineers said not. The
sr.n shone here and fair weather was
reported in the limited area with
which communication was possible.
Colonel Edward Fletcher, owner of
tl:e Cuyamaca properties, was one of
'.hose who telephoned to a San Diego
newspaper that- be had received what
he regarded as a well authenticated
report that the Cuimaea dam, eighty
biles northeast of this city had brok
en, and that be was about to start
for the scene.
The second report came from em
ployes of the Edgemoor Dairy ranch
at Santee, Cal., owned by Walter
Duppee, son of John Duppee, of Chit-ago
and repdted to be a millionaire
The ranch employes said that thre?
horsemen had ridden into Santee, a
small settlement, to flee for safety
to the bills.
Efforts were being made early to
night to get into "communication with
Walter Duppee and his father who
have a winter home at Coronado. The
herd of dairy cattle owned by the
son is said to he one of the largest
of thoroughbred stock in the state.
Fears were entertained that this herd,
representing an investment of thous
ands of dollars, would be lost, as the
meagre report received indicated that
there was little time left the ranch
iiands in which to drive the cattle
to high, ground.

The lower Otay valley was an armed
camp today. Sailors and marines
from the battleship Oregon and the
cruisers Milwaukee and South Dakota
patrolled all approaches and pene
trated into the valley, with orders to
shoot looters on sight. Each carried
twenty rounds of ammunition. The
marines under Captain Charles T.

The sailors, under Ensign Hamilton

offered the only means of ingress into
the valley.
Fifty farm houses, according to per
sons acquainted with the valley, must
have stood in the path of the flood.
It was estimated that from four to five
persons occupied each of these, though
those housing orientals held a larger

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
SAN DIEGO, Jan. 30. The list
of dead due to the floods which
have ravaged valleys of San Die
go county during the last four
days took another jump early to
night, with the total of recov
ered bodies standing at thirty
four, and the probable total cas
ualties at about sixty-five.
No one has attempted to place
a figure on the staggering proper
ty loss sustained, which has been
variously estimated at from $250,
000 to more than $1,000,000, and
even upwards. Three hundred
persons were reported homeless
as a result of the floods, and
much suffering was reported not
withstanding effective efforts to
organize a relief bureau to ad
minister to their needs.
"With a willingness and energy
which have been rewarded with high
commendation on all sides. United
States army and navy authorities
have stepped into the breach, supply
ing fe'uerds, relief parties, hospital
cups and officers and doctors to di
nct their movements.
Sixty dav's within which to even
temporarily repair such damage as
can be repaired was the time limit
ventured by business men of the city,
who conferred informally today at
the camber of commerce, as neces
bary to restore conditions to anything
like normal. Sunshine and lots of it
from now on is what all pin their
hopes on. It was expressed generally
today that with more rain there
would be no way of telling when re
pairs might be completed, and it was
certain that it would add to the suf
fering of the flood victims.
The day was one of conflicting ru
mors and reports from widely scat
tered districts and embracing practi
cally all the flooded areas. First
came the report of looting by armed
Mexicans in the Otay valley, where
marines were promptly sent to check
the operations of the marauders and
then the report to Rear Admiral Wil
liam F. Fullam, commander of the
Pacific Reserve Fleet, that twenty -one
bodies had been recovered, bring
ing the total Otay valley dead up t-
twenty-nine recovered, including eight
identified dead.
This report was questioned ann
Coroner Otto Marsh discredited It
upon investigation, but is was reiter
ated again tonight and amplified
with a teport that still five more 'bod
ies of the Otay valley victims had
been recovered by the marines and
sailors.
One of the Ixidies was that of an
unidentified woman whose arm was
sighted thrust from a vile .of brush.
The body was found imbedded in mud
and. had to be dug out. The body of.
a Japanese was found nearby when
a sailor stooped to pick up a Bhoe,
which it was found encased one of
the dead man's feet.
Shortly after noon a report was re
ceived that a four foot wall of water
was advancing down the Tia Juana
valley, said to have been due to a
break in the Morena dam, sixty miles
back in the I-aguna mountains. Later
this was contradicted, persons tele
phoning from Tecate a report that .
a family had arrived there, from Mo
rena Saturday night with a report
that the dam was intact, but that a
tremendous volume of water was
spilling over the top of the dam,
which impounds fifteen billion feet
of water.
On top of the Morena dam reports
came the one tonight that the Cuya
maca dam, eighty miles northeast of
San Diego, had broken, turning Its
three billion feet of water into the
San Diego river at the source of
which the dam is located.
Today the first during which the
sun was unobscured, proved a busy
one for hundreds and afforded thous
ands of others an -opportunity for
