President Strikes Highest
Pitch in Preparedness
at Milwaukee.
GETS HEARTY WELCOME
Cheered by Crowds Makes
Speeches En Route In
Chicago Tonight.
Chicago, Jan. 31. President Wilson
passed through Chicago early today en
route for Milwaukee where he is due
to deliver at 2:20 p. m. an address
which some of his party believe will
be one of the most important of his
tour of the middle west to advocate
national defense.
The president started on the last
stage of his tour refreshed by a day's
rest yesterday in Cleveland. His spe
cial left Cleveland at midnight and
was due to arrive in Milwaukee at
noon today. The president and Mrs.
Wilson expected to hold a brief in
formal reception at the hotel and to
lunch in their suite.
Speaks From Platform.
The trip from Chicago to Milwaukee
was to be broken by the first of several
brief addresses by the president from
the rear platform of his private car.
Three such addresses were on the pro
gram: at Waukegan. 111.. 10:50 o'clock:
at Kenosha. Wis., 31 o'clock, and at
Racine, Wis., 11:23 o'clock. At none
of these places, it was thought, would
the president deliver more than a five-
minute address. During the ride from !
Chicago to Waukegan he devoted much
time to correspondence and preparing 1
material for his Milwaukee address.
Because of the large foreign popula- j
tion of the city, it was thought 1 e
would touch on the duties of natural
ized Americans in their adopted coun
try in connection with the prepared
ness policy.
President Wilson expects to leave
. Milwaukee at 4 p. m. for Chicago, ar
riving at C p. m., two hours before he
lsto address an audience at the Audi
torium here.
The train to which was attached the
special car bearing President Wilson
and his party readied Chicago at 8:15
a. m. today. Despite the early hour a
crowfl hu'l L.-ithered at the La Salle
street station to greet the president j
and Mrs. Wilson. I
The four oars hearing the president's '
party were switched from the train at J
the La Salle street station and hauled j
over switch tracks to the Northwest- j
ern terminal, where they lay until the i
departure for Milwaukee, scheduled !
for 9:30 a.m. i

submarines K-l, 2 and 6 came into
the Charleston harbor at 9:30 o'clock
this morning. They were held outside
all night because of the dense fog.
Officers of the Tallahassee were ac
credited with the statement that noth

The possibility that the K-5 might

Second Attack Upon Paris
Within Twenty -Four

DROPS SEVERAL BOMBS
No Damage or Loss of Life
People of the French
Capital Stirred.
Paris, Jan. 31, (6 a. m.) Several
bombs were dropped by the Zeppelin
which flew over the outskirts of Paris
last night, but they produced no such
deadly effect as on the occasion of the
raid of Saturday night. The official
press bureau, gave out the following
statement this morning:
"A German dirigible set out in the
direction of Paris, where it arrived
soon after 10 p. m. It was bombarded
by our special batteries and attacked
by our aeroplanes. Before returning
northward it dropped a number of
bombs, which, according to the news
received so far, did no damage."
Representatives of the Matin who
visited the scene of the raid say that
no damage was done by the bombs.
Three of them fell on a piece of waste
ground and three others in a field.
A police inspector saw the three
which fell in the field. They were cov
ered with a cotton-like substance
which burst into flames. The inspector
characterized them as Incendiary
bombs.
Little was seen of the Zeppelin, on
account of the weather conditions.
The Matin says that it has received
information from the postmaster of
one of the places over which the Zep
pelin passed that a number of bombs
were dropped together. The inference
is drawn that the Germans, seeing
themselves threatened by French aero
planes, decided to loose all their
bombs at once.
The censors allowed foreign corres
pondents to telegraph whatever details
they could obtain but the Paris morn
ing papers have many blank spaces.
Reprisals are Demanded.
The press is unanimous in demand
ing reprisals for the two zeppelin raids
on Paris and also calls for greater ef
ficiency in the aerial defenses of the
city.
"It is not enough to be Indignant at
such tactics, which dishonor war it
self," says the Matin. "Public senti
ment expects something else. It de
sires reprisals immediate and exem
plary reprisals."
Stephen Pinchon, former foreign
minister, says in the Petit Journal:
"The people of Paris will preserve
their calm, but will notpare any per
sons who may have been guilty,

mastery of the air over the enemy
which the neonle had been led to be-
lieve France possesses.
Francis Capus, the dramatist, says
in the Figaro:
"Paris is entitled to a striking re -
venee in the near future. One cannot
rinuht nur air fiervic is flhle to exact
it."
Aeroplanes Fight Zeppelins.
Five French aeroplanes engaged the
Zeppelin which on Saturday night
dropped bombs on Paris, killing and
wounding over two score of persons,
according to an authoritative state
ment just issued.
The first to attack the German raid
er was a machine piloted by a ser
geant who was occupied in patrolling
the upper air." He pursued with sav
age energy, the statement says, but
soon exhausted all his stock of car
tridges and was obliged to abandon
the pursuit. One of two machines,
which were armed with cannon had,
however, by this time, managed to
climb up high enough and opened an
intense fire on the Zeppelin which
probably was hit, but not seriously
damaged.
The Zeppelin was next picked up by
a sub-lieutenant, as it flew over the
suburbs westward. He went up to
within 50 to 100 yards of the airship
and stuck to his quarry with grim de
termination, sometimes flying above,
sometimes below and sometimes on a
level, in order to escape the fire from
the Zeppelin's machine guns.
For 53 minutes the chase contin
ued, -the machine guns being freely
used on both sides, until finally the
aeroplane's engine broke down and
the' sub-lieutenant was obliged to
descend.
