CRITICISES LANSING NOTE.
London Paper Says a Von Bernstorff
Might Have Written It.
LONDON. January 31, 3:34 a.m.?The
Daily Telegraph, discussing editorially
the summary of Secretary Lano.n<s
note on submarine warfare and the
arming of merchantmen, says th it,
judging from the summary, one might
think it had been prepared by Count
von Bernstorff. It adds: "If Germany
cotild obtain such concessions, in order
to place herself right with humanity,
she would gain immensely. It ig a
case of making terms with murderers,
so that they may cont-nue their piracy,
lightly modified, but with !;ss clanger."
As an illustration of the effectiveness
of the measures takan by *3rent
Britain against German submarines,
the Daily Telegraph says: "At a moderate
estimate the Germans have lott
submarines to th? value from JC6,OOU.'>cO
to 417.000,000 since the war began."

CHIEF JUSTICE SAYS
Fines Aggregating $2,500 Imposed
on Four for Accepting
Race Bets.
SUPREME COURT HEAD
WARNS ALL OFFENDERS
Denounces "Pernicious and Insidious
Practice Which Saps Vitals
of the Body Politic."
Commenting on handbook making
in the District of Columbia,
Chief Justice Covington, presiding
in Criminal Division I of the
District Supreme Court, announced
from the bench today his
determination to stamp out of
Washington this "pernicious and
nsidious practice." which, he deMared,
"saps the very vitals of
:he body politic."
Four men entered pleas of
guilty to setting up gaming
:ables, where bets on horse races
night be made, when arraigned
jefore the court. Fines totaling
52.500 were imposed and peni:entiary
sentences aggregating
welve years were given and
suspended on condition that the
nen never again engage in acrepting
bets on horse races.
Three Fines Are Paid.
A respite of twenty-four hours was
given one of the defendants to raise
lis fine; the others were paid.
John W. Rice, the first "bookie" to
>lead guilty, was indicted April 5 last
>n information given to the grand Jury
>y William Green, the youthful cashier
>f the Postal Telegraph Company, who
s now serving a term of three years in
he penitentiary for embezzling the
company's money. The boy claimed that
he money was spent betting on the
aces with Rice. The indictment was
n eight counts, and the maximum fine
;ould have been $4,000. The chief jusice.
however, decided to make the fine
11.000 and to sentence RLce to a term
>f three years in the penitentiary. The
mprisonment was suspended during
he good behavior of the accused. He
vas allowed twenty-four hours to
alee the fine at the request of his
-ounsel, Alvin I-. Newmyer.
John J. Sullivan, Harry Elcholz,
^rank C. Short and John J. Kelly were
ndicted last spring as the result of a
-aid by Assistant Attorney Generfil
iarvey Given and-special investigators
>f the Department of Justice on a
louse in Girard street February 13 last,
rhe raiders secured a large quantity of
evidence, including desks, telephones
ind racing sheets. The four men,
hrough Attorney M. J. Keane, filed a
lemurrer to the indictment, alleging
hat it was defective in failing to aver
hat a horse race was actually run, on
which the bets were made.
Demurrer Is Overruled.
Chief Justice Covington overruled the
lemurrer, and held the indictment to
?e valid. He said he was constrained
:o hold that the allegation that a race
was actually conducted was not a
lecessary ingredient of the indictment,
tfe suggested that bookmaking could
is well be conducted on a fictitious
-ace just as "bucket-shop" gambling
8 done where the sales of stock are
lot made.
Assistant Attorney General Harvey
Jiven told the court that the government
wished to drop the indictment as
rar as it charged John J. Kelly with
vetting up a gaming table. Mr. Given

he room at the time of the raid, but j
nvestigation showed that he had Just
irrived from New York that day and
ivas merely paying a visit to his friend,
Sullivan. The court directed a nolle I
pros as to Kelly. I
Sullivan, Eicholz and Short then1
sntered pleas of guilty and were each
sentenced to pav a fine of $500 and to
serve three years each in the peni- ,
:entiary. The imprisonment in each
rase was suspended and the fines paid.
Says Practice Continues.
Mr. Given tha^ suggested to the court
hat a like disposition might be made
in the case of persons now under arrest
for the crime, but not yet indicted,
rhere were some of these, he said, who
ippear not to have taken warning
From their arrest and against whom he
has evidence that thev have since conducted
handbooks. In these latter
L*ases. Mr. Given said, upon conviction,
pr even on a plea of guilty, he would
feel constrained to ask the court for
i straight penitentiary term.
In commenting on the crime of horse
race gamDling the chief justice declared
r.e could not sufficiently estimate
its baneful influence on public morals
and on private character. Inevitably,
he declared, the bettor on horse races
is tempted to become a defaulter, and
to squander his money and sometimes
to render his family destitute. He referred
to the awakening of the people
generally to the appreciation that
gambling is a pernicious crime, and
cited the case of New York state,
where racing once ran from early
spring until late in the fall. This racing
had been -driven out of New York
largely because of the gambling connected
with it. he suggested, and such
gambling should also be eradicated
from Washington.
Without prejudging any future case
to come before him. tne court suggested
that after this warning such offenders
could not expect to be dealt with
leniently.

Denies Impulse Is Selfish.
President Wilson threw down the
gauntlet today to opponents of nai
tional preparedness who have declared
that the movement sprang from the desires
of munitions and armament manufacturers
to make money.
"There are some things that are
being said that 1 hope you will not believe,"
the President declared. "It is
being said, among other things, that
this agitation for preparation for national
defense comes chiefly from those
who are interested in supplying the
government with the munitions of war
and from those who are interested in
supplying it with armament.
"Gentlemen, do not allow yourselves
to be misled by statements of that
sort. Anything that the government
does somebody is going to make money
out of: but the impulse for this thing
! does not come fiom those quarters.
The impulse comes from men disinterested,
men who know the actual circumstances
of the country and who
know that these things are immediately
necessary.
Nation Can Protect Itself.
*1 for my part have all along advocated
and always shall advocate that the
government as far as possible shall
manufacture these things for itself, in
order that at any rate it may control
the prices at which these articles will
be sold to the government. If it is
necessary to protect ourselves against those
who would make money out of
the necessities of the nation, there are r
adequate means of defending ourselves, u
and we will use these means. 1^
"But I don't believe the impulse ?
comes from those quarters. I don't be- a
lieve that in those quarters there is r
patriotism lacking any more than there a
is patriotism lacking in other quarters."

Big Chicago Crowds Greet t
President and Mrs. Wilson
During Stopover in City .
CHICAGO, January 31.? '
President Wilson spent an hour 1
and a half in Chicago today en
route to Milwaukee, where he
speaks this afternoon. The train
bearing the President's party arrived
at the La Salle street station
shortly after 8 o'clock, and
was switched through freight
yards to the Northwestern terminal,
where the President remained
until his special departed for the
north at 10 a.m.
At the Northwestern station the
President and Mrs. Wilson posed for
photographers and took a short walk
on lhe platform. Mrs. Wilson accom- p
panied the party to Milwaukee. s
At both stations crowds numbering a
several thousands stood outside the Y
| gates. President Wilson appeared on p
the observation platform and lifted his ^
hat to the crpwd, but Mrs. Wilson re- ?
mained inside the car. T
The Frankfurter Zeitung report that <
the Lusitania reply from Germany was c
in Washington was read to the President
here today. He shook his head *
and said so far as he knew it was not 1
true. j
President Startled by Explosion. t
While the President was standing on '
the rear platform shortly before the E
departure of the train a sharp ex- I
plosion was heard. Secret service men J
crowded to the platform, and the Pres- t
ident. apparently somewhat startled, i
entered the car. A cloud of escaping 1
steam showed that the connecting hose
between the'rear coach and the one
next forward had burst. The President
soon emerged,'and stepping to the plat- (
form walked to where the break was
being repaired. ?
The President started upon the last a
stage of his tour refreshed by a day's fi
rest yesterday in Cleveland. His special
left Cleveland at midnight. A commit- 1
tee of business men. with an #?nnr? of t
cavalry of the National Guard, will 1
meet him at the station*in Milwaukee 1
and accom'pany him to his hotel. The
President and Mrs. Wilson expected to *
hold a brief informal reception at the a
hotel and to lunch in their suite.
i
Platform Speeches Listed.
The trip from Chicago to Milwaukee
was to be broken by the first of several
brief addresses by the President
from the rear platform of his private
car. Three such addresses were on the
program: At Waukegan, 111., 10:50
o'clock; at Kenosha, Wis., 11 o'clock,
and at Racine, Wis., 11:26 o'clock. At
none of these places, it was thought,
would the President deliver more than J
a five-minute address.
President Wilson expects to leave
Milwaukee at 4 p.m., soon after his
address is ended. His train is due to
reach Chicago at 6 o'clock tonight, two
hours before he is to address an audi- ;
ence at the Auditorium here. <

they took a long automobile ride,

Mrs. Wilson received three Indians in

tasket by Princess Go-Wah-Heah)oongwa

nd Chief Louis Solomon stolidly shook
lands with Mrs. Wilson. They said

Sends Message to Austrian?.
President Wilson is believed to have
tounded the keynote of his Milwaukee
speech in a telegram sent to Senator
311ie James of Kentucky, to be read be'ore
a meeting of Austrians in New
fork. The telegram follows:
"May I not send my warmest greet ngs
to the meeting and will you not
jxpress for me my very deep and sincere
confidence in the entire loyalty
ind patriotism of the great body of our
'ellow-citizens who have strengthened
ind enriched America by adding their
snergy to our own out of the nations
vhich have joined their stocks to make
l great America?"
Because of the large foreign-born
>opulation in Milwaukee the President
s expected to urge all Americans, no
natter where born, to stand for Amerca
first. He will also repeat his waning
that the United States must be
>repared because of the uncertainty
>f the International situation.
Pleased With the Meetings.
The President and members of his
?arty have been well pleased with the
uccess of his meetings in Pittsburgh
iiM Cleveland. The arrangements have
?een kept strictly non-partisan and republicans
and democrats have joined in
velcoming him. His demands for inTeased
preparedness have met with
varm responses from his audiences.
Vhile he has talked with some democratic
leaders, politics has not been
liscussed. In each speech he has asked
support for his national defense
ilans from all people, regardless of
>arty.
Advisers of the President said that
n practically every speech he will coninue
to emphasize the possibility that
he United States may be drawn into
he European struggle ^s the reason
vhy he believes the army and navy
ihould be strengthened without delay.
4e is giving' this as the reason why
le has left Washington to appeal to
he country. He is making it plain he
hinks the people, rather^ than Congress,
will determine ultimately what
vill be done. \
Firm for Continental Army.
Notwithstanding: the opposition of
Chairman Hay of the House military
ifFaifs committee and other congreslional
leaders in Washington to the
Ldministration continental army plan,
President Wilson expects to continue
o support it, giving the reason that
the nation needs a trained reserve
orce under the authority of the federal
government. He has taken care,
lowever, to say the National Guard
lIso should be strengthened.
Details of the army and navy plans
ire being avoided by the President in
lis talks to the people. He has generalized
by saying a reserve army of
it least 500,000 trained men. a larger
lavy and more coast defenses are needed.
He is telling his audiences that
he army and navy plans have been
arefully drawn up, and that the
ludgment of the executive should be
rusted.
SPEECHES PLEASE PEOPLE.
Reports of Enthusiastic Reception
Given to President Wilson.
White House officials along with
President Wilson are sending back
lubilant telegrams as to his reception.
3ne telegram states that the President
"is being received with great enthusiasm
and tremendous crowds. He
Is feeling line 'and la in splendid
spirits."
The impression conveyed by "the sender
of this telegram is that the trip Is
turning out to be a great auccess from
the standpoint of arousing the country
as to preparedness. The political effects
of the trip Ore not spoken of, but
the President's friends in Washington
express satisfaction with the results
so far. -

p.m.?The morning: newspapers of Ber- ii
lin today discuss extensively Secretary a
Lansing's circular note to the bellig- ^
erent powers on submarine warfare
and the arming of merchantmen. The
m
general tenor of the comment, especially
that in the conservative organs, b
is unanimously unfavorable. C<
An exception is found in the Berliner j-<
Zeitung, which declares that the news ^
that the note is designed to for- ^
bid the arming of merchant vessels is
of a joyous kind, as it is a severe blow
to England. n
The newspaper understands that it is 1*<
proposed that a merchantman carrying li
a gun is now to be regarded as a war
ship, and points out that warships have
the right to remain in a neutral port
- only twenty-four hours, far less than ^
e the necessary time to unload or load r<
a vessel. T
t Within International Law. ^
if It adds: "The strict carrying out of ol
