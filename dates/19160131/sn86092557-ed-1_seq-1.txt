meeting of the Board of Affaire in-the
office ;o? Commissioner J. Walter
Barnea this morning, all the Commis
sioners present, it was decided to ask
the Mayor to make a report of the
number of unsanitary "houses in Fair

have them burned. This action'by the
city was taken after a visit by the
members of the board to a residence
on Cleveland avonue,' where an Aus
trian, Mike Auetrich, died of tubercu
losis yesterday. .The House, according
to the Commissioners, 1b unfit for any
person to live in, the walls being damp
and tho floor no better than a stable
floor.
PriendB of Austrich asked the city
for help a few days ago, and the Com
missioners responded by. making ar
rangements to take AuBtrich to a hos
pital, but it was too late, as Austrich
died en route to the institution.
The Mayor will go, in company with
the city sanitary officer, to all houses
in Fairmont that are unfit for persons
to live in and make a list which will
be presented to the Board of Affairs.
They will further investigate the re
port, and if need be, to get rid of the
houses they will buy them and raze
them to the ground.
While speaking of the unsanitary
houses which landlords are renting to
people for some as low aB $5 a month,
the board heard one of the commis
sioners state that there are some
places that are actual hog-pens, being
rented to unfortunate people about the
city.
The Mayor's report on these houses
will bo heard next Monday at the
regular meeting. ?

(By Aflsoclated P*y?s) .
PARIS, Jan. 31?Several bombs were
dropped by the Zeppelins ?which^flew
over the outskirts of ;Parls;l(i.st night
but the produced; not such deadly, ef
fects as on'the occasion of. the raid on
Saturday night
The official press bureau gave out
the following. A German dirigible
Bet out in the direction of Paris where
it arrived soon after 10. ? It was bom
barded by our special batteries and
attacked by our aeroplanes. Before
returning north it dropped a number
of bombs which according to news so
far did no damage.
Representative!! of. the Matin /who
visited the scene of the raid say no
damage was done.
Three of them fell on a piece of
waste ground 'and three otherB fell in
a field. A police inspector saw the
three which fell in the ..Held. - They
did not sink deep In the soil. They
were covered with a cotton like sub
I stance which burst into flames. The
inspectors characterized them as In
cendiary bombs. ' . .
The nation says it has received in
formation from the postmaster of one
of the places over which the Zeppe
lins passed that a number of bombs
were dropped together. The inference
Is drawn that thtf" Germans seeing
themselves threatened py the French
aeroplanes decided to let loose all
their .bombs at once.
The censor permitted foreign corre
spondents to telegraph whatever de
tails they obtained but this morning's
papers have many blank. spaces.
