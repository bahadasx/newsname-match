"Italy will not give up Albania," the

that Italy, lacking sufficient troops of
her own, has asked for help from Eng

Review of War Situation.
Paris and its people escaped harm
in the second Zeppelin raid made on
the city within two days. The offi

attack declares, while the airship
dropped a number of bombs, no dam
age has been reported. Most of the
bombs fell on fields or open spaces.
There have been no further addi

Saturday night's raid, officially given

Quiet on Western Front.
While Isolated encounters and much
artillery and mining activity is re
ported, comparative quiet seems to
have settled down again upon the
western fighting front where the Ger
mans recently have reported notable
sucesses.
Aside from along the Franco-Belgian
lines, the military areas in which chief
activity ;s being displayed at present
are the Balkans and Caucasus front
where the Turks and Russians are
fighting near Erzerum. Athens reiter
ates reports received through diplo
matic channels that the Russians are
surounding Erzerum having inflicted
a fresh defeat on the Turks.
Italy to Continue Fight.
In Albania, the advance of the Aus
trians continues, but, according to re
ports today from German sources,
there is likely to be increased oppo
sition to them in the near future. It
aly, it is declared, has decided to con
tinue her Albanian campaign and has
landed another infantry division with
heavy artillery at Avlona with a view
to an effective defense of southern
Albania as a measure of political
necessity.

GERMANS MAKE
ANOTHER RAID
Zeppelin Flies Over Outskirts
of Paris and Drops Several-"
Incendiary Bombs.
REPRISALS DEMANDED
French Batteries and Aero
planes Attack Dirigible
Striking Revenge May
Be Inflicted.
Paris, Jan. 31, G a. m Several
bombs were dropped by the Zeppelin
which flew over the outskirts of Paris
lost night, but they produced no such
deadly effect as on the occasion of
the raid of Saturday night.
The official press bureau gave out
the following statement this morn
ing: "A German dirigible set out in the
direction of Paris, where it arrived
soon after 10 p in. It was bombarded
by our special batteries and attacked
by our aeroplanes. Before returning
northward, it dropped a number of
bombs, which, according to the news
received so far, did no damage."
Drop Incendiary Bombs.
Representatives of the Matin, who
visited the scene of the raid, say that
no damage was done by the bombs.
Three of them fell on a piece of
waste ground and three others in a
field. A police inspector saw the
three which fell in the field. They
did not sink deep in the soil. They
were covered with a cotton liko sub
stance which burst Into flame. The
inspector characterized them as in
cendiary bombs.
Little was soon of the Zeppelin on
account of the weather conditions.
The Matin says that it has received
Information from the postmaster of
one of the places over which the Zep
pelin passed that a number of bombs
wore dropped together. The inference
is drawn that the Germans, seeing
themselves threatened by French aer
oplanes, decided to loose all their
bombs at once.
The censors permitted foreign cor
respondents to telegraph whatever de
tails they could obtain, but the Paris
morning papers have many blank
spaces.
Press Demands Reprisals.
The press is unanimous in demand
ing reprisals for the two Zeppelin
raids on Paris, and also calls for
greater efficiency in the aerial de
fenses of the city.
"It is not enough to be indignant
at such tactics, which dishonorewar
itself," says the Matin. "Public sen
timent expects something else. It de
sires reprisals immediate and exem
plarv reprisals."
Stephen Physon, former minister,
says in the Petit Journal:
"The people of Paris will preserve
their calm, but will not spare any per
sons who may have been guilty,
through negligence, incapacity or lack
of foresight of not employing that
I mastery' of the air over tho enemy
I which tho people had been led to be
lieve France possesses."
Alfred Capus, the dramatist, says in
tho Figaro:
"Paris is entitled to a striking re
venge in the near future. One can
not doubt our air service is able to
exact it."

MEXICANS ARE
FACING DEATH
Awful Suffering in the Three
Northern States of the
Republic.
Chihuahua City, Me.w, Jan. 31.
Francisco Villa, according to reports
received here today, has been driven
out of the Picachos hills and Santa
Clara canyon and is now surrounded
by Carranza forces near El Valle.
El Paso, Jan 30 The starvation
and distress reported among the na
tive population of the Mexican state
of Sonora can hardly equal the condi
tions that prevail in the states of
Chihuahua, Coahulla and Durango, ac
cording to J. W. Newcombe, a British
doctor and journalist, who until re
cently served in a semi-official capa
city for the Carranza government in
northern Mexico.
"In Chihuahua state particularly,"
says Newcome, "I saw children, girls
and bojs as young as 12 and 14 years,
stark naked in the cold temperature
of the highlands Many of the women
were hardly better off as regards
clothing.
No Crops in District.
"Robust Mexican peons," continued
Newcomo, 'who easilv can eat sixteen
to eighteen tortillas at a sitting, now
have to subsist on two or three enkes
a day. Tho women and children get
less. There are no crops now and tho
small corn supply is rapidly dwindling.
Starvation will be rampant through
out northern Mexico before the year
is many months older.
"What little corn there is sells for
80 cents Mexican per liter, which is
more than Mexican workmen can earn
even under fairly normal conditions,
and there is practically no work to bo
had now."
Newcome added that the few Euro
pean physicians left in northorn Mexi
co report widespread epidemics of
pneumonia and typhoid among the
lower classes, while the death rate
from tuberculosis is rapidly increas
ing. Typhus fever, ho said, was not
generally prevalent in northern states
Newcome also declared that he per

WILSON SPEECH
STIRS PEOPLE
Throws Down Guantlet to Op
ponents of National Pre
paredness President
Loudly Cheered.
WARNS HIS HEARERS
Movement Not Initiated by
Manufacturers of War Mu
nitions Advocates Gov
ernment Control.
Milwaukee, Wis., Jan. 31. Presi
dent Wilson threw down the gauntlet
today to opponents of national pre
paredness, who have declared that the
movement sprang from the desires of
munitions and armament manufactur
ers to make money.
"There are some things that are be
ing said that I hope you will not be
lieve," the president declared. "It is
being said, among other things, that
this agitation for preparation for na
tional defense comes chiefly from
those who are interested in supplying
the government with the munitions of
war and from those who are interest
ed in supplying it with armament.
Warns Agajnst Misstatements.
"Gentlemen, do not allow yourselves
to be misled by statements of that
sort. Anything that the government
does, somebody is going to make
money out of it; but the impulse for
this thing does not come from those
quarters. The impulse comes from
men disinterested, men who know the
actual circumstances oi me country
and who know that these things are
immediately necessary.
"I, for my part, have all along ad
vocated, and always shall advocate,
that the government, as far as pos
sible, shall manufacture these things
for itself in order that, at any rate,
it may control the prices at which
these articles will be sold to the gov
ernment. If it is necessary to pro
tect ourselves against those who
would make money out of the neces
sities of the nation, there are ade
quate means of defending ourselves
and we will use those means. But, I
do not believe the impulse conies
from those quarters. I do not believe
that in those quarters there is pa
triotism lacking any more than there
is patriotism lacking in other quar-'ters."-
The president's declaration was de
livered from the rear platform of his
private car at Racine, Wis., an hour
before he reached this city.
Ten Thousand at Kenosha.
At Kenosha more than 10,000 per
sons braved a chilling wind to greet
the president, who made a brief rear
platform talk on preparedness. Mrs
Wilson smiled on the crowd from the
window but did not leave the car. As
the president was speaking a crowd of
school children was gathered close to
the platform.
"1 used to be a school master," said
the president, "but I cannot keep
these youngsters quiet. I apparently
have lost the art. I think the voices
arc being squeezed out of them by
tho pressure of the crowd."
Begins Milwaukee Speech.
An audience of 9,000 persons filled
tho auditorium when the president
began to mnke his Milwaukee speecn
at 2:32 p. m. The police estimated
that 5,000 persons had been turned
awny.
As the president arrived at the au
ditorium the crowd stood and cheered
long and loud. The band played
America. The committee of three
hundred on the stage started to sing,
the president joining and the big
house caught the air and joined in the
chorus.
Mrs. Wilson occupied a box near
the stage with Dr. Grayson.
Denies a Crisis.
"I want at the outset to remove any
misapprehension in your minds," said
the president. "There is no crisis;
nothing new has happened. I came to
confer with, you on a matter which we
should confer on in any event. o
should sco that our house is set in
order. When all the world is on fire

French aeroplanes engaged the Zeppe

dropped bombs on Paris, killing and
wounding over two score persons, ac
cording to an authoritative statement
just issued. The first to attack the
German raider was a machine piloted
by a sergeant who was occupied in

with, savage energy, the statement
says, but soon exhausted all his stock
of cartridges and was obliged to
abandon the pursuit One of two ma

badly damaged.
Tho Zeppelin was next picked up
by a sub-lieutenant as It flew over the
suburbs westward. He went up to
within 50 to 100 yards of tho airship
and stuck to his quary with grim de
termination, sometimes flying above,
sometimes below and sometimes on
a level in order to escape the fire
from the Zeppelin's machine guns.
For fifty-three minutes the chase con
tinued, the machine guns being freely
used on both sides, until finally the
aeroplane's engines broke down and
the sub-lieutenant was obliged to descend.
