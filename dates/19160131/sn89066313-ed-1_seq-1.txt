Columbia Special Koail District, liave
a-ki-il the Hocxne County Court to give
l lie commissioners the interest on the
road money held up while the MIs--oiiri
Supreme Court decision was

when the Supreme Court ruled the
money belonged to the commissioners.
The interest asked is ?1,2C0.
The law on the question of who gets
the interest while the case was in

the court admitted this morning they
didn't know whether the money should

"I am willing to turn the interest

Johnson said.

road district, said that probably no
legal action would be taken to force
the court to pay the money and that
the consultation witli the court this

Control of Touts A.- Pacilic.
Uj United I'ren.
DALLAS. Tex., Jan. ::i. The Could
interests today began their battle to
retain control of the Texas & I'acitic
Railroad. The receivership asked by B.
F. Hush, receiver for the St. Louis
Iron Mountain & Southern Railroad,
is expected to be one of the most hot
ly contested legal tights in corpora
tion annals. The petition was tiled
December 27 and the hearing is to be
gin today before Federal Judge Meek.
The petition, entered by the Hankers'
Trust Company of New York, alleged
that the interest on .2."i,000.ooo in sec
ond mortgage bonds, issued in- 1SSS.
lias been in default since I!lil7. The
total interest and principal in default
is said to amount to $11,000,000. The
petitioner asks an accounting of the
earnings and property of the railroad,
applicable to the payment of the
bonds.
The complaint alleges that for a
number of years the income from op-
c-ation, instead of being applied to pay
ment of interest on the bonds, was used
or improvements, betterments and oth
er purposes. The petition also includes
the New Orleans Railway Company, a
Texas & Pacific property in Louisiana.
Tiie Iron Mountain is the owner, sub
ject to pledge, of more than ?2:;,000.
000 of the $2r.,000,000 bonds Issued
under the mortgage. The business
war between the Coulds and certain
antagonistic interests are said already
to have been responsible for the In
ternational & Oreat Northern and the
Missouri Pacific receiverships. An
agreement as to the Texas & Pacific
property failed.
Oeorge J. Gould is president of the
Texas & Pacific, which has been con
trolled by the Oould family since the
days of Jay Oould. It operates under
a federal chaiter granted March 3,
1S71. The company was reorganized
without foreclosure in 1SSS. Recent
figures show the Missouri Pacific, also
in the hands of a receiver, and allied
lines, owned $0,553,000 of the Texas &
Pacific's outstanding shares.

Life in the Orient in Great Britain's
transient army, moving from station
to station, is not all pleasure and
sightseeing, as the layman might be
led to believe; neither is it fraught
with total misery, according to a for
mer officer or the twenty-third Gor

dent in the School of .Medicine of the
University.
There is much leisure time during
fair weather, although the general
daily routine, which consists, of phy
sical examination, care of clothing and
person, physical drill and care of
horses, must be rigidly carried out.
For default of this, demerits are given.
The unpleasantness comes during
rough weather, when there is hard
work, little sleep and discomfort

of the Boone County officials for the

State Auditor John J. Gordon. A num

"The only cause for the discrep

accompanying the report, "appears to
have been a poor system of account
ing. Also, the fee laws are not
clear. There is nothing to indicate
an attempt to retain money without
authority by law."
The audit was made at the recom
