BERLIN. Jan. 31. An effective
blockade against Oermany Is Impos
sible, Admiral Von Holtzendorf. chief 1
of the admiralty staff, declared in an
exclusive statement to the United '
Press today. England could not stop
the commerce on the Haltic between
Sweden. Denmark and Oermany. he
said. The Hritlsh submarines have
been unsuccessful in the Baltic and
the Russian fleet Is in frozen water.
He hinted strongly that ilermany Is
prepared for any English action.
"C.ermany looks earnestly but fear
lessly upon plans which would cause
suffering to women and children, but
because the blockade is Impossible, 1
Say It is a bluff. Anyone knowing
the Baltic situation will say that com
merce between Sweden and 'jermahy
Is absolutely normal. It Is four weeks
now since an English submarine had
any success its the Baltic. We intend
to make it more impossible for them
to succeed.
"England already hampers German
trade. "If a blockade were declared
now. it would violate International
law. for it would not only blockade
Germany, but a lea neutral countries
iils.ut her. England purposes to make
difficulties for our families, thinking
this will effect our men In the trench
es. It will for they will fight harder
"England's purpose in this war Is
to cripple Germany and destroy her
commerce After eighteen months
she is unsuccessful. An effective
blockade will have absolutely no ef
fect upon our military determination
for we are prepared for any emer
gency. "We have all things necessary for
v.ar for several years."
Asked how long the war will last.
Von Holtzendorff said:
"Until we are victorious. It will
last until the allies learn they cannot
accomplish purpose defeating iter-
many, win last long time."
"England does not fear the tier,
man navy, but she does fear Ameri
ca and the growing American navy,"
Von Holbondorff declared that not
more than 2.'. German submarine
have been lost. He said some sub
marines had gone through English
nets without damage.

Lying at the point of death with
hardly a chance given him for re
covery, Wendell S. Phillips, son of a
prominent Spokane family, Is at St.
Anthony's hospital an a result of a
shooting at the Palace rooming house
early yesterday mornmg, and Wil
liam i). "Whitey" Marren, a local
bartender, who is said to have done
the shooting, and Dee Matlock, well
known local man. are nelng held at
the county Jail. Matlock was the
only other person present at the
shooting.
The shooting Is said to have been
done during a scuffle over a gun be
tween Phillips and Marren. Phillips
was shot through the left groin, the
bullet severing a big artery and com
ing out through the back of the leg.
The same bullet, presumably, grazed
the right leg of Marren, inflicting a
shallow wound.
The affair occurred about 1:30 yes
terday morning in Marren'a room at
the lodging house. The statements
of the men agree that Marren and
Matlock were In the room drinking
from a bottle of whiskey which the
former had Just received from Cal
ifornia, when Phillips and Hen Rudd
entered the room.
ft seems that thejee, has been bad
blood between Marren and Rudd for
some time and a quarrel between
them very promptly ensued. Phil
lips statement Is that he and Matlock
prevented them from fighting and
that Rudd then left the room.
Then, according to a statement
made by the wounded man to hit
brother, mother, the doctor and
nurse, Marren. who had been drink
ing rather heavily, began quarreling
with him. and finally drew forth a
gun. a combination rifle and revolver
known as a ::Game Getter." Phil
lips stated that he rappled with
Marren in an atterrjpt to take the gur.
away from him ami thHt during the
scuffle. It was discharged.
According to the story' told by Mar
ren and Matlock. Phillips first se
cured the gun and struck the latter
over the head An abrasion on Ins
head Indicates that he was struck at
some time or other.
