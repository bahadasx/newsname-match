MANY STRIKMG
FUTURES FOR
COMING WEBt
Class Work in Potatoes
Takes up First Afternoon
of the Gathering.
WEATHER WILL
NOT AFFECT IT
Farmers Able to Reach the
City and Will Come in
Big Numbers.
With potatoes and silos and silage
as the topics for discussion, the sev
enth annual North Dakota Corn and
Clover Convention, and Mid-Winter
fair, opened in Grand Forks this after
noon. The moraine was given over en
tirely to placing the exhibits and reg
istration.
Farmers of the northern half of the
state are finding it difficult to get to
Grand Forks at this time, and conse
quently the attendance at the conven
tlon is not expected to be particularly
great, although officials are looking
for a large number the latter part of
the week.
Weather No Handicap.
Bad weather never has affected the
mid-winter fair, but the deep snow
this year has added difficulties that the
farmers are finding hard to overcome.
One farmer was three hours yesterday
coming five miles to Grand Forks, and
others have reported experiencing ev
en greater difficulties in going short
distances. In some sections, roads and
fields are impassible, while others
have to be covered very slowly. Big
drifts in the roads and ditches made
it extremely difficult to get anywhere.
But nevertheless, it is- expected that
the convention .will be well attended.
A number of farmers reached the ?lty
this morhlftr with- butter, gr&inafid
eon exhibits, and while conditions are
bad.they declared they got along bet
ter than they expected.
Potato Work Starts.
P. C. Clements, of Moorhead, Minn.,
field agent for Clay county, had oharge
of the potato work this afternoon,
while W. ,R. Porter, of .the extension
department of the state agricultural
college, had charge .of the silo and
stlage program. Tonight, Mr. Porter
presents the motion picture, "A Con
crete Romance,", depicting the con
structure of a modern silo and all the
processes the material goes through.
Pictures of the International Pit silo
also '\Vill be 'shown' by J. G.' Haney, of
the International Harvester company's
experimental farm.
Leonard von Berg, head of the agri
cultural department of the East Grand
Forks high school, attended this after
noon's session with his agricultural
class. Mr. von Berg and his pupils will
take an Important part in the week's
work, as will agricultural classes of
the local schools, Special plans are be
ing made to accomodate' the 'Grand
Forks high school classes.

Judging of the various departments
will begin tomorrow morning.. J. G.

judges have not been named..
R. F. Flint, commissioner, of agri
culture and labor, and Mr, Pierce are

P. R. Crane, of the extension depart
ment of the Great Northern railroad,:!*
expected to take part-in the activities
of the latter part of the week. At pres
ent, Mr. Crane is headinrg the patty
of North Dakota farmers who are
touring the dairy districts of Wiscon
sin.
The cprn exftlblt this year is not as
good as heretofore. .The year 1916 "was
an unusual? fcatf' ctrn year In North
Dakota, and consequently the exhibits
are far from belng .as comprehensive
and as good as formerly. The question
of securing gopd seed corn Is an Im
portant one, however, and consequent
ly it will take .up considerable time,
this week.'
Exhibit Excellent.
The.potato exhibit, is excellent, and
ihe small grain, displays are up-to the
usual standard-' The number of alfalfa
exhibits is testimony the Important
place this legume occupies In' the list
of crops. The dairy exhibit la one of
the biggest and bestin..tlM. history of
the convention.
