WITNESS FEE DEFICIT
MAY AMOUNT TO $50,000
Austin. Texas, Jan. II. District
clerks of m counties in Texas have
thus far sent in reports to the control
ei's department as to the amount of
outstanding "in county" witnesses fee
claims in their respective counties,
and a summary of these reports shows
the total amount outstanding is 128,
:"r.0S. When all of the counties in the
state have reported the total may teach
$50,n00, and It is the purpose of con
troler Terrell to recommend to the 35th
legislature that an appropriation be
made to pa these claims, and also
probably to have tne law repeaien. rn
Is the law passed during the Colquitt
administration which provides for the
payment of "in cotintr" witnesses in
felony cases: that is. to pay witnesses
who reside within the county of the
prosecution An effort was made to
lepeal this law by the last legislature,
but it failed Gov. Ferguson vetoed
the appiopriation of $1011,000 made to
pa such witness fees, thus while tne
Hv is in force there are no funds to
pay the witnesses.

PARIS, France, Jajj.- 31. Several
bombs were dropped by a Zep
pelin which flew over the out
skirts of Paris Sunday night but they
produced no such deadly effect as on
the occasion of the raid of Saturday
night. The official press bureau gave
out the following statement this morning:
"A German dirigible set out in the
direction of Paris, where it arrived
soon afteo 10 p. m. It was bombard

unt'l finall the airplane's engine J
broke down and the sub-lieutenant was
obliged to descend.
Itnld Ik Very Brief.
The Saturday raid lasted about one
minute and a half, while in the visit
of Zeppelins to Paris on March 21,
1015, four of these aircraft were over
or in the neighborhood of the capital
for nearlv two hours. They came at
that time under entirely different
atmospheric conditions, being plainly
visible in a clear sky. Saturday night,
the fog seriously interfered with the
work of the Parts aerial guard.
One of the bombs fell in the court
yard of a hotel. A corporal returning
from the front at Hartmanns-Weiler-kopf
had Just entered the hotel with
his wife, when the explosion occurred.
Both escaped injury.
Another bomb destroyed a modest
t? story dwelling, killing a man and
his wife, but only slightly injuring
their four children.
In curious contrast with the general
calm, was the sudden death from
fright of the 62 year old chief of the
Gobelin's telephone office at the mo
