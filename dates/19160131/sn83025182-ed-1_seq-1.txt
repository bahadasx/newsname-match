ON BOARD PRESIDENT'S SPE
CIAL, Jan. 31—President Wilson arose
early today and started preparations
for two big addresses he will make in
Milwaukee and Chicago within the
next twelve hours. In addition he
will make several brief speeches from
the rear platform of his train.
He is expected to appeal to those of
foreign lineage ^s well as those
American born, to unite with him In
building up the defenses of this coun
try against dangers "which threaten
it from without."
Tonight the president will speak in
the Auditorium at Chicago.
Friends of the president express
great enthusiasm over the receptions
•which have been accorded him at all
points. It is now indicated that be
fore the president concludes his pre
paredness campaign, he will visit on
different trips, nearly every portion of
the country.
The central west likes Mrs. Wilson.
This is clearly indicated in the recep
tions accorded her on the first few
laps of the president's swing around
the circle. On every vent of her ap
pearance with the executive, the ap
plause accorded her has closely riv
aled that of the president. Along the
route today eager faces peered
through the windows of the presi
dent's car. The eyes were for Mrs.
"Wilson and it is noticeable that en
thusiastic expressions of approval al
ways follow sight of her. It obviously
pleases the president.
Suddenly rising flood waters
•trengthened the belief that one or
more of the city's other water supply
reservoirs nad given away. Automo
biles were used in spreading the
alarm. Residents of Imperial beach,
at the mouth of the Tia Juana river,
down which the wall of water came,
fled for their lives.

to the Northwestern tracks for the
Journey to Milwaukee which begins at

The president, Mrs. Wilson, Dr.
Grayson and Secretary Tumulty had
breakfast in their car as the train
reached Chicago. Mrs. Wilson, It was
announced, will accompany the presi
dent to Milwaukee, not remaining in
Chicago for a shopping tour, as was
previously believed.
Mrs. Wilson wore a shirt waist suit
at breakfast this morning, and joined
with the president in waving at
crowds at the railway stations en
route.
The crowds at both the Chicago and
Northwestern and La Salle street sta
tions were not permitted to enter the
train gates, but were kept back by
policemen.
Five minute speeches at Waukegan,
Kenosha and Racine were to be made
enroute to the Wisconsin metropolis,
which was to be reached at 12:15.
The president speaks at Milwaukee
at 2 p. m.
On the president's return from Mil

policemen will guard. the line of his
progress from the Northwestern -sta
tion to the Blackstone and later to
the Auditorium.
The president today authorized a
denial of a Washington dispatch that
he has changed his views on the right
of Americans to travel on ships of
belligerent nations. It was stated that
he is not in favor of Senator Gore's
hill which would bar Americans from
such ships, but stands on the prin
ciple that a citizen of the United
States has unquestionable rights on
the high seas.
President Wilson's special train left
for Milwaukee at 10:07 a. m. today
after a two hour stay in Chicago.
As the train was about to pull out
from the station, an air hone exploded
with a blast and thrilled everyone in
the train. The president was assured
there was no danger.

BERLIN, (via wireless) Jan. 31.—
An effective blockade of Germany is
impossible, Admiral Von Holtzendorff,
chief of the German admiralty staff,
declared today in an exclusive state
ment to the United Press.
England, he said, could under no
circumstances stop commerce in the
Baltic between Sweden and Denmark
and Germany. For weeks, he point
ed out, no British submarine has had
any success In the Baltic. The Rus
sian fleet Is frozen in Russian har
bors. The only effect of a declara
tion of b]pckade by the allies, the ad
miral stated, would be upon neutrals
and upon the women and children of
Germany. He hinted strongly that
Germany is prepared for any action
by Great Britain.
"When I say a new blocake of Ger
many would be a bluff, don't misun
derstand me," feaid Admiral Von Holt
zendorff. "Germany looks earnestly
but fearlessly, upon any enemy plans
to cause her women and children to
suffer. But because such a blockade
is impossible I say it is a bluff.
"ABk any Swedish merchant, ask
Swedes in Berlin, ask anyone know
ing the Baltic situation. They will all
tell you that commerce between the
two countries is absolutely normal.
For four weeks no English submarine
has bad any success in tue Baltic.
We intend to make it more Impos
sible. Because an English blockade
of our Baltic ports is out of the ques
tion, an attempt at an effective block
ade would be a bluff. England al
ready hampers German trade. If a
blockade should be declared now. It
would be contrary to international
law. It would not be a blockade of
Germany, but of neutral countries
about her.
England's purpose is to make diffi
culties for our families, thinking this
will affect the men in the trenches—
and it will, for when the men learn
that their families are being madd to
suffer by the enemy opposite them,
tney will be more determined to fight
the harder.
England's purpose In this war, as
her offlcials have repeatedly Htated, Is
to cripple Germany tad destroy her
commerce. After eighteen months of

WASHINGTON, Jan. 31.—Missing
since one o'clock Sunday morning, no
trace of the submarine IC-5 "lost in
the fog" off Charleston, S. C., had
been found early today.
Gravest fears for the missing sub
marine and her crew of six men were
expressed. Officials held out hope,
however, that the submarine may
have merely lost her way or become
disabled. Every available naval auxil
iary from the Charleston and Norfolk
navy yards was today combing the
seas between Cape Hatteras and
Charleston,
A flotilla of destroyers, submarine
tenders, scout ships and coast guard
cutters were in the search.
After an all night vigil at the navy
department, the only word received
by wireless and wire, was the bare
statement that the K-5 was missing
when the rest of the flotilla of
boats, the K-l, K-2 and K-6 arrived
off Charleston. They had sailed Fri
day from New Tork for Pensacola for

MUCH ANXIETY CAUSED
BY MISSING SUBMARINE
The boats were all traveling under
their own power.
Reports to the navy department
were that the K-5 was last seen off
the Carolina coast north of Charles
ton. A heavy fog blanketed the sea
and when the other vessels arrived
off the Charleston bar, the K-5 did not
put in an appearance. The boats were
last together off Cape Rornain, where
the search is being centered. Navy
officials were at a loss today to ex
plain the disappearance of ihe sub
marine, no heavy weath-r having
been encountered. The Carolina
coast, wnile treacherous, was not be
lieved to have caused the submarine's
difficulty. That the commander may
have lost his way In the fog and run
aground, or run short of fuel and
forced to lay by until relief arrives,
were the explanations advanced. The
K-5 was authorized In 1911 and cost
$500,000.

C. Graby and Lieut Hugh C. Racer,
