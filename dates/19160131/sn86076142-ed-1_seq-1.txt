PLEASANT, EXPERIENCE OF
THREE TONOPAH HUNTERS
Returning from a hunting trip to
the Pahrump valley, where It is per
petual summer, a party of Tonopah
sportsmen underwent a rather liar
howing experience. The party con
sisted of M. J. Clifford, James McKay
and li. L. Prouty. Several miles south
of Cuprite their auto, which had been
bucking the snowdrifts, became dis
abled and while Messrs. Prouty and
McKay remained with the machine,
trying to bring it to life, Mr. Clifford
set forth for Cuprite to telephone to
Goldfield for a machine to come out
and tow them in.
This was 9 o'clock at night and in
tiie darkness he wan unable to find
the half way station, where there was
a telephone and lie started for Gold
field, nearly twenty miles further on.
All night he bucked the snow, at
times waist deep, at other limes walk
ing on the crust. At 9 o'clock in the
morning, in a state of utter exhaus
tion, he was picked up, almost In
sight of Goldfield and taken to town.
He was badly frostbitten, but reme
dies were applied and, aside from a
little stiffness, he seemed all right
when he arrived this morning by
train.
Mr. Clifford offered a very attrac
tive sum to anyone who would take
out an auto and bring in his compan
ions, but it was pronounced imiiossl-
ble. He then telephoned to the half
way house near Cuprite and Mr. Prouty
and Mr. McKay and their effects were
taken, with the aid of two pack ani
mala, to the half way house, returning
to Tonopah this morning by rail

Hay is hay In Carson valley these

ing for $12 per ton in the stack and
hard to get at that. The ranchmen
of the valley had grown tired of de
pending upon the big cattle com
panies to send their cattle in for feed
and make the price for hay, so they
bought their own cattle, feed their
own hay, sell their own cattle, hogs
and sheep, make a good profit all
around, and believe now that it is
the only system. Carson Appeal.

of the big bobs continued In service
until daylight. Although the hill was
crowded, no serious accidents occur

became so glassy that it was impossi

one was hurt, a bent fender being the
only damage.
