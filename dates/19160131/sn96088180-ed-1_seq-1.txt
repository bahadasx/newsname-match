fVIISSING
Feared Tha) Another of the
; U. S., Fleet of Undersea
; Craft Has Shared Fate of
! the F4 lost at Honolulu
Washington, Jan. 31. That the
K-5 has shared the fate of the F-4
sank off Honolulu, with loss of her
entire crew was feared at the navy
department this" afternoon.
At ono o'clock no word of the miss
ing vessel had come further than a
message saying she bad "exchanged
positions" by wireless Sunday morn
ing with the remainder ot the sub
marine flotilla while 50 miles from
Uharlestown.
Afterward when the flotilla crept
up to Charleston harbor, the K-5 was
missing. '
How many men were aboard the
diver is unknown, but officials in
clined to believe that all of Ler 28
cew were not there, but that per
haps some had gone with other ves
sels of the flotilla.
Wa
alple
ashington, Jan. 81. Bvery avail-
ship from the Charleston and
Norfolk navy yards groped through
tj)&,8 f filtweenjOapft. Hatteras and
Charleston today in search of the
submarine K-5, reported lost A
flotilla of destroyers, submarine ten
ders and scout ships were included.'
They found no trace of her, as far
as early reports showed. Hence
there was grave fear for her Bafety,
though officials expressed the hope
that she had merly lost her way or
had been disabled. Officials were
mystified at the occurrence, as no
heavy eeas have been reported.
Their only word after an all-night
vigil was 'that the submarine was
missing whenhe rest of the sub
marine flotilla reached Charleston.
It was suggested that the vessel had
been lost in a fog or had run aground
or gone Bhort of fuel.
The K-5 carried a crew of two
officers and 26 men. Her wireless
was capable of sending 75 miles.
i
special bond issue may be voted for
this purpose.
The dead recovered early today:
H. Amano, Japanese rancher; Carlos
Bega, employee Danerle winery;
John Jameson Dube, rancher; Mrs.
Margaret Dube; Carlos Evallo, Ital
ian employed Otay valley; Wm.
George Gallagher, plpewalker at
Lower Otay dam; 'A. Kato, Japanese
rancher; B. KItasaw, rancher; Jos.
Mosto, rancher.
Because of lack ot communication
and uncertainty about conditions in
the flooded districts, wild rumors
were afloat Sunday.
The city water supply is not in
danger and former reports of loss of
life were, greatly exaggerated
The great Morena dam, 60 miles
back in the mountains, is overflow
ing and has impounded Ave years'
supply of water for the city and sur
rounding towns.
The beautiful San Luis Rey and
San Pasqual valleys, in the northern
part of the county, also are hard hit,
although more definite Information
tempered earlier reports.
.The exact loss of life there is not
known, although several bodies have
been recovered.. Full reports ' from
New York, Jan. 31. That Colonel
Roosevelt does not Intend to remain
silent while President Wilson is voic
ing bis preparedness views and hit
willingness to fight in a good cause
was evidenced today from the col
onel's remarks before a Brooklyn
meeting last night
In this he took a fling at the ad
ministration for writing notes to Ger
many Instead of acting; this he lik
ened by inference to the tendecies of
Dickens' "Mr. Mlcawber." At the
same time be excoriated the govern
ment for not protesting against vio
lation of Belgium, rapped the Mexi
can situation and insinuated that
much of the administration course
savored of politics, with the foreign
vote involved.
Germany, he contended, had ac
ceded to submarine demands only be
cause England had made It unprof
itable to continue undersea warfare.

GONE SAYS
UIEU
President Tells Citizens of
Milwaukee That Danger
From a Divided Patricfei
Does Not Menace America
Milwaukee, Jan. 31. The din ot
applause from 9,000 throats and
9,000 pairs of hands, followed by the
strains of "My Country Tis of Thee,"
constituted Milwaukee's reply this
afternoon to President Wilson's pre
paredness demands.
Eight thousand other dwellers in
this, the "hyphen country," home
of vast umbers of German-Americans,
struggled to get into the audi
torium, hut were forced to remain
outside in the hitter cold for want
of room.
"This is Milwaukee's answer,"
came a cry from the thousands when
the president entered the hall at
2:30. The cordiality of the greeting
plainly moved the president's emo
tions as he started his address.
"At the outset," he said, "I want
to remove any apprehension. Nothing
new .has happened, and there Is no
crisis. I have come out on this er
rand because everywhere the atmos
phere of the world is thrilling' with
the passion of a disturbance such as
the world never has seen before.
Hence we should set our house In
order."
The danger from hyphenated
Americanism the president declared
to be a thing of the past, adding that
"when the time comes, every man's
heart will be first for America." ,
"Wherever they come from, it was
the principle of affection, ambition
and hope that drew men to these
shores," he declared, "and they are
not going to forget the errand on
which they came. The. America
they have made their refuge will not
suffer by any torgetfulness on their
part
At the outset of the war it did
look as it there were division in the
nation that might lead us to errors.
But I believe that.danger has passed.
"The trouble makers have shot
their bolt. Some have been vocifer
ous; all have been irresponsible. Talk
was cheap and they did not have to
do anything. It is not the men ,who
are. doing the talking who represent
the sentiments of the nation. We can
control irresponsible talkers among
us.
