RESULTS
QUESTION OF ISSUING BONDS FOR
STREET IMPROVEMENTS WAS
DISCUSSED, BUT NO DEFINITE
ACTION TAKEN.
The mass meeting today called by
the mayor for the purpose of discuss
ing a bond issue for street improve
ments anil maintenance, was well at
tended and after a thorough discussion
of the various propositions, the matter
seems to have been left, just where it
was brought up for the time being at
least. The money of the street and
bridge fund of the city Is exhausted,
and no more work can be done on the
streets of any nature until the begin
ning; of the next, fiscal year. Two plans
were proposed, one of an issuance of
$.".0.1100 for building graveled streets,
and another to issue $7,Ono to $10,000
In bonds for paying the employes of
the city street department.
Just what the next step will be, ha a
not been announced by the mayor.
