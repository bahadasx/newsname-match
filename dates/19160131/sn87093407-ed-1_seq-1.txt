THE United States is convinced, in the main, that, a* a
result of the world war, "preparedness" has become a
national necessity.
Our popular schime of "preparedness" involves a mighty
navy as a first line of defense and an adequate and highly
trained array as a supplement
Two diverging question* ari-c a« t«» re
alizing the latter:
ONE: Shall we enlarge our present
force* of paid "regulars" until they reach
the desired number, or—
TWO: Shall we all devote a part of
our time directly to our country's ser
vice, so that eventually we have a univer
sal militia—a citizens' army?
Most Americans, who understand, declare
for the latter—the plan made famous by the
, little repnWu- oi Switzerland *»d kacurn *»,
"The Swiss System."
That the readers of The Star understand
this Swiss plan of democratic, unmilitary or
ganization. we have a«ked Charles Edward
Russell, the famous economist, writer and
war correspondent, to prepare a series of
articles explaining it
Russell has just returned from spending
several weeks in Switzerland, where he
studied this republic's democratic "militar
' ism"—which is militarism with the fangs
drawn.
"I am an enthusiastic convert to this sort
r. K. ißaafll
of preparedness," Russell writes the editor, "and it is clear to
■M that to urge America to adopt the Swiss system is the
greatest service any one can perform for his country.
"The greatest trouble we have had to confront here is the
lack of communal feeling, interest and team work. But think
of all boys, sons of rich men and poor, being accustomed from
their earliest youth to work together for common aims, side
by tide in a common sense. One generation of that would
knock us together, wouldn't it?"
Whether or not you agree with Russell, yott will wish to
