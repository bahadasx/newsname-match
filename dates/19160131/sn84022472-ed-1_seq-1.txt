direct taxation instead of bond

the proposals to bpnd for $500,

WAIT, COUNSEL
OF VAN SICKLE
ON GARY PLAN
Expert Who Investigated
Bridgeport Schools, Sug
gests Watching Trial.
TELLS ARGUMENTS
FOR AND AGAINST
Desirable in Crowded Places,
But Must Be Adapted,
Says Authority. -
Because of the wide interest that
has been aroused here, as everywhere
throughout the United States, in the
so-called Gary plan for schools, Supt.
J. H. Van Sickle of Springfield, Mass.,
the man who investigated the Bridge
port school system and made a re
port on it several years ago, has com
piled the arguments for and against
the plan.
Bridgeport is now seriously study
ing the plan and it is being used.
partly, in some of .the crowded dis
tricts here. Supt. Van Sickle says:
"When a scheme is proposed by
which existing school buildings may
accommodate two sets of pupils, it
is no wonder that wide interest is
aroused.
"Any plan that will lessen the ex
pense of housing school children
makes a strong appeal to "boards of
estimate, school boards, and the nress.
ocnooi Doarus are not wining; now-
ever, to be hurried into adopting, for
exclusive use in a siuation quite, dif
ferent from that in which it originat
ed, a plan so radically different from
the customary One without carefully
testing its applicability.
The Gary plan is advocated large
ly,, but-not -exclusively, "on the" ground
of lower cost There are those, how
ever, whose approval is based upon
the claim that by means of a longer
school day it affords to the children
wider opportunities for work, study,
and 'play; . that it distributes ' the bur
den of teaching more eveninly over
the entire teaching staff-; and that it
affords prevocational training to all
children in all of the grades Instead
of confining such work to a small
group of children in the seventh and
eighth grades.
The Gary system has commended
itself to students of education for
various reasons. It promises:
1 -An enriched school life for every
pUpil.
2 A co-ordination of all existing
child-welfare agencies and a fulled
utilization of! all facilities in present
public and private recreational and
educational institutions.'
3 A solution ' of the part-time
problem.
A double school plan by which
each school seat serves two children.
B- A wider use of the school plant.
6 An increase in thle school day
through a co-ordination of work,
study and play activities. ' ;
7 -A program that would invest the
child's non-academic time to greater
profit and pleasure.
8 A socialized education in har
mony withprogressive thought of the
day. : , ..
"On the .other hand, those who op
pose the immediate and wholesale
adoption of the duplicate plan for the
elimination of part-time express doubt
as to certain novel features of school
administration which it embodies,
such as departmental teaching for all
children from the first year through
the eighth, , instruction " of groups of
children by 'pupils instead of teachers,
the grouping together of younger and
older pupils for auditorium period for

Lieutenant' Merritt Honored
By National Militiamen's
Association. x
As a result of the great prepared
ness movement that is being given im
petus by President Wilson, Bridgeport
soon may have an aviation school for
Connecticut militiamen.
Three licensed aviators have offered
their services to officers at the local
state armory and 14 men have applied
and expressed willingness to learn the
aviation game. - Because of lack of
funds their services could not be tak
en advantage of during the .last few
months, but now, with the prepared
ness spirit in the air, there is no doubt,
according to militia officers that aerial
training will be instituted in Bridge-
It is already assured that several
hydroaeroplanes will be furnished
Bridgeport militiamen by the govern
ment, in line with the policy of gen
eral entrenchment. With capital that is
expected to be volunteered before long.
this city is likely to have a complete
training school for airmen. .
Not long ago, Emerson MacMillan,
a wealthy man, offered to give 10 per
cent, in addition to any fund raised for
the i establishment of aviation schools
for the various state militias. tThe
offef-"-expires today. . ' No advantage
was taken of it In Bridgeport, although
a Danbury man offered to finance such
a school, and the opportunity will be
lost. Commander Eben Hill didn't ap
prove of it.
Discussion of the offer was held
several months ago. but now, wltn
preparedness the watchword, it is cer
tain, according- to observers of nation
al affairs, that the government will
encourage financially all uch aspira
tionns.j As a result, the three licensed
aviators, in Bridgeport -who have of
fered their, services and the applicants
will probably form the nucleus for a
new department.
Discussion ' of this among otner
things, was. held at the annual conven
tion of the i Naval Militia Association
of the United States and the confer
ence of militia officers with the Navy
Department officials. The conventiori
was held Friday and Saturday at, the
New Willard hotel, Washington,, and a
banquet followed, Saturday evening.
Connecticut and Bridgeport were
honored at the convention. Lieut. Al

val militia, was elected secretary of

WILSON BOOM
FOR GOVERNOR
ON DEATH BED
While G.O.P. Leaders Feast,
Mayors Support Dies of
1 ' Mal-Nutritiori.
Mayor Clifford B. Wilson's boom for
the Republican nomination for gover
nor is dying from frost-bite.
It was -chilled to inactivity at the
annual McKinley Day banquet in New
Haven Saturday evening. Chances of
its being revived are slim, in view ..of
the frosty reception it got at the hands
of Republicans from all parts of the
state. ,
Bridgeport boomers drew a consola
tion prize, however, in copping all of
the offices of the association. - John T.
King is the new president; J. : A. H.
Robinson is secretary; and William E.
Seeley is treasurer.
"Alec" Robinson, who was the chief
talker- in behalf, of the Wilson boom
let, didn't get the' slightest bit of en
couragement from the politicians who
crowded the Hotel Taft lobby. They
admitted all of "Alec's" claims thac
Mayor Wilson is a fine sort of a chap,
but when the talk switched to the
mayor's chances of being candidate for
governor well, that was something
else again. TheseN politicians pointed
out to "Alee" that Mr. Wilson, run
ning for lieutenant governor, was way
behind the head of his ticket in his
home town.
Labor Commissioner William E.
Hyde was , busy booming Speaker
Frank E. Healy, of Windsor Locks,
for governor, and the Healy boomlet
seemed to be quite lusty. Mr. Hyde
had an- able lieutenant in Fred Gay
lord, of Ansonia, who boosted Healy
stock whenever he got a chance.

boosters for Comptroller Morris C
Webster and W. Scott Eames was very
busy talking in behalf of Denis A.

of the martyred president, was the.
chief speaker.

Navy department officials had received no word of the

In addition to the Steeret and Perkins, the destroyers Wor-j

that no further word from the missing vessel had been received i
by him early today. -

Milwaukee, Wis., Jan. 31 President

train at 12:16.' This afternoon he will
deliver an address in behalf of na

of the most important of his present
trip. Whileno authoritative hint was
given,' it was reported that his address
will be a straight-f rom-the-shoulder
talk on "America First.''
The trip from Cleveland was made
without ' incident. ' ' The President
alighted from his car for a few min
utes' exercise at the .LaSalle street
station in Chicago. He was accom
panied by several guards as he paced
the station platform.
President Wilson has not changed
his stand on the question of the right
of, Americans to travel oh merchant
ships lof belliegerent nations. The
statement that the President now fa
vored the passage of a bill barring
American citizens from such vessels
which was published today was denied
by Secretary Tumulty.

he always stood on that question," said
Mr. Tumulty. .
BRANDEIS' NAME
IS REFERRED TO
SUB-COMMITTEE
Washington, Jan. 31. The nomina
tion of Louis D. Brandeis, of Boston,
for the supreme court bench, was re
ferred; for investigation by the Senate
Juriciary comniittee today, to a sub
committee consisting of Senators Chil
ton, Walsh, Fletcher (Democrat) and
Cummin and Clark (Republicans).
Navy officials were not alarmed by ;
the absence of any report from the I
submarine. They believed she may
have experienced trouble with her en
gines but said-- her battery power was
sufficient to keep her under control in
that case. ' The possibility that the K-5 '
might have been run down by a steam
er or schooner in the fog was dis
cussed among officials which though
Jsuch a collision would have been re
ported before this by the larger ves
sel,. - . -
AH the boats 'of the K class, offi
cials, said, have thoroughly demon
strated themselves .to . be seaworthy
and efficient. Thoie on the Atlantic
coast went to Key West from New
Tork without difficulty last winter for
maneuvers and "were making the same
trip when the K-5 disappeared Sun
day. The K boats in the Pacific re
cently went "from San Francisco to
Honolulu under their own power es
tablishing a new record for long dis
tance cruising for American subma-
rines. r -
The K-5 was equipped with wire
less having a sending radium of 50
miles . Navy department officials said
it was probable that the vessels had ;
gotten beyond reach of its wireless or -that
the apparatus had been damaged
so that it could not report the craft's
location, it was pointed out hat the
vessels sent out in search for the K-5
might easily reach it by wireless if it
were afloat but that submarine would
be unable to - acknowledge any mes
sage beyond a "distance of 50 miles.
NO RESPONSE TO WIRELESS.

vessels continue to search the Carolina
coast early today for the United States

marine men to express fears that the

to her wireless apparatus. The monitor'
Tallahassee and three submarines of
the K type arrived off the Charleston
