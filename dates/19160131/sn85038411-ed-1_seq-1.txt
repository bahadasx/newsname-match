Sister Vessels With Monitor

Harbor After Being Held!
Up by Dense Fog
By .Associated Press
Charleston, S. C., Jan. 31.—Naval
\essels continued to search the Caro
lina coast early to-day for the United
States submarine K-5, reported miss
ing since 1 o'clock Sunday morning,
but according to information available
here their efforts had been futile. The 1
•
submersible had not responded to
wireless calls sent out from shore sta
tions and naval vessels and this led
marine men to express fears that the
boat had suffered at least an accident
to her wireless apparatus. A heavy
fog hung over the coast between here
and Cape Romain, forty miles north of
here, where the K-5 last was sighted,
and this made more difficult the task
of the searchers.
The K-5. with three other sub
marines of the same type—the K-l,
K-2 and K-6—convoyed by the sub
marine tender Tallahassee, left New
York January 17 for Key West, Fla.,
for maneuvers In southern waters. The
Tallahassee and the other three sub
marines arrived off Charleston bar last
night, but were prevented from enter
ing the harbor by the fog.
Flotilla Reaches Port
' Arrival of the flotilla and its convoy
was followed by the Tallahassee's wire
less report to Washington naval ofh- ;
cials that the K-5 was missing. Shortly
after that naval boats in these waters,
including the destroyer Worden, the
• oast guard cutters Yamacraw and
Seminole and the buoy tender Man
grove, were ordered to begin search.
No word had been received up to 9
a. m. to-day from the submarine K-5
or from the vessels which are search
ing for her, according to the navy yard
officials.
The monitor Tallahassee and the
submarines K-l, K-2 and K-6 came j
into the Charleston harbor at 9.30 ,
o'clock this morning. They were held
outside all night because of the dense |
fog. ' I
Officer." of the Tallahassee were
credited with 'he statement that noth- |
ing had been heard of the K-5. This |
would indicate that the wireless appa- |
rntus of the missing submarine was i
out of order, us the Tallahassee and |
the coast guard cutters have used their I
wireless extensively in an effort to find j
the little vessel.

MIGHT HAVE BEEN
RUN DOWN BY SHIP
Navy Officials Believe That
Her Wireless or Engines
; Have Been Disabled; Still
Has Strong Batteries
By Associated Press
Washington. Jan. 31.—A1l efforts of
the Navy wireless and a flotilla of coast
guardshlps and war vessels to locate
the missing submarine K-5 had been
n.e flotilla and mother ship Talla
hassee. which put in at Charleston, S.
C., and gone on alone to the submar
ine base at Key West, Fla.
Navy officials were not alarmed by
the absence of any report from the
submarine. . They believe she may
have experienced trouble with her en
gines but said her battery power was
sufficient to keep her under control in
that case. Failure to receive any re
port from the vessel, they said, might
indicate that her wireless apparatus
has become deranged. The possibility
that the K-5 might have been run
down by a steamer or schooner in the
fog was discus ed among officials who
thought such a collision would have
been reported before this by the larger
vessel.
Secretary Daniels ordered the de
stroyers Sterret and Perkins enroute
from Pensacola to Charleston to search
for the missing submarine. The de
stroyer Worden at Charleston, the
coast guard cutters Seminole and Ya
macraw and the buoy tender Mangrove
also are cruising for her.
Lieut. R. C. Grady commands the
K-5 with Ensign H. C. Fraser second
in command.

AMERICA FIRST,
PLEA OF WILSON
TO FOREIGN BORN
Most Important Address of I lis
Tour For Preparedness at
Milwaukee
SPEAKS FROM THE CAR;
i
Delivers Talks in Three Small
Towns; Rack to Chicago
Tonight
By Associated Press
Chicago, 111., Jan. 3T. President
Wilson passed through Chicago early
to-day enroute for Milwaukee where
he delivered an address which some
of Ills party believe was one of the
most important of his tour of the Mid
dle West to advocate the speedy up
building of an adequate national de
fense.
. His special left Cleveland at mid
night and arrived in Milwaukee at
noon to-day.
The trip from Chicago, where the
President did net leave his car, to
Milwaukee was broken by the first of
several brief addresses by the Presi
dent from the rear platform of hlsi
private car. Three such addresses
were at Waukegan, 111., Kenosha, Wis,. I
and Racine, Wis.
During the ride from Chicago to
Waukegan the President devoted most I
of the time to correspondence and |
preparing material for his Milwaukee 1
address. Because of the large for
eign-born population 'of the city, it
was thought he would touch on the
duties of naturalized Americans In
their adopted country in connection
with the preparedness policy.
President Wilson expects to leave
Milwaukee soon after his address is
ended. His train is due to reach Chi
cago at 6 p. m. to-night, two hours
before he is to address an audience at
the auditorium here.
The train to which was attached
the special cars bearing President
Wilson and his party, reached Chicago
at 8:15 a. m. The run from Cleve
land was accomplished without inci
dent.
Crowds Gather
President. Wilson was up early this
morning and was eating breakfast
with Mrs. Wilson when his train pass
ed through the La Salle street station.
Several thousand people were gath
i ered at both the La Salle station and
■&oc&hweet«ri) stations in the hope of
catching a glimpse of him.
A few minutes after Mr. Wilson ar
rived at the Northwestern Station he
alighted from his private car and
walked up and down the platform ac
companied by a guard of secret serv
ice men. He remarked on the fresh
ness of the air.
President Wilson has not changed
his stand on the question of the right
of Americans to travel on merchant
ships of belligerent nations. The
statement that the President now
favored the passage of a bill barring
American citizens from such vessels,
which was published to-day, was de
nied by Secretary Tumulty.
"The President stands to-day just
where he always stood on that ques
tion," said Mr. Tumulty.
Raps Quihblcrs
Milwaukee, Wis., Jan. 31. Presi
dent Wilson threw down the gauntlet
to-day to opponents of national pre
paredness who have declared that the
movement sprang from the desires of
munitions and armament manufac
turers to make money.
"I for my part have all along advo
cated and always shall advocate that
j the government as far as possible shall
I manufacture these things for itself, in
order that at any rate it may control
the prices at which these articles will
be sold to the government. If it is
necessary to protect ourselves against
those who would make money out of
(the necessities of the nation, there are
adequate means of defending our
selves and we will use these means.
But I dont believe the impulse comes
from those quarters. I don't believe
that in those quarters there is patriot
ism lacking anymore than there is
patriotism laraklng in other quarters."
The President's declaration was de
livered from the rear platform of
his private car at Racine, Wis., half
an hour before he reached this city.
New Circumstances Have
Made It Necessary For U. S.
. to Arm, Wilson Declares
Specitl to the Telegraph
Cleveland, 0., Jan. 31.—New cir
cumstances have arisen. President
Wilson declared Saturday night which
make it absolutely necessary that this
country should prepare for adequate
national defense.
"I should feel that T was guilty of
an unpardonable omission," he'de
! clared, "If I did not go out and tell
I my fellow countrymen that new clr
j cumstances have arisen which make
| it absolutely necessary that this couri-
J try prepare herself, not for war, not
for anything that smacks in the least
of aggression, but for adequate na
tional defense."
America's Improvident neglect to
build merchant ships, the President
said, in explanation, had left the
country dependent upon other nations
] to carry its commerce, nations now at
war, all friends of America, but pre
occuple-d, stubbornly steadfast in the
maintenance of their main purpose.
"Wherever the ordinary rule 3 of
commerce at sea and of International
relationship arc apt to be thrust aside
or Ignored," he continued, "there is
danger of the more critical k.nd of
controversy."
The necessity for quick action was
made the keynote of the President's

and Cleveiutid on the li:st day of a

PRETTY WIFE WORKED
End of Story of 22 Years Also

L. Guy Klinger. Millersburg, has
never been a very good husband; he's
always been "too tired."
So a next door neighbor told Ad

in January divorce court to-day when
pretty "*rs. Teenie Klingcr asked the
law to untie the marital knot.
Up until the Klingers' -wedding day
June 1, 1912 KUnger's work-a-day In
dustry had never been in Question al
though, as one witness put It, he'd
never been exactly noted for hustling.
His bride had a pretty good job In the
shoe factory at the time: so did Kling
er. The echo of the wedding bells
hadn't died away before Klinger set
tled down to loaf.
"He quit his job and hasn't done
much since but liquor up in the bar
rooms when he could get a little
money together; other times he just
laid around on the grass in the
shade," a witness said.
He's "Too Tired"
And Mrs. Klinger retained her old
job and worked away to keep the
house of Klinger together. January
14, 1914, Klinger took his wife to visit
his folks at Dalmatia. Mrs. Klinger
returned one Sunday evening; to this
day Klinger has never returned. And
an indignant neighbor, a bosom friend
of Mrs. Klinger expressed her opinion
of the wayward husband very forcibly
when Attorney Robert Stucker asked
her what "kind of a husband Klinger
made."
"Not very good he's too tired!"
briefly explained the witness.

By Associated rress '
Paris, Jan. 31. —Several bombs were
dropped by a Zeppelin which flew over
the outskirts of Paris last night, but
they produced no such deadly effect
as on the occasion of the raid of
Saturday.
The official press bureau gave out
the following statement this morning:
"A German dirigible set out in the
direction of Paris, where it arrived
soon after 10 p. m. It was bombarded
by our special batteries and attacked
by our aeroplanes. Before returning
northward it dropped a number of
bombs, which, according to the news
received so far, did no damage."
Representatives of the Matin who
visited the scene of the raid said no
damage was done by the bombs.
Three of them fell on a piece of waste
ground and three others in a field. A
police inspector saw the three which
fell in the field. They did not sink
deep in the soil. They were covered
with a cotton-like substance which
burst into flame. The inspector char
