Rexford L. Holmes and' Miss
Annie Black Back From Ford
Expeditio.
BOTH SADDER BUT WISER
They Belie in Big Armies and
- Plenty' of War If Nuts 'Are
In Trenches.
Itexford I Holmes, of this city,-went
to Europe with the Ford peace party,
confident In the belief that the war In
Europe was all that Sherman .said
nbout It, and that the Detroit automo
bile manufacturer had divine Inspira
tion for his plan to "Ret the boys out
of the trenches by Christmas."
Miss -Annie O. Black, one of Mr.
Holmes' corps of Washington stenog
raphers, went to Europo believing that
woman's place was to assist In bringing
nbout peace at any price,, and that she
was going to have the best time of her
young life.
Ooth Mr. Holmes and Miss Black
hayn returned to Washington, sadder
and wiser.
bays Mr. Holmes: "I believe In big
armaments. I believe that many of the
paclHolsta are crazy. I want to soe a
big army In" this country, and tons and
tons of ammunition ready."
Says Miss Black: "I believe In war.
That in to say. If there was any chance
of getting the peace nuts In the
trenches, which thero Is not."
Preparing a Statement.
Mr. Holmes and his pretty stenog
rapher were hard at work today pre
paring a statement to the public about
their grievances. Mr. Holmes, who la
of youngish appearances and strokes his
blonde hair a lot, was doing the dic
tating. Miss Black, who has pretty
black eyes, .wus pounding the type
writer. The telephone receiver had been
taken ofT tho Jiook that the train of
thought might not bo Interrupted. Jt
jfeHn,tr.-ftsDiiently -however, ,for Mr.
Holmes would change and correct as he
went along, and Miss Black would say
"dog-gone-lt," which, she says, Is the
mildest expression she heard at any of
the peace meetings, either on board the
good fchlp Oscar JI. on which the party
f-alled to Europe, or after tho party
landed
Mr. Holmes was particularly Interest-,
fd in rpftitlng charges which, ho said,
had been mado against him by Mmo.

the expedition, that he. Holmes, had
tried to steal $5,000. Miss Black was
more interested In describing Mrs.

Pranks of Elements Set New
Records for High and Low
Temperatures.
The month of January. 191. which
'"'ns to s close today, will go down In
fttorv as one of the most rem nrkable
months, so far as pranks of tr-e ele

Bureau was estab'lshed. While people

have hf-aid frogs croaking nnd birds
warbling their mating songs. In other
sections of the United States both high
anr low temperature records for Janu
ary have been smashed, while Califor
nia and the Mississippi vallev region
are today suffering from Hoods.
While sections In the Eastern part of
the country were breaking high records,
those In the West were recording the
lowept In history. On January , when
the unusual figure of St degrees below

mercury climbed up into the region of
summer temperatures In army sections
of tho East, breaking high records In
Hartford. -Tonn. Scmnton. Pa.: Harris

Hty. On Januurv 12. when all celd
records for Rapid Cltv, s. n.. and
Devils, were broken with temperatures
ranging from 32 to 42 below, people at
Meridian. Miss., were sweltering In the
warmest January weather in the his

The fact that Washington ha several
days of tho coldest weather of the win

somewhat deceptive, but in no nolnt of

present January has been a rocord
breaker. Despite the cold spells, ) ow
ever. the average mean temperature for
the month Is 39.7 degrees, as compared
With u normal for Januarv of 3J.0.

providing for a "drv" District of Colum
bia after November 1 one .of the most
thorough, comprehensive and drastlo
measures ever written on the subject
of llauor.
The bill not only prohibits the manu
facture, sale, and giving away of alco
holic beverages, but It provides that
mere possession of llauor shall be
deemed sufficient evidence to convict a
person of selling It. Ownership of a
license such as wholesale druggists

denatured and pure grain alcohol woutd
be a violation of the law by anyone
other than a wholesale druggist.
Express companies and other common
canicrs nre prohibited under penalty
from delivering alcoholic beverages to '
firms, clubs or Individuals. No liquor
advertisements, under the terms of the I
bill, could be displayed on billboards In I
newspapers or anywhere else. The I
"locker system" at clubs Is specifically
forbidden and any scheme or device to
evade the provisions of the bill shall be
regarded vlust tho same as the sale of
liquor.
Payment Would Convict.
Evidence that a person had paid for
liquor would be sufficient to convict
under tho Shepard bill. The kind of
alcohol beverage kept or sold need not
be specified In a warrant for the
arrest of a person for violating the law.
The. bill provides for the searching of
suspected places for liquor upon com
plaint of any person, and also stipu

to restrain the seller or keeper ot liquor
as a common nuisance.
Any owner of property, upon being
notilled in writing that liquor was be

CASE OF BRANDEIS
Senators Chilton, Fletcher,
Walsh, Clark, and Cummins
Named as Board.
At the meeting of the Senate Judlc
lary Committee today, the nomination
of IxjuIs D. Brandels was referred to
a subcommittee by Acting Chairman
Overman.
This action was taken without dis
cussion. The subcommittee consists ot
Senators Chilton, Fletcher and Walsh,
Democrats, and Clark of Wyoming and
Cummins, Republicans.
Tha personnel of the subcommittee is
considered such as to Insure the nomi
nation fair treatment, and probably a
favorable report to tho main commit
tee. Senator Chilton, chairman of the sub
committee, and Senator Fletcher arc
for Brandels. Senator Walsh Is ex
pectedxto lino up for him unless sub
stantial charges should be sustained
against him. Scnatdr Cummins has not
committed himself. Senator Clark Is
opposed to him.
Senator Overman, It had been report
ed, would fltack tho subcommittee
against Brandels. But ho did not do
so. His position was that a fair sub
committee of good lawyers should be
named, and the caso passed on Judi
cially. Senator Chilton, chairman of the sub
committee, 6ald he would call a meet
ing In a short time, but did not know
Just when. Ho la anxious to expedite
the matter. Ho said any person that
had anytnlng material to present would
be. given in opportunity.
Today's developments In the Judiciary
Committee have not changed the boiler
that tho probabilities favor an adverse
report from the Judiciary Committee It
self, oven If the subcommittee Is fa
vorable, and that tho real contest will
bo fought out In the Senate.
Another fact which has become quite
plain is that the temper of the bar as
bociationx of tho country will have
weight with Senators.

To Correct Eils.
"hTe purpose of the Investigation." he
said "Is to examine Into the facts, and
If It Is found that evils exist to correct
these evils.

raolcallv wrong And 1 am seeking to

real farts arc.
"It la claimed that the dissolution
of the Standard Oil Company by the
courts has not prevented the several
companies formed and organized since
that time from controlling the oil and
gasolene business of tho country. As
to this. I do not know. I do know,
however, that the public Is forced to
pay enormous Increased prices for
gasolene, and the public 1b entitled
to know tho reason why.
"It seems to mo It Is tho duty of
Congress to uso the power at its
hands to disclose these facts, and if
these faotH reveal that existing laws
are being violated by tho producers
of gasolene, then tho Department of
Justice should vlgorodsly proceed to
prosecute any violations of the law.
Square Deal Wanted.
"I believe the sure way to arrive at
a proper conclusion of this matter la
that a committee of the House be ap
pointed clothed with full authority to
go to the bottom of this question.
"If the Investigation discloses that the
price of gasolene is being fixed and
controlled by producers in a manner
unreasonable and exorbitant, but not In
violation of any present law, Congress
should then proceed to the enactment
of such legislation as will correct such
conditions.
"Uasoleno has become a very neces

public is entitled to a 'square deal."
The people have the right to know the
facts. My resolution properly enforced
will dlscloflo tho facts."

Only Official News Comes From
Tender Tallahassee,Who Re
' ported Disappearance.
Gravest fears that the subma
rine K-5 and its crew of two com
missioned officers and twenty-six
men are at the bottom of the sea
were held by Navy Department
officials today, when thirty-six
hours passed after the U-boat was
reported missing off Charleston,
S. C, without news.
Wireless instructions were
flashed this morning from the Navy
I Department -to vessels along tho
Miianuc ioasi to jojn hi mc searcu
for the missing submarine.
Although the search is hamper
ed by a dense fog, Secretary
Daniels has not given up hope that
the submarine will turn up safely.
ONLY OFFICIAL NEWS.
The only official news received by
the Navy Department toda came from
the tender Tallahassee, which was ac
companying the K-l, K-2, K-5, and K.-8.
to winter maneuver grounds off Key!
est. The Tallahassee reported that
It was In communication with the K-Ei
at 1 o'clock Sunday morning, nfty mllea
north of Charleston. When the tender
and the three other boats of the sub
marine notllla reached Charleston, tha
K-j was missing.
The Na Department was not noti
lled until a fruitless ctfort wns madej
to commcnicutc with the K-i by wire
less. The K-5 was commanded b. Lloutj
ftonan C. Urady. ulfo vns appointed!
to the Naval Academy from .Mat-aachu-setts
in WC nnd wns graduated In IWS.
Tho only other commissioned officer
detailed to the ship was Lieut- (Junior
grade) Hugh C. Frazer,' who was ap
pointed to the Academy from est lv-1
glnla in 1908 nnd was graduated In 1912.
One cause for fear is that the K-5
carried wireless and would be able to
send out a call for help If afloat, un
less there was a machinery breakdown
which placed the wireless out of com
mission. The radius of its wireless,
however, was less tluin 100 miles, and
officials said heavy fog conditions might
cut this down to tlftcn or twenty-flve)
miles.
