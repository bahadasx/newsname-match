BLOCKADE RIGHT

French Fleet Will Hereafter Assist
in Patrolling Channel and

HOTH AtTTES TO ACT AS OTTF.
LONDON, Jan. 26. Sir Edward
Grey said the country could not
abandon its right of interference
with 'enemy trade and could not ex
ercise the right without consider
able interference with neutral trade.
If neutrals held the country was not
entitled to exercise the right It
would be a "departure from neu
trality." Neutrals must admit or not
Britain's right to apply principles
used by the American government
in the civil war.
The foreign secretary concluded
by declaring: "We shall see this
thing through to the end."
Hereafter French warships will
assist British vessels in blockade
duties in both the English channel
and the North Sea, participating in
the examination of the mall and
cargo.
In the future France will be con
sulted on ail questions concerning
the blockade. Joint Anglo-French re
lies will be made to any protests
on the subject.
LONDON, Jan. Z8- The opening phrase
of the speeches of Sir Edward Grey, for
eign secretary In the House of Commons,
and of the marquise of Lansdowne. min
ister without portfolio, in the House of
Lord, today nave the impression that
the British government la not likely to
resort to an absolute blockade of Ger
many.
Experts and self-styled experts on the
economies of war and the law or marl'
time war on commerce, mobilised In the
House of Commons this afternoon for
the eagerly awaited debate on the meas
ures to be taken for a blockade against
Germany.
Critics of the government policy and the
dofawdere thereof were equally Insistent
upoa the necessity of enforcing "a block-
nde as effective as possible." but they
" Joined Issue on the best method of en--i
forcing this, a keen desire being shown
in some quarters to make the interfer
ence with neutral commerce as light as
possible. . " . - 1
The demand was general, however, for
a greater stringency in the prevention of
foodstuffs and. other conditional contra
band passing by neutral countries Into
Germany.
The debate hinged on a motion intro
duced with the object of obtaining from
the government a tull statement of the
racis tna ginns an uijii luuuj v
with most of the aspects of the recent
complaints against the foreign office.
The motion follows:
That this house, having noted the vol
ume of Imports Into neutral countries
bordering on enemy territory, of goods
essential to the enemy for the prosecu
tion of the war, urges the government to
enforce as effective a blockade as possi
ble without interfering with the normal
requirements of those neutral countries
for internal consumption.
Arthur Shirley Bonn, unionist member
for Plymouth, on introducing the motion
for an effective blockade, urged the gov
eminent, in conduction with the entente
allies to declare that the entire over
ooeanlo trafflo with Germany shall be
prevented by a blockade. He said ha
did not thtnk America would object aa
the blockade) would be on the same princi
ple as was the blockade declared by Lin

HEAD WILL
HOT ENTER RACE
Governor Announces Definitely that
He Cannot Become Candidate
for Re-election.
MAY GO TO BRYAN BY DEFAULT
(From a Staff Correspondent.)
LINCOLN, Jan. 26. (Special.)
Gloom deep -louds of gloom
hung over the state house today, so
dark and dreary that even the storm
clouds appear like bright spots in
the political canopy above. This is all
caused by the announcement by
Governor Morehead that he would
not under any circumstances be a
candidate for governor for a third
nomination at the hands of the dem
ocratic party, or accept the petitions
now appearing at the office of the
secretary of state asking that his
name be placed on the primary bal
lot. To newspapermen who called at the
executive offtoe after the governor had
returned from Omaha, he said that he
could not see bis way clear to accept the
filings and would not be a candidate for
the governorship.
How about the nomination for the
United States senatef asked a reporter.
f oaalderlnsr feaatorshlp.
The governor took a sldewlse glance at
the representative of an Omaha demo
cratic paper, who was in the group, and
then, with a twinkle In one eye, winked
the other at a couple of others, and said:
I am considering that matter now."
"Oh, governor," solemnly and beseech
ingly put in the Omaha reporter, "your
announcement that you would not be a
candidate for governor has taken the Joy
all out of life; don't make it any worse."
The governor smiled and with" a wink at
the other fellows, announced that tomor
row he would make a written statement
of his position, but did not care to say
very much today.
Democratic cohorts seem to believe now
there is nothing to It but the nomination
for Mayor Charles Brysn, or to let the
place go by default. '
One heartless democrat promptly said
when the matter was mentioned that the
place might go by default or Mayor
Bryan fill It, "Well, it would be all the
same anyway, so what's the use."
Let Semeoae Else Do It.
Governor Morehead says that he ia.no
refusing to become a candidate from any
fear of the outcome, but simply that he
does not believe that he should be ex
pected to lead tho party again, but that
there are others who could Just as suc
cessfully do so. He thinks that there is
a good chance for democratic success, but
that some other democrat than himself
should "hop to It." '
When told by a Bee representative that
Governor Morehead had announced that
be would not run for a third term Mayor
Charles "W. . Bryan .appeared pleased.
This Is the first I had heard of It," he
Said. When asked about the petitions be
ing circulated in his behalf and which,
yesterday he had denied knowledge of, he
said that they were being signed up
merely as a testimonial of the signers'
confidence in him, but that he had not
yet fully decided what he would do when
the petitions of confidence were filed.
Orraa Has Not Decided.
"I recognise that the democratio party
this year needs a man at the head of the
ticket," said the mayor, "who will take a
firm stand on the, question of the liquor
business, but whether I will be the man
I do not yet know."
The mayor did not seem at all dlseon
solate over the announcement of the gov-
ernor and it may be considered a pretty
safe bet that when the "petitions of con
fldence" are filed that the mayor will not
take any chance that the time limit for
accepting the same win expire, but will
show a great deal of confidence in him
self by accepting.

WILSON SEES HOPE
FOR SHIPPING BILL
Insurgent Congressman Likely to
Come Back on Reservation
and Vote for It.
HE TALKS WITH SOME OF THEM
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26. Pros
pects for passage of a government
ship purchase bill are believed to be
bright by adniiniHtratlon leaders,
who saw In the conference President
Wilson had today with democrats
who opposed such a measure last
year indications that united support
for th,e revised proposal eventually
would be won.
The president continued during
the day to urge leading members of
congress to hasten action on import
ant legislation. He discussed the
ship bill particularly with Majority
Leader Kitchln of the house and
Senator Clarke of Arkansas. Later
-Representative Kitchln said the. bill,
if presented as outlined to him,
would receive his support. Senator
Clarke would not discuss it, but
some of his friends said they be-
I lleved the measure could be sub
niitted In form to meet his approval.
Matters to Be Poshed.
Senator Simmons, chairman of the sen
ate finance committee, and Representa
tive Fltsgerald, chairman of the house
appropriations committee, were among
those who went to the White House for
conferences. The president made it clear
that matters before congress he hoped to
see pushed ahead of everything else were
the following:
National defense measures, Including
army reorganisation and Increased naval
construction.
Creation of a merchant marine deafened
to serve as a naval auxiliary In time of
war.
Revenue legislation, Including revision
of the Income tax law and creation of a
non-partisan tariff board.
The Philippine self-government bill,
which will Include a provision granting
independence within two to four yeans,
provided satisfactory steps are taken In
the meantime to establish a stable, Inde
pendent government.
Conservation bills for development of
water, power, and mineral bearing lands.
Calls oa Clarke.
Among other democratic senators who
fought the shipping bill last year and who
have discussed It recently with the pres
ident are Senators Hardwlck, Hitchcock,
O'Gorman and Vardaman. H became
known today that one evening last week
Mr. Wilson surprised a congressional
party of men and women by appearing
unannounced at Senator Clarke's hotel,
where ho conferred for an hour and a
half with the Arkansas senator In a cor
ner of the hotel parlor.
The opposition senators have expressed
satisfaction over some of the features of
the new bill, but are inclined stlU to op
pose anything that mlaht make govern
ment operation of ships probable. As
now proposed, the Mil would provide for
government operation in case satisfactory
leases to private corporations could not
be made.

SEXTON'S RESOLUTION IS PASSED
BCLLETIN.
BRISTOL, England, Jan. 26. The
British Labor conference adopted to
day by a vote of 1,847,000 agalnBt
206,000, a resolution entirely approv
ing the action of the Parliamentary
libor party in co-operating with other
political parties In tbe national re
cruiting campaign.
BRISTOL, Eugland, Jan. 26. The
representatives of more than 2,000,
000 members of trades unions met. ,
here today to decide the attitude of
organised labor toward the war and,
lc particular, compulsory milltarj .
service.
Early In the proceedings an attack
on the compulsory service bill now
before the House of Lords was made
bj the president of the conference,
William Anderson, member of Par
liament for the Attercllffe division
of Sheffield. Mr. Anderson, who bald
opposed the bill In Parliament, de
clared that it did not redeem the
pledge of Premier Asqulth regarding
compulsion.
Fear, Force lartastrlal Bereie.
"No form of words can offer Immunity
from danger." said he. "We cannot have
military service without the risk of
forced Industrial service. Any attempt to
use this weapon to coerce tradea union
ists will lead to great bitterness and end
In failure."
Mr. Anderson said there was danger In
Great Britain attempting the Impossible,
by seeking to be almlltaneouaty a great
military, a great ''naval and a great In-'
dustrlsl power. He said the world would
be different after the war, adding:
"It will be a hard and a bad world for '
labor unless labor takes a hand in shap- .
Ing It." ' -t
Sexton Resolattoa Passed.
The first resolution was tneveri . by
James SextonV on behalf of tbe National
Union of Dock Workers. The resolution
expresses "the horror of .the confarenoe
at the attrocltles committed by Germany
and its allies", and pledges the conference
to assist the government as far as pos
sible to prosecute the war successfully, .
Mr. Sexton said he was opposed to mil
itarism, but that the war must be won.
"If Germany wins." ha- continued,
"nothing else on God's earth matters."
Ilainsay MaoDonald, labor member of
parliament, appealed for toleration. He
deprecated such a controversial resolu
tion which, be said, was calculated to In
terfers with labor's previous comradeship
and unity In fighting a common enemy.
