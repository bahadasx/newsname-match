who died in a hospital shortly af
ter jumping from the third floor
of an up-town hotel as that of 'a-

Other occupants of the house told

BANDIT GANG
GETS $12,000
HAUL IN BANK
Bold Daylight Robbery Per
petrated in Busy Sec
tion of Chicago.
MAKE ESCAPE IN AUTO
Hold Employes at Point of
Guns Back Out and Leap
Into Big Machine.
Chicago, Jan. 27. Four bandits,
armed with revolvers, entered the
Washington Park National bank in
East 63rd street today and escaped
with between $12,000 and $15,000 after
threatening the lives of clerks, cash
iers and 20 depositors.
None of the depositors, who were
ordered to stand facing a wall was
searched by the bandits who gave their
sole attention to the money in the tel
ler's cage.
After grabbing the money the four
hastily backed to the door and escaped
in an automobile.
J. Garland Stahl, manager of the
Boston Americans when that club won
the world's championship in 1912, is
vice president of the bank. Stahl be
gan his baseball career in 1903 when
he signed with the Boston club after
graduating from the University of Illi
nois. Later he became manager of the
Washington Americans and then of the
Boston Americans.
Was Carefully Planned.
Every detail of the robbery seemed
carefully planned, according to Mr.
Stahl, who was forced to remain at his
desk facing a revolver while one of the
robbers entered the teller's cage and
took the money from a drawer. "I
was sitting at my desk," said Mr.
Stahl, "shortly before 9 o'clock when
four men, their faces masked in black,
and each carrying two revolvers, en
tered. There were about ten persons
in line at the cashier's wicket, 10
clerks, the bank officers and two sten
ographers in the room.
"They did not molest the depositors
and as soon as the money was in their
possession, backed to the door and to
their automobile.
"The engine of the car had not been
stopped and they went down the street
at about forty miles an hour.
"They got more than twelve thou
sand dollars."
Paid Attention to StahL
Municipal Judge Sheridan E. Fry
was among the depositors who was
forced to witness the robbery.
The bandits paid special attention
to Mr. Stahl, who was singled out by
one of the men. Two revolvers were
poked within an inch of his face and
he was ordered to hold up his hands.
The same command was given to all
the others in the bank and not a hand
was dropped until the last robber
backed out of the door.
Pedestrians reported that while the
robbery was in progress a fifth man
was at the wheel of the automobile.
Officials of the bank said that none
of the robbers appeared to be more
than 20 years old.
The bank is situated in one of the
busiest sections of Chicago outside of
the downtown district.
BEATEN MAN SAYS
MONTENEGRO KING
Paris, Jan. 27, (5:20 a. m.) "My
presence and that of my family and my
government here," said King Nicholas
of Montenegro to a special corres
pondent of the Journal in Lyons,
"shows my unbounded confidence that
France will protect me from calumny.
I do not need to make any apology. My
grandson, Prince Humbert, crown
prince of Italy, when I saw him in
Rome the other day, asked me why I
was Bad. I replied, 'Your grandfather
is a beaten man.1 The child then ask
ed: 'You had nothing to eat in your
country?' Thus my 11-year-old grand
son summed up the causes of our de
feat better than the diplomatists and
the chancellors have done."
GERMANY EXPELS

Berlin, (via London), Jan. 27, (11:05

'action is taken in reprisal for expui-
eion of German women who had been

Labor Votes
Against Bill
For Service
Bristol, England, Jan. 27. A resolu
tion protesting in the name of the na
tional labor party against the adop
tion of conscription in any form was
passed by the labor congress today by
a vote of 1,796,000 against 219,000.
The resolution follows:
"Resolved: That this national labor;
party protests emphatically against
the adoption of conscription in any
form, as it is against the spirit of Brit
ish democracy and full of danger to
the liberties of the people."
When the delegates assembled to
day for the second day's session they
found this resolution on their tables,
and also one on the military service
bill, which were designed to take the
place of the numerous proposals
which have been made on these sub
jects. The other resolution placed before
the congress follows:
"This conference declares its oppo
sition to the military service bill and,
in the event of it becoming law, de
cides to agitate for its repeal."

millian Harden has arrived in Switzer
land to resume there the publication

to a dispatch from Basel to the Jour
nal. THE WAR TODAY
According to a statement made
by M. Longuet, a French socialist
deputy, at the British trade union
conference in Bristol today, the
French losses in the war have been
800,000 killed, 1,100,000 wounded
and 300,000 captured.

British possession of territory
protecting the Suez canal route at
Its southern end is imperilled by
attacks made by Arabs and Turks
on the British forces in south
western Arabia, according to ad
vices from German sources. The
British have been driven from all
territory they held In that sec
tion of country and have suffered
extremely heavy losses, the fig
ures being given at 15,000 killed
and 20,000 wounded. "
The implication from the Berlin
dispatch carrying these reports is
that the British army of more
than 20,000 men is now virtually
cooped up In Aden, near the en
trance to the Bed Sea, which must
be held if the southerly approach
to the Suez canal is to be protect
ed. The An stria ns, having possess
ion of virtually all Montenegro
according to Vienna, are pushing
southward in Albania, but appar
ently are moving deliberately, al
though encountering much resist
ance. The British house of commons
threshed out the blockade question
last night and at the close of Sir
Edward Grey's effective speech, it
was decided to adhere to the gov
ernment's existing policy. A reso
lution that the entire over ocean
traffic with Germany should be
prevented by a blockade was talk
ed out and the subject dropped. -
France will hereafter assist the
British in the blockade of the Eng

and replies to protests against
seizures will be made jointly by the
two nations.

FIRES FIRST
SHOT IN WAR
FOR DEFENSE
President Makes Addresses
in New York as Opener
to Western Tour.
TO START TOMORROW
Wilson Will Leave Capital
on Speaking Campaign
of the Middle West.
New York, Jan. 27. President Wil
son arrived here at 6 o'clock this
morning to face a program calling for
a reception by clergymen, the deliv
ery of addresses before two business
organizations, and the probability that
he would be interviewed by 200 women
seeking his approval of a suffrage
amendment to the constitution and by
a delegation of German Americans
who want him to persuade the Brit
ish government to permit the ship
ment of milk from America for
babies in Germany. The president
was accompanied by Mrs. Wilson, his
secretary, Joseph Tumulty and Dr.
Cary T. Grayson.
The main purpose of the president's
visit is to deliver before the Railway
Business association tonight the
speech which is to open his campaign
for preparedness, the first of a series
of speeches on that subject which he
will make while on a trip through the
middle west. Although only 1,272
seats are available for the dinner at
which he is to speak, more than 5,000
applications have been received.
After addressing the railway men
the president has arranged to speak
at a banquet of the motion picture
board of trade of America.
Mr. Wilson expects to leave New
York for Washington at midnight to
night and to leave the capital tomorrow
night for his western tour.
Likens Wilson to Lincoln.
The president delivered the first of
his three addresses at noon before the
clerical conference of the New York
Federation of Churcnes, representing
all denominations. Amid applause he
was introduced by the Rev. Dr. S.
Edward Young of Brooklyn, who re
marked that "no other president ever
had used universal prayer in his be
half. "Only Lincoln bore such heavy re
sponsibility," said the clergyman,
"and the America of Lincoln's time
held but one-third as many people to
pray and nearly half were arrayed
against him."
The president said that in his efforts
for peace he had represented "the
spirit" of the United States of Amer
ica, "I can find no basis for peace but
justice," he added. "The greatest force
in the world is character, and I believe
that character can be expressed by the
acts of a nation. This is expressed by
the attitude of the people. We will on
ly resent having our liberty interfered
with.
Live and Let Live.
"A further foundation of peace is
our international attitude toward each
other. We have been hospitable to all
creeds and people. The peace of Amer
ica depends on the attitude of the dif
ferent races and creeds which make
