but "Uncle Sam" wont permit.

WHAT A CLERICAL
ERROR WILL DO.
H. F. Evans a native local teacher of
this county, of forty years experience
went to Cincinnati in 18S3 and enlisted
in the united States army, from Gar
rard County Kentucky, Recruiting
Sargent made a clerical mistake of
enlisting him from "Girard, Ky."when
there was no such place In the state.
The clerical error has kept B. F. Evans
out of pension for fourteen years.
Evans has taught three hundred and
two months In this and adjoining coun
ties, iwenty-six hundred and forty
three children and three generations.
This same man is not only entitled to
the pension for the services in the
United States army, but also the Car-
nagie fund, for having taught thirty
years.
In a letter to the Hon. Harvey Helm,
from the Adjutant General's Office at
Washington, states the following fact:
"The official records show that Benj.
F. Evans enlisted November 5th, 1883.

NEW PROGRAM OF PIC
TURES AT OPERA HOUSE
No Free Show Friday Night-Date Chan
ged To February llth.
Last week the Management of the
Opera House announced that the Broken
Coin serial would begin on Jan. 28th
and that no charge would be made for
admission on that day. The Broken
Coin will not rum at the Opera House.
for since visiting the city the manage
ment has decided to start the ntw serial
"GRAFT" and it is said a much better
one, so the free show will be given on
February llth at which time the first
episode f "GRAFT" will be shown.
Following is the synopsis. Read it:
A graft syndicate exists that con
trols millions upon millions of foul-won
wealth. This syndicate holds in its
iron grip men of every type, from
every class of society. It is composed
not of the lowest element, but of the
"men higher up" men who;einteiests
represent Traction, Public Institutions,
Foodstuffs, Liquor. Railroads, Paving
and Subway Companies, Low-defying
Trusts and Corporations in short, meu
from channels of every private greed
right up to public corruption.
inis syndicate dealt In crime ever
more sinister, more threatening, thar
the crime of the l-urglar or yegg, be
cause it was a secret, subtle series of
machinations, which reared higher and
mightier man tne laws It defied, fitted
against this merciless graft syndicate
wa Dudley Larnigan, District At
torney. In his efforts to down this
powerful graft syndicate, District At
torney Larnigan loses his iife at the
hands of a foul assasin.
In his dying moments Larnigan'sson,
his associate, swears to hunt down this
vile syndicate and avenge the death of
his beloved father. Thus the story
opens with young Bruce Larnigan
electioneering for the office of District
Attorney to succeed his father, Uruce
is in love with Dorothy Maxwell, the
beeutiful daughter of the headrof the
insurance interests. Then through the
many episodes runs a thread of the
most amazing, most spectacular, and
most stirring events in the entire his
tory of American politics intensified
and influenced by a heart-throbbing
romance of the two young lovers,
Uruce and Dorothy.
It is for the reasons of uplift, for the
purifying of rotten American politics
as it exists in this country, apait from
the beautiful romance it reveals, that
Graft" will instantly commend itself
to every liberty and fair play loving
man, woman and child in this great and
grand country of the btars and stripes,

LANCASTER WOMAN
NINETY YEARS OLD.
Mrs. Elizabeth Mason, Laucaster's
oldest citizen and one of the most
highly esteemed women of the county,
celebrated her 90th birthday last Sun
day, at the home of her son, former
Circuit Clerk William B. Mason, of
this city. Many were the expressions
of love and esteem extended this highly
revered woman, various tokens and
gifts attesting to her popularity.
She was born at this place January
23, 1820, and united with the Christian
Church here seventy-four years ago,
being immersed in a pond within 100
yards of the dwelling where she now
resides. She was before her marriage,
Miss Logan, of that famous pioneer

was named.
ROBBERS, BOLD AND BAD
Blow Safe At Depot And Force Entrance
To McRobcrls Drug Store.
Sometime between midnight and day
light this morning robbers entered the
depot by breaking the glass in the door
and turning the night latch. Then
with a large railroad wrench they
twisted the knob from the saf and
filled it with explosives and touched it
off; the result being a totally demol
ished safe, the door of which wus blown
across the room and into a desk, which
was also demolished. The robbers se
cured only a few cents in stamps, as
Mr. Patterson tells us he never leaves
any money in the safe. A sack con
taining about five dollars in change
was not found, although it was hidden
in one corner of the room.
The money box to the safe was car
ried out the railroad, south of the
depot, where It was found about seven
o'clock this morning. Sometime dur
ing the early morning the drug store
of R, E. McRoberts was alio entered,
by breaking the glass in the frontdoor)
Nothing of importance has been missed
from this store although the cases con
taining the narcotics, were roughly
tampered with, showing conclusively
that the intruders were after "dope"
of some character. There is no clue to
the robbers, yet there it some talk of
securing blood hounds.

MORE ANCIENT HISTORY.
In a paper published in Lancaster,
wo wont Bay when, known as the "Ken
tucky Visitor" and edited by A. li.
Elkin and M. M. Vaughan, we find the
following interesting item;
"The regular debate at the Franklin
Institute last Friday was quite inter
esting. The subject for discussion was
"Should women have equal political
and civil rights with men?1' The alllr
mative was composed of the tollowing
Indies; Misses Maggie Lear, Jennie
bweeney, Lou Grant and Jennie Faulk
ner; the negative, Misses Annie Bright,
AdaMarrs. Kate Mason and Nellie
Duncan. The question was decided in
favor of the negative. The matter is
now settled, and the question that has
been vexing the minds of a civilized
world for centuries is buried forever in
the vortex of oblivion. "Requiescat in
pace.".
The same paper In 1879 has the fol
lowing personal:
"Garrard was well represented in the
way of 23nd Speakers at Danville this
year, J. B. Kinnaird and W. S. Elkin
being respectively the First and Third
speakers of the Deiuologian Society."
In the Issue of Dec. llth, 1879. we
found the following interesting item;
"The bell for the new Presbyterian
church, was hung last Friday, and its
first sound created considerable sensa
tion among our people. It has a clear,
sweet tone, and weighs about 600 lbs.
The church has been announced to be
ready for dedication on the 23th of this
month."
