Representative Hul] is preparing an
amendment to carry the tax to incomes
below $3,000, and make graded in
creases in the surtaxes on incomes
exceeding $20,000 a year.
So far the problem of raising the
revenue for national defense, although
approached from many angles, has not
been carried toward any effectual so
lution, because with the constitution
ality of the income tax undecided, ad
ministration leaders were reluctant to
place too much dependence upon it.
The decision was announced by
Chief Justice White. It was rendered
in the appeal of Frank R. Brushaber
from the action of the New York fed
eral court in refusal to enjoin the
Southern Pacific of which Brushaber
was a stockholder, from paying the
tax. The case raised substantially
every point involved in all five cases
in court.
Young Would Find a
Boy for Naval Cadet
Washington, ]Jan. 22—Representa-.
tive George M. Young of the second
district of North Dakota has decided
to fill a vacancy at the naval academy
of Annapolis by having a competitive
examination. The boy who can pass
the best examination will get the ap
pointment, which means a free educa
tion, including clothes and traveling
expenses to Annapolis, Maryland. The
examination will be held at Jamestown
on Saturday, Feb. 19, 1916, at 10
o'clock a. m. All boys from 16 to 19
years old, both years inclusive, are
eligible if they have resided in the
second congressional district two
years.
Representative Young thinks that
merit, not political pull, should gov
ern the selection of boys ror the
naval academy. He also believes
that the test should not be confined
to mental qualifications and has di
rected that only 50 per cent, be cred
ited for the mental examination, 20
per cent for physical examination
and 30 per cent for character and
manliness.
The mental examination, covering
the subjects of grammar, spelling,
American history, arithmetic alge
bra and geometry, will be conducted
by President B. H. Kroeze of the
Jamestown college, City Superintend
ent of Schools N. C. Koontz and State
High School Inspector Edwards. Phy
sical examination by Dr. Peake, Dr. R.
G. DePuy and Dr. Guest. Character
and manliness, J. B. Gurgster, W. R.
Kellogg and M. P. Morris.
In case the one receiving the high
est markings at the examination at
Jamestown fails to pass the regular
government examination for Annap
olis, which will be held April 18, or
fails to pass the physical examination
of the government doctors, the one
'receiving the second highest markings
will be appointed by Representative
Young. Those desiring further infor
mation in respect to the examination
should write to President B. H.
Kroeze, of Jamestown College, James
town. :/V

Sinreme Court Finds Income
Washington, Jan. 24.—The income
tax was declared constitutional today
by the supreme court in a unanimous
decision which swept aside every
point raised against it, and in the
opinion of administration leaders,
opened the way for an income tax on
great fortunes to help pay for the
national defense.
Proposals are pending in congress
to tax incomes of more than $1,000,000
as high as 50 per cent. Leaders on
all sides agree that the impetus which
the decision will give such proposals,
is likely to cause a definite movement
to levy on the revenue from great
private fortunes for some of the mil
lions the government must raise to
carry on the army and navy increases.
"The supreme court decision has ab
solutely unfettered the income tax as
a source of revenue," said Representa
tive Hull of Tennessee, author of the
bill. "All doubt is removed and con
gress is left much freer to act. I be
lieve congress will take advantage of
the opportunity to amend the law ma
terially. Without any unusual or un
just changes it can be made to yield
$185,000,000 to $195,000,000 a year as
against $85,000,000 or $90,000,000 at
present."

Slate Auditor Explains
the Elevator Tax Situation
County Auditor Nelson has had a lot
of explaining to do about the collection
of a terminal elevator tax when the
legislature repealed the bill providing
for the building of the elevator. The
following correspondence with State
Auditor Jorgenson throws some light
on the subject:
Valley City, N. D., Jan. 18,1916.
CarKO. Jorgenson, State Auditor,
Bismarck, N. Dak.
Dear Sir:—
I have been requested several times
by farmers belonging to the Society
of Equity to ask about terminal eleva
tor tax. I wish you would inform me
when this law was passed and how
long taxes have been derived from said
source. Also what has been done with
the money that came into the state
treasury from said levy, seeing the
legislature did not see fit to allow
them to have an elevator. Also, when
the legislature denied them the right
for an elevator, why are we paying
.125 mills for terminal elevators for
1915 taxes if we are not to have an
elevator.
An early reply will be appreciated,
as this question has been asked by
nearly every farmer that comes into
the office and I cannot explain it to
them. Please explain same to me as
clearly as possible.
Thanking you in advance, I am,
Respectfully yours,
C. W. NELSON,
Auditor Barnes County, N. D.
Bismarck, N. D., Jan. 21, 1916.
C. W. Nelson, Auditor Barnes County,
Valley City, North Dakota.
Dear Sir:—
In reply to your letter of the 18th
about the terminal elevator tax, I am
enclosing herewith a copy of Chapter
279 of the Session Laws of 1913, which
provides for the levy of the terminal
elevator tax. According to this you
will find that it was the duty of the
board of control to investigate the
terminal elevator question and make
a report of their findings to the legis
lature in 1915. It was expected, I pre
sume, that the report of the board of
control would be favorable to the
building of a terminal elevator, but
you will remember that the legislature
refused to pass a bill providing foi
the puchase, or leasing of such an ele
vator. They even went so far as to
repeal the terminal elevator law by
Chapter 258 of the Session Laws of
1915. This law, however, was sus
pended under the initative and refer
endum act during 1915, so it became
necessary for the state board of equali
zation, in 1915, to continue the levy
of this tax.
The law provides for the levy of
one-eighth of a mill for this purpose
during the years 1914, 1915 and 1916.
In 1914 the state board of equaliza
tion refused to continue to levy a
state tax in excess of the four mill
limit provided by the constitution.
This resulted in a cut in the revenue
for educational institutions which par
ticipated in the distribution of the
additional mill tax. The institutions
brought suit against the state board
of equalization with the idea that they
could compell the board to levy the
full mill tax. The supreme court, how
ever, held that the constitutional
limit of four mills must be lived up
to, so in 1914 we did not levy the one
eighth of a mill as named in the law,
but discounted that levy 38.4 per cent,
as it was necessary to do with all
of the other special taxes.
I am sending, under separate cover,
a copy of the state board of equaliza
tion's report for 1914 and would call
your attention to the levies adopted
by the board, on pages 82 and 87. If
you will also refer to the report of the
state auditor, sent herewith, you will
find his comment on the state tax levy
on page 11.
The net amount on which we levied
a tax in 1914 was approximately
$308,000,000. A levy of .0771 for ter
minal elevators would give you ap
proximately $23,746. This amount of
levy has been collected during 1915
and I find that on Jan. 1, 1916, the
cash credit to the terminal elevator
tax fund is $21,925.17. It is possible
that this will be increased close to
$23,000 by the time we have drawn
on the counties for their December
collections, which cover the sales.
The assessment for 1915 is approxi
mately $380,000,000 and the levy of
one-eighth of a mill on this assessment
would bring approximately $45,000 for

Invites Entire Lodges to
Attend Special Services
An invitation has been Issued by
Rev. C. E. Vermilya to the various
lodges of the town to be the guests of
the Methodist church at one of the
Sunday services during February and
part of March. Seats are to be re
served and the lodge will come in a
body. On Feb. 6 the Masonic Lodge
will be present, and on Feb. 13 the
Odd Fellows. Others will follow each
weeks and the dates will be announced
later.
This is a unique plan and finds its
motive in the interest Mr. Vermilya
has in men. The many men who at
tend his services from week to week
indicates that his messages appeal to
them. The members of the various
lodges have shown their appreciation
of the invitation by a speedy accept
ance of the same.
cash balance, which I have mentioned,
as being oh hand Jan. 1, remains in
tact and cannot be used for any pur
pose until the legislative assembly de
signates a purpose. Any money col
lected from time to time from this
levy shall be credited to the terminal
elevator fund and will not be disposed
of in any way until we have been au
thorized what to do with it by the
legislature.
If the people of this state are some
time going to be favorable of enter
ing into the business of handling a
terminal elevator, I believe that it is
a good thing to build up this fund as
we are doing. If all the taxes now
levied for this purpose are collected
there will only be a fund of some
$60,000 or $65,000, and from some of
the reports we have as to cost of pur
chasing, leasing and managing a ter
minal elevator it will be necessary to
have a great deal more than the
amount now in sight if a sufficiently
large elevator is operated to produce
the results which we want.
It might be well for me to explain
that the initative and referendum peti
tions which have been filed against
the repeal of the terminal elevator
tax do nothing more than suspend
that law. At the next general elec
tion the people of this state will vote
on the question whether they wish the
terminal elevator tax to stand or not.
If the people vote for the repeal of
the terminal elevator tax and uphold
the petitions filed, then we will have
levied this tax vhen there really
would have been no necessity for levy
ing it. But the state board of equali
zation has no means of knowing
whether the voters will uphold the
terminal elevator tax or whether they
will uphold the law passed by the 1915
legislature providing for its repeal, so
it became necessary to levy the tax
until the people might settle the ques
tion by vote. If the people vote for
the repeal of the tax this fall, then it
will be necessary for the legislature to
pass a law providing for the disposi
tion of the moneys collected to the
credit of the terminal elevator tax
fund.
If I have overlooked answering any
part of your inquiry, let me know and
I will furnish you with any other in
formation you may need.
Yours very truly,
CARL JORGENSON,

The Valley City aggregation did not

31 to 9, neither team will have much
advantage and a hard fought game

ESTABLISHED 1S7I.
The entire community was shocked
Saturday afternoon when the news
flew like wildfire that a portion of the
sidewalk had given away in front of
the Rex theater just as the people were
leaving after the matinee, "The Cave
Man," and that little Daniel Gill had
lost his life and others injured, among
them the daughter of the mayor of the
city, Miss Laila Platou. So many re
ports were heard that it was hard to
get at the facts but the following is as
nearly correct as it is possible to get
it when all are so awe stricken. There
is an area under the sidewalk, directly
in front of the Rex exit, covered by a
reinforced concrete slab with glass
lights, and this through the action of
frost and the constant wear had be
come weakened. The most of the audi
ence had safely passed out and gone,
among them Mr. and Mrs. Sam Gill,
parents of the unfortunate Daniel, who
was there in company with Grace
Stern, a daughter of Abe Stern, and a
little cousin of the Stern children, from
Minneapolis. The children being seat
ed farther to the front were later in
coming out. When Daniel stepped on
the slab it gave way, precipitating him
and his two little companions to the
area way underneath, a drop of some
eight or nine feet. Miss Laila Platou
was also a victim, and more would
probably have fallen had it not been
for the quick action of Arthur Busdick
er, one of the ushers, who saw the acci
dent and quickly closed the door, thus
averting a worse tragedy.
P. G. Davidson was just coming out
of the Rudolf cafe when he heard the
noise of the falling stone and was on
the scene immediately, jumping down
into the area and was met there by
Mr. Burch, of the Rex, who had run
down the area stairs. They assisted
Miss Platou up the stairs and helped
the little Stern children up, not notic
ing the little Gill boy at first. He was
pinned under the slab, which weighed
in the neighborhood of 300 pounds, and
with an iron angle bar crushed into his
face. He was gently picked up and
carried to the office of Dr. Platou, by
Mr. Davidson, where he passed away
in a very few seconds. Death was al
most instant, and it. is thought the
child was mercifully saved from suf
fering as he must have been uncon
scious from the first. After all had
been done for him, Dr. Platou turned
to find his own daughter suffering with
a fractured left fore-arm and an ugly
cut across the wrist which required
several stitches to secure. The Stern
children were not injured beyond a
few bruises and a nervous shock.
The mother of little Daniel has been
completely prostrated since the acci
dent and is in a serious condition at
present. Mr. Gill, accompanied by his
brother, who had heard of the affair
and hastened to the city, took the re
mains of the child to Minneapolis Sun
day night, and burial will be made
there in the Jewish cemetery. Friends
have done all that could be done to
assist the grief stricken parents or to
alleviate their sorrow, and flowers and
condolences were sent from all direc
tions. In this time of trouble all hearts
are touched and everyone thinks of
their own loved ones, and their sym
pathy goes out to all who are bereft.
The Rex doors were closed and the
evening performance cancelled. Re
ports from Miss Platou Monday after
noon were that she was getting alon»
nicely, but was feeling the effect of her
bruises and the shock quite a little.
