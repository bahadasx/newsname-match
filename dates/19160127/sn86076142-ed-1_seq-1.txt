NIGHT IN ELKS' HALL
The concert given last evening In
the assembly hall of the high school
under the auspices of the Lyceum

Thomas Valentine Pureell, basso and
violinist, constituted a trio or music
al stars such has have seldom been
heard here.
The program was a diadem of gems,
rare and exquisite. In solo, duet or
trio, the three voices were distinct
and blended with unusual harmony
that envoked prolonged applause by
those who appreciate good music.
In magnitude Leeta border ranked
nrst, with a soprano voice of mar
velous quality and range and which
she had under perfect control. Slight
and slender of stature, she Btood be
fore her audience and In liquid tones
true and pure as a bird's she seem
ed to soar to Infinite helghths without
visible effort. No tremor marred the
tones which thrilled ana thrilled at
times in the wildest abandon of ex

WHITE PINE MAY GET
A CARLOAD OF ELK
The board of county commission
ers of White Pine county are in re
ceipt of a letter from Secretary of
State Brodigan announcing that a
carload of elk from the government
reservation In Montana could be had
by White Tine county by the pay
ment of freight on the animals, which
amounts to $350 at Carson City. As
the elk would come from the east, It
Is probable that the freight rate to
Ely would be considerably less than
the rate to Carson City. The matter
was referred by the board to the
White Pine Rod and Gun club, which
is expected to take favorable action
on the proposition within the near
future. If the elk are received It Is
probable that they will be protected
for a few years by the forest rangers
and also by legislative enactment.

BY THE GRAND JURY
Report Presented Last Night t
Judge Mark R.

Following is the report of the Nye
county grand Jury, which was sub
mitted at 9:15 o'clock last night to
Judge Averill:
To the Honorable Mark R. Averill,
Judge of the Fifth Judicial District
Court of the State of Nevada, in and
for Nye County, Tonopah, Nevada.
Sir: In compliance with law, we
have the honor to make our final re
port to you on the deliberations of
this body for the year 1915.
Through committees appointed by
the foreman, we have endeavored to
investigate all matters relating to the
public welfare and Interest,' and the
results of our conclusions are em
bodied herein.
Criminal Law
We found seven true bills as a re
sult of evidence being presented to us
as follows:
State of Nevada vs. Jack Bardness,
Guard Kelsey, N. Richmond, Harry
L. DeGroot, Victor Barron, William
Hall, D. Morris.
We have conducted four investiga
tions, the nature of which charges we
do not deem It necessary to review
herein, tor the reason that sufficient
evidence was not presented to us
upon which to return Indictments.
The general conditions of the
county in respect to law and order
we found to be generally satisfactory.
However, there are certain infrac
tions of the law, which occur from
time to time by reason of certain
classes of people using deadly weap
ons and we regret that it is not with
in our power to prevent the perni
cious practice of carrying concealed
weapons. The correction of this evil
would save Injury and many lives of
good and peaceful citizens who suf

eliminate a heavy portion of the ex

pense of conducting examinations by
grand juries in bringing in indict-,
menu. At times the law Is broken
in this respect and by reason of the
fact that the Injured party cannot be
compelled to appear against the cul
prit, on account of intimidation or
some other cause, the culprit has
either never been brought to trial, or
dismissed, and after having been In
dicted, allowed to go free to con
tinue if be so desired, his pastime of
Inflicting injury or some fellow being
as the fancy might move him.
We believe the practice of dismiss
ing culprits who have broken the
law without an attempt to give them
the punishment deserved, should be
prevented unless under extreme cir
cumstances; also that the Indiscrim
inate practice of carrying concealed
weapons should be remedied. This
practice might prove a little more ex
pensive In the beginning, but we be
lieve would justify ' by the whole
some respect that would be instilled
Into violators of the law when they
realize that they must without excep
tion answer for crime when commit
ted. It is evident that if those who
disobey the law are aware of the fact
that they will be taken to taak with
out exception, when they commit
crimes that are againBt the peace and
dignity of their community, it la ap
parent that it will not only have a
good effect upon the community at
large, but serve to reduce the num-'
ber of offenses.
