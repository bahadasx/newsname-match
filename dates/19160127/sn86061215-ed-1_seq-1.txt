BRITISH liBO
Representatives of More
Than Two Million Men
Consider Matter
AUSTRIANS MAKING
GAINS IN ALBANIA
Renewal of Fierce Fighting
on the Western Front
Is Expected Soon
Bristol, Eng., Jan. 26.—The
British labor conference adopted
today, by a vote of 1,847,000
against 206,000, a resolution entire
ly approving the action of the par
liamentary labor party in cooper
ating with other political parties
in the national recruiting cam
paign.
London, Jan. 26.—The opening
'phrase of the speeches of Sir Ed
ward Qrey, foreign secretary, in
the house of commons, and of the
Marquis of Landsdowne, minister
without portfolio, In the house of
.lords, to(tay gave the impression
that the British government Is not
likely to. resort to an absolute
blockade of Germany.
The debate, is attracting wide
spread attention, being expected
to end the bitter controversy rela
tive to the strengthening of the
measure# taken to restrict Ger
many's foreign trade.
Arthur' Shirley Benn, unionist
member for Plymouth, on intro
ducing the motion for an effective
-blockade, urged the government In
conjunction with the entente allies
to declare thit the entire over
oceanic trafflti with Germany shall
be prevented .fay blockade. H«
said he dfd not think America
would object as the blockade
would be on the same principle as
was the blockade declared by Lin
coln.
-London, Jan. 16—The position of the
British government on two subjects of
prime Importance in the conduct of the
war Is to be determined as a result of
proceedings under way today. The
attitude of labor toward compulsory
.military service will be decided at the
great conference meeting today in
Bristol. The debate on the question
of a blockade of Germany Is before
the house of commons.
The Bristol conference is the most
lmportannt of this kind ever held in
England, representing more than
2,000,000 members of trades unions.
The compulsory military service bill
having passed the house of commons
and encountered little opposition in
the house of lords, the outcome of the
long campaign on this issue will de
pend largely on the attitude of or
ganized labor.
Although great opposition to com
pulsion developed at the London labor
conference, it is believed this feeling
has died down.
Austrians Gain.
The Austrian drive down the eastern
coast of the Adriatic having passed
beyond the Montenegrin border, is
now said to have resulted in the cap
ture of an Albanian seaport, San
Giovanni di Medua.
Rome advices Indicate that the Ital
ian government is concerned at the
extension of Austrian influence south
ward along the Adriatic but there are
no indications that further measures
to oppose the Teutonic forces are un
der way. It* is said no alarm is felt in
Rome for Avlona, which has been oc
cupied by Italian troops, or for Dur
azzo in the hands of Essad Pasha,
provisional president of Albania, who
has cast his lot with the entente
allies.
Heavy Fighting on West.
London morning papers emphasize
the renewal of heavy fighting on the
western front and predict that Ger
man activity in the west will probably
reach its height on Thursday when the'
German emperor celebrates his fifty
seventh birthday.
A Rome dispatch says the Austrians
hare occupied San Giovanni di Medua,
a seaport in Albania.
The official statement from Petro
grad says that Russian artillery suc
cessfully bombarded German positions
in the region of the Dvina, below
Freidrichstadt. In Galicia on the
Stripa front an artillery duel has been
(n progress. In the Caucasus in the
vicinity of Erzerum the Russians claim
to be pressing the Turks closely and
that they have taken prisoners.
The London Daily Mail correspond
ent who saw the German emperor at
Nish, Serbia, on January 18, says he
is greatly aged and that at a royal
banquet there the emperor spent more
time coughing than eating.
A Vienna statement says the dis
arming of the Montenegrins is pro
grjBCieing without Interruption.

BUT STILL READY
TO MEET THE FOE
PREMIER SAYS ALLIES HAVE BUT
TO FEED THE ARMY AND IT
WILL FIGHT.
Paris, Jan. 26.—The Corfu corres
pondent of the Petit Parisien has had
an interview on the1 island with Niko
la Pachitch, the Serbian premier, and
quotes him as saying:
"The retreat of our troops from
Albania to Corfu is far from complet
ed. Those who suffered most will soon
be sent to places where they will be
cared for, reorganized and rearmed.
As for the others, if they are kept
supplied, you may be sure they will
continue the campaign in Albania with
vigor. They will give the enemy some
unpleasant surprises, for in Albania
the roads and paths can be defended
by small numbers of men and it is
simply a question of transports and
supplies and you alone, the allies, can
solve the problem.
"Give us enough to eat and we shall
hold on and we shall fight. I am cer
tain that with you and by your aid
we shall triumph. I repeat that we are
absolutely Bure that the allies will
triumph and our one wish is to be able
to contribute to the great victory."
ITALIANS SURPRISED.
Rome, Jan. 26.—A dispatch from
San Giovanni dl Medua to the Idea
Nazionale
sayB
the Montenegrins
made a determined stand on Mt. Tar
bosch in an effort to save the city ol
Scutari, but that a strong Austtian
column forced the garrison to evaou
ate the place and the detachment on
the mountain to retreat.
The women, it is stated, conducted
themselves as heroically as the men,
carrying on their backs during the
retreat everything that was necessary
to continue the struggle.
Although the fall of Scutari was dis
counted by the Italian public, the sud
denness with which it was brought
about has caused surprise. Keen in
terest is manifested in political circles
regarding the entire Albanian ques
tion. Baron Sonnino, the Italian for
eign minister, had a conference this
morning wLth the king and it is un
derstood that at the meeting of the
Italian cabinet tomorrow the Alban
ian question will be discussed.
ATTACKS REPULSED.
Berlin, Jan. 26.—A great number of
counter attacks were made by the
French yesterday to recapture the
trenches taken by the Germans east
of Neuville but they were repulsed
each time after hand to hand fighting,
says the statement issued today by
German army headquarters staff.
An official Turkish statement receiv
ed here today says British forces in
Mesopotamia made another attack on
the Turks but gave up the effort after
sustaining appalling losses.
OF
U.S. DOLE PLANNED
Washington, D. C., Jan. 26.—An
amendment to the Philippine bill, said
to be acceptable to President Wilson,
was submitted today by Chairman
Hitchcock of the Philippine committee.
It would provide that not more than
four years, nor less than two years
after the meeting of the new Filipino
legislature to be created by the pend
ing bill, the president should withdraw
the sovereignty of the United States
and proclaim the independence of the
Filipino people provided they enter
into such binding agreements with the
United States as the president may
deem necessary for the protection of
recognized rights and interests of
Americans and other nationals in the
islands.
The president would be empowered
to reserve naval bases, coaling sta
tions and other property required by
the United States for military pur
poses.
The amendment would further pro
vide that, if at any time before the
expiration of four years, the president
should find that proper steps had not
been taken to establish an independ
ent government, or if he should be un
able to negotiate agreements for pro
tection of American property, the
president would be authorized to delay
recognition of Philippine independence
until the American congress could
further consider the case.
The amendment also would author
ize the president to invite cooperation
of the principal nations of the world
mutually to pledge themselves to
maintain the Philippine independence
against any external force.

VILLA AROUSES
.S.
"Remember Orozco" Is the
Rallying Cry of the
Northern Rebel
LATTER SHOT WHILE
IN UNITED STATES
American Live Stock Men
Ask the Government to
Protect Citizens
El Paso, Tex., Jan. 26.—Francisco
Villa, now in western Chihuahua de
fying the forces of the Carranza gov
ernment is using the cry, "Remember
Orozco," to stir up hatred against
Americans and gain recruits for him
self according to foreigners who
reached the border today.
Gen. Orozco was Villa's moat for
midable foe until the later drove him
across the border into the United
States after the battle of Ojlnaga,
nearly two years ago. Orozco was
shot and killed last September on this
side of the boundary after he had for
feited the bond under whidh he was
being held as a violator of United
States neutrality laws. Villa, taking
advantage of the circumstances of
Orozco's death, is declared to be using
his name as a rallying cry for new re
cruits.
The reports were brought to the
border by foreigners who were in Chi
huahua City during the period just be
fore and after Villa evacuated the
capital.
Thirty-six Americans were thrown
into prison just before Villa left the
city, a number of Chinese were shot
and the stores belonging to them and
to Japanese were looted and burned, it
was reported. Villa made a point, they
said, of not threatening Englishmen
and Germans.
The bandit chief announced that he
intended to hold the Americans until
they paid $307000, but they were re-'
leased when Villa was told that re
leasing them was the only condition
under which he would be allowed to
enter the United States, if he were
forced to flee northward.
DEMAND PROTECTION.
®1 Paso, Tex., Jan. 26. —Approval by

ican question before the delegates to
the nineteenth annual convention here
today.
Protection for foreigners by means
of American patrols within a district
100 miles south of the border until per
manent peace Is established, is urged
in the measure and a committee of
three is to go to Washington to pre
sent facts concerning border condi
tions.
AMERICANS GUARDED.
Washington, D. C., Jan. 26— Ameri
can employes of the Yoquiv| Develop
ment Co. at Minaca, Chihuahua, left
there yesterday on a special train
guarded by Carranza soldiers for Chi
huahua City, state department advices
today from El Paso reported.
American Consul Silllman at Quere
taro reported Gen. Carranza showing
an apparent desire to comply as far
as possible with the demands of the
United States to protect Americans
and their interests.
GREEKS PERMITTED

use of railway and other companies
in Greece in accordance with their
needs and also to meei the- reqmre
ments of the Greek navy.
Great Britain also agrees to place
no difficulties In the way of exporta

AUSTRIA WANTS
VERONA MATTER
EMBASSY DE8IRE8 TO KNOW
WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH
ARMED ITALIAN 8H1P.
Washington, D. C., Jan. 26.—Baron
Erich Zwiedinek, charge of the Aus
tro-Hungarlan embassy, asked the
state department what the United
States intended to do in the case of
the Italian steamship Verona, which
arrived in New York several days ago
with two guns mounted at her stern.
The Inquiry was the same as that
made by the charge in the case of the
Italian steamer Guiseppe Verdi, which
reached New York with two guns
mounted aft. The Verdi was allowed
to sail on her return trip. Indica
tions are that the Austrian govern
ment may notify the United States
that any other merchant vessels per
mitted to sail with guns aboard, even
if intended for defense only, will be
considered hostile craft, subject to
being sunk without warning.
BERNSTORFF SEES LANSING.v
Washington, D. C., Jan. 26.—Secre
tary Lansing had an engagement to
confer again today with Count von
Bernstroff, the German ambassador,
over the controversy growing out of
the sinking of the liner Lusitania.
Germany's last proposal In the Lusi
tania negotiations, having failed to
satisfy President Wilson and Secre
tary Lansing, the ambassador, it was
said, was to submit another tentative
proposal for settlement, embodying
the requirements of the United States.
The United States, It was authorita
tively stated today, would insist on
holding the German government to "a
strict accountability" for the loss of
American lives, and desires that, the
Berlin government admit, in effect,
that it is liable according to law for
lives of neutrals lost in the commis
sion of an act against a vessel of the
enemy.
Teutonic diplomatic circles were op-
timigtic regarding the putcome^de
Hspffe the United States' refusal to ac
cept the last proposal.

London, Jan. 26. —The foreign office
handed to the American embassy to
day an ad interim reply to the Ameri
can protest against detention of the
malls. The note states that a formal
answer to the representatives of the
United States will be made as soon as
the French government has signified
its approval of the attitude of Great
Britain.
It is understood the formal reply
will defend the action of the British
authorities by citing evidence that
Germans have been abusing the privi

government will rely on the postal
conventions adopted at The Hague for
justification of its measures.

Efforts to prevail upon President
Wilson to make a visit to Ottumwa
on his western trip, either the first one
or at a later date, have not been given
up by U. S. Marshal N. F. Reed and
others In this section of the state. A
communication read Tuesday before
the meeting of the directors of the
Commercial association from Mr. Reed
shows that there is a well organized
effort to get the president to consider
Ottumwa and southern Iowa on his
Itinerary. The association will co
operate with Marshal Reed in the cam
paign to get the executive to come
here.
The communication received by the
association tells what has already been
done and what is contemplated. That
It may prove effective is hoped by the
association and those who have inter
ested themselves in the matter. The

States protested to
Great Britain last month against inter
ference with mails between (his coun
try and Sweden. Large quantities of
mail matter, particularly parcel post
packages, have been taken from a
number of steamships which were de
tained
in
British ports
on
the continent.
The mail bags taken from the Frisia
contained rolled gold chains, gold ear
rings, bracelets, rings and brooches,
and drugs, dyes, oleographs and ma
chine needles.
The Tubantia's mail bags are said to
have contained four sacks of rubber in
packets, marked "samples, without
value" of a total weight of 73
pounds and addressed to Hamburg
.from Brazil, and also seven packets of
wool from Uruguay to Berlin of sam
ple size.
The examination of the Ryndam's
mail bags Is alleged to have shown
that the mails contained 60 per cmt
newspapers, 30 per cent propaganda,
and 10 per cent goods, "all of enemy
origin," and addressed in most cases
to firms with German names in the
United States.
"The foregoing particulars," it was
said at the foreign office, "show the ex
tent to which the postal mails are be
ing used by the enemy as a means of
conveyance of goods to evade the
measures of restrictions of trade by
the British government. By no possi
ble stretch can it be contended that in
the majority of the foregoing cases the
articles seized are postal correspon
dence or samples, to which alone can
be applied such Immunity as the
postal malls enjoy.''
M. Reno, is striv­
ing with the boosters of the project
to bring about the coveted object.
The district meetings of the demo
crats this week along the Burlington
route are passing resolutions which
are to be sent to the president urging
him to come this way or to travel
through the state from Burlington to
Council Bluffs. Such a resolution will
be adopted at the meetings in Burling
ton today, Ottumwa Thursday and
Creston Friday, and are believed will
have much weight in convincing the
president of how much he is desired
in this vicinity. Commercial clubs and
others in this part of Iowa are renew
ing their invitations to the president
to have him stop.
The directors also took up the ques
tion of the annual banquet and meet

of the arrangements for the event. The
committee has not yet been named.
