four saddles, saying as they did so
that they would be back as soon as

Here they pullled another one. They
sold a horse to one Mr.: Reynolds,
who paid theni; they to leave the
horse in the pasture where' he had
been duVing the previous night
I'hey took the money but forgot to
leave the horse. Deputy, Sheriff
HogsHt had been on and never lost
their trail until he finally succeed
ed in overtaking them just as they
caine into Clayton on Thursday
night. He succeeded in keeping the
trail by means of a crooked hind
hoof of one of their Horses which he
observed directly after taking the
trail. ' '
The saddles were turned over to
and returned by Mr. Hogsott, tho
prisoners remaining in the custody

l'he Citizen, . , ,
Clayton, X. Mex.
I notice in your last issue'tliat the
mention of Union counly having a
farm demonstrator is before our
County Commissioners for consider
ation and that you are willing to
publish whatever comments we
make.
I feel this is an issue most of the
residents are interested in.
In the ilrst place in the. moro
thickly settled parts of our country
this plan has . very generally been
adopted and I have never known ol
a case where it has not proved a beu-
ellt greatly exceeding the cost per
capita.
This being true how much more
benefit it would surely be where the
most of our resources are as yet un
developed. There seems to be Iwq items that
are very importaul in considering
this question. . . v, . ' ;
First the cost, yej. wheii we re
member how large our county is and
how little our' taxes would have to
be raised and knowing that farmers
where this system has' been adopted
have been able to save hundreds of
dollars each season . in marketing
their . crops as Well as increasing
their yields, it seems to Ine this
should hot iirevent us from having,
ii farm .demonstrator, i
, -'Iheir the- question, of getting a
good man for the place codes up.
(I mean by that one, who is more
interested than mereiy drawing bis
sr'lury.) And it seems in all of our
(eat county there should be one
.man who would be willing to visit
our farmers, business men and clubs ,
and help them to learn the right
relations toward each other, and I
am sure be of inestimable value to
iill of them.' ;
Yours for a farm demonstrator,
