WASHINGTON, U C, Jan. 27.
Although no specific announce
ment lias been made, it is almot
certain that S. C. Iluber of Tama,
, Iowa, will be selected for United
States district attorney for Hawaii.
-Air.-' Iluber is a prominent attor
ney and Democratic politician -"of
Iowa. He was recently in ash
ington by request of administration
leaders and talked over the. situa
tion in Hawaii with Attorney-gen
-era! Gregory and others.
.He is pronounced now the "be
let' for the position.
C. S. ALBERT.
M'CARN SAID TO BE AT
WORK AGAINST JUDGES
ROBERTSON AND WHITNEY
The rumored selection of the Iowa
roan, Huber, as district attorney for
Hawaii cornea as an entire surprise
to local politicians. It Is now conjec
tured that the attorney-general and
the president regard Senator Coke as
technically disqualified from serving,
as previous reports were almost un
anlmous in saying that Coke was first
choice, for the place held by Jeff M6
Carn of Tennessee during two stormy
years and cow temporarily held bj
Horace W. Vaughan of Texas.
Coke: dUbuallficiuou arise from
the fact that his term as a territorial
senator still continues and under the
organic act he cannot take such an
appointive position as the district at
tomeyship. f r
Whether McCarn has been backing
Huber for the position is not known
here. His fight on Vaughan is cer
tainly being kept up. Furthermore, it
Is reported on good authority that
McCarn is organizing a fight in the
U. S. Senate against the confirmation
of two Hawaii Judgea given recess ap
pointments by the president Chief
Justice Robertson and Circuit Judge
Whitney. It Is said that McCarn
hopes that he can line up enough Deni
ocra tic votes In the senate to defeat
their confirmation on the ground that
they are Republicans, and that, he
claims further, they are "under
the influence of the "big Interests
here a set of charge in this regard
somewhat similar to those by Circuit
Judge Stuart against Justices Robert
son and Watson. .
Justice Quarles before leaving for
the mainland not long ago w as credit
ed with the remark that he would not
return to Hawaii If thechlef justice
were confirmed, but his fellow mem
bers of the bench and bar do not
think he would relinquish his position
on this account
Were It not for tne right which Mc
Carn is known to be making on. Dis
trict Attorney Vaughan, the reported
selection of Huber for the U. S. dis
trict attorneys position would be tak
en as heralding the appointment or
Vaughan as federal Judge to succeed
the veteran S. B. Dole. But persist
ent rumors from Washington say that
McCarn'a charges, first made by let
ter and cable and later taken on per
sonally, are so explicit that not until
further information is secured , w ill
the department of justice recommend
action by the president.

On his way to Australia to give a
series of war lectures cn the Darda

one of the two official war correspon
dents allowed at the ill-fated spot by
the British war office, is a through
passenger on the Canadian-Australa
slan liner Niagara today.
"The Newspaper Proprietors Asso

don papers, were allowed to select one
representative to accompany the Dar

mead-Bartlett this morning, "and they
selected me. The other man was the
correspondent for Reuter's."
The : correspondent said that Tor
days at a time there was no news to
cable out, and that at other times im
portant developments made long cable
desnatches necessary "The interven
tion of Bulgaria made it essential to
withdraw from the Dardanelles," he
stated, and added that the English be
lieve the war will last from 18 month
to two years more.
While in New oYrk, M r. Asnmeau-
artlett asserted, he found strong evi
dences of the existence of a "war
nartvr stronelv favoring intervention
in Mexico, and advocating tbe United
States entering the European con
flict.' V'.
"The general feeling in Great Brit
ain la Quit the Allies must win, whe

Britain also feels that 'the United
