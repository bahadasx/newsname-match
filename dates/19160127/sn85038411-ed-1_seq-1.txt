Position; Austrians Con
tinue Their Drive
British possession of territory pro
tecting the Suez <"anal route at its
southern end is imperiled by at
tacks made by large bodies of Arabs
and Turks on the British forces in
Southwestern Arabia, according to
advices from German sources. The
British have been driven from all the
territory they held in that section of
the country and have suffered ex
tremely heavy losses in the fighting,
the reports declare, the figures being
given at 15,000 killed and 20,000
wounded.
The implication from the Berlin
dispatch carrying these reports is that
tlie British army of 20,000 men is now
virtually cooped up in Aden, near the
entrance to the Red Sea, which must
be held if the southerly approach to
the Suez Canal is to be protected.
A situation quite similar to this
was reported through German
agencies several weeks ago, but Lon
don llien announced officially that no
apprehensions were entertained for
the outcome of the operations which
had been merely in the nature of
skirmishes.
