Brovvn shoe factory and H. K. Scliulte,
of the department of physical educa
tion of tlie University, spoke. Judge
J II Shepherd praised the University
of Mis.-ouii and spoke in favor of pre
paredness. From 7 to 12 per cent of the stu
dents m the University work all or
part of their way thiotigh." said Mr.
Schulte. Wot enough encouragement
is given to this admirable type of stu
dent, and we lose good, desirable men
because of it. I worked most of my
wav through college, and I naturally
tight for the boy who is working for
his education, whether that boy is an
athlete or not. We hae lost men this
ear -athletes, incidentally who
were good, moral, desirable men."
Schulte Proposes a Han.
Mr Schulte presented a plan which,
lie said, had been proposed by Mr. Ho
gan. An industry in which piece
work could he done might be estab
lished in Columbia, near the Univer
sitv. Students could then work at odd
times. If necessary, the city should
hack the proposition, .Mr. Schulte
said. even if no more were to be
gained by it thi'n breaking eeii on ex
penses. About lifteen students are employed
by the shoe factory.
"We are more than satislied with our
student employes," said Mi. Ilogan.
"We want more of them."
Largely through the efforts of the
Commercial Club the local branch of
the company was established.
Factor) Averages Mm Persons.
"It has been a good investment for
Columbia," said Mr. Hogan. "An av
erage of 303 persons is employed
throughout the year; salaries paid to
our foremen are as high as those paid
to any shoe factory foremen in the
country . the factory is a potent force
both industrially and socially. Few
members of tho Commercial Club,
however, have been to see their in
estiiient "The gross shipments in shoes of
the Columbia factory during the year
Ml.', amounted to $1,132,170.77. an in
crease of .'.1 per cent over the ship
ments of I'.lll. Salaries paid in Co
lumbia during I ft!." amounted to $193.
"Ufi..i:. Three thousand pairs of shoes
a day is the present output of the fac
tory. "EflKient men are needed in a fac
tory," continued Mr. Hogan, "the same
as in an other business, and when
we liud a student who is eti'cient we
are ui.ul to employ him
Praises Honest) of Workmen.
"The in. u employed in the Columbia
factory aie of a decidedly higher type
than I hae found in other factories,"
-Mr Ilogan said. "A man in my posi
tion frequently is called upon to lend
money to his employes. I hae neer
lost a nickel in this way since I have
been in Columbia, whereas in other
places I considered myself lucky to
get back 7." per cent. I cannot praise
too highly the clean living, industry
and honesty of my employes here."
Judge Shejiherd spoke in support of
naval preparedness and praised Co
lumbia and the University. The judge
was assistant Attorney-General under
President Cleveland.
"Trade Itcasoiis Prolong War."
"Trade jealousy is what is prolong
ing this war," he said. "Everywhere
I hae roii.. I hae seen animosity
Brow ins against America particular
ly Ilrltis.li animosity because of
America's growing trade."
Cot'on was declared contraband by
England as the direct result of the
demand of Ilritish spinners, according
to Judst Shepherd. The cotton produc
es of America lost $000,000,000 in
JS15 by British seizures and legal
enactments, he added.
The speaker turned to the praise of
lle Universitv. His son was gradu
ated from the College of Agriculture
last )ear
"I hae studied this university
closely," he said. "I believe it is
ideal. No University in the country
is better, and few are its equal."
Dr. J. B. Cole supported Mr. Schulte
in his plea for employment opportuni
ties .

YES, COLUMBIA HAS A PARK
It's on orth Side of Town ami Is
.V.nned Jeanette.
Columbia lias a park. The state
ment sounds odd, in view of the re
cent agitation for a park, but it's
strictly true, nevertheless.
Columbia's park is in Odon Guitar's
Subdivision and Park Addition to the
city. This plot of land is nine blocks
north of Broadway out Third street
and is bounded by Sexton road. North
Third street. North boulevard and
Oartlt avenue. Lots 70 and 77, at the
corner of Second street and Grand
avenues, in the subdivision, comprise
the park. It is named Jeanette Park
and is 146 feet wide and 133 feet '.ong.
The description of the plot was reg
istered August 4, 1U04, when F. W.
Nedermeyer was mayor or Columbia.
Aji excerpt rrom this description tells
or the establishment or tlie park as
follows: "The ground occupied by
said streets and alleys is hereby dedi
cated to public uses, Tor tlie purposes
indicated; and lots numbered 76 and
77 as shown on said plot are hereby
set apart and devoted to public uses
as a park and place of resort for the
ovvJiers and residents and their chil
dren of said subdivision and addition,
and to be under the control of said
residents and owners, w ith authority to
erect thereon a suitable bailing to
be devoted to literary and social ob
jects, and said square or ground shall
always be known as Jeanette Park."
The two lots at present hear very
little resemblance to a park, the land
being unkept and in disuse except as
a pasture.
FIREMEN ADD TO EQUIPMENT
Home-Made Basket Constructed of
Quarter Mile of ttlre.
The newest addition to the equip
ment or the Columbia lire department
is a wire basket to hold the salvage
covers. The basket was made by the
members or tho department. It is of
heavy wire and is 12 by 14 by 30
inches. Fire Chief V.. N. Kurt, said a
quarter or mile or wire was used in
making the basket. It was necessary
to solder about eight hundred joints.
Chier Kurtz again said tint Hie Jc
partment needed the new equipment
which lie recently recommended tin
Council purchase. The auxiliary
truck is needed especially, said Kurt.,
as the heavy truck is often compelled
to go over unpaved streets, being lia
ble to mishap.

LONDON, Jan. 27. Kngland has de
clared a partial embargo on the im
portation or articles not absolutely
needed. The United States and other
neutral countries will be tlie hardest
hit by this declaration.
All merchant marine lias been plac
ed under the control of the British

minister, that France would join Eng
land in maintaining a blockade of
Germany in the English channel and
the North Sea and would participate
in tlie examination or mails ajid car

against the blockade would be re

cure the same result.
IIILLIS LIBEL SUIT IHtOPPEH
Itrnoklyii, X. Pastor and 'ephew
Agree on Settlement.
NEW YORK, Jan. 27. Charles T.
Lark, attorney for the Kev. Newell
Dvvight Hillis. pastor of Plymouth
Church. Brooklyn, made public yester
day an agreement signed by Dr. Hillis
and liis nephew, Percy D. Hillis, in
which tlie latter withdrew the libel
suit against his iwicle.
Tile suit was filed as the result of
an allegul .statement by Doctor Hillis
that he had paid out a large sum of
money in settlement of his nephew's
debts.
The dispute was finally referred to
T. K. Webster, a Chicago business
man, who acted as arbitrator with tlie
result of the present agreement.
The arbitrator found that Doctor
Hillis did pay large sums in which
his nephew was more or less inter
ested, but that they were not debts
of his nephew.
He also says that he believes that
the interview in which appeared the
statement complained of was given
over by Doctor Hillis with the best
of motives, hut that he has no doubt
it conveyed aji impression in certain
circles detrimental lo the nephew.
