SWEDEN MAY ENTER WAR
ON SIDE OF TEUTONS.
Swisien may join tlio list of
smaller nations fighting on side
of Uie BMtBSl ejiipirus within a
weuk, aeeording to information
whieh rean'hisi Senator Albert B.
Pall, at W.iMlungtin, .Monday
t Im .ugh private soureua. Decla
rat en of war will be made Upon
Hre.-it Britain and on Russia, Sen.
Palls' advices state. Actual hos
tilities, it ia said, will be begun
with an atlaek on Russia through
Piiiland.
"Tlie real reason for Sweden 's
dee laruig war, ' ' explained Senator
Palls, "Will be found to lie in
tlie repeated efforts of Great
Hi nam to force Sweden to do
this verv thinif. However great
ut term as agauist Russia may he
in Sweden, recent development in
the British blockade of Swodcn
have aroiUMsd the Sweiles to an
even more bitter hostiliity against
r.n gland, b roin the outbreak ot
the war Sweden have hwn ac
tively favorable to Germany and
has done everything in her iower
to aid lii-rinauv.
"Thia friendship with Germany
luw ban due less to any inherent
feeling f kinahip than to a fear
that if the alliiea win Sweden will
stand in danger of i-oniinest at
:he hands of a victorious Russia.
The wrongs Mffend by Finland
under Russian rule have given
rise to Uie huliof in Swollen that
Finland would offer no nvistam'c
to the passage of Svvisilish troops
through Finland heading for an
attaok on Russia.
"This antipathy against Russia
has been capitalized recently by
i i ' at Britain whose difficulties
over the matter of tlie so-called
illegal blockade of neutral ports
Im given her no inconsiderable
uneasiness. Within the past three
months sonic member of the Brit
ish cabinet awoke to the fa't
that if only war could he provok-
itd Is't.ween Swollen and Great
Britain, the whole matter of tbe
s'-a !il' k.ule would straighten it
self automnlieally."
The scais-ity of dy. stuffs, cans
d by the Kuropeiin war. is be
I'oming more acute, as eviibweil

freipietitly on iirrying in all ass
