"Our policy lu Mexico," he said,

HO OCCASION FOR ALARMIU SEIZURE
I II
Washington, Jan. 27. Press re
ports of the Mexican aelxure of two
American soldiers near Brownsville
yesterday, with the drowning of oth
ers whllo swimming in the Rio
Qrando, gave occasion for no alarm
in official circles today, according to
authorities. It was suggested, though,
that the incident might lead to a
fresh outbreak ot anti-Mexican and
anti-admlnlstratlon discussion in con
gress. Officials declared that the Ameri
can soldiers had no 'business in Mex
ico, and that the Mexican authorities
wore within their rights if they ar
rested them for crossing the boun
dary. '
This is not the first Incident of the
kind. Once a dozen soldiers crossed
near El Paso, and the Juarez authori
ties arrested them, but released them
as soon ab they ascertained that the
crossing was accidental.
If civilians and not Carranzlsta
soldiers captured the two, General
Funston probably will ask the Car
ranza commander for assurances ot
tholr safety and hold the Carran
slstas responsible for tholr safe keep
ing. If the Americans crossed the
river in attempting to rescue their
comrades, It is expected the Carran
zlsta commander will protest to Gon
eral Funston and that then an ex
change of apologies will close the
Incident.
Washington, Jan. 27, Approval ot
the arrests of American army lieuten
ants Involved in the crossing of the
Rio Grande yesterday was voiced to
day by the war department. The
tragic Incident that ended In the
drowning of fqur soldier, after two
had beqn captured on the Mexican
for Planting This Season Has
Contract (or the Erection of
few days telling of the letting of tbe
contract for the factory buildings.
With the sources from which beet
seed is obtained in Europe closed by
tho war, tbe obtaining of the seed
for the new factory became a serious
problem, other of the districts In
which the company baa factories hav
ing arranged for heavier plantings
than usual, and the call for seed haa
used up the available supply. This
known seed shortage haa caused an
apprehensive feeling on the part of
aome, though at all times the repre
sentatives of the company at Salt
Lake City have said that it would be
satisfactorily arranged. The wire
came as a confirmation of a letter
to Mr. Bramwell, written Tuesday,
stating that the matter, of seed was
expected to be definitely arranged
Wednesday, and indicated that it
was so arranged.
Tbe question of adjustment of
freight rates between the two lines
of railroad is now in process of set-
(through town Wednesday on train
No. IS for San Francisco tor a fur
ther conference with the . Southern
Pacific company. The outcome of
tbe conference will hare some bear
ing upon the exact location ot the fao
tory, though there is a feeling that
business reasons will place it on tbe
line ot the Twohy road near this
city, this placing the factory in a cen
tral location for beets from the Med-
Illinois valley
side, is likely to go before a court
martial.
The seriousness of the soldiers' ac
tion was evidenced by the fact that
the administration give quick assur
ance to the Carranzista authorities
that tho leaders of the crossing party
bad been promptly arrested.
From a staff officer came the state
men that It was "almost insane" for
the soldiers to violate the depart
ment's iron-clad rule against cross
ing the American boundary under
any circumstances.
Tbe government meantime expects
that the de facto government will
protect the two soldiers seized on the
Mexican side.
Brownsville, Texas, Jan. 27. Offl
clals here sought today to guard
against open clashes between Ameri
can and Mexican troops as a result
of the drowning ot Sergeant Owen
Clements, Corporal Michael King,
Privates Harry Rhode and Charles
WIttenbest as they were trying to
rescue Privates Wm. Wheeler and
Biago Pedorsen, whom the Mexicans
at Pregreso captured yesterday after
noon. The fate of Wheeler and
Poderscn ia unknown. But Carran
zista authorities, upon request of
American military men, are seeking
to rescue the pair. The officials
claimed at first that there waa no
patrol of Carranzista soldiers in that
neighborhood, but It is claimed defin
itely here that the captors were, in
the uniform of the de facto govern
ment. '
Meantime, General Funston main
tains that the American aoldtera were
at fault for swimming In the Rio
Grande beyond the American line.

TO COST STATE LESS
(By United Press Leased Wire.) .
j Sacramento, Jan. 27. That the
cost to the state of maintaining con
vict road laborers will be reduced
from $1.31 per day to $1 a day for
'each convict Is the opinion today ot
Highway Engineer Fletcher. The
1 coBt has been rather high because the
men worked ia the rain and it was
necessary to provide them with spe
cial clothing. But even at the $1.31
rate the venture is considered a suc
cess from a financial viewpoint be
cause the average wage Is $2.25 a
day. The convicts who have been
clearing and grading state highways
in Mendocino county are doing the
work as efficiently as paid labor, It Is
I reported. From the viewpoint ot the
, moral uplift of the convicts, the plan
has also been a success, five ot the
(workers having been paroled. Only
nine of the 115 convicts who were
sent to the road camp tailed to make
good. Five were agitators and four
attempted to escape. These were sent
back to prison.

TO FIGHT
President Tells Clergymen fa
Speech at New York That
He byways Ready to Ac
cept a Challenge to Battle
New York, Jan. 27. President
Wilson indicated plainly today he is
no longer "too proud to fight'.' ,
Speaking before 2,000 clergymen ,
of many creeds, he declared "I al
ways accept, perhaps by aome Im
pulse of my native blood, the chal
lenge to a fight,"
' Moreover, he added that with him
it waa not a "case of a knock down
and drag out, but of putting up the
best reason why your own side should
survive."
In announcing his dostrine con
cerning peace and belligerency, the
president obviously attempted to
eliminate from further discussion the
too proud 'phrase voiced In his In
dianapolis speech last year a phrase
which resulted in greater criticism
here and abroad than any other ut
terance he has made.
"I hope I do not traduce my antag
onists," he went on. "I hope I fight
them with the purpose and Intention
of converting them. I wish that th
best argument and the right purpose
shall prevail.
"Virgil says somewhere: The child
beats its nurse and cries for the
moon; the old man sips gruel humbly
and thanks God that nobody (beats
him.'
"I have not yet quite reached the
point of humility, and I always ac
cept, perhaps from some Impulse ot
my native blood, the challenge to a
fight It is not a case of knock down
and drag out, but ot putting the best
reason why your own side should sur
vive. These franknesses of contro
versy; these knightly equalities ot
conditions in the fight, are necessary
conditions precedent to peace." t
TO ENLARGE PLANT
San Francisco, Jan. 27. The Union
Iron works, which has Just purchased
the shipbuilding plant of the United
Engineering works for $1,000,000,
will spend $300,000 more improving
the place, according to announce
ment today by President J. A. Mc
Grogor. The plant will be modern
ized in every way. Machinery of the
latest type will cost $50,000, and
three new slips will be built.
McGregor declares that the busi
ness already waiting for the Union
Iron works will keep the new plant
going to capacity for an indefinite
period, and he even predicted that It
would not be long before even these
new facilities for his company would
be outgrown.
"Tbe demand for ships is almost '
beyond comprehension," said McGre
gor, "and price Is no object Just now.
I have been compelled recently to
atop negotiations because we had not
the facilities to fill the orders that
poured in."
