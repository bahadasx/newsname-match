CLUB WORK
Mrs. Graves Will Start The
Organization of Poultry
Clubs Feb. 15.
NOW TAKING SPECIAL COURSE
Will Need 1,000 White Wyan
dotte Eggs By Early
March.
Mrs. Eloise Graves, who will have
charge of the Poultry Club work in
Christian county after Feb. 15, is now
in Nashville taking a Poultry course
at Peabody College. She has been
there since January 1st, intending to
thoroughly inform" herself by the
time her active work is to begin.
This course will cost her more than
$100, but Mrs. Graves never does
things half way and she is determined
to fully qualify herself for her new
duties, to be carried on in connection
with her canning club work.
Names are already being enrolled
and the Poultry Improvement Asso
ciation will gather information as to
where eggs can be obtained in large
quantities by March and April. By
getting White Wyandotte eggs from
recognized breeders in 100 to 500
lots, it is believed they ean be gotten
at 50 to 75 cents a setting. Quota
tions of simile settings at $1.00 have
already been received by Agent
Casey. As now planned Mrs. Graves
expects to have the clubs going early
in Mai'cjii
Mr. CasGy is getting out a letter to
mail to the teachers and members
are already belngf enrolled for the
clubs. Names may be left with any
member of the Poultry Assoctation,
with Mr. Casey at the H. B. M. A., or
phoned to Mrs. Graves' residence
number.
Mr. Casey is not to be in charge of
this work, but he has already caught
the poultry fever and is going to Lex
ington in a few days to lecture on
poultry at a state meeting.

FROST BILL
KNOCKED OUT
State Senate Votes Down Sub
mission Act by 20
to 14.
HEATED DEBATE OF 41I0URS
Both Platforms Dad Declared
in Favor of The County
Unit.
Frankfort, Ky., Jan. 26. Gov.
Stanley's administration won a signal
victory yesterday when the senate,
by a vote of 20 to 14, defeated the
Frost bill for the submission of a con
stitutional amendment prohibiting
the manufacture and sale of intoxi
cating liquers. The outcome was a
surprise to "dry" adherents, who
had been outgeneraled by the opposi
tion. Action upon the measure followed
a debate of more than four hours,
marked by bitterness and recrimina
tion. Nearly every senator either
made a speech or gave an explana
tion of his vote, while some did both.
Ugly words volleyed across the cham
ber like machine gun fire on an Euro
pean battlefield.
Administration supporters denounc
ed ' dry" senators as politicians, hyp
ocrites, agitators and boltqrs. Dry
senators, in turn, accused the opposi
tion of taking a stand which would
wreck the party and turn Kentucky
over to the republicans. They resent
ed with heat the charge that they
were "bolting" the platform pledg
ing the party to the county unit.
When the smoke of battle had lifted,
the roll call showed tho following:
To Submit Antle, Frost, Glenn,
Hiles, Huntsman, Montgomery, Peak,
Porter, Salmon, Sanders, Scott, Tay
lor and Williams 14.
AgainstSubmission Arnott.Boolcs,
Brock, Clay, Combs, Helm, Hildreth,
Huffaker, Knight, Lewis, Leach, Lit-
trell, Moore, Overstreet, Raybroune,
Robertson, Speer, Stricklett Thomp
son and Trigg 20.
Those not voting: Ford, who is at
home, ill; Senator Rogers and Sena
tor Zimmerman.
The defeat of the measure, whose
prospects seemed rosy, may be at
tributed to the planks in both party
platforms indorsing the county unit
principle. This gave the administra
tion a whip to swing over the heads
of senators who placed party regular
ity ahead of their personal views on
the question. The result was that a
number of supposedly "dry" sena
tors, representing "dry" constituen
cies, voted against tiie bill.
Senator Frost declared that Lieu
tenant Governor Black, zealous pro
hibitionist, saved the democratic tick
et from humiliating defeat.
"It is to you and to you alone," he
averred, turning to the president of
the senate, "that we owe democratic
success last November, bocnuse it
was known from one end of the state
to the othor that you stood for state
wide legislation. Had you not been
on tliat ticket the democratic party
would have gone down into defeat at
the last election by 20,000 votes."
. TWO WILL COMPETE.
The oratorical contest for the cham
pionship of Western Kentucky schools
will be held at Madisonville Feb. 22.
So far as known, only two Hopkins
ville boys will contend for tho nonor
of representing the local High School.
Theso are Robert Brumfield and Ed
ward Breathitt. The date of the pre
liminary contest 1ms not been an
nounced. WEUHAK-SHERRILL

man of Pasadona, Calif. Tho infor
mation came in a letter to a friend
hero this week. Mrs. Shorrill moved

two years ago.
