RITISH possession of terri
tory protecting the Suez ca

periled by attacks made by large
bodies of Arabs and Turks on the
British forces In southwestern Ara
bia, according to German advices.
The British have been driven from
all the territory held in that sec

losses in the fighting, the reports
declared figures being given at
16,000 killed and 20.600 wounded.
A situation quite similar to this
was reported through German
agencies several weeks ago, but
London then officially announced
that no apprehensions were enter
tained of the outcome of the oper
ations. The Austrians, having secured
possession of virtually all of Mon
tenegro, its remaining defenders,
according to Vienna, are fast lay

connt the Bulgarian forces, co
operating with the Austrians had
encountered tlie Albanian troops
under Essad Pasha, and, ac
cording to official advisers, had
met with a defeat at the hands of
the latter.

BRNE. Switzerland. Jan. r
Switzerland, although strictly
neutral, economically suffers more
from the world-war than belligerent
Germany. Threatened with complete
isolation by England. France and Italy,
the little republic has been compelled
to give up all trade with the German
empire and Austria-Hungary.
The result of the orders issued by
the government is that more than half

Asserting that the foodstuffs, chemi

their way into Germany, the allies
have interfered with these Imports In
every possible way.
Foodstuffs Confiscated.
Shiploads of grain and flour from
America have been confiscated by the
British, although th fi-orlsa ,.,.
nient has explained that the wheat I
now brought from the United States
was formerly imported from Germany.
Grain and- flour have become so
scarce that the government is seri
icusly considering the introduction of
bread cards. The republic already has
"war bread" and rice, coffee and sugar
have become luxuries which can no
longer be obtained by the poorer
classes.
Food Trice High.
The meat prices are as high as in
Germany and in some places higher.
Butter costs 6 to 7S cents a pound
and cheese SO to 70 cents. For pota
toes, $1.50 to $1 75 a hundred pounds
is asked and eggs are not sold for
less than five cents apiece.
The stream of tourists which In time
of peace flows through Switzerland,
has been completely stopped and this
means a loss of many million dollars.
Some of the best known resorts are
closed and the proprietors of many
have failed.
Great Deficit Faced.
Since September. 1914, the income of
the government from the railroads and
other sources has been reduced nearly
40 percent while the expenditures
have increased enormously as a result
of the mobilisation of the entire army
for the protection of neutrallty
The expenses for this purpose al

USUI REFUSES
SUFFRAGE FLEI
New York. Jan. 2. President Wilson
refused toda to support the movement
for an amendment to the federal con
stitution providing for woman suffrage.
He spoke brieflv to 200 members of the
congressional union for woman suf
frage, telling them he felt the suffrage
question should be dealt with by in
dividual states.
President Wilson Is here today to ad
dress the Railroad Business associa
tion banquet tonight making his open
ing speech in his campaign for the pre
paredness program. He arrived this
morning from Washington and will re
turn to the capital tomorrow.
Won't lie Croni lxaniined.
The president received the suffrag
ists after they had sent him a series
of notes and had waited for him for
more than an hour at Waldorf-Astoria
hotel, which he made his headquarters.
Efforts made by Mrs, Mary Beard,
wife of a Columbia university professor,
to cross examine the president on his
position, met with failure. He refused
courteously to reply to her queries.
The president faced a program to
day calling for a reception by clergy
men, the delivery of addresses before
two business organizations, and the
probability that he would be inter
viewed by a delegation of German-Americans
who want him to persuade the
British government to permit the ship
ment of milk from America for babies
in Germany.
He was accompanied by Mrs. Wilson,
his secretarj. Joseph Tumulty, and Dr.

Essence of True Democracy
Legality of Selection How
ever, Rests with National
Executive Committee.
Austin, Texas, Jan. ST. The state
convention which meets In August
after the regular bi-annual Democratic
primary election, has the duty of elect
ing national committeemen, although
the national executive committee has
authority and power to pass upon the
legality of the selection. The state
executive committee would not have
authority to make the selection. The
state executive committee is request
ed to submit to the various county
chairmen the names of candidates for
delegates at large and cannot select
the names to be certified to the county
cnatrman.
Primary Law Valid.
The presidential preferential primary
law. passed by the legislature in 1912
is constitutional. It Is unnecessary
after the holding of such a primary to
hold a state convention for the pur
pose of .declaring the result of such,
primaries.
It would not be proper for the names
of the members of the state legislature
committee to be voted on at the so
called presidential preferential pri
mary In May.
The names of the delegates from the
state at large are the only names to
be submitted as delegates by the state
executive committee to the county
chairmen, returns of such primary
election should be made in same man
ner as returns at the regular primary
election in July.
This is a synopsis of an Important
election law construction, made by at
