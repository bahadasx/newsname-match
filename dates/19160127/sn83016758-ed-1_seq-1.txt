i
LOSE CLOSE CONTEST
Locals Are Defeated by Ascension
Cubs in a Sensational Ex-
hibition at the Armory.
Sandstone Downs Princeton High
School Friday EveningDouble
Header Tomorrow Evening.
After one of the closest, scrappiest
and most tense games ever staged on
the local Armory floor, Co. G's basket
ball tossers took the referee's count
Thursday evening, but not until they
had forced their opponentsthe As
cension Cubs of Minneapolisto trav
el on high all the way to win. And at
that if a couple of questionable de
cisions at critical periods made by the
visitors' referee had be.en eliminated
in all probability the locals would have
hung the long end of the score safely
out of reach of their opponents.
The final count was 29 to 25, and
that just about tells the story of the
game. I twas a case of Greek vs.
Greek, and the largest crowd of the
season was on hand to witness the
thrilling contest.
The Cubs started with a flourish.
They negotiated three baskets right
off the reel, and a dense gloom settled
over the local enthusiasts for a brief
stay. Co. finally adjusted the car
buretor of its scoring machine, how
ever, and from then until the time
keeper's whistle sounded there was
action galore. Smith wafted the
sphere through the net a couple of
times, and then Morton evened up the
score by tossing a basket. The Cubs
took the lead again when Pouliot,
their accurate right forward, shot the
ball through the net, but only held it
a short time. Newton got within
range of the basket twiee, and counted
each time. G's lead was increased
when Morton negotiated a goal, and
then Doane added to the enthusiasm
of local followers by gently propel
ling the ball through the net. Before
the period was over the yisitors nego
tiated two more baskets, but Co had
the advantage of a 15 to 13 count
when time was called. Smith for
Princeton, and Van De Mark for the
Ascensions, each threw afoul during
iSxis round.
The second half was even more ex
citing than the first, and at times the
referee's whistle was drowned by the
vocal enthusiasm of the crowd. Dur
ing the final minutes of play Morton
went in as left forward, giving his
place as guard to Maggart.
Morton started the scoring in this
round by throwing a basket during
the first few minutes of play, and the
visitors counted twice snortly there
after. Honors were even again when
Wilkes planted the ball through the
loop, but then the Princeton defense
collapsed temporarily, and the visitors
negotiated six baskets before the mi
litia boys took a brace. At this stage
of the game the score stood 19 to 29
in favor of the Cubs, and it began to
appear as if the team was due to
be annihilated. Doane revived the
hopes of the locals by penetrating the
Ascension defense for a basket, and
when Maggart followed suit the en
thusiasm of the spectators knew no
bounds. Doane again broke down the
defense of the opposition, and the vis
itors appeared to be slightly worried.
The count now stood 29 to 25, and it
was not changed during the" final min
utes. By stalling, and devoting all
their energies toward a defensive
game the visitors managed to retain
\th is lead to.the end.
NOTES.
"Pongo" Olson refereed the first
lialf, and as usual performed the ar
duous duties in a manner that would
do credit to a professional. Raidt of
Minneapolis took Tom's place during
the final period, and did well, al
though at time3 his eyesight was none
too keen.
Smith threw ai basket during the
last half that won the plaudits of the
audience, being thrown from a par
ticularly difficult angle. I didn't
count, however, owing to some tech
nicality known only to the-referee.
Barrett, who went in as center for
the visitors during the last half, saved
the day for the down river athletes.
He threw two baskets from the center
of the floor, and came so near to nego
tiating a third as to cause heart pal
pitation among the nervous ones pres
ent. Verily, his accuracy was un
canny.
I is doubtful if two teams more
evenly matched could be picked any
where, and if they oppose each other
again the contest will be worth trav
eling miles to witness.
Pouliot negotiated a total of seven
v,_
baskest for the visitors, which is go
ing some.
Although defeated Co. has reason
to feel proud of its performance. The
boys played a clean and snappy game,
and" gave a good account of them
selves.
i Princeton H. S. Defeated.
The speedy and powerful Sandstone
high school basket ball team took the
representatives of the Princeton school
into camp Friday evening to the tune
of 33 to 9. The contest was staged at
Sandstone, and the outcome was not
surprising, as the Quarry City has a
husky aggregation of veterans, who
have played together since the days
when northern Pine country was a
wilderness.
A detailed account of the game can
not be given, as the locals also lost
their score book. The contest started
out like a real game, however, and each
side scored a basket shortly after play
started. Then for several minutes the
two quints battled on even terms,
neither side succeeding in penetrating
the defense of the opposition. Finally
the weight and superior team work
of the Pine county athletes battered
down the Princeton defense, and the
quarrymen forged into the lead. When
time was called the count stood 17 to
7 in favor of Sandstone.
During the second half the offensive
formations of the orange and black
did not bring desired results, and two
free throws represented the sum total
of the scoring efforts of the Princeton
basket ball tossers. In the meantime
the Sandstone players rolled up a to
tal of 16 points.
NOTES.
The locals speak very highly of the
treatment accorded them by the hos
pitable people of Sandstone. The ref
eree was absolutely impartial, and the
opposing players were clean and
sportsmanslike.
While defeated the Princeton lads
have no reason to feel disheartened.
Considering the fact that the quint is
composed almost entirely of players
absolutely without experience until
this season, the team has done very
well.
The two forwards on the Sandstone
team have been playing basket ball
the past five"y*ars, and the other mem
bers of the quint are veterans. The
team is not only heavy^TSuTold and ex
perienced, and a victory for Princeton
would have been little short of a mira
cle.
Tomorrow night the locals will en
deavor, to put in crimp in the winning
streak of the Mora high school, and
bid fair to succeed. Both Mora and
Princeton havejbeen defeated by Sand
stone, and both have a win to their
credit over Elk River. The contest
should be a hummer. The girl teams
of the two schools will also oppose
each other, and an athletic treat is in
store for those who attend. The pro
ceedings will be enlivened by strains
of music furnished by the high school
orchestra. State Federation of Farmers' Clubs.
A state federation of farmers' clubs,
bearing the name "Federation of Min
nesota Farmers' Clubs," was organized
during Farmers' and Home-Makers'
Week at University Farm, St. Paul.
Representatives of practically every
county in the state and of more than
200 farmers' clubs participated in the
meeting at which the organization was
effected.
The aim of the new organization is
broad and promises much for the rural
life of the state. Something of the
scope of the work before the federa
tion may seen from the following ex
tracts from its constitution:
"The object of this federation is to
develop better agricultural methods in
Minnesota, and to foster and promote
social educational, and business inter
ests beneficially connected with such
developments as rural credits, buying,
selling, legislation, etc. It shall serve,
not dominate, the local clubs^and shall
encourage and promote, not transact,
co-operative business. It shall act as
a bureau of service, affording means
for the interchange of ideas for facili
tating local endeavor, and for securing
ends which may be of benefit to the
farmers of the state at large.
"The active membership of the fed
eration shall consist exclusively of ac
tive farmers and farm home-makers,
not engaged in any other business,
chosen as delegates, one for one year
and another for two years, and there
after one each year for two years,
from each county of the state in which
there are farmers' clubs. j&
"The officers of this federation shall
be a president, a vice-president, a sec
retary, and a treasurer, and a board
of directors composed of these officers,
excepting the secretary, and one mem
ber from each congressional district*

Mrs. David Wetter.
Mrs. David Wetter, an esteemed
resident of Princeton town, answered
the final summons at Jones hospital
Minneapolis, Friday, January 21, after
a short illness.
Funeral services were conducted at
the Methodist church yesterday and
the attendance was so large as to am
ply attest to the esteem in which de
ceased was held. Rev. E. B. Service
officiated, and the Methodist quartet
sang touching selections. Two broth
ers and four sons of Mrs. Wetter acted
as pall bearers. Interment was in Oak

died. Besides the husband and six
children,-deceased isN survived*4jy her
parents, Mr. and Mrs. Carl Block, two
brothers and one sister.
Mrs. Wetter was a member of the
Evangelican German church. A Chris
tian from youth her life was pre
eminently one of submission and faith.
As a mother, wife and neighbor she
was ever kindly, considerate and true
and her untimely demise is indeed re
grettable.
Mr. Wetter takes this means to ex
press his sincere appreciation to all
who extended sympathy and aid to
him during his recent bereavement.
Laid at Rest.
The last sad rites over all that was
mortal of the late Mrs. Harriet E.

in a profusion of beautiful floral
tributes.
Rev. E. B. Service delivered the
funeral sermon, and a quartet com
posed of Messrs Guy Ewing and Ar
thur Roos and Mesdames E. B. Ser
vice and C. A. Caley sang several
beautiful selections.
The pall bearers were William,
George, Thomas and Robert Neely, E.
E. Whitney and R. E. Willard, and in
terment was in Oak Knoll cemetery.
Another Drop in Prices.
The potato movement has been
exceedingly brisk in Princeton from the
time the last issue of the Union
went to press up to Tuesday, although
prices have been decreasing Buy
ers estimate that on Thursday, Friday,
Saturday and Monday approximately
2,000 loads of spuds were marketed
here. Friday was the heaviest day,
and the buyers experienced some diffi
culty in caring for the receipts.
The outside market dropped 10c on
Tuesday, and the local, market is from
5c to 8c lower than last week.
The outside demand for potatoes
continues good, and shipments fron
this point have been extremely heavy
the past week. A total of 83 carloads
having left here since the last issue of
the Union. On Saturday 38 cars left
the Princeton depot, and on Tuesday 27
were shipped. oday 18 cars will leave

s- Shows Gratifying Increase
Over Last Year.
The. annual meeting of the Princeton
Co-operative Creamery association was
held at the Armory Tuesday afternoon,
and numerous shareholders and pat
rons were in attendance.

Meyer. The minutes of the last meet
ing were read by Secretary Louis
Rocheford, and same were approved.
That the Princeton creamery is in a
flourishing condition, and that its bus
iness/is constantly increasing in vol
ume, was shown by the reading of the
secretary's annual report. During
1915 an average price of 29.7^ was paid
per pound for butterfat to regular pat
rons. The creamery received a total
of 254,935 pounds of butterfat during

George Schmidt, one of thershare
holders, asked what benefitthe cream
ery had derived from purchasing $475
worth of stock in the Minnesota Co
operative Dairies association. Mana
ger Warner explained that increased
prices received* for butter more than
offset the expenditure.:: &-*#"
Letters were received from two com
mission houses relative to pasteurizing,
the cream before same is, churned,
The demand for butter made from pas
teurized cream is increasing. Upon
motion it was decided to leave the mat
ter to the board of directors, as vari
ous changes must be considered in this
connection. Pasteurization would mean
that a new contract with the Water,
~%m
steam and power. The present "con
tract with the commisssion is effective
another year, but as it calls for the pay
ment of a flatTate of $350 per year for
steam and power, if additional power
is to be had new terms must be agreed
upon.
The commission submitted a proposi
tion to supply steam at a flat rate of
$150 per year, and electricity at a
rate of 8c per kilowat. The share
holders expressed the opinion that in
view of the fact the creamery con
sumes considerable electricity during
the summer season, and the bulk of it
in the day time, when the load on the
power plant is light, better terms
should be offered them. The matter
was left to the directors, who will as
certain if the creamery can operate
its steam engine at a cost less than
that asked for electricity, and act ac
cordingly.
President Meyers then urged that
all patrons become shareholders in the
creamery, stating that it was riot a
certainty that dividends would be vot
ed to non-shareholders in the future.
The election of directors was next
considered, .and upon motion duly
made and seconded the old board was
unanimously re-elected, viz: Aug. F.
Meyer, H. C. Nelson, Louis Rocheford,
John_Dalchow and D. L. Clough.t The
directors have attended to their duties
in a commendable manner, and the
prosperous condition of the creamery
is ample evidence of their worth and
ability.
The proposition of discontinuing the
payment of interest to shareholders
was brought up, but after a brief dis
cussion the matter was dropped.
No further business coming up for
the meeting, it adjourned, and those
present accepted an invitation extend
ed on behalf of Max Kruscke by Geo.
Schmidt to attend a free show at the
Crystal theatre.
The Union has been requested by the
creamery management to thank-the
militia company for the usev of the
armory, and Mr. Kruscke for the
free show.
West Branch Creamery Meeting.
The West Branch Co operative
Creamery company held its annual
meeting at the school house of district
No. 4, Saturday afternoon. Much in
terest was manifested in the proceed
&s Jay numerous shareholders and
patrons in attendance.
The secretary's report which was
read and accepted indicates that the
creamery is doing a satisfactory busi
nes and is prospering. It is estimated
that the creamery purchases the pro
duct of 850 cows, and it has a total of
190 hand-separator patrons. The re

Base Ball Prospects.
The annual January thaw which
visited this vicinity the latter part of
last week, and the first of this revived
base ball talk in the village, and ar
rangements are now under way to
have Princeton represented on the
diamond by a winning team during
the 1916 season.
Princeton had a particularly strong
nine in the field last season, and all
but two of the* stars will be in line
again this year. Emahiser having
left will not be available, and we are
informed that Jesmer will not be
here the coming summer. Both will
be missed, but there is no real scarc
ity of available material.
The players will be provided with
new uniforms this season, each of the
following firms having promised to
donate one for the privilege of having
an advertisement thereon: Mcllhar
gey Hardware & Furniture Co.,
Pierson & Blocker, Princeton Auto
Co., G, Hofflander, McMillan & Stan
ley, J. H. Hoffman, C. H. Nelson.
Evens Hardware Co., A. E. Allen &
Co., Earley & Evans, Orton & Kaliher,
and the Caley.Hardware Co.
The directors and players ha an |1|
informal meeting at the residence of ll|p
Mr. and Mrs. S. P. Skahen Monday i
evening, and plans for 1916 were~di&u_
cussed at length. Treasurer Oster- 3|
berg read the financial statement, and
same was unanimously accepted.
There is a cash balance of $80 in the
treasury. The colors of the new uni
forms were decided, upon, and they
will be white trimmed with blue, a
neat combination. Within two weeks
a banquet will be held, and the gen
eral public is invited. The nominal
price of 50c per plate will be Charged.
The boys appreciate the generous
support of the public, and will again
endeavor to give Princeton fans a fast
article .of ball when.the 19X6 seaso*-^L
is launched. ^S till
