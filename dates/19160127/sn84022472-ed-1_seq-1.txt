GRANDCHILDREN
TO BATTLE FOR
DUNNESTATE
Milkman Left Fortune From
Sale of Sites to TJ. M. C.
Plant.
SON'S WIDOW TAKES
PRELIMINARY STEPS
Contends That Late Hus
band Laid Foundation of
Dunn Fortune.
Distribution of the fortune of Wil-'
liam Dunn, for many years owner of
land now occupied by the Union Me
tallic Cartridge Co.'s new munition
plants along Seaview avenue, -will be
the object of a legal battle in the pro
bate court here. "
As a preliminary step, Mrs. Anna
Dunn of Shelton has . applied to the
probate court of this city to be made
guardian of her three children, Anna
W., . John and Margaret Dunn. She
is the widow of John F. Dunn, the eld
est son of William Dunn. -
William Dunn died shortly after
New Tear's day, and within a few
months of the final sale of properties
to the Remington interests by which
he became Independently wealthy.
The late William Dunn was a milk
man and farmer and one of the old
est "and most widely known residents
of West Stratford. The Dunm
homestead faced to the east fn Sea
view avenue near Boston avenue and
north of the homestead was an ap
ple orchard and still farther north a
cow pasture. j
When John F. Dunn, married Anna
Costello, who is now, on behalf of her
children, preparing to contest their
grandfather's will, the' Dunn family
did not look with favor ontthe match
and it was some time before a recon
ciliation was effected between the
bride and the members of the family.
In the meantime John TP'. Dunn and
his bride went to live in a pouae
that he had helped his. father to
build. v
John aided his father in the milk
business and also directed a trucking
and moving business which his father
carried on in the East End. ' While
carrying on 'this business as" an em
ploye, rather than a partner, he died.
His widow, shortly afterward, took her
children,- Anna W., John and Mar
garet :Dunn and - went ..tor - Shelton - to,
live. ; It wis . understood that on the
ground that these children are en
titled to share in their grandfather's
estate because of the work perform
ed toy their father, that suit will be
brought. . , - f
Tfi his will, which Is a very brief
document, Mr. Dunn left all he pos
sessed to his widow, Margaret .Dunn.
The will was drawn by Attorney
James. H. O'Rourke and is one of
the most terse documents ever sub
mitted for probate here. The will is
so clear in its diction that lawyers
who have seen it scout the idea that,
by any legal process, it -may be set
aside as defective.
It ts estimated Mr. Dunn possessed
property , in Ogden street extension
and cash in banks totalling at least
$40,000. The Dunn property extend
ed from just above Ivy street, on the
west side of Seaview avenue, to Bos
ton avenue, and there were several
other parcels on the same side of
the street below Ivy street. Mr. Dunn
for many yearscarried on a milk and
trucking business in the East End.
With the shrewd foresight by which
he procured the property he weighed
the advances made to him by agents
of the Remington Arms &' Ammuni
tion Co. before disposing of his hold
ings. When Charles Beach, who
bought many acres of land in ' the
East End for that company approach
ed him, - Mr. j)unn decided to await
developments. Mr. Beach ' also had
been a milk seller? a wood seller and
an iceman in the East End. Mr.
Dunn knew 1 here was something
more than a transfer to Beach if the
deal went .through. 1 1 ; '
Some of the- property, which had
been the apple orchard and the cow
pasture, stood in the names of his
daughters,' Margaret and Nellie Dunn,
and their father -advised them to
wait. -
The price' he finally obtained for the
property, which is -now ' owned by
the Remington Arms and Ammunition
Co. and on which some of the factory
buildings -now stand, marks a record
for increase "in real estate valuations
in this fcity and particularly for the
rise in values in real estate in that
part of the city.
It is believed that Mr. Dunn's
daughter-in-law will set up the claim
that her husband aided in establishing
the property in Seaview avenue; that
while Margaret and Nellie also aided,
they received their share because part
of the property was placed in their
names and they later sold to advan
tage. As. for former Alderman Wil
liam Durin it will be claimed that
some time ago he received any share
in the estate he might be entitled to.
Former Alderman Dunn conducted a
confectionery and news business now
carried on by William G. Wotten in
Seaview avenue. Afterward Alder
man Dunn bought the grocery store
and postofflce of old West Stratford.
Attorney Thomas C. . Coughlin is
counsel for Mrs. Dunn and her chil
dren. Attorney Thomas M. Cullinan
has been retained by Margaret, Nellie
and William Dunn, children of the de
ceased. VATICAN REPORTS

MACHINISTS TO
INSTITUTE LONG
DRIVE IN WEEK
Preliminary Campaign For
8-Hour Day All Ready
For Start. .
CIRCUIT SPEAKERS
NAMED FOR WORK
Bridgeport's Labor Defense
Fund Accumulates For
Expected Use.
George J. Bowen, business agent of
the International Association of Ma
chinists, Local No. 30. announced to
day that the general campaign for an
eight-hour day will have its beginning
in Bridgeport next week.
.Ten circuit speakers will tour Con
necticut, Massachusetts andRhode Is
land, and the first will appear here
within a few days. Meetings will be
held, once a Week all winter. -
The purpose' is to educate the ma
chinists concerning what has been obi
tained here, what may be obtained
and what unionism stands f or. ' It is
merely a preparatory campaign,, for
the spring drive that is expected . to
convert all Bridgeport manufacturers
engaged in machine work.
"The Labor Defense Fund will be
ready by spring, when it will be used
to protect the workingmen j from
abuses such as they suffered last summer.-
',
The machinists expect to raise more
than $500 for the Danbury hatters. In
conjunction with organized i labor
throughout the United States, Bridge
port unions are selliner tasrs for one
hour's p"ay, to union members.' The
equivalent of the hour's labor in cash
will go into a fund being raised by
the Federation of Labor for the relief
of the 180 defendants in the famous
suit of D. E. Loewe et a.1. vs. Martin
Lawler et al., which reached its final
stage in the district court ; here last
week when a writ was issued for the
sale of the ' property taken under at
tachment in, the boycott suit. There
are 155 parcels of property, mostly
the, modest little homes of the men
who were named among the defend
ants. - '
Counsel for the hatters' obtained the
privilege of having each piece of real
estate sold separately on the premises
instead of in bulk 'at an auctioneer's
block in the county court house. -The
homes taken on foreclosure are in
Danbury, Bethel and Norwalk. r.
On Jan. 8, in conformity with ; a
vote, of the American Federation of
Labor ' convention held . in San Fran
cisco Irecently, President Samuel
Gompers issued an appeal to organiz
ed labor in this form:
"Will you give an hour of'your la
bor in a righteous cause on Hatters'
Day, Jan. 2 7, 1916?"
Molders and coremakers of Bridge
port, backed by their international as
sociation, will begin a campaign Mon
day for a minimum -wage. .
Core Makers and ,.
Molders To Demand
Minimum Day's Pay
A meeting of molders , and core
makers will be held Monday evening
in the United Irish Societies' hall,
Main and State, streets, and arrange
ments will be made for a. general con
ference with manufacturers through
out the city. "
Fourteen factories, one of which is
in Fairfield, will ' be affected. The
minimum to be asked is $3.50 for a
nine-hour day. ,
J. R. ' O'Leary, president of the In
ternational Association of Iron Mold
ers of North America, has come to
this city and will address the meeting
Monday evening. He probably will
seek 'audiences with the manufacturr
ers next week. Mr. O'Leary said to
day: "The sentiment among the men
In Bridgeport is that they want a
minimum wage of $3.50. Some of
them are receiving less than that.
"The - campaign will be short. It
will take only a week to learn
whether or not we'll g-et it. If we
don't, of course, the men don't have to
wbrk.
"The International pays strike
benefits, whether you've been in the
union 20 years or 20 minutes. We
don't expect much opposition to the
plan because the molding Industry in
the United States is more prosperous
than it ever has been."
The women of the city working as
coremakers, against whose treatment
many i protests were made last sum
mer, will not be affected, as the union
deesnft admit women. The union op
is opposed to the employment of
women in such heavy work.

BIG FUND READY
FOR NEW NORTH
CHURCH BUILDING
; "
Congregational Leaders Here
Pledge $80,000 For United
Churches.
CAN'T SELL NORTH
CHURCH PROPERTY
South and North Churches
to Meet Next Week to
Ratify Committee's Work
That 80,000 has been pledged by
members of the North and South Con
gregational churches, to be used for
the construction of a modern edifice
on the site of the North church, be
came known today. V
Members of the two church"
have separate meetings on next w ed
nesday night, .when it is expected that
the work of the. joint . committee of
the two churches will be ratified. Th
committee has agreed upon plans for
the consolidation of the two churches
and the rebuilding of the North
church.
The plans of the leaders in the con
solidation movement, to sell both
church properties and to rear a mod
ern edifice upon a location not so
near the business center have been
hampered by the discovery that the
North church property is held under a
deed which provides that if it should
be used, for any but church purposes,
it shall revert to heirs of. the original
owner. " Realty experts who viewed
the property for the, church people
valued it at $90,000.
With the . umfsuall if generous
pledges already received,- enthusiastic
churchmen predict that that fund, ex
clusive of .the money from the sale
of th&-South church property, will be
$150,000. .
- The committee's report, it is un
derstood, does not take up . the ques
tion, of the pastorate.

patched it by the manager "of the ho-
tel. The suffragists told the Presi-;
dent they did not wish him to ad-:
dress them but they did want to "tell:
him some things"- about "the Susan B. ;
Anthony amendment bill now before ,
Congress' ' 'Again the reply was in
the negative. , '
Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont, on- of the
prominent suffrage leaders, was then
'called on the telephone and asked to j
direct the next move. . Twice she '
dictated notes which' the manager1 was ;
prevailed upon to deliver at the Presi-;
dential suite. : . '
Between two of the manager's trips
as a messenger, Mrs. Mary Beard,- wife
of a professor at Columbia University,
urged the delegation to- remain in the
hotel in an effort to see the' Presi-'
dent and request him to advocate suf
frage. ' . '
'Suffrage is - ever so much more
important than preparedness," said:
the speaker. It was not until he had':
replied to four notes that the Presi-1
dent agreed to meet the suffragists,!
saying he had concluded his speech j
preparation before he had expected :
to.
The President addressed the delega- .
tion briefly. He declined to support !
the movement for an amendment to !
the Federal constitution providing for '
woman suffrage, saying that he felt j
that the suffrage question should be i
dealt with by each individual state. J
, Efforts made by5 Mrs. Mary Beard j
to cross-examine the President on hisj
opinion met with failure. He refused I
courteously to reply to her questions.
The President apologized to the
women for not seeing them earlier, j
but told them he had been at work j
since arriving in New York. He
added that "it may be that my mind
works ' slowly, but I have always j
thought that there were things which
should be built slowly and therefore i
made more lasting. I "may be a little!
old fashion in ,my view that the suf-i
frage question should be handled by
the -states." I
The President frankly admitted to;
the surrragettes tnat ne naa promisea
several months ago to discuss with
leaders of Congress the suffrage ques
tion, but other matters of legislation,,
he said, had come up which " he !
thought demanded preference. J j
"There are things that cannot wait," j
said the President. "Action on great j
constitutional matters must be delib- j
erate."
President Wilson arrived here at 6 j
a. m. today, to face a program calling:
for a reception by clergymen, the de- J
livery of addresses before two business
organizations and the probability that j
he would be interviewed by a delega-
tion ofx German-Americans who wantj
him to persuade the British govern-1
ment to permit the shipment of milk j
from America for babies in Germany.
He was accompanied by Mrs. Wil-,
son, his secretary, Joseph Tumulty, ;
and Dr. Cary T. Grayson. The party j
remained on board . the train in the ;
Pennsylvania station until 8 a. m.
when 'a committee from the Railroad,
Business k association arrived to escort j
them to the Waldorf-Astoria hotel.
