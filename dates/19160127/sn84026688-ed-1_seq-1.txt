"Mr. Hazard, wail! I want to speak
with you."
Felix Hazard had just descended the
"L” steps at Fifth avenue and Madison
street, and was hurrying to his office
at the Sutherland Detective agency, to
take up the labors of the day, when
his r ;eps were arrested by a soft femi
nine voice. He stopped instantly, and
not without some surprise wheeled
round and met the speaker's anxious
look. He knew the voice.
"Certainly, Helen," he agreed. "You
sound mighty serious.”
The two drew closer together and
moved under the steps away from the
jostling sidewalk throng.
Nominally, Helen Hertel was a ste
nographer at the Sutherland offices;
hut, besides being a strikingly pretty
girl with a Dlanalike length of limb
and litheness, she had on more than
one occasion, when asked to meet an
emergency, shown a capability and
adaptability that p aced her in the
rank with the company's best opera
tives. Accordingly, she drew an oper
ative’s salary.
Felix Hazard and Helen Bertel were
good friends. Indeed, it was hard
sometimes for the man to smother the
warm glow that was wont to leap into
his eyes at sight of her; he made no
attempt to bide bis admiration, how
ever.
The girl smiled faintly.
"Perhaps It is serious,” she returned.
"Anyhow, it’s awfully queer—what I
want to see you about. I’m glad we
met here instead of having to wait till
we got to the office.
"Last night, as maybe you remem
ber, was beautiful —a full moon—and
I was out lots later than I should have
been, alone in my canoe, and I went
out into Hie lake lota farther than I
should have gone. ... I had an ad
venture.”
Her tine gray eyes were dancing
with suppressed excitement.
"in the middle of file lake?” Hazard
inquired.
“Goodness, no! But I was far
enough off shore to make it very
strange and mysterious. The moon
glare was behind me at the time, and
once when 1 looked back I saw a row
boat. It was white —like a shell of
alabaster on a path of cold silver fire.”
Felix Hazard smiled whimsically and
remarked:
“The moon’s influence still lingers,
1 see. What a queer girl you are!”
She made a little mouth at him and
jvent on:
"It was empty, or 1 thought it wae;
one doesn’t find empty skiffs floating
on the lake every night, you know;
and of course 1 turned and paddled
straight to where it was.
"Well, it wasn't empty. A man lay
unconscious in the bottom, his white
face turned up ghostly to the moon,
t thought he was dead; but even while
1 was holding the two boats together
and peering down at him, he opened
his eyes and looked up at me.
“It was funny! To save my life
I couldn't think of a word to say!
We just stared at each other like two
ninnies for all of a minute. Then he
all at once sat up and groaned. He
caught at his head with both hands
and toppled forward over one of the
thwarts.
“1 knew then that he had been hurt,
and I got busy. Would you believe it?
He hadn’t the slightest idea how he
got injured, or how he happened to
be out on the lake in a rowboat at
nearly midnight.
"By this time I was making mental
note of everything. He had an un
buttoned appearance, if you know what
1 mean —shirt unfastened, shoes un
laced; his collar and tie were lying on
the grating, and his hat wae missing
utterly. Also he didn’t have an oar
to his name.
“He was too weak to help much, and
there wasn't another boat in sight any
where—just us two away out in the
silent, moonlit lake. 1 tied my canoe
to the boat and towed it back to the
beach; not so easy to do with only a
single paddle.”
Hazard was Intensely interested, not
alone because the episode was unusual
in itself, but also because he knew
that Helen Bertel would not he telling
him about it with so much detail If
she were not moved by some under
lying purpose.
"Welt,” he prompted her, “what's
the answer?”
“Why, on the way to land f made
another discovery-several of them
to tell the truth. He is a young man

bearing all the countless little marks
of breeding and refinement that a girl
can't mistake. Yet somehow it im
pressed me that he was not dressed
for tiie part; hie clothes were good,
correct as to style, but they had not
been chosen by him. They clashed
with his personality—do you know
what I'm trying to say?"
"1 understand. Somebody had ex
changed clothing with him—either to
hide the victim’s identity, to set the
police on a false scent, or for the
more simple motive that your chap's
suit was better than his assailant's.”
“That in it. The young man had re
covered his senses, but remained si
lent. He kept watching me with a
puzzled expression, as if he felt he
ought to know me but couldn't recall
my name or where we had met. In
deed, everything he looked at—even
his hands, the lake, the boat, the moon
—all seemed strange to him.
“'What is your name?’ 1 asked him
“‘Name?’ he repeated, looking more
puzzled than ever. And what do you
think? —he didn't know!
"1 soon realized that I had a charge
that was as helpless and dependent as
a little child. Fancy! It wae nearly
midnight, too!”
“What did you do with him?”
The girl colored, but answered
steadily:
"Why, just what 1 thought you or
any gentleman would have done un
der the circumstances, 1 lelt a re
sponsibility. When 1 saw how help
less he was I went through his pock
ets. And he let me proceed as if it
were quite the proper tiling to do;
just watched me in a bewildered sort
of fashion. All T found was some en
velopes and a postcard. . . . Did
you ever hear of 'Denver Ed’ Haw
lings?”
"The yegg? Don’t ask foolish ques
tions."
"Well, the envelopes and the post-

card were all addressed to Edward S.
Rawlings—‘Denver Ed.’ ”
Felix Hazard relaxed from his at
tentive attitude, seeming all at once
to lose interest. He said in an indif
ferent tone:
"I suppose you turned him over to
the nearest copper?”
The gray eyes flashed, and she re
torted warmly:
"1 did nothing of the kind! He’s
no more ‘Denver Ed’ than 1 am, but a
handsome young man who needs pro
tection and care as much as any baby
ever did Why, I had to take him by
the hand and lend him! 1 took him
to a rooming house that I know of,
and paid for a night’s lodging for him.
The landlady’s a friend of mine; she
promised to keep an eye on him un
til —until—”
"Until what?”
“Until you came.”
■ I.
It was not merely that the girl who
asked him to go with tier happened to
be Helen Bertel that Felix Hazard
readily consented to do so, but, more
over, because he had confidence In
her sharpness and common sense, and
felt that he was not sidetracking busi
ness of moment in Heeding anything
brought by her to his notice. In a few
minutes they entered a typical West
side rooming house on a busy street,
and were going through an unusual
form of introduction, inasmuch as Misa
A Family Newspaper—lndependent in Politics—Devoted to Literature, Local and General News.
Bertel could observe the customary
ceremony 110 further than to murmur
Hazard’s name, and leave it to the
other to identify himself as beat he
could.
The waif, however, was by now per
fectly self-possessed. Miss Bertel had
felt justified in acquainting him with
all the circumstances. He realized hie
predicament, and was not without a
theory to account for it—one which
showed that he was neither unintelli
gent nor wholly unread.
He was a fine-appearing man of per
haps thirty, and of a pleasing person
ality and address.
"I have been mulling the whole
thing over,” said lie. "and have come
to several conclusions which may or
may not be helpful.
"First of all"—with an admiring,
grateful, but withal respectful glance
at the girl—“l know that I’m deucedly
lucky to have fallen info such consid
erate hands in my present plight.
‘‘l’ve forgotten everything about my
self up to Hie time I saw Miss Bertel
looking down at me. 1 suppose I was
hit over the head—knocked down and
out—and that the blow has destroyed
my memory. You can’t imagine how
horrible it is to realize sucli a slate.
I have only a confoundedly sore bump
to show for whatever adventures I
may have passed through,
”1 do know, though, that I’m not the
crook the envelopes in my pocket
seem to show 1 am. I’ve given that
phase of the matter more thought
than any other. It is possible, of
course, that tin* blow that brought me
to this state also knocked all the
crooked kinks out of my character;
I’ve heard of inherent depravity being
cuied by cranial operations; but some
how with me 1 can’t believe such to
be the ease. All my Instincts and in
clinations revolt at the very idea of
gross wrongdoing or lawbreaking. 1
feel that 1 have always been used to
an atmosphere and surroundings radi
cally different from those Implied by
Miss Bertel’s description of the Raw
lings type. 1 feel that I—l—it’s hard
to say, but 1 mean that I’m positive
that I’ve been accustomed to an en
vironment that would be strange to
this ‘Denver Ed’ ad his friends. ’
While the young man wae speaking
Felix Hazard had been watching him
intently. He now nodded thoughtfully,
adding:
"For your peace of mind I can as
sure you that, whoever else you may
be, you are not ’Denver Ed Rawlings.
I have some acquaintance with the
gentlemen, and I know. Let me have
those envelopes and the card.”
■ The young man promptly handed
them over. All bore canceled stamps
and were addressed to Rawlings, in
the same hand, at Louisville, Ky„ gen
eral delivery. In addition to the ad
dress the card bore only one written
line;
"July 2, 9 p. m. Same old place.”
“July second,” observed Hazard,
“was last Thursday.” He fell into a
brown study, while his fingers playrd
with the empty envelopes and the
postcard At last he roused himself
and said:
"1 am inclined to believe all you
have said, Mr. —"
the pause fell flatly; the air of ex
pectant waiting was natural and per
suasive. The wait s features lighted
up. and it seemed for an instant as
If he were about to supply the name;
but at once the light died away, and
the good-looking features clouded over
with a shadow of melancholy.
"it’s no use,” said the young man,
“I can’t remember."
"You very nearly did,” Hazard en
couraged; "you will, too, in time.
Keep trying. Fasten on to any flash
of memory—any little detail, however
fragmentary—and it will serve with
our help to rend the veil from your
past. Only have patience; amnesia
is by no means uncommon,
"Now, 1 want to ask yon to come
with ns; Mias Bertel and 1 have to get
to our place of business. It may he
that you are luckier than you imag
ined; for we both happen to be In
the employ of the Sutherland Detec
tive agency—”
"Sutherland!” the other interjected.
“I’ve heard that name!”
“Can you recall any dealings that
you ever had with us in the past?”
The man seemed to concentrate all
faculties on the effort of remember
ing; but in the end he shook his
head dejectedly,
"No, nothing. It was only a flash;
there is no association of ideas what
ever.”
"1 was about to add.” Hazard pur
sued. "that out of common humanity,
if for no other reason, 1 would help
you; but there is another reason, and
after Tve had time to turn the mat
ter over in my mind wo shall see
what can be done.”
The unknown offered no objections
to going with them, and as they pro
gressed downtown Felix Hazard
watched him narrowly. Only once
did the detective address him directly.
"Chicago is not wholly unknown to
you, 1 see.”
The man turned to him eagerly.
"By George! You’ve hit upon one
clear, definite impression that I have.
Somehow it seems as though I’d know
my way about town alone; yet l have
a feeling that Chicago is not where
I belong. If 1 were in my home town
I’m confident that places and street
names would be familiar —not merely
like a printed page that has been once
read, but like one that 1 see every
day."
They left their unfortunate charge
in a comfortable waiting room, while
Hazard and the girl repaired to his
private office.
"Sit down, Helen,” Hazard invited,
"anil let’s go over this thing together.”
"Doesn’t it strike you as being odd
that this poor chap should have had
four empty envelopes in his pocket,
not one of them containing a scrap of
the original letters?”
“1 hadn’t thought of it before," the
girl replied, "hut tlsey were placed
there purposely.”
“Left there purposely,” Hazard cor
rected. ’Those are Rawlings’ clothes;
he has this man’s, or I’m sadly mis
taken. ’
“But the four envelopes—they and
the post card are all addressed in the
same hand; the envelopes were all
postmarked at New York; but the
card bearing the latest date was
mailed in Chicago.”
"And your conclusion is,” appended
Miss Bertel, "that a rendezvous was
arranged; that the card definitely fixed
the time and place."
“Exactly. Now, then, here’s some
thing you don’t know.
“The first of this month a contract
Is going to be awarded to the success
ful bidder for the construction of the
Wrye Neck ship canal in Massachu
setts —a ten-million dollar enterprise.
Just between ourselves, the Hercules
Construction company of Chicago is
the only one among some seven or
eight bidders that is at all likely to bo
successful, because it is the only one
of the lot that is able to put up the
heavy cash bond required. The others
might in time, of course; but the Her
cules people have the cash, and that’s
what counts.’
“Last Thursday—July 2, bear In
mind—Henry Biddle of the Hercules
company received word that one John
Prince of Prince & Penthouse, a big
firm of New York engineers, would
arrive in Chicago with certain draw
ings and specifications that are of
vital importance in connection with
the projected canal work. He should
have come Friday morning, and Biddle
and one or two others of the company
were at the station to meet Prince.
Well, he didn’t show up."
"1 see,” Miss Bertel interposed.
‘Prince is missing and you hoped I
had found him for you.”
"Correct. But your protege is not
John Prince; Prince is a much older
man.
"Friday went by, and no news from
the messenger. Then Biddle became
alarmed. The Hercules people had
reason to move cautiously, you under
stand; the matter had been kept as
secret as possible; but it began to
look as though they had been circum
vented by their enemies, if these par
ticular plans and specifications fall
into the hands of a certain competing
concern it will be all up with Biddle
and his crowd.
“Well, by the time Biddle got busy
on the wire Friday, Prince & Pent
house had closed—not to open again
till today, because Saturday, the
fourth, was a holiday, and then he
called us in. We have been scouring
the city for Prince without picking up
a trace of him.
"Stealing those papers is just the
sort of stunt that Rawlings and his
gang would pull off. ’
Hazard called police headquarters
on the telephone and inquired whether
“Denver Ed” Rawlings was known to
be In the city. The reply came back that
Rawlings and two confederates well
known to the police had been in Chi
cago at least since the third (Friday),
and that they were being watctied.
“Finch the whole mob,” Hazard ear
nestly requested, "just as soon as you

can get the order out. i’ll tell you
why you want them by the time
they’re brought in.”
IV.
Hazard and Miss Bertel returned to
tlu> room where they had left the un
known. For upwards of an hour the
detective tried to assist the young
man to penetrate the veil that hung
over Ids past, but ail to no purpose.
Enlarging upon the story he had told
Miss Bertel, he repeated numerous
times all the names that must have
been familiar to anyone having con
nection with the firms under consid
eration, or any association with the
huge enterprise that was of such mo
ment to Ids supposed confreres. The
unknown sat shaking his head and re
peating: "it is all strange to me,” or
"I never heard that name before.”
Hazard gave up in despair. Where
upon .Miss Bertel, who had remained a
silent but interested spectator, was
at once inspired. She rose and laid
a sheet of paper on a desk and handed
a pencil to the young man. Outside,
there was almost a constant roar from
passing elevated trains. She pointed
to the structure and motioned to the
desk.
"Draw that,” she commanded —“the
‘L’ span rigid in front of you.”
Without demur the ycung man seat
ed himself at the desk and bent over
the paper; but at once he reached out
a hand and groped for something he
could not find.
Next instant he started to hie feet.
The pencil dropped from his fingers,
and like a man suddenly roused from
sleep he stood blinking at Hazard and
the girl.
“I—l—l can’t draw It to scale,” he
stammered, "not without my—my—”
He suddenly broke off and shouted:
"1 know now—l’m a draftsman!”
V.
Although Felix Hazard and Helen
Bertel were both jubilant over the suc
cess of her strategem, the unknown
was plunged into depths of despon
dency even more profound than be
fore.
"To think!” he groaned. “I was al
most blinded by the vividness of it
all; I had everything in my grasp;
then —puff!—and the curtain dropped
again, the rift in the veil closed.”
“Cheer up,” Hazard encouraged
him. "You are coming on famously.
Let’s all go get a bite to eat, then
we’ll drop in on my friend Cowles over
at police headquarters.” .
An hour later Lieutenant Cowles
greeted Hie trio at police headquar
ters.
“I have the whole mob,” he an
nounced, eyeing Hazard. "Keep your
promise and tell me why I’m holding
them; I don’t want to get into trouble.”
“You’ll get into the newspapers;
that’s about the worst that will hap
pen to you,” returned Hazard. "Fetch
in Rawlings.”
The immediate effect of that indi
vidual’s appearance was startling and
thrilling. Before anyone could lift a
hand to interfere the unknown leaped
at Rawlings and the two went to the
floor in a fighting, snarling heap. They
thrashed about so furiously that tt was
impossible, until some seconds had
elapsed, for any of the several po
licemen present to secure a handhold
upon either of the combatants.
When presently they were dragged
apart Rawlings was colorless and
gasping for breath, while the other
lay inert, a thin trickle of nlood from

chair and caused his grip to relax.
In less than a minute, however, the
young fellow recovered consciousness
and looked about in a dazed, bewil
dered way. Helen Bertel and Felix
Hazard, who were bending over nini,
he seemed not to recognize at all. Ig
noring them, he rose unsteadily to his
feet. His gaze straightway fell upon
"Denver Ed" Rawlings securely held
between two uniformed men.
"You dirty thug!” he gritted. Then
to the policemen; "You chaps didn’t
get here any too soon; that rascal was
abeut to drop me into the river. . . .
Why, he’s got my clothes on!” in a
sudden burst of recognition.
"Do you know him?” Hazard in
quired.
"Know him!” exclaimed the other.
“1 know him for a crook and a black
leg. Tried to make me believe he
was Henry Biddle—strung me along
till he got me into this joint—no, this
isn’t the place, either; 1 must have
been knocked silly. We were on a
river dock w here a lot of small boats
were moored. Three huskies jumped
me at once. Last thing I knew they
were tumbling me into one of the
boats ’’
"You are from Prince & Penthouse?”
Hazard pressed him.
The young man returned a ques
tioning look, but answered:
"Yes. Fri, hie is my name —Carl
Frisbie. At the last moment Mr.
Prince was taken ill, and I had to
come in his stead. Are you Mr
Biddle?’
“No, but I’m representing him. I’ll
explain everything by and by. Do you
remember this lady?"
Frisbie glanced at Helen and col
ored with embarrassment.
“I —I—l think not.” he stammered.
"I never saw her before.”
Helen and Hazard exchanged
glances amt smiled, detecting which
Frisbie pleadid:
"What the dickens does it all mean?
I’ve had the devil’s own time since
landing in Chicago.”
"All In good time, Mr. Frisbie; there
are a nuinbci of explanations to oe
made ail round.
“First, though, about the papers you
were to bring— ’’
The other interrupted:
“By George, that crook didn’t get
them! 1 was taking no chances. Be
fore leaving Now York 1 mailed them
to myself, registered, care ot the
Blackstone hotel, f suppose they ot a
notice are there now.”
Some time inter, when Felix Hazard,
Carl Frisbie cud Helen Bertel gath
ered in the lirst-named’s office, the
young engineer was incredulous when
told that he had lost a whole twenty
four hours out of his life, but after a
while he believed, and could not llud
words to express bis gratitude. As
a matter of fact, his demeanor toward
Helen w’as so ardent that Hazard ex
perienced a peculiar feeling of resent
ment against him; his interest in the
affair promptly grew lukewarm.
And when, finally, the connection be
tween "Denver Ed” and the Hercules
company's competitor was established,
and Kawlings an£ an official ot the
competing company were convicted of
criminal conspiracy, the detective re
ceived the news with au exclamation
of impatience.
Miss Bertel, who told him about it,,
gave him a sly look
“Perhaps,” she demurely added, ‘you
think they should have gotten longer
stretches; but 1 for one teel sorry for
poor Ed Kawlings. He looked so.
