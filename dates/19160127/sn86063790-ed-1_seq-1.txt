The mail order houses and the ex-1
V press company should appreciate the j
way that we are having prohibition :
down this way; as it is a big item for
them?three, ten to fifteen gallons!
handled per day at this station. So j
we see now that prohibition does not |
prohibit. The one-gallon-a-month j
law should be killed, or go back to!
the dispensary where our schools and
* towns could derive some good from
the profits. Why not have the dis-j
pensary and only sell one gallon to j
each customer per month? Or cut
out the exception (one gallon a j
month) and have prohibition in full
! force.
L Xo fertilizer has been shipped to I

as to get in some good fresh ground. J
Y They seem to be early with their

Day.?Camel Datable I'setl. | ^
Columbia. Jan. 24.?.Mr. Smith's j
hi 11 to increase the salaries of State
i S
officers was killed in the house last
J
night by the decisive majority of k.*> I
to 24. The bill bad received a major-j
ity unfavorable report from the ways!
and means committee, although its j
i
provisions were not to become effect-; ^
ive until after the expiration of the 0
; a
terms of the incumbents. \
The psychology of the situation, asi ,
j c
seen by a member of the ways and ;
means committee, was presented thus!
1 i i
by .Mr. Sellers: "Do you not realize
that once the camel has his head un- i .
der the edge of the tent he will not he! "
satisfied until he gets his entire body
g
inside the tent?"
The bill provided that the salary
of the governor be increased to $4,000,
those of other State officers to i 0
? - . ^ . > _ f A _ i? . 1 . _ IP
$Z,4UU. inose 01 justices 01 me su-: preme
court to $3,">00 and those of| n
circuit judges to $3,500. The salary j ^
of the superintendent of the State j ^
Hospital for the Insane was to be de-j
creased to $2,500 and the salaries -I
of superintendents of other institu-jt
tions were to he made $2,400. j it
Proponents of the measure held j ti
out in vain .that it is a big blight on j c
the name of the State to pay its offi- e
cials a salarv of onlv $1,900.
i
.Mr. .Moore moved to strike out the| w
enacting w^rds. j s
Author Defends Measure. j p
.Mr. Smith, author of the bill, said i j
i
that the salaries of the State officers) ij
were fixed several years ago, since J f<
which time new offices, such as those |
of insurance commissioner, ware- \ ^
house commissioner and secretary of j n
| -1
the State board of charities and cor- j
rections, have been created with sala-1
I *
ries of $2,500 as compared with the j n
$1,900 now paid State officers. ^e|tl
pointed out that a man of ordinary j .
means cannot be governor at the I
present salary of only $3,500. Heltj
said that a number of professors in j
the State colleges get more than the j
secretary of State. I *
' h
"Do you realize that clerks often ^
get $1,800 in a department where
the head of it receives only $1,000?"
asked Mr. Smith. "We must not al-j?
' ii
low the judiciary, the State offices
and other offices to deteriorate. It
is an indictment against the State to 11
have such low salaries for our offices."
He pointed out that the work s
and travel of the judges necessitated i a
an increase. ^
Mr. McMahan said that the present s'
salaries of $1,900 were fixed in the s<
early '90s, since when the expenses *J
of living have materially increased.
He insisted?that it is vital to the It
principle of true Democracy to give S
adequate salaries. Mr. McMahan e
wanted the salary of the governor c;
made $6,000 and the salaries of cir- j h
cuit judges $5,000. S
Mr. Moore, opposing the bill, said a
that there are men in the State ready n
and willing to step in and take the n
position of any State officer at the
present salary. He urged the legislature
to proceed with care: especially (
as the return of good times is not yet
assured in his opinion. "Let us not
increase our appropriations," lie said. J
"but pursue a policy of retrenchment |
and reform."
Mr. Smith and Mr. Moore sot into ^
a colloquy over supposed remarks re- ,
srarding the abilitv of members of the
. a
ways and means committee. ^
Mr. Sellers said that the unfavorable
report had been submitted as a
1 o
result of the resolution adopted by i
the ways and means committee to ,
stay the appropriation bill within
$2,000,000. with the exception of I
/ , ! u
such monev as is realized irom otnerf
i o
sources than the State tax .ew.
. t
Mr. Searson favored the bill and ,
said that it is not fair to tak~ advan:age
of a man's partriotism. j
The bill was kiiled on a ' -a an ; < .

nay vote of *5" to 24.

hi a rural court the old squire had ." *
made a ruling .so unfair that three ''
young lawyers at once protested
against such a miscarriage of jus- J e
tice. The squire immediately fined "
each of the lawyers five dollars for j y
contempt of court. ! 1
j
There was silence, and then an j
older lawyer walked slowly to the |
front of the room and deposited a <
$10 bill with the clerk. He then ad-!
p
dressed the judge as follows: I ,
J 11
"Vnnv lionnr. I wish, to sta*e that

I have twice as much contempt for ?
this court as any man in the room."

operating with the States in the construction
of roads.
He answered criticism of Representative
Walsh, of Massachusetts I
that the bill discriminated against
the Xew England States, in that they,
already had built good roads, and j
that under the provisions of the bill,
they would receive but a small por-j
tion in proportion to the amount that j
they had contributed to the federal;
funds, by the statement that Boston
and New York and the other great
cities of the East were dependent
upon the South and West, in great
measure, for their prosperity, audi
that by reason of the increased use'
of automobiles the road problem was j
no longer a local one. the use of roads i
not being confined to adjoining land;
owners, but extending to owners of;
automobiles who lived in other conn-!
ties and States, and contributed noth-j
ing to the roads over which they
traveled in their machines.
He explained in detail the provisions
of the bill, stating that it re-;
quired that every State by 11?20 j
should have a highway commission j
if it expects to participate in it. and]
that South Carolina today had no]
such commission.
He said he favored the hill because j
it was impossible for the United I
States government to cooperate with j
any unit smaller than the State; that
it was required before aid could be
given to a road that plans and specifications
of the road should be presented
to the secretary of agriculture,
and that, it was impossible for
the counties of the various States to
have in their employ engineers who
could prepare these plans and the
only way in which it could be made
practicable would be for the States
to have engineers in their employ
who could do this work for the counties.
He argued that if the United States
government was forced to keep accounts
with the 4.000 or more counties
or 30,000 townships of the United
States, most of the fund would be
consumed in salaries to bookkeepers
and never would reach the roads:
that under the provisions of the bill
a State like South Carolina would receive
$4 50,000 and it would be left]
to the State instead of to the seore-j
A ? 11 " ? ^ on ! ifli t]l fl
iarv ui ugi iluiuu e uu v?ucic: i
roads should be built, and this pro-'
vision also made it possible tor the J
work to be done under the laws of
the State instead of the laws of the
United States, and did not give to the
United States government any jurisdiction
over the road after it was
built.
He declared that if the highway
commission of a State was arbitrary
in its action, the people of the State j
could remedy it at the next election,
but if it were left to the secretary of
agriculture, and he should, through
lack of knowledge of local conditions,
or for other reasons be arbitrary in
the selection of the roads to be improved,
the people of the State would
have no remedy, and therefore, the
requirements that a State in order to
participate should have a highway
commission would be beneficial in
- i * a - - i l ~
stead ot injurious to me Mate, nej
111 the I'nion having no such com- j
i
said that there were only five States!
missions, and without such provision I
it was impossible for the bill to pass.
He called attention to the fact|
that the Democratic platform declared
in favor of federal aid to the
State:- in the construction of roads,
and caiied upon the party to redeem j
its pledge.

Leads to Debate.?Equal
Suffrage Defeated.
Columbia. Jan. 23.?The second
week of the 1 D1 *? session of the general
assembly was a busy one in legislative
circles. .Many important
measures were disposed of: the majority
of the bills introduced at this
session have been reported out of
committee; most important of all.
the law makers have shown a disposition
to reduce the calendar, which
011 account of the large number of
bills introduced is a 38-page document
in the house and an 1 S-page
one in the senate.
Each week sees the prohibition
law strengthened, directly or indirectly.
Early in the week the house
passed the Liles bill, providing for
a term sentence 'without the option
of a fine to be imposed on any person
violating any law of the State
regarding the sale or shipment of ini
? a.: t: T1. . 1..
loxicaung liquors. 1 ue lesiMiiuur
had already passed a measure to
make drunkenness on the public
highway a misden eanor. It is probable
also that the house will this
week disposed of the bill by .Messrs.
Orum, Sellers and Wagnon. to make
an appropriation of $50,Don for
the enforcement of the prohibition
and gallon-a-month laws: the
bill received a favorable report from
the committee.
Scholarships Live Topic.
The abuse of free tuition and
scholarships in the State colleges has
led to suggestions of remedial legislation
in the senate. A bill by Senator
Yerner is now pending 011 second
reading to abolish free tuition and
scholarships and providing that students
shall pay at least $4 0 tuition
each year: an amendment is urged
by Senator Carlisle to allow the students
to sign notes payable two years
after leaving school. The question
will be disposed of this week.
A plan suggested by Senator
Laney, of Chesterfield, is to have the
State board of education to act as a
clearing house for scholarships and
free tuition, which board would investigate
the particular merits of
each application. An amendment
which has been highly commended
by some of the senators has been offered
by Senator Padgett, of Colleton
county, who would have the
fiscal agent of the State hoard of
charities and corrections investigate
the financial status of the parents
or guardians of students seeking
State aid and report to the general
assembly. Abuse of the privilege
would automatically forfeit State aid.
Woman suffrage, for the first time
seriously considered and fought for
011 the floor of the house, met defeat
Thursday night by a vote of 01 to
51. The unexpected strength of the
equal suffrage cause was gratifying
to the suffragists of the State.
The courtesv of the floor was exI
tended during the week to three
speakers from other States. Tuesday
night the joint assembly was ad!

views on the question of national
preparedness.
One of the important features of
the coining' week is the elections hy
the joint assembly to fill vacancies in
the following offices: Comptroller
general, insurance commissioner, one
associate justice, two circuit judges,
warehouse commissioner, code commissioner.
State librarian, two trustees
of Winthrop college, two directors
of the State penitentiary, two
trustees of the University of South j
Carolina, three trustees of Clenison
college, two trustees of the State colfnr
notrrnes. two members of tile
hoard of visitors of the Citadel. Interest
centres principally in the races
for warehouse commissioner and
code commissioner, and it is understood
that Associate .Justice Fraser
will be opposed for reelection by;
I
George S. Mower, representative from J
Xewberrv county.
The policy of "let well enough [

when it defeated a bill by Mr. Harper

ness) from one who has been interested
enough to go over to see for
himself."
There was a fight tonight 011 the
2-cent passenger rate bill. Mr. Odom
wanted the bill recommitted. .Mr.
Boyd, of Spartanburg, insisted that
the 2-cent rate bill was wrong at
this time.
Mr. Alan Johnstone, Jr., made a
sensible talk and urged that the
house lacked figures and exact data
on which to base such a reduction.
He held that it was wrong to force
such an arbitrary reduction without
regard to the actual facts.
Mr. Moore, of Abbeville, said he
; wanted the 2-cent rate for the masses
j and not for the two travelling asso!
ciations. He did not blame the T. P.
A. and V. C. T. for getting a good
bargain, but it was a selfish agreement
on their part, he said, and he
spoke for the masses.
The house refused to recommit the
bill and by a vote of 4S to 40 passed
the measure and sent it to the senate.

.Mobile, Ala., .Jan. 21.?G. \V. Atwell,
alias "Tidwell." said to be
from Greenville, S. C., was arrested
in Gulfport, Mississippi, today at the
request of federal authorities at Pensacola,
Fla., who charged him with
transporting his wife. Mrs. Isabel Atwell,
from Florala, Aia., to Pensacola.
for immoral purposes. Atwell
or Tidwell is said to be wanted in
South Carolina under sentence to
serve seven years far manslaughter,
and also for jumping a $5,000 bond.
The wife of the man, in company with
J. W. Ferrell, alias "G. \V. Woods,V
was arrested here last Saturday for
the Pensar-ola authorities on the
charge of white slavery. Both were
sent back to that place, where they
are in jail, under heavy bond. The

attempted to commit suicide in jail
here, hut doctors removed the poison

to place the compulsory school attendance

Looking at the matter as a busij
ness proposition, the senate by a de|
cided majority favored the reorgani!
zation of the engrossing department,
i Figures were produced to show that
i this department uses an appropria!
tion of about on each year,
. whereas, if typewriters and eompe,
tent stenographers were used the
; cost would aggregate little more
! more than >5! .000. This action bv
!
| the senate is in accordance with the
. policy of retrenchment determined
j upon by rim legislature, and it is
| said tkat the bill by Senator Verner
! will meet with comparatively little
opposition in the house.
In the house the --cent mileage
bill, the rate to apply on railroads
i more than "?0 miles in length on intrastate
business, passed with comparative
ease. it was maintained
that the increased travel due to the
; deceased rate would more than comI
; pensate the railroads for the reduc;

where a hill by Senator Sherard
is now on the calendar to authorize
upon the approval of the voters in a
general election the issuance of not
more than $10,ooo.ooo in bonds, the
proceeds to be loaned to tillers of
the soil on long term credits at a
low rate of interest.
It is presumed now that the tight
against the South Carolina tax commission,
created last year, will centre
principally upon amendments to
the act rather than the abolition of
the board. It. is thought also that
the bill to abolish the State board
of charities and corrections, which
, was reported unfavorably in both
houses, will not receive much support.
