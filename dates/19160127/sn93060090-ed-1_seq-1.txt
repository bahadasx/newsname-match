Sad Accident.
On last Sun. two young men
were drowned by going out on
what is known as the Million
pond Scot Habbot we understand
.22 years old and a young man by
the name of Trotter we under
stand 18 years oid no one knows
the particulars for we under
stand the rirst that was saw was
their caps on the ice and two
boles broken thru the ice, which
caused a search to be made and
the yourlg men found under the
ice drowned, sad to think of.
FIRE.
The dwelling house of
Mr.,
Cuttings riglitnar Pleasant Hill
burned down with all its con
tents on last Mon. evening while
Mr. Cuttings was at his neigh
bors Mr., Smarts. A small insur.
ence was oh the bouse we did
not learu the particulars fur
ther than we have stated.
IS IT RIGHT TO USE THE
ODD FELLOW'S LODGE
ROOM FOR ANY KIND
OP WORLDLY A-MUSEMENT?
We answer it is not
right.
And our first reason is
this.
That the Ode" Bellows Hall can
not be legally opened without
the word 'of God i9 laying on the
altar in the center of the room,
This is not all. whenever one is
so lucky to get to be a member
of this Fraternal Order, when
ever '.hey entor the sacred Hal!
about the lirst thing they hear
is, ''Here the world is shut out.'"
And whenever the Bible is the
uppermost of all things in any
room, it alone shuts the world
out. Therefore there is no room
for worldly amusements in our
lodge rooms You learn that on
those two grand and noble prin
ciples, vtith many many more
that we could give we reDeatj
that there can be no right given
legally to have worldly amuse
ments in an Odd Fellow Lodge
room.
Herein is found the most sac
red ties and obligations from a
Bibical standpoint ever taken by
mortal man. For to have any
thing of a worldly nature in a
Lodge room reminds us of when
Christ was here on earth.' when
Hk went ioto the tereple and
found it fuil of money changers,
and His took cords and whipped
them out, and said "it is written
ray bouse is a house of prayer,
but you have made it a den of
thieves and robbers.'' These
are our main reasons for our
( poaition.
I
Is It Gambling, toputupa
cake and then run two women,
for tl e cake inorder to see which
one of the two is the prettiest?
We shall answer, that if horse
racing is gambling. Then the
above circumstance, would be
gambling. And still more so.
than horse racing
Neither one' could be compar
ed to a public sale. For at a
public sale the article is put up
and sold to the highest bidder.
And whoever becomes the
highest bidder, pays fur the
goods. The man who bids
against bim pays nothing. Not
so in horse racing. "And it is
not the case, in the point refer
red to in our neading. And in
the case of the cake- and the two
women. We consider it not
jgambling alone but shameful
fclso.
The cake has no part in
it, no farther than to make a
piece fur the victorious party
after the game lor race) is won.
It 'is not the cake that is held
in question':4 wbd there are two
women utup. It is the two
woman, or their beauty held in
question. And the gambling is
done either on the two women
or their beauty. And the prize
is to the one that has the best
friends and the most money. In
other words the money goes to
the stake holder, paid in by - the
looser and winner both. And
even the winner, does not get
the woman, bought unless it was!
a father or a husband, and
should this be the cuse how
would the'father or the husband
feel tc see their daughter or
wife gaaibkjd o'. It would be
a sbane would it not? Yes we
say a shame .
PROTECTION.
We want to be fully under
stood ou what we have said here
to-fore on Preparedness. As
we said then, so say we now,
that we do not believe in Propar-'
jedness, for peace, or for a time
or peace, uut we cio believe in
a man protecting his own house
hold. And we surely believe that
this government should protect
its own citizens, and that to the
letter. We believs that any
cation or government should
use all the power at its
command to protect itself and
people But not to go to a Pre
paredness, for peace, to cause a
debt of millions of dollars to
hang over us in time of peace.
Instead of this.- let the govern
mental officers with the whole
people go into the Preparedness
that Christ has bid us do. For
the great peace that remain for
the peopie of God.
We have made this statement
for fear some Reader wou'd think
that we did not want our citizens
protected. If it takes our brav
est men to do it let it be so.
But this does not change our
views on Preparedness spoken,,
of today for peace.

HOME LIFE
We wish we could suf. ciuatl;;
impress upon-- every woman the
importance of the home, and that
a woman can have no higher
work in life than making a home
for her husband a:;d growing
children. This truth is in great
j danger of bein;j lost sight of in
I those modern times, when wom
en will leave their little children
to be cared for by hirelings
while tbey take up outside,
work.-, which might just as well
be dtrtte-by others. Of course il
tlhe mother is obliged to earn
their living, that is a good e.v
cuse, but if not, she has none.
If all good people who depro
cate divorces would be more
careful aoout making marriages
if the churches would not give
their sanction to bargains for
titles, and then deplore the out
come, there Jwould not be so
manv mistakes to rectify. The
first thing for any human being
to learn is that life ic "ia-v and
any transgression, will isring
! trouble. , "
