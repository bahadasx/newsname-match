bootblack, was found dead in his room
at 11 Washin ton street last night.
In his*clothes were bank books show
ing he had saved over $3,500. His
death was due to insufficient nourish
ment, show tap that he had starved
himself rather than draw on his sav

downtown district, where he was
kaown as "John, the Bootblack." He
carded his shoe box around with him
and worked mostly in ferry houses
and sidewalks in Battery Park.

1E1 RELEASED
PLEADED GUILTY TO VIOLATION
OF PROHIBITION LAW—PAR
DONED BY WILSON.
ii
Minot, N. D., Jan: 25.—President
Wilson yesterday pardoned 17 resi
dents of the Fort Berthold reserva
tion who were found guilty at the last
term of the Federal Court in this city
of violation of the Indian treaty in re
fenence to takink intoxicating liquors

When the accused nun entered pleas
of guilty, it was with the understand
ing that clemency would be asked.
Judge Amidon suspended sentence on
the accused for sixty days in order
that the president might pardon the
men.
It was acknowledged at tie time of
convictions of the men th:.t they we:
ignorant of the conditions of the trea
ty provisions under which they were
pro* bited from taking intoxicating
liquor onto the reservation even for
their own use.
JEW SUFFERERS
The day set -p-rt by President Wil
son for the giving aid to help the
Jewish war sufferers is today, and
there are committees working in the
city gathering funds for the purpose
of helping those war stricken people.
The ladies committee, who can be
found at the Commercial club rooms
are Mrs. M. L. Sprung, Mrs. 0. T.
Geno and Mrs. E. M. Crary. The
cause is a good one and all should do
their mite in helping these sufferers.
OF THE SEASON
Tuesday evening it began snowing,
and up to this time, Thursday noon, it
still continues to snow, and there has
been a fall of nearly a foot. There
has been considerable wind with it and
there are many banks and drifts. All
trains ere delayed, and some are not
running at all. The train on the Far
mers' line has not moved since Tues
day night and will not attempt to
make a trip until the storm is over.
NELS RESVICK
SENDS
Last Friday we got a letter from
the same enclosing a $6 sheck for
three years subscription to the World.
Mr. Resvick wrote as follows:
"I am sending you check for $6 to
pay our subscription to the World, and
thank you very much for sending the
paper for so long without any pay
ment in advance. It is a welcome
visitor at our home every week, and
we like it very well. Am doing well
in my Canadian home. Will close
wishing you every success."
Letters like this pleases us, as they
only go to show that the World is ap-i
predated by its readers.
The Annual Mid-Winter Fair of the
LiJke Region of North Dakota opened
its doors in this city Tuesday morn
ing, and is still in session. During
the whole week the weather has been
very cold and stormy, in fact a real
blizzard has been raging, and this has
been the means of keeping hundreds
of people away. However, the crowd
has been much larger than was or
could be expected, and those in at
tendance have been having a good and
profitable time.
Each day there has been good enter
tainment, and the buildings where the
exhibits are have been thronged from
morning until night. The exhibits are
very good, and in many departments
surpass all former exhibits. Espec
ially in the school departments there
is a large exhibit, and in the line of
grains and corn the exhibits are very
good.
Had the weather been fine the crowd
would have been record-breaker, and
in a measure there was keen disap
pointment that we could not have had
a pleasant week.
Practically all the judging has been
done and the following is the list of
prizes awarded. This list is as com
plete as we could get at the time of
going to press, and while there may
be some exceptions it is practically
complete:

For some time Ho. P. J. McClory,
one of our well known citizens, has
been interesting capital to start the
manufacture of what is known as
Lemon Washing Powder, and judging
from the following which is taken
from the St. Paul Dispatch, he has
been successful in getting this corpor
ation into working order, and in a very
short time the concern will be manu
facturing this high class washing
powder. From what we can learn it
is a great preparation, and the out
look is that it will lead all other wash
ing powders on the market. The many
friends of Mr. McClory will be pleased
to know that he has progressed so
nicely in his work of organizing a
company to manufacture and place
this product on the market.
Here is the article from the Dis
patch:
The 2-story building on University
avenue, near Lexington, formerly oc
cupied by the Manteuffel Refrigerator
company, has been bought by the Lem.
on Washing Powder Co., a $100,000
concern whose headquarters up to this
time have been in Minneapolis. The
company will begin the manufacture
of washing powder on a large scale
February 1st.
North Dakota interests control the
company, which was induced to locate
in St. Paul thru the efforts of the in
dustrial committee of the Association
of Commerce.
Last Ffi at the Geo. Nixon farm
in Hope towr^ftip, a young man by the
name of John Krous w&s killed by fall
ing 9n a gasoline engine/ his head hit
ting the drfv# wheel, crushing Jus
skull. There was not one present a£
the time of the accident and just how
it happened will never be known. He
was found unconscious and medical aid
was summoned and everything pos
sible was done for him but he passed
away Friday night. He was about 20
years old nd was working at the Nix.
on farm. His people lived in Lincoln,

The dance given by the local lodge
of Elks in the roller rink Friday night
was one of the pleasant social affairs
of the season. It was the intention to
give this dance in the Odd Fellows'
hall, but so r.jany had signified their
intention of attending that it was de
cided to change the place to the rink,
in order to have more room, and the
change was very timely, and the large
crowd present would not have enjoyed
themselves in a smaller hall. At 12
o'clock a lap supper was served, after
which the dancing was kept up until
the we sma' hours of the morning.
Owing to the bad weather most of
the week the management of the Mid
Winter fair has dedded to continue
it for one day longer and therefore it
will continue tomorrow, Friday, all
day. This will be one of the best days
of the fair and all are cordially invited
to attend.
Attorney F. R. Stevens left this
week for Ann Arbor, Mich., where he
will join Mrs. Stevens, who has been
visiting there for some time. They
will spend the balance of the
there, returning to their Crary
in the spring.
