from the start, wjilca, In my opinion,
should be the object of all our laws
providing for the settlement and de
velopment of the publlo domain. If
we have the right kind of a settler
and provide him with land that will
furnish him a living, and a future
chance to accumulate some money,

the reoulremeaU of the law as to

Henry Ford's penco mission failed for
lack of "faith." According to his own
htr.toniont, faith wab Ford's solo slock
when ho started. He had not enough,
and those who accompanied hliu, uith
a few exceptions, appear to havo had
but little.
Those of tho party who really wish
ed the expedition well were so bitterly i
hated that an effort was made to ma
roon a number of them at the nrst
European port touched. Ford's plan,
aa nearly as It Is possible to put so
Intangible a thing on paper, was to
give the warring nations mental sci
ence treatment. Ford himself, at the
outsat, had unbounded faith la hla
ability. Despite the statement attrib
uted to htm that ha Inteaded to "gat
the boya out of tbe trenobes by Christ-
" he did not count on Immedi
ately enilag the war.
What Ford did believe was that he

was horrible; not so much because of
tho Incessant quarreling, as on ac

A patent has been Issued to K. P.

Buck Island Is a mile or so from
the boat landing on Upper .Klamath
Lake, and It contains about 166 acres
of-land. The soil Is adapted to gar

The Issuance of a patent was f urta- ft
