ADVANTAGE OF BETTER ROADS.
Statu Engineer W. Bliss Gives Some
Vaiuealile Information Regarding
The Saving Made By
Good Roads'
The. Commissioner of Agriculture
and Labor, Mr. R. F. Flint, has esti
mated that the 1915 crop of wheat,
oats, barley, rye, flax, spelts, potatoes
HHs&oorn
:fr££»r«?ai
bushels
in addition to which he estimates that
2,167,002 tons of hay were harveted.
From these estimates J. W. Bliss,
State Engineer, has complied the fol
lowing information concerning the
cost of marketing this crop, which is
of interest:
The total number of bushels of corp
as given above amounts to 3,545,997
tons, to which we must add the hay,
making a total of 10,742,999 ton of
farm products. The best information
available shows that of this total ton
nage approximately ti,000,000 tons has
been or eventually will be hauled to
market over the various public roads
to the state. The S. Department of
Agricultural estimates that in North
Dakota the average load is 66 bushels
of wheat or its equivalent, amounting
to a trifle more than 1.8 tons. It would
take 3,333,333 trips with one a wagon
or a wagon train 1G.000 miles in length,
or 40 wagon trains stretching across
the state from east to west, tn market
the 1615 crop.
The U. S. Department of Agricul
ture, in Farmers' Bulletin 672, states
that the average distance to market
for North Dakota i» seven miles. Ac
cepting this as being correct, the work
required to market the 1915 crop will
be.42,000,000 ton miles, and assuming
that 15 cents is the average cost of
moving one ton one mile, the total
cost of moving the 191-5 crop from the
farm to market will be 66,300,000, or
just a few cents less than 810.00 for
every man, woman and -!iil-i in the
state. Iu other words, the total cost
of marketing is 2 per csr.t of the total
estimated value ot the entire produc
tion for 1815, or 3 S per cent of the
value of that portion of the crop which
is sold, the estimated value of the to
tal crop being $226. 218,053, which the
value of that portion marketed is esti
mated at $160,846.
Looked at from the viewpoint of dol
lars and cents, and considering only
the transportation of crops to market,
the importance of construction better
roads and more efficiently maintain
ing those already built becomes
strikingly apparent, since better roads
means, within reasonable limits, big
ger loads.

Rulings of the Rail Road fioiiiiiiissionen.
Parties holding mortgages on grain
warehouses and grain therein have
some times* attempted, through assign
ment by mortgagor, to collect the. in
surance on stored grain. Th"6 railroad
commission holds that insurance on
stored grain in the warehouse, or in
transit, is a trust fund for the benefit
of the owner of the grain.
In a number of cases where grain
dealers have ceased business through
sale of the elevator, retirement, or In
case of fire or insolvancy, they have
experienced difficulty in calling in out:
standing storage tickets, partioulary
on a rising market, the ticket holders
desiring to holding for higher prices.
The railroad commislon has ruled that
a dealer under such circumstances may
deposit in the name of the ticket hold:
er some local bank of good repute' the
value of the outstanding grain on bis
storage ticket on the day he quit busi
ness and the hoider of the ticket is
competed after due notice to accept
this price and surrender his ticket, as'
•the commision holds he oannot specul
ate on the warehouseman's account af
ter the warehouseman has gone out of
business. In several instances elevator
companies have failed or an elevator
has burned and its owner has not re
sumed business. A question hasaris
en in such cases as to the date out
standing storage tickets became pay
able, as that date governs the price to
be paid. The railroad commission
hokl3 that the date the warehouse was
closed or burned shall be the date for
redemption of tickets.
Would'nt there be a terrible turmoil
in this old world if we executed half
the dire thing .we work out in our
minds.
It's a mighty good-for-nothing wo
man who can't support oneman and an
entirely good-for-nothing woman who
tries it.
While some of us are casting around'
for opportunity others would consider
it the greatest opportunity of a life"
time to be in a position we are so anx
ious to cast aside.
The person doesn't want the things'
he can't get is quite likely to be fairly
contented, but if we all stopped with
the things that are easily attained what
a slow old world this would be.
