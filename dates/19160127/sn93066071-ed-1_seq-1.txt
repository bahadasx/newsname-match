be entirely successful and that the
patient may speedily recover
During the past two weeks a number
of our subscribers have responded to
our request for payment of their sub
scription accounts and have come In
and settled up in full and for a year or
two in advance. We certainly appre
ciate this action on their part. While
many have paid, there yet remains a
large list of those who aru slightly in
arrears and we would bo grateful to all
such If they could arrange to take care
of their; email accounts within the next
few weeks. As we said before, it is
only a matter of a few dollars to each
of our subscribers, but to us, having
hundreds of such small accounts out
standing, it means several hundred
dollars, which would come in mighty
handy now In helping to pay for the
new machinery and equipment, which
we have found it necessary to install
In order to keep the Herald alone at
the front of the procession. If conven
ient to do 80, we would appreclato a
few dollars on subscription from those
in arrears, add we won't bar those
who are already paid up in advance, if
they want to extend their subscrip
tions a few more notches.

Amid screeching of whistles and the
lusty yells of the large crjwil which
had congregated to greet it, The First
Train pulled in over the Heaver Short

Hand wa on hand to furnish music for
the decision and for a time wild
enthusiam reigned. Among the crowd
wete those.who had waited thirty years
lor this event and if they grr;w a little
hilarious in their demnifstratlotis7 they
are to be excused for it means some
thing to at last have tho fruits ot long
period ol labors, realized. We doubt
if ever another railroad was built
under tho same circumstances and by
the same means which the Beaver
Short Line was built. It is not neces
sary for us to repeat tho story of its
building for it has been told and re
told nnd the eyes of the outside world
have been attracted this way because
of the stick-to-it-ive-ness and earnest
ness with which our people worked to
complete the project. They truly
worked like "beavers" and hold on
with the tenacity of a hull dog in the
face of discouragements and opposi
tions which were enough to take the
vim out of even tho moit enthusiastic.
If ever a people had cause to rejoice, it
Is our people for they havo not only
secured the railroad, which has been
the Idol of their hopes and dreams, for
years, hut they have demonstrated
tlmt tliia. pection contains real bons.tr
ers'and thbse'whh do things and' when
they go lifter anything they always get
i the goods.
The demonstration Saturday after
noon was a sort of impromptu nffair for
it was not known for certain that the
track would be ready for the train to
pull in, (V real celebration will be
held when the road is all complete and
ready to turn over to the railroad
company.

Smith Ilebberd, formerly a resident
of the Sunset vicinity but now of
Blaine, Colorado, was hero Tuesday
on his way home from Sunset, where
he had been looking after business
interests for a time. Whilo in Bea
ver he called and had his name placed
on our Big Book and will receive the
J Herald regularly in future.
Work continues on the basement of
the Long & Lawson building this week.
The excavating is all done now and
tho cement walls are being run this
week, A largo septic tank is also
being constructed under the floor of
the basement whleh will take care of
the sewage from the three buildings
which will be .constructed en that
corner.
FORGAN DEPOT LOOTED.
The depot at Forgan was looted
Thursday night of last, week and about
twenty gallons of boozo carried off by
1 the pilferers'. It is also stated that an
attempt was made to enter the estab
lishment of the Elk Olty Sales & Com
mission Company the same night, but
tho would-be robbers wore frightened
off before they accomplished their pur
pose, With twenty gallons of booze in
their possession, it ought not to have
been hard to apprehend the miscre
ants, for we have it on good authority
that there are a number of individuals,
both In Beaver and Forgan, who can
accurately scent a much smaller nuan-
tity of "licker" a great distance.
