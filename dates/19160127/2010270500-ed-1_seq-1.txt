Georgia Statesman Says Noncombat-
ants In Teutonic Nations Should

ted States whllo attempting to destroy

tho rights of citizens of tho United
States and other neutral nations woro
being recklessly disregarded and em
phasized particularly what ho de
nounced as Great Britain's lawless
treatment of American cotton trado.
Discussing tho action of tho allies
In proclaiming cotton as a contraband,
the senator assorted that cotton had
not been used or needed' by Gormany
or her allies In tho manutacturo of war
munitions for moro than eight months.
"Shall wo quietly contlnuo to fur
nish Great Britain what sho Is com
pelled to obtain from tho United States
whllo tho commercial rights of citi
zens of this country aro trampled un
dorfoot?" asked tho senator. "Groat
Britain cannot contlnuo tho war with
out munitions from tho United States.
"Tho administration has forcefully
brought to tho attention of Great Brit
ain tho rights of citizens of this coun
try. It has boon demonstrated that
citizens of neutral countries havo tho
right to ship foodstuffs and cotton in
unlimited quantities through tho neu
tral ports of northern Europo to tho
noncombatant Inhabitants of Germany
and Austria.
"Tho congress of tho United Statos
slept over tho rights of shippers of
foodstuffs last winter. This was, per
haps, becauso tho prices woro good,
porhaps becauso wo did not investi
gate tho subject. Tho lawlessness of
Great Britain has increased greatly.
"By firmness, but peacefully, neu
trals can easily obtain their rights
from both belligerents."
