"George" Is Trying
To Come Back
When the voters of Kansas at
)(the last general election retired
"Geo. A. Neeley, of Hutchinson,
from public life it was sincerely
hoped by those who knew him
best in this congressional dis
trict, as well as many others in
the state, that he would exercise
at least good judgment enough
to keep in the seclusion of pri
vate pursuits; but apparently he
cherishes a desire to mingle
again with the representatives
of the people, and has picked the
coming national convention as
presenting the best opportunity
for gaining recognition and hon
ors at the' hands of the Demo
cratic party in Kansas. No de
mand has arisen for the services
of this man at thatgreat meeting;
no call from the great body of
N Democratic voters; but he wants
to be honored and does not hesi
tate to come unbidden and ask
payors. The Hutchinson Gazette
of January 7th, carried this par
agraph on its last page:
"Former Congressman Geo.
A Neeley announced yester
day he is a candidate for del-egate-at-large
to the Demo
cratic national comention to
be held in St. Louis next June
Mr. Neeley is a warm sup
porter of President Wilson
and feels be is qualified to be
one of the Kansas represen
tatives at the convention."
The foregoing is not difficult
of comprehension: Mr. Neeley
simply wants the honor, and
reasons that it should be his be
cause he has found that it is the
popular thing to be in accord
with President Wilson.
If he were now a stranger to
the Kansas voter as be was only
a few years ago, his tactics might
bring him better results than
)tbey probably will do under ex
isting conditions, for he has with
many of us already passed the
experimental stage. For a while
he was known as the big con
gressman, as me name niieu nis
physical dimensions and afford
ed an ever retdy blanket descrip
v tion of a mac of whom so little
was known. The story of his
career as a promised statesman
can be briefly told: The demo
crats of the seventh district, with
the aid of many others elected
him to congress at a special elec
tion, giving him a short term in
which little was expected, and
of course he was returned by his
party for a full term, which prov
ed his last. No man of his time
tver had a better opportunity to
make good and rise among states
men of the day. He had not only
opportunity but also the endow
ment of ability bad it been direct
s td in proper channels. It was
expected of him that he should
make good, and the help and the
influence of the highest states
man of bis party were placed at
bis command.
There could be no eicuse for
his failure, but by what other
term could we describe bis pub
Sold and Exchanged.
lic career. He early was sought
fcy the renegades of the party
who found in him the man for
whom they had been looking, a
master in the artof duplicity and
a lover of political intrigues.
Old and true friends were
made early victims and new
friends sprang from the scum
of humanity to take their places.
It was an enchanting game and
from some evidences we might
conclude it also was profitable.
It lay in his power to pit friend
against friend, faction against
faction, and emerge a winner at
the expense of all the other fel
lows. It worked tine in big af
fairs as well as small; and after
hehad forsaken his congression
al district and the advice of true
friends, it won him the senatori
al nomination. Then the ballots
of the people retired Mr. Neeley.
Now do the Democrats of Kan
sas want to send this character
of man as one of their delegates
to the great national convention,
or is there not another Democrat
in Kansas who is a supporter of
President Wilson and who has
bad less to do , with political , in
trigues than Mr. Neeley, and
would it not also be better for
the Democratic party if a sincere
and honest statesman could be
I found for this honor, rather than
: an imitation, a disappointment,
i or a counterfeit. It has been
quite truly said by one of our
brother publishers, that probab
ly no public official of any rank
in this state ever brought to bis
friends, more heartaches, agony
of soul and disappointment than
has this man Neeley. We be
lieve this is not overdrawn, for
we know of no one who has vic
timized so many who were bis
friends. His new found friends
and co-workers may give him
strong support, but if the people
of Kansas will study his case as
it shouid be studied there need
be no question of their verdict
and no danger that the party may
be imposed upon and have his
dead weight to carry. Yester
day we heard a representative
democrat express himself thus:
'No man with a future to con
sider, a family to raise, or a soul
to save can afford to help this
man Neeley into place. M Of
course he may not be as well
known over the state as 'he is in
lie seventh district, and especi
a ly in Stafford county, and may
figure that through his public
proposition to accept the honor
of being a delegate at large from
Kansas to the national conven
tion, enough demand may be
created among the unadvised tj
name him for the place. This
would be a serious thing lor
Kansas democracy and should
not be allowed to happen. No
party can for long succeed if bur
dened with political crooks, and
if they cannot be eliminated they
should at least be kept to the
rear. The County Capital, St.
John Kansas, January 13th.

Grace Baird Stock Co
Not within the memory of the
Meade theatre goers has a su
perior of the Grace Baird Stock
Company been in our city. A
company with no "sticks" is a
treat to any community and this
certainly is one. It is unusually
well balanced and each member
does his or her part with ease
and grace. The specialties be
tween acts are snappy, up-to-the
minute and above the average.
The members of the company
are pleasing to meet and have
made many friends among our
people. Their engagement was
opened here Monday night with,
"Made in America", Tuesday
evening they presented "In the
Heart of Maryland" and their
closing bill was "A Fatal Coin."
Each production brought a pack
ed house, and if any one went
away dis-satisfied they have not
yet made the fact known.
This Company will play a re-
Iturn engagement here on Friday
and Saturday, night February i

Southwest Automobile Race
February first at 8:30 a. m. car
No. 1, will leave Liberal, on the
start for the best and most rapid
automobile road race ever staged
over the smooth, level prairie
country of Southwest Kansas.
The route will be from Liberal,
North to the Cimarron River,
thence east passing just north of
Plains, through Fowler, and turn
north at Miuneola, thence to
Dodge City, then over the New
Santa Fe trail, through Cimarron
to Garden City, thence directly
south through Santa Fe, to Lib
eral, The course is about 225
miles, will be a continuous run
start to finish, and judging from
the time made over this course
in the race of December, 1915,
when more than seventy miles
was made, at times, and an av
erage of over forty for the entire
run, it is confidently expected
that a terrific pace will be requir
ed to win this race, and all the
former racers will compete in
this some of them with better
cars, and all with more exper
ience, each determined to do his
utmost to annex the best prizes
he can secure. The total of
prizes will approximate $500.00
or more, and will be divided 0
per cent, 30 per cent and 10 per
cent.
This is esentially a dealer's
race, although others will enter.
Stock cars of six cylinders or
less, stripped if desired, and run
just as fast as the driver cares
to. Each car will bear a number,
and the number and time of
leaving Liberal will be phoned
loathe principal towns along the
route, each car will be checked
with its number, and time of
passing, at Minneola, Dodge City
and Garden City, and the infor
mation phoned to Liberal, where
it will be shown on the bulletin
board. When cars arrive at Lib
eral, the checking stations will
be advised giving the time each
car has needed in the race.

ly in promoting this race. He
ivill be official starter, and every
time bis "Forty-five" cracks, a
racer will dash under the wire,
and disappear at a sixty mile
clip. The staging of this race
