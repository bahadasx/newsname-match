SIDNEY WINS ONE MORE
rtlditey If. H. Take Fast Basket Hall
(oine from Alliance A. II.
S. Second Team Wins
Last Friday evening, in the first,
league game of the season, the Sidney
high school basket ball team won
from the Alliance boys in a fast and
hard-fought game, score 13-12. The
Alliance boys showed that they could
outplay their opponents but showed
It too late in the gar-'. Pr.rks,
guard on the Sidney team, won the
game for the visitors in the last five
seconds of play. Alliance was one
point ahead up to that time, when by
a quick play Parks secured the ball
and tossed goal, counting two points.
The Alliance team started out
playing hard but displaying little
team work. At one time daring the
flrrt half the Bcore stood 8 to 1 In
favor of Sidney. At the end of tn
first half the score was 9 to 4.
In the second half the Alliance
-aggregation came back with team
work and fast playing that was be
wildering to their opponents and ev
en to the spectators. Up until the
last few seconds of play it looked aa
though Alliance would carry off the
honors of the game, but by a quick
past the game was won for Sidney.
The lineup of the Alliance teaai
was aa follows: Lester Harvey
(eapt.), center; Donald Spencer and
Floyd Lotspeieh, forwards; Ira
Wright and George Fennlng, guards;
Bverett O'Keefe and Philip Groves,
subs.
The Alliance H. S. second team al
so showed their ability, by winning
over the bunch of Sidney men, who
appeared to be giants in ajie when
lined up beside the local team. Their
aise, however, proved worthless, as
they displayed little science and
knowledge of the game. The score
at the end of this game waa: Alliance
7, Sidney . The lineup waa aa fol
lows: Oral Harvey, center; Johnnie
Phillips and Leon Edwards, for
wards, and James Burna and Ray
Butler, guarda.
The gymnasium was packed with
enthusiastic fans, who have reason
to feel proud of the good showing
the Alliance boys made, considering
the fact that Sidney haa practically
the same team that played last year,
while Alliance haa oaly one man wbc
aa bad previoua experience on the
team.
A Rpeelal Meeting of the Retentive
Committee of the Nebraska
rreas to lie Held
Horace M. Davis, president of the
Nebraska Press Association, has call
ed a special meeting of the executive
committee to be held at Hastings
Saturday evening, January 29. The
main purpose of the meeting is to de
cide where the 1916 convention is to
be held.
Attorney William Uttrhle, Jr., of
Bridgeport, who was appointed by
the Associated Commercial Clubs of
Western Nebraska to represent
them, will meet with the board and
extend to them an invitation to come

with plans made at the meeting in
Omaha last spring. The citizens of
Scottsbluff have subscribed 11,000
towards paying the expenses of
ringing the convention west; Alli
ance will help, Crawford and Chad
roa will help, and it is believed that
enough money can be raised to pay
the extra expense.

NEW RATES IN .EFFECT
Slight Increase In Passenger llate
on the Western I toads for In
terstate BUhlltCWS
An increase in the passenger rates
for intcr-state traffic went into effect
on most of the western railroads last
week. The increase is small and
will be practically unnoticed except
by tourists taking long Journeys.
Plans, if there were any, on the
part of the railroad companies to in
crease their rates within the limits
of the state were frustrated a few
days ago when, upon application of
Attorney General Willis E. Reed, the
supremo court of the state of Nebras
ka granted a temporary injunction
restraining them from making any
increase. A hearing was set for
February 7, at which time It Is
thought the Injunction will be made
perpetual.
On some of the short run eut of
Alliance there la but very little dif
ference. The new rate to Denver Is
$6.64. the old rate $6.30, making an
Increase of only 34 cents.
Owing to the recent change In pas
senger service to Casper, the passen
ger service being established over the
new route which had been used for
several month for freight business,
the new rate to Casper, based on the
Increased scale, 1 slightly leea than
the old rate over the old route. The
new rate to Casper la $6.67, the old
rate $6.61, a reduction of 16 eenta.
The rate to other point east and
north from Alliance are shown below.
Old New In-
rate rate crease
To Billings IS. SI 13.5$ .07
St. Louis 17.14 20.26 3.12
Chicago 18.63 22.11 3.62
St. Joseph 10.62 12.64 2.02
Kansas City 11.86 14.18 3.32
Edgexont 2.53 2.70 .17
The western railroads had been
striving for an increase la rates for
several yeara but permission waa on
ly recently granted by the Inter-state
Commerce Commission. The Increase
is based on the higher cost of living
for railroad, the road ahowing that
with labor, material and equipment
l.lgher, It is essential that they get
more from the traveling public.
Head-on Collision of Passenger and
Freight on Burlington Main Lin
Near Atlanta, Nebraska
Five trainmen were killed and
four trainmen and three passengers
Injured aa the result of a head-on col
lision between Burlington passenger
train No. 7 and freight train No. 2043
iu a deep cut three miles west of At
lanta Nebr., Monday afternoon.
The dead are:
John Eckman, freight engineer,
McCook, Nebr.
. i Moll, freight fireman, Mc
Ccok. Carl Neubauer, freight brakeman,
Hildreth.
Lee 11. Fogg, passenger fireman,
Lincoln.
James F. Duffy, passenger engin
eer. Lincoln.
The Injured:
F. R. Qulnn, passenger brakeman,
Lincoln; slightly injured.
W. M. Iawson. baggageman, Lin
coln; slightly injured.
J. E. Lowtry Bagley, la., passen
ger; slightly Injured.
O. K. Porter, mall clerk, Lincoln;
seriously Injured.
T. C. Bell, passenger conductor,
Lincoln; slightly injured.
J. R. Mnssman, Hastings, passen
ger: slightly bruised.
Mrs. H. S. Fuller, Oxford, passen
ger; shoulder dislocated.
Unofficial announcements place the
blame of the wreck on the freight
crew. That train, it Is said, should
have taken the siding at Mascot, five
miles west of the wreck, and thus
cleared the way for passenger train
No. 7. which is said to have left At
lanta on a clear track. An official
Investigation Is being made and until
this Investigation is completed the
officials refuse to place any responsi
bility for the wreck.
Both trains were running at a good
rate of speed. No. 7, the passenger,
left Atlanta two minutes behind time
and was probably running at about
li: miles au bour at thj : iiiie of the
collision.
The trains met on a reverse curve
in a deep cut and both engine crews
were caught at their posts. The pas
senger train was running down grade
and Its sneed was little if any slack
ened at the time cf the impact, which
piled the wreckage high in the cut.
!Thc freight was lightly loaded with
but four cars, and hence waa running
fast. .
Relief calls brought first aid from
Atlanta, from where Dr. L. M.
Smernboff and several men pressed a
.'.ollne handcar into service. A re
lief train waa sent from ' Holdrege
and a wrecker from McCook.
The bodies of Fogg. Eckman and
Neubauer were removed from the
wreckage with little difficulty. En
gineer Duffy of the passenger train
was found alive and hurried with the
other Injured to Holdrege, where he
died a little jfier 7 in the evening.
The body of Moll, however, was
not recovered until late in the night.
Bodies of the dead were taken first
to Holdrege. The bodies of Moll
and Eckman were later removed to
their homes at McCook, and that of
Neubauer to his home at Hildreth.
It took till late yesterday to clear
the wreckage, the main line trains
belni detoured In the meantime to
the Republican valley from Hastings
to Red Cloud.
