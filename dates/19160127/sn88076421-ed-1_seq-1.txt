IVERSITY PASSED AWAY SAT­
URDAY FROM HEART TROU-
BLE.
4
Dr. Webster Merrifield, for 25 years
instructor and president of the North
Dakota state university, passed away
suddenly from heart trouble at his
home in Pasadena* Cal., Saturday. Dr.
Merrifield resigned his position sev
eral years ago and had been
California since. He did a wonderful
work for the North Dakota school and
thousands of old students and other
friends sincerely regret his demise.
He was not only a great student and
instructor, but he was the friend of
every student who attended the um
versity during the time he was con­
nected with it. He cultivated their
acquaintance and made them feel that
he had a personal interest in their
welfare.

Well Drillers Had Great Convention.
B. A. Keith of Berthold returned
Saturday from the state convention of
well-drillers which was in session at
Devils Lake for three days last week.
The North Dakota association is the
only organization of the kind in ex­
istence so far as known. Five profes­
sors from the University addressed
the gathering on matters pertaining to
the geological formation of various
secitons of the state. A number of rep­
resentatives of companies engaged
in the manufacture of well drilling
tools and machinery were present, as
well as several parties from South
Dakota who are anxious to organize
the well drillers of that state. The
secretary reported the receipt of num­
erous communications from other
states in reference to the work of the
organization. Minot was selected as
the place for holding the meeting next
year. In conversation with Mr. Keith
ne informs us that during the past
summer he drilled wells totaling 2800
feet in depth, without the loss of a
single well. He will operate two out­
fit's this coming season.

duction.
John J. Crowe, alias John J. Mc
Guire, was arrested at Fargo, charged
with attempting to abduct a sixteen
year-old girl, employed in a Fargo
store. He wrote a letter to the girl

ness and that she could do much better
than working for $6 a week. He want­
ed the girl to run away with him. The
girl turned the letter over to her
mother. Crowe is said to be a profes­
sional gambler and an all around bad
man.
Young Woman Injured at Normal
Laboratory.
Quite a serious accidient occurred at
the laboratory of the Minot Normal
school Wednesday, while one of the
young women was experimenting with
a problem in chemistry. Hydrogen
had been placed in a bottle, which
should have been wrapped inside a
towel. There was a terrific explosion
and the bottle was broken to atoms.
A jagged piece of glass struck the
young woman on the bridge of the
nose, squarely between the eyes, cut­
ting a gash that required several
stitches, two other students received
slight injuries.

Minot Pharmacist is Dead.
John Edgar, who has been employ­
ed as pharmacist in several drug
stores in this city and of late in the
drug store at Glenburn died in the
apartments of his brother W. C. Ed­
gar, clerk of the Windsor hotel, Mon­
day afternoon. The deceased was
thirty years of age and had a host of
friends in this city. The remains were
taken to Tracy, Minn., for interment.
Mr. and Mrs. Henry Gieselman of
Donnybrook returned on Wednesday
from an extended trip through Minne­
sota, where for the past six weeks
they have been visiting relatives and
friends. Henry says North Dakota
leads Minnesota in practically every
particular. Land in Minnesota &
largely farmed by renters who pay
all the way from $4 to $8 per acre'
rental, and the crops,, raised are in
many respects inferior to: those of
North Dakota. Minnesotans are skep­
tical of North Dakota's claims as a
corn producing state. Gieselman took
orders for seed barley and oats and
will ship a quantity soon. In the vi­
cinity of Heron Lake there are three
townships that are being drained at
an expense of $1,500,000.
Sheriff McLean of Bottineau county
had an experience last Thursday
that he would not care to live over
again for considerable money, nor
many political honors. He had been
down in the southeastern part of the
county on official business and waited
at Tasco. a siding on the Soo line be­
tween Omemee and Overly, to catch
a train into Omemee. After waiting
until about four in the morning a
train finally came rumbling along, but
refused to stop even for signal. Being
almost overcome with the fearful cold,
the sheriff was compelled to tramp
thru the snow a mile and a half to the
nearest farm house, where he secured
a team and reached Omemee just at
daybreak. His face was badly frozen
from the night-long exposure, but a
generous application of snow and
other restoratives prevented what
might easily have been serious re­
sults.
The C. J. Barth pool hall, the Par
shall Post and H. O. Free's barber
shop burned to the ground Monday
evening. There was a heavy north­
west wind and had it not been for the
heavy covering of snow on the lumber
piles of the Bovey-Shute Lumber Co.,
the entire town would have gone up in
flames. Parshall is without fire pro­
tection of any description. The loss
was not great owing to the fact that
all the buildings consumed were small
wooden structures.
Chas. Peters, a prosperous farmer
living north of the city, returned from
his old home, Frankfort, 111., where he
visited five weeks. He reports ex­
ceedingly bad weather, there being
much rain a portion of the time and
the thermometer registered 10 below
the last week of his visit. The farmers
in Illinois did not raise a good crop
last year, much of the oats rotting ana
the corn was very soft.
Thomas Baker, Jr., a prominent in­
surance man of Fargo, died Monday
morning from apoplexy. He was a
well known Mason and politician, hav­
ing been speaker of the house during
one legislative session. He was 57
years of age and located in Fargo in
1880.
Dr. Wheelon has established new
offices in the opera house block. Room
10, Phone 674. The doctor, who lost
all his effects in the recent fire, has
gone to Minneapolis to buy a complete
new equipment.
THE WARD COUNTY INDEPENDENT
THE INDEPENDENT HAS THE LARGEST CIRCULATION OF ANY WEEKLY PAPER IN THE STATE
PIPER-HOWE CO.
WILL BUILD
WILL CONSTRUCT LARGE BRICK
BLOCK EARLY IN SPRING FOR
WAREHOUSE AND GENERAL
OFFICES.
The Piper-Howe Lumber Co. is hav­
ing plans drawn for a large two-story
office building and warehouse to be
built on their property in this city
just as soon as work can start in the
spring.
The company recently bought three
lots joining their property to the
north, giving them the complete strip
between the Great Northern and the
Soo railways. They thus secure
trackage along both lines.
They will build a fine brick struc­
ture 40x140 feet, the first floor to be
used for their warehouse and the sec­
ond floor for their general offices. The
improvements that will be made in the
spring will cost $25,000.
Building the new warehouse will
result in the company shipping to this
city in the neighborhood of 30 car
loads of extra material annually, to
be distributed to their 43 yards locat­
ed in North Dakota and Montana. The
material to be shipped in consists of
building paper, wall board, lime, ce­
ment, plaster, maple flooring, etc. The
company has ordered thirty-five car­
loads of extra material for the local
yard, as with the increased room, they
will be able to carry a much larger
stock than ever.
The Piper-Howe Lumber Co. has
been located in this city during the
past five years and during that time,
the concern has grown very rapidly.
They have determined to make this
city their permanent headquarters.
The company has been located in the
state for the past nine years, the of­
fices being located at Bottineau before
being removed to this city.
Twenty-five employes, mostly mar­
ried men, are on the pay roll in this
city, the total pay roll in'Minot being
$3,000 per month, while the pay roll
for all the yards owned by the com­
pany amounts to $12,000 a month.
R. J. Piper is the general manager.
He is a young businessman of excep­
tional ability and he has shown won­
derful capacity for hard work. L. H.
Piper, who h»s had charge of the local
yard for several years, has-been made
assistant general manager^ a position
which he has well earned. E. C. Brit
tin, who was employed by the com­
pany at Sherwood for five years, has
came to this city to manage the local
yard. He bears an excellent reputa­
tion as a lumber dealer and personally
is a fine fellow.
The Piper-Howe Lumber Co. is cap­
italized for $500,000.

FUND RAISED TO FEED
STARVING CHICKENS.
Burlington, N. D., Jan. 27.—
The prairie chickens are coming
into town in such numbers that
some of the kindly disposed
among our citizens contributed
to a fund to purchase grain to
feed them. The grain is placed
around at convenient points
where the chickens are inclined
to gather. This may seem rath­
er preposterous, but it is a fact,
nevertheless. The deep snow
has completely covered old straw
stacks, weeds and other sources
of supply and as a consequence
they are obliged to invade the
haunts of man to find sustenance.

LOCAL SCOTS HONOR
ENJOYABLE GATHERING AT
ELKS' HOME—SPLENDID PRO­
GRAM INCLUDING ADDRESS
BY JUDGE BRUCE AND PRESI­
DENT CRANE.
The 157th anniversary of the birth
of Robert Burns was celebrated in
Minot last Tuesday evening by the
local Scots and their friends. The
beautiful Elks' Home was placed at)
their disposal by the Exalted Ruler,
Doctor Pence, and his committee. The
following were present:
Mr. Wm. Hetherton and wife, Col.
Alex. Scarlett and wife, Hon. Judge
Bruce, Rev. P. W. Erickson and wife,
Mr. John Campbell and wife, Mr. W.
D. Campbell, Mr. A. F. McLane and
wife, Mr. W. L. Miller and wife, Mrs.
Murray, Mr. J. C. Smallwood and
wife, Mr. C. F. Truax and wife, Mrs.
J. W. Norbeck and husband, Miss Ber­
tha Stewart, Mr. N. D. Davidson and
wife, Mr. Ramford, Miss Stewart, Mrs.
Lock man, Mr. and Mrs. R. W. DuVall.
Rev. MaeKenzie and wife, Miss Ida
Cooper. Mrs. Anna Cooper, Andrew
Fri.zer, Mr.- L. Gilroy and wife, Mr.
John C. Bain. Pres. and Mrs. Crane,
Dr. Semple.'
The Club this year departed from
the usual custom and had supper prior
to the programme and it is needless
to say that the ladies' committee in
charge of the supper had an ample
spread laid out on the table in the
lodgeroom of the Elk's Home and Mr.
E. L. Rowan steward of the Home,
had the table artistically arranged
with flowers. The following is the bill
of fare placed on the table:
Haggis Sausage Rolls
Meat Loaf Scalloped Potatoes
Fruit. Salad
Oat Takes- Short Bread
Scotch Scones
Celery Pickles Cheese
Cake Jelly Tea Coffee
After supper the entire company
assembled in the parlors where the
President, Mr. Wm. Hetherton. open­
ed the proceedings by asking the en­
tire company to sing "There Was a
Lad Was Born in Kyle," after which
he gave a toast to +he immortal mem­
ory of Robert Burns. He said:
"Burns took up the pen with the
sagie grasp that he took hold of the
plough, and he produced "A Man's a
$'j for a' That," teaching his! fellows
how to stand on their feet, and sowing
the seeds which are today bearing
good fruit, for what was the cry for
manhood suffrage and the extension
of the franchise but a re-echo of
"That man to man, the world o'er,
Shall brithers be for a' that!"
and in reality our reformers—men of
light and learning—are but putting
into practical shape the grand idea
of equality which the poet suggested
in his ennobling lyric. Burns takes
up the Scottish lyre and makes it echo
re-echo boldly and defiantly. Who will
say that Burns has not helped in the
grand mission of elevating manhood
and adding to the sum of human hap­
piness.
"Had Burns been treated more kindly
and considerately by his contempor­
aries, had he been made less the lion
Mail Carrier Burned to Death.
In order to keep warm, Geo. Cairns,
a mail carrier and freighter between
Fort Clark and Center, N. D.. pulled
his bed up close to the fire at a livery
barn at Fort Clark. The clothes
caught fire and the man was suffocat­
ed. The barn was destroyed togeth­
er with seven horses.
—Berrymen in Washington
of a passing day in the capital of
Scotland, how different might the
closing chapters of his life have been.
Burns was a member of the Dum­
fries Volunters and in order to stimu­
late their patriotism he wrote a song
which is known to us all:
"Does haughty Gaul invasion threat
Then let loon's be
wore, Sir
We have wooden walls upon our
seas,
And volunteers on shores, Sir.
"At the end of the poem Burns gave
the best advice that could be given
under the circumstances to anyone:
"Be Britons still to Briton true,
Among ourselves united.
For never but by British hands,
Can British wrongs be righted.
When Burns was dying he was re­
moved to the Village of Brow on the
Solvvay. Before starting he said to
Jean, "Don't be afraid, I'll be more re­
spected a hundred years after I am
dead than I am now Never was
prophecy more amply fulfilled. Allan
Cunningham tells us that when it was
known that Burns was dying, the
town was like a besieged place no­
thing was talked of but the national
loss. The last scene of all saw Jessie
Lewurs, the ministering angel, at the
poet's bedside. His wife soon to be a
mother, was prostrated with grief.
Maxwell was loyal to the last.
"Robert Burns was buried in the
Auld Kirkyard with military honours,
two regiments took part, and few men
have had such sincere mourners as
were the people of Dumfries Scot­
land's poet rose into notice like the
sun from behind a cloud, and his woik
and his name can never die.
The following program was then
ti'ken up, and every number was ren­
dered in a very efficient manner, which
called forth much appreciation from
the entire assembly:
Song, Wm. Hetherton.
Address—Rev. W\ C. Huntei.
Song—Mrs. Pence.
Dialogue—Mr. Wheel ei* leading.
Song—Mrs. MaeKenzie.
Address—Judge Murray.
Song—Mrs. Hart Swalstead.

Piano Selections—Mrs. Scarlett.
Reading—Mrs. Murray.
Song—Mrs. Erickson.
Reading—Mrs. Campbell.
Song—Mrs. Frank Roach.
Address—Pres. A. G. Crane.
Then dancing and Auld Lang byne.
Manv new members were added to
the roll of the Club and, as Judge
Bruce said, there is no club which can
surpass the Burns club for its general
efficiency and up-to-dateness. ihe
Judge was certainly at his best and
made an impressive address which was
well received.
Dancing the old Scotch reels and
the Highland dances were enjoyed by
all and in parting the company form­
ed a circle and with clasped hands
sang the parting ode, Auld Lang Syne.
The following communications were
received by the Club secretary:
Grand Forks, N. D.y Jan. 24th, 19lfi.
Colonel Alex Scarlett,
Minot, N. D.
Mv Dear Colonel:
Tomorow is Burns Day, and 1 want
vou to at least have a line from me
to know that my heart is with you on
this day that is dear to the hearts ot
all Scotchmen.
Our board of directors meet today,
and my connection with the Herald will
be severed this week. After that 1
will be at liberty to come and see
mv friends. With kind regards to
Mrs. Scarlett, I am,
Yours sincerely,

Colonel Alex Scarlett,
Minot, N. D.
Mv Dear Colonel:
Your favor of the 19th extending
an invitation to attend the Burns cel­
ebration at Minot on the 25th with
intimation that I might be called on
to speak on that occasion is received.
I have another engagement on that
date which will preclude my being
there.
My regret is all the more keen be­
cause there is so much that is inspir­
ing in Scottish history that I feel,
tho a poor talker myself, even I could
find myself able to say something con­
cerning a few of the things humanity
owes to the dauntless courage, devo­
tion, high ideals and sturdy worth of
Scotia's sons and daughters.
Tho not able to be with you in the
flesh, I shall most certainly be with
you in spirit, so wishing you and all
those fortunate enough to be able to
attend, an enjoyable session, I am,
Sincerely yours,
J. H. FRAINE.

Dear Friends:
We are having a fine trip. We ex­
pect to reach New Orleans on Sunday.
Wish we could be with you for the
Haggis, etc. Hope you will have a
fine time. The weather here is like
May.

DIRECTORS OF ASSOCIATION OF
COMMERCE MEET AND ORGAN­
IZE FOR 1916—W. K. PORTER IS
NEW PRESIDENT—NUMBER OF
NEW MEMBERS ADMITTED.
The new board of directors of the
Minot Association of Commerce met
at the office of the Association Friday
and organized for the ensuing year by
electing the following oflicets.
President—M. R. Porter.
1st Vice Pres.—E. S. Person.
2nd Vice Pres.—A. G. Jacobson.
Treasurer—-E. A. Long.
Secretary—Will E. Holbein.
Applications of five new members
were read and upon motion were ac-
°eThe following budget committee
was appointed'for the ensuing year:
W. R- Porter, J. C. Smallwood, Ira
Wight, F. B. Lambert, Wm. Bun­
nell, E. S. Person, A. G. Jacobson.
The matter of the Equity packing
plant was thoroughly discussed. On
account of Chairman Roell being very
busv getting his business matters
shaped up on account of the disastrous
fire that destroyed his building and
stock, it was decided to add two new
members to the Committee and relieve
Mr. Roell of the chairmanship, but he
wili still remain a member of the com­
mittee. The two new members ap­
pointed were F. B. Lambert, chair­
man, and T. P. Mulick. The committee
is now comprised of Messrs. Lambert,
Roell, Smallwood, Halvorson and Mu­
lick. This committee was instructed
to take full charge and secure all nec­
essary information for the Equity
committee's guidance.
The matter of instituting a member­
ship campaign was then taken up and
it was moved, seconded and carried
that three captains be selected by the
president, these captains to each
choose five men to compose a Member­
ship-Getting Team, the losing team to
be subject to the penalty of buying
dinner for the winning team. Tuesday,
Feb. 1st, was chosen for this member­
ship campaign, and it is expected that
a large number will be added to the
Association of Commerce. During the
past two years there has been a large
number of new business and profes­
sional men come to Mniot. and as they
should be working for a greater city,
it is not expected that the teams will
have very much trouble in rolling up a
large membership.
Beginning Tuesday, Feb. 1st, the
board of directors will hold regular
meetings every two weeks, as there is
a vast amount of work to be accom­
plished during the coming year.
Everything looks mighty bright fror*
the Association of Commerce stand­

doubt they will draw a crowded house,
Iiural mail carriers are having all
sorts of trouble these days. The im­

and millions of Americans are contribut­
ing to a fund to be sent to Russia for
the relief of the many Jewish people
who are Innocent sufferers on account of
the war. Millions of dollars have been
contributed to this fund by citizens
without regard to race or creed. Minot
sends a fund of nearly $600. The Jew­
ish people In Poland are in a starving
condition. One dollar will keep the

and not miss it.
