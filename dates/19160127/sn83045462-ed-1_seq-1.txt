SUFFRAGIST QUIZ
Executive Declines Courteously
to Reply to Queries of
Mrs. Mary Beard.
TELLS WOMEN STATES
SHOULD SETTI F OIIFSTION
In Addressing Clergymen. Mr. Wilson
Tells of Efforts to Maintain
Peace by This Country.
XKW YORK. January 27.?
President Wilson refused today
to support the movement for an
amendment to the federal Constitution
providing for woman suf-;
frage. lie spoke briefly to 200
members of the Congressional
L'nion for Woman Suffrage, and
told them that be felt the suffrage
question should be dealt with bv
each individual vfatr
The President received the suffragists
after they had waited for him more
than an hour at the Waldorf-Astoria
Hotel, which he made his headquarters
on his arrival here this morning from
Washington prepared to make three
addresses during the day.
Efforts made by Mrs. Mary Beard,
wife of a Columbia University professor,
to cross-examine the President on
liis position met with failure. He refused
courteously to reply to her queries.
The President apologized to the women
for not seeing them earlier, but
told them he bad been at work since
arriving in New York. He added that
"it may be that my mind works slowly,
but ! have always thought that
there were things which should be
t>uilt slowly and therefore made more j
asting. I may be a little old in fash- j
on in my view that the suffrage ques- i
ion should be handled by the state."
The President frankly admitted to 1
he suffragettes that he had promised
several months ago to discuss with the
eaders of Congress the suffrage ques- .
iori. but that other matters of legisation
had come up which he thought '
should take preference over everything
jse. j i
Some Things Cannot Wait. I
"There are things that cannot wait," '
laid the President. "Action in great
constitutional matters must be deliberate."
President Wilson again promised that
le would discuss the subject with mem>?rs
of Congress as soon as possible.
Ae declared, however, that he was still .
onvinced that the suffrage issue should |
>e worked out by the states. He added
hat he saw no reason for the women
o be discouraged by the progress being
nade. y
The President went to the parlor engaged
by the suffragettes and was
greeted with warm applause as he enered.
He shook hands with Mrs. Amos
'inchot, Mrs. Henry Bruere. Mrs. Robert
Adam son and several other leaders. |
Portions of Address Applguded.
Deep silence greeted his reiteration
iddress were marked by applause.
Mrs. Tiffany Dyer, Mrs. Bruere and
Mrs. Beard spoke before the President. rhev
asked that while he was working
>ut his preparedness program he should
ernemher that no scheme of defense
vould be adequate which did not inrlude
the mobilization of women. While
(peaking >n the middle west for naional
defense they asked that he also
idvocate woman suffrage. The Presilent
reminded the women that he had
oted for suffrage in New Jersey and >romised
that if the question came to ,
t vote there again he would again vote *
or it. f
As the President completed his ad- 1
Iress several women shook hands with <
lim and he returned to his apartment.
Prayers for the President.
The President delivered the first of
his three addresses at noon before the i
lerical conference of the New York
Federation of Churches, representing
ill denominations. Amid hearty ap- 1
rttiiiidp a:m intrnHnr-o/l !.? d<?
,v'. c
Dr. S. Edward Young of Brooklyn,
who remarked that "no other President *
fever had such universal prayer in his t
behalf."
"Only Lincoln bore such heavy re- *
sponsi bill t y," said the clergyman,' "and r
[he America of Lincoln's time held but
one-third as many people to pray and
nearly half were arrayed against him." f
Rev. William B. Martin, in delivertig
an invocation, said that as the repesentative
of Cardinal Farley lie could a
say that the Catholic Church was sup- y.
porting every possible movement for
peace. He praised th" President for r
keeping the United States out of war, *
is did the Rev. Nehemiah Boynton,
who. in an address of welcome, said: j
"We simply want to put ourselves by
your side as you enter upon your work
of being the spokesman for permanent t
peace for America and the world." t
American People for Peace.
The President said he appreciated the
words of the speaker "from the heart."
He declared that in his efforts for peace c
le had represented the "spirit" of the t
"nited States of America. He said he a
<new that in their hearts the people of p
the United States wanted to "keep the t
balance even."
'I can find no basis for peace but
justice," he added. "The greatest force a
n this world is character, and I be- 1
ieve that character can be expressed n
by the acts of a nation. This is ex- ?
pressed by the attitude of the people. 1

James Ramsay MacDonald, socialist a

POLITICIANS ON TRIP
/Vill Hold No Conferences With Si
Party Leaders While on
Preparedness Tour.
President Wilson does not wish any | K
olitical conferences while he is away Sw
n his trip through the middle west, Icoi
irhich begins tomorrow night. As far I Po
s possible the' Pfefcictent "wants to I cot
void the appearance of politics in this Wj
ourney.and the next one,'when he is str
xpected to go much farther west and th?
o take in some southern cities, includ- thi
ng Louisville, which already has been fer
ut upon the list. Kii
That the trip, primarily intended to Ja<
rouse sentiment in favor of prepared- mi;
ess, naturally will have about it po- Ku
itical phases of importance, is candidy
admitted.
The President has not been in that <j
tart of the country since he entered ab
he White House, and his friends have p0j
iamored ror hiin to get among tho lin
teopl . He could not have made the jnt
ourney for strictly political reasons, riv
ither as a candidate for the nomina
ion of his party or as a candidate for
e-election, without subjecting, himself ^
o severe criticism. But- the people he die
peaks to will be looking into the face le?
f the next democratic cahdidate and
hey will think almost as much about Pe'
his as about the subject he speaks on of
o them. H
The political echoes of the trip will
tfract the politicians far more than ?*
he voice of the people on prepared- eqi
less. How was he received? What the
id the people say? Are they standing
>y him or talking against him? Dcm- V
cratic and republican leaders will be gin
eeking answers to these and many ^ro
ther questions.
The President, however, is desirous ^.a
f putting far aside all political favors, c"a
nrl attemnts to have him meet with
emocratic politicians to confer about
onditions in the states passed through
re not liable to succeed. Some of
liese attempts already have been made un<
nd have failed. The President's time lap
r>r such conferences will be exceeding- A ,
V short anyhow. In all cities in which
e stops he will be in the hands of the tra
>eal committees in charge. His time sen
ill be allotted by the committees,
xcept such as he needs for his per- t^e
onal convenience. mQl
On the railroads, between stopping
laces, he will be thinking about the
emarks he is to make at the next
lace and dictating to his stenographer
uch messages to the White House and y
ther places as he is compelled to give ?ph(
ttention to. Members of local comhnardintr
