LAST WEEK
PORTLAND FOLK SPORT IN SNOW
Jaunts of Snowshoe Club and Ski Club
Men Made Pleasant by Courtesies
of Railway Men
For the past two years members oi
the Portland Y. M. C. A. Ski Club
have extolled the play fields on the
snow on the north base of Mount Hood.
Since the winter of 1910 the Portland
Snowshoe club has journeyed in a body
to the snug winter clubhouse, which,
constructed of hewn logs well mortised
together, stands near Cloud Cap Inn
like some Colonial blockhouse or fort
ress, except that the boles in the walls
for sharpshooters have been elimin
ated. However, to judge of the pleasures
that the members of both organiza
tions who returned to Portland Sunday
afternoon by special car over the O.
W. It. & N. line, have experienced on
their annual jaunt to the snowflelds
this week, the popularity of winter
sports week, the popularity of winter
sports on the mountainside will be
made greater than ever before. And
in years to come it is predicted that it
will be just as much "the thing" to
see the giant snow drifts, the ice cas
cades of the glaciers, and seraces and
the snow bridge-covered crevasses by
winter as by Bummer.
The Snwoshoe Club men journeyed to
their annual mid-winter retreat on
Wednesday of last week, after having
spent a time in training on the tobog
gan and steep hillsides near Homer A.
Rogers' Mount Hood Lodge. For three
days they were buried in the National
forest, cut off from communication
from the outside world, but withal ex
tremely comfortable at their club
quarters, discussing in the evening by
trie roaring log fire the thrills of the
day or the beauties of wintertime nat
ure that mortals Icbs bold have. not
been privileged to see.
The Y. M. C. A. party arrived at
Rogers' Lodge on Thursday aftenroon.
The members of the outing party
declare that their first trip was made
doubly pleasant because of the courte
sies extended them by the officials of
the O.-W. R. & N. Co. arid the Mt.
Hood Railway Co. On Thursday morn
ing the outing party were the guests
of William McMurray, genreal passen
ger agent of the former company,
aboard his private car here. Mr. Mc
Murray accompanied the pleasure seek
ers as far as Parkdale. Ashley Wilson,
superintendent of the local line, also
accompanied the Y. M. C. A. party,
providing every available comfort. The
Mt. Hood line furnished a special train
for the Snowshoe club from this city to
Parkdale last Tuesday.
On Thursday, when the Ski Club
members were en route from Parkdale
to the Mount Hood Lodge, traveling in
a battery of sleighs, a halt was called
at the Valley Crest school, taught by
Miss Margaret Macnamara, of Port
land. Because of the deep snow and
frigid weather but eight of the hardier
students of Miss Macnamara were in
attendance. Without formality the
Portland men filed in at the schoolhouse
door and took their seats at the empty
desks. Unabashed by the presence of
so many visitors, Miss Macnamara re
linquished her rod of authority to A.
m. unlley, physical director oi ine x.
M. C. A., who took temporary charge
of the school aud delivered a short
speech to the eight faithful students.
"Jhis incident, "declares k. h. At
kinson, city ticket agent of the O.-W.
K. & IS. Co. at Portland, "was one oi
the pleaeantest of the entire trip, and
to most of us brought back, vividly,
memories of our own childhood spent
in some rural district."
The Ski club members spent Friday
on short excursoina in the neighborhood
of the Lodge, relieveing "Charlie hors
es" contracted on the day before and
training for the long hike to Cloud Cap
Inn yesterday, when a visit was made
to the clubhouse of the snowshoe men
and thence to the scenic vantage points
at the foot of Eliot glacier. One of
the worst sufferers from a "charlie
horse" was W. J. Hoffman.
The Y. M. C. A. party had three pop
ular mascots: Mrs. Gordon Raymond,
Lloyd Jaeger and Allen Hoffman.
The personnel of the Ski club party
was as follows: A. M. Grilley, E.J
Webb, Mr. and Mrs. G. B. Raymond,
Robert E. Hitcbie, J. Harold Miner,
N. A. Coleman. M. H. Barnes, Chas.
W. Warner, F. H. Kiser, Arthur M.
Prentiss, C. W. Howard, R. H. Atkin
son, J. P. Jaeger and son, Lloyd, J. P.
Placeman, Harold L. Wald and W. J.
Hoffman and son, Allen. The following
were the members of the Snowshoe
club: J. Wesley Ladd, Dom Zan, Wal
ter B. Honeyman, Horace Mecklim, R.
P. Effiner, J. A. Doughtery. Guy W.
Talbot, Rodney L. Glisan, D. H. Ste
phenson, Herbert Nichols, C. E. Ore lie,
11. C. Lewis nad D. T. Honeyman.
A remarkable feat was accomplished
by Mr. Wald, a member of the Y. M.
C. A. party, who, on his arrival here
from Portland at 1 :B5 Thursday morn
ing, set out immediately for Parkdale
on skis, arriving at 8:30 o'clock thor
oughly exhausted - from his 30-mile
jaunt.
PAULIIAMUS GIVES
VIEWS ON COUNCIL
To delegates to the growers' council:
This is the time designated for the an
nual meeting of the Growers' council
hut in conference with Truman Butler
of Hood River, one of the members of
the Executive Committee, we have de
cided that in our judgement it would
be best to hold our meeting in abey
ance until Messrs. Bassett, Moomaw
and Kerr, of the Department of Mar
kets, have completed their Jinvestiga-
tion and make report or what they
believe is the best method of handling
our apple marketing problem.
Aa you know, the Growers Council
movement was called into existence
for the sole purpose of endeavoring to
obtain the right cooperative working
agreement between the selling agencies
and that there in really very little that
the Growers Council can accomplish
except to look after the genera) health
and welfare of their industry. While a
erower shinning through one of the
selling agencies would have' the right
to consultwith that particular telling
agency as to the methods of marketing
fi.ii product, yet De would not oe jusw
fled in asking any questions of tny
other selling agency and our experience
in the past has been that sometimes
the selling agency through which the
individual grower ia marketing bit
products, 'claims that the low pricea
prevailing were attributable to the
actions of competing selling agencies.
This may or may not . be the correct
solution, but if all the growers bad an
organization which would permit them
to send a committee representing all of
the growers to all of the telling agen
cies to investigate the methods of not
only one of the selling agencies but all
of the selling agencies, there would be
some possibility of getting results.
I have been disappointed in the re
sults that we have been able to obtain
up to date for the Growers Council.
Most of the selling agencies have ex
pressed a willingness to work in har
mony with the executive committee of
the Growers Council but I fail to And
that I am able to point to very much
assistance rendered by many of the
selling agencies; that their talk is
stronger than their action. If the
office of markets of the department of
agriculture is willing to join with the
growers in helping solve the marketing
problem, it occurs to me that it would
be very advisable for the growers to
stand back of the office of markets in
working out a satisfactory solution.
Possibly the experience had during the
past year in working out a plan will be
extremely helpful to the growera and
the department of markets in getting a
correct solution of the problem. In
other words by the experience of the
past year, we have all learned of the
absolute necessity of all of the growers
taking an active interest in the Grow
ers Council movement, or other similar
movement, that will give them a fairly
good understanding of their own busi
ness. Many of the delegates to the Tacoma
convention did not organize their dis
tricts in a manner necessary to produce
results in other words, the selling
agencies will listen to the growers just
so long as the growers show a disposi
tion to demand attention but it appears
that the selling organizations are very
largely in control of the situation
rather than the growers themselves,
when, in truth, it is the growers' busi
ness and until such time as the grower
takes general supervision over his own
business, he cannot expect it to be en
tirely successful.
I received a letter from Messrs. Bas
set, Moomaw and Kerr, under date of
January 14, advising that they bad
decided upon a plan and had started for
Washington, D. C, to submit the same
to the Federal Trade Commission and
the office of markets for approval. If
this approval is granted and they come
back to the Pacific Northwest with a
plan, 1 believe that we should all get
back of them and help put it through.
Of course, this particular plan may not
meet with 100 per cent approval in the
minds of the growers, but I don't be
lieve that we should expect such a
plan, but any plan will be better than
no plan at all, as now exists, there
fore, 1 believe it will be advisable to
accept their plan so that we can all
unite upon some one plan and try it
out for a year, after which the wrin
kles can be ironed out.
W. H. Paulhamus, chairman.
SEEDLINCS GROWN
FIRST AT MT. TABOR
The Clark Seedling strawberry, the
famous fruit grown throughout the
Mid-Colmubia fruit district, according
to Geo. T. Prather, was propagated by
a man by the name of Clark, a farmer
of the Mt. Tabor district near Port
end.
The first of the berries ever grown
here were planted by the late B. War
ren, whose family now resides in Port
and. "Mr. Warren brought the berry
plants here in either 1878 or 79," says
Mr. f rather.
"! was acquainted with Mr. Clark.
whose initials I have forgotten. T.
K. Loon later brought the fruit into
commercial prominence."
the yield of Clark seedling straw
berries of the Hond River Valley and
the Underwood and White Salmon dis
tricts of Washington will reach more
than 125 carloads during the coming
spring and summer. The berries are
distributed as far east as Chicago.
The snowfall of the past three
weeks, protecting the plants from the
exceeding cold weather, will also in
sure a plenty of moisture, and growers
are expecting a bumper yield and a
berry of excellent quality the coming
season.
GRANGE MINSTRELS
GET BIG APPLAUSE
The entertainment staged at Pine
Grove Friday evening under the aus
pices of the grange and the manage
ment of F. L. Davidson was a success.
and there was not a dull moment from
the time the curtain arose until the
last number was finished. The first
number was a solo by E. E. House,
who has an excellent voice and is ap
preciated by all who have the good for
tune to hear him. Next came the hit
of the evening, a monologue by J M.
Taylor, in a black face. His "get up"
was so good that scarcely any in the
audience of over two hundred recog
nized him. He was followed by two
popular young people, Wm. Hsskins
and Elizabeth Lacey, who showed ex
cellent talent in the act they put on.
A Xylophone duet by Mr. and Mrs.
D. E. Howland was well rendered and
enjoyed by all present. A. J. Graff
and Harold Sexton appeared in black
face and kept the audience in a roar.
They were brought back four times
and were a whole show by themselves
and worth going miles on a stormy
evening to hear. A solo by Mrs. ,. U.
Dutro was excellent and any commun
ity with such talent as hers ia certainly
fortunate. F. L. Davidson appeared
in the coBtume of a clown. With bis
singing, jokes and dancing everyone
forgot they ever had a worry or care.
When it comes to entertaining Frank
is on a par with the best professionals.
Mrs. E. f. Foils and Miss Gladys Clark
played the piano accompaniments and
were largely responsible for the suc
cess of the program. i
The last but not least number on the
program was a drill and dsnce by five
pickaninnies and the boys certainly
did fine. After the last number the
floor was cleared and for about three
hours dancing was enjoyed by many
present.

GOVERNMENT
WILL ASSIST
STANDARD GRADES ARE PROMISED
Weather Conditions and Marketing Re
forril Cause Coming Year to be
Viewed Optimistically
Except for shipments of export fruit
that have been sent out to catch Trans
Atlantic steamers, business has been
at a standstill here for the past two
weeks of extreme cold weather. While
cars have been well lined and equipped
with insulated, flooring, Wilmer Sieg,
sales manager of the Apple Growers
Association, fears slight frost damage.
"We do not use a heater service." he
says, "for this service is only available
as far as Chicago, and very severe
weather is encountered between that
city and the far eastern points."
1 he cold weather, however, Mr. Sieg
and other officials of the Association
think, will be a benefit to the apple
and pear crop. "It will tend to keep
the buds dormant a longer period."
says Mr. Sieg, "and will probably take
us past those late frosts that cause us
damage here on some seasons. The
local peach crop may be injured, but
plantings of this fruit are very negli
gible."
Because of these propitious weather
conditions and proposed reforms in the
grading oi Northwestern box fruits
next season, the local apple men are
optimistic. According to Mr. Sieg the
government will take a hand in the
standardization of grades, and through
the Bureau of Chemistry, which will
enforce the rulings that are to be
made, buyers can be assured that ap
ples shipped from the Northwest in
1916 will be up tn grade.
"Ihe government has recognized be
yond doubt the standardization of pack
and grade, and the Department of Ag
riculture will accept as the standard
the rules adopted by the majority of
the Northwestern districts," says Mr.
Sieg. "The rulings will be strictly
adhered to and worked out by the or
ganization that will take the place of
the present Shippers' League, which
has postponed any reorganization until
the report and recommendations of the
Office of Markets and Federal Trades
Commission has been received."
"The Northwest," continued Mr.
Sieg, "wants to hold out to buyers an
absolute assurance of quality, and the
united states government is going to
cooperate with us to this end. '
During the past shipping season rep
resentatives of the larger shipping
concerns declare that an irreparable
damage has been caused the North
western box apple by the shipment of
offgrade fruit. Scores of carloads of
wormy and undergrade apples were
shipped to Texas points from Wenat-
chee, causing an avalanche of disaster
for the shippers, themselves, and
bringing into disrepute the district
sending out the fruit.
Hood River, according to Mr. Sieg,
has suffered this season because of oft
grade apples having been shipped to
England by individuals of the Mid-Co-lumbia
district.
With tne exception of a few carloads
of first grade Newtowns, the Fruit
Growers' Exchange reports that its
apple holdings of the 191b crop have
been practically cleaned up. During
the past week several carloads have
been shipped to California and the
Middle West. "While we are not
meeting with any better offers," says
H. M. Huxley, of the Exchange, "we
are finding the demand is getting much
beter.
Kenneth McKay, manager of the
Exchange, has been spending the past
two weeks in Seattle and other coast
cities, conducting a selling campaign.
MAUD POWELL BUYS
MACKINAWS HERE
Accompanied by her husband, H.
Godfrey Turner and her accompanist,
Arthur Lnesser, Maud Powell last Sat
urday visiud the store of Frank A.
Cram, where she purchased two mack
inaws to be sent to friends at White
field, Mass., where her summer home
is located.
"I have never seen a better lot of
stores in a small town in my life,"
said Madame Powell, after walking
down Oak street. "You have as nice
assortment of things that appeal to the
shopper as I have seen in all my trav
els," she told Mr. Cram. "1 have
been intending to send my friends
some mackinaws for snme tiaie. 1
have seen no coats that pleased me
more than yours." Mr. Turner and
Mr. Loesser both bought bills of
goods.
The shopping here of the national
characters was due to the loyalty of
Fred Bailey to his home town.
On frriday Mr. Turner was accom
panying Fred and Harry Bailey on a
journey around the city. They had
planned to entertain him at lunch and
it was proposed that they go to one of
the hotels. "No," said Mr. Turner,
"I want to eat right where you men
take your meals every day." So all
three went to L. V. Driscoll's Mer
chant Lunch, Harry Bailey's custom
ary lunching place.
Mr. Turner liked it so well that he
and his wife returned to the Merchant's
Lunch after the concert of Friday
evening. Ihey also went back on Sat
urday morning and presented to Mr.
Driscoll and his assistants as souvenirs
two dimes to he worn as wstch charms.
Because of the assistance rendered
Fred Bailey in his preparations for the
concert by his sister-in-law, Mrs.
Hsrry Bailey, Madame Powell pre
sented her with a handsome autograph
picture and a gorgeous lot of flowers.
While the breakfast was being cooked
Saurday morning, Madame Powell was
a close inspector. It will be remem
bered that Driscoll installed electric
ranges at bis place. "1 am going to
have iust such a kitchen as that in
stalled at my home," said Madame
Powel. "I haven't seen anything quite
so convenient."
Sidewalks Damaged
Frost has badly damaged numerous
stretches of concrete sidewalks in the
city, water aoaked joints of the side
walks having been lifted as Qiuch aa
four inches in places by expansion.
In places the sidewalks have the ap
pearance of roofs of houses, and the
edges of the composition of cement and
rock are crumbling away.
