BERLIN, Jan. 27.?The Cologne
Volks Zeitung publishes a despatch
from Cairo stating that the Rritish
in southern Arabia are In a danger- j
ous position as a result of fierce at- i
tacks by Arabs and Turks. It is!
tated the British casualties up to!
December 30 amounted to 15,000
killed and 20,000 wounded.
The number of British troops now
at Aden Is given as 20.000.
Quoting from the Volkes Zeitung,
the Overseas News Agency says:
"A wounded British major declares
at the beginning of the war
the British were In possession of 250,000
square kilometers In Arabia, all
of which has been lost. All the Arab
chiefs joined the Turks and are now
using successfully against the British
the arms supplied by them." (
Reports from France and Flanders
say that a favorable turn in the
weather had been followed by active (
fighting on the entire western front.
Along the whole line the roar of artillery
1b heard but the heaviest fighting
has been in the vicinity of Nleuport
to the north of Ypres and in
the Argonne.
German patrolling parties brought
back word that German artillery had
done effective work against trenches
of the Allies near Nieuport. The
British artillery, It is said, was hardly
less active than that of the Germans.
On one section of the front
the British fired 1,700 shrapjiel
shells, 700 high explosive shells and i
about the same number of bombs
within a period of twenty-four hours.
The mine explosions mentioned in
Tuesday's official bulletin of the German
war office were four In number.
The Germans immediately occupied
the craters caused by the explosions. I
' In another section near Nguville j
the Germans announce thalthuy uaytured

also claim good progress to the south
of Arras, through the work of the
sappers and miners.
