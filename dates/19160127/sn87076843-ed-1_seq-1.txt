Meeting of Stockholders for
Organization Friday
JLflJ JL WM
On Saturday evening last, a
meeting was held at the town hall
in Moline which was attended by
a large number of farmers from
"Wood, and Lucas counties, and
from Michigan.
The meeting was called for the
purpose of discussing the raising
of beets, with special reference to
the price of $6.00 per ton.
Mr. "Walter Papenhagen repre
senting the farmers of Michigan,
said the Michigan growers could
not raise 'at a reasonable profit at
a rate less than $6.00 per ton, and
said that it costs more to raise
beets now than it did five years
ago land costs more; cash rent
has increased from $5 to $10 per
acre; taxes are higher; machinery
and labor ami all things pertaining
to the growing of beets have in
creased hi cost, and the harvesting
'comes at a time when farmers are
most' busy, and added to this the
hauling from fields is very injuri
3 ous to the stone roads which cost
the farmers large sums to build
and repair and the heavy trucking
is the hardest kind of work upon
the roads.
It has also been demonstrated
that while a good crop of beets
may net a farmer a little more
profit the first year, the following
crop of oats or corn will not yield
as well if following a beet crop,
and the soil is thus being impover
ished and the farmers decided that
$5 per ton is not sufficient price.
