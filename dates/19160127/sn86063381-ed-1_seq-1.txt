OBJECTIONS MADE TO
ROUTE NORTH OF BEMIDJI
Brainerd Interests Attempt to Get
Road to Pass Through
Their City.
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
St. Paul, Minn., Jan. 27.Protests
and suggestions were numerous to
day when the Minnesota highway
commission held a special meeting
to hear almost 100 Northern and
Northwestern Minnesota business
men tell their views of how the Jef
ferson highway should be run
through Minnesota. The hearings
were held at the state capitol. Sev
eral changes were proposed for the
tentative routing, announced several
days ago.
Center of Objections.
Bemidji seemed the center of ob
jections today. The tentative route
of the highway, which is to extend
from New Orleans to Winnipeg, has
been chosen only as far as Bemidji.
One faction appeared today and told
how it would be possible to put the
route from Bemidji to Blackduck and
Kelliher, thence through Spooner and
Baudette and west to the internation
al boundary. The other route pro
posed is via Bagley, Red Lake Falls
and Warren, thence north to Hallock
and following the Red River country.
The former route is east of Red lake
and the latter west of Red lake.
May Go West,
The latter route is more likely to
be chosen, it was pointed out today,
because of the cost of construction of
a road through that territory is re
garded by the commission to be less.
Permanent roads on the route west
of Red lake are more frequent, the
commission understands.
Brainerd Interests Busy.
Brainerd interests made represen
tations, attempting-to get the-road to
pass through their city, which is
north and east of the proposed route,
tentatively accepted by the commis
sion, running from Little Falls di
rect to Wadena. The Brainerd dele
gation would have the route changed
to include their city, thence back to
Wadena again.
George is Present.
J. L. George, county auditor, head
ed the Bemidji delegation. Other
representatives who addressed the
commission were: J. M. Cathcart,
Crookston E. L. Oberg, Blackduck
L. H. Rice, Park Rapids Fred Lin
coln, Thief River Falls Alvah East
man, J. J. Hillbe and J. W. Beatty,
St. Cloud Commercial club. Repre
sentatives were also here from the
Menahga Booster club, the Warren
Commercial club, the Bagley Auto
mobile club, the Baudette board of
trade, the Wadena Commercial club
and the Red Lake Falls Automobile
club.
Following the conference it was
announced that the things told the
commission members by the men here
today would be taken under consid
eration. A preliminary survey will
be made, the commission members
said, to determine the most econom
ical routes.
DEER HIDES MAY BE
SHIPPED WITH PERMIT
In response to inquiries from the
local game warden, word has been
received from the state game and fish
commission in St. Paul that upon
the receipt of an affidavit, which
states the number of the hunting li
cense and the county from which it
was issued, a permit to ship deer
hides will be issued. The name of
the party to whom it is to be shipped
as well as stating that the skin is
for the hunter's use, must also be in
cluded within the affidavit.

county surveyor's office, left last

cause President Wilson desires

Bemidji," said Congressman

appropriation for Bemidji would
be included. No plans can be
made for Bemidji until money
is appropriated for the struc-
ture."
At a meeting of the Bemidji
