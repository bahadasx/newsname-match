VOL. XIV. TUCUMCARI, QUAY COUNTT, NEW MEXICO, THURSDAY, JAN. 27, 1910 NO. 18
SCARLET FEVER RE
PORTS MAGNIFIED
Thirteen 1b a most unlucky numbor
for Tucumcari. Tho city physician re
ports thnt many cases of scarlet fever
in Tucumcnri nnd it Ih distributed in
different piirts of town. Twelve fam
ilies arc quarantined nnd two dcathn
hnvc occurred during the pnst week.
This is offlciul dope nnd further than
this tho Nowb reporter knowH not.
Just to show how some things nrc
magnified it might bo said thnt one
man, said to bo n business man of this
city, was heard to remark thnt there
were fifty eases of scarlet fever in
town and six died Sunday. This mndo
most of us sit up and tako notice and
aftor investigating it wns found to
he far from correct
Another report wns going the round
that "unlesH better enre was taken
tho present supply of coffins would be
exhausted in a few dnys." Four days
have patised and but two deaths were
reported this week.
If theso reports did not leave Tu
cumcari there would be no use to
contradict them, but people, especially
from other towns, sometimes like to
tell such weird stories about our city
and keep prospective investors from
coming this way.
The schools have been closed, and
all public places of amusement, even
the churches, in order to hurriedly
stamp out this contagion, and the of
ficers are keeping the children at home
therefore n strict quarantine is being
conducted, nnd it is expected thnt tho
quarantine will be raised before long
as the worst seems to have subsided.
MURDERERS OP AKERS ARE
SHOT DIED CURSING GRINGO
Kl Paso, Texas, Jan. "3. Hcrnnrdo
and Frederick Duran, tho Mexican
cattle thieves, condemned to die by
the Carrnnza authorities for tho kill
ing of Bert Akcrs nt Snn Lorenzo, n
fow miles below the international
boundary, Friday, wore executed at
dnylight today in tho cemetery at the
city of Juarez. The body of Akcrs
wns interred here this afternoon. The
bodies of the Mexicans were buried
immediately, but that of Bernardo,
who confessed to having fired tho
shots that killed Akcrs, was exhumed
to satisfy a doubt concerning the
identity of the slayer.
Douglas Downs, another American
who wns with Akcrs seeking stolen
cows, and who escaped tho bullets of
the Mexicans, declared last night af
ter seeing Bernnrdo Duran that tho
prisoner was not the man. Downs
wns at Junrcz cemetery when the face
of tho executed man was exposed this
afternoon nnd then admitted that he
previously had been mistaken. Amer
ican officials were with Downs, nnd
their certification that the slayer had
boon duly executed served tonight to
cnlm n feeling at Vslcta where Akcrs
and Dowjib lived, which authorities
believed might result in trouble.
Three Mexicans previously arrested
in connection with cnttlo stealing ut
Ysletn, were removed to jail in El
Pnso for protection.
The Duran brothers died cursing
Amcicnns. Bernardo appealed for
mercy on behnlf of his brother Fed
erico. "It is unjust to kill two of us for
one Amoricnn," he said. "It is giv
ing two eyes for one tooth. I nm
willing to die, because 1 killed the
gringo but my brother ought to be
allowed to live."
Tho bullets of the firing squadron
killed Federico, but Bernardo was still
conscious nfter ho fell, and the officer
commanding the firing squad gave
him the "mercy shot" through the
hend.
The execution wns attended by 50
Americans, of whom a number were
women.

Chihuahua, Mexico, where he was em

JUDGE MONCUS' ANSWER
Imn, N. M Jan. 17, 1910.
Editor Tho Tucumcari News,
Tucumcari, N. Mex.
Dear Sir:
I notice a copy of nn nrticlc pub
lished by I,n Voz Publlca of Snntn
Hobo, N. M and answered by R. A.
Prentice in your papor.
I wish to stnto thnt this articlo Is
the limit for' any nowspnper to pub
lish. Mr. Prentice 1ms ably answered this
nrticlc, but I wish to make a fow state
ments myself.
A peace complaint against Earl El
liott brought by Segundo Snlas, in it
change of venue from Montoyn. All
witnesses appeared on day set for
trial. On case being called all wit
nesses were sworn nnd examined, with
a competent interpreter, sworn to in
terpret correctly from Spanish into
English and from English into Span
ish. 1
The said Segundo Salas ut first
denied under oath as to over swearing
to tiiis complaint against Earl Elliott
and also denied his signature affixed
to this said complaint. But finally
admitted to his signature but stated
he did not accuse Earl Elliott of tho
things set forth in this complaint. The
malicious prosecution showed to bo
so evident that I dismissed the case
nt tiie cost of the complaining witness.
But did not assess tho defendant's at
torney fees against him.
Ah to the case of Segundo Salas
versus Earl Elliott, assault and bat
tery. It appears that the said Earl
Elliott hail already plead guilty to
this charge and paid his fine, as this
complaint had been filed through er
ror, and the prosecuting witness stnt
cd that the case might as well bo
dismissed, as he thought it would bo
sooner or Inter anyway. So there
was nothing to do but dismiss tho
case.
Now as to tho defendant's attorney
intimidating the prosecuting witness
and ulso the court. A greater false
hood could not bo published.
A man that would publish such
statements as this article contained,
publish them on hearsay, ought not to
be allowed to run a newspaper.
No doubt he obtained the substance
of the articlo from a person posing
as nn attorney, one of theso two-by-four
kind, who, more than probably,
has already been disbarred repeatedly
from ijj-'ctieljg in any court, from
justice court up.
Now as to the race question. This
thing had never entered my mind. I
believe that the Spanish people should
have their rights just the same as
other people, and I will always cn-
leavor to give them their just duos.
I am perfectly satisfied that when
this complaint is brought up beforo
tho district court, wo will see how
mdly the prosecuting witness has
been treated.
I hope in the future, when this
Santa Rosa newspaper wants to print
an article, that tho editor will havo
judgment enough, to use a more rc-
iablc source of information.
Yours very truly,
It. L. MONCUS

Tho bride wus beautifully gowned

ventional black. Tho ring ceremony
was used and the room wns gorgeous

Judge McEiroy, usually one of the

to meet, was somewhat out oi sorts
ust Saturday ull day. It seems that
some person called to see him on Fri
day evening und had a warrant sworn
out for tho arrest of one of his neigh
bors charging him with benting nnd
assaulting a neighbor woman.
Tho Judgo drew the complaint nnd
fnllcd to get service that night, but
everybody in that end of town knuV
about the case, even the mnn upon
whom the warrant wns to havo been
served, but he stood his ground and
welcomed tho officer tho next day.
the man was brought before his
honor, tho Judge, Snturdny morninir.
and he plcud not guilty and said he
was not ready for tho trial and asked
thnt samo be put off until Monday.
After fixing the bond for appearance
tho case wns set for Monday morning
and Judge McEiroy requested that the
plaintiff bring nothing but the wit
nesses to attend tho trial and his
wish wus carried out because of tho
fuct that he has a way of making his

Tho trial resulted in both sides be

DIVERSIFIED CROPS
Agricultural College, N. M Jan. 120
Diversified crops, together with the
hog, cow nnd hen, nre the salvation
of dry fnrmers in New Mexico. This
belief was subscribed to by agricul
tural experts and practical farmers,
gathered together at the Farmers'
Congress held at the Agricultural Col
lege during the first week in January.
It is conceded thnt the value of diver
sified crops, and of tho hog, cow nnd
hen us mortgage lifters und dividend
payers, is gcnorally realized by tho
people of tho dry farming sections of
the state. It is possible, however, that
it is not generally known that the ser
vices of the entire stuff of teachers
and experts of the Agricultural Col
lege and Experiment Station are al
ways at the disposal of the farmers,
who are invited to ask by mail at
nny time for information, instruction
und advice regarding any difficulty in
connection with farm management,
crops, livestock, poultry, or any dis
ease affecting grains, fruit or live
stock. Extensive experiments have
been made on dry farming problems,
with a view to placing tho Agricul
tural College in n position to offer def
inite, helpful advice to those who need
it. It is the nim of Dr. George E.
Ludd, president of tho college, to ren
der service to the pcoplo of tho state
und assurance is given that the Col
lege nnd Experiment Station is ready
und nt any time will gladly co-operate
in every way possible with those who
submit farm troubles by correspond
ence. "PREVENT CLAIMS MEETING"
Tho regular monthly meeting of tho
depot agents of this division wns held
at Dnllmrt last week. Tho meeting
wns termed a "Provont Clnims Moot
ing" and mnny topics ,wcro discussed.
Mr. Dovor attended from this place.
A numbor of tho ngents up that way
had heard about tho change mention
ed in this paper two weeks ago, when
wo said tho division superintendent's
offices would bo moved shortly from
Dnlhnrt and Amnrillo to Tucumcari,
whore thoy would bo concentrated for
economical purposes.
LAND SWINDLERS
AT
WORK IN EAST
Evidently swindlers ure taking ad
vantage of tho emigration from the
east to New Mexico and one of thcli
methods is selling large tracts of land
to unsuspecting parties ut a small
sum of money per ucre.
II. J. Boyies, a well-to-do man, of
Avnrd, Okla., was hero this week to
look at some land he hud bought from
purties in Wichita, Kansas. The con
tract was made with Roach Bros., of
Wichita, for J. A. Koontz, of the same
place.
Mr. Koontz was an old, feeble man,
who claimed to own thousands of ac
res of bind in Quay county, situated
near where Endee nnd Logan are now
locntcd. The Ronch Bros, claimed to
have just closed another deal where
by Mr. Koontz had sold several thous
and acres of this grazing laud to n
gentleman at Winfleld, Kansas, but
still had much more for sale. Mr.
Boylcs took option on fifteen section
and was to pay $1.50 per acre. Ho
had known Roach Bros, and believed
them truthful, but before he would
close the deal he must first see the
land nnd ascertain whether it was as
represented.
He arrived as directed, at hndci!. in
stead rof l.ogun, nnd found Ihe land
located just as was represented, but
whnt bothered him most was" the fn'H
that homesteaders had taken posses
sion of this section of the country,
and he knew there must be n mistake
somewhere, so he boarded a train for
Tucumcari. When ho arrived here he
telegraphed Roach Bros, and .aid he
could not find the plnce nnd nsketl to
be rc-dircctcd. The answer enmc nnd
theso directions were the snme as be
fore. Ho then called on some of the
local rcnl estate men and inquired of
Mr. Donohoo nt tho land olficc. It
did not take long to convince him that
he would not find this Innd.
A few months ago another buyer
was sent here on the same errand.
Whnt Roach Bros, and Koontz are
making out of this deal is not known,
but they arc not working for their
health, because such business ns this
is not usually very healthful, especial
ly when they nre found out. Mi.
Boyies promises to got n little ex
pense money out of tho donl, nnd per-
hnps by the time he gets homo he will
decide to turn the rascals in to the
proper authorities.
Whenever u man expects to get
something for nothing there is a nig
ger in the woodpile somewhere nnd
some fellow is bound to get "stung."
New Mexico hns good Innd cheap but
the day of buying largo acreages is
about past, and especiully ut $1.50 an
ncre.
WIFE WILL NOT EAT UNLESS
CITY FEEDS HUSBAND
A new comer to Tucumcnri has be
come intimntcly acquainted with the
officials by his persistent begging for
food. He hns a wife and children and
says ho formerly lived in Oklahoma.
He found a half dug-nut north of the
track and moved his family there for
the winter It is thought.
Tho mnn is in very good health con
sidering, but is looking for a job, not
work, but just a common job, with
wages attached to it. The other day
a man approached this newcomer nnd
wanted him to work for him. Ihe day
was Friday and of course that being
an unlucky day ho could not consent
to a thing like that, but the worst of
it all is that this family has no money
with which to buy grub, so nn ofllcdr
is detailed to go over and bring the
kids to town nnd feed them at a res
taurant. The wife refuses to come un
less her husband is invited. Tho hus
band refuses to let the officers tako
his wife food unless ho is to share it
with her.
Some of the councilmen hnvc receiv
ed threats of serious consequence un
less the city furnishes him food, nnd
he hns sent the marshal word that he
has been bother enough and unless
they cense to visit his new acquired
home they will have a moro serious
charge than vagrancy to place to his
credit. He has never told how mnny
cemeteries he has inaugurated back in
Oklahoma but this paper is promised
something sensational if he. is not giv
en his daily bread.
LOOK FOR SMALL POX HOBO
A report was turned in Monday that
a hobo wns going from house to house
asking for something to ent, that his
faco was broken out with some dis
ease very much like the smnll-pox.
Tho officers armed themseles with
disinfectants nnd proceeded to look
for Mr. Hobo, but no truce of him wns
found.
If n ghost were to como to Tucum
cnri just now, thoro is no telling what
would happen to soma superstitious
folks, but let us hope nothing more
serious happens, It hurts our bust
ness men financially, to start falso re
ports, and Tucumcnri citizens cannot
ufTord to drlvo her customers to other
towns to trade unless it is unsafe for
them to ocmo here. Think twice bo
foro you speak, nnd you will never
be far wrong,
THE FALL RESOLUTION
The State Department, it is said, is
busily engaged in muking its compli
ance with the Fall resolution, which
the Senate pnsscd the other day. Tho
an Aver, it is said, will be full, meaning
thereby thnt every vestige of curi
osity expressed in thnt resolution will
bo satisfied. Moru than thnt might,
with entire propriety, bo done. The
answer might be made not only full,
but overflowing. For tho Fall reso
lution, among other things, culls for
a record of outrages committed in
Mexico against Americans since tho
overthrow of Mndcro, wherens tho
outrages began at a much earlier date.
Just why the republicans nro loss
eager for tho publication of tho data
of these earlier outrages has not been
explained, but one will be at no loss
for the lenson when one rccnlls thnt
those of earlier date wero committed
during tho administration of Mr. Tnft.
The motive in bringing this fact to
the recollection of the nverngo man is
to suggest u considcrntion of tho sin
cerity of those Senntors who aro now
clamoring for wur and intervention.
For the policy of President Tnft was
precisely tho policy of President Wil
son. That is, Mr. Tnft refused to send
a half million Americans into Mexico,
iust as Mr. Wilson Is refusing. In
stead, Mr. Tuft officially and urgently
advised Americans in Mexico to leave
the country, nnd provided means for
doing so. just, again, ns Mr. Wilson is
doing. It will bo seen, thcrcforo, thnt
the policy of thj Democratic President
s not merely analogous to that of his
Republican predecessor, but in the
uibstnncinl sense, identical with It.
The policy of Mr. Wilson,, in other
words, is but n continuation of that
of Mr. Tnft, with no moro variation
than is needed to meet a situntlon so
fluid. Mr. Tnft wa3 tho original
watchful waiter; Mr. Wilson's contri
bution was only tho phrnse by which
it hns come to be identified.
However, this recalls but ono of the
paragraphs in that chapter of history.
Then, ns now, there were thoso in
the .Senate who demanded intervention
in the name of patriotism, and there
wero those who denounced tho de
mand in the snme tnlismnnic nnme.
It wns Senator Stone of Missouri who
led the cry for intervention. It was
Senator Lodge of Massachusetts who
led tho denunciation of that cry. The
uhcqucnt careers of their senti
ments nre made the more curious by
ih circumstance thnt their conversion
to the contrary view Was coeval
enough to be called simultaneous. In
other words, it wns very shortly nfter
the responsibilities of the Mexican
situation devolved on a Democratic
President thnt tho Democratic Sena
tor from Missouri underwent a Pnu
lia conversion, and virtually at that
instant the Republican Senator under
went what may be culled tho Saulian
conversion. Ho who hud roared as n
lion learned with marvelous sudden
ness to coo as r. dove, while he who
had cooed learned to roar even more
loudly.
NEW BUSINESS BLOCK
P. II. Sidney reports the sale of two
business lots to parties In Knnsas.
These lots ure located on the corner
of 1st nnd Main streets, formerly own

These parties will soon let n con-

Ho lived in Illinois nnd desired tc

than 100 miles this side of Chicago.
The rnte to Tucumcari was more than

GLENRIO SHIPPING MAIZE
AND CORN BY THE CAR LOAD
Glcnrio, N. M., Jan. 19. Murray &
Brown have shipped another enr of
maize nnd ono of corn from Glcnrio.
While hundreds of tons of muizo leave
hero each season, this car of corn was
tho first to go from this district. In
pnst years the farmers confined them
selves to mnlze, knfir corn, etc., but
the past season Indian .corn took a
prominent lend and tho results have
been so gratifying the farmers uro
ikcly to double their acreage this
year. Many fields run 30 to 35 bush
els per acre, and considering it is
homestead land, the tiller of tho soil
is far bettor conditioned thnn people
living on rented plnccs in tho cast,
where tho yield is no greater. Murray
& Brown expect to load out several
moro cars of corn.
J. D. Phlpps, who lives on n farm
0 miles from town has made a splen
did record feeding hogs on maize. He
fed 5 tons of muizo and 20 bushels of
corn to finish three hogs. Figuring
tho local grain market at $10 per
ton for maizo and CO cents per bushel
for corn, his grnin, sold ns feed, would
havo brought him 00. Ho fed the
three porkers and renlizcd $130.
DON'T BE A CURB STONER
Don't let yourself be classed with
the men who set around and wait
until tho efforts nnd advertising of
other active dealers has brought somo
prospective people into your town und
then hang around the incoming trains
and hotels nnd npprouch these people
with the assertion "If you nro looking
for good farms I have them and will
sell them chenper thnn nny mnn in
town." lou might as well slip uround
nnd stcnl tho man's money or breaic
into his smoke house and get bacon.
This is no way to do a rcnl estate
business. It is unfair and dishonest.
You will not only fail to mnko a deal
but will in most cases bo tho means
of keeping tho other fellow from mak
ing the sale. Be a man of honor and
go after your business in n business
liko way. Secure your own prospects
by advertising your propositions and
