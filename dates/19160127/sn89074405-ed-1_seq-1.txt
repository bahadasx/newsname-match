Washington Report Says
Wisconsin May Compete
in Several States.
DAKOTA SITUATION
BEING CONSIDERED
Gets Attention at Confer
ence in Washington—All
Interests There.
(Herald Special Service.)
Washington, Jan. 27.—Progressive
republicans of the senate, together
with a number of their colleagues In
the house, discussed their political
plans at a private dinner. The lead
ers, who are insisting that progressive
principles must prevail in the next
republican convention if there is to
be any hope of political success, are
Senators Borah of Idaho Cummins
and Kenyon of Iowa, La Follette of
Wisconsin, Clapp of Minnesota, Gron
na of North Dakota, Sterling of South
Dakota, Norrls of Nebraska, Poin
dexter and Jones of Washington and
Works of California.
Every one of these senators stated,
in response to the direct question that
the .purpose of their conferences was
not to revive t.he old progressive party
that Bplit off from the regular or
ganisation four years ago, but to
bring about such a condition that a
united front could be presented to the
common enemy in the coming cam
paign. While the senators are not
disposed to talk now for publication,
they said it is thelc purpose to hold
conferences with the leaders of the
so-called regular organization and
the so-called conservatives, and en
deavor to arrange in advance of the
Chicago convention a declaration of
principles that, could be supported by
all republicans.
Platform the Important Thing:.
"This," said one of the most influ
ential of the progressive group, "Is
of more Importance to the cause of
republioanism right now thnji the
candidacy of any particular man. The
right man can be found if the plat
form is all right, arid the chances are
that the republican party, will profit
from its experiences of the past four
years, and go into the coming fight
with a determination and the power
to succeed.
"So far as the progressive republl
cans ,pf the northwest and. the middle
west''are concerned, -.formei*-. .Senator
Hoot cannot be taken into consldera*
tion. Under no circumstances could
he be accepted, as in any way. progres
sive. Justice Hughes might be con
sidered if there were reasons to be
lieve he would be a candidate. Out
side of the progressive candidates—by
which I mean Borah, Cummins or La
Follette—there are two men whose
candidacy might be favorably consid
ered They are Burton of Ohio, and
Weeks of Massachusetts. The latter
by reason of business affiliations is
injured at the outset, but has many
friends in the west.
See Good Points in Burton.
"Senator Burton, however, more
nearly than any other candidate will
be the second choice of many of the
progressive states. Although referred
to generally as a conservative he has
strong progressive tendencies and
would make an excellent compromise
candidate, acceptable both in the east
and the. west. This subject of candi
dates has not yet been taken up, but
the former senator from Ohio will fig
ure to a large extent in the progres
sive communities."
It had been understood that the
progressive candidates agreed at their
last conference and dinner not to
have two progressives running against
each other in any state. Senator La
Follette, who was not at the first din
ner in person, was reported to be
favorable to that plan. Yesterday it
was understood that Mr. La Follette
told some of his colleagues included
in the list named that no one had
authority to make any bargain of any
kind on his behalf. Unless La Fol
lette becomes a party to this plan, In
several of the northwestern states the
primary race promises to be a free
for all with a splitting up of the pro
gressive-republican vote.

GREAT BATTLE
NOW PRfMCIfl)
Chicago, Jan. 27.—Four robbers, armed with revolvers,
entered the Washington Park National bank in East 63rd
street, threatened the lives of the cashier, clerks and 20
depositors, and escaped with between $15,000 and $20,000
dollars.^ The twenty depositors were forced to stand in
line facing the wall, while the robbers looted the money in
the teller's cage.
After grabbing the cash, the robbers backed to the
door covering the bank clerks and depositors and escaped
in an automobile.
A. W. McCauley, assistant cashier, jumped into an
automobile and attempted to follow the robbers, but they
quickly outdistanced him.

Big Fight in North Sea Ex
pected—Air Raid on Lon
don First.
New York. Jan. 27.—The German
fleet, with the heaviest new battle
ships armed with 17-inch guns, far
outranging the largest of the British
vessels and escorted by a fleet of
Fokker aeroplanes and Zeppelins,
armed with a new pneumatic gun
capable of firing armor piercing pro
jectiles, will soon appear tn the
North sea to give battle to the Brit
ish, according to Thomas R. Mac
Meehan, aeronautic engineer and
president of the Aeronautic Society
of America.
Mr. MacMeehan said the basis of
his prediction is from sources ot au
thoritative information in Germany.
Predicts Air Raid.
The time. of the German navy's
dash from the Kiel canal will be
fixed, mainly by the results of the
testing of the new engine of destruc
tion from the air—the pneumatic gun
or torpedo tube, Mr. MacMeehan as
serted. The weapon will be tried
out, the engineer asserted, within two
or three weeks in a monster raid by
Zeppelins on London.
"For the past four yean the Krupp
company experts have been working
on the aerial torpedo, which, accord
ing to my information, is now per
fected," said Mr. MacMeehan. "Briefly
the torpedo tube or pneumatic sun
launching the projectilp is about
eight feet long. Air pressure Is used
because of the danger of using pow
der for a gun of that caliber on an
airship. The projectile is shot from
the mouth of the gun with a velo
city of 650 feet per second.
"This great velocity overcome* all
the cross currents of wind in the air
and the motion of the airship,, w.hlch
made the bomb so useless a missile.
It goes straight to its mark with an
ever-increasing rate of speed, and
strikes within a few seconds, even
from so great a height as 16,000 feet.
"The projectile, weighing four and
a half pounds, has a point so hard
and sharp as a cold chisel and lands
with a striking inpact of fourteen
tons. It will pierce armor plate and
then explode inside."

Washington, Jan. 27.—Woodrow
Wilson is having a terrible time with
the American snobocracy. Each day
he has to issue a new order to the ef
fect that on the coming tour of the
middle west he does not propose to
attend any private meetings, nor sit
in at any partisan entertainment nor
yet speak to an audience of people
who paid for their tickets of admis
sion. And each day comes a new rea
son for the repetition of the order.
Pittsburgh Plans Small Affair.
The Pittsburgh chamber of com
merce started to use the president as
the star attraction for the organisa
tion's annual dinner. So much per
plate, of course. This led to the presi
dent's announcement that he would
not speak to people who had paid for
their seats. Also he changed the Pitta
burgh date so that he would speak
there in the middle of the day, thus
making it certain that he would miss
the dinner. Pittsburgh thereupon!
calmly rented a hall with a seating
capacity for 2,600 people and inform
ed the president that his request for a
Se
kiih'"
ubtle meeting with free seats would
granted. Pittsburgh has a hall
which will seat 10,000.'

TO BIG UNION
Meets Women in New York
This Morning—He Kept
Them Waiting.
New York, Jan. 27.—President Wil
son today refused to support the
movement for amendment to the fed
eral constitution providing for wom
an suffrage. He spoke briefly to 200
members of the Congressional Union
for Woman Suffrage and told them
he felt the suffrage question should
be dealt with by each individual state.
PretoldQjit Wilson received the suf
fragettes after they had waited for
him for more than an hour in the
Waldorf-Astoria hotel, which he made
his headquarters on his arrival here
this morning, from Washington, pre
pared to make three addresses during
the day.
Exam Fails.
Efforts made by Mrs. Mary Beard,
wife of a. Columbia university profes
sor. to cross-examine the president
on his position, met with failure. Mr.
Wilson refused courteously to reply
to her queries.
President "Wilson told, the women
that "it may be my mind ,works slow
ly, but I have always thought that
there were things which should be
built slowly, and therefore made more
lasting. I may be a. little old fash
ioned in my view I hat, the suffrage
question should be handled by the
state."
fRENCH LOSSES
AM80,000
Claimed that Number Have
Been Killed During the
War to Date.
Bristol, Eng., Jan. 27.—M. Longiuet,
French socialist deputy, who address
ed the labor conference here, on being
questioned regarding French losses in
the war, said that 800,000 French sol
diers had been killed, that 1,400,000
had been wounded and that 300,000
had been taken prisoners.
that if the. Central armory was taken
the president might no be able to flll
its 12,000 seats. So the chamber of
commerce stuck to the smaller house
and arranged to give out 3,200 tickets
to its 8,200 members. Invitations were
sent also to the heads of all the civic
organisations of Cleveland, and these
were to be seated on the stage and in
the aisles. After that standing room
was to be open to anybody who could
get past the ticket-takers at the doors.
Gives Snap Away.
It was realised that this was a vio
lation of the president's stipulation,
but an agreement was made between
the chamber and the newspapers to
keep the deal quiet so that no news
of it could reach the White House be
fore the cunning little stunt was pull
ed off. All went wall until about
midnight when somebody got hold of
the country edition of one of the
Cleveland papers in which the whole
charming snap was given away. By 1
a. m. today the long-distance wires
between Cleveland and Washington
were groaning with an overload of
business, due to the attempts of Cleve
land people to sew up all who might
carry the news to Garcia—that is, to
Woodrow.

President Wilson frankly admitted

thought should take precedence over
everything else.
President Wilson promised again
that he would discuss the subject with
