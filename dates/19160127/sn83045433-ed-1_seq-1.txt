audience in a mirthful spirit with htr
running fire of Jestful comments.
'?"We *ave kepf our courae by reason

centripetal. And there axe two forces

"I feel the question of taxation ahould
be settled during this Congress. I am of
the opinion It is more Important that this

The board, arter a spirited discussion,
adopted a resolution asking voting power
of Congress to settle the matter ot prohibi
tion for the District. The resolution was
presented by C. J. Gockeler, former sec

STORY OF WOE
TOLD BY MRS.

Degrading and Distressing Ac

Is Given Jury.
-
WHISPERS HER STORY?
Attorney Declares Defense
Will* Not Be Based on
Unwritten Law.
ADMITS WIFE WAS JEALOUS
Counsel Declares Mrs. Mohr Loved
Husband with an "Undying
Fondness."
By SOPHIE TREADWELL.
Providence, Jan. 26.?Mrs. Elisabeth F.
Mohr, on trial for murder, took th?
stand In her own defense this afternoon.
She walked to the witness chair with
quick steps and turned to face with
calmness the rows of staring eyes. The
crowded court room spread ln eager Unes
before her. The crowd was absolutely
?till. There seemed to be neither breath
nor movment in any of the cloeely pack
ed human beings.
She stood a moment, one small black
gloved hand raised tn the ancient pose
of the truth-teller, her whole body rigid
held in a vise of stares. Then she re
laxed Into the chair and turnel a long
quiet look on the Jury.
Immediately there was a breaking up
of the tense stillness, a murmuring of
tongues, a craning of necks, a rustling of
papers, the quick sliding of pencils, and
the waving of hands to messenger boys.
For Mrs. Mohr was on the stand?the
woman accused of plotting her husband's
death with his hostlers and chauffeur,
hiring them to stop his automobile In a
lonely road and shoot blm.
Dr. C Franklin Mohr was ambushed
and killed the night of August ?fl last
while riding with Miss Emily Burger.
hia housekeeper. T^-day his widow start
ed to t*il the story that Is depended ??
to clear her of the charge of complicity
In his murder.
Mrm. Mnhr i.M* Story.
Mre. Mohr told her story quietly with
out hesitations, but In a voice ao weak
that even the Judge, who sat beside her,
ooukl not bear distinctly. Again and
again she had to be admonished to speak
more clearly for her own sake, that the
Jury might be able to understand her.
The story she told was most degrading
and distressing; degrading to her, de
grading to the dead man, distressing to
all who had to listen. But lt Is the story
her attorneys count upon most to free
her. for It Is the world old story of the
wronged wife.
Before Mra. Mohr took the stand, Ar
thur Cushlng. her attorney, made the
opening address for her defense. He
said:
' ???? in? Fond nenn.
"We want you to understand we are
not going to assume that this is an un
written law case. Such a defense has
no place ln New England- We leave that
to places further south and west. Even
If Dr. Mohr was a very faithless and
cruel husband, a worthies? citizen, I be
lieve he had a perfect right to live. We |
are making no effort to contradict this."
Mr. Cushing th?n went on to analyze
the motives the State had given for Mrs.
Mohr's part in the murder. He pro
pounded the theory that Mrs. Mohr could
not have been both Jealous and covetous
at the same time, for "Jealousy has for
Its foundation sexual love, and Is not a
cold, calculating emotion, while covet
ousness of property Is cold and love
less.'*
"We will say in all frankness." went
on the lawyer, "that Mrs. Mohr was
certainly Jealous of her husband. She ?
loved him ln spite of abuse and*of hts I
unfaithfulness; she loved him. She 1
always wanted in the midst nf her?
litigation against him to become ree
onclled." ?**

Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson
to be a candidate for the toga now

Secretary Wilson is regarded as
about as strong a candidate as the
Democrats can find to oppose former
Senator Philander C. Knox. who will
be the Republican candidate to suc

heavily on Its labor reoord. and it is

000 lt adopted a resolution pledging the
conference to assist the government so
far ag possible In the successful prosecu

The conference had Deviously adopted
by a vote of 1.M7.000 to 206,000 a resolu
tion entirely approving the action of the
parllmentary labor party in co-operating
with other political parties In the na
tional recruiting campaign.
The early proceedings were marked by
?? attack on the compulsory service bill
by the president, William C. Anderson,
member of Parliament for the Atter
cllffe division of Sheffield. Mr. Andrson.
who opposed the bill in Parliament, de
elared that it did not redeem the pledge
of Premier Asquith regarding compul
sion.
"No form of words can offer immunity
from danger." he added. "We cannot
have forced military service without the
risk of forced industrial service. Any
attempt to use this weapon to coerce
trades unionists will lead to great bit
terness and end ln fault."
James Sexton, of the National Dock
Workers, Introduced the resolution pledg
ing the conference to aaslst the govern
ment as far as possible to prosecute the
war successfully. It expressed the hor
ror of the conference at the atrocities
committed by (?ermany and her allies.

GUNS ON SHIP
ALTER STATUS
Lansing May Rule Mounted
Cannon Make Them Aux
iliaries of War.
Authoritative Information ohtalned
last night to the effect that Germany
does not consider herself bound by her
correspondence with the United States,
relative to submarine warfare, to re
frain from attacking armed merchant
vessels without warning, is understood
to have an Important bearing on the In
tention of the State Department shortly
to revise Its ruling with reapert to the
status of armed merchantmen.
That such a change of ruling Is
Imminent Is borne out of the fact learned
last night that certain foreign diplomate
have gotten the impression that this will
be done in the near future.
According to statements made in re
liable quarters, had It been shown that
a German submarine sank the Persia,
Germany would have rpgarded the attack
as Justifiable In the light of the evidence
that the Persia mounted a 4.7 inch gun.
Both Germany and Austria It was stated,
are disposed to contend that the arming
of an enemy morchant ship makes tt
virtually an auxiliary ship of war. The
State Department, It Is now said, is
about prepared to take a similar view.
I'ntil a definite case arises ln whicn
?neh a merchant ship is attacked, a
change of ruling would be Inopportune.
Consequently, the department will
follow the practice of permitting clear
ance papers to be Issued on assurance
that the ?uns on board will not be used
unless the ship is attacked without warn

BERLIN ADVISED
TO GIVE IN TO
DEMANDSOFU.S.
Von Bernstorff Urges Ger
many to Accept American
Views on Lusitania.
FOLLOWS CONFERENCE
Teuton Envoy Satisfied Him
self with Sine Qua Non of
This Government.
WILL USE HIS PERSUASION
Expected Germany Will at Last Admit
Illegality of Sub Attack in
Giant Liner.
Count von Bernstorff, the Gfrman Am
bassador, last night advised hts govern
ment to accept the views of the I'nited
States regarding what la easentlal to a
satisfactory settlement of the Lusitania ?
controversy.
The message to his government was
sent by the Ambassador following a ?V
mlnute conference which he had yester
day with Secretary of State I-ansing.
Along with the recommendation went a
written memorandum, which. Secretary
Lansing informed the Ambassador, repre
sented the sine qua non of the American
position.
The memorandum was drawn up ?t the
conference. It was authoritatively stated
last night that it not only represented
what the Secretary declared to be neces
sary to a aettlcment. but was acceptable
to the Ambassador himself. Therefore, It
Is stated, the Ambassador was able to
?insure Mr. I^ansln-z that he would use
his best endeavors to persuade the Berlin
foreign office to approve it.
Should this be the caie, it was learned.
the reply from Berlin Is likely to be ln
the form of a formal note to the Ameri
can government embodying all the con
cessions demanded. And In that event,,
it Is said, the note would Include:
? Uor?ft?.t, of ill aaw IU ?
Renewed expressions of regret by Ger
many over the loss of the American
lives;
Reference to the assurances given by
Germany In the case of the Arabic and
subsequently that she would not again!
attack unarmed, unresisting merchant?
veas sis without warning and without giv
ing the passengers and crews opportunity
for escape.
An offer to make full and reasonable
reparation in money for the American
lives that? were lost by reason of an Ille
gal act on the part of the German tub
marine.
The last paragraph referred to. if
adopted in substance by Germany, will
constitute a concession on the chief point
of diff?rence which has been responsible
for the delay. Although willing to pay
an Indemnity, Germany, as represented
In the memorandum which Count von
Bernstorff presented to Secretary Lan
sing, and which was rejected by the lat
ter as unsatisfactory, preferred to pay lt
rather on the score of friendship than
because of admitted liability.
In the communication aent to Berlin
last night Ambassador Bernstorff is un
derstood to have advised his government
that the United States cannot accept a
settlement on any basis other than an
admission that the attack on the Lusi
tania was legally unjustifiable in so far
as it invaded the rights of the neutrals
on board.
On leaving the -Secretary's office the
Ambassador stopped long enough in the
office of Mr. Lansing's private secretary
to dictate a brief communication. It is
understood that this communication was
a wireless code message to Berlin advis
ing the Germa*, government briefly of
the outcome of the conference, and stat
ing that a more detailed report would
follow by cable.
