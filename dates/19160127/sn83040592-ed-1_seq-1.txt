custom themselves to modern business methods. There
is no better way for them to familiarize themselves' with
the methods of the business world than by keepinr a
bank account Every legitimate phase of commercialism
will be touched upon through intercourse with the bank,
and its customers are brought face to face with various
actual business propositions which will prove invaluable
to the conducting of their own affairs. Your children
will learn the value of a dollar much quicker if it is de

they earn.
