8TORY HOUR
Mrs. McDearman told stories Fri
day afternoon to the children of the
primary grades. Mrs. McDearman
is a very attractive story teller and
her stories were enjoyed by all hear
ing them. She told two lovely sto
ries from Mary Stuart "How the
Shepherd Told Them" and "Princess
Meadowlark." .'
Dr. Walter McLain was in charge
of story hour for the intermediate
grades, telling in his interesting way
the first of a series of nature sto
ries to be taken up by the League.
.' For the remainder of the year the
League will endeavour to stress Na
ture Stories, realizing as it does, that
no more marvelous story book has
ever been written 'than the 'Story
Book of God,' filled with beauties
more fantastic than the "Blue Bird,"
and wonders more magical than
'Aladdins Lamp.'
Once upon , a time a great child
lover wrote to a great nature lover
these lines:
And Nature, the old nurse, took
The child upon her knee,
Saying: "Here in a story book
Thy Father hag written for thee.'
"Come wander with me," she said,
"Into regions yet untrod,
And read what .13 still unread
In the manuscripts of God."
And he wandered away and away
With Nature, the dear old nurse,
Who sang to him night and day, .
: The. rhymes of the Universe. V
And whenever the way seemed long,
Or hi3 heart within him failed, .
She would sing a more wonderful
song, ,
Or tell a more marvelous tale."
Longfellow to Agassiz.

TO THE TEACHERS OF
; PUTNAM COUNTY
I would respectfully call your at
tention to the short course in Agri
culture to be given at the Central
High School in Cookeville Feb., 7-12,
and urge that every rural teacher
who can possibly do so, make ar
rangements to attend. I urge this
for your benefit as well "as that of
the pupils whom you may teach.
Why? . Let me tell you something.
The state Is going to require you to
teach elementary agriculture in your
schools in a very short while, ana
it may be next fall. You want to be
successful in your wont, and the
State will expect you to be. Nearly
all of you are now wholly unprepar
ed to teach thia subject. You can
get a fund of practical inrormauon
by attending these meetings, and it
will cost you nothing but your time.
.There are many fads in education,
nut (the teaching of agriculture Is
no fad. and it has come to stay as!your letters. "
