CONCERT A SUCCESS.
On Wednesday night, at 8:00
o'clock a large crowd gathered at
the Academy for the purpose of
listening to the selections to be
rendered by the students of the
Academy, under the direction of
Alfred Anderson.
There were fifty of them tak
ing part and all of them showed
marked ability, and thorough
training.
The first number on the pro
gram from 'Carmen' was render
ed in a pleasing, masterful way.
The second number, a poem,
written by Longfellow upon the
death of his wife, "Good Night,
Good Night, Beloved, was sung
with much feeling and would have
melted any heart.
The Goslings, sung by the choir
was snappy and met with great
applause.
Twilight, rendered by Albert
F. Anderson was great and he
had to respond to an encore.

success.
All the remaining numbers
were good, just as good as you
would hear them anywhere.

would let them take their seats
they had to sing it again.
