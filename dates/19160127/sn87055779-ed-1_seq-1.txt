PROYIDFNCF. R. I.. 1 ee. 27.
The piece de resistance of the Möhr
murder trial, Mrs. Klizahcth Fran
ce Mohr's story, was all told when
court took th mid-day recess. The
woman's recital, wholly lacking in
dramatic elements was a complete
and categorical denial of everything
charged against her in the indict
ment ami in the testimony of the I7
prosecution witnesses.
She declared solemnly that she did
nrt hire Victor Rrown. (leorge
Healis and Henry Spellman, negro
servants, to assassinate Hr. Charles
F. Möhr and disfigure Miss Kmily C
Rurger.

"I loved Ir. Möhr too well." was
her explanation. Mrs. Möhr told her
narrative without once breaking
down.,
The cross-examination was to
come this afternoon.
"I have led up to the summer of
1015, the period of the murder,"
was Arthur Cushing's opening re
mark today "Now, I want to go
into the tragedy itself, but first I
will go hack a hit"
Mr. dishing then had Mrs. Möhr
tell of her hushand spending Christ
mas wdth her in 1913 and of his leav
ing her the following February and
sending her $100 per month for the
maintenance of the children there
after. After telling of the litiga

wa.' pending when the doctor was

up to the murder.

"The Saturday a week ho fore the
shooting. I think It was Aug. 21."
said Mrs. Möhr, "1 was going to
Newport. I had been invited by
friends. I sent Charles to tell his
father that he could take Charles
to Newport and I would take Yir
ßina. "Dr. Möhr had Miss Rurger with
him on the trip and when Charles
told me about it. I made up my
mind the child never again should
go with his father and that woman."
Cushing then by a few unimport
ant questions, led Mrs. Möhr over
her return to Newport in the week
before the killing.
"You have heard the story of
fleorge Healis that he and Rrown
saw you at your home on the night
of Friday, Aug. 27, four days before
the murder. Was that true?" Cush
ing demanded.
"Ahsolutely not," Mrs. Möhr said.
"I never at any time saw Rrown
and Healis together, at my home or
any place else."
In answer to the questions put to
hrr bv her counsel, Mr. Cushing.
the witness said that her husband
had been cruel to her and ahusivo,
but that she loved him notwith
standing his treatment. She iden

throne closing the historic session
concluded with these words:
"We shall not lay down our arms
until we have vindicated the cause
which carries with it the future of

RRISTOU England, Jan. 27. By
an overwhelming majority of 1.577.
X00. the Trades Union conference, in
session here today, adopted resolu
tions opposing compulsory military
service in Great Britain.
The vote on the resolutions was
as follows:
Against conscription, 1,796,000.
For conscription, 219,000.
The announcement of the result
of the ballot was greeted with
cheers which lasted for five minutes.
Though the conference yesterday
adopted resolutions pledging its
support to the government in prose
cuting the war to a final conclusion
in action In condemning compulsory
military service was a foregone con
clusion from the time the meetings
began here.
Show Opposition.
The delegates, representing all
branches of English labor, were de
termined to show their opposition to
conscription even in the modified
form proposed by Premier Asquith
and his cahinet colleagues. Several
speakers opposed the resolutions
and urged the delegates representing
more than 2,000.000 workers to sup
port the government, or, at least, re
frain from active opposition.
William C. Anderson, president of
the conference and member of par
liament from the Attercliffe divis
ion of Sheffield, led the fight for the
resolutions. He declared proposals
for compromise were "worse than
useless" and that the interests of
labor demanded firm opposition to
"any movement savoring of militar
ism." Delegates who had been unable
to get here for the Wednesday ses
sion arrived today. Most of the late
arrivals were opponents of conscrip
tion. Delegates representing several
thousand workers refrained from
voting today.
The ballot on the anti-conscription
resolutions brought out 2,015,000
votes. In two ballots on different
resolutions yesterday there were
cast, respectively. 2,053,000 and
2,101,000 votes.

LONDON. Jan. 27. Rritish lead
ers who have opposed the estahlish
ment of a blockade because of the
effect it would have on neutral na
tions, expressed hich approval today
of the action of the government in
staving off any action that might
have further alienated the sympathy
of non-belligerents. They declared
that the question of a blockade was,
for the time-being at least, relegated
to the background.
The criticism that has recently
been levelled at the foreign secre
tary. Sir Edward Grey, was notice
ably lessened today as a result of
the masterly way in which he handl
ed the tlockade issue for the gov
ernment. Parliamentary advocates of a
blockade that would "strangle Ger

defeated their desires and that after

such a commerce-destroying cordon
it would tie impossible to bring up
the matter again in the near future
