LOOMING up like Mount Rainier on a clear dav is the fact that the Chamber of Commerce has
steadfastly held aloof, and refused to join in the efforts to remove the discriminatory tourist rates
maintained by the allies of the ()-\V. railroad against Seattle's commercial interests.
In the face of this fact, Secretary Yandell of the chamber today heaped insult to the injury of Seattle
business men when he sought, in a letter to Gov. Litter, to discredit the work in this respect of Chairman
C. A. Reynolds of the public service commission.
WhHe blowing hot one moment by declaring the chamber has been trying to "adjust" these rates for

Or. as J. C. l.*crone one of the
company engineer*, put It: "If I'd
have known where It was I would
have located It."
And so the telephone companv. In
the state hearing here, asked the
public service commission to allow
Iheae mysterious missing million
dollar belonging* to be Included In
the appraiaa! and e*tlmated cost of
reproducUon of the company's prop

And on the estimated
valuation of property are
to be based the rates which

"omission* "
That'e what the company told the
public serrlce commission thla
morning. The sparks got. away
from the company'* engineer* when
they were making their $200,000 In

Call It "Omisaions"
The runaway wa* discovered

The company's estimate of It*
