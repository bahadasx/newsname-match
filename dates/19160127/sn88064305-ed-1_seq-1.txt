d few scattered precincts in North
Louisiana, Col. R. G. Pleasant

ed In New Orleans Col. Pleasant
of received a majority of nearly
5e 25.000 out of a total of 30,000

C. P. Quinius, in charge of nesw

1y ceiving reports from his sup- Co

a charging irregularities and de- S

tested. His statement follows: poll
for "We have positive informa- 9,5:
be- tion that nearly every, [f not ing
every provision of the primary cot
law was violated in the city to
day, and, furthermore; the city of
returns indicate on their face i
that they are fraudulent. We for
Sexpect to contest the election, n
and ask the Barret men in pre- se(
cincts where an insignificant of
Barrett vote was returned to Ba
send us their names in order to .
facilitate us in our probe, and to H
give us any other data showing s
violatins of the law and fraud Gi

ret's country majority will more o0
than offset Pleasant's legitimate

polled about 22,140 votes, against
9,538 for Claiborne, who is show-i
t ing considerable strength in the
