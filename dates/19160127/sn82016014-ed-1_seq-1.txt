The forecast calls for generally fair

Topeka is due for low gas pressure

company by L. G. Treleaven, receiver
of the local distributing company,
reads as follows:
"Break in the Oklahoma line. Pres
sure will be short today and probably
until the present cold weather is over."
The break in the Oklahoma line,
however does not mean that the gas
supply will be totally shut off, accord
ing to officials of the company. How
ever, the pressure will be lower than
usual which, figuratively speaking, is
going some.
A bypass has been constructed
around the break, according to re

of the entire supply's being cut off. .

the cashier, Frank Zerma, and the
robber was caught after a two-hour
chase by a posse of 35 armed citizens.
The bandit, who engineered the job

Kan., for 25 years. He was frighten

At 1 0 o'clock a lone man, masked
and armed with a revolver, entered the
bank and ordered E. M. Seaton, assist
ant cashier, to hold up his hands.
Seaton complied, but Zerma, who was
in the back room, fooled the robber
Into believing he was armed. The man
ran out of the bank and fled in a
northwesterly direction, traveling on
foot. A posse was quickly formed and
immediately started fn pursuit of the
bandit.
When arrested Randall told mem
