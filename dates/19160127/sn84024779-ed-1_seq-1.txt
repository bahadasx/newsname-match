ARRIYED FRIDAY
From Chaffee Where He Has Had
Charge of a Yard at
That Plaoe
MEW PRICES ARE IN EFFECT
At the Thompson Yarde I no., Yard
In Thia Oity and Large Shed
Will Be Built
A. C. McQuoid of Chatfe, N. D.',
is the local manager of the
Thompson Yards Inc., yard at this
place, formerly known as the
White & McCulloch Lumber Yard.
He is now getting acquainted with
the people of this vicinity, and
says that as far as he has became
acquainted with Wahpeton, he
likes our city very much, and that
he thinks that the company whom
he represents will do a good busi
ness here. Asked whether they
would continue selling fuel, he
said
he didn't know at the present
time, but that at some places they
did,
and other they did not.
He further stated that a large
shed would be built to house all
the material in the yard, as soon
as the frost was out the ground.
Also the new prices went into ef
fect Monday morning of this week.
He says that the Thompson Yards
Inc., are not here to run anybody
out of business, but they are here
to do business the Thompson way.
He says that the prices on lumber
have dropped quite a great deal,
owing to the fact that this com
pany owns their own stumpage
and mills, thus shipping direct,
saving the consumer the middle
man's profits.
This company has an architect
department, and their plan book
for buildings of all kinds would
be here any day, and lliat anybody
buying of this tirm, could use the
plan book free of charge.
This company is out to erect a
number of silos in this vicinity
and are only going to erect so
many. The club offer starts Feb.
1st, and will close as soon as the
amount of applications are receiv
ed to make up Hie limit.
Mr. McQuoid said that just as
soon as lie can find a suitable
house lie will move his family
here from Chafl'ee.
LAYMEN'S CONVENTION
IS NOW IN SESSION
Twelve hundrcci men of North
Dakota and western Minnesota
this week enrolled themselves and
paid the fee to attend the Lay
men's Missionary (Convention now
being held in i.lie Masonic Temple
at Fargo. The (Convention opened
with a great hanquesf yesterday
evening which was the greatest
thing of its kind ever held in the
Northwest. Regis! rat ons kept
coming in so rapidly thai on Mon­{the
day before the Convention opened
Wednesday arrangements had to
be made l'or ail overflow banquet
which was held in the Knights' of
Columbus hall. Both banquets
were very successful, the speak
ers were carried from one build
ing to the other iu automobile*.
The theme for the addresses ol
the evening was "The (Coining
World Democracy." the speakers
were l-'red H. Fisher, Hcrbei
Johnson and Morris W. Klines.
Between 90 and 10(1 towns in
North Dakota and Minnesota sent
delegates to this convention, this
being the highest number of
towns outside the convention city
represented at any convention of
the series of 75. Boston, Mass..
holding the honor up to this time.
One of the great attractions
was Gilbert, the moving picture
man, who sustained his reputa
tion of being the greatest moving
picture star in the country. All
the other speakers measured up
to the reputation which they had
won in the east during the fall
campaign.
It is safe to say that never be
fore in the history of the North
west has such a great convention
been held either for a religious or
secular purpose. The churches of
this whole territory have received
such an impetus as will put them
in a position which it, would have
taken years to work to in the ord
inary way.

YOUNQQUIST-LEHMAN
One of the many surprises of
recent times to a large circle of
friends of the contracting parties,,
was when the announcement was
made of the marriage of Mr. Her.
bert Youngquist of this city and
Miss Anna Lehman of Brecken
ridge.
The wedding was a very quiet
one, the only witnesses to the ty
ing of the knot were Mr. John
Diedrich of this city, and Miss
Mary Lehman, sister of the bride.
The marriage ceremony took
place in the parsonage of St. Mary
Church of Breckenridge, Rev. Fr.

THE WAHPETON TIMES
WAHPETON IN GIGANTIC FIGHT
FOR THE PACKING PLANT
Whether this snow storm which

there is going to be something do

State Equity Packing Plant to
opinion that everybody at the

bringing of this plant to this city,

THAT NEW SRI DOE
During the county commis

weeks ago, it was agreed to meet
with the Wilkin county commis
sioners to consider the matter of
building a bridge across the Bois
de Sioux river east of Fairmount.
The commissioners met as agreed
and a motion was made by August
Hoefs of Richland, seconded by
Grau of Wilkin, that a bridge be
built across the Bois de Sioux.
Motion carried. The bridge will
be of steel,, 100 foot span and be
18 foot wide and have a concrete
floor and concrete abutments.
The bridge proposition has
been a serious set back to Fair

on

ST. PAUL CARNIVAL WEEK
A large Number of Citizens From
Wahpeton Are Invited to At
tend This Outdoors Carnival
Wahpeton and Richland Coun
ty people have a direct interest in
the big Outdoor Sports Carnival
which will be staged in St. Paul,
Jan. 27 to Feb. 5th, because it
was promoted and is being man
aged by George W. Woods, who
will be remembered as the secre
tary of the Richland County Fair
in 1913.
Mr. Woods has been unusually
successful in the amusement
lield, since leaving Wahpeton, but
lie admits that he got his first
real experience in that line while
secretary of the local fair. Last
year lie promoted and managed a
three-day automobile aviation
meet in Oklahoma City. During
the past two years he has staged
automobile races all over the
United States, including the meets
held at the Grand Forks and Far
go fairs last season.
Louis W. Hill, president of the
Great Northern railway is presi
dent of the Outdoor Sports Car
nival association. Most of the. big
business men in St. Paul belong
to one or more of the marching
clubs and they wear their blanket
uniforms to ajid from their places
of business. The city is in gala at
tire for the occasion and the num
erous toboggan slides, ski jumps,
hockey, curling and skating rinks
are crowded to capacity every day
and evening.
Iu a leter to the editor, Mr.
Woods slates that he is consider
ing an olYer to put on a big stam
pede for the coming summer. It
will lie in the nature of the Chey

Wallace Coburn, the Cowboy poet,
and Pete Russell, the cowboy ar
tist, have promised to co-operate
with him in the projcct.
