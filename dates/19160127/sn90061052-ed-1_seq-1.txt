most nf tlie business houses readily
agreed to the plan
It I being hIioWii that the credit
system to be adopted will alone much
more than pay the dues for everv mer
chant member otitic club It must
be plainly understood that a fair credit
system such as Is being considered will
be an advantage alul not a hardship to
any person who nlcets his obligations
The credit mtlim df imv nmti lUtnil mi

on whether he- is rich or poor but
simply on the proposition Does he
meet bis obligations Of course if
misfortune ocrakes rt man that too
will bo noted JsiUurally everybody

influence of suchu system will be worth
much to the community Business
