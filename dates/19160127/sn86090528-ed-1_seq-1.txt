side In Minco, the town in which the
Killing took place.

can soldiers had no right to be on
Mexican soil and that Mexican offi
cials were acting within their rights
if they placed them under arrest.
If tha reports that American troops
crossed the river to rescue American?

apologies will close the incident.

Spirit of Leader Broken and He Mores
Like Man in Trance; Delegates Desert
Denouncing Management; Auto
Salesman Stays on Job
By CHARLES P. STEWART,
(United Preses Staff Correspondent.)
THE HAGUE, Jan. 15. (By Mail.)
Henry Ford's peace mission failed for
lack of "faith." According to his own
statement faith was Ford's sole stock
A-hen he started. He had not enough
and those who accompanied him, with
.1 few exceptions, appear to have had
jut little.
Those of the party who really wish
ed the expedition well, were so bitterly
hated that an effort was made to ma
roon a number of them at the first
European port touched. Ford's plan
as nearly as it is possible to put so
intangible a thing on paper, was to
give the warring nations mental
science treatment. Ford himself at
the outset had unbounded faith in his
ability. Despite the statement at
tributed to him that he intended to
"get the boys out of the trenches
by Christmas," he did not count on im
mediately ending the war.
What Ford did believe was that he
could "make a dent"' by gathering
about him a whole ship's company,
uniting the members mds on one
'big thought of peace," and continual
ly adding to the volume and intensity
of this thought as he and his crusad
ers traveled from neutral country to
neutral country, on the edge of the
zone of war, or even in the zone it
self.
Whether this plan would have suc
ceeded under favorable circumstances
can't be staled, because the peace
delegates failed to concentrate or.
thoughts of peace. The Oscar IPs voy
age from New York to Christiania was
horrible, nor so much because of tho
incessant nu&rreling as on account of
the atmosphere of suspicion and
malice after the first day or two out.
Ford speedily took to his cabin and
for more than half the trip was hard
ly seen by any but his closest advis
ors. He was ill, it was stated. The
nature of the illness never was made
clear. Several of the correspondents
whom the expedition's managing com
mittee was trying to separate from the
party did see the patient for a fe-v
minutes the night before the Oscar
II's arrival at Christiania. It is true
that he looked like a sick man, but
1-is malady seemed rather of the spirit
than the body.
Ford moved and spoke like 9 persou
in a semi-trnnce. He seemed almost
completely broken. Early in (he voy
age he declared that squabbling among
the peace delegates was a snull mat
ter, that disagreements were to be ex
pected in any community, and that
when the party landed at Christiania
These troubles would quickly disap
pear. On this night, however, his
manner suggested that he realized the
fundamental weakness of his organiza
tion that he had lost hope.
While Ford admitted that he based
his early hopes only on faith, Mme.
Rosika Schwimmer declared she had
written assurances from officials of
al lthe neutral European governments
that they would welcome such an ef
fort as the one undertaken by Ford
and from men in high positions at the
chancellories of certain of the warring
nations "on both sides" that they were
at least not unfriendly to the plan. The.
secone. day of the party's stay in Chris
tiania Premier Kundsen of Norway
denied the truth of her statement. Nu
merous cables received in Chri3tiania
from Mme. Schwimmer, addressed to
peace organizations and discussing ar
rangements for the Ford party's re
ception and for co-operation in peace
A-oik. still lay in the Christiania teV;
graph officerbecau.se there were no
burn organizations to deliver them to.
