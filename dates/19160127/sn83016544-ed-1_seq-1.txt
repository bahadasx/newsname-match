ENCOURAGING FOR CREAMERY
that a creamery is necessary to pro
mote and develop tl.e farming in-
It is gratifying to us to present
this, as our judgment of the jcream
ery project and of the public spii'it
edness of our merchants was abso­
lutely correct. Of course we do
not wish our farmers to plunge too
hastily, as a project of this nature
at this point requires more than sim­
ply the construction of the cream­
ery. We have every confidence in
our farmers and feel that with the
matter in their hands it will be
cared for. A great deal more mon­
ey will be necessary to build and
equip the creamery. Still more
will have to be put into cows.
We will turn the list over to the
Creamery Association and will offer
t«i Circulate the list further as we
know that Grand Marais citizens
are never lacking in public spirit
for a worthy enterprise.
John McKay Missing.
John McKay who has been fish­
ing with Abe Falkner at Susie Is­
land has been missing for about
three weeks and it is feared that he
is drowned.
Mr. McKay and Mr. Falkners
were fishing on a partnership
basis until about three weeks ago
when they decided to separate and
Mr. McKay packed up his belong­
ings and started for his own island
some distance away. He has not
been seen since and the skiff has
not been found anywhere in the
neighborhood. It seems that Mr.
McKay was going to lift a couple
of nets on his way to his own home
and we are informed that one of the
nets was quite hard to handle on ac­
count of the current or the way it
was set. Mr. Falkner is ot the
opinion that while lifting these nets
he made a misstep and fell over­
board and was drowned.

ROAD THRU NATIONAL FOREST
Build Road Through Superior
National Forest.
If a bill which Senator Knute Nelson
introduced in congress on Dec. 10 pas­
ses, the IJnited States government will
be pledged to build a road through the
lies in the northern ends of St. Louis,
a°d
Cook counties, and which is
said to be a wonderland of beauty.
The bill, which has been referred to
th on a([riou|lure anll fm_
opposite appropriation of $50,000 for the con­
struction of the pruposed highway. It
directs that construction shall be under
supervision of the secretary of agricul­
ture, and that the road shall begin at a
point along the north shore of Lake Su­
perior, and follow a northerly direction
through the forest.
With the completion of the Duluth
Port Arthur road, wnich will be fit for
automobile use, the road through the
forest reserve will open up a new world
for sight-seeing parties, and, it is be­
lieved, will do a great deal to enhance the
value of this section of the state as a
part of the nation worth coming miles
by auto to look over. Already rich in
beauty, so far as the accessible country
is concerned, and being advertised by
those who have come as tourist pioneers,
as it were, the new territory will, it is
felt, prove a still greater magnet.
The Superior national forest reserve is
so difficult of access at present that few
people, even of those living at its bor­
ders, have seen it, and those of the pre­
sent time who have explored it, it is
claimed, could be counted on the fin­
gers of two hands. It comprises about
a million and a half acres and abounds
in wild game. The entire country is so
dotted with lakes, and so many streams
and rivdrs wind about within its bor­
ders, that canoeists have found it im­
possible to travel many miles without
making very difficult portages.
A good road, built with the govern
ifUnit's thoroughness, would solve the
problem to a large extent, it is thought,
and would result in the gradual develop­
ment of otjxer roads, which in time
would open up the whole reserve to the
"auto tribe" for sight-seeing and camp­
ing.
The action of Senator Nelson, who is
deeply interested in the north oountry,
is the result of a trip that was made
through the reserve by George J. Brad­
ley, Norwood, two years ago, while he
was president of the state game and fish
commission. Mr. Bradley was so im­
pressed by the beauty of tbe reserve
that on the return from his trip he
wrote to Senator Nelson, suggesting
that a road should be built through it.
Since then Senator Nelson has made an
investigation, and concluded that Mr.
Bradley was right, hence the bill,
"The nation has in this forest preserve
one of the beauty spots of the world"
said Mr. Bradley. "Some years ago the
state made a game preserve of practic­
ally the same territory. Those who
travel through this wonderfully beau­
tifully region encounter all sorts of
wild life.
"Un the trip I made with other mem­
bers of the commission we saw many
moose, deer, and other big game. It is
said that carribou, supposed to be ex­
tinct, still are to be found in this coun­
try.
"Probably it is as well that it has not
previously been made accessible, for
game and some of the natural beauties
of the country might have beeu destroy­
ed. Now both the timber and the wild
life are protected, and Minnesota
should be able to boast a national park
hardly excelled in beauties by the Yel­
lowstone.
It is difficult to believe that in Minne­
sota there is a park of this magnitude
aQd
of suoh beauties, yet practically un
known to our people. A road through
the wonderland would throw open to
Minnesota and to the nation a marvel­
ous national recreation ground.
