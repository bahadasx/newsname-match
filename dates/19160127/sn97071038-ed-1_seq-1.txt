New Schedule F.ffects Hermiston
Very Little.
Commencing Sunday morning the
Coyote cut-off was put into service by
the O-W, R. & N. It has been some
thing like 15 years since the railroad
officials drat started surveys for the
cut-off. Even after the line was
graded, completion was delayed a
year. The cut-off saves about 11
miles in distance and some very bad
grades and curves, which Is import
ant for the heavy through trains.
So far as Hermiston is concerned
we have practically as good as be
fore. Train No. 19, formerly passing
here at 6 a. m., was the only thing
asked for that was not granted. This
would have made traveling to Port
land much more convenient and ex
press shipments went out on it large
ly.
As the new schedule now stands
we have the motor both ways as for
merly, also the local. In addition to
this we have the early morning train
from Portland.
Outgoing and incoming east and
west mail service is the same as for
merly, while a letter will now reach
Spokane 11 hours earlier. The night
mall train from the east carries our
mail to Arlington where It is trans
ferred to No. 6 and brought back at
a. m., together with Portland mail.
Everything mailed after the morn
ing local and before the afternoon
local Is taken by the latter to Pen
dleton and placed on the proper
train. The motor" In the evening
takes the last mail to Umatilla where
it is placed on the trains to or from
Spokane. By connecting with the
train to Spokane mall will reach that
city at 7 a. m. the following morn
ing where formerly it was not deliv
ered until 6 p. m. of the following
day, thus saving 11 hours which In
reality meant 24 hours because of
reaching there at night. Hermiston
Herald.
We' are glad to report that Mrs.
Ann Minor Is much improved at this
time. Her trouble was the out
growth of a bad attack of neuralgia.
Her daughter, Mrs. Delia Hallock, of
Portland, Is now with her.

MAN SUPPOSED LOST
BRINGS HOME FORD
Probably the greatest excite
ment that has occurred in lone
since the time Dick Turpln be
came lost while hunting rabbits
in the Juniper canyon couutry,
was oca('uioned in that city last
week when Rev. Clarence Rey
nolds, who had started out on
a similar expedition failed to
come home until a searching
party had been organized to
look for the missing man.
It was then that the missing
hunter appeared on the streets
of the city driving Dr. Chlck'g
Ford car. Starting out on foot,
with gun in hand, Clarence had
come upon the doctor's car,
stranded several days before in
a snow bank. Mr. Reynolds
decided he would tide back to
town and after four hours of
persistent cranking, his labors
were rewarded as aforesaid,
and the searching party im
mediately disbanded. .
ENTERTAINMENT PLEASES
The Wells Entertainers presented
the fourth number of the Lyceum
course to a large audience last eve
ning at the High school auditorium,
and to say they made a decided "hit"
would be putting it very mildly in
deed. The program consisted of
songs, readings and dramatic
sketches and in each part of the pro
gram this versatile couple demon
strated their extraordinary ability.
The first part of the program was
taken up with duets and solos and
called forth from the audience much
applause and appreciation. Mr. Wells
possesses a very pleasing bass voice
while Mrs. Wells has a good soprano
voice and the combination was ex
cellent, while In the solo work each
performed to a good advantage. In
the rer.dlngs and monologues they
made an impression which will not
soon be forgotten.. Mrs. Wells gave
her clipping of the book "Pollyanna"
and made many friends for the little
homeless girl and her "glad game,"
and Mr. Wells presented several pop
ular pieces which took well with the
appreciative listeners. . There were
several songs given in costume and
these pleased the younger people In
the audience particularly.
The two dramatic sketches pre
sented showed the Wells Entertainers
possessed dramatic ability on a par
with anything seen in this city for a
long time.
On a whole the program was ex
cellent and worthy of a much larger
company of artists and the large au
dience seemed more than satisfied
with the treat they received.
L
The following are the officers of
Doric Lodge No. 20, Knights of Py
thias, for the ensuing term; Chan
cellor Commander, Loy M. Turner;
Vice-Chancellor, J. A. Waters; Prel
ate, M. L. Case; Master of the Work,
D. M. Ward; Keeper of Records and

Arms, R. N. Crawford; Inner Guard,
A. R. Crawford; .Outer Guard, F. N.
Christensen.
The Knights are preparing for
their annual memorial meeting which
this year will take place on the 15th
of February. A very Important fea
tiirn nf thin meeting will he the nres-
! entatlon of veterans' jewels to seVen
members who have belonged to the
order for twenty-five years or long
er. An appropriate program is being
arranged in which the Grand Chan
cellor, Wlllard L. Marks, of Albany,
and the Grand Keeper of Records
and Seal, Walter G. Gleeson, of Port
land, will participate. Plans are also
being laid for a spread. Whether or
not this will eclipse former efforts of
hDorlc No. 20, can not now be predict
ed, as the Knights have a valuable
reputation, to. sustain, but certain it
is that the feed will be up to standard
which will mean much to those who
are fortunate enough to be present.
Those entitled to jewels are, Phlll
Cohn, W. B. Barratt and J. W. Cow
ins, of Heppner; Vawter. Crawford,,
of lone; J. R. Simons and E. R. Hun
lock, of Portland; and Sterling Keith
ley, of Napa, California. It is hoped
that all of the recipients may be
present on this occasion, but owing
to the distance some of them would
have to travel the ' presenting . will
probably be confined to the brothers
residing at Heppner and- nearby
points.

TROYED BY FLAMES
The farm house of George Glass on
the old Basey farm in Clarks Canyon
was completely destroyed by fire
about 10 o'clock last Saturday morn
ing. The fire, starting in the kitchen,
gained such rapid headway that Mr.
Glass and his family were barely able
to escape the names without injury.
The cause of the fire is unknown.
All the contents of the house, in
cluding enough provisions to last a
year, were burned with the house.
One daughter, it is reported, in an
upstairs room succeeded in escaping
from the building only after her
clothing has been partly burned from
her body.
Mr. Glass and his family have been
living on the Basey place about a
year.
Exposition Name Changed. '
The scope of the San Diego Exposi

Italy, Germany, Austria, Brazil, The
Netherlands, and Switzerland, are in
stalling big displays the greater
part of them brought from the San
Francisco Exposition. Other features
of the beautiful Exposition have been
enlarged so that the dedication of
the new Exposition, March 15, is
more than a matter of form.
Farmers Meeting Postponed.
The annual meeting of the Farm
ers' Union of Morrow County which
was to have been held at the court

poned until Saturday, February 5
The reason given for the postpon

Oregon Woolgrowers Association,
who was in attendance at the con
vention. The attendance was near
the 1000 mark.
The address delivered by the Na

dealt with the forest reserves ques
tion, the enactment of the 640-acre
homestead bill, foreign Imports and
disease, predatory animals, Inter
state regulations and shipping and
conditions affecting the woolgrower
generally. The convention was also
addressed by Professor F. R. Mar

which Prof. Marshall had made of
conditions In Australia of the cli
mate and management, the type of
