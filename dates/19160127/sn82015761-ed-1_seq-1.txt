Number 11
WILLIAMS AND
ITS ENVIRONS
The world is wide even in Ari
zona and nowhere will you find a
greater variety of altitude and cli
mate. The plateau - of northern
Arizona is nearly a mile higher
than the Salt River Valley, and be
tween the two are all gradations of
altitude and climate. Coming from
Williams to Tucson I passed from
bleak winter to budding spring.
This northern plateau might be
called an immense mountain hund
reds of thousands of square miles
in area with projecting peaks here
and there.
Covering this prodigious plateau
are the Tusayan and Grand Can
yon National Forests, which might
be likened to a long green ribbon
stretched loosely across the desert.
In the midst of this forest park
the town of Williams is most for.
tunately situated. It nestles in a
clearing Burrounded by pine clad
hills which protect it from wind
and frost and give it a milder tem
perature than any other town in
the northern plateau.
fIt furnishes to the tourist a most
delightful stopping place in the
midst of a trans-continental jour
ney an enjoyable rest on the way
to California.
Those holding tickets to the
Grand Canyon have ample time at
Williams between trains for the
ascent of Bill ' Williams mountain
which rises near the town to a
height of 9,000 ft. The trip can
be made in five hours on horse ,
'' back in perfect safety. The trail
is an easy one leading through a
gently sloping path of pines, then
steeply up to the summit alongside
a stream bordered by thickets of
quaking aspen. Grass and ferns
cushion the banks and flowers riot
in their season. ,
On the summit is buried the
historic pioneer scout, Bill Will
iams. From his " resting place
there is a wide outlook. Looking
north is the wall of the Grand Can
yon, south the Jerome Smelters,
east San Francisco Peaks, Sit
greaves and Kendrick mountains,
west Ash Fork and Hell's Canyon.
The panorama commands a terri
tory of over 50,000 sq. miles.
Beyond the circle of definite vis
ion are vague, shadowy contours
that give an impression of vast
ness. Williams i3 the gateway to the
Grand Canyon- The Grand Can
yon is one of the few spots that is
not over advertised. It never has
been described and never will be,
not even by such artists as the
painter Moran or the lecturers,
Stoddard and Holmes. ,
It is a great underworld and
seems as vast as the earth " itself.
The beholder gets little idea of de
tails but is overwhelmed by a stu
pendous panorama which is never
twice the same. The Bright Angel
and El Tovar hotels give excellent
service.
(Continued next week)
Receives Du Pont Trophy
F. M. Gold, received a long
run trophy from the Du Pont
Powder Co. this week, in recog
nition of the fine shooting done
at the Williams and Phoenix am
atuer tournaments. The trophy
is in the form of a gold watch
fob and two bars, with two re
cords made at the two shoots
and the winners name engraved
upon it. One bar is for the re
cord of 54 straight, made at the
Williams shoot, and the other is
for the record of 55 straight
made at Phoenix. Mr. Gold says
that he is in for a try at the
state championship, next year.
He tied for seventh place this
season.

Derailment on Canyon Road
A derailment occured onthe Canyon
Road, last Sunday morning about
11 o'clock. . Engine 811, drawing
one passenger car, left the track
and turned over on its side. The
coach was not ' upset. Engineer
Phillips jumped and suffered a
severe ankle spraiu. Fireman G.
H. Oltman stayed with the engine
and remained unhurt. Trainmast
er Duffield and Roadmaster Moore
ran out on the "'wrecker" and got
the engine back on the track about
3 o'c'ock, Monday afternoon.
Passengers and baggage were trans
ferred past the wreck until the
track was cleared.
Mr. Editor:
There are yet a few citizens in
our school district' who think we
need a $30,000 high school build
ing at the present time. However,
most of our taxpayers, and es
pecially our heavy permanent tax
payers, feel that such would be
reckless extravagance.
I have just received a communi
cation from the Willcox Union
High School which shows the fol
lowing figures: Approximate cost
of building $6,000, Cost of equip
ment $1,000. Number of rooms 8.
Number of high school pupils en
rolled 63. This shows only seven
thousand dollars to handle sixty
three enrolled. Now why should
it be necessary to vote $30,000 for
our small high school?
Again, our district has a class of
citizens who think that the only
way to build up a good high school
is to "baby" the high school stu
dents by placing before them all
the luxuries possible. -We believe
in necessaries but can't agree with
the part of expending for luxuries.
When we have to "baby" our boys
and girls to get them to attend
high school we had just as well
turn them into the world without a
high school education. Who is
going to give them "flowery beds
of ease" when they get out into the
business world? Let them learn
real values in school; let them
learn necessaries only while they
are students and they will make
better citizens.
Yours truly

a depth of 29 feet and a great deal
of damage is reported to towns on

Post Script: It is rumored that
the friends of Fletcher Bly are
planning to evoke the recall on

the election recently held 'was
unfair and illegal insomuch as
former mayor Bly was at the
time in the south looking after
his other flock of sheep.

would advise the citizens of
Anita to keep their election of a
Justice of the Peace under their
hat, a3 Judge Ferrell of the Can

this is an encroachment upon his
territory. .

"KILLED HIM THAT '
TIME ALL RIGHT"
Last Saturday forenoon No. 2
and No. 8 were combined in mak
ing the run to Flagstaff. When
passing thru a cut within a few
miles of Flagstaff, the air brakes
suddenly set and the train came to
a standstill. None of the train
crew knew why the train had stop
ped, the engineers least of all.
The flagman got down at once
and ran back to flag anything that
might come up behind. When
about half way back along the side
of the train he caught sight of a
bed quilt farther on ahead that
was freshly saturated with some
thing red. "We killed him all
right that rime." he shouted to an
other member of the crew.
They had killed someone allright
but not an ordinary person. From
a few broken barrel staves and
hoops they identified him as old
John Barleycorn, himself. A deep
scar on the embankment at the
side of the railroad cut, showed
where the keg in which he was im
prisoned had struck with great
force., Evidently someone inside
was afraid of being caHight in his
company and had hurled him thru
a window. Sheriff Dickinson has
been working up something of a
reputation for being able to ' spot
the man with the goods, was prob
ably the indirect cause of poor
John s violent end, in this case.
