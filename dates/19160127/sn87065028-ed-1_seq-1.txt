To Vott on Proposition to luue
Bond in Sum of $50,000
Next Tuesday.
The finh t for the proponed Issu
ance of bond in the sum of $50 V)
for the erection and equipment of a
new high school builtlinjt, which
proportion U to be submitted to the
qualified elector of the Columbia
rehool district at a special election
to be held next Tuesday, February 1
in being led by the ladies of the city
and contiguous territory, many of
whom are members of the Civic
Leaue, which organization has been
he recognized sponsor of the move
ment since its inception.
The very fact that the ladies of
Columbus and its environs are at the
head of the undertaking is ample
proof of its worthiness, for these
ladies are noted for their civic pride
and for they interest which they con
tinually manifest in the upbuilding
of the city, and never have they
championed a cause unless fully con
vinced that it would accrue to the
general welfare of Columbus and
Columbians.
It is universally admitted that the
need of a new high school building
is an urgent one, and the only objec
tion advanced by those opposing the
movement is that the issuance of the
bonds will increase their taxes. The
resultant increase, however, will bt
very slight, and every property
owner in the district should be will
ing to bear his share of the added
expense in order to secure adequate
educationalr-advahtages for our boys
and girls.
Columbus is in a good fix finan
cially. There is money in the munic
ipal treasury and the tax rate is
lower here than in many cities of
similar size and where practically
the same general conditions prevail
These cities are not standing back
because times are hard; but are go
ing ahead erecting school housef
and making other improvements, and
if Columbus fails to vote the pro
posed bonds it will not only be un
just to the children, but will stamp
her children as being backward and
totally lacking in public spirit.
Our children are our most pres-
cious possessions, being far dearei
to us than gold or the things that
gold can buy, and surely we owe it
to them to provide for their bodily
comfort and mental welfare by giv
ing them an up-to-date high schoo'
building with modern equipment
where they will not only have better
advantages from an educational
viewpoint but will be made thor
oughly comfortable and contented
by more salutary surroundings.

RECEIVES IMPETUS
ENTHUSIASTIC MEETING
OF COMMISSIONERS
MELD TUESDAY.
PLANS MADIi FOR
COUNTY KOUTK
Meeting Presided Over by
Hon. T. J. Locke, Jr., Who
Made Fine Speech.
Construction of the Mississippi
route of the proposed Jackson high
way received a splendid impetus
Tuesday afternoon, when commis
sioners of the several separate road
taxing districts of the county held
a meeting at the Chamber of Com
merce, and formed tentative plans
for the building of the road from
the Alabama state line on the north
to the Noxubee county line on the
south, which will complete the great
memorial thoroughfare so far at
Lowndes county is concerned.
The meeting was presided
over by Hon. T. J. Locke, Jr., presi
dent of the second district road com
mission, who delivered a forceful
address in which he urged co-operation
and concerted action upon the
part of the commissioners of the dif
ferent local road taxing districts,
declaring this to be the only man
ner in which Lowndes county could
ever hope to construct her portion
of the proposed highway.
The plans as outlined and practi
cally agreed upon at the meeting
held Tuesday afternoon provide not
only for the completion of the Jack
son Highway from the Alabama
state line to Noxubee county but
make provision for the construc
tion of connecting links between the
different roads that have already
been improved, thus giving Lowndes
county a core-leto and unbroken
tiihift of 'modern "public highways. '"
The different road taxing dis
tricts of the county were represent
ed at the meeting by the following
commissioners: District two, Messrs.
Thomas J. Locke, Jr., D. D. Stephen
son and B. A. Weaver, represented
by Mr. Locke; Artesia district, Dr.
N. D. Guerry, Mr. S. T. Pilkington
and Mr. J. S. Billups; Gilmer and
Macon road, special district, Mr. T.
K. Swope, Mr. C. W. Evans, Mr.
Jack Cox, represented by the latter
two members of the commission:
Bent Oak Separate district, Mr. A.
E. Herring, Sr., Mr. J. A. Hardy and
Mr. J. T. Lloyd; District four, Mr.
W. E. Cox, Mr. W. D. Ledbetter and
Mr. S. F. Potts.

Washington, Jan. 2.' l'n-;ujili-fied,
rion partisan support of mili
tary preparedness whs urged today
by Minority Leader Mann, in a ring
ing speech in the House. He va
heartily and repeatedly applauded
by both sides of the chamber.
While it has been understood th'l
most of the Republicans favoied
army nod navy increases, until tod.iy
none of their leaders had spoken on
the subject. Consequently, romint:
as it did on the eve of the Presi
dent's departure on a preparednes
speaking tour, Mr. Mann's addrest
was regarded as particularly signi'-
leant, ne remaiKeu nimseir mat m
always bad been known as a "small"
army and navy man.
Representative Mann based hb
plea on the ground that it behoove
the United States now to prepare
for any eventualities that may re
sult rom the European war. He de
clared that he saw no immediate
danger of war and hoped that peace
might prevail, but that the dangei
of the United States being drawn
into the present conflict or one that
might result from it, was too great
to be disregarded.
"I have much more fear in the
end of war with England than 1 have
of war with Germany," he said. That
was his only comment on this phase
of his subject. loiter he declined t
elaborate on his remark.
Mr. Mann urge! no particular
preparedness plan. lie said he favor
ed a standing arm f 250,(100 oi
300, OttO, or even half a million men
better coast defenses and "a navy
which will be able to defend us on
the sea." He promised to go into
these details at greater length later
"1 think that we ought to provide
these great forces," said be in plead
in; for a non-partisan view of the
ouestion. "That it ought to be con
sidered an emergency matter, en

P.ill Providing Tor Law Evam
ining Hoard Alto Passed by
the Senate.
ijmte a number of important
meinuies came up fur consideration
in the State Senate at Jackson
Monday. The Senate, sfter prolong
ed debate and discussion, passed the
Crawley lill, providing for a state
board of examiners, to be appointed
by the governor, to pass on all ap
plicants to practice law in Missis
sippi. This meiins should the bill be
enacted and become of effect that
would-be law practitioners through
out the state, instead of going out
and looking up a chancellor to pass
upon their legal learning, must ap
pear before a qualified examining
board, just as is the case with those
who aspire to medicine, dentistry,
pharmacy, veterinary surgery or
professional nursing, to be tested as
to their learning, mental and moral
equipment for admission to practi
tioner's ranks.
At its afternoon session the Sen
ate passed a bill introduced by Mr.
Boddie, providing for a fee of 15
rents to each circuit clerk in the
county for recording certificates of
carriers upon deliveries of intoxi
cants. The fee is to be paid by the
consignee of such goods, and (m.
every shipment entered the clerk is
to receive 15 cents. In some coun
ties this will amount to considerable
in the way of added personal incre
ment to the clerk, and will offset
the slumps in marriage license fee.
By adopting the House concurrent
resolution incorporating the su
preme court enlargement and elec
tive judiciary amendments into the
constitution, the Senate completed
the last step towards making the
new system of force and effect, and
immediately upon this action, the
old order changed entirely, and the
novernor immediately announced
his choice for the three new seatj
on the bench.
The moment that the amendments
had been regularly incorporated the
new system, as held by Governor
Bilbo and the Legislature, had gone
into effect, the old order had chang
ed and the time was ripe for the
j; jvernor, by executive action, to
fill out the places thus created on
the increased bench by substantive
.appointments.
Directly after being unofficially
informed by newspaper men of the
concurrent action of the Senate
Gov. Bilbo nnnounced that he would
select as the acting appointees, to
hold until three judges can be elect
ed, Clayton D. Potter, of Hinds, for
the First district; J. Bert Holden, of
Pike, Second district, and Octave O.
Sykes, Jr., of Monroe, Third dis
trict. The selection of Hon. E. O. Sykes
of Aberdeen, as one of the new su
preme court justices is very gratify
ing to his constituents in this section
of the state. The new appointee is
a son of the late Judge E. O. Sykes.
who for many years was judge of
the First circuit court district,
which during a greater portion of
his incumbency included Lowndes
county, and is recognized as an able
and astute lawyer. He is popular
not only in this immediate section
but throughout the state, and not
only his friends but those of his la
mented father are exceedingly glad
to note that his ability has received
official recognition.
