WASHINGTON, DC Jan. 27.
-Ahlough no specific announce
ment has been made, it is almost
certain that S. C. HuIkt of Tama,
Iowa, will be selected for United
States district attorney for Hawaii.
Mr. Huber is a prominent attor
s ney and Democratic politician of
Jowa, He was recently in Wash-
ington ly request of administration
- leaders and talked over the sitiu;-
tion in I la waii with Attorncy-gcn-
cral Gregory and others,
; He is pronounced now the "best
bet', for the. position.
M C. S. ALBERT.
M'CARN SAID TO BE AT
WORK AGAINST JUDGES'
ROBERTSON AND WHITNEY
The rumored selection of the Iowa
; roan, Huber, as district attorney for
Hawaii comes as an entire surprise
I to local politicians. It Is now conjee
:1 tured that the attorney-general and
the president regard Senator Coke as
. technically disqualified from serving,
- as previous reports were almost un-
anlmous in saying that Coke was first
choice for the place held by Jeff Mc
; Carn of Tennessee during two stormy
f Ars and now temporarily nelSvbjf
1 lorace WTvaugaaij of Texas. '
C . Coke's disqualification arises from
the fact that nis term a a territorial
senator still continues and under the
r. crganlc act he cannot take such aq
r Appointive position as the district at
.torneyshlp. -
v-Whether. McCarn has been backing
Huber for 'the position Is not known
here. His fight on Vaughan la cer
tainly being kept up; Furthermore. It
' Is reported on good authority that
' McCarn Is organizing a fight in the
U. S. Senate against the confirmation
of two Hawaii Judges given recess ap
pointments, by the president Chief
' Justice Robertson and Circuit Judge
Whitney. It Is said that ; McCarn
' hopes thfct he can line up enough Dem
ocratic votes in the senate to defeat
their confirmation on the ground that
I they are Republicans, and that, he
claims , further, they are f under
; the influence of the "big Interests"
r here a set of charges In thia regard
f Bomewhat similsr to those by Circuit
; Judge Stuart against Justices Robert
I son and Watson. ' ,
' Justice Quarles before leaving for
' the mainland" notions ago was credit
ed with the remark that be would not
return to Hawaii IT the chief justice
were confirmed, but his fellow mem
. bers of the bench and bar do not
; think he would relinquish his position
: on this account.
Were It not for tne fight which Mc
; ' Carn is known to be making on Dis
trict Attorney Vaughan, the reported
pelection of Huber for the IT. S. dis
trict attorney's position would be tak
"7" cn aa heralding the appointment of
Vaughan as federal judge to succeed
: the veteran S..B. Dole. But persist
ent rumors from Washington say that
McCarn's charges, first made by let

HOSPITAL FOR
S
Kauikeolani Seeking to Raise
Endowment to $200,000,
Says President Dole
That the Kauikeolani Children's
HoKDital is somewhat behind as re
gards funds, and has been during the
last year, is tne statement or iioa.
Sanford B. Dole, president of the cor
poration. In' connection with the an
nual meeting of the hospital authori
ties which is being held at the insti
tution, Kuaklni street this afternoon.
The meeting was called for 3 o'clock.
Judge Dole says that the corpora
tion has been seeking additional funds
and that it is desirous that its endow
ment be at least $200,000, which would
give the hospital a sufficient income
to meet all expenses without running
behind. It now costs from 110,000 to
$12,000 each year to conduct the instl-
tlon. ' ;- .
The cost of "maintenance, Judge
Dole added, differs in various years.
The greater the number of patients,
the . greater the .cost he explained;
yet is costs less per person. Taking
everything into consideration, the
president added, the institution is con
ducted quite economically. . ;
Need Nurses Cottage. ,
Judge Dole pointed out the need of
a new nurses' cottage, in order that
their rooms, now located in a wing of
the main building, might be used for
additional quarters for patients. vThe
hospital also needs an addition to. its
contagious ward, he said, and, by way
of explanation, remarked that during
the epidemic of diphtheria about two
years ago, the - government sent a
large number of children tp the insti
tution and tents had to be' put up in
the yard to accommodate many of
them. " ' -v.
When telephoned to ' today. Miss
Janet M. Dewar, superintendent of the
hospital, said that indications are that
the institution will come out in the
clear financially. There are now 25
patients at the hospital.
Reports were to be presented at the
meeting by the following persons and
committees: . ; . v
Audit Company of Hawaii, auditor;
Miss Dewar, superintendent; Dr. R,
W. Benz, attending physician; Dr. W.
C. Hobdy. attending surgeon; E. A,
