SYNOPSIS.
Christopher Hcllcw. a tenderfoot, starts
for the Klondike in a gold rush and pluck
ily works at the back breaking toil of
packing freight.
He meets a beautiful girl. Joy Gastell,
deserts his own party, and lie and Shorty,
a netv acquaintance, hire out to two
wealthy prospectors. Joy has nicknamed
him "Smoke"
Smoke and Shorty befriend a man nam
ed Hreck and nearly perish in attempting
to cross Lake !>obarge because of the
uselessness of their employers.
Smoke and Shorty take command by
force and get through to Dawson City,
where they are discharged. On Greek's
tip they stampede for Squaw creek.
They overtake Joy Gastell and her fa
ther. To help the Sea Dion crowd Joy
treacherously leads them away from
Squaw' creek.
Smoke saves the girl's feet from freez
ing. lie and Shorty by mistake lump a
miner's claim and lose it. Then Smoke
finds Surprise lake, the bottom of which
is covered with gold.
Smoke is shot at. witnesses the murder
of a miner by the unknown marksman
and is arrested for murder himself.
Breck shows a Surprise lake nugget,
the impromptu court is stampeded, and
Smoke's life is saved. Smoke wins money
at roulette.
He continues to win. and the gamblers
buy him off. His system was based on
the discovery that the roulette wheel w'as
warped.
Prompted by Joy Gastell, Smoke enters
a race for a million dollar claim against
some of the best dog mushers.
At a critical moment Joy supplies Smoke
with a fresh dog team, and he runs a
dead heat with Big Olaf for the claim.

tiny glacier that tilled the head of the
valley. "Here it is August already,

don't. But I cau bring up the grub,
while you keep after that mother lode.
So long. I'll be back by tomorrow
evening.''
He turned and started.
"I got n hunch somethin's goin' to
happen," Shorty pleaded after him.
But Smoke's reply was a bantering
laugh. He held ou down the little val
ley, occasionally wiping the sweat from
his forehead, the while his feet crush
ed through ripe mountain raspberries
and delicate ferns that grew beside
patches of sun sheltered ice.
In the early spring he and Shorty
had'come to the Stewart river and
launched out into the amazing chaos
of the region where Surprise lake lay.
And all of the spring and half of the
summer had been consumed in futile
wanderings, when, on the verge of
turning back, they caught their first
giimp.se of the baffling, gold bottomed
sheet of water which had lured aud
fooled a generation of miners.
Making their camp in the old cabin
which Smoke had discovered on - his
previous visit, they learned three
things—first, heavy nugget gold was
carpeted thickly on the lake bottom;
next, tbe gold could be dived for in
the shallower portions, but the temper
ature of the water was man killing,
and, finally, tbe draining of tbe lake
was too stupendous a task for two men
In the shorter half of a short summer.
Undeterred, reasoning from the coarse
ness of the gold that it had not trav
eled far, they had set out in search of
(he mother lode. They hud crossed the
big glacier that frowned on the south
ern rim and devoted themselves to the
puzzling maze of small valleys and
canyons beyond, which, by most un
mountain-like methods, drained, or had
at one time drained, into the lake.
The valley Smoke was descending
gradually widened after the fashion of
any normal valley, but at the lower
end it pinched narrowly between high,
precipitous walls and abruptly stopped
in n cross wall. At tbe base of this, in
a welter of broken rock, the streamlet
disappeared, evidently finding its way
out underground.
Climbing the cross wall, from the top
Smoko saw the lake beneath him. Un
like any mountain lake he had ever,
seen, It was not blue. Instead its In
tense peacock green tokened its shal
lowness. It was this shallowness that
made its draining feasible. All about
arose jumbled mountains, with ice
scarred peaks and crags, grotesquely
shaped aud grouped. All was topsy
turvy and unsystematic— a Dore night
mare.
Across the lake, seemingly not more
than half nmile, but, as be well knew,
five miles away, he cou'.d seethe bunch
of spruce trees and the cabin, lie
looked again to make, sure and saw
smoke clearly rising from the chimney.
Somebody else had surprised them
selves into finding Surprise lake, was
his conclusion as he turned to climb
tbe southern wall.
From the top of this he came down
Into a little valley, flower floored and
lazy with tbe hum of bees, that be
haved quite as a reasonable valley
should, in so far as It made legitimate
entry on tho lake. What was wrong
with it was its length—scarcely 100
yards—its head a straight up and down
cliff of 1,000 feet, over which a stream
pitched itself In descending veils of
mist.
And here he encountered more
smoke, floating lazily upward in the
warm sunshine, beyond an outjet of
rock. As he came around the corner
he heard a light metallic tap-tapping
and a merry whistling that kept the
beat Then be saw tbe man, an up
turned shoe between bis knees, into
tbe sole of which lie was driving hob
spikes.
"Hello!" was the stranger's greet
ing, and Smoke's heart went out to the
man In- ready liking. "Just in time
for a snack. There's coffee in the
pot. a couple of cold flapjacks and
some jerky."
"I'll go you if I lose," was Smoke's
acceptance as he sat down. "I've been
rather skimped on tho last several
meals, but there's oodles of grub over
In the cabin."
"Across the lake? That's what 1
was heading for."
"Seems Surprise lake Is becoming
populous," Smoke complained, empty
ing tbe coffeepot.
"Go on, you're joking, aren't you?"
tbe man said, surprise painted on bis
face.
Smoke laughed. "That's the way It
takes everybody. You see those high
ledges across there to the northwest?
There's where I first saw it No warn
ing. Just suddenly caught the view
of the whole lake from there. I'd giv
en up looking for it too."
"Same here," the other agreed. "I'd
headed back and was expecting to
fetch the Stewart last night when out
1 popped In sight of the lake. If that's
it where's the Stewart? And where
have I been all tbe time? And how
did you come here? And what's your
name?"
"Bellew— Kit Bellew."
"Oh, I know you I" The man's eyes
and face were bright with a Joyous
smile, and his hand flashed eagerly out
to Smoke's. "I've heard nil about you."
He was a slender man. wiry with
health, with quick black eyes and a
magnetism of camaraderie.
"And this is Surprise lake?" he mur
mured incredulously. "And Its hot
tom's buttered with gold?"
"Sure. There's some of the churn
ing." Smoke dipped in bis overalls
I'ock et and brought forth half a dozen
nuggets.
"Well, gosh-dash my dingbats, if you
haven't beaten me to it," Carson swore
whimsically, but his disappointment
was patout. "And 1 thought I'd scoop
ed tho whole caboodle. Anyway, I've
had the fun of getting here."
"Fun!" Smoke cried. "Why, if we
;an ever get our hands on all that bot
tom we'll make Rockefeller look like
30 cents."
"But it's yours," was Carson's objec
tion. . r
"Nothing to it, my friend. Yon've
got to realize that no gold deposit like
it has been discovered in all the histo
ry of mining. It will take you aud me
and my partner and all the friends
we've got to lay our hands on it. All
Bonanza aud Eldorado dumped togeth
er wouldn't be richer than half an acre
down there. The problem is to drain
tho lake. It will take millions. And
there's only ope thing I'm afraid of.
There's so much of it that If we fail to
control the output it will bring about
the demonetization of gold."
"And you tell me"— Carson broke
off, speechless and amazed.
"Am glad to have you.. It will take
a year or two, with all the money we
can raise, to drain the lake. It can be
done. I've looked over the ground.
But it will take every man in the coun
try that's willing to work for wages.
We'll need an army, aud we need right
now decent men in on the ground floor.
Are you in?"
"Am I in? Don't I look it? I feel so
much like a millionaire that I'm real
timid about crossing that big glacier.
Couldn't afford to break my neck now.
Wish I had some more of those hob
spikes. I was just hammering the last
in when you came along. How's
yours? Let's see."
Smoke held up his foot
"Worn smooth as a skating rink!"
Carson cried. "You've certainly been
hiking some. Wait a minute, aud I'll
pull some of mine out for you."
But Smoke refused to listen. "Be
sides," he said, "I've got about forty

ical Effort.
feet of rope cached where we take the
ice. My partner and I used it coming
over. It will be a cinch."
It was a hard, hot climb. Tbe sun
blazed dazzlingly on the ice surface,
and with streaming pores they panted
from the exertion. There were places,
crisscrossed by countless fissures and
crevasses, where an hour of dangerous
toil advauced them no more than a
hundred yards. At 2 in the afternoon
beside a pool of water bedded in the
ice Smoke called a halt
"Let's tackle some of that jerky," he
said. "I've been on short allowance,
and my knees are shaking. Besides,
we're across the worst. Three hundred
yards will fetch us to the rocks, and
it's easy going, except for a couple of
nasty fissures and one bad one that
heads us down toward the bulge.
There's a weak Ice bridge there, but
Shorty and I managed It"
"I'm lighterthnn you by forty pounds,"
Carson said. "Let me go first"
They stood on the edge of the cre
vasse. It was enormous and ancient,
fully 100 fec-t across, with sloping, age
eaten sides instead of sharp angled
rims. At this one place It was bridged
by a huge mass of pressure hardened
snow that was Itself half Ice. Even
the bottom of this mass they could not
see, much less the bottom of the cre
vasse. Crumbling and melting, the
bridge threatened imminent collapse.
"Looks pretty bad." Carson admitted
with an ominous head shake.
"But we've got to tackle It," Smoke
said. "We can't camp here on the ice
all night. And there's no other way.
Shorty and I explored for a mile up. It
was in better shape, though, when wo
crossed."
"It's one at a time, and me first"
Carson took the part coil of rope from
Smoke's hand. "You'll have to cast
off. I'll take the rope and the pick.
Gimme your hand so I can slip down
easy."
Slowly and carefully he lowered him
self the several feet to the bridge,
where he stood, making final adjust
ments for the perilous traverse. Or
bis back was his pack outfit Arouno
his neck, resting on his shoulders. In
coiled the rope, one end of which wac
still fast to his waist.
"I'd give a mighty good part of my
millions right now for a bridge construe
tion gang." he said, but his cheery,
whimsical smile belied the words.
The pick and the long stick he used
as an alpenstock lie balanced horizon
tally after the manner of a ropewalk
or lie thrust one foot forward tenta
tively, drew it hack and steeled him
self with a visiule physical effort.
"I wish X was fiat broke," he smiiea
up. "If ever I get out of being a mil
lionaire this time I'll never be one
again."
"It's all right," Smoke encouraged.
"I've been over it before. Better let
me try It first."
"And you forty pounds to the
worse," the little man flashed back.
"I'll he all right in a minute. I'm all
right now," as his foot went out, this
time to rest carefully and lightly, while
the other foot was brought up and
past
Very gently and circumspectly he
continued on his way until two-thirds
of the distance was covered. Here he
stopped to examine a depression he
must cross, at the bottom of which
was a fresh crack. Smoke, watching,
saw him glance to the side aud down
into the crevasse itself and then begin
a slight swaying.
"Keep your eyes up!" Smoke com
manded sharply. "Now, go on!"
The little man obeyed nor faltered
on the rest of the journey. The sun
eroded slope of the farther edge of the
crevasse was slippery, hut not steep,
and he worked his way up to a nar
row ledge, faced about and sat down.
"Your turn," be called across. "But
just keep a-eoming, and don't look
down. That's what got my goat Just
keep a-coming. that's all. And get a
move on. It's almighty rotten."
Balancing his own stick horizontal
ly, Smoke essayed the passage. That
the bridge was on its last legs was
patent. He felt a jar under foot, a
.slight movement of the mass and a
heavier jar. This was followed by a
single sharp crackle. Behind him he
knew something was happening. If
for no other reason he knew it by the
strained, tense face of Carson. From
beneath, thin and faint, came the mur
mur of running water, and Smoke's
eyes involuntarily wavered to a
glimpse of the shimmering depths. He
jerked them back to the way before
him.
Two-thirds over he came to the de
pression. The sharp edges of the
crack, but slightly touched by tbe sun,
showed how recent it was. His foot
was lifted to make the step across
when the crack began slowly widen
ing, at the same time emitting numer
ous sharp snaps. He made the step
quickly, increasing the stride of it, but
the worn nails of his shoe skated on
(he farther slope of the depression.
He fell on his face aud without pause
slipped down and into the crack, his
legs hanging clear, his chest supported
by the stick, which he had managed
to twist crosswise as he fell.
His first sensation was the nausea
caused by the sickening upleap of his
pulse; his first idea was of surprise
that he had fallen no farther. Behind
him were crackling and jar and move
ment, to which the stick vibrated.
From beneath, in the heart of the gla
cier, came the soft and hollow thunder
of the dislodged masses striking bot
tom. And still (he bridge, broken
from its farthest support and ruptured
in the middle, held, though the portion
he had crossed tilted downward at a
pitch ot twenty degrees.
He couhl see Carson, perched on his
ledge, his feet braced against the melt
ing surface, swiftly recoiling the rope
from his shoulders to his hand.
"Wait!" he cried. "Don't move, or
the whole shooting match will come
down!"
He calculated the distance with a
quick glance, took the bandanna from
his neck and tied it to the rope and
increased the length by a second ban
danna from his pocket The rope,
manufactured from sled lashings and
short lengths of plaited rawhide knot
ted together, was both light and
strong. The first cast was lucky ns
well as deft, and Smoke's fingers
clutched It He evidenced a hand
over hand intention of crawling out of
the crack. But Carson, who had re
fastened the rope around his own
waist, stopped him.
"Make it fast around yourself as
well," he ordered.
"If 1 go I'll take you with me,"
Smoke objected.
The little man became very peremp
tory.
"You shut up!" he ordered.
"If I ever start going"— Smoke be
gan.
"Shut up! You ain't going to ever
start going. Now do what 1 say.
That's right—under the shoulders
Make it fast. Now start. Get a move
on, but easy as you go. I'll take in
the slack. You Just keep a-coming.
That's it Easy, easy."
Smoke was still a dozen feet away
when the final collapse of the bridge
began. Without noise, but in a jerky
way, it crumbled an increasing tilt
"Quick!" Carson called, coiling in
hand over hand on the slack of the
rope which Smoke's rush gave him.
When the crash came Smoke's fin
gers were clawing into the hard face
of the wall of the crevasse, while his
body dragged back with the falling
bridge. Carson, sitting up, feet wide
apart and braced, was heaving on the
rope. This effort swung Smoke in to
the side of the wall, but it Jerked Car
sou out of his niche. Like a cat he
faced about, clawing wildly for a hold
on the ice and slipping down. Be
neath him, with forty feet of taut rope
between them. Smoke was clawing
just as wildly, nnd ere the thunder
from below announced the arrival of
the bridge both men had come to rest
Carson had achieved this first, and the
several pounds of pnll he was able to
put on the rope had helped to bring
Smoke to a stop.
Each lay in a shallow niche, bnt
Smoke's was so shallow that, tense
with the strain of the flattening and
sticking, nevertheless he would have
slid on had it not been for the slight
assistance he took from the roDo. He
was on the verge of a bulge and could
cot see beneath him.
CHAPTER XIV.
Yh# Knife and the Rope.
S ID ERAL minutes passed, (a
which they took stock of the
situation and made rapid
strides in learning the art of
sticking to wet and slippery ice. The
little man was the first to speak.
"Gee!" he said aud a minute later;
"If you can dig in for a moment aud
slack on the rope I cau turn over.
Try it"
Smoke made the effort, then rested
cn the rope again. "1 can do It," he
said. "Tell me when you're ready,
aud be quick."
"About three feet down is holding
for my heels," Carson said. "It won't
take a moment. Are you ready?"
"Go on!"
It was hard work to slide down a
yard, turn over and sit up. But it was
even harder for Smoke to remain flat
tened and maintain a position that
from instant to instant made a greater
call upon his muscles. As it was, he
could feel the almost perceptible begin
ning of tbe slip when the rope tight
ened. and he looked up into his com
panion's face. Smoke noted the yellow
pallor of sun tan, forsaken by the
blood, and wondered what his own
complexion was like. But when he
saw Carson, with shaking Ungers,
fumble for his sheath knife lie decid
ed the end had come. The man was In
a funk and was going to cut the rope.
"Don't m-mind m-m-me," the little
man chattered. "1 ain't scared. It's
only my nerves, gosh dang them. I'll
b-b-be all right in a minute."
And Smoke watched him, doubled
over, his shoulders between his knees,
shivering and awkward, holding a
slight tension on the rope with one
hand, while with the other he hacked
and gouged holes for his heels in the ice.
"Carson," he breathed up to him,
"you're some bear, some bear."
The answering grin was ghastly and
pathetic. "I never could stand height,"
Carson confessed. "It always did get
me. Do you mind if I stop a minute
and clear my head? Then I'll make
those heel holes deeper so 1 can heave
you up."
Smoke's heart warmed. "Look here,
Carson; the thing for you to do is to
cut the rope. You can never get me
up, and there's no use both of us be
ing lost You can make it out with
your knife."
"You shut up!" was the hurt retort
"Who's running this?"
And Smoke could not help but see
that anger was a good restorative for
the other's nerves. As for himself, 11
was .. (he mffro JCije ticking strain,
lying plastered against the ice with
nothing to do but strive to stick on.
A groan and a quick cry of "Hold
on!" warned bim. With face pressed
against the ice he made a supreme
sticking effort, felt the rope slacken
and knew Carson was slipping toward
him. He did not dare look up until
he felt the rope tighten and knew the
other had again come to rest.
"Gee, that was a near go!" Carson
chattered. "I came down over a yard.
Now, you wait. I've got to dig new
holds."
Holding the few pounds of strain
necessary for Smoke with his left
hand, the little man jabbed and chop
ped at the ice with his right. Ten
minutes of this passed.
"Now, I'll tell you what I've done,"
Carson called down. "I've made heel
holds and hand holds for you along
side of me. I'm going to heave the
rope in slow and easy, nnd you Just
come along sticking and not too fast.
I'll tell you what, first of all. I'll take
you on the rope, and you worry out of
that pack. Get me?"
Smoke nodded, and with infinite care
unbuckled bis pack straps. With a
wriggle of the shoulders lie dislodged
the pack, and Carson saw it slide over
the bulge and out of sight.
"Now, I'm going to ditch mine," he
called down. "You just take It easy
aud wait."
Five minutes later the upward strug
gle began. Smoke, after drying bis
hands on the insides of his arm sleeves,
clawed Into the climb—bellied and
clung and stuck and plastered— sus
talned and helped by the pull of the
rope. Alone, he could not have ad
va need.
A third of the way up, where the
pitch was steeper and the ice less
eroded, he felt the strain on the rope
decreasing. He moved slower and
slower. Here was no place to stop and
remain. Ills most desperate effort
could uot prevent the stop, and he
could feel the down slip beginning.
"I'm going," be called up,
"So am I," was -the reply, gritted
through Carson's teeth.
"Then cast loose."
Smoke felt the rope tauten In a fu
tile effort; then the pace quickened, and
as he went past his previous lodgment
and over the bulge the last glimpse he
caught of Carson bo was turned over,
with madly moving hands and feet
striving to overcome the downward
draw.
To Smoke's surprise, as he went over
the bulge, there was no sheer fall. The
rope restrained him as lie slid down a
steeper pitch, which quickly eased un
til he came to a liait in another niche
on the verge of another bulge. Carson
was now out of sight, ensconced in the
place previously occupied by Smoke.
"Gee!" lie could hear Carson shiver.
"Gee!"
An interval of quiet followed, and
then Smoke could feel the rope agi
tated.
"What are yon doing?" he called up
"Making more l and and foot holds,"
lame the trembling answer. "You just
wait. I'll have you up here In a jiffy.
Don't mind the way 1 talk. I'm Just
excited."
"You're holding me by main
strength," Smoke argued. "Soon or
late, with the ice melting, you'll slip
Jowu after me. The thing for you to
do i3 to cut loose. Hear me! There's
no use both of us going. Get that?
You're the biggest little man hi crea
tion, but you've done your best. You
cut loose!"
"You shut up! I'm going u> rnako
holes this time deep enough to haul up
a span of horses."
Several silent minutes passed. Smoke
could hear the metallic strike and hack
of the knife, and occasionally driblets
of ice slid over the bulge and came
down to him.- Thirsty, clinging on
hand and foot, he caught the frag
ments in his mouth and melted them
to water, which he swallowed.
He heard a gasp that slid into a
groan of despair and felt a slackening
of the rope that made him claw, im
mediately the rope tightened again.
Straining his eyes In an upward look
along the steep slope, he stared a mo
ment, then saw the knife, point first,
slide over the verge of the bulge and
down upon him. He tucked his cheek
to It, shrank from the pang of cut
flesh, tucked more tightly and felt the
knife come to rest
"I'm a slob!" came the wail down
the crevasse.
"Cheer up, I've got It!" Smoke an
swered.
"Stay! Walt! I've got a lot of
string in my pocket. I'll drop it down
to you, and you send the knife up."
Smoke made no reply. He was bat
tling with a sudden rush of thought.
"Hey, you! Here comes tile string.
Tell me when you've got it."
A small pocketknlfe weighted on
the string slid down the lee. Smoke
got It, opened the larger blade by a
quick effort of his teeth and one hand
and made sure that the blade was
sharp. Then he tied the sheath knife
to the end of the string.
"nauj away!" he called.
With strained eyes he saw the up
ward progress of the knife. But he
saw more—a little man, afraid and In
domitable, who shivered nnd chattered,
