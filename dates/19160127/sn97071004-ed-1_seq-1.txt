PORTLAND RECTOR
CALLS fOR DEFENSE
Dr. Morrison, Episcopalian, Das
No Use for Pacificist
CHRIST'S NON-RESISTANCE IS DENIED
Mother Who Would Keep Her Sons
' From Enlisting Declared to Be
"Disgrace to Nation."
The finger of shame waa pointed
from the puplt of the Portland Trinity
Episcopal church Sunday morning at
the mother whose love for her son
rises above that for her nation
Tbs mothers and "peace at any
price" advocates were denounced as a
'disgrace to the nation," and an ap
peal, based on the teachings of Christ,
for proper national armaments, was
sent forth by Dr. A. A. Morrison, rec
tor of that church, in what waa con
sidered perhaps the strongest sermon
in defense of preparedness ever deliv
ered from any pulpit in Portland.
After the sermon members of the
congregation rushed forward to con
gratulate the pastor.
"I cannot understand these individ
uals who cry even from the pulpits
peace at any price,' " he told them.
'I wonder what they would do, if
some one in the night should by force
steal away their wife and daughter.
Would tbey run after them with their
theory of loveT Of course not."
The teaching of Christ, be declared
In answer to those peace advocates
who bsae their theories on the Bible,
Is not against preparedness. And he
cited Christ's scourging of the money
changers in the temple, hia chastise
ment of the Scribes and Pharisees and
his advice to sacrifice one's life for a
friend. '. .-
"A misapprehension exists," he de
clared, "over the phrase called
'Christian teaching.' There are those
advocating peace under any and all
circumstances who assert that Jesus
Uught a doctrine of non-resistance; a
doctrine which would utterly abrogate
the use of force in education or as a
defense against evil-doers. Many per
sons believe Christ advocated thla, but
I say he did no such thing."
Avalanche of Snow and Earth .
Kits Great Northern Train; 8 Dead
Seattle Two cars of westbound
Great Northern Cascade Limited train
were swept from the track by an aval
anche near Corea station Saturday
morning-, and were hurled 80 feet
down the mountain side, causing death
to four passengers, and four missing.
Fifteen passengers were injured, none
seriously except Earl Smith, of Spo
kane, a small boy.
The train was standing on the track
near Corea, on the west slope of the
Cascade mountains, when the aval
anche struck it near the middle, a day
coach and the diner going over the
bank, while a sleeper behind them was
toppled over on its side, where it hung
in its perilous position over the bank,
but waa not taken down.
The dining car stopped when about
half way down the slope and caught
fire, being destroyed there.
The scene of the accident ia but a
few miles east of the scene of a sim
ilar disaster of February 28, 1910,
when two Great Northern trains were
struck by snowslides and nearly all the
persona on the trains perished.
Villa Sends Messenger to Deny
Implication in Killing of Americans
El Paso, Tex. Tedeore Prieto, who
saya he is a major in the Villa army,
appeared Monday and declared that he
had been sent in disguise to the border
by Gen. Villa to say that Villa had
nohting to do with the massacre of 18
foreigners at Santa Ysabel January
10.
"Villa did not know of the tragedy
for; daya afterward," said Prieto.
'He instructed me to say that he will
execute the men responsible, even if
they prove to be his own men, if they
are caught."

PRESIDENT WILSON TO CAMPAIGN
.TOR HIS PREPAREDNESS PROGRAM
Washington, D. C President Wil-
sori.ls plsnning to sssume personal
leadership In the fight for a stronger
army and navy. So many reports
have reached bim of confusion over the
issue before congress and of the uncer
tainty of the outcome, that he haa de
termined not only to go before the
country in public address, but to con
fer further on the subject with leaders
of the senate and bouse.
Representative Hay and Represent
ative Padgett, chairmen of the house
military and naval committees, re
spectively, have informed Mr. Wilson
that it will be from two weeks to a
month before the committees will be
resdy to report any army and navy
appropriation bills. While this work
is going on he proposes to do his ut
most to solidify sentiment among the
people and members of congress in
favor of the plana drawn up by the
war and navy departments.

him as being undeterred by the open
oppositin of former Secretary Bryan
and other pacificists, and by differ
ences among advocates of national de
fense over the plana adopted. He is

the program prepared by Secretaries
Daniels and Garrison is the best which
can be offered at this time.

necessary the President may change

Socialist Representative Is Loyal
But Speaks Against Preparedness
Washington, D. C Every Socialist
in the United States would defend this
country if attacked by a foreign foe,
Representative London, the only So
cialist in congress, told the house
Wednesday in an address against pre
paredness.
The house shouted down attempts to
limit London's time and spurred him
on with question. His declaration
that the Socialists would fight was
greeted with thunderous applaues.
Representative O'Shaughnessy, of
Rhode Island, demanded of London
what would be the attitude of the So
cialists in case the American flag was
attacked.
"I desire to Bay that if the people of
the United States were attacked every
Socialist would fight," London said.
"What is the distinction between
the flag and the people?" a dozen Rep
resentatives immediately asked, in as
many different ways, while London
smiled and fenced the question.
"The people throb with life." he
said, "while a flag is an emblem only.
Any lunatic from an insane asylum can
attack the flag and trample on it, but
it is a vastly different thing for an at
tack to be made on the people."
Rescuers at Ice Prison.
Roseburg, Or. After a two days'
trip through snow and ranging from
three to eight feet deep the rescue
party which left here Monday arrived
at the tent cabin of A. J. McCallister
and family on the Coast mountains late
Wednesday. Although practically iso
lated on account of the recent storm,
the McCallister family had sufficient
fuel and food to last them for several
days. The rescue party was obliged to
make most of the trip on snowshoes.

HEADS OPUY AND
NAVY APPROVE PLAN
Major-Generals Bliss and Scott
Support Secretary Garrison.
UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IS IDEAL
Advocates Organization of Reserve
Corps of Officers and 500,000
Additional Trained Men.
Washington, D. C Unqualified sup
pott waa given Secretary Garrison's
army plan before the senate military
committee by Major General Scott and
Major General Bliss, respectively chief
and assistant chief of staff of the
army. Both amplified statements
made on the subject last week before
the bouse committee.
General Scott decarled the plan
would save at least five months' time
in building up an army of defense in a
war emergency. He advocated im
mediate organization of a reserve
corps of officers actually commissioned
and assigned to the posts they would
take in time of war. General Scott
also urged that a quartermaster's re
serve corps of enlisted men be formed
to include mechanics of all kinds, tel
egraphers, radio operators, motor ve
hicle drivers and experts, teamsters,
railway men and the like. A repre
sentative of the American Legion, he
said, had told him recently thatJIS.OOO
men of this sort had been listed by the
organization who were willing to en
list in such a corps.
Both of the generals expressed the
opinion that universal military service
waa the only "ideal democratic" meth
od of building an army,, but . thought
the country would not tolerate the pro
posal now. General Bliss said it was
only talked of by army officers aa an
academic question on this account.
Discussing the details of the various
bills under consideraion. General Bliss
said that the measure proposed by the
War department was the, only one
which appeared satisfactory or which
seemed to contemplate a definite pol
icy. The War college division of the
General Staff, he said, has fixed 600,-
000 men, -more or less trained, as the
irreducible minimum necessary for the
country's safety in the first shock of
war. .
The proposal to increase the regular
army to 250,000 as suggested in Sen
ator Chamberlain's tentative bill, he
added, was wholly inadequate by it
self. Moreover, he added, it was im
possible to recruit a larger force than
140,000 men, as proposed by Secre
tary Garrison for the regular army,
without increasing pay or otherwise
giving added inducement. He read a
report from the adjutant general de
claring that it would be impossible to
recuit even 200,000 men in peace
times and that the arevage maximum
force that could be maintained was
only 122,000.
Five Negroes Are Hanged from
Limbs of One Tree in Georgia
Sylvester, Ga. The death of five
negroes, whose bullet-riddled bodies
were found early Saturday morning
hanging from a tree near Starkville,
Ga., was held in a coroner's verdict to
have been due to "strangulation and
gunshot wounds at the hands of un
known parties." There waa no indica
tion that any further investigation
would be conducted.
The negroes, accused of implication
in the killing of Sheriff Moreland at
Starkville, were taken from the jail
here late Friday by a small party of
men who gained access to the cells
through a well-planned ruse and
whisked the five prisoners away in
automobiles. They persuaded the
sheriff to open the jail doors by asking
permission to place a negro they
brought with them in a cell for safe
keeping. The negro disappeared while the
sheriff was being overpowered and
efforts to locate him or learn his ident
ity have been fruitless.
Blood Transfusion Urged.
Chicago Confident that blood trans
fusion will save the lives of many if
applied in cases of gas poisoning. Cor
oner Hoffman sent a letter to every
hospital in Chicago giving instructions
as to .the preservation of blood to be
used in life-saving work. He said he
would provide blood containers for any
hospital. Experiments indicate that
blood can be safely kept 80 days. There
have been 8423 deaths from asphyxia
tion in Chicago in the last 11 years. - i
NEW PUN Of TESTING
PUPILS TO BE TRIED IN
EIGHTH GRADE EXAMS.
In the May and June Eighth grade
examinations a new plan will be tried
In testing the pupils In the subjects of
U. S. History and Civil Government,
according to a atatement lasued by
State Superintendent of Public In
struction J. A. Churchill. During the
examination the pupils will be allowed
to refer to their text books, but the
questions will be so framed as to 'test
the ability of the pupil in expressing
what he has learned in clear, concise,
language. The advantages of such a
plan are, that it permits the teachers
to emphasize the historical events
which she considers most important;
it gives the trained teacher greater
freedom, so that ahe can do a much
higher quality of work than simply
helping the pupils to "cram" for an
examination; It frees the teacher and
the pupils from so teaching and study
ing as to make the examination the
end; it tends to give the pupils power
of expression and eliminates the mem
orizing of unimportant dates and facta,
"There is always danger," said. Su
perintendent Churchill, "of the ex
amination system developing a ques
tion and answer method of teaching.
Any plan whereby the examination be
comes the end is unpedagogical, and
the examination usually deteriorates
into a memory test. With this new
plan, if the teacher will adopt it for
the pupils' monthly tests, they will
learn by the close of the year how to
use the text aa merely a reference
work in writing their final papers. The
questions will be so worded that it will
be impossible for the pupil to copy any
amonut from the text book, but he will
find help by turning to it to refresh
his memory on some point that has es
caped him just for the moment. When
writing an examinatoin a pupil often
finds that he cannot recall the answer
to a question. He is then liable to be
come so nervous and frightened that
be will fail in the entire examination.
This is really the common-sense way to
prepare a pupil for his work in the
every day world, for if a man has o
write an article or prepare a paper on
any subject, he does not attempt to
depend upon his memory for the proof
which he wishes to use from various
scources to substantiate his state
ments; rather, he has on hia table a
number of reference works dealing
with the subject upon which he is
writing.
The eighth grade examinations, to a
very large exent, set the standard of
teaching, and I am very confident that
this new plan will strengthen the work
in the eighth grade and give the pupil
much more power and confidence than
he gains from the memory tests. If
his class standing has been high dur
ing the year and his English class
work has been below par, the open
book will be of no help to him during
the short hour of his examination."
FARMERS' ANDHOME-MAKEfiS'
SHORT COK IN SESSION
Corvallis Many parts of Oregon are
represented in the gathering of farm
ers and homemakera at the Agricultur
al college for the annual short course
work which beagn last week. Un
like the work of Farmers' week the
short course work is carried on with
the regular college work, and it ex
tends over a period of four weeks.
Much of the work is given as class and
personal instruction through lectures,
demonstrations and laboratory exer
cises. In many instances the training
is made a personal matter, specialists
of the college staff directing the work
of individuals in their chosen courses.
Eight courses are offered in fields
and crops, eight in farming combined
with raising livestock and dairying,
eleven in creamery work and dairying,
five in garment making and house
keeping,, five in food preparation, ten
in orcharding, and two in wood and
metal shop work.
In each of these selections can be
made and more or less optional work
taken, as in orcharding, where use can
be made of the special facilities
offered by the college in pruning or
spraying or other specialty. By com
pleting the prescribed work in any of
the foregoing courses, students may
receive a certificate setting forth the
work accomplished. Some of the
courses are progressive and require a
minimum of work in specified subjects
as an entrance requirement. .
In addition to the work of the fore
going courses a series of lectures on
commercial and business subjects, on
poultry, history, economics, zoology,
chemistry, farm accounting, and high
way construction, will be given
throughout the four weeks. For fur
ther information send for complete
program to O. A. C, Corvallis, Ore. .
