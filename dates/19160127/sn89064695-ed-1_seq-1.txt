SUBSCRIPTION: S1.S0 PER YEAR III ADVANCL
Sells' Report On White
Earth Land-Fraud
Gases.
In his annual report the com
missioner of Indian affairs has this
to say relative to the land suits of
this reservation:
"The act of June 21, 1906'(34
Stat. L., 325353), permitted only
adult mixed-bloods of the White
Earth Reservation, Minn., to alien
ate their allotments. In 1909 it
was learned that gross frauds had
been and were being perpetrated
mainly by whiteson full-blood
allottees holding restricted lands,
and that the foods of minor mixed
bloods were being purchased, en
cumbered, and denuded of tim-
ber."
"Through the Department of
Justice suits were instituted to
cancel and set aside these fraudu
lenVcu^iKtyanceSi and as a basis
for investigating these -fraud- cases
a roll of 5,093 allottees of the res
ervation was prepared, showing
the degree of Indian blood. On
June 8, 1914, the Supreme Court,
in the case of the United States
vs. First National Bank (234 U. S
245), held that the term "mixed
blood" found in the act of June
21, 1906, meant that any identifi
able quantum of blood other than
Indian blood relieves the allot
ments of the adult Chippewas from
all restricticns upon alienation."
''Since inaugurating this work
1,29 suits, have been instituted by
the Government to recover, ap
proximately, 103,920 acres of land
alleged to have been illegally alien
ated, and for accounting by vari
ous defendants for timber cut and
removed therefrom. Three bills
have bee/j filed in equity to clear
title to 288 alotments, aggregating
23,040 acres, and 170 cases of al
leged fraudulent conveyance have
been prepared and reported for
suit. Decrees and orders in favor
of the United States were obtained
in 45 cases, by which 4,906.82
acres were recovered to the In
dians $700 paid in fines and $13,
000 paid for land sold, represent
ing a total of $86,602 30. There
was collected from timber trespass
and depredations $45,000 7 claims
were settled out of court, repre
senting$29,333.86 22 quitclaim
deeds were obtained, clearing title
to 1,760 acres and $25,000 was
collected as additional compensa
tion for minors' lands. The not
result is that there has been col
lected in cash, recovered in land
values, and for settlements and
trespass, more than $200,000."
"Four suits have also been in
stituted by the Government to re
strain the county officials of Beck
er, Mahnomen, and Clearwater
Counties, in which the White
Earth Reservation is located, from
wrongfully taxing trust lands still
held by allottees, whether full
blood or mixed. These tax case?
involve lands aggregating 69,204.-
11 acres."
According to the foregoing re
port, it would be inferred that the
BurchDaniels forces have been
accomplishing what no doubt the
government thought they would
and should accomplish when sent
out here, but as. a matter of fact
the report is misleading and no
doubt was written for the purpose
of justifying the long drawn out
work of the BurchDaniels forces.
Aside from the criminal suits
for which L. S. "Waller and M. J.
Kolb were prosecuted, the forces
have accomplished practically noth
ing.
Some reputable business and
professional men rather than de
fend some suits, regarding which
they had some doubts, gave quit
claim deeds for the lands involved
to the government.
The trespass cases were those
where the timber agents of this
reservation, who received compen
sation for their employment from
the tribal funds of the Chippewas
notwithstanding that they looked
atter the trespass on individual al
lotments, settled themselves,
through the Agency office here.
It is learned that twelve suits
during the past seven years have
been tried and that the govern
ment has won only three of these
that mainly technical questions
have been raised by the govern
ment force and tried which has
taken more time to try than all
the cases, had they been tried
properly, would have taken where
the questions of fact are involved.
It may possibly be true that the
Burch and Daniels forces, includ
ing the trespass which was collect
ed through the efforts of the timber
agents, have colle^eJ^Q0*Q00,
but it basest the government and
tntftJhrppewas between three* and
four hundred thousand dollars to
do this, so that it would have been
more expedient and better for all
concerned had the government
used the money to pay the allot
tees for the lands and timber they
sold under their own affidavits that
they were adult mixed-blood allot
tees. It is not the allottees that
are finding fault, except a few
warehousers with the sales of their
allotments, and no self-respecting
allottee is in sympathy with thejp
efforts of Mr. Daniels to keep him
self indefinitely in the government
service by using them as stool
pigeons to do so.
"Let My People Go,"
"HAS THE INDIAN NO RIGHTS?"
(By Dr. Carlos Montezuma.)
Under the above caption Doctor
Carlos Montezuma made a strong
appeal before the conference of
The Society of American Indians,
held at Lawrence, Kansas, last
fall, and from his address we quote
in part some of his statements
which arc as follows:
"The Society of American In
dims has met and met. This com
ing together every year has
been the mere routine of shaking
hand", appointing committees,
listening to papers, hearing discus
sions, passing a few resolutions,
electing officers, then re-organiz
ing- and that has been the extent
of our outlook and usefulness for
our race. Our placing too much
faith and confidence in the Indian
Bureau has caused us to evade the
vital, the most important and fun
damental object of our Society.
Mohonk Conferences, Indian
Rights Association, Indian Friends
and other similar organizations
have also evaded the vital, para
mount issue if they touched on it,
they did it in the form of a whis-
per/"

not be educated they were some
what like human beings, but not
quite within the line of human
rights the only hope was to let
the bullets do the work, cover up
the bloody deeds and say no more
God and humanity were forgot-
ten."
"At that hour, when the Indians
were made 'good Indians*, as a
lightening from the clear sky, oat
from the frontier, among Indian
fighting soldiers, a voice came:
"Stay the sword, the Indian is a
man.' That voice was no less than
Lieut. R. H. Pratt, now our most
beloved and honored benefactor.
Brig. General."
"There comes a time in human
events when abandonment of racial
responsibilities become very op
pressive, unbearable, intolerable,
and there seems to be no hope
then man must exert himself,
speak* and act."
"The status of our people is not
on the square, for that reason,
Brothers, that time has come to
our race. The Society of Ameri
can Indians is not free."
"We are wards, we are not freeI
In a free country we are not free
our heritage is freedom, but we
are not free. Wake up, Indians,
all over America!"
"We are hoodwinked, duped
more and more every year we are
made to feel that we are free when
we are not. We are chained hand
and foot, we stand helpless, inno
cently waiting for the fulfillment
of promises that will never be ful
filled, in the overwhelming great
ocean of civilization.'? A
"Some well-menning people feel
very bad over' thia matter of tak
ing away the support of the In
dians. They pass their hands over
their foreheads, take a long sigh,
sadly look into space and wonder
how we are going to free the In
dians. And what will become of
the poor Indians then? This go-*
ii.g here and there seeking to find
a solution to the Indian problem
is all nonsense. It has been a prob
lem so long that it has become a
problem."
Gen. Pratt's words are true,
that 'the Indian is no problem.' It
is all in our mind. To free the In
dian is to free the Indian. There
is nothing complicated about that.
It is so simple that we cannot be
lieveit."
"The question of abolishing the
Indian Bureau is not a new idea.
Eleven years ago the progress of
the Indian race had reached that
stage of preparation that enables
them to be independent of Gov
ernment supervision and to be told
to go their own way and be their
own self-supporters."
"Gen. Pratt sounded the key note
when he said: 'Better, far better
for the Indians had there never
been a Bureau. Then self-preser
vation would have led the individ
ual Indian to find his true place,
and his real emancipation would
have been speedily consumated."
"When Ger$ Pratt uttered these
words, he thought that the country
and the President were with him
in heart and soul for the better
ment of the Indians, as in the past.
Not so, humiliatingly he was made
to realize that there was someone
higher than he, someone to be con
sidered, someone to be reckoned
with'. He found himself relieved
from the great institution he had
founded and cherished, and where
he had hoped to see bis last days.
He had 3aid much. He was in the
Indian service under the Bureau
and bis head was cut off1904."
"With regret the writer must
mention the fact that the Muhonk
Conference, Indian Rights Asso
ciation, and National Indian Asso
ciation were silent and dumb. Not
&*&
them. Shame upon them! If
they were true and loyal friends
of the Indians, such would not
have occurred."
Government:--Say, Sitting Bull.
I know you are a good fellow, but
you are as a child in looking after
your business, you are easily
cheated and robbed. I know it
because I have done it myself.
Now, my good friend Sitting Bull,
I will tell you what to do. You
give everything over to me and I
wilt do everything for you."
4 That is about how we came to
be wards of thegovernment. They
and we as their children, have paid
dearly in every way to have the
United States Government in
charge of us as wards."
"Today the Indian Bureau is
founded on a wrong basis. It is
un-American. It is pursuing un
natural methods to reap natural
results. Being unnatural, it has
come to be a heavy burden instead
of a help to the Indians. It is
dominated by the Indian Service
Regulations, thus dominatipg the
Indians and perpetuating itself. It
has swerved from its noble course.
It has derailed the Indian from
the main road that other races
travel. It has gone into commer
cial business it is methods and
methods and promotions."
"The original grand, noble and
ideal object of the Indian Bureau
was to aid and protect the Indian
and prepare him to emerge from
his wigwam into civilization, and
it has been a total failure."
The humane and sentimental
pmotj#r1i*s not been practical and
b'd^'*H Indian a great deal
of harm before Che world. It baa
been a blind a pretention that you
are doing something. It is never
ceasing, never ending."
"Indian employees in the In
dian Service are working against
the freedom of their race."
"Truth hurts, but it is never
wrong, and in the long run it con
quers. The Indian Bureau is the
only obstacle that stands in the
way, that hinders our people's
freedom. It seems so strange, so
incredible and so unheard of, that
we Indians must fight and kill the
very organ that was organized to
free us, in order to free our
selves."
"It is appalling and inexplicable
that the pale-faces have taken all
the Indian's propertythe conti
nent of Americawhich is all he
had in the world. The Indian asks
for public school, college and uni
versity education for his children.
To refuse such a noble request
would be as cruel as to give a
stone when he asks for bread.
Will the Department defray the
expenses of any college or univer
sity Indian students? The Indian
Bureau's motto seems to be,
"Eighth grade and no more." And
therefore we may assume that the
Indian Department does not want
the Indian educated. It may be
wise, and is afraid that they will
make too many lawyers who will
fight it to a finish. It may be
that the Indian Bureau fears some
thing may happen from the In
dian's knowledge of doing some
thing."

Appointed.
PROPOSITION BY REPRESENTATIVE
HEYDEN.
Representative Heyden, of the
House Indian committee, has sug
gested that a commission be ap
pointed by an act of Congress to
classify the Chippewas of Minne
sota into competent and non com
petent Indians that immediately
following the conclusion of this
work to give the competent In
dians their distributive share of
tribal funds and property, and
place them upon their own re
sources. But as to the incompe
tents, the government will con
tinue to handle their matters.
This plan should meet with the
approval of all the Chippewas and
no sentimental reasons, nor selfish
motives should interfere with the
proposition.
It is proposed to pay the com
mission from tribal funds for their
services, and to require them to
complete their work in six months.
THE TOMAHAWK suggests that
the proposed classification could
not be completed within six mouths
satisfactorily, and for this reason
