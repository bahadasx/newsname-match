SENATE PARLIAMENTARIANS DE
CLARE MEASURE IS KILLED BY
A RULING OF THE SPEAKER
OF HOUSE.
Oklahoma City, Jan. 2.',. Governor
Williams said Wednesday afternoon
that he would sign th ant i-gambling :
biil as it came to him, whether the I
house had formally attached t he i
emergency to the senate amendments1
or not. He said he could see no1
constitutional objection to the manner
of passage. He would not go behind I
the signatures of the presiding of-'
Peers of both houses, he said.
The house endangered the validity
of the new anti-gambling law Wednos-
day by failing to attach the enter-;
gency clause to the senate amend-!
ments, the strongest feature of the I
bill. A separate two-thirds vote is1
required to attach this clause, mak
ing bills immediately effective.
Speaker McCrory, who opposed the
senate amendments, backed by Speak-,
er nro tern Furant. who fouaht them
bitterlv, ruled that the house having !
adopted the emergency before the bill
was sent to the senate, was not re
quired to do so as to the amendments
adopted by the senate.
When Judge J. T. Dickerson of
Fdmond appealed from MeCrory's de
cision, Purant pleaded for 'every
democrat in the house to vote against
Dicherson."
"Why, why?" asked democrats from
al! over the house.
"I can't tell you now," said Durant.l
"intimation is enough." j
McCrory was sustained, ?A to .12,
and no roll call was had on the!
emergency clause.
Claim It's Killed. j
Senate parliamentarians said the
bill had been killed by McCrory's j

HIGHLY COMPETENT DEMON
STRATOR DISCUSSED LOCAL
SITUATION. MARSHALL COUNTY
APPRECIATES HIS SERVICES.
If. Garland of Madiil, farm demon
tration auetit of Marshall county, was
in the city today en route to his home
from Oklahoma City where he had
been on official business.
Mr. Garland Is considered one of
the best demonstration ugents in tho
slate and so well Is his service looked
upon that he has received many flat
tering offers from Texas counties just
over the border.
In speaking of the work this morn
ing, Mr. Garland stated that he re
gretted that Carter county was going
to be without a demonstrator for even
a part of the year as he considered
nothing of more real value to any
county than real scientific farming.
"All wealth comes from the soil," said
Mr. Garland, "and if by the expendi
ture of a few hundred dollars by the
tax payers of the county, aided by the
appropriation from the federal govern
ment will cause a greater Increase in
the crops and a greater value of farm
lands then it looks to me as if It
would be good business policy to em
ploy one. Mr. Garland has been en
gaged in the work in Marshall county
for a number of years, and the tax
payers there would not think of part-
jing wuu ins sfioi'cs uiiuer uuy cir
cumstances. Just what action will be
tak n here, has not been decided upon
