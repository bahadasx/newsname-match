BLOCKADE POLICY
NOT TO BE MADE
Sir Edwards Grey's Speech Blasts
Hopes Of Extremists
LIMIT HAS BEEN REACHED
More Drastic Regulations Would Lose
Great Britain the Friendship of
Neutrals.
London, Jan. 26. The speeches of
Sir Edward Grey lu the house of
commons aud of the Marquis of Lans-
downe, minister without portfolio, In
the house of lords this afternoon on
the blockade policy of Great Britain
dispelled all hope .aanong those favor
ing a formal blockado of Germany
that the government would push such
action.
Foreign Secretary Grey made the
following statement:
"Through Investigation by the gov
ernment of the situation with regard
to shipments to Germany shows that
everything possible Is being done with
out causing serious troubles with
neutrals."
If, he added, there was any policy
more pleasing to neutrals than the
one at present In force, the govern
ment would be pleased to examine
and to consider it If it appeared equal
ly effective. !
In regard to the negotiations of
the United States and the intentions
of the government In, treating Ameri
ca's protests, he said: .
"We are telling the American gov
ernment in our reply to the last note
from Washington, that we are consid
ering the whole matter in consulta
tion with the French, government and
that we may consult, our , other allies.
"It y:o concedd -everything asked in
the. last note from the United States
we! will have to give up our. attempt
to stop eve.ii t contraband from .reach
ing the enemy. ' If -wc apply theprin
ciplcs of blockade exjwunded by. the
United States iii the Civil war, then
neutrals should help England. If
thoy ' say England should not be per
mitted to interfere with shipments to
Germany in accordance with these
princples, then they must depart
from neutrality."

London, Jan. 27. Hereafter French

Relief Benefit for the Jewish Suffer
ers Here.

dent Wilson that an effort bo made
by. the entire nation to raise money
for the Tellef of the Jews now starv
ing hi the war districts of Europe, a
benefit concert a ml moving picture

, The management has -contributed
thq houso at a figure which they
thijik considerably, bolow the neces
sary expense, feeling that in thin way
they, also may do their share toward
relieving the suffering,
The extent of suffering of the Jews
is hot generally known In this 'coun-
tryj bread is selling In parts of Rus
sia for a rouble and a half or seventy-
five cents which allowing for the nor
mal difference in tho purchasing val
ue of money and the scalu of wages
prevailing, Is the equivalent of a dol
lar and a half Jiere i
bread. The people are dying of hun
ger by the thousands. Thousands
are practically without clothing and
sleeping in the snow. The anguish
and torture of the mothers without
food for their children is beyond be
lief. The money will be extended in the
most practical manner by the Jewish
National Aid Society to secure food
forsthe relief. The effort to aid them
from this community is in charge ot
If, llarry Sharpe as treasurer and
Julius LCi Weichman as secretary.
Should there be any of. the ; 'pitying
