COW CREEK MURDER
STILL CAUSING TROUBLE.
Blaine County Officials Trying Their.
Best to Slip One Over on
Phillips County.
The question of which county will
have charge of the murder case on
Cow creek, is not yet settled, and
probably will not be before the first
of the month. It is claimed by the
officials of this county that the kill
ing took place in Blaine county,
the officials of Blaine county con
tend the trouble was in Phillips
county. Deputy Sheriff Brooks of
Zortman, who was called the night
of the shooting to take charge of
affairs until the tangle could be
straightened out, arrived I nthe city
* Saturday from Zortman with Bernie
O'Rilley, who is charged with the
shooting. Mr. Brooks reports a very
* strenuous time and says he held the
crowd that was at the dance there
four days waiting orders from here
or from Chinook, and when the of
ficials from Chinook did arrive they
refused to have anything to do with
the case, claiming it was a Phillips
county case. He spent four days
more bucking a, blizzard in getting
from Zortman to the railroad. He
and his party suffered considerable
from the cold.
The dead man, in charge of Liv
eryman Sauceman, arrived Ihere
Thursday night about one o'clock,
and the remains have been in the
R. V. Tucker undertaking parlors
waiting instructions from either the
0 officials of this county or those of
Blaine county. On Sunday Mr.
Tucker received word from the cor
oner at Chinook to hold a post mor
tem examination and to bury the
remains, but owing to t he frozen
0 condition of the corpse, it has been
impossible to do anything with it,
The remains will be buried in Phil
lips county regardless of where he
was killed, as he was a Phillips
county citizen.
1 We understand the officials of
Blaine county have a surveying
1 party down in the country where
Sthe trouble occurred, running the
county line to find out just which
county is to handle the case, and
that they will not be through with
the work before the first of the
month.
The story of the trouble in last
week's Enterprise was just about
correct, the only thing we did not
I mention was~ thlie fact Secrest was
abusing his wife when O'Rilley
1 tried to stop the trouble, with the
result he became tangled up in a
fight with Secrest, resulting in the
death of the latter.
THE COLD SNAP.
The Reclamation Service in this
city furnished us the following in
formation in reference to the weath
er in this locality for the past week.
The report also says that during
January the themometer has regis
tered below zero every night. In
the last three days between 14 and
15 inches of snow has fallen which
is equal to one and one-half inches
of water. The record for snowfall
before the last storm showed about
ten to twelve inches on the level.
There is more snow this winter than
any time since the winter of 1906
and prospects for a crop could not
be better than they are at this time.
Followng is the high and low
temperature for the last seven days:
January 21, 32 above, 3 below.
January 22, 1 below, 17 above.
January 23, 20 above, 10 below.
January 24, 8 below, 22 btlow.
January 25, 18 below, 21 below.
January 24, 8 below, 22 below.
January 26, 11 below, 21 below.
January 27, 42 below.
WOMAN'S CLUB.
The Malta Woman's club held an
important meeting at the Congrega
tional church on Saturday afternoon
the hostesses being Mrs. Callicotte,
Miss MacArthur and Miss Ayer.
Several guests were also present.
The location of a club house was
discussed, and the arrival of new
books for the Malta Public library
wes announced. Two new members
were added to the club roster, Mrs.
W. G. Schneider and Mrs. Owen
McKone.
The club voted to form a Sun
shine committee for carrying on
charitable work, the members to be
appointed later. The members en
tertaining on Feb. 19th are to be
Mrs. Sheppleman, Mrs. Casedy and
Mrs. Shaw.
The program was on the timely
subject of "Peace," and spirited dis
cussion ensued. Mrs. Brockway
gave a review of the entire peace
movement; Mrs. Flint gave a fine
talk on the education of youth in
the ideals of peace; Mrs. G. F.
Thompson discussed ignorance as
the undelying cause of war, and
Mrs. Kilduff took true patriotism
as the basis of her discourse.
Fine refreshments were served at
the close of the meeting.
As the Malta club will entertain
the Saco club in this city next Sat
urday plans for their entertainment
were perfected. The two clubs will
spend the morning in the pleasant
home of Mrs. Kilduff in a social ses
sion, and will be served with an el
rborate one o'clock luncheon in the
Orpheum hall, served by the, ladies
of the Congregational church.
A finely aranged musical pro
gram will be given by the Saco
ladies in the afternoon, followed by
another social session.
These exchange visits between
cluhs are most enjoyable, and assist
in their cooperation in various kinds
of club work.

amination for Phillips county will

SCHOOL NOTES.
The steriopticon will be tried out
next Friday evening, Jan. 28th, at
the old school house. Through the
kindness of the Keystone View Co.
a serices of slides, picturing the
Panama Canal, will be shown. To
defray expense charges a nominal
admission fee of 5 cents for children
and 15 cents for adults will be col
lected from those in attendance.
Children of the fifth, sixth and sev
enth grades are especially urged to
attend. Please remember the date,
Friday, Jan. 25th, at 7:30.
Cold weather and snow play
havoc with attendance. So long as
bad weather lasts all who wish
should bring lunches and stay all
day at school.
In the state examinations last
week all but four of the eightl;,
grade passed in physiology. In spell
ing 12 wrote but only 5 passed. The
seventh grade geography examina
tion was quite satisfactory. Al
though only about half way through
the year's work, about one-half got
passing grades.
The boys of the high school wish
to extend their thanks to those who
so generously patronized the Jubilee
quartette concert. Not a great
deal was gained financially, yet the
presentation of a high class attrac
tion was some recompense in itself.
Plans will he made for other enter
tainments in the future.
There was no school in two of the
rooms one day the first of the week
on account of the cold weather. It
was impossible to warm the rooms
so the little folks could b, comfort
able.
