. by hundreds who were hurrying to
work along the street and on the
elevated railroad.
Pullman left a number of letters
addreiiod to newspapers, to member
of his family nntl others which showed
that there had for a long time been
much bitter feeling between Pullman
on the one hand and the murdered
wife and daughter on tho other. No
, hint of this was given to tho detec
tives Investigating the murder until
Pullmun was dead, when relatives ad
mitted, Hint his relations with a
woman had caused many angry

WILSON TELLS 7Q0 MINISTERS
President Declares Every Nation
Should Be Allowed to Work Out
Its Own Destiny and Says That
Is His Policy in Mexico.
SUFFRAGISTS BESIEGE HIM
AND FORCE HIM TO TALK
President Wilson's first speech in his campaign for military pre.
paredness unexpectedly developed into an address on peace. In AeoMui
Hall at noon to-day 700 ministers of many denominations assemfcfad tc
ceive the President and trrurge him to labor in the cayse of peace A
atmcitreiof. rellgloAi'QrcH.peTmeated, the place, x great. orps
rolled out solemn music, ministers prayed for him and praised him In
speeches, but so surcharged were they with Intensity of feeling that (Ima
and again they broke out with applause In the midst of a passional
prayer for peace uttered by Rev. Father Martin of St. Patrick's Cathedral.
Their' fervor and their pledges of loyalty and fealty to him made Sir,
Wilson flush with emotion. In response he went beyond his prepared
reply and 'spoke to the ministers for nearly half an hour while they cheered
and applauded every word, every syllable bearing on peace.
"You have paid mo a very great
honpr," said the President, speaking
with unwonted earnestness of feeling.
"Prom my heart I appreciate It. I
feel that you havo unduly honored
me as a man. (
"In my efforts for peace I havo
been conscious of constantly repre
senting tha spirit of America und
no provlods convictions of my
own. It has been hard to bold tho
balance where so many passions are
Involved, but I believe that the people
of America are striving to hold the
balance even,
WANTS EVERY NATION TO
WORK OUT IT8 OWN DESTINY.
"I can llnd no other foundnUon for
pcaco than that laid in Justice with
out aggression. The greatest force
in the world is character. America,
has always stood resolutely and ab
oolutcly for the right of overy nation
to determine Its own destiny and its
own attitude toward its own affairs.
I am so much of a disciple to that doc
trine that I am committed to take that
atUtude in dealing will our distressed
neighbor to tho south (Mexico).
"Tho only thing America resents is
to have her life and her freedom In
terfered with. I nover have found au
diences responding to aggression, but
they lnstanUy respond to overy ox
pressed Idea of Justice, of litxirty and
of freedom. These, ato tho only things
that stir her passion.
"There Is further foundation for
peace, and thut Is in our Internal
attltudo toward each other. America
him been hospltublo to an unprece
dented degree toward all nations, all
races and all creeds. Bo she has
created In tills process of uniting and
amalgamating them all a problem of
making a dispiriting thing into har
mony. "I'cuce In Amerlra depends on the
attitude of tho different elements
uhich make, up the nation.
"I have been deeply disturbed over
evidence In recent days of recrudes
cence of religious anliiKonlsiu In this
country. This Is a very dangerous
thing, which uuts at the very mot of
tho American spirit. If men do not
love one another they cannot love
peace. If Uiey are intolerant toward
one anolhci they will be Intolerant
Inward ptaue. Live und let live Is a
huuiely i xpresiion, but 11 expresses
what our aitltudu should be,
"i'ce doe not moan inaction,
CONSISTENT
SELF - RESPECT,
There may be infinite, almost violent
activity. Peace dwells after all ia th
character and tha heart and that 1
whoro pcaco Is rooted In this blessed
country of ours.
"Tho only placo whero danger lie
Is In those things which aro atlll
deeper In our hoarts, tho things w
love nnd revere. Let no man drop flr
there. Peace Is inconsistent with th
loss of self-ruspcct or tho abandon
ment of principle. These things, 1
prny God, may never bo challenged.
"Wo believe in peace, but wo !q
believe in Justice, liberty and fair,
ncss. These are very rosponsiblo dayi
nnd In this tense atmosphere only
truth should be uttered. We are all
kith and kin In thn hulldlng up of a
family which wilt set an example tt,
the world."
PRAYER OF PRIE8T WAS MUCH
LIKE A 8PEECH.
The meeting of ministers was pre
sided over by Rev. Kdward Young
pastor of the Bedford Congregational
Church, Brooklyn. Father Martin o
Ht. Patrick's Cathedral made an open.
Ing prayer that was moro of a speect
than an Invocation. Ho said that bj
authority of Cardinal Parley he ha
come to the mooting to utter th
sentiments of thu church.
"We are hoart and soul with every
movement for the preservation oi'
ptuicr," he said. ".Vow as nover be.
foro we need a strong mind and a
powerful hand to guido us, and w
bolleve wo have such a hand amf

clear his mind to bring us proteotei)
trf the true peace, the true neutrality
which requires prudence, calmnest
and Justice and courugo not to b.
led away by tho clamor of tho dem
agoRue. Mny Clod bless him am
strengthen him."
Time and again, In tho midst of tha
prayer, tho ministers forgot thelt
bowed heaihi and broke into hand,
clapping minglod with cries of "Amen
and "(Jod ble&s him" and "God guld?
