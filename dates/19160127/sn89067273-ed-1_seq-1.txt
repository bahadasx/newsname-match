THRIFT DAY.
It's
One
Which
of the New Days
Is Coming In.
Thrift Day, February 3rd, is uni
que as a holiday, in that its proper
observance 1b a vastly different and
far more beneficial one to the indivi
dual than the usual celebration of the
average holiday. On this day the even
tenor of things goes on; business is
developed; and financial institutions
remain open to do their share in the
celebration. There is no cessation of
progressive activities familiar to most
holidays, and which frequently result
in reckless waste of both time and
money.
Another feature is that it is the
only holiday not confined to any race
religion or class. In its final develop
ment it is neither national, sectional,
rellgiohal or factional, but can be cele
brated by all humanity, to the ulti
mate and lasting benefit of individu
als, communities, nations and the
world.
The celebration of Thrift Day lies
in the faithful performance by each
Individual of some thrifty action on
that day. The very simplicity of the
idea will go a long way towards its
successful .development, and this de
velopment will mean a mighty step
forward to better conditions for every
body.' .
For this reason, leaders in all fields
of activity, particularly financial in
stitutions, are co-operating to make
memorable the first annual obser-
I Tance ' Thrift Day this year, so that
there will be a fitting standard to be
followed on the Thrift Days to come.

HEATS HANNIBAL.
Hardin GrmnaNiuni Crow do
Big Demonstration The Victory.
By Frank Houston.
A free goal in the last few seconds
of the Hannibal- McMillan game Sat
urday night brought the home boys'
score up to where it quadrupled the
number of points made by Hannibal.
The final score was 60-15. Though
one-sided, the game was 'a Bnappy
and Interesting scrap. The Bull-dogs
had the Hannibal aggregation bested
at all times and kept the ball In Mc
Mllin territory during most of the
game. Our fast team work kept Han
nibal at our mercy.
"Johnny" Kistler and "Doc" Rodes
were McMillan's stars. "Bill" Atchi
son also played a fine game and
"Keathy" and "High" Cunlngham
as usual, put up a good fight, Kist
ler was a veritable streak of llght
Inng and his goal shooting was won
derful. Rodes was, as lithe and as
full of fight as a young panther and
was always on the job. Atchison's
work was the best he had done this
year. . His playing wa3 fast and furi
ous. Sam Locke was put in to re
place Kisler toward the last. Robert
Campbell refereed the game.
The Hardin gym was crowded with
spectators. Nearly every student In
McMillan was there and the enthusi
asm and school spirit displayed was
greater than ever before. A big
crowd of outsiders also attended the
game. This was the first experience
with basketball of a great many Mc
Millan patrons.
After the game the boys, wild with
joy over this great victory, donned
their nightshirts, and, forming a long
snake-like procession, pulled Hanni
bal's coff in, rv.. elevated on a black,
hearse, .to town and. on every corner
made the town ring with their Mc
Millan yells. After their voices were
gone and they could yell no longer,
they honored Manager Shirley
Thompson with their presence at his
Orpheam Theatre., .
The two teams celebrated the vic
tory in an entirely different way. The
visitors feasted in the company of
McMillan's fairest at Buckner's. The
Hannibal boys say this was the
most enjoyable part of their visit.
The mass meeting that preceded
the game in the afternoon was near
ly as exciting as the game Itself. Our
efforts would have made a good
showing beside the famous Kansas
mass meetings held at the University
before each Kansas game according
to some who are in position to know.
Amid a volley of revolver shots an
effigy of Hannibal fell from the top
of the stage and the meeting was on.
The sophomore class then performed
funeral ceremonies over the mangled
body. Six solemn bearers carried It In
a most realistic coffin made by mem-
1 .
bers of the manual training class
feated byMcMillan this season then
made their appearnce. First came
Hannibal pep In a drooping array
of black and close beside her plodded
sad Jefferson City pep in convict's
stripes. Bowling Green pep in a
typical Pike County outfit next made
his pitiful entrance. . Alumni . pep
wearing long white whiskers and
leaning rheumatlcally on a cane hob
bled In with Fayette's pep, dressed as
the Fayette yell leader. McMillan
pep, one of the sophomore's most
attractive cirls. all "dolled up" in
crimson and gray, wnaed the stunt
The rev? Mr. Garrett, with true
Shullenberger air, preached the ser
mon.Wlth weeping and chanting the
casket was removed, Then the make
believe mourners showed their true
chanacttas and drying false tears
came to the front of the stage and
sang a cheerful McMillan song.
The- Big Stunt of the mass meet
ing came when the pictures of the
team were thrown on the screen and
each of these famous boys made
talks. . The Hannibal men made
speeches also. McMillan closed the
meeting. The band yurnlshed music
for the occasion.
A number of Hardin girls came to
the mass meeting nd helped lots
with their pep. These same girls
held a "Beat Hannibal" mass meet
ing Friday evening at Hrdin. We're
certainly grateful to Hardin for all
the support she has given us
this year.

Profit and
Miss Maud Orita Wallace, super
visor of music in the public schools
of Mexico, has lately introduced a
unique yet pleasing way to teach
small children time and rythm. The
children are pleased to call it an or
chestra, and such it Is, for each child
has his turn at the various cymbals,
triangles, . castinets, nltingales, cuck
oos and various instruments with
which to keep time with music. When
the teacher accompanies them on the
piano their joy is complete. Some
of the boys have drums, and one
third-grade boy has put together
some springs end wires in such an
Inventive way as to have a distinctly
individual instrument. With a doz
en or more in the orchestra and the
remainder of the room singing, the
effect is quite pleasing.

Entertainment in It
Such methods as this will event
ually result in better marching
among the grade children. One of
the most difficult things to teach Is
the military "hep". It comes only
after a long period of folk dancing
and training, such as the primary
grade is now receiving.
This orchestral experiment will de
velop time and rythm to the extent
that our youngsters will do better

fire drills which should be inaugura

our schools have been adorned with
fire escapes, and the fire drill la to

The above is a suggestion for the
