ENLARGEMENT OF NAVY'S
HOSPITAL FACILITIES
. ...... . ... .... . . .-- .. .
Urged Upon ths House Naval Commit
tee as Imperative.
' "Washington, Jn." H8.- Material en
largement of the navy's hospital facili
ties was urged upon the house naval
committee as imperative by Surgeon
General Braisted. who testified today
at a hearing on the naval appropria
tion bilL He said an increase of about
1,000 men in the hospital -corps was
needed and that a new modern hospital
ship and improvements In existing
land hospitals should be authorized.
" The navy department, the surgeon
general said, already was working out
plans for a hospital ship to accommo
date 800 patients, an appropriation for
which is asked in the pending navy
toll. Both the Relief and the Solace,
the navy's only hospital ships, were
old : and inadequate, he said, but if a
new ship were authorized the Solace
might be put into shape- for use in
Pacific waters. " ,
South of Norfolk and San Francisco,
the surgeon-general explained the navy
at present has virtually no hospital
facilities. He said the hospital corps
should be enlarged from the present
1,600 to 2,700 and that 94 more sur
geons were needed.
Surgeon-General Braisted said that
he bad recently searched the country
in vain for 1,700 ounces of quinine for
the American marines at Haiti and
that when he sent abroad for the drug,
holders had wanted four dollars an
ounce .instead of the usual thirty cents.
Finally he had to borrw the quinine
from the army.

IN PROTECTIVE TARIFF.
Tells Congressman Kitchin So in Let
ter About Tariff Commission.'
Washington, Jan. 26. President
Wilson today sent a letter to Chairman
Kitchin of the house Ways and means
committee explaining why he had

commission and now was urging the
creation of such a body by congress,

his mind because "all the circum
stances of the world had changed."
Declaring that he had "no thought
whatever of a change in attitude tow
ard the so-called protection question,'
the president said the proposed com
mission would have nothing to do with
theories of policy, but would be
charged only with the duty of seek
ing facts to guide congress in legisla
tion. In another letter to Mr. Kitchin
on Monday he had set forth fully his
ideas or wnat a tariff commission
should be and urged that the ways and
means committee consider the matter

DANIELS 8AYS PRE38
8HOULD RESTRAIN ITSELF
About Pressing the Government Into
Hasty. Aotion.
New York, Jan. 26. The newspapers
of the United States "ought to be j
chary of anticipating and thus forcing
the hand of the government and press
ing it into hasty action," Josephus:
Daniels, secretary of the navy, de
clared in a letter to the Brooklyn Press
club read at a meeting of the organiza
tion held to celebrate the opening of
new quarters.
"In a time of crisis," the. secretary
wrote, "when a false step on the part
of the government might plunge the
country Into war, war which might
have been averted Dy a little prelim
inary exercise of reason, the press of
the country must perforce restarin it
self. It must- not rush into premature
publication."
Secretary Daniels saw that "this
country would perish without a free
press, but that, so far as possible,
American newspapers "ought to sup
port the foreign policy of a president,
whatever party be in power, in time of
grave international crisis."

President Wilson Has Outlined
New
Proposal to Congressman Kltohln, I
Who Has Announced He Will Sup- I

"Washington, Jan. 26. Prospects for
passage of a government ship pur
chase bill are believed to b bright I
in conferences president wiison naa
today with democrats who opposed I
such a measure last year, ; Indications I
that united support ror tne revisea
proposal eventually would be won.
Urging Members to Hasten.
The president continued during the
day to urge leading members of con
(tress to hasten action on important
legislation.. He discussed the ship bill, I
particularly with -Majority Leader
Kitchin of the house and senator
Clarke of Arkansas. Later Ttepresen
tatlve Kitchin said the bill If present
ed s outlined to him would receive
his support. Senator Clarke would not
discuss it, but some of his friends said I
they believed the measure could be I
iihvnittl in fnrm tn ne hla an I
proval. I
Simmons, chairman of the I
enate finance committee and Kepre- I
AntatlvA FStzfirmlii- chairman nf the I
house appropriations committee, were
anions' those who went to the White I
House for conferences. The president 1
made It clear that matters before
congress which the administration
hoped to see pushed ahead of every
thing else were the following:
Matter to Be Pushed Ahead.
National defense measures. . includ
ing army reorganization and Increased
naval construction.
Creation of a merchant 'marine de
signed to serve as a naval auxiliary in
time of war.
Revenue legislation. Including revi
sion of the income tax law and crea
tion of a non-partisan tariff board.
The Philippine self-government bill.
which will include a provision grant
ing independence within two to four !
years, provided satisiactory steps are
taken in the meantime to establish a
stable ' independent government .
Conservation bills for development
of water power and mineral bearing
lands.
Amonsr democratic senators who
fought the ship, bill last year, and who
hav discussed It recently with the
president, are ' Senators ' 'Bardwick,
Hitchcock, CGorman and Vardaman.
It became known today that one eve
ning last week Mr. Wilson' surprised
a congressional - party of ladies and
gentlemen by - appearing unannounced
at : Senator Clarke's hotel, wher -h
conferred for half an hour with the
Arkansas senator in a corner of the
hotel lobby.
Inclined to Oppose Government Oper
ation. r ...
Tne opposition senators have ex
pressed satisfaction over some features
of the new bill, but are inclined still
to oppose anything that might make
government operation of ships prob
able. As now proposed, the bill would
provide for government operation In
case satisfactory leases to private cor
porations could not be made.
The bill probably will be disiposed
of in the house before the prepared
ness measures are introduced there.
It is understood the president's inten
tion is to have all the differing fac
tions oi nis party satisfied with a
measure before it is made. Much time
will be saved by thus thrashing out
differences before the bill reaches the
floor.
