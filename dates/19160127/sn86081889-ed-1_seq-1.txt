THE GRIM REAPER.
Short Sketches of the Lives of Per
sons Who Dave Recently
Passed Away.
Mrs. Alexander Mayne.
Mary Hoover, wife of Alexan-
Mayne, passed away sudden
j at their home at Fort Little
ton, Wednesday evening, Janu
ary 19, 1916, aged 78 years,
months, and 15 days. The fu
neral took place Saturday after
noon, the services being conduct
ed by her pastor Rev. A. S. Lur
ing, of the M. E. church, McCon
r.ellsburg, and interment was
maJe in the cemetery at Fort
Littleton.
With the exception of having
been troubled some with neural
eia. Mrs. Mayne was in about
her usual health and Wednesday
evening was resting on a lounge
in the sitting room. Noticing a
slight call Miss Annie went to
her mother and found that she
was passing away. It is believ
ed by her physician that she died
a3 a result of an attack of neu
nalgia of the heart.
Besides her husband, Mrs.
Mayne is survived by the follow
ing children; Mrs. Minnie Buck
ley, and J. Frnk Mayne, Shelby
Iowa; George, Altoona, Pa., Tho
mas and Samuel, Duncannon, Pa
Rev. Charles. Griswold, Iowa,
and Miss Annie at home. Mrs.
Mayne has two brothers living
John Hoover at Hustontown and
Christopher, near Eurnt Cabins.
Her sons were all present at
the funeral; although, on account
of delay in travel, the funeral ser
vice3 were partly over when
Charlie and Frank reached there.
Mrs. Sarah Garland.
Mrs. Sarah Garland, widow of
Benjamin Garland late of Belfast
rnunahin fcpcawr tec at flip
u home of her son-in-law and daugh
ter bull well and Lttie Iruax on
the old Preacher "Correll place
near the Brethern church in Bel
fast township, on Tuesday even
ing, January 18, 1916, in the 72nd
year of her age. The - funeral
services conducted by Eld. J.
Calvin Garland, took place on
the following Thursday, and in
terment was made in the ceme
tery at the Sideling Hill Baptist
church.
Her death was entirely unex
pected. She went to bed a little
earlier than usually, and soon
thereafter some of her women
friends called and Mrs. Truax
told them to just step into her
room as she was just resting in
bed in an adjoining room. As
her bed was approached she
threw up her hands, and passed
away apparently without a strug
gle. The deceased was a daughter
of the late Isaac Mellott, who
year3 ago lived on Pleasant Ridge
on what is now the John Bard
farm. She was married to Ben
jamin Garland, who passed away
a few years ago, and the follow
ing children survive, namely, Liz
zie, wife of David Garland, Need
more; Jennie, widow of David
Hill, near Sharpe; Ettie, wife of
Stillwell Truax, at whose home
Mrs. Garland died; and John Gar
land and Charlie Garland, both
living in Belfast township. She
is survived by one step-daughter
Emma, wife of Mason Mellott.
Mrs. Garland was a consistent
member of the Christian church
for many years, and her first
thought in life was to be useful
to those about her, and she was
never more contented than when
able to do something to add to
the comfort of those with whom
she mingled.
Gilbert Mellott.
Gilbert Mellott died at the home
of his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Har
ry Mellott, in Ayr township,
Wednesday, January 19, 1916.
The deceased was subjeet to epi
lepsy all his life and a few days
ago was attacked by grippe, which
was the immediate cause of his
death. If he had lived until Feb
ruary 9th, he would have attained
the age of 17 years. '

CHURCH DYNAMITED.
Mormon Church in Buck Vallej Totally
Wrecked In Early Hoars of Last
Thursday Morning.
During the past forty year?,
Mormon Elders have made peri
odical trips through this section
of Pennsylvania with the purpose
of sowing the seeds of doctrine
peculiar to Mormonism, or the
Church of the Latter Day Saints,
as they prefer to be called. It
was in the beautiful little valley
in the southwestern part of Ful
ton county, that the seeds shower)
the first signs ,of germination,
which was about U5 years ago. So
delighted were the Elders at this
sign of life, that nothing was left
undone to care for the tender
plant, and to broaden their field
in that section.
At that time the field was oc
cupied by Protestant churches
the Christians, the Methodists,
the German Lutherans, the Pres
byteriansall having comfort
able houses for public worship,
and the introduction of Mormon
ism in a field already occupied,
wa3 looked upon with disfavor
by a very large number of the in
habitants of the Valley. It was
not, however, until last summer,
that it was decided that a Mor
mon church should have standing
room among the other churches
of the Valley, and the few fami
lies who by this time had become
bold enough to take a public
stand for the new faith, contrib
uted of their means, and a build
ing about 28x40 feet was begun.
It was located near the post office
of Lashley, and near the old
Grange Hall, on the road leading
from Lashley to Ilarmonia school
house. The building of the new
church progressed without inci
dent until last Thursday morning
about 1:30 o'clock, a. shock
like heavy thunder caused
windows to rattle, and its rever
berations rolled sullenly from
mountainside to mountainside,
causing the peaceful citizens to
arise in fright. With the dying
down of the distant reverbera
tions, everything was quiet and
nothing to disturb the darkness
of the night.
Those living in the immediate
neighborhood of the new church
were led to what, in the evening
was an almost completed struc
ture, and there they found that
a quantity of dynamite had been
placed so carefully, that when it
exploded, the building wa3 blown

OLT-D00R SLEEPING.
Little Talks on Health and Hjgiene by
Samuel G. Dixon, M. D., LL D.;
Commissioner of Health.
That which i3 looked upon as a
fad to-day becomes the necessity
of to-morrow. This is largely the
case with out-door sleeping.
With the beginning of the ac
tive campaign against tubercuto
sis but a few years or so ago, out
door sleeping was recommended
for those suffering from tubercu
losis and others whose general
physical condition seemed to war
rant it.
These pioneers were looked up
on by their friends and neighbors
with interest and they openly ex
pressed belief that if they sur
vived this exposure, which was
doubtful, they would soon tire of
the experiment anyhow, As
matter of fact there are a hun
dred open air sleepers to-day
where there was one a decade
ago and it is no longer limited to
those who are in i'l health.
ah wno nave tried open air
sleeping are enthusiastic about it
and they constitute an ever grow
ing group.
A sleeping porch is coming to
be looked upon as an essential
part of the home. Whole fami
lies have taken to sleeping in the
open and have been so benefited
by it that they would never con
sider anything else.
mi 1
ine proper garp to insure
warmth despite the temperature
is essential. With a warm room
for dressing accessible there is
no reason why this invigorating
and stimulating custom should
not continue to grow in popu
larity. Many men and women who of
necessity must spend their work
ing hours in-doors can obtain dur
ing their rest at night, at least a
portion of tho out-door air that
Nature intended us all to have.
Sleeping porches can be con
structed on the most modest
homes at a comparatively small
cost; and, in the majority of in
stances they can be guaranteed
to save their cost in doctor bills.
The change from sleeping in
closed warm rooms to out-door
sleeping must be brought about
gradually, giving Nature time to
meet the new conditions. The
very old or very young demand
more protection than the adult in
the prime of life.

FARMERS' MEETING.
The Institute Held at Clear Ridge Last
Week Was Much Appreciated by
That Community.
As was announced in the News,
the first sessions of the Institute
were held at Clear Ridge on
Thursday afternoon. Owing to
the unavoidable absence of the
County Chairman, Frank Ranck,
the institute was called to order
by W. R. Fields, chairman of the
local committee, who made a short
opening address, and after ap
pointing Mr. C. R. Shore to serve
as secretary of the meetings, he
introduced Mr. M. H. McCallum
one of the State workers, who
spoke on the Forms and Uses o
Lime. The speaker imparted
great deal of information in such
an easy, practical way, and an
swered a number of questions so
entirely satisfactorily that every
one present felt very greatly re
paid for the time spent in attend
ing the session.
Mr. Umholt, another of the
State workers, spoke upon the
subject of Getting Eggs and Car
ing for the Layers. Mr. Umholt
is an expert poultryman and not
only knows how to do the thing
himself, but he knows how to tel
others in such a way that they
are not afraid to try for them
selves.
Thursday evening, Mr. Umholt
discussed the subject, The Farm
er and the Farm Flock, or Possi
bilities of Poultry on the Farm.
If only people could realize what
they miss by staying at home
when there is such a feast of good
things for them free, without
even having to ask for them the
house would be so crowded that
an overflow meeting would have
to be held.
Things Worth While on the
Farm was then discussed by Mr.
McCallum, who was followed by
Mr. D. H. Watts, on Education.
At 9:30 Friday morning was ta
ken up the subject Legumes;
Their Relation to Crop Produc
tion. The next subject, The
Farmer and Good Roads was ta
ken by D. H. Watts, and Mr.
Umholt finished the session with
Failures or Mistakes in Chicken
Farming.
At 1:30 Friday afternoon Miss
Heintzman of Harrisburg was in
troduced, and spoke on Woman
Suffrage. She is a fine speaker
and her address was well receiv
ed. Another address on Progres
sive Poultry Farming by R. M,
Umholt; one, on Home Mixing of
Fertilizers by Mr. McCallum and
one on Soils and Plant Growth
by D. H. Watts, ended the Fri
day afternoon session.
Friday evening, after a Round
Table talk, Mr. D. H. Watts gave
his popular lecture on Farm Build
ings and Blunders after which
the institute adjourned sine die.
The instructors are all men
who understand their business,
and should they, perchance, come
this way again bearing similar
messages, they will meet with a
hearty receptihn from those who
heard them. Those who did not
hear them, of course, do not
know what they missed, and
where ignorance is bliss, ,tis
folly to be wise."
The attendance would have
been much better if it had not
happened to strike a period of
such unseasonable weather. Ev
erybody had the grip, and the
roads were just abominable.
The sessions were much enlivt
ened by good music furnished by
an orchestra composed by C. R.
Shore, Miss Minnie Grove, and
loyd Fleming.
The Chairman of the Commit
tee extends his thanks to those
who so generously assisted him,
and to Mrs. B. S. Winegardner
and Calvin Baker for boarding
the lecturers.
Mfcs Katie Fore had the mis-
brtune to sprain one of her an
kles last Saturday; while not a
serious accident, it will somewhat
impede her usually active loco
motion for a few days. ,
SALL'VIA SLMMARIZINGS.
The Woolly Worm Indicates That We
May Get Enough of Winter Before
the Season Ends.
Many people-in this section
base their weather predictions
on the appearance of a certain
woolly worm. Last fall there
were thousands of these woolly
worms crawling on the ground.
All of them that your scribe ob
served closely were similarly
marked, v iz., a narrow black belt
at the hep.d, a narrow white belt
in the middle, and a wide black
belt at the tail. In the parlance
of the weather prophet, the black
belt at the head indicated quite a
rough cold spell at the beginning
of the winter such as we had the
last of November and running
well through December. The
white belt in the middle indicated
a mild, warm, rainy, soft spell
such as we have had through
January, with the exception of a
sudden, sharp injection of a cold
wave which we had last Monday
and Tuesday. The wide black
belt at the tail end of the worm
tells us to look out for bleak,
rough, cold, severe wintry weatli
er during February and March.
Mrs. Bert Hann visited Mrs.
J. A. Stewart's family last Fri
day. Charles W. Schooley had a dan
gerous attack of heart disease
last Sunday, but was a little tet
ter Monday.
A. J. Sipes is busy hauling
limestone from the Big Cove for
a kiln this spring.
Mrs. Beckie Mort, nee Daniels,
formerly of Saluvia but now re
siding at North Point, is report
ed as dangerously ill of Bright's
Disease and Dropsy. Her broth
ers Mason and Oliver went to see
her last Saturday.
While during the winter, Ful
ton County people are ice-bound
much of the time, and may ex
pect to be snow-bound before
ploughing time, a correspondent
of "ye scribe" writes that truck
ers down at Miami. Florida are
planting potatoes, and have al
ready marketed thousands of bas
kets of. strawberries. A great
country, this !
The revival services at the As-
bury M. E. Church as noted in
the News last week, were con
tinued nightly during all of last
week, and Sunday and Monday
nights of this week. Sinrers are
apparently taking no interest
spiritually in the wooinga of the
Holy Spirit or the earnest calls
of the pastors or the pleadings
of friends. We fear that it will
be, as with our antediluvian
friends who scoffed at Noah's
preaching for one hundred and
twenty years; when a certain
storm came along, there was not
standing room on the tops of the
mountains and a mighty bunch
of them drowned. May God's
Spirit move mightily upon our
friends; and may the day not
come when they shall cry out in
their anguish, "The harvest is
past, the summer is ended, and
I am not saved."
Tracked The Trackers. '
During the skiff of snow a few
days ago, a constable of Belfast
township discovered that a deer
was being tracked by certain bi
peds who like the odor of stewed
venison, and he proceeded to
take the trail of the trailers near
Frank Layton's sawmill, and fol-
owed it cautiously away into tho
fastness of Town Hill, when it
became necessary for him to re
turn home. Had the constable
overtaken the trailers it mizht
have been embarrassing for them
to give a very satisfactory ex
planation of their purpose in fol-
owing the deer.
George Fegley, of Pleasant
Ridge, was in town a few hours
Monday. His brother John went
down to Waynesboro with the
sawmill mandrel to have it over
hauled preparatory to moving
mown on the John Garland tract
where they will cut out a nice lot
of lumber.
