NATIONAL THRIFT DAY
TO BE OBSERVED FEB. 3
Citizens generally in this com
munity are receiving invitations to
participate in the observance of
February 3d as Thrift Day, and to
;et aside this, a special day on
.vhich the attention of the people
.vil! be called to tho individual,
neighborhood an' national benefits
bat will flow from a more intense
:u Ovation of the) thrift habit.
The moral effect of every individ
tal not only giving thought to
inift at least once a year, but ac
ua ly practicing it, must eventually
juild up ideas of frugality and
hrifiiness that will go a long way
toward making permanent any phase
i* individual or national progress.
Those back of the excellent 'dea
would gladly exploit Thrift Day
nouthly, if not weekly, and estab
iEh its observance for pay day, but
i.l rift is not a natural instinct, being
purely a principle of conduct to be
it quired, and they hope its universal
recognition once a year must grad
jally load up to its daily practice
by everyone.
To develop thrift the individi-n
lots not have to possess superhu
man abilities. Neither extraordin
iry courage nor great intellect :s
■ssential. The one necesaary qual
ity—common sense—can be possess
?d by the humbleet laborer. Just
he application of plain common
ieuso to one's daily habits promotes
.hrlft. Its practice is not a hard
ship, nor 13 it miserliness, but it
locs involve a little self-denial in
he present that the future may be
indulged. Thrift cannot be ihought
—it must be acted. Its only secret
, g —begin, and Thrift Day, Febru
iry 3d is the opportunity.
The Rev. C. Helnes el Seattle MM
preach at the Reformed Church on
CJrover St. Sunday. The inorninfJ
lermon will be in English and ibe
itternoon in Holland.
Mrs. Jed Parrish returned Friday
after a visit in Stockton, Cal., of
two months.
M'ss Alitea Landaal and Miss
Heesie Frick will leave Friday for a
