Mexico Resolution Modified,

lutions (Special to Republican)
EL I'ASO, Texas', Jan. it!. Election
of officers and the probable place for
holding" the 1917 convention were to
day most prominent topics of discus
sion among delegates to the Ameri
can National Livestock Association,
overshadowing resolutions adopted by
the convention demanding protection
for Americans and American cattle in
terests in Mexico, a permanent tariff
commission and a tariff on meats
from foreign countries. Selection of
officers and a convention meeting
place will come before the. convention
tomorrow.
I'nder the aggressive leadership of
Gov. J. B. Kendrick, the Wyoming
delegation pressed today the claim of
Cheyenne and that city seems most
likely of selection, though Salt Lake
City is campaigning in a minor key.
General sentiment in the convention
today seemed to be that Dwight ,B.
Heard of Phoenix would be re-elected
president of the association, though he
said he was not an active candidate
for re-election. Vice president I. T.
Pryor, of San Antonio, whose name
has also been mentioned for the pres
idency, said today that he would abide
by the action of the special commit
tee on nominations. Gossip today was
that T. W. Tomlinson, of Denver,
would he re-elected secretary and
John W. Springer, also of Denver,
treasurer. There was no forecasts as
to selection of six second vice pres
idents. A report of the resolutions commit
tee was adopted by the convention
without dissent except that the res
olution on Mexico was slightly
amended.
There was a compromiso on the res
olution as to Mexico. Among some
of the members there was a strong
sentiment favorable to drastic resolu
tions against the Wilson administra
tion's policy in Mexican affairs. An
other element led by Gov. J. B. Ken
drick of Wyoming, chairman of the
resolutions commtttoe disliked any
criticism or reflection on the admin
istration. The Mexican resolution provides
that a committee of three to be sent
to Washington to lay before the pres
ident, congress and the foreign rela
tions committees information regard
ing true conditions in Mexico with
reference to life and property of
American citizens; that a further pa
trol of the border should be estab
lished until stable conditions are re
stored in Northern Mexico, and that
the committee of three shall be ap
pointed by the president of the as
sociation. In its preamble, the resolu
tion calls attention to the fact that
many American citizens engaged In
lawful occupations in Mexico have
been seized and held for ransom and
in many cases foully dealt with, .and
that the property of American citi
zens has been confiscated and de
stroyed. The resolution regarding the impor
tation of meats, recites that "after
two years'' expenses of having live
stock and meat products on the free
list, it has been demonstrated that
the consumer has not been bene
fitted by lower prices, while the gov
ernment has lost a large amount of
mm h needed revenue, and the pro
ducers of livestock in this country
have been compelled to compete witii
the chaaper land and labor of other
countries, which has had a discour
aging effect on production in this
country; therefore, be it
"Resolved, that the American Na
tional Livestock Association again re
affirms its -opposition to the placing
of our products on the free list, and
asks that in any future revision of
the tariff, a fair and reasonable im
port duty be' placed on our products.
Justly proportionate to the duty im
posed on other commodities."
This is followed by a demand that
"Congress shall without delay create
a permanent, non-partisan tariff com
mission upon which agriculture, man
ufactures, labor and other branches of
industry shall be represented and that
the commission shall have full power
to Investigate conditions, hear com
plaints and make recommendations to
congress, based upon ascertained facts,
for such changes in the tariff sched
ules as they shall deem to be fair
and equitable." '
Another resolution recites that, this
country has suffered from a most
serious outbreak of foot and mouth
disease, protests against the impor
tation of dressed meats, hides, wool
and other animal products from coun
tries where dangerous infectious dis-
eases of animals exist, and condemns!
me policy mat invites sucn disasters
as the recent foot and mouth epidemic
as the rankest economic folly.
The resolutions condemn as "detri
mental to the live interests of the
United States," bills known as house
bill 77C and house resolution Iftfi. to

KL. I'ASO, Jan. 26. Confirmation was lacking tonight of a report from
western Chihuahua that the bodies of Frank Woods and l'.enjamin Snell,
American cowboys, had been found west of Cusihuiriaehic. The cowboys
were last heard of a week ago when they were reported as traveling toward

being wounded by bandits. With the -cowboys at the time were Hoy and John
Kramer, sons of Dr. Kramer.

DOUGLAS, Jan. 26 Alberto Garcia,
an independent bandit leader, who with
200 followers has been operating in the
Sahuaripa district of Sonora, Mexico,
surrendered to Carranzu authorities
yesterdav, according to advices re
ceived tonight at Agua Prieta, the
Mexican town opposite here.
Garcia and hftvmen gave themselves
up t0 General Rafael Astrada, com
mander of the Carranza cavalry sta
tioned at Cumuripa, Sonora according
to the telegram which waV received by
wav of Cumpa.s. Carranza officials
claimed this was the last organized
band of bandits in eastern Sonora.
A determined campaign which was
begun against Garcia a few weeks ago
resulted in his surrender. He had been
surrounded on all sides by superior
Carranza forces.
Carranza officials have adopted stem
measures to end bandit operations in
the southern part of the Moctezi'ma
district. Death has been made the
penalty for theft, according to arrivals
from that section today. As a result
eight men have been executed within
the last two weeks, it was stated. One
man was shot for stealing a pig. it was
asserted.
The result of this action has
caused a feeling of greater security
among foreigners in that district and
preparations were being made to tc
open mining properties, it was said.
Announcement that the state depart
ment at Washington had granted the
request of the Carranza authorities for
permission to ship an aeroplane
through American territory from Agua.
Prieta to Naco, Sonora for re-ship-ment
to the Yaqui river valley, was re
ceived today by Ives G. Lelevier, Mex

Privates Wheeler and Pederson.
Details of the trouble were meager
tonight.
According to r'-ports received here
late tonight the trouble started when
four members of D battery stripped

Progreso. Two of them. Wheeler and
Pederson, were taken prisoners by two
armed Mexican civilians and marched
into the interior. The other two sol

WASHINGTON, Jan. 26. Awaiting
confinnalRn from official sources as
a necessary preliminary to any action
by the United States, state depart
ment officials were interested today
in the report from Lorfdon that the
Japanese government has revived all
of the demands upon China included ir.
the famous "Group Five" of the list
of proposals submitted to the Peking
government more than a year ago for
a permanent settlement of outstand
ing issues between Japan and China
There is a conviction in official cir
cles here that any aeCon at this time
hkely to have results toward warding
i ff the new Japanese demands must
be taken by the United States prae-
tical'y alone. With every evidence of
s nipati.etie interests by the Kuropenn
entente allies in the attitude of oppo
sition which the United States took
when the proposals on the "Group
live" originally were submitted, it is
believed, none of these powers will be
inclined to take issue with Japan at
a moment when they are leaning
heavily upon their oriental ally, not
enly for munitions of war, but for
military and naval protection of their
interests in the orient.
The close study that has been made
in Washington of the proposals em
bodied in "Group Five" has only con
fumed officials to their original be
lief th.V if accepted in full by China,
without protest from other nations,
they would lead not only to material
and industrial hut even political dom
ination of China by Japan.
Japanese advisers for the China
government with resulting exclusion
of all other foreign advisers from
Peking, it is felt, would place China
completely under the political control
ol Japan.
While not prepared to make an is
sr.e on that point, however, the state
department is convinced the other
provisions of "Group Five" finally
would close to American commerce
:nd enterprise the open door in China.
It is gathered from the British
newspaper advices that in addition
to revising the demands in "Group
Five" as they stood at the close of
the negotiations in Peking last Jan

WASHINGTON, Jan. 26. Indepen
dence for the Philippine islands within
four years after the pending bMl for
enlarging self-government becomes ef
fective would be authorized by an
amendment to the measure submitted
today by Senator Hitchcock and gen
erally understood to bear the approval
of President Wilson.
The amendment is said to have been
agreed upon by the president and by
Mr. Hitchcock, who is chairman of the
Philippine committee, after a series of
conferences at the White House. It is
similar in general intent to several
other amendments proposed during de
bate on the biil. and contains features
which administration leaders hope will
be acceptable as a compromise.
Chairman Hitchcock said tonight ef
forts would be made to clear the way
for a vote on the new amendment. To
that end he will urge action tomorrow
on Senator Clarke's amendment under
which independence would be granted
in from two to four years, except in
certain .contingencies when the tiuestion
would be referred to succeeding con
gresses. Debate on the bill today centered
about an amendment by Senator Mc
Cumber. authorizing the president to
indicate to the great powers the desire
of the government to extend indepen
dence whenever it shall be warranted,
and to seek agreements guaranteeing
the sovereignty of the islands. Senator
Clapp opposed the proposal, declaring
it would make the action of the United
States entirely dependent on the will
ingness of the powers to maintain neu
trality of the Philippines. .

Friday the president will make fur

Hostilities on all fronts having for
the moment subsided to unimportant
proportions, the political aspects of the.
war again has assumed the chief role
of interest.
The British parliament is discussing
what steps shall be taken to make more
rigid the government's plan of keeping
goods of all kinds from being imported
or exported by Germany. British labor
has decided by an overwhelming ma
jority to support the government to
the full in the prosecution of the war.
The German ambassador at Washing
ton has presented the American gov
ernment a draft of a note concerning1
the sinking of the steamer Lusitania,
which is believed to meet all the
American demands on this issue and
which, if accepted by the German gov
ernment will end the controversy.
Great Britain has answered tenta
tively the American protest against de
laying mails, but will reply more fully
to the representations when France
has signified hVr approval of Great
Britain's attitude. Simultaneously
comes the announcement that in future
French warships will aid the British
navy in blockading the English chan
nel and the North sea.
Some Minor Attacks
Hand to hand fighting between the
French and Germans near Neuvhle oc
curred when the French tried to retake
trenches captured from them by the
Germans. Berlin reports that all the
attacks were repulsed. The French,
however, have taken from the Germans
mine craters they had occupied several
days ago, and in mining operations in
the Argonne forest have destroyed
German trenches.
Austrian Gain
On the Austro-Xtalian front, Italian
positions near Oslavia have been cap
tured by the Austrians, who made
prisoners of 4". officers and 1,197 men,
according to Vienna.

was discontinued atfer the
British had suffered "appalling losses."

Labor Vote for W?r
BRISTOL. Jan. 26, 8 p. m. British
organized labor, on the first' dav of a
conference which has attracted world,
wide attention, outvoted the extreme
socialist anti-war section and adopted
two resolutions expressing a resolve
to carry the war through. James
Ramsay MacDonald, socialist and
labor member of parliament for Leic
ster. and Fhilip Snowden, socialist
member for Blackburn, tried to per
suade the. delegates to vote against
the motions, but when requested to
define , their position clearly they
made evasions and were unable to
convince the conference.
One representative of the socialist
section, when asked to state the terms
cn which the socialists would hv
participated in a voluntary recruiting
campaign, asserted: "On no terms."
The conference is a most compre
hensive one. A large section of labor
ard commerce attended, while seated
on the platform were two French so
cialist deputies and Robert Apple
garth, one of the three founders o!
trades unionism in Great Britain.
Many of the addresses were patri
otic in tone, and James Ramsay Mac
Donald was criticised in unmeasured
terms by his fellow Scotsmen foi
speaking roundabout the resolution
without making his own party's posi
tion clear.
George James Wardle. a member
of parliament for Stockport and edi
tor of the Railway Review, demanded
an expression for or against carrying
on the war, and it was after that
that the convention responded by car

large majorities favoring: labor's co
