Boys Drowned in Pond
List Sunday Scott Abbott,
age 20, son of the Widow Abbott
who lives two miles south ol
Norwood, and Chester Trotter,
17 year old son of Mr. and Mrs.
John Trotter of Cold Springs,
were drowned in the Killian
pond one mile south of town a
bout noon. The Trotter boy was
buried at Oak Forest January
24; the Abbott boy was embalm
ed by R. L. Calhoun, and is being
held to await the arrival of rela
tives. No one saw the boys
drowned, although the pond is in
sight of a dwelling occupied by
Mose Killiau and family. Some
parties passing the pond, which
is by the side of the Cold Springs
road, late Sunday evening, notic
ed a hole in the ice, and saw two
caps on top of the ice. Suppos
ing that someone had broken
through and drowned, they sum
moned help. A number of peo
ple went out from town, taking
a boat. Uneasiness was felt, as
no one knew who it was. Upon
inquiry it was learned that the
above mentioned boys were seen
in town just before noon and
that they had not arrived at
home. After a good deal of pre
pa ration some hooks were used
in a search and soon brought the
Trotter boy to the surface, and
then the Abbott boy. The bodies
were both brought to town aud
placed in the building occupied
by R.L. Calhoun. Coroner R.W.
Ibman ofMtu. Grove was notified
and he arrived about midnight
and held an inquest. No one
knew what time the boys were
drowned, but both had watches.
The Trotter boy's watch had
stopped at 12:8, and the Abbott
boy's at 12:37.

Mines Leased
Three mining men from Jop
lin have secured a 10 year leas
on about 2000 acres of the Dod
son Mining Co.land and about 1,
000 acres of theRoberts land and
wiil proceed with active work, so
they have announced.
They have already done some
mining and taken out consider
able silicate. The land leased
lies between Mansfield and Cedar
Gap and much of it is in the
Lead Hill neighborhood.
This land was operated quite
extensively several years ago,
but mining was abandoned on ac
count of the low price of zinc and
other minerals, but now that the
prices are so high, it is thought
that the mine9 will be a hand
some cuviciena-payer. zinc ore
is now quoted at about $120 per
ton. A rock crusher and sever
al buildings are located on the
Dodson land. The crusher is
about a mile from Mansfield.
The fact that the property has
not been worked recently and
and that no one has been here to
look after it is responsible for
the fact that the buildings are
now in bad shape, but with the
prospect of the advent of early
mining activities on a big scale
we hope the place will again as
sume the healthy condition pro
duced by work and care which
these properties deserve.
There are a number of excel
lent mines and mine prospects
here aud it is to be hoped that
the day is not far distant when
big paying mines will be worked
on every side. Joplin is known
as the to.wn that Jack built, and
who knows but that this vicinity
has as good mines as any in the
Joplin district?- It takes work
to bring the facts to light, and
we hope the mines will show up
big.
Missouri's output of lead and
inc is twice the entire output of
ail the other states in the Union
put together. The largest zinc
mine in the world is located in
Missouri. Of all the minerals
produced in the United States
it is estimated that about two
thirds tomes from Missouri.
Why not expect great things
from Mansfield in a mining way?
Mansfield a Mining Center
The city of Mansfield is under
laid w-ith mineral. We can prove
this by asking our resident prop
erty owners about the wells thev
have had drilled on their prem
ises. In the majority of cases,
they have drilled through one or
more strata of mineral. Now,
why is it that our mineral re
sources cannot be developed?
Wake up, citizens, and do some
thing toward the development of
our mineral deposits. There may
be a million dollars for every
man, woman and child who lives
in Mansfield. Would it not be
nice to have this old .Mother
Earth seen into and to have this
great mineral wealth, developed
and make this little city grow in
to a great big city, with all kinds
of industries on the boom? Why,
we would all run over each other,
buy city lots and build modern
new residences and business
houses. Farms in the surround
ing country would double and
treble in price. They would be
bought for mining purposes and
truck farming. C.
