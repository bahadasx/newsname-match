Dry Amendment
Des Moines, Jan. 27.—Iowa anti
saloon league leaders today faced
the possibility of having to change
their program on the constitutional
amendment -which was enacted by
the last general assembly and must
be approved by the next legislature.
John B. Hammond, until yester
day chairman of the law enforce
ment committee of the Iowa Bus
iness Men's Temperance Associa
tion, claims to have discovered a
serious defect in the proposed
amendment and a test case will be
brought by the association to clear
up the point.
"The error lies in the fact that
the amendment provides for amend
ing the constitution in a certain way
in a certain place, namely to follow
section 26 of article one of the con
stitution," said Mr. Hamimond to
day. "There is no section 26 as the
supreme court has held that what
is commonly known as section 2S
