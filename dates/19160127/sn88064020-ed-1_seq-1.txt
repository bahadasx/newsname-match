NEW CALENDAR.
The Algiers Saw & Planing Mill
is sending out a handsome piece of
art in the shape of a calendar. It
is a beautiful picture of mother and
daughter, elegantly mounted in an
artistic way and is suitable as an or

useful as a calendar.
SAFETY FIRST
Foto's new Folly Theatre has add
ed a new innovation which will be
appreciated by the many who at
tend the shows there nightly. All of
the exit doors in the new theatre
have been equipped with a patented
device hereby any child or person
by merely coming in contact with
the door releases all of the fasten
ings and permits the door to swing
outward. The handle bars on these
doors which go cross-ways are about
the height of a child's head. Lean
ing only slightly against this bar,
releases all the fastenings and per
mits the doors to be open. In the
case of a stampede due to any cause,
all of the exits of course would be
used simultaneously and there would
be no obstructions whatever as the
crowd going against the door would
automatically release the fastenings
and open it. These improvements
have been put on at a great expense
and Mr. Foto deserves the congratu
lations of his many patrons in hav
ing the foresight for giving every
protection possible against fire or
accident of any kind.
FOLLY SOCIAL CLUB.
Preparations are now being made
for the first boat ride and dance to
be given by the Folly Social Club,
on the Steamer Sidney, Thursday
night, February 3, 1916.
The club has for its members all
local young men who have gained
somewhat of a reputation as enter
tainers, and the arrangement com
mittee for this dance is a very com
petent one, consisting of the follow
ing gentlemen: F. F. Ryan, chair
man; E. Keenan, ex-officio; E. Har
ding, B. Barrett. E. Hotard.
The admission fee will be 50c a
couple, and 25c for each additional
lady or child, and judging from the
rapidity in which tickets are being
disposed of, a very large crowd is
snticipated.
A CORRECTION.
Through an oversight on the part
of the person giving us the names of
the guests at Miss Sadie McCord's
Leap Year Dance, which took place
on Monday of last week, the name
of Mr. Frank Berthelot was omitted.

The parade on Saturday night
brought back to many. visions of
genuine campaign time when the pa
rade of the Regular Democrats took
place on this side of the river.
All of the precinct leaders had
large crowds of their supporters out
in line when they went to the city
to form part of the big parade which
later attended the speaking at the
Athenaeum when Mayor Behrman
addressed the gathering.
The voters of the first and second
precincts assembled at Pythian Hall.
and those of the 3rd precinct at SI1
dell and Brooklyn avenue. The 4th
precinct met at Patterson and Val
lette streets, the 5th precinct at Eve
lina and Elmira, the 6th precinct
forming at Opelousas and Elmira.
The usual lanterns and fireworks
added to the enthusiasm of the reg
ular voters.
