The "Sale of Sales"--"different," as always before, from the average clearing
sale. Always bigger values, always bigger stocks and better assortments.
Always newer styles, fresh and clean not a stale or shop-worn article. These
are the things which make Taylor's Clearing "Sales different"

Tliere is no more noted newspaper
annual than the Midwinter Number
of The Los Angeles Times, w hose

Southern California has so manv
unique fascinations that a news
paper which reflects them is in a

it. It is made up of five beautiful
magazines in addition to the usu; 1
news sheets. Five magarne of
thirty-two pages each, with art iov
ens. all printed on fine Siok p tper
in bright colors. The art work is

through this pleasing ptiblicatha
It tells one everything he wants to
know about mxHirvt. prosperity anil
delights of the Southland the cli

as well as dressed in beautiful garb.

Order Garden Seed Early.
Cheap garden seed is often dear
at any price, in the opinion of J SJ
Gardner, of the Missouri College of
Agriculture. A high price is not
neivssarily a guarantee of high qual
ity, but it does not pay to buy cheap
seed which may not grow, or may
not pnxluce vegetables of a good
variety if they do grow. The loss of
time and ground is so great that the
sliluly higher cost of seeds fur
nished by reliable firms saves the
planter money in the long run
The buyer must depend entirely
tt; mi the reputation of the seedman
t- insure his getting seed of the
variety he orders, but afler the seed
has I teen secured, lie can test its
germination power, or get the Col
lege of Agrkiilture to tlo it for him
free ol charge. If he makes the
test bimself.it is better to plant fifty
or a hundred of the seeds in a Hat
bo of earth and see how many of
them ill devekp into plants They
should be planted just as deeply in
the N' as they would if planted 111
the ..irden. This Is a much better
test iia that ordinarily in ide K-
tween moist blotters, or in similar
ways which enable many seeds to
sprout that have not vitality enough
to produce good plants in the gar
den, or even to get thru the soil at
all. It is not necessary to demand
as high a germination percentage in
case of cabbage, tomato or other
seeds that are to Ik? started indoors,
or in hotbeds, and transplanted later,
but in general, at least eighty out of
every hundred tested should grow,
or the seed should not le used.
If it is too much trouble to make
the actual planting test, another
may be made by simply putting
seeds between sheets of blotting
paper, and keeping them moist but
not too wet. and at ordinary room
temperature about 00 degrees F
for a reasonable length of time.
Radishes and lettuce may le ex
pected to sprout in two or three
days, while carrots and snie other
seeds may require much kiii-or
time. If blotting paper is not av; ,1
ahle. several thicknesses of ordinary
newspaper, or perhaps better, ck h
may be used to hold the tnoistt e.
The bottom of a shallow dish shm.id
be covered with half an inch or in
inch of sand, which will keep : 10
blotting paper moist and furn sh
drainage to keep the water fn.in
standing around the seed. If many
tests are to be mad" at race, two
sheets of.paptr, or cloth, between
which the first layer of seods i
placed, may lie made the bottom of
a considerable pile of similar tests
which can be thoroly sprinkled from
lhe top and allowed to drain down
into the sand
It is important that the tempera
ture be kept uniform, ventilation be
good, and the drainage bethoro, and
that moisture be kept r.bont the
seeds. These conditions can lie con
trolled well in many kitchens, living
rooms and basements, but perhaps
the incubator wiil control them
letter than anything else found on
the farm. It would probably not be
a good thing to try to make tests
while eggs are being hatched, but if
many samples are to be tested, the
incubator can be filled up with seeds
enough to make it pay to run it.
If free tests are desired, send
small samples of the seeds to the
Seed Testing Lalior'aiory, College of
Agriculture, Columbia. Mo College
of Agriculture Bulletin.
