STATE WILL TAKE UP SUBJECT
OF HEATING CARS IN TACOMA
If Tacoma wants heat in its street cars and will show that it wants it and
f t+
that it needs it— Then it can have heat in its street cars!
All that Tacoma has to do is to demonstrate that
it, objects to the present mobile refrigerators and
would prefer a reasonable degree of warmth and
comfort.
The public service commission will take care of
the rest.

came sizzling hot in Tacoma today.
It was a letter, written by Sec.
Yandell of the Seattle Chamber

turned the scrap Into a bitter
fight to the finish between Chair

Washington on the one side and

Yandell's letter, printed In a
Seattle morning paper, charged
Chairman Reynolds with mis
statement of facts in his public
charges that the Seattle
Chamber of Commerce has re
fused to enter the fight for dis
criminatory rates because it had
received contributions from the
0.-W.
In brief, the letter declared
that Reynolds did not know what
he was talking about, that the
Chamber of Commerce had been
working on the rate proposition
for a long time.

VOL. XIII. NO. 8a TACOMA, WASH., THURSDAY, JANUARY 27, 1!)1<>.
AP. Co. to provide for tho comfort of its Tacoma
patrons in winter weather has not gone to waste,
even if onr city council lias been sitting back and re
fusing to start anything.
Today Chairman Charles A. Reynolds of the state
public service commission announced that the com
plaint of Tacoma will be given a hearing, along with !
that (he fire marshal and harbor
master refuse to allow high explo
sives to lie loaded on another
transport, the Yaroslavl, which
arrived yesterday, until all other
curgo has been taken off.
The Tambov, with 100 tons of
explosive., aboard, wan still lying
at the dock todny, scheduled to
sail for VladivoHtok tonight.
tit Cms in All!
George T- Held, assitasnt presi
dent of the K. 1., was summoned
to the hearing. On examination
he declared his company was
shipping 94 cars of explosives, for
the Russian government through
Tacoma on the two steamers. Of
this, he said, 42 cars contained
smokeless powder, 30 contained
nitro-cellulus, an explosive which
is only dangerous in case of fire,
and 22 cars of nitrotrltulo, a
modern and intensely explosive
prepartulon used in the European
war.
Fear Knemy Spies.
Reid and Harbor Master Parks
both asserted that the explosives
were being handled carefully and
with a minimum of danger. Mayor
Fawcett and others of the coun
cil frankly admitted that they
did not fear an accidental explo
sion, but are seriously frightened
nevertheless over the possibility
of a spy's sending a bullet into
one of the boxes and thus explod
ing the entire cargo.
"If that occurred," said the
mayor, "not only would the Sta
dium high school be crumpled up
and thrown into the nlr, killing
more than 1,000 persons, but half
of the city would be wrecked."
Secretary Lister of the school
board told the council that the
entire student body and corps of
teachers at the school were in a
terrible fright over the possibil
ity of an explosion of the powder
magazine, underneath them.
School Work OKI iifii'il.
He declared that many parents
were keeping their children out
of school and that the entire rou
tine of the school was being dis
rupted.
The transport Yaroslavl began
loading today, taking on 100 tons
of explosives during the day. She
will remain in Tacoma a full
week.
Fire Marshal Chandler an
nounced after the hearing
that the city laws regarding
Hie handling of explosives
was being laxly enforced and
that Harbormaster Parks wns
negligent.
He said Parks had abso
lutely failed to either notify
liiin or the fire depart mem
of the preeenre of explosives
at the dock.
"Suppose there had been a fire
and the department had rushed
down to the docks Ignorant of the
danger It faced." he said. "The
law demands that he make noti
fications and that he watch care
fully the handling of all explo
sives* Parks has been negligent
and apparently unmindful of the
safety of the city.
Kffect Would Be Awful.
"If an explosion should occur
at the docks today, there Is
enough high power stuff there to
wipe the entire city of Tacoma off
the map.' Every building of over
two stories would be crushed to
the ground. Half the people
would he killed so quickly that
they would not know what had
happened.
"I don't know what the harbor
master's attitude will be. but you
can bet that I will do the beat I
can to enforce the council's order
and insure the safety of the city.
If any attempt la made to load the
THE ONLY INDEPENDENT NEWSPAPER IN TACOMA
remainder of thai highly exploitive
stuff until the last day of taking
i-argo Borne of the offenders will
go to jail."
Mercy! We're to Itlaine!
Harbormaster Parks criticised
The TlniPs at the council sesiiioii
today for having warned Tacoma
Saturday of the dock danger.
"If the newspapers would Just
keep still we would not have had
tills excitement,'' he said. "We
have been handling explosives
through Tacoma all winter and
nobody has ever heard of it before
or become frightened."

in the First Christian church,

ing of all the men ot Tacoma
Christian churches.
At 7:45 p. m. there wih be a

Glelabeur, Rev. W. A. Moore and
H. E. Harmon will speak.
WEATHER
Tacoma: Unsettled tonight and
Friday, probably snow, not much
change in temperature.
Washington: Same.
Than the public service commission will order tha
street car company adequately to heat every car it
owns and operate* in the city. This may not come in
time to help any this winter, but there are other win
ters to come which it will affect.
The public service commission already has evi
dence that The Times' demand for some degree of
comfort in the street cars is not hot air. (No pun in
tended.)
in his room in the Tacoma Motel, Chairman Rey
nolds has scores of letters from prominent physic
ians, complaining of the weather and the atmosphere
in Stone _t Webster's rolling ice boxes, protesting
that they are an absolute detriment to public health.
Actual cases where citizens not only are compelled
Ito suffer discomfort, but are seriously harmed, are
cited by the physicians.
From now on until the tie of the public service
commission's hearing, which probably will be held in
a little more than two weeks, it is up to every Tacoma
citizen to join with The Times in demanding public
lealth and comfort.
Write letters to Chairman Reynolds and mem
bers of the public service commission telling of
the foot freezing chilliness in which you are
compelled to ride to work in the morning and
home in the evening.
Arrange to attend the hearing and voice your
protest in behalf of Tacoma.
And, you physicians, join in for the benefit of
Tacoma's health and comfort.
It is not too late, either, for the city council even
to wake up and act a little, even though it has been
slumbering, hauling slush and talking slush while the
people have been freezing and gripping.
There is still time to give the pneumonia demon __
swift punch below the floating rib.
The public service commission is on the job.
Now get busy, everybody.

Jack Stahl, vice president of
