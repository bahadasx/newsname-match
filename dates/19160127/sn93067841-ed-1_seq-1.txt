A BUSY WEEK IN I
THE LEGISLATURE.;
i r
STRENGTHENING PROHIBITION- t
EDUCATIONAL BILLS-VOTES .
FOR WOMEN DEFEATED. 1
i
The second week of the 1916 ses- j
B. sion of the General Assembly was a r
busy ODe in legislative circles. Many
B important measures were disposed ^
B of; the majority of the bills intro- {
B' duced at this session have been re- .
Vy ported out of committee; most im
portant of all, the law makers have ?
shown a disposition to reduce the ^
calendar, which on account of the {
large number of bills introduced is {
V a 88-page document in the House
B and 18-page one in the Senate. t
? Each week sees the prohibition t
I law strengthened, directly or indiI
rectly. Early in the week the House
B passed the Liles bill, providing for a
m 'term sentence without the option of
W a fine to be imposed on any person
violating any law of the State res'^
garding the sale or shipment of intoxicating
liquors. The Legislature
D bad already passed a measure to
make drunkenness on the public
highway a misdemeanor. It is probable
also that the House will this week
dispose of the bill by Messrs Crum,
Sellers and Wagnon to make an appropriation
of $50,000 for the enforcement
of the prohibition and
gallon-a-month laws; the bill received
a favorable report from the com;
. mittee.
r SCHOLARSHIPS LIVE TOPIC.
The abuse of free tuition and
scholarships in the State colleges has
led to suggestions of remedial legisIlation
in the Senate. A bill by Senator
1 Verner is now pending on second
reading to abolish free tuition and
| scholarships and providing that stu
(dents shall pay at least $40 tuition!
each a year; an amendment is urged r
by Senator Carlisle to allow the stu- a
^ dents to sign notes payable two ?
JL years after leaving school. The '
qyestion will be disposed of this i
W week. *
W [ A plan suggested by Senator Laney r
> ~ of Chesterfield is to have the State F
L board of education to act as a clear- t
ing house for scholorships and free 1
W tuition, which board would investiI
gate the particular merits of each ?
I application. An amendment which r
has been highly commended by some t
of the Senators has been offered by t
Senator Padgett of Colleton county, t
H who would have the fiscal agent of t
H the State board of charities and cor- c
rections investigate the financial i
K status of the parents or guardians ^
I of students seeking State aid and
f report to the General Assembly, c
Abuse of the privilege would auto- r
matically forfeit State aid. t
Woman suffrage, for the first time c
seriously considered and fought for f
* on the floor of the House, met defeat
t Thursday night by a vote of 61 to t
51. The unexpected strength of the v
equal suffrage cause was gratifying c
- to the suffragists of Columbia. i
(The courtes> of the floor was ex- i
tended during the week to three t
speakers from other States. Tues- t
day night the joint assembly was v
addressed by Alexander Johnson of t
Philadelphia, field secretary of the t
- committee on provision for the fee- t

>le minded; Wednesday night the J
nembers of the House heard an $
ible exposition of the single tax $
heory by John Z White of Chicago, J
epresenting the Henry George lec- J
ure bureau; Thursday night Clarence $
Joe of Raleigh, editor of The Pro- J
rress^ve Farmer, spoke to the lower J
louse on "Needed Legislation for i
)ur Rural Communities." The Gen- j
iral Assembly has submitted an in- i
ritation to President Wilson to ex- i
)lain his views on the question of J
lational preparedness. J
The policy of "let well enough t
done" was observed by the House i
vhen it defeated a bill by Mr Har- J
)er to place the compulsory school J
ittendance law in the next general dection
for the purpose of having
;he county made the unit instead of I
;he school district. I
T^nkintr at the matter as a busi- I
less proposition, the Senate by a de- j
nded majority favored the reorganzation
of the engrossing department,
figures were produced to show that
;his department uses an appropriaion
of about $6,500 each year,
vhereas if typewriters and compe?nt
stenographers were used the
;ost would aggregate little more 1
:han $1,000. This action by the Senate
is in accordance with the
>olicy of retrenchment determined e
lpon by the Legislature, and it is t
aid that the bill by Senator Verner s
vill meet with comparatively little t
ipposition in the House. | o
In the House the 2-cent mileage | C
)ill, the rate to apply on railroads \ C
nore than oO miles in length on in- o
;ra-state business, passed with com- b
)arative ease. It was maintained y
ihat the increased travel due to the
lecreased rate would more man, t
:ompensate the railroads for the j f
eduction. v
RURAL CREDITS BILL. n
The problem of rural credits, a ^
neans of* developing home owner-j 2
thip, will come up first in the Sen- j 0
ite, where a bill by Senator Sherard | q
s now on the calendar to authorize t
lpon the approval of the voters in a a
general election the issuance of not v
nore than $10,000,000 in bonds, the j c
jroceeds to be loaned to tillers of ^
he soil on long term credits at a t
ow rate of interest. ! 0
It is presumed now that the fight r
tgainst the South Carolina tax comnission,
created last year, will cen- j a
re principally upon amendments to ' j,
he act rather than the abolition of ^
;he board. It i3 thought also that
he bill toiabolish the State board of;
rharities and corrections, which was
eported unfavorably in both Houses, f
vill not receive much support.
A bill creating a State highway
.ommissionfand providing for State t
egistration of all motor vehicles has I
>een introduced in the House by the e
:ommittee on roads, bridges and n
erries. j o
The purpose of the commission is p
o "instruct, assist and cooperate h
vith road authorities in the various
ounties of (the State in the improve- j v
nent and construction of highways, e
n said counties; to study the sys- j t
ems of road building and main-; C
enance in other States; to make in-, ii
estigations and experiments to de-j s<
ermine the methods and materialsj s<
est suited to road construction and C
o publish bulletins." J

Cotton Glnners* Report.
The ninth cotton ginning report
of the season, compiled from reports
of census bureau correspondents and
agents throughout the cotton belt,
issued Monday, show that 10,766,-.
202 bales of cotton had been ginned
prior to January IB, 191*5. That
compares with 14,915,850, or 98.8
per cent of the entire crop ginned
prior to January 16 last year. The
report shows that 1,149,562 bales
have been ginned in South Carolina
as against 1,424,700 for the year
1914.
It is said that as a conservative
estimate $5,000,000 is now being: expended
annually by munition plants
in the United States to protect themselves
against incendiarism, bomb i
plots and spies and interference in
the filling of war orders. I
