pressure, during a greater por
tion of the time of separating
than at another. The faster the
milk flows through, the lower
the cream test.
5. This would have little in
fluence on the farm where the
same cows are milked clean by
the same milker. However, at
seasons when the average .test
of the herd was low or high the
cream would vary accordingly.
' 6.' The changing of the cream
screw will readily change the
cream , test. However, this
screw should rarely be changed,
therefore it is not a common
cause for variation from day ' to
day.
