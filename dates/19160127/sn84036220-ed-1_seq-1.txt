SUPPORT THE WAR
Conference by a Great Majority Rever
ses its Former Attitude Regarding
the War by Pledging to Assist.
BRISTOL, Jan. 26.—(8 p. m.i—Brit
ish organized labor, on the first day
of a conference which has attracted
world-wide attention, outvoted the ex
treme socialist anti-war section and
adopted two resolutions expressing a
resolve to carry the war through. Jas.
Ramsey McDonald, socialist and lead
er member of parliament for Leicester,
and Philip Snowden, socialist member
for Blackburn, tried to persuade the
delegates to vote against the motions,
but when requested to define their
position clearly they made evasions
and were unable to convince the con
ference.
One representative of the socialist
section, when asked to state the terms
on which the socialists would have
participated in a voluntary recruiting
campaign, asserted:
"On no terms."
The conference is a most compre
hensive one. A large section of labor
and commerce attended, while seated
on the platform, were two French
socialist deputies and Robert Apple
garth, one of the three founders of
trades unionism in Great Britain.
George James Wardle, member of

parliament for Stockport and editor ;
of Railway Review, demanded an ex |
pression for or against carrying on j
the war and it was after that the con i
vention responded by carrying the
vital resolutions, which decided the!
issue of the conference by large ma |
jerities favoring labor's co-operation j
with the authorities to bring about a j
victorious ending of the war. i

ASSOCIATED PRESS RESUME.
Hostilities on all fronts having for I
the moment subsided to unimportant j
proportions, the political aspect of the
\var again has assumed the chief role
of discussion. The British parliament
ts discussing what steps shall be taken
to make more rigid the government's
plan of keeping goods of all kinds from
being imported or exported by Ger
many; British labor has decided, by
an overwhelming majority, to support
the government to the full of the I
prosecution of war; the German am
bassador at Washington has present
ed the American government a draft
of a note concerning the sinking of
the steamer Lusitania, which is be
lieved to meet all the American de
mands on this iBsue, and which, if
accepted by the German government,
will end the controversy.
Great Britain has answered tenta
tively tlie American protest against
the delayiug of mails, but will reply
more fully to the representations when
France has signified her approval of
Great Britain's attitude. Simultane
ously comes the announcement that
in future French warships will aid tlie
British navy in blockading the Eng
lish channel and the North sea and
will take part in tlie examination of
mails as well as cargoes.
Hand-to-hand fighting between the
French and Germans, near Neuville,
occurred when the French tried to re
take trenches captured from them by
the Germans. Berlin reports that all
the attacks were repulsed. The
French, however, have taken from tlie
Germans mine craters they had occu
pied several days ago and in mining
operations in the Argonne forest have
destroyed German trenches.
On tlie Aust.ro-Italian front, Italian
positions near Oslavia have been cap
tured by the Austrians, who made
prisoners of 45 officers and 1,197 men,
according to Vienna.

He stated Unit in his experiences of

iml one half yeurs he had perhaps been
brought in contact with more people
nearing the hundred.year mark than
other en because every community,
made it it point to have their citizens

when lie did not find Unit they

very courses that he advocates, espn- |

and above all u total abstinence from |

Pure Blood the Baeie.
The lecture lust evening was ex
ceedlngly practical, giving the most ef
fective methods, as l*r. Ibtrker lias
found, for the prevention ot disease
and the prolongation of life. The
greatest men of science in Ihe piiKt
15 years have agreed, he maintains.
Hint impurity of the blood is tlie cause
for almost every contraction of iliH
ease. It Is, therefore, the duty of
every individual who desires good
health, lo get his blood into condition.
Tills can he done through tlie funr
tions of four organs, especially
lungs, tlie skin, the intestines and the
kidneys.
The lungs are supposed to Inhale
■all Ihe ogygcn that tlie body requires
and exhale lie carbon di oxide which
is poisonous to the system. If the
lungs are prevented for reasons of
minimum expansion to perform their ;
functions, they should he trained
throtigh a form of breathing exercises,
The skin is composed of millions of
minute pores which should excrete

The intestines are perhaps the most
important of all in their functional re
lation to pure blood, and and for a
healthy condition of these organs Dr.
Barker advocates five tilings to ho
observed, collectively. First, a glass
of hot. water with a bit of table salt,
every morning, followed bv a glass of
cold water; second, a course of ab
dominal exercises to bring nte muscles
into action: third, a system of diet
which banishes meat of all kinds, and
includes whole wheal bread, cereals,
fruits, vegetables and buttermilk or
sour milk: fourth, the drinking of
from eight to ten glasses of water per
day, and fifth, the juice of an orange,
a raw apple, dates or figs before re
tiring at night. The kidneys should
lie kept in condition by exercising the
muscles in the region in which they
lie.
