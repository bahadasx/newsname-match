Letter from the South.
Piinto Gorda, Florida,
Jan. 15. 1916
Editor Journal: On December
27, 1915, we turned our faces
southward once more, and after
a right's journey in a Pullman
berth, we landed iri Nashville,
Ter.n., and were met at thetra'tft
by otfr friend, J. T. Lindsay; su
perintendent of the Pintscfe Co.,i
which furnishes gases for rail
road cars. We spent one week
most delightfully, being enter
tained in a true Southern free
hearted way. There was con
siderable rain white we were
there, and only cold ' enough t
freeze on one nighl. The Cum
berland river was out ofifs'Bafiks
and overflowed1 the low linds,
families having to be moved out
of their houses.
The coal smoke hangs over the
city like a cloud, and it seems to
grime everything outdoors. When
the day is clear and sunny, one
may get a fine view over the city
from the top of the high point
once occupied by Fort Negley.
Another point across the valley
was once occupied as a fort by
the Confederates during the re-
bellion. The State Capitol is sit
uated on another high point and
is a fine old building of former
days. Besides the tomb of James
contain an equestrian statue of
Andrew Jackson, also a statue of
Sam Da 7is, a hero of the Con-
- i . 1 . L!.
federates, wno gave nis me xor
the cause. . j
Southern enterprise does not
always move rapidly, for a car
line to the Hermitage, Jackson's
old home, is not yet completed.
There are motor cars by dozens
and the speed limit seems to be
just as fast as ycfo can go
One cf the interesting things
to see is one of the bridges for
foot passengers and ' traffic1 over
the Cumberland river. This is
ten blocks long and high enough
to allow steamboats to pass under-
At the end,' wereit cornea
down to the roadway, is an im
mense public dumping ground,
where we saw . curious thing to
us, at least. Twdof the men who
were picking over things in search
of iron, rags, &c a regular bus
iness-had each btffltf hhhself a
little shack1 right on the spot, out
of junk, tin sheeting, old mat
ting, &c. Really, our swine are
better housed and less liable to
disease than those in such un
speakable looking places'.

Mr. Lindsay received -a letter
-from thecity officials while we
were there notifying him that
the Hnlsch Gas Compressing Co.
would have to pay three hnigdred
dollars a yeat for the privilege of
running the Business" in Nash
ville. They have always paid
the required taxes, too. He re
ferred the matter to the head of
the company, but said it would
have to be paid.
O jr next stop was at Atlanta,
Ga. , wfiere we paid a short visit to
old school friends of Mr. Wilson.
We arrived at Jacksonville af
ter a night's ride on the Dixie
Flyer, and were there only long
enough to catch the train to Lake
land, where we stopped over
night. We landed in Funta Gor
da the next day at noon. The
same rooms were ready for us
jhat'WoccuDied whennere be
fore and by evening we were
nicely settled;-
A number of those- we knew
two years ago are here again,
but on inquiring we learned that
there are some who will never
return.
One thing more and I am
through for this time. About
one and a half miles from town,
at a turn of the road, is a painted
sign saymg, speea limit, sev
enty miles an hour." Really!
And some wag has added a ci
pher to the seventy, making it
read seven hundred.

The revival meeting in our M.

hree vteeks, closed last night
with a powerful sermon on the

good attention" was given, insur

Regulations for trie Pub
lie Health Nurse of
Greenville.
1. The nurse is to be called
either through the physician or
directly at her office or address.
She responds to every new call,
but the nursing of patients is
continued only under the direc
tion of a physician. She does not
prescribe treatment Or drugs and
gives" them "orriy 1itat the -doc-
r
tor's directions.
2. The nurse's hours are from
8 a.m. to 5 p.m., 8 hours. She
may be found In her office daily
between the hours of 8 to 9 and
lto2. Calls left before 3 :30 p.
m. will be answered the same
day.
3. The Greenville Public
Health Nurse is Miss Jessie Chap
man, who rooms with Mrs. James
M. Mellinger, 112 Harrison ave
nue. Phcne 1031 Blue.
4. On Sundays and holidays pa
tients will be visjted when spec
ial or immediate attention is re
quired. After" hours' thd nurse
will make visits only" at the re
quest of a-ph'yMdan'wTien he is
in atteridahceubf in case of ether
gehcy. -.
5. The nurse is not allowed to
attend certain contagious diseas
es, but will give' instructions in
nursing arid every possible assis
tance to families in which such
cases occur.
6. The nurse is not allowed to
act as midwife where medical at-
tendance is available, nor under
pected to attend nbrmI deliver-
ies. but will answercairs at any
timebfefofe arid after" corifine-
ment.
7. The nurse does not accept
personal presents or money from
patietlts or friends- of patients,
Fees charged go into the f unds
of the association which employs
the nurse. While the services of
nurse are for all, those who can
afford to engage a private nurse
are not expected to utilize ner
services except in an emergency.
When this becomes necessary a
private nurse's fee should be giv
en to the association employing
he riurse.
The fees in other cities are half j
a dollar for each nursing visit, al
though larger sums are sometimes
paid. '
Wherever4 material relief is
needed the nurse will report such
cases to the prbper agency. The
self resoect'and independence of
tM patiehts1 should be regarded
as-Vital: Although a number of
batierits mav not be able to oav
for the service, those who can
will be expected to do so in pro-
portion to their means.
,In conclusion, we desire to em-
phasM that the public health
nurse whether employed by a Clappand petition to sell per
city, county, or voluntary organ- sonal property at private sale
izatidri is not a charity agent.
Her work' is that of a nurse and
a teacher., Further, that while
a large part of her work will be
gratuitous service in the homes
of those vho can not afford to
pay, at the same time she will be
at the Daid service of self - sun
porting families. A family whose
bread-winner earns from fifteen
to thirty dollars a week may not
be able to hire a trained nurse to
give her whole time to a sick or
injured member at home. At the
same time such a family is not an
object of charity. It can afford
and should be Willing to p'ay a fee
for a daily visit from the health
nurse.
This movement can be made
permanent and successful by the
co-operation of our fellow citi
zens. Geo. A. Katzenberger,
Secretary.
