Although the bid of the . Missouri

lower, the contract for publishing the
decision! of the Supreme tfnd Appel

a period six years was awarded
Monday to the E W. Stephens Print

Fail to Get Injunction. .
The contract was awarded a fief the

Rolla Mclntyre, sought and failed to
get an injunction in Probate Court to
stop the commission composed of Sec

don and Attorney General Barker
Judge Slate was not in the city.
Bids for publishing court reports
first were opened in November, and
the Mexico Company then bid $1.15,
Stephen $1.65, delivered, and Buxton
A Skinner $1.35 a volume. All bids
were rejected. ;
New 'bids were called for in an ad
vertisement requiring the bidder to
furnish back numbers of the reports,
the plates for which are owned by the
Went Publishing Company and Steph
ens, the West Company owning them
from 1 to 83 and Stephens the remain
der. No Bid on Back Numbers.
The Mexico concern did not bid ppon
back numbers, holding the statute
contemplates the letting of the eon
tract for current decisions only, and
because to bid on back numbers it
would have had to have gone to its
competitors for an option. '
Roach, Gordon and Barker, before
voting to give Stephens the contract,
declared they believed it highly essen
tial to protect the lawyers and state
against exorbitant charges for back
numbers of reports and that this would
be accomplished under Stephens' bid.
The failure of the Mexico Company
to bid on back' numbers, they held,
left no other course. Stephens' bid on
back numbers from 1 to 83, $2, and
from 83 forward, 11.86.

Write the Ltnger of Nw Orleans and
ita Interesting Historical Place
of Prominence.
THE WEATHER 19 LIKE SUMMER
Found the Old Spanish Market one of
the Most Delightful Spots to Visit
, Many New Kruice.
Mr. Mitchell White,
Dear Sir:
New Orlean'i, La, Jan. 23, 1916.
We have been receiving the Ledger
regularly which we read and certainly
enjoy.
Sorry that I have not more to tell
you about New Orleans, as it is an
interesting and historical old place.
My curriculum extends over every day
in the week except Sunday, so I do not
get much time for sightseeing.
One of the places of interest we have
visited is the City Park. This is a
large park covered with massive
palms, rubber trees, artificial lakes,
and spreading oaks known as the live
oaks. One of these old trees ia es
pecially historical from the dueling
standpoint, as The DeLissue Le Bou
isque duel was fought under this tree
in 1841. This park is beautifully ar
ranged, many artistic flower beds,
gravel auto drives, and the Museum
of Fine Arts and ostrich farm are lo
cated here.
The next place we visited was the
old Spanish fort, known as The Coney
Island of the South'. This park or
summer garden is located on the beau
tiful Lake Pontchartrain. This lake
is twenty-one miles wide, and seventy
five miles long; in fact, joins the Gulf
of Mexico on the north. As the con
cessions do not open-before May 1st,
the lake view and old fort was all to
be seen. The latter or Old Spanish
Fort,. Is standing today just as it did
many, many years ago, long before
the old French settlement here. There
still remain five or six old cannon.
One evening we walked down to the
old French Market and there we saw
fruits and vegetables that we had
never heard of before. This ia one
place no one should fail to visit, on
coming to New Orleans. On our way
home from the market we stopped in
to see the Old Cathedral said to be
the oldest in the United States. I be
lieve it is, from its architectural ap
pearance. It is a quaint old building,
yet beautiful.
New Orleans has a number of large
modern hotels, and at present they are
all 'filled with people from all over
the United States. New Orleans has
one of the largest sugar refineries in
the world, is one of the largest dis
tributing points for bananas.
' The cjimate is ideal here now, do
not have' any fireB or have need for
any. In fact, several days the news
boys were barefooted.
I want to thank you for senidng the
Ledger so promptly, as we are always
eager to get it. We expect to return
to Mexico about June 1st- Will write
again later about things of interest
We wish to be remembered to all of
our Mexico friends.
Hurriedly, yours respectfully,
Dr. and Mrs. Fred Griffin.

LOST 1,544 BOOZE DEALERS.
Jefferson City, '24. The year 1916
finds Missouri with 7,299 liquor deal
ers In the state, a falling off in a
year of 1,544. This information is in
a bureau oi labor statistics bulletin
just made public by Commissioner
Jno. A. Fitzpatrick. The bulletin shows
that the number of Missouri corpor
ations, companies, firms and individ
uals who paid special taxes to the
United States increased from 12,133
in 1915 to 42,304 this year. This in
crease is due to the additional burden
on the country by the war. Internal
revenue receipts from .Missouri in
creased from $13,831,618 for 1914 to
$14,874,845 for 1915, a gain of $1,
543,327 in twelve months,' - -; .
The falling off in the number of re
tail liquor dealers was chiefly due to
ths ruling of the Missouri Supreme
Court in early 1915 that clubs which
sold liquors to their members had to
take out state, county and city licen
ses. There are now 7,909 rectifiers,
whole salers, retailers and manufac
turers of liquors in the state.

ACTRESS BACKS UP THE
REV. Ci'C. SELECMAN
Los Angeles, Jan. 4. A sorrowing
mother's narrative of her daughter's
abwuifii. buiciuv wwb one ox me I ac
tors that caused Re C. C. Selecman
to attack the morafc of the moving
picture camps from tie pulpit of Trin-
ty Methodist Episcopal church, South,
recently, according to a statement
made by' Rev. Mr. JBelecman, Satur
day, Mr. Selecman formerly lived in
Mexico, Mo.
"Get better clothes, no matter how
you get them," the daughter, an ambi
tious young moving picture actress,
reported her director as commanding.
This mortification preyed upon her
mind so much that, while ia a state of
despondency, she slipped away to one
of the parks and attempted to commit
suicide. Physicians saved her life.
It was only one of the instances that
led up to the sermon that has aroused
the entire city" delivered last Sun
dcy night
The girl was present to hear the ser
mon. The young actress, who is well
known on the screen, wrote a letter to
Dr. Selecman Friday, commending him
on the campaign he had begun for the
elimination of vice in the moving pic
ture studios and offered her assistance
in the work. ,
Dr. Selecman again heard from this
sad young woman when she called
upon him personally. Then she bared
her life to him, even more in detail
than she did in her letter.
The letter, without her name, is
herewith published and, according to
Dr. Selecman, is one of the strongest
arguments obtainable substantiating
his charges that "presentyConditions in J
some ol the moving picture camps in
and around Los Angeles are a menace
to the morals of the young girls and
women." The letter follows:
My Dear Mr. Selecman:
"I feel that I must tell you how thor-
oly I am in sympathy with you after
hearing your sermon about the moral
conditions of the "movies." Every
word that was said by you could be
vouched for by me personally.
"Altho very young, I have been in
the 'movies' for nearly four years
and I have been fortunate enough to
withstand temptations that have as
sailed me during these years.
"I would love to help you in this won
derful crusade and if it were not for
the fact that my very bread depends
on 'pictures,' I think I would have the
courage to prove to you that you have
been too mild in your statements. I
know the picture game thru and thru,
all right-minded people in the'movies'
know the sad state of things and de
plore them, but theyTiave not the cour
age to come out and say so.
"Several persons who have denoun
ced you openly in the papers in defense
of the 'movies,' whom I know person
ally, have risen from obscurity to fea
ture stars because of favors solicited
to managers and stage directors.
"Do you know that a little girl earn-
ing steadily $10 per week in any other
business will have saved more money
at the end of the year if she is thrif
tythan an 'extra' at a supposed $3 a
day job J A girl going out to a pic
ture place hangs around all day; she
may get work two or three days per
week, but if she works but half a day
she gets $1.50, even tho she has been
there several days. Car fare, lunch
eon, mal Tip and street clothes and
the wear and tear of the game make it
much worse than any other, profes-
"One-manager told me that I must
have better street clothes, evening
clothes, etc. 'But I can't get them on
mv salary,' I told him. 'I can't help
that' he answered. 'Other girls get
them on smaller salaries. .1 don't care
how you get them but get them."
I had to quit that position.
"There are good people in the 'mov
ies' as well as in other businesses, but
the laxity with which most of them
am run is a menace to the morals of
the girls. As long as the big directors
and managers are called 'sultans with
their harems,' so long will the smaller
men think it proper to imitate their
bosses. , ,
"Success for you in your very great
undertaking. I know you will not
weaken. If all who wanted to help
you were sure it would be confidential
as ta their names and companies, you
would get lots of help, I am sure.
Anything I can do to help you will be
done by yours sincerely, MISS -"

SCIENTISTS KIE THE
PERILS WE ARE PAGING
America faces twenty perils which
may block its road to permanent world
supremacy!
Such is the warning of eminent sci
entists in the country.
The warning of these men of learn
ing make direct reply to the declara
tions of James A. Farrell, Willard
Straight, James J. Hill, George W.
Perkins and other chief American bus
iness men who recently said that
America stood on the very threshold of
supremacy among all the nations of
the earth, if the people would only
grasp the opportunity that the Eur
opean upheaval has tossed upon our
doorstep.
To this enthusiasm of business sci
ence now replies that there are twen
ty perils. ' -
The full list just read before the
American Association for the Advan
cement of Science, the greatest scien
tific body in the United States here
appears. It concludes not only dis
ease, but all the other danger signals
of race deterioration which science de
clares can be seen in every part of
the country.
President Elmer E.Rittenhouse of the
Life Extension institute has brought
this matter before the American asso
ciations, presenting a startling array
of facts and figures.
In the . language of. every day,
President Rittenhouse thus challenges
us: '.
"Are we husky enough as a people
mentally and physically ever to hold
world supremacy or must we. degen
erate into a second rate nationality be
cause we allow these twenty perils to
overtake and rob us of our strength T
The scientists who advance the a
bove reasons were: Dr M. P. Raven
el, Professor of Preventive medicine
at the University of Missouri; Prof.
M. V. O'Shea, Professqr of Education
at Wisconsin University; Dr. J. H.
Kellog, Superintendent and of the
Battle Creek sanitarium; Dr. Luther

BE WASHINGTON P. M.
Speaker Champ Clark Want Hi Sec
retary, to be Capital Post
Master. IS ALREADY RECOMMENDED
If Senate Fails to Re-Appoint Herritt
Chance, Present Incumbent, Basal
ford Will Get It
Washington, D. C, Jan. 26.
Speaker Champ Clark yesterday wrote
Postmaster General Burleson, recom
mending the appointment of Wallace
Bassford as Postmaster of Washing-
ten if the Senate refuses to confirm
the appointment of the incumbent
Merritt Chance, named in recess last
summer. Bassford Has been Mr.
Clark's secretary for many years. He
is a brother of Homer Bassford of St
Louis. , .
Although legally a resident of Mex
ico, Mo., Bassford has lived so long in
Washington that he is eligible to ap
pointment to an office within the Dis
trict of Columbia.
The opinion here is that the Post
master General will indorse the
Speaker's recommendation should the
Senate decline to confirm Chance.
When Chance was appointed during
the summer and after Postmaster Ot
to Praeger had been promoted to Sec
ond Assistant Postmaster General, it
was stated that Chance was "Clark"
Democrat" although he had previous
ly served under Republican adminis
tration. Speaker Clark said yester
day he had never heard of Chance un
til he was named Postmaster and
doubted the accuracy of the statement
that he had been active in his pres
idential campaign.
DR. FRANK CRANE TAKES
UP C. C. SELECMAN
The recent charge of immorality in
moving picture camps made by the
Rev. C. C. Selecman of Los Angeles,
formerly " pastor of the Methodist
church of this city, has aroused wide
spread comment throughout the en
tire country. - Frank Crane, a prom
inent newspaper writer whose arti
cles are copywrighted has the follow
ing to say concerning Mr. Selecman'
charge in a recent copy of the Chi
cago Daily News:
"A clergyman in Los Angle has
stirred things up a bit by attacking
what he calls the immoral conditions
of the movie camps.
All around the metropolis of south-
em California are studios where cine
matograph films are made. To these
establishments flock naturally hun
dreds of young people of both sexes.
The same lure draws them that at
tracts crowds of applicants to the
theatres.
"The parson's charges 1 ave doubt
less some foundation in fact There
never was time or place where n lot
of adolescents were commingled with
out human nature asserting itself; and
it is human nature- to make love,
which - .'; honestly, and others
y..'.. cratly.
"But a moving picture factory is
se no more immmoral than any
other kind of a camp where boys and
girls associate. Sunday school pic
nics, camp meetings, - chautauquas,
any sort of fest where people let go
and play, are dangerous.
Moonlight nights on a transatlantic
liner are dangerous. I myself have
seen surreptitious hand holdings, al
though I fall back upon my constitu
tional privilege and refuse to give evi
dence that might incriminate myself.
"Warm summer evenings are dan
gerous, and flower scented atmos
pheres and leafy paths and shady
nooks. According to my recollection
it used to oe well nigh impossible to
walk with a healthy, lively, beautiful
girl amid such terrible surroundings
and not tell her that she ia the only
and that it seems like we'd al
ways known each other etc. etc, and
isn't it funny how some people are
just natural affinities T
"Seriously here's the error in all ac
cusations of ' immoral conditions
brought against any institution or
class. It is that virtue can be main
tained by rules circumstances, chap
erons and restrictions.
"My personal conviction is that co
education is much better for produc
ing right character than are those in
stitutions where young ladies are con
fined together and no man except the
junitor allowed on the premises.
"And my observation is that act
resses, circus women, and the like av
erage up about as well as the inmates
of Mis Prune's select boarding school
for finishing young ladies. .
A great outcry is made from time
to time about the perils that lurk for
feminine stenographers, shop girls
and other working women. But they
are probably a little higher in general
self respect and can take care of
themselves better than 'young ladies
at home,' at least they don't loaf all
day and dance all night, and sit a
round country clubs and drink cock
tails. .-
"The fact is that women are in
curably good. . And .the more we trust
them and believe in them the better
they are."
