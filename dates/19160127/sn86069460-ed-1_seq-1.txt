ITS MICA MINES
Makes A Tour of Inspection and
Returns Home Much
Enthused.
The mines of the Southern
Mica Company are situated one
hundred miles east of Birming
ham, Alabama. Mr. Harry Wat-
kins, of Birmingham, in Pres
ident and Mr. Louis J. Fox, of
Birmingham, jg secretary nnd
treasurer of the Company. This
company has the fee simple title
to 170 acres and also owns the
miherarTight to a 40 acre tract.
making a total at present of 210
acres of some of the best mining
property I have ever seen. In
addition to the 210 acres the
company has an option on a tract
of 120 acres which joins one of
their properties where the lead
is thoroughly developed and good
mica showing up. The vein haa
also been cut on the 120 acre
tract, and there are several hun
dred pounds mined out of a hole
not over four feet deep. The
company will buy this 120 acres
at once, which will give them
290 acres in fee simple besides
the 40 acres in mineral right All
of these properties are heavily
timbered in long leaf pine and
oak, and the timber itself will be
a very valuable asset to the com
pany. I visited the properties in com
pany with Mr. Harry Watkins,
, of Birmingham, and Mr. J. M.
v Persons, of Marion, Ky. Mr.
Tenons p general manager of
the wnpny. Judge John W.j
Blue, of Marion. Ky., is the com
pany's attorney, and their local
representative; he ia also a stock
holder in the company. The
general office of the Southern
Mica Co., ia at Marion, Ky.
Now in regards to the mica on
the properties of the Southern
Mica Co. I can state positively
that the vein chows plainly on all
of the properties. This will give
the company somewhere near
twscid-one-half miles of the
mifHMf which th.T are two
distinct veins running parallel to
' i eac h other. There is also on this
property a large graphite win,

lead of high grade mica. 1 must
confess I left Marion with some
mis-givingj' to make the exam
inations of this company's prop
erty for parties who are about to
lecome interested in the com
pany. Cut upon my return I am
pleased to say I found the prop
erties showing up much richer
than any report I had seen or
heard of them, indicated. And
I wish to say the Southern Mica
Company's representatives were
very delicate andireserved in any
mentions they had to make about
the valuation of their property.
With further reference to my
own observations will say that
none of the many reports or
statements I had heard regarding
this property has done it justice;
and I see no hindrance of these
mines becoming money,
making, "permanent mines; and
in all probability to be worth
many millions of dollars. I am
frank to nay I found the mines
and property 100 per cent, richer
and butter than I expected to
find them.
The proceeds of any stock sold
by this company will go directly
into the treasury to be used for
the purchase of other properties
and for the purpose of opening
up and equipping the mines, and
I fully believe that in from six
to eight months, when the
properties are fully developed
and the proceeds coming in from
the operations and sale of the
mica that our stocks will be worth
anywhere from 5 to 500 for one.
I am very much pleased to be
come a stockholder in this com
pany and hope to be in position
to secure more of the stock short
ly. ! have no hesitancy in rec
ommending the purchase of this
stock to any of my friends as an
investment they should not let
slip past them.
Furthermore I will take very
great pleasure in showing speci
mens to my friends or anyone
who may feel interested In this
proposition, also that I am au
thorized to sell stock for. the
purpose of working the mines,
and those interested will do well
to see me for investments.

JOINS FIGHT ON LIQUOR HERE
Representative Barkley Offers Bill
to Make District "Dry."
In the House, aa well as in the
Senate, there is now pending a
bill to make the District "drv."
Representative A. W. Barkley,
of Kentucky, is author of the
House measure: He introduced
it yesterday. The bill is in the
precise terms of the Sheppard
bill, presented to the Senate sev
eral days ago. Both would make
it unlawful to manufacture or
sell intoxicating liquors in the
District after November 1, 1916.
It was regarded as somewhat
novel that a member of Con
gress from the State that procur
es more whisky than anv other
Commonwealth in the Union and
that now has three-fifths of all
the whisky in the United States
in its bonded warehouses should
blossom forth as a chamnion of
prohibition.
Representative Barklev said it
is his intention to push the bill
to turn the National Capital dry.
He said it is a mistake to accuse
Kentucky of beirig "a whisky
State," for 114 out of its 120 co
unties are dry.-The Washington

Imitation Is Set At Defiance tij
the Famous Master '
Medicine.
Tanlac! There is magic in this
household word a magic made
oy success unprecedented and a
fame based very solidly op its
accomplishments in more than
one million homes.
The ingredients for Tanlac are
gathered in the remotest parts of
the world. From the far North
woods to Argentina, below the
equator; in Russian Asia, the
Alps, Pyrennes, on the sunny
shores of Italy, from trazil '
Sumatra, Peru, the West Ir.des, .
and the slopes of our own timber
topped Rocky Mountains, come ;
the roots, barks, herbs and even
flowers that, under the direction
ofHerr Joseph Von Trimbach,
the noted German chemist, are '
compounded into Tanlac'
There can be no successful im
itation of Tanlac. It is compound
ed as skillfully and as myster
iously as nature distills the famed
mineral waters of Europe.
Tanlac, now universally known
as the Master Medicine, isprov
ing invaluable against ailments
of the stomach, liver and kid
neys, and catarrhal affections of
the mucous membranes, which,
when neglected, bo often affect
the vital organs themselves. As'
a general tonic for half sick. run- .
down men and women, it builds
up the tissues, creates a keen
appetite, promotes digestion, vit-
