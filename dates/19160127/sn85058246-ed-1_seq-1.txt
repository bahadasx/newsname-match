I WHO WILL BE V
I PRESIDENT OF
I UTAH A. 0, ?
B This lit the All Absorbing Question
flj With the People of the
B State
HJ. Just when tho successor to Prost.
B John A. Wldtsoo win bo chosen
H seems to be n question that every-
Bj body would like to know, but appar-
Bj ntly one that no ono docs know.
B Even thoso who ought to know, flpht
Bl so shy, and put so much Innocenco
into their every expression that their
B nnswer "don't know," carries coavlc-
Bj Hon with It. No doubt evory rnem-
m her of tho board of trustees haa been
H pestered more or less with questions
Bj slnro tho shock that carried tho
Bj news of Dr. Wldtsoo's election to tho
Bj Presidency of tho U. of U. but If any
E ono has succeeded In getting any do-
Bj flntto Information from any of them
B It has not been given to tho public.
B Rumor had it that n meeting was lo
Bj have been held .at Salt Lako City on
M Monday evening at which time a sue-
B ccssor would bo chosen and as tho
B "University Rogenta played a high
fl handed gamo at their meeting the
fl samo thlnB was expected at the A.
B C. session, but nothing camo or It,
B Another rumor was to tho effect that
H a contingent of tho A. C. trustees
B thought It would ho unnecessary for
B them to meet as. tho U. of U. Reg-
H en's nDlJ tlicli"' advisers and cngl-
fl neers would transact tho business for
B tho College board. Still another ru-
B mr was to tho effect that Dr. Widt-
H soo In accepting tho new position
B would recommend a successor, and
fl when the board met It would be no-
fl thing mora nor less than a rntlhca-
B tlon meeting. And when t1u name
B of Dr. J. F. Merrill camo Into tho
fl Tunning matters and things were up
fl In the air. Tho latest Is that Her-
HJ culean efforts are being put forth to
fl Tetaln Dr. Wldtsoo, but when some-
jfl thing -wlirhappen and what It will bo
Bj no one seems to know, and perhaps
BJ It Is safe to say that under tho clr-
BJ cumstances no ono does know. J
BJ One thing Is certain and that is
BJ that the trustees aro equal to tho oc-
BJ casion, and the people may rest as-
BJ sured that when Dr, Wldtsoo informs
Bj them that ho has accepted another
BJ position and is not a candidate for
BJ reappointment Dr. Wldtsoo 13 out
B and is a thing of tho past'. This
Bj does not mean that any rccommenda-
BJ tlons ho makes will not be consider-
Bj cd, for all his recommendations 'no
Bj doubt will bo most carefully ccnsld-
Bj ercd, but all other things will bo
B considered Just as carefully and a
Bj successor chosen who will best
m meet tho needs and demand of tho
B college.
flj From Monroo to Logan tho A. O.
H Presidency Is tho all absorbing top-
B lo and throughout tho cntlro sluto
H friends of tho Collogo nro standing
fl for Its welfare, and anticipating such
fl action on the part of tho trustees
B that will keep and maintain It In its
B, present enviable position.
fl In Salt Lako, Ogden, a3 well us in
B I.ogan tho stand taken by Dr. Widt-
H boo Is still looked upon as a conun-
H drum. How it Is posslblo for him to
B bo "called to a broader field." is
fl something that cannot bo oomprahen-
B ded and passeth understanding. That
B is in plain terms it is a conundrum,
fl and tho skeptics aro still looking lor
H tho "codo" or tho means with which
fl to intorprct tho hlorglyphica.
