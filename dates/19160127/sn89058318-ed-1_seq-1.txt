ALWAYS NEAR
We may not see the path ahead,
So thickly shadows 'gather here,
But we can trust the One who said ,
"I love thee there is naught to fear,
Can feel him near iiVday and night,
If we but stretch our hand and crv,
"O Father!" Faith becomes a sight,
And all our griefs andears pass by.
O near, so near! W.e toui; the hand
That bears the scar of Calvary,
And though I muy not understand,
I know this Savior died for me,
01), the great heart of God is warm .
Its love, its yearning who can tell? f
So welcome sunshine, welcome storm
God's love is round me-.-all is well!.
In steadfast trust I will abide,
Believing, come what may that he
Is ever near me at jrfy side
And that is heaven itself to me,
"What comfort in the thought that he
"We have no merit we eaiyboast
Is always near to you and me,
And nearest when we need him most.

BOY SCOUTS.
The Scouts have been organiz
ed here almost a year, but have
not been active all the time be
cause the former scout master
was busy. They have taken new
life and are now progressing nice
ly. They meet every week, and
useful things are done and talked
about.
The - organization consists of
rtrol'tJiaV i -ot 8 k h?.
I These boys are the best Ihh's in '
town, of course there are other
boys equally as good but these
are among tne nest. A Mouc
makes himself known whereever
he goes so it is not necessary to
give name.
In the strictest sense of the
word these boys have not been
Scouts because . they haven't
stood even the lirst examination.
They will take the examination
this week and will then proceed
to advance to First Class Scouts.
By the first of July they hope
to be'Iurst Class Scouts. No new
menibers will be taken in at
present until they have through
ly mastered the essential ele
ments of woodcraft, canipcraft,"
etc. They will then be able to
coach those who desire to join.
It would be well to start anoth
er patrol of other boys between
the ages 12 and 18. Any public
spirted man can organize them
being their Scout Master. This
Would create rivalry and put
more vim and pep in the boys.
No club can consist of more than
iV2 boys, we have enough boys
between the ages above mention
ed to establish several clubs.
The boys are anxious to join and
they can be greatly benefited.
Let's help them. Get the proper
spirit if you haven't it. The
boys are all right. They need
helping, and will you do your
part? ' -; ,
there may be some in our town
who are opposed to the movement
using as their chief argument the
statement; "It creates a spirit
of war ...in their 'minds. Before
you pass judgment you should
knowiTre about Boy Scouts.
You will find something in this
I column every week, Took for it,
take isure or join the 'throng of
its supporters. The movement
'. : was inaugurated, Feb. 10, 1910
by Gen. Baden Powell ' who saw
the actuel condition of the aver
age business man when required
to exert himself physically. It
has taken in its progress a num
ber of other movements with
their ideals. Dan Beard found
ed the sons of Danial Boone and
Thoin pson-Seton started Wood-
craic iniuans. Jiotn or inese
have been absorbed into the
Scouts. Beard was seeking to
glorify the pioneers and the
hard v virtues of the wilderness:
Seton to foster a love of nature
and out-of-doors, to get boys of
the city to practice the oiit-of
door arts. General - atheletics
and play for adolescent boys was
introduced by Dr. Gulich. Thus
came in new atheletics and the
ideals of chivalry and honor.
The ideals of the order as they
now exist are a combination of
the ideals of all these move
ments. The military , ideal ha3
remained in the form of organi-
zation, tne patrol ana troup, m
the uniform and occasional drills,
in marching and signalling, but
it has disappeared almost entirer
ly from the order. The Scouts
are citizens in uniform. They
usually wear Khaki suits 'similar
to those worn by soldiers but
this is not required. The inove-
mentis; now organized in evetv
country of the civilized ; world;
The boy Scouts bfFer a progres
sive training. There are three
mam orders. When the bov is
first admitted Ji e- becomes a ten
derfoot; as he becomes more pro
ficient in out-of-door life he may
become a second class and final
ly a first class Scout. There are.
merit badges which may be .won
by gaining profliciency and pass
ing an examination in any of the
common trades and crafts.
These are along the line of agri
culture, angling, archery, archi
tecture, art, astronomy and ath
feletics. The things in these sub
jects which must be known to
win honors are exactly the same
as are taught in the manual
training departments of our
High Schools. Skill in these sub
jects can best be acquired while
the muscles are plastic and the
body growing. If a boy wins 5 .
merit badges he becomes' a Star
Scout, if he wins 21 he becomes
an Eagle Scout.
CARD OF THANKS.
We desire to express our ap
preciation to the good people of
Tracy City for their many acts
of kindness and-expressions of
sympathy during the sickness
and death of our husband and
father.
