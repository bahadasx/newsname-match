A YVeekly Keview *
Of The Great War ?<
fi
The capture of the capital of t
Montenegro by the Austrians ii
virtually removes the third of t,<
the three buffer states first in- ^
volved in the war. The Belgians .
11
in France and the Serbians, iti
Albania are continuing the fight, tl
.. c/ he Montenegrins are cut off o
fr* tn retreat and their king has S1
all but succumed to the in- v
evitablo. Montenegro is sur- ^
rounded on three sides by the 11
Austrians and on the fourth side | ^
are the Albanians, hardly less ?'
hostile to the Montenegrins. 'a
The conquest of Montenegro is a'
an important victory tor Austria, ol
not because it adds much to her -
territory or relieves her of a ^
dangerous foe, for Montenegro is
both small and weak; but because
it puts Austria in secure "
possession of the hay of Cattarn. t:
"the Gibraltar of the Adriatic." Q
So long as this port was domina- w
ted by guns on Mount Lovcen ( '
the Austrian warships were not tt'
safe here. In fact in October, ct
they were driven out of the in- ^
ner basin, the Gulf of Oattaro, a
as well as the middle basin, 81
Teodo Bay, by the four guns of sc
4% inch caliber which the
French marines stationed on tt
/ Mount Lovcen, If the Frenfch P
hud carried out their Dlan of r(
mounting 6-inch guns on the
summit, the Austrian shipping P1
would have been swept from the ttl
outer harbor and the forts about P1
the bay reduced. The concrete
foundations had already been tl
IS laid when in May, 1915, Italy en- ^
jb^^fered the war and undertook the ^
J defense of the Adriatic- hi
f Hut the Italian navy failed to ()<
r guard tlie. months of Cattaro as h
closely as the French and Brit- h
ish had done previously, so the tl
Austrian submarines have got c'
out and have been raiding Medi- -A
teranean commerce with impuni- u
ty. The Italians also failed to C
keep their promises to send
troops and heavey guns to defend
Mount Lovcen, although Kt
they have been free to cross the w
Adriatic any time during the t'
last seven months. 80 it seems C(
as if Nicholas had lost his king- t'
. dom through the neglect of his e
son-in-law, the King of Italy,
In reality the fatal d( lay was ^
doubtless duo to a difference of Of
opinion among the Italian uu- b
thorities as to the conduct of ??
war, some of them being strong b
ly opposed to any participation T
in the lialkans. Recently, how- t-1
ever, it was decided to enter up- ">
on a campaign in Alban a and NV
troops have been transported
across the Adriatic to Durazzo t
and Avlona, although apparent- C(
lytCoo late to prevent tfie l>ol '1
gars and Austrians from over ?
running Albania as well as Mon- ,
fi
, te negro. 1

he wounded have been lodged
i Achilleit n Castle, the Msdi
erranean villa of the German
impbror, which was built for
he Princess Elizabeth of Ausria
in 181)0.
The German papers denounce
lie ia<sing of the French flag
ver Achilleion as a personal injlt
to the Kaiser as well as a
iolation of the Greek neutrality
worse evoii than the occupa<?n
of Salonica since Corfu, is
ke Belgium, under a guarantee
I perpetual neutrality by Engmd,
Itussia, Austria, Prussia
nd France in the treaties of
t' November 14 1803, and March
), 1854. Corfu was up to that
me under the protection of
reat Britian, but the inhabi
tnts longed tor union with their
elienic brethren and irtanifeeitions
cf disaffection were freuent.
Finally Bulwer Lytton,
hen Secretary of State for the
olonies, took the unconvention1
step of sending Gladstone, be
mse of his interest in Greek
terature, to the Ionian isles as
commissioner to learn the deres
of the people, and as a con;quence
the seven islands were
un6ferred to Greece, which was
jen placed under a Danish
rince, George, father of the
signing King Constantine.
The Greek government has
rotested to the Allied l'owers
gainst this new violation of her
eutrality, but is not likely to
ike any further action since j
le Allied troops already on
reek territory outnumber the
reek army. The Allied Lowers
ave informed Greece that their
icupation of the island is only
jmporary "in order to save the
eroic Serbian soldiers from faline
and destruction." It is
laimed that the German and
.ustrian submarines have been
sing the sheltered inlet3 of
orfu for repairing, and replenihing
their fuel.
It appears that the German asitilt
ot the French lines last
eek was a nwtre serious affair
iiat was at first reported. Aeirding
to the French account
le Germans bombarded their
ntrenchments along a front of
ve mlies near the butte of Le
lesnil for four days, firing 100,30
shells in the last twelve
ours. Then they charged, not
1 solid column as they used to
ut in four successive waves.
hree waves were stopped by
ue curtain of lire from batteries
f the French 75'sbutthe fourth
ave gained tne lirst line of
reaches for a distance of three
r four hundred yards. Most of
liis was recovered later by the
mmter-attacks of the French,
he Germans used asphyxiating
as< s but to little effect, for the
ind changed and blew the
Limes back over their own ranks,
he French unofficial estimates
ive the enemy's losses as over
5,000.

BIG CHAUTAl
TOGET
Next week is the week!
Three days of the finest entertainment
Chesterfield has ever
enjoyed are sohednled for Feb.
4th, 5th, and 7th.
In the forenoon of each day
there will be addresses by such
men as Mr. Swearencren. State
Superintendent of Education ; E.
J. Watson, State Commissioner
of Agriculture, and our own respected
cilizen, the Hon, W. F.
Stevenson.
It cannot be too strongly impressed
upon the people ot the
town and surrounding communi
ty that this Chautauqua is not a
money scheme. Aside from a
legitimate fee to the artists who
are to entertain us there is to be
no financial profit to anyone.
This is an unselfish move by
certain citizens with the praisworthy
endeavor of furnishing a
high-class entertainment that
will be of distinct value to the
com m unity.
The attractions uro of a high-;
class and will be both educational
and pleasing to all. The following
gentlemen pledged three
hundred and sixty dollars to obtain
for Chesterfield the Chautauqua:
Emsley Armfield, C.
L Hunley, H. M. O.lom, W. G.
White, Jr., D. I*. Douglass, Walter
Douglass, C. C. Douglass, F.
M. Therrell, I- F. Mangum, J.
O. Rivers, L. EL* Trotti, J. A.
Welsh, S. A. l'orter. W. J. Ferry
and I). 11. Douglass.
If enough tickets are not sold
these genr.lemen will have to go
down in their pockets and make
up a deficit; if more than enough
tickets are sold to pay the guarantee
to the Chautauqua management,
$;?>0.00, the balance
will be given to the Chesterfield
High School. 1

Editor The Advertiser:
Will you kindly allow
lie space in your paper to set
oefore the public a clear statenent
of some matters in which '
it least a certain portion of the
jeople are interested?
I refer to stories concerning
ny past life now being highly 1
iolored and industriously circuated,
presumably with intent '
o injure the man now holding ;

km a fugitive from justice from

s a nice little story, very cunlingly
devised, detailing how '
)he papers for my arrest are in

>ut of friendship for ine has reused
to serve said papers. Now ,
n this connection, 1 h ive deem;d
it best to allow the clerk -of '
he Superior Court of Cleveland
bounty, N. C., to speak for mo.
dere is his statement:
