Taxes Paid Under Protest.
The National Union Bank and
the Peoples' National Bank of
Rock Hill, the First National
and the Savings Bank of Fort
Mill, the National Bank of York
and the First National Bank of j
Sharon, have paid this year's
taxes under protest. Inquiry at
the office of the county treasurer
yesterday morning developed the
fact that that official did not
know the reason why such action
was being taken by the banks.
Information received from a
well known banker yesterday
afternoon was to the effect that
the taxes were paid under protest
uner the instructions of the
state banker's association and
that the precaution was based on
the case of the National Union
Bank of Rock Hill against the
county treasurer in which the
bank seeks to recover alleged
"overpaid" taxes. "We have
paid under protest," said the
official, "pending the outcome of
the case now before the supreme
court. If the National Union
bank wins their case we also
want a refund of taxes." ?York-1

Nay Pour Liquor Out.
According to despatches from
Columbia, some of the members
of the general assembly favor
reopening the dispensaries long
enough to dispose at retail prices
of the liquor remaining on hand,
while others believe it would be
better to sell the remaining
stock at wholesale prices to some
parties outside of the State. But
both of the propositions are
being fought by the prohibitionists
on the ground that the state
has no more right to sell whisker,
or the counties, than the
people, and this would assist the
blind tiger business, and that the
stuff ought to be poured out.
The Congressional Race.
The fight up in the 5th Congressional
district next summer
is also attracting attention.
Congressman D. E. Finley, who
has served that district since
1898, will be opposed by W. F.
Stevenson of Cheraw, who was
in the second race with him in
1914. There is talk that J. E.
McDonald of Winnsboro, who at
one time was solicitor of the 6th
circuit, may be in the race. It is
known that friends of Mr.
McDonald have been urging him
to run, but he has not given any
definite answer. Attempts are
also being made to get John T.
Roddey, former mayor of Rock
Hill, in the race. It has long
been known throughout the 5th
district that unless a candidate
can break into the strength of
Mr. Finley in York county there
will be small prospects of beating
him. However, that race is
looming up more every day.?

Gang Term for "Pistol Toters."
A straight chaingang sentence
without an optional fine is the
penalty provided for carrying a
pistol in a bill that has l>ppn in-1
troduced in the lower house of
the legislature by R. Burton
Hicks, a member of the Spartanburg
delegation. The proposed
measure which the author is con-;
fident will go a long way in helping
the courts stamp out the
pernicious habit or "carrying
guns" was sent to the judiciary
committee of the house last
night
In brief the law would impose
a sentence of not less than six
months or more than two years.
Exceptions to the penalty are
provided in case of officers of
the law, a person on his own
premises or in the event that an
armed person is able to show
conclusively that he had reason
for believing that his life was in
danger at the time he carried
the pistol, or other weapon of i
attack or defense.

MEMBER OF COUNCIL
CAN'T HOLD CLERKSHIP
The question has arisen as to
whether a member of city
council, which position now carries
a small salary, could legally
serve as city clerk ana treasurer,
which also pays a salary, some
davs aero caused Mnvnr R F!
Patterson to write Attorney
General Peeples for an opinion
in the matter and the mayor has
received the following letter in
reply:
"Columbia. Jan. 21st.
"B. E. Patterson, Mayor,
"Fort Mill. S. C.
"Dear Sir:
"In reply to yours of the 17th
inst., I will say that in my
opinion, it is unlawful for the
same person to hold the offices
of city clerk and treasurer and
alderman at one and the same
time, as they are clearly two
offices and the holding of both
at the same time is prohibited
by the State constitution. The
acceptance of one office, under
the law. vacates the foimer
office held by the officer.
"Trusting that this gives you
the desired information, 1 am
"Very truly yours.
"Thos. H. Peeples,
"Attorney General."
It is presumed that the above
decision of General Peeples will
necessitate the resignation of
Mr. W. A. Roach oither from
the board of aldermen or the city
clerkship, and it is expected that
the council will take action in
the matter at its next meeting.
The Columbia Chamber of commerce
has adopted resolutions
