WILSON TO SPEAK TWICE IX
IOWA.
President's National Defense Itiner
ary Includes Des Moines and
Davenport.
Washington, Jan. 20.—President
Wilson plans to speak in Pittsburgh,
Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Kan
sas City, St. Joe, Des Moines and Dav
enport on the first trip he will take
to lay his national defense program
before the country. He expects to
leave Washington January 28 and
remain away one week.
An itinerary for the tour was prac
tically completed tonight. It was
drafted with the view of including as
many cities as possible in six days.
Many points had to be stricken off
the list, one of these being Cincin
nati.
Preliminary plans for the second
trip, to be made about the middle of
next month, already are being con
sidered. This journey will take the
president as far west as Denver and
if possible will swing through the
south.
Pittsburgh will hear the first pre
paredness speech Saturday, Jan. 29.
In New York Jan. 27 he will speak
before the Railroad Business associa
tion and the Motion Picture Board of
Trade. He will return to Washing
ton to attend a dinner given by the
secretary of the treasury and Mrs.
McAdoo Jan. 28, and that night will
leave for Pittsburgh.
Special importance is attached by
the president to his address before
the Railroad Business association,
and he is expected to speak particu
larly on the need for business prepar
edness and the necessity of the rail
roads and manufacturing plants get
ting ready to assist the government in
time of danger.
Messages from the cities chosen as
stopping places indicate that elabor
ate plahs will be made for the presi
dent's reception. In St. Louis a par
ade is in contemplation.
In addition to the cities selected
for formal addresses, the president
probably .will deliver a number of
short speeches from the train.
Mrs. Wilson is expected to accom
pany her husband on the trip. While
the president is away he will be kept
in close touch with the European
and Mexican questions by Secretary
Lansing.
Do A Little Thinking.
Elsewhere in this issue of The Re
porter is a well written article by a
Decatur county farmer, A. M. Chris-1
man, who owns a farm on Weldon
creek east of Leon, on the subject of
taking steps to prevent the excellent
bottom farm land along Weldon from
overflowing, and we commend the
article to our farmer readers, espec
ially to those who own l&nd along
Weldon creek. There is a tremendous
loss every year or two on account of
Weldon and other creeks in Decatur
county overflowing, and the farmers
should be up and doing in the way of
taking steps to prevent a recurrence
of this loss year after year. Drainage
has been tried out in other counties
and it has proven a most profitable
investment to the land owners. Why
should not Decatur county farmers
be taking advantage of the opportun
ity to improve their farms. Right
down below us in Mercer and Harri
son counties, Missouri, there was re
cently presented a big petition to es
tablish a drainage ditch, straighten
our Grand River, and stop the loss
by overflow on the rich farm lands
of the Grand River bottom. When
the hearing was held on the petition
there was not a single land owner
made any objections to the establish
ment of the big drainage district.
They have been convinced that it
means thousands of dollars to them
every year, and insures them a crop.
Read Mr. Chrisman's article, and do
a little thinking and figuring.

ISSUE IMMIMV CARDS
To Auto Owners Who Have Paid for
License but Have Not Yet Been
Supplied Number Plates.
Failing to get enough automoblie
number plates to meet the demand
for 1916 registration, W. S. Allen,
secretary of state, Saturday began is
suing ."immunity" cards to persons
who have sent in the registration
fees but have received no new plates.
The cards are intended to protect
automobile owners from arrest after
he has complied with the law, but is
unable to display a 1916 number
through the inability of the state to
supply the plates. The secretary of
state has been struggling to get suf
ficient plates, but the two manufac
turing plants having the state con
tract are several months behind in
deliveries.
The "immunity" card reads:
"This is to certify that the person
named on the reverse side of this cer
tificate has registered a motor ve
hicle described in an application on
file in txiis department and has paid
the fee required by law, for the per
iod ending December 31, 1916. Regis
tration number appears on reverse
side. On account of delay by the fac
tory, in supplying us with number
plates, we are unable to forward
same to you now. We will do so as
soon as the factory can furnish
them."
The registration of automobiles is
now approaching the 75,000 mark.
The department is 30,000 behind iu
sending out plates.
The supreme court has ruled that
an automobile owner who has sent
in his fee to the state and has tried
to comply with the law, is not liable
to prosecution if be fails to display a
number plate on his car through
failure of the state to supply the
plate. The state has experienced
this same difficulty in years gone by.
The secretary of state thought he
had the 1916 supply well provided
for, but the firms submitting bids
began scrapping last fall over which
was the lowest bidder, and the result
is that the department is suffering
through inability of the contractors
tb fulfill the terms of their agree
ment, the officials say.
"I was opposed to letting the con
tract to the firm now having it, but
the other members of the executive
council overruled me," said Mr. Al
len, in an interview at Des Moines
recently.

Casket Co -to build him a new auto hearee after his own ideas, and the above cut shows that these, ideas
have been evolved into a beautiful and practical funeral car. The chassis is a Cadillac with an abundance of
power to carry the heavy weight Of the hearse, and the new auto hearse will be in demand whenever the
roads are in shape so that an auto hearse can be used. Mr. Stewart, although the new hearse represents an
outlay of several thousand dollars, will not make any extra charge whatever for the use of the auto hearse for
any funeral which is ixi his charge. He will sjbill retain his fine horse hearses and undertaking wagon for use in
emergency cases or when the roads will hot permit the use of the auto hearse, but expects to use the new:auto

donations.
