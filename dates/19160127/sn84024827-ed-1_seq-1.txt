SHIP PURCHASE BILL
IS LIKELY OF PASSAGE
Other Items Include Creation
of Nonpartisan Tariff Board
Independence for Philip
pines and Others.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 26. Prospects
for the passage of the government
ship purchase bill are believed bright
by administration leaders who saw in
the President's conference with Demo
crats, who opposed such measures
'ar.t year, indications of united support
for the revised proposal eventually to
be won.
The President continued to urge lead
ing member? of Congress to hasten
action on important legislation. He
dincussed the ship bill particularly
wHh Majority Leader Kitchin, of the
House, and Senator Clarke of Arkan
sas. Later Kitchin said the bill, if
presented as outlined to him, would
receive his rupport. Clarke was non
committal. Some of bis friends be
lieved the measure could be submitted
in the form to meet his approval.
Snator Simmons, Chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee, and Repre
sents ve Fitzgerald, chairman of the
Tlojire Appropriations Committee, are
amongthose who conlerred with the
President. The President made it
clrir that the matter before Congress
he hoped to see pushed ahead of ev
erything else were the following:
National defense measures, the chea
tion of a merchant marine, designed to
serve as arr'auxiliary in time of wat,
revenue legislation, including the re
vision of the income tax, the creation
f non-partisan tariff board, the Philip
pines selfgovernment, which would in
clude a provision for granting their
independence within from two to four
years, provided satisfactory steps were
taken in the meantime to establish a
Ftable and independent government,"
the conservation of bills for the devel
opment water power and mineral
bearing lands.

ACTION WILL RE
Democrats and Chief Execu
tive will Try to Put Through
Ratification of Agreement
with Latin Countries.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 26. The ad
ministration's determination to force
action as a part of its Pan-American
policy on its treaties with Colombia
and Nicaragua, held up for more than
two years, spurred the Democrats ot
the Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee to fix next Wednesday as the
date for a vote on the Columbian
treaty. An effort will be mad i to
then get Nicaraguan pact to avote.
Some senators predicted both cnt'.id
be recommended fcr ratification. Both
Democrats and Republicans ha' e
their doubts regarding reception in
the Senate. Opposition to the Colom
bian treaty, which proposes to jay
Colombia $25,000,000 for its separation
from Panama with an expression pf
regret that anything should have hap
pened to mar the relations of tho two
countries, is based on various grounds.
Many senators believe $25,000,000
an excessive amount, insistiug that
half or even less would be equitable.
Others are insistent that no language
should be used which might be con
strued as an apology by the United
States for the acquirement of ' the
canal property. Others object to the
Vimuiain whirl, -
;wlse merchant shins nf Cninmhia h
right to pass through the canal with
out payment of tolls. There is even
stronger opposition to the Nicaraguan
treaty.
This proposes to pay $3,000,000 for
an option on the Nicaraguan canal
route and for a naval base at Fon
seca Bay. One of the complicating
features is the objection of Salvador
and HonilnrAS. which own nrnnprtips
of tne ghore of Foneca B Tn
sist Nicaragua had on right to permit
the United States to establish a naval
base there without their consent.

WASHINGTON. Jan. 26. Estimates '

ing tha'. a plant costing $400,000,000
operated by three quarters of a million j
workmen, would be required to manu-;

r?cesary to keep an army of a million
in the field and to equip an additional j

The committee received a draft of'
the tentative measure from Garrison

nropo.-ed continental army in general '.

worked out by the War Department j

Crozier disapproved of any proposal j
of the government for a monopoly of
the manufacture of war supplies and
insisted the best results were to be
had by relying upon private establish
ments to supplement government i
p!?r:ts in time of war. j
Crozier reiterated the statement that .
the present reserve stores for the ar-
try were Inadequate. He pointed out
that practically all public and large!
private munitions plants were near the j
Atlantic within nfsSyg distance of an
invading army. He urged that the de- j
velopmer.t of private plants in the in- j
terior be fostered.

Their Acceptance by China

Dominance of China.
WASHINGTON, Jon. 26. State De-
jn the "group of five" list of proposals ,
Isiitmitted to the Pekin government
; m(,rp tPan a year ago. Study of the
! proposals In Washington leads to the
btij0f that, if accepted by China, they
! would lead not only to the material
an(i industrial, but political domina-
tinn of China by Japan.
The conviction in official circles
here H that any action towards ward
ing off new Japanese demands will be
taken by the United States alone.
(while the Entente allies are in sym-
pathy with the opposition of the Unit
ed States , to the original "group of

the powers will be inclined to take is-
sue with Japan now when depending
