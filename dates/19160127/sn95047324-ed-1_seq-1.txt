IN THIS COUNTRY
Ample Supply Available in New

SAYS GEOLOGIST McGRILLIS
Also An Inexhaustible Quantity
in Middle and Southern biaies
Known to Agricultural Colleges
Tested by the Government
Cambridge, Mass. Why is pot
ash selling at $450.00 per ton
when there is enough of it avail
able in the New England States
to supply the whole world for
many centuries f "Who is it that
is keeping this fact from becom
ing generally known and what is
the reason? Our State Agricul
tural Colleges well know of this
easily, available potash supply.
They are also well aware, or
should be, of its extreme cheap
ness and solubility -for agricul
tural purposes, for many of them
made testa as far back as 1889
and proved without a question
the value of this enormous potash
supply at our very door.
The Agricultural Department
at Washington has made very ex
tensive tests and found that this
silicate of potash is soluble in
the soil and as easily and quickly
available for plant life as the Qer
jnan Potash Salts. These tests
.are all scientifically described in
Bulletin 104, Bureau of Plant In
dustry, Agricultural Department,
Washington, D. C. entitled "The
use of Feldspathic Rocks as Fer
tilizers." In most of the Middle and a
large number of the Southern
States there is an inexhaustible
supply of potash feldspar that
will run from six to fifteen per
' cent, potash. In the State of
Georgia large deposits of potash
feldspar can be found in Chero
kee, Lumpkm, Rabun and several
other counties. In North Caro
lina, deposits can be found in
Alexandra, Buncombe, Hickory,
Clay,Cleveland,Gaston, Haywood,
Mitchell and many other counties
in unlimited quantities.
Professor Allerton S. Cushman,
formerly with the United States
- Agricultural Department, states
in the Bulletin above mentioned
that the potash in these felds
pathic rocks, when ground 200
mesh fine and mixed with the
soil, becomes soluble and avail
able for plant life very rapidly.
There is scarcely a county in all
New England that hag not many
large deposits of feldspar rock
which will analyze from six to
twelve and fifteen percent potash.
The cost of quarrying and pulver
izing on a fairly large scale
should not exceed $3.00 to $4.00 i
per ton.
I would advise every farmer in
this country to send to the Bureau
of Plant industry, Agricultural
Department, Washington, D. C,
and secure a copy of Bulletin 104,
if he has any desire to obtain a
supply of potash almost for the
Asking, which is without a ques
tion soluble and available when
pulverized as above stated. If
he is unable to obtain this valua
ble bulletin, owing to its being
out of print, I would suggest that
!he make a request through the
Congressman from his District
ahat another edition be printed
immediately by the Government
for distribution.
The old doctrine claiming that
plant food must be either water
soluble or soluble in dilute
acids before being mixed with
the soil in order to become quick
ly available, has long-since been
exploded. It was always a de
lusion. The bacteria of the soil
do not function or thrive proper

of an over-abundance of inorgan
ic plant food and a liberal amount
of humus. W. N. McGRILLIS,

encourage the growing tendency
for more home pride, for more ap
preciation of our particular local
ity; a higher and fonder opinion
of our local worth, the successes
attained and the possibilities
within reach, but without so much
depreciation of neighboring lo
calities. Choke the grouch and
the knocker and let the booster
spirit prevail throughout the
land. When an Arcadia booster
tells the stranger that Wauchula
only twenty-five miles to the
north of us is too cold for win
ter gardening he makes as big a
jassack of himself in the eyes of
that stranger as does the Punta
Gordan when he tolls the strang
er that its too cold to truck a
round Arcadia. The same jassack
is on the job at Fort Myers tell
ing the same story about Punta
Gorda. Every loyal South Flori
da booster knows and can prove
that his own particular section is
the choice spot of the entire U
nited States, but he can do it with
out bearing false witness against
his neighboring section. In short
the truth is good enough for all
practical and honest purposes
when it comes to boosting South
Florida. Arcadia Enterprise.
Spray for Scab Before it Appears
Do not wait until scab and mel-
anose appear before spraying for
them. It will be too late to do
anything then. Neither can be
cured. They must be. prevented,
according to B. F. Floyd, plant
physiologist to the University of
Florida Experiment Station
Pruning dead wood is a good
measure against melanose but it
is about too late for that now.
Both lime sulfur and bordeaux
are recommended for scab. The
lime sulfur should be mixed in
the proportion 1 gallon of 32 de
grees Baume stock solution to 30
gallons of water. If the solution is
weaker than 32 degrees, smaller
quantities of water or more of
the solution should be used. Bor
deaux is recommended in two
strengths, 3:3:50 and 5:5:50. The
same spraying is thought to be
effective in helping to control
melanose.

Prof. James O. Bickloy, county
superintendent of public instruc

gives an interesting resume of the
progress in educational interests
made in DoSoto county during
the past two years. The follow

The school term has been
lengthened from five to seven
months: we have delivered or
have on hand for delivery, libra
ries for 51 rural schools; we have
raised the standard of efficiency
among our teaching force 100

home economics have been intro

provision made to extend this
work into the rural districts; ex

been inaugurated and successful

agent in co-operation with the
State Agricultural College; to
stimulate greater endeavors priz

arrangements have been perfect

schools will be given an opportun

buildings aggregating in value
with equipment more than $235,

that has been made on the old
buildings in the way of painting

the grounds.

Brought to Attention of the War
Department
J. E. Bowdoin of Charlotte
Harbor, who is taking an active
interest in the bridge proposition,
went to Jacksonville recently to
interview the army engineers and
ascertain if the construction of
the bridge across Peace river at
this point would be authorized.
He was given theiollowing mem
orandum by Maj. W. B. Ladue,
by which to proceed, indicating
that if the bridge conies up to
certain requirements, its con
struction will be approved:
1. Resolution of County Com
missioners oi uesoto i.oimiy
authorizing construction of
bridge.
2. Letter addressed to the
Secretary of War, through the
District Engineer, Jacksonville,
Fla., requesting permission to
construct the bridge.
3. Letter of request to be ac
companied with drawings in
quadruplicate showing the loca
tion of bridge and general type
of bridge. Blue prints' will ans
wer. Not to exceed 8 x 12 1-2 in
size.
4. From information received,
it is thought that if the draw of
the bridge is located in prolonga
tion of the dredged cut. and if
the draw provides for a clear o-
pening of 50 feet between fenders
with clear height of 10 feet a-
bove mean high water, that De
partment will approve the plans.
This is subject to correction if the
public hearing brings out any
thing new.
