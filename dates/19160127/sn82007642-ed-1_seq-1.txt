States vllle Landmark.
The outburst of indignation on
account of the massacre of Amer
icans in Mexico last week was
natural, and it is proper that
ourgovernment should use ev
ery legitimate effort to see that
the murderers are punished. But
much of this outburst, and most
of the clamor about' the foreign
policies of ,tbe administration,
are for partisan purposes. The
loud mouthed critics are more
concerned about the protection
of American lives and American
property abroad than is Mr. Wil
son. Politics is the controlling
motive and the critics hope for a
partisan' .advantage. Had Mr.
Wilson intervened in Mexico or
gone to war with Germany, these
same critics would be denouncing
him for plunging the country in
to war. In the Senate, Friday,
Senator Stone, chairman of the
foreign affairs committee, avert
ing to the Mexican affair, said:
"On this occasion, more than
any time in the last five years
we ought' not to endeavor to em
broil our government with Mexi
co. We ought now to aid Car
ranza to establish a government
ftrmlv to maintain order. Can it
be we!are going to co-operate
with Villa and Zapata to help
overturn this government before
it is established?.
"I do not believe a Senator on
the Republican $ide would vote
ft r war. If this is to be partisan
politics we" are going into as a re
sult of these resolutions. I am
here to say that the President of
the United States is too big to
involve s6 "much' life and hope in
war for politics.
"If we were capable of it, the
best thing that could happen to
him and the Democratic party
politically would be to have war
with Mexico and ; also with Eu
rope. With such war raging next
November the chance of the Pres
ident being re-elected woul be en
hanced a hundred fold.
"But the President, happily, is
not built that way. He will not
drag a great international ques
tion of this kind into the mire
of partisan; politics The Ameri
can people are behind President
Wilson to preserve peace and
peacefully to aid in establishing
a government in unhappy Mexi
co" :-i '
This is a sensible deliverance.
Mr. Stone's statement that the
chances of the President's re-elee
tion would be grealy increased in
case of war will be admitted, for
in case of war political partisan
ship is greatly modified and the
issue in the main is one of stand
ing by thVbead of the govern
ment against the foreigner. .s a
political matter, therefore, Mr.
Wilson would be helped bv inter
vention in Mexico, But believ
ing that the President will not
resort to armed intervention in
Mexico which he will not except
as a last resort the congres
sional critics take that as an ex
cuse for criticism,.' The New York
Sun, an opponent of the admin
istration had this to say with
reference to the resentment fol-
lowing the Mexican affair:
. ''All the more reason therefore
why the administration should
keep its head. All the more rea
son why .Congress, which hps
something to say about the mat
ter should Remain cool and co
operative with the President to
find an honorable and effective
way out of the difficulty, if it is
possiblo short intervention Does
; it need to be demonstrated that
the design of those who commit
ted the outrage was to discredit
Carranzaand percipitato inter
vention? We think not.. Repeat-
edly has General villa charged
. the administration with desert'
v ing him; and there have been ru
Witch Tear Smizi.
There is trouble enough in the
world without sneering more
trouble into it. Every time voa
sneeze while you have the grip or
a cold, several million cold or
grip microbes are sent flying
out into the air which other peo
ple must breathe. So the New
York health authorities are cir
culating a card bearing this ea
sily remembered couplet:
"Cover up yoaroough and sneer;
K you don't, you'll spread disease.'
If is is easy to remember to cov
er up the coughs and sneezes.
The old idea was to teach this
little act of decent thoughtful-
ness as a simple matter of good
breeding. But now the health ex
perts want everybody to know
that it is more than that It
means preventing the spread ot
discomfort, disease and possible
death. For grip and colds in A-
merica are almost, if not quite,
our deadliest plague.
bis is why school children,
passengers on elevated trains
and others have been receiving
wholesale this little bit f practi
cal poetry. Don't forgetit. When
that mischievous titillian begins
back of your nose, reach f o r
your handkerchief. And instead
of scattering: microbes scatter
this advice:
"Cover op your cough and sneeze:
If yon don't you'll ipread disease."
In the prevalent epidemic of in
fluenza, there is hardly a commu
nity that is free from its attacks.
Fortunately its assaults can be
guarded against and virulently
modified. In these changeful win
try days, with ajurapmgtemper-
ature ana alternate wet and dry
weather, sufficiently warm cloth
ing is a first necessity. Doctors
suggest care in keeping the feet
dry, the avoidance of over-heat
ed rooms, a moderate diet, and
absolute abstinence from alco
holic drinks. Perhaps one of the
beet safeguards against grip is
not to worry about it. A case of
"nerves" is more likely to .invite
it than not, all other things be
ing equal. Keep your head cool,
your feet warm and dry, and go
about your business as cheerful
ly as you can, and the danger
ii i i .
win oe reuucea to a minimum.

Old Caranza may be little bet
ter than some of those opposing
him, but he has the best thing in
sight offered the best hoe for
the restoration of order and eta
ble government in Mexico. Wheth
er he can succeed is. to be demon
strated, but it is a fact that since
the recognit ion of his defacto gov
ernment there are more indica
tions of peace in Mexico than at
any time for five years; and Ca
ranza should have the moral
support of this country until it is
demonstrated that he is a fail'
ure. It should be apparent to
anybody, as the New York Sun
points out. that the Mexican
massacre was for tho double pur
pose of showing the hatred o!
Villa and his followers for Amer
icans and to discredit Carranza:
and if we turn on Caranza before
he has had full opportunity to
show what he can do in Mexico
we will be aiding the very men
who planned and executed the
American lnassacie and carymg
out one of the purposes they had
in view when they committed the
crime. Statesville Landmark.
Littir Froa.liitliU, I. T
Editor Democrat: If you will
spare me a little space in your
paper, I will write a letter about
the Hawaiian Islands as there are
very few people in Watauga who
know anything much of the trop
ical countries from personal ob
servation. Honolula is the capital 1 of the
Hawaiian Island, while there are
several others of the islands that
are much larger than this one.
Honolulu is a large city, having
one hundred thousand popula
tion. -
There are several other nice
cities but not so large, . This is
land goes by the name of Oahu,
and the government has the ar
ray stationed here. There are sev
eral army posts and forces on
the island. Schofleld barracks is
the largest post that belongs to
the United States. There are four
regiments hew, the First Infan
try, Twenty-fifth Infantry, First
ield Artillery and Fourth Cav
alry are stationed at Schofleld.
There are fourteen thousand
soldiers stationed here, and to
see all the, regiments together
marching through the ?'iarade
grounds" would make you think
of the Army.
This is the finest climate in the
world. The temperature does not
change a great deal.. It is just as
warm in the winter months as in
the summer time. Gardens and
flowers are growing here uow the
same as they do in Watauga in
July. The principal crops here
are rice, sugar, coffee, cocoanute
pine apples and lots of other
hings. Vegetation stays green
here the year round.
There are not very many A-
merican people here.. The coun
try is full of Chinese, Japs and
Canakas. Canakas are the na
tives of the islands.
I would also-like to write of
my trip from the time I left Wa
tauga until I reached here, but
fear you have not space in your
paper, l will not write about
this now.
Best wishes to all. ' .

Charlotte Observer.
Colonel Bryan contributes 14
signed editorials to the January
number of the Commoner, to say
nothing of one of tbe CO speacbes
he delivered in Ohio between Oc
tober 25 and 30 on prohibition.
Almost the entire space of the
paper is given over to argument
of the Bryan kind against pre
paredness, and the Colonel still
invokes his readers to "write,
write now, write often," to the
members of Congress in protest
against a big army and a big
Navy against what the Presi
dent has declared to be "the par
amont issue." He arraigns Prvs
ident Wilson for what he consid
ers a lack of faith in the Demo
crats in Congress. He does not
think it is fair for the President
"to ignore the Democratic ma
jority iu both Houses and ask
Republicans to help him force
his views on his own party."
Of course President Wilson has
no intention of doing anything
of the kind, but how could he af
ford to ignore Republican aid in
a iratter so momentous to the
welfare of the country? On an
issue so important would Col.
Bryan draw party lines and im
peril the safety of the Nation
rather than accept the help that
patriotic members of the Repub
lican party were anxious and
ready to extend? We believe
that is the very sort of a Presi
dent Colonel Bryan would make
confronted with an issue of the
kind that has faced President
Wilson, he would be inclined
to put party above country.
Colonel William Bryan arraigns
resident Wilson for supporting
a . military and naval policy
which the leading Republicans
'avored before the war. but which
the Democratic party has op
posed." It is strange that a man
of Col. Bryan's renown should in
sist in childish argument of that
sort. At the time the Democrats
"were opposed" to the policy fa
vored by the. Republicans there
was no European war either
threatening or thought of. The
people know how conditions
have changed and how circum
stances have altered the case. Be
cause the Democrats may have
at one time opposed the policy
now advocated is no reason why
they should blindly persist in an
opposition that, if justified then,
cannot, of a certainty, bo justifi
ed now. Colonel Bryan further
contends that all those Congress
men he charges the President
with discrediting, maybe candi
dates for re election, "and their
chances will be affected . by their
action on preparedness." And
there you have it. ' A Congress
man must not vote from a sense
of his duty to the country, but
must shape his actions and his
votes with a vjew to his re-elec
tion " Are we to mler that were
Colonel Bryan President he' would
not press on tne Democrats in
Congress any issue through the
passage of which their return to
Congress would be imperiled? It
would seem so. . With Col. Tom
Pence we can repeat with renew
ed fervor, "Thank God for Wil
son!" )

Chicago Dispatch.
Progressive party generals
who participated in the Nation
al Committee conference here last
Tuesday and who joined in re
questing the Republican steam
roiler marshals to prepare the
"fatted calf," have three presi
dential possibilities in view, one
of them will be satisfactory to
them.
Some of the details of the ses
sion were learned from inside
sources todav. They are in the
order of their preference:
Theodore Roosevelt.
Justice Hughes, of theSuprerae
Court.
Gov. McCall of Massachusets.
Senator Lawrence Y. Sherman
could be nominated by the Re
publicans without entirely redu
cing the entente cordiale to a
mere scrap of paper. The Illinois
'.favorite son" labored cheek by
jowl with Colonel Kooseveit in
1912, up to the time that the
steam roller flattened out the
Roosevelt men. Then he elected
to stand with his party and in
refusing to follow the progres in
the campaign incurred the dis
pleasure of Col. Roosevelt.
Col. Roosevelt, the delegates
said, was their first choice and to
nominate him in the Republican
convention, they said, would
bend theirenergies. It was ascer
tained that the entire personnel
of the true blue Roosevelt en
tourage will improve from now
on. with an elaborate plan that
contemplates stampeding the
Republican convention for him.
The second choice of the Moos-
ers, according to the undercur
rent gossip during the recent
conference, is Justice Charles Ev
ans Hughes of the United States
Supreme Court- His nomination
also would cement the reunion of
the parties and do it sompletely,
they said.
Should Roosevelt and Hughes
be eliminated then they would
not make a wry face if Governor
McCall of Massachusetts should
be nominated.
The McCall boom was given a
resh impetus in the week's con-
ierences staged by George W.
erkins. In tho recent guberna
torial scrap in the old Hay State
it is estimated that fully 75 per
cent of the Progressives who vo
ted for Roosevelt in 1912 got be
hint McCall. This was achieved
largely by McCall and his mana
gers incorporating in their plat-
brm practically all of the funda
mental pronouncements carried
in the itooseveic covenant) oi
