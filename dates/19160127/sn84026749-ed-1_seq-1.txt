Civilians While They Were

Three United States army officers are under arrest
and face a court-martial as the result of the sensational raid
of fifteen troopers across the Mexican border yesterday.
In a desperate attempt to rescue two of their com
rades, who had been captured by armed Mexicans, the
American soldiers crossed the Rio Grande, a technical in
vasion of the neighboring republic.
Formal representations will be sent to General Car
ranza demanding the immediate return of the two soldiers
captured on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande, opposite
Mercedes, Texas.
With the representations, it is understood, will be
sent a statement advising the head)f the Mexican cle facto

commanding thcexpedition of fifteen American troopers
who dashed across the border in vain pursuit of the cap

Coincident with these startling developments here,

of President Wilson's policy toward Mexico in reply to their

With his keynote of "justice without aggression,"
Wilson declared tht he was committed to the policy of
allowing Mexico to work out her own affairs.
"Live and let live," he declared, "is a homely phrase,
but the basis of existence."

The President's address was in reply
to an earnest expression of apprecia

from Washington, subordinate offlcla's

done the offense. They declare that the
American troops along the border have
beoti for so long subjected to wanton
attacks and Insults from the Mexican
side that It was too much to expect
them to sit Idly by while the Mexicans
made off with the Americans. In this
connection attention is called to the
fact that the two troopers were Strip

also to the fact that the last time an
American trooper was captured on the
Mexican side he was tortured and kill
