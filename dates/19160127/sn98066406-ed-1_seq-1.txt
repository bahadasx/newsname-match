Work of County Agriculturist
The most important event in the af
fairs of last week was the meeting at
this otlice on Monday for the purpose
of completing the organization of the
Cow Testing Association. Otlicers were
elected, the route for the tester planned
and business matters of the association
arranged. Nearly all of the members
were present and all were very enthus
iastic over the work and anxious to
get it started at an early date. It was
voted to name the organization the St.
Clair County Cow Testing Association
No. 1. Lester Cole of Jeddo was elect
ed president and Charles Rabcock of
Port Huron, secretary and treasurer,
Mr. II. it. Hale of Caledonia, Mich.,
was employed as tester for the lirst
year, beginning February 1st.
Four days of the week were occupied
in assistine with the farmers' one-week
school at New Haven for the Agricul
tural College. A limited amount of
school and Institute work it occasion
ally required by the State of a County
Agent outside of his own county, and
these four days at New Haven together
with one day at Croswell February 7th
probably constitute the greater portion
of the outside work done this year.
Up to the present time it has been
possible to arrange for only one of
these schools iu St. Clair county. This
will be held at the Gleaners' hall in
China township from Jan. 31st to Feb.
4th. The three lines of work taken up
will be dairying, farm crops and home
economics. Mr. li. P. Robinson, Sagi
naw County Agent, will assist in the
work in farm crops, and Miss Paulina
Raven, extension lecturer for the Agri
cultural College at East Lansing, will
conduct the work in home economics.
A number of interesting booklets en
titled "The Tree Planter's Gulde,"have
been received from the Michigan Agri
cultural College for fre distribution,
and the same can be had by applying
at this otlice.
The St. Clair County Farmers' Fed
eration has decided to hold another
series of farmers' institutes during the
wek beginning February 14th. It is
planned to call these meetings at places
that were not reached by the institutes
held during the early part of this
month, and the dtes and programs
will be announced In the near future.
