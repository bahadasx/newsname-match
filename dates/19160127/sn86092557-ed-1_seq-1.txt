UN OPPOSES
AMENDMENT FOR
WOMEN'S VOTES
# ??
Tells Congressional Union
Suffrage is a Matter for
the States.
(By Associated Press)
NEW YORK, Jan. 27?President
Wilson refused today to support the
movement tor an. amendment to the
Federal constitution giving woman's
suffrage. He spoke briefly to 200
i members of the Congressional Union
I for suffrage and told them he felt the
suffrage question should be dealt with
by the individual states.
The President received the suffra
gists after they bad, waited for him for
more than an hour in the Waldorf As
toria which he made headquarters on
his arrival here this morning prepar
ed to make two or three addresses dur
ing the day.
Efforts made by Mrs: Mary Beard,
wife of the Columbia University pro
fessor, to cross examine the Presi
dent on his position met with failure.
He refused courteously to reply to her
query. The President apologized to
the women for not seeing them earlier,
but told them he had been at work
since arriving In New York.
He added that "It may be that my
mind works slowly but I have always
thought that there were things which
should be built slowly and therefore
made more lasting. I may be a little
old in fashion in the view that the
suffrage question - should be handled
by the states."
President Wilson arrived'hiere at 6
A, M. today to face a- program calling
for a reception for clergymen', the de
livery of addresses before two busi
ness organizations and the probability
that he would'.be interviewed by 200
women, seeking his aproval of a suff
rage amendment to. the Constitution
and by a delegatlon>,o? German-Am
ericans who want him to persuade the
British government to permit the ship
ment of milk from America for babies'
in Germany.
