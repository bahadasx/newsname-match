ANOTHEB HAUL OF BOOZE
Some time ago Sheriff Simmons re
ceived a tip that Milo Andrus and a
companion, of Firth, had gone to Og
den with a new Buick car for a load
of booze, and that the alleged illegal
venders of wet goods might receive a
legal welcome home he spent several
long, weary hours at the Blackfoot
bridge in the cold and snow. Tuesday
night his watchful waiting brought re
sults, for what they were looking foe
arrived in sight, and when its oc
cupants saw that they were about to
be captured they hit a speed that al
most run over the sheriff and his dep
uty. Unfortunately for the transgres
sors, their auto took a side tack which
put it out of commission, when its oc
cupants made for the depot on foot,
leaving the injured car for the sheriff.
The officers followed the pair of sup
posed bootleggers'to the depot and cap
tured Milo Andrus, his partner escap
Sun-jing at that time. Mr. Andrus called
for Attorney Beebç who arranged for
his release, but the booze and the auto
were taken in charge by the officers
who will take steps to have them both
confiscated. The load of liquor con
fisted of two cases of whiskey, or 502
pints, which are worth at the bootleg

No Immédiat? Danger of
Land Office Removal.
The reported efforts that have for
some time been made by the citizens of
Idaho Falls and Pocatello to have the
United States land office removed to
their respective cities, have not been
generally known, but when a few of
the wise ones learned that Fred Kiefer
has been at the local land office the
past few weeks gathering data for an
application of its removal to Idaho
Falls, they immediately got busy to do
even thing possible to frustrate the polit
ical selfish scheme. Saturday morning
D. II. Biethan and D. H. MacCosham,
Frank Berryman and others circulated
among the business men and citizens
and called a meeting in the afternoon
■to protest against the designs of our
neighboring cities At 3 o'clock about
' forty interested citizens met at the K.
jof P. hall and called a meeting to take
. steps to protect their city 's interest,
I and the meeting was caled to order by
jll. D. MacCosham who nominated Ernest
jPiearson for chairman which nomination
was unanimously carried. After the se
lection of Hamilton Wright for secre
tary, the chairman called on each and
every citizen present for their opinion
as to the proper and most effective
course to pursue in order to prevent the
attempted removal of so valuable an
adjunct to Blackfoot as the land office.
Mr. MacCosham suggested that every
resident of this city having its interest
at heart write a latter to one of our
congressmen in opposition to removal.
Mr. Biethan thought the suggestion
very gerv good, but as he stated that
he did not believe that a sufficient num
ber to do any good would write the
proposed letters, he suggested that a
petition be circulated with all the prn
testsfuts possible and sent to bur con
gressman. Some thought that a per
sonal representative should be sent to
Washington to intercede in our behalf.
A suggestion was made that a commit
tee be selected from those present with
CAPT. DAVIS GETS AUDIENCE
Captain E. G. Davis, a native son and
a Boise attorney, the first campaigner
of the approaching state election, was
welcomed at Blackfoot last night by a
fairly good audience, most of whom
seemed to have been favorably im
pressed with his ideas of what should
constitute the character and conduct of
a gubernatorial candidate. There were
not a few who thought him too angelic,
from his own introduction, for political
office in Idaho, where no governor lias
been credited with having reached the
standards of purity and honesty that lie
says should be required by the voters.
All agreed with him that the high taxes
were due to incompetent and lazy pub
lic servants and sinecures, all of which
he promised to eliminate if elected. J.
O. Morgan, our worthy townsman,
speaks very highly of Captain Davis,
who was in his employ a quarter of a
century ago as sheep camp tender. Hon.
P. G. Johnson, who lias known him in
private and political life, also gives
him credit for being honorable and
honest, two lonely but only necessary
virtues to make a good governor,
and give the state of Idaho an honest,
economical administration.
Captain Davis is a retired army
captain. He is a graduate of West
Point and later was an instructor of
law and history there. Following re
tirement because of injury to his foot,
he returned to his home in Idaho, was
eleeted to the legislature and served
through one session and a session extra
ordinary, after which he settled in
Boise, became private secretary to Gov
ernor Haines, after he had served as
secrçtary to the state central commit
tee, and later was assistant to the pres
ent attorney general during the last ad
ministration

full power to act as to the best course
to pursue. A motion finally prevailed
that Chairman Pearson select a commit
tee of three to investigate the present
status of the removal attempt, and to
take what steps they say proper to
frustrate it, anil to report their work
at a meeting to be called Tuesday af
ternoon at 4 o'clock. The chairman
after the meeting adjourned appoint
ed Hon. P. G. Johnson, Mayor Peek
and Hamilton Wright. Those present
were: D. H. Biethan, H. I). MacCos

At the meeting Tuesday afternoon
only about a dozen citizens were pres
ent, and those present regretted very
much that the attendance was so small.
Mr. Wright verbially reported thut the
committee had written their congres
sional representatives, all of whom ad
vised that Idaho Falls nor Pocata'lj
had made no application for the re
moval of the land office to either
the general land office or the secretary
of the interior as yet. With the as
sistance of several attaches of the local
land office, the committee found that
the Blackfoot land office was in al
most the exact center of the land dis
trict, and that for the years 1913, 1914
and 1915, there had been 3833 appli
cations for land north of the base line,
and 5868 south of it, wliiéh gave the
JRftckfoot land office GO'/•> per cent of the
filings in these years. This date the
committee contends is conclusive that
the present location of the land office
in this district is more convenient to
entrymen than either Pocatello or Ida
ho Falls.
