i PAPER MILL IS
MAKING PU.LP
And (ontainer Board Will
Be Made Within The
Next Few Days
OEMAND FOR PODOUCT GREAIT
And Bogalusa's Million
Dollar Mill Run Full
Blast
The Louisiana Fibre Boa d Co.
will begin the operation of their
million dollar plant some time dur
ing the coming week. For the past
few days the pulp department has
been working in perfect condition
and just as soon as enough pulp is
on-hand to start making the con
tainer board the other department
of the mill will also begin operation.
It is estimated that a run of seven
to ten days of the pulp department
will be required before the work
starts in the other department. The
pulp made from yellow pine is said
to be unexcelled and the machinery
is working perfectly.
Gen. Mgr. Wood who left Satur
day for Havana, is expected to
return to Bogalusa the early part of
next week and will remain for a
few days to see the mill making the
container board.
The mill represents an invest
ment of about one million dollars
and will give steady employment
to 200 or more men. The demand
for the product is good and indica
tions point to the fact that the mill
will not only be kept running full
blast but they will' be unable to
keep up with their orders. It is
stated that the first mon&'s output
has already been sold.
ELKS TO OHOANIlE
FINE _LOfE IRE
Meeting Will Be fHeld At

Early Date
Bogalusa is soon to have a lodge
of Elks and active work will start
within the next few days to organ
ize the lodge. There are already a
score of Elks in Bogalusa, belonging
to lodges through the country, and
the first step towards securing the
lodge will be a meeting of these
Elks. The meeting will will be held
at the Pine Tree Inn and if possible,
District Deputy Herman Michel, of
New Orleans, will attend the meet
ing. Those who are members of the
order are requested to send their
names and the lodge to which they
belonw to Clyde S. Moss at the
Enterprise office at once. The social
and charity features of this organ
ization are to well known to require
any comment and it is believed that
the Bogalusa lodge, when organized,
will be a credit to the organization.
Several plans and important
matters will be discussed at the first
meeting and it is important that all
Elks be present.
Pine Tree lasI Dance
The complimentary dance given by
the Pine Tree Inn Saturday evening
was in keeping with the standard

of the most enjoyable events in the
history of Bogalusa. Mr. and Mrs.
G. A. Townsend lead the Grand
March, which was pronounced as
one of the best ever witnessed here.
Music was furnished by Faber's
Orchestra. Besides a large number
of Bogalusa people in attendance,
there were several out of town
guests.
