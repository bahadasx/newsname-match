SCHOOL NOTES
Last week was our "judg
ment" week, when we were
'weighed in the balance" but
were not found wanting."
Nearly all of us passed our ex
aminations successfully and sev
eral made very creditable grades.
Those who made hundreds
were: Harry Richards, Marshal
Maxwell, Mabel Hine, Ralph
Epler and Johnnie Shirley. These
made hundreds only in certain
subjects, and not in everything.
Some who were not here for
our first examinations, and were
being retained in certain sub
jects, passed off those subjects
and are now going on in civil
government, etc.
Mary Hays, who has been
visiting in Colorado, has returned
at last. We are glad to have hér
back again.
Dorothy Bowman, who has
been' out for two months be
cause of sickness, has returned.
We are glad to have her again.
May Booth is being entertained
with the grip this week. Our
sympathy goes out to her.
Play ground activities are al
most dead this week because of
snow, ice and water. There is
such a great difference in school
life without play. We miss it al
most as much as we miss Mau
rine. We are looking forward to a
basket ball game between our
boys and Silverton. The chal
lenge has been given us and of
course we snail accept it. we
hope to play it as soon as the
weather will permit, and we hope
to play it at Estancia.. All of
our school friends are invited to
come to see the game when
played.
Two new pupils in the primary
room this week.
We are having better attend
ance among the little folks this
week than last.
It seems that the eighth grade
is spending some time studying
matrimony as well as war and
other things, and it has evident
ly had its effect. We were all
very much surprised to learn of
the marriage of Maurine Max
well and C. P. Means on last
Sunday, January 23rd, and all
join in wishing them - a long,
prosperous end happy life.
T
A meeting was held Tuesday
evening to discuss tho matter of
retaining the county agent in
this county.
The meeting was well attend
ed considering bad walking.
The matter was discussed in
all its angles, and the sentiment
was unanimously in favor of re
taining thé county agent if there
is a possible way to do it.
It seems that there is a law
which prohibits the county com
missioners from contracting
debts or obligntions which the
funds to be raised by taxation
for the current year will not be
sufficient to pay, and the com -
missioners nave expressed a
doubt as to whether the taxes
for this year will be sufficient to
pay the county's share on the
county agent charge after meet
ing the expenses provided for by
law. The matter is to come up
again at the meeting of the com
missioners to be held February
18th, and the clerk was instruct
ed to prepare an estimate of the
county's probable expenses for
the year, so that it will be pos
sible to judge on this point.
It was decided to attempt to
get pledges of subscriptions to
ward the county agent expense,
so that in case it is found that
the county may be short of funds
to meet the expense, or part of
it, the deficiency may be made
good in this way.
A committee was appointed
consisting of Willie Elgin, chair
man, Cleofes Romero, Joe Peter
son, J. L. Stubblefield and Dr,
Amble, to solicit subscriptions in
Estancia and vicinity. This
committee was also instructed to
appoint a secretary to correspond
with people in other parts of the
county in an effort to secure
their co-operation.
Whatever is done must be done
promptly, as it will be necessary
to be prepared to say what can
be done at the commissioners'
meeting on February 18th.
In our opinion it would be a
great pity to part with a county
agent just when the work is get
ting fairly under way.' Besides
curtailing our development for
the immediate future, it would
mean that the money so far spent
is largely wasted, as the work so
far has been largely of a pre
paratory nature.
Also, it should be remembered
that the federal government con
tributes half the expense, and
this, if not spent in Torrance
county will be spent in some oth
er county, and the people of Tor
rance 'county will have to pay
their share of it just the same
MARRIED
A pretty wedding was cele
brated at the ranch home of Mr.
and Mrs- Robert N. Maxwell,
Sunday afternoon, January 23,
1916, at 2 o'clock, when their
daughter, Maurine, became the
bride of Mr. Columbus P. Means
of Estancia,
Promptly at the appointed hour
the contracting parties entered
the parlor and presented them
selves before the Rev. B. W.
Means, the father of the groom,
who in a touching, tender cere
mony made them husband and
wife and invoked divine bless
ing upbn tbe union.
After receiving the congratu
lations of the relatives, who
were the only guests, a dainty
luncheon was served.
Both bride and groom have
grown up in this vicinity, where
they are well known and es
teemed as among the best young
people of the community.
We join with the many friends
in wishing the young couple a
happy and prosperous life
Mrs. Frank Means and baby re
turned to their home in Santa Fe
Tuesday morning, after a visit

who had been ill from an opera
tion for appendicitis.
W. E. Johnstor, of Snyder,
Texas, came in about; cen days
' ago with his family and a car of
household goods and stock, and
is stopping temporarily on the
Simmons place, just north of
town. Mr. Johnston wants to
try out the country before locat
ing permanently, and to that end
wants to rent a place with about
seventy-five acres in cultivation.

Acasio Gallegos of Torreón has
been commissioned a notary pub
lic, as his also Thomas B. Rap
koch of Estancia, who is deputy
county clerk. Mr. Rapkoch's
notarial commission will prove a
convenience for those who want
the services of a notary while at
the court house. It will be a
convenience also for the people
at Torreón to have a notary who
speaks and writes both languages
fluently.
G. H. Van Stone has quit his
job as secretary of the Santa Fe
chamber of commerce. His suc
cessor is Willard E. Holt. Speak
ing of Mr. Van Stone's work the
New Mexican says:
"The New Mexican believes
Mr. Van Stone is one 'of the best,
hardest working and most effi
cient publicity men and boosters
in the state. ' As . time goes on
the value of his services to this
community will be appreciated
more and more. "
Considerable agitation íb going
on now in regard to .building an
other school building in this dis
trict, or remodeling and adding
to the present one. It is but a
matter of a year or two when
this district must install a full
high school course. This will be
necessary for the pupils now
here, and doubly necessary to
get others to come. If it is ex
pected that the community is to
grow by the coming of new fami
lies, there must be a high school,
because people will not locate
where school facilities are lack
ing. It is useless to multiply
words on this subject. Any
thinking person must know that
what is here said is true.

Loan company perfected its or
ganization at the first annual
