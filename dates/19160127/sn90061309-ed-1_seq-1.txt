on our various occupation I shall
feel amply repaid, no matter what
personal sacrifices I shall have to
make to achieve that end, and
I ask every loyal and patriotic
jitizen of Monroe City to join with
Tie and support and help me in
this endeavor It is not necessary
lor me to call attention to the im
provements in Monroe City that
have been made in just the last
two years, but I firmly believe that
with the building of the new Burl

beginning of an era of expansion

the following statement printed in
t-api' d letters We Must Forget
All Factional Differences And
Work Together For The Good Of
MONROE CITY. Otherwise this
great opportunity will be wasted.
And right here is a good place
for me to state the principles that
will govern me in my race for
Mayor and in the conduct of my
duties of the office should I b hon
ored with it. I am not the candi
date of any faction, nor will I ever
recognize any faction. Equal rights
to all, regardless of politics, or any
other question, and absolutely no
special privileges to any faction or
individual is my Motto.
And I want to state as positively
and emphatically as I can make it
I refuse to recognize any "wet" or
'drv" issue in the enmnnk'n for

personal matter such as this, or to
put it briefly, "wets" and 'drys"
look exactly alike to tne.
I cannot close without paying u
tribute to our retiring Mayor, Mr. J.
S.Scott. He has served our inter
ests faithfully during the most dif
ficult period in the history of our
city and we owe him a debt of
gratitude for the financial and ex
ecutive ability he has shown in
dealing with the large problems
arising during his administration,

prevent rather than cure disease:
how this principle has affected city
health departments: its application
to tire departments.
Fire prevention: - methods to be
followed: municipal zones with
rules regarding property; building
code (fire-proofing, fire-escapes,
etc.): means of extinguishing fires
at their inception; inspection (care
less storage of rubbish, dangerous
smoking, etc.); education of the
public regarding fire waste and fire
danger (regular and coalitions in
formation,: what health depart
ments do in the same way to pre
vent the propagation of disease
through ignorance.
Local fire department: its cost;
efforts to prevent the occurrence of
fires: possible improvements.
Fire hazard .in local school:
construction exits, fire escapes, drill
heat appliances, rubbish in base
ment; interest shown by teacher,
parents or department in the ques
tion of prevention.
