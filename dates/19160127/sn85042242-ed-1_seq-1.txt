All But Few Counties in State
Were Represented at Meet­
ing Yesterday.
COMMITTEE APPOINTED
TO FACILITATE WORK
New State Tax Schedule Prepar­
ed by Auditor Jorgenson Is
Talked Over.
A meeting of the county auditors
of the state, the state board of equal
ization and the tax commission was
held in the office of Acting Governor
Fraine yesterday, for the purpose of
settling a number of questions rela­
tive to the manner in which property
in the state shall be assessed.
Practically every county in the
state was represented, either by the
county auditor or by one of the coun­
ty commisisoners.
The object' of the meeting was to
get the ideas of the county officers
on the new tax schedule as prepared
by State Auditor Carl O. Jorgenson.
The schedule is patterned after the
Minnesota schedule, but has ouly 48
property classifications, where the
Minnesota schedule has 01. The num­
ber of valuation columns, however,
have been increased from 28 on la*t
year's schedule to 05
n'i
the present:
schedule. The schedule was highly
commendcd by Prof. Boyle of the
state university, an expert on taxa­
tion and assessment.
Arriving At Values.
The question of arriving at a per­
centage of valuation, for assessing
property, is also one which will be
taken up at the meeting, but was
not touched on yesterday. A list of
instructions for assessors will also be
prepared.
Yesterday's session was featured
with a general discussion by those
present on taxing,matters in general.
J. H. Riley, county commissioner of
Burleigh county, amused those, pre^
ent, when "lie explained how the far­
mers in his township tried to dodge
taxation. A number of them had pigs
which Were' born after April 1. Mr.
Riley insisted on assessing the pigs.
Former Auditor Addison Leech of
Cass county took issue on the' ques­
tion with Mr. Riley and informed him
that under the law he had absolutely
no right to assess stock born after
April 1. Mr. Riley's general lack of
knowledge on all matters pertaining
to the work of an assessor was the
source of much amusement' to those
in attendance at the meeting yester­
day.
Appoint Committee.
The entire afternoon was taken up
with general discussion and little
of importance was accomplished, ow­
ing to the numerous views on the va­
rious subjects.
A committee was then appointed,
consisting of Tax Commissioners

Declares Her Husband Threaten­
ed to Kill Her Several
Times.
'Providence, ill. 1., Jan. 20.—-Mrs.
Elizabeth F. MJohr, on trial with two
negroes on the charge of murdering
her husband, Dr. C. Franklin 'Mohr,
asserted on the witness stand today
that she loved her husband and was
also desirous of effecting a reconcili­
ation with him. She denied unequiv­
ocally that she ever plotted to have
him killed.
The accused widow told her story
in a very low voice, and appeared to
be cool and collected. Once or twice
.while telling of sqme particular irri­
gated turn in her'dotnestic troubles,
she seemed on the verge o£ breaking
down, but each time she regained
control of herself.
In answer to the question put to
her by her counsel, the witness said
that her husband had been cruel and
ibusive, but that she loved him not­
withstanding his treatment. She
identified a letter she said she had
received from him while at the New­
port home in the fall of 1913, in
which the doctor said:
"I don't want anything around that
reminds me of you, and if you ever
put your foot in Providence again, I
will about kill you."
Mrs. Molir made the assertion that
Dr. Mohr wanted her to "get. out and
shift lor herself," and that he urged
her to go west and get a divorce, but
that she refused. Dr. Mohr threat
ened to kill her because she wouldn't
give him her jewelry, according to
her testimony.
Continuing, Mrs. Mohr said she re
ceived many beatings from her hus­
band, because of her attempt to keep
iMiss 'Emily 'Burger away from him.
She asserted that Dr. Molir was ad­
dicted to the use of liquor and drugs,
and while under their influence was
dangerous. She did not deny writing
letters tp Healis, Dr. iMohr's negro
chauffeur, while she was visiting the
doctor's relatives in McEwensville,
Pa., explaining that she wanted to
know what the doctor was doing
that he was her husband and she was
interested in what he did. She as­
serted that her correspondence with
Healis was not carried on in pursu­
ance of an intended plot to kill the
doctor.

Washington, Jan. 26.—Estimates
were given the senate military com­
mittee today by Brigadier General
Crozier, chief of ordnance, showing
that a plant costing $400,000,000, op­
erated by a force of 750,000 workmen,
would be required to manufacture
ammunition and war materials neces­
sary to keep an army of a million
men in the field and equip an addi­
tional million recruits.
Against Government Monopol1
General Crozier strongly disap­
proved any proposal for government'
monopoly of the manufacture of war
supplies, insisting that best results
could be accomplished by relying up­
on private establishments to supple­
ment the output of government,
plants in time of war.
Tentative Measure.
The committee received today from
Secretary Garrison a draft of -i. ten­
tative measure, -suggested by Chair­
man Chamberlain, which would pro­
vide for the authorization of the pro­
posed continental army in general

public and large private munition
plants of the United Slates are locat­

gress to foster development of pri­
vate plants in I he interior.

FORMER DEMANDS
Insists That China Settle Differ­
ences at Once Means Ja­
panese Dominance.
Washington, Jan. 2G.—Awaiting
confirmation from official sources as
a necessary preliminary to any action
by the United States, state depart­
ment officials were deeply interested
in the report today from London that
the Japanese government has revived
all of the demands upon China, in
eluded in the famous "Group 5" of the
list of proposals submitted to the Pe
kin government more than a year ago
for a permanent settlement of out­
standing issues between Japan and
China.
There is a conviction in official
circles here that any action at this
time likely to have results toward
warding off the new Japanese de­
mands must be taken by the United
States practically alone. With -wry
evidence of sympathetic interest by
the European entente allies in the at­
titude of opposition, assumed when
the proposals on the "Group 5" origi­
nally were submitted, it is believed
that none of these powers will be in
clined to take issue with Japan, at' a
moment when they are leaning heav
ily upon their Oriental ally, not only
for munitions of war, but for military
and naval protection in the Orient.
The very close study that has been
made in Washington of the proposals
embodied in "Group r" has only con
firmed officials in their original belief
-that if accepted in full by China
without protest from other nations,
they would lead not only to material
and industrial, but even political
domination of China by Japan.
While not prepared to make an is­
sue on that point, however, the state
department is convinced that the oth­
er provisions of "Group f" finally
would close to American commerce
and enterprise the open door in
China.

Washington, Jan. 2fi.—Prospects
for the passage of a government ship

bright by administration leaders.
They saw in conferences President
Wilson had today with Democrats
who opposed such a measure last
year indications that united support
for the revised proposal eventually
would be won.
The president continued today to
urge leading members of congress to
hasten action on important legisla­
tion. The president made it clear
that matters he hoped to see pushed
ahead of anything else were the fol­
lowing:
Measures On Program.
National defense measures, includ­
ing army reorganization and increas­
ed naval construction.
Construction of a merchant marine
designed to serve as a nafval auxiliary

OF ARMED BOATS
Washington, Jan. 2U.—Arrival at
New York today of the Italian steam­
er America, armed like the liner Ver­
ona, already at the same port, with
two guns mounted aft, may hasten
the decision of the United States gov­
ernment on the question of whether
there shall be a change in policy re­
garding the clearance from American
ports of merchant vessels armed for
defensive purpose.
Before news of the America's ap­
pearance reached here in press dis­
patches, the Austrian charge had
called at the state department to ask
what the United States intended to
do in the case of the Verona. A sim­
ilar inquiry was made by the charge
recently before the Italian steamship
Guiesspe Verdi sailed from New York
carrying guns mounted.
The Verdi was cleared after the
Italian government had given assur­
ances that her arms would be used
for defense only.
There have been intimation that
Austria is prepararing to inform the
United States that enemy merchant­
men mounting guns for any purpose
would be considered armed and
would be subject to an attack with­
out warning.

Washington, Jan. 2G.—President
Wilson today sent' a letter to Chair­

had withdrawn his opposition to the

ing creation of such a body. He
wrote frankly that he had changed
his mind because "all the circum­
stances of the world had changed."
Declaring that he had "no thought
whatever of a change in attitude to­
ward the so-called protection ques­

ed commission would have nothing to
do with the theories of policy, but
would be charged only with the duty
of seeking facts to guide congresB in

In another letter to Mr. Kitchin
