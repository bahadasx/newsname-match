FOR TARIFF BOARD
President Wilson Has a Plan
Nearly Ready for Submis
sion to Congress.
MAY DISCUSS IT IN MESSAGE
Measure Providing for Commission to
Be Introduced in Near Future
Necessary After War.
Washington, Jan. 21. Creation of a
tariff commission, it was Icarnt-d from
official sources tonight, lias been de
termined upon by the Wilson adminis
tration. A bill providing for such a
commission will be introduced in Con
gress in the near future, and President
Wilson may discuss the subject in a
message to congress.
The duties of the proposed commis
sion or board under the plan are un
derstood to have been agreed upon by'
administration leaders, and would be
to collect information regarding the
tariff and to coordinate aimllnr pow
ers now believed by President Wilson
to be held by existing government
bodies.
Would Safeguard U. S. Industry.
Aside from his belief that the tariff
always should be treated in scientific
fashion, the President has given con
sideration to the situation which will
follow the European war, and has been
urged by many of his advisers that
legislation will be necessary to safe
guard America's commercial and in
dustrial interests when that time
comes. In his last message to con
gress he said:
"Many conditions about which we
have repeatedly legislated are being
altered from decade to decade under
our more rapidly and more radically
in the days immediately ahead of us,
when peace has returned to the world
nnd nations of Europe once more take
up their tasks of commerce nnd indus
try with the energy of those who must
bestir themselves to build anew.
Must Keep Informed, He Says.
"Just what those changes will be
no one can certainly foresee, nor con
fidently predict. They are not calcu
lable, because there are no stable ele
ments in the problem. The most we
can do is to make certain that we
have the necessary instrumentalities
of information constantly at our serv
ice, no that we may be sure that we
know, exactly what we are dealing
with when we come, to act, if it should
be necessary for us to act at nil."
When former Governor Cox of Ohio
wrote to him some time ago suggest
ing that a tariff commission be creat
ed, the President replied:
"The full powers of a tariff commis
sion are already lodged In the exist
ing organs of the government; most of
them and really more than the former
commission had, In the bureau of for
eign and domestic commerce of the
Department, of Commerce and others
(powers of investigation, chiefly) in
the hands of the new federal trade
commission. "
