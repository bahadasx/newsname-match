prominent revolutionary leaders, was
Interviewed at Yunnar.fu by a cor
respondent representing the Peking

TangChl-yao is credited with hav
ing said: "Yunnan was selected for
the revolution because of Us location
beyond mountain defiles ' forming an
impregnable natural fortress. The
revolt could have been started in oth

that Japan is assisting the Yunnanese.
He said: We are receiving no as
sistance from Japan or any other for

(Aiorluted Prem CnrreaiHinlenr.)
Home, Italy, April 4. As the result
of a recent increase in the domestic
letter rate from three to four cents
and tlie withdrawal from the general
public of the privileges of sending
newspapers as second class matter,
the net Income of the Italian postal
service is being increased from thirty
to thirty-one millions a year, accord
ing to the minister of posts and tele
graphs, Vicenzo lliccio The surplus
is being used as a war revenue.
The sending of newspapers as sec
ond class matter by private persons
was discontinued to prevent the prac
tice of the Italian population of
smuggling letters inside of newspap
pers. The volume of military corre
spondence has reached 1,100,000 let
ters and post cards a day. While sol
diers at the front may send letters
free, their correspondents must pay
the regular postage.

The Turks also have met with an

. San Antonio, Texas, April Hi. It
was a fore of Carnur.a si Idjcrs who
engaged the little detachment of
American cavalry at l'arr.u Wednes
day ,ln u regularly organized uelion,
according tp a detailed report wi it
ten by Major Fratu IMmpknis and
forwarded to General Funafuti by
General Pershing.
Forty of the Mexican soldiers, in
cluding one major and ono civilian,
were killed by the retreating Ameri
cans. Tlie American casualties were
two killed and six, wounded, Includ
ing Major Tompkins. His wound was
slight.
Maior Tompkins' account of the ac
tion was received at General Ftin
ston's headquarters tonight and serv
ed to clarify General Pershing's re
port received yesterday, in which the
identity of tlie attacking force was
unstated and in which he left the in
ference that the cavalry was under
Colonel W. C. BroiJiM'
Tixsiiw Now Kufe.
The Americans now are north and
west of Parral, reinforced by a squad
ron of the Tenth, under Major Young,
accompanied by Colonel W. C. Brown i
and a picked squadron under Major
Robert L. Howze. Fear for their
safety Iiuh been dispelled by this re
port and by troop dispositions that
General Pershing has ordered, the
character of which (General Funston
did not wish to reveal.
Major Tompkins' story of the fight
Indicates lack of control over the
troops by the commanding officer of
the Parral garrison, General Lozuno,
and bitter antagonism by the public
and troops. The fighting took place
outside I'arral and was continued over
a route of eight miles to Santa Cruz
northeast of Parral on the railroad.
Americans Iti-lrcatcd.
General Funston said tonight that
while Major Tompkins undoubtedly
acted in accordance with his best
judgment in retreating, he regretted
that he had not made a stand on ac
count of the ill-effect the story will
have on the Mexican people, who nat
urally will regard the Incident as ai.
American defeat.
Major Tompkins arrived outside
Purral on the forenoon of April 12
with Troops M and K f the Thir
teenth cavalry. Reduced In number
the total of these two companies is
approximately 100 men. The report
that unarmed men went into Parral
appears to have been erroneous.
Major Tompkins admitted that ho did
march his small detachment quite
openly along the trail Into the city,
where they were met by General Lo
zano, who received them most grace
fully'. The civil authorities arrived
and joined in the courteous reception
of the major und his troops. The
Incident appeared to be progressing
without unpleasant features. General
Ixizano and the civil authorities dis-,
cussed with Major Tompkins the ques
tion nf camping sites, and the local
officials decided on one just outside
the city, to which jMuJnr Tompkins
was directed.
InviKil Inlo City.
Major Thompkins entered the town
upon the. Invitation of the officer
of the i'arral garrison. He slated
that the officer met him ten miles
from Parral, introduced himself and
urged him to accept the hospitality
of the military and civil authorities.
This fact, coupled with Major
Thompkins' report of the subsequent
attack, caused officers hero to ex
press the opinion that he and bis
men had been deliberately led Into
a trap, although perhaps not with
the knowledge of General Lozano,
commanding officer.
Attacked Troops.
Major Tompkins was preparing to
move out to the designated camp
when soldiers and civilians began to
throw stones and to shoot at the
Americans. Realizing that the action
was that of a mob of civilians and of
soldiers who had gotten beyond the
control of their officers, Major Tomp
kins made no stand, but retreated his
men without making resistance, to
wards the city limits. Shouting crowds
followed them, while stones and oc
casional shots fell among them, but
without doing great damuge.
It was ater noon when Tompkins
bd his men Into a defensive position
behind an embankment outside the
town. The mob respected the advant
age the Americans had taken but
within a brief time there appeared on
their flank a force of 300 Mexican
troops who began in military fashion
a formal attack.
Ordered to light Bandits Only.
Major Tompkins was still averse to
fighting in anything but a defensive
uuinner against this force, since every
officer who has entered Mexico with
the punitive force has had it Im
pressed upon him I hat clashes with
the troops of the de facto govern
ment must be avoided. Also it soon1

A retreat then was begun that was
ended only at Santa Cruz. The Mex

themselves with H rear guard action.

discussed the possibility of "passing

"The men who pull the throttle or

Villa is dead and his body, disin
terred some days after' his' luiilal, Is
in possession of the Carianrlsta
troops, according to it series of tele,
graphic messages received In Juarez
today by the Mexican officials.
For more than a week reports that
Villa had died from, wounds have
Ifeoii current both hero and in .lua
lez. Today's accounts were tlie most
circumstantial and apparently relia
ble yet received. They were accepted
with reserve by American officials, In
cluding General Bell, hut the Mexi
can officials expressed confidence n
their reliability. The messages, In
the order In which they were re
ceived, were as follows:
How News Caino In.
Tlie (lisp ilcher of tint Mexico
Northwestern railroad at Juurcz re
ported to General Gabriel Gaviia,
Carranza commander at Juarez, that
he had heard a conversation over
the telegraph wires to the effect that
Villa's body tviis in the hands of the
Carranelsta troops.
General Gavlra notified Consul
Andres Garcia here, who rushed
messages to the telegraph operators
nt Madera und Ciislliiilracblc, asking
for confirmation.
The Madera and Cusihulritchle op
erators answered confirming the re
port, und staling the body was being
taken to Chihuahua Cllv.
Body on Special Train.
The telegraph operator at San
Antonio, fifty miles west of Chihua
hua, telegraphed Consul Garcia that
Villa' s body was in possession of
Colonel Carlos Carranza, nephew of
General Carranza, who was taking It
on a special train to Chihuahua.
In reply to messages, telegrams
were sent to the Carranza generals
In the field, to officials In Mexico
City, Chihuahua and other points
asking confirmation, but no nn.sweis
have yet been received.
Apart from the telegrams sent here
there are some known facts which
have been pointed out by Mexican
officials us lending strong support to
the truth of the report that the ban
dit chief's career has been closed by
death- These facts are:
Villa Already III.
Villa has been suffering for more
than a year from a virulent form of
blond poisoning.
Ho was treated for this disease
while In Junrex by Pr. W. L. Brown,
one of the best physicians known in
Kl Paso.
Dr. Brown states that Ihe condition
of the bandit was such thut even a
minor wound would be fatal In ten
days unless treated promptly and
with the best medical skill and cure.
I'ndcr the most favorable conditions
such a wound would be of the gravest
character.
It is certain that If Vill.i was
wounded ho could not have com
manded anything but the. most primi
tive treatment.
Itlots in ( IlibllalilM.
Another message from Chihuahua
City received here today stating that
rioting had broken out there was re
garded ns in a measure confirmatory
of the bandit's death. Villa Is known
to have bad numerous sympathizers
among , the lower classes In the city
and it was considered probable that
their sympathy would take the form
of violence If they learned the body
of their hero was helng brought to
.Chihuahua to he exhibited us that or
a criminal.
Finally, and a point upon which
the greatest emphasis Is laid:
Nothing positive has been Known
of Villa since the battle at Guerrero
at which time the reports of his be
ing wounded were accepted by Gen
eral Pershing and other American
,f fleers. If b had continued soiitn.

have reached either Torreon or Du
riingo City, in which event some news
of bis movements would ulmost posl
lively have bijcome known.
How Grao Wnm Ixx-ated.
Only one message was received I't
Tun res today giving any details of
the supposed finding of Villa's body.
This message was unofficial and was
sent to a private party. According
to It, Villa's death and burial wero
revealed t,y a former colonel of thn
bandit baud who has been captured
and was under sentence of death.
This colonel offered to show his cap
tors Villa's grave In return for his
life, He led a detschiuent- of Car
ranza soldiers under Ihe command
of Colonel Cazos.
The Villista officer took the Cor
ranza soldiers to San Francisco Bor
ja, thirty miles south of Culsl, and
a, little to the west of Satevo. When
Ihe body was exhumed, messages re
ceived here stated, ft was found that
tlie left leg was 111 a gangrenous con
dition and that there was a gunshot
wound through the .knee mud tho
ankle was broken. ,
Garcia Believes Story,
Consul Garcia refused to commit
himself positively tonight us to
whether he accepted the story of Vil
la's death as true.
"In the absence of official Informa
tion," ho said, "I can not say that tho
story is absolutely true, but person
ally I consider the messages I have
received as reliable, I have sent h,
telegram to Governor Knrtqile of
Chihuahua to have the body of Villa
sent to Juarez, if it hus been found,
so that the Americans here can sat
isfy themselves as to the facts."
The attitude of Americnn officials
and army officials here ranged from
frank skepticism to watchful wailing.
General Bell admitted he was a
skeptic as did Consul F.dwards, in
Juarez, who said he hnd received ft
message from Chihuahua City early
today in which no mention of Villa
was made. On the other hand Gen
eral Gavlra and his staff accepted tho
story of Vllln's death ns true and ex
pressed tho highest gratification over
