PERSHING TO VIEW BODY
Snn Antonio, Texas, April 17.
Gonerul John J. Pershing has
left Cusihuirachic with ft caval
ry detachment to view the body
exhumed by Carlos Carranza,
and said to he the corpse of
Francisco Villa, it was learned
at army headquarters today. He
should be able to give General
Funston positive advices within
a few hours, unless the remains
are in such a condition that they
cannot be identified.
-
San Antonio, Texas. April 17. Lack
ing official confirmation of Francisco
Villa's reported death," General Funs
ten today ordered General Pershing to
rush a detachment to the mountains
west of l'nrral where the bandit chief
was said to have taken refuge.
Other troops were nastily fini.-bing
defensive works at Santa Cruz, to meet
any Carrnnzista move from Parral.
Alajor Howze was said to have re
ported Villa in the mountains follow
ing the clash in which the American
soldier Kirby was killed and two
wounded. Howze was making a detour
around Lnborja when he encountered
the Villistns. A sharp clash resulted.
The Yillistas casualties were not stated.
Shortly afterward ITowze's detach
ment of the Tenth cavalry entered Snn
ta Cru. where the Americans retreated
after Ktiving been trapped at Parral,
and aided them in repulsing a Carrnn
zista nttnek.
The official report of Major Tomp
kins who commanded Americans at the
Parral fighting, said he marched will
a small force quite openly to Tarral
and was conferring with constitution
alist leaders with regard to a camping
plnce when a mob of soldiers and civil
ians attacked his troops. The Ameri
cans fell back and took refuge behind
a railroad embankment.
This position, said Tompkins was
shortly flanked by 300 Carranzistas and
the Americans were obliged to continue
their retrent eight miles to Santa Cruz,
conducting a rearguard action all the
way. In their retreat, Tompkins said,
he believed they killed more than
.Mexicans. Two Americans we're killed
and six wounded, said Tompkins. The
wounded included Tompkins himself,
who was only slightly hurt.
'"leneral Funston wired officers at
Douglas to look up Dr. Wickman. whom
A'illa made prisoner for a month la.it
fall, (so that Wickman could treat him
"for n blood disease) and have him at
tempt to identify the body.
Funston is seeking others intimate
with Villa. It was indicated that Funs
ton hail faith in the reports of Villa's
death. Funston pointed out that the lo
cution of American troops under Ma
jor How.e was at La Borju near the
wene where it is stated the corpse wt.j
e'.humed, Howze did not state' when

.conference between representatives of
minority and majority bondholders in,
which nu unsuccessful attempt was

- London, April 17. The allies have
forced a new crisis in Athens with a
possibility that Greece may be thrust
into the war against its will. Over
riding all objections" the entente powers
are today transporting Serbian troops
overland by railroad from Cor'fiil to
Salonika. Australa and Germany pro-
tested that they would regard thia as a
deliberately unfriendly act if Greece
permitted it
French correspondents at Athens have
reported that King Constantine is in-
censed at the allies' action and may
attempt to halt it by force. Tho allies
did not want to transport the newly
equipped Serbian soldiers by water be
cause of submarine danger!.
It was suggested to Premier Skou
loudis that the troops be sent to Patras
by steamer and thence to Salonika by
rail. Skouloudis sounded out the Teu
tonic allies, which replied that hi coun
try would commit un unneutral act if
he acquiesced to the proposal. Skoti

Its Object As a Nation Is to
Serve and Better Balance
of the World
Washington. April 17. "America
will never fight merely Tor herself,''
said President W is, u t dey, nddres-ing
tho Duughtcrs of the American Revoiu
tionnssembled here. The audience sut
tensely silent under his words.
"The only excuse America can ever
have for asserting her physical force
will be to fight in the interest of hu
manity," the president continued.
"When America forgets human rights
she will have lost her title to her own
high traditions."
"America's birth is singular in that
no other nation was ever bom for the
purpose of serving the rest of the world
as much as itself. Tradition is a beau
tiful thing insofar as we live up to it.
If we forget the traditions of our fath
ers we will have become unconscious of
the things for which our country was
'founded."
In the meeting Mrs. Walter Reed, of
California, asked that nnti-preparedness
be represented at Wednesday night 's
preparedness meeting. President-General
Mrs. Story overruled the request.

various sources today, but American
army men arc anxious that his body be
identified by t inted States represen
tatives. "A train left Juarez for Chi

X bullet received in fighting nt Guer

war department in Mexico City, that,
with an escort of soldiers, he was tak
ing the-corpse to Chihuahua by rail.
Unless the corpse is mutilated or de

Advices received by the .Mexican war
department said that, following the bat
tle of Guerrero where Villa was hit,
his followers carried him to Tamos ichic
where a village doctor cut off his in
fected leg. Later he was carried bv
his men south to the village, of Ciisihuir
iachic, llil miles away, where he died, ac
cording to the reports. He was said to
have suffered greatly before expirini'.
With Villa's identity being kept sec
ret from the villagers, his followers
c.irricd him secretly away in the middle
of the night ami buried him in a lonely
Spot.
The advices went on to assert that a
member of the guard which escorted
Villa during his lost moments was cap
tured by Cnrrunzistns ami promised to
point out Villa's grave if his life was
spared. This, is wis said, was done.
Carlos superintended the work of dig
ging up tiie remains. He intends to
have the body publicly exhibited in
Chihuahua City.
Kioting reported nt Chihuahua, first
said to be ilue to excitement over Vil
la's rumored death, is now attributed
to the hunger of tho populace. Small
wages and famine prices induced by
I irge purchases "for the American expe
dition placed food beyond the reach of
many poor families. It was reported
that tiie riotinir nml Inntimr u.nu nnt ,n.
rected against American residents. Mes
sages suggested that the depreciated
value of Carranza currency hjd caused
a food shortage in the Carrnnzista gar
rison. Story Is Not Confirmed.
A number of news'pnpnrnien mid mo
tion picture operators desired to go
from Kl Paso to Chihuahua for tiio pur
pose of viewing the body reported to be
that of Villa, but Consul (I ireia refused
to give them the necessary documents,
and notified them that Carranza would
not be responsible for their safety.
Consul Garcia stated today " that
neither he nor General Gnvirn in Juar
ez had aay confirmation of the report
that Villa's body hud been recovered
or identified. Anyhow, they said, it
would be difficult' to establish the
body's identity on account of the
length of time it hud been buried and
owing to the character of the disease
from which it was reported Villa died.
"If Colonel Ci.rlos ( nrranza says t!ie
body is Villi's I will be satisfied,"
said Garcia. "Carranza knows him and
is dependable. If he says it is Villa I
will give no attention to contrary reports,''

Says Dorothy Arnold Was
Murdered and Body Buried
In a Cellar
Providence, R. I., April 17. Edward
Olenoris, an inmate of the state prison
here told police toduy he stood guard
while a pal buried the body of Dorothy
Arnold, missing heiress, in tho cellar
of a houso near West Point, officials
announced. They investigated his story.
He swore that the plot to dispose of the
girl originated in a Seventh avenue sa
loon, in New York.
According to the convict's story, a
mysterious rich man ntred him and an
other man to go to New Itochelle and
"do the job."
Dorothy Arnold has been missing for
six years, and her disappearance created
a widespread sensation. On several oc
casions she was reported found, and
there have been numerous versions of
her fate.
"If I dared," said Glenoris, "I could
name the rich man that hired me. My
life will be worth little when that gang
that hangs around the saloon knows I
told."
Rich Man Had Her Killed.
New York, April 17. Although skep
tical, the polico today were investigat
ing the story told by Edward Glenoris,
convict at Providence, It. I., who suid
thnt a rich New Y'ork man with his
own hands buried Dorothy Arnold, miss
ing heiress, after her death due to an
operation.
Reports from Providence suid that
Olenoris told the warden this story bo
causo of a troubled conscience. Ho re
cently "got religion." But when news
paper reporters visited Glenoris and
questioned him he appeared confused
and would not admit that he had con
fessed to having anything to do with
the Arnold case. . '-rtiW(l
Francis Arnold, father or the missing
Dorothy Arnold, does not believe the
story told by L'dward Glenoris, states
prison inmate, who says he stood guard
while a pal buried the body of tho van
ished heiress in a cellar,
"So far as it appears on the face of
the man's story," said Arnold, "ho is
talking litter nonsense."

A writ of mnadamtis requiring Secre
tary of State Olcott to show causa why
the name of Justice Charles K. Hughes
should not be certified to go on the
ballot as a candidate for the republican
nomination for president was issued to

Tho suit wns filed by Wallace Mc
Cammnnt, of Portland, who recites that
on April It, he filed an authenticated
petition signed by l.'l."il registered re
publican electors of the state of Ore
gon praying that the name of Hughes

tomorrow morning.
Tho writ demands that Olcott make
n return and answer the writ iu one day
after being served with the notice of
the writ but the Secretary of State
will wait until the letter is received
from Hughes before making answer
and until the letter is received from
Hughes before milking answer and will
Incorporate Hughes' answer in his re
turn. Late this afternoon Secretary of
State Olcott r ived the anticipated
letter from Justice Hughes in which
Hughes said in part: "I hereby do
cliae to have my name placed on tho

or hereafter circulated.'1 This states
Hughes stand in the matter in a few
words and in a formal notification
which was signed in person by Hughes

A letter from Lawrence H. Ghcen,
Hughes secretary, accompanied tho
formal objections sent by Hughes.
Hughes stated no reasons for declining
the nomination or for objecting that
his name be placed on the bullot ex
cept "just because" which, however,
has lmig been a sufficient reason in
many quarters.
SUBMARINE NOTE
TO MAKE DECfSIQ
Says Continuance of FricnSy
Relations Depends on Ger
many Now 1
UNOFFICIAL REPORTS
POUR IN RROM BERLIN
These Indicate Germany Will
Go To Great Length To
Avoid Break
By Eohert J. Bonder.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, April 17. The new sub
marine note to Germany will probably
go forward to Berlin tonight. The cab
inet has already ratified its substance,
so there is no necessity for holding it ui
until tomorrow's session of tho presi
dent's advisors.
At tho White House it was stated to
day that President Wilson had devoted
practically all his attention to tho docu
ment on Saturday and Sunday ami that
ne expected to put the last touches on i
this afternoon It is -still likely that
whon the message is completed, the
president will go over It with member
of tho 1101180 and senate foreign com
mittees, but he has not yet requested a
conference with them.
Tho final draft of the communication
to tho kaiser is believed to b about
complete. No engagement has been
scheduled with congressional leaders
yot, but the president's calendar is clear
tor a conference thia afternoon.
Unofficial reports ro pouring In
from Berlin, saying that Germany ni'l
go to the limit to avoid a diplomatic
break. Important cables from Ambas
sador Gerard were received dining the
day,, outlining Berlin's feeling concern
ing pending ncgotinnons.
The American note Is described as n
notice that continuunro of friendly re
lations with Germany depends on uc
tiou rather than words. It suggests that
promises of reparation for victims and
punishment for tho offending submarine
commander in the Sussex eme will not
suffice and that America's position is
based on a complete review of the sub
marine warfare ever since the Lusituuia
was sunk.
Officialdom believes that Germany
must change its mode of submarining
entirely if it wants relations to con
tinue. Unofficial reports from Berliu
that the kaiser's "government was
willing to meet America's position in
tho Sussex mutter brought official ex
pressions that that would not be enough
and that a more comprehensive settle
ment is wanted.
