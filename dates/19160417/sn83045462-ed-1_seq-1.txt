U-BOAT ULTIMATUM
READY TO BE SENT
WITHIN FEW HOURS
President Has It in Complete
Form: Presses Destruction
of Ships to Decision.
WILL SHOW GERMANY'S
PROMISES UNFULFILLED
Sussex Case Forms Only a Link in
Chain of Evidence Relating to
All Neutral Vessels.
DOCUMENT POSITIVE IN TONE
Dispatches Indicating Berlin Ready
to Meet This Country More Than
Half Way Will Not Change
Course Decided Upon. _
President "Wilson late today
completed the communication on
submarine warfare, which will i>e
sent tonight or tomorrow to Germany.
He immediately sent word
to Senator Stone, chairman of the
Senate foreign relations committee.
to confer on the situation.
The conference probably will be
held tonight. This action was
in line with the President's
policy of keeping Congress informed
of the progress of the
negotiaions.
President Wilson, it was said,
has been steadily engaged on the
note for two days. He did not
go to church yesterday, but
worked practically all day examining
evidence submitted iw
the State Department.
Scope of Document Stated..
The document, officials said, will press
the submarine issue to a decision. It was
reiterated that the Sussex case would
form only a link in the chain of evidence
the United States will present to Germany
to show that her promises have
not been fulfiled.
The document was characterized by
officials today as being very positive in
tone, and they believe that only a
prompt acquiescence by Germany in the
position taken by the United States can
prevent a break in diplomatic relations.
Unofficial dispatches from Berlin indicating
that the German government is
ready to meet the United States more
than half way, it was said, will not
change the course of the American government
decided on at Friday's cabinet
meeting.
Finishing Phraseology.
Before the communcation to Germany
goes forward the President aiul Secretarv
l^ansing may confer again, but it
was said early today that this was not
absolutely necessary. The President
and his cabinet have agreed on thesteps
to be taken and the President is
now finishing the phraseology of the
proposed communication. He intends
to include in the indictment of Germany's
submarine campaign attacks on
neutral vessels not carrying Americans.
That will be done on the broad grounds
of humanity and for the reason that
many of these neutral vessels were going
to or from the United States.
The State Department today received
a cable from Ambassador Gerard at
Berlin, which, it was said authoritatively.
was devoted entirely to editorial
expressions from the German newspapers.
Report Not Yet Submitted.
State Department officials declared
the ambassador had not yet submitted
a report of conversations he was reported
in press dispatches last week
to have had with officials of the foreign
office.
Additional instructions from the German
government to Count von Bernetorff.
the German ambassador, were
awa.ted at the German embassy early
today. Unofficial advices said that such
Instructions had been sent from Berlin.
It is regarded as not unlikely that
the German ambassador may call at
the State Department to ascertain, if
possible, the views of the Washington
government and possibly express the j
views of his government.

American Society.
Inspiring addresses by the President
of the United States and by the president
general of the National Society
Daughters of the American Revolution,
caused the more than 3,000 delegates to
spontaneously engage in a patriotic
demonstration at the opening exercises
of the twenty-fifth Continental Congress
in Memorial Continental Hall today.
Preparedness for the nation against
foreign aggression was the keynote of
these addresses and the audience cheered
enthusiasticaly every reference to
defense of national honor and a zeal to
keep the glory of the flag unsullied.
Mrs. William Cumming Story, president
general, in her greeting to the
congress pleaded that they should subordinate
any other purposes or differences
to a general zeal for preparedness,
not for aggression but for protection
against attack by foreign foe.
She also gave .an encouraging report
of ttfe fiitaj??ig.l progress made during
her administration. She said that while
the debt on the memorial building
when she assumed office was $125,000,
it is now but $45,000, and that she expects
it will be reduced $20,000 more
during the congress. She announced
that the property in the rear of the
memorial building is now owned by
the D. A. R., and that she has money
in hand to make first payment on adjacent
lots.
Illness or Mrs. McLean Announced.
A note of sadness was sounded at the
morning session when Mrs. Story announced
that Mrs. Donald McLean, a
former president general, is dangerously
ill at the home of her brotherin-law,
Admiral McLean, at the I'nited
States navy yard. Norfolk. Mrs. Bryan
of Tennessee, a veteran of the society,
on the invitation of the president general,
spoke in eulogy of Mrs. McLean's
service to the society and expressed
the sympathy of the twenty-fifth congress.
Trouble over the recognition by the
society tf{ Mrs. Mary S. Lock wood, the
chaplain general, as a founder, which,
report among the delegates says, is to
break out in the congress, was somewhat
quieted at the very opening of the
morninsr session when Mrs. Story in
her first sentence referred to Mrs.
Lockwood as "our justly well beloved
chaplain general." This was taken by
many of the delegates as a public notification
that Mrs. Story wil not take
any part in a controversy hostile to
Mrs. Lock wood.
The report by Miss Hilda Fletcher,
chairman of the credentials committee,
showed that there are 1,507 chapters,
five of which are not entitled to vote.
93 are not represented, IM have not reported
and that 2,255 are entitled to
vote.
First Political Clash.
The first clash of politics came early,
when Mrs. Robert G. Hogan, formerly
state regent of Maryland, moved that
in the balloting thepe should be a teller
to represent each of the contesting
parties. Those who were on the "inside"
said this action was taken because
Mrs. William H. Talbott of Rockville,
vice regent for Maryland, is a
candidate for vice president general,
and that Mrs. Arthur Lee Bosley, the
state regent, refused to recognize her
candidacy.
The calling of the roll occupied most
of the morning, the state regent or
alternate making the response. California
was cheered when the record
showed a large delegation, and Connecticut
also was applauded for a large
delegation. Mrs. Frank F. Greenawalt,
state regent for the District of Columbia.
reported sixty-six delegates registered
out of a possible sixty-seven.
Massachusetts' entire delegation arose
in response to the roll call, and there
was prolonged cheering for the group
of eighty-five delegates and manyalternates.
In Place of Honor.
Seated on the platform were Mr6.
Lock wood, who read Scripture and.
prayers; Mrs, John F. Swift, vice president
general, of California; Mrs. Samuel
Spencer, chairman of the reception
committee, who is Mrs. Story's chief

German Statement Says French Suffered

Fort Douaumont.
AIRMEN KEEP UP ACTIVITY
French Squadron Takes Advantage
of Intense Fog to Carry Out
Extensive Bombing
Operations.
PARIS. April 17.?After temporarily
assuming the aggressive
in the Verdun battle, launching
attacks in the Douattmont-Yaux
region which are declared to hate
gained them some ground, the
l rench yesterday and last nig! 1
held their infantry in check.
Neither was there any move by
the (ierman infantry arm. according
to this afternoon's official
statement.
Apparently a new movement of
some importance is preparing
west of the Mettse. Heavy bombardment
of the French positions
in the Avocourt region and along
the line for some distance northeast,
including the Dead Man's
I {ill sector, has been mentioned in
several recent official statements
by the French war office and similar
artillery activity is again recorded
today.
French Official Report.
The official statement Issued today says:
"On the left bank of the River Meuse
there has been an Intense bombardment
of the French positions in the Avocourt
wood and on the front from Le Mort
Homme (Dead Man's hill) to Cumieres
"On the right bank of the river the
night passed in relative calm, except in
the region to the south of Hadromont
Wood, where there was continued artilwood,
where there was continued artilattacks
during the day and night.
"There is nothing to report from the
remainder of the front, with the exception
of the customary cannonading.
"During the night of April 16-17 a
French air squadron, composed of nine
machines, during an intense fog executed
certain important bombing operations
in the region of Confians. Pagny,
Arnaville and Romdach. Projectiles were
dropped as follows: Twelve shells on the
railroad station at ("onflans, sixteen on
the factory at Rombach, eight on the
railroad station at Arnaville, eleven on
the railroad line at Pagny and Ars.
"During the night of April 15-16 a
French armed aeroplane, flying over the
Xorth sea at an altitude of 300 feet
threw sixteen shells at a vessel of the
enemy. Eleven of these missiles found
their mark."
Capture of Trenches Claimed.
A French infantry attack in the Verdun
region south of Douaumont Saturday
resulted in the capture of portions
of some German trenches, the war
office announced yesterday. Two hundred
Germans were taken prisoners.
"The bombardment continued last
night on ih* left bank of the Meuse,
in the sector between Avocourt and
Caurettes wood, the statement says.
"On the right bank we delivered a
spirited attack toward the end of yesterday
against German positions south
of Douaumont. This effort, which was
completely successful, made it possible
for us to occupy certain elements of
the enemy's trenches and capture 200
men, of whom two were officers
"In the Woevre our first line positions
were bombarded intermittently.
There was no important event on the
remainder of the front except the
usual cannonading."
French Repulsed, Says Berlin.
BERLIN, April 17, via London.?After
extensive bombardment large
French forces on the Verdun front attacked
German positions near Fort
Douaaumont Saturday. The German
war office says the French were repulsed
with heavy losses.
Today the war office gave out the
following statement:
"There are no incidents to report
from the western front. In the region
of Pervyse, Flanders, an enemy aeroplane
was brought down by our antiaircraft
guns close behind the Belgian
lines, and was destroyed by our artillery.
First Lieut. Barthold brought
down northwest of Peronne his fifth
enemy areoplane. a British biplane.
The pilot was dead and the observer
seriously injured."
Fighting on British Front.
LONDON, April 17. ?The British official
statement on the campaign in
France and Belgium issued last night
reads:
"l^ist night, after the explosion of
two mines, our troops carried out a
small raid against the enemy trenches
south of the Bethune-Labassee road
with satisfactory results.

DISICT MAY LOSE
By NOUS SPEEDING
Practically All Chances for
Laws Relating to Local Interests
Appear Destroyed.
The rules committee of live House
meets this afternoon for the purpose
of changing the gearing of the legislative
machinery to a higher speed, and
an siRns poini 10 a program wnicn
will abolish practically all chances of
legislation from the District committee.
A place for the District appropriation
bill will be found on the program,
and Chairman Page of the subcommittee
having that bill in charge will
plan to bring in a special rule so as to
make privileged tbe litems of legislation
which will appear on the bill. This
will be done so as to avoid the delays
incident to points of order, etc.
The District bill is completed, but is!
I in hiding. Representative Page does
not want the bill to hang on the calendar
any length of time after being
reporter! to the House, for the reason,
presumably, that there are things committed
and omitted in connection with
the bill which may cause a procession
of District residents to the Capitol
daily if the measure is allowed to remain
on the calendar long after being
reported. It is planned, therefore, to
report the bill at the right moment,
and then take it tip for consideration
in the House as soon as possible thereafter.
Program Undecided.
Just where the District bill will be
placed in the forthcoming program has
not been definitely determined ? at
least, not up to- a late hour today.
There was a determination last week
to allow the diplomatic and consular
appropriation bill to follow the agricultural
appropriation bill, now being
debated, and after tbe diplomatic bHi
to take up the District bill. This may
be changed somewhat in the speedingup
process.
One of the features of the proposal of
the leaders who will meet this afternoon
in the rules committee is the plan
to abolish unanimous consent days,
which are the Mondays intervening between
District days. To clean up the
bills which would ordinarily he taken
up on unanimous consent days a series
of night sessions is planned. Claims
and other private measures will also
be considered at night if the plans are
adopted.
District committee business will be
eiven a setback bv the nmnrmui tr. r*r?n
vene the House dally at 11 o'clock.!
The rule of the committee is to adjourn j
promptly at ten minutes of the time the j
House meets. The committee is called
together generally at 10:30 o'clock,
which allows only twenty minutes for
committee business. As the committee
has been operating considerably on a
twenty-minute basis recently, it has
been shown that no business can be
accomplished In that short space of
time.
Want to Finish by July.
The leaders want to finish the House
business by July. They have practically
the entire program the session to
complete, therefore, in* the last two
weeks of April, the month of May and
part of the month of Jane. The conventions
of the two parties will take
practically three weeks out of June, so
therefore the House has a wonderfully
heavy job on its hands. The administration
program, including the tariff
commission and the Philippine bill, has
to be finished. This, of course, is Independent
of the entirely necessary and
utterly neglected program of revenue raising.
All the big appropriation bills have to
be passed with the exception of the
legislative, post office and Indian. The
enormous naval bill, which has yet to
be reported; the fortifications bill, the
biggest ever seen, and the new in- ,
creased army appropriation bill, calling
for millions upon millions of money
yet unprovided for, complicate the
speed problem. And after these bills :
are passed the House must pass a
measure to provide for about $200,000,000
of additional revenue. i

ATTORNEYAMBROSE
District Court pf Appeals Re- '
verses His Conviction
and Sentence.
William K. Ambrose, member of the
bar, convicted of embezzling funds i
coming into his hands as guardian of 1
two minor children and sentenced to
serve ten years in the penitentiary, was
granted a new trial today by the District
Court of Appeals. The opinion of
the appellate tribunal was rendered by
Justice Robl> and concurred in by Justice
Van Orsdel. chief Justice Shepard
concurred in the judgment only.
Krrors of the trial court in admitting
testimony relating to alleged actions
by Ambrose in other cases in which he
sustained a fiduciary relation long
prior to the alleged embezzlement and
refusing evidence as to the settlement
of these claims when demand was made f
as shown by an account approved by
the I'rohate Court, are the chief reasons
assigned for reversing the conviction
and sentence. 1
Intent Must Be More Clearly Proved 1
The court holds that evil intent, so ^
necessary to any conviction of embezzlement.
must be more clearly proved
in a case involving executors and ^
other fiduciaries under section 841 of the
code, "for the duties and powers ot
an executor or guardian are broader 1 c
control of funds coining- into his I
hands th^n arc generally exercised by
an agent, attorney or clerk.
"A guardian has complete charge of the
property of his ward that comes into his
possession and must keep it properly and
safely invested. While, of course, it is '
the better way for the guardian to keep f
money of his ward entirely separate from j.
his own. the mere fact that he does not .
do so affords no sufficient basis for a
presumption of evil intent."
The court suggests that the fiduciary c
and his bondsmen are liable in the event ^
of loss. .

MEXICAN AMBASSADOR
AWAITING VERIFICATION
Remains Were Due to Arrive at
Chihuahua Last Night. But
Did Not Do So.
Although twenty-four hour?,
have passed since Mexican advices
told of the finding of the
body of Francisco Villa, the
W ashington government has received
as yet no information ?'ii
the subject from its representatives
in Mexico, civil or military.
Administration officials grow
more doubtful of the truth of the
report as time passes without
confirmation.
No Information at Embassy.
The body said to be that of Villa was
supposed to have reached Chihuahua
city by special train some time last
IlIKIll. .Alllt'l ICdll < liCU uri rl I
that place has not been heard from. It
was pointed out that his report might
have been delayed. Officials noted, however.
thai the consul had not even forwarded
rumors as to Villa's death
which must be circulating in Ohihuahua.
The Mexican embassy also was with>
out additional information on the subject
today. The last report from Consul
Garcia said he was seeking confirmation
of the reports transmitted by
railway telegraph operators in the
region where the body is said to have
been found., Apparently he had not been
successful, and the embassy's advices
5 still were viewed as doubtful.
Secretary Baker today received a dis'
patch from Xaco saying that Gen. Villa
- was last heen heading in the direction
ef the place where reports yesterday
said he was buried. The dispatcn was ;
; taken by War Department officials to '
1 mean that the reports of Villa's death
might be true. The dispatch was immediately
sent to President Wilson.
i Department Officials Silent.
; State and War Department officials refused
to comment today on Gen. Per*
shing's report of the Parral incident,
' which is in contradiction of the version
' transmitted by Gen. Oarranza to mtp>
port his suggestion that American tfoopfi
, be withdrawn from Mexico. The report J
, shows that Oarranza troops not only
joined in the attack upon the little de- |
tachment of Americans, but followed
i them several miles as they withdrew in .
( an effort to avoid a clash with the de
facto government forces.
5 Gen. Carranza*8 message said his forces
. had sought to suppress firing at the
. Americans by Mexician civilians. The
majority of the Mexican killed are now
reported by Gen. Pershing to have been
i Oarranza soldiers, one of whom was an
, officer.
It was indicated at the State Depart'
ment that further details would be
sought from the American officers be
fore a reply would be sent to Gen. |
I Oarranza. Secretary Lansing planned1
| originally to deal with the Parral in-!
cldent as a separate matter, not in tnej
reply to the note suggesting the recall!
of the American expedition on <iiplo- f
matic grounds.
Reply Is Being Prepared. 1
The reply to the diplomatic note was '
stiil in preparation early today. It will ,
outline the terms under whicti the
United States will discuss withdrawal
of its forces with the de facto government,
and unless reports of Villa's
death are confirmed no change in the
program will be made at this time.
It was reasserted today tnat should

the expedition would come out of Mex- (
ico at once. No instructions have yet
been sent to t'onsul Ueteher or Gen.
Pershing, however, as to the identification

until these officials trayrfcmit some
report.

FROM MEXICO YET
Body Fails to Arrive at Cusihuiriachic
Today, as
Expected.
CONSUL IS CONFIDENT
IN SPITE OF THE DELAY
Difficulty Will Be Had in Making
Identification Even if Bandit's
Remains Are Found.
EL PASO, Tex.. April 17.?
Confirmation of Mexican reports
that Francisco Villa's borlv lia'l
been exhumed at San Franc'sco
Korja and was being brought to
Chihuahua Citv was still lacking
at the headquarters of the de facto
government at Juarez today.
Gabriel (javira. commander of
the Juarez garrison, awaited information
from official sources
that, would dispel any question of
doubt over the reports of the findings
of the bandit's body, but the
Mexican telegraph lines were
silent on the subject.
Consul Garcia Is Confident.
"f still feel reasonably certain that
the messages received Sunday that Villa'*
body had been found are correct,'' said
Andres Garcia. Mexican consul here today.
"I shall make every effort to have
the body brought to Juarez, where Americans
who knew, him may make an identification
that will be satisfactory to the
American people."
A dispatch wad received by Gen. Gavira,
commander of the Juare? garrison,
from CusihuiriaeWc at 1? :30 o'clock this
morning stating that the body of Francisco
Villa had not arrived there at that
hour.
De facto government officials were nor
able to give any information regarding an
unofficial dispatch from Mexico City stating
that Minister of War Obregon ha I
announced that Villa's body was buried
at San Francisco Horja and was not
en route to Chihuahua City. It was believed
here that there was some error
in the cable and telegraphic transmission
of the Mexico City dispatch. Consul Garcia
s information was that the body of
Villa had been exhumed at San Francisco
Borja and was being brought into <'usihuiriachic,
where it was to be sent on a
special train to Chihuahua City.
Official word from Washington that the
I'nited States troops would I** immediately
withdrawn from Mexico if Villa was
dead will undoubtedly result in expediting
the efforts of the de facto government
to ascertain the truth of the reports of
the locating of Villa's body.
Expect Delay in Identification.
If the supposed body of the handit is
still interred at San Francisco Borja, as
stated in the latest Mexico City advices, it
will likeiy be many days before an identification
can be made unless the Mexican
government accepts as final the identification
made by Carranza officers now
in the vicinity of San Francisco Borja,
which is thirty miles by trail south of
Cusi h u i riaeh i c.
Identification of tha body at this tun^
may prove baffling. According to ihreports
from Mexico City. Vilia has
been dead over two weeks, and physical
changes may be such as to preclude
as positive proof that the dead
man was Villa. Mexican officials hersaid
that the I'nited States government
undoubtedly would accept the identification
if made by responsible Mexicans
who knew Villa, and by Mexican
officials.
A number of newspaper correspondents
and a few other Americans left
here early today for Chihuahua in the
hope that the story of the finding of
Villa's body was true Several other
Americans, who at first had intended
to go, abandoned the trip, some through
skepticism and others because of rioting
that was reported here to have occurred
the Mexican state capital
during the last two days.
Origin of Latest Villa Story.
That Francisco Villa is dead and his
body, disinterred some days after his
burial, is in possession of the Carranza
troops, was the tenor of a. series of
telegraphic messages received in Juarez
yesterday by the Mexican officials. For
more than a week reports that Villa
bad died from wounds have been rur*ent
both here and in Juarez. Yeeterlay's
accounts were the most circumstantial
and apparently reliable yet
received. They were accepted with reerve
by American officials, including Brig.
Sen. George Bell, but the Mexican oficials
expressed confidence in their reiability.
The messages, in the order
n which they were received, were as
'ollows:
"The dispatcher of the Mexican
Northwestern railroad at Juarez re>orted
to Gen. Gavira, Carranza comnander
at Juarez, that he had heard
i conversation on. the telegraph wire
o the effect that Villa's body was in
he hands of the Carranza troops.
"Gen. Gavira notified Consul Andres
rarcia here, who rushed messages to
he telegraph operators at Madera and
'usihulriachic asking for confirmation.
"The Madera and Cusihuiriachic opertora
answered confirming the report
nd stating the body was being taken
o Chihuahua.
"The telegraph operator at San Anonio.
fifty miles west of Chihuahua,
elegrtfphed Consul Garcia thnt Villa's
ody was in possession of Col. Carlos
arranza. nephew of Gen. Carranza.
.'ho was taking it in a special train
o Chlhuihua."
