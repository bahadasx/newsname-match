Ei ARNOLD CASE
Convict's Story Likely to Clear
Up Mystery of Heiress'
Disappearance.
Internntlonal News Service:
PKOVIDKNCi:. 11. 1.. April 17.
j The mystery of the disappearance of
Horothy Arnold, the .New orn
heiress, may be solved in investiga
tions started by the police today fol
lowing the confessions of an inmate
of a Rhode Island penal institution.
While the police were searching for
the girl's body, the nanus of the
convict and bis accomplices were
withheld. His knowledge of the
mystery, however, commences oni
after the death of the girl. He de-
elures he dr.es not know what the
"Job" was. He says he was paid $250
for his part in disposing cf the dead
man. He said:
"The job wa. framed in a Seventh
av. saloon in New York. A rich man
took another fellow and myself to
New Kochelle late one night. Wo
were told to protect the gentleman
in case of trouble. I did not know
what the Job was about, but was
paid $.-.' for my 'part.
"We leached a house ju-t otltfide
of New Kochelle and a m? n brought
a woman out in his arms. We wer
driven through New York to West
Point, where the unconscious wom
an was carried into the house and
placed on a couch.
'The next night the limousine call-

and she was buried.

"The girl was iK.rothy Arnold. I
had nothing to do with the job hut
he prepared to protect the gentle
man in ca.-e of tro.ihle.
"I sat along-ide the woman during
the reic in the limo;:ine and can
describe her in every detail. If I
dared I could name the man who
was hired with me. Mv life would
he worth little when the gang which
hangs around the Seventh av. saloon
knows I told my part it; the job."

ontession in order 'o ease his con
science. The prisoner, who has sTved si
months of a two ears' .-entence, de-j-cribed

ALLIES' DEMANDS
STIR DP GREECE
New Crisis Precipitated by
Proposal to Use Railways
For Entente Troops. .
Internntin;il News Service:
!A'l)OX, April 17. Pollowing
the adjournment of the (ireek cham
ber of deputies the (Jreek cabinet
f.nd the general staff today assumed
.'.bsolute control of the government,
says a dispatch from Athens.
The most important question
which demands a solution now is the
demand of the allies !or use of the
railway lines for the transportation
of Serbian troops from the Adriatic
to the Aegean coast.
A strong protest lias been lodged
by the German allies against Greece,
giving the Anglo-French forces con
trol of the railway lines.
Greece is more completely under
the domination of the entente pow
ers than at any other time since
operations became active in thc
Palkans. The indications are that
allied troops will be landed on
Crete as Pritish and French war
ships are now anchored off the
island.
There was a conference between
Premier Sknulotulis and members of
his cabinet last night at which a
message was rend from King Con
sfantine. This messaie, it was indi
cated by Athens advices, contained
the king's views upon the allies' de
mands for Use of the trans-Greek
rnilw a s.
Public feeling has become very
high as a result of the new crisis
which faces the country. Threaten
ed by both alliances Greece is in a
perilous position. Much resentment
is being expressed in othcial circles
in the Greek capital over the latent
demands of the allied governments.
Cordiality Growing.
Advices from Home announcing
growing cordiality in the relations
between Italy and Greece wer re
ceived here with high satisfaction.
Haron Sonnino. the Italian foreign
minister, speaking In the chamber
of deputies, announced that Italy is
not considering any policy of con
quest in the Palkan at this time.
The occupation of Kpirtis by Ital
ian troops, P.aron Sonnino said, was
merely temporary and was made
necessary by military exigencies.
However, the Italian foreign min
ister refused, to speak on Italy's for
eign policy to any great extent say
ing that the enemy might profit by
it if lie did so.
Speaking of the part Italy had
plaved in helping sae the Serbian
army, the Vrb refugees and the
Austro-I I ungarian prisoners in the
h "ids of the Serbs. Uamn Sonnino
said:
"The Italian navy transported
2r.ö.ioiii persons. In addition to the
transports it was necessary for us
to furnish . onvovs of warships."
The foreign ndtrster said that the
relations between Italy and Russia
were mu h improved and announced
that Italy woahi be represented on
the permanent committee whh h the
allies are establishing in Paris to
prevent supplies of any kind from
reaching Germany from any source
whatever outside of the territory held
bv the Teutonic allies.

dominant figure in the Parral battle.
Wounded by one of the first volleys
fired by the Mexicans he stayed at
the head of his men and directed the
operations that saved the force from

Tompkins effect his retreat in a bril

In the meantime American armv

ofbeial Mexican reports of Villa's
death. If these are part of a plan
to get the Americans .Kit of Mexico,
however, the Fnited States military
leaders will have "to be shown."
