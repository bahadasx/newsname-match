ports. civilians fired on United States
soldiers and in an exchange of shots
several were killed on both sides.
J'arral is about 150 miles south of
1CI Paso and is the most southern point

;Eycs of Good Roads Enthu
siasts Now Turned to
Lincoln District.
Tho date of tlio road bond election
in Grunt district lias been fixed by
the county court for May 23. May 20
I was the first possible date that could
have been used, as the law requires
30 days' notice after the publication
of the petition. But because of May
20 being on Saturday, it was thought
more advisable to fix the date for the
following Tuesday, which is May 2.1.
The result of the special election
| in Lincoln district is being eagerly
I awaited liy tho good roads workers
| all over the county. This election is
j to bo held on Wednesday of next week
j which is April 2t>. The concensus of
I opinion throughout the district seems
to bo that the bonds will carry by a
large majority. The fact, that both
Fairmont and Mannington districts,
which are on each side of Lincoln,
have practically all of theiV roads im
proved, has by contrast influenced tho
voters of Lincoln district to a consid
erable degree.
The leading citizens throughout the
entire district are thoroughly convin
ced of the benefit to be derived by
the whole community by permanent
improved roads and the majority be
lieve that the bond plan is the most
practical of any method of building
them.
The name of 17. S. Downs, publish
ed as the eighth name on the list of
signers of the Lincoln district road
bond election petition, is an error, and
should read ,T. S. Downs.

Fire Department Monkey
Was a Reqular Capitalist
Erad Seventy Pennies And
Variety of Other Treas
ures in Two Banks.
If the ghost of Dickjtthe pet, monkey
of the lire department, who died Inst
week, hovers about the engine house ,
said spirit of the deceased must have j
been considerably moved by events i
which transpired this morning.
This being clean-up day, the firemen ,
cleaned out the former abode of the
monkey, incidentally broke open two;
banks of which Dick was the officers, i
directors and depositors. They aiso I
found the last will and testament of J
J the deceased, evidently written during;
the last hours when the sun of his
I life had set and the dark shadows of
[death were fast enfolding him.
Dick had two banks. One an iron
pipe which ran across his cage, the
other an old feed box. tised before the
auto took the place of the horse. The
firemen found a curious lot of deposits
in the bank, including seventy pen
nies. peanuts, used and unused: mar
bles, ball-bearings, toothpicks, match
es, shoe-hooks, waahers. key rings,
chewing gum, Fatima coupons and
other things dear to the childish heart
of the monk: and last but not least,
tucked away in the feed box vault.

Hold-TJp Man Is
Again at His Tricks!
BELIEVED THAT PARTIALLY DE
MENTED MAN IS RESPONSI
BLE FOR THE ACTIONS.
: Several times lately inconvenience
| and embarrassment has been exper
ienced by couples and by lone women
about the city after dark on account
I of a probably partially demented
I prowler approaching them on the
I streets and ordering them home or
threatening them with arrest.
, The nuisance, if such he can be call
ed, is in citizens' clothes and upon
each occasion opons his coat and flash
es a badge upon his victims. The mat
ter has been reported to the police,
but they arc unable to trace the per:
petrator as the camplalntants always
report that ho held them up on lonely
streets or in quiet residence sections
of tho city.
Last night the badge wearer Jiad a
companion and ventured to the South
Side and down Fifth street, whore
they startled a couple on their way
home. They ordered the young man
and young woman to "hold up your
hands, you're under arrest".
Tho woman, frightened, ran and es
caped in the darkness. The young man
who, of course felt safe in standing to
reason with a policeman In caao he
was to he questioned, made no move,
and while thus standing unarmed/was
held by ono of the men while tho
other chased the girl. She luckily
evaded her pursuer and later reported
the occurrence to the police.
War Drives Up
Price of Bibles
and Hymnals
NEW YORK. April 17.?The
prion of Bibles has increased and
is likely to advance a till1 further

ties show that the expense" of pub
lishing prayer books, hymnals and
other religious volumes is so much
larger than heretofore, that buyers
have been obliged to'pay nearly
double last year's prices. This is
due plainly to the advanco in the
cost of paper, ink. leather and glue.

Successor As West Virginia
Manager Is C. H.
Tarleton.
F. R. Lyon, general manager of
operations of the Consolidation Coal
company, announced this morning the
appointment of Calvin H. Tarleton as
manager of the West Virginia division
of the corporation to succeed Harry
Ii. Watson, who has resigned to de?
vote his time to the development of
some coal property of his own. The
official announcement o? the pending
change, which will go into effect May
1. include^. a note to the .effect, that
Mr. 'Watson hail intended to retire
from the service of the Consolidation
at "the first of' the year, but that he
agreed to remain a few months longer
at the request of the general operating
officers of tho company.
The new head of the West Virginia
mines began life at? a mule driver
L'S years ago. Ho did not remain in
that humble position, however, for in
a short time he was a full fledged min
or. His next step was to the respon
sibilities of firo boss at the Gaston
mine near Fairmont. From that he ad
vanced to the assistant mine foreman
ship and finally the foreraanship.
In 1903 he was appointed the gen
eral mine foreman to New England
cind Gaston mines serving in that ca
pacity with George T. Watson who
was superintendent of those . mines
from 1901 to 1906. In 1906 Mr. Tarleton
was advanced to the position of di
vision mine inspector and a short time
later was made chief mine inspector
of all mines in the West Virginia di
vision and in 1909 was promoted to
superintendent of mining for tho
same territoryt which position, he has
held until tho* present appointment.
His many experiences from the be
ginning of his coal mining career un
til tho present ha:ve admirably fitted
him with a direct intimate knowledge
of all tho mines in this valley. Mr.
Tarleton has for years been consid-,
ercd an expert on mine ventilation
and sanitary conditions, and has de
voted a great (leal of his time and
direction towards improving safety
conditions and arrangements. He is
not only personally acquainted with
the. management of each mine, but
with the employees as well, and is
held in the highest esteem by them.
