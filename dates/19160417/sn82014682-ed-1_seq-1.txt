Strong indications of a conspiracy,
aid for the defense on the part of She
riff Rose and a long-draw ri out, de
tailed cross-examination of the two;
witnesses for the prosecution marked
the opening of the hearing Saturday
by the Civil Service Commission on
the bribery charge against Jesse Gray;

the charges are disposed of. it was
announced Saturday. The proseeu
tion has one more witness to Intro
dtrce. declared A-.M. Cristy, first dep
uty city attorney. , After that Gray's
attorney, J. B. Lightfoot, will take up
the defense. "
The charges, of conspiracy , were
made at the beginning of the hearing,
as" the result or a request by the de
fense that Chang Chau. a Chinese
spectator, be -barred from the court
rodm. When reasons were requested
slot), the attorney for the defense re
fused to state them publicly, beyond
declaring that Chang Chau was to-be
called as a witness for the defense.
Questioned. Chang Chau declared that
he was not aware of Mr. IJgbtfoot's
intention. Then an executive confer
ence of the commissioners, the attor
neys for the prosecution and for the
defense was requested.
Ahlna Telia of Chef a Games.
Ahlna was the first man on the
stand. He broke out In excited Eng
liah occasionally,' but jfor the most
part bis testimony was made intelli
gible through an interpreter. He told
of . conducting a chefa game labels
room., at VVahiawa from January 23
to tell of everything he had done or
seen In that period, but proved some
what recalcitrant when called on to
Ull anything of his previous life. He
has been In Hawaii for about 10 years,
he testified, and has made his living
by chefa practically all of this time.
He told of running a game when he
first came hero and said he had open
ed and closed so many since that he
could not tell anything about them
they were one confused mass in his
memory. At times he. apparently
rrould not testify readily. He remem
bered a conversation with Gray that
took place shortly after he opened his
last game, but could not tell the
tines, of any of the "runners" work
ing for him the latter part of March.
There were 13 or 1C of them he de
clared, when pressed, and all of those
arrested at tho time of Gray's raid on
his case (the afternoon the charges
csir.st the officer were filed) were
in his employ.' " He ' tinalfy remember
ed tLe came cf one of them, but that
wa3 all he could recall. He was ad
monished several times by the chair
man of the commission, and it:was
pointed out "that he was discrediting
hl3 own testimony by his refractory
tact!es. . .",' .
UoIIed down , to essential facts his
UEuacny was mai: -
Ho opened a chefa game at Wa
hlawa. on January 23.
Oa January 23 he met Gray, told
hln he -was operating a game and
passed him the first $5.
, Every week thereafter he met Gray
cn the street; by chance, not by ap
po!stir.ent, and in thaking handswitu
kin passed a gold piece. I .
After March 20, the day he made
his affidavit accusing Gray, the police
officer refused to take his money. '"
uveryone knew mat tiray WA3
fixed." He told all of his patrone,
fcr they were always Inquiring what
the chances of a raid were.
At the request cf the commission
he then repeated in English his con
versation with. Gray when negotia
tions were opened. He. said that ho
met hin near the ball park, stopped
hin and said: "Jm running a' little
game now. -1 give you $5 now. Byo
tzi bye, tier game, more money,'
Gray answered, according to Ahlna:
"All right I'll keep my mouth shut."

DR. SCHURMANN MAY
LEND AID TO GERMAN
HOSPITAL SERVICE
In response to an appeal made in a.
recent letter from his father In Ger
many, asking that he devote himself
with others to helping in the care of
wounded soldiers, Dr. F. H, Schur
inann of this city' may offer his ser
vices for hospital work in the Father
land. -
"I am certainly willing1, to go,! Dr.
Schumann told the' Star-Bulletin to
day, "and if things can be arranged
satisfactorily I may answer the call
for help." v,-- ' -' -'v'
In hit letter Cr. Schumann's fath
er, who is a retired professor of the
Imperial University of Berlin, declares
that the three' objective points of the
German attack are Riga, Verdun and
Calais, in the belief that their capture
will put the army near enough the
several capitals of the entente powers
to control the situation. He expresses
unbounded faith in the outcome of
the great conflict,
A previous letter, to which Profes
sor Schumann refer in this missive
as being unanswered, was published
in the Star-Bulletin several weeks ago.

Second Witness on. if v j -
ting Chon was the second and last
witness on the stand. He declared
that he was Ahin's partner in the
game at Wahlawa. He had passed
money but once to Gray, but' under
stood that Ahlna gave him $5 a week
for protection, he said. He corrobo
rated Ahina's testimony that they had
closed up once for two days on Gray'a
suggestion, as he told them a raid
was contemplated i j the Waialua
p6IIce. , . f l x
Gray met him one time in February
on the street, he said, and asked him
for a loan of $5. He unhesitatingly
han!sd it over, as he know thai Ahlna
was paying him $5 every week.

Bulletin Classified
Mrs. James Rath of the Baby Week
committee said today that some
mothers have been averse to entering
their babies ' in the examinations, as
they believed they and their babies
would be on exhibition before a crowd
of spectators. Their . enthusiastic
support' has been won by explaining
to them ..the nature of the examina
tions and the scoring, which Is entire
ly private In every case. The com
parisons as to relative standings of
babies - entered are made from the
score cards.
"The records of baby contests he!d
elsewhere show that few, if any;
reach a perfect score of 100 per cent,
and even among the healthy babies
only a relatively small number ar
over 90 per cent, she said.
The most encouraging thing about
all the entries sj far is that most of
the mothers are concerned not at all
in the prizes they may receive if
their babies get the greatest number
of points from the examining physi
cians, dentists and other specialists;
but are very desirous of having the
honor of being the parent of the best
baby in the contest," declared Mrs.
Rath. . . "
The executive committee is hard at
work collecting funds that have been
promised and solicit all their friend
to help towards completing the de
sired total of $400 as early as possible
so that the more serious work can be
proceeded with. ,
The committee is also desirous of
finding some well wisher who will
finance a prise contest. The Star
Bulletin has offered two sets of prizes,
one for the best essay by a mother
on the care of children or some phase
of the subject of child welfare, a
prize of $15, and '$5 for the second,
and a further prize of $10 for the first
baby born during Baby Week as evl-.
denced by a physician's certificate:
The prize that the committee wants
arranged is for the three babies of
whatever nationality scoring ; first,
second and third in the contest for
points as indicated in Saturady's Star
Bulletin. : ;
One of the most striking exhibits
that will be made at Palama Settle
ment next week will be that showing
