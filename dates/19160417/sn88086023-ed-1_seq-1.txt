HE HELPED BURY
Tears coursing down his cheeks ar.i

J. Martin. Fruitvale fanner who was
convicted last week of an attempted
criminal assault upon -a young girl
this afternoon pleaded for mercy be.
fore Circuit Judge Phelps. Because
ol the nature of the case, however,
the court refuse fat interfere with the
operation of the law. giving him the
sentence provided by statute, impris
onment in the penitential from one
to ten years.
Time for sentence was fixed for
this morning but W. M Peterson,
Martin's attorney, filed a motion for
arrest of Judgment. At 1:30 this af
ternoon Martin himself appeared be
fore the court. He blamed whisker
for his acts and pleaded for the sake
of his wife and five children that
mercy be extended to him. He talked
for about 15 minutes, his voice some,
times rising shrilly under his agita
tion. Frequently he paused and bur
ed h s brow in his hand.
His attorney stated that he felt
sure that, if the court would parole
him, he would go to Montana to live
with his sons and that he would
never conduct himself unlawfully.
Addressing the convicted man,
Judge Phelps told him that he came
with poor grace at this time to plead
for mercy. "I am glad you are show
ing sorrow and remorse.'' he said,
"and I am sorry you did not manifest
such feelings earlier 'n the trial. Tou
declare now that you were drunk but,
during the trial, you denied that you
had been drinking and tried to place
the blame upon the young girl whom
you tried to wrong."
Judge Phelps told him that he
could secure a petition for parole
from among his neighbors and present
lit to the governor hot his attorney re
! fused to undertake this until he found
out the sentiment among hs neighbors.

WASHINGTON, Aprtl 17. Officials
-trained every resource today to con
firm or disprove the reported death
( Villa. The reports thrilled every
body from Wilson down. If true. It
means that the Mexican situation no
longer exists
No, steps have been taken toward
lie withdrawal of troops. Lansing
and Baker said that the soldiers would
leave Mexico shortly If Villa's death
was verified. If the question la mere
ly one of Identification of the body,
it will be answered quickly.
EL PASO, April 17 Garcia stated
today that neither he nor Gavlra had
received confirmation of the report
that Villa's body had been recovered
and identified. It Is believed diffi
cult to establish Identity because of
the length of time It had been buried.
Garcia said he would be satisfied If
Colonel Carranza says the body Is
Villa's.
Funston wired officers at Douglas
to find Doctor Wlckman. whom Vil
la made a prisoner to secure treat
ment for a blood disease. Wlckman
will attempt to identify the body.
Funston is seeking others Intimate

troops under Major Howse was at

corpse was exhumed. Howse did not

A train left Juarez this morning

Mexicans stated that Villa was
wounded at Guerrero. His followers
carried him to Te-mosachlc. where a
village doctor amputated the infected
leg, He later was taken to cusihulr
achic. whtre it was reported he died
and was burled secretly In a lonely
spot.
The rioting at Chihuahua which
was reported caused by excitement
over Villa's death, Is now attributed
to hunger. Small wages and famine
prices placed food beyond the reach
of poor families.
SAN ANTONIO. April 17. Persh
ing left for Cusihuirachlc today to
view the body exhumed near here,
which Mexicans claim is that of Villa.
He should give Funston positive ad

In a brief talk at the Wilson

E. T. Wade made a strong im
pression when she explained
why she. a registered republican,
is supporting President Wilson
for re-election. Mrs, Wade said
in part:

our president during the trouble
some months to come the strong,
forceful, courageous, yet careful

his impetuous belligerent oppo

a courage of no mean order for
the president to keep steadfastly

which is of far more Interest to
