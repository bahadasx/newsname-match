Wilson XW. Ferris, ae-ed 84. was'
found unconscious yesterday morning,
lying on the noor of his barn In Eas
ton. ' His throat had been slashed to
ribbons with a Jack knife thai lay at
his side. ' v ,"''
' rh Ernest H. Smith "of Redding, who
was caled to attend him. declared Mr
Ferris had attempted suicide. He is in
the Bridgeport hospital, with little
chance to live, ;. i .
According Dr.' Smith, Mr. Ferris
had been melancholy for many "months
and was afflicted with sleeplessness. A
few months ago his ' wife v died. He
had been living in his home near Rock
House Corners, near the Redding line,
with a caretaker. v . v
He ' ate , his breakfast yesterday
morning, acting moodily. Soon after
8 o'cloek t he went to the barn and
when he didn't return an investiga
tion was made. He was found nncua
scious, losing much blood from gashes
in his neck, '
" lr. Smith waseallea and he learned
that while the heck yiad been cuti
most to ribbons, no artery or import
ant vein was severed. ' He sewed the
cuts and Mr. Ferris was removee. to
the Bridgeport hospital in the auto
mobile of Randolph Bradley, . He re
covered consciousness on his way to
the hospital and in response to an in
quiry asserted : :"I can't sleep'
At the hospital It was said today
that his condition is very eritical. In
the opinion ef Dr. Smith he can't live
because of the great loss of blood, his
age and the likelihood of infection.
The dullness of the knife or the
feebleness ef Mr. Ferris prevented the
slashes from doing immediately fatal
damage.

HERVIE BURR'S
MEMORY POOR
DURING INQUIRY
Can't Recall Many Things
Connected With Burr &
Knapp Bankruptcy.
EXPENSE LISTED AS
ASSETS UPON BOOKS
Sixty Thousand Dollar Busi
ness Sold For Song, Is
New Disclosure.
" Failure of Hervie Burr, d'f the firm
of Burr & Knapp to recall many things
intimately connected with the defunct
banking concern's business featured
the inquiry, which began today.
interesting things were uruugui uuu
it was intimated that a $60,0.00 busi
ness had been sold for a mere song.
Expenses had been listed as assets,
was one assertion. A letter book, con
taining correspondence for the days
before' the bankruptcy is missing, it
was testified. ' t
The hearing Was begun before
John W.. Banks, referee in K bank
ruptcy, today. -
Hervie E. Burr, former member of
the bankrupt firm of Burr -Knapp
was summoned before the United
States District court to be ' examined
by Spottswood D. Bowers, special
prosecutor for the state. He was a
most reluctant witness, memory having
failed him on material points
which he is supposed to have acted
in a fiduciary capacity for Miss Anna
P. Penfield, the Georgia Loan & Trust
Co. aid others financially interested
in the concern. - .7 '.-
So poor was the memory of this
young banker about ' transactions in
which he is known to have taken part
that John C. Chamberlain, trustee,
was compelled to" comment to the ef
fect that it was surprising an officer
of a. banking firm should be found
to know so little of wh"p.t actually
happened within such a short space
of time after the events. -
It was disclosed 'from the proceed
ings today that ' the Title Guarantee
& Trust Co. is practically the same
concern as the defunct firm of Burr
& Knapp, . haying the same business.
books, etc., as did Burr & Knapp
without the banking business and one
clerk, that was formerly employed by
Burr & Knapp.
, An attempt made by Attorney ,Bow
ers to ascertain what became t of the
stock of the old City" Guarantee &
Safe Deposit Co. .disclosed that' 1,006
shares of this concern were sold by
the receiver for $300. .. The witness
under examination .today swore that
this business was 'worth between $60,
000 and $70,000. , , . -v
Another feature that was brought
out in the inquiry divulged that the
Burr & Knapp books disclose that
aiy automobile account was carried
on the books as assets tto the amount
of $12,000. Testimony of Hervie Bun
was to the effect that these assets
were in reaUty liabilities.
Attorney- John C. Chamberlain,
who Interposed remarks -throughout
decelared that a close examination of
the books probably would show that
the autaomobiles eventually would be
found not charged as disclosed ; by
the investigator, and that the last- was
sold for $350 having cost, when new,
$1,200.
It was also disclosed that Hervie
Burr who apparently had much to
do ; in the Burr & Knapp's business
conduct, but could remember little
until telegrams and documents were
shown 'him . to refresh his memory,
was left to closet the doors when the
failure : occurred, Herbert M. Knapp
having left the city earlier in the
morning after he had ordered the re
ceivership.
In explanation of the sale of City
Guarantee and Safe Deposit stock for
a' paltry sum, Trustee John C. Cham
berlain later said that this stock rep
resented the entire patrimony of
Charles Knapp, who had spent nearly
$40,000 in getting the records and
$10,000 for the use of J. P. Morgan's
system of bookkeeping. He said that
this stock had greatly depreciated -un
til it was finally sold, toy the Bullards
to. him for $2,500. .An equal equity
in the business had previously been
bought by1 Herbert M. Knapp. Charles
Knapp he said, is working for $12 per
wee today. i '
The only statement that Attorney
Bowers would make today regarding
the proceedings before Referee Banks
was:
"I ami here to "finfl out if funds have
gone Into other hands through, prefer
ence or otherwise, which should not
be in possession of theereditors. And
I am going to find out. ' - r
That there has 'been considerable
friction, regarding the procuring 4 of
necessary infprmation regarding the
various deals that resulted in tne 'li
tis Guarantee & Trust Co. getting the
stock and - business of the Burr
Knapp- and some of its co-related
companies, was evident from the tes
timony today. . (
A letter book ' of the Burr & Knapp
firm havinsr the v correspondence of
the company just prior to its failure,
Is missing. Certain other checks and
telegrams are said not to toe found
and it was primarily to. ascertain what
Nl became of these documents that Her
vie Burr was placed on the witness
stand. He declared that he was
neither secretary of. the Burr & Knapp
firm, or the Title Guarantee "trust
Co., as had 'been supposed. -
Failure of young Knapp to recall
whether he had been given money to
purchase 'the stock of the City Guar
antee & Safe Deposit Co.. by Miss
Anna Penfield or whether he pur
chased the stock .directly for the TiUle
Guarantee , & Trust Co. caused Attor
ney Bowers to ask that he be com
pelled by the court to produce the
books of the latter company to show
Just what the transaction involved.
At this Juncture John C. Charaber
alin, as an officer to that company de
clared that the books would be placed
at Mr. Bowers' disposal in their of
fice. 1
"All right," replied Mr. Bowers, "I

Miss Rosalind Robinson, 14-year-old
daughter . of Li-eutenant- Commander
H. H. S. Robinson, naval constructor
at the Lake Torpedo Boat Co., will of
ficially 'baptize the first submarine to
be launched under her father's regime
at the local plant.
The ceremonies of the launching of
the L-4, construction of which was
begun on May 14, 1914, will be" sim
ple. Besides the sual naval inspect
ors, only a few invited guests and of
ficials of the company will be present.
It is expected that the submarine,
which is now almost ready to go
overboard, will slide easily, into the
high tide May 1. All Miss "Robinson
will have tp do is to stand upon- the
specially constructed platform and as
the bow begins to slip away, break
the specially prepared bottle of cham
pagne and say, VI christen thee L-4.",
The L-4 is one of 11 of the same
class, which were authorized by Con
gress in 1912, and contracted for dur
ing the two subsequent years. It was
not until April 24, 1914,. that the Lake
Co.'s. contracts were finally awarded.
They are building besides the L-4 to.
this city, the L-6 and L-7. on the Pa
cific coast. , These boats also are ex
pected to be" launched May 1. It will
be some six months later that the" of
ficial tests will be made for acceptance
by the government,
The Electric Boat Co., which receiv
ed contracts for similar type boats a
year previous to the Lake Co., has al
ready . completed several of these1
boats.' v They are about 165 ,feet in
length, displace about 580 tons, and
are capable of traveling at a rate of
14 knots on the surface and 10 when
submerged. In . addition to the tor-yT
pedo tube armament which is said tol
have a lateral radius, disappearing
rifles are to be mounted on the super
structure. r
They are f the heavy oil hurtling
type .for engine propulsion on the sur
face and electrically - driven when
Submerged. .. The contract price was
585,600 for" the L-4.- Those built on
the Pacific coast were awarded at
$560,000. each. '
Though the Lake Co. in v this city
has .been growing with rapid strides,
no submarines have been . launched
here since the C-8 in . 191 2 and as a
completely new construction manage

which were awarded on Oct. 18, 1915.
These boats will not to be launched

JTJAEEZ AWAITS CONFIRMATION".
El Paso, April 1 7 Corff irmation of
Mexican reports that Francisco Villa's
body had been exhumed at San Fran
cisco Borja and" was being brought to
Chihuahua .City was still lacking at
the headquarters of the de facto gov
ernment at Juarez today.
Gabriel Garza, commander of the
Juarez garrison, awaited information
from, official sources that would dispel
doubt over the reported finding of the
bandit's bodybut .the telegraph lines
were silent on the subject. ' '
"I still feel reasonably certain that
the messages ; received Sunday ' that
'Villa's body had been found is cor
rect,", said Andres Garcia, "Mexican
consul here,, today. "I " shall v make
every effort to have, the body brought
to Juarez, where Americans who know
him may make identification that wiU
be satisfactory to the people"" -.
- The de -facto - government officials
were not able to give any information
regarding the unofficial despatch' from
Mexico City stating that Minister of
War Obregon had - announced that
Villa's body was buried at San Fran
cisco Borja and was not enroute to
Chihuahua City. '. It was believed here
that there was some difficulty in the
telegraphic and cable transmission of
the despatches. Consul Garcia's in
formation was that the body of Villa
had ; been exhumed'"at San Francisco
Borja and was being .brought into
Cusihuriachic, whence it 'was. to be
sent on a special train to Chihuahua
City. v ' J '
Official word from Washington that
the United States troops would be im
mediately withdrawn from Mexico if
Villa ' was ' dead undoubtedly, will re-s
suit in expediting ,the efforts of thex
de facto government to ascertain the
truth of the reports of the locating of
Villa's body. If the supposed body
of the bandit is still interred at San,
Francisco Borja, as stated", in latest
Mexico City advices. it wlil likely be
many days, before an identification
can be made unless the "Mexican gov
ernment accepts yas final the identifi
cation made by Carranza officers now
in the vicinity of San Francisco Borja,
which is 30 miles by trail south of
Cusihuirischic.
Identification of the body at' this
time may prove baffling. According
to the reports from Mexico City, Villa
