BATTLE OF VERDUN
Most Gigantic .Conflict in Khtoiy
of World Wars
LOSSES FR1GH1FILIY HEAVY
Destruction of Human Life Exceeds
That In Anv Other Camoalan of
Present Struaale.
London, April 16. The most gigan
tic conflicts in the history of the world
the battle of Verdun, has entered upon
its ninth week. The enormous scale
of the German preparations and execu
tion of the attack, the unparalleled con
centratlon of artillery and the sustain1
ed ferocity of the fighting 'efforts lot
ed ferocity of the fighting marked the
battle as one of the great efforts of
the war.
Another French counter attack , In
the region aouth of Douaumont ori the
east bank of the Meuse, was BncCess
fully carried out late yesterday after
noon. Gorman trench elements against
which the attack was directed, were
captured and 200 prisoners, including
two officers were taken.
The lull in the German offensive in
the Verdun region, which has been In
terpreted as indicating elaborate prep
arations for a resumption of the at
tack, still continues. No attempt was
made at an advance by the German
infantry last night or today, but the
German heavy artillery directed a
heavy bombardment today against the
section Bois d'Avocourt Hill 304
where the Germans have expended
much of their energy recently. Both
German and French artillery was en
gaged today In the Douaumont region
and there were scattered artillery
duels in the Woevre.
Verdun has been rated as one of the
strongest fortresses of Europe, a cor
herstone of the French defenses
eealnst Germany. The evolution of
military tactics during the war, how
ever, and particularly the employment
by the Germans of long range howitz
era,' capable of reducing the greatest
forts, have done much to change the
character of the Verdun campaign
from the earlier conceptions of such a
struggle.
Before the battle opened the
French partly dismantled their fort?
around Verdun and placed chief re
liance for resistance on an elaborate
system of trenches.
In no previous battle were the losses
as high as those which have been es
tlmated In the fighting around Verdun.
These estimates, however, cannot be
regarded as conclusive evidence, for
neither Germany nor France has an
nounced its own casualties. The
French war office has declared the
Germans have lost 200,000 in killed
wounded and captured. The Germans
state semi-officlally that the French
casualties number 150,000 killed and
wounded and that 3(5,000 unwounded
French prisoners have been taken
Taking these estimates nearly 400,00"
men have been eliminated as fighting
units.
The ground occupied by the Ger
mans after fifty-six days of offensive
operations may be roughly calculated
as 100 square miles. They have forced
back the French from their outlying
positions to their definite line of re
slstance along the semi-circular front
from the edge of the Argonne east
ward across the Meuse and southward
into the woevre. For tho mobt part
this main line has withstood the shock
of successive attacks.

in., fact. the water was so clear that
careful fishing was required to escape

Furnace brook was the most fre

ty and every fisherman, even the boys,
secured trout. Some of the catches
were not large but they were better
than those reported on opening days in
previous years. The best record for Fur

REPORTED DEATH
OF VILLA HOT
ii
Americans Who Know Bandit Wi l
View BoJy at Chihuahua
MU MEAN END OF EXPEDITION
United States Troops Will Be With
drawn Once It Is Proved Villa
is Dead.
San Antonio, Tex., April 17. Lack
ing official advices confirming tho
rumored deatli of I'ancho Villa, the
Mexican bandit leader, (Jen Funstou
has not yet made any changes In his
plan of campaign. Col. Pershing has
teen informed that Villa is in hiding ,
in the mountains west of Parral.
' Several Americans who know Villa .
are on a train today bound for Chilnia- j
hua where the body said to be tliut of j
the. bandit chieftain is expected to ar
rive before night.
Washington, April 17. American
troops will be withdrawn from Mexico
immediately if Francisco Villa is dead.
Administration officials made this un
qualified statement last night com
menting on reports from Mexican
sources that the bandit's body had
been discovered and was being taken
from Cusilmirlachle to Chihuahua Citv
by special train. Neither the state nor
war department had any confirmatory I
advices on the subject from American
ources. Reports reaching Kl Paso
and fThpr hnrdnr nninta u-,ir fnfunvl. '
ed for information, but neither Ameri-!
can consuls nor military authorities in
Mexico were heard from.
There was no attempt at Washing
ton to disguise the eager interest in
tha reported killing of the. bandit.
Every message received was closely
scrutinized at tho stato department
and sent to the White House. In some
quarters there was a disposition to
credit them notwithstanding the fact
that border reports generally have
been viewed with so much suspicion
since the pursuit tegan.
Ollklals would not discuss what
proof they would deem necessarv to
establish the fact that the body men
tioned In these reports is that of
Villa. It is certain, however, that
every effort will be made to obtain so
complete an identification as to make
sure beyond reasonable doubt that
the man who waged war with a few
hundred bandits against the United
States and the de facto government
it' Mexico simultaneously has paid the
penalty. Consul Letcher at Chihua
hua should be able to make the identi
fication .
Customs Collector Cobb at El Paso
notified the state department late yes
terday that Mexican customs officials
at Juarez hud told him the body of
the bandit had been found and would
be taken last night to Chihuahua City.
The Mexican embassy earlier had re
vived the following message from
Mexican Consul Garcia at El Paso:
'The telegraph operators at Custi
and Madera have informed nie that
they have found the body of Fran
cisco Villa and that It will be con
ducted to Chihuahua."
San Antonio, Tex., April 17. It was
force of Carranza soldiers who en
gaged the little detachment of Ameri
can cavalry at Parral Wednesday in a
regularly organized action, according
to a detailed report written bv Maj.
Frank Tompkins and forwarded to
Gen. Funstnn yesterday by Gen. Persh
ing.
Forty of the Mexican soldiers, in
cluding one major and one civilian
were killed by the retreating Amer
icans. The American casualties were
two killed and six wounded, the lat
ter including Maj. Tompkins. His
wound was slight.
Maj. Tompkins' account of the ac
tion was received at Gen. Funston's
headquarters last night and served to
clarify Gen. Pershing's report received
Saturday in which the Indentlty of the
attacking force was not stated and
!n which he left the Inference Hint the
cavalry was under Col. V. C. Brown.
The Americans now an north and
west of Parral, reinforced by a squad
ron of the loth cavalry under
Maj. Young, accompanied by Col. W
C. Brown and a picked squadron un
der Maj. Robert Mowse. Fears for
their safety have been dispelled by
this report and by troop dispositions
that Gen. Pershing has ordered, but
tho character of which Gen. Funstou
did not wish to reveal.
Maj. Tompkln's story of the fight
indicates hick of control over tho
troops by the commanding ollicer of
the Parral garrison, Gen. Lozniio, nnd
bitter antagonism! by tho public and
troops, The fighting took place out
side of Parral and was continued over
a route of eight miles to Santa Cruz
n station eight miles northeast of Par
ral on the railroad.
Gen. Funslon said Inst night that
while Maj. Tompkins undoubtedly act
ed In accordance with his best Judg
ment in retreating, he regretted ho
had not made a stand on account of
the Ill-effects tho story of his retreat
CONFIRMED
would have on the Mexican people,
who will naturally regard the Incident
as an American defeat.
Maj. Tompkins arrived outside Par
ral on the forenoon of April 12 with
two troops, M and K of the 13th cav
alry, reduced in number. The total
of these two troops is approximately
100 men. Tho report that unarmed
men went into Parral appears to have
been erroneous. Maj. Tompkins admits
that he did march his small detach
ment quite openly along the trail into
the city, where they were met by Gen
Lozano, who received them most gra
ciously. The civil authorities arrived
and joined in the courteous reception
of the major and his troops. The in
cident appeared to be progressing
without unpleasant features. Gen Lo
zano and the civil authorities dis
cussed with Maj. Tompkins the quest
ion of camping, he and the local offici
als deciding on a site just outside the
city to which Maj. Tompkins was di
rected. Maj. Tompkins entered the town on
the invitation of an ollicer of the Par
ral garrison. He stated that the offi
cer met him 10 miles from Parral,
introduced himself and urged him to
accept the hospitality of the military
and civil authorities. This fact,
oupled with Maj. Tompkins' report of
the subsequent attack, Caused officials
at San Antonio to express the opinion
that he and his men had been de
liberately led into a trap, although
perhaps not with the knowledge of
Gen. Lczano, commanding ollicer.
Maj. Tompkins was preparing to
move out to the designated camp when
soldiers and civilians began to throw
stones and to shoot at. the Americans.
Realizing that the action was that of
a mob of civilians and of soldiers who
had gotten beyond the control of their
otlicers, Maj. Tompkins made no stand,
but retired his men without making
resistance toward the city limits.
Shouting crowds followed them with
out doing great damage.
It was afternoon when Tompkins
led his men into a defensive position
behind a railway embankment outside
the town. The mob respected the ad
vantage the Americans had taken,
but roon there appeared on their flank
I1 forc; of Me? Uf ? troI,s' ho
ut-Kaii m iiimiiw Kisiiioii a lormai at
tack. Maj. Tompkins was still averse
to fighting in anything but a defen
sive manner against this force, since
every ollicer who has entered Mexico
with the punitive force lias had it im
pressed, upon him that clashes with
the troops of the de facto government,
who are supposed to be cooperating
with them in their pursuit of Villa
and his bandits, must be avoided. Also
it soon became apparent that the
Mexicans' superiority in numbers
mane a retreat from the position be
hind the embankment imperative.
A retreat was begun that was end
d only at Santa Cruz. The Mexicans
pursued them almost the entire dis
tance of the intervening eight miles,
the Americans contenting themselves
with a rear guard action. In the run
ning flcht the Americans cared for
their dead and wounded.
Y. M. C. A. PLUMBING SHOP
Now Provides a Net Income of $12 a
Month.
Our Y. M. C. A. building was com
leted anil occupied Just about nine
years ago. I ho building committee,
true to their agreement, had kept the
ost within tho amount subscribed.
nuipplng the building. however,
there were some $f,uii of unpaid ac-
ounts. The question was what to do?
It did not see wise to solicit the
funds at that time, and the suggestion
was made that the plumbing shop be
used as security for an $800 loan. That
$200 of the amount be used to raise.
provide foundation and repairs to put
shop In rentable condition, and that
the rentals be used to liquidate said
note. This suggestion ' was adopted
and Dec. 2, 19o7 a note of $800 wa
executed. A local party advanced the
money nml llomer Ji.: Webster was
made trustee, to manage, the property
At the last meeting of the Board of
Directors the trustee, made his fln.il
report, stating amounts, paid out for
insurance, taxes duel repairs, also
that the original note of $S00 had been
paid together with $217.20 Interest on
seme and a balance (heck of $10.5f
drawn to the treasurer of the Y. M. C.
A.
In the meantime tho trustees had
collected the sum of $1,094.50 in rentals
from this shop. It shows how small
sums count up and how they mny
sometimes be used to bridge n gap or
meet a need.
The ending of this trusteeship
makes available to the Y. M. C. A.
new gross income of $12 per month.

The twenty-fourth annual meeting of
The Fortnightly on Saturday afternoon
at the Congregational chaflet marked
the end of a most successful. season
and left the club with n very promising

The opening business session presented
Interesting annual reports of Die secre

ing a balance in the treasury large
enough to allow the club to vot a full
ten cent per capita donation of $31.9'
to the State Federation Scholarship
fund and $:! to the travelling library

The nominating committee reported
nearly an entire list of new officers,
the secretary being the only exception.
Tlieyp otbeers were unanimously elect
ed; Mrs. Frank E. Howe, president,
Mrs. II. MacGregor Hitclile, vice-presi
dent; Mrs. Walter K. -Miutison. secre
tary; .MIS. William ft. lio.Mium, i.caa

Henry W. Tirrell, closes the term of
three years of active service to the
club and hearty appreciative of her
work was voiced by the members
through their representative Mrs. G.
S. Mills, and by the presentation of a
hemitiful boumut of roses. In re
sponding, Mrs. Tirrell thanked the club
members for their unfailing loyalty
md co-operation in the club work, and
die later, in welcoming the new presi

ng the meeting was the recipient of
ninny congratulations find kindly
werds of welcome to her new ofllce.
Tho musical and literary program on
"Bird Life In Bennington" prepared by
Mrs. Lucretius S. Boss, was one of the
tho sinking fund account and the
money used for extensions.
The trustees planned to wait until
the funds accumulated to nearly
enough to build tho hospital which
from plans secured will be somewhere
around ninety thousand dollars. This
new gift by Henry W. Putnam, jr., will
enable the erection of the hospital this
year without using tho accumulated
funds already on hand except as may
be 'needed-to equip the plant.'
The plans are all ready and prices
were secured on the erection of tho
hospital last year, but it was found
that it would leave the institution too
much in debt and it was decided to
wait until the fund had grown to larg
er proportions.
'A. W. Braisted and Fred P. Mor-'
house were in New York a few days
ago and met Mr. Putnam and tho
above letter from him was received by
Mr. Braisted.
At the Putnam office has arrived a
fine bronze bust of the late Henry W.
Putnam. This bust will eventually bo
placed in the new hospital, but for the
present it has been placed on a pedes
tal at the Putnam office where it may
bo seen.
It is a lifelike representation of Mr.
Putnam as he appeared at the age of
about fiO to t;5, during the. years when
he was in the most active part of his
caree:.
The bust is of heroic size and it
was made by the famous New York
sculptor O'Niell.' He had only photo
graphs to go by. but as he proceeded
with the clay cast he culled in Mr.
Putnam's son, Mr. Morhouse, Mr.
Braisted and others who knew how
Mr. Putnam looked. The result is
that the bust is a wonderful likeness
of Bennington's great benefactor.
best presented this season and gave
great pleasure as well as Instruction,
mo nrst paper by Dr. L. 1L Ross con
tained so much valuable and interest
ing data of the economic value of birds
to the farm and orchard that it will he
printed in lull at an early data. Mrs.
Ross told a number of experiences
within the town limits which sounded
almost like fairy tales to the unobserv
ant citizen who cannot tell a lark from
a sparrcw. It is a privilege to hear a
program on birds prepared by genuine
bird lovers and the audience enjoyed
it to the full as their applause testi
fied. The exhibit of mounted birds
loaned by Chelsea Harrington and Mrs.
William H. Bradford was a most in
structive part of the program and was
much appreciated.
The musical numbers were beautiful
ly rendered and were of added valun
as the club had tho use of a cabinet,
grand piano shipped from the Ivers
and Pond factory especially for this
meeting. Its sweet tone was a fitting
accompaniment to the bird songs and
duets sung by Mrs. Amyel Baker and
Mrs. L. H. Boss witn Mrs. Arthur .1.
Holden at the piano". Mrs. Holden al
so played with fine artistry the Liszt
transcription of Schubert's "Hark
Hark the Larks," "The Little Birds"
by Grieg and Moskowski's "Spring
Soiif,-."
' The social tea which closed the af
ternoon was arranged by Mrs. War-
wfei S. Carpenter and Mrs. II. Mac
Gregor Ritchie. The ten table, beauti
fully decorated with pink roses, was
presided. over by Mrs. Anna Carpenter
and Mrs. Arthur J. Holden, who were
assisted in serving by ten young
ladies. An abundant supply of dainty
refreshments and much sociability
brought to a close cue of the. most suc
cessful years in the history of the club.
