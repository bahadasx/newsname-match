Pear Cannery
For Rogue Valley
The establishment ot a huge pear
cannery In the Rogue River valley,
probably at Medford, is an lmlnent
possibility. Libby, McNeil & Libby,
the largest cannery operators in the
world, will send Philip Larmon, their
general manager, and Mr. Marrow,
superintendent of their California
plants, to the valley this week to ar
range preliminary details for the es
tablishment of a pear cannery for the
coming season, providing the assur
ance of sufficient tonnage for the sea
son can be secured. The Libby people
will pay 30 a ton, run of orchard,
f. o. b. plant, and some of the promi-
nent fruit men are quoted as stating
that this price is better than a dollar
a box net to the grower and saves
the expense of packing, shipping and
refrigerating and the ever-present
liability of a poor market. The es
tablishment of the cannery will put
pear growing on an absolutely solid
and substantial business basis.
This good news was brought to
Medford Friday by County Commis
sioner Frank H. Madden on his re
turn from Seattle, where he inter
ested Libby, McNeil & Libby. This
year the concern erected a cherry
cannery at The Dalles. They own

Mohair Pool Brings
Total of $4,800
Approximately $4,800 in cold hard
cash wag paid to the Angora goat
raisers of this vicinity last Saturday I
afternoon for the mohair produced
this year. The price paid was $42.55
per hundred pounds and is a top
notch price for mohair, ranging high
er than the prevailing price in the
east. The bair was pronounced to
be of extra fine quality.
Ten thousand pounds of mohair
was sold, being the pooled product of
the goatmen. This pool represents
all but a few small lots of the mohair
grown in the valley this year. The
goatmen represented in the pool were
C. W. Banta and sons, Davis and

Big Addition
To Oregon Hotel
Plans have been drawn for an ad
dition to the Hotel Oregon which will
cover approximately -10 by 140 feet
and be two stories in height. The ad
dition will bo an extension on the
east enu ot tne notet to rioneer av-
enue and down Pioneer avenue to the
alley at the rear of the hotel prop-j
cv- I
The arcade across the front of the 1
hotel will be extended to the corner.
The addition will be built of concrete.
The entire lower floor will be given
over to an immense garage which it
is rumored will be occupied by F. L.
Camps. Facing on Main street will
be a display room 43 by 33 feet.
The garage proper will have a floor
space of 40 by 104 and will have an
entrance on Pioneer avenue. This
will give an immense storage space
and workshop room. x
The second story will be divided
into seventeen spacious rooms with
baths. First class in every particu-;
lar, making a fine addition to the i
hotel equipment. j
The contract has not been let and i
plans are still in rather an embryoticj
state, but the erection of the addition j
seems assured.

party will arrive Tuesday evening
from Klamath Falls and will be
boused at the Swigart residence dur
ing their stay in Ashland.
Juniors Take
Meet From School
The Junior track meet held Friday
at the high school athletic field was
a grand success in every way. The
only drawback to the day whatever
was that it rained some and was
rather cold. This probably made the
average time In the races higher
than it would have been had it been
warmer. Much new material was
listed in the meet and some of it will
probably develop into very good
track men. It is hard to pick out
anv narticular star, tint nrnhnhlv
race. The juniors challenged the
school and, as is usually the way in
a ease like this, got away with it.
The final score was M to 43 in favor
of the juniors. The score was count
ed five points on the first place, three
on the second and one on the third.
The contestants in the events were

Billie Burke in
"Peggy" This Week
The premier moving picture attrac
tion of the year, Billie Burke In
"Peggy," has been secured by Man
ager Bergner of the Vining Theatre
for Ashland ahead ot all the towns
in the valley and will be shown on
Thursday and Friday of this week.
This Is the biggest attraction ever
thrown on the local screen. "Peggy"
i has been showing for weeks In Port-
"Peggy" received more space in
the Portland papers during the weeks j
the play was showing than did Villa.
The winsome Idol of the stage is said
tn he simply irresistible in the Scotch
1 :;.y .;ory.
In Portland tho manager of the
Columbia Theatre was arrested be
cause the crowds which came to see
Billie liurke blockaded the streets.
In Spokane tho picture showed for
six weeks to unprecedented crowds.
In 0;:!iland the theatre manuger ran
"midnight matinees" to accommo
date the crowds. It Is undoubtedly
the "one picture'' of the year.
The story of "Peggy" Is that of a
member of the Scottish clan of Cani-
eron, plunged in, the midst of New
York revelry, who is ordered to Scot
land by her uncle and guardian, a
role masterfully handled Ty William
II. Thompson. Tho hoydenish lass

Scotch village and shocks the natives
by traveling on Sunday and breaking

stem guardian by donning overalls
to tinker with her car, and then, In a
sack suit of her cousin's, Journeys
forth Into the night, Is caught In a
storm, and takes refuge In tho village

woven Into the story, whllo a flash of
tragedy is introduced through an af
fair between Cameron's son, Colin,
and the weaver's (laughter. Peggy
decides to return to America alter
bringing tho couplo together, but the
minister (William Desmond) per

May Electrify S. P.
Over Siskiyous
Electrification of the Southern Pa
clfic railroad over the Siskiyous i3
beingrfonsidered by the Southern Pa
cific officials, and two surveys havo
been made by the company engineers
completely covering the project. A.
II. Bahcock, chief electrical etigineer
of the company, testified before tho
California state railroad commission
Friday that both the Siskiyou electri
fication and the electrification of tho
Southern Pacific lines over the Sier
ras was feasible. Negotiations have
already been entered into with tho
California-Oregon Power Company;
for power.
The cost of the electrification ot
the Siskiyous would be enormous, but
trains could be taken over the grades
at a very small proportion of the
present cost when completed. Ash
land would most likely be the north
ern terminus of the electrical unit of
the road, and should it be accom
plished a complete upheaval In rail
road circles here would result.
The California-Oregon Company la
putting in electrical units on the
Klamath river and at Fall creek
which will develop more current than
can be used commercially In their
territory for years to come, and that
their intention is to provide a sourco
of supply for the electrification unit
seems most possible.

Gardner Replies
To Strictures
To the Medford Mail Tribune:
Relative to the registration matters
ot which you have been so freely at
tacking me, will say that I have been
following the law according to tho
opinion of tho attorney-general of
Oregon, which Is superior to the ad
vice of the county attorney.
If the registrations havo not been
properly taken care of, why have yon
not had your county attorney bring;
mandamus proceedings and the mat
ter could have been settled In a few
days. G. A. GARDNER.
