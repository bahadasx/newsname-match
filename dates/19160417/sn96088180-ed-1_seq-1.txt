of. General Venustlano Carranza, Is
declared to have exhumed Villa's re

neither , he nor General Gavlra In
Juares had any confirmation of the
report that Villa's body had been re
covered or Identified. J' Anyhow, they
said. It would be difficult to establish
the body's Identity on account of the
length. of time It had .been .burled
and owing to the character 'of the
disease from "which it was reported
Villa died.
' "If Colonel Carlos Carranxa says

him and Is dependable. If he says
It Is Villa. I will give no attention to
