One American Wounded When
Submarine Shells Russian
Steamer Imperator.
With relation- with Germany
strained to the breaking point, the
United States Government was
L.-ought into direct conflict with
Austria today.
An official report to the Stato
Department today told of the shell
ing without warning of the Rus
sian steamer Imperator by an Aus
trian submarine.
One American waV. bounded.
Another was saved. '
If the facts are shown to bear
out the preliminary report the
same demand for an accountinj
will be made upon Austria that is
to be made upon Germany in the
note now ready for transmission to
Berlin.
CONSULAR REPORT.
The attack upon the Imperator wai
reported by Carl Ballny Hurst, consul
general at Barcelona. Spain. The State.
Department gave out the following
paraphrase of his retort:
"Russian ship Imperator, cargo tim
ber, from Gulfport, Miss, to Mar
seilles, France thrice shot at with
cannon without warning Vessel net
on Are by Austrian submarine near the
Colu mbrede Islands.
"Two American citizens In crew, Gus
tave Olson and Abner Bwennsson.
Former Is now In hospital with shrap
nel wounds. Bwennsson Is uninjured.
Swennsson's father Is band leader at
Fort Warren, Boston. Olsen ha brother
who Is foreman of Bergengarden Fur
niture at Minneapolis."
Secretary Lansing said he would de
sire further Information before taking
action,
Mr. Lansing also was unable to say
whether the note to Germany would go
forward today. He would not say that
fnere wa any reason for delay.
The Secretary denied that there had
been nny dispatches from Ambassador
Gerard In the last forty-eight hours
that had prompted a change In the
plan of the Administration to dispatch
the note to Berlin Immediately.
No Change Apparent.
Unofficial advices said Gerard had In
formed the State Department of a con
ciliatory attitude on the part of the Ger
man government that was expected to
relieve tension over the, submarine
Issue.
Thore Is no apparent change In tho
Intentions of the President to go ahead
with his policy of demanding Immedi
ately from Germany binding assurances
of her Intention to keep faith with the
United States and live up to her pledges
govornlng submarine warfare.
President Wilson has no appointment
with Chairmen Stone and Flood, of tho
Foreign Relations Committees of tho
two houses.
He Is expected to confer with them
beforo sending tho new communication
to Berlin. This gave rise to the belief
that action will bo deferred another

prove Program Which Provides Features
Urging Defense of Nation.
President Wilson paid his respects to the patriotic work of the
Daughters of the American Revolution at the opening of the afternoon
session of the twenty-fifth continental congress, which began today at
Continental Memorial Hall.
The President extended to the congress the greetings of the Na
tional Government.
Response was made by Mrs. William Cummings Story, president
general of the D. A. R. Addresses were also made by Newell B.
Woodworth, president general of the Society of Sons of the American
Revolution, and by W. I. Lincoln Adams, president of the New Jersey
S. A. R.
The firm quality of preparedness sentiments of the delegates was
sounded at the first session, and the friends of Mrs. Story gained for
their leader a vote of confidence which they believe is evidence of the
way in which the factional disturbances which might break out during
the congress will be settled.

MONDAY EVENING,
COURT ORDERS I
NEW ML FOR
W. E. AMBROSE
Justice Robb Reverses Convic
tion of Embezzlement in
Lower District Tribunal.
FINDS NO EVIDENCE OF FRAUD
Opinion Also Declares Judge
Erred in Not Admitting Tes
timony for Defendant.
William E. Ambrose, sentenced
to ten yriars imprisonment on the
charge of embezzlement in tho
District Supreme Court, will get a
new trial. The District Court oi
Appeals so decided today in re
versing the judgment of the lower
court.
The reversal was based on er
rors of the lower court in failing
to admit as evidence certain state
ments supporting the 'actions of
the defendant, and in permitting
the Government, over the objection
of defendant's counsel, to inquire
into various cases in which Am
brose had acted in a fiduciary ca
pacity prior to the case at bar.
BASED ON LIMERICK CASE.
The Ambrose prosecution resulted
from his services as guardian of the
Limerick children. It was altered he
converted to his own use the fiduciary
funds.
The opinion of the Appellate Court,
written bv Associate Justice Robb. In
which the Chief Justice concurs, holds
that the .question of "evil Intent to de
fraud" Is an essential element In the
crltye alleged.
The Limerick funds were kept bv Am
brose with his personal assets. Touch
ing on this fact. Justice Robb says:
"While, of course, it is the better way
for a guardian to keen monev of his
ward entirclv separate from his own.
the mere fact that he does not do so
affords no sufficient basts for a pre
sumption of evil Intent."
No Law Violated, Says Robb.
Referring to the Government's case,
the opinion sums up the evidence
against Ambrose as "tending to show
conversion of funds."
No statute or rule of the court, Jus
tice Robb declares, was shown to have
been violated, and "there was no evi
dence upon which the Jury legitimately
could have based a finding that there
had been a fraudulent conversion of
these funds."
The Appellate Court holds that the
evidence offered bv Ambrose ihnwlnr
.payment to the wards of rmount due
mem, ana wnicn was rejected by the
lower court, should have been admitted.
The trial court also 1m mm tn hum
erred in admitting "evidence of .other
similar offenses," when no connection
wiiii me vubo ai utLT was snown.
The prosecution of Ambrose In the
lower court waa handled by H. McComas
Hawken, then Assistant District Attor
ney. The case beforo the Appellate
Court was presented by District Attor
ney iasKey ana Assistant District At
torney Van Fleet on behalf of th finv
ernment. Ambrose was represented in
uom inounaia or Attorney James b.

SAN ANTONIO, Tex., April 1 7. Brigadier General
Pershing left Cusihuiriachic with a cavalry detachment to
view the body being brought to Chihuahua, claimed to be
that of Villa, it is announced at headquarters today.
Pershing should be able to give posive advices in a few;
hours as to whether the body is that of the fugitive bandit,
unless the corpse is in such a condition as to prevent iden
tification. Dispatches from El Paso state that a train carrying a
party of Americans left there about daybreak for Chihua
hua City. Man of the party knew the bandit leader, and
the purpose of the trip is to make a complete identification.
Juarez officials, who gave out the first reports of the
finding of Villa's body, have received no official,confirma
tion. '!. ij
"It's a four-to-one shot that Villa is dead," is the wayj
Consul Garcia summed the situation up this morning.
SENDS FOR VILLA SURGEON.
Major General Funston today wired army officers at
Douglas, Ariz., to look up a Dr. Wickman, who treated
Villa for months last fall, and have him view the body. To
make the identification more certain, Funston also sent out;
queries seeking other men who have known Villa more 01
less intimately during his recent career.
Funston declared he had no information on which to)
base a surmise that the body exhumed is Villa's. But hq
laid emphasis on the fact that the point where the body was
found is near the region where Major Howse reported
Villa's latest operations the La Borja region. Howzo
knew beyond question that Villa was in that section, it i$
stated, but the time was not made clear.
ESCAPED VILLA ARMY.
Dr. Wickman, who treated Villa for blood disease,
was held captive for two months in order to assure the ban
dit medical attednance. He escaped the Villistas' army
when the forces reached a point near Douglas, and army
officials lost track of him.
Funston said he personally would not view the body,
even if it were Villa's and brought to the border to be seen
by the American officials.
No further information on the fight and rioting at
Parral had reached headquarters today.
The only reports received stated that portions of the
Tenth, Eleventh, and Thirteenth cavalry were now sta
tioned at Santa Cruz, prepared to defend the position or
take up the pursuit again.
Americans Sent South
To Identify Villa Body
EL PASO, April 17. If Villa is dead, as reported,
army officials here are anxious that the body of the bandit
leader be identified by Americans, as well as Mexicans.
. A train left Juarez forChihuahua before daw ntoday
with a small group of Americans, including t number who
knew him intimately. They expect to meet at Chihuahua
the body taken from the lonely grave in the mountains
west of Satevo which Carranza authorities say is that of
Villa. The grave was pointed out by a former Villista
colonel in return for amnesty.
It is generally supposed here that if Villa is dead the
American soldiers will soon be withdrawn from Mexico.
All indications are that this story of the Villa end is re-
