El Paso, April 17. Confirmation of
Mexican reports that Francisco Villa's
body bad been exhumed at San Fran
cisco Borja and was being brought to
Citfhaahua, was still lacking at' the
headquarters of the tie facto govern
ment at Juarez today.
Gabriel Gavira, commander of the
Juarez garrison, awaited information
from official sources that would dispel
any question of doubt over the reports
of the finding of the bandit's body but
no messages regarding Villa were re
ceived. "I still feel reasonably certain that
the message received Sunday over the
Mexican land lines that Villa's body
had been found is correct," said An
dres Garcia, Mexican consul here, to
day. "I shall make every effort to have
the body brought to Juarez, where
scores of American whd knew him
may make an investigation that will
be completely satisfactory to the
American people. We should have
some official information about the
Villa reports today."
Are Without Information.
De facto government officials were
not able to give any information re
garding an unofficial dispatch from
Mexico City stating that Minister of
War Otircgon had announced that
Villa's body vas buried at San Fran
Cisco liorja and was not enroute to
Chihuahua City.
Of'H-ial word from Washington that
the I "ii it od States troops would be im
lueriiaiely withdrawn from Mexico If
Villa was dead will undoubtedly re
sult in expediting the efforts of the de
facto government to ascertain the
truth of the reports of the locating of
Villa's body and to make a full and
fcatisf yiitg identification. If the sup
pled body of the bandit is still inter
red at San Francisco Borja, as stated
in latest Mexico City advices, it will
likely be many days before an identi
fication can be made unless the Mex
ican government accepts as final the
identifiation made by Carranza officers
now in the icinity of. San Francisco
Borja. which is SO miles by trail south
of Cusi.
.May Be Hard to Identify.
IJent'.f.eation of the body at this
time may also prove baffling. Accord
ing to the reports from Mexico City,
Villa has been dead over two weeks
and physical changes may be such as
to preclude any positive proof that the
dead man was Villa. Mexican officials
here said that the Cunited States gov
ernment undoubtedly would accept, the
Identification if made by responsible
Mexican citizens and officials who
knew Villa.
Keporl Lacks Confirmation.
Disappointment was freely ex
pressed here today over the lack of
any official confirmation of the death
of Francisco Villa. Mexican officials
ifre and in Juarez, while still pro
fessing confidence in the truth of the
report, could offer no explanation as
to the silence of Colonel Carlos Car
ranza and the other officers and of
ficials who were reported to have the
tody of the bandit in charge.
A number of newspaper correspond
ents and a few other Americans left
here early today for Chihualma in the
hop" that the story of the finding of
Villa's body was true.

Fort Warren, Boston. The other
American who was aboard was Einar

came from the American consul at
Barcelona, Spain. He said the ship

April 11. Three shots were fired, one
taking effect. The vessel was set

trip, some through skepticism and oth

ed here to have occurred In the Mex

days.
Messages received here in regard to
this rioting stated that there had been
no anti-American outbreak but that
the trouble was due solely to the des
perate condition of the masses of the
people who were facing starvation.
Corn is selling in Chihuahua at two
pesos, worth four cents, American, a

LATE REPORT
LENDS COLOR
TOTHE STORY
Impetus Is Given Tales of
Bandit's Body Being Dug
Out of Grave.
IS EXPECTED SOON
Remains of Outlaw Being
Brought to Border Town
To Be Identified.
Washington, April 17. -Secretary
Baker today received a dis
patch from Jiaco saying that Gen
oral Villa was last seen heading
in the direction of the place
where reports yesterday said he
was buried. The dispatch was
taken by war department officials
to mean that the reports of Villa's
death might be true. The dispatch
was immediately sent to President
Wilson.
A telegraphic dispatch was re
ceived by General Gavira, com
mander of the Jnarez garrison,
from Cnslhnlrlachic at 10:30
o'clock this morning stating that
the body of Francisco Villa had
not arrived there at this hour.
El Paso, Texas, April 17. General
Gavira talked today with the tele
graph operator at San Antonio and ob
tained further details of the reported
finding of Villa's' body.
According to the San Antonio oper
ator, on last Saturday, General Cava
zos and Colonel Carlos Carranza, who
yeje at Cusi, received informatjoul
that a Villa band was operating in the
neighborhood. Two Carranza officers
with a body of men hurriedly left
Cusi and engaged the Villa bandits in
a combat in which many of Villa's fol
lowers were killed and wounded and
some were captured.
A Villa colonel was among the cap
tured. He begged for his life and
promised to lead his captors to the
grave of the bandit if they would not
kill him.
The operator at San Antonio said
that General Cavazos and Colonel
Carranza were taken by the prisoner
to San Francisco Borja, where the
body is reported to have been un
earthed. Pate of Death I'nknown.
The operator gave no further infor
mation to General Gavira except that
Villa was wounded March 7. He did
not know the date of the bandit's
death.
General Gavira said that as soon as
he was advised the body of Villa had
been brought to Cusi he would tele
graph Minister of War Obregon re
questing that the body be brought to
Juarez. General Gavira said Villa
would not be given a military funeral
but he would be buried as a bandit in
the Juarez potters field.
A mining concern here with a repre-
sentative at Santa Barbara received
a message today that that town had
been attacked by bandits Saturday
right. The bandits, whose identity is
unknown, carried off supplies and a
few horses. No casualties were re-
I ported.
I Santa Barbara, a town of about 15,
j OOu is some 15 miles from Parrel.
As the hours pass without confirma
tion of the story of the finding of the
body of Francisco Villa, Washington
grows more doubtful.
Villa's body was to have reached
Chihuahua City by special train some
time last night but American Consul
Letcher has not even forwarded the
rumors as to Villa's death which must
be circulating there.
The Mexican embassy here had no
additional information. Its last report
from Consul Garcia at EI Paso, said
he was seeking confirmation.
State and war department officials
refused to comment today on General
Pershing's report of the Parral fight,
which is much different from the ver
sion transmitted by General Carran
za to support his suggestion that
American troops be withdrawn. The
American report shows that Carranza
troops not only Joined in the attack
upon the little detachment of Amer
icans but followed them several miles
as they withdrew to avoid a clash.
Reply Being Prepared.
The reply to the proposal of Gen
eral Carranza for withdrawal of the
American forces was still in prepara
tion today. It will outline the terms
under which the United States will
discuss the withdrawal of its forces
and until the report of Villa's death
has been confirmed no change in the
program will be made.
A
SISAL TRADE
PUT IN HANDS
PICKED BODY
Sale of Yucatan Crop Will
Be Controlled by Fed
eral Commission.
- v
Washington, April 17. Without dis
cussion, the senate today adopted Sen
ator Ransdcll's resolution directing the
federal trade commission to supervise
distribution of the available sisal In
Yucatan. The commission is ready to
undertake the work. The action is of
much importance to the granger states
which use binder twine.
The commission representing Yuca
tan farmers asked the senate commit
tee to oversee the sale of the crop, but
it does not come within the province
of a legislative body. Chairman Davles
of the federal commission has Informed
Senator Ransdell that It has the ma
chinery to proceed with the distribu
tion and will send two men to Yuca
tan. Senator Ransdell will Introduce
a resolution to put the trade commis
sion in charge.
W. B. Spencer, counsel for the Yuca
tan commission announced that the
plan would be satisfactory to him.
Represenaives of several wine com
panies appeared at the hearing today
to enter their orders for sisal.
Alexander Legge, general manager
of the International Harvester com
pany, introduced a statement denying
that his company had any interest in
twine except to supply it to the farm-
nra at tlio lowest cost, with a reason-
jab,e manufacturors- profit., in order to
increase the advantages and economies
of the company's machinery.
RETRENCH BY USING
REAL LIGHT PAPER
Washington, April 17. The depart
ment of agriculture, in a circular is
sued today, recommends the use of
lighter welit papers to relieve the
present stringency in paper making
materials. Many publishers and many
users of wrapping papers have adopt
ed this plan, it is said.
The weights of printing, writing,
ledger and wrapping papers in many
istances, the department suggests,
can be materially and profitably re
duced. This is especially true of coat
ed papers, for which light, high fin
ished, super-calendered papers can be
substituted with advantages in price,
durability and utility. In a single year
the government's plan effected a total
saving of $38,000.

Region of Verdun.
Paris, April 17. French positions
in Avocourt wood and on the front
from Dead Man's Hill to Cumieres
were bombarded yesterday. There
were no infantry attacks, the official
report of the afternoon says.
To the east of the Meuse the night

tinued artillery activity. There were
no infantry attacks during the day and
night.
"During the night or April 16-17 a
French air squadron composed of nine
machines, during an intense fog, ex
ecuted certain important bombarding
operations in the region of Conflans,
Pagny, Arnaville and Rombach. Pro
jectiles were dropped on the railroad
station at Conflans, the factory at
Rombach, the railroad station at
Arnaville and on the railroad line at
Pagny and Ars.
"During the night of April 15-16, a
French armed aeroplane flying over
the North sea at an altitude of 300 feet
threw 16 shells at a vessel of the
enemy. Eleven of these missiles
found their mark."
MANUFACTURERS ARE
HAMPERING SELVES
New York, April 17. American
manufacturers, particularly manufac
urers of war munitions and supplies,
are hampering the export of their own
goods by luring sailors from the
steamships to the war munition fac
tories, saya Dr. George Sidney Web
ster, secretary of the American Sea
man's Friends society. This has been
accomplished, he says, Siy offering
higher wages than the sailor has been
accustomed to receiving and he has
reason to believe that the shipping
and manufacturing men have been
bidding against each other for the
sailors' services.

IS POSITIVE IN TONE
No Half Measures Used in
Document Despite the
Kaiser's Attitude.
Washington, April 1". Presl
dent Wilson late today completed ;
the communication to Germany on
submarine warfare and sent for
Chairman Stone of the senate for
elgn relations committee for a con
ference probably tonight. This ao ,
tion was in line with the presi
dent's policy of keeping congress
informed of the progress of the ne
gotiations. Washington, April 17. Announce
ment was made at the White house to
day that President W'ilson had prac
tically completed consideration of tha
forthcoming communication to Ger
many and it was indicated that It
probably will go forward to Berlin lata
today or tomorrow.
President Wilson, it was said, haa
been steadily engaged on the note for
two days. He did not go to church,
yesterday but worked practically all
day examining evidence submitted by
the state department.
The document, officials said, will
push the submarine issue to a finish.
It was reiterated that the Sussex casa
would form only a link in the chain ot
evidence the United States will pre
sent to Germany to show that her
promises have not been fulfilled.
The document was characterized by
officials today as being very positive
in tone and they believe that only a,
prompt acquiescence by Germany la
the position taken by the United
States can prevent a break in diplo
matic relations.
Unofficial dispatches from Berlin In
dicating that the German government
is ready to meet the United States
more than half way, it was said, will
not change the course of the American,
government decided on at Friday's
cabinet meeting.
Cites Many Cases.
The president and his cabinet have
agreed on the steps to be taken and the
president is now finishing the phrase
ology of the proposed communica
tion. He intends to include in the in
dictment of Germany's submarine
campaign attacks on neutral vessels
not carrying Americans. That will be
done on the broad grounds of human
ity and for the reason that many of
these neutral vessels were going to or
from the United States.
State department officials declared
Ambassador Gerard at Berlin had not
yet submitted a report of conversa
tions he was reported in press dis
patches last week to have had with
officials of the foreign office.
