tion of Mexican reports (hat Francisco
Villa's body bad been exhumed at San
Francisco Borja and was being
brought to ('bihuahua City was still
lacking at the headquarters of the de
facto government at Juarez to-day.
Gabriel Uavira. commander of the
Juarez garrison, awaited information
from official sources that would dispel
any question of doubt over the reports
of the finding of the bandit's body, but
the Mexican telegraph lines are silent
on the subject.
"I still feel reasonably certain that
the messages received Sunday that
Villa's body had been found is cor
rect," said Andres Garcia, Mexican
consul, here to-day. "1 shall make
every effort to have the body brought
lo Juares where Americans who knew
him, may make an identification that
will be satisfactory to the American
) ople."
A dispatch was received by General
Gavira, commander of the Juarez gar
rison, from Cusihulriachic af 10.30
o'clock this morning stating that (he
body of Francisco Villa had not ar
ri\ ed there at that hour.
According lo the San Antonio op
erator. last Saturday General Cavazos
and Colonel Carlos Carranza, who were
at Cusihuiriachie, received information
that a Villa band was operating in tlie
neighborhood. The Carranza offlcers
with a body of men engaged the Villa
bandits in a combat in which manv of
Villa's followers were killed and
wounded and some were captured.

Mexico City stating that Minister of

The current was deadly swift; the
light of a late Saturday afternoon was
waning. Roth boatmen, struggling
in the water screamed for help.
Looker swam for the overturned canoe
and clung desperately to the craft
until help came. Guinlvan, as he
passed over the bidden cable, grabbed
despairingly for the stout wire, caught
it—and held on. "
Fred W. Dinger and Edward Hooker
who heard the cries hurried to the
rescue and after a stiff battle in the
racing stream opposite "Hardscrabble"
the youths were brought in. Guinivan

Italians (Jain Slight Territory
After Hard Fighting
With Austrians
After temporarily assuming the ag
gressive in the Verdun battle, launch
ing attacks in the Douaumont-Vaux
region which are declared to have
gained them some ground, the French
yesterday and last night held their
Infantry in check. Neither was there
any move by the German infantry arm,
according to this afternoon's Paris
bulletin.
Apparently a new movement of
some importance is preparing west of
the Meuse. , Heavy bombardment of
the French positions in the Avocourt
region and along the line for some
distance northeast, including the Dead
Alan's Hill sector, has been mentioned
iti several recent official statements
by the French war office and similar
artillery activity is again recorded to
day.
Although Rome lia3 reported heavy
fighting on the Austro-Italian front, |
with success for (he Kalians, (he cur- j
rent headquarters statement, from ;
Vienna mentions only small engage- j
ments and records no changes of ter
ritory in consequence.
Riotous demonstrations occurred in
Athens when an attempt was made to
break up a meeting of adherents of i
former Premier Venizelos, supporter
of the entente cause. One report says I
several shots were fired and that a i
number of the former premier's fol
lowers were arrested.
French airmen are showing great
activity in bombarding positions back j
of the German lines, attacking rail- '
road stations and factories.
The French war office also reports
lhal "a vessel of Ihe enemy" was
struck in the North Sea by bombs
dropped from a French armed aero- I
plane.
There have been two recent, raids
by French airmen north of Salonikl, !
Rulgarian forces at Strumitsa station
being bombarded by one squadron and
German positions at Bogantz by an
other.
On the eastern front (here are ap
parently no notable operations in
progress.

altack was made on German positions
at Bogdantze. Both squadrons re

Bibles to Cost More;
Paper Advance Is Cause
N'ew York, April 17. —Alarm ob
lains among publishers of religious
i books and periodicals over the ad
vances in prices of paper, ink, leather
and glue. Purchasing Agent Jennings,
of the Methodist Book Concern, says
its bills for white paper alone will ad
vance this year by $130,000. and that
ink, leather and glue will increase
the sum to $150,000. An immediate
effect Is the decrease in the grants of
: pensions (o aged ministers, who rc
j eeive profits from the concern's busi
] ness.
The American Bible Society has just
issued a statement explaining to
j handlers of Bibles its inability to fill
i orders promptly, owing (o advances in
J prices and hindrances in railroad ship
ments. It is slated that the 2-cent
| Testaments will cost twice as much as
formerly.

Twice as Many Bachelors
as Married Men Go Wrong;
Criminals More Economical
By Associated Press
New York, April 17. Unmarried
' men as law breakers outnumber mar
ried men two to one in the annual re- 1
| port of the district attorney of New j
j York county. This relative propor- j
tion was maintained last year, when j
2.484 single men as compared to 1,-i
j 244 married men were arraigned in j
itlie criminal courts. The proportion I
I of men arraigned as criminals in thei
j list ten years is even more to the dis- 1
advantage of the bachelors 22,321 of
them were accused while only 0.4H2,
married men were charged with [
crimes.
More crime was committed by per-1
Jsons between the ages of 21 and 30
I than by those of any other age. Few
i men past 70 were convicted. The rec- I
lord shows that criminals are becoming;
more economical and are increasing|
their demands for free counsel to be I
| assigned by the courts. Except in
i murder cases, the lawyers so assigned '
I receive no pay.

"Motorzine" at 4 cents
Gallon, Latest Motor Fuel
St. l,ouis. Mo.. April 17.—"Motor
| zine," a substance invented by AV. K.
i Stevens, a St. I.ouisan, to supply a
J cheaper and belter substitute for gaso
j line as a motor fuel, was characterized
by the superintendent of the Ford [
Automobile Company in St. Louis to
day as one of the greatest discoveries
of recent years and one which will
revolutionize th? automobile industry.
The results have been demonstrated to '
Henry Ford in Detroit.
The average mileage of the new fuel
is said to be twenty-seven per gallon.
When mixed with crude oil or coal oil,
the new fuel clarifies it at once, and j
the heavier oil does not carbonize the [
machinery. Instead it cleans the en
gine.
The inventor claims it will bo pos- ;
sible to manufacture it for about
4 cents a gallon in million-gallon lots.
