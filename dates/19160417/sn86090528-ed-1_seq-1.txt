HELD FOR
GRAND JURY
Frank Jones, John lioyles and Peek
Couch of Wilson, Carter county, were
arraigned before Judge Kugcne Ham
ilton, United States commissioner for
this Oklahoma district, .Saturday, up
on charges of Introducing intoxicating
liquors into the old Indian Territory.
At the examination of the defend
ants, who were represented by Attor
new Castleman, of Wilson, Doyles and
Couch were discharged from custody
and Jones held to answer to the fed
eral grand jury. Ernest Lemsford, a
witness and a friend of tho defend
ants, also of "Wilson, was so enthusias
tic in the matter of giv.'ng testimony
calculated to secure their release
from custody that he succeeded in
placing himself behind the jail's doors
as a suspected party to the liquor in
troduction. Later in the day, how
ever, following a complete investiga
tion of hir- character. Judge Hamilton
ordered the release of Lemsford.
Sheriff Jim Biffle of Jefferson coun
ty, and United States Marshal Dic,k
Worley appeared as witnesses for the
government In the matter.
Defendant Couch, at the time of his
arrest by Sheriff Biffle, managed to
dispose of any incriminating evidence
which he may have had In his posses
sion. He was In an auto which he was
driving himself, when arrested, and
watching an opportunity, before his
car could be searched, steamed up and
drove away. Sheriff Biffle states, at
breakneck speed. The sheriff chased
him across the landscape of Jefferson
county for over ten miles before com
ing up with him a second time. A
search at that time disclosed no
"booze" in Couch's car. Search of
Jones' car is said to have brought to
light 18 cases of whiskey and 8 barrels
of beer.
At the examining trial Saturday a
witness for the defense stated that the
whiskey was in "sample bottles." La
ter he stated the size of each "sam
ple" bottle was of the quart variety.
Deputy Marshall Worley took Jones,
to the federal jail at Muskogee Satur- f
day night.

Men are being invited to return to
their homes on condition that they
cultivate the land in the Austro-Ger-mans'
interests. Russian prisoners
are even being loaned to help wmi
farm work.
Mills are being refitted with mod
ern machinery, expert engineers have
assumed management of the mines
and every effort is being made to find
workers in both from the native popu
lation. A similar policy is being adopted in
Montenegro. At the same time these
industrial and agricultural , improve
ments are in progress, both countries
are bein lamed practically into huge

School also are being opened. In
Belgrade two are running, with a total
attendance of about P..O00. Instruction

PHEASANTS PEST TO
PORTLAND GARDENERS
By United Press.
Portland, Ore., April 17.
Thousands of gorgeously plum
ed Chinese pheasants infesting
tho highways and byways of
this city today arc making life
a burden for Portland house
wives and property owners.
Apparently they belong to no
one in particular. Game laws
and anti-firearm city ordinanc
es prevent their slaughter. So
the birds continue to rip out
spring gardens. Mayor Albee
has refused S. J. Claridgo and
other citizens permission to
shoot the pheasants, but has in
structed the police force mem
bers to ."shoo" tho critters
away as much as possible.
BRYANT FOR
2ND TERM
While candidates for county com
missioner in the central district are
as plentiful as peaches were last year
and in the southern district two men
have entered the race, in the northern
district there has been nothing like a
grand rush to get into the game. Be
ing unwilling to see the office go beg
ging, W. A. Bryant, of Pocasset, the
present incumbent, has decided to be
a.cand'dc'.to for re-election and the for
mal announcement of his candidacy,
subject to the approval of Democrat
ic voters, is made today.
During the time he has served as
commissioner, Mr. Bryant has been
active at all times in the performance
of his official duties, attending all
board meetings and earnestly endeav
oring to serve the best interests of
the taxpayers of the county at every
stage of the game.
"I assume that the citizens of Grady
county have been watching the work
of the commissioners and have been
keeping tab 011 what we have been
doing," said Mr. Bryant, "and hence
it is out of order for me to make prom
ises. The people can judge from my
record better than from anything I
might say and all that I ask is that
my record be fairly examined. If the
voters want me to serve them again,
I shall be glad to do so and shall ap
preciate their support."
RELEASED ON BOND.
Roy Thompson, colored, was this
morning released from the county jail
in bonds in the sum of $."00 to answer
to the county court May 1, on charge.,
of transporting intoxicating liquors.
Thompson was one of three negroes

Washington, D. C, April 17.-Direw
tor. Sam L. Rogers, of the Bureau ofi
the Census, Department of Commerce,
is soon to issue a unique set of tables,
the first of their kind which have ever;
been prepared by the United States
government. These tahlea -a-hinH
were compiled in the division of vital
statistics, under the suDervision f
Professor James W. Glover, of tha
University of Michigan, show death
rates and expectation of life at all
ages for the population of the six New,
England states, New York, New Jer
sey, Indiana, Michigan and the Dis
trict of Columbia (the original death
registration states) on the basis ol the,
population in 1910 and the mortality,
for the three years 1909, 1910 and
11. They are similar to the "life ta-t
bles" prepared by life insurance com
panies, but differ trom them In that
they relate to the entire population ot
the area covered, whereas the life in
surance tables relate only to risks se
lected through medical examination!
and otherwise. ,
Expectation of life, at birti, In k rim:
tionary population that is, one In
which the births and deaths wera
equal and were the same from year taj
year, and in which there was no immi
gration or emigration would be tha
same as average age at death, which
is calculated by totalizing the ages ot
all deceased persons and dividing tha
esult by the number of deceased per
sons. 1
According to these tables the aver
age expectation of Iffe, at birth, fori
males is 4.9 years; lor females, E3.3
years; for white males, 53.6 years;!
for native white males, 50.6 years; foil
native white females, 54.2 years; for
negro males. 37.7 years. Females are
thus longer lived than males to the
extent of more than 3 years, and in
the case of the native whites and ne
groes, more than 3Vi years.
The expectation ot life at the age o?
1 is considerably greater than at birth,
being 56.8 years for native white
males and 59.5 for native white fe
males, and reaches its maximum at
the age of 2, when it is 57.3 for the
farmer class and 60.1 for the latter.
At the ago of 12 the average native
white male's expectation of life is
50.2 years; at 2,5 it is 39.4 years; at
40, 28.3 years; at 50, 21.2 years; at 60,
1 1.6 years; at 70, 9.1 years; and at 89
5.2 years. Similarly, at the age ol 13
the average native white female's ex
pectation ot life is 52.6 years; at 25
It is 41.8 years; at 40, 30.3 years at 60,
22.8 years; at 60, 15.8 years; a$ 30j
9.8 years; and at 80, 5.5.
A part of the difference between
expectation of life for men and for
women is due to the greater number
of violent deaths among men. Nearly
four-fifths of these violent deaths
suicides, homicides and accidental
deaths are of males, and such deaths
form about 7 or 8 per cent of the to
tal number occurring each year. This
fact, however, does not account fully,
or even in major part, for the greater,
longevity of women. An examination
of the tables discloses a lower death
rate fur females than for males dur
ing each of the first 12 months ot life
and, in the case of the native whites,
during each year of 'iff up to the age
ot 94. During the first month of Ufa
the death rate among native whites is
nearly 28 per cent higher for boys
than for girls, and during the first
year it is more than ?o per cent high
er. Infant Mortality Still Higher.
