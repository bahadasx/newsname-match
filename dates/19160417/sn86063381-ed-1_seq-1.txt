Scoop Joins A Punitive Expedition
PRICE OF DRUGS
HIGHEST SINCE
THE CIVIL WAR
State Pharmaceutical Association Pre
pares Interesting
Statement.
PRICE OF MET0L HAS
INCREASED 3,000 PER CENT
Many Chemicals Are Unobtainable
Many Reasons for State
of Affairs.
The present high price of drugs and
chemicals has never been equaled
even in the times of our own Civil
War, according to Eduard F. Netzer,
of Bemidji, chairman of the Beltrami
county publicity committee of the
State Pharmaceutical association.
A statement received today from
the state association by Mr. Netzer is
as follows:
Show Big Increases.
The following list shows some oi
the remarkable jumps in price, com
paring the prices of July, 1914, at the
outbreak ot the European war, with
the high point reached since then:
Belladonna, increased 700 per cent
Lanolin, 500 Potassium bromide,
1,500 Quinine, 1,200 Sage, 500 Sa
lol, 800 Antyprin, 1,000 Metol, 3,-
000, Carbolic acid, 1,000 Naphtha
lene, 500 Phenacetin, 1,800 Potas
sium permanganate, 700 Saccharin,
600 Salicylic acid, 900 Thymol,
600 Hydrochinone, 2,000.
Experts now say if the war con
tinues for another year many drugs
and chemicals will be absolutely un
obtainable by that time and their
places will have to be filled by others
possessing identical or similar prop
erties. A few drugs are unobtain
able now.
Reasons for Increases,
There are many underlying reasons
for this state of affairs. All of the
vegetable and animals oils have risen
enormously because of the fact that
glycerin can be made from them
and the glycerin then converted into
the explosive nitro-glycerin or dyna
mite. This is true especially of cod
liver oil, which is being taken by
Germany from Norwegian sources of
supply. Castor oil comes from a seed
principally grown in India, and Great
Britain, who controls the trade, has
placed an embargo upon the oil, it is
said, because it is one of the few
oils suitable for lubricating aero
planes.
War is Blamed.
The compounds of mercury, among
which are calomel, corrosive subli
mate, gray powder, blue mass, blue
ointment, etc., are scarce because
mercury is used in making the com
pounds known as fulminates, indis
pensable for the caps used for ex
ploding cartridges and shells.
Quinine still maintains its ab
normally high price on account of the
high figures obtained at the recent
auction sale of cinchona bark, from
which quinine is made, held at Ams
terdam, the world's center for this
drug.
Glycerin is enormously high also
on account of its use in the manu
facture of nitro-glycerin.
Paris Green High.
Paris Green and other insecticides
are high in price on aecount of the
scarcity of the crude products from
which they are made. Licorice root
and stick licorice have risen to un
heard of figures and are still going
up, as the Spanish and Italian sources
of supply are exhausted and the Rus
sian supply is not available because
of the closing of the Dardanelles.
Every time a pharmacist refills an
old prescription at its original price,
the chances are he is losing money.
There is no class of substances in
which the rise in price has been so
little felt by the consumer and large
ly equalized by the taking of smaller
profits, as in the case of drugs.
STOCKHOLDERS OF NEW
SUMMER HOTEL TO MEET
The stockholders of the Birchmont
Beach hotel will meet tonight at the
Commercial club rooms to consider
plans for the coming season. The
date of the opening of the hotel and
improvements will probably be de
cided.
George Cochran, Sr., is planning on
having constructed, adjoining the ho
tel, a $5,000 dining hall, kitchen and
place for hired help. He also plans
to construct several more cottages.
Prospects for the summer hotel
business for the coming season are
excellent.
IMPORTANT SESSION
OF COUNCIL TONIGHT
The Bemidji city council will hold
an important meeting at the city hall
tonight.
Reports will be made on the new
Mississippi river inlet bridge and the
Nymore street via lake shore.
Estimates as to the cost of extend
ing the water main from Irvine av
enue to Greenwood cemetery will be
submitted and the finance committee
will report the amount of funds avail
able for improvements this year.
Street paving and sanitary sewer
work will probably be decided on.
LUMBER SCALING
SHOWS INCREASE
As a result of the investigations of
the scaling of lumber, timber cut on
qtate land has suddenly increased 50
per. cent in scalers' sheets, according
to Oscar Arneson, clerk in the office
of the state auditor.
Mr. Arneson made his report to
State Auditor Preus yesterday. In his
report he states that he has laid evi
dence of five trespass cases in this dis
trict before County Attorney Graham
Torrance. Confessions, according
to the report, was received from two
men.
MANY ENTRIES RECEIVED
FOR BREAD MAKING CONTEST
Many samples and entries have been
received for the bread baking con
test which is being held in conjunc
tion with the domestic science de
partment of the Bemidji schools. The
contest will close at the end of the
present school year in June. Miss
Elizabeth Vermilye, instructor in the
domestic science department, is in
charge of the contest.

ual training department of the Be
midji schools, today announced that
an exhibit of the articles made by
the students in the manual training
department will be placed in a down
town display window soon. Just
where the exhibit will be, has not

OFFICIALS GENERALLY
DISCREDIT THE RUMOR
Parral Attack Report is Made Public
Details Are Still
Lacking.
El Paso, April 17.Unconfirmed
rumors from Carranza sources are
that Villa is dead. A body dug up
from a two weeks' old grave by Car
los Carranza, a nephew of General
Carranza, is being taken to Chihua
hua City. American officials dis
credit the rumor.
Identification Difficult.
El Paso, April 17.Carranza Con
sul Garcia stated late this afternoon
that neither he nor General Cavira
had any official confirmation of the
recovery or identification of Villa's
bodv He stated that in any event
the identification would be difficult
on account of the length of time the
bodv is reported to have been buried.
President Thrilled.
Washington, April 17.The ad
ministration is straining every re
source to confirm or disapprove the
report that Villa is dead. All the
officers from the president down are
thrilled.
Pershing Investigates.
San Antonio, April 17.(Official)
General Pershing has left Cusihur
lshoc with cavalry detachments to
view the body which is being brought
to Chihuahua City and which is
claimed to be that of Villa. Knowing
Villa personally, Pershing should he
able to positively state within a f$Wu
hours whether the body is thafe?$'
Villa unless the body is mutilated..
Orders Army On.
San Antonio, April 17.Lacking
advices as to the death of Villa, Gen
eral Funston has ordered that the
American troops push on near Parral
where Villa was last reported.
Citizens to Mexico.
El Paso, April 17.Villa may be
dead as reported by the American
army officials but are anxious that
the leader's body may be identified.
A small train left Guerez this morn
ing with a small group of Americans,
including a number knowing Villa in
timately, going to Chihuahua City to
meet the body.
Good Food Supply.
Columbus, April 17.The quarter
master's corps today reported that
there was enough food and supplies
in the field to carry the army to May
15 if no more was shipped.
Pershing Reports.
San Antonio, April 17.Two un
armed troopers of the Tenth United
States cavalry were shot down in the
streets of Parral when Mexicans,
without provocation, fired upon a de
fenseless foraging party entering the
town in seach of supplies, General
Pershing reported to General Fred
erick Funston here Saturday night.
Pursued by the mob, the survivors
of the foraging squad fled to the camp
of the main body with the account
of the assault, according to the de
tails of the fight made public by Gen
eral Funston.
More than 40 Mexicans were killed
when a detachment of the Tenth,
advancing toward Parral to recover
the bodies of the murdered soldiers,
clashed with the mob.
More than 100 rioters fell wound
ed under the sharp fire of the Amer
ican troops, it is reported. Seven
cavalrymen are said to have been
struck, but no fatalities were an
ounced.
General Pershing's dispatch did not
state whether members of the Car
ranzista garrison were in the mob.
Two Are Killed.
The cavalrymen recovered the bod
ies of their dead and withdrew, ad
vices say.
Two reports were received from
Pershing, General Funston stated,
one coming by way of Columbus and
he other by way of Chihuahua, where
it was relayed by Consul Letcher.
Chagrined by the meagerness of
the report, after four days of anxious
waiting, the major general declared
sharply he had rushed forward a de
mand that Pershing furnish further
details. He expressed great relief,
however, to learn that first reports
of many cavalrymen being killed
were exaggerated.
Pershing's advices nearly had been
anticipated by official and unofficial
dispatches from other sources. These'
were considered sufficient by General
Funston and the commander imme
diately wired Pershing demanding a'
more detailed account.
