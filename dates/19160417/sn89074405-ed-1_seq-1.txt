"Carransa government officials are not able to give any information
regarding the unofficial dispatch from Mexico City stating that Minis

here Chat there waa some emr in the cable, and telegraphic transmis

Omml Garda's information is that the body of Villa has been ex

whence It is to be sent on special train to Chihuahua city.
Official word from Washington that tbe United States troops would
to Immediately withdrawn from Mexico if Villa is dead will undoubt
edly result in expediting the efforts of the ownuua government to
ssctilnln the truth of the reports of the locating of Villa's body, and
to make a full and satisfying identification, it is supposed the body of
the bandlt stUl is Interred at San Francisco Borja, as stated in the
latest Mexico City advices, and it is likely to be many days before tbe
Identification can be made unless the Mexican government accepts aa

Saa Antonio, April 17.—Unless the body reported to be of

not crane to the attention of military officials, it was annoonced at
General Fonston's headquarter*. Ftmston Is without oAdal knowledge
of the question of Villa's death. It must be established beyond any

HI HISTORY,
london, April l7.-:-Th» most
gijgantio conflict in the history of the
world, the battle of Vei'dUn, has en
tered upon its ninth week. It is in
many respects without precedent. The
enormous scale of the Gernian prep
arations and execution of tUe sttack,
the unparalleled concentration of
artillery and the sustained ferocity of
fighting mark the battle as one of the
greatest efforts of tbe jrar.'
Verdun has been ratpd as one of
the strongest fortresses of Europe, the
corner stone of the French defenses
against Germany. The evolution of
military tactics during the war, how
ever, and particularly the employment
-by the Germans of long rings howitz
ers oapable of reducing the' gireatest
forts have done much to change the
character of the *Verdun campaign as
compared with the earlier conceptions
of what such a struggle might be.
Before the battle opened, the French
partly dlsmantlsd thetr forts around
Verdun and .hei4,:fw elsewhere en the
various fronts, chief relianes tor. re
sistance..!n*s placed on an elaborate

State and war department officials
refused to comment on Pershing's
report of the Parral fight, which is
much different, from the one trans

withdrawn. The American rppoi^,
shows that the Carranza troops not
only joined In the attack upon the
little detachment of Americans, but

E. F. Ladd Declares Farm­......
ers Lose 15 Cents on Bush
el of Rejected Wheat
(HeraBM Special Service.)
Fargo, N. IX. April 17.—F&rmers
selling rejected grain at 21 cents less
than the pric»' commanded by No. 1
wheat, are loising 15 cent3 on every
bushel. Such .statement was made
today by Dr. B, F. Ladd, president of
the North Dakota agricultural col
lege In a heading before the state
railroad commission, where the ques
tion of grain grading was consid
ered.
Dr. Ladd pointing to millings tests
conducted at the North Dakota agri
cultural college, said the present
spread of 21 cents In No. 1 and re
jected wheats is entirely 'unfair, un
just and Tinneecssary."
North Dakota's tests. Dr. Ladd said,
revealed the actual difference In mill
ing value of only 6 cents per bushel,
as between high grade and low grade
wheats, the low grade wheat having
much more- gluten. Dr. Ladd also
maintained, that small millers were
being driven out) of business through
the fact that they are unable to util
ise the lower grades of wheat. This
gives big millers, using low grade
wheat, a big leverage, with which they
are able to iuccessfully force the
small millers out of business, he said.
The railroad, commission will seek
to And a way of bringing about a
change in grain grading in this state.
The grain. grades now conform to
Minnesota's regulations.
