WAGONS IN CLEAN-UP
I louseholders Urged to Have
Their Rubbish Ready in
Sacks or Boxes.
NORTH SIDE IS FIRST
Work Will Cover the Whole
Town and Be Done As
(Juickly as Possible.
"Don't wait until Thursday to get
the rubbish to the front or jour
house," sajs .Airs. Jesse H. Wrench,
chairman of the Clean-Up Committee,
of the Civic League, to the Columbia
citizens who think there is plenty of
time in which to get their part of
Columbia's housecleaning done. "It
will be too late by that time, for we
hope to get all the work done before
Thursday. There has been some mis
understanding regarding the date, but
Clean-Up AVcek officially begins to
daj."
The citj authorities say that refuse
must be on the street. Teams posi
tively will not go into alleys for rub
bish, nor will they collect ashes
Nothing else, however, is excluded by
the ban.
A Warning as to Hums.
The Civic League also wishes to
give a warning regarding barns.
'"Many Columbia barns," Mrs. Wrench
says, "are in bad shape. This is the
time of year when it is comparative
ly easy to prevent germ spreading
Clean the barn now, and save your
self and your neighbor the possibility
or disease and the certain discomrort
or riies."
One or the methods prescribed by
the league for those who wish to keep
their barns in a sanitary condition is
to clean the barn and apply chlorido
of lime.
"Another method which will not les
sen the value of the compost of gar
dening is the application of 10 cents'
wortli of horax every ten days," said
.Airs Wrench. "This will stop the
breeding of flies "
Any who want infoimation as to
the week or have complaints to
make are asked to call C. O. Hanes,
secretary of the Commercial Club,
Phone Xo. 1099.
To Itejfiu Hiwliiifr Tomorrow.
A survey was made yesterday of
Columbia, according tp J. Paul Price,
city- engineer and there was not suf
ficient trash out to justify collection.
The wagons will not begin hauling un
til tomorrow morning. Mr. Price ex
pects to have twelve wagons at work
at 7 o'clock. He will begin in the
northeast corner of Columbia and work
south and west over the whole town.
There will be four to six teams to a
division and one man to each two
teams of the division. All of Colum
bia north of Itroadway and east or
Kighth street will be covered tomor
row, and it the people co-operate, prob
ably the rest of town the second day.
It will be impossible for the wagons
to go into the backyards of alleys this
year according to Mr. Price. So the
people are urged to have all their
rubbish in sacks or boxes In the front.
The sack or box holding the trash
will not be taken if marked. Last
year the men lost time by having to
go back for trash that persons neg
lected to have out on time. This year
it is hoped every one will be ready
ror the clean-up wagons.

THICK OF PKOGKKSS IS IIICII"
Dr. A. . Tnjlor TliiiiLs Church Is
lleconiin- Solidly I'nitcil.
That the church is passing through
a transition period and is becoming
more solidly united was the thought
developed by Dr. A. W. Taylor ot the
Missouri Bible College in his lecture
in the Y. M. C A. Auditorium jester
day morning on "Where the Church
Falls Short."
Doctor Taj lor drew analogies be
tween the church, school and govern
ment. "Wo all realize there are
deficinecies in our democratic torm
or government, and manj' are zealous
to point out ponderous imperfections
in our school system," said Doctor
Taylor, "but still we would not think
or doing without these institutions a)
they iiiow exist in our present state or
civilization.
"When institutions, as well as indi
viduals, learn that sacrifice is the
price of progress, the church and all
other conservative organizations will
serve humanity in a larger measure
than at the present time."

SAX AXTOXIO, Tex., April 17.
General Pershing is en route this ar
ternocxn with a cavalry detachment
to Chihuahua to identify, if possible,
the body being brought there, which
is said to be that of the outlaw Fran
cisco Villa.
A physician who treated Villa for
several months recently is also being
sought to aid in the identification or
the body.
General Frederick Funston places
some credence in the reports that 'il
la is dead. However, no move has
been made to change the locations or
the American troops or to withdraw
them.
Americans Withhold Judgment.
KL PASO. Tex.. April 17. Vilja
may be dead as reported, but army oN
ficers here this afternoon are inclined
to wait ror an identification or the
body by Americans.
Many Americans who know Villa
intimately are now en route to view
the body when it readies Chihuahua.
They have inarched with him against
Huerta and will not be easily- deceiv
ed.
It is thought here that the Mexi
cans would get any body ayd have it
hurriedly identified as that or A'ilki
and buried in order to secure the
withdrawal ot the American troops
from their territory.
