THE VOTERS
The inevitable llth hour election dodge has been
sprung, just as it always is sprung by .some desper
ate candidate hoping to turn the tide in his favor.
In this case again it takes the despicable form of
playing on religious prejudices.
Cards exactly duplicating the election cards of
Woods, Btoever and .Meads, except that on the pic
tured facet of the respective candidates they carry
a black cross, arc being distributed.
The inference thai is .sought to ho left is that they
are an attack on Woods, Ntoevei' and Meads, because
of supposed church affiliations.
However, nohody todny could he found who would
even charge that their issuance was the work of
these men's opponents. As a matter of fact nobody
in the Pettit, (Jronen or Shoemaker camps was in
any way .responsible for them, and nobody would
have been more delighted to bring the guilty persons
to punishment than would the men hacking those
three candidates.
There is much evidence, however, to show that the
cards were issued by friends of Woods, Stoever and
Meads, in a frantic hope of swinging public sym
pathy in their direction. The Times is glad to he
a hie to say that, so far as we have heen able to learn,
Messrs. Woods, Stoever and Meads personally knew
nothing of the plan. Supporters of that trio are
known to be circulating the cards and to have pos
session of large quantities of them.
It is a cheap, nasty political trick, and it is going
to do nohody any good.
We believe the average voter tomorrow is going to
disregard this and every other effort to turn atten
tion from the main issues.
We believe the average voters is going to decide in
favor of Pettit, Gronen and Shoemaker—and do it
simply and solely because those three men are the
ablest, the best-trained, the most efficient and the
cleanest in the race.
Wilson to Use Big Stick On
Senate In Behalf of Brandeis
By Gilson Gardner.
WASHINGTON, D. C„ April 17.|
-—President Wilson has not put
forth the influence of his office
to secure the confirmation of
Louis D. Brandeiß as a justice of
the V. S. supreme court. ,
The matter has been permitted
to take Its course in the senate,
but it is presumed that rather
than see the nomination fail the
president will do what he can to
bring il. niocidiie members Into
line.
As a party matter it would
■ot look well jnst before elec
tion for a senate with a strong
democratic majority to lie on
recoyd aa refusing the con
firmation of a Jew.
When the Jew also Is a
brilliant radical, It would
tend in addition to stamp the
party as Uourlstn and reac
tionary.
The nomination of Brandeis
Aas done more than anything else

SOI ON IIIX lOA TACOMA, WASH., MONDAY, APRIL 17, I<M<>. lc A COPY
in the history of this adminis
tration to arouse enthusiasm
among forward-looking voters,
regardless of party.
Muny progressives who had
turned to the president in the be
ginning of his administration, but
were disappointed with his atti
tude toward the progressive party
group in congress, have accepted
the Brandeis appointment ss evi
dence of the president's funda
mental progresslveness.
The senate will divide not on
party lines entirely, but on lines
of progresslvism and the contrary.
The special privilege members
and those who by long years of
habit think only ln terms of ben
efit to big business, see In the
Brandeis nomination a menace to
the integrity of the supreme court,
whereas members in both parties
who think of economic problems
ln contemporaneous terms and
believe in bringing laws up to
date and administering them in

Sam Wall announced- today
thusiastically In favor of putting
men like Brandeis on the su

The prospect of a favora
ble report from this commit-. .
tee Is not. a good one. About
nil the friends of Brandeis
mny hope for Is a report of
nny sort that will place the
name of Brandeis before the
senate to Ims voted on by tbe
full membership, and even
then the lineup of the senate
Is somewhat doubtful.
Much will depend on tbe
reaction of public sentiment.
The senate is quite respon
sive nowadays to public
opinion.
