tic conflict In the history of the
world, the battle of Verdun, has en
dured for the ninth week without any
sinns of either Bide withdrawing or
showing any evidence of rellnqulsh

Tin in commercial quantities has

WINNIPEG, Can., Apr. 17. A move
ment is under way among liquor deal
ers In Manitoba, which voted out its
saloons at an election last month, to
petition the government for two
months of grace in order to dispose of
stock on hand. Should the petition
meet with favor, the province will go
"dry" until August 1.
"We have been with you for two
score years, and another 80 days will
matter little," is the plea of the liquor
dealers.
On the other hand .the prohibition
leaders botly protest against any ex
tension of time. They point to the fact
that more than three fourths of Can
adian territory already has voted out
saloons and confidently predict that
before the new year Quebec alone I
among the provinces will retain the
liquor licensing system and that even
here licensing will be restricted to
Montreal, Quebec and a number of
large urban centers.

VIENNA, Apr. 17 Caps are fast re
placing hats in Vienna. As Is known
to all observing travelers, Vienna,
alone among the Vreat cities of Eu
rope, has hitherto been conspicuous
from the fact ythat all its men and
boys Insisted on wearing hats, dis
daining the cheap and comfortable
cap that is popular among among the
working classes In London, Berlin and
Paris. Austria has always possessed
a large hat industry and hats were
almot as cheap as caps here, but the
war has caused a shortage of wool
and the cheap felt hats have doubled
In price. The result is an increasing
number of converts to the cap.
GERMAN KNITTED GOODS
BARRED FROM ENGLAND
BOOSTS STOCK
OVER FIVE FEET OF COMMER
CIAL ORE CUT IN THE
OLD MINE
One of the most Important of the
series of splendid developments that
have recently taken place In Tonopah
is the discovery of a vein in the south
crosscut on the 800 level six hundred
feet from the new shaft of the Midway
Consolidated Mining company. This it
the second vein that has been cut In
this working. The former was not "
large, but carried shipping values.
The new Btrike was made Saturday
night.- By this morning the crosscut
bad advanced five and a half feet and
the face was still in ore of about $20
grade, with the drill crunching through
the quartz.
It Is not yet known whether or not
the ledge is one of those hitherto
found in other properties. It may be
entirely a new find. The quartz is
nearly pure white and the sulphides
shine in pleasing contrast. There is
no water to impede operations and the
two Bhifts will continue operations
rapidly.
While the crosscut Is being forged
ahead a drift will be run on the ore
and later a second will be sent out.
The vein appears to be exactly east
and west end If such proves to be the
case the company will have the ledge
for a long distance, up in the thou
sands of feet. The vein is dipping to
ward the shaft and already a heading
is being put out on the 1100 level,
where It is probable that the vein will
be cut about 400 feet from the shaft.
H. C. Brougher, president or the
Midway, when asked for a statement
this morning said: "I don't care to
say anything about assays at this
time. We have had so many disap
pointment about the Midway that I
prefer to wait until after we prove be
yond a doubt that we have opened a
body of commercial ore."
