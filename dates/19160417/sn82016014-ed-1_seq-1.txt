San Antomo, April 17. General
per: hing left Culhulruichlc with a
rnvilry detachment to view the body
being bruunht to Chihuahua Claimed
to be that of Villa, it was announced
al hsadQunrtera today. iVraWne will
be abb to give positive advices In a
few hours a lo whrther the body is
that of the fugitive bandit leader, un
less the corpse is in such a condition
as t prevent identification.
General Funston today wired army
offi.-rs r.t Duugias. Ariz., to look up
a Dr. Wiikman. wh'. treated Villa for
ni.nlhs last fall and have him vier
the body. To make the identification
more certain, I'll aim also sent out
q aeries s. -eking other men who have
knvn Villa more or iess intimately
durftn his r cent career. This course
on the part of the major general, de
spite the fact that no official confirm
ation has come to him of Villa'.-? body
having been found, indicated Kunston
was placing considerable taith in the
reports from Mexico. He declared he
had no information on which to base
surmise that the body is Villa's. But
Fanaton laid emphasis on the fact that
t be point where the body was ex
humed La near the region where Col
onel Howae reported Villa's latest op
erations -the La Borja region. Howze
knew beyond question that Villa was
in that section, it was stated at head
quart rs. but the time was not made
clear.
Held Doctor Captive.
Dr. TT It If man treated Villa for a
blood disease and was held captive for
two months in order to insure Villa
medical attendance. He escaped from
Villa's army when the forces reached
a point near Douglas and army offi
cials lost track of him.
No further information regarding
the fighting and rioting at Parral had
reached headquarters today. The
only reports received stated that por
tions of the Tenth. Eleventh and Thir
teenth cavalry were now stationed at
Santa Cruz, prepared to defend the
position or take up the pursuit again.

Kl Paso, April 17. Carranza Consul
Garcia stated today that neither he
nor General Gavlra in Juarez had anj
official confirmation of the recovery
or identification of V ilia's body. la
any event, Garcia stated, the identifi
cation would be difficult on account of
the length of time the reported Villa
was buried and owing to the character
of the disease from which he Is re

"I could not tie fooled about it . '
said General Funston. "I would know
the body of Villa, however mutilated
It might tic hy the teeth and the hair
and no other body could he passed off

San Antonio, April 17. I'nless the
body reported to be that of Francisco
Villa is brought to Kl Paso, the matter
of identification probably will not
come to the attention of the military
officials, it was announced at Gen
eral Kit nst irn's headquarters today.
leneral Funston Is without official
knowledge on the question of Villa's
death. It must be established beyond
any doubt the bandit leader is dead
before military authorities will relax
the campaign they have been pushing
against him, for the last month.

yesterday that Colonel Brown had
asked Consul Letcher at Chihuahua to

duce a body said to be Villa's, make
a hurried identification and then bury
it as a means causing the withdrawal
of the American forces from Mexico.

BANDITS KILL 4

.Murdered by Mexicans.
Refugees at San Diego Tell of
Bloody Massacre.
San Diego, Cal., April 17. Bringing
' a thrilling story of the massacre of
three Americans and a Spaniard on
April 4 by bandits near Kosario, Mex-
ico, 68 American and British refugees
I from Mazatlan and Palme tu Del Ver
de Islands arrived here Sunday from
: Mexico on the naval supply steamer
Glacier.
The pleadings of three children
saved the lives of V- H. York and his
wife when the bandits refused to obey
their leader who ordered the entire
party massacred. The victims of the
band were Walter Wallape. a Southern
Pacific railroad conductor; Dr. F. C.
Burke, of Ksmeralda: Roderick David
son, of Nogales, and a Spaniard named
j Rodriguez. AH were buried at Mazat
! Ian.
According to the story related by L.
McKinnon of Los Angeles, the men
slain near Rosario were accompanied
j by V. H. York, his wife, two children,
and Dr. Burke's daughter. They left
the town of Acapuneta on three hand
! cars manned with Mexican crews early
on the morning of April 2 for Rosario.
! where they intended to board a train
! for Mazatlan.
Killed April 4.
On the morning of April 4 the party
i stopped in a small culvert, about four
' miles from Rosario to have breakfast.
Wallace, Davidson and Rodriguez left
j the hand cars for the top of the hill
! to see if all was well and as they
' reached the crest a volley of shots
; rang out. All three men were killed
' instantly.
Dr. Burke handed his small daugh-
ter to Mrs- York as a band of ten
: bandits, yelling like fienda, slid down
the culvert and made for the hand
cars. He had no sooner gotten the
child out of his arms than he fell
dead with four bullet holes in his head
and breast.
The three children then clung to
Y'ork and their pitiful pleading for his
life evidently moved the bandits for
they lowered their guns. The bandit
chief, however, ordered his men to
kill every "gringo" present, including
Mrs- York and the three children.
"Do your duty," he shouted to the
bandits. The children clung to York
and when the bandit chief, after many
curses, saw that his men would not
fire, he ordered them to loot every
thing in sight. This they did, later
permitting the party to proceed to Ro
sario with the dead.

Representatives of several twine

commission were approved by the in-i
vest igati on committee it would be able

It wished.
"The increased price of sisal already
made will compel the Ameritan far- j
mer to pay over $5,000,000 more for i
binder twine litis year," said he. Mr. j
Legge declared his lirm's only re!a- j
tions with the Plymouth. Cordage
company, were those of a competitor. ,
"The open market in sisal." said Mr. i

given by Sol Wexier and his asso
ciated American bankers, tne commis
sion now has absolute control ot tiie
supply and is in a position to withhold
it from the market until it secures tne
price demanded. It has already raised
the price two cents a pound.
"If the government of the United
States permits tiais monopoly, the twine
manufacturers can continue to do
business but the increased cost will
come out ot the consumer. He will
be able to buy sisal and sell twine at
prices based on the cost of the raw
material as we have done in the past.
But as the price of binder twine goes
up the America manufacturers must
be able to show they are not respon
sible lor the increase.
"The real question is what is to be
done with a monopolistic combination
which claims exemption from our
anti-trust laws on the ground the mon
opoly is created in Yucatan and is only
carried into effect in the United
States although the American bankers
furnish the money which they them
selves claim is essential to the effi
cient operation of the monopoly?"

Turks Sunk Hospital Ship.
Berlin, April 17 (Via Wireless to
Tuckerton. N. J.) Announcement is
made by the Turkish government that
the Russian hospital ship Portugal,
sunk in the Black sea last month, was
torpedoed by a Turkish submarine.
The statement was given out yesterday
by the Overseas News agency as fol
lows :
"The Turkish government publishes
the following report of the commander
of the Turkish submarine which sank
the steamship Portugal:
" The ship was signted the night of
March 29-30. It was steering to ard
a landing place. When daybreak came
it was ascertained that the ship was
laden heavily and that it was towintr
several heavily loaded punts, with nu
merous occupants. The commander
and other officers of the submarine
vere justified in believing the shin
was a transport which was on the w iy
to land troops and supplies. The ship
was painted gray, with a small red
yne, and new the Russian merchant
Pag. No Red Cross flag was flying
nnd the name of the ship was invisible.
First, Toredo Missed.
" 'The first torpedo did .not .hit.
After the explosion of the second tor
pedo, which struck below the bridge, a
violent explosion occurred within the
ship. This explosion undoubtedly wis
due to large quantities of explosives
etored in the ship. Immediately after
this a destroyer attacked the subma
rine." "

Christopher W. O'Brien Will
Betnrn to California.
Must Answer to a Charge of
Grand Larceny.
STOLE HIS WIFE'S DIAMONDS
Kude Awakening of Love's
Young Dream, Told by Police.
She Was a Stenographer and
Had Got Him a Job.
j Christopher W. O'Brien was today
j taken to Sacramento, Cal.. where he
must answer a charge of the theft of
i $2,000 worth of diamonds belonging to
his stenographer bride. O'Brien sur-
rendered himself to Sheriff Kiene of
Shawnee county a week ago. The
man's downfall is a story of brief,
impassioned love, a hasty wedding to a
pretty stenographer, a good job for
full measure and duplicity and treach-
ery as told today in the office of Gov
ernor Capper, who honored a requi-
. sitnm from Governor Johnson.
Complaint against O'Brien was
made by Nanete O'Brien, the man's
! wife. It was she who lost her love and
' $2,000 worth of diamonds all in the
brief space of a few weeks, according
: to the story as related by H. M. Rible,
Sacramento x'olice sergeant, who came
to Topeka with papers for O'Brien's
return to California.
Nanette O'Brien was a pretty sten
! ographer in the offices of the Pacific
; Gas & Electric company when O'Brien
' came on the scene. The young woman
had been an employee of the company
I for several years. She was young, at
tractive and impressed O'Brien when
he first met her.
"He made love to the woman from
the start," Rible stated today- "It was
' one of those cases of love at first
; sight, I guess. It was but a short
j time until they were married."
She Got Him a Job.
O'Brien was without employment.
! So Mrs- O'Brien was all that a real,
true, loving wife should be. She went
1 to the offices of the company, intro
; duced her husband to the manaytr
and secured for him a position as a
; solicitor.
"I have known the girl fifteen
; years," said Rible. "and they seemed
j to be getting along famously. It was
j just about the happiest little home
. you could imagine. O'Brien had a
job, the bride was happy and every
i thing was well.
j "Then one day O'Brien was missing.
A little investigation showed, also, that
J the stenographer bride's diamonds
1 were also gone. Both seemed to go
! at the same time husband and jew
I elry."
Then Mis. O'Brien tearfully told her
story to the police. They looked for
the ardent lover, but he wasn't in the
i city. He was not found until last
week when a telegram from Sheriff
I Kiene told of the surrender of the
! man to the county officials. Q'Brien
had walked into the sheriff's office,
stated he was wanted in California
for grand larceny, and asked to be
locked up. Requisitions for O'Brien's
j return were today honored by Gover
: nor Capper and the man will be re
turned to California for trial unless
i Mrs. O'Brien changes her mind and
refuses to testify against her husband.
A requisition was also honored to
day for the removal of Ed Baruch
from Smith county. Kansas, to Jack
son county, Missouri, where he Is
wanted on a grand larceny charge. It
is claimed that he stole jewelry val
ued at $24 2. The man is under arrest
in Smith Center.

ment was made at the White House
today that President Wilson had prac
tically completed consideration of the
forthcoming communication to Ger
many and it was indicated that it

today or tomorrow.
President Wilson, it was said, has
been steadily engaged on the note for
two days. He did not go to church
yesterday but worked practically all
day examining evidence submitted by
the state department.
The document, officials said, will
press the submarine issue to a deci-
sion. It was reiterated that the Sus
sex case would form only a link in the
chain of evidence the United States
will present to Germany to show
that her promises have not been ful
filled. Wil-on in Positive Tone.
The document was characterized by
! officials today as being very positive
in tone and they believed that only a
j prompt acquiescence by Germany in
the position taken by the United States
. can prevent a break in diplomatic re
j lation. Unofficial dispatches from

"At this point the American colonel

BODY TO JUAREZ?
Oavira Would Bring It to Bor

But No Official News Reaches
Pe Facto on Death
El Paso. April 17. Confirmation of
Mexican reports that Francisco Villa's
body had been exhumed at San Fran
cisco, Borja. and was being brought tn
Chihuahua was still lacking at Juarex
today.
Gabriel Gavira, commander of th
Juarez garrison awaited information
from official sources that would dispe!
doubt fo reports of the finding of thn
bandit's body, but the Mexican tele
graph lines brought no new informa
tion. "t still feel reasonably certain that
the messages received Sunday over the
Mexican land lines that Villa's body
had been found are correct," said
Andres Garcia. Mexican consul here,
today. "I shall make every effort ttt
have the body brought to Juarve.
where scores of Americans who knew
him may make an identification that
will be completely satisfactory' to the
American people. We should have
some official information about t he
Villa reports today."
Obregon KeMrted It.
The de facto government officialtf
were no' able to give any informatio
regarding an unofficial dispatch from
Mexico City stating that Minister of
War Obregon had announced that
Villa's body was buried in San Fran
cisco. Bo.ja, and was not en route to
Chihuahua City. It was bettered he-e
that there was lonw error in the cable
and telegraphic 'transmission of ths
Mexico City dispatch. Consul Garcia'a
information was that the body of Villa
had been exhumed at Ssn Francisco.
Borja,. and was being brought into
Cusihuiriachic. whence It was to be
sent on a special train to Chihuahua
City.
Official word from Washington that
United States troops would be imme
diately withdrawn from Mexico if Villa,
was dead will undoubtedly result In
expediting the effort of the de facto
government to ascertain the truth of
t he reports of the locating of Vi!ba
body and to make a full and iatisfy
ing identification. If the suppose ,
body of the bandit still is interred -'at
