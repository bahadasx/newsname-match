WASHINGTON-. April 17.?As the
hours pass without confirmation of the
story of the finding of the body of
Francisco Villa Washington grows
more doubtful.
Villa's body was to have reached
Chihuahua City by special train sometime
Sunday night but American Consul
I.etcher has not even forwarded
j the rumor as to Villa's death, which
must be circulating there.
The (Mexican embassy here had no
additional Information. Its last report
from Consul Garcia at El Paso
said he was seeking confirmation.
State and war department officials
(refused to comment Monday on Gen.
eral Pershing's report of the Parral
tight, which is much different from
the version transmitted by General
Carranza to support his suggestion
that the American troops be withdrawn.
The Ameiican report shows
!| that Carranza troops not only joined
, In the attack upon the little detach
ment or Americans, nui ionowea
: (hem several miles as they withdrew
to avoid a clash. The majority of the
Mexicans killed are reported by General
Pershing to have been Carranza
soldiers, one of whom was an officer.
' It was indicated at the state deI
partraent that further details would
i be sought from American officer sbefore
a reply would be sent to General
Carranza.
Secretary Lansing planned originally
to deal with the Parral incident as
a separate question and not In the reply
to the note suggesting the recall
of the American expedition.
It was re-asserted Monday that
should the body be identified as that
of Villa the expedition would come out
of Mexico at once.
No Instructions have been sent to
Consul Letcher or General Pershing
as to the identification to bo required.
| None will go forward until these officials
transmit some report.

A burglar or two seems to have a

drug store. The 'place was entered
and robbed about four months
ago and Saturday night it was entered
and robbed again, evidently by the
same person, or persons.
'Entrance this time was gained .to the
ware house In the rear of the store by
tearing a hole In a wall, as was the
case in the previous burglary, but the
rear door of tho store this time defied
all efforts of the thieves despite the
jftet that they had a big Jimmy along.

NEW YORK, April 17?The price

to advance still further because of

that the expense of publishing prayer

that buyers have been obliged
to pay nearly double the prices of
