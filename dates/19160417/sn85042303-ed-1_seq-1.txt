GABRIEL GAVIRA. THE CARRANZA COMMANDER AT
JUAREZ, HOWEVER. IS STILL CONFIDENT THAT
REPORT WAS TRUE.
Dispatch to Gavira at Ten Thirty Today from Cuihuirach says
the Body of Villa Had Not Arrived There and the Belief
grows that there was rs, -bably an Error in the Mexico
City Message Last Nigh ing that Obregon Announced
the Burial of Villa in Sa ncisco Borja and Now en
Route to Chihuahua None he Latest Messages from
Mexico Bring Confirmation o St ort that Villa's Body is
Being Brought to the Border Iv 'j es Over Wires of the
Northwestern Railroad from Chi. v ia Sunday Brought
the Report that Villa's Dead Body Been Secured by
Carranza TrooDS and Was Being Bro into Chihuahua.
El Paso, Tex., April 17.
Confirmation of the Mexican
reports that Villa's body has
been exhumed and is being
brought to Chihuahua is still
lacking at Juarez today.
Gabriel Gavira, the com
mander of the Juarez Garrison,
said: "I still feel reasonably
certain that Sunday's message
over the Mexican land line, of
Villa's body being found, are
correct."
A dispatch to Gavira at
10:30 today from Cusihuira
chie said that Villa's body had
not arrived there, and the be
lief is growing here that there
was probably an error in the
Mexico City message last night,
stating that Obregon had an
nounced the burial of Villa in
San Francisco Borja and is now
en route to Chihuahua.
Washington Without Confirmation.
Washington, April 17. War de
partment officials announced today
that none of the dispatches or tele
grams brought confirmation of the
finding of Villa's body.
Tends to Confirm Repoi.
Washington, April 17. Secretary of
War Baker received a dispatch from
Naco today saying that Villa was last
seen heading in the direction of the
Ipace where he was reported to have
been buried. This dispatch is taken
by the war department official? to
mean that the reports that Villa Is
dead may be true. President Wilson
was immediately given the report.
Consul 'Letcher has not even forward
ed the rumors of Villa's death from
Chihuahua City.
Much Excitement at El Paso.
HI Paso, Tex., April 17. Much ex
citement was caused here Sunday by
the report that Francisco Villa was
dead and that his body, which was
disinterred several days after his
burial, was in the possession of the
Carranza troops and was being taken
to Chihuahua. For more than a week (
reports of Villa's death from wounds '
have been current here and at Juarez
but Sunday's reports were apparently
the most circumstantial and reliable j
-of iwpivpil The Mexican North-
western dispatch at Juarez reported '
to General Gavira, the Juarez com
mander, that be had heard a conver
sation over the wires to the effect
that Villa's body was in the posses
sion of Carranza troops, and the
operators at Madera and Cusihuirach
ie operators also sent confirmation of
the report and that Villa's body whs
being taken to Chihuahua. The oper
ator at San Antonio, which is fifty
miles west of Chihuahua, said that
the body was in the possession of
Colonel Carlow Carranza, who is a
nephew of General Carranza.
Need More Native Scouts.
Columbus, N. M., April 17. General
Pershing has asked for more civilian
scouts, who are familiar with the
district south of Parral. Miliary men
here interpret this as meaning that
the finding of Villa's body has not
been confirmed, and that the cavalry
Is pushing forward, possibly into Du
rango. Starting New Revolution.
San Antonio, Tex., April 17. Gen
eral Antonio I. Villareals is attempt
ing to start a new revolution againn

VICE CROWDS OVERFLOW
BIG TABERNACLE THREE
THOUSAND ATTEND.
(By Dr. J. W. Burns)
A rich mental and spiritual diet
has been the portion of Ardmore
people ever since Evangelist Williams
of Chicago, reached the city. At his
very first appearance he was greeted
with a good-sized congregation,
which grew at each service, until
last night more than three thousand
people bent every effort to catch his
magic words in the lecture, "The
Iiible: Is It From God?" At an early
hour a mass of humanity began to
pour into the great tabernacle and
before the speaker addressed his au
dience, scores were being turnd away
for lack of room. Chairs wre car
ried into the aisles and occupied,
many stood along the walls at the
rear of the building, and crowds
stood in the doorways. Perhaps
Ardmore never saw before such a
demonstration at a religious gather
ing. Perfect order was maintained,
and every auditor was eager to catch
each note of the speaker's voice. In
his free and pleasing manner of
speech the evangelist for more than
an hour gave striking reasons why
our lfible is from God. His proofs
were conclusive, aud completely fore
closed any other hypothesis.
Trof. II. J. Bray and wife are at
their best, and they are leading a
chorus which last n'ght was made up
of about three hundred fifty. Prof.
Bray is a master at his work. As
sisting the choir last night was an
orchestra which was enjoyed by all.
Following the singing of a selection
last night, in which the chorus had
completely filled the volume of the
big tabernacle, Prof. Bray said: "I
never heard such singing as I am
hearing right here tonight." The
evangelist then said: "This is the
first time for over a year that we
have found our building too small.
I wish we had built it larger."
The services will begin promptly
each evening at 7:45. There will be
services tonight, but likely after this
there will be no services on Monday
night. .Announcement of all services
will be made from time to time in
the columns of The Arumoreitc. To
morrow we will be able to announce
the time and place of the cottage
prayer meetings to be held during the
week.
Saturday night, the evangelist spoke
on the subject of revivals. He took
the book of Nehemiah for his text.
He told of how Nehemiah went to
the king bemoaning the destruction of
Jerusalem and its walls. The king
was good and gave him premission to
go and rebuild the sam. A permit
was given him to use the resources
Of the kingdom at so doing. Neue
niiah went and met objections from
those opposed to the work for sel
fish reasons. So one person always
gets the first idea of a great under
taking. He communicates it to oth
ers, and the work begins. It's the
anxiety on the heart of the first in
dividual that starts it. The speaker

EXPECTS VAST DEVELOPMENT
Illinois Oil Man Sees Wonderful Ac
tivity Here.
J. I. Dunn of Bridgeport, 111., who is
a successful oil operator, is spending
a number of days here. He thinks well
of the outlook at Healdton and the ter
ritory surrounding that field. In a re
cent conversation with a good friend
of his he said that Carter county was
in the midst of a great oil develop
ment that would place fortunes to the
credit of many men and advises that
acreage be taken where it can be
bought reasonably, and says the next
best buy is Ardmore , properly. He
feels that Ardmore must do much
growing as the result of the bringing
in of a series of oil pools which lie
thinks are certain to be discovered
here from time to time.

Wilson's Note Will Emphasize that the

Uromises Have Not Been Kept.
Washington, D. ('., April 17. Pros
ident Wilson has practically complet
ed his communication to Germany ami
it probably will go to Berlin late to
day 'or tomorrow, it was announced
today.
It is said that the document will
press the submarine issue to a de
cision. It is emphasized that the Sus
sex case forms only a link in the
chain of evidence that Germany's
promises have not been kept.
The note is characterized by offi
cials as being very positive in tone,
and they believe that only a prompt
acquiescence in the position taken by
the United States can prevent a break
in thw diplomatic relations.
NORMAL SCHOOL AT HOME
Announcement of Much Interest to
Young Teachers of the County.
Upon his return to Oklahoma City
fron. .Ardmore, State Supt. Wilson no
tified City Supt. Uichards that all per
sons who complete the Normal Train
ing Course as prescribed by the Ard
more high school will beg ranted a
two-year teachers' certificate. Partic
ulars concerning the course may bo
had by applying to Supt. Kichards.
This message is fraught with much
meaning to Ardmore young folks who
desire to teach. Jt means that they
have a normal school at their own door
that Is given state recognition and
state certificate scan b eobtained with
out the expense of an examination or
a course at one of the normal schools
located away from home. It is pos
sible that the high school will gradu
ally take the place of the normal
school.
P
HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN
THE CITY AND PEOPLE ARE
ANXIOUS TO KNOW WHAT IS
GOING TO BE DONE.
The new method of lighting streets
which is popularly termed "the white
way" has been demonstrated in this
city, and the citizens have had ample
opportunity of comparing it with the
old system.
The question which now confronts
the city, according to statements of
city officials, is: Will the property
owners along .Main street bo willing
lo install the necessary equipment,
and will the taxpayers be willing to
pay their share of the cost, if there
is any involved?
H. K. Foster, of the Ardmore I p,
Light & power company, at his own
expense, installed the block now in
operation, with the understanding that
it a to be for the edification of the
itij!ns for a certain piriod. That
period is pa -ted, arid it is now up to
the city to make the nut move, and
etiher adopt the system or reject it
entirely.
The matter will probably be takon
up by the city commissioners within
a short time, and some disposition
made of the white way question. The
concensus of opinion fei-ms to be
that the system should be adopted,
along Main street, at least, and the
old method dispensed with.

OIL MAN'S PLAN
Louis Campbell Tips Off War Depart
ment on plan to Capture Villa.
Louis Campbell, who is here from
Tulsa, representing the Magnolia
Petroleum company, has a plan for
catching Villa which lie recommends
to the war department of the United
States. His plan is for the govern
ment to give hi ri an allotment in
the Healdton field in Carter county
and start the lease scouts after him.
The plan was suggested to Mr.
Campbell in the Barney Thlocco in
cident which occurred in the Cushing
field. Barney Tlilocco was said to
have been a Creek Indian. By acci
dent he was given an allotment in
Cushing. The Indian is said to have
gotten in bad in some way, and went
to Mexico to join one of the revolu
tionary faction!. Purchasers offertd
fancy prices for his lea, but Harney
was gone, and his property could not
1h purchased. Scouts immediately
left for Mexico and they succeeded
in finding about thirty Harney Thloc
cos, all claiiiiinR to b thu original
Barney, all claiming Creek blood,
all claiming to have allotted the
land at Cushing. Mr. Campbell is of,
the opinion that the lease scouts
under the same circumstances could
bring Villa to the United States and
end the punitive expedition.
At any rate what there is of the
United Slates army is being trained
in the methods of up to-date warfare.
TRENCH OFFENSIVE
After temporarily assuming'
the aggressive in the Verdun
battle by launching attacks in
Douaniont Vauv region, which
is declared gained them some
ground, the French are holding
their infantry in check today.
The German infantry is also
silent, Paris says.
Apparently a new movement
of some importance is in pre
paration west of the Meuse,
where the Germans report the
bringing down of two hostile
aeroplanes, one aviator bring
ing down his fifth adversary.
With its entrance upon the
ninth week, the Verdun battle
has become the greatest in the
world's history. The lighting
has been almost continuous
during that time. The losses
have exceeded those of any
previous battle, with no appar
ent termination of the battle
for possession of this great fort
ress. French Aeroplanes Active
Paris, April 17. Two French aerial
squadrons are active on the Saloniki
front, I lavas reports. One dropped
bombs Sunday on the Bulgarian forces
at Strumnitza Station, while the other
attacked the Germans at Bogdantze.
Both squadrons returned undamaged.
FRUIT DOING WELL
Harirson Says Peaches, Plums, Apples
and Cherries are Making Crop.
It. H. Harrison who is making the
race for county commissioner in the
first district and who is a progressive
farmer of the county, states that lie
has recently made a thorough inves
tigation of his fruit crop. He fiinds,
that his plums, peaches, cherries, and
apples, are doing well, and have not
been ruined by the freeze during the;
early part of the month. This will bo
good news to the people of the county
who have been uneasy about the safe
ty of the crop. Mr. Harrison states
that oats need a few days of warm
sunshine and that corn In many fields
Is being replanted on account of the
freeze.
IF A CHICKEN DISOBEY LAW,
SHOOT HIM (OR HER)
Acting Mayor I.asher stated this
morning that there was going to be
some drastic action taken to abate
I the nuisance of chickens running at
I large and ruining neighbors' gardens.
The law on the statute books is very
plain, and the pound officer will re
ceive instructions to begin a crusado
with a small-g:"jge shotgun and
shoot all fowls found running at
large, and also summon the owner to
appear in the city court, if the owner
can be fuund.
Hardens in the past have been ruin
ed, and the owners thereof refrained
from starting a rough house for the
reason that they desired to get along
peaceably with their neighbors. The
la,w will now take the responsibility
off their shoulders, and the pound
man with the little shotgun and the
scavenger man with his cart will be
busy for the next few days, unless
there is a radienl change in the man
ner of raising chickens in Ardmore.
