an animated discussion, in which Mrs.
J. Hungerford Millbank, head of the
organization, aserted that the suits
worn by the women need not neces
sarily he uniform. She objected to
trousers, on the ground that sucn a
uniform would be opposed by hus
bands. Others denounced dresses as a
"curse pnd burden' to women and ad
vised the women soldiers to get rid
of them. "When your husband's go
to the front.' said one speaker, "You
will have to guard your home against
marauders. It will be a man's work
and you cannot do it in dresses.''

Captive, Betrayed Burial
His Freedom
TO THE CITY OF JUAREZ
Convinced That the Outlaw is
Said to be Gangrenous, With
Have Reached State Depart
Neither th sta;e or war department
had any confirmatory advices on the
subject from American sources. Re
ports Teaching El Paso and other bor
der points were forwarded for infor
mation, but neither American consuls
nor military authorities in Mexico were
heard from. There was no attempt
here 13 disguise their eager interest in
the reported killing of the bandit. Ev
ery message received was closely
scrutinized ?.t the state department
and sent to the White House. In
some quarters there was a disposition
to credit them notwithstanding the fact
that border leports generally have
been -Mewed with so much suspicion
since the put suit began.
Must Have Complete Identification.
Officials w.uld not discuss what
proof they would deem necessary to
establ:s.li the fact that the body men
tioned in these reports is that of Villa.
It is certain, however, that every ef
fort will be made to obtain so complete
an identification as to make sure be
yond reasonable doubt that the man
who waged war with a few hundred
bandit- against the United Suites and
the de facto government of Mexico
simultaneously has paid the penalty.
Consul Letcher at Chihuahua should be
able to mako the identification. Cus
toms Collector Cobb at El Paso in
formel the state department late to
day tpat Mexican customs officials at
Juares had told him the body of the
bandit had been found and would -be
taken tonight to Chihuahua City.
The Mexicrn embassy earlier had re
ceived the following message from
Mexican Consul Garcia at El Paso:

CONGRESS HUSTLING THE
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
Notwithstanding Anxiety Regarding
German and Mexican Situations.
Washington, April 16. Congress is
going ahead rapidly on the legislative
program with its working machinery
unimpeded by excitement over inter
national affairs. Although there has
been more anxiety regarding the Ger
man and Mexican situations in the la-t
week than at any time since the ses
sion began, members of both houses
have been keeping strictly to the bus
iness of legislation.
Silence in congress, however, by no
means indicates a lack of int-st in
international affairs. In fact, the qui?-t
is ominous, particularly with regard to
the submarine issue. Senate and
house leaders of. the foreign relations
committees are daily expecting a call
to the White House or Secretary
Iansing's office, where they are to be
informed what the administration pro
poses to do as soon as the p'-un of
action is determined. The same i:i
true of the Mexican tiuestion. although
congress already understands and, so
far. the majority approve, the deter
mination of the executive to keep
American troops on the trail in Mexi
co while negotiations are undertaken
with Carranze regarding his su3'es
tion for their withdrawal from Mexi
can territory. Republicans j retty gen
erally oppose withdrawing the troops
at this time r.v.i' some democrats are
against rcc;Vi'.v ;r soldiers until
there i- xrmation re
ding the fat of Villa.
The a-;. . . .. - irrating dis
cussion ot tin .-limy reorganization
bill which 'probably will be passed
Tuesday. Debate u 'dtr the five min
ute rule may extend the discussion
another day, but in any event, the
measure will be passed before the end
of the week. When the bill is disposed
of, the senate will probably take up
the good roads bill, which has been
reported by the postofHco committee.
the senate is also interested m the
Brandeis case and the judiciary com
mittee will meet again tomorrow to
consider the sub-committee report rec
ommending Brandeis' confirmation as
a nominee for justice of the supreme
court. A vote is not expected imme
diately. With the agricultural appropriation
bin Tlisposed of on Friday at the laXent,
the house will probably begin consid
eration of the Philippine bill. Or. the
Philippine measure party lines doubt
less will be broken down despite the
stmng sanction of the measure by the
White House.

TURKISH SUBMARINE SANK

Believed Steamer Portugal Was a
Transport and About to Land Troops
Berlin, April 16. (By wireless to
Tiukerlon. X. J.) Announcement is
made 1 y the Turkish government that
the Russian hospital ship Portuaal.
rfiink in the Black Sea last month, was
torpedoed by a Turkish submarine.
The statement wash given out todnv
by the Overseas Xews Agency as fol
lows :
"The Turkish government publishes
the following report of the commander
of the Turkish submarine which sank
the steamship Portugal.
"The ship was sighted on the nisht
of March 20-:U). It was steering to
ward a tending place. When eiaybreik
came it was ascertained that th ship
was laden heavily and that it w:is
towing several heavily loaded punts
with numerous occupants. The com
mander and other officer"? of the sub
marine were justified in believing th.
ship was a transport which wns on
the way to land troops and sunpl'cd.
j tie snip was painted gray, v-ith a
small red line and flew the Russian
merchant flag. Xo Red "ro! flag was
flying and the name of the thi; w.e:
invisible.
"The first torpedo did not hit. Af-
! ter the explosion of the second torpedo
wnicn struck netow the bridge, a vio
lent explosion occurred within the ship
This explosion undoubtedly wr.s Hi
to larsre quantities of explosives store 1
in the ship. Immediately after this a
destroyed attacked the submarine.
"The Russian affirmation that the
ship was strvk by two torpedoes is
untrue. The Turkish government re
grets if persons exclusively in the Re:l
Cross service perirhed. but the respon
sibility rests on the Russian govern
ment which transported these persons
fn a vessel which was being used for
war purposes ngalnst the Turks.
"Provisions of the convention1; adopt
ed at The Hague stipulate that hos
pital ships must be painted white, with
a green or red stripe one and one hi'f
