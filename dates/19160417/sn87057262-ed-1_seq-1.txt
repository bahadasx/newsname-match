Is Said to Have Died After Amputation of Leg
and Buried in Lonely Grave Up on
the Mountain.
lUS 1ST IDENTIFY THE CORPSE
Pursuit of the Outlaw Will Not be Terminated
Unless the Body is Proven to be
I That of Pancho.
[By E. T. Conkle, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
EL PASO, Texas, April 17.—Villa
may be dead as reported. But Ameri
can army officials here early today
were anxious that the body of the
bandit leader be identified by Ameri
cans in addition to the identifications
by Mexicans.
It is generally supposed here that
It Villa is dead the American soldiers
will soon be withdrawn from Mexico.
General Pershing knows Villa.
Pershing was near the spot where
the supposed body of Villa was ex
humed. If he was not asked 'o
identify the remains, it is hoped that
he may be able to report something
definite about the circumstanced of
Villa's end.
The story from unconfirmed Mexi
can sources is that Villa died two
weeks ago following the amputation
of his right leg due to a wound suf
fered in the fight with the Guerrero
Carranzista garrison on March 28.
He was said to have been secretly
buried by a few of his men. Some
of the Americans who left for Chi
huahua, marched with Villa for
months during his campaigns against
Huerta and know practically his
every physical peculiarity. Unless
the corpse is badly mutilated or de
composed, they will not be deceived.
American officials have feared since
Villa was first reported dead or dying
that Mexicans might produce a body
said to be Villa's, make a hurried
Identification and then bury it as a
means of terminating the United
States expedition's presence on Mexi
can soil. Carlos Carranza, a nephew
of the defacto government's chief,
headed the Carranza detachment
which located the supposed body of
Villa.
They are understood to be bringing
the remains on a special train due in
Chihuahua today. As a number of
officials there know Villa intimately,
Identification is expected immediate
ly after Carlos Carranza arrives in
Chihuahua with the body. All indica
tions are that this story of Villa's
end is reliable, although as yet not
officially confirmed. Villa was once
treated by El Paso specialists for a
virulent blood disease. These experts
now declare that if wounded by a bul
let, gangreen would have followed un
less the wound received skilful atten
tion. There was no competent sur
geon with Villa's band or in the ter
ritory around Guerrero. The village
doctor reported to have operated on
Villa was believed to have been
crude.
"It's a four to one shot that the
body is Villa's," said Carranza Con
sul Garcia. "I cannot say that I posi
tively know he is dea'd, but I have
asked to have the body sent to Juarez
so Americans here can satisfy them
selves."

MEXICO CITY, April 17.—War
Minister ObTegon today telegraphed
to Carlos Carranza. nephew of Gen
eral Carranza, asking him to con
firm, if possible, the report that
Villa's body has been found.
In view of the numerous telegraphic
reports from Chihuahua City and
Juarez, officials were inclined to be
lieve the news may be true.
It was pointed out, however, that
similar reports have been spread by
the Villistas to slacken the pursuit
of the bandit leader and have been
found to be false.
General Carranza, busy with the
festivities arranged in honor of his
arrival, would make no comment to
day, either on the report of Villa's
death or the negotiations with the
United States.
