Vienna, Sept. It. With a keen
louring for peace has come persistent
speculation of the central states, as to
Die manner in which this blessing may
I, ,, secured. Hut all thought on the
lubjuct is but the substance of the
person'l own wishes. Political and
military circles today are as far from
welng I definite plan for the cessa
tion nf war as they were In the he-
llsnlng.
No Pear of Dismemberment
"If the fear prevailed In the central
states that a peace with honor, and
possibly profit, could not be secured,
then thought must run in a different
channel. BUI that the entente has not
shown that it can ultimately realize its
own hopes, it Is the universal view In
Austrian-Hungary anu Gsrmany, and
II, , ir allied countries. The offensive
on the Homme, the Russian attack In
BttkOWina, and in east Halicia, the
entry into the war of Rumania, and
its immediate consequences; the cam-
. , ....i. .-n.i .....i ,i ...Hiimi. . i
of the italianV have 'aHonWWntW
toward the feeling ln the central group
that the resistance met hy the entente
innv yet open the eyes in tliose who
must first announce that they will he
satisfied with a peace whose terms
will not have the dismemberment of
central Kurope as a basis.
Uermmiy's Terms Stated,
The oentra governments are reads',
today fin- a pea OS whlc woulil leave j
Kurope very much as before the war,
with, the exception that Poland must j
he made an SUtomonOUl state, and that ;
neither I'.elgium nor Serbia can again;
trouble, innocently or purposely, the
There i.s hero not the faintest Indl- I
ration that the entente Is inclined to
enter negotiations on that basis. In
Vienna ami in Berlin, on the other
hand, nobody can yet see why the Cen
tral group should make concessions,
since they claim to hold trumps ev
erywhere by the occupation of enemy
territories so large that the few ad
vantages gained by the entente can
hardly count.
Had the summer operations driven
the central troops out of France and
Russia things would be different. The
Bomme offensive has merely shown
lie online, to the people here, that the
teel wall of the Germana in the west
may be bent, but cannot be broken,
while resistance in the east has been
splendid, numbers considered. The
Italians have again been obliged to
take breath. So long as the entento
oannot convince the public of the cen
trul slates that it Is gaining militarily
the necessity of making concessions
Will not break upon the central Kuro
peen mind,
it evident that the government
and public are one, on this subject.'
There is much grumbling about this
or that regulation, but all these things j
are trifles compared with the great
objective that the war must not be I
lest.
itu-sia Not Read for Peace.
There is m, evidence that Russia
would be the first to make peace !
Nevertheless that country Is thought1
of in this manner. Pence rumors at-!
ways have Russia in mind. Possibly!
this i.s due to the belief that Itussia1
I after all, the most vulnerable of the!
entente powers. In military circles, ,
a further occupation of Russian ter
ritory by means of another German
offensive is accepted as highly feas
ible. Iliudenburg's elevation to chief
of stair of the Qerman army has re
rived assertions that during the wln
t( i there will be another Itussian cam-
paiga.
Must Maintain Strength,
To Conclude a peace that will not
''e made at its own cost, the central
powers feel that their armies must re-
' "n their o resent nronortionate 1
"tr.-riutlis and efficiency--that their
loaaea must nni i... uii in nronor- 1
lion than those of the entente forces. I
Before the Hritlsh millions had an- !
l" ro, id,, s, there was always
the vague fear that things might go
w,'ng. once they took their place.
But the Somme operations have j
shown that while the Hritish millions,
have been of much help to the
"rsnch, their coming has not been
deefsree.
't is argurd now that with the j
laige Hritish fort ee assimilated In the i
""btary ensemble, and with the Itu- j
Rants army a known quantity, fur
et eoooeaagssia worth while can
'onie to the entente only from Its I
OWa population growth, as more men !

lv not peculiar to the central allied
states. About eighteen per thousand
