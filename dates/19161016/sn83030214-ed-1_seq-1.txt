hnndred men In single file. While his
lunch grew cold Warden Osborne held
an Impromptu reception in the prison
yard.
He shook hands with every prisoner,
and for every one he had a kindly word.
Nor was there anything Impersonal
about it. Not once did Mr. Osbome's
memory fail him; he had every man's
name ready as his hand went out
On the side of the men there was a
vast deal of mumbling, a few intelli

grip that their ex-warden wil! remem?
ber for days to come. A gray little man,
who will die In prison unless somehow
luck Intervenes, and whose privileges
as trusty have been revoked following

GETS REJWBRANDT
Buys "Old Woman Reflect
ing Over Lecture" for
Country Gallery
A Rembrandt entitled "An Old
Woman Reflecting Over the Lecture,"
one of the paintings ln the famoui col?
lection of Julei Porges, of Paris. has
just been acquired by Henry C. Frick
for hii gallery at Pride's Crossing,
Mass.
The palnting, which was purcheaed
direct from M. Porges by Mr. Friei
for $250,000. is the fourth Rembrandt
to enter the Frick collection. The
others are the faraoua "Polish Rider,"
"Portrait of Rembrandt" and "Portrait
of ar. Artist"
With the acquisition of thia lateit
painting it is estimated that within the
year Mr. Frick has spent about $2,
LOO.OOO for famous canvases.
When taken to the Frick home the
new owner accorded his latest Rem?
brandt a place of honor between the
| "Portrait of a Man," by Frans Hals,
and Van Dyck's "Portrait of the
Duchess de Brignola Sala." It wai
Ipalnted In 1649, when Rembrandt was
i forty-three.
"The subject of the pieture."' sald an
I art critic, "ia a very old woman. with
! a eweetly melancholy face, in which the
Forrowa and dlsilluslonments of life
; have falled to take anything away.
' Rembrandt gave this face the utmost
j paina. In it there are a thousand wrin
kles, and the stretching of the skin
over the bone-work of the face is most
realisticallv painted. It ls only in the
clrapery that Rembrandt used his brush
hroadly. She wears red headgear. a
brownish dress with whita sleeves. a
piece of brown fnr about her shoulders
and a golden collar."
The painting was exhihlted ln 1911
'? in the L'xhihif.on of the Great and Lit*

CANCER RELIEF
IN SELENIUM,
DOCTOR SAYS
Drug Treatment Used
on 200 in Five
Year Test
ALL BENEFITED
REPORT SHOWS
Cure May Result from
Experiments by New
Method
Marked success In the treatment of
csneer by selenium is soon to be an?
nounced in medical publleatlons by
| Dr. Charles H. Walker, of S27 West
K:ghty-sixth Street Selenium ia a
. powerful chemical whieh, taken inter
| nally, in capsulea, has relie4-ed suffer
I ing In many cases and in others has
' effected an apparent cure.
Dr. Walker, however, does not say
! he has found a cure, but he firmly be
lieves tho treatment is worthy of a
' thorough trial.
"I have treated in the last five yeara
more than two hundred casea," Dr.
Walker said to a Tribune reporter yes
i terdav. "In many of them diagnosis
! had anown bej-ond all question the na
i tient waa a cancer victim, and ln few
was there much ground for doubt I
1 can aafely say in no case was there a
total failure in favorable rflflflltl from
tho use of selenium.
Believea Cure Was Made
"Some of the patients were near
I death when I first saw them, ar.d it was
fiossible to do nothing but relieve a
ittle of their pain. In other cases,
j said by sprcialists to be beyond hrlp, I
believe there has been a prrmancnt
I cure. If selenium w.l! only relieve
paln it is worth u*ing. and if it will
cure, the treatment should be, thor
oughly investigated."
Sulfo-selene, a combination of buI
rhur nnd selenium, the compound Dr.
| Walker usea, waa workerl out In co?
operation with Dr. Frederick Klein, a
biologieal chemist, of this city.
In 1911 Dr. Walker eame to the con
clusion, upheld by eminent authorities
' on cancer, the diaease was not due to a
germ. but to a certain peculiar condi
| tion in the body, whieh might be cor
i rected by trea*trn#ftt with ehemlcals.
j Experiments with selenium were be?
gun and have been eontinued the laat
1 five years.
First Clew to Treatment
In a report published in "The Medi?
cal Record" in 1912 eminent surgeons
stated the remedy for cancer might
well be b chemical aubstance.
"It has long been the opinion of
thoughtful atudenta of the subject,"
; says the report, "that local treatments
for cancer, however, necessary as make
shifts, have been based on a miscon
ception. It is quite possible, for ex
; nmple, thst X-r?ys or the fulguratlon
I treatment may bent fit a superflcial can?
cer at its point ef origin, but the dan?
ger of such growtha liea largely in
their epread to dlstant and inaccesaible
vital organs, where local treatment Is
impossible.
"We believe it, therefore, axiomatie
that a scientifie remedy for cancer shall
: be one soluble in the blood, transmissi
, ble by the blood and lymph currenta to
all parts of the body, ana possessed of
a selective affinity for the eella of the
?? tumor to be destroyed.
Cancer No Germ Dlsa-as*
! "Such a remedy may quite eoneeiv
ably be a chemical Bubstance existing
in the outside world. and by happy ae
cident discovered to have the desired
i properties."
Dr. Francla Carter Wood, director of
I the Crocker Cancer Research Fund,
I speaking on the laboratory stuay of the
! causes of the disease at a meeting of
the New York Aeademy of Mcdicine last
May, aaid it had bern established. al
1 most beyond queation, that canc?r wa.s
not a germ diaease, nor in any way al?
lied to germ diaeases.
Dr. Klein, in 1910. recommended the
? use of selenium acid in the treatment
of cancer.
Dr. Wasserman subsequently an?
nounced he had found a compound of
| selenium whieh reduced cancers of
mice and rats, but in large doses killed
the animals. Others engaced in re
aearch work have been unable to fnd a
form of selenium that left healthy tis
sues uninjured. Another difficulty ha.*
been that the administration of the
drug led to aaturation and consequent
diminutlon in the effects of treatment.
Dleting a Nereweary Aid
"Dr. Klein and mvself have probably
r.ot found the final chemical form Ifl
whieh the use of selenium will be most
effective." said Dr. Walker. "but we
hope to. Its use must. of course, be
accompanied by the atrict dieting in?
evitable ln all tnat ments of cancer.

INFANT PLAGUE KILLS
PRINCETON FRESHMAN
Youth Believed to Have Been In

Prineeton, N. J., Oct 15. - Eric Brun
now, seventeen years old. a freshman
at Prineeton University, died in Prinee?
ton Inftrmary yesterday of infantile
paralysis.
Previous to the opening of Prineeton.
on Tuesday last, young Brunnow had
been visiting ln New York City for
three days. He showed no symptoms
of the disease before he left here. Dr.
George Draper, of the Rockefeller In?
stitute, of New York, injected serum
into the young man, but without avail.
John Grier Hibben, president of the
nniversity, last night gave out the
following statement by telephone de

"There will be no action taken hy
' thr faculty. Mr. Brunnow went to
N'ew York inr three days, r*?urning
herr on Tuesday. It is prohable that
Mr. Brunnow was exposed to the dis
? casr while in New York.
"We had five cases of infantile
1 narslysis in the infirmarv here five
' y*ais ago. They were iaofated in the
; intirmary, and the disease was held
! st lhat point. Any report that there
. is a likelihood of sending the faculty
and the students home for two weeks
oj rf quarantining them in college is
untrue."

Johns Hopkins Experts
Say Germs in Food
Foil Isolation
Baltimore, Oct 15. So satlsfaetory
are the results that have been obtained
in the campaign of Johns Hopkins Hos?
pital and the health authontiei against
infantile paralysis that the hospital,
usually so retieent regarding experi
mental research, gave out a new state?
ment to-day which gives hope that be?
fore another summer comes the dis?
ease can be combated successfully.
Dr. Horace T. Burrows. under whose
direction the seat of lnfectlon was
foond to be in the large lntestine has
obtained results tending to show per?
sonal quarantine, which is practically
the only preventive measure practised
now, is useless, and in the near future
a serum may be developed which will
be an effectual immunization measure.
Germs Bnstor _r Ma-th ??????
From the fact __at tha leat of l.feo
I tion llea In the large tnteitine, it is
arg*ied that foods and not persons
should be subject to scrutiny ln cheek
' ing the spread of the disease. Germs
can gain access to the large lntestine
onlv by entering the mouth.
As infants whose only sustenanee ls
milk and water have been rietima, it
is suggested that both those fluids may
be subject to infection. r'y-periment'
are now being carried on to show that
milk makes the germ grow and spreads
It from the colon Into the lymph ar.d
nerve f.bre of the lnteitines and thence
into the spinal cord.
Abstention from raw foods. sueh as
fruits, is urged. The infection may be
1 carried from place to place by fiiea
and other insecU sueh as abound near
| fruit stands. Steriliiatlon of milk and
water is also recommended.
Rr-emble Typhold Attrtbutea
Sueh attributes as have been discov
ered or deduced by the ecientists as
those of infantile paralysis bear a
: strong similanty to those of typhoid.
For this reason there is ground for
hope that a serum may be obtained
which will be as effectual ai ll the anti
typhoid serum.
It has been demonstrated that if the
rerms. which have now been grown in
_n incubator. are killed and antmals
are then inoculated with them in three
Buccessive injections the anirnal be
comes immune to po-*??.*'*-1^ Vhen?!"
partment of immunology at the? hos
Jital is already at work on a P"ventive
'acclne to be used on volunteers, who
will then be inoculated with the virus.
A rabbit used in the pathological de
par'ment to determine the means of
fransmitting the disease was found t?
day to have suffered paralysis of the
I leg, and from this luccessful experi
ment the investigators derive consider
I able satisfaction. ____________ v-w

Peril of Teuton
Invasion
London. Oct 15 Tbe widely hailed
Rumanian counter offensive ln Tran?
sylvania has died out in many sec-ors
where aucress seemed to be within the
gra?p of King Ferdinand's troops. Only
along the southern frontier is the Ru?
manians' desperate stand holding Fal
1 kenhayn's forces at arm's length from
; Rumanian soil. Flsewhere the Ruma
nians' hope of preventing the eventual
invasion of their country flick?*red only
for a moment and then was snuffe.i Bflt
by the fury of the enemy's flttack.
The day's fightine saw the abandon
ment by the Rumanians of a large part
of the territory in Eaatern Bnd North?
ern Transylvania whieh they had clung
to in the face of terriflc assaults. From
the Kelemen Mountain region. near the
Bukowina border they retreated to the
frontier. In the east the'.r linee were
dented in as far as the (irymes Paas,
on the frontier, through whieh runs the
Troitus River and a railroad to Kron
stadt.
1 Oa both sides of thfl Sxurduk Paa*.
, southtajr. of Kmnstadt, Rumaniancol
; umns were rolied baek and a domrnat*
ing ridge seized in Friday's counter
', charge was gwallowed up in the Teu
; ton wave.
Ruaaians Stlffen Ltnes
Along the southern frontier, and to
the north of it, where the Rumanians
have been able to retain part of the
' territory conquered ln the first great
rush acroas tbe border, Russian rein?
forcements have stiffened the Ruma?
nian linee and averted for the moment
the peril of invasion. In the Polistoca
Valley the momentum of yestcrday's
. smashing drive carried King Ferdi?
nand's troops forward until the enemy
was cleared out of this sector.
Standing with their backs to the wall
in the Vulcan. Red Tower and Tomos
passes, the most important gateways
on the Southern Tranaylvania. front, the
Rumanians fought with a de.speration
that beat baek all the enemy's attempts.
In the Jiul Valley, the scene of yes
terday's most notable success for Ru?
manian arms, two important summlts ?
Negri and Zancaza were wre.-*ted from
the grasp of the Austrians. South of
Hatzeg, in the same region. Vienna re?
ports that the Teutons have maintained
the entire frontier ridge.
Ifl the region north cf Kronstadt the
battle still rages furiously under con?
ditions more nearly approaching a
deadlock than at any other part of the
front. In the valleys of the Alt, Bicaz,
Uzul, Ruzeu and Oituz the incessant
pounding of the artillery is preventing
the infantry from grappling.
Here, however, the Rumanians ap?
pear to be at a disadvantatfe, as the
retirement of their lines to the north
and south has laid them open to flank
attacks. It ls here that King Ferdi
iiand and a newly organized staff of
French officers are reported to have
taken up their headquartera, with the
purpose of stemming the Teuton tide.
The situation as a whole is vastly
more encouraging to military men here
than that whieh existed during the first
wei*k of Falkenhayn's overwhelming
advance. The rallying of the Ruma?
nians under such depressing conditions
as they faced last week ll regarded as
a hopeful sign. The situation has been
altered suffleiently by the counter of?
fensive to give Rumania's allies oppor?
tunity to rush to her aid before the
'actual invasion of her land has been
begun. 'ritics by no means take as
pessimlstie a view of the situation as
that revealed in the appeal of the Ru?
manian monarch for succor.
Allies Press Ralgar*
On the Maeedonian front the Alliea
, arn attempting to increase the pressura
i on the Rulgar lines in the hope of
breaking through in time to divert part
of the enemy's forces from the drive
against Rumania.
The features et the day'a operations
were furnished by the French troops
under Sarrail, who cut the railroad
south of Seres, and by the Serbians,
who won aeveral enemy trenches on the
left *t?nk of the Cerna River. southeast
of Mo7*t?stir. The first move virtually
places the important town of Ser<*s in
one of the pocketa so familiar to Allied
atrateizy on the Somme front. The
Seres-Demir Hissar railroad has al
rrady been cut north of that town, and
the Allied forces are now pushing fflf*
44 ard on three flides of Seres. The
Serhs' success on the Cerna marks an?
other atep in the slow, mcthodical
crive on Monastir.
Furious artillery actions took plsee
along the rest of the front. The activity
of Allied patrois on the Doiran front
suggests that before long Sarrail will
attempt anotl er drive northward tow?
ard the Strumnitza.

U-Boat Base Was Destroyed
East Machias, Me., Oct IB.?An ex
plosion that shook this village about
4 a. m. Saturday and was heard ten
miles away revealed that a buildir.g at
the head of navigation on the East
Machias River had been used recretly
ai a storehouse for explos'.ves.
Efforts to ascertain the ownership of
the explosive were unsuecessful to-day,
but it was suggested that a base for
submarines had been disovered. How?
ever, reports that boats had been
heard passing up the river during a
heavy storm Friday night and Satur?
day morning could not be confirmed.
The coast guard station at Cross Isl?
and and CUtler, at the mouth of the
fr.-T, reported that no strange craft
had been seen.
The demolished building wai owned
by Carroll Dennison, of this village,
and was used as a fiih itand for a short
time each year in catching alewlvei.
It was built in the middle of the river.
The owner said he had not visited thc
rlace for severai months and had no
knowledge that anything waa stored
there.

In the face of furioua eoanter

French made no attempt to extend
