One Closely Connected With

" Would Not Consider Plan .
Rumors continue to be heard tbat
Hawaiian Pineapple Company may be
secured by the big canning merger
recently perfected on the Pacific
coast and which Inclades the Pine
apple Preserving Company of this ter
ritory as a subsidiary of one of its
companies which went to make up the
new corporation. These rumors are
receiving credences in some circles
here and the strength of Pineapple
stock on' the local exchange Is credit
fd to such reports by some of these
leople.
Before the organization of the new
big canning corporation in California
It was reported on the mainland the
H Julian Pineapple, Company was to
be included. Manager Dole at tnat
time refused to confirm or deny the
report.. Later the merger was formed
without including Hawaiian Pineapple
Company; the Dew company was in
corporated, its stock distributed,- and
it is now regularly selling in the San
-'Francisco market
; But despite the apparent end of the
matter through the formation of the
company come new rumors, this time
to -the effect that the big company is
still peeking Hawaiian companies' or
at least erne Hawaii company, if it can.
be iecured at the price desired. This
price the reports do not mention. It
is said that James D. Dole does not
deny having heard such reports. -. On
the other hand a man prominently con
nectPl w ith the local company . said
that it Is not considering entering the
merger, that its directors are well sat
isfied with -tLo-Axi-j 'iI.oiVcre'ESfng
. I'nder prercr.t arrangements,.- .and
riu.'iot sec nhfe try-, benefit to stock
holder;! here would rfEulL.
Original reports I rem -"the;-, coast,
which . included , Hawaiian Pineapple
In the original merger as proposed,
placed the prjee at which" the stock
wan to be taken at $30 and the stock
in now quoted on' the local exchange at
$S2 to S5S: . 1
Whether negotiations are under way
w ith some of the larger shareholders
for their interest has not been learned
nor is it possible to determine wheth
er purchases in the market were made
for merger Interests. The capital of
the company is $700,000 and at pres
ent market quotations it would require
$1,600,000 to acquire all of the stock.
SAYS GUY CF
Former Postmaster at Pauwela,
Maut Sentenced Monday;
Shortage is $817.20
kelson K. Kaloa, former postmaster
atiftuwela. Maul, pleaded guilty In
the federal court today to an Indict
ment charging him with having con
verted to his use certain postal fund
amounting to $8X7.20. : He appeared In
court without an attorney, 6aying that
be desired to plead guilty and that he
was ready to be sentenced. ; .
Federal Judge Horace W. Vaughan
will sen tense the defendant at 10
o'clock next Monday morning. The
iudlctment alleges that the embexrle
roent of the postal funds occurred on
September 20, this year. The case
was first brought to the attention cf
the federal authorities, following a
personal investigation by Postofficc
Inspector Thomas J. Flavin. Kaloa
is said to have recently confessed the
misappropriation to the U. S. attor
ne; "paying that he used some of the
raoATy himself and loaned the rest to
his friends. -'. "
DR. AND MRS. JUDD v
LANDED SAFELY IN U. S.
Dr. J. R Judd fend Mrs. Judd. on
their way home from the French battle-front,
landed in New York today.
Fhelr arrival removed some worry
from the minds of relatives .' and
friends, who had been all the more
anxious since the French liner Lafay
ette, on which the surgeon and his
wife took passage, was a day overdue.
It is considered probable that the
Lafayette went out of the customary
steamer paths and changed her steam
ing time to avoid possibility of meet-ing-the
German submarine U-53 or the
other submerslbles operating 'off the
Atlantic coast. - The two words by
wireless to -A, F.- Judd. "Landed.
Judd," came as a relief. - ',-..
