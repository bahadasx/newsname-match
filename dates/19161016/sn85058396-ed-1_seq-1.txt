I Unrelenting Drive Being
Kept up on Somme Front
if
Teutonic pressure against the Ru
I maniun along the Transylvania fron
I tier continues unabated, according to
the latest official reports, and, at one
point at least, King Ferdinand's
forces have been driven back -well
within their own territory.
This crucial point for the Ruma
nians lies southwest of Kronstadt in
the southern reaches of tho Torzbur
ger pass, where thoy are making a
determined stand at Rucaru, some
j seven miles south of the border. The
I Teutonic thrust here is aimed in the
J direction of Bucharest, which lies 75
J miles across the Rumanian plain from
1 its cdgo at Ganpuling, ten miles south-
west of Rucam.
On the Somme front in northern
France, the entente forces are keep-
ing up their unrelenting drive.
1 The French last night, after having
I checked counter attacks against their
I positions won last Sunday in their
pocketing campaign around Chaulnes,
I resumed the offensive north of the riv

succeeded in penetrating German po
I sitions at Sailly-Saillisel, pushing up

Rumanians Meet Defeats.
London, Oct 16, 3:10 a, m. The sit
uatlon on tho Rumanian frontier oc
cupies the leading position on the
news and editorial pages of the Lon
don newspapers. The Rumanians ac
cording to the latest official state
ments, have been forced back six or
seven miles at one point into their
own country. They are making a
stand at Racaru, which is a small
town toward the southern end of the
Torzburger pass. At Racaru the Aus-tro-Germans
are well below the high
est level of the pass. South of this
town the road runs ten miles through
a rolling country to the railhead of
Campulung, which is practically on
the edge of the Rumanian plain and
75 miles from Bucharest?
The Times notes: 'The enemy has
advanced into Rumania through the
Torzburger pass and the Rumanians
are fighting on their own soil at
Racaru. Apparently they nave tem
porarily lost possession of all but the
southern approaches of Torzburger
pass. Further north the enemy pene
trated to the crest of Citoz pass but
was then driven back in a fierce en
counter. In the other passes tho en
emy Is making no progress but until
effective help reaches the Rumanian
second army we must expect varyiug
fortunes in this district."
British Meet Repulse.
Berlin, Oct 16, via London. British
troops yesterday attacked the Ger
man positions northeast of Guede
court, three miles south of Bapaume,
and penetrated the German first line
but the ground was recaptured after
a counter attack, says the official
statement issued today by the German
headquarters staff.
French troops made an attack on
the German positions west of the
town of Sailly-Saillisel, the German
statement adds. The attackers were
driven back south of the village by
a counter attack.
RUMANIAN ARMY
IS ANNIHILATED
Berlin Reports Fearful Loss of
Enemy Forces in Transyl
vanian District.
Berlin, Oct. 16. Via wireless to
Sayville. The Rumanian Second
army in its retreat in Transylvania
lost approximately two divisions, says
the Overseas News Agency. "The Ru
manian First Army and the larger
part of the Second army have been
virtually annihilated.
"When the successful attack was
made on the first army al Herman
stadt by the Austro-German troops,
the Rumanians planned to send the
second army to its assistance. This
plan was learned from reports of
aviators. The Second army was too
far to the west and was forced to
retreat In haste. Its retreat became
a panicky flight. On October 13 iso
lated detachments were still being
rounded, up. Captured officers say
the army was completely disorgan
ized. It would have been annihilated
if Rumanian forces had not been hur
ried in through the Torzborger and
Predeal passes.
Leaders Lose Direction.
"Tho Rumanian leaders lost their
surety of direction. Brigades and
regiments in desperation were moved
hastily forward and back on railroads
and even on carts. Only pitiful frag
ments of the army could be rescued
from Transylvania.
"Transylvania today is clear of the
Rumanians, oxcept for small sections
near the border. At the same time
the Rumanians hope of obtaining as
sistance from the people of Transyl
vania have been frustrated. The en
tiro Transylvania ropulatlon and the
bettor Rumanian element feel they
have been delivered from a night
marc, as tho Rumanians have been
expelled after a short reign of terror."

DESPERATE FIGHT
ON SOMME FRONT
British Take Prisoner Every
Yard of Advance Germans
Hold to Last.
BATTLE UNCEASING
Heavy Resistance Met in Face
of Furious Attacks Past
Week Quiet.
(Copyright 1916 by the Associated
Press.)
British Front in France, Sunday,
Oct. 15, via London, Oct. 16, 12:40
a. m. In completing the capture of
Schwaben redoubt, on the ridgo above
Thiepval, the British took a prisoner
for every yard of front, or 2S0 for a
front of less than 300 yards, not to
mention the number killed by the
artillery preparation in hand-to-hand
fighting, before the survivors sur
rendered. The Germans manning the
trench and those in the reservo dug
outs could hardly have been crowded
into one line back of the parapet.
This gives an idea of the importance
the Germans attached to that last bit
of high ground along their old trench
lines south of the Ancre on the
Thiepval ridge, which their desperate
resistance characterized as the most
precious two acre plot in all France.
After the British got the first half
of the redoubt, the Germans made re
peated counter attacks to recover pos
session of it, and for the last week
there has been no cessation of the
fighting. Now the British look down
all along the valley to Grandecourt
and it is impossible apparently for
the Germans to maintain batteries in
that area.
Germans Stick to Trenches.
Between the new British positions
and the river along tho old front line
fortifications German infantry, com
manded by British guns from two
sides, still stick to their maze of
trenches, going and coming like wood
chucks through their underground gal
leries. A German prisoner reports
that in this neighborhood there is a
record size dugout capable of holding
2500 men.
"They do hate to leave their happy
homes, which they have been two
years building," said a British sol
dier. The big ijarrisons which the Ger
mans maintain for tho most part,
keep their dugouts, rushing out when
there is any recess in the shell fire
to try to repair the damage done.
When they are observed, the British
guns let loose on them. Finally,
when nothing but wreckage of
trenches remains and only the dug
outs are Intact, British infantry
charges to gain another section of
ground.
In taking the remaining uncaptured
portion of Stuff redoubt in the same
region, the British took 100 prisoners
with a loss of 35 men.
Along the center of the battle line
the British have made some attacks
in the last week, though not in grgeat
strength. They succeeded in some
places and failed in others against tho
heavy German resistance. On the
whole, it was the quietest week since
the beginning of the grand offensive.

HUGHES TALKS
TO THEFARMERS
Democratic Administration
Has Ignored Agricultural-Interests
of the Country.

Peace With Honor De
cries Underwood Bill.
Hastings, Nebr., Oct 16. Charles
E. Hughes today told a crowd of farm
ers here that the Democratic admin
istration had ignored the agricultural
interests of the country In urging the
enactment of the Adamson law. The
nominee in support of his contention
cited a telegram from President H. N.
Pope, of the Texas Farmers' union,
to President Wilson requesting that
the farmers be permitted to submit
data in arbitration proceedings be
tween the railroads and the brother
hoods. Mr. Hughes also referred to "invis
ible government."
"Let me say this," the nominee de
clared, "those who are declaiming to
the American public invisible govern
ment had better remember that when
I was in executive responsibility in
the state of New York there was no
invisible government in that state.
Farmers Are Ignored.
"I want to say in reference to this
that it seems to me that tho farm
ers of tho country were very little
considered the other day when on
the demand of the administration the
wages of a group of railroad workers
were Increased by law, In response to
force. Somebody has got to pay the
increased bills and the farmers will
know very quickly who has to pay
them.
"The farmers were not represented
in this discussion if you may call it
that, in this surrender. I have hero
la copy of a telegram that was sent
to the president by Mr. Pope, presi
dent of the State Farmers' Union of
Texas, which I shall read to you.
" 'We ask that you make no con
cessions or commitments that will
In any manner cause an Increase in
freight rates on products produced or
consumed on the farm. Tho men who
pay tho freight have anequity in this
dispute which "neither th railroad'
trainmen, nor the railroad managers,
have authority to represent If It is
your intention to personally dispose
of the matter, we ask that you further
postpone decision of the subject until
a committee of the farmers can pre
pare information and data regarding
their side of the case. If you decide
to settle by arbitration then the
farmers should have representation of
any arbitration committee that may
be formed to dispose of this question,
for the men who pay should Have rep
resentation as well as the men who
receive it We again urge that all
questions involved, be settled by arbi
tration where all parties and all in
terests can be heard and the sub
ject dealt with aside from haste and
Intimidation.' "
The crowd cheered when Mr.
Hughes concluded reading the tele
gram. "No regard was paid to that mes
sage," Mr. Hughes said.
"The business men of the country,
through the Chamber of Commerce
of the United States were at the
same time, and had for several weeks
before, been imploring the executive
and leaders in congress for an im
mediate and prompt inquiry In order
that the justice of this matter might
be known. The farmers were not
there, except through the presence of
the representatives of the people In
congress; and those representatives
were asked to abdicate their author
ity and the executive instead of stand
ing for the official and moral power
of the American people, when a great
fundamental principle of our institu
tions was Involved, threw up his
hand, gave up tho principle of free
dom and went Into congress demand

sary to pay tho bill.
No Regard for Justice.

Case of Holland Simplest
Spain's Grievances to Be

NORWEGIANS NEUTRAL
Treatment of Submarines by
United States Highly Satis
factory to German
Official.
Berlin, Sunday, Oct. 15. Via Lon
don, Oct 16, 12:30 p. m. Norway,
Holland and Spain are now playing
the leading parts in Germany's intor
1 national submarine problem to the
subordination of the United States,
which so long and so often has held
tho center of the stage. Tho Asso
ciated Press correspondent discussed
the present situation today with Dr.
Alfred Zlmmermann, under-secretary
for foreign affairs, who indicated that
the tables had been cleared, and that
no negotiations were in progress as
far as the United States was con
cerned. Ho outlined developments re
garding other neutrals.
The case of Holland is simplest. It
concerns only the Bloomersdljk,
which was sunk off the New England
coast by the German submarine U-53.
Germany is unwilling to accept the
cabled version of the circumstances
under which the Bloomersdijk was
sunk and is convinced the submarine
commander must have kept within
the German prize regulations, as
strictly enjoined. Full compensation
has been offered, In event the com
mander exceeded his Instructions.
Spain's Grievances.
Spain's grievances have to do with
the sinking of fruit steamers. Strict
ly speaking, these are valid prizes be
cause the cargo is contraband, bound
for hostile ports. The Spanish gov
ernment, however, has pointed out
that the prosperity of the country anu
particularly of the great class of
small fruit growers, has been affect
ed seriously by interruptions of this
trade, and -Germany has offered to let
such ships pass unmolested If they are
provided with proper certificates
from German consuls and if the en
tente allies permit similar cargoes
ship for ship to pass for the German
market No reply has been received.
Norwegian Measure Unneutral.
The Norwegian measures barring
submarines from Norwegian waters
in accordance with the British memor
andum Is regarded as incompatible
with Norwegian neutrality. No ex
haustive report on tho legal aspects
of the question has a yet reached Dr.
ZImmermann's hands, but the under
secretary said the matter undoubtedly
would be the subject of a strong pro
test to Norway. He took the position
that Norway was unjustified under
international law in differentiating
among classes of warships and mak
ing rules npplylng to one specific
class.
U. S. Attitude Praised.
Dr. Zlmmermann spoke with high
est satisfaction of the terms of Ameri
ca's reply to tho memorandum of the
entente allies on tho treatment of
submarines. He declared It was
marked by a true spirit of neutrality.
Tho appearance and activity of a
German submarine off the American
coast had not been made the subject
of diplomatic negotiations or compli
cations, he continued, and all reports
indicated that the German command
er had observed in every way the
leter and spirit of Germany's under
takings with the United Stites. He
said no communications on that sub
ject had been received either through
the German embassy at Washington
or through the American embassy

SUNDAY PAPERS I
TOBEREDUCED I
Letter Sent by Federal Trade H
Commission Asking Pub
j lishers to Conserve
Paper. )
Washington, Oct. 15. Reduction in
tho size of Sunday newspapers as a
means of conserving the news print
paper supply of the country and pos- jH
slbly preventing the suspension of
smaller newspapers, was recommend- '
ed in a letter sent today by the Fed- IH
eral Trade Commission to all the
publishers of large Sunday newspa
pers in the United States.
The letter follows:
"In connection with its investiga
tlon of news print prices, the commls
sion has given serious consideration
to possible means of preventing tho
suspension of papers because of the
increasing scarcity and advancing
prices. The present situation can
only be alleviated by Increasing the 1
output or reducing consumption.
"Tho commission has conferred
with a number of prominent publish- jH
ers regarding ways to reduce con
sumption in addition to the cutting
off of returns, eliminating wastes,
etc., which many newspapers are re
ported to have already done. These
publishers are of the opinion that IH
there Is still an opportunity to effect tM
a considerable reduction in consump- H
tlon by cutting down the size of Sun
dav newspapers. They feel that the
elimination of certain features would .
meet with public approval and would
not decrease the revenues of the pub
lishers. "The paper saved by cutting down
the size of one large Sunday edition
several pages will be sufficient to
keep a number of smaller papers sup
plied for a considerable time, unless
present supplies of paper can be in
creased, which does not now seem
probable, such unselfish action on the
part of the large city papers, appear.-
to bo tho only means that will havo
many of the smaller publishers from
going out of business.
"The commission asks your co-op-eration
in this mater, and would liko
to know your attitude toward this
proposition. The commission would
also appreciate any suggestions that
occur to you regarding practical ways
of making this proposal effective."
