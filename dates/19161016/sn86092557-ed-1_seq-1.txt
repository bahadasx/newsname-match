Washington, d. c., Oct. 16.?
, Ths Hon. Taylor Vinson, of Hunting'i
ton, baa at last succesded is getting
/ oat of the Republican party, according
to the view of It taken here, and It
I appears to give much satisfaction to
T' those Republicans who hold to that
lew. He has zealously knifed every I
i Candida to for governor nominated by
the Republican party, since ho Join[
ed that organization about the year
1900, they say. Usually, he has fought
' . under cover, being much better qualified
for guerilla warfare than for a
struggle In the open. If their tale bo
\ correst. By keeping in the background
'/ and pretending to be for the ticket.
I he has enable to render most efficient
/ service to tbe opposition to the Republican
party. By personal sllicltation
" he could thus direct his few friends
and control them In voting tor tbe
oposltlon candidates, and by apparI
antly being in favor of tbe Republican
B.V candidate, he thereby drove a much
larger number of Republicans to support
the opposition in tbe hope that
they were thereby expressing their
, disapproval of Vinson and his methods
He, in fact, got them both going
! and coming, they say.
in lue prVBCUl UbUh UUKCIDI, uo
l has not only climbed on the top of
the fence, but over into the Democratic
pasture field, his Washington critics
say. It Is not the fact of his
[ going, or that he haB gone, that interests
them, but the purllo reasons
. v which he bas given for making the
Journey. In a movemont engineered
\ by him, and fathered by his friend,
* Ukiarcnm, which culminated in the pub,
location of letters from Vinson, Har'
cum. Grant P. Hall. T. E. Houston.
J William McKell and A. A. Lilly, erstwhile
"Honest Abe," the public is
handed the reasons why Vlncon and j
his immediate following cannot sup-j
port Judge Ira E Robinson
i Marcum outlines what he alleges to i
" be the terms of an agreement reached
' between Judge Robinson on one band
3 and the "sore six" on the other. It
divides the thing into seven sections,
t>r, If we follow the printer's methods
| In subdividing the Bible, "one chapter"
composed of seven "verses," containing
all of the terms of this alleged
agreement, and submits the same to
Hall, Houston, Mcell. Vinson and Lilly,
and each one In substance writes
a letter to the yearning Marcum. and
t says "Me too."
One of the funny things that will
strike tho man who looks beneath the I
surface in order to know what is really
transpiring, Is the fact that Mar- >
i. cum who was not present, was enabled
, to tell eacb person present at the alleged
conference retail of what trans-:
- pored. Could It be possible that Taylor
Vinson wrote this chapter and1
?- merely Induced Marcum to play a sort
of stepfather to it. and Hlgn his name?
West Virginians here aro asking.

this world. It is here, fully grown.
* . and ready to be tested for all voteg
getting purposes, for the Democratic
party; it should be taken Into tbe fold
and worked to the limit. Let us look
i It over for a little while and see, if
\ possible, what the Watson combination
have really received for their
. money:
1 The first verse provides that Rob1
Inson was to publish a card of thanks
thanking Lilly and Lilly's supporters,
1 and promising that they should receive
the same consideration at the Judge's
I hands as his own friends. This card
\ has certainly gone forth to the public,
i decorated like a high school girl's diploma,
with a red ribbon, and we know
of no supporter of "Honest Abe" who
now claims he is short on thanks from
> Jndge Robinson, unless the members
. of the "Vinson Quintette" feel that the
~ same have not been banded to them
; In acordance with their great deserts.

v Insists from the stump that he will

DDE LAW
Tells Baptists that Much
Good Has Been
Done.
(Special Dlspntrh to West Virginian)
LOGAN, Oct. 16.?The enactment
of amendments to the Yost Prohibition
law which would make it unlawful
for Intoxicating liquors even to be
transported from one point to another
within the state of West Virginia ?-?i
make it the duty of municipal officers
to enforce the state law whether the
municipality has an ordinance on the
subject or not, were advocating by
Fred O. Blue, state prohibition commissioner
In his report on Temperance
submitted tonight to the Baptist
General Association of West Virginia
now In session here. The report in
part follows:
"First: The benefits of state-wide
prohibition have manifested themselves
In many ways since the state
became dry, viz., the first day of July,
1914. Savings accounts have largely
increased atul the deposits in state and
National banks show an increase of
more than $G,00U,00(l as compared
with amounts on deposit on tlie thlr
lietb day of June, IS) 14. 26,000 thousand
more men are employed in Industries
of the state today than were employed
therein on June au, 1914. The
uurabcr of arrests for drunkenness, us
shown by the records of the police
counts, has decreased at least 60 per
cent since July 1, 1914. Upon the authority
of Dr. L. V. Guthrie, superintendent
of the Huntington State Hospital,
there has been a decrease of TS
per cent In tlie cases of alcoholic insanity
coming under his observation.
"On Aug. 1. 1914, there -were 1.620
prisoners in the state penitentiary ol
Moundsville. On Sept 20, the number
of prisoners in that institution was
1.00S, a decrease of 252. Warden
White of that institution ha3 made the
statement that he will not be surprised
it the number of prisoners in the state
penitentiary do not exceed 800 by Jan.
,1 1917.
"Second: When the prohibition law
of 1918 was enacted, such law was regarded
as the most advanced of any
prohibition legislation at that time,
indeed It was pronounced by many as
too drastic. Much of the opposition
to the drastic provisions of that law
has passod away, and today thero is
a strong demand throughout the state
for the law to be amended so as to
make it more drastic.
"Third: Just as long as the peo
pie of a 'dry' state take an Interest
in the prohibition Taws of tho 'dry'
state, the law will be enforced. Many
good and many well-meaning p
may bo under the Impression that
when a state votes 'dry', the fight is
over. The fact is the fight has then
begun. It is the work of the church
to carry forward the work of education
and of agitation so that the inter
est of the people in prou.omon laws
may not lag and thai those who demand
that the right shall oe left to
them to receive intoxicating liquors
without restraint may appreciate their
duty and their obligation to society as
well as to thr -to Is not strong
enough himself to resist bis habit nor
to reals the disposition to be a lawbreaker.
inereior;, oe it reeoivea:
1. That the denomination pledges Itself
to aid and assist In the work ol
law enforcement.
3. That It pledges Itself to aid and
assist In the great work of education
and maintaining public sentiment for
the perfecting of legislation, the enforcement
of law and the making ol
the state a model 'dry' state.
3 That the denomination favors and
demands the following amendments to
the present law:

Scarcity of Labor at the

, Hard Coal of Stone Sizes
Likely to Go to Nine Dollars
by Christmas.
f By Associated Press)
NEW YORK, Oct. K..?A shortage of
coal Is In prospect for this city this
winter according to the dealers who
declared their bins are depleted, their
shipments delayed and that the outlook
for immediate or eventual release
is poor. The shortage applies to both
bard and soft coal.
Failure to receive the usual amount
of coal is attributed to scarcity of labor
at the mines and lack of cars for
transportation, the latter of which is
safl to'be m?st serious, due to the
movement of war munitions and other
freight for export. The enormous foreign
trade is also blamed for the ;
shortage, which, it is stated, exists in j
other sections of the country as well
as here.
Prices to New York house-holders
for stove and nut coal vary from |7
to (7.75 cents. Dealers declare that
with seasonable weather the price will
reach (8 before Thanksgiving and
that $9 coal is not too high to expect
at Christmas.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 1(J?'The supreme
court today refused to review
the conviction of four labor leaders in
the 1913 coal strike at Colliers, W. Va.
who were sentenced to six months In
prison for contempt of court in falling
to obey an injunction issued by
a federal district judge.
The cases are another outcrop of
litigation in connection with Judge
Daytons decree that the United Mine
Workers was an unlawful conspiracy
in Its organization and operation. The
defendants were members of the union
; and were found guilty of Inciting minors
to leave or refuse employment.
Their conviction was affirmed by the
fourth federal circuit court of appeals
on the theory that Judge Dayton's decree
against the United Mine Workers
was valid.
The case is set for argument before
the supreme court during present
term. The four leaders were Fanny
Sullens, Frank Lcdvinka. James Oates
and Hiram Stephens.

BUSY SESSION FOR
OCTOBER COURT
Thirtyone Bootleggers Have

Vincent.
The October term of the Intermediate
court begins tomorrow with
miny one Doonegger nppeal case^'
on the docket. These are less than!
halt of the state cases that are to be!
heard, the total being 114. Many of]
these misdemeanor charges have been
continued on the docket from one
cause or another for more than a year.
The jurors who were drawn more than j
a month ago will appear tomorrow ami
it Is likely that after the docket Is
readand revised for trial, that the
work of hearing these state cases will
be begun at once by Judge Vincent.
The state cases however, are but a
small portion of the vast amount of
business that baa accumulated tor
this busy court. There aro at present
75 luw cases to be heard of which 4S
are appeals from justices' courts.
Many of these law cases will require
a jury for trial and will likely be
taken up before the chancery docket
Is considered. On the chancery docket
are 85 old cases that have been carried
over until tills term and 12 newcases
that were Sled during October

Old Excuse of Moulting
Hens is Only One
Offered.
In Fairmont eggs were being retailed
at 39 and 40 cents on Saturday anil
thin morning the price had Jumped to
43 and 4C cents, only one or two exceptions
were there who still held to
the old 40 cent price, in New York
ctlv eggs nnve jumped from 30 cents
to G3 and it is predicted the price will
reach the dollar mark Inside of two
weeks. Consumers are now wanting
to know why? (
"The hens are moulting and naturally
are not laying. People want eggs
and are' willing to pay for them. So
there you are," was one explanation.
The man in charge of a car load of
eggs from the Armour packing company,
in the city today, said:
"My company has not yet told mo
of any advance in price, but 1 may get
word to raise the price at any time.
1 think the scarcity and result in that
increase in price is due to the fact
that since eggs are scarce, all the big
egg dealers are trying to buy enough
to protect their markets, and to get
them they are hnving to pay fancy
prices. Of course such action affects
the entire trade."
