Hines Farmers' Glub Passes Resolu

Townsman.
APPLAUDED FOR STAND
TAKEN AGAINST BONDS
Hines to Have a Creamery Reported
that Bank Will Be Organized
Also.
(By Staff Correspondent)
Mines, Minn., Oct. 16.-r-Home folks
.gave their townsman, "Dynamite
Charley" Carter, candidate for legis
lature from this district, a big sendoff
Saturday night at a meeting of the
Hines Farmers' club.
They unanimously passed a reso
lution endorsing his candidacy and
all pledged their support to their fel
,low townsman.
For Woman's Suffrage.
Mr. Carter delivered an address
outlining his candidacy and his
neighbors vigorously applauded his
condemning of too many ditches and
bonds, the inflating of valuations,
etc. He renewed his promises made
in his keynote address at Tenstrike
and expressed himself in favor of
"woman's suffrage."
"I am in favor of woman's suffrage
because I believe that women can use
the vote for the protection of and
sanctity of the home," he said.
Mr. Carter got his name, "Dyna
mite Charley," several years ago
when he advocated the state selling
dynamite to homesteaders to clear
lands. The old name was revived
when he announced his platform as
"Stop ditching and blow more
^stumps."
School is Crowded.
The farmers' meeting Saturday
night brought many farmers and
their families to the school house.
The school room was crowded and all
took much interest in the meeting.
A. B. Page, president of the club,
presided at the meeting.
Initial steps were taken for the
construction of a creamery. Two
hundred dollars and a site have al
ready been pledged and it is believed
that the new creamery will be con
structed in a short time. Hines is a
good location for a creamery, there
being 50 more or less farmers liv
ing in the near neighborhood of the
settlement. It is a prosperous little
settlement. Besides being on the
Minnesota & International railway,
it is located at the "cross-roads" of
six good roads from that many dif
ferent points. Hines is one of the
-only settlements in this district that
has never had a saloon and the class
of people found near her are steady
and progressive. Hines is growing
.and it is reported that plans are be
ing made for the organization of a
bank.
New Buildings.
New buildings are also being con
structed. V. M. Owens has con
structed a 32x50, full basement, two
story building which will be com
pleted next week. The first floor will
be used for the store and the second
floor will be for living rooms. Other
new buildings have also been planned
for Hines. Charles S. Carter, candi
date for legislature, has a large store
and a beautiful home.
At the meeting Saturday night tele
phone improvements, road improve
ments, taxes and other matters of
general interest were discussed.
I. W. Langard of Blackduck in an
address spoke on national issues and
endorsed the candidacy of Carter for
the legislature.
S. W. Ellis, county commissioner of
the fifth district, against the present
commissioner, J. .C Thompson of
Blackduck, stated that he was for
rigid economy in couniy affairs and
was opposed to the digging of ditches
in the big muskegs.
An excellent program of music was
given. Lunch was served.

SHARP WORDS FROM
REPUBLICAN CHIEFS
Charles E. Hughes in an ad
dress at Lincoln., Neb., Satur
day, said: "I believe in peace
in peace maintained with
honor. I believe in peace
that is maintained with self
respect. I believe in peace
in a world where we desire
the friendship of this nation,
a peace which recognizes and
maintains the dignity of Am
erican citizenship. Tha is.
the right course of prosperity
and civility. It is a great
mistake to depart from it."
Colonel Theodore Roosevelt
in an address at Wilkesbarre,
Pa., Saturday, said: "I cham
pion Mr. Hughes against Mr.
Wilson, because in every such
crisis Mr. Wilson, by his
public acts, has shown that
he will yield to fear, that he
will not yield to justice
whereas the public acts of Mr.
Hughes has proven him to be
incapable of yielding in any
such a crisis to any threat,
whether made by politicians,
corporations or labor lead-
ers."

Discuss Flans.
Work of conducting the campaign

that he will carry Beltrami county.
The county will undoubtedly give a
big vote to Governor Burnquist for
re-election and Harold Knutson for
congress.
Much Interest Shown.
"Reports from various parts of
the county point toward a certain
Burnquist election as well as that of
Harold Knutson for congress and
Hughes for president," said E. H.
Denu, secretary of the committee.
"Men who have never before taken
an interest in politics are now show
ing a decided interest. If Hughes en
thusiasm did have a let-up, it has
been overcome by the new spirit en
tering the game and Democrats who
early predicted a Wilsbrt'Victory' nlw
admit that the country may go for
Hughes."

the fact that Hughes is gaining votes
every day.

leading Bemidji Democrat this morn
ing.
