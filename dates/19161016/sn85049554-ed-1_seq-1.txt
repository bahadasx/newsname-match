This gives an idea of the Importance

the Germans, which their desperate re
sistance characterized as the most
precious two-acre lot in ail of France.
After the British got the first half of
the redoubt the Germans made repeat

has been no cessation in the flghting.

He Presents History of Adamson Lsw
Hastings, Oct. IB—Charles E. Hughes
today told a crowd of farmers here
that the democratic administration
had ignored the agricultural Interests
of the country In urging the enactment
of the Adamson law. The nominee
cited a telegram from President H. M.
Pope, of the Texas Farmers' Union, to
President Wilson requesting that the
farmers be permitted to submit data in
arbitration proceedings between the
railroads and the brotherhoods.
"I want to say In reference to rights,
that It seems to me that the farmers
of the country were very little consid
ered, when on the demand of the ad
ministration the wages of railway
workers were increased in response to
demands of force," said Mr. Hughes,
"Somebody has to pay the increased
bills and the farmers will know very
quickly who has to pay them.
Farmers Not Represented.
"The farmers were not represented
'n their conference. I have here a copy
of a telegram that was sent to the
president by Mr. Pope, president of
the farmers' union of Texas, which I
will read:
'We ask that you make no conces
sions or commitments which in any
manner cause increased freight rates,'
says Mr. Pope's telegram. 'The men
who pay the freight have an equity In
this dispute which neither the railroad
trainmen nor the managers have au
thority to represent. If it is your in
tention personally to dispose of this
matter, we ask you to postpone action
until a committee of farmers can pre
sent their side of the case. If you
conclude to settle by arbitration, then
the organized farmers should have
representation on any committee that
may be formed to dispose of this ques
tion, for the men who pay should have
representation
"tn. well as the men who
receive. We again urge that all quas*
turn* tovrtved^fevsattlcp hy^WbfttatfEoa.
.where all parties 'involved can be
heard.'" -,
Message Disregarded.
The crowd cheered when Mr. Hughes
concluded the reading of the telegram.
"tfo regard was paid to that mes
sage,". Mr. Hughes said, "The business
men of the country, thru the chamber
it commerce of the United States,
were at the same time and had for
many weeks before been imploring* the
executive and congres^ .for an
Immediate and prompt inquiry In order
that the justice of this matter might
be shown. The farmers were not there
except the representatives of the people
in oongress and those representatives
were asked to abdicate their authority
and the executive, Instead of standing
for the official and moral powers of the
American people, threw up his hands,
gave up the principle of arbitration
and went into congreek demanding an
increase by law, without Inquiry or
knowledge of its Justice, of wages
amounting 'to millions of dollars, sug
gesting that there would be an in
ciease of freight rates if necessary to
pay the bill.
"I am opposed to that sort of gov
ernment. It Is not a,government whloh
has any regard for the just interests
of communities such as this. I am in
favor of everything that can reason
ably be done for the promotion of agri
culture.
Body Blow to Agriculturists.
"But it is idle to talk of interests of
the farmer when you have action like
this taken In oongress, over night,
against the protests of the farmers,
and dealing a body blow at the Inter
ests of our agricultural communities.
"It also is Idle to speak of special
isiterest in the farmer when we have
the policy of the administration out
lined In such a bill as the Underwood
bill."
Mr. Hughes again denied the decla
ration that a vote for him meant "a
vote for war."
"The farmers of this country always
have been patriotic In sentiment," he
said. "We have~ never had a national
difficulty where we did not have the
boys responding from our farms. I do
not believe there is a decadence'in the
spirit of America, but I stand here as
a man of peace, and 1 say It Is an
atrocious misrepresentation for any
one to go thru this land proclaiming to
the American people that a vote for
nie Is a vote for war. What a pre
posterous statement for the interests
cf peace! We desire to pursue the
ideals of peace. We have always stood
up for the national dignity of the
American cltlseh. Are those things
incompatible?. When it Is found that
they are incompatible the American
nation **111 go straight down to dls-1
aster- Tnere Is no such thing as a
lasting peace at the price of self
rospect. of self-eSteem and the confi
dence of other nations. We have no
aggressive pqllcy. We do not seek to
exploit anybqj^\ We do not Invite any
country to'go to *rar. We ask nothing
but our "known 'rights."

PREMIUM ON LARGE FAMILIES.
France Proposes to Encourage Larger
Birth Rsta.
Paris, Oct. 16.—France 2s thorough
ly aroused to the Importance of In
creasing its population following the
great war. It is held that treaties are
not to be relied upon for the mainten
ance of peace, but rather an increased
number of soldiers will be the most
potential deterrent to attack by the na
tion's foes.
To provide this large army larger
families (an increased number of chil
dren) are requisite. The French ideal
of a family is iimiiuu to t,«vc children.
Plans to encourage a much higher
birth rate are now under discussion.
All that had been done to this end
previous to the war was the granting
by law In 1890 of a free scholarship
in one of the colleges to one of seven
children of the same family. It la now
generally admitted that Instead the
first three or four should be encour
aged.
That Is the object of the proposed
law. recently Introduced In the cham
ber of deputies by Paul Benazet, depu
ty for the department of the Indre.
tt provides a permium of 500 franca
($100) for each of the first and second
children, 1,000 francs for the third,
2,000 francs for the fourth, and 1,000
francs for each succeeding child.
This will not be a powerful incen
tive to the rich, but It will be a boon
to the poor. The rich will be reached
In other ways by the force of public
opinion, perhaps, becoming so strong
as to constitute a formidable pressure
perhaps by other proposed fiscal legis
lation discriminating In favor of the
large family.

MINERS' SENTENCES STAND.
United 8tates 8upreme Court Refuse*
to Review Convictions
Washington, Oct. 1^.—The supreme
court today refused to review the con
victions of four labor leaders in the
1913 West Virginia coal strike who
were sentenced to six months impris
onment for contempt of court In fail
ing to obey an Injunction by a federal
district judge.
The cases are another outcrop of
litigation in conjunction with Justice
Dayton's decree that the United Mine
Workers was an unlawful conspiracy.
The defendants were members of the
union and were found guilty of incit
ing miners to leave employment. Their
conviction was affirmed on the theory
that Judge Dayton's decree against the
United Mine Workers was valid. The
case is set for reargument before the
supreme court during the present
term.
GOOD WORD FOR DRUNKARDS.
Prohibition Candidate Says They Often
Are Better Than Others.
Louisville, Ky., Oct 16.—A tribute to
the class of men who beoome drunk
ards was paid by Ira Landrith, tho
prohibition candidate for vice president,
in an address to young women at
Ward-Belmont college in Nashville Just
before the national dry candidates left,
here preparatory to resuming the In
diana campaign.
"Don't Judge the drunkard too harsh
ly," Landrith said. "For one,thing he
never is a tightwad. He who worships
the eagle on the dollar seldom worships
the bottle on the shelf. The mean,
miserly, narrow skinflint doesn't get
drunk.
"The man who becomes a drunkard
likes men: the miser has no social in
stinct. Prohibition of the liquor traffic
will save to us a generation Of men who
would give blessing to their time."

that saved his life.

was visiting the stores, her husband,
it is said,jwent to East Dubuque and
came back intoxicated. He abused his
wife on his return, it Is said, which
