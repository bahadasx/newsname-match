tition for i wAe increase to company
official.
"The old wage scale," Mr Knox said
thi morning "was much larger than
that nf any other electric traction com
pany in the southwest The new cale
will put tis far ahead of any outli
westetn company.
Pionperily Ii a Cause.
"The Oklahoma Railway would have
announced an increase lone ait" hut for
the fact that during the recent years of
.l.n. ........ makmif little mouev.
Then, when prosperity came aaain, we
were forced to spend a area! deal to
put Into shape property which had been
neglected during the hard years."
Mr. Knox declared that the policy of
the company was to keep as many ex
perienced employes as it rotild 'AW
bang on to our 'old men' like grim
death," he said today. "We would rath,
e pay hitther wages to experienced men
than lower wage to tnexprrieitced men.
