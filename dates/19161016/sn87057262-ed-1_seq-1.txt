THEY PAY THE FREIGHT
I H.,
Invisible Government Charge Is An
other Topic Taken up by
^.
Candidate.
[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent.
HASTINGS, Neb., Oct. lfi.—Repub
lican Nominee Hughes today answer
ed President Wilson's strictures as
to the "invisible government" and
the republican party and then struck
emphatically at the democratic ad
ministration's failure to consider
pleas of farmers for consideration
prior to enactment of the Adamson
eight hour law.
He 8poke to an audience of more
than 2,000 people assembled in the
open air on one of the streets near
the station.
"Let me say here," he remarked
with a vigorous gesture, "that those
who are declaiming to the American
public about 'invisible government,'
had better remember that when I was
in executive responsibility in New
York, there was no 'Invisible govern
ment'' in that state."
Hughes' reference to ignoring of
the right of fanners to be heard la
any increase .of wages to railway em
ployes—which waaTTSoSfilTTo" S«
fleeted In Increased freight rates—
-was particularly well received by
bis audience of farmers.
"I wish to say with regard to rates,"
he declared, "that It seems to me the
farmers of the country were very
•little considered the. other day, when,
on the demand of the administration,
the wages of a certain group of rail
way employes were increased by
hasty legislation, on the demand of
force. I do not believe in that kind
of legislation. It la very thoughtless,
to say the least, of the interests of
the great agricultural communities,
such as this, because if you increase
expense of carriers by great increase
in wages, somebody has got to pay
the bill. When you say that railways
will pay the increased expenses, you
have only begun. Railways get mon
ey from the shippers, and the farm
ers will know very quickly who pays
the increased rates, which are paid if
increased expenses are thus put up
on railway companies.
"Now there was a great protest In
time, on behalf of the farmers. They
were not represented in this discus
sion, if you can call it such. They
were not represented in this sur
render, they were on the'outside with
others of the public. I have here a
copy of the. telegram which was sent
to the president by Mr. H. N. Pope,
the president of the state farmers'
union of Texas, who put very briefly
the demand of the fanntrs with re
spect to this matter."

The telegram which Hughes read
in full, asked that "there be no con
cessions or committments that will
in any manner cause an increase in
freight rates on produce produced or
consumed on the farm and urged that
a committee of farmers be permitted
to gather data.
"If you conclude to settle by arbi
tration," the message concluded,
"then the organized farmers should
have representation on any arbitra
tion committee that may be lormed
to dispose of tl\a question, for the
men who pay should have representa
tion as well as the men whd receive
it. We again urge that all questions
involved be settled by arbitration, all

PBNSACOLA, Fla., Oct. 16.—E. J.
Fttdge, prominent Pensacolan, today
pleaded not guilty when arraigned on
the charge of murdering his two
daughters, Tennle, aged eleven, and
Ethel, Seven. The case was set for
hearing Thursday.
The girla were shot to death. The
father said one had killed the other
and then taken her own life. The
state's attorney believes the evidence)
indicating a double murder is strong.
No case ever has stirred Florida as
has that of the Fudge children. Their
dead bodies were found in their home
on the edge of the city late in the
evening of June 17, both victims of a
22 calibre rifle which was found on
the premises.
The body of the younger child was
still warm, tout the other girl had
been dead several hours, apparently. I
Her body was found in a closet, thirty
feet from where her younger sister's
lay. Bruises indicated Tennle had
made a struggle for life. The father
who reported the deaths to the police,
said he had gone home from business
about the middle of the afternoon and
finding the doors locked had hunted
for the children in the neighborhood!
for some time before entering the
house. He sent his small son into the
house first then. Upon arrival of the
police, Fudge produced several notes
purporting to have been written by
the elder daughter saying she had kill
ed Ethel and was going to kill herself.
The family came to this city from
Nashville, Tenn.. a year ago followift#
the sudden death of Mrs. Pudge. Her
life had been Insured with her hus

Mob of Two Thousand* en Took Pair of Negroes From
Jail, Strung Thet^Jp and Burned Their Bodies
[United Press Leased Wire Service]
PADUCAH, Ky., Oct. 16.—Frank Kinley, negro, identified by Mrs. Etta Rose, as the
man who attacked her last Friday, and Jesse Thornhill, negro, who said he would have
done the same thing, were taken from the jail by a mob of 2,000 men today and hanged.
Their bodies were burned.
Entrance to the jail where Kinley was held, was gained by sletiige hammers when the
mob overcame the patrol of police which had been thrown about the plaice to protect the
prisoners.
Judge Reed addressed the mob which guvehima hearing and then went about its work.
Kinley was arrested by Paducah police, ^qitried to keep it a secret, but a crowd soon
formed. ''n'w
A patrol was thrown about the ja^.teE^rders.of Judge Reeid, but the police made little
resistance when they saw that bloodshmPwould follow if they did so. After getting the
prisoners, the mob took them to Mrs. Rose's home for
were taken to the outskirts of thie city. |h»
Rose worked in the Illinois Central sMs and many of the men in the mob were his fel
low workmen who swore vengeance.
v'
The attack occurred when Mrs. Rose refused to give the negro money. He struck her
down with the butt of a revolver.
Kinley was identified by Mrs. Rose as soon as he was arrested, but the mob did not kill
him until she had said a second time that he was the man. Thornhill was picked up on the
way. Ropes were attached to an automobile after being thrown over a limb and the auto
pulled the two into the air. -,

Disagreeing on Eight
Hour Law.
SWINGING INTO LINE
Further Announcements by Other
Railway Men Are Expected to Fol
low Stand by Underwood
and Lovett.
[By Robert J. Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
LONG BRANCH, N. J., Oct 16.—
Statements by F. D. Underwood, pres
ident of the Erie railway, and Robert
S. Lovett, chairman of the board of
the Union Pacific^ railway, endorsing
President Wilson and disputing
claims that tle president acted with
political expediency when he forced
through congress the eight hour law
for railways, is the best news which
has struck Shadow Lawn in soma
days, the president's political lieuten
ants declared today. While the big
railway chiefs disagree with the pres
ident on the eight hour law, lueir
support of the so-called Wilson policy
now under republican fire, is taken
here by leaders, that strong business
interests in ^he country are finally
swinging into line behind the presi
dent. They look for further announce
ment by other leading railway men
similar to those of Underwood and
Lovett.
As a matter of fact Shadow Lawn
bears a very optimistic atmosphere
these days.
Because several business concerns
in the country, notably the Eddicott
and Johnson Shoe manufactory is not
only endorsing, but actually putting
into effect an eight hour day, is held
by the president's advisers as indi
cative that society approves the prin
ciple of the eight hour day as claimed
by the president and that his means
of settling rhe threatened railway
strike are "obviously being vindi
cated."
Party leaders here who two weeks
ago were dubious, today are literally
walking on air. They feel the Blump
has passed and that Hughes will
never be able to catch up again.
Their views are based on scores of
telegrams coming in from their lieu
tenants all over the country—and
contributions amounting to something
like $20,000 a day are material!
boos*irg their optimism. During tae
last five days $160,000 were registered
up in democratic cash registers.
The president this afternoon plan
ned to deliver the first five speeches
he is scheduled to make during the
week. Weather permitting, he will

ITALY IS DETERMINED
Act of Treason for Any of the Allies
to Consent to Peace at
This Time, Says
Bissolatl.
[By John H. Hearley, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
ROME, Oct. 16.—Austria must be
destroyed as a state and Germany
deprived of every thought of domin
ating the world before the war can
end, Signor Bissolatl, civil commis
sioner for war, socialist leader, sol
dier and one of the most powerful
figures in the Italian cabinet, told
the United Press today.
To consent to peace now would be
an act of treason on the part of any
allied nation, he declared.
"J am convinced that War Secre
tary Lloyd-George's statement to the
United Press and Premier Asqulth's
words in the house of commons ex
actly interpret the thoughts and ex
press the firm resolve of all the al
lies," said the Italian cabinet mem
ber.
"The peace to which the whole
world aspires after so many horrors
and sacrifices must be real and last
not a mere truce. Civilization must
safeguard Itself against attempts
similar to the one against which she
Is now reacting with all her strength.
This means that we must create in
Europe such conditions as to render
it Impossible for Germany to resume
her criminal designs.
"I therefore think that any state
or states of the entente who would
today harbor the thought of peace,
would be guilty of an act of treason.
Rather than accept a peace contam
inated by the germ of other wars, it
would have been better not to em
bark on the present war at all.
"The deadly germ of war can
only be killed by destroying Austria
as a state and depriving Germany of
every illusion of predominancy. It is
necessary to proclaim this fearlessly
and openly as Premier Asquith and
Lloyd-George did."

NEW YORK, Oct. 16.—Unharmed,
the French liner LaFayette, with many
notables aboard, docked here today.
She had crossed from Bordeaux,
since last week Sunday while PariB
and the united States feared for her
safety, because of the recent subma
rine warfare off the gateway to Ameri
ca.
The LaFayette, the finest passenger
French ship now afloat, carried 824
persons, including Engco Caruso,
singer, Frank A. Munsey and S. S.
McClure, publishers, Mr. and Mrs.
William K. Vanderbllt, Miss Ann Mor
gan, John Barrett, of the Pan-Ameri
can union, and Gatti^Casazza.
That the LaFayette was unscathed,
caused relief along the water front.
Her safety along with that of the
Hellig Olav reported chased by the
submarine and the arlval of the lin
ers St. Paul and Canopic, were taken
as indicative of a cessation in Ger
man submarine raiding off this coast.
Mariners, however, 1*111. take^ unusual
caution in as much as ttiey believe
that the boats may Still be in the
offing.
The American liner St. Paul took
the precautioh of lighting her Ameri
can markings thoroughly while pass
ing through the raiding zone.
Remembered the Chesapeake.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16.—A super
stition almost aa old as the navy, was
responsible for the United States de
stroyers being prepared for_ action
when they sailed on sudden' ofders
from Newport, Oct. 7. This was ex
plained today at the navy depart
ment, in connection with the publica
tion of a letter from a lieutenant on
the destroyer Benham, telling or this
preparedness.
The navy never has forgotten the
Chesapeake.
The old man of war Chesapeake
sailed from Baltimore in time of
peace in 1807 without making pre
parations for war. With her docks
stored with chicken coops and other
paraphernalia of peace she met a
British man of war that was ready for
battle. The Chesapeake was searched
and turned ignominiously back to
port.
"Since then," it was said, "when
ever a navy vessel goes out on a
cruise it is ready for action."
The fact that the destroyers did not
know when they left Newport what
was going to develop—whether they
might be attacked or whether there
had been violation of this country's
neutrality—was another factor in the
preparedness. They sailed with al
most no notice, knowing only that
merchant and passenger vessels were
being torpedoed, 'a hey did not know
at that time whether they were going
as fighting vessels or as rescue ships.
But they remembered the Chesa
peake.
Insurance Reduced.
LONDON. Oct. 16.—That the Ger
man submarine U-53 either has been
sunk, captured or has returned to a
German port, are the guesses in
shipping circles here to account for
Lloyds' sudden reduction of trans-At
lantic insurance from forty to twenty
shillings. It is assumed here that
Lloyds' action was based on inside in
formation of some sort.
