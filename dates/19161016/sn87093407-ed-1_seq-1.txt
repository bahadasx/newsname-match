Corporation Counsel Caldwell's
resolution, condemning the "certif

measure will be forwarded to

the state by the I-eague of Wash

The league parsed the resolution
at the Kverett meeting Saturday,
after Caldwell had pointed out that
It would endanger the extension ol
municipally owned utilities.
The league also reeolved against
the measure designed to apply the
Kenick law to all city and county
government units.
i Other members of the police de
partment, who are anxious to aee
the dishonest element prosecuted,
point out that "there couldn't be any
better protection for a blind pig
than to buy Its liquor thru the po
lice officer on the beat."
Sergt. V. R. Putnam of the dry
squad believes bootleggers will. In
the future, have their shipment!
routed by way of Montana, instead
of direct, so the cars can be spotted
In Snohomish county. This keeps
the cars out of the jurisdiction of
Seattle and King county officers,
and is unhandy for the Snohomish
officers. It Is not difficult for the
bootleggers to bring the liquor In
