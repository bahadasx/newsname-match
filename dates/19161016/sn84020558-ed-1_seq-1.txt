NOGALES. Ariz., Oct. 15. Arriving
here late this evening after the long
Journey from Tucson in the "safety I
first" car, Oovernor J. H. Kibbey, Joe
V. Prochaska and Judge Otis J. liaughn
were warmly welcomed by a large dele
gation of prominent citizens.
Stops were made at San Xavier,
Twin Buttes and Tujlac during the
afternoon where the candidates me',
many voters, renewed old acquaint
ances and made many new friends. In
view of the fact that these stops were
of considerable length the arrival of
the party in this city was not until
nearly 8 o'clcok this evening.
Everything is in readiness here for
the monster republican rally to be held
tomorrow evening when the candi
dates will address the local voters upon
the issues.
Norman J. McKenzle, republican
candidate for mine inspector, who has
been meeting with exceptional success
during the campaign did not arrive
with the party as he spent the day at
Silver Bell mine near Tucson. He will
arrive here tomorrow in time for the
meeting.
In view of the unusually large audi
ences that have been gathering to
bear Governor Kibbey and the other
candidates on the republican ticket, it
is predicted that the meetings to be
held in the south by campaign party
number one will even exceed the
monster Campbell meetings of sev
eral week g ago.
Never before throughout the south
ern part of the state have there been
so many republicans in evidence. It
seems as though great flocks of them
are coming out from behind every

ST. LOUIS, Oct. 15. Clergymen at
tending the general convention of the
Protestant Episcopal church, in ses
sion here today, occupied all of the
Episcopal pulpits of St. Louis, while
numbers of others preached to congre
gations In neighboring cities.. Scores
of nerxonfi were obliged to stand
through the services at Christ Church
cathedral, a downtown church, where
the Rt. Rev. Charles P. Brent, a bishop
of the Philippines, made a plea for
church unity. t
"Heresies and 'isms." said-he, "be
gan with the separation of a truth from
the truth."
Bishop Brent pleaded for loyalty on
the part of all people to the whole
truth and for a "fearless study of any
truth that may not be prevalent in our
own church."
"It would do us no harm to study
other creeds with a view to adopting
the things worth while for ourselves,"
he added.
Twenty-five thousand dollars in
twenty-five minutes for the estab
lishment of a technical high school at
Sngada, P. I., was subscribed by about
400 persons who remained after the
regular sermon at Bishop Brent's in
vitation. This afternoon a missionary mass
meeting was held at which mission
aries of the church told of their work
in various parts of the world. Tonight
Bishop H. II. Montgomery, secretary
of the Society for the l'ropagation of

preached the triennial mission sermon,
and told of the work of his church in
the mission field.
Bishop Montgomery suggested that
the American church send a deputation
of bishops, priests, laymen and lay
women to England, to aid the church
there in meeting unprecedented prob
lems brought on by the war.
Do you think you could send such
a delegation?" he asked. "Of course I
must get official sanction before I can

sion council of Repentance and Hope

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
VIENNA, Oct. 11. With a keen
longing for peace, has come a persist
ent speculation of the central states, "
as to the manner in which this bless
ing may be secured. But although the
question is but the substance of the
person's own wishes. Political and
military circles today are as far from
seeing a definite plan for the cessation
of the war as they were in the be
ginning. If the fear prevailed in the central
states that a peace with honor, and
possibly profit, could not be secured,
then thought must run in a different
channel. But that the entente has not
shown that it can ultimately realize
its own hopes is the universal view in
Austria-Hungary and Germany and
their allied countries. The offensive
on the Somme, the Russian attack in
Bukowina a,nd in East Galicia, the en
try into the war of Rumania, and its
immediate consequences; the campaign
from Saloniki and the exertions of the
Italians have all contributed toward the
feeling in the central group, that the
resistance met by the entente may yet
open the eyes in those who must first
announce that they will be satisfied
with a peacevhose terms will not have
the dismemberment of central Europe
as a basis.
The central governments; are today
today for a peace which would leave
Europe very much as before the war,
with the exception that Poland must
be made an autonomous state, and that
neither Belgium nor Serbia can again
trouble, innocently or purposely, the
quiet of Europe.
There is here not the faintest indi
cation that the entente is inclined to
enter negotiations on that basis. In
Vienna and in Berlin on the other
hand, nobody can yet see why the cen
tral group should make concessions,
since they claim to hold trumps every
where by the occupation of enemy ter-
ritories so large that the few ad-
viiniages gainea oy me entente can
hardly count. Had the summer opera
tions driven the central troops out of
France and Russia, things would be
different. The Komme offensive has
merely shown, according to the people
here, that the steel wall of the Ger
mans in the west may be bent, but
cannot be broken, while resistance in
the east has been splendid, numbers
considered. The Italians have asain
been obliged to take breath. So long as
the entente cannot convince the pub
lic of the central states, that it is
gaining militarily, the necessity of
making concessions will not break upon
the cental European mind.
It is e"dent that the government and
public are one on this subject. There
is much grumbling about this or that
regulation but all these things are
trifles compared with the great objec
tive that the war must not be lost.
There is no evidence that Russia
would be the first to make peace.
Nevertheless that country is thought
of in this manner. Peace rumors al
ways have Russia In mind. Possibly
this is due to the belief that Russia
is, after all, the most vulnerable of
