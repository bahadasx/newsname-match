SHE'S FOR WILSON
Celebrated Social Worker
Declares for President's

Chicago, Oct.. 10. "I

am going to
That is- the announcement by Miss
Jane Addams of Hull House, called 'by
Theodore Roosevelt "America's great
est citizen,'-'- and the most widely
known social worker in the world, who
arrived in Chicago from a sick, bed
in Maine in order to cast her first prosi
uential vote for Wilson.
Miss Addams was the central woman
figure in the first progressive national
convention in 1M12- Her appearance on
the platform In that memorable gather
ing caused a demonstration lasting
half bu hour and second only to the
demonstration accorded to Colonel
RoOBevelt himself, by his then fellow
Moosers.
"I am too ill to prepare a formal
statement," said Miss Addams today,
"but to the direct question from
friends I have answered that I intend
to vote for Woodrow Wilson. I am too
ill to do any political work."
Thus to the long list of widely known
women supporting President Wilson is
added the name of Miss Addams.
In this list are such names as Mrs.
Ella Flagg Young, former superinten
dent of schools of Chicago, Mrs. An
tonctte Funk, Miss Mary McDowell, di
rector of the Chicago university's so
cial settlement work in the stock yard
district and known as the "Angel of
the Stock Yards," Ida M. Tarbell and a

President's Action in
Settling Strike
By Robert J. Bender.
v (United PreBs staff correspondent.)
.. Long Branch, N. -J.t' Oct.' 10. State
ments by F. D. Underwood, president
of the Erie' railroad, and Robert 8.
Lovett, chairman pf the board of the
Union Pacific railroad; endorsing Presi
dent Wilson aud disputing claims that
the president acted with political expe
diency when he forced through congress
the eight hour day for railroads, is the
best news which has struck Hhadow
Lawn in some days the president's po
litical lieutenants declared today. - ' -While
the big railroad - chiefs dis
agree with the president on the eight
hour law, their support of the so-called
Wilsoa policy now under republican fire
is taken by democratic -leaders here as
a strong indication that the substantial
business- interests of. the country are
finally swingiug- into line behind the
president.- They look for further an
nouncement by other leading railroad
men similar to those of Underwood and
Lovett. ;
As a matter of fact, Bhadow Lawn
bears' a- very otlmbjtie .. atmosphere
these days. Ai-'tton fey several big busi
ness concern in the .country,: notably
the F.ndicott and Johnson, shoe manu
factory, in not only endorsing,' but ac
tually putting into effect an eight hour
day, tir held by the president's advisers
as indicative that society approves the
principle of the eight hoar day as claim
ed by the president and that hi means
of settling the threatened railroad strike
are "obviously being vindicated." c
l'arty leaders here who two weeks ago
were dubious, today are literally walk
inir on air. : They- feel the- slump hits
passed and that "Hughes will never, be,
able to eaten -up again.", . meir views
are based on scores of .-telegrams coming
in from their lietateaaata. all over the
country and contributions amounting
to something like, $20,000 a day are materially-
boosting'their optimism. . Dur
ing the-last five .days $160,000 were
rung up in democratic cash -registers.
Praises Democrats' Work.
Chicago, Oct. 18. President F..D.
Underwood, of' the Erie railroad, is-fur
President Wilson's re-election.- .
Approving the same idea held by
Judge Lovett of the Union Pacific.,. Un
derwood said in. an interview published
today that the democratic party had
"achieved the seemingly impossible and
is worthy of a future trial."
While opposed to Wilson on the eight
hour law, Underwood declared the presi
dent had shown honest motives and he
pointed out that the republicans ako
stand for an eight hour day.
As for tho outlook for prosperity, as
pledged by the republicans, Underwood
said:
"I am not carried away by the state
ments and promises that any political
party on the outs make."
He expressed himself as not holding
the view that Wilson had oppressed big

Nominee Hughes today answered Pres

Hughes' reference to ignoring of the
right of farmers to be hoard in any
increase in wages to- railroad employes
which-was bound to be reflected in
increased freight rates was particular
ly well received by bis audience of far-

Washington, Oct. 10 The case of the

soon placed before the people pf the
United states. The children's bureau of
the labor department is now tabulating
statistical reports from all parts Of the
country, bearing on the problems 'of
illegitimacy and a comprehensive report
will be issued. "It will then be up to
the public," said Mrs. Helen L. Sumner,
assistant chief 'of - the bureau, today-
"Our bureau will make no recommen
dations. It is purely statistical in char
acter.'.'. .''.:.-. . - - -
The statistics will not include the
number- or even the approximate num
ber of illegitimate children in the Unit
ed- States. Such figures are impossible
of attainment, the - bureau has found.
But a great information on. the subject,
designed to make intelligent considera
tion of the question possible, has been
gathered. - - . ... v
While recommendations - for special
legislation are not within the scope of
the bureau, the feeling exists, it is un
derstood that some legislative - action

bestow full '. legal rights on n nameless

New York, Oct. 10. Shipment of mu;

unabated, unless worse submarining Oc
curs off the American gateways than
has occurred to date, marine men said
today.
While they did not discount the pos
sibility of new rnids, the safety of the
giant French liner LaFayettc, the Scandinavian-American
liner Helig Olnv and
tho American liner St. Paul lent
strength to the thought that the raiders
tuny now be streaking homeward.
The LaFayette took the precautions
of dimming her lights through tho ruid
zone, but encountered no enemy.
Weather bureau officials said today
that the possibility of autumn storms
may have driven the U boat or boats to
shelter. From now on marked weather
changes and possibly equally and even
dangerous wsuthcr are likely to occur,
said the bureau, though the worst
storms cenerallv do not hit tho upper
Atlantic until January-
From one of the lending Mritisii lines
come the stntement today that the sub
marine raids have had "not the slight
est effect" upon the munitions traffic,
aside from temporary delays last week

- The addition of this huge force is one

From conversations with Krnpp diree- .

Alelheim and Essen, though. miles sep

the roof knocked off one house near
Essen, but the Krupp establishments
were hot touched." '
The Krupp factories are so enormous
