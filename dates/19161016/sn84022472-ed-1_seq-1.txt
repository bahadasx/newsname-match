The. people of the Ninth district
vole to glad tidings when they re

doorway admitted a letter from Wil

chairman of the district informing
them that the European war will soon
be over. -
To make the measure of his 'bounty

not to fall in love withthe prosperity
which marks life there..
The distinguished f orme alderman

rushed around to stop any more letters

We are confronted at! this time,

Construction Records Show
Bridgeport Had Boom in
September.
Bridgeport building operations for
the month of September far exceed in
number of permits and valuation those
of any other city in Connecticut and
come second -In the list of New Eng
land cities excluding Boston, which is
not included In a list compiled by
Bradstreet's weekly review.
Exceeded in New England by the
city of Worcester only, which shows
aggregate values of $586,550 on 155
permits, Bridgeport shows $547,541 on
203 permits, a relatively greater
amount of construction work.
Hartford issued only.177 permits ag
gregating $246,497. New Haven with
143 permits this month has fallen to
$323,945 against $1,478,499 for the
year 1915. . ' '

The mob formed at the jail here to

The city was in an uproar but the
police reports were that the mob toad
refused to listen to thlp pleadings of

Jail. All prisoners, it was isaid, pre
viously had been placed in steel cages.
The jailer and other officers within

NORMAL SCHJDOL
SENIORS WON'T
GET ANY WAGES
Superintendent Slawson
Says He Doesn't See Why
They Should Be Paid.
- ...
The custom of paying each senior
of the Cfcty Normal school $25 for
senior year, either with classes at the
Normal school or when substituting
for other teachers, probably will be
abolished this year. The board of ed
ucation i has made no provision i for
these payments as yet and President
Havens and other members of the
board have not made up their minds
whether or not they will recommend
an appropriation for his purpose.
Superintendent of ' Schools Samuel
J. Sla-sspn said today that he did not
know wtjether or not the seniors
would be paid, for these services. He,
said that if payments were made they
would be-in one sum at the end of the
year, and not in small monthly pay
ments as has been ,the custom. He
said that personally he could sea no
reason for the payments. He said the
city furnished the Normal school and
opportunities to teach classes r to
substitute for teachers, was a part of
the training of the seniors for which
they ought to be grateful, rather than
expect pay. ''He said' the matted rests
entirely with the board of education
and he had no idea what action would
be taken.
- He denied the rumor that because of
the size of the Junior class at the Nor
mal school that elimination exeami
nations were to be instituted. The
class has 51 members and1 is the larg
est in the history of the city. Supt
Slawson said that the usual prelimi
nary examinations in music and ele
mntary work are being conducted and
it is possible some Vf the members of
the junior class will- fiot pass. Those
who fall will not be admitted for tui
tion. - - .

"Are you opposed to the right of

"And, assuming from your public
utterances that you do, do you be
lieve that those Members of Congress

so do you believe that you should
