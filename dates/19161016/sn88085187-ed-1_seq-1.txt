"The situation in this state has
been handled very badly and
something must be done to bring
Mr. Hughes' candidacy to life.
"It is my juilninc.ii that if
the election was held tomor

the state overwhelmingly. If
the election had been held
three months ago, no doubt
Mr. Hughes would have car

"The standpatters, following
the nomination of Mr. Hughes,
went on the assumption that there
was no other place to go but to
the republican party, nnd con

with the result that with very few
exceptions the men who were
prominent as progressives In this
