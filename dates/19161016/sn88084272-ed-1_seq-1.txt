"We of El Paso and Las Cruces are

through the agency of this congress

commencement of work on the great

"As if this did not place us in your
debt sufficiently, our obligation grows
in the telling, for I am reminded that
to this congress, and then only after
long years of struggle and discour

the passage of the reclamation act it
self, than which no greater piece of
constructive legislation has ever been

irrigation is not entirely selfish.

H DEFEATED
De Facto Troops Said to
Have Lost Heavily m Bat-
tie With Villistas.
That a force of 1000 Carranza soldi-
were defeated with heavy losses
in a battle with Villistas at Pan An
dres Saturday, was the information
brought to El Paso Sunday evening
by passengers on a train from Chi
huahua. Villa troops in small bands were
seen by passengers near the Cumbre
tunnel, where a score of Americans
were killed In an explosion several
years ago.
The train which reached Juarez Sun
day was fired upon by Villistas at Cnr
ralitos. but the train guard repulsed
the attackers, so declared passengers.
There were no losses reported.
It was learned here today that there
has been a considerable troop move
ment north from Chihuahua City, in
the past few days.
Although the Villista forces are con
centrating about 40 or 50 miles from
the American base, army officers here
do not rear an attack upon Gen

i Italian Soldiers Cannot
Be Seen Because Uniform
Is Color of the Landscape
Headquarters of the Italian Army,
Oct 16. The uniform of the Italian
army is said to be both the ugliest and
the least visible of any worn in Europe.
"Its wearer doesn't even make A
shadow." said one visitor recently
among the party of American officials
that accompanied ambassador Thomas
Nelson Page to the front
The color is officially described as
gray-green. An Englishman tried to
convey his idea of it as follows: "Take
some blue Nile mud. nib in carefully
two pounds of ship rat hair, paint a
roan horse with the composition, and
then you will understand why the Aus
trians can't see the Italian soldiers in
broad daylight at 50 yards."
The color was adopted ten years ago
especially for use in mountain fighting.
It and a sand-colored yellow for the
Italian troops Is expected to take part
in African desert fighting, as In the
case of the Tripoli war.
The Italian army was among the first
to make a science of the question of
uniform colors. It did not select for
instance, the horixon-colored uniform
adopted more than a year ago by the
French because while this is the least
visible on roads and plains of a flat,
open country, it would not do well in
the rains and muds and among the trees
of the mountains.
RUSSIAN, FRENCH AND
BRITISH ATTACKS FAIL
Berlin. Germany. Oct IS. British
troops attacked the German positions
northeast of Guedecourt three miles
south of Bapaume. and penetrated the
German first line but the ground was
recaptured after a counter attack, says
the official statement issued today.
French troops made an attack on
the German positions west of the town
of Sailly-Salllisel. the German state
ment adds. The attackers were driven
back south of the village by a counter
attack.
Strong attacks were made by the
Russians Sunday in Volbynia. west of
Lutsk. Today's official announcement
reports that these assaults broke down
with severe losses for the Russians.

TJ-Boat Problem Cleared;
Germany Now Negotiates
With Smaller Neutrals.
Berlin, Germany. Oct. 15. 'By way of j
London. Oct 16.) Norway. Holland and (
Spain are now playing the leading parts
in Germany's international submarine
problem, to the subordination of the
United States. The Associated Press
correspondent discussed the present
sitnation today with Dr. Alfred Zim
merman, under secretary for foreign
sffair.i, who indicated that the tables
had been cleared and that no negoti
ations were in progress as far as the
United States was concerned.
The case of Holland concerns only
the Bloomersdijk. which was sunk off
the New England coast bv the German
submarine U-al. Germany Is convinced
the submarine commander must have
kept within the German prize regula
tions as strictly enjoined. Full com
pensation has been offered In event the
commander exceeded his instructions.
Spain IIa Grievance.
Spain's grievances have to do with
he sinking of fruit steamers. Strictly
speaking these are valid prizes because
the carsoes are contraband, bound for
hostile ports. The Spanish government,
however, has pointed out that the pros

Take a Prisoner for Every
Yard of Trench Seized;
Foe Hides in Dugouts.
British front In France, Sunday.
Oct 15 (via London, Oct 16). In com
pleting the capture of Schwaben re
doubt on the .ridge above Thiepval, the
British took a prisoner for every yard
of front or 280 for a front of less
than 306 yards: not to mention the
number killed by the artillery prep
aration and in hand to hand fighting
before the eurvtvore surrendered. The
Germans manning the trench and those
in the reserve dugouts could hardly
have been crowded into one line back
of the parapet. This gives an idea ot
the importance the Germans attached
to that last bit of high ground along
their old trench lines south of the
Ancre on the Thiepval ridge.
After the British got the first half
of the redoubt the Germans made re
peated counter attacks to recover pos
session of it and for the last week
there has been no cessation of the
fighting. Now the British look down
an aioHK me " "rmucuwuri
and it is impossible apparently for the
Germans to maintain batteries in that
area.
German Hug Their Dugouts.
Between the new British positions
and the river along the old front line

manded by British guns from two sides,
still sticks to its maze of trenches. A

another section of ground.
In taking the remaining uncaptured
portion of Stuff redoubt in the same
region, the British took 104 prisoners
with a loss of 35 men.
Along the center of the battle line
the British have made some attacks
in the last week, though not in great
strength. They succeeded in some
places and failed in others against the
heavy German resistance. On the
whole, it was the quietest week since
the beginning of the grand offensive.
