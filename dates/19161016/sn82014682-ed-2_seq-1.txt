CAKG MERGER
IS STILL AFTER
s HAW. PIHEAPPLE?
Reports Say New Corporation
Has Not Abandoned Hope
of Local Concern ;
STOCK RISESAND IS
ABOVE FORMER FIGURES
One Closely Connected With
Company Says Directors
Would Not Consider Plan
Itumora continue to be heard that
Hawaiian Pineapple Company may be
secured by the big canning merger
recently perfected on the Pacific
coast and which include the Pine
apple Ireaervln? Company of "this ter
, . ritory as a. subsidiary of ' one .of lta
companies which went to make up the
new corporation. These rumora- are
receiving credence In some circles
hre and , the strength of Pineapple
Ktock on the local exchange Is credit
ed to auch reiwrta by some of these
' oi'le. "
- ' Before the organization of the new
big canning corporation in California
it was reported on the mainland the
Hawaiian Pineapple Company was to
be included. Manager Dole at that
time refused to confirm or. deny the
" report. Later the merger was formed
without including Hawaiian Pineapple
Company,- the . new company was in
' corporated,. Its' stock distributed, and
it is now regularly selling In the San
KrancLaco market. v
But despite the apparent end Of the
"- matter through the formation of the
company come, new rumors, this time
;to the effect that the,blg company Is
still seeking Hawaiian companies or
. at least one Hawaii company. If It can
be secured at the price desired. This
price the reports do not mention. It
J said that James D. Dole does not
.deny having heard such reports. On
the othsr hand a man, prominently con-
i)wUd T with : the. -local --company said
: that it U yno tm.derqig entering the
" merger; that Us directors are well sat
' Isfled with the way things are" going
tinder, present arrangement . . and
cannot see where any benefit to stock
holders "here wold result. .
' Original .reports from the coast,
which Included Hawaiian Pineapple
in the original merger as proposed.
I laced the price at which, the stock!
was to be taken at $50 and the stock
- U nowtquoted on the local exchange at
'$52 to S5. : J
Whether negt nations are under way
. with 8omeQf the larger shareholders
for their interest has not been learned
- nor Is 1t possible to determine wheth
er purchases In the market were made
for merger interests. The capital of
the company is $700,000 and at pres
ent market quotation It would require
$1,500,000 to acquire all of the stock.
