A Hasty Recall '
of Bluejackets
MADE BY DESTROYER M'DOUGAJ.
AT BAR HARBOR.
LEFT AT FULL SPEED
Action Gave Rise to a Report That
Some Important Development Had
Occurred Along the Maine Coast.
Bar Harbor, Me, Oct. 15. The hasty
recall of a liberty party from, the de
stroyer McDougal and the ship's sub
sequent departure at full speed today
gave rise to a report that some im
portant development had come up in
connection with the warship's neutral
ity patrol. The McDougal left East
port at 9 o'clock this morning and
With other ships of the destroyer flotil
la continued to watch the Maine coast
for some sign of a foreign submarine
or a submarine base of supplies- Early
in the afternoon she put in here and
gave shore leave to a party of her
sailors.
Men Recalled on the Run.
The men had not been ashore long
when four blasts of the ship's whistle
recalled them on the run to their boats.
The last boatload had hardly reached
the destroyer's side when she lifted
her anchor and steamed out of th
harbor under full power.
The wild coast line in this region,
with its innumerable coves, has long
been one of the favorite regions pickled
out by rumor for hidden wireless sta
tions and secret submarine bases. Ma
rine observers have pointed out that
some of the largest and fastest ships
ff the destroyer flotilla of the At
lantic fleet have been detailed for" neu
trality duty off this part of the coast.
CLAIMS U-53 VIOLATED
THE MONROE DOCTRINE
Contention of Jean Herbert, French
Military Strategist
Paris, via London, Oct. 15. The
German submarine U-53 made a
breach' in the Monroe uoctrine by
sinking vessels of the New F.ngland
coast and it remains to be seen
whether the United States will "sus
tain the celebrated American tradi
tion or let ij be cast aside," according
ot Jean Herbett, military strategist
and writer on international affairs.
"France is only a disinterested
spectator in the debate," says M.
Herbette, "because it makes little dif
ference to her whether the Germans
operate on one side of the Atlantic or
the other, but it produce a great
change in. the pnlitical equilibirum of
the-world- if the dictrine should be
abrogated by President Wilson. The
Jeffersonian maxim against European
interference on the other side of the
Atlantic applies in fact to American
waters as well as to the continent it
self, and when President Monroe in
formulating this doctrine prohibited
European powers from the prohibited
destiny of the American people he op
posed naval as well as military con
trol. One cannot be tolerated without
opening the door to the other."
M. Herbette recalls the ca.se of
French warships in 1870 cruising off
New York in watch for German ves
sels. The French ships violated no
laws, he says, yet their action resulted
In the American secretary of state
sending a warning note to France. The
principle then laid down has not been
forgotten, he adds.
"President Wilson,"' says he in con
clusion, "was no less categorical when
during the present war he upheld the
same rule with regard to England In
the case of the steamer Vinland.

Heavy Explosion at
East Machias, Me.
IN SECRET . STOREHOUSE OF
POWERFUL EXPLOSIVES.
SHOOK THE VILLAGE
Purpose for Which tho Explosive Waa
Intended is Not Known, Neither is
the Cause of the Explosion.
East Machias, Me., Oct. 15. An ex
plosion that shook this village about 4
a., m. today and was heavy enough to
be heard for ten miles, revealed the
fact that a building at the head oj
navigation on the East 'Machias rivei
had been used secretly as a storehouse
for some powerful explosives.
Owners Are Unknown.
Efforts to ascertain the ownership
of ithe explosive were unsuccessful to
day, th eauthorities placing little cre
dence in the suggestions of some citi
zens that a hidden cache for subma
rine warfare had been discovered. Re
ports that boats had been heard pass
ing up the river during the heavy
storm of Friday night and Saturday
morning could not be confirmed and
telephone messages from the coast
.guard station at Cross Island and
from Cutler, at the mouth of the river,
showed that no strange craft had been
seen In that vicinity.
Building Demolished.
The demolished building was owned
by Carroll DennisOn Of this village
and was used as a fish stand for a
short time each year in catching ale
wives. It was built in the middle of
the river. The owner said he had not
visited the place for several months
and that he had no knowledge that
anything was stored there.
Unfrequented Locality.
The theory held here is that some
one had taken advantage of the fact
that the locality was unfrequented to
hide dynamite in the building. The
quantity of explosive was apparently
large, judging from the concussion, but
the purpose for which it was intended
as well as the cause of the explosion
is undetermined.
