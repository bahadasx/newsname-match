SIMPLE TRICK GETS
RAILROAD TICKET
An ordinary trick smoothly played
netted a stranger eighty six cents and
R. S. Warlick, ticket agent o.t the Rock
Island, loser to a similar extent, being
the price of a ticket to Oklahoma City.
The bell in the engine attached to
No. 31 was clanging when a jycll
dressed woman rushed into tho station
and, approaching tho tickt window,
threw down a dollar and asked for
passage to Oklahoma City. Iustead of
exercising his usual caution tlio dis
penser of the little card boards threw
down tho token' without keeping a
. !1 1 1, J 1. .1 111
fiiiKcr upon n unui hu u ioiwch i
a purchaser's money. Quickly
woman smilingly told the agent to
keep the change and dashed out of
the station and to the train. Before
Warlick could get out of the office
the train was moving and there be
ing no witnesses to the transaction
and realizing that her word was as
good as his own he let the matter
drop.
Similar tricks are often tried but a
ticket agent makes it a point never to
Velease the ticket until lie takes in
tho coin. This does not imply that
everyone who buys a ticket would try
to get away with it but oftentimes
people absent-mindedly pocket the
ticket and forget in their hurry to pay
for it. But this does not "get next"
to the man who sells, as does the
habit of people who lose tickets by
hiding them in their clothing and then
"bawling" the agent "out" for having
neglected to deliver them. "This oc
curs frequently," says Mr. Warlick.
'and the bawling out usually occurs
when there are many bystanders. Of
course the man goes away to look
again for his ticket but he never
tomes back to tell you that he was
mistaken."

rains have fallen at times when they

PREDICTS GOVERNMENT
OWNERSHIP OF ROADS

Washington, Oct. 16. Uncle Sam is
going into the railroad business with
in the next decade, according to Ben
jamin C. Marsh, New York, executive
secretary of the real preparedness
committee of the Intercollegiate So
cialist society, an organization backed
morally and financially by Amos Pin
thot. "Every railroad in the United States
252,000 miles of them,'' said Marsh
today, "will pass from private owner
ship within ten years to be operated
in the interest of the public instead of
the interestate of privilege. ,
"The railroad' capitalists, being hu
man, wish to get wine prices for rain
water. It is our mission to squeeze
all the water out of the roads before
the government takes them over."
Declaring ultimate government op
eration of all roids inevitable, Marsh
said "the real problem is to see that
the properties are not unloaded on
the public at more than their actual
value."

CO-OPERATIVE
- GROCERY IS
LAUNCHED
With tho expressed Intention of
making customers ami therefore con
sumers participants lu the profits on
their own consumption, a movement
which was conceived several weeks
ago was consummated today when the
Modern .Supply Company, Inc., a cooperative-
grocery house opened its
doors to tho public at tho corner of
Fourth and Kansas avenue.
The Modern Supply company has
been incorporated with a capital of
f.'i.OOQ, divided into .'on shares of a par
value of io. K Is tho purpose of the
Incorporators to so distribute tho
atook that there would bo no possible
chance of a monopoly or control fall
ing Into the hands of any one person.
No stockholder can buy over ten
shures, not excepting tho officers and
manager of the company. In this
manner every holder of a, share will
have ail equal show.
The Idea of the co-operative, bro
eery house is to allow all stockholders
to derive portions of dividends accru
ing as tho result of their patronage,
lu other words they are discounting
their own grocery bills. . The affairs
of the company will he managed by
a board of directors consisting of five
persona who will appoint a manager.
It is likely that J. It. Miller,, who for
the past seven months has been man
ager of tho Model Grocery company
which is absorbed in the new enter
prise, will he made general manager
for the first term. Mr. Miller for five
years was an employe of the Powers
grocery before going into business for
himself and for a year v.sa senior
partner in the grocery firm of Mil
ler & Cox before establishing the
Model Grocery. He believes that with
a $5,000 stock and operating on a co
operative plan the business will he a
great success which will be enhanced
byother plans which the officers have
for the future, .
The stock holders will not only get
a profit, on every bill that he purchas
es but on those of his friends who
may he drawn to tho Modern Supply
grocery.

Atfernoon '
INCONSISTENCY OF
PROGRESSIVES SHOWN '
Allen Swan Reviews Great National Issues
at Bradley and Points Out Way
to Prosperity
Pointing out the inconsistency of
those progressives who would es.
pouse the cause of Hughes and aban
don the greatest progressive of the
age, urging the unification of the par
ty In the state and county elections
and giving an outline of the brilliant
achievements of the Wilson adminis
tration, Oscar Simpson won applause
after' applause Saturday afternoon
from one of the greatest public gather
ings which has ever assembled at ,
Alex.
Many farmers bad come to town
and were detained by tho rain. The
weather cleared up before four o'clock
and, realising that a treat was in
store for them, both homo and eoum
try people came out to hear the thrill
ing words of the Chickasha spellbind
er' who kept his audience enthralled
from his opening sentence until his
lust-appeal . for : unity and for 4hat
peace and prosperity v, liiit he said
would prevail as the result of the con
tinuance of Democratic legislation.
Mr. Simpson opened hi Alex speech
by launching Into tho merits ami de-
! merits of the great national issues.
He pointed out with great clearness
tho utter inconsistency of members
of tho progressive party who would
follow the HUghes standard and paid
considerable attention' to tho progres
siva leader, Roosevelt, who Had.
saken them and flopped over to
Hughes whoso policies and pirvioiis
record offered no assurance to pro- ,
gresi.ves, wlillo other leaders had re
mained, steadfast, in the fight and in
the absence of a recognized leader and
candidate had cast their lot with
Woodrow Wilson, the greatest pro
gressive who has ever taken tho lead
ership in American polities. These
latter progressives, ho asserted, hud
refused to unite under the Hughes
banner and were outspoken in tneir
advocacy of the candidacy of Hie great;
Democratic leader. If progressives be-
lievo lu their principles and are con
sistent they must vote for' Wilson,
he said. If it is but a passing fancy
and they are looking for legislation
diametrically opposed to the measures
which have brought this country to a
standard never before attained by any
other country on the globe, and this
is in the face of a world's war, then
they should vote for Hughes.
Mr. Simpson then drew an outline .
of situations which might, has arisen
lit the event of Hughes becoming
president under conditions similar to
those which have confronted Presi-
dent Wilson. With all Europe involv
ed in a death struggle Hughes proba
ble attitude could only be surmised
by his comments on the Lusitaiiia
case when he declared that diplomat
ic relations with Germany should
hav'e been severed. This, the speaker
declared, would have meant war with
Germany, which this country, for its
own good, is of necessity bound to
stay out of. He drew similar conclu
sions as to ; Hughes' attitude on the
Mexican situation asserting that indi
cations all point to the probability of
the recognition of liuetta under con
ditions prevailing threo years ago.
And in this the Republican nominee
would have been backed up by Roose
velt, he added.
Mr. Simpson took up Hit, broad topic
of Democratic legislation and showed
Where the farmer and the laborer had

ration of Preht Wilson.. The eoo.l
