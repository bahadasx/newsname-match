TEUTONS FOR HUGHES
German and Austrian Hosts
Break" Through the Gymes
Pass Into the Northwestern
Portion of Balkan Nation
London, Oct. 16. Teutonic trooos
have broken through Gymes pass and
Invaded northwestern Roumanla. ac
cording to Berlin dispatches today.
Severe fighting Is going on .on
Roumanian soli nesr the town of Pal
anka. The Austro-Germans are at
tempting to drive southward along
the Tergu-Ocna railway, to cut the
main railway line supplying the
northern Roumanian armies.
In the extreme north, near the
Bukortnlan frontier, the Roumanians
are falling back upon their own bor
der, but along the whole southern
frontier of Transylvania they are vig
orously counter-attacking. Southeast
of Kronstsdt the Roumanians have
wrested the Initiative from the
Austro-German army that attempted
to march southward Into Roumanla
and have won local successes.
The fighting In southern Transyl
vania Is becoming more violent In
the region north of Vulkan pass.
There the Roumsnians are pressing
their counterattacks and have
thrown back Austrian troop for a
considerable distance.
' In Macedonia the battle around the
bend of the Cserra river, where Bul
gers and 8erbs have been engaged for
several days, Is continuing, with the
outcome still In doubt.

which II were French and S3 Eng
lish, were shot down and fell Into
German hands during the month of
September, It was seml-offlolally
stated today.
DESTROYERS WERE
READY FOR ACTION
Washington, Oct. 18. A supersti
tion almost aa old as the navy was
responsible for the United States
destroyers being prepared for action
when they sailed on sudden orders
from Newport October 7. This was
explained today at the navy depart
ment, ln connection with the publi
cation of a letter from a lieutenant
on the destroyer Benham telling of
this preparedness.
The navy never has forgotten the
Chesapeake. The old man-of-war
Chesapeake sailed from Baltimore In
Ulme ot peaoe In .1807 without mak
ing preparation for war. With her
deck! stored with chloken coop and
other paraphernalia, of peace, she met
a British msn-of-war that was ready
for battle", Tbe Chesapeake was
searched and turned Ignomlnously
back to port,
"Since then." It was said, "when
ever a navyv vessel goes out on a
cruise It la ready for action."
The fact that the destroyers did
not know when they left Newport
what was going to develop whether
they might be attacked or whether
there had been violation of this conn
try's neutrality waa another factor
In the preparedness. They sailed
with almost no notice, knowing only
that, merchnnt nnd passenger vessels
were being torpedoed. They did not
know t that lime whether they were
going n nivbtlng vessels or as rescue
ships, They remembered the Chesa-
il-ptike,

lenges Statement by Wilson,
and Calls Attention to In
jury to Farmers' Interests
Hastings, Neb., Oct. 16. Republi-
csn Nominee Hughes today answered
President Wilson's strictures as to
the "invisible government" and tbe
republican party, and then struck em
phstlcally at the democratic sd min
istration's failure to consider pleas
of farmers for consideration prior to
enactment of the Adameon eight-hour
law. He spoke to an audience of
more than 1,000 people, assembled
ln tha open air on one of the streets
nesr the station.
"Let me say here," he remarked
with vigorous gesture, "that those
who are declaiming to the public
abont 'Invisible government' had bet
ter remember that when I wa tn
executive responsibility tn New Tork
there wa no 'Invisible government
In that state."
Hughes' reference to Ignoring of
the right of farmers to be heard In
any Increase of wages to railroad em
ployeswhich was bound to be re
flected In Increased freight rate
was particularly well received by his
audience of farmer. '
"I wish to aay with regard to
rates," he declared, "that It seems to
me the farmer of the country were
very little considered the other day
when, on the demand of the admin
istration, the wages of a certain
group of railway employe were In
creased by hasty legislation on the
demand of force. I do not believe
In that kind of legislation. It is very
thoughtless, to say the least, of the
Interests' of the , great agricultural
communities such a this; because, If

that the foreign policy of thei admin

Joke before all the other nation of
the world. She created great enthu
siasm and brought forth rounds of
applause by the masterful manner tn
which she tore Into argument of

democracy that "he kept us ont ot

do nothing, she said. Then she cited
Sweden and Norway and Denmark

of them had been Involved In war.
"When England opened Sweden's

when England "stopped Sweden's

Sweden for standing up for her rights
