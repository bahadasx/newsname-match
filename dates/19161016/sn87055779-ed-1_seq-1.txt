A "budget" system also has been
prepared for the state institutions,
for the purpose of determining in
the most intelligent manner their
actual needs.
A continuous inventory system for
the "store-rooms" of state institu

shows.
The state board has prepared a
complete "budget" system for state
offices, institutions, boards, bureaus,

to th.-e oflioers, the report says,

township supplies were quoted as
guides to the trustees. A total de
crease of $269.147.24 was affected
in the purchase of mad and school
supplies in the state during 1915

the price lisi guide, according to the

New Ambassador Announces
That Nation Will Protest
Against Burnett Immi
gration Bill.
International New- Sorrice: .
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16. The
new regime in Japan is preparing
to "forget" the controversy over the
California law forbidding Japanese
citizens to own land in that state.
Ambassador Sato, the new Japanese
diplomatic representative here, mad
this plain today in an interview with
a representative of the International
News service. He also expressed as
his opinion that Japan will, in every
possible way. demonstrate her
friendship toward the United States,
This statement is interpreted by
students of the situation in tne far
cast to remove, for the present at
least, one of the largest under-the-surface
causes for friction which
has jeopardized relations between
the United States and Japan.
To IVrKCt Controversy.
"We realize in Japan the consti
tutional restriction which prevents
the federal government from inter
ferinif with the legislative enact
ments of a single state," the am
bassador said today. "In conse
quence 'we shall 'forget the con
troversy altogether."
The new ambassador will, how
ever, press the protest against the
alleged inclusion In the UtJrnett im
migration bill to come before the
senate next December, of the Jap
anese as among tho "inferior" races
that cannot enter America. Am
bassador Chinda, predecessor of the
present diplomatic representative of
the Tokio government, twice pro
tested to the president against the
portion of the Iturnett bill under
stood to prevent, by inference, and
in a roundabout fashion, the natur
alization of Japanese.
.Matter Not Irpssinff.
"My government is convinced that
the Uurnttt law, while it makes no
direct mention of the Japanese."
Ambassador Sato said, 'is designed
to prevent the naturalization of
Japanese citizens in this country.
Aacainst such legislation we shall
continue to protest. However, that
matter Is not pressing because con
gress is not in session now, and
nothing immediate can be done."
The ambassador expects to go to
Shadow Lawn very shortly, pos
sibly the latter part of thU week,
to call upon the president formally,
and present his credentials. He
already has presented his creden
tials to the secretary of state.
