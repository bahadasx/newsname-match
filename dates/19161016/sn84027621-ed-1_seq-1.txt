WELCOME VISITORS
Congressman Clark, Legislator .Clark
and a Number of Army Officers
Here Sunday 4.
; Ocala had a bunch of pleasant visi
tors Sunday in the persons of Con
gressman Clark, his son, Frank Clark
J r., representative elect from Alach
ua to the legislature, and a number
of army and navy officers. . The latter
were Maj. Wm. CHarllee and Capt.
G. K. Shuler. of the mrin rnms
Capt. J. A. Mack and . Lieut. C. n.
m r
Chapin, of tfie coast" artillery ' and
Lieut. John T. Clement, of the infan
try. With them was Mr. E. Y. Breese
of Maj. Harlee's staff.
The visitors were a. fine-looking and
agreeable set of men, and Florida
claims two of them Maj. ' Harllee,
who is from Manatee county, and
Lieut. Clement, who is practically a
Marion county boy, tho he studied in a
Virginia military school and is one
of the comparatively few army officers
who were appointed from West Point.
The visitors arrived at the Ocala
House about 11 o'clock, coming over
from Gainesville in cars. They were
met by an informal committee con
sisting of Postmaster Rogers, Mayor
P.obertson, Editor Harris, Messrs. R.
A. Burford, R. S. Hall, Walter Hood,
Thomas Sexton, W. A. McGuire, W.
Austin Bennett, George Easterling,4 a
Star reporter and several others.
Messrs. Rogers, ; Robertson, Burford,
Hall, Hood and one or two more add
ed their autoes to the procession and
all mt out to the springs.
Silver Springs was entirely new to
the military and naval men, and even
the congressman and his son had not
seen its beauties as often as they
would have liked. They went but in
the glass-bottomed ' boat and had a
good look at the submarine glories.
and when they returned all declared
that it was prettiest sight of the sort
they, ever saw; Army and navy of
ficers are all traveled men, and their
testimony is worth having. " .
Returning to the city, the visitors
Were entertained at the Ocala House.
They had what was called a luncheon,
but it was really a solid and elegant
dimieiv .T16 vianf!.s3erfsLfiJt-faio-ity
style and Manager Bennett in per
son looked after the welfare of his
guests. ; Present at this very satisfy
ing" occasion were, besides the visitors,
Messrs. Rogers, Burford, Robertson,
Easterling and the Star man. V
t. The visitors had had early break
fast and a long ride, and they hearti
ly enjoyed their meal. After the
luncheon, they lit their cigars and
went over to rest and talk and smoke
on Mayor Robertson's broad and hos
pitable front veranda. Later in the
afternoon, they returned to Gaines
ville. : : - JV:'-''
The army and marine officers are
attending the great national rifle con
test at Black Point. Thev came over
to Gainesville to visit Mr. Clark, and
he took the opportunity to show, them
Silver Springs.
Some of the officers spoke verv
highly! of Black Point as one of the
best camps and rifle ranges in the
United States. They also praised our
pretty little city and regretted that
their stay had to be so short. They
carried away pleasant memories.
which the Star hopes will draw them
this way again.
The visit was a social one, and there
was no talk on politics and but little
of public affairs. Congressman Clark
however, answered questions about
the Ocala and Silver Springs canal,
and also gave Postmasters Roirers I
some information that will be ' wel
come not only to the people east of
the Oklawaha river, but to Ocala
folks. It seenr.s that Secretary Hous
ton of the department of agriculture
ha3 set aside a portion of the appro
priation of the department for roads
thru the national forests.; These roads
are not only for travel but for fire
guards.. As most people know, there
is a section of the national forest in
the country east of, the Oklawaha'
and at Postmaster Rogers' request
Mr. Clark is going to try to have the
department cut roads thru it. They
will give , the people of that section
much needed highways and aid Ocal
ans in visiting Salt Springs and other
points in that interesting region.
Frank Clark Jr., a shrewd and
clever young manvidently '.following
in his father's footsteps, highly com
plimented the roads of Marion county.
He said he would much rather travel
from Evinston toOcala thaa over the
same distance on the brick roads of
Duval. He says there is a movement
on foot to make a sub-road district in
western Alachua and bond for half a
million dollars and if it succeeds Mar
ion people will .find it much easier to
visit Gainesville than-, now. .

BRYAN & COMPANY SAY THEY
T WILL STOP THE LEAK
President Nash of the city 'council
has received the following letter from
Bryan & Company;
- Jacksonville, October 14, 1916. .
Mr. G. A. Nash. President Citv Coun
cil, 'Ocala, Fla- V
Dear Sir: We have your letter of
the 12th inst. In reply we wish to
say the mere fact, that we stated our
pumps of sufficient capacity to handle
the situatioir -werErnr service did Hot
mean that there was excessive leak
age in the tank, neither did the ex
pression of our willingness to do any
thing we reasonably could ta please
the council mean that we are in any
way liable for the conditions that you
claim exist.
The tank is of large capacity and
when we go to Ocala, if we should go,
we want to be satisfied that we have
pumping capacity to handle the sit.
uation under the most unfavorable
conditions..
If there was reasonable cause for
immediate action we would not wait
for the release of our pumping equip
ment though the cost to us would be
considerable. But there is no neces
sity for such haste as you are demand
ing, and we are not willing to go to
such unnecessary expense simply be
cause you demand it. ' f ,
If you are willing to wait until we
can release this pumping equipment
we will take it to Ocala, pump the
water down in the tank, and if there
is excessive leakage will stop it. We
can not, however, release this equip
ment for a few weeks. . .
. Yours very truly,
Bryan and Company,

MARION COUNTY BOY
MAKES HIGH CORN YIELD
. Lawton Martin is just a little, boy,
but he made a big corn yield. He ap
plied for membership in the Marion
county corn club last :: spring. The
county agent looked him up and down,
then walked around behind and look
ed again, f Lawton . was eleven years
old and that let him into the club with
a margin, but he looked pretty smalL
The agent talked with him a while,
but did not make any audible predic
tion. That boy had grit.
Lawton lives on Muclan farms,
near Electra in East Marion county.
He selected an acre of heavy muck
land, broke, prepared and planted it.
He did all the cultivating and kept all
the records himself. G. L. Herring
ton, boys' club agent for the Univer
sity of Florida Extension Division,
and R..L. Blacklock, county agent,
went out and measured Lawton's acre
and his corn the other day. He had the
acre all; right not a whit more, or
less. 1 He 'also had something else
115 bushels of corn which he had pro
duced at a cost of 13c. a bushel. He
did not use any fertilizer. His ex
pense record follows: Rent, $5; prep
aration of seedbed, $2.80; cost of seed,
$3.75; cultivation, $3.55; gathering,
$3.75. This gives him the biggest net
profit and j the next to' the' highest
yield that has been reported up to
date this jear in the state. Agricul
