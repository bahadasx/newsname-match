Tumulty. Answers Charges
About Delay in Appeal for
Irish Knight.
MAKES PUBLIC THE LETTERS
Quotes State Department to
Show Effort Was Made to
Save Prisoner.
ASDUnY PARK, X. J., Oct. l.-ne-pllng
to claims of Mrs. Agues New
inann, sister of Roger Casement, that
her brother's Ufa might have been
spared If the Senate resolution with
reference to his execution had been
presented In time. Secretary to the
President Joseph P. Tumulty, In a let
ter to Michael Francis Doyle, attorney
for Casement, today said the British
government had definitely assured the
State Department It could not grant
clemency regardless of any appeals
from the United States.
Tumulty made the letter public, be
cause, as ho writes to Doyle, "for many
weeks a futile cITort has been made by
nartlsans to make a political use. of
the fact that the resolution passed by
the Senate with reference to the execu
tion of Sir Itoger Casement was not
Immediately forwarded to the British
foreign office."
Statement By Polk.
Tumulty says he took the matter up
with Acting Secretary of Stato Polk,
who said: .. . .
"The State Department discussed the
Sir Itoger Casement matter with tho
British ambassador on several occa
sions. Informally but In great detail, be
fore the passage of the Senate resolution-
. ,. .
"The resolution was prepared on Sat
urday and the ambassador at once con
veyed the Information to the British
government. On Wednesday tho day
before tho execution, when the ambas
sador and I were again discussing the
subject, ho showed me the cable from
his government stating that the gov
ernment had considered the Casement
case and the resolution of tho Senate,
and had come to the conclusion that In
view of all the, circumstances If could
not grant clcmuncy.
Says Charges Are Untrue.
"The statement made In letters to
Mrs. Newman that had the resolution
been prosentcd In time her brother's
life would have been spared wore ut
terly and entirely without any founda
tion." No Change in Date

8-HOUR BILL HIS TARGET
Newspaper Men With G. 0. P.
Nominee See Him Growing
in Popularity Everywhere.
HASTINGS. Neb., Oct. 16 -rtefreshed
by a rainy Sunday of rest at Lincoln,
Nominee Hughes blazed a trail of analy
sis of alleged Democratic shortcomings
across Nebraska today. He chose as
tho particular ammunition of his ad
vance the Adamson eight-hour bill nnd
the "falso proipcrltj" of tho Underwood
tariff bill. '
Tho campaign program which Hughes
faced today contemplated four day
speeches here, at Grand Island, Colum
bus, and Fremont and a night meeting
at Omaha.
At tho last named stop those in
Hughes' confidence expressed the belief
that the Republican nominee would have
something new to say with reference to
the Democratic policy toward labor.
Hughes ha been asked by Nebrainta
Republican loaders to lay particular
stress In his campaigning on the eight
hour bill, labor topics and the tariff.
For that reason. It was expected today
that Hughes would discuss these Issues
almost exclusively.
Growing In Favor.
The most distinct impression gained
by the newspaper writers that have
accompanied the Republican cacdldato
In the last week Is that there have been
In that period definite, simultaneous In
dications that he Is growing In popular
favor.
Theie lias been a palpable feeling,
though not always easy to analyse, that
Mr. Hughes Is gaining strength with the
voters in States where prognosticate
had given him scarcely an even chance.
It has been Impossible to escape the
conclusion that somsthlng has occurred

rXbre'ls a recognised tendency on
the part of correspondents traveling
with candidates who draw enormous
crowds nnd who frequently stir their
audiences to emotional displays to
confuse public curiosity with nubile
favor, to become infected uncon

of the candidate himself and so mis
read the signs along the political
highways.

Hughes have sought deliberately to

Safe Arrival of Liners Leads to
Belief That Submarines
Have Left Atlantic Coast.
NEW YOrtK. Oct. 18.-Shlpments of
munitions to warring Europe will con
tinue unabated, unless more submar
ining occurs off tho American gate
wajs than has to date, marine men
said today.
While they did not discount the pos
sibility of new raids, the arrival of
tho giant French liner Lafayette, the
Scandinavian-American liner HHIIg
Olav, and the American liner St. Paul
lent strength to the thought that tho
raiders may now be streaking homu

of dimming her lights through the raid
zone, but encountored no enemy.
Weather Bureau officials said today
that tho possibility of autumn storms
may have driven tho U-boat to shelter.
From now on marked weather changes
and possibly squally and even dan
geroui weather are likely, to occur,

storms generally do not hit the pper
Atlantic until January.
From one of tho leading British lines
camo the statement today that tho
submarine raids have had Jiot the

traffic, aside from temporary delays
last week by holding boats In port.
Big quantities of war supplies are

CLUB BAR LICENSE
Anti-Saloon League Attorney
Charges Attempt to Emas
culate the Excise Law.
Declaring that efforts are being
made by liquor men to "emasculate
the excise law." and that continua
tion of such efforts will result in the
passage of a prohibition act for the
District. A. E Shoemaker, attorney
for the Anti-Saloon League, at a
hearing before the Excise Board to
day, entered a protest against the
Issuance of a liquor license to any
club located on a square having less
than 60 per cent business frontage.
Urging that the board stick to a
strict Interpretation of the law, Mr.
Shoemaker said:
"Let the liquor people break down
the present law regulating the sale
of liquor In the District and I promise
them that Congress will enact a law
prohibiting Its sale entirely."
Plays No Favorites.
"The Antl-6aloon League plays no
favorites," continued Attornoy Shoe
maker. "It treats every phase of the
liquor traffic exactly alike, and will con
test every point In tho excise law.
"Tho lcasun asks that tho law be fear
lessly administered. Clubs aro entitled
to no more consideration under the law
than a saloon. The sale of liquor In a
club Is no better than the sale of liquor
In the lowest and commonest saloon In
the city."
In his concluding argument Mr. Shoe
maker qualified his last statement by
saying It was not Intended ns personal,
but applied to the principle invoHed in
the sale of liquor anywhere.
Major A. S. Lanier, representing the
Army and Navy Club, presented a brief
upholding the club's contention of Its
right to a license.
Maj. Lanier Defend Licenses.
Major Lanier pointed to dlfforenta
tlons made In portions of tho law be
tween ordinary bar room and club li
censes, and said it was never tho inten
tion of Congress to exclude such clubs
a athe Army and Navy Club.
"It would be a great Injustice td the
Congiess of the United States." said
Major Lanier, "to assume that they
have perpetrated In ono of their solemn
acta sue ha Joko us would be involved
in a construction of the law contrary to
what I staatcd."
Mimllar armiments were offered by
Clarence It. Wilson, representing the
Metropolitan Club, and Johcsph E.
Sullivan, representing the Commercial
Club. i
M, M. Parker, representing the Uni
versity Club, Fifteenth and I streets
northwest, argued that under the
strictest Interpretation of the law It
was enltled to a license as more than
SO per cent of the frontages on both
squares are occupied by boarding
houses, which should be classified as
"business frontages."
An arirument In favor of the llnuor
licenses to hotels on squares having
lesH than 50 per cent business front
age was Affered by Alexander Wolff.
