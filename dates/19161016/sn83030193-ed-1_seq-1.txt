When thn jrre.it French liner L
fayetto reached Quarantine to-day
sot one of her 325 rasscnBors, many
noted Amertcnns among them, knew
tht the ship's oincers had been noti
fied before she nulled Jrom Bordeaux
ounauy a week ngo mat me u-D3 nau
called at Nowport. Nor did they i
have any hint of the word which j
reached tho ship ly wireless tha next
day that five ships had been sunk by
the submarlno rnlder off Nantucket. '
Tho nown came to them with a ,
hock and they fairly fought for
newspapers telling of tho peril thoy
had escaped. All had been mado
more or Ions nervous by tho uncer
tainty, because of tho unusual con
duct of tho Lafayette's ofllcors. that
something out of tho ordinary had
happened.
All last night and the night before
tha Lafayette followed her courso
without u light showing. Approaching
Nantucket Hhonls light, whero tho
i submarine was octlvo a week ago, tho
hip sheered off abruptly and steamed
far to tho south and then as sharply
.resumed hor rcgulur course.
SHIP'S OFFICERS SIGHTED NO
SUBMARINES.
Some of tho passengers said she
slgzagged past Nantucket." Hut tho
Officers Insisted tho precautionary de
tour could not fairly bo ho described.
They saw nothing which looked like
'a submarine.
From tho beginning of tho voyage
sdl boats were slung out on tho davits;
the sevcnty-slx millimetre gun on tno
'iter deck wan always ready for uc
Jtion and all obstructions to Its being
felfhtod over either rail and to the
artsm were cleared away.
OX all the poaaongers, Enrico Caruso,
(1m tonor, was furthest from depres
ton. All in blue, from spats to over
coat and cap, and wearing an up
turned Prusslanlied mustache, for
wileh ho demanded tho approval and
admiration of the friends who greeted
biro at tho pier, ho fairly ovorflownd
With high spirts. Ho held a largo
gathering with an operatlo recital of
his experiences as a poultry fancier
at his place near Florenco, tho Villa
Bellas Guardo. Ho trilled tho cacklo
of tho hen and tho clarion of tho
rooster.
"For throa months thoy wake mo
at 8 o'clock In tho morning, so (re
peating tho barnyurd motives). All
day long for threo months thoy keep

Force to Be Added to 70,000

By Carl W. Ackerman.
ESSEN, Germany, Oct. 16 (United
Press). Twenty thousand new work
ers this vweek will Join the force of
70,000 already employed at the great
Krupp gun works In tho glgantlo task
of turning out Bholls and guns for tho
Gorman armies.
The addition of this forcit Is ono
step In tho course Germany's renewed
efforts to win tho war Is taking undtr
tho direction of Field Marshal von
Hlndenburg, now Chief of Staff. Many
skilled workmen are Iwlng recalled
from tho front to old In apeedlng up
thn production of war supplies and
barracks aro being built hero to houso
thorn.
From conversations with Krupp di
rectors, with August Thyeson, tho
"Carnegie of Germany," and other In
dustrial leaders, threo facts booamo
apparent regarding tho German cam
paign slnco Hlndenburg assumod lead
ership.
First Germany plans to main
tain her supremacy In thn artillery
branch of warfare by Increasing
the supply of guns,
Second Hy ronuwod submarine
efforts sho plans to Mop contra

Industries throughout tho entire
Ithlno and Ituhr valleys, where shells
roll out weokly by tho millions, are
preparing tho army for tho llnal
strotch, A visit to the grout gun
plants horo gives onu an Impression of
tho gigantic plans Germany Is mak
ing. Essen now feels so secure against
posslblo nlr raids that the anti-aircraft
guns bavo been removed. Dofensu of
the city was found to be unnecessary
bee-nine thn smoko rising from a hun

it Impossible for aeroplanes to dis

cities. In tho latest allied air raid,
thrca children wore killed and tho
roof knocked off one housa near
Essen, but the Krupp establishments
worn not touched.
Tho plants aro growing like mush

slzo may bo gathered from tho fact
that In one htoro yard a million shells
aro kept always nn hand.
In ono building 1,100 men were

MEETING TO END

Judge Who Counselled Peace
Fropi Platform.
DISORDER KF.PT DOWN.
Mrs. J. Sergeatjt Cram Barred
Out of Strike Zone by
the New Jersey Police.
The hops that the striking em
ployees and the officials of the Stand
ard Oil Company at Ilayonnn would
sottln their differences to-day came
to an abrupt end when 1,600 strikers,
assembled In Mydosh Hall, strenu
ously voiced their disapproval of a
plan to end the strlkn set forth by
former Police Judge Hymnn Lazurus,
acting as the representative of Mayor
Garvin.
Tho strikers, crying that they did
not Intend to be sold out, drovn Judgo
Lazurus from the platform anil
cheered statements mudo by their
leaders that tho strike would go on
until their demands had been
granted.
Whllo there has been no resumption
of tho violence that marked tho strike
last week, the Police Department,
augmented by several hundred volun
teers, has not relaxed Its vlgtlanqe.
Tho strikers left the meeting In nn
angry mood and tho strong pollen
guard about thn hall Is believed to bo
the only thing that prevented another
outbreak.
Judgo Lazurus, after pointing nut
to tho strikers that they would gain
nothing by tho violent methods they
hud been pursuing, nald tho tlmo hud
comn to settle tho strike. In Uil.i
connection ho suggested that a com
mittee consisting of ono man from each
of the six departments, assisted by
James H. Dougherty, counsel for the
strikers, und himself bo appointed to
confer with Supt. Hennessey and other
olllclals of the Standard Oil Company.
When Judge Lazurus followed with
the suggestion that this committee be
given full power to end tha strlkn the
strikers rose ns ono man and shouted
their objections to tho plan.
Many of tho strikers reminded
Judge Lazurus of the fact that, as
editor of a Hayonno newspaper, ho
has been printing largo advertise
ments stating tha Standard Oil Com
pany's side of the dispute,
George N. Moloher was chairman
of the meeting. Ho criticized Judgo
Lazarus for suggesting the plan,
"From now on, men,'' Meloher de
clared, "wo will run our affairs with
out outside Interference Wo will not
be sold out by any ono. Unless thoy
ngreo to better our working condl
tlons the Ilayonnn poorhousn Is going

Mrs. J, Sergeant Cram of New York
reached Hayonne to-day In her motor
car. Sho bald she wanted to help the
strikers. When sho announced her
