school. " i"j s
The game wna' good 'fronTtirc spec"
tutors' point of view. Senantlona tni
kicking, running and tackling were
furnlahed, besides n display of fight
that astonished everyone.
Medford got the Jump, and early In
the first half made two touchdowns
and kicked onu goal after touchdown.
Klamath was on tho dofonslve, both'
because those were Instructions and
because sho couldn't help herself. Uut
after Graham Klehl had mndo a long
end run for a touchdown the local
boys were encouraged, Klamath open
ed up her offensive, and tore down
tho field for good gains consistently.
Moth teams will improvo greatly
with more oxpcrlonre and coaching.
Fumbling was too frequent, and poor
Judgment In selection of ploys was
ahown more than once. Klamath's
tackles played too wldo, and tho do
feme ngalnst forward passes was
weak.
Tho gnmo showed good stuff In
several of tho loco! boys whom It wos
thought didn't have much. Krnel
Stearns, small and Inexperienced,
played his guard position far above
expectations and mndo a grcut many
tackles for one playing a guard posi

that saved tho day. He dropped tho
Mniirnrii runner with a thud after the
V'nnor had penotrnted tho 'line arid
got by one halfback.

made her best golns on offtiicklo

several beautiful punta and was
blocked only once because ho was too
close to tho lino of scrimmage. Adams
smashed rhe Medford line for good
