ly Injured when a train on the Bur
liiigton railroad crashed into a freight
caboose 12 miles east of here this
morning. Five other men standing on
the rear platform of the caboose saw
the approaching train soon enough to
Jump to safety. One man in the ca
boose cupola was thrown clear of the
wreck and escaped injured. The trains
in collision were sections ol a regu
lar stock train. Lack of lights and
warning signals is given by survivors
as the cause of the accident. All the
victims are residents of Nebraska
towns of western and central parts of
the state, most of them farmers or
stockmen.
The dead: W. H. Merrill of Wallace
Adam Miller of Rain William Kil

The trains in collision were the
second and third sections of number
166. The second section had trouble
with hot boxes and had stopped at a
point about half way between Smith
Held and Bertrand.
The crew of the second section was
at work on the hot boxes when the
third section crashed into the second
section caboose. No one was aware
of the danger until the third section
was within a few yards of the rear
end of the second.
The twenty-one men In the caboose
were jammed into a- space of less
S than four feet in width and this was
filled with wreckage.
The railroad ran a special train
from Holdredge With physicians and
the injured were taken to Hastings
for hospital care.
It is reported that two of the injur
ed died on the way to Hastings.

BY PAPfRM ASTER
Use of Name of Rabbi B.
Papermaster a Mistake—
It Should Have Been
Emil I. Pyes.
On Thursday morning, September
28, the Herald, published an article
relative to the arrest of Abe Goldstein
and the justice court proceedings
which took place.late the, night pre
ceding. In that' article the statement
was made that "the warrant was
sworn out by Rabbi B. Papermaster.
charging the prisoner with disturbing
the peace and'dignity of a religious
meeting, etc." and further that "this
so disturbed the religious festival that
Rabbi B. Papermaster felt called upon
to have his unruly parishioner
brought before the bar of justice."
Upon further Investigation it ap
pears that the Information gathered
and published concerning the disturb
ance was erroneous, for the reason
that Rabbi B. Papermaster did not
swear out the warrant but that the
Bame was in fact sworn out by Emil
I. Pyes, and further that Rabbi Pa
permaster had nothing whatever to
do with having his unruly parishioner
brought before the. bar of justice. On
the contrary it is stated that Rabbi
Papermaster knew nothing of the dis
turbance until he read of the same
in the Herald the following morning
and that he was not out of his house
at that late hour of the night as stated
in the article.
The Herald regrets exceedingly any
injustice that may have been done by
the publication of the article referred
to and is glad of an opportunity to
set the facts correctly before the peo
ple, in order to correct, as far as pos
sible, any wrong impressions that may
have been created.
COAL SHORTAGE IN N.Y.

New Tork, Oct. 16—A shortage of
coal is in prospect for this city this
winter, according to an announcement
by dealers today, who declared their
bins are being depleted, shipments are
delayed, and that the outlook for im
mediate or eventual relief is poor. The
shortage applies both to hard and soft
coal. The failure to receive the usual
amount of coal is attributed to the
scarcity of labor at the mines and a
lack of cars for transportation.

LEE ADMITS 8 HOUR
LAW IS WAGE BILL
Brotherhood President, Heckled
Cleveland, Says Possibly "Pub

In
Cleveland. Ohio,- Oct. 16.—The
Adamson so-called eight-hour law is
in reality a law Increasing wages of
railroad employes-
The foregoing was the admission
made unexpectedly by William G. Lee,
president of the Brotherhood of Rail
road Trainmen, while under the fire
of heckling questions by members of
the City club.
"Yes, the bill will increase the
wages of railroad workers," Lee said.
"Call the bill what you wish."
Apparently to qualify this reply to
the Insistent demand of Attorney M.
V. Emerman that he state whether
he considered it an "increased pay"
bill or an "eight hour measure," Lee
then declared that "in some instances
it will also make for a shorter work
day."
"Isn't it true that this act has been
promulgated as an eight hour law
when in reality it merely increases
railroad men's pay, and to that extent
the public has been misled?" asked
William V. Backus, attorney.
"It may b'e that the public is being
misled," said Mr. Lee. "but it is al
most impossible to correct any such
misconception."

To Provide for Commission.
The bill now being drafted will pro
vide for a civil service commission of
three members, who will draw no:sal
ary, or, at'the most, only a par diem.
The board will have a full paid secre
tary, who will be the executive offi

advises that it is not Intended that the
law shall remove from office employes
now on duty in various departments
and institutions, but it will provide no
advancement Or increase in salary for
such employes except through a
standard civil service examination,
and these employes who have not tak
en the civil service examination may
be removed without trial, as under
present conditions.
Widely Extended.
Civil service is now in effect in ten
Btates and 250 cities, in addition to
the federal government, -the Philip
pines, Hawaiian islands, Porto Rico
and every province in the Dominion of

the Pullman Car Co. and Bears-Roe

To Be Efficiency Nemnli.
The administration's civil service
bill will be essentially an efficiency

The British front in
France, Oct 15, via London,
Oct. 16.—In completing the
capture of the Schwaben re
doubt on the ridge above
Thiepval, the British took

less than 30D yards, not to

Germans attached to that)
las,t bit of high ground along
their old trench line south of
Ancre on the Thiepval ridge,
which their desperate resist
ance characterized as the
most precious two-acre plot
in all France.
After the British got the
first half of the redoubt, the
Germans made repeated
counter attacks to recover
possession of it, and for the
last week there has been no
cessation of fighting.
Now the British look
down all along the valley to
Grandecourt. Apparently it
is impossible for the Ger

in that area. Between the

the river along the old front

ALIUS REPLY
ON MAILS NOT
SATISFACTORY
President Wilson Says He
Cannot Get Action Until
After Election.
Washington, Oct. 16.—Examination
of the allies' note on the censorship
of mails, made public this morning
has brought a feeling among officials
that it does not satisfactorily meet
the protests set forth in the American
note of May 24.
The state department has watched
with interest, however, the informal
arrangements made by British author
ities throughout their trade depart
ment and through such conferences
as that of Sir Richard Crawford in
New York recently and is understood
to feel that resentment among Ameri
can citizens over the allied censor
ship has been greatly lessened.
It is thought unlikely that any re
ply will be made in the three weeks
before election. In this connection
diplomatic circles attach much signifi
cance to President Wilson's declara
tion at Long Branch yesterday that
"it is almost impossible to do anything
positive" in the fields of foreign af
fairs during the campaign.
Secretary Lansing declined tonight
to discuss the mail seizures negotia
tions or to interpret President Wilson's
statement regarding the administra
tion's position in dealing with foreign
affairs. The president's declaration he
said, spoke for itself and needed no
amplification.
In their reply the allied govern
ments reiterate their, right to inter
cept ana search all" genuine mail
found on neutral vessels on the high
seas or in allied ports, but.they prom
ise to remedy "any faults, abuses or
serious mistakes," in Censorship that
may be brought to their attention.
They declare unjustified by facts the
American charge that illegal jurisdic
tion has been gained by diversion of
neutral ships from the high seas into
the territorial waters of the allies.
Demand for Radical Change.
The reply is to Secretary Lansing's
memorandum of May 24. in which the
United States declared the allies had
been guilty of "lawless practices" in
their mail censorship methods and
"that only a radical change, restor
ing to the United States its full rights
as a neutral power will satisfy this
government."
It is maintained by the allies in
their latest note that they are en
deavoring to avoid any encroachment
on the legitimate exercise of the rights
of inoffensive neutral commerce.
Delays and annoyances are un
avoidable, it is pointed out, in the ex
ercise of full belligerent rights by the
allies and a long list of precedents
are cited to support the validity of
the allied censorship methods.
It is suggested that The Hague con
vention quoted in the American mem
orandum is not binding because it has
not been ratified by several belliger
ent powers, though the allied policy
has been guided by the intentions it
expresses.
It argues that the United States
and the allies agree that the postal
union convention does not apply and
that postal packages may be examin
ed to see if they contain contraband.
That being so, the note contends it is
necessary to open postal bags and ex
amination cannot take place at sea
without delay and inconvenience. Ar
rangements now have been made to
carry on the examination with the
least possible delay and to forward
innocent articles to their destination.

VIENNA LONGS

But Little Hope is Seen as
Yet that Warring Powers

GERMAN ALLIANCE IS
FIRM FOR OWN TERMS
Looks For First Break to
Come From Russia Af
ter Another Drive,
Vienna, Oct. 1.—(Correspondence
of the Associated Press)—With a keen,
longing for peace has come persistent
speculation in the central states as to
the manner in which this blessing
may be secured. But all thought on
the subject remains what it has been
for nearly two years, the substance1
of the person's own wishes. Political
and military circles today are as far
from Eeeing a definite plan for the
cessation of the war as they were
when the catastrophe first over
whelmed Europe.
In Berlin and Vienna they continue
setting their teeth when the word
peace is mentioned, not because war
is wanted but for the reason that up
to this moment the entente govern
ments have shown no inclination to
entertain a meeting on this ground.
"If the fear prevailed in the cen«
tral states that a peace with honor,
and possibly profit, could not be se-'
cured, owing to military and eco
nomic weakness, then thought might
run in a different channel. But that!
the entente has not shown that it can
ultimately realize its own hopes is the
universal view held in Austria-Hun
gary and Germany and their allied
countries.
"The offensive on the Somme. the
Russian attack in Bukawlna and in
east Galicia, the entry into the war
of Rumania and its immediate con
sequences, the campaign of Sarrail
from Saloniki, and the exertions of
the Italians have all contributed to
ward the feeling in the central group
that the resistance met by the entente
may yet open the eyes of those who
first announced that they will be sat
isfied with a peace whose terms will
not have been the dismemberment of
central Eprope as a basis.
The central governments, so much
may be said, are ready today for a
peace which would leave Europe
much as before the war with the ex
ception that Poland, must be made
an autonomous state and that neither
Belgium nor Serbia can again trouble,
innocently or purposely the quiet of
Europe.
There is here not the faintest indi
cation that the entente is inclined to
enter negotiations on that basis. That
being the case, the end of the war
seems as far off as ever. In Vienna
and Berlin nobody can yet see why
the central group should make con
cessions since they claim to hold
trumps everywhere by the occupation
of enemy territories so large that the
