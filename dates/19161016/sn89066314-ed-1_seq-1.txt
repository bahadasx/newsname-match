Forces at Krupp Gun Works
Increased to 90,000
Barracks Built.
3 PLANS UNDER WAY
Kaiser Gathers All Forces to
Crush England on Land
and Sea.
Bj United Press.
,ESSEN, Germany, Oct. 16. Twenty
thousand new workers will this week
join the force of 70,000 already em
ployed in the great Krupp Gun Works
In the task of turning out shells and
guns to supply the German army. The
addition of this huge force is one step
in the course of Germany's renewed
efforts to win the war, taken under
the direction of Field Marshal von
Hindenburg. Many skilled workmen
are being recalled from the front to
aid in speeding up the great sup
plies, and barracks are b'eing b.ullt
here to house them. -1-
From conversations with Krupp di
rectors, with Ernest Thyssen, "the
Carnegie of Germany," and other In
dustrial leaders, these views were
learned regarding the German cam
paign since von Hindenburg resumed
leadership:
First, Germany plans to maintain
her supremacy in artillery by increas
ing the supplies of guns and mu
nitions; Second, by renewed submarine ef
forts she plans to stop contraband go
ing to England from neutral European
countries, to halt ammunition ship
ments from America to England and
to stop Canadian transports carrying
troops to Europe;
Third, by an offensive against Rus
sia and Rumania and by maintaining
an iron-wall defensive on the West,
she plans to crush the Allies until
they make peace.

Preparations Made.
z
About 100 applications for member
ship In the Missouri Union have been
received since Friday night, when ap
plication blanks were distributed at
the mass meeting. Committees from
each school in the University are now
at work on the campaign. Seven ap
plications for life membership have
been received since the life member

"What does the Union mean to
you?" was asked of K. F. Schulte, as
he applied for membership this morn

In it," he replied.
"We intend to make the Student
Union Building a lounging place for
all students for the 'next month, at
least, regardless of whether they are
members of the Union or not," was
the statement of H. H. Kinyon, corre
sponding secretary of the Union.
Ten years ago, when Michigan first
adopted the union plan, the organiza
tion had 20 per cent of the student
body as members. Now it has 75 per
cent of the student body and is work
ing on a new union building to cost
$750,000. The proposed union building

Bishop Williams Emphasizes
Necessity For "Sauls" in
Public Service.
"BIG MEN HIDING"
Says Those Fitted to Lead
Shirk, While "Fool Re
formers" Offer Help.
What the American people wants is
to know what to do, not what not to
do, as so many of our reformers are
pointing out; they want a driver on
the box who knows where he is go
ing, the Rev. C. D. Williams, Bishop
of the Episcopal' Church in Michigan",
declared in his address at the Uni
versity Assembly this morning.
Doctor Williams took as his subject
the phrase, "Hiding in the Stump, or
the Evasion of Leadership." He com
pared the United States today with the
Israelites before they got Saul as their
leader. "We are a young people," he
said, "not yet really a nation. Our
social consciousness is not developed
well enough for social solidarity. The
men most fitted for leadership are
hiding themselves, shirking their
duty.
Commercial Life Attracts.
"We are enormously rich, the rich
est people on the face of the globe;
but we are just beginning to see the
need of husbanding our resources.
Our main task is still that of making
money, building up prosperity. We
worship success. We have so far not
been much concerned with how the
millionaires made their money, es
pecially if they have been liberal
givers to charity. We have our aris
tocracy, before whom we all bow
down. Social workers arc apt to be
looked down upon, and artists, sci
entists and statesmen are merely tol
erated. For these reasons the call to
a commercial life sounds louder to the
American youth than anyotherJL,.
Lack of culture, feebleness of social
consciousness and moral color blind
ness are some of the accusations
made against America, Doctor Wil
liams pointed out. "The new awaken
ing is the cause of religion, a spiritual
awakening, a religious revival of a
big and noble form," he declared. "It
is the spirit of God moving in the
hearts of men. Who will answer this
call? Crack-brained and half-baked
reformers have been the ones so far
to offer help. The world suffers
more from fool reformers than from
having no leaders.
Tells Church of Duty.
"The state is educating men and
women so that they can lead the state
and not merely so tliey can make a
living. It is to" the college graduates
that we look for our leaders. But
students come out of our universities
and colleges trained for public serv
ice and go into private pursuits.
"We need the scholar in politics to
day. Politics is the highest service
to society. We need trained states
men. We need the scholar in Indus
try. We want cultured and humanized
men who shall realize the fine art of
the social life. The best social serv
ice is being done inside industrial in
stitutions. We need the scholar in
the editorial chair. We want men
who shall redeem the press from be
ing the mere trailer of public opinion
to being the molder of that opinion.
Much of our press is realizing that
mission. Finally we need scholars in
the pulpit Religion is outstripping
the church. The church must keep
up."

ganization for Prohibition.

GET CLUB NEAR CITY
L
State Capital Country Organ
ization Far From Town,
Writes Member.
SITES HERE HANDY
Local Supporters of Idea Re
ceive Suggestions From
Those Experienced.
With the progress of the idea of a
country club for, Columbia, warnings
from other clubs as to what not to do
in the formation of the club and its
location are being received by local
men interestedn the movement.
One regarding the location of the club'
is given in a letter from Morris G.
Gordon, secretary of the Jefferson
City Country Club.
"Our club is five miles from the city
and we have found It a great disadvant
age," Mr. Gordon says. "I would sug
gest that if the club for Columbia is
formed, as it undoubtedly will be, you
select a site which is nearer the city
and more convenient for everyone
concerned."
The sites which have been suggest
ed to the men of Columbia who are to
begin the movement for the organiza
tion of the club are all within walk
ing distance of the heart of the town.
"This is one of the first considera
tions," said a Columbian today. "In
order that the club may be a success
in Columbia, I feel that it should be
on the outskirts of the town or within
a mile of the city limits. We cannot
afford to select a site which will be
inaccessible to the people of Colum
bia who do not own a motor car."
The Jefferson City Country Club
was organized by the efforts of one
hundred men interested in the move
ment. An organization was effected
and the club incorporated. A mem
bership fee of $100 was charged,
giving the club a working capital of
$0,600. The membership was limited
tp' 100.
-. f
After the formation of the club, a
site costing $10,000 was purchased.
Soon after the selection of the site,
arrangements were made to build the
clubhouse. This -was erected at a
cost of $8,000. The club has also ex
pended money to improve the site
and make a golf course.
The annual maintenance of the club,
according to the secretary, is $200 a
month. The annual assessment made
in semiannual payments is $24 a mem
ber. All additional costs are charged
to the individual members.
LIKES COUNTRY CLUB IDEA
ttrl It. 31. Burgess Writes Mlssourian
Faioring Such an Organization.
Dr. R. M. Burgess, rormerly a den
tist here and well known to every
Columbian, writes the Missourian
commending the idea of a country
club for Columbia. Doctor Burgess
says in part:
"I am glad to read in the Missou
rian that the people of Columbia are
waking up to the idea of a country
club. Don't let your paper rest until
you get the club. Something like this
will broaden the people and make the
town grow."

V. I. VAX J)YXE LEAVES TIGERS
Veteran Lineman Called Home by
Serious Illness of Ills Father.
C. D. Van Dyne, veteran tackle of
the 1916 Tiger football team, will
leave the University tonight for his
home at Sedalia, called there by the
serious illness of his father. He has
no idea when he will return.
The loss of the star lineman, just
at the time when the chances for a
victorious team looked brightest, fell
like a bomb in the Tiger camp at Rol
lins Field. VanDyne has been play
ing his third year with the Varsity,
and since the first practice this year
has been receiving praise from the
entire coaching staff.
" 'Van' is one of the most consistent
players we have," said Director Brew
er this afternoon, "and we'll have a
hard time getting along without him.
Right off-hand, of course, I think of
'Snooze' Groves, who has been play
ing in the hackfield, as tTie most likely
man for VanDyne's place. Shannon
and Shy, who have been showing up
well in the scrimmages, also will have
a chance for a place at tackle."

the Results.
Shoppers from twenty-four cities,
towns, and rural communities, calling
for a railroad rebate on 1,810 miles in
six days this is the record for Co
lumbia's first Trade Week as shown
by rebate slips turned in at the Mis
sourian office till noon today. This
means that the rebate plan induced
people not trading in Columbia to
travel a total of 302 miles each day
to do their shopping here and take ad
vantage of the railroad refund plan.
".My out-of-town business last week
showed an increase of fifty per cent
over that of the same week last year,"
was the report this morning of I. A.
Barth, president of the Retail Mer
chants' Association. "This was an in
crease of 30 per cent over my busi
ness the week! before. I consider prac
tically all the people to whom I gave
rebate slips new customers or old cus
tomers "brought back to the Columbia
stores by Trade Week."
It is estimated that the week result
ed in an increase of twenty-five per
cent in Columbia's out-of-town trade.
Shoppers From Many Towns.
The places from which shoppers
were drawn to Columbia during the
week are: Moberiy, Gallatin, Paris,
Shaw, Ashland, Woodlandville, Halls

and the ability of the local stores to
satisfy their wants in all lines of mer
chandise.
Will Draw Future Trade.
The bulk of trade on which railroad
fare was refunded during Trade Week
means new business for the local mer
chants. Few of the regular out-of-town
customers who made purchases

slip. One merchant sold over $200
worth of goods to an out-of-town fam
ily without receiving a demand for the
rebate slip. The new shoppers have

knowledge of Columbia that will draw
future trade. The. first Trade Week

POLICE FIND STOLEN CAR
Automobile Identified as One Taken
at Mexico, Friday.
Early this morning the police found
in a ditch near Moore's Station the
seven-passenger automobile stolen
from J. A. McPheeters of Mexico, Mo.,
Friday afternoon. The car was driven
to Columbia Friday night, used in
public service until last night when,
from present appearances of the ma
chine. It was ditched after a Joyride.
The police are searching for Ora
Mann, Columbia's speed bug, who is
suspected of the theft Mann was in
Columbia yesterday but today he
could not be found, according to the
chief of police. When found this
morning the front of the car was ram
med into the mud with the rear end
up in the air. Tracks in the road in
dicate that the car must have been
going rather fast when it ran into. the

it and get under cover before they
were discovered with the stolen ma
chine.
