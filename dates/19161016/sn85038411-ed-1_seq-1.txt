FALSE ADS TO
BRING ARRESTS
Commerce Chamber to Prose
cute Tradesmen Who Publish
False Statements
Tradesmen who publish false and \
misleading advertisements or practice '
frauds upon customers who patronize;
their establishments will be vigorously j
prosecuted by the Harrisburg Cham- j
ber of Commerce.
The executive committee of the
Harrisburg Chamber of Commerce
held a meeting this morning and de- ;
cided that, hereafter any unethiea; j
practices on the above character of;
Harrisburg merchants would be:
handled without gloves.
The number of traders who may be'
addicted to false advertising or frauds
is almost too small to be noticed, but
the Chamber of Commerce believes \
that the buying public, especially the j
laboring classes, are entitled to full
protection against anyone who takes
advantage of the high reputation of i
the vast majority of Harrisburg retail j
establishments and misleads their i
customers.
In the past the Chamber of Com
merce has taken a number of pro
tective measures against such gentry
by stopping illegal auctions, unworthy
special advertising schemes and warn
ing firms not to publish false adver
tising.
From this .time on, however, the
Chamber intends to permit the courts
to deal with traders who deceive their
customers.

CITY ASKS MORE
TIME TO SOLVE
SEWAGE PROBLEM
Harrisburg Requests State's Co
operation in Seeking Dis
posal Solution
MAY USE GERMICIDE
Interceptor Outfalls Properly
Working Says Lynch; Had
Requested Conference
Harrisburg to-day officially asked
the State Health Department for an
extension of time In which to submit
temporary plans for treating sewage
emptying into the Susquehanna river.
The amount of time desired was
not specified.
Co-operation of the State's en
gineering experts on the subject was
reouested.
The city's request was made by
Commissioner \V. H. Lynch, superin
tendent of streets and public improve
ments. to whom Council on Saturday
referred Dr. Samuel <. Dixon's pre
emptory order that Harrisburg Im
mediately submit plans for treating
its sewage in view of the possible
dangers to communities below the
municipality which obtain their wa
ter supplies from the river.
Whether or not the sewage will be
treated with some kind of a germi
cide In the silt basins before the flow
enters the interceptor will be decided
upon after the city confers with the
State Health Department's experts,
according to Commissioner Lynch.
Outlets Working Properly
Harrisburg's sewers drain Into the
city interceptors except in time of
heavy rains when the over-flow carries
it directly into the river. To erect
temporary disposal plants at the sewer
outlets as suggested by Dr. Dixon
would be impossible according to Mr.
Lynch and the only place that a dis
posal plant could be built would lie
at the mouth of the Interceptors. The
commissioner inspected the outlets to
day and declared that they are all
working properly.
The city has never built such a
plant as originally proposed for Rose
bud Island, below thf present dam,
because of lack of funds.
Furthermore Commissioner Lynch
pointed out to-day the city's request
of June 17. 1915, for a conference
with Dr. Dixon, and his engineers to
