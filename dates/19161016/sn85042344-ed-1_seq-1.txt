VIKXXA, Oct. 15. With a keen
lunging for pence has come per
sistent speculation In the central
states as to the manner In which this
blessing may he secured. Hut all
thought on the suhject remains what
It has hecn for nearly two years, the
substance of the person's own wishes.
I'olitionl and military circles today arc
as far from seeing a definite plan for
tlie cessation of the war as they were
When the oastastropho first over
whelmed Europe.
In Merlin and Vienna-they continue
setting their teeth when the word
peace is mentioned, not, booauso war
is wanted, hut for tho reason that up
to tills moment the entente govern
ments have shown no inclination to
cnteriain a meeting on this ground.
Seek Honorable I'oiice.
If the fear prevailed In the central
states that a peace with honor, anil
possibly profit, could not he secured,
owing to military and economic weak
ness, then thought might run In a dif
ferent channc'. Hut that the entente
has not shown that it can ultimately
realize Its own hopes In the universal
lew held In Austria-Hungary and
Germany and their allied countries
The offensive on tho Homme, tho It us -slan
attack In Hukowlna and in east
Galicla, the entry into tho war of Ru
mania and Its Immediate conse
queiiees, tho campaign of Sarrial, from
Salonika and the exertions, of the
Jta'lans, havo nil contributed toward
the feeling In tho central group that
the resistance met by the entente may
yet open tho eyes of those who must
first announco that they will he sntl.v
fied with a peace whose terms will not
be the dismemberment of central Eu
rope as a basis.
To Cnisli llolgliim?
The central governments, so much
may bo said, are ready for a peace
which would leave Europe very much
as before the war with tho exception
that Poland must he an autonomous
state and that neither Helglum nor
Serbia can again trouble. Innocently or
purposoly, the quiet of Europe.
There Is hero not tho faintest Indi
cation that the entente is Inclined to
enter negotiations on that basis. That
being the ease, tho end of tho wai
seems as far off as ever. In Vienna
and Herliii, on tho other hand, nobody
can yet soo why tho central group
should make concessions, since they
claim to hold trumps everywhero by
the occupation of enemy territories so
large that the few advantages of this
onler gained by the entente can hardly
count. Had the summer operation?
driven the central troops out of Era nee
and Russia, things would bo differ
ent. As it is, tho Somnie offensive
has merely shown, according to the
people here, that the steel wall of the
Germans in the west may be belli, but
cannot bo broken, while the troops in
the east have been able to resist the
Russians In a splendid manner, num
bers considered.
The Italians, after making slight
headway along the lsntizo, have again
been obliged to take breath, while in

America Not Satisfied With
Allies Note, Rut "What
Can We Do?"
WASHINGTON. Oct. 15. Exam
ination of the ' allies note on
the censorship of malls, mado public
today, has brought a feeling among
officials that it does not satisfactorily
meet the pretests set loiih In llv
American note of May 24, which said
that "only a radical change restoring
to the I'nited Slates Its full rights as
n 'neutral power, will satisfly this gov.
eminent."
The state department hag watched
with Interest, however, tho Informal
nrrangHiue nts made by British offi
cials through their trade department
und through such conferences us that
of Hlr Richard Crawford In New York
recently, und Is understood to feel
that resentment among American citi
zens over the allied censorship has
been greatly lessened.
It Is thought unlikely that any reply
will be made In the three weeks be
fore election. In this connection diplo
matic circles attach much signifi
cance to President Wilson's declara
tions at Long Rranch yesterday, that
"It !s almost Impossible to do any
thing positive" In the fields of foreign
affairs during the campaign.
All the Information reaching the de
partment is understood to Indicate
that the allies have detormlnod to
maintain the firmest attitude on the
subject, feeling t'.at absolutely Vital
Interests are Involved. Officials ure
said to feel, therefore, that any furth.
er positive step by the United States
might bring the controversy to a much
more critical stage.

NEW VOR1C. Oct. 15. Carefully
prepared Plans of the national
Democratic exj'-utive committee to
extort a campaign fund of several
millions from federal officeholders in
violation of the spirit of the criminal
code and of tho civil service act, wi re
disclosed at Republican national
headquarters today. The plans pur
pose the ra sing of this huge fund for
the re-election of l'rcsident Wilson.
The fr. liners of the plan are per
tly aware of the fact that they are
skating on very thin bo and have
striven to direct the procedure of their I
subordinates so as to enable them to!
effect a substantial violation of the;
law without being caught. The men i
who ale endeavoring lo put the plans
In operation boldly confess to tho sub-
ordlnaten upon whom they rely for
tho actual strong-arm work, that they
are deliberately seeking to evade the
si itutory provisions to which in public,
and for the purposes of campaign nr.
gument only, they make such profuse
profession of devotion.
To Hob I'osliiuisters First.
The first drive of the cash collectors
for the liemocratic committee Is
aimed at postmasters, but It is snecifi
cally set forth that all other federal
appointees as well are expeced to con
tribute to tho Wilson campaign fund.
The amount of the levy upon them is
10 per cent of one year's salary.
The postofflco Appropriation bill,
approved by President Wilson July i!fl
last, carries nil item "for compensa
tion to postmasters, $ 31 ,000.000." If
the Poniocrailc bagmen are only reas
onably successful In holding up post
masters, they can expect to accumu

thousands of dollars. If not millions,

At tho inatanca of National Committeaman

Committee while in New York a few days ago, I am writ
ing to euggeat that you have a private interview with
the pootmaatera In your county who were appointed toy
the pre8ent adtnlnlatratlon, In regard to contributing
to the National Democratic Campaign fund. The names
and salaries cf these appointees are given below.
The National Democratic Executl-ve Committee
is expecting each postmaster, or other federal appointee,
to oontribute to the National Campaign Fund an amount
equal to 10J, of one year's salary. Of course this Is
not compulsory but we are advised that In the event
President Wilson Is re-elected there will be a perma
nent organization of our foroe throughout the country
and a note will be made of the loyalty of those appoint
ees who contributed, as well as of the disloyalty
those who refused to contribute, toward the re-elotlon
of the administration from whom they received their ap
pointments. The civil service law will not permit the
writing, of a letter to a postmaster, demanding money
for campaign purposes, nor will it permit anyone to g
to-.ttw pos toff Ice and request a subscrlpton to the
campaign. But you can sea the postmaster away from hl
plaoe of business and make suoh an appeal to him a I
you would toake to any other Democrat to oontrlUute-'to
the National Democratic Campaign Fund r and can advise
him as to what. the National Committee is expeotlng
of him. hoped that you will proceed Intelli
gently along these lines and arrange In a legal way to
solicit eaoh Democratic postmaster, or other appointed
of the present administration, to contribute to the
Wilson campaign fund, all ofl whom should reallte that

ONE thousand liemocratic voters, or

tion that came to light recently.
There aie rumors of fraud anil con

the fact that national officers are to

any persons perpetrating fraud will

will undoubtedly ensue.
When the ten-day registration period
came lo a close a few mouths ago it
was found that there were less than
llirec hundred more lieinocrats regis

Hut today the leinoeiats have the best

which this increase was made Is the

it Is claimed that certain Individuals

these certificates wero either sent or
mailed to the parties to whom they
were Issued. Others, It Is alleged, wero
left at the office of tho county clerk,
where they wero subsequently called

has clearly been violated. That It w is
