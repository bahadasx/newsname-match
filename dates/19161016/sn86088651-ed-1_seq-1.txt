STATE OFFI
VISIT THE CITY
Dr. W. C. Llncecum and Sanitary En
gineer E. H. Ehlera of Health
Department Here Saturday.
Assistant State Health Officer W.
C. Llncecum and State Sanitary En i
glneer E. H. Enters of Austin spent a
few hours In the city of Bryan lata
Saturday afternoon. These gentle
men were brought to the city by Coun
ty Health Officer' Dr. R. H. Harrison,
with reference to the water that the
citizenship Is now using through the
city water mains. It was the purpose
of Dr. Harrison to have them invest!-.
gate the water to see If same contain
ed any contamination or bacteria.
These gentlemen were given samples '
of the water, and after analyzing
same, announced that while the two
shallow wells operated by the city
poured out as fine quality of water as
could be found In the state, the deep
well which the city Is now forced to
use In connection with the others,
produced a mineral water almost
Identically the same as the-Carlsbad
well at Mineral Wells. These gentle
men said the state could do nothing
to stop the use of the deep well water,
adding there was positively no dan
ger In the water and that if a dyspep
tic would drink a pint of this water
from the deep well after each meal he
would soon cure himself. They stated
further to City Engineer A. S. Adams
that the city of Bryan used a delivery
system for water that waa second to
none In Texas. "From the standpoint
of sanitary conditions, the system
used here Is perfect." declared Dr.
Llncecum, "but as to stopping the as
of the mineral water, that Is a matter
entirely without our Jurisdiction."
Wise men get a lot of free Instruc
tion from fools.
