T! ?? most surprising feature the
? ari paian up t"> date i.- the industrial
upiisinj: iti the State of Ohio. That
State. I.e ause of its varied industries
and rr?-.it wool interests, has been
classed as .t high-tariff citadel. And
only once .'.ince the Civil War, with
the exemption of the election four
ve i' s io, has it cast an electoral
vote for a Democrat. That was in
i 'vwii"!i Cleveland received one of
it twenty-Three electoral votes.
Not o:il\ have the centers of industry
i in Ohio shown a strong leaning toward
tiie President, but even the city of
Cincinnati. with its enormous Merman
population and with a normal rtepuh*
licai majority of i'./mhi tn 20.n0?\ If
a poll of l^.uOO has shown a preference
for Wilson.
The reason assigned for this by < ?hir>
politicians is the fear of the Merman
;>o|oilat on of the deprivation of their
personal riphts, wiilcb include the right
j to drink beer.
j P.oth parties claim Indiana, and the
(postal pulls have ? e: to register their
