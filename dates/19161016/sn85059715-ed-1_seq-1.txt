After the British got the first half
of the redoubt the Germans made
repeated counter attacks to recover
possession of it and for the last week
there had been no cessation of the

SHORTAGE .
Of Coal for the Winter is in
Prospect for City of New
York.
(?v *?aociAtio
i NEW YORK. Oct. Hi. A shortage of
coal is in prospect for this city this
winter, according to the dealers, who
declare their bins are being depleted,
their shipments delayed and that the
outlook for immediate or eventual re
lief is poor. Tho shortage applies to
both hard and soft coal.
Failure to receive the usual amount
of coal- is attributed to a scarcity of
labor at tho mines and lack of cars for
transportation, the latter of which is
said |to be most serious, due to tho
movement of war munitions and other
freight for export. Tho enormous for
eign trade is also blamed Tor tho short
ago which, it is stated, exists in other
sections of the country as well as
here.
Prices to New York householders
for stove and nut coal vary from $7 to
$7.75. Dealers declare that with sea
sonable weather tho price will reach
$H before Thanksgiving and thai $!?
coal is not too high to expect at
Ch ristmffs.

i nient the Democrats are resorting to
now a denth blow, when It says "any
agreement entered into by Judge Rob

them only, and not the Republican
voters, who are voting for principlea
and not for this man or that man."
I The Mail nays:
The local Democratic contemporary
publishes In horse bill type a broad
' side in which it purports to print
] letters "which show pledges violated
by Ira B. Robinson" and to disclose
"what actually happened In New
York when General Lilly decided to
abandon the contest to prove that
l Illegal votes were cast for Robinson."
I The further allegation Is made thai
? by Uie compromise agreed on in New
! Yoil "Grant p. Hall was to be made
; chairman of the Republican state^
i committee, that; *Abe Lilly was to be
chairman of the Htate convention,
' that Roltinnon and Lilly were to unite
In drafting a platform, that Gov
ernor Hut Held was not to be given
personal endorsement and the gov
ernor waa to be eliminated from the
conduct of the campaign."
All of which, If true, in Interesting
and no more.
Any agreement entered Into by
Judge Robinson and General Lilly
I concerns them only, and not the Re
publican voter:;, who are voting for
principles and not for this man or
that man. I let ween men as represent

certainly would He with General Lilly 1
and not. with a Democratic newspaper
which would have fought him to the* i
finish had he been the nominee. In
that event. Judge Robinson would
have been the poor abused little boy,
and would have been patted on the j
head by the local Democratic organ'1
and be told nice and pleasant things.
General Lilly Is not kicking. Did
not the distressed old lady on Vir
ginia and Hale read General Lilly's
clarion call for Hughes and Robinson, ^
and the Republican principles, when,
as chairman of that great overflow
meeting in the armory Wednesday
evening, he made a magnificent in
troduction of Charles Evans Hughes?
The question is not whether any
agreement entered Into between
Judge Robinson and General Lilly
could bo carried out?although every
one knows that both gentlemen would
honestly endeavor to carry out such
agreement?but the question Is to
save West Virginia from the blight
of a Democratic administration. That
is the real Issue, and not what may; ;
