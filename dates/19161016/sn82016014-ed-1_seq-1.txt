That's Optimistic Sensation of

Big Boost by Kail Chiefs En

LonR Branch, N. J.. Oct. 16. State
ments by F. D. Underwood, president
of the F.rie railroad, and Robert S.
Lovett, chairman of the board of the
I'nion Pacific railroad, endorsing
President Wilson and disputing claims
that the president acted with political
expediency when he forced thru con
press the Adamson eight-hour law. is
the best news which has struck Shad
ow Lawn in some days, the president's
political lieutenants declared today.
While the big railroad chiefs disagree
with the president on the eigrht-hour
law. their support of the so-called
Wilson policy now under Republican
fire is taken by Democratic leaders
here as strong indication that the sub
stantial business interests of the coun
try are finally swinging into line be
hind the president. They look for
further announcement by other lead
ing railroad men similar to those of
Underwood and Lovett.
Others Adopt 8-Hour Day.
Action by several big business con
cerns in the country, notably the En
dicott & Johnson shoe manufactory,
in not only indorsing, but actually put
ting into effect tin eight-hour day, is
held by the president's advisers as in
dicative that society approves the
principle of the eight-hour day as
claimed by the president and that his
means of settling the threatened rail
road strike are "obviously being vin
dicated." Party leaders here who two weeks
ago were dubious, today are literally
walking on air. They feel the slump
has passed and that "Hughes will
never be able to catch up again."
Their views are based on scores of
telegrams coming in from their aides
k11' over the country and contribu
tions amounting to something like
$20.00u a day are materially boosting
their optimism. During the last five
days $150,000 were rung up in Dem
ocratic cash registers.

A FRIEND TO MAN

Dies in Kansas City.
He Helpad More Than 7,000
Convicts Back to Life.
FOUNDED SOCIETY IN TOPEKA
"National Society for Friend
less" Organized Here.
Considerable Prison Reform
Thru His Efforts.
The Rev. Edward A. Fredenhagen,
known throughout the country as a
pioneer in prison reform, the friend
who helped more than 7,000 convicts
back onto the straight road and to
honest employment, died after mid
night today in Kansas City, Kan.
Doctor Fredenhagen was the foun
der and general superintendent for
Kansas and Missouri of the National
Society for the Friendless, which with
the help of his wife he organized in
Topeka some sixteen years ago. The
society originated in the family home
of Mr. and Mrs. Fredenhagen, who for
years kept their home open to all
classes of ex-prisoners. It expanded
so that it required several homes to
care for the prisoners.
The Rev. Edward FredenliMRen, "the
convicts' friend, who died today.
In 1905 the twork had become of
such magnitude that the national so
ciety was founded which at Dresent in-
ciuaes twelve western states. I

ing lived here until 1910. when the
increasing scope of their work re
quired their removal to Kansas City,
Missouri.
In the years since the organization
of the society more than 7,000 convicts
have been helped to self support. To
day those who have been helped by
the society are earning a total annual
average of more than three quarters
of a million dollars in honest emDlov-
ment. But a comparatively small per
cent of those helped have slipped back
into crime.

efforts that such important measures I tne attacks of his critics. Field Mar

teen years ago and the simple creed
resulted jn the saving to society of
thousands of criminals. For years the
work was carried on by the private
means of Fredenhagen and his wife,
and the gifts of a few friends. When
the national society was finally
brought into existence he accepted
only a pittance in the -way of salary
for his efforts.
The activities of the Society of the
Friendless are in five departments: A
department of educating the people in
the causes of crime and securing pre
ventive legislation ; the promotion of
criminal reform; personal and organ
ized evangelistic effort in prisons; the
operation of temporary homes for
friendless ex-prisoners and the fur
nishing of a new start in life for the
released prisoners.
The funeral will be held Wednesday
afternoon in Kansas City, Kan. The
Topeka members of the board of di
rectors, V. O. Coe. D. F. Shirk and
Judge T. F. Carver, president of the
Kansas-Missouri division of the so
ciety, will attend the funeral and the

Allies in Campaign Against
Peace at Washington.
WHAT IS METHOD FOR PEACE?
Unprecedented Problem Be
cause of Widespread War.
Editor Outlines Three Demands
Germany Makes.
Cologne, Oct. 16. "If those fellows
make peace only when Germany is
'knocked out,' then we will never
make peace.'
This emphatic declaration came to
day from Ernest Posze, chief editor
of the Cologne Gazette and probably
Germany's greatest editor. His thirty
two years connection with that pow
erful journal makes him perhaps the
best unofficial spokesman of the em
pire, in replying to Lloyd George's re
cert statement that the war must go
on to a finish.
"For weeks, the allies have con
ducted a press campaign against peace
especially at Washington," said Posze.
"They have said repeatedly that there
will be no peace unil we are broken,
until they reach the Rhine.
"These statements have strength
ened our positions enormously. In
my opinion the military situation is
better today than it was a year ago.
The allies will never be able to break
the west front, while the situation on
other fronts may improve. The peo
ple are filled with confidence in Hin
denburg." Can Wilson Bring Peace?
, "Can" President Wilson make
peace?" he was asked.
"This war is so enormous that the
methods for bringing peace which ap
plied formerly do not apply today,"
he replied. "An international con
gress cannot settle it. The only plan
is for Wilfon, thru ambassadors to
suggest that special envoj-s meet in
Washington but I do not believe this
would succeed now. The allies want
peace on their own terms, which we
certainly will not consider. Here, as
elsswhere, there are paace-at-any-price
folk, but the German people as
a whole want peace only when we
can exist as a nation."
Three things, the Gazette editor con
siders essential to peace, so far as
Germany is concerned.
First, the military situation must be
considered, he said. Germany must
follow Bismarck's policy of protecting
her western boundary. Derhans hv tak
ing the French fortess of Belfort and

Second, Germany must develop and

that she will no longer be dependent

tries so she can exist in the event of j

RACE QUESTION UP
Debate Establishing Negro
Episcopal Dioceses.
Triennial Church Conference
Discusses Clergy Pension.
St. Louis, Oct. 1 6.- Debater on a
proposal to establish a racial Epis
copate was on ihe calendar today
from the house of deputies, the lower
body of the Protestant Episcopal con
vention in session here. tl is pro
posed to amend the church constitu
tion to authorize the creation of dio
ceses of negro churches, presided over
by negro bishops, and the removal of
negro parishes from the supervision
of the present white diocesan heads.
The question, one of the most im
portant to come before the conven
tion, has been discussed for a decade.
and six years ago resulted in the pass-
age of an amendment permitting the
election of the negro assistant bishops
in the various dioceses. Church lead
ers admit a wide difference of opinion.
It is argued that tne creation of
negro dioceses would make more
sharp the Une of cleavage between the
races, while on the other hand it i3
asserted that such action would en
able the negro to keep more easily his
racial identity. mat tne present law
I J- effectual is evinced by the fact
t that in the six years since the last
! amendment no negro suffragan bish-
ops have been chosen.
Announcement was made that the
i "use of bishops, the upper body, will
meet with the house of deputies late
today to consider a pension plan for
clergymen. An effort is now being
made in the church to raise $5,000,000
i as a pension reserve fund.

TROOPS AT RILEY
First Kansas To Be Mustered
Out in Two Weeks.
Second Regiment Expected to
. Arrire Next Sunday.
Fort Riley, Oct. 16. The second
and third sections of the First infan
try regiment, Kansas National Guard,
detrained here early today, after hav
ing spent the night in - the sleeping
cars in the railroad yards at the mili
tary reservation and at once went into
camp. The first section detrained yes
terday after its long trip from San
Antonio and spent the night under
canvas.
The second and third sections did
not arrive here ur.til after darkness
had set in and it was decided by the
commanding officers not to attempt to
make camp un;.-'l today. Consequently
supper was prepared in the train cars
and the troopers remained in the
train over night.
Plans are being made for the re
turn of the Second infantry later this,
week, after its stav on the border, and
it is proposed to make next Sunday a
state picnic day on tne grounds, uov
ernor Capper and other state officials
are expected to be here and visitors
from all sections -it Kansas are invited
to come here that day to view the
state troops.
Men in Good Health.
The First regiment was busy pre
paring its camp today. Using the ex
perience gained in the months on the
frontier, the tents went up with lit
tle confusion and long before night it
was expected the sun-tanned Kansan3
would have completed their camp.
Regimental records showed the men
in excellent health, a fact their looks
bore out. All said they were glad to
get back to Kansas.
Seven hundred ind twenty-three
men and fifty-one officers of the First
Kansas, commanded by Colonel Wild
er S. Metcalf, are encamped here. Not
one member of the regiment was lost
by death since the guard mobilized.
Only one man, Andrew Mason, of
Kansas City, a member of A company,
was left behind because of illness.
Muster Out in Two Weeks.
The First regiment probably will
remain here about two weeks, Ad
jutant General Martin said. The length
of the time will be required for the
physical examinations preparatory to
mustering out and for taking the
"finger print" records which are made
of all soldiers in the federal service.
Three officers of the regular anriy
medical corps accompanied The regi
ment from San Antonio to superin
tend the physical examinations.
The men will be returned to their
homes by companies as fast as -the
mustering out is completed. The First
regiment is said to be the only Na
tional Guard regiment which has left
the border taking with it its supply
company. The supply companies of
the other militia units which have left
the border, all have had to remain to
"clean up," munitions and property.
The entire equipment of the supply
company of the regiment, including
all the horses and mules, issued to it
by the government, was loaded on the
train which arrived today.
Need Fire to Keep Warm.
The Kansans having grown accus
tomed to the heat and sunshine of
southern Texas tound the chilly
weather today uncomfortable and the
squads detailed to the work of making
camp frequently were permitted to
leave their labors long enough 'o
warm themselves at stoves set up in
tents. The First did little cheering
today, some of Ihe troopers declaring
to newspaper men that they regretted
returning at this time. Several spoke
of the fact that they would be with
out positions when they went back to
their home stations.

COAL FAMINE FOR N. Y.
Poor Old Gotham Has Brand of Win
ter Grief.
New Tork, Oct. 16. A shortage of
coal is in prospect for this city this
winter, according to the dealers who
declare their bins are being depleted,
their shipments delayed and the out
look for Immediate or eventual relief
is poor. The shortage applied to both
hard and soft coal.
Failure to receive the usual amount
of coal is attributed to a scarcity of
labor at the mines and lack of cars for
transportation, the latter of which 13
said to be most serious due to the
movement of war munitions and other
freight for export.
Prices to New York householders
for stove and nut coal vary from 17
to (7.75. Dealers declare that with
seasonable weather the price will
reach $8 before Thanksgiving and that

Will Baise Issue at the Xext
Session of Congress.
New York, Oct 1. Robert T. Fra
zier. Jr., of Nashville. Tenn.. chair
man of the organization of the 80 per
cent of railway employes not members
of the brotherhoods, and who are not
benefited by the Adamson wage in
crease bill, has made an exhaustive re
port to those he represents, which
condemns the president in polite but
not the less severe terms and which
tears the mask from what Mr. Wilson
persists in calling an "eight hour bill."
"We are very much opposed to the
legislation as enacted," reads Mr. Fra
zier's report, "an 1 to President Wil
son's recommendations to the con
gress, which altogether ignore our
rights and sacrifice our chances of
betterment in order to grant a tre
mendous increase of wages to othar
men already receiving double our av
erage wage. We are pushing forward
with determination and expect to pre
sent at the next session of congress n
strenuous appeal for a full and Just
investigation of ths whole railway sit
uation." Wilson Dodged Them.
Referring to the visit of himself and
P. W. Walden to Washington at th
time the president was handling the
railway controversy, Mr. Frazier re
cites the daily, persistent efforts they
made to see the president, pointing
out that never waj Mr. Wilson's dar
fully occupied wi'h the controversy,
but, says Mr. Frazier. "altho the
president was holding lengthy confer
ences daily with the brotherhood
leaders he would not receive your rep
resentatives even for a few minutes,
present to him the petition signed by
1,500,000 railway employes, and n .
ask for Justice for the remainder ef
the unorganized 80 per cent. ,
i-The president persisted in his de
termination to secure the 1 S per cent
increase, disguised as an 'elsht hour
day,' for the 350,000 brother mem
bers, and to give no consideration to
the interests of the other 1,500,000
lailway employes."
Want All It- K. Wage Probed.
In a statement to the press Mr. Fra
zier says:
"We are now preparing petitions
asking congress to investigate the en
tire subject-of railway and compensa
tion. The Adamson law simply raised
the wages of the highest paid class of
railway employes. We, the 80 per
cent outside the brotherhoods, certain
ly are opposed to any advances to
these men if they militate against ad
vances to the lower paid employes. Jn
a word, if there is to be 1 gislation on
the subject of compensation we want
it to cover the whole field fairly and
equitably."
