says the Overseas News. "The
Rumanian first army and the
larger part of the' second army
were virtually annihilated

The Rumanians planned
to send a second army to the

but the second army advanced

forced to retreat in haste, and
its retreat became a panicky
flight," continues the state

The large audience which packed

the Tightwad" went expecting to hear
the "money grabber" taken, to a skin

with humorous hits at the expense of
men who live for self alone, yet will
long to profit by the generosity of
others. The essence of the lecture,
however, was of a more serious vein.
He exhorted his audience not to be
niggardly with the church, the biggest
and the best institution in the com
munity. Don't bo a tightwad with
your community spirit, Boost to the
limit. Bury your hammer and get a
horn. Don't withhold tho use of your
talents from the community. Don't
be stingy with your personal influ
ence, love and sympathy, and words
of appreciation and encouragement.
The speaker paid a glowing tribute to
Ardniore and Carter county and made
an earnest plea for larger efforts to
make it grow. The most eloquent
part of the lecture, however, was its
fervent tribute to 'mother" as the em
bodiment of all those good and unself
ish things that the tightwad Is not.
After the lecture the chancel was
crowded by appreciative friends who
congratulated the speaker on this, tho
second lecture he has given while in
the city. Mr. Welch, we learn pri
vately, has opportunities to devote his
time to the Chautamiua platform at a
large salary but has declined In favor
of the pulpit.

Where Austria-Hungary, iioumania

gates" which barred navigation until
a channel was opened in 1896. The
Danube, which is second only to the
Volga among European rivers, makes
two sharp turns there, changing its
course from northeast to south to
southwest. The "iron gates" are con
trolled by the Roumanians. On the
Hungarian side Is the town of Orso

Severin. "At Orsova (on the Danube
near the Hungarian-Roumanian front

Mackensen. the famous German gen

THE GREATEST INDUSTRY IN
THE STATE MADE A TARGET
BY THE POLITICIANS.
WILL KILL INDUSTRY
Unless Curbed Tax Grabbers Will
Drive Oil Operators to Adjoining
States.
Those politicians who controlled tho
last legislature of tho state of Okla
homa Blngled out the oil producers for
goats. Those who are engaged in de
veloping the most hazardous industry
in tho statu have had imposed upon
them unjust taxation. The legisla
tors were possessed with the same
crude instincts as tho ancient abo
rigines who looked no further than
the advancement of their immediate
tribe, and were not broad-minded
enough to know that crushing the
greatest industry In the slate is det
rimental to tho welfare of all the
people In Oklahoma. They have not
advanced far enough In broad Intelli
gence yet to know that the upbuild
ing of this great Industry and cen
tralizing it here is of vast Importance
and benefit to all the people in the
slate, no matter whore they resldo.
Oil producers pay Into the state
treasury 30 mills on the dollar of their
receipts for tho sale of the oil pro
duced. Under the budget of 1917 oth
er classes of property will pay into
the state treasury two mills on the
dollar, based upon tne aevalorem ba
sis. It Is true that a small portion
of this 30 mills is paid back into the
counties for school and good road
purposes, though the amount is noth
ing compared to what would be avail
able for township, school district and
county government if the oil produc-
ers tax was paid the same as other
taxes are paid, and appropriated In the
same manner.
Only State Having This Method.
No other state in the Union has un
dertaken such a high-handed method
of levying tribute from one single in
dustry. Tho people in the non-oil-de
veloped part of the state should Join
in opposing this method of taxation
for the professional politicians are
an avaricious lot. It Is hard to
tell how soon their appetite will call
for a production tax on broom corn,
cotton, cotton seed oil, packing house
and manufacturing products. As a
matter of fact it Isn't good statesman
ship to take away the oil taxes and
appropriate them to the exclusion of
the localities paying the tax. County
and local governments have to be
maintained In tho oil country and the
oil tax ought to help maintain this
necessary expense. Besides it Is
Bad Financial Policy.
Three refineries locating Just across
the line in Kansas recently which will
be fed by Oklahoma crude; transport
ing storage oil to Kansas and other
states where oil men have a few
rights left; the tearmg down and
abandonment of great tank farms; the
removal from the state of late of our
wealthiest men, shows wnat tho short
sighted policies arc bringing about
in tills state.
Bad Economics Too.
This policy is unsound, for oil de
velopment helped principally to the
upbuilding of the magnificent cities
lof Bartlesvllle, Muskogee, Vlnlta, Ok
mulgee, Ponca City, Sapulpa, Ard
niore and Tulsa. It is putting renew
ed life and vigor in Biackwell. Enid
and Perry, and Oklahoma City is feel
ing the dynamic force of the oil men.
The upbuilding of them? crtles has cre
ated a market for the farmers and.
they too, indirectly are partners aand
derive great benefits from the produc
tion of oil. Is the progress of these
cities to be retarded and paliscd by the
machination of brazen demagogues?
Shall Grant. Woodward, Major, Cus
ter, Kiowa and all the rest of western
Oklahoma counties wait for oil rea
to turn loose millions in their midst

demagogues run their course, or win
