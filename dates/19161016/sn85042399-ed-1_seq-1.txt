the words of ona of the party, "Is a
millionairess in her inheritance of a

ing women an enthusiastically royal
reception. Fully three thousand peo
ple gathered in Lithia park to hear
the visitors, and over a hundred cars
met the delegation at the depot.
Marred By Discourtesy.
The afternoon was slightly marred,
however, by the discourtesy shown
by a number of Wilson partisans,
who apparently forgot that Ashland
was hostess to these visitors, that
Ashland stood to gain or to lose her
reputation as an entertainer royal, after burst of enthusiastic applause,
that the Civic Improvement Club, re-! Mrs. D. Perozzi, chairman of the lo
gardless of politics, had made a big cal Hughes Alliance, introduced the
effort to greet the visitors with a
profuslon of fruit, flowers and hos
pitality, that common courtesy and
fairness demand a hearing of the
"other fellow's" side uninterrupted
by hoodlum yells. A number of cars j part in the suffrage work In New

"How beautiful," "You are too

Klamath Falls
Ties Medford
The Klamath Falls football ma
chine held Medford high's hopefuls
to a 13 to 13 tie Saturday, and the
' prospects for the toughest kind of
: a four-cornered race for the Souths
j em Oregon championship loom sure.
; Klamath must have a fast, husky
I bunch to hold the heavy Medford
' team to a tie. Grants Pass shows
I the best team of years and Ashlnnd
j must be reckoned as having the best
balanced team ever turned out of the
local school. Local fans are anx
iously awaiting the first game here
In order to get a glimpse of the home
boys In action. Interest Is rising
fast and a season of games, none
onesided and every one a thriller, Is
promised. Medford and Klamath
both played fast ball, according to
reports from across the mountains.
The scores were due to fumbles, in
the main.
Corner Position
Lost First Prize
D. M. Lowe, who took the Jackson
county exhibit to the state fair at
I Salem tills year and won third place
! among the counties of Oregon, states
j that the position allotted the county
I is all that lost Jackson county first
place. He states that tills county
j was only two and a half points be
hind first place and that arrange
ment was the weak point and that
that feature was Impossible In the
out-of-the-way corner which fell to
! his lot. However, Mr. Lowe states
I that he has already started arrange-
ments for next year so that this dls
j trlct will be assured of a good place.
An organization of county exhib
itors was made and agreement reach
ed on a number of features which
were demanded and granted by the
fair board and will be in effect next
year. Among them will be a new
system of scoring. Score cards will
be sent out to each county three
months in advance so that the exhib
its may be planned with reference to
every point which means a high
score. Another feature is a prize of
a substantial cash amount for the
county which makes the best display
of its best resources. Thus Jackson
could feature apples, pears, alfalfa
and the like; Tillamook, cheese and
dairy products, and so on. There
will be f(ie fruit awards next year
jand Jackson growers will have an
i Incentive for greater effort,
j Mr. Lowe did not take his exhibit
i on up to the Seattle land show as at
first planned. No guarantee could
be found for anything and he did not
wish to lay the county liable to a
debt of several hundred dollars In
case his fears regarding the stabil
ity of the show proved true. '
Mr. Lowe states that he was ad
vised by the governor to take his
exhibit to the Dry Farming Congress
which is to be held In Texas this
year. Mr. Lowe's one farm exhibit
Is always a prize winner at dry farm
shows, and the state executive be
lieved he could gain much more fume
for Oregon and Jackson county
there than at the Seattle show.
Apple Measures
Fourteen Inches
An apple measuring fourteen Inch
es In circumference Is on exhibition
In the Commercial Club window.
The apple is from the home place of
F. II. Walker. While others may
grow as large, Mr. Walker says ho
has to see them.
C. B. Lamkin Moves
Real Estate Office
C. B. I.amkln has moved his real
estate office from the room near the
public market to the office room In
the building botween the Citizens
bank and the Vienna bakery. This
was formerly occupied by the Con
way company when they were doing
business in Ashland and has since
housed one or two real estate con
cerns. Mr. Lamkin is making a bus
iness like looking place out of the
room and Is preparing to meet the
business which he is sure is coming
next spring.
The baker, of course, Is out for the

Approaching the Interest In the
