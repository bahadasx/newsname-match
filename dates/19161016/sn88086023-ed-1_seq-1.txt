WILSON WINNER .
OF HERALD POLL
NEW YORK. Oct. 16 presi-
dent Wilson'i re-election by a
large majority Is again fore
shadowed by last week's result
of the New York Herald's poll.
With 107,403 straw votes as a
basis, the states which the Her-
aid puts In the Wilson column
have 212 electoral votes, while
only 266 are required to elect.
The Herald gays that the repub
licans aeem to be at a standstill
while the democrats are forging
ahead.
The Herald declares that New-
York, Illinois, Ohio and Indiana
will decide the election and ad-
mlts that Hughes' possible plur.
allty In Ohio is under 10,000 f
while Wilson is leading in New
York.
A special dispatch from Bos-
ton to the Herald today gays:
"Wilson sentiment la growing 9
alarmingly."
The Telegram, evening edition
of the Herald, probably- the most
rabid anti-Wilson organ in New 4
York, says today under the head-
lng, "Campaign Slump Worries
Leaders of Republicans:"
"That fear of the loss of the
labor vote has added to other
causes of apptehenslon, among
the republicans, and that with
the presidential" election less
than four weeks off, republican
managers admit that the ram-
paign, so far as the republican
party la concerned, has struck
4 a slump."

Harry Minnis. who recently resign
ed from the Pendleton fire depart
ment to accept a position in the gov
ernment secret service, figured in a
shooting episode at Lapwai, Idaho
Saturday morning, according to press
dispatches. Minnis and his senior of
ficer, C. H. Hanson, had arrested
George Weeks and Lou Stevens at a
breaking up of a dance, the charge
against them being introducing liquor
on a reservation.
Fred Stevens, a brother of the
other, interfered and was shot
through the left breast by Hanson.
Hanson went to the Iipwal Indian
agency Immediately, and Minnis en
tered the hotel. A mob compo-ed ot
friends of Stevens quickly formed, but
Minnis made his escape out of a rear
door of the hotel and to the Indian
agency. Ilefore the whereabouts of
the officers were discovered they ha.
been placed In an automobile and
started for Lewlston, a distance of 11
miles.
The contention of the officers is
that they placed Weeks under arrest
and that his friends endeavored to
effect his rescue. Weeks was arrest
ed at Uipwai later and taken to lew
lston to answer to the charge.
Officers Hanson and Minnis nre
remaining In Lewlston, awaiting the

HASTINGS. Nebr.. Oct. 16. Can
didate Hughes has answered President
Wilson's "invisible government"
charges. He addressed two thousand.
"Those discussing the invisible gov
ernment should remember there was
no Invisible government In New York
state during my governorship." He
declared Wilson Ignored the farm
er's plea for consideration before the
enactment of the Adamson law and
read a telegram from the farmers to
the administration asking for a full
hearing before taking any action tend
ing to increase the freight rates.
"I oppose that sort of government.
It has no regard for farming com
munities. It's idle talk about having
the farmers' Interest" at heart when
congress over night levels such blow
at the Interests of our agricultural
communities."
"The farmers protested in time but
were not represented In .the discus
sion and not represented In the sur
render to the railroaders.
"No regard was paid the farmers'
message. The nation's businessmen
through the chambers of commerce
repeatedly implored the executive and

WILL TRY TO DOUBLE
COUNTY SCHOOL TAX
Purpose Is to Lower Locttl Tax to
More Populous Districts sod Uakm
Outlying Land Y.cld More Revenue.
An effort is being made to double
the county tax fot school purposes to
the end that the local tax in the more
populous districts will be lowered and
the outlying land, now but little tax
ed for school purposes or not at all
shall be made to yield more revenue
for the education of the youth of ths
county.
The movement originated In Mil to a
with. Principal John B. Washburn,
wno recently addressed all patroLS
and taxpayers of trie Milton-Freewa-tr
district with circular letters bear
n.g on the subject. County Super
.mendent Young put the matter up to
tne county court recently and it Is
understood that Assessor Strain alio
favors it. At the county directors' in
Mltute'held here last March the prop
osition was unanimously approved.
It Is pointed out that the district
school taxes are heavy, especially in
the cities and towns. The county
school tax has been 1 1-2 mills ami
the funds thus derived have been di
vided among the districts at the rate
oi $iCu each district outright and su
much per capita for the school chil
dren In the district.
The doubling uf the county tax
would give each district double tti
amount now received Thus Miltun
Froewater now gets 18500 from tht
ctunty and, with the double tax, would
receive IK, nou. To raise th much
additional by a district tax would re
quire a five mill levy. Here In Pen
dleton It is figured that the increase
oi the county school tux 1 1-2 uiilis
f.tuld lower the district tax thru
nulls, a net saving of 1 1-2 mills
However, the tax on the less popu
lous dL-trlcts would be Increased.
Tins, however, is no moie than juiine
in the. opinion or the advn all uf tho
movement, because liiiny farmers
take their cliuuren to th towns to
educate them but have their property
behind.
The county court has su'iriiiUr.J
the proposition to DUtnct Atluinuy
Meiwer for a leal opinion. l'o faute

would prolaul be iereiur because
of the limitation plated by law upon
