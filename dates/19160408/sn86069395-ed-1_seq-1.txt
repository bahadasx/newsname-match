More than $40,000 was paid out
this week for 600,000 pounds of to
bacco sold on the loose floors at an
average of more than $7. It was the
best sale of the year, with heavy re
ceipts, but all of the tobacco was not
owned by the farmers. Much of it
was resold at a handsome profit, giv-
ing the rehandlers their first taste of
prosperity for a long time. As a re
suit there is an air of general optim
ism prevailing on all sides.
The sales are now 50 per cent
greater than they were this time last
year and only two millions short of

of the Government's most efficient
poultry experts.
His last visit hero was spent in go
ing over the county with Mr. Casey
in tho interest of the adult work.
Three flocks of Whito Wyandottes
were Inspected and theso flocks were
recommended by Prof. Slade as be
ing up to standard and worthy of be
ing used in tho extension work.
Prof. Slade will go with Mr. Chapin

DON FEATHERS OF WAR
To Be Led By "Peaches,"
Famous Old Scout of 30
Years Ago.
Columbus, N. M., April 7. Twen
ty Apache Indian scouts are prepared
to start today to Gen. Pershing's
headquarters at San Geronimo ranch
to take up the trail of Francisco Villa.
With thaarrival here of their moun
tain ponies, they will cross the bor
der for the trip through the desert.
They slept last night ontheground,
and not as they did Wednesday night
on the floor of a railroad sleeping
car, the berths of which were unfa
miliar and not to their liking. Only
the arrival of "Peaches," described
as premier scout and trailer of the
Apaches, was needed to complete
their happiness in the prospect of
taking the warpath again after more
than thirty years of civilization, ac
cording to their interpreter.
"Peaches" was in the mountains
and word did not reach him in time
to start with the others from the
White Mountain Apache reservation
in Arizona. However, the men said
that "Peaches" probably is riding
hard in an attempt to reach Cqlumbus
before the border is crossed.

CARRANZA HINTS
U. S. TO RETIRE
Said to Have Suggested That
Villa's "Hot Trail" Has
Grown Cold.
Washington, April 7. In the ab
sence of further news of fighting in
Mexico between the American forces
and Villa bandits, attention of officials
here has centered upon the diplomatic
aspect of the punitive expedition.
Information of the war and state
departments regarding use of the
Mexican railways to ship supplies to
Gen. Pershing was conflicting. The
war department had no reports indi
cating that Carranza authorities at
Juarez had received orders to accept
shipments from Gen. Funston. Sec
retary Lansing at the state depart
ment, however, said he understood
such orders had been issued.
Mr. Lansing also declared he
thought the difficulty was physical,
not political, and was due largely to
the disorganized condition of the roll
ing stock and roadbed of the Mexi
can Northwestern.
CARRANZA SUGGESTS A RE
TIREMENT. Some officials still were inclined to
connect the delay in permitting the
use of the railroads with a desire on
the part of Carranza to see the Amer
ican soldiers back on their own terri
tory. Already, it is understood the
de facto government officials on the
border have made informal inquiries
as to how much longer the expedi
tion will remain in Mexico and how
much further southward it expects to
penetrate. As legally the United
States now is pursuing a "hot trail,"
it would occasion no gfceat surprise
here if Carranza should suggest soon
that the trail had gotten cold and
questioning the propriety st the
United States proceeding much farth

MAY BANQUET
POSTPONED
Athenaeum's Open Meeting
to be Held a Week
Later.
MEETING HELD THURSDAY
Frank Rives Elected Presi-
dent and A. H. Eckles
Vice President.
The Athenaeum held a most inter
esting meeting at Hotel Latham
Thursday night.
As several members were attending
a wedding in the early part of the
evening, the program was taken up
after the business session was held.
The Banquet Committee reported
that Hotel Latham could not serve the
banquet on May 4, owing to the Pres
byterian Laymen's meeting, which
would tax the hotel to its utmost capac
ity on that date. A recommendation
that it be postponed until May 11th
was adopted.
The program committee submitted
the following speakers and tentative
subjects:
Rev. C. M. Thompson. "In Pass
ing;" H. W. Linton, "Some Words;"
Geo. E. Gary, "Rhyme and Reason;"
Ira L. Smith, (to be selected); T. C.
Underwood, "The Periscope."
The one vacancy in the member
ship was filled by the election of Dr.
T. W. Perkins.
The evening's program consisted
of two excellent papers.
T. C. Underwood wrote on "The
World's Humor," it being a captivat
ing story ofthc lighter side of lifefrom
Samson and his foxes to Irvin Cobb
J and his Judicious stories. It was a
splendid paper in Mr. Underwood's
best vein, sparkling throughout with
the brightness of his own humor,
Mr. Frank Rives taking "Mexico"
as his topic gave a resume of the tur
bulent history of poor Mexico, start
ing what turned out to be an animat
ed debate on the question of inter
vention and the occupancy of the J
country, permanently if necessary to
civilize it.
Messrs. Chas. M. Meacham, Geo.
E. Gary, John Stites, L. E. Foster,
A. H. Eckles, Dr, Austin Bell and
Mr. Rives advocated the takincr of
Mexico by the United States, while
Messrs. A. H. Clark. Ira D. Smith.
Pettus White and Rev. J. N. Jessun
took the other side and argued that
we had no just grounds for interven
tion, the massacre at Columbus being
less a provocation for war than the
destruction by Germany of American
lives on the Lusitania. The question
was in the end left for President Wil
son to settle.
New officers were elected as fol
lows: Frank Rives, President; A. II.
Eckles, Vice President; II. W. Lin
ton, re-elected Secretary.
Mr. Rives will be Toastmaster at
the coming banquet.
Those present were: Frank Rives,
II. W. Linton, L. E. Foster, Dr. A.
Bell, A. H. Clark, L. H. Davis, Rev.
J. N. Jessup, Ira L. Smith, A. II.
Eckles, John Stites, T. C. Under

Gary, Ira D. Smith, Pettus White.

KAISER AGAIN
L
Germans Also Seek to Retake
Trences Lost to the
British
I KAISER WON HAUC0URT
British Troops Continue Ad
vance Against Turks In
Mesopotamia.
Not only have the Germans been in
heavy fighting with the French around
Verdun, but they have launched a
strong attack against the new British
positions near St. Eloi, which lies a
few miles south of Yprcs, in an en
deavor to regain 6000 yards of tren
ches which the British won from
them ten days ago.
There have been gains on both Ger
man and French sides. The Ger
mans captured the village of Hau
court, which lies in the Avocourt
Bethincourt sector to the nerthwest
of Verdun. This is considered by
the Germans as an important strategic
point, for while the French held it
the Germans could not cross tho
Forges brook.
The French claim that this village
is dominated by the French guns.
On their sides the French forces
carried a large section of the position
north of Avocourt known as the Bois
Carre, and in severe hand-to-hand
fighting south of Fort Douaumont
drove the Germans back through
their underground passages for a dis
tance of 200 meters along a front of
500 meters. They succeeded, also, by
their curtain of fire in preventing an
assault on the Cote du Poivre, to the
east of the Meuse, which the Germans
had subjected to a long and intense
bombardment.
The French war officers officially
announces that during the month of
March a total of thirty-five German
aeroplanes were destroyed and that
the Freneh aerial losses amounted to
only thirteen aeroplanes. This is
doubtless in reply to the German
statement recently issued to the effect
that in March the British and French
lost forty-four aeroplanes, while the
Germans lost only 14.
Another town in Mesopotamia, Fela
hie has been captured by the British,
which brings the relieving forces
nearer to Kut-El-Amara, where Gen.
Townshend and his command luvo
been beleaguered for many months.
The capture of Felahie was preceded
by a succession of assaults on the en
trenched position on the Turks at
Umma-El-Henna, the Turks being
driven out of five lines of trenches.
A Spanish cabinet council has been
called to consider the question of the
torpedoing of Spanish vessels.
A German submarine has been
sunk by a squadron of French and
British warships, the crew being cap
tured. The British steamers Zent
and Vcsuvio also have been sent to
the bottom. Forty-eight members of
the crew of the Zent aro mis ing.
Three of the survivors of the Vesuvio
were injured.
TO TRAIN SOLDIERS.
At least 30,000 moil are expected
to avail themselves of the onnortunitv
afforded for military training in nino
camps to be conducted under the gen
eral supervision of tho United Stites
army this spring and summer. The
camps will bo located at Fort Ogle
