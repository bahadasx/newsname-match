VERDICT CIVEN
Celebrated Youmans' Suit Is His­
tory Minot Man Has No
Case.
COMPLAINANT IS
SEVERELY SCORED
Banking Board Officers Acted
Within Powers in Closing
Institution.
Minot, April 7.—Willi a verdict in
favor of the defendants, the celebrat­
ed Youmans case came to an abrupt
end Friday afternoon at Minot. Judge
Knoesiiuu, who has bean Ihe trial
judge in directing I lie verdict, made
a statement to the effect that the
state ollicials could not be blamed as
they had simply acted as slate olli­
cials and had no ulterior motives in
closing the bank's doors.
Scores Complainant.
In his statement to tlie jury, Judge
Kneesliaw scathingly denounced liie
complainant for having secured the
signatures of farm lianas who possess­
ed no property. The entire business
was considered fraudulent and on ac­
count of that the bauking board offic­
es acted entirely within their prov­
ince when they ordered an accounting
or liquidation of the bank, and also
the officials, therefore, could not be
held responsible for damages.
Audience Demonstrative.
The demonstrations of the audience
in favor of the complainant, was ac­
cording to reports, disgustingly parti­
san and wholly un-American. "Such
disagreeable proceedings on the part
of the spectators, were never seen in
a court of justice before," said the
judge. "I don't know who they are,
but they must be depraved and have
depraved minds. Such people who
would trample our beautiful flag, with
its stars and stripes, underfoot, are
,.,not entitled jo. live in any commun­
ity," concluded the speaker.
General Satisfaction.
The many people, (outside those
who have been, wholly prejudiced in
favor,0f the plaintiff) were well satis­
fied -^itli the turn the case had, taken,
\yUen tiiey learned that a directed ver­
dict in favor of the defendant? had
been gj#en. ...The. spectators sat sil-
v,,ent
a.pcLtjhe keenest attention was di
^^Kep^i,Toward tliei bencji when Judge
Kneeshaw said, irv conclusion, "Now,
gentlemen, I am here, and I am not
afraid of any living soul nor afraid
of any anarchist in this crowd or in
this city I am prepared to do my duty
before Almighty God, and they can't
frighten or bulldoze me."
Unfair Misstatements.
The conduct of Grant S. Youmans
and his attorney, Manahan, was de­
nounced as the worst that the judge
had ever come across in the forty
years in which he had been engaged
in law practice. And Manahan was
scored for alleged deliberate and un­
fair misstatement of facts.
No Proof of Conspiracy.
There was absolutely no evidence
of conspiracy and the only course
open to the court was to direct a ver­
dict in favor of the defense. The
slate officers only did their duty.
They had Youmans' request entered
into a contract with the complainant
to settle the accounts of the bank.
This contract was ratified by a series
of letters written by Mr. Youmans.
Hold Meeting Sunday.
There is a report that Messrs. You­
mans, Manahan and others will hold
a.meeting Sunday in the opera house,
when speakers will tell "How It Was
Done." Presumption states that the
loser in the suit will attempt to stir
up more strife and make political
capital out of his failure to put his
hands into the state treasury for
nearly $325,000.

"I believe that if the people urging
us to repare, get us into the state of
preparedness that they desire, they
will find us in a war in a short' time.
"The primary vote leads me to be­
lieve that the majority of the voters
in Michigan feel the same way."
Mr. iFord at present plans to return
to Europe and the Ford Peace con­
ference in May.
"I don't know how much success
will attend my forthcoming trip," con­
tinued Mr. Ford, "'but we are going to

so apparent that the shell manufac­
turers will have a few idle moments
to look at them."

nouncement today in the socialist and
liberal papers that these parties
which constitute a majority in the
second chamber are determined to op­
pose the government bill regulating
war trade despite the threat of Pre­
mier Hamskjold that he will resign
if the bill is not passed without alter­
ation or amendment.
This bill as introduced would give
the government arbitrary right be­

den. It provides no person may enter
into any sort of agreement with for­
eign countries unless it is approved
by the government. Severe punish­

Nation.
•Washington, April 7.—Administra­
tion leaders in Congress are hopeful
that the army increase bill, tirsl, of
the three national defense measures
will enter its final stale next week.
Indications tonight were that only
the remaining action likely to cause
prolonged debate in the Senate was
the one fixing the peace strength of
the regular army.
The Senate voted on only one addi­
tion to Ihe bill today, adopting with­
out roll call the proposal of Senator
Smith of Georgia, that enlisted men
in the regular army hereafter be giv­
en opportunity for 7" hours of vo­
cational education a month during
their active service in peace times.
Debates on various proposals for
the. erection of a government plant
for the llxation of atmospheric oxygen
occupied the remainder of the day
The pending amendment was that of
Senator Smith of (South Carolina, to
appropriate $15,000,000 for a plant,
site, and process to be determined
by the War Department. The surplus
capacity over the government's
needs in peace times, under the pro
posal would go into the manufacture
of fertilizer to be sold by the govern­
ment through the Secretary of Agri
culture.
"There is not a Senator here,'4 said
Senator Underwood, "who does not
jea uonditiomof'
this cduntfy would be in because of
a shortage of nitrates for explosives
if war should be declared against us.
"A second great power could make
us surrender in six months if we had
no surplus of nitrate, nitrogen and it
had plenty."
Senator todge declared that by
leaving private enterprises alone, the
government could get nitrogen cheap
er than in any other way.
Kill Nitrogen Amendment.
The Senate military committee de
cided today not to include provisions
for government nitrogen plant in the
bill. The proposed legislation, it was
decided, can be considered separate

Golst Known as Taylor.
Baltimore, Md., April 7.—New York
and Baltimore agents of the depart
ment of justice today continued their
investigation here into the passport
case. Carl Luedcritz, German consul
at this port, when again asked by a
reporter if he knew Von der Goltz,
made it' clear that he knew him only
under the name of Taylor. When­
ever the name Von der Goltz was
mentioned to the consul, he was quick
to interject the correction, "Mr. Tay­
lor."
Warned Against Discussion.
Judge Rose, in the United States
district court, warned the members of
the federal grand jury against dis­
cussing the case with outsiders. He
further explained that he possessed
no more information than he had seen
in the newspapers in regard to fraud­
ulent passports of Von der Gollz, or
Taylor.
Knew Identity °f "Taylor."
According to agents of the depart­
ment of justice, Consul Luederitz's
name is associated with that of Von
der Goltz thorugh the letter he pre­
sented to the Baltimore consul from
Consul von Papen. He knew Taylor
wad none other than Von der Goltz.

encounter between ihe French and
the Germans.
Continuing tliejr vigorous counter
attacks on the tyonches taken from
them by the Germans between Belli
ancourt and Hill Jii.'i, the French
with the use of fcuml grenades, have
revapttired ndditionsil portions of their
lost ground and in addition, made
progress in communicating irenches.
Around lHaucourl, the Germans
lost a violent attack against, the
French previously^ having prepared
the way by a heavy bombardment,
lasting several hours. The French,
however, through the use of their
curtain of lilie and rapid lire guns, put
down the attack \ul forced the Ger­
mans to retreat, leaving numerous
dead on the ground as they made
their way back to the trenches.
On the remainder of the fronts in
France and Belgiufy, artillery engage­
ments alone have been in progress.
Along the eastern front, there has
been a continuation of lively artillery
engagements in the region south of
Dvinsk, especially about Lake Narcoz
where the Russfaixs succeeded in oc­
cupying portions of German trenches.
The artillery on both sides has been
destroyed around '.-Riga, and Friebrih

French Gauge Losses
The German losses in Verdun up

of 200,000 men. one of the greatest
battle losses in the whole range of
warfare, according to estimates made

eial source, "the result of careful in­
quiry made in tlie highest quarters
in which the figures have been check­
ed and verified."
REFUSES TO TRUST GERMANY
London, April 7. Lord Robert
Cecil, minister of war made a sharp
reply tonight to the speech in the
Reeehstag of Dr. Von Betthmann Hol
lwegg, the German Imperial Chancel­
lor.
Conversing with American corres­
pondents on behalf of the foreign offi­
ce, Lord Robert said the suggestion
that Germany might abandon her sub­
marine warfare if Great Britain re
laxed her food blockade was hardly
likely to be entertained by Great Bri­
tain, which had no faith that any
promise made by Germany regarding
submarine warfare would be kept.
'^Germany slackened her submarine
warfare for some time when the op­
erations of the British navy deprived
her of the necessary number of sub­
marines," said Lord 'Roberts, "but has
now begun it again. I am convinced
Germany cannot be trusted to keep
any promise."

Dr. Arthur Warren Waite Case
Attracts Attention of Medi­

'New York, April 7.—Additional evi­

Arthur Warren Waite, who has con­
fessed the murder of his father-in
law, John E. Peck, of Grand Rapids,
will be sought by the district attor­
ney's office in Grand Rapids, Ann Ar­
bor, Lansing and Kalamazoo, it was
announced tonight. An assistant dis­
trict attorney ad a detective will
leave tomorrow from Michigan to be­
gin the investigation.
Evidence that Waite inoculated
himself with typhoid fever germs
which he had purchased for the al­
leged purpose of causing the death
of his wife's parents, was obtained
today by Distric Attorney Swann.
Perth Rich, attorney for Eugene
Oliver Kane, the embalmer whom
Waite said he gave $9,000 to testify
the fluid used in embalming Mr.
Peck's body contained arsenic, made
a formal demand today for the re­
turn of the $7,800 which Kane dug
up from the spot on Long Island
where he had hidden it, and turned
it over to the district attorney. Rich
said the money was a "gift from Dr.
Waite." Miss Catherine Peck, sister
of the murdered man, also demanded
the money, but it will be held as evi­
dence in the case.
There will probably be another
arrest made tomorrow in the case
of Dr. Arthur W. Waite, who
has confessed the murder of his fath
er-in-law, of Grand Rapids, according
to a statement by the district attor­
ney. Among those who will be ques­
tioned tomorrow will be Eugene Oliv­
er Kane, to whom Waite says he gave
$0,000 in the hope of obtaining evi­
dence that arsenic was used in em­
balming Mr. Peck's body.

A number of long messages were
received from Gen. Pershing today
for transmission to Gen. Funston at
San Antonio, but' none as made pub­
lic here. It as learned, however, that
Gen. Pershing reported that the

they were not considered worth re­

Gen. Pershing in a delayed report
to Gen. Funston received here today
confirmed previous information that
American troops were moving south­
ward from Cusihuirachic on the trail
through Satevo and that all informa­
tion available at' his headquarters in­
dicated that Villa was travelling in
the direction of Parral.
He explained his failure to report
more frequently by statements that
the aeroplane on which he had de­
pended for communication had been
unable to operate successfully and
that weather conditions had inter­
fered with transmission of messages.
He added that he had not been in
communication with his headquarters
at Colonia Dublan for nine days.
Detailed Information.
General Pershing informed Gen.
Funston of the exact position of the
advance columns and what those
unit's are, but this information was
withheld.
Consul Letcher's report that Villa
appeared to be moving south beyond
Satevo, Gen. Gutierrez's assertions
that his force had defeated a band of
50 Villa men at Cieneguillas, 10 miles
south of Satevo, and that' Villa him­
self had left there on the morning of
the same day, increased the hope of
those at headquarters here that per­
haps the American forces might yet
overtake the fugitive bandit within a
short time.

SEVERAL FLATS
ARE PROPOSED
Expansion of Business Indicated
in the Large Building
Program.
Bismarck's biggest building year,
by a margin of several hundred
thousand dolars, is about to be ush­
ered in. Faith in the future of the
Capital City will be manifested by
the investment of at least $750,000.00
iu new construction work, all of
which will be in the nature of per­
manent improvement.
The New Hotel
Construction men are now on the
ground ready to begin work on the
new hotel building on Third strait,
opposite the Masonic temple. This
structure will be modern throughout
will provide at least 100 guest rooms,
and will cost complete, $100,000.00.
The contract has been awarded, and
excavating will be. commenced apt
later than April 15. The new hotel,
with the general offices of the
Hughes Electric Co. and the North.
Dakota. Telephone Co., with the Bis
Sales Co., t¥NSer­
vice Corporation, thi Masonic temple
and the Federal building, with the
possibility of another important
structure being erected during the
summer, will advance Third street to
a place in the first rank of Bismarclc
business thoroughfares.
Other Hotel AMKIom
E, G. Patterson, proprietor of the
McKenzie, has announced tentative
plans for building upon his lot ad«
joining the hotel on the west The
ground floor, it is understood, will be
occupied by an extension of the Ro­
sen Clothes Shop, and it is prob­
able that the addition will be carried
seven stories to the full height of tb
hotel proper, the annex being devot­
ed principally, it is understood, to
family apartments.
It is practically decided that Henry
Tatley will add another story to the
Grand Pacific, and that the Bismarck
hotel will be extended to the alley.
It is possible that Mr. Patterson may
enlarge the Soo.
This new construction will give
Bismarck hotel facilities second to
none in North Dakota, and will make
the Capital City more than ever the
logical central convention city of the
Flickertail state. The fact that Bis­
marck can support all of these hos
telries is certain proof that the city
is ever increasing in importance atf
a distributing center and as a work­
ing base for traveling salesmen.
Splendid Apartment Houses
It is expected that John L. Lar­
son, the Bismarck contractor, will
begin within a week on F. W. Mur­
phy's eighteen-apartment house, Just
north of the Federal building on
Third street. This structure will be
one of the most modern of its kind
in America, in that the only fuel
which will ever enter the building
will be electric energy supplied to
the model ranges with which each
kitchenette will be equipped. The
apartments will range from three to
live rooms, with kitchenette and bath*
and will be heated with steam from
the central heating plant' Every
apartment will be rented, present in­
dications are, long before completion.
A third apartment house, to be
erected in one of Bismirck's
b*t
residential sections, is Bow being
contemplated by a prominent local
builder. Plans for this structure Will
be received this week, and if they
meet with approval, construction will
be commenced as early is weather
permits. It is understood that eft
eighteen-apartment house, thoroogfe
ly modern and in keeping with the
high standard which Bismarck haa
established, is being considered.
