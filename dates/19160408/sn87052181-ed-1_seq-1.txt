EPILEPSY IS COMMUNICABLE
Cincinnati Physician Belioves Bacillus
Probably Exists in the Soil Like
Germ of Lockjaw.
Tho discovery of a germ which he

lteod of Cincinnati, in an address be
fore the seml-Hnnunl meeting of the
MIssouti Valley Medical Society. The
germ la called tho bacillus eplleptlcus
and tho speaker asserted that, like
tho germ of lockjaw, it probably exists
In tho soil and enters tho body through
the stomach.
"When this germ is taken from the
blood of epileptics and injected into
the veins of rabbits,' 'said the speak
er, "It causes them to have epilepsy,
generally in fatal form.
"Babbits fed on food contaminated
with tho germ dovelop epilepsy. Ono
rabbit developed epilepsy, from which
it died, as the result of licking blood
containing the germ from the car of
another rabbit "
In his address Dr. Iteed demonstrat
ed the germ in cultures. In fresh blood
from epileptic patients and In the
blood of rabbits which had been given
the disease. He said there Is abund
ant evidence tending to show that tho
disease often has been communicated
from one person to another.
"This discovery of the real causo
and nature of epilepsy," said Dr. Iteed,
"points not only to cure but to pre
vention. While It brings a brighter
day to the heretofore hopeless epilep
tic, it ought shortly to relieve the stato
of much of a heavy and rapidly grow
ing burden." ,

TREE DECIDES A LAWSUIT
Platte City Jury Aided In Reaching
Verdict by Cross Section of ,
Cottonwood.
The rings on the trunk of n cotton
wood tree, despised among treo fami
lies, were accepted by a Platte City
jury recently as proof tho tree was
thirty years old, and settled tho own
ership of land eh . the treo
stands. Eighty acres, valued at about
$50 an acre, wcro In controversy.
L. W. Stono, who has been living
on tho laud, claimed the property un
der a patent Issued In 1912, declaring
the land, which had been an island
In the Missouri liver, attarnod Itself
to the south' b-ink when' th river
changed its course. E. M. Barr of
Lcnexa, Kas., owner of adjacent land,
claimed the property to tho water
front as an accretion to his land, and
that tho patent was Illegal.
At one time the island near Wald
ron was bounded by two swift cur
rents of tho Mlssourlr river. Later,
the river changed Us channel, about
188C, Mr. Barr contended, leaving ac
cretions on tho south bank, while tho
island itself was washed down tho
river. Mr. Stone declared tho river,
when it changed its course, left tho
Island attached to tho land which Barr
now owns. It was then the property
of Abner Whiteley, who obtained It
from tho orlginnl owner, John Harris,
one ot tho early settlers ot Westporl.
The Commerco Tiust Company, In
charge of tho estate, sold tho land.
A cross section of tho coltonwood
was Introduced as evldenco that it
wns older than the washing away of
the Island. So Barr was awarded tho
land.
ST. CLAIR COUNTY FIGHT ON
Citizens would Compromise a $4,000,
000 Debt for $230,000 Dispute
Clouds Land Titles.
Any proposition leading to a settle
ment of tho 4 million dollar debt which
has clouded land titles in -St. Clair
county, Missouri, for forty-five years,
must come from the creditors. That
fact was mado plain at an informal
hearing beforo Judgo Arba S. Van Val
kenburgh of the federal court nt Kan
sns City. Delegates from the sixteen
townships of the county nnd represen
tative land owners told of deep rooted
sentiment ngainst compromise.
Two veterans, Judgo Davo Walker
nnd "Uncle Bud" Dark, who have been
In the fight for forty years against pay
ment of tho bonds they say aro fraud
ulent, testified. Former Judge Walker
was n member ot the county court in
tho troublesome times many years ago.
Ho has tho reputation of being tho
only member of tho court at that per
iod who escaped arrest.
"Compromise?" shouted Fncle Bud.
"No, by gum, we'll fight 'or 'til 'Onbel'
toots his trumpet."
A more liberal element believes a
proposition from tho bondholders to
wlpo out tho debt on a basis of the
original issue, less Interest and court
costs, might meet with success when
put to a voto in tho county. The orig
inal sum was $231,000.
The amount of tho debt now, approx
imately 4 million dollars, exceeds tho
actual valuo of the county. It wns said.
Tho assessed valuation, ono delegato
said, was about $S00,000. Much of the
land Is unproductive and scarely worth
tho taxes, another assorted.
Mrs. Magdalena Preetorlus Dead.
Mrs. Magdalena Prootorlus, 80 years
old, widow of Dr. Emll Prcetorius and
mother of tho late Edward L. Prce
torius, who committed suicide by
shooting, November 1 lust, is dead in
St. Louis.
Drowned In an Ozark River.
George Cone, nn employe of a
Springfield provision company, wns
drowned iho other night in the James
river when he and a friend oerturned
a boat.
Two Killed In Joplin Mine.
Andrew Springer of Webb fin, and
John Yeisley of Joplin were killed and
six other men were Injured, two per
haps fatally, when n 60-foot rock fell
on them In tho Consumers" mine, near
Joplin the other day.
Aurora Road Bonds Carry.
A bond Issue of $UO,000 was autho

cial road district nt an election held
recently. The voto was 4(i9 for tho
bonds, with only 03 ngainst. The
monoy will bo used In tho construc
tion ot permanent roads in tho Aurora
district.
After Zinc In Moniteau County.
A district Just east of California Is
being mined extensively for lead nnd
zinc. Several rich finds aro being
worked on an SO-acro tract belonging
to C. Meusch. It Is "paying dirt,"
as much of It is milling out 40 per

Disgusted the Minister.
"Tho now minister called upon the
