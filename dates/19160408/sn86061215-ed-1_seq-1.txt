Expedition Into Mexico

NOT TO RETURN TILL
OUTLAW IS SEIZED
U. S. Troops Reported to
Be Far in South and in
Need of Supplies
Washington, D. C., April 7.—Persis
tent reports that the American forces
in Mexico might be recalled soon are
emphatically denied by Secretaries
Lansing and Baker.
Both declare there is no present in
tention of changing the orders given
to Gen. Funston shortly after the
Columbus, N. M., raid to "Get "Villa,
dead or alive."
Border advices that a trainload of
supplies, shipped by private firms, was
on its way today from Juarez for Cas
as Grandes and Pearson, close to Gen.
Pershing's field base, satisfied officials
that the railroads can be used in this
way as a supplementary service to the
motor truck lines even without fur
ther action by Gen. Carranza. Al
though the army is not the actual
shipper of the supplies, it is believed
the practical result will be the same.

CLASH IS EXPECTED.
El Paso, Tex., April 7.—Advance
£tiara§^df -the* American expedition
hunting Pancho Villa are operating to
day near Satevo and news that Col.
Dodd's cavalry has again come into
contact with the Villistas is expected.
The region between Satevo and Par
ral, where Villa is reported to be
heading, is Infested with numerous
bands of Villa brigands.
American refugees from the Benito
Juarez district say that if Villa should
succeed in uniting these bands of
marauders, ho would have an effec
tive force of at least 1,000 men and
would be in position to give the ad
vance American troops a hard battle.
The last official information from
the front showed that American cav
alry had penetrated south of San An
tonio and was still moving southward
hard on the trail of the Villistas. It
is believed that more frequent reports
will now be obtained from Col. Dodd
inasmuch as it is now possible for
him to relay his message by courier
to Chihuahua and thence by Mexican
telegraph lines to El Paso for re
transmission to Gen. Funston at San
Antonio.
ON HOT TRAIL AGAIN.
San Antonio, Tex., April 7.—Fran*
cisco Villa was at Cieneguillas, ten
miles south of Satevo, on April 4,
according to Gen. Luis Gutierrez, com
manding the Carranza troops in Chi
huahua. Gen. Bell received this in
formation from Chihuahua and trans
mitted it to Gen. Funston today. Amer
ican cavalry are pushing forward
along the trails to and beyond Satevo.
Gutierrez reported that Carranza
troops engaged fifty Villa men at
Cieneguillas, killed ten and captured
two. The prisoners said Villa had left
there early in the morning with 200
men, leaving the fifty as a rear guard.
Gen. Bell reported that Mexican
sources indicated that some thousands
of the defacto government troops were
being moved south of Chihuahua with
the ostensible purpose of checking
the retreat of Villa.
Another column of American cav
alry arrived at. Cusihuirachic to sup
port that of Col. W. C. Brown, who re
ported there April 4, according to re
ports at Gen. Funston's headquarters
today. Col. Brown explained his delay

gagement a few days ago at Agua#

he and his forces had exhausted their

REPORT OF BATTLE.
Gen. Pershing's Camp at San Ger'on
imo Ranch, Mexico, April 3.—By aero
plane and motor truck to Columbus,
N. M., April 7.—News of the second
Villa defeat which reached here late
today was taken as a sharp moral de
feat for the Villa forces because the
American cavalrymen had outwitted
them at their own game, that of slip
ping unseen through mountain passes.
The losses of the Villa force, given
as thirty or more dead and forty
horses captured in the Aguas Calientes
fight, were not considered of as much
significance as the manner in which
the coup was executed.

BANDITS AND PEONS AMAZED AT
ABILITY OF AMERICANS TO
SHOOT STRAIGHT.
Columbus, N. M., April 7. —Proof of
the marksmanship of American sol-
straight shooting done at Columbus,
that of the little detachment that pur
sued the bandits across the line after
the raid and that at Guerrero and
Aguas Calientes, was totally unex
pected by the Mexicans. It was utterly
different from shooting they had ex
perienced in engagements between
factional troops in the five years of
civil strife, close followers of the sit
uation assert.
"Villa's followers had been taught
that the Americans were weaklings
cowards who were afraid to match
their strength with Mexican forces," a
naturalized Mexican living here said
today. "They believed, in their ignor
ance, implicitly in themselves and
their ability to conquer any force they
should encounter., I am convinced that
before the Columbus raid their feeling
was that of contempt of a larger man
for a smaller, weaker antagonist."
The first shock was given the Vil
listas when seventy-nine of their men
were killed by half as many troopers
of the thirteenth cavalry, who made
the sortie across the International line
after the raid. It was at Querrero that
the contrast between the marksman

demon­
strated. There the troopers of the
seventh cavalry shooting coolly and
steadily sent almost every bullet to its
mark, while Gen. Hernandez's soldiers
fired wildly as they ran.
A similar demonstration of marka
tnanship at Agua Calientes confirmed
the suspicion already growing in the
minds of the bandits that the ability
of the "gringoes" had been misrepre
sented to them, according to arrivals
Army men here point out that, al
though important, the moral effect up
on Villa's command of the display of
American marksmanship Is a minor
consideration as compared with the ef
fect upon the peons of the district.
DE-
CIDE TO TAKE NO ACTION ON
SUBMARINES AT PRESENT.
Washington, D. C., April 7.—Presi
dent Wilson and the cabinet consider
ed the submarine situation again to
day without deciding on action at this
time. It was understood the situa
tion still waits on Germany's answer
to the inquiries pn the recent de
struction of the Sussex and other ves
sels.
All evidence at hand regarding the
destruction of the British ohannel
steamer Sussex and scores of other
merchant ships, some carrying Ameri
can citizens, has been assembled at
the state department.
The evidence includes reports of
American naval attaches containing
the statement that metal fragments of
a German torpedo were found on the
Sussex. The reports are regarded
here as positive .proof that a German
submarine attacked the Sussex in di
rect violation of assurances given the
United States by the Berlin govern
ment.
Col. E. M. House, who is a white
house guest, conferred with the presi
dent and cabinet members regarding
the publication.
The number, of neutral vessels sunk
recently engaged the attention of of
ficials today. Uno'fflcial advices say
that over twenty neutral ships and
more than twenty-five belligerent ves
sels have been torpedoed within the
last week, most of them without
warning.
ROOSEVELT SAYS
HE IS CANDIDATE
Washington, D. C., April 7. —The an
nouncement from Oyster Bay that Col.
Roosevelt will be a candidate under
certain conditions was received with
mixed emotions in the capital today.
Republicans as a rule took it as a mat
ter of course and as something not al
together unexpected. Democrats, on
the other hand, tried hard to appear
joyful, but secretly confessed fears.
One of the first results of the an
nouncement was the springing of ru
mors that all the favorite son candi
dates would get out of the way for
either Roosevelt or Hughes.

Against the Britons at

London, April 7.—The Germans are
not only engaged in heavy fighting
with the French again around Verdun,
but they have started a strong offen
sive against the British near St. Eloi,
in an endeavor to win back six hun
dred yards of trenches which the Brit
ish took from them ten days ago.
Both Germans and French have
made gains. The Germans captured
the village of Harcourt, which is north
west of Verdun and is considered by
the Germans as an Important strategic
point. The French official report ad
mits that the Germans gained a foot
hold at Harcourt in spite of repeated
checks and bloody sacrifices."
In severe hand to hand fighting, the
French drove the Germans back
through their underground passages
for a distance of 200 maters along a
front of 600 meters south of Ft.
Douaumont.
A French official report says the
Germans lost thirty-five aeroplanes
during March and that the French lost
only thirteen.
East of the Meuse the French are
continuing their nibbling tactics and
report continued progress southwest
of Ft. Douamont.

Pensacola, Fla., April 7.—The new

IN SUBMARINE MATTER.
London, April 7.—F^riedrlch von
Payer of the progressive people's
party touched upon German-American
relations in an address in the reich
stag yesterday, from which Reuter's
Amsterdam correspondent quotes as
follows:
'"The political influence of America
has risen with the duration of the war.
Its growth lays the heaviest responsi
bility on those European states which
caused the war. We feel ourselves
united with America by ties of blood
and we hope the American people will
give us justice.
"At the present moment America
can perhaps render the world the
greatest service by keeping out of
reach of the flames of war."
The correspondent quotes Dr. Gus
tave Stresemann, national liberal, as
follows:
"Just interests of neutrals must be
respected, as has hitherto been done
by'the government In the strictest
manner. America has interpreted the
idea of neutrality in a manner incom
patible with the German notion. It
is an unjustifiable demand that armed
merchantmen should be permitted to
sail unhindered within the war zone."
