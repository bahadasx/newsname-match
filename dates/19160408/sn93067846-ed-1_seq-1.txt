Commissioner McMaster Writes of
Underwriting Situation?Makes Sug?
gestion to Agents.
Columbia, April 6.?A bill of In?
dictment of "wonts" on the part of
the withdrawing Are insurance com?
panies has been drawn by Fits Hugh
McMaster, insurance commissioner, in
a letter sent out by him. He said
yesterday that the situation is still in?
volved and that the letter gives his
present views. \
"Unless the law is repealed," con?
cludes Mr. McMaster, "South Caro?
lina must take care of herself, with
the* aid of the insurance organizations
now doing business here," He urges
the agents to organize mutual com
I panles.
The letter follows:
"There are about a dozen stock
companies now doing agency business
in the State. The withdrawing stock
companies could.do business just as
well under the law as the companies
which are here, but they won't.
"The withdrawing companies could
help their old agents and persistent
policyholders by taking renewals
through their former agents as
brokers, without the companies sub?
jecting themselves to the law of the
State, but they won't.
: "The withdrawing companies could
take reinsurance from the companies
now here and the situation would be
much relieved, but they won't.
"The withdrawing companies could
withhold their disapproval (and the
consequences) and thus permit the
strictly reinsuring companies doing
business with the companies now herd
and the situation would be much re?
lieved, but they won't
H "Thirty of the withdrawing com?
panies forming the Factory Insurance
association, which is by name exempt?
ed frOm the law, could continue that
form of insurance and that would be
Some help, but they won't.
"The withdrawing: companies will
not do business here, - and no other
companies closely allied with them
- will do business here1.
"Regardless of what may be the
laws of other States, the Are insurance
companies which have withdrawn
: from South Carolina are; determined
they will 'not be denied the power to
combine as to rates'and they refuse'
- to- permit the State to have any re?
visory power over those rates: There
! 4re a few incidental. contentions; .but
Xhey amount to n^Vhfng, and the case
is stat-jd In the preceding sentence.
! therefore unless, the law is repeal?
ed South Carolina must take care of
In m, *oe, 'theee orKml?&h?'
4rill scarcely be able to take care of
the best incurable risks which are
protected by municipal waterworks.
Property not so protected must be
insured otherwise, and I see no chance
for this except In mutual companies.
Every thinking Individual knows that
each class of property must or should
pay Its own Are losses, whether the
Insurance be in a stock company or
m a* mutual. There Is no - prospect
Qf organising many, stock companies. *

PAVING CONTRACTS AWARDED.
CHARLESTON, AUGUSTA AND
CHATTANOOGA FIRMS GET
CONTRACTS FOR WORK.
Brick, Concrete and Sheet 6\ss^snst
Will he Materials Used in Paring
Streets?Residence Section Will be
Asphalt?Work Will Probably Com?
mence Within About Thirty Days.
Council at its meeting last night
decided upon the awarding of the
contracts for the city paving, an?
nouncing the names to whom the
contracts had been let at the close of
their session, after they had thorough?
ly gone over the bids and had heard
from a number of the contractors of
the merits of the various forms of
paving.
The brick work will be done by the
Georgia Engineering and Construc?
tion Company of Augusta. The Ely
Contracting Company of Chattanooga
will do the sheet ihalt work and
the concrete pa\ ?' and sidewalks
will be laid by onmons-Mayrant
Company of Ch; iton. The brick
paving contract ? let at $1.46 a
square yard on ~' macadam-gravel
base already do $ on some of the
streets and at ? * on streets where
a concrete fou* . Ion has to be laid,
i The concrete e 11 paving was let at
$1.28 a square ? d and the sidewalks
at 8 0 1-2 cer . square yard. The
contract pric ? r the sheet asphalt
work has not ej( been published.
The work o*he streets will prob?
ably begin ' ??in about thirty days.
The contrac are willing to begin
as soon as / can move their ma?
chinery and iorces here and get the
necessary material on the ground.
This it Is thought will probably take
at least three or four weeks.
Council named the pavings for the
various streets which had petitioned
for paving, although the order in
which they will be paved has not yet
been stated, nor is It stated positively
that all of these streets will be paved,
las it is do ibtful if there are sufficient
funds for paving all of the streets
which petitioned for paving. Brick
wMl be used on some of the streets
which have heavy traffic, (concrete
on others and sheet asphalt will be
used on all of the principal residence
streets which will be paved. It has
not yet been positively decided wheth
I er lake asphalt or oil asphalt will
be used in the paving, the former be?
ing slightly more expensive than the
latter, but considered better by
Councilman' Booth", although the
analysis of the two shows that the
dti and lake asphalts are of the same
chemical constituents.
