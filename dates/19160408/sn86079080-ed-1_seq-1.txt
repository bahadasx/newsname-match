Democratic camp fires of the

a~ternoon rally which stirred the
Sliitiac of St. John, Jefferson
d St. Charles. A great plat
was erected in front of the
ouse and a crowd which
many of the most pro

es joined the Democratic
era. Addresses were made
Judge Prentice E. Edrington,
S.n. Overton of Rapides,
Robert Rivarde, who
just been returned to his seat

What The Editor Has To Say.
In its last issue, the political
hybrid, L'Observateur, hope
' with apparently renewed vigor
upon what everyone considered
a closed incident, namely, the
Hunter incarceration. As usual
the editor of that fraudulent
Ijournal twisted the facts of the
I case to suit his own illegitimate
caprice. He said that in the Hun
ter case Sheriff Berthelot had
testified positively that Hunter
had remained in jail only seven
days. This we wish to brand as
an unqualified falsehood because
our correspondent, who was in
the Court-room when Mr. Ber
thelot was on the witness-stand,
informs us that the Sheriff made
no such statement. Such distor
tion of the truth and attempt to
vilify a faithful public officer
can only emanate from Wallace
Lasseigne's illusive mind. When
asked by Attorney Perkins how
long Hunter had remaine 1 in ja;l
Mr. Berthelot truthfully ans wer
ed that he did not know because
he did not keep account of
prisoners' incarceration HIM
SELF; that this account was kept
by his Chief Deputy (in this in
stance, Mr. Laurent. now deceas
ed) and that the book in which
such accounts are kept would be
the best and only reliable proof
as to how long each and every
prisoner remained in jail. If the
lamented Mr. Laurent were liv
ing to day the cowardly editor
would never have dared to make
his reckless statement.
At the end of L'Observateur's
article we note the reason why
its editor is always soliloquizing
over what the Sheriff did or
should do. In this instanee his
lament is caused by the Sheriff's
refusal to give L'Observateur a
certain advertisement. His brand
ing of the Sheriff as a "robber"
will not surprise and be thought
over seriously by the intelligent ,
public. Our recollection is pretty 1
clear of the times when the ed
itor of L'Observateur branded t
several of his present Demigods
as "robbers, thieves and mon
keys", but as soon as these men
favored the giving of the official
work to L'Observateur they im
mediately became "honorable" 1
in the eyes of its editor. In short
L'Observateur's whole course of
action can be measured in dollars
and cents. His attitude reminds
us very much of old negr' Basile
who called himself a Simon-pure
Republican but who would be
come a Democrat d -- quick if
anyone would buy him a drink.

In reply to an interview by
Mr. Hart, printed in 'Tfe )aily
States, March 28, Mr kº erithelot
says:
"Mr. Hart seemn: t' take t-i
fenseat an interview of Di)trict
Attorney Marrero, 1,b:i-Iitd in
The Daily States a f..-v days ago
In said interviow 3 \. M`arrvro
commented on the fact th tt the
board of supervisor of mSt. Jlohn4
had denied repr.sentli,,n to L'o'- 1
r'leasant at the pulls in the cin
ing election. Instead of ansxver
ing the charge made Ibv the dis
trict attorney. Mr. ttHa;t attempts
to justify his political curse and
that of the board by hurling
abuses at me person;al lv. M r. Mar
rero, in his interview kn,-w
whereof he spoke and was not
'imposed upon' by n.. as Mr.
Hart would have the, peoplo un- I
derstand. The duties of the dis
trict attorneys' office lmake it
neees'ary for him to be in this
parish frequently and he is ju-t
as familiar with political coudi
tions Here as ei:her Mr. Hart or
myself.
Registered As Democrats;
Working For Parker.
"Mr. Hart states hat every
commissioner and clerk appoint
ed by the board of shppervi-or of
this parish is a Demo..rat and so
registered. It never has b.e:i iln
timated by anybody th-.t these
election officials are no: regist.-r
ed as Democrats, tbut the fact
that they, together with the
oalance of the Hart followc-s,
are boosting and shoutin- for
Parker make it at least appar,,nt
that they will vote the I'rogrr.;
sive-R.,pubhcan ticke, next el.,,"
tion. The opinion of Mr. H: L
that these election officials w!il
support the Regular o'finle:
and represent him at the polls is
ridiculous to the weil-informeu
here in St. John The mere fa,.t
that they are registered a, Demo
crats will not in itself help thet
cause of Democracy and give re
presentation at the pls to Co'.
Pleasant.
"I want to deliberatelv state
and co(rroborate the intervi-ew
given by Mr. Marrero that Col.
Pleasant has receive I outrageous
treatment at the hands .of the
boll of supervisors of St. Johin
parish. After careful investiga
tion I have reached the conclusion
that every election official ag
pQinted by the local board is a
Parker man. This I do not state
as a mere pinion.' bit as a fact
erevealed by thorough investiga
tion. This fact is of co, umon know
ledge here in St.. ohn. and I can i
not see how Mr. Hart can honestly I
be of the opinion that these elec-.
tion officials will vot*e for and re
present Col. Pleasant at the polls.
"Mr. Mart, realizing that I am!
the biggest obstruction to the
Parker campaign in this parish,
would like to have the Democrats
of the state believe that I am a
fifth-wheel in the politics of St.
John and that my remaining
silent would inure greatly to the
benefitof Col. Pleasant.

the presence of a loyal Pleasant

Hart 'keep the matte- straight'
before he attempts to throw his

or to belittle me in the eyes of my
friends throughout the state.

that 1 have taken it upon myself

Whole Hart Bunch Can't
Beat Pleasant.
Henry C. Maurin, of Laplace,
secretary-treasurer of the Jeffer
son College Alumni Association,
in a letter to Democratic head
quarters Thursday morning tak
e6 exception to a statement by
Charles Thibodaux, nominee
from St. John for the legislature,
to th, effe"t that "Parker will
carry St. John by several hund.
red majority."
Thibodaux, the candidate of
the Hart faction of St. John, is
the Democratic nominee from
the parish for the house of rep.
resentitive-, but now he is a
Parker shoiter. This, according
to Maurin, indicates that the
Hart faction, which supported
Barret in the r rimary, hasjumbed
the Democratic party.
''As for I hib.,daux's assertion
that Parker will carry St. John
:)y several hundred majority,"
Vir. Maurin's letter continues,
"he is certainly in error, for even
if the whole Hart faction lends its
solid support to Parker, I feel
confident that Col. Pleasant will
still lead by a Pmall margin.
"We of the Berthelot faction
gave Colonel Pleasant a majority
in the primary against Barret,
who was supported by Hart and
his faction, and we feel that we
can repeat the same vote not
withstanding what Mr. Thibo.
daux and his followers may say
to the contrary,
"During the last two days I
made a short tour of this parish,
and also of St Charles, and from
information gathered here and
there I feel confident that St.
John and St. Charles will both
look very Pleasant on April 18, in
spite of the fact that some Demo
.::;tic nominees such as ,Res
oresontative Charles Thibo.
iaux of St. John, who was]
nominated in a Democratic. pri.
mary and is today cpenly support
,ng a 'arker Republican leader.
T:,is is indoed an e'xampl6 of a
iUsloval Demrorat."
