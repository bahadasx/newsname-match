—The fnlted States will resard

pleted when the de facto govern

This became known toda> from
the original orders which the war
department nn Qea. Funsion.
When asked whether a time
limit had hoen placed on the cx
lodition's operations in Mexico,
the department revealed the offi
cial orders kivoii Kunston at the
beginning of the campaign,
March 10.
They directed Funston to "or
gani'/.e an adequate force under
Gen. Pershlng and instruct Him
to cross the border in pursuit of
the Vlllistas who raided Colum

drawn as soon as the de facto

be " .mii'il as finished when

The hunt for Villa must con

These are the rights which the
NonparttPun league id out to win,
as outlined by speakers frotu all
political iMirties who opened the
iioni'in t :> wiK.iiip camputgn in Ta
i miiii In i night at a mass meet
ing in the Temple of Music.
The meeting emphasized the
fact that the Nonpartisan league
is not fighting any political puvty
in particular, hut is working for
tlie aholitlon of all purty ma
chines in the state, and the sys
tem l>y which the people's so-call
ed representatives are forced to
give over their own individual
judgment to party caucuses.
It asserted further that the
league is not in itself a political
party, any more than the Direct
Legislation league Is a political
party, but proposes to eliminate
all parties and choose represen
tatives on their individual merits.
The speakers were ex-Congresß
ruan J. \V. Bryan, republican;
State Representative W, D. Lane,
progressive; Mrs. Menzies of Ta
conia. republican; Qienn Hoover
of Seattle, socialist; Charles Per

Mrs. Balabanoff, Taconia clulf

Securely Hidden
Kthel Oliver, mihsing Taconia
girl, who reappeared nt her home
Sunday, is still missing, as far as
tlie public is concerned.
I'nder the protective wing of
University of Washington soror
ity girls and sorority house ma
trons, women who "never tell a
secret," lOthel is living in peace
and (|iiiet. undisturbed hy inquisi
tive callers.
She is a domestic in one of the
sorority houses.
Only an undersized Seattle
juvenile officer and Kthel's moth
er acknowledge that they know
jiiKt where you can find the girl
—and they won't tell.
< ■>-» 'I- llllKil fill.
The truth-telling, gossiping co
eds Innocently profess entire ig
norance ol the whole matter, all
the while holding down the cur
tain which protects Ethel Oliver
from the puhlic gaze.
The discovery of Ethel, on the
campus, under an ussumed name,
Is the leading co-ed gossip to
day. Yet if you visit a sorority
house tile dear little co-eds will
invite you to sit In an easy co-ed
chair and then beglu to fling at
you their expressions of astonish
ment at the extraordinary cir
cumstance.
Ethel hai; fonnd some good
friends on the coiupus who are
systematically keeping her out of
the limelight: and so far nobody
has "squealed."
Merrill s.i.«« So.
That Ethel uoti^ily ig working

Whom she told her whereabouts.
Imnicili.iU'h after her disappear
ance she went to Seattle and ob
laim-d employ merit on tlie cam
pus.
Her mother visited her Thurs
day ] afternoon. Blother and
dauKiiii'i patched up all their dif
ferences and everybody is happy.
Yet a systematic search of all
the sdrortty girls' homes —ns far
as « poor in.iii reporter dared to
go—t-yesterdgy failed to reveal
even a glimpse of Ktliel.
Will Minder Out?
Dr Merrill sayo the house ma
tron doesn't want Ktliel to have
callers, and tnat Kthel herself
doesn't want to have her tranquil
life with the girls disturbed.
Vial the mothering, Kossiping
co-ed* have gone to her protec
tion loyally.
All is quiet along the campus.
It probably will remain so until
the strain becomes too great and
some bursting girl student tells
