ADMITS BITTER PEELING
Resentment Toward U. S. Has Grown
Among Masses as Result of
Alleged Sympathy With
the Entente.
BERLIX, April 7, via London,
April 8.?Recent press dispatches
have brought word of statements
in the Canadian parliament and
Canadian newspapers that Germany
was planning after this war
to plunge upon the American continent,
and particularly to demand
cession to Germany of the Dominion
of Canada. In a conversation
with Herr von Jagow, minister
of foreign affairs, the Associated
Press correspondent referred
to these rumors. The foreign
minister's first reply was an.'
outburst of laughter.
"How can people invent or believe
such stories?" he asked.
"To any one not entirely blinded
by passion it is evident beyond
doubt that Germany never pursued
such senseless aims and
never contemplated doing so.
Refers to Conquest of U. S.
"Can one Imagine a state of affairs
fn Europe after the war such thaf we
should have the leisure or a free
enough hand to divert our strength and
efforts to such a task on the American
continent?
"Equally ridiculous, though unfortunately
this phase has a serious side,
are rumors which I understand here
and there are current in the United
States that Germany after the war
will take revenge on the United States
by pursuing an anti-American policy.
It Is even reported to me that some
apprehensive souls in America foresee
from victorious Germany an attempt
to break down the Monroe doctrine,
plant its flag* in South or Central America.
or even a design to leap upon the
United States, and crush them in order
to attain mastery of both continents.
"I need hardly assure you such reports,
which from time to time have
been set afloat by enemies of Germany
In the evident intention of stirring
ieeling against it. are too absurd for
denial, I need only recall that Germany-'has
never placed itself in opposition
to the American principle of the
Monroe doctrine.
Left V. S. With Free Hand.
"Again I would ask American doubters
to remember the attitude of Germany
during the Mexican crisis. Although
extensive German commercial
interests were involved, and although
fhere was a strong demand for independent
action to protect those interests
during the protracted era of disorder,
the imperial government at all
times stood for leaving the United
States a free hand in its policy toward
.Mexico. The Washington government
has not at any time left in doubt as
flj the attitude of Germany.
"It is unfortunately true that durtng
the war, when the thoughts of
.very German are bound up heart and
^KjI in the struggle for German existence
against a world-wide coalition,
when the attitude of the Washington
government at times has been al1
most forced, even we think that there
jnight be some basis for stories of an
understanding of some sort between
Washington and the allies. A strong
feeling of resentment and bitterness
against the United States has sprung
up among the masses in Germany.
Foolish Talk of Bevenge.
"Unfortunately, too, there are foolish
persons among us who talk darkly and
foolishly of 'taking revenge* upon the
United States after the war for that
attitude, but *no responsible official
takes or can take such a view. We
shall have quite enough to do at home
to safeguard our own position in
Europe, heal the wounds of the war, restore
our industry and business life at
home and regain and build up our foreign
trade, without reversing our traditional
policy in regard to the American
continent and taking on a new and
powerful enemy across the Atlantic."
"Hut what of the recent letter in the
Frankfurter Zeitung, attributed to a
naval officer, proposing even to exact
from the United States after the war
an indemnity to cover Germany's financial
sacrifices; what of frequent intimations
of the possibility of backing
up Japan by alliance in a coming war
against the United State*?" asked the
correspondent.
"These stories and others like them
that have reached the United States
are brought back by every returning
American traveler. Can* your excellency
wonder that they find credence
from many Americans who are not accustomed
to thinking in terms of world
politics and are unfamiliar with the
limitations of the policy of a state in
international affairs?"
"Do enthusiasts and jingoes in your
country never talk foolishly?" countered
Herr von Jagow.
Interests Do Not Bun Counter.
"The policy of s state cannot be dictated
by sentiment, cannot afford to alk
low Itself to be culded or swayed In Its
permanent form by temporary feelings
of bitterness or resentment, but only

BITTER CLASHES IN
RIGOSBANK CASE
Motion for Bill of Particulars
and Advance of Trial
ArniiaH
ni yugiii
JUSTICE TAKES QUESTION
UNDER ADVISEMENT
Court Promises Decision at the
Earliest Possible
Moment.
Clashes between counsel enlivened
the presentation of arguments on a
motion for a bill of particulars and to
advance for trial the Riggs Bank case
at the hearing today before Justice
Siddons in Criminal Court No. 1. After
nearly four hours of argument the case
was taken under advisement by Justice
Siddons. who said he would announce
his decision as early as possible.
There were several sharp and bitter
exchanges between Attorneys George
P. Hoover, arguing for the motion in
behalf of the defendants, and District
Attorney Laskey, and between Frank J.
Hogan of the counsel for the defendants
and Assistant District Attorney
James B. Archer.
At one stage Attorney Hogan warned
Mr. Archer to "be careful and keep
within the records" and not to attempt
to cast aspersions upon the characters
of the counsel on the other side. This
was provoked by a statement by Archer
charging that a newspaper campaign
had been instigated in an attempt to
show that the affidavit on w^hich the
perjury charges are based was sworn
to by accident.
Called Baseless Lie.
Mr. Hogan defined this as an absolute
and baseless lie, and stated that the
affidavit was drawn by him, and that
no more deliberate act was ever done
by human hand.
In response Mr. Archer expressed regret
at not being permitted in court to
fPSPnt what ho oha ro ptorirorl a a "thif;
Billingsgate" in the usual way. '
The courtroom was crowded at the
beginning: of the hearing, the space reserved
for attorneys having every seat
occupied. The defendants in the case
?Charles C. Glover. William J. Flather
and Henry H. Flather. respectively
president, vice president and former
cashier of the Riggs National Bank,
who are charged with perjury, were not
present.
The array of counsel representing the
government was Assistant Attorney
General Fitts, District Attorney John E.
Laskey and Assistant District Attorney
James B. Archer. Those fpr the de.
fendants were George P. Hoover, Daniel
O.Donoghue, J. J. Darlington and Frank
J. Hogan.
Arguments for the motion were
opened by Attorney Hoover and were
closed by Attorney William G. Johnson.
Had to Wait Month.
Mr. Hoover argued that when the attorneys
for the defendants had asked
for a bill of particulars. In order that
the time of the court and counsel
might be saved, they werfe given what
was, in fact, a copy of records on the
books of Lewis Johnson & Co., containing
932 items of transactions al(Continued

It Says.

Two Hundred Thousand Men Have
Been Sacrificed in Verdun
Drive, Allied Capitals
Hear.
LONDON, April 8. ?The
salient in the French lines west
of the Meuse, with the village of
Bethincourt at its sharp angle, is
being pounded on both sides by
the crown prince's "troops, which
in their latest drive succeeded in
making a new dent in the line
southwest of Bethincourt.
The success was achieved near
Haucourt village, the important
position lost by the French on
Wednesday, the Germans gaining
a footing in two small field works
between Haucourt and hill No.
287, which lies two-thirds of a
mile to the south of the village.
On the other side of the salient
there also has been sharp fighting,
but according to Paris today
the advantage here was with the
French, who bested their adversaries
in grenade combats between
Bethincourt and Chattan
court.
The German war office announced
today the capture of
French positions more than two
kilometers wide west of the
Meuse.
French Gain in Attack.
The French in a grenade attack yes- j
terday retook portions of the trenches
captured from them by the Germans
between Bethincourt and Hill 265, and
made progress in communicating
trencheB in the same region, according
to the French official communica- j
tion issued last night. !
There has been little fighting elsewhere
in the Verdun region. A Ger- |
man grenade attack near Fort Vaux
was repulsed by the French, whose positions
east of the Meuse have been
subjected to intermittent bombardment.
French Statement.
The French official statement of today
says:
"In the Argonne district there has
been fighting at Fille Morte, where we
exploded two small mines tvith success.
At Hill No. 285 we have occupied1
the southern side of the mine crater j
created by the explosion of a German I
mine. {
"To the west of the River Meuse the
Germans last night renewed their at- I
tacks against our positions south and
east of Haucourt. At this latter point,
in spite of repeated efforts, the enemy
found it impossible to dislodge us from
our lines. We poured out upon him aj
murderous fire, which caused him heavy
losses. '
"South of Haucourt the Germans succeeded
in winning a footing in two
small works, between Haucourt and
Hill No. 287, which we had occupied.
Some Advantage Claimed.
I "Southeast of Bethincourt there has
been 9 continuation of the fighting with
hand grenades in the communicating
trenches on the road between BethlnI
court and Chattancourt, which resulted
In some advantages to ourselves.
I "East of the River Meuse there has
been an intermittent bombardment of
our positions. An attack made by the
enemy with hand grenades against one
I of our trenches north of the Vaux fort
was repulsed by the French fire.
"In the Woevre district the night
passed quietly.
"In the Vosges a reconnaissance on
the part of the enemy in an endeavor
to occupy one of our small posts at
Eangenfeldkopf, to the south of Somdernach,
was dispersed by our artillery."
Losses Placed at 200,000.
The ucrman losses Derore veraun up
to the present time have reached the
huge total of 200,000 men?one of the
greatest battle losses in the whole
range of warfare, according to esti- i
mates made public in Paris from a j
semi-official source?"the result of I
careful inquiry made in the highest i
quarters, in which the figures have i
been rigorously checked and verified." j
"Documentary ami verbal testimony j
gathered and authenticated permit the '
giving of precise details concerning'
the losses suffered by the Germans and
by us on the Verdun front," says the i
semi-official communication given to j
I the Associated Press. "During the j
period from February 21, when the
battle began, to April 1 it is known
that two army corps?namely, the third
and the eighteenth?have been withdrawn
from the front, having lost in
the first attacks at least one-third of
their force. They have reappeared
since and have again suffered like
losses.
Beinforcements Used Up.
"The German reinforcements are
practically used up as fast as they are
put in line. The total effectives of
the Wth Corps have in this way lost
1
IN
17,000
men and the 3d Corps has lost
22,000 men.
"Concerning the 121st Division, which
took possession of North Vaux about
March 12, we have precise information.
[ More than one-half of the 7th Regij
merit of its reserves was put out of acj
tion by our machine guns in the ineffectual
attack against the slopes of
the fort. The 60th Regiment met similar
losses, of which the total reached
60 per cent of the regiment's effectives.
"The 19th German Infantry had already
suffered similar losses in attacking
the village of Vaux on March 8.
Its 13th Company was surprised and
annihilated. In entering the village
houses its 1st Battalion was reduced
60 per cent.
Reduced to Half Strength.
| "Three regiments of the 11th Bavarian
Division, wnicn ieu tne auacK on me
Malancourt and the Avocourt woods on
March 20 and 22, were each reduced by
one-half. Their loses varied between
50 and 60 per cent. The same is true
of the losses of the 4th Regiment of
the 2d Division of landwehr engaged
under similar conditions.
"The foregoing are only losses during
actual attack and do not include the losses
of regiments in the trenches or in reserve
under the fire of our cannon. They are
solely the current actual losses. We know
that certain German units have had very
high current losses, that is to say, losses
from artillery Are, when no action of the
infantry was in progress. We cite, for
instance, the 37th Regiment of infantry,
which was surprised by our flre while on
the march to the trenches. It lost about
500 men, and from this fact was so reduced
that it could not, March 10, take
part in the attack on the village of
Vaux, as was ordered, in place of the
19th Regiment, which'had been decimated
by our machine guns.
German Official Report.
The German statement of today follows:
"On the left bank of the Meuse
Silesian and Bavarian troops took by
storm a strong French point of support
south of Haucourt. They captured
the entire enemy position on the ridge
of Termiten hill, extending over a
width of more than two kilometers.
"A counter attack attempted early this
morning failed completely. Our losses
were slight. Those of the enemy, owing
partly to the treacherous behavior of
some, were very heavy. In addition to
those fifteea officers and 699 men were
captured uninjured, including numerous
recruits of the class of 1916.
"On the hills east of the Meuse and in
the Woevre sector the artillery was
very active on both aides.
"On Hllsen ridge, south of Sondermach,
in the Vosges, a small German
detachment came upon an advanced
French position, the occupants of which
were killed, with the exception of thirty-one
men, who were captured. The
enemy's trenches were blown up."
Balkan Agreement Beported.
BERLIN, April 8.?"A recent Interview

BACK ROOT FOR PURPOSE
New York Bepablicani Aim to Make
Convention Delegation Factor
in Conservatism.
According to Information reaching republicans
at the Capitol today, the credibility
of which cannot be questioned, the
action of prominent republicans in New
York entering in the presidential race the
name of Elihu Root has one purpose,
namely:
To crystallize and consolidate republican
sentiment in the Empire state in favor
of conservatism and thereby to arm
the New York delegation to the national
convention and make it a definite and
positive conservative force as well as to
accentuate its influence.
Do Not Expect Boot's Nomination.
It is not understood that the movers
in this enterprise expect the nomination
of Mr. Root. That they are sincere
in wishing his nomination is undoubted,
but the signers of the declaration
are not men likely to cheat
themselves playing solitaire, and while
they would be ever so glad to see hifn
nominated if they thought he could
win at the polls, the understanding
here is that they will first be intent
upon tightening up the New York delegation
to the end of nominating a man
who may reunite the factions of the
republican party.
Tne presentation of the Root candidacy
is said to be distinctly hostile to
the suggested Roosevelt candidaoy. It
is not very friendly to the movement
by Mr. Justice Hughes' friends in his
behalf?that is to say, it is not pro
liugnes, esseni.sa.ny.
TURNED BACK BY THE STORM.
President Abandons River Trip and
Will Return Late This Afternoon.
President Wilson, who left last night
on the naval yacht Mayflower for a
week-end cruise, will return to Wash- I
ington at once, arriving about 4:30 p.m.
today. Snow and sleet were given officially
as the cause for his return.
Secretary Lansing said no new information
had been received from the
German government concerning the submarine
question, but it was expected at
any time. The Secretary plans to see
the President tonight.

:hrough the soaping of about a half av:
mile of track at that point by un- f...
known persons, and a motorman lu
named Hollis was injured and taken
10 the Alexandria Hospital for treat- ^
ment. It is thought that the greasing gC<
nf the track was the work of sympathizers
rather than of strikers themselves.
The soaped track was on a steep in

Some of the striking men this morning ^
ire alleged to have said that they and .
their unionized colleagues are not averse 1111
to seeing the mails go through, and that lik<
the men generally would be willing to the
transport them even if they are on strike,
t>ut that this would entail the transpor- sup
tation of passengers also, which they will fift
not countenance. These statements do not jf j
agree with the reply said to have been ,
nade by strikers yesterday when com- ine
nany officials asked thorn at least to carry stej

nents. were refused. .. .
