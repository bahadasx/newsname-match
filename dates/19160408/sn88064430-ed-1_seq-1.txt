Honorable William Jennings Bryan
will hasten from the Nebraska prima
ries, in which his brother is a candi
date for governor, to speak to the
Bouthern Conference for Education
and Industry at New Orleans on the
evening of April the 20th. Mr. Bryan's
message at that time may prove to
be the most momentous in all his ea
ET reer. He is going to New Orleans be
cause he recognizes the Southern
Conference as one of the great fo
rums of the country. With an aud
ience made up of agricultural, indus
trial, educational and religious lead
ers from every section of the South.
the vital power of his message goes
straight to the whole people.
This unique audience is due to the
tn meeting of a number of organizations
f- in close proximity: The Southern So
ciological Congress, the Southern In
dustrial Council the Southern Agricul
tural Association, the Conference of
Churchl and Sunday School Workers.
- the Conference of Southern Women,
ire together with Conferences of School
to and College Workers, each grappling
mi with a specific phase of Southern Ge
a velopment. All these bodies unite to
ed ten great mass meetings at which the
oa effort is to get at the undertakings
25 upon which all forces shall unite.
at The New Orleans gathering comes
its at the time of the greatest upheaval
ip. the world has known since the Roman
he Empire went to pieces before the Ger
o man onslaughts in the fifth century.
a. The first evening of the conference
will be devoted to the lessons of the
w- war, to be set forth by such leaders
. as J. H. Phillips of Alabama, E. A.
ii- Alderson of Virginia, President Good
he now of Johns Hopkins University, and
ry J. L. McBrien of the National Bureau
ry of Education. It Is planned that on
ar another evening five or six of the
at. editors of our greatest dailies will tell
he what they think the united forces of
d, the South ought to undertake in the
of next decade. On another evening, a
at group of governors will chart the
Southern path as they see it leading
* out through the uncertainties of this
pe convulsed time.
s As a climax to all, the great com
to moner, whom the South has followed
rt in heroic struggle will open up a
I passibfllty which If worked out will
e mark the beginning of a new era in
. the history of all the Americas, in
which the SBoth will be a commsan
o ltg !etor.

ADMITS PLOT TO
BLOW UP ,LINER
ERNEST SCHILLER, THE GERMAN
SPY WHO SEIZED MATOPPO,
REMOVED TO NEW YORK.
New York.-Accompanled by a de.
tective, Ernest Schiller, the German
stowaway who took possession of the
British steamer Matoppo at sea, ar
rived at pollee headquarters here from
Lewes, DeL
8chiller was questioned by police
officials regarding the Identity of the
four men who, he said, were to have
assisted him in ma alleged plan to
capture the treight steamship City of
Sparts, due to sail for Vladivostok.
Statements by Schiller that the
City of Sparta was to carry a large
amount of money were denied by the
captain, J. McKellar, who said he
never heard of Schiller.
"As for those four German friends
of his," added the captain, "they must
be masquerading as Chinamen, as I
have nobody but coolies in my crew."
Schiller frankly admitted, according
to the police, that he was the leader
of a plot to blow up a Canard liner tn
New York. He said he persuaded four
men to Join him and that they had
planned to board the ship, take poe
session of her at sea and destroy her.
The plot was not carried out, 8chil
ler said, because his confederates
"got cold feet."
Apparently Schiller is not the hus
band of Mrs. Ross Taylor Schiller ofi
Goldsboro, N. C, as he said, his real I
name was Clarence Hudson. He
said his father was an Englishman, I
his mother a German woman and that 1
he was born in Petrograd. His pa
eats separated there and he weat to 4
live with his mother in Germany.
At the outbreak of the war, he I
said, he went to England and obtained
work at a submarine plant at Camber I
l-ad. He stole some submarine plans I
and turned them over to the Germans. I
He was arrested, escaped conviction I
ad came to America. I
Schiller turned over to the pollee I
the Matoppo's papers and =N In Eng. I
WIsh money, which he said he had I
taken from the captain. I
"Tht's all the captain had," he re
whad.t
Schler was in a cheerful mood
bwhen he arrived at headquarters, and
seed to be amused by some of the
o-nes at his exploit. t
"Why, the captain seemed to have e
he idea I was a ferocious giant," he 1
-claimed. "When I met the captaln t
Ssimply pointed my forefinger at him I
mad said 'sit down.' He sat down
ery suddenly. I didn't show my pr-.
.ol to hm or to the mate, who came in a

IMMIGRATION BILL

EXCLUSION RETAINED IN
MEASURE.
Ie Washtington.-The Barnett Immigra
au tion bill, with its literacy test and
he Asiatic exclusion provisions un
ir- changed, passed the House, 308 to 87.
on It now goes to the Senate, where fa
vorable action is regarded as assured.
ce The literacy test, about which the
he fight against the bill had centered,
we was sustained, 284 to 107. This prov
to sion brought vetoes of similar immi
of gration bills by Presidents Cleveland,
Taft and Wilson.
he Representative Burnett, chairman
re of the immigration committee, pre
he dicted there was sufficient strength
he to repass the bill over another veto.
The president has not indicated his
Is purpose to the House leaders.
st Both record votes on the literacy
1 test and on the passage of the bill
w" were without regard to party lines.
ig Majority Leader Kitchin voted for the
sr literacy test and for the bill. Minor.
In ity Leader Mann voted against the
ar literacy test and then for the bill.
id The Humphry reciprocal exclusion
e amendment, aimed at retaliation on
r. British Columbia because of its ex
II- clusion of skilled and unskilled labor
n from this and other foreign countries,
was modified today on discovery that
s- it operated against Russian immigra
Af tion. It was made applicable only to
tl a "contiguous" foreign country.
Ie Asiatic exclusion provisions specif
