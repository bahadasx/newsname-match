OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
AT THE CAPITAL.
(By Congressman C. C. Dill.)
During baby week the National Press
Club of Washington, U. C, gave an en-
tertainment In honor of "baby" con
gressmen, that Is. new member* of the
house, the following twelve were chos
en as ■ wallers:" McLeinore of Texas,
ISiiit of North Carolina, Walsh of Mass
achusetts, Venable of Mississippi.
Meeker of Missouri, Dill of Washing
ton. Gaudy of South Dakota, Sanford
of New York, Klleaton of California,
MeArthur of Oregon, Huddleston of
Alabama and Scott of Michigan.
Speaker Champ Clark acted as god
father ami presided over the meeting.
Kach "baby" was allowed five minutes
in which to "wail." At the close the
following awards were made: The
cutest baby, a rabbit, to Mr. Walsh;
the fattest baby, milk bottle and nip
ple, to Mr. Meeker: the most turbulent
baby, a drum, to Mr. Klleston; the baby
With the brightest smile, a Sunny Jim
■1011, to Mr. Gandy; the most precocious
baby, an A. B. C. book, to Mr. Hud
dleston; the baby with the strongest
lungs, a whistle, to Mr. McArthur; the
most vivacious baby, a rattle, to Mr.
Sanford; the cleanest baby, a cake of
soap, to Mr. Dill; the most bellicose
baby, a cannon, to Mr. Scott; the most
versatile baby (sometimes known as
the administration'! pet), a frog, to
Mr. McLemore: the handsomest baby,
a minor, to Mr. Venable; the best all
round baby, a ball, to Mr. Brltt.
After the "baby" congressmen had
spoken Speaker Clark addressed them
as follows:
"I most heartily congratulate you
gentlemen in being even what are
facetiously denominated 'baby con
gressmen,' It Is a high honor to be
a representative in congress, if for
only one term, and with the number
of terms the honor increases In geo
metrical rather than arithmetical pro
portion. .\ member's usefulness to his
country shoiilil increase in the same
proportion. A man has to learn to be
a representative just as lie must learn
to lie a blacksmith, a carpenter, a
doctor.
"It is an unwise performance for any
district to change representatives at
short intervals. A new congressman
must begin at the foot of the claBS
and spell up. Of, course, the more
brains, tact, energy, courage and in
dustry he has the quicker he will get
up. If lie possess these qualities, and
if hie constituents will keep him in
the house, he is as certain to rise as
the sparks are to fly upward. No
human power can keep him down. It
is only fair and rational to assume that
every representative's constituents de
sire to see him among the "top
notchers.'
"Let us take the present house and
see how long the men who hold the
high places have served. I can not
name all, but will cite a few as samples.
"Mr. Speaker Cannon is serving liis
fortieth year. He holds the record for
length of service in the house in our
entire history. In several congresses
he was chairman of the great commit
tee nn appropriations and then was
speaker eight years, only one man,
Henry Clay, having heen speaker long
er.
"I am serving my twenty-second
year; Majority Leader Mann Is serving
his twentieth year; Mr. Kltchin, chair
man of ways and means, his sixteenth;
Mr. Fitzgerald, chairman of appropria
tions, his eighteenth; Mr. Moon, chair
man of the postofflce and post roads,
Ills twentieth; Mr. Jones, chairman of
insular affairs and 'father of the bOuie,'
his twenty-sixth; Mr. Flood, chairman
of foreign affairs, his sixteenth: Mr,
Hay, chairman of military affairs, his
twentieth; Mr. Glass, chairman of
banking and currency, his sixteenth;
Mr. Adamson, chairman of interstate
and foreign commerce, his twentieth:
Mr. Stephens, chairman of Indian af
fairs, hia twentieth; Mr. Slayden,
chairman of the library, his twentieth;
Mr. Henry, chairman of rules, Ms
twentieth; Mr. Lever, chairman of
agriculture, his sixteenth; Mr. Padgett,
Chairman of the navy, his sixteenth:
Mr. Lloyd chairman of accounts, his
twentieth, and Mr. Sparksman, chair
man of rivers and harbors, his twenty
second. There are other big chair
manships, but these will suffice to
show that as a rule the big places t?o
to old and experienced members, for
most of the men who rank close to the
chairmen are old timers. The same
thing holds good with reference to
tnemberi of the minority. As an Il
lustration, Messrs. Glllett and Cooper,
who are serving their twenty-fourth
year, are the ranking republicans on
appropriations and foreign affairs, al
most certain to be chairmen thereof
should the republicans ever again have
a mnjorlty In the house, as in that
event, in all probability Mr. Mann will
be speaker, unless he is nominated for
president next June.
"Go through the whole list and you
will find, with few exceptions, that the
(nen of long service have the hir!.
places.
"New Kngland and the cities of Phil
adelphia and Plttsburg have under
stood the value of long service all
along, and, having elected a fairly
(food man to congress, they keep him
In the harness.
"The member of longest consecutive
Hervice Is called 'the father of the
house.' Five Phlladelphians In Immi-d
--iate succession liore that honorable
title —Handall, Kelley, O'Neill, Harmer
and Bingrham. Then It went to Mr.
Imlz.-ll of Plttsburg. When 'Gen, BlnK
bam announced the death of Gen.
(farmer, his Immediate predecessor ax
'father of the bouse," he stated that
the five Philadelphia 'fathers of the
Imhi.hc' had nerved a total of 147 years.
and he served 8 or 10 years after mak
ing that Interesting xtatement.
"In the second and third MMTMMI
in which I nerved, Maine, with only
four members, had the »peak<:rHhl|> ami
the chairmanship of the great com
mittees on ways and means, navy and
public ) uildlngs and grounds—a moat
remarkable circumstance, giving the

"I believe that nothing is right.
I believe that everything is
wrong, I believe that I alone
have the right ideas. The town
is wrung, the teachers are wrong.
the things they do are wrong and
they arc doing them in the wrong
way. I believe I could fix things
if tfliey would let me. If they
don't I will get a lot of other fel
lows like myself and we will have
a law passed to make others do
tilings the way we want, them

These four men—ReeJ, Diiißley, Bou

house 20 years or more. Other states

sions—hut I never complained or
kicked. I went to woik as though
those committees suited me exactly.
Here Is an illustration of what may
hap,pen and how luck plays an im
portant part. I was next to top dem
ocrat on both foreign affairs and
patents for eight years—never ad
vanced a peg .so far as committees
went. .lust when, at the beginning of
the ninth year on those two commit
tees, I was about to become top dem
ocrat on foreign affairs, Hon. John
Sharp Williams, then minority leader,
assigned me to the foot of ways ami
means, and at the end of four years
through the happenings of politics In
five different states I jumped from tiie
foot to the head of the democratic
minority on ways and means. So it
may be with you. Events over which
you have no control may advance you
more rapidly than you dream of or
hope for. My advice is this: 'What
ever your hand finds to do, do it with
your might.'"

Although the state of Washiug
ton did not vote for the adminis
tration which has brought about
a business revival, this state is
beginning to get some results from
the constructive legislation of the
Wilson administration.
The new currency system which
prevents panics, and the new tar
iff system which fosters competi
tion by cutting out special privi
leges, have worked wonders in
revival of business, When Presi
• !<• 111 Wilson entered the White
House, stagnation and depression
were country-wide, Now, after
three years, the railroads are noi
able to furnish sufficient freight
ciirs to carry our normal pro
duds to the people of our own
country, let alone the war de
mands by other nations.
Money is easier to borrow than
at any period in the last 10 years.
Every workman who is willing to
work is at work. Farm products
bring remunerative prices. And
the professional office holders of
past years are themselves forced
to •><) to work, for their old jobs
wen; taken from them.
The battle cry of the coming
campaign will depend upon who
titters the cry. Those who were
privileged, ami an' no longer
privileged, want a return to the
old days. Those who produce
Mini sell Ilieir products prefer the
present system. Those who work
with hand or brain like the pres
ent competitive demand for their
Labor, Those who live in the
northwest like the altitude of the
administration in being willing to
open the water powers, the Col
ville reservation, and the unde
veloped resources.

1. The inefficient teacher is
dear at any price.
2. The teacher who knows and
teaches well the subjects assigned,
who knows boys and girls and has
a sympathetic interest in them is
cheap nt any price.
:{. A knowledge of child na
ture, of the fundamental prin
ciples of education, of school or
ganization and management; ob
servation and practice under su
pervision and criticism, coupled
with a thorough knowledge of
subject matter are indispensable
factors in a teacher's preparation.
4. Poor teachers should not
receive positions so long as there
are better teachers available.
'>. The most expert teachers
should be in tin; most difficult
positions.
(i. The more difficult uml more
responsible positions should be
relatively the better paid.
7. The individual genius i>f
the teacher should fit the peculiar
requirements of the position.
m. There should be promotion,
mit only lor meritorious service.
ft. Change of position should
be subject to the satisfaction of
at. lead three requirements i (a)
the good of the school the tencher
is leaving; (b) the good of the
school to which the teacher goes;
(p.) the professional good of the
teacher making the change.
