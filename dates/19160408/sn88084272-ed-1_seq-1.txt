RUMORED INCREASE IN SALT
TAX IRRITATES CHINESE
Pekin, China. April 8 Rumors of
an increase In the salt tax have caused
much complaint among enemies of the
government THe Increase is being 2bn
templated because of the additional ex
pense entailed by the revolution The
output is controled by the salt mo
nopoly The increase probabh will be
alight, but as the annual consumption
of salt in China is nearly 6,000 040.009

3Iay Ship Ovrr Central.
It la known that there is no ban on
commercial shipments via the Mexican
Central railway. That this road haw
not been used before has been due to
the fact that privilege has not been ex
tended for the use of the Mexico North
Western westward from Chihuahua city
to Guerrero and intermediate points.
If. however. Gen. Pershing estab
lishes a new base s Chihuahua city,
there will be no need of the railroad
west of that point The army motor
irucRs could be used to aistribute sup
plies from the Chihuahua base The
shipment of supplies to Chihuahua city
via the Mexican Central would take
about 15 hours. Thence they could be
sent westward bv motor to troops in
the Guerrero district or south to Satevo
and Parral
lnlt to Ship Supplies.
Just as soon as it becomes known that
en Pershing has esraonshed a new
base, business concerns here are ex
pected to begin transporting supplies
over the Mexican Central

to regard the Aguilar announcement at

to placate restive Carrancistas opposed

mercial shipments, as an adjunct to the
motor transport service, are almost as
satisfactory as if the army had tho
privilege of using the Mexican rail-

The whole question is regarded as
based on a technicality which has been
evaded American business men have
asked the quartermaster's department
"..' Ia"o to buy supplies of them for
shipment south. They have been told
that the army is unable to use the
railroad, but that if they care to ship
supplies on their own responsibility,
they are sure to find a purchaser in tho

Bethmann-Hollweg, lord Robert said:
"The chancelor's speech covers much
old ground. As usual, he claims the
allies have no legal right to blockade
Germany, and appears to think the
neutrals are of the same opinion. Yet
among all the neutral governments
who have protested against our action,
none has been found to argue that the
blockade Is In itself illegal, precisely
in the proportion in which it is effec
tive. "That Is Germany s contention. Ger
many has openly proclaimed her in
tention of blockading this country and
has done her best to do so. W nm.
some her action Is justified because It
is Inneffective "
Referring to Dr. von Bethmann
Hollweg s statement that Great Brit
ain alone Is responsible for the con
tinuation ot the war and that he made
proposals last September to which he
had received no reply, lord Robert
said:
Falla to Spread Distrust.
"It may be well to make a clea-. ,.
swer to this. Bv singling out separate
powers among tho allies, the chan
celor endeavors to sow mischief and
distrust among them, but he has failed.
The allies stand together and hare
pledged themselves to make peace in
common. Tho chancelor knows this
well. He knows, too, and the people
of Germany whom he deludes should
know, that nothing in any public
speech he makes can ever form the
basis of peace overtures.
