"OBSERVATIONS"
By Our Man About Town
It was in the post-office and the poor
, old soul had asked if there was a letter
for her.
Only a stifled sigh was heard as she
turned from the window but what did
that sigh mean?
Some son, some daughter, had caus
ed it. Forgetful of their mother in her
declining years is causing her grief
that no other than herself can ever
know because none other than she can
understand.
How many of us, married and long
absent from our paternal homes are ne
glecting our aged parents? I hope not
many. My own mother has told me
how eagerly she awaits my letters, and
while I am not as regular in writing as
I should be, I do not think she ever has
or ever will have any great anxiety be
cause of my neglect.
The United States has been inaugura
ting "Pay Up Week," "Go to Church"
days, "Pay Back What you Borrowed"
days. "Bargain Days," and many
other kinds of special days. Why not
a national "Write Mother Today" day?
Can you even imagine what that.would
mean to thousands of mothers in Amer
ica, or even across the waters?
What a little task it is to write a let
ter! And what a world of good some
letters can do!

MAYOR ALDEN E. CROSS
Re-elected Mayor of the City of East Jordan For a Three-Year Term.
School Commissioner's
Notes
May L. Stewart, Commissioner
We always leave the agent outside
when we are too busy to admit him
He cannot enter now so will have to
make a later engagement.
Seventh grade students may write
on geography and physiology in the
eighth grade examination May H-12. If
successful they will not need to repeat
these subjects next year.
Now is the time for school boards to
hire their teachers for next year. If
you have a good teacher who is capable
in discipline and progressive, it will be
cheaper for you to raise her wages than
to experiment with a new teacher. If
your teacher has made good it is only
courtesy for you to issue an invitation
at this time so that your teacher may
frankly talk over next year's plans with
you and know what to depend on for
next year. If your school is difficult
your teacher may express a desire for
a smaller school for next year and you
may look now for an experienced
and strong teacher for the coming year
If your school has more than fifteen
pupils enrolled, an experienced teach
er should as a rule be hired. The com
missioner wishes to be of all possible
service to school boards in this work.
Arbor day is coming. Several
nurseries and normal schools are giving
trees to school districts for the annual
tree planting.
Drinking fountains are not a necessi
ty to a "Standard School." They are
not required but they are very strongly
recommended.
See notice of teachers examination
in another column of this paper.
The commissioner will be in Boyne
City for office hours April 9th, 10-12 a.
m. at the school house. Regular office
hours outside of East Jordan will then
be discontinued until the opening of
the new school year. . During the
spring rush and summer months all
distinct cases that can not be cared for
by correspondence will be arranged for
in an appointment agreeable to both
parties.
The following circular letter was sent
by the state department to all county
boards of school examiners:
"The county board of school examin
ers shall have the right to renew with
out examination the certificates of any
persons who shall have previously at
tained an average standing of at least
85 per cent in all studies covered in
two or more previous examinations,
and who shall have been since such
last named examination continuously
and successfully teaching in the public
schools.
t "County normal ccrtiiicates subject
to one renewal arc granted upon the
completion of thirty six weeks of nor
mal training. A second renewal may
be granted to holders of county normal
certificates who have received four ad
vanced credits (twelve weeks work in
each subject) at a state normal or other
approved school. This usually requires
two six weeks' terms or one twelve
weeks' term at a state normal or other
school giving similar work.
'To promote professional training
and to encourage a more adequate
preparation of teachers the Department
of Public Instruction recommends that
candidates for nenewals of county
certificates shall file for each renewal
tour advanced credits (twelve weeks'
work in each subject) from a state nor
mal or other approved school. This
usually requires two six weeks' terms
or one twelve weeks term at a state
normal or other school giving similar
work.
"It is further recommended that for
those whose certificates expire
during the year 1917 two credits
(twelve weeks work in each subject)
be substituted for the above require
ment. This usually requires one six
weeks' term at a state normal or other
school giving similar work.
"These recommendations are made
to take effect July l, 1917."
FRED L. KEELER, Supt.
Your request for renewal in? Former
certificate sent in and institute fee for
term of renewal?
Watch the Star school. It's getting
there.
The agent man is knocking at the
door for his later engagement. Would
you grant an interview?
Household Hints
To wash brushes and combs put a
teaspoonful of ammonia in a basin of
hot water and dip the brush up and
down in it, letting the comb remain in
the water for a few minutes. In this
way all the grease will disappear, and
after rinsing in cold water both brush
and comb will be perfectly clean.
When a tag comes off a boot or shoe
lace, press a little melted black sealing
wax around the end of the lace and
shape it to form a tag. Jt wili answer
almost as well as the original.
To renovate a shabby serge skirt,
sponge it over with hot vinegar until
the stains and grease marks disappear;
then thoroughly press on the wrong
side with a fairly hot iron.
Mildew on leather may be removed
with a little pure vaseline. Rub this
into the leather till quite absorbed, and
then carefully polish with a clean cha
mois leather.
Wise Boy
"What are you crying, my boy?"
"Because Billy slapped me."
"But why didn't you slap him back?"
"Because, then it would be his turn
again."

LaLONDE RESIDENCE '
DESTROYED BY FIRE
Both House and Contents Badly
Injured.
The residence of John W. LaLonde,
corner Third and Garfield Streets, was
badly scorched in a fire Saturday even-
ng about 9:00 o'clock. No one was at
home at the time as Mrs. LaLonde was
spending the week with her parents.
The fire evidently got under the build
ing, which had no cellar, and worked
up through the sidings before it was
discovered and an alarm turned in. Our
fire department experienced consider
able difficulty in subduing the blaze
owing to its being between the walls.
Practically all of their household effects
were also destroyed.
The building and contents were both
partially insured, and the adjustment
was made remarkably prompt, the
adjustor coming in Wednesday noon
and allowing the full insurance.
CONTROL POTATO SCAB.
The treatment of seed potatoes with
formaldehyde or with corrosive subli
mate has been recommended for many
years as a preventive of scab and other
diseases carried on the tubers.
Such treatment is, on the whole,
profitable, but has several limitations
which should be clearly recognized to
prevent disappointment, according to
the specialists of the department. The
object of disinfecting seed potatoes is
to destroy the germs of scab and other
surface parasites which might other
wise be planted with the seed and infect
the new crop. Only surface infections
are reached by this method. It is only
partially effective against deep pits of
common scab. Formaldehyde is less
effective than corrosive sublimate
against the black sclerotia or resting
bodies of Rhizoctonia, or russet scab,
and against powdery scab. Neither
chemical, as ordinarily ' used, will
destroy silver scurf. Either one will
kill surface infections of blackleg, but
neither will reach the internal infec
tions common in tubers 'from blackleg
hills. Neither fusarium wilt nor late
blight infection in potato tubers can be
reached by any seed treatment, nor can
any of the nonparasitic diseases of po
tatoes, such as mosaic leaf roll, and
curly dwarf, be prevented. See
Farmers' Bulletin 544 for descriptions
of these troubles.
Clearly, therefore, the most important
precaution against these diseases is to
select clean, disease-free seed potatoes
from healthy, vigorous plants, as de
termined by field inspection during the
growing season and at harvest. Seed
treatment should then be applied as an
additional precaution. It will not be
effective, however, if the soil where
the potatoes are to be planted is already
full of disease.
SOIL CONDITIONS AND POTATO
DISEASES.
Soil conditions have an important
relation to potato tuber diseases, and
many of these are widely spread
throughout the country, perhaps native
to some soils. Common scab is favored
by a neutral or slightly alkaline soil,
and seldom gives trouble in acid soils.
It is therefore increased by liming and
by fresh stable manure, wood ashes,
and alkaline fertilizers, such as nitrate
of soda and ground bone, while acid
phosphate and sulphate of ammonia
tend to diminish scab.
Rhizoctonia occurs to some extent in
nearly all soils, but appears to attack
potatoes most when then the conditions
are unfavorable to the best develop
ment of the potato plant. Bring the
land to an ideal state of tilth to minim
ize loss from Rhizoctonia.
Powdery scab is worst on cold, wet,
or poorly drained soils. Blackleg, on
the other hand, is carried by infected
seed. No potatoes showing a deep
brown discoloration at the stem end
should be planted.
Sulphur tends to prevent common
scab. It is not a substitute for cor
rosive sublimate or formaldehyde, but
is a good drier for cut seed. Applied
to scab-infected soils at the rate of 500
pounds per acre it reduces the scab,
but such heavy applications can not be
generally recommended as profitable.
Preliminary experimental trials are
advised.
HOW TO DISINFECT SEED
The formaldehyde treatment consists
in soaking the pototoes, before cutting,
for two hours in a solution made by
adding one pint of formaldehyde to 30
gallons of water. The solution can be
used repeatedly. The gas treatment is
no longer recommended.
Corrosive sublimate is used at the
rate of 1-1,000 for one and one-half to
two hours. Dissolve 2 ounces of the
salt in hot water and dilute to 15
gallons. This is a deadly poison. Use
with great care. It must also be kept
in wood, porcelain, or glass vessels, as
it attacks metal. It is more effective
than formaldehyde, particularly against
Rhizoctonia and powdery scab. Do not
use the same solution more than three
times, as the strength diminishes with
each lot of potatoes soaked.
To treat large quantities, set several
barrels on a slightly elevated platform.
Fit a plug in a hole in the bottom of
each brrrel, fill with potatoes, cover
with solution, let stand two hours,
draw off solution, and pour into an
other barrel. Increase the number of
barrels in proportion to the quantity to
be treated. Another method is to use
a large wooden vat or trough into which
the potatoes in sacks are lowered by a
rope and pulley and later hauled out,
drained, and dried on slatted racks.
Seed potatoes may be treated several
weeks before planting, provided they
are not reinfected by storing in old
containers or storage bins.
Sprouted potatoes are injured by
treatment, but will thrftw out new
sprouts. In general, however, pota-1
toes will not be injured by the above
directions. Many growers believe
germination is improved by treatment.
LECTURE FOR MEN

Dr. Warthin of U. of M. Coming
to Temple Theatre Sunday
Afternoon.
The first University Extension
Lecture that has ever been sent to East
Jordan will be given at the Temple

ELBERT BEDE SAYS
The self-made man thinks he used
up all the clear timber.
We refuse to convict ourselves upon
our own knowledge of our sins.
When it comes to the pork barrel
there are too many who try to hog it
all.
A lot of long-haired opulist of a few
years are now dyed-in-the-wool demo
crats. The person most to be pitied, in our
estimation, is the joker who gets sore
when it is on him.
What a howl there would be if money
was squandered on a peace project the
way it is on a senseless war.
Just for our own information we wish
to inquire if anyone has heard anythiny
of Mrs. Gait since the honeymoon.
Politics doesn't make crooks and
grafters of men. It merely develops
these traits that were already there.
Did you ever notice how much more
study the slender girl puts into the pro
per manner to cross her lower limbs
than does her more chunky sister.
Talking about the eternal fitness of
things, we read an ad., of Green k
Brown, expert dyers, who have their
place of business on Whiteside street.
In Europe a newspaper for the boys
in the trenches is printed on thin sheets
of dough, so that it may be eaten after
serving its purpose as a newspaper.
Giving the boys inside information at it
were.
A statesman of the present admin
istration has made the statement that
money can be handled more safely by
women than by men. With us it's not
so much a question of safety as of econ
omy. . We wouldn't admit that any other
baby is better than our own because
a better baby would be too good for
this world and we wouldn't wish to
bring any sorrow into the lives .of its
parents.
Nursery Rhymes Recant
Hey, diddle, diddlel
The cat played the fiddle,
The cow jumped over the moon!
And the little dog laughed,
At the contract they made,
To appear in vaudeville soon.
