reliiv to this yovernnieTit 's inuuirv re
garding recent submarine attacks on

lieved that this answer would decide
whether diplomatic relations between
the United States .tint the kaiser should
be broken.
No hint of the document's contents
has arrived. It was handed to Am
bassador (lei'iird yesterday by Eoreign
Minister Vou .lagow. The stale depart
ment's only word that the note has
been given (ieinrd was received from
the United Press.
President Wilson is absent on a week
end trip, (lenrd's dispatch is not ex
pected here before late this afternoon.
Possibly it will not arrive before to
morrow. No action is looked lor un
til Monday.
It was learned that nt the cabinet
meeting yesterday some of the presi
dent's advisors opposed waiting any
longer for promises and assurances
from (lermanv. Tlu'y asserted that tier
many is continuing its submarine activ
ities contrary to' .issurain-cs already
given.
Tney believe diplomatic relations
"hould be promptly severed, Other cab

be given time to prove whether it was
sincere in its recent avowals.
Should Von Jagoiv 's latest reply
quibble, dodge Ihe is.-ue or attempt to

rials think it probable that President
Wilson will not delay longer in execut
ing his thieatencd course. It has been
reputedly stated that Germany must
"conic through" quickly and satisfac
tory or relations will not be continued.

lint German riflemen drove back the
attacks.
Tho Paris ccnimuniquo announced
that mine fighting in Argonne forest
proved advantageous to tho French,
especially near the Daughter of Death
