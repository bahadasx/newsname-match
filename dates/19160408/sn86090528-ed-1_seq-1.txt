IMPORTANT
ARREST BY
CO. SHERIFF
Man Arrested Suspected Rock Island Train
Robber; News Agent Trails Suspect;
Positive in His Identification;
LaFlore Co. Sheriff Coming
Sheriff Hodge Bailey effected
what may prove to be an important
capture yesterday afternoon when he
arrested a man giving his name as O.
E. Clark as he (Clark) disembarked
from Rock Island train No. 23, at the
Chickasha station.
The prisoner is thought to be one
of the two bandits who robbed the
passengers in the smoker of the Rock
Island train, No. 41, just out of Howe,
in La Flore county, on the night of
April 5th, securing $115 in money and
a number of valuable watches.
Clark's arrest was brought about
through H. A. Terrill, who was the
news agent on the train the night of
the stick-up.
Terrill stated to the officers that he
saw the man in Oklahoma City yes
terday and recognized him as one of
the robbers. He trailed him about the
city and to the Rock Island passenger
station and when Clark bought a tick
et for Chickasha, Terrill boarded the
train with him. At El Reno, Terrill
endeavored to get into communication
with Rock Island officers. Failing in
this he again boarded the train with
the man whom he suspected and came
on with him to Chickasha. Rock Is
land special officers at El Reno,
learning the facts in the case, wired
Sheriff Bailey to meet the train and
arrest the suspect.
When the train arrived in Chicks sha
Sheriff Bailey and Deputy Castleman
w ere on the ground and Terrill, point
ing out the man suspected, Clark was
placed under arrest and taken to the
Grady county jail.
Sheriff Bailey wired Sheriff Carl
Wagoner of La Flore county, at Po
teau. receiving a reply late yesterday
evening that he (Sheriff Wagoner)
and Conductor Buchanan of the train
whose passengers were robbed, would
be in Chickasha this afternoon for the
purpose of identifying the suspect.
H. A. Terrill,, the news agent whose
sleuthing brought, about the arrest, is
positive in his identification of Clark.
He says that he cannot be mistaken;
that the man's general appearance, hib
dark, wavy hair and keen block eyes
are indelibly impressed upon his mem
ory. In addition to identifying Clark
from his general personal appearance,
Terrill was positive in his assertion
that the overalls and jumper found in
Clark's grip nt the time of his arrest
are the same garments worn by one
of the robbers.
Clark is alleged to have made a
number of contradictory statements
to the sheriff's officers as to where he
lives. He stated, however, umt he
came here from Coalgate.
The suspect is a man of about 25
years of age; about five feet, six or
seven inches tall and weighs approxi
mately 3o pounds. He has keen black
eyes, black, wavy or curley hair and
is dressed fairly well. Search at the
jail showed the prisoner to be unarm
ed. Only a few dollars in change was
found upon his person. He is reticent
And non-communicative, but has made,
the officers state, a number of con
tradictory statements as to where he
lives, where he came from to Chicka
sha and why he came tw-Chiekasha.
When arrested the suspect had in
his possession a new leatner suit case
in which was a pair of cotton work
ing pants, a black sateen work shirt,
a pair of mud-stained overalls, a jump
er, also mud-stained, and a white col
lar which had been laundrled but
which had upon it no laundry marks.
No watches, jewelry or pawn tickets
were found in the prisoner's belongings,
RAPID RISE
IN RATES
ON OCEAN
Costs Much More to Transport Grain Than
' Two Years Ago; Provisions and
Flour are Also Materially
Affected
SHORTAGE OF SHIPS
ATTRIBUTED CAUSE
War Calls for Vessels for Naval Purposes,
Curtailing Number Available for
Carrying Trade; Subs and
Mines Figure In It
Washington, D. C, April 8 In a
letter to Hon. Josliua W. Alexander,
Chairman of the House Committee on
the Merchant Marine and Fisheries,
Dr. E. E. Pratt, Chief of the Bureau of
Foreign and Domestic Commerce, De
partment of Commerce, calls atten
tion to the rapid rise in ocean freight
rates from American ports. A special
point is made of the remarkable rise
in the rates on grain, one of the prin
cipal American exports. This increase
from Js'ew Y'ork to Liverpool in the
last two years has been about 900 per
cent, while the increase in the rate on
flour has been 500 per cent and the in
crease on provisions only 40 per cent.
The more rapid increase on grain is
accounted for by the fact that in or
dinary imes grain is carried at es
pecially low rates because of its de
sidability as ballast and because it can
easily be taken on and discharged.
The shortage of ships that has led
to the remarkable increases in ship
ping rate3 is attributed to the follow
ing causes in the letter to the commit
tee: (1) The elimination of the mer
chant ships of German?- and Austria
Hungary; (2) the withdrawal of
merchant ships for military and naval
purposes; and (3) the loss of ships
through submarine and mining oper
ations. The letter is the most complete re
port on the subject of ocean freight
rates that, has yet been published. It
includes detailed reports from the
bureau's district offices in New York,
Boston, New Orleans, San Francisco
and Seattle, as well as data compiled
at the bureau in Washington. A stu
dy of the many tables of rates reveals
some interesting variations in the
rates from different ports.
In January. 1914, the rate on grain
from New York and Boston to Liver
pool was 4.1 cents per bushel; one
year later the rate from New York to
Liverpool was 18.3 cents and from
Boston to Liverpool 13.2 to 15.2 cents
per bushel. In January, 1916, the rate
from New Y'ork to Liverpool was 40.6
ANSWER TO
SERIOUS
CHARGES
Charles Speck, living in the Rush
Springs neighborhood, was arraigned
before Judge Davenport, of the county
court this morning, and held in bonds
in the sum of $200 to answer to charg
es of carrying knuck3 and other con
cealed weapons, and in bonds in the
sum of $500 to answer to charges of
u.ilawful possession of liquor. The
bonds were returnable the first day of
May.
Speck's arrest comes as a sequence
to a free-for-all fight at a dance sev
eral weeks ago in which he (Speck)
was beaten and cut rather . severely.
W. 3. Beach was arrested immediately
following the trouble, charged with
assaulting Speck. Beach will have his
preliminary hearing in Judge Daven
port's court this afternoon. It is stat
ed that a large number of witnesses
for both the defense and the state will
be present at this hearing.
Speck is alleged to have been laid
up from the injuries received in the
fight, and unable to be brought into
court until today.
The state will, it is alleged, e-ndeav-or
to show that Speck had whiskey
in his possession ou the night of the
i dance. -
cents per bushel and from Boston to
Liverpool it was 34.5 to 36. r cents.
From these data it appears that the
rates on grain from New York to Liv
erpool was, in January, 1916, about
ten times as htgb as in January, 1914,
while the rate from Boston Liverpool
was only nine times are great. . In Jan
uary of the present year grain could
be shipped from 4 to fi cents per
bushel less from Boston than from
New York. The higher rate from Now
York is probably due to the long de
lays and high demurrage charges re
sulting from the present congestion at

BELOW FREEZING
With a flip "and a flop the mercury
descended down and down last night
until the morning's sun arose and
shone down upon little puddles of wa
ter which had battled all night long
with the biting winds from the north
to be finally coated over with a thin
layer of ice.
Agent Cooper of the agricultural de
partment stated this morning that the
chances are that the fruit crop was
not ihj'ired by the freeze, the mercury
falling not lower than two degrees be-
low freezing. Corn, however, that has
shown its tips above the earth's crust
possibly succumbed to the ravages of
.lack Frost and some of it. mav have
to be replanted.
SPENDING MONEY FOR WIFE
W. H. Earle marketed five hogs in
Chickasha this morning which jointly
weighed 2076 pounds and netted the
owner $181.65.
Mr. Earle resides 8 miles from
Chickasha. He stated to County
Weigher Lee McReynolds this morn
ing that he is feeding 250 more hogs,
which he expects to market later on.
The hogs sold today were fattened
on alfalfa and finished on corn and
were top notchers in every respect.
Mr. Earle said that he was "coming
to Chickasha anyway today and just
thought he'd brings this little bunch
of pigs along in order to get a little
spending money for his wife."

Rooms; Well Lighted
The Junior High School will he built
on the block between Idaho and Ore
gon avenues, and Sixth and Seventh
streets.
The members of the Chickasha
board of education arrived at an agree
ment in this matter shortly after 12
o'clock today, after having been in
session over an hour and following a
session which lasted all yesterday af
ternoon. The final vote showed Cralle, Cloud
and Bettis voting for, and Melton
against the site chosen.
Five prospective sites were consid
ered by the board, as follows: Block
known as the Lugiubyhl property, be
tween Colorado and Iowa avenues,
priced asked $6,300; block immediate
ly east of the Ed Johns residence,
price asked, $3,800; block immediate

kota avenue- Price askecl 'im the
site selected, price asked $8,150.
The junior high school building
will be an innovation upon the lines
of architecture usually found in school
buildings in this, section of the coun
try. Using the language of L. R. Alder
man, superintendent of city schools,
at Portland, Oregon, "Out west where
folks are all agreeable to trying
things, they've invented the one story
school house and the idea seems like
ly to spread wherever the building
area makes its adoptiop practicable."
The members of the Chickasha
board of education have investigated
the one story proposition; they have
seen that it is practicable; they have
the building area sufficient to carry
out the building scheme and they are
.willing to try and test the merits of
the one story school building, as
claimed by those who have tried them.
The junior high school building of
Chickasha will be constructed upon
the unit plan. This plan admits of
such additions, from time to time, as
tun increase in the school population
mav demand. Ultimately the struc
ture will assume the form of a com
n'ete quadrangle with the sides
slightly longer than the ends.
As the building will be originally
constructed, however, it will be in the
