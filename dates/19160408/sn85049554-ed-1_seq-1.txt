Villa's Power Obliterated.
The American troopa1 have accom
plished their object ift Tirtftroying
Villa's military power and should
withdraw from Mexico without delay,
was the view expressed by a Carranaa
official today.
"The punitive force has done all that
it could expeot to do. Itbas shattered
Villa's force, robbed him of all__prest
tlge and power- (he ever held among
the people. The peons may be ignor
ant -but they ar» not fools". .They will
never again rtapect a man who turned
tall andran like a coward before thfc
Yankees.
"Meantime it must, be admitted that
the''Mexican people have behaved well
toward the American troops. But to
allow them to remain -indefinitely, 20,
000 men hunting .for a single bandit,
is another matter.. To allow them to
continue southward, indefinitely is still
more serious.V
"Americans would not tolerate the
presence of a Canadian Hnnilltary"
force
within their borders. The presence of
Americans is beginning to irritate the
Mexican people. It looks like a sur
render of sovereignty. With Villa
crushed, n.ow Is the logical time for the
punitive forces to withdraw*" So far
the affair has turned out fortunately
for both sides ".
Villa May Be at Parral.
Information from Mexican sources
today said" that Francisco Villa had
reached PArral and had sent emis
saries into the town'to1 test the-spirit
of the garrison and' also to secure
provisions. As usual with such re
port sf no verification -was possible, but
the fact thht -$he bandit was reliably
reported to 'have been only $fty-flve
miles from Parral two days ago gave
color to the story.
This information served «t least to
act as a considerable damper on the
observer who returned today from hope of those who thought the ban
dit's career might be ended* by another
brilliant dash on the part of the Am
erican troopers who hive pushed south
of Satevo. Army officers say that "a
repetition of Colonel Dodd's exploit
was unlikely owing to the great dis-
Gr.sixty mlles
of the Am-
within Afty or. sixty miles of the Am
ericans.
May Become Endurance Test.
If .he Ibas reached Parral is ex-,
pected that th^.chase must set down
to a steady grind, with the issue to be
an endurance test between 'the (troop
ers and the. bandits.
The daahing of~fBe-hopea.of a speedy
termimation of the expedition~has griv
en no alarm to the rumorists on the
border. The stories of the massing of
Carranza troops 4n proximity to 'the
international line, wfoich had died

No Campaign of Aggression to Bs
Waged Against United States, Can

Germany Will Be Sufficiently Occu
pied Restoring Industries.
Berlin, via London, April 8.—Recent
dispatches have brought word of a
statement in the Canadian parliament
and the Canadian newspapers that Ger
many was planning-after this war to
plunge In the American continent and
demand the cession of the dominion.
In a conversation with Herr von
Jagow, minister of foreign affairs, the
Associated Press correspondent referred
'to these rumors.
"How can people invent or believe
such stories?" asked Herr von Jagow.
"To anyone not entirely blinded by pas
sion it is evident that Germany nevtr
pursued such senseless aims.
"One can not imagine a state of af.
fairs in Europe after the war such that
we should have a free enough hand to
divert our strength and efforts to such
a task on the American continent.
Not to Attack Monroe Doctrine.
"Equally ridiculous, tho unfortunately
this phase has a serious side, ure ru
mors which I underdsrtand here and
there are current in the United States,
that Germany after the "jvar will take
revenge on the United States by pur
suing an anti-American policy. It is
reported to me that apprehensive souls
in America foresee an attempt by Ger
many to break down the Monroe doc
trine and plant Its*, flag in Sou or
Central America, or even apon the
United States and crush them to ob
tain mastery of both continents..
"I n^ed hardly assure you such re
portsj-^whicli: from time -to tim» Have
been set "afloat, by! enemies of Germany
in the evident intention of stirring up
feelings against it, are too abnuivl for
denial. I need only recall that Germany
has never placed itself in opposition to
the American. principle of the Monroe
doctrine.
.Points to Mexico.
"Agfain, I would ask American doubt
ers to remember the attitude of Ger
many during the Mexicah crisis. All
the German commercial Interests were
involved alid there was demand to pro
tect those interests, but the imperial
government at all times stood for
American control of the situation.
"It is unfortunately true that during
the war, when the thoughts of every
German are bound up heart and soul
against a world-wide coalition, the at
titude of the Washington government at
times has almost forced us. We think
that there might be some basis for stor
ies or an understanding of soiBe sort
between Washington and the allies. A
strong feeling of resentment and bitter
ness against the United States has
sprung up among the masses in Ger
many.
.Foolish to Talk Revenge.
"Unfortunately, too, there are foolish
persons among us who talk darkly of
'taking revenge' upon the United States,
but no responsible official tukes or
cares to take $uch a view.
"We shall hav* quite enough to do
at home to restore our industrial and
trade without re-
taking on a new and powerful enemy
across the Atlantic."
