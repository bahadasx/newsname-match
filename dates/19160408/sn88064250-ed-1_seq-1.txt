cer Bryant., negro youth .
Young Vidrine, together with his
brother, Gilbert, and two friends,
Holbrook and Anderson, was walk
ing down Market street, when he
encountered the negro youth. It is
said that the negro bunmped into
the whites and was remonstrated
for his action, whereupon he seized
his pistol. The white boys seeing
that Bryant had a weapon remarked
that he should be brought to the of
ficers; thereupon Bryant shot Mar
shall Vidrine, tahe bullet piercing his
heart; he lived but a few minutes.
The lifeless body of the young
man was brought to the home of
Mrs. Alphonse Reed, from which
place the funeral took place on
;'. Tuesday evening at four o'clock, in

thought to be in the woods near the
Jack Thompson place, a short dis
tance from Opelousas, where the
*_heriff is supposed to have located
him on Tuesday morning. The
woods are so thick, however, that it
will require some time to capture
the black; many fear that he will
effect his escape.
Should the negro be captured it
is understood that he will be taken
to jail at Lafayette, so as to pre
vent any disturbance, although it
is not likely that he would be harm

the deceased are perfectly willing
to allow the law to take its course.

the past several months and was
looked upon as a well behaved
young man.
PARKER TO ADDRESS
MORNING MEETINi
Progressive Candidate for Governor
to Be Main Attraction Here
PARKERITES EXPECT TO HAVE
LARGE CROWD PRESENT
Bull Moose Chief Will Make His
First Political Speech of Cam
paign in This City Saturday
John M. Parker the Progressive
candidate for governor of Louis
iana will hold his first' political
meeting in this city on Saturday
A. M. at 11 o'clock. His pupport
throughout the parish are expected
to attend the rally in a large body
and it is the intention of local Par
kerites to make this one of the
greatest political gatherings of the
present campaign.
Mr. Parker has spoken to Opelou
sas audiences on several occasions
and has always made a favorable
impression; his speech rere two
years ago before the state conven
tion of the Louisiapa Farmers'
Union was considered a splendid
one; he was complimented for his
intelligent discourse of the various
needs of the Loutsiana farmers.
That a large number of Pleasant
people will attend this meeting is
a certainty, as those who are op
posed to Mr. Parker's political
views are anxious to hear the Bull
Mooser discuss his platform.
Parker enthusiasts are claiming
this parish by a handsome majority;
they are claiming the first ward by
a safe margin, -while the Pleasant
forces feel confident that-the Demo
cratic nominees will carry this
ward by at least one hundred and
fifty votes. The Pleasant support
ers claim the fourth by a good
majority, while the Parker people
think that they have a splendid
chance of carrying this ward; the
second and third wards, claimed by
large majorities by the Parkerites,
are conceded for the Moosers by
a small margin; the fifth ward is
considered as disputable, both sides
claiming, while the sixth ward is
likely to go one way or the other.
Mr. Parker's tour of St. Landry
is expected by 'his supporters to aid
his cause materially, while the
Pleasantites feel confident that no
more vot'es can be taken away from
them.
Mr. Parker was billed to address
the voters of various sections of
Evangeline and St. Landry parishes
on Friday and Saturday, but his
principal meeting will be held in
tlhis city this morning, when it is
expected that the Bull Moosers.will
rally to their cause every possible
man.

Record Breaking Crowd Expected To Hear Ex-Governor
Appeal For Votes For Ruffin G. Pleasant
OPELOUSAS MEETING TO BEi GREAT
Eloquent Political Orator Will Stir Democrats of St. Lan
dry to Action by Speech He Will Deliver at Courthouse
on Monday Night in Behalf of Party Nominees.
Jared Y. Sanders, one time gov
ernor of Louisiana and candidate
for the United States Senate four
years ago against Robert S. Brous
sard and Arsene Pujo, will speak at
Prairie Basse de Grand Coeau on
next Monday afternoon and at Ope
lousas on Monday night. The grand
Coteau meeting will be preceded by
an old time barbecue.
Congressman Ladislas Lazaro
from the seventh district will ac
company Ex-Governor Sanders in
St. Landry and will speak at Grand
Coteau and Opelousas. These two
well known politicians are expected
to bolster the Pleasant cause con
siderably.
"J. Y." has always been strong in
this pariSh, carrying it by
nice majorities every
-time he ran for offiec and there is
no doubt that he still has numer
ou~ friends here. He is recognized
as one of the best stump speakers
in,Louisiana.and.has the faculty of
holding the interest of his audi
ences at all times. His speeches in
St. Landry are awaited with anx
iety by the Pleasant forces, as it is
pointed out that Mr. Sanders will
bring over to the Democrats several
hundred voters.
Mr. Sanders will draw a crowd as
large, if not larger than the crowd
expected at the Parker. meeting
Saturday. That he will do
some good for the Pleasant cause
is a foregone conclusion, according
to local Democrats.
The local Democratic club urged
the secretary of the state Demo
cratic executive committee to send
Sanders to this parish, because it
realized that this eloquent
political orator, who has always
drawn large audiences in St. Lan
dry, would bring votes to the
cause; his meeting here Monday
night. is expected to be so largely
attended that it is. hardly probable
that he will be:able to speak in the
courthouse. It is likely that he will
have to hold an open air meeting,
so as to be heard by all who will
journey to Opelousas, from the sur
rounding country, as well as the
several hundred of voters of his
precinct who will attend the biggest
Democratic meeting held here in
four years.
. Congressman Lazaro will arrive
in Opelousas within the next couple
of days, having come from Wash
ington, at the beckoning of the
members of the party, which has
honored him to one of the highest
political positions.
Dr. Lazaro will make an active
campdign of the seventh district
during the next week; at the same
time that he will be campaigning
for the Democratic nominees he
will try to bolster up his political
fences, as he has two opponents,
who will contest for. his Job at the
Fall congressional election.

Democratic Committee Selects Men
to Represent st. La.:nary
DEMOCRATS URGED TO
STAND BY NOMINEES
Interesting Session of Parish Demo- I
cratic Executive Conmnittec Was
Held Here Last Saturday
An interesting and animated sas
sion of the parish democratic exe
cutive committee was held in the
assessor's office in the cou:Lruou3c
on last Saturday at 12 o'clock nomon.
The two parochial democratc
factions wanted the delegation to
the state convention at Baton
Rouge and for that reason an inter
esting squabble ensued, when itwaas
finally decided' to amicably sel~ t
the eighteen delegates to represet
St. Landry at the Baton Rouge con
vention next May. R. Lee Garland
anid John W. Lewis were appointed
by the committee to place in nomi
nation eighteen delegates, after a r
resolution empowering the body to t
appoint these delegates had been
unanimously adopted. After that,
there was no more squabble and
every body was satisfied at the ap
pointments made.
Following is the resolution t
adopted by the committee, together
with the names of the delegates
chosen:
Whereas, the state central com
mittee of the democratic party at c
its meeting held in the city of New
Orleans on the 9th day of February, c
passed a resolution authorizing and I
directing the severil parishes of a
the state to select delegates to the I
democratic state convention to be a
held at Baton Rouge, La., on the a
23rd day of May, 1916, said conven- i
tion to be held for the purpose of d
nominating a president of that r
party; and
Whereas, the resolution aforesaid I
authorized the several parish demo
cratic committees to select them
selves such delegates, or cause the
same to be selected by mass meet-' t
ing, etc; and t
Whereas, in the.opinion ofý this
committee the most economical, ex
oeditious and practical way to sel
ect such delegates is for this com- ,
mittee as a whole to select the same, t
such method having been hereto- e
fore pursued by said committee e
and by nearly all of the democratic 1
committees which have thus far a
selected their delegates in the sev- (
eral palrishes.
Therefore, be it resolved, that the
following named are hereby select- i
ed, appointed and delegated to re-_
present the parish of St. Landry at
the Democratic State Convention, to
be held at Baton Rouge on the 23
day of May," A. D. 196: r
Leon S. Haas, G. L. Dupre, E. K. 1
Eastham, J. M. Sanders, D. M. Fon
tenot, Yves Andrepont, A. L. And
rus, H. E. Estorge, Frank Fontenot,
R. Lee Garland, John W. Lewis, J.
G. Lawler, L. Austin Fontenot, Dr.
E. S. Barry, F. A. Smith, Henry
Lastrapes, Jr., Dr. C. A. Gardiner
and Frank M. Ables.
Be it further resolved, that the
deleagtes hereinabove appointed, sel
ected and delegated vote as a unit
on all questions coming up before
said convention such as the selec
tion of delegates to the National
Convention, etc.,
Be it further resolved, that the
delegates hereinabove selected shall
have the right and are hereby em
powered by written instrument to
appoint proxies in their place and
stead.
Be it furtFier resolved, that a
copy of this resolution, duly authen
ticated by the Secretary and Chair
man of this committee shall consti
tute the credentials of the dele
gates hereinabove appointed.
Whereas, the Democratic party of
the state of Louisiana and its nomi
nees at the approaching general
election, are being opposed by a
combination of Progressives, Re
publicans and so-called Independ
ent Democrats; and
Whereas, the enemies of the party
are attempting to influenoe away
from the party nominees, theee
who participated in
such nominations at the primary
election on January 25th; and
Whereas, it'is the judgment and
sense of this committee that all
true democrats shoeld promptly
and energetically come to the aid:
of the party and its nominees at
the approaching general electioni,
and that it is politically wrong and
horally reprehensible for demo
crats who participated in the selec
tion of the nominees to repudiate
the result of the primary election.
Therefore, be it resolvaed, that
this committee here and now calls

Interesting Meeting Is Held at the
Courthouise on Monday Night to
Discuss Parish School Rally
A well attended meeting was held
at the courthouse on Monday nigitt
for the purpose of discussing ways
and means by which the Seventh j
St. Landry Parish School Rally
could be held in this city next :
month.
Dr. R. M. Littell called the meet
.g to order, and after maring a
sittirt address in behalf of the rally
idflrtuced the speakers.
1hSyor Loeb, E. K. Easthar:, L. L.:-i
Perrault, W. F. Brown and otters
made appropriate talks and roused
those present to immediate action. '
Mr. Brown was complimented for(
having secured an appropriation of
seventy-five dollars from the par-=i S
ish police jury; this is the first::
time in the history of St. Landry;i"
that the police jury has voted an
appiropriation for the benefit cf the.i
school rally. The city council tmade :
an appropriation for the same cause.
on Tuesday night of twenty=flve
dollars.
For the past six years Prof. Pres
cott and Prof. Griffith have been
keeping up the ,athletic spirit : -ri
among the students of St. Landry
but the rallies held annually becamae
a strenuous affair to be pulled ofn,
as financial conditions could not.. ,
permit continu4nce of this splen
did feature of Che schools of )hi
parish.
Now, however, with the city a.d
parish co-operating with the sohoot.
officials it is expected that the par
ish rallies will prove popular fro.m
henceforth.
