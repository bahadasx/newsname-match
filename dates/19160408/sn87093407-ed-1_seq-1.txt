CHIEF LANG IN TROUBLE AGAIN
Police Make No Progress in Murder Mystery
STATE OF WASHINGTON
WILL OFFER REWARD IN
. SEATTLE MURDER CASE
Governor, in Seattle, Says
Slayer Must Not Go Un
punished; Police Have
New Theory.
Aroused by the atrocious nature of the
double murder of Mrs. Corinne Wheeler
and Miss Katie Swift, Gov. Ernest Lister Sat
urday conferred in Seattle with Prosecuting
Attorney Lundin with a view to offering a
state reward for the arrest and conviction
of the murderer.
"The brutality of the crime," the gover
nor said, "makes it especially imperative that
the guilty one be apprehended. If anything
the state can do, by way of offering a re
.ward, can aid in obtaining such a result, it is
my purpose that it shall be done.
"It is not so much from a desire for re
venge—tho the fiend in the case deserves
little sympathy- but the object of society's
law is to deter others from crime. This ob
ject is seriously hampered whenever a mur
der of such an atrocious nature remains a
mystery, and the murderers go un
hampered."
After 60 hours of investigation, the po
lice have made no progress toward solution
of the Wheeler-Swift murder mystery.

Altho It has been establlahed
that the women told neighbors thev
were being watched from the apart

that an unknown man stole Into

mained there on the night of the
murder, the police are Inclined to
give thla phase of the myatery lit

Oiacredlt Robbery Theory
They say that if thev accept all
surh evidence, their problem would
become too complicated.
After checking over the legal pa
pers found In th» home of the wom
en, Captain of Detectives Tennant
has concluded, he says, the women
did not have more than $300 or
$400 In cash. He is Inclined, there
fore, to discredit the theory that
robbery was the motive of the in
truders.
One note was found written on n
piece of ruled stationery and signed
by H. .1. King, the nephew, showing
he borrowed $LTi from Mrs. Wheeler
the day before the murder.
Many of the neighbors said Fri
day the two sislera were peculiar
in their habits, and were believed
by many to be destitute.
Johnny Hmlth. who delivered a
paper at the women's home, says
the shade was drawn down at 4

He did not remember ever seeing

Mrs. Jorgenson, a neighbor, who
snld Thurndny she hail seen one of

murder) concluded Friday that, it

About the only definite conclu
