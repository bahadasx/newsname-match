Evening.
TAX KICKING IS HABIT
CITIZENS NOT INTERESTED
Committee May Hold Sessions
Which Citizens Will Be Urged
to Attend.
at
Kicking ou taxes is a habit.
This was pointed out last evening
at an open meeting of the Commer
cial club, called for the purpose of
discussing taxes, appointing a com
mittee to assist the city assessor and
to discuss the city taxes.
About 50 men attended the meet
ing.
Committee Named.
The following committee was
named to assist T. J. Lloyd, city as
sessor, with the assessing of real es
tate property: H. E. Reynolds,
chairman, C. E. Battles, George
Kreatz, Charles Warfield and Dr. R.
Gilmore.
The Bemidji Merchants association
will name a committee to assist As
sessor Lloyd in the assessing of per
sonal property taxes.
Many Discussions.
The meeting was called to order by
E. H. Denu,. president of the Com
mercial club. Among those who
took part in the discussions were A.
P. Ritchie, F. S. Lycan, Maurice Kap
lan, City Assessor T. J. Lloyd, T.
Johnson, E. A. Barker, G. E. Carson,
H. E. Reynolds, George Kreatz, J.
J. Opsahl, E. H. Winter, Attorney
E. E. McDonald, J. P. Lahr, Dr. R.
Gilmore.
Question of Morals.
It was pointed out in the discus
sion that taxation is a matter of
morals. Listing property is a mat
ter of common honesty, or honor, or
fair play. The taxpayer who escapes
with less than his just share of the
tax burden is just as much of a thief
as the pickpocket. The man who
dodges $5 or $5,000 is robbing his
honest neighbors, just as culpably as
if he were dodging the payment of
$5,000,000 and thereby doubling the
tax of all the people in his ward or
township.
Lie to Assessor.
It was stated that many a man
who would scorn to beat his neigh
bor in a horse trade, who would
scorn to give shortage in weight and
who would die before he would short
change a customer, will lie to the as
sessor and rob his friends by failing
to pay his share of the taxes and
never stop to think how mean and
dishonest he has been.
There must be a finer sense of
honor among the men and women be
fore the tax question is worked out.
Assessor Lloyd told of the grading
of the city for real estate taxes. He
stated that it was hard to get an
equal valuation and that if a good
stiff valuation is made the lower the
tax rate will be. A low tax rate is
an inducement to people on the out
side.
Take No Interest.
J. P. Lahr urged that citizens take
more interest in tax matters. He
stated that he had been on.the city
council and school board for a num
ber of years, but the citizens did not
appear interested enough to investi
gate the levies and discuss them.
When they have to pay the levy, how
ever, they blame the assessor. He
praised the work of Assessor Lloyd
last year and stated that Assessor
Lloyd's grading of lots was very
good. A lot in the business district
is unquestionably worth more than a
lot in the residence district. The
main difficulty is the distinction of
a business and resident lot. "Taxes
are high, we must admit," said Mr.
Lahr, "but property must be as
sessed."
The committees appointed to assist
Assessor Lloyd will assist him in
scaling the real estate and the per
sonal property taxes. The commit
tee may hold open meetings at which
citizens will be invited to attend.

ON SUNDAY LID
New Ordinance Goes Into Effect in
Thief River Falls
Tomorrow.
Thief River Falls, Minn., April 8.
The ordinance for the regulation
of amusement places in mis city
marking the completion of the fight
initiated by Mayor Campbell when he
first took office to close the amuse
ment parlors on Sunday, is now in
effect and the first day for its en
forcement will be tomorrow when it
is expected that some fight will be
made by the proprietors of the places
affected. It is anticipated that the
owners of the pool halls, skating
rinks, bowling alleys that come un
der regulation have a trump card up
their sleeves to play at the opportune
moment.
Would Close Everything.
Mayor Campbell when he first took
office wanted to close all the amuse
ment places on Sundays, but found
this was practically impossible ac
cording to the ordinances then in ef
fect, and was forced to modify his
demands. The owners of the amuse
ment places on the other hand have
held that they should be allowed to
do business on the Sabbath just as on
any other day. Neither side has won.
The places will be allowed to open
Sunday afternoon for five hours,
from 1 to 6 o'clock, as a compro
mise.
Places Limited.
Other features of the new ordinance
are that the places of amusement are
limited to one for each 1,000 popula
tion, thus with five places, two bil
liard halls, two bowling alleys, and
the skating rink in operation here, no
more can enter. Each one of the pro
prietors has to obtain a license and
have capable sponsors. Each place has
to close at 10 p. m., and remain closed
until 5 a. m. each week day.
