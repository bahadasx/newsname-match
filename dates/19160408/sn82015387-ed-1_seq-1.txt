ing nothing but thoroughbred pigas,
principally the Duroc Jersey. The
Covington bank; are lending money
for the purchase of these pigs at 6
per cent interest on endorsed notes

These things all together are giving

of the farm.

catlons of an oil field of big enough
promise, and expressing confillnce
that oil would be found, and that
Covington would boom in conse
quence.
A toast was offered by Dr. Grim

eral and Manufacturing Company.
who spoke feelingly of the optimistic
character of Mr. Sassinot, wh3 s4*
,eral short weeks before his eihath
was with us here in Covington. He
said that Mr. Sassinot had etated to
aim on the Thursday preceding his
death, "If I could only live to see
oil in St. Tammany parish, I would
die contented." Dr. Grimmer re
gretted that Mr. Sassinot h`a not
-been spared to witness the starting
of the well. He toasted to its suc

COMMITTEES IN
WATERWORKS
AND SCHOOL
MATTERS
Request for Election for Wa
terworks for Town of
Covington Granted
by the Council.
SCHOOL MATTER PRE
SENTED BY SCHWARTZ
Capt. Weaver's Proposition
to Take Over and Main
tain Wharf Laid On
the Table.
The meeting of the Covington
town council last Tuesday-was quite
a busy one, several very important
matters coming up. The ordering
of an election for the purpose of vot
ing a tax for wateriorks, appears
in this issue of The Farmer, with
the ordinance in full. There see~ms
to be but small opposition and it is
safe to say the election will be car
ried for waterworks. The matter
was brought up by E. J. Domergue,
E. O. Davis and H. A. Mackle, who
appeared as a committee from the
Association of Commerce.
Capt. D. H. Weaver proposed to
the town to take charge of the what f
and keep it in condition, if he was
given exclusive use of same. This
request was tabled.
It was intended to present and or
dinance levying atax on vehicles and
t-utomobiles, but so much had to b.
disposed of that the' matter was neg
lected.
A CO1a1LCOee iruou UAW rily,
School Board, composed of President
N. H. lFitzSimons, Superintendent
Lyon and Adrian D. Schwartz, at
torney for the Board, appeared be
fore the council for the purpose of
securing a recognitlon of indebted
ness due the CoVington high- school
by the town council to the extent
of about $2000, which is needed to
defray the payment of the amount
due on the school furniture.
Both Mr. FitaSimons and Mr.'
Lyon discussed with the counnll the'
necessity for some immediate action!
of their part. They wire followed
by Mr. Schwartz, who splk,3 In partt
a- follows:
'Two years ago I was a member
of the same committee which pre
sented this claim to the conec I rela
tive to the purchase of the necessary
s lreol furniture to equip th:', oviug
t Un high school, and at'that timle this
bod. appropriated $50V, aol is was
the understanding that the bal~n.ce
of the debt contracted for would be
.aken care of by the council withr::,
eirbarassment to the School Board:
Ti'l Indebtedness was po.trncet-d on
the strength of assurance~ which
were given by this counol.
"While we appreelate that- at the
present the town is hampered on ac
count of the lack of funds with
which to meet its obligations, still,
it would mean much to relieve the
embarassment which exists with re
spect to the school furniture claim,
to have the town recognize the in
debtedness and put it in tangible
shape, so that it could be taken care
of out of future budgets. It would
be sufficient if the interest on the
claim to the extent of about $200
could be taken care of at present.
"And now, gentlemen, in connec
tion with the question of future bud
gets, we are confronted with a very
serious proposition. I refer to the
hopelessly Irregular and crippled
condition into which the assessments
of the town of Covington have de
toriated, and which make it abso.
lutely necessary that some action be
taken by this body at once to have
it corrected.
"You are the sworn administra
tors of this community, and the re
sponsibility rests at your doors for
the fact that the corporation is in
an apparehtly insolvent state, due to
no other cause than a careless and
negligent condition existing in the
assessment rolls. -The assessments
should be equalized, not raised; and
if they are properly equalized there
should be at least $1,500,000 worth
of property on the rolls, or one-half
more than at present is accounted
for."
The speaker then proceeded to,
give a number of specific instances.
where certain assessments were en
tirely too high, and ,others so ri
diculously low that there was no ac
counting for the fact.
After further discussion along the
same lines by Mr. Robt. L. Aubert
the council passed a motion appoint
ing a committee to report back at a
special meeting on next Tuesday for
the purpose of looking into a reform
of the assessmebts ind devising ways

April 20th as Tick
Eradication Day.
SCHOOLS OF ST. TAM
MANY TO O13SE)VE IT
Pupils Will Be Taught How
Pest May Be Destroyed
and Cost of Pest to
Farms of State.
lu response to tthe GoUu r'Jr'
proclamation, the 20th day of Aprii
has been set aside in the, public
schools as "Tick Eradication Day."
The great importance of ridding tl1e
State of the cattle tick has pop)ular
ized this movement for educating,
the people as to the cost of this pest
and the means ot destroying it.
The following list of questions and
answers have been preparel for dis
tribution in the schools:
Teacher-
Kill the Cattle Tick! Why:
Pupils answer-
1. Because the Cattle rick car
ries and-transmits the germ uof Tex
as Fever and prevents us from get
tilg good animals from the tick-free
sections to improve our cattle.
2. Because Cattle Ticks ,ill our
own native cattle in the winter when
feed becomes scarce.
3. Because Cattle Ticks re luce
the quantity and quality of our mi'lk
supply.
4. Because Cattle Ticks cause
quarantine of our beef cattle fron'
the most 'proftable markets.
5. Because Tick Eradication
means an open market for our cattle
at any and all seasons of the year
without restrictions.
6. Because Cattle Ticks prevent
our farmers from competing witi
Northern farmers in the best cattle
markets.
7. Because cattle that are tick
free make much larger gains, on the
same feed, than those that are tick
infested. r
8. iBecause Cattle Ticks hinder
diversified farming, which is so much
needed to develop our agricultural
Sresources.l
9. Because Cattle Ticks keep
many desirable immigrant farmers
and stockmen away from Louisiana.
10. Because Tick Eradication
would greatly increase the value of
our farm lands.
11. Because Tick Eradication
wduld increase the value of our
cattle from $5 to $10 per head in the
markets; and enable us to import
betteP cattle to add to the values:
When the Cattle Tick goes out, the
Dollar comes in.
12. Because all of the other
Southern States are killing the Cat
tle Tick, and Louisiana cannot af
ford to lag behind and lose the bene
fits of Tick Eradication.
Teacher
Kill the Cattle Tick! How?
Pupils answer
By the regulasr use of the Dipping
Vat and the Standard Arsenical So
lution, and everybody helping.
and means of providing for the
school furniture fund which had
been discussed.
A Generous Act.
Dr. F. F. Young, Sr., is well
known in Covington, and his New
Fenwick Sanitarium is known as a
retreat where those cursed with the
drug and liquor habit are put in a
normal condition and given another
chance in the battles of life. We see
these patients come hire in the last
stages of despondency and hopeless
ness, and we see them go away
cheerful and contented. These
things we take as a matter of course,
and say, "the Doctor must be mak
ing money."
But there are some, thing we do
act see and do not know. Th, many
t.ti.ea the ban' is rsecl.edl owr to pull
back some unfortunate from the pit
of despair, merely in pity for the
misfortunes ofr humanity and with
out reward, are incidents in private
life and are hidden in the gratitude
of those who have been benefitted.
An incident in mind is the trial of
Robert Burgess, at Beaumont, Texas.
for the shooting and killing of his
wife in August, 1915, and sentenced
to hang on the 29th of this month,
a new trial having been refused.
Dr. Young is known as an expert in

The manager of Parkview Theatre

made that it was annoying to others.

The management also requests
that children with whooping-cough

audience should be sufficient to cause
parents to heed this request.
The management has alarge4.the.
