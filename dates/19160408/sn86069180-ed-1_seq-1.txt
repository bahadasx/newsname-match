THE CHURCH
Shown to Be a Friend of Educa
tion For the Masses by Icon
oclast Editor.
Catholics Pay Annually Over
Forty Million Dollars For ,
Parochial Schools.
The Records and Achievements
of Catholic Scholars and
Scientists.
HAVE FURNISHED NO TRAITORS
The A. P. A. orators and organs
and somo of our Protestant relig
ious journals like tho local Baptist
organs persistently state that the
Catholic church and its clergy are
opposed to education, repeating this
so often that many havo taken up
the cry without question. C. A.
"Windle, tho non-Catholic editor of
Brann's Iconoclast, replies to this
class in tho following article,, en
titled "Is Catholicism An Enemy of
Education?"
A. P. A. orators and editors spend
most of their time and energies
trying to prove that tho Catholic
church is opposed to education for
the masses. This absurd fallacy
finds its base in an erroneous un
derstanding of tho Catholic attitude
toward the public school system.
The church does not object to this
system because it is opposed to
popular education, but it believes
that the child should havo a re
ligious education, which tho public
school can not give. As proof of
their sincerity Catholics pay their
taxes to the State for tho purpose
of supporting public schools in
which Protestant children are edu
cated, and levy a special school tax
against themselves in order to glvo
their own children what they con
sider proper religious training.
Criticism of our public school sys
tem, or any other American insti
tution, Is not incompatible with
patriotism. Freedom of speech and
press gives all citizens tho right to
express their candid opinion on such
matters. Criticism is not to be
feared. It tendB to correct defects
and ImDrovo'tho standard of exccll-
r. mA Tninftitnl anhnnla nnxt Amirl-

and it would cost many additional
millions to provide buildings for the
pupils now attending religious
schools. Instead of condemning
Catholics, Protestants should feel a
sense of gratitude for this relief
from higher taxes.
If their enemies could show that
parochial schools do not educate, do
not prepare tho future citizen for
his station in life, their protest
would not be unreasonable. But In
view of the fact that pupils of both
systems must meet each other in
competition for honors in every
field of endeavor reveals the utter
absurdity of the A. P. A. conten
tion. Each system needs tho
other.' Competition is good for
both, and tends to raise the stand
ard of education and make public
and parochial schools far better
than either would be without tho
other. No Catholic would handicap
his child by giving it an inferior
education, and neither would a
Protestant.
Tho State is forbidden to estab
lish any church or Interfere with
tho religious rights of tho Indi
vidual. Tho constitution bars relig
ious instruction in public sdhools.
Both public and parochial schools
fall far short of perfection, but
their graduates never find tho in-'
structlon thoy receive a handicap in
tho battle of life. Fighting side by
side they attain tho highest honors
in theology, politics, literature,
commerce, art and science. John D.
Rockefeller Is a product of one sys
tem and Thomas F. Ryan is a
graduate of tho other. Justice
Hughes, of tho United States Su
premo Court, received his prelim
inary education in public schools,
whiln fihtof Justice "White co't his
start in tho narochlal school. A
Catholic education did not prevent
Joseph Tumulty from becoming
private secretary to tho President
or the united states, nor am it pre
vent Dr. John B. Murphy, of Chi
cago, from becoming tho greatest
surgeon of our time.
Tho Universities of Paris,
Salerno, Oxford and Cambrldgo
rere founded by the Catholic
church in the thirteenth century.
In the fourteenth century she es
tablished the Universities of Romo,
Dublin, Cologne, Heldelburg and
others. In all the centuries of tho
Christian era her priests have been
recognized as tho best educated
mon of their day. Today her schol
ars, her scientists, divide honors
with tho greatest men of tho world.
Among those wo And tho names of
Pasteur, Madam Currlo and Mar
coni. Among the master painters
of the world sho placed the name of
Raphael, Murillo, Rembrandt,
Rubens and Da Vinci. Among her
immortal poets we find the names
of Dante, Dryden, Pope and Shakes
pere. It was of Shakespere that
Ingersoll said:
"Tho lm a pin at Inn had a. state in
Shakespere's brain, whereon were
set all tho scenes that He between
the morn of laughter and the night
of tears, and where his players
bodied forth the false and true, the
Joys and griefs, the careless shad'
owe and the tragic deeps of life.
From Shakespere's brain there
poured a Niagara of gems, spanned
by Fancy's seven-hued arch. As
a drop of dew contains the image
of the earth and sky, so all there
i of life was' mirrored forth in
Shakespere's brain."
America owes much to Catholic
explorers the torch-bearers of
civilization. Without their names
and record of gallant deeds the
story of this republic could not bo
told. Horo they are: Columbus,
Do Soto, Jollct, Marquette and Do
La Salle. A Catholic education did
not make Lord Baltimore an enemy
of freedom. Ho made Maryland n
refuge for tho oppressed. Within
that Commonwealth religious lib
erty found its first home in all tho
world.
A Catholic education did not keep
Charles Carroll, of Carrollton, from
addinc his name to tho American
Declaration of Independence, nor
prevent Gen. Phil Sheridan from be
coming one of the greatest soldiers
of the republic. Catholic education
never made a traitor to the Stars
and Stripes. Tills fact Is sealed by
the blood of Catholics shed upon
overy battlefield of the republic
from Lexington to Manilla Bay.
Guardians of Bigotry who seek to
provo that the Catholic church is
an enemy of education must invent
their evidence. It does not exist In
any authentic record. I challenge
Tom Watson, Teddy Walker and
the entire array of A. P. A. orators
and editors to name one
demonstrable fact. In philosophy,
economics, astronomy, medlclno, or
any branch of science which the
Catholic church refuses to accept
at its face value. Among tho
fallacies of A. P. Aism there is
nothing more false, or more utterly
absurd than the delusion that tho
Catholic church is tho enemy of
popular education.

HOLY WEEK
Impressive Ceremonies That
Precede Bright and Glorious
Easter.
Begin "With Procession Com
memorating Christ's Entry
Into Jerusalem.
The Blessing of the Paschal
Candle Telling That Christ
Has Risen.
THE TENEBRAE AND ITS MEANING
Whether the world be ten thou
sand years' old or ten million years
old, there havo been only two really
great weeks in its history one
when God created the universe, and
each day was marked by somo
miracle of power; the other when
God repaired his work, created it
In a manner again, purified it,
brought It back to its early sanctity
by tho blood and death of his Son.
Tho church la the spouse of Christ
and loves to dwell with eager af
fection on every scene sanctified by
his presence on this earth. Hcnco
sho conducts tho faithful through
all tho mysteries wrought to accom
plish our salvation. The ceremon
ies of Holy Week begin with Palm
Sunday's procession commemorating
our Lord s triumphant entry into
Jerusalem.
Tho name "Tenebrae," meaning
darkness, is given to the evening
services of Wednesday, Thursday
and Friday of Holy Week from tho
circumstance of extinguishing, dur
ing tho course of tho ceremonies, all
lights In tho sanctuary. Every
mark of joy or festivity is removed
to indicate that tho house of God
is a house of mourning during these
days on account of tho sufferings
and death of our Holy Redeemer
and on account of our own sins
and the sins of all mankind. The
Psalms and lessons that aro read
or chanted in these offices are ex
pressive of our sighs and lamenta
tions and aro terminated each day
with the same prayer imploring God
to look with an eye of pity on those
for whom his only Son our Saviour
suffered and died. Tho six dark
wax candles on tho altar and the
fifteen placed on ,the leptstle side 'of
UteMBe4arylftl!mrigtwAtiM!'
beElnnlng of the office, aro sig
nificant or the faith preached by the
ancient prophets and by Christ Him
self. The triangular shape of this
stand of fifteen candles represents
tho fundamental article of our faith,
the mystery of tho Blessed Trinity.
After each of the fourteen antiphons
In the matins and lauds of tho of
fice ono of the candles In the
triangular stand is extinguished and
during tho chanting of the last six
verses of the Psalm Benedictus tne
candles on tho altar are put out,
recalllnc that the Jews were totally
deprived of the light of faith when
they put Jesus to deatn. Tne tit
teenth candlo is left burning, but
Is taken from its position, hidden
for a time, and again brought forth
still burning, to signify that al
though Christ, tho Light of the
World, died as man and was laid
In the sepulchre, yet Ho never
ceased to live as God and his human
body roso again to life. Tho total
darkness (tenebrao) in tho sanc
tuary, during tho Mlsororo and the
prayer, reminds us of the darkness
that spread over tho earth at our
Saviour's death. Tho nolso mado
at tho end of tho prayer, beforo the
lighted candlo Is brought back, rep
resents tho general confusion as tho
earth trembled, tho rocks wero split,
tho graves opened and the veil of
the templo was rent when tho sacri
fice of Calvary was consummated.
On Holy Thursday aro commem
orated our Lord's Last Supper with
hiB apostles and tho institution of
tho Blessed Sacrament of the Euch
arist. It Is sometimes called
"Maundy Thursday" from the word
"Mandatum" in the ceremony pi
tho washing of tho foet, which took
placo on the samo night. The mass
of this day dlffors from tho rest of
tho office, and tho notes of joy and
thanksgiving for this holy Bacra
ment of the Eucharist appear in tho
whito vestments and ornaments of
tho altar and in tho ringing of bolls,
which is not to bo hoard again
until Easter Saturday. Two largo
hosts aro consecrated in this mass,
one for the sacrifice of the day, tho
other to be carried in solemn pro
cession to a richly adorned "repos
itory." where It is kept until tho
next day and thon consumed in
what is called the mass of the pro
sanctified. After tho mass tho tabernacle on
the main altar is deserted, its door
thrown open, and tho altars aro
stripped of all covering and decora
tion. Tho purpose of this is to.be
ablo to continue the office of the
Tenebrae in tho evening in befitting
gloom and without the pomp and
light that should surround the
sacred host on this commemoration
of the institution of tho Blessed
Eucharist.
No mass is offered on Good Fri
day, but the priest consumes the
sacred host which was consecrated
the day before and reserved In the
repository. This is often called the
mass or the presanctlfled. The
chief feature of the ceremonies of
this day is the uncovering and
adoration of the crucifix. Solemn
prayers are offered for all classes
of persons, including schismatics,
heretics, Jews and pagans. After
the solemn adoration of the cross
the candles on the altar are lighted
and the sacred ministers go in pro
cession to the repository and bring
back the sacred host for the com
pletion of the function. At the
cUwe of the Berries an opportunity
Is given to all the peoplo to kiss the
crucifix.
The morning office on Holy I
Saturday Begins at, j;30 with the
blessing of, the new' fire. At tho
church door cbals rare lighted and
the officiating Jfpriest with his at
tendants blesses them,1 sprinkling
them with holy water. Next comes
tho blessing of;tho grains of incenso
which are to be imbedded later in
the paschal candle. Then follows
tho lighting of' tho triple candle,
which Rvmlinlfitwr filnlst thn T.leht
!of the World and signifies that our
faith in tho Blessed Trinity pro
ceeds from tnej light communicated
to us by our rJseniSaviour.
The paschal, candle is thon
blessed by thec deacon. It is not
lighted at firaf to represent Christ
still dead, and. the grains of incense
aro imbedded m tho candle to re
call the embalnjlng in the sepulchre
with aromatic laplces; then comes
the lighting oly the. candlo, telling
us that Ho has risen. The sane
tuary lamp is
rthen lightod. The
blessing of tho
baptismal font also
takes place di ring the morning's
office and East r holy water is pre
pared for dist ibution among the
peoplo. Then follows tho solemn
chanting of tho Jiltany of the Saints,
the sacred ministers are vested In
the joyful white vestments for tho
celebration of mass, the candles on
the altar are lighted, and other
harbingers of- the Resurrection ap
pear even In the floral decorations
of tho altar. rThe service closes
with the short Mleluia vespers and
the anthem 'R sgipa' Coell, laetare,
alleluia."
INDORSE KLING.
-J- 2L.: -,.?
At a meeting l'b'fV tho German
American Alliamce "''this past week
resolutions were adopted indorsing
Ben W. Kling as a candidate for the
Board of Education, tho election for
which takes plage ,next November. It
will be remembered that Mr. Kling
made tho race for tho same office
two years ago and, despite tho
handicap of fighting unaided tho
different clubs and organizations
which dictate nominations for the
board, made a splendid raco and
came within an aco of winning. As
one of his enthusiastic supporters ex
pressed It, "Wo have allowed a
select few, who dictate tho policies
of somo of our local organizations,
to chooso tho board members every
year, and it wouldn't bea bad idea
to allow tho people a chance to
select ono or two this year."

tho "Deliverers" of the
Labor Vote.
Gov. Stanley and Commissioner
Matt Cohen-Disregard Their
Selections.
Hutchcraft Bill Still a Bone of
Contention in State
Politics.
SHERLEY WITHOUT OPPOSITION
Prior to the November election
tho Kentucky Irish American pre
dicted a close finls'h in the Stanley
Morrow race for Governor, stating
that Morrow and the Republican
State nominees were gaining ground
dally, and tho cause for this was at
tributed to tho mismanagement oi
the Democratic campaign by tho
State Committee. It was charged
in these columns that thoso in
charge wero frittering away valua
ble time and campaign tunas oy
bargaining for tho labor voto with
a tew so-caneu laDor icauers, wno
were so condescendingly sending out
thousands of indorsements of Stan
ley and tho Democratic ticket, car
loads of this class of literature be
ing sent into tho sections whero
union minors predominate. Tho i
dorseraent would probably consist of
largo photographs of Stanley, Gom-
pors and one of tlio deliverers or
the labor vote, the latter telling
workmen that ho was putting his
o. K. or approval on tne siaio
Democratic ticket. Tho result was
as could bo expected. Thousands of
union and other workingmen. re
buked tho walking delegates by vot
ing against the Democratic ticket.
That tho contentions in these col
umns wero amply proven it is only
necessary to call attention to tho
fact that realizing they had been
Btung and imposed upon. Matt
Cohen, the Labor Commissioner,
flatly turned down tne choico or tno
labor voto deliverers for the position
of State Labor Inspector, while Gov.
Stanley follows his lead by giving
them a cold throw-down in appoint
ing members of tho Workmen's
Compensation Board. f

syliree1e1ePtslfshewi)r
tho following article taken irom an
Eastern magazine and contenamg
that the labor vote can not bo de
livered: "Proof of this Is found In
tho result of reecnt elections. Sen
ator Penrose, of Pennsylvania, op
posed by the labor leaders, had a
plurality of 150,000 votes, while
Gov. Glynn, of New York, who was
promised tho labor vote, was de
feated by the same figure. Lieut.
Gov. Barry, of Massachusetts, with
the walking delegates' Indorsement,
was defeated, while Lieut. Gov.
Harding, of Ohio, who had their"
bitter enmity, was elected. Thomas
Van Lear in Minnesota, Clyde Kelly
In Pennsylvania, and Prof. Irving
Fisher In Pennsylvania, all candi
dates for Congress, and having tho
Indorsement of the political labor
leaders, woro defeated. All of which
goes to provo that tho self-styled
labor leaders who trade with poli
ticians for the labor voto and soek
fat offices as part of tho trade can
not deliver what thoy promise." Tho
Now York Times says: "Labor is
always being fooled through its
leaders." This is an error, it is
tho politicians who aro "always bo
ing fooled." Some day our soft
headed politicians will realize tills
Important fact. All of tho above is
but a repetition or what nas Deen
told in these columns, and no
ono realizes tho truth of it now
more than Gov. Stanley and tho
other State officials.
This office Is in receipt of copies
of both tho famous Hutchcraft and
Green bills, tho sender noting on
tho margin "you aro evidently not
familiar with these 'bills," seeking
to imply probably tho stereotyped
argument of the Hutchcraft suppqrt
era that tho Green bill was tho
worst of tho two and tho Hutch
craft measure was a compromise
substitute. For tho benefit of Iho
sender tho position taken in these
columns and which is voiced by
members of both Houses is that tho
Administration could havo beaten
BOTH bills and that there never
was a timo aunng tno recent ses
sion that the administration leaders
were in danger of losing that con
trol. Tho Hutchcraft measure is a
spito law, pure and stmplo, and can
be construed to suit certain con
veniences. In tho Polico Court last
week one saloonkeeper was ac
quitted because ho probably didn't
understand tho law, while Thursday
another was held over to tho grand
Jury because his curtains weren't at
a certain anglo, although no proof
waB Introduced or oven hinted at
that he violated tho law by selling
liquor on Sunday.
Disregarding tho merits or demer
its of Councilman M. J. McDcrmott's
measure introduced Tuesday even
ing concerning the employment of
residents of Indiana in Louisville,
tho fact remains that it was an un
fair attack of the Courier-Journal
on the Councilman, the article reek
ing with personalities, and one of
the crimes charged against him was
that he was a "moulder." While
discussing his political history the
writer failed to state that Mr. Mc
Dermott received the highest vote
of twonty-four Councllmen in the
last election, which is pretty good
proof of his standing in tho com
munity. Incidentally in the same
election the Courier-Journal favor
ites as usual trailed in the rear.
It Is conceded that Congressman
Swagar Sherley will be nominated
in the primary without opnoaiuon
but may havo a littlo rough sailing
in tho November election, as tho
Presidential year has always been a
handicap to our Congressman. In
the off years he Is given recori
majorities, but in tho Presidential
contests ho travels under, a handi
cap. Four years ago, with Wilson
running, ho only won by a small
majority from an unknown, while
two years ago he received a major
ity over tho Bull Moose and Repub
lican nominees combined. Repre
sentative "Doc" Ryans is about the
strongest of the Republican possi
bilities mentioned, but it is rumored
that Chesley Searcy, the local con
troller of , tho G. O. P.'s destinies,
favors Joseph Lawton for the nomination.

PREMIER SEES POPE.
Premier Asqulth, of Great Brit
ain, was received In a private audi
ence by Popo Benedict last Satur
day, duo chiefly to tho influence and
activity of ono of tho greatest Car
dinals England has ever had. Car
dinal Oasquet, who recalls tho tinjo
when Britishers wero represented
in the Senate of tho Papacy by such
names as Howard, Manning, New
man and Vaughan. When Premier
Asqulth called on tho Pope ho was
accompanied by the Britisher Min
ister to tho Holy See. Newspapers
expressed the opinion that Pope
Benedict desired to tako advantage
of Mr. Asquith'a prosenco in Rome
to mako another effort in favor of
peaco, by insisting on his previously
stated contention that an expressed
willingness on tho part of tho
belligerents to mako reciprocal con
cessions might lead to tho opening
of negotiations and tho ending of
the great conflict.
It was also assorted that tho
Popo was anxious to sot forth his
claim to participation in tho re
spective peaco conferenco to bo held
at tho conclusion df hostilities, the
basts of which claim is that ho is
the spiritual head ot millions of
thoso engaged on both sides in the
war.

City Authorities Follshly Allow
Him Use of the City
Hall.
GUARDED IN POLICE STATION
Following the example of Slattery,
who was mobbed in Chicago recently
for his vilo and filthy lectures
against tho Catholic church and
clergy, a .fake ex-priest, known aB
Dr. Thomas E. Leyden, has been
traveling through Massachusetts
denouncing the parochial schools and
nun teachers, causing riotous demon
strations wherever ho appears. It
has been proven that Leyden was
never a priest, but strango to say
some ministers of tho gospel havo
espoused his cause and aro busy pro
moting hl3 bigoted lectures. The
following taken from a Boston paper
shows tho troublo ho sows wherever
appearing:
After his scheduled lecturo as
sailing parochial schools had been
broken up by the heckling of a crowd
that filled tho City Hall this after
noon, Dr. Thomas E. Leyden, of
Somervllle, who advertises himself
as "a converted Catholic priest,"
was forced to tako refuge in tho
polico station and thore await dark
ness and tho dispersing of a mob
of several thousand before making
a dash in an nutomobilo to a local
hotel. Despite tho Incidents of to
day, however, it has been advertised
that the City Hall has been re-engaged
for tomorrow and Dr. Leyden
says ho will speak both during the
afternoon and evening.
When' Dr. Herbert E. Wales, a
local dentist, and Chairman of the
meeting, this afternoon ascended tho
platform a capacity audlenco jammed
the hall, while scattered through
the room were , fifteen policemen
under Deputy . MaFetolLlHraniW. ;
CharlPM?HonT?aiitriarrcr
Hill. Rev. J. Franklin B'abb, pastor
of the Union Congregational church,
opened tho meeting with a prayor,
and after an Introduction by Dr.
Wales, Dr. Leyden started to speak.
Hardly had he opened his mouth
when ho was interrupted by thun
derous applause, which continued
every time ho sought to got In a
word. Finally ho called upon the
police for aid, but was told nothing
could bo dono as long as tho audl
enco did nothing but applaud. Sev
eral Chlneso bombs wero exploded
during this interruption, and ono
youth, Edward Kerrigan, was ar
rested. When Dr. Leyden again
started to speak an epidemic of
coughing swept through tho audi
ence, and Dr. Wales then attempted
to restore order but failed.
While Dr. Wales was holding an
argumont with tho polico Dr. Ley
den, carrying his overcoat and bag,
sneaked down a back stairway to
the polico station, whero ho asked
to bo locked up in tho guardroom..
Whon his escape was discovered the
crowd In the hall went out Into tho
street and there joined 1,000 more
gathered outside. The mon pro
ceeded to tho polico station and
gathered outsido, while two young
men, purporting to bo reporters,
went insido with tbo purposo of dis
covering whethor Dr. Leyden was
still there. They engaged him in
conversation, and ho began, it is
alleged, a- tirade against tho Cath
olic religion. Soveral of tho police
officers present objected to the dis
cussion and City Marshal Mack, who
was present, ejectod tho fakp re
porters and forbade any further re
ligious discussions.
During this time Dr. Leyden made
soveral attempts to escape in cabs
called for thd purposo, but each time
the crowd became so threatening
that ho was forced to abandon the
attempt. Not only woro Main, Court
and Winter streets Jammed with
people, but another crowd of about
400 had congregated at tho Boston
and Malno depot. Finally with the
approach of darkness the crowd dis
persed somewhat, and whon an
automobile stopped outsido Dr.
Leyden rushed into it and escaped
without being molested. Ho went to
a local hotel and registered there for
tho night.
Leyden, who now styles himself
"Dr. Leyden" and "Rev. Thomas
Leyden," years ago lived in
Brooklyn, where ho worked at the
printers' trado, arid after the death
of his wife went to Boston, where
ho married a young woman of the
Baptist faith, then turning evan
gelist. Onco during his career he
returned to Brooklyn and in at
tempting .Jo lecturo before his for
mer associates in tho printing trades
was rotten egged and driven out of
town. His lectures aro entitled
"Why I left tho Popo's Church."
"Secrets of tho Confession, for' Men
Only," etc.
