You do just four things and no
more. You think; you remember;
you imagine; you act. When you
learn to think better, remember
better, imagine better or act better
you are increasing your efficiency,
and, therefore your income. You
may feel you are very successful
now. Suppose you are; it isn't a
question of what you know, but of
how beneficial a practical business
education will be to you in addi
tion to what you already know.

Insomnia
Indigestion nearly always disturbs
the sleep more or less, and is often
the cause of insomnia. Eat a light
-sipper with litt!e if any meat, and no
milk; also take one cf Cbamberlain's
Tablets immediately after supper, aud

with us that to violate a part of
the laws of business means partial
failure, and to violate all the laws
means complete failure. You are
also aware that to observe part of
the laws of business means partial
success, and to observe all of the
laws of business complete success.
Our aim is to help you observe a
higher per cent of the laws of suc
cess, and, therefore, enable you to1
be nearer the maxium success.
The late Prof. James, of Harvard
declares that the average man only
uses ten per cent of his brain pow
er. Suppose you are twice as capa
ble as the average man? Even
that would mean you are only
using twenty per cent of your
maximum possibilities. The pur
pose of our course is to produce a
maximum of proficiency with a
minimum effort. The business
world wants thinkers and doers.
There's a famine of high priced
men today; there are thousands of
men worth a thousand dollars a
year, but only a few worth ten
thousand a year. Be the latter
kind of a man; you can if you will.
We know that a man is worth only
about $2.O0 a dty from the chin
down, selling muscle, but as high
as a hundred thousand dollars a

Don't forget to Plant Peas in
All of the Corn.
BY T. H. CASANOVA
Corn planting is well advanced
in the parish and a great many
acres of land are being planted
again with the same crop corn.
There is no doubt in my mind, but
that this land will make a much
poorer crop than last year, as the
greater per cent of farmers do not
even try to keep the land fertile
by planting peas in the corn. This
land unfit for corn as it is would
probably make better returns in a
pea crop and besides give the bene
fit of the nitrogen stored by the
pea plant in the soil. There is no
permlanent system of agriculture
balsd on corn alone to be harvest
ed for grain. There must be some
crop to return the plant food ele
IeInts taken by the corn crop.
There are farms in the parish
that a few years ago would hardly
grow a crop of weedt. 'Vorn and
.xhaulllted by a one crop system..
oav that land is producing TaV
i:g crops of core but it was brou' t
to his -t.ateof fertility by the pla:i -
ing of peas. Peas will make your
farm ri h anI bring large harvests
and you can put money in 11:e
hank: the absence of peas will de.
plete your land, reduce your yields
and fin:dll cause you to lose your
farm. X!,w is the time to get
ready for the planting of peas in
the corn and on every availlable
acres. It will pay you and you
can save the seed for next year to
sell to the other fellow. Ph-,t peas.

Agricultural News Items

The club boys of Erath school
have just gotten in a nice bunch of
pigs. They are being helped by
the Bank of Erath.
Quite a number of farmers and
business men from the parish went
over to the meeting at the U. S.
Stock farm at Hope this week.
About 15000 head of stock have
been vaccinated for charbon this
month.
Some of the farmers have gotten
together and are getting a car load
of lime stone for their lands.
The season for corn planting is
well on and most of the club boys
are planting corn.
