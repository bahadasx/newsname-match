WASHINGTON, Apr. 8. The original order Riven General KuiiHton, was
made public for Hie first time today, but did not include by direction the
death or capture of Villa, but principally directed the disposal or Villa's out
law bandits that attacked Columbus.
The troops will be withdrawn aH soon hk the defacto government of
Mexico in able to relieve them of this work. In any event the work of these
troops will be regarded as finished as soon as Villa's band or bandits Is
known to be broken up.
General Scolt, chief of staff; said General Funstou had not yit reported
that his task hud been accomplished. He would express no opinion whether
he believed the orders had been completely carried out.

EL PASO, Apr. 8. When the Americans have accomplished their object
of destroying Villa's military power, they should withdraw without delay.
This view was expressed by high Cnnanza officials, who said: "The presence
of Americans Is beginning to irritate the Mexicnns. it looks like a surrender
of sovereignly. With Villa crushed, It Is now the logical time for the punitive
force to withdraw. So far Hie affair has turned out'fortunately for both sides."

ELKO COUNTY MAY
LICENSE GAMBLING
At their meeting this afternoon, the
county commissioners are considering;
the question of lacensing all games In
Elko and Carlin, says the Elko inde
pendent. District Attorney Carvllle lias given
the opinion tliat ordinances might be
adopted which would provide for the
licensing of games in towns having a
town government, and as the attorney
general, who is expected tomorrow,
concurs in this opinion, there is little
doubt that such ordinances will be
passed.
The recent grand Jury called atten
tion to the fact that the gaming laws
are being violated daily, and the slier
iff was directed to take steps to en
force the law. In the opinion of the
board the matter inn best be regu
lated by providing for a high license
for all games. Furthermore, a con
siderable amount of revenue for town
purposes could in this way be se
cured. Wf. believe that such action by the
bon.rd would meet with popular favor.

IN WRATH OVER

THE HAGUE, Netherlands, Apr. 8.
-7-The latest development in pro-Flemish
schemes of the Germans in Bel
gium is a long letter from Baron von
Hissing, the German governor general,
refusing to renounce his plan of con
verting the University of Ghent into
a Flemish University, although re
quested to do so by a group of well
known leaders of the Flemish move
ment themselves.
A number of leading Flemings of
Antwerp, realizing how their cause
might be set back after the war by
the present interveutioin of the Ger
mans in Its favor, recently petitioined
the governor general to leave the so
lution of this question to the Belgians
themselves, putting forward various
reasons of a political and moral na
ture why lie should give up the scheme
regarding Ghent University. . "
The petition was viewed with dis
appointment and displeasure by the
governor general whose reply declar
ed that preparations for systematical
ly carrying out the reform of Client
University have already begun, and
that "the objections raised are not of
such a nature as to give ground for
my going back 011 my decision."
"1 attach," he continues, "too much
value to the material and moral task
of higher education and the universi
ties to share In your opinion that the
benefits of such education be with
held for a long period yet from the ris
ing generation of the occupied coun
try without inflicting great harm up
on It."

PROPOSED GRANGES
"There is no single reason for you
to speak of my resolve as a superflu
ous gift that the Flemings might not
accept at German hands. Likewise,
your opinion that the question of the
Ghent University is one of purely in
ternal Belgian policy, in which the
occupying power is not competent to j
fegally justifiable. You know very
well that in peace time, in contrast
to the French, Germany has always
avoided mixing itself up in these mat
ters. So much the less can I allow
that the governing and administrative
rights which Germany, as occupying
power, now has in Belgium, with re
gard also to higher education, be res
tricted In any way.
Dutch and Belgian authorities on
international law dispute the consti
tutional right of the Germans to In
tervenein the internal affairs of a
temporal ily occupied country, as op
posed to the spirit and letter of the
Hague convention of 1907 relating to
the laws and usages of land vs;Ia:'.
As a matter of fact, however, most
Belgians are quite indisposed to make
themselves seriously anxious about
the execution of Baron von Hissing's
plan. It is in one sense an easy mat
ter to open a Flemish University, but
a university must have professors and
students, and that is just where the
rub comes. Nevertheless, continued
efforts are being made both in Bel
gium and Holland to get together the
necessary forces for organizing the
riemlsh university.

(By Associated Press.)
LONDON, Apr. 8. The Balient in the French lines west of the Mouse,
near the Village of Bethincourt at Its sharpest angle, is being pounded on
both sides by the Crown Prince's troops.
Success was achieved near Haucourt, lost by the French last Wednesday,
the Germans gaining a footing in too Bmall field works between Haucourt and
Hill 287. .
On the other side of the salient there also has been sharp fighting, but,
according to Paris the advantage is with the French who bested the adver
saries in grenade combats between Bethincourt and Chattancourt.
Paris does not accept the German statement that the French forces are
in jeopardy through having their retreat reduced to a narrow isthmus and con
fidence in the eventual outcome of the struggle continues unabated.
No commanding position has been lost and the fighting is nothing more
than the general give and take observed in former reports.
OCEAN
FREIGHTS
RISING RAPIDLY
COST OF TRANS ATLANTIC CAR
RIAGE HAS ADVANCED 900
PER CENT
( By AmmwIhIfiI I'rrnM.)
WASHINGTON, D. C, Apr. 8. Dr.
E. E. Pratt, chief of the bureau of
foreign and domestic commerce, calls
attention to the rapid rise in ocean
freight rates from American ports. A
special point is made of the remark
able rise in the rates on grain, out of
the principal American exports. This
Increase from New York to Liverpool
in the last two years has been about
900 per cent, while tne increase in the
rate on flour has been S00 per cent
and the increase on provisions only
400 per cent. The more rapid increase
on grain is accounted for by the fact
that in ordinary times grain is carried
at especially low rates because of
its desirability as ballast and because
it can easily be taken on and dis
charged.
The shortage of ships that has led
to the remarkable increases in ship
ping rates is attributed to the follow
ing causes in the latter to the com
mlttee: (1) The elimination of (he
merchant ships of t.tirmany and Aus
tria-Hungary; (2) the withdrawal of
merchant ships for military and naval
purposes; and (3) the loss of ships
through submarine and mining opera
tions. ADMITS HOLDING UP POSTAL

LARGEST ATTENDANCE EVER
SEEN IN TONOPAH AT A
PRIVATE FUNERAL
The obsequies over the remains of
the late Cal Shaw drew one of the
largest gatherings observed at the
funeral of a private citizen in this
camp. The ceremonies were held in
the hall of the Elk which was pack
ed to capacity with an audience rep
resenting every class and embracing
a large percentage of mine managers
and operators who regarded the de
ceased as one of their best friends.
The outpouring was marked by floral
contributions that were limited only
by the supply of available offerings.
The exercises conformed to the
ritual of the order with its beautiful
sentiment picturing the sterling
qualities and worthy character of the
brother who bad gone to his last ac
count. Rev. It. W. Bayless, pastor of
the Presbyterian church assisted in
the services at the conclusion of which
the body was escorted to the local
cemetery by a cortege that taxed the
motoring facilities of the district. It
is estimated that over 400 people were
air the indoor services while at least
one half that numoer followed the
body to the grave.
The list of magnificent floral offer
ings were printed in the Bonanza yes
terday but words failed to describe the
grand effect of the testimonials bank
ed high around the coffin. The piece
from Ouray lodge, Colorado, of which
Mr. Shaw was a life member was one
of the most striking pieces seen in
Tonopah.
The pallbearers were: Charles En
