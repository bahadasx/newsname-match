WASHINGTON, April 7. -Aclminis-tiatiun
leaders in congress are hopeful
that tlic army increase hill, first of the
three great national defense measures,
vv ill enter its final stage next week be
foie the joint conference committee.
Indications tonight were that the only
remaining section likely to cause pro
longed dehate in the senate was the one
fixing the peace strength of the remilar
army.
The senate voted on only one amend
ment to the hill today, adopting with
out roll call the proposal of Senator
Smith of Georgia that enlisted men in
the regular army hereafter lie given
opportunity for 7.7 hours of vocational
education a month during their active
service in peace times. Civilian in
structors to aid the army officers in
this work ate authorized hy the amend
ment, which specifies thai the training
shall he in agriculture or the mechan
ical arts. Senator Chamberlain ac
cepted the amendment when Senator
Smith reduced the time allotted from
'Ji to "5 hours a month.
Debate on various proposals for the
erection of a government plant for the
fixation of atmospheric nitrogen occu
pied the remainder of the day. The
pending amendment was that of Sen
ator Smith of South Carolina to ap
propriate $15,000,000 for a plant, site
and process to he determined hy the
war department. The surplus capacity
over the government's needs in peace
times, under the proposal would go into
the manufacture of fertilizer to be sold
by the government through the secre
tary of agriculture.
Senator Hardwick of Georgia at
tacked this phase of the amendment as
socialistic, lie declared himself unal
terably opposed to embarking the gov
ernment on any such venture and
Mitestioned its constitutionality. Sen
ator Smith said he had framed the
amendment with the purpose of reduc
ing the cost of fertilizer to the farmer
because, by a happy circumstance, the
government's military needs and those
of the farmer coutd be met at the
same time. He insisted that the dis
posal by the government of its surplus
capacity by lease or otherwise was .jus
tified under the constitution.
Senator Lodge also attacked the
project, but addressed himself particu
larly to the amendment offered by Sen
ator I'nderwood of Alabama, which
would provide for a war department
investigation of the question of wat-er-povver
site and the process to lie used,

the connections of F. S. Washburn and
.). W. Worthington. who appeared be
fore the house military committee to
favor a plan for government co-operation
in a nitrogen plant, with various
.southern power and fertilizer compa
nies. The Massachusetts senator said
these companies were all interlocking,
the Alabama I'ower company, one of
those mentioned, controlling the major
ity of them, and that they undoubtedly
would profit by the acceptance of the
.Muscle Shoals (Alabama) project.
Senator I'nderwood denied this, as
serting that the Alabama I'ower com
pany was opposed to the plan. Ilis
amendment, he added, favored no spe
cific project, but only sought a full in
vestigation of the subject.
"There is not a senator here," said
Senator I'nderwood. "who does not
realize the deplorable condition this
country would be in because of its
shortage of nitrates for explosives if
war should be declared against us. A
second rate power could make us sur
render in six months if we had no sur
plus of nitrogen and it had plenty."
Senator Lodge declared that by leav

SAN FRANCISCO, April ". The
proceedings looking to the disqualifi
cation of I'nited States District Judge
William ('. Van Fleet from continuing
with the foreclosure of the Western
J'acific were continued until tomorrow
following the judge's denial of the
charges of bias and prejudice made
against him by the L'qtiitahle Trust
Company of New York.
That Judge Van Fleet will ignore the
tlemand for his disqualification was in
dicated by his statement that he in
tends to proceed as soon as possible
with the decree of sale and the windin
up of the receivership.
Judge Van Fleet admitted he had at
one time been the ow'ner of several
Western Pacific bonds but said that
he had disposed of them before the

WASHINGTON. April 7.--1 'resident
Wilson and his cabinet discussed at
length today the attacks on merchant
vessels carrying Americans and agreed
to defer any decisive steps while
awaiting the German government's re
ply to ;he inquiry of Ambassador Ger
ald as to whether German submarines
sank the Sussex, Englishman, llali
chester Engineer and Eagle Point.
The president and Secretary Lan
sing expect the desired infoimation
from Herlin to arrive at any time. A
prelimiuarv report from Mr. Gerard,
said in unofficial dispatcher
hern forvva'deel from Berlin
arrived here late tonight.
President Wilson left W

er. taking with him complete data on
the Sussex and other cases prepared
for hint at the strife department. He
expects to be away until Sunday
night or Monday morning unless def
inite word from Berlin is received in
the nnantime. Any information will
be sent to him immediately hy wire
less. Although some ranking officials of
the g jvei nmcr.t already have con
cluded that Germany is deliberately
attacking vessels regardless of the I
rights of neutrals, it is declared an
thoiitativ civ that the t'nited State
cannot question the German govern-,
meiit's good faith until full oppor-
tunity has been allowed for a response j
to Ambassador Gerard's inquiries and
for a determination of whether sub-
marine commanders are supported
ul i
attacking vessels contrary to inter
rational law.
The administiation virtually has
concluded that a German submarine
torpedoed the Sussex, and officials
now consider the principal point at
issue to be whether Germany will
adequately punish the officer respon
sible. Just what punishment would
be considered adequate apparently has
not been determined.
Statements in Berlin press ditpuich
regarding the attitude of German of
ficials are taken by the administra
tion to forecast an admission of the
Sussex attack. The statement of
JSiPimermann, under secretary fur

eign altairs that in such an avent ;
Germany would lie ready to meet the

The region northwest of Verdun

of sanguinary encounters between the
I Frem h and the Hermans.
Continuing their vigorous counter
j attacks on the trenches taken from
them by the Germans between Kethin-

captured additional portions of their
lost ground, and in addition made
progress in the communi' atin.g

Around Haucourt the Germans
launched a violent attack against the
French, making some pi ogress by
heavy bombardment. The French,
however, through the use of their

Germans to retreat, leaving numerous
dead on the ground as they made
their way back to their trenches. c in

On the eastern front there has been
a continuation of lively artillery en

Today's meeting attracted to the city
numerous state committee chairmen
and other party leaders. Among these
there was nine h informal discussion of
possible presidential candidates and
issues.
Recent reports that Colonel Roosevelt
had indicated a willingness to accept
the presidential nomination formed the
basis of several impromptu conferences
and interchanges of view between poli
ticians. Several state leaders pointed out that
about forty per cent of the delegates to
the convention have been cho-er. and
said that an investigation showed com
paratively few supporters of Roosevelt
among them.. Other party leaders
agreed with this, although none of
them would allow his name to be used
iu connection with a statement at this
time.
Many of the lead-is declared that
what sentimen had crystallized in their
slates was largely in favor of Justice
Hughes although Senator Cummins,
foi mer Senator Burton. Charles W.
Fairbanks, Senator Sherman and other
favorite sons had many supporters.
It was the consensus of opinion that
about 7m per cent of the delegates in
the convention would be uninstructed.
The subcommittee adopted a resolu
tion declaring that seats would be
provided only for the exact number of
delegates provided for in the official
call, and states electing double the
number of authorized delegates with
a half vote each would have to settle
the question of those entitled to seats
before the convention meets
The committee ruled it would not
hear contests from states electing dele
gates by direct primary and that .in
these states the delegates certified by
the secretary of state would be placed
on the temporary roll without question.
This action will, it is believed, reduce
the number of contests to a minimum.
The only contests thus far reported
are from Georgia and Louisiana. ,
Secretary Reynolds will open head
quarters in ( hicago to receive notice of
contests about May 10.

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON", April 7. Recurring
reports that the Carranza government,
had asked, formally or otherwise, for
withdrawal of the American forces
from Aiexico were disposed of tonight
by a statement from Secretary Lan
sing. He flatly denied that such ;i
reiiuest had been made, formally or
by intimation or suggestion.
Mr. Iansiiig- explained that when
the American expedition was ordered
across the border to pursue Villa,
General Carranza had incpiired of Up
state department regarding the pro
posed strength of the force and cam
paign plans contemplated. Since then
tli,. de fa'to government has been
kept advised constantly regarding the;
progress of the case.
Relief in some cpiarters that Car
ranza had asked or soon would ask
hoc.- much further into Mexico tho
I'nited States intended to send its
soldie-s has been based ou the belief
that Villa's trail was getting "cold."
Recent state department advices have
given no clue to the outlaw's where
abouts. The last report several days
ago had him hicated near Salevo.
Since then department agents have
reported inability to secure any fur-th-T
definite cine. An encouraging
feature of the campaign todav was
found in reports to both state and
war departments indicalinu actual co
operation between the American and
i de. factor government troops. News
from the border was to the effect
that the Americans had penetrated as
far south os cieneguillas. near Satevo.
A dispatch from American Consul
l.etrh.-r .it Chihuahua through Gen
eral Hell repotted an engagement a'
"Cianeguilla" cn April 4 between Car
ranza troops under General Gaviazos
ate! fifty Villa bandits, in which tin:
outlaws lost ten killed and two cap
tured. Mr. Letcher also confirmed
reports of the fight April 1 between
Tenth cavalry troops under Colonel
Drown with a Villa hand at Aguas

cutlavvs were reported killed.
