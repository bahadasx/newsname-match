F:1 Paso. Texas. April .-The Impera
tive need of utilizing the Mexican Cen
tral Railroad as a supporting line of
communication for the American troops
in Mexico was made obvious today by
the definite information that Villa is
heading for Torreon and not Durango.
On this account confirmation of the re
port that Gen. Carranza has granted
permission to use the railway lines is
awaited with much anxiety.
Measure a distance 440 miles from
Juares South along the tracks of the
Central and it will be possible to place
a finger on the spot which represents
the district through which the bandit
chieftain is peaing tonight. His object

possible. Reyes is reported to be just
north of Torreon, guarding the road to
pervent the passage of Carranza troops
northward.

Gen. John J. Perhing is personally
leading the paraning forece of American
troops, but they are enty a day's ride
.outh of Satevo, which leaves them far
bwhind.
This information was received today
from Consul Letcher at Chihuahua. The
consul obtained his report by telephone
communication established with one of
Gen. Persbing's staff.
The established line of communication
from Columbus south is now one-third
greater in lenth than the route tra
versed by the railroad. In many places
supplies can only be transported by pack
mules, and then in small quantities.
Col. William C. Brown, of the Tenth
Cavalry. whose command fought an en
gagement with Villistas near Bachiniba
on April 1. passed Cusihuiriachic on April
4. iis offlial report to Gen. Funston
shows that only three Mexicans were
I.illed in the Itachiniba fight. Instead of
thirty or forty, as first reported in un
ofmelia news.
The first news of this light was ob
tained from native ranchmen by Gen.
Pershing and forwarded to the base at
Columbus. The correeti report of cas
ualties among the Villistas furnishes a
fair example of the ability of the Mexi
cans to exaggerate.
10,000 Soldiers Guard Line.
Gen. Luis Gutierrez, commander of
the Carransa troops in Chihuahua. has
made a report of a fight which occur
red several days ago between a de
tachment of Carransistas and Villistas
near Clenegulllas. This Is just south
of Satevo. Ten Villistas are said to
have been killed and two taken pris
oners.
It was learned from an authorita
tive military source that the total
strength of the American forces south
of the border is now between 12,000
and 14.04 men. The cavalry troops
actually engaged in the pursuit of
Villa number less than 2,000. This In
cludes a second column which arrived
at Cutlhuiriachlc on Thursday to
support the extreme advance.

First Chief Wants U. S. Troops to
Leave Within Month-Food
Shortage Serious.
Unwillingness on the part of the Ameri
can government to limit its pursuit of
Villa to any particular time or territory
has halted the negotiations between the
State Department and the de facto gov
ernment of Mexico for a protocol to gov
ern the chase.
Gen. Carranza. it was learned last
night, is disposed to insist that after a
month or sixty days, Pershing's forces,
if Villa has not been caught in the mean
time. should be withdrawn, and is press
ing for a definite statement from the
United States on this score.
Also, it is stated. Carransa is desirous
of fixing rigidly the limits of territory
within which the American troops shall
operate in that time, and of prescribing
in the protocol just how tar they may
approach any town; and be emoned for a
statement from the Washington govern
ment as to how much farther Persh
ing's men will penetrate into Mexico.
Fed Shortage Bestena.
In the meantime, the situation with re
spect to the use of the railroads to pro
vision the American expedition remains
one of uncertainty. Officials were dis
posed to take much satisfaction from the
reports that a shipment had been started
from JuareSr to the Mormon colony at
Cases Grandes, which is supplying Persh
Ing under a contract, although it was
admitted that there was no guarantee
that such shipments in the future will
not be interfered with.
That a ser us shortage of food threat
ens the advance columns of the American
expedition was Indieated in official dis
patches which reached the War Depart
ment yesterday.

Chicago. Ill., April 7.-An interna
tional plot to assassinate all the rulers
of Europe bas been discovered by
State's Attorney MacLay Hoyne, ac
cording to- an announcement by him
this afternoon.
Mr. Hoyne's investigators stumbled
upon the information while investigat
ing the poisoning of more than 100
prominent men at the banquet in
honor of Archbishop Mundelein at the
University Club in Chicago.
The plot was hatched in Chicago and
other large cities. The plan was to
use poison in a manner similar to that
employed at the Mundelein banquet.
Bombs were not to be resorted to un
less "absolutely necessary."
The identity of the anarchist- Who
revealed the plot to the State's attor
ney is being concealed in the belief
that knowledge of the tact that he
had betrayed his comrades would lead
to his immediate death.

fact that many faced a walk of miles,
the situation was met jokingly. * Approzi

The entire system of the Washington

paralyzed by a strike order given at 11
o'clock yesterday morning.
Following the refusal of General Man
