from Mexico were disposed of tonight
liv a statement from HccrHliu-v l.iiiis-
'"""'jiiig. lie flatly denied that such a re

Mr. Lansing explained that when (ho

posed strength of the force and cam
paign plans contemplated. Since then

have reported Inability to secure any

An encouraging feature of the cam
paign today was found in reports to
both state arid war departments Indl-
eating actual co-opernt Ion between

I A dispatch from American Consul
I Letcher, at Chihuahua, through Gen
leral Hell, reported an engagement at
"Clanegiiilla" on April 4 between Car
rana troops under General Gavazos
and fifty Villa bandits, In which tho
outlaws lost ten killed and two cap
tured. Mr. Detcher also confirmed;
reports of the fight Anrll 1 between
Tenth cavalry troops under Colonel
llrown with a Villa hand, at Atrial Cal-
M Ionics, in which between thirty nnd
forty outlaws were reported killed.
The consul's report , united Colonel
Brown as saying that for two weeks
his command had subsisted largely on
beef mid corn, but that a mining com
pany had brought In a speclul train
of supplies, Including forage, to re
plenish th(. American stores. Offi
cials believed It was possible the spe
cial train of supplies referred to was
the one which left Juarez yesterday.
Difficulties of communication were.
Indicated by the fact that Consul Let
cher's dispatches were sent on tho
Mexican wires and addressed to Gen
eral Bell at hi Paso, Instead of to tho
stale department.
The state department received of
ficial reports tonight that the value
of Carta nza currency had risen mate
rially during the last few days, over
