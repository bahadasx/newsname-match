the t;ht. A vote ..n this provision
probably will be taken late today.
Sentiment in the senate is strongly
v favor of a government nitrate

military affairs committee to rec-
j ommerid it in connection with the
I army bill may defer its passage
; until later in the preparedness pro

, training to fit soldiers for return to

WASHINGTON, April S. The
administration shipping bill, father
' ed by Sec'y of the Treasury McAdoo
I and endorsed by Pres't Wilson, is
; strngly opposed by tho interstate
I commerce commission. The action of
the recent conferences among ad
! ministration leaders in charge of the
i measure in arranging to take from
' the shipping bill t-he provisions
which would empower a shipping
1 board to fix rates was ihe result of
the objection to the bill registered
by the interstate commerce commis
sion. The commission submitted, to
the house committee on merchant
(marine and fisheries which has the
shipping bill in charge, a lengthy
report which stated that if enacted
into law the shipping bill would
practically overturn nil the regu
latory work which the interstate
commerce commission has spent .
