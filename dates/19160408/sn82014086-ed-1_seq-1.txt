The region northwest of Verdun,
around Haucourt and between Bethin
court and Hill 265. is still the r-ene of
sanguinary encounters between the
French and the Germans.
Continuing their vigorous counter
attacks on the trenches taken from
them by the Germans between Bethin
court and Hill 265, the French, with
the use of hand grenades, have recap
tured additional portions of their lost
ground and in addition mado progress
in communicating trenches.
Around Haucourt the Germans
launched a violent alack against the
French, previously having prepared the
way by a heavy bombardment lasting
several hours. The French, however,
through the use of their curtain of
fire and rapid fire guns, put down the
attack and forced the Germans to re
treat, leaving numerous dead on the
ground as they made their way back
to their trenches.
On the remainder of the front in
France and in Belgium, artillery en

FCR LETTER WRITING PURPOSES
Three Eags of Mail Received from
Troops in Mexico. -
Columhus. N. M.. April 7. Cardboard
used by advanced detachments of
American troops in .Mexico for letter j
writing purposes. Three bags of mail,
all written on bits of box, arrived at ;
the army base here today. Some of
tl soldiers contented themselves with
fashioning postcards, while others
made envelopes by folding a second
bit of the cardboard over the com
munication. This was taken by officers
here to substantiate reports that the
troops are close on the trail of Villa,
making all possible speed, not even
waiting for supplies.
A number of long messages were re
ceived from General Pershing for
transmission to General Funston at
San Antonio today, but none was made
public here. It was learned, however,
that General Perslvng reported that
the wounds suffered by four troopers
In the Guerrero engagement were so
trivial they were not regarded as
worth reporting and that all the men
are in the saddle again.
Only the usual unofficial reports
found their way across the border to
day, these in the main indicating that
the American cavalry, assisted by de
tachments of infantry, are searching
for Villa somewhere in the vicinity of
Rosalio on the Rio Conches, about 60
miles south of Chihuahua City.
Orders for the detachment of Apache
Indian scouts from the White mountain
reservation of Arizona to proceed to
the frontier at once were counter
manded by General Pershing today
and the Indians are being held here
for further orders. No explanation
could be obtained at military head
quarters. JOHN NOLAN RELEASED
FROM CANADIAN PRISON.
Was Convicted in 1900 of Trying to
Destroy the Welland Canal.
Chicago, April 7. John Nolan, who
with two others was con-irted in 19C0
of attempting to destroy the locks of
the Welland canal, has been released
from a Canadian prison, it was said
here today.
The announcement was mode by
F.c-tiard lIa:Gillian, a Chicago news
paperman, on authority of a communi
cation from Ji-hn E. Redmond, the Irish
leader.
John "Walsh, who was convicted
with Xolan, died in prison in 1909 and
Luke Dillon, another conspirator, was
released in 1914, according to Mr. Mac
Gillian, and owing to the efforts of
Mr. Redmond Xolan was to have been
given his freedom in 1914, but the wai
Interfered.
The attack on the cannl was plan
ned, it is said, for the purpose of cur
tailing shipments of supplies to British
soldiers in South Africa during the
Boer war.
Nolan, whose health is said to have
been impaired in prison, is on the
way to his wife and family in Dublin,
according to Mr. Redmond.
TROUBLE ON BAY STATE
RAILWAY ADJUSTED
Conductor Whose Discharge Caused
Strike, to Return to Work.
Boston, April 7. The differences be
tween the Bay 'State Street Railway
Company and its employes in the Wo
hurn division which resulted in a strike
recently, were settled today. The ad
justment was made without resort to
nrbitration, represent.-) tives of the com
pany and of the union agreeing to tha
restoration of duty of John J. Martin,
a conductor whose discharge was the
cause of the strike. It was said that
Martin had apolog)zed, admitting a vi
olation of a company rule.
The "farthest nortn" coai mine is
on the east coast of Spitzbergen, and
la owned by an American.
SANGUINARY NATURE
a continuation of the lively artillery
engagements in the lake region south
of Dvinsk, especially about Lake Na
rocz, where the Russians succeeded in
occupying portions of the German
trenches. The artillery on both sides
also has been busy around Riga and
Friedriehstadt and in East Galicia.
The Austrians have recaptured from
the Italians a ridge north of Monte
Cristabel and in the operation made a
number of prisoners and captured two
machine guns. Attacks by the Italians
in large force north of the Sugano val
ley were repulsed, according to Vien
na. Flood conditions along the Tigris
river are again hampering the British
force which is endeavoring to make its
way up the river to the relief of the
British besieged at Kut-el-Amara. In
the Caucasus region near the Black
sea coast the Russians have captured
Turkish positions along the Karadere
river and inland along the upper
Tchoruk river continue their progress
against the Ottomans despite the cold
and heavy snows.

vice is being rendered the company.

INDEPENDENCE OF CANTON,
CHINA. FORMALLY DECLARED
After a Conference of Military and
Naval Officers and Leading Citizens.
Shanghai, China, April 7. The In
dependence of Canton was formally
declared yesterday afternoon after a
conference of military and naval of
ficers and leading citizens with Lung
Kuang, governor of Kwang-Tung
province. Xo fighting took place.
The secession is considered import
ant here, an observance of the situa
tion look upon it as pointing to the
probable downfall of Yuan Shi Kal
and expect it to lead to the defection
of other southern provinces and
strengthens the hands of the south
ern leaders in their reiterated de
mand for Tuan's retirement and the
reinstitution of the Nanking consti
tution. The Influence at Peking of Vice
President Li Yan Hung and Secretary
of State Shu Shi Kwan and Miltan
Chi Jui, it is thought, may result in
the peaceful solution of the situation
that the southerners ardently . desire,
but Information from a usually well
Informed foreign source In Peking is
that Yuan Shi Kai will fight bitterly
The China Merchant Steamship com
pany has refused to transport north
ern troops to Canton. Lack of ton
nage available was given as the rea
son. The United States cruiser Cincin
nati is on her way to Amoy. The
Galveston Is due at Swatow tomor
row, when the Wilmington will sail
for Canton.
It is considered noteworthy that
there are no apprehensions for the
safety of foreigners.
MULE A RELIABLE
TRANSPORT ANIMAL.
Proved More Useful Than the Camel
in Mesopotamia Campaign.
-odosaprj ui sjajjunhpnaii u.sni-ifl
tamia, April 7. The mule has proved
a far more reliable and useful trans
port animal than the camel in the
Mesopotamian campaign. If beasts
were decorated, the mule would be
covered with ribbons. He knows not
defeat. His hardiness is proverbial;
none of the plagues of Mesopotamia
have affected his sangfroid.
The camel so far has been but an
auxiliary. The breed used here, called
"Judi," is not. like his "Bedawi"
brother, trained to go without water,
but he is proof against the ubiquitous
camel-fly, and has certain other vir
tues of his cwn. In spite of his nobbly
extremities and grotesquely propor
tioned limbs, the camel Is a dainty
beast. His muncing gait and super
cilious glances are generally attri
buted to poso; as a matter of fact they
are the expression o an-Triarr and
unsuspected delicacy. Too often the
camel's uncouth bulk gives a false im
pression of hardiness. He is not
hardy.
He is brittle, and will break his leg
kicking against a stone, and he will
split up and die if his legs slip apart
in the mud. In this country snow kills
him. He is as sensitive to damp as a
city clerk, and will catch a cold if
asked to sleep in a swamp.' But well
cared for, sufficiently equipped, and
tactfully treated, he is second only to
the mule as a beast of burden.
ACTION ON SUBMARINE
MATTER DEFERRED
Discussed at Length by President
Wilson and His Cabinet.
Washington, April 7. President Wil
son and his cabinet discussed at length
today the recent attacks on merchant
vessels carrying Americans and aiwi)
to defer any decisive step while
awaiting the German government's re
ply to the inquiry of Ambassador Ge
rard as to whether German subma
rines sank the Sussex, Englishman,
Manchester Engineer and Eagle Point.
The president and Secretary Lansing
expect the desired information from
Berlin to arrive at any time. A pre
liminary report from Mr. Gerard, said
in unofficial despatches to have been
forwarded from Berlin, had not ar
rived here late today.
President Wilson left Washington
tonight on the naval yacht Mayflower,
taking with him comnlete data on tho
Sussex and ' other cases prepared for
him at the state department. He ex
pects to be away until Sunday night
or Monday morning unless definite
word from Berlin is received in the
meantime. Any information will be
sent to him immcdiatly by wireless.
5,000 GOVERNMENT CLERKS

Congress to Get Enght Hour Day.
Washington, April 7. Approxi
mately 5,0i"K government clerks here
have formed a union and taken nmi
iation with the American Federation

ernment. Its aims are to be sought

Not Only Holds But Develops Trade
Anyone familiar with the various branches of business knows
that It is impossible to neglect or slight any on of them without feel
ing the effect of it. It Is of the utmost importance to keep them up
to a certain standard. Let the buying end lag and it la quickly recog
nized by the purchaser that his wants are better taken care of else
where. And when the selling end fails to give proper response there
is a telltale disclosure in the receipts.
Negligence never pays wherever it exists, and this is as true of
the advertising department or a business as anything else. It is one
of the vital parts of the selling end which hastens the turn over, and
the greater the circulation of an advertising medium the more value Is
its service. This, with the fact that it goes Into the homes, where the
needs originate and the buying is planned, is the reason why The Bul
letin affords exceptional opportunities for the merchant who is alive to
the increase of his business. Consistent use of its advertising columns
means not only the holding but the development of trade, and it wel
comes nothing more than an opportunity to prove it.
In the past week the following matter has appeared in its news
columns which are read daily by 43,000:

He explained his failure to report

unable to operate successfully and that

receipt of supplies which arrived at
Cusihuirachic April 3, had ngain Join

umn to arrive as far south as Cusi

April by Aeroplane and Motor
Courier to Columbus, X. M.. April 7.
The first aeroplane scouting over the
mountains, where the Villa forces fled
after they were dispersed in the bat
tle of Guerrero, was done near this
camp yesterday. The aviator, while
carrying messajtep, participated in a
search wit ha troop of cavalry for the
hiding places of a small band of Villa
bandits who two days before had es
caped Into a ridge of low mountains.
The aviator located some Mexicans
near the American camp from which
the cavalry had started. The peculiar
garb of the Mexicans was easily dis
tinguishable from the plane from that
of the American soldiers, he said.
These Mexicans were not Villa men.
but residents of the country about the
camp.
