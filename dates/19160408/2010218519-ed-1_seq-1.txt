I The Pioneers
W By C. C. Qoodwin
IT is good to seo the
saints bring their chil-
M dren in to conference.
I We wonder if many of
1 r them stop to tell their
'children the beautiful
story of the evolution
that the full history
pictures, since the day
- that the first weary
' ' . company came down
the eastern mountains
and halted here.
f That was Salt Lake's
first moving picture;
there has been none
like it since. Contem-
plating it the temple,
. the hotels, theatres,
'' churches, hospitals,
great business houses
r- and stately homes;
the temples to R e-
ligion, to Learning, to
Industry, to Justice and
Mercy all vanish away;
the roar of business be-
comes still; the silence
which the desert
broods comes back;
gardens vanish, the
flowers all fade; there
is nothing as now seen
save the surrounding
mountains; the lake
shimmering in the dis
tance, the sun shining
J down from above, and
the desolation that
wrapped all this region
'round like a burial
robe. Even the
branches on the few
stunted trees hung
drooping like funeral
R , plumes, while the sough
l of the breeze coming
I down from the hills or
up from the lake was as
mournful as is the re
quiem chanted on the
shores of the Styx.
i The way a state is
carved out of a wilder
I ness and rounded into
8 form is always an inter-
I esting theme. The way
I the first stakes of
1 civilization were driven
(, in Utah was drama-
B v' tic enough to be set
I to words for the stage.
I In their penury and
I distress, the first act of
1 the Utah pioneers was
s to sink upon the earth;

mr MORE kindly and benevolent man has seldom held an exalted ecclesiastical position in these
1 latter days than President Joseph F. Smith of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
m I Saints. Passing down the seventy-seventh year of the highway of life, and living with broad
S- - tolerance of the affairs of men he stands a commanding influence in his state. To his peo
ple he is the great spiritual leader. To men at large he is a man of wide sympathies, great business
acumen and a born leader of the great institution of which he is the head.
One, who has known him for two generations, says of him: "Once stern and unrelenting, he has
mellowed as the years go on, until he sees but the good in humanity and forgives men their
trespasses."
His early life was of great hardship, surviving as he did many adventures and many soul-rending
experiences that try the hearts of men.
He is the son of Hyrum Smith, second patriarch of the church and brother of the Prophet Joseph
Smith. He was born November 13, 1838, at Far West, Missouri. He came into the world at the
beginning of the early troubles of his people. His mother fled with him from Nauvoo, Illinois.
At the age of eight years he drove an ox team across the desert. He reached Salt Lake with
his mother September 23, 1848. For the next six years he endured terrible hardships in common with
the pioneers. In the year 1854 he was called on a mission to the Sandwich Islands, returning to
Utah in 1858. He went on a mission to Great Britain in 18G0, returning in 18G3. lie returned to
the Sandwich Islands in 18G4 and afterwards was employed in the office of the church historian.
Ho was in charge of the endowment house after the death of President Young until it was closed.
On July 1, 18GG, he was ordained as an apostle.

not in prayer for help, M
not in lamentation and H
despair but in a glad
Praise Service and in M
thanks to the Power M
that had led them M
through the waste and
over the transfixed bil- M
lions of the everlasting M
hills to a place or re.sf.
Then their work be-
gan. They were not M
dreaming of fortunes. M
The struggle before M
them was to live and H
that struggle continued M
almost without abate- M
ment to the end. Often
only the barest necessi- M
ties were vouchsafed; M
few comforts, no lux- M
uries. In that rough H
friction their youth was H
worn away; the men M
surrendered their ambi- M
tions, the women folded M
fond dreams and a M
thousand innocent long- M
ing in their hearts and M
drew the silence of M
self-sacrifice and self- M
abnegation over them M
forever. M
But then a miracle M
commenced. .The des- H
ert began to transfer M
the wrinkles and the M
sadness from its som- M
bre face to theirs, while H
in turn it began to ab- H
sorb the splendor or H
their youth, and to H
cause it to be reflected H
in flowers and fruits H
and golden grain and H
vines in which the H
birds made their nests H
and filled all the soft BR
air with their songs. HI
Later still, as though H
touched with pity, the H
irresponsive mountains H
began to swing back H
their adamantine doors H
revealing the treas- H
ures within, where they H
had remained secreted, H
waiting until the time H
should be ripe for the H
coming of progress and H
enlightenment. H
The o v e r-wearied B
eyes of those Pioneers H
have mostly all closed; H
their hands, gnarled by H
labor, are nearly all H
folded, but the miracle H
is still being perform- H
