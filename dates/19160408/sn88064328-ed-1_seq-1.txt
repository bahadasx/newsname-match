AN OLD CJ
lilCATE.
J ask you 1 ml .1 ciV.st of broad
A place to lay my fie Inn g head
A shelter w'here the soul may keep
Its l.orly from tlie snowdrifts' deep.
A soldier old from the door lie sent
1 hough white his hair, his form su heilt
A .shiver'.iijr there of hungers' eold
His story thus lie might have told—
"Oncfi on a day a wealthy lad
Left home—dear fireside all he had—
And clothed in simpi
To Richmond went t
suit of gray
join the tray
My land the South and under Lee
I strove for flag so dear to me
I saw it through full many a light
Believing that my cause was right.
"E'en yet the eyes may fill with tears
Recalling oft tliose hitter years
That left behind a barren waste
Where sorrows wreck the home displaced.
"No braver did the beast defend
The cubs that lay within her den
Than we who wore the simple gray
And inarched the soldi rs bloody way.
e know not what a pay day meant
lliiough years of hardships sent
In rags and hunger thus ,e fought
As though our wants w 'ie ever naught.
"Though Lee our brave ,r of the brave.
Our country's cause he could not save
Though Southland fell as doomed to fall
All ventured we and io/t our all.
"And then indeed our cause was deau
Hope winged a.s hope is want and lied
And homes lay in a barren waste
By Northern triumph th :n disgraced.
"And few are left ta tell the tale
To hear the cry, that of orphans' wail
Or see the tears by poor hearts shed,
Of mothers weeping o'er the dead.
"And 1 who yet had done my best
Seek now a haven but to rest
Of health, of fortune, all bereft
'Tis waning life that is but left
"A vulture came into my home
And I might go the world to roam
Of all I had I'm left alone
to claim what-was' Bty own.* » ■
"Yet why bewail the bygone days
And chide the Northman for his sway
Too soon beneath the sod I'll be
And earth shall not remember me.
"Hard have I toiled far paltry bread—
To hold a shelter o'er my head:
Ah! soon to well earned rest I'll go,
Where neither want or cold shall know.
"A Southern soldier, old and poor,
Stands here before the vultures door.
And passes on, 'twill soon be o 'er
Pass on—to death s eternal shore
"And then he turned and faced the blast
As often in days of the past •
Departed walked, and a chilly creep
Stole 011 him with an unwak'ning sleep.
And one of Georgia's soldiers brave
Siept there, there snowdrift for his grave:
Tlie battle's reveille no more
Mig ht call to arms, might call 110 more.
New Orleans, 1893 —Madge Brkdiam.

TRICKERY AND DUPLICITY
IN POLITICS.
The Democrats of Louisiana re
sponded to the candidacy of Ruf
fin G. Pleasant in the primary
election in a manner that irrevo
cably set the seal of popular dis
approval on the pretensions of the
Progressive candidate for Gover
nor.
Mr. Parker had requested all
"independent" Democrats who in
tended to vote for him in the gen
eral election to abstain from vot
ing in the Democratic primary. It
did not require this request from
Mr. Parker to call the attention
of voters registered as Democrats
to the fact that their voting in the

that had done great good. I began

Democratic primary obligated
them to vote for the nominees of
that primary. Duplicity in such
matters would be no different
from practicing duplicity in a
■purely personal matter.
Mr. Parker well knew that the
only possible hope of his candi
dacy lay in a light vote in The
Democratic primary, which might
be construed as disapproval of
his Democratic opponents, or as
showing that the people were at
least in a receptive moud for the
presentation of his claims for
their suffrage.
But the answer to his request,
as expressed in the heavy vote in
the primary, and overwhelming
majority given Colonel Pleasant,
was so emphatically negative that
it would have completely disillu
sioned and disconcerted anyone
not of a quixotic temperament.
The result of that primary left
only the dernier resort fo|r the
continued candidacy of Mr. Par
ker —an appeal to Democrats to
desert the party of their choice,
the party of their subscribed affi
liation, and, for the sake of ad
vancing the political fortunes qf
Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Parker, to
violate their obligation to support
the nominee of the Deocratic pri
mary.
In what a distorted vision must
such an appeal be based ! It is
said that a drowning man will
clntch at a straw. The dire po
litical waten in whieh the Pro
gressive candidate for Governor
is floodering are a fitting resting

place for political ambitions which
do not hesitate to appeal to du
plicity to bolster its pretensions.
This strange appeal must fall on
upheeding ears. It may well
cause wonder at its boldness ;,nd
lack of propriety. Its inevitable
logic leads to hut one conclusion;
Can one who appeals to anotner
tüf violate a clearly defined moral
obligation absolve himself from
the consequences of such appeal
—can lie ask another to do some
thing whieh he cannot admit he
would do: himself, without giving
rn inference that the other
is his inferior?
If the moral obligation in tliisl
matter is denied, then it must be !
thereby admitted that trickery
and duplicity in politics are de- ;
fensible when they serve what
ever may be claimed to be a good 1
purpose.—Baton Rouge Chronicle
