SHIPS WAITING TO
GO THROUGH CANAL
Washington, April 8. In antlclpa
tion of the re-opening of the Panama
canal on April 15, a number of ves
sels have gathered at the termini,
around South Amorica by way of the
Straits of Magellan. The members of
the operating force who haco been on
furlough in the United States havo all
been recalled to the isthmus. Vessels
drawing up to 30 feet of water will
be admitted to tho canal first but it
is said that the draft can bo increas
ed materially later, unless the slides
show signs of renewed activity.
A great accumulation of goods on
tho wharves at Cristobal and Balboa
for lack of bottoms to caruy it away
has obliged tho Panama railroad com
pany to place an embargo on all car
goes from the United States or Europe
destined to ports on tho west coast
south of Cullao. This shortage of
bottoms is directly chargeable to the
European war which has disrupted tho
steamship service and broken up their
schedules.

..horento signed the Hoot statement de-
(
clared there was nothing behind it
except a deslro to promote the nomi
nation of Mr Root Ho denied em
phatically that the statement was a
maneuver to help the candidacy of
Colonel Roosevelt
It was learned today that the Root
movement crystallized at a meeting
held here last Thursday at the Union
League club. Mr. Root, it is said,
knew that the statement was to bo
issued and offered no objection.
Nineteen of those who signed the
Root statement are delegates from
New York state to the national con
vention Among them aro two of the
four delegates at large. Senator Jas.
Wadsworth, Jr., and State Senator
Elon R, Brown. Aftor eulogizing the
public services of Mr. Root, the state
ment concludes
"While he has declined to become
a candidate for the highest public of
fice yet if nominated for the presi
dency by the coming national conven
tion, his Benso of public duty must
compel his acceptance."
