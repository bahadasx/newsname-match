"I do not know the details of any
plan of Home and State. If any, for
the elimination of candidates for the
senate and therefor would not be
willing to discuss the same, especial
ly in the absence of any Information
with respect thereto.
"Of course, any proposition front
patriotic men or from any patriotic
publication should always have re
siiertful consideration."
When Dr. Barton was shown the
above response from the former gov
ernor, particularly the last paragraph,
he turned to the reporter with
smile of satisfaction, and said: "Now
that Is what I call the reply of a
statesman."
It will be remembered that Samuel
Palmer Brooks. George V. Riddle and
John Davis, the other pro candidates,
have repeatedly declared their lnten
eral prominent Democrats Insisted to
the last that by holding the senatorial
primary without first testing lu le
gality, the Democratic party Is run
nnk the danger of a contested election
and possibly a Republican senator.
Toe sech of Governor Ferguson,
who took an emphatic stand agaiast
the Ignoring of the senatorial primary
law, apparently had great effect on
th minds of the committeemen.
Governor Ferguson declared the
Democrats of the state have no more
right to kxnore the senatorial primary
law than they have lo Ignore any oth
