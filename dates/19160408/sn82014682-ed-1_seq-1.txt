' SHANGHAI. China, April :K)n
the fiercest battle waged since the
beginning of the revolution- in China,
the revolutionary troops won a signal
victory over an army of 100,000 of
Yuan's troops at Nachi yesterday aft
ernoon. Of the entire army of the
monarchists 40.000 were killed f and
wounded and manyj were taken pris
oners. . '
At a loss ofnearly half the number
of soldiers the revolutionists finally
carried a stronghold on one of the
heights, and took the position under
heavy fire. For nine hours the troops
on both sides captured position after
position, and .entire regiments were
wiped out in the battle along the lit
tle river near Nachi. ' i ; 1
Yuans troops had made a flank
movement and were attempting a
drive into Yunnan when the revolu
tionary troops of Yunnan and Kwei
hau made a stand in the Szechuen
province, and the battle began which
lasted for hours. , Altogether the re
publican forces fought with a purpose,
and although outnumbered by the
monarchists, succeeded after a hard
fight to Becure a strong position and
held it until evening. ; ;
Yuan's remaining troops beat a re
treat to one of the strongholds in the
Zechuen province, but the victory
for the, revolutionists practically en' Is
the campaign for the monarchists in
this section, as reinforcements for th;
republicans are coming up from
Kwangsi and Kweichau.
This is the first battle of the war
where the killed and wounded has run
over 10,000, and it is perhaps the last
of the big battles during the revolu
tion, unless Yuan intends to send his
Peking troops to make an attack "on
Shansi. .... . .. ... "

ent of Attorney Lorrin Andrews, her

to her sanity and mental competency.
Judge Stuart nas no right to declare
and hold , that Liliuokalani may not
