Washington. April 8. Secre
tary Lansing confirmed reports
from Queretaro that counter proposals
had been made to the Carranza gov
ernment in connection with the pro
posed protocol. These were under
stood to be today before Carranza
and his cabinet. The secretary would
not disclose their nature.
Regarding use of the Mexican rail
ways. Secretary Lansing MWirt the fol
lowing formal statement:
"I do not- consider the railroad
question worthy of consideration. It
really isn't a factor in the situation
any longer.'
He indicated this government if? en
tirely satisfied with the transportation
situation.
The problem of sending supplies to
the American manhunters in Mexico
gav- the war department and state
department less concern today than
for some time past.
Explain Agullar's Report
Desuite Foreign Minister Aguilar s
statement at Quaretaro that per mis
sion had not been given the United
States to transport food supplies, army
men freely stated they had found a
way out of their trouble through the
aid of a mining company of sending
pecia 1 supply trains from El Paso.
This movement probtbly can be re
pealed A;;uilar's statement was regarded as
for "home consumption." Literally it
is true, but actually Carranza agreed
to permit the "commercial use" of
the Xori h western line.
While Carranza's permission had
MiitiL-s attached and still requires ne-
gotiations to make it fully operative,
officials believed t here would be no
further hitch in view of the permit to
mining men to carrv needed supplies.
Villa Near Patral.
Kl Paaoi April 8. Information from
Mexican sources today said Villa had
reached the environs of Parral and
had sent emissaries into the town to
test the spirit of the garrison and alt o
to secure provisions. As usual with
such reports no verification was pos
sible hut the fart that the bandit was
reliably reported to have IMM only
fifty-five miles from Parral two days
ago gave c dor to the story.
The information served at last to
act as a considerable damper on the
h"pes of those who thought that the
bandit's career might be ended by an
other brilliant dash na the part f the
America n troopers who have pushed
south of Satevo.
Army officers here said a repetition
of Colonel Oodd's exploit was hardly
likely m view of the great distance of
tile adva nee corps from the nearest
apply base unless Villa w.-.s within
or M miles of the Americans. If
he has reached Parral it is said -.he
chase mast settle down into a steads
grind with the issue to be decided as
an endurance test between the United
States soldiers and t he bandits.
Pohii Harder Humors.
Washington. April 8. Official de
nial of persistent reports that the de
fat i government of Mexico had asked
far withdrawal of the American troops
was expected here today to set at rest
all such rumors.
Secretary Lansing emphatically de
nied that any such request had been
made formally or otherwise.
State and war department officials

Smith assured house members to
day that Secretary Baker is genuinely

WASSON WILL
TRY FOR MORE
CITY INTEREST
Commissioner of Finance Will
Demand of Topeka Banks
That They Pay Three Per Cent
on City Deposits.
THINKS IT IS A GOOD RATE
Would Not Antagonize Them by
Asking a Greater.
Increase Would Equal About
Double His Salary.
Commissioner of Finance Wasson's
attempt to take refuge behind the or
dinance which states that the city
commissioners "shall select such
banks as may be practicable ' for the
city depositories fell flat this morn
ing when an investigation revealed the
fact that the present commission has
never even passed on the banks that
are to hold the city's funds. It is
merely a hold-over custom from the
last commission for they are the ones
who made the selection and the com
missioners when seen this morning
emphatically stated that their atten
tion had never before been called to
the fact that the city was losing thou
sands of dollars yearly by not receiv
ing as much from the "banks of Topeka
for its money as did the state, until
they read it in the State Journal.
Commissioner Wasson is quoted in
the morning paper as saying. 'So far
as making the banks pay more in
terest on the city's deposits, all I can
do is to ask them to pay more."
"Have you ever asked them to pay
more for the use of the city's money?"
he was asked.
"No." he replied. "1 never have."
"Why have you never asked for
more interest?"
Again he turned to the ordinance
book and attempted to show that it
was a matter up to the commissioners
as a whole.
"Don't you intend to ask for more?
he was asked.
Will Ask for More.
"Oh yes, I intend to ask for three
per cent."
"Why don't you ask for as much as
the state gets for its money?"
"Well, 1 consider three per cent a
pretty good rate of interest for the
banks to pay." he replied.
"Is not the city's money worth just
as much as is the. state's?"
"Oh yes, yes, of course it is, but I
want to work this thing through
smoothly, I don't want to antagonize
the banks," he said.
"Don't you consider the tax payers'
interests above those of the banks?"
he was asked, but he was busy looking
at the ordinance book and there was
no answer.
Again the attention of the other city
commissioners was called to the fact
that the city was losing money by re
ceiving only 2 per cent on its deposit?
and that Commissioner Wasson con
stantly referred to the fact that he was
guided so lely by the ordinance which

FARlOALlS UP
Worth of Land Gains 25.76 Per
Cent in Four Years.
War Demand for Grain Made
11.5 Per Cent Increase in 1915.
Washington. April 8. Farm land
lvalues are increasing almost by leaps
' and bounds. Figures made public
j today by the department of agriculture
j show that values for the United States
; taken as a wholle increased 25.76 In
i the last four years and 11.5 last year,
j The figures are based upon reports
j from the department's field agents.
The value of farm lands without im
s provements is estimated at $45.50 per
! acre, compared with $40. S5 a year
ago. $40.30 two years ago. $38.10 three
years ago and $36.23 four years ago.
Increases have been general with
one or two notable exceptions In the
northwest.
The exceptional increases of last
year are attributed in part to the re
action in the south, owing to last
year's temporary depression and to the
stimulus of war prices, particularly of
grains. The percentage increases in
! the past year by sections are:
North Atlantic states, 10 ; eastern
j part of north central states, 9; western
; part of the north central states, 12;
j South Atlantic states, 19; south cen
j tral states, 11 ; and the far western
j states, 11.
END OF GOLD WEATHER
Fair and Wanner Is the Forecast for
Sunday.
Topeka got only the extreme edge of
the cold wave last night and the
mercury did not go below the freezing
mark. Cold weather was general over
the western part of the state, how
ever, the lowest reading reported being
14 degrees at Goodland. Rain and
snow fell in nearly ail parts of the
state and was still falling in the east
ern district this morning. The sky
was clear in western Kansas this
morning and is expected to ciear here
by tonight.
Another special warning was sent
out to shippers this morning by the
weather bureau. The forecast reads
to protect 36-hour shipments north
and west against temperatures of 16
to 20 degrees; east and south, 20 to 25
degrees. The reading of 25 degrees
will probably touch Topeka, coming
24 hours late, according to S. D. Flora,
local obseVver.
The lowest temperature at Topeka
this morning was 3 2 degrees at 5
o'clock. Rain and snow measuring
three-hundredths of an inch fell early

Carranza Official Belie ves Pur-

WANTS TROOPERS WITHDRAWN
Washington Has No Sueh He-

Funstoil Alone Can Declare
Invasion at an Knd.
Washington. April 8. 'The original
order given Major General Funston on
March 10 for the American punitive
expedition into Mexico made public
for the first time at the war depart
ment today did not include instruc
tions for the death or capture of Villa
but principally directed dispersal of
Villa's outlaw band that -attacked
Columbus. N. M.t on March 9.
General Funston's order read:
"You will promptly organize an
adequate force of military troops un
der the command of Brig. Gen. John
J. Pershing and will direct him to pro
ceed promptly across the border in
pursuit of the Mexican band which
attacked the town of Columbus and
the troops there on the morning of
March 9. These troops will h with
drawn to American territory as soon
as the de facto government of Mexico
is able to relieve them of this work.
In any event the work of these troops
will be regarded as finished as soon
as1 Villa's band or bands are known
to be broken up.
Order Iom War Department.
"In carrying out these instructions
you are authorized to employ whatever
guides or interpreters are necessary.
You are given general authority to
employ such transportation including
motor transportation with necessnry
civilian personnel as may be required.
"You are instructed to make all
practicable use of the aeroplanes at
San Antonio for observation. Tele
graph for whatever reinforcements or
material you need. Notify this office
as to force selected and expedite
movement."
Brigadier General Scott. chief of
staff. declared today that General
Funston had not yet reported that this
task had been accomplished. The
Mexican embassy today announced
that no advices hnd been received
from General Carranza that the de
facto government forces were pre
pared or desired to relieve American
troops and assume the task itself.
General Scott would express- no opin
ion as to whether he believed the
orders to General Funston has been
completely carried out.
Deny Withdrawal Report.
Recurrence of reports that Ameri
can troops were to be withdrawn from
Mexico were met today at the state de
partment with a statement by Secre
tary Lansing that no such withdrawal
was contemplated so far as he knew
and at the war department by publi
cation for the first time, of the orig
inal order to Major General Funston.
Publication of the order disclosed
that it made no mention of taking
"Villa dead or alive," which was de
scribed as its purpose by officials
when it was issued. It was said to
day, however, that the instructions to
disperse the Villa bands cover what
ever action its execution entails,
lob's Done, Says Carranzista.
El Paso, April 8. The American
troops have accomplished their object
in destroying Villa's military power
and should therefore be withdrawn
from Mexico without delay, was the
view expressed today by a well known
member of the Carranza government,
speaking unofficially.
"Now Time to Withdraw."
"The punitive force." he said, "has
done all it could expect to do. It has
shattered the forces of Villa, who is
now a fugitive, robbed of all prestige
he ever held among the people. The
peons may be ignorant, but they are
no fools. They well never again re
spect a man who turned tail and ran
like a coward bef ore the Yankees,
without making a stand.
"Meantime, it must be admitted
that the Mexican people have behaved
well toward the American troops. They
have received them courteously. But
to allow them to remain in Mexico in
definitely. 2,000 men hunting for a
single bandit, who may not be caught
for months, is another matter. To al
low them to continue their progress to
the south indefinitely is still more
serious.
"Americans would not tolerate the
presence of a Canadian military force
within their borders. Similarly the
presence of Americans is beginning to
irritate the Mexican people. It looks
and feels like a surrender of sover
eignty. With Villa crushed now is the
logical time for the punitive force to
withdraw. No causes of conflict have
yet arisen and the affair has so far
turned out fortunately for both sides "

SUPREME COURT BEGiSiOHS
Puts a Stop to Release of Be;ir
Wagon Drivers
By the I'se of Habeas Corpus
Writs at K. C.
Drivers of automobiles must "stop,
look and listen,'' when approaching a
railway crossing where the driver is
I unable to gain a view of the track.
Failure to observe this rule, is at the
risk Of the motor car owner and suit
' for damages cannot be maintained
j when the rule is violated.
! That was the decision of the su
! preme court today in reversing the
; action of the Stnwnee county district
' court and setting aside a judgment
which W. A. Wehe of Topeka secured
! against the Atchison. Topeka & Santa
j Fe Railway company. The court, in
deciding the case, held that Dr. Wehe
did not use due diligence and care in
a voiding a collision with freight cars
; being pushed by a switch engine.
Dr. Wehe had taken his car to the
plant of an oil company, where he
; secured gasoline for his engine. In
leaving the property of the oil com
! pany and seeking to cross the Missouri
Pacific and Santa Fe tracks, the To
; peka man was unable to see the rail
way tracks as he attempted crossing
; at Adams street. His view was ob
structed by buildings and the driver of
: the car did not leave his machine to
I look for an approaching train, al
; though he said that he listened for the
; approach of cars.
An employee of the oil company
; went with Or. Wehe to look for a
: train. The oil man saw the switch
engine first and yelled to Dr. Wehe
I to "lookout." A brakeman saw the
j Wehe car and signalled the engineer
but was unable to prevent a collision.
Dr. Wehe brought suit for damages
i and secured a judgment in the district
court. The verdict was set aside on
, the ground that due diligence was not
I shown by the driver of the car.
Kansas Uw Applies.
Laws regulating the payment of
j damages for failure to deliver a tele
gram, apply to the state to which the
' message was sent and not the state
from which it was sent. That was
; the ruling f the supreme court today
! in affirming a decision of the Shaw
! nee county district court in a suit
brought by Charles C. Bailey of To
peka against the Western Fnion.
A telegram announcing the death
' of Bailey father was sent from Var
ment to Topeka. The messages was
delayed in transmission and dellverv.
' Bailey brought suit for $1,200.92. The
i telegraph company claimed that the
; question was governed by the laws of
Vermont and Missouri. The supreme
court, however, takes a different view
of the situation. Tt holds that the
message was sent to Kansas and de
livered in this state. Hence the Kan
sas law applies and the case must be
tried under the laws regulating such
, action in Kansas.

If There Be a Trust Keene
Plans to Know It.
Any Further Power Needed Will
Be Asked tor.
Companies in the alleged bridge
trust must tell the state about their
contracts and must produce their
books for inspection, under a ruling of
the supreme court. The order came
today on application of A. M. Keene,
special assistant attorney general, who
demanded the books and records of
five bridge companies. The concerns
are defendants in anti-trust suits and
must answer a number of special
questions as to their operations in this
state.
The drie against the bridge com
panies today is the first decisive ac
tion in the suit which seeks to oust the
defendant companies from Kansas.
Five companies the Topeka Bridge &
Iron company, Missouri Valley Bridge
& Iron company. Canton Bridge com
pany. Kansas City Bridge company,
and Illinois Steecl Bridge company
are defendants in the anti-trust suits.
Defendant companies must within
sixty days make answer to a number
of interrogatories in the state. These
questions are contained in a 5-perial
application which Keene today filed
with the supreme court and which
was approved after a brief conference
of court justices. A II of these ques
tions are f viral concern in the bridge
trust litigation.
To Open the Books.
It is the plan of the state to open
the books of the defendant companies
and inspect their methods of doing
business. They also propose to in
vestigate correspondence, payments of
accounts and the making of contracts.
It is a sweeping plan of attack which
the state has outlined and the fight
between the state attorneys and repre
sentatives of the bridge companies is
now on in earnest.
Keene declared today that the ulti
mate purpose of the state was to look
at the books of all the companies. This
will virtually be accomplished by to
day's court order. If anything is lack
ing, a supplementary application will
be made to the court.
Questions as to the cost and con
struction of all bridges built by the
companies in this state, must be an
swered under the court's order. Plans
and specification? covering various
styles of bridges and detailed plans
covering any bridge in question must
be given to the state.
