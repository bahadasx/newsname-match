army men seemed satisfied they had
found a way out of their trouble
through the aid of a mining company
in sending a special supply train from
El Paso. This method probably can
be repeated.

as for "home consumption."

Carranza agreed permit "commer

While the Carranza permission had
strings attached and still requires ne
gotiations to make it fully operative,
officials thought there probably
would be no further hitch In view of
the arrangement for the mining com
pany to carry needed supplies.
The fact, reported by the United
Press several days ago, that Carranza
wanted to know how long and how
far the Villa hunt would go, has now
been announced officially. Author

query as a disturbing factor inas
