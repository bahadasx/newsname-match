IEfi ACE1H MOONLIGIT,
"The Face in the Moonlight."
Today's attraction at the Gem
Theatre will be the five-part William
A. Brady photoplay, "The Face in the
Moonlight," with Robert Warwick
playing the dual role of an aristo
cratic young French officer and his
villainous half-brother.
During the latter part of the reign
of Louis XVIII.. Ambrose, an aristo
crat, honestly loves Jeanne Mailloche,
a pretty peasant girl, but is compelled
to marry his cousin, Alice de Fon
tenelles, to preserve their respective
estates. Jeanne dies soon after, leav
ing a son, who is kidnapped and rais
ed by a band of ruffians. Alice's son,
receiving every advantage, is reared
as an aristocrat.
Twenty years or so later, at the
time Napoleon was in exile, the young
aristocrat, Victor by name, becomes
a captain in the king's army. His
half brother. Rabat, son of Jeanne,
has degenerated into a criminal, with
a price on his head. Strangely
enough, they look exactly alike,
though neither knows of the where
abouts of the other. In fact, Rabat
is ignorant of Victor's existence. The
young captain is told of Rabat by
his father when the latter is.on his.
ic of is engaged toLci e, te
niece of Munier, who is Victor's
father's secretary. Munier becomes
associated with the conspirators who
are seeking to place Napoleon on the
throne of France. In Munier's en
deavor to steal the funds of the con
spirators, he becomes associated }with
Rabat, the criminal.
Victor is called to the army, and
arranges with Lucile for their final
adieu at the diligence office. Being
unaware of the existence of Rabat,
Lucile believes her lover guilty of the
murder which she sees Rabat commit
at the meeting place appointed by
Victor. Rabat's face in the moonlight
almost causes Lucile to abandon all
faith in Victor.
Victor is arrested for the murder,
but before his execution, Lucile
learns the truth concerning Rabat and
forces her uncle, who has acknowl
edged his connection with the murder
committed by Rabat, to intercede.
This stays Victor's execution as a
murderer, but as Napoleon has re
turned to power, Victor is arrested as
a political prisoner, and ordered to he
shot.
Victor's release as the murderer
has caused the arrest of Rabat for
that offense. He is to be beheaded.
Both Rabat's and Victor's executions
C' cheduled for the same day.
Lucile, knowing of her uncle's part
in the actual murder, forces him to
intercede with Napoleon, thus saving
the life of Victor. Later Victor
meets Rabat, his half brother, for the
first time, and inspires him with the
necessary confidence to face his death.
Munier escapes from the country, and
with Napoleon's pardon for his po
litical offenses, Victor and Lucile are
happily married.
"The Senator."
Sunday's attraction at the Gem
will be "The Senator," a strong five
part Equitable feature. with Charles
Ross in the leading role. This no
table play scored an unqualified suc
cess at the timc of its production on
the stage sal w as recorded as one
of the most d 'erfnl dramas of the
time. On the sc-en it loses none of
its force, and tains tremendously in
pictorial and scenic value.
'&c√ΩNEL'cRO?_ WHAT WILL PEOPLE SAY
"Sealed Lips."
Ini "Sealed Lips," which is coming
to the Gem Monday, a remarkable
story is presented.
Cyril Maitland and Henry Everard,
friends since childhood, are of con
trasting temperaments, the former
hot-blooded and impracticable, the
latter cool tempered and possessed of
a sane viewpoint of things. Cyril,
studying for the priesthood, is en
gaged to Henry's sister, Marian, and
Henry, studying medicine, is engaged
to Cyril's sister, Lillian.
Cyril ruins a pretty and passionate
girl of his parish, Alma Lee, and
when a child is about to be born, her
father swears to kill the man, but
Alma conceals his name. On the night
the child is born, Alma's father is
found dead; Cyril being about
Henry's build, has worn his clothes
and witnesses see him in the woods
where the crime was committed.
Henry is convicted, and is sent to
prison, Alma declaring him to be the
father of the child. Lillian alone be
lieves him innocent. Cyril keeps si
lent, but when about to speak is held
back by his father, who thinks him
unstrung.
Cyril marries Marian, bu tbj. con
leased after t ty Years in prison,
and visits the ct edral presided over
by Cyril, who has become the great
Dean Maitland..- Cyril sees Henry in
the congregation and there is a pow
erful scene. Cyril meets his son with
a letter from Alma asking for his ed
ucation; then Alma dies, and her son,
learning his identity, renounces his
father. Marian dies, and Cyril is con
science stricken. Henry. remember
ing his old love for Cyril, writes a
letter of forgiveness to him, but
Cyril's pride is broken, and repent
ance enters his soul.
The next day, Sunday, his sermon
is at first a trite appeal for repent
ance and then a dramatic confession
of his own sins, when, falling from
the pulpit, he drops dead.
"What Will People Say?"
Mme. Petrova,. the noted emotion
al actress, who has a long list of
brilliant successes to her credit, on
both the stage and screen, will be
seen at the Grand Theatre tomorrow
in the powerful five-part photoplay,
"What Will People Say?" a picturiza
tion of the hovel of the same name
by Rupert Hughes. The story of
"What Will People Say?" is as fol
lows:
Persis Cabot, an attractive and
talented young woman, is confronted
with the problem of choosing between
the man of her heart and the man
who can give her the luxuries to
which she has been accustomed. Ow
ing to her father's financial reverses,
Persis is induced to contract a mar
riage with Willie Enslee, whose im
mense fortune makes it possible for
her to reinstate her father in his
former place in the world of finance
and society. The marriage proves a
failure.
Previously, Persis has met Harvey
Forbes, a gallant young army officer,
uhen he was returning from service
in the Philippines. They love each
other, but Persis explains her pre
dicament and Forbes goes away. Af
ter her marriage to Enslee, Persis
meets Forbes again at a reception,
and they both confess their undying
love for each other.
Soon after this, Persis discovers a
liaison of her husband with a former
mistress, ar't she decides she has
the iight to tale the love which
Forbes offers her. On the first oc
casion nf their :sing alone together,
Enslee discovers tn-m and accuses
Persia of infidelity. Forbes insists
that Persil choose between them.
Perri: irefut and Forbes leaves her
in desperation. Left alone together
Enslee becomes crased with jealouay
and stabs his wife.
A newspaper reporter gains en
trance to the E"dLee home, and after
investigating on his own account, is
"k1 to believe that F orbe:; is im
plicated in the attempted murder.
lie calls on Forbes and informs him
of his deductions. This is the first
thaut Forbes knows of the stabbing,
and he hurries back to the Enslee
home, where he informs Persis that
he is going to have her, even though
she is not willing to go with him. He
insists they are mated to each other,
and were intended for one another
ronm the beginning. Persis finally
agrees to give herself to him after
she has obtained a divorce from her
unfaithful husband. V hen the de
cree is granted, Persil and Forbes are
married, and leave to start life anew
in other surroundings.
Farrar in "Carmen" at the Grand.
An attraction of exceptional merit
and interest will be offered at the
Grand Monday, when the Paramount
Company will present Geraldine Far
rar. the world famous operatic star,
suipported hby Wallace Reid of "The
Birth of a Nation' company and a
superb Lasky cast, in a picturiza
tion of "Carmen."
Recognized as one of the greatest
actresses of her generation, Miss
Farrar's "Cal Waen" as revealed last
wvnter in the Metripolitsn Opera
House, New 1 ork city, established
Otnoted puima donna still higher in
the esteem of opera lovers. Her mar
velous characterization-an absolute
bc.e tion of power, skill and subtle
delineation--is now imperishable on
the screen.
'Thrilling action, magnliiicent ind
acapes and beautiful portraits mark
this extraordinary production. Those
who have seen Theda Bara in "Car
mei" at the Grand will be able to
judge which is the better version, and
those who have never seen or heard
"Carmen" will have an opportunity
that should not be missed. The Bara
and Fairar pictures are the only
film versions @f "Carmen," and will
not b, seen here again.

Fox Feature Tuesday.
The offering at the Grand on Tues
day will be a Fox feature, with all
the qualites of superb photography,
clever acting and magnificent settings
for which these excellent productions
are noted.
Marguerite Clark in "Still Waters."
Marguerite Clark, the dainty little
ictress who has won the hearts of the
motion-picture public by her marvel
ous artistry and her irrepressible vi
vacity, is starred in "Still Waters,"
a story of the circus and canal-boat
life, written especially for Miss Clark
by Edith Barnard Delano. This rare
combination of pastoral romance,
rural comedy and thrilling drama will
be the Paramount attraction at the
Grand next Wednesday.
Having established a reputation as
a superb comedienne and an unsur
passable coquette, Miss Clark merits
unreserved recognition as an emotion
al actress by her splendid work in the
role of Nesta, the little girl who is to
all intents and purposes a prisoner on
a canal boat, where she is kept by her
grandfather in the hope of prevent
ing her from running away t ne
a circus performer. That the
unhappy fate of Nesta's mother, and
the old man lives in mortal terror lest
the little girl should answer the same
call.
The grandfather's fears are real
ized, but not until Nesta has met and
fallen in love with a young doctor who
lives near the canal. Her unfounded
belief in the duplicity of the doctor
and the sternness of her grandfather
finally drive Nesta to run away and
oin the circus, where she soon finds
herself the prey of the brutal ring
master. The part which the doctor
plays in saving Nesta from the ring
master and the discovery of the iden
tity of the invalid Pierrette, whom
Nesta supplants in the circus, bring
the story to a thrilling and dramatic
close.

dience at the Grand next Friday,

VOTES FOR WOMEN.
Southern States Woman Suffrage
Conference.
417 Camp Street, New Orleans.
Women Curatez.
Who would have believed that Lon
don could so reverse its attitude to
ward women as to consider serious
ly the question of women curates?
Many clergymen have gone to the
trenches, and theological students
who have not already enlisted will
probably be absorbed by the compul
sion act, hence there is danger that
there will be insufficient numbers left
to fill the. pulpits. There may be
commissions to modern Marys to "go
and tell the disciples" of the resur
rection; to Philip's daughters of to
day to prophesy by the will of God;
Deborahs may lead the hosts of Is
rael and judge the people; Anna may
tell of Him who is to come and the
whole church be vitalized by Sons
and Daughters who shall prophesy,
and by handmaidens upon whom the
spirit has been poured. Equality of
opportunity is needed for women in
the church and in the government.
Only votes for women are needed to
bring about the preaching of the
church for the practice of human up
lift. Men preachers alone and men
voters alone cannot achieve the ethics
of christianity.
Mississippi Suffrage.
The Mississippi senate will re-con
sider the vote on the woman suf
frage bill. Okn third reading the bill
for equal suffrage was voted down,
but so much sentiment developed that
there will be. another opportunity gi
ven to consider the advancement of
Mississippi women. Wonder if these
women would use the ballot as in
telligently as western women? And
by the way, what makes the western
women so alert on public questions?
"The proof of the pudding is in the
eating." This maxim applies to wo
man suffrage. A woman writing
from Washington says: "The men of
the west have been so splendid in the
co-operative work. I never had been
an ardent suffragist, but I am be
ginning to see that tome vital prob
lems can never be settled until the
women help settle them."
Soldiers' Home and a Woman
Director.
Considerable discussion was raised
in North Carolina over the legality of
appointing a woman to serve on the
board of directors of the Soldiers'
Home. However, the chairman of
the board, Colonel A. H. Boyden,
used his untiring efforts and Mrs .,B
appo 4nted to the board. 'This breaks
all precedent in the state of North
Carolina. But the old soldiers are
happy, for they recognize the value of
woman's help during the war as well
as after its havoc, and Mrs. Little will
find much opportunity to add to the
comfort of the occupants of the Sol
diers' Home. Individual homes and
state homes need women's service.
The direct way to help in state affairs
is by the ballot in the hands of wo
men. Then the woman's influence
will be potent for the solution of all
problems.
BREEDING WILD FOWL.'
Local Sportsmen Co-operating with
Conservation Commission.
A phase of the excellent work be
ing done by the Conservation Com
.nission of Louisiana in the propaga
Lion of wild life is the distribution
throughout the state of Chinese ring
neck pheasants and wild ducks for
breeding purposes. The birds are
being sent from the state game farm
at Avery Island, which is under the
Eirection of E. A. Mcllhenny, and are
consigned to responsible parties who
have made application *for them and
Fltake an interest in propagating
Several pairs of these wild fowl
have been received by bird-lovers in
this vicinity, who after breeding
them in captivity until fair-sized
flocks have been ptarted will release
them on posted land, wher. they will
have an opportunity to further in
crease their numbers. The ducks are
of the green-head and black mallard
varieties, and are rapidly making
themselves at home in their new en
vironment, as are the pheasants.
This practical manifestation of con
servation on the part of the state
commission charged with the preser
vation and propagation of the game
resources of Louisiana has elicited
much favorable comment from local
sportsmen, and the outcome of -the
interesting experiment will be watch
ed with keen interest.
