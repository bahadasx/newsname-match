A Great May or and a Pigmy
.Tax Payer.
A writer in the fianner ,f last
week signing "A Tax Payer" at
tempted to criticise the remarks
made recently in the Messenger'
regarding the case in which the
courts awarded damages of one
thousand dollars to Miss Emmna
Beslin. The law is a bad one and(
we believe the judgment of the
courts wrong, as no neglect was
shown on the part of the authori
ties, and Miss Beslin was simply
the victim of an accident, just like
Mr. W. H. Cozine was the victim
of an accident in his own home
and broke his leg and Mr. D. C.
Olivier while at his work, broke a
leg that had to be amputated. The
town was as much responsible for
the accidents of Mr. Cozine and
Mr. Olivier as it was for that of
Miss Beslin, if it has to be respon
sible for unforeseen and unavoida
ble accidents
But where the tax payer saw the
greatness of the Mayor and the
smallness of himself, it is when he
attemlpte.d to redicule the greatness
of the Mayor and what he has
done on Main and a few other
streets when the thousand dollar
damage could be so well employed
on the back streets which are in
such bad condition. This syows
smallness, malice, prejudice, blind.
ness and we may add vicious stu
pidity. To the intelligence of the
entire town it sounds like the
braying of a donky who does not
know why he is making so much
noise.
Every one of this town who is
not of thei caliber of our "pigmy
tax payer" knows that the present
admlinistration has given attention
to every part of town, and we feel
sure that the "pigmy tax payer.
can't show a spot as big as himself
that has not received attention.
A woman doesn't want the last
word, she would rather keep right
on talking.

Beneficial Rain.
The rain Sunday morning was
of great benefit to the crops in

who were delayed by the dry sea
son, to prepare their lands and
Scomptlete their planting, as many
of our planters were not through
planting corn and rice. The coll
wind(l that followed the rain, how
ever, was not welcomed by the
I planters, as it was cold enough to
- use tire and overcoats.
