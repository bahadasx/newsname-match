Early in the day the race center

mayor, and while the candidates for
trustee on either side were busily
engaged in soliciting the suporl of
the voters, they yet found time to
advance the cause of the respective
heads of the tickets, witli the result
that, when the votes were counted
it was found Hint Mr. IUxey had
beaten Mr. Hammond by the slight
majoVity of three votes, while the
Citizen nominees for trustees were

IUxey Favors Publicity
of Expenditures
Vsked concerning his plans for the
lown during his administration and
to make a statement regarding his
views on the conduct of municipal
affairs the mayor-elect Thursday
granted the Newsman an interview:
, "I didn't know it was customary
for the mayor elect of Clayton to
make a declaration of principles,"
said Mr. IUxey, when asked if he
had any statement to make regard
ing his election to office, "but you
might say that I am going to stand
by tho people of Clayton and try to
uphold my belief in the rule of the
majority." v
"I believe in economy not " nig
gardliness in expenditure but effi
ciency in expenditure and I believe
in giving publicity to all expendi
ture of money made by the board
of trustees. I believe tho people
should have a voice In the expendi
ture of their money. They are en
titled to, and may have, if it is with
in my power, an accounting of the
expenditures made by the town
board, at any and all times."
"And I think the people should be
taken into the confidence of the
board in all matters calling for ex-
penditurcs for community benetlt.
I think meetings of the citizens
should decide what improvements
are needed and how much money
should bo used for such improve
ments. "I want to serve the people to the
best of my ability, and will do so,
and I believe the best way to do
this is to take the people into the
confidence of the board, as I have
said."
