PAID ALL PAST AND FUTURE DEBTS
TO
In the Future Just as in the Past He is
Paid for His Vote and Effort
by "Honors."
The G. O. P. Convention Shies at Teddy
and Herby and Slaps the Women
Smack in the Face.
"The Republican state convention at
Excelsior Springs put itself on recording that the delegates should go to
as snying at Teddy tne Noisy; slap
ping the women's suffrage movement
unmercifully In the face; showing a
decided preference for ex-President
Taft; giving Herby Hadley, the ex
Kansas governor of Missouri, a smash
in the face and sticking a big knife
through the lining of his presidential
boom balloon; and showing a decid
edly over-the-left-shoulder preference
for the colored man and brother, who
is now sadly needed for his vote pro
ducing powers, but not needed in the
distribution of the plums should such
a harvest occur. In all It was a most
remarkable gathering of the faithful,
and a windstorm of more than ordi
nary ferocity and duration.
The Faithful Fixers Were There
All of the faithful were there even
our own John Albus and the newly
elected mayor of the to-be-purified St.
Joseph. The St. Joseph delegation
went down loaded with enthusiasm
and wind and perfectly drawn resolu
tions, all of which were sadly disar
ranged after McJimsey, Swanger, Llv

seph crowd when they left were not
at all ln evidence when they straggled
in yesterday, and It Is presumed that
they collapsed in the wash, or were
blown away by the windy oratorical
ebullitions of the Ozark statesman,
McJimsey, In his "keynote" speech.
That Keynote Speech
And that "keynote" speech, on
which the keynoter McJimsey had
been so much pre-advertised. There
was not as much to It as there was
left of the Brubaker boom at the close
of the city campaign here Tuesday.
Mac was f-o much interested in trying
to boost his forlorn hope for the
empty honor of the Republican candi
dacy for governor, that he did not take
the time to mention anything else ex
cept to abuse Gov. Major and the state
zdmlnlstration. The state platform.
was a document which wasted Its en
tire words In Major abuse and empty
f "Vorredlctions of victory at the polls in
I IV;mber.
Shied at Teddy
And It was really amusing to seo
with what assiduity the convention
shied at Teddy the Noisy and his per
sonally conducted boom, and the ant
ics of Herby Hadley ln his efforts to
shove himself into the limelight and
secure an endorsement for president.
The faithful were, however, too wary

OFF AGAIN, ON AGAIN
A Little Story of the Story That Did
Not Appear In the Early
Gazette Edition
The St. Joseph Gazette the Repub-
llean News Press' echo prints a mall
edition that leaves its office prior to
rnidiilslit. On last Monday night that
edition was off again, on again, and
once mo.e. off again.
lt came about in this way and
there will be more to this story, for,
there is now an investigation on to
see who did the alleged "crooked
work" In that connection.
V. hen the Uarney Iteilly "negro'-
Mory appeared In the Republican
News-Press and its echo, the Repub-'
llcan Gazette, some one of the alleged
Republicans who did not like Marshall.

fjis statement was plauslblv written
,and taken to the Gazette for publica-

that he was very familiar with the col
ored voter. In fact the statement was
intended to be a boomerang.
All went well, and a large number of
the thousands to be printed were
run off very early in the evening in
fact, before the Democratic meetings
were over. The article occupied a
leading place under showy headlines
on the front page. By some means
! (possibly the "Republican friends"
, . .
could tell) a copy fell In Lou Gabberfs
hands and he read it at the Demo-
cratic meeting and it proved sucli a
boomerang through the assistance of
those "Republican friends" that Kdl-

the entire edition confiscated and

burned with tne exception of a few;
copies that naughty

THE MYSTERY SOLVED
The Reason Men Do Not Go
Theaters to See Short Skjrti
Is Disclosed
to
One of the best known St. Joseph
theater managers, who does not caro
to have his name mentioned for fear
that he might be mobbed, believes
that he has solved the mystery of the
decline of musical comedy. Here Is
the way he reasons:
"The new styles in women's dress,
I believe, have had a great deal to do
with it," said he. "Now, Just watch
some of the women as they pass up
and down the streets. Note the short
skirts. Observe the brilliant boots
and soft, jellow hose the woman yon
der is wearing. You will observe that
her skirt Is short.
Well, with this parade that you can
see on any street any day In the week.
and with a variety of shapes, short
cuts, and colors, with the women them
selves properly equipped in all depart
ments, why should folk pay their way
Into a theater to see the same thing
and few of them?"
