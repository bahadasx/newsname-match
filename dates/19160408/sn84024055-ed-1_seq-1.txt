rough and tumble fight Hon. George wh&rh tb Irst saw the ligfct f fiay at
F. Harding, candidate for delegate te
... ... .. t.
tne ifepubucan JNationai oonventiom
from the First Congressional District
of Illinois, was for the first timCl
elected to tne city council irom tire,
old Second Ward. The Broad Ax be
ing the only newspaper on the south
side which warmly and loyally sup
ported him at that time from start to
finish and from that time to the pres
ent he has been one of its greatest
admirers and for the past eleven years
this paper has always stood by him in
all of his political fights or contests;
The ten years that he honorably
served the people residing in the Sec
ond "Ward in the City Council, ho was
one of its hardest working members,
voting and working for the very best
measures which would be to the bene
fit of all people throughout this great
city.
Senator Harding is a true blue Chi-
cagoan for he was born in this city I
2538 Indiana Ave., and the floors on
his lovely home always Swings both
ways for his army of friends.
Senator Harding never conducts him
self in a swaggering manner for at all
times he will bestow the proper amount
of consfderation upon all those who
approach him and it makes not the
slightest difference to him whether
they are of high or low degree, rich or
poor, Black or White and that is one
reason why he is so e'xtremely popular
with all classes of his fellow citizens.
He is a graduate of Harvard Col
lege, also of the Phillips Exter of New
Hampshire and that fact alone largely
accounts for his splendid intellectual
attainments.
In conclusion it goes without saying
that on Tuesday, April 11, that Sena
tor Harding will be elected one of the
delegates to the Eepublican National
Convention from the First Congression
al District of Dlinois.

NEQEO BOY SENTENCED FOE IN
SULT TO THE FLAG.
Des Moines, Iowa. Special Because
of refusal to salute the flag, Hubert
Eaves, the Colored boy, eleven years
old, of the "Sanctified Cult" was
ousted from the public schools of the
city and sentenced to nine years in
the reformatory by District Judge C. A.
Dudley. ,
The Court suspended sentence and
paroled the boy to his parents on their
promise that ho would be placed in a
private school.
It seems that under the Laws of
Iowa, Chapter 144, Laws of the 35th
General Assembly of that state a cer
tain drill requires that all school chil
dren must salute the American flag,
Mr. and Mrs. Eaves, tho shortsighted
parents of Hubert Eaves should feel
by this time that they have fastened
a great crime or wrong upon their son
by instilling or pumping into his un
developed mind a hatred and a con
tempt for the flag of this mighty na
tion, for the next nine years except
at stated times they will greatly miss
their son from around their fireside.

SUPREME COURT DD3BARS TWO
CHICAGO LAWYERS.
Names of Miles S. Macon and Mason
Bamborough Ordered Stricken from
Rollof Attorneys.
Miles S. Macon and Mason Bambor
ough, two Chicago attorneys, were" dis
barred by the Supreme- Court of Dli
nois and their names ordered stricken
from the roll of attorneys yesterday.
The decision ended'an unsuccessful fight
of three years on the part of both at
torneys to retain their professional
standing.
Both lawyers were charged by the
Chicago Bar Association with unprofessional-
conduct. Thero were five
counts against Macon, two of which
were those of withholding money be
longing to a client. A similar charge
was preferred against Bamborough.
It will be recalled that Miles S. Ma
con, who hails from somewhere behind
the sun away down in the rotten state
of Georgia, presided at the Ben Till
man meeting the last time he spoke at
Orchestra Hall i nthis city, tho latter
part of November, in 1906, and it is
an old saying that chickens will come
home to roost.
