CITY CONTROL OF

Health Board Seeks Pasteu-.
rization and Testing .
Plant Is Necessary
Sentiment ,1s being stimulated here
for the establishment in Bridgeport
of a municipal milk station for the' in
spection, classification, pasteurization
and distribution of all milk -sold to
residents. . , . - ;, .
The necessity for such -a radical
move has alreadj-been presented to
the members of the board of health In
urgent V recommendations of Health
Ojcer Edward A. McLellan and has
received their approval.
Yesterday, Dr." A. ,C. Knapp, milk
and meat inspector -.of this city,' fol
lowing xa consultation, with the -loc;
health officer, addressed milk inspec
tion officials from four states. These
officials ,had .convened at the request
of state dairy anad food commission
er, Frank H. Stadtmueller in his of
fice at Hartford,,: that the conditions
of milk supply to and from this state
misrht be thoroughly understood and
certain remedial measures adopted,
Dr. Knapp spoke upon the neces.
sity of grading and pasteurizing milk
and dwelt at length upon the. project
of a municipal plant'-' planned for
Bridgeport, - . . ' ; '
Commenting upon tne necessity ior
ksucn a- pianc toaay j-r. iviui-iia-n, v"
fhealth officer, said: "The city should
control the milk supply-in the- same
manner that the meatsupply is now
controlled -by federal and city inspec
tion. 1 ; " -
The likelihood of : disease being
carried In milk into a city the size of
Bridgeport : is even greater than in
meats,, and a more rigid Inspection
system is necessary. I have advocated
this before the board of health for
some time and we are naw seeking a
means that will permit the erection of
municipal- plant to inspect, grade,
pasteurize and even regulate the price
and distribute the product. ..
"While the middleman will be elim
inated by this pro ject itwill riot affect
the producer.
. I think all milk coming to this city
should be centrally received and dis
tributed in an assured1 sanitary way,
after proper classification and examin
ation. Milk is more, likely to carry
contamination' than meat is and where
there are doubtful specimens taken
from any lot received the whole
should be pasteurized." Such a pro
ceeding under the present conditions
is impossible and customers have .to
pay the same price for varying grades
and qualities of milk.
"The initial cost of such a plant
would, inJEact, lesson the cost of milk
inspection to the city in the end, even
though it employed its Own distribut
ing force.' It would also insure per
fect distribution and a . regulation of
prices. The city would also be able
to receive all the milk produced and
under most sanitary conditions of pro
duction." i
