ELEVATED STUB GETS
BILL HEARSTS GOAT
The Gent Who Publishes the American and Examiner Is
Right Peeved Because Oak Park "L" Market St.
Branch Will Continue to Stand in Front
of His Building.
William Randolph Hearst as owner
of the Examiner, American and the
Hearst building at Madison and Mar
ket streets received a setback yester
day. His long scrap against Sam In
sull, public utility king of Chicago, to
oust the Oak Park "L" from the Mar
ket street stub was settled, for the
present, in favor of InsulL
Hearst has a fine piece of property
just east of the river. But on the
Market street sfile the Oak P-ark,
"L" stub shuts out light from the first
three floors of his building. With
this removed the property would in
crease in value.
He was supposed to have intended
to oust the "L" stub when he located
on the spot. Then he would have one
of the widest streets in the city to
run his Examiner and American cir
culation wagons around in.
So before his Examiner was many
months old he started a publicity
vcampaign to oust the old stub. TMny
