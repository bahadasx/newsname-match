DONNYBROOK FAIR ON.
Republicans Meet to Elect
Chairman Face T. R.Barnes-Root
Issue.
George W. Perkins, as emissary ot
Col. noosevelt, called on Gov. Whit
man this morning at the St. Itegls
Hotel, Just as tho Republican loaders
wero gathering In State headquarters
to determine whether Harnes or Whit
man shall elect tho Stato Chairman
and control tho party organization.
Mr. Perkins's visit to tho Gover
nor was nominally for tho purpose
of discussing affairs of Palisade Park
Commission, of which MrPerklns
Is Chairman, nut there was no dis
guising tho political Importance of
the meeting at this tlmo.
Gov. Whitman declined to recog
nise In any degrea the ltoosovclt or
tho Hoot Presidential candidacies.
Ho repeated with emphasis: "I am
for Hughes."
Tho newly elected Republican
State Committee which met to-day
nt noon faced complications In both
nitionnl and State issues. The com
mittee Is divided Into various groups,
with divergent views and animated
by many motives. Tho only official
business is to choose a new Stato
Chairman and minor officers, but the
doing of this has developed n polit
ical Donnybrook Fnlr.
ROOSEVELT IS THE ISSUE BE
FORE THE COMMITTEE.
Tho national Issue at stako Is Roose
velt, either as tho Presidential candi
date himself or a ftguro so dominat
ing tho party as to be able to choose
a candidate of his own liking in order
to head off Hughes.
Tho State issue at stake is control
of the party organization, either by
tho Whitman-Hughes clement or tho
Barncs-noosovelt-noot element.
Mombers of the committee have
varying views on these phases, and
no two booth to concur in all nt the
same time. The questions In contro
versy are:
NATIONAL Hoosovolt or anti
Iloosevelt. Hoot or Iloosovelt. Hoot
or Hughes. Hughes or nnti-Hughes.
ST A.TB Barnes or antt-Harnes.
Whitman or antl-Whltman. Tanner
or anti-Tanner. Now York City or
up-State, Harnes Old Guard or Whlt-
man-Aldrldgo-Hondrlclm-Ward Now
Guard.
If tho Harnes faction wins they
plan to reorganize tbc Stato Commit
too Into a close corporation. Member
ship Is to be reduced from 1150 to one
third that number by changing the
basts of representation from tho As
sembly District to tho Senate or Con
gresslonal District.
PLAN TO CHANGE BALLOT FOR
"STRAIGHT" VOTERS.
The voting ballot Is to bo so al
tered so that it will be possiblo to
vote a straight party ticket by a oln
gle cross in a circle at tho top.
Thp Old Guard may try to got
through tho Stato Committee to-day
a resolution indorsing tho can
didacy of Kllhu Hoot for tho Prcsl.
dentlal nomination. Mr. Hoot has
bean persuaded at least to poso as a
candidate, and tho whole plan, ma
tured within the last forty-eight
hours, Is regarded as an effort to
head off tho Hughes boom.
Some of tho Hughes supporters
thought they saw In tho scheme the

"Declarations gathered from pris
oners and our own observations,"
says the statement, "lead us to esti

"Uut tho German losses do not stop
there. In a modern battlo long rango

of the artillery lengthens, the zono of

suffered losses comparable with tho3a
of tho Infantry. Finally our heavy

he lonrned last night that his
