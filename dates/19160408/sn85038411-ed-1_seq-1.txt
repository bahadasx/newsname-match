Expeditionary Field Headquar
ters. South of Namiquipa. April 5,
by \eroplanc and Wireless to Co
lumbus X. M., April B.—Tltat the
American troops are on a frc>h
rail of Villa is a report made by
in army aviator and an observer
who ivturned to-day front what
may prove one of the most impor
tant si-outins iiisrhts of the eain

El Paso. Texas. April S.—The Amer
van troops have accomplished their >
object in destroying Villa's military j
power and should therefore withdraw
from Mexico without delay, was the
view expressed to-day by a well-
Known member of the Carranza gov-1
jrnment, speaking unofficially.
"The punitive force," he said, "has
done all that it could expect to do.,
It has shattered the forces of Villa,
who is now a fugitive, robbed of all
prestige and power he ever held
<mong the people. The peons may be
ur.orant but they are no fools. They
will never again respect a man who
turned tail and ran like a coward he
fore the Yankees, without even mak
ing a stand.
"Meantime, it must he admitted
that the Mexican people have behaved
well toward the American troops. They
have received them courteously. Hut
to allow them to remain in Mexico in
definitely. 20,000 men hunting for a
single bandit, who may not he caught <
in months, is another matter. To al
low them to continue their progress to
the South indefinitely is still more ser- j
ious.
"Americans would not tolerate the
of Canadian military forces
Within their borders. Similarly the
presence of Americans is beginning to
irritate the Mexican people. It looks
and feels like a surrender of sov
ereignty.
"With Villa crushed, now is the
logical time for the punitive force to
withdraw. No causes of conflict have
yet arisen and the affair has so far
turned out fortunately for both sides." !
Herr Von Jagow Laughs
at Reported Plan to
Crush United States
By Associated Press
Berlin. April 7. Via Ixmdon, April
S. Recent press dispatches have
brought word of statements in the
Canadian Parliament and Canadian
newspapers that Germany was plan
ning after this war to plunge upon the
American continent an.l particularly
demand cessation to Germany of the
.Dominion ot Canada.
In a conversation with Herr Von
Jagow, Minister of Foreign Affairs, the
Associated Press correspondent referred
to these rumors. t'he foreign Minis
ter's first reply was an outburst of
'aughter. Can one imagine a state of
affairs in Europe after the war sucn
that we should have the leisure or a
free enough hand to divert our strength
and efforts to such a task on the con
tinent?
"Equally ridiculous, though unfortu
nately this phase has a serious side,
i unu.rs which I understand here and
ihere are current in the t'nited states,
that Germany after tlie war will take
revenge on the United States hv pur
suing an anti-American police. It is
even reported to me that some appre
hensive souls in Amerii a foresee from
victorious Germany an attempt to
break down the Monroe Doctrine, plant
it * flag In South or Central America, or
even a design to leap upon the I'nited
States and crush them In order to at
tain mastery of both continents.
"I need hardly assure you such re
ports, which from time to time have
been set afloat by enemies of Germanv
in the evident intention of stirring feel'-

Philadelphia and Pittsburgh news

tails of the cotitribuUon of SI,OOO by
David B. Oliver, of Pittsburgh, to
Governor Martin G. Brumbaugh dur
ing the gubernatorial campaign, the
transaction which the Governor anU

The Governor said last night and
to-day that he stood upon his state

up, declining to answer the question |
whether it meant peace or war in the
Republican camp.
Attorney General Brown said it
meant a fight to the finish and other
men aligned with the Governor said
the same thing.
David B. Oliver last night called
upon the Governor to produce his let

"Why Don't Commissioners
Attend to Their Own
Business?" Asks Mayor
That he acted entirely within his
legal rights as mayor in designating
any alderman he wished to conduct
his police court, and that the whole
matte- was 'none of the county com
missioners business." was the cryptic
statement made to-day by Mayor K.
S. Meals In answer to the commis
sioners' inquiry as to his method of
j holding hearings.
"What business is it of the county
commissioners? Is there any ques-'
! tion of illegality about it?" demanded
the city's executive tartly. "Why
doesn't the county commissioners at
• tend to their own business? The city
of Harrisburg now contributes more
toward defraying the running ex
penses of the county than the county
does. We've turned over more
money to the city treasury than has
ever been done before. The law per- j
mits the mayor to designate whom he
pleases to hold police court. N'ow I'm
acting entirely within my rights—and
I have that on the opinion of such
jurists as Justices Fel and Mitchell
of the supreme court. President Judge j
Kunkel and Additional Law Judge Mc-
Oarrell. I asked them about this
same problem when I attended the
dinner given the Supreme Court by
Governor Stuart several years ago.
That's all I've got to say. except to
ask again why don't the county
commissioners attend to their own
business?"

Dr. J. M. J. Raunick, city health ofTi- |

j sarding public institutions in the effort j
Ito check the epidemic here. Health '
! Officer Miller, of the West Shore, re- !
| ports fifty cases of measles at Enola
I this week and eighty in all at West i
j Fairview. He threatens to make ar
-1 rests unless the quarantine laws are !
; better observed.
Dr. Raunick's statement is as fol-<
! lows:
j "During the month of March more
than 1,000 cases of measles have been
I reported to this bureau—how many
| cases not reported cannot be accu
rately estimated-.
"Since April 1 an average of 45 cases
have been reported daily, showing that I
the epidemic has not abated.
Practically All Cliiltli-cn
'Practically all of our present
measles cases are children under 10 '
.'"ears of age. Our eases arc not con
fined to any special section, but are !
widely distributed throughout the city i
"On account of the unusually severe:
j type of the disease, parents are urged
|to guard their children against ex-|
j Posure to the disease by keeping them '
| out of other people's homes and away
j from all public and crowded places. !
j "It is important for all parents to
remember in connection with our epi
i demic that measles is very highly con
j tagious and 'catchy' and especially so
when the disease is developing and a
I week or more before the rash appears
With the history of a child feeling
dull, with loss of appetite, slight fever
and cough, watery eyes and nose
measles should be suspected and the i
family physician called.
Twelve Dcntiis in Month
"As our records show that last
month twelve deaths occurred in chil
dren from measles, all cases should be
carefully guarded against such serious
after effects as pneumonia, running
ears, weak eyes, etc.
j "In order to control this situation
! a request has been made to those in
j charge of all public, parochial, private
I nnd Sunday schools, motion-picture
I shows, theaters, libraries, stores and
| all other public places where people
: congregate to exclude from all such
places all children ten years of age 1

are withdrawn and applied only to I
quarantined persons.
"From April 17 to April 22 all chil- !
! dren ten years of ago and under will I
aarain be excluded from all public
\ places and gatherings,
j "With the hearty co-operation of all
: narents and the general public under
this limited exclusion period plan as
j outlined above It is hoped to control
the present epidemic without being
compelled to consider such drastic ac- ;
tion as closing all public places in

Representatives of Various
Boating Interests Plan Early
Session For Purpose
Harrisburg's first permanent com
mittor on river sports and problems
relating to the development of the
Susquehanna "basin" was announced
to-day by George \V. Reily.
Mr. lieily was chosen to name the
committee when nearly a scorn of
canoeists and others interested hi
water sports met more than a week
asjo in the par" offices with Park Kx
pert Warren 11. Manning. City Com
missioner K. 7a. Gross and Assistant
Superintendent V. Grant Forrer.
The canoeists, the motorlioatmen.
the boat concessionaires, the rivei
ileet operators, and the boat livery
| men along the river were all repre
' sented at the session and a hundred
and one questions as to the best plam
, for development of Jhe "basin" were
; discussed.
The meeting of the river men had
been called at the suggestion of Mr
Manning who believes that the com
mittee as named should act rather as
a reference board than as nucleus for
a boat club. Information and neces
sary data relative to the organisation
( of boat clubs, the handling of carnival
. etc.. would be collected by the com
mittee for the benefit of those in
; terested in water sports.
