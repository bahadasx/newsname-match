FROM PARKER
HEADQUARTERS.
From the N. (). Times-Picayune.
Parker headquarter** gave out
the following from luttera and
telegramn:
Ville Platte, La., March . 10 , '16
Wilaon T. Peterman, New- Orleans;
Effect« of Broussard'« masterly
speech heat evidenced by résigna
tion of G. Ardoin mailed today,
H« member of the Democratic
State Central Committee for this
pariah. The apeeeh and record
quoted ahowa to (lie people eon
cluaively the depth of political 111
famy into which the Democracy
of thia state h,*a fallen under the
leadership of Ewing.
L. B LAFLEUR
Ville Platte, La, March .'50, Mil.
Wilaon T. Peterman, New Orleans:
I am eneloHing herewith a copy
ot my resignation as a member of
the Democratic Ht ate Central
Committee, a decision reached
after having decided to support
Mr. John M. Parker for governor.
G. ARDOIN.
Ville Platte, La , March 30, '10.
L. E. Thomas, New Orleans:
Having decided to support
John M. Parker for governor in
the coming general election, I
hereby tender my resignation as
a member of the Democratic
State Central Committee for the
parish of Evangeline.
Q. ARDOIN.
Lafayette, La., March 30, T 6 .
Wilson T. Peterman, New Orleans:
At the Parker meeting at Car
enero the crowd went wild at the
mention of Henator Broussard's
name. Ilts popularity has nearly
doubled, as lias Parker'« strength.
K. C. LEE.
Abbeville, March 30, 1010 .
Wilson T. Peterman, Now Orleans:
Have just read statement sign
ed by W. VV. Montagne, as ema
nating from Abbeville, in which
it is thought to minimise the of
feet of Senator Broussard's
speech in the Senate. Mr. Mon
tagne is at present a school
teacher in Bogalusa and knows
very little of political conditions
in Vermilion parish. The people
of Vermiliou have implicit faith
in Senator Broussard's state
monts and actions, ns they have
repeatedly manifested.
Am nti independent Democrat
and tn justice to the public can
not permit such statements as
Mr. Montague's to go unchalleng
ed. Whenever Bob Broussard
speaks the people of tins parish
"take notice." Ills speech in the
United States Senate will mean
several hundred more votes for
Parker in this parish and against
Mr. Pleasant, "Uncle Joe" (Sena
tor Ransdell), Col. Ewing, etc.
(The Montagne communication
was published in the Daily
States Wednesday )
ROM. P. LEBLANO.
Pine Orove, March 29, ' 10 .
Wilson T. Peterman, New Orleans:
The people are wild over the
Broussard exposure and are flock
ing to i'arker hourly. The sen.
ator's speech will greatly increase
Mr. Parker's majority in Tangipa
hoa, Livingstone and St. Ueieua
parishes.
|k JACK WATSON.
Covington, March 29, '16
When Mr. Parker addressed
the citizens of Covington, about
a week ago, there were four men
in a party who heard him and his
confreres speak. These men all
wore "Pleasant buttons" After
the meeting they wer® heard by a
prominent citizen of this towu to
remark:
"That's the man we want for
governor," whereupon each re
moved the Pleasant button from
his eoat lapel and threw it into
the gutter. The gentleman who
witnessed this is Mr. K. H.
White. On the morning follow
ing the Parker meeting three
other Pleasant buttons were
found on the floor of the hall by
the sweeper. No Parker buttons
wete found.
R. L. AUBÜRT.
Ridge, Maroh 19,1916.
Col. Pleasant, with party,
spoke here today to an andienoe
of about twenty.five men, some of
them known Parker men. I do
not think he will get even a look
in here.
A. DABOVAL.
Lafayette, March 19, '16.
At Mr. Pleasant's Youngsville
meeting the candidate in opening
said: "I suppose there are a nnm
her of Progressives among yon."
To this a man in the front row re
plied: "We are all Parker men
except the chairman and your
party .* 1 This was not denied.
Fifty or sixty men were present
and listened to Mr. Pleasant and
hit confreres, showing them every
conrtesy, bat nothing more.

SAVE OLD PAPER IS
UNCLE SAM'S PLEA.
Short ago
of Raw MntorialH
For Factories Is Told In
Circulars to Housewives.
"While householders of this
ami other cities are burning up
their daily accumulations of old
papers and rags, the paper manu
facturers of the United Htates are
being forced to turn down orders
for lack of these very raw mate
rials," said Commercial Agent E.
E. Judd, of the Bureau of For
eigu and Domestio Commerce to
day.
''Not only has the European
war foaced up the j cos of clieui
teals and dyestuffs used by the
paper trade, but lias cut ns
off from our customary son tees of
supply of large qu nties of pa
per stock. The Lotted State*
in normal years imp «rts from two
hundred to two hundred and lift y
1111 i 11011 pounds of rags, some 699,
000 tons of wood pulp, and be
tween f 1.000.000 and #5,900.999
worth of other paper stock, in
eluding obi paper, gra* ses, waste
fibers, etc.
"With the exception of wood
pulp, the European countries not
at war supply practically all of
our imports of such paper stock,
while more than a third ol our
wood pulp imports come from
Germany, Norway and Sweden
During 1915 our imports of rags
dropped to some 86,990,9(19
pounds, onr wood pulp purchas*
fell from 603 183 tons, to 511,481
tons, and our imports of other pa
per materials dropped to $2,767,
090, in spite of an increased price
per pound.
"Local paper dealers say there
lias been an increastwin the prices
of all grades «if paper f rent 30 to
40 per cent within the past few
mounts, and that even at tlies«>
increased prices the mills an
swamped with orders. Some
grades are practically utiobtaiim
ble.
"Recognizing (lie need for eon
servation of our domestic stock of
paper materials, ami the excellent
opportunity afforded by the pres
ent situation to bring home to
the people of this country the ex
tent of the present waste, Sucre
tary of Commerce William 0,
Redlield, has begun a nation widr
campaign to induce the saving of
waste paper and tags. Some
4,000 Chambers of Commerce
have been requested to assist by
gathering the names of dealers in
their cities who buy and sell this
waste, and the Post office, Tress
ury, and Commerce Departments
are co operating to give national
distribution to circulars —Ex.

Hon. John M. Parker, New Or
leans:
Permit me to congratulate you
and Mr. Edwin Broussard upon
the light, you are making iti Lou
lsiana for good government and
against boas rule, "pink ticket"
methods, etc.
I am, of course with you in this
light, heart and soul, and regret
that I cannot join yon and others
in this campaign, the success of
which means so much to our
state.
While I would deem it an honor
to take part in this campaign
which will result in your election,
I yet feel that, a congressman is
without the right to neglect the
duties of his office in order to
participate in a state campaign.

Avoyelles, all I have to say is
that I believe he will carry the
parish. I have never seen senti,
meut so strong in favor of the
••lection of any mail as at the
present time."
Dr. T. J. Perkins, who accom
pained Mr. Parker on his entire
tour through the parish, said
after arriving at Gottonport: "It
has beeu a glorious day and I am
more convinced than ever that
our candidate will sweep the par
ish and will receive a handsome
majority. Our political oppo
nents are active but I believe the
light for Parker is already won.
You may say that Avoyelles par.
i mIi will honor itself April 18 by
giving a majority for the man
who. in my opinion, will guide
the "ship of state" with a lirni
and steady hand and who will
give Hie people a sensible, bus!
ness like administration. A band
from Alexandria followed the
candidate to every speaking ap
pointaient and rendered excellent
music.
Between six hundred and seven
hundred people crowded into the
auditorium of the Gottonport
High School to hear John M.
Parker and other speakers to
night. Supporters of both candi
dates say that never in the histo
ry of the towu has there been s
more largely attended political
meeting. J. W. Bassett, one of
the speakers accompanying Mr.
Parker, could not gain admission
iuto the main body of the hall and
was forced to go around to the
rear of the building to get on the
platfonn. The aisles, entrances
and windows all were packed and
large numbers left for their
homes after they discovered that
they could not gain admission.
E. Z. Gauthier introduced the
speakers.
