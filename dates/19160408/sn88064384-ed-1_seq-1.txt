Prevent Hog Cholera.
The B. A. Thomas Hog Powder has
a record of 9.10-0cures of Hog Cholera.
If you feed your hogs as directed,
you ueed never fear hog cholera nor
any other hog disease. And the di
rections are very simple, just about
what you are doing, plus a few cents
worth of II. A. Thomas Hog Powder
in the feed twice a week.
Usually, though, Cholera gets in
before we know it. Then it requires
close attention to each hog—each hog
must be dosed—and if you will dose
them as directed, you will save better
than 90 per cent. If you don't, the
U. A. Thomas medicine costs you no
thing. We—not some distant manu
facturer— pay your money back.
