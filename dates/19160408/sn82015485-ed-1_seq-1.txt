from all quarters. Some light Kansas
steers, 1140 lbs, brought 99. 25 today,

$8.85, above 40 cents under the value

Cows and heifers are catching a more

feeders are stronger than the close
last week, some stock' steers selling

Packing since the opening of the

running behind the record of a year

is now sixty million pounds under a

MARKET REPORT
Kansas City Stock Yards, April 4,
There was another sharp reduction
in the cattle supply today as compared
with a week ago, receipts 7000 head
here, 4000 less than last Tuesday, and
he total at the five markets 14000
head, onle one-half the supply of a
week ago. In two days 29000 less
attle have been marketed at the
five markets than . same davs last
week,"" and while steer prices are :
to 35 higher as a result, the advance
is hardly as much as such a condition
might be expected to produce, and
there was nobody very crazy for
cattle today.. Heat prices-have been
raised to consumers, and this has cut
consumption materially, leaving cool
ers in packing houses with enough

Secretary Mohler, according to news
paper report, has declared the Kansas
Sunflower to be an extinct plant.
Uncle Heck observes that the Kansas
dandelion is in the same class. -
This is written on 'the 6th day of
April, and it is snowing to beat the
band. We had a similar snow' storm
21 years ago, today, and a much
'worse one April 10, 1900. Most of
our people will remember the big
snow storm'which came April 29,1903,
just a few day before T. R. made his
flying trip through western Kansas.
That storm' caught fruit trees and
yellow roses in bloom but for all that,
April snows seem to foretell prosper
