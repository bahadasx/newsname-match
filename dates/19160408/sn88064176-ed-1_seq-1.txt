Safe Medicine for Children.
"Is it safe?" is the first question to th
be considered when buying cough medi
eine for children. Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy has long been a favorite with of
mothers of young children as it con- ea
tains no opium or other narcotic, and ha.
may be given to a child as coufidently Le
as to on adult. Itis pleasant to take bu
too, which ia of great importance when a
a medicine must be given to young of
children. This remedy is most etect
nal in relievkig estgh, esldI and greoup. I
Obtof~abj r r~we -~r
es Why Constipation Injures.
The bowels are the natural sewerage
e- system of the body. When they bi
te come obstructed by constipation a part
]] of the poisonous matter which they
should carry off is absorbed into the
rs system, making you feel dull and stu
to pid, and interfering with the digestion
,e and assimilation of food. This condi
a tion is quickly relieved by Chamber
lain's Tablets. Obtainable every
where. -Adv.
