America Not
Future Hope
of Germany
Berlin, April S. Recent press dis
patches have brought word of state
ments in the Canadian parliament and
Canadian newspapers that Germany
was planning after this war to plunge
upon the American continent and par
ticularly to demand cession to Ger
many of the Dominion of Canada. In a
conversation with Herr von Jagow,
minister of foreign affairs, the Asso
ciated Press correspondent referred to
these rumors.
The fore'gn ministers' first comment
was an outburst of laughter.
"How can people invent or believe
such stories?" he asked. "To anyone
not entirely blinded by passion it is
evident beyond doubt that Germany
never pursued such senseless aims and
never contemplated doing so.
"Equally ridiculous are rumors
which I understand are current in the
United States, that Germany after the
war will take revenge on the United
States by pursuing an anti-American
policy. It is even reported to me that
some apprehensive souls in America
foresee from victorious Germany an
attempt to break down the Monroe
doctrine, plant its flag in South or Cen
tral America or even design to leap
upon the United States and crush them
in order to attain mastery of both con
tinents. "I need hardly assure you such re
ports are too absurd for denial. I
need only recall that Germany has
never placed itself in opposition to the
American principle of the Monroe doc
trine. "It is unfortunately true that dur
ing the war, when the attitude of the
Washington government at times has
been almost forced, even we think
that there might be some basis for
stories of an understanding of some
sort between Washington and the al
lies, a strong feeling of resentment and
bitterness against the United States
has sprung up among the masses in
Germany.
"Unfortunately, too, there are fool
ish persons among us who talk darkly
and foolishly of 'taking revenge' upon
the United States after the war for
that attitude, but no responsible of
ficial takes or can take 3uch a xiew.
We shall have quite enough to do at
home wthout taking on a new and
powerful enemy across the Atlantic."

Chicago, April 8. The milk war be
tween producers in the Chicago dis
trict and the distributors in Chicago,
which for the past few days had as
sumed a serious aspect with the cur
tailment of the city's supply, is prac
tically at an end today. But one of
the distributors, the Borden Condens
ed Milk company, has not signed with
the producers to buy milk at the new
price of $1.25 per hundred pounds, an
increase of 22 cents a hundred over
the old price. Local officials of the
company tentatively agreed to settle
at the price demanded by the farm
ers, but announced their action would
have to be ratified by the directors of
the company at New York before con
tracts are signed.
All of the dealers with the excep
tion of one have announced that there
will be no increase in the price of
eight cents a quart, which consum
ers now pay. It is thought the full
dally supply of between 1,500,000 and
1,750,000 quarts will be received to
day. Acting District Attorney Michael L.
Igoo has announced he will start a
federal grand Jury investigation to de
termine whether or not either the
Milk Producers' association or the
dealers have violated the Sherman

THE WAR TODAY
Around Ilaiiconrt northwest of
Verdun and between Bethincourt
and Hill "o. 265, a desperate bat
tle is still going on between the
French and liermans. The French
liaie recaptured some of the
ground taken from them by the
Germans between Hill 265 and
Bethincourt.
The Ornian assault around
Haucourt was especially violent
but (he French by the use of their
curtain of lire and rapid fire guns
were able to repel the attack and
compelled the (Germans to retreat,
lcaint: numerous dead on the
ground.
On (he caslern front the Rus
sians have succeeded in occupying
portions of (iernian trenches in the

west of the Mfuse, with the village
of Bethincourt at its sharp angle,
is being pounded on both sides by
the crown prince's troops which
succeeded in making a new dent
in the line near Ilaiiconrt village,
gaining a footing in two small
tield works between Haucourt and
Hill o. 27.
On the oilier of the salient
there also has been sharp lighting
but according to Paris today the
advantage here was with (he
French who bested their adversar
ies in grenade combats between
Bethincourt and Chattancourt.
There has been little lighting
elsewhere in the Verdun region.
An Austrian transport has been
sunk In (he Adriatic by a French
submarine, Paris announces oftic

DAMAGE IS DONE
BY HIGH WATERS
La Crosse, Wis., April 8. With
water entering basements in the
wholesale district along the river
front, where thousands of dollars
worth of merchandise is stored, flood
ing railroad tracks, roads and parks,
washing out banks on the river front
and threatening to drive dozens of
families from their homes in the
Goose Green section of North La
Crosse, the Mississippi river flood
assumed an ominous aspect in this
city today, when the high water
passed the 13 foot mark on the gov
ernment guage.
VESSELS GATHER
AT CANAL GATES
Rather Than Make Trip Aronnd the
Horn, Ships Prefer to Wait for
Opening of the Panama.
Washington, April 8. In anticipation
of the reopening of the Panama canal
on April 15 a number of vessels have
gathered at the termini, preferring to
wait even a fortnight rather than make
the longer tour arpund South America.
The members of the operating force
who have been on furlough in the
United States have all been recalled
to the isthmus.
A great accumulation of goods on
the wharves at Cristobal and Balboa
for lack of bottoms to carry it away
has obliged the Panama railroad com
pany to place an embargo on all car
goes from the United States to Europe
destined to ports on the west coaRt
south of Callao. This shortage of bot
toms is directly chargeable to the
European war, which has disrupted the
BteamBhip service and broken up their
schedules.

Secretary Lansing Formally
Contradicts Rumors in
Circulation.
IS UNDETERMINED
Not Known Officially When
Troops Will Be Brought
Out of Mexico.
Expeditionary field headquarters,
South of .Nomlquipa, April 5, (by
aeroplane and wireless to Colum
bus, '. M, April 8). That the
American troops are on a fresh
trail of Villa is a result of reports
made by an army aviator and an
observer who returned today from
what may prove one of the most
important scouting flight of the
campaign.
Washington, April 8. Recurrence
of reports that American troops were
to be withdrawn from Mexico were
led today at the state department with.
a statement by Secretary Lansing that
no such withdrawal was contemplated,
so far as he knew and at the war de
partment by publication, for the first
time, of the original order to Major
General Funston. The order follows:
"You will promptly organize an ade
quate force of military troops under
the command of Brigadier General
John J. Pershing and will direct him
to proceed promptly across the bor
der' in 'pursuit of the Mexican band
which attacked the town, of Columbus,
N. M., and the troops there on the
morning of March 9. These troops will
be withdrawn to American territory as
soon as the de facto government is
able to relieve them of this work. In
any event the work of these troops
will be regarded as finished as soon as
Villa's band or bands are known to be
broken up. -'
In carrying out these instructions
you are authorized to employ whatever 't"
guides or interpreters are necessaryiS
You are given general authority to
employ such transportation, Including
motor transportation., with necessary
civilian personnel as may be required.
"You are instructed to make all
practicable use of the aeroplanes at
San Antonio for ', observation. Tele
graph for whatever reinforcements or
material you need. Notify this office
as to force selected and expedite
movement."
No Mention Villa Made.
Publication of the order disclosed
that it made no mention of taking
"Villa dead or alive" which was de
scribed as its purpose by officials
when it was issued. It was said today,
however, that such specific wording
hardly would be included in an offic
ial order and it was pointed out that
instructions to disperse the Villa
bands cover whatever actions its exe
cution entailed.
It was noted, however, that the or
der does say the work of the American
troops would be regarded as finished
when the Villa bands are known to be
broken up and that they would be
withdrawn to American territory when
the Carranza government was able to
relieve them of the chase.
Immediate Withdrawal" Not Likely.
When questioned specifically today
as to whether a withdrawal of Amer
ican troops was planned, officials at
the state and war departments uni
formly responded that no 'immediate
withdrawal" was contemplated and
added that it was expected, of course,
that the troops would be withdrawn
some time.
Repeated declarations of Carranza
officials that, the troops should be re
moved as they had dispersed the Villa
bands and the de facto government
