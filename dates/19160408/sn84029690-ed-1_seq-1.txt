Eleanor Sickles Blender.
Eleanor Sickles Blender passed away
quietly last Thursday morning at the
home of her daughter, Mrs. H. E.
Reemsnyder. Several months ago she
recovered from a very serious illness
and it was hoped that she might com
pletely regain her health. Her recent
sickness covered only a few weeks, but j
it was of such a nature that her final
recovery was hopeless. She died at
the age of 77 years, 1 month and 6 days.
She was born in Vienna, Austria,
Feb. 14, 1839. At the age of twenty
eight she came to America, living first
at Fort Madison, Iowa. In the follow
ing year she was united in marriage to
Joseph Blender. To this union eight
children were born, seven of whom are
living. Then with her family she
moved. to York, Neb., and finally to
Ellis County, Kansas, where she resid
ed twenty-seven years.
During all these years she practiced
the virtues of a true Christian, prefer
ring quiet performance rather than
public expression of the faith. She
faithfully read her Bohemian Catholic
Bible, a tongue which she understood
from her childhood. She was of a re
tiring nature, never spoke much of her
self or of her experiences, but contem
plated all things calmly and enjoyed
them in her own soul, trusting Christ
her Saviour, even unto the end. Al
though brought up a Roman Catholic
she absorbed m6re and more of the
evangelical faith of Protestantism. In
that faith she faced her problems, in
that faith she passed on to her reward.
The funeral service was held in the
Lutheran Church and interment made
in Mount Allen cemetery.
We extend our deepest sympathy to
the bereaved family.
Doris Wedemeyer Havemann.
Hays was exceedingly shocked to
hear of the sudden death of Mrs. Doris
Havemann on last Saturday morning.
She had been apparently in good health.
Some of her family "had casually drop
ped in to see her only a few hours be
fore her death. She was cheerful as
usual, and busy with her household
work. When the crisis came she tried
to get into communication with the rest
of her family by the use of the tele
phone, but she passed away before they
could all arrive.
Doris Havemann wa3 born May 19,
1851, at Mecklenburg, Germany. On
March 6, 1873, she was married to
Frank Havemann. In the same year
they came to America, locating at
Hays, Kansas. That -was. on April 12.
She was the mother of ten children,
four of whom died in infancy. Her
own death occurred at the age of 64
years, 10 months and 12 days.
She was a Lutheran by baptism, edu
cation and confirmation. Her heart
was in her Lutheran faith as she knew
it in the fatherland, where she first
learned it, loved it and lived it.
She was essentially a home maker.
Her unselfish devotion to those she
loved was one of the choicest traits of
her character. She always considered
others before herself. Although by
nature she was the weaker vessel she
insisted on rendering the larger portion
of the service. It was her way, her
nature, her delight.
She loved nature. The little green
growing things in yard and garden re
sponded readily to her touch. Nature,
as she knew it intimately within the
confines of her own few acres, also
seemed to love her and to delight in do
ing her bidding. The flowers upon her
bier remind us of her. They are her
emblem. The ground se loved to work
in has opened to receive the seed of
another and more precious planting.
For a season her body shall rest in the
soil which she knew and loved so well.
Her dust shall some day mingle with
the dust, perhaps, in the coming catas-
trophies of nature, with the dust of her
own garden; but her dust shall some
glad day be raised, reorganized, quick
ened and glorified by the power of God,
into the likeness and image of Him who
is the "resurrection and the life."
The memorial service was held in the
Lutheran church and conducted by Rev
Wiest. The body was interred in Mount
Allen cemetery.
Our heartfelt sympathy is hereby of
fered to the afflicted family.
Mrs. C. A. Shively left Wednesday
night for a week's visit in Eastern
Kansas. She appears for a musical
number on the program of the State
Federation of Women's Clubs at To
peka, next Tuesday. Before returning
she will attend Grand Opera in Kansas
City.
F. A. Kie&e, special cereal investiga
tor for the United States government,
who has been carrying on investigations
upon the grounds of the Fort Hays ex
periment station, has discovered a har
dy durham wheat. This is something
that the government has been striving
to find for years. No durham wheat
has ever proved hardy enough to with
stand the rigors of this section of the
United States in the winter.
Peter Jorgenson, a farmer in Ellis
county, received a small package of
j seed wheat from a cousin of his in Bul-r
jgaria two seasons ago. He planted
some of it and it grew and yielded seed,
Kiene's attention was called to it anj
he experimented with it last season.
He now has a peck of the seed. One of
Jorgenson's friends in Saline -county
has a bushel of this seed. Kiene says
that the proper title for this wfcat is
"Sckrhata wheat."
Fred Iliff addeda power washing ma
chine and a gasoline engine to his laun
dry, this week. Fred is evidently alive
to the fact that in the near future Hays
will be doing business on a metropolitan
plan and that the old style of elbow
grease power will soon become obsolete.
Dean Blackmar, and Professors Cady,
Olin, and Murray, of the University of
Kansas, were in Hays, Wednesday, in
specting the work of the Normal School
and conferring with Pres. Lewis and a
committee of the faculty in regard to
reciDrocal credit relations between the
two institutions.
A. A. Wiesner is one of the general
merchants of Hays. He happened to
be drawn for jury service for the Feb
ruary term of district court in Ellis
county. It is the writer's experience
that when a merchant is drawn, he
usually feels sure that his business is so
important , that he cannot possibly
serve. If that doesn't move the judge
to excuse him, sometimes he so answers
the questions as to his qualifications
that lawyers conclude that he is bent
on evading jury duty, and after some
effort they let him go in despair if not
disgust. But Mr. Wiesner made no ex
cuse, publicly or privately. He made
no equivocal answers, but quietly quali
fied and served in case after case.
That's the type of citizenship tnat
makes for justice. J. C. Ruppenthal

Dr. ,SPARR,
SPECIALIST
WILL BE IN HAYS CITY
Thursday, April 20th
At the WINDSOR HOTEL
For One Day Only
On His Regular Monthly Visits
Hours: 9 a.m to 6 p.m.
LIVE YOUR LIFE
When a man dies before his time we
all say, "IT'S TOO BAD" yet many
people while sorrowing for their friend
neglect the little ailments that mean
an early death to themselves. The old
old story about an ounce of prevention
is as true today as ever. Catarrh now
may mean consumption later on; Piles
and Ulceration may mean cancer in a
few years; a slight Kindey trouble may
terminate in B rights Disease. The
man who goes to a Specialist today
may get well with a little treatment,
and the man who puts off until he is in
the late stages may never be well. To
which class do you belong? Are you a
procrastinator? Or do you belong to
the class who say "DO IT NOW."
Your life may depend on it.
