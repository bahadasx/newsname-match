Paris, April T,—The German losses

Berlin, April 8.—The

nounced that no
States that Germany after the war
will take revenge on the United States
by pursuing an anti-American policy.
It is even reported to me that some
apprehensive souls in America forsee
from a vlctorluos Germany an attempt
to break down the Monroe Doctrine,
plant Its flag In South or Central
America or even design to leap upon
the United States and crush them in
order to attain the mastery of both
continents. I need hardly assure you
that such reports, which from time to
time, have been sent afloat by the
enemies of Germany in the evident In
tention of stirring feeling against us,
are too absurd for denial. I need on
ly recall that Germany has never

American principle of the Monroe

Fargo, N. D., April 8.—North Da
kota's senatorial election of next No
vember, with the strong possibility
that John Burke, present treasurer of
the United States, will be the nom
inee of the democrats for the position
now occupied by United States Sena
tor Porter J. McCumber, will afford
an opportunity of testing Burke's
present political strength in 'this state,
with national Issues mingled In the
situation.
Thrice governor of the state, elect
ed on the democratic ticket in ithe
fac4 of an overwhelming republican
majority, there are enthusiastic Burke
admirers in this state who insists he
cannot be defeated. An announced
candidate now for the United States
senate, opposed only by F. 0. Hell
strowiwlth the rank and file of. the
part* favoring' Bi|#ce, ,%• tej» Mil,,be
posslble ^hen the general. election
n^xtiTfbvember Is held.',
There are democratic leaders in
North Dakota who are surprised at
'Burke's entrance Into the most com
plicated senatorial situation the state
has seen in a decade. They are not
confident that the treasurer will be
ably to rally to himself the personal
support that permitted him to win
the governorship once, over E. Y.
Sarles, and twice over C. A. Johnson,
republican nominees.-
Looking back, they point to condi
tions that governed in this state when
Burke was first elected. Sarles waa
then governor, and he was bitterly at
tacked from many points. The cry of
McKenslelsm, long voiced by a cer
tain section of the republican pairty,
was in that time sufficient to glv.e
Burke strength that cannot be rallied
now.
There was then a wide open split
within the republican, party. McKen
zie and his friends were fighting to
retain their hold on the state poli
tics the insurgents were then at the
heighth of their power, and unsuc
cessful In their state party convention
in putting their candidate across, they
bolted their party and supported
Burke.
Other elements also entered. For
instance, the Influential Grand Forks
Herald, openly took up the fight for
Burke as against Sarles, and in a cam
paign that was a stralght-away propo
sition as between the "gang" and the
"anti-gang" element, or: the Insur
gents—and they were not known by
the dignified term of "progressive*" In
those days for they really were red
blooded, red hot Insurgents, of the
first water—Burke wAs elected by a
majority of 6,115 with a total vote of
only 63,733 polled.-
Two years later. Burke was before
the people for re-election. With the
second term argument, and with the
"Insurgents" defeated In their party
primaries by the stalwart candidate,
C. A. Johnson, Burke was again, suc
cessful. this time by a majority of on
ly 2,548.
In his third candidacy for the gov
ernorship, Burke again was successful.
He was fortunate in. having as his op
ponent at that time the same candi
date he had ..defeated .two years prior
—C. A. Johnson of Minot—and his
majority was then 2,400, In a total
vote in the state of 01,500.
That, then, is the history. In figures
of Burke's three successes In North
Dakota. The present'total vote in the
state Is. estimated at approximately
100.000 to 105,000.

will carry with it support for every
candidate nominated, is generally an
ticipated—and. Mr. .Burke must over
come that proposition along with the
other obstacles that are placed in his
way.
National issues will govern the elec
tion of members of congress—particu
larly the election of a United States
senator—for it-has been declared that
the North Dakqta election may swing
control of the senate from the demo
crats to. the republicans.
War time conditions also will affect
the North Dakota election. The
democratic administration is expected
to urge the support of Burke on the
plea of supporting the administration.
Among.the. tnbiusaods: of German
ditlorts great® differing-- from those
now preValMhg^sh'ould exist when the
general election is held.
Again, Wilson's doctrine of free
trade is one that Is not generally ac
cepted by the real republicans of
North Dakota—and the republican
farmers of North Dakota are hardly
likely to stand idly by while a demo
cratic administration is backing Burke
for the United States senate.
In support of the Burke candidacy,
however, there are other important
elements. For instance, there is the
endorsement of the "progressive
democrats," an organization made-up
of democrats who are members of the
Non-partisan league. It is significant
that the'league took tio action towards
nominating a republican candidate,
thus leaving the wajr open for their
members to support Burke, as a
democrat. The Society of Equity is
also expected to support Burke.
In this respect, the league officers
were as wise as they were when they
nominated a democrat for state treas
urer—preferring to same a democrat
as against endorsing John- Steen, the
present treasurer, or of nominating a
republican candidate to oppose him.
The league selected the- "easiest way,"
and left It open for the members to
support Steen in the republican prim
aries—without endorsing him.
John Burke, with his wonderful
ability as a campaigner, will inject in
to the general' election next fall ele
ments of uncertainty that have nevei
previously prevailed in a popular
congressional election in this state.
The republican .itominee, whoever he
may be,, wtii' fac£. a formidable can
didate in the former governor—and
the issue is one that will not be de
termined ^tiil the general election day.
Instead of. being determined in the re
publican primaries, as has heretofore
been the case.

Some Facing Actual Starva
tion Because of Dep
redations.
El Paso, Tex-, April 8.—Two Amer
icans, the first to arrive here from
the interior for Beverai dayp, reached
El Paso today on a train from Chi
huahua City. They said that there
was absolute quiet in the state capi
tal when they left, but that every
where there was apparent a curious
feeling of expectancy as if it. were
sensed that important developments
were imminent.
As has been the case for a wep.k
now the whole Mexican situation
seems at a standstill pending the out
come of the negotiations between
Washington and General Carranza re
garding the use of the Mexican rail
roads by the American expeditionary
force.
Repeated intimations that the sup
ply situation had reached an acute
stage have received strong support by
the statements made' by soldiers re
turning from the front and by refer
ences in letters received here by rela
tives of the men and officers in Gen
eral Pershing's advance columns.
Adequate Clothing Needed.
The question of adequate clothing
for the American soldier appears to
be becoming as urgent as that of food.
Stories from the front of the expedi
ents adopted by the troopers to re
pair worn out garments, especially
shoes, gives sharp point to this prob
lem.
But the plight of the American sol
diers fades .Into Insignificance when
compared with the stories reaching
here through Mexican sources of the
desperate conditions prevailing among
the peons in the bandit ravaged re
gions of southern Chihuahua and
Puwn*P toward ViUa- Ur head
•rCg. -Tt 1s"s*lft~tfcafc theunfortunate,
people in the district around -Torreon,
where Canuto Cano is upholding the
cause of Villa by wholesale looting
and murder, are facing actual starva
tion. A letter which reached here
from Torreon, dated six days ago, said
in part:
"Industry is at a standstill and the
disheartened -peons in the country
districts have abandoned all efforts
to cultivate their farms. If a man
-was known to have a little grain or
beans he could be certain that a band
of bandits would pay him a visit, take
what. he had and probably hiss life as
welL General Trevlno has succeeded
in bringing some carloads of food
into the city but this relief was only
a drop in an ocean of suffering and
distress. The peons do not know
who to attribute their sufferings to,
but they are willing to join any one
who will promise them a hearty meaJ.
They have been taught that Villa is
their champion and it will be a hard
task to disabuse, their minds of that
idea.''
There Is considerable interest here
in persistent reports that General
GavJra, the Carranza commander at
Juarez, is about to be superseded. One
story, published in a. Mexican paper,
declares that General Pablo Gon
zales is on his way here from Mexico
City and that when he arrives he will
take supreme charge of all the Car
ranza soldiers in the field. There is
no way of verifying these reports, but
it is generally believed that General
Carranza is planning some changes
among his field commanders.

Expeditionary Field Headquarters, South of Namlqnlpa, April 8.—
It to believed that the American troops are on a fresh trail of Villa as
the result of reports made by army aviator observer* who have re
turned from what may prove one of the most Important scouting
flights of the campaign.
The flight, made over 80 miles of territory hitherto unexplored,
developed Information which military authorities here consider val
uable. it was the consummation of a plan which Gnicrfti Pershing
and his stall have had tinder way for several days. The reports of the
aviators showed that somewhere south of Satevo. a cavalry of column
Is making a thrilling ride, which may equal in importance tliat. under
Colonel Dodd's command. The fliers were at a height of 8,000 feet,
when tliey discovered the cavalry column to wliich they were carrying
dispatches, filing through a wooded canyon. They floated slowly down
until they were within a perspective of the troops, and then, making
sure that they were American cavalry men, landed. One of the air
men caught a grazing horse and rode to the waiting Americans five
miles away without a saddle or bridle and with only a bit of twisted
rope about its nose to guide the animal. The troops confirmed the re
ports that Villa had been wounded, but are able to offer no additional
details. The aviators also reported that the Mexicans encountered
were friendly and that reports arc current in the country that there
has been dissatisfaction among Villa's followers.
San Antonio, Teac.. April 8.—JOaerd by the apparent hopelessness
of getting permission to ship stores over the Mexican railroads from
'-•I Paso to the troops in Mexico and recognizing the Inadequacy of the
present system of supply, army pflicers at headquarters here virtually
are convinced that some alternative would have to be found. If
or tliree times the number of troops now operating in Mexico
provided, the present lino from Columbus to Satevo, some 300
could be maintained, but unless the punitive force Is increased.
officers here regarded it as imperative that a new short line be
lished.
Villa's movement to the south and east has made poorfble such
line from OJinaga. or some point near Ojinaga. From Ojlnaga, almost
opposite Presidio. Tex., there extends a trail to Chihuahua and another
from Chihuahua to Satevo. The total distance is only 170 miles. It Is
pointed/out that the use of a short line would decrease the necessity
for sending more troops into Mexico Immediately* One difficulty is
the uncertainty as to how the Carranza government would view the
new line of communication.

"You will promptly organize an adequate force of military
under the command of Brigadier-General John J. Pershing and
direct him to proceed promptly across the border In pursuit of the
Mexican band, which attacked the town of Columbus, X. M., and the
troops there on the morning or March 9. These troops will be with
drawn to American territory as soon as the de facto government of
Mexico is able to relieve them of this work. In any event the work of
these troops will be regarded as finished as soon 'as Villa's band or
bands are known to be broken up. In carrying out these instructions
you are authorized to employ whatever guides or Interpreters are ne

as may he required. You are instructed to make all pm-dr«hi«i oae

force selected and expedite the movement."
MEXICAN SAYS WITHDRAW FORCES.

iAnsIng Denies Reports.
Washington, April 8.—Recurring
reports that the Carranza government
has asked, formally or otherwise, for
the withdrawal of the American
forces from Mexico were disposed of
last night by a statement from Secre
tary Lansing. He flatly denied that
such a request had been made, formal
or by intimation or suggestion.
Mr. Lansing explained that when
the American expedition was ordered
across the border to pursue Villa
General Carranza had Inquired of the I
state department regarding the pro- 1
posed strength of the force and cam
paign plans contemplated.
Since then the de facto government
has been kept, advised constantly re
garding the progress of the chase.
Belief in some quarters that. Car
ranza had asked, or soon would ask.
how much farther into Mexico the
United States intended to send its sol
diers had been based on the belief
that Villa's trail was getting "cold."
An encouraging feature of the cam
paign yesterday was found in reports
to both state and war departments in
dicating actual co-operation between
the American and de facto govern
ment troops.
