and time and a half for over-time
is granted,
To me it a pcnr.s that the de
mands of the employes are just,
and that they hold the "Winning
hand." To prejudice the public
(lgainst the cause of the employes
the railroads are spending thous
ands of dollars weekly In furn
ishinp; press dojip to the newspa
pers for publication.
To counteract the effect of this
the railroad boys have also estab
lished a publicity bureau. HoW
5vm the employes have mi ad
vertising to let and no "editorial
mileage, to give, hence they can
be heard only thru the Socialist
and Labor press. The Kicker has
just received the Following I
Cleveland, .. April a. it ha
been repeatedly affirmed by rail
way officials that IT the demands
by t lie transportation brother
hood for an eight hoar day ivn
granted, it would coat the roads
9100,000,000 annually The four
employe' organisations Involved
have challenged this statement.
li.it the officials have never yet
presented any detailed figures to
prove how they arrived at that
exact sum. They simply make it
one hundred million and let it go
it that.
As evidence of the fact that
railway officials know it would
not mean any considerable in
crease of wages to the men. the
Missouri, Kansas & Texas Rail
way Company, in a letter ad
drcaaod to its Trainmen, Engine
men, Yardmen and Hostlers, sign
ed by W. A. Vcbb. Chief Operating
Officer states:
The feature of payment of
time and one half for overtime
would cause the railroad to
avoid all overtime payment possi
ble. Our overtime now amounts
to more than seven per cent of
the total wages of train and en
(linemen, consequently the aver
age pny of employe in that srr
vlce is io7 per cent, of what it
would be were no overtime earn
ed It is true you would earn a
minimum day' pay In some In
stance i;i two hour' less time,
than at present, bit the likely
hood of your earning in execaa of
i minim im days pay wo, :ld be
i emot ."
Tie contention in favor of an
eight hour day ha all along been
that a penalty was fixed oil
the uae of overtime the rallroa li
would see to it that there would
in little or no overtime,
The railroad officials also con
tend that it wn '.ld be hnpoaalble
to reduce the running time s
mat a division would he covered
in eight hours.
During the recent arbitration
i aae between Western Railroads
and their enjlneers and firemen
t lie railroad presented elaborate
exhibits which showed that the
average time of 7s per cent of
through or Irregular freight ser-
vtoe on ail railroad west of tin
Mississippi River in October, 1018
between terminal 11- miles
apart was 8 hour and 24 min
utes. Transportation eiLpio.w
tberefore, in almost four-fifths o
the through or irregular freight
service in the West which consti
tuted about three-fifth of all
freight train milage, the stand
aid for a days pay I Within seven
hour and so minute, it would
follow according to these sworn
statement of the railroad, that
on slightly less than half of tin
freight traffic of the West the
adoption of an 8-hour cl;,v would
require no additional labor out
lay, Additional outlay would be
necessary tor the adoption of an
8-hour day on only one-fifth of
the through freight service In the
railroad .that on slightly less
than half of the freight traffic
of the West the adoption of the
8-hour day would require no ad
ditional labor outlay Additional
outlay would, probably by neces
sary for the adoption or an eight
hour day on only one-fifth of the
through freight service in the
West. No overtime at an ad
vance of 50 per cent over regular
rotes .however, would be mid, as
the traffic would probably be sent
oer the heavy divisions in lighter
trains at a speed of 18 1-- miles
an hour. Under any change in
operating conditions which might
occur, lhe increase in the total
pay roll of the Western railroads
would be very small.
These sworn statements prove
the insiscerity of the figures now
being used by the railroad offi
cials ia an attempt to prejudice
the public against the fair and
iesonable demand for an ei.rht
hour day for train service em
ployes. In their statement issued to the
public the railways gave a list of
a dozen or so engineers and con
ductors who receive rancy pay.
These men by reason of certain
choice limited passenger runs, are
I -eld upas examples of what train
service men receive. The public is
led to believe that the pay re
ceived by tnese few men is indica
tive of the pay of the average
train service man. As a matter
of fact they are exceptional cases
and are not fair examples of
what the train service men re
ceive. The present eight hour
day movement does not embrace
the passenger train crews only
f 1 eight men; therefore, it is not
proper to use any passenger ser
vice men as illustrations of pa,
received by the men embraced in
the prevent eight hour da;,- move
ment. As the railway officials insist on
holding up these exceptional wag
es as examples of train crew pav.
it would be only fair and Just to
use the salaries anil "contribu
tion" made by the Rock Island
Railway to its officers, as fair
and typical examples of what the
officials receive on American rail
road, if the KiH-k eland I a typical

the Interstate Commerce commis

Interest :
"Following arc specific Instan

Upon the retirement of R, a.

"The contributions to officials
of t lie railway company in excess
of their salaries aggregated
about a million dollar."
From the above report of th
United states Interstate Com
merce Commission it is plain that
railroad payrolls do not always
show what the officials actual ,v
receive, There is no question as
to the railroads ability to meet
the demands of an eight hour via;,
if the funds which in the past
have been diverted from their
proper uses, are allowed to re
main in the treasuries of the rail
roads to meet the necessary ex
penditure of running railroads as
business institutions.
war is HELL"
Here is the whole of the pass
age on war attributed to Gen. W.
T. Sherman, the Inst sentence of
which has been widely quoted :
"I confess without shame that
I am tired and slek of war. Its
glory is all moonshine. Even suc
cess, tiie most brilliant, is over
dead and mangled bodies .the an
guish and lamentations of distant
families appealing to me for miss
ing sons, husbands and fathers.
It is only those who have not
lu ai d the shreaks and groans or
the wounded and lacerated that
cry aloud for more blood, more
vengance, more desolation.
"War is hell."

What Others Say
Pearson's Magazine is one of the
very few publications of the east
of national circulation that does
not wear the collar of the l'liin
derbund. Its agcs are a fair re
flection of what ail publication
would say if they were not impe
lled, Therefore 1 take from it a
little of its comments on current
events: 1
When the Phllllpplne Independ
ence bill wns tip In the Senate, the
II. m. Henry F. Llppctt, Senator
from the pocket borough of Rh id.
Island, favored us with some re
marks in which he strongl.t 1 !-
jected to the mens ire
On two grounds as nearl.v a
anyone co Id make out. First,
that the Moros wt re savages, ai.d.
second, that the Filipinoes were
not fitted for self-government
As Mr. Llppett conies from .'1
state where democracy is a no
torious farce, self-government Is
a forgotten tradition, and tl.
control of public affairs lias been
seized by a little band of w ealth.v
manufactures, where in town
elections, for Instance, the fran
chise is limited to person that
pay taxes on real estate, and at
all times Organized Wealth Is the
only authority ; you can see that
what lie said on this subject wa
hot stuff.
Nobody called Mr Llppett'x at
tention to the fact that bad as
the Moros may be. tliev do not
have any paupers among them,
nor any want, poverty nor desti
tution, There is in the Moro
country none of the slums that
cry to heaven from Mr Llppett's
own city of Providence and no
potters' field into which the bo
dies of the victims of Mr. i.ippett's
mill system are thrown promis
cuously, The Moms have 110
doomed men and women fighting
a hopeless fight against the 1 1
berculosla that si im conditions
have forced upon them; no child
ren l orn by the tho isands into a
life without hope and without J
no half-starve 1 mill operatives
toiling to make Llppett rich; and
no millionaires gorged fr im tin
misery of their Industrial serf.
When the Payne tariff 1 111 was
before the Ways and Means com
mute of the House, tills same Mr,
Llppett, not then a senator, but
only a cotton manufacturer with
feudal Instinct and a baronial
position, appeared with a cotton
goods schedule already irawu
and framed, which be coolly i
n a ndo 1 that the ec muiltteo-ad1

intact.
Some of the committee were
disposed to ask him a few quest-
Ions. Lord Llppett replied airily
that it was not true that the cot
ton goods manufacturers of New
England made great profits from
their business
"As a matte!' of fact.
1 1
"no largo fortunes have i vei been
made in this business in New Fug
land.' "What do you. call a large for
tune'.'' asked one of the commit
teemen. T tire-qua rters of a billion.' said
Lord Lippett .promtly.
Tho Committee seemed to faint
away. At last the tense silence
was broken by a committeeman
that gasped feebly :
"How how how much did you
say you would regard as a
comfortable fortune? Three
quarter of a million -or three
quarter of a billion'.'"
1 said." remarked the baron
severely, "I tho gin three-quarter
of a billio.'i was a large for
tune." " a billion?"
"Yes. sir." said Llppltt with icy
insolence.
The committee rejected his
ready-made schedule, but he took
it ovor to the late Senator Aid
rich, who put It as it stood Into
the tariff. Where it became the
law of th land and remained so
until the Underwood tariff sui-
plauted it.
The Filipinoes may not be a na
tion of Harvard graduates, but
assuredly they are a million
tiems better fitted for self-government
than any community

Mr. Arthur E. Holder, who la on
of the bot minds we have in tin
field of economic research, has
been making from census and oth
er statistics some startling de
ductions about our actual condi
tion here n th? United States
For instance, he finds that in
tSof) the average value of a
worklngman's product was si,.
084a year and his average wage
was .s47. In l'..H) till
value of a worklngman
was $8,123 a year arid
average
s product
his a ver

That is to say. in 1850 hil
ve.
was 2.'). 21 jor cent, of the value
of his product and In 1010 it was
only lti.."i7 per cent.
Also he discovers that whereas
the average per capita increase
of wages in manufacturing from
lfsM) to 1910 was 10!) per cent..
the average per capita increase
in production in manufacturing
was 193 per cent.
"These data." say s Mr. Holder,
"exjiose the true cause of panics.
How can the consumer catch up
ou production if they only get
sisteon and a half cents as a re
turn for a dollar's worth of val
