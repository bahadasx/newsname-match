prestige and power he ever held
among the people. The peons may
be ignorant, but they are not fools.
"Americans would not tolerate the
presence of Canadian military forces
within thel rborders. Similarly, the
presence of Americans is beginning
to irritate the Mexican people. It
looks and feels like a surrendor of
sovereignty."

Carl Johnson
For a Justice
Of the Peace
\Jr
0 Tlio above is a likeness of Carl B.
ii Johnson, whose formal announcement
1 as n candidate for the Republican
y nomination for Justice of the peace
in Coal district, appeared in the Dall
ly Telegram some days ago. Mr.
f Johnson was born July II, 111811, and
d Is a son of J. F. Johnson, ramlllarly
known as "Jack," who formerly lived
In Elk district and wns postmaster
for several years in the village of
Cralgmoor. "Jack," who now re.
slden In the city or Weston, has nl1
davs been an active and a loyal work
i er for the Republican party, und bla
son Curl U? emulating the oxample
. or his father, la equally zealous In his
, support of the party.
' Denied the advantage of a college
' education and finding It necogsary to
rely upon his own Initiative and resources,
Mr. Johnson came to
Jflarkshifrg In 1M8 and jgyn round
employment with the Fairmont and
it Clarksburg Traction Company. Thit
:0 he has faithfully and affluently ' responded
to every call of duty, Is very
it strongly substantiated by the fact
:s that he Is still employed by the same
ir company, now the Monongahela Valley
Traction Company, and as a reward
of merit for long ufilnterupted
service, he Is a stockholder In the
i company.
Mr. Johnson possesses all the qualifications
necessary or required of
one who could fittingly hold the otllce
of Justice of the peace. He Is a man
of judicial temperamont, which carries
with It a disposition to weigh
carefully all matters and give due
credence to every angle of a controversy.
He Is not disposed to Judge
rashly or quickly, but rather to weigh
and consider well and then formulate
Ills opinion accordingly. The more
valued of all characteristics of which
he Is possessed, and the one most essential
to one who Is called upon to
decide matters between his fellow men,
and more especially In criminal matters,
is that of giving due thought and
consideration to the side of humanity
as well as to the stern and.rigid prln
clploB of law. Thin characteristic of
'Mr. Johnson Is readily, recognized and
appreciated by those who know him
best.
.Jf favored with the nomination at
the-primary election, he will make a
strong and aggressive candidate; and
If elected he will administer the duties
of his office with fairness and Impartiality,
with honor and distinction to
himself and will reflect credit on his
party.
