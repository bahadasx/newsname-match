The citizens of the United
States, outside of military organi
zations, are evidently taking the
talk of preparedness seriously,
as reports are being received
from every section of the coun
try showing the formation of
rifle clubs, organized for the pur
pose of training citizens as
marksmen. This shows that the
spirit of American pioneers is
still in the breast of all Amer
icans and if given sufficient time,
the American nation, as a nation,
will soon be recognized as a
shooting nation, as it was in the
days prior to the Civil War.
Flagstaff Elks have taken
over the financing and proper
celebration of the nation's natal

Each and every member has

ever pulled off. As patriotism
is one of the cardinal principles
of Elkdom, the boys want every
body to show his or her patriotic
spirit by getting out and boost
ing the big show. They are to be
commended and it is hoped that
they will have one of the most
successful celebrations of the
glorious Fourth ever pulled off
in the state.
Work on the construction of

zen. Tucson has one of the finest
areas of farm land in the state
but only a few people know it.
The secret is getting out, how
ever, and the new people are
coming in. The land has been
there all the time but nobody
thought it was worth anything
for farming, not even the Tuc
son people. "And it wasn't worth
much until a few years ago when
the pumping plant became a
demonstrated success. Now all
the Tucson people are trying
to get hold of a chunk of it.
This condition is not only a big
thing for Tucson, but it is an
other demonstration of the pump
ing plant as a reclaimer.
The purchase of horses for the

considered. Ages must be from
five to eight years. The govern
ment is paying good price for all
horses accepted and the pur
chase money is paid in spot
cash. Phoenix Republican.
NEW CORNELIA.
"We expect to make money
out of mining and not merchan
dising," said M. Curley, man
ager of the New Cornelia Copper
Mining company, when asked
whether the company would es
tablish a store at New Cornelia,
says the Tucson Citizen. "We
expect to establish a store," add
ed Mr. Curley, but it will be a
cooperative store run for the
benefit of our employes and not
for profit. All earnings will be
divided among those trading at
the store in proportion to the
amount of their purchases. The
earnings will be paid to them in
cash and not in credit, as is done
in some cooperative stores.
' We are going to build a model

that they will so make better
men and women and will en
courage school work and have
provided an excellent location

here."
MAY BORROW FROM STATE.
Arizona farmers may borrow
money from the state at 6 per
cent interest provided they are
prepared to give first mortgages
on their property, accord iny to
an opinion trs nsmiUed to State
Treasurer Mitt Sims by .Attor
ney General Wiley Jones.
The attorney general holds
that farm mortgages are "safe
interest-bearing securities," and
that it is the duty of the state
treasury, when the loans have
been approved by the governor
and the secretary of state to
loan funds received from the
sale of state lands for terms of
five, ten or fifteen years. One
person cannot borrow more than
$5,000 and the loan must not
exceed one third of the apprais
ed valuation of his property.
The land on which the state
will loan money is not to be un
der $10 an acre in valuation.
Farmers have already filed
applications amounting to $50,
000 for loans under the public
land code, but as the state sale
of lands has just began, it will
be several months before any
large amount of money will be
available for this purpose Ari

The Western Union Telegraph
company announces that its of
fices are now prepared to ex
ecute small commissions such as
the purchase of flowers, candy,
fruits, cigars, books, etc., for
the occommodation of patrons at
distant points. This in effect is an
extension of the Western Union
money transfer service and re
presents the latest development
in the policy of the management
of the company to place its na
tion-wide organization at the dis
posal of its patrons.
Under the plan now in effect,
anyone who desires to arrange
for the delivery of flowers, or
gifts, or remembrances of any
kind, or for the transaction of
any other small commission in
volving the disbusement of
money at distant points, no long
er needs to know someone at the
distant point who will fill the
order or execute the commission.
All that is necessary is to wire
the amount to the Western Union
manager at the pointof delivery,
through the medium of the com
pany's regular money transfer
service, and to incorporate in
the transfer message requisite
instruction regarding the pur
chase and delivery of the articles
desired, or whatever other com
mission may be involved.
For a number of years it has
been a dream of the Engineer
ing Department of the Univer
sity of Arizona that souk: day
the University would have a
central power plant tor furnish

and power purposes. From pre
sent indications the time is not
far distant when this long
cherished wish will be a reality.
NEW RAILROAD FOLDER.
An illustrated folder, "Four
Gateways to the Pacific Coast,"
has just been issued by the pas
senger department of the South
ern Pacific company. The new
publication gives a description
of the Southern Pacific routes
through New Orleans, Ogden,
Portland and EI Paso, and the
text is set off by no less than
eighty fine engravings. A pro
minent feature of the folder, and
an innovation in this field of ad
vertising, is a graphic two color
map which shows at a glance
the scenic and other attractions
of the western country, bearing
out the slogan. "All the Pacific
Coast is a Show Place." This
map is illustrated with eighty
three inset pictures.
The new folder is attractively
printed in orange and black.
Its whole design and arrange
ment is calculated to appeal to
the tourist, and the publication
is to be given wide distribution
throughout the east.
VANADIUM DEPOSTS.
Vanadium ores do not occur in
any particular kind of rock. In
Colorado they occur in two
forms, in the vanadium mica re-
scoelite, which, in minute flakes,
impregnates a fine grained sand
stone, to which it gives a sage
green color; also in carnotite a
canary yellow hydrous potas
sium uranium vanadate, which
is also found in sandstone. At
Minas Ragras, Peru, where the
largest known deposits occur,
the vanadium is in the form of a
sulphide in an asphaltite vein.
Vanadinite occurs in large
quantities in arid and semi-arid
regions, although the vanadium
bariog sandstone has only been
found in the United States in
Colorado and Utah. Outside of
Minas Ragras no vanadium in
commercial quantities is found
in asphaltites.
It is not safe to say that vana
dium is found in any particular
kind of rock, although in any
one region it would be well to
look for vanadium under condi
tions that it is known to exist
commercially in other regions.
The largest use of vanadium is
as an alloy in steel and is quoted
at $1.25 per pound.
Jeff Milton Accidently Shot.
Jeff Milton, inspector in the
United States immigration ser
vice at Ajo, one of the pioneers
of Arizona, officer who has been
in dozens of gun fights, and
whose arm was almost shot away
by Three-Fingered Jack, a train
-robber, at Fairbank, Ariz., was
brought to Tucson last night on
a Southern Pacific train and
placed in St. Mary's hospital for
the treatment of a gun-shot
wound, this time inflicted by his
own pistol. The wound, while
painful, is not believed to be
serious, says Tuesday morning's
Tucson Star.
Milton was wounded Sunday
afternoon in theGunsight moun
tains, twenty miles southeast of
Ajo, while he and an official of
the customs service were driv
ing in a buggy. A .38 calibre
automatic pistol, which Milton
had been carrying in his pocket,
fell from the buggy seat, was
discharged, and the ball entered
the groin. His companion rush
ed to Ajo for aid and returned
with a physician and automobile.
Milton was taken to Gila Bend
in the automobile. There he was
placed on No. 102, for Tucson.
Because of the delicate condition
of the wound when Milton ar
rived at midnight, the ambul
ance was backed up to the sleep
er window and Milton was re
moved from his berth to a stret
cher in the waiting vehicle.
Chief Inspector A. E. Burnett,
of the immigration service, met
Milton at the station and accom
panied him to the hospital.
It may be a fool notiou of ours,
but we'd rather a young man
should be able to write a legible

he should be able to tell who
succeeded Henry VIII or whe
ther or not Cicero was left hand
ed or Cleopatra was cross eyed.
