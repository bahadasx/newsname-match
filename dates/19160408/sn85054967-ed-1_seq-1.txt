VILLA ELUDES CAPTURE
EL PASO, Tex., Aprii, 6.
Five hundred more Carranza
soldiers arrived in Juarez dur
ili g the night. According to
reports that reached here, eight
ca.s carrying soldiers, with
drawn from the campaign
against Francisco Villa, were
brought into the Mexican town
un» ler cover of darkness.
E 1 Paso Best Supply Base
Vs the chase for Villa length
ers E 1 Paso is the logicai supply
base for the Pershing expedi
tiv a, but there is yet no indica
tila that the Carranza govern
ili nt will yield to the request
that American troops be allowed
to utilize the Mexican railways.
Lr test reports from the south
in icate that Villa has gained on
h - American pursuers, who are
h idicapped by lack of supplies
and fresh cavalry mounts. On
W dnesday morning the bandit
cL<eftain, according to Mexican
advices, was at Souvillo, 100
n. : es southeast of Chinauhau
City.
'he same reports stated that
V : a and his small band of "gold
en ones" were riding at fui speed
oi picked horses, of which Pan
erò and his bodyguard have
noi lacked since they rejached
a ( istrict that has long favored
the Villista cause. This indica
te 'd that Villa had not been
wmnded, as Carranza generals
have confidently claimed, or
that injuries at any rate were
not severe.
lìehind Villa are said to be
traveling on jaded horses two
A aerican cavalry troops, pro
bably part of the famous Sev
ervth. The American soldiers
weve making a hard race for it,
bui carrying the odds that must
f itend when a large body of
ì o-jnted men pursue a handful
in such ragged country.

ITALIAN MILITARY CHIEF
SAYS VERDUN WONT FALL
PARIS, Aprii s—"Verdun will
never be taken. That is the sin
cere and positive opinion of
General Cadorna," said a mem
ber of the Italian generalissimo's
suite to the Udine correspond
ent of the Petit Journal. "Gen
eral Cadorna," he continued,
returns to Italy from his visit
to France full of enthusiasm
for France, for what she has
done and for what she is now
doing.
"'What we saw on the French
front is simply magnificent.
France and Great Britain have
heaped up ali along the line, in
; innumerable depots, so many
j men and such a quantity of guns
and munitions that nothing that
the Germans could now do, it
i seemed to us, could. possibly
catch the Franco-British higher
command unprepared."

Creekside, Ernest, Clymer,
Fulton Run Operations Are
Awaiting Developments.
EXPECT TO WORK SOON
The Ernest, Creekside and
Fulton Run mines of the Jeffer
son and Clearfield Coal and Iron
Co., are closed, this is due to the
men who failed to return to
work on Monday. While num
erous stories are said about dif
ferent actions taken by the com
pany, we learn from reliable
sources that the company has
taken no action whatever toward
closing down the mines. How
ever, it is true that ali day men
were laid off, according to some
who are connected with the
company, for the reason that
they were not needed, and that
as business is slack now, there
has been no effort made to oper
ate them.
It is said that men are dissat
isfied, and are undecided wheth
er to return to work until a new
scale has been made.
The Clymer branch of the
United Mine Workers of Amer
ica voted to reject last year's
scale, which expired Aprii 1, and
the mines of the Clearfield Bi
tuminous Coal Corporation at
that place have been closed since
Aprii 1.
The Buck Run locai voted to
continue work at the old scale
until Aprii 19, pending a settle
ment for work. The first of the
week it was found that the
mines were flooded to such an
extent that it was impossible to
work.
