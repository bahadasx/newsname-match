On the 28th of December, 1915, these
boys mot at the liome of their teacher,

and organized as Minute Men, adopt
ing as their motto "Stand Fast," their

Inch of the Beautiful Fell

Night.
SPUING BEATS RETREAT
Some Facts About April
Weather of Other
Years.
Part of the heaviest A^ril snow in
several years reached Fairmont last
night about 11.30 p. in. when the cold
wind that had blown steadily all day
brought rain and sleet which quickly
turned to snow. All night I nig the
snow continued and this morning
more than an inch of snowfall cov
ered the ground and it was still fall
ing the greater part of the day with
occasional flurries.
In many places In Pennsylvania as
much as six inches of* snow had fall
en at. 8 o'clock this morning. Three
inches were reported at Philadelphia
and is the record-breakins April snow
in that region.
The snowstorm seemed to cover
considerable territory as two and a
half inches of snow at Cincinnati
were reported this morning. The en
tire Ohio Valley was covered by the
storm, "Wheeling. Parkersburg and
Huntington all received a more lieavy
snowfall than Fairmont.
The signs of spring that have been
so much in evidence locally the past
few days are not to bo seen today.
Overcoats and rubber shoes have re
placed the "Palm Beach" suits and
straw hats. Baseball fans that ex
pected to see the first game of the
season today are fanning around the
gas stovfi instead of panning the um
pire from the grand stand.
The suffragists who have been
planting their yellow flowers and
"delving-in-the-rich-brown-earth" in the
great outdoor pastime of the early
spring gardening are not to be seen
today. The call of the "great-out-door
world" has no inducement to offer to
one sitting comfortably by the fire
side,, andean .hardly be heard for the
ge?ir:e purr of'"flBfcf1 fefiB lire or the gl&d
cracking of the steam radiator.?.
April of last year was the
warmest April of record for the past
25 years. Snowfall occurred in this
section on the third of the month, "but
was very light. The early part of last
April was unseasonably cold until the
19th. The lowest temperature record
ed for the month was 10 degrees and
the highest 101 degrees. This 101 was
recorded at Romney on the twenty
sixth of the month, the teraperaturo
at Fairmont on the same day being
95. This high temperaturo is the re
cord for April since 1891.
The lowest April temperature in
that time was 2 degrees above zero
and occurred in 1898.
After the present cold wave ceases
the probabilities are that the latter
part of April this year wil be warm
and pleasant. The late Easter this
year makes it fairly safe to predict
a pleasant day at that time. If Easter
should be warm and bright this sea
son it will be for the first time in
the past five years.
101 Converts At
Christian Church
The revival results last night at the
Christian church was the cause of
great rejoicing, when the number of
converts passed the one hundred
mark. Eight responded to the gospel
invitation, thus bringing the total 01
new converts to one hundred and one.
Following the preaching service Dr.
Mitchell, pastor of the church, bap
tized six persons.
A great day Is being planned for
Sunday. A special effort is being
made to make the Sunday school ses- i
sion a great occasion. The Sunday;
school will meet at 9:30 a. m. At j
10:45 a. m. Dr. Taylor will speak on j
"The Victory of Faith." At 6:30 p. m. j
the Christian Endeavor will hold a
great meeting for young people.
At 7:30 p. m. Dr. Taylor will speak
on the theme, "Baptism?What Is It?
and Who Are Eligible?" The music j
Sunday will be a fine selection of vo
cal and instrumental character.
Today Sir. and Mrs. Charles Ice, of
Walnut avenue, entertained Dr. Mit
chell and wife, and evangelistic par-1
ty, and Mr. and Mrs. W. 13. Wrick will
entertain for 6 o'clock dinner.

(Special Dispatch to West Virginian.)
CLAY, April 8.?An outpouring of
people unprecedented in Clay county
thronged the court^ house here today
to welcome Judge Ira E. Kobinson,
candidate for the Republican nomina
tion for governor. The noted Jurist was
met at the depot by an enthusiastic
crowd, headed by the Clay high school
brass band. After the princlpET ad
dress at the court house, he spoke to
the students in a body in the high
school auditorium. The Judge was
emphatic in his assertion that he
would not be controlled by Governor
Hatfield or any other man if he was
elected and repeated the declaration
that he has made from the beginning
of the campaign, that he was not a
faction candidate.
,VI do not represent.any element of

whole, united' organization," Tie de
clared.
"I want to tell you that after March
the fourth, next, Henry Drury Hat
field will not be governor of West Vir
ginia; I will." At this point he was
interrupted by a storm of applause and
shouts of "you bet your life you
will." "It is true," the Judge contin
ued. "Governor Hatfield is supporting
m.v candidacy. I am glad he is. He was
solicited to support another. But of
all the men. and there were hundreds
of them, who came to 1110 and insisted
that I become a candidate, Governor
Hatfield is the only man who never
mentioned the subject to me. It must
be obvious to you then, my friends,
that this charge, the only charge my
opponent attempts to make against
me. that I would he controlled by
Governor' Hatfield, is utterly without
foundation. While I have a great re
gard for the Governor, I would not
let him or any other living man dic
tate to me. That is a perogative of
the conscience. I am not an ox. I
never wore a yoke and I don't pro
pose to wear one now. If any man
believes I could be controlled by an
other man or by anything except by
conscientious convictions, let him
examine my official record. That will
speak for mo. If upon careful scrutiny
he can find any evidence that I bow
ed to the will of another, I shall glad
ly retire from the race.
"I do not propose to burden you,
gentlemen, with promises. If elected I
shall act as Governor Just as I did as
Judge. Promises don't mean much. It
is the fulfillment that counts. I have
never forgotten the precept laid down
by my father, who used to say 'be
short on promises, my son, but long
on execution.'"

OLD FIRST CHURCH
Presbyterian Congregation
Expected to Turn Out
in Full Force.
For the last time on the Sabbath
the congregation of the First Presby
terian church will assemble in the
old edifice tomorrow for services.} Fol
lowing the pipe organ recital to be
given on Monday evening in the
church, the work of razing the oid

prepared two special sermons for the
morning and evening and the choir

Services. An unusually large attend
ance will mark the services of the
Sabbath school and the Christian En

A tinge of sadness In leaving the
old church coupled with joyous antic
ipations of soon being housed in a
splendid new building will mingle in
the hearts of the congregaiton which
has for a period of many years wor
shipped in the present edifice.
The edifice was thought to be ade
quate when constructed to house the
congregation of this church for half
a century or more, but for years the
congregation has steadily grown until
the present place of worship has be
come entirely inadequate.
Work has been commenced on the
part of the foundation which extends
