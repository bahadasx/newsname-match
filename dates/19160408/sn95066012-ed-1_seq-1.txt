Bandit Located 55 Miles South of
U. S. CANNOT USE RAILROADS
De Facto Government Denies That It
Has Granted any Such
Permission.
El I'aso, Texas, April 7. Francisco
Villa was definitely located at La Ho
quilla tonight in a code message re
ceived here from Torreon, Mexico. La
Iioquilla is fifty-five miles southeast of
Satevo, and about an equal distance
north of Parral.
Tho message said that the bandit
had been at Santa Rosalia a couple of
days ago, and from there had turned
west to La Iioquilla. Santa Hosalla la
on the Mexican Central Railroad eigh
ty miles south east of Chihuahua City.
The news from Torreon, provided it
proves correct, gives fresli support to
the bleief that Villa's immediate ob
jective is Parral. From La Boquilla a
great gulch or ravine, known as the
Arroyo Alamo, runs directly south
toward Parral for more than twenty
miles. It is thought this arroyo that
the bandit is expected to strike toward
Parral.
The region between Satevo and Par
ral is infested with bands of Villa
brigands. American refugees from
the Benito Juarez district say that if
Villa should succeed in uniting these
bands he would have a force of 1,000
or more men and would be in position
to give the advance American troops
a hard battle before reinforcements ar
rived. Queretaro, Mexico, April 7. The
Mexican government lias not given tho
American government permission to
use Mexican railways for any purpose
whatever, said General Candido Agui-
lar, Mexican minister of loreign rela
tions, after a meeting of tho Larranza
cabinet today.
At the cabinet meeting General Car-
ranza and his advisers discussed tho
modifications suggested b ythe United
States In the recent proposals for an
agreement for crossing the lrontler be
tween the United States and Mexico
bv the armed forces of the respective
governments. The latest proposals of
tho Washington state department were
received here yesterday, having been
sent by Elesio Arredondo, Mexican
minister designate lo the United
States
General Aguilar denied stories pub
lished in the American press to the
effect the Carranza government had
given permission to the United States
army forces to use Mexican railways
for transportation of foodstufls and
supplies.
Washington, Apirl 7. General Car
ranza agreed about two weeks ago to
'commercial" use of the Mexican
Northwestern railway for shipment of
supplies destined to United States
troops in Mexico and such shipments
are being sent over the road by privute
partle!.
San Antonio, Tex., April 8. Gen
Pershing, in a delayed report to Gen.
Funston received here yesterday con
firmed previous Information that
American troops were moving south
ward from Cusihuinu hie on the trail
through Satevo, and that nil informa
Hon available at. his headquarters in
dicated that Villa was traveling in the
direction of Parral. He explained his
failure to report more frequently by
statements that tho aeroplanes on
which he had depended for communl
cation had been unable to operate sue
cessfully and that weather conditions
had interfered with transmission of
messages by field wireless. He added
that he had not been In comnuinlea
tlon with his headquarters at Colonia
Dublan for nine days. Gen Pershing
informed Gen. Funston of the exact
positions of the advanced columns and
what these units are, lint this Infor
mation was withhel1. He snid the
four privates wounded at Guerrero
were in no danger and two had almost
recovered. He did not report their
namc:
Gen, PerFhlng reported that one of
his flying scouts had located Col
Brown's column at Cusichuirnrhie on
Wednesday. It was believed In San
Antonio that by this time Col. Brown
after tho receipt of supplies which
arrived in Cuslhuirachic Wednesday
had again joined In the chnse. His
was the first column to arrive as far
south as Cuslhuirachic, but the ex
haustion of his supplies had forced
him lo halt there. Col Brown explain
ed his delay In rendering a report af
ter the engagement a few days ago at
Agnuscallentes, near Bachlnlva. by
Haying ho and his force had exhausted
their money and he had none to pay

AMERICAN ATTITUDE DENOUNCED
Member of Reichstag Says This
Country Has Become an Arsenal
and a Base for Allies.

The German Reichstag today adopt
ed the committee's resolution on sub
marine war as well as the budgets of
the imperial chancellor and the for

Berlin. (Via London April 7.) Chan
cellor von lletlimnnn llollweg's
nunciation of a modified Monroe doc
trine, in which he disclaimed any in
tention to attempt to set foot on the
American continent after the war, and
his declaration regarding the subma
rine campaign furnished texts for scv-
ral speeches in the Reichstag.
Following these orators, lr.. Spahn
devoted a considerable part, of his dis
course to consideration or American
relations. The Important passages of
bis speech, which, owing to his indis
tinct niauner ol delivery, were utterly
unintelligible at the time and available
only from the official stenographic re
port, read ns follows:
"The press and people and the Gov
ernment of America have shown by
their conduct that their sympathies
and business Instincts favor Kngland
and not Germany. America has be
come a regular arsenal and base of sup
plies on a large scale for our enemies.
The Amercan Government has bound
itself, where we were concerned, to the
formal letter of the law and has cm-
ployed regularly a more generous inter
pretation of the regulations of neutral
ity only tn favor of the states hostile
to us. Much has been permitted there
which If done by us would have been
used In America to provoke an out
break of hatred against us."
BATTLE WITH MUSKRAT
Brattleboro Professional Men Have
Thrilling Experience.
Dr. Ernest Tracy of tho Brattleboro
Retreat staff and Dr. A. L. Pettee had
strenuous battle with a muskrat on
the lnwn of tho Hooker property at
the corner of Main and High Sis., in
Brattleboro last Saturday evening aud
Dr. Tracy came near being bitten by
tho rat.
The animal was seen by the two
men as they were wending their way
from the basketball game in the Ar
mory to the Masonic temple. Dr. Tra
cy unliesitatingly picked up a rotten
ftiek and hurled It at the animal and
was promptly charged by the Infuri
ated beast, the stick not going very
near, but nevertheless irritating the
animal to the point of charging his
enemy.
Dr. Tracy aimed a kick as the ani
mal approached within reasonable
kicking distance, but. his aim was poor
and he slipped besides missing. There
was a mad scramble by the two men
one to get up and the other to aid him
to arise and they finally escaped, leav
ing the muskrat temporarily in com
mand of the field. A few minutes
later a man who was wearing heavy
rubber boots demonstrated that his
aim with his feet was better than that
of the physician and he hoisted the
animal so high that when it came
down It was lifeless. A small bov
was presented the prize.

Germans Determined to Break
Through West of the Meuse
MADE TWO SEVERE ASSAULTS
Beth Attacks Begun After Nightfall
and Preceded by Terrific
Bombardments.
Loudon, April 7. A gigantic squeez
ing operation has beeii begun by the
German forces on the west cf the
Meuse in an attempt to break into the
Avocourt-Bcthineourt snlient from
both east aud west, and force the
French troops, holding that area, to
withdraw southward.
French ollicial reports today give the
only information' concerning two se
vere assaults made by the Crown
Prince's troops on the salient last
night and today.
The lirst attack, and apparently the
most severe, was tlin-cteu at the east
ern side of the French wedge, between
the heavily fortified village of Hethin
court and Hill 2i3 to the southeast.
s has been the case with most of the
successful German attacks lately, this
one was started under cover cf dark
ness, following a very severe artillery
bombardment.
The German Infantry penetrated
the first line of French trenches at a
point on the liethlncouit-Chattancourt
highway. A counterattack was begun
immediately, and, according to the
rench account, won back all of the
lost, ground except on a front of 300
yards. Today the French troops re
sumed the fighting there, and by a
hand grenade atacks drove the Ger
mans from other portions of the
trenches .
The other assault by the Germans
on the salieut was directed on the
west lroni around the village of Hau-
court, which was wrested from the
"rendi during Wednesday night. An
advance was made on a front of a mile
and a quarter, but after some stiff
fighting the Germans were compelled
to retire.

Lord Cecil Answers- Fei'hstag
Speech of Imperial Chancellor
ESPONSIBILITY NOT ENGLAND'S
Declares No Utterance of Bethmanrr-
Hollweg Can Form the Basis of
Peace Negotiations
London, April 8. Lord Robert Cecil,
British minister of war trade, made a
sharp reply last night to the speech
in the Reichtag of Dr. von Bethinaun-
Hollweg, the flerman imperial chan
cellor. Conversing with American
correspondents on behalf, of the for-
ign office. Lord Robert said the sug
gestion that Germany might aban
don her submarine warfare if Great
Britain relaxed her food blockade was
hardlv likely to be entertained by
Ireut Britain, which had no faith that
any promise made by Germany regard
ing submarine warfare would be kept
Germany slackened her submarine
warfare for some time when the oper
ations of the British navy deprived her
of the necessary number of subma
rlncs," said Lord Robert, "but has now
begun it again. I am convinced thai
Germany cannot be trusted to keep
my promise." j.
Reviewing the address of Dr. von
Bethmann-llollweg, Lord Robert said:
The chancellor's speech covers much
of old ground. As usual, he claims
that the allies have no legal right tc
blockade Germany and appears tc
think the neutrals are of the same
opinion. Yet among all the neutral
governments who have protested
iigainst our action, none has been
found to argue that the blockade Is ir
itself illegal precisely in the propor
tion In which it Is effective. That is
'.crmany's contention. Germany has
openly proclaimed her Intention ol
blockading this country, and has dom
her best to do so. We presume her
action is justified because it is inef
fective."
Referring to Dr. von Bethmann-
llollweg's statement tnat Great
Britain alone is responsible for the
ontiuuation of the war and thnt h(
made proposals last September t(
which he had received no reply, Lord
Robert said: "II may tie well to make
a clear answer to this. By singling
out separate powers among the allies
the chancellor endeavors to sow mis
hief and distrust among them, but he
has failed. The allies stand together
and have pledged themselves to make
peace In common. The chancellor
knows this well. He knows, too, and
the people of Germany who he de
ludes should know, that nothing ir
any public speech he makes can ever
form the basis of peace overtures.
'These periodical speeches In the
Reichstag are cunning blends of bom
bast nnd peaceful protestations
Through them nil runs the deliberate
design to nourish German hatred o'
Lngland above all her allies and
bolster the fiction that the German
government are fighting a defensive
war. aud to forestall and prevent that
which the German government most
fears a popular demand in Germany
for peace. Never can the allies dignify
this attitude by taking it as an over
ture. The chancellor made his so
culled proposals last year solely that
he might be able to refer to them
virtuously today.''
Lord Robert, recalled Dr. von Beth
maiui-llollweg's words of December
'.) "None of our enemies has ap
proached with peace, proposals and
they believe it to be in their interest
falsely to attribute peace proposals to
us." and the chancellor's statement
that if he was to speak of peace con
ditions he must first, see the condi
tions of Germany's enemies.
"It is clear," Lord Robert, continued,
that the Germans themselves did not
make any proposals in spite of what
the chancellor now pretends. Even if
he were sincere, and in the precise
proportion as we believe him sincere
wp reject with indignation and con
tempt the basis of pence he offers.

High School Girls' Basketball Five
Won Season's Last Game
LOST ONE GAME IN SEASON
First Year of Basketball for Girls
In Beninngton Has Been
Brilliant Success.
The Bennington High school girls
closed their basketball schedule last
evening with a victory of 9-8 over
their rivals of long standing, the girls
of Drtuy high school In North Adams.
The game was the fastest as well as
the closest during the winter, each
side peering alternately. At the end
of tho lirst. half, the score stood 4 to 4
and uii to the last minute of the last
half, tho score was tied at 8-8. In the
last minute of play, Drury fouled and
Margaret Nash made the free throw
for Bennington. Very few fouls were
called on either side with the ex
ception of several for overguarding.
The best feature of the game was
the superior pass work of the Drury
jir'.s but they were so closely and ef-
.'e'tively guarded by the Bennington
girls that they were unable to score.
Mr. Mabrey accompanied the team
with a number of the high school boys
as well to cheer the girls on to vic
tory. The line up and summary fol-

This victory makest he sixth out
of the eight gamei played, one game
icing tied with Dalton, and one game
lost to Bur rand Burton by one point,
only. As this is the first year in
.vhich any real practise has been pos
sible lor girls in Bennington, this rec
ord is considered a very good one.
Margaret Nash as captain ot the
team has perhaps been the most spec-
iicular player, although the good
record is due mostly to tho faithful
md Inconspicuous work of the entire
team, together, especially the guards
Julia Brazil ranks second in aggres
siveness and percision as a forward.
A great deal of credit Is due also
to the substitutes who came faithfully
to practise but did not have an oppor
tun it y to play very often. Surely, the
reason, as a whole, has been most
worth-while from the view points of
spectators, school authorities and
the community in general, and a pre
cedent has been established for bas
ketball as a wholesome sport for girls.
It Is hoped that next year more girls
will decide to try out lor the team
md give their support at practise. The
