CHANCE AT MOVIES
The big rabbit drive at Lorella Is
to start promptly at 2 o'clock Sunday
Instead of an earlier hour as at first
' planned, according to .the statement
of Wm. Fordney, who was in the xlty
from Lorella yesterday.
i The change In the hour was made
, to enable the photographer to secure
better pictures. During the forenoon
tho position of the sun was such that
It would shine directly In the face of
tho camera. This later date will also
permit more people to attend from
, Klamath Falls and other points at a
distance.
Owners of four or five machines
from here have already stated that
they were going to the drive and
many of the candidates will also at
tend, 'as this is expected to be one
of the largest gatherings ever held In
the upper country.

No Excuse for Any Delay In Ex
plaining Mutter Question of Sev
erance of Relationships Depends on
' the Contents of Germany' Prelim-
inary Reply
By CARL ACKERMAN
i (United Press Staff Correspondent)
I BERLIN, April 8. It Is uncondi
tionally stated that If a German sub-
marine attacked tlio steamer Sussex,
,the commander violated Instructions.
The vessel was a passenger ferry, and
thus protected under German assur-
nnces to America.
The other four cases mentioned
niiereln American lives were Jeopard-
J ized are held to have been freighting
vessels, which Germany was not
pledged to warn before torpedoing.
United Press Service
WASHINGTON, D. C, April 8.
Authorities hold that If Germany
claimed that the commander of the
submarine attacking the Sussex vio
lated Instructions, this Is no excuse,
especially In view of the necessity of
America having to ask an explanation
before this was offered.
The administration is awaiting Ger-
minya. preliminary reply. It to b
iievea mat tne matter of peace or
severance of relations depends upon
this. ' N
President Wilson cut short a week
end trip on the Mayflower this after
noon. This Is believed to mean that
Germany's reply will be received by
tonight.
WEEKS BUYS STOCK OF
LOCAL ELECTRIC STORE
A deal was completed today where
by Cecil Weeks becomes the owner
of the electric stock and department
of the Sportsmen's Equipment com
pany. Weeks has bad three years'
experience as an electrician here, be
sides long service in the East, and he
will give the work his personal at
tention, leaving his hide, wool and
fur business in the hands of an ex
perienced man.
BRITONS ALSO

TOMMY ATKINS FOLLOWS EX-
AMPLE OF HIS FRENCH ALLY,
AND THUS CUTS DOWN HEAD
INJURIES
United Press Service
LONDON, April 8. The English
troops on the western front are com
ing to tho steel helmet, as well as the
French.
The new headgear had its first good
trial in the recent fighting at the bluff
north of the Ypres-Cofimlnes canal.
It proved a great success. In many
cases the helmets were hit and dented
by pieces of shrapnel which did not
even wound the men under them. In
others the wearers suffered nothing
worse than the equivalent of a stiff
wallop with a club.
The English vary somewhat from
the French helmets. They are ot
Bteel, painted gray, something like In
verted bowls in appearance, and far
from ornamental. They furnish effi
cient protection, however, for the
head and neck. The soldiers call
them "soup plates,"
Their serviceability has given rise
to much unofficial talk eoieeralag the
wisdom of clothing the aaea In breast
and hack plates for treneh Ighttag
and charges.

BERLIN, April 8. The Germans

er Braunton and a small schooner
from Clyde were blown up yesterday.
The crews were all saved.
