Detroit manufacturer who financed
and led the peace expedition which

he arrived In New York yesterday on
the steamer Bergensfjord.

Mr. Ford confirmed cable reports
that his leaving the party he organ
ised had been hastened by illness, but
declared his return had been hastened
only a few days as he had Intended
when he left, to return within the
month.
"The movement la now organised
and under way." Mr. Ford said. Peo
ple are talking about It and. while
some criticise, when people talk they
think and when they think they think
right.
"I am simply financing and carrying
out

all good men.

Copenhagen. Jan. I.—The German
government has granted the Ford
peace expedition permission to travel
to The Hague through Germany by
special train.
The party will leave Copenhaven
next Friday. Final arrangements for
the trip will be made through the
Qennan consulate at Copenhagen, who
after a consultation with Berlin, an
nounced that the government is will
ing for the mission to proceed through

Against Preparedness.
None of his experiences in Europe
tended
to change Mr. Ford's previous
\y announced attitude toward Presi
dent Wilson's preparedness plans.
"I am against preparedness, as pre
paredness means war," declared the
pacificist. "No man will arm himself
unless be means to attack. Even
when he takes a fork In hand, he Is
preparing to attack an oyster or a
She#r stew. I would be better for-the
administration to find out first if the
people want armament. If they do,
they will eventually get what Europe
is getting now."
•r'
content to
those who rule them
do:
f-
their
thinking, and they have not taken
ad­
vantage of their divine right to say
for
themselves what they shall do and
think, the pacificist asserted.
"Republics are nobler than mon
archies in this respect," he said.
"Even in the United States we let
those whom we have elected to oflUce
be swerved from their duty. We do
not assert ourselves. Personally, I
have been a voter thirty-one years
and in all that time I have voted only
six times, and then because my wife
made me."
Mr. Ford's future plana with re
spect to the peace expedition were un
certain. he said. While. he had sev
eral ideas in mind, he deemed it too
urly to speak of them. He left the
party In charge of Oaston Plan tiff, he
stated. In accordance with his original
plans and, despite all reports to the
ontrary, when the party left the Os
car II it was as harmonious as could
le desired.
To Crystallise Ideas.
"The
main idea of the mission,"
continued Mr. Ford, "was to crystal

GRAND FORKS, N. D„ MONDAY EVENING, JANUARY 3, 1916.
Russians Hurling Blows at
Opposing Forces Accord
ing to Accounts.
OBSERVERS ARE
SPECULATING!
Attitude of Rumania Con
tinues to Grow in
Importance,
London, Jan. 3.—-Russia's campaign
in Bessarabia continues to be the
most important visible war activity.
From the Pripet to the Rumanian
frontier over a front of at least 300
miles, a huge Russian force with a
great appearance of confidence is
hurling sledge hammer blows at the
opposing force which, according
to
accounts, totals at least
Obtfetyertt
ginning of hostilities,,
all
one
and a
half millions of men.
Petrograd still claims considerable
successes in the early stages of the
campaign and dispatches emphasizing
the excellent equipment supplies and
munitions that Russia laid up for f.hia
purpose during a period of compara
tive inactivity.
Speculate.
Some Ixmon observers, speculat

AttitMeis of Importance.
So long as Russia keeps up her
present activity just north of the Ru
manian border the attitude of Ru
mania will continue to grow in im
portance. There have been many as
sertions in the entente capitals that
Rumania was about to enter the war
on the side of the entente allies, but
nothing to support this has yet been
heard from credible Rumanian sour,
ces. Meanwhile in the south of the
Balkan peninsula the entente allies
continue their expectant attitude to
ward a threatened attack, although
Greece seems mainly occupied in mak
ing various diplomatic protests, hav
ing followed up her polite protest to
the entente allies against the arrest of
the consuls, by an equally public re
quest to the central powers against
their aeroplanes flying across Greek
territory which killed a Greek shep
herd and a few sheep.
The sinking of the steamship Per
sia with the death of an American
consular officer brings up in the Euro
pean capitals the familiar query as to
what the United States will do now.
Dispatches from Egjpt correspondents
picture the sinking of the Persia as a
particularly aggravated case, owing to
the fact that the ship was not only
hit without warning or opportunity
for the passengers tb escape, but wus
also hU in a most fltal part, so that
she sank almost 1 Immediately, the
whole time from tke striking of the

JUSTICE LAMAR
PASSED SUNDAY
Joseph Rucker I/amar.
Washington, Jan. S.—Joseph Ruck
er Lamar, associate Justice of the su
preme court of the United States, died
at his home here last night, after an
Illness of several months. ITe was
68 years old, and had been on the
supreme bench for five years.
TWO MOTIVES
FOR MURDERS
Most Generally Accepted
t-
Proceeds of load of Flax, iPIans
8'
triple murder and Hall's suicide.
One of these was Mrs. Hart's de
nial of Hall's continued friendship
with Mrs. Hart's eldest daughter,
which friendship was forbidden by the
mother because of Hall's addiction to
liquor.
Another possible clue is found in
the fact that Hall had several days
previous to the murder hauled a load
of flax to market, selling the same and
pocketing the proceeds.
The coroner's investigation into the
triple murder and suicide leads him
to believe that Hall first killed the
boys, and then killed the mother.
That the boys were slain while mak
ing inquiry with reference to the pro
ceeds for the load of flax, is the gen
erally accepted theory.
Hall's threat against the life of
Grace McFarland, a niece of Mrs.
Hart, which was uttered at Mrs. Mc
Farland's home in Ray. immediately
preceded his suicide, the arrival of
George McFarland preventing his ful
fillment of the threat.
Officials have inquired, so far with
out result, of officials in Washington,
Hall maintaining that he was an es
caped Inmate of the Washington state
reformatory. No word has come from
relatives either, inquiry In Seattle,
where Hall said he lived, being vain.

they probably explain the plan for censorship in time of war
ii
the
worked out by the army general siaff
was revealed In the annual report of
Major General Hugh L. Scott, chief
of staff, made public last night. The
report says it is of vital Importance
that definite preparation along this
line be made before war Is at hand
or, "we may anticipate greater con
fusion and dissatisfaction than Great
Britain experienced if no plans be pre
pared and no personnel be selected
for execution thereof until the time
arrives when censorship and control
of the press become as necessary as
in Europe in 1914."
The following is quoted from the
staff plan:
Consult Press Men.
"That of an officer of the army des
ignated by the secretary of war and
an officer of the navy designated by
the secretary of the navy be directed
to consult with representatives of the
press associations and managers of
the leading newspapers of the coun
try in drafting legislation authorizing
the president to issue regulation for
the control of publication and censor
ship of telegraph, cable, wireless and
mail communications wherever such
course may see to him necessary for
the defense of the country.
"That such, draft, after approval by
the judge advocate general of the
army, be either submitted to congress
at once or held ready to submit when
conditions seems to warrant favorable
action, as the president may deem
proper.
"That whether or not such draft he
now submitted, regulations to render
an effective censorship be drawn up
and careful plans prepared for execu
tion of the censorship under such
regulations. These should include rec
ord of each cable, wireless and tele
graph station which would require
supervision by censor lists of all
newspapers, periodicals and corre
spondents, selection of army and navy
officers, preferably retired, and of ex
perienced newspaper men as person
nel of the censorate. Following the
British plan, the assistant secretary
of war could wpII be assigned as di
rector of the censorate.
"In time of national peril and ab
sence of legation, the president should
at once direct a censorship of all
communication by mail, cable, wire
or wireless: if necessary declaring
martial law to an extent necessary to
effect arbitrary suppression of print
ing or communication of matter that
might prove detrimental to national
defense or useful to a possible ene
my."
The plan is now under discussion,
it is understood by officials of the war,
navy and state departments.

CAPITAL ASSURANCES BY AUSTRIA ARC
FOLLOWED BYJEW SEA OUTRAGES
Washington, Jan. AfUr Secretary Tumulty had telephoned to
President Wilson at Hot Springs, it is said at the Wliitc House that the
president Is preparing to return, probably tomorrow, to take charge of
the International situation.
It is .stated authoritatively that the destruction of the Persia, with
the loss of American life, and destruction of the British ship Glengyle.
has put such a grave aspect on the relations of the United States with
Teutonic powers that the president considered it necessary to return to
the White House immediately for conferences with Secretary Lansing
and other members of the cabinet to sliapc the course of the govern
ment.
The situation, as its exists, is described in official quarters as par
aueling the crisis which was caused by the sinking of the Arable close
to Germany's assurance, in response to representations to the United
States on the destruction of the Lusitauia.
During the morning Baron Zwiedinek. charge of the Austrian em
bassy. called on Secretary Lansing and asked that judgment be with
held untill all facts are known, expressing his belief that the final er
plnnatlon would be satisfactory. He also sought available lnforma
lion for his government. Baron Zwiedinek also assured Lansing that
if it proved than an Austrian submarine had sunk the Persia, his gov
ernment would give full reparation and satisfaction.
Lansing announced he hud instructed Ambassador PenAeld at VI-
^,,striai1 government for any information which might
establish the nationality of the submarine which is said to have sunk
the Persia, and which would help develop the facts in the While
American officials are keeping their minds open until they have all the
farts in the Persia case, and officially know whether Americans were
endangered In the sinking of the Glengylc. the gravity of the situation
Is not minimized, and the declaration of Baron Zwiedinek, Austrian
charge, has not lessened the tension.
.. ,Officials consider that tlic Austrian submarine campaign in the
Mediterranean has brought on just such a crisis as did the German sub
marine campaign in the declared war wne around the British Isles
Coming close on conciliatory assurance in Austria's Aneona note,
continued submarine activity, princiiwlly around the entrance to the
Suez canal, has amazed American officials, who have grave anorehen
