President Wilson Starts For Washington In Special Train
No Lives Lost On Glenjjyle, P- Its Being Torpedoed
Indicates Austria Is Deliberi Showing Contempt
: for America-Situation Is Ten ind May Result In
Severing of Relations doYen t Will Be Forced
to Take This Course
Washington, Jan. S. The gravity the international
situation caused by torpedoing of the British liner Glen
gyle, coming on the heels of the sinking of the liner
Persia, caused President Wilson today to determine to cut
his vacation short and return here, arriving tomorrow
morning.
The Southern railway took immediate steps to fetch
him quickly here and at once set to work to send his
private car to Hot Springs. He should be in the capital
early tomorrow, according to present plans.
Meantime, official circles awaited details of both the
Persia and Glengyle sinkings with most anxious fore
bodings. Their worst fears were realized in the death of
American Consul McNeely of Adam and the reports that
the torpedoing was without warning, as required by inter
national and humane law.
While it was reported that the president will call a
cabinet session immediately upon his return, the state de
partment showed the real gravity of the situation when it
said, "no effort should be made to minimize the serious
ness of the situation." Moreover, it was intimated that an
understanding with all the central allies as to submarine
attacks will be demanded immediately.
Gun Not An Excuse. '.
The presence- of a 4.7 inch -gun on
t'-ie Persia, m reported by Consul Gar
rets At' Alexandria, together witii the
fact that" there Wore 25 British ottieer
en route to. Egypt aboard was regarded
as of minor importance inasmuch as
the administration recognizes the right
of nit . ihantmen to parry small guns for
defense. The soldiers among the pas
sengers, it was held, could not give the
vessel the status of a "troop ship," li
able to attack without warning.
Later a special train was rushed to
Kot Spring, Vo., to bring President
Wilson back to Washington. He may
arrive before tomorrow morning.
The state department expected that
Austria or Germany which ever own
ed the attacking the submarine would
anticipate a protest or ultimatum from
America, and hence would voluntarily
disavow the torpedoing of the Persia.
The situation seemed the more serious
from the fact that tho Persia incident,
followed so closely upon Austria' re
assuring note in the Ancona case; and
flint the Fersia sinking was in turn suc
ceeded by the Glengyle torpedoing.
Was It Mine Or Submarine . '
Ilefore any action can be taken, how
ever, the administration must first set
tle whether n submarine or a mine was
responsible fur the Persia sinking, and,
if it was a submarine, what its nation
nlity wns.
The state department is determined
to obtain fiouv the rentrnl powers a
binding prninUe that ill future submn
ri no nt tacks, the safety of non-combatants
not only on liners but on mer
chantmen shall be assured. One result
of this position will be n showdown in
tlio I.imtnnia cue, inasmuch a Ger
many's pledges in this incident have
thus far extended only to liners.

he asserted, no one knows wuotnor
there was justification. ' In any event,
he suggested that Austria through her
Ancona reply indicated her readiness
to do right. He expressed himself as
confident and hopeful that, if the sub
marine proved to be Austrian, his gov
ernment would take immediate step
toward n satisfactory settlement. .
No Official Information,
In this connection, officials suggest
ed that possibly the contents of the
Austrian note, and instructions to sub
marines, contingent thereon had not
reached the submarine commander who
sank the Persia; if indeed, it was an
Austrian diver.
Charge d' Affaires Zwiedinek called
at Secretary of State Lansing's office
at noon anil spent some time there.
An hour previous, Presidential Sec
retary Tumulty visited the premier to
learn' news of the Persia and Glengyle,
but was told thai no official informa
tion concerning '' vHengyle had been
received.
Prom some quarters came a demnud
for tho immediate recall of German
Ambnssador Von llernstorff and Baron
Zwiedinek. Rut, a number of senators
called on Secretary Lansing nnd urged
that he go slowly. In the lack of offi
cial information, however, the secre
tory was in no hurry to act.
I'.nnsiiiir admitted that a note to Bul
garia and Tin key is contemplated to
head off submarine outrages by these
nations if the Austrian difficulty is
cleared up.

Double Track Road From Petrograd
To Ice Free Port Boon For Russia
Petrograd, Jan. 3. (Special.) It has
been apparent since the early stages of
the war nnd is at present doubly so
that Bussia greatly needed an effic
ient and reliable mcuns of communica
tion with tho outside world. The war
conditions in the Baltic and the Black
sea left her with only very scanty
means of obtaining supplies and muni
tions. The three chief means were (1)
the Archangel route; (2) tho Trans-
Siberian railway; and (3) the Trans-
vik-lornea route. All of these have
great drawbacks. The port of Arch
angel is closed by tho iron grip of
the Arctic winter for six months in
the year from October to May
and its railway communication with
the capitul is poor and indirect. The
Transoibei'ian route is useless tor
the rapid transit of supplies and mu
nitions, and the Nirvik-Tornea route
involves shipment at the head of
the Gulf of Bothnia, which causes
delays and dangers.
The New Harbor in the North.
Bussia realized that her success
depended, and still depends, on re
ceiving promptly and in large quan
tities munitions of war. Though the
Arctic ocean is the last place in the
world where one would expect to
find an all-tho-yenr ice-free port
that is, one that is open all the year
round yet it is so at Kknterina har
bor according to the result of the of
ficial investigations.
This harbor is situated about 200
miles east of North Cape in Norway,
and tho anomalous ice-free features
are due undoubtedly to the effect of
the Gulf Stream which before finally
losing itself in Arctic waters back
washes along tho . Lapland and Mur
man coast, and prevents more than
a thin film of ice water forming in
Ekaterina harbor.- To connect this
harbor with Petrograd by an effici
ent railroad was the chief considera
tion, of Russia. American engineers
and contractors were consulted and
thousands . of men were engaged for
the work, which was begun simul
taneously at both ends. Largo gangs
of workmen wero sent to intermedi
ate points and ordered to -build to

Italians Have Not Drawn
on Great Reserve Strength
By Alice Bohe,
Home, Jan. 3. When the orchestrul
guns have boomed their last salvo and
the big asbestos curtain of peace drops
on Europe's war-torn stage, doubtless
the world will begin to appreciate tho
role by King Victor in the present
greateht tragedy of history.

"Vernon will fall before Gorizia,"

and itio play went on.
"It was not until May of this yenr
that Italy declared war on Austria. Im

outlined the following land program:

2. An offensive on a large scale
