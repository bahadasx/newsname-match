Now that tho new city council
meota tonight, would It not bo well, for
them to consider some, method of fill
Ing up that hole containing water and
filth Just back of tho postolTlco on
East Second strcotT
Several weeks ago tho trees thnt
were lining the banks of this unsightly
hole were removed or trimmed to the
water's edgo and this exposed tho
slimy water to public gaze, and at
tho samo tlmo allowed the foul odors
to clrculato more freely until now,
overy passerby gets his nostrils full
of tho obnoxious atmosphere.
Oct busy, gentlemen of tho new
council of whom wo expect so much,
nnd start tho good work by ridding
Maysvlllo of this long continued nuis
ance. Let it bo done away with at
onco.
Nover mind if it helps some piece of
Individual property. Good health to
all the pcoplo of Maysvlllo Is worth
more than helping some city property
owner.
Make n good start In tho New Year,
gentlemen.
