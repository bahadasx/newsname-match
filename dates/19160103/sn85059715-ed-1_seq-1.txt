RUSSIANS TRTADVANCING
Central Powers Are Said to Be
Experiencing Difficulty with
Bulgaria Now.
(BY ASSOCIATED PRKBS)
LONDON, Jan. 3.?The latest despatches
from the southern extremity
of t>e Russian front indicate that
heavy lighting Is continuing with the
Russian army of General Ivanoff
gaining ground. One correspondent
reports that these operations began
with an offensive movement on the
part of the Austrians designated to
strengthen their line, and that after
repulsing this attack the Russians assumed
the initiative, it Is evident
that the Russian advance has now extended
a considerable distance beyond
the Stripa river.
In other despatches it is asserted
that two great offensive actions
clashed, tho Russians having advanced
as a threat against the Teu
ions in meir uaiKnn upeiauuuo, nu.>v
the Austrians and Germans felt the
necessity of improving their positions
against the attacks expected from
General Ivanoff, early in the spring.
Whatever may be the facts there is
no doubt the result of these operations
will have an important effect
on the Balkan campaign, especially
in their influence on the future pians
of Rouinanla.
It is reported with increasing frequency
that the centra! powers are
planning an attack on Salonlkl, but
thqy are said to be experiencing difficulties
with Bulgaria, which, according
to these reports, does not
wish to participate in such a campaign
unless it promises something
more than expulsion of the Allies
from Salonikl. In Athens anxions
thought 15 doing given to the seiauie
i of the consuls representing Germany
and its allies at Salohiki. It is expected
that so far as Greece is concerned
the Incident will be closed
with the release of the consuls under
safe conduct.
Germany and its allies denouneo
t lie arrest of the consuls as a violation
of International law, while Bulgaria
has retaliated by arresting the
French vice consul at Sofia.
England awaits with the greatest
interest detalli regarding the bill for
compulsory military service, which
Premier Asquith will introduce In the
House of Commons Wednesday. It
is announced thai Ireland will come
?c th? Kill
"\viui in iiitr nvup? ui ?.?*?
Opposition to the measure, according
to some newspapers, probably
will be divided into two parties, one
opposing conscription in any form,
and the other, whJlo admitting the
necessity of some kind of compulsion,
opposing enlargement of the army.
