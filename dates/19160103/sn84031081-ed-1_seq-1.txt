Chronicle announces definitely that
Sir John A. Simon, aoeretnry of stale
for home affairs, retires from the cab

isterial career for conscience sake."
Sir John A. Simort enjoyed a rapid
r.nd brilliant career afler a remark
able success at tin; bar. lie entered
parliament in lflOti and Joined the
ministry first as solicitor general, aft
erwards as attorney neutral. He is
so strong a pacifist that he was al
most, decided to resiKn with Viscount
Morlep and John Hums when the war
broke out.
It was only the Herman violation of
r.elKi.in neutrality that induced him
to remain as a member of the govern
ment. When the coalition sovcrnmout was
formed last May, Sir Jon refused the
ureal prize of the post of lord blub
chancellor made vacant by Viscount i
Ualdane'a retirement, because he pre-!
ferred a political career and became
a home secretary. ,

W'ashinglon, Jan. 2. -Development,
of the last few days show that Then-!
, dore Roosevelt has the old guard of
jthe republican party in tho bole.
I His stock Is rising so fast thai with-'
! in a few weeks it will be apparent that
the republican Parly will have to take
n man Koosovolt practically will dic
tate or take Itoosevelt hlmse f,
I The evidence of the Itoosevelt boom
is both oral and written. The great
volume of written demands upon
Roosevelt that lie stand for the re
publican nomination continue to pour,
in increasingly. Within a few days it
has assumed the appearance of a tidal
wave. ,
Assurances I'roni Kvcry Quarter. '
Republicans from all over the coun
try are writing to him asking him to
come out and assuring him of heavy
republican states both for the nomi
nation and elect ion.
One ot these characteristic letters
the Journal correspondent has seen
was from former Oovernor i:. C
Stoks of New Jersey, who will he a
republican candidate for senator from
l that state, in reply to the suggestion
'that the people were coming round to
j him. Colonel Roosevelt w rote that he I
did not cafe so much for the people
coming 'round to him personally an
I for their coming 'round to the ideas
j he is championing.
Colonel Discounts Kcimii Ih,
Another letter from a Michigan pnl
I Itician whose writing to Roosevelt at
jail would he a shock to the party lead-
trs in that suite, ,,xi .;. . it ..on-.
'he carried .Michigan as a republican
and tm a. progressive, und could and
would ei.'rv it again.
Colonel Roosevelt has been inclined
I to discount his personal strength be
I cause of the stand he has taken
'against (Icrmany's invasion of J!el
'giitm. liul recently lie seems lo have
put that behind him. He has shifted
the defensiv,, to President Wilson by
his fierce attack on the administra
tion military plans and today has
them absolutely backed off the track,
In republican estimation.
College Men for l,rcparcliU'KS.
The Journal correspondent attended
several of the meetings of the Pan
American Scientific congress last
week with the idea of learning what
(hi' college men think of prepared
ness. There is a keen appreciation of tho
subject among them. One college
man summed it up in a discussion
immediately following the reading or
a, paper prepared by Colonel Roose
velt. The college man said:
"There are three possible positions,
first, real non-resistance; second, fool
preparedness, and third, effective pre
paredness. If the non-resistants would
bring in a resolution to scalp the navy
and disband the army they would ut
least have the courage of their con
victions. Where lUmsovclt. Comes In.
"Hut such a program would not get
one vote in a thousand. What is left V
Fool preparedness ami effective pre
paredness." Fool preparedness, this gentleman
left It to be inferred from the total
of h'S remarks, is synonymous with
Ihe administration program. Where
does Roosevelt come in?
In this way. The public suddenly
has come to believe that his prepared
ness would be real and that America
would be made ready in such way
as to give the country confidence.
Hence the amazing revival of Roose
vc.tism In the republican party. The
leaders don t want Roosevelt, though
they don't hale him as they affect to
hate him. They see what Is coming.
They see farther into it already than
Roosevelt does himself. This is why
they are putting themselves on record
for the colonel well In advance.
Pciirosci Is IViendl.v.
Senator .ioise Penrose of Pennsyl
vania only a few days ago said the
candidate would come out of the pro
ceedings of the convention. Publicly'
he declined to say in what way, but
privately tie said that if Roosevelt (lid
pot stampede the convention it would j
he miraculous. He felt so much in t
earnest about It that he added some)
kind words for Roosevelt. He had j
never had trouble with him und,
Roosevelt as president had always
treated him square.
Ii. means only one thing, that the
leaders think Roosevelt Is coming on
and that he will beat his way into the
White House on Ihe sole Issue, "shall
this country become safe from assault
or shall il fiddle Willi the question as
the democrat are boun,i to do""

Mr. Ford declared his views re-

that bankers, manufacturers of inu-i

that it Is the people themselves, those
now being slaughtered, who are re
sponsible. The men doing tho fight

who rule them do their thinking,

of their divine right to say for them

Mr. Ford's future plans with rc

Ihe party in charge of Hasten Plali

original plans, and, despite all reports
to the contrary, when 'he party left
the Msonr II it was as harmonious as
could be desired.
"The main idea of the mission.'
continued Mr. Ford, "was to crystal

the various ideas ami hopes for peace
which prevail all over the world. The
nations doing the fighting would bo

"It may hn happoned In many ways.
In the first place. It Is not yet proved
that a submarine sank the l'el'sla. If
It whs an Austrian submarine, it must
be determined whether the circum

-I am confident, at least I hope,
Hint the final explanation will tin unite
satisfactory. If the commander of

not hesitate to siitbifaelorlly adjust tha

Austria Will Mnke Amends.
"From the answer made to the last
note on the Aneona alone. It Is quite
evident that the Austro-1 lunKarhin

Complete confidence prevails in

It is understood Huron Zwoldlriek
