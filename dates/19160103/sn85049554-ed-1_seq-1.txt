London, Jan. 3.—The British steam
ship Glengyle has, been sunk. There
are about 100 survivors.
The Glengyle had on' board about
120 persons, passenger and crew. All,
with the exception of three Europeans
and seven Chinese, were landed. So
far as is known no Americans were on
board. The Glengyle, which was home
ward bound from Shanghai, was sunk
in the Mediterfwiiean on Sunday.
The Glengyle sailed from Shanghai
for London on Nov. 25. She was last
reported at Singapore, on Dec. 6. Her
route would take her thru the Suez
canal and the Mediterranean and' It
may be assumed she was sunk In the
Mediterranean, as were the Persia,
Ville de la Clotot, Yasaka Maru and
several other steamships.
Vessel of 9,336 Tons.
The Glengyle was one of the largest
steamships which has bqen sunk since
the submarine activities became pro
ndunced. Her gross tonnage "was
9,336 tops. She was owned by the
Glen line of.Glasgow.'
The Glengyle has been In service,

PERMIT TO TRAVEL
Party to Be Given Privilege of Passing
by Train Thru German Territory on
Way to Hague—Severe Restrictions
Demanded Permitted to Carry No
Baggage or Papers Ford Roaohes
Home and Expresses Changed Views.
Copenhagen, via London, Jan. 3.—
The German government has granted
the Ford peace expedition permission
to travel thru Germany to The Hague
by special train.
The final arrangements were made
thru the German consul here, who,
after consultation with Berlin, an
nounced that his government was will
ing for the expedition to proceed.
This permission was granted despite
the refusal of the American state de
partment to extend passports of the
members of the party to cover a bel
ligerent country.
Conditions Strict.
The.conditions under which the par
ty will travel are strict. Their train
will be sealed, every one being locked
in. The members of the mission will
not be permitted to carry written,
printed or typewritten papers. The
concealment of any paper, even of an
Innocent character, will result In com
plication for ,the entire party.
Other things which the party must
abandon are cameras, post cards, opera
glasses and gold coin. Most of the bag
gage of the expedition will be shipped
from here back to the United States.
It is announced that the expedition
will disband at The Hague on Jan. 12,
most of the members returning home
from Rotterdam on that date.
Picturesque Feature of Trip.
That the peace expedition will be
able to travel thru a belligerent coun
try even tho Its journey is under spe
cial guard, with the members of the
garty^^ ^mog^ prisoners,, is regarded in
__riie^ptcmre83tiefeature
that this untaue mission Iras developed.

party have been perplexed as "to now1
they would reach The Hague.
Arrangements Were made to charter
a steamer ,to Holland, but this was
found objectionable due to war condi
tions in the North sea. Finally an of
fer' of $50,000 was made for a special
train on the German railroad.
Accept Stringent-Conditions.
After negotiations with Berlin, the
German consul announced that the re
quest had been granted provided the
peacemakers' subject themselves to the
strictest military law.
It is understood that the railroad
refused to accept any pay for the trip
in addition to the regular charge in
such cases.
The 150 members of the party were
busy thruout the day complying with
special arrangements. Each was
obliged to furnish four extra photo
graphs of himself, two to be sent to
Berlin and two to the German consul.
Each must present his passports to the
German consul as proof of his Ameri
can citizenship.
Tho announcement that the party
will disband at The Hague Jan. 12, it
is explained, means that those who
are not on the permanent peace board
will depart.
FORD CHANGES WAR VIEWS.
People and Men in Trenches Respon
sible, He Says.
News Tork, Jan. 3.—Henry Ford,
who led the peaoe expedition which left
here on Dec. 4 on the steamship Oscar
II for Copenhagen with the hope of
bringing about a conference of the neu
tral nations that would end the war,
arrived here Sunday on the steamer
Bergensfjord. He confirmed cable re
ports' that his return had been hastened
by illness, but said it made a differ
ence of only a few days, as he intended
when he Teft to come back this month.
Mr. Ford declared* his views re
garding the cause of the war hav-3
undergone a marked change. When
he left he said he was of the opinion
that bankers, manufacturers of muni
tions and armament were responsible,
but he returns with the beliaf that it
Is the people themselves, those now
being slaughtered, who are responsible.
The men doing the fighting have been
too content to let those who rule them
do their thinking, and they have not
taken advantage of their divine right
to say for themselves what they shall
do and think, the pacificist asserted.
Compared With Monarchies.
"Republics are no better than mon
archies in this respect," he said
"Even in the United States we let
those whom we have elected to of
fice be swerved from their duty. We
do not assert ourselves. Personally,
I have been- a voter thirty-one years
and In all that time I have voted only
six times* sukI then b6c?.usc u?v wifo
made me.'
Of the eventual success of the
peaae mission, Mr. Ford declared he
had no doubt. "The movement is
now organized and under w*y," he
said, "People are talking about it,
and while some criticise, when people
talk they think, and when they think,
they think right."
Mr. Ford?s future plans with re
spect to the peace expedition were
uncertain, h'e' said. While he had
several ideas in mind, he deemed it
too early to speak of them. He .left

his original plans, and. despite all
