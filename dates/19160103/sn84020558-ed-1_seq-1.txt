At the same lime officials were much

disobeyed instructions in regard to tor

"Judgment should be withhold

have happened in many ways. in the

"From the answer made to the last

RUSSIA'S CAMPAIGN IN
BESSARABIA IS STILL
LEADING WAR ACTIVITY
Over Front of Three Hun
dred Miles Confident
l.nssian Force Is Hurling
Sledgehammer lJIows at
Opposing Force
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
LOXDOX, Jan. 11. Russia's cam
paign in Ressarabia continues to be
the most important visible war activ
ity. From the Pripet to the Rumanian
frontier, over a front of at least three
hundred miles, a huge Russian force
with a great a ppea ra nee of confidence
is hurling sledgehammer blows at the
opposnng force which, according to
all accounts, total at least one and a
half million of meii.
Pe-trograd still claims considerable:
successes in the early stages of the
campaign and dispatches emphasize
the excellent equipment, supplies and
munitions that Russia laid up for this
purpose.
Some London observers, speculating
on the meaning of the I lessa rabian
move, hail it as one of the most am
bitious strategic plans since the be
ginning of hostilities and predict that
it will prove a. collosal attempt to
break the backbone of the Germanic
allie-s' whole line floross the Haitians. ;
Thus one critic says:
"'The plan is that Russia and the'
other .illies, moving from different!
sides, shall meet in the p.alkans anil
gam complete mastery of that penin- j
sula. If they succeed. Turkey will be .
subdued and the vitals of Austria- j
Hungary menaced."' j
The Russians have captured the j
heights northwest of e 'zernovvitz, Ru-j
kowina, ae-cording to a dispatch to'
Reuiers Telegram e-ompany from Pet-;
rograd. They took S7t) prisoners.
So long as Russia keeps up her pres- j
ent activity just north of the Ruman
ian border, the attitude of Rumania
will continue to grow in importance.
There have been many assert ions in
the entente capitals that Rumania was
about to enter the war on the' side of
the eiile-nie allies, but nothing to sup
port this has vet been heard from the
Rumanian sources. Meanwhile in the
south of the Ralkan peninsula the en
tente" allies continue the-ir expectant
attitude toward a threatened attaek.
although Greece seems mainly occ i -pie-d
in making various diplomatic pro
tests, having followed up her polite
protest to the entente allies against
the arrest e,f the consuls by an eoiially
polite protest to the central powers
against their aeroplane flying across
Gri-ek territorv in a raid which killed
a Gre-ek sheepherder and a few sheeo.
The sinking of the steamship Per
sia with t'ne probable death of all
American consul officer brings up in
the Kuropean capitals the familiar
queery as to what the I'nited Stales
will do now. Dispatches from Knglish
correspondents picture the sinking of
the Persia as i p ir, ;c ulai ly aggravat
ing case, owing to the fact that the
ship was not only hit without warning
or opportunity for the passengers to
escape, but was also hit in a most
vital part, so that she sank almost im
mediately. For the Knglish cabine t. Wetlnesday
will be a red letter day. for on that day
Premier Asquith will introduce com
pulsion, and the premier probably nev
er ha-; hail a. more difficult task than
he will have in engineering this
measure and his speech in presenting
to the parliament is expected to be one
of the finest efforts of his career.
A message from Athens to Reuters
Teh gram compare says the Frenc h
battleship Patrie has sailed from Sa
loniki. having on boanLthe German.
Austrian. Turkish and Hulgariari con
suls at Saloniki. who were arrested
last week at the order of General Sar
rail, the French commander.
The protest made by Greece to the
entente powers against the arrest
dwells on the fact that even the Greek
government was not advised in ad
vance of the decision to take such a
drastic .step.
At a cabinet council in Alliens on
Friday Premier Skouloudis laid be
fore his colleagues the protests made
collectively by the Austrian, German,
Turkish and Rulgaiian ministers
against the arrest of the consuls. The
cabinet discussed at length the recent
events at Saloniki. and, the correspon
dent says, it is apparent the situation
has become a dedicate one which is
seriously occupying the' attention of
the Greek government.
