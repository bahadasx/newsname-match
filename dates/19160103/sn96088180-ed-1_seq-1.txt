AZTEC SUNK
AT BROOKLYN DOCK
New York,. Jan. 8,--One man la
known to have boon killed and seven
nre mlHRlng as tho resiltt of an ex
ploslou aboard the 8,600-ton Norwe
Klnn tank liner. Aateo' at a Brooklyn
dock toda.V4 " ;", ,1 :

hurled men into the air from a hols

Over. 2,000 men wero employed
about tho dock and other thousands
crowded (here to seek relatives. The

carrying oil to the allien, henco there

of antl-ajly jagents. ' -"v ""
Washlniiton, Jan. 8. The gravity
of tho International altuatlou canned
by 'tho tor)edolrt of the British liner
Glcngyle, coming on the heels of the
sinking of the liner Persia, caused
President Wllaon today to deter
mine to cut his vacation short and
return here, arriving tomorrow
morning.' ' ' " "
The Southern railway took Imme
diate steps to fetch him quickly here
and at once act to work to snd hia
private car to Hot Springs. H
should be In the capital early to
morrow. ".. V .
Meantime, official circles awaited
details of both the Peraia and Glen
gyle sinkings with moat anxious fore-
Coding. Their worst fear were
realised In the death of American
Consul McNeely of Aden and the re
ports that.tha torpedoing was wlth-
out warning, a required by Inter
national law.
The etate department expected
that Austria or Germany which ever
owned the attacking submarine
would anticipate protest or nltlm
atura from America and hence would
voluntarily diaavow the torpedoing
of the Persia and girt guarantees of
future observance of International
law. The situation seemed the more
serious from the fact that the Peraia
Incident followed so closely upon
Austria's reassuring note la the An
cona case, and that the Persia sink
ing was in turn succeeded toy the
Glengyle torpedoing.
Before any action can be taken,
however, the administration roust
first settle whether a submarine or
a mine waa responsible for the Persia
sinking, and If it was a submarine,
what its nationality was.
The state department Is deter
mined to obtain from the central
powera a binding promise that In
future submarine attacks the safety
of non-combatants, not only on liners
but on merchantmen, shall be as
sured. One result of this position
ill be a show-down in the Lusl-
tanla case, inasmuch aa Germany's
pledges in this incident have thus
tar . extended only to liners. j
Meanwhile , Charge d'Affalres
Zwledenck of the Austrian embassy
sought to have the public withhold
Judgment , He pointed out that it
had not been definitely established
that a submarine sank the Persia,
and, moreover, that the circum
stances surrounding the incident had
not been entirely proved. Hence, he
asserted, no one knows whether there
was Justification. In any event, he
suggested that Austria, through her
Antona reply, indicated her readi
ness to 4o right. He expressed him
self as confident and hopeful that it
Jbe submarine proved to be Austrian
bla government would take imme
diate steps toward a satisfactory set
tlement. ,
, la this connection, officials sug
gested that possibly the contents of
the Austrian note and 'instructions
to ' submarines contingent thereon
had not reached the submarine com
mander who tank the Persia, tf. In
deed, it waa an Austrian diver.
while It was reported , that the
president will call a cabinet session
on his return, the state department
showed the real gravity of the situ-
atlon when It said, "No effort should
be made to minimise the seriousness
of the situation." '...;.
Moreover, it was intimated that
an understanding with all the cen
tral allies as to submarine attacks
will be demanded immediately.
The presence of a .45 Inch gun on
the Persia, as reported by Consul
Garrols at Alexandria, together with
the fact that there were 25 British
officers en route to Egypt aboard,
waa regarded as of minor importance,
Inasmuch as the administration rec
ognizes the right of merchant ships
to carry small guns for defense. The
soldiers among the passengers, it was
held, could not give the vessel the
status of a "troop ship," liable to
attack without warning.
Later a special train "was rushed
to Hot Springs, Va., to bring Presi
dent Wilson back to Washington.
He may arrive before, , tomorrow
morning. -

New York, Jan. 3. Henry Ford,
back from bis peace expedition in
Europe, and former Secretary Bryan
may co-operate to oppose the mili
tary' preparedness j-rosraEi o the
administration. They conferred to
day for overman hour, and it was
thought this might have been the
subject of their talk.
Ford caite back from Europe con
fident that there may still come some
good from his expedition. At any
rate, be said, it will have been worth
while U it succeeds in the Slightest
in shortening the war. He declared
that people who allowed the mon
arch to do their thinking were re
sponsible for the war, and inciden
tally be took a fling at America for
what he regarded as a similar state
of mind here.
"The kaiser's granting permission
for the peace party to cross Germany
Is a great moral victory for the dele
gates," he said. "It will have a de
cided effect on bringing the move
ment ' Into more general favor la
Europe." '.. , "
"1 have made no plans about peace
with Bryan, said Ford after their
conference, "and as far as I know
I may never see him again." ;
Palo and haggard. Ford reiterated
Us belief that his expedition will
prove successful, even If no peace
steps result for some time.
."The American movement," ". he
continued, "will have a good effect
upon the people of belligerent coun
tries, becauee it win open their ty
to the attitude of the outside . world,
When the war is over people will
take a greater Interest in their city
and national governments.".
Ford denied that there had been
trouble aboard the peace ship except
for a few minor Incidents which
crept in and were misconstrued. ;

The new year of 1916 was ushered

High School grounds, when the
Grants Fasa grads walloped the Mod

sulllclent amount of sky attacks
and submarine defenses to thrill the
most morose. It waa an ideal day,
though the footing was uncertain,

London, Jan. 3. American Consul
General Skinner today cabled Consul
Garrela at Alexandria to obtain a
statement of the liner Persia sinking
from Charles H. Grant, of Boston. .
Upon this statement may depend
whether America will take drastic
action in the case.
Consul Robert McNeely, en route
to his post at Aden, was lost when
the big liner went down. He was
last seen struggling in the water aa
lifeboats pulled away.

speculated extensively as to Amer
ica's course now and were unanimous
In their expressions that the central
powers regard America with 1 eon-
tempt and through the Persia case
are flouting her with their acorn.
', Despite reports that there was no
panic, it was deemod significant here
that only 59 out of 241 passengers
were saved, and 94 of the crew of
150 to 200.
Moreover, only 17 out of 87 wo
men, and two out of 80 children were
rescued and landed by a warship at
Alexandria. ,;
London, Jan. 3. Fresh toll of life
was believed today to . have been
taken with the torpedoing of the
British liner Glengyle, largest of
England's ships exoept the Lusitanla
and Arable to succumb to undersea
attacks. 'About 100 aboard her were
rescued, but while It is believed she
carried no passsngers, she undoubt
edly had a large crew, some of whom
probably perished. ;
With the news of the sinking of
the Glengyle came word, too, of the
torpedoing of the Japanese vessel
Kenkon Mam. Her crew waa saved.
News of these new torpedoing ar
rived in the midst of the admiralty's
efforts to get details of the sinking
of the P. ft O. liner Persia, with
heavy loss of life, j
The Glengyle was a 9,000-ton twin

Hnow has mantled Seattle, piling, up
tho heaviest downfall In ten years.

tinuance of the storm that started

Alexandria, Egypt, Jan. 3. Of
ficer of the sunken P. ft O. liner
Persia were positive today that she
was the victim of a submarine and
not a mine, as some sources tended
to, indicate. That the loss of life
aboard her will run past the 200
mark seemed certain. Included In
the list of dead is probably Consul
R. N. Neely of Aden, reported miss
ing and said to have been last seen
struggling In the water as the ill
fated liner went down to a watery
grave. .'.;..;
Various reports of the sinking In
dicated the vessel was sunk with
out warning. The nationality of the
attaching submarine, however, was
not determined, for officers claimed.,
not to have sighted the diver, though
they said positively they had seen
the wake of her torpedo.
The second officer said he eaw the
white streak of a torpedo; hut no
survivor reported getting an actual .,"
sight of the diver.
Graphic details of the liners last
moments were told here today by
Leonard Moss, an English survivor.
There was no panic, and the loss
of Ufa was due to two things," he
said. "First, the Persia Sank In less
than six minutes; and second, most
of those aboard were having lunch
eon at the time, and were not think
ing of submarines. We were mak
ing 18 knots whon the first dull
boom came, followed" by a funny
cracking sound. It seemed only a
second when the big ship began to
Hat. Those en dock rushed to th
boats, but those on the starboard
side were worthless, because they
listed heavily. People ran up from
below, while women and children
were crying, but there was no wild
and was killed.
