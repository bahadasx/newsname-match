NEW ELECTRIC RATES
FOR COOKING AFFECT
BUT VERY FEW USERS
Supposedly Public Spirited Action of Potomac
Power Company To Supply Separate
Service Is Found To Amount To But
Little.
By S. NT. REYNOLDS.
A rude jolt is in store for the people of Washington.
Several weeks ago announcement was made that the Po
tomac Electric Power Company, of its own free will, had
gone before the Public Utilities Commission and asked
permission to lower its rates for electric current in a certain
class of household service. Henceforth, if the commission
approved, the company would make a special rate on cur
rent for household heating1. Instead of charging the.people
of Washington the same rate for cooking and heating cur
rent as it charged for lighting 10 cets pe kilowatt hour
the company offered to supply a-separate service at a rate

Last week the Public Service Commission approved
the proposed rates, with some modifications favoring pros
pective consumers..
Now for the jolt. The voluntary reduction of rates
proposed by the Potomac Electric Company, and approved
by the Public Utilities Commission, would benefit just
seventy-five electric consumers in Washington out of a
total of 25,000, on the basis of known users of current for
household purposes at the time the rates were proposed.

Officials of- the American Government, while stating

convinced that the attack on the Persia was made by a
