Railroads In 1915 Save 186
Millions By Brandeis' Ideas,
At Which They Had All Jeered
BOSTON, Mass., Jan. 3.—Brandeis was right!
The mild mannered Boston lawyer who five years
ago had the nerve to confront America's most colos
sal combinations of capital and to tell them how
their business ought to be run was dead right.
One million dollars A DAY they could save, he
declared, if only they would adopt scientific effic
iency methods! And when he told them how to do
it, you remember the way the railroads jeered!
But they aren't jeering at Brandeis today! They
merely hate him now. For 1915 has actually made
them buckle down and DO the very things Brandies
told then* toil
And the railroads' own statistics, which have just
come to light, reveal what tremendous savings have
been realized by the practice of the hated Brandeis
efficiency methods. In the fiscal year 1915 the
roads earner $163,000,000 LESS than in 1914, yet by
practicing true efficiency they actually cut operat
ing expenses by the tremendous total of $186,000,000
thus snowing really an INCREASE in net returns!
Up in a plain, bare-floored
lawyer's office here sits smiling
mildly the rather Bhy man who
accomplished all this—who start
ed the multi-billionaire railroads
along the path toward efficient
public utility.
Brandeis Is one of those radi
cals who think the function of
railroads fnd other utilities is as
much to serve the public a* to
serve private exploiters! And
Brandets was right on efficiency.
What If Brandeis should be right
in this, toor
Refuse Brandeis Credit.
Of course the railroads don't
give Brandeis a jot of credit for
the efficiency that they have just
begun to put Into practice. Wit
ness an article ln the Railway Age
Gazette, which sum* *up the
economies so far realized.
More than half of this economy
was in transportation expenses,
according to the Gazette. They
were cut down nine per cent a
mile! The efficiency has been
realized ln part by the scientific
loading of trains, using larger
cars, loading more freight into
each car, and by running more
car* per train.
And now we come to the ani
mus ln the thing. "Compared
with this actual accomplish
ment," nays the Railway Age
Gazette. "Loulb D. Brandeiß'
'scientific management' schemes
for saving the railroads a million
dollar* a day pale Into insignifi
cance."
111*. Modest Claim.
"How about It?" Brandeis was
asked. "Weren't your efficiency
'scheme*' of similar nature?"
"Why, ye*," he answered. "Ef
ficiency of this kind wa* only
part of what 1 advocated! The
Railway Age Gasette Is right,
however, in calling attention to
the result* of the operation of
the railroad* for the fiscal year
1915 a* being remarkable.
"To have reduced operating
expense* $186,000,000 when
gross earning* fell off $163,000,

Americans Buying
Back Their Roads
There are 141 railroads in the United States of
100 miles or more in length. But they aren't all
owned by Americans.
The securities of 102 of them are held in greater
or less quantity abroad. But Americans are buy
ing back these securities. The year 1!)15 has seen
not only a tremendous increase in railroad effic
iency, BUT ALSO THE RETURN TO THIS
COUNTRY OF NEARLY $500,000,000 IN RAIL
ROAD STOCKS AND BONDS!
The year 1916 and following years will bring
not only a continuation of this process, but a stu
pendous task in refinancing the roads.
It is a fitting time right now for Uncle Sam to
look to the job of making the railroads more effic
ient than ever.—Editor The Times.
