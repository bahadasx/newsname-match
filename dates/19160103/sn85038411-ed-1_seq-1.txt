I Teutons Anxious to Press For-;

By Associated Press
London, Jan. 3. The latest dis
patches from the southern extremity J
of the Russian front indicate that!
(heavy fighting is continuing, with the)
Russian army of General Ivanoff!
gaining ground. One correspondent:
reports these operations began with
an offensive movement on the part of]
the Austrians designed to straighten j
their line and that after repulsing'
this attack the Russians assumed the I
1 intiatlve. Ik is evident the Russian'
j advance has now extended a consider- i
1 able distance beyonn the Stripa river. ;
In other disDatches It. is asserted,
that two great offensive actions!
j clashed the Russians having ail-;
\anccd as a throat against the
Teuton in their Balkan operations.!
while the Austrians and Germans felt i
the necessity of improving their posi
tions against the attack expected from ;
General lvjinoff early in the Spring, i
Whatever may be the facts, there is :
no doubt ihe result of these opera-1
tions will have an important effect <
on the Balkan campaign, especially!
! in their influence on the future plans
■of Rumania.
Bulgars Hold Back
It is reported with increasing fre
quency thiit the centfal powers are

I given to ihe seizure of the consuls j

<at Saloniki. It is expected that so far'
jas Greed is concerned the incident;
■will be closed with the release of the j

j questing some such action by the j
. entente powers, Greece also has pro
-1 test.-il to Germany against the aero-j

DONA DENIES HE
IS FROM SUNBURY
But Townsfolk Believe Man
They Knew Is Husband of
"Countess Ida"
pec till to the Telegraph
Atlantic City, N. J., Jan. 3.—Francis
Albert Gilbert Dona, -who courted
"Countess" Ida Marie von Claussen
while she "was an inmate of the Hos
pital for the Insane at Middletown,
N. Y., and married her in Rrooklyn
last Tuesday, four days after her re
lease on parole, flatly denied here last
night that he ever worked as a hotel
clerk in Sunbury, Pa.
"They have confounded me," he de
clared stoutly, "with the man Dona
gan, who was an attendant at the
Middletown institution until he was
dismissed. Let them find Donagan. A
I detective has informed us he is in
Buffalo."
Dona positively refused, however, to
throw any light'whatever upon his
identity.
"I have the best of reasons for
adopting this course at this time," he
i said. "When I am ready the world
! will be told all there is to tell about
I myself." In spite of the fact that the
' financial question is still a burning
i issue for the newlyweds, the "Coun
! tess" to-day was in the highest spirits.
RELIEVES HE IS DONAGAN
Special to the Telegraph
' Sunbury, T'a., Jan. 3.—Despite his
■ denials, it Is believed here that the
! husband of "Countess" von Claussen
: is Frank 10. Donagan. formerly of this
; place. Donagan was here on a two
I weeks' visit, and he wrote on the
| register oCf the Central Hotel, "Frank
j 10. Donagan, Commercial Hotel, Mid
i dletown, N. Y." Later he changed
I his address to "General Delivery."
i Donagan is a son of Frank Dona
gan, of Kramer avenue, a machinist
| employed by the Pennsylvania Rail
-1 road.
While here Donagan told Francis
! <lemberling, of the Markley liquor
store, and Houston Taggart, c.lerk, and
j Stephen Yerkes, bartender, at the Cen
tral Hotel, of his coming wedding.
The three sent him congratulatory let
j ters.
This Donagan was employed as
night clerk at the Central in 1912 at a
salary of S3O a month. He was un
employed for two years and then,
went to Renovo. Later he claimed to
represent an Altoona shoemaklng
I concern.
Kills Aged Father to
Protect Mother's Life
Special to the Telegraph
Pittsburgh, Jan. 3.—William T. Duff,
aged 40. Is in the county jail and his
father, Thomas Duff, aged 74, is dead
as a result of what is said to have been
a son's defense of his mother from a
drink-crazed husband's attack in their
home. Deputy Coroner Harry Ewing,
who investigated the tragedy, lodged
! a charge of murder against the son,
hut it Is expected the latter will be re
leased when the inquest is held.
Cannot Understand Why
Allies Stay at Saloniki
By Associated Press
London, Jan. 3. The Athens cor
respondent of the Dally Chronicle
states in a dispatch that the King of
Greece told him he could not. under
stand what the entente allies were
supposed to be gaining In remaining
at Saloniki. The correspondent quotes
King Constantine as follows:
"I could understand their presence
so long as there was a possibility of
aiding Serbia, but now that the ob
ject of the mission has failed, why
remain? No useful military purpose
is now to be served. It is fairly
obvious that if tho Anglo-French
withdraw and sought a fresh and
more profitable field of operations the
armies of the Central powers would
withdraw also and the situation would
hold itself."
Ireland Will Not Be
Excepted From Compulsion
By Associated Press
London, Jan. 3. According to an
aniionitf-ement made by the Press As
sociation. Ireland is not to be ex
cepted from the new compulsory re
cruiting bill.
The statement that the new com-,
puisory recruiting bill will also bo
applied to Ireland, so far rests on the
authority of the Press Association,
which, however. Is often the medium I
of official Intimations. '
