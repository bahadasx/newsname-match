London, Jan. J, 10. OS p. m. Russia's
campaign in Bessarabia continues . to
be the most Important visible war ac
tivity. ; From the Pripet to the Buf
manian frontier, over a front of at
least 100 miles, a huge Russian force
with a irreat appearance of confidence
is hurling sledge hammer blows at the
opposing force, which, according: to an
accounts, total at least a million and
a. half men. ... . -Russian
Successes.
Petrograd still claims considerable
successes in the early stages of the
campaign and despatches emphasize
the excellent equipment, supplies and
munitions which Russia laid up for
this purpose, during a period of com
parative passivity. :
Soma I-ondon observers,, speculating
on the -meaning of the ' Bessarabia
move, hall it as one of the most am
bitious -strategic plans since the be-
- ginning of hostilities and predict that
it -Will prove a colossal attempt to
break the backbone of the Germanic
allies' whole line across the Balkans.

Sinking of Steamship Persia.1-"
The sinking . of the steamship Per
sia, with the death of an American
consular officer, brings up In the Eu
ropean .capitals the familiar query as
to what the United States will do now.
Despatches , from English ; correspon
dents' picture the sinking of the Per
sia as a particularly aggravated case,
owing to the fact that the. ship was
not only . hit without warning or. op
portunity for : the passengers to es
cape, but was also hit in a most vital
part, sq that she sank almost imme
diately, the whole timo from .. the
launching of the tcrpedo to the dis
appearance of the liner being only five
minutes. " ' .
Submarine ' Activity In Mediterranean.
In connection with the submarine
activity in the Mediterranean it is in
teresting to note that an official re
port shows a total of only -twenty
British steamships sunk by the sub
marines during the month of Decern
her, - with the loss of 87 lives, while
eight more were sunk by mines with
the loss of 13 lives; .
For the English cabinet "Wednesday
will be & red letter day, for on that
day Premier Asquith will introduce
compulsion: - fhe premier probably has
never had a more difficult task than
he will have, in engineering- this meas
ure and his speech, presenting it to
the house, ia expected to be one of
tne snest efforts of his career.

BRIGHT PROSPECTS FOR .
BUSINESS IN THIS COUNTRY.
Striking Contrast With Conditions Pre
vailing a Year Ago.-
"Washington, Jan. 2. Bright pros
pects for business throughout the
country, in striking contrast with con
ditions at this time a year ago, are
pictured In statistics and standards
committee report made public tonight
by the chamber of commerce of the
United States.
"There are localities in which mutfh
caution and conservatism yet remain,'
says the report, "and influence of high
prices for the future further accentu
ates this caution, because dealers feel
that high prices will curtail business
by the consumer. Broadly speaking, it
may be said that the spirit of optimism
and hopefulness prevails to a degree
that has not been apparent for nearly
a -decade, and the general belief and
expectation is for such prosperity dur
ing 191-6 as will recompense the people
of this country for all their past mis
fortunes. "The adverse effect of the conflict
in Europe still . prevails in some sec
tions, though' to a very much less ex
tent than at this time last year. There
are still scattered fears of the possi
bility of this country being; involved
in this gigantic strife, but as against
this the large portion of the people are
paying less and less attention to fhe
war and more and more are concen
trating their thoughts and efforts on
domestic matters. Beyond this is the
striking fact that the influence of the
war at present as a whole is more fa
vorable than adverse, because of the
tremendous impetus it has given to
certain lines ofmanufacturing, espe
cially east of the Alleghenies and like
wise to many agricultural products."

London, - Jan. 3. - The London
Morning- papers in ' editorials' on the
the sinking of the steamer Persia de
nounce the. act in scahing tedma and
ask whether the cup of Teutonic en
ormity, - as far as America is con
cerned, is yet fulL The Post says:
"We long ago . relinquished all ex
pectation that neutral nations would
effectively intervene in these repeat
ed outrages of International law. It
is naturally a matter for their turn
conscience, but at the same time it
must be said that , their position is
singularly inconsistent - with - their
their pleadings to the allied bellig
erents that they may be allowed to
trade with the enemy." .
The Times' - editorial assuming that
the submarine was Austrian though
it mr,y possibly may have been Ger
man or Turkish, saysr -' --
"Whatever fla is stained bv this
fresh outrage there is no room - for
hollow - synical ; explanations by which
Austria sought to amuse Wasalueton.
It -cannot -toe- -pr eieiidedj that-aEao'fer-'
sia was torpedoed in such - a gentle
fashion that the passengers ought to
have been saved, but for the culpable
negligence ot the crew, which is the
cowardly fense of the Austrian gov
ernment in the Ancona case. Even
Austrian . impudence . and dcynicosm
cannot plead that five minutes is long
enouga to save hundreds of passeng

OBITUARY.
Joseph Rueker Lamar.
Washington, - Jan. - 2. Joseph Rucker
Lamar, , associate Justice of the su
preme court of the United States, died
at his home here tonight, after an ill
ness of several months. He ' was E8
years old and had been on the su
preme bench for five years.
The immediate cause of death was
gradual heart failure, hastened by in
flammation of one of the lungs which
had threatened tojevelop into pneu
monia. The attending physician de
clared, however, that the .primary
cause was overwork, due to the ar
duous duties a member of the su
preme court and as commissioner of
the United States to the . mediation
conference between the United States
and Mexico at Niagara Falls. -.
Exhausted by last year's term of
court, Justice Lamar went to. "White
Sulphur Surlngs, "West Virginia, In
June. He improved until September,
when a clot in an artery caused him
to lose the use, for a time of his left
arm and leg. It was some time be
fore he recovered -from . this attack,
but when he returned to "Washington
in October, he planned to return to
his work on the bench in February.
About a week ago the justice con
tracted a cold. His weakened heart
was unable to bear the added bur
den of this inflammation. .. .
This morning his condition" -was
noted to be critical. In the after
noon, after recognizing- his wife and
two sons, Philip And "William, he
dropped off to sleep. Gradually his
respiration grew less frequent until
at 8.30 tonight he gave , a long sigh
and was dead. ' . v..
Arrangements for the funeral were
not completed tonight but the burial
will, take place at Augusta, Ga, for
many years the home of the justice.
The funeral party will leave "Wash
ington for Augusta . Tuesday at . 3 p.

month. - :.
. Marked Change in Views. -
Mr. Ford declared bis views regard
ing the cause of the war have under- :
gone a marked change. "When he left,
he said," he. thought that bankers and
manufacturers of munitions and arma
ment were responsible, but he returns
with the belief that it is the people
themselves, those now being slaughter
ed, arc responsible. The men doing
the fighting have been too content to
let those who rule them do their think
ing and they have not. taken advantage
of their divine right to say for them
selves what, they shall do and think,
