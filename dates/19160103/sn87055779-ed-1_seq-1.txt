OATS
WERE DEMOTE
Passengers on Persia Were at
Lunch When Torpedo
Struck Vessel.
Intem.it ion nl News Service:
ALEXANDRIA. Egypt, Jan. 3.
Many of the lifeboats on the Pen
insular and Oriental liner Persia
were destroyed by an explosion that
followed the impact of the torpedo,
it was said by survivors who were
landed here.
The passengers were at lunch
when the attack was made and all
were taken by suprise. Even the
lookout on the ship, did not see the
submarine which remained hidden
beneath the surface.
The torpedo struck on the star
board side between the funnels, rip
ping a big hole both below and above
the water line. Survivors declared
that the hole was big enough for a
street car to enter.
A great quantity of water was
thrown high into the air drenching
the entire ship. Immediately the
liner began to settle, rolling over
farther and farther upon her star
board side as the water poured into
the pap.
Just after the torpedo struck her
an explosion occurred on board the
Persia which tore away much of the
upper works. Many lifeboats were
destroyed and the sea was littered
with debris.
O.Ticers warned all the passengers
to make haste In doning life belts
as the vessel was foundering rapidly.
In the meantime the ship had swung
over so far that it was almost im
possible to swing the remaining life
boats over the side.
One boat, tilled with men, women
and children, was upset by a sudden
lurch of the sinking ship and all the
occupants were thrown into the
water. Four other boats, which had
been successfully launched, were
lashed together with ropes. These
were found by a mine sweeper T.Ö0
mile? from Alexandria and the sur
vivors were brought here.
A fifth boat was sighted drifting in
a southerly direction, but at last re
ports it had not been found.
At least 28 children were killed.

making fair promises, was not act
