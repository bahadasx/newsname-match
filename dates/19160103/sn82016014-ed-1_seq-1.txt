ten lives were lost on the Glen

Armored Bodies

Oklahoma City, Okla., Jan. 3. Be
cause of the. large number of bank
robberies and postoffice robberies in
eastern Oklahoma in recent months,
armored bodies are being placed on
two motor cars here for use of coun
ty officers in pursuing bandits. This
information was obtained today from
a local carriage builder, who asserted
he is constructing the bodies. He de
clineed, however, to make public the
name of tho officer who placed the or
der. In numbers of recent bank robberies
in the eastern counties motor cars
have been used. The robbers have
come down from their hiding places
in the Kiamlchi mountains and the
Osage hills and because of their more
rapid method of transportation, offi
cers have found pursuit on horseback
useless.
The motor car bodies, under con
struction here, are of light steel. They
are being painted black and have a
somewhat box-like appearance. Be
hind the windshield is a plate of steel,
which can be raised or lowered by the
driver by touching a pedal. It was as
serted the cost of the construction is
$100 for each.

ASKS STATE HELP
Topeka Will Refuse Payment of
Royalties to Luton
If the Commonwealth Will Pay
Expense of Fight.
Resolutions asking Governor Cap
per and the office of the attorney gen
eral to back Topeka and stand all ex
penses of litigation in case of a break
with Daniel Luten, holder of numer
ous bridge patents, was brought before
the city commission today. It was
read the first time, but in good time it
will reach the state oricials and it will
be up to them to say just how far they
are willing to back up their arraign
ment of Luten and his royalties.
Luten holds the patents on all of the
more pactical concrete bridge designs.
He requires the payment of a royalty
of ten per cent wherever a bridge con
forming to his designs is constructed.
Topeka, has been paying the royalty
year after year, finding it cheaper to
do so than to enter into litigation with
the patent holder. The payment of
the ten per cent not only permits the
city to build a bridge of the Luten de
sign but It provides also for the fur
nishing of complete plans and speci
fications of the bridge.
The resolution offered coday came
from the department of W. O. Tandy
commissioner. It is full of whereases
but stripped of Its legaj verbiage. It
simply provides that if the state of
ficials will do all the fighting and pay
the bills Topeka will stand pat and re
fuse to pay the Luten royalty. It
states that Topeka doesn't want to pay
the ten per cent royalty unless It has
to. but that it has found it to be
cheaper in the past . than taking a
chance of paying a big bill for litiga
tion. There has been a great deal of dis
cussion In relation to the Luten pat
ents and the payment of the royalties
The patent office at Washington
granted Luten his patents and he
claims to have been universally suc
cessful in suing on them. That is the
reason the officials of Topeka do n
care to risk any city money fighting a
case through the courts. But most of
the talking has been done by state of
ficials and Topeka officials are per
fectly willing to have the former spend
the state's money.

of American life. After conferences
over the telephone between the presi

tary Landing, it was announced at the

Va..
the president would arrive here
tomorrow. It was state authoritative
ly that the destruction of the British
liner Persia with loss of American
life and the destruction of the British
ship Glengyle had put such a grave

States with the Teutonic powers that
the president considered it necessary
to return at once for conferences with

MEN JUST HOW TQ
DON THEIR CLOTHES
Kansas City, Mo., Jan. 3. Men
will have an opportunity in the
future to determine the style of
their next suit of clothing at the
family motion picture theater as
a result of plans which have been
worked out by the Custom Cut
ters' Association of America,
which holds its thirty-sixth annual
convention here during: the first
four days of next month.
It has been announced that a
score of young men. whose figures
will display the spring and au
tumn lflltt styles to best advan
tage, have been engaged to serve
as visual examples for the arbi
ters of fashion and that motion
pictures will be taken of these
models.
A committee has been at work
for several months determining
what properly groomed men shall
wear this year. While results of
this will not he announced offi
cially until the opening of the
convention, there were given out
today a few preliminary Indica
tions. These point to coats which
will display shoulders about as
wide as a piece of toast.
TroiLsers are to be cut so that
even a long breath would seem an
indiscretion and to give the wear
er the appearance of being mostly
legs. The curves of the coat are
to follow the lines of the figure
with a eorsetlike effect ami no
padding will be considered proper.
Overcoats, to be proer. must be
chopped at the knee and either he
very tight or very loose, no belts
being placed on dress or day
coals, this distinction being re
served for heavy weather u liters.

London, Jan. 3. The latest dis
patches from the southern extremity
of the Russian front indicate heavy
fighting Is continuing with the Rus
sian army of GeneraMvutfdff gaining
ground. One correspondent reports
that these operations began with an
offensive movement on the part of the
Austrians designated to straighten
their line, and that after repulsing
this attack the Russians assumed the
initiative. It is evident the Russian
advance has now extended a consid
erable distance beyond the Stripa
river.
In other dispatches it is asserted
that two great defensive actions
clashed, the Russians having advanced
as a threat against the Teutons in
their Balkan operations, while the
Austrians and Germans felt the ne
cessity of improving their positions
against the attack expected from Gen
