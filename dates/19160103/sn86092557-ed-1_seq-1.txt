"The demand for Buch a board is in

Nothing Dilatory About the
~'-position of Criminal
Cases.
Tne determination ot the Democrat
ic organization of Marion county to
prevent the trial of the Fairmont char
ter case on Ub merits is becoming
more alarming to friends of law, or
der and good government as each day
passes.
Although two full weeks have elaps'
ed Blnce Monday, December 27, when
the Democrats succeeded in delaying
a decision in the local courts on tho
ground that briefs were necessary At
torney Scott Lowe told Judge YV. S.
Haymoud today that ho had not as
yet started to prepare the briefs ana
that at least another (lay would be
necessary.
Attorney Lowe's statement in open
court today that he did not believe
that the case has yet "matured" would
seem to Indicate every possible ef
fort will bo made to prevent a tie-,
cislon by Judge Haymond during this
term of court which is scheduled to
end this weolt or earl next week. This
would mean that the case would have
to go over until the March term of
! court and possibly longer.
The. dilatory manner in which .tho
case is being handled Is in marked
contrast with, the apeod with which
27 poor foreigners were sentenced to
.-hea*y"?^WMMn?>t?'^hrocv%Qf
life terms in the peniteutiary and tlio
other 24 to long terms as a result
of a fight between striking coal min
ers at Farming-ton and county officers
which resulted in tho death of one
man.
It required only a few short weeks
to consign these poor men to long
terms of imprisonment behind thu
gray stone walls of the state penitent
iary. There was no delay in sentenc
ing the strikers. It was not deemed
necessary in those cases to grant long
delays that depositions might be tak
en in distant parts of th<? state. It
was not deemed necessary in th030
cases that attorneys bo granted weeks
and weeks In which to prepare briefs
which ought to have been prepared
in advance of which at best coulfl
be prepared in few hours.

Fairmont People Remember
Suggestion of 20 Years
Ago.
PASTORS URGE CAUTION
Physicians Say the Conta
gion is Spreading and
Some Cases Severe.
A numbor of Fairmont citizens are
wearing sulphur in their shoes at this
time as a preventive against the epi
demic of grip that is sweeping the
country.
According to some residents of
Fairmont, at tile time_the epidemic of
grip swept the country twenty years
ago, Dr. George Angel, a celebrated
physician and for a number of years
editor of "Dumb Animals," wrote an
artlclo for the magazine in which he
recommended that everybody wear
sulphur in their shoes as a preven
tive of the scourge which swept the
country, carrying death and destruc
tion in its wake. Dr. Angel said the
discovery was made that miners work
ing in the 3ulphur mines wore im
mune to the disease and this lead
to experiments, and In every case
proved a success, not a case develop
ing where sulphur was worn in the
siloes.
Ho recommended that teaspoonful
lie sprinkled in the soles of shoes and
worn during the duration of the epi
demic.
Older residents remembering the
admonition of Dr. Angel, today arj
testing the remedy.,! ..
In several of .the pjilplts of the city
yesterday tlie.paators warned their
conBi:egation?-fbaln'st-the..Baldemio
which--Seems., to be Rettlng '-Faffmont
In . Its clutch, and asked that extraor
dinary precautions be taken In this
regard to stop a spread of the'con
tagion.
Local physicians state that the num
ber of grip patients'is constantly in
creasing. The disease has so far
attacked the throat and ears and In
many cases completely prostrates the
patient.

ginian's Guests.
Almost one hundred seats were tak'
en at the Newsboys' dinner given by
The West Virginia at the First M. K.
Church New Year's Day. The boys
made nil effort to meet at the Y. M.
C. A. to march to the ohurcli but on
account of the heavy rnln they had to
catch street cars and ride or got to
the corner of Fairmont avenue and
Fourth street as best they could,
j With caps wringing wot and umbrcl
I las dripping, about 75 of them reached
the church at 12 o'clock and took r.eats
on benches around the walls until they
were called to dinner and given their
places at the table by Charles Itob
inson.
As soon as the hoys had all been
provided with chairs at the fostlve
tables Rev. Mr. Beavins lnvolkod a
blessing and they immediately sat
down to dinuor.
Everything that could be crowded
into a Now Year's day dinner was
served by the King's Daughters of
the church. The hoys wore exceeding'
ly well behaved and a mannerly
crowd, only showing more than usual
delight at the edibles placed before
them.
While waiting outside the dining
room door the hoys were occasionally
heard to say "Hurry up Mister I aint
had no breakfast yet." When asked
why they had gone without break
fast the youngsters laughingly replied
that they needed the extra room for
turkey.
The Newsboys' dinner Is an annual
event, being given to the boys In this
section who sell papers, so they may
have a chance to start the New. Year
with a goodly supply of food as well
as bringing good .fellowship about
among the boys. W. J. Wiegel of the
West Virginian, presided over the
feast and after all the little belts
had to be let out, he told the young
sters what was best for them for the
New Year and how, If they tried they
could make selling papers Just as
great A business syBtem as any of the
largest In the country.
To the tune of "It's a Long Way to
Tlpperary," which was sung by all
the boys who ' could catch their
breaths,; the ri?w?fe? left the festive
hall and'went rto'the Colonial theatre
