the excellent equipment, supplies and

Home London observers, speculating
(on the meaning of the Rossarablan
move, hall It as one of the most nm
bitlous stratcplr plans since the be
pinning of hostilities, and predict that
A It will prove a colossal attempt to
K break th* backbone of the Germanic
H rillles' whole line across the liaikans.
* Thus, one critic says:
"The plan Is that Russia and the
other allies, moving from different
sides, shall meet In the Ralkans and
pain complete mastery of that penln
Kiila. If they succeed, Turkey will be
suhdued and the vitals of Austria

i impractltable lawe which he says have

to excessive administrative ccst throuuh
the present practice of employing both
county and State engineers on each ^

the law which prevents localities from ;
adopting the kind of road best .?-uited to
their needs, aid the failure to take ad
j vantage of native materials to the best
I advantage
Senator Hyrd points *.o the fact that
? a number of counties, because of the
' arbltraty conditions of the present road
i laws find it more economical to build
; their own highways In their own way,
i sacrificing the State aid fund. rather
than submit to the conditions and high
overhead charges which the State aid
law requirest
' HOADS VKKDKI) TO
niSTHllU'TH FA It M rnonrcTs
Senator Hyrd's statement follows.
Virginia is an agricultural State, and
Its prosperity depends upon a compre
hensive system of Improved highways,
not only for the economical production
i and distribution of farm products, but
for the promotion of the broader social
'life of communities and the enjoyment
I of the humanities offered by our highly
| developed civilization.
My seven years' experience as presi
ednt of the Valley Turnpike Company
i has led me to give our existing State
| road law very careful and painstaking
! Investigation.
As the laws have now been In opera
i tion for nine years, we can tnirly tike
stock of results. My observation leads
i me to believe that:
The present laws cannot be ndmln
. Istered with aconomy. Its basic prln
i ciples are not such as to enable fitep
by step the comprehens've improvement
of all main tarveled highways, and in
j the Valley of Virginia, at least, the
i law is condemned by popular sentiment.
The law is based not upon common
sense, nut upon an unworkable theory
i and has utterly failed to produce re
' suits commensurate with the g.e.it
sums expended.
' HRMl'.VKS I#A W IS IIASF.D
OX FA I,SIC TICIOOHY
The law is based upon the false.the
ory that the construction of n costly
type of road 's permanent r.nd makes
no provision for maintenance. That is
the theory, but the fact Is that these
costly so-called permanent roads have
rapidly deslntegraled.
Roads costing $4,000 and $5,000 a
mile'may be Justifiable if permanent,
but to expend this sum on roads, which
experience has proved to be short
lived and rob all other roads of any
Improvement is folly.
Tf State aid macadam roads were
generally built as required by the
? Highway Commission both the counties
Sand the State would bankrupt them
|sel\es. The question, therefore, la what
] is best to be done with the resources
I at our disposal.
\utomohile boulevards are desirable,
hut the construction of roads ur.ed in
the transportation of farm products
shculd be the first consideration.
In agricultural communities, rho
value of good roads lie in their con- 1
tlnulty: not In the construction of a
mile or so of good roads connected J
with unimproved ronds, but in the im
provement of all main traveled roads to
a general average, varying with trnf- i
?lc conditions.

The average haul of farmers' produce J
Is ten mllen, and for a farmer to roach
a fancy road, after traveling over el?ht
or nine miles of mud road, ih of little

by the worst mud hole and steepest
grade on his route.
As the counties must pay one-half

in the path of the fire, which is spread

The explosion was placed In May

'and the building was demolished,
j However, it immediately caught fire
? and flames spread to surrounding
buildings. A high wind is taking the
? fire directly through the heart of the
business section, and. should the Char

'delayed. It Is feared that the entire
town, with the exception of the resi
dences to the west, may be lost.
Battling with a hand-engine and a
i few feet of hose, members of the Gor

i vainly to gain control of the conflngra

tion. they turned to the use of dyna

l familiarity with the use of the explo

ance. The explosion that wrecked the!
meat market started two other fires
and led to the destruoticn of the last |
buildings on this block.
Buildings on both sides of Main Street
have been burned on the block next '

! in the kitchen preparing breakfast.
I Her husband entered shortly before T
'o'clock, and, seizing his wife, slashed
! her several times about the neck with
.a razor. He then struck her over the
head with an ax, and, retiring to the
front yard, placed the barrel of his

knew nothing of the incidents that led
: up to tiie killing, and neighbors are
unable to account for the act, except
on the theory of temporary insanity.
Last summer Mr. Johnson suffered a

recovered. The loss of a small invest

Mr. Johnson was postmaster of Ivor
for about sixteen years, retiring with
the advent of the Democratic admin
istration. Since that time he and his
wife, by a second marriage, lived com
fortably in their home together. While
not wealthy, the Johnsons were con
i sldered in good circumstances. Mr.
Johnson was about seventy years of
aRe, and his wife, who was a Miss
'OreRory. of Dillwyn, was fifteen years
younger. Surviving are several chil
dren of Mr. Johnson by his first wife,
and Daniel llowilen, of Norfolk, a half
brother.
The suicide left two notes, one ad

taker, giving instructions as to the
disposal of the bodies, and the other
to I*'. It. Pulley, a justice of the peace,
who has not yet opened the document.
10. P. Gregory. of Dillwyn, only
brother of Mrs. \V. 10. Johnson, who
was murdered yesterday at Ivor by her
husband, arrived in Richmond last
night by automobile, on his way to
Ivor. He attributed the murder and
suicide to Insanity on the part of Mr.
Johnson. He said that for some time
his sister had feared that her husband
was losinR his mind. Several weeks
