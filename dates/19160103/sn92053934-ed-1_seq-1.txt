WILSON ENDS
TRIP TO ACT
INNEWCRISIS
President to Return From
Hot Springs to Take the
Reins at Capital.
DETAILS ARE LACKING
'further News of Persia Dis
aster Awaited Had Gun
on Board, Report.
London, Jan. 3. The exact num.
ber of lives hist in the sinking of
the Persia is still unknown. Ad
vices from Cairo and Alexandria
Indicate that 15 survivors have
been landed, of whom . were pas
sengers. Hope that others have
been saved is diminishing.
So further word lins been re
ceived concerning Robert '. JIc
Xeeiy, American consul at Aden,
Arabia, and there seems little
doubt he drowned. The safety of
Charles Grant of Boston having
been established, It is thought Mr.
Mc'eely was the only American
who perished.
Washington, Jan. 3. After Sec
retary Tumulty had telephoned to
President Wilson at Hot Springs
early today it was said at the
White house that the president
was preparing to return, probably
tomorrow to take charge of the in
ternational situation.
President Wilson will return to the
capital tomorrow to take charge of the
new crisis in foreign relations caused
by the submarine campaign in the Med
iterranean with loss of American life.
After conferences over the telephone
between President Wilson and Secre
tary Tumulty and Secretary Lansing it
was announced at the White house and
also at Hot Springs, Va., that the pres
ident would start back to Washington
tonight, arriving tomorrow.
Considers Situation Grave.
It was stated authoritatively that the
destruction of the British liner Persia
. with loss of American life and the de
struction of the British ship Glengyle
had put such a grave aspect on the re
lations o the United States with the
Teutonic powers that the president
considered It necessary to return to
the White house at once for confer
ences with Secretary Lansing and the
other members of the cabinet to shape
the course of the government.
The situation as it exists today was
described in official quarters as paral
leling the crisis which was caused by
the sinking of the Arabic close on Ger
many's assurances in response to the
representations of the United States
on the destruction of the Lusitania.
Tension Is 11 ten.
While American officials are keep
ing their minds open until they they
have all the facts in the Persia case of
ficially and know whether Americans
were endangered in the sinking of the
Glengyle, the gravity of the situation
is not n.inimizpd. and the declaration of
Baron Zwiedenik. the Austrian charge,
that he was confident .he final explan
ation would he satisfactory has not
lessened the tension.
Gun Question Perplexing.
One new fact delevoped in the Persia
case. The American consul at Alex
sadia reported that the ship carried
one 4. inch gun but did not state
where the gun was mounted. This may
become a factor in the case. The
Hague convention, however, provides
that a merchant ship may carry a gun
mounted on the stern for the purpose
of defense without being considered an
nned ship.
The official view here is that the
question whether a gun was mounted
on the Persia will depend entirely on
where It was placed. If mounted for
ward, officials realize the Austrian gov
ernment could contend the Persia wa3
armed for destruction of submarines
and bad instructions to ram or de
stroy the submersibles. The disposi
tion is not to assign the Incident of the
gun to a place in consideration of the
case until all facts are known.
Regard Crisis as Parallel.
Officials consider that the Austrian
submarine campaign in the Mediter-

CHANGE ROUTINGS
London, Jan. 3, (5;06 a. m.) The
possibility of British liners which are

their route, as the Dutch and Japanese

6ERMANSEAL
PUT ON FORD
PEACE PARTY
Berlin Government Will Per
mit Expedition to .Visit
the Hague.
UNDER STRICT ORDERS
Belligerents Exacting in Ex
tending $50,000 Favor
to Pacificists.
Copenhagen, Jan. 3 (via London,
10:20 a, m.) The German govern
ment has granted the Ford peace ex
pedition permission to travel to The
Hague through Germany by special
train. The party will leave Copen
hagen next Friday.
The final arrangements for the trip
were made through the German con
sulate at Copenhagen, who, after con
sultation with Berlin, announced that
his government was willing for the
mission to proceed through German
territory. This permission was grant
ed despite the refusal of the Ameri
can state department ' to extend the
passports of the members of the par
ty to cover a belligerent country.
Travel Under Seal.
The conditions under which the
Americans will travel are strict
Their train will be sealed, every one
being locked within. None will be
permitted to touch German soil dur
ing the journey. The members of
the commission will not be permitted
to carry written, printed or (type
written papers. The concealment of
any paper, even of an innocent char
acter, will result in complications for
the" entire party. Other things that
the party must abandon before reach
ing German territory are cameras.,
postcards, opera glasses and gold
coin. Most of the baggage of the
expedition will be shipped back to
the United States from Copenhagen.
It is announced that the expedition
will disband at The Hague on Jan.
12, most of the members returning
home from Rotterdam on that day.
Project More Picturesque.
That the peace expedition will be
able to travel through a belligerent
country, even though its journey is
under special guard with the mem
bers of the party almost as prisoners,
Is regarded in Europe as the most
picturesque feature that this unique
project has developed.
For days the managers of the party
were perplexed as to how they could
reach The Hague, which previously
had been selected as the party's ulti
mate goal. The United States gov
ernment had refused to extend the
passports of the delegates so as to
enable them to travel through Ger
many, although an appeal had been
made to Minister Morris at Stock
holm and to Minister Egan at Copen
hagen to this end. Definite word
came from Washington, however, it is
declared, that the peace party must
be kept out of warring countries, as
its presence in them might entail
complications.
To Be $50,000 Trip.
Finally Gaston Plantiff, Mr. Ford's
representative, went to the German
minister and consul in Copenhagen,
offering to pay $50,000 for a special
train and explaining that the party
did not desire to remain on German
soil. The request was granted, pro
vided the peacemakers hold them
selves to the strictest military laws.
It is understood the German rail
road refused to accept any pay above
the usual rates for such trips.
The announcement the party will
disband at The Hague on Jan. 12, as
explained, means only that those who
are not connected for places on the
permanent peace board will depart.
ARREST ALL CONSULS

ter's Athens correspondent says that

Greek government has protested. At
the Austrian and German consulates

consul in espionage were discovered.

JUSTICE SUPREME
COURT SUCCUMBS
m-mmimm J
JUSTICE JOSEPH B. LAMAR.
Washington, Jan. 3. Arrangements
are being made today for the funeral
of Joseph Rucker Lamar, associate
justice of the supreme court, who died
at his home here last night of gradual
heart failure. Following custom, the
court after meeting today, adjourned
immediately in respect to the memory
of the late justice.
The burial will be at Augusta, Ga,
for many years the home of the late
Justice. The funeral party, which
probably will include his associates
on the supreme be.nch, will start for
Augusta Tuesday afternoon.
It was believed here today that be
cause of the important cases now
awaiting consideration before a full
court, President Wilson will make an
appointment at once to fill the vacancy
caused by Justice Lamar's death. Last
fall when Justice Lamar's health be
came Impaired and when a movement
was started to retire him on full pay,
Secretary of Interior Lane and Solici
tor General John W. Davis were men
tioned as his possible successor.
Messages of condolence reached the
Lamar home today from all parts of
the country.
Mr. Lamar suffered the stroke of
paralysis while passing his vacation
at White Sulphur Springs, W. Va. He
was brought to WTashington a few
days before the supreme court con
vened, in October. He was unable to
take his place on the bench and his
friends had virtually decided to ask
congress to retire him upon full pay.
The Justice, who was 58 years old,
had not been In robust health for many
years. He resigned from the supreme
court of Georgia, his native state, In
1905, because of ill health.
Mr. Lamar was appointed to the
United States supreme court by Presi
dent Taft.
PEOPLE OF MARS
ENJOYING SPRING
Flagstaff, Ariz., Jan. 3. Observa
tions of Mars In progress at the Low
ell observatory here have developed,
it was announced today, striking cor
roboration of the theory of seasonal
dependence of the planet's canals on
the melting of the polar cap.
The northern canals are now very
dark, indicating increased activity
with advancing spring, while the
southern canals are faint.
The season In the northern hemis
phere of Mars is now late April.
THE WAR TODAY
Paris mentions heaTy cannonad
ing in several districts along the
Franco-Belelan front. A with
drawal of French troops along a
200 metre front in the llartmans
Weilerkopf sector after a violent
bombardment by the Germans is
admitted. Two German munitions
depots in Belgium were blown up
by French guns.
The latest dispatches from the
southern extremity of the Russian
front indicate continued heavy
lighting with the Russian army of
General Ivanoff gaining. One cor
respondent reports these opera
tions began with an offensive
movement by AuKtrians, designed
to straighten their line, and that
after repulsing this attack, the
Russians assumed the initiative.
The Russian advance has now ex
tended considerably beyond the
Stripa river.
In other dispatches it is assert
ed that the Russians having ad
vanced as a threat against the
Teutons in their Balkan opera
tions, the Austrlang and Germans
felt the necessity of improving
their positions against the attack
expected from General Ivanoff
early in the spring.
It is reported that the central
powers are planning an attack on
Saloniki but they are said to be
expecting difficulties with Bulga
ria, which does not wish to partic
ipate in such a campaign unless it
promises something more than ex
pulsion of the allies from Saloniki.
Greec has protested to Ger
many against the aeroplane attack
on Saloniki. Germany and her al
lies denounce the arrest of the
consuls as a violation of interna
tional law. Bulgaria already has
retaliated by arresting the French
lice consul at Sofia.
