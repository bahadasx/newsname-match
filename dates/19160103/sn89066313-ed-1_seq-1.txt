TWO VETERANS DEAD
W. S. Culbertson and G. W.
Carson Fought Under the
Stars and Bars.
Two confederate veterans, W. S.
Culbertson and George IV. Carson,
died in Columbia Saturday and were
buried yesterday.
Funeral services for W. S. Culbert
son, 76 jears old, who died of grip at
his home, 1621 Paris road, were con
ducted by the Rev. Madison A. Hart.
Mr. Culbertson was born in Bourbon
County, Kv. Octooer 13, 1839. He
fought in the Confederate army, under
the leadership of General Price.
He came to Columbia thirty jears
ago and took up the carpenter's trade.
He also worked in the undertaking de
partment of the Parker Furniture
Company.
For the last four jears his health
had been poor. A week ago he took
cold and the grip that followed re
sulted in his death.
He leaves a wife and three daugh
ters: Mrs. Cornellia Woods and Mrs.
M. 0. Turner of St. Joseph and Mrs.
Charles E. Woods, who lives at 405
Price avenue, Columbia.
George W. Carson, 75, died of pneu
monia at his home, 206 Broadway.
The funeral services were conducted
by the Rev. T W Young and burial
was at Rocheport. Mr Carson leaves
a w ife and daughter, Mrs. Oscar Raw-
lings of Columbia.
Mr. Carson led an eventful life. Not
long before his death he began to
write a history of his life for the
period from 1SC1 to 1S64, but never
finished it. In this history he tells
of his experiences first as a Con
federate soldier and then as a raider
with Quantrell. Most of the history
deals with fighting around Sprlng
fipid nml Boonville !
Writing of Quantrell's raid on Law-1
rraicp. Kan., he said: '
"When we got there we killed every I
male that was old enough to wearl
pants. Some women were also killed
and wounded We then burned the
town to ashes 'On to Lawrence' was
the cry. We went and we conquered.!
After five dajs and nights of raiding j
we found a farm house where we,
thought we would get some sleep.
The federal soldiers soon came on,
and told us to come out. Three of
mi., mon surrendered but Quantrell
and I and eight others opened the'
door and shot our way to liberty. et
hid in the timber near by. The three
men who surrendered were killed by
the federals."

Judge Samuel Davis of the fifteenth ju
dicial cirtuit of .Missouri to be called
