The special agents working for the

"A little liquor," Bidwell told Hill's

"Same here," Brunson said,

Washington today still awaited fur

worst fears were practically realized
in the death of American Consul Robt.

In any event, American officials
held today this government must se

two points before acting: Whether a

offending submersible.

Officials believed one result will be a

agreement, applying not only to

He planned to call on Secretary

caused Ambassador Bernstorff jto
give Secretary Lansing his pledge
against future violations.
Zwledlnek 1b apparently following
the same proceedure.
State department officials antici
pated little difficulty In ultimately de
termining the nationality of the Per
sia's assailant. They also pointed
out that the only testimony that a
submarine and not a mine was respon
sible, is that of a single officer of the
Persia that he saw the wake of a
torpedo just before the explosion.
American Consul Garrels at Alexan
dria is under orders to get affidavits
from Charles H. Grant, the American
survivor, officers and other survivors
of the Persia, on this important poTnt.
The next move probably will be in
quiries, either through Teutonic em
baapies- here or American diplomat*
abroad, fOr any information the Ger
man and Austrian admiralties may
have. A reasonable time for the sub
marine to return to its base and re
port will be awaited. Officials are
practically convinced, however, that,
if a submarine was responsible, it
was of Austrian nationality. It la
not believed the Turks nave subma
rines operating in the eastern Medi
terranean, but if so, they probably
are manned by Germans.
Presence aboard the Persia of a 4.7
inch gun and of twenty-five British
officers enroute to Egyptian posts,
were regarded by officials as probably
of minor ultimate importance. This
government recognizes the right of a
merchant vessel to carry small calibre
guns, up to 4.7 inches, for defensive
purposes. Improbability that the sub
marine commander could have seen
a small gun on the Persia, officials
believed, removed this circumstance
from the list of possible excuses. Offi
cials also declared the few British
soldiers on the passenger li^t could
not be held as giving the Persia the
status of a "troop ship." Whether a
vessel is "armed" for offensive pur
poses, this government has held to
be determined in each individual
case, but officials doubt if one or two
guns aboard the Persia could be seri
ously advanced as a mitigating fac
tor.
The report of Consul Garrels from
Alexandria, regarding the gun said,
Persia carried 4.7 gun, sunk."
