that he was confident the final expla- .
nation would be satisfactory has not .
lessened the tension.
One new fact developed today in the {
Persia case. The American consul at
Alexandria reported that the ship car- J
rled one 4.7-inch gun. but did not state !
where the gun was mounted. This I
may become a factor in the case. The
Hague convention, however, provides
that a merchant ship may carry a gun
mounted on her stern for purpose of
defense without being considered an j
ainicn snip.
Gun's Location Important. 1
The official view here is that the question
of whether a gun was mounted on
the Persia will depend entirely on
where it was placed. If mounted forward.
officials realized the Austrian
government could contend the Persia
was armed for destruction of subma- J
rlnes and had instructions to ram or
destroy the subniersibles. The dispo- i
ition is not to assign the incident of
the gun to a place in consideration of
the case until all the facts are known.
officials consider that the Austrian
submarine campaign in the Mediterranean
has brought on Just such a i
crisis as did the German submarine !
campaign in th<> declared war zone I
round the British Isles. Coining Hone |
on the conciliatory assurances in Austria's
Ancona note, the continued submarine
activity, principally around the
entrance to the Suez canal, has alarmed
and amazed American officials, who
have grave apprehensions over the developments
of the next few days.
Secretary Lansing also said that some
act Jon would he taken formally to notify
Turkey and Bulgaria of the attitude
of the Cnited States toward submarine
warfare, %o that all the central
power belligerents operating in the
Mediterranean might be informed.

Mr. Lansing was asked today what
the altitude of the State Department
would be if investigation developed
that Austrian submarines in the Mediterranean
were commanded by Geri

the department was inclined to let the

SINK OF PERSIA
WITHDIITWARNING
Correspondent Says Liner
Went Down So Quickly Boats
Could Not Be Launched.
CONFIRMS REPORT THAT
U. S. CONSUL PERISHED
Conflicting Statements Made as to
the Number of Survivors Landed
at Alexandria.
LONDON, January 3, 4:32 a.m. ? The
Cairo correspondent of Reuters Telegram
Company sends the following concerning
the sinking of the Persia in the Mediterranean
Thursday:
"Nobody aboard the Persia saw the
torpeck). The second officer is under the
impression that he saw the ripple of it.
The survivors, after thirty hours in boats,
were rescued by a warship. Six officers
were saved.
"The liner sank so quickly that there
was no time to launch the boats. Waves
soon enveloped the deck and swept the
passengers and crew into the sea. Col.
Bigham was standing on the deck beside
Miss Hughes. He was suddenly swept
into the sea. and sank. On rnminsr nn he
bumped against a boat and thug was
saved. Two other boats which were seen
to be launched are missing. It is thought
there is little hope that further survivors
have been rescued."
Says Consul McNeely Perished.
Reuter's Cairo correspondent makes
the unreserved statement that Robert
McNeely, American consul at Aden, lost
his life. Charles H. Grant of Boston
was saved.
Details ot the sinking of the Persia
came in slowly yesterday, but such information
as was received made it
appear that the number of persons who
escaped in the four boats which were
put off was larger than was hoped
when the first news was received yesterday.
The Peninsular and Oriental
Company, which owned the Pee^ia, announced
this morning that 158 survivors
had arrived at Alexandria. The
survivors comprise the chief officer,
second officer. 7 engineers, 27 seamen,
63 Lascars and 59 passengers.
A Lloyd's dispatch gives the number
as 153. made up of 59 passengers, of
whojp 17 are women, and 94 members
of the crew, including 59 Lascars.
Unofficial dispatches from Cairo state
that the Persia was torpedoed without
warning and sank in five minutes.
Asserts Ship Was Torpedoed.
The Peninsular and Oriental Steamship
Company last night received the following
telegram from Col. C. C. Bigham, who
was among the survivors.
"A torpedo struck the ship on the port
bow at 1:05 o'clock in the afternoon
when about forty miles south of the east
end of the Island of Crete. No warning
was given, nor any attempt to assist.
Within Ave minutes the ship had sunk.
"It was impossible to lower the starboard
boats, owing to the heavy list.
Five r?r Kir boats wprfi lowered on the
port side. I didn't see this myself, as
i was washed overboard when the boat
capsized.
"The conduct of the passengers and
crew was splendid; there was no
struggling and no panic. Four boats,
after thirty hours at sea, were picked
up by warship."
Boats Swamped When Liner Sank.
A dispatch to the Times from Cairo
says that two boat loads of people
were drawn down with the steamer
Persia when she sank, as there was no
time to cut the ropes. Four boats got
away- but it was thirty hours before a
trawler picked them up. Several ships
passed by without assisting the refugees,
being afraid, presumably, of decoys.
Many passengers were thrown
into the water when the vessel heeled
over.
Loss of Life Not Ascertained.
It still is impossible to give, ever
with approximate accuracy, the loss ol
life, as the number of persons on board
has not been established. The passengers
numbered something more thar
200, and there were between 200 anc
300 members of the crew, so that ap
parently the death list will run largely
in excess of 200.
Such fragmentary accounts of the dis
aster as hj^'e been obtained from survivors
furnish little new informatioi
concerning the circumstances of th<
sinking. All agree, however, that th<
Persia sank with extraordinary rapidity/
within about five minutes of tht
time she was struck, affording smal
opportunity for rescue work. None ol
the survivors who have thus far reported
their experiences saw any sigr
of a submarine.
The extent to which popular feeling
has been aroused in the allied nation:
by the sinking of the Persia is indi
rated by the unrestrained tone of press
comment. There is inuch speculatior
as to the possible influence of this even
on the negotiations which are in prog
ress between the united States ant
Austria.

CONGRESS RESUMES1
LABORS TOMORROW,
5
Both Houses Expected to Settle
Down to Business
Immediately.
?
Congress will reconvene tomorrow at g
; noon, following the holiday recess, and
i both houses are expected to settle down
I to business immediately. r
The foreign relations of the United
States, incident to the war in Europe, v
and also to the trouble in Mexico, will
hold the center of the stage, along
with national preparedness and pro- s
posed revenue legislation.
Practically nothing was done beyond
the organization of the new Congress
before the holidays, and it is expected g
that the democratic leaders of the Sen- ^
ate and House will_lnsist upon speeding
up the legislative wheels immediately.
g
It is expected that the Senate com- 0
mittee on foreign, relations will take
the lead in actual consideration of in- v
ternational affairs. However, it is considered
likely that members of the Senate
will air their views of the existing a
conditions on the floor of the Senate. to
Want Congress Consulted. v
In view of the strained relations
which exist between the United States "V
and Austria-Hungary, due to the Ancona
incident and the later Persia incident,
and the possibility that a break
i may come in the diplomatic relations v
between this country and the dual
, monarchy, some members of the Senate c
today are insistent that the entire con- J
' troversy be submitted1 to Congress by _
the President before any steps are ~
taken to break off relations. When he
contents of the second note from Aus- J
tria became known last week the hope
was raised that the crisis had passed.
But the sinking of the Persia almost
immediately afterward has caused a j
renewed demand that Congress be consulted
In the matter. I
The foreign relations committee of! ^
the Senate has before it the resolution c
1 offered by Senator Hoke Smith of Geor- a
f gia, urging an investigation into Brit- Vl
. ish interference with neutral shipping, f*
and the Lodge amendment directing
" also that investigation be made into a
i the "law and facts" concerning the de- bi
I struction of the Lusitania and attacks
upon other vessels, imperiling American b<
lives, and the conspiracy against neutrality
"within our borders," to which
President Wilson referred in his mes- C
. sage to Congress.
Has Prepared Another Speech. ^
> Senator Hoke Smith has prepared an.
[ other speech upon the commercial sit|
uation and the part the allies are play;
ing in it, which he expects to deliver J
[ early in the session.
f When the Senate convenes tomorrow,
- practically the only important legislation 1
on the calendar will be the Philippines '
bill, reported by Senator Hitchcock, chair- *
* man of the Philippines committee. Sena- ti
* | tor Kern, the democratic leader, today a
* said he thought this bill might be e
* taken up and made the unfinished busi1
ness of the Senate, though much would
t depend upon Senator Hitchcock's desires c
" in the matter. The latter will reach c
* Washington tomorrow. It is understood
ttyit he desires to push the bill as fast b
as possible. c
The military and naval affairs com- t,
mittees of both Houses have been jj
studying the national preparedness a
. program during the recess. House com- t<
mittees plan to get to work on these n
at once, and public hearings, which '
probably will extend for a long period,
- are contemplated. Senate committees,
? meantime, will study the bill's submitted
and map out programs of pror
cedure.
I The Revenue Situation.
1 The revenue'situation also will com- A
mand immediate attention. Represent- t
' ative Kitchin, majority leader and ,a

Athena Dispatch Says Thirty Large
Transports Have Arrived
in the Gulf of
Orfano.
PARIS, January 3, 9:55
a.m.?A report that German
cavalry has been seen just
north of the Greek frontier
is forwarded in a dispatch to
the Havas Agency, filed yesterday
at Athens.
LONDON", January 3.?An
Athens newspaper states that
martial law will be declared January
15, and that the chamber of
deputies has been sunuponed to
meet on the 17th to ratify the
proclamation thereof, according
to a dispatch received here.
A dispatch from Athens reports
the arrival in the Gulf of Orfano
(on the coast of Greece east of
Saloniki) pf thirty large transports
full of troops, who began
to disembark. The report is unconfirmed.
jSBigari j&oiaing
It is reported with increasing frequency
that the central powers are
planping an attack on fTdloniki, but
: they are said to be experiencing diftl!
culties with Bulgaria, which, according
to these reports, does not wish to
participate in such a campaign unless
it promises something more than expulsion
of the allies from Saloniki. *
In Athens anxious thought Is being
given to the seizure of the consuls
representing Germany and her allies
at Saloniki. It is expected that so far
as Greece is concerned the incident
! will be closed with the ^release of the
consuls under safe conduct.
"While requesting some such action by
the entente powers, Greece also has
protested to Germany against the aeroplane
attack on Saloniki. Germany
and her allies denounce the arrest of
the consuls as a violation of international
law, while Bulgaria already has
retaliated by arresting they French
vice consul at Sofia.
Interview With Greek Xing.
The Athens correspondent of the
Daily Mail has had an interview with
King Constantine. whom he credits
with 'perfect honesty in his desire to
serve Hellenic, not German, interests,
and not to be drawn into the European
conflict. While he wishes to avoid a
quarrel with Germany, he desired to be
friendly with the allies and has no secret
understanding with Bulgaria.
The king, according to the correspondent,
says:
"There was never any reason for the
suspicion with which we were treated.
Unfortunately there were a number of
small differences with the French and
English, but, rest assured, we will do
all possible to bring: about a complete
understanding with the allies. We have
no desire but to. accord you every facility.
The possible umbrage which I
felt at some of your actions has quite
passed, as a result of the harmony prevailing
at Saloniki. I desire the
closest friendship with Great Britain,
but I will not be forced out of my neutrality,
which I shall maintain while I
am convinced that Greek interests are
best served thereby."
Thinks Allies Should Go.
The Athens correspondent of the
Daily Chronicle states in a dispatch
that the King of Greece told him he
could not understand what the entente
allies were supposed to be gaining in
remaining at Saloniki. The correspondent
quotes King Constantine as follows:
"1 could understand their presence so
long as there was a possibility of aiding
Serbia, but now that the object of
the mission has failed why remain? No
useful military, purpose is now to be
served. It is fairly obvious that if the
Anglo-French withdrew and sought a
fresh and more profitable field of operations
the armies of the central powers
would withdraw also and the sit
uation would solve Itself."
The king added, says the correspondent,
that he did not expect an offensive
by either side, and that therefore a
Balkan stalemate might reasonably be
expected.
King Peter of Serbia, who reached
Italy last week from Albania, is said
by 'fteuters Athens correspondent to
have arrived at Saloniki on a French
battleship. He was accompanied by
several Serbian ministers and officers.
Saloniki Attack Ordered.
BERLIN". January 3, via Lindon.?
The Morgen Post today publishes a report
that orders have been given to
the German and Austrian troops in
Serbia to advance into Greece and attack
the French and British. A
Bucharest dispatch to the Morgen
Post credits this statement to the Outro
of Sofla.
It )s said Germany has communicated
to Greece her desire to clear Grecian
territory of the entente allied forces.
The German minister at Athens, the
dispatch says, told Premier Skouloudis
the best Interests of Greece demanded
the removal of the French and British,
inasmuch as in the existing circumstances
Greece would be exposed
to danger from the troops of the central
powers, which have been ordered
to puraue the allies on Greek territory,
