puunoiin
'i. Three women delegates from Puu
nui district met this morning with the
city planning commission, to bring be
fore that body a plea for the extension
of Laimi road as an outlet into Nuuanu
valley in preference to the proposed
Circle Drive.
This .was the first meeting of the
planning commission for nearly a
month, weekly meetings' have been
abandoned during the holidays.' Most
of the time at this morning's seccion.
was given over to a discussion of the
Puunul improvement project as outlin
ed in the petition.
Several members of the commission
voiced the feeling that the alleged ob
jections to the improvement on the
part of George Sherman, a property
owner of large interests and also on
the part of the Country Club, cannot
rightly stand in the way of putting a
road through wherever deemed best
by most of the people.
Mrs.; J. G. Stokes stated that the
Puunul residents formerly used trails
to cross over into Nuuanu, but that
these had been abandoned when the
country club promised to build a road
through. Now, under a new set of of
cers, the road is being opposed, and
the ladies of the Outdoor Circle have
been put off with numerous delays.
A special committee was appointed
by the chair to look into the whole
matter together with the road commit
tee of the supervisors who are already
giving It consideration. v i
In the future meetings will not be
held as often as they have been in
the past, according to a decision this
morning. Regular -meeting will be
held monthly, but special meetings
may be called at aay time. The first
Monday in the month has been set as
the date of meeting.

Filipino immigration to Hawaii may
be strengly opposed in the national ad

result of statements in the annual re
port of A. Caminetti, commissioner
general of immigration. .
iHIs report, received from Washing

made several months ago that "Anleri
canization of Hawaii is'; not making
substantial progress." He further de
clares, after; mentioning the various
immigrant factors, "it is doubtful
whether it R advisable to permit any
large number of Filipinos to enter Ha
wail."
After considerable discussion of Ori
ental immigration, during which he
raises the question whether there
should not be legislation against the
"picture bride" system, he says, under
the head of "Immigration from Insular
United States":
"It will be observed that, in addition
to the 15,512 aliens shown by the said
table as presented last year to have
come to continental from insular
United States during the seven years
covered. 2437 have entered in the past

The navy department has received
the ' complete report of the salvage
operations in connection with the : U.
S. S. F-4, and it abounds in thrilling
tales of self-sacrificing courage and
devotion to duty on the part of the officers-
and enlisted men. Secretary
Daniels has commended the command
ing officers and crews of the U. S. S.
Maryland, F-l, F-2 and F-3 and the
commandant and men of the naval sta
tion at Hawaii for their valuable aid
in this work, and has commended
Lieut Charles E. Smith, Lieut Kirby
B. Crittenden and Chief Gunner
George D. Stillson for their excellent
work and untiring zeal. Naval Con
structor Julius A. Furer has also been
commended for his ingenuity in utiliz
ing the meager apparatus at hand for
the salvage operations and the ideas
put forth by him, in designing the re
mainder. When Chief Gunner's Mate
William F. Loughman was brought to
the surface after being rescued by
Chief Gunner's Mate Frank W. Crilley
he was almost jdead. and it was only
through the skill of P. AV Surg. Han-v
A; Garrison and 'P. A. Surg. George R.

to life. These officers, with no
thought of tlie great danger to them
selves, entered the decompression
tank with Loughman and stayed with
him until he could safely be removed.
He was then turned over to Sura
Holton C: Curl, of the V. S. S. Mary
land, through whose skill and care
Loughman was kept alive. . Scrtflrv
