By United Press. s
LONDON, Jan. 3. Tho steamer
Glengyle was submarined. It was an
nounced by the admiralty today.
The firHt dispatch that was received
hero aid about one hundred survivors
had been picked up. It Is believed
that several lives were lost though' no
definite reports are yet available.
With the exception of the Lusitania
and the Arabc, thg Glengyle was the
largest British vessel that has been
a war victim. It had nine thousand
tons displacement and presumably
carried a large crew.
Shortly after the news of the sink
ing of the Glengyle was received, came
the word that the Japanese steamer
Kankon Mara had been torpedoed.
Reports say tho members of the crew
were saved.
When the destruction of the Glen
gyle was first announced the ad
miralty was making every effort to
ascertain further details In regard to
the sinking of the Irtish liner Persia,
with the loss of about two hundred
lives.
It Is understood that several more
shipping firms will announce the sus
pension of sailings through the Suez
canal within twenty-four hours as a
result of the increasing activity of sub
marines in waters adjacent to that
point. It Is predicted that Insurance
rates on shipping throuph the Medi
terranean will bo raised to a point
that will make It prohibitive.
The Glengyle, although ordinarily a
freighter, carried some passengers. A
dispatch from Malta says all of the
passengers were landed and that the
only missing are members of the
"WILSON DOCTRINE" ON
SUB. WARFARE COMING
By I'nited Tress.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3. President
Wilson's next statement on submarine
warfare will likely be a message ad
dressed to the world, containing an
announcement of tho "Wilson doc
trine" regarding the rights of Amer
icans the world over.
Technically, it is understood, this
doctrine may be embodied in a mes
sage to Germany or Austria, but it
will be intended for all other nations,
particularly Bulgaria and Turkey.

Persia Survivors Tell It.
By United Press.
ALEXANDRIA, Egypt, Jan. 3. The
surviving officers of the liner Persia,
who landed here declare positively
that the steamer was torpedoed. They
ridicule the idea that a mine sent the
liner to the bottom, with the losa o
over two hundred lives.
The second officer of the Persia said
he saw the wake of the torpedo on the
port side of the vessel just before the
explosion came. No survivors , were
found, however, who said they saw
the submarine.
"There was no panic on board," said
Leonard Moss, a British survivor.
"The heavy loss of life was due to the
fact that the Persia sank within less
than six minutes and that most of the
passengers were at luncheon at the
time."
' Warships and fishing vessels are re
ported to be searching off Crete for
bodies of those lost on the Persia. It
is believed possible that some of the
passengers may have remained afloat
long enough to be rescued by Greek
trawlers.

BIG NEWS TOLD TO YOU
FIRST BY DAILY EXPRESS
Emperors, statesmen, warriors and
a staff of newspaper correspondents
circling the globe, have worked to
gether in the columns of the Daily Ex
press during the last twelve months
to make 1915 the most wonderful year
for news in the history of journalism.
Through the Vnited Press, the Daily
Express has been enabled to tap the
European war areas, the orient and
domestic field for exclusive news
throughout the year. The list of cor
lespondonts who have given the Daily
Express its brilliant stories of the war,
is headed by Ed L. Keen, the Euro
pean manager of the Vnited Press.
Among those associated with him
have been William G. Shepherd at
various battle fronls; William Philip
Sinims in Paris, Carl W. Ackerman in
Berlin, Henry Wood in Rome and
southeastern Europe, Wilbur S. For
rest in London, Charles P. Stewart
with the Ford peace expedition and
ethers.
Starting ahead of all rival news re
ports last New Year'3 day with the
story of the destruction of the British
battleship Fprmidable, the Daily Ex
press has received over the Vnited
Press wires during 1915 a continuous
stream of similarly exclusive stories.
When the Russians were finally
driven out of East Prussia last winter,
it was the Daily Express and the
Vnited Press that had the story of the
titanic struggle in the northern snows.
When Count Zeppelin felt the time
had come to defend his air raiding
monsters, he did so through the Daily
Express and the Vnited Press, Dr. von
Bethman Hollweg, the German chan
cellor, made the same selection to an
nounce to the world after the fall of
Warsaw, what Germany was still
fighting for. The prime minister of
Bulgaria, through the Daily Express
and the Vnited Press proclaimed Bul
garia's final terms for intervention in
the war just before German diplomacy
won its victory at Sofia.
The fall of the French ministry, the
finding of the body of Daniel Froh
man, the description of the first Zep
pelin raid over the heart of London,
the story of the war's first battle be
tween submarines and the Bulgarian
attack on the American flag at Mon
astir are a few other events of the
last year the Daily Express through
the Vnited Press, was able to give its
readers in advance of its rivals.
Count Okunia, the Japanese pre
mier, sent to the Daily Express over
its Vnited Press wire, exclusively its
story of Japan's ultimatum to China
concerning the readjustment of inter
national relations in the Orient.
Nearer home, John D. Rockefeller
told of his objections to the Anglo
French war loan in an exclusive
Vnited Press story to the Daily Ex
press. Over the Washington wire of
Hie Vnlled Press, the Daily Express
was Informed of William J. Divan's

U - '.H',?V 4 ill
reasons for seigning as secretary of
state long before the news was known
elsewhere.
So throughout the year the Vnited
Press wires have brought to inn
Daily Express beat after beat and
scoop succeeding scoop.
Many people do not seem to under
stand the method by which world
news is gathered and distributed
through the medium of cables and
telegraph wires, and a short explana
tion may therefore be in order.
"Where did you get that?" is a ques
tion that is often asked when the
Daily Express prints a piece of big
news ahead of the morning papers
that reach Chickasha the next day.
The answer is, "The Daily Express
buys it and buys it every day from
the Vnited Press Association," a large
concern that makes a business of get
ting news and distributing it The
Vnited Press has correspondents in all
parts of the world and it supplies
daily news for over five hundred after
noon papers, large and small, in the
Vnited States and Canada., The
Vnited Press is one of several mu
news-gathering agencies and it de
votes Us energies exclusively to the
service of afternoon paper's. It has
correspondents not only in foreign
lauds, but also in every state in the
union, and their duty is to get the
news as soon as possible after the
event happens. The newg which the
Express prints originates after the
morning papers in the larger cities
have gone to press and is therefore
distinctly the "news of today." Owing
to the difference in time between this
country and Europe, the Daily Ex
press, going to press about 3:30
o'clock in the afternoon is often able
to print news that "breaks" in Lon
don late in the afternoon or early ln
the evening.
A good illustration of how the Daily
Express prints the news first occurred
last Saturday when the story of the
sinking of the British liner Persia was
told before you read it in any other
paper. The same thing happens every
day. Whenever you see a news story
in the Daily Express marked "By
Vnited Tress," you may be assured
that it Is news never before printed.
This news service costs the Daily Ex
press considerable money and it ss
cost more f ince the war began on ac
count of the largo additional expense
to the United Press of putting war
correspondents in the field.

he spent his early boyhood. Forty
five years ago he moved to Dallas,
Texas, at which time that city was
only a small town. After a short resi

to Fort Worth, where he engaged In
the commission business. While in
Fort Worth he was married to Emma
Alice Thornton, Dec. 18, 1S7S. Four
children were born from this union.
Claude Thornton, William Henry,

LONG LAD
IS SLASHED
BY LILLARD
Shortly before 9 o'clock Sunday
night, an altercation between two 17-year-old
boys resulted in the stabbing
of Carl Long by J. T. Lillard.
Long was taken to his home at 720
Choctaw avenue and Dr. Downey
called in to dress the wound, a stab
just above the left hip. Information
given out at the Chickasha hospital
this morning stated that Long's wound
would not prove serious unless unfore
seen complications should arise.
Lillard, after the cutting surren
dered to Officers Boles and Tuck, and
was held at the central police station
until this morning, when he was
turned over to the sheriff's officers.
Appearing before Judge Moore this
morning, arrangements were made tp
investigate the charges against Lil
lard this afternoon, at which time it
is thought the wounded boy will be
able to appear in court.
According to the statement which
Lillard 13 said to have made at the
police station last evening, he was es
corting Miss Ella Munson home from
the Second Baptist church when the
trouble arose. He stated he warned
Long and a number of other boys who
were teasing him, to desist, and to let
him alone and that, when Long per
sisted ln annoying htm, he drew the
weapon, a plain pocket knife from his
hip pocket and made one "swipe" at
Long, inflicting the stab wound as
charged in the information which was
filed a-jninst him by the county attor
ney this- morn In sr.
ests of this community, but was at
the same time an earnest, active
leader in the First Baptist church of
the city, having united with the
church early in life. Mr. Sigmon was
a man of exemplary habits, of strong
personal convictions, never hesltaiiu
to take the initiative in what he
deemed to be just and honorable. By
his upright moral life and his high
conception of business principles, he
contributed much to the uplift of hiu
adopted city.
The business which has grown and
prospered under Mr. Sigmon's direc
tion, will be conducted by his son, C.
T. Sigmon, vice-president and junior
member of the firm.
Jules Sigmon, the only Mviu6
brother of the deceased, arrived in
Chickasha from Morristown, Tenn.,
Saturday morning on the Firefly, Just
in time for his brother to recognize
him and tell him he was glad he was
here. He had just 30 minutes to catch
the train after receiving the message
which summoned him here. Fouf sis
ters survive the deceased, three living
in Morristown and tho other in Lub
bock, Texas, but illness in their fam
ilies preventd thm from bingte
ilies prevented them from being here.
Other out-of-town relatives here for
the funeral were Mrs. Cal Sigmon of
Bowie, Texas; Mr. and Mrs. Howard
Sandridge, Mr. and Mrs. Herman Sig
mon, Mr. and Mrs. Whitney of Fort
Worth; H. C. Seitz and family of Okla
homa City, and Mrs. Bennifield, Lone

ROME, Jan. 3. When the orches
tral guns have boomed their last snivo
and the big asbestos curtain of pea;-
drops on Europe's war-torn stage,
aoubtless the world will begin to ap
preciate the role played by King
Victor in the greatest tragedy of his
tory. Act II was well under way before
Italy joined the players and King
Victor with his tuft of rooster feather
appeared from the wings. He had fre
quently been mentioned in the lines,
and no sooner had he strode upon the
stage than he and the veteran actor
Franz Joseph came to blows.
"Verona will fall before Gorilla,"
shouted the Austrian.
"Gorizla first," retorted Victor and
the play went on.
"It was not until May of last year
that Italy declared war on Austria.
Immediately the Italian general staff
outlined the following land program:
1. An aggressive, systematic oper
ation on the mountainous northnj
frontier, Trentino and the Carnic
Alps long fortified by Austria, de
signedly to make an Austrian Invasion
of Italy easy while standing impreg
nable against Italian Invasion.
2. An offensive on a large scale
against the valley of the Isonzo which
barred Italy's way toward the Julian
Alps on the east and the Istrian penln
aula to the south.
The naval program was this: De
struction of Austrian commerce a
the Adriatic and adjacent waters and
the bottling up or destruction of the
Austrian fleet.
On land today Italy faces the New
Year as the only one of the Allied
Powers whose main army Is firmly
entrenched on the soil of an enemy.
On water the Duke of Abruizi's fleet
is supreme. The Austrian main fleet,
refuged in Pola harbor, refused the
Italian challenge Just as the German
fleet defies the British in the Kiel
canal. Like Germany, Austria is un
able to give safe convoy to her own
commerce.
With an army of more than 2,230,000
men in uniform; with reserves of
1,750,000 men between 18 and 3S yet
to be called to the colors; with abun
dant equipment, especially heavy -tiliery;
backed by a splendid indus
trial mobilization capable of feedine
munitions for any emergency, Italy
looks to the future with the ntmost
confidence. This feeling was vivUllv
reflected in the recent utterances of
Baron Sonnino, minister of foreign af
fairs, in the chamber, In which b an
r.ounced not only Italy's agreement
with the allies not to conclude a sep
arate peace, but her purpose to extend
J the campaign aenws the Adriatic iu
support of stricken Serbia.
, In answer to the latter pledge,
50.000 Italian troops have already
landed In Albania where pioneers am
busy at road-building and other means
of transport through the pathless
mountains. Food and clothing by the
shipload are being sent by the Italians
for the Serbian refugees.
Seven months of fighting along the
lines of the general staff's plan
campaign have produced far greater
results than tho dally cammunlques
have indicated. On tho Inonzo front
the offensive has reached the stase
where an Italian occupation of the fn
tire Istrian peninsula, as well an ef-
