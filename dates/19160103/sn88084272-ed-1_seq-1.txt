ASHIXGTOX. D. C, Jan 3.
Food prices in the United
States during 1914 were high
er than at any time during the last
J7 years with the exception of the
years 1881, when they were four per
cent higher than 1914 prices, 1S83 when
they were on the same level, and in
1912 when they were one per cent high
er. The Bureau of Labor statistics, in
its annual bulletin just issued on
wholesale prices of commodities, re
viewing the years from I860 to 1914
discloses that in the 55 years food
prices were highest in 1S64, when they
were 76 per cent more than 1914 prices,
and lowest in 1S96 when they were 40
per cent below.
In the years of the civil war. and
during a dozen years or more afterward l
prices of all commodities were the hicb
est since I860, .when the first attempt
was made at keeping a record of whole
sale prices. In 1864 prices of most com
modities reached their highest point.
Lowest prices were recorded in the
years from 1S94 to 1898.
The effect of the European war on
wholesale prices in the United States
is not fully disclosed in the report, as
prices for only the first five months
of the war are recorded. Comparison
of civil war prices with those prevail
ing in this country during the Euro

Tnro Offensives Clash.
In other dispatches it is asserted
that two great offensive actions clashed,
the Russians having advanced as a
threat against the Teutons in their
Balkan operations, while the Austrians
and Germans felt the necessity of im
proving their positions against the at
tack expected from Gen. Ivanoff early
in the spring.
Whatever may b' the facts, there is
no doubt that the result of these op

censorship to be established in time
of war over all publications and means
of communication. The report further
buggests:
"That such a measure, after approv

deem proper. Regulations should In
