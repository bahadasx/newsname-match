In view of these admitted circum

the details of the sinking of the An
cona. the weight and character of the
additional testimony corroborating the
admiralty's report, and the number of
Americans killed or injured are in no

The culpability of the commander is
in any case established, and the un
disputed fact, is that citizens of the
United States were killed. Injured or
put in jeopardy by his lawless act
The rules of international law and
the principles of humanity which were
thus wilfully violated by the command

the act of its naval commander and to
