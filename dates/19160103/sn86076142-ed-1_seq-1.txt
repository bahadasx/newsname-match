cause of the great need for metal in
making munitions of war, and Chin
ese, who were far-sighted enough to
corner antimony output, have reaped
a fortune.
The refuted metal has been sold In
London for oer J00 gold per ton at
times since the opening of the war.
Previous to hostilities the London
price was about 9125.
Hunan province, which lies south
of Hankow, is the chief, antimony pro
ducing section of the world. The ore
from which the metal Is obtained is
blasted there from the hilltops, and
reaches Hankow on fivers which drain
Into the Yaugtse. The chief producer
of the retined ore lis the Hau Ch'ang
company of Changsha. Changsha Is
an Important commercial center on
the Slang river, south of Hankow. Be
fore the war the output of the Haung
Ch'ang company's refinery averaged a
little more than two hundred tons a
month, but the plant has now been
extended and the company has opened
offices In New York.
Several plants have now-been es
tabllshed In Hankow for refining the
ore, and this city Is probably supply

by the munition workers. The melul

ELKS USHER IN THE GLAD NEW

FRIVOLITY
There have been parties and parties,
and there have been Elks' parties and
Elks' parties, but the Elks' New-Year's
eve party, Friday night, stands in a
clans by itself, at least so say all
those who participated In It. By na
ture It waB a yama yama party and
the home was taxed to its utmost ca
pacity, despite the inclement weather
and the fact that there were several
other parties.
Dancing was Indulged In till almost
12 o'clock, when the committee dis
pensed a variety of noise making de
vices with which the guests proceeded
to mine the roof. Several thousand
yards of serpentine, were also dis
tributed, and the effect was quite
spectacular.
The surprise of the evening was
sprung, however, when the commiteee
having the affair in charge invited all
to partake of a delicious hot lunch,
after which- dancing was again in
dulged In till 2 o'clock.
All agreed that If a reception
amounts to anything, little '16 must
have felt flattered.

ENED PNEUMONIA
Frank Perkins, one of the Jurymen
in thetrial of the county commission
ers, as prosecuting witnesses, versus
W. W. Booth on the charge of criminal
libel, was taken very ill late yester
day afternoon with symptoms of pneu
monia. rtiyKlcians were summoned
by the bailiff in charge of the Jury
and It was found that the unfortunate
juryman should be removed to the
hospital. The district attorney and
Milton M. Detch, counsel for the de'
fendant, held a conference and Mr.
Detch said: "Of course, I am in fa
vor of having the man taken to the
hospital." This was done by stipu
lation, the attorneys finding it impos
sible to raise Judge Walsh, who had
returned to his home at Goldfield, over
the telephone.
This morning Judge Walsh called
Dr. Cunnlgham to the stand. The
physician testified as to the juryman's
condition and expressed the opinion
thnt he would be sufficiently recov
ered to resume his duties Wednesday
nmi'tilng. The case then was con
tinued till Tuesday morning.
This is a very unfortunate matter,
because It delays the trial of this case
for at least two clays, with its at
tcnd.tnt cost upon the taxpayers.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 3. Arrange-
ments are being made for the funeral
of Joseph Rucker Lamar, associate
justice of the supreme court, who
died last night of heart disease. His
burial will take place Wednesday at
Augusta, Georgia. Secretary Lane
and Solicitor General John Davis are
mentioned as his possible successor.
Associate Justice Joseph Rucker
Lamar had the distinction of being
xme of the few members of the court
appointed by a president of opposite
political faith. President Taft appoint
ed him In 1910, with only two prece
dents for such action, those of Jus
tices Jackson and Lurton.
Justice Lamar was born in Ruckers
ville, Elbert county, Georgia, October
14, 1857. He attended the University
of Georgia and later Bethany college,
where he was graduated .In 1877. He
attended the law school at Washing
ton and Lee university, and was ad
mitted to the bar at Augusta, Ga., In
1878. He lived at Augusta until ap
pointed to the supreme court bench.
Coming from distinguished South
ern stock, he was one of the few men
whose family had previously had a
representative on the bench. The Jus
tice was a cousin to Associate Justice
L. Q. C. Lamnr, of Mississippi, who
served on the bench from 1888 to 1893.

"KEEP YOURSELVES IN THE LOVE

(Communicated)
At the Presbyterian church yester
day the heavy wind and snow was no
doubt the cause of slim attendance at
all the services.
Rather a bad beginning for the new
year, but we must take the weather
into consideration.
The morning subject was from the
text "Keep Yourselves In the Love
of God."
The lights went out about the mid
dle of the young peoples' meeting and
the rest of the meeting was held by
candle light.
The evening sermon was a New
Year's sermon.
NEVADA SHIPPING TUNGSTEN
CONCENTRATES TO THE EAST
According to figures secured by J.
M. Fulton of the Southern Pacific, Ne
vada tungsten mines are shipping
about six tons of high grade tungsten
concentrates daily to eastern markets,
The ore is being mined near Mina
by the Atking-Kroll company, which
probably is the largest shipper in the
state. At Ely several properties are
working and a mill to treat tungsten
ore was erected at Toy, a short dis
tance weBt of Lovelock, about two
months ago. The plant is shipping
three tons of concentrates daily, the
ore averaging In the neighborhood of
$2000 a ton.
An oven has been Invented to utllie
for baking the smoke and hot gases
that ordinarily would pass out of a
chimney from a residence heating
plant.

He was honored by his state by
many positions for wnich hia learn
ing and ability as a lawyer fitted him.
First he was a member of the Georgia
house of representatives, and in 1892
was appointed by the supreme court
of Georgia as one of the commission
ers to prepare a code of laws for the
state, which code was adopted by the
general asembly in 1895. He was again
honored on January 1, 1901, by ap
pointment to fill an unexpired term
as associate justice of the Georgia su
preme court and was elected to the
same position at the ensuing election.
In 1905, he resigned to resume the
practice of the law.
In the practice of the law, he large
ly represented railroads and other big
corporations, and, yet, in the day of
antipathy to coropation lawyers, his
integrity was so highly regarded that
the senate without delay confirmed
his nomination.
Coming to Washington as a man
little known beyond his state, his
rise In public estimation as a mem
ber of the court, led President Wilson '
to select him as the principal commis
sioner for the United States in the
ABC mediation at Niagara Falls In
1914, between the United States and
Mexico, over conditions In the south
ern republic. In this position' ho ac
quitted himself with distinction.
