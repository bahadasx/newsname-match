Oregon Second in
New R. R. Mileage
Fewer miles of railroad were built
In the United States during 1915
than In any other year since 1864,
and more miles of railroads were In
receivers' hands during the year than
ever before, according to railway sta
tistics compiled from official sources
by the Railway Age Gazette. There
have been only three other years
since 1858 In which the Increase In
railway mileage was less than 1,000
miles, and those were the Civil War
years 1861, 1862 and 1864.
In 1915 the total miles of new
railroad constructed in the United
States Were 933 as compared with
1,532 in 1914 and 3,071 in 1913.
The largest mileage of new road in
one state was built in Pennsylvania,
which constructed 98 miles. Oregon
was second with 83 miles, and Wash
ington third with 71 miles. Eleven
states built no new road at all. Can
adian roads built 718 miles of new
track as compared with 1,978 in
1914, while In Mexico 36.5 miles
were built as against none recorded
for 1914.
Oregon makes a good showing for
the past year, but should far eclipse
the amounf of 83 miles of newly con
structed railroad, In 1916. The Coos
Bay road will be completed, the
Grants Pass-Coast railroad will add
a few miles of track, the Roseburg
railroad to the proposed sawmills
will probably be well along, and
there Is an Imminent possibility of
the Strahorn eastern Oregon railroad
being partly built during the year. I

Fewer Rod and Gun
Licenses in 1915
For one or some of several reasons
the sportsman with rod and reel and
gun did not pay In the usual amount
of license money during the year
1915 for hunting and fishing licenses.
Either many have been too busy try
ing to make ends meet, or doing
nothing, to hunt or fish, or have not
had the required dollar, or the Hub
bard shooting episode and other oc
currences have satisfied the hunters
and fisheremen that a license is un
necessary. Despite the open seasons on pheas
ants and gray squirrels and the con
sequent increase in the number of
gunners, the number of licenses fell
off.
County Clerk Gardner has a record
of 2,595 licenses issued to gunners,
2,031 to fishermen, three to non
residents and 249 combination
licenses. The fees paid in for those
purposes amount to $5,154. This
total shows a decrease of $1,211 from
last year's receipts. It Is $1,447 less
than for the year 1913.
There were 83 old soldiers' licenses
Issued during the year. On them no
charge is made.
The great decrease in fishing
licenses is easily explainable in that
the Rogue river, the principal fishing
stream of the county, which is usual
ly a fisherman's delight, was almost
devoid of fish this year. The fisher
men state that this is due to the
commercial fishing at the mouth of
the Rogue. The commercial fisher
men, get practically all of the fish
which come Into the river. The
sportsmen of this part of the state
are up in arms against the commer
cial fishermen and expect do secure
legislation which will give the upper
valley one of its best assets, an ac
cessible river with the best fishing
on the coast.
Electric Company
Rushes Work on Dam
The California-Oregon Electric
Power Company, who are supplying
electric current, wholesale, to the
city of Ashland, has a force of men
working night and day on Its dam at
Copco, Cal., on the Klamath river, in
an endeavor to get all of the work
above the high water mark before the
spring rains cause the river to rise.
This . dam will he an Important
piece of engineering and will form an
Immense lake of hundreds of acres,
covering some valuable farms the
company" purchased from the resi
dents. It Is estimated the entire cost
of the work will be in the neighbor
hood of a million dolalrs.
The company is going into the
wholesale manufacture of current on
an immense scale and intends to en
large their plant to meet the demands
of all of northern California and
southern Oregon as necessary. Elec
tric motors are fast taking over the
burden of pumping water for Irriga
tion, running mills and all of the oth
er labors formerly periormea Dy

County Court Fixes 1915 Tax Levy
At 14 Mills After Making Changes
A committee from the Jackson
County Taxpayers' League formulat
ed a report regarding the proposed
county court's budget, submitted
their report to the directors of the
league, who in turn presented It to
the county court. The report Is
printed herewith. A numlfer of citi
zens and members "of the league ap
peared before the meeting of the
county court Thursday and pressed
changes In the proposed budget. The
court" received all suggestions with
good grace, and whenever the reduc
tions or changes were deemed feas
ible, made them. The total levy re
mains at 14 mills as advertised, but
several funds were red iced and the
amounts put in the. road fund, which

County, Ore.:
Gentlemen: Your special commit
tee of nine appointed to consider and
investigate the published budget
upon which the proposed 14-mill
county tax levy for the next year Is
based, reports as follows:
Your committee, after carefully
reviewing the budget, Invited the
county officials to meet with the
cpmmlUpn In order to furnish such
Information as might be desired by
the committee upon any Items of the
budget.' With the exception of the
county court, each county official re
sponded to the Invitation and very
frankly, courteously and satisfactor
ily gave facts and details In reply to
every inquiry made by the commit-
The information furnished Is that
the number of inmates in the county
home ranges from 27 to 31. On the
basis of 30 the total expense of the
farm averages $300 per Inmate per
year, being $25 per month, whereas
the state expense, we understand,
averages approximately $13 per
month, while In Douglas county $15
per month and no county farm. The
rpfllntennnce costs In money $300 per
year per inmate, not including the
salary list.'
The preseent farm Is taid to com
prise about 27 acres, the greater por
tion being f-rtile, of which over half

The committee believes a practical

Your special ctfmm'ttee. as far asj0f the food products needed for the
Inmates of the county home and save

maintenance the $200 per inmate.
Therefore, your committee specif

urged upon the county court with a
view of more reasonable economy In
the handling of county funds in con
nection with the county farm.
In the absence of an opportunity
to take up with the county court mat
cers relating to county expenditure,
it now understands the facts, calls
attention to certain Items In the bud

connection therewith, as follows:

ing of the city council last Thursday
as follows;
"Resolved, that we, In this the

dered by Mr. Cunningham covering
eight years of hard and faithful work
In the city's behalf.
"He has at all times used his high
ability and his best efforts In for

Bid Farewell To
Year and Saloons
The new year was ushered in.
very quietly in Ashland. Only two
church bells were ruug and the rail
road whistles, which generally awak
en the echoes with discordant blasts,
were silent. Several watch parties
were held, but the streets were quiet.
Someone Bhot off a couple of bunch
es of firecrackers and another wel
comed the baby year with a six
shooter. - No small proportion of the male
population journeyed to Medford Fri
day evening and bid farewell to the
saloons and the year 1915 together.
Medford witnessed quite a joyous
time, all of the liquor houses doini?
a mulling business and cleaning
most of their stocks. A celebration
at the .Medford hotel claimed most of
the elite of Medford and a number
of the clawhammer set from Ashland.
Throughout Oregon the goiiig of
the saloons was marked with hilarity.

We have received from tht officials

the official catalogue of the recent
exposition. According to the live
stock men, this Is, the first time a
catalogue showing awards has ever
been issued by any livestock show
and received the thorough apprecia
tion of breeders and exhibitors.
Attendance this year approached
50,000, every one of whom was there
with the' idea of getting something
out of the show. The next year's
show will be open December 4-9, and
already the directors are planning to
make it even better than the past ex
position. 1 ;' ' ! !"
A number of valley cattlemen at
tended the show and brought back
glowing reports of the high class of
exhibits and the-completflness or the
arrangements. Numerous purchases
of high grade atoek were made. ' '
Newsdealers and magazine dealers
In Ashland will have to spend several
merry hours with the scissors or face
chances of a heavy fine. The selling
of publications carrying liquor adver
tisements will make the seller liable
to a fyie of from $100 to $500, and
throughout the state newsdealers are
preparing to carefully clip all liquor
ads from the papers and periodicals
which they handle. Oregon must not
only "cut out the booze," but must
cut out the booze ads.
That part of the Oregon law that
affects the newsdealers is found in
section 8, which reads:
"If any person shall advertise or
jve notice by signs, billboards, news
papers, periodicals, or otherwise, for
himself or another of the sale or
keeping for sale of liquors, or shall
circulate or distribute any price lists,
circulars or order blanks advertising
liquors, or publjsh any newspaper,

or printed papers In which such ad
vertisements or notices are given, or
shall permit any such notices, or any
advertisements ot liquors (including
billboards) to be posted upon his
premises, or premises under his con
trol, or shall permit the same to so
remain upon such premises, he shall
be guilty of a misdemeanor and be
fined not less than $100 nor more
than $500." '

taxpayers might easily ascertain who
are receiving county help In their re
spective localities, would prove very
advantageous in several ways, and
result in saving to the county a con
siderable part of said $9,000.
Jailor mid Janitor.
This committee believes the jailor
has sufficient time to properly care
for the oounty buildings, as Janitor.
The law Is said to fix the salary of
jailor at $50 per month. For years
both jail and Janitor work was done
by one person, and up to some two
or three years ago. Douglas county
has this plan and salary is $70 per
month. Therefore, it Is recommend
ed that the offices of Jailor and jan
itor be consolidated, and that the
county pay a salary of $75 per fionth
to the Jailor for Jail and Janitor
work.
Fruit. Inspectors.
Your committee Is not satisfied
that the county is receiving proper
value for the expenditure of $0,000
for fruit inspectors. It Is essential
to properly safeguard the fruit in
terests of this county, but unneces
sary or Improper expense items are
believed to have been frequently al
lowed In this department during past
years. U also appears to this com
mute that a lack of Intelligent plan
ning of the work and a reasonable
energy and economy In doing the
work may In all fairness be made
against this department. Further
more, your committee Is Inclined to
believe that, some items of expense
in this department, at least, have
been approved without sufficient
care, resulting in unnecessarily large
expenditures. . It is suggested by this
committee that greater efficiency be
exacted in the expenditure of the
fruit inspection fund.
Schools and Supervisors.

mlttee to express any disapproval of
certain appointments made by tha
superintendent, It certainly is proper
for' the committee tb state that it la
Impressed with the Idea that two su
pervisors at a cost of $2,500 in tha
budget are inadvisable. This conclu
sion is based on two reasons, anions
others:
First, that the superintendent
deems It unnecessary for him to visit
the schools In his fixed field, even
though required by law so to do, be
cause of these two supervisors, ami
so does not give his personal atten
tion to them.
Second, because your committee is)
not convinced the practical work:
done by the supervisors Is really
wortir $2,500 more to the county
than could be done by the superin
tendent himself if he would person
ally keep in touch with those teach
ers whom he deems specially In neei
of counsel and advice in their school
work.
The committee hastens to express)
Its satisfaction that Superintendent
Wells has planned to conduct hist
county school work with but one su
pervisor after July next. The com
mittee believes $2,500 to be too large
an item for supervisors and urges a
reduction.
Attention Is called to the law
which requires the appointment by
the superintendent of at least one
supervisor; which law also provides
that if a supervisor is uudeiired, the
county districts may, by. petition ot
the trustees ot a majority of such .
districts, secure the discontinuance . .
