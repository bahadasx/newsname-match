Work Ahead Before Local

TREASURY OFFICIALS
ANXIOUS FOR START
Citizens Satisfied Over Government's
Selection Was Not Expected
for Some Time.
(By Special Correspondent.)
Washington, Jan. 3.Treasury of
ficials today told a representative of
the Bemidji Daily Pioneer that they
were anxious to get the work on the
new Federal building at Bemidji,
Minn., started as soon as possible.
The site has been selected at Sixth
and Beltrami avenue and the price
paid the Townsite company for the
lots is $6,000.
The remaining $66,000 will be ap
propriated when the supervising ar
chitect is ready to begin work.
This, however, will not be for some
months because of the press of work.
The delay, hfowever, will be only
that, which is usual.
The citizens of Bemidji were very
much surprised by the exclusive an
nouncement in the Daily Pioneer of
Friday of the flection of the Fed
eral building site in Bemidji. It was
believed here that the matter was not
that far advanced and that it would
perhaps be months before the situa
tion was settled. The selection^ came
as an excellent New Year's gift for
the city.
That the government has made the
best choice possible and satisfactory
to everyone is evident from the street
corner discussions during the past few
days. Everyone is expressing much
satisfaction over the selection of the
Jte. ,v.:
The site selected is Block Gj-iLots
13 to IS, and is directly across.from
the court house.
The Pioneer has had a special cor
respondent in Washington, through
Lithe i
s%k to^^^^
ments in the site sMuationJ ^|t Jwtll
continue from time to time to receive
articles oh the. advancement of the
work on the plans of the new build
ing.
Some of the expressions of Bemidji
business men today in regard to the
-selection of the site are as follows:
J. J. Opsahl"I am very-" glad the
matter is settled. I am sure that
everyone -w+W be very much satis-
fied."
W. L. Brooks"I have always
thought that the site selected was the
best location for the new Federal
building."
H. C. Baer"The city is to be con
gratulated over the wise selection of
the government. It has made a care
ful choice."
E. A. Barker"It's great. Be
midji has much to accomplish now
this year. A new Federal building,
a new armory and a new normal
school are much to look forward to."
E. F. Netzer"The selection of
the site is alright."
Attorney H. L. Huffman"The
site is fine. Could not be better."
GITY COUNCIL IN
SESSION TONIGHT
The city council will meet in reg
ular session at the city hall tonight.
Routine matters will be considered.

ment consisted of one full carload,
or seven cars. This is the first in

SCOO
THE CUB
REPORTER
TO OPEN MUD LAKE
BOTTOM FOR ENTRY
Federal land Office Prepares
Patent 8,000 Acres of Red
lake Land.
to
Washington, Jan. 3.The general
land office has announced that in the
neighborhood of 8,000 acres of Min
nesota land will be opened for entry
and settlement this comping spring.
The lands in question are a part
of the Red Lake Indian reservation
known as Mud Lake buttom, in Mar
shall county, and whatever proceeds
accrue from the opening, if it takes
place, will go to the Indian fund.
Plans Hitched Before.
This is not the first time, however,
that the interior department has an
nounced its intention of opening these
lands andjhen for some reason failed
to carry out its expressed intention.
Twice before similar announcements
have been made, but some hitch pre
vented the opening.
Until drainage operations carried
off the water, Mud Lake bottom was
not an agricultural section, but was a
body of water somewhat known to
local fame in Minnesota as good fish
ing and hunting grounds. Lands
along the banks had been patented to
various owners, legally designated as
"riparian owners."
For Indian Fundsr
When he lands were drained,
squatters- appeared on the drained
portions, and .disputes arose between
the'ripariah owners and the squatters
as to title.
The land office says that the attor
ney general's opinion holds that the
drained portions should be disposed of
for the benefit of the Indian funds.
If the. lands arg: opened Jthis spring,
the prospect for a litigation between
the riparian owners and those who
would claim the drained land under
government patents are very bright.,

Austrian fleet.
On Enemy's Soil.
On land today Italy faces the New
Year as the only one of the Allied
powers whose main army is firmly
entrenched on the, soil of an enemy.
On water the Duke of Abruzzi's fleet
is supreme. The Austrian main
fleet, refuged in Pala harbor, re
fused the Italian challenge just as
the German fleet deflies the British
the Kiel canal. Like Germany,
Austria is unable to give safe con
voy to her own commerce.
With an army of more than 2,250,-
000 men in uniform, with reserves of
1,750,000 men between 18 and 38 yet
to be called to the colors^ with abun
dant equipment, especially heavy ar
tillery, backed up by a splendid in
dustrial mobilization capable of feed
ing munitions for any emergency,
Italy looks to the future with the ut
most confidence. This Jfeeling was
vividly reflected in the recent utter
ances of Baron Sonnino, minister of
foreign affairs, in the chamber, in
which he announced not only Italy's
agreement with the Allies not to con
clude a separate peace, but her pur
pose to extend the campaign across
the Adriatic in support of stricken
Serbia.
Troops in Albania.
In answer to the latter pledge,
50,000 Italian troops jiave already
landed in Albania where pioneers are
busy at road-building and other
means of transport through the path
less mountains. Food and clothing
by the shipload are being sent by the
Italians for the Serbian refugees.
Seven months of fighting along the
lines of the general staff's plan of
campaign have produced far greater
results than the daily- commiquss
have indicated. On the Isonzo front
the offensive has reached the stage
where an Italian occupation of the
entire Istrian peninsula, as well as

Officials and Militia Day of -y--
Sorrow.
St. Paul, Minn., Jan. 3.The still
ness of death was on St. Paul this
afternoon. The capitol had just paid
its last respects to W. S. Hammond,
Minnesota governor who dropped
dead while looking after land in the
south. The body was taken to St.
James at noon.
During the 48 hours that the body
of the late chief lay in the rotunda
the state capitol, 25,000 people of
viewed the remains. The rotunda had
been converted into a bower of flow
ers, solemnly contrasted against the
mourning that festooned the entire
capitol.
At 9:30" this morning, Dr. H. ,C,
Swearingen, pastor "of the House of
Hope church, made his way through"
the bowers of flowers to the neat but
inauspicious casket in which lay the
remains of the late governor. His
funeral oration was short. Although
the attendance at the services in the
pitol was limited, thousands stood
outside and others lined the way of
the funeral procession to the Union
dep'ot. The mayors and city councils
of Minneapolis and St. Paul wire
among those inside the building.
Slowly the crowd gave way and the
active pallbearers took charge of the
casket. These were all sergeants.
They were Sergeants J. C. Giffordi'-G^
H. Tipler, R. H. Snure, '"&% NewS
bearer, J. J. Freeman, R. Reed^ H:
Cresse and E. Buruski. As the- first
regiment of the Minnesota Nationaf
Guard cleared the way,- these -men
slowly lifted the casket and carried it
to a caisson draped in the stars and
stripes.
Through sorrowing crowds that
lined the streets to the union depot,
the remains were borne, guarded by
27 militia raent and^pTacfefhaboard

Governor Burnquist officially des
ignated today as a day of mourning
throughout Minnesota.
TO APPOINT NETHAWAY.
St. Paul, Minn., Jan. 3.As a last
tribute to W. S. Hammond, whose
remains were buried at St. James to
day, it was reported that Governor
Burnquist will not appoint a success
or to Judge P. H. Stolberg, Chisago
county. Stolberg died two weeks
ago. It was reported today that
Hammond had planned on placing J.
C. Nethaway in the place. Burn
quist is expected to simply follow the
plans of Hammond.

Minister Reviews life of Man Whom
State Was Proud of Burial at
Mount Hope.
St. James, Minn., Jan. 3.All Min
nesota stood still this afternoon, as
all that was mortal remaining of W.
S. Hammond, late governor.of Min
nesota, was lowered beneath six feet
of snow and earth. Thousands at
tended the funeral services here.
The special train bearing the body
of the late executive arrived this af
ternoon. The remains were immedi
ately taken to the Methodist Episco
pal church where-
they laid in state
for half an hour. 'The Methodist
Episcopal is the largest church edi
fice in St. James, but -it proved en
tirely too small for the immense
crowd that gathered.
.-All business was suspended' and
schools were dismissed today. Su
preme court judges and officials of
the state house were given seats in
the church directly behind the seats
of the family of the decedent.
Rev. H. W. Fisher", Presbyterian
minister here, delivered the funeral
oration. The late executive was a
Presbyterian.- While all Watonwan
county stood with tear stained eyes
inthe church or near it, the minis
ter detailed the life of the decedent,
of whom St. James was proud. He
told of the coming of Hammond to
JMankato, Minn., as a young man. His
.study=for the law profession was de
tailed. Then "his opening: of a law
office., here and becoming" a member
ofe-the firm, of Farmer & Hammond
was mentioned.
How the governor loved birds and
children how he worked for- the
church and took a vital interest in
total abstinence, were things the min
ister discussed.v As the choir in

FRIEND OF DEAF CHILDREN.
St. Paul, Minn., Jan. 3.Parents
of deaf children through the state
were probably among the most touch
ed by the death and funeral today
of W. S. Hammond, late governor of
Minnesota. Hammond became inter
ested in the little deaf son of Mr.
and Mrs. H. O. Schultz of St. James.
When he-became governor he imme
diately gave his influence to the pas
sage of a bilf permitting deaf chil
dren to get state care without going
to the state school at Faribault.
MAKES WIDOW HAPPY.
St. Paul, Minn., Jan. 3.While
the entire state of Minnesota today
paid deference to the funeral of W.
S. Hammond, Minnesota's late gov
ernor, the heart of an aged widow in
Clinton, La., today overflowed with
gratitude for the big Minnesotan.
Hammond held a mortgage on the
aged widow's plantation. He visited
her while in the south. Fears that
he had come to foreclose the mort
gage were dispelled when he told her
to continue to live on the plantation
of 900 acres, and never mind the in
terest or principal of the loan.
POLITICAL POT BOILS.
St. Paul, Minn., Jan. 3.With the
burial of W. S. Hammond, late Min
nesota governor, at St. James today,
Minnesota's political pot began to
boil. Previous to the governor's de
mise, it was generally hinted that
Hammond on the Democratic ticket
would oppose J. A. A. Burnquist,
Hammond's lieutenant, on the Repub
lican ticket. The suddeii elevation
of Burnquist to governor, it is claim
ed in Republican/ circles, will
strengthen the candidacy of Burn
quist for a full term as chief of the
state.
