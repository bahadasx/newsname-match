NEW CRISIS TO
BE MET BY 11. S.
President Starts for Washing
ton to Take Charge of Sit
uation Caused by Sink
ing of the Persia.
CABLE TO PENFIELD
Loss of American Life and
Added Destruction of the
Glengyle Creates Grave
Problem.
Washington, Jan. 3. The new inter
national crisis brought on by the Teu
tonic submarine campaign in the
Mediterranean moved forward swiftly
today.
President Wilson has cut short his
honeymoon at Hot Springs, Va and
will leave there tonight, arriving in
the capital early tomorrow to take
personal charge of the situation.
Charge Makes Plea.
Baron Zwiedinek, charge of the Aus
trian embassy, assured Secretary Lan
sing that it should be found that an
Austrian submarine sunk the Persia
with loss of American life, his gov
ernment would promptly give repara
tion and satisfaction. He asked that
judgment be suspended until all the
facts were known.
The state department instructed
Ambassador Penfield at Vienna to
make inquiries for information to de
termine the nationality of the subma
rine and develop the facts in the
case.
Consuls Gathering Information.
Consuls and consular agents in the
vicinity of Alexandria were instruct
ed to gather affidavits from the Per
sia survivors and any others which
might throw light on the situation.
The fact that the Persia mounted
one gun was disclosed in a dispatch
from American Consul Garrels at
Alexandria, What effect that will
have on the situation, however, can
not be definitely determined until it
is determined whether tho gun was
mounted for offense or defense.
Situation Considered Critical.
Everywhere in Washington in offi
cial and diplomatic circles and at the
capital, where congress re-assembles
tomorrow after the holiday recess,, the
situation was viewed as most critical
and fraught with grave eventualities.
Chairman Stone of the senate for
eign relations' committee conferred
with Secretary Lansing at the sec
retary's invitation, but was non-committal
about the visit. Senator Stone
admitted that the submarine crisis
had been discussed and that he ex
pected to confer with President Wil
son on the latter's return tomorrow.
PIo said he did not know whether the
ciisls would be considered by the for
eign relations' committee "Just yet."
There seemed to be a growing im
pression in official quarters that to
morrow the president may call the
congress leaders together and ac
quaint them fully with the situation.
Hurrying President Home.
Although the best railroad officials
at Hot Springs couia ao was to suin
the president home tonight, . White
House officials asked the railroad
officials to start the president from
Clifton Forge, Va., for Washington
this afternoon, calculating that the
president could travel from Hot
Springs to Clifton Forge, less than
fifty miles, by motor. The run from
Clifton Gorge to Washington can be
made in seven hours.
Washington, Jan. 3. President Wil
son will return to the capital tomor
row to take charge of the new crisis
caused by the submarine campaign in
the Mediterranean with loss of Amer
ican life.
After conferences over the tele
phone between President Wilson and
Secretary Tumulty and Secretary Lan
sing, it was announced at the White
House and Hot Springs, Va., that the
president would start back to Wash
ington tonight, arriving tomorrow
morning.
Secretary Lansing announced he
had instructed Ambassador Penfield
at Vienna to ask the Austrian govern
ment for . any information which
might determine the nationality of
the submarine which is said to have
sunk the Persia and which would de
velop the facts in the case.
Situation Very Grave.
It was stated authoritatively that
the destruction of the British Huer
Persia with loss of American life and
the destruction of the British ship
Glengyle had put such a grave as
pect on the relations of the "United
States with ,the Teutonic .powers that
the president considered It necessary
to return to the White House at once
for conferences with Secretary Lans
ing and the other members of the cab
inet to shape the course of the gov
ernment. The situation as it exists today was
described in official quarters as par
alleling the crisis which was caused
by the sinking of the Arabic close on
Germany's assurances In response to
the representations of the United
States on the destruction of the Lusi
tania. While officials are keeping their
minds open until they have learned all
the facts in the Persia case officially,
and know whether Americans were
endangered in the sinking of the Glen
gyle, the gravity of the situation is
not minimized and the declaration of
Baron Zwiedinek, the Austrian charge
that be was confident the final ex
planation would be satisfactory, has
not lessened the tension.
Ship Carried a Gun.
One now fact devolopod in the Per
sia case. Tho American consul at
Alexandria reported tho ship carried
one .1.7-inch gun but did not state
where the gun was mounted. This
may become a factor In tho case. The
Hague convention, however, provides '.
j
that a merchant ship may carry a gun
mounted on the stern for purposes of
defense without being called an armed
ship.
The .official view is that the ques
tion of whether a gun was mounted on
the Persia will depend entirely on
where it was placed. If mounted for
ward, officials realized the Austrian
government could contend the Persia
was armed for destruction of subma
rines and had instructions to ram or
destroy the submerslbles. The dispo
sition is not 'to assign the incident of
the gun to a place in consideration of
the case until all the facts are known.
American Officials Amazed.
Officials consider that the Austrian
submarine campaign in the Mediter
ranean has brought on just such a
crisis as did the German submarine
campaign in the declared war zone
around the British Isles. Coming
close on the conciliatory assurances
iu Austria's Ancona note the continu
ed submarine activity, principally
around the entrance to the Suez canal,
has alarmed and amazed American of
ficials who have grave apprehensions
over the developments of the next
few days.
Austrian Charge Pleads With Wilson.
During the morning Baron Zwied
inek, charge of the Austrian embassy
called on Secretary Lansing and asked
that judgment be withheld until all
the facts were known and expressed
his belief that a final explanation
would be satisfactory. He also sought
any available information for the ben
efit of his government.
Baron Zwiedinek also assured Sec
retary Lansing that if it were proved
that an Austrian submarine had sunk
the Persia his government would give
full reparation and satisfaction.
'Countries to Be Formally Notified.
Secretary Lansing said that some
action would be taken to formally
notify Turkey and Bulgaria of the at
titude of the United States toward
submarine warfare so that all the
central power belligerents operating
In the Mediterranean might not be
uninformed.
Mr. Lansing was asked today what
the attitude of the state department
would be if investigation developed
that Austrian submarines in the Med
iterranean were commanded by Ger
man naval officers. The secretary
said the department was inclined to
let the nationality of the vessel itself
determine the responsibility.
It is possible that Ambassador Ger
ard at Berlin may be requested to
seek information on the sinking of
the Persia.

JUDGE WW. REEDER
REUS FROM
OFFICE
Municipal Judge William H. Reed
er, Jr., retired from office at noon
today, following one of the briefest
"after New Year's" sessions in the an

cases were disposed of. The first was
that of the city vs. Sam Salkelu and
the defendant forfeited $25 bail. He
was arrested Saturday at the Union

peace.
After the complaint in the case of

1916. Smith pleaded guilty to a charge
of vagrancy. He was arrested at
Twenty-eighth street and Volker ave
nue, Saturday, by Detective Tom Burk,

costing children in that locality, in
an improper mauner. He frankly
stated to the court that he had spoken
to several children, but only in a play
ful manner, and there being no testl
mony offered bearing more seriously
on the case, the defendant was let off
with a five-day jail sentence.
Bert Steel also pleaded guilty to a
charge of vagrancy and was given a
five-day jail sentence. He was ar
rested Saturday night by Special Of
ficer William Richardson.
Mrs. Nlckson, arrested for drunk
enness, under unusually bad circum
stances, last Thursday night at the
Bamberger depot, by Special Officer

four years' incumbency ot Judge Reed
er. During his two terms in office,
