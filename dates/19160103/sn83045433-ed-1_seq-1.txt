Laufhinfffy Leap? Into
The Presidenti Arms
Hot Spring?, Va., Jan. 2.?A
two hours' motor ride and a
short walk broke the monotony
of a quiet Sunday, the last of
their honeymoon here, for Pres
ident and Mrs. Wilson.
An incident of the walk was
hugely enjoyed by more than a
score of guests on the hotel
veranda. As the President and
his bride neared the hotel on
their return, Mrs. Wilson hesi
tated in climbing down a small
embankment. The President
quickly clambered down and
held out his arms. Laughing,
Mrs. Wilton leaped down into
them.
Audible giggles floated out
from the crowded veranda.

Impartial Treatment.
"A peace' call invitine both faction?
of the Republicans to attend the Repub

yesterday by the national committee.
In adroitly phrased language, the Pro
gressives have been asked to attend the
Chicago convention, which meets June 7.
on precisely the same basis as itandpat
Republicans.
Political leaders of both side* declared
yesterday that the call waa a Joint one.
They looked upon it ss an announcement
that the two parties had again merged
into one, and that UMlr fight? would be
.eettled within the party.
The paragraph in the call which, some
believe, will end the open feud and will
go down a* on? of tbe most noteworthy
pronouncements in Republican political
history, follows: ?
The Republican electors of the .lev
erai States and the District of Columbia,
Alaska, Hawaii, Porto Rico, and the
Philippine Islands and all other electors
without regard to vast affiliations who
believe tn the principles of the Republi
can party and indorse Its policies are
cordially invited to unite under this call
in the selection of delegates to the ?aid
convention.'
It was said by a weil-informed Repub
lican leader that the Progressives have
been ?assured by the standpatters that
a temporary chairman, agreeable to
them, would b-e selected. It la even
predicted that Senator Borah would be
chosen for this office.
