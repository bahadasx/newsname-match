LANDED BY SALISBURY
Sheriff Salisbury completed a six
months' man hunt tho latter part ot
last week when ho arrested in Jack
sonville, Fin., Robert Parmaloe, who
was wanted on tho chargo of Jumping
a supremo court bail bond in tho sum
of two thousand dollars. Tho shorlft
arrived with Parmaleo yestorday morn
ing and tho 1 At tor Is now hold In Jail
pending convoynnlo to tho penitentiary
at Lincoln.
At tho fall, 1915, torm ot tho district
court, Pftrmaleo, thon living on tho
Albort Beach place northwest of town,
was round guilty of criminal relations
with Minnie Teddio, a girl under eigh
teen years of ago. Ho was given an
indetcrminnto acntenco of from throe
to fifteen years In tho penitentiary.
Pnrmalco took an appeal to the su
premo court and gave a bond for two
thousand dollars, seven men, mostly
roaldcnts of the nbrth sldo signing as
sureties. Last Octobor tho supremo
court affirmed tho verdict of tho lower
court, holding thnt the testimony waa
sufficient to Justify tho vordict. Tlu.
opinion, however, was not mado pub
lic for several weeks thereafter, and
when ahorlff Salisbury sought Pnrma
leo ho found that tho latter had loft
the country and that tho bondsmen
wero In danger "of having to cash up
12,000. With his usual celerity Sallr,
bury began his man hunt. Ho learned
that Parmaleo had boon at his old
homo in Kansas,. but Just a day or two
before had left for parts unknown; it
was next learned that ho had gone
south nnd enlisted In tho navy,, from
which ho later deserted; thon tho luo
run out. Parmaleo, howovor, had n
slater who had lived In North Platte
but a short timo ago had removed to
Omaha. Perhaps, through her, thought
tho shoriff, some cluo ,can bo gained.
An Omaha detective whllo in North
Platte a couple of weeks ago wnu glv
eji a history of the caso and his help
invoked. Tho dotectlvo located the
woman In Omaha and found hor read
ing a letter from tho foster pair.onts of
Pnraninlco and herself, in which was
stated that Parmaleo had been hoard
from and that she should send him at
Jacksonville, Fla., somo things ho had
left at North Platto. This word was
phoned to Shoriff Salisbury Monday of
last week and ho loft the samo night
for Jacksonville, being Joined at Oma
ha by tho detective. Reaching Jack
sonville they hung around tho post
offco for two days and finally Parma-1
leo appeared nt a general delivery
window aad asked for hid mall. Sher
iff Salisbury stepped up to him from
tfto roar. tnpp.cd him on tho shouldor
and said "How do you do, Pni1malce.?'
"Well," Bald Parmaloe, "I guess there
is no use In trying to oscapo, if you
can find a man this far from home."
Parmaleo confessed to tho shoriff
that since leaving North Platte he had
a hard row to hoe, and at one timo for
three dnys a loaf of bread was all ho
had to eat. At another timo ho caught
a chicken, cleaned it, nnd placing a
stick in it ronstod it over a fire.
The bondsmon had offered a reward
of $350 for Pnrmaleo's arrest.
