Upon Nation to Hold
Exercises.
ANNIVERSARY OF
ADOPTION DATE
Every Commynity of Nation Urged to'
Fittingly Observe Day by Patriotic
Exercises and "Dedicate Ourselves
to the Nation, One and Inseparable"
—Recent Circumstances Enhance
Love of Flag—Make Nation Greater.
Washington, May 30. President
Wilson today Issued a proclamation
calling upon the people of the United
States to celebrate flag day, June 14,
with patriotic exercises giving ex
pression to "our thoughtful love for
America." The proclamation follows:
'^Vly fellow countrymen: Many cir
cumstances recently have conspired
to turn our thoughts to a critical ex
amination of the condition of our na
tional life, tO\ the influences which
have seemed to threaten to divide us
in our interests and sympathy, of
forces within and without that seemed
likely to draw us away from traditions
of united purpoBk and action of which
we have been so proud.
"It has therefore seemed to me
fitting that I should call your at
tention to the approach of the anni
versary of the day on which the flag of
the United States was adopted by the
congress as the emblem of the nation,
and that it should this year and the
years to come be siven a special sig
nificance, a day upon which we should
direct our minds with a special desire
of renewal of thoughts of Ideals and
principles of which we have sought to
make our. great government the" em
bodiment.
Calls For Patriotic Exercises.
"1 therefore suggest and request that
thruout the nation and, If possible, in
every community, the 14th day of
June be observed as flag day, with
special patriotic exercises, at which
mearyi shall be taken to give signifi
cant .expression pur_ thought.'love
great mlsftiori: of liberty and Justice, to
Which We have devoted' ourselves as
a people, our determination to make
our nation greater and purer with
each generation and our resolution to
demonstrate'to all the worlil its vital
union in sentiment and purpose, ac
cepting only those as true com
patriots who feel as we do the com
pulsion of this supreme allegiance.
"Let us on that day rededicate ou#
selves to the pation, 'one and in
separable,' fronj, which eyery thought
that is not worthy, of our fathers' first
vows of independence, liberty and
right, shall be excluded, and in which
we shall stand with united hearts for
an America which no man can cor
rupt, no influence draw away from Its
Ideals, no force divide against Itself, a
nation signally distinguished among
all the riatlons of mankind for its clear,
individual conception alike of Its
duties and its privileges, its obligations
and its rights."
