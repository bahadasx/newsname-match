The proclamation follows:
"My fellow countrymen:
"Many circumstances have recent

so proud.

"It has, therefore, seemed to me
fitting that I should call your atten

of tho United States was adopted by
the congress as the emblem of the
Union and to suggest to you that It
should, this year and in the years to
come, be given special significance
as a day of renewal and reminder, a
day upon we should direct our minds
with a special desire of renewal to
thoughts of the Ideals and principles
of which we have sought to make our
great government the embodiment.
"I therefore, suggest and request

COMMON HATRED
OF YENIZELOS
Four Former Premiers Sit in
Greek Cabinet Held To
gether by Spite Against
Popular Leader.
POLITICAL SITUATION
Double and Triple Censorship
Placed on All Press Cable
grams Jealousy and Mu
tual Distrust Reigns.
Athens, Greece, May 30. (Corre
spondence of The Associated Press)
It has been one of the revealing cir
cumstances of the political situation
in Greece since the 'formation of the
Skouloudis Ministry that the 'censor
ship of press cablegrams to other
couutrles has been not only rigid, but
double and sometimes triple. There
has been no censorship at all of the
Greek newspapers.
To jealousy and mutual mistruht
among members of the Cabinet is at
tributed the manifold censorship of
.cablegrams. Four former Premiers
sit In the present Ministry, held to
gether solely by their common hatred
of Venizelos and their desire to keep
him out of office.
Premier Skouloudis, as Minister of
Foreign Affairs, execlses the osten
sible censorship. Telegrams are
brought or sent to the ministry and
submitted to a young diplomatist, for
merly Greek Charge d'Affalres in
Montenegro, who either passes them,
or himself in turn submits them to
the Premier Tho latter process Is a
long one, as Mr. Skouloudis Is in no
hurry, and often the sender of a mes
sage must wait two to three hours lo
learn whether his message may be
sent. He generally must wait In per
son, as the Minister frequently re
quires the alteration of a word or
two. If the sender of the message
is not present to accept the alteration,
the message is killed as a whole.
But though bearing the Premier's
red-pencilled authorization, the mes
sage is by no means sure to go. For
mer Premier and present Minister of
Communications, Rhallys also has a
say about it. He does not always agree
with his colleagues, and if he does
not, the signature of tho regular cen
sor becomes meaningless. No one
sees Mr. Rhallys' censor. The mes
sages are sent to him, he works his
will with them, and they are returned.
There is no appeal and no possibil
ity of explanation or alteration.
But former Premier Demetrois Gou
naris has no great faith in the judg
ment of either of his colleagues. He
is iMinisier oi interior, ana as sucu,
is head of all the police, and of the
secret police in particular and any
messages reflecting on him fail to
arrive at their destination. And re
quests for investigation prove fruit
less waste of effort.
Royal Messages Censored.
In the matter of royal messages, in
terviews with His Majesty, the King
of the Hollenes, or dispatches in which
tho opinions of Constantino I. are cit
ed or referred to, there is still anoth
er censorship that of Count Mercati,
Grand Master of Ceremonies of the
court of Greece. Telegrams of this
nature are referred to the King him
self, and on his approval of them.
Count Mercati Initials each page and
writes a note at the bottom directing
the telegruph authorities to pass tho

message "by order of the King."
But the messages do not pass a bit
more for having received this sanction
of the palace. Minister of Communi
cations Rrallj's inspects them whether
or not they have the King's approval.
Recently a very important paragraph
in an interview given by King Con
stantino to the correspondent of The
Associated Press was "lost" in this
way. When the matter was brought
to the attention of the sovereign -he
concluded that Minister Rhallys was
probably quite wise In deleting the
paragraph in question, and there the
discussion ended.
Tho correspondent of the Berliner
Tageblatt a short time ago created a
sensation by avoiding all censorship
of an "interview which he had had
with King Constantino. Although the
monarch had made it a condition of
his receiving tho German journalist
that there be no interview, the Berlin
correspondent was altogether too de
lighted with what ho heard on the oc
casion of his first meeting with the
Greek sovereign to resist temptation.
But he was too wiley to try to send
his message out by telegraph and risk
its mutilation at the hands of Min
isters Skouloudis, Rhallys and Gou
naris: so he sent it out by post, un
der cover of the German Legation
pouch, and when it was finally pub
lished there was consternation in
Greece. Since that incident Constan
tine of Greece has steadfastly refused
to be directly quoted by anyone for
publication, and has received only ono
journalist, a man in whom he has
great confidence.

City gave Colonel Theodore Roosevelt ' H
a real western reception today. From jH
the moment he reached the Union sta- 1H
tion until he arose in convention hall JH
to fulfill his part as tho city's memo- M
rial orator, tho colonel's time was H
taken up by ceremonies arranged in i jH
his honor. Before noon he had de- j IH
livered two short addresses, one to ; JH
a group of children who greeted him H
in the lobby of his hotel and tho oth- H
er from the hotel balcony to hundreds H
grouped in the streets. In both talks H
tho colonel urged preparedness. , H
Great Crowd Greats Ex-President. f H
A great crowd greeted the former H
president in Union station plaza. Po- j H
through and once the chairman of the H
reception committee, Major William H
Warner, was separated from the guest H
of honor. Colonel Roosevelt pushed j H
ahead to tho motor car without his j M
escort.
In the parade to Colonel Roosevelt's' J
hotel, members of the American Leg- M
ion and tho veterans of foreign wars, j 1
marched ahead of the former presi- 1
dent's car. Behind came the naval ' - 1
militia and seventy-five ex-navy and H
army men. H
When his car passed the yellow dec- M
orated motor cars parked along the M
way bearing banners marked: H
"Votes for women," Colonel Roose- M
volt waved his hat and shouted "hur- WM
rah, hurrah 1" H
Greeted by Little Girls. M
As Colonel Roosevelt mounted the M
steps to the hotel lobby ho was B
greeted by one hundred little girls, M
langing from four to ten years, dress- M
ed In costumes resembling draped M
flags. The children began to sing jl
"America, I love you." Mr. Roosevelt j M
stopped, much impressed by the re- M
ception. H
"I would have been glad to have H
come all the way to Kansas City just M
for this reception" the colonel said fl
to the children. Placing his hands M
upon the shoulders of Major Warner M
and Colonel John B. Stone, a confed- M
erate tvetcran, Colonel Roosevelt M
said: fl
"I stand today by the side of a man M
who wore tho blue in the civil war fl
and a man who wore the gray. But jH
now "wo are Americans and nothing H
else." . fl
Appeals for Patriotism. H
"So on tliis day of all others I ' ' fl
want to appeal to the great west for j M
patriotism. I want to appeal to men H
I know will stand right if tho appeal J B
to help our country is mado to them
in the right wny. I am not in the
least afraid of the patriotism of j
American people. H
Fears Lack of Preparedness. IJ
"What. I am afraid of is that there
may be a lack of preparedness in '
advance. If we are not prepared
thousands of our men will go down
to death and destitution when the ,
crisis comes. I ask for preparedness
not to bring on war, but to protoct ;
our country properly if it docs come." :
