War Party-Hostile Demonstra

(By the SUN News esrte.)
Paris. May 2.-Riots have broken out
in Athens as a result of the Bulgarian
Invasion of Eastern Macedonia, according
to a telegram received from the Greek
capital. Hostile demonstrations were
made in front of the palace.
Bulgarian troops equipped with Ger
man artillery and led by German officers
are violently bombarding the allies' posi
tions on the Demir-Hissar front In Mace
donia, the Athens dispatch stated.
Bulgarians have penetrated Greek ter
ritory for fifteen miles, and at some
pants where Greek troops tried to stem
the invasion they were vigorously shelled
b. the Bulgars.
Brisk Fighting Reported.
London, May 29.-Brisk fighting be
tween Greeks and Bulgars occurred at
several points along the frontier, fol
lowing the invasion of Greek territory
by the Bulgars.
A detachment from the Greek garri
son at Fort Rupel fired op the Bul
gars before evacuating the position.
The Greeks were incensed, according
to Saloniki dispatches today, because
the Bulgars entered the fort before
the time they had stipulated for its
evacuation expired. The Bulgars re
turned the fire, the Greeks withdraw
ing without serious casualties on either
side.
News of the Bulgarian invasion
reached Greek patrefo Stxg the bor
der and has resulted in several ex
changes. The Greek Government has
warned border commanders to take
every precaution to prevent serious
encounters.
Six Miles Into Greek Soil.
Only 3.000 Bulgarians took part in the
advance into Greek territory, according
to the best available information here.
It is the general belief here that the
Bulgarians occupied Forts Rupel, Drago
tina and Spatovo solely as a defensive
measure to guard against allied attack.
The positions lie six miles inside the
frontier and form part of a chain of
defences erected by the Greeks against
possible Bulgarian invasion. The of
licial statement from the Bulgarian war
office, confirming the invasion is silent
as to its purpose.
The Bulgars asserted that they had
the permission of the Greek government
for their act.
The Greek war party, led by former
Premier Venizelos is using the Bulgarian
Invasion to the best advantage in re
newing, the demand that Greece enter the
war on the side of the allies. The Venize
list organs declare that the Bulgars, con
centrating near Xanthi, are planning an
advance against the Greek port of Kaval
la, long coveted by the Bulgars. It is
believed here, however, that King Con
stantine, unwilling to plunge his coun
try into war, will confine action to a
diplomatic protest against the invasion.
