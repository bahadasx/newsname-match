Col. Mosby dared death over fifty
years ago when at the head of a band
of a few hundred confederate raiders
he rode up and down the Shenandoah
valley, capturing outposts, destroying
supply trains and cutting off means of
communication. It has been estimated
that he often neutralized the force of
over 15,000 federals In the valley.

Mosby's most brilliant exploit was
the capture of Gen. Stoughton. On a
March night in 1SC3 he, with 30 fol
lowers, rode through the federal army
to Fairfax court house, only 15 miles
from Washington, whcr.e Gen. Stough
ton was asleep. Although surrounded
by an army said to have been 17,000
strong, the rangers calmly kidnaped
the general, his staff an-d many sen-
tries, and turned them over to the

General Grant once later saved Mos

battlefield became staunch friends.
Mosby stumped the state of Virginia
for Grant during his presidential cam
paign, and was rewarded wilh an ap
pointment as consul at Hong Kong, a
post which ho held for seven years.
When he returned to the United
States, Mosby called on the surviving
members of his rangers and, to his
astonishment, he found that a large
percentage of them had become min
isters. In parting their old colonel
said: "Well, boys, if you fight the Dev

will be something to record on judg

closing years of his life were fpent
in lecturing and authorship. His home
lay across the Potomac, at Warren

Washington, his white hair, and
strong Roman features making him a
picturesque figure on the streets or

"Mosby's War Reminiscences," "The
Dawn of the Real South,", and

month by month since last fall until
now it is greater than at any time
since the effects of the war began to
be felt. Mr. McAdoo accounts for the
situation as follows:
The great boom in business is large

revenue. The prosperity of the coun

the soldiers' plot in Rose Hill. The
address was made by Rev. Cooper
of the Ilroadway Baptist church.
"The lines of the old boys of op
posing forces during the strenuous
days of the sixties are becoming
thinner every year, and it is gratify
ing to note that they have so far
forgotten the bitterness engendered
during this period that the survivors
of the blue feel honored to decorate
the graves of their dead antagonists."

BUSINESS MEN MET YESTERDAY
AFTERNOON TO DISCUSS PLANS
FOR ERECTING BUILDINGS AT
COUNTY FAIR.
A meeting of business men was
called by the secretary of the Cham
ber of Commerce yesterday afternoon
for the purpose of discussing the
method of raising funds to erect the
necessary buildings for the county
fair. Judge Harreld and the old tab
ernacle committee were appointed to
make arrangements for raising funds
to purchase the lumber in the taber
nacle and turn the same over to the
county fair association.
The fair association has several
plans under discussion to raise the
necessary funds for erecting the
buildings for the fair and their ef
forts along the lines they are now
pursuing will make the burden lighter
upon '.he business men of the city.
The last carnival held here netted
a little over three hundred dollars,
and the association hopes to make
as much from the one now here.
Under the law the city in the county
where the fair is held must erect suit
able buildings and donate them to
the fair association. Thi3 will have
to be done by popular subscription
unless the money can be raised oth
erwise. Sam Baird and a few other horse
fanciers have at their own expense
maintained the track at the old fair
grounds in good condition and all that
remains at present to make the
grounds complete is the grandstand
and other buildings which must be
erected before September.
