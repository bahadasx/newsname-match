ColJ.Moshy,
NotedRaider
Passes Away
Washington, May 30. Colonel John
5. Mosby, the most famous confed
erate raider of the Civil war, died here
today after a long illness. He was a
native of Virginia and was S2 years
old.
Colonel Mosby's death, his physic
ians said, was due solely to infirmities
of age and he was conscious and inter
ested in what was going on about him
until an hour before ho passed away.
Cntil six months ago, when he went
into a sudden decline, he was a famil
iar sight about the streets of the cap
ital, apparently vigorous despite his
age. He will be buried at his ances
tral home at Warrenton, Va., probably
Thursday and some survivors of his
noted command will be his pallbearers.
His death on Memorial day was affect
ing to many.
It was saiil that he never took part
in veterns' reunions because 22 years
ago when he attended one of his com
mand at Alexandria, Va., he was so
overcome with emotion he was un
able to speak. Sisters, a son, and
daughters survive him.
Colonel Moshy dared death over
fifty years ago when at the head of
a band of a few hundred confederate
raiders he rode up and down the
Shenandoah Valley, capturing out
posts, destroying supply trains, and
cutting off means of commuication.
It lias been estimated that he often
neutralized the force of over 15,000
federals in the valley.
Horn in Powhattan county, Va., Dec.
6, 1913, and graduated from the Uni
versity of Virgiania in 1Sj2. he was
practicing law in Bristol, Va., when
the war broke out and he began his
career in the Confederate army. He
proved his daring with such effect that
he became a scout for Gen. J. E. 1!.
Stuart and led the celebrated raid
around McOlellan's army on the Chic
ahominy. In Richmond a year later
he recruited au independent cavalry
troop which became famous as Mos
by's Partisan Rangers. They became
night riders and the terror of the Fed
eral troops.
Mosby's most brilliant exploit was
the capture of Gen. Stoughton. On
a March night in 1 S :J he, with 30
followers, rode through the Federal
army in Fairfax court house, only 15
miles from Washington, where Gen.
Stoughton was asleep. Although sur
rounded by an army said to have
been 17.000 strong, the rangers calm
ly kidnapped the general, his staff and
many semris, and turned them over
to the Confederate authorities at Cul
peper witnoul having lost a man.
Gen. Grant once later saved Moshy
from hanging, and two foes of the bat
tle field became staunch friends. Mos
hy stumped the sate of Virginia for
Grant during his presidential cam
paign, and was rewarded with an ap
pointment as consul at Hong Kong,
post, which he held for seven years.
When he returned to the Cnited
Stales, Moshy called on the surviving
members of his rangers and, to his
astonishment, ho found that a largo
percentage of them had become min
isters. In parting their old colonel
said: "Well, boys, if you fight the
devil like you fought the Yankees
there will be something to record on
Judgment day."
He next became special land agent
for the government in Colorado, and
from 1104 to 1910 he was attorney in
the department of justice. The clos
ing years of his life were spent in
lecturing and authorship. His home
lay across the Potomac., at Warrenton,
Va., but he was often seen in Wash
ington, his white hair, and strong Ro
man features, making him a pictur
esque ligure on the streets or lecture
platform. He had written "Mosby's
War Reminiscences." "The Dawn of
the Real South," and "Stuart's Cav
alry Campaign." He was also known
as a Greek scholar.
"My military creed," he once de
claiwd, "is this: It is better to make
a good run than a bad stand."

OBSERVE FLAG DAY
URGES PRESIDENT
Wilson issues Proclamation Calling
I'pon the People of Country to
Celebrate Event
Washington, May 30. President Wil
son today issued proclamation call
ing upon the :ljepplo of the United
States to observe' flag day, June 14.
The proclamation 4tlovfctt-:-
My Felloy Countrymen: ' Many'-.cir-cumstances
have recently cofvgplred
to turn our thoughts to a critical ex
amination of the conditions of our na
tional life, of the influences .which
have seemed to threaten to divide us
in interest and sympathy, of forces
within and forces without that seem
ed likely to draw us away from the
happy traditions of united purpose and
action of which we have been so
proud.
It has, therefore, seemed to me fit
ting that I should call your attention
to the approach of the anniversary of
the day upon which the flag of the
United States was adopted by the con
gress as the emblem of the union and
to suggest to you that it should, this
year and in the years to come, be
given special significance as a day of
renewal and reminder, a day upon
which wo should direct our minds
with a special desire of renewal to
thoughts of the ideals and principles
of which we have sought 1o make our
great government the embodiment.
I, therefore, suggest and request
that, throughout the nation, and if
possible in every community, the 14th
day of June be observed as flag day
with patriotic exercises at which
means shall be taken to give signifi
cant expression to our thoughtful love
of America, our comprehension of the
great mission of liberty and justice
to which we have devoted ourselves
as a people, our pride in the history
and our enthusiasm for the political
program of the nation, our determina
tion to make it greater and purer with
each generation, and our resolution to
demonstrate to all the world its vital
union in sentiment and purpose, ac
cepting only those as true compatriots
who feel as we do the compulsion of
this supreme allegiance. Let us on
that day rdedioate- ourselves to the
nation, "one and inseparable," from
which every thought that is not wor
thy of our fathers' first vows of inde
pendence, liberty and right shall be
excluded and in which we shall stand
with united hearts for an America
which no man can corrupt, no influ
ence draw away from its ideals, no
force divided against itself, a nation
signally distinguished among all the
nations of mankind for its cWr, indi
vidual conception alike of its duties
and its privileges, its obligations and
its rights.

lIEW COINS TO BE
MINTED IN JULY
Specially Designed Half 'Dollars Qnar
ters and Dimes Planned by Sec
retary McAdoo.
Washington, May 30. Dimes, quar
ters and half dollars ot new design,
will be minted after July 1, Secretary
McAdoo announced today. For the
first time since 1S91, a change will be
effected in these pieces. The announce
ment disclosed that the half dollar
has fallen practically into disuse. The
new design was selected with hope
of restoring it into more general circu
lation, it was indicated. Under the
new coinage, each piece will be ot dif
ferent design.
The face of the new half dollar
bears a full length of liberty, with a
background of the American flag fly
ing to the breeze. The goddess is
carrying laurel and oak branches,
symbolic of civil and military glory.
The reverse side shows an eagle perch,
ed high upon a mountain crag, wings
unfolded. Growing from a rift in the
rock is a sapling of mountain pine,
symbolic of America.
Te design of the twenty-five cent
piece is intended to typify the awaken
ing of the country to its own position,
says McAdoo.
Liberty, a full length figure, is
shown stepping toward the country's
gateway, bearing upraised a shield
from which the covering is being
drawn. The right hand bears an olive
branch of peace. Above the head is
the word "Liberty" and below the feet
"191i," the reverse side bears a figure
of an eagle in full flight, wings ex
tended and the inscriptions "United
States of America" and "K. Pluribua
L'num."
Both the half dollar and the quarter
bear the phrase "In God We Trust."
The desiga of the dime is simple.
