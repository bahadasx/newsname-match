effectiveness after another year of
th) reorganizing and practical work
to which It has been subjected In
the last few years, there were the
(panlsh War Veterans and Hoy
Scouts and the Junior American
Guards In great masses. Tho earnest,
nets of the youngsters In khaki knee
breeches and their nlert eagerness
to ahow their respect for the old
veterans and the spirit of tint day,
brought continuous shouts of ap
plause from tho spectators who were
massed along tho Drive. Their re
Mptlon was second only to that
which was given to the white-haired
aoidtera of more than half a cen
tury ago.

"I Hope They Send Men Who'
Killed Him to the Electric i
Chair," Cries Boy of Eight.
Whllo thousands of men marched
to-day to the rhythm of music and
drum and n great city paid silent
trlbuto to tho country;? gallant doad,
a widow and two little kiddles In a
flat on tho top floor of No. 722 Coi
i umbus Aenue awaited the body of
I their dead hero. Policeman Henry II.
i Schwartz, who was murdered In the
j performance of his duty. Ho was shot
In a battle with gunmen In a collar at
No. 156 First Avenue early yesterday
I morning and died In IJellevue to-day.
; Kergt. Alexander Knlttle, said to be
one of the finest specimens of the
police force on tho cast side, gave
up sixteen ounces of his blood In an
effort to sare the llfo of his comrade,
and Patrolman Dennis Buckley stood
1 in reservo ready to yield more of tho
precious fluid for transfusion Into
Schwartz's nrterles.
At 11 o'clock last night Policeman
Schwartz parted with his wife, smiling
and cheerful, telling her he would see
j her to-day. An hour later ho leaned
on his arm, half sitting up In bed, nml
Identified Antonio lllccabone as tho
ninn who kicked him while he lay on
the cellar floor. At 2 o'clock Schwartz
died In a delirium, under the hallucina
tion that he was on his post. Hn sa
luted an Imaginary captain Just before
lie died.
Just a fow moments before ho died,
It was announced to-day by tho po
lice, Schwartz also Identified the pic
tures of Giovanni IMccahone, sixty
years old, father of Antonio, and
Damlco, a brother, oa those of fho
men who had shot him. Ho had sum
moned them to court aeveral times for
minor violations. A description and
order for tho arrest of tho men li.is
been sent throughout tho country.
Schwartz would have boen on the

plumber before becoming a policeman.
Ho was ambitious for advancement,
and his record is an excellent one, Ho
lived for his little family and was with
them always when off duty and during
his vacations. Harry, his boy, is eight
years old, and Agnes Is a tot of Jive.
It was tho pollceman'H greatest Joy
I to romp with tho kiddles and to
spend tho day with them In tho open,
In tho woods or on tho beach. Ho
was thirty years old, six feet tall and
built In proportion. Ho never talked
shop in his homo never mentioned
tho scraps from which ho had como,
Just off duty. Only to his wife ho
would remark with a smllo: "Never
mind; somo day I'll be u captain."
.Mrs. Scln . went to ncllevuo
Hospital yesterday and took Harry
with her. Tho boy was proud his
father was a big rollcomnn, They
told him his father was sick, but In
stinct told hltn something else. Per
haps hu heard thorn talking at tho
hospital, for suddenly ho cried: "is
my papa shot in tho heart7"
They didn't take him In to sen his
father. It was thought there was
little danger of death whim tho boy
was taken away. Going home, ho
said: "1 wish they got those men that
hot my papa and put them in the
electric chair."

ASSAILANT NOT KNOWN.

pening Until Told Weapon
Found in Street.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Mny .10. An
open pocket knife was thrown nt Col.
Theodore lloosevelt here to-day ns his
motor car turned Into Twenty-third
Street during a Memorial Day parade.
The knife struck the automobile and
was picked up by a member of the
American l.eglnn. which followed
close behind,
John .Mcnrath, ltoosevelt's secte.
iury, said the handle of the knlfo
struck hW arm. which tas hanging
over the sldo of the car.
Hooscvrlt knew nothing of tho In
cident until .V.cOralli told him some
lime later, and tho police had no re
port on the matter. No arrests were
expected.
An address by Col. Theodore lloose
velt was the ptlnclpal event of Kansas
City's programme for tho observance
of Memorial I ny. The day's ceremonies
called for a review by the Colonel
of 1.000 Hoy Scouts and a parade
through the downtown district where
hundreds of Hags had been used In
decorating business buildings.
Five thousand seats on Convention
Hall had bum reserved for members
of the Grand Army of the Itcpuhllc
and the Confederate Veterans, thnt
they might hear the former President
speak Inte this afternoon. Prior to
going to the hall, Col. lloosevelt was
tho guest of honor nt a noonday
luncheon given by the Commercial
Club.
He was given a big welcome as he
passed through the city streets, nnd
he was In his best mood as he re
viewed tho parades.
When lloosevelt arrived at his hotel
ho stopped as ho saw two score little
girls mossod In tho open space In
front of tho hotel desk. F.ach was
dressed In Stars and Strlpos and wore
ii cap u la Columbia. The moment
they caught sight of the Colonel, they
burst Into tho "Star-Hpangled Han
ner." Then they sang "America, I
lM e Thee."
"I've simply got to say a few words
to these children," the Colonel de
clared. "You delightful peisons," he ad
dressed them, "I'd gladly hao trav
elled all the way from Oyster Hay to
Kansas City simply to sin this sight
Nothing could be liner or prettier."
Tho former President dwelt affec
tionately on "the lllue and Gray" and
tho fact that tho nation was now
united. He went on to sermonize on
thi necessity for preparedness to
avert war.
"I was in the Spanish-American
war," ho said "It was a small war,
but It was the only war Just nt that
time. If wo hadn't had a navy well
prepared In thoio days there would
han been ten times the amount of
blood shed that actually wan spilled.
"On this day of all others, I want
to maku an appeal to the patriotism
of tho great West, th" Middle West -
which I know will stand right. Per
haps I nm not the ono who will awak
en the West, but some one will some
time.
At this, the Colonel shook hands

wy to his room. Outside, however,
