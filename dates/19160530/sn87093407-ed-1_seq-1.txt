ROOSEVELT GETS
A GREAT OVATION
IN KANSAS CITY
KNIFE HURLED AT ROOSEVELT CAR
KANSAS CITY, May 30.—During the parade, a
pocket knife struck Roosevelt's car. Whether it
was by accident or design was unknown. There
were no arrests and no excitement.

KANSAS CITY, Mo., May 30.—Full of energy and fight,
Col. Theodore Roosevelt brought his keynote message to Kan
sas City today. Thirty thousand spectators lined the streets
from the railway station to the hotel. Roosevelt's march was
a continuous ovation.
The Colonel stood in his automobile for the entire dis
tance, waving his famous "black slouch hat" in response to
the cheers.
He was scheduled to speak at 4 p. m.
In the Hotel Meyhlebach lobby the colonel stopped a< he
saw 40 little school girls massed in front of the clerk's desk,
each dressed in the Stars and Stripes, and each waving a
Columbia cap.
The moment they sighted Roosevelt they burst out sing
ing "The St.ir Spangled Banner," their shrill voices sounding
high above the roar of the crowds outside.
They repeatedly sang the anthem, then changed to
"America, 1 I-ove Thee," while the colonel stood spellbound,
his face working with emotion.
Colonel Insists Upon Talking to Little
Girls Who Greet Him With Patriotic Song
"I simply must say a few words to these children," he
cried.
"You delightful persons," he addressed them, "I would
gladly have traveled all the way simply to see this. Nothing
could be finer or prettier."
Roosevelt dwelt affectionately on "The Blue and the Gray,"
laying stress on the fact that the nation is now united.
He launched strongly, during his talk, into the theme of
preparedness to avert war.
"The Spanish-American war was small," he said, "but if
we had not had a navy well prepared, there would have been
ten times the bloodshed.
"On this day of all others, I want to appeal to the patriot
ism of the great West and Middle West—which I know will
stand right.
"Perhaps I am not the one who will awaken the West,
but some one will some time.
"1 am not afraid in the least that the American people,
when an appeal comes, won't have brave sons ready, but 1 am
anxious that there be no useless bloodshed because we are
not prepared.
"The surest way to a triumphant conclusion before war
is declared and without war at all, is preparedness."
Then he shook the children's hands and fought his way
thru the throng to his room.
Delivers Another Address to Vast
Crowd That Gathers Before His Hotel
In the streets outside 5,000 citizens set up a clamor that
was not to be denied.
"Teddy! Teddy I Teddy!" they cried.
The colonel stepped thru a window and stood on the
porch, where he waved his hat.
There was a moment of silence while Roosevelt gave a
brief appeal on Americanism, bitterly denouncing those who
"put a pigtail on Uncle Sam."
This was greeted with a thunder of applause.
In his speech this afternoon, punctuated by typical Roose
veltian aphorisms, Colonel Roosevelt laid before a Memorial

"Spcech!" went up in a mighty roar.

For the love of Mike, look

But it rained this morning—dur-
