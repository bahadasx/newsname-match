Strong Body of Soldiers Is
Being Gathered Near
American Border
San Antonio, Tex., May 29.—Re
ports concerning the concentra

huahua have been transmitted to
headquarters here by Gen. Bell at
El Paso. It is indicated that the
force massed in the territory num
bers approximately 20,000 men.
Washington, D. C., May 29. —Manuel
Mendez an attache of Gen. Carranza'a
foreign office, arrived here today and
conferred with Eliseo Arredondo, the
Mexican ambassador, but denied that
he brought a note as has been expect
ed or that he brought any instructions
from his chief. He declared he was

a
vaca­
tion.
Mr. Arredondo and other Mexican of
ficials professed to be puzzled. It has
been reported from Mexico City and
the border that a special messenger
was bringing a new communication
from Gen. Carranza. No indication of
its contents has been given but it gen
erally has been assumed by American
officials that the expected note renew
ed the demand for the withdrawal of
American forces or made a protest
against the second punitive expedition
led by Col. Sibley and Maj. Langhorne
whiefrhas-however, returned to Amer
ican territory. At the Mexican embas
sy it was said that if a note was com*
ing it probably would be brought by
some other messenger.
Representations are about to be
made to the state department for the
release of
a
quantity of copper and ma­
chinery consigned to the Carranza gov
ernment but not detained in New York
Mr. Arredondo declared today, that,
lacking other instructions, this was the
only question he had to take up with
the state department at this time.
Special Agent Rodgers at Mexico
City telegraphed that the note should
have reaohed Washington yesterday.
He has been assured that it will not
be made public until delivered to Sec
retary Lansing. Mr. Arredondo, how
ever, reiterated that he had no official
advices that a note was on its way.
MEETING DATE IN DOUBT.
Columbus, N. M., May 29.—No word
has been received from Gen. Gavira
regarding the date for his conference
with Gen. Pershing. As Gen. Pershing
is understood to have selected
a
spot
near Colonia Dublan for the meeting,
the time, it is said, has been left to
the convenience of the Mexican leader.
It is believed that Gen. Gavira is in
communication with Gen. Carranza,
receiving instructions as to the prop
ositions to be laid before Gen. Per
shing which will have to do more or
less with the present dispositions of
American troops in Chihuahua.
It is expected Gen. Gavira will re
mind Gen. Pershing that the further
presence of American troops in Mexi
co is unnecessary and that until the
troops are withdrawn demonstrations
against the American troops by the
civilian population are inevitable.
According to information received
here tonight, several bandit bands are
operating south of the American lines
In territory recently evacuated by
Gen. Pershing's columns.
VILLA CACHE FOUND.
Field Headquarters, near Namiquipa,
Mexico, May 28.—(via wireless to
Columbus, N. M., May M.)—Ten ma
chine guns, 380 rifles and a quantity of
ammunition discovered in a Villa
cache near here were brought to field
headquarters today. Military authori
ties here cling to the belief that the
cache contained a greater quantity of
the armament which Villa was report
ed to have hidden in the Bachiniba
district on his northward march before
the raid upon Columbus, N. M.
American army intelligence officers
are seeking further hiding places of
weapons and ammunition.

PEOPLE EXCITED
GREEK TROOPS' FALL BACK WITH.
OUT RESISTING ADVANCE OF
THE INTRUDERS.
Paris, May 29.—A news dispatch
from Athens says that grave trouble
has broken out there following the
news of the invasion of Macedonia by
the Bulgarians.
Bulgarian troops crpsed the Greek
frontier on May 26, and. occupied the
Greek forts of Rupel, Dragotin and
Spatovo. The Greek troops which had
garrisoned these forts withdrew on
the advance of the Bulgarians, who
claimed permission from Athens for
their act. The Bulgarians were said
to be led by German officers who ex
plained to the commanders of the
Greek forts that the central powers
were merely being accorded the same
privilege that had been given the
allies in permitting them to occupy
Saloniki.
It was reported from Athens yester
day -that feeling was running very
high in the Greek capital over the Bul
garian invasion. The Herald, the
organ of M. Venizelos, appeared yes

the former premier.

be making its way southeastward
toward the Aegean seaport of Kavala,
northeast of Saloniki. The Greeks

along the Struma riveV, without re
sistance. The rejuvenated Serbian
army, estimated at 80,000 to 100,000,
has landed at Saloniki to reinforce the
British and French troops already
there.
On the French front around Verdun

leREAT EMPIRE
BUILDER IS DEAD
James J. Hill Passes Away
After Making Heroic
Battle for Life
UNCONSCIOUS FOR
LAST TWELVE HOURS
History Is Like Romance
of Fiction Developed
Whole Northwest
St Paul, Minn., May 29. —James J.
Hill, railroad builder, capitalist and
most widely known figure of the north
west. died at his Summit avenue resi
dence at 9:30 o'clock this morning as
the result of an infection due to bowel
trouble.
Mr. Hill was unconscious for nearly
twelve hours before he died. Dr. Her
man M. Biggs of New York and Dr.
Stanley Seager of the Mayo staff, to
gether with members of the immediate
Hill family, were at the bedside when
the end came.
Mr. Hill's personal secretary, M. R.
Brown, made the announcement of his
distinguished employer's demise to
waiting newspaper correspondents at
the Hill residence. His statement was
made verbally, with the intimation
that a written bulletin might be issued
later.
Questioned regarding a date for ob
sequies, Mr. Brown said that no ar
rangements had been discussed. The
secretary appeared greatly affected
and declined to talk further than to
make the bare announcement of the
death.
James J. Hill discovered "the bread
basket of the world" in the great
northwest he led In its development
from a ^wilderness into what now com
prises six wealthy states dotted with
400,000 farms and he blazed a trail
for transportation which reached
eventually from Buffalo to Asia, with
a total mileagp
rf
rail and steamship
facilities that nearly girdle the
earth.
That but rougliiy tans the story of
his achievement.
Near Guelap, in Ontario, where
James Jerome Hill was born in 1838,
the sqn of an Irish-Canadian farmer
who died when the boy was 15, there
stands a tree stump labeled: "The
last tree chopped by James J. Hill."
It marked the lad's resolution to go
to the United States. He had been
prompted by an odd incident. Accord
ing to the story that is told, a strange
traveler had stopped at the Hill farm
to take dinner, and left his horse at
the gate. Young Hill saw the animal
was tired and he carried it a pail of
water. The stranger was pleased with
the lad's thoughtfulness, and as he
drove off he tossed him a newspaper
from the United States, and oalled out
gravely:
"Go there, young man. That coun
try needs youngsters of your spirit."
Hill read the paper carefully. It
contained glowing accounts of oppor
tunities in the states. He resolved to
investigate for himself. It was the
next morning that he chopped his last
tree.
As a mere routsabout lad of 18, he
toured from Maine to Minnesota.
When in 1855, he disembarked from a
Mississippi river packet at St. Paul
that place was a frontier town of 5,000
inhabitants. At the sign of W. J. Bass
& Co., agents for the Dubuque & St.
Paul Packet Co., he found a Job as
both stevedore and clerk.
In the fifteen years that followed he
seized every opportunity to study the
whole problem of river transportation.
He gathered no end of experience and
a little capital with which he launched
his own firm of Hill, Griss & Co., which
promptly displayed its initiative by
bringing the first load of coal that had
ever been seen in that section into St.
Paul. Two years later with a flat
bottomed steamer he established the
first regular communication with St.
Paul and the Manitoba ports of the
fertile Red river valley.
At about that time St. Paul was hav
ing its first experiment In railroad
building. Eighty miles had been laid
to St. Cloud, 316 miles to Brecken
ridge, both of which terminals were
at the southern end of the Red river
valley, and there were about 100 milns
of track "which began now'h'ere and
ended in that same indefinite spot."
This venture ran up a debt of $33,
000,000 and collapsed, with its only as
sets being "a few streaks of rust and
a right of way."
Hill had had sufficient success in the
region to be seized with a consuming
desire to purchase the defunct prop
erty. After five years of financial
dickering, Including the sale of all his
other interests which netted a fortune
of $100,000, he and a syndicate of
three others—Sir Donald A. Smith,
George Stephen, and Norman W. Kit
son—obtained the object of this de
sire.
The St. Paul, Minnesota and Mani
toba railway was formed to operate
the property, with Hill as general
manager. When in 1883 Mr. Hill was
elected president he undertook the
extension of the road from its Dakota
and Minnesota homestead to the Pa
cific ocean. He was confronted by

ON A FAKE RACE
WEALTHY ILLINOIS MAN SWIND­
LED WHEN TRYING TO BET
ON A 8URE THING.
DecatuF," 111., May 29.—Decatar and
Springfield police are today searching
for two men who secured $4,600 from
Henry Hurd, a wealthy farmer, by
means of a fake horse race scheme at
St Petersburg, Fla., about a month
ago. Hurd was spending some time
at St. Petersburg, Clear Lake and
Coldwater, Fla., when he met two
strangers who declared they were on
the "inside" on a big horse race.
Hurd was induced to place $4,500
on the race. Later he met the two
men and they told him he had won.
Hurd refused to take the money be
cause he said he did not want to carry
such a large sum around with him. A
meeting of the three men was arrang
ed to be held in Springfield, 111., at
which time Hurd was to receive his
winnings.
Hurd became suspicious before the
time of the meeting, however, and
complained to the police. The strang
ers have not been located.

Boston Men Appear Before Senators

Washington, D. C.. May 28.—Win
throp L. Marvin and Edward E. Blod

of Commerce, appeared before a sen
ate committee today to oppose the gov
ernment ownership and operation feat
ures of the shipping bill.
"We fear," said Mr. Marvin, "that
government participation in the ship
ping business would be an entering
wedge toward socialism, that file ef
fect of such operation would mark an
advance toward government acquisi
tion in other fields."
As an alternative for government
operation, the Boston representatives
suggested carefully supervised and
guarded subsidies from the govern
ment sufficient to offset the difference
in cost between operation of ships un
der the American and foreign flags and
government subventions to establish
regular mail and freight lines to coun
tries where United States interests are

.CRUISER'S GUNNERS
ESTABLISH RECORD
San Diego, Cal., May 29. —What Is
believed to be a new record for accur
ate and rapid flre long range shooting
was established by gun crews of the
cruiser San Diego at elementary prac
tice off this port Saturday night, it was
asserted today. The official number of
hits will not be known until the target
screens are examined by the umpires
but it is reported the six Inch gun
crew scored twenty-nine htts in forty
shots, while the men behind the three
inch batteries achieved fifteen hits In
twenty-seven shots. The firing range

Chicago, May 29. —The steamer
Eastland tomorrow will make its first
trip lakeward since it turned over last
summer in the Chicago river, causing
the death of more than eight hundred
persons. The boat is to be towed to a

for the woods two miles west of town.
During the afternoon while the moth
er aat on the bank fishing the boys
asked If they might wade in the creek
and were told they could, but to re
move their outer clothing. The stream
seemed shallow and the mother felt
safe in giving permission. The fath
er was attracted by the dog having
treed an object and went to see what
occasioned the animal's barking, thus
being away at the time the mother
missed her boys who had wandered
some distance from where they en
tered the stream.
NOT PLEASING TO
BRITISH PIPERS
PRESIDENT IS CRITICIZED FOR
FAILURE TO SYMPATHIZE
WITH THE ALLIES.
London, May 29.—"Irresponsible
peaoe talk received its quietus from
Sir Edward Grey last week but no
doubt President Wilson's speech be
fore the League to Enforce Peace win
revive1 the discussion in certain Quar
ters,M says the Liverpool Post. "Its
definiteness in certain particulars is
arresting but perhaps to many of his
own countrymen the air of definiteness
which the president gives to some of
his' phrases may Mem elusive.
"One can imagine many being spec
ially disappointed whe& he says that
with the causes and objects of the war
the United States has no ooncern. To
as, who believe we are opposing an at
tempt at world domination, it is hard
to believe that the cause for which we
stand la not of some ooncern to the
great republic of the west."
The Post argues that the entente
allies are fighting for virtually the
same object for which President Wil
son proposes a league of nations.
The Manchester Guardian says this
plan of the president is almost as old
as the first formulation of the Ideal
of organized peace, but that it never
before In any part of the world has
commanded the support accorded it in
America today. This newspaper says
further:
"The president inevitably has con
fined himself to cautlouB and general
terms but it is impossible to miss the
significance of his declaration that
the United States would be ready to
become a party to any feasible league
of nations. Twenty-one months of
war have done much to undermine
even the rooted Amesican aversion
from alliances and

leagues."
In his speech President Wilson ex
pressed a willingness to institute
peace proceedings whenever any of
the belligerents should indicate a de
sire for such. At the same time he ex
pressed the belief that peace following
the crushing of one side or the other,
would be unsatlafaotory.
POPE DEPLORES CHARGES.
Rome. Sunday, May 28.—Cardinal
Gasparri, papal secretary of state, is
quoted by Rome newspapers to the
effect that Pope Benedict, while main
taining strictest neutrality, deplores
the anti-Christian and Inhumane as
pects of the war. In the absence of
satisfactory evidence of an impartial
nature, the pope is unable to pass
judgment on charges of improper con
duct of war made on both sides. The
pope is represented as cherishing the
belief that the conclusion of hostilities
may be hastened by a greater degree
of Christian tolerance on both sides,
by partial renunciation of claims and
by keener sympathy for suffering peo
ples.
