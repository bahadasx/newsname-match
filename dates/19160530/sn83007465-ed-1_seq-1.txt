Letter Day For Lancaster.
The conference of Group Six.
South Carolina Banker's Association
was called to order promptly at 12:00
o'clock, Mackey Opera House. Fri
day, May 26. 1916. by the chairman,
Mr. W. R. Scarborough of Bishopville.
Invocation by Rev. Hugh R.
Murchlson of Lancaster. The address
of welcome was delivered by Mayor
C. D. Jones.
Response by Mr. C. H. Yates of
Camden. S. C. Mr. Yates, in his
highly pleasing way, complimented
the business men of Lancaster on
the wonderful progress made in th's
city from an industrial and civic
standpoint during the past few years.
The first speaker was Mr. Ira B.
Dunlap, president of the National
Union Bank, Rock Hill, S. C.. on the
subject, "The Country flanker's Influence
In the Community." Mr.
Dunlap is well known to the citizens
of Lancaster county and is regarded
as one of the most progressive bankers
to be found in South Carolina.
Mr. Dunlap's address was as follows:
. "There is Just so much business in
' your community and after you have
gotten your share of that business
it is necessary to create more business,
if you expect to continue to
grow. Of course, we all know thnt
a community is going to grow to a
certain extent, even though there is
no concerted action on the nart of
the citizens, but in order to mak"
what we consider real progress, some
organized* method must be pursued.
How are you going- to do this?
Some think you should fo.rm a Chamber
of Commcrotj 01; Hoard of Trade,
raipe a considerable n^uount of money,
advertise extensively and in this
way induce people to come in and
start new enterprises. This, to my
mind, is the hardest way to create
new business, and#certainly the most
expensive way. The simplest way
Is to utilize the material you have
in hand and make it produce more
business.
I am thoroughly convinced that
our section is unquestionable an
agricultural section, rather than a
manufacturing section?we should,
therefore, push farming. Diversified
farming will make a rich set of farmers.
Not all farmers will make
money in farming along any lines,
but there will be more farmers who
will make money by farming along
diversified lines than they will by

House Begins Consideration Under
Five Minute Kule, to
Close This Week.
Washington. May 29.? Majority
Leader Kltchin made his promised
speech in behalf of the naval appropriation
bill in the house to-day, explaining
that while he believed the
measure provided for greater preparedness
on sea than the country real- 1
lv needed he was supporting It be- J
rause it eliminated the navy department's
flve year building program
He devoted blmself most vigorously
to attacking the socalled big navy J
men.-asserting that the present clamor
for preparedness was due in the
main to hysteria and jingoism.
In opposing the ^ve year program
Mr. Kitchin said it would be foolisb
to contract for ships at present high j
prices wheYi it was probable that the ,
cost of materials would be much ,
lower after the war. t
General debate closed with Mr. i
Kitchin's speech and the house tl^k t
began consideration of the bilh^^^Bj
der the rule permitting five
speeches on amendments. This prolHt
ably will be continued until 4 o'olo^fi|

applause from the galleries in d? <

the establishment of what are known

i lie verdun region and southern
Tyrol continue to be the theatres
where the most sanguinary battles
are taking place. While *he Italians
ar(. holding back the Austrians from
further advances and inflicting heavy
losses on them in counter attacks in
Tyrol their Germans allies have been
abl?> to make another gain in the capture
of about 3on metres of French
trenches northwest of the village of
Cumieres on the left bank of the
Meuse near Verdun.
Fighting of great intensity lias
been in progress around Hill 304 and
between Le Mort Homme and Cumieres.
but except near Cumieres all
the Germans' vicious onslaughts were
set at naught by the vigorous counter
offensives of the French.
The sectors east ar.d west of Fort
Douaumont and northeast of Verdun
have witnessed still another violent
artillery duel, but no infantry attacks
were launched. The artillery
of both sides has been usv along
the remainder of the front'in Franco
and Belgium.
In Tyrol the Austrians in the Lagarina
valley and south of the Hosina
torrent threw heavy assaults against
the Italian positions, but the Italians
repulsed the attackers with considerable
loses. On the Asigo plateau
the men of two ba,^^|g^\vhlch were
surrounded on Monte^^Wciag by the
Austrians were relieved by an Italian
regiment and their runs brought
safely away.

Since the commencement of the
