(United Press staff correspondent.)
Kansas City, Mo., May 30. Full of
cnorbj" and ifightf, Colonel Theodore
Uoosevelt brought his keynote message
to Kansas City today. Thirty thou
sand spectators lined the streets from
tho railway station to the hoel, and
ldoosovelt 's march was a continuous
ovation. The colonel stood in his au
tomobile for tho entire distance, wav
ing his famous black Blouch hat in re
sponse to tho cheering.
During tho parade a pocket knif.
struck Roosevelt's car. Whether it
was by accident or design was un
known. There were no arrests and no
excitement. ,
The knife was a small one and one
lilade was open.
' i Intel Roosevelt was ignorant of
t'.e incident until Secretary MeCirall:
informed him several Hours afterward.
The knife hit McGratn's arm as it
Iini.g out of the colonel's tar. Tho
pe. retary we angry over the sonsatiofi
111 report lint had been sent out at
what he referred to as "triviul inr.
dent." In tho Hotel Meulcmncb. lobby the-
colonel stopped as he saw 40 little
nchool girls massed in front of the
clerk's desk, each dressed in the star9
and stripes, and each wearing tv Colum
bia cap.
The moment they sighted Roosovelt
they burst out singing "The Star
Bpangled Banner," their shrill voices
pounding high above the roar of the
Crowds outside. They repeatedly sang
the anthem, then changed to "Amer
ica, I I.ove Thee," while the colonel
niood spellbound, his face suffused with
emotion.
"I simply must say a few words to
these children," he cried. "You de
lightful persons," he addressed them,
"I would gladly have traveled all the
vvay simply to see this. Nothing could
lie finer or prottier."
Talks on Preparedness.
Roosevelt dwelt affectionately on
t!ie "blue and the gray," laying stress
on the fact that the . nation is now
united.' He launched strongly into his
theme of preparedness to avert war.
"The Spanish-American war was
mnnll," lie said, "but if we had not
bad a navy well prepared there would
bave been 10 times the bloodshed. On
this day of all others I want to appeal
to the patriotism of the great west and
middle we.it which I know will stand
right. Perhaps I am not tho one who
pill awaken the west, but some one
will some time."
"I am not afraid in the least that
the American people when an appeal
monies won't have brave sons ready, but
T- nm anxious that there be no useless
Moodshed because we are not pre
pared," said Roosevelt. "The surest
way to a triumphant conclusion before

FinmyiAiiiiER
Sedgwick Post G. A. R. Opens
Day With Services at
Soldiers' Monument
ACRES OF FLOWERS TELL
OF NATION'S GRATITUDE
Greatest Parade In Salem's
History Feature of After
noon Program
With a program of events that filled
the entire day thousands of Salem's
citizens paid tribute to tho soldier dead
of the Grand Array of tho Republic in
the grentcBt Memorial day servico ever
held in this city. The feature of the
day was the parade which got under
vuy shortly after t o'clock this aft
ernoon and wound through the streets
to Willson pnrk whore the prinoipnl
exercises were hold. From the point
of numbers taking part in today's pa
rado was the greatest ever attempted
in Salem, and brought universal com
mendation to tho genernl committee in
charge of tho affair.
The timo honored "thin blue line"
which grows painfully thinner with
each succeeding Memorial day, con
cluded this year to leave the brunt of
the management of tho Memorial day
exercises to a general committee. Here
tofore the veterans of the great strug
gle for the integrity of the Union have
shouldered the responsibility of honor
ing their dead comrades but this year
the matter was left to the younger or
ganizations by tho members of Sedg
wick Post, No. 10. The result more
thtin. fulfilled tho expectations of the
post. Not only were the dead honor
od, but a rare tribute to the few sur
vivors of the nationul conflict was
shown when tho non-military organiza
tions as well as the military, tho fra
ternal societies, the churches, tho
Bchools and the patriotic public in gen
eral, hastened to lend all possible aid
in making tho 1916 Memorial day in
Halem one that will remain as a prece
dent for the succeeding years.
Services at Cemetery,
The hopes o'f the Grand Army of the
Republic that the day might be perpetu
ated long after they have answered
their last roll call wcro assured of
fulfillment by the interest shown by
(ho children and younger men of tho
'dty, whose only recollections of the
Civil war are the pictures of tho cop
flic.t in their school histories.
Now when nil traces of the struggle
which threatened to divide the nation
have been erased and when time has
obliterated the marks which scarred the
fair name of our republic, it is fitting
that only the memory of tho principle,
which triumphed through -the loyalty
and bravery of tho men who worn hon
ored today, should bo upheld as the
standard of patriotism for future gene
rations.
The regular Memorial services con
ducted by Sedgwick post, No. 10, at the
base of the Soldiers' Monument in the
cemetery this morning, opened with
the reading of Genernl Logan's or
der No. 7 by Comrade Good setting one
day apart upon which the graves of the
dead might Do decorated. Commander
W. C. Faulkner then delivered the Me
morial address which was followed by
the placing of flowers at tho base of
the monument in memory of tho dead
who rest in other spots. Each member
of the G. A. R. deposited his floral
tributo in memory of tho deceased mem
bers of his own compnny as each other
surviving eomrndo is doing today.
Bugle Bounded "Taps."
Rev. F. T. Porter, of tho Sons of
Veterans, read Lincoln's Gettysburg ad
dress and the Boy Scouts laid their
flowers nt the foot of the monument.
The Woman's Relief Corps held their
regular services after which the firiag
squad from Company M, O. N. G., fired
three volleys over tho grave and tho
bugle sounded "Taps." licv. Porter
pronounced tho benediction and tho
crowd dispersed to decorate the graves
in other parts of the cemetery. The
Hoy Scouts and the school children
spread out a truck lwad of flowers
which was contributed by the Boys'
Training school. Prominent among
those who took part in the exercises
was Comrado Mitchell, of tho Salem
Sons of Veterans, who is 8(1 years old
and tho oldest son of a veteran in tho
United States belonging to a regular
organization.
Basket luncheons were held by the
families of the Woman's Relief Corps
nt the Moose hall, the families of tho
I. allies of the G. A. It. participated in a
basket luncheon at Ryan hall, am the
families of tho ladies' auxiliary of the
Spanish-American War Veterans held
their basket luncheon in Marion
Square.

etrecls near the armory in three divi
sions, marched north on Commercial

The Presbyterian ministers sharply
cross-examined the preparedness advo
cates. They openly insinuated that the
movement was backed by the munitions
manufacturers who would benefit from
a preparedness program. Tho Metho
