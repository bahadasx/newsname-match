MADE IN OCALA CAR
?ot the pasl six months J.v C.
Smith, the Magnolia street jeweler
and watchmaker, has been, by de
grees, assembling parts of watches,
clocks, motorcycles, Fords,, etc., all of
which he has put together and made
into a neat little car which may be
said to be a cross between a racer and
a motorcycle. This little car was seen
on our streets today for -the first time,
darting in and out among other ve
hicles in quite a lively manner. It
runs well and reflects much credit on
the owner, and the town as well, bear
ing the made in Ocala stamp.
Mr. Smith's car is a ball-bearing,

IIIDEHLL MOVED
Famous Prisoner Has . Been Taken
from the Ocala Jail to the State
Prison Farm
In charge of Captain Tom Bridges,
J. J. Mendenhall left this morning on
the A. C. L. 5:40 train for the state
prison farm at Raiford, where he will
enter oh his life sentence for the
murder of Eusie Eliot, near Clear
water last summer.
Mendenhall' was neatly dressed and
looked well. If it hadn't been for the
handcuff s, which the considerable
Captain Tom." made as inobstrusive
as possible, nobody Would have sup
posed he was a prisoner. He talked
pleasantly with the few who recogniz
ed him at the station. - He said he
was glad of the prospect of going to
work in comparison with the tedium
of jail life. At the same time he said
that Sheriff Galloway, Jailer Chalker
and all others he came in contact with
hire had been very good to him, and
he was grateful for all their kind
ness. . .
Mendenhall has been a model pris
oner. He is a fine-looking man with
much personal magnetism, and people
who come in contact with - him are
naturally inclined to treat him well.
He is only about 45 years old, and
looks young, and if he is pardoned
out m ten years, as he probably will
be, ha wjll still be able to make much
out of life. . -V. '' :
The story of Mendenhall's crime is
well known. In company with Miss
Eliot and her mother, in a car driven
by Guy Semple, he left Tampa one
evening irt July. Late that night
Semple stopped men on the road near
Clearwater and told that Mendenhall
had made a murderous attack on the
two women and he had fled for his
life. The sheriff on Pinellas county
was notified and going to, the scene
found the ruins of the car and the
charred remains , of the women. Be
fore daylight, Mendenhall .was arrest
ed at his home in Clearwater, and has
been a prisoner ever since. '
Mendenhall was tried at Clearwater
and found guilty of murder with a
recommendation to mercy. Conse
uqently, he was sentenced-to prison
for life.
On the stand ' Mendenhall told a
feeble story in his own defense. Said
Miss Eliot shot herself and her moth
er, and that the chauffeur set fire to
the car and the bodies of the two
women in order to shield Mendenhall.
No one acquainted with the char
acters in the tragedy supposes that
Mendenhall committed a cold-blooded
murder. He had been intimate with
Miss Eliot, and she probably demand
ed more from him in return than he
was able to give. It is most likely
that going with her and her mother
on the ride, intending to gj.ve.her all
in his power, he was driven frantic
by her demands and killed fcfoth wom
en. Then he set the ar on fire in the
vain hope of destroying enough clues
to give him a faint i chance of ac
quittal. The story he told . on the
stand seems ridiculous, but it is pos
sible proof that in spite of his crime
considerable honor remained in him.
He could easily have told a story that
would have put the chauffeur in a bad
light, and might have shifted the
blame to his shoulders, f Menenhall
did not have the heart, or rather he
had too much conscience,' to do this;
consequently, he tried to save himself
without charging Semple with a grave
crime.

OCALA CAPITAL
Ifcc icll-iwing from the Scottsville,
Ky., Times tells of the work being
done by the Ocala Oil Company in Al
len county Kentucky. The said com
pany consists of Messrs; E. A. ; Os
borne and R. O. Huntsman, of Ocala,
W. H. McRainey, of Wildwood, I. A.
Hampton of Floral City, Walter Ray,
of Martel, and W. E. Baxley, of In
verness: ' ''.
Through, the courtesy of Mr. R. O.
Huntsman, manager of the, Ocala Oil
Company, the writer recently had the
pleasure of 'making a trip through the
Rodemer oil field. , ;
A quick run by automobile out the
Jackson Highway brought the party to
the railroad crossing, three miles south
of town, where the first well was
drilled in the Rodemer territory. This
original test well was the work of
ocal capital and owed its existence
to.; the initiative and the persever
ance of Earl C. Huntsman. It was
sunk three" years ago, and, with an
other well put down near by a little
ater is still being pumped. A pump
house and storage tanks stand beside
the railroad.7
A quarter of a mile down the rail
way track is the little station of
Rodemer. Here two sidings have been
put in since the oil field was opened.
The - first one, a spur accommodating
two cars, the Ramble Creek Oil Co.
naa to Duiia at its own expensce.
Later, when the Missouri-minded L. &
N. had been "shown," it laid a siding
holding 12 or 15 tank cars. Some
times both tracks are filled with cars
loading, at one time. :
On a tall hill, 250 yards back from
the switch, are three storage tanks,
the property of the Good Luck ' and
the White Plains oil companies. Their
combined capacity is 1900 barrels ;
and, as the railway tank cars hold
from 170 to 190 barrels each, it will
be seen that these reservoirs, when
full, will loan ten of the largest
transportation tanks. It is quick
work, the oil flawing by gravity thru
three-inch pipes. v -.
' Less than 100 yards away is one
of the oddities of the fieldone of
the earliest wells drilled, which failed
as an oil producer, but stands "full of
salt water. v;V Vi' ' ;: -, -
Proceeding a short distance up the
track from the-Rodemer, the visitor
is made aware, by other evidence
than the pipes alongside the railroad
and the all-pervading order of crude
oiL that there is "something doing"
nearby. Through the wood bordering
the railroad on the west, conies a
medley of sounds the snappy exhaust
of engines, the creak of pumps and
the dull, jarring thd of drills deep
down m the earth. Passing through j
the narrow skirt of timber, one enters;
open land, and finds himself in. the
midst of a busy oil field.
Mr. .Huntsman conducted the Times
man first over the workings of his
own company. Here, on a 12-acre '
lease, the Ocala people have seven'
producing wells. No. 7 had just been'
t Concluded on Fourth Page)

The railroad' officials stated that

by greatly inconveniencing the public

the main thoroughfares of the city,

Famous Confederate Raider Died in
Washington After a Long Illness
Nat the Age of Eighty-two
' ' (Associated Press) f
' - Washington, May 30. Col. John S.
Mosby, the famous Confederate raider
in - the war. between the states, died
here this morning after a long illness.
He was a native of Virginia, aged 82.
The 'funeral will be held at .Warren
ton, Va., but no time has been an
nounced. Mosby, who' had been em
ployed in the department of justice
for many years, resigned several
years ago. j
Physicians in attendance said that
Col. Mosby's death was due solely to
old age. He was conscious and inter-1
ested in what was going pn about him
ifhtil an hour before his death. The
funeral will probably be held Thurs
day. Members of Mosby's old com
mand will be pall bearers.
Col. Mosby dared death over fifty
years ago whenat the head of a band
of a few hundred Confederate raiders
he rode up and down the Shenandoah
valley, capturing outposts, destroying
supply trains, and cutting off means
of communication. It has been esti
mated that he often neutralized the
force of over 15,000 federals in the
valley. i "
Mosby's most brilliant exploit was
the capture of Gen. Stoughtoii, on a
March night in 1863, when he, 'with
30 followers, rode through , the fed
eral army to Fairfax courthouse, only
15 miles from Washington, where
Gen Stoughton was asleep. Although
surrounded by an army said o have
been 17,000 strong, the rangers calm
ly kidnapped the general, his staff
and many sentries, and turned them
over to the Confederate authorities at
Culpeper without having lost a man.
General Grant once later saved
Mosby from hanging, and two foes of
the battlefield became staunch friends.
Mosby stumped the state of Virginia
for Grant during his presidential
campaign, and was rewarded rwith an
appointment as consul at Hong Kong,
a post which he held for seven years.
He next became special land agent
for the government in Colorado, and
from 1904 to 1910 he was an attorney
m the department of justice.

Twice in the last twenty-four hours
the French have been compelled to
give ground. The weakers point in the
French line seems to be in the neigh
borhood of Cumieres, between the vil
lage and Dead Man's hill. The Ger
mans dented this line for' a distance
of more than 300 yards in the third
of a series of violent assaults yester-,
day., Last night they returned to the"
attack with Fresh 'divisions.
Paris admits the French were forc
ed to retire slightly along the Bethin-
coury-umieres road. . The German
attacks here were anbarentlv enuallerf
in violence along other sectors west of
the Meuse. According to the French
war office -the Germans were unable
tc gain elsewhere. Artillery fire in
the Fort Douaumont region east of the
river is reported.
Balkan advices show a continuation
of Bulgarian activity along the Mace

ported massing additional forces near
the Greek border at Novrokop and
Xanthia. Along the Vardar river the -entente

; A Rome dispatch through Paris de

Bulgarian advance through Greek
