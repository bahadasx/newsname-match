Pendleton is today paying tribute
to her dead.
Practically all business, official and
commercial, suspended either for the
whole or a part of the day, flags are
flying at half mast and this morning
a parade led the way to the cemetery
where under the direction of the p.
A. R. memorial exercises were held
The parade formed at 10 o'clock at
the court house. Led by the band
playing dirge music, it proceeded
slowly down Court to Main, south on
Main to Webb and tnence down Webb
to the cemetery.
In automobiles decorated with Am
erican flags and bunting, the veterans
of the Grand Army of the Republic,
rode Just behind the band. In an au
to truck rode the Women of Wood-
i alt "no many automorjues ionowea
j oenind with citizens, all Dearing flow
ers with which to decorate the graves.
Owing to the late spring the supply
of flowers available was shorter than
usual though many shipped in flow-
era from other places.
At the cemetery a large crowd was
assembled for decoration of the graves
and the program. The band opened
the exercises with a patriotic selec
tion. Captain I.hn Gurdane served as
presiding officer and the chief address
was given by Rev. G W. Rigby, now
blind. A prayer was given by Rev.
C. A. Hodshire and a vocal solo was
rendered by Mrs. Mae Hager. At the
conclusion a solo was given by Mr.
Thayer, a veteran.
Though there is a scarcity of flow
era here this year the graves are well
decorated and there are many re
marks as to the improved appearance
of the cemetery. Local fraternal or
ders decorated the praves of departed
members during the day.
