THE SMITH DIVORCE CASE.
The fact that a wife is living in a
county other than the residence of
her husband by agreement with him
and for some special reason, not
with the intention of severing their
marital relations, does not establish
the wife's place of residence in the
county in which she happens to be
dwelling for the time, said the court

press comment. Judge Gregory was
a guest at the Newspaper Mens' Club
and met many members of the edi
torial staffs of the various papers.
The Knave, a department of the Oak
land Tribune, has the following to
say regarding Judge Gregory:
"Judge Gregory of Oroville was in
town immediately after he pronoun
ced sentence upon the Rev. Madison
Slaughter. The judge is a quiet and
modest sort of man, who does not
advertise himself in any way, nor
give forth a sign that he "has been
through a notable judicial experi
ence. "His bearing is in keeping with the
impression that might have been
gained of him from the accounts of
the famous case over which he pre
sided. He is a dignified but not cap
tious magistrate, who was sure of
himself and generally cognizant of
what is seemly in legal proceedings.
"He doesn't talk much about the
case, further than to intimate that
Slaughter did not get any more than
was coming to him. The judge had
a hard session and his visit to San
Francisco is for a change of scene
and air, which constitute the impor
tant elements of a rest to forget
as far as it is possible the sordid and
salacious particulars of the celebra
ted case."
FOR CLOVER BLOAT.
At the request of The Grant Coun
ty News County Agent Fullerton of
Grant county has written the follow
ing instructions for prevention and
cure of the bloat: The Dutch or
White clover, called also old fash
ioned clover, is the chief miscreant.
Alsike, red clover and some other
clover are also bad but White and
Yellow Bloom Sweet clover are not
as dangerous. The chief danger is
when the clover is .cold. This causes
a sort of indigestion and formation
of gas causing death through suffo-.

ROOSEVELT IN KENTUCKY.
Impartial Poll Among Rads Shows
Interesting Situation.
(From Courier-Journal)
The following conclusions are
based on a straw vote of Kentucky
Republicans carefully conducted by
the Courier-Journal thru its corps of
correspondents in the State:
Sixty-thr,ee per cent of the Repub
licans of Kentucky are opposed to
the nomination of Colonel Roosevelt
for President, but only 18 per cent
of them will not vote for the man
who disrupted their party in 1912 in
the event he is nominated. Eight
per cent of the Republicans of the
State will vote for Wilson, should
Roosevelt receive the Republican
nomination and President. Wilson be
nominated at the hands of the Dem
ocrats. Thirty-seven per cent of
Kentucky Republicans favor the nom
ination of Colonel Roosevelt.
After deciding to test the . senti
ments of Kentucky Republicans on
the Roosevelt propositidn the Courier-Journal
communicated with each
of its county-seat correspondents,
sending each twenty ballots and in
structing him to distribute them
among the town and county Repub
licans, taking in all factions and giv
ing to no particular group the ad
vantage of doing all the voting.
Returns were made by all but
eight of the 120 correspondents, the
missing counties, being Bell, Bullitt,
Harrison, Knott, Livingston, Martin,
Spencer and Trigg. As a result
2,240 Republicans were heard from,
and of this number 825, or 37 per
cent expressed a preference for Col.
Roosevelt; 1,415, or 63 per cent, in
dicated their opposition to the Col
onel; 1,828, or 82 per cent, said they
would not vote for him under any
circumstances; 176, or 8 per cent,
indicated that they would vote for
President Wilson should Roosevelt
receive the Republican nomination.
Various reasons were given by
those opposing the nomination of
Roosevelt, the chief one being that
no recognition should be given a man
who did his best to wreck the party
in 1912. Another , reason was that
the' nomination of Roosevelt by the
tTtepublieans, might be taken- by"hot-i
Diooaea youth oi the country as an
inlication that a majority of Amer
icans are eager for war with Ger
many. On one of the many ballots re
ceived from out in the state was
written: '"Afraid of Big Stick." Yet
this Republican indicated that in the
event Roosevelt is nomniated by the
Republicans he would vote for him.
Returns from 26 of the 112 coun
ties heard from showed a majority
each for Roosevelt. These are Boyd,
Boyle, Breathitt, Galloway, Fayette,
Fulton, Garrard, Henderson, Hick
man, Hopkins, Jackson, Laurel, Les
lie, Letcher, Logan, McCracken,
Mercer, Monroe, Nelson, Oldham,
Pendleton, Powell, Rockcastle, Scott
and Woodford. In Hickman coun
ty all but one of the twenty Repub
licans interviewed expressed a pre
ference for the Colonel. In nine
counties the vote for and against
Roosevelt was equally divided.
The Mercer county correspondent
writes that "the most surprising fea
ture of the situation" in his county
"is that a number of men who were
active supporters of Taft four years
ago are now enthusiastic Roosevelt
supporters. Two prominent Repub
licans, while not favoring Roosevelt,
expressed the oponion that he would
be nominated."
Roosevelt is not nearly as strong
in Wayne county as four years ago,
according to the Courier-Journal
correspondent at Monticello. "This
is due," he writes, "to two reasons
resentment of his bolting the Chi
cago convention and a feeling that
we need a safer man under present
conditions. The Republicans here
are sticklers for party regularity and
.hesitate to bolt under any ordinary
condition, but I believe from my con
versations with them, that more will
vote for Wilson over Roosevelt than
indicated in my straw ballot returns."

Hard working people are most likely
to suffer from it. Relief may be had

is running, might just as well "take
his taw out." The Eighth district
is where Lud Petty, the Republican
State campaign chairman hails from
and it is conceded that he will have
the say-so who shall be put up there.
Mr. Florence is "in good" with the
Hitchcock element that is now run
ning things Republican in Kentucky
and that is about all he needs to get
the nomination in the Eighth district.

Best Thing:, for a Bilious Attack
On account of my confinement in
the printing office I have for years
been a chronic sufferer from indiges
tion and liver trouble. A few weeks
ago I had an attack that was so se
vere that I was not able to go to the
case for two days. Failing to get any
relief from any other treatment, I
took three of Chamberlain's Tablets
and the next day I felt like a new
man," writes H. C. Bailey, Editor
