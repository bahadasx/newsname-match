Veterans March to Arlington.
- From the Capital city of the great
nation they faced death to preserve?
the one great nation in the world at
peace today?they have marched?the ,
Mv score relics of the mighty army
that was invincible on many a blooddrenched
battlefield.
Under hallowed flags, rent with shot J
and shell and dimmed by the grime of
battle, carried proudly side by side
with new emblems that show thirteen
other states added to the Union they
preserved, they marched forth this
morning striving to hide the infirmities
that wounds and the years have
brought.
From this city that is the very
life-center of the Nation, whose people
crowded their line of march to cheer *
them along, this dwindling army turned
to that silent city across the Potomac <
on the sun-bathed hills of Arlington <
which will soon be their home, too ]
There they paid truest tribute or
respect. They crowded in reverent
visit about the tomb of the unknown,
who had given all to their country.
President Pays Nation's Tribute.
This afternoon President Wilson is
delivering the country's spoken word
of approval and thanks to these few
veterans. They are standing before j
him as a delegation from the Grand
Army of the Republic scattered through '
G. A. R. CONDUCT!
AT TOMB OF U1
AFTER PARAD
Wearied but happy, enjoying their I1
one great day of sad-glad-glorious ]
memories and recognition, a mere handful
of the mighty army that was musf
tered out ih the National Capital a ]
half century ago were marshaled at
noon today about the tomb of the unknown
dead in Arlington national cemetery.
They had completed their march of
pilgrimage to decorate with loving,
shaking hands the resting place of comrades
in arms who had passed away
in service leaving not even a name
by which their acme of self-sacrifice
might be proclaimed through the years
to come.
This remnant of the mighty Army of i
the Potomac started from Grand Army J
Hall. 14th and Pennsylvania avenue, at ]
&:30 o'clock this morning, with llag6
flung high, stepping forth proudly and
with all the briskness and eagerness
that the lilt of martial music could
provoke
They represented nine G. A. R. posts
and the Old Guard.
Let by the Marine Band, escorted by
a battalion of the District National
Guard, this thinned blue line started.

That message is going out from the

Grievances of the Men. *
The men's grievances, mentioned in ^
the letter sent yesterday to A. M. Kep- I
oft!. suDerintendent of the company, _
included the reinstatement of men *
who are alleged to have been recently C
discharged without cause, a slight in- j
crease in wages and, most particularly,
the permanent removal of "foremen 2
implicated in the extortion of money
from employes.*'
Employes stated that their reasons
for sending the letter are clearly set
forth in a pamphlet, entitled "Tribute {
Labor Must Pay," which, they say. discloses
a thorough system of graft and <
discrimination having for a long time .
been perpetrated by some of the of- 1
flcials of the company and which has j
been called to the attention of the cor- J
poration on more than one occasion.
This pamphlet contains a number of af- v
fidavits from employes, whs swear they (
had to pay officials, or go-betweens,
from $5 to $50 to obtain positions and
occasional extra suras to hold them.
Beady to Meet Walk-Out. ^
?
The company officials had taken steps *
to meet the walk-out, several train- J
loads of employes from New York, ]
Philadelphia and Baltimore having: arrived
at the Union station during the ^
night and early morning. The cars were {
parked in the yards, and "the station ?
chief of police, William E. Viet, "had i
sworn in a number of extra policemen
to keep order. Strikers this morning C
said that one carload of these "strikebreakers"
had refused to work and had
gone back whence they came.
Men in Holiday Mood. f
So far there has been not the slight- t
est disorder and the men were in more i
of a holiday mood than anything else. ^
Gathered before Typographical Temple
they displayed, with cheers, a banner ^
labeled "Carmen's Union" to all pass- t
ing street cars and vehicles and re- c
ceived answering applause. They took
pains to keep the sidewalks clear for f
pedestrians and otherwise to observe ^
not only the laws, but even the conventions.
The suggestion was made to \
Durchase two flags, those of the United
States and Italy, to have crossed on the
banner, and one of the committeemen t
signing yesterday's letter departed on t
this errand. 1
Shortly after that time Mr. Nolte ap- c
peared and was followed into the hail, t
where he called the meeting to order- t
He congratulated them on the way they ^
had handled themselves and on the
evident unanimity and determination
of their movement, and said that the
conditions under which thev had been
working was "an indictment against c
the National Capital." He stated that
Department of Labor officials had used L
every honorable means in their power e
to help adjust the differences, and y
warned them in decided phrases to do '
or say nothing that might reflect on e
their' movement or themselves. "Make e
it a clean fight." he added, and an- w
nounced that, inasmuch Me today is a e
holiday and no provisions have been 1<
made for a suitable place of meeting o
later in the day, the meeting would be r<
adjourned until tomorrow. e

A. M. Keppel. the superintendent of c

was meeting and would meet the new jr
conditions. The company has two ex- ir

man who has left, he stated. 01

interference with traffic. He remarked
on the fact that the companyhad
sixty-one men in the car shop, an 111
important branch, and of these but
three had walked out. and that out of
the fifty-eight left no fewer than fiftyone
were all union men.

that, were cars not properly inspected ai
