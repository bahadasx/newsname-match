REGEN
STEIN, HAMLETT
Sued For $80,623 By John C,
Duffy For Alleged Unau
thorized Expenditures.
IN STATE SUPT.'S OFFICE
First Fruits of Probe Into the
Expenditures of All De
partments. Frankfort, Ky., May 29. Three
suits to recover to the State school
fund from former State superintend
ents and their bondsmen an aggregate
of $80,623.42, were filed in the Frank
lin circuit court Saturday by Special
Assistant Attorney General John C.
Duffy.
He sued Barksdale Hamlett with
his bondsmen, Rufus H. Vansant and
D. W. Gardner,, together with the
widow and executor of the late John
C. C. Mayo, another bondsman, for
$64,711; J. G. Crabbe, with his bonds
man, Frank P. James, for $10,550.43,
and Ellsworth Regenstein, with the
National Surety Company, for $5,
361.09. The suit against Hamlett includes
salary alleged to have been illegally
drawn by him and his wife; alleged
unauthorized expenses allowed Ham
lett; the cost of alleged unauthorized
publications, and salaries of clerks
and stenographers, whose positions
the Court of Appeals held in a recent
test suit were not provided for by
law.
The salary of the State superintend
ent, acting as school inspector, was
increased by the 1912 General Assem
bly, and until February, 1913, when
it was held that Hamlett was not en
titled to the increase as it was made
during his term, he drew $1,395,
which is sued for.
Up to that time he had paid Mrs.
Hamlett as a clerk in the department
$1,000 annually and he then increased
it to $2,000. The petition prays the
recovery of the $6,916.67 received by
her, and in any, event the $2,916.67,
which she drew as an increase.
The petition alleges that Hamlett
illegally drew for himself as inspec
tion and contingent expenses $8,517.
50 during the four years of his term.
The alleged unauthorized expendi
tures for publications amount to $23,-
037.47.
J. G. Crabbe, who was elected in
1907, gave a blanket bond, with for
mer Auditor rranK v. dames on it.
He is' charged in the suit with $2,-
770.51 paid out for clerical salaries
not authorized by law; $2,672.26 paid
out of the school fund for alterations
in tho offices of the Department of
Education, which were originally in
tended for the Historical Society and
were ordered changed by the Capitol
Commission, provided tho expense
was borne by school fund, and with
$5,117.66 for alleged unauthorized
publications.
Ellsworth Regenstein, of Newport,
who was appointed State superintend
ent by Governor Willson, when Prof.
Crabbe resigned in 1910 to become
president of the Eastern State Nor
mal, gave bond of $25,000 in the Na
tional Surety Company. He is charged
with $816.60 expenses drawn by him
without itemizing his account; $3,-
045.39 for clerical salaries not au
thorized by law, and $1,400 for ex
penses of alleged unauthorized publi
cations.

Distant relatives of Wm. A. Wilgus,

leaving an estate of $40,000 to T. W.

terms of his will to the city, a-e seek
ing to break the will.
The estate was left to the city of
Hopkinsville for providing public
playgrounds for the white children.
No grounds are set up further than
that the will probated here "was not
the last will and testament." Furth
er, the petitioners pray that the city
be adjudged to have no interest in the
property whatever and that it be
turned over to them. The will left
all the property to Thomas W. Long,
closest friend of the deceased, for his
lifetime and at his death it was to be
used for providing playgrounds. Mr.
Long lived only n few weeks after
Mr. Wilgus died. The suit is direct
ed against George C. Long, adminis
trator, and the city of Hopkinsville.
The plaintiffs, who live in several
different states, are Sadie Wilgus
Yeager, Lucy Wilgus Luxon, Parma
Wilgus Bond, Tibbie Wilgus Prather,
Lucy Nutter Dennie, Charles Wilgus,

Artillery Duels Continue With

Moves.
RUSSIANS ARE ADVANCING
Austrians Pressing Italians
Hard and Taking Pris
oners.
London, May 29. Only artillery
bombardments have been in progress
on the French front around Verdun.
No infantry attacks have been made.
Around Le Mort Homme, northwest
of Verdun, and the sector west of the
Thiaumont farm, northeast of the
fortress, the bombardments have been
violent. In the Anronne forest the
French have captured craters caused
by the explosion of German mines
and in Alsace have put down an at
tempt of the Germans to advance. In
the fighting of Saturday nitrht the
Germans in the Champagne region at
several points penetrated the French
line and took 100 prisoners.
Petrograd reports an attempt of the
Germans in the Lake Drisviaty region
to start an offensive. The movement
was stopped by the concentrated artil
lery and infantry fire of the Russians.
The Austrians are still on the offen
sive against the Italians in the region
southeast of Trent, but Rome reports
that whatever infantry attacks were
started, Austrians met with repulse.
On the Isonzo front at San Michele
the Italians in mining operations de
stroyed Austrian trenches and took
the defenders of them under their
rifle fire as they fled.
Turkish contingents which tried to
advance against the Russians on the
Caucasus front in the region of Rivan-douza-Dergala,
were repulsed by the
Russians, according to Petrograd.
