Chicago, May 2'J.—Republican
Roosevelt headquarters were opened
in Chicago today by Herbert L. Fat
terloe and Lawrench Graham of New
York, and active work of getting dele­
gate votes for the candidates begun.
Tlie headquarters were opened sev­
eral hours before Col. Uoosevelt ar­
rived here, enroute to Kansas City,
where he is to deliver an address to­
morrow.
George von Meyer, formerly secre­
tary of the, ^avy, is expected in Chi­
cago tomorrow, to assume charge of
the pre-convention campaign for
Roosevelt. Indications are that the
plan of Mr. Hitchcock to have, the
name of Charles Hughes presented to
the national convention as the first
candidate may re'sulC in an. interest­
ing light between tl^.'. Hughes «iid
Roosevelt factions.
Teddy Stops Over.
Then. Roosevelt stopped in
Chicago
for four liours today on his way to
Kansas City, where he is to deliver
a memorial address. He was met at
the LaSalloj fitation by a. cheering
crowd, iviuAh Ithronged about his train
ho closely iifihat the committee which
met him had trouble in escorting liirr:
to the automobile which was to carry
him to his hotel.
At the hotel, Col. Roosevelt made
an address in the lobby, in which lie
referred to the cordiality of his re­
ception and reiterated views he had
previously expressed on national pre­
paredness. He entered on confer­
ences with party leaders upon reach­
ing his room. These were broken
only by calls from members of the
committee.
ARE SIM
Fargo, N. D., May 29.—Non-partisan
league candidates are scarce in Cass
county. With the closing of the filing
period today only four legislative can­
didates, three of them democratic,
are backed by the league.
In the city of Fargo district, three
republican candidates, the choice of
the business men of the city, are un­
opposed for nominations. One of the
representative candidates for the
league is democratic, while a com­
plete legislative ticket has been put
forth in the Eleventh district, with
democratic senatorial and represent­
ative candidates and one republican
representative candidate bearing the
league endorsement.
This district is overwhelmingly re­
publican.
Beach Plans
Big Time
Beach, N. D., May 29.—There is evi­
dently going to be "something doin'"
in Beach on the Fourth of July, judg­
ing from the sticker reading "Villa
May be at Beach July 4" that was
gotten out by the entertainment com
«nitee. It may not turn out to be as
big a joke as it appears to be on first
reading for several of the local movie
actors have declared their intention
to have Villa as a captive in the big
parade.
The citizens of Beach are quite elat­
ed over the fact that the Red Trail
pathfinders found the best strip of
road on the trail throu Golden Valley
county. This will be quite an induce­
ment for many people from neighbor
inging towns along the Northern Paci­
fic, to come. There will also be many
visitors from the south branch. Elab­
orate preparations are being made for
a "reg'lar ol' fanshioned Fourth" and
Beach is confident that it's committee
of live-wires will carry out the pro­
gram.

Washington, May 29—State Depart­

fied today over the failure of the
new note from Gen. Carranza to reach
the department or the Mexican em­
bassy. The department advices in­
dicated it was to be expected yester­
day. ,.
Manuel Mendez, the foreign office
attache, from Mexico City, who was
supposed to be acting as special mes
sengor, arrived today, but declared
he had no knowledge of the note what­
ever, and merely had come to Wash­
ington on a vacation. JSlisio Arre
dondo, the Mexican ambassador, des­
ignate, with whom Mendez conferred,
stated nonp of his messages frointhe
foreign office contained any mention
of anew notes. Mr. Arredondo made
no appointment at the state depart­
ment today, but as tomorrow is a
holiday, it is certain the note will not
be presented until Thursday, should it
arrive tomorrow or Wednesday.

Mobilizing at CHihuahua
Rumors transmitted by border mili­
tary commanders as matters of in­
formation for the war department said
that 22,'QO0' Carrafiza troops were mo­
bilized near Chihuahua City. Another
rumor said that Mexico papers quot­
ed Luis Huerrera as saying he. was
ready to attack Americans if they did
not withdraw from Mexico by June
1st. Special Agent Rogers has men­
tioned this report.
Encamped Near Troops.
Reports brought here tonight by ar­
rivals from the front said that a num
bbr of small bands of bandits have
been encamped to the rear of Gen. J.
J. Pershing's rear post. One report
placed them within 15 miles of the
American columns.
At military headquarters nothing
was known of the report, which, it is
pointed out, may have originated
with the movement of the Carranza
troops pursuing the bandits in the
vicinity of the Americans.
Will Recruit Militia.
Authorization from the war depart­
ment was obtained today to recruit
the militia of the units now in the
service to war strength. Recruiting
agents wil be sent to the towns
where the various companies were
organized and there the people will
be given the first opportunity to en­
roll those lacking to bring each com­
pany to 150 men. It is expected the
plan will add to the forces along the
border approximately. 1500 men.
S. D. DELEGATES

bach, who will work from the repub­
lican headquarters of the South Da­

Interesting Suit Concluded
ui
Federal Court Other
.$ Business.
An interesting case, and one that
has attracted a deal of attention of
late, was cleared up in the United
States federal court yesterday. Peter
Roth was the defendant in the case
and suit was brought against the de­
fendant to secure the cost of a span
of horses, which were picked up as
estrays by him and sold. Some in­
teresting details were brought out
during the progress of the trial and
at the conclusion it was decided that
Roth would be paid for caring for
the team during the time they were
in his custody and the United States
will receive $1 and costs for their
interest in the matter.
An Indian lost the aforementioned
span of horses some time ago, and
for 18 months neither saw nor heard
of his lost horses. The team was
picked up on the prairie by Roth and
advertised by him as such. After
keeping them for one year, he auc­
tioned them off and saw to it that he
secured the horses at his own figure.
The many details brought out in
this case were very interesting to
those interested and were finally
cleared up satisfactorily to all con­
cerned.
Civil Case Concluded.
A civil case, in which the Golden
Valley I,and ahd Cattle company and
the United States Fidelity and Guar­
anty company were the parties in in­

of those concerned.

GIVES HIM CREDIT
FOR ITS SUCCESS
St. Paul, Minn., May 29.—That ab­
solute control of the First. National
bank of St. Paul passed from James
J. Hill to his soil, Louis VV. Hill, two
weeks ago, became known today, fol­
lowing the death of James J. :Hill.
The First. National bank has com­
bined capital and surplus «of $5,000,
000 and more than $54,000,000 in de­
posits, which makes the institution
the second largest west of the Missis­
sippi river. Mr. Hill had planned a
great future for the bank and his son
will carry out the policy. In passing
over control of the bank, Mr. Hill
told his son that he was more respon­
sible for its rapid growth than any
person, including himself, and that
his son was entitled to the reward of
his efforts.
At. the time Mr. Hill gave his son
control of the institution, he trans­
ferred his stock to him'.
Morgan Pays
Hill Tribute
New York, May 29—"One of the
strongest, men of his generation," was
the characterization by J. P. Morgan
of Mr. Hill.
"Mr. Hill's death is a great loss to
the country," said Mr. Morgan. "He
helped more than any other man in
the development of the great regions
in the northwest. He commanded the
respect, and admiration of all for his
great constructive and executive abil­
ity, and fine integrity of character,
which made him one of the strongest
men of his generation. His friend­
ship and kindness to my father and
myself through many years makes me
feel his loss particularly keenly."

James J. HiU Discovered
"The Breadbasket of the"
World" in Great Northwest
Story of How a Poor Irish-Canadian Far­
mer Boy Became the Greatest Rail­
road Builder of His Time His Life
Intimately Linked With Devel
opment of the Northwest.
James J. Hilt discovered "The breadbasket of the world" in the Great
Northwest:
he led in its development from a wilderness into what now com­
prises six wealthy states dotted with 400,000 farms
and he biased a trail for transportation which reached
eventually from Buffalo to Asia, with a total mileage of
rail and steamship facilities that would nearly girdle
the earth.
Born In Canada.
That but roughly spans the story of his achieve­
ment.
Near Guelph, in Ontario, where James J. (Jerome)
Hill was born in 1838, the son of an Irish-Canadian
farmer who died when the boy was 1", there stands a
tree stump labeled: "The last tree chopped by James
J. Hill."
It marked the lad's resolution to g« to the United
States. He had been prompted by an odd incident, ac­
cording to the story that is told, a strange traveler had
stopped at the 'Hill farm to take dinner, and left his
horse at the gate. Young Hill saw the animal was tired
and he carried it a pail of water. The stranger was
pleased with the lad's thoughtfulnoss, and as he drove
off he tossed him a newspaper from the United States,
and callc4 out gravely:
And He Oid.
"(jq.v.hcirc, young man. That country needs young­
sters spirit."
Hfll-,8Sid the paper carefully. It contained glowing
accounts of opportunities•AVjffl'P States. Ho resolved to investigate for him­
self. was the next morning,that he chopped his last tree.
As a mere roustabout lad of 18, he
loured from Maino to Minnesota.
,r
•ft
When, in ISuti, he disembarked from
a Mississippi river packet at St. Paul
that place was a frontier town of
r,000
inhabitants. At the sign of W. J.'Bass
ft Co., agents for the Dubuque & St.
Paul Packet. Company, he found a Job
stevedore-and clerk. r~
Seized Every Opportunity.
In tlio fifteen years that followed he
seized •pwr$'gpportunity toj study the
rivei\trHjjtepociation.
He gafchifo^ end of ^SMpionce apd
a little capital with ^vhich m. launched!
his dwn firm of Hill, Grass & Co..
which promptly displayed its initiative
by bringing the first load fif cotfl (that
had ever been seen in that sedtion
into St. Paul. Two years later, with
a flat-bottomed steamer he establish­
ed the first regular communication
with St. Paul and the Manitoba ports
of the fertile Red River Valley.
Streaks of Rust.
At about that time St. Paul was hav.
ing its first experiment in railroad
building. Eighty miles had been laid
to St. Cloud, 16 miles to Brecken
ridge, both of which terminals were
at the southern end of the Red River
Valley, and there were about 100 miles
of track "which began nowhere ant
ended in that same indefinite spit."
This venture ran up a debt of $33,000,
04)0 and collapsed, with its only assets
being "a few streaks of rust and a
right of way."
Hill had had sufficient success in
the region to be seized with a con­
suming desire to purchase the defunct
property. After five years of financial
dickering, including the sale of all his
other interests, which netted a for­
tune of $100,000, he and a syndicate
of three others—Sir Donald A. Smith,
George Stephen, and Norman' W. Kitt
son,—obtained
the object of this de­
sire.
Without Subsidy.
The St. Paul. Minnesota and Mani­
toba Railway was formed to operate
the property, with Hill as general
manager. When in 1883 Mr. Hill was
elected president he undertook the ex­
tension of the road from its Dakota
and Minnesota homesteak to the Paci­
fic ocean. He was confronted by
three great competitors to the south,
each of which had received big bon­
uses as government aid, whereas the
"Manitoba" or the Great Northern, as
it came to be known, did not have a
dollar of government subsidy or an
acre of grant to forward its progress
from the Minnesota boundary to the
sea. W«»
In this light, Hill's plan was widely
deemed pure folly, but he pressed It
to conclusion by building and populat­
ing as he built. Tor several years he
laid rails westward at the rate or a
mile a day, and at a cost of $30,000
a mile, and as he went he left a trail
of embryonic farms by the railside.
Turned Empire Builder.
With the line to Puget Sound once
laid, he turned Empire Builder. He
introduced the live stock industry into
vast areas of bunch-grass plains, and
developed them by importing blooded
stock he sent demonstration trains
through the country with men who
showed the people how to raise more
wheat to the acre. He made an outlet
for the grain by establishing a cheap
rate by rail and steamship to Buffalo
where he built great elevators in fact
for upwards of 20 years he left noth­
ing in his power undone to develop
the country where he had staked otft
his claim as the great common car­
rier.
But at the Pacific tide-water he was
