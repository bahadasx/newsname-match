BOAT HOUSES ALONG
LAKE SHORE MAY BE
CONDEMNED BY CITY
Because boat houses along the lake
shore allow rubbish, dead fish, weeds,
etc., to accumulate on the lake shore,
the city may condemn all' the boat
houses and order that they be
moved.
Several complaints were made dur
ing the past few days on account of
the stench of the accumulation caused,
by the boat houses forming' a
"pocket" along the lake shore, mak
ing it impossible for the wind to wash
the accumulation away.
The city paid several hundred dol
lars last year to have the shore
cleaned
The board of health is investiga-
that the boat houses will be ordered
condemned immediately.

SPEEDWAY RACE TODAY
St. Paul, Minn., May 30.A Be
midji constructed automobile is en
tered in the first motor races of the
season to be staged at the Twin City
Speedway this afternoon.
The car is owned by C. W. Jeweit
and is named "Bigmidg." It is a
little red go-devil constructed from
a Ford and yesterday it did the
course in wonderful time. It will
undoubtedly be a strong contender
for the money in the 50-mile race.
Jewett will drive the car.
Six races are on the program
with a 50-mile feature event, while
two motorcycle races and aviation
stunts by Ruth Law are also sched
uled as additional features. The first
event of the program will start at
1:30 and the races will be run off
in rapid succession so that the card
may be finished well before 5:30.

Indianapolis Speedway, May SO.
The interest of the big crowd filling
grandstand, bleachers and infield at
the speedway here today centered in
the attempted comeback of Louis
Chevrolet, the lone surviving mem
ber of the famous team that made au
tomobile racing history in 1908-09-

famous speed devils, faced the starter
in the sixth annual international
sweepstakes 300-mile dash over the
speedway of vitrified brick.
Chevrolet's two teammates have
crossed the great divide. Louis
Strang was killed while driving a

NEW NYMORE ROAD
MAY RUN BETWEEN
SECOND AND THIRD
Mnnesota & International Railway
Submits New and Best
Proposition.
CITY COUNCIL NAMES FIVE APPRAISERS
Committee Appointed to Confer With
Railway Officials and
Report.
The Minnesota & International
railway in an effort to co-operate
with the city to secure the best route
for the new proposed Nymore high
way and to evade litigation has sub
mitted a new proposition to the city
council.
One of Best.
The new proposition is believed to
be one of the best submitted. It is
an agreement to give the city the
right of way along the lake shore
if the city will not open up Second
street but will construct a street 120
feet north of Second street, or mid
way between Second and Third
streets. Under the new proposition
the road would cross no railway
tracks.
Committee Named.
At a meeting of the council last
evening the new proposition was dis
cussed and upon motion of Alderman
Bailey, the street committee, con
sisting of Aldermen Smart, Phillippi
and Ervin, Alderman Lycan, City At
torney Russell and City Engineer
Swinson were appointed to confer
with railway officials and report to
the council at a special meeting next
Monday evening.
Appraisers Named.
The council in acting upon Net resO
Iution passed at the last meeting
for the constructing of the highway
on Second street, named five apprais
ers. The appraisers are requested to
report in two weeks as to the value
of the property along the proposed
Second, street route. This is the
route that the railway company is
opposing.
The appraisers named are Charles
Warfield, A. P. White, R. K. BJiler
and John Kroon.
Letter in Part.
The letter from W. H. Gemmell
to the city council, outlining the new
propositions of the M. & I. railway,
in part, is as follows:
1. If the city council decides
they will continue to use Beltrami
avenue extended to the railway
tracks and the present crossing,
merely building a permanent bridge
of the proper height, we will co-op
erate with them in every way we
reasonably can by making track
changes so that, if practicable, there
will be only one railroad track to
cross, keeping the crossing planked
up in proper shape at all times and
adopting and using such safety de
vices as to the city council shall seem
requisite and necessary.
"2. If the council decides that it
will abandon the present crossing
and location of the bridge and build
a .new bridge and go along the lake
front at least as far as the north
end of our property in lot A, which
is about 120 feet north of the north
side of Second street extended, I will
recommend to our owners that we
will give the city free of charge an
easement for roadway purposes con
sisting of a strip of right-of-way as
wide as they ask up to 80 feet the
same to commence 20 feet from the
rear of existing warehouses the city
in return to vacate the crossing from
the present bridge west.
"If plan number two is adopted, it
is possible that the railway company
could be of some use to the city Jn
doing the work along the lake front

by the loan of tools or otherwise, and
I would be glad to discuss that phase
pf the situation with the proper par
ties in due course and see if we can
help them out in any way."
300 Sign Petition.
It was pointed out at the meeting
of the council last evening that about
300 citizens had petitioned the city
to construct the new Nymore high
way to Third street. It is believed
that this new proposition will be sat
isfactory to them.
Several of the aldermen spoke very
favorably of the new propositions of
the railway and urged that since it
appeared that the railway company
was ready to do the right thing that
the city should do the fair thing. By
accepting the new proposition of the
railway company there would be no
litigation over the right of way for
the highway.
Second Hand Auto.
At the council meeting on motion
of Alderman Smart the city clerk was
authorized to advertise for bids for
a second hand automobile for the use
of the city engineer
The city attorney was instructed
to request to Great Northern railway
to make its crossing west of the
Blakeslee farm conform with the Soo
railway crossing
An amendment to the fire ordinance
exempting the east half of block 12
from the limits was read.

Chippewas have not lost any interest
in it but steadily it has increased so
that not only the Chippewas of Min
nesota but Indians of other tribes
