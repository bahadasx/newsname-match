HARD STRUGGLE
ENDSJN DEATH
Master William Taylor Fltzpatrick
Dies at Lexington Hospital
Sunday Morning.
Little William Taylor Pitzpat
rick, Jr., aged seven years and
known affectionately as "Teddy,"
who had been at the Good. Samari
tan. Hospital for' the past two
weeks suffering' with an ailment
that hauled the physicians and
speululisis, died Sunday mumlug ut
4:30 o'clock.
Tho child was operated on sev
eral times, the Inst time his right
leg being removed but to no avail.
He suffered with something that
appeared to be chills almost hourly
and his system. seemed filled with
poison. His case was one of the
njost bnflling ones the physicinns
have had in years.
"Teddy" was a bright, manly lit
tle chap loved by all who knew him
and Mr. and Mrs. Fitzpntrick have
the heartfelt sympathy of the en
tire1 community in the loss of their
only child.
Only the memory of the lovely
child is left, yet how sweet, how
uplifting its influence. For, after
nil, death is but the slipping off of
tho outer body. The taking away
of this child has left a sad home,
but tho memories thereof can fancy
his awaiting them in the place pre
pared for him, u little apart from
the innumerable company in bright
array; perhaps in one of the
' Palaces of ivory
Its vindows.cry&taXijcIcan"
of which' old' Bonur,, quaintly sung.
In the light, not of the sun, neither
of the moon, we sec him beyond the
fields of fadeless asphodel, under
the waving palms, beside the still
waters bordered with silver lilies.
These may be merely figures, but
thoy bear- a precious meaning to
yonrning henrts made for the deep
household loves; hearts that will
not be comforted because the' An
gel of the House is missing.
"Then fell upon the house a sudden
gloom,
A shadow on those features fair
and thin;
And softly, from that hushed and
darkened room,
iwo angels issued wlierc hut one
went jn."
Funeral services were conducted
Monday afternoon at 5 o'clock by
Rev. E. L. Southgato of the Meth
odist church, assisted by Rev. Clyde
Darsie of the Christian church,
with burial in Machpelah cemetery.
Tho Advocate extends sincorc sym
pathy to tho bereaved parents.

STREETS TO BE IMPROVED
As will be seen by tho ordinance
appearing on another pngo of this

the following streets paved with
asphalt, brick or similar material:
Locust, from Wilson nllcy to Qucch
street; Main, from Wilson nllcy to
Willow street; Sycamore, from the
C. & O. Railroad to Holt nveauo.
and High street from Broadway to
Elm street. This will probably be
over a milo of paving and is the
largest single contract tho city has
yet ordered. Holt avenue, Clay
street, Howard avenue and Wcsl
Locust street will be macadamized
as the owners of property on them
preferred macadam and the Coun

prove the streets. This is more
street improving than was ever at

pected this fall will see the streets
of Mt. Sterling in tho best condi
tion ever known.
