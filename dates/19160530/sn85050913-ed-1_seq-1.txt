The address off Attorney General
CoBSOii, republican candidate for
governor, at the court house Friday
evening, was listened to by a small
audience, there being about sixty
present. The speaker was deserv
ing of a wider hearing. He made a
very good impression upon his audi
tors and discussed the issues of the
campaign In a straightforward and
Impassioned manner. O. J. Hender
son introduced the speaker In his
usual pleaslngs^manner.
J\
Mr. Cosson dealt in no "glittering
generalities," but maintained his ar
guraent by freqiient reference to the
record. He took issue with Hon. W.
L. ilarding, also a republican candi
date for governor, upon several Im
portant points raised by Mr. Hard
ing, who recently attacked the prin
ciple of having commissions to en
force certain laws. Mr. Cosson show
ed that but for the interstate com
merce commission, which took
years of hard effort to. es
tablish, the fight being led
by such well known statesmen as
Senator Dolllver and President
Roosevelt, the railroad legislation
entoWd'.rtttilftfc the incumbency of
Roosevelt, which protected the peo
jle from unjust demands of big ship
pers like 'the-Standard Oil company,
would have been of little public ben
efit. He also defended the industrial
commission of Iowa, which commis
sion, under the direction of Gov
Garst and later Senator Funk, had
accomplished much in the interest of
the wage earners of the state. The
national pure food commission, an
pther commission created .under the
leadership of President Roosevelt,
aided by Senator Dolllver, has also
been prolific of' much good and has
served the people well. The speak
er named a number of other commis
sions that had fully vindicated their
existence by the records matle.
The attorney general said Mr.
Harding was trying to confuse the
road issue by insinuating that he
.(the. 'attorney general) wanted to
force paved roads upon the farmers
of the state. Mr. Cosson declared
that he was in favor of good roads
and wiynted the people of the var
ious counties to have the kind of
roads they desired. To that end-he
was In favor of permitting them to
issue bpnds, same as they do for
school houses, court houses, etc., first
submitting the question to a vote of
the electorate.
Mr. Cosson attacked the temper
ance and other reform records of the
lieutenant governor. He declined to
say that Mr. Harding is for the wets
but declared unequivocally that the
wets are for Mr. Harding, and he
sustained this proposition from the
record demonstrating that the wets
had go«d foundation for their con
fidence. In the election of 1914, Mr.
Harding-dead the attorney general in
the wet river counties by more than
5,000.rotes, white in.eighty counties
of the state the' attorney general led
Hhe lieutenant governor. Here in
the'Tenth Mr. Harding carried Car
roll and Crawford county, both wet,
while the attorney general carried
the balance of the district The leg
islative record was then called up
as a witness and the record showed
that the attorney general eitheT vot
ed against hearly all measures cal
culated to curb the saloon or failed
to vote at all The Freeman-Trib
une cannot recall just what bills Mr.
Cosson referred to in showing the
tendency of Mr. Harding to remain
loyal to the Bo-called liberal element,
but he certainly proved his case. He
might have cited the record as fol
lows:
In* the Thirty-Second general as
sembly Mi).'Harding failed to give
bis support to the bill requiring pub-
llcation before saloon consent peti
tions were circulated, and the bill
making it an indictable offense to
sell, give or procure intoxicating
liquors to minors or drunkards. In
the Thirty-Third general assembly
Mr. Harding did not give his sup
port- to the Roe white slave bill and
voted against the bill reducing the
hours that saloons might remain
open. He did not favor the Ham
mond red light bill and voted agahist
the Joint prohibition constitutional
amendment.
In the Thirty-Fourth general as
sembly he voted against the five mile
limit bill and again vot«d against tho
bill reducing the hours of the open
saloon.
Mr. Harding voted for some temp
erance bills but his record shows
that he favored (be liquor traffic in
many instances.
In closing Mr. Cosson made a
strong plea in favor of universal suf
frage, leaving no question of his at:
tltude upon that issue.

Weights Stolen.
JeWell, May 27.—Last night some
body stole the sliding weights at the
stockyards of the Northwestern Rail
road company in this place, causing
a lot of inconvenience to stockmen.
The weights are of little valufe only
for the brass they are made of. Tl)is
is (he second time these' weights
have been stolen within the past
two months.
To' Build Fine Home.
Mrs. H. E. Schroeder has bought
of Geo. S. Barner the residence lot
at the corner of Willson avenue and
Walnut Btreet and- will erect there
on this summer a modern home of
the bungalow' type. This is probably
the most valuable vacant residence
lot In the city and the price paid is
12,760. It has paving on both sides,
sidewalks, sewerst etc., and Is, In the
judgment of the Freeman-Tribune,
worth the price. .,—--

Col. Thatcher Coming.
Col. Clifcs. W. Thatcher, the eccen
tric founder of the Washington high
way who held forth upon the busi
ness streets of Webster City late last
fall upon the gospel of good roads,
will be, in this ctyy again about July
30th. Many will recall Col. Thatch
er's nondescript outfit consisting of
a light buckboard and badly Match
ed team with rope harness, tin ket
tles and buffalo skulls tied on the
re^r of the wagon, etc. Col. Thatch
er travels in this manner to attract
attention, using the infallible prin
ciple that it is the upusual always
that attracts the attention of the
people. President Perry of the Com
mercial League yesterday received a
letter from Col. Thatcher announc
ing his intentions to visit this city
in the Interest of a coast to roast
highway which will start at Wash
ington $nd which Webster City resi
dents will hope will go through this
city. Extracts from Col. Thatcher's
letter are as follows:
"I will not be ablo to reach your
city quite as soon aB I expected' but
I will come about July 31th. Invite
delegations to be present for fifty
miles east and fifty miles west, over
the proposed route. The Washington
highway's progress since my visit to
your city has been, marvelous. Wash
ington Highway gospel has been ex
tended for one thousand miles south
and east or Chicago. I am at pres
ent returning from North Carolina.
Generous bond issues have been vot
ed all along the line for road con
structions. Busy road camps are
now at work blasting and grading to
moderate levels away from the
Washington Highway through the
mountains of Kentucky, Tennessee
and North ^Carolina. Rousing meet
ings have been held over the route.
I was honorary guest at a banquet at
Jeffersbn City, Tenn., a few nights
ago. On Monday night I addressed
an audience at the regular meeting
of the county court room. The Lieut.
Gov. of Kentucky was an enthusias
tic listener. I will attend a great
Washington Highway event in Col
umbus, Ohio, June 20th. Present in
dications point to a rock or concrete
paved Washington highway from
Chicago to South Florida inside of
two years. Let us start the hall rol
ling for a concrete paved -road over
the Washington Memorial Highway
in the near future. By right boost
ing, your section of Iowa will be put
aflame for good roads.

Yours truly,

Webfcter City Nationals are Defeated
by Scorc of 4 to 3 at River-
r-
side Park.
A home run by Coleman, the All
Ration catcher in the eighth inning,
and the use of 'Donaldson, the star
pitchcr for the remainder of the
game, proved the undoing of the lo
cals at Riverside park Friday af
ternoon l|y a scorc of 4 to 3. ThiB
game was by all odds the best exhi
bition of the national..game put up
by the home team so far,this season,
and it was merely horse shoe luck
that gave^ the game to the visitors)
A large crdwd was present.
In the first inning for the All Na

tripled to right field Hernandez
struck out, and Wheeler gulled out

ter Coffin was out on an infield
drive, which -scored Mac. Williains
was out at first unassiBted.
In the first of the third frame,
Blatner singled Donaldson batting
for Terino was safe on a fielder's
choice, but' Blatner was cut down at
second. Steno struck out Donald
son stole second and third in succes
sion Evans walked and in an at
tempt to hold Evans on first, Don
aldson was safe at the plate on a
poor throw from first. Hernandez
struck out.
Sweeley, first up for the locals,
singled Blades 'singled Hellrich
walked Wheeler then smashed a
double to left scoring Sweeley and
Blades, but Hellrich attempting to
score was caught at home Leichtner
struck out St. John filed out to left
field. This ended the locals scoring
for the game.
In the 7th, Blatner for the All Na
tions struck out Donaldson- iyaa safe
on an error Steno walked Evans
was out, pitcher to first but Hernan
dez doubled, scoring Donaldson and
Steno, and tieing (he score Mendez
struck out.
Coleman, first up for the visitors
in the eighth, cinched things by a
mighty l{ive o^tfr the west fence for
Tour bases.
Torino, the first box artist used b)'
the visitors, was'gVven a warm re
ception and lasted hut two innings.
Mendez, Cuban wonder, then lasted
until the eighth, when the visitors
went into the lead and just to play
safe Donaldson was put in to finish
the game.

FLAM WEEK
IS INNOVATION
Electric Shop to Put on Sale of Elec
trio Irons Unprecedented
Here Before.
Supt. Long of the elecfric light
and power plant will during the
week beginning June 12th, put on a
sale at the electric shop which is un
precedented in this city. This will
be a sale of electric flatirons, the
best to be bought anywhere, at $1:50
each.
These irons have heretofore re
tailed at $3.^0 each and the electric
department will lose money at that
price, but the sale has been institut
ed for the purpose of getting the
electric current into every home in
the city. With the present reduced
rates of electricity to the consumer,
it will be cheaper to Iron by electric
ity than by any other method, and
the labor at the same time greatly
lightened during hot weather. It is
planned to place at least 250 of these
irons In homes during the week.
"Damaged Goods."
"Damaged Goods" is a mighty pro
test against the double standard in
morals as it exists in modern society
today. It is a moving picture film
which will be shown at the Orpheum
tomorrow, May 30th.
We are not yet accustomed to un
veil the secrecy that enshrouds our
discussion of sex-problems. But the
time is probably 'coming when we
will view this subject with an open
mind and clear conscience.
It is only those who come direct
ly in contact with the actual hor
rors infesting every city—and Web
ster City is not immune—that real
ize how valuable is the instruction
to be derived from this film.
Parents are too often ignorant of
the conditions surrounding their sons
and daughters ta early manhood and
womanhood. Perhaps If they were
aware that the taxes which they are
compelled to pay for the building
and maintenance of insane asylums,
schools for.^he deaf, dumb and blind
and homes for the imbeciles, are nec
essary more than for any other rea
son because of acts of indiscretion
during youth, they would then inter
est themselves in every possible way
in the moral protection of these be
loved ones. It is astounding to know
that the cost of supporting these in
stitutions, together with jails and
other reformatories, Is five times
that of maintaining our educational
system and yet there are some who
hold up their hands in protest
against the public instruction of sex
ology. Those who take that'view
should see "Damaged Goods."
Three Picnics.
The class who have just graduat
ed from the high school held a picnic
in ^okomis park Friday night. Near

lunch was eaten about six o'clock
and the quiet beauty of the spot en
joyed until dark.
A goodly number of the Juniors of
the Baptist church held a pleasant
picnic Friday night in Nokomis
park in honor of Mervin and Dorothy
Clark, who expect soon to move away
from this city.
The
lunch which
was taken to the park was stolen, so
that feature of the evening was lack
ing, but the children, accompanied
by G. W. Steep, came back to the city
and together attended one of the
picture shows.
With W. W. Cole Show.
The following item is from the
Daily Chicago Tribune of a few days
ago and relates to one of tlie feature
acts with the W. W. Cole Show
which appears in this city on June
8, 9 and 10, under the auspices of
the local Elk lodge as a charity bene
fit:
Sappho, a young mov|e actress,
was the guest of honor at an after
noon tea given at the Lincoln park
zoo yesterday by Cy De Vry. It was
"at home" day in the leopards' cage,
and Sappho, who is a member of the
same family, had the time of her life.
Sappho is the pet of Princess Olga
Celeste, a wealthy native of Russia
who makes a hobby of wild animals.
The Princess, who with her half doz
en trained leopards has been acting
in the movies for the Sellg Polyscope
company in California, stopped off in
Chicago on her way to South Amer
ica. Mr. De Vry invited her to bring
Sappho out to the pa.rk to visit with
his spotted family, and while the tea
party was punctuated at times by the
catty remarks of those present every
thing went off without a serious row
or physical encounter.
The princess carried Sappho in her
arms in the automobile which con
veyed the guests to the zoo. Sappho
has been so thoroughly tamed and
trained the princess leads her about
with a leash attached to a harness.
The camera man for the Selig
Tribune weekly was among those
present, and pictures of the tea par
ty will be shortly seen on the screen.
Advices received in this city froin
Mrs. Minnie Bone, who for three
years has been teaching near Pros

state that she has been elected for
next year aB principal of the school
at Kenewlck, Wash., at an increase
of salary. Mrs. Bone will arrive at
Carroll, la., in one week to spend
her summer's vacation between that
city and Webster City.
E. E. Mason has let the contract

erected on south Prospect street this
summer. J. P. Rasmussen and son
Levi are the contractors and the
home, which will cost in the neigh
borhood of $4,000, will be of frame

Gubernatorial Candidate to Visit a

Politics Next Saturday
Afternoon.
MAKING AN AUTOMOBILE TOUR
To Speak in Woolstock, Webster
City, Kamrar, Jewell, Stanhope
and Stratford.
Senator Joseph H. Allen of Poca
hontas, republican candidate for gov
ernor
of
Iowa, is making an automo­
bile tour
of
the state, meeting vot­
ers and giving his views of the polit
ical issues of the day. He is making
many friends and it 1b certain that
he will be well toward the winning
goal when the primary votes are
counted. His friends and supporters
believe he will secure the nomina
tion and election. He Is one of the
strong men of the state and comes
from a section that is deserving of
recognition from the republican par
ty, as it always rolls up a big major
ity for the ticket and has never yet
been honored with the governorship.
When northwestern Iowa presents
such man as Joseph H. Allen for
this great office this section of the
state has a right to expect that he
will be nominated. He has-been in
the legislature many years. His rec
ord is an open, book and those who
study it will find that he has been
on the side of progress and reform in
every instance. His itinerary in this
vicinity next Saturday afternoon is
as. follows:
WoolstoeH at 1:30, Webster City

hope 3:45, Stratford 4:15.
No Survey for Hamilton
Jewell Record: Warren, Lucas,
Marion, and Monroe counties are the
four counties in Iowa that are to
get the farm survey work by the
college at Ames this summer. The
Jewell Commercial Club made appli
cation last spring to have Hamilton
county included in the list of four
counties that\are to get this valu
able work thife summer, hut failed to
make a sufficiently strong showing
to land. However, this county will
have a' good chance to get the work
next year.
W. T. Maakstad, of Randall, who
graduates from Ames college this
spring, will be one of the men who
will help make this farm survey.
Knute Espe, of Jewell, who gradu
ated from Ames a year ago, is also
connected with this work, having
been engaged last summer in the soil
survey work which was done in four
other counties of the state last year.
