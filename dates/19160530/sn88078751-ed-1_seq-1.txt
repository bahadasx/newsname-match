"Washington, May 29. Carranza'a
latest note to the United States, de
manding a withdrawal of the Amerl
can forces from northern Mexico, will
reach Washington some time today.
The Mexican embassy was advised

Mexican foreign office, is nearing
Washington. As soon as possible
after the noto is received and trans
lated, it will be presented to Secre
tary of State Lansing by Eliseo Ar
redondo, the Mexican ambassador
designate.
A protest was received at tho White
House reporting serious difficulties
between American oil operators at
Tamptco and tho Mexican authorities.
Tho protest came in tho form of a
telegram addressed to President Wil
son by eighty-four citizens residing
at Tampico, who had held a mass
meeting and determined to lay their
case before the government. They
declared that Mexican military offi
cials Were promulgating decrees de
signed to make1 it impossible for
Americans to do business in the coun
try, and told how one of their number
had been arrested because he refused
to pay his employes wages fixed by
the authorities in excess of terms pre
viously agreed upon with the men.
The signers of the message assert
ed their right to protection from the
American government, and announc
ed their determination not to comply
with arbitrary and confiscatory orders
and decrees by the Mexicans.

HARDING'S KEYNOTE SPEECH
. A PLEA FOR PEACE
Washington, May 29. Senator
Harding's keynote address, at the Re
publican national convention will be
an oration in behalf of peace. It will
he a plea for a complete reunion and
future co-ordination of tho elements
of the Republican party that have
been in discord. In it ho voices in
tho most appealing way the desire of
politicians of all shades of opinion
that the old bitterness shall not bo
carried into this year's campaign and
offers the most cordial invitation for
the return of those Progressives who
left tho reservation In 1912.
A vigorous program of prepared

CARRANZA TROOPS
REPLACE AMERICANS
Explanation of Movement of
Soldiers into Chihuahua.
El Paso, Tex., May 29. Major
George T. Langhorne and his two
troops of the Eighth cavalry returned
here from their chase after Glenn
Springs bandits into Mexico. They
left Fort Eliss three weeks ago, fol
lowing receipt of news of the raid by
Mexican bandits on Boqulllas and
Glenn Springs, and while away chased
the bandits more than 125 miles into
Mexico, rescued Jesse Deemer, an
American citizen, and two of his em
ployes, killed two bandits and cap
tured four others, two of whom were
wounded. Major Langhorne and his
men were relieved of duty in tho "Big
Bend" region by the Sixth cavalry,
which reached there a week ago.
General Funston considered the mil
itary situation such as to warrant the
relief of Major Langhorne's command,
so that it might return to EI Paso at
this time, when Carranza's troops In
such large numbers are being concen
trated south of Juarez and to the east
and west of the border town opposite
El Paso.
The Carranza explanation of the
movement of 10,000 Carranza troops
Into the state of Chihuahua is that
they are to "replace" the American
troops now occupying a portion of tha
Mexican state under command of Gen
eral Pershing, although the American
forces have not signified their inten
tion as yet of giving up their places
to the Carranza troops.
Officials of the war department are
awaiting with interest the outcome of
the conference arranged between
Brigadier General Pershing and Gen
eral Gavira, Carranza's military com
mander In northern Chihuahua, which
will consider proposals for closer mil
itary co-oreratlon between the Amer
ican and Mexican forces In pursuit of
the bandits. General Funston report
ed to the war department that he had
been advised by General Pershing
that the conferences would begin at
Casas Grandes on Wednesday or
Thursday.

DRIVE ON SALOfiICA LAUHGHEQ
Movement Believed to Have Been In
stigated by Bulgaria's Ally, Ger
many, to Forestall Any Possible Al
lied Campaign In Macedonia Oper
ations On the French and Itallrrc
Battle Fronts.
London, May 29. The crossing or
the Greek frontier by the Bulgarian
Macedonian army and the occupation,
by It of four Greek forts, coupled with
the report that the Bulgarians are ad
vancing in the direction of Kavalrf,
are interpreted here as foreshadow
ing a Bulgarian drive on Salonica.
Such a drive is believed here to bo
Instigated by Bulgaria's ally, Ger
many, with the view of forestalling
any possible allied campaign in Mace
donia, and thus depriving the entente
powers of the initiative, repeating tho
performances at Verdun and on the
Trentino.
The Bulgarians are reported to have
occupied the Greek forts of Rupel,
Dragotln, Spatovo and Kanivo.
For months there has existed a
complete deadlock on the Greek fron
tier. The failure of the Teutons
'after the overrunning of Serbia, to -
push through to Salonica before tbat
Greek port was converted Into a pow
erful fortress, now serving as the
base of an equally powerful allied
army, has frequently been reported
to be based on disagreements between.
Germany's allies, Austria, Turkey and"
Bulgaria, over the prospective spoils
of such a campaign. These disagree
ments, it is believed here, have been
settled and Bulgaria has been select
ed to play the leading part, If possi
ble, alone, in the drive against the
Greek port, with the view or dislodg
ing or even destroying the Anglo
French-Serbian army.
The Bulgarian invasion has talien
place with the consent of the Greek
government In giving this consent
and explaining It to the diplomats at
Athens. King Constantine's govern
ment stated that no other course was.
left open to Greece after she ha
made similar concessions to the en
tente powers in the past.
It is stated that the Greeks fought
the Bulgars at Rupoll for two and
one-half hours before the order from
Athens to evacuate the fort was re-
ceived.
FURTHER GAINS MADE "
Austrians Still On the Offensive or
the Italian Front.
London. May 29. The Austria
war office announces further gains In
the drive through the southern Ty
rolean front against Arslero, As.Igo
nnd Vicenza. Another fortification of'
Arsiero has'been captured. They also
announce the taking of a barrier work
in the Assa valley, southwest of
MonteInterotto.
The Italians admit that the Aus
trian pressure in tne region to the
east of the Assa valley continues to
be strong, but tell of repulsing at
tacks at other parta of the threatened
line. According to the Italian com
mand, the Austrians are increasing
the frequency of their attacks in the
Lagrina valley.
On the French Front.
Paris, May 29 The day was de
voted by the Germans before Verdun
to violent artillery bombardments
throughout the region of Le More
Homme, on the west bank of tho
Meuse, and the sector west of yie
Thlaumont farm, on the east bank.
The Germans took the offensive In
Alence, making two attempts at an.
attack northeast of Balschweller. a.
town northwest of Altklsch. They
were unable to leave their trenchea
under the French fire.
