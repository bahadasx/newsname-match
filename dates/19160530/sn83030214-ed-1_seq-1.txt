Eighl policemen were swanprng ex?
perienee.. in the squad room of the
Fifth streel station a' noon yes!erday
when a sergeant stepped in and an?
nounced that the Hfa of Fatroiman
Henry H Schwarz depended upon an
immediate blood transfusion. Light
policemen arose without further com?
ment and offered blood from their oivn
vein? to save the life of their eomrade.
"Young Schwarz was shot with his
own gun this morning while trying to
save somebody down in a basement on
First Avenue," the sergeant explained.
"Remember, it was onlv the other day
that he said he hoped to be in the
Honor Legion bv next vear.''
Honor Man Offers Blood.
Alexander Knittel. himself a two
star Legion man and a veteran in the
.-fitron, drew the sergeant aside and
said Me was anxious to go to Bellevue
and submit to the knife. Ytt, he ad
mittol. he was or.e of ihe older men,
but why should a younger man always
),.. txpeeted to make the saerifices.
Why : houldn't hc !
The rem-ining seven men wrre ad
vancinc to make their arguments when
?hr s?rgeant ir.terrupted them ar.d told
tha' he would accept the offer
and that of Policeman Denni? B.cklev,
a giar.t rookie.
It was not until . o'clock Ifl rhe
afternoon tha! rhe cal! came. Ba
sprang ro hil feel and started for the
squadroom door. Bu' the veteran d.. ew
him back and preceded him to the hos?
pital. The operation was quickly per?
formed and, according to n?*? thn'
crime from the hoapital last night,
K ttol'l sarrirlce will restore the in?
jured policeman to his wife and chil?

Schwarz was passing 106 Fir-t Ave
true, when hia attontion was atrracted
bv tha di-charge Bf revolvcrs in the
basement. Followed by Fatroiman J.
P. Healy. the policeman ru-he,) into
the darkness and, with drawn revolver,
ordered the three men ha could !
scareely see to throw up their hands.
They complied, Mcminfly dmppir.g
their weapons
"Now go cal! the wagnn," he aaid
to Healy.
Healy was away but a few mo
ments. The time was long enough to
permit the three occupants of the cel?
lar to fire several shots into the body
of the policeman, however, and escape.
Fight for Life at Hospital.
At Hellevue it was feared at fVrst
that Schwarz could not recover. Then
it was decided that immediate blood
transfusion would save him.
Later in the day Vito Pltzo, part'
owner of the storage cellar, was found '
leekiflg treatment for a bullet wound \
in the head. He was locked up inl1
spite of his protestn of innocence. li*
denied that his brother-in-law, Tony '

Prussian Decree Frees
Provisions from Rural
Districts.
Berlin. May 99. Feeding the masses
' of the population in the larger citiesby
! means of central kitchens under mu
' nicipal auspiees is the solution selected
' by the government to meet the probiem
of the food supply and distribution dur
, ing the period of the war.
The president of the food regulation
board. Adolph von Batocki. announced
I to the Ways and Means Committee of
the Reiehstag to-day that an appro?
priation bill for funds to assist the
i enunicipalities to organize and operate
the kitchens would be irnrnediately sub
] mitted to the Reiehstag
The municipality of Schneneberg, the
j seeond largest Berlin suburb, has al?
ready arranged to feed 10,400 persons
f in such inatitutiona. A aimilar organi
tation for Berlin was called into life at
a conference to-day, whieh was notable
for *he pre??nee of two women, Frau
Hedwig Heyle and Fraulein Landsberg,
among the members of the conference.
Th<< Pmaaiail government has issued
a decree tending to end one of the
most serious causes or tho scarcity of
meat in the larger cities namely, the
growmg tondeney of tho local authori
tlei in the country districts to pro
hibil rh? exnor' of provisions from
these districts.
The decree, whieh is addressed to
the provincial presiden'., derlarrs tha*
such nrohihition must not be rolerated,
save m exceptional cases, ttd points
out that the special powers, granted
at an earlier date, were intended to
equalize the conditions of living, and
not to give preference to the producing
districts. It is added that under the
war conditions no class of people can
claim the right to live on an ante
bellum scale.
The decree eontirms reports brought
to Berlin by travellers, who uniformly
expreBI surprise at the abundance and
cheapness of food in the country dis?
tricts.
Herr von Batocki, ln the committee,
declared himself optimistic with re?
gard to the crop prospects and the
outlook of additional sustenance for
the people. a declaration whieh is sup
I orted by the highlr favorable reports
from all the districts of the empire.
100-YEAR TREE SAVES

old locust tree stand," the fa'hor of
F. F. Davis used to tell him. "Som^
day the lightning will rome and in?
stead of hitting the barns will strike
the tree."
Heeding the advice, Davis s'ead
fastly refused to chop down the free,
although $100 was reeently offered
him by a man who wanted a pole.
It was a gigannc locus', more than
one hundred feet high. with not a
branch less than forty feet from tba
ground. For one hundred years it had
stood, a landmark on the Davis farm.
Yesterday there was a rwn-hour
storm. with just one lightning bolt. It
?track the tree and felled it. Splin-]
ters were scattered over five acrea.
The rarns were unhurt.

[From Ttre Tr-lhrir.. R ..? a .
Washington, May 29.?The Democratic platform wiD
contain a plank favoring a league of nations for permanent
peace. following the suggestions of President Wilson's
speech of Saturday night, aceording to intimations in well
informed quarters here to-day. It is said President V'ilson
already has begun work on thp platform. He probably will
draft all of its cssential features.
That the President intends to continue advocating
peace negotiations until something is accomplished toward
bringing the belligerents together is practically stttled.
Peace is to be pushed to the front as a chief campaign issue.
Following the custom which forbid.s Presidents to cam?
paign for re-elcction, he will make no politieal speeche.' thifi
summer. Such speeches as he may make in response to
invitations will revohe largely about the international sit?
uation.

I have been able to get any considera

publication, whieh shows that condi?

understood that the general sentiment

Richard Lambert. represen'arivo of a

feeling is growing rapidly, but not
peace at any price. What we want is
such a peace aa will guarantee no re

Sir John Barlow, a Quaker, said:
"I entirely sympathize with President
Wilson, in his desire for peace of
the world. This probably will come,
in my opinion. by negotiation, whieh
in time must supplant wars."

BRITISH PRESS
FINDS A PUZZLE
Fails to Understand How
Wilson Reaches His
Point of View.
B> FRED B. PITNFY.
'P. Ctt'.e ro Th? T~
Paris. May 29.?President Wil?
son'? peace proposals made before
the I.eague to Knforce Peace are not
taken very ferioujly here. at it is
generally eonsidercd that his speech
wa? bound up with the apprra.hing
Presidential campaign.
"President Wilson put himself in
Iir.e with his audience," said the
"Journal," "and filled his speech with
illusions of a new worid where
wolves are changed to sheep. In
truth the position of the President
is embarrassing and dominated by
consideration of the electoral cam?
paign in whieh, while he is assured
of the Democratic nomination, he will
not nece.ssarily have Bryan's radica!
paeifist group with him, while, also,
he finds in front of him the pro-Ger
mans and at tho same time the inter
vention party pushing him from be?
hind. Wilson must try to put him?
self in the centre ar.d draw members
of all parties to him. Therefore he
tries the inoffensive part of invent
ir.g chimeras for the future"
Clemenceau's "I.'Homme Fr.chaine"
says: "Wilson is trying the old game
or" pleasing bo'h the All iei ar.d Ger?
many. The first part of hil speech ia
direeted against Germany, arhick vio
lated the sovereigr.'y of Be_giu_a, and
the seeond part against Fngland, be?
cause Germany has not free use of the
seas."
The "Figaro" says: "He beg'ns with
the enormity of deelaring that tha
causes of the war are no longer impor?
tant, but he talked to paciflatt, and
therefore returned to dreams whrch
rremed renounced when he .?. parated
from Rrvan and whrch ?eem necessary
again in view of the approaching elec?
tions Without going i-.to d.tails of
the harm done bv the war to Ameriea,
it seems to ui that the mo?( h.rm ?*
.'one bv Germany's sibmarrne warfare.
and Wilson reemed to share that view
v-hen he sent an ultimatum to tiermanv
after the Suss-x affair. If the Kaiser
has not yet broken ?h? forma! prom?
ises he made in responae to that ulti?
matum, that is not suffleient reason
for adopting ideas whieh rhe power
laaanaaa of his fleet has hred 'n him "
The "Journal des Debats" says:
' Sometimes President Wilson' is al?
most insolent in the tone of hts ulti?
matum* to Germany; sometimes he has
jearched for eoncilictory Ianguage;
sometimes he poses tn a champion of
hurnanity and er-- ll . aad some?
times he divides : ? . v be
iween barbnnans and eiviliied people.
Laal week he invr'ed all the warring
nations without d'stinction to seek h'
.onnse!, and finally before the Peace
I.eague he Iaid down a plan for uni
.erfal peace.
"The grrv ?< Briti h.s pro?
posals is thaf I'ermanv and Austria
.ave 4hown by this war that they w'M
IO. be bound by trootioa, ard yti Wil
? on is silent in far- of 'h.;r acts.
S'ow he findi his tongue again, but it
-apper.n to be at a time when an elee
oral campaign is about to begin. One
r.ar b? pardoned if skeptical."
