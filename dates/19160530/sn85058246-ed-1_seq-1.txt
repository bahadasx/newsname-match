DEATH BUT ADDS
A LUSTER TO A

The drums still thunder and tho
fifes sound clear;
Tho tattered Hags wave splondldly
on ;igh.
You say: Tho ranks grow thinner
year by year.
And miss n greybcnul with a steam
ing eye.
You watch them march, and bless
each hallowed head,
And wish that one wore there whom
you might namo;
Why, conirado, don't glvo way. Tho
ho bo dead
Death adds a luster to nbravu man's
famo.
A tlmo there wns when you and ho
were young;
Twos long ago, my friend, wo must
allow,
You think of hand clasps, of ho
songs he sung,
And so you miss tho volca nil ullcut
now.
Perliapu you both were suitors for a
hand,
Of ono who loved, and vanished like
a flamo. ,
There, comrndo, don't glvo way. Just
understand
Death adds a luster to a bravo man's
fame.
You miss the man who proved to
true and brave,
Whllu fighting that n nation might
bo freo;
But think of this: Thoro never was
a gravo
Could hold tlio spirit. In Uod's tuo-
dom, he,
Afar from earthly caro, beyond all
blamo,
Comrado, your friend shall lovo you
. all the moro
Death adds a luBter to a bravo man's
fame.
In years to corao, In story and In
song,
Eyes shall grow moist abovo our sol
diers' deeds;
Oh, noblo ho to whom his country's
wrong
Becomes his own, although his own
huart bleeds!
Oh, noblo lie who In thoso darker
days,
Conceived but cowardice tho only
shume;
Who fearless, trod tho fateful bloody
ways
Death adds a luster to a brave man's
famo.
Your friend was bravo, was noblo;
o'en ns these,
Whoso shuffling limbs onco leaped. to
danger's throno;
Who laughed at hellish war's dlscor-
dances,
And fought to honor's credit nnd
their own.
Come, comrndo, cheer themr Cheor
