"feet at M o'clock tonight. J Ed
Crumbauch a graduate of the Univer- !
sity who for the last seven ears has
been Dean of the School of Janitors,
has been appointed to succeed Doctor
Hill
Though this announcement comes
as a thunderbolt out of a clear sky to
Mi-oiiri studtnts, it can by no means
be accounted a hasty or mi-taken ac
tion. I)r Hill has been considering
this step ever since he was appointed
in Vis. he admitted when interviewed
yesterday He long has realized that
Mr t rumlMUgh was qualified to dis
charge tli duties of the po-t, and
this uik pertel climax to his con
victions came merely as the culmina
tion of serious study and reflection.
Having the gcod of Missouri students
always at heart and being forced,
through the mints of .Mr Crumbaugh.
he resigmd in favor of the latter.
Mr Crumbaugh was interviewed to
obtain an idea of his intentions and
nt hie nmninn of Dr. Hill's action. I
Brandishing his cane alternately over
each shoulder of the reporter and
shifting his cigar from one side of hs
mouth to the other, he delineated the
true condition of affairs.
"You see. when Dr. Jesse resigned
I was expecting to be appointed to
fill the chair Hut the Board of Cu
rators had no clear-sighted men at
that time The chose A. Ross Hill,
then Dean in Cornell University. You
understand? Well, next ear came the
offer of this position which I now
hold, and I accepted it, merely as a
temporary makeshift. But always
have I had mv eye on the presidency
and ever was expecting the appoint
ment knowing as I did, that Dr. Hill
was a discerning man who eventually
would bow- to the might of superior
ability
And I have been trying to
fit mvself for the iost. I even had an
old chair used by a former president,
moved io mv oillce so that I could be
come accustomed to 'Sitting in it. You
see don't vou' I therefore vvas not
!, surprised at this step of A. Ross Hih,
L unexpected as it vvas to University stu-
dents."
Mr fmmlmnli i? nmnhntip vitfWS
concerning the policv he will follow.
Ha expresses himself as unequivo-1
cally in favor of all hazing of fresh
men "spare the rod and spoil the
child." h- savs The student-alumni i
union is abhorrent to him and he will
go all in his power to defeat it, "even
if joung Loziir has to be expelled."
Negative r-ciit he considers a relrc
of barbarism he will permit students
'o stav in the University as long as
they wish no matter how much neg
ative credit thev have. Four years of
military training will be required.
This idea of having an advisor for
women is foolishness and needless
' ettravaganr.' Hereafter, Universi

President Hill was in his otlice late
last night when a Yellow Extra repor-
ter called on him. "Yes, I hae quit.'
answered the doctor, when the repor-
ter asked him about his resignation.
Doctor Crumbaugh, who will take
Doctor Hill's place, is a ropular and
competent member of the faculty and
and is equally as well known as an

HOT TAMALE. Met., May 3. The
report that Villa has been captured

It is thought that the plans were
sold to the German government by
Prof. C G. Ross of the Journalism
faculty and Miss Margaret Murphy,
one of the 101C graduates, who is ex
pected to sail, with the Rosses, for Aus
tralia ne.xt week. The Australian trip
was merely a ruse to enable them to
get safely out of the country. A war
rant for their arrest will be issued on
a charge of high treason.
Though the authorities have suspect
ed some one vvas in communication
with the enemy, the most skillful de
tectives would never have determined
the truth had not Miss Murphy's
strong Irish sentiments lead them to
connect her with the case. She had
frequently been heard to praise the
Germans and discuss in glowing terms
the close feeling of friendship exist
ing between the Irish and the Ger
mans. said Governor Elliott W. Major today
in a speech in the Democratic National
Convention in Convention Hall declin
ing the nomination for the presidency.
When the chairman of the conven
tion rapped for order at five minutes
past ten o'clock this morning and an
nounced, "Nominations for President
of the United States are now- in order,"
all the delegates leaped to their feet

with true heroism I decided not to i

found in the pocket of the -lain man.
At the first the immense audience
did not realize that it was in the pres
ence of death. But before the cur
tain reached the Hoor, all were on
their feet and frt nzied men and women
trampled one another under foot in
their effort to reach the door. Strong
men uttered hoarse gutteral cries and
women fainted. The latter were crush
ed to death beneath thousands of feet.
Great heaps of dead pik-J up around
the exits, crushed, bleeding and
mangled beyond recognition. The
number of dead is not known but will
mount into the hundreds.
Woman, The Uuusf.
The theory advanced for the bloody
murder is that the two men have for
.several vears been suitors to the same
I girl. La-t week after Madderson made
a trip to Kansas City suposedly on
business, Boster met him and the two
men quarreled.
j The matter was dropped until a few
minutes before the Yellow Peril play
ended this morning. Instea'J of using
a blank catridge to shoot Bo:ter who
was playing the city editor role, Mad
derson inserted a loaded cartridge
with the above fatal results.
A picture of the woman who was
the cause of the shcoting was found

is not known.
