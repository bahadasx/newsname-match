May Be Idiot
The Waimea district court is
puzzled over just what to do with
a Filipino held under arrest there
since last Saturday on the general
charge of insanity. It has develop
ed that the man may be in the
class designated as idiots, and
harmless, and if that is conclusive
ly shown he will probably be re
leased. Scenery For Tiptop
A contract has been closed with
Harry R.Marcelle. the scenic artist
who is now at Honolulu, to paint
the beautiful scenic designs for the
new Tiptop theater in Lihue. He
will begin work very shortly. The
scenery for the new theater will
be quite elaborate.
Republicans To Meet
Meetings of Republican voters
will be held in all of the precincts
at 7: 30 Thursday evening for the
purpose of nominating officers of
the clubs and delegates to the
Territorial convention. These
officers will be elected a week lat
er, as per party rules.

FILIPINO
DROWNS
IN RESERVOIR
A Filipino named Marian Chim
al, aged 24, was drowned about
noon Sunday while bathing in the
Kamalama reservoir at the Kapaa
side of Kealia plantation.
The victim of the accident and
two other young men went to the
reservoir to swim. One entered
the water with Chitnal, the other
tarrying on shore. On a sudden
Chimal took cramps and sank. His
companion made an unavailing ef
fort to save him,
The dead man was an employee
of the Makee Sugar Company.
A coroner's jury empanelled on
the case returned a verdict of ac
cidental drowning.
NARROW ESCAPE
Three lapanese belonging to Li
hue mill camp undoubtedly owe
their lives to the timely assistance
rendered them by head luna A.
Theilen, when last week the form
er attempted to fish off the rocks
near one of the sand beaches lo
cated along the marine drive.
Mr. Theilen and family were
enjoying a quiet picnic near the
shore when it was observed that
the Japanese in question seemed
to be in distress, apparently en
deavoring to fieht against a strong
undertow, although it was evi
dent that none could swim. A
wave caught up one of tha dis
tressed Nipponese, dashing him
against a rock, and causing him to
lose consciousness and go under.
Mr. Theilen threw out some lum
ber to the remaining struggling
fishermen, and together they suc
ceeded in dragging the limp form
of the unconscious partner ashore.
After working over the apparently
lifeless body for some time, suc
cess rewarded the first aid work
ers and the man was able to be
taken to Lihue where the wound
received on the head from impact
with the rock was dressed.
Wants Kauai Documents
The following: is from the Ho
nolulu Star-Bulletin:
Robert C. Lydecker, librarian at
the public archives, will visit both
Maui and Kauai within the next
few weeks to gather on those is
lands the old court records that
have been preserved in the different
circuits.
Recently Mr. Lvdecker visited
Hawaii on a similar trip and has
been busy for the last few weeks
arranging his findings in the new
racks at the archives building. He
has not set the exact date for his
trip, nor decided on which island
to visit first.

TENNIS PLAYERS
TO PLAY "ACTING"
Elaborate plans are under wav
for what promists to be the crown
ing event of the season, in the
wnv of entertainment by local
talent.
Tennis on Kauai will be given a
strong stimulus by a number of
enthusiasts, whose efforts are bent
toward putting before the public
an evening's program, designed to
eclipse any further attempts by
Kauai amateurs for the benefit of
that popular sport.
The main feature, it is learned,
is to consist of a two act farce en
titled "Mr. Bob." Characteriza
tion features of a high order, as
well as roles of wide latitude,
make this a farce not usually at
tempted outside of the professional
stage, but it is confidently assert
ed that a caste well able to do full
justice to this piece, has been se
lected.
Friday June 16th has been se
lected as the date on which this
performance will be given at the
Lihue Hall. Other features con
sisting of musical items and fancy
dancing will round out a solid
evening's enjo ment with dancing
to follow.
Numbered reserved seats are on
sale at Hofgaard's Store, Waimea,
and also at the Lihue Store.
Two In One
The first battalion, Fourth In
fantry, needed a scaling wall for
maneuvers in Lihue and also
wanted a new backstop for the
baseball field. Major Rice con
ceived the idea of building the
scaling wall where the backstop
ought to be, so he now has both
in one structure.
Officers Coming
General Samuel I. Johnson and
Colonel Chas. S. Lincoln will

the date of their arrival here being
