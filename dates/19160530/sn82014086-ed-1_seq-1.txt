THE BOYS
The road grows short as our line grows thin
On the maroh to the final night,
And the evening fills the valleys in
With a mingled shade and light. '
Close up the ranks till our shoulders meet,
Though no more with a steady poise,
We follow now the war drum's beat
Aa we did when we were boys.
Draw nearer now to the oampfire's glow (
Let ua see one another plain
Before the firelog burns so low
Aa to ne'er blaze up again. -
Some good things pass, and some endure;
There are some that eld time destroys;
But naught outlives the friendship pure
That we knew when wo were boys.
For boys aee far, though their minds be filled
WUh the dreams that may have an end.
Then hope are high, then- hearts are thrilled
When the eye beholds a friend.
Then faith is deep, and it can't be bought
Like a spendthrift's useless toys.
The bravest men that ever fought
For this land of ours were boys. '
1
That boyhood faith. may this day renew.
Till it rivet a friendship chain
To hold us close and keep us true
While the' last .two boys remain.
And all the way we'll be loyal still,
Be there sorrows ahead or joys,
True comrades up or down life's hill,
As we were when we were boys.

REPUBUCAN ROOSEVELT '
HEADQUARTERS IN CHICAGO

Lawrence Graham of New York.
Chicago, May 29. Republican Roose
velt headquarters were opened in Chi
cago today by Herbert L. Satterlee and
Lawrence Graham of New York and
active work of getting delegate votes
for the candidate . began. The head
quarters were opened hours before
Colonel Roosevelt arrived here on his
wav to Kansas City, where he is to
delier an address tomorrow.
George L. Von Meyer, former secre
tary of the navy, is expected In Chi
cago tomorrow to assume charge of
the pre-convention campaign for
Roosevelt.
Indications are that the plan of
Frank H. Hitchcock to have the name
of Charles E. Hughes presented to the
republican national convention as the
first candidate may result in an In
teresting fight between the Root,
Roosevelt and Hughes forces. Hitch
cock's arrangement is that when the
I roll of states is called in alphabetical
order to make nominations for presi
dent, to have Alabama, the first on
the list, yield in favor of New York, so
that HugheB may have the advantage
of having his name presented first
When friends of Root and Roosecelt
learned of this plan they declared they
would attempt to get recognition from
the chairman to present the name of
their candidate before that of Justice
Hughes. They said the chairman
would be obliged to settle the dispute
at tho time It arises.

"It is a Bitv that the whole bbuna

Fight Not Yet Ended.
'The people are awakeninsr to the
fact that votes are cast in congress
very largely in order that reciprocity
