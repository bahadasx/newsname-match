Is Heartiest Reception
Given City's Guest.
Ever I
Kansas City, May 30. Kansas City
gave Colonel Theodore Roosevelt a
renl western reception Jnday. From
the moment his train oreezed into the
union station until he arose in Con
vention hail to fulfill his part as the
city's Mei.-orial dav orator, the colonel'-
time -was taken up by cere
monies arranged in his honor. Before
noon he had delivered two short ad
dressesone to a. group of ch ldren
who erected him in the lobby of his
hotel ard The other from the hotel
balcony to hundreds grouped in .the
street. In both tilks the colonel con
tinued to preach of preparedness and
to w:rn his listeners to be ready to
protect the country by arms, if nec
essary. A great crowd greeted the
former president in union station
plaza. Police officers had to force
their way through and once the chair
man "f the reception committee. Ma
jor William Warner, was separated
from the guest of honor. Colonel
Rrosevelt pushed ahead without his
escort to the waiting motor car. One
thousand Buy Scouts stood at attention i
as the colonel's car rolled by.
Waves Hat to I Joy Scouts.
"Great, great," the former presi
dent shouted, waving his hat at the !
youngsters. I
One hundred motor cars were In '
line in the parade to Colonel Koose-
velt's hotel. Before the former presi- :
dent's car marched 100 members of I
the American Legation and Veterans :
of Foreign wars. Behind it came the
naval militia and seventy-five ex-navy '
and army men. i
As the guest of honor rode through
the lane of holiday crowds he stood
in his car, bowing repeatedly and
talking incessantly to the people.
When his car passed the yellow dec
orated motor cars parked along the
way bearing banners marked "Votes
for Women" Colonel Koosevelt waved
his hat and shouted: "Hurrah, Hur
rah." Colonel Roosevelt received his first
surprise upon his arrival at Hotel
Muehlebach. As he mounted the steps
to the lobby he was greeted by one
hundred little girls ranging from four
to ten years dressed in costumes re
sembling draped flags. When the
colonel came into view the children
began to sing "America, I Love You."
Mr. Roosevelt stopped, apparently
much impressed by the reception.
"1 would have been glad to have
come all the way to Kansas City just
for this reception," the colonel said to
the children. Placing his hands upon
the shoulders of Major Warner and
Col. John B. Stone, a Confederate vet
eran. Colonel Roosevelt said "I stand
today by the side of a man who wore
the blue in the civil war and a man
who wore the gray. But now we're
Americans and nothing else.
"On the way to the hotel I have been
greeted by veterans of the civil war
and by my com-ades of the smaller
war but it was the only war there
was. The Spanish-American conflict
was accompanied by some bloodshed.
But we were fortunate for we had ! een
preparing our navy lor six or eight
years before it began. If we had not
been prepared there wotld have been
a war all right, but it would have been
ten or twelve years longer before it
ended.
"So, on this day of all others. I wa.nt
to appeal to the great west for pa
triotism. I want to appeal to men I
know will stand right if the appeal to
help our country is made to them in

Held This Afternoon.
Indianapolis. Tnd.. May 30. More
than a score of the fastest racing cars
in America lined up today for the sixth
annual running of the International

tance of less than 500 miles, this year's
contest being for only 300. The prize

Eight Thousand Members of G.

In twelve months the thin blue-grey

From the ranks of 15,000 veterans
who wore the blue and the grey, nearly
1,500 have been taken away since the
last salute and the decoration of the
little green tents.
Estimates by C. A. Meek, depart
ment commander of Kansas, indicate
that probably S00 men have been lost
in the year from the ranks of 8.000
members of the G. A. R. In this state.
There were approximately 15.000 old
soldiers in the state on last Decora
tion day. Estimating a loss among
non-members similar to that among
those in the G. A. R.. it is probable
that 1,500, or ten per cent of the -otal
number of veterans in the state, have
passed to their reward during the year.
125 a Month.
Under the estimates from the of
fices of the department commander,
it is probable that during the last year
the death rate among old soldiers in
Kansas has averaged 125 a month or
a little more than four deaths a day. j
No detailed figures are available, but
from reports from Grand Army camps j
and informations supplied from vari- i
ous sources. It is believed that the I
year's death loss has equalled ten per
cent.
"It is impossible to make an accu
rate statement of the number of !
deaths during the year." said G. W
Brassfield. assistant department com- i
mander. "Our reports show the loss
from camps of from 700 to 800 mem
bers from a membership of 8,000.
Some of the camps have not reported

COL. MOSBY DEAD
Famons Confederate Leader 111
for Long Time.
Death Occurred on Memorial
Day at Washington.
Washington. May 30. Col. John S.
Mosby, the most famous Confederate
raider of the Civil war, died here to
day after a long illness. He was a
native of Virginia and was 82 years
old.
Colonel Mosby, the sponsor of "Moe
bys Men" and one of the last of the
dashing figures of the Civil war, was
admired both by north and south
although he had many enemies in
both sections.
He was the originator of the Mosby
method of warfare; to use only picked
men and to make each man seem a
hundred. So dangerous was he to the
north that he was declared an outlaw
and denied the right of surrender at
the end of the war.
Cavalrymen searched for Mosby in
the Virginia mountains until General
Grant, appealed to by Moeby's wife,
ordered the outlawry order cancelled
Colonel Mosby started life peace
ably enough at the Mosby plantation
at Edgemont, Powhattan countv, Va.,
where he was born in 1833. He was
graduated from the University of Vir
ginia a full fledged lawyer at nine

TOPEKANS, A CALL TO ARMS!
Just a little confidential chat with Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer,
Mr. and Mrs. Suburbanite, Mr. and Mrs. Jones-Pays-the-Freight
: Please don't get the idea that this auditorium bond
proposition will saddle your tax roll and don't listen to these
fellows who tell you that a new auditorium is of benefit only
to the Kansas avenue merchants. Remember this one all im
portant point all that helps Topeka, helps YOU. If Topeka
grows, if conventions make Topeka their home, if Kansans
come to this city you will receive due benefit. Every step
forward on the part of Topeka increases the value of your
property, cements your position, increases your employment
opportunities. Let's not be selfish, citizens of Topeka. When
you vote at the bond election tomorrow, remember that the
tax for the new auditorium will "be only 10 cents on $1,000
valuation. If you are so fortunate as to own property in
Topeka, it is your duty to aid in Topeka's growth, in her stand
ing among the cities of the west and in her advancement and
prosperity. Your property will gain by the effort. If you
don't own property vote for the bonds as a matter of patriot
ism and loyalty. Do your bit in standing' up for the city you
call home. The State Journal wants you to know as a friend,
as a reader, as a fellow Topekan, that a new auditorium is
needed and needed badly. Honestly, Topekans, the entire
matter is right up to us now. Let's go to bat like lively,
progressive, boosting good fellows. ' Kansas is looking to
see if the capital city really intends, to furnish a basis for her
claim as the "convention city of the west.' A3 individuals,
it will cost little from a financial standpoint. We will be well
repaid in pride and patriotism. What's your answer?

"Military Preparedness Against
War" His Text for West.
Colonel Roosevelt's speech
at Kansas City in full on page
6 of the State Journal today.
Kansas City. Mo., "May 30 "Mili
tary preparedness against war" was
today urged upon the nation by Colo
nel Theodore Roosevelt. Pointing out
that this nation was wealthy, weak
and no longer isolated, the former
president declared it possible that
after the European war close some
nation, coveting American riches or
territory, would force a fight over the
Monroe doctrine.
To maintain peace he urged a navy,
ranking second in the world, with a
regular army of 250,000 men, these
forces to be backed by the nation, pre.
pared by universal training and serv
ice. By adopting universal service. T.
R. explained the nation would get a
democratic army. "Such an army
would be a people's army." he said,
"and it would never be used except
in a people's war.
As an example of preparedness h
held up Switzerland, stating that
Switzerland was at peace now because
she was prepared and only because
she was prepared. "Preparedness in
stead of being provocative of war and
injustice, tells in favor of peace and
justice for ourselves," he added.
Denounces AdministratloiL.
Industrial preparedness as well aa
military was urged.
Roosevelt denounced ' the adminis
tration foreign policy, claiming failure
to prepare for instant insistance on
American rights when the European
struggle broke out, had cost thousands
of lives of noncombatants.
He Insisted that the kind of neu
trality which consista of tame accep
tance of injury from all sides had ths
effect of earning for this nation the
contempt of all belligerents and
brought it to the verge of trouble
with them.
Weakness Invites Contempt. .
"Weakness invites contempt,
Roosevelt said. "Weakness combined
with bluster invites both contempt
and aggression."
Characterizing the pacifists as
"false prophets." the colonel warned
against "both the prophets of sordid
materialism, and the prophets of that
silly sentimentalism which refuses to
look truths in the face if the truths
8re unpleasant." The professional
pacificist he classed as "merely the
tool of the sensual materialist who has
no ideals. whose, shrivelled soul is
