Night was Successful
Affair
The High School Junior Meda!
contest held at the school Auditorium
on last Friday night was a decided
success and all of the contestants ac
quitted themselves with honor. The
Judge had some trouble in deciding
to whom the medals should be given
but finally decided to give Miss flora
Lipscomb the medal for the girls,
and Mr. Paul Jones the medal for
the boys. There was a good crowd
out to hear the boys and girls orate
considering the extreme warm weath

THE REAL CULPRIT
(L-l-r-e)
The Crown Prince had been so
busy that he hadn't had time to get
together with his father and haye a
confidential chat. But one evening
when there was a lull in the 808
centimeter guns', they managed to get
few moments off. . The Crown
Prince turned to his father and said:
'Dad, there is something I have
been wanting to ask you for a long
time. Is Cousin George really re
sponsible for this scrape?"
"No, my son."
"Well, did Cousin Nick have any
thing to do with it?"
"Not at all."
"Possibly you did?"
"No, sir."
"Then would you mind telling me
who it was?"
i he anointed one was silent tor a
moment. Then he turned to his son
and said;
"I'll tell yon how it happened
About two or three years ago there
was a wild man came over here from
the United States, one of those lip
roaring rough riders that you read
about in dime novels, but he certain-
y did have about him a plausible air.
took him out and showed him our
fleet. Then I showed him the army,
and after he had looked them over,
he said to me, 'Bill, you could lick
the world.' And I was damn fool
enough to believe him."

REV, DIIBOSE
Delivers a Splendid Address
at the M. E Church, South
Sunday Night to a Very
Large Audience
Rev. DuBose, who is book editor
of the Methodist Publishing House,
in Nashville, delivered a solendid ad
dress to a large and appreciative auct-s
ience at the M. E. Church, South-,
Sunday night. It was considered, by
many to be the best baccalaureate
sermon ever delivered in thiscity and
although the nizht was exceedinriv
warm and the house crowded, therez
was no evidence of anv unrest or-?
weariness on the part of the audiencae
during the hour and. a half address
It was so interesting that one forgot
the flight of time, forgot the ther
mometer was hoverintr around 90. in
fact forgot everything except the fact
that he was listening to one of the
most scholarily addresses ever deliv
ered in this city.
Gel the Farmer Trade
Why is it that there is so much.
wealth among the farmers and
yet so little of it finds its way
into this town? There is a rea
son, and a potent one. If we
ask our farmer friends they per
haps will tell as. Bat we shlould!
have brains enough to solve this
problem ourselves. We
shouldn't adopt the kinder-gar
ten method of asking some ons
wno knows more than we do
It is up to tbe commercial inter
ests of this town. We can nob
nstly blame the farmer, because
if we were in his place wo would
undoubtedly be doing just as ha
s doing, It is his money and ho
baB a right to do as he pleases
with it, and it is a safe bet that
he will exercise that right to the
imit whenever he spends a
dollar.
It will not be difficult to keep
the farmer trade in this town if
our business men go after it in
the right way. The farmer mast
be convinced by cold facts that
t is to his interest to do all of
lis trading in this town, but it
will take something beside empty
words to do it. He is a man of
facts, and nothing but facta will
ave anywoight with him.
Hence, we repeat, it is our dqty
to get together and remedy the
defects in our commercial system
that now exists and make condi-
tions such that the farmer wilL
tarn to this town instinctively as
the most logical and profitable
place to trade.
