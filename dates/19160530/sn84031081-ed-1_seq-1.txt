Santa Fe. May 29. War a type
writer In the office of Marion &
Wood used for the purpose of writing
the four letters which played so large
and sinister a part in the litigation
over the estate of the late F.llas G.
ilarcia letters purporting to have
lieen written by Garcia himself from ly counsel over a motion by .Mr.
different cities of the country at dlf- i Purkhart in the nature of a lieinur
ferent times, acknowledging the pa- rer to the answer to that portion of
ternity of the child who afterwards the charges alleging the improper use
became a claimant to n share of his of information obtained from Mrs.
estate, estimated at a quarter of a Petra, G. Garcia while Marion and
million dollars? Wood were her attorneys. Mr. Murk.
This was the main question consid- hart claiming that the answer admit
ted today in the trial of the disbar- i led this charge, and that the introduc
ment proceedings against Owen X. j lion of evidence to prove it was un
Marron, state treasurer of Xew Mex- j necessary. Judge l'ope reserved his

,.,iim.u which arc franebt wilh

most prominent attorneys in

I
Mexlro.
This is not the only question in
vnlved in the case, but it is the one
which received the greater portion of
Ihe attention of the court today. The
question of whether the members of
the firm of Marron and Wood should
he disbarred for unprofessional con
duct in using information obtained by
them for the purpose of stirring up i
litigation against their former client,
is yet to he gone into. A thiiil'e,u's- .

In regard to their case, was taken up

The most sensational feature of the
disbarment proceedings Involving the
alleged fabrication of documents by
Marron and Wood, which hi e been
adjudged In the main case to have been
spurious, bids fair to develop int i a
duel between handwriting or, to lie
more exact, typewriting experts, (me
of the must eminent authoiities in the
''nlted States a man who has testi
fied in some of the most famous trials
In the history of the country today
expressed the unqualified opinion that
four typewritten letters which had
hcen adjudged to be spurious weie
wrltten on the same typewriter
m two legal documents which are ad
mitted to have emanatel from the of
fice of Marron and Wood.
Sitting on the opposite side of :he
room from the witness, while he whs
testifying, was another expert, equally
famous, who took notes and consulted
with counsel throughout the hearing.
This expert was armed with speei
"iens of enlarged photographs of
typewriting, and it is expected that
hi" will take the stand tomorrow
rooming and testify with equal pnsi
tiveness that the two sets of docu
ments could not possibly have been
Wtien on the same typewriter.
Thus the court will have its choice
of opinions equally emphatic, from ex
torts equally eminent, directly con
tradicting each other.
Attributes of Typewriters.
The peculiarities of typewriters were
discussed and dissected in the court
today much as a physician
''ould dissect a human body, and
m"ch the same terminology was used
In describing them.
"Congenital defects," "Anatomical
characteristics," and other attributes
which were defined as "symptomatic,"
"Physiological" and "structural," al
most led one to imagine that a clinic
w'is In progress rather than a legal
mvestigation of whether two sets of
documents were written on the same
miiohinp.
The use 0f magnifying glasses and
j,nHy adjusted protractors and scales
'r measuring the height, width and
alKles of letters in the disputed docu
Mfi, to the smallest fraction of an
in'h, also lent an odd touch to the
Wneopding, and more than once the
raking of evidence was halted In or
to give the judge an opportunity

a dispatch covering the operations of
the lirltlsh army In thai territory from
December 1! last, when he took over
the command, until May 19, pays high
praise to the French defense at Ver
dun and reviews In detail the action In
which the lirltlsh have taken part.
"During this period," he says, "ihe
only offensive effort made by the
enemy on a greut scale wuh directed
ngalnst our French allies near Verdun.
The fighting In that area has been
prolonged and severe. The results
have been worthy of the traditions of
the French army and of great service
. to the cause of the allies.
I Illicitly Ihssi-s llcmy.
j "The efforts made by the enemy
j have caused him heavy losses, both In
j men and In prestige, and he has made
j these sacrifices without gaining any
j advantage: to counter balance them,
j "During this snuggle my troops
have been in readiness to co-opi'liite
'as Ihey might be needed, but the only
'assistance- asked for hy our nllles was
of an Indirect nature, namely, the
relief of the French troops on u por

enemy, was u somewhat delicate oper
ation, but It was carried out with
complete success, thanks to the cor
dial co-operation and good-will of nil
, ranks concerned and to the luck of
J enterprise shown by the enemy during
relief."
Krllish St"iiggle Continuous,
While no action comparable with
that at Verdun has been fought on
the llrlllsh front, (leneral Haig says
the Hritlsh struggle has been continu
ous and that there have been many
sharp local actions. The maintenance
and repair of the trenches alone

tailed constant and heavy work,
speaks of the continual activity

sappers uud miners, and adds:
"Evcr-presenl threats cause a more
constant strain than any other form
of wurfaie.
Sixty Lim-iiI Actions,
There were sixty local actions dur
Ing the period under review, some of
which, says General Haig, "although
Individually Insignificant In a war on
such an Immense scale, would have
l been considered worthy of a separate
i dlspa,tc:h under different conditions."
j The Hritlsh commander makes spe-
clal mention of raids or "cutting nut
parties," which have been made nt I
least two or three times a week
against tho enemy lines. I
hcscrihi'H "Cultlng Out Parties." 1
! "They consist," he says, "of a brief;
attack, with some special object, on a
section of the opposing t rem lies, and
urn usually carried out at night by a !
small body of men. The character of j
these operations, the preparation of
the road through our own and the
enemy's wires, the crossing of open
ground, the unseen penetration of tho
.enemy's trenches, halid-lo-hiind fight-j
tug in the darkness, and the uncer
tainty as lo the strength of the op
