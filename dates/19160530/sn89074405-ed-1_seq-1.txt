HOWMOIil
QUIT HIS WORK
Big Financial Affairs Bear
Marks of Master
Hand.
St. Paul. May 80.—For several years
James J. Hill has been in the habit
of Insisting, both to his friends and
to the public, that he was not ao
tively engaged in. business.
Just how active he was during the
-last two years of hie life can "be
.judged only by little evidences of his
master hand in matters affecting the
Great Northern railroad and the First
National bank of 8t. Paul, and by
three outatandlng accomplishments
in which his will snd genius ssssrted
themselves.
From a world viewpoint-it would be
hard to aay whether his stanch sup
port of ths Belgian people, following
the invasion by the Germans, or the
part played in the negotiations for
the $500,000,000 losn to the allied
governments is the more impoitsnt.
From a local viewpoint his influsnce
in the upbuilding of South St. Paul
Stock yards, prlndpslly through the
decision of Armour & Co. to come to
that suburb claims first rank.
Aided the Belgians.
From the time the work of succor
ing ths Belgians began Mr. Hill took
a leading part in the movement It
will probably never be known, how
much money he sent to King Albert,
an old personal friend, and how much
he induced others to send.
His place aa an international figure
never was more prominently displayed
than when the representatives of the
allies came to New Tork in quest of a
huge loan. One of the first men to be
sent for by J. P. Morgan was Mr. HIU,
and his assurance that he and the
people of the northwest were prepared
to do their share In taking up the for
eign bonds Is believed to have con
tributed largely to the success of the
negotiations.
