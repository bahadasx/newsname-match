Stuart H. Carroll.
Dawn! and on the green kept graves.
Where heroes sleep from bygone years,
The drops that yestermorn were devv
Have turned todav to tears.
Noon! the sunbeams drifting down
In slender threads of golden light.
Descend on "little tents of green",
And fashion halos bright.
Night! and through the shadowed sky.
Where souls of martyred soldiers dwell,
Each diamond we called a star
Is now a sentinel.

ised speech in "behalf of the naval

much lower after the war.

Kitchin's speech and the house then
began consideration of the bill un
der the rule permitting five minute
speeches on ame-ndments. This
probably will be continued until 4
o'clock Friday afternoon, the hour
?et for the tinal vote. The; house
remained in session until late this
evening, and the leaders agreed to
meet tomorrow at the usual hour
instead of recessing over Memorial
day.

ten of Illinois and Koberts of Massa
chusetts spoke during the day for
the minority report with its larger
building program, including two
dreadnaughts and six battle cruisers
instead of live battle cruisers pro
vided for in the bill. Mr. Farr drew
applause from the galleries by de
claring In favor of building 2 5 cap
ital fighting ships, 230 submarines
