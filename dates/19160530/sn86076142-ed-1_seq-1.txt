PORTLAND, May .10. Charles
Sweeny, a millionaire miner, died to
day. He was heavily Interested In
Portland and Spokane real estate.
His home was at Spokane. At the
close of the civil war he came to
California and later was with the
Comstock and Belcher mines at Vir
ginia City. After he was Injured In
I he Belcher fire he gave up mining.
The deceased never gave any atten
tion to the Tonopah rush which began
while he was In this state. Sweeny al
ways coutended that the discovery
would soon die out and that the Bilver
mines of the southern country would
prove nothing more than surface de
posits. One day In February, 1002, Mr.
Sweeny met a bunch of Tonopah men
In the Waldorf and renewed his as
sertion that Tonopah could not make
good. There were a few Tonopah
millionaires at that time, but It ao
happened that the crowd Included
""me good boosters from Nevada one
of whom shook a bank roll under
Sweeny's nose and defied. him to cover
m.Ooo on. bet that the name of To
nopah would become 'Known around
'he Jtlobe wherever mining was fol
lowed or the value of sliver was dls-
, cussed. The bet was not taken.
Col. Mosby dared death over fifty
years ago when at the head of a band
of a few hundred Confederate raiders
he rode up and down the Shenandoah
Valley, capturing outposts, destroying
supply trains, and cutting oft means
of communication, tl has been est!
mated that he often neutralized the
force of over 15,000 Federals In the
valley.
Horn In Powhattan county, Va.,
December 6, 1833, ana graduated from
the University of Virginia In 1852, he
was practising law In Bristol, Va
when the war broke out and he begun
hi career in the Confederate army
He proved his daring with auch effect
that he became a scout for Uen. 3. K
B. Stuart and led the celebrated raid
around MeClellan's army on the Chlck
nhominy. In Richmond a year later
he recruited an Independent cavalry
troop which became famous as Mos
by'B Partisan Rangers. They became
night riders and the terror of. the
Federal troops.
Mosby's most brilliant exploit was
the capture of Gen. Stoughton. On a
March night in 1863 he, with 30 fol
lowers, rode through the Federal army
to Fairfax court house, only 15 miles
from Washington, where Gen. Stough
ton was asleep. Although surround
ed by an army said to have been 17,000
strong, the rangers calmly kidnapped
the general, his staff and many sen
tries, and turned them over to the
Confederate authorities at Culpeper
without having lost a man.
General Grant once later saved Mos
by from hanging, and the two foes
of the battlefield became staunch
friends. Mosby stumped the state of
Virginia or Grant and was rewarded
with an appointment as consul at
Hong Kong. When he returned to the
United States, Mosby called on the
surviving members of his rangers and
to his astonishment, fie found that a
large percentage of niem had become

Magnitude of Halifax Vein
Disclosed by Examination
Halifax was synonymous with
Hades until a few months ago, but now
that air connection has been made,
the workings are as comfortable as
may be desired. This respiratory pro
cess is partly natural, due to the Hali
fax upcasting and the Buckeye down
casting! but the process Is aided and
abetted by the use of fanB, some of
them bringing air from the surface,
others exhausting the used atmos
phere from the depths.
There is one place, however, when
a man may enjoy the luxury of a
Russian bath and need not tarry long
lor the experience. This is in the
face of the 1,700 level. The rock Is so
hot that a fellow feels tempted to
plunge his hand into the water after
of making the miners comfortable
and safe. There was a time when a
dollar a ton wag offered for mucking,
but nobody wanted the job, now the
trammers make the round trip in com
parative comfort, finding cooling sta
tions along the way as well as at the
terminal of the trip.
What Is of Bupreme Importance at
this time Is not the Tungs, but the
veins of the mine. In almost the exact
geographical center of the group of
four claims comprising the Halifax,
making a block 1,200 from north to
south and 3,000 fee on the trend or
the vein system, there is a huge bed
of trachyte, the mother, formation of
the district and embedded in this has
been found a vein that seems to be
touching the wall, but the water, he is forty feet in width, at least the Btopers
warned, is just hot enougn to cook, a I are extracting everything for the ore
tenderfoot, but not of sufficiently high! binB across that distance, It must
temperature to boil an egg. The lat
ter statement is talsen with a grain
of salt.
Wonders have undeniably been
wrought in the Halifax in the matter
be noted, however, that it Is a very
flat vein, something like 23 degrees
from the horizontal, consequently a
tape put on the hangmg and run at
right angles to the foot, would not
be paid out more than twenty feet.
But just imagine twenty feet of
pay! That is what the Halifax la
showing at present. The rein trend
nearly east and west and dips to the
north. A drift haa already been ex
tended a distance of 160 feet and the
face is still in ore or quality similar
to that in the stope.
This vein was encountered aeveral
months ago on the 12th level. A winze
was sent down 141 feet and here 'the
ore body was founa to be so wide
and so profitable that the company
immediately began stoplng and this
intermediate has proven so vast a
proposition that It will be a long time
before any pressing need Will arise to
open the vein on anotner level. Tet
time is being taken by the forelock
and the 1,300 intermediates level is
now an accomplished fact. Likewise
the raise from the fourteenth level,
which has direct connection with the
shaft, has been made and crosscuts .
