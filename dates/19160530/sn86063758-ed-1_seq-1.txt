KIIXJE SPBI>G SCHOOL
UltMSHES PLEASANT EVEMXG
It was my good fortune to attend
the school plays at the Ridge Spring
school in township No. 7 Thursday
evening May :'6. That these exercises j
were of a high'.v; entertaining char- j
acter goes without saying; they were]
. ot only elaborate, but uplifting,!
evincing careful and painstaking
preparation upon the part of the
teachers, as well as studious memorizing
d. d acting by the participants.
These plays or charades furbished
' freriuine amusement and delight to
the fine community comprising the
school district, all of which was
shared by those of us from the cutside.
who were fortunately invited
to be present
And this leads me to remark, that
onv- riivtrfpt i n this SOOd COUn
ty, ;vl*er?: tiie community spirit is inI
tense and loyal, could as easily conI
tribute to a like pleasure, which of
itself awakens newness of life, and
a gpr?LTous rivalry among the youn?
P' >1: with consequences of value
n* irr proveme.U that it would be
u c to estimate.
It uiay be well to make mention, ol
the care and service of Miss Jean-,
nette Simpson, the principal, of Mi38
Lorie Smith, assistant and teacher of
^the primary department, and also of
IMiss McDanieL -who has been inpartf
\
ing music instruction. Without intending
to make invidious comparison,
I stall venture to say that the
Coloaial Minuet was of abounding
interest, . and aroused within us a
lively appreciation of the graceful'
movements, and figures, which in polite
society are regarded essentials
to recognition and approval. And as
I watched I fancied there were some
George and Martha tWashingtons in
embyro, so to speak, as time and
opportunity may disclose. '
The school is heartily supported
by such excellent people as tie Fellers,
Sanders, Werts, Pitts, De
Loachs, Dominicks, and others whose
names I do not recall.
At the conclusion of the plays, Mr.
Howell Fellers, master of ceremonies,
introduced County Superintendent of
Education Chas. P. Barre, Esq., and
Col. Elbert H. J ull, in the order named,
who spoke generally upon the
suljecv of education, payicg a just
eulogium "upon patrons and teachers
| alike for the splendid showing dur1
ing the scholastic term just closing.
The addresses were forceful and comprehensive
and were received with
hearty applause.
The subject of education and how
best to arouse the highest interest
and support, is always met with responsive
appreciation, as so oa this
?? T o fina im TifOC
occasion. I ucuc nay a. uut. nu^tvu
sion will prevail and let me add, may
-it lead up to even longer school periods,
and enlarged school facilities
and buildings. j
(Not the least enjoyable to me was !
the hearty welcome extended to me j
and the kind hospitality of Mr. and |
Mrs. Henry Fellers. I k congratulate i
the school district for the inspiration j
and success of the evening.

The battle of Verdun continues unah?fed.
On hoth sides of the Meuse

their unprecedented bombardments

French are replying to the German
guns virtually shot for shot, and under
a "withering fire holding the Germans
at almost every point.
One more gain, however, has been
made by the Germans. After recapturing

they penetrated the French lines. I
Around Douaumont a heavy artillery
duel is in progress and northwest

their artillery activity against

TO COURTMARTIAL
TEXAS GUARDSKEJf
Baker Points Out That Under Present
Status Men Are Bonnd to
Respond Promptly.
Washington, May 23.?One hundred
ana sixteen Texas- mjuiuamen wno
failed to respond to the call for service
on the Mexican border will bd
courtmartialed byorde r of President
Wilson. They will be subject to fines
or imprisonment, as the court may
direct, with the approval of the president.
Secretary Baker announced today
that the guardsmen would be tried
promptly und?r the Dick law, reversing
a previous decision to deiay*action
in order to deal with the cases
under the new Hay-Chamberlain
army reorganization bill. The presinent
himself will appoint the court
martial and Maj. Gen. Funston has
been instructed to recommend its
memfbers, a majority of whom must
be officers of the Texas National
Guard.
So far no steps have been taken toward
prosecuting New Mexico and
Arizona guardsmen wfco like the Texans
have failed to "present themselves
for muster." An additional report
from Gen. Funsfcojx regarding
them is awaited. ^
Baker Explains It -V ~
Secretary Baker tonight issued tha^ssg- ^
following statement, explaining the
action of the department: "v
"The Dick bill,provides ,as An offailure
an^4to&*>art of tho
t VWftLfc. iiA' a AW*4
cue matraaiu w. imoscui,
themselves for muster..when .called
upon by the -president ta do so. One
hundred acd sixteen members 'of ths
T?xas National Guard are reported
to ha*fc failed so to present themselves,
tinder the Dick bdl! they
would be guilty of failure to present
themselves for muster;"When
the pending legislation is
approved a^d the miiiti^jaf tl*3 State*
is reorganized and ^^fiAfiied 'twere- J
nnder, th* obligation-of the, enlisted
man of the National wil-l be to
preserve the constitutions ' of the
United States and their respective
States and obey the lawful orders of
the president and the governors of
their respective States. Thereafter
when the president issues a call to
the National Gaurd the call will of its
own force muster each member o?
the Natiopa! Ouard i.:to the federal
service and it will no longer be neccis^ry
for tbe men to ^present' themselves
for muster. ?
\ot Same Offense.
' The offense denounced by the Dick *
bill, therefore, will be impossible, as
it will not be required that the men
should 'present' themselves for muster.
The Dick bill not being repealed
expressly remains in force. The 116
? ""nirlJrvn IiQUO tatpn an Oath.
U1CU 111 VJU^dlUU UUIV IA4HVU ?
to preserve the constitution of the
United States and to obey the lawf?il
orders of the governor of Texas and
not having yet taken an oath to obey
the president as commander-in-chief
must still present themselves for
muster. They are capable, therefore,
of committing the offense in the Dick
bill and are therefore liable to punishment.
"I have decided to have the courtmartial
assembled by command of the
president and have asked Gen. Pun
ston to recommend the members
thereof. While I shall not prescribe,
I shall be inclined to recommend that
the proceedings be abated in cases
where the men are wilting to take the
oath."
