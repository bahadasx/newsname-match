Tomorrow Is the day fixed by the
board of education for the special elec
tion at which the question of voting
an additional levy of one mill for the
support of the public schools will be
submitted to the voters of the Chicka
sha district.
The maximum levy allowed by law
for the maintenance of the schools is
five mills. Calculations made by the
board show that the amount of revenue
thus derived will not be sufficient to
conduct a nine months' term of school
and hence authority for the excise
board to make an additional levy is
asked.
The board has announced that no
more of the extra levy Bought will bo
used than is actually needed to main
tain the schools for a full term. The
amount ask&l for is precisely the
same as was voted a year ago. In
I'm gone. You'll have to shoot;" that

city hall and turned west on Chicka

prisoners at tho head of the stairs

made his break for liberty; that both
Baird and Looney had trailed Kelley
and Crisp all Sunday night and were
watching them Monday night; that
they were watching them when the
Itogus phone call took them to South
Shepherd; that Bajrd threw his night
stick at Crisp and struck him in the
back with it as he broke from him and

BOOZE IS
SEIZED BY
SHERIFF
Sheriff Bailey, accompanied by Dep
uties Castlemau and Mucker, swooped
down on the II. C. Bondurant ham
burger stand on Chickasha avenue
last evening about " o'clock and seia
ed two quarts of whiskey and the
glasses used, the officers allege, in the
marketing of the booze.
Later the officers visited a suppos
ed, restaurant on "Two" street. This
restaurant was not transacting an ac
tive business but. under the auspices
of a woman who was lu charge, it is
alleged a Hue of drinks was being
served from an improvised bar in the
rol" ' ""''''
rear of the
hash end of the place. After the offi
cers had taken In charge the bottle of
booze from which the customers were
being served, the woman proceed
ed to bawl out the customers to tho
queen's' taste, accusing them of being
stool pigeons who had led the officers
to her place.
County Attorney Venable stated this
morning that he thought he would file
information in the first case this af
ternoon. GOLFERS GOING
IN THIRD BOUT
The golf teams which played two
tournaments under the leadership if
"Stopper" Witherspoon and G. Black-
burne, started thefr third engagement
yesterday afternoon with two matches
Other games were played today and
the contestants will finish tomorrow
in time to enjoy the big "feed" which
Is the losers' treat Thursday night.
The wives of the players will be in
vited to the dinner and there will be
places reserved for members who did
not "play if the roiumittee in charge
is notified lu time,
crease In school population has made
a corresponding increase in the
amount necessary to operate the
schools and unless the extra levy is
voted the school - term will be cut
short next year.
In view of the fact that th voters
by a large majority approved the same
request when it was made by the
board last year, it Is not expected
that there will be any pronounced op
position to the proposition this year.
Realizing, however, that it would be
a calamity to Chickasha if for any rea
son there should be a "slip up"
through the failure of a sufficient
number of citizens to vote, it Is
strongly urged that every voter in the
city tuke tho trouble to go to the polls
and go on record in favor of a full
term and aduquate support for tho
schools. Don't forget it bo sure to
vote.

ROOSEVELT
SPEAKS AT
RAN. CITY
Makes Plea for Preparedness in Memorial
Day Address and Pays Tribute to
Veterans Who Fought for
Country
By United Press.
Kansas City, Mo., May 30. Making
a plea for preparedness and paying
tribute to the soldier dead of the na
tion, Col. Theodore Roosevelt deliv
ered a Memorial Day address here
this afternoon. After dwelling at
length upon his well-known arguments
for natiouul defense, he concluded In
part as follows:
"Now, friends, the men here today
whom I have particularly addressed,
the 'men who wore the Blue, and the
men who wore the Gray in the Civil
war, proved that they had convictions
worth dying for. They thereby made
riils a land worth living in. They
showed that they were willing to sac
rifice everything, including life itself,
for certain great ideals. They thereby
ranged themselves among the great
peonies of mankind. No nation is
rcallv great, no race is entitled to at
permanent position of leadership or
of equality on this earth, unless its
sons are willing to die, at need for
great ideals. Rut it is equally impor
tant that they shall show a like pow
er of fealty to ideals in the way they
live their ordinary lives. If after the
lose of the Civil war the soldiers who
fought in it on both sides had shown
themselves so demoralized by the
four years of fighting that they con Id
not settle down to civil life, but in
sisted on continuing in arms and
plunging the country into anarchy,
the" net re'.'lt of their former heroism
would have been destruction for this
nation.
"Such result would have proved
that, although we could produce sol
diers, we could not produce citizens
and the soldier who is u bud citizen,
and the bad citizen who cannot, at
need, serve as a soldier are equally
unfit to live in a free, self-governing
commonwealth.
"This is Memorial Day. You have
today decorated' the graves of gallant
men who paid by their death for the
lack of wisdom and foresight shown
by their forefathers. This is a day
of homage to heroism. But it is also
a day of mourning. For forty years
prior to the Civil war our people re
fused to face facts and soberly bend ,
their energies to make war impossi
ble. Heroes shed their blood, and wo
men walked all their lives in tho shad
ow, because there had been such lack
of foresight, such slothful lazy optim
ism. Let the lesson thus taught sink
into the minds of us of this genera
tion. Let us not from laziness and
lack of foresight create a situation
where bravo nieu shall die to msi.r-
good our short-sightedness. I ask that
wo prepare, not because I wish war,
but because with all my heart I desire
to keep war afar from us; and only
by forethought and by pieparation of
soul and body can we thus keep it
afar off.
"The end we have in view is a high
and fine national life based on an in
dustrial efficiency which shall be ac
companied by social and economic
justice. M-i-li-t-a-r-y preparedness
against war is merely a means to this
emj. But it is an indispensable
means. We are not fit to be free men
i unless we show the toretUou.Ut and
mi.
m
will power' necessary to insure, tluit
we ourselves shall have the right to
decide our own destinies, und not be
forced helplessly to submit to have
them decided by alien conquerors."
In addition to discussing prepared
ness, Roosevelt covered a wide range
of topics in his address which is re
garded as the keynote of his cam
paign. Ho touched upon the tariff
and attacked the administration for
alleged failure to enforce treaties and
mitigate the honors of war. Infer
entially, he dubbed Henry Ford us a
"sensual materialist whose shriveled
soul is wholly absorbed by automobiles
and movies."

By United Press.
Washington, May 30. Colonel Johnj
S. Mosby, famous Confederate cavalry,
leader, died at tho Garfield hospital
hero today. Ho wus S3 years of afcti.
He had been llslnce Sunday.
Colonel Mosby, the sponsor of "Mos
bv's Men" and one of the last of tba
dashing figures of the Civil war, w
admired by both north and south e
though ho had jnany enemies ia both)
sections.
He was the originator of the Mosby
method of warfare; to use only picked
men and tto make each man seem a!
hundred. So dangerous was he to tbs
north that he was declared an outlaw
and denied the Tight of surrender at
the eud of the war. ,
Cavalrymen searched for" Mosby in
the Virginia mountains until General
Grant, appealed to by Mosby'u wife,
ordered the outlawry order cancelled.
Colonel Mosby started Ufa peacea
bly enough at the Mosby plantation at
Edgomont, Powhattan county, Va.
where he was born in 1833. He was
graduated from the University of Vir.
ginia a full fledged lawyer at nine
teen In 1852.
Three years spent at hts parents'
home palled on him, and be started
the practice -of law in 1S55. Soon,
thereafter he ruaiTled Miss Paulina
Clarke, daughter of Judga Beverly J.
Clarke, who had served as a member
cf congress and U. S. minister to Gaut
emala.
When the Confederacy called for;
troops, Mosby enlisted with Gen. J. B
B. Stuart's First Virginia cavalry. In
Stuart and Mosby, the regiment fur
nished the south two of its famous of
ficers. Stuart, then colonel, becamo cavalry
leader for the south, and it was to him
that Mosby outlined the plan bo bait
conceived for Mosby's Men.
In the winter of 1862-1863 Iha plarf
was completed and launched. Mosby
given a roving commission, circled tw
the rear of General Burnside, facing:
that of Lee along the Rappahannock:
river. His raid there was the first C
many that took the heart out of th
Union men who felt the sting of Ll3
little band of wasp-like cavalrymen.
It was Mosby's plan to hit quick and
hard always from behind. When hw
was cut off from all help with hostile
! troops between him and his people.
He was captured once and wouffded
several times. When be was captur
ed he was taken to Washington. It
was a matter of regret for the north,
that he was soon exchanged and sent
back to his army.
After the war and after .General
Grant, by his magnanimous ordtr, had
the order of outlawry against him lift,
ed Mosby started to practice- law ia
Warrenton. Va. He startled tho south,
when in 1X72 lie voted for Grant
hated Republican for president. .
Virginians could not understand that
motives of Colonel Mosby. Ostraciz
ed, ho left Warreufon and went to)
Washington. He practiced law until
ho was made consul to Hongkong. On
his return in lsfi5. he was put on tba
legal staff of the Southern Pacific. Inf
San Francisco. He resigned and took
a place In the general land office In
vestigating land frauds.
In 1905 he entered the DeBartmen!
of Justice as special attorney. He was
removed as 'senile" bjj Attorney Gen
eral Wickershiim in 1910. Coincident,
with his removal, he published a booli
on the cavalry maneuvers of the bat
tlo of Gettysburg that seemed so far
irom "senile that it was adopted ttn
a text book by the war college.
