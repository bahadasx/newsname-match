believe in this because I think it would be not onlv of incalculable
benefit to the nation in the event
to the individuals undergoing it, and, therefore, to the nation as a
whole as regards the work of peace. The military tent, where all

give them a knowledge of sanitation,
regularity of habits, abstinence, obedience self-respect and respect for
otners. iney would learn to handle and command men, and to get
along with them. They would become infinitely more competent fot
the daily tasks of American life. I have not hesitated, and do not now
hesitate, to condemn Germany where Germany's action have been
wrong, but it is folly to blink the fact that in many respects Germany
furnishes us an example we shall do well to heed, for she secures her
people good government, orderly government, and substantial economic
justice combined with high industrial efficiency.
Universal Service and Social Welfare.
Our National Government in return for universal service should
take an interest in the health and vigor of its citizens. Such conditions
as the lack even of statistics on births, deaths and health in two-thirds of

Conflicting Rumors as to Wheth
er Jurist Will Accept, Makes
Situation Uncertain.
WILL MAKE NO STATEMENT
Meanwhile, Dark Horse Nominee
Looms Up as Bugaboo for
Candidates.
Widely conflicting reports con
cerning the attitude of Justice
Hughes toward the Republican
Presidential nomination constituted
one of the features of the political
situation today.
AH sorts of rumors are current
both here and in Chicago as to
what course Justice Hughes will
take. N
One story which has circulated
persistently since yesterday after
noon is that Justice Hughes in a
few days will take himself com
pletely out of the Presidential con
test. According to this version, Justice
Hughes has become more or less
displeased over the pulling and
hauling which is going on, and will
declare that under no circum
stances will he accept the nomina
tion. WOULD UPSET PLANS.
Such an announcement ' from Justice
Hnghea would throw the plans of most
of tho political leaders completely into
the air. ' .
If Justice Hughea - ah'ouid eliminate '
htmsMJ it would 'c-dn propabljK-ta
tha' activity ot tho .Roosevelt readers. In
trying to force him to come out lto
the open on the issues ot preparedneaa
and Americanism.
Friends ot Colonel Roosevelt profess
to have no doubt whatever that it Jus
tice Hughes.should step out, the Colonel
would be nominated without dirrtcuity.
On the other hand, some of the favorite
son candidates regard Justice Hughes
aa the chief obstacle in their path.
Still another report la that Justice
Hughes is willing to announce his can
didacy and resign from the bench be
fore the convention meets, provided he
can do assured mere win De no uuu
Moose ticket In the field. This story
has been In circulation more or less in
Chicago,
It Is not taken with much seriousness
In Washington. The prevailing opinion
here aa reflected among politicians ait
the Capitol, la that Justice Hughea is
willing to accept tho nomination If it
goes to him with something llko
unanimity and without a serious flght.
Expect No Statement From Hughes.
Moreover. It la the prevailing belief
that he will have no more statements to
issue for the present and that he sim
ply will remain silent either until tho
convention has acted or until 'develop
ments about the time of the opening ot
tho convention force him to make
some sort ot a statement.
It la known that prominent men who
are friendly to Justice Hughes are hop
ing that he will have nothlcg to say
and have taken pains to let him know
their views. .
1 hat troublesome personage, tho
dark horse. Is lurking about on the out
skirts ot the situation and not a tow
astute politicians believe the nomina
tion ultimately will go In his direction.
Hughes and Roosevelt continue to bo
the foremost figures with respect to
nomination probabilities. The Hughes
elements in Congresa continue to assert
and evidently to believe that he is in
the lead and la scheduled to win.
liut they connot aeny that tho tre
mendous drive the Roosevelt leaders are
making to batter down tho Hughes
strength Is making some Impression.
They admit that Colonel Roosevelt Is
succeeding In stirring up an Increasing
amount of "public sentiment for him.
To the extent that they want to see
Hughes "put out of business" the fa
vorite sons are joining with the Roose
velt forces In trying to stop the Hughes
movement. Some of the favorite sons
In private do not hesitate to admit it Is
uphill work.
"Smoking Out" Hughes.
A large question still unanswered is
whether the Roosevelt and allied op
position to Hughes is Kolntr to make
things so embarrassing to the Justice
as to force him to eliminate himself.
This Is one of the possibilities which
cannot be Ignored, That efforts to
"amoke out" Hughes will continue with
Increasing force up to the time of the
nomination la to be anticipated.
Rooaevelt men believe that If Hughes
drops out or la eliminated It will be
eaay for tho Colonel. 8ome of the fa
vorite sons profess to believe that it
the Colonel kills off the Hughea boom
he will make hla own nomination out of
the question, and there will be nothing
left hut one of the favorite aons or a
dark horss. is I
