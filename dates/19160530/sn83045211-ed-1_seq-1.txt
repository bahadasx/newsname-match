PHILADELPHIA B.VSEBALL PAP.K,
May 30. Philadelphia is tKo homo of busted
and shattered records.' Ted Meredith started
It at Cambridge last Saturday, when he
walloped a couple of old stand-bys on tho
nose, and our Phils kept up tho good work
this morning by putting a crimp in Mr.
McGraw's uspiratlons.
The crimp was a 5 to 1 victory over tho
Qlants and a perfectly good winning streak
Was smashed to smithereens. The visitors
had won 17 straight games In a row and
Were out to mako a now recordr
Just as a matter of history, let It bo
remembered that anothet- winning streak
was wrecked In this 'same city, some four
years ngo. TVashlngton had nnnexed 17
straight wins on .tho road,' oritjVcamo here
.to play the Athletics.- 'The MncHmen did
L,-arwell asrthoy-'icould uritll the" ninth Inning
when I3aker busted ono 6ft the noso and the
stuff was off. " ,
The irarrio this mornlnK was replote with'
excitement, thrills and everything .els .that'
goes to make .up a', good ball game. Both
teams we're ' out to win and speedy ply
resulted. ' , .
AL DESERVED SHUT-OUT.
Al Demaroe was on the 'firing line and his
work was worthy of special mention. He
held the swaVers from the Big Town to
six hits, four of them going to Larry Doyle,
the Well-known captain and second base
man. Our heroes,. on the other hand, nicked
Poll Pcrrltt for seven safeties, four of them
tomlns'ln the fatal eighth stanza. Demaree
deserved a Bhut-out, but a brain-storm In
the ninth upset tho whitewash. Two men
were out' and Benny Kauft was on flrat
Whltted walked away from the, bag to play
the batter, and tho bag was unguarded.
Suddenly Demaree whirled around and
hurled the ball to first. It was a beautiful
peg, cutting the heart of the sack, and It
went" out to right field, penny started
around the bases and registered at the
plate when Cravath recovered the pill.
PEItiUTT TOSSES TO KAUFF.
Burns leaned against a twister and sent
it to left field for a single. Eddie limped
to first and there were shouts for Ted Mere
dith in the grand stand to take his place
on the runways. Ted was not available,
however, "and Ditgey took his place. De
maree sacrificed' and Perrltt leaped Into
the air to stfear tho ball. He got it. rolling
over on hla back and threw 'to Benny
Kauft In centrefleld, instead of Fletcher,
who was waiting at second to receive the
throw.
Dugey went to third and scored when
Bancroft bunted on a squeeze play. Ban
croft reaching first In safety. Niehoft then
walloped a beautiful drive over Kauft's
head for a triple, .scoring Demaree and
Bancroft. Bert was caught between the bags
on the next play, when Stock bunted on an
other attempted squeeze p)ay,
II0MBR FOR CUAVATH.
But the worst Is yet to come. Cravath,
who up to this time had registered but
one measly single, lifted one over the
right field wall, and the last two scores
came In. Claude Cooper, our new left
Welder, made the feature play of the game
In the seventh lining when he speared
Merkla's drive to the left field bleachers
with his gloved hand. It was the greatest
catch ever seen on the homo grounds and,'
it nipped- a batting rally in the, bua.
The ball sailed toward, the two-bit
patrons and It had "home run" written all
over It, Cooler ran back, stepped on a
couple of policemen and backed against the
fence. Turning around, he took one good
look at the flying sphere and lunged slde-
r w5aislwia
It enmc from the bat of Robertson, of the Giants, in the first game today. Umpire Klem is watching the play.

Theodore O'Hara.
The "thin blue line" so many1 thousands
strong that held the Union intact In 1861-66,
decimated by death during the last year to
n. mere handful of Its onco proud strength
today, is dutifully observing Memorial Day,
'the 60 th anniversary of the Grand Army
of the Republic.
Ever slnco the beginning of tho year,
when the 35 posts In this city showed only
2398 members, the death rate among tho
veterans has been unsually high, so that
the decoration of their comrades' graves
must be left for the most part to the
Sons of Veterans and kindred organiza
tions. Loyal to the last, the veterans turned
out so far as they were able, the. gray
haired remnants performing. their labor of
love. But In most cases the present en
rollment of a post, which once claimed Its
members by hundreds, could not muster a
literal "corporal's guard."
But no grave of a fallen soldier went
unadorned and no part of the day's observ
ance In this city was neglected. OnUhe
contrary, today's celebration of Memorial
Day promises to equal in every detail the
proud record of the holiday jn years past.
And not only In this city, but In every
State of the Union excepting Arkansas,
Florida, Louisiana, Oeorsla. Mississippi,

Peace, not grief. Is the dominant note
today. And It Is fitting that peace should
reign, for they whose graves we decorate
and whose memory we honor today died
for peace's sake. They gave their young
lives" for Jt, for us. Their lives were young,
far younger than you or we would imagine,
With the. picture of the gray-haired veterans
In our mind, unconsciously forming a con
cept of gray-haired men in blue charging
cross the battlefield toward a line of gray
halred men in gray. Yea, they were young
sters from Lexington to Vera Cruz when
"iey gave up their Jives.
