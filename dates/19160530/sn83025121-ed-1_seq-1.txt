aad freely express the hope thi-y hold
that the war speadly may nme to an

inclined to believe that the time ia
not come, ' '. ' .-
' Tba British papers apparently are
ready to recognize the force of the

hands of Blr F.dward Gray lost week."
Tha paper adds that the speech of
President Wilson aad the sentiment he
expresses undoubtedly will revive dis
cussion in certain quarter.
Continuing the" Post argues that the
"Allies are-fighting' for the same ob
ject that which Mr. Wilson proposes"

.The, Manchester Guardian, another
extremely. Influential paper, says that
"the blnavof the President rs a old

In Spain and other neutral European

REMARKABLE CAREER
OF EMPIRE BUILDER
James Jerome Hill discovered "the
breadbasket of the world" ia the Great
Northwest j he led in its development
from a wilderness into -what now com
priMes six wealthy atates dotted "with
400,000 farms; apd he biased a trail
for transportation which reached event
ually from. Buffalo to Asia, with a tolul
mileage of rail and steamship facilities
that would nearly girdle the earth.
That but roughly spans the story of his
achievement.
In Kockwood, near Guelph, ia Onta
rio, where llil wasNhora in 1838, the
son of an. Irish-Canadian farmer - who
died when the boy was fifteen there
stands a tree stump labeled) "The last

It marked ft he lad's resolution te go
to the United State. He had been
prompted by an odd incident. Accord-

to fake dinner and left hia borse at the
gate. Young HiU saw. the animal was
tired and he carried it a pail ef water.
The stranger was ploased w ith the lad 'a
thoughtf illness,'. and as he -drove off he
tossed him a . aewapepenv: from the
United Ktates, and nailed out gravely:
"Go there, yoang man. - That coun
try needs youngsters of your spirit."
Starts As Roustabout '?. ' t J ;
HiU read the paper, Carefully. Jt
contained glowing accounts of oppor
tunities in the Htates. - He resolved to
investigate for himself. It waa the neat
morning that he chopped bia last tree.
As a mere roustabout lod of eighteen,
be toured from Malno to Minnesota.
When, in 1X5(1, he disembarked from
a MisHipi river packet at Ht: Paul that
place wns a frontier town of 5000 in
habitants. At the sign of W. J. Bass
k Co., nLrentn for the Dubuane Ht.
Paul Packet Company, he found a job
as both stevedore and dork. ';
In the fifteen years that followed he
seized every opportunity , to study the
whole problem of river tranportation.
He gathered no end of experience and
a little capita! with which he launched
lux unn firm of Hill, Grisa t Co., which
promptly displayed its initiative by
brinnini; the lirst load of eonl that had
ever I n wen in that wet ion into St.
l'uul. 'I'm n yearn later, with a flat bot-toiiii-il
Mtramer he etablished the first

ridgc, both of which terminals were at
at the Nouthern end of the Bed Biver
Valley, and there were about 100 miles
of trnck "which begun- nowhere and
ended in that same Indefinite spot."
This venture ran op a debt -of 3.1,000,
000 and collapsed, with its only assets
being "n few streaks of rust eud u
right of wj-."' .; .
Buys His First Railroad '
Hill had hud sufficient success in the
region to be eeixed With a .consuming
denire to purclinso the defunct prop
erty. After llvo years of financial
dickering, including the bale of all his
other intercHts, which aetted a fortune
of flim.iMio, he and a ayadicate of
others- Hir Donald A. Hmith, George
Htepheu, ami Norman - W. . Kittson,
obtained the object of this desire.
The Ht. l'aul, Minnesota and Mani
toba Railway vess formed to operate
the property, with Hill as general nisu
ngcr. When in 1SS3 Mr. Hill was elect
ed president he undertook the extension
of the rond from its Dakota and Mia

known, did not have a dollar of gov
eminent subsidy or an acre of grant to
forward its progress from the Minne
sota iHiiniiltiry to the sea.
J n this light, Hill's plan was widely
deemed pure folly, but he pressed it to
conclusion by building and populating
as he built. For several years he laid
