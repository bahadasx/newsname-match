Colonel Mosby Dies in a Wash
ington City Hospital at an
Advanced Age.
>R. MBOCtA'tO .????? |
WASHINGTON. May 30.?Colonol
John S. Mosby, the most famous Con-1
federate raider of the C-lvil war. died
here today after a Iodk illness. He
wan a native of Virginia and was1
eighty-two yearn old.
John S. Mosby, the noted Confeder
' ate guerilla chief who never surren I
dored, fought for his life in a
local hospital. Twice before, since
the Civil war. the warrior had routed
death. In Kin" he was thrown from
a carriage In a runaway and his head
1 was injured. He had a lighting
i chance to recover, took it and won.
i In 1012, then 79 years of age, a lin
gering sickness caused editor^ to pre
pare obituaries, which never were
printed. Life hnd been a continuous
1 tight for Mosby who is 82 years of
ago. Every since he shot and wound
ed a fellow student in the University
1 of Virginia for an insult in his youth,
?Mosby had been a companion of
1 deatli. During the Civil war he rode
with death at his heels. After the
war he went to China as consul, and,
I despite throats, cleaned out corrup
! tlon In the service.
Later Mosby entered the lists
! against cattle baronB In Montana
' when they refused to open theii
> ranges for millions of settlers. The
government, fearing for his life,
' warned the colonel to be more care
1 ful In his dealings with men noted
for their straight shooting from the
hip. Mosby laughed and vigorously
prosecuted his work to a finish. Then
he drove grafters from among the
Indians in Oklahoma. In fact he his
been on the filing line all his life in
one section of the country or anol.i
1 er.
Terror to Sheridan and His Men.
I At the beginning of the Civil war,
Mosby enlisted as a private under
General Joseph E. Johnson, and he
maintained a picket^ on the
during the winter of 18C2 and 186 j.
; He was made an adjutant of his regi
inent, but resigned, refusing; hip 'V.nk,
when his colonel was transferred. He
1 served as a scout until July, 180..,
I when he organized a force of irregu
; lar cavalry and carried on a war un
der Ills own direction by harrasslng
: the rear of Sheridan's army In the
I Shenandoah valley.
i Mosby's force at no time numbere.l
1 more than 500 men. It was composed
! of outlaws, desperados and deserters
I from both sides, who acknowledged
I Mosby as leader. Ily sudden attacks
I and raids Mosby and his men broke
lines or communication and at one
' tjme kept 30,000 federal troops busy
trvlng to capture them. When hard
pressed the bandit scattered his force,
only to reunite them at some prear
ranged place later.
Daring and Courageous Chief
There was nothing this cavalry
man was not accused of doing, lie
I wined out isolated pickets, made wild
forays that brought the destruction
of hundreds of provision wagons, and
kept Sheridan's army busy at the
roar while other troopB hammered at
thorn in the front. A price was on
Mosby's head. He hanged five men
from General Custer's command 111
retaliation for the hanging of men,
Custer had caught frim ills forcc. He
rode into the heart of General
SLoughton's army, capturing sentinels
as he went, until he entered the house
where the general was sleeping. Next
morning Stoughton was delivered to
the Confederate authorities.
Mosby never surrendered after Lee
laid down his arms. He continued to
?wear a Confederate coat with uniform
buttons. One day while he was in a
barber shop a fedoral detachment en
tered and demanded that he clip the
buttons. Mosby drew a revolver and
escaped. The buttons continued to
adorn his coat. , j
Neat Exchange with Lincoln.
On one occasion while riding in
Virginia on the banks of the Poto-i
mas river near Washington. Mosby I
took a pair of scissors and clipped a
lock that hung at the waist of a worn-,
and peddling vegetables. Mosby
handed the loclc to the woman with
the direction that sho take it to1 res
ident Lincoln and tell him that. Mosby
would be after a similar keepsake in
a few days.
A month or two later Mosby hap
pened to be passing through the same
section and chanced to meet the same
woman. She handed him an envelope
directed to "Colonel Mosby.' When
he opened the envelope he found a
jock from Lincoln's head and a note
stating that the president did not
wish to cause Mosby the trouble of
entering the White House.

As Shown by a Detailed Story
Explaining the Plan and
Object of Same.
Today's issue of the Telegram con-1
tains a dotallud statement of one of |
the most llboral oilers to Its friends
and patrons thnt has ever been Its
pleasure to nmke during its many
years of existence?the Telegram s
111,000 Club. The object is lo Increase
Its circulation In 10,000 subscribers
ond In order to get those Subscribers,,
we are willing to pay well for the i
work. A list of prizes have been pro
cured and they are on display at the
stores of leading merchants of the city
aud we stand back of every on? of
thera as thoy are all standard make
and must be right.
Heretofore there have Ibeen times
i when opportunities have been given
I the readers of tlio Telegram to par
i tlclpatc 111 the prosperity of the paper
1 hut never before has thore boon offered
I such delightfully appropriate tokens
of appreciation of the Telegram to
! those who become Interested with it
In its plans for progressive action In
the ever Increasing Held of circulation.
The Ideas involved In the 10,000 Club
as outlined In tills Issue are sound and
practical. Sound because thoy are
1 reasonable from every point of viow;
practical because there are no sur
, rounding restrictions or difficulties
, There Is nothing hard or impossible
of accomplishment connected with the
. campaign.
The Plan.
1 The 10,000 Club Is simplicity In It
? self. It costs ynru nothing to enter the
club and compete for the prizes. A
' little of your spare time and a sure
protlt Is yours. The 10,000 Club Is In
' the nature of a "Can't Lose" cora
palgn and you will receive payment
according-to the amount of energy
that you put Into It. You cannot
roll to win somothing of value if you
| interest yourself in all sorioustiess
with the Telegram's plan.
j Should yod not win a prize we stand
i ready to pay yon a twenty per cent
j cash commission on the work that you
1 do.
The hot summer months are coming
and what would be nicer than this big
touring car for a nice spin In the coun
i try especially when it Is a real car, ono
I that you would not be ashamed to take
! anywhere.
The first consideration of most fam
i Illes In connection with buying a car:
| Is the Initial expense entailed which |
! In many cases is quite prohibitory, j
?Realizing this fact and also realizing j
j that it is the dream of every red blood
l cd man and woman to own and drive J
their own car, we have selected this J
magnificent touring car as a free gift j
to the memiber of the 10,000 club that?
secures the highest number of votes j
j during the lite of the campaign. Not j
only these wonderful cars but a long
list of other prizes that are well worth
I anybody's Bpare time.
Illstrlels.
I .. District No. 1 will comprise
| Clarksburg, llroad Oaks, Industrial,
1 Stealey Heights, Tin Plate and North

District uN'o. 2 will comprise all terri
tory outside of UlRtrlct Xo. 1. A sep
arate prlzo llRt has been arranged for
? each district in order to give every
I one a fair chance in each district.
l.lne 1"p.
To enter the club and become a
member, you should fill out and send
j In the nomination coupon which you
will find elsewhere in this Issue. To
enter the club costs you nothing ond
I places you under no obligation what
ever, but if you wish to make certain
1 that you or some of your friends will
I be the gainer by this plan, you should
send In the nomination at once?today.
You gain 5,000 votes by so doing and
I what is more, tho minute you send in
your first subscription you will be en
i titled to thousands of extra votes in
addition. A call at the Telegram offlco
I or a personal letter to the Manager,
Telegram 10,000 Club, ClnrkRlmrg, will
j bring you all the help you need to con
! duct a winning campaign. Receipt
(books and other necessary equipment
will be furnished free.
t\Ticn vour nomination ?'becomes
known you will find all your relatives
and all your friends standing ready to
help In your race. But you must get
them interested before some other club
member reaches them and secures
their support. You could not blame
them if they did not know that you
were Interested.
Turn to the full display announce
ment in this issue and go over
it carefully. Decido for yourself
whether or not you are capable of win
ning as anyone you know. Then act at
once. Nobody has ever reached the
halls of fame or crossed the threshold
of prosperity and happiness without
putting forth a little effort. Standing
back and letting the other fellow have
first choice never secures for you any
of the good tlilngB of life. The bettor
things come only to those who have
the courage and the enthusiasm to go
after them.

CONFIDENT OF VICTORY
Pleads with the Voters to Keep
Petty Prejudices Out of
the Campaign.
Monday night wus a groat night
for Judge IrR E. Robinson, of Graf
ton, cnnillrintc for the Republican
nonilmitlon for govornor.
II wne his drat speaking Invasion
of llnrrlson county and ho wu
Krpi>lf>,| by n crowd wlilch packed the
spacious Hoblnspn Grand theater,
the largest auditorium In the city, to
the doors. Tho gathering reminded
one of tho Colt mooting mooting*
yearn ago.
Judge Robinson made a speech
such a* might he expected from a
statesman or a man of his high char
acter. Thore wan no blunter or bra
gadoclo about him. He merely laid
his claim to the gubernatorial nomi
nation In a cloar and forceful man
ner. That this manner of speaking
pleased his hearors wu midenoed by
the enthusiasm of tho crowd.
The speakqr was Introduced by
Harry n. Ourtln In a few well-choson
words. Mr. Curtln said that ho had
known Judge Hoblnson Intimately
for thlrly.three years, and that there
was nothing In tho Judge's life, either
private or olllclal, to prevent him
from giving his most enthusiastic
support to tho Taylor county candi
date.
The Judge >auncr.o<j into his speooh
; Imedlately, presenting the Issues in
a clear and conclBa manner. Ho
I opened his speech by referring to the
(claims made by Lilly that tho latter
1 would got big majorities from the
southern counties of the state. "I
I have Just come from the southern
part of the state," Bald the Judge,
' and I want to toll you that Mr.
l.llly will not come north of tho
Kanawha river with u majority of
?>ne." The house shook with ap
plause at this statement. Again he
moved his hearors to wild enthusi
asm whon ho declared: "If I can't
bo elected governor without the aid
of n gigantic slush fund, I don't want
to be governor of West Virginia."
Ileplytng to tho Lilly charge* that
he was Clovornor Hatfield's candi
date, and (hat, If elected, he would
be dominated by Hatfleld, Judge
Hoblnson declared that he did not
speak to Governor Hatfleld about po
litical matters uutll two months af
ter he had announced his candidacy.
"I am tho candldato of no faction or
clique. After the fourth day ol next
March Henry D. Hatfleld will not
be governor. I will be. Hatfleld,
Taylor Vinson or no other man will
have a back door key to my ofllee."
Referring to the charge that he
would be dominated by Hatfield, the
speaker declared that he was on the
supreme court bench tor over eight
years and In that time not once were
bin associate Justices, all men for
whom he has the highest regaxd, able
to dominate him.
Judge Hoblnson appealed to the
voters to deliberate carefully before
casting their ballots, and pleadod
with them not to allow petty- preju
dices to Influence their vote. He
characterized Lilly's talk of Hatfleld
lsm mere catch-play to get votes.
The real Issue, he said, was whether
the progress of the state was to be
retarded by a few men.
The epoaker replied to Lilly's cry
of a "payroll brigade" by declaring
that many of tho state employes were
for Lilly. "I have no complaint to
make," ho said. "The employes ot
the state have a light to support
whom they please. Everywhere 1 go
I And paid agents of Vinson, Houston
and McKell boosting Lilly. That'*
another 'payroll brigade.' Mr. IJlly
Is talking about 'new faces'; saying
that he, If elected govornor, he will
discharge all the present state em
ployes. If I am elected governor?
ana I am confident that I will be?I
will not discharge any ot the men
who are supporting Lilly,. I have
made no promises to anyone. I will
Blruply demand efficiency of oU."
Mr. Lilly has charged that Judge
Robinson has no platform. Reply
ing to this, the speaker said: "I
think I have a good platform. It Is
the slmplo codo of truth and nonor
that 1 learned In a plain old farm
house. My platform after June 6
will be that of the Republican party,
which, history has shown, is seldom
erring. My platform after March 4
next will be the constitution of West
Virginia ana tne laws made by the
people." (Referring to Mr. Lilly's
so-called "platform," Judge Kobln
Bon declared that everything Lilly
promises must be given by the legis
lature, ond not by the governor. "I
try to be short on promises and
long on execution," said the Judge.
Lilly's claim that ho should be nomjr
nated because he was born on a farm
was referred to by the Judge, who
said that he, too, was bom on a
farm, but did not consider that tact
a qualification for the governorship
Judge Robinson spoke ot the hardl
ships of the campaign, but said that,
be was glad ho had announced his
candidacy. "And I am going to
win," he added, and the crowd
cheered lustily.
The speaker said that he -was not
In favor of parsimony with respect to
the state government. "Neither am
I in favor of false econmy which
would retard the progress of h??
itate. 1 will demand q fun return
