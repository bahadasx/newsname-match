with a fresh division and Paris ad
mits that i:i the face of this drive
the French were forced to retire
slightly along the Bethincourt-
Cumieres road.
Other Violent Attacks
The German attacks apparently
were equally violent along other sec

but according to the French war of
fice, nowhere else were the Crown
Prince's men able to gain ground.
East of the river heavy artilery lire
in the region of Fort Douaumont is
reported.
Advices from the Balkans show a
continuation of Bulgarian activity
along the Macedonian front, following
the recent occupation by King Ferdi

The Bulgarians are reported to be

Washington Heights Names
Committee to Talk Annexa
tion With Camp Hill
Washington Heights citizens in
town meeting last evening appointed
: Charles H. Bishop, Frank J. Harro
and Gus M. Stelnmetz if committee to
wait on Camp Hill Council at its next
meeting and take up with that body
the matter of annexing Washington
Heights to Camp Hill borough.
The subject of annexation or creat
ing a separate borough for Washing
ton Heights was discussed at length.
Engineer James Thompson showing
by diagram the section proposed to be
included in the tract to be annexed
or incorporated. It was developed
that a twenty mill tax rate for the
proposed borough would yield an in
come of about $5,600 and that this
would not lie sufficient for the pur
poses, especially'since a new school
house would have to be built, about
$750 expended the first year to send
! children to Harrisburg High Schools
(a constantly increasing sum) and
that the expenses of a separate bor
ough would be much greater than if
the territory was simply made a part
of Camp Hill.
It was shown that the proposed
separate borough would cost the tax
payers much more than would be the
case if «he territory were annexed to
! Camp Hill and the two communities
governed by one burgess, one council,
one board of health, one school board,
etc. Besides, annexation to I'amp Hill
would give Washington Heights free
. high school facilities and a graded
school system, which It could not have
| otherwise.
The meeting adjourned to convene
at the call of Chairman Frank J.

"For the spiritual reason there is

any more than fair that she should
