One of the first to leave the house
was John J. Toomey. Mr. Hill's con- 1

L. W. Hill left the house with Rev.
I homas J. Gibbons, vicar-general of
the St. Paul Archdiocese, and George
MnrPherson. intimate friend of the
family. Grief showed plainly on the
face of the elder Hill's su< ?cessor
Mr. Hill died of blood poisoning. I>r.
It James Ollflllan. of St. Paul, the Hill
family physician, announced.
"Mr. Hill has suffered from intes
tinal catarrh and hemorrhoids for a
number of years," said Dr. Gllfillan.
"On May IS he had a chill. It was
followed by a fever, due to infection of
a hemorrhoid.
"The fever passed away next morn
ing. nnd it appeared the trouble was
over. Three days later slight fever)
was present, nnd on May 22 Or Wil- j
Ham J. Mayo saw Mr. Hi 11. At the j
time there was evidence of infection j
of the skin.
"This infection progressed slowly. '
and Fridaig; Dr. William J. Mayo made I
a small i?udsion in the infected area. :
That blffHt Dr. Herman M. an
old frietfd of the family, arrived from
New York, and has been at Mr. Hill's
side constantly.
"Saturday. Doctors William J. and
Charles H. Mayo returned and opened
freely the area of infection. From this !
time on the infection spread down the '
right thigh to below the knee, and Mr. ;
Hill gradually lost strength.
"Game fighter that he was," said Dr. I
GilfUlan later, "he complained hut '
little during his Illness, which was ;
rather painful. He was conscious most j
of the time."
Mr. Hill's last public bequests were
gifts for the advancement of education,
in which he was deeply interested
throughout the latter years of his life.

last nipht as she was returning from
Hollywood Oeme?ery, where she had
placed a wreath of flowers on her
mother's grave.
Lloyd T. Wilson, Jr., with his brother.
Hay Wilson, was driving the machine
back to the home at 2207 Hanover
Avenue, after inking his mother to a
hospital. .Mrs. Wilson has been ill for
some time, and her physicians deemed
it necessary to remand her to tho hos
pital last nlstht. Dr. Wilson remained
at Hie institution with his wife. The
brothers wore within a block of their
home when the accident occurred, and
Miss Payne was within half a block
of her residence.
Police Sergeant Waymaek reached
the scene shortly after the accident, and
was followed by Policemen Heid and
Latham After Ihe death of Miss
Payne, the oflir-ers ntreated young Wil
son on a technical charge of involun
tary manslaughter. He was bailed for
his appearance in Police Court. The i
police said last nipht that their invest!- |
. gat ion showed the accident to have
been unavoidable, and that the arrest
; of Wilson was a formality.

The accident occurred <"ur;ng the
heaviest downpour of the evening, :
Rain was falling in torrents, and per
sons in the neighborhood said that it
was possible to see but a short dis- i
tance. Although many of the arc
iights in the vicinity were out, the
1 one on the corner of Hanover Avenue
i and Rowland Street was burninp. Miss
Payne was struck down a short dis
tance from this light
She had met a friend at Main Street
when she left the street car, and had
i insisted that her companion accompany
her to her home, but the violence of the
storm prevented, and Miss Payne set
I out to go the remainder of the dis
tance alone. She heM her umbrella
close over her head as she. crossed '
Hanover Avenue, and was unable to see
in either direction.
Lloyd Wilson was proceeding toward
his home at a slow rate of speed. His
windshield was up, and. although his
headlights were burning, the downpour
prevented them penetrating the dark
ness for any great, distance. He had
just caupht a glimpse of a dark form
ahead of him and applied his brakes
when o flash of lightning revealed the
presence of the young woman.
MISS PAYNE DEAD
WHEN DOCTOR ARRIVES
Wilson at once applied nts emergency
brake, but Miss Payne, walked directly
into the path of the car. The left head
light and fender struck her, and she
was knocked backward, toward the
center of the street. Wilson stopped
his machine almost instantly and, with
his brother, hurried to her assistance.
In the meantime, J. B. Lipscomb, of
2105 Hanover Avenue, reached them.
He had been sitting at his window
watching the storm and had witnessed
the accident. The three men were
Joined by W. F. Dunkle, of 2104 Han
over Avenue, within a few minutes, and
they carried Miss Payne into Dunkle's
home. One of the Wilson boys sum
moned l">r. Edward McCarthy and the
ambulance, while the others, with Miss
Dunkle. did all possible for Miss Payne.
Evidently she had been injured in
ternally, for blood gushed from her
mouth and nose. No injury was found
on Iter head, and it is thought that all
the force of the Mow she sustained
was centered on her side, and chest.
Dr. McCarthy was the first physician
to reach the house, ami he at once pro
nounced her dead.
I \A VOlDA IILIC ACCIDENT,
DECLARES WITNESS
J. II. Lipscotnb said that, in his opin
ion, the accident was entirely unavoid
able. He declared that he did not see
Miss Payne until she was very close
to the machine, and that the manner
in which Mie carried her umbrella would
have prevented her seeing thw ap
proaching car. Mr. Lipscomb said that
Wilson was driving his machine slowly.
Young Wilson summoned his father
from the hospital as soon as In* ascer
tained that Miss Payne was dead. Dr.
Wilson told of the desperate illness of;
his wife and how the hoys had con-1
veyed her to the hospital. He was'
fearful that site would learn of the'
accident, and said that every precau- i
Hon would be exercised to prevent it
Dr. Wilson added that his son was a
careful driver, and that he was cer-]
tain he was not driving fast when the
accident occurred.
Young Wilson and his brother sua- ;
tained a severe shock as a result of
the accident. Hot'n claimed they were j
driving slowly and carefully. They i
said (hat the windshield was up and
was covered with rain; that the terri
ble downpour prevented them seeing
ahead, and probably accounted for
their failure to see. Miss Payne.

:nteiests of tho country.
Oliver J. Sands, president of the
American National Bank, said yester- j
day. In an interview with The Tlmes
Dlspatch. that Richmond Is, beyond all
question, tho natural center for a land
bank in this district, and ho thought
tl.at Kl eat violence will be done to
the natural trend of business and con
venience if Richmond were omitted. !
Mr. Sands rogurds the hill as another
proof of tho. desire upon the part of '
Ihe administration to leave behind It
a record of constructive legislation.
KARMKItS PAY III (; II Kit
IIATK TIH.X OTIIKRS
.Mr. Sands's explanation of the bill
and of its attendant beneficial results j
to the farmer follows:
"The rural credits bill provides a
| system by which loans can be made
| upon farm property 011 a basis which
1 will give the farmer the opportunity i
of paying his loans out of his earnings,
and is the beginning of what seems in i
me to he a great step toward tho |m
! provcm?nt of the agricultural interests j
'of this countrv.
I
"The Assistant Secretary of the j
Treasury recently made a statement |
[ that over one-third of our people, are
farmers, or are dependent upon them,
and that the farms and improvements
are valued at J40.000.000.0on; that the
annual products are calculated to be i
$8,500,000,000.
"For many reasons, our farmers havo
not been able to borrow money upon
their farms at as low a rate as the
business man has. There is consider- i
able misapprehension, however, in the I
minds of the public on this subject.
; 1 believe that good farmers havo been 1
I able in the past to borrow money :
against their quick assets at a rate j
approximately the same as the busi- 1
ness man in the same territory. When j
I the business man borrows upon his I
property or real estate, he always has
to pay a higher rate than he. Would j
have paid for his commercial require- |
ments; therefore, there has been a good
deal of misconception as to the matter j
Of rate.--; at the same time, anything
that will make it possible for the ''
farmers, or the business man either, to
secure capital with which to carry on !
his business at a lower rate, is bound
to he to his advantage, and in the end
to the advantage of the consuming
public.
HICH MOM) IS CKNTKIt
OK THIS DISTRICT
"The great difficulty in the past has
been that the farmers could not secure
money on their lands with reasonable
assurance that the loans would be car
ried such a time as they could be con
: veniently paid. Therefore, this new !
law provides a system of amortization,,
hy which the principal and interest is
paid in small annual payments. No
loan can be made to any one person for
more than $10,000, and each borrower
must subscribe and pay for stock In
the association equal to 5 per cent of,
his loan and participate in tho profits
of the bank. When he pays his loan.!
however, he surrenders the stock, and
the amount is returned to him.
"Twelve land banks are to be organ
ized. known as the "Federal land banks.''
the capital of which may be subscribed
to by private individuals or by the'
1 nitfcd States government. Those, land j
banks aro to be located throughout the
I'nited States, and it seems to mo that
the same arguments which Induced the
location of the Federal Reserve Hank
of Richmond should influence the loca
tion of one of these land hanks in
Richmond.
"Experience has proven beyond any !
question that Richmond Is the natural
center for this district, and. In my opin
ion, In the division of this country into
twelve natural districts, great violence
would bo done the natural trend of
business and convenience if Richmond
is omitted. It may not appear to be <
modest upon tho part of Richmond l/f
ask for everything 'that is going.' bit
if nature has decreed that she should
be so situated as to l>e most conven
iently reached, and that experience has
given business men more knowledge of
the varied needs of this section, she
will have to accept the decree, and we '
would be false to our trust if we did j
not bring these matters to the attention '
of the outside world.
"The passage of this rural credits'
bill by the Democratic administration J
is another proof of the great desire i
upon the part of the administration to!
leave behind It a record ofconstructive
legislation not equaled by any admin
istration in the past century. While;
there may be a great many points in
this bill Hint makes it more or '.ess!
cumbersome and unworkable. 1 believe'
ii Is the basis of a system of r,:ral*
credits which will be of untold value!
to the farmer, and indirectly it will j
favorably affect the life of every cit-;
l7.en of the United States."
