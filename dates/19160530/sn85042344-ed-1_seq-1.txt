Move Fruslrnle-d.
Hitchcock's arrangement Is that
when tho roll of states In called In
alphahi-ticnl order to make nomina
tions for president, to have Alabama,
tho first on the list, yield In favor
of New York so that Hughes may
havo tho advantage of having his
miinii presented first. When friondi-
of Root and Roosevelt learned of
this nlan they declared they would
attempt to get recognition from the
ehalrinan to present the name oi
their candidate before Hughes. 1 ney
said that the chairman of tho con
vention would bo obliged to Belli
the dispute at tho time It arises.
The total number nf contests filed
thus far Is forty, which involves the
right of 62 delegates to seats in the
convention.
Secretary Roynolds received notice
of u contest over tho eight Jelegales
at largo from Texas. The contest
was filed by C. J. Hostrajuier of
Houston, Texas, and will be heard
by tho committee when It mceta to
takn up contests Juno 1.
National Committeeman Ralph K
Williams of Oregon announced that
when the delegation of ten from hi
state arrives here Juno 4 he will
recommend that the five men chosen
as delegates to mo i rogre.ss.ve na
tional convention be seated as al
ternates In the Republican convention.
Tho list of alternates will be rilieo
by tho election of four unsuccessful
candidates for delegate and tho ad
dition of another. Hughes won in the
Oregon presidential preferential pri
mary, but the law makes no provision
for tho election of alternates in that
state. National Committeeman Will
lams will mako this recominendaton
In an efforts to unite the Republican
and Progressive factions.
