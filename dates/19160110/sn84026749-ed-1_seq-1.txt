Officials Deny Stories of Bomb
Plot as Cause of Jersey Ex
plosion. WILMINGTON, Del.. Jnn. lO.-Three
men were Instantly killed In a terrific
explosion In a "sweetie" machine house
In plant 'No.' 1, of the du Pont Powder
Company, at Carney's Point. N. J.,
early this morning.
A fourth man, who was a member of
the crew In the house, -escaped death
by reporting late for work. Powder was
being glazed with graphite when the
explosion occurred.
The dead men are John AValsh, P. C.
Wynne, and Richard Carney, the-latter
the foreman of the mill. None was In
jured. Officials todav denied reports that two
men had been arrested, and that dyna
mite, bombs wero found in their pos
session. It was stated that the explo
sion, followed a fire, which evidently
reached guncotton. A searching Inves
tigation la being made, however.
Deputy Coroner Corton aald he had
heard no talk of plots, and that to his
knowledge no arrests had been made.
The fire gave first warning of the
danger to men In the plant. This ac
counts for the small death toll.
Towns for miles around were shaken.
The explosion occurred at 12:30, a
few minutes after tho second night
shift went on dty. The early night
'shift had Just embarked on a ferry
boat when the blending tower of the
plant went up In the air. The boat
was onlv a few hundred feet out In
tho Delaware river, on Its way to
Wilmington, The men on board were
knocked from their feet, windows
wore shattered, and all lights extin
guished by the blast.
Many of the men were almost para
lyzed with' fear when the ferry boat
docked. All they could do was to
mutter Incoherently.
A few who mastered their emotion
declared they heard three explosions.
The first, which was followed by two
lesser ones, they said, was like a
thousand 42-ceutlmetre guns fired
'simultaneously.

by the force of the explosion.
The yeggmen, of whom there
are at least two, and probably
more, made their getaway with
$25 in cash and about $200 worth
of -stamps. One of the robbers is
thought to have been wounded by
fire from the shot gun of William
Reeley, the first to reach the scene
after the succession of explosions
that shook the little village.
Reeley saw the postoff ice lighted
and;.ayrtan making: hip way out the
door. fte fired two sots,tand two
shots were returned.

their Identity haa yet been learned.

With the exception of several dollars
In small coins, which were found' scat

yeggmen carried off all the valuables
