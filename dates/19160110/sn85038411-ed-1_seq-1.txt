If the Cops Must Swear, Let

Says Mayor
TO STUDY CITY LAWS
Possible That Meals Will
Establish School For
Patrolmen
I
Swearing while on duty will mean
punishment for attaches of the police
department.
"1 expect every employe under nie
to be a perfect gentleman," said
I Mayor E. S. Meals to-day. Asked if
any special set of rules would be pro
vided for employes of his depart
ment. the mayor said:
"There will be some organization
after January 15. Just as soon as I
have the new force working, every
man will be told his duty. You can't
be a gentleman and swear in public.
Of course I realize that there are
i times when a man MUST swear. He
can do it quietly."
Another thing that will be required
of patrolmen, will be a thorough
knowledge of city ordinances. Mayor
Meals said his patrolmen must know
the laws. "You can't enforce ordi
nances if you are not acquainted with
the provisions of the city laws," he
remarked. Mayor Meals has not de
cided whether there will be a school
established for the patrolmen. He is
of Ihe opinion that it woudl be a good
thing to have someone instruct the
olllcers on important ordinances.
