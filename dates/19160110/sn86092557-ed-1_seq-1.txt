Asked for Programs of

LEADERS AMONG THEM
Indications Are That There
Will Be No Dearth of
Plans.
Twenty-three architects, Including
some of the largest and most reputable
firms In the United States, have ap
plied for "programs of construction"
for Fairmont's proposed $350,000 ho
tel building. Most of these architects ]
have expressed their intentioi of en
tering the contest for archltea. of the
building, according to Carl Ritas, who I
with ltobert T. CunninKhari and |
George T. Watson, constitute ie com
mittee on architecture.
The "program of construct!?" pre
pared by ths committee, contains a
brief description of the kind ot build
ing wanted and carefully drawrf maps
showing the lay of the ground afcl the
exact size of the lot at Wash(!gton
and Jefferson streets whore It it pro
posed to erect the hotel. Anothesmap
shows the lay of the business sation
of the city, the location of thelrail
roads, the courthouse and the vakous
office buildings and stores of theldty.
Architects wishing to enter thel'.on
test for the hotel building mustlub
mit tentative plans by Jauuaryl25.
Shortly after this date a mectink of
the committee will be held at wiclj
the architect will probably be selected.
The usual architect's cctamlsBion ii 5
per cent., but in submitting the "ic
grams of construction," the committi
retains the right of making arrani
ments with the architect chosen J
garding the price.

FATAL WRECK IN CANADA
PORT ARTHUR, Ontario, Jan. JO.?
Two engineers and a fireraan.are re
ported killed in a head-on collision
a. Canadian Pacific train at Pepigon.
BY SARA MOORE.
Special Artist and Correspondence
With the Ford Peace Delegates.
The first scandal to develop on the
Ford peace ship came to light about
18 hours after the ship had left New
York.
After making farewell speeches on
the deck denouncing preparedness,
members of the Ford party were
proved to be secretly acting on the
principle they publicly repudiated.
Preparedness in cabin 3 saved the
day. Two hundred and fifty doses
of MothersiU's remedy for seasick
ness had been brought aboard ship by
Elizabeth Watson.
Long lanes of scasick stenographers
festooned tlie ship. The few Beawlse
delegates tried to dodge the effects
of rough weather by rushing up and
down deck between peace speeches.
Inez Milholland Boissevain, amazon
suffragist, succumbed without a strug
gle. Katherine Leckie, Ford's official
director of journalists, who had been
working 20 hours a day, insisted that
she was having a good time, but she
was not hungry.
The 250 doses of MothersiU's had
almost disappeared by the third morn
Ing and reporters began to play pol
itics to get a pull wfth Miss Watson.
Every one of the newspaper people
secreted a dose, in case they needed
to be braced up for at least one day's
work before reaching land.
I Mr. Ford was not ill. Twice a day
he met the journalists in the second
! cabin dining room. Pale, green wo
i men and saffron-colored men bombard
;ed him with questions.
Mrs. Boissevain holds the peace
part/ long distance record for sea
sickness. Katherine Leckie's indispo
sition had the most dramatic features.
The steward refused to open the
porthole in her room, and at the end
iof four days she rang for him violent
ly
Her perfectly good Chicago argu
ments fell on Scandinavian ears. He
said "No" in Danish, German and
Swedish. Miss Leckie did a motion
picture revelation of her wrath and
distress.
'UNPREPAREDI^ESS" LAYS PEACE PILGRIMS LOW!
BUT BATTLE IS JUST WITH THE WILD. WILD WAVES!
"If you don't open that window I
shall jump overboard!" she stormed.
"If I jump overboard you will get into
trouble. I am a very important per
son in the Ford party."
Still the steward regretted.
"I am a very Important person in
the United States," continued Miss
Leckie sternly. "If I jump overboard
every newspaper reporter on this ship
will write about it. The United
States will be furious if I Jump over
board."
She stalked to the door. The stew
ard hesitated. Fear of what the Unit
ed States might do if Katherine Leck
ic was deprived of air and life seized
him.
"You can have five minutes' wind,"
he agreed, and unlocked the porthole.

JOOGE HAYMOND
TOO ILL TO BE
ON BENCH TODAY
Expected Charter Case De
ciation is Again Defer
red.
Judge W. S. Haymond was unable
to appear in Circuit Court this fore
noon being confined to bis bed at
home with grip, according to a mes
sage sent to Clerk W. S. Black. As a
result Attorney Henry S. Lively was
elected by the other attorneys of this
county in attendance at court' th<s
morning to act as temporary judge
during the illness of Judge Haymond.
The drst business to come before
Judge Lively was the case of tho'Og
den investment company against
George M. Lilley, which has liecn on
trial before a jury for nearly a week.
The jury which has been instructed by
Judge Haymond .Friday and which
had failed to arrive at a verdict after
considerable deliberation Saturday,
this forenoon asked to have tho in
structions of the court re-read. This
request was complied with by Judge
Lively after which the jury retired
to the jury room to continue its de
liberations.
The Illness of Judge Haymond will
cause a further delay in geeting a
decision In the Fairmont Charter case
as litigation of this character cannot
be decided by a temporary judge. Ac
accordlng to the statements made at
court house this forenoon Judge Hay
mond probably will not be able to ap
pear In court until Wednesday or
Thursday.
After directing Ogden-Lilley jury
to continue their deliberations Judge
Lively disposed of a considerable
amount of routine business.
Trial of Mrs, Mohr
Begins at Providence
HARD TO GET JURYMEN TO
SIT IN THIS MURDER
CASE
(By Associated Press)
PROVIDENCE, R. I., Jan. 10.?Mrs.
Elizabeth S. Molir accused of having
instigated three negroes to murder her
husband. Dr. C. Franklin Mohr, a
physician well-known in this city and
Newport, was placed on trial before
Judge Charles S. SternB in the Super
ior Court today.
Mrs. Mohr is being tried jointly with
Cecil B. Brown and Henry H. Spell
man, who are charged witli the actual
commission of the murder while, the
Doctor and his secretary, Mica Emily
C. Burger, were motoring toward New
port on the night or August 31, last.
Mrs. Mohr was indicted as an ac
cessory before the fact. The throe de
fendants pleaded not guilty when ar
raigned and the selection of a jury
was begun.
Owing to the reluctance of many
veniremen to sit in a murder trial it
is expected the work of empanelling a
jury will be slow.
