SEE MONEY DELAY
FOR PREPAREDNESS
Members Expect Issue to
Center in Ways and Means
Pnmmittpp
FEAR POLITICAL EFFECT
OF ADDITIONAL TAX LEVY
Think Naval Appropriations Bill
Will Not Be Beady Until Late
in the Summer.
Some of the wisest men in Congress
pointed out today that the
national defense question does not
center in the military and naval
affairs committees, which arc now
holding open hearings on the subject.
but in the ways and means
committee, which has not yet
made a move toward settling the
all-important question of wjtere
the money is coming from to pay
for the program. And this leaves
the matter somewhat as a veteran
representative explained it:
"My Uncle Hob was going to
get me a tine shotgun once, but before
we went down to the
store he said: 'Son. let's stop at
the bank and see it 1 have money
enough. " ]
Delay for Appropriations Bill.
A member of the naval affairs committee
who knows every one in the
House by his first name said some tim? ?
a^o that the naval appropriations bill ]
would not be reported until the sun j
was srood and hot. He was asked to
day if he had changed his mind:
"Not on your life, boy," he replied,
except that the sun will be hotter." '
The reason for these observations on r
the part of certain lawmakers who
have to return to their homes and point '
to the record in order to get votes j
enough to come back to Washington is
that no one seems willing to make the .
flrst move to lay the taxes which will J
raise the added two hundred millions
necessary to provide for the flrst year's
program of defense.
Bhymester Objects to Tax.
'Yes," said a man from Pennsylvania.
a republican of long standing in
the House. "There is a coal dealer up !
in my town who sent me a letter writ- j
en in rhyme, and this is an extract j
from it: <
Just give enough of arms and ships 1
to show we won't be lax. 1
Rut hear our cry, dear congressman,
and please don't raise the tax." '
Straus like these seem to show '
u here the wind is heading from, and it '
is straws like these which may break
the back of the program if enough of
them pile up.
The attitude of the rank and flle of
The democrats is to support the President's
program openly, but they do not
lik^ the looks of another tax bill.
As usual, the ways and means committee
has not found an article on
which it can propose a tax that does
not stir up a terrible fuss somewhere.
Attitude of Republicans.
The rank and flle of the republicans
have always wanted n large navy,
speaking in general, but the older
heads in that party are pointing out
that if the republicans rush pell-mell ,
into the House and vote a big increase
through the democrats may have the
chance to say, "Well, the republican
votes are what really put over the increased
navy and the resulting necessity
for a tax."
Therefore, every one seems to be
watching the other fellow.
"bet's step up to the counter and borrow
the money with Christian forti:ude,
and not tax everybody in sight,"
said a young democrat today.
"There'll be no naval bill in the House
: : 111 we know where the money is
oming from." said a republican.
And there the matter rests today.
$594,000 ADDITIONAL ASKED.
Secretary McAdoo Transmits Estimate
for Lincoln Memorial.
Secretary McAdoo has transmitted to
i-ongrres an estimate or tne Lincoln
memorial commission, requesting a
supplemental appropriation of $594,000
for additions to the Lincoln memorial
now under construction here. The
extra fund Is to complete approaches
to the building.
The cost of the structure, by congressional
limitation, cannot exceed $2,000,000.
There already has been appropriated
$1,300,000. With the $591,000 j
added, there will remain in the fund I
$106,000.
THREE BODIES RECOVERED.
Found in Stateroom of Ohio River
Packet Kanawha.
PARKER8BURG, W. Va, January
10.?Three bodies were recovered today
from the wreck of the Pittsburgh and
Charleston packet Kanawha, which sank
in the Ohio river near here l?*t WeHn**
Jay night. Two were identified as Mrs.
K. C. Atkinson and Mrs. Ulysses Beegle
of Racine, Ohio, but the searchers were
unable to identify the other, also a
woman.
The bodies were found huddled to- |
gether in one o? the staterooms. The i
women apparently fled when the storm
struck the boat. The river began to fall
more rapidly today, and it was expected
that before nightfall search of the entire
boat would be completed.

EXPECT TO SEnLE
LUSITANIA CASE
Secretary Lansing Presents
n..n: x n i a - _
uuiiine or rroposea agreement
to German Envoy.
BUT ONE MORE EXCHANGE
IS BELIEVED NECESSARY
Phraseology of Formal Disavowal
Thought to Be Point on Which
the Delay Hinges.
Count von Rernstorff, the German
ambassador, and Secretary Lansing had
another conference in the Lusitania negotiations
today which both agreed
should be described as confidential.
The results of the conference between
the Secretary and the ambassador
were communicated to President Wilson.
and at the White House a feeling of
optimism was evident. It was understood
that Mr. Lansing had presented
to the ambassador today the outline.
it least, of an agreement which would
be satisfactory to the United States,
and which he hoped would alsa be
satisfactory to Germany. It was said
that both officials realized they were
iealing with public opinion in their
awn countries.
The ambassador expects to confer
with the Secretary attain within a
week and not again on the subject.
That fact 4s taken by those conversant
with the status of the case to mean
that Germany and the United States
have approached a point in the negotiations
where only one more exchange
between Washington and Berlin will
be necessary before the long controversy
is ended.
Officials Are "Very Hopeful."
American officials In all quarters described
the situation as "very hopeful."
and reflected the view that a satisfactory
settlement Is In sight which
will include indemnities for the 115
American lives lost and spme expression
of regret or disavowal which will
be mutually satisfactory to Germany
and the United States.
President Wilson, Secreta-y Lansing
and the German ambassador are practically
the only officials in the secret of
the negotiations, but it is known that
the Drincinal Doint which has been de
laying" the final settlement was the
phraseology. Germany has contended
that the best disavowal she could offer
was her orders to submarine commanders
not to repeat such an incident
md that she could not disavow the action.
although she regretted the loss of
so many Americans. The United States
has been contending that the disavowal
ihould be expressed in some way. It
is believed that a form of expression
las been found which will be satisfactory
to both and that one more exchange
between Washington and Berlin
will settle the case unless something
unforeseen comes up.
It was stated authoritatively today
that the next step of the United States
will be to ask all of the allies of
lermany to agree that no vessels carrying
Americans be attacked unil passengers
and crew have been placed
in safety. Exactly what procedure
Aill be followed was not revealed. The
idministration is said to take the position
that as Germany now has agreed
iti all the principal points of the position
of the United States, the only
thing remaining to bring the negotiations
to a satisfactory solution is for
tier allies to follow her lead.
The impression grows among administration
officials that the nationality
of the submarine or mine which sank
th** Persia will never be disclosed.
American Consul Keblfnger at Malta
tuutiv iiuvineu mp ntaxi department
that no new facts concerning the destruction
of the steamship Persia were
contained iq affidavits he had taken
from seven survivors, including Lord
Montagu, who had landed there. The
survivors were unanimous in saying that
although the officers of the ship were
watching for submarines, none was seen
and no warning was given.

Invitations to Attend Banquets Received
and New York Defenses
Discussed.
President Wilson was swamped with
visitors today, his engagement list being
filled for every minute from 10 o'clock
until his luncheon hour, 1 o'clock. In
that time he discussed almose every
subject imaginable with his callers.
The Supreme Court of the United
States vacancy was one of the subjects
that added to his engagement list. Senator
Stone and Representatives Dickerson,
Decker and Ruby, representing the entire
democratic delegation in Congress
from Missouri, called on the President
and presented the name of Judge W. W.
Graves of that state as eminently qualified
for the vacancy. Representatives
Tague and Phelan of Massac Jiusetts
urged upon the President the nomination
of Justice Charles DeCoursey of the supreme
court of that state.
Senator Kardwick of Georgia urged
the President to appoint Alex King, a
noted Georgia lawyer, practically the
entire bar of the state being for Mr.
King. Senator Hardwick also discussed
with the President the cotton
situation in the south as affected by
the British orders in council. The
President stated that the State Department
is doing everything possible
at this time to protect the cotton industry
and interests against the complaints
of British disregard of American
rights.
This afternoon the President will
consult with Attorney General Gregory
as to the Supreme Court vacancy,
going over the names of candidates
presented up to this time.
Invited to State Club Banquet.
President Wilson received a cordial
invitation from the New Jersey Society
of the District to attend its annual banquet,
January 18. He said that he
would consult with Mrs. Wilson as to
the elate, and if they could attend they
would do so. The invitation was presented
by a committee consisting of
Joseph O'Long, John J. Keenan, E. J.
Ayers, J. A. Edgerton and John P.
O'Neille. The same committee also invited
Secretary Tumulty, Secretary
Garrison of the War Department, Associate
Justice Pitney of the Supreme
Court of the United States and Comrnis
sioner Daniels of the interstate commerce'
commission.
Another invitation extended to the
President was from the Merchants' and
Manufacturer's Association of Baltimore
to attend the annual banquet of
the association, January 27. Senator
John Walter Smith headed the delegation,
and the President told his visitors
that h^. would consider the invitation.
Maj. John Burke, so long associated
with Buffalo Bill, and how living with
the family of Allison N'ailor, in this
city, paid his respects to the President.
The Nailor family raised Maj. Burke
as an orphan boy. He takes pride in
the fact that h- has visited and talked
with every President since Buchanan,
and that he saw President Lincoln under
fire at the battle of Fort Stevens
when Early made his famous raid on
Washington. Maj. Burke, then a young
man, went out wkjth other local patriots,
one of them being Washington
Nailor.
New York Defenses Discussed.
Former Representative Levy of New !
York, who also called at.- the White |
House, said that he had talked with
Secretary Garrison this morning about i
the defenses of New York. Mr. Levy !
complains that the 12-inch guns defending
New York are entirely inadequate
and ought to be replaced with
16-inch guns of .4a-caliber. He asserts)
that disappearing carriages are no |
longer suitable for big guns, and urged
Mr. Garrison seriously to consider the
defense conditions at New York. Mr. j
Levy says that all the younger officers I
of the army regard the present guns j
defending New York as utterly incapable
of doing wha is required* of them
under modern conditions of warfare. j
Senator Owen talked with the Presi- I
dent some time about the rural credits I
bill that has been reported by the joint)
committee of Congress that has been j
working upon the measure so long, j
hearings upon which will start Friday.
It is understood the President
favors the principles of the bill and
will use his influence to have it become
law. Senator Owens wants a permanent
tariff commission, and urged the
President to get back of a bill that will
provide such a commission, which the
business of the country is advocating.
Asked to Address Teachers.
Representative Fields of Kentucky
introduced to the President Mrs. Cora
Wilson Stewart, president of the illiteracy
commission of that state, who
invited the President to visit Frankfort
in February to address a meeting
of volunteer teachers who are engaged
in instructing illiterates.
A delegation from llw- Presbyterian
Social Union of Philadelphia, which is
to hold its annual dinner February 28,
invited President and Mrs. Wilson to
be present. The President did not give
a definite answer, but probably will
not be able to accept, it was said.

chairman of Michigan, conferred with

a large number of letters from judges,
district attorneys and prominent men
from up-state in New York, urging ihe
President to name a man from above
Greater New York for the circuit court
vacancy made by the retirement of
Judge bacombe. Mr. Oglesby told the
President that the New York counties
would appreciate the honor, and suggested
that he consider some of the
names that have been presented to him.
President \\ ilson possibly may put
the question of national defense before
the country in a series of
speeches as one means of getting the
necessary legislation through Congress.
Officials intimated today that the
President might take advantage of the
invitations to lay the administration
plan lor national defense directly before
the people. As soon as the submarine
controversy Is entirely cleared up
the President intends to devote his
whole attention to getting the national
defense plans through Congress.

PRESIDENT TO APPOINT
i WHITE MAN RECORDER
i
Tells Bishop Walters He Has Decided
Not to Give Place to
Colored Person.
President Wilson has decided definitely
that he will not he able to nominate
a colored man for recorder of deeds of
the District, to fill the vacancy that
has existed for eighteen months, and
that he will give the position to a white
' man, believed to be a resident of the
i District of Columbia. In place of the
recordership, he wil seek to f?nd three
or four other good places to bestow
upon colored democrats.
The President made his position
known today to Bishop Alexander Walters,
head of the third episcopal district
of the A. M. E. Church, which includes
the churches of that denomination In
t ne uisirici or Loiumnia. nisnop waiters
is president of the National Negro
Democratic League, v/hieh gave the
administration loyal and effective support
In many of the pivotal states in
the last election.
Bishop Walters has been earnestly
urging the President for nearly three
years to give greater recognition to
colored democrats and lias especially
! urged that the recordership, so long
held by a man of that race, should
again go to a man representing the
negro.
Fears Senate Fight.
The President told Bishop Walters
today that he would like to select a
colored man recorder, but that his information
was that such action on his
part would precipitate a \bitter race
fight in the Senate, resulting in illfeeling
and no benefit to anybody.
Inasmuch as lie would not be able to
satisfy the desires of Bishop Walters
and colored democrats so far as the
recordership goes, the President suggested
that he would try to find three
or four good places In the departmental
service. To carry out that promise he
directed Bishop Walters to confer with
Secretary McAdoo and Postmaster General
Burleson for the purpose of having
them find positions which would be
satisfactory.
Whether the President has selected
the white man who is to become recorder
could not be learned, but It Is '
said that he has a man in mind. His
decision today is believed to indicate
an early selection for the position.
Revolt on Isle of Samos.
ATHENS, January 9, via Paris, January
10.?The Greek cruiser Helli and
the destroyer Leon, with a strong contingent

FACE SECOND TRIAL

Case of Five Unacquitted Directors
Being Considered
in
in vvasmiiyiun.
SPECIAL U. S. ATTORNEY
COMING TO THE CAPITAL
Decision Will Be Reached After Mr.
Batts Has Conferred With Department
of Justice.
NEW YORK, January 10.?Five former
directors of the New York, New
Haven and Hartford Railroad Company
today face the probability of another
trial on charges of conspiracy to monopolize
the railway traffic of New
England. Concerning their guilt or innocence
of this charge the jury in the
first trial was unable to agree.
The five are William Rockefeller and
Lewis Cass Ledyard of New York.
Charles M. Pratt of Brooklyn, Charles
F. Brooker of Ansonia, Conn., and Edward
D. Robbins of New Haven, Conn.
The other six former directors tried on
the same charge were acquitted in a
verdict returned at 4:30 p.m. yesterday.
Mr. Batts Coming to Washington.
Announcing that he would move for
a new trial for the five men, R. L.
Batts of counsel for the government
said this step would be taken "in due
time." He did not indicate how soon
he would resume proceedings against
them.
Few opinions as to the action of the
jury were publicly expressed by those
most concerned today. Mr. Ledyard
would say nothing, but Mr. Brooker
said: "We are still in the same boat
and the water appears calm."
Mr. Batts announced today that he
would go to Washington tomorrow to
confer with the Attorney General as to
future action in the case.
Decision About a New Trial
for Directors of New Haven
Pvnonforl Within Pou/ Hov/c
UAfJUUlVU ?I I VI 111 I I V> V* I/Ujvj
The course of the Department of Justice
in the New Haven case will be determined
within a few days, Attorney
General Gregory said today. The Attorney
General will consult with R. L.
Batts, the government's special counsel
in the case, before determining
whether he will seek new trials for the
five directors on whom the jury disagreed.
Other officials of the Department
of Justice are of the opinion that
a new trial will be begun within a
short time.
Some officials of the department are
plainly gratified over the fact that so
many of the defendants failed to secure
acquittal, and took the view that the
men about whom the jury disagreed
were the most prominent figures in the
upbuilding of the New Haven system.
Officials have been keenly interested
in the outcome of this case. It was
begun virtually at the direction of
President Wilson, who took a decided
interest in the negotiations between
the Department of Justice and the
present management of the New Haven
which resulted ultimately in the separation
of the New Haven and its subsidiaries.
The attempt to untangle the
New Haven had dragged along for
many months and apparently the negotiations
had arrived at a point which
they could not pass in July, 1914, when
the President wrote a letter to the then
Attorney General, now Associate Justice
McReynolds of the Supreme Court,
directing the institution of a civil suit
under the Sherman law to bring about
the dissolution, and also that "the
criminal aspects of the case" be laid
before a federal grand Jury. Later the
necessity for civil mrosecutlon was obviated
by the dissoMtion agreement.

MOHR MURDER TRIAL
BEGUN AT PROVIDENCE
Physician's Wife and Two NegToef"
Plead Not Guilty?Separate
Trial Is Denied.
PROVIDENCE. R. I., January 10.?Efforts
to establish responsibility for the
murder of Dr. C. Franklin Mohr August
ox mm Hill wr iilduc u ? mc fJIUOCCU"
tlon in the trial of his wife, Mrs. Elizabeth
F. Mohr, and two negroes, Cecil V.
Brown and Henry Spellman, which was
begun here today. Justice Charles F.
Stearns will preside. The negroes are
directly charged with murder. Mrs.
Mohr was indicted as an accessory before
the fact. A murder indictment
against Mohr's negro chauffeur, George
W. Healis, was quashed last week,
wheii Healis was brought into court
and did not contest a charge of manslaughter.
s
The three defendants pleaded not
guilty when arraigned and the selection
of a jury was begun. Owing to
the reluctance of many veniremen to
sit in a murder trial, it is expected the
work of impaneling the jury will be
slow.
Spellman's Attorney Appointed.
The court appointed John B Edwards
as attorney for Spellman, but refused
the request of William H. Lewis of
Boston, former assistant United States
attorney general, that he be named to
represent Brown, on the ground that
Lewis is a non-resident of the state.
John J. Fitzgerald. Arthur Cushing,
William E. Carroll and James E. McCartin
appeared for Mrs. Mohr. The
state was represented by Attorney General
Herbert A. Rice and two assistants.
Mrs. Mohr entered the room dressed
in mourning. She was pale, but appeared
in good spirits.
Attorney Cushing asked for a separate
trial for Mrs. Mohr, claiming that
as alleged confessions by the negroes
were to be introduced by the prosecution,
his client could not obtain a fair
trial, but the court denied the motion.
As disclosed in the preliminary hearings,
the state will seek to show that
Mrs. Mohr instigated Brown and Spellman
to shoot her husband, and induced
Healis to stop the automobile In which
Dr. Mohr was riding at t.he spot on a
country road in West Barrington where
the murder took place.
Dr. Mohr, who was accompanied by
his secretary. Miss Emily Burger, was
shot from ambysh while his automobile
was stalled. He died without re
{gaining consciousness, but JVIiss Burger,
I although shot twice, survived.
It is understood that Healis will appear
as the state's principal witness.
Mrs. Mohr has maintained that she
and her husband were both victims of
conspiracies by the negroes, and that
they falsely directed suspicion against
her when they were apprehended. She
is at liberty under bond.
ADVOCATES ABOLITION
OF BOARD OF CHARITIES
Dr. George M. Kober, member of the
board of charities.^ who appeared before
the subcommittee .in charge of the appropriation
bill today, recommended
that Congress adopt the proposal of
the District Commissioners* to do away
with the board of charities, and substitute
therefore a director of charities
who would be assisted by an advistory
board.
Hearings on the District bill have
raniHlv and I hp mamhoro ~ f
the subcommittee soon will be in a position
to work on a tentative draft of
the measure.
Possibly the most interesting of all
the hearings will take place tomorrow,
when the Commissioners' recommendation
to centralize the control of the
schools, abolish the board of education,
take over the appointive power as to
teachers and create a director of education,
will be argued. It is expected
that members of the board of education
will be present at the hearing, as well
as the Commissioners.

BERLIN. January 10, by wireless
to Sayville, N. Y.?The British

according to Constantinople advices
given out today by the
Overseas News Agency. It is
said the Turks have advanced to

The main British army in
Mesopotamia, according to these
advices, is in retreat, 10,000 men

to cover the movement.

I The retreat from Kut-El-Amara?asI
sumingr the correctness of the unofficial 1
advices from Berlin?apparently means
the abandonment by the British of any
attempt, for the present, at least, at an
offensive campaign in Mesopotamia.
It was in N'ovember of 1914 that an
Anglo-Indian force, starting from the
Persian gulf, began marching north
and west over the desert, following the
Tigris and Euphrates rivers wherever
possible.
Within Eighteen Miles of Bagdad.
The fighting was exhausting, but the
British pushed northward steadily until,
in September of 1915, they reached
Kut-El-Amara. which is 230 miles
northwest of the head of the Persian
gulf. They .defeated the Turks there
and advanced to Ctesiphon, eighteen
miles below Bagdad.
The Turks sent up large forces to
save Bagdad, and after an initial defeat
again attacked and won a victory
over the invaders. The British fell
back on Kut-El-Amara. JOi> miles

tilled with troops, at the time
of the withdrawal of the French
and British forces from the tip

Enormous Lot of Booty.
The following: dispatch under date of
Constantinople was made public by the
news agency:
"The Mill! Agency states that the
Turks were making preparations for
three days for the attack on the British
and French, and that the results
are not yet fully known. All the positions

and Teke Burnu were occupied by the
Turks, nine cannon being captured.
Turkish artillery sank an enemy transport
filled with soldiers. An enormous
amount of booty was captured.

enemy biplane near Seddul-Bahr.
Joy in Constantinople
"The news of the definite failure of
the Dardanelles expedition arouses enormous
joy and satisfaction In Constantinople,"
says the Overseas News
Agency in a message distributed today.
"Bunting was displayed and the
schools were closed.
"The Berlin newspapers," continues
the agency message, "point out the loss
of prestige which this means for the
British, besides the enormous losses of
men, ships and money. They recall the
proud words of Air. Asquith, in parliament,
on the 9th of November, 1914,
that the Turkish empire had committed
suicide and had dug its own grave, and
those of Mr. Churchill, at a later date,
that through the Dardanelles lay the
shortest road to triumphant peace. The
newspapers further call attention to
the fact that important Turkish contingents
are now free for action in
other fields."
Announced in London.
LONDON. January 10.?It is officially
announced that the complete evacuation
of the Gallipoli peninsula has
been successfully c arried out.
Gen. Sir Charles Monro, according to
the official statement, reports that only
one British soldier was wounded in the
evacuation of the Gallipoli peninsula,
that there were no casualties among
the French and that all the guns were
.s;ivpri pxceut seventeen wornout ones
which were blown up.
The official communication issued last
evening says:
Official British Statement.
"Gen. Sir Charles Monro reports
the complete evacuation of Gallipoli
has been successfully carried out.
"All the guns and howitzers were
got away, with the exception of seventeen
wornout guns, which were blown
up by us before leaving.
"Our casualties amounted to one
member of the British rank and tile,
wounded. There were no casualties
among the French.
"Gen. Monro states that the accomplishment
of this difficult task was due
to Gens. Bird wood and Da vies, arid invaluable
assistance rendered in an operation
of the highest difficulty by Admiral
de Robeck and the Royal Navy."
Evacuation Brings Relief.
The London morning papers comment
with satisfaction and relief on the successful
evacuation of Gallipoli. They
consider, despite Gen. Monro's generous
tribute to Gens. Birdwood and Davies.
that credit for the remarkable double
retirement should be attributed to
Gen. Monro himself. The Times says
editorially:
??* *...i.... T,.?.

Monro has managed 10 remove his
men and guns under the eyes of the
Turks acfid their German officers. We
doubt if a precedent for such an
achievement can be found in the annals
of war.
"The extraordinary freedom from
casualties at Helles is explainable to
some extent by the fact that, unlike
Ansae and Suvla, it gave us one beach
sb ^rcd from the enemy's fire. But
neither operation would have been possible
with any but the boldest and
steadiest troops. The government may
be congratulated on their prompt decision
of the complete evacuation of
the peninsula."
