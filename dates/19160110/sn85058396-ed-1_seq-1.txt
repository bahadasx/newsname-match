Berlin Minimizes Seriousness
of Emperor's Illness Admit
Malignant Growth in
Throat.
Rome, Jan. 9, 3:20 p. m. The lat
est reports received here regarding
the condition of the German emperor
minimize the seriousness of his con
dition and contradict wild rumors
circulated not long ago. These re
ports, received from Germany through
Swltbcrland, say that tho Emperor is
aifected by a malignant growth in the
throat which required a small opera
tion. Although the operation was
slight, it is said, the greatest care
was indispensable owing to tho deli

A high church official who under

that the doctors believed that if com
plications did not arise, a contingency
they think unlikely, the emperor will

UNPARALLELED

Comptroller of Currency De
scribes Development in Fi
. nancial History of
Country.
U. S. BANKING POWER
Fight Against Usury in Na
tional Banks Outlined Ef
fect of High Rates on
Business.
Washington, Jan. 10. "Develop
ment and growth never paralleled in
the financial history of any country,"
is the way John Skelton Williams,
comptroller of the currency, describes
in his annual report to congress, the
operation of the national banks under
his charge, from October, 1914, to No
vember, 1915, the first year under the
Federal Reserve system.
The report today was presented to
congress.
Mr. Williams gives a comparative
statement of the condition of the na
tional banks. He shows net resources
increased in the year $1,743,878,648,
deposits increased $2,081,530,164 and
loans and discounts increased $917,
450,502. Available cash increased
$8a2,000,000 and on Novmeber 10, 1915,
the reporting national banks had ex
cess reserves of $891,000,000. Tables
show the comparative condition of
banks in 1895 and 1915. In .Septem
ber, 1895, there were 3,712 reporting
banks with net deposits of $1,980,000,
000, and loans and discounts of $2,
059,408,402, while in November, 1915,
there were 7,617 reporting banks with
net deposits of $9,079,471,447, loans
and discounts of $7,233,928,973.
"The reserves held by the national
banks November 10, 1915," says the
report, "exceeded by $587,000,000 the
greatest reserves ever held prior to
passage of the federal reserve act.
Loans and discounts amountd to more
than tho total loans and discounts of
all banks, including national, state,
pavings and private banks and loan
and trust companies as late as the
year 1902."
Banking Power of U. S.
Mr Williams says tho "banking
power" of the United States capital
surplus, circulation deposits, etc. of
..alL reporting, banks, -with an estimate
of the figures for non-reporting banks,
amounted in June, 1915, to $25,397,
100.000, an increase in a year of about
$1,057,100,000. Savings bank deposi
tors increased by 176,256 during the
3 ear ending last June with toal de
posits of $4,997,706,013, an increase of
$61,114,163. The average deposit de
creased from $444.36 to S442.S3, but
the number of banks increased from
2100 to 2159.
The comptroller's principal recom
mendation for legislation is for an
amendment to the bank law directing
the department of justice to sue
usurers on information from the comp
troller or other sources.
Other recommendations for prevent
ing bank failures proposes: To pro
hibit officers borrowing from their
own banks; to prevent loans to di
rectors except with approval of the
board; to require officers and em
ployes to give surety bonds; to limit
direct and Indirect loans to one in
dividual, form or corporation, to pre
vent or limit overdrafts; to require
certificates of deposit to be signed by
two directors; to prevent erasures on
bank books, to limit interest paid on
deposits: to authorize establishment
of branches in the United States; to
permit branches in Alaska and insular
possessions; to authorizo minimum In
terest charges which ordinarily
might be usurious on small loans and
to authorizo the comptroller to pro
ceed against directors for losses sus
tained by a bank through violation of
the bank act.
Banks Broken by Bankers.
"Banks," says Mr. Williams, "nearlj'
always are broken, not by bank rob
bers, who have come from the outside,
nor by failure of customers to whom
they have lent money, but by the ty
ing up or dissipation of tho banks'
funds through loans to their own offi
cers and directors, or else by direct
defalcations and embezzlements by
trusted officers. If these evils are
remedied and they can be remedied
If certain simple and much needed
amendments can be secured to the
national bank act failures among na
tional banks can be reduced to a neg
ligible number, or bo absolutely elim
inated." Mr. Williams shows there were 14
failures in the 12 months ended Oc
tober 31; that in tho last fifty years
there were 208 failures attributable
to criminal acts; that injudicious or
careless banking was responsible for
ICG others.
The comptroller details his side of
the fight with national banks to pre
vent usurious interest rates. He gives
figures to back up his charges and
says complaints of this practice havo
been particularly directed against
small banks in the south and south
west, west and northwest.
Mr Williams says that usury un
checked means "depopulation, hope
lessness, Ihriftlessness and resulting
loss of producing capacity." He closes
with the statement that intimate con
nection with the affairs of his office
has shown that the majority of Amer
ican bankers are honest and anxious
to obey the laws, aud are intent on
building up their communities and the
country."

Paris, Jan. 10, 4:35 a. m. The
Italian animal sculptor Rembrandt
Bugatti, was found lying unconscious
yesterday in his studio In Rue Joseph,
Bara. A physician who was sum
moned said the sculptor was suffer
ing from gas poisoning. A gas Jet
in the studio was turned on. Bugatti
was taken to Laennec hospital, where
he died.
The work of Slgnor Bugatti, who
was regarded as one of the greatest
living sculptors, is represented in
most of the galleries of Europe. When
tne Avar openea ue was moueinng
animals at the zoological gardens in
Antwerp. He gave up this work and
.devoted himself to assisting the Bel
gian ambulance corps. When Ant
werp was evacuated he went to Hol
land and thence to Italy, but as his
class was not mobilized he came to
Paris.
War Depresses Sculptor.
Of late months the war seemed to
have affected the sculptor profoundly.
He was greatly depressed by the suf
ferings of the Belgians, for whom he
had great admiration. He frequently
pointed to the ribbon of the Legion
of Honor In his buttonhole and said:
"I ought to give it to some mutilated
Belgian soldier"
Slgnor Bugatti gave up some time
ago his work in the specialty which
won his fame, saying: "This is not
the time to make animals," He de
voted himself entirely to a new in
terpretation of Christ. This work,
now at the foundry. Is his last.

"Monsignor Heylon, bishop of Na

military governor of Belgium, to for
eign diplomats and consuls in Bel
glum, to the Vatican and to the Bel

(primate of Belgium) together with

has not been answered."
Bishops Send Collective Letter.
Paris, Jan. 10. 4:40 a. m. "The

spondent of the Petit Parislen. The
Belgian bishops who signed tho letter
affirm that they themselves conduct
ed an Investigation, village by village,
which demonstrated that the report of
the official Belgian committee under
estimated the facts of anything.
"To cut short the controversy they
proposed tho formation of a court
composed of an equal number of Bel

bishops and neutral prelates. Such a

at the Du Pont plant returning to H
their homes in Wilmington, across the I IH
river, were injured. Tho report of i IH
the explosion was distinctly heard in VM
this city, 25 miles distant. H
Story of Employe. H
According to an employe who wit- H
nessed the accident, the explosion oc- H
curred In No. v2 wet house and No. 2 H
blending tower of plant No. 2, shortly I B
after the midnight shift of workmen M
came on. He declared that it was JM
caused by outside influence and it was VM
reported "that two men with dynamite H
and nitroglycerine in their possession H
had been arrested. This report, how- ( lH
ever could not be confirmed. Wire wM
communication with Carney's Point IH
was severed by the explosion, and of- VM
ficial3 of the company in Wilmington H
declared they had absolutely no ad- IH
vices except the fact that there had H
been an explosion. It is known, how- VM
ever, that recently the force of secret ( IH
service agents about the plant had H
been largely increasd. H
Divisions in num- h
The plant is divided into three di- H
visions, No. 1, 2 and '3. Approximate- H
lv 15,000 workmen are employed and m
the plant was running twenty-four JM
hours a day. Only smokeless powder H
and picric acid, the latter an ingredl- H
ent of the deadly liddite used in mak- H
ing shrapnel, are manufactured at J H
these works. Most of the structures , H
are one-story in height, of scantling H
and covered with sheet iron. H
The blending towers, four stones H
high, are the tallest buildings. Here H
is where the powder is sorted. The H
towers resemble grain elevators. For H
purposes of safety chutes extend from , H
each floor and down which the work- H
nen slide to safety in case of accl-
d6?he wet house is where the : powder H
is taken after it is mixed. Here It is m
steamed under pressure for one hun- H
dred hours and then goes in turn to m
thT drying house and the blending H
tQThere have been several fires at tha H
Carney's Point plant, but this : Is the H
first time that an explosion has oc M
curred there. j H
