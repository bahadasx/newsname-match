POLICY IN ENFORCEMENT
OF ANTITRUST STATUTE
Attitude of Department of Justice
Outlined in Statement Made toy
Attorney-General.
I.WV MUCH MiSlXDKKSTOOD
Chamber of Commerce of United
States A1111 turners Results of Cun
foreiices Held With Purpose of
Hcnssurinx Public Mind.
WASIIIWTOX, January 'J. -The
policy of the Or-par tin out of Justice In
the enforcement of the antitrust laws is
outlluerl at length in a statement made
public to-night by the Chamber of
Commerce of the United States, an
nouiiciii^ the result of se vera I confer
ences between Mr. Oregory and a com
mittee of the organization.
The outline, which was submitted to
and approved by the Attorney^iieneralf
'is prefaced by an explanation that the
(chamber has constantly been presented
'with Inquiries with regard to the rej
ilatlonship that might be established
between the Federal Trade Commission
and the department, and with requests
for information as to the government's
attitude in future antitrust proceed -
ings. The Attorney-CIeneral was told,
tiie statement says, that an expression
from him |'ntight in- regarded as re
| assuring: to the public mind," and
might "dispel some of the Uncertainty
which heretofore existed."
P.y way of introduction, the Attorney
tjeneral said there is much misunder
standing' of tiie Sherman act in some
quarters, where it is regarded as a
statute apart from the general body
of laws. < hi the contrary, he explained;
it is enforced by the Department of
.Justice in the same mariner and accord
ing to lite same ruh s of policy as other
statutes, and with neither more nor
less rigor. Further misunderstanding,
he said, is brought about by persistent
misrepresentation on the part of propa
gandists, who are opposed to the com
petitive principle, and who attempt
to create in the public mind inlftulvlngs
and confusion, both as to the meaning
and ns to thn manner of enforcing
the law embodying it.
FOt'K POINTS TAKK.V I I*
\MTII ATTOII XKV-(iKXKHA I,
"Four points were then taken up."
the statement ef the chamber said.
"First, the complaint that the law is
uncertain.
"Second, the policv of the Depart
ment of Justice as regards the method
of enforcing the law in admittedly
doubtful cases,
"Third, the means adopted b> the'
department to guard against unjust
prosecutions
"Fourth, the policy of the deportment
In eases wher# it and the Federal Trade
< 'oinmlssion are l.oth charged with the
enforcement of the law.
"Concerning the first point, the \t
torney-Ooneral stated that. whilst
eoncededly there is in the law of re
straint of trade vui area of doubt. In
'he vast majority of cases it is not dif
ficult to tell whether a proposed trans
action is or is not in violation of the
statute, and the doubt is certainly no
greater than that which is accepted as
a matter of course in the application of
other laws. Such doubt as there is. lie
further stated, will he greatly reduced
by decisions in the shipping pool case,
the anthracite coal cases, the Harvester
' ?ise. the Steel case and the I'nltcd Shoe
Machinery case, which are now pending
in the Supreme Court."
Questioned as to the policy of the'
department In cases admittedly doubt
ful, or where the pood faith of the men
Involved was not questioned. Attorney-'
Cicneral flregory said In such . case
the department would consider that
' he just and appropriate and quickest'
way of enforcing the law would be by
a <'ivil proceeding^ in which the ques-|
Hon involved would lie contested or a'
consent decree entered, according as the'
defendants desired, or In a notice toj
the parties of t!>^ departments con
clusion. with opportunity, t,? abandon
or modify the transaction. The choice
as between these two procedures would
be determined bv the circumstances of i
the particular case (
"This." tie added, "is the policy off
the department and prosecuting au-j
thorllics generally in the enforcement,
of all laws."
"In this connection." the statement,
