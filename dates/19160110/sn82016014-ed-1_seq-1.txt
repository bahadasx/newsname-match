Constantinople dispatches today by
the Overseas News agency.
The British army at Kut-El-Amara,
in Mesopotamia, has now been sur
rounded completely by the Turks, ac
cording io Constantinople advices giv
en out today by the Overseas News
Agency- It is said the Turks have
advanced to the main defenses of the
British. The main British army in
Mesopotamia, according to these ad
vices, is in retreat, ten thousand men
having been left in Kut-El-Amara to
cover the movement.
Jtecent dispatches have indicated
that the British expedition in Meso
potamia was confronted by Turkish
forces of superior size and that it
would have difficulty in maintaining
itself at Kut-El-Amara. The defenses
of the city, in fact, were attacked by
the Turks some time ago, resulting in
severe fighting but the British were
able to repulse the assaults.

PARSONSTO QUIT
Chief of Police Will Resign at
the Mayor's Request.
He 'Will Be Reappointed at an
Increased Salary.
H. G. Parsons will resign as chief
of police within the next ten days.
His resignation will be asked for by
Mayor J. E. House. Chief Parsons'
successor has not been determined up
on definitely according to Mayor
House but it may be either of two
men now on the police force. An ap
pointment will bo made immediately
upon Parsons' resignation.
But wait, frienas of the chief. Par
sons isn't to be allowed to stray far
from fhe police station. In fact there
is a suspicion that he will continue to
direct the affairs of the police de
partment, although -t will be through
a nominal head. Mayor House will
j ask for Parsons resignation in order
; that a change may be made in the
i salary of the chief of police of Topeka
one that will benefit Chief Parsons.
The mayor thinks the chief of police
should receive $1,800 a year, which is
? 3u 0 a yea r more than Parsons is
receiving. Under the laws it is im
possible to raise the salary of the
chief of police during the term for
wnicn ne was appointea. consequently
Parsons will be asked to resign, the
ne w salary ordinance will be pu
through the commission, carrying
with it an increase for Parsons, then
he will be reappointed- It is the only
way to give him more money. Other
wine the ordinance would not become
effective so far as the chief is con
cerned until Parsons had finished his
service and his successor had been
appointed.
The salary ordinance will be
brought before the city commission
a week from Thursday and some time
between now and then Chief Parsons
will be asked to resign by the mayor.

In one year Kansas counties spent
$607,580.3 for aid or indigent poor
and under the provisions of the moth
ers pension law, according to reports
compiled by Senator J. w. Howe, sec
retary of the state board of control.
The expense is independent of state
and local aid. According to the re
ports received by Senator Howe, 12.871
persons received county benefits.
The Howe report is the first state
ment of the county cost for the care of
the poor. It is also the first statement
showing expenses under the operation
of the mothers' pension law. The an
nual expense to the counties, as re

THEIR JSAD DAY
About 50 Topeka and Atchison
Hunters in the Toils.
State Game Warden Catches
Them Coming and Going.
Sunday was an unlucky dav for
nearly fifty Topeka and Atchison
hunters who were picked up for law
violations by W. G. Tegmire, state
fish and game warden. Tegmire took
a pot shot at the sportsmen during
a trip from Topeka to Atchison and
return and today he reported to Gov
ernor Capper that he had the names
of nearly fifty violators of the state j
law. l
Many of the men arrested, or re- j
ported to Tegmire, were hunting with-
out a license. All may be held for
violating the state law prohibiting
Sunday hunting. When Tegmire
went to the state house today, h had
two pages vt a note book filled with
names of persons to be called on the
carpet in connection with violations
of the state hunting laws.
Tegmire's little run in with the
Shawnee and Atchison county hunters
was really unkind. He didn't think
to send notices that he was coming
and not one sportsman in twenty
knows the state fish and game war
den when he meets him- So it was
all very easy for Tegmire. He merely j
boarded a train going from Topeka
to Atchison. At various towns he mft
hunters carrying guns. A little dili
gence on his part brougiit a list of
twenty names and much honest ex
pression of sentiment. On the return
trip, Tegmire met with equal success.
Today there is a prospect that the
state will proceed against -i number of
men who have violated the Sunday
hunting law. A number of other per-
j sons failed to produce licenses when
requested ny regmire to proauce cre
dentials. Of course, where the license
was presented when requested, Teg
mire was in possession of the name
of the person wanted for Sunday
hunting. And in either event, there is
probably a hot time in store for the
Kansas sportsmen.

DUPONTBLOWS UP
Three Dead, Possibly More, at
Big Powder Plant.
Origin a Mystery ; "Foreign
Agents" Accused.
Philadelphia, Jan. 1 0. Three
men were killed and a number in
jured in an explosion of smoke
less powder early today at the
plant of the Dupont powder works
at Carney's Point, N. J. One man
Is missing. It had been reported
that u large number of men lost
their lives but after an Investiga
tion the superintendent said that
only three were dead and possibly
more.
The cause of the explosion is
not known but according to the
superintendent there is no sus
picion that the blast was due to
outside agencies. The report that
arrests had been made was denied.
The dead are John Walsh,
Nyack Pa. ; Richard J. Lamed,
Philadelphia, and St. Clyde
Wynne, address not known.
The superintendent of the plant
said the victims were employees but
that they had no business in that part
of the works where the explosion oc
curred. The blast was a terrific one and was
felt 25 miles away. Wire communica
tion with the plant was cut off by the
shock, with the result that the wildest
rumors prevailed tfntil daylight
cleared up the extent of the accident.
The property loss is small as the ex
plosion occurred in a small building of
No 1 plant of the works. It was some
distance from the main buildings. One
of the reports in circulation was that
government agents and secret service
men from the Dupont police force had
been watching suspicious persons who
went to the plant from Wilmington
Del., by boat, and tnat two carrying
bombs and fuses, had been arrested.
C. B. Landis, a representative of the
company, branded all these reports as
false.
CIVIL SERVICE EXAM.
The First to Be Held V'nder the New
State Law.
Tomorrow for the first time since
the passage of the state civil service
law, state civil service examinations
will be held simultaneously in a num
ber of places throughout the state.
The tests will be to create an eligible
list for positions under the direction of
the state board of control.
Under the plan to be used, the
heads of state institutions are desig
nated as sub-examiners and over these
is a head examiner to be located at a
central point and to be consulted by
telephone should the sub-examiner be
in doubt about any part of the ex
aminations. W- Y. Morgan, lieutenant
governor, Harry C. Bowman, a mem
ber of the state board of control, and
Dr. T. C. Biddle, superintendent of the
Topeka state hospital, , comprise the
board that will have charge of tomor
row's examinations.
It has been announced that the civil
service regulations hold, with regard
to institutions under the direction of
the state board of control, that em
ployees holding positions July 1, last,
need not take examinations tomorrow.

charge of killing W. H. Smith, cash
ier of the Woodmen of the World, the
night of October 16. He was arrest
ed at Indianapolis on suspicion of
crimes committed in Wichita, Kan.,

The bandit stopped them on the
street. and because Smith was slow in
holding up his hands, shot him dead.

UGH! IT IS COLD
State Capitol of Kansas Is
Wholly Without Steam.
Pipes From the Heating Plant
Out of Commission.' ';
' With a cold . wave and midwinter
weather on the way, the state house
today is as cold as a Greenland bunga
low with the janitor on a strikp.
Nearly 400 feet of pipe leading from
the state heating plant to the state
house, fell this morning and it may
be a week before state ot ficials can
attend to business matters with any
degree of comfort.
When the heat pipes went out of
commission today, there was a hurry
up call for foot warmers and the hard
ware stores were rummaged for oil
stoves. For several hours the lighting
system was also out of commission
and oil lamps and tallow candles were
in the offices and corridors of the
building. Shortly before noon light
service was restored, but the arctla
temperature of the building was not
materially relieved.
In offices today, dignified state of
ficials and department heads r
wearing overcoats and gloves in an ef
fort to keep warm. Dimpled steno
graphers are wearing winter mraps
and wishing they had worn high col
lar shirt waists instead of the fluffy,
low cuts and highly ventilated things
that refuse to shed the chill of a cold
office. With cramped fingers they ara
making a real effort to manipulate
their typewriters but it is a slow pro
cess and not entirely successful.
And that Is not all. I
Several big conventions are com
ing to Topeka this week and represen
tative hall was arranged for the meet
ing of the state agricultural society.
The stork breeders' association is alea
here and a civil service examination la
scheduled. An extra shipment of foot
warmers will be received this after
noon, but the agriculturists will miss
few of the joys of feeding cattle in tha
winter time when they discuss farm
problems in representative hall.
The break down in the state housa
heating system Is the third in lei
than a year. Last fall the state of
ficials and employees shivered for a
month while a new boiler was Install
ed. The state had forgotten about
the need of new boilers during tha
summer months or possibly thara
wasn't any money available. On an
other occasion, the plant was closed
while tne heat tunnels were repaired.
It was explained today that the big
heat pipes are suspended from th
roof of the heat tunnels by chains. One
of the chains broke today and then
other chains gave way. In a few min
utes nearly 400 feet of heat pipe was
out of commission.
