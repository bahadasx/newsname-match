ACQUITTED
Jury Disagrees on Five Indicted
Directors
TRIAL IN PROGRESS 3 MONTHS
Government Charged Officials with
Criminal Violation of Sherman
Anti-Trust Law.
New Y'ork, Jan. 10. Six of tho 11
former directors of the New York,
New Haven and Hartford railroad,
charged by the government with crim
inal violation of the Sherman anti
trust law, were found not guilty late
yesterday by the jury, which, for
nearly three months has been trying
the ease. The jury disagreed on tho
others.
Those acquitted were, 1). Newton
Barney of Farmington, Ct., Robert
W. Taft of Providence, H. I., James
S. Hemingway, A. Heaton Robert
son and Frederick V. Brewster of
New Haven, and Henry K. Mc.IIarg
of Stamford, Ct. Those on whom the
jury disagreed were, William Rocke
feller of New Y'ork. Charles F.
Brooker of Ansonit, Ct.; Charles M.
Pratt of Brooklyn; Lewis Cass Led
yard of New Y'ork. and Edward D.
Bobbins of New Haven, Ct.
The verdict was returned at 4.30
o'clock yesterday afternoon, after
51 hours of deliberation, and the
jury was discharged.
The final vote on the five defend
ants upon whom tho jurors could not
agree stood 8 to 4 for acquittal. R.
L. Baits, chief counsel for the gov
ernment, announced that in due time
he would move for a new trial of
these five. This will be done, he
said, before any effort will be made
to try- the six other former direc
tois of the road who were Indicted,
but who obtained the right to be tried
t-tparately. -.- - - . - -
While they had discussed all the
principal phases of the case, the jur
ors nald. the chief issues of debate
were the matter of the alleged sup
presfion by the New Haven of the
competition of the Joy steamship line
and the acquisition of tho Boston and
Maine railroad by which the govern
ment charged the New Haven com
pleted its monopoly of the transporta
tion trnfite of New England. The so-
called Lilian! transactions were vir
tually ignored, the jurors said, having
in the opinion of most of them, been
ruled out by the charge of Judge
Hunt. There was also comparatively
little discussion on the Metropolitan
steamship deal, the question being
whether it was a private transaction
cf Robbins' or a point transaction of
all the New Haven directors The
Grand Trunk was also not a perti
nent issue, it. was said. The jurors
explained that they had sought to fol
low tho instructions of the court in
his charge that they should decide
first whether the alleged conspiracy
of which the defendants were accused
was in existence in 1890, when the
government charged it began, and
was continuous down to tho date of
the indictment. They reached no
agreement on this question, they said.
Apparently, for the purposes of .de
bate, the jurors assumed that such a
conspiracy existed and then took up
the different phases. The participa
tion of one of the defendants in the
New Haven's effort to prevent the
sale of two steamboats to the Joy line
was a subject, it was said, of sharp
debate.

W. W. Bartlett Discusses Present
Day Tendencies in Education
TWO SPEAKERS AT FORTNICHLY
Intersting Paper by Miss Mary
Benedict on "Following the Lead
of the Child."
At the Fortnightly on Saturday af
ternoon the program was devoted, to
educational subjects presented by t war
speakers.
Miss Mary L. Benedict of the Sun
day School Institute read a paper bu
."Following the Lead oC the Child,"
which contained many suggestions in.
regard to awakening the young
child's mind to the great . truths of
life and pointing the way to a nobler
and more complete maturity. Only
through understanding the child
thought, and the necessity of follow
ing this in a natural sequence of de
velopment could a full knowledge of
the possible growth be realized. Miss
Benedict has taught for several years
and spoke with a broad understand
ing of her subject.
Willard W. Bartlett. -who won his
M. A. at Columbia university, by spec
ializing In educational work, was a
most interesting speaker and his sub
ject, "Present Day Tendencies in
Education," was one on which he
could speak from a practical view
poInL His personal knowledge' of the
unfitness of many college graduates
to solve the commonest problems of
everyday life, was a reason for many
original ideas in regard to what con
stitutes real education. That the
man who cannot cope with the diffi
culties surrounding him is not edu
cated in the true sense of the word,
no matter what his book knowledge
may be, is bound to be the foundation
of the broader teaching of the future.
Its beginning now, in the introduc
tion of manual training In many
branches of school work, points ..the .
way to greater and truer development
in the future.
Mr. Bartlett Illustrated his talk
with many pertinent stories of actual
experiences in his own branches of
work and investigation. As a whole
they made his theory a most reason-,
able conclusion, and Just at this time,
when methods of education are en
gaging the attention of so many of
our older scholars, who have come to
see the inefficiency of the methods in
vouge for the past thirty years, it Is
most interesting to hear the views of
the young student who is forming his
opinions from present day experience.
The program was in charge of the
education committee. Miss Hilda
Pratt, chairman, and was opened
with songs by a group of children
from grade one, in charge of two pri--niary
teachers, Miss Gertrude Carney
and Miss Christine Bennett. The
children also gave a folk dance to
the accompaniment of Y'lctrola mu
sic. This part of the program was
very appealing to all, and showed the
value of such recreation work in the
happy faces and joyous spirit of tho
children.
The next Fortnightly meeting ' at
the Congregational church chapel on
Jan. 22 is called Officers day.' Mrs.
Elizabeth Grinnell Van Patten, of
Burlington will read two short plnys,
"Tho Twelve Pound Look" by Barrio
and "The Open Door," by Sutro, and
there will bo music.
