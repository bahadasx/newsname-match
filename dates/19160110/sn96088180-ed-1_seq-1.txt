RUSE OF SOLDIERS
Paris, Jan. 10. The nearest thing
In this war to the famous Horse of
Troy Is told of in a French soldier's
lottor from a base hospital at the
front. Jt was a wdodon cow In this
case and thereby hangs the story of
how the soldier happened to bo In
hospital. ,
The French tronches at this sol
dier's particular part of the front
were fifty yards from the German
trenches. A harmless old cow re
lieved trench monotony each day by
grazing between the Hues. The
French hd German soldiers finally
came to an understanding that the
opposing lines SuSuld alternately
have the opportunity of milking the
cow and be Immune from attack dur
ing the operation. This went on for
some time, until a French ofllcer sus
pected that the Germans were using
tholr milking time for spying puN
Pobos and ordered the next German
milking party to be firod on, s
The French soldiers thoreupon
built a wooden cow, as near as pos
sible a counterpart of the real one,
and put a machine gun Inside to
awnlt tho German , 'milkmen. The
soldier who relates the etory took his
station insldo the cow and was suc
cessful In slaying throe Germans lis
they approached with milk palls,
Having fulfilled hla mission the sol
dier prepared to slide his wooden cow
hack to the trench, whon he was In
terrupted' by a terrific shock'. v The
cow was smashed to piece's. The sol
dier succoedod in escaping, though

BRITISH SERVICE
. T. M. Ferguson, who recently cams
to the Rogue valley from Seattle, and
who la now making hla home here,
has Just received a letter from his
brother, A. Ferguson, who was with
the Australian imperial forces In the
Dardanelles campaign. The iletter
was written on November 2,1, but did
not reach Seattle till January 6, when
it was forwarded to Mr. Ferguson
hr.- The brother is with a machine
gun Bection, and was landed at Galll
poll" peninsula with the ' British
troops and had been fighting ,tbe
Turks in the campaign prosecuted in
an endeavor to force the Dardanelles.
He says that as all mail is strictly
censored, he can not go into much
detail, but from the tone of his letter
the young soldier seemed to feel
much optimism, though he candidly
admitted that the shells sent over the
trenches by "Abdul" had him "bluff
ed." Hepoke in high praise of the
work of the British fleet, and of the
terrific execution done by their guns
against the Turk hosts. Since the
letter was written however, ,the
British have withdrawn from the
Dardanelles campaign. Mr. Fergu
son has two other brothers on Euro
pean soil, one having been wounded
while with his company in France,
while another, of whom he lias not
heard lately, is somewhere In Bel
gium. . ' v ' .v

Gpy. Strong Makes kzrA
Report to Secretary cf tie
ttericr ca Ccdifcs fa
tie Northern Territory
Washington, Jan. 10. -"Alaska Is
a 'land flowing with milk and honey'
like the promised land of the ancient
Israelites. But the 'milk' must be
sought out and the 'honey' carefully
gathered.'' '
The future and possibilities of the
territory of Alaska are thus ambigu
ously expressed in the annual report
to the secretary of the Interior by
Geo. J. F. A. Strong, made public to
day. - ' : ; :
Tbe roseate word picture painted
by Governor Strong is baaed on solid
facts and figures as to the increased
agricultural activities, greater min
eral output, and the vast coal fields
which await only the coming of the
new government railroad to make
them big factors, in the coal market
Discussing the Alaska coalfields,
the report says: "Teats of the Matan
uska coal for steaminz Dnrooses were
mad- during the "year' nnder the
direction of the navy department, and
the coal was found eminently "satis
factory. This -field, therefore, Bhould
supply .the .government with all the
coal it needs on the Pacific coast,
including Hawaii and the Philippines,
for naval and other purposes."
That the Pacific coast will find a
new market at wch it can pur
chase coke, thus Affording it relief
from the present situation, is indi
cated by the statement that the
Alaska coal fields contain -large quan
tities of coal suitable for coking pur
poses. :-n v.', .... ;'',';
Jhe completion qf ,the govern
ment system of railroads at the ear
liest possible time is a matter of
prime importance to th territory,"
says the report "Many farms are be
ing homesteaded in the vicinity of
the railroad surveys; the prospectors
are abroad on tho hills and in the
valleys of the interior and the coastal
regions. -
As the railroads of the west were
the pioneers of civilization, bo will
the building of the railroads ; in
Alaska cause tbe wilderness and now
waste places to bloom and blossom."
Although "gold" and "Alaska
have been made synonymous almost,
the report states .that "probably the
most conspicuous feature of mining
development in Alaska during the
last year is shown 1n the greatly in
creased production of copper oreB.
"Shipments of copper ore by the
Kennecott Mines company have
reached as much as a million dollars
per month or more, the ore being
anippea 10 -iscoma, vvasn., ror treat
ment." "The vast possibilities of Alaska
industrially, agriculturally and com
mercially Justify the prediction that
within the next decade the potential
greatness of this territory as a pro
ducer of natural wealth will have be
come 8o flrmly established as to dis
pel the last lingering doubts of those
who have assumed the expressed or
implied attitude of scoffers when
Alaska has been under discussion,"
says the report in conclusion. 1
