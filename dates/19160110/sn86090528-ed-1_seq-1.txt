The frequency with which the in

ity is an interesting feature of the re
port. An average increase of 2.5 per
cent in local advertising throughout
the country Isdisclosed. Retailers in
creased the stocks they are carrying
4. XI per cent.

owners, Uurdwaro dealers, clothiers
and druggists represent the six lines

everywhere In the United States and
the average Increase over 1914 In
business was shown to have been
15.93 per cent, Business conditions as
compared to those following the out
break of tho European war were de
cidedly improved.
Collections also were better, the av
erage for the whole year being 5.8
above normal, as compared with 1914.
Tho point system of scoring collec
tions, as used in the, report, consists
of assigning 40 points for a report of
poor collections, 60 points for a report
of normal collections, and 80 points
tor a report of good conditions.
The following table shows average
percentages of increase In sales, ad
vertising and collections; the figures

bankers and retailers to plan their
business campaigns for 1916 more ef
fectively. It Is pointed out that re
tailers, by comparing the figures iu
the report with their own sales, collec
tions and stocks, will be able to deter

CAR CUTS
ODD CAPER
ON STREET
Turns Turtle on Chickasha Avenue When
Driver Suddenly Swerves in Effort
t to Pass Pedestrians; Deputy
Court Clerk is Injured
A peculiar accident occurred early
this morning when, while Jack Cra
vens was driving down Chickasha ave
nue, his car turned turtle as he
ewervd sharply in an effort to pass
a pedestrian.
j Mrs. Edna T. Watkins, deputy court
j clerk, who was crossing the street, re
ceived a blow which rendered her
helpless and she was carried immedi
ately to the Chickasha hospital.
The accident happened near the
corner of Sixth and Chickasha avenge.
Mr. Cravens said he was going about
fifteen miles an hour when Mrs. WTat
lcins loomed up ahead of him. Then
came one of the confusing moments
which often occur in such cases ia
the dodging game, neither being able
to guess what the other is going to
do. Seeing that an accident was in
evitable unless he made a quick turn,
Mr. Cravens gave the steering wheel
a sudden jerk which carried the car
to the street railway track and sud
denly turned it over. At the moment
when the car swerved, Mrs. Watkins
had started the same way and the
machine struck her. Mrs. Cravens
was in the front seat with her hus
band. The w ind shield of the car was shat
tered, the lights broken and the front
end jammed in, but the engine was
ready for business as soon as the ma
chine was righted. When the crash
came Mr. Cravens landed by the side
of the car, receiving no injury of con
sequence. At the hospital it w-as discovered
that the injuries of Mrs. Watkins were
not of a serious nature, being con
fined to a few bruises, some of which
were on her face, where she came iu
contact with the paving. Unless there
are oinforeseen developments, it is
thought that she will be entirely re
covered within a few days.

FORD PARTY
PRESS PUSH
PUNISHED
By United Press.
THE HAGUE, Jan. 10. Because the
representatives of the press accom

been naughty, they are being punished.
The hotels at The Hague being full,
fifty newspaper correspondents who
are members of the expedition are
quartered in a Dutch sanitarium.
No guest in the sanitarium is al
lowed to use tobacco or liquor. There
is no meat on the bill of fare which
consists largely of nuts, cereals and
queer vegetables. The guards threaten
to oust any correspondents who fail
to observe the regulations.
A vote among the press portion of
the party shows the concensus of opin
ion to be that Madame Schwimmer,
who made the advance arrangements
here for the party, sent the corre
spondents to the sanitarium in re
venge for their reporting the rows
among the delegates.
Public peace meetings being barred
here, a meeting under the auspices of
the Royal Zoological and Botanical
Society is being arranged by the peace
societies.

WOMAN ON
TRIAL FOR
MURDER
Mrs. Mohr, Wealthy Widow of Prominent
Physician, Faces Court on Charge of
Complicity in Killing of
Husband
MYSTERIOUSLY SHOT
WHEN AUTO STOPPED
Young Woman in Car Who Also Wounded;
Negro Chauffeur Makes Confession;
Alleged Plot to Kill Doctor;
Grand Jury Indicts
By United Press.
PROVIDENCE, R. I., Jan. 10. Mrs.
C. Franklin Mohr and three alleged
negro accomplices were to oe placed
on trial in superior court here today
on the charge of murdering Dr. C.
Franklin Mohr as he rode with a
young woman in his automobile, past
a lonely spot near Wyatt, R. I., on
the night of August 13, 1913.
The Mohr family is wealthy and so
cially prominent in the summer colo
nies hereabout. Dr. Mohr of Provi
dence, well known in Newport and
New York, was murdered about 9
o'clock. He was shot in the head and
right shoulder and died at the Rhode
Island hospital a few hours later.
With Dr. Mohr at the time of the
murder was Miss Emily G. Burger,
young and pretty, for several yeara
his housekeeper. She also was shot
in the head and right shoulder. She
recovered. Dr. Mohr and Miss Burger
were on their way to Dr. Mohr's New
port home. Their machine was oper
ated by George W. Healis, a negro,
who had been in the employ -of the
doctor a short time. Healis called for
help and gave the police the first story
of the crime.
During her ride to the hospital, Miss
Burger told all she could remember of
the shooting. She said that soou
after the car left Providence, Healis
complained that the motor was work
ing badly. When the car reached the
top of the hill, at the bottom of which
the crime was committed, she thought
Healis flashed the lights. He stopped
the machine in a spot overhung by
trees. according to Miss Burger, got
out and lifted the hood. Then, she
said, there was a crackling in the
underbrush followed by flashes and
revolver shots. The doctor stood up,
half turned and fell across the back
of the machine. She tried to get out
of the car. There were more flashes
and then she knew no more until just
before she was lifted into the ambu
lance. Healis denied flashing his lights.
He said he stopped at the bottom of
the incline to adjust his carburetor.
He said he heard no noise prior to the
revolver shots and did not see the
person or persons who fired them.
The negro chauffeur next morning at
Providence, after many hours' grilling,
is said to have confessed to having
knowledge of a plot to rob Dr. Mohr,
who, he said, was known to be carry
ing considerable money.
Healis is said to have implicated
another negro, Cecil Victor Brown,
who had been discharged from Dr.
Mohr's employ three weeks before.
Healis said that he was not in the
plot. All he was supposed to do, he
is said to have said, was to stop the
car when Brown held it up between
Wyatt and West Harrington. He, it is
said, said Brown was to trait the Mohr
auto on his motorcycle, which Mrt.
Mohr is said to have purchased for
Brown. Brown was arrested at the
house of George Daley on Sarle street.
Brown denied that he knew anything
about the crime and said he could
prove an alibi. He said the reason for
his discharge by Dr. Mohr was that he
had held a two-minute conversation
with Mrs. Mohr in the barn of the
Newport estate. In Dr. Mohr's pockets
after the murder, were found two
blcod-stained envelopes addressed to
Brown and containing pleas for au
immediate interview with him. They
were written in a woman's hand and
signed with a woman's name. These
letters, it developed later, were Inter
cepted at the Mohr home and given to
Dr. Mohr. Brown denied ever having
received notes from Mrs. Mohr
through her son. After an all-night
