PROVIDENCE. K. I., Jan. lb
Reflecting e-omphicently that, of the
More or innre women accused of
murder in the last decude; only three
liiie been comicted and only one of
those executed. Mis. Elizabeth Fran
ces Mhr was smiling and hupeful
today as she faced Justice Charles
F. Stearns in the superior court.
This highly-strung and nerve-racked
woman defendant was charged with
being an at -cessory b fore the "art in
procuring the murder, on the Wash
ington road last August of her
husband. Dr. O. Franklin Mohr, phy
sician to the society colonies of
Pro idem e and Newport.
"I never was inure confident of
anything than I am ri-'ht "now of
acquittal." said Mrs. Möhr, through
her personal counsel, Arthur Cush
intf. "Ami I mean not acquittal
alone but vindication as well. This
charge a'ain-t me is absurd."
Tun n-IefriuIaut-.
Facing the court today as co
defendants with Mrs. -Möhr were
'ecil Victor I'.rown and Henry
Spellman, negroes who arc accused
f tiring the shot that killed Ir.
Möhr and seriously wounded Miss
F.mily IJurker. his cflice assistant.
who was riding with the physician
in his automobilo at the time.
George W. Heali.-, the third
neKro arrested, who "us l)r. Mohr's
hauffeur on the fatal ride, will be a
witness for the prosecution. Healis,
who. at the outset, declared that he
was hired by Mrs. Möhr to stop the
ar at the dark wooded spot on the
lonely Washington rad, was permit
ted on Friday to enter a nolle con
tend re. amounting to a pica of guilty.
'er.tence was deferred until after
Mrs Mohr's trial.
Asst. Atty. ('.en. Abbott Phillips is
in charge of the prosecution.
"I can s?e no po.'; ilulity but a
conviction." Phillips said. "We
liave the obvious motive for the kill
ing jealousy. So far as has been
"brought forward, nohody had any
desire for Mohr's death bin his wife.
Certainly nobody but Mrs. Möhr
could, have a grudge against Miss
3Iurger."

WASHINGTON, Jan. 10. Consul
Keblinger at Malta, cabled the state
department today that he had ob
tained affidavits from several sur
vivors of the Persia, including one
from Lord Montagu. He stated that
he is forwarding them by mail. All
agreed, he said, that the Persia was
sunk without warning and that the
officers of the Persia kept a look
out for submarines all the way
through the Mediterranean.
WASHINGTON'. Jan. 10. The ad
ministration will make further con
cessions to congress in its interna
tional policy. Satisfied that in view
of the efforts made by Germany and
Austria to meet this government's
views on submarine warfare little
further apprehension need be felt on
that score the president today was
busily compiling an outline of a
general trade policy.
It will apply to all countries, but
naturally will affect under existing
circumstances only England and
France. It marks, officials say. an
earnest effort on the t.art -f ti,
president to meet the views of the
senatorial delegation led by Sen.
Hoke Smith of Georgia, who have
presented statistics to show that
Pritish illegality was strangling
American trade.
The president also is expected to
reply to Ambassador von Pernstorffs
latest Lusitania note without any
further delay. State department
and embassy officials expect him to
accept the suggested settlement. In
principle it has been approved by
Sec'y Ii n sing.
The only thing hanging !iro is the
phraseology of the note. As the
document submitted by the ambass
ador is informal it can be changed
if the president so desires without
jeopardizing final settlement. And
otlicials say that Germany has met
this government far more than half
way in its contentions.
So far as the Persia sinking was
concerned there have been no new
developments. Ambassador Penlield
.tili is waitincr word from the Aus
trian admiralty. Put officials say
that they are now convinced that the
sinking of the liner with the loss
of two American lives probably never
will be fully explained. Put that
this incident of the war no longer
is considered a serious menace to
the Cnited States is best indicated
by the tacit agreement on the part
of the administration leaders that
no further effort will he n.ade to
gag con-res in discussing the in
ternational situation.

Comptroller Williams in An
nual Report Continues His
Fight on Banks' Usur
ious Rates.
TWELVE PERCENT WAS
CHARGED IN NEW YORK
Many Suggestions Offered to
Prevent Institutions From
Being Broken From
the Inside.
Irtcri'.aMonal New Service:
WASHINGTON'. Jan. 10. The
climax to the campaign against the
charging' alleged usurious rates of
interest by American national banks
which has been prosecuted by John
Skelton Willian: comptroller of the
turnncy, came today when Comp
troller Williams submitted to the
house of representatives his annual
repoU, in which he rates by na
tional banks and urges upon con
grcs? drastic measures to punish of
fenders. lie says:
"Usury unchecked means depopu
lation, hopelessness, thriftlessm ss
and resulting loss of producing ca
pacity. "If there should be an amend
ment," the comptroller adds "to the
national bank act authorizing and
dire.-tirrg the department of justice
to bring suit against usurers upon
information furnu-hed either
through the comptroller of the cur
rency or through other sources, the
practice of usury in all the national
banks throughout the country can
be stopped. 1 inert fore earnestly
recommend to the present congress
the passage of such a law."
Charged 12 Percent.
The comptroller's report states
that on the outbreak of the Euro
pean war New York banks increased
their normal intcreü: rates to as
high as 12 percent in some cases.
Through a threat to publish a list of
names of New York banks not
charging usurious rates' Comptrol
ler Williams says he Micceeded in
forcing the banks to reduce their
charges to six percent.
Taking up the campaign among
the country banks, the comptroller
publishes long tables of rates charg
ed in which he shows that rates as
high as 200 percent were exacted by
some banks. Many of these high
rates, the comptroller concedes,
were charged on small loans for
short periods but he cites the in
stances of three Okal ihoma banks,
which, he declares, show average
rates' of interest charged on all
tables comptroller refrains from
giving the names of the banks.
Makes Recommendations.
Comptroller Williams recom
mends" to congress, i:i his report,
much legislation designs to prevent
banks' from being "broken from the
inside." Among these recommen
dations are the following:
Prohibit officers from borrowing
from their own banks and prohibit
directors from borrowing .except on
authority of the directorate.
Require otfieers and employes to
give surety bonds.
Limit the amount of a bank's
money which may b.? lent to one
firm, corporation or individual.
Prevent or limit payment of over

International News Service:

known among church folk of Juliet
as Miss Lillian Ogden Piper, fired a
bullet into her brain today and died
in the office of John II. Robart, a
young man who had been seen much
in her company lately, after she had
wounded Robart. The girl left a
note requesting that news of her
death be sent to her father, William
Ogden, of Richmond, Ya.
The girl was waiting in Robart's
ollice when he arrived this morning.
"I'm through with you. 1 don't

to his visitor. Then he turned his diers have been killed or wounded, i elles will go into the Palkar.s.

The girl is believed here to have
been the foster daughter of a Vir

here, she had posed for some time as
Robart's wife. Lately he had been
paying attentions to another young
woman.
The Piper girl failed, if her intent
was to kill Robart. Surgeons at th;
hospital to which he was removed,
said that the wound in his neck was
not sulf'uient to cause death.

was the first taller at the hospital.
She admitted that Robart form rly

LONDON, Jan. D Mine sweep
ing operations on a vast scale have
been inaugurated since the destruc
tion of te Rritish battleship King
Kdwaid VII.. presumably by a mine
planted by a German submarine.
Although all the members of th
ship's crew, 77 7 men. were .ied,
the loss of the King IMward VII. is
a serious blow t the Pritish f!eet
for it was one of the finest of the
last cla.vs -of predreadnaughts.
Since the German IT boats gave
up their campaign of destruction
ngainst mercantile shipping evidence
hns developed that many of thrc
under-water boats have been equip
ped for mine laying purposes and
are earning on this work in the
most unexpected places around th
Pritish isles.
The King IMward VII. was the
22nd important warship lot by L'ng
land sinee the war began.
The loss of the battleship coming
at the same time as the announce
ment that the allied f..rc-s have
completely evacuated the Gailipoll
peninsula caused gloom, but govern
ment leaders, referring to the obi
adage "it's an ill wind that blows
no good." believe that this disastrous
news will have a good effect on re
cruiting and further allay opposi
tion to conscription.
