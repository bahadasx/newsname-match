President's Friends Uneasy Over Atti
tude of Nebraskan.
Washington, Jan. 1'0.—William Jen
nings Bryan has filled the thick and
thin supporters of the administration
with a new spasm of wrath because
he.. is telling his own thick and thin
supporters that he proposes to live up
to the one-term plank in the demo
cratic national platform.' W-hat this
may mean the upholders of the presi
dent d» not clearly underatand, but
they are convinced beyond question
that the Nebraskan means trouble and
lots of It.
In the corridors and cloakrooms of
the capltol one can hear almost cpn
stant discussion of Bryan. Two !.or
away. Wire communication .with the X™^
plant was cut off. with, the result that
three democrate
standing aloof and
shaking their heads generally means
Bryan. If you pass within earshot ypu
catch the solemn remark, "Bryan is
making a great mistake." The phrase
covers the opinion of those," and all of
them, who do not want any trouble in
the democratic party. And, of course
those who are in office do not' want
thai kind of trouble. j•
It is not yet claimed by tuiybody
here -that Bryan will be a' candidate
for the presidential nomination. Yet
when the word comes that he proposes
to see that the one-fterm plank is en
forced they take him at his word. They
believe he means what fre says, and
they conjure up all sorts of trouble that
Bryan is capable of making for the
faithful "Ins" who want to remain in.
Probably the muiti common Interpre
tation of Bryan's declaration,is thjit
he means to kick up a-roW in the dem
ocratic national convention in case that
body proceeds to ignore the one-term
plaiik and renominate the president. As
a kicker up of rows in (^national con
venrtlon they all have hlgh respect for
Aryan, no matter what other opinion
of him may be -entertained.
Alt an indication that Bryan will .not
hesitate to trip up the prortdent it n»ay

Minneapolis, Jan. 10.—With the defi

national politlca lsituatlon has cleared

Comptroller's Report Shows
Unprecedented Financial
Power.
RESERVE OF BANKS
REACHES NEW RECORD
Legislation Asked to Authorize Depart
ment of Justioe to Institute Suits
Against Usurers—Borrowing of Of
ficers From Own Banka Is Recom
mended Comptroller Again Seeks
Authority to Remove Directors,
Washington, Jan. 10.—"Development
and growth never paralleled ln the
financial history of any country," is
the way John Skelton Williams, comp
troller of the currency, describes in his
annual report to congress, the opera
tion of the national banks under his
charge, during the period from Octo
ber, 1914, to November, 1915, the first
year under the federal reserve, sys
tem. The report was today presented
to congress.
Mr. Williams gives a comparative
statement of the condition of the na
tional banks to back up his statement.
He shows that net resources of the
banks increased ln the year $1,743,
878,648, that deposits Increased $2,081,
53p,164 and that loans and discounts
increased $917,450,502. Available cash
Incr^&fced in the same period $862,000,
000 and on! Nov. 10, 1915, the report
ing national banks had excess reserves
of $891,040,000. Tables show the com
parative condition of banks ln 1895 and
1915. In September, 1895, there were
3,712 reporting banks with net deposits
of $1,989,300,000, and loans and dis
counts of $2,059,408,402, while In No
vember, 1915, there were 7,617 report?
ing banks with net deposits of $9,079,
471,447, and loans and discounts of
$7,233,928,973.'
Greatest Reserve Ever Held.
-'The reserves held by the national
banks,- Nov. 10, 1915," says the report,
"exceeded $587,000,000, the greatest re
serves ever: held at any time prior to
"th»j(Msage-of the federal reserve act.
I^oans^arid discounts amounted to
dia
*ounti?©f 'airSflSiksr^ndnuain g.' nationfflfc
state, sayings arid private banks and
loan arid trust companies—as late as
the year 1962."
Mr. Williams says that the "banking
power" of the United States—the capital1
surplus, circulation deposits, etc.—of.
all reporting banks, national and oth
erwlse with an estimate of the figures
for non-reporting banks, amounted in
June, 1915, to $25,397,100,000, an in
crease in a year of about $1,057,100,000.
Savings bank depositors increased by
176,256 during the year ending last
June, with total deposits of $4,997,706,
013, an Increase of $61,114,163. The
average deposit, however, decreased
from $444.36 to $442.83, while the num
ber of banks Increased from 2,100 to
2,159.
To Stamp Out Usury.
The comptroller's principal recom
mendation for legislation Is for an
amendment against usurers upon In
formation furnished either by the
comptroller or thru other sources.
Other recommendations given under
a heading, "To Prevent Bank Fail
ures," propose: To prohibit officers
from borrowing from their own banks:
to prevent loans to directors except
with the approval of the board: to re
quire officers and employes .to give
surety bonds to limit direct and in
direct loans to one individual, firm or
corporation to prevent or limit over
drafts to require certificates of de
posit. to be signed by two directors to
prevent erasures on the books of a
bank to-limit Interest paid on de
posits to authorize the establishment
of branches in the United States to
•permit branches ln Alaska and Insular
possessions to authorize minimum in
terest charges—which ordinarily might
bb usurious—on small loans and to
authorize th'e Comptroller to bring pro
ceedings against directors for losses
sustained by a bank thru violation, of
the bank act.
Removal Power Is Sought.
The report renews the comptroller's
recommendations of last year for other
legislation, including the giving of au
thority to the comptroller to remove
directors guilty of persistent violations
of the bank act.
Banks," says Mr. Williams, "nearly
always are broken, not by bank rob
bers, who have come from the outside,
not by failure of customers to whom
'they have lent money, but by the tying
up or dissipation of the banks' funds
thru loans to their own officers and
directors, or else by direct defalcations
and embezzlements by trusted officers.
If these evils are remedied—and they
can be remcidied if certain simple and
much needed amendments can be se
Oured to urn national uouk act—fail
ures among national banks can be re
duced to a negligible number, or be iab
solutely eliminated."
Mr. Williams ahows there were four
teen failures during the tweive months
ended Oct. 31. Ift the last fifty years
he says, there Weife 208 failures attrib
utable to criminal acts, while Injudi
cious or careless banking were respon
sible for 136 others.
