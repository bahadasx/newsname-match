WASHINGTON, D. G, Jan. 10.
'"Development and i growth

ifcial history of any country," Is the
1 way John Skelton "Williams, controler
' the currency, describes in his an
nual report to congress, the operation
of the national banks under his charge,
dur.ng the period from October, 1914,
to November, 1915, the first year un
der the Federal reserve system. The
report was today presented to con
gress.
Mr Williams gives a comparative
statement of the condition of the na
tloaa! banks to back up his statement.
He shows that net resources of the
banks increased in the year $1,742,878,
48. that deposits increased $2,081,530,
164 and that loans and discounts in
creased $917,450,502. Available cash in

The reserves held ly the national
hanks November 10. 1915," says the re
port, "exceeded by $587,000,000 the
greatest r&erves ever held at any time
prior to the passage of the Federal
Reserve act. Loans and discounts
amounted to more than the total loans
and discounts of all banks, including
national state, savings and private
tanks and loan and trust companies
as late as the jear 1992."
, Mr Williams says that the 'banking
power" of the United States the cap
ita' surplus, circulation deposits, etc
of all reporting banks, national and
otherwise with an estimate of the fig
ures for non-reporting banks, amount
ed in June 1915. to $25,397,100,000, an
increase In a year of about $1,967,100,
000. Savings bank depositors increased
bv 7S.:56 doring the year ending last
June with total deposits of $4,997,706.

erage deposit, however, decreased from
$444 36 to S44ES8 while the number
of banks increased from 2100 to 2159.
To Protect Depositor.
The rontroler's principal recommend
ation for legislation Is for an amend
ment to the bank law authorizing and
dire-ting the department of justice to
brirg suits against usurers upon in
formation furnished either by the con;
troler or through other sources.
Other recommendations given under
a heading to prevent bank failures
propose: To prohibit officers from
borrowing from their own banks; to
prevent loans to directors except with
the approval of the board; to require
pfficrs and employes to give surety
bonds; to limit direct and Indirect loans
to one individual, firm or corporation;
to prevent or limit overdrafts; to re
quire certificates of deposit to be
signed by two directors; to prevent
erasures on the books of a bank; to
limit interest paid on deposits; to au
thorize the establishment of branches
In the United States; to permit branch
es in Alaska and Insular possessions;
to authorize minimum interest charges
which ordinarily might be usurious
on small loans and to authorize the

POIER BLAST
Philadelphia, Pa.. Jan. 10. Three
men were killed and a number injured
in an explosion of smokeless powder
early this morning at the plant of the
Du Pont Powder works at Carney's
Point. N. J.
The cause of the explosion is not
known but, according to the superin
tendent, there is no suspicion that the
blast was due to outside agencies. The
report that arrests had be.en made was
denied.
The superintendent of the plant said
the victims were employes but that
they had no business In that part of
the works where the explosion oc
curred. The blast was a terrific one
and was felt 25 miles away. Wire com
munication with the plant was cut off
by the shock, with the result that the
wildest rumors prevailed until day
light cleared up the extent of the accident-

CONTESTS
HI'S CLAIM:
Says Husband, Gen. Moussy
and Not "Viscount of
Ypres," Saved Ypres..
Paris, France. Jan. 10. Field mar
shal Sir John French who. after his el
evation to the peerage assumed the title
of viscount of Ypres. Is encountering
vigorous opposition from the widow of
the late Gen. Moussy. of the French
army. She contends that her husband,
not the British general, saved the day
for the Allies at Ypres, November 6,
1914.
The widow asserts the facts that
Gen. Moussy. commanding the 33d bri
gade of French infantry, by the des
perate resistance of his detachment,
sent to Zeillebeke on October II to the
relief of the British at Ypres. and by
his stoical, calm and tenacious attitude,
reassured the British, who regained
confidence, thus arresting the German
advance and preventing the Germans
from reaching Calais by his decisive
intervention.
Again, the general's widow says that
It was on December 6 at the head of a
little troop of about 250 men of all
arms, got together by Gen. Moussy's
staff, that the general charged when
the Germans' attempt to pierce the
line at Ypres was made, routed two
Bavarian reirlments. and in the end
saved Ypres by capturing hill No. 60.
between Sewartelen and Zllllbeke. thus
rendering the inarch on Calais impos
sible. In further support of her claim in
behalf of her late husband, the widow
ciuotes a letter to Gen. Moussy fr"
Gen. Haig, dated January 2, 1915,
thanking Gen Moussy for the conduct
of his troops at Ypres and adding:
"It was a very critical moment, and
It was this touching cmaraderie which
assured the allies success."
