SAGE OF JOINER CITY SAYS
HAT IS IN THE RING AND
HIS
HE
WILL BE THERE WITH BELLS
ON WHEN CAMPAIGN STARTS.
Have you heard the rumbling noises
from the vicinity of Joiner City? No,
it is not the escaping gas from e:
other big "Gasser," but the booming
clarion voice of Uncle V. T. Wise
man who is proclaiming In thunder
ous tones that be has his "lid" in the
ring, and is going to make the race
for county treasurer of Carter countv.
state or Oklahoma. This little re
minder is going to inject some ginger
in a race that every one thought would
he a one-man affair. The "Squire" who
is one of those Tennesseans who make
politics by moonlight, has been a resi
dent of what is now Carter County
for a number of years, and ever since
the dawn of statehood, lias held the
office of Justice of the peace of his pre
cinct. He is a campaigner who is not
afraid to invade the precincts of the
enemy, he seldom comes out second
best in any sort of an argument, re
ligious or political, and when he rises
to address a few brief remarks, the
audience begins to sit up and take
stock of the rustic orator who can
point a moral or adorn a tale.
The "Squire" has been a war horse
in Carter County politics ever since
the 4(ith star was added to the galaxy
of states. When the party was in peril
of defeat, he would take off his coat,
call to the boys from the forks of the
creek to follow his lead, and soon the
socialist banner that flaunts more or
less regularly in his neighborhood
would be trailing In the dust. With his
entrance into me campaign some sure
enough campaigning will be done, and
J tliis race will probably develop into
one of the most Interesting of any in
the county.

There is quite a difference between
flfteeen or eighteen thousand dollars
and se enty-llvo pieces of that de

zons' committee awarded one claim-
ant against the Santa Fe. Railroad
company for personal injury damage--1

The committee has had ih' case
under advisement for several davs, I
and after hearing all I he NvOii'iny
in the case, decided that sevnty-tlve
dollars was about the r'ght award
to make, although the np'iHeui'.t for
damages had estimated various esti
mated various amounts from fifteen
to eighteen thousand dollars.
The committee finished all cases
pending until the 25th of 1 he month
and adjourned until that time Satur
day afternoon. The claim agents of
the railway are in the 'city and are
rapidly disposing of all remaining
cases. It Is estimated that the citi

January 25.
Up to date, tiie Santa Fe has paid
out nearly one milium dollars, which
does not include its own losses. All
this has been done without, litigation,
which has established a precedent un
heard of in t he annals of railroading.
The citizens' committee has remained
steadfast In its determination to see
fair play throughout all the matter,
and one who lias left his case in tin
hands of this committee has just
cause for complaint. .

LORD BURNHAM, PROPRIETOR OF
OLD LONDON PAPER, ANSWERS
FINAL ROLL CALL ONE OF
OLD SCHOOL.
London, Jan. 10. Uird Burnhain
died here Sunday afternoon after a
prolonged illness.
Lord Buniham, the proprietor of
tiie Daily Telegraph, was I lie last of
the old school of London newsnaner
owners. Through his working years,
irom young manliooil to an older age
than most men remain in harness,
lie controlled the business affairs and
the editorial policies of that paper.
He made it one of the greatest prop
erties among newspapers, as well as a
great paper from the news stand
point. Horn Edward Levy, on Decem
ber 28, is:;:i, oldest of a family of
tight children of J. M. Levy, lie as
sumed, in 1S75, the surname of his
uncle, Lionel Law son, and was Kd
ward Levy-Iiwson. On October IS,
.1S92, he was created a baronet, and
on July 31, 1903, was raised to the
peerage as Baron Burnhaii). His title
was taken from the Hundred of
Burnham, Bucks, which contains most
of the Hall Barn estate winch was
his country seat.
On the occasion of his eightieth
birthday, in 1913, t he journalists of
Great Britain paid a remarkable trib
ute of t heir respect. A large delega
tion headed by Lord Nortbcliffe, vis
ited Lord Burnliam's country house
and presented an address to t lie dean
of newspaper proprietors, which was
signed by all the leading British news
paper men. Messages of congratula
tions were sent by the king and iieon
by many public men and organiza
tions, and telegrams of congratula
tion came from all parts of the world.
The career of the proprietor of
the Daily Telegraph was one of hard
work and steady advancement from a
small beginning. After an academic
schooling at the University College
School in London, where he won sev
eral prizes, he was given the choice
between entering London University
or joining his father in busines. He
selected the latter pursuit. His fath

property In 1S55 and spent his life !

paper. In that year the paper was
reduced from two pence to a penny
(two cents) and was the first London
daily paper at that price, which it
has maintained to the present day,
although all London competitors with
