LONDON, Jan. 9 Suffragettes
held a demonstration in Hyde Park1
today to protest against the compul
sion bill. Addresses were made by
numerous speakers, women and men,
from five platforms, around which
large crowds were gathered.
There was considerable heckling of
the speakers by the crowd and soon
after the beginning of the suffragette
demonstration, a group of men wear
ing Derby armlets organized a counter
meeting nearby, where speeches in
favor of compulsion lasted as long as
the suffragette speakers held out.
The crowds were in good humor and
the meetings broke up without any
violence after the suffragettes had
passed a resolution against conscrip
tion and industrial compulsion and de
manding a more democratic form of
government in which the women shall
have a vote.

WITHDRAWAL FROM GALLIPOLI
SINK
IF BATTLESHIP
CAUSES PIG AMONG BRITISH
With the withdrawal of the British
and French forces from the southern
tip of the Gallipoli peninsula, after the
evacuation of the Anzac cove and
Suvla bay position on the western
coast, in the middle of December,
there has come to an end a movement
that was begun with expectations that
it would have a great bearing on the
outcome of the war.
Thousands upon thousands of men
lost their lives in effecting landings
on the Turkish coast and in the fight
ing since. In addition, a number of
battleships and smaller war craft of
the entente allies have been sunk or
damaged.
The chief military purpose of the
Dardanelles campaign, which was be
gun in February, 1 S 1 5, with the bom
bardment of Turkish forts at the en
trance of the straits, was the capture
of Constatinople and the opening of
the Bosphorus, which connects the
Mediterranean with the Black sea, so
that Russia might have an avenue for
I the receipt of arms and ammunition
and also for the exportation of Rus
sian grain. For England, success
meant the prevention of another
Turkish invasion of Egypt, and the
permanent safety of the Suez canal
and England's communications with
India.
In October, after the successful in
vasion of Servia by the Teutons, the
Bulgars, and the reports that German
ammunition was on its way to Turkey,

LONDON, Jan. 9. The remaining j
positions held by the allies of Galli
poli Peninsula have now been aban
doned with the wounding of only one
man among the British and French,
according to a British official state
ment issued tonight.
This news has been expected for
several days by the keener observers
of the Near Eastern campaign, for
the retirement of the troops from
Anzac and Suvla bay three weeks
ago left no strategic advantage to the
retention of the tip of the Peninsula.
Nevertheless, the news will be re
ceived with a pang of regret by the
people of the .British Isle?, as well
as the Colonies.
Renewed activity of various kinds'
noted by the Turkish official com
munications in the 'past few days,
has presumably been in the nature
of preparations for the final act of
the Dardanelles tragedy. Tonight's
Turkish official statement covering
the period from Thursday to Satur
day, records the increasing effective
ness of reinforcements of the Turk
ish batteries which have been draw
ing in and concentrating on the al
lies' remaining positions.
Another pang to the British public
will bo caused by the. announcement
of the loss of the battleship King
Edward VII, which has been blown
up by a mine. The brief official
statement on this suhject does not
reveal the scene of the action and
merely says that the disaster occurred
in a heavy sea, despite which the
entire crew was saved before the
ship went down.

was a complete reorganization of the
French cabinet which was generally
attributed to the Balkan situation.
The sending of the fleet to force the
Dardanelles without the co-operation
of land forces was generally considered
to have been the big initial blunder of
the campaign. The inadequacy of the
land forces when they were sent was
criticised as another.
The campaign was marked by three
major operations, one by the fleet
alone and two by the land forces as
sisted by the fleet. The net result was
the conquest of the tip of the Gallipoli
peninsula for a distance of three miles
and a narrow segment of its middle
western coast about twelve miles in
length and hardly a mile deep.
Naval forces were landed March 24
at Seddul-Bahr, the tip of the penin

distant, at Elbussan. Albania.

The London morning papers com
ment with satisfaction and relief on
the successful evacuation of Gallipoli.
They consider, despite General Mon
roe's generous tribute to Generals
Birdwood and Davies, that credit for
the remarkable doul le retirement
should be attributed to General Monro
himself. The Times says editorially:
"Twice within a lew weeks General
Monro has engaged to remove his men
and guns under the eyes of the Turks
and their German officers. We doubt
if a precedent for such an achieve
ment can be found in the annals of
war.
"The extraordinary freedom from

WASHINGTON, Jan. 9. The policy
of the department of justice in the en
forcement of the anti-trust laws is
outiined at length in a statement made
public tonight by the chamber of com
merce of the Unieed States, announc
ing the result of the several confer
ences between Mr. Gregory and a com
mittee of the organization.
The outline, which was submitted to
and approved by the attorney general,
is prefaced by an explanation that the
chamber has constantly been presented
with inquiries with regard to the re
lationship that might be established
between the federal trade commission
and the department, and with requests
for information as to the government's
attitude in future anti-trust proceed
ings. The attorney general was told,
the statement says, that an expression
from him "might be regarded as reas
suring to the public mind" and might
"dispel some of the uncertainty which
heretofore existed."
The statement in part follows:
"By way 0f introduction the attorney
general expressed the view that much
of the misunderstanding that exists in
some quarters in relation to the Sher
man act is due to the fact that in the
minds of many it has come to he
thought of as a statute apart from the
general body of laws. This, he pointed
out, is not the case. On the contrary,
the Sherman act is enforced by the de
pat tment of justice in the same man
ner and according to the same rules of
policy as other statutes with the
same care and with neither more nor
less rigor. Plain or inentional viola
tions are proceeded against vigorously
as under other statutes. When, as with
all statutes, doubtful cases arise in
which there was no intent to violate
the law. thev are dealt with just as
similar cases under other statutes are
dealt with: that is, with a view to en
forcing strict compliance with the law,
but without unnecessarily stigmatizing
or unnecessarily burdening with litiga
tion persons who have been honestly
mistaken as to the'law and who stand
ready to rectify their mistake.
"Four points were taken up.
'First: The complaint that the law
is uncertain.
"Second: The policy of the depart
ment of justice as regards the methods
of enforcing the law in admittedly
doubtful cases.
'Third: The means adopted by the
department to guard against unjust
prosecutions.
"Fourth: The policy of the depart
ment in cases where it and the federal
trade commission are both charged
with the enforcement of the law.
"Concerning the first point, the at
torney general stated that while con
cededly there is in the law of restraint
of trado an area of doubt, in the vast
majority of cases it is not difficult to
tell whether a proposed transaction is
or is not in violation of the statute.
Such doubt as there is. he further
stated, will be gre:Ulyxreduced by de
cisions in the shipping pool case, the
anthracite coal case, the Harvester
case, the Steel case and the United
Shoe Machinerv case, which are now
pending in the supreme court.
"This led to the question as to the
policy of the department as regards the
mc'.hod of enforcing the law in those
cases which are admittedly doubtful.
On that point, the attorney general
stated that where men have entered
into a transaction believing in good
faiih that the transaction is a lawful
one. and subsequently upon complaint
mane, the department reaches the con
clusion that the transaction was not in
accordance with the statute, it has not
and will not be the policy of the de
partment to invoke extreme penalties
against them. In such a ease the de
partment would consider that the just
and quickest way of enforcing the law
would he by a civil proceeding in
which the question involved could be
contested or a consent decree entered,
or hy a notice of the department's conclusion-
with opportunity to abandon or
modify the transaction.
''In this connection the attention of
the attorney general was eajled to

eral Trade Commission law which au

NEW YORK, Jan. 9. Six of the
eleven former directors of the New
York, New Hoven and Hartford rail
road, charged by the government
with criminal violation of the Sher
man anti-trust law, were found not
guilty late today by the jury that
for nearly three months has been
trying the case. The jury disagreed
on the five others.
Those acquitted were D. Newton
Barney, Furmington, Conn.; Robert
W. Taft, Providence, R. I.; James S.
Hemingway, A. Heaton Robertson
and Frederick F. Brewster, New Ha
ven, and Henry K. McCharg, Stam

Those on whom the jury disagreed
were William Rockefeller, New York:
Charles F. Brooker, Ansonia, Conn.;
Charles M. Pratt, Brooklyn: Lewis
Cass Ledyard. New York, and Ed
ward D. Robbins, New Haven.
The verdict was returned at 4:30
o'clock this afternoon after fifty-one
hours of deliberation, and the jury
was discharged. The first vote on
the five defendants upon which the
jjrors could not agree stood 8 to 4 1
for acquittal.
R. L. Batts, chief counsel for the
government, annifunced that he would
move for a new trial of , these five.
This will le done, he said, before any
effort will be made to try the six
other former directors of the -road
that were indicted but who obtained
the ritrht to be tried seoaratelv. I
The jurors did not reach their ver
dict until after they had reported
to Judge Hunt earlier in the day that
thp- mold not aprpp ln to th:ir!
time noon they had been deliber
ating with a view to bringing in a
verdict on the guilt or innocence of
the defendants collectively. The
court then instructed them to make
further efforts to concur, and that if
they could not agree upon all, to try
and reach a decision on some. The
vote of the question of all, at that
time also stood 8 to 4 for acquittal,
it was learned.
On returning to the jury room the
jurors renewed their discussion with
the court's instructions in mind, and
unanimously eliminated the six de
fendants that were acquitted.

PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 10. At
least eight persons are reported to
have been killed in an explosion
at the plant of the Dupont Pow
der Company at Carney's Point,
early today. The steamer Long
Beach, which was just leaving its
docks, was blown partly out of the
water. None of the passengers,
however, are believed to have been
hurt. The force of the explosion
was so great that it was heard in
this city, 25 miles distant.
Later reports said that 13 had
been killed and seven severely
burned: that the blast was caused
by outside influences and that two
men had been arrested. As all
wire communication to Carney's
Point was cut off by the explosion
none of these reports could be
confirmed.
The explosion occurred in the
Boscher plant mill, where the
finest grades of smokeless powder
are prepared for shipment. It
happened shortly after the force
of workers had changed at mid
night. According to an employe who
witnessed the explosTon there were
only six persons killed and about
four injured. The explosion, he
said, occurred in No. 2 wet house
of plant No. 2 and that it was the
belief among the men that it had
been caused by outside influences.
Reports that two men with dyna
mite and nitroglycerine in their
possession had been arrested
could not be confirmed.
Wire communication at Carney's
Point was completely cut off by
the explosion and officials of the
Dupont company in Wilmington
declared that they had absolutely
no advices beyond the fact that
there had been an explosion.
