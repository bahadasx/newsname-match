LORD BURHHAH DEAD
WAS FAMOUS EDITOR
Owner of London Telegraph and
Last of Old School Passes
Away at Ripe Age,
STORY OF HIS VERY BUSY LIFE
LONDON, .Tan. 9. Lord Burnham
died today after an illness of more
than p. month.
. Lord Durnham. the proprietor of
the Dally Telegraph, was the last of
the old school of London newspaper
owners. Through his working years,
from young manhoo,1 to an older age
than most men remain In harness,
he controlled the business affairs
and the editorial policies of that
paper, lie made it one of the great
est properties among newspapers, as
well as a great aper from the news
standpoint. Born Edward Levy, on
December 28, 1833, oldest of a fam
ily of eight children of J. M. Levy,
he assumed, in 1875, the surname of
his uncle, Lionel Lawson, and waB
Edward Levy-Lawson. On October
13, 1892, he was created a baronet,
and on July 31. 1903, he was raised
to the peerage as Baron Burnham.
His title was taken from the Hun
dred of Burnham, Bucks, which con
tains most of the Hall Barn estate,
which was his country seat.
Honored by Journalist.
On the occasion of his eightieth birth
day, In 1913. the Journalists of Great Brit
ain paid a remarkable tribute of their re
spect. A larsc delegation headed by Lord
Northcliffe visited Lord Burnham's coun
try house and presented an address to the
dozen of newspaper proprietors, which
was signed by all the leading British
newspaper men. Messages of congratula
tions were sent by the king and queen,
by many public men and organizations,
and telegrams of congratulations came
from all parts of the world.
The career of the proprietor of the Dally
Telegraph wsa one of hard work and
steady advancement from a small begin
ning. After an academic schooling at the
University College school In London,
where he won several prises, he waa given
the choice between entering London uni
versity or Joining his father In business.
He selected the latter pursuit. His father
was head of a printing firm, and in 1853
had acquired a email newspaper, the
Dally Telegraph and Courier. Young !
Levy was given charge of this property i
In 1855 and spent his life in developing !
it into a great newspaper. I
Paper of the People.
For many years the Dally Telegraph
was the largest London paper In the
number of Its columns, and probably no
newspaper in the world has expended
more "money tn felegisth and cable tolls.
It has always been the paper of the
middle classes, as the Times was tradi
tionally the paper of tho diplomatic nd
official world, of the universities and the
Church of England, and as the Morning
Pout lias been the organ of society. The
number of Its columns of advertising for
many years gave evidence that It waa
the most profitable property.
Ix3id Burnham was active and promi
nent through his later life in tho News
paper Press fund and tho Intitute of
Journalists, and In various public move
ments, and was a prominent Free Mason.
A few years ago he retired from active
newspaper work, and spent moat of hla
time surrounded by his family at hi."
country place. There he enjoyed shooting
and other outdoor pursuits, and enter
tained at different times the late King)
Edward and King George.

Are Retaken.
BAD SUNDAY FOR THE ALLIES
BERLIN, Jan. 9. (By Wireless.)
The war office announced that
near Hlrzsteln, south of Hartman's
Wcllerkopf, the Germans yesterday
completed their re-conqueut of the
trenches which on December 21 loll
into the hands of the French.
Twenty officers, 1.083 cbp.sseurs and
fifteen machine guns were captured.
LONDON, Jan. 9. Tho remaining
positions held by, the allien on Galll
poll peninsula have now been aban
doned with the wounding of only
one man among the British and
French, according to a riritish of
ficial statement issued tonight.
This news has been .expected for sev
eral days by the keener observers of the
near eastern campaign, for the retirement
of the troops from Ansae and Suvla bay
three weeks ago left no strategic advan
tage to the retention of the tip of tho
peninsula.
Mews Shock to Many,
Nevertheless the news lll be received
with a pang of regret by the people of
the British Isles as well as the colonies.
Renewed activity of various kinds noted
by the Turkish official communications
In the last few days, has presumably been
in the nature of preparations for the final
act of the Dardanelles tragedy. Tonight's
Turkish official, covering the period from
Thursday to Saturday, records the in
creasing effectiveness of reinforcements
of the. Turkish batteries which have been
drawing in and concentrating, on the
allies' remaining positions.
One More Reverse.
Another pang to the. British public will
be caused by the announcement tonight
of the loss of the battleship King Edward
VII, which has been blown up by a mine.
The brief official statement on this sub
ject does not reveal tho scene of the ac
tion, and merely says that the disaster
occurred in a heavy Sea, despite which
the entire crew was saved before the
ship went down.
Heavy Montr Loss.
The King ICdward VII represented an
investment of nearly 1.600.000 and was
one of the finest of the last class of pre
dreadiiaughta, corresponding In general to
Itlie American ships of the New Jersey and
Nebraska type, and was onH? slightly
older than the Natal, which was sunk
by an Internal explosion about a week
ago.

THE HAGUE, Jan. 9. (Via Lon

peace expedition reached The Hague
esterday. Members, of the party
plan to begin immediately the work
of spreading the peace propaganda.
The trip from Copenhagen, in a
special train through Germany,
touching Lubeck, Hamburg and
Bremen, was filled with impressive
suggestions ot war. At the im
portant stations the American peace
advocates passed trainloads of sol
diers bound for the front and Ited
Cross nurses in hospital coaches.
The progress of the expedition through
Germany was watched by silent crowds,
except at one place where a German lieu
tenant lifted his helmet and wished sue
cess to the project.
Trip Made In Hark.
The entire trip over German territory
was made after dark.
Arriving at tne German port of Warne.
muende In a ferryboat from Denmark,
the Americans, with tho Norwegian,
Swedish snd Danish delegates, were met
by a special train. The train, which was
provided by special permission of the mil
itary authorities, stood on tho dock sur
rounded by soldiers. As tho peace ad
vocates stood on the platform In tho dusk,
in drizzling rain, they wero selected one
by one as their names wero called end
permitted to go at oard tho train. Then
the train was locked and started quickly
for the trip across northwestern Ger
many. After awhile the military guards on the
train relaxed the rules and permitted the
travelers to look out of the windows, in
the brilliantly lighted stations at Lubeck,
Hamburg aud Bremen the pilgrims
caught their first glimpses of military
acthlty.

Groups of Red Cross nurses wero seen
on the platforms; soldiers were leaning
out of the windows of Incoming and out
going trains; tho familiar gray-coated
German officers were pacing back sad
forth and frequently a crowd of civilians
anticipating the passing of the expedi
tion, hurriod for a closer inspection of the
train.
Kvldonce of the war was not missing
from, the train itself. Only one dining
car was provided for the 300 travelers
The railroad employes explained that all
the dining cars wero being used to trans,

Posted in the cars were printed notice,
calling upon the public to eat sparingly
and not waste food. One of these notices
Kave ten rules, admonishing the people
to cook potatoes with skins on. save
the scraps of bread and abstain from
meat.
Another notice was to the effect that
when the train was passing over bridges
or through tunnels, the window and
doors should be locked becauso spies on
occasion had thrown bombs with the
purpose of destroying the railroad.
Trala Speeds tfnmt.
After leaving Hamburg, and while ap
proaching the western fighting sone, the
train waa kept at its highest speed and
the usual stops at the smaller stations
were omitted. The crowds at some of
these stations indicated that the people
along the railroad had been informed
of the coming of the expedition. Yet
the spectators everywhere viewed the
train silently.
One enlivening Incident, however, oc
curred at Kent helm, near the Holland
frontier. There, near the end of the
trip throuch Germany all th.
! of the expedition were to have been
searched, but the authorities, through the
lieutenant In charge of the train, an
nounced that the searching had been set
aside.
The travellers crowded Into the little
station restaurant at S o'clock in the
morning and began cheering. Rev. Jen
kin IJoyd Jonea of Chicago thereupon
mounted a chair and thanked the Ger
man authorities. He explained the pur
pose of the peace expedition.

Cries Came for a speech from the Ger
man lieutenant. He finally mounted
the chair, lifted his helmet and said:
"I hope your project will meet with
success."
More cheering rang through the little
country station. Izater the Holland
