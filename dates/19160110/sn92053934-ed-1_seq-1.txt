Berlin Reports Forces of I
Great Britain in Meso
potamia, Surrounded.
BEATING A RETREAT?
According to Advices the
Main Body of the English
Is Now Withdrawing.
Berlin, Jan. 10 tby wireless to Say
Tille. X. V.) The British army at Kut-EI-Amara,
in Mesopotamia, has now
been surrounded completely by the
Turks, arcording to Constantinople
advices given out today by the Over
seas News agency. It is said the
Turks have advanced to the main de
fenses of the British.
The main British army in Mesopota
mia, according to these advices, is in
retreat. 10,000 men having been left at
Kut-EI-Amara to cover the movement.
Faced Superior Numbers.
Recent dispatches have indicated
that the British expedition in Meso
potamia was confronted by Turkish
forces of superior size and that it
would have difficulty in maintaining
itself at Kut-EI-Amara. The defenses
of the city were attacked by the
Turks some time ago, resulting in se
vere fighting, but the British were
able to respulse the assaults.
The retreat from Kut-EI-Amara
assuming the correctness of the un
official advices from Berlin appar
ently means the abandonment by the
British of any attempt for the present
it least of an offensive campaign in
Mesopotamia. It was in November of
1914 that an Anglo-Indian force, start
ing from the Persian gulf, began
marching north and west over the deB
ert. The fighting was slow and ex
hausting, but the British pushed
northward until September of 1915,
when thev reached Kut-EI-Amara, I
which is 230 miles northwest of the
head of the Persian gulf. They de
feated the Turks there and advanced
to Ctesiphon, IS miles below Bagdad.
The Turks sent up large forces to
save Bagdad and, after an initial de
feat, won a victory over the invaders.
The British fell back on Kut-EI-Amara,
105 miles southeast of Bagdad,
but there has been no previous inti
mation that they intended to evacuate
this point.

Crazed Over
War, Noted
Bugatti Dies
Paris, Jan. 10, (4:35 a. m.) The
Italian animal sculptor, Rembrandt
Bugatti, was found lying unconscious
yesterday In his studio in the Rue Jos-eph-Bara,
suffering from gas poison
ing. A gas Jet In the studio was turn
ed on. Bugatti was taken to Laennec
hospital, where he died.
The work of Signor Bugatti, who was
regarded as one of the foremost living
sculptors, is represented in most of the
galleries of Europe. When the war
opened he was modeling animals at
the zoological gardens in Antwerp.
He gave up this work and devoted him
self to assisting the Belgian ambu
lance corps. When Antwerp was evac
uated he went to Holland and thence
to Italy, but as his class was not mob
ilized he came to Paris.
Of late months war seemed to have
affected the sculptor profoundly. He
was depressed by the sufferings of the
Belgians, for whom he had great ad
miration. Signor Bugatti gave up
some time ago his work in the spe
cialty which won him fame, saying:
"This is not the time to make animals."
He devoted himself entirely to a new
Interpretation of Christ. This work,
now at the foundry, is his last.
