EXPLOSION IS
FATAITOIRIO
Outside Agencies Not Sus
picioned in New Jersey
Accident.
WILDEST RUMORS
WERE CURRENT
Force of Concussion Felt 25
Miles Away—Property
Loss Small.
Philadelphia, Jan. 10.—Three men
were killed and a number injured in
an explosion of smokeless powder
early this morning at the plant of the
Dupont Powder Works at Carneys
Point, New Jersey. It had been re
ported that a large number of men
lost their lives, but after investigation
the superintendent said only three
were dead.'
The cause of the explosion is not
known, but, according to officials,
there is no suspicion that the blast
was due to outside agencies.
The report that arrests had been
made is denied. The blast was ter
rific, being felt 2B miles away.
Wire communication with the plant
were cut off by the shock, with the re
sult that wildest rumors prevailed un
til dalyllght cleared away the extent
of the accident.
Property loss is said to be compar
atively small as the explosion occurred
in a building some distance from the
main buildings of the big plant.
Government Active.
Ono of the reports in circulation is
that government agents from the Du
pont police force has been watching
suspicious pprsons who went to the
plant from Wilmington, Delaware, by
boat and that two carrying bombs and
fuses, were arrested.
C. B. Landls. representative of the
company, branded all these reports as
false.
COMMETCAUZED VICE
IS 6EINGJRADICATED
Such is Report Made by Investigation
Bureau—On November 1 Only 735
Places Were Found In New York.
0.--—Immorality
and commercialised vice are being
rapidly eradicated in New York, ac*
cording to a report made yesterday
of a recent survey by the bureau of
social hygiene, of which John D.
Rockefeller, Jr., is chairman. The
report is Intended to supplement an
investigation made In .19.12. The re
port states that on November 1, 1915,
only 785 disorderly places were found
as compared with 2,482 such places in
1912.
"Data secured during the present
investigation shows that collusion be
tween exploiters of vice and officials
in the police department has ceased,"
states the report. "Petty grafting
still occurs. The man on the beat
may take a small bribe to overlook a
breach of the law, but this will not
prevent a raid ordered from head
quarters. New York possesses a po
lice administration absolutely honest
at the top. The force has been im
mensely Improved in morals by the
improved tone of headquarters."

Youngstown, Ohio, Jan. 10.—rBeliev
ing that tho situation is well under
control after two days of tranquility
following the rioting Friday night,
preparations are being made to re
open the plants of the Youngstown
Sheet and' Tube company in East

James A. Campbell of the company
said today that former employes who
reported today would be put to work
making repairs incident to a resump

He denied that strike breakers would
be imported.
"It would be useless for us to at
tempt to operate our plant while some
of the workers are in the frame of
mind they are in now," President
Campbell said, "and we 'will not at
tempt to resume operations for several
days at least. There are workmen
now in the plants."
Fear for Families.
President Campbell said that many
workmen had informed the company
that they desired to return to work,
but were afraid as their families had
been threatened.
"We do not need any protection for

workers, their families and their
homes protected," added President

Cablegram Sent to Premier

Sent to Wilson.
Chicago, Jan. 10.—A cablegram
urging Great Britain to lift the block
ade sufficiently to admit supplies to
the destitute of Poland, was put on
the wires here last night, addressed
to H. Asquith, prime minister of Eng
land.
A telegram also was sent to Presi
dent Wilson quoting the dispatch to
Mr. Asquith and to the British, Ger
man, French, Italian, Russian and
Austro-Hungarian embassies at Wash
ington. The communication to Mr.
Asquith follows:
"The undersigned duly elected offi
cers of legally constituted organiza
tions, numbering half a million Ameri
can citizens, representatives of four
million Polish speaking residents of
the United States, hereby most re
spectfully present an unanimous re
quest to his majesty's government that
the blockade against ships carrying
provisions and clothing and destined
for the war stricken districts of Po
land, be raised and vessels carrying
such cargo, be permitted to unload at
the harbor of Danzig or some other
suitable port for distribution among
inhabitants of that part of Poland de
vastated by war.
"We base this request upon the
broadest demands of humanity. The
terrors of war visited upon the inno
cent, peaceful population of Poland
have been augmented by famine, pes
tilence and death. One-third of a
generation, the youngest, has practi
cally ceased to exist. The remaining,
youth, old men and women, are now
upon the threshold of extinction by
starvation, disease and exposure. The'
world cannot countenance the exter
mination of an entire nation In such
excruciating agony."

NO ANNOUNCEMENT
OF RESULT MADE
Phraseology of the German
Note Has Caused the
Long Delay.
Washington, Jan. 10.—Count von
Berntorff, German ambassador, and
Secretary Lansing had another con
ference in the Lusitania negotiations,
which both agreed should be regarded
as confidential.
The ambassador expects to confer
with the secretary again inside of a
week, and then rot again on the sub
ject. That fact ia taken by those con
versant with the status of the case to
mean that Germany and the United
States have approached a point in the
negotiations where only one more ex
change between Washington and Ber
lin Will be necessary before the long
controversy is ended.
"Very Favorable."
American officials in all quarters
declared the situation "as very favor
able," and reflected the view that a
satisfactory settlement is in sight
which will include indemnities for 115
American lives lost, and some expres
sion of regret or disavowal which will
be mutually satisfactory to Germany
and the United States.
President Wilson, Secretary Lan
sing and the German ambassador are
practically the only officials in the se
cret of the negotiations, but it is
known that the principal point which
has been delaying final settlement was
phraseology.
Germany has contended that the
best disavowal she could offer is her
orders to the submarine commanders
not to repeat such incident, and that
she could not disavow the action, al
though she regretted the loss of so
many American lives.
The United States has been con-'
tending that the disavowal should be
expressed in some way. It is believed
that a form of expression has been
found which will be satisfactory to
both. The one more exchange be
tween Washington and Berlin will set
tle the case, unless something unfore
seen comes up.

recall the proud words of Mr. Asquith

that the Turkish empire had commit

and those of Mr. Churchill of a later
date, that through the Dardanelles lay
