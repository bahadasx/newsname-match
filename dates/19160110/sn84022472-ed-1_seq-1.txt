increase the taxes of business men,
manufacturers and the taxes on cen

not changed hands in the past "decade,
"are1 well: known.But even, this big

There -are members of the board of
. apportionment who resent the action
of the 'administration in appointing
' the advisory bonding issue. There are
also several members of -the advisory
tax board who are not in sympathy
with creating a big bond issue. Most
of the special cotamitteei were named,
however, because they " would be in
terested in such "large expenditures.
Some of the members- of the board
of apportionment who are conserva
. tive business men declare that the
plans of the administration means a
Juggling of the1 finances which will be
absolutely dangerous to the property
holders. ' There is already ear,ly a
huge blanket' mortgage on the city o
nearly a million dollars -for Warren

posal to increase thi3 by $1, 500,000
means an enormous , increase in the
tax rate within another year no mat
ter what jugglery is resorted to to
keep the rate down this year." Under
the proposed bond issue every prop

home of the humblest may be taken

John Skelton Williams, Gbmptroller. of the Gurrehcy describes

Mr. Williams gives a comparative
statement of the condition of the na
tional banks to back up his statement.
He shows that net resources of the
banks increased in 'the year $1,743,-878,64S!--that
deposits increased $2,
081,538,164 and that loans and dis
counts increased $917,450,502. Avail
able - cash . increased in the same
period $862,000,000 and on ISTev. 10,
1 9 1,5, , the reporting national banks
had exces1 reserves of $891,000,000.
Tables show the comparative. Condi
tion -of "banks in 3.-8-95 and 1915. In
September 1895, there were 3,712 re
porting banks with . net deposits of
$1,989,300,000-'"and loans and dis

"exceeded by $587,000,000 the great

amounted to -more than Hhe ' total
lbans and discounts of all banks, in

The following despatch, under date

"The Milli Agency staates that the

three days for the attack on the Brit
ish and French f and that the results!
are not yet fully known. . All the po-

London, Jan. "10. Sir Percy Lake'
has been appointed ; to command the
British forces in Mesopotamia in suc
ce'sssion to General Sir John Ecclea I
Ntxon, who has been compelled by ill- j
health to- return ! home, -it was an
nounced' in the House of, Commons to
day by J. Austen Chamberlain, sec
certary for India. -
Recent despatches have Indicated
that the 'British expedition in Mesopo- ,
tamial was( confronted by Turkish
forces of superior size , and that it
would have difficulty in maintaining i
itself at Kut-El-Amara. The defenses '
of . the city in fact, were attacked by
the Turks some time ago, resulting in ,
severe fighting, but the .British were
able to repulse the assaults. ' .
The retreat from Kut-El-Amara, as- ;
suming the correctness of the unoffi
cial advices from Berlin, apparently ,
means the abandonment by the Bri.ish j
of . any attempt, for the present at j
least, of an offensive campaign irt :
Mesopotamia.. It was in November of .'
1914 that an Anglo-Indian force, start- ,
Ing. from the, Persian gulf, began !
marching north and west over the dea- J
ert, following the Tigris and Euphra- ;
tes rivers wherever possible.
