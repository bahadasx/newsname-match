abandoned with the) wounding of only
one man among the British and
French, according to 'a -British official
statement issued tonight.
, . This news has been expected for
several days by the keener observers
of the near eastern campaign, for the
retirement of the troops from Anzac
and Suvla Bay three weeks ago left
no strategic advantage to the reten
tion of the tip of the peninsula. Never
theless, the new was received with
regret by the people of the British
Isles as well as the colonies.
Renewed Activity of Turks.
- Renewed activity of various kinds
' noted by the Turkish official com
munications in the past few days has
presumably been in the nature of
preparations for the final act of the

, t " "British Subjects Regretful. ' 5";
1 Aiother pang to the British public
will be caused by the announcement
tonight of the loss of the battleship
King Edward VH, which has been
blown up by a mine. The brief official
statement on this subject does not re
veal the scene of the accident and
merely says that the disaster occurred
in a heavy sea, despite which the en
tire crew was saved before the ship
went down.
British Battleship Sunk..
V The King Edward VII represented an
investment of nearly 1,600,000 and
was one of the finest of the last claes
of pre-dreadnoughts, corresponding in
general to the American, ships of the
Mew Jersey and Nebraska type, and
was only slightly older than the Natal,
which was sunk by an internal explo
sion about a week ago.
; tio Developments of Importance.
" On the west and east fronts there
have been no developments of large
importance over the week end. The
German communication announced
that the Germans have completed the
recapture of positions on Hartmanns
Weilerrkopa taken by the French a few
days bofore Christmas.
Greek correspondents continue to as
sert that the Bulgarians and Germans
are hastening. plans for an attack on
Saloniki. But the Austriane are fight
ing hard against the Russians and
Montenegrins and the 'Bulgars and are
largely occupied in a resolute attempt
to reach the Adriatic, from which they
are only forty miles distant at Elhas
aan, Albania.
- England's Internal Affairs Quiet.
i- England's internal affairs are quiet,
pending the reassembling of parlia
. ment. There will be night debate on
the compulsion bill Tuesday, with
David Lloyd George, minister of muni,
tlona, and Arthur Henderson, labor
member, who has just resigned from
the cabinet, as the probable star
speakers. Sir Henry Dalziel, who has
been one of the most consistent critics
of the government, will also give his
reasons why he supports the govern
ment on this matter.
1 ; The labor party will meet early In
the week to consider its position. Un
less, however, opposition to the bill
develops, a strength of which there is
no Indication now. there seems no
likelihood that the government will
feel need to appeal to the country.

MOHR MURDER TRIAL
IN PROVIDENCE TODAY
It Is Understood Healis Will Be State's
Principal Witness.
Providence, R. ' I., Jan. 9. A murder
trtal of unusual interest, tn Which Mrs..
Elizabeth- - F.-. Mohr.jtndV-tw. -negroes
will appear as defendants on charges
growing out of the killing of her hus
band. Dr. Franklin Mohr, four months
ago will begin here tomorrow. Mrs.
Mohr is under indictment as an ac
cessory before the fact to the mur
der, the state's contention being that,
prompted by jealousy, she hired the
negroes to commit the crime. Cecil V.
Brown and Henry Spellman, half
brothers, are the negroes who will be
tried for murder."

his secretary, MIfs Emily Burger, was,
shot from ambush on the West Bar
rington road on the night of August
81, while his automobile was stalled.

covering consciousness, but Miss Bur

chauffeur, at a point previously agreed
upon with the other negroes, who had
come up from behind on motorcycles.
Healis will not be tried. He was
unexpectedly brought into court by
Assistant Attorney General Abbott
Phillips last Friday and, after the
murder Indictment found against him
had been quashed, pleaded nolo con
tendre to a charge of manslaughter.
Sentence has been deferred. It is un
derstood that he win appear as the
state's principal witness.
Shortly after the murder Healis
made an alleged confession to the po
lice of Barrington to the effect that
he had driven over the Barrington
road at the suggestion of Brown, a
stable man whom Dr. Mohr had dis
charged. - He . alleged that Brown was
acting for Mrs. Mohr. Subsequently,
the police are said to have obtained
from the other two negroes a state
ment that they were In the pay of the
pnysician s wire, mat sne had bought
the motorcycles which they used and
had agreed to give Healis and Brown
$2,000 each, and Spellman $500. The
men later retracted these statements
and it is uncertain whether they will

CHIEF A SUICIDE.
Chief Ogallala Fire Took Part in
" Custer Massacre.
the
Chicago, Jan. 9. Chief Ogallala Fire,
who fought with Sitting Bull in the
Custer massacre, died at a hospital
today, aged 90. A week ago, appar
ently tired of life, he cut his throat
and has been unconscious much of the
time since.
Chief Ogallala Fire was one of the
Sioux Indian chiefs who with Sitting
Bull fought against the encroachments
of the white settlers and who repeat
edly gave battle to United States reg
Ulars. "' .
He was severely wounded in ' the
battle - In which General Custer - and
bis troops' were slaughtered -and. bore
the scars of that encounter to his
death. . Two bullet wounVs and a
sabre slash left him wounded on the
field and It was months before he was
able to take part in other fights.
.- He was known as one of the bravest
of the Indjan chiefs who followed Sit
ting Bull and the annals of western
Indian warfare have many tales of
raid planned and executed by Chief
uganaia ire.
On the hospital cot the aged In
dlan said he did not like to talk of
the old days of Indian war. "We did
not understand the ways of the white
men. We had to yield. It is not right
for me to talk of the days when we
went on the warpath- because now it
Is not considered brave," said the old
chief.
One of the proudest possessions of
the old man ia a soldiers belt which
the chief said he had taken from an
adversary killed by him at Custer's
last fight. The belt is now covered
with beads.
When Chief Ogallala Fire made his
first appearance in a wild west show
he wore a long chair main of $5 and
$10 gold pieces. His granddaughter
said that he gave nearly all of the
gold pieces to children in neighbor'
hoods in which he had lived.

- Jury Out 51 Hours.
The verdict was returned at 4.30
o'clock this afternoon, after 51 hours of
deliberation, and the Jury was dis
charged. The final vote on the five
defendants upon whom the "jurors
could not agree stood 8 to 4 for ac
quittal. R. L. Batts, chief counsel for
the government, announced that in
due time he would move for a new
trial of these five. This will be djne,
he said,' before any effort will be made
to try the six other former directors
of the road who. were Indicted but who
obtained the right' to be tried sep
arately. ' : .-
Instructed by Court.
' -The 3iiror-did not ' reach their 'ver
dict an til- after they had reported to
Judge Hunt earlier in the day that
they could not agree; Up -to that time
noon they had been deliberating
with, a view to bringing in a verdict
on the guilt or innocence of the de
fendants collectively. The court then
Instructed them to-make further ef
forts to concur and that if they could
not agree upon all, to try and reach a
decision on some. The vote on the
question of all at that time also stood
S to 4 for acquittal, it was learned.
Two Jurors Held Out.
On returning to the Jury room, the
Jurors renewed their discussion with
the court's instructions in mind and
unanimously eliminated the six defend
ants who were acquitted. Two of the
four jurors who had voted against the
defendants originally stood firm, how
ever, against Messrs. Rockefeller, Led
yard, Brooker, Pratt and - Robbins.
Then the other two switched to their
original position, leaving 8 to 4 as the
final verdict.
From the time the case was submit
ted to them at 1.30 o'clock Friday af
ternoon, the Jurors took in all 18 bal
lots. The first stood six for acquattal,
four for conviction and two blank. It
was not until Saturday that they
reached the 8 to 4 alignment.
Rockefeller Not Present.
William Rockefeller, who Is iy, and
Henry K. McHarg were not present
when the jurors, haggard and untidy,
filed in the cou room to render their
verdict- The nine other defendants
were in their usual seats. Some of
them, during the long hours of wait
ing, had laughed and joked with coun
sel and newspapermen. Others dis
played much nervousness, particularly
after Judge Hunt s instructions today,
urging the jury to bring in a verdict
as to some Individually. With the en
trance of the Jurymen, with their hats
and coats in hand, presaging a ver
dict, the mental state of the defend
ants was obviously one of tense strain.
Read Names of Those Acquitted.
After the usual questions by the
court as to whether they had agreed on
a verdict, the foreman of the Jury read
off the names of those acquitted, then
those of the defendants upon whom
they had failed to agree. The court
thanked the jury, but hardly had he
concluded his remarks when defend
ants' attorneys and others in the court
room were on their feet and there was
a general handshaking. , Without re
gard, to their status under the verdict,
the 'defendants shook hands with the
jurors and with government counsel.
Charles S. Mellen, former president
of the New Haven and the chief wit
ness in the case, was not in court. t
Disoussed Principal Phases."
While they- had discussed - all the
principal phases of the case, the Jurors
said, the chief Issues of debate were
the matter of the alleged suppression
by the New Haven of the competition
of the Joy steamship line and the ac
quisition ' of the ' Boston " and" Maine
railroad, by which , the government
charged, the New Haven completed its
monopoly of the transportation traffic
of New England. The so-called Bfllard
transactions were virtually Ignored,
the Jurirs said, having in the opinion
of most of them- been:. ruled out by
the charge of Judge Hunt. -
There was also' comparatively little
discussion on the Metropolitan Steam
ship deal, the question being whether
it was a private transaction of Rob
bins or a joint transaction of all the
New Haven directors. The Grand
Trunk was also not a pertinent issue,
it was said. The Jurors explained that
they sought to follow the instructions
of the court in his charge that they
should decide first whether the alleged
conspiracy, of which the defendants
were acoused, was In existence in 1880,
when. tre. government charged it- be
gan and was continuous down to the
date of the indictment, : They reached
no agreement on thia question, they
said. Apparently, for the purpose of
debate, the Jurors assumed that such
a connrtracy existed and then too up

or innocence was not decided, William
Rockefeller was the only one whose
term or service as a New Haven dl- i
rector continued throughout the en-
tire time of . the alleged conspiracy. 1
He antedated Charles F. Brooker by
three years. Messrs. Ledyard and I
Pratt took part in the transactions
which led to the acquisition of the j
stock of the Boston and Maine in 1907
and as directors of the latter road, be- i
came directors of the New Haven
when the Boston and Maine was taken 1
over. Edward D. Robbins was gen- 1
era! counsel of the road and figured in ' j
the Metropolitan Steamship transac- 1
tions, which, accompanied by the for-
mation of a number of alleged dummy 1
corporations, resulted in the transfer !
of the steamships Harvard and Yale t
to the Pacific coast. j
The other directors were seldom
mentioned in the evidence and their i
chief defense was that they depended i
upon the advice of Charles S. Mellen
or Robbins in the acts charged against I
them, which virtually consisted of J
casting their votes in favor of prop- !
osltions which came before the board I
of directors for approval. . :
Jurors Unkempt and Weary. ' 1
' The Jurors were unkepmt and weary I
when they arrived at the federal 1
building this morning from the uptown 5
hotel where they had been quartered, j
None of them had for two days been ,1
given an opportunity to shave or to 1
obtain - clean, linen. . --. ,1
; They had not been deliberating two j
hours before they sent a communica- j
tlon to Judge Hunt announcing that I f
they were unable to agree. They were
soon after summoned to court, where' 1
Judge Hunt informed them that they' ,
should return and continue their dia-'
cussion. . . 3
"If it be at all possible for yon to
reach a verdict," he said, "yon should I
spare no effort to do so. I ask you'
once more to consider. If after yon
have done so with painstaking care, ;
you still find that you cannot reach '
conscientiously the unanimous conclu
sion upon the main issue as to all the
defendants. . then you mav trv vonr
convictions as to some of them. It !
might be that you can reconcile your'
differences as to come, if not to '
others.
The jury did not at first move. Then
one of the four, who had been stand
ing out - for conviction, whispered to I
the foreman. The latter shook his I
head negatively, arose abruptly and
the others followed suit, the twelve
filing out. i
- Counsel and defendants at that time
predicted that no verdict would be i
reached for at least another day and I
were accordingly surprised when It'
came a few hours later.
The defendants were indicted Feb
ruary 26, 1915. The trial began Octo-,
ber 13 last. It was estimated tonight,
that it entailed an expense to the gov-1
eminent and defendants of three-quar- '
ters of a million dollars. '.
