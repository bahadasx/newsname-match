CQOHIT JAIL LAXITY, AMD 'LEH1EHCY
OF JUDGES DEtlOUUCED DY llinORS
Tppritnrifll Trihunaf in Comprehensive Reports Gives Result o
Probe Into Many Local Affairs During 1915 Investigation
of "Jack" McGrath's Escape and Fred Gough's Story De
tailed Sentences Passed By Courts Criticized Boys' In-
dustrial School ana woaa uonamons uei tmpnauc uommen
In one of the most comprehensive and far-rraching reports ever ren
dered by a territorial grand Jury, the administration of the county Jail la.
vigorously criticized and Sheriff Charles H. Hose is held resjionsible. The
conclusions of the grand Jury, reached after a year of work, were given
to Circuit Judge Clarence W. Ashford at ! o' -lock this morning by J-ore-man
James II. Flddes. ... ' ' . .
Hating its findings on some of the stories told Ly Fred Cough, former
Inmate of the Jail, and others, first brought to the attention of the public
by the Star Bulletin, the grand Jury declares that the sheriff should have
exercised greater care regarding the men. and that laxity exists at the
city and county lock up.
The report as presented Is a type
written document of 70 pages, of w hich
21 are given over to statistics regard
Ine Jail sentences and paroles. The
other 29 pages represent one of the
inost exhaustive probes Into and sur
veys of public affairs In the city and
county, of Honolulu that any official
body has ever conducted.
The grand Jurors, In one drastic sec
Hon of their report, point out what
they declare Is an "excess of leniency
on the part of the territorial courts,
and state emphatically that the double
purpose f the law Is "most ' woe
fully forgotten. They declare that
penalties should be such as to deter
others from crime, and point out also
: that serious crimes such as embezzle
ment and robbery are prevalent to a
startling degree. The granting of pa
roles it also criticized.
Embezzlements Arc Serious. .
"We view with alarm," the Jurors
; says, "the prevalence of embezzle
ment as shown by the Increased num
ber of Indictments returned by us dur
ing the past year under this heading.
This Increase has had very serious
consideration by us and we have en
deavored to ascertain If we could not
make some recommendations to safe
guard both employer and employe."
.They add that, from their Investiga
tions, they have found that embezzle
ment has been made possible by hut
supervision. - '
Before taking up, the more weighty
matters-uche toe county Jail, boys
; - Industrial school; roads and theaters,
tfie grand Jurors devote a part of their
report to Investigations of various pub
lic Institutions in and about the city.
The veniremen, declare they are fa
vorably impressed with conditions at
the home for con-leprous girls, and the
work of the sisters of charity In car
ing for the inmates, it Is urged that
more money be given the Institution,
for the principal reason that Improve
ments to the grounds may be carried
.. cut -
A contrast Is noted In the report be.
tween the girls' home and the home
for non-leprous boys. At the latter,
says the Jurors, there is a forlorn and
uncared-for atmosphere, and the
grounds and buildings of the Institu
tion are positively dirty. It Is urged
that the Institution be moved to a
more desirable locality, possibly in the;
vicinity of the girls' home, and that
the two homes be run by the same
"management that governs the girls'
home.
Praise for Or. Schwallie.
Considerable credit should be given
to Dr. Scnwallie, the Jurymen declare,
for the efficient manner in which he
is handling the difficult situation
brought about by the crowded condi
tion at4the Insane asylum. Two very
urgent ' needs of the institution are
pointed out in the report; first, that
the overcrowded condition be relieved,
and, second, the introduction of some
light occupation for the inmates who
are able to work. The conclusion
reached by the inquisitors is that there
are quite a few patients, both male
and female, whose condition might be
greatly Improved by having some light
duties to occupy their hands and
minds. Some formof amusement also
would be acceptable, the report says.
Except to make the suggestion that
more money might be provided to sup
ply a few luxuries to make the lives
of the inmates pleasanter, the Jurors'
report has no recommendations for or
criticism of the detention camp at Ka
lihL. - The management Is perfect, the
report declares. tand the Jurymen are
unanimous In their appreciation of the
work of Dr. H. T. Hollman and his as
sociates.
The grand Jury did not visit the set
tlement at Molokal this year, oui tne
members of the tribunal say- that they
have every reason to belteve that the
same efficient care is exercised at that
institution as was seenat the Kalihi
detention camp.
More Pay for Firemen.
The addition of a few men at each
station, and the paying of higher
wages to the fire-lighters, are' recom
mendations made by the Jury in com
menting on the city's fire department
Other recommendations include the
putting of the entire department on a
motor basis, extensive repairs to the
Maklkt station,, the erection of a new
station on the Mauna Kea street lot
and one In Manoa valley, and the ex
tension of the department further into

Mr. Wilson Possibly Will Speak

Associated Press by Federal Wireless
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 10. Vig
orous efforts are being made and
planned by the national administration
to impress upon Congress and the
country that the administration's pro
gram of military and naval expansion
is Justified by its view of the facts. '
It was learned today that the pre
sident will possibly put the question
of national defense before the coun
try in a series of speeches. In. order
to assist in getting the necessary leg
islation through Congress. Many cit
ies are inviting the president to speak

. That the administration - and the
military experts are working together
to secure enlarged defense facilities
was further apparent today when Gen.
Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff of the
army, testified before one of the con
gressional military committees. In the
event of war the United States would
need an army of from one to two mil

21 Reasons; Say Liliuoka

That It does not appear that Dele

right, title or claim to all or any of
the property of Queen Lilluokalanl;
that the delegate does not appear to
have had any right to institute a suit
in behalf of the queen, and that the
suit Instituted was without the approv

among the reasons given by W. O.
Smith, Curtis P. Iaukea and S. M. Da

Trust why they believe the suit
brought by Kuhio to set aside the
Queen's trust should be dismissed
The trustees of the Liliuokalan:

afternoon a demurrer to Delegate Ku

upon which they believe the suit to
break the trust in which the Queen'
property is held should be dismissed.
Kuhio Would Be Heir.
One of the salient reasons for the
dismissal Is the contention that, if the
trust deed is set aside as prayed in the
delegate's petition, then the delegate,
as he claims, wuold be next of kin to
and sole heir at law of the Queen, and

CITY'S BUDOn
"Do Not Want to Go to Jai
June 30," Says Shingle;
Many Cuts Made
Seven, very earnest city supervisors
were at work on the 19616 budget this
afternoon in the assembly room at the
city hall. They began the meeting this
afternoon at 12:15 o'clock, and finish
ed at 2:30.,
After much discussion the genera
fund appropriations were passed at
1285,340, with the exception of a fund
for the courts which has not yet bean
definitely decided upon..
Ml take it that we do not all want to
go to Jail on June 30." said Robert
W. Shingle, half jokingly, as he moved
for the withdrawal of $300 from the
donation of $350 to the children's hos
pital, "and we've got to save every
where we possibly can." None of the
others laughed at the joke about the
ail, however.
.. We've got a millstone about our
necks,".-said William Larsen soon
after. Just previous to this Larsen
had moved for a donation of $150
month for the Promotion Committee
instead of $250. The motion was sec
onded by Shingle, but both withdrew
their proposals when Logan suggested
that the budget had better be passed
as it now stands.
"We are holding up everything
now," said Logan, "better that we
should pass the budget paying our
January donations if necessary, and
retrench later in the half-year."
. How to make the sewer department
pay, a thing which it has never yet
done, : formed the basis of consid
eration at a late hour this afternoon.
Chairman Larsen suggested that
the rates be raised or that consumers
who do not pay for sewer privileges be
shut off from the sewer mains. .
Secret Session Sunday.
.Meeting in secret session yesterday
from 9 o'clock In the morning until
5 o'clock in the afternoon, the super
visors held earnest consultation over
their J916 expenditures, and when
the assembly broke up the former
proposed budget was : shaven 'and
shorn. The budget as it stands to
day ready for adoption Into the muni
cipal fold is less by about $80,000 than
the appropriation bill - of last year.
Assuming that there were over
appropriations of $147,000 to meet,
and that; the July bill should f be the
same as the January one, the total
for this year would be $77,979.75 over
the estimated revenue. This meant
that one-half of the excess stated
should have to be trimmed off the de
mands for the six months ending June
30, or $38,989.87.
Water Appropriation Rescinded.
It was decided to rescind the resolu
tion appropriating $20,000 for a water
investigation. . Then came an appro
priation of the entire balance of cir
cuit court expenses for 18 months,
lately made by special resolution on
the advice of the first deputy attor-
