WATER SHUT OFF
BV A NEW BREAK
A second collapse Sunday nijjht of the wooden pipr line
supplying Seattle with water front the Cedar river dam intensi
fied the possibilities of a general water famine.
Parts of the city are already without water There i>
no chance of repairs completed now before Tuesday
noon. < )fficials fear further cave-ins
Four hours after the 150-foot collapse had been repaired,
at 7 :M) Sunday night, the second break occurred. About 70
feet of the pipe, than a mile below the fir't break,
crumpled.
The water ha<i been turned on and \va< scheduled to reach
Seattle at 3 a. in. Monday morning. It was turned off imme
diately. The crew that had been working day and night since
Thursday was quickly reassembled under the direction of
Superintendent L. B. Youngs.
The districts south of Yesler way and east of Rainier
ave., Madrona Heights, Beacon Hill, Capitol Hill and the
Kainier valley are without water and will not be supplied
before Tuesday noon at the earliest
Makeshift emergency service was rushed Sunday and
Monday.
Heven big auto trucka carried loads of empty barrels thru Ihe dry
districts Seventy of them had been distributed Sunday. One hun
dred more were tak<Mi out Monday morning
They are placed on street corners and filled with water from six
water wagons that have been pressed Into service.
The greate'l danger, according to officials, is from the lack of
water In hospitals and other Institutions that need large quantities for
the hollers of their heating apparatus.
Officials in the water department said Monday that there was no
I 'anger of a lark of water In low districts, or In the extra high dis
tricts, where water Is pumped, for at least ten days
In case of further breaks aunt llary pumping stations, now con
nected up, are ready 1o start puin plug l.ake Washington water Into
the mains.
This, however, would necesslt ale health precautions, such as boil
ing the water.
About half of Seattle wa» being
