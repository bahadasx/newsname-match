New York. Jan. 10. Six ot the
eleven former directors of the New

Jury waa discharged. Tha final rote
on the five defendants upon whom the
jurors could not agree stood eight to
four for acquittal
R. U Batta. chief counssl for the
government, announced that In due
time be would move for a new trial
of theae five. Thla will be done, he
said, before any effort to try tha six
other former directors ot tha road who
obtained aeparate trials.
The Jurors did not reach their ver
dict until after they had reported to
Judge Hunt earlier In tha day that
they could not agree. I'p to that time
noon they had been deliberating
with a view to bringing In a verdict oa
the guilt or Innocence of the defend
ants collectively. The court then In
structed them to mske further efforts
to concur, and that If they could not
agree upon all, to try and reach a
decision on some. The rote on the
question of all at that time atood
eight to four (or acquittal. It was
learned.
Oa returning to the Jury room, the
Jurors unanlmoualy eliminated six de
fendants. Two ot the four Jurors, who
had voted against the defendants orig
Inally, stood firm, however, agslnst
tha remaining five. Then the other
'two Jurors switched to their original
position, leaving eight to four aa the
final verdict
