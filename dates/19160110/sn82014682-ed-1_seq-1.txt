COIIIITIf lAIL LAXITY, lEtllBICY' OF
: JUDGES DEHOUM BY JURORS
Territorial Tribunal in Comprehensive Reports Gives Result of
Probe Into Many Local Affairs During 1915 Investigation
of "Jack" McGrath's Escape and Fred Gough's Story De
tailed Sentences Passed By Courts Criticized Boys' In
dustrial School and Road Conditions Get Emphatic Comment
In one of the most comprehensive and far-reaching reports ever re-,
dered by a territorial grand Jury, the administration of the county Jail Is
vigorously criticized and Sheriff Charles II. Hose Is held reHponsible. The
ronclualona of the grand Jury, reached after a year of work, were given,
to Circuit Judge Clarence W. Ashford at 10 o'clock this morning by t ore-,
man James II. Fiddes. . , . , .
Ilaslng Its findings on some of the Btorles told by I red Cough, former
inmate of the Jail, and others, first brought to the attentiouof the public
by the Star-Bulletin, the grand jury declares that the sheriff shouldhave
zeroised greater care regarding the men, and that laxity exist at t",
city and county lock-up. ' " ' -: '-
The reiort as presented is a type
written document of 70 pages, of which
21 are given over to statistics regard-
in tr jail sentences and paroles. The
other 29 pages represent one of the
most exhaustive probes into and sur
veys of public affairs in the city and
Vounty of Honolulu that any official
body has ever conducted.
The grand Jurors, in one drastic sec
tion of their report, point out what
they declare is an "excess of leniency"
on the part of the territorial courts,
and state emphatically that the double
purpose of the law Is most "woe
fully forgotten." They declare that
penalties should be such as to deter
others from crime, and point out also
that serious crimes such as embezzle
ment and robbery are prevalent to a
Btartlmg degree. The granting of pa
roles la also criticized.
Embezzlement Are Serioua.
MWe view wfth alarm," the jurors
says, "the prevalence of embezzle
ment, as shown by the Increased num
ber of Indictments returned by us dur
ing the past year under this heading.
Tills Increase has had very serious
consideration by us and we have en
deavored to ascertain If we could not
make some recommendations to safe
guard both employer end employe."
They add that, from their Investiga
tion s, they have found that embezzle
ment has been made possible by lax
supervision.
Before taking up the more weighty
matters such Attfc county Jail, boys'
induitliarrctrool, r6att and theaters;
tie-grand Jttrcra devote a part of their
report to investigations of various pub
. lie institutions in and abont the city.
The. veniremen declare they are fa.
vorabIy. impresses with conditions at
" the liome forjnon-leprout girls, and the
i work of tho slater of charity in car
ing for the Inmates. It is urged that
more money be given the institution,
for the principal reason that Improve
ments to the grounds may. be carried
out ,
A contrast is noted In the report be.
tween the girls' home and the home
for non-leprous boys. At the latter,
says the jurors, there is a forlorn and
uncared-for atmosphere, and the
grounds and buildings of the institu
tion are positively dirty. It is urged
that, the Institution be moved to a
more desirable locality, possibly in the
vicinity of the girls home, and that
the two homes be run by the same
management that governs the girls'
home. "... v .' -",--' '
Praise for Dr. Schwallie.
Considerable credit should be given
to Dr. Schwallie, the jurymen declare,
for the efficient manner In which he
Is handling the difficult situation
brought about by the crowded condi
tion at the insane' asylum. Two very
urgent needs of -the institution are
pointed out in the report; first, that
the overcrowded condition be relieved,
and, second, the introduction of some
light occupation for the inmates who
are able to work. The conclusion
reached by the inquisitors is that there
are quite a few patients, both male
and female, whose condition might be
greatly Improved by having some light
duties to. occupy their hands and
minds. Some form of amusement also
would be acceptable, the report says.
Except to make the suggestion that
more money might be provided to sup
ply a few luxuries to make the lives
of the inmates pleasanter, the Jurors'
report has no recommendations for or
criticism of the detention camp at Ka
lihi. The management Is perfect, the
report declares, and the jurymen are
unanimous in their appreciation of the
work of Dr. H. T. Hollman and his as-
The grand Jury did not visit the set
tlement at Molokai this year, but the
members of the tribunal say that they
have every reason to believe that, the
same efficient care is exercised at that
institution as was seen at the Kalihl
detention camp.
More Pay for Firemen.
The addition of a few men at each
station, and the paying of higher
wages to the fire-fighters, are recom
mendations made by the jury in com
menting on the city'a fire department
Other recommendations include the
putting of the entire department on a
motor basis, extensive repairs to the
Makikl station, the erection of a new
station on the Mauna Kea street lot
and one in Manoa valley, and the ex
tension of the department further into

Meeting in secret session yesterday
from 9 o'clock in the morning until
5 o'clock in the afternoon, the super
visors held earnest consultation over
thpir 1916 expenditures, and wnen
ti nutpmbiv broke ud 'he : former
nrrmoKed budget was shaven and
shorn. The budget as it stands to
ri a r readv for adoption Into the muni
cipal fold Is less by about $80,000 than
the appropriation bill oi last year.
AMiimhmr that there were over-
uppropriatlons of $147,000 to meet
and that the July bill should be the
same as the Ainuary one, the total
tor this year would be $77,979.75 over
the estimated revenue. This ; meant
that one-half,, of ; the excess stated
should tawt to be trimmed off the de

Appropriation Rescinded; ' !
it was decided to rescind the resolu
tion appropriating $20,000 for a water
investigation. Then, came an appro
priation of the entire balance of cir
cuit court expenses for 18 months,
lately made by special resolution on
the advice of the first deputy attor
ney. As only one-third of the amount
could fairly be charged against the
current six months, two-thirds of tlte
item was cut out
Nextan extra $600 a month to Koo

district being taken care of In the
belt road arrangement, with part of
Its small road taxes reserved for can
tonier work. The Honolulu police item
was reduced $2500, still leaving the
sheriff the additions to the force he
asked. Parks, general fund, was cut
$500 a month.
Honolulu roads maintenance' was
left at $10,000 a month, the same as
for some months past, and all out of
the road tax fund. i
The decision to repeal the water
investigation resolution was not alto

SUFFERERS FROM WAR
A round thousand dollars, given by

ed within a few days to the Guaranty
Trust Company of New York City ex
rressly for Polish relief. The money
now Is in the hands of James A. Rath,
secretary-treasurer of the local War
Relief Committee.
The first appeal for relief for the
menu, women and children of war-ridden
Poland -reached Hawaii only a
short time ago and the money now in
hand for this purpose shows that the
response in Hawaii has been speedy
and generous. Mr. Rath reports that
to date, about $80,000, has .been sent
out from Hawaii to assist war suffer
ers in various parts of Europe.
NEW ALARM SYSTEM
AT POLICE STATION
Honolulu police will use the same
system for "checking in" and report
ing fires that is used in nearly all
cities on the coast when the new
Gamewell system, now being installed
in the police station, is ready lor use.
The indicators w ill be set in the rooms
which have heretofore been used for
the examination of -detained prison
ers, and by the captains and provost
guard. New flooring will be put in
this week under supervision of Build

The new system is arranged to pro

and is large enough to accommodate
all which may be put In in the future,
