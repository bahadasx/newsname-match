WASHINGTON, I). ('., Jan. 10.
—The greatest personal political
feud In the history of this nation!
Has the stage already been set j
for such a drßiua and the curtain
rung up before an audience of
100,000,000 Americans?
People in the heart of national
politics here say so; they declare i
that President Woodrow WII3OII
und Theodore Roosevelt already
have begun the first act in a po
litical "thriller" that, for bitter
personal feeling, will exceed any
ever enacted on our national plat
form.
Many Side Issues, To".
And they foresee that the sub
ordinate political quarrels th.it
will cluster about such a resound
ing feud—the spilt between Wil
son and Bryan, the cleavage be
tween T. R. and the Tuft faction
and the hostility between Bry.m
and Champ ('lark—will only
serve to Increase the din of :he
great battle.
The first episodes, although
they have not, in the public mind,
fallen Into a dramatic whole, al
ready have been widely notice
able; indeed many Americans
have been openly surprised by
the animosity and personality of
Roosevelt's recent attacks on
Wilson.

The navy's general board and
the army's war college have de
manded, for the security of the
greater pan-American doctrine,
these things:
We Need
a Rhodes
America needs a Cecil Rhodes or a greater
than Cecil Rhodes.
Will Montevideo or Rio Janeiro or some
other Latin-American center furnish this
continent a man big enough to vision this
continent's proper future?
# * »
Our poor idea is something like this:
A great international congress of all the
Pan-American nations-a congress of repre
sentative delegates of all the American re
publics—and enlargement of the present
Pan-American union that should have an of
ficial standing and should unify the various
nations as our government at Washington
unifies the various states.
Let this congress meet, say, every two
years—first in Rio Janeiro, then in Mexico
City, next in Santiago de Chile, then in
Washington, and finally in Buenos Aires—
and let its acts within a certain defined
range be binding on the American republics
just as the acts of our Washington con
gresses are binding on the North American
states.
This certainly isn't asking too much of the
continent that could produce a union of the
discordant states that overthrew the British
yoke—or unions of tha scattered Spanish
colonies.
Then in the far future our children's chil
dren will speak of the "21 original repub
