PRESS RECEIVES POOR
TREATMENT WITH FORD
The Hague, Jan. 10.-On account
of the shortage of hotel accommoda
tions, fifty newspaper correspondents
with the Ford peace party have been
quartered in a Dutch sanitarium.
There they are not permitted to use
tobacco or liquor.
The food is meatless and consists
of nuts, cereal, queer vegetables. The
guards are impressive to enforce
regulations.
This is the result of Madamme
Schwimmer's orders on account of
the correspondents reporting various
rows among the peace delegates.
The meetings of the peace party
are for some reasons held under the
auspices of the Royal Zoological and
Botanyeal Society insteal of under
the auspices of peace societies.
