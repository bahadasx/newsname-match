Blocked by St. Paul Tracks Engine Smoke
Damages Houses and Trees.
A horrible stench came from a big,
black, windowless building standing
at 52d av. and the St-Paul railroad
tracks and was wafted by the wind
down on a group of men who were
talking excitedly and pointing at the
railroad embankment When it
reached them they coughed and
sputtered. Some looked sick. All
chewed on cigars in an effort to dull
their sense of smell.
"Ugh!" exclaimed 'one of the men.
"What is that?"
u "That is'fieom the Northwestern
Malting Co.," answered another.
"Smells rotten, doesn't it? Well, we.
have tried for years to get the health
department to take action here and
they have done nothing. You should
smell the plant in summer. Thou
sands of people have been made
deathly sick from It in one night"
The group comprised committee of
Northwest Side business men and
property owners who were endeav
oring to show a committee from the
board of local improvements and-Aid.
