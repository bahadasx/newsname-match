paper moil arriving in this city with
the Ford peace cxpeilition are being
housed in a Sanataritini. the hotels all
being tilled to their capacity.
Madame Uosiku Scliwimmer is be
ing charged by the disgruntled press
men with making the arrangements
for their abode. I'nder the rules of
the sanatorium, meats, liquor and to
bacco are barred.
A caucus bold among the journalists
came to the decision that the move
was one of revenge for articles sent
back to the states depicting the rows
which occurred on the Oscar II.
Tlie true tale of tlie war among the
pacifists on the Oscar II is told by
Charles I". Stewart. United Press Cor
respondent, in tlie last issue of the
Editor and Publisher.
Everything was lovely until S. S.
MeClure read President Wilson's mes
sage from an advance copy be bad
brought with him. The preparedness
muse stirred up considerable feeling
on the ship. The trouble was soothed
over, however, until the night when
Peace Secretary Louis P. Lochner was
scheduled to make an address.
"The correspondents had work to
do." writes Mr. Stewart, "so leaving
Kdward M. Hits of the Brooklyn Eagle
to attend the meeting, they repaired to
the press room.
"Upon them burst, three-quarters of
an hour later, said Wis. with the tid
ings that 'a hell of row was forward
in the smoker.'
"Itefore be had time to particularize
there rushed also into tlie press room
a delegate, swearing that 'that foil
lilauk. another delegate, bar started
all the trouble."
Whereupon it transpired that a
manifesto denouncing the prepared
ness policy had been signed by Kord
and twenty-one of the delegates.
Members of the party tried to pre
vent the newspaper men from putting
the story of the row on the wireless.
The wireless room was locked, but
upon the order of Mr. Kord it was
opened. A little later the wireless
operator was piled up with routine
peace messages. Mr. Kord again inter
vened and told the correspondents they
were first.
"Thirty minutes later a correspond
ent peered into the wireless room."
concludes Stewart. "The operator
was toiling with the Kord messages.
The news dispatches were piled at
nn ciito Secretary Locllticr U3U
countermanded Kord's order.
"In a body the correspondents
rushed to the automobile manufac
turer's stateroom. Explanations fol
lowed. Lochner didn't know of the
Kord order. Not he!"

I'lUIIM) COLLEGE MEN I'KEI'AKE
'rinceliiii President, Says That N'mii
lier Could Fight in Case of War.
Approximately 20,000 college men
are in readiness to take the field
should the I'nited States become in
volved in war, declared Dr. John Grier
Hibbcn, president of Princeton uni
versity, in an oddress at New York
City Saturday before the Republican
Club.
These young men, be said, are in a
state of preparedness because of the
military training they have received
in college. He said the presumption
that America could raise a voluntary"
army of a million men between sunrise
and sunset is sheer nonsense and that
war would be simply butchery of our
young men who are untrained for mil
itary service.
I'nited States Senator George 1..
Chamberlain advocated military
training in this country, declaring it
would rebound to the physical well
being of the youth, even if there were
no war. He said there should be a
standing army sufficient to garrison
our insular possessions, as well as to
man our fortifications. He called at
tention to the fact that nearly all the
Japanese in this country are reservists
and had had military training.

said last night that he had reached no j
decision, though he has been urged
by St. I.ouis Republican leaders to en

Should the St. Louis mayor decide
to run, it is expected that many as
pirants now in the field would with
draw. Kiel will not become a candi
date for delegate-at-large to the Re

situation.

Walter W. Garth ' Wat" Garth, as
the older residents of Columbia af

He attended Christian and Stephens
colleges in the years when small boys
were enrolled as pupils there and
later was a student in the 1'niversity.
In 187:: he was admitted to the bar but
public office and business interests
took him out of active practice of the
profession.
Judge Garth had always a keen in
terest in politics, lie was a staunch
Democrat and participated in many
conventions and conferences of his
party. He filled with acceptability a
number of public offices. He was for
eight years, 1S74 to I SSL', circuit clerk
and recorder of Boone County. He
served as member and chairman of
the City Council, lie was appointed to
the office of judge of probate of Boone
County in 1 S!1! by Governor David R.

Mrs. II. I. liragg of Columbia.
Judge Garth was one of the most
popular citizens of Columbia. l'roba-
bly no one had a wider circle of ac
quaintances and friends. His unfail
ing good humor and cheeriness, his
charitableness and gentleness of
speech, his generosity, his large and
constant interest in community life in
its highest and best forms brought
him universal respect and affection.
Few men counted more largely in the
life of Columbia or will be more

APPEAL IMPROBABLE,
STARRETT DECLARES
City Attorney Says He Has
Always Doubted Legality
of Cigarette Ordinance.
WOULD DROP CASE
Mayor Batterton, Too, I
Averse to Spending Money
in Losing Cause.
It is not probable that the city will
appeal from the decision of Judge
Samuel Davis in tlie ISoojie County
Circuit Court, declaring the anti-cigarette
ordinance invalid. This state
ment was made by City Attorney
George S. Starrett this morning.
Mr. Starrett said that from the be
ginning of the agitation he had doubt
ed the legality of the measure. He
said that the state had made pro
visions governing cigarettes and that
the city could not pass an ordinance
not consistent with the state statutes.
"When the council passed the or
dinance," said Mr. Starrett, "I was
obliged to give it my support until it
was passed upon by a court of com
petent jurisdiction. As the question
has been decided in the Circuit Court,
I do not think the city will push the
matter further."
-Mayor J. M. liatterton said that if
the city could find any indication that
the measure was legal the case would
be appealed. However, he said the
city must be absolutely certain of its
ground and avoid spending the city's
money in a losing cause. He again
stated that he favored the ordinance.
MLLS TWO PEEK WITH ONE .SHOT
Ambassador Gerard Slums II Killer's
Marksmanship to Germans.
ItV CARL W. ACKEUMAN
(United Press StatT Correspondent.)
BERLIN, Dec. HI (by mail). Out
hunting today with the American mil
itary attache in Ilerlin, Colonel Rutins,
Ambassador Gerard killed two small
deer with o..e shot. The Colonel, on
the other hand, tired two shots without
hitting a deer.
Did Gerard's friends not know that
he was an expert-crack-never-miss-an-aim
rilleman. they would think this
an accident, but this is the second
time this winter that Gerard has
killed two deer with one shot. Today
it happened thus:
Gerard and the colonel went out to
the ambassador's game preserve near
Ilerlin. Two small deer appeared.
Gerard fired at one. The bullet went
through its heart, struck a rib, glanced
out the side and went through the sec
ond. More game appeared and the of
ficer took a shot and another shot,
but the deer disappeared.
On their way home Gerard decided
he would like to bag a duck for din
ner because Mrs. Gerard's mother is
visiting here and likes duck. It was
dark. Tlie ambassador spotted one,
fired and bagged it. Hut when he got
it home it was too old to eat.
"That's what I get for shooting
ducks at night." remarked Gerard
smilingly when he reached the em
bassy. KNAPP lU'RIED

Judge Harris Gives Some
Advice as to Business
Methods.
Anyone who cashes a $1 check for a
raggedly dressed negro boy, who from
his appearance indicates that he has
no bank account, and then seeks pro
tection from the law- in the courts
and causes taxpayers expense, need
expect no sympathy from Judge David
II. Harris of the Boone County Circuit
Court.
C. O. Selders, proprietor of the New
York Store, found that out this after
noon. Thursday Charley Turner, a
negro 13 years old, cashed a check
at the New York Store. The boy had
no funds and Mr. Selders had W. M.
Dinwiddie, prosecuting attorney, file
state charges against the youth. In
Circuit Court this afternoon Turner
pleaded guilty and was sentenced
to tlie Missouri reform school at
Uoonville until he becomes of age.
After passing sentence on the boy.
Judge Harris called Mr. Selders to the
courtroom and furnished the only
thrill of the day's session In his lec
ture to tlie Columbia merchant.
"Why didn't you telephone the bank
and protect yourself before cashing
this boy's check?" the Judge queried.
"From the negro's appearance one
could easily see that he had no money,
but instead you cashed the check and
expected the courts to protect you.
"It will cost the taxpayers of Boone
County JS00 to keep this negro in the
reform school until he is 21. You
could easily have avoided this ex
pense. The courts are not for this
sort of thing."
After Judge Harris' lecture . Mr.
Selders said that he didn't know
whether he or the negro boy was being
sentenced.

of tlie workers are in the frame of
mind they are in now," President
Campbell said, "and we will not at
tempt to resume operations for sev
eral days at least. There are work
men now- lu the plant and more will
be put to work if they apply. Our fur
naces are still banked, but steam is
being kept in the boilers in order to
keep the pipes from freezing."
President Campbell said that many
workmen had informed the company
that they desired to return to work
but. were afraid, as their families had
been threatened.
