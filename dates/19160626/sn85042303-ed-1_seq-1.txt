5 Washington, D. C, June 26.
I Whether a state of war shall
exist between the United States
and Mexico, depends on the
formal policy of declaration by
Carranza. which is expected
hourly in response to the note
sent yesterday. The note also
demanded the release of the
seventeen prisoners at Chihua
hua. Although Captain Korey's
letter indicated that the Ameri
cans were responsible to some
extent for the Carrizal clash,
this has no particular bearing
on the present situation.
! No plans have been made
for Wilson's address to a joint
session of congress.

I Note Delivered by Rodgers

may be expected.

Washington, June 26. Formal in
quiry of six Latin-American republics
was made to Arredondo today as to
whether Carranza would accept media
tion offers.
Mexico ' Accepts Mediation.
Washington, June 26. Eliaeo Arre
dondo, Carranza's Washington repre
sentative, announced here last night
that Carranza has accepted "in prin
ciple" the offer of the Central and
South American republics to mediate
between the United States and Mex
ico. Movement of Troops Begins.
New York, June 26. The movement
of the national guard from the eastern
department toward the border begins
today. Fourteen regiments, including
all branches of the service, are under
orders from General Wood to start
before night.
Carranza Accepts Responsibility.
Washington, June 26. The United
States yesterday demanded of the Car
ranza government the immediate re
lease of the American troopers taken
prisoners at Carrizal, and that an early
statement of the intentions of the
Carranza government is expected.
The note to Mexico disclosed that the
state department received Saturday a
communication from the de facto
government stating that the Carrizal
fight was the direct result of orders
to attack the American soldiers, mov
ing otherwise than toward the border,
personally issued by Carranza to Gen
eral Trevino and by the latter com
municated to Pershing.
In his reply, Secretary Lansing re
quires the de facto government to
transmit a definite statement "as to
the course of action it has determined
upon," through the usual diplomatic
channels and "not through subordi
nate military officers."
The Mexican communication is con
strued as a formal avowal of delib
erately hostile action against the for
ces of the United States now in Mex
ico and of the purpose to attack with
out provocation whenever they move
from their present position, despite
the friend mission on which tliey are
engaged, and which is reaffirmed In
the American rejoinder. General Car
ranza is required to place himself on
record formally and the plain intima
tion lies behind the restrained lang
uage in Lansings' communication that
force will be met with force. Appar
ently, however, the Washington gov
ernment i3 determined that the de
facto government sh-ll not evade re
sponsibility before the world, if war
is forced upon the United States.
Orders Militiamen South.
Washington, June 26. Fifteen thou
sand national guardsmen from the
states of New York, Massachusetts,
New Jersey and Connecticut, were or
dered last night to entrain at once for
the Mexican border. Some of the mil
itiamen are expected to be en route
to Mexico tonight.
Quiet Sunday in Mexico.
El Paso, Tex., June 26. Quiet pre
vailed in Juarez Sunday and it was
nounced at the Mexican consulate that
reports from the interior showed the
inactivity of the Mexican troops at
Villa Ahumada. and other points.

REPORTS FROM FRONT INDICATE
HIGHEST MORALE AMONG THE
MEN.
BIG MOIOB TRAINS
Long Line of Motor Cars Stand Ready
For the Order to Advance Not a
Wounded or Incapacitated Man at
the Front With Pershing's Army.
El Paso, Tex., June 26. General
Pershing's erstwhile punitive expedi
tion in Mexico, twelve thousand strong
is ready for any action, if action is
necessary.
His southern outpost, according to
the best information, is near El Valle,
fifty miles from Colonia Dublan, the
Mexican base.
Reports from the front indicate the
highest morale among the men. The
equipment is in the best of condition,
the horses and mules have been test
ed, big motor trains, loaded with sup
plies, are lined up ready for the ad
vance. Every empty motor truck at
Columbus has been sent to the front
for infantry transport, and not a
wounded or incapacitated, man is with
the force in Mexico.
It was feared today that some action
by a subordinate Mexican commander
might precipitate hostilities before the
Washington-Mexico City exchanges
are completed. ;
Captain Morey is Safe.
San Antonio, Tex., June 26. Left to
die of loss of blood and thirst two
miles from the scene of the Carrizal
battle, Captain Morey of the Tenth
cavalry has made his way back to the
American lines. General Funston last
night received a telephone message
from Mrs. Morey at Austin, saying she
had received the following wireless
from the field:
"Somewhere in Mexico. Am back
on the line with two men, safe." Mrs.
Morey is confident the message was
from her husband.
