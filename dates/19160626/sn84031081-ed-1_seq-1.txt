tierce fighting between the Mexicans
and American8 at Columbus. At the
time this article is written it is not

But at any rate as soon as .Mr. Sadler
heard it he turned in his star to the
city, hunted up the recruiting officer
and Joined Company K, New Mexico
national guard, which has been at Co
lumbus for more than a month. Mr.
Sadler has a grown son who is also a

Mr. sndler has been night police
man here for the past three years. He
Is tl feet 4 inches in height, weighs

that the de facto government transmit

a formal avowal of deliberately hus

United Slates now in Mexico, and of
the put pore to attack without provo

friendly mission on which they are
engaged and which Is reafllrmcd in

General Carranza Is reiiuired to
place himself on record formally, and
the plain intimation Ins behind the
restrained language of Mr Ijinsiug's
