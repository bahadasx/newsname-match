NBW YORK, June It.—Theo
dore Roosevelt's letter to the na
tional progressive committee was
made public here today.
It contains an unqualified en
dorsement of Hughes' candidacy,
a scathing arraignment of tlvj
Wilson administration, -ml an
urgent request to progressives to
support the republican candidate.
"It has become entirely evi
dent," the letter declares, "that
the people under existing condi
tions are not prepared to accept
a new party. Under *.'ieli cir
cumstances, our duty is to do the
best we can antl not to a.ilk be
cause our leaderhsip is rejected.
"It would be a grave detriment
to the country to re-ol';ct Mr.
Wilson. 1 shall therefore strong
ly support Mr. Hughes. Sach be
ing the case, It is unnecessary
to say that I cannot accept tho
nomination on a third lic.tet. I
do not believe there should be a
third ticket."

Recruits wanted In Tacoma.
Not recruits of flesh nnd blood

Preparedness wins. The spirit

And because of all this, the

Clf Mexico insists on going to war with
. the United Slates tin* American people
will pick uj) the gauntlet regretfully but with
item firmness to see the husiness through.
We say regretfully because the mass of Amer
icans recognise in the Mexicans A PEOPLE
WHO KNOW NOT WHAT THEY DO. Po*
nearly 400 years they have been the victims of
kings, bestial nobles, money-grabbers, land
owners, foreign capitalists and every educated
native freebooter who was able to raise himself
above the vest in that land of richness. If
not a written principle of government, it was
an understood rule that the people were to be
kepi down, deprived of education, held in a
yoke that was not far from slavery,
C IGNORANCE has been the direct result
—appalling national IGNORANCE and
its TWIN DEVIL, FANATICISM! The Mex
ican, in his ignorance, cannot understand, can
not realize the benevolent attitude of this na
tion towards his country for three long, bard,
trying years. As a people, we don't want to
fight and kill Mexicans. As a people we sym
pathize with them in their efforts to rise to
civilization by overthrowing, in blood antl suf
fering, the things that make for ignorance,
poverty and degradation.
CAs president of the well-wishing Ameri
can people, Woodrow Wilson has kept
the bandl of other powerful nations oft the
Mexicans —has kept our dogs of war leashed
when our own exploiters, land-grabbers and
capitalistic freebooters shrieked at him to let
them loose. The United States could have in
tervened a hundred times hut held back, hop
ing and praying that Mexico would rise by her
self from the flames of revolution to peace, to a
purified nationalism, to a realization of her re
sponsibilities, within and without.
C History will praise our patience and laud
our good intentions. But Mexico's lead
ers for the moment —her native freebooters nf
the day, Carranza, Villa, Trevino and the rest
—are driving the ignorant people to the preci
pice. For the sake of power and pelf, they are
playing politics with the flesh and blood and
souls of their countrymen.
CWe have been patient to the end. We
can do no more. If we must fight, we
will fight and we will not cease until the pac
ification of Mexico and the peace of our own
bolder is assured. As a people we go into
this war with no lust. We covet no territory,
we will kill with no joy. Duty alone spurs
us to whatever now comes. And (lod help us

Border Watches Pershing
EL PASO, Tex., June 26.—
Convinced that war Is inevitable,
Interest along the border Is cen
tered on the withdrawal of the
American expedition's advanced
base from Namiqulpa to El
Valle.
Private advices saying Persh

toward E) Valle are believed un
true.
It will be composed of 1.1 di
visions and at least half a dozen
bands. Here's their order: Fed
eral, state and city employes; war
veterans' organizations and pa
triotic societies; mercantile men,
transportation men, fraternal or
ganizations and professlouel men;
out-of-town visitors; nninfactur
ers, traders , millers, lumbermen,
bankers, Insurance men, real es

schools: the women; military or
ganizations; autos carrying Taoo
ma's old soldiers.
The marshals of the various di
visions met at noon today at the
Cemmerclal club to complete the
plans for the parade.
Military officers believe Car
ranx.a cannot yield to Wilson's
ultimatum without being deposed
and meeting the fate of Madero.
Gen. Bell has pitched his
camps at El Paso so as to pre
vent a surprise attack from any
quarter. There are fewer than
300 soldiers at Juarez, but a

MUNITION
SHIPMENT
EXPECTED
By D'Loss Sutherland
During th? downpour of rain,
Col. Inglls called an officers' as
sembly today antl gave the offi
cers the first serious talk of the
present campaign.
The ceremony was impressive.
The colonel talked low and the
usual twinkle and half snjile that
usually marks his face was ab
sent.
He impressed them with the
serious obligations to 'h?lr gov
ernment, to their state, and to
their troops.
He Insisted that their health
and general welfare must be
watched above all.
Remember Dependents.
Ortlers were issued to the cap
tains of the Seattle companies for
a list of married men mi others
who had person dependent on |
them. Thse names will be sent
to various Seattle commercial or
ganizations antl the families of
the soldiers will be loo3"d after. |
('apt. Ross, camp adjutant, said
that practically every troop had
been equipped. The ordnuice sup
plies, including the arms and am
munition, ar«! expected at the ar
senal today.
"All of the troops have bt)<M
federalized," Capt. Ross said.
"There is a possibility they may
be put through a formal musler
later on, but for the present tho
new oath is sufficient."
Adj. Gen. Thompson arrived at.
tamp today. It was not learned
at a late hour, if he had any par
ticular instructions regarding the
movement of the troops.
Rumors that iroop B :.nd com
pany A, signal corps, have be.-sn
ordered to proceed to the border
as soon as they receive their
mounts were dispelled today wh?n
Capt. Palmer and staff officers
of the adjutant's camp were ques
tioned.
Capt. Palmer said that there
would be a thousand different ru
mors circulated within the next
few days, but as yet ;ie had ao
definite knowledge when llie
troop would move. At present
the men are more or less incapaci
tated from recent shots :>f small
pox antitoxlne.
The field infirmary, 'onsisting
of four officers and 24 men, uas
pitched tents near troop B.
All to lull Strength.
Revllle awakened the entire
camp shortly after daybreak _iud
one of the busiest days of the
camp began. A steady downpour
did not effect the activity.
Two infantry companies from
Spokane and a machine ]U com
pany arrived at Cosgrove shortly
after 7 o'clock today. They im
mediately put up their Pints. VII
companies were recruited to full
fighting strength.
There Is considerable rivalry
between the various companies as
to the patriotism shown when
they left their various homes. The
Seattle troops say 6."i,000 persons
lined the streets wbtM they
marched to the train. A news
paper man said that Seattle for
got itself and went wild.
North Yakima troops say their
march to the station was over a
bed of roses.
Enthusiastic citizens took up
donations and contributed $1,1.00
to the mess funds of the two Yak
ima companies.
Centralia did not let its boyi
go unforgotten. More than $600
was contributed ot the :iess fund
of company M. This lody, too,
marched down the streets to pa
triotic airs amidst a shower of
roses.

If war Is declared.
El Paso expects that 20,000
militiamen will be stationed In

among the forces coming hero.

day tared a Jury in his trial for

England's first high treason
trial, with two exceptions, for 6:' i

Not since Parnell, Irish party
leader in parliament, successfully
defied the London Times, in
1887. to prove charges of traitor

Capt. Morey Found
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., June 26
—Captain Lewis Morey, com
mander of troop X, who i-.ent the
first official account of the Car
rizal battle, has been found.
He Is lying wounded at the

prising tho two troops, 4 3 havo
returned to the American lln?,

hua, leaving 2 2 unaccounted for.
It Is believed that practically all
of the accused, and the responsi
bility for the sentence then
passes to the judge or judges.
Accompanied by a single guard,
the prisoners entered the. court
from a door at the side. Every
eye in the chamber followed the
tall, lean and almost gaunt fig
ure ol" Casement as he stepped to
his place and was seated after ho
had swiftly bowed toward the
justices' bench.
Not awed in the least, tho not
ed defendant quickly looked
about the room and smilingly
nodded to several acquaintances.
lie then picked up a large note
pad and awaltetl proceedings.
His co-defendant, Daniel Julian
Halley, looked neither right nor
left. He almost forgot the for
mality tif bowing to the bench,
and after quickly nodding his
head sat down and folded his
aims, in which position ho re
mained.
In a firm voice. Casement
pleaded not guilty before Chief
Justice Reading and Associate
Justice Avery and Harrlge.
The jury was obtained in less
than an hour.
these were killed.
Gen. Pershing has forwarde 1
the information taken from a
notebook found on the body of
Captain Boyd. The notebook con
tained carbon copies of the note
sent the Mexican comminder at
Carrizal saying the Americans
were on a peaceful inlssl in, and
asking permission to pass through
the town.
The original note from Gen.
Gomez inviting Boyd Into town
for a conference also his been
found. Gen. Pershing commented
that this note "looks like treach
ery."
How Morey escaped Is not
known, but It is supposed ne was
picked up by the rescuing force
ilent out by Gen. Pershing.
