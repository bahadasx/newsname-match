his
ADMIlHSTnATIQll IS DETERMII1ED TO GIVE THE GREASERS
Washington, June 26 War between
the'United States and Mexico depends
upon a formal declaration of policy by
Carranza. A response to the note
Secretary Lansing telegraphed ? to
Mexico City yesterday is expected
hourly.
The immediate release of American
cavalrymen captured at Carrizal will
be insisted uponr Officials explained,
huwever, that the course of the Unit
ed States would be determined large
ly by Carranza's final statement of
his intentions toward the American
expedition.
The war department at noon hadn't
received the letter from Captain
Morey giving the first American ver
sion of the Carrizal fight. Captain
Morey is safe in one of Gen. Per
shing's camps. A complete report of
the engagement is expected soon.
The published text of the letter is
construed as indicating the Americans
were partly responsible for the clash.
The official account from Captain
'Morey, however, will be the basis for
judgment, rather than a hurried note
written by a man expecting death.
The Mexican note saying that Car
ranza personally directed General
Trevino to resist the movements of
American troops is the real issue. The
Washington government construes
this as a formal avowal of deliberate
ly hostile action. Secretary Lansing's
not demands that Carranza state thru
diplomatic channels if this i his pur
pose. RICAUT REMOVED
Laredo, June 26. It is reported un
officially that Carranza has ' removed
General Alfredo Ricaut, commander
of the northeastern Mexican border
patrol, because he failed to attack
the American forces crossing the bor-
der after bandits June 17th. General
Emiliano Nefarette was reinstated. j
A STERN NOTIFICATION I
Washington, June 26. A demand j
for the immediate" release of the
American troopers taken prisonei? at
Carrizalcoupled with a stern notifica
tion that the United States expects an
early statement of the purposes of
the Carranza government, was tele
graphed to Mexico City yesterday by
Secretary Lansing.
I General" Carranza is required to
place himself on record formally, and
the plain intimation lies behind the
restrained language of Mr. Lansing's
communication that force will be met
with force. Apparently, however, the
Washington government is determin
ed that the de facto government shall
not evade responsibility before the
world if far is forced upon the United
Stat3.
CUTTING OFF COMMERCE
Washington, June 26. The admin
istration is planning to extend re
strictions on commerce with Mexico to
ny good 3 of which military use might
e made, pending determination of
uture relations between the two
countries.

Seaboard Air Ljne in Manufacturers'
Record will Promote City as
logical Point for a Large
Packing Plant x
About the last week fh July the
Seaboard Air Line will run in the
Manufacturers' Record, Baltimore, a
full page advertisement setting forth
the fact, that Ocala is the logical
point in Florida for a meat packing
plant. L. R. Trammell, secretary of
the Marion County Board of Trade,
has just been advised of this by B. L.
Hamner, general development agent
of the Seaboard.
Mr. Hamner recently wrote to the
Board of Trade asking for. data for
the advertisement, asking especially
to be informed as to Ocala's greatest
present industrial need, and was in
formed that a packing plant was
wanted.
The copy for the advertisement
which will be published in the Man
ufacturers' Record reads as follows:'
"The United"States government has
in its official publication declared that
in the future the people of the United
States must look to the southeastern
section of the United States for a
reasonable cheap meat supply.
"Florida conditions for beef and
perk production are proven, and Mar
ion county is in the front ranks, and
it is claimed that 250 hogs and 50,000
cattle per annum could be furnished
an uptodate packing plant located at
Ocala the logical Florida point for a
packing house.
"Armour & company are now build
ing a packing plant at Jacksonville.
"The figures upon meat shipments
into that section the cattle ship
ments out of there and the facts
bearing on this situation tell the story.
"If interested in this proposition,
we shall be pleased to help verify the
claims of this section, one of the rich
est general farming and cattle raising
sections in all Florida, and that means
much."

election, and is giving the matter con
sideration. .
A CORRECTION
"Cleanliness is next to Godliness,"
but B. Goldman had begun to believe
that the people of Ocala knew nothing
of this maxim or proverb, for no one
was asking for his special offer on
Octagon soap. He looked at his ad
vertisement again and found that the
printers yere making him offer
cakes of Octagon for 15 cents with
each purchase of $1 or more at his
Adjustment Sale. This should have
read "5 cakes of Octagon soap for 15
cents with each purchase of $1 or
more at this sale, as long as the sup
ply of soap lasts." The offer is now
in force for the balance of this week.

(Associated
El Paso, June 26. Gen. Pershing's
force of about 12,000 men is ready for
action If necessary. According to the
best information here his southern
most outpost is near Elvalle, about
fifty miles from Colonia-Dublan, the
main base. It's believed from Elvalle
a large mobile force may be pointed
eastward in a strategic position to
ward the Mexican Central railroad.
Reports from the front say big
motor trains have been loaded for the
advance. Every available truck at
Columbus has been rushed to the
front. With lines paralleling for at
least 150 miles, rash action by some
subordinate commander, it is con
sidered here, might at any time em
broil the main commands. Command
ers have redoubled their vigilance to
prevent this.

AUTO PRICES MAY SOAR
HIGH SOON, SAYS AGENT
Cost of Material Anvancing and
Therefore Increases in Prices
Are Certain
That the purchaser of an automo
bile will never have another chance to
get so much fur his money cr to buy
so cheaply, is tb opinion of Mr. Mc
Kinnon, who distributes the Dort car,
says the Times-Union. As proof of
this sweeping statement, Mr. McKin
non calls attention to the sturdy, ef
ficient car turned out today as com
pared with their far less efficient pro
totypes of a few years ago. He alo
expresses the opinion that his pres
ent condition cannot continue for
more than a short time, and he quotes
some figures, which make one wonder
why more manufacturers have not al
ready raised their prices.
"The cost of motors," says Mr. Mc
Kinnon, "has gone up 15 per cent this
spring; steel has gone up 70 per cent;
tool steep has increased 200 per cent.
The cost of radiators has gone up 40
per cent on account of the increase in
price of brass and copper; bearing
metal has increased . 20 per cent.
White lead has increased 150 per
cent, and colors, from 10 per cent to
LOO per cent, and some cannot be ob
tained at any price. Leather has gone
up 25 per cent, mohair for tops, 25
per cent. All these materials enter
into the building of 'an automobile.
The manufacturers must have them
or go out of business. He is paying
these high prices to get them and this
extra cost of manufacture must soon
enter into the retail price to the con
sumer. . "Presumably you have the purchase
of an automobile in mind; to say that
it is a gotfd tip to place your order
now, is putting it mildly. You simply
cannot afford to delay at all if you ex
pect to own your car at anywhere near
present market prices'."

PRESSING EORIRD TO
111 FIG CLUBS
Boys from All Over Marion County
Taking Advantage of the Public
Spirit of the Banks
There has been a rush of boys from
all parts of the county to join the
boy's pig club, for which the banks
recently appropriated $1,075. R. W.
Blacklock, the county demonstration
agent, who will have charge of the
work of the club, has enlisted 38 boys
and expects to have more.
Some of the boys have agreed to
purchase their own pig. Mr. Black
lock says that any boy whose parents
will provide him with a pig can be
come a member of the club. The num
ber of boys who can be provided with
pigs out of the banker's fund is, of
course, limited. The breed of hog
that will be used has not yet been de
cided on. The farmers of the county
who have been seen by Mr. Blacklock'
express themselves as willing to ac
cept any standard breed selected,
with a view to standardizing the hogs
of the county and making this section
famous for one breed.
A meeting of the pib club boys will
be held in the board of trade rooms
here July 5, when the work will be
outlined and talks made to the boys.
There will probably be present one
or two experts from the government
experiment station in Gainesville.
The following boys have joined the
club:
Otto Beard, James Hough, Law
rence Moody, Summerfield; Thurlow
Bishop, Rodney Carn, Reddick; Blake
