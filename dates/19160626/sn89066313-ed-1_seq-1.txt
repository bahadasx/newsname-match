E. Sidney Stephens, It. B. Price, Jr.,
F. 11. Rollins and j. F. Barham- re
turned from Nevada, Mo., this morn
ing. They found sanitary conditions
at the camp excellent. Not a match
or piece of paper could be found on
the grounds.
The camp is arranged around a
main aveune about three-quarters of a
mile long. The tents, arranged in lines,
arc circular and accommodate seven J
privates and a corporal. Each cap
tain's tent is placed directly across
from the line of his company's tents.
Behind the captains' tents are the
tents of the majors and behind them
is the commanding officer's tent.
Water is provided from a deep well
which is piped along the avenue in
front of the tents. The meals arc
well cooked and the tents and bedding
clean.
The Columbia Company has picked
up military discipline and courtesy
very quickly, says Mr. Stephens. "Su
perior officers are recognized prop
erly, and every order is executed on
the run. The Machine Gun Company
is recognized as the first and best
company both in pcrsonell and in
drilling.
"The men expect to leave for the
front immediately. They do not know
where they will go, but expect that it
will be Fort Sam Houston, San An
tonio, Tex.. General Funston's head
quarters.
Uniforms were issued yesterday and
the guns will be given out today to
each member of the company.
All former students from Missouri
and other universities will be trans
fcrcd from their original company to
the company from Columbia. The
whole company will then be trans
ferred to the regular infantry and will
go with the First Regiment. If they
remained a machine gun company,
they would be held in Nevada for a
month.
Iieeause machine gun equipment
was not available at the present time,
the company has been changed to an
infantry company and is called of
ficially Company F, Fourth Infantry,
National Guard of Missouri.
The Harley Messenger Service has
arranged to ship eight Harley-David-son
motorcycles to Nevada, which will
be used to carry dispatches for the
regimental headquarters.
Eight Columbia men will be the
dispatch bearers and will ride the
motorcycles. They are Ray Horner,
Russel Womack, Walter Wade, Parks
Crawford, Earl Morgan, Dave Cald

Attorneys for the Wabash Railroad
I this afternoon filed a motion in the
Boone County Circuit Court for a new
trial of the case of Columbus Water
field against the Wabash Company.
Waterfield was awarded $5,000 dam
ages in his suit by a jury last week
for injuries received from being hit
by a Wabash engine at Centralia.
Today was divorce day in the Cir
cuit Court. The docket was the light

The cases of Edward against May
Harris, Kathryn1 L. against AI L.
James, Anna against Earl Turner,
Elesie Williams by next friend against
John Williams, and Arthur against
Willa Warren were tried and taken
under advisement by Judge David H.
Harris. He will give his decisions the
last day of the term.
The cases of Agnes against Welton
Ware, Albert against Elnorc Thomp
son. Harrison against Ida Wingo and
Noah M. against Marie Boyd were
continued.
The case of Carrie against Robert
Thomas Algeo was reset for Wednes
day, July 12, at the plaintiff's cost.
The Watson-O'Neal road case, ap

to all parties who were either peti
tioners or remonstrators was sus

WASHINGTON, June 2fi. Double
responsibility for the Carrizal inci
dent appears to be established today.
However, President Wilson probably
will appear before Congress before
the end of the week. Only a complete
"right-about-face" by Carranza will
save the situation.
The report of Captain Morey, as he
lay dying in the Carrizal desert, is
taken by officials to mean that action
by the American forces before Carrizal
might have been provocative of an at
tack. Unless Carranza agrees to release
the seventeen Americans held prisoners
at Chihuahua City and disavows Tre
vino's action of firing on Americans
and agrees for the future safety of
American troopers in Mexico, Wilson
will ask war. This is the opinion of
high officials this afternoon. They
admitted that Carranza is hardly in a
position to comply with the demands.
Ily United Press.
EL PASO, June 26. The border this
afternoon is awaiting the last diplo
matic moves before war is formally
begun. Everyone is convinced that
war is inevitahle.
Immediate interest centers in the
withdrawal of expeditions advanced
to the base of Namiquipa and Elvalle
and Carranza's reply to the American
ultimatum.
The general opinion is that Carranza
will not accede to President Wilson's
demands without being deposed from
the de facto throne by the army chiefs.
Obregon and Trevino have the whole
army behind them.
Ily United Press.
SAN ANTONIO, June 2C Captain
Lewis Morey, commanding Troop K or
the Tenth Cavalry, who sent General
Pershing the first official account of
the Carrizal incident, was found to
day, together with four negro troop
ers, at the San Luis ranch, according
to messages received by (Jeneral
Funston from General Pershing.
No mention is made of the condition
of Captain Morey.
.Major Jenkins, who found Morey. re
ported that he had sent out detach
ments of his company to scour the
country around San Domingo, but that
no stragglers had been encountered.
'o Candidate for Connly SurTejor.
The time limit for the filing of dec
larations by candidates for county of
fices ended last week. No one filed a
declaration as a candidate for county
surveyor. The present surveyor, Hugh
Brown, according to law, may hold the
position until his successor is elected
or appointed but Mr. Brown says ho
will refuse the office. The county
court has authority to appoint a man
to fill the place, and it will probably
take action before Mr. Brown's term
expires.
