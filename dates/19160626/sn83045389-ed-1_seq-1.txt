in on tli" wireless messages being I

They caught one message, evidently a j
warning to vessels, that the signal
lights on the Mexican coast were being

hut tnev were !r code. The Arling

As if they realized the serious po

went to their cots with a smile. War
to them seemed not so harsh a thing

of Salvador, to-day that Carrauza was
reaily to accept "In principle" otters ot
mediation to avert war between Mex

A similar reply was transmitted
i directly by Carran/.a to the govern
j ments of Chile, Argentina. Ecuador
, and Honduras, tn response to offers to
j act as mediators made by thos* gov
, ernments.
Mr. Arredondo said, however, that so
far he had revolved only a preliminary
J expressiott on the subject from Mex
ico City, and expected definite Instruc
tions some time to-night.
Minister Calderon has an appoint
ment with Secretary Lansing to-mor
row afternoon to learn whether offers
made by Bolivia and othet Latin
Amerlcan governments to mediate will
b?- entertained by the United States.
In anticipation of a possible accept
ance of such offers, Ambassador Ilo
nuilo S N'aon. of Argentina, and Dr.
CSonxaln S. Cordova, Eeuadorean min
i i s t <? r, are on their way to "\\ ashington
to attend any conference that Latin
Aroerican diplomats may hold In the
interest* of mediation.
If Secretary Lansing indicates that
an olfer of mediation will not be enter
tained, no further efforts to that end
will be made at this time. Brazil is
taking no part In the negotiations, fo?
one reason because that country's de
lay In recognizing Carranza might not
make her an acceptable mediator.
Kfforts to bring about arbitration, it
developed to-day began two weeks ago
with a suggestion transmitted by Min

ernment that such an attempt be made.
Ills government replied by giving him
full power to act, l>ut further steps
were not taken until he rc.timed to
Washington from a visit to New
Kochelle last Friday, when he imme

Minister Calderon said to-day:
"Americans hold to the idea that be

is not the case

WASHINGTON", .Tune 25.?A demand
for the immediate release of the
American troopers taken prisoner at
Carrizal, con pled with a stern notifi
cation that the United States expects
an early statement, of the purposes of
the Carrnnza government were tele
graphed to Mexico City by Secretary
Lansing.
The note discloses that the State De
partment yesterday received a commu
nication from the de facto government
stating that the Carrizal tight was the
[ direct result of orders to attack Amsr
| ican soldiers moving: otherwise than
toward the border, personally issued
j by General Carranza to General Tre
vlno and by the latter communicated to
I General Pershing.
J In reply, Secretary Lansing requires

of action it has determined upon"
through the usual diplomatic chan
i !iels. "anil not through subordinate mil
' itary officers."
The Mexican communication is con
strued, Secretary La using states, "as

HIMSELF 0\ RECOU!)
General Carrnnza is required to place
, himself on record formally, and the
| plain intimation lies behind the re
j strained language of Mr. Lansing's
j communication that force will be met
i with force. Apparently, however, the
J Washington government is determined
j that the do facto government shall not
evade responsibility before the world,
if war in forced upon the United
j States.
! The not* and the military situation
j of the United States were talked over
! at the White House to-night by the
! President with Chairman Stone, of the
j Senate Foreign Relations Committee;
j Senator Lodge, ranking Republican
; member, and Chairman Flood, of the
House Commute? on Foreign Affairs.
Representative Cooper, ranking mi
nority member of the House committee,
was out of town.
After the conference, which lasted
; more than an hour. Senator Stone said
I the situation "was exceedingly acute."
! hTe President had felt it necessary
| to acquaint Congress with the state
j of affairs, and with the action taken,
through the Foreign Affairs Committee.
It was indicated that he might desire
to address a joint session of the House
; and Senate in a day or two. but would
not take this tlnal step until the Mex
ican government had been given an op
! port unity to reply.
STONK EMPHATIC
IN 1)10WANT) r()H RELEASE
The President told those at the- con
, fcrente to-night of the note from Gen
eral Carranza avowing the attack on
the American troops at Carrizal, and
the reply that he had directed be sent.
Senator Stone was very emphatic after
wards in regard to the demand for re
liaso of the prisoners.
"We must have those men," he said
i solemnly. The Senator made no effort
to hide his own belief that war vir
tuallj is here A tlnal report from
| General Pershing was necessary, he
s;tid, in order that a clear knowledge
of \i hat had happened at Carrizal
should he at hand.
"Hut if they are going to attack our
men without cause," he said, "there is
only one thing to do. We will never
have peace down there until wo use
force enough to compel it."
There is reason to believe that the
military situation may be influencing
the administration's diplomatic course,
as well as the desire to make It clear
to the world and particularly to the
l.atin-Ainerh-nn nations that the United
States is i.eltm forced into warlike
measures lt\ the hostility of General
Ca r r.tnzn.
