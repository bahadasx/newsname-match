almost within the Carranzlsta llnei
at Carrizal. The Americans left In
email groups to aid tbelr chances of
-escaping safely. Morey and four
trooper remained until night, when
they started out to reach the Ameri
can lines. More? lost o much blood
that be was forced to give up and
ordered his men to tear, htm. Later
Morey rallied and made bla way to
YcCabe's house.
According to the latest official es
timates, the Americans lout twenty

Ban Antonio, June 26. Captain
Morey, commander of troop K, 10th
cavalry, who aent to General Persh
ing the first official account of the
battle at Carrlsal, waa found today
with four negro troopers at 8an Luis
ranch, according to a message from
Fershing to General Funston.
8an Antonio, June 28. A little,
rey, be-spectacled nan, whose stu
dious bearing appears almost incon
gruous In his army khaki, waa the
center of Interest 1n the Mexican
situation early today.
That man was Captain Lewis 8.
Morey, commanding troop K, 10th
cavalry, who, while desperately
wounded and apparently dying, sent
General Pershing the first officer's re
port of the battle at Carrlsal, In which
many of his troopers were slain by
Carranza aoldlers.
Morey wrote the letter to Pershing
while biding In an arroyo 2,000 yards
from the scene of the battle. When
u ! cnmnlMPd. he dlsnatched It
by three negro troopera who bad
taken refuge with him. These men
wsre picked up by troop M of the
10th, commanded by Lieut. H.. A.
Meyer, Jr.
The letter was addressed to Morey's
Immediate superior, the commanding
officer at OJo Federlco. It Is be
lieved Lieutenant Meyer aent It to
OJo Federlco, when It was forwarded
to Pershing. This would explain the
fact that the letter apparently was
not delivered to Pershing by Meyer
when the latter returned to tho camp
by the stragglers he found nt San
Luis ranch.
A wireless addressed to Morey's
wife In Austin, Texas, received last
night, read:
"Am bark on line and all well."
It was signed "Sydney," and sent
from "somewhere In Mexico." Gen
eral Funston had received no word
. early today af Morey's rescue. It la
not known whother Morey really had
' been picked up by some of Pershing's
men or whether the wireless had 1een
written at the same time as the let
ter to allay Mrs. Morey's fears,
Meyer reported that the. three un
bounded men with Morey carried
him several miles, but that he became
so weak from the loss of blood be
could go no ifarther and ordered then!
to leave hlnv He was shot through
the shoulder., The .men thought lie
was dying and left him. '

TO PREVENT WAR
Dueno Ayres, June 26. A list of
suggestions, designed to prevent war
between the United States and Mex
ico, were nubllshed today by La
Naclon, leading newspaper of South
America. Included In the Hat was a
proposal made by Romulo S. Naon,
Argentine ambassador to Washington,
for the establishment of a police tone
on both sides of the border to prevent
a repetition of bandit raids. LaNaclon
auggested that If these proposals met
with favorable reception In the
United States they be made the basla
of mediation by South American re
publics with a view to preventing hos
tilities. .
The chief proposal In the list waa
that relating to the establishment of
a police tone. Wherever Villlataa or
other bandits are oporatlng. La
Naclon suggests American troops
should be admitted to hunt them
down, though barred from the towns.

STRIKE II VIEW
San Francisco, June 26. Striking
longshoremen and waterfront' em
ployers will meet here today with
Henry M. White, tederal arbitrator,
In another effort to. settle the labor
trouble which crippled commerce
along the coast and caused two deaths
ln shooting affrays.
It was reported that the employers
wore ready to offer the strikers a
compromise. The longshoremen de
manded G5 cents an hour straight and
1 nn hour overtime. Employers are
said to offer 55 cents an hour and
82H cents for overtime. This. It Is
understood, will not be satisfactory
to the stevedores. .
The Toyo KIsen Kalsha Steamship
company may withdraw from the
waterfront employers' union, so It
can escape being affected by a strike
directed against that organization.
Authority from Toklo for the with
drawal Is being awaited. The T. K. K.
liners are under a Japanese govern
ment subsidy and must run on sche
duled time. An independent settle
ment with the strikers may be made
by this Japanese line. This would
be considered a Smashing victory for

noon, Victor Murdock of Kansas waa
placed In nomination for the presi

Balnbrldge Colby of New York.
Colby's action followed the com

Colby who nominated Roosevelt at
the progressive convention.
Murdock's nomination was second

ACTION OF AfJERICAII TROOPS AT

mm
Washington, June 26. A double
responsibility for the Carrizal battle
appeared partly established today. It
did not, however, place Bitch a bur
den on the United States forces as
to assure peace.
On the contrary, developments so
shaped themselves that It seems like
ly President Wilson may find It ne
cessary to appear before congress be
fore the week ends. Only a complete
right-about-face by Carranza can save
the situation.
The report of Captain Morey, as he
lay supposedly dying on the Carrizal
desert, Indicated to the officials that
the action of the United Statea forces
before Carrizal might have been pro
vocative. Morey wrote that Captain Boyd
was under the impression tnat tue
Mexicans would run when the Amer
icana fired. "Weiformed for attack,"
said Morey's report.
On the other baud the publication
of the United States' demands tor tbe
release of 17. American prisoners
from Chihuahua City showed that
Carranza had Issued the order to Gen
eral Trevlno not to permit tbe Amer
icans to move south, east or west.
This would place upon Carranza
the responsibility for the Mexicans
firing and perhapB prove tbe neces
sity for Boyd's offensive.
Persons In touch with President
Wilson's views said he would delay
going before congress on a war mes
sage until Carranza had answered.the
United States ultimatum. , ..
Declining Nomination for
"Hare yon Murdock'i consent to
run?" he asked.
"No, but 1 haven't hi refusal,
either," said Colby. , J
Robins then' shouted at Colby:
"Isn't It true that you have pledged
support to Woodrow Wilson?"
Colby said he had not, and that any
body who said be bad was a liar.
"I think you have," Robins said.
The committee waa In a turmoil.
James R. Garfield, of Ohio, got the
floor and sought to convince the com
mittee against nomination of Mur
dock. " ; ,
Murdock Is either In California or
en route to China, Garfield said.
Chicago, Jnne 26. Theodore
Roosevelt today definitely refused the
nomination of the progress! vea for
president, and In a letter to the bull
moose national committee urged tbelr
support of-Charles E. Hughes. :
so era, based largely on the necessity
for patriotic Americanism.
The committee waa sharply di
vided when it met. (One faction, led
by Captain John M. Parker, the pro
gressive vice-presidential nominee,
advocated continuance of the party
organisation, regardless of the col
onel's stand. Another, led by
George W, Perkins, sought to win
the committee to Roosevelt's view.
Still another faction demanded the
Issue be put up to the progressive
state organizations for individual
action. .
A tight In the committee was ex
pected to begin after the colonel's let
ter was finished.
The bulk of the 100,000 militia
men ordered out will probably be
either on the line or en route before
the end of the week. Everything
possible 1b being done to hasten the
departure of the entire force. ;
These preparations, coupled with
war department activity, reflected the
view of army men that trouble Is lu
the offing, though they admitted di
plomacy may still have a chance.
The campaign contemplates tak
ing sufficient time to avoid unneces
sary casualties through lack of pre
paration. It proposes sweeping into
Mexico from strategic border points,
locking In the northern Mexican
forces, seizing Torreon and Saltlllo
to control railroads, and pushing
through to Mexico City. ,
As matters now stand, this wilt re
quire stripping the border patrol (of
regulars. At some points this must
be delayed, pending the arrival of
militia.
In order that there may be plenty
of men, a call for volunteers will
probably be one of the president's
first moves.
