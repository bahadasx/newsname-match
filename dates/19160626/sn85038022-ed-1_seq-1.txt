MEXICAN COMMUNICATION IS CON
NTKUKU AS AVOWAL OK HE.
I,IIIEKATKI.V HOSTILE
ACTION
Washington, Juno 25 A demand for
the ImmcJiato rolcnso of tho Amcrl
can troopers taken prisoner nt Carrl-
zal, coupled with a stern notllicntlon
that the United States expects an early
statement of tho purposes of the Car
ranza government was telegraphed to
Mexico City today by Sccrctnry urns
Inc.
The note discloses Hint the State
Department received yesterday a com
munication from the dc facto govern
ment stating that the Cnrrlzal fight
was tho direct result of orders to at
tack American soldiers moving other
wise than toward tho border, person
ally issued by General Carranza to
Trevlno and by tho latter coinmuni
cated to General Pershing.
In reply Secretary Lansing requires
that the do facto government trans
mit a dcflnlto statement " as to the
course of action it had determined up
on" through tho usiitl diplomatic
channels, and "not through subordi
nate military olllcers.
The Mexican communication is con
strurd, Secretary Lansing states, as
a formal avowal of deliberately hostile
action agnlust tho forces of tho united
States now In Mexico, and of the pur
pose to "attack without provocation
whenever they moved from their pres
ent position," dcsplto the friendly mis
slon on which they nro engaged and
which Is affirmed in the American re
joinder.
I'orro Met lVIth Force
General Carranza Is required to
place himself on record formally and
the plain Intimation Is behind the rc
strained language of Mr. I-inshiR's
communication that force will be met
with force.
Apparently however, tho Washing
ton government Is determined that the
do facto government shall not evade
responsibility before tho world If war
Is forced upon tho United States.
Tho note and tho military situation
of the United States wore talked over
at tho White House tonight by the
President with Chnirmau Stone of tho
Senate Foreign Relations committee,
Senator Lodge, ranking Republican
members and Chairman Flood of the
House Committee on foreign affairs,
Representative Cooper, ranking
minority member of tho House Com
mltteo, was out of the city.
Situation "ExcrcilliiBlr Arulo
After tho conference which lasted
more than an hour. Senator Stone said
tho situation was "exceedingly acute."
President Wilson had folt it necessary
to acquaint Congress with tho state of
affairs and tho action taken through
the foreign affairs committee. It was
Indicated that ho might desiro to ad
dress a joint session of the House and
Senate in a day or two but would not
ako this final step until tho Mexican
government had been given an op
portunlty to reply.
The President told those of tho con
ference tonight of tho note from Gen
eral Carranza avowing tho attack on
American troops nt Carrlzal and of tho
reply that ho directed to bo scut. Sen-
ntor Stone was very emphatic after
ward In regard to the demand for the
rolense of tho prisoners.
"Wo must have those men," ho said
solemnly.
Tho senator made no effort to hide
his own belief that war virtually Is
here. A final report from General
Pershing was necessary, he said, In
order that clear knowledge of what
had happened at Carrlzal should bo at
hand.

Maysvlllo is tho most desirable route,
