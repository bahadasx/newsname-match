WASHINGTON, June 26. —A double responsibility
for the Carrizal battle appeared partly established today.
As he lav supposedly dying on the Carrizal battle
field, Capt. Morey, in a message received bv Gen. Per
shing yesterday, wrote that Capt. Boyd, commanding
the detachment, was under the impression that the Mexi
cans would run when the Americans fired.
"\Ve formed for attack," wrote Morey, in describing
the action.
On the other hand, publication of the American de
mand for the release of 17 prisoners from Chihuahua
showed that Carranza had issued the order to Gen. Tre
vino not to permit the Americans to move south, east
or west.
This would place upon Carranza the responsibility
for the Mexicans' firing and perhaps prove the necessity
for Boyd's offensive.
Persons in touch with President Wilson's views say
he will delay going before congress with a war message
until Carranza has had time to answer this government's
ultimatum.
Carranza must immediately release American
troopers taken prisoners in the battle at Carrizal, and
must give the United States government a statement de
claring the purposes of Mexico.
This is the ultimatum telegraphed to Mexico City
by Secretary of State Lansing.
The ultimatum went forward late yesterday, fol
lowing a day of conferences in Washington. This gov
ernment desires, before breaking relations or going to
war with Mexico, to have Carranza's intentions formal
ly on record.
The note disclosed for the first time that Secretary
l.ansing had received, the day previous, a communica
tion from the Carranza government, assuming all re
fponsibility for the attack on U. S. troopers at Carrizal.

CONGRESS LEADERS
DECLARE WAR WITH
MEXICO IS CERTAIN
\A7ASHINGTON, June 26.—Indications today are that war be
' ' tween the United State* and Mexico is a matter of hours. A
call for 250,000 volunteers will b; issued following the declaration,
it is expected.
Chairman Flood of the house foreign affairs committee told the
house today that war seemed a certainty.
Congress awaits word from President Wilson.
He gave notice to congressional leaders today that he would
probably address the house and senate in joint assembly upon re
ceipt of Carfanza's reply to the latest American note.
Senate and house leaders have pledged the president their support.
The senate is preparing today to rush passage of the resolution drafting
militiamen into national service, with the provisiou that any militiaman with de
pendents may claim exemption from the regulation.
Army officers consider that 500,000 men will be needed to carry on an ag
gressive war thfu Mexico.
275,000 MEN NOW AVAILABLE FOR WAR
The militia troops already called to the border will constitute a force of 200,000
men. The regulars in Mexico and on the border number approximately 75,000.
The 200,000 militiamen will first be strung along the border to cover territory
now patrolled by 15,000 regulars.
There no\\[ is an average of but one regular soldier for every mile of border
territory.
The regulars, in the event of war, will probably be sent immediately into
Mexico to augment the punitive forces. It is believed the men under Gen. Per
shing will be adequate to stand against any Mexican campaign, but would not
be able to sweep thru the enemy's land without the aid of volunteers and militia
men.
Army men, therefore, estimate that from four to six months would elapse be
fore a general campaign thru Mexico could be undertaken.
During that time the volunteers would be formed and equipped and militia
men trained.
U. S. HAS EQUIPMENT FOR HALF MILLION MEN
Kach town and hamlet in conquered Mexican territory would have to be oc
cupied indefinitely by adequate troops.
The government has equipment for 500,000 volunteers.
Seven-inch field artillery equipment, said to correspond to the famous
"French 755," lias been turned out in great numbers and put in storage during
the last year.
The volunteer forces would be organized and officered by regular army men.
