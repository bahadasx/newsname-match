communicated to General Pershing.
In reply, Secretary Lansing requires
that the defacto government has to
Inform his as to the course of action
It has determined uonw "through the
usual diplomatic channels," and not
through subordinate military offi
cers." The Mexican communication is con
strued. Secretary Lansing Bays, as
formal avowal of deliberately hostile
action against the forces of the Unit
ed States now in Mexico, and of the
purpose to attack without' provocation
when ever they move from their pres
ent position, despite the friendly mis
sion on which they are engaged and
which Is reaffirmed in the -American
rejoinder. . , .- .-
Force Will Be Met .With Force.
General Carranza Is required - to
place himself on record formally and
the plain intimation lies oemna me
restrained language of Mr. Lansing's
communication that force will be met
with foreo. Apparently, however, the
"Washing! r. government ts determined
that tho 6e facto government shall
not evade responsibility before the
world, if war is forced upon the Unit
el States.
Tolket Over at White House.
The note and the military situation
of the Uniiea States were talked over
at tho White House tonight by the
president with Chairman Stone of the
senate foreign lelations committee.
Senator Lodge, ranking representa
tive member and Chairman Flood of
the house committee on foreign af
fairs. Representative Cooper, rank
ing minority member of the " house
committee, was out of the city.
Conference Lasted an Hour.
After the conference, which lasted
more than an hour. Senator Stone said
the situation was "exceedingly acute."
President Wilson had felt it necessary
to acquaint congress with the state
of atfairs and the action, through the
roreign affaire committees. It was
Indicated that he might desire to ad
dress a Joint session of the house and
senate In a day or two, but would not
tke this final step until the Mexican
government has been given an oppor
tunity to reply.
Demands Release of Prisoners,
The president told those at the con
ference tonight of the note from Gen
eral Carranza avowing the attack on
American troops at Carrlzal and of the
reply that he had directed to be sent.
- Senator Stone was very emphatic aft
erwards In regard to the demand for
the release of the prisoners.
"We must have those men,'1 he said
solemnly.

There is reason to believe that the
military Mutation is influencing the
acmlnlstratior.'s diplomatic course as
well as to make It clear to the world
and to the Latin American nations
that the United States is being forced
Into war-like measures by the nostill
ty of General Carranza.
Speeding Up Mobilization..'
The war department Is makingevery
ftort to speed up mobilization of the
rational guard. A few companies
have been mustered in. Others will
take the oath tomorrow. In 48
hours, probably a substantial force
will be en route to the border to back
p General Funston's 'line. It ' may
be four or five days, howecer, before
the war department officials would
feel safe In withdrawing regulars from
the border patrol to form the cutting
edge of whatever force they may hurl

Per.felng's column should aggressive
action be ordered.
It seems doubtful that a formal dip

President Wilson's desire should Gen
eral Carranza force the use of , the
rmy aeainst him. Mr. Wilson's vis
itors thought tonight on the ques
tions. Specific figures were not avail
able as to the garrisons at various
border towns; the number of guards
men who have responded to the presi
dent's call or the time that would be
-flulred Jo get the entire force to the
border. These details have been left
to the war department and Secretary
Baker was not present at the con
ference. The general situation was
presented, however, and there is rea
son to suppose that the foreign af
fairs committeemen approved ' the
president's course.
Mediation Not Discussed.
One fact as to the conference 1b
slgnificent. There was no discussion
of the possibility of mediation. The
subject was not mentioned either by
the president or his callers. Senator
Stono said.
"This statement came in the face of
a formal . notification to Elizo Arre
dondo. Mexican ambassador deslgnat
by his government today, that it
approved the principle of mediation
as proposed by several Latln-Amerl
can countries. 'Mr. Arredondo expect'
ed early authorization to begin con
versations with his Latin-American
colleagues here,, in an effort to divert
the crisis to peaceful channels.
Nothing to Mediate.
There were no indication -tonight
that any diplomat .had attempted to
sound Secretary Lansing in this re
gard. It is known however, that he
holds that the United States has noth
ing to mediate, since Its 'only object
is the .protection, of,, its.. own oorflers.
tie has formally notified all Latin
American diplomats'- that- the 'Wash
lngton government has no aggresive
purpose toward Mexico but it ie re
solved to free Its -citizens along the
border of the danger of bandits' raids.

MEICANS ARE NOT
ALLOWED TO LEAVE COUNTRY
Men and Women Detained on Ground
of "Military Necessity."
New York, June 25. Military au
thorities of Mexico have prohibited
the departure from that country of
any of her subjects either men or
women on the grounds of "military
necessity- according to passengers
ana omcers on the Ward Line steam
ship Esperanza, which arrived here to
day from Tamplco, Vera Cruz and
frogreso.
The passengers said the decree pro.
hibiting emigration was issued from
the-office of the de facto nrenident of
the republic just prior to the sailing
or tne msperanza Irom Tamplco, and
it had the effect of stoDDine bet-ween
thirty and forty Mexicans who had
planned to take the ship for the Unit
ed States. At Vera Cruz and at Pro
greso the situation was the same.
At Progreso, the last Mexican port
of call for the ship, a Mexican' who
had gone aboard at Tampico before
the . decree was promulgated, left the
ship to go ashore to attend to some
business. He did not come back and
it was pronounced hat he had been
prevented from embarKlnsr.
The Esperanza brought more than
100 passengers from the (Mexican norta
the majority of whom were employes
or me American owned mining and
oil companies. They united i n stav
ing that the situation in all the ports
was serious when they left and that
the safety of Americans depended up
on the uncertain power the military
authorities held over the people, sup
ported by the fear of United States
war vessels which means generally
believed to be waiting withan an easy
call. ' , .

mal avowal of deliberately hostile ac
tion against the forces or the United
States now in Mexico and of the pur
pose to attack them without provoca
tion whenever they move from their
present position in pursuance of the
objects for which they were sent
there, notwithstanding the fact that
these objects not only involve no un
friendly intention towards the govern

States against irresponsible and in
surgent bands of rebel marauders.

government to demand the immediate

FOUR UNDERGROUND
LABORERS KILLED IN BOSTON
Explosion of Compressed Air Released
Bricks Which Fell on Them.
Boston. June 25. Four underground
laborers were killed yesterday at the
bottom of an 85-foot shaft by an ex
plosion of compressed air which re
leased bricks, water and - sand upon
their heads.. Another workman, oper
ating a hoist at the top of the shaft,
was blown through the air and . caught
on the derrick hook. He was taken
to a hospital severely Injured.
The dead: Albert Eastern of thin
city, a miner; John Corbett of Fall
River, a miner; Harry Owens, of Cam
bridge, a sand digger: all negroes, and
an unidentified white man, also em
ployed in digging sand. -
The shaft in which the exbloslon oc
curred had been sunk on the city aide
of the reserve channel between South
Boston and the city oroDer. and the
workmen were engaged In extending
it under the channel itself. It was to
be used as a conduit for wires by the
Edison Electric Illuminating company,
and was being constructed by the
Hugh Nawn Contracting company.
The men killed were alone in the
shaft at the time, although the fore
man and two others had mounted to
the surface only a moment before to
receive their pay. The explosion burst
through a compartment about 20 feet
from the top and lifted the lock which
formed the shaft entrance several
feet. It broke through the 16-lnch
masonry wall erected about the bore,
and the waters of the channel rushed
through with sand to drown the men
already pinned and injured by the de
bris. A diver was obtained later and
workmen were set to clearine the
shaft opening to allow him to react
the bottom to recover the bodies.
