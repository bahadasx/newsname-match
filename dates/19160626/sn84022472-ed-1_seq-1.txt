That tle sore throat, glandular and

TWO FAINT IN
RUSH TO GET
CERTIFICATES
Nearly 4,000 Children Have
Obtained Cards Entitling
Them to Work.
Two children have . collapsed and
many have been nearly crushed in the
crowds that have stormed the state
board of education rooms in the Ma
sonic temple,, seeking certificates to
prove they are of working age. '
Never in the history of Bridgeport,
according to Charles N. Hall, com
missioner in charge, have more than
1,000 children sought certificates , dur
ing any one year. Today, the seventh
day of granting certificates, nearly
4,000 children had obtained the slip
of paper that entitled them to get
Jobs. This number may be doubled
before the end of the summer. About
450 a day seek the certificates.
At the Masonic temple today, a ser
pentine line of children starting from
Commissioner Hall's desk, wound in
and out along the south wall to the
stairs and down the stairs to the
street. -. ;
There were as many girls as boys
or more in the crowd. Truant Offi

"There are only 160 in that line "
said Officer Farnan, "and they are in
single file. Last Wednesday we had as
Ifuig a line but the children were two
abreast.
"It's surprising and nothing more
forcibly indicates the prosperity of
Bridgeport. They're getting jobs."
"You'd be' surprised to see the
number of places where they' get jobs.
Factories, stores, candy kitchens, fruit
stands and almost every kind of busi-
ness is employing them."
Commissioner Hall works every day
from. 8:30 o'clock until midnight on
the certificates. Today he had four
clerks helping him and ; early last
week 10 were necessary. Last year,
he accomplished the work alone.
With Commissioner Hall alone in
the. office Monday; the first day of is
suance, the 'storm of children broke.
They filled the corridor until there
was scarcely standing room. The
little office where Commissioner Hall
sat was besieged and the ones who
got there early perched on the desks
and tables and- chairs, while others
occupied the standing room on the
floor.
Tuesday was another bad day. Two
children fainted in the pushing and
crowding. A request for police aid
was sent and Wednesday the truant
officers were placed on the job.
The office opens at 8:30 o'clock and
closes at 3. . From 3 o'clock until 12
the commissioner and his assistants
are busy making out reports to be
mailed the parents and the state board
headquarters.
ALL RECORDS FOR
DIVORCE BROKEN
IN LOCALCOURTS
Almost 300 Separations
Granted in Fairfield Coun
ty Superior Court.
The coming of prosperity to this
city left a trail of divorces in its
wake and the returns show that all
records for the granting of decrees
were broken during the" court term
which closed last week. In the su
perior court 289 couples were sep
arated, a mark that surpasses any
thing hitherto known in this county.
The biggest number in previous
years' was 203 in 1914 while in 1915
the number dropped to 175. The to
tal of 289 during the recent session
was made while the court Vaa held
in this city from last October until
June 23. There were so many cases
on the docket that special divorce
days were assigned during the April
thS w.hh .n ..t:,..
heard 141 cases in that period.
Although it has been a popular
belief that divorces were luxuries in
dulged in only by the rich the court
records prove this a fallacy. Of the
great number grunted in this city

REMINGTON CO.
Penfield to Be Succeeded by J
Former U. M. C. Co. Of
ficial Immediately.
REORGANIZATION OF
PLANTS TO FOLLOW
Many Changes Under New
Regime Expected By
Munitions Workers.
Major Walter G. Penfield, IT. S. A.,
retired, works manager of the Rem
ington Arms & Ammunition Co. and
the Union Metallic Cartridge Co. will
be succeeded by Harry H. Plnney, -who
was formerly connected with the Union
Metallic Cartridge Co.
A notice was posted in the plants
this morning that Major Fenfield's re
tirement takes effect at once naming
his successor. The change is one of
the numerous ones that are being
made, including the abolition of the
publicity department, the paid fire de
partment, ; part of the guard system
and . much of the . employment of un
skilled help.
-Mr. Pinney is generally credited
with having perfected the organization
of the U M. C. Co. along the lines
now in force, nine years ago. The
shot tower was built under his super
vision. He gained notoriety when he
engineered a great contract for big
shells with the Argentine government.
His work in this city attracted the
attention of Hugh Chalmers, presi
dent of the Chalmers Motor Co. and
he was employed by that concern at
large salary. His health breaking
down, he retired from the position and
engaged himself as consulting engineer
witkra- number cjf.fiFms. He is an
expert mechanical engineer, who
worked up from the ranks, in the
Brown & Sharpe Co. of Providence.
He will have charge of the Arms plant
and the U. M. C. Co.'s plant in Ho-
ken, N. J.
His engagement is expected to mean
complete reorganization of the Rem
ington plants.
Major Penfield came to this city
from Springfield, where he held an
executive position in the government
arsenal. Before .that he had experi
ence at .Fort Worth. He has been
head of Remington interests here
since the establishment of the Rem
ington Arms & Ammunition Co.'s new
plant. -

WILL RUSH NEW
EAST END PLANT
Birdsey-Somers ''University
of Corsets" Small Part in
Plans of Factories.
To meet the manufacturing require
ments. of its ever-increasing business
the management of the American
Graphophone Co. is preparing to
erect a huge addition to the Birdsey-
Somers Co., "University of Corsets,"
in Barnum avenue, which it recently
purchased. The addition to the plant
will be a three-story steel and con
crete building of the most modern
factory construction and it will be lo
cated to the east of the present hand
some building. A larger power plant
also will be built.
"Work will commence on the new
buildings as soon as the contracts can
be let. They are being advertised
now. It is expected that the building
will be ready for occupancy by fall
and that the Birdsey-Somers factory
will be equipped with machinery by
that time. The new branch of the
Graphophone Co. plant will furnish
employment for several thousand
persons. It is reported that the new
plant will be used exclusively for the
manufacture of Dictophone parts, but
this could not be verified today.
The Birdsey-Somers Co. still occu
pies a portion i of the Barnum avenue
factory, other parts being used by the
Graphophone Co. for storage pur
poses.
Secretary George W. Greer, of "the
Birdsey-Somers Co., said today that
his company is negotiating for a fac
tory building in Bridgeport and that
the business would not be removed
from this city. He said arrangements
for a new location probably would be
made this week and preparations to
move would begin at once.

ULTIMATUM OF U. S.
Question of War Depends on
His Reply, Expected at
Any Hour.
EH Paso, June 26 Information
reached here today from apparently
reliable sources that Francisco "Villa,
until recently at Santa Rosalind,
reached an agreement with the da
facto government and that this was
being used to induce his followers to
join the Carranza foroes.
CARRANZA GETS NOTE.
Washington, June 26 Secretary
Lansing's note to the de facto govern
ment reached Mexico City last night
and Special Agent Rodgers arranged
to deliver it immediately. This was
reported in a cablegram from Mr.
Rodgers sent last night and received
today.
Whether a state of war shall exist
between the United States and the de
facto government of Mexico depends
upon the formal declaration of policy
by General Carranza which is expect
ed hourly. The American government
will insist upon the" immediate release
of the cavalrymen captured, at Carri-
zal as demanded in the note but high
officials of the administration explain
in interpreting the communication
that the course of the United States
will be determined by Carranza's final
statement of his intention toward the
American expedition, in Mexico 'to pro
tect the border rather than on the spe
cific circumstances of the Carrizal in
cident. South American republics, through
their representatives here, inquired in
formally today of Elizeo Arredondo,
Carranza's ambassador designate.
whether his government would accept
offers of mediation in the crisis be
tween Mexico and the United States.
Threatened to Slash
Sister's Face If She
Spurned Her Husband
European customs in the United
States were brought to light today
by the arrest of James Chary of An
sonia on the complaint of his sister,
Mrs. James Drunkie, of 271 Sixth
street, who. alleges that Chary
threatened .to slash her face last week
because she would not go back to her
husband.
Chary was arrested by Detectives
James Dooley and John Flynn at the
instigation of Mrs. Drunkie. She
states that she was forced by her
family to marry Drunkie against her
wishes about a year ago, directly af
ter she came to this country from
Greece. She is 22 years of age and
he 44. They continually wrangled
and last week when she went to a
carnival he became angry and left
her.
Later her brother met Jier on the
street and threatened to slash her
face unless Mrs. Drunkie returned to
her husband. The complaint was
lodged with the police and Chary is
being held for investigation.

OF CARRANZISTAS
El Paso, June 26 General Persh

Mexico is ready for action if action is
necessary. Today, according to the
best information here, his southern
most outpost is near El Valle less
than 50 miles from Colonia Dublan,
the main base. It is believed that
from El Valle a large and mobile
force may be pointed eastward in a
strategic position toward the Mexican
Central railroad.
In the neighborhood of 12,000 men

CARRANZA MAKES
IMPORTANT SHIFT
IN DEFENSE LINE
San Antonio, June 26 News reach
ing army headquarters here today in
dicated that the Mexican forces along
the Rio Grande, from Matamoras to
Juarez, either have withdrawn their
main strength from the border or are
preparing to do it. It is also indi
cated that these troops are taking
steps at strategic points along a line
well south of the border where rail
road junctions allow of the rapid
handling of troops or where the topo
graphy of the country permits of a
strong defense.-
Their new line, it is reported, paral
lels the course of the Rio Grande, and
would command the strategic points of
Monterey and Saltillo, the Coahuila
coal mines, which furnish tbe main
fuel supply of Mexico; Paredon, the
main railroad junction point between
Monterey and Saltillo, and Torreon,
and probably will be the main base
of the Mexican army, and Chihuahua
City.
