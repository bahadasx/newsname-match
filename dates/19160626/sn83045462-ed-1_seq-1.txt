President Wilson Expected
to Tell Congress U. S. Must
Restore Order in Mexico
The expectation is that President Wilson
will appear before Congress?how soon <
nobody yet knows?make a statement of 1
the relations of this country with Mexico; <
indicate that the hostility of Mexico to <
this country is so pronounced as to lead ]
to attack upon soldiers of the United
8tates; declare that It is no longer possible
to avoid the duty of restoring order
in Mexico, and ask Congress to authorize
him to take such steps as may be
necessary to protect the troops now in
that country as well as the border and enforce
law and order.
This attitude would be subject to
modifications, depending upon the position
of Mexico and further clashes between
troops of the two countries, but
the administration does not now desire
a declaration of war if hostilities become
inevitable. The government of
the United States, in spite of aggravations
that are unparalleled, has no
i-uch feeling to Mexico as a country
hat would call for a formal declaration
of war.
Caaranza and his Mexican officials
? .opear to be trying to reach the same
%rt of position. They. too. ao not r

before the world as simply opposing c

f the United States in their own ter- J
itory. t
Carranza Trying to Hold Men.
'"arranza. according to all informa'ion
from there, is seeking to retrain
his troops to a defensive ay* ?
titude and to the enforcement of his 1
orders that soldiers of the -United 2
States must not move in directions 1
| other than toward the border. ^
The danger that the soldiers of both *
countries cannot be held exactly to $
their orders is appreciated in official c
circles here, and it is this that is giving 1
President Wilson serious worry. With r
the fighting men of two armies facing
one another, perfectly willing to engage j
in fighting, the job of being gentle and \
considerate is regarded as a most try- {
ing one. The President and Carranza j
may both mean well and earnestly wish f
to avoid war. but it is felt today among j
high officials of this government that j
the long-looked-for clash cannot be t
avoided. \

It is known that officials regard Car-anza's
action in this connection as

had no means of determining the decree

federals in northern Mexico. The fear

instances where the acts of military
commanders have been later die- .
ivowed by the de facto government, and
t is known that many of Carranza's j
commanders are not fully under his control.
1
Secretary Lansing's purpose in demanding
a formal diplomatic statement
is understood to be a desire to place responsibility
upon Gen. Carransa for ?
war, if it comes to that. Officials ex- i
pected within a few hours a reply
which would indicate clearly whether he :
s willing to accept that responsibility
or not.

EL PASO, Tex., June 26.?
Gen. Pershing's punitive expeditionary
force in Mexico is ready
for action if action is necessary.
Today, according to the best information
here, his southernmost
outpost is near El Yalle, less than
fifty miles from Colonia Dublan,
the main base. It is believed that
from El Valle a large and mobile
force may be pointed eastward In
a strategic position toward the
Mexican Central railroad. In the
neighborhood of 12,000 men, i:i
splendid fighting trim, compose
Gen. Pershing's army. Reports
from the front indicate the high- '
est morale among the men.

Here, might at any time embroil the

commanders to redouble their vigilances
today. At all points soldiers ,
were ready to spring into action at a 1
moment's notice. Troop dispositions .
were made with a view to meeting sud
!en and unexpected emergencies.
Five thousand National Guards are

Mexicans Withdraw From Border. <
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., June 26.?News
reaching army headquarters today
would seem to indicate that the Mexican
forces along the Rio Grande from
Matamoros to Juarez either have with- <
drawn their main strength from the
border or are preparing to do so. It 1
also is indicated that these troops are *
taking station at strategic points along
a line well south of the border where
railroad junctions allow of the rapid
handling of troops or where, the topography
of the country would permit of
a strong defense. Their new line, it is
reported, paraxials in a way the course
at the Rio Grande and would command
the main lines of advance toward
the strategic points of Monterey and
Saltillo, the Coahuila coal mines which
furnish the main fuel supply of Mexico
and on which the movement of locomotives
depends; Paredon, the main railroad
junction point between Monterey
and Saltillo. and Torreon. which probably
will be the main base of the Mexican
army, and Chihuahua City.

Praises Progressive Convention.
Before speaking of anything: else.
I wish to express my heartiest and
most unstinted admiration for the
character and services of the men
and women who made up the progressive
national convention in
1916. I can give them no higher
praise than to say that in all respects
they stood level with the men
and women who in 1912 joined at
Chicago to found the progressive
party. These two conventions, in
character, in disinterestedness, in
vision, in insight, in high purpose nd
in desire to render practical service
to the people, typified exactly what
such bodies ought to be in a great
sen-governing democracy. They
represented the spirit which moved
Abraham Lincoln and his political
associates during the decade pre- ,
ceding the close of the civil war. 1

15.000 will leave here today and the
balance as soon as they can be recruited
to war strength and obtain the necessary
equipment."
A report that medical examination of
the soldiers-' would be waived was denied
by Gen. Wood, who said that only
the taking of their finger prints would
be dispensed with. Surgeons of the

I Capt. Horace P. Hobbs, the regular

conference shortly before 1 o'clock with
Maj. Gen. Leonard Wood, commanding
the Department of the East, U. S. A.,
with headquarters at Governors Island.
J It was reported to Gen. Wood that there
I were only three companies of the 3d
Infantry up to their minimum strength
i of sixty-five men.
He reported that, following the physical
examination, there would not be any
company with the minimum number of
I men required. The mustering officer was
I informed by Gen. Wood that the 3d
Infantry should not be mustered until the
companies get the required number of
men. Although there is urgent demand
from the Department of the East to get
these troops into the field, they probably
will be delayed on account of the shortage
of men.
It was reported to Gen. Wood thatthe
Signal Corps Company has been
mustered and that the men are now
undergoing physical examinations.
It is now understood that boys in
the guard between eighteen and twenty-one
will be mustered.
Signal Corps Mustered In.
^ Following instructions from the headquarters
of the Department of the East.
U. S. A., to the mustering officer at
Cfamp Ordway to report all tactical
units as soon as they are ready to

Signal Corps company, which was mus- ,
) tered this morning. Capt. Terry im,
mediately reported that he was ready
to move his men on three hours' notice.
I Other tactical units will be sent out |
as fast as they are ready and the
' mustering of the troops will continue
. through the afternoon and probably j
' during the night.
I In order to complete the muster and 1
