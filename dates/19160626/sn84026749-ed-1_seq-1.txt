CHICAGO, June 26. Colonel

He declined the Progressive

GUARD ORDERED TO BORDER
PRESIDENT PLEASED BY
AID OF BUSINESS MEN
President Wilson today voiced appreciation of the response of
American business men in the present Mexican crisis.
In a letter to L. A. D. Percival, president of the Amalgamated
Paint Company, New York, who has just given notice to
his employes that any who enlist hi the army or national
guard will receive full pay fr.om the company during their
absence, the President wrote as follows:
My Dear Mr. Percival:
Your letter of June 21 with its enclosure has given mo the
greatest pleasure. The patriotic response of the business men
of America in tho present unusual circumstances of the country
has been what I, personally, confidently expected it would be,
and it affords me genuine pleasure to havo this opportunity to
express my admiration and gratification.
Cordially and sincerely yours,
WOODROW WILSON.
The action of the paint company is one of many. Senator
Hasting of Wisconsin called at the White House with a
telegram from the common council of Rippin, Wis. Re
cently $75,000 was appropriated for a postoffice at Rippin,
but learning of the needs of the Army Aviation Corps, the
council wired its representative in Congress' asking that
the appropriation be diverted for the construction of army
aeroplanes.

Chairman Chamberlain, of the Senate
Military Committee, this afternoon pre
sented to the Pen ate a resolution au
thorizing President Wilson to draft
militiamen, and use them In Mexico,
and urged its Immedlato adoption.
Senator Hitchcock of Nebraska, at

"It Is as much a married man's duty

"Wo should pay the guardsmen liber-

"If we don't core for tlieso men's
families, how can we hope to havo poor
men enlist for the guard hcrcaftar?
They are the first to be called, and yet
the pcopto and taxpayers safo at home
hesitate at caring even for thtlr
families.
"Exemption Ms not satisfactory. Many
a man who ought nol to wnu 1 remain
in nto service, ramei man race future

many trained guardsmen out of tho
service ana put in many unt mined.
It
would demoralize our forcei."
Volunteers Later.
"If we had to call 600,000 volunteers
would you also care to pay tho depend
ents of all them?" Interrupted Senator
Overman of North Carolina.
"That's a bridge I'd cross when I
camo to It," said Hitchcock.
"Tho whole system of drafting na
tional guardsmen Is wrong," said Sena
tor Works of California. "They contem
plated no such service when they en
listed. If there Is any draft, It ought
to bo general."
"This Is not tlmo for cavlllnir over
terms of aiding our soldiers," said Sen
ator Reed. "War may bo declared
within a few hour- Wo must pro

"Shall one man ono class of men

"The man who would grudgo a con

Gen. Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff,
made a hurried automobile trip to tho
District mobilization camp at noon to
day and talked with General Harvey
about arangements for tho Imme

Owing to the short notice the militia
had of the Secretary's coming, the bat
teries of artillery did not havo tlmo to

guns. This omission passed unnoticed.
The moving orders created the utmost
excitement and enthusiasm among the

"I have no definite plana of media

with my home government probably
will be necessary before proceeding tr

All Militia to Be Used
Before Volunteers
That, in tho event of war with
Mexico, no volunteers would bo
called for, until tho militia or
ganization was completed and
tho men all on the border, was
the opinion expressed by War
Department officials today.
They said it would be useless to
call for volunteers when all
available equipment is being
absorbed by tho militia, and
there were', under present con
ditions, no officers who could be
used to train these volunteers.

Answer to Demand for Release

Course of Administration.
MILITIA IS ON THE MOVE
First Units Entrain in Response
to "Speed Up" Orders From
Washington.
MEXICO CITY, Juno 26,
The foreign office made tho pos
itive declaration that work on
the Mexican reply to the Ameri
can note has not even been be
gun. It is impossible, officials said,
to forecast when the reply will
be ready for delivery.
It is generally believed it will
not be sent to Washington for
several days.
Pending' a "detailed 'report. fxdm
General Pershing onthc Carrizal
fight and a reply to the President's
flat demand on Carranza for the
release of United States prisoners,
the Administration is marking
time in the Mexican crisis.
Only a complete backdown by
Carranza can save the situation, is
the view taken by practically all
official Washington.
While President Wilson is plan
ning to go before Congress t,o put
up to the lawmakers the whole mat
ter, he will wait an answer from
Mexico or a further clash.
Border dispatches tell of the
massing of Pershing's troops, the
abondonment of the southernmost
base at Namiquipa, and preparation
all along the line either for defen
sive action or to back up the de
mand for the release of the caval
rymen held prisoners at Chihuahua
City.
NO CONFIRMATION.
No confirmation of this can bo had
at tho War Department, where nolhng
further hns been heard from Funston.
The "speed-up" orders sent to all
militia commanders is having Its effect,
nnd units of tho guard already are on
their way to thA border.
Tho report of Captain Morey. as ho
lay supposedly dying on tho Carrizal
desert, lndloatned to officials that tho
action of the American forco before
Corrlznl might havo been provocative.
Moroy wrote that Captain Boyd was
under tho Impression that tho Mexicans
would run when tho Americans fired.
"Wo formed for attack," said Morey's
report.
Tho Idea that Coptnin Boyd was at
least partly on tho aggressive was voiced
by n Cabinet offlcor today. He said,
however, ho felt the crux of the sitoy
tlon was In tho demands on Carranza,
and that now all depends on Carranza's
action regarding tho holding of Ameri
can prisoners and his future attitude to
ward tho 1'nlted Statca.
Tho publication of tho Amorican de
mauds for tho release of seventeen
American prlHoners from Chihuahua
showed thnt Corrnnza had Issued the or
der to General Trevlno not to permit tho

This would place upon Carranza tho
