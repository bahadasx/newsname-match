1 wish to express my heartiest and
most unstinted admiration for the
character and aervlcoa of the men and
' i women who made up the Progressive
'J national convention In 1016. 1 cai
' give ih ? ?n higher praise than Ic
' "ay that In all respects they 'toad
' level with the men and women who In
1912 lolned at Chicago to found the
f> Progressive I'arty. These two ran.
b venllons. In character. In disinterest.
edneaa. In vision, In insight. In high
I purpose, and In desire to ronder prnc,
Ileal service to the people, typified
, exactly what such bodies ought to be
, In a great self-governing democracy.:
, They represented tho spirit which
moved Abraham Lincoln and hie political
associates during the decade
precodlng the close of the Civil War.
The platform put rorth In 1012 was
; much the mn?t iiMvirtBn"
| document promulgated In thla roun- I
iry alnce the death of Abraham Lin I
coin. It repreaented the flrsl cffori I
on n large ?cale to tranalate ubatraci I
rormulaa of economic and aoclal Jua
tlce Into concrete American national
I lam; the effort to apply the prtMn^^l
of Waahlngton and Lincoln to th< I
| need of the United States In the I
' twentieth century. No flner effort I
wan ever made to servo the American I
people. In a aplrlt of high loyalty to
all that la loftiest tn the American
tradition.
Events hare nhown that the Pro- H
greaalve party In 1911 offered tha H
j only alternative to the triumph o(H
the Democratic party. Moreover, H
! these events have shown that the ap-^H
plication of the principles which wel
; then advocated Is even more neoe?*^H
sary to this nation than we at theH
time supposed. H
The reaults of the terrible worldH
war of the past two years have; now^H
made it evident to all who are willlngH
to see, that In this country there mnst^H
be aplrltusl and Industrial prepard-S
neas, along the lines ot efficiency, ol^H
loyal service to the nation, and eflH
; practical application of the precept^H
that each man moat be hla brother'i^fl
keeper. Furthermore. It la no lee^B
evident, that thla prepardneaa for th^B
taaka of peace forma the only soum^H
baala for that Indlapenaable mllltar^H
preparedneaa which reata on unlvorna^|
military training, and which flndaaa^H
p react on In nntveraal obligatory aerH
vice In time of war. Such unlvcmn^H

the neeeiaaiy complementa of unlver^H
aal suffrage, and ropreaent the reallH
cation of the true American, the dc^H

Sooner or later the national prlndfl

of 1912 mult IB their general effecH

I shall continue to work for tbesB
great Ideals, shoulder to shouldtHfl
with the men and women who In 19lH
championed them; and I am surethi^H
these men and women will show
