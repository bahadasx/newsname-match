Columbus, N. M., June
26. A report was in cir
culation here today that
another clash of American
and Carranzista troops
had occurred near Villa
Ahumada, but army offi
cers here have not con
firmed it.
El Paso, Tex., June 26.
Mexican officials in EI
Paso and Juarez said to
day they had heard noth
ing of any fighting at Villa
Ahumada or any other
point.
II Paso. Texas, Jnne 26. Gen
eral John J. Pershing's pnnitive
expeditionary force is read for
action if action is necessary.
Today, according to the best in
formation here.' his southernmost
outpost is near tl Valle, less than
0 miles from ( olonia Nubian,
the main base. It is believed that
from 11 Valle a lanre and mnhile
force mar he pointed eastward in
a strategic position toward the
Mexican Central railroad, l'crsh
inir's men number about 12.1)00.
Equipment is in excellent condi
tion. Horses and mules have been
tested until only the fit remain. Big
motor trains loaded with necessary
supplies for an advance are lined up !
Tnere is not a single wounded or ;
incapacitated man with the force.
Every empty truck which remained at
Columbus has been sent to the front
to aid in the speedy transportation of
infantry.
Five thousand national guardsmen
are expected in El Paso today.
Andres Garcia, Mexican consul at
El Paso, said today:
"I do not see that there need be

ident Wilson's last note. These 17
prisoners ought not offer an obsta

El Paso. Texas, June 26. Carranza
troops m northern Chihuahua are be

Mexican Central railroad between
Juarez and Chihuahua City, accord

These messages said mat eight troop
trains parked with soldiers to be dis
tributed between Villa Ahumada and
Laguna lft the state capital last
night. Military men assume that in
the event of hostilities the Carranzis-
tas contemplate holding the railroad
the main arterv of transportation
from the border to the interior.

Other reports indicated that Gen-
eral Pershing's expeditionary com -
mand
les-s than 50 miles to the west
has bef-n drawn into a parallel line
exiendiLg up the lianta Maria valley
from K! Valle to Columbus, N. M.
Large Mexican forces are being gath
ered at Villa Ahumada and at Monte
zuma, while General Pershing has his
larzesi forces at El Valle and Colonia
Dublan.
Between tho two lines, each about
200 mi!-s long, both American and
Me.xi. ar, ava!ry scouting patrols are
operating. It was feared that some of
these patrols might clash and precip
itate general hostilities. With reports
that thousands of people in northern
Mexico arc on the verge of starvation,
apprehension was also expressed that
tome of the natives might attack an
American motor supply train.

French Capture Part of Ene

FOE N EARING VERDUN
Kaiser's Soldiers Now With

Mile of City.
Paris, June 26, (3:45 a. m.) In
night attack the French captured part
of a German trench between Fumin
and Cheno:s woods in the Verdun sec
tor. A German attack west of Thiau
mont was repulsed, according to an
official statement issued by the French
war office today. A heavy artillery
duel is in progress west of the Meuse.
The text:
"In the Argonne an enemy attack
upon one of our small posts at La
Fille Morte was repulsed with hand
grenades.
"On the left bank of the Heuse the
artillery duel was particularly lively
in the region of Dead Man's Hill.
"On the right bank a German at
tack delivered last night upon our
positions west of Thiaumont works
was completely checked by our in
fantry and artillery fire. During a lo
cal operation between the woods of
Fumin and Chenois, we seized some
elements of the German trenches. In
other sectors there were artillery ac
tions. "In the rest of the front the night
was calm."
Within Mile of Verdnn.
The Germans are now three-quarters
of a mile from the French lines
immediately in front of Verdun but no
operation has as yet been undertaken
elsewhere to relieve pressure on the
citadel.
Last night's French official state
ment says:
"No important event beyond the us
ual cannonade to record on the rest
of the front."
This is taken to show that the
French command, viewing the situa-
i tion as a stategic whole looks on the
i tactical success of the Germans on the
right bank of the Meuse as of but mo
mentary sigficance.
LATIN-AMERICAS
NOT TO MEDIATE
Washington, June 26. South and
Central American republics will not
offer mediation to the United States in
the Mexican crisis at this time. This
announcement was made late today by
Minister Calderon of Bolivia, after a
conference with Secretary Lansing.
Minister Calderon said he had been
informed by the secretary that the
United States considered this was not
the time for mediation. The minister
added, however, that the Latin-American
countries might consider the sub
ject again after the United States bad
received a reply to its note to lie de
facto fiovenuiient ui Mexico.
CASEMENT AGAIN
PLACED ON TRIAL
Chief of Sinn Feiners in Legal Battle
for His Life On High Treason
Charge of England.
London, June 26. Sir Roger Case
ment, chief conspirator in the Sinn
Fein revolt in Ireland, faces trial to
day for his life on a charge of high
treason in the high court of justice.
Sir Roger Casement has been in jail
since April 25 when he was captured
H on the west coast or Ireland after
having been landed from a German
steamer attempting to run the British
blockade and land arms in Ireland for
the projected revolution.
Up to a year before the war broke
out Casement had been in the British
consular service in which he served
a total of 18 years.
The trial began at 10:30 o'clock this
morning.
The little courtroom is about the
size of the room of the supreme court
in Washington. Like most courts its
ventilation is defective. The judges'
bench runs along one side with the
high iron rails, docks and the jurors
box flanking ;t on the left and right.
The lawyers sit at tables, well back
of which rise half a dozen rows of
benches which today were filled with
barristers in white wigs and black
gowns and with a large number of
newspaper men. Above is a small gal
lery which was filled with spectators.
Over the dock, in a small balcony, were
half a dozen women, including the
wife of the chief justice.
Viscount Reading, the lord chief
justice and Justices Avory and Hor
ridge, in bright scarlet robes and
powdered wigs, took their seats, the
case was called and Sir Roger was
brought in. The prisoner was pale.
His black hair and beard were neatly
trimmed and he wore a black cutaway
and a black tie, with a white band in
his waist coat collar.
Sir Roger bowed to the justices and
the chief justice returned the saluta
tion with equal formality. The pris
oner stood leaning on the iron railing
with folded arms while the clerk rean
the long indictment.
The indictment followed in legal
points that returned against Colonel
Arthur Lynch, who fought against the
British in the Boer war. When asked
if he was guilty or not guilty, Sir Rog
er bowed and murmured something
which was inaudible. His chief coun-
se, Alexander Sullivan of Dublin, arose
quickly and answered that the indict
ment set forth was "no offense knowu
to the law," and that none of the acts
specified was alleged to have taken
place in any territory over which the
king has any jurisdiction. Alter con
sultation the court ruled that any ex
ceptions to the indictment in a case
of such importance could be taken af
ter the hearing without prejudice to
the prisoner.
Then Sir Roger made a formal plea
of not guilty, speaking in firm tones.
Jurors from the panel were called for
ward. .
After 11 Jurors had been seated in
the box there was great difficulty in
finding the twelfth. The defense chal
lenged for cause more than a dozen in
succession. At 11:10 o'clock the jury
was completed.
The jury is composed of middle aged
men, apparently of the small merchant
and clerk class. Samuel Saunders,
being a Jew, took the oath with his hat
on bat had to repeat it because he held
the testament in his left hand instead
nf the right. The jury was sworn
thi-oA-nnarters of an hour after the
court sat.
FRANCE TAKES DOWN
EMBARGO ON AUTOS
Paris, June 26. A government de
cree withdrawing the recent order pro
hibiting the importation of automo
biles into France and making certain
modifications in the customs dues, was
fuhUhed. today In the official Journal
23Are$lam
in Carrizal
ClasKClaim
Washington. June 26. Report
ing today the rescue of Captain
Lewis Morey and four troopers,
.Major Jenkins of the- Eleventh
cavalry, heading the relief column,
announced that tne country near
Carrizal had beon thoroughly cov
ered and no further survivors of
the fight there found.
Field Headquarters, Mexico, June 25,
(by wireless to Columbus, N. M., June
26.) Twenty-three American soldiers
are known to have been killed in the
Carrizal battle, according to a report
to General Pershing tonight from
Major Jenkins, commanding the Elev
enth cavalry column ordered to scour
the country for survivors.
The renort told of the rescue in
safety of Captain Lewis S. Morey, after
he had made a daring stand against
heavy Mexican odds and heroic per
sonal sacrifices in an effort to save tne
lives of his men. Major Jenkins said
be had evidence that nine American
troopers, in addition to those previ
ously reported dead, had been killed.
A note found on the body of Captain
Charles T. Boyd, the American com
mander who lost his life, proved that
General Felix Gomez, the Mexican
commander, invited him into the town
of Carrizal, and that he had refused
and afterward conferred with Gomez
outside the town. Neither the note
book of Captain Boyd nor that of Cap
tain Morev. both of which were recov
pred. threw any new light on the
clash.
After the first firing K troop, under
CaDtain Morey's command, took refuge
(in a nearby adobe, but, Major Jenkins
reported, realizing their preaicameui,
he ordered his men to leave the hut in
small detachments.
Captain Morey, himself suffering
with slight wounds, with four men, re
mained throughout the day in the
house, which was within 2,000 yards
of the Carranzista line.
That night, the party of four started
afoot in an attempt to get back to the
expeditionary command. Captain
Morey soon became so weak irom loss
of blood that he was unable to walk
and believing he was dying, he ordered
his men to leave him and save them-
This they did but shortly the wound
ed officer managed to rally enough
strength to crawl to the ranch house
of an American named McCabe, about
nine miles from Carrizal.
Major Jenkins reported he found
Captain Morey hidden in McCabe's
house and that his wounds were not
dangerous. Upon receipt of the dis
patch, General Pershing said 43 mem
bers of the command engaged had been
accounted for and that one other is
lost in the desert. The remainder of
the 84 men who made up the detach
ment are believed to have been killed
or made prisoners.
THE WAR TODAY
The Austrians have definitely
abandoned their offensive in the
southern Tyrol and are falling, ac
cording to today's reports from the
Italian front. Evidences of a de
cided flagging in the Austrian ag
gressive, which began to appear
when the Russian offensive in the
east got under headway, are now
supplemented by Rome's an
nouncement that the Anstrians are
retreating along a front of some
twenty miles in the Asiago sec
tor. The Italians are keeping up a
vigorous pursuit.
The Verdun battle, by all ac
counts now in crucial stage, was
continued last night with new as
saults by the Germans west of the
Thianmont works, north of the
town. The French artillery and in
fantry fire, however, completely
stopped the German attempt to
advance down the Froi de Terre
ridge, according to the Paris war
office.
The French themselves claim to
have captured portions of trenches
between the Fumin and Chenois
woods northeast of Fort de Son
ville. Probably preparatory to an ef
fort to bring their lines west of
the Meuse up to those on the east
bank the Germans are vigorously
bombarding French positions in
the former sector. The artillery
tire is especially vigorous in the
neighborhood of lead Man's Hill.
The Russians have captured all
of Bukowina from the Austrians
who are retreating toward the Car
pathians' passes. Along the river
l'ruth the Russians also inUictcd
heavy losses npon the Austrians
in men taken prisoners and in war
stores left behind in the retreat.
The Russians also report the re
pulse of attacks southwest of Lutsk
and an advance north of Radzivil
off, while Berlin claims to have put
down Russian attacks east of Vlad-imir-Volhynla
and west of Dubno.
Heavy fighting continues through
out this region. The greatest bat
tie of the present series on this
front seems to be developing In the
Lutsk region, according to Petro
grad. The key to the whole situa
tion is the kovel junction, and tre
mendous efforts are being made by
the Germans to safeguard this vital
point.
The general opinion in Paris is
that the establishment of the Ger
mans at Hcury Is regrettable"
owing to the close proximity of
that point to Verdun. Activity of
the artillery Is very ucthe between
the British and Germans on the
Belgian front.
WILSON PUTS
DECISION TO
MEXICO CHIEF
Reply to United States Ulti
matum to Decide the
Border Situation.
NOTE IS RECEIVED
Arrival of Document at Cap
ital City Is Announced
by Agent Rodgers. .j
Washington. Jnne 26. Secretary
Lansing's note to the de facto
government reached Mexico City
last night and Special Agent Rod
gers arranged to deliver it im
mediately. This was reported in
a cablegram from Mr. Rodgers
sent last night and received to
day. There was nothing in the mes
sage to indicate how the demand
for the release of the prisoners
taken at Carrizal and for a dec
laration of policy by Carranza
was received or when a reply
might be expected.
Whether a state of war shall exist
between the United States and the de
facto government of Mexico, depends
upon the formal declaration of policy
by General Carranza, expected hourly
today in response to the note tele
graphed to Mexico City yesterday by
Secretary Lansing.
The American government will in
sist upon immediate release of the cav
alrymen captured at Carrizal, as de
manded in the note but high officials
of the administration explain in inter
preting the communication that the
course of the United States will be de
termined by Carranza's final statement
4of his intentions toward the American
expedition in Mexico to protect the
border.
The war department had not re
ceived at an early hour the letter from
Captain Lewis S. Morey of the Tenth
cavalry giving the first official Ameri
can version of the fighting at CarrizaL
The published text of Captain Mor
ey's letter was construed as indicat
ing that the American force was to
some extent responsible for the clash.
Secretary Lansing's note, however,
did not found its demands upon a state
ment that the Mexicans precipitated
the fight Apparently, the question has
no direct connection with the course
President Wilson is pursuing. The
Mexican note saying General Car
ranza personally directed that General
Trevino resist any movement of Amer
ican troops in Mexico except in retire
ment toward the border is the real
issue.
The Washington government con
strues this action as a formal avowal
of deliberately hostile action. It de
mands that if this is Carranza s pur
pose, he so state through reglar diplo--
rnatic channels.
Members of congress wede informed
of all phases of the situation during
the day by the chairmen of the foreign
affairs committees, who had a long
conference with the president last
night The president then indicated
that he might desire to address tha
house and senate soon but no steps to
ward arranging for a joint session will
be taken until the Carranza reply is
received.
Speed Up Mobilization.
Speeding up of the mobilization of
national guardsmen was reported to
the war department today from nearly
all states and word was expected mo
mentarily by the militia division that
contingents had started for the bor
der. Major General Leonard Wood, com
manding the eastern department said
he expected several New York and
Massachusetts, regiments ready to
start during the day.
More than 1,000 Missouri guardsmen
were reported to have been mustered
into federal service. Tbey were first
to actually take the United States oath,
since one company of the Oregon guanj
qualified.
General Scott, chief of staff, said
elaborate and smoothly working ma
chinery was in operation to expedite
transportation south. Troop and sup
ply trains have the right of way, even
to side-tracking limited passenger
trains.
The quartermaster general has
charge of the transportation, aided by
railroad agents of the American Rail
way association stationed constantly at
tne war department
Physical examination and lack ot
equipment is delaying militia of some
states.
Funston Decides Destinations.
War department officials said they
would not be advised of the actual
movement of militia contingents prob
ably until after some were en route.
Their destination will be determined
solely by General Funston. The mil
itia division was advised today that
Illinois guard was two-third enrolled,
that Kansas guardsmen were muster
ing with practically all in camp and
that Ohio's complement would be mob
ilized completely tomorrow. The Wis
consin guard was reported not yet
mustered.
Other state forces reported mobilized
today include Indiana. Michigan, Wy
oming, Colorado, South Dakota and
1 Minnesota, and ldiiho.
