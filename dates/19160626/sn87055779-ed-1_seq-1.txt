to Gen. Triivino at Chihuahua City

Encouraging reports from other

BULLETIN.
Iliteriiiitional New S,rvle:
WASHINGTON, June 26. The efforts of the Latin-American
powers to arrange mediation between the United States and the
de facto government of Mexico, ended in failure this afternoon.
Following a conference between Minister Calderon of Bolivia,
who stated that he represented all of the Latin-American nations,
and Sec'y of State Lansing, the Bolivian representative admitted
that his efforts to get the United States to agree to submitting the
questions at isue to a "conference of neutrals" had absolutely
failed.
WASHINGTON, June 26. While Sec y of State Lansing and
Minister Caldron of Bolivia were in session this afternoon con
sidering the tender of mediation on behalf of the Latin-American
powers rumors were in circulation in the various South and Cen
tral American embassies and legations that there was a ''decided
improvement" in the situation in Mexico City. These rumors took
the form of intimations that the pressure upon Carranza was such
that he was now disposed to agree to concessions to meet the view
point of the United States providing he could "be assured that the
Latin-Americans, in all mediation
eignty of Mexico must be respected.
WASHINGTON. Tune 26. Pres't
Wilson will place the entire Mexican
situation before congress at r. special
joint session to be .held Wednesday
at noon unless in the meantime (Jen.
Carranza meets the views of the
United States. Whether the presi
dent at this time will ask for a flat
declaration of war on the le f.icto
government of Mexico, or will sa
gest passage of a resolution such as
was adopted at the time of the Vera
Cruz incident permitting him to uti
lize the armed forces of the govern
ment to enforce decrees of the state
department has not yet been de
cided. The legal authorities of the
state department today are consider
ing this question. Congress will fol
low any plan that the president sug
gests, the leaders said today.
The administration expets the
Carranza reply to its latest ultima
tum demanding the release of tbe
troopers now held prisoners at Chi
huahua City not later than tomor
row. Present indications are that t
will either be a Hat refusal or an
evasion . although strong pressure
is rejort'd being brought to be:r
upon Carranza by the Latin-Ameii-can
diplomats in Mexico City to me-t
the views of the United States and so
prevent war. A refuaa' -aIi! p p ilt
in an immediate rail for the joint
s'-sj'on which the president has al
ready assured th" congressional
leaders he desires. And as indicat-l
inj? that it is a'.most certain to be
held, conferences were in proure-
in the capitol today between the
leader::- arranging the general de
tails. The advocates of th flat derb,
ration of war have made it plain to
the president that in o "der to enforce
an air tight, water tight biuci.au
of Mexican territory, a complete
break between the two nations in'.-t
come. International law will not
sanction such a blockad which it
Is now agreed must be one of the
chi-f moves to bring Carranza to
terms unless war has been declared
and all branches of the jfovernm-nt
now are ery anxious that ew-ry lim
itation of International law he scru
pulously observed beause of the
European situation a;.d the co:n;dl-
cations thi government
had in
that onnection. The state departm
ment letral exerts, howe'. er, are ex
