Columbus, X. M., Jane 26.) This biff
camp, 'which is growing bigger every
day. has been moved again that is to
sav in the provision of room for added
increments, it has been found necessary
or deemed wise, to move the headquar
ters from the beautiful grove on the

out much travel, in our pajamas and .

tensity, the thermometer often regis
tering 110 to 115 degrees above zero in
tite sun for several hours at a time.
Little Humidity.
But it is not so enervating as the
figures would indicate to a reader who
may live where the percentage of hu
midity is higher than it is here at an
elevation of 5609 feet above sea level.
In spite of the beat registered during
the daytime, the nights are cool, not to
say cold, and refreshing sleep, under
as many blankets as we were used to in
the winter time, is possible. That makes
it easier to stand the heat and it fur
nishes the most potent reason for the
splendid health of the men in this
and other camps along the lines occu
pied by the American forces.
Still Digging.
The changing of the lines of the
camp has made it necessary that much
new trenching be done in order that all
emergencies be provided against, and it
is being done in a manner calculated to
make the camp practically impregna
ble against any but a force many times
our number and well supplied witi ar
tillery.
To provide for the health of the men
occupying the newer portions of the
camp, many nc wells haVe been dug
and
pumps anyen, or otherwise in-
stalled.
from which
an abundance of ,
splendid water for culinary and ablu-
tlonarv purposes is being secured.
New Possibilities Opened Up.
The sinking and driving of these
wells is demonstrating the presence at
comparatively shallow depths of an
abundance of water which, when peace
If restored, may be brought to the sur
face at small cost for irrigating pur
poses. The probable effect of this will
be to convert the whole of the great
plain upon which the towns of Nuevas
Cases Grandes and Colonia Dublan are
located into grain fields, vineyards, or- '.
chards and gardens and the homes of
thousands of happy and contented men, I
women and children.
Whether those contented settlers and
tillers of the soil will be Mexicans or
members of other races will depend
upon so man) things that a discussion
of that particular phase of the question
would be out of place at this moment
What Mormons Have Done.
The Mormons, who occupy several
thousands of acres in this valley, have
Spent many thousands of dollars in the
development of water for irrigation
the only result obtained therefrom, up
to the present time, being the creation
of two or three large artificial bodies
of water, locally known as the 'Mor
mon lakes.'"
Had it not been for the beginning of
the revolutionary era, five or six years '
ago. the water gathered from a large '
drainage area into the basins now
overflowed by the "Mormon lakes
would long since have been carried
through acequias to the farms of those
who had contributed to the cost of the
water development and the valley
would be much better developed along
agricultural lines than it is at present
Chean Power Then Unknown.
When the development of the lakes
was oegun. the idea of irrigating by
means of pumps was not thought prac
ticable. Since that time the crude oil
engine has been perfected to a point
where water may be prought to the
surface in large quantities at very
small cost and has made possible the
reclamation of sections of country such
as this, with water but a few feet be
low tne grass roots.
Good Roads Being Developed.

Reports brought to the border from
Villa Ahumada Sunday night say that
the forces which left Juarez Thursday
and Friday are detraining at Ahumada
and the troops are digging in west and
north of the town. Villa Ahumada
is a squat little adobe town Get down

the town, dry washes and arroyas from
the mountains cutting the railroad line
north and south of the town and tanks,
or small lakes, fed by the irrigation

the town Is laid out in such a way that
It could be defended against a force
of Infantry, it would not be able to
hold out long against artillery, Amer

declare, as it could be razed without
more than an hour of bombardment

the operation of these guns in Mexico
is said to be that the machine gun

Poor Ammunition.
The greatest weakness in the artil

FOB FOUR DAYS
Says Will Take Until Thurs
day to Get Ready; No
Declaration of War.
A let of a box of cigars was made
Sunday night by two well informed
Americans that there would be no
break with Mexico before Thursday.
The man betting that nothing would
happen before Thursday reasoned that
it would require that long to set the
militia to the border, to take the
Americans out of Veracruz and Tam
pico, to permit the Mexican situation
to be presented to congress and to al
low time for the formalities Incident to
the breaking off of International re
lations. No Declaration of War.
The American also stated that the
United States would not declare war
on Mexico but would accept the Carri
zal attack on American troops as a de
liberate act of war on the part of
Mexico, if accepted by Carranza as
having been done under the orders of
bis government. This, it was said,
would be sufficient to begin military
operations in northern Mexico and that
there would ,be no declaration of war
and the northern row of states would
then be occupied by American troops
as western Chihuahua has been by
Pershing's column.
Fight at Villa Ahumada.
The first fight, he said, would occur
at Villa Ahumada where the Carranza
opposition would be swept aside and.
after Gen. Bell and Gen. Pershing had
formed a junction south of Ahumada
with their two columns, the selge and
attack on Chihuahua would then be
started. From Chihuahua the pursuit
