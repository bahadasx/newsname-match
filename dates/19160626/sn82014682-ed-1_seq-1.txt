"Matters Now Pending

; t. - ,
When the territorial grand Jury
meets at 2 o'clock on the afternoon of
Wednesday, July 5, the first meeting
in nearly four months, one of the cases
to be laid before it for Investigation
will be that of Tesse Gray, former po
lice officer at Wahiawa, who was dis
missed by the civil service commis
sion, according to the plans of City
Attorney A. M. Brown.
"The Investigation will be for the
purpose of determining whether Gray
should be .criminally prosecuted," says
I Attorney Brown. "The civil service
commission evidently considered the
charges against him true, as it dis
missed him, and if the grand jury be
lieves, the same way an indictment Jn
the matter probably would charge
Gray, as a public official, with accept

from Honolulu brought joy to a lone
ly soldiecitperator In . the ; trenches
of France where he had not heard
from home, in many.; months is told In
a, letter from H. A. Oxenham, former

Oxenaam, who has many friends in
Honolulu, left for the front in May,

One night a month or tio ago, ac
cording to the letter, Oxenham was
sitting with the wireless head gear on
listening to messages and orders that
were being sent along the front. In
the distance he could hear the ramble
of the heavy guns and the crackle of
rifles and machine suns. As he sat
listening - to the night, sounds his
thoughts strayed to Honolulu, and, as
if In answer, out of the sky, he heard
the office here sending to San Fran
cisco. It came clear as a bell and he
recognized the sending of his friend
McQuade. He longed to answer but
it was impossible because he was only
using a field outfit. Nevertheless, to
hear from home brought joy to' his
heart and showed- him that he, at I
least, was not cut off fiom the outside
