Pershing sent Funston Information
taken from the note book found on
the body of Captain Charles Boyd,
commander of the American expedi

book contained carbon copies of the
note sent to the Mexican jefe at Car

through th® town, and of the note
sent to Pershing telling him of the
plan to go on to Villa Ahumda. The
original note from General Felix
Gomez, Carranza commander, inviting
Boyd's command into the town for a

EL PASO, -The
border today awaited the last diplo
matic moves before the war is form
ally begun. Convinced that war Is
inevitable, immediate interest center
ed in the withdrawal of the expedi
tion's advanced base from Namiquipa
to El Valle and in Carranza's reply
to President Wilson's latest demands.
Should Carranza concede the de
mands, he will meet Francisco Ma
dero's fate, in the opinion of those
familiar with the situation.
Gen. George Bell, Jr., i-as pitched
several camps in El Paso to protect
the city from surprise attack on any
quarter. There are less than 200
armed soldiers in Juarez, but 1,000
Mexican pvkets are also doing picket
duty along the boundary line.
Seven wounded American soldiers
taken to Fort Bliss last night from
Columbus? brought the total number
now in the fort hospital as the result
of Mexican sniping to twenty. The
wounded state that organized bands
of snipers were encountered all along
the communication lines. Their fire
has always been returned, but with
what effect is not learned.
Aeroplane In Use.
COLUMBUS, N. M. June 26.—For
the first time since April 22, an aero
plane is at General Pershing's head
quarters, fit for performing scouting
duty. A military aeroplane driven by
Lieutenants Christy and Rice and
carrying an observer, made the flight
from Columbus to field headquarters
early today. It's safe arrival was re
ported by wireless.
Huge quantities of military cup
plies were being unloaded at the local
base today. Incoming motor trucks
were hastily repaired and immediate
ly sent out with supplies for the ex
peditionary forces.
Mexicans have set prairie fires in
the dry grass around American camps
in Mexico, presumably to hinder the
United States troops. Where the
flames threaten damage, details of sol

SIR ROGER YAWNS IN COURT
WHILE BEING TRIED FORTREASON
Plea of Not Guilty is Entered
by Man at Head of the
Irish Revolution.
[By Wilbur S. Forrest, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
LONDON, June 26.—In a firm voice,
Sir Roger Casement, today pleaded not
guilty to the charge of high, treason
at the opening of his trial before Lord
Chief Justice Reading and Associate
Justices Avery and Harridge. A jury
was obtained from a special panel of
150 talesmen In less than one hour.
Casement today was scarcely the
same man who appeared at the pre
liminary arraignment in Bow street
Police court. Then, his fceard sadly
needed trimming, his hair was frowsy
and he wore an ill-fitting sack suit.
When he was brought over this morn
ing from Brixton prison to which he
had been removed from the Tower of
London, he wore a carefully brushed
monthly coat and Immaculate linen.
His beard sad hair were carefully
trimmed.
The prisoner smiled and nodded to
several acquaintances as he entered.
He listened calmly while the clerk
read the lengthy charge, reciting his
activities in connection with the Irish
rebellion and his- attempts to induce
Irish soldiers, prisoners in Germany,
to desert from the British army. He
displayed keen interst in the pre
liminary proceedings, watching his
counsel, Michael Doyle of Philadil
phia, closely.
Daniel Bailey, an Irish soldier ar
raigned with Casement at the pre
liminary hearing, will be tried sepa
rately. It is believed he will receive
lenient treatment because of the evi
dence he furnished the crown.
There was no crowd around the
court because of the advance notice
that admission would be by ticket
alone.
Attorney Smith made an exhaus
tive opening statement, reciting Case
ment's nineteen years in the consular
and other services, his thorough
familiarity with government methods
and consequently his great personal
responsibilities. Casement listened,
appurfttitiy bored. He yawned several

Captain Morey's Report.
SAN ANTONIO, Texas, June 26.—A
little, grey, be-spectacled man whose
mild and studious bearing appears al
most incongruous in his army khaki,
was the center of interest in the
Mexican situ&tion early today.
That man was Captain Lewis S.
Morey, commanding troop K, Tenth
cavalry, who, while desperately
wounded and apparently dying, sent
General Pershing the first officer's re
port of the battle at Carrizal in which
many of his and Captain Charles
Boyd's troop men were slain by Car
ranzlsta soldiers. Morey wrote the
letter to Pershing while hiding in an
aryo, 2,000 yards from the scene of
the battle. When it was completed,
he dispatched it by three negro troop
ers who had taken refuge with him.
These three men were picked up by
troop M. of the Tenth, commanded by
Lieut. Henry A. Meyer Jr.
The letter was addressed to Mor
ey's immediate superior, the com
manding officer at Ojo FBderico. It is
believed Lieutenant Meyer «ent it to
Ojo Frederlco, from "where it was for
warded to Pershing. This would ex-

parently not delivered to Pershing by
Meyer when the latter returned to
camp with the stragglers he found atjL
San Luis ranch.
A wireless addressed to Morey's
last
night, read:
"Am back on line and all well." It
was signed "Sidney" and sent from
"somewhere in Mexico." General
Funston had received early today no
word of Morey's rescue. It is not
known whether Morey really had been
picked up by some of Pershing's
men or whether the wireless had
been written at the same time as the
letter, to allay Mrs. Morey's fears.
Meyer reported that the ''three un
wounded men with Morey carried
him about two miles after the
battle, that he became so weak from
the loss of blood, he could go no fur
ther and ordered them to leave him.
He had been shot hrough the
shoulder. The men thought he was
dying and obeyed. Their sense of lo
cation was rather vague and although

WASHINGTON, June 26.—A dou
ble responsibility for the Carrizal bat
tle appeared partly established to
day. It did not, however, place such
a burden on the American forces as
to assure peace. On the contrary, de
velopments so shaped themselves that
it appears likely President Wilson
may find it necessary to appear be
fore congress before the week ends.
Only a complete right about' face
by Carranza can save the situation.
The report of Captain Morey, as he
lay supposedly dying on the Carrizal
desert. Indicated to officials that the
action of the American force before
Carrizal, might have been provoca
tive.

Morey wrote* that CapfcalnBoyd" was
under the Impression that the Mexi
cans would run when the Americans
fired. "We formed for attack," said
Morey's report.
On the other hand, the publication
of the American demands for the re
lease of seventeen American prisoners
from Chihuahua showed that Carran
za had issued the order to General
Trevino not to permit the Americans
to move south, east or west.
This will place upon Carranza the
responsibility for the Mexicans firing
and perhaps prove the necessity for
Boyd's offensive.
Persons in touch with President
Wilson's views, said he would de
lay going before congress on a war
mission until Carranza had had time
to answer the American ultimatum.
The charge in this message that
Carranza had acted with hostility in
everything honorable in crder to do
everything short of sacrificing our
most sacred convictions in order to
secure the alignment unc.or one lead
ership of the forces opposed to the
continuance in power of Mr. Wilson
and the democratic party.
"Under these circumstances the
progressive national committee at
Chicago in January outlined our dirty
to seek common action with tie re
publican party. Six weeks Inter, on
March 9th, in my Trinidad stntement
I asked for a similar co-ubinaM'.n
assinst the democratic pa.**y. This
was in effect, the same statement that
I made in my telegram to ex-Senator
Jackson, pending the convention."
Rooeerveit declared he had made
similar statements to his friends and
nominee. The present administration advisers, but had emphasized that
during its three years life has been the outcome depended entirely on the

If it had not reolizod the nation's de-
mands for patriotism, the progres

their highest duty to place a ticket

The colonel declared cfharges that
bis statements were not made in
good faith, that he intended to-run as
a progressive unless nominated by
the republicans, were groundless and
that the progressives knew he meant
whait he said.
"In my judgment," he went on, "the
nomination of Mr. Hughes meets tie
conditions set forth in the statement
of progressive proclamation issued
last January, and in my own state
ments. Under existing conditions
nomination of a third ticket, would in
my judgment be merely a move in the
interest of the election of Mr. Wilson.
I regard Mr. Hughes as a man whose
