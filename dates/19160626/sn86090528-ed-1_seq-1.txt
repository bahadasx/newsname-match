ANXIOUS TO
JOIN LOCAL
COMPANY
Applications From Other Towns Received
by Hollingsworth 35 Chickasha
Men Ready -Public Meeting is
Manned forTbis Week
"Letters have come in from a mini
her of surrounding towns from men
who want to join a Chickasha compa
ny," Albert L. Hollingsworth stated
this morning. Among the towns men
tioned were Alex, Tattle, Prumright,
Oklahoma City and Pocasset.
"About thirty-five men have signi
fied their desire to join the proposed
Chickasha company and stick togeth
er," Mr. Hollingsworth said. "Many
more state that if there is to be any
thing doing, they want in on it too.
If war were declared tonight, we could
doubtless have the C5 men necessary
to organize by noon tomorrow. The
boys are many of them waiting to see
what is going to happen."
A public meeting is scheduled to be
held some time this week, a sort of
"patriotism meeting." to determine fur
ther the sentiment of Chickasha men.
"Of course anyone can get into the
first regiment by joining any compa
ny that happens to be needing men,"
the local organizer said, "'out by wait
ing to get into the second regiment,
we can all be in the same company."
The date for Chickasha's patriotism
meeting is to be settled tonight,
ing them into the interior and replac
C, A sweep into ing them with militiamen." The cam
paign may be delayed for a few days,
pending the arrival of the state sol
diers. ' ' '
A call for volunteers .will be one of
the first stops if Wilson decides war
cannot be avoided. The call Will be
for 2"0,000 men, it is thought, and six
months will be tho time required to
raise them.
If war does come, experts are not
contemplating a short campaign. It
will be a long war, with a few spec
tacular battles during the first few
months, then probably, five or ten'
years "of fighting guerrilla bands.
ATTACK ON
CONSULATE
DESCRIBED
By United Press.
Eagle Pass, Tex., June 2C The de
struction of the American Consulate
at Torren rm June 18 by Mexican
soldiers and civilians, led by the may
or, was described by sixteen Ameri
can refugees who arrived here today.
The refugees say they saw the may
or with troops, a military band and
three thousand citizens, march to the
consulate, shouting "Death to the grin
goes," and that they tore the Ameri
etin shield from the front of the build
ing and then demolished the structure
wilh its contents.
A mass meeting was held later on
the plaza of the town and the mayor
and other officials made speeches,
counselling violence to all Americans.
The British consul aided the Ameri
cans to escape and was furnished a
special train by Carranza military au
thorities. The train was not molested
en route to the, border. .,T,
Officers accompanying the tfain that
carried the refugees said eight thous
and Mexican soliders were mobilized
at Sadinas, seventy miles south of
here where they would make Iheir first
s, and in case of an American invasion.

Chickasha did her part in cheering
the national guard and bidding them
Godspeed on their way to the border
yesterday when four trains passed
through the city en route to the new
mobilization camp at Fort Sill. The
first troop train arrived on the Frisco
at five o'clock yesterday afternoon.
Another passed' over the same road at
7:2(1, and another at 8:4.". One train,
ontalning eleven ears, came to tho
Y" north of town on the Rock Island
at 3:57 and went on west on the Man-
gum branch by way t)f Anadurko.
A large crowd, containing several
hundred people, met the firs rviseo
train, which came in with the military
band playing national airs and with
four companies of jolly, cheering
guardsmen. The soldier boys met a
welcome such as they had been meet
ing at every stop in the trip to. camp.
The train contained Companies A, B,
and D, coming from Oklahoma City,
Tulsa, Chandler and Newkirk. On the
train also were the regimental staff.
Including Adjutant General Frank M.
anion and Major Charles F. Barrett,
and the regimental Vd.
It was evident that the guardsmen
were anxious to get to camp where
drilling will begin, and anxious for the
action that may follow from the greut
demonstration of cheering and yelling
with which they greeted the Chicka
sha crowds.
Chickasha Boy on Board.
James Matthews, Chickasha lad and
member of the hospital corps, was
on Uie train, as was A. R. Bird, a for
mer Chickasha boy who had a place
in the band.
Flags were waved by dozens of peo
ple as the troop train stood for a few
minutes at the depot. Girls had flow.
ers to show the boys they were think
ing of them. "Thanks; I'll send you
my first Mexican scalp for this," said
one of the boys as he took the bou
quet. Everybody was in a joking
mood.
Flag is Presented.
Many people stayed at the Frisco do-
pot to see the second train go through
at 7:20, half an hour before the regu
lar-passenger came through. They
proved to he as jovial and happy a
rowd as the one that preceded them,
Veenlnsr un a continual hubbub of
cheers as far as they could be heard
by the people living in the southwest
outskirts of town. J. E. White met the
train with a huge flag. He presented
it to his nephew, a Muskogee lad.
Hundreds watched these men, who
are to be the defenders of t'ao border,
as they passed through in coaches,
but for the first time in years, no one
knows how long, a company of militia
marched down the street of Chickasha
just before 9 o'clock last night when
the third Frisco train arrived and the
men were detailed to downtown res
taurants for supper.
Restaurants !navded.
A total of 98 men, in khaki uniform,
belonging to the Durant company,
tramped down to Fourth street and
Chickasha avenue, then tney were
marched in smaller groups to the dif
ferent restaurants and given regular
lunch counter grub, probably the last
they will receive for many weeks, pos
sibly months.
It did not take long for crowds to
congregate along the side streets to
see the men pass. Automobiles fol
lowed them silently and men and boys
crowded about them in restaurants.
"Well, boys, I may never see you
again, but I want you all to hae a ci
gar to smoke after supper, one man
said down In Bill and John's as he
passed a can of cigars down the line.
"And you fellows remember that we're
all for you and we're all with you, and
when you want anything for youi selves
or the folks, just !t us know."
Included In the two companies were
men from Dustlu ami Okemah. the reg
imental Infirmary and the first sepa
rate troop of cavalry of Ukeiuuh. They
were hungry mid tirad from u Ionic ride
, and lucked ijiuch or the hilarious spirit
(showed by earlier companies.
Expect to See Service.
posplte the joyous, mood that cov
ered the feelings of the soldier boys, it
was evident that they Cully realized
the seriousness of their position.
Many of them stated that they did not
expect ever to get to the border.
Many other declared it was the com
mon opinion that about ten days
would be spent in drill, then they
would entrain again for the border, or
even for the interior of Mexico. At
Fort Sill they will take the new oath,
necessary under the law just passed
by congress. This law gives the presi
dent power to send the state militia
outside the borders of tho United
States.
Then other things besides mobili
sation camp and possibilities for war
held places In tho thoughts of guards
men. There were Jobs which muny
men feared would not wuiting for them
on the return. They did not hesitute
to speak these things. There were
other things of which none spoke.
They were mothers and wives and
sweethearts and friends left at home.
TWO CARS
IN HEAD-ON
COLLISION
Sam Cook's Ford Driven by W. A. Bates
Crashes Into Nichols' Delivery at
Crossing Both Machines Smash
edNo One Injured
A five dollars fine for one of the
drivers, and damage to both cars
amounting to about $.",0 resulted Sat
urday night when D. C. Nichols in his
delivery calami W. A. Bates In Sam
Cook's Ford met in a head-oh collision.
Bates drew the fine In police court this
morning under the charge of "drunk."
It all happened about 10 o'clock
Saturday night when Bates wan going
west on Choctaw avenue, and on the
left hand side of the street, according
to his own admission. Mr. Nichols
states that he saw him coming, but
that he did not expect to have any
dodging to do( until the cars were al
most together. He swerved hia car
sharply toward the middle of the
street and the two came together.
The absence of upending on the part
of either driver is all that prevented
a more serious accident, Mr. Nichols
thinks.

Chicago, June 20.--In a lengthy let
ter to the Progressive national com

on what he terms the necessity for
patriotic Americanism.
The Progressive national committee

actively urging the endorsement of
Hughes and the virtual abandonment
of the Moose organization while John

Lorfdon, June 2t. On the chargn
that he "did traitorously contrive ami
intend to aid tho enemy," Sir Roger
Casement today faced a Jury in his
trial for Life In the great Loudon law
courts. , . '
England's first high treason trial,
with two exceptions, for t;; years, drew
an enormous varl-peopled crowd In his
toric. Fleet street and around the an
cieut law courts many hours beforo
tho trial was scheduled to commence.
Men and women formed long Uuea
leading to the entrance ot the court
chamber, knowing that, perhaps nirut
out Of ten 'would never be granted the
privilege of seeing the noted defend
ant In the dock. Hundreds of the nior.
bidly curious, content to take a chaucit
on seeing Casement enter court on 'his
way from London Tower, 'waited on
the sidewalks and overflowed Into th
busy street. Strong contingents ot
London ''Bobbles," drawn from many
quarters of the city, had difficulty In
keeping the normal flow of motor
bases, taxicabs and all description of
vehicle from jamming above and be

Not since Parnell, Irish party leader'
in parliament, successfully defied tha
London Times, In 1887, to prove
charges of traitorous conduct against
him and thus put the party and a great
section of the Irish people on trial.
has such British public ititerest been
lent to a law proceeding Involving Ire
land. Parnell'o tftal stretched from
February to October. Casement
trial is expected to be finished in at
least three weeks.
A second trial for high treason In re
cent years, that of Col. Arthur Lynch,
a member of parliament, was only
little less uote.worthy. Lynch was
found guilty In 1!)03 of participating
in the Boer war. He was condemned
to death, but his sentnnce was eom
muted to life imprisonment. The fol
lowing year he was released on licensa
and In 1H07 he received a free pardon,
from the crown. Two years later he
re-entered parliament, where he sti ',
serves, as member from West Clare.
Long before Casement, accompanied
by his co-defendant, Daniel Julian Bai
ley, ex-British soldier, allttgod by king's
counsel to have been seduced luto
traltorism by Casement, entered tho
dock, the court chamber was crowded.
The dim religious light which bathed
the lofty walls of the court from
church-like windows cast a shadow
over the fashionably filled galiery in
the rear. Scores of women, soma In
tensely interested and others merely
curious, flocked to this gallery today.
They brought with them the latest
cuts in feminine raiment and smart
hats despite the wait. Frock coated
men juggled silk hats as the gallery
filled. Below, also in the rear of th
court another but less smartly dressed
crowd stood waiting for the trial to
begin. They were those who had form
