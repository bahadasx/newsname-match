Capt. Morey Rcscued
from Death in Desert
Tenth Cavalry Officer, Wounded at Carrizal, Is
Carried to Pershing's Camp by Troopers
After Sending in Report of Battle.
San Antonlo, Tex., June 25.?Captain Lewis S. Morey. ot Troop K,
10th Cavalry, who was wounded at the battle of Carri7.nl and was thought
to have been killed, after days of suffering has been rescucd from death
ln the desert.
Morey to-day reached the main hody of American troops with two
of his men. General Funston received a message by telephone to-night
from Mrs. Morey, wife of the captain, at Austin, Tcx., that she had had
n wireless message from him, "somewhere in Mexico," to that effect.
t'ntil word of his rescue was received here it was bclir-vd Morey
had perished. Three of his troopers had reached General Pershing's line
to-day. carrying a letter from Morey, in which he made a report of tho
Carrizal fight, saying the Mexicans had fired first.
The troopers told of having carried their wounded captain to a
point about two miles from the f-cene of the battle. There, with another
wounded trooper. they had hidden in a hole in the desert.
In this hiding place Morey wrote a report on the battle. Relieving
himself hopelessly wounded, he ordered the three unwounded troopers to
leave him and gave them the letter. They also believed he was dying, but
ubeyed hi? command.
Detachment Finds Three Men.
The three unwounded men were picked up by a detachment under
Lieutenant Harry A. Meyers, jr., of the 10th Cavalry, and the letter taken
to General F'ershing.

Text of President's Demand on Mexieo
Washingtnn, Jvnr 25.?The text of the note to the Mexican de facto govemment
tronamitted to-day to Jamrs Linn Rodgers, special reprcsentative of the American gov?
emment in Mexieo City, say3:
"Mr. Arrcdondo yesterday delivered to this govemment the following communlcation:
" 'I am dircctcd by my govemment to inform Your Excellency with refer
ence to the Carrizal incident that the Chief Exccutive, through the Mexican War
Department, gave orders to (ieneral Jacinto B. Trevino not to permit American
force. from (ieneral Pershing's column to advance further south nor to move
either east or west from the points where they are loeated and to oppose new in
curnonj of American soldiers into Mexican territory. These orders were brought
by (iener.'il Trevino to the attention of (ieneral Pershing, who acknowlcdged the
receipt of the conununication relative thereto.
"'On the _2d instant, as your Excellency knows. an American force moved
castward quite far from its base, notwithstanding the .ibove orders, and was en
gaged by Mexican troop. at Carrizal, State of Chihuahua. As a result of the en
counter several men on both sides were killed and wounded and seventecn Amer?
ican soldiers were made prisoners.'
"You are herehy instructed to hand to the Minister of Foreign Relations of the 'de
facto provornmont the following:
" 'The govemment of the United Statesenn put no other construction upon the
communication handed to the Secretaiy of State of the UnitedSUteton the 24th
day of June by Mr. Arrcdondo under instructions of your govemment than that it
is intended as a formal avowal of deliberately hostile action against the forces of
the lfnited Statea now in Mexieo and of the purpose to attack them without provo
cation whenever they ninvr from their present position in pnrsnance of the ob
jeeta for which they were sent there, notwithstanding the fact that those objects
not only involve no unfriendly intention toward the govemment and peopie of
Mexieo, but are, on the contrary, intended only to assist that govemment in pro
tecting itself .'ind the territory and peopie of the United States against irre
iponsible and insurgent bands of rebel marauders.
" 'I am instructed, thereforc. bv my govemment to demand the immediate re
lease of the prisoners taken in the encountcr at Carrizal, together witli any prop?
erty <>f the 1'nited States taken with them, and to inform you that the gov?
emment of the United States expeets an early statement from your govemment
as t<> th'' course of action it wishes the govemment of the I nited States to under
stand it has determined upon, and that it also expeets that this statement be
