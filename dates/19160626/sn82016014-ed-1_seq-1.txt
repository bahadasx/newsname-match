well as of the necessity for universal

Progressive party has done. -Our
strongest party antagonists have ac

ciples. Not Prepared for New Party. -.
"Yet it has become entirely evident
that the people under existing condi
tions are not prepared to accept a new
party. It is impossible for us Progres
sives to abandon our convictions. Bpt
we are faced with the fact that as
things actually are the Progressive na
tional organization no longer offers
the means whereby we can make these
convictions effective in our national
life. Under euch circumstances our
duty is to do the best we can and not
to sulk because our leadership is re
jected. It remains for us. good hu
moredly and with common sense, to
face the situation and endeavor to get
out of it the best that it can be made
to yield from the standpoint of the
interests of the nation as a whole.
This was the situation at the open
ing of the present year. It was clearly
evident that unless a cataclysm oc
curred, the presidential election would
result in the choice of either the Re-
nnhlican or the Democratic nominee.
The present administration, daring its
three years of life, has been guilty of
shortcomings, more signal than those
of any administration since the days
of Buchanan. From the standpoint
of national honor and interest, it stood
on an even lower level than the ad
ministration of Buchanan. No ad
ministration In our history has done
more to relax the spring of the na
tional will and to deaden the national
conscience. It was plainly our duty to
do everything honorable in order to se
cure the alignment under one leader
ship of the forces opposed to the con
tinuance in power of Mr. Wilson and
the Democratic party.
Urged Unity of Republicans.
"Under these circumstances the
Progressive national committee at
Chicago in January, outlined our duty
to seek combination with the Repub-
ican party.
"Six weeks later, on March 9, in my
Trinidad statement I asked for a sim
ilar combination against the Demo
cratic party. This was, in effect, the
same that I made in my telegram to
ex-Senator Jackson, pending the con
vention." To the Progressive National Com
mittee: Gentlemen: In accordance with the
message I sent to the Progressive na
tional convention as soon as I had re
ceived the notification that it had
nominated me for president, I now
communicate to you my reasons for
declining the honor which I so deeply
appreciate. Since the adjournment of
the convention. I have received be
tween two and three thousand letters
and telegrams from men who had sup
ported me for the nomination, the ma
jority expressing the def.ire that I
would refuse to run, while a minority
urged that I should accept the nomi
nation. As it is a physical impossi
bility to answer these letters and tele
grams individually, I beg of the cour
tesy of the senders that they will ac
cept this public statement in lieu of
such answers.
Before speaking of anything else, I
wish to express my heartiest and most
unstinted admiration for the charac
ter and services of the men and wom
en who made up the Progressive na
tional convention In 1916. I can give
them n- higher praise than to say
that in all respects they stood level
with the men and women who in 1912
joined at Chicago to found the Pro
gressive party. These two conven
tions, in character, in disinterested
ness, in vision, in insight, in high pur
pose, and in desire to render practi
cal servi.e to the people, typified ex
actly what such bodies ought to be in
a great self-governing democracy.

MURDOCH NAMED
Kansas Nominated by Progressives for
President.
Chicago, June 26. Amid riotous
scenes at the meeting of the Progres
sive national committee this afternoon.
Victor Murdock of Kansas was placed
in nomination for the presidency of
the Progressive ticket by Bainbridge
Colby
Colby's action followed the com
mittee's decision to accept Colonel
Roosevelt's declination of the nomi
nation as final. It was Colby, who
nominated Roosevelt at the Progres
sive convention.
Murdock's nomination was seconded
by Judge Norton of St. Louis. Ray
mond Robins, whow as chairman of
the convention leaped to his feet.
"Hove you Murdock's consent to
run?" he asked.
"No, but I haven't his refusal,
either," said Colby.
Robins then shoupted at Colby: "It
isn't true that you have planned to
support Woodrow Wilson?"
Colby said he had not and that any
body who said he had was a liar.
"I said you have." said Robins.
James A. Garfield of Ohio got the
floor and sought to convince the com
mittee against nomination of Mur
dock. Murdock is either in California or
en route to Chicago, Garfield said.
ROOSEVELT'S REASONS
"The platform (Progressive) put
forth in 1912 was much the most im
portant public document promulgated
in this country since the death of Ab
raham Lincoln."
"No finer effort was ever made to
serve the American people in a spirit
of high loyalty to all that is loftiest In
the American tradition."
"Events have shown that the Pro
gressive party in 1912 offered the only
alternative to the triumph of the Dem
ocratic party."
"The results of the terrible world
war of the past two years have now
made it evident to all who are willing
to see, that in this country there mus
be spiritual and industrial prepared
ness along the lines ff efficiency, of
loyal service to the nation, and of
practical application or the precept
that each man must be his brother's
keeper." -' ".'- --"
. "Sooner or later, the national prin
ciples championed by the Progres
sives of 1912 must. In their general
effect, be embodied in the structure of
our national existence."
"Our loyalty is to the fact, to the
principle, to the ideal, and not merely
to the name, and least of all to the
party name."
The Progressive movement has
been given an incalculable impetus by
what the Progressive party has done.'
"Much has been accomplished in
awakening the public to a better un
derstanding of the problems of social
and industrial welfare."
"But we are faced by the fact that
as things actually are, the Progressive
national Organization no longer offers
the means whereby we can make these
convictions effective in our national
life."
"Under such circumstances our duty
is to do the best we can, and not to
sulk because our leadership is re
jected." '
-It Is unpatriotic to refuse to do
the best possible merely because the
people have not put us in the position
to do what we regard as the very
best."
"The present administration during
its three years of life has been guilty
of shortcomings more signal than
those of any administration since the
days of Buchanan." .
"No administration in our history
had done more to relax the spring of
the national will and to deaden the
national conscience."
"In my judgment, the nomination of
Mr. Hughes meets the conditions set
forth in the statement or the Progres
sive national committee, issued last
January, and in my own statements."
"Under existing conditions, the
nomination of a third ticket would. In
my judgment, be merely a move in
the Interest of the election of Mr.
Wilson."
"No good American, whatever his
ancestry or creed, can have any feel
ing except scorn and detestation for
those professional German-Americans
who seek to make the American presi
dent in effect a viceroy of the German
emperor."
"It is folly to pay heed to any of
the promises in the platform on which
he now stands in view of the fact that
almost every important promise con
tained in the platform on which he

One regiment may leave mobilization
camp Friday. That statement was
made this morning by regular army
officers. .They control affairs at this
time.
Of course the officer in charge at
Fort Riley might receive a peremptory
order from the secretary of war to
entrain the troops immediately and
this order would be obeyed although
officers doubted if the secretary would
have power to issue such an order. The
law as it stands, officers declared, de

out and the men mustered in before
they can be removed from the state.
The governor cannot send the troops

according to information given out to
day. Then, too, there is the physical
examination of the men to be taken
into consideration. It takes from fif
teen to twenty minutes to examine
each man. There were 2,626 privates
and non-commissioned officers and
102 commissioned officers in camp
Sunday night. About twenty medical
corps officers are here to conduct the
examinations.
. Mustering Men In.
Nor is the task of filling out the
muster roles a light one. A complete
description of each man is taken in
addition to a history of his family
"from Adam down" to the present
day. The actual mustering and swear
ing of allegiance to the United States
government, consumes less time than
any other detail.
The mustering is proceeding, slowly,
it seems to the uninitiated. Tet army
officers at Fort Riley are vehement in
their insistence that it is progressing
with all possible expediency.
Meantime, war equipment for two
complete regiments has been ordered.
Some of it is now on its way to camp.

average infantry company is 65 men
and war strength is 150.
Officers Refuse to "Guess.
National guard officers are making
no conjecture as to the time of en
trainment. The guard is ready to go
at any moment. It all lies in the
government's hands. While the reg
ular officers are busy mustering the
men, guard officers are doing . every
thing possible to comply with a num
ber of telegraph requests from the
secretary of war to expedite arrange
ments for instant entramment.
Call in Recruiting Officers.
Orders were telegraphed to all re
cruiting officers Sunday to report at
mobilization camp. A majority of the
officers had arrived this morning. Ad

receipt of such an- order did not in- i

Thousands from all over the state,
mothers, wives and sweethearts, were
in the camp Sunday. The blistering
sun didn't detract an iota from their
enthusiasm. Nor were the Kansas
boys a bit sorry to see them.
Parade Before Sweethearts.
The gayly plumed pheasants in
Gage psrk never paraded with greater
pride than did the Kansas youths
Sunday before their wives, mothers
and sweethearts. They hazed each
other, played baseball, held a mock
burial of a bottle of "John Barley
corn" before a colonel's tent, danced
to the music of the band, displayed
their ter.ts with pride, pointed out
their officers and never tired of ex
plaining the thousand and one details
of the camp.
It was not a serious camp. True, a
soldier with a baby in his arms and
a tired wife by his side would tramp
up the hot, dusty camp streets with a
set look on his face. But such in
stances were rare.
The action of congress on a bill to
force married men from the service is
creating no little concern. In Battery
A alone there are thirty ,.ien with de
pendants on their hands, according to
a statement made by a battery officer.
