COLONEL ROOSEVELT
URGESPROGRESSIVES
TO SUPPORT HUGHES
Definitely Refuses Nomination in
Letter to Bull Moose National
Committee.
THREE PARTIES ARE
STILL EVIDENT TODAY
Colonel Bases Support Upon Necessity
for Patriotic American
Citizens.
(By United Press)
Chicago, June 26 Colonel Roose
velt today definitely refused the Pro
gressive nomination for president in
a letter to the Bull Moose committee,
urging them to support Hughes for
president He based his support up
on necessity for patriotic Americans
To State Committees.
Three parties were evident when
the Progressive national committee
met here today One faction favors
continuance, second faction iavors
Roosevelt's suggestions and the third
faction would submit the question to
state committees
Roosevelt's letter in part follows:
"I wish to extend my heartiest and
most unstinted admiration for the
character and services of the men and
women who made up the Progressive
nation convention in 1916 I can
give them no higher praise than to
say in all respects they stood level
with the men and women who in 1912
joined at Chicago to found the Pro
gressive party These two conven
tions, in character, in disinterested
ness, in vision, in insight, in high
purpose, and in desire to render prac
tical service to the people, typified ex
actly what such bodies ought to be in
a great self-governing democracy
They represented the spirit which
moved Abraham Lincoln and his poli
tical associates during the decade pre
ceding the close of the Civil War
No New Party.
"The Progressive movement has
been given an incalculable impetus by
what the Progressive* party has done
Our strongest party antagonists have
accepted and enacted into law, or
embodied in their party platforms,
very many of our important princi
ples Much has been accomplished in
awakening the public to a better un
derstanding of the problems of social
and industrial welfare.
"Yet it has become entirely evident
that the people under existing condi
tions are not prepared to accept a
third party
"It is impossible for us Progressives
to abandon our convictions But we
are faced with the fact that as things
actually are the Progressive national
organization no longer offers the
means whereby we can make these
convictions effective in our national
life Under such circumstances, our
duty is to do the best we can, and not
to sulk because our leadership is re
jected
Guilty of Shortcoming.
"The present administration, dur
ing its three years of hfs, has been
guilty of shortcomings more signal
than those of any administration since
the days of Buchanan From the
standpoint of national honor and in
terest, it stood on an even lower level
than the administration of Buchan
an No administration in our his
tory has done more to relax the
spring of the national will and to
deaden the national conscience.
Will Support Hughes.
"In my judgment, the nomination
of Mr Hughes meet the conditions
set torth in the statement of the Pro
gressive national committee, issued
last January, and in my own state
ments Under existing conditions,
the nomination of a third ticket
would, in my judgment, be merely a
move in the interest of the election
of Mr. Wilson. I regard Mr. Hughes
as a man whose public record is a
guarantee that 'he will not merely
stand for a program of clean-cut
straight-out Americanism before elec
tion, but will resolutely and in good
faith put it through if elected.' He.
is beyond all comparison better fitted
to be president than Mr Wilson. It
would be a grave detriment to the
country to re-elect Mr. Wilson I
shall, therefore, strongly support Mr
Hughes. Such being the case, it is
unnecessary to say' that I cannct ac
cept the nomination on a third ticket
I do not believe that there should be
a third ticket I believe that when
my fellow Progressives cocly con
sider the question they will for the
most part take this position They
and I have but one purposethe pur
pose to serve our common country
It is my deep conviction that at this
moment we can serve it only by sup-

SUNDAY'S EVENTS
REGARDING MEXICO
Washington officials make
public a note from Carranza
avowing responsibility for
Carrizal attack. Secretary
Lansing replied with an ulti
matum demanding the imme
diate release of American cap
tives, the return of property
and a definition by Carranza
of his position.
Major General Leonard
Wood arranges for the imme
diate dispatch to the border of
thousands of national guards.
Captain Morey of the Tenth
cavalry, which was ambushed,
arrived at the American lines,
after sending an account of
the battle while he thought
he was dying from wounds.
Carranza bars all Mexicans
from leaving the country on
account of military necessity.
CASEMENT PLEADS
NOT GUILTY AND
TREASONTRIALOPENS
(By United Press)
London, June 26On the charge
that he "did traitorously contrive and
intend to aid the enemy," Sir Roger
Casement today faced a jury in his
trial ior life in the great London law
courts
He entered a plea of not guilty and
a jury trom a special venire of 150
men was secured in less than an
hour
Enormous Crowd.
England's first high treason trial,
with two exceptions, for 65 years,
drew an enormous vari-peopled crowd
in historic Fleet street and around
ancient law courts many hours be
fore the trial was scheduled to com
mence
Not since Pamell, Irish party lead
er in Parliament, successfully defied
the London Times, in 1887, to prove
charges of traitorous, conduct against
him and thus put the party and a
great section of the Irish people on
trial, has such British public inter
est been lent to a law proceeding in
volving Ireland Parnell's trial
stretched from February to October.
Casement's trial is expected to be fin
ished in at least three weeks.
Sentence Commuted.
A second trial for high treason in
lecent years, that of Colonel Arthur
Lynch, a member of Parliament, was
only a little less noteworthy. Lynch
was found guilty in 1903 of partici
pating in the Boer war on the side
of the Boers He was condemned to
death, but his sentence was commu
ted to life imprisonment.

Inning.
It was a case of "too much Booth"
in the baseball game Sunday after
noon at the new athletic park be
tween Bemidji and Grand Rapids, the
latter team winning by a score of
6 to 5
Reinforced by two star players, D.
Booth and Booth of the famous
Hibbing nine, recognized as the fast
est in the state outside of the Amer
ican association teams, Grand Rapids
was victorious in one of the most
thrilling battles ever seen on a Be
midji diamond
Carroll Worst Offender.
Carroll Booth, the stocky little
third baseman, was the worst offend
er, cutting off hits and runs by his
brilliant fielding and it was this gen
tleman who marched up to the plate
in the first halt of the ninth, with
the score a tie and after having two
strikes, hoisted the ball over the cen
ter field fence for a home run. It
was "some" hit Booth was in
the box for Grand Rapids, allowing
six hits.
Was Anybody's Game.
It was anybody's game up to the
ninth inning. Bemidji fought an up
hill game and by timely hitting and
good baserunning tied the game in
the eighth.
Grand Rapids was shut out in the
first inning, the first three men going
out Bemidji scored in its half on
an error, a base on balls and a hit
In the second inning D. Booth got
a short hit over short, E. Farrell was
safe on an error and Erskine reached
first on an error, the bases being fill
ed with no one out. D. Booth was
forced out at home by Benton and
Farell scored on a wild pitch. Kan
nerberg then tightened up and struck
out the next two men.
Two Scores in Third.
In the third inning Grand Rapids
secured two more scores on two hits
and an error. The Rapids team also
counted two more in the fourth on
three hits.
Bemidji counted twice in the fifth
on two hits, a base on balls and a
sacrifice. Neither side scored in the
sixth or seventh.
In the eighth inning Bemidji tied
the score on a hit, an error and a
passed ball. With the score a tie
the Bemidji fans were rooting for a
victory, but Mr. Booth of Hibbing
sounded the death knell by politely
lifting one over the fence. The Be
midji team was retired one-two-three
the ninth inning.
The largest crowd of the season
attended the game. All the stands
were crowded.

St. Paul, June 26.(By United

the border." This was the or
der received today from the
Central department by General
Wood. This may mean the im
mediate departure of the Min

that some members of the Min

St Paul, Minn June 26 Minne
sota's national guard was almost com
pletely mobilized at Fort Snelling to
day
If Washington authorities should
order them to the Mexican frontier
at once, they would probably be able
to entrain in two weeks.
If they are not ordered to Mexico
at once, it may take three weeks to
get the troops "reasonably prepared/'
Take Two Weeks.
This was the situation today when
the guard went into the second week
of its preparedness for Mexican duty.
Major General Wright today stated
that it would take two weeks before
a general exodus of the Minnesota
troops. The second battalion of the
First regiment, however, will be
ready to go within a few days.
Governor Burnquist reviewed the
troops here yesterday. Large crowds
of people witnessed the parade.
Minnesota Low.
Realizing that Minnesota's condi
tion of preparedness is lower than
that of almost every other state, the
national guard today jumped into the
game of getting ready.
Tents had been erected for the sol
diers several days ago. Kitchens had
been erected and showers baths in
tents were ready for use. Plumbing
to increase sanitation, emptying into
the intersection of the Minnesota and
Mississippi rivers into which the
fort's grounds jut, had been built.
Hardening Drills.
Today's work consisted of harden
ing drills and getting the soldier
boys on speaking terms with their
rifles. Long hikes will probably not
be started before tomorrow, which
is the date for St. Paul's civic patri
otism day. By Mayor Irvin's proc
lamation tomorrow was set aside for
flag waving and patriotic demonstra
tions.
Organization of a reserve militia to
attend to internal state affairs while
the regular state militia is in Federal
service, as decided upon Saturday,
was the subject of another confer
ence today between Governor Burn
quist, Maj. Gen. Wood and Brig. Gen.
Wright into whose care the regulars
passed today. Means of appealing to
patriotism of those that can't go to
the front, were completed today. This
process, it is said, will consist of get
ting these patriots to contribute
money to a fund to keep the families
of guardsmen ordered to the border.
What is called enthusiasm is in
large part extraordinary capacity for

Washington, June 26.The Un ited States has sent an ultimatum to
Mexico.
Carranza's reply to President W ilson's note was made public yes-
terday It says, referring to the Carrizal incident, that through
General Trevino, the United States troops were warned not to
move to the south, east or west from points now located and that his
troops were instructed to prevent the U. S. troops from making excur-
sions into Mexican territory.
Several Men Killed.
Trevino, says the note, told General Pershing and he acknowledged
receipt on May 21. The note further says that notwithstanding orders,
the S. troops wsre discovered near Carrizal and an engagement fol-
lowed. Several men on both sides were killed and the wounded Amer-
ican soldiers were taken prisoners.
The United States in its ultimatum^
to Mexico states that the government
of the United States can place no
other construction upon the Mexican
communication that it is intended
as a formal avowal of a deliberately
hostile act against the forces of the
S now in Mexico, and the an
nouncement of the purpose to attack
S men without provocation when
ever they move from the present po
sitions in pursuance of the object for
which they were sent to Mexico, not
withstanding that these acts do not
involve unfriendly intent but to pro
tect the S from bandit raids.
Demand Statement.
Therefore, says the ultimatum, the
S demands the immediate release
of prisoners taken in the encounter
at Carrizal, with any property of the
U. S taken with them, and the gov
ernment of the U. S. expects an early
statement from your government re
garding its course of action. This
statement must be made through
usual channels and not through sub-,
ordinate military commanders.
Congressional leaders today were
prepared to receive a message from
President Wilson. Chairman TTloocl
of the house foreign affairs commit
tee told his colleagues today that war
seems a certainty.
Senator Stone was in an hour's
conference with the president today.
He then admitted that the situation
was exceedingly acute and would
make no denial that war was virtu

General Funston yesterday re
ceived from General Pershing a let
ter that Captain Morey of the am
bushed Tenth cavalry wrote while
lyin& wounded in a hole after the
Carrizal affair. The letter recites
that during a parley Mexican sol
diers came out of Carrizal. The Am
ericans fearing that they would be

Captain Morey had been without
food and water for several hours

tions were not accepted.
Volunteer Company.
Several former members of the na
tional guard and regularly army in
Bemidji are making preparations for
the organization of a volunteer com
pany in case there is a call for volun

It was pointed out today that per

Several members of the Bemidji band
today stated that if a call is issued
they would enlist.
Preparations are also being made
in Bemidji for a parade and demon
stration in case the Bemidji militia
is called. That Bemidji will give its
fighting men a "royal" departure is
almost certain.
