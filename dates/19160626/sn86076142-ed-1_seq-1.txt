Roosevelt Supports Hughes
And Declines Nomination
Firmly Opposed to Third Ticket, as he Believes Hughes
is the One Man Best Qualified to Serve the Country
in a Great Crisis, and Protect it From Perils Invited
By the Timidity of President Wilson.
(Br Awwelated Prtaak
CHICAGO, June 26. The Progres
sive executive committee this morn
ing received the answer of Theodore
Roosevelt, in which he formally de
clined (lie nomination on the Pi ogres
lite ticket and strongly urged thut
organization to support C. E. Hughes.
The letter in part Is as follows:
"Since the adjournment of the con
vention I have received between two
.n! three thousand letters and tele
gram from men who had supported
me for the nomination, the majority
expressing the desire that I would
refuse to run, while a minority urged
that I should accept the nomination.
Ai ft is a physically impossibility to
answer these letters and telegrams
Individually I beg the courtesy of the
tenders that they will accept this
public statement In lieu of such
anxwers.
Two Yean' Ordeal
"The results or the terrible world
war of the past two years have now
made it evident to all who are willing
to see that In this country there must
be spiritual and Industrial prepared
ness, along the lines of efficiency, of
loyal service to the nation, and of
practical application of the precept
that each man must be his brother's
keeper. Furthermore, It is no less
evident that this preparedness for
the tasks of peace forma the only
sound basis lor thut indispenslble
military preparedness which rests on
umvral military training and which

tory service In time of war. Such
uiilveml obligatory training and
service are the necessary compli

Two miners employed at the White
Caps were killed early Saturday
evening in a manner rarely experi
enced. The victims were John Casas

his partner, Larry Slatovlch, was so
seriously Injured that he died a few
hours later. Casassas was blown to
pieces and the other man was so
hadly bruised that nothing could be
done except to alleviate his sufferings
until death came to his relief.
The cause of the accident Is un
known, but It Is believed to nave
occurred through the failure of a
tick of powder to ignite when the
test of the charge In one of the
holes went off. Tbe men counted
the shots and satisfied themselves
that none had missed fire, so no

as things actually are the Progressive
national organization no longer offers
the means whereby we can make
these convictions effective In our
national life. Under such circum
stances our duty Is to do the best
we can, and not to sulk because our
leadership is rejected. Thut we our
selves continue to believe that the
course we advocated was In the
highest Interest of the American
I eople la aaide from the question. It
is unpatriotic to refuse to do the
best poBBible merely because the
people have not put us in position
to do what we regard as the very
best. It remains for us, good humor

the situation and endeavor to get
out of It the best that it can be
made to yield from the standpoint of
the interests of the nation as a
whole. ...... i
"This was the situation at the open

curred the presidential election
would result in the choice of either!
the Republican or the Democratic
nominee. The present administration,
during its three years of life, has
l.een guilty of shortcomings more
signal than those of any administra
tion since the days of Buchanan.
I'rnm the standpoint of national
honor and Interest it stood on an
even lower level than the adminis

BISHOP HUNTING ANNOUNCES
APPOINTMENT TO VESTRY
OF ST. MARKS
in compliance with the request of
Ut. Rev. G. S. Hunting, Episcopal
Bishop of Nevada, the vestry of St.
Marks church met at the rectory on
Saturday evening. Tbe bishop ex
plained the object of the meeting
was to discuss arrangements that
had been made relative to securing
the services of a regular clergyman
for the parish. He stated he had
engaged the Rev. Harlan Bailey of
Olympia, Wash., as the permanent
minister, and that he would assume
charge of his duties on July 16.
However, he will alternate between
Tonopah and Qoldfteld until Sep
tember 1, at which time a clergyman
will be appointed for St. John's
church at the latter point. It is
most probable the Rev. P. S. Smiths,
who has been visiting Tonopah once
a month for some time past, will
accompany Rev. Bailey so that he
may more quickly become acquainted
with the members and friends of the
church. The bishop preached both
morning and evening, and took occa
sion to urgently request St. Marks'
extend to their new clergyman that
amount of encouragement and loyal
support to which he Is entitled, and
thereby enable him to accomplish all
the good within his power for the
parish and the community at large.
The bishop selected a portion of
the third chapter of Genesis, dealing
with the story of the' first sin, as his
morning's discourse.
Bishop Hunting left today on a

clerical duties.

conflicting forces were at work. There
were men among the organization
loaders who advocated a course of
action such as offered no improve
nient upon the Democratic position
and advocated the nomination of can
didates whose election would have
represented no Improvement upon the
continuance In office of Mr. Wilson.
If such a course were followed it
would obviously become our duty to
run a third ticket. But it was plainly
our duty to do everything honorable
In order to prevent such a necessity;
to do everything short of sacrificing
our most sacred convictions in order
to secure the alignment under one
leadership of the forces opposed to
the continuance In power of Mr.
Wilson and the Democratic party.
One Standard Bearer
"Under these circumstances the
Progressive .National committee, at
Chicago, in January, outlined our
duty to Beek common action with
the Republican party, using the fol
lowing words: "Our people are seek
ing leadership leadership ' of the
highest order and most courageous
character; leadership that will draft
to itself for the country's benefit the
unselfish and patriotic services of Its
ablest citizens. The surest way to
secure for our country the required
leadership will be by having, If pos
sible, both tbe Progressive and Re
publican parties choose the same
standard bearer.
