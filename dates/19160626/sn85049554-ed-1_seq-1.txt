Mexicans Being Moved to Proximity of
Main Railroad.
El Paso, Tex., June 26.—Carranza
troops in northern Chihuahua are be
ing concentrated at once and in force
along the line of the Mexican central
railroad between Juarez and Chihua
hua City, say private messages reach
ing here today. These fhessages said
that each troop train, packed with men
to be distributed at points between
VlUa Ahumada and Laguna, .le®t tho
state capital last night. While tho
troops are being aligned along the
railroad: other reports say that Gen
eral Pershing's command rests less
than fifty miles west, drawing a par
allel line up the Santa Maria valley
from (El Valle to Columbus, N. M.
Large Mexican forces are being gath
ered at Villa Ahumada and at Monte
zuma while, according to reports here.
General Pershing has his largest forces
at B1 Valle and Colonia Dublan.
Between the two lines, which are
about
2GO miles long, both American
and Mexican cavalry scouting patrols
are operating.
'With reports "that thousands of per
sons In northern Mexico are on the
verge of starvation and that the eco
nomic situation is more acute, fears
were expressed that some of the na
tives might attack the American motor
supply trains in the hope of setting
food. A refugee from iMexlco City ar
riving at the border today said that
at stations in north Durango men and
women, who no longer had clothing,
crowded about the train and cried for
food. He said they fought as beasts
over bits of orange peeling which a
fellow traveler' threw frdm the coach.
Mexican Press Bloodthirsty.
The refugees brought to the border
papers to show to what extent the
anti-American feeling is growing. An
editorial in !La Reform
a, a semi-offi
cial paper published in SaltLllo, cap
tioned "Blood," makes a violent, attack
on the United States, the people and
policies and continues:
"Above all do not forget that at a
time of natiotiftl need, humanity is a
-crime and frightfulness Is a virtue,
"Pull out eyes, snatch out. hearts,
tear open dresses, drink, if you can,
the blood in the skull of the invaders
from the cities of Tankeeland.

Information reaching here tiyjay from
apparently reliable sources stated that
Villa until recently at Santa Rosalia,
had reached an agreement with the de
facto government and that this was be
ing used ^o induce his followers to Join
the Carranza forces.
Seven Americans attached to the Al
varado~ Mining and ifilllhg Company
are expected to reach Juarez late today
from Chihuahua, leaving practically no

PERSHING READY FOR ACTION.
Has 12,000 Fighting Men In Pink of
Condition and Well Situated.
El Paso, June 26.—Gep. John J. Per
shing's erstwhile punitive expeditionary
force in Mexico is reacy tor action, if
action is needed.
Today, according to the information
here, his southernmost outpost is in the
vicinity of El Valle, less than fifty miles
from Colonia Dublan, the main base.
It is believed that from El Paso, a large
and mobile force may be pointed in
wards in a strategic position towards
the Mexico Central railroad.
In the neighborhood of 12,000 men, in
splendid fighting trim, compose Gen
eral Pershing's army.
Equipment has been .put in the beBt
of condition. Horses and mules,have
beep tested until.only the fit and strong
remain. Big motor trains already load
ed with supplies for an advance are
lined up rearfy to get started.
In the meantime .every empty truck
which remained at Columbus has been
sent to the front to aid in the speedy
transportation of infantry.
Tension Rising.
Speculation on the border dealt with
the possibility that some action by the
Mexicans may precipitate hostilities be
fore the exchanges between Washing
ton and Mexico City are concluded.
With the lines of the Americans and
^Mexicans paralleling for at least- 150
miles, the rash action of some subordi
nate commanders, it is considered here,
might at any time embroil the main
command. Tension consequently rose
with each hour.
Pear that events might be thus has
tened prompted border commanders to
redouble their vigilance. At all points
the men were ready to spring into ac
tion. Troops- dispositions were madia
with a view to meeting sudden and un
expected emergencies.
Up t4 Carranza.
Fifty thousand national guardsmen
are expeditiously coming to El Paso, It
was said today, and many of them may
get there by the end of the week. From
Columbus it was said that preparation
is being made to take care of 10,000
guardsmen.
Andres Garcia, the Mexican consul
at El Paso, today declared himself still
optimistic that hostilities would be
averted.
"I do not see that there need be war
from my Interpretation of President
Wilson's last note," he said. "These
seventeen prisoners ought not to offer
ail obstacle. We have received no in
formation from, the" de facto authorities
as to the-questions on hand and the
matter la upjto General Carranza."

Orders Mexieans to Resist If Pershing
Moves Southward.
Chihuahua City, Mex., June 26.—On
the heels of the American evacuation
-of San Geronimo and Bachinafik, Gen
eral Trevino has occupied the points
with his troops, issuing orders that
any attempt of General Pershing's men
to come back south must be prevented.
British Vice Consul O'Shea has fa
cilitated the removal fit Americans at
Torreon and Durango, providing them
with a box car with Instructions that
its progress be expedited.
Five of the six negroes piade prison
ers at Carrizal and now here are named
John Wilson, George M. Chaplin, T.
Hopkins, Thomas Garfield and W. D.
Gibson.
The prisoners here tell of two white
packets only known to them as "Texas"
and "Slim," who were with Captain
Boyd's force and who they think, es
caped.
Gibson, speaking for his comrades,
said that they were taken at Los
Humps, many miles from the base of
the iflght by pursuing cavalry. He
aaid the six of them were "trying to
beat it for El Paso."
General Trevino said that Gibson
told him that the expedition were
lined up by Captain Boyd two miles
out of Carrizal, and told that "they
might get thru peacefully or they
might be up against it but that in
any event there was but one thing to
do and that was to obey orders."
CASEMENT PLACED
ON TRIAL IN LONDON
Leader of Irish Revolt Pleads Not
Guilty to Indictment—^Jury Speedily
Procured After Seme Challenges by

London, June 23.—At 10^:30 this
morning a clerk in t& court of the
Lord Chief Justice called out "The
king versus Sir Roger C&sement," and
the trial of the knight who is ac
cused of having instigated the Irish
rebellion was under way.
Viscount Reading, the lord chief
justice, and Justices Avory and Hor
ridge, in bright scarlet robes and'
powdered wigs, took their seats, the
case wa called and Sir Roger Case
ment was brought In to answer to the
charge of high treason.
The ihdlctment followed in legal
points that returned against Col.
Arthur Lynoh, who fought against
the British In the Boer war. When
asked, if he was guilty, Sir Roger
bowed and murmured something which
was Inaudible, His counsel, Alexander
Sullivan, of J&ublin, arose quickly and
argued *that the indictment was "no
offense known* to the law" and that
none of the acts specified were al
leged to have taken place in. any ter
ritory over which the king has control.
After .consultation the court ruled that
any exceptions to the Indictment in a
case of such importance could be taken
after the hearing without prejudice to
the prisoner.
Then Sir Roger made a formal plea
of not guilty, speaking In Arm-tone*.
Jurors from the panel, were Milled for

regiment by Wednesday. The Second
and Thlrsf regiments will follow.
"Medical officers are examining the
men at an average of one man a min
ute,' he said. "We have a dozen offi
cers working and I see no reason why
the First regiment should not entrain
for the border at once."
He said that he had not been advised
by the war department where tho
troops would go, but said he thought
El Paso would be the place.
Refuse to Take Oaath.
More than a, score of men In the
Fir^t regiment today refused to take
the oath and were mustered out of
service. Company L, of Keokuk, be
cause their captain was changed and
a new one substituted, refused to go
and was ordered returned to its home
station. Later, however, General Mor

enlist in other companies if they de
sired.
Shortly after noon today troop trains
bearing members of the Second infan
try arrived at the camp. The entire
regiment, it was thought, will be under
canvas before night.
On account of the intense heat and
stiff .drills to which the men were not
accustomed, there were several minor
heat prostrations today.
The camp schedule instituted by
Brig.-Gen. Hubert A. Allen calls for
seven hours drill daily. This will be
kept up until the men leave for the

ORI*ET DEFENSE
OUTLINED IN COURT
Attorney For University Student Gives
Outline of Evidence to Be Intro
duc«d^ to Refute State's Testi
mony.
.Waukeg^n, 111., June 2$. That
Maiian^Lambert was suffering from
hallucinations for some, time before
tjie day sh'cjgteftifrom cyanide,
of potas
siumvunder the^oaks near Laice Forest,
that she had ready access to the
poison in her high school laboratory
and that the powder found on h^r
hand did not necessarily come from a
solution of the deadly stuff were
salient points in the opening state
ment for the defense of Will Orpet,
made here today by James H. Wilker
son, 'senior counsel of the University
of Wisconsin student.
iMr. Wilkerson described the girl as
less the happy irresponsible child
depicted by the prosecution than the
budding woman. He pointed out that
she was nearer 18, the age fixed by the
law as a maturity for women, than
was Orpet to 21, the age at which
young men are presumed capable of
assuming responsibility for their acts.
He said evidence would be produced
to prove that his client could not have
had murder in his mind when he met
his school girl sweetheart. The ad
dress, in part, follows:
"The indictment'is for murder. The
prosecution charges that the defend
ant wilfully administered poison to
Marian Lambert. The theory of
guilt outlined by the prosecution
necessarily involves the accusation
that for several weeks before the
death of Marian Lambert the defend
ant had been plotting her murder and
that he proceeded carefully and cun
ningly to carry qut his plot.
"The evidence relied upon Is circum
stantial. No witness 'has been pro
duced who saw the defendant give the
poison to Marian Lambert. No wit
ness is produced who saw the defend
ant with poison In his possession prior
to the death of Marian Lambert. There
Is no witness who testifies that the
defendant obtained from any source
any poison prior to the death of
Marian Lambert.
"In outlining the evidence upon
which the defendant relies, it becomcs
necessary to state that evidence in its
relation to the set of circumstances
upon which the prosecution has stated
it relies. Many of the facts upon which
the defense places reliance have al
ready been' partially brought out by
the prosecution and in the presentation
of some of the evidence for the de
fense we will therefore find that we
are explaining matters to which there
has already been reference.
"It will be helpful to group the cir
cumstances relied upon by the prose
cution in the order in which they were
presented in the opening statement for
the state. They are
"(1) The physical characteristics of
the place where the body of Marian
Lambert was found. (2) The mental
condition of Marian Lambert. (3) The
acts of Marian Lambert for a few
days prior to her death. (4) The con
dition of the body and clothing of
Marian Lambert when her body was
found. C5) The properties of cyanide
of potassium the poison which caused
the death oif Marian Lambert. (6) The
relations between the defendant and
Marian Lambert Including their cor
respondence. (7) The cyanide in the
greenhouse at the place managed by
the defendant's father. (8) The cyanide
of potassium at the laboratory of the
Deerfleld high school which was at
tended by Marian Lambert. (9) The
illness of MtU'lan Lambert on Jan. 14,
ISM!.- (10) The relations between the
defendant and Celestia Yonker. (11)
The acts oif the defendant shortly prior
to (Feb- 9. 1918. (12) The acts of the

ROOSEVELT IS

PARTY DIVIDED ON
ACTION TO TAKE
Leaders Favor Following Lead of Col
onel, But Many Third Party Commit
teemen Say They Will Not Vote For
Hughes—To Seek Opinion of State
Organization Workers Parker For
Progressive Tioket.
Chicago, June 26.—Theodore Roose
velt, in a letter to the progressive na
tional committee here today, finally de
clined to accept the nomination of the
party and urged the Bull Moosers to
support Charles E. Hughes.
The colonel's letter was read_by Os
car King Davis, secretary of the com
mittee. The meeting was called to
order by Matthew Hale, of Massachu
setts, vice chairman, in the absence of
Chairman Victor-burdock, of Kansas.
The message from Colonel Roosevelt
was given close attention.
Questions coming up for the com
mittee's action were these: Shall a
third party be put in the field? Shall
Hughes be substituted for Roosevelt on
the progressive ticket or shall he be en
dorsed? Shall the committee refuse to
endorse any candidate? Shall the party
organizattons be continued?
Among those who favored the en
dorsement of Hughes were George W.
Perkins, of New York and William
Flinn, of Pennsylvania. Opposed to
this wef^jJohn (M.^Parker, of Louisiana,
vice presidential candidate of the pro
gressive party Matthew Hale, and
others.
State committee organizers may be
called on to find out the attitude of the
progressive party as to the candidacy
of Charles E. Hughes, the Republican
nominee for president..
This was indicated prior to the meet
ing of the progressive national commit
tee here today.
That the leaders were divided as to
the proper course to pursue was evi
dent In the statements and in the-con
ferehce held.
SOUTH AMERICAN VIEW.
Brazilian Paper Says United State*
Should Maintain Peace.
Buenos Aires, Brazil, June 26.—Dis
cussing the Mexican situation La Pren
za today says that the United-States
as a sovereign nation has the right to
defend its Interests trod upon by the
Mexican revolution. It would commit
an error, however, by declaring war, the
paper believes, "as the triumph of the
Pan-American policy is preferable to
the satisfaction that would result by a
war to exact reparation for an offense
that the Mexican people can not make
good because of the anarchy which ex
presses the will that only the voice of
the constituted powers could express.
Upon the United States alone devolves
the duty of avoiding war, as Mexico
can not recognize the obligation be
cause of its state of anarchy.
"The United 'States must show Im
partiality, repress armed Incursions,
prevent the exportation of arms and
leave the Mexican factions to fight it
ou among themselves co a solution."
Offers ef Mediation,
Washington, June 2$.—iSix Central
and South American republics thru
their representatives here today, In
quired informally of Eliseo ATredon
do, the General Carranza ambassador
designate, whether his government
would accept offers of mediation In the
crisis between Mexico and tho United
States.
South and Central American repub
lics will not offer mediation between
the'United States" In the Mexican
crisis at this time. This was given out
today by'Minister Calderon, of Bolivia,
after a conference with Secretary
Lansing.
Minister Calderon said he had been
told by the secretary that the United
States considered this was not the time
for mediation. The minister added
that the Latin-American countries
might consider the subject again after
the United States had received a reply
from,/the Carranza government to the
note sent by Secretary Lansing.
Spain Would Welcome Intervention.
Paris, June 26.—The Madrid corre
spondent of the Temps sends the fol
lowing:
"Public opinion here Is greatly Im
pressed by the Mexican situation. De
spite the talk of lnterventidn by King
Alfonso for peace between the United
States and Mexico, no official move
in this respect has been made so far.
The feeling in Spain Is that it Is of the
greatest Importance and urgently
needed that order be re-established lu
Mexico.
"Intervention by the United States,
It is said, would not be regarded un
favorably by Spain, because early In
the Mexican revolution Spanish fugi
tives were effectively aided by the
United States, the Spanish government
ituelf being unable to act directly."
