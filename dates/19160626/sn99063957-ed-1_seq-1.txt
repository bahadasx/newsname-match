Casement was sarcely the same man
wno appeared at the preliminary ar
raignnient in liow Street police court.
Then, his beard sadlv needed trim
ming, his hair was frowsy and he wore
an ill-fitting sack suit. When he was
brought over this morning from Brix
ton prison, to which he had been re
moved from the Tower of London, h
wore u careruny urusneil morning coat
and immnculuto linen. His beard and
hair were carefully trimmed
The prisoner smiled and nodded to
several acquaintances as he entered.
He listened calmlv while the clerk read
the lengthy charge reciting his activi
ties in connection with the Ijish re
bellion and his attempts to induce
Irish prisoners in Germany to desert
from the British army. He displayed
keen interest in the preliminary pro
ceedings, watching his counsel, Mich
ael Boyle "of Philadelphia closely.
Daniel Bailey, an Irish soldier ar
raigned with Casement at the prelim
inary hearing, will be tried separately.
It is believed he will receive leuient
treatmnt because of the evidence he
furnished the crown.
Attorney General Smith made an ex
haustive opening statement, reciting
Casement's li yenrs in the consular
and other services, his thorough famil
iarity with government methods and
consequently his great personal respon-
siinimes. casement listened, nnonr-
enly bored. He yawned several times
while Smith was talking.
John Tilley, chief clerk at the for
eign office, was the first witness. He
identified a HtBteimnt of Sir Roger's
political record as taken from the files
of the foreign office.
Private John Cronin of Cork, who
was captured by the Germans and im
prisoned at Limburg, testified about
Sir- Rogers efforts to organize an Irish
brigade among the Irish' prisoners to
be landed in Ireland to fight for Irish
independence.
On cross-examination Solicitor Sulli
van gave the first inkling of what the
defense may be. lie attempted to
draw the admission from Cronin that
Casement was enrolling a brigade to
fight against the Ulster volunteers,
landing in Ireland after the war.
Cronin admitted he did not hear
Casement say specifically that the
Trish brigade was to fight England.
Corporal John Robinson and Private
William Kgan gave, similar testimony.

A Call For 250,000 Volun

War Is Begun
By Carl D. Groat
(failed Press staff correspondent)
Washington, June 20. A double re
sponsibility for the Carrizal battle ap
peared partly published today. Jt did
not, however, place such a burden on
the American forces as to assure
peace. On the contrary, developments
so snuf -a uiemseives mat it seems
likely President Wilson may find it
necessary to appear before conaress
oeiore tne weeks end,
A complete right about face by Car-
ranza can save the situation. The re
port oi Captain Morey, as ho lav sup
posedly dying on the Carrizal desert,
indicated to officials that the action
of the American force before Carrizal
might have been provocative.
Morey wrote that Captain Boyd un
der the impression that the Mexicans
would run when the Americans fired.
" We formed for attack," said Mor
ev's report.
Carrauza to Blame
On the other hand, the publication
of the American demands for the re
lease of 17 American prisoners from
Chihuahua showed that Carranea had
issued the order to General Trevino
not to permit the Americans to move
south, east or west. .
This' would place upon Cnrranza the
responsibility k'or tii Mexicans fir
ing and perhaps prove necessity for
Boyd's offensive.
Persons in touch with President Wil
son's views said he would delay going
before congress on a war mission until
Carrauza had had time to answer the
American ultimatum.
The charge in this message th.1t Car
ranza had acted with hostility in issu
ing the order to General Trevino gave
evidence that the administration be
lieves war the only answer if Carrauza
do not free the. Americana taken at
Carrizal, disavow that incident and
promise safety to the American forces
hereafter.
Troop trains are ready to tako
American militiamen to the border. I
Militia Going This Week
The bulk of the 100,000 militiamen'
ordered out will probably be either on
the line or en route before tne end o.
the. week. Everything possible is be
ing done to hasten the department of
the entire force.
These preparations, coupled with
war department activity, reflected the
view of armv men that trouble is In
; the ol'l'ini!, thoueh they admitted di:
lotnacy may still have a chance.
The campaign contemplates taking
sufficient, time to avoid unnecessary
casualties through lack of preparation.
