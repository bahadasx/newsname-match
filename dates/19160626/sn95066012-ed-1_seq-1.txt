Commander of K Troop Describes
Fight at Carrizal
BADLY WOUNDED BUT SAFE
Believing His Condition Hopeless Or
dered Troopers to Leave Him to
Die in Desert.
San Antonio, Tex., Juno 2C Mexi
can troops fired the first shot on the
troopers of the l'Hh United States cav
alry at Carrizal, but not until the
American force, fearing an ambush,
had advanced in battle formation, ac
cording to a letter written on the day
of the fight by ('apt Lewis Morey, com
manding K troop of tho 10th cavalry
forwarded to Gen. Funston by Gen.
Pershing last night.
('apt. Morey himself is safe, having
reached the main body of American
troops with two of his men. Gen. Fun
ston received a message by telephone
last night from Mrs. Morey at Austin,
Tex., that she had had a w ireless mes
sage from him from "somewhere in
Mexico" to tho effect.
('apt. Morey wrote the letter at 9.15
a. m., the 21st, while hiding in a hole
about 2000 yards from the scene of the
battle, ('apt. Morey was wounded and
had another wounded man and three
unwounded troopers with him. The
three unwounded men were picked up
by a detachment under Lieut. Henry
A. Meyers, Jr., of the 10th cavalry, and
the letter brought to Gen. Pershing yes
terday.
("apt. Morey was left to die on the
ileyert from thirst and his wounds.
The men abandoned hint at his own
order. Tho three unwounded men had
carried him, according to their
stories to Lieut Meyer, from the hole
wiu-re he had hidden and made their
way nearly two miles from the battle
field. They were forced to stop and
('apt. Morey, believing himself hope
lessly wounded, oi dered them to leave
him. They also thought him about to
die from loss of blood and thirst, and
obeyed.
The stories of the rescued men to
Lieut. Meyer were vague about the de
tails of tho fight, according to Gen.
Pershing's report to Gen. Funston.
('apt. Morey's letter told of the join-
Ins of the troop (', under Capt. Charles
T. Boyd, and troop K, under his own
command, at Ojo Santo Domingo on
the 20th and the advance together
toward Carrizal at C.I'O In the morn
ng. There they halted and Capt. Boyd
sent a courier into Carrizal asking
permission of Gen. Felix Gomez to en
ter the town, saying he was going to
Villa Ahumada. Gomez replied that
he would not be allowed to enter tho
town, but might make a detour
around it.
Fearing that they were about to be
trapped by the Mexicans, who had
moved out from the town during tho
parley, the American troops deployed
in battle formation, mounted and
moved forward. Tho Mexicans then
opened fire. Capt. Boyd ordered his
men to dismount, and returned tin:
fire, the engagement lasting an hour
Both C and K troops advanced, the
former to the position occupied by a
Mexican machlno gun and the latter
closing In to one side. Troop K also
was attacked from the flank, while
a detachment of Mexicans from the
town reached the rear of the American
line and stampeded tho led horses
The Mexicans succeeded in checking
the American advance, and the
Americans first were forced to fall
back and finally to scatter, each for
himself.

A Query or Two.
In connection with the senatorial
question which is just now engaging
the attention of some of the papers In
Vermont, and on the supposition that
Carroll S. Page desires to succeed him
self, it would seem natural enough to
ask why the Senator has not as yet
taken the people of Vermont Into his
confidence on the subject of the sue
cesflon and made a frank statement o
the grounds on which he desires, an
hopes for, a re election.
Constructive legislation is n live
topic these dayg. and Is being brought
to the lront in many of the state i
Pits; and under these circumstances.
as bearing directly upon the senatorial
succession, it seems natural enough to
ask Senator Page a question or two.
For Instance:
What constructive measure, if any,
has he proposed, stood behind, and
been able to push to a successful issue
in tho senate during his eight years
service in that honorable body?
Did ho really vote against tho rural
credit bill, and the bill looking to the
irotectlon cf tho sources of water-
power In these Putted States? And if
so, will he tell his constituency why?
The Senator introduced a long time
ago a vocational educational bill that
had merit, and which Vornwnters. in
common with the people of other
states, hoped to see become a law.
Nothing of a definite nature has been
neara from that measure for some
time. What has happened to it?
We believe that a candidate for any
high position has nothing to lone, und
everything to gain, by taking the pub
tic Into his eonlldenee; and that a close
relation and flunk understanding be
tween the two will Inure to the beiiellt
of both. Vermont Tribune.

DESTINATION IS NOT KNOWN
Vermont Regiment Honored by Being
In the First Division of Militia
Ready for Service.
Fort Ethan Allen, June 26. Tho
Vermont regiment has been ordered to
the front and will entrain tonight at
unset. Its route and destination are
not known as yet.
The Vermont regiment is one of tho
ery first in the wholo United States
eady and is honored by being called in
the fust division. The militia of Kan
sas, California and Missouri were or
dered out regardless of their state of
preparation because they were near
the border. The next call was for the
regiments ready for service and in-
ludes tho 7th, 71st, 14th and 12th of
New York, four regiments from Massa-
husetts, two regiments from Connectl
ut, one regiment trom New Jersey and
one from Vermont. One or more
squadrons of cavalry and artillery and
ambulance corps aro going with the
same troops.
Camp Gates, June 2.". A few minut
es before midnight Col. Ira L. Reeves,
commanding the 1st Vermont infantry
md 1st squadron of cavalry, received
orders from the department of the east
to entrain the regiment tomorrow for
service on the Mexican border. Col.
Ileeves cannot state tonight the desti
nation of the command. Work was be
gun immediately to strike camp and
trains will be in readiness for the men
to move by sunset tomorrow.
Camp Gates, Colchester, June 25.
The 1.100 men who yesterday con
stituted tho national guard of Vermont
are tonight in tho federal service and
await final equipment before being
rushed to the Mexican border in re
sponse to an urgent call from the war
department to move the troops at the
earliest possible moment. Utck of
shoes and socks Is all that prevents
the men being started tonight.
The oath of allegiance was subscrib
ed to by 90 per cent of the Vermont
guardrmcn today and tonight the
strength of the regiment is 50 officers
and upwards of lluO privatees, includ
ing the 1st squadron of cavalry. If
orders are received to waive physical
examination, as Is being done in other
states, it is likely that the number of
men ready for the front when the rcgi
nient starts will be nearly up to a war
strength.
Aside from the matter of shoes and
socks the men are outfitted for field
sorvlco and In readiness to go aboard
trains at once. Adjt. Gen. Tillotson
said tonight that lie could not say
when the necessary supplies would be
received but expected that they might
arrive on any train. Ho said that it
would he tho height of folly to send
the men to the border insufficiently
provided with footwear yet orders
might come for the men to move as
they stand.
The oath was administered to the
officers first by Adjt. Gen. Tillotson,
who is a notary public, and was then
given to the enlisted men. Ninety per
cent or tno guardsmen took the oath
and those who did not will be dls
charged at once. The oath which
makes the Vermont guardsmen a part
f the army of the United States Is as
follows:
"I do hereby acknowledge to
have voluntarily enlisted this day
as a soldier in the national guard
of the United States and of the
state of Vermont for a period of
three years in service and three
years Jn reserve under tho condi
tion prescribed by law unless
Rooner discharged by proper auth
ority. "And I do hereby solemnly
swear that 1 will bear true faith
and allegiance to tho I'nlted
States of America and to the
state of Vermont and that I will
servo them honestly und faithful
ly against all their enemies whom
soever and that I will obey orders
of the president of the United
States and of tho governor of tho
state of Vermont and of the oflle
era npixiintrd over me according
to law and tho rules nnd articles

RECRUITING IS SLOW
Young Men Opposed to Being Dis
trlbuted in Different Companies.
Because recruits were not respond
ing rapidly enough to warrant the or
ganization of the proposed machine
company soon enough to take part in
the service on the Mexican border,
Capt. J. B. Ilannon called a citizen's
meeting at the station in the Noveck
block Sunday afternoon for an inform
al discussion of the situation.
From his experience during the two
days that the station had been oien.
Capt. Hannon was disposed to believe
that the young men were not respond
ing readily because they objected to
the plan of distributing the recruits se
cured here among the different com
panics of the gunrd, such as was the
intention when the order was first
made to open the station.
Capt. Hannon was of the opinion
that it had not become generally
known that the machine company was
to bo a Bennington organization. He
believed that the best method to in
crease the interest was to hold a public
meeting at which one of the men con
nected with tho national guard In an
official capacity should ho present nnd
explain the situation. After discussing
details for fully an hour it was decided
to hold a public meeting early this
week. Early this morning, however,
Capt. Hannon learned that the regi
mont had been ordered to the front at
once and plans for the meeting were
abandoned, temporarily at least, or un
til further Instructions were received
from the adjutant general.

B. Trevino not to permit American
forces from Gen. Pershing column to
advance further south, nor to move
ither east or west from the points
where they are located, and to oppose
new incursions of American soldiers in
to Mexican territory. These orders
were brought by Gen. Trevino to the
attention of Gen. Pershing, who ac
knowledged the receipt of the com

I am instructed, therefore, oy my
