WESTERN, IS DEAD
(By United Pi ess)
St. Paul. Minn., Aug 9.A. B.
Stickney, founder of the Chicago.
Great Western rnilway and interested
in other Northwest roads, died this
morning of intestional trouble, tie
was 76 years of age.
Mr. Stickney had been in failing
health for several years. In 1906 it
caused his resignation as receiver and
president of the Great Western. In
1911 he felt forced to resign as a
member of the St. Paul park board
because he was unequal to its ardu
ous duties.
He had failed gradually since that
time. It was less than a week ago,
however, that his condition became
alarming.
Mr. Stickney had lived in St. Paul
since the early sixties, coming here
from his birthplace in Maine. After
teaching school and studying law, he
began his railroad activities in 1869,
when he built the Northern Wiscon
sin railway, now a part of the Omaha
system.
As a promoter of railroads and
founder of the St. Pa,ul Union Stock
yards company, Mr. Stickney was re
garded as one of the most important
contributors to the commercial im
portance of the city.

up a county option street meeting
last nignt.
Rev. J. E. Caldwell of Nymore was
giving an address in favor of the
"dry" cause at the corner of Third
street and Minnesota avenue last eve
ning at eight o'clock and was giving
some forceful points why the "drys"
should win. The male person, seeing
that Rev. Caldwell was making votes
for his cause, attempted to break up
the meeting by throwing a pail of
water on the speaker. Rev. Caldwell

his talk. The action of the "wet"
advocate gained many v~otes for the
"drys."
Another meeting will be held by
the "dry" advocates on the same cor
ner tonight. Several hundred peo
ple attended the meeting last night.
