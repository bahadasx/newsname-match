Saturday afternoon while driving
from Seneca to his home in his Ford
touring car, Homer Ballenger col
lided with a bicycle on which Nor
man Palmer was riding. Young
Palmer was thrown through tho
windshield of the car and was severe
ly cut about tho face and neck and
his frontal bone was fractured. The
accident occurred near the forks of
the Walhalla-Westmlnster road, just
west of the Rino Ridge railway cross
ing. The car was coming from to
ward Seneca and the bicycle from
toward Richland. According to the
evidence, at the time of the collision
the enr was running at a low rate
of speed, having just passed two
buggies, and the bicycle was run
ning pretty fast, lt seems that
young Ballenger was on the right
side of the road, but the bicycler
turned to tho left, realized his mis
take and too lato tried to turn to
the right. The accident happened on
a very sharp curve and neither Pal
mer nor Ballenger saw the other in
time to avert tho accident, although
Ballenger threw on bis emergency
brakes and the car was practically
at a standstill when tho bicycle blt
lt. According to tho Information
available to your correspondent no
blame whatsoever can bo placed upon
the driver of tho car, and this con
clusion ls strengthened by the repu
tation young Ballenger has of being
I one of the safest, most careful driv
ers of the county. In fact, the acci
dent seems to havo been totally un
avoidable.
In the car with young Ballenger
were bis brother John, and Sam Ber
ry, of Greenville, a mall clerk for the
Southern Railway. They immediate
ly plclrod up young Palmer, and with
all possible speed carried him back
to Soneca, where he was immediately
given the best possible medical at
tention. He was carried on to a hos
pital in Greenville and at last ro
ports his chances for recovery wero
good. The sympathy of the entire
community goes out to the family of
the injured young man.

THE LATEST WAH DISPATCHES,
Information from Various Sources
Indicates Entente Successes,
For tho past few days press dis
patches from the European war havo
Indicated almost uniform successes
and advances by the forces of Rus
sia, Franco, Italy and Britain, with
even tho Serbians hero and there
taking active part in the successful
drives and in moro force than ono
would expect to note.
Paris announces that on tho Ver
dun front the terrille battle con
tinues to rage, with advantages in
tho main resting with the French,
though reverses hero and there aro
admitted in consequence of Gorman
counter attacks. In the main, how
ever, the net results are accounted
"satisfactory" to the French.
London announces advances by the
British on tho Somme front, though
severe fighting and wonderful re
sistance by tho Cormnns is reported,
with reverses hero and there for tho
Britons.
Vienna admits the loss of the Cor
illa bridgehead to the Italians, and
tho Italian official war statement
announces that "wo are at the be
ginning of a vast offensive, tho re
sults of which aro certain, though
they may be slow." Upwards of
10,000 Austrian prisoners have been
taken by tho Italians during tho
lighting of tho past three days.
Monto Zebotlno and Monto San
Mlcholo, strongholds of tho Aus
trians, are announced as captured by
tho Italians and solidly and com
pletely in their possession.
Petrograd announces eonlinuod
and almost uniform successes for tho
.Russian forces. The Austro-Gorman
forces are stated to have beon se
verely beaten back on several fronts,
and tho Russian cavalry is said to
he taking active part in pursuing cer
tain units of their foes, who aro in
retreat. Berlin announces tho re
t? remont of certain units in those
sections, which would indicate vir
tual admission of reverses along
these lines. Tho Russians -claim to
havo taken 8,415 men and 16?
officers during tho fighting on Au
gust 6 and 7.
The placing by Germany of von
Hindenburg In supreme command of
operations along the Russian front
would indicate that Berlin considers
the great Russian drive of tho past.
I weeks of more importance than itt
I first was anticipated.
H rossel H Refuse? to Pay.
The city of Brussels has refusod
to pay the Ano of 5,000,000 marks
imposed by the Germans in conse
quence of tho demonstration which
took place at the Belgian capital on
July 21, the national fete day, says
a dispatch from The Hague. A seri
ous crisis is expected.
Acting Burgomaster Lomonnlor,
the dispatch adds, has sent a lotter
to Gen. Von Hissing, the German
Governor of Belgium, flatly declin
ing to pay the line. He Bays it was
imposed on the publio because Of ita
patriotic sentiment and, therefore^
is Illegal and inadmissible.
