EARLY MORNING FIRE
DESTROYSFEEDSTORE
Building Belonging to J. M.
Taylor Burned by Blaze
of Unknown Origin.
LOSS IS ABOUT $7,500
Flames Discovered bv Nigbt
Police at 3 O'Clock
Tins Morning.
Fire, which broke out about 3
o'clock this morning, totally destroyed
the brick building on North Tenth
street occupied by the Columbia Feed
and Grain Company. The building,
which belonged to James M. Taylor
and Berkeley Estes, was valued at $7,
500, while the contents were variously
estimated at from $3,000 to $8,000. The
loss is less than half rovcrcd by in
surance.
The flames were discovered by
night policemen King and Douglas
shortly before 3 o'clock, but were al
ready past control when the fire de
partment arrived a few minutes later.
All that the department could do was
to prevent the flames from spreading
to adjoining buildings and this they
succeeded in doing in spite of a stiff
breeze from the northeast, which put
the adjoining lumber yard of the Tay-lor-Estes
Company in danger.
The fire was well under control by
3 o'clock, but it was three hours later
before the men got back to the fire
station.
The only accident during the fire
was when one fireman fell from a
window ledge, letting the hose get
away from him and strike James M.
Taylor on the side of the head injur
ing his eye slightly.
Cause f Fire rnknown.
The cause of the fire is as yet un
known. The only plausible theory is
that the fresh hay or the bundles of
oats recently stored in the building
caught fire from spontaneous com
bustion. When seen this morning, the of
ficials of the Columbia Feed and
Grain Company could make no close
estimate of their loss.
"It will probably be between $3,
000 and $7,000," said E. V. Woods,
manager of the company. "We will
not know for certain until we open
the safe in a day or two and check
up on our stock. The insurance will
cover about half of this."
Flour was the biggest single item
in the loss, while wheat, corn, seed
corn, hay, oats, mill feed, stock food3,
poultry food and other items were in
cluded in the contents of the burned
building.
For the present the Columbia Feed
and Grain Company will have their of
fices with the Taylor-Estes Lumber
Company on Ninth street. No ar
rangements have yet been made for
continuing the business.
Buildlm: Valued at snwOO.
The destrocd building, which is
directly across from the Wabash de
pot, was built in 1902 at a cost of
$10,000. It was valued by the owners
at $7,500, of which $2,500 is covered
by insurance. No plans have yet been
made for replacing it.
While the yard and offices of the
Taylor-Estes Lumber Company were
saved by the good work of the fire
department, the latter lost two sets of
harness, valued at $150; and a feed
barn, valued at $150. About $60 worth
of oats was in the barn. None of this
was insured.
"The water pressure was low. but
this made little difference as the
fire was past control when we got
there," said Chief Kurtz this morn
ing. "There was nothing wrong with
our equipment, though we would
have been in a bad fix. had another
fire broken out about the same time.
Had this fire and the one on Conley
the night before come at the same
time I don't know what we would
have done."

plant, while repairing an electric line
on a ,0ie in front of Fredendall's de-
partment store about 10 o'clock this

DEUTSCHLAND
ARE MAGIC
The U-Boats Deutschland and
Bremen have done more to create uni
versal excitement in this country than
anything, with the possible exceptions
of the European War and the border
troubles. ,
Though we are living in the nine
teenth century and witchcraft Is a
thing of the past, it would take more
than the greatest of the magicians of
King Arthur's time to bring about the
things that have happened to the
Deutschland and Bremen according
to the reports received from various
places.
Here are some of the things that
have happened since the landing of
the Deutschland:
The Deutschland sailed every day
for twelve days.
It carried back $10,000,000 in gold.
It carried back a million-dollar
cargo.
It carried back a two-million dollar
cargo.
It brought over secret dispatches
from the Kaiser.
It took back secret dispatches to the
Kaiser.
It was the forerunner of a great
naval battle (which never occurred)
at the doors of Baltimore.
The Allied cordon was to be tor
pedoed by a fleet of "Deutschlands" in
sight of the American city.
It carried back tons of mail for the
soldiers.

It was believed by representatives
of both sides that mediation will start
immediately as demanded by the broth
erhoods. I! l'nlted I'ress.
NEW YOIIK, Aug. 9. Representa
tives of the 100,000 trainmen employed
on 22. railroads in the United States
earlier in the day said they would
not arbitrate demands for an 8
hour day and other concessions. Armed
with power to call a strike, tying up
230,000 miles of railroads, union heads
will discuss the questions involved
with railway oliicials.
This was the notice served upon the
railway managers today by A. B. Gar
retson, head of the conductor's broth
erhood. It brought the situation be-
' T "le. cml".ye35i employes to
a deadlock within an hour after the
first of their scheduled conferences
i wa3 called.
I Elisha I.ee, spokesman for the rail
road managers, declared the railroads
; would insist upon mediation. The un-
j ion representatives declared they
would not consent to an intermediary.
Members of the federal mediation and
conciliation board are now here, but
the brotherhood heads declare they
have no desire to see them.
With the conference deadlocked, the
meeting broke up and the railway
managers set out for the executive of
ficials. The brotherhood leaders went
into executive session.
J. It. I'ovtell on Vacation.
J. P. Powell, instructor in adver
tising in the School of Journalism of
the University, left today with his
family on a vacation trip up the Mis
sissippi. Mr. Powell will take a boat
at St. Louis. He will return in a week
or two.
AND BREMEN
SUBMARINES
cargo it carried 1,000 tons of copper
and rubber. (Its capacity was only
750 tons, so the gold and other odds
and ends were probably somewhat
crowded.)
It has twice been captured and
though no reports of its release have
ever been received, it seems to be free
at the present time.
Not to be outdone by her sister-ship,
the Bremen has also created a little
excitement. Here arc a few things
the Bremen has done:
It has landed at New Orleans, Balti
more and Washington.
While it was landing at these
places it lay at the bottom of the
ocean, a thousand miles away, crew
and boat lost because of disabled ma
chinery.
It has been captured by the Brit
ish. It has been captured by the French.
It has never sailed for the United
States.
It is not a merchant U-Boat, but a
warrior submarine. The Deutschland
was made a merchant boat to allow
the Bremen to travel in neutral wa
ters with less investigation.
It has been blown up.
Yet, some of these days we will
probably learn authentically that the
Bremen has landed, and that the
Deutschland has safely made her re
turn trip. Then, the membership of
the I-Told-You-So Society will in
crease by several million.
