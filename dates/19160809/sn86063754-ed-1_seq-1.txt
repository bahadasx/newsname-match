Mr. W. F. Stevenson, candidate
for Congress in the fifth dis
trict, states that tie is in receipt 1
of numerous communications
from voters in ihe district enclosing
the following letter:
House of Representatives, U. S.
Washington, D. C.
July 19, 1915.
Dear Sir:?
i urn avuuiug uui rigi i^unuiai
Yearbooks. I have less than
one thousand of these books as
my quota for distributing each
year. There are more than
twelve thousand farmers in the
District, so that it is impossible
for me to send each farmer a
Yearbook; however, in the event
that you do not receive one and
are especially interested and will
write me, I will make an effort
to secure a copy for you.
I have a number of Farmers*
Bulletins, in fact, a sufficient
number to go over the District,
nuu Oil) 3CUU1UK UUl lliese UISU.
I enclose you a list. If you will
mark a few bulletins on the list
that you are interested in and
will return it to me at Washington,
I will send these to you.
These bulletins contain much
valuable information on various
subjects.
If you have a pond or a stream
of water that you wish to stock
with fish and will wrtie me, I
will secure the fish for you and
toave them sent vou free of cost.
We have passed a Good Roads
Bill and also a Rural Credits
Bill.
I also hope to see you during
the summer and that you will
write me at any time I can be of
service.
~ Yours sincerely,
F. G. F. D. E. FINLEY.
The letters go in an envelope

With the letter is a printed list
of bulletins from Agricultural
department. Now, voters are
mailing these to Mr. Stevenson
and asking questions indicating
that they think there is an offer
of books and fish being made
for their support in the election.
One man endorses on his letter
the following, "Finley is offering
fish. What havo vnn or/^t "
Mr. Stevenson says that it is
impossible to write all voters,
and us this letter seems to have
been sent to all he takes this
method of answering: questions
being: raised.
First, he assumes that it is
purely in discharg: of his duty as
Congressman that Mr. Finley is
offering: to send out fish and
books, thougjh it is unfortunate
that he didn't make this offer
till he was in a campaign for re
election, as that might cause
persons of a suspicious nature to .
jMokc the uncharitable charge
in <t he expected support as a re
suit ot the offer.
Seccnd, Mr. Stevenson can no'
offer anything but the promise
of faithful, honest work as a
Representative of every man
and every interest in the district,
if elected, because (1) He has
no fish or books of his own to ;
give, nor can he as a private i
citizens draw on the United
States to send them free. (2) He i
is not able to write every voter i
in the district, because he cannot t
frank his letter as the Congress- i
man does, and the postage alone
will cost 1460. And (3), if he
had the fish and books and
could send them free, being a
private citizen who was under ;
no obligation to send out these i
things, he would violate the law i
to do so, because it savs that

As an aftermatb of the colored
Presbyterian Sunday School
picnic last Friday, Minnie Jackson
lies in her tiorae seriously
wounded with a bullet somewhere
in the back of her head,
while her husband, Henry Jackson
is a fugitive from justice.
Henry, it seems, has found
fault with his wife for some time
past and has on frequent occasions
threatened her with a pistol.
According to the testimony
of friends of both parlies it
seems that Aenry's jealousy, if
that was the cause, was without
foundation.
The shooting culminated at 10

asking: him to take dinner with
her at the picnic. He is reported
to have threatened her on the
way home and when they were
preparing: to return to the
church that night he opened fire
on his wife while she was standing
before the mirror dressing
her hair. The ball struck the
woman above the mouth and
lodged some where in the back
of her head. Her condition is
precarious.
Henry quickly left for parts
unknown.

Company and before astonished
uards could offer resistance
natched five of six bags in the
ar, said to have contained $33,
00 or $ 34,000 and escaped.
The hold-up took place on

isual afternoon throngs on
Voodward avenue,

vas shot through the thigh and

nd of a pistol, when he tried to
ntercept the robbers.
Witnesses declared the five
iandits apparently ranged in age
rom 18 to 60 years. No one,
lowever, seemed able to give a
ood description. They were
rmed with rifles and automatic
istols.
Witnesses of the daring rot>

Although policemen on moorcycles

ounded up tonight. Eleven
machines filled with officers

direction tonight after a
ruitless chase of 36 miles. Eary
this evening the bandits were

The amount obtained by the

and four men jumped out,

money.
Within two minutes after the
andit car drew alongside the
ay car, the former was racing
way with the five cash bags.
So far as can be learned not a
hot was fired by any of the
uards in the pay car, nor those

/hat was going on, but seeing

and twelve months of the year
and "edit" such stuff as this:

"John Doe climed on the roof
