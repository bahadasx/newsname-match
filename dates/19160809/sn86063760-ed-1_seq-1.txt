Newto3n D. F~aker, secretary of war,
replying to an injuiry from Gov. Man
ning as to the intentions of the war
department respecting the South Caro
lina units in the National Guard of
the United States. now cacamped at
Styx, near Columbia. intimated in a
letter to the governor. that the organi
zations in question would likely be
held until they are "completely equip
ped and ready in every respect to
mov2 . . . both as to strength and
equ=pment." Whether or not this
means that the units at Camp Moore
will be held there until recruited to
war strength nobody in Columbia or
at the camp was prepared to say. The
infantry regiments are far below war
strength, which is 150 men to the com
pany. Secretary Baker writes the
governor as follows:
"I take pleasure In acknowledging
your personal letter of the 17th in
stant, on the subject of the readiness
of your troops to go to the border, and
their great desire to see service there.
"In reply thereto, I want to expres
appreciation of the spirit animatifg c
ths South Carolina troops, together
with the hope that their desires and
your own may be speedily realized.
"On a recommendation from Gen. e
Funston. commanding the Southern
department. and in order to relieve
that department as far as possible of
the work of completing the equip
ment of the troops of the several
states orders were issued July 15,
1916, to department conanders. by
whom the movement of troops to the
border is regulated. to hed all organi
zations until they are completely
equipped and ready in every respect
to move. I take it. then, that as soon
as your state troops are completely
ready, both as to strength and equip
ment, the commanding general of the
Eastern department. who will be not!
fled by the mustering officer on duty
In your state, will promptly issue or
ders for their movement."
Officers in high authority at Camp
Moore realize that tMe one big prob
lem before the National Guard is that
of recruiting. More men must be' se
cured if the two regiments are sent
from South Carolina at an early date.
Col. Blythe of the First regiment,
commanding officer of the camp, be
lieves that the regiments will be call
ed for just as soon as they are needed
on the border. Camp facilities will
have to be provided and everything
made ready for the reception of new
units.
Nobody in the military service of
the United States, whether in the com
missioned or the enlisted personnel,
may act as a press correpondent, ac
cording to a ruling from the war de
partment.
p Field regulations prohibit, under
severe penalties, not only the acting as
a correspondent, but the giving of in
formation to the press or to civilians,
except by permission of competent au
tority. But a qutstion has existed
whether this rule was applicable in
times of peace and members of the
service hare been tacitly allowed to
serve newspapers from mobilization
points and training camps.
The department's ruling makes it
lear that this practice can not con

GREAT AIR ?AFT ALTITUDE
Italian Balloon Goes 104,082 Feet, or
Eighteen Miles, Above Actual
Ground Level.
According to the geographical in
stitute at Pavia, Italy, the highest al
itude so far reached b? any balloon
was 105,090 feet, or slightly over 18
miles above sea level; and 104,082
eet above actual ground, says the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch. The balloon was
of rubber andwas filled with hydrp
gen gas.
The actual distance traversed meas
ured 11G,064 feet. At a height of 59,
196 feet the temperature fell to minus
43 degrees and maintained that figure
all the balance of the way up with
only slight variation.
The aviator Giaccomo Piccolo, was
compelled to utilize his oxygen in
halator after he reached the height of
two miles, and reached ground In a
collapsed condition nevertheless.
Prof. Pericles Gambia, in the An
nali di Ufficio, states that the benefits
to science from that ascent were i
calculable, as it proved mainly two
things: That the assumption of a 15
mile atmosphere above the ground is
erroneous, and that the theory of
ether outside of that limit is not ad
missible, "if it does not altogether do
away with the ether theory at any
height." The word "ether" has been
formed to express the medium for
light beyond the assumed atmosphere.
This ascent establishes beyond per
adventure that the medium is uniform
after the height of about 50,000 feet
was reached. "If the a'tmospheric
consistency remains the same 55,000
feet after that altitude, the assump
tion that it will r6nain the same far
ther up reaches the dignity of a pre.
sumption."
The Annali suggests that the data
furnished by this ascent must, imper
atively, be substantiated by further
ascents before definite conclusions
should be drawn from this one alone.
OBJECTS TO PUBLIC DINNERS
Writer Unable to See Any Good Pur
pose Served by Custom That Has
Become General.
Why do men give dinners to other
men? And why do still other men en
courage those dinners by their pres
ence?
"You cannot be sure of any man's
success until he dies," is an old say
ing. If it is necessary, therefore, to
give a man a dinner in order to cele
brate something that he is supposed
to have done why not issue invitations
on the morning after his funeral? 'The
man himself, if he be a decent man,
would undoubtedly prefer to be a guest
at any dinner under these circum
stances-when he cannot hear what is
said about him.
You cannot get acquainted with any
one at a public dinner evenlif you
should desire to do so. The purpos'e at
every public dinner Is to - avoid any
thing sensible and to clog the'syste
with nicotine, alcohol and indigestible
food, not to mention bromides.
The American people are dinner
mad. In view of their obsession, their
passion for giving dinners, why not
reverse the process and give one to
every man who makes a failure? This
would increase the number of dinners
and would add materially to the gen
eral foolishness.-Exchang'e.I
His Weight.
A certain retired. tradesman admits
that- he is "a very poor judge of a
good horse," while the local blacksmith
claims to be "a good judge of a bad
one." And in this connection an amus
ing story is being told at the expense
of the former.
He had bonaght a very old horse ver~y
cheap, and took the animal down to
the blacksmith to be shod.
"Bow many shoes am I to put on?"
asked the blacksmith, critically sur
veying the antiquated steed. .
"Oh, four," said the owner; adding,
doubtfully. "if he's worth 'em."
The blacksmith put two shoes on
and then stopped.
--Mind you," he explained to the
proud owner of the "equine wreck,
"I'm not saying as your 'oss isn't
worth another couple o' shoes, but I'mn
quite certain as he's got as many as
he can carry away."
Chinese a Peaceful Race.
The prevailing spirit of China is
a peaceful spirit. Though having con
quered in many wars, China does not
look upon itself as a warring nation.
Its pride is in its scholars and its
sages.. It has always put the scholar
first in the social scale as the molder
af the ideals of the people; the farmer
second in a social scale as the pre
server of the necessities of the physi
al life; the soldier lowest in the so
rial scale because, as the Chinese say,
he is a taker of life. The Chinese say
it is idiony to kill a man because you
bhave a difference of opinion with him,
for to kill him settles nothing. The
enius of the Chinese race is for peace.
[n a quarrel they get toggther through
middleman, a peacemaker. Each con
edes somsthing, and an agreement is
arrived at.

Elephants. Curious Teeth.
Whoever has lookekinsi4 an ele

and they never eat Iesh, or any food
that requires itearin apart. Eighit
teeth are all they have, two above and
two below on eaech side, hig yeH~w
molars as wide as a man's hand,. Over
these hay or fodder is shiftell by the
queerest, ~agliest tongtle in thf'wifole
animal kingdom,a t'ongue that' is lit
erally hung at both ends having no
powerk of "movement- ex'eept in the
middle, where it shifts baek and forth
from the side, arching up against the
roof of the big'mouth like an immense
wrinkled pink serpest.
Elephants, like human lseings, have
