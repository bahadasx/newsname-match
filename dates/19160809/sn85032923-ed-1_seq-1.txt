NEW YORK. August 7. The task
of counting the votes of approximate
ly 400,000 railroad employes on the
f ucstion of authorizing a general
strike in the event that their demands
for an eight-hour day and time and a
half for overtime arc finally denied.
was completed just before noon to
day, it was announced at the brother
hoods' headquarters here.
It was learned from an authorita
tive sources that the vote was over
whelmingly in favor of a strike.
George W. W. Hanger of the Unit
ed States board of mediation and con
ciliation announced here today that
as a result of a conference between
icprcscntativcs of the Switchmen's
union of North America and the rail
roads both sides had agreed to settle
their differences by arbitration.
The differences between the switch
men and the railroads are in no way
connected with those pending be
tween the four railroad brotherhoods
of firemen, engineers, conductors and
trainmen.
The demands presented last March,
arc, however, virtually the same as
those of the brotherhoods, an eight-
hour day and time and a half for
overtime. Eastern and Middle West
ern railroads arc involved. The mem
bers of the union number 30,000.
The questions at issue will be set
tled by arbitration, Hanger said, un
der the Ncwlands act.
The full returns will be known at
10 a. m. tomorrow, when the leaders
of the men will re-submit their de
mands to the railroad managers.
Garrctson, the official spokesman
of the men, said today that the order
for the general strike would not be
given until all efforts to reach an
amicable agreement failed. While
citcrating that the men will not con
sider the railroads' plan of arbitra
tion under present conditions, , he
intcd that, if a different form of ar-
itration is proposed than under the
Ncwlands act, the men will meet the
railroads half way in avoiding a gen
eral strike. -
The contention of the brothcr-
oods has been that arbitrators ap
pointed under the Ncwlands act, on
previous occasions, have not been
sufficicntlv familiar with railroad con-
itions and the employes have suffcr-
I as the result of the awards.
The crisis in the railroad situation
as reached in this c?ty on June 15
st, when the conference between
ic representatives of JJa railroad
ystems in the United States and 400,-
000 employes failed to arrive at an ad-
ustmcnt of their differences. The
