CRIMSON CLOVER
"Ceatest Crop Ever Introduced In the
South" Is Claim of Those Who
Have Tried It
The question of improving the noils
of the south and this stats in particu
lar is engaging tbe attention of the
leading agriculturists in Tennessee.
In this connection a great campaign
tor legumes is on in three states, in
cluding Tennessee. We take the fol
lowing items from the Progressive
farmer on the subject of growing
crimson clover :
"One acre of good crimson clover
plowed under is worth as much as six
to ten tons of stable manure or a
thousand pounds ot cotton seed meal.
This clover gets its great amount of
fertilizer from the air, and gets it in
the winter and early spring, when cot
ton and corn lands are idle. Not only
does it hold your soils in winter and
keep them from washing away, but
day and night it is busy making you
and your lands richer."
"The greatest crop ever introduced
Into the south, is what those who
have tried crimson clover say of it. It
will grow practically anywhere cotton
and corn will grow, and as a tertilizer
and humus maker there is nothing
that beats it. , Thousands ot farmers
bave grown it successfully ; thousands
more will begin growing it this fall."
"Probably the most satisfactory
method of inoculating the seed, when
inoculated soil is used, is to dissolve
a,, oonta worth of common glue in
MTV w-
one gallon of water, moisten one bush
el ot seed (60 pounds) with this solu
tion of glue and then mix with 30
poundsjof the inoculated soil and sow
and cover the seed lightly at once."
"The claim made tor this method is
that when the young plants start from
tbe seed the germs are present in the
oil sticking to the seed, ready to inoc
ulate the roots, prompt inoculation
thus being assured."
From now to the middle of Septero
ber is the time for sowing crimson
clover. So, you need not feel that it is
too late to prepare. Sow it in your
corn and scratch it in with your 14
tooth cultivator and yon can have a
good late pasture, good early pasture
in the spring and have a good coat of
manure to turn under about May I for
another corn crop.
HOME BURNED
Residence of Shade Stephens Destroyed
Sunday, About Noon.
Sunday about 11 o'clock the home of
Shade Stevens, two and a half miles
east of town was discovered on fire.
The fire had gained such headway be
fore it was discovered that all efforts
to save the house were fruitless and
i ..,ii amount of clothiner and
UH1' niiiou 11
bedding, along with a tew other ar
ticles were saved.
The tire originated in the kitchen flue
and the kitchen was wrapped in flames
and the main residence was also burn
ing when it was discovered. Mr. Ste
vens, wite, daughter and Henry Bar
nett were sitting in tront of the house
but failed to discover the fire until it
was beyond control.
Mr. Stevens is a man of small means
and is well advanced in years, being
over 70. He has the small farm where
he resides but no other resources. He
is a quiet and clever citizen and many
will deeply regret his loss.
THINK IT HAS CARRIED.
While tbe result of the constitutional
convention vote Thursday is not defi
nitely known, the feeling prevails with
those best informed that the "For a
reinvention" won and the convention
will be held.
The real status of the situation will
be known in a few days.
The vote in the four large cities of
the state was strongly in favor of the
convention, otherwise it would have
been defeated by a large majority.
The Art Circle Library is now in
Mrs. DeGolia's building. Open on
Tuesdays and Saturdays from 2 :30 un

SHERIFF AND 'SESSOR
Tollett Wins by 70 Votes, Patton by 99
and M. L Taylor Defeats T. M.
Brady for County Board of
Education 119 Votes.
The election last Thursday went off
with the usual quiet and good order and
resulted in the election of Samuel Tol
lett, socialist-democrat, tor sheriff,
over John Q. Wyatt. republican, by 70
votes , J. E. Patton, republican, over
L. W. Martin, democrat, by 99 votes.
J as. Smith, republican, was unopposed
for trustee. M. L. Taylor, independ
ent democrat, defeated T. M. Brady,
regular democrat, for Board of Educa
tion for the county at large, by 119
votes.
The constitutional convention won
by 42 votes ; 356 being cast tor the con
vention and 14 against, making a total
vote on the question 670.
The total vote in the county for
county officers was light, being only
1,042, a little over two-thirds of a tull
vote.
WhenJudse O. P. Brunett was till
ing out the report to the state board of
elections he asked the usual question
of sheriff -e ct Samuel Tollett as to his
politics. Mr. Tollett raplied that he is
a socialist-' . locrst and it was so en
tered on the lection returns.
The numt i : "70" seems to be some
thing of a 'hoodoo" for the republi
cans for tystturtor T. E. Wilson carried
the county by that same number of
votes tour ycr ago when he ran for
the lower houarof" the legislature.
At five precincts the convention re
ceived every vote, and failed to re
ceive any votes at one precinct Mill
stone and there only 4 votes were cast
against it.
In the race for tax assessor L. W.
Martin carried the third district for
the first time by a demourat. Patton
for assessor received every vote at one
precinct and all except one vote at two
other precincts. In the race for sher
iff both candidates received one or
more votes at each precinct. The
largest number of votes cast against
the constitutional convention was at
Burgess in the third district. Cross
ville stood second but the convention
won by a small majority. No election

Misses Jessie Rice and Mildred Min
gis were at Weatel Tuesday night the
guests of Miss Edna Swing.
Claud Loden, of Harriman, was here
Sunday between trains.
Prof. March, of Crossville, filled his
appointment here Saturday night and
Sunday.
Dock Scott came home from F.mory
Gap Saturday night with a badlly
bruised leg, caused by falling over a

Shirley Copeland, of Emory Gap,
was here between trains Sunday.
Mrs. M. H. Rice accompanied Mrs.

A camping party composec of Misses
Anna Hunter, Beatrice Sabine, Irene
Carver, Cora Mangren and Messrs
on the convention was held at one pre
cinct. In the race between M. L. Taylor
and I. M. Brady for County Board of
Education, county at large, Taylor re
ceived every vote at two precincts and
Brady at one.
FIRST DISTRICT.
S. A. Tucker won for district mem
ber of the County Board of Education
over A. C. Hyder. The vote stood :
Tucker 847, Hyaer 124, making the
vote of Tucker one less than two to
one.
For constable J. C. Hyder and I. E.
Hamby had no opposition, this district
being allowed two constables. Mr.
Hyder received 216 votes and Mr.
Hamby 251.
SECOND DISTRICT.
Owing to some dissatisfaction that
arose over tbe recent distribution of
teachers Sam Nelson was defeated for
district member of the Board of Edu
cation by Carrol Elmore. Mr. Elmore
received 113 votes and Mr. Nelson 46.
Mr. Nelson was one of the most cap
able men on the board and if Mr. El
more makes as good a member in gen
eral as did Mr. Neson his district will
have no cause for complaint.
There were six men voted for in the
race for constable and they received
the following vote: Tom Taylor 6,
Riley Wyatt 3, J. M. Houston 5, J. Z.
Goss 2, H. L. Woody 1. J. D. Wyatt 1,
which shows that the question of elect
ing a constable aroused little interest.
THIRD DISTRICT.
G. W. Davenport and Thomas Selby
were voted for as members ot the
Board of Education.
Mr.;Davenport received 64 and Mr.
Selby 56.
In the race for constable there were
three men voted for: W. P. Bradley
received 72 votes, Henry rivfllivan 38,
John Pooshee 17.
FOURTH DISTRICT.
There were three men voted for in
the race for district member of the
County Board of Education: W. C.
Renfro, who has been a member tor
two years, and E. C. James, a young
school teacher, and Schooler Watson.
It seems practically sure that Mr. Wat
son was not seeking the nlace as he re
ceived only four votes and they at his
home precinct. Mr. Kenfro received
a total of 102 votes and Mr. James 64.
In the race for constable there were
three men vi ted for: Hickey Smith
was the successful candidate and re
ceived 86 votes, James Hedgeccoth 63,
Harvey Carter 39.

COMPARISON IMPOSSIBLE
German Situation Unlike Any Other Peo
ple in Previous Wars.
The present juncture m the great
war lend itself readily to comparisons
too interesting to resist. Prophecies
based upon them, however, are dan
gerous, and comparisons are odorous,
as Mrs. Malaprop said. It is not diffi
cult to see why this is so when the
comparisons are analyzed.
General Joffre is reported to have
likened the desperate Germai assault
upon Verdun to the equally desperate
assaults of Lee's army at Gettysburg.
Immediately we recall that up to this
point the Confederacy had waged the
more brilliant warfare ; that after it
came the military genius of Grant and
the invasion ol the south ; that an un
trained northern army had hitherto
fought clumsily against the more skil
ful leaders just as the allies have done
until recently, and that after twenty
months of hammering away the north
ern forces were ready to fight efficient
ly ; that after Gettysburg the south's
lack of resources began to show.
NOT ALIKE.
A tempting comparison it is we
might go farther and compare Grant,
simple and efficient, with Joffre, simole
and efficient but there are obstacles
to hinder the planting of victorious al
lied army in Berlin with Germany un
der the heel or the conqueror, as Grant j
planted his army in Richmond and held j
the south helpless.
DIFFERENT ECONOMICALLY.
We do not know much about the re- j
sources and economic conuuions oi
Germany today, but we do know that
they cannot be what those of the south
were at the beginning of the end.
The federal government started the
civil war with control of both tbe sea
and oi the nation s industrial centers,
and having the resources of the world
to draw upon. The Teutons have never
yet been so hemmed in, despite the
British blockade. They have hammer
ed their way to the east and they still
have some source of supply there.
NOT ORGANIZED.
In the civil war the south was not
organized industrially. With no labor
except slave labor, it raised cotton and
depended upon the rorthwest for food
supplies and upon the northeast for
mechanical devices. It lacked not only
a chance to get munitions from the
outside world, but it had no factories
and knew practically nothing about
manufacture.
GERMANY ORGANIZED.
Germany's wonderful industrial or
ganization, her capacity tor sen sup
port if cut oft' from the outside world,
is the converse of this. Moreover, ad
vances like those of the northern armies
into the southland are not being made
in the territtic machine-fought warfare
of today, even against a much weaker
enemy, when that enemy Knows the
gauie. Advances now are iiieasured by
yards, not miles.
STRENGTH NOT TESTED.
Indeed, the allies have not yet tested
the powerful defenses within the
fatherland. They have taken the
offensive, but on their own territory.
Germany is today in possession of most
of Belgium, with its manufacturing
centers. They boast that they hold 60
Der cent of tbe French . industrial re
gions. They are in Poland, in the Bal
tic Provinces. And Germany has al
lies.
Greman sympathizers have already
countered Joffre s comparison with an
other comparison, that of Germany on
the defensive now with Prussia on the
j defensive, even invaded by a tar su
i nerior force, in the seven years war,
I when Maria Theresa of Austria, wish
1 ing to recover Silesia, succeeded in
aliening with Austria against Freder-
: ick the Great most of Europe Russia,
Sweden, Saxony and France.
The battle of Kunnersdorf in 1759
was so disas. rous to the Prussian arms
that Frederick wrote to a confidant :
"all's lost save the royal family. The
consequences of this battle will be
worse than the battle itself. I shall
not survive the ruin of the fatherland. '
But the Hohenzollerns and the fath-
erland are still doing business at the
old stand, and on a much more lavish
scale.
FORMER WAR COST HEAVY.
Nor was the seven years' war mere
child's play. Itcosi 1,000,000 lives an
14,600 houses in Prussia alone were
burned. Frederick, on the verge ot
ruin, staved it off, and laid the founda
tions of the present empire.
And yet this, too, is an unsatisfact
ory basis for comparison with condi
tions today. English gold and English
activity, particularly against ths
French, English successes in Canada
helped to save Frederick, while ths
Empress Elizabeth of Russia died at a
very opportune time for him, and Peter
111, pro-Germanic in his sympathies,
withdrew Russia lrom the enemy align
ment. Germany is on the defensive, per
haps temporarily, perhaps permanent
ly, and she is fighting against powerful
odds. But it is vet to be proved that
in modern warfare powerful odds can
administer decisive defeat. Boston

GREAT CHANGE IN THE WAR,
Germany Three Times Tries io Crush
Her Enemies But Fails.
The last days of the second year of
the world conflict saw a momentous
change. For the brat time the initia
tive on all fronts pained te the enemies
of the Central Powers.
In the East, tl C West, and the South,
German and Autriar troops stood on
the defensive, onti.uuihpred and sensi
bly recoiling untie; fnrivtti assaults of
Russian, ltali :.. British, and French
troops. Even m t.ie Balkans formid
able Allied boiiihi-rdtuetrts seemed to
forecast an attack upon Bulgaria and
Salomca. Nowhere save about Ver
dun, now without impottance, did the
Germans take the lead and here the
results were immaterial, as they were
inconsidf rable.
Not less significant was the fact that
at last tl.e great British army showed
itself ready for the operation which
had long been expected of it and twice,
at Neuve Chapelle and Loos, demanded
of it in vain. These lines are written
too soon after an opening of the British
attack to warrant any estimate of the
hunting quality the new armies have
displayed, but after nearly three weeks
they are still going forward and the
blunders of Loos and Neuve Chapelle
have not been repeated.
Looking backward we see now the
whole great war drama untolded in
three acts : The German effort to dis
pose of France, which ended in the
failure at the Marne and the stalemate
in Flanders ; the German effort to dis
pose of Russia, which terminated in
the Pinsk Marshes and terminated ia
failure; the Greman effort to exhaust
France, morally as well as physically,
which came to naught in April, when
the French were able to repulse the
most desperate of the German assaults
upon the Meuse linea and thereafte
to hold them to a struggle without im-
prtance o' issue.
Three times Germany, surrounded
by enemies richer in men, in money, in
all material resources, and having ab
solute control ot the sea, strove to
break the circle of tire about ner and
dispose of one of her foes, as Napoleon
disposed of Austria at Austerlitz,
Prussia at Jena, and Russia at Fried
land in the first and tortunate phase of
his great career as Emperor. Three
times she failed.
Under her blows France and Russia
staggered, but did not fall. Meantime
there was left to Britain the time to
make her new armies, to arm her mil
lions and put them on the tiring-line.
They are now there. - From "Germany
Loses the Initiative - Britain Begins,"

Review ot Reviews for August, 1916.
DUETSCHLAND SAILS.
Last week, Thursday, the great
merchant boat, the Duetschland, left
Baltimore on its tetiirn trip to Ger
many. It was loaded with rubber and
nickel. The vessel submerged just af
ter parsing out of the cape? and so far
as known, successfully evaded the
watching English and French ships.
