CHICKASHA
OFFICERS
ARE ACTIVE
Police Produce Fines Aggregating $C500
During First Twelve Months of Pres
ent Administration
That the police force during the
present administration has been alive
was shown this morning in an Inter
view with Mayor Coffman, who report
ed that during the first twelvemonths
of his administration the police court
had assessed fines to the amount of
$5500 as against $1790 In the preced
ing year.
Probably fifty of these cases were
for speeding on Chickasha avenue. It
Is impossible for two policemen to be
in forty places at one time," he as
serted, "but considering that this town
of about 15,000 is being policed by two
officers, they have accomplished much
in the way of, reducing speeding. The
city has six policemen on the force but
these are divided into three shifts of i
eight hours each, making only two po
licemen for duty at any one time.
ThexC tu ui
usually employed on
Chickasha avenue or close to it, when
not called elsewhere on duty. We
have no extra men for an emergency,
and therefore up to the present time
we have not been in a position to com
bat the evil of speeding on highways
In the suburbs of Chickasha. These
men are now doing about three times
as much,' as any policemen which we
have! ever had."
DAUGHTER SHOT.
Police headquarters were notified
this afternoon of a shooting at 27 Iowa
avenue and officers were sent to the
Rpot. It developed that the excite
ment arose over the cries of Rebecca
Griffin, who had just received a letter

AWAKENED
BY AWFUL
EXPLOSION
Chickasha Man Was Guest at New York
Hotel When Terrible Black Tom
Island Tragedy Occurred
When the terrific explosion of am
munition at Black Tom Island awak
ened Will Owsley from his slumbers
In a seventeenth story room of the
McAlpin hotel, New York City, In the
early morning of July 30, his first
thought was of a subway explosion
but explanations ranging all the way
from the Germans to Black Hand
bombs presented themselves before
the cause was known.
Mr. Owsley says ho and his wife
were awskened as if by a monstrous
clap of thunder and although the
scene of the explosion was six miles
from the hotel, it seemed as if It were
immediately in front of the building
From two until four o'clock that morn
ing Mr. and Mrs. Owsley joined the
crowd of spectators on top of the ho.
tel. watching the wonderful and spec
tacular sight. '
"Although I have never been in a
war, I think tho series of explosions
following one after another could be
compared to the sound of battle," said
Mr. Owsley. "I never saw so much
broken glass in my life, and soldiers
were still guarding the broken win
dows In the wholesale jewelry district
when we left New York."
