IMPRESS
STRAWBERRIES RAISED
SUCCESSFULLY HERE
For Several Years Past Increasing
Interest Has Been Taken in the
Growing of the Berry on
Cook County Farms
The raising of strawberries in
Cook county has been very interest­
ing to us during the past two or
three years, especially at this time
of year when we have seen the
berries brought to the village for
market, and we were treated to a
good sight for sore eyes a few days
ago by the inspection of Sheriff
Lien's strawberry patch in the vil­
lage. In one patch we found large
and lucious berries, which he in­
formed us has been furnishing him
berries for some time for his own
use, and which has yielded bounti­
fully. Another patch of the ever­
bearing variety will soon ripen, and
will continue to bear until frost sets
in. This is the variety which he
prizes most highly and which he be­
lieves will be the best variety for
this county.
Sheriff Lien has prepared several
acres a couple of miles west of the
village, and judging by the appear­
ance of his garden, and the care and
study he gives it, we feel that lie is
setting a good example that can be
profited from by us all, whether we
have a large farm 01* simply a small
piece of ground in the village. There
is 110 question in our mind but that
if every citizen in Cook county could
inspect this strawberry patch, next
year would see very few lots or farms
without a start in raising straw­
berries, even if we had only a plot
of ground ten feet square available
for that purpose.

holders of the Cook county State

G. F. Lundquist Cashier. They voted
to increase the capital stock from
$10,000 to $25,000 which will be ef­
fected as soon as the formalities
can be gone through.

COOK COUNTY CONDITIONS
IMPROVE IN FIFTEEN YEARS
Farmers Are Prosperous and Take
Pride in Their Farms—Straw­
berries Sqoii to be a Big
Crop in County.
Fifteen years ago the farmers of
Cook County were discouraged and
dissatisfied with their lot, afraid to
put money or effort into permanent
improvements 011 their farms, using
their farms only for raising a little
for their owif comfort and use, and
as a rule thev were making their
living by working in the woods in
the winter and on the roads in the
summer. Their interest in road mak­
ing, if it did not adjoin their ojvn
property, or if it was not one of the
roads used by them regularly was
only as to how much work building
of the road would give them.
At the present time the conditions
have all been reversed. Our farmers
are our best assets and citizens.
They are generally prosperous, proud
of their farms and full of plans for
a new barn, residence, more clearing,
more cattle, and other improvements.
The shipping of cream and butter
is in its infancy, and promises to in­
crease greatly within the next year
or two. The cultivation of an acre
or two of strawberries on each farm
will be an additional source of rev­
enue for Cook County within a year
or two, and Cook County straw­
berries, on the market at a time
when all other strawberries are har­
vested, will bring a top notch price
and the demand will be far greater
than the supply.
In regard to road building, we be­
lieve that Cook County can look any
county in the state square in the
eye, as we are building roads that
we may well feel proud of, consider­
ing the fact that Cook County has
the smallest assessed valuation in
the state.
Our farming, which has been so
much belittled by our citizens and
by outsiders in the past, has de­
veloped into a permanent growing
institution, and will continue to in­
crease at an ever aeeelcrating rate,
until all of our land is made pro­
ductive.
OFFICIALS TAKE AN AUTO TRIP
Nearly the whole official family of
Cook county took an auto trip to
Two Harbors last*Saturday, returning
home the next day. In the party
were all the members of the county
board, the county auditor, clerk of
court, county treasurer, register of
deeds ,county attorney, county sur­
veyor, deputy highway engineer, ye
editor and Oscar Olson.
The trip was made principally for
pleasure and incidentally to satisfy
a curiosity on the part of people
generally as to the exact condition
of our much talked of North Shore
Boulevard. The trip was very much
Enjoyed by all. While all were well
enough acquainted with the condi­
tion of the roads in this county and
found nothing in that respect to sur­
prise them, they were surprised to
see the great amount of road work
that has been and is being done in
Lake county. With the exception of
a few miles west of Cramer they
found the entire road through Cook
and Lake counties in excellent condi­
tion—in such excellent condition as
should be a cause of wonderment to
the average traveler from abroad.
And as in this county, Lake is en­
ergetically pushing the work of her
road improvement, so that the time
is very short when there will not be
between Duluth and Giand Marais a
stretch of highway in such condition
as to mar the pleasure of the trip.
One must, take a ride over this
road to realize fully its natural at­
tractions and to be convinced that
its popularity can never grow less
that it is bound to be a self-adver­
tiser, becoming famed as among the
greatest driveways in this or any
other country. This is no reckless
boast. We don't expect to be many
years older when Cook county will
enjoy the proofs of this prediction
and there will be none to be found
to begrudge the fathers of this great
enterprise the credit due them. The
North Shore Boulevard will more
than any other public undertaking
bring Cook county into her own.
At a meeting of the School board
of Ind. Dist. No. 1 held last night
the resignations of Miss vEdith Monk
er and Miss Adeline Berglund as
teachers of the Good Harbor Hill
and Rose Bush schools were receiv
ed and accepted. Miss Ella Gilbert
son was elected to teach the Rose
Bush school and the other position is
unfilled. As to the plans of the
retiring teachers we do not know,

LOCAL CONTRACTOR IS
SUCCESSFUL BIDDER
Ed Nundstedt Secures the Contract
for the Building of the Tofte
School—Was the Lowest
of Eight Bidders
The bids for the construction of a
new graded school building at Tofte
were opened last Monday and the
contract was awarded to Ed Nun­
stedt, he being the lowest bidder. In
all, eight bids were received, the
successful bid being $8,798.00 and
the other bids ranged from a little
less than $10,000 to $12,000. Mr.
Nunstedt plans to begin work 011 it
the first part of next week, the, con­
tract calling for completion by No­
vember 15th.
The building is to be 40x66, con­
crete basement and a frame building
of two stories. It will be steam
heated and modern in every x'espect.
COUNTY SUNDAY SCHOOLS
HELD THEIR CONVENTION
On Saturday afternoon the outside
visitors to the Cook County Sunday
$chool convention arrived in three
pars, all of the visitors making the
trip overland. Those here were Mr.
and Mrs. Locker of St. Paul, Mr. and
Mrs. Tom Owens, and Mr. and Mrs.
Crane, Mr. Manning and Mr. Smith of
Two Harbors and Mr. Locker, Jr., of
Minneapolis.
A meeting was held on Saturday
night in the Congregational church
after which a street meeting was
held on our business street. On Sun­
day morning a meeting was held in
the Congregational church and in the
afternoon and evening the meetings
were held in the Norwegian Luther­
an church. The meetings were all
well attended. Mr. Locker is the
secretary of the state Sunday school
association.
TO THE FISHERMEN
We are in receipt of a communi­
cation from Joseph Croft who charg­
es that some of the fishermen are
dumping fish offal into the lake. He
.makes the assertion that this prac­
tice is one of the causes of the
•staying in-shore of the fish for so
short a time. He takes the stand
that if the offal were not dumped
into the lake, the fish would stay
in-shore for longer periods, giving
the fishermen more than a few days
of good fishing at a time. Some
complaint has also been received in
regard to dumping sawdust so close
to the water edge that it gets into
the water. This is according to some
fishermen even more detrimental to
the fishing industry than dumping
offal into the lake and drive the fish
away.
Our fishing industry is a valuable
resource and should be conserved to
the best of our ability. As much as
we dislike seeing anyone in trouble
we hope (if nothing else will stop
the dumping of fish offal and saw
dust into the lake) that there will
be brought into court, any offender
who shows so little regard for the
fishing industry as to dump offal or
allow sawdust to polute the lake
water to the detriment of the fish­
ing industry.
The dumping of fish offal in the
lake or of sawdust is an offense pun­
ishable by a fine not exceeding $100
or ninety days in jail .It would not
seem to be necessary to bring any
offenders into court to stop this
practice but probably it would be
the quickest way.
BOND ISSUE TO BE VOTED ON
At a meeting of the town board
of the town of Maple Hill he'd yes­
terday afternoon it was voted to
submit to the voters of the town a
question as to whether or not they
should issue road and bridge bonds
in the sum of $25,000 for the purpose
of improving the Gun Flint road,
building a bridge acros the Devil's
Track river near the East side school
and making other improvements on
their roads. The issue will be de­
cided by the voters on August 21st
and the sentiment is decidedly in
favor of the issuance of the bonds.
The town of Maple Hill has no
bonded indebtedness at the present
time and has only a small amount
of unpaid outstanding warrants.
And now they tell us that flour
is going up and gasoline is going
down. No consolation is that for us.
There will be a Union meeting at
the Maple Hill Swedish Lutheran
church next Sunday afternoon at 3
o'clock. The people of Grand Marais
and vicinity are cordially invited to
attend. The church has recently un­
dergone extensive repairs consisting
of the interior being redecorated and
the outside painted.

OUR EQUIPMENT INI
BY SLUG-CASTING MACHl
News-Herald Adds a Linograph
Equipment to Increase Facili­
ties for Handling Newt
and Job Work.
The Cook County News Herald has
recently added a Linograph to its
equipment, to be better prepared for
giving our readers a good paper, also
to be prepared to do considerable of
the work at home that we have here­
tofore had to send to Duluth and
other points for setting up.
This is a slug casting machine,
setting up and casting each line sep­
arately. The capacity of the mach­
ine is about two columns an hour,
provided the operator is ar, expert,
a speed which will be beyond us for
several years. The machine wili turn
out as much work as five men at
the old hand setting process.
Mr. J. .Penning, of Davenport,
la., has been with us the past week
putting the machine in, and while
our progress in learning the intrica­
cies of Linograph operating has not
been anything remarkable, we are
well pleased and can promise you a
better paper, containing more news,
and will promise to further the in­
terests of Cook County with your co­
operation.
NEWTON TRIAL CONTINUED
The trial of John Newton 011 a
charge pj furnishing liquor to the
Indians was brought up for trial on
yesterday morning before Justice
Brenton and was continued un­
til the 21st of August, on account
of the absence of a material witness
for the state.
TROLLING SEASON OPEN
The trolling season on Lake Super­
ior will soon be here and already
parties are a daily occurence. A few
successful trips have been made and
there will be many fish caught on
the trolling spoon from now on.
Mr. and Mrs. A. D. Morton and
family, Geo. B. Kieler and Ray Lin
derman of Bartlesville. Okla., are
visitors at the Hotel Paine.

TO BE
.^^^tGED THIS FALL
Addition on NortlT Side of About 28
by 60 Feet to be Added—The
Present Office Space to
Enlarge Dining Room
F. R. Paine is planning- to double
the capacity of his hotel this fall by
the building of an addition on the
North side of about 28 feet wide by
60 feet long. The new part will be
full three stories, anl will conform
in construction with the rest of the
building. According to the present
plans, the office will occupy the
northwest corner of the building, the
present office being used to enlarge
the dining room.
This enlargement has been made
necessary by the large number of
cars taking advantage of the open­
ing of the North Shore Automobile
road, there being ve,y few nights in
the past month that the hotel has
not been filled to capacity and
guests have been forced to seek ac­
comodations elsewhere.
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU?
That we occasionally have an irate
caller, either in the ofi'ice or on the
street, who as ks us why we did not
print a news item about some mat­
ter in which he or flie is interested.
It is impossible for any newspaper to
get all the news of a community and
we wish to ask you to call on us or
telephone us (our telephone is No.
3f) if you have any news, and we
will gladly give it space in our col­
umns.
LAUNCH ETHEL MAKES
AN INTERESTING TRIP
A party consisting of the Misses

village en Sunday afternoon. The
trip was made in the launch "Ethel"
and was greatly enjoyed by those
making the trip. The exacting in­
vestigation by the Canadian immi­
gration Department of the party and
the boat was a little strenuous for
a while but alter they were satis­
fied they did everything that they
could to guide and direct the party.
