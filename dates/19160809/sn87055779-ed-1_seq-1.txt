BILL LEGALIZES
Sill U.S.
Measure Exempting Combi
nations is Blow at Al
lies' Boycott.
International News Sendee:
WASHINGTON'. Auff. 9. The ad
ministration has taken the first step
in its campaign to offset the effects
of the British boycott on American
trade and at the same time furnish
a potent argument to get the Wilson
McAdoo ship purchase bill through
the senate.
Chairman Webb of the house ju
diciary committee, today began work
en the favorable report to be made
on the foreign selling agenef.s bill.
This measure exempts from the I
criminal clause of the anti-trust laws
all the combinations of merenants
or individuals organizing foreign
selling agencies. Instead. such
agencies are legalized, under the ju
risdiction of the federal trade com
mission. It is argued that such com
binations which can represent any
one or make trade lines, will furnish
a. potent weapon where Hritish or
any other foreign competition can
be met on its own ground and price
cutting dealt with in a way which
already has made possible some of
the biggest trade combinations now
doing business.
To Await .More Facts.
It is authoritatively stated that
this legislation will be forced
through congress before adjourn
ment and would be the only legisla
tion of a retaliatory nature provided
at this session. To all demands for
more specific action against the en
tente boycott, or against the trade
agreement reached in Paris by the
entente allies and their sympathizers,
th.e administration position will be,
officials say. that no further legisla
ton can be attempted u"til all the
facts are shown.
Ship Hill to He I'p.
However, the administration fol
lowers will use th boycott up the
most potent of their arguments for
the passage of the administration

iatter legislation was called up in the
senate today. It face repuhlican
opposition, hut has pained many
democratic votes in the upper body
since the senate rejected it at the
last session. Republicans, however,
intend presenting strong opposition
and passage will be delayed as much
as possible.

WASHINGTON. Aug. 9. That

with a prospect that all records for
bitterness will be exceeded hefore
the votes are counted was conceded j
today. The act.on of Sec'y of Com
merce Redfield, now on vacation,
and Acting Sec'y Edwin F. Sweet,
in directly wiring- the republican
presidential candidate, Charles
Evans Hughes, that his charges that
the -department had violated the
civil service were "fale and mis
leading," was slid to have been a
direct result of a telephone confer
ence between Pres't Wilson and Na
tional Chairman McCormick.
The Hughes charges dealt with
the reorganization of the coast and
geodic survey ar.d both Redfield and
Sweet insisted that in both instances
the heads of the departments men
tioned were selected for merit and
not for political worth. By direc
tion of the white house, the depart
ment of commerce is preparing full
details of the changes in the two
bureaus which will be used in a
statement later amplifying the tele
grams sent to Justice Hughes at
Chicago last night.
Compile .Much Data.
Friends of the president today
were urging him to advance the date
of notification and directly charge
his opponent. Justice Hughe, with
making an erroneous statement.
Already a large quantity of data has
been compiled from the official rec
ords to answer the Hughes Mexican
charges. A hurry-up call was sent
to administration lenders in congress
today to get together the data to
reply to the Heches attack upon the
"pork barrel' lan r.iL'ht In his Ch"-
