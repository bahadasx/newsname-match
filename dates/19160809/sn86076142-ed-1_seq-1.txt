the scope of the conferences widened

It was not until 3:30 o'clock this
morning that precinct No. 3, at the
Tonopah - High school, completed
counting the ballots and the tired
officers of election betook themselves
homeward. The first precinct heard
from was No. 2, where the work was
in charge of Eddie Addison and a
corps of trained accountants, who
had the most perfect arrangements
of any In the township. Most of the
men were experienced, but the fact
that Mr. Addison was familiar "with
every detail ot the counting was
really responsible for the celerity
shown at that polling place. In No.
1 the only serious division in the
vote came with a split in the Demo
cratic senatorial delegations, the vote
showing an equal break with four
delegates each for McCarran and
Pittman. At No. 4 the officers were
drawn chiefly from the ranks ot the
new voters and there was some delay
In getting started on the right path,
but the ladles stuck valiantly to their
jobs and succeeded in counting the
last ballot shortly after midnight.
The voting was light, over thirty
per cent of the registered voters not
asking for representation. Out of a
total registration of 1621, 1124 votes
were cast, showing 497 not voting.
In 1914, 1463 registered and there
were 1300 votes cast. The summary
of the day's voting follows:

The new system of conducting pri

cluniBy that human Ingenuity ever
devised, with an endless amount of
red tape that had to be unfurled
before the tired officers could close
their polling places.
No provision was made for receiv
ing the ballot boxes at the courthouse
and at a late hour last night several
judges and clerks of election were
wandering around town with the
huge galvanized boxes In tow looking
for some responsible officer to re
ceive them. The first outside pre
cinct to be beard from was Belmont,
which arrived this morning shortly
after 8 o'clock. No informal ballot
accompanied the box and therefore
nothing could be learned of the re
sult. The county commissioners will
begin canvassing the returns on Fri
day if the boxes are all In and, if not,
they will take up the count on Mon
day or Tuesday.
