while the others were uninjured ex

Lyndonville and were just south of
the brickyard coming into St Johns
bury. Behind the Gadapee car were two
other machines and another automo
bile was going north that Mr. Gada
pee was about to turn out for. The
driver of the second machine in line
directly behind, saw what looked like
a good chance to go by the Gadapee
car but did not see the auto coming
until too late to fall back in line.

FIVE AREUNHURT
Auto-truck With Load Of Eight
Was Returning From Trip To
Mountains In Company With Two
Other Machines All Are Pinned
Under Wreck When Right Rear
Wheel Collapses Causing Car To
Turn Over
Albert L. Douglas, the town road
commissioner, was killed' and two
others injured out of a party of eight
in an automobile accident that took
place at 8 o'clock Sunday night be
tween the Blodgett and Mark Hovey
farms on the road to East St. Johns-
bur j '. when one of the wheels of the
machine collapsed, causing the car to
run up a bank and turn over end for
end. The entire party was pinned be
neath the car but with the assistance
that arrived from a car just ahead
they were extricated and none were
found to Be seriously injured except
Mr. Douglas, although a later exam
ination found Joseph Duclose suffer
ing from a fractured collar bone and
Mi's. Ernest Fontaine severely bruis
ed about the back and chest and with
possible internal injuries.
Mr. Douglas was on the the return
with a party of his road employes and
their wives from a trip to the moun
tains in the big Jeffery truck owned
by the town.
The party composed of Mr. and
Mrs. Joseph Duclose, Mr. and Mrs.
Ernest Fontaine, Dennis Lapoint and
wife and Joseph Baril, together with
two other machine loads, one of
which was driven by William Doug
las, a son 'of the dead man, left St.
Johnsbury about 8 o'clock Sunday
morning for a trip to the mountains.
There were 20 in all in the party.
On the return trip Mrs. Douglas
was in the first car to return and
reached home before she heard of
the accident. But the car driven by
the son, William, was a short distance
ahead of the big truck when the ac
cident occurred.
According to William Douglas' story
they were proceeding at a rate be
tween 20 and 25 miles an hour
when those in the rear seat heard
something crack and turning they
saw the car turn up the - bank and
turn completely over end for end and
crash down with its occupants be
neath. They hurried back and lifted
the car enough to .liberate those who
were uninjured. The son, William
Douglas, was the first to reach the
scene and after helping to remove his
father from the wreck hurried to his
car and drove home where he put in
an emergency call. Dr. Miltimore and
the ambulance from Stanley's re
sponded. Albert Douglas lived about
five minutes after the doctor arrived
The remains were taken to Stanley's
undertaking parlor, where it was
found that the body was terribly
crushed. The base of the skull was
fractured, the ribs on both sides
broken, one hip fractured, forehead
badly cut, one thumb cut off and
bruises all over the body.
When the machine struck, the heavy
upright to the canopy top evidently
saved the occupants from greater in
jury if not death. Even though some
of the supports were broken off com
pletely while other were bent double,
they held up some of the weight of
the car.
Some in the machine at the time of
the accident said that something gave
way, evidently on one of the wheels.
The machine veered to the side of
the road, struck a stone or some oth
er projection and started up the bank,
turning over and landing bottom up,
the hood of the machine facing the
direction frora which they had been
coming. The machine was a com
plete wreck. The hind wheel on the
right hand side, which is thought to
have caused the trouble, was stripped
to the hub, every spoke being broken
off close.
Men from Wright's garage were
over two hours getting theheavy truck
in shape to bring it to the repair
shop.
Many people went to the scene of
the accident and the roadway was lin
ed with autos filled with people who
were travelling to and from the place,
WITH VERMONT TROOPS
Private Leonard Tells of Daily Life
At the Front Plenty of Sand,
Snakes and Lizards.
Eagle Pass, Texas, 7-3-'16.
, Dear Friend: I thought I would
write you a few lines to let you know
that I have received your most wel
come card and was glad to hear from
you. Arthur and I are very well and
happy at the present time.
Now I am going to tell you a little
of soldier life on the border in Texas.
We don't have much news here as
you know it is the same thing over
every day. We get up at 5.45 a. m.
and after reveille we have 10 minutes'
exercise, breakfast at 6.30 a. m. and
at 7.15, drill till 10.30 a. m. Then
we have nothing to do until 3.30 p.
m., when we drill until 4.30. We
have had one night drill.
About our trip, we left home, or
Essex Junction and it took exactly
five days and nights for the trip. We
were not allowed on the platform or
steps while the train was either going
or standing still. The girls were all
out at all the stations we stopped at
and were all anxious to obtain our
addresses so that they might write to
the brave soldiers like Arthur and I
are. We left the train each morn
ing for a 15 minute walk and that is
about all the exercise we got. We
arrived in uaiias, Texas, aoout 3 p
m., the last Saturday of our trip and
the girl3 there had prepared for us
with lemonade and cookies which
looked good to us, you bet.
But what got my goat was when
we landed here at 3 p. m. Sunday, the
warmest, time of the day, and we had
to put up our tents. I being a little
thirsty thought I would try 'some
Texas water so I went down to the
pipe (they have them arranged here
the same as at Fort Ethan Allen only
they are on top of the ground) to get
a drink. The water, having been in
the sun all day was boiling hot and
that made me mad, for I could have
licked all the Mexicans there is in
Mexico. Then about 7 p. m. we had
ouj tents nearly all up when up came
a big sand storm and covered every
thing with dust and dirt. Every lad I
bet, said to himself at that time, St.
Johnsbury couldn't have been (as
sometime you have heard state), the
last place God made, for this had it
beaten a mile.
We were allowed to go to the Big
City of Eagle Pass the next day and
after seeing it such a pleasant place
with movies and nice modern stores
we all felt much betters" The city is
about one mile from our camp. We
are not allowed out after retreat,
which is held at 6 p. m., although
there is no danger of any call. They
have each man armed with 210
rounds of ammunition. -
We don't hear one twenty-fifth as
much war news as you do in Ver
mont for everything seems to run
along smoothly as would a muster at
Burlington. The troops have been
streaming Into camp here every day.
We now have troops here from Mary
land, Kansas, Vermont, also 30th and
3rd Infantry, 14th Cavalry, a machine
gun troop. We have nice cool nights
and hot days but the country is very
healthful and you never hear of any
one sustaining a sunstroke. Unlike
Vermont they have very little rain
here until we came and we have had
two rains here this week. It sure
does takes the Vermont boys to bring
rain because we have proved it.
TJiere vis plenty of lizards, big
black spiders and rattlesnakes here.
One of our boys killed two of the lat
ter last week.
I drift back again to our rainstorm.
It started to rain a little and then it
rained in good shape, the land being
so dry it would not soak in at all and
it washed mud in large quantltis
down through the company street
and also into tents, getting everything
that was in the tents wet. In Ver
mont it would soak in a little but here
it all ran off and carried everything
with it.
Someone ju;st said that there were
7,000 militiamen and 6,000 .regulars
here at the present time. We are at
the present time doing guard duty,
guarding bridges, and that is no pleas
ant job for it is a dangerous one.
Well, I think I have written all the
news that I know of for now, hoping
to hear from you soon.
Your truly,
PVT. A. F. LEONARD,
Co. D, First Vermont Inf. Eagle Pass,

IAN DROWNED
AT JOE'S POND
Gerald Dunn Loses Life Saturday
In Attempt To Swim From Row-
boat to Shore, a Distance
About 200 Feet
ON OUTING WITH WIFE
In Company With Mr. and Mrs
George Eastman Decided to Go In
Swimming When About a Third of
Way Across to the Large Island
Body Recovered Sunday.
Gerald Dunn of St. Johnsbury was
drowned at Joe's Pond Saturday morn
ing when he attempted to swim
ashore, a distance of 200 or 300 feet,
fromhe boat in which he and a party
were out rowing.
Mr. and Mrs. Dunn went to Je's
Pond early Saturday morning for a
day's outing in company with Mr. and
Mrs. George Eastman and about 11
o'clock the party hired a boat and
after rowing near the shore for a
few minutes the women who were
rowing headed the boat for the large
island. Whe nabout a third of the
distance across, Mr. Dunn, who could
swim a little took off his clothing
with the exception of his union suit
and let himself over the side of the
boat into the water at the stern. He
held onto the back" of the boat for
some distance, allowing himself to be
towed along. When about two hun
dred or more feet from shore Mr.
Dunn expressed his intention of try
ing to swim the remaining distance,
and let go his hold on the boat.
They went ahead of him for some dis
tance and he seemed to be swimming
along all right. When they heard
him call out they supposed he was
fooling, as he had been a time pre
vious, so did not turn around. When
he disappeared under the surface
they started back as quickly as pos
sible, but he went under for the last
time before they reached him.
Men on the shore hurried to their
assistance but could not locate the
spot where he went down, near
enough to be of any help. Fred Bru
nelle, who was working on a cottage
at the Island, was one of the first to
arrive. He dove for the body two ot
three times but could not find it.
Men from the cottages on the lake
shore put out in boats and with town
authorities grappled for the body un
til late in the night. The body was
not found until 3 o'clock Sunday aft
ernoon, when a brother of the drown
ed man and a Mr. Rock of Waterford
drew it to the surface on grapples.
The body when found was about 150
feet from the island and in about 25
feet of water. The remains were tak
en to Stanley's undertaking rooms
until further arrangements could be
made.
Mr. Dunn resided in Fairbanks vil
lage, where he moved some time ago
from Portland street.

Pinks, played a three-inning game
which was won after a close finish by
