All of the talk about fusion appears
to center on a desire of the central

ALL CONCERNS SAY
THEY WILL COMPLY
Provisions Prescribe Hiring
Children Under 14 and Fix

Pineapple canners say that the
child labor law will have little ef
fect on that industry in the islands.
The law povides against the employ
ment in ' canneries of , children n under
14 years of age and for more than
eight hours six days in the week of
children between the ages of 14 and
16. One of the penalties is the clos
ing of Interstate commerce to goods
manufactured - in contravention
of
such law.
When pineapple cannery officials
were interviewed relative to the ef-
feet of the child labor law on the
personnel of their employes they
said the effect would be very small
William i. Gifford, manager of the
Hawaiian Preserving Company, says
his. concern hires no children under
14 years of age and very few under
16. The latter could be eliminated
easily, he says, lf such a law goes
into effect. '
F. W. Ma'cfarlane, president of ,LIb
by McNeill & Libby and of the
Pineapple Canners Association, de
clared, like G if ford, that no children
under 14 years were , employed and
said that those under 16 worked only
eight hours.
According to Gifford, everyone
