Views of Lemberg, Prize Again in Grasp of Russians!
Brotherhoods Accept Prof
fer Made by That Or
ganization.
(By Associated Press)
NEW YORK. Aug. 9.?The
threatened atrlke of 400,000 rail*
ro*d employee! of the United
States was averted today when
the railroad brotherhoods ac
cepted a proffer of the United
States Board of mediation and
Conciliation to mediate their dif
ferences with the railroad.
(By Associated Press.)
NEW YORK, Aug. 9?The national
conference of railroad managers today
agaiu rejected the demands ol. the
four railroad brotherhoods for an
eight-hour day and time and a half
tor overtime and proposed submis
sion of differences with the men to the
Federal Board of Mediation and Con
ciliation.
This proposal A. B. Garretson on be
half of the brotherhood rejected Ellsha
Lee, chairman of railroad conference
in proposing that the differences medi
ated called attention to the fact that
the brotherhood had previously de
clined arbitration under the Xewlands
act, providing for six arbitrators aiid
the railroad saw no other way out of
the difficulty than through medlaiion.
Mr. Garretson reiterating the conten
tion of brotherhoods that in previous
attemps to settle differences with rail
road through the Federal Board th*;
brotherhoods bad failed to-obtain sat
isfactory awards, said the union, be
lieved they could reach a settlement
by'dealing directly with the railroad.
M1 believe," he said, "settlement or
difference can be much better obtain
ed by dealing directly with you with
out interference with a third party."
Chairman Lee said that he would
nevertheless appeal to the board of
mediation and conciliation.
Judge W. Chambers, chairman ol
the United States Board of Mediation
and Conciliation,' announced after the
adjournment of the meeting that the
, railroads had formally appealed to the
I board to mediate their differences with
the union.
The board immediately prepared a
communication to the brotherhood of
fering its service which it was an
nounced would be dispatched to broth
erhood chiefs at once.
Meantime it was intimated the
board would remain in session in a
i nearby hotel to await the brother
hood's reply.
It was indicated by members of the
board that the communication was
being sent on the assumption that the
brotherhood would accept their offer.

COOPERATIVE
Sin II10
0E OPENED H
! !
Promoters Have Charter
For Ten Thousand Dol
lar Corporation.
The Fairmont Co-operative associa
tion, a unique venture in the Fair
mont business field announced today ,
i that their new store will be ready for
| business by September first. This
;new association is the first attempt i
'to operate true co-operative "owned-;
I by-the-consumers" store in this city.
Such stores in which the customers
share in the profits of the business
are now being successfully operated
in Grafton. Star City and many other
nearby cities.
The local association recently in.
corporated for *10,000. and their char,
ter specifies that the stock shall be
issued in $10 shares and not more
than five shares to any one person.
Thus if each subscriber to the stock
buys the limit there will be at least
200 stockholders. The total number,
however, will likely reach almost
twice as many. Although but recently
begun, by the local incorporators who
are promoting the association. 52.400
worth of the stock has alreadv been
subscribed and at the meetings* which
are held in the W. C. T. t*. hall more
subscribers are Joining each day.
The directors of the new association
are all well known men of the city
who having large families are alarmed
by th^ high-price of foodstuffs that is
noticeable this summer. Following
are the names of the men: W. M.
Rogers. W*. H. Snider. Arthur Finley,
Victor Walker, J. H. Nye. Watson Lee.
W. C. Smith, George Gross.
The plan of the new organization is
simple and, since their charter gives
| them the privilige to sell at both
[ wholesale and retail, it is possible for
owners of restaurants and boarding
' houses as well as individual families to
become members and stockholders, j
Groceries, meats and foodstuffs of all
hinds will be the sort of merchandise
sold at the store when it is opened,
although later the stockholders may
decide to carry other lines. A fea
ture of the plan is to make the store
a market for the farmer and especial
ly the truck grower. This will do
away with the useless duplication of
routes no*- practiced by truck grow
ers who attempt to sell their produce
direct to thfe consumer. . in this man
ner and by paj-irig the farmer prompt
ly the best price for his products, it
is thought that the present almost pro
hibitive price of vegetables and green
goods win be materially lessened. Such
a store with a dependable demand
for garden products will tend to en
courage truck farming in this coun
ty and thus the directors of the asso
ciation believe that much good will
result.
The location of the store has not
yet be*n selected, but will be at some
convenient point near the center of
the city. The local association has se
cured an experienced organizer of
co-operative store? who will address
the stockholders at a meeting to be
held in Willard hall Sunday evening,
August 13. All interested persons will
be present at this meeting and the de.
tails of the plan .will be thorough It
discussed. The name of the speaker
nas not been learned but will be an
nounced Saturday.

FEE SYSTEM ENDS SOON
All County Officers on Sal
ary After First of Next
January.
The lowered state tax, which has
been reduced from 14 cents from this
county to 10 cents, will cause Mar
ion county's total tax bill for the
present fiscal year io be considerably
lessened. The scnool and road tax
are practically the same throughout
the county this year as last year. The
county court today stated that the
county tax in Fairmont had been re
duced two cents in consideration of
the added five cents that the Fairmont
city officials had laid.
Although considerable added ex
pense will be placed upon the coun
tv fund during the' present fiscal year,
because of the fact that the fees from
the sheriff and clerks will cease Janu
ary first and these officials will un
der the new law be placed on the sal
ary list of the county, yet the court
did not raise the levy as a balance
of about J21,000 was on hand at the
beginning of this year which is
thought sufficient to carry the added
expense until July 1, 1917.
The total sum in Marion county
from which taxes are collected is
S133.127.085.2S as stated in The West
Virginian yesterday, but this is not
the total valuation of the property in
the county which is only $6,563,567.64.
This paradoxical condition arises
from the fact that some of the 66 odd
million are taxed two and three times
thus bringing the total that is taxable
to 133 million odd.
The complete report of all the tax
levy in Marion county which was
made yesterday by the county court
and the boards of education together
with the various municipal govern
ments in the county is being prepar
ed for publication and will likely be
ready in a few days.
The most noticeable feature of this
report will be the fact that the tax
for school purposes in this county is
more than the added taxes for all oth
er purposes.
