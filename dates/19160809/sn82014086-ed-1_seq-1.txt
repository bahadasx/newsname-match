Has Not Reported from Flight.
Philadelphia, Aug. 8. A cable from
Paris to the Philadelphia Bulletin and
Chicago Daily News says that Norman
Prince, the American aviator with the
Franco -American flying corps, who left
on a flight, is reported missing.
Norman Prince has won special
praise from France for his coolness and
daring in the war. Flying with Hall,
Rockwell, Cowdin and other Ameri
cans, including also Chapman, who re
cently was killed in a light with the
Germans, Prince only a short time
ago took the sir again after having
been wounded in an aviation engage
ment. Prince was graduated from Harvard
in 1909. He made himself known as a
horseman and polo player. With the
outbreak of the war he gave up his
law practice to Join the cause of the
allies. In May, 1915, he was commis
sioned an aviator at Pau. He is the
son of Frederick H. Prince, head of a
big banking and brokerage house. He
is now about 2S 3'ears old. After leav
ing college he entered the Harvard
Law school and was graduated from
that institution in 1912.
Inquiry at the Boston office of F. H.
Prince & company ascertained the in
formation that only the briefest re
port had been received as to Norman
Prince. "We had a report from Chi
cago and one from Philadelphia that he
is missing," said F. Addison Taylor of
the company, "but nothing further, and
I presume it is the same desaptch as
the one you have received. We, of
course, do not know whether it is
true."

GETTING IN TOUCH WITH

Washington, Aug. S. Judge William
L. Chambers and G. W. V. Hanger,
members of the United States board of
mediation and conciliation, arranged

FIVE CENT LOAF OF
EREAD AN ECONOMIC WASTE.
Sitine Amount of Flour Used Cheaper
in Ten Cent Loaves.
Salt Lake City, Utah, Aug. S. .A
five cent loaf of Dread is an economic
waste, in the opinion of C. N. Power
of Pueblo, Col., who today addressed
the convention here ef the Master
Bakers of the T'nited States. He dis
cussed the Ten Cent Loaf, and Why.
Efficiency, declared Mr. Power, de
manded the baking of ten cent loaves
rather than the five cent sixe. He es
timated the ccst of baking one thou
sand loaves of bread of the five cent
size is S3. 55 more than the cost of
baking the same flour into 500 ten
cent loaves.
"The overhead charge cannot be
justified." continued Mr. Power. "A
baker should regard himself as an
agent of the people who use bread,
with the sacr-i-d responsibility of pro
viding them with the most digestive
and nutritious bread it is possible to
make. This cannot be accomplished
with a five cent loaf."

to the constitution than the passage

"There has not been a single im
portant measure passed since 1913 in
which Democratic congressmen have
not felt the heavy hand of the execu
tive," said the senator
