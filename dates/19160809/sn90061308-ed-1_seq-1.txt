successes
In Austria the Italians have cap
tured the city of Gorizia, 22 miles
northwest of Triest; .in Galicia the
Russians, in quest of Lemberg, have
further carried out their endeavors
toward the capture of Stanislau from
the Austro-Germans, while in France
the French and British troops in the
Somme region have attacked and won
additional points of vantage from the
Germans.
In the , fall of Gorizia, in which
Rome says the Austrians were com
pletely routed, the Italians inflicted
heavy casualties on its defenders, took
more than 100,000 men prisoners and
captured considerable quantities of
war requisites.
The Russian general, Letchitzky,
has driven his wedge further into the
Austro-German line near Stanislau,
capturing eight miles of that im
portant city through which the rail
road leads to Lemberg and the town
of Tysmienitsa. Northeast of Tys
mienitsa the Russians have crossed to
the right bank of the Koropice river
and captured a number of important
positions. .
Berlin admits the retirement of the
Austro-Germans behind the Niznioff-Tyscienitsa-Ottyma
line, but says that
in the Carpathian region heights held
by the Russians near Jabionitsa and
Vorocht were captured and that
. strong Russian attacks in the Delatyn
district were repulsed.

What shall we give as our truest gift
To the heart that's bowed in sorrow
It is easy to pay ,
And go on your way
And leave it to struggle as best
' it may,
Forgetting 'tis ours that burden to lift,
That the need is for love which is
God's best gift!
If it's true that we each to the other
owe .
The help of a loving.brother,
What shall we give ?
Just the means to live?
Give nothing more just the
means to live ? (
Shall we fling him some gold just to
heal his woe, -Then
quickly forget the true debt we
owe?
There is but one gift one true gift to
make
To solace our brother's pain.
Each must give of himself;
Not his gold mere pelf
But the gold of his heart his own
innermost self,
With loving hand striving to soothe
the ache
With the gift of himself that's the
gift to make
Let's help the idle to find his work!
Let's the help the 'hungry to earn
his meal !
Let's teach each one
That a task well done
Brings all the joy that is under

MYSTERY OF THE MAN'S
HAND PROBABLY SOLVED
Decomposed Body , of Man Foundin
' Hay Field .Near Railroad Track
Identified as Remains of Will
Abbott of Peirce City.
The mystery of the man's hand
found in Sanford Wormington's barn
the morning of July 18 has probably
been solved in the finding of the de
composed body of a man in a hay field
near town Wednesday afternoon. The
body has been identified as ' that of
Will Abbott of Peirce City, a plasterer
who often walked from Peirce City
to Monett on the railroad track, . i
Joe Grovnile of Monett, who owns
the house Occupied by W. Dehanas'
second hand store, was walking
through the fields Wednesday after
noon along the ditch which parallels
the railroad track west of town.. In
J. II. Wormington's hay field, between
the ditch and the track; he was at
tracted by an offensive odor and ' on
looking around saw lying in the weeds
the remains of a man long dead. The
body had decomposed and nothing but
the skeleton and hair were left. An
imals had carried off parts of jthe legs
and arms.
Mr. Grovnile immediately reported
his find. Coroner Jim King empan
eled a jury, consisting of J. W. Jones,
C. L. Henson, Spencer Pannell, A. E.
Spratley, James W. Wells and Ben L.
Amber. These men, with the mayor,
W. J. Fleming, City Marshal Smerdon
and the coroner, went down and viewed
the remains. Mr. Smerdon voiced his
belief that the body was that of Will
Abbott of Peirce City, who he knew
had been missing: for some time and
for whom inquiry had been madeT .
Mr. Smerdon's surmise was found to
be correct. The clothing was the
same as that seen on Will Abbott the
last time he was in Monett. This
was, as near as can be found out, on
Sunday, July 9 when the man was seen
by Mark Tiernan, the watchman at
the crossing in the west part of town.
He was going down the track toward
Peirce City. He had with him a bot
tle of whiskey - wrapped in a news-?
paper, and he dropped it near the
I watchman's office and , picked it up
again. He was intoxicated at, the
time.1'"' " '" " , -:
It Isn't Too Early
Beautiful Patterns now on Display. Let us make your fall
GALLOWAY & MANSFIELD
Fall Suit.
Other identification was made by
Dr. Q. O. Hudson, the dentist, who
recognized a gold tooth in the man's
mouth as his work for Will Abbott.!
In his clothing Was thirty-five cents
in change and a bunch of keys. Be
side the -body , was a whiskey bottle.
The keys were taken to Peirce City
and fitted the locks to the floors lead
ing to Abbot's room. He lived in a
room up stairs over the Peirce City
Journal office. Yale locks had been
put on the doors by Ot Helweg, who
had charge -of the property and one
key fitted the door at the foot of the
stairs and the other the door into his
room.
There is no daubt that the body is
that of Will Abbott. He had been
drinking a great deal for. the past
two years. In the spring he had an
attack of delirium tremens and was
told by a physician that another at
tack would kill him . Before the
Fourth of July he had been on another
protracted spree "and the morning of
July 4 is the last time Peirce City
citizens remember seeing him;'
He probably came to Monett, se
cured a quantity of liquor and on his
way home down ,the, tracks had an
other had attack and crawled into the
field, where he died. He was lying
face upward when found. Though
some believe he may have been struck
by a train and mortally wounded,
others believe that he could not have
crawled the .distance had he been se
riously hurt. It is the general belief
that he died as the result of a pro
tracted' spree. Whether or not the
hand found by Mr. Wormington was
that of Will Abbott will never be
known, but it is possible that it could
have been his as the hand when found
had been off for a week' or ten days
and was black. It was ten days from
the last time Will Abbot was seen by
Mr. Tiernan until the hand was found
The hairsH on the hand were red and
Abbot was of light or medium com
plexion. Will Abbot was 42 years old. He
was not always the drunken unfortun
ate of his last years. In his youth
he had every promise of clean and
honorable manhood. He was a regu
lar attendant at church and Sunday
school. He was a musician and played
atr4nsto)mp.r.tln-4"' 'hiirrh choir.
He had a good education and was
especially bright in history for which
he had a remarkable memory. He
went in good society and was counted
one of the best young men in Peirce
City.. .
- He began to drink and go in bad
.company and went from bad to worse
until he became a poor miserable sot.
He felt his fallen condition at times
and even threatened to make an end
of it, but nothing in his terrible death
points to suicide.
His parents are both dead.
The mother died first and hs father
died about four years ago of cancer.
He was a plasterer by trade and was
a good workman. He had small
amounts of money in the two Peirce
City banks and in the bank at Went-
worth. He was in the habit of check
! ing out small sums as he needed mon
ey and his failure to do so for the
past six weeks had led to inquiry as
to his whereabouts, but no trace could
be found until, the terrible discovery
i of yesterday.

the services of the federal mediation
board had been accepted today in the
threatened strike 400,000 railroads
was received with undisguised relief
by administration officials here.
The members of the board with
Secretary Wilson, went to New York
with directions from President Wilson
to do everything possible to avert a
strike. They were instructed to keep
the White House fully informed of
every development.'
j New York, Aug. 9. If the United

; iation, which was called in today,
fails to adjust the differences between
i the railroads of the country and their
1 400.000 employes, President Wilson
! will be asked to use his personal ih
i fluence to avert a general strike,
j This statement was made today by
' a representative of the railroad mana
: gers, who have been negotiating with
; the men since June 1 for a peaceful
settlement.
! The appeal to the president will be
, the last resort and should be taken
only to save the nation from the trade
paralysis that would follow the strike
