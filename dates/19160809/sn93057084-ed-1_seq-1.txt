FOR PROHIBITION-VOTE Y3S
An organization has sprung up
in South Dakota with headquarters
Pt. W atertown having fur its ob
ject the defeat of the Prohibition
amendment to the constitution of
the South Dakota which is to be
voted on at the fall election, and
is sending out considerable adver
tising matter to the newspapers of
the state. The Press is first, last
flud all the time for the proposed
amendment. If certain people
would drink their drinks without
i-ecomino- drunk, and making
themselves a general nuisance to
the man who tries to square his
life with moral standards, The
Press might possibly be induced to
support the cause of local option,
which the new organization is in
fayor of in other words they want
to leave the prohibition question
where it is now.
The Press believes that intox
ieating liquors area poison, from
start to finish, to the man who
drinks temperately as well as the
man who ends up his earthly car
eer with delirium tremens, or who
gets so inflamed from its use that
he wants to "paint the town red,"
or who has no regard for those
who want to see the local option
as well as other prohibition laws
enforced.
The policy of appealing from
"Philip drunk'' to "Philip sober"
may be fun. or a matter of prin
ciple, with some people but hun
dreds of people believe that no
nation can exist "half drunk and
half sober,'" ns was said of slavery.
The "goody goody'" man, so
called, has the same right to inject
his moral principles into politics
as the other man has to put, his
views into politics.
People nowadays being general
ly able to read, we cannot see how
a voter can decide the right or
wrong of the Prohibition Amend
ment from a few weeks campaign
of "advertising matter" that is
very apt to be one sided.'
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS MUST
SET EXAMPLE
Much of South Dakota is located
either adjoining or near an Indian
reservation. For nearly one hun
dred years it has been the policy
of this government, as expressed
by the enactments of Congress and
decisions of the Supreme court.
that it was a misdemeanor to give
an Indian intoxicated liquor. The
States of the South, except two,
seem to have come to the same
conclusion in regard to the negro,
having enacted Prohibition laws.
Is the Caucasian race so wise and
superior that it can say to the Ind
ian and the negro "You cannot
touch—you have no right to—our
wine, gin and brandies?" That is
the question that is involved in
Licence or No-License, which is
equivalent to "Prohibition in
spots."
United States Indian Commiss
ioner Sells it seems is enforcing
this principle of moral law on the
Indian reservations, as expressed
in ..the following quotation from
one of our exchanges:
"If liquor is bad for the Indian
it is also bad for the employees of
the Indian service.
"That is what Cato Sells, United
States Indian Commissioner, of
Washington, D,C.« pointed out in
an address to the 220 superifftend
ents teachers and Indian service
employees at the United States In
dustrial School.
"Mt Sells called attention to the
increase of §50,000 in the Indian
appropriation this year and said
that be intends to wage a vigorous
PORE
ST
&
tight on the illicit sale of liquor to
Indians.
"At the same time he warned
the employees of the Indian ser
vice that he would not tolerate
their use of alcoholics, and said
that if he found any of them drink
ing and keeping liquor near them
hp would have them discharged
from the service.*'
Potter County is located on the
border of the Cheyenne River Ind
ian reservation. Are the people
of this county going to set up in
the liquor business, while the rest
of America says that over the line
it has got to be Prohibition that
the Indian has not got the same
right to drink and get drunk as
the white man has?

BRIQUETTINO
PLANT
Contract let for Plant on Missouri
River
Charles A. Johnson of Fairfax,
president of the .Johnson Fuel
company has contracted for the
erection of a six unit Fernholz
Briquetting plant to be located on
the bank of the Missouri near Bis
mark. The matter of securing
coal in South and North Dakota to
solve the fuel problem expense in
these two states has been before
the people lately, and the result is
this enterprise, which begins first
in North Dakota.
The sentiment is now expressed
that since the company chose
North Dakota for the location
there is the more reason why the
state of South Dakota should give
state aid to a similar enterprise in
this state, when the amendment to
be voted upon this fall passes, as
is expected, permitting state aid
to internal improvement.
The Johnson plant will be in
operation by November 1, and will
have a capacity of 450 tons daily,
or 15 car loads. In the spring the
company will begin supplying the
Missouri river towns with coal via
river. Johnson himself has had
years of river experience, prior to
the building of the railroad to
Fairfax having shipped grain and
livestock in Gregory county to
market by boat.
