A number of people have
agreed to contribute books and
periodicals and some have
agreed to contribute chairs and
tables. Mrs. Benedict's idea is
to have the room as a rest room
for the women and children
who come in from the country
to shop, as a meeting place for
the Lbngiie and the organi/.a
tions of women who care to use
it, and as a library. After full
discussion, it was moved and
seconded that the League lend
Mrs. Benedict all possible aid in
the attempt to establish the
libary and club room and that
wo each do everything in our
power to aitl her. Mrs. Benedict
will invite the other organiza
tions of women to join tier in
the work and will try to secure
further contributions toward
the rent and lip-keep of the
room.
Mr. Uobo, the mnyor, has
agreed that the night police?
man will see to tho closing of
the library nt tho proper hour
at night and to its opening in j

journed until Saturday after

Author John Fox Is Writing
A New Hook.
The Kooxville Journal and
Tribune has the following to
say of .lohn Pox, Jr., of Big,
Stone (lap, the well-known Vir?
ginia author:
" Yes, I'm husy on a new nov?
el now and also have a number
of short stories in the making",
said John Pox, Jr., of Big
Stone (lap, Va., the author of
"The Little Shepherd of King?
dom Come", who has been in
Knnxvillo the past three days
as a participant of the invita?
tion golf tournament nl the
Cherokee links,
Mr. Kox waa quite an inter?
esting character on the links.
All knew him by reputation
and many knew him personal?
ly. The gentlemen and the
golf players were attracted to
him on account of his playing
and the ladies wanted to see the
"former husband of Kril/.i
Schelf" tho famous actress,
now married agnin.
This was the author's first
visit to a southern tournament.
"I am Unding it very interest?
ing indeed" he told his new ac?
quaintances here.
Mr. Pox was on the loenl
links about three years ago but
no matches were on tit that
tune.
Members of the local club
found him very pleasant, lie
played ti good game of golf and
gave his opponent a run for his
money in qualifying for the
soini-iliials.
DU'the links he is an inter?
esting conversationalist, but on
the links ho goes after the game
for till it is worth. In the final
championship watch butwonn
Jones und I lean ho fallowed
the gallery with a good deal of
interest and enthusiasm. In
this ho saw every thing ho came
to East Tennessee for?tho real
inside of a southern golf tour?
nament.
In tho hook ho is now pre
paring at his mountain home
at Big Stone Unp, Mr. Pox is
writing of a different time und
taking a different scenp from
all Iiis former efforts. His
great stories are all laid in the
mountains of Kentucky, Past
Tennessee and Virginia und his
subjects have been lite moun?
tain people with whom he is
well acquainted.
The scene of his now story is
laid along the James river and
is n contrast between the peo?
ple of that section nnd the peo?
ple of tho mountains.
"I haven't selected the name
yet," ho said in reply to the
question as to v/hat no would
cnll the latest cITort. "Of
course, I have a number of
names in mind, but I haven't,
decided just which ono I will
use."
Mr. Pox explained that ho
was also preparing some short
stories which ho will release at
an early date.
Infantile Paralysis.
Two.deaths occured in M id
dlesboro this week from infan?
tile paralysis. Tho origin of
the disease is not known, and it
ia feared that the disease may
become opidemic. Every pro
! caution is being taken by the
physicians of that city, and no
new cases have been reported.

Mayor Rose Denies News?
paper Report.
The news item going tho
rounds to tho effect tlmt this
town is sneing the V. it S. W.
Railway for $3,600.00 for viola?
tions of the "Period of Service
Law" is untrue. This town
and tho V. & S. IV. are having
no difficulties whatever.
If there is anything in tho
report, it possibly arose out of
some aetiou instituted in tho
l'. s. Court here, as that Court
would have jurisdiction in eases
arising under the law mention?

Mayor of Hig Stone Gap.
Coal And Iron Men In Con?
ference Here.
Several prominent men ident?
ified with the Clinchfield Cor?
poration and other mining con?
cerns in Southwest Virginia,
met here Tuesday for a confer?
ence, and spent the afternoon
together at Hotel Bristol. They
were discussing matters of im?
portance to the eoal trade and
to development in Virginia ter?
ritory. '
Among those participating in
the conference were: t'. K.
BrocktlB, of New York, J. M.
Burr, of Norfolk, for many
years prominently identified
with mining and railroad inter?
ests in the south, lion. It, T?te
Irvine, prominent as a lawyer,
eoke and iron manufacturer in
Wise COlltlty, Charles \V. Boh
durnnt, prominent as an opera?
tor in the Black Mountain ills*
trict, .James U. McDowell, of
KllOXvillo, for many years
prominent as a railroad con?
tractor, O. II. Thompson, oper?
ator at Darby, Va., SV. It.
Wagner, and Q. A. Boose, the
last mentioned of Spartauhilrg,
s. c.
Mr. Irvine was in good spirits
concerning the prospects for
the manufacture of iron nl Big
Stone I lap. lie said that a force
of mechanics was busy making
the necessary repairs. When
asked us to when the (lap fur
nace would go into blaHt, ho
said with a merry twinkle in
bis eyes; "If not earlier, then
certainly tho morning following
the reelection of Wooiirow Wil?
son aw president of the United
Slates."
There were those in the party
who seemed inclined to dilfor
from him, ami one of them de?
clared that if Mr. Irvine was
going to base operations upon
the reelection of Mr. Wilson,
ho wouldn't get started in No?
vember.
Regardless of this disagree?
ment, all were agreed that
America is jUBt now enjoying
a gratifying wave of prosperity.

EVER SALIVATED BY
CALOMEL? HORRIBLE!
Calomel is Quicksilver and
Acts Like Dynamite On
Your Liver.
Calomel loseH you a day! You
know what calomel is. It's
mercury; quicksilver. Calomel
is dangerous. It crashes into
sour bile like dynamite, cramp?
ing and sickening you. Calomel
attacks the bones and should
never bo put into your system.
When you feel bilious, slug?
gish, constipated ami all knock?
ed out and beliovo you need n
dose of dangerous calomel just
remember that your druggist
sells for 50 cents a large bottle
of Dodson's Liver Tone, which
is entirely vegetable and pleas?
ant to take and is a perfect sub?
stitute for calomel. It is guar?
anteed to start your liver with,
out stirring you up inside, and
can not salivate.
Don't take calomel! It makes
you sick tho next day; it loses
you n day's work. Dodson's
Liver Tone Btraightons you
right up and you feel great.
Give it to the children because
it is perfectly harmless and
doesn't gripe,?adv.
