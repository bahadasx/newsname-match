Mr. Hughes cited the retirement of
K 1 '.ma l'?urand as Director of the
Census and the appointment of Wll
liam J. Harris in his place, and the
replacement of o. H Tlttman. as head
of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, by
II'r. K. I.ester Jones. Mr. Redfleld's
telegram to Secretary Tumulty follows:
"Statement of Hughes respecting ap
v pointmenlM false as to facts and of
misleading substance You may say
from me. Durund, of census, retired
'voluntarily, wan not removed or re
tired. 1 recommended him to present
employment. Harris succession was
not political. Made fine record, and
promoted trade commissioner for merit.
Tittman, Coast Survey, retired volun
tarily. after my refusing one resigna
tion Jones, his successor, promoted
i r meritorious work as deputy com
missioner fisheries Has made Hun
derful record instilling new life into
se rv ice."
Mr. Sweet's telegram to Mr. Hughes
follows:
"In a speech at Detroit yesterday
you are quoted as saying:
" 'We had in the Coast and Geodetic
Survey an eminent scientist, a man
who had won distinction in connection
with his scientific work, a man of
eminent rank. He was displaced to
make room for an excellent stock
breeder and veterinary surgeon.
"'In the Coast and Geodetic Survey
we have had a very extraordinary con
dition with regard to expert places. I
mean places that were taken out of
the civil service laws. I shall not go
into exact figures. In the year ending
about April, 1916, there were taken out
V'l?that If. appointments hv the
executive, removed from the operation
of the civil service laws to the number.
I believe, of about 104. I believe that
some twenty of those were made with
out seeking the advice of the Civil Ser
vice Commission; I believe that there
were about twenty-three after seeking
the advice and with the approval of the
[ Civil Servlco Commission, and I believe
that sixty-two were made In opposition
of the advice of the Civil Service Com
mission.'
FEKIjS IT HIS Dl'TY
TO COIIIIECT (JHAVK KHHOHS
"In the absence of the Secretary of
Commerce (one of the bureaus to which
the Coast and Geodetic Survey be
longs), I deem it my duty to correct
some grave errors in the foregoing
statement.
"Dr. Tittman. .superintendent of the
Coast and Geodetic Survey, the scient
ist to whom you refer, was not dis
placed. In February or March, 1915,
he came to my office and told me that
he bed determined to resign on account
of ill health. He said that he had
reached the conclusion many months
before, and had already purchased a
place In Leesburg. Va? which he ex
pected to make his home. I communi
cated this information to Secretary
Kedtleld, who expressed surprise and
regret. Dr. Tittman's action was
entirely voluntary, and was not the
result of any suggestion of the depart
ment, direct or indirect.
"You refer to K. Lester Jones, his
successor, as a stock breeder and vet
erinary surgeon. At one time he had
a farm in Yirginia, on which he raised
stock. This was sold some time heforo
be entered the government service. He
never was a veterinary surgeon. He
;s a gentleman of education and re
linement. Before his appointment to
succeed Dr. Tittman he was deputy
commissioner of fisheries (another bu
reau of this department) and displayed
administrative talent of such high
order that ho was deemed by both
the secretary and myself worthy of
recommendation to (ill the vacancy In
the Coast and Geodetic Survey. In our
judgment, this bureau was well
equipped from the scientific, standpoint,
but stood in great need of a man of
executive ability to direct and organ
ize. Its work.

LONDON, August S.?Before tho
echoes of tho mutual congratulations
of the entente allted sovereigns on tho
auspicious opening of the third year
of the war have died comes news of
further Russian successes and of a
splendid victory for the Italian arms
on the Isonzo front.
The surprising success of the Ital
ians. who in two days have captured
10,0.to prisoners, suggests that, in addi
tion to transferring- General Ivoevoss,
an aide Austrian general, from tho
Trcntino front to Galicia, the Aus
trians ventured to transfer troops from
the Isonzo to the Russian front in an
endeavor to stem tho Russian ad
vance.
General f'adorna's victory has caused
in London great rejoicing as one of tho
most promising successes in the new
allied operations and a demonstration
of t lie constantly growing power of
the allied offensive on all fronts.
Russia's new victories south of tho
Dniester and southwest of the Stanis
lau-Kolomea railway offered equal sat
isfaction. and the prompt admission in
the Berlin otlioial statement of the
retirement of the Austro-German force.i
south of the Dniester Is taken hero to
indicate that the Russian victory In
tins quarter is weightier titan yet an
nounced by the Russian official dis
patch. According to an unofficial re
port, the evacuation of Lent berg, tho
Galidnn capital, already has been
ordered.
In tho meantime, a new combined
offensive by the allies has begun on
the western front, which is expected
to load to the severest lighting. Guil
lemont. around which heavy fighting
is now in progress, is one of tho strong
positions in the Geinian second system
of defense, and doubtless ill be de
fended l>y the Germans. as was
I'o/.ieres, with tho utmost stubborn
ness.
