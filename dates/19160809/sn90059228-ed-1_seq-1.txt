BARREN'S CHAUTAUQUA
WAS A SUCCESS
Five Days of Mental and Spiritual
Uplift.Speakers with a Message.
Soul-stirring Music. Large At
tendance at every program.
The Warren Chautauqua for 1916
closed its five-day program on Mon
day evening this week. For five
consecutive days, beginning on
Thursday of last week, the people of
this community have been instructed
and entertained by some of the best
talent on the American lecture plat
form.
The opening program on Thursday
afternoon was given by the Savran
offs and Stewart I. Long and by the
Savranoffs and Fred J. Clark in the
evening. -The Savranoffs, a trio of
Eussian players, gave an entertain
ing and greatly appreciated program
of musical numbers, largely illustrat
ing Russian music and melodies.
Especially enjoyable were the songs
rendered by Mrs. Savranoff, and al
so her imitations on the piano, such
as a moving picture show piano
player and other stunts. The ad
dress by Mr. Long, on the subject,
"Reaching the Goal," was full of in
spirition and encouragement to the
struggling soul in the world of
strife. In vivid world pictures he
showed what a tremendous fight
against heavy odds many of the
best men in the world have had to
wage before achiving success. He
took issue with the thought ex
pressed in John J. Ingalls' poem on
^Opportunity, which is to the effect
that opportunity knocks but once at
the door, and if not grasped then is
lost forever. Far more cheerful and
hopeful are the sentiments expressed
in Malone's poem on Opportunity to
the effect that opportunity is con
stantly knocking at our door and
that it only remains for us to open
and let her in. No one has failed so
dismally in life but that he may
rise again and make a success. No
*one is too old %p mj&ey^Bew^^j&rt
in life and he cited numerous" in~
stances of men who had done their
best and greatest work in the even
ing of their lives. Golden oppor
tunities are found all about us all of
the time only we know how to em
brace them and make the most of
them.
Mr. Clark stirred up the assembly
with his lecture on several kinds of
fools and scored repeatedly with his
illustrations. He made a strong
point against the jingoes and advo-
cates of over preparedness who lived
in constant fear that the United
States was to be attacked by some
imaginary foe and who challenged
the patriotism of everybody else who
did not harbor their wild hallucina
tions. He said he favored a reason
able preparedness and claimed that
he was just as patriotic and as
ready to die for his country as were
those war crazed individuals who
from sordid motives or lack of com
mon sense were ready to plunge this
country into the tyranny of militar
ism. Other foolish things in Ameri
can social and political life were also
attacked. As Mr. Clark spoke the
heaviest rainfall of the season des
cended, the water pouring into the
tent in torrents and finally forcing
him to cut short his very interesting
address.
On Friday the Old Home Singers
furnished the musical number for the
tafternoon, while Yutaka Minakuchi,
st Japanese orator who is a natural
ized American citizen, delivered an
able and eloquent address on "The
East and the West and the Border-
land." Mr. Minakuchi discussed in
an entertaining and elucidating man
ner the American-Japanese question
in a sane and impartial light show
ing the unlikelyhood of there ever
being war between the two countries.
The United States is Japan's best
customer and Japan would never
think of fighting us. The United
States has done much to teach and
Christianize the Japanese people and
has assisted them in taking an ex
alted position among the nations of
S the globe. As long as the United
jf States adheres to its past policy of
being a leader for good will, peace,
justice, Christian principles and a
higher plane of civilization among
the nations, then there can be no
trouble between the two countries.
In the great borderland of the mind,
there is, or should be, no distinction
\s to race or color. The achieve
ments of each nation and its con
tribution to the advancement of the
^orld, should be duly recognized.
The speaker alluded to the fact
that there is in this country a ten
dency to depart from the policy of
the fathers and inaugurate a system
rot old world militarism, in opposition
V.
A
to all the teachings of brotherly love
and good will of the Master. In
eloquent words he portrayed and
advocated the parliament of nations
and the federation of the world.
Very impressive was his reference
to the stars in the American flag
and the sun flag of Japan. As the
sun and stars in the firmament
never quarrel, neither will the na
tions who have adopted these em
blems for their flags. In the light
of Christianity all peoples are of
one blood and have one common pur
pose.
On Friday evening the Old Home
Singers furnished the full entertain
ment, appearing in costumes of
1860, the ladies in hoopskirts, and
rendering a number of old time fa
vorite songs, that were well re
ceived.
On Saturday Chimera and his
great band entertained the assem
ly both afternoon and evening, by
high class soul stirring music. Ma
dame Cafarilli, a famous Chicago
opera singer, accompanied the band,
and rendered many selections to the
delight of all who heard her. Her
singing of the "Holy City" was fine
indeed.
On Sunday the Bohannans furnish
ed the musical treats. Dr. James L.
Gordon, of Winnipeg, Canada's
greatest preacher delivered a mas
terful address in the afternoon on
the subject "Grace, Grit and Green
backs." He is a whirlwind of a
speaker, with an unlimited fund of
good stories and apt poetical quota
tions on hand for immediate use in
driving home some useful and
wholesome facts. The address was
a beacon light to success and full of
inspiration, especially for all
and^ his message1
with great interest. The songs,
readings and impersonations of the
Bohannans on Sunday evening were
also much enjoyed.
Monday was the closing day when
Ducrot, the great magician, enter
tained in the afternoon both old
and young by his nimble perform
ances. The Chrisian Giles company
furnished the musical numbers.
They are splendid entertainers.
This company and Bingham, a nat
ural born humorist and merry maker
"broke up" the Chautauqua in a
revelry of wholesome fun. Every
body laughedcould not help doing
so.
During the afternoon on Monday
the children, under the direction of
Marguarite Schmitz, play
WHERE MARSHALL COUNTY
FOUND ITS NAME.
General William Rainy Marshall,
governor of Minnesota from 1866 to
1870, is honored in the name of this
county, established in 1879. Gover
nor Marshall was born in Missouri
in 1825, came to St. Anthony in 1849
and two years later moved to St
Paul where he was the first hard
ware merchant. He served in the
Sioux and civil wars and was state
railroad commissioner from 1876 to
1882. In 1893h was elected secre
tary of the Minnesota Historical so
ciety but ill health forced him to
resign the following year and he
died in California in 1896.
Lewis P. Dahlquist,4 county treas
urere of Roseau county, and family,
came in their automobile to visit
over Sunday'with Rev. and Mrs." P.
Dahlquist of this city, parents of
the former. They left for home on
Monday about noon.
Mr. McDonald is a rapid fire- talked ^d^ the most interesting of which "his* was* "\v^Emn ^nT-iS1*
was
specialist,
gave an interesting "dress up" pro
gram. At the opening of Monday's
program the Warren band furnished
a number of selections that were
well received.
This year's Chautauqua was a
great success. Even the attendance
was all that could be expected, con
sidering that the busy season has
arrived. The attractions, if any
thing have been stronger than at
any former Chautauqua. Our city
and our community cannot fail to
reap many benefits from such ga
therings, and we cannot afford to let
a year slip by without one. We
are also pleased to state that Mr.
Preston, who gracefully and tact
fully has superintended and man
aged this Chautauqua, has succeeded
in getting a contract signed by War
ren's business men for a Chautauqua
to be held next year.

Esteemed Young Lady Passes Away.
Miss Edith Emelia Olson, daugther
of Mr. and Mrs. Eric Olson, of town
of Foldahl, died on August 3, Id
of inflamation of the brain, after a
three weeks' illness, aged 15 years,
10 months and 5 days.
Deceased was born at FoldaM,
Sept 28, 1900. She grew up to be
a bright and promising vouir
woman, dearly beloved in her home,
and held in the highest esteem 'y a
large circle of friends. As she
budded into womanhood a long life
of service and happiness seemingly
opened up before. But God in his
mercy had decreed otherwise. On
the early wings of the morning on
the above mentioned day the im
mortal spirit of Edith Emelin was
carried away from the sorrows of
earth to the realms of eternal bliss.
She had attended the Argyle High
School two years and she was con
firmed on Aug. 4, 1912. Four years
later to the day, namely on Aug. 4,
1916, her funeral was held from the
same church, the Norwegian Luther
an church at Alma. The funeral
service was conducted by Rev.
Wahlund, assisted by Rev. A. Gil
seth. Many beautiful floral tributes
attested the love entertained for her
by those with whom her brief life
had come in contact. Her High
School class and the Young Peoples
Society contributed artistically
designed set pieces.
Although firm in the conviction
that the departed daughter and sis
ter has only gone before to the bet
ter 'land, yet in the family circle
whetfe she was the center of love
and1
attention, there is an empty
space, and in hearts of those who
were near and dear to her there is
an aching void that time only can
heal. To all who mourn the com
munity extends most heartfelt
sympathy.
Blessing of Diversified Farming.
It has come to be accepted that
the wheat crop of Minnesota and the
Dakotas, as a whole, will be relative
ly light in quantity and low
grade. Weather conditions of ~the
pas4r*three weeks have been so un
orable that the wheat, speaking
generally, was damaged beyond the
possibility of repair by the rains of
the week end.
In such a crop emergency the dis
position is to minimize the damage
until the threshing machines have
told the exact truth, so it is fair to
assume that all of the current re
ports have done the situation no in
justice.
With the prospect of a reduced
wheat crop before us, it is interest
ing and gratifying to observe that
there is not an intimation of an un
favorable effect upon the genera1
business outlook of the Northwest.
Why? In a word, because the
Northwest no longer is a one-crop
section. The time was when a faji
ure of the wheat crop spelled dis
aster when, if the farmer marketed
no wheat, he had nothing else to
market. That condition is bxiz a
memory to-day. Diversified farming
'has solved the problem and saved
the farmer. His losses in one crop
are met by his gains in another.
This year he will mqre than recoup
himself in alfalfa, corn and cattle.
A big wheat crop, in viev/ of
foreign conditions, would have been
a source of great wealth to the
Northwest. But the price of wheat,
in spite of speculative manipulation,
so is regulated by the law of supply
and demand, that the short crop of
this year may bring as large returns
to the grower as a heavier :rop un
der different conditions.St. Paul
Pioneer Press.
An
WHEAT TAKES A JUMP
OF ELEVEN CENTS.
Wheat took a jump of eleven
cents to-day, the price at Warren
being now $1.38. The unfavorable
crop reports in regard to this cereal
from all parts of the country are
responsible for this phenomenal ad
vance. The government estimate
shows a decrease of 105,000,000
from the forecast reported in July.
Corn, oats, barley, rye, flax, potatoes
and apples show heavy declines of
former estimates. The whole United
States and to a large extent the
whole world faces a lean year, it
would seem.
Grunert-Powell Nuptials.
The home of Mr. and Mrs. W. N.
Powell was the scene of a very
pretty wedding on Wednesday at
high noon when their daughter,
Laura, was given in marriage to
Gustav George Grunert, of Perham,
Minnesota. Immediately preceding
the ceremony Willis Powell, a
cousin of the bride, rendered a fine
clarionet solo, "Bridal Song", by
Adolph Jensen. To the strains of
Mendelssohn's Wedding March play
ed by Miss Ina Powell, the bride's
sister, the wedding party entered the
parlor, the minister and the groom
followed by the bride on the arm of
her father, who gave her in mar
riage. Below decorations of aspara
gus and a bell of pink and white
sweet peas, Rev. D. Samson of the
Presbyterian church pronounced the
solemn words that united the pair
for life, the beautiful ring service
being used.
The bride's gown was a creation of
cream pussy willow taffeta and
georgette crepe trimmed with chan
tilly lace and pearls. The veil was
caught to the hair with white sweet
peas. After congratulations and good
wishes the guests, numbering about
fifty, went to the home of Miss Eva
Powell, an aunt of the bride living
near by, and were served to an
elegant five course dinner. The tables
were decorated in pink and white
sweet peas.
The bridal pair left on the after
noon tram TfojTa short fioney^noon
trip to the Twin Cities and will be
at home to their friends after Octo
ber first at Perham, Minnesota.
The bride's going away gown was
a dark blue gabardine suit and she
wore a felt hat to match.
One notable thing about the wed
ding was the large number of rela
tives present.
The out of town guests were Mrs.
W. K. Grunert of Perham, mother of
the groom, Miss Lizzie Naylor of
Owatonna, Mr. and Mrs. J. E. Hun
ter of Stephen, Miss Lucia Stone of
Crookston and Miss Ruth Rex of
Grand Forks, N. Dak.
The bride was born in Warren ana*
has grown to womanhood here, hav
ing graduated from the Warren
High School and later from the
Stout Institute at Menomonie, Wis
consin. She taught domestic science
in Perham one year and one year
in Fergus Falls. She is an excep
tionally fine and accomplished young
woman. The groom is a promising
young business man of Perham.
The best wishes of all their friends
go with them as they embark upon
the sea of life.
FOX FARM AT TURTLE RIVER.
Animals Brought From Alaska and
Hudson Bay Worth $1,000 Each.
Bemidji is receiving wide publicity
as a game center, the establishment
of the big game refuge here making
possible the preservation of wild life.
The natural facilities provided here
have appealed to a former Minneap
olis man, Dr. Pocce, and he is now
operating a black fox fur farm near
Turtle River.
Dr. Pocce has five foxes on his
farm at present and has gone to
Hudson Bay to secure two more he
has owned for some time. When he
returns to Bemidji he will place
them on his farm, which is being
taken care of by a capable man,
and leave immediately for Alaska
where he has 10 more foxes It will
take many weeks to bring these
foxes to Bemidji as they are in the
heart of the undeveloped region of
Alaska and will have to be placed in
cages and hauled 600 miles on horse
back over the mountains to the sea
coast from where they will be
brought to the western coast of the
United States by steamer. When
these animals are brought to Bemidji
Dr. Pocce will be ready to begin fox
farming on a large scale. He will
have 17 foxes and the worth of his
farm can be realized from the fact
that the value,of the foxes will aver
'age ntoTethatt*$l,000 each.BeHgdji
