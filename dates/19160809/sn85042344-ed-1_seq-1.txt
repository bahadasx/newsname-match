Denounces Owners,
During the closing hours of debate
today, Senator Tillman denounced
southern cotton mill owners oppos
ing the bill and said that while he
believed It iincoiistiutlmial he was
tempted to support it because of the
selfishness of the interests fighting it.
He also declaied congress was too
much influenced by the attitude of
labor In lercsts.
"I have been shocked", said the
South Carolina senator, "to see men
in South Carolina, rich. Intelligent,
well educated men. who were willing
to swell their dividends at the ex
pense of little children. The veil of
sophistry In their letters could not
hide their heartlesslessness. Their
plea, stripped of verbiage, is 'let the
children toil that we may live in lux
ury' and yet we wonder at the spread
cf Socialism and the increasing hos
tility of labor towards capital."
Servility of present day vote srek
crr to organized labor. t,o added, pre
sented as great a problem today as
diil the attitude of politicians twen
ty years ago to concentrated wealth.
"The congress of the I'nited States

frown," he continued. "Capital, with
its biiital, cynical reganl for human
ity started the conflict and labor in
self-defense organized for the strug

WASHINGTON. Aug. 8. Admin
istration leaders believed to
night they hud won their fight for
authorization by congress of the big
naval building program, including
four dreadnaughts and four butt tie
cruisers for 1917, drawn up by the
senate naval committee after confer
ences with President Wilson and Sec
retary Daniels. Majority leader
Kitchen, in serving notice today that
he would call up the bill in the house
next Tuesday, announced that Chair
man Padgett of the house naval com
mittee, one of those who held out in
conference against the senate in
creases, would move that the senate
amendments lie agreed to. Karlier in
(he day Mr. Padgett and Senator
Swanson, ranking Democrats of the
senate committee, had talked over
the subject with President Wilson,
who Is understood to have reiterated
his belief that authorization of the
larger program was imperative.
Senator Swanson said tonight lead
en had made a careful canvass of
the situation and were confident that
the senate's personnel increases and
continuing htiillding program would
be accepted by the house along with
tho building increases for 1S17. A
call was sent broadcast to ubsent
representatives to be on hand for the
vote Tuesday.
SeMirate lloll Culls.
In making his announcement to the
house, the majority leader said sep
arate roll rails would be taken on
the senate amendment Increasing the
capital ships for next year from four
to eight; on the proposal for a gen
eral construction program next year
providing for increased numbers of
submarines, destroyers and other ves
sels U'Mdes thoce of the capital class;
on the three-year continuing pro
gram; on the personnel Increases, and
on the appropriation of $ I ,(iii5,u0u for
a drydock at Charleston, S. C.
That Chairman Padgett would
make a motion to concur in these
amendmentes came as a surprise to
opponents of a big naval program.
They would not concede defeat.
With final action on the naval hill
imminent, the senate today approved
without debate the conference report
of the $2.r 7.000,0110 army appropria
tion bill which will be aetej on in the
house tomorrow.
A favorable vote is expected after
which the bill will go to the president.
If expectations of administration lead
ers are borne out, the naval bill will
follow It to the president's desk within
two weeks at most, anil national de
fense P'gii lation, undertaken as the
salient feati.re of the Sixty-fourth

CHICAGO, Aug. 8. Charles E.
Hughes tonight told an audience
that crowded Chicago's great Coli
seum the ball where he was nomi
nated for the presidency what ho
would do if elected president of the
I'nited States.
Mr. Hughes charged the present ad
iiiiinstralioii with waste, extravagance
and vacillation. He declared that it
bad not kept the country out of war,
but that it had fought an ignominious !
war in Mexico ami had withdrawn!
from that war ignominioiisly. lie!
charged the administration with liav-
ing nrougni ine country much nearer
to participation in the Furopean war
than the country would have been
had the administration "stood for
American righis."
He declared that it was no more
possible to expect tariff protection to
American industries from a Demo
cratic congress than it w'ould be to
get a revival sermon out of a dis
orderly house.
The nominee assailed the adminis
tration also for its appointments to
office and declared that if elected he
wiuld appoint to office only men who
were well iiualificd.
Democratic expenditures for rivers
ami harbors were attacked by the
nominee.
Stop the Hllsllless.
"I piopose that we snail stop this
pork business," be said. "1 propose
that we shall have government in a
business-like way. We wont have
any more if I ran stop it of these
'kiss me and I'll kiss you' appropria
tions in congress."
The nominee said he stood for a
business-like, responsible budget
based on facts,
"I do not want uny hot air in mine,"
he added.
The. Democratic party, Mr. Hughes!
.-aid, was approaching Ibe idea of aj
protective tariff "like a skittish horse (
to a brass band." In 1912, he added,!
the Democratic platform hail said in!
effect that a protective tariff was un- '
constitutional. i
"They say in effect now that the!
L'urouean wai has changed the con-I
titituiion of tne I'nited States,'' he'
continued, "but do you think they arc
converted'' Don't you trust them a
little minute with protecting Ameri
can industry. Tiny haven't got it in
their bones."
Mr. Hughes rei.i'iated much of his
Detroit Hpeerh regarding the admin
istration's Mexican poiicy.
"it had no right," be said, "to ccom
mit this country to a course of eon
duct which landed Mexico in anarchy,
left our citizens a prey to the ravage
of revolution and made our name a
word of contempt in a sister repub
lic. "We have gone forward." the nom
inee said In speaking of the adminis
tration's Mexican policy, "with a de
termination to be destructive, not con
structive, to destroy all they had."

Tragedy on Home.
FORMER EDUCATOR
lie and Small Daughter Die
Instantly; Child at
Death's Door.
WAI.TKR. Okla, Aug. 8 Profes
sor J. K. Malone, former
superintendent of schools in Cotton
county, early tlTis morning shot and
killed his youngest daughter, Leone,
six years old, tried to kill another
daughter, Je.inettc, 1 1 years old,
whom he shot twice through the body
then sent a bullet into his own heart,
dying Instantly. The tragedy occurred
at the Cotton home here, and was dis
covered by neighbors, whose curiosity
had been aroused when none of the
Malone family was seen about the
accustomed morning duties, Jeanetto
was hurried to a hospital, but little
hope is entertained for her recovery.
Ifcsdgncd Heeenlly.
Ill health recently caused Professor
Malone's resignation as county super
intendent of schools. He had been
acting strangely, but no particular sig
nificance was attached lo this fact by
his daughters, with whom he made
his home. Yesterday when the eldest
daughter Kessle, fifteen years old, left
to visit relatives in lawton, she was
bade an affectionate adieu by her
father, who at that time exhibited no
symptoms of mental incapacity. The
fact tnst Kessie left when she did In
all probability saved her life.
Particulars leading up to the trag
edy may never be told, as there is
little probability of .leanette regaining
consciousness, and she is the only one
who knows. From the appearance of
the bodies, however, it is thought the
little girl was shot and killed first,
after which the weapon was turned
on .leanette. Convinced he had killed
both children, Malone is thought to
have gone to his own room, where he
fired a bullet Into his heart. The
revolver was found on the floor be
side Malone's body, it had been
emptied but there was evidence of
only four shots being fired.
rofessor Malone was well known
