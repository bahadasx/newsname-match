Of the recently appointed farm loan
board, the possibility of Columbia

securing one of the 12 land banks
?\ lieh arc to be established when the
i } ,
farm loan board Is organized.
In an informal way Mr. Lever told
the secretary of th'x claims of Colum?
bia. He pointed out that Columbia
is easily accessible to a larpe farm
in:-; section and is an ideal location
with respect to farm mortgages. He
i also called attention to Its splendid
[railway facilities and the fact that
j Columbia made a bid for one of the
federal reserve bank*
Mr. LoVor said Columbia Is grow?
ing rapidly and pointed to the in?
creased postal receipts of th? city in
I
substantiation.
Speaking of his conference tonight,
.Mr. Lever naid: "You can say for me
i mphatically that Columbia Is going
I to make a strong bid for one of these
, land banks, and that there shall be
no let up in the tight in her behalf
until final selections have been made
by the board. 1 believe Columbia is
justly entitled to the most serious
consideration of the board initsselcc
I lion of federal land banks. She has
a great many points of advantage
and superiority, and it is my hope
that the chambers of commerce of
?various towns and cities may join
strongly in this effort to land this en?
terprise for the capital of the State.
Of course Secretary McAdoo could not
[express any opinion In the matter, but
he informs me in an Informal way,
and speaking for himself, that public
i hearings would probably be held in
! Columbia at some time in the future,
j at w hich time the advantages of Co
rurobia may be Laid before the board
*rronr information Y have ItW*'
od 1 take it it will be several months
before Columbia will be reached, for
it is likely the board will begin its
hearings in the New England States
land continue them in the West, com
! plettng its hearings with a tour
through the Southern States. I be?
lieve that Columbia has an equal
chance w ith other Southern cities and
I intend to use every effort in my
power to land this proposition for
her."

MAKING STRUGGLE FOR NAVY
YAR1> THERE.
Senior Senator From South Carolina
Wants Dry Dock Made Long
Enough for Dreadnoughts.
Washington, Aug. 4.?Senator Till
i man is making the tight of his life
for the Charleston navy yard. There
is an item in the naval appropriation
bill of $1,085,000 for the lengthening
of the dry dock there. It is now wide
enough and deep enough, but not long
enough.
The conferees on the naval appro?
priation bill today disagreed on the
appropriation for the dry dock, and,
on insistence of the house conferees,
the issue will be submitted to the
house.
, The conferees agreed on many
[ minor propositions of the measure
'and will be ready to undertake the
big questions of big personnel and
building programme in a few days.
Senator Tillman, chairman, said he
hoped a complete report could be
made before the end of next week.
Speaking of the dry dock fight,
Senator Tillman said: "The matter is
of vital importance not only to the
city of Charleston but to the State
of South Caroline. It concerns the
winde South, in fact, and the navy,
too, who must have such a dock
somewhere south ot Hatteras."
doing on, he said: "I have urged
the members of the house from South
Carolina to remain here and help with
this bill until it becomes a law. The
conferees are now meeting daily to
prepare a report on it. if they can
agree this item will go back to the
house to be voted on. 1 feel that the
South Carolina delegation can help
a great deal with their friends in both
parties, that's the reason 1 am asking
them to remain here. The people al?
ways took cere of me when 1 stayed
here and attended to their business
and 1 believe they wiM-take care ot
their congressmen why Mo the same."
