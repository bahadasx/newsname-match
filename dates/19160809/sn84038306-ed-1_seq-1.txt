frith much interest tbe letter which
we are privileged to publish, and
which ww wrttten by Second Lieu

Mr. Wilson sets forth many inter

Brownsville, and will set at test

I have been somewhat uneasy about the
^welfare of the boys.
Mr. Wilson's letter follows:
Brownsville, Texas, Aug. 2,1916.
Dad:
TIM* 1» the first opportunity I have
fcit'since arriving here to send you

breeze most of the time and ffer
4er than th^ weather you have
having' at home. From Kingston
'dbwnto Brownsville it rained about
fall of the time, and everything was a

We were a pretty, disgusted boo.#,
we expected to have the same kind

found that the lowa Brigade had the

The .ground* is. covered with scrub

must
tell you about pitching
first tents. The engineers put
^jf^seaks were each tent was to go and
the water pipe line was laid which
brings boiled water from town. We
simply cleared enough to let our
z&i tent up and got turned in about nine
Mi'fl thirty. We were pretty nervous about
spiders, snakes, etc. Every one prop

sounds like we wer$ in a bad hole,
but you ought to we our street now.
We have worked steady three days
and the" place looks like a park. We
have twenty-five or thirty shade trees
but hot nearly as big a» the elms in
the back yard. The ground is all to

it looked before and after, and- when
we' get them developed will send you

The water Urgood, but like all boil

The Gulf breeze seems to keep ail

mother doesn't need to worry about

(By Edith F. Norton)
Calais w% found most intereeting
whether down at the water's edge,
watching tbe Red Cross boats bring
ing their cargo of wounded British
soldiers^ straight from the battle field,
transferring them so tenderly-, Ib
stretchers to waiting ambulances,
driven by khaki clad Bngltah girls,
and then seeing these self same girls
driving off the huge ambulances with
their suffering freight Inside, so slow
ly and genty, that the care seemed to
merely crawl along, every Jolt or sud

season a band concert was in prog*
all was Interesting. For we
were gaalng upon history In the mak
ing, soldiers of every nationality were
thronging the streets, fraternising and
proving the oommon.1bond of brother
hood.
Bnt I must speak of our visit to
the Gendarmeries at Calais. As I
mentioned In my last article, we had
for nftw*lwt been corresponding with
many Gendarmes who had joined the
"Idgue des 8aintea Ecritnres/' or
Scripture League, saying they would
like to possess a New Testament in
French or Flemish, and would read in
It each day. We had written to ap
praise our Gendarme friends oC our
piPT'ig through Calais, and to prom
ise them a little vislt^v
8o the second day otour stay there!,
we repaired to the address given us,
9" Rue de Guise. After much difficult
wandering about a narrow twisting
street, we were finally directed by a
kindly French girl to an entrance way
l^vling to tbe Gendarmle in question.
It proved to be an improvised bar
racks, formerly a large amusement
hall. How many transformations of
Uust kind had we 'season 4$ Oontl

•h and tutlle for us to think that civ
IlludllMlhas changed the human heart.
There always have been wars, there
always will be wars right down to the
end of time, tor the human heart with
Its passions end selfish ambitiOne nev

about the Christian nations Let us
mistake, there is no such thing as a
Christian nation, en masse. There are

Americana to prepare we are today
awakening to .the certainty that soon
er or later it will be our turn to •enter
the tfena, and we must be ready. And
the surest precaution against having
to fight, is to be too formidable for an
alien enemy lightly to,confront! lit
tle Swltserland with an army of 500,
000 which in two weeka could be put
fully equipped into the field, remains
nnmolestied in this great world strug
gle, although surrounded by heredit
ary enemies. Belgian citiaens are say
lng to us, "Why were we so blind as
to kill Uie bill for increased arma
ment, it would have meant security
for us now rather than ruin and des
olatlo^." But now it is too late..
Six years ago. when my husband
and I voyaged from Yokahama, Japan,
to Port Said in Egypt, on the German
boat, the "Princese AUce" we met a
very pleasant, courteoua German ex
officer, who waa at that timiB. Krupp's
representative in China. Also on the
same boat we had the unhappiness to
be eeated at the same table in the din
ing saloon with a most unpleasant and
diacorteous Englishmen. As we talk
ed with the German officer, and sug­
gested
it
otherwise ha iiMr inevitable.
But to return to the Gendarmerie
from which wejhmva made a little ex
cursion. When we entered the great
barracks, felt a tittle confused, es
pecially I, for 1 wasn't just sure that
I had any rlffet to be there. What we
ssiw was a verltJmle jaldler's quarters.
Blanket beds lylng pe by side on the
floor, whlla abofe a baleony were
other beds tM liki kind. Tin Gend
armes In varlo** qfcges of undress
were scattered abeWS sitting on their
floor beds repairing their clothing,
playing gamesr trritln'g leters, etc. A
little group was gathered about the
stove at one end of the hall. Thither
we turned our Meps. In French I
spoke to one Gendarme who turned to
ward us( at our approach. W&eit we
told htm onrjuunes, his face instantly
became all smlta*. ''hut we were fii.
and Npe. Norton,' then a thousand
weledhus. for wa* he not a member
of our league, ahd bad be not written
us many letters," so he addressed us.
He In turn Introduce^, us to many oth
ers who came crowding around us, and
at last very proudly, presented to us,
the chef of the Gebdarmie, not the
cook, but "ae we would say the head
or chief be was it seems, the l*teat
recruit to the league, and was consid
ered a great trophy. Then, tor one
eanot be too al^rt When talking with
Latin peoples, after some gfadous
wordk all aroun^and much bowing
and salutinjg, we |memised to come to
the Gendarmle at %i£ o'clock in the
evening and give than a little music
and a few spoken ifords.
But Just befor^tour departure we
•re* told tfeP? ®f»t Gendarme
friend, that ttyjfc Iras still another
Gendarmle in Calais, and that the
other members would be greeily
grieved If we did^hot alsO pay them'a
viBlt, io we agreed to also bold a lit
tle service with thaem, at seven o'clodL
Their hour for rt|iri*g was eight, so
we had to be eafj^r.

great, as owning ail the nrsnch in the
family, and I realised my precaiicus
position to .the full tt»t night The
two meetings were visry similar so 'I
shall describe the test one.
As we entered, tie men aU gath
red as closely around ua as possible,
and by the light oC the candle I sang
the words of my first song. It was a
great' ftaprlte In England, being the
auccessor to "Tipperaty," and borfe

shining.
This
the possibility of a war with
England, he answered us with perfect
assurance that
firm
was bound to come
soon, and that it was no secret with
Germans, and in Germany, but that
as rapidly as possible, they were pre
paring for, and toasting "the day." We
repeated the conversation to the un
pleaeant Englishman, and he- laughed
us to scorn. He treated us with abso
lute and insolent contempt, for even
suggesting such a possibility.' So he
and his fellow country men were un
ready the clearest proof possible that
England had- not anticipated or pre
pared for, a war at this time. Now
many of our friends on this
Bide,
who
are broad, fair-minded men, are say-'
ing to us, "You can see what we have
earned by our foolish blindness, but be
you taught by your bitter lesson." It
isn't a Blatter of our courting, war, it
is a matter of our being prepared for
the Inevitable, or better being In the
place where we can avoid what^ would

With ihstant success. Then I sang them
i, little .Chorus, which I had trans
Ifatedi Into'fNnch, And whichi they
quickly learned and sang with up. Af
ter this I followed with a little talk In
French, and we closed with -the sing
ing of the Belgian national air, the
ed. Then the adjutant chef respond
ed with a few wofds of thanks in be
half of the others, and we left feel
ing that our Uttle effort) had been
warmly appreciated.
I want to Say & word about the
"Brabanconne", song of courage and
hope, and wonderfully suggestive, at
this time. It is I believe, a very old
song, and l,luiOw of no people who so
prise their song as do the Belgiana.
In the park at Calais, I watched the
tarowd of I^encbi British. Russian and
Belgian soldiers and civilians, as their
national airs were played. On the part
of none .was there any demonstration,
until the "Brabanconne" waa struck
up. Then there waa a concerted
movement among the crowd, and ev
ery Belgian, be he soldier or civilian,
came to Balute and held It rigidly to
the end. The next arttde will re
