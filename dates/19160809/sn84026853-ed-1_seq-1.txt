health of Mrs. Simmons was seriously
undermined.

Powerful Attack
TURKS DO NOT MENTION THE
VICTORY OF THE BRITISH
FORCES.
Paris, Aug. 8.?The Germans re
I captured the strong ThiaumOnt words'
northeast of Verdun in a powerful
assault early this morning. Fighting
is still raging around the redoubt
Last night there was a terrrible
bombardment in five violent attacks
by a large force directed at the
French positions from Fleury to the
Thiaumont redoubt. The Fleury attacks
were repulsed. In. joint attacks
at Guillamont, north of Somme
one reached the outskirts of the
village.
A new shell with a fragmentation
of from 10,000 ,to 15,000 pieces has
been introduced. The Germans are
believed to have tried glass shells
to secure high fragmentation from
powdered glass, but abandoned them
because the fragments were too minute.
The tests of -, the German
shells shows immense advantage to
the French.

WHITENING UP THE TOWN.
There was no snow in Abbeville
last weeK as a casual odserver wuum
have supposed, bat the white on the
ground was simply a generous response
to the request of the cifer
board of health that the premises be
cleaned up and lime scattered. The
prolonged spell of wet weather will
certainly bring about much sickness
in the city unless our people are
careful to keep clean.

is well cared for and just now in full
bloom wiiile the vine clad chimney is
beautiful to behold. Chief of the
many beautiful flowers is the crepe
myrtle in brilliant bloom and of artistic
shape, which stands in the corner
of the yard and the old fashioned
pink althea which distracts our attention
every time we stand up for
prayer during the morning service.

The Germans have suffered further
losses at the hands of the French between
the Hem wood and: the river
Somme, losing there a line of their
trenches and 120 prisoners and . ten
machine guns. In the Verdun sector .
the French also made progress south. ; < > . ,
of the Thiaumont. work, capturing
five machine guns and taking some >
houses in the western part of the village
of Fleury..
After a heavy bombardment of tl}? \ British
position, the Germans launched
violent Infantry attacks north and
northeast of Pozieres and at two c.;'
laces succeeded in entering British
trenches. Their success was not long
lived, for the British soon drove
them out, inflicting heavy casualties.
Amid continuous heavy rains
which have turned the country into' a
quagmire, the Russians are keeping
up their strong offensive against .?
the Teutonic Allies in northern Galacia
and have pushed further forward
their lines against them in the
Sereth and Graberki rivers^ region.
Also along the Stokhod river, in
Volhynia, "near the town of Zarecze,
the Russians have driven the Teutons
from their trenches and occupied
them, taking 12 officers and 200
men prisoners and capturing one
machine gun in the operation. In the
Carpathians the Germans report the
capture of two peaks from the Russians.
Constantinople reports^ series of
gains for the Turks fighting against
the Russians, and Petrograd admits
at least one of the claims?that the
Russians have been forced to retire
under pressure to the region east of
Kermanshah, Persia.
The latest reports concerning the
attack of Turks against the British
forces with the Suez canal their objective
indicates that' the Ottoman. . .
forces met with a reverse even more
serious than was first chronicled;
Driven back 18 miles into the desert,
fighting rear guard actions, they
suffered heavy casualties and of
4heir total force of 10,000 lost 45
officers and 3,000 men made prisoners.
They now have been entirely
