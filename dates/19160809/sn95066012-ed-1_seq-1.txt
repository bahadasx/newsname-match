SOLDIERS SHOW FORESIGHT
Guard Mors Property That Any Other
Regiment at Eagle Pass.
A dispatch from Eagle Pass, Texas,
to the Boston l'ost contains the follow
ing reference to the Vermont regi
ment: "The worst sand storm of the sea
son visited the camp this evening. The
storm lasted about 40 minutes. The
Vermonters' tents are up to stay. Not
so the tents of some of the other regi
ments, which came toppling to the
ground the tents, not the regiments.
'The mess tents bl CoL Reeves' men
have been all screened in. The sand
sprinkled the food of the men of the
neighboring regiments, but here again
the foresight of the northerners prov
ed a saving to them.
"Everybody Is in line health. Col
onel Reeves has a sunburned hand
that seems to be about tho extent of
tbo casualties.
"The Vermonters have the distinc
tion of guarding more property than
any other regiment at Fa tie PaSB.
Tho territory which they are defend
ing covers more than St miles. It
certainly looks as If the military au
thorities had every faith In them and
the follows are rekarding this faith
with good service."
Summer in the Churches.
Commenting on the common sight
of church doors closed in vacation
with the pastors at cool summer re
sorts, It is often remarked that the
devil never takes a vacation. At the
same time, the youngster who is held
rigidly down to Sunday school at a
period when the daj schools are real
ing. does not feel any more friendly
toward the ideas tho church stands
for.
When a boy remarked "We have
a very kind minister at our church.
who D reaches short sermons on hot
Sundays," the old folks laughed, but
felt that he had hit a real truth.
Tbo Soman Catholic, Episcopal,
nnd many other churches Mill keep
open doors In the summer, without
teasing people to go If they don't feel
like It. Thereby they show their
readiness to serve without nllicious-
ness. To many the cool silence nnd
peace of the sanctuary Is more pleas
ant and more restful than tho speed
of the motor or the tumult of the
bleachers. Hurl Ington News.

All but few property owners of
Bennington have nice gardens for
beauty's sake alone. However, then
Is another side to the question which
especially those few who do not can
for beauty and do just about enough
landscape gardening work to satisfy
minimum requirements, should seri
ously consider. It is that nothing en
hances the value of property as much
as nice surroundings.
On more than one of the streets of
Bennington and especially on Main
street thero are a number of plecai
of property which, If they hud to bt
sold within a short time, would not
realise as much as they should, solel
because their appearance is not pieis
ing. Just where buildings are old am
out of date, there is need of landscapi
gardening work to relieve their plain
and more or less unsightly fcaiuii
and in a great many cases a Pew dol
lars worth of plants and a le,v boars
work annually for maintenance will
enchnnce 'he value of property by scv
oral hundred dollars.
In a previous article, the writer lias

PANES OF POSTAGE STAMPS.
And the Plate Numbers, Loiters or
Symbols They Carry.
All our postage stamps are printed
In large sheets of 400 stamps each.
These arc then cut Into four "panes"
of 100 stamps each ami scut to the
various postoflioes In that shape.
If you were to go to any United
States iostotnco and buy a complete
"sheet," or, more correctly speaking, n
complete "pane," of 100 stamps you
would find that it had on two sales nn
outer margin, nnd on each of these
margins would be a number. This Is
the number of tbo plate from which
that pane was printed, Fndcr this
number the authorities keep a record
of the plate, the dato of Us making,
on what days it wns In use, the quan
tities of stampe printed from It and all
such data.
These plate numbers are usually ex
pressed in figures or letters or combi
nations of both, but sometimes other
symbols are used, such as tho "star"
plates, of recent date. Many stamp
lovers form what aro called "plate
number collections'' that Is. a collec
tion in Which every stamp still has at
tached to It the outer margin beating
the plate number. Tho object is. of
course, to get every plate number that
was ever issued.
It Is Interesting nnd curious, too, be
cause the stamps are arranged with
the plate numbers In sequence, making
thetn look very different from an ordi
nary collection. Tor Instance, plate
No. 2.13 is n five cent postage stamp,
w-hilo the next three. 2." I, 205 and 236,
are postage tlno Stamps, Plate 237 is
a special delivery.' nnd 238 a newspa
per stamp. So a collection of these Ir
sequence Is very Varied and Interest
lug.
And, again, many of the plates were
in use at a time when the color of the
stamp was changed, and the snir.o
plate number may be found upon both
colors, as tbo one cent bine and tho
one cent green, or the ten cent green
ami the ten cent brown, the fifteen
cent blue and the fifteen cent olive.

Gaining Ground.
There are encouraging signs that
the idea, for which the Standard has
long contended, that a different pol
icy is needed in the construction and
upkeep of Vermont highways, is gain
ing ground.
Prom all over the state come re
ports of the imsalisfactory results
under a system of loose local control
and unscientific methods ami this is
bringing about a demand for a
change that will recognize the prin
ciple of complete! state control nnd
the fimtftrmontal fact that road
building, under the conditions of
modern traffic, is an engineering prob
bun of the first magnitude,
Dnder the recent federal nltl act
which provides fur the distribution
of government funds among the
states for road building, the first
apportionment of funds has been
made. Vermont',! chare of this fund
is small but it affords an opportunity
to consider the question of a new
policy in the expenditure of Ver
mont's highway money.
The Kutlaml Herald, in an edito
rial discussion of the federal aid law
and Vermont's share of the annual
appropriation which it estimates will
amount in a live year period, with
the required state appropriation, to
1100,000 says:
The expenditure of S00,000 on a
continuous stretch of highway, a
trunk Una route, certainly will give
Vermont a claim to having some
thing resembling the "state roads"
to be found In other states. To be
sure we have "state mails" in Ver
mont roatls built largely from an
appropriation lecelvtd trotn the high
way department but the varviim
qualities ami kinds of material used,
with connecting stretches of Kor
roads, spoil the general effect.
I'or years there lots ben talked
the need nf a well-built ami well
en ad for trunk-line highway on each
side of the Green mountain range,
Ii would seem that there is to come
the opportunity to begin the con
struction fopno of these arterial high
reads.
t Is announced In Washington that
the construction work ami labor in
en h stale is to he done in accordance
with state laws under Immediate
supervision of the state highway de
partmeni. subject to inspection and
approval hy the government en
nii'is. The selection of road routes
Is to be left to state highway do-
partments, subject to the approval
of the secretary of Rtato. Thus, It
appears, Vermont can say where it
will extend Its share ol the Icderal
appropiiatiou.
Wherever we spend tho federal
