strike, if necessary, tying up
250,000 miles of railways of the
country, the union heads will;
discuss the questions involved
with the railway officials, but
will not consent to calling an in

upon the railway managers today

It brought the situation be
tween the employers and em
ployes to- a deadlock within an
hour after the first of their
scheduled conferences was called.

railway managers, declared the
railroads would insist upon medi
ation. UNION MEN FIRM.
The union representatives were Just
as Arm In declaring- this method of at
tempting1 to reach a settlement useless,
and Insisting that they would not con
sent to an Intermediary entering into
the negotiations.
The railroads proposed mediation.
Members of the Federal Board of
Mediation and Conciliation are now
here, but the brotherhood heads de
clare they have no desire to see thefcn.
With the conference thus deadlocked,
the meeting broke up and the railway
managers set out In search of the Gov
ernment mediators.
The brotherhood officials went Into
executive session.
Kllsha Leo formally Invited the United
States board to otter Its good offlcos
in reaching a settlement.
Members of the board, who are hero
at President Wilson's request, met and
framed a letter to the representatives
of the employes asking that the di
man&s be submitted to the board. JudKn
Martin Knapp, chairman of the board,
said this afternoon a meeting of the
representatives and of the employes and
employers may be called this evening.
Garretson eald this afternoon the em
ployes would meet with the board, but
they were unwilling to join the em
ployers In asking for the services of the
mediators.
U. S. WILL COLLECT
LOANS TO REFUGEES
Plans to Sue for Money Loaned
Stranded Americans.
Uncle Sam will use the unspent por
tion of the money appropriated by Con
gress to bring stranded Americans home
from Europe at the outbreak of the
('war of wars" In trying to collect the
loans made to many of the refugees.
About 30 per cent of those who were
loaned money to return to their native
land have failed to this time to return
the money. .

Americanism.
WINONA, Mrnn., Aug. 9. Candidate
Hughes had his first try-out as a rear
platform campaigner In the Preeldentlal
raco today. It happened here this
morning when the Republican standard
bearer told a crowd of nearly a thousand
people that he looked for a revival of
tho American spirit.
When the governor concluded a ,brlef
speech, former Congressman Jim Taw
ney, whoj home is In Winona, said
he had been told by tho candidate to
tell the crowd that ho was too tired
to shake hands. Hughes smilingly in
terrupted: ,
"No," he Interjected, "what I said was
that my volco waa a llttlo tired, but that
I wouia do aougiuca to shako hands
with everybody here. I'm coming right

But at that moment the train started
nnd the governor had to hurry back

MINORITY
DISSENTS
F
Ben Johnson Files Report
Against Municipal Car Own
ership Here.
On behalf of the minority of the
House District Committee, Chairman
Ben Johnson today filed a dissenting
report On the Crosser bill for the
municipal ownership of street rail
ways In the District.
Tho report says that the residents of
the District are not demanding this
legislation and that it would be un
fair to tax the people here through a
heavy bonded debt which would be nec
essary If the street railways are to
be taken over.
"fire minority report refers to aj

Second Adverse Report.
The minority report filed today Is
supplementary to that filed by the min
ority In the Sixty-third Congress. This
old report opposing municipal ownership
Is again presented.
The eight members of the District
Committee, who recently voted against
the Crosser bill, signed the supplement
ary report, as prepared by Congress
man Johnson. The signers of the re
port are Congressmen Johnson. Oakey,
Ragsdale, Darrow, Gould, Focht, Wil
son, nnd Plnkham.
It is argued by the minority that It
would be a most unusual proceeding to
Impose a 50,000,000 bond Issue without a
referendum vote In the District.
"In all other municipalities," says the
report, "the people have the ballot, and
the question of assuming an enormous
municipal debt Is usually submitted to
them. In the District of ColuVnbla the
people are deprived of the ballot; but,
notwithstanding this, we do not believe
the legislative body for the District
would Impose nn enormous debt upon
so small a community without first as
certaining that It Is the desire of those
who are to bear the debt to havo It
Imposed."
