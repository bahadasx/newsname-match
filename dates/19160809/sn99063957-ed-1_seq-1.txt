London, Aug. 9. The great Austrian stronghold of
Goritz, which for 14 months has blocked an. Italian in
vasion of Austria from the west, has fallen before the
victorious Italian armies.
The information first given the United Press from a
London source, was confirmed a few minutes later by the
receipt of official dispatches from Rome.
The Italians are believed to have stormed the citadel
last night or early today, only a few hours after they had
battered their way to victory at the Goritz bridgehead
and captured Monte San Michele, overlooking Goritz
from the south. .
Ten thousand Austrian prisoners were taken,, accord
ing to reports reaching London.
News of the Italian stroke, the greatest single victory
for the allies since the triple offensive against the central
empires began, was received here an hourafter official
word came from Petrograd of another striking Russian
victory.
Advancing swiftly toward
of btamslau, the Russians captured the town of Tysmien
ica an advance of six miles in 24 hours and a series of
minor villages and fortified river heights in the immedi
ate vicinity. The capture of
ers in this region alone was announced by the Petrograd
war office. -
On the Somme front only minor' operations were re
ported by the British and French war offices today, iri
cluding a slight British advance north of Pozieres. The
French officially admitted the recapture of the Thiaumont
work by Germans northeast of Verdun. ;
News of the fall of Goritz came as no surprise to Lon
don after word of the capture of the bridgehead and sur
rounding positions had been received. A United Press
dispatch from Rome this forenoon said that the fall of
Goritz itself was a matter of but a few hours, "if it is
not already in Italian hands."
The taking of Goritz, the greatest
achievement for Italian arms since Italy
declared war on Austria in May, 1915,
opens the way for an Italian advance
Hoiithward toward Trieste, one of the
j.rincipiil goals of the Italians.
Goritz is the point of convergence of
important railways and the key to the
whole plain opening up to the invasion
of Austria from the west.
In earlier attacks upon the great Aus
Irian stronghold the Italians had sacri
ficed many thousands of lives. The
Austrian! too have suffered enormous
ly in repelling Italian attacks.
Following successful artillerying the
Italians also completed the occupation
nf heights west of Goritz, said the of
ficial dispatch from Home. Large quan
tities of armj, ammunition and other
in.'iterinl fell into Italian hands.
The advancing Italian troops found
trenches and dugouts filled with Aus
trian corpses.
On Monte Ban Michele, enemy coun
ter attacks were repulsed. More enemy
trenches were captured in tho region
of Sun MnrtinO.
The city of Goritz hus a population of
about 30.000 and is the capital of a
province. It lies on the east bank of
the Isonzo surrounded on three side?

Perhaps the most notable building of
the city is the ancient castle, formerly

modern times converted into a barracks.
The city has a famous fourteenth cen
tury cntliedral and a fine museum.
Two Million Fighting
By John H. Hearly
(United Press staff correspondent)
Rome, Aug. H. Two million men are
battling fiercely nlong the Isonzo front
in a great struggle centering about lo
ritz that may prove the turning point
or the war.
With the Goritz bridgehead and sur
rounding heights strongly in Italian
hands, Jtniian troops are pouring across
the river for the assault upon Goritz
itself, singing gnilv as thev advance
under hot fire, their helmets decked
witii flowers.
Scores of great guns already are
pounding the Austrian stronghold. It
is believed certain here that Goritz
will fall before a storming attack with
in a few hours if it is not already in
Italian hands.
The battle is spreading along the
Isonzo. In the first two davs of the
great offensive more than 11,000 Aus
trian prisoners were captured. The
Austrians resisted with the greatest
stubbornness and suffered frightful
losses.
Home was swept wih a tremendous
wave of enthusiasm today as fresii dis
patches from the front brought frag
mentary details of the righting around
Goritz. The whole city was instantly
bet'lngged when announcement of the
capture of the Gorit bridgehead was
made. A huge crowd gathered in Pi
azzi' Colonna and cheered the army,
King Victor Emmanuel nud General
Cadorna. Similar demonstrations oc
curred in the theatres and cafes.
In other Italian cities, Milan, Bo
logna, Leghorn and Florence, great
crowds gathered in patriotic demon
strations that lasted all night. The
general conviction is that the war of
fice statement was most conservative
and that Italy is ou the brink of
great and decisive victory that will
send Italian armies marching on
Trieste.
Awe Inspiring Spectacle.
"This is only the beginning of opera
tions promising great developments,"
said the newspaper Corriere d 'Italia.
