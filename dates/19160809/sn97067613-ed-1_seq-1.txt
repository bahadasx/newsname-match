Late last Wednesday afternoon, as Mr.

Roystan, in attempting to pass them,
struck a rear wheel of the Peck wagon.
Mr. Peck was thrown out and the horse,
which , is a . spirited animal, started to
run. M rs. feck remained in - the wagon
until the horse had dragged Mr. Peck
some distance, when she was thrown out
and the animal freeing himself from the
driver, ran nearly to Wolcott before he
was stopped. Mrs. Peck was taken to
her home and a physician was called. It
was found that no bones were broken
ana ner condition was much im
proved today. Mr. Peck was not injured

being a very careful driver, is unable to
account for tne accident.
