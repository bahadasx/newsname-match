AVE LAWYERS
EACEQIARGES
Disbarment Recommended
by Minnesota Associa

Duluth, Minn., Aug. 9.—Five Min
nesota attorneys will be stripped of
their right to practice law in this
if recommendations adopted by
the Minnesota State Bar association In
annual session here are carried out
by the state board of law examiners.
The names of the five are withheld.
In its report the committee on
ethics expressed itself as being de
sirous of ridding the profession of
lawyers whose conduct violates their
oaths. This, tho report says, requires
of the bar generally a proper stand
ard of moral responsibility. The re
port says that the public rightly looks
to the bar to purge itself of those of
its members whose misconduct merits
not only the criticism of the bai\ but
its disciplinary action.
In a discussion of the report It was
pointed out that for years the courts
of the state have been crowded with
suits framed up by dishonorable
lawyers. The present law gives them
the privilege of bringing a suit, pre
senting their evidence and getting It
dismissed, going through this opera
tion four or five times until the vic
tim is completely worn out and makes
settlement to prevent heine harrassed
further. It is this procedure that the
bar association would prevent.
An address bv Hon. Frank B- Kel

uniform state laws, report of mem
