FOR SALS BY
MIKE BROWN
4 4 The Square Deal Man"
Chicago, AuguBt 8 Charles K.
Hughes tonight told an audience that
crowded Chicago's great coliseum,
tho hall where he wits iiomlmited
what lie would do If elected ('resident
of the I'nited States.
-Mr. Hughes charged the present ad
ministration with waste, extrava
gance and vacillation. He declared
that it has not kept the country out of
war, lint thut it had fought and igno
minious war lu Mexico and hud with
drawn from that war ignominiously
He charged the administration with
having brought tho country much
nearer to participation in the Euro
pean war than the country would have
been had the "administration stood on
American rights."
Protection rolicy Flayed
He declared it was no more possible
to expest tariff protection to American
industry from a Democratic Congress
than it would be. to get a revival ser
mon out of a disorderly house "
The nominee assailed the adminis
tration also for its appoiutaiodts to
nice and doclared that if elected he
would appoint to office only men who
were well qualified.
Democratic expenditures for rivers
and harbors were attacked hy the
nominee.
"I suppose that we shall stop this
pork business," he said. "I propose
that we shall have government in n
business like way. We won't have
any more, if I can stop it, of 'kiss me
and I'll kiss you' appropriation ln
Congress."
-o Hot Air" or Candidate
The nominee Baid he stood tor a
"business like responsible budget,"
based on fact.
"I do not want any hot olr in mine,"
he added.
"The Democratic party," Mr. Hughes
said, was approaching the idea of a
protective tariff, "like a skittish horse
to a brass band." In 1912, he added,
the Democratic platform had said in
effect that u protective tariff waa un
constitutional. They say In effect now
that the Europeau war has changed
the aonstitution of the Cnited States,
he continued, "but do you think they
are converted. Don't you trust them
a little minute with protecting Ameri
can industries They have not got it
in their bones."
Detroit Speech Repeated
Mr. Hughes reiterated much of his
I 'i ti.ni speech regarding the adminis
tration's Mexican policy.
"It has no right to commltt thla
country to a course of conduct which
lended Mexico ln auarchy, left our
citizens a prey to the ravages of rev
olution and make our name u word
of contempt in a sister republic."
"We have gone forward," the uomi
nee said, In speakiug of the adminis
tration's Mexican policy, "with a de
termination to be destructive, uot con
structive, to destroy all they laid "
KorelgH Policy lllsrussed
At to the administration's foreign
policy Mr. Hughes said:
"I propose thai we have a uew birth
of American purpose and courage. Wa
have no occasion to fear war In the
assertion of those rights, which all
1 reooglie and only respect us for nialn
! Liming. Hut if we are glib iu speech,
I if we indicate that we are uot ready
to meet the full responsibility that
our words Imply we are pushed a lit
tle further and a little further until
some flue day eveuta occur which
arouse au Implacable resentment fruiu
oh and of th country to the other.
Tnat 1s th dangfr of war
"This udmininstratlon lins conic
nearer to lunding us in war by Itt
weakness than It would have ever
have come had It stood faithfully for
American rights and had let it be
lOWfJ that they would be defended
thatlon in Coliseum
"I believe that with our peaceful
PM BOMB, our just purposes we have
uc occasion to be drawn into strife
W. we are prepared, If we are dig
nified, if we show that wo mean what
iwe say. And 1 desire that as we look
to the future, we shull have American
citizenship, tho proudest title In the
world; American administration ;ih
efficient as any In the world and
American honor Ihe cherished thought
or every American citizen."
Mr. HiigheB spoke for nearly an
hour. He entered n hall that was no
jammed that even the steel cross glrd-j
ers wer-' utilized for seats The audi-1
er.ee cheered him for five minutes bo-1
fore he j.oke A brass band, perched I
in a loft at the far end of Ihe hall

tion, but the music was lost In the1
