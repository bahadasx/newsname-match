Market Jumps Phenomen

Chicago, 111-, Aug. 9. Wheat prices
shot upward eight cents a bushel to
day right at the start. December op
tion touched $1.45 on first trading as
pgainst 1.37 at Tuesday's finish, and
soared up to $1.50.
Sensational crop damage, confirmed
by the government report, was the
cause of the extraordinary advance.
So much excitement ruled in the pit
that transactions in many cases were
three cents apart at the same instant
The initial range on December varied
from $1.42 to $1.45.
Jumps in the value of other options
than December, although radical, were
not quite eo severe. Taken as a whole,
the market opened 5 to 8 cents higher,
and when relative steadiness was es
tablished showed 5 3-4 to 6 3-4 cents

" Grabateria" Groceries
Are Opened In Portland
Portland, Ore, Aug. 9. "Grabateria"
is a name of a new kind of store
launched on the east side yesterday.
The name is an adoption of portions of
cafeteria, where, without a waiter, one
selects his own dishes and pays for
what he takes.
A grabateria is a grocery store
where no clerks are employed. Every
article is marked with the price, and
the customer selects what he wants
and walks up to the cashier's counter,
where it is paid for. In the "graba
teria" there are no clerks, no delivery
wagons and no charged accounts.
It is claimed for the grabateria es
tablishment that the saving on deliv
ery and clerk hire alone will be from
10 to 25 percent- In Los Angeles they
are called groceterias.

ASIUNGTON, D. C. Aug. 9.
Formal announcement was
made today by acting secre-
of Gen. Carranza's proposal for a Joint
international commission to seek a so
lution of border disputes and to dis
cuss other matters which may clarify
relations between the United States
and Mexico.
Secretary Lane, of the interic de
partment will head the American com
mission, supported by associate justice
Louis D. Brandeis of the supreme court,
and a third commissioner, whose name
will be announced later. A telegram
asking the third man to serve was sent
today by president Wilson and his name
will not be disclosed until his accep
tance is received.
The Mexican commissioners were
named some days ago, Luis Cabrera,
minister of finance In the Carranza
government, heading the delegation.
This made necessary the appointment
of a member of president Wilson's cab
inet in the American membership.
Carranza In Complete Accord.
Today's announcement followed a
brief conference between Mr. Polk and
Mr. Arredondo. Carranza's ambassador
designate. Final assurance was given
by Mr. Arredondo that Gen. Carranza
was in complete accord with sugges
tions of the Washington government
hat the discussions of the commission
ers be given the broadest possible
scope. The ambassador said that his.
government resarded its recent not

as a full answer and acceptance of sec

be broadened.
Will Take L'p Ilorder Question.
As it begins its task the commission
will be required first to reach some
conclusion on the specific points out
lined by Gen. Carranza In his original
proposal. The first subject treated un
der this view would be the withdrawal
of American troops from Mexico, to
be followed by negotiations of a pro
tocol covering future military opera
tions along the border. Since thes
two points are closely interwoven it is
believed the commission will couple
them together in whatever recommend
ations it has to make.
Tn Intextlgate InterventlonlHt.
The immediate military situation on
the border disposed of. the commission
will be ready to proceed with Its re
maining specific task, investigation to
determine whether interests desiring
intervention have inspired border raids.
It is believed the commission will
be left to map out its own course in
tracing the source of these raids. With
out doubt. It will have power to travel
to the border, or if necessary, into
Mexico in following up its inquiry.
Mexican Plenaed "With rirandels.
There have been intimations that
American insistence upon broadening
the scope of the commission's powers
has been due to the hope that a way
of giving constructive aid to the Car
ranza government could be found.
Secretary Lane has been In close
touch with the Metican situation ever
since he entered the cabinet.
Mexicans here are known to be well
pleased with the selection of judge
Brandeis. They believe he has a nat
ural sympathy with the purposes of the
revolutionary movement In Mexico.
