ANOTTIER'DISCUSSION OF ,
THE PLUMBING. ORDINANCE
There was another spirited discus
sion of the "proposed plumbrngl ordi
nance before council last night. Since
the last meeting of the body, there
has been an investigation of the ques
tion, as to whether the ordinance , re
turned by;, the .mayor unsigned,- and
which 'council held- in abeyance, had
become a law: It was decided" that
the measure had not become a law,
and an entirely new ordinance, con
taining the amendments approved by
the judiciary committee; was intro
duced ; last night. ? The GreenfLbve
ridge amendment to permit any per
son' to do plumbing, provided that the
work meet the approval of the, plumb
ing inspector, again' came under fire.
Councilman Mclvert with considerable
feeling "contended that" the ordinance
would work a hardship on ' many a
poor .citizen unless the .Green-Love-
ridge.. amendment be adopted. Coun
cilman Fausett spoke in favor of the
amendment for similar reasons. -
Councilman MefFert. proposed a iiew
section for. the ordinance providing
that a property owner might do his
ownplumbing work en his own .prem
ises under the supervision of the
plumbing inspector, , and providing
that in case of such work there be
an extra charge of $1 ;for each extra
visit, Mr. Meff ert . did riot n think
there -was any harm irf the clause, as
it had been stated that there was no
way of "preventing a property owner
from doing work on his own property.
Councilmen - Gerig and Weathers
voted against the Mefferi amendment,
which" was' incorporated in the ordi
nance, .ine orainance was piacea on
first "read to take its usual course. S
IvMr. Emanuel" Martin,' who , is acting
city attorney in; the absence of Fred
erick Hocker, wrote the . amendment
proposed by Councilman Meffert." Af
ter the adoption of v the, amendment,
Mr. Martin stated that he 'wished to
have it understood that he, had noth
ing to. "do with the new provision ex
cept, tfie" actual . writing of it." He
thought that the amendment would
play havoc with the whole ordinance.
Mr. Martin had previously expressed
a doubt as to whether there was real
ly any difference between a property
owner himself ' doing . work on his
own property, and a property, owner
emnloviner someone else to do -the
x v i
same-work.

REPAIRING THE 4
SILVER SPRINGS ROAD
Ed. Carmichael Offers ttt Lead jn the
' Necessary Enterprise
Mr, Ed. , Carmichael appeared be
fore council last night and made prb
posals to the city with regard to the
repairing of the Silver Springs road,
and with regard ' to lighting the
springs. Mr. Carmichael -told council
that if the city would remove the lime
rock from the pit east of Greenwood
cemetery and place the material on
theroadside near the pit, he felt, con
fident that a sufficient fund could be
raised among the citizens of Ocala to
repair the highway now in such
wretched condition v because of. the
city's being without sufficient road
funds. 3Ir. Carmichael said that he
would Himself furnish a double wagon
and team for the work, and keep it
busy until the repair,. was finished. At
the instance of - Councilman ; Meffert,
President Nash appointed a commit
tee, consisting of Councilmen Meffert,
Mcl ver ,,andy ; Fausett, to investigate
the matted for the purpose of finding
out what might be done. The commit
tee will report back at the next meet
ing of counciL i " t
Mr.v Carmichael asked for lights at
Silver Springs. He - said if current
was furnished he would pay for i If
council ' did not see its way clear ' to
furnishing : current at ; this time, Mr.
armichael asked that he be permit
ted to use a small - exciter, which the
city is not now using, paying he would
install the same, and operate, it at his
own t expense, ; the exciter to remain
the . property of .the city Council
thought Mr. - Carmichael's request a
reasonable one. and on . motion ' of
Councilman Meffert ."permission was
given Mrr Carmichael to use the ex
citer on conditio!? .that it: remain the
property , of the city,' which reserves
the right to remove it at any time.

UREASE AUTOS
Results ia Decrease of Prices and an
Imperative Demand for
Good Roads
According to the New York Times
there is one automobile for every 25
persons in Jthe United States, and the
number of carsv is daily increasing.
The day is not far off when the auto
will be in reach of nearly everyone.
It is obvious, 'therefore, that good
roads must be built, and that the sec
tion of the country that does not build
good roadst will suffer accordingly.
The motorist will go many miles out
of the way in order to avoid ' bad
roads. In other words the motorist
will follow the line of least resistance,
not alone for the sake of comfort, but
for the sake of his car. Good roads
save wear and tear on any vehicle.
Following are some of the county
good roads bond issues in Florida, all
recent with the exceptio nof those in
Duval and Hillsborough counties :
Duval $1,000,000; St. Johns $600,
000; Volusia, ' $1,000,000; Brevard,
$450,000; St. Lucie, $300,000; Palm
Beach, $800,000; Dade, $1,000,000;
Hillsborough, ;; $1,000,000; Putnam,
$300,000; Seminole, $450,000; Orange,
$600,000 ; Palk, $1,500,000 ; , Taylor,
$600,000 ; Leon, $200,000. . . jO
Good roads are built, and are build
ing all down the East Coast of Flor
ida, and from the East Coast across
to Tampa The logical route to Tam
pa and South Florida fromthe north
i3 through Marion county. But with
first class roads down the East Coast
into South Florida the motorist will
travel that route, ancV-not- through
Central Florida ,unless Central Flor
ida puts itself on a footing with the
East Coast in the matter of high
ways. .Which means that a county
building good roads helps the adjoin
ing counties and, on the . contrary, a
county with "poor roads, between two
ore more counties having good roads,
injures those two or more counties. '
Marion county has at present 209
miles of hard-surfaced roads, and
certainly none of the county's trunk
roads are impassable. One never
hears of a car bogged up over night
in this county, as'js the case in other
counties and in other states. But.Marr
ion should be able to' compete with the
best. , .

CASH CAUSED I
COKTRQVERSY
Another Outbreak in the Council
Meeting Regarding Police
' Efficiency'
Mr. C. C. Cash, until , recently a
plain clothes man placed on the police
force at the instance of the mayor for
the purpose of running down "blind
tigers," was the subject of consider
able controversy before council last
night, following the . appearance be
fore that body of the mayor, who ask
ed that Mr. Cash be given a perma
nent position as a police officer. Mr.
Cash was present. A letter from
City Recorder Laurie T. Izlar was
read commending Mr. Cash as having
done, "more work since he had been
on the force than all the balance of
the force together."
President Nash appointed a com
mittee consisting of Councilmen Mc
Iver, Kinght and Meffert to investi
gate the records of the police court.
Mayor Robertson told council that
he thought Mr. Cash would make a
good policeman. The mayor said that
he differed with City Marshal Carter,
andvthought that another police of
ficer was needed. v
President Nash had read a letter
from the city recorder, Laurie T. Iz
lar, dated August 5, which was as
follows: -"Col.
George -A. Nash, President of
City Council, Ocala, Floridal
"Dear Sir: - In reply to your in
quiry as to theservices rendered by
C,C. Cash' as policeman, beg to say
that a. bare inspection of the docket
of the recorder's court .will answer
your inquiry very conclusively. -It
will show that Cash has done more
work since he has been on the force
than all of the balance of the force
together. He appears to ' me to be
more . vigilant and impartial in the
discharge of his duties than any man
we have had on the force for quite ai
while, and comes nearer earning his
wages. If the others were as watch-;
f ul and prompt 'in making arrests in
all cases "violated, we would in my
opinion soon have much less of com
plaint as to open violations of the
city's ordinances."
President Nash, fojlowing the . read
ing of the letter, told council that the
recorder had 'made many complaints
with regard to the police. At which
Councilman Meffert said that, that
being the case, the recorder should
prefer charges;
; President Nash thought that an
other policeman was needed, and fav
ored Mt. Cash." Councilman Knight,
chairman of the police committee of
council, said that he thought the city
had sufficient police; and stated that
if Mrl Cash were placed on the force,
one." of :. the further officers should go.
Referring to the recenta editorial in
the Star regarding the activities of
Mr. Cash as special policeman, Presi
dent Nash said that Mr. Cash said it
was absolutely false. - Councilman
Gerig thought the "bling tigers" were
noV familiar with Mr. Cash, and. his
usefulness in apprehending this law
less element therefore was gone.
Councilman Weathers thought it
shouid be explained that City Marshal
Carter had nothing personal , against
Mr. Cash, but was simply of the opin
ion that another policeman on the reg
ular force was not needed at this' time,
and ,ihat Mr. Cash, having become
known, had ceased to be useful In
capturing "tigers." Councilman Faus
ett wanted to kno wif there was any
special crime wave in the city to
bring about such a demand for an in
creased police force. Councilman
Meffert moved that the president of
council appoint a committee of three
to investigate the docket of the re
corder's court, the motion carried,
and President Nash appointed Coun
cilmen Mclver, Knight and Meffert. ;
Later in the evening, in answer tp
a question put by Councilman Meffert
regarding the instructions given the
police, City Marshal Carter, speaking
of the handling of traffic, in which it
had been said that Mr. Cash was es
pecially active, said that he did not
think the traffic laws were intended
to oppress anyone. Mr. Carter saia
that on one occasion Mr. tash arrest
ed an old negro hack driver for hav
ing his hack against the curb instead
of at an angle of 45 degrees, as pro
vided for in the Weathers ordinance.
The old negro, according to the mar
shal, had protested that he did not
know "nuthin' "bout no forty-five de
grees. President NasKlsaid that he
had seen several autos for hire stand
ins for hours agrainst the curb around
the courthouse square, and that no ar
rest had been made. Mr. Carter said
that he did not see the autos referred
to. He said that' a majority of the
people, and especially those from - out
of the city, were not familiar with the
traffic requirements. . Councilmen
Gerig and Fausett said that - they

TAX LEW WILL
PC
DC
ELEUE
City Council at Last Night's J lee ting
j Adopted the Budget Cor the
Ensuing Year
. The city tax levy for the fiscal year
of 1916-17 will be 11 mills. Council
last night adopted the budget prepar
ed by City Clerk Sistfunk without
change, except that Mr. Sistrunk's
suggestion, to let the profits from the
new plants take care of the retire
ment of the light and water bonds, as
the only means of making the levy
less than 13 mills, was agreed to.
With this exception the budget was
adopted unanimously, although Coun
cilman Moore had offered a substitute
budget, proposing, among other
things, to reduce the millage by rais
ing, the light and water rates. The
law "says that council shall provide a
sinking fund for the light and water
bonds, but council took the position
last night thatj it would be best to
take a chance on providing the sink
ing funds out of the profits of the
new plants, in view of the abnormal
conditions now obtaining. It was
pointed out that should the profits 'of
the plants fail to be sufficient" to pro
Vide the sinking funds, the funds
could be provided for later with a re
funding issue. This would not be the
best manner of . Drovidincr for the .
funds, it was said, but council felt
that it should take the chance so as to
give as much relief as possible from
heavy taxation.. .
The estimate for the street depart
ment is placed at $7550 as against
$8147 expended this year. Councilman
Mclver, chairman of the street com
mittee, stressed the importance of
having a sufficient f tnd to take care
of the streets, calling attention to the
fact the city this year did not have
enough money to keep the streets re
paired. Mr. Mclver was assured that
there would be enough money for this
purpose, his attention being called to
several items for the street depart
ment in this year's budget that would
not have to be provided for in the new
budget. A steam roller and a supply
.e L i.ti. :x At.r
Protesting against ihe proposal to
reduce the millage by increasing the
rates on light and, water, Councilman
Gerig said that it would not be at all
fair to make the few consumers bear
the burden of taxes that should be
borne by all. ,
In te budget proposed by . Mr. ,
Moore is recommended a reduction of
the expense of light for public use
from $4000 to, $2400; and Mr. Moore
says in this connection:
"I do not think the city ought to pay
more than 2 . cents for this electri
city furnished itself, and this is the
price which is charged to any largt
consumer of. electricity. The city certainly-ought
o supply itself with elec
tricity as cheaply as it supplies an
outsider."
"In -his budget Mr. Moore also re
duces tne nydrant rental irom izsoy
to $2400, "because from all the infor
mation I am able to obtain I do not
Heve that more than $2400 worth of
water per year is ever used through
our fire hydrants f or fire purposes. In
fact, I understand that in a great
many cities there is no charge made
for hydrant rental, even when the
water plant is privately owned."
With reference to money to be rais
ed for sinking fund and interest fund
for water works bonds and electric
light bonds, Mr. Moors says, "I do
not fhink it just, neither do I think it
good business to raise these funds
through geenral taxation. These
funds ought to be taken care of out
of electric light and water plants."
Mr. Moore made no fight for his
budget. He voted with the rest of the
council for the budsret prepared by
the city clerkT '
