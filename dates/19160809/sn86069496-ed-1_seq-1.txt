COLUMBIA, ADAIR COUNTY, KENTUCKY, WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 9, 1916.
NUMBER 41
A Paul Revere Ride.
How President will Come to Hodg
enville. Delightfully Entertained.
The Primary Election.
Enthusiasm was very much lacking
upon the part of Democrats and Re
publicans alike in the Congressional
primary election pulled off in the
Bighth distriot, last Saturday. Many
of the counties cast only a few votes.
In Adair county it was the lightest
vote ever polled in a primary in our
recollection, only a few hundred Dem
ocrats and a small number of Repub
licans participating. The county was
not canvassed, in person, by either
candidate, and they seemed to be as
little interested in Adair's vote as
tke voters manifested.
Mr. Helm, of Lincoln county, car
ried the county over Mr. Montgomery,
of Casey county, for the Democratic
nomination for Congress by about 188
votes, he having received 526 votes
and Montgomery 338. Montgomery
carried the three Columbia precincts
and also White Oak, Helm the rest of
the county
Hon. L. T Neat, the Republican
candidate for Congress, carried the
county by more than six hundred over
Dr Davidson, of Lincoln county, and
the returns from the other counties
in the district indicate that he ha
been nominated by a safe majority,
nbout seven hundred. He lost only
16 votes in this county.
Congressman Helm's majority is es
timated at 5,000 in the district. This
indicates that the Democrats of this
district are well pleased with our
congressman: that they propose to
give President Wilson the strongest
backing possible in the belief that
men, familiar with national affairs
should be re-elected. The battle cry
"It's a dangerous time to swap horses
while crossing the stream" meant that
Democrats proposed to back President
Wilson as best they could a tribute
to Mr. Helm, an enthusiastic endorse
ment of the President and open ev
idence of performing conscientious po
litical duty.
Merry-Go-Round.
The young people who want to en
joy themselves will have an opportu
nity during the Fair. A steam Merry-go-round
will be on the grounds,
one of the fastest in the State. Come,
every body, and take a ride.
Gentlemen, who are oflicing in the
second stories of buildings on the
square are requested not to throw slop
from their windows, as the waste is
very offensive to those who are em-'
ployed in rooms below. It is not only
offensive, but very injurious to health.
This is a matter that should engage
the attention of the health officer, and
very likely he has issued a warning
order, but it is not heeded.
Have you forgotten to call and set
tle your millinery bill? I need it now.
Mrs. George Staples.
A report reaches here that Mr A.
I. Hurt, a former Columbian, now a
citizen of Lafayette, Ind., is a victim
of cancer, the disease making its ap
pearance in his mouth, and that he
has been on the operating table. It is
hoped by his many Adair county
friends that the operation will prove
successful, and that he will be re
stored to health.

Fair.

The following aGt of little Louise
Grissom, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Grover Grissom. in a sense, was as
courageous as the ride made by Paul
Revere. Louise is seven years old,
and on the night of her adventure she
was at the home of her grandmother,
Mrs Rachel Grissom, in this place.
During the night her grandmother
was taken violently ill. There was
not a male person about the house,
and Mrs. Grissom wanted her son, Dr.
Garlin Grissom, who lives two miles
out on the Campbellsville pike He
was called by phone, but Louise
thought that he was too slow coming,
and without telling her grandmother
her intentions, she left the room at
eleven o'clock, went to the stable,
bridled a horse, mounted his bare baGk
and started for the home of her uncle,
but when she got in a half mile of the
doctor's residence she met him, deliv
ered her message, the two hurrying
together to the sick room. Do you
know of another seven year old girl, at
II o'clock at night, who would have
the courage that little Louise display

Louisville Hotel is the only hotel in
the city that offers the advantages of
the American and European plan.
Both are in the heart of the city in
the wholesale district, but convenient
to the most attractive retail streets.

conveniences of location when you
register at either of these hotels, but
the courtesies extended and the splen
did fare enjoyed will likewise appeal

ticular hotel test the correctness of
our statement and you will not have
cause for regret.

pleasantly, looking at fine stock and
hearing one of the finest bands that
ever went out of Louisville, come to
the Columbia Fair, August 15 and
put in four days
A-few-weeks ago wheat was selling
at around U per bushel, most of it
being sold a few cents higher. And
then the general prediction was that
there would be no advance on wheat
to amount to anything. Yet now
wheat is wavering around 81.20, with
prospects to get higher, as reports of
damaged crops come in from the
northwest Still it is not likely that
wheat will take the big jump this
year that it did last, though it is not
impossible.

attended the institute which was held

number of visitors, and many inter

flattering. Furthermore, there will
be more fine stock on exhibition than
