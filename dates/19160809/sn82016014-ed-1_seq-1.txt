Delegates of 400,000 Employes
Delay Calling Strike.
New York, Auk. 9. The threatened
strike of the 400.000 railway employes
of the T'nlted States was averted to
day when the railroad brotherhoods
acepted a proffer of the t'nlted Hates
hoard of mediation and conciliation to
mediate their differences with the
railroads.
Representatives of 400.000 train
men employed on 225 railroads of the
United States earlier today declared
they would not arbitrate demands for
an eight hour day and other conces
sions. Armed with power to call a
strike, tying up 250,000 miles of rail
ways, they said they would discuss the
questions Involved with railway offi
cials, but will not consent to calling an
an intermediary. Later, however,
they accepted the mediation plan.
This notice served upon the rail
way managers today by A. B. Garret
son, head i,f the conductors brother
hood, brought the situation between
the employes and employers to a
deadlock within an hour after the
first of '.heir scheduled conferences
'.vas called. Ellsha Lee. spokesman
for the railroad managers, declared
the railroads would Insist upon medi
ation. Board Offers Service.
Members of the federal mediation
and conciliation board are now here.
With the conference deadlocked, the
meeting broke up and the .-lilway
managers set out in search of the gov
ernment mediators. The brotherhood
officials went Into executive session.
Rlisha Lee formally invited the
United States board to offer its good
offices in reaching a settlement short
ly before noon today.
Members of the board, who are here:
at President Wilson's request, met and
framed a letter to the representatives
of the employes, asking that the de
mands be submitted to the board.
Judge Martin Knapp, chairman of
the board, said this afternoon a meet
ing of the representatives of the em
ployes and employers may be called
this evening. -
Oarretson said the employes would
meet with the board but are i.nwilllng
to Join the employers in asking for the
services of the mediators.
Arbitration Only Way Out.
Klisha Lee, chairman of the railroad
conference, in proposing that their
differences be mediated by the federal
hoard, called attention to the fact that
the brotherhoods had previously de
clined arbitration under th-? N'ewlands
act providing for six arbitrators, but
that the railroads saw no other way
out of their difficulties than through
mediation. Mr. Garretson. reiterating
the contention of the brotherhoods
that In previous attempts to settle dif
ferences with the railroad through the
federal boards, the brotherhoods had
failed to obtain satisfactory awards,
said that the unions believed they
could reach a settlement by dealing
directly with the roads.
"I believe," he said, "settlement of
our differences can be much better at
tained by dealing directly with you
without the Interference of a third
pnrty."
The reply of the railroads was de
livered by Ellsha G. Lee. of the Penn
sylvania. On behalf of the employe
A. B. Garretson. head of the conduc
tors' brotherhood, declined to accept
mediation, declaring the employes had
found arbitration unsatisfactory in
previous instances and furthermore,
that the two sides were in position to
confer directly without any inter
mediary. Lee responded that regardless of
the attitude taken by the employes,
the representatives of the railways
would artrmpt to enlist the services
of the federal mediation board.
Board Goo to New York.
New York. Aug. 9. Determined to
Bel their demands granted, and re
luctant to consider arbitration, repre
sentatives of more than 400,000 train
employes on more than 250.000 miles
of steam railways, met again todav
with a committee representing the
employers to learn what action would
bo taken as a result of the over
whelmingly strike vote announced
yesterday.
The determiner! stand of the em
ployes has brought all the members
of the Lnited States board of media
tion and conciliation to New York
watching every move. The board will
meet today to consider the situation
and will probably offer its services to
the employers and representatives of
the four brotherhoods oefore the ses
sion adjourns.
A. B. Oarretson. president of the
Order of Railway Conductors, before
the railroads' reply was made today
said. "No sane man would refuse me
diation," but his manner indicated
plainly that the employes would in
sist upon the original demands.
Unions Hold Conference.
Immediately following the reading
of the decision of the employers and
the reply of the employes, an execu
tive meeting of representatives of the
400.000 train employes was called to
consider the employers' stand.
Representatives of the employers,
headed by Elisha Lee, chairman of
the national conference of the rail
ways, started at once to find members
of the United States board of media
tion and conciliation and to present
their request for help to them per
sonally. At the close of the session
today Mr. Lee said that the employers
would seek mediation regardless of
the decision of the employes.
DeliTers Brief Speech With a
Real Punch in It.
REVIVAL OF AMERICANISM
Republican Standard Bearer
Sees It Everywhere.
Speaks in St. Paul and 3Iinne
apolis Late Today.
BY PERRY ARNOLD.
Winona, Minn., Aug. 9. Candidate
Hughes had his first tryout as a rear
platform campaigner in the presi
dential race today. It happened here
this morning when the Republican
standard bearer told a crowd of nearly
a thousand people that he looked for a
revival of the American spirit.
I The Minnesotans gave Hughes a
I rousing reception. As the train
i slowed up and came to a stop in the
station, the governor and Mrs. Hugr.es.
then Just finishing their breakfast,
hurried out on the platform. Mrs,
Hughes smiled and the governor
waved his hand.
The crowd yelled its approval. Then
the governor spoke. Here is his first
end of the train stump speech as a
presidential candidate:
"Good Morning!"
"Good morning. I am very glad to
have the opportunity of saying good
morning to you. The fact that you are
here at this hour shows the deep inter
est taken in the work of thiB cam
paign. I nave round, this Interest
j prevalent wherever I have gone and
j to me it is a very hopeful sign. It
' means that we want in this country a
revival or the true spirit. It means
that as we look to the future we want
to safeguard all the Interests of this
country by wise upbuilding policies. I
represent here a re-united Republican
party ready to meet these exigencies
aa they arise. I look forward to an
America tested as America has not
been tested before, when she has to
stand in the competitive strain that
will come when a new Europe issues
from this war. . And I desire that
north and south, east and west, every
part of this country, shall be benefited
by an administration that knows no
more partisan politics for the purpose
of paying political debts, but an ad
ministration that is devoted solely to
the upbuilding of this country and the
conservation of its vast interests. I
salute you."
Voice Slightly Hoarse.
When the governor concluded, for
mer Representative Jim Tawney,
whose home is In Winona, said he had
been told by the candidate to tell the
crowd that he was too tired to shake
hands. Hughes smilingly interrupted:.
"No," he interjected; "what I said
was that my voice was a little tired,
but I would be delighted to shake
hands with everybody here. I'm com
ing right down in the crowd now."
But at that moment the train start
ed and the governor had to hurry
back aboard after grasping only the
hands of a few of those nearest him.
Mr .Hughes' voice today was notice-
j ably hoarse, due to the effort of
speaking to the vast crowd last night
in Chicago.
In Twin Cities Today.
St. Paul. Aug. 9. Charles Evans
Hughes. Republican nominee for
president, is to deliver two addresses
in the Twin Cities late today. Arriv
ing here from Chicago shortly before
noon, he conferred with the Republle-
an state committee and left at 3: SO
o clock for Minneapolis, there to de
liver an address on the parade ground
at 6 o'clock.
He will return to St. Paul for din
ner and at 8:30 p. m. will speak at
the Auditorium here. He leaves for

Grain Market.
Chicago, Auk. 9- At tip top prices
of today's session of the board of
trpde, wheat showed an advance of
1 1 . cents a bushel over last night.
The market thruout the session gave
evidence of grreat tension owing to
millions of bushels in domestic crop

of disastrous further losses indicated
in Canada. The market closed ex

September at $1.44 H & 144 H and
December at $1.48 & 1.48
Wildness of Buying Is Record.
Wildness of buying by wheat trad
ers today exceeded any similar display
since the outbreak of the European
war. The majority of speculators here
had been decidedly incorrect regard
ing what the government report would
indicate and their belated efforts to
acquire holdings were made difficult
by like attempts on the part of for
eigners and by shorts who were caught
by the sudden upward whirl of the
market.
Despite lively profit taking the sup
ply of offerings in the wheat pit con
tinued inadequate to meet the demand.
Alarming reports as to a further
spread of black rust in Canada added
to the strength due to the immense
losses confirmed on this aide of the
international border. -

BY WIIUAM HOSTER.
Chicago, Aug. 9. About 10,000 peo
ple, crowded into the Coliseum here
last night, cheered for a full minute
this definition by Charles E. Hughus of
the paramount issue of the campaign:
"If anything in the campaign is real,"
he declared, "it is that we are now
facing the question whether we want
words, or whether we want deeds;
whether we want that which is writ
ten or spoken or whether we want
American action in the interests of
the American people, worthy of the
American name, maintaining the
American honor and buttressing the
prosperity of the United States."
Hughes, after another smashing
campaign day, mounted last night the
same platform from which he was
nominated for the presidency, fifty
eight days ago, and repeated his De
troit triumph of Monday night.
Once more he struck out with
force, scorn and derision at the per
sonal policies of President Wilson.
Tho a bit husky of voice, he held
the attention of the vast audienca for
a full hour, moving them first to
cheers and again to laughter by his
epigrammatic sallies.
Renews Mexico Assault.
He repeated his Mexican assault
and, in addition last night, opened a
new attack on the administration for
extravagance, pork barrel methods,
rejection of the budget system, raid
of the civil service law and using
diplomatic appointments to pay po
litical debts.
His speech bristled with epigrams
revealing Hughes in an entirely new
light
Ridiculing the Democratic tariff
policy, he cried: "You could no more
get a protective tariff out of a Demo
cratic congress, sectionaliy organized,
than-a revival sermon out of a disor
derly house."
He referred to Villa as "that emi
nent Sunday school scholar.
"I don't want any hot air in mine."
he declared in another place.
"We got into an ignominious war."
he said of the Vera Cruz affair, "and
we backed out ignominiously."
Promises Business Administration.
He promised a business like admin
istration if elected.
"We have somehow convinced the
world that our talk is cheap and
meaningless." he said.
"Let us have a new birth of Amer

NAMES MEX. CONFEREE
Secretary Lane and Justice Brandeis
Will Officiate on Board.
Washington, Aug. 9. Formal an
nouncement was made today by Acting
Secretary Polk of the acceptance of
General Carranza's proposal for a
joint International commission to seek
a solution of border disputes and to
discuss other matters which may help
clarify relations between the United
States and Mexico.
Only the time and place for the
conference reamin to be decided.
Secretary Lane of the interior depart
ment will head the American commis
sion supported by Associate Justice
Brandeis of the supreme court and a
third commissioner whose name will
be announced -later.
A telegram asking the third man
to serve was sent today by President
Wilson. The Mexican commissioners
were named some days ago, Luis Ca
brera, minister of finance in the Car
ranza. government, heading the dele
gation. This made necessary the ap
pointment of a member of President
Wilsons cabinet in the American
membership. Today's announcement
followed a brief conference between
Mr. Polk and Eliseo Arredondo, Car
ranza's ambassador designate. Assur
ances were given by Mr. Arredondo
that General Carranza was in com
plete accord with suggestions of the
Washington government that the dis
cussion of the commisioners be given
the broadest possible scope.
The ambassador said that his gov
ernment regarded its recent note as a
full answer of acceptance of Secre
tary Polk's suggestions that the scope
be broadened. As it begins its task,
the commission will be required first
to reach conclusions on the specific
points outlined by General Carranza
in his original proposal.
The first subject treated under this
view would be the withdrawal of
American troops from Mexico, to be
followed by negotiations of a protocol
covering future military operations
along the border
Faulty More on State's Part
Would Be Fatal Now.
REDUCE MINIMUM TO 50 CENTS
Ready to Hake Decrease for the
Cause of Peace.
Conference With Attorney Gen
eral Failed in Its Mission.
Too much interference on the part
of Joseph L. Bristow and the public
utilities commission is blocking a com
promise in the gas rate case, according
to rumors in the state house. If Bris
tow and the commission will agree to
Quit playing football with the gas rate
case, the minimum charge will be re
duced to 60 cents, according to re
ports. In short, the 100 per cent increase
in the gas minimum is the pawn which
the gas company is willing to sacrifice
for peace. For five years the gas
company has been almost constantly
before the public utilities commission.
With the coming of Joseph L. Bristow
to the chairmanship of the commis
sion and his probable desire to return
to the United States senate, it is the
belief of gas company officials that
their troubles have multiplied. To be
sure gas rates have gone up, but the
gas rate case and the passenger rate
case have been the two prize punch
ing bags in the Bristow gymnasium.
Willing to Compromise.
Reports In Topeka this week are to
the effect that the Kansas Natural
Gas company will compromise for the
sake of peace. But if forced to fight,
they will stand on the ruling of the
federal court and insist on the (t
minimum and the 36-cent flat rate.
In short if Bristow and the utilities
commission insist on trouble, the Gas
company will accommodate them.
And while the battle is before Bristow
and the commission the public will
pay the bill In increased rates.
There is a report in Topeka todav
to the effect that the proposition of
an agreement - in the - gas caan was
checked up to ' Bristow biU .without
success. The commission chairman is
said to have refused to compromise
except on his own. terms.
The conference this week between
S. M. Brewster, attorney general, and
representatives of the Gas company
failed to result in a decision. - Another
conference is to be held. There is a
growing impression that the Gas com
pany may consent to return to the
50-cer.t minimum and might go so
far as to reduce its flat rate on gas.
But no agreement will be made, it is
reported, unless Bristow and the util
ities commission approve the action.
And in the freely expressed opinion
of the Gas company officials and rep
resentatives, this approval Is being
withheld
J. M. THURSTON DEAD
FTormer U. S. Senator From Nebraska
