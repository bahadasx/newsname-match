I'resident Wilson decided that lie
would make no move toward prevent

ence committee of managers and the
representatives of the railway broth
erhoods, meeting in New York on
Aug. 8, was unable to harmonize the
differences growing out of the d"
mnnd.s of the brotherhoods. President
Wilson's deep interest in the effort to
prevent the big strike was indicated
when he sent for Judge William, L.
Chambers, commissioner of the board
of mediation and conciliation, and
asked him to explain the situation in
detail. The two other members of

W. A. BROOKS OF OKLAHOMA
CITY PURCHASES ENTIRE ISSUE
OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTY
THOUSAND DOLLARS.
The bonds recently voted by the
city for one hundred and thirty thou
sand dollars for public improvements
were purchased by W. A. Brooks of
Oklahoma City. The bonds brought
par and accrued interest, the pur
chaser agreeing to pay nil expenses
cf the bond issue.
Sixty thousand dollars of this
amount will be used for purchasing
the site and erecting the convention
hall at the corner of Broadway and
C streets, northwest. The balance will
be used for extending the water and
sewer mains of the city and other
necessary improvements.
The people of the city are very
anxious to see work in all departments
begin, i specially the work on the con
vention hall.
Ardmore has long needed such a
structure. The city has been denied
many pleasures because there was no
place where the public could be at
tracted. The Lyceum Course of Ard
more has been practically dead for
two years, on this account, and there
is a general feeling that everything
will be changed when there is a hall
of sufficient size that the public can
be accommodated at popular prices.
The water and sewer extensions
are absolutely necessary. If building
is to be extended, as cottages are
already erected far beyond the pres
ent limits.

LACK OF TRANSPORTATION
INTC.RURBAN WOULD SOLVE
PRODLEM.
W. P. Beard, who owns extensive
mining interests in the Arbuckle
mountains, was in the city today and
states that activities in the mines
have slackened to pome extent within
the past few weeks, although the
Itobinett mine is getting out approxi
mately five tons of ore daily.
Mr. Board says that the one great
thins lacking in the development of
the mines in the Arbuekles is a means
of transportation. With an interurban
road connecting with the field he says
things in the Arbuekles would pick
up raphlb' and a new town would soon
he established.
Mr. IVard has long urged capital
to take lrild of this proposition, and
s:ys he is willing to divide his hold
ings, which nre extensive, with any
one who will promote an interurban
railway.
TEUTONS BEING GIVEN
FINAL BLOW IN AFRICA
London. Aug. 8. General Louis
Botha, premier of the Union fit
South Africa, has arrived in German
Hast Africa to witness what is believ
ed probably the last phase of the
operations against Germany's one re
maining colony. General Botha was
present at the recent fighting north
of the German Central railway, which
resulted In a British advance to and
occupation of the lines at Kllimatinde
and other points.
Meanwhile, with the occupation of
I jijl by the Belgians and of Sadanl
and other coast ports by the British,
the Germans apparently are afforded
! only the opportunity of retreating Into
'the southeastern cornrr of the colony
1 where the Portuguese, in their East
! African possession, are awaiting them.

LIMIT PASSED ON STORAGE CA
PACITY 4,C00 MORE CARS ARE
NEEDED TROUBLE CAUSED
IN EAST.
.Oklahoma City, Aug. 8. Although
the wheat market has continued high
for the past week, the movement of
Oklahoma grain has fallen off consid
erably since the big rise in prices
came. Grain buyers of Oklahoma
City say this Is due partly to the fact
that cars cannot bo had fast enough
and partly to the belief that the wheat
is hound to go very much higher be
fore winter.
The car shortage has become very
serious recently. Reports have been'
coming In to local offices that in sonio
sections of the state buyers have been
piling the grain on the ground. This
has boon clone In the Alfalfa county
towns, more than any other place.
Klevators in many towns have shut
their doors and are refusing to take
the grain except on contract for fu
ture delivery.
4,000 Cart Needed.
It is estimated that 4,000 more cars
are needed to handle the Oklahoma
crop than are available now.
That the problem of getting freight
cars to carry the grain Is more ser
ious than ever before was the opin
ion expressed yesterday by L. C. Wil
liams of Wichita. Kan. Mr. Williams
is commercial agent for a railroad.
"Some railroads are denying that a
shortage In cars exists, but there Is
no dodging the question," Mr. Wil
liams said. "How long It will last Is
uncertain, but it Is safe to say that
very few more cars than are now In
use over the western lines will bo
get free wit! 'n sixty days.
Cause Traceable to East.
"The trouMe comes from the f.v.t
that so many cars are bein? ueJ es
i warehouses In th cat. Terminal fa
cillties are filled to the bursting
point. The movement of war r-ipidics
has taken up all the ship room and
other lines have had to wait. Count-
I less thousands of tons of al! manufac
ture goods are stored In the ware
houses, and these not being large
enough, goods have been left in the
cars which carried them to the cast."
J. B. S.-vraciB and Ben Stephens
left today for Tituni. Homer and
PooleviNe. Mr. Spraglrs fcai evpral
farm in that portion of the county
and he goes to look after crop prospects.
