Republican Nominee Again Assails
Vigorously the Present Admin*
istration.
CLAIMS DEMOCRATS
NEVER HAD A POLICY
Candidate Stands For "Business-like
Responsible Budget and No
Hot Air."
ENTERS STATE TOMORROW.
Charles Evans Hughes, the Re­
publican presidential nominee,
will arrive in North Dakota to­
morrow morning, speaking at
Grand Forks and Fargo. Friday
he resumes his trip westward,
stopping enroute to Montana at
Valley City, Jamestown, Bis­
marck, Mandan and Dickinson.
Local plans are going forward
nicely under the direction of W.
J. Prater, chairman of the Bur­
leigh county Republican commit­
tee, who will introduce Mr.
Hughes. Grand Forks and Fargo
are making elaborate prepara­
tions for the reception of the
nominee.
Chicago, (Aug. 8.—Charles E. Hughes
tonight told an audience that crowded
Chicago's great coliseum, the 'hall
where he was nominated, what he
would do if elected president of the
United States.
Mr. Hughes said, the present admin­
istration waB waste extravagance and
vacillation. He declared that it had
not kept the country out of war, but
that it had fought an ignominous war
in Mexico and had withdrawn from
that war ignominously. He said the
administration which, having brought
the country much nearer to participa­
tion in the European war than the
country would have been, had the
administration "stood for American
rights."
Me declares that it was no more
possible to expect tariff protection to
American industries from -a Demo­
cratic cpngress than it w'ould be to
get "a revival sermon out of a dis­
orderly house."
ThQ,,p9?mnee, assailed the adminis­
tration'ipr appointment to offices and
declared ,tWt, if elected, he would ap
1 point to,! office only men who were
qualified.'
Attacks Navy Expenditures.
Democratic expenditures for rivers
and harbors were attacked by the
nominee.
"I proposed that we shall stop this
coarse business," he said. "I propose
that we shall have government in a
business-like way. We won't have
anymore, if I can stop it, of these,
'Kiss me and I'll kiss you' appropria­
tions in congress.
The nominee said he stood for a
"business-like responsible budget"
based on facts.
"I don't want any hot air in mine,'
he added.
Approaching Protective Tariff.
The.'Democratic party, Mr.. Hughes
said, was approaching the idea of a
protective tariff, "like a skittish horse
to a brass band." "In 1912," he add­
ed, "the Democratic platform said in
effect that a 'protective tariff was un­
constitutional.
"They say in effect now that the
European war has changed the con­
stitution of: the United States," he
continued, "but do you think they are
converted? Don't you trust them, a
little, .^inute |Wi,th protecting Ameri
can industry. They haven't got it in
their bones.
"All through the administration's
policy," Mr. Hughes said," "we have
allowed our word to be eaten up by
hesitation—by delay. We have some
how or other convinced the world
our talk is cheap.
"I propose that we have a new birth
of American purpose and courage. We
have no occasion to fear war in the
assertion of those rights, which all
the world will recognize and only hon­
or and respect us for so doing."
The Mexican Situation.
Speaking of the Mexican situation,
Mr. Hughes said: If the administra­
tion had, at the outset, said to Huerta
'we will, recognize, you if you can per­
form your international obligations, if
you have got a real government that
can discharge its duties,— we won't
recognize unless we are satisfied that
you have. But there is one thing
that you and everybody else must un­
derstand and that is this, American
lights and the privileges of American
citizens in Mexico must -be protected
and we will see to it*
"That was the straight and correct
policy. That was the one thing that
•the administration ought to have done
and the one thing that it could not do.
"When men, who had been deserted
by their government when our war­
ships left San Pedro, and allowed
British and German warships to res­
cue our own people—think of it, when
we had run away,— when one of the
officers was asked about it, what do
you suppose he said? He replied:
'You went down there to make money,
didn't you?*

presentatives of this government dar

Notable Gains Recorded in Main
Theater* Against teutonic
Forces.
ITALIANS TAKE THE
GORIZIA BRIDGE-HEAD
Russians Continue Westward Drive
Aggressively in East Galicia,
Near Stanislau.
The -Entente allies in the main
theaters of the war have made addi­
tional notable gains against the Teu­
tonic allies. Big advances for them
in East Galicia and along the eastern
Italian front are recorded in the lat­
est communicatiep^Tfefeued by the
French, Russian, and Italian war of­
fices.
The French, have taken German
trenches three arid three-quarters
miles in length aq| from 300 to 500
meters in deptlj'Iii the last few days
have again vm a foothold in the
Thiaumont works, near Verdun, and
captured two iines of German trench­
es on the Baux Chenois front. The
British in the Somme region, near
Guillemop, have advanced about 400
yards.
Continue Drive.
The Russians are continuing to
drive their wedge westward in East
Galicia, near Stanislau. They have
taken some half dozen additional
towns and villages, according to Pet
rograd. Territory amounting to 61%
square miles has been captured and
the pursuit of the Austro-Germans
continues, the Russians claim.
Vienna admits that the Austrians
have been withdrawn to the region
west of Tlumach in the face of super
ior forces.
Take Bridehead.
The Gorizia bridge-head, the key to
an advance to Toriest, over which the
Austrians and Italians have fought
many battles, has at last fallen to the
Italians and the city of Gorizia is be­
ing shelled. The taking of the bridge­
head came with the (fapture o{ Monte
Sabo^inonftn^'^^iiite-StwMie^. The
Italians took nror'e fcftanf,0$0 jprt'son
ers and a large number of guns, ma*
chine guns and a quantity of war ma­
terial.
The Allies admit that the Austrian
troops defending the bridgehead were
withdrawn to the eastern Isonzo in
order to avoid severe losses, but says
the fighting in the Gorizia region con­
tinues with unabated stubbornness
and that the Austrians have repulsed
several Italian attacks.

Martin A. Knapp, the third member

Under the law, the board is not
authorized to offer its services until

necessary, but in view of the magni­

said tonight that an offer to mediate

Gympers 'lihd
made public here tonight. ,•
When all efforts fall for mediation
or arbitration of the threatened strike
of 400,000 railroad men for the eight
hour day, everybody in .Washington
who knows a thing about it .predicts
that President Wilson will step
sonally into the crisis to "avert a na­
tional tie up of transportation.
He will invite both parties to Wash*
ington and endeavor to Bettle the cen^
troversy through the department of
labor, is the opinion here.
v°
Wilson called the department of
labor into the Colorado strike, but the
corporations refused to meet with tbe
men. Then came the Ludlow -ipasssr
ere, and tLe federal troops.
Tremendous business pressure
Is
being exerted throughout the land to
force the railroad men to accept arbi­
tration.
W. S. Carter, .president of the
Loco­
motive Firemen, has declared the de­
mands cannot be arbitrated.
But the men in Washington who
will have to handle the situation ex­
pect the government board of media­
tion and conciliation, created under
the Newlands act, will be called into
the case. Tbe railroads will undoubt­
edly make the request, and the men
will agree.
Judge Martin A. Knapp and Jude
William L. Chambers constitute the
board.
Unofficially, it is admitted by
all
concerned that efforts at mediation
will be unsuccessful.
Under the law it then becomes tho
duty of the board to induce the two
parties to submit to arbitration.
Railroads are anxious for arbitra­
tion the. men are averse. Past art*
trations hove gone against them, they
contend.
The result of the strike
vote taken
by the employes the past
month wasi
presented to the national
oonferenee
and Showed
an overwhelming majority
was
favor of authorizing the
agreed to adjourn until
