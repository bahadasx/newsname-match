Fires Aglow.
ItEFL'SH HUGHES INDORSEMENT
Indianapolis. Ind.i Aug. 4. Tlio
Progressive party will not have a
national ticket in the Held this year.
This was decided here at the con
ference of Progressive leaders from
many States of the country.
Hut the party and the cause will
not be permitted to die. Plans for
Tcorganlzatlon and perpetuation of
tho party were adopted.
An Executive Committee of 13
Members, named by Matthew Hale,
of Boston, Acting Chairman of the
National Committee, will co-operato
with the 15 members of the Natlm
al Committee who recused to vole
for the indorsement of Charles E.
Hughes at Chicago, June 2C, In re
habilitation work. J. A. II. Hop
kins, or New Jersey, was mimed
Treasurer of the new organization.
The conference, after a heated dis
cussion, decided that it would be
impracticable at this late date to
Teassemble the national convention
and fill the vacancy on the national
ticket caused by 'Theodore ,Roose
velt'b declination of the nomination
for President, l
Instead, tho organization will put
up an Electoral ticket In every State
"where there is the nucleus bf an
organization .lefLbearlng the namo
of John M." Parker, of Louisiana,
nominee for Vice President, in the
hope of perhaps electing enough
Presidential Electors, ' who might
prove to be the balance of power lu
the event of a close icontest between
trie two parties.
Among the States in which this
plan will be i carried out are Louis
iana, Maryland, Indiana, Missouri,
Wisconsin, Michigan. Utah, North
Dakota and Minnesota.
The comniittee'of fifteen will meet
after the November elections to for
mujate plans for the. perpetuation of
fae party. These plans may Include
some kind of an amalgamation with
the Prohibition, Socialist and Wom
an's parties.
Six of the 15 were chosen here.
They are Edward 'M. Lee, of Indian
apolis, Chairman: A. D. Norton, of
St. Louis, Mo.: Charles P. Hoffman,
of Jackson, Mich.; Howell Molse, of
.New Orleans, La., and C.L. McClure,
of' Atlanta. Ga. The remaining nine
members are to be appointed by Mr.
Hale within the next week.
Th,e rflnal act of the conference
"wps passage of a resolution calling
upon the National Committee to
turn alf fund3 over to Hopkins, the
new; treasurer.
At the afternoon session the con
ference adopted a, ringing resolution
repudiating the indorsement of
Hughes's candidacy by the National
Committee' in Chicago.
It- waB on John M. Parker's sug
gestion that tho Progressives decided
to mako,a fight in only a few States.
Mr. Parker was cheered lustily
when ho addressed the conference.
He said:
"In tho paBt It was charged that
wo were controlled by two men, one
as-leader, and tho other was credit
ed with buyiug us. Thank God no
hody owns tho Progressive party to
day." Mr. Parker reviewed the history
of the party, praised the platform
-adopted at the national convention
last Juno and urged that steps bo
taken to perpetuate the party. Ho
tseverely criticised the National Com
mittee for Indorsing Hughes. x
The action of tho old National
'tfommltteo In Indorsing the candida
cy of Hughes was repudiated in al
most bitter terms. A resolution,
which carried a stinging' rebuke of
Infraction of the National Commit
tee, was passed amid loud cheerlug
shortly aftor tho opening of the af
ternoon session. The conference as
serted that the action was taken
without authority from the members (
of the party, and took the position
that the entire, indorsement of
Hughes was without authority.
About 75 active participants and
hundreds of spectators were In the
convention room when the meeting
was called to order. Seventeen
States, chiefly Central and Southern,
were represented, with New York;
New Jersey and Massachusetts in
the East.

Destioyed.
Central City, Ky., Aug. 7. Dam
age to the amount of $25,000 was
caused by a lire early .yesterday
morning which destroyed the tipple
of the Central Coal & Iron Company,
the only concern which is operating
a mine here. Shelby filsh, manager
of tho company, expressed the opin
ion that the place was set 011 lire.
Ho said that two men had been seen
In the immediate vicinity of tho tip
ple shortly before the lire was dis
covered and, though they were not
recognized, efforts will be made to
identify them In order that warrants
may be secured for their arrest.
More than 250 men will be with
out work for at least sixty days, as
it will take that long to rebuild the
tipple and the machinery, which was
either damaged or destroyed.
There has ,ben considerable ill
teeling In Muhlenberg county against
the Central Coal k. Iron Company, It
was stated.
The mine at Central City, on
account of the necessity for contin
uing operations to fulfill coaling
contracts with the Illinois Central
railway, had been navlng the scale ,
demanded by tho strikers. It was 1

the fire was incendiary and much

The Hustler reporter has learned
from the bojs that have just relum

one at Ft. Thomas has settled down
to enjoy life while waiting lor the
"boys they left behind them" to fill
up the ranks made thin by the
"shots" of the medical examiners.
Lieut. Sory states that Ilrlg. (leu

ing the First Drlgade, has already
received an order from tlie War De

five men to each company. Tho
Kentucky brigade will ro to the bor
