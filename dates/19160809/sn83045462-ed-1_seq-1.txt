PROMPT ACTION IS DESIRED
Pointed Out That Previous Attempts
to Adjust Differences Had
Not Been Satisfactory
to Workers.
NEW YORK, August 9.?The
threatened strike of the 400,000
railway employes of the United
States was averted today when
the railroad brotherhoods accepted
a proffer of the United
States board of mediation and
conciliation to mediate their differences
with the railroads.
Announcement of the acceptance
of the offer was made by
A. B. Garretson, head of the
conductors* brotherhood, after it
had been delivered by G. W. W.
Hanger, a member of the board,
following an appeal to that body
to intervene, made today by the
national conference of railroad
managers.
Mr. Garretson said he had informed
the board that the offer
was accepted on the condition
that "its good offices are promptly
exercised."
After the delivery of the brotherhoods'
MQtptaan of the offer the fedorml
board, the mediators, made arrangements
to confer with the railroad
managers this afternoon.
Beady to Act at Once.
The federal board, which Is composed
of Mr. Hanger. Martin A. Knapp and
Judge W. L. Chambers, was prepared to
begin conferences with the respective
sides to the controversy before night,
it was understood, although at the time
of Mr. Garretson's announcement the
board had not been officially informed
of the acceptance.
"The federal board of mediation and
conciliation has notified us." read Mr.
Garretson's statement, "that it has received
the request of the managers'
conference committee to exercise its
friendly offices in an effort to bring
about an amicable settlement of the
questions that exist between the conference
committee of the managers and
ourselves. Our answer was to the effect
that we would accept the mediators'
proffer of their friendly offices
provided it was promptly exercised."
The procedure of the federal board is
to meet each side separately, learn
their attitudes and attempt to obtain
concessions from each as a basis on
which a settlement can be reached
when they are again brought together.
Beject Men's Demands.
The national conference of railroad
managers today rejected the men's demands
and proposed that they be mediated
by the federal tribunal. The
brotherhoods refusing to join In an appeal
to the tribunal, the railroads made
an individual appeal. The federal
board, which is in session here, then offered
its services to the brotherhoods
and were at noon awaiting their reply.
The indications were at this time
that the reply would be favorable.

mv viau naj vuu
Elisha Lee, chairman of the railroad
conference. In proposing that their differences
be mediated by the federal board
directed attention to the fact that the
brotherhoods had previously declined arbitration
under the Newlands act, providing
for six arbitrators, but that the
railroad* saw no other way out of their
differences than through mediation.
Mr. Garretson, reiterating the contention
of the brotherhoods that In previous attempts
to settle differences with the railroads
through the federal boards the
brotherhoods had failed to obtain satisfactory
awards, said that the unions believed
they could reach a settlement by
dealing directly with the roads.
"I believe," he said, "settlement of our
differences can be much better attained
by dealing directly with you without the
interference of a third party."

Will Reply to Board.
Chairman Lee then ann&unced that he
would nevertheless appeal to the federal
board of mediation and conciliation
This board was at this time in
session at a nearby hotel. Mr. Lee's
announcement came after Mr. Garretson
had expressed his willingness to
have ;he railroads make the appeal. In
that event, he said, the unions could

Meantime it was stated the board
would remain in session to await the
brotherhoods' reply.

Both sides, after adjournment, went
into executive session.
Mr. Garretson explained to newspaper
men that the unions had not declined
mediation unequivocally, but
had refused to Join with the railroads

TO MSB IE
Minority Report Denies Demand
Here for Municipal
Ownershin nf Railwavs.
FILED BY MR. JOHNSON
OF DISTRICT COMMITTEE
Argument Used That W. It. and E.
Co. Is Not Earning a
Dividend.
On the ground that there is absolutely
no demand for municipal ownership of
street railways in the District of Columbia,
a minority report on the Crosser bill
was filed today in the House by Chairman
Johnson of the District committee. The
Crosser bill, reported again favorably in
the present Congress, provides for the
purchase of street railways by the District
government, to be paid for by a bond
Issue. The minority report filed today is
el duplicate of the minority report filed
In the last Congress, to which is attached
el supplemental etatement written by
Representative Johnson and signed by
himself and Representatives Oakey, Ragsiale,
Darrow, Gould, Focht, Wilson and
Tinkham.
Representative Johnson uses for ammunition
for one of his main points
the statement by Corporation Counsel
Syme th'at the Washington Railway
and Electric Company had not earned
a. dividend in seven years:
"If the Washington Railway and
Electric Company," says the minority
report filed today, "has not earned a
dividend during the last seven years
then it seems conclusive to us that it
would be a bad proposition for the
District of Columbia to tax the people
to take over a company which is losing
money under the favorable circumBtances
set out by the proponents of
the bill. It would be a bad proposition
for any other city to deliberately set
out to acquire a public utility which
the proponents of the measure themselves
assert is a losing proposition,
and it would be worse for the District
of Columbia under all the circumstances
which have been set out to do
so."
No Demand, Says Report.
The report also reminds Congress
that it would be an extraordinary
thing to impose a fifty-million bond
issue upon the people of the community
without a referendum. Leading up in
this way to the fact that the committee
has been unable to discover any public
demand for municipal ownership, the
?? ??* -." -o a "lAfliiinfl*
citizen" who made the statement that
there was an overwhelming: demand
for tmxntctim.1 ownership was unable to
give the names of over two dozen persons
who had ever spoken to him in favor
of the subject.
"It must be borne in mind that the
bill does not propose to take over any
public utility except the street railways,
and they are without motive
power," says the report. "All of the
street car companies in the District of
Columbia, except one, purchase their
motive power from a separate electric
power company. Therefore, if the railroads
were taken over by the District
of Columbia they would have to buy
their power from the electric company
referred to."
Not Owned by New Orleans.
Chairman Johnson, in his statement,
calls attention to the fact that in
the previous report favoring- the Grosser
bill the statement was made that
the city of New Orleans had found
municipal ownership of railways advantageous,
and that it has been since
demonstrated that New Orleans does
not have municipal ownership at all.
"It is regretted," says the Johnson
statement, "that the report filed in the
present Congress reiterates the former
statement as to New Orleans, notwithstanding
the fact that those who prepared
the report know that New Or- 1
leans did not own the street railways." 1

ST. PAUL, August 9.?A. B. Stickney, ,
founder of the Chicago Great Western
railroad, died at his home here this !
morning, after an illness of four weeks.
He had been in declining health for
several years. .Members of the family
and a number of friends were at the
bedside when the end came. Intestinal
trouble with complications was given
as the c^use of death by attending
physicians.
Mr. Stickney. who was seventy-six
years old, was born and educated in j
Maine, and later came to the north- j
west, where* he organized the Chicago j
Great Western Railway Company. He
also was builder of branch lines of sev- j
eral other roads. Illness in 1908 caused
his resignation as president of the Chicago
Great Western.
Mr. Stickney took part in many activities
to promote the commercial, social
and educational welfare of the
northwest. One of his "commercial projests
resulted in the founding of the St.

PEACE SENTIMENT
GROWSINEUROPE
Miss Emily G. Balch, Delegate
to Neutral Conference, Talks
With President en Subject.
Miss Emily G. Balch, the sole remaining
delegate from the United
States to the neutral conference for
continuous mediation, with headquarters
In Stockholm, Sweden, spent some
time with President Wilson today telling
him of the continuous efforts of the
conference to arouse peace sentiment
among the belligerent nations of Europe
and of the prospects for peace, as
she sees them.
Miss Balch, before going to Europe on
the Henry Ford peace ship, was professor
of economics at Wellesley College,
and when Mr. Ford decided upon
establishing a continuous conference
of neutral nations in Europe she was
one of the two delegates selected to
represent America, the other being Dr.
Charles F. Aked, who resigned some
time ago because things were not going
to suit him.
Value of President's Speech.
Miss Balch said that President Wilson's
speech at Charlotte, N. C.f in May
last had done much good for peace in
Europe, and that peace sentiment is
growing in all the nations there. Public
opinion in Germany, Miss Balch
said today, shows a stronger tendency
toward peace than in any of the other
belligerent nations. She did not attribute
this to signs of collapse, but
to the fact that the German people
are thinking hard.
Miss Balch believes that Sweden
?vould have joined the central powers
against the allies but for the continuous
conference and the rapidly devel- j
oping peace sentiment.
"There has been a great sweep of
peace sentiment in the Scandinavian
countries," Miss Balch said. "The peo- i
pie in these countries are close to the
volcano and know what war means."
Not Optimistic as to Peace.
Miss Balch, who returned to this j
country last month and expects to leave
for Stockholm within about two weeks,
was not so optimistic as to peace.
"I hope to S3e peace negotiations
started this fall or winter," she said. 1
"The opinion is growing among the j
belligerents that the terms of peace :
will be no' better two years from now J
than they would be now, and that may j
have the effect of bringing them to- i
gether sooner than expected. I do not i
base my conclusions on the idea that i
any of the countries are nearing exhaustion
and will be unable to fight
longer, but largely upon the fact that
reason may assert itself and point out
that nothing is to be gained by either
side prolonging the war. The terms
each will demand are not so far apart,
after all, and are likely to be just about
the same next year as this year."
West Virginia's Big Output of Coal.
CHARLESTON. W. Va., August 9.?
West Virginia produced 80,000,000 net
tons of coal during the year which

Just made publi? by Earl Henry, chief
of the state department of mines. This
Is the greatest amount produced in the
history of the state, the report says.
Allies Limit Greek Imports.
ATHENS. August 8. via London. August
9.?Representatives at Athens of
the entente allies advised the Greek
govertlment today that importations of
food stuffs and fuel hereafter must be
limited to the following amounts
monthly: Flour and wheat, 36,000 tons;
corn, 3,000 tons; sugar, 2,000 tons; coal,
25,000 tons; rice, 17,000 sacks. Importation
of coffee is prohibited, as the
stock on hand in Greece is considered
sufficient.

HUGHES TIRED BY
STRENUOUS WORK
Makes Only One Platform
Talk on the Trip From Chicago
to St. Paul.
ST. PAUL, Minn., August 9.?The
strain of unaccustomed campaigning
lad told upon Charles E. Hughes when
le reached here today. He was fatigued
and his voice was hoarse. The
:hroat specialist accompanying him
urged him to save his voice for the
rwin City meetings, and Mr. Hughes
consequently refrained except in one
nstance from making back-platform
speeches at Ave ^cheduled stops in
Minnesota before reaching this city.
At Winona, Minn., Mr. Hughes made
l three-minute talk with his wife
standing beside him. He expressed
gratification in the interest of the
crowd which had brought them so
early to the station, and^continued:
Public Interest Hopeful Sign.
"I have found this interest prevalent
wherever I have gone and to me it is a
rery hopeful sign.
"It means that we want in this country
l revival of the true American spirit. It
neans that as we look to the future we
want to safeguard all the interests of this
:ountry by wise upbuilding and policies.
"I represent here a reunited republican
party ready to meet these exigencies
as they arise.
"I look forward to an America tested
is America has not been tested before,
when she has to stand in the competitive
strain that will come when a new
Europe issues from this war. And I
iesire that north and south, east and
west, every part of this country shall
be benefited by an administration that
knows no mere partisan policies for
the purpose of paying political debts,
but an administration that is devoted
solely to the upbuilding of this country
ind the conservation of i.s vast interests.'"
Declines Comment on Telegram.
Mr. Hughes declined today to comment
>n the telegram sent him yesterday by
Acting Secretary Sweet of the Departnent
of Commerce, denying charges
nade in the nominee's Detroit speech
vith reference to the retirement of E.
)ana Durand of the census bureau, and i
in "eminent scientist" of the coast and I

erted, had been displaced by "an excel- !
ent stock-breeder and veterinary surreon."

CHICAGO,/ 111., August 9.?
Success appears thus far to be attending
the main object of Candidate
Hughes' western trip, which
is to get acquainted with the people,
let them get an impression of
him and start the ball rolling in
the republican national campaign.
On this journey he will not expend
his heaviest campaign ammunition
and oratorical effort,
but reserve the columbiads for
succeeding trips west. Moreover,
he is rather "feeling them
I 11 *
uul diiu 1a.iK.1ng exiemporaneously.
He has prepared nothing
in advance, but speaks right off
the reel.
This policy has given cause for complacency
to the democrats, who were
al. curiosity to know with what kind
of music he would open the ball. They
say he has not set the rivers on fire
yet, which Is quite true up to date
and probably will continue to be the
case.
Forced to Counteract Impressions.
When Mr. Hughes entered the west
he found himself facing: the necessity
of removing: two impressions prevailing:
to a more or less degree. One was the
feeling among the populace that he was
a cold and austere man, clothed with
an atmosphere of judicial aloofness
from the man in the street, through
his service on the bench. The other
was a feeling among the party workers
that he would prove distant and in
a measure unapproachable to them and
out of sympathy with the practical politicians.
No doubt the impression In the one
case and the apprehension in the other
were accentuated by the course he
so rigorously pursued prior to the nomination,
in keeping out of politics. H*
made a fine running start at Detroit,
keeping up the pace here, in dissipating
the first mis judgment of his temperment,
and in Chicago in the all-day
conferences with big fry and small
fry politicians, he effectually removed
any feaia in their minds that he did
not know the political game and how
to get along with "the boys."
At Detroit he walked right into the
hearts of the big crowds that thronged
around him. His manner, free and unaffected,
cordial, and friendly, caught
them at once. He did not have to affect
anything, for he really is a magnetic
man when he turns himself loose,
as those who met him in the campaign
of 1908 remember.
Called "Regular Feller."
His service on the bench has not
changed him, apparently. In fact, there
was no doubt that he was in his element
as a mixer, and he enjoys it. One
man in Detroit remarked, "Why, he is
a regular feller. I don't believe he was
a good Supreme Court judge, as a matter
of fact."
In his main speech in Detroit he
started out feeling his way, with intuitive
realization when he was not
warming his audience up. His talk
about efficiency and experience in public
service, while it may read flat in
print, was addressed to audiences of
manufacturers and workingmen who
work by rule of thumb, with mathematical
precision, where they have to
turn out the products flawlessly and
where bungling shows immediately in
cost. That caught them. When he
found they were not interested in padding
the rolls and violating civil service
in the coast and geodetic survey he
dropped it. Then he tried them on Mexico
with his charges of the mistakes of
the administration. He "got a rise out
of them" immediately on that score, and
followed it up with more hot shot. This
led him to risk trying a reference to
being "too proud to fight," and, whopee!
they rose to it with a hurrah.
Independent Thought Prevails.
Bear in mind that out in this western
country party lines are pretty well shot
to pieces. Independent thought prevails
to a most marked degree. In these circumstances,
and with the party platforms
so identical in many planks, the
personalities of candidates, their own
policies and plans, count. Mr. Hughes
is showing them what manner of mian
he is and telling them what he believes .
in. At Chicago he put in an important
day with the political leaders, who had !
come from all quarters. They had a ]
chance to "look him over" at their leisure,
to size him up from their own ,
viewpoint and get acquainted with him. ,
He showed a grasp of local political j
conditions and sympathy with the prob- \
lems that arise out of them. He de- ]
voted himself to making it clear in a |
sympathetic way that the bitter fac- j
tional troubles?and they are bitter to
the very core hare?must yield to the
national welfare of the party.
Mr. Hughes received assurances, ^>parently
sincere ones, that local Illinois .
factionalism will not be allowed to
militate against the party welfare. 1
Mr. Hughes' public reception at Chi- 1
cago was certainly most encouraging. ]
Eetween times of conferring with the
local leaders he held a reception at ]
republican headquarters, where a ,
couple of thousand men from the busi- s
ness district shook his hand.
Newspaper? Friendly. 3
The newspapers of Chicago were more
than friendly to him and they have
not been overly friendly to the national
republican party in the past four
More than 10,000-people turned out to
hear him speak at the Coliseum last
night, packing that immense auditorium
to the doors and hundreds ,
standing along the sides. There were
a great many women in the audience. c
Women will vote for presidential elee- J
tors In Illinois this fall and are tak- c
ing Intense Interest in national politics. t
Mr. Hughes' speech was well re- c
ceived and -his criticism of the admin- f
istratlon's Mexican policy was vigor- I
ously applauded. The audience was r
with him, too, in his appeals to Amerl- a
canlsm and at the close of his speech d
the entire audience stood and cheered 1

Beginning New Campaign.
ROME, August via Paris. August ?,
1:15 a~m.?The successes won by the
Italians on the ls?r.zo front, including
capture of the Gorr'.ia bridgehead, announced
today, are regarded in Rome
as marking merely the beginning of
the new campaign.

great satisfaction, it had long been
expected, and no .surprise is expressed,
nor have there been any unusual public
demonstrations. The attack was to
have been inaugurated earlier in the
summer, but was delayed by the Austrian
ofCen^ve.
"At last our waiting, planning and
steadfast faith arc bearing fruit,' says
the Giornale d'Italia.

the Italians began shelling of
the city of Gorizia to drive out the
Austrians. }.or man S.OOO prisoners
were taken August 6.
Vienna Admits Reverse.
VIENNA, August 8. via London,
August 9.?The loss of the Gorizia
bridgehead to the Italian forces is admitted
in the Austrian official statement
issued today. A withdrawal to
the eastern Isonzo, the statement says,
was necessary to avoid severe josses
to the defenders of the bridgehead^because
of the desperate attacks made by
the Italians.
Position Important One.
The Glorizia bridgehead was one of
the most important defensive positions
of the Austrians along ttie Isonzo
front. It was the scene of heavy fighting
in the early months of the war
when the Italians, after making considerable
advances, were finally held up
along the Isonzo line. Gorizia is twenty-two
miles northwest of Triest, one
of the principal objectives of the ItaJian
campaign, and regarded as the key
to that position.
One of the lirst acts of the Italians
after the war began was to throw a
strong force oi infantry and cavalry
icross the Austro-Hungarian frontier,
znd occupy a stretch of territory along
the Isonzo. They captured several
towns, but the Austrian positions, naturally
strong, had been heavily fortified,
and progress was slow. The fighting
along the Isonzo continued until
December. Since that time there has
L/ccii uiu; Davut uj1 14 luio
front until the last few days.
Opened a New Attack.
On Friday of last week the Italians
>pened a new attack, and, although the
authorities at Rome have permitted
DUt few detail to become known, it
has been Intimated that an important
campaign was being: lai-nched. The
lrst notable results were obtained Sunlay
when Italian t roops made considerible
progress in the Monfalcone sector.
Gorlzia is the principal city of the
!sonzo valley, with a population of
ibout 30,000.
