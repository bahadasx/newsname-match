ITALIANS CAPTURE GORITZ
SEIZE 25,000
PRISONERS AND
•BEGIN INVASION
ROME, Aug. 9.—The great Austrian
stronghold of Goritz, which for 14 months
h*s blocked an Italian invasion of Austria
from the west, has fallen before the Italian
armies.
The Italians are believed to have stormed
the citadel last night or early today, only a
few hours after they had battered their way
to victory at the Goritz bridgehead and cap
tured Monte San Michele, overlooking Go
ritz from the south. Ten thousand Austrian
prisoners were taken, according to the offi
cial announcement.
Goritz is the point of convergence of im
portant railways and the key to the whole
JPaln opening up to the invasion of Austria
from the west. In earlier attacks upon the
great Austrian stronghold the Italians had
sacrificed many thouunds of lives. The
Austrians, too. have suffered enormously in
repelling Italian attacks.
Two million men are battling fiercely
along the Isonzo front in a great struggle
centering about Goritz that may prove the
turning point of the war.
With the Goritz bridgehead and sur
rounding heights strongly in Italian hands,
Italians poured across the river for the
assault upon Goritz itself, singing gaily as
they advanced under hot iFire, their helmets
decked with flowers.
Scores of great guns pounded the Aus
trian stronghold.

MAYOR MEETS
BUSINESSMEN
ON STRIKE RIOT
Armed with figure* and report# from po
lice and detective departments, Mayor Gill
prepared to face 100 businessmen at the
Chamber of Commerce Wednesday after*
noon and place the blame for strike dis
orders on the water front employers.
The conference was called for 3 p. m.»
after charges of police neglect had been
signed by Judge Burke, and 99 others.
"I charge that the employers have failed
to co-operate, as they agreed to do, and that
the disorders have resulted from the failure
to keep strikebreakers confined to the docks
as was agreed," said the mayor.
Shortly before noon, detectives detailed
to investigate the story that H. P. Green, in
surance and club man, had been beaten and
shot by strike sympathizers at the port com
mission dock Saturday morning, reported.
"They learned that Green was taken to
the Imperial Turkish baths between 11 and
12 p. m. Sunday, instead of Saturday," said
the mayor, "and that his doctor prescribed
a tablespoonful of booze every two hours.
"Detective* Rartofl and Toms
have learned that the prescription
was filled at a drug store and ad
ministered by Attendant 1.. 11
Myers at the baths, Green's story
does not sound good to me. and I
deem It an Injustice."
Cresn Wore Plaster
The story of an alleged attack
upon Green was displayed aa an
evidence of lawlessness on the
water front, with the allegation
that the police were not protecting
life and property.
"The detectives have not been
able to find Green," said GUI "The
bath house attendant says he had
a plaster over his noee. and looked
like he had fallen down or been In
a fight."
The call for the conference of the
100 business men requested that
Mayor GUI appear.
To Protect Lives
It* object was to "take such
steps as may be necessary to pro
tect life and property and the good
tiame of the city."
Reference was made to the street
car riot Saturday night, when
strike sympathizers boarded a
street car near the longshoremen's
union hall and attacked negro
strike breakers
Statementa prepared by the
mayor were:
"Various conferences were held
between employers and myself
over the situation It was definite
ly agreed that the police should
patrol the water front, which we
have done.
"It was definitely agreed that
strikebreakers be sheltered and fed
on the docks, and that If any
strikebreakers came downtown,
guards w ere to te ephone us Hoth
agreements have been broken
"Th< re have been two months of
the strike There tiave been no
deaths, hut a strike guard nearly
killed two police officers down
town"
The mayor said he was ready,
first, to hear any suggestions, and
would be glad to follow out any
practical ones
"Then I'll teJI them the facts of
the situation, because 1 don't be
lieve one of the 100 gentlemen un
derstands the situation "
Donald's new family la all ready
for him, too.
Ills mother, Mrs. J. It. Gordon, Is
a dainty little woman, who has had
two daughters and has always
wanted a son. His sisters can
scarcely wait to welcome their new
brother: and his dad John I'rlaji
Gordon, already has offered his
son his second and third names,
anil an assistant managership In the
Polk's Directory Co. He says that
Donald might also have had his
first name hail he needed It
Donald's mother Is said to have
been a musician. Maybe, somer
where in Donald's plump person,
LOCAL MEN GAIN X.
ON WHEAT USE
Seattle grain speculators went
wild over «ie soaring price of
wheat.
One young baHerer who appeared
when the market opened at ? a. m.
at Ix>gan & Bryan's exchange. In
the Smith building, said at U
o'clock he had cleaned up $1,800.
Another, older and more sea?
soned. said he had bought an entlr*
crop from a farmer In Tacoma laat
week at 93 cents. He was still
holding when the price hit 11.44.
Most other* were following hU
example. Few sold.
September wheat closed at Chi
cago at )1.44 1 4. a gain of lOTi cents
since Monday night.
December wheat closed at
11.4)1%, a gain of 11** rents. May
wheat closed at f 1 53. a gain of

The advance followed a govern
ment crop report of a shortage la

"We have gone over the whole
situation thoroly, but do not know
exactly what courses we will pur
sue." he said.
"Hlackman and myself are work
