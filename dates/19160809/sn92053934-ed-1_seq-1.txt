New York, Aug. 9.
The threatened strike of
the 400,000 railway em
ployes of the United States
was averted today when
the railroad brotherhood
accepted a proffer of the
United States board of me
diation and conciliation to
mediate their differences
with the railroads.
Announcement of the acceptance
of the offer -was made by A. 15.

brotherhood, after it had been de
livered by G. W. W. Ilantrer, a
member of the board, followine an
appeal to that body to intervene,
made today by the national con
ference of railroad manacers.
Jlr. Garretson said he. had in
formed tlie board that the offer
was accepted on the condition that
"its good offices are promptly
exercised."
w York, Aug. 9. The national
conference of railroad managers
today airaiu rejected the demands
of the four railroad brotherhoods
for an eight hour day and time and
a half for overtime and proposed
submission of their differences
with the men to the fnited Stales
board of mediation and concilia
tion. Elisha Lee, chairman of the railroad
conference, in proposing that their dif
ferences be mediated by the federal
board, said the brotherhoods had prev
iously declined arbitration under the
Newlands act, providing for six arbi
trators but that the railroads saw no
other -way out of their differences than
through mediation.
Arbitration rnsat.isfactory.
Mr. Garretson, reiterating the con
tention of the brotherhoods that in
previous attempts to settle differences
with the railroads through the federal
boards, the brotherhoods had failed
to obtain satisfactory awards, said
that the unions believed they could
reach a settlement by dealing directly
with the roads.
Chairman I-e then announced that
he would nevertheless appeal to the
federal board of mediation and con
ciliation. Ibis board was at the time
in a cession at a nearby hotel.
Mr. Lee's announcement tame after
Mr. Garretson bad expressed his will
ingness to have the railroads make the
appeal. In that event, he said, the
unions could make a reply as to their
attitude.
This rply, Mr. Garretson indicated
after adjournment of the meeting,
would probably be favorable.
Appeal to Board.
Ja-ie-e W. L. Chambers, chairman of
tho United States board of mediation
and conciliation, announced after the
adjournment of the meeting that the
railroads had formally appealed to the
board to mediate their differences with
the unions.
The board immediately prepared a
communication to the brotherhoods of
fering its service, which it was an
nounced would be dispatched to the
brotherhoods' chiefs at once.
Meantime, it was stated, the board
would remain in session to await the
brotherhoods' reply.
Both sides, after adjournment, went
into eexcutive session.

educational welfare of the northwest.

in the founding of the St. Paul Union
Stock Yards company at South St.
Paul.
In 18S3 Mr. Stickney began the or

took over the charter of the old Minne

As its president he extended the line
from St. Paul to Morley Junction,
Iowa, linked Lyle, Iowa, with the Illi
nois Central railroad and Morley
Junction with the Iowa Central rail
road and brought both of those lines
into St. Paul.
Soon afterward he extended a line
from Hayfield. Minn., to Chicago and
built a branch from Oelwein, Iowa, to
Omaha, under the name of Chicago, St.
Paul and Kansas City line. Later he
built a line from Oelwein to Omaha.
These lines, consolidated, formed the
Chicago, Great Western system. Mr.
Stickney then remained president of
the company until a year after it had
gone into receivership, resigning as re
ceiver because of failing health.

Men Held by
Belligerents
New York, Aug. 9. More than five
million prisoners, double the number

ports as to the treatment of prisoners
of war received have been greatly ex

prisoners receive virtually the same
food and care that the armies of re
spective countries do. Everything
possible is done for their comfort and
health.
"We have 45 American secretaries
working among the various armies and
1 hope to increase this number short

well received."
