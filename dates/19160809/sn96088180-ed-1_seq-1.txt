ACCEPTED
Representatives of Employes
Announce That Offer of
U. S. Board Is Approved if
Immediate Action Is Taken
New York, Aug. I. Representa
tives of the railroad employe an
onnced thti afternoon that they
would accept the offer of the United
States board of mediation and concil
iation to submit their demands to me
diation, provided action I Immediate
ly taken.
Acceptance of mediation by the em
ployes came as a big surprise. It
las been officially atsted by big
brotherhood officers that they would
discuss with the railroad managers,
but that a third party was unneces
sary. ft Is believed the personal plea of
the members of the United States
board brought about acceptance by
the trainmen. That means at least
postponement of the strike that would
have railed out 400,000 men and tied
up 150,000 mile of railway on 125
railroads of the country.
It was believed by representative!
of both tides that mediation negotts-
. tloni will, start Immediately, a, de
manded by the brotherhoods.
Immediately following the reading
of the decision of the employers, aa
executive meeting of representative!
of the 400,000 train employes was
called to consider the employers'
standing. ,
Representative of the employer!
headed 4y Ellaha Lee, chairman of
the national conference of the rail
ways, started at once to find memb
ers of the federal board of media
tion and conciliation and to present
their tequest for help to them per

Prisoners Wlen tie Citadel Is Surrendered
London, Aug. 9. The great Aus
trian stronghold of Gorlts which, for
14 months has blocked an Italian
Invasion of Austria from the west
has fallen before the victorious Ital
ian armies.
The Information first, given the
United Press from a London source,
was confirmed a few minutes later
by the receipt of official despatches
from Rome.
The Italians are believed to have
stormed the citadel last night or
early today, only a' few hours after
they had battered their way to vict
ory at the Oorlts bridgehead and
captured Monte San MIchele, over
looking Gorits from the south. '
Ten thousand Austrian prisoners
were taken, according to reports
reaching London. ' News of the Ital
ian stroke, the greatest single vict
ory for the allies since the offensive
against the central empires began,
tu received here an hour after of
ficial word came from Petrograd of
another Russian victory.
Advancing swiftly toward the rail
road city of SUnlslau, the Slavs cap
tared the town of Tysmtenlca'-an ad

a series of minor villages and fort
ified river heights In the Immediate

ish and French war office today, In
cluding a alight British advance north
of Poxieres.
The French officially admitted the
recapture of the Thlaumont work by
Germans, northeast of Verdun. '
. News of the fall of .Gorlts came
as no surprise to London after word
of the capture of the bridgehead and
surrounding positions had been re
ceived. A United Press despatch
from Rome this forenoon said that
the fall of Gorlts Itself was a matter
of but a few hours, "if It is not
already In Italian hands."

LO
IS CAPTURED
1915, opens the way for an Italian
advance southward toward Trieste,
one of the principal goals of the
Italians.
Gorlts Is the point of convergence
of important railways and the key
to the whole plain opening up to the
Invasion of Austria from the west.
In earlier attacks on the great Aus
trian stronghold the Italians had sac
rificed many thousands of lives. The
Austrlans. too, have suffered enor
mously In repelling Italian attacks.
The elty of Gorlts has a population
of about 30,000 and Is the capital
of a province. It lies on the east
bank of the Isonso river, surrounded
on three sides by mountain ridges
and peaks which constitute it a na
tural fortress. - Perhaps the most
notable building of the city Is the an
cient castle, formerly occupied by the
counts of Gorltx, but In modern
times converted Into a barracks. The
city has a tamoua fourteenth century
cathedral and a fine museum.
Rome. Aug. 9. Two million of
meCtra battering fiercely along the
Inonio front In a great atruggle cen
tertng about Gorits that may prove
the turning point of the war.
With the Gorlts bridgehead and
surrounding heights strongly In Ital
ian hands, Italian troops are pour
Ing across the river for the assault
on Gorlts Itself, singing as they ad
vance under hot fire.
Scores of great guns already are
pounding the Austrian stronghold
It Is believed certain here that Oor
its will fall before a storming at
tack within a few hours If It is not
already In Italian hands.
The battle Is spreading along the
Isonso. In the first two days of
the great offensive, more than 15,-
000 Austrian prisoners were captur
ed. ' The Austrlans resisted with the
greatest atubbornnes and suffered
heavy losses.
Rome was swept with a tremend
ous wave off enthusiasm today as
fresh despatches from the front
brought fragmentary details of the

London, Aug. 9. A mighty triple
offensive, with several million mea

the Italians since the war began, haa

offer desperate resistance at Gorlts,
but the apparent ease with which the
Italians took the fortified GoriU
bridgehead convinces military mea
here that the Austrlans have heea

On the western front, the allies
have won another slice of the German
second line, advancing on a front
of nearly four miles north of the
Somme. . German counter-attacks
caused the French to yield ground'

Only on the Verdun front, where
the Germans again re-occupled the
Thlaumont work In heavy fighting
last night, are the Teutonic armies
still on the offensive. The position
has changed hands eight times since
the Verdun campaign began.
Even In the far away Caucasus,
allied troops are again marching vic
