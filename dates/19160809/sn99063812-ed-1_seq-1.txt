That the Bohemian farmers of tho
J'allri district are In earnest in their
desire for a railroad, and are willing
to do their part, was evidenced at a
big mass meeting held at Malln Mon
day, at which it is said every farm
er in the district was present.
A vote was taken and the farmers
pledged themselves to furnish the
right of way for a railroad and do the
grading between Malin and Adams
Point. It is stated that a committee,
representing the Bohemion settlers (
visited Mr. Strahorn last week to in
terest him In a railroad connection
with the southern part of the county.
It Is said that they promised to sub
mit the railroad builder a proposition
as to what they were willing to do,
and that the meeting yesterday was
the result
The Central Oregon highway from
The Dalles south to Klamath Falls la
100 per cent better than the Pacific
highway from Medford north to Port
land, according to W. M. Knight of
Portland, who has Just returned to
Portland after an auto tour of Oregon.
Mr. Knight, according to the Oregon
Journal, says that tourists from Port
land to Crater Lake should go by way
of the Columbia highway to The Dalles
then south to Crater Lake and horn
by way of Medford and the Padfio
highway. In this manner, he says, the
grades on the Pacific highway or
easier.
Tt,e Knight party caught lar
strings of fish at nearly every stop
couth of The Dalles, particularly at
Odcll Lake. Mr. Knight Is quoted la
the Journal as saying that "the roads
from Fort Klamath to Crater Lake are
n bout perfect"
Mr. Knight was especially high in
his praise of the free anto camp
grounds In several Southern Oregon
towns, and says that Portland should
have similar grounds for tourists.
