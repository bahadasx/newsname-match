ANDERSON FIRST
ADULT VICTIM OF
PLAGUE TO DIE
Springfield Young Man Suc
cumbs to Poliomyelitis at
Hillside.
CASE ONE OF RAREST
TYPE THAT IS KNOWN
Sophian Says City Hospital
Will Be Established
Here Soon. ,
The first death of an adult infan
tile paralysis patient in this state
since the beginning of the epidemic,
occurred here this morning when
Harold Anderson, aged 21, of Spring
field, died at Hillside home.
Anderson's case was one of the
rarest and most peculiar of poliomye?
litis cases, according to physicians. He
was afflicted with the Landrys or as
cending type of the disease, which
paralyzes all the limbs after spread
ing with great rapidity. Only the
most strenuous of measures have kept
Anderson alive since Sunday, when
he. was taken to the home, it is eaid.
Anderson came to this city from
Springfield,. and lived at 804 Colorado
avenue. He, was taken ill in the lat
ter part of last 'week, but Sunday
his case was diagnosed, as actual
poliomyelitis.
His is the eighth death for Bridge
port. There have been 36 cases here,
making the mortality rate something
over 22 per cent. fr. . Sophian said
today that this is comparatively low,
as in epidemics, the mortality runs as
high as 30 per cent; - In normal times
it is In the neighborhood of 10 or 12
per centx ,
Excitement reigned in the neigh
borhood of 175 Poplar street today
-when, under stress of emotion, Mrs.
George Primavero fainted and her
husband created great disturbances.
Their two years old child. Alice, was
removed to Hillside home yesterday
because she was found to have infan
tile paralysis,, and this morning the
parents became excited, fearing, for
her. The ambulance corps was called
and Dr. J. P. Deery ' treated Mrs.
Primavero. y '
-The case of the five weeks' old sons
of Walter Blude of 360 Grand street
was declared definite today.. Another
new case was added to the list, that of
Dorothy Guerro, of 338 William
street. 1 ' . !
Nellie Boywid of 1159 Howard ave
nue, was reported considerably im
proved this morning at' Hillside Home.
She is expected to recover.
' Quarantines were lifted today at the
homes of Rudolph Kore, of 227 Union
avenue, who died, and Annie Horvath,.
of 173 Pine street. The Horvath case,
suspected at first to be poliomyelitis,
proved to be typhoid fever and the
girl has been removed to the Bridge
port hospital. '
Dr. Sophian announced today that
it looks as if Bridgeport will have a
city hospital very soon: ' Business men
of the city have pledged themselves
to see that the hospital is established.
Private subscription is expected to
finance the institution. It was inti
mated that those who conferred on
the project decided it will take too
long for the municipality to "start
things going." ''
Although setting a date on after
which no milk but that, can pass the
test shall be sold in Bridgeport (has
been postponed several times, the
health board expects to reach a de
cision next Tuesday. It is explained
that the members wish to- give the
milk dealers every opportunity to un
derstand the situation.
Dr. Sophian said today that the im
pression seems to be prevalent that
there is a misunderstanding- over the
milk situation. ' He said there isn't.
"We don't care whether milk dealers
pasteurize or not. What we are try
ing to do is to get wholesome milk
and we plan that none but' wholesome
milk shalll be sold in Bridgeport. Pas
teurization seems to be the logical way
of making all milk wholesome.
"However, the milk dealers say their
milk is wholesome and that they don't
want to sell any but wholesome milk.
They have agreed to the sanitary regu
lations. They have agreed to attain a
maximum bacteria count of 50,000 per
c. c. We have established 10,000 as
the limit, but if the dealers are will
ing to observe the 60,000 limit, we'll

SECRETARY LANE HEADS
U. S. BORDER MEDIATORS;
BRAUDEIS ALSO CHOSEN
.Washington, Aug. 9 Formal an-J
nouncement was made today byi Act
ing Secretary Polk, of the acceptance
of General Carranza's proposal for a
joint International commission to seek
a solution of border disputes and to
discuss other matters which may help
clarify, relations between the United
States and Mexico. Only the time and
place for the conference remained to
be decided.
v Secretary Lane, of the interior de
partment will head the American com
mission, supported by Associate Jus
tice Louis D. Brandeis, of the supreme
court, and a third commissioner whose
name will be announced later. A tele
gram asking the third man to serve
was sent today by President Wilson
and his name will not be disclosed un
til his acceptance is repeived.
The Mexican commissioners were
named some days ago, Luis Cabrera,
minister of finance in the Carranza
government, heading the delegation.
This made necessary the appointment
of a member of President Wilson's
cabinet in the American membership.
Today's announcement followed a
brief conference between Mr. Polk and
Elizeo Arredondo, Carranza's am
bassador-designate. Final assurance
was given by Mr. Arredondo that Car

LIGHTNING HITS
HOUSE TWICE IN
THUNDERSTORM
Two Cows Killed By Bolt
and Other Damage Done
In Bridgeport.
The home of J. W. Dunn In Barnum
avenue, Stratford, was struck by
lightning and two ' Holstein cows
worth $350 were struck and killed dur
ing the storms yesterday..
The first bolt of lightning in the
Dunn home flashed through the lower
floors and disappeared through a rear
window, doing little damage. The sec
ond bolt apparently came from the
clouded sky and struck the chimney,
bringing all the bricks down on the
roof. The first bolt followed a draft
to the Dunn home during the storm of
the afternoon! Mrs. Dunn immedi
ately rani to the home of a neighbor.
The secondi bolt came with the storm
of the evening. ' There was no one
home at the time. The damage is es
timated at $25. .
The Holstein cows were part of the
herd at Burnsford, the old. Calhoun
property, which the Burns Co. has re
cently taken over. The herd is in
charge of J. H. Risley. The property
has been named Burnsford, after
George Burns and Theodore B. Ford,
largest stock holders in the Burns Co.
The bolt struck the cows as they were
seeking refuge under some small trees.
The horns and heads of both animals
were blackened. . Risley - found the
herd today apparently much ' excited
although in a far corner of the pasture
from "where the death dealing . bolt
had descended. ' .'.
Efforts to get Messrs. Burns, Ford
or' Risley to make a statement today
were unavailing. It has been cur
rently reported that the Burns Co. -is
organizing a fine herd of milch cows
and. contemplates entering milk deliv
ery business, catering only to high
class family trade when the present
crusade against infantile disease here
has been adjusted.
Plunge In Sound '
Costs Baker $78
A plunge in the waters of Long
Island :; Sound that cost Albert
Schreiber of 1115 .Gilbert street $78
to take " a swim at the .public bath
houses at Seaside park yesterday. He
was' not arrested for any violation of
the law and fined that amount but
someone took the roll from his trous
ers while he . was disporting himself in
the surf.
Schreiber is one of the cake bakers
at the Bridgeport Public market and
yesterday believed that a "dip in the
after working in front Of the hot ovens
briny" would about counteract the
feeling which the heat caused. Pack
ing his bathing sy.lt, he treaded his
yym-y lu me uaui nouses UUL lu itia out -
row found that they were all crowded
and a line had formed of those waiting
to get keys.
But, as luck would have It, Schreiber
is a friend of Philip Mitchel, keeper of
the bath house, and the latter, oblig
ingly, allowed Schreiber to use the
private room . where Mr. Mltchel'a
friends and the life guards dress. The
door of the room was locked after
Schreiber had donned his bathing slut
and was ready for the water. He
asked Mr. . Mitchel's-daughter to hold
the money for him but she said that
they never did that and Schreiber left
the greenbacks in his trousers while
he cavorted in the salt sea waves.
After enjoying a swim of about a
half hour's duration, he went In and
got dressed and placing his hand in
his pocket was almost distracted to
find that the money was missing. He
complained to the keeper but was told
that the money should hve been left
with him for safe v""plng. Mr. Mlt
chel was told that his daughter would
not hold the money but he said the
money should have been left with him.
' Echrelber complained to the police last
(night bat the money U still miss Inc.
suggestions of the Washington govern
ment that the discussion of the com
missioners be given the broadest pos
sible scope. The ambassador said that
his government regarded its recent
note as a full answer and acceptance
of Secretary Polk's suggestions that
the scope be broadened.
As it begins its task the commission
will be required first to reach some
conclusion on the specific points out
lined by General Carranza in his
original proposal. The first subject
treated under this view would be the
withdrawal of American troops from
Mexico to be followed by negotiation
of a protocol covering future military
operations along the border.
Since these two points are closely
Interwoven it is believed the commis
sion will couple them together - in
whatever recommendations it has to
make.
State department officials said it was
not necessary for all matters to be
worked out before ' recommendations
could be submitted for ratification.
On the other hand, it was regarded as
possible t lat eah agreement reached
by the co.rimission would be reported
and acted upon by the two govern
ments separately. The conclusions of
the commission will be in no way bind
ing upon either government until both
have ratified any suggested plan.
HILL DEFENDS -HIS
ACTIONS IN
COUNTY OFFICE
Says He Never Failed to Act
In Case Where the Law
' and Facts Justified:
Replying to criticistdirected at the
present system .of health supervision
in Connecticut, . which has been said
by physicians and others to be inef
fectual and' antiquated, ', George E,
Hill, health officer for Fairfield
county said today: -
"The statement that Dr. Valery
Havard of Fairfield, or Dr. Wv H.
Donaldson his predecessor, resigned
because they believed that lack of co
operation hampered their work is
news to me. .
"It has never been stated to me
by either of these gentlemen that they
resigned for the reason that they fail
ed to get proper support from the
county health officer. '
. "Neither have I any recollection of
any instances where . action was re
quested to be taken by the town
health officer of Fairfield which was
not acted upon, provided the facts and
the law justified it." ' "
While the county health officer re
fused to discuss the general situation
of state, county and town health mat
ters for publication today in opposi
tion to statements recently made ag
itating full power for the state board
of health, and abolition of the . legal
system in connection with health mat-
tr. . it is generally known this mat
ter has lpng been under discussion.
During the session of the last Gen
eral Assembly the question arose and
was placed in" the hands of a commis
sion comprised of Dr. William H. Car
malt of New Haven; Howard Cheney,
South - Manchester, and Edward K.
Root, president of the state board of
health. As a result a bill was drafted
aimed to give the state board of health
more power, right to name district in
spectors, and to give the town officers
more control.

the handlebars Of the machine and
Johnson was unable to clear himself
from the wire and was killed by the

part way out of the car and his face
was in the water in the gutter, but one
leg was in contact with the metal of
the car and completed the circuit for
the current.

nearby, telephoned to the power sta
tion to' have the current .turned off,
but it was about 15 minutes before this
was done. The pulmotor was sent for

WILL SETTLE
DIFFERENCES
Employes Accept Proffer of
Mediation From Federal ;
Officials After Managers
Again Wholly Eeject
Their Demands. .
Brotherhoods, While Willing
to Submit Grievances to'
Board, Kef use to Join1
With Managers in Appeal
to That ody.
t
New York, Aug. 9 The s
threatened strike of, the 400,000
railway employes of the Uni
ted States was averted today!
when the railroad brother-
hoods accepted a proffer of the ;
United States board of media-!
tion and conciliation to medi-j
ate their differences with the
railroads.
The managers previously
had rejected again the demands
of the. men and. had proposed
a submission of the differences
to the federal board of media- j
lion. This proposal. A. B. Gar-
retson, in behalf of the broth-1
erhoods, rejected.
Mr, Garretson was willing,'
however, that the railroads
make the appeal to the board
and indicated that the brother
hoods' reply to,, the proffer
from " the-' board 'wimld be fa- - J
vorable. 1 - '
Chairman Lee, In rejecting the
brotherhoods' demands and proposing ;
mediation, made a statement in part !
as follows: .
"Th national conference committee
of the railways has'1 again given most :
careful consideration to the matters in i
controversy between us and to all that
ha been said in our various confer-
enow We have also carefully consld- ;'
ere the serious situation presented by
the result of the strike vote of em, .
plove and the grave "responsibility ;
which rests on both parties to the con- V
ference to exhaust every honorable
means to avoid the public ' injury
which must Inevitable result should
you decide to exercise the power.
"The national conference committ-
tee of the railways Is as sincerely anx- .
ious as your committee can be to reach
some amicable adjustment of the mat
ters involved in the controversy but
we are; convinced that in the end we .
shall have to invoke the friendly of
fices of the board of mediation."
Judge W. L. Chambers, chairman .
of the United States Board of Media-
tion and Conciliation, announced after ;
the meeting that the railroads had
formally appealed to . the board to '
mediate their differences with the '
unions. ;
The board Immediately prepared a .
communication to the Brotherhoods
offering its services, which it was an-i
nouncel would be dispatched to the'
Brotherhood chiefs at once. .
Ellsha 'Lee, chairman of the rail
road conference, ' lit proposing that '
their differences be mediated by the
federal board, called attention to the ;
fact that the Brotherhoods had pre--viously
declined arbitration under the
Newlands act, but that the, railroads,
saw no other way out of their dlffl
culties than through mediation.
Mr. Garretsort reiterated the con
tention of the Brotherhoods that in .
previous attempts to settle differences
with the railroads through "the feder
al board the Brotherhoods had failed
to obtain satisfactory awards and aali
that -the unions believed they could
reach a settlement by dealing directly,
with the directors. . .
"I believe." he said, "settlement ol
our differences can be much better
attained by dealing directly with you
without the interference of a third
party."
Meantime. It was stated the hoard .
would remain In session to await the'
Brotherhoods' reply.
It was indicated by members of the
board thsft the communication was
being sent on the assumption that the :
Brotherhoods would accept their of-'
fer. A peply was expected this af
ternoon, it was said. , "
Both sides, after adjournment went
into , executive session. '
Mr. Garretson explained to . news
papermen that the union' had not de
clined mediation" unequivocally but
had refused to Join with the railroads'
in asking for It because they did not
believe in It at this time. The
Brotherhoods' chief .together with his
colleague, W. . R. Stone, related that
their position was that they had not
yet exhausted all the possibilities by
dealing directly with., the manag
ers. -..'-.' ' . -1
"However," said .Mr. Garretson,
"our position is something like Bar
kis' we are waiting and willing.
