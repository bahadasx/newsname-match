COOKS ATTACK MRS- JOHNSTON
COMPLMN
OF FILTHY
KITCHENS
Charging that the kitch
ens of many Tacoma res
taurants are filthy, and that
Pure I mill Inspector (.race
I*. Johnston is making no ef
fort to Improve sanitary con
ditions there, a committee
from the cooks and waiters'
union appeared before the
elty council today and ask
ed for relief.
Mrs. Johnston devotes-: her in
spection to the dining rooms and
front part of the restaurant, de
manding that they he spick and
span, the committee declared,
but has done nothing to improve
the quality of food served from
the kitchen, or to enable the
cooks and waiters to have better
working conditions.
Those who represented the
restaurant workers were Thomas
A.. Blshoff,. secretary .of .the
union; George P, Humphrey, a
waiter, and Charles Keith, a
cook.
I'uling Brings Kirk.
The cooks and waiters, gave as
their reason for appearing before
the council, a recent ruling of the
health board demanding certifi
cates of health from all persons
handling food.
They insited that the health
officer should provide the certifi
cate, instead of permitting any
physician to sign It, representing
that unscrupulous persons might
obtain certificates without being
entitled to them.
"But our greatest complaint is
the fact that the cooks and wait
ers must furnish a clean bill of
health, yet are forced to work in
filthy, unhealthy kitchens," said
Secretary Blshoff.
"We are glad to provide the
certificate, in the interest of pub
lic, health. But if we are forced
to work in these unclean kitch
ens it will not be many years be
fore we become ill with tuber
culosis and are thrown out, to be
dependents upon the public.
Describe Filthy Kitchens.
"The present pure food Inspec
tor is a farce. Instead of work
ing with thercooks and waiters in
an effort to clean up the kitchens,
she antagonizes us. I can show
you kitchens where grease and
filth is piled under the floor to a
depth of over 12 inches.
"In some restaurants the
bones from steaks and chops are
used to make brown gravy, when
they should be thrown out. Many
of the kitchens are so dirty that
they would turn the stomachs of
the person who is eating In the
dining-room outside, yet we have
to work under such' conditions.
"If Mrs. Johnston would attend
some of our meetings. Instead of
devoting her time to the North
End Improvement club and the
women's clubs, she would learn
something about the work that
she Is trying to do."
Call Special Meeting.
flishoff charged that Mrs.
Johnson had on one occasion rec
ommended that he buy crackers
from a certain manufacturer, "be
cause they were more fresh."
"If Mrs. Johnston Is not doing
ber duty, or if she Is antagoniz
ing you, I certainly want to Know
It," said Mayor Fawcett.
A special meeting of the coun
cil will be hold Thursday morn
ing, to probe today's charges.

A Shark-Infested Locality
Woman Accuses So. Tacoma
Man of Fearful Brutality
Applying lo Deputy Prose
cutor Sclilen for a tvurrant
for the arrest of Andrew
Nelsou, South Tacoma hard
ware man, on charges of as
sault, Mrs. Helen Wharton,
.-.nil.-, South Ilirniinghaiu st.,
told a story of brutality Wed
nesday that compares with
the i-.'irk tortures of medieval
ages.
Mrs. Wharton declared that her
both hands were clamped between
the rollers of a wringer, used for
wringing clothes, and while she
was pinioned in this manner she
was beaten about the head and
shoulders, and kicked.
The alleged assault occurred
last Friday. Mrs. Wharton de
clared that she had been confined
to her bed ever since.
Nelson was arrested Wednas
day on Mrs. Wharton's warrant,
and released under $50 ball. The
case will be tried next Wednesday
in police court. Nelson denied
the charge.
According to the story told by
Mrs. Wharton to Prosecutor Sel
den at police court today, she re
cently purchased a wringer, wash
boiler, wash board and electric
iron from a man who came to
her door with them.
I .list Friday the hardware deal
er, Nelson, came to her house and
declared that the articles were
his. He arrived at the house just
as Mrs. Wharton waa doing her
week's washing.
Nelson charged that he had
sold the washing outfit to a man
in South Tacoma, whom he had
later learned had resold them to
Mrs. Wharton and had left the
city.
The man paid only one install
ment of the purchase price to Nel
son.
' Mrs. Wharton told Selden that
she refused to permit Nelson to

him, maintaining that she had
bought it legally.
The hardware man tried to take
them forcibly, and during the
scuffle, he deliberately forced her
hands into the wringer, turned
the handle until she was held a
fast prisoner, and then adminis
tered a beating, so she alleges.
He went away, and she was ex
tracted by neighbors, who were
attracted by her crief for help.

Everybody wants low taxes. Sonic persons will
■ "In lief their heads off to get theiu.
'Must everybody wants to sec Tacoma and tlie
country surrounding Tacoma improved and made
; attractive and safe to live in and do lin-iness in.
Many—atttomobilists for example—will raise a big
noise to get speedy improvements, forgetting mo
mentarily the pain.
Every City or county officer wants every voter to
vote for him, and so lie wants tv please every voter
wini wants improvements and also every other who
wants low taxes.
, How to harmonize these wants and leave every
body in good humor is the problem over which city
md county members of tlie board of equalization are
knocking their heads together.
A hoard of equalization is a peace conference
where taxpayers enter their kicks because the prop
erty assessments aren't dealt out according to their
idea of the proper size and ratio.
lint the particular peace conference which is now
meeting in the county assessor's office shows signs
of developing some of flic symptoms of the lord
pence ship.
It seems that County Assessor Cameron, after ex
amining recent transfer of property in Tacoma and
the county, has discovered that it has been kept at
boom values, for the purposes of taxation.
I ie has found, he says, tbat the assessed valuation
of Tacoma property has been held up nearly $9,000,
--000 higher in the aggregate than its actual value. So
he has chopped that nine millions off.
Because the taxes which you and II have to pay
lit based tm the assessed valuation of our property,
Cameron claims he is cutting our taxes. Is he?
) That's the question which is being raised by tbe
cite members of the board, who, of course, want to
please the voters of Tacoma.
'* Various theories of taxation seem to be in cvi
, deuce. One is that the valuation of property on
which the amount of taxes is based doesn't make
much difference, so long as it is distributed propor
tionately among property owners. Also, that when
prices drop, assessed valuations must be kept up in
order to keep tbe tax rate down and at the same

lime meet the necessary expenses of govrnment. This
is (he view which stands in awe of an increase in tax
levy.
A second view is that when values decline and
business is thill, it is righl and proper to reduce the
assessed valuation, hut youTl have to raise the tax
levy to meet the demand for improvement-. This
is a view held by few office seekers.
A third view is that when prices are low. the as
.sesseil valuation must he cut accordingly, hut nobody
has any business raising the tax rate. It is the view
that says: "When business is poor and prices are
down it is up to city and county to chop ex|>enses, no
matter how much people holler for improvements."
This is Cameron S view. Ilc says it's the only real
business method.
THE ONIA' TROUBLE IS IT MEANS THE
CITY FATHERS WILL HAVE JUST $105,000
LESS TO SPEND.
There's no way out of that. The city can't raise
its tax rate, because that levy is already up lo its
limit of 15 mills.
Commissioner Atkins has been the chief mourner
so far.
11 has been argued by at least one member of tbe
city commission that Cameron's cut in assessed valu
ations won't cut taxes.
On llw fare of it this argument won't hold wafer
IN Hill CITY. The city tux rate can't be raised.
It's as high as it can go. 'faxes will have to drop
with the assessed valuations.
Hut what of the county, where the levy has not
reached its limit ? The county levy can be raised.
It is estimated that if the county levy remains as
it is now and Cameron's cut in valuations is allowed
to stand. $8,000 will have to be cut out of the road
and bridge fund, that flexible, uncertain, vote-get
ting, spending money, the first name of which is
patronage.
The total cut in available county funds, it is esti
mated, will he between $80,000 aiid $85,000, unless
the levy is increased.
Rather than lose this spending money, will the
county attempt to shove on a higher tax rate? Or
will the commissioners take their medicine and keep
the taxes down?
THAT'S THE THING THAT WILL BE
WORTH WATCHING.
Cameron claims his reduction in assessed valuar
Hon, if allowed to stand, will mean not only a cut in
city and county taxes, but a reduction of more than
$50,000 in Pierce county's share of state taxes, if the
state levy of 6.467 mills remains the same.
