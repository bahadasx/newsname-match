Heavy showers during the night
caused much damage in thi3 part of

Mrs. Ann F. Baldwin. v
It is with deep regret that we report
the death of Mrs. Ann Foss Baldwin,
which occurred at her home in Lyndon
ville, Monday morning, August 7,
afterja long illness. The deceased was
born in Barton, June 21, 1841, the
daughter of Selden and Roxan Wheeler
Foss. She was united in marriage to
Joseph Porter Baldwin, over fifty-one
years ago, and all of her married life
was spent in Barton. She was a woman
of exceptionally strong character
and one who was always interested in
the best things in the community.
She was for many years a member
ef the W. C. T. U., and. one of its most
earnest workers ; at one time a most
efficient member of the board of trus
tees of Barton Academy, a great read
er and of more than ordinary intellect
ual ability, her wise counsel was often
sought. A kind neighbor and loyal
friend, she will be missed by a large
circle of friends, not only in Barton,
where she had lived for so many years,
but wherever she has been, for she
was respected and loved by all who
knew her. Mrs. Baldwin is survived
by one sister, Mr3. Juliet Overmyer, of
Senaca, Kansas, a brother, Mozart
Foss, of Arlington, Mass., and three
sons, George C., of Philadelphia,
Charles C, of Keene, N. H., and
Henry P., of this town. Funeral ser
vices were held from her late home in
Lyndonville this morning at 10 o'clock
and the remains were brought here on
the noon train, and interment was in
the family lot in Welcome O. Brown
cemetery. A prayer service was held
at the grave which was attended by
many Barton friends.

A REAL COUNTY FAIR
The Orleans County fair to be held at
Barton, August 22, 23 and 24, promises
to be more nearly a real county fair
than any event of its kind in recent
years. Local exhibitors of cattle and
all kinds of premium winning live
stock express their expectation of
coming to the fair to a greater extent
than usual and this is the feature that
particularly pleases many fair goers.
The thrilling balloon act already an-
nouncea is exciting consiaeraoie com
ment and the stage attractidns that have
been booked are far and away better
than anything appearing on the grand
stand stage of late. Another thing
that is of particular interest is the
baby contest. This is a contest for
points of perfection in physical devel
opment in babies under one year of age
and will be judged by competent but
disinterested parties. Liberal cash
offers are made for the three winners.
From every standpoint it is noted that
this year's event promises to be more
nearly a real old-tashioned fair than
many of the recent fairs. The price
remains 35 cents for single admissions.

We come
to 6tate in a p'ain
and dire:
manner our faith, cur
purpose and
our pledge.
This
representative
:t..cnn3 is a
happy augury. It means the
strength of reunion. It means
that the party of Lincoln is re
stored, alert, effective. It means
the unity of a common percep
tion of paramount national
needs. It means that we are
neither deceived nor benumbed
by abnormal conditions. We
know that we are in a critical
period, perhaps more critical
than any period since the civil
war. We need a dominant
sense of national Unity, the ex
ercise of our best constructive
powers, the vigor and resource
fulness of a quickened America.
We desire that the Republican
party as a great liberty party
shall be the agency of national
achievement, the organ of the
effective expression of dominant
Americanism. What do I mean
by that? I mean America con-
scious of power, awake to obli
gation, erect In self respect, pre
pared for every emergency, de
voted to the ideals cf peace, in
stinct with the spirit cf human
brotherhood, safeguarding both
individual opportunity and the
public interest, maintaining a
well ordered constitutional sys
tem adapted to local self gov
'ernrnent without the sacrifice of
essential national authority, ap
preciating the necessity of sta
bility, expert knowledge and
thorough organization as the in
dispensable conditions cf secu
rity and progress; a country
loved by its citizens with a pa
triotic fervor permitting no divi
sion in their allegiance and no
rivals in their affection I mean
America first and America effi
cient. It is in this spirit that
I respond to your summons.
From Mr. Hughes speech of acceptance.
