AIRSHIP WILL FLY
AT THECOUNTY FAIR
st Section of Big Cattle Barn
To Be Built—Other Improve
ments Planned.
One of the big features of the 191»
Kandiyohi County Fair will be a real
iird man, who will make two flights
a day with a hydro-plane, from Foot
lake near the beach inside of the fair
grounds. "Dare Devil Mills" is
known thruout the country for his
daring stunts in the air, which will
include altitude flying, spirals, figure
ej^hts, etc. Tho airship will be her?
/and fly on the three last days of the
fair.
Members of the Board of Managers
held a meeting at the grounds last
Thursday. Among other things it was
decided to build a barn to accommo
date the cattle exhibit, or at least a
section of it. The importance of the
live stock industry to the county is
never lost sight of by the Board, and
it is to be hoped that stockmen thru
out the county will co-operate to make
the best showing this fall.
It is expected also to inaugurate a
movement to grade a section of the
ground inside the track before the
fair, to permit the parking of autos
there during the fair. This grading
will be done with the view of provid
ing ample room for a base ball dia
mond, which will make it possible to
use the grounds for athletic games.
A liberal provision for a horse rac
ing program was made. The board
decided that there should be no cycle
races this year.
Negotiations are on for a carrous
sell with jumping horses and an en
tirely new line of pay attractions.
The premium, list will be mailed in
a- few days all over the county. If
you fail to get one, a card sent to W.
O. Johnson, Secretary, at Willmar will
bring one to you.

About Business 8chools.
It is quite a problem for many grad
uates of grade schools) and high
schools to know whether to take any
further training, and even if they do
wish to learn something useful it is
to decide what course to take.
I little difference what one
may decide to do in life, there are few
courses more practical and helpful to
every walk of life than thorough in
struction in shorthand, typewriting
and bookkkeeping.
There are more positions clamoring
for competent help in these branches
than can possibly be supplied, and any
student who studies faithfully and ap
plies himself to his lessons can fit
himself for his first position within a
year after beginning the course. Al
though possibly more expensive to go
to the best schools, in the long run the
better positions they secure for their
pupils, and the better training they
give their students repays one many
times over. Be sure, in making your
choice of a business school, to select
the best one you can find. Watch our
columns for the advertisement of such
a school.

Mattson, well known in Minnesota his

BAND CONCERT THIS
WEEK ATJIOMEWOOD
Ladies Will Serve Refreshments
For Benefit Of Park
Improvements.
Owing to circumstances beyond the
control of the band members, the
open-air concert advertised to take
place at Homewood Park last Friday
evening did not materialize. There
was quite a number of people who
came out and were disappointed, not
least the ladies who were to serve re
freshments for the benefit of the park.
It is to be regretted that this dissa
pointment should occur.
Unless bad weather should prevent
the concert will take place next Thurs
day (tomorrow) evening, and the la
dies will serve refreshments. The
water mains have been extended un
der the railroad yards into Homewood
addition, and it is now proposed to
put a drinking fountain and faucet in
for use of picniccrs at the park. As
the park fund is low, the ladles of
the Housekeepers' Club agreed to
serve refreshments on the occasion of
the next band concert at the park, the
proceeds to be used for extending the
water into the park. Don't forget to
go to Homewood Park tomorrow eve
ning, enjoy the music and patronize
the committee of ladies who serve re
freshments.
