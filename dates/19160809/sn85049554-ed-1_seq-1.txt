Wilson Administration as Wasteful
and Vacillating—Promisee to End
"Pork Barrel Legislation"—Speaks
Before Audience of 12,000 at Coli
seum—Evokes Repeated Applause.
St. Paul, Aug. 9.—The strain of un
accustomed campaigning had told
somewhat upon Charles E. Hughes
when he reached here today. He was
fatigued and hlo voice was hoarse. The
throat specialist accompanying him
urged him to save his voice for his two
meetings here and at Minneapolis.
At Winona Mr. Hughes expressed
gratifcation in the interest of the crowd
which had brought them so early to
the station.
Mr. Hughes declined'to comment on
the telegram sent him yesterday by
Acting Secretary Sweet denying
charges made in the Detroit speech In
reference to the retirement of E. Dan*
Durand, of the census bureau, and an
"eminent scientist of the coast and
geodetic survey," who Mr. Hughes as
serted had been displaced by an "ex
cellent stock breeder and veterinary
surgeon."
WASTE AND VACCILATION.
Hughes Charges Wilson Administra
tion With Many Shortcomings.
Chicago, Aug. 9.—Charles E. Hughes
last night told an audience that crowd
ed Chicago's great Coliseum, the hall
where he was nominated for the presi
dency, what he would do If elected
president of the United States.
Mr. Hughes charged the present ad
ministration with waste, extravagance
and vaccilation. He declared that it
had kept the country out of war but
that it had fought an ignominious
war in Mexico and had withdrawn
from that war ignominiously. He
charged the administration with hav
ing brought the country much nearer
to participation in t&p European war
than the country wotnd have been had
the administration "stood for Ajpert
"Sah"'rights.*' "v'•
Expeet No Protection.
He declared that it was no more
possible to expect tariff protection to
American industries from a democratic
congress than it would be to expect
a "revival sermon out of a disorderly
house."
The nominee assailed the adminis
tration also for its appointments to
office and declared that if elected he
would appoint to office only men who
were well qualified.
Democratic expenditures for rivers
and harbors were attacked by the nom
inee.
"I propose that we shall stop this
pork business," he said. "I propose
that we shall have government in a
business-like way. We won't have any
more if I can stop it, of these 'kiss
me and I'll kiss you' appropriations in
congress." The nominee said he stood
for a "business-like responsible bud
get" based on facts.
Wants No Hot Air.
"I do not want any hot air in mine,"
he added.
The democratic party, Mr. Hughes
said, was approaching the idea Of a
protective tariff, "like a skittish horse
to a brass band." In 1912, he added,
the democratic platform had said in
effect that a protective tariff was un
constitutional.
"They say in effect now that the
European war has changed tl\e con
stitution of the United States," he con
tinued. "But do you think they are
converted? Don't you trust them a lit
tle mipute with protecting American
industry. They haven't got it in their
bones."
Mr. Hughes reiterated much of his
Detroit speech regarding the adminis
tration's Mexican policy.
Policy Destructive.
"It has no right," he said, "'to com
mit this country to a course of con
duct which landed Mexico in anarchy,
left our citizens a party to the rav
ages of revolution and made our name
a word of contempt in a sister re
public."
"We have gone forward," the nomi
nee said in speaking of the adminis
tration's Mexican policy, "with a de
termination to" be destructive not con
structive, to destroy all they had."
As to the administration's foreign
policy, Mr. Hughes said:'
"We have allowed our words to be
eaten up by hesitation, by delay. We
have somehow or other convinced the
world that our talk is cheap.
Does Not Fear War.
"I propose that we have a new birth
of American purpose and courage. We
have no occasion to fear war in the
assertion of those rights, which all,
recognize and only respect us for
maintaining. But if we are glib in
speech, if we indicate that we are not
ready to meet the full responsibility
that our words imply, we are pushed
a little further and a little further
until-some fine day events occur which
arouse an implacable resentment from
one end of the country to the other.
This is the danger of war.
"This administration hafe come near
er to landing us in war by its weak
ness than it would ever have come had
It stood faithfully for American rights
and had let it be known that they
would be defended.
Efficient Administration.
"I believe that with our peaceful
purpose, our just purpose, we have no
occasion to be drawn Into strife,. if
we are prepared, if we are dignified,
if we show that we mean what we say.
And desire thai aa we kMc the
." fjA^/-^
Mr. Hughes spoke for nearly an
hour. He entered a hall that was so
jammed that even the steel cross gird
ers were utillssed for seats. The au
dience cheered him for five minutes
before he spoke. A brass band perched
in a loft at the far end of tho hall,
played three stanzas of the "Star
Spangled Banner" during the demon
stration, but the music was lost in the
volume of other sound.
The nominee left at 10:45 last night
for St. Paul.
Willcox Returns East.
Chicago, Aug. 9. W. R. Willcox,
chairman of the republican national
committee, left today for New York,
leaving the western campaign in
charge of Alv'n T. Hert, of Loulsvillu.
No statement was made by Mr. Will
cox on the factional fight reported
from San Francisco, but he said before
leaving he might give out something
on it as he passed thru Cleveland.

tion be taken up first. It is regarded
as possible that the meeting will be
held at some resort on the Jersey
coast.
Commission Given Free Hand.
As It begins its task the commission
will be required to reach some con
clusion on specific points outlined by
General Carranza. The first subject
would be the withdrawal of American
troopji from Mexico, to be followed by
the issuance of a protocol covering ac
tivities on the border.
The immediate military situation on
the border disposed of, the commission
will be ready to proceed with its re
maining specific task, investigation to
determine whether interests desiring in
tervention have inspired border raid%
It is believed the commission will bo
left to map out Its own course in trac
ing these raids. Without doubt it will
have power to travel to the border or
into Mexico to follow up its Inquiry.

Road Managers and Brotherhood Of

Controversy Over Eight-Hour Day-
Federal Board Tenders Service* and
Offer I* Accepted by Managers—Of
fer Agreed to by Brotherhood*.
New York, Aug. 9.—The threat
ened strike of the 400,000 railway
employes of the United State* was
averted today when the railroad
brotherhood* acoepted a proffer of
the United States board of medi
ation and conciliation to mediate
their differences with the railroads.
New York, Aug. 9. Whether the
threatened strike of 400,000 railway
employes in the United States will be
averted "thru mediation by the federal
board of mediation and conciliation de
pended at noon today on whether the
brotherhoods were willing to accept the
good offices of that body.
The railroad officials today rejected
the demands of the men and suggested
that the difficulties be submitted to the
board. The federal board, which is in
session here, then offered its services
to the brotherhoods. The Indication*
were that this time the reply would be
favorable.
The national conference of railroad
managers, after again rejecting the de
mands of the four brotherhoods, pro
posed submission of their differences
with the men to the United States
board of mediation and conciliation.
Jockeying For Position.
This proposal A. B. GarreUon, of the
order of railroad conductors, rejected
on behalf of the brotherhoods.
Chairman Lee then announced that
lie would nevertheless appeal to the
federal board of mediation and con
ciliation.
Mr. Lee's announcement came after
Mr. Garretson had expressed hi* will
ingness to have the railroads make the
appeal. In that event, he ^«ld, the
unions-could make a fepiy as to their
attitude to the federal board. This re
ply, it was indicated, would probably
be favorable.
Judge W. L. Chamber?, chairman of
the United States board of mediation
and conciliation, annuunced that the
railroads had formally appealed to tho
board to mediate their differences with
the union.
The board immediately prepared a
communication to the brotherhoods of
fering their services.
Time Not Ripe, Says Garretson.
Meantime, it-, was stated, the board
would remain in session to await tho
brotherhoods' reply.
It was indicated by members of th*
board that the communication was be
ing sent on the assumption that the
brotherhoods would accept their offer.
Both sides after adjournment went
into executive session.
Mr. Garretson explained to news
paper men that the unions had not de
clined mediation unequivocally, but ha.i
refused to join with the railroad
asking for it, because they did not be
lieve In it at this' time.
The brotherhood chiefs reiterated
that their position was that they had
not exhausted all possibilities In deal
ing with the road managers.
Wilson Kept Advised.
Washington, Aug. 9. President
Wilson was advised today by Secretary
Wilson of developments in the threat
ened railroad strike. Secretary Wilson
will remain for the present in New
York. So far he has not advised the
president to take any formal steps in
the situation. He is keeping in close
touch with the members of the federal
board of mediation and conciliation.
