NEW YOHK, X. Y., Aug. 9.
Hope for a peaceful set 1 lenient of
the railroad- controversy, menac
ing every trans-eoritineutal line
wi7h a tie-up. came today when
the chief of the four great broth
erhoods of railway employes
agreed to accept the good oflhes
of the federal government in an
attempt to adjmt the differences.
For week federal mediators
have been attempting to get the
; controversy More a federal board
for; arbitration and. until today
the brotherhoods refused to yield.
But with the situation at a sharp
crisis, and with the employers
-still declining to yield to the de
mands for an eight-hour day and
time and a half for overtime, the
union leaders, instead of deelar-
Ing for a if immediate strike, have
' t urned t a t he federal government
t.o provide, a. board iefore which
the discussion will Ik? taken up.
The acceptance of the principle
of federal mediation byt he raU
; way brotherhoods is virtually cer
tain to avert a strike for the pres-
cut, provided the railroads live up
to; their announcements. They
iavf,f.one' on .record in advertise-,
ments and circulars as declaring
that they desire public inquiry and
arbitration. They made formal
projosal to the employes of set
tlement of the controversy prei
ferably by submission to the Inter
state Commerce! Commission. ' At
the joint conference in New York
last June the brotherhoods de
ed ined t o accept mediat iou by ah
outside public lonrd. '

The garrison at Schofield Barracks
now consists of the 1st 25th and 32nd
regiments of Infantry, . the 1st and

the 4th Cavalry. The strength of the
enlisted personnel has not yet been
increased- but in a few months the
increment will be quite noticeable.
This gives a very strong reinforced

The possibilities inherent In such

and ideas. There is no ' doubt
that Oahu will benefit in each yearly
