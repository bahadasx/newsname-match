KIXKD LOW PLACES
St. Paul, Minn., November 10 Thirty-eight
precincts whose records show
they should poll about 400 votes, the
2,100 ballots cast by the stale soldiers
In Texas, and the votes of railroad and
traveling men under the absent voters
ltw tonight, held the balance In Min
nesota between Wilson and HuRhes.
Therefore the state was still classed
as doubtful, with predictions varying
widely as to the outcome of the
miardsmen's balloting and a rMl lif
fcrence of opinion over the number o(
votea cast under the absent voters
law.
latest returns gave Wilson 177.66!'
to Hughes 178,811. a Hughes plurality
of 604, in 3010 precincts. Of the mim
ing thirty-eight, ten are In Koochich
ing County and twelve in Beltrami
It la estimated tonight that it will
take three or four days to hear from
the former and nothing Is cxpeetod
from the latter before Monday. Both
counties were strongly Wllaon but the
missing precincts are not considerable
in poulation. Eight missing precinct?
in population. Eight missing precincts
l-.en gave a Hughes plurality.
