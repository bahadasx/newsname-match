LONDON, NOT. 11.—The great bat
tle between
RUSBO-Rumanian
There is still some doubt here as to
the sharp fiehtlng about Predeal. Both
sides claimed the advantage. The Ber
lin statement admitted the Transyl
vanian Rumanian armies adopted a
strong offensive, but that all attacks
were repulsed. Petrograd advices
said the Rumanians have all but com
pleted envelopment of the Teutonic
left flank.
In the territory about Dornavatra
id the Carpathian mountains, Russian
troops, according to Berlin, have de
veloped a powerful offensive. The Ber
lin announcement attaches much im
portance to their claim that terrific
Austrian counter attacks have chased
the Slavs from heights they took by
storm in three days of lighting ending
Friday. The menace a Russian
victory would be to General Falken-!an
hayn's rear at this point, has led to
the belief that the Teuton armies will
make a desperate stand.

President Wilson Likewise Is Worn
Out With the Campaign and
8everal Days of
Doubt.
i.By Carl D. Groat, United Press Staff

MSW YORK, Nov. 11.—Outwardly,
at least, Chas. Evans Hughes isn't
showing any signs of dl6«ppolntment
over indication that he has just lost
out on the biggest Job in America. The
man who said two days before the
election—"K I am elected—as I ex
pect to be"—and said it with convic
tion ringing in his voice—was just
as imperturbably unconcerned as
when a short six months ago he sat on
the bench of the supreme court of the
United States in judicial calm. There
was no doubt that Hughes was greatly
moved Wednesday when after he had
gone to bed Tuesday night convinced
he was elected, he awakened to find
his opponent chosen. But today he
had no signs of discomposure or dis
appointment
No one has been a' greater factor In
maintaining a smooth 'balance In the
Hughes camp than Mrs. Hughes,—her
husband's advisor, comforter and con
stant companion In all the hard work
of^the campaign. One thing that*.
Hughes has told his Mends warmed'
his heart greatly, was the handsome
majority which his own home state
of New Tork accorded him.
Neither Hughes nor his personal
staff have yet conceded Wilson's elec
tion. They are waiting for the offi
cial count They are particularly in
terested in the enormous Increase of
the California vote and it Is Bald a
quiet investigation is under way into
this. y,
Mr. and Mrs. Hughes probably will
remain at the Astor hotel for several
days and then depart to some quiet
spot nearby for rest It is probable
they will go to Mont Claire where
Hughes rested between several of his
campaign tours.
Wilson Also Needs Rest
[By Robert J. Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent]
WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass., Nov. 11.
—Glad the election is over. Presi
dent Wilson today took the first com
plete rest he has had since the open
ing of the campaign. During the day
he drove through the hUls and
planned to see a part at least of the
football game this afternoon between
Williams and the State agricultural
college. He will leave this afternoon
at 5:00 p. m. for Rhine Ciffs where he
boards the Mayflower for a cruise
down the Hudson. He expects to
come ashore Sunday for church and
auto ride. He will leave that aft
ernoon for Washington.
The president's friends are strong
ly urging him to take an extended
cruise on the Mayflower or go away
somewhere for a couple of weeks rest
before taking up official duties and
launching his contemplated- program
in congress. They say the strain of
the campaign has prevented him from
getting the rest he needed at Shadow
Lawn. The president has made no
definite program. He is delighted at
the prospect of having a working ma
jority in congress. Immediate action
will be urged on certain matters at
the first meeting of congress.

SiAN FRANOISOO. Nov. 11.—Until
the official canvass of the vote In all
counties In California has been com

Charles Brans Hughes may receive
at least some of Callifornda's thirteen
electoral votes.
In the face of returns from aH hut

wlhlch gave President Wllaotn a lead

and his associates made this state
meat today. They stated that while
they did not deny the general ac
curacy of the unofficial counts, the
Importance of California In determ
ining the whole national eleoiton
made it the port of wisdom to with
hold final judgment
Meantime a veritable tempest has
been stirred up In California circles
by the toss of the state to the demo
crats. Chairman Rtowell in a state
ment published today declared that
HugheB was 'defeated because he had
failed to* convince a. large minority of
progressives that he was tihs man
who should lead them.
"Incidents of the trip of Hughes to
California/' he said, "when he was
prevented reoognizing Governor Hir
am Johnson of* being recognized by
progressive leaders, was the climax
of the situation here." Rowell added
that Governor Hughes himself was
personally blameless In this connec
tion, saying those who managed his
trip here were responsible.
The .progressive leaders faithful
ly supported Hughes," he said, "and
succeeded In inducing the majority of
the progressives to follow theun. but
the minority, added to the labor vote
and the pacifists women's Vote,
turned the tide far Wilson."
One newspaper quotes Rowell as
declaring that from now oh the west
will dominate the nation's politics.
Replying to newspaper stories that
Hughes' "snubbing of Governor John
son" had defeated Hiughe® for the.
presidency, William H. Crocker, re

was mainly in charge of Hughes' Cal

never been any snub. He asserted
that he personally had Invited John

line to greet Hughes, but that Jolm
son had declined to go.

editorial declaring that Hughes was
"doulble crossed by the treachery of
the Johnson machine" and that this
machine "had stuck a knife into
Hughes and shamelessly flouted him."

Hughes Wants the Election afr
Wilson Confirmed Before
He Will Admit His
Defeat.
MIGHT BE A MISTAKE*
No Contests or Govt Action If
Final figures Are Sams as
the Unofficial
Totals.
[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent]
NBW TORK, Nov. 11.—Charles!
IBvana Hughes will let his telegram of
congratulations to Woodrow Wilson
await the official count of the votes In
California, New Mexico, North Dakota,
New Hampshire, and possible one or
two other states.
If the official count confirms the
Wilson victory, apparent now, It is the
republican nominee's wish—and he is
the one, who, being mainly concerned,
has the final say—that there he no
contest or court proceedings.
The reason the republicans still are
unwilling- to-eencede defeat Is that la,
the five states whose vote Is still in
complete a change of 8,000 votes might
mean a shift in the tide of victory
from Wilson to Hughes. Errors In
volving several thousand votes fre
quently are discovered In recounts.
The republicans hold they very easily
may have been made In the excite
ment of tabulating results of one of
the closest elections in American po
litlcal history.
In round figures, unofficial returns
show Wilson's lead In California about
3,300 in New Mexico, about 2,300 In
North Dakota, about 1,800 in Minne
sota, Hughes' lead about ffOO (with
the soldier vote still to be counted)
while In New Hampshire there is less
than 100 margin for Wilson. The
electoral vote of these states where
the margin is less than 8,000 votes,
totals -37. Hughes now has 247 votes In
the electoral college, about which there
is little doubt. The republicans figure
Minnesota will also be his, bringing
his total to 255. That Is eleven less
than the 266 majority required in the
electoral colleee. If a recount should
show New Hampshire republican,
bringing the republican total to 259
and Hughes should gain several of
California's electoral vabSa on a splift
of electors, possible under the stato
laws, h« would arrive at the place
where North Dakota's five votes, of
New Mexico's three recounted and
found republican might put him over*
instead of Wilson.
The endless conference of repubW*
can managers were \BttH on today.
There were a few recriminations as
to what the victorious democrats
faceticiously referred to as "the
wake," proceeded at the republican
headquarters, 'but for the most part
the leaders were planning reorganize*
