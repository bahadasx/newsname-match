DURING THE NEXT FEW YEARS.
WITH THE KEEN KINDS OF OTKLH
PLACES POINTING TO THE 0PF02-
TUNITIES BEFORE THIS TOWN,
HAYS IS ENJOYING THAT
LIMELIGHT.
It's Time To Get Busy.
(By P. Caspar Harvey)
The assertion that people outside of
Hays realize the future of Hays three
"deny it. And this denial proves t'aat
their denial is only another way of af
firming the original truth, 'neverthe
less. This is not saying in the least that
Hays or ' Hays folks do not realize the
future of the. town. It is saying, how
ever, that other people looking at Hays
with a perspective and from a distance
realize it more concretely than does
Hays itself.
Last week there, appeared an editorial
in the Salina Evening Journal that
showed - what Salina is actually think
ing. Before reading that editorial,
please note, it does not say "today,"
but distinctly "during the next few
years." So many Hays people ask the
short-nosed question "What will it pay
me, today?" This is the key to this
editorial. In other words Roy F. Bailey
and Roy Buckingham used their "vi
sion" when it was written. The edi
torial is a frank one. Salina is afraid
that Hays will become a menace to her
own commercial supremacy in Western
Kansas; and Mr. Bailey and Mr. Buck
ingham as the spokesmen for Safina,
can rest assured that Hay3 intends to
do this very thing. The wholesome
feeling between the two towns will of
course, continue to exist. Salina real
izes, as well, that the bigger Hays, the
bigger must Salina be. But Hays does
not wish for Salina to get the major
portion of the profit of that bigness.
"During the next few years" is the
refrain of a song of prophecy concern
ing Hays for which Hays is indebted to
i Salina. "During the next few years!"
ijut reaa tne entirei editorial irom
the November 3rd Journal:
TIME TO GET BUSY.
"Railroad development in Western!
Kansas during the next few years
threatens to cut off a slice of Salina's
trade territory unless something is
done.
"If the roads proposed s'juth from
Hutchinson to Hays and then north
! into Nebraska are built, this north west-
I era Kansas business seeking a south
j era outlet will be diverted through
points other than Salina. These roads
will contribute to the upbuilding of
that splendid western Kansas town,
Hays, as nothing else will. Salina de
sires to see Hays develop into an im
portant western Kansas town, but she
does not like to lose part of her trade.
"It is just a question of building the
first south road into Salina. Commodi
ties from northwestern Kansas arrive
here every day without an easy south
shipment that do not stay long. Kan-
sas City gets a bulk of the business be
i cause Kansas City is the only trading
; point that is accessible.
S "The other day several trainloads of
: stock passed through Salina to Kansas
, City. The owner said he pi ef erred to
sell them in Salina or some southern
I point like Wichita, but he could not
bill them there direct. His excuse was
good. Salina has no- southern outlet
ana sne neeas one Daaiy. witn an
other outlet south she can bolster up
her market and become more of a pack
ing center. That is the destiny of Sa
lina. With a great stock country at
her front door she should be able to
develop into one of the best packir.g
house centers of the state.
"All of this will come some day if we
wait until long enough. But why
wait? Why let other towns beat Salina
to. what she needs? Why be slothful
about building a city which has oppor
tunities to become a Western Kansas
leader. Plenty of pep and gogetjve
ness will cure the indifference of many
citizens. Let's make Salina one of the
Kansas cities which has enough back
bone and industry to take. leadership in
development.
Thanks.
I do hereby tendermy most siscere
thanks to the fireman of Hays for the
prompt and efficient manner in which
they responded last Tuesday afternoon
when my carpenter shop was on fire.
As it is my loss is about one hundred
dollars. But for their promptness and
efficiency, the loss .would have been
much heavier. Agaia.gajy thanks". -.

Concerning The Golden Belt Teacher :
which came from the press last week !
The Free Press has clipped from among '
its exchanges these comments: !
"In commendation of the Golden Belt
Teacher, an educational monthly pub- I
Iished at Hays under the management :
of P. Caspar Harvey of the Fort Hays
Normal, Judge J. C. Ruppenthal of j
Russell, savs: For a great emoire like '
I the west half of Kansas, the new Gold- !
; en Belt Teacher should be an invaluable
magazine in educational circles. The j
i forty-seven counties in the Golden Beit J
j District can make many pages of inter- j
; esting news each month and P. Caspar
j Harvey is the man to get it." The '
Kansas City Star. j
j " Volume 1, No. 1 of the Golden Belt j
j Teacher, a magazine devoted to the in- '
tcrests of the Golden Belt Educational j
Association in the western part of
Kansas, has been received in Topeka. '
The magazine is well written j
and carries a liberal supply of advertis- i
ing. The contributors are for the ;
most part well known school workers
of the western part of the state." The
Topeka Daily Capital.
"P. Caspar Harvey has started the
Golden Belt Teacher at Hays, Kansas,
and the fact that Caspar is running it
is guarantee enough that it will be
j alive." The Oakley Graphic.

In
this AFTERMATH.
The feud or vindetta we had supposed
was a relic of barbarism, bat some
men, even in this enlightened age, will
resort, not to the knife or rifle, but to
vilification, vituperation and innuendos
of a poisonous nature, to kill hi3 neigh-,
bor, not physically, but to ruin his rep
tution and his business. Such a man
is as guilty, in his heart, as the man
who deliberately takes his neighbor's
life.
The re-elected republican officers owe
their success largely to xhe loyal sup
port of the people of Ellis. To the
gentlemen and ladies of Ellis we tip
our hat. Whatever the west end of
the county should want in the way of
political preferment the Free Press
stands ready to boost.
The Deiilahs of Kansas have turned
the state oveE to the Philistine. ---r.
"He kept us out of war." At the
dawn of creation the woman fell for the

not to have profited by experience to
any great extent by the lapse of time.
It ha3 been thousands of years since
the incident in the Garden of Eden.

The New Motion Picture House.
M. G. Kirkman has broke ground for
the basement for his moving picture
house near the Windsor Hotel on North
Chestnut Street. The buildiug will be
50x75 feet, one story of twenty-one feet
in the clear, with basement the full
size of the building. It is understood
that the basement will be used for rest
rooms, toilet, etc., and perhaps a read
ing room will be added. Everything
possible wiil be done for the comfort
, , . . . . ,
house. Two machines will be installed
so that there will be no waiting for
shjfting the film3 between acts, but the
pictures will be continuous as they are
in the cities. Upholstered chairs will
be furnished throughout, in fact, they
are already purchased. A costly screen
of glass mirrors is now at the depot, on
which the pictures will be shown. The
latest electrical appliances will be in
stalled. Everything right up to the
minute will be Mr. Kirkman's watch
word. Carl Befort has sold a half interest
in his fruit and confectionary store on
Chestnut Street to his brother, and
has accepted a position with the whole
sale establishment of W. O. Anderson
on North Main Street. And by the
way, the Anderson wholesale establish
ment is doing a surprising amount of
business. The firs" of last week Mr.
Benton, the manager, stated to a Free
Press reporter, that one day recently
their local business reached over $7000,
besides three cars of produce that were
not billed out. from this point, which
would bring the busines3 of the one day
up to at least 512,000. That i3 goine
some for a town the size of Hays, and
the short time which the business has
been established.
