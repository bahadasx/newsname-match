courts the legal giants of both par?
ties were being marshalled for such

At 10 o'clock President Wilson had

it will probably ?tili be another day,
before the full reports are known from
any of the four States left in the doubt?

change in States could in no wise
result there may be no Ue
VirtuaUy all the States whore the
result is close are carried in the
Hughes column and for that reason
the Democrats profess to be not ap?
prehensive that any overturning could
come from a recount.
The Democratic national committee
gave out the following statement when
'the result In California became
known:
"The president has carried the
county by a popular plurality of from
200,000 to 300,000. With an electoral
vote of 272 absolutely sure, and with
Minnesota, West Virginia and New
Hampshire still to be decided to say
there will be a contest is an insult to
the Intelligence of the American peo?
ple,
"There is nothing to add to our
statements previously made. We have
claimed the re-election of President
Wilson since early Tuesday evening;
we knew he had it. We have been
fighting especially for the Western
States."
Chairman McCormick left Demo?
cratic headquarters at'11:30 o'clock
laying that he was satisfied that the
president had been reclected.
When the Associated Press inform?
ed Democratic headquarters that
President Wilson had carried Califor?
nia there was wild cheering and the
crowd of workers who had been <?n

and two nights seemed to forgot they
were weary. The street in front Of
headquarters had been blocked all the
evening with crowds cheering for Wil?

After theatre crowds were thronging
Broadway and adjacent street! in the
white light district when beams Ol
light from a search lights In the tow?

cheering and several impromptu pa?

The straight Democratic tick. t.
State and national, was an easy win?
ner in Buinter county, as had been
generally expected. The vote was
larger than usual, both the Demo?
cratic and Republican parties pott*
tog more \vdes than customary in a
general election. In fact the size of
the Republican vote was the occasion
for considerable comment. In the cny
the Democratic veto WmM about two
thirds of the primary vote, while in
the county precincts the vote was
about the same as is usually cast in
ft general election. Only about half
( f the ruial precincts have been heard
from yet.
The State ticket was voted general?
ly, but there weie a number of the
Beard-Blease ballots cast both in the
city and in the rural precincts. In
other cases there were a number Jf
the regular Democratic tickets voted
on which the name of R. L Man?
ning had been obliterated and Cole L.
Bl0000*1 name written in its place, as
the nominee for governor. However,
the voters of the Beard tickets and
of the Blea.se tickets did not show
their tickets in voting, in every caso
bringing them to the polls with them,
and they could be detected In many
instances for this reason.
The total vote of seven precincts
heard from ou the State ticket ghe
Manning 870 ,votes, Blease 62, and
Cantey, the Bull Moose candidate,
2 votes. The straight Democratic
ticket was voted for each of tho
other nominees of the parties, except
that in a few instances individuals

MBflttiicial amendments the vote wan

cast for the Democratic electors, 126

Chicago, Nov. H.?Out of the maze
of uncertainty surounding the presi?

boldly?more than half the States of
of the country are now dry. Territo?
rially speaking 7 5 per cent, of the
area of the United States has banned
i f
liquor. Six States were added to the
dry column: Michigan, Nebraska,
South Dakota, Montana. Utah and
Florida. Prohibition roiled up such
decisive majorities that the leaders
declare the election four years from
now will swoop the country entirely
