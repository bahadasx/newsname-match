of Ghisdarechti and Topal.

Mackensen Continues Retreat.
LONDON*. November 11. 12:10 p.m.?A
Bucharest dispatch as forwarded from
Rome to the Wireless Press reports
that Field Marshal von Mackensen's
retreat in Dobrudja is continuing and
that the Bulgarian population is fleeing
.from Dobrudja to Bulgaria.
The dispatch says great fires have
been observed in the direction of
Tchernavoda and Oonstanza on the railroad
between the Black sea and the
Danube and it is thought possible
these towns have been set on fire preparutorj*
to their evacuation by the
Teutonic forces. '
Dobrudja Again in Balance.
The issue in Dobrudja, where RussoRumanian
forces apparently are attempting
to regain possession of the
Constanza-Tchernavoda railroad line,
seems again to hang in the balance.
Russo-Rumauian troops are advancing
from the north upon Field Marshal
von Mackensen's left flank at Tchernavoda
and other entente forces are close i
to the town along the route of the ;
twelve-mile-long bridge and viaduct 1

lands west of the main stream.
Conflict in Beports.
Sofia reports under Friday's date that j
Bulgarian artillery compelled entente |
troops which had advanced to the west j
bank of the Danube t"o "retire toward j
Dunareav." Petrograd, on the other j
hard, yesterday announced the occu- j
pat ion of this town by the Russians, J
locating it two miles west of Tcherna- j
voda, which is taken to mean that the j
Russians are approximately at the end j
of that portion of the bridge which
spans the main stream.
. The news that fighting is again in
progress around the great Tchernavoda.
bridge is the most interesting item of
this morning's war news. The Russian
official communication reporting
that Russian infantry and cavalry have
occupied Dunareav station on the west
side of the Danube two miles from
Tchernavoda is the first news that the
Bulgar-German forces have crossed the
main stream of the Danube.
According to I.ondon commentators
the Russian force threatening the
bridge now is not a part of Gen.
JiakharoJTs army in Dobrudja, but is a
separate operation from the direction
of Bucharest and is aimed at P'ield
AJarshal von Mackertsen's left flank.
The Russian Black sea fleet has bombarded
Consianza and Mangalia, Rumania,
causing heavy damage, according
tc Keuter's Petrograd correspondent.

DEMOCRATIC PARADE I

the returning and re-elected President, i
those in charge of the proposed pageant c
have decided to hold it later in the 1

The tentative ?ate now is Thursday, s
but until CharlesMjV". Parr, chairman of <
the Wilson and ^Marshall Democratic <

I dent's secretary, Joseph P. Tumulty, *

1 However, there is no doubt that the *
parade will be held, and that it will be l
an illuminated procession, flanked by
colored fire, and made loud and bois- J
terous by bands and offset by fire- l
I works. 1
Robert N. Harper, who will act as !
grand marshal, today picked Melvin C. j
Hazen and Alvin G. Dent as his aids j
j and began the work of lining up the
j various organizations which have sent
i word they wanted to join the proces!
sion. Thousands of individual applications
from government clerks have re- t
suited in a section of the parade to be
given over to the various government t
departments, and Mr. Harper today is e
sending out letters asking every or- 0
ganization, department or bureau just p
how many men will appear. Two thou- ^
sand navy yard men have asked for n
places and several organizations of j,
women also have made request. There n
probably will be 700 women in line, j Q

Recommendations for the honor of be- "aj
ing chairman of the inaugural committee s<
to have charge of the celebration in Wash- s<
ington March 5 were made today to Vance
McOormick, chairman of the democratic p
national committee. This was learned in ei
a long-distance telephone conversation *
with the New York headquarters. Mr.
McCormick is expected to come to Washington
Monday, at which time he and d
John F. Costello. th ? national commit- a!
tee man from the District of Columbia,
probably will urge upon President Wilson
the desirability of promptly naming the
inaugural chairman.
There is no avowed candidate for the o
position. Resides Robert N. Harper, ; t.
suggested yesterday, Charles W. Darr, !
president of the District of Columbia j 81
Wilson and Marshall League, is men- a
tinned. j ^
Hotels Booking Reservations. id
Proprietors of all the prominent Wash- 1 v
ington hotels today continued to receive !
inquiries regarding reservations for the i j'
inaugural festivities. That this incom- j v,
Ing of guests is representative of the ! d
entire citizenship of the United States Is ' ?
I i
shown by the fact that not one of the i g
applications thus far has been for any j ?,
large party or political organization, j t!
They are mostly family groups, and i j,
these applications are received from all j c
over the country, but especially from j a
the far west.
Those familiar with the crowds" at j c
previous inaugurations say the attend- | j
ance from the west in previous years j t:
has not been especially heavy. They j 0
believe the inquiries show that the \ c
western states which have swung al- c
most as a solid unit into the demo- j }
cratic column are going to take Wash- : s
ington by storm and crowd into the v
capital to celebrate the victory in j
? Uiv.ll iuc> wwiv cv vwnoyn.u?us u pai i. j j(
To Honor Miss Kankin.
Woman suffrage organizations are
understood to be making extensive
plans in the western states for organized
participation in the inaugural festivities.
It is said that there will he probably
a suffrage parade here irt honor
of the Congressmiss-elect Jeannette
Rankin, elected from Montana.
Suffrage leaders have receved letters
and telegrams from organizations in
several of the woman suffrage states
volunteering to march in such a pageant.
Whether or not there will be a
woman suffrage parade, there will certainly
will be a suffrage demonstration,
and many marching organizations of
suffragists are coining to Washington.

G.O.P.IN APPARENT
GONTROLOF HOUSE
Has 216 Seats Against 214
for Democrats, According to
Latest Returns.
HINGES ON FOUR OTHERS
In a struggle which has the same
Iramatic elements which marked the
Ight for the presidency, the republican
larty today seems to have won control
?f the House of Representatives, as the
atest returns give the republicans 215
;eats, democrats 214, progressives 2,
socialist 1 and independent 1, with a
lemocrat leading in the one missing
listrict in New Mexico. Should the re>ublicans
retain this l<>ad, the next big
iglit will be for the organization of
he lower body, including the speakership,
committee chairmanships and the
jreat patronage pay roll which supjorts
1,500 House employes.
The one missing district is New Mexco.
which returns two senators, but
>nly one representative. In that widey
scattered field they still are counting
rotes, and the latest message gives
he democratic candidate, Walton, a
ead of 1.776 votes over the republican
ncumbeut, Representative Hernandez,
s'inety-six precincts were missing.
Skillful Maneuvering- Anticipated.
"There is no doubt that the fight for
he control of the House vill be one of
he most skillfully maneuvered battles
ver seen in the Capitol. The absence
f a single member will be enough,
erhaps. to determine which party shall
e in the ascendency. The death of a
lember Letv een now and the gatherng
of the Sixty-fifth Congress also j
iav decide the question as to a divided j
r united congress, rne entire history |
f the country for the next four years
lay be in the hands of a single memer
at any time, and perhaps the balance <
hall be controlled by Miss Jeannette
tankin, the Montana republican, first
oman ever to be elected to the United '
tates Congress.
The two progressives a^e Represontaive
Schall of Minnesota and Renr^entative
Martin of Louisiana. Repreentative
Schall has more of a repubican
tinge to his affiliation than
theruuse, and Representative Martin
i a progressive simply because of the
eeling in his district against the
emocratic redaction of the tariff. He
robablv is a democrat when it corn's
o lining up for the organization of the j
louse. Representative London the i
'ew York socialist, affiliates with the
emocrats for organization purpos s In
he present House, and may be looked
pon as more help to the democrats
han to the republicans.
Fuller May Swing the House.
Alvan T. Fuller, the Massachusetts in(.-pendent,
who furnished one of the
lection surprises by beating Repre^ntative
Roberts, a strong feptlbean,
may lean one way or the other
rid the decision as to who will con-ol
may rest with him.
He ran as an independent, but in realy
is a dyed-in-the-wool progressive,
e is absolutely independent in politics
nd took it up because he was disgusted
ith the actions of some of the old
uard politicians, both republican and .
:-mocratic.
Two years ago he made his first apearance
in politics as a candidate for
legislature from Maiden as a proressive,
and he was elected. He served :
ne term and did not run again. In j
le legislature he was absolutely inde- !
endent. When he makes up his mind I
11 a matter influence cannot swerve
im. This year he stuck to the pro-J
ressive ship. He was one or trie two i
rogressives elected to the convention '
t Chicago, and he voted for Koosevelt
II the time. Representntive Roberts
ierned to have the ninth Massachuitts
In his vest pocket, so strongly
lat the democrats did not bother to
ominate any one against him. A couie
of weeks ago Mr. Fuller decided to
titer the fight more as a protest
gainst Roberts than with the expec
tion of winning.
Then the democrats rallied to Fulrr's
support and ex-Gov. Walsh inorsed
him. Prominent progressives
Iso did the same.
Support Eagerly to Be Sought.
It is certainly true that the support
f these four members, who really con-ol
the balance of power, will be
ought by both of the large parties,
nd that they may live in clover and [
elight between now and the time they
ecide just how they will throw their
otes for the control of the House.
The figures which give the repubeans
the control arc subject to change,
owever. The best judgment of men j
matching the returns from the slow t
istricts is that the republicans will
ave 216 to the democrats' possible 215.
he count up to a late hour last night
ave an even break, with 216 on either j
ide. However, dispatches today say
hat Representative Britt, republican,
as won by fourteen votes in North
arolina, which gives the republicans
lead. i
In the Britt district there will be a
ontest after the House is organized,
here also will be contests in the Mar- |
in district in Louisiana, and several;
timers from clo^e districts. These may
hange the majority figures, but the I
on tests are not. made until after the j
louse is organized. There is a posibility,
therefore, that the republicans
ill control, with three or four more
emocrats than republicans, but this is
oubtful. ;

t
By the Associated Press. S
LONDON, November 11.?Fighting on f
the Somme front in northern France, with *
the return of more favorable weather con- p
ditions, apparently has been resumed on ^
an Increasingly Important scale.
The war office announces the storming *
last night by British troops on the eastern *
portion of the Regina trench, on the j
northern portion of the front, along a line A
more than half a mile in length. The *
French have been active south of the ^
river, where Berlin scmi-offlcially admits
they have scored some successes, which f
are characterized, however, as insignifi- 1
cant. In this same region northeast of s
Chauines Paris reports an attack by the c
Germans last night in the Deniecourt sec- t

night entered an advanced German position.
the war office reports today.
| Berlin newspapers publish a statement
from "competent military author.
ities saying the Anglo-French drive on
| the Somme has been halted by the exI
haustion of the entente troops and
their heavy losses and by unfavorable
weather. The statement says:
! "After the tremendous losses sustained
by the British and French on
November o. when they employed six
British and four and a half French di- !
visions without success in an attempt
to break our front between Le Sars
and Bouchavesnes, they have been unable
to drive forward for large attacks
their exhausted and decimated
troops over ground made impracticable
hv rain. All a.ttemi?fH have been
stifled immediately by the fire of our
artillery and machine guns and only
south of the Soinme near Pressoire did
the French obtain insignificant local .
successes.
Repeated Attacks Crushed.
"Attacks launched repeatedly Wednesday
in St. Pierre Vaast wood, although
continued until late in the night, were ,
crushed by the tenacious resistance of '
the German troops. With the clearing
of the weather the artillery became
more active, but the British and French
were unable to make a general attack.
"Fighting on Thursday resulted in
Isolated violent encounters near Kaucourt
L'Abbaye, Gusudecou t. j^es
Boeufs and Pressoire, the entente attacks
being stifled by the German Are.
In the vicinity of Sailly-Saillisel fierce
fighting was renewed. French siorming
columns made powerful attacks and
were repulsed in sanguinary hand-tohand
fighting. About Pressoire the
fighting continued until evening, when
it ended without success for the
French.
"Among seventeen hostile airplanes
shot down on the western front was
one large battle plane, provided with
two motors and three machine guns.
The airplane carried three men. We
captured it undamaged." j

ORDERS RETIREMENT
FORGMEMLS
War Department Acts Upon
Request of Governor General
of Canal Zone.
EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 15
An order issued at the War Department
today places Alaj. Gen. George W. Goethals,
governor general of the Panama
uanai z*one, on tne reiirea list or rue
army, to take effect next Wednesday, November
15, after foVty years of service.
That action was taken on the application
of Gen. Goethals, with the approval
of the President and in conformity with
special legislation of Congress.
Although Secretary Baker said today
that no order had been issued retiring
Gen. Goethals of his civil function as
governor of the Canal Zone on the date
of his transfer to the retired list, it is
assumed that that course will be followed
as soon as the matter has been
brought to the attention of the President.
In fact. Secretary Baker said
that it was for the President alone to
say when Gen. Goethals shall be relieved
from duty as governor and who
shall be appointed to the vacancy thus
created.
It /s known that Gen. Goethals desired
to be relieved from the governorship
at the President's convenience and
to be transferred to the retired list of
the army at the same time, in order
that he might take a short rest and
then engage in other employment.
Col. Harding- Now in Charge.
With that idea in view and at his
suggestion, Col. Chester Harding of the
Corps of Engineers, then Engineer
Commissioner of the District, was sent
to the zone as engineer of maintenance
of the canal severat 3'ears ago
in order to familiarize himself with the
situation gene-ally, so that he might
tfllfn llr? tV?o i)nti<iO ' f cr/M
relinquished by Gen. Goethals. Col.
Harding: now is acting governor of the
zone and undoubtedly will be appointed
as Gen. Goethals' successor as governor.
Gen. Goethals now is in this country
on leave of absence arranging for the
discharge of his new duties as chairman
of the eight-hour labor commission
recently appointed by the President
to review the effects of the Adamson
bill. His retirement from active
military duty will in no way interfere
with the performance of those purelycivic
duties.
FOE HALF-HOLIDAY PLAN.
Eev. Dr. Van Schaick Strongly Indorses
the Saturday Proposal.
Indorsement of the Saturday halfholiday
plan for government employes
was given this afternoon by Rev. Dr.
John Van Schaick, president of the board
of education. Dr. Van Schaick stronglyindorsed
the proposition, with especial
reference to the public schools.
"I have always taken the position
that government clerks should have half
holiday on Saturday, and I cou'd not be
consistent if I did not favor this for employes
of the public schools as for em
'""jca in uiuci uittiivuco *-?? tuo buvciu*
ment," he said. "The schools are certainly
a part of the government. and in
view of this the employes in them are
entitled to half holiday if clerks in other
branches receive it."

EXIRA SESSION NOT
CONSIDERED LIKELY
The President's Re-Election
Thought Here to Mean Closing
of Congress March 4.
LAWS NOW IN GOOD SHAPE
President Wilson's re-election is generally
understood in Washington to
mean that there will be no extra session
of Congress at the close of the coming
short session.
The election of Hughes, it was conceded,
would have led to an extra session
for the revision r the tariff and
other legislative changes to accord with
republican views.
Only serious changes in the relations

in his campaign speeches, declared that
the democratic administration had safeguarded
the country against "dumping"
and disastrous tariff competition
through legislative provisions that he
believed to be competent to care for
the anticipated dangers after the ending
of the war in Europe.
The President has, it is said, no reason
to change his mind on the tariff
for a while to come, at least. The tariff
commission provided by the democrats
will get to work in a short time,
and this organization, together with
the "anti-dumping" law, is regarded
as sufficient to care for the country's
interests until changing conditions demand
important changes. The administration.
as well known, has also taken
the position that no sane man can now
tell what ought to be done with the
tariff and that only the future will indicate
the course the democrats should
take on that Question. The European
war may completely revolutionize ideas
as to tariff problems, according to many
democrats.
Country Tires of Congress.
As to legislation generally. President
Wilson lias indicated in speeches that
the democratic administration has
given the country about all the important
legislation it needs and he is
likely to construe his re-election as
authority from the people to stand
pat and not worry about putting so
many new laws on the books. Many
democrats contend that the country
has been getting tired of too much
Congress and that it will welcome a
let-up in the work of that body.
The legislative program of the administration
was virtuallv comnleted
at the last session. A number of important
bills were left hanging in one
or the other hous s of Congress, v ut
they were not administration bills T e
bill for vocational education pass d the
Kcnate, but did not get through the
Tha- -iiRiiaisxatipn bill went
through the Ho^se, hut v as hung up
in the Senate. The corrupt practic a
act of Senator Owen of Ok la oma
threatened to prevent the adjournment
of Congress, but he was prevailed upon
to ease up in his efforts.
President Wilson will begin work in
the next week upon his annual recommendations
to Congress. Nobody is
authorized to speak for him, but it is
generally believed that his annual address
will be the least important of
any he has made to Congress during
his first term in the White House. It
is presumed that the President will
urge Congress to complete his proposed
legislation regarding strikes in
this country, especially that portion
I designed to force a complete investii
gation before a strike is permitted to
. occur. He declared this to be his purI
pose in a number of speeches made
I during the campaign, when his settlement
of the railroad strike was being
so roundly criticised.
Prohibitionists to Be Active.
The success of the prohibitionists in
adding four more states to the "dry"
column'means incessant effort by prohibitionists
from now on to force a
change in the Constitution forbidding
the manufacture and sale of liquors in
this country, according to all predictions
today. Word came to Washington
today that senators and repxesenta
tives rrom promotion suites are already
preparing their fight from the
start of the coming short session.
They may not hope to achieve results
in the three months of that session,
but they will pave the way for the supreme
efforts they will make at the
next long session of Congress. The
prohibitionists are today contending
that with the addition of the four new
states to the dry column 60 per cent of
the area of the United States is "dry"
and that more of it is tending that
way. Twenty-four of the forty-eight
states of the Union are now in the dry
ranks.
That the prohibition legislators will
! attempt to force prohibition upon the
j District of Columbia has been settled
for some time. Their strength in the
' Senate will have grown considerably
even at the short session. Nobody looks
for a let-up in the fight to make the
capital of the nation "dry" territory.
There is an earnest hope on the part
of the best citizens of the District that
President Wilson will now begin to
' give greater thought and heartier sym;
pathy to the affairs of the people of
the capital. There has been much rei
cent talk of having a delegation of
leading citizens from the District visit
President Wilson in the near future
and talk frankly to him about the District,
asking his aid for the capital
i against those who are more interested

Charles E. Hughes in the national election.
the latest returns today in the
close states of California, Minnesota,

Mr. Wilson still led in California,
New Mexico and Npw Hampshire, and
Mr. Hughes in Minnesota, with only a
few districts yet to be accounted for in
each state.
I-ater Chairman Willcox gave out this
statement:
'The n clonal committee is not raising
the cry of fraud nor is it going out

any number of communications, signed

"The national committee is simply in
the same position as state officials, who
are waiting for the result of tho official
count and whose duty it is to eeri
tify what electors have been chosen."
Mr. Willeox added that he believed
, there is much less opportunity for fraud
now than there used to oe.
I Concerned Over Congress.
1 President Wilson in Williamstown,
Mass., was reported to be chiefly concerned
over the complexion of the next
Congress, which was still in doubt today.
The President's plurality over Mr.
Hughes in the total popular vote, according
to the latest estimates, based
upon incomplete returns, is 403,312. His
total vote was 8,563,713 and that of Mr.
Hughes, 8,160,401.
Chairman Willeox Firm.
Chairman Wilcox was on duty again
at the republican committee's headquarters
today, but said he had nothing
to add to his statement yesterday in
which he announced that the re-electiqn
of President Wilson would not be
conceded until after the official count
In California, and perhaps other close
stated. Mr. Willeox said he expected
to call on Charles E. Hughes during
the day.
George W. Perkins conferred yesterday
afternoon with Mr Hughes. He
stated that no definite decision had
been reached by party managers in regard
to demanding a recount in California,
New Mexico and North Dakota.
He intimated action probably would be
deferred until the official count ill
those states was completed, in the
hope that there might be an overturn
of the comparatively slender Wilson
pluralities.
NEW HAMPSHIRE GOES
FOR PRESIDENT WILSON
CONCORD. N. H., November 11.?
President Wilson received a plurality
of sixty-three votes over Charles E.
Hughes in New Hampshire, according
to certified returns from all except one
small precinct made public by Secretary
of State Bean today. In arriving
at this figure, Mr. Bean announced, he
included in the Wilson total 289 votes
cast for him in ward 2, Dover, but
omitted through error from the certified
returns and by accepting as probably
correct the newspaper returns
from Dorchester, the missing precinct,
which had not reported officially.
The newspaper returns from Dorchester
gave Hughes S3 and Wilson IS.
Party leaders said there was no reason
to question these figures, although the
election managers in that precinct
were instructed today to expedite their
report.

Analysis by democratic leaders to?iip?**
of the popular presidential vote in San

agement to the claim of the republican
state central committee that a split

votes, only 411 behind Francis J. Honey,
