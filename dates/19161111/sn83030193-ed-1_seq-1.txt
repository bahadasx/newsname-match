SOLDIERS' FIELD, CAMDMDGB. Mass., Nov. 11. Harvard and
Princeton met here to-day on a hard, dry field, under the most perfect
.!), rnndltlonB possible. Perhaps down thore In the bowl, with no
cool breczo blowing, the players didn't think so much of the beautiful sky
and tho clear sunshine. Thero was heat In the aun, and the moleskins
and woollen Jerseys mado each man feci llko a soldier on tho hike In
Mexico.
Thero were 40.000 on hand when the
gamo started at 2 o'clock.
At 1 o'clock tho full Harvard squad
camo out for a warming up practice.
The great stands were nearly empty,
only dotted with a few -stray thou
sands who had come early. On the.
browit field tho player broke up Into
groups, somo practicing passing,
others kicking Koals or punting. Prom
the top of tho hlch stadium wall they
looked llko midgets or moro llko
warrior ants or beetles In their glis
tening black leather head gears.
Tho jlver Charles, curving around
the stadium to tho north, was blue
rs a tropic sea. Across tho brldgo u
solid column of spectators marched.
Long lines of automobiles rolled
down the roads to the river to bo
parked cn tho river banks.
Suddenly there was a roar from tho
Mattered crowd of Tiger rooters as
the
Princeton tenm ran out on mo
field
The Harvard men gathered
a. sauad and marchod off, po-
Into
miv o-lvlncr thn TlKcrs elbow room.
In a few minutes it would be nulto
different. Thero would bo no cere
monial making way for Princeton
then.
Tho Tigers took possession of tho
field and warmed up In turn. Soon
they finished ami retreated, leaving
only half a dozen men cheerfully kick
ing field goals. Among them was Tib
bett In full uniform.
Among thorn wns a player with Tib
belt's number, H, on his Jersey. Ho
kicked several field goals, sending tho
ball neatly over tho mldlo of tho bar.
This looked odd, after a report Just
from tho Princeton headquartors that
Tlbbott was Just recovering from a
dlslocatod knee. Hut It was rumored
that "No. 14" was another player,
Haarcn, In Tlbbott's Jersey.
RIVAL ROOTERS SEND UP
CHEERS FOR OPPOSING TEAMS.
It was u few minutes beforo gumo
tlmo and tho bunds began to play,
In tho middle of tho llrst song thero
was a great roar from tho Crimson
stands and the Harvard squad camo
rushing out upon tho Held. Iinmedl
ntelv thov broko up Into three teams
and rushed through a sorlcs of pluys
llko a tlghtor shadow boxing beforo a
real contest. Two or threo minutes
minutes of this and then nil tho subs
left tho field and a moment! Inter tho
Prlncoton squad ran Into the gate
way, Tho Prlncoton rooters stood up nn.l
barked a short cheer for Harvard.
They ended with the Tlgers's roar
for tho Ornngo and Illi.ck, While the
din was at Its height tho megaphone

BOMBARDS CONSTANZA
DEMOCRATS NOW HAVE 216
CONGRESS SEATS, WHICH GIVES
CONTROL BY
Wilson Got 8,563,713 Direct Votes and
Hughes 8,160,410,GivingthePresi-
dent a Popular Plurality of 403,312
Biggest Showing in History.
SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Nov. 11. With all hut thirteen California pre
cincts heard from, Wilson was leading Hughes 3,021 votes, on tho face
of returns to-day, at 11.30 A. M. (Wcstorn tlmo). Tho totals wero:
Wilson, 465,887, and Hughes, 402,260. This Includes slight revisions In
several precincts.
With these now returns thore
votes In the lira districts canvassed.
Natlonal Chairman Wlllcox and Charles E. Hughos outwardly main
tained to-day their position that they cannot admit tho ro-clcctlon of
Provident Wilson until tho voto has been officially counted In California
and New Hampshire Mr. Wlllcox docs not charge that thero has hcen
any fraud, although ho eays ho has received many charges by mall and
telegraph, mostly anonymous, which havo boon referred to tho Chairmen
ot State Committees.
Now Hampshire went definitely Into1-
tho Democratic column to-day when
Secretary of State Iioan announced In
Concord that Wilson's plurality, with
only one proclnct missing In Dorches
ter, Is 63 votes. All tho voto has been
certified except that of tho missing
proclnct, and that, tho Secretary of
Stato says, la probably truly rocordod
in tho unofllclal roturns.
National Chairman Vance McCor
mlclc went to Hnrrlsburg to-day, but
will return Monday to take up the
work of collecting ICOO.OOO which the
Domocratlc National Commlttea owes.
Ho thinks ho can ralso the money.
LITTLE CHANCE THAT THERE
WILL DC A RECOUNT.
In their determination to hold that
Wilson has sot been re-elected, Mr,
Hughes and Mr. Wlllcox stand alone
among tho leaders of their party.
Frank Hitchcock, compared with
whom both aro amateurs In national
politics, has conceded tho Democratic
victory. Tho hope that thore may
havo been errors In computation of
tho voto sufficient to awing ten elec
toral votes is looked upon by Mr.
Hitchcock and other Itopubllcan
leaders of cxpcrlonco as bordering
on foollBh optimism. President Wil
son has a margin of ten votes, with
tho twelve votes of Minnesota loom
Ing largo In tho near political futuro.
Summed up, It would be seen that
thero will not bo a demand for a re
count. President Wilson gained S49 votes
In Mlnnosota this nftcrnoon when the
offlolal count of llamsoy County dls
closed that Hughes had been credited
with votes that wont to tho Demo
cratic candidate. This cuts Hughes's
lead in Minnesota down to 218, with
twenty-ntno precincts missing with
In the Stato and tho soldier voto and
absentee travelling men nnd railroad
men voto still to bo r-j'ited.
I Mr. Wlllcox took some satisfaction
' yesterday In returns showing that the
j Republicans would control the next
House of ItopreJientatlvos. To-day's
