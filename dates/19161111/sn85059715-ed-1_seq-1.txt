THE HAOUE, Netherlands, Nov.
11.?About 2,000 unemployed in the
Belgian city of Ghent have been deported
to Germany for work in munition
factories, according to news from
the frontier. A compulsory registration
of unemployed took' place a fewdays
since, and the present labor compulsion
is the sequel thereto. Former
employes of various engineering
works at Ghent who gave.no heed to
the call, were seized in their beds at
night by German soldiers and thrown
into prison, it is alleged.
Other instances of the imposition
of forced labor have recently occurred
aiou at xji ugco, JUCA1W, VjIiUIll,

that Germany is determined, so far
as possible, to utilize the considerable
supply of Belgian labor to make
good the ever-Increasing military
drain on its own man power.
