effect an early adjustment of the prob

Until official reports revealed the
truth of stories of Villa's succcsses in

south, thero appeared a probability
that an agreement would tie entered
Into perhaps next week. That ap->
peared less likely t o-d<iy, and the
chance that a formal adjournment
without agreement other than one of
the most general character seemed
more probable.

from official Mvurces, and others re
ceived hy the Mexicans from their gov

Villa, were studied at the conference
of the commissioners at their one lon^

comparison of the reports was to dis
close that General Carranza Is now
conducting a defensive campaign

Republican national headquarters

apparently regards the campaign as

ItHSlI.T STH.I. DEPENDS
ON VOTE IN CI.OSE STATES
National Chairman William R. Will
cox, following a conference of the
j campaign managers to-day, refused to
concede the election of President Wll
' son. In a formal statement he de
clared that the result still depends on
the \otc of close States, and that tho
i returns from these were so far un
official. and might be chunked by the
; official count. Mr. Willcox stated,
however, that the national committee
i would abide by the decision of the of
j Ib-ial count, unless special circum
stance:! arose which made other action
j necessary.
This was tho Important development
in the presidential election situation

, leading by 75-. but the figures for New
Hampshire apparently put Wilson,
ahead, while he also led in New
Mexico.
Chairman Willcox, in a formal state*
1 ment issued after a conference with
other Republican campaign managers,
i said that the result still depends upon
the vote of a few close States, and"
; that the returns thus far announced are
in most States unnftlcial. and may be
changed by the offieiui count.
"The result still depends upon tha
votes of a few close States," Mr. Will*
eox's statement read. "It must he
borne in mind that the returns thus
far announced are in most States un
