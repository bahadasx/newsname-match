MISSOULA, Mont., Nov. II.—"I am going to
Washington to represent the women and children of
tHP West—to work tor an eight-hour day for women,
and for laws providing that women shall be paid the
same wages as men for equal amounts of work."
Miss Jeanette Rankin, newly elected republican
congressman—or "congresswoman"—from Montana,
was sewing as she said this today.
Even after entering politics she refused to for
sake the old household arts, cooking and needlework.
Miss Rankin failed to become excited when return
showed she was running ahead of the republican ticket
and later that she was elected.

DANUBE BRIDGE
IS PRIZE BOTH
SIDES FIGHT FOR
LONDON, Nov. it. —The great battle between
Russo-Rumanian forces and Mackenzen's troops in the
Dobrudja for possession of the bridge that crosses the
Danube at Cernavoda continues.
Advices from Bucharest, Petrograd and Berlin,
regarding yesterday's fighting, emphasize this conflict
as the most important operation of the day on any of
the many fronts.
Occupation of the Dunereav station, about two
miles due west of Cernavoda, as claimed by Petro
grad and not denied from Berlin, appears to have given
the Slavonic armies at least a temporary advantage in
their efforts to press back or envelop Mackenzen's
left flank, which rests on the Danube.
Military experts here say a Slav i
success at this point would change
the complexion of the nobrudja;
front materially, with great dlsad
vantage to the Teuton*.
liusslans are reported In strong
force about Cernavoda They are
reported hurriedly bringing up ar
tillery for a final smash.
Reports of sanguinary fighting
In this sector appeared to be borne
out by other report* to Petrograd
of hundreds of dead picked up in
terltory from which Mackenien's
forces have been hammered hack
There was still some doubt here
as to the sharp r lghting about Pre
deal Uoth sides clalmcd the ad
vantage The Ilerllti statement ad
mitted the Transylvania Rumanian
arnile* adopted a strong offensive,
hut that all attacks were repelled.
Petrograd advices said the Rutna
nlans have all but completed en
velopment of the Teutonic left
flank.
In the territory about Dornavat
ria. In the Carpathians. Russian
troops, according to Merlin, have
developed a powerful offensive.
The liprlln announcement attaches
much Importance to their claim
that terrific Vustrian counter at
tacks have chased the Slavs back
from heights they took by storm In
thrpp days of fighting, ending Fri
day. The menace a Russian vic
tor* wouH be to tlen Falkenhavn's
rear at this point has led to the be
lipf that Hip Teutonic armies will
make a desperate stand.
Oen, Rrusltoff's armies, llerlin
advices say. are subjected to a sc
rips of ferocious wave attacks north
of Baranovichi, where heavy fight
ing is going on for possession of
railway lines.

AN APPRECIATION
"Editor The Star: On behalf of the Woodrow Wilson
nonpartisan campaign committee for the state of Washington,
permit me. as secretary, to express our heartiest appreciation
of the valuable patriotic service rendered by The Star in the
recent campaign. In so doing, we also are deeply grateful to
the great number of progressives, independent voters and
members of organized labor, who rolled up such a magnifi
cent majority In the state of Washington.
"The influence of The Star is plainly attested by the fact
that here in King county, where It circulates most, Woodrow
Wilson received more than 11,000 majority, which, if carried
out proportionately in the rest of the state, would have given
him 40,000 lead.
"Surely, it is something to be thankful for that a paper
with such influence should diroct it only for the common good,
with strict impartiality, fairness and justice. Because it stand*
for human welfare. It deserves the splendid faith the people of
King county and the state of Washington have in it.
