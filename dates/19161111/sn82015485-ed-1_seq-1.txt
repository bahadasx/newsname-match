Worth Careful Thought
Do you read the label to know whether
your baking' powder is made from cream
of tartar or, on the other hand, from alum
or phosphate?
Royal Baking' Powder is made from
cream of tartar, derived from grapes, and
adds to jthe food only wholesome qualities.
Other baking powders contain alum or
phosphate, both of mineral origin, and .
used as substitutes for cream of tartar
, because of their cheapness.
Never sacrifice quality and healthful-
ness for low price.

At. 8:45' one evening recently 65
autos, by actual count, were standing
on the streets of Wa-Keeney, and
probably as many more had been in
town that afternoon. '
A mere reporter who rode in the
rear seat of the governor's car says
that there are ten thousand hills be
tween Stockton and Hoile and that
half of them are in Graham county.
And that answers the question, " Why
is Hill city?" .

Waiting and watching for Molly
threw me into a cruel fever of excite

worth it.

MARKET REPORT
' Kansas City Stock Yards, Novem
ber 1918. Shippers, laid, oft f or.
election,. cattle receipts dropping to
7500 head, but the buying side- kept
right at work, and killing cattle sold
mostly 10 to 15 higher. Best stockers
and, feeders are quoted steady this'
week.but the right kind sell stronger,
while middle and low grades are
weaJc and slow to move. Hogs got an
advance of 5 to 10 cents, sheeps
steady.
Beef Cattle Prime' heavy steers
brought $11 today, yearlings reach
$10.75 easily this week, and strictly
prime finished steers are worth $11.25.
Middle grades show more firmness
than any other kinds, steers selling
at $7.25 to $7.50 this week like the
$6.40 kind two or three , weeks ago.
Good cows bring $6.25 to $7.50, can
ners $4.15 to $4.75. Packers have a
big outlet for meats, and buy any
thing that carries a sign of flesh.
Last week was the heaviest week in
cattle slaughter this year, 44,920 head
killers in the plants here, as compar
ed with 23,536 head corresponding
week last year. Up to the first week
in November the cattle slaughter at
Kansas City for this Tear was 1,058.389
bead, against 796,561 head same per
iod last year.
Stockers and feeders.' The demand
continues to run toward light weight
cattle, yet all the best kinds are sell
ing at comparitively low prices, 85.75
to $6.75, with some clean up stockers
down to canner cow prices, with bred
stock steers sell at $6.90 to $7.50, with
a few yearlings above that, price,
feeders ranging from $6.50 to $7.80,
packers furnishing strong competi
tion on all steers with flesh.
Hogs Receipts were 7500, and the
market took on the advance of 5 to
I strong desire for hogs, top $9.75, bulk
$9.40 to $9.?0,. light weights up to
$9.60. Packers are handicapped by a
shortage of help in the plants, else
they would bid even more strongly
for hogs, because theyX are making
$5 a head on them, according to esti
mates based on live hog prices in
connection with board of trade figures
on pork products. Therefore, price
breaks are not expected to stick at
this time, bog sellers having every
thing favoring a higher market-
Sheep and Lambs Receipts were
3500 bead, market steady, best Iambs,
$11.00 and $11.05, short fed lambs
$10..'0 to $10.85, natives up to $11.00
for best. Fat ewes, sell at $7.00 to
$7.25, common ewes to killers at $5.50
this week. Stronger prices are ex
pected, as range offerings, are about
exhausted for this season, and fed
