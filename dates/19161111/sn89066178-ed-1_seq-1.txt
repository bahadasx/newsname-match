0 strong ia religious prtjudict
and to essentially is the spir
it of intolerance, a part of
the Roman Catholic parochial
t
c5V
training that where this schooling
obtains, the uniform record of Rome
as shown by history and ad fined by
all the popes is in evidence in acts
of criminal lawlessness, and exhibi
tions of contempt for the funda
mental puarantees .of our FEDER
AL CONSTITUTION.
From before the dsys of the Coun
cil of Constance when the great
German divine, John Hubs, was
burned to death in spito of the safe
conduct that had been given him,
down through the dark and bloody
days of the Reformation, through
the awful night of Spanish Inquisi
tion when Rome changed the
music of laughter and happiness
throughout Catholic Europe into the
shrieks of the tortured, the cries of
the dving, and the moans of be
reaved widows and daughters of the
papal victims, down past the mas
sacre of St Bartholomew fo ihi
jmsent hour: the record of Rome
r&enerer and whtrtrtr th possesrd
tk$ power is a consistent record of
trar lo ih death on freedom of re
ligious discussion, frttdom of sjteck,
press, and assembly.
At every step, Rome's unreason
ing religious prejudice and impla
cable intolerance has darkened his
tory in exact proportion at the has
had ihs pouer to slay tht march of
progress, freedom, and enlightened
civilisation.
Rome Never Changes
Nor has this supreme incarnation
of the anti-Christ changed with the
flight of centuries, a fact which the
last pope and the present infallible
head of the Roman hierarchy hare
made perfectly clear.
A short time before the death of
Pius X, the Spanish government
Easscd a law permitting the Proton
int or non-Catholic churches of
Spain to "poet notices of service
and bear the customary outward
signs of houses of worship." This
pitifully small concession to the
spirit of advancing civilization so
aroused the indignation of pope
Pius X that he made a vehement
protest, everr phrase of which ex
pressed RELIGIOUS PREJUDICE
of a most virulent type. "He." said
the Rev. William Sullivan, formerly
a professor in the Roman Catholic
House of Studies, "fairli tlartled
tht rorld bf the manner in which
ht stored his hostility to this law."
Yet that is but one, and by no
meana the roost striking exhibition
of the religious prejudice and in
tolerance of Pius X.
One year ago this month at the
birthday reception given him by the
Society for the Preservation of the
Faith, Tope Benedict XV denounced
the American divines and sriiolars
who represent the Baptist, Method
ic, Presbyterian, and Lutheran
churchee as thieves," "liars," anJ
"emiaaaries of SaUn," according to
the verbatim report of the utter
ances of the popi given in the Bos
ton Yet in its iaiue of December
tSth, 1915.
When we have the fountain head
of present day papacy, the present
pope and bis immediate predecessor
giving such vicious examples of re
ligious prejudice and intolerance, it
is not strange that faithful sons of
the rhurrh in America hold our lsws
in suh contempt that from week
to wnk they pjve us impressive
h-Mnns in that it would mean if
Roman Catholics khouM eucived in
tlifjjr campaign of making America
"dominantly Catholic."
Fifty Tears ago the Molly Ma
guires all of whom were members
of the Roman Catholic Ancient Or
der of Hilernian terrorized a por
tion of Pennsylvania with a verit
able camival of cold-blooded mur
der. This group or militant Ro
man Catholics, however, confined
their criminality to a comparative
ly small section of the lend.
In recent years the Knights of
Columbus have been apparently
competing for evil eminence with
this criminal band of earlier days
inasmuch as they have been playing
a most prominent part in the nation-wide
campaign of criminal law
lessness, mobocraey, murderous as
sault, and murder which has marked
the Roman Catholic aggressive war
being waged against freedom of
speech, press, and assembly. This
campaign of criminal lawlessness
which hss eitcnded from ocean to
ocean, and from the Lakes to the
Gulf has been supplemented by the
American Federation of Catholic
Societies' pernicious activity in pro
moting press censorship by boycott
and other well-known papal meth
ods. Indeed, if it had not been for
the success of this dastardly at
tempt to establish the Roman In
dex in the sanctum of the American
secular press the systematic cam
paign of monocracy and murderous
assault indulged in by Roman
Catholics in recent years would
never have been possible in our re
public. The Men-ace through its im
mense circulation has hnppily been
able to bring before millions of
Americans these jtersistent exhibi
tions of criminal lawlessness thai
are in evidence from week to week
and so great has been its inllujace
in this respect that in many of iho
more recent instances, notably the
Roman Catholic riots in Chicago,
Illinois and Haverhill, Massachu
setts, last spring the secular press
was practically forced to take cog
nizance of the outrages. It is our
duty and purpose from week to week
to furnish our readers- with these
histories of papal outrages against
law order and popular rights.
This week we have to report two
more typical examplea of Roman
Catholie contempt for law and or
der and opposition to our FEDER
AL CONSTITUTION'S guaran
tees. Democracy Vs. Romanism
In the city of Cleveland, Ohio,
on October 6th, Rome gave a start
ling example of the difference be
tween the result of our democratic
free school education and that of
Roman Catholic parochial school
training. On this evening arrange
ments had been made for a dehate
at the llaptift chunh on West 25th
street between Mrs. Slatterv and
Mis. Nelson, the latter a Roman
Catholic. According to the ar
rangement, Miss Nelson was to open
the debate. The audience seemed
to 1 very evenly divided between
loyal Americans and Romanists.
During Miss Nelson's address the
patriotic Americans in the audience
reflected the influence of our public
schools and liberal democratic con
stitution by giving the speaker their
respectful attention. On the other
hand, as soon as Mrs. Flattery com
menced to speak the children of
Rome bean to reflect the spirit of
the infallible head of their church
and the baleful result of Roman
Catholic parochial training by re
fusing to permit Mrs, Slattery to
reply to Miss Nelson. They created
sucli an uproar that not only was
the meeting broken up but police
were compelled to arrest five of the
leaders of the Roman riot The facts
of this outrage were cYcfully sup-
tressed by the daily press of Cleve
and, though no sane person ac
quainted with the eager desire on
the part of newspapers to report

ONLY SIOOOOGLOO NEEDED
Citizens Wilt Pay for Papal Sine
Pen Machinery in tht Namt
of Charity
I
T will be remembered how a
pagsn emperor of Rome once
decreed that the whole world
should be taxed. The pur
pose of that tax was to enrich the
(Vsara and magnify their power.
In like manner, papal Rome decree
that the whole world shall be taxed
to enrich the papal system and
maguify popery.
Pagan Rome collected its tax in
the name and by the authority of
Crsir: papal Rome collects its tax
in the name c." religious charity and
j authority of its pope. The
Canaan ruled and gathered taxes by
military force. The popes rule and
gather taxes by strategy, diplomacy,
and skillful manipulation of human
feeling.
The pope's tax-gatherers, unable
to force payment of contributions to
the enrichment of their master and
his world-wide corporation, grt the
samo result by clever play upon
human emotions. It is a noble
deed to share prosperity with the
distressed. It is more blessed to
give than to receive provided the
gift is to the needy; but there can
be no blessing on the gift that takes
from the generous to make the rich
richer.
The so-called Roman Catholic
church is the richest corporation on
earth. It is also the most persistent
and most successful beggar on esrth.
Its enormous wealth is the accumul
ation of busy begging for centuriea.
Conscientious people, grateful for
plenty, are disposed to charity and
division of their surplus with the
1cm fortunate. Rome takes advan
tage of that generous feeling as a
means of filling its coffers and ex
tending rts power.
Charitv and generosity are
prompted by nobility of soul. They
are the product of fine feeling anil
worthy of commendation. But
thoughtless and indiscriminate giv
ing often defeats its own object.
None deserve charity but those who
need it The rich beggar is neces
sarily a fraud; and those' who give
in such a way as to enrich the al
ready overrich, do harm instead of
good. They harm themselves; they
harm society; and they harm those
who really deserve their help.
Rome, in its greedy grasping for
the power that wealth gives, ha
commercialized charity, and banks
on the humane feeling of the gen
erous. "Give me your money" says
Rome, "and I will do rood with it"
And the many comply more gener
ously than wisely. Their often
hard-earned savings pass from their
control into that of Kome; and they
have no means of knowing how or
for what purpose it is used.
This is the season when Rome's
trained beggars are abroad in the
land. The harvest is past, the in
crease is garnered, and the citizen
who can ever be expected to have a
surplus has it now. Therefore,
Rome is busy.
Out at Portland, Oregon, Bishop
Christie is making the usual plea
for funds, with a proposed home
for orphan girls as the basis and
excuse. He, and his financial as
sistant, are asking for one hun
dred thousand dollars. They have
their committees and solicitors, and
announce their intention to collect
the hundred thousand or more by
Dec 1. Then, what?
Why, they are going to do some
thing for orphan girls nobody
knows what or who. The only defi
nite thing about this campaign is
that Bishop Christie is to get con
trol and Kome is to become the
owner of what money can be pried
loose from the people of Portland.
All else must depend npon the will
of the blessed bishop and his asso
ciate agents of the papal system.
In what way are these people
specially qualified to spend money
for the benefit of v orphan girls?
How are they Ukel to go about it?
Singe nobodj hi &cj accurate in
formation en tf. subject, what are
the probabilitUe?
We have sees how the rare for
fir Is ia their so-celled House of
the Good She pherd, and this alleged
"charitv" is likely to be another one
Just like the cthere. There will
Srobably be eome large buildings,
accreted with crowea, easy enough
to get into but d;!Acu!t to get out
of. These will be securely fenced
with a high wall or railing to keep
the eager public from breaking in
and disturbing the inmates.
One or more f these buildings
will 14 fitted up for laundries,
overall factorier, garment-making
hops, and the like; and, since this
is a "charitable" institution, the
land, buildings, and machinery will
I exempted from taxation, which
is a fine thing for anyone in the
laundry or garment-making busi
ness. Each of these buildings, and its
inmates, will be looked after by nun
teachers who have been induced to
work for nothing or to turn back
whatever stipend they may receive
into the Romish exchequer. Every
thing is now ready for the orphans,
and there are plenty of them to be
found even in peaceful America. If
the priests of adjacent parishes can
not find enough, the municipal
courta will help. If any of the
said orphans are so stiff-necked as
to rsbel against the "charity" of
fered, municipal judges of the right
kind may be counted npon to "com
mit" them to thie "good home
where they will receive such an edu
cation as becomes their station in
life and will so train them that they
will grow up religious and indus
trious." Of course the city is not going to
commit inmates to this beneficent
school without paying for their care
out of city fund. Therefore our
orphan home loses nothing by tak
ing in infants, and makes much by
accepting those who are advanced
enough to take several 7ears train
ing on the washboard.
See what a magnificent institu
tion Bishop Christie will now have
for the people of Portland to proud
ly point to. The plant is a gift from
the charitably im lined people. It
pays no taxes. It labor, from fore
women to comrmm lalor, costs noth
ing. How would you like to run a
laundry or garment factory under
such favorable Conditions? Which
is the more appropristc name for
this sort of thing charity, or graft?
And yet, this is the kind of an
institution that Portland people are
asked to build and give to the ecclesiastical-financial
agnfAjf Rome.
Have the people of Portland for
gotten the case of the young woman
who told last summer in a Portland
court how she had lost a hand' in
the mangle of an II. O. O. S. laun
dry? Arc you going to build this
thing for Rome so more girls can
be crippled for life and have their
hanls ground into profit for the
richest corporation on earth?
Are there not many better
way of bestowing your surplus?
Wouldn't it be better to give direct
ly to those you know are in need?
If the orphai girls are to be pro
vided for, wouldn't it be better for
the city of Portland to own its
asylum than to have it privately
owned and operated for profit?
Think it over, good people of Tort
land and good "people of all other
American cities.
When we feel moved to do some
thing for the poor and unfortunate,
h t's do it o the orphans will get the
benefit If the people of Portland
and other cities wish to pride them
selves on their charities, why not
build real charities and own them
as well as psy for them ?
If this suggestion is offensive to
those who imagine that it is an at
tack on rcligiyi, let the offended
ones remember that we are not talk
ing or writing about religion. This
is about charijy the commercial
i7ed charity which a pretended
church uses to wheedle funds from
the generous and to grind profit
out of orphan..
No really charitable person wishes
to be party to such a practice;
therefore the generous should have
a care to give wisely as well as lib
erally. Sec, first of all, who is to
be ths beneficisry. If it is your de
sire to help tke orphans, for the
orphan's sake, 'land for charity's
sake, and for God's take, help the
orphans. i

0 ssys the supposedly learned
Coude B. Pallen, editor of
the Catholic Kncyclopedia
and eminent juggler of lit
erature for renal purposes, as
quoted by the pope's Brooklvn
Tablet of Oct. 14. This may "be
regarded as the keynote of papist
preachment for the campaign al
ready under way to discredit Martin
Luther and the reformation.
October 31, 1017 will be the four
hundredth anniversary of that Hal
lowe'en when Luther posted his
ninety-five propositions on the ca
thedral door in Wittenberg. In
the meantime much will be heard
of this man whom Kome hates with
a fury well nih diabolical. Luther,
his work, and the tremendous ef
fect of that work, will be much in
the public mind during the couiug
year; and Koine is beginning early
to twist the thoughts of its ducs
concerning the hero who fought nnd
defeated the all-powerful papacy
with no other weapon than the
sword of the spirit and with no
armor but a righteous cause.
Pallen, tho papist, affects great
philosophical breadth when h says
thitf the fighting nations did not
begin tho great war but he Mrays
a conspicuous narrowness and big
otry when he declares that Luther
started the war with a scrap of
paper. Think, if you can, of a sixteenth-century
monk starting a
twentieth-century war by challeng
ing the theologians of his time to
debate. But such is papistic bom
bast. It it true that Luther did renew
the struggle of the ages when he
published his theses; but he didn't
start a war either then or now. lie
gave a new and most potent expres
sion to the human hunger for free
dom and tlii rat for reality. Tojicry
had becomo a farce through cen
turies of papal corruption that
transformed the city of Rome and
the palace' of the popes into a
brothel beneath the contempt of
barbarians.
Far away in the Thuringian for
ests and the Ilartz mountains, wide
ly removed from the artificialties
of Kome. a mighty race was strug
gling with nature to overcome dif
ficulties and thereby acquire those
genuine virtues which have made
the Savon a virile individual and a
determining force in civilization.
From that race sprang Martin
Luther, the son and the grandson
of peasants. In due time the farce
of his personality enade Rome trem
ble: for he was the champion of the
real, the true, and the good in its
age-long struggle with privilege and
pretense.
If we are to go back of this war
to discover its beginning, we must
go further than the sixteenth cen
tury, rapist writers would have us
believe that there was no war prior
to that time, but those who nave
delved into history know how the
world had been unified .time and
time again under such warriors and
universal rulers as Alexander of
Oreece end' Augustus of pagan
Rome. There was nothing new or
unique about this unity that rested
on papal power. It was another
subjection of the world to a despot
who made a little more than cus
tomary claim to divine sanction.
There is, indeed, a greater war of
which the present war may be re
garded as a phase or incident That
irar began with tha rie of autocracy.
It began when one roan assumed the
right, on one apecious claim or an
other, to rule and eiploit other mm.
It began with tyrants fighting on
one aids to maintain their claims
to privilege, and with the mas
fighting cn the other side for a
greater degree ef freedom.
Such is the big war, of which all
other wars, and the interims which
wt call peace, are tho component
parts. That war ia fought every
where and continuously where man
comes in contact with 'his kind. It
victories are won in pea.-e lcili
lion as well a in warlike combat.
It goes on in field and fn. lory, in
fhop and store, a well in trrmh
and turret It is the fiht for free
dom which can never ccaso until
permanent freedom is won for all
people.
Such was the war which Martin
Luther renewed, but did not atari,
when he challenged the learned
doctors to debate. To bo sure he
disturbed the unity which was so
sgreeable to Rome. There was a
similar disturbance of unity when
Jonah parted from the great fish
that had swallowed him. Luther
refused to swallow Romish dogma
with his eyes shut or to be swal
lowed by the Csh stories and fal
lacious claims of sacerdotal sophis
try. lie rebelled just as any decent
self-respecting man must rebel
against what is manifestly evil and
untrue. In so doing he challenged
a tyrant and won the support of
freedom's friends. ITe upset papal
unity just as Europe afterwards up
set the unity Bouaparte was trying
to fasten upon it.
Unity is desirable only when es
tablished on a practicable basis;
and one-man rulerahip can never be
that basis. The race is seeking
unity such as recognizes the indi
vidual and his right to life anil lib
erty. Luther was the champion of
that unity which does not unify the
world by subjection to emperors or
popes, but by union of man with
man for a common purpose and the
common goott.
Luther was a religionist, but his
religion was so true and so vital that
it bore political as well as religious
fruit. His repudiation of papal
authority contributed directly and
immensely to the rise of democracy,
and indirectly to the fraternalism
and unionism that today make for
the coming unity.
Fallen's figure, of a pyramid
standing upon its apex, fits nothing
so well as the Romish regime in
Luther's time. Rome would now
restore its inverted pyramid with
its pope at the apex and the human
race very much up in the air. But
democracy, as an outgrowth of
Luther's pioneer efforts has already
restored the social pyramid to its
proper position with the people as
its basis and its apex occupied by
public servants who administer af
fairs not according to their own
whim and caprice but according to
laws enacted by common consent.
To be sure, the social, political, and
economic pyramid is not yet per
fect: but it is right side up which
is of fundamental importance.
How silly to every sane mind
must be this bombastic declaration
that the present war is Europe's
punishment for the Reformation,
tho so-called apostacy. Such a con
ception is possible only to a mind
narrowed by K)rinjr over the medi
;rval moonshine of Thomas Aquina.
This war is but the continuation of
the world-long struggle that must
go on in some form until true
greatness is dominant and proves
its greatness by social service.
The first step toward Christian
unity was the repudiation of papal
unity which Luther accomplished.
The next step was repudiation of
all pretenders to rulership by di
vine right, which was realized polit
ically by the American colonics.
There are many steps yet to be
taken before the goal of Christian
unity becomes an accomplished
fact; but it was exemplified twenty
centuries ago when the First Chris
tian gave his blood and bodv for the
salvation of the world, an J washed
his disciples feet with the admoni
tion that all should serve, each
one the other, as he hsd served them.
Christian unity is to come with
universal service instead of uni
versal rulership. Get that point
clear, for upon that fact hangs the
law of life and the realization of
the Gospel. Papal unity offers it
self with the barbaric trappings of
(Continued oa Fage t, CoL 3).

This Attempt to Mode Papers

Si
XF. of the brightest and mot
reailahle of Masonic
paper
published in the
United
States i Liiht of Ixuivil!e.
Ky. In its October number. Light
tell intt restini;!)' of how Rome
tried and failed to put the lid on the
Masonic press.
This effort to control Mason ia
publications wa a natural outcome
of the wider sAeme to destroy such
outspoken opponents of political
Romanism as The Mem ace, and to
create a censorship by law that
could be used aa a means of keeping
all criticism of pop"? ou' f print.
The Masonic journals were al
most a unit in opposing this com
prehensive scheme for the establish
ment of a censorship. Their editora
saw clearly, and at once, the true
nature and meaning of the effort.
They also realized its antagonism
to the principles of their order as
well as to tho constitution of the
United States and to the spirit o
Americanism.
Some of them were fcarlcse
enough to connect the scheme with
its clerical authors and their foun
tain of inspiration. There was sS
new Richmond in the field to defend
the free press which Rome had as
sailed. Something had to be done.
The lying agents of popery could
not hope to smear mud on the Ma
sonic press as they had on other
publications, so they resorted to tac
tics suitable to the situation.
The Knights of Columbus, created
to "Make America Catholic," ia
turn created a committee to execute
its designs. To fool tho public and
to promoto its own hypocritical pre
tentions, this was styled a "com
mittee on religious prejudice." Thia
committee came into existence with
a flourish, and endowed with fifty
thousand dollars.
Much advertising was obtained
in the usual way, and the public in
formed thereby that this committee)
would proceed to discover the source)
of the "religious prejudice" so an
noying to papists, and would em
ploy suitable means to allay the said
prejudice.
It so happened that the chair
man of thii committee, one CoL
Callahan, was a resident of Louis
ville. Ky., in which city the Masonio
Home Juurnnl is published. CoL
Callahan invited the editors of the
Journal to confer with him in re
gard to the liest means of allaying
prejudice and living happy ever
after. The invitation was accepted;
and one of these editors. v?ho is now;
the editor of Light, says:
