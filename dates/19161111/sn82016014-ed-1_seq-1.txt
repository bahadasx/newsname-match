The chill wind from the northeast
cut across Washburn field this after

ter to witness the annual clash be
tween the Ichabods and Jayhawkers.
Gray clouds hung low, threatening

The field was spongy and the rain ,
early in the week was not heavy j
enough to slow up the speed of the
teams.
Coach Clark of the invaders an-.
nounced an entire second string lineup

team, sending Captain Stewart to the :

No Danger Now if You Didn't
Pay Your Bill.
- HEARING IS SET FOR MONDAY
Fight Out the Attempts to Re
duce Topeka's Rate.
Enjoined, Too, for Jfot Enforc
ing 3-Cent Penalty.
Tour gas meter will not be cut off
by the gas company before 9 o'clock
Monday morning, even If you didn't
pay your bill before 5 o'clock last
night.
Attorneys Harvey & Addington, rep
resenting the Topeka Industrial coun
cil, filed an injunction suit in the dis
trict court just before noon today and
while no temporary injunction was
granted, T. F. Doran, attorney for the
gas company, called up L. G. Tre
leaven, receiver, and instructed him
not to shut off any of the meters be
fore the application for an injuctlon
had been heard. And the hour set for
the hearing is 9 o'clock Monday morn
ing. The plaintiffs in the case are F. B.
Brown, J. o. Stevic. P. M. Montgom
ery, George Hughes, F. W. Felton, J.
W. DeGroff, W. H. Kerle, Frank Cur
ry, V. R. Parkhurst, and others.
The defendant is the Consumers'
Heat, Light & Power company.
The petition tells briefly the history
of the gas litigation. It stated that
December 10 the public utilities com
mission heard an application for an
increase in gas prices and fixed a rate
of 28 cents per thousand feet.
It states that the United States dis
trict court then enjoined the 28 cent
rate until a hearing had been held in
the federal court; that the case was
heard and the rate fixed at 32 cents
per thousand feet.
Then, the petition says, the defend
ant company, prior to November 1,
1916. announced that the rate would
be 50 cents per thousand for the first
three thousand feet and 35 cent for
succeeding thousands, with an added
3 cents 'f the consumer fail to pay his
bill by the tenth of each month.
, Prayer of the Petitioners.
The petition asks that the court en
join the gas company from charging
50 cents per thousand for the first
three thousand feet and 3 5 cents per
thousand for succeeding thousands.
It asks that the company be en
joined from adding a 33 cent per
thousand penalty for failure to pay
before the tenth of the month.
It asks that the company be en
Joined from cutting qff gas service for
failure to pay the new gas rate.
-And finally it asks that the costs in
the case be taxed up against the gas
company.
The case will be heard by both of
the judges of the district court Mon
day. Judge A. W. Dana and Judge G.
H. Whltcomb will sit in one of the
court rooms and listen to the argu
ments. It is expected that there will
be considerable legal talent gathered
when the .case comes up Monday
morning.
The attorneys for the plaintiffs had
a motion for a temporary restraining
order along with the petition today
but it remains unsigned. There is no
temporary restraining order to date.
The Judges could not hear the case
today and Attorney Doran simply in
structed his client to make no move
until the case had been heard.

He Refuses to Apologize for
Uncomplimentary Remarks.
OTHER DECISIONS DOWN TODAY
Melinda Nichols Lawful Wife
of George Haywood.
Parole Law Well Defined to
Care for Cases Here.
John F. Hanson, well known in
sanity lawyer, was today suspended
from practice in all state courts, un
der an order from the supreme court.
The action followed the refusal or neg
lect of .Hanson to apologize for un
complimentary remarks which Hanson
recently made concerning the supreme
court in a petition filed with the tri
bunal. Until the court makes some
further order, Hanson is barred from
practice in all state courts.
For several years Hanson has been
a thorn in the flesh of the Kansas su
preme court. Usually when a lawyer
loses a case before the court and is
denied an application, he goes home
and tries to forget. Sometimes he
closes the door of his office and 'ex
presses himself in quite positive terms.
But it usually stops there. Hanson,
refused to subside. He was persistent
in the extreme and when he was flat
ly and emphatically denied, he filed a
document with the court which was
the last word in contempt and disre
spect. Some months ago the court ordered
Hanson to appear and adjust accounts.
It was an offering for him to escape
punishment thru an apology. But
Hanson didn't come to Topeka. Nor
did he send his apology. So now the
court has wiped his name from the
list of lawyers eligible to practice in
the courts.
Two years ago Hanson was a can
didate before the primaries on the
non-partisan Judicial ballot and
sought nomination as an associate jus
tice of the supreme court. He polled
more than 18,000 votes and lost the
nomination by the narrowest sort of
margin. In August this year, he was
nominated for district judgeby "the"
voters in the Reno-Harvey-McPherson
district. Whether he would be per
mited to serve in event of an election,
is a matter of considerable dispute.
Hanson has brought many cases be
fore the state courts. He field numer
ous actions to secure the release of
Insane patients from state hospitals
and at one time was tried for his own
sanity, but acquitted. At one time he
filed suit for damages against mem
bers of the state board of control and
justices of the supreme court. He
failed to maintain his action and later
annuonced that he himself would
enter the race for a place on the su
preme bench. In this endeavor, he al
most won the nomination.
Defines Parole Law.
Paroles shall be granted at the dis
cretion of the state board of correc
tiones and are not compulsory follow
ing expiration of a prisoner's mini
mum sentence, according to a decision
today by the state supreme court. The
decision was in the case of Fred Gar
vey, convicted of assault with intent to
kill.
Garvey was sentenced to a term of
one to ten years. At expiration of the
first year of his sentence, Garvey was
eligible to parole. He was not re
leased by the board, however, and
filed suit to compel the board to act.
Both the Leavenworth county district
court and the. supreme court held that
while Garvey might be eligible to re
lease, it was not compulsory and was
a matter entirely within the discretion
and Judgment of the state board.
Must Label Goods.
The supreme court upheld the 'con
tention of the state board? of health
when it reversed the Shawnee county
district court and set aside an injunc
tion against the state board of health
which sought to force the Corn Prod
ucts Refining company to place labels
on its syrups. The company disputed
the theory of the state health board.
When the state department threatened
action, the syrup company secured an
injuction against the , board's order.
The supreme court, however, held that
the board could regulate the branding
and sale of foodstuffs.
Davis Loses a Case.
The supreme court today issued a
writ of mandamus compelling W. K.
Davis, state auditro, to register bonds
for the erection of a high school at
Rantoul, Franklin county. Davis had
refused to register bonds because the
transcript did no tdefinitely locate the
proposed new building. The school
district then brought suit to compel
registration of the bonds and the court
today directed .the state auditor to ac
cept the issue.
Melinda Nichols Wins.
The supreme court today held that
Melinda Nichols was the lawful wife
of George Haywood and entitled to

arrival of the troops is not avaUable,
but they will be in Topeka some time
during the forenoon. The Horton,
Holton and Oskaloosa organizations
will change here for their various des
tinations. Mayor Jay House issued a proc
lamation late this afternoon request
ing the business houses and citizens

every way, Mayor House said.
WADOO MAY RESIGN
Changes In Cabinet Probable After
Inauguration or Wilson.
Washington,. Nov. 11. Now that
Mr. Wilson has been re-elected, the
politicians are beginning to construct
a new cabinet for the president. There
seems to be a general opinion that
several of the resignations that will
be formally tendered after March 4,
will be accepted. Among those who i
rumor says may retire are Secretaries j
McAdoo. Daniels, Redfield, Baker, j
Postmaster General Burleson and At- i
torney General Gregory. !
It is said McAdoo feels he is not '
doing justice to his family financially j
by remaining in uie cabinet.
WILSON BROKE RECORD
Largest Popular Vote Ever Accorded
Presidential Candidate.
Washington. Nov. 11. Secretary
Tumulty today sent the following tele
gram to President Wilson at Williams
town, Mass.:
"More complete returns show that
you have received the largest vote
ever cast for a candidate for the pres
idency. You have received nearly a
million more votes than were cast for
both Taft and Roosevelt in 1912. Your
gain over 1912 is three times as much
as was ever gained by a president run
ning for re-election."

Two Columns Move North
From Chihuahua City.
Northern Capital Now Fortified
by Heavy Artillery.
Chihuahua City, Nov. ll. The di
vision of troops under General Murr
gia, it is officially announced here, has
begun to advance northward from
Escalon in two columns. One column
is said to be proceeding up the line
of the Mexican Central railway, re
pairing the track, while the other con
sisting of 3.000 cavalrymen is paral
leling the track on a hunt for bandits.
Military authorities here state that
Villa is near the Darango border so
that this movement will cut him off
on the north or in the event of his
escape northward, place him between
the forces of Murgia and the cavalry
that General Trevino would dispatch
from Chihuahua.
The temporary fortifications encir
cling Chihuahua City nine miles in
circumference are being enlarged and
strengthened. A double row of barbed
wire entanglements has been con
structed outside the infantry trenches
while within, three strong earthen re
doubts are being built. These re
doubts hold 300 men each and are
provided with artillery. Sabta Rosa,
the hill dominating the approach to
the city,- is fortified and armed with
seven large calibre guns.
Gen. Gonzales Cuellar, a classmate
of General Trevino at the Chapultepec
Military academy and in charge of the
fortifications, commands 3,000 men,
mostly veterans of the siege of Ebano,
which held out seventy-two days
against a force double its size led by
Villa. General Trevino states that he
has plenty of ammunition for present
uses, including shells for the artillery
which is commanded by Colonel
Sanchez. His cavalry force of 4,000
men is equipped with machine guns
and he is here ready to take the field
at the first warning.
MOOSE VOTE DID IT
British Newspaper Sees Chance for
Wilson to Win Diplomatic Fame.
London, Nov. 11. The Manchester
Guardian attributes President Wilson's
success to the rallying; of a sufficient
number of Progressives' votes which
Roosevelt grained in 1912.
"It seems a small thing:," this news
paper continues, "but yet it may indi
cate a new epoch in American political
life. The Progressive movement arose
entirely independent of foreign poli
tics, many Progressive votes given to
"Wilson are given with the mental
reservation that they will not go again
to a Democratic president unless Wil
son confirms the faith of the Progres
sives by consolidating what is stjll
only tentative. If he does that he will
have established himself as the ablest
statesman since Lincoln and he may
be destined to play a part in the
achievement of peace which will give
him a place in world's history."
Peace Victory, Says Germany.
Amsterdam, Nov. 11. Great sur
prise is expressed in German newspa
pers received here over the re-election
of President Wilson. Where there
was doubt expressed in previous edi
tions that the president again iiad been
chosen, &.11 now accept his re-election
as a matter of fact.
The Cologne Gazette editorially said:
"The only fundamental- desire of the
American people is peace. They pro
cured a victory. With Wilson remain
ing our relations with America will
continue unchanged."
The Cologne Volks Zeitung said:
"President's re-election strengthens
our confidence that the United States

Dr. Eva Harding of Topeka, as a

him to recover," said Dr. Marcotte.
Metzger Is believed to have attempt
ed suicide because the parole upon
which he was released from the peni
tentiary provided that he should stay
away from Topeka.
Three or four year ago Metzger was
tried in the district court of Shawnoe
county on the charge of attempting
to kill his wife. It was charged that
he beat her in the head with a ham
mer and left her for dead. He was
convicted and sentenced to the peni
tentiary for a term of from five to
twenty-one years
Last s-pring Metzger was paroled
from the penitentiary and had his lib
erty for about two months. He mixed
up in several affairs which required
the presence of the police and his
parole was revoked. His application
for a parole again went before the
parole board and he was again given
his liberty last Monday. It was pro
vided that he should remain away
from Topeka. I
Had a Ticket to California.
It is stated that his relatives had
purchased, a ticket to California for
him, but that he declined to use it.
He has been morose since Monday.
This morning he picked up a rifle and
said he was going out in a field and
hunt some rabbits. He had been gone
only a few minutes when a rifle shot
was heard near the house. An in
vestigation was made and Metzger was
found in an outbuilding with a bullet
hole in his right temple. He was still
conscious when found.
He had pushed the rifle
through a set of bed springs; tied a
string to the trigger and pulled it. Dr.
O. R. Preston of Meriden was called
at once and Dr. O. F. Marcotte of To- '
peka, coroner, was there a short time1
laier. iney were unable to do any
thing for him. He lapsed into unnn-
! Bciuusness ana nis death Is expected
! at any time.

New York, Nov. 11. Charles Evans
Hughes will let his telegram of con
gratulations to Woodrow Wilson await
the official count of the votes in Cali
fornia, New Mexico, North Dakota.
New Hampshire and possibly one or
two other states.
If the official count confirms the
Wilson victory apparent now, it Is the
Republican nominee's wish and he is
the one. who, being mainly concerned,
has the final say that there be no
contest or court proceedings.
The reason the Republicans still are
unwilling to concede defeat Is that in
the five states whose vote Is still in
complete a change of 8,000 votes might
mean a shift In the tide of victory
from Wilson to Hughes. Errors in
volving several thousand votes fre
quently are discovered In recounts.
The Republicans hold they very easily
may have been made In :he excitement
of tabulating results of one of the
closest elections in American political
history.
Minnesota Soldier Vote Not In Yet.
In round figures, unofficial returns
show Wilson's lead In California about
3,300; in New Mexico about 2,300; In
North Dakota about 1,600; In Minne
sota Hughes leads by about 600 (with
the soldier vote still to be counted),
while in New Hampshire there is leas
than 100 margin for Wilson. The
electoral vote of these states where
the margin is less than 8,000 votes
totals 37.
Hughes now has 243 votes in the
electoral college about which there is
little doubt. The Republicans figure
Minnesota will also be his, bringing his
total to 255. That is eleven less than
the 266 majority required in the elec
toral college. If a recount should
show New Hampshire Republican,
bringing the Republican total to 239
and Hughes should gain several of
California's electoral votes on a split
of electors possible under the state
laws, he would arrive at the place
where North Dakota's five votes, or
New Mexico's three, recounted and
found Republican, might put him over,
instead of Wilson.
Holding n. O. P. "Wake."
The endless conferences of Republi

There were a few recriminations as
what the victorious Democrats face

ters, but for the most part the lead
ers were planning reorganization of
the party and beginning already to
look forward to 1920. One thing that
gave cause for Joy was that the Demo
cratic majority in the house of repre
sentatives had been swept away Wil
son on longer has complete domination
