JAPAN ALLEGES
Pl&I TO DEFRAUD
Official of' Imperial Qovernn&nt Un

CustOins OBtissa Inquiry Extends t».
.^ttsbwrgh,-Njav. il.—A plot to de
f*a^''4^iapipeke government out of
va«t sums df duties, on shipments to
that country has been uncovered in the
United States, according, to Oyama,
secretary of the department of agri
culture and commerce of the imperial
Japanese government, who is now in
Pittsburgh.
It was but recently that the scheme
was discovered and Mr. Oyama hur
ried to this country to make an inves
tigation. He had found enough evi
dence here, he declared, to warrant
further inquiry and the matter may
be laid before United States officials.
It is said goods from this country,
particularly from industrial centers,
have been greatly undervalued and he
is convinced some high officials in
Japan are implicated in the plot, as
well as American^.
Secretary Oyama left here today for
New York, where he will hold a con
ference with the collector of that port.
He expects to go to Canada, where
there are said to be ramifications of
the alleged plot.

Knlpp's court voluntarily a day later
and pleaded guilty. Knlpp fined them
$15 whereas a fine of $50 had been im
posed by Justice Knapp the day before
on Knlpp's friend. A question then
arose as to whether or not Knlpp had

and sentence was withheld in Knlpp's
case before Justice Knapp.

while printing the news of the Ameri
can election in prominent position, ex
piits little opinion aa to the result.
What comment there la la sympathetic
to President -WUaon. The Petit Journal
says: 'THealdent Wilson's victory is
highly satisfactory to us for two
rsasons: The first la that for four
years the American foreign policy will
ho tree from all electoral considera
tions/ aa the constitution forbids WU
aon from seeking a third term the
second is that the result is that the
election must put now life into Ameri

Must Heed Hughee' Veto
TBvldently an Immense majority of
the electorate pronounced against w»r,
but apart from the mlUlona of voters
who approved the vigor with which
the president forced the Germans to
recede on the submarine question,
others voted for Hughes ^because he
stood for an ovsn firmer defense of
American right. TSso ehSe* executive
bound to take Into account this
double wish. Just am Hughes could
not have Ignored the verdict against
war, so must Wilson -take into con

had characterized as "bacfcboneless.'"
The Matin and this Parisian ex
press the same Tiew. The latter paper
concludes:
"It la believed he played a very
honorable role in a moment of a great,
graTO crisis and thaA the American
people haTe renewed their mandate to
President Wilson. In 1912 he owed
hie election to the division of his ad
versaries. This time he owes it to his
prestige, to his campaign' and to the
confidence which he deserved. It is
possible that his poMcy will become
firmer and clearer that profiting by
experience toe will aaplre to play
larger role and appear aa champion ol

Saye Progressives Ehd It.
1-ondon. Nov. 11.—Ths Manchester
Guardian attributes President Wil£n's
success to the rallying of a sufficient
number ot the progressives 'which
"Roosevelt gained in 1^12.
It seems a small thing,'' the paper
says. 'but yot I* may indicate a new
epoch in American political life. The
progreiwlive movement arose ntlrely
Independent-of foreign politics^- Many
progressive'votes were given Wilson
with ths mental reservation that they
will iot go again to a democratic can
didate unless Wilson confirms the
faith of Che progressives by consoli
dating what is stHl only tentative. If
he does that hs will have established
himself as the ablest atatesmon since
Lincoln and he may be destined to
play a part In tlie achievement of
peace which will ghre Mm a place in
world history."

FOUR BIQ GAMES IN EA8T.
Contests on Gridiron to be Dseisivs in

New York, Nov. 11.—Of the clashes
on college gridirons In the east today
four command unusual Interest the
meeting of Princeton and Harvard at
Cambridge, of Yale and Brown at New
Haven, Cornell and Michigan at Ithaca,
and Pennsylvania and Dartmouth at
Philadelphia.
The Harvard Princeton game Is
likely to have an Important bearing on
the determination of eaatern college
honors. The mettle of these teams has
not been determined so far.
The meeting betwen Michigan and
Cornell is the only intersectlonal game
on today's list. The Ann Arbor team
is coming to demonstrate wiat their
last victory over Syracuse was not
gained by a fluke and that its team
ranks with the best eastern elevens.
Yale meets an undefeated team In
Brown and the game should guage the
real merit of the blue eleven.
In Dartmouth Pennsylvania will
meet no mean opponent. The army
and navy teams have comparatively
easy games. The former meets Maine
and the latter the North Carolina
Aggies.
