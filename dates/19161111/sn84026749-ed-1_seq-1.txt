LONDON, Nov. 11. The great
battle between Russo-Roumnnian
forces and Mackcnsen's troops in
the Dobrudja for possession of the
bridge across the Danube at Ccrna
voda continues. Advices from Bu
charest, Petrograd, and Berlin em
phasize this as the most important
operation of the day on any front.
Occupation of the Dunarcav sta
tion two miles west of Ccrnavoda
npp'ears to have given the Czar's
armies at least a temporary ad
vantage in their efforts to envelop
General Mackcnsen's left flank,
resting on the Danube. Military
experts here say a Slav success at
this point would place the Teutons
at great disadvantage in Dobrudja.

on for possession of railroad lines which

INTRODUCING JEAiNNETTE
Pet name of the jubilant suffragists
for the Montana dynamo of energy
who is to be the
FIRST CONGRESSWOMAN
By J. R. HILDEBRAND.
"Jeannette is- the best stump speaker in Montana, can
dance like a boarding school girl, and, believe, me, she will lead
those Congressmen a merry little two-step when she comes to
Washington."
Thus spoke one prominent suffrage leader when she heard
today that Miss Jeannette Rankin, of Missoula, Mont., had cap
tured the Montana election to the Ho.use of Representatives.
"They're mighty proud of her out there," said Paul Bar
den, of the State Department, who lives in Missoula. "I have
heard her speak, and she is one of the most fluent talkers I ever
listened to.
"She speaks anywhere and as often as she gets the chance.
During that campaign one could run across a crowd almost any
time listening to her talk. She made addresses to groups on
the streets, at country stores, at railway station platforms and
everywhere else she got the chance."
Suffragists Glad.
Suffragists in Washington are elated
over her coming to Congress, not only
because the election of n woman to
tho House means a victory for suffrage,
but because it wag Miss Ilankln who
won It.
To every suffragist she Is known af
fectionately as Jeannette. and "How Is
Jeannette running." has been the ques
tion on sufTraBlst lips around Waah
InBton since Tuesday,
"She Is a good fellow, a corking good
fellow. Just a normal American girl,
who sat besides her brothers at college
and studied the same sociology nnd the
same economics, and therefore her
psychology Is pretty much tho same."

Mackayo, who worked with her In
Washington In 1913-14, described her.

UNION HILL. N. J., Nov. ll.-Three
armed bandits robbed the office of
the Prudential Lire Insurance Com

and knocked unconscious Miss Emma

In charge at the time. v
Fifteen minutes before tha lmld-nn

The three robbers entered the place
as prospective customers. Whlle one
talked with Miss Jegger about a policy

railing with drawn revolvers.
"Open the safe," they cried at Miss
Jegger.
Instead of obeying the girl ran for

UNCERTAI
MTV
Hundreds of Capitol Employes
Breathlessly Awaiting Re
sult of Official Counts.
AN EVEN BREAK SO FAR
Present Indications Are That
F6ur Independent Votes Will
Hold Control.
With Republicans, and Democrats
both claiming the House bv a narrow
vote, hundreds of House employes
who hold office by the grace of tho
Democratic regime are on the anxious
seat.
Control of the House means much
to a lorge armv of Democratic office
holders and to a large army of Re
publicans who would like to be In
office.
For the Ins nnd the outs, therefore,
the close contest over the House has
a painful Intensity of Interest.
It will apparently take official
counts In several districts to decldo
the result definitely.
Four May Hold Balance.
Four members, neither Republlcas nor
Democrats, may hold the balance of
power In the House which will como Into
existence next March 4.
They are: '
Meyer London, of New York, Socialist.
Thomas D. Schall, of Minnesota, Pro
gressive. W. P. Martin, of Ioultana, Progres
sive protectionist.
A. F. Fuller, of Massachusetts, Inde
pendent. So close Is the division of the Hoti'c
between Republicans and Democrats
that the two are about evenly divide I.
Though both sides profess to have won.
the official count In close dlstilcts ui
have to be awaited.
Neither in Majority.
It l.i entirely possible that ne ther Re
publicans nor Democrats will lime n
majority The election of Speaker, (he
decision of contests, and practically .ill
Important "matter, save where a twn
thlrds' vote Is Tefiuln-d. arc settled by
a majority of those present.
It may be necessary for each side (o
pay court to r. Iindon. Mr. Hchnll,
Mr. Martin, and Mr. Fuller who nit comes
either to cliolce of a Speaker or other
matters of moment.
That London, who Is a Socialist, wilt
line up with the Demorrats Is expected.
But what the other three will do l
doubtful, and they are quite as likely io
align with the ..epubllcans.
Mr. Schall Is the blind member of the
House, hut is known as a man of
ablllt .
Woods Hopeful.
Chairman Frank Woods, of the Re
publican Congressional committee. Is
hopeful that the Republicans will
control by a narrow margin.
The best unofficial figures at pres
ent show that the Democrats have L'lB
members and the Republicans 215.
with the Kw Mexico result undecided
nnd with the balance of power In the
hands of four who do not belong to
either party.
The Democrats have not given up
hope of re-electing Thomas J. Scully
In the Third New Jersey district,
where Robert Carson, Republican,
was chonse by a close vote on the
face of the returns. The Democrats
will soek to seat Scully by an of
ficial count.
Two close Pennsylvania districts,
the Twenty-first and Thirty-second,
add to the uncertainty of Jthe situation-
, .
Soldiers to Decide.
The Thirty-second is the one rep
resented by Barchfcld. In the Twen-ty-nrst,
there Is a close race between
W. K. Tobias. Democrat, nnd C. H.
Rowland, Republican. Rowland Is
ahead, but the soldiers' vote will
probably decide It. ..... ,,
The Brltt district In North Carolina
Is close and his opponents will try to
beat him on a recount. ......
The situation Is no close that It Is
likely to be some days before It can
be ald positively which party will
control the House. .... . .
A number of contests to be brought
before the next House will add to the
complications.

Tempest Stirred Up.
Meantime a veritable political tem
pest has been stirred up In California
Republican circles by the loss of the '
State to the Democrats. .
Chairman Rowcll, in a statement pub
lished today, declared that Hughes was
defeated because hchad falltvd to con-,
vlnce. a large minority of the Progres
sives that he was the man who should j
lead them
"lnrdent of the trip of Hughes to
California." he said, "when he was pre
vented from recognizing Gov. Hiram
Johnson or of being rccognlred by Pro
gressive lenders, was the climax of the
situation here. '
Row ell added that Hughes hlmseir
wis persounlly blumeless In this con
nection, saying those who managed his
trip here were responsible.
"The Progressive leaders faithfully
supported Hushes." he said, "and suc
ceeded In Inducing the majority of the
Progressives to follow them, but the
minority niill to the lalior vole and
the pacifist woman's vote, turned the
tide for yilson."

President Has Not Indicated
H s Intentions, But Some
Shifts Are Suggested.
Coiiginlulntoi) telegrams nnd letters
Lfroni nil parts of the United States
I Hooded the White House today. At J
the rate at which thev arc now being
'received. Presldcntr Wilson, on his re
tutu to WasTilhi
1gton tomorrow night,
baskets of congratula-
will find several
tlons aualtlnir him.
None, however, has thus far been re-
.reived from Charles Evans Hughes, the
d created Kepuullcan -candidate.
Seeictary Tumulty, who returned
to Washington Innt night, was at his
desk at the executive offices at an
early hour. Although Jubilant over
the outcome, he showed plainly the
effects of the strain. He has lost
weight to A noticeable extent. He Is
one of the few Democratic leaders,
who, In face of the apparently cer
tain returns last riicsuav nignt in
dicating the election of .Mr. Hughes,
refused to concede It.
Refused to Believe Defeat.
For thirty-odd hours he hung over
ihi! telegraph wlie nt Asbury Park
during Tuesday night and Wednesday,
and did not retire until his confidence
was vindicated. And during all that
time the Preslent did not Inquire as
to the leturns more than twlc,c.
With the result of the b.illutlng now
largct a mutter pf the past. Interest
naturally turns to what If nnv changes
the President will make In his Cabi
net, and to the approaching session of
Congress. While the coming session
will find the Democrats with their pres
ent mujnritles In both branches, it is
anticipated that efforts will be made by
the 1'iesldenl to put through ns much
legislation uu possible befoie the new
Congress conies Into being.
Changes Arc Discussed.
While there Is nothing whatever at
piesent to Justify a prediction that
the President will change the make
up of tils Cabinet. It' Is pointed out In
political circles that changes would
not be unusual at the beginning of
the second terms of an Administra
tion, und also that whatever nolltleal
obligations may have dictated the
composition of the original Cabinet
are no lunger Dinaing.
In other words. It is suggested, from
a purely political standpoint, the re
sults of Tuesday's election would en
title the West, which elected the
President, to far more consideration
than, for example. Now York, which,
though it now has three Cabinet offi
cers Secretaries Lansing, McAdoo,
nnd Redfleld went overwhelmingly
for Hughes.
Supported Wilson.
The number of Texans two In tho
piesent Cabinet may be attributed In
part to the consistent and loyal support
of the Texas delegation for Mr. Wilson
In the Baltimore convention In 1912. Po
litically speaking. It Is pointed out. the
President could now with perfect fair
ness consider these obligations as hav
ing been paid off, and give one or two
of tho posts now held by Texans to ono
or two prominent Democrats of the
Northwest. 1
Attorney General Gregory, who Is
from Texas, has been roported on sev

"More comptete returns show you

NEW YORK, Nov. 11. Charles
Evans Hughes will let his telegram

the votes in California, New Mex
ico, North Dakota, New Hampshire,

If the official count confirms the

the Republican nominee's wish
and he is the one, who, being main
ly concerned, has the final say
that there be no contest or court

The reason the Republicans st'll
are unwilling to concede defeat is
that in the five States whose, vote

400.000 of the popular vote of the
country.
Tho President polled 2.270.694 more
votes Tuesday than ho did four yeai'x
ngo. Mr. Hughes obtained :o5,9.1S
more votes than Mr. Taft and Colonel
Roosevelt combined In the three-cornered
contest that year. ,
Hughes now has 20 votes In the Elec
toral College about which there Is llttlR
doubt. The Republicans figure Minne
sota will alaolM his. bilnglng his total
to 255. That Is eleven leas than the 3Hi
majority required In the Electoral Col
lege. If a recount should show New Hamp
shire Republican, bringing the Repub
lican total to 239, and Hughes should
gain soveral of California's electoral
votes on a split of electors, possible
undor the State laws, ho would a'-rlv
at the place where North Dakota's i"i
votes, or New Mexico's three, !
counted and found Republican, might
put him over Instead of Wilson.
Conferences Still On.
The endless conferences of Repuhllcan
managers were still on today. There
wero a few recriminations as what
the victorious Democrats facetiously re
ferred to as the "wako" proceeded at
tho Republican headquarters, but for
tho most part the leaders were plan
ning reorganisation of the party and
beginning already to look forward to
1620. One thing that gave cause for Jo
woa that the Democratic majority In
the House of Representatives has been
swept away. Wilson no longer has
complete domination in tho national
legislature.
No Outward Signs.
Outwnrdly, at least. Hughes Isn't
showing any signs of disappointment
over Indications that ho has just lost
out on tho biggest Job In America, j
The man who said, two days before
tha election, "If I am elected, as I
expect to be," and said It with con
viction ringing In hi voice, was Just
as Importurbably unconcerned as
when, a short six monthn ago. he sat
on tho bench of the Supreme Court of
tha United States In judicial calm.
There was no doubt that Hughes
was greatly moved Wednesday when
IA11IT I1H1K SWIi" " H.U I iiTiitnj
night conlneed he was elected, -awakeued
o find his opponent choien.
UNWILLING
