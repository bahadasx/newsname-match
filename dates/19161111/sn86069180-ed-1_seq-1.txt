JiERALD AGAIN MADE THE GOAT
The final returns from California
ftnd North Dakota "clinched the re
election of President Wilson, and
no juggling hy the Wall street
manipulators can change the result,
which is a victory for the people.
The story in our little old school
readers about the "Battle of Blen
heim," as told by the old grand
lather to his little grandson, re
minds one of the closing stanza In
each line, ' "Twas a famous vic
tory," and this famous victory pales
into insignificance when it ia real
ized how President Wilson defeated
Hughes, the Wall stree.t candidate,
and in defeating him beat the
money barons, stock speculators and
food trust leaders, who confi
dently believed that their wishes
were law In this country and that
-elections were only held to approve
of their dictatorship. As was re
"called in these columns last week,
Mt was a question of the people vs.
Wall street, and despite the terrible
handicap of boodle the people
achieved a famous victory. The Re
publican leaders stopped at nothing
to accomplish their ends. In addi
tion .to Introducing race and relig
ious prejudice they had their food
trusts, apd money barons attempt
to starve and "freeze the conimpo.
people by making prohibitive prices
on food and coal.
If there Is one beneficial result
from Tuesday's election it is the
fact thet the results knock out the
old stereotyped slogans, "As New
York goes so goes the nation," "As
Maine goes so goes the nation."
New' York and the East generally
believe that the boundaries of the
.United Strttes stop at the edge of
SiEoinuPteteB andUjatJthe irggt.
01 mo country is a nownng wuacr--ness.
This contempt Is always re
flected in the New York press,
which does not have a high regard
for the Intelligence of those outside
the boundaries of the effete East,
probably because other portions of
the country are not featured with
-jnonkey dinners and Thaw scan
dals. This feeling was reflected In
'the New York papers election night.
"The New York World, considered
tby many the strongest Wilson sup
porter in the United States, gave
up the contest without a struggle
because New York, Illinois and In
diana had .returned pluralities
galnst the President. During the
next several months It is expected
that some of our cohceited New
Yorkers will go on exploring ex
peditions and get a near view of
the South and West, the sections
that made them Bit up and take no
tice by their loyal support of Presi
dent Wilson.
The State of Kentucky did Itself
-proud in the result Tuesday, the
-prediction of 20,000 plurality In
'these columns last week being verl
'fled, and It Is hats off to Chairman
J. Campbell Cantrlll, who without
any flourish and self-advertisement
went ahead and scored the most
decisive national victory In this
State In over twenty years. Na
tional Republican Committeeman A.
T. Hert, the millionaire leader of
Republican destinies In this State,
who in dally interviews with not
only Kentucky papers, but In the
Eastern papers, was telling how he
had Kentucky In his vest-pocket for
the Republican ticket, some of the
press being gullible enough to
swallow this guff and show Ken
tucky -in their doubtful column.
Republican money was showered
here, the G. 0. P. leaders even con
fessing that they had dumped
540,000 Tiere, and no one can even
suess how much more they sent
here, not Included in their confes
sion. Kentucky Democrats are loud
in their praises of phalrman
Cantrlll's work and say that noth
ing is too good for him in the
future In the political arena.
Louisville and Jefferson county
Democracy are still crowing over
their wonderful showing, the Demo-
cratlo organization combatting
Raginst the biggest Republican
campaign in local history, it being
rumored that ?150 was allotted to
every precinct in the 228 located
in tuls distrjet. Added to this the
Democrats faced a negro vote of
11,000, which was corraled by the
Republicans and brought to the
polls before the polls opened,
negroes being dragged from the
alleys and slums, while those away
from home were given railroad fare
to come home and vote, many of
whom It is believed were not en
titled, to vote. Tor the last month
the negroes were pampered and
petted by the Chilton-Searcy ma
chine, their conduct being unbear
able on street cars and in public
places, While the iblg Wilson par
wim was passing .the Republican
lulqurt9rs, Saturday night hun
dreds of negroes, gathered from the
celored Tenderloin and slums,
openly Insulted the white men
marching la the parade. Tn this
' thfy were egged on by the white
'Republican leaders.

DANGER NOT PASSED.
The Irish Press and News Service
furnished the following letter bear
ing upon Ireland and conscription
from Padralc Cblum:
We are not yet free from the
dread that Ireland will again be
made the scone of revolt and re
prisal. These things will assuredly
flow from the application to the
country of any form of conscrip
tion. It Is true that the question
of conscription for Ireland was
brought up in the British House of
Commons when Parliament assem-;
bled a month ago and that then a
declaration was made that for the
present conscription would not be
applied there. But It should bo
remembered that military service
for Ireland could be enforced with
out discussion In the British Par
liament at all. An act known as
the militia ballot act is in exist!
ence. Under Its provisions a Mag-T
tstrato can summon the mien of
tdjstrlct together and make them
uraw Danois among tnemseives for
military service. When we real
ize -this fact we think less of ,thej
proceedings and the declarations In
the Imperial Parliament. Indeed
these proceedings and these declara
tions may have been lor the pur
pose of lulling the Irish into a
senso of security. The passing of
an act authorizing conscription
would be for the Government the
most dancerous method af nn.
proahnteAcbuntiywohld' -hare4
nine to lane warning and to be
come organized. Through the
militia ballot act men could In
many districts be held up, unwarned
and unorganized. It may be that
the Government Is only waiting for
Parliament to 'be dissolved and
measures got out of the way that
the Irish members could obstruct to
apply the provisions of the militia
ballot act.

WHAT WAR HAS DONE.
J. H. Donnelly, writing from
Coleralne,' says Ireland is not the
Ireland before the war. Politically
she is in chaos, the Parliamentary
party omy nominally leading her
and the soldiery in the saddle of
government as in the days of
Cromwell. The people are dejected,
harried, suspicious, class against
class, and civil war threatened. Tho
30,000 recruits obtained 1ft Belfast
have suffered frightfully Iri'tlie cfcs
ualty lists and the hatred exhibited
by their relative and friends at th
Ntrtionallflts who are "tqo proud 't'

Will That Fertile Country Face
Starvation During Next
Year?
Daily Toll of tnc Submarine Is
Fraught With Deadly
Peril.
Belfast Traders Storing Up Food
Products to Coin Great
Fortunes.
THE ONLY HOPE FOR RECRUITING
J. H. Donnelly, In his latest Irish
Press News Service letter, writes
from Belfast that the daily toll of
the submarine carry!ngto the bot
tom of the sea food intended for the
English mouths is fraught with
deadly peril to the people of Ire
land. So said a former Lord Mayor
of Belfast and one of the large
linen goods makers to your corre
spondent. Both are strong conscrlp
tlonlsts who aver that England will
be justified In commandeering all
of the food products of Ireland as
Boon as the submarine warfare
threatens a blockade In the open
seas. The navy men say they can
keep the Irish Channel open In any
event through destroyers and that
the munition workers of England
(3,000,000) must be fed first.
The high prices are tempting the
people to part with their food. The
finest cattle and lambs are belne
stripped from Ireland. The com
mandeering of various farm pro
ducts has led to more land being
used for grazing, as the Government
has not yet fixed a limit on the
price of cattle. Good clothing and
shoes are scarce and all products
bring enormous prices. Shrewd
Belfast traders realize what people
In other parts of Ireland do not
see and these speculators are bor
rowing great sums of money and
storing up food products to coin
great fortunes when grim famine
appears. The Belfast worker earn
ing $18 per week now spends $12
for himself and family to live. The
war has made many a Belfast man
abandon his thrifty habits and tem
perate living. Nowhere In Ireland
are to be found so many dissipated
persons, sunken women and low
living people a3 here in this once
prosperous city. The amount of
whisky consumed has Increased
more than 40 per cent, since tho
war one distiller said.
The sad economic neglect of Ire
land, the utter absence of any
boards or commissions aiming to
conserve the food supply, the taking
away frpm '"the soil the most
nutrlous products, foreshadows a
famine which may literally ex
terminate the population. As this
fear prows and suffering grows
acute this coming winter young

THE PEOPLE.
NEW ERA
riifi,
When Farmers Understand Ad
vantages Attained Through
Uighcr Education.
A Catholic College ThatRcincm-
bers Their Boys and Saves
Them.
St. Viator's atBourbonnais, 111.,
Offers Winter Course In
Agriculture.
THE LAND OWNER IN SOCIETY
We hear much about the im
portance of more and higher educa
tion nowadays, but little is meant
for the farmer boys. For the kind
of education which is offered would
take him from the farm. An oppor
tunity has at last been offered the
Catholic farmer by St. Viator's Col
lego at Bourbonnals, III., to send
his boys off to college and still keep
them on the farm. Taking Into
consideration that the farmer is
most busy from early spring until
late In fall, and that with the com
ing of winter his work stops, leav
ing him In comparative leisure and
Idleness the fathers of the college
have Instituted a short winter
course In agriculture, beginning No
vember 20, 1916, and ending April
5, 1917, Thus the farmer's young
son stays and works In tho nelds,
where he is needed by his father,
who can hardly get hired help any
more even for high wages, board
and lodging.
But with the coming of winter
the young farmer does not know
what to do. If he has finished the
country school, he aspired to go to
the High School in the nearest
town. The father consents, though
with many misgivings; for ho
knows the dangers which too bften
attend upon such a course, with
its lack of discipline and the
mingling of the sexes. Anyhow
the boy returns to work in tho
spring without having put off tho
dullness and slowness which the
popular mind attributes to tho
farmer.
Tho genuine remedy is for the
young man to throw off tho narrow
ness of his Immediate nelghborhod,
and go to a Cathollo college,
whero by meeting Catholic boys
from all parts of tho country, living
a regular life under the supervision
of the fathers, ho will draw out all
his hidden powers by serious study,
Tho fathers then engage experi
enced men, who fit tho boys for suc
cessful farming. They prepare
them for actual farm life. They
bring them Into contact with all
the problems and practices of the
farm, and the boys begin to realize
that agriculture is also a profes
sion, and that he who would get
pleasure and profit from his work
must have skill and knowledge.
At the same time a general high
school education is not overlooked.
A. course in English Is given, that
the young man may speak and
write tho , language correctly. But
t.ho one question is, what are the
terms of tho course? How much
Is It going to cost me? It costs
$150 for board, lodging, tuition and
all fees. This may appear high to
the farmer, who has never yet seen
the benefits of education. But
why not make a business proposi
tion with your boy? Something
like this: Your boy works faithfully
for you from April to November;
that Is eight months; pay him, let
us say, ?20 a month, as you pay
your hands every month. Put the
?20 In the bank and when Novem
ber comes around tho boy will know
that by his work he has earned
enough to pay his way through
college the coming winter. It will
bo the dawn of a new era for the
church when tho Catholic farmers
begin to understand the advantages
which come with a higher educa
tion. There Is no more romantic
llgure In society than the land
owner, whose steady toll is mingled
with the refinements of a higher
education. It's the ideal life. It
was tiie lire of the monks of St.
Benedict, those farmers that helped
to civilize Europe. By patient toll
they cleared thn Innrl hnt tVinw
"also by their educational wnrlr
trained the medieval youth In all
tho learning of the ancients.
Tho interested farmer can get all
information by writing to tho Presi
dent, Rev. J. P. O'Mahoney, C. S.,
V., St. Viator's College, Bourbon
nals, III.
WHY NOT NOW?
When America was convulsed
with a great civil war, Catholics and
Protestants stood shoulder to shoul
der. . Together they camped In the
swampg, marched through tho wild
erness, played, fought, suffered,
and their dust lies mingled upon
every battlefield of that desperate
war. And when peace was come,
together they set about peaceful
pursuits. Why can they not pre
serve that peace among themselves
In the spirit of Him who living and
dying enjoined upon all men to
"Love one another?"
The American constitution and
the constitution of each State guar
antee liberty of belief and worship.
Catholics- and Protestants in joint
assembly's' -rote th6se guarantees.
Why now listen to the designing
men who try to violate them? To
day in every section of the land, in
every city and township, In almost
every hamlet, Catholics and Prot'-
estants are living together as neigh
bora and friends. Why permit this
friendly relation to bo disturbed by
uncharitable. un-Chrlstlan and nn.
American appeals to prejudice, pas-
biuii uhu m-ieeiing Tomorrow, as
UidaJ'aadifi'origenerfttld'nPtoAttonie,''
Catholics, and Protestants must live
together as neighbors. Shall it not
be also as friends?
Catholics and Protestants to
gether settled America. Together
they laid the forests, drained tho
swamps and plowed the land. Thev
fought together In the battles of
the Revolution. They stood side
by side in the conventions and con
gresses that secured the liberties of
tho people. Why should they now
suffer self-seeking men to betray
them into hatred for one another?
When America outgrew her
colonial limits Catholics and Prot
estants, side by side, faced the toll
and danger of pioneer life. State
after State was carved out 'of the
great West. City after city arose.
Railroads crossed the broad wastes
and bridges spanned the deep
streams. And all was the joint work
of Catholics and Protestants. There
Is no State but where they live to
gether, do business together, vote
together; no city but where their
churches together lift their spires
toward the same heaven; no rail
road, telegraph, express and hardly
a mill, factory or mine but whero
their moneys and their interests are
joined hand In hand. Then why
should Catholics and Protestants
not continue to live together In
peace? Columblad.

Interest Aroused by Interview
With Chief of tho Army
Stnff,
Situation Entirely Satisfactory
and Proniis'cs to Bo So 1h
tFuture.
J
No One Can Foretell .When tho
End of tho War Will
Come.
DAY OF RECKONING IS COMING
Considerable Interest has hnnn
aroused by an interview given to a
representative of tho Vienna Neue
Frole Presse by tho Chief of the
German Staff, Field Marshal ,von
Hlndenburg. The situation, as he
sees It, is entirely satisfactory and
promises to be bo in tho future.
Prophesying be considered an un-
grateful task, and no one could
foretell when tho end of tho war
would come. It was not, however,
Impossible that decisive battles
might be fought In 1917. -No one
thought of peace at the present,
moment. Tho numerical strength
of Russia did not greatly Impress"
him: "There Is no doubt that new
troops will bo levied In Russia, but
that makes no difference; we, too,
have enough men. Germany has a
profusion of reserves, and in Austria-Hungary
tho reserves are by
no means exhausted."
The French, he thought, wero ex
terminating themselves by their
method of fighting. "All their
tenacity wjll Jbe of no avail, for in
the end there will bo none of them
left. This fate of the French na
tion Is owing abovo all else to the
British. If tho British ask next
spring for one more offenslvo cam
paign they will rob France of tho
remainder of her army and of her
national strength." Asked whether
the decision of tho war lay in the
East, he disclaimed any final pro
gramme with this end in view:
"There is no prepared pro
gramme, except this one, to gain
victory. Whero and how that will
be done can only be decided each
moment anew on t.he basis of events
Therefore a decision can be looked
fOr as Well nn In thn Unaf no (a
lj .WJ-i --.-.. .. .- J . ..
tell you that I Intend to shorten
my iront in the West. I never
thought of It Why should I do
it? The front in the West standa
as Arm as a rock, and If our
enemies by gigantic use of artillery
hero and there gain a little terri
tory, they will never break through.
In order to do this they would
still have to attack for thirty years,
provided they had enough men."
The entrance of Rumania into
the war. he said, was heartily wel
comed by him. "By means of it
we got out of trench warfare. Tho
Rumanians are In retreat and the
day of reckoning is coming."
Lieut. Gen. von Stein, com
mander of the Fourteenth Reserve
Army Corps, has been appointed
Prussian Minister of War in placo
of Lieut. Gen. Adolph Wild von
Hohenborn. The latter was sent
to take command of an army corps
on the Western front. Tho reason
given for the change Is tho need of
a War Minister who has had prac
tical experience of conditions at
the front, this being necessary to
enable him to decide with prudence
upon military measures at home.
As late as two months ago Lieut.
Gen. von Stein had commanded
troops in the Somme sector of the
German front in the vicinity of
Thlepval. Like his predecessor,
who succeeded Gen. von Falken
hayn, he had held the post of
Quartermaster General.
LEXINGTON WEDDINGS.
Two weddings of prominent per
sons took -place In LexlOPtnn nn
Wednesday. That of Miss Laura de
Lavlllon KInkead to Samuel B.
Walton was solemnized at 1 n'ninnt
at Lyndhurst. the home of the
oride's parents here. The Rev.
Father de Waegenaere, of St. Paul's
church, performed the ceremony.
The wedding was a very simple and
quiet affair, as the family of the
bridegroom are In mourning, but
the arrangements were elegant. The
entire house was decorated In new
palo pink Ophelia roses. The
couple stood in the archway for
the ceremony. Luncheon was served
in the dining room, the table having
in Its center an Immense brlde'rf
cake. After the wedding the couple
left for a trip to New York, and
while there will see the bride's
aunt, Mrs. Annlo Stone Maxwell,
who was unable at the last moment
to attend the wedding.
Miss Katherlne Reglna Slavln and
