FARM & STOCK SHOW
IMPORTANT EVENT
Will Be a Demonstration of
Great Importance to the
Farmers of State.
E. G. Davis, president of the Cov
in'gton Bank & Trust Company, Louis
M. !Bourgeois, cashier of the St. Tam
many SBank & Trust Company, and
D. tH. Mason, editor of The St. Tam
many Farmer, made the rounds of
Covington, Thursday, and secured
from Covington merchants funds suf
ficient to send eighteen or twenty
farmers to the Farm and Stock Show
in New Orleans,. from November 11
to 19, 1916. This show is being
gotten uP on a grand scale and
should be of great ,benefit to the
State. The'- exhibits of stock and
farm p'roducts will be a reelation of
what is being done in this line In
Louisiana and elsewhere, and St.
Tammany parish can ill afford to
lose the opportunity of learning the
lesson that will Ibe taught there.
Our own fair has just ended, and it
is acknowledged that it has been a
-beneficial ,influence in the progress of
the parish and a stimulus to increas
ed effort for the years that are to
follow, but the opportunity of learn
ing things of importance to the
farmer was trivial compared to the
opportunities of learning that Iwill be
presented at the New Orleans show.
It will be a revelation to those farm
ers who have not had the opportuni
ty for extensive travel, and more may
b.e learned there in a few days than
by months 6f study and reading, be
cause it will give the results of years
of experimentation and put these re
sults in a shape to be easily compre
hended. It will rbe a visual demon
stration off what may Ibe accomplish
ed by any farmer or stock raiser who
,folloiws the tfoot-prints mde by the
successful men of the country. Its
lesson will be practical and convinc
ing and te Sflhnancial gains a tempta
tion not to be resisted.
The Press Club of New Orleans
and enterprising citizens of that
place have shouldered heavy expens
es to make this show one of the most
'wonderful that has ever been pre
sented to the people of this section
of the' South and to induce people
to attend it. There should be co--1
operation from every part of the
iState and the show should (bring
good results to every parish.

GENERALLY CONCEDED THAT
WILSON IS NEXT PRESIDENT
Returns Are Slow and Some Recounts Have Switched the
Results. Amendments Seem to Have All Been Car
ried Except No.. 5, Allowing Women ofi Boards.
Wilson's election was received with
enthusiasm by the people of St. Tam
many parish, especially as the first
reports of morning papers chronicl
ed the election of Hughes. The ex
tra edition of the Times-tPicayune
corrected the morning report and
reached Covington on the same train
as the first edition. The States
brought news of Wilson's election,
in the evening, and conifirmed the re
iports that were received from pri
.vate sources over the wire and
phone. 'A few Wilson men made
:bets that Hughes would ibe elected.
Uncertainty Ended.
New York, Nov. 9.-The returns
of today cleared up in the measur'e
the uncertainties regarding Connec
ticut, West Virginia and North Da
kota. The results in those states
Justified the awarding of the seven
.men from Connecticut and the eight
from West Virginia to Mr. Hughes,
Ibringing his apparant total up to
,247.
While the returns from all these
states probably will be disputed by
one side or the other, it is not prob
able that any contests -will affect the
general result.
The last figures from Minnesota
showed that with eighty-five pre
cincts to be heard from, Mr. Hughes
has a majority of 73. The vote of
the militiamen from that state sta
tioned on the Mexican border is to .be
counted on next Tuesday. The com
,missioners sent to record it have re
,ported that "apparently not more
than 700 have voted for President
Wilson out of a total of 2136."
The Democratic -managers still in
ist that the final returns from Min
nesota will show a majority for the
President.

'Be it further ordained, etc., That
the municipalities of Mandeville and
Oovington be and the same are-here
by declared to be exempt under their
respective chartern from the payment
d(Cmti sa-a PFage f.)
T'hey are paying their bets with a
glad and thankful heart.
Abita Springs cast 26 votes for
the Socialists, and there were 1
Republican votes cast in Covington,
it is reported.
All of the Constitutional Amend
mcents, except No. 5, allowing wo
men on School Boards, etc., carried
by good majorities in St. Tammany
parish. No. 5 was the only amend
ment defeated in the State.
Conlgressional election in the Third
,District is claimed by both candi
dates. Congressman Whit Martin
claims it by 86 majority; Sheriff
Wade Martin claims it by 81'.
In New Hampshire, 'where the re
.nurns seesawed for two days between
,President Wilson and Mr. Hughes,
the latest available Ogures, with
twenty-five towns still to hear from,
show a majority for Mr. Hughes of
1131. The Dyqmocratic state commit
tee, however, claims the state by 125.
Complexion of Congress.
Congress at late reports received
showed 216 Democrats, 211 Republi
cans, 2 Progressives and 1 Independ
ent and 1 Socialist in the (House with
Tour .districts unreported. In the
Senate the reports showed ffty-two
Democrats, forty-three Repulblicans
and" one doubtful (New Mexico).
This represents a Democratic House
majority of one over all Others and a
Democratic Senate majority of nine
with one missing.
In an official statement the Demo
cratic national committee claimed
272 votes for President Wilson and
a popular plurality of from 200,000
to 300,000.
"To say there will be a contest,"
declared the statement, "in an insult
to the intelligence of the American
people."
It probably witll be another day .be
fore the full results are known from
any of the four states left in the
doubtful column, and certaimly not
until there has been an offleial count

A NEW DEPOT
ONE)F THINGS
.NEEDED BY
COVINGTON
Old Structure No Longer
Meets Demands of Traffic;
Lacks Conveniences.
THE ASSOCIATION OF
COMMERCE P L A N S
New Orleans Great North
ern Will Be Asked to
Meet Requirements.
At a recent meeting of the Asso
ciation of 'Commerce it was decided
that. Covington was badly in need of
a depot that would be an ornament
to the town as !well .as be able to
properly take care of its business.
The (present depot is an eye-sore,
which teat was never so well dem
onstrated as rwhen it was recently
attempted to get a photograph of it
for the Covington Booster Book. It
was finally decided that it would be
better not to put the picture in the
book, so a scene of disembarkation
was taken as the peog~le filed out and
walked down the street at a distance
from the depot. It was then and
there decided that some effort must
be made to have a new depot- built.
To this end a committee will be ap
pointed to confer with the 'N. O. G.
N. and to take whatever steps may
'be necessary to accomplish the
object.
Aside from the appearance of the
structure, the public is shut off from
the ordinary conveniences that every
depot sohuld bal~e, and in rainy
weather (passengers, sick or well,
must alight in the rain.
CATTLE TICK IS
BEING DRIVEN
FROM STATE
Estimated That Louisiana
Will Be Tick Free by 1919
and Some States 1 Year.
Washington, ID. C., Nov 9.--Be
cause of the spirit of co-operation
among the people of the South in the
work of eradicating the tick which
transmit* Texasiever to cattle, this
destructive and expensive pest should
be eliminated from the territory of
the United States within the next
Ove years, according to the Field In
spection Division of the Bureau - of
Animal Industry of the U. e. Depart
ment of Agriculture. Enthuisasm
in the .ight against the pest is run
ning particularly high in several of
the eleven tick-infested Southern
States and these ooipmonwealths will
free their territory within the neat
year or so, the division predicts. In
eight of the States, it is believed,
the work will be completed within
four years.
An outline of conditions in the
tick infested territory, recently pre
pared, shows that Virginia, only four
counties in which are now under
quarantine, can be -made tick free
by one year's active work, and, that
because of the interest now being
shown there, the quarantine is like
ly to lbe removed from the last bit
of previosusly tick-infested territory
in the State early in 1918. South
Carolina, which is pushing the eradi
cation work steadily forward, shouid
achieve freedom from treks the same
year. By the end of 1917, it is cal
culated, there should be but 15
counties in Alalbama remaining in
quarantine, and these, at the rate
the State has been working, should
be cleaned up the following year.
For Mississappi probably the most
accurate prediction can be made.
The legislature of that State recent
ly enacted a law~requiring that all
counties now in the quarantined area
shall eradicate the tick during 1917.
The people showed their interest in
this step immediately, and nearly all
the infested counties already have
appropriated funds for the building
of dipping vats in preparation for the
State-wide eradication campaign.
State-wide tick eradication legisla
tion also has been enacted in Lou
isiana. As a result, this State can
expect to be free of fever ticks by
the end of 1919.
Oklahoma, it is believed, will clear
its territory el fever ticks within the
next three years. In Arkansas, dip
ping vats are in course of construc
tion in practically every county of
the State and soon .ill be in general
use. It is believed that tick eradl
cation will be completed In this State
by the end at .0l2. The same year,

work of tick eradication, and prob
abily will require most of the Ave
year period to bring about the re
moval of quarantine from their ter
ritory. Tease .has more counties
quarantined because of the presence
of the fever tick than any other
State, and has almost as many square
.miles in the quarantined area as all
the other States coabined. It Is
probable, therefore, that the work of
eradication there will 'take more
bime and that unless there is unfore
seen activity, Texas will be the last
of the States to claim a white area
on the maIp. The finishing of the
work of eradication in the other
States, however, will release Federal
agents engaged in the iwork and will
make V*ossible the concentration of
effort on Texas toward -the end of
the five-year period. It is belleved,
therefore, that by the close of the
year 1921 this concerted work, if
properly supported by local co-opera
tion. will result in tick eradiotiten
from Texas and the dreeing, there
fore, of eall United States territory
from the pest.
'As a result of extermination of the
cattle tick from approximately 285,
000 square miles in the ten years
which the U. S. Department of Agri
culture and the States have beena
aatively engaged in the wor.k, the
cattle industry, acording to the
Bureau of Animal Industry, in the
Soath has improved from 50 to 100
per cent. Native beet cattle, freed
from attacks of the ticke, have pat
on more flesh; native dairy cows are
giving more milk; and, because dan
ger of disease largely has been elimt
nated, cattle of better breeds havre
been brought in to improve the ns
tive stock. The South has made
greater progress l developing the
cattle industry in the last 5 years in
the preceeding 50 years, and there
has been more progress in the in
dustry in the South in that period
than in any other section.
The States and counties, rallwayr
and other corporatiolns, and busl
ness men of the Soath have been ac
tive in' emphassisng the great im
portance of tick eradication end in
spreading interest and information
among farmers and eattlemen. As
a result of the operation of all these
forces, the work of tick eradication
practically has been half completed.
On July, 1, 1916, there had been
freed from ticks 284,521 square
miles of the original quarantined
area of 728,543 square miles. It is
estimated that by next December
60,000 additional square miles 'ill
be freed, bringing the total tick-ree
territory to 344,531 square mles.
This will leave aetotal area under
quarantine of 384,023 square miles.
