WOULD KEEP TOBACCO ADS
OUT OF THE NEWSPAPERS
Having Barred Liquor Notices From Journals ln"Dry" Mississippi,'
Legislators Will Consider Bill Whereby Prohibition Cranks
Seek to Further Assail the Freedom of the Press
T. Mill
rs
212 N. 2nd
Money to Loan Opposit of Kress
The claim has boon otton mado that
prohibition oventually will monaco tho
freedom of tho proaB. Those ho now
aim to prevent tho making or consum
lnc of liquor, dancing, card playing,
amoklng, Sunday basoball and thea
ters, eventually, It la said, will attempt
to dictate tho policy of nowapapora.
This story was printed in tho Jackson
(Miss) News:
The following Is from tho current is
sue of the East Mississippi Times,
published at Starkvillo:
The biggest and most profitable
advertisers to the country news
paper at present are tho manufac
turers of tobacco, cigars and ciga
rettes. They are sending out some
good cash contracts and the new s
Mnors of tho stato will reap a
rich harvest unloss a lot of Idiotic
imbeciles meet In Jackson next
year and paaa a law prohibiting
Mississippi newspapers from ad
vertising tobacco.
And that'a just what is likely to hap
pen at the next session of tho Legis
lature. If a lot of cranks and professional
reformers, led by an alien fanatic, can
pass law prohibiting newspapers
from publishing liquor advertisements,
they can, with the same sort of logic,
coerce and Intimate the lawmakers
Into passing a law prohibiting the pub
llcntlon -of tobacco advertising. i
Worao still, if tho loglblatdro can
toll tho nowBpapors w hat thoy ahall, or j
shall not publlsn m tneir auverusiiiB
columns, It Is hut anothor stop to toll
ing them what thoy ahull, or ahall uot,
publlnh In their news columna.
And it la then bat anothor atop to
tho establishment by statuto of a rigid
censorship of editorial columnn.
What then, brethren of tho pen and
pencil, will become of our constitu
tional guaranteo of tho liborty of tho
press?
No odltor or publisher who has a
truo reverence for his calling, who at
taches any valuo whatsoover to tho
constitutional clauso that declares tho
liborty of the press Bhall novcr bo
abridged, can che.'Ish any respect
whatoor for tho Wcakloy untl adver
tising atatuto.
A frco and untrammelled press has
mado tho United States tho groatost
government in tho world, and It truo
Domocracy over porlshoa from tho
face of tho earth it will bo because we
havo allowed domagoguos, charlatans
and profesuloual roformor3 to muzlo
tho press.
Givo the fakirs of this typo an inch
and the will tako a mile. Thoy havo
already taken tho Inch. Will tho
I proas of Mississippi permit them to go
tho full aistanco?
