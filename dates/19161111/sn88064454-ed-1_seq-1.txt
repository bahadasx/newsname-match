Stop The First Cold
A cohl does not get well of Itself. The
pr",cess of wearing out a cold wears you
out. and your cough becomes serious if
neglected. Hacking coughs drain the
energy and sad the vitality. For 47
years the happy combination of sooth
ilng antiseptic balsams in Dr. King's
New Discovery has healed coughs and
relieved congestion. Young and old can
testify to the effectiveness of Dr. King's
New lDiscovery for coughs and colds.
