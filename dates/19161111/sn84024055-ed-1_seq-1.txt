o thing that caused very cold
l"ls to run up and down the backs
" t5o prominent Republican politicians
the fact that the great state of
h'o which has always been one of the
6st rock ribbed Republican states in
e Union, with its sixty-five to seventy
thousand Colored voters -wheeled into
J18 'or resident Wilson, so far it is
hard to nrcnnnJf fnfr this fact.
contend that it simply shows Jlt
'wira pi...i -n Tr v. -l. -
f voto getter, and the election re-
from that state seem to indicate
tat was the main trouble -with
him in all the important states except
ing four or five.
Col. Frank O. Lowden with both
hands down was elected Governor of
Illinois defeating Governor Edward P.
Dunne by almost two hundred thou
sand majority, although Governor
Dunne carried his home town, Chicago,
but he was unable to overcome the
great lead of Col. Lowden in Cook
county and throughout the lower part
of this state, Governor Dunne ran far
ahead of President Wilson in this city
and in Cook county which was a high
tribute to his popularity and to his
record as-Governor of one of the best
and one of the greatest states of the
sisterhood of states. All the candi
dates of tho Republican state ticket
with large majorities, they are as fol
lows: Governor, Frank O. Lowden; Lieu
tenant Governor, John G. Oglesby;
Secretary of State, Louis L. Emmerson;
Auditor of Public Accts., Andrew Rus
sel; State Treasurer, Len Small; Attor
ney General, Edward J. Brundage;
Congressman at Large, William E. Ma
son; Congressman at Large, Medill Mc
Connick. Hon. Maclay Hoyn,e, after one of the
most bitter and violent fights that was
pulled off between any of the candi
dates t badly defeated Hon. Harry B
Miller in the race for state's attorney
of Cook county; thoso who camo in un
der tho wire ahead of their rivals in
Cook county are as follows:
State's Attorney, Maclay Hoyne,
Dem.; Recorder, Joseph. F. Haas, Rep.;
Circuit Clerk, Augusf W. Miller, Rep.;
Superior Clerk, John Kjellandor, Rep.;
Coroner, Peter M. Hoffman, Rep.; As

Trustees, Charles H. Sergei, Rep.; Mat
thias A. Mueller, Rep.; Janes H. Law
ley, Rep.; Circuit Judge, Robert E.
Crowe, Rep.; Superior Judge, Joseph
Sabath, Dem.
Hon. Joseph E. Haas was elected
Recorder -of Deeds, running all over
Hon. Joseph P. Connery, the present
Recorder and as this paper loyally sup
ported Mr. Haas we have every reason
to believe that he will make a first
class public official.
Col. August W. Miller won out in his
successful race for clerk of thOyCircuit
Court, defeating the Hon. John W.
Rainey who very foolishly entertained
the idea that he held a long term lease
on that dead easy job.
Hon. Peter M. Hoffman had no
trouble in being re-elected Coroner of
Cook county with almost eighty-five
thousand majority at his back. Hon.
Martin B. Madden was in an easy walk
re-elected to Congress from the 1st
Congressional District of Illinois.
To the great regret of his many
friends, Hon. Oscar Hebel, fell on the
outside of the breast works in the race
for Judge of the Superior Court, Judge
Joseph Sabath snatching the judgeship
prize away from him.
The newly elected Judges of the
Municipal Court follow:
John R. Newcomer, Rep., 237,837;
Hosea W. Wells, Rep., 220,931; Wells

THE OPINION OF THE DEMOCRAT
IC ADMINISTRATION OF THE
NEGRO SOLDLER.
E. H. Williamson, the up-to-date and
progressive undertaker and funeral di
rector, at 5028 S. State street, continues
to hold his own in his line of business
and ' he is ever ready to relieve the
wants of those who are in need of some
one engaged in" his line of business
when death knocks at their deor.
A southern Congressman, Carraway
of Arkansas, introduced a bill (H. R.
17183) in Congress to prevent tho en
listment of Negroes in the Army or
Navy departments of the United
States. The bill was demolished by
Democratic Senator Thomas Taggart of
Indiana during the last Congress and
died for want of nourishment from the
Democratic majority.
Senator Taggart of Indiana wrote to
Secretary of War Baker, in part, as
follows:
"I feel sure that this bill docs not
meet with the wishes of the War De
partment. There are several occasions
that call to my mind tho valor and
loyalty of the Negro soldiers, and only
recently their bravery was shown at
Carrizal, Mexico.
"I am opposed to the bill.
"Hoping to hear from your depart
ment that this bill does not meet with
your approval.
Secretary of War Baker, also a
TlATmnmt annrATwd in Tlftrt as follows:
I If ft 1.111 W1.....1J1 .aj.a!ta 4ra
I --jMiy tuut uut. nwiuu acvciio wo i
disapproval and adverso recommenda
tion of this department."
"Those who are familiar with tho
history of our country from the armies
organized by George Washington in
the American Revolution down to tho
present day, know what brave and
often conspicuously gallant service has
been rendered by Colored troops. In
tho most recent instance, at Carrizal,
in Mexico, these Colored troops con
ducted themeslves with the grerstest in
trepidity, and reflected nothing but
honor upon the uniform they wore."
Had Carraway 's bill embodied
either the sentiment of the President
or tho policy of tho Democratic ma
jority in Congress, it would have passed
with a rush.
Had Carraway 's bill been tho sen
timent of President Wilson, tho 8th
Regiment of Illinois would not have
been mustered into tho regular army
and sent to tho border with 100,000
White state troops; nor would our
Lieutenant Colonel Young have been
promoted from his rank of Major to
that of second in command of his regi
ment in the regular army, now in
Mexico. The Emancipation, October
