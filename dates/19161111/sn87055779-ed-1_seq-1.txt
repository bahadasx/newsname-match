PROVING THAT IT
PAYS TO ADVERTISE
1 1 t r r. ri t i r I News Scrvi-e:
HP'AC.n, Nov. 11. The re-
Mi'.t of Tuesday's election w'a.s
th- greatest proof ever offered of
the value f intelligent news
pillar advertising, advertising ex
perts pointed out today. Their
conclusions were generally shared
by men f round the western
headquarters of both political
parties.
Hast of the Mississippi the
republicans out-advertised the
democrats three to one. Hughes
swept New York, Indiana, Illi
nois and most of the so-called
eastern pivotal states.
West of the Mississippi the re
puMPans did very little adver
tising in newspapers. The demo,
crats swamped the papers with
advertising in the western states.
Hughes carried only three states
west of the Mississippi and h'o
kisses in that region defeated
hin for the presidency.
WOMEN PLEASED
10 ELECTION
Were For Hughes, But Now
That It's All Over Will
Bury Hatchet.
Intern;itbn:l News Service:
CIIICACO, Nov. 11. Whatever
be the ultimate outcome of the
election recounts, contests and in
discriminate disputes which threat
en to becloud the political horizon
for days to come, the women voter
won an overwhelming victory at the
polls Tuesday. This is the opinion
of practically all suffrage leaders
excepting those who were actively
partisan in the campaign ;us they
were expressed to the International
News service today.
The women regard their victory
not in Pres"t Wilson's ie-election,
but in the formidable array of their
own power which almost prevented
it.
The women at the start of the
campaign went' out "to get Mr.
Wilson's scalp." IIcw close they
came to getting it can be seen in
the electoral vote. Rut now that
it's all over, they are willing to bury
the hatchet, go back to Washington
for the opening of congress and
tight tooth and nail for a national
amendment which will insure all
women the ballot.
This was, briefly, the outline of
the situation, as explained teulay hy
Miss Alice Raul, who led the tight
against the president from her place
as directing head of the woman's
party.
"From a suffrage standpoint,"
she said today, "I believe, if any
thing, we can perhaps be as glad
we ,ot Mr. Wilson as Mr. Hughes.
We won't have to educate Mr. Wil
son any more on the suffrage ques
tion. VVV might Mr. Hughes. Mr.
Wilson knows what we want, and
he says he is with us.

Corrupt Practices Act "With
Teeth" Expected to be
Passed by Congress.
International News Serri:
WASHINGTON. Nov. 11. A cor
rupt practices act "with teeth" will
be one of the lirst pieces of legisla
tion which Pres't Wilson will ask of
congress. Just what form it will
take is not yet decided on. but it is
certain that It will limit expenditures
of money by national committees in
presidential and congressional elec
tions. It will also be so drawn that
a stop will be put on enormous ex1
penditures by individuals on their
own responsibility. According to in
formation reaching here there was
much of the latter done in the re
cent ca.mnaiirn and both mihIo VmH
the benefit.
Talk of a congressional investia-!
tion to determine how much money
w as used had died dow n here. For I
f f. J - - - - - J ' A v. i
a time certain democratic leaders i
were insisting that they had evi
dence that an enormous corruption
fund had been used against the re
election of Pres't Wilson, but now
they admit they have no evidence to !
support any such contention. It is
expected that the western repub
licans will work with the democrats
in framing the corrupt practices act
and that it is certain that it in no
way will be a partisan measure.
Senators and representatives who
are returning here today agreed that
the money spent in the recent cam
paign waa far too much.
The great question confronting
the politicians is what line the new
political combination of the south
and west will take in its legislation.
There is no question that the west
ern congressmen will demand real
recognition from the Wilson admin
istration and there seemed to be a
strong possibility that many fat jobs
now held by eastern democrats will
be switched over to the men of the
plains and mountains who did yeo
man service for Ires't Wilson in the
battle of last Tuesday.
So far as cabinet changes are con
cerned, it was stated on authority
today that this is one matter to
which the president has paid no at
tention. It naturally is accepted
that there will be some changes as
two or three of the members of the
present cabinet are anxious to go
back to private life. However, it is
understood that Pres't Wilson will
pay no attention to possible changes
until after the first of the year.
