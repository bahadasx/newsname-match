New York, Nov. 21. Charles E.
Hughes, while not conceding that he
has been defeated for President, made
It clear yesterday that he would coun
tenance no hasty or Ill-considered
charges of fraud being made against

absence of absolute proof of traud no
euch cry should be raised to becloud
the title of the next President of the

evening to witness the opening game
or the grammar school -basketball
league, with the 8th grade winning
from the tith grade, division K, by a
score of 315-4.

showed real sportsmanship as good
losers. Although on the small end of
the score, their classmates won a vic
tory in the gallery where they out
cTieered the Sth grade cheering sec
tion. Throughout the game the spirit of
fairness prevailed and the play was
clean. For the 8th grade, Stoppilio,

NO WASHINGTON SPLIT
President Will Receive All of State's
Seven Votes.
Seattle, Wash., Nov. 11. So far as
was known here yesterday, the name
of E. M. Connor, nominated as demo
cratic presidential elector to succeed
Capt. A. T. Stieam, who died sudden
ly a week before the election, was on
every ballot voted In Washington,
hence, President Wilson will receive
the full seven votes of the state. In
the counties where the ballots had
already been printed, the name of

Stream and no votes were cast for

VERMONT TURKEYS RARE
Chittenden County Flocks 20 Per Cent
Below Average.
The Vermont turkey is this year
just as line and fat a bird as in other
years, but not so numerous by a Ions
way. Therefore, being a choice bird
both ti and outside of the state, he
will cost more, according to the Bur
lington Free Press.
How much more remains to be seen.
Manager S. P. Pago of Swift & Co.
says six or seven cents more a pound
than last year to the dealers, which of
course means the same amount pre
sumably to those who eat them.
There are comparatively few large
flocks, and tanners in many cases are
holding off for higher prices. One of
the big houses may not buy any Ver
mont turkeys, says its manager. A
local butcher has contracted for about
200 birds, at the market price at time
of purchase. Western and southern
turkeys will be about as abundant aa
usual. Vermont, however, prefers its
own birds if it can get them.
Milton, the Georgias Fast Georgia,
West Georgia and Georgia Plains
Starksboro, Huntington and to a less
extent the Island, Grand Isle, Isle La
Motte and North and South Hero, are
the chief producers in the northern
end of the state. The island's poultry
is usually pretty plentiful.
The biggest flock yet heard from is
one in the Georgias, said to number
several score birds.
Mi( higan is one of the chief produc
ers westward and Kentucky in the
South. Virginia and Iowa, Minnesota,
Illinois, etc., are other states that fur
nish more than enough turkey for
home eating.
The lowest price mentioned in town
yesterday was 31 to 32 cents to re
tailers. Wholesalers seemed agreed
that 35 to 40 cents would be about
the figure they would have to charge
retailers. One big wholesaler has had
some call for western turkey and la
Just beginning to buy Vermont birds.
Vermont turkey is expected to be In
the usual demand in Uoston, where it
ranks hardly second even to Rhode
Island turkey. New York usually pre
fers Kentucky turkey, but isn't very
squeamish oik; way or the other.
There is a bigger supply, relative to
that of any recent year, of chickens
than turkeys in the state. "No fancy
chickens are coming in," says the
Howes' market. "I look for a, high
chicken market and a poor one, too.
There are plenty of chickens, but they
are not being fed corn meal at $2.40
a bushel. They can be gotten any
where hereabouts. All feeds is
high."

FOR FLETCHER'S
CASTO R ! A
FIGHT WAS SHARP
WILSON TELLS
COLLEGE BOYS
President's First Public Comment
Made at Williamstown
TIME TO END PARTISANSHIP
All of Us Should Now Address Our
selves to the Welfare of the
Nation.
Williamstown, Nov. 11. "Now that
the campaign is over, we may all ad
dress ourselves to the welfare of the
nation without thought of irtlsan
feeling." To a group of 500 Williams
college- boys and townspeople Presi
dent Wilson, hero to rest lor two days
from the strain of the campaign and
to act as godfather at the christening
of his granddaughter, Kleanor Axson,
daughter of Mrs. Francis II. Say re.
made the first speech since his re
election. "The fight was a sharp one," he
said, "but politics Is after all a means
of getting things done, of putting fur
ward ideas. It is a fight but the man
who dots not love the light has no
red blood In his veins."
A "long cheer for Wilson." made
very "good", brought tho president
and Mrs. Wilson out on the porch of
his son-in-luw's home soon after &
o'clock. Although it was officially
announced that h came here for
quiet, and that no band or red fire
demonstrations would be welcome, he
obviously enjoyed the celebration. He
laughed with the college boys when
he told them that when it "came to
practical politics, he thought some of
them could give the 'regular fellows'
pointers." lie preached to them a lit
tle, telling them to "be true to what
you believe" and finished on the fight
ing theme by telling a story of a man
who, when offered a sword and a
horn, chose the horn first. Immedi
ately the sword vanished. After the
eptMJU he remained standing on the
porch while the crowd cheered am:
the boys serenaded with the famous
Williams song, "Tho Mountains."
Led by Stanley Young, chairman of
the student council. and Norman
White, head cheer leader, the entire
college body assembled at the Lasell
gymnasium at 5 o'clock and marched
up the street singing Williams songs
and cheering to the Sayre home. Here
the 500 students were met by 200
townspeople. Sam P. lllagden, chair
man of tlu? board of selectmen, wel
comed the president to the town In a
speech of two sentences. President
Harry A. Garfield, who gave the col
lego's official welcome, declared that
the president's words during the cam
paign had been "full of wisdom and
light." "We wish you Godspeed In
your great office, " he said.
At 3.30 the pinall group of people
assembled at the St. John's Episcopal
church to see the party enter were re
warded by the sight of two automo
biles carrying the guests and the se
cret service men. In the first automo
bile were President and Mrs. Wilson,
Mr .and Mrs. Sayre. Mr. Nevins, broth
er of Mr. Sayre and a secret service
man. The second automobile con
tained more secret service men and
the baby's nurse.
President and Mrs. Wilson alighted
first and waited for the rest of the
party to get out of the car. Mrs. Wil
son was dressed in a black velvet coat
with black fox trimmings, under
which was a blue Georgette crepe af
ternoon dress. She wore a hunch of
violets which matched her hat of roy
al purple. Mrs. Sayre held the baby
until they arrived, when the father
took her and carried her into tho
church. The regular Episcopal bap
tismal service was read by Hev. J.
Franklin Carter.
President Wilson and the baby's
uncle, J. Nevin Sayre, acted as god
fathers, while the godmothers were
Mrs. K. II. Sayre, grandmother of Ele
anor Axson Sayre, Misses Margaret
Wilson and Miss lllanche Nevin, the
baby's aunts. During the service the
baby was perfectly quiet, bins in her
father's arms, but just toward tho
close she gave evidence of her pres
ence by a few cries.
Toniglit the family had dinner to
gether at the Sayre home. The presi
dent will remain in Williamstown un
til 5.25 o'clock tomorrow afternoon
and then will return to Washington,
whore he is due to arrive Sunday
night. Tomorrow he will remain
quietly with his family, attending, if
the weather is favorable, tho Williams-Massachusetts
agricultural col
lege football game in the afternoon.

German Undersea Freighter Won't
Leave Until Next Week.
New London, Ct., Nov. ft. The Ger
man'merchant submarine Deutschland
will not start her homeward trip to
morrow as was originally planned. To
night it was stated her departure
might be delayed until next week.
Failure of some cargo to arrive here
on time is the reason assigned for
delay.
HEADQUARTERS DESERTED
Democrats Need $270,000 More for
Campaign.
New York, Nov. 11. Republican na
tional headquarters were deserted
early last night. Chairman W. It.
Wlllcox announced that he would not
be on hand again except for confer
ences. The democratic national com
mittee apparently considers tho cam
paign closed, for the work of dis
mantling headquarters is well under
way. Chairman Vance C. McCormick
spent the night at a hotel in New
York city and probably will go to ills
home at Harrisburg today. Henry
Morgentiiau, chairman of the democra
tic finance commutes announced yes
terday that the committee is now
$270,000 short, owing to the expenses
of the last few days of the campaign
and since election.
NEW JOB FOR UNCLE SAM
Has Gained Release of Many Young
sters Who Enlisted in Canada
Washington, Nov. 3.. Of the many
unexpected duties of the United States
lias found thrust upon it by the world
war one of the strangest Is that of
rescuing adventurous boys who enlist
in the European armies.
There have been more than a thous
and such cases since the war began,
and even ikw letters praying for the
release of young soldiers of fortune
pour into the state department at the
rate of 50 a day. It has been necessary
to assign an official to give special at
tention to the subject.
The story almost always Is the
same. The youngster, generally be
tween 16 and 20, suddenly disappears
and is next hoard from when he writes
home from Canada or England that ho
has hud enough of war and wants to
come home.
Then follows an almost tornado-like
correspondence in which officials, jwr
ents, congressmen and persons who
think they can hurry the processes of
diplomacy by their Influence become
sympathetic, tearful, importunate or
mandatory. The red tape of govern
mental business, however, unwinds
slowly, and finally the consul-general
in London or Ottawa, or somewhere
else or perhaps the American embas
sy makes representations to the for
eign government and the adventurer
is released and sent home.
1'ntll recently the Rritish govern
ment has been promptly releasing all
Americans under 21 on the request of
the United States government on the
ground that it is illegal for such a per
son to ctilitst in a foreign army with
out parent's consent. Recently the
Hritish government has shown a dis
position ot reduce the age limit to 18
when minors become of age in n mili
tary sense.
MANY TELEPHONE CALLS
N. E. Tel. and Tel. Co. Very Busy
C-jring Election
By far the busiest place in town on
(lection day and the days following
was the local telephone ollice. On
Tuesday evening beginning about 8.30
and continuing until after 12 o'clock,
the force handler about 600 extra calls
most of them being for the Manner of
fice, as the telephone olfieo had an
nounced that they had no returns.
From midnight until ti in the morning
when 75 calls Is regarded as unusual,
there were 278 received.
On Wednesday the biggest busi
ness was done. The rumor that
Hughes might not bo elected coming
just before noon made the number of
calls between noon and one o'clock
increase from three to six hundred.
The total for the day was 7,421. the
normal being about 6400. These
numbers would have been larger, but
many people, finding, the line busy,
did not call again. On the same day
the toll .calls were increased fifty per
cent. On Thursday the number was
again about normal.
Great credit must bo given to the
members of tho telephone force for
their elllcient work in handling such
an enormous amount of business. At
no time was the service other than
the best and Bennington should be
proud of being so well served at such
a time

RUSSIAN
FLEET
Heavily Bombard Black Sea Port
ofConstanza
FIGHTING NEAR TCHERNAVODA
Teutons and Slavs Still Battling for
Possession of Way Over
Danube
Petrograd, Nov. 11. The Russian
fleet bus come to the aid of the Slav
onic armies battling in Dobruja. The
Heet has heavily bombarded the Black
Sea port of Constanja doing great
damage, according to the olliclal re
port. Driving against the center of the
Russian line on the eastern front, Ger
man treops have gained possession of
Russian positions on a front of
about 2 1-2 miles. The attack, which
resulted in the capture of more than
3000 prisoners, took place in the dis
trict of Skrobowa, 12 miles northeast
of Baranovichi, north of the I'insk
marshes, and where only isolated
fighting has taken place lately. The
Russians, Berlin also says, lost 27
machine guns and 12 mine throwers.
The success of the Germans is ad
mitted by the Petrograd war office,
which announces that the Russians,
arter stubborn resistance against
seven onslaughts, were finally com
pelled to fall back to their second line
of trenches. Elsewhere on the east
ern front to the Crapathians there has
been little fighting, according to the
official communications.
In Dobrudja the advance of the
Russo-Rumanian forces southward
continues, and Petrograd records a
battle with Field Marshal von Mac
kensen's troops in the region of Tcher
navoda, abandoned recently by the
Rumanians. At Tchernavoda is the
bridge of railroad running between
Constanza and Bucharest, and it is lor
this bridge the Russians and Ruman
ians are fighting. Petrograd also an
nounces the occupation of several
towns between Hirsova and Tcherna
voda. Berlin says there have been
no important changes in Dobrudja.
On the Transylvania-Rumania
front Archduke Charles has assumed
the offensive and pushed back the Ru
manians. In the Pre deal sector stub
born fighting continues, with both the
AiiFtro-Cermans and the Rumanians
claiming progress. The Austrlans
have almost completely recovered the
ground lost in the Georgeny moun
tains on the 4th.
Several trench elements north of
the Somme, near Les Boeufs. and
Sailliscl, have been captured by the
French. Berlin states Franco-British
attacks between Gueudecourt and
Sallly were repulsed.
There has been much aerial fight
ing on tho western front. Berlin rec
ords the destruction of 17 entente air
planes, and Paris asserts that 10 Ger
man machines were brought down.
London admits that seven British air
craft failed to rtturn to their base
after fights in the air. In one of the
tights a squadron of 30 British air
planes and a German squadron of be
tween 30 and 40 were engaged.
WEEK OF PRAYER
Studies by Laymen at Y. M. C. A.
A. W. Varney Opens Series.
Next week is the annual week of
prayer for young men, promoted by
the Young Man's Christian Associa
tions throughout the United States.
It will be observed by tho local Y.
M. C. A. with meetings for men each
evening from Monday to Saturday,
inclusive, except Thursday evening,
from 8.30 to 11.30, at the Association
building
The meetings will form a series of
studies based on a new book "The
Meaning eif Prayer," by Harry Emer
fou Fosdick. This little volume came
out last year and nearly 100,000
copies have been sold.
The studies will be critical and con
structive "Is prayer merely the re
flex action of men's minds?" "Is pray
er an effective way of getting things
by beggins?" "What is really accom
plished in intercessory prayer?" "If
things are going to happen anyway ac
cording to fixed law, what is the use
in petitioning?" These are questions
which besiege men's minds, and they
will be dealt with constructively at
these meetings. The unanswered
questions of many an honest doubter
will be answered. There will be an
opportunity for discussion. .
Mr. Varney will discuss "The Na
turalness of Prayer," and "Prayer as
Communion with God." and he will be
followed subsequent evenings by other
leaders In thought.
All men are cordially invited to at
tend. Offerings will be taken toward the
remarkable work being counducted,
by the World's Committee of Young
Men's Christian Associations among
the millions of men under arms on
both sides in tho present Trf . .

SAYS HUGHES MADE MISTAKE
"Dry" Chairman Says His Silence on
Prohibition Was Fatal,
Indianapolis, Ind., Nov. 9. Oliver
W. Stewart, chairman ot the prohibi
tion national campaign committee, to
day issued a statement in which lie
said the prohibition vote would reach
350,000 and that had the republican
party and its nominee said anything
against the liquor traffic enough pro
hibitionists would have voted the re
publican ticket to have assured Mr.
Hughes' election in earlier returns,
Mr. Stewart said:
"Returns from our vote are slow in
coming iu, but we have heard enough
to justify us tn expecting the final
total of votes polled for Mr. Hanly,
the prohibition candidate for presi
dent, to reach 350,000. Mr. Chafiu, our
candidate four years ago, polled 208.
ooo votes.
"So close was the race between
Hughes and Wilson that the Increased
vote which Hanly received In several
states it' given to the loser would have
changed the result. Many progressive: s
who believe in prohibition turned to
Hanly rather than Hughes because of
the silence of the latter issue in which
they are interested."

Joy of Republicans Will be Long Re

Editor of the Banner: Permit me
to occupy a few columns of your
valuable space and add my thanks to
these of Dr. Lane and Attorney Mer
rill, who so touchingly expressed their
appreciation of the generous support
given them by their fellow citizens in
electing them, with brother Hughes,
to positions of responsibility In the
back row of Nigger Heaven. I should
be ungratful indeed to the dear people,
if I failed to acknowledge the kind re
ception and hilarious applause which
gieeted the modest efforts of your
humble servant as he bellowed thru
a megaphone on Tuesday night.
For fear no one else will do so, I
wish also to thank you Mr. Editor,
for the copious supply of election
news which you furnished at your
private expense, hot off the wire, and
which gave so much joy to a large
and anxious audience.
I know that you and I sense the
satisfaction that comes to one who
has striven successfully to make his
fellows supremely happy, even if it
last but a few hours, and which we
trust may come to us but once in a
life time.
The smiles and plaudits of the Re
publicans as we told them of the
enormous majorities for Hughes in
New York and Illinois cannot be
obliterated from our minds, even by
the later broadening grins of the
Democrats, who in fiendish glee are
accusing us of being stingy with our
bomb-shells.
With what delight did the people of
Bennington and vicinity listen to the
boom of those two shells, and even the
Democrates urged tis to send up Just
ono more
How we wish we had listened to
their still small voice, because now
their pitiful cry has become insistant
and we cannot longer resist their
pleading.
So, barring unforseen contingencies,
we will next Monday night send up
the third bomb and thus indicate that
it Is all over. Wilson is elected.
Long live Wilson; the country will
soon be in ruins. The trusts will now
be busted, and the busted must be
trusted. We cannot have any glorious
war with Mexico, but will have to
hang around home and eat meat three
time a day, and drink milk at three
cents per quart. Crowded soup houses
and savings banks on every corner;
Bread lines, and Plerce-Arrow spaces
everywhere occupied; Free trado
with prices of necessities soaring up
and dropping down; Protection and
everything going to the dogs and the
capitalists; A great influx of pauper
labor from Europe as soon as the war
closes, and every man of them a loyal
American citizen as soon as he sets
foot on our shores. These are only a
few of the inconveniences which we
will now have to enjoy until next
election time.
Who would have believed one little
bomb-shell could make so much dif
ferance. Anyhow, four years hence if I am
alive and you are alive and the Ele
phant and the Donkey are still kick
ing, we will get our heads and tales
together before touching off any fire
works, if we have to wait until after
inaugeration to moke sure who is who
in the White House.
In the meantime Bennington is go
ing to continue loyal to its govern
ment, local state and national. We
are again a united bunch and can pull
off our community stunts and boost
Benningt&n county whoever temporar
ily occupies the throne.
The next numbor on our program
will be Thanksgiving Turkey.
