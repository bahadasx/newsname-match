There is but one way out
of poverty for the generality
of mankind, and that is
downright hard work, econ
omy and self-denial. Young
man, draw off your coat, roll
up your sleeves and wade in.
This everlasting waiting'for
something to turn up—wait
ing to step into dead men's
shoes, will terminate your
career, as a mere groveling
dependent, subsisting and
only existing and filling
space without a real or single
purpose in life. Wake up!
Stir around and send the life
blood coursing through your
veins. Hold up your head,
clean your face, put on a
smile, and cast that woe
begone look in the rubbish
by the wayside, where it be
longs. Move forward, clear
the tracks, and the grandest
opportunities of life will
open up, which you want to
eeize with a tenacious grip,
and they will unfold to you
all the hidden treasures you
ever imagined or conceived.
Young man, this is no im
aginative drawing, a delusive
sketch, a fantasy, and if you
possess enough grit and
stamina you can make it a
picture true to life; thous
ands have done it, and you
have an equal footing today.
Few rich men owe their pos
sessions toaccident; few great
men owe their distinction to
luck and chance. Thus far
greater numbers have won
by perseverance, push and
pluck, diligence in business,
spending less than their earn
ings, surmounting obstacles,
overcoming difficulties, with
a will invincible.

A certain candidate, so it
is said, was making a speech
to a crowd of farmers, in
which he told his hearers
that he was born and reared
upon the farm. That as a
boy back in Kentucky, he
fed the horses and pigs,
drove a team of oxen, split
rails, cleared land, plowed
and hoed in the field, worked
in the garden and had work
ed in the harvest fields. In
closing he said: "Fellow
citizens, tell me if you please,
is there anything on the farm
that I cannot do?'' There
was profound silence, until a
small voice, emanating from
the rear of the house was
heard with the question:
'6au you lay an egg?" It
is said that the meeting ad
journed abruptly.—E x.
A hen is not supposed to
have much sense or tact, yet
every time she lays an egg
she cackles forth the fact. A
rooster has'nt got a lot of in
tellect to show, but none the
less most roosters have got
sense enough to crow. But
man, the greatest master
piece that nature could de
vise, will ofteu stop and hes
itate before he'll advertise.
