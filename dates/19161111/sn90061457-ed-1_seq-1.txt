ST. JOSEPH, MISSOURI, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1916
NUMBER 6
I AGAIN "13" IS A WINNER FOR WILSON
r
-fl
President Wilson and Vice-President Marshall will continue to be at the head of the
Greatest Nation on the face of the Earth. This matter was settled by the people of the United
States Tuesday.
On Thursday night, after two days and nights of tense suspense, the falling into line of
California with its thirteen electoral votes added to the four of North Dakota which had fallen
in line in the afternoon, carried the president over the line and gave him 269 electoral votes,
three more than was necessary for his election. This ended the tension, and the greatest vic
tory the people ever won in American politics was theirs.
And it is a people's victory not a Democratic victory in the true sense of the word but a victory of the people under
the auspices of the now great Democratic party. It was to the efforts and through the help of the loyal Republicans and
Progressives of the United States, who love their country and its institutions above all party, who made this great result
possible and gave to this nation Wilson and four more years of peace and plenty.
There were wild scenes In this city
when the result was known. At 11 p.
m. the Monroe club, with a brass band
and a fife and drum corps and with
tho members of that organization, aug
mented by a thousand cheering citi
zens carrying American ilags, paraded
tho streets shouting, singing and
cheering. The newspaper offices were
visited and given such a visit as their
political preference disclosed. The
famous Lincoln club was -visited and
a jollification meeting held under its
curred the entire state ticket would
have been elected.
The Gardner land bank and the
prohibitory amendments were de
feated. Prohibition was beaten by
pearly 100,000. The fate of the blind
amendment is yet in doubt.
A County Winning
And then there is the county ticket
which did not do so bad considering
the difficulties and troubles under
which it labored on account of some
of the dlssentlons which have been

darkened windows. The demonstra
tion lasted until the small hours of the
morning, but was but a feeble effort
to what tho real ratification will be
but It was glory enough for ono day
and night.
Reed Is Re-Elected
And Senator James A. Reed, Mis
souri's great junior senator, is again
1 re-elected. He had one of tho most
i wily and powerful opponents, but
despite the great odds ho camo
t through triumphant by a splendid ma
' jority. Tho people of Missouri realize
i hla great worth and they would not
t hear to it that he should be retired.
, Especially would they not allow him
to be retired by such an opponent as
Dickey, who relied entirely on his
money to pull blm through.
- State Ticket Elected
And the state ticket, with but one
single exception Is safely elected
Trom Gardner down. The exception Is
'John P, Gordon for Btate auditor, .wl
was defeated by Fred Hackmann by a
small plurality.
Gardner had a hard race he had all
sorts of Influences against him and
was up' against dissensions in his own
' party, due to local conditions, but
despite all of this he will bo inaug
urated governor of Missouri in Jan
uary, 1917. Ho made a great race un
der most discouraging and adverse
circumstances. The loss of Gordon is
deeply regretted, as bad It not oc-
to tho front for sometime. The loss of
three of the tickets is directly
chargeable to this condition, and 'it
would not be out of place for the
members of the Democratic organiza
tion to remember it when next elec
tion rolls round and a ticket is placed
In tho field. There Is moro vote win
ning in an ounce of good natured co
operation than there Is in a ton of
bickering. As It was Otto Thelsen
was beaten for sheriff by Ed Isaacson
by 1,036 votes; Ed M. Swartz for
representation in the First district by
Charles Du Bols by 35 votes, and
Oscar McDanlel by Lawrence Both,
well by 3,686. Tho official vote of the

PRESIDENT'S RUNNING MATE
Booher's Great Showing
If there ever has been a doubt of
the personal popularity and high
standing of Congressman Charles F.
Booher it was Bwept away in tho
great wave of popular commendation
which swept over the Fourth district
on Tuesday and returned Mr. Booher
to congress for the sixth time by a
plurality which nearly reached tho
four thousand mark. Congressman
Booher now enjoys the distinction of
being the only congressman elected in
this district for the sixth time. Tho
longest period of service ever hereto
fore enjoyed by a congressman from
this district was that of Col. James
Nelson Burnes who served four terms
and was re-elected for a fifth but died
before he assumed his seat for the
last term. The fact that Congressman
Booher has been elected six times dis
closes that his services are not only
satisfactory but appreciated.
The plurality which ho received
this time Is a remarkable one in the
fact that It disposes of the old cry
of tho other fellow who wants the
BOOHER ELECTED SIX TIMES IN SUCCESSION
