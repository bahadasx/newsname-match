273 VOTES
CLAIMED FOR WILSON
Unofficial Returns Place New Hampshire in the Dem
ocratic Column With About 70 Plurality
DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE
With the Acquisition of New Hampshire, President Wilson
Stands Able to Lose Seven Votes " From Calf ornia and
Still Have Enough to Elect Republican Campaign Man
agers Base Their Only Hope on Probability That the Un
official Returns Thus Far Announced May be Changed
by the Official Count McCormick Declares Talk of Re
publicans Trying to Contest the Election of Mr. Wilson
is All Moonshine.
With the statement of the- secretary
of state of New Hampshire that un
official returns gave President Wilson
a majority of about 70, the claim is
made that the president is now certain
of 278 electoral votes. Mr. Wilson is
leading Hughes in New Mexico, thus
there is a strong: probability that the
democratic nominee will have at least
27 votes in the electoral college.
Hughes is still leading: in Minnesota
with Wilson gradually cutting; down
his rival's margin.
West Virginia which was claimed as
doubtful until late last night, had gone
definitely for Hughes.
Unless the vote of California should
be divided, which seemed a possibil
ity, Mr. Wilson was assured of 273
votes in the electoral college, seven
more than a majority and Mr. Hughes
of 243. The president stood able to
lose seven votes from California and
still have enough to elect.
A conference of republican campaign
managers was called for noon today
to consider the election situation. La
ter, Republican Chairman Willcox
said, in a formal statement, that the
result still depended upon the-vote of
h few close states and that the re
turns thus far announced were in most
states unofficial and miiht be changed
by the official' count, for which re
publican officials wailed before accepting-the
result. - .
Democratic National Chairman
Vance McCormick declared talk of re
publicans trying to contest was all
moonshine.
ERRORS DISCOVERED IN
NEW HAMPSHIRE RETURNS
Figures Now Indicate That Wilson
Carrie State by About Seventy.
Concord, N. H., Nov. 10. Discovery
of errors today in official returns
further clouded ' the outcome of New
Hampshire's vote for presidential
electors.
Secretary of State Bean announced
In his final statement of the day that,
with five of tne 2t4 precincts missing,
the certified count was:
Hughes 48,422; Wilson 43,098.
A Hughes lead of 324.
He pointed out, however, that these
figures included the Hugnes vote in
two precincts, the clerks of which fail
ed to credit Wilson electors with any
votes In their certificates. In' each in
stance the clerk later admitted that an
error had been made. The clerk of
ward 2, Dover, said he should have re
ported 289 Wilson votes and the clerk
of war 2 Keene, said he had omitted
135 Wilson -votes inadvertently. Both
officials said they would correct their
reurns on substitute blanks forwarded
by the' secretary of state tomorrow.
The Ave precincts not accounted for
in the certified returns are shown by
press figures to have cast an aggre
gate vote of 293 for Hughes, and 263
for Wilson. Unofficially, the secretary
of state said, these figures indicated a
Wilson lead in the state of seventy
votes. The combined total of certified
and press reports was Hughes 43,715;
Wilson 43,75.
Official returns from two towns to
day changed the figures gathered by
newspapers, but the difference was
slight in each Instance. One change
added ten to the Wilson vote; anoth
er lessened it by four.
Preparations for the re-count de
manded by the republican leaders yes
terday, brought ballot boxes from
many places to the state capital today.
The ballotso were sealed in regulation
pasteboard boxes in many varieties of
containers. Wooden packing boxes,
lard tubs, a box that resembled an ice
chest, crates and other forms of re
ceptacles came In by express, by
freight and on trucks. All were
placed In a special vault, to be held
for the inspection which the law states
shall not begin until fifteea days after
the filing of notice.
The democratic state committee is
sued the following statement tonight:
"We accept aa approximately cor
rect the tabulations showing a plural
ity In this state of seventy for Wilson.
That Wilson has carried the state ad
mits of no doubt. No Inspection of
the ballots can show a material
change. If there is any change at all
it will be favorable to the president.
The democrats have not asked for
a recount and have made no charges
of fraud at any time. They have
merely taken steps to protect the in
terest of the president in New Hamp
shire In ease an emergency should
arise. No emergency is now antici
pated. The burden of proof la on the
republicans. The highest plurality
that we have claimed for the president
at any stage was 121."

DEUTSCHLAND READY
, FOR HOMEWARD TRIP
It is Believed She Will Sail Within
the Next 48 Hours.
New Lohndon, Conn., Nov. 10. The
Deutschland, the German merchant
submarine which arrived here on No
vember 1. is loaded and ready for her
dash homeward. The exact time of
her departure was a matter of con
jecture tonight but it was generally
believed she would sail within the next
forty-eight hours.
James L. McGovern, collector of cus
toms for the state, arrived here today
nd met Capt. Koenig and officers of
the Eastern Forwarding company. He
said-he did not know when the craft
would leave. The clearance papers it
is understood, have been prepared.
- The work of loading the cargo was
completed during the day. ' The car
go's value is said to be in the neigh
borhood of one and one-half million
dollars, consisting largely of prude
rubber, nickel, zinc and silver bars.
The value of the latter is declared to
be $250,000.
The engines and other machinery of
the submersible were tested today.
A sixty days' supply of provisions
was loaded tonight.
When the Deutschland leaves, it was
said, she will not take a pilot on
board. There were no indications of
the presence of warships of the allied
powers being outside the three mile
limit.
PRESENCE OF FOREIGN
WARSHIPS OFF. THE COAST
Strange Code Signals Have Been
Overheard Watching for Deutsch
land. Boston, Nov. 10. The presence of
foreign warships off the coast, pre
sumably watching for the departure
of the German merchant submarine
Deutschland from New London, Conn.,
was indicated tonight, by reports in
shipping circles of strange code sig
nals overhead. The nationality of the
supposed warships was not disclosed.
EARTH MOVEMENTS IN
CANAL WILL BE OVERCOME
Gen. Gcethals Says So in Annual Re
port to War Department.
' " Washington, Nov. ; , 10. Prediction
that earth movements in the Panama
erai vioeinais, governor or tne canal
zone, In his annual report made pub
lic today by the war department. This
will be accomplished, General Goo
thals says, "notwithstanding the ca
lamity howlers and despite the disast
rous predictions of the -know it alls.' "
Referring to the slides, the general
said he is moved to go into the sub
ject again only because of the many
false reports that have been publish
ed. "Such reports are false and there
is no foundation for them," he de
clares, "yet- they seem to have gained
credence probably because a -pending
treaty between the United States and
Nicaragua contemplates securing from
the latter all rights for building a ca
nal on its territory." '
Such reports,- General Goethals add
ed, serve to aid shipping companies to
take advantage of present conditions
to charter ships at excessive rates and
permit an increase in insurance rates.
He protests particularly against - a
widely published report made by Pro
fessor Benjamin Leroy Miller, of Le
high University, on his return-to the
United States after spending three or
four hours looking over the canal.
General Goethals says Professor Mil
ler's statements were "erroneous, un
warranted and unfair."
A GREAT DROP IN THE
PRICE OF HARD COAL
Wholesalers Say the Decrease in New
York Varies From $230 to $4 a Ton.
New York, Nov. 10. The tension in
the coal situation has eased in the
past few days and wholesale prices
have dropped several dollars a ton, ac
cording to statements by trade author
ities here today. Antharcite selling
recently at $12 to $12.50 a ton whole
sale may now be purchased for from
$8.50 to $10, coal men said.
Arthur F. Rice, president of the
Coal Merchants' Association, attri
buted the lower prices to the milder
weather and to the fact that the pub
lic had recovered from its recent
"panic" during which householders
filled their bins through a foar that
prices would rise still higher.
The recent high prices were due
principally .Mr. Rice asserted, to lab
or shortage, industrial factories work
ing overtime and a smaller mining of
coal from April to September.
FEAR CAR SHORTAGE MAY
CAUSE FREIGHT CONGESTION
Railway Officials Making an Investiga
tion of the iStuation.
New York. Nov. 10. Fear that the
car shortage may cause more serious
freight congestion at the eastern sea
board' led the executives of the lead
ing trunk lines of the east at a meet
ing here today to appoint a commit
tee of railway officials to make a
thorough investigation of the situation.
The committee also will consider the
question of an embargo.
The car shortage In the east, rail-,
road men declared, is far more seri
ous than it was last year and the
opinion was expressed that it might
become even more serious. The per
sonnel of the committee was not made
public but it was understood to in
clude the same men who made up the
Eastern Freight Accumulation Con
ference which dealt with -the situation
last year.

Value and Results in Advertising
With reference to the value of advertising, Frank B. White of the
Agricultural Publishers Association has this to say: I have yet to hear
of an advertiser who has persistently, Judiciously and intelligently ad
vertised for any considerable length of time, and has supported that ad
vertising In the proper conduct of his business in other directions, who
his not succeeded. Loss through advertising is largely due to inade
quate support, indifferent or useless extravagance. Your business like
your soil, must not be robbed. It is a law. of nature that where we
receive much, we must give something In return. . Your soil wiiTwear
out if you do not fertilize and properly care for it. Your business will
run down If you do not advertise and keep it in a healthy state of cul
tivation.' It is activity that causes growth and development; in fact, it
is activity that makes us strong. An active advertising campaign will
make your business healthy and strong.
Thiss a statement of facts which applies to all lines of business
and in th.s part of the state there is no medium which will bring such
results in an advertising campaign as The Bulletin.

SUMMARIZING ACTIVITIES
OF BERMAN SUBMARINES
For -Submission to President . Wilson
On His Return to Washington.
Washington, Nov. 10. A complete
summary of the situation growing out
of recent activities of German sub
marines is being prepared at the state
department for submission to Pres
ident Wilson on his return to Wash
ington Sunday.
While officials are not Inclined to
discuss the subject in its present
stage, .they admit informally that the
outlook is niore disturbing than it
has been at any time since the sink
ing of the channel steamer Sussex.
Official information still is incom
plete in all the fcases being investi
gated by the department, including
those of the British passenger steam
er Arabia and the British freighter
Marina, on which six Americans lost
their lives.
Reports from British sources have
saij that both ships were torpedoed
without warning. The American em.
bassy at Berlin was instructed last
week to ask the German foreign of
fice for its version of the sinking of
the Marina, The embassy has not
been heard from, but confidential ad
vices received here today from Ber
lin said the embassy had been in
foimed that the incident would be
thoroughly investigated as soon as
reports from submarines now cruis
ing had been received, but that the
German government had not chang
ed its submarine policy and did not
believe the ship had been attacked
without warning.
Aside from the specific cases about
which inquiry Is being made, dis
quiet has been caused here by the
general sweep submarine warfare has
taken recently. Officials fear that
the submarines are .operating on such
a scale and under such conditions as
may be impossible for them "to avoid
endangering Americans illegally.

FLURRY CREATED IN
THE WHEAT MARKET
By Rumor That a German Submarine
Had Sunk a Steamer in the Gulf of
Mexico.
Chicago Nov. 10. Rumors that a
German submarine had sunk a steam
er In- the Gulf of Mexico caused the
wheat market to have a sinking spell
late today after prices had touch
ed a new high record for the season.
The close was weak at 188 1-2188
3-4, December, and 192 1-2 May, with
the market as a whole 1 1-2 lower to a
liko advance as compared with yes
terday's finish. Corn gained 5-8
1 3-8; oats 3-85-8 and provisions
25100.
It was not until the last fifteen
minutes of the session that wheat
prices underwent a decided setback.
Profit-taking on the advance had
been unusually heavy during the pre
vious hour and appeared to have
about exhausted the available buying
power for the time being. The bears
seized the opportunity and pressed the
selling while the pit was disconcerted
by the prospect that shipments from
Gulf ports and from the Atlantic ea
board would perhaps be greatly cur
tailed by the supposed peril from sub
marines. In this connection more or
less uneasiness was aroused by no
tices that several eastern , railroads
have given notice of a temporary em
bargo on shipments of grain, al
though the reasons for the embargo
seemed to re exclusively to traffic
condittOM railroads.
