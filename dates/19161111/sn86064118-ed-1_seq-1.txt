8AME FELLOW,
And when a fellow feels a lltllo glum
Somewhat ritowsy llko a bum.
No money 'n his pockets and nono to

No where to go nnd havo no frlonds.
Ho Is a funny fellow to bo sure.
Somewhat llko an apple core.
Tho last thing from nl! tho rest
And still Is tho heart of tho, best.
No use tickling or saying olios
I no reuow wpni laugu wno is uroKe,

Especially It you havo any to lend.

Therefore ho has taken a rising pill

Ditched trains require much mend

properly restored to their former good

boys dormitory has been completely
miowiti'd and equipped with electric
lights, radiators htito been Installed
in eory room and through tho su
perintending of Mayor Meberry per
fect order Is maintained.
Realizing the effect good and whole

teach from bo iks hut v.iio havo also
had spcilil training In music mid the
