Danube. -
Sofia reports that Bulgarian artil

BORDER EXPERIENCES
(Correspondence Tampa Times)
On the Border Near Laredo, Texas,
Nov. 5.- While expecting almost any
thing to happen, the first real excite
ment that has occurred to the Florida
troops since coming out on the border
took , place Friday night near the
camp of Company H, when their seri-
ry discovered several Mexicans
smuggling garlic across the Rio
Grande into American territory. The
greasers when called upon to halt did
the opposite, ancf while the sentinel
fired a couple of shots in their direc
tion the garlic dealers only., threw
themselves into high gear, running off
and leaving their clothes and a couple
of, large bags of garlic which were
confiscated and later turned over to
the customs officials at Laredo. This
morning about 5 o'clock an outpost
of company H discovered a bunch of
destitute Mexicans who had just
crossed from the Mexican side having
been ferried across by some enterpris
ing greaser who the soldiers failed to
get. The Mexicans were not seen on
account of the darkness until they
were across the river and the man
who had brought them "over was half
vay across the river on his way back.
While several shots were fired in his
direction in an effort to capture the
industrious greaser, he only paddled
the harder and made gobd his escape.
There were fourteen m the party
taken,- ranging in ages from three
years old to unknown ages including
men, women and children. They
stated that they had been on the road
for eight days coming from the inte
rior of Mexico where they said the
people were starving to death and
that the reason they hadattempted
to slip across was because they were
penniless, and could not pay the toll
across the bridge, v They had eaten
nothing but parched corn on their
trip and were certainly a pitiful sight.
Company H fed the hungry Mexi
cans all they could eat and made them
as comfortable as possible while wait
ing for their transportation to the
custom house where they will no doubt
be turned back into their own coun
try as undesirables.
The attack which we supposed was
to come before election has o far
failed to materialize, and it is hoped
by the soldiers who are doing border
duty that the necessity of their re
maining here will soon come to an
end and that they will be able to re
turn home by ' Christmas or New
Year. .
It is thought that the Florida troops
will be returned to their main camp
at Laredo some day this week where
our stay will be indefinite so far as
we know now.
Capt. Chester Dishong of Company
F and Lieutenant Whidden of Com
pany K were made extremely happy
yesterday when their wives ; arrived
from Florida and will remain at La
redo as long as the two officers are
on duty here., .

A Good Attendance and Much Useful
Work Done at Friday Eve
ning's Meeting
. The Board of Trade had a very interesting-meeting
last night, there be
ing a greater attendance than at any
meeting for more than a year. Much
interest was manifested in the dis
cussion of the proposed amendment
which the state tax commission is ad
vocating to the tax commission law,
chapter 6500 of the acts of 1913, A
motion was adopted approving the
measure, or a similar one, and the
representatives to the legislature
from Marion county are requested to
use their influence toward the passage
of such a measure at the next session
of the legislature. .
The secretarystated that he had
-conferred with Mr. L. N. Green with
regard to the extension of time re
quested by the railroads for the erec
tion of the union passenger station,
and that he had been informed that
the railroads had asked an extension r
to. May 1st, 1917, for the completion
of the same. He stated further that
this was in accord with agreements
made between Ocala people and the
railroads at the time the railroads
agreed to have the depot erected on
the south side of the tracks. It being
the sense of the Marion County Board
of Trade that the city council of Ocala
had been handling this matter, it was
decided that the board should take no
action. s
Motion was adopted to have erected
a sign across Magnolia street from
the board of trade room to. the build
ing opposite with the name "Marion
County Board of Trade" printed on
same. - . ; v
Motion was adopted that the board
of trade should lend its assistance to
the civic committee of the Woman's
Club in gettingjip and promoting the
municipal Christmas tree.
Reference was made to the import
ance of having exhibit space reserved
at the Jacksonville fair and the
Tampa fair for our exhibits. No defi
nite action was taken regarding the
matter. .. ;
Some discussion of the Florida First
advertising was entered into. Several
suggestions were offered as to a good
method of advertising to follow up
this general advertising. It is very
likely that local ads. will be placed in
the newspapers in the more important
tourist towns of South Florida a lit
tle later on although no action was
taken at this meeting. '
