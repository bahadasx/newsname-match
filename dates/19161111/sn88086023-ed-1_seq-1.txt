THOUSANDS OF PHI
JOIN IN BIG DEMONS
cmting Ml VICTORY
The re-election of Woodrow Wllsun
was celebrated In a noisy and specta
cular manner lust night by several
thousand men, women and children.
A purade, bonfire, band, flreworka
and all kinds of noise-making Instru
ments figured in the demonstration
over the president's victory.
The celebration started at 7:30
with a parade which formed on Court
street and marched south on Main
to the old Happy Canyon grounds
where a huge bonfire had been pre
pared with oordwood and barrels of
tar.
Women and children as well aa
men took part in the parade and al
most everyone was armed with Ro
man candles and sparklers with which
they Illuminated the line of march.
The band led the way, playing patri
otic airs. There were many banners
In the parade, all of them Inscribed
appropriately.
One of them read, "The a. 0. P.
Sun Bank In The West." Another
read, "The People vs. Wall Street
Verdict for Plaintiff," another "A
President With Whiskers There Alnt
No Such Animal." another, "Tills la
The End of a Perfect Day," another
"President, Senate. House. We
Should Worry" and still another, "An
other Thing Thnt Helped The Gold
en Special." One banner showed a
man wearing a Wilson smile with the
Inscription, "A Satisfied Customer Is
ths Best Advertisement." Another
acclaimed "Four More Years of Wil
son and Prosperity." Still others
took digs at local republican 'cam
paigners. One read, "Chairman Curl
Predicts Eetc. The Doctors Have
Hopes." One democrat bore aloft a
banner reading, "35 Cent Wool. Where
Is Senator Purges?" and he was un
able fo find that prominent republi
can leader. Another bore the signi
ficant Inscription, "Where is The
Btaln On the Flng?"
One feature of the parade thnl
caused much amusement was the ap
pearance of two scrawny, little pigs,
commemorating the historic speech
made during the republican campaign
by Mrs. E. B. Hanly. After the pa
rade they were crated up and ex
pressed to the wealthy Medford lady
who told many audiences that she
tas forced to sell her own two little
pigs In order to buy a railroad ticket
to town during the Wilson ''hard
times."
Funeral Over F.lophant.
Soon after the arrival of the crowd
' at the bonfire, funeral obsequies were
held. over the G. O. P. elephant. Th
big figure of an elephant which has
stood on top of The Peoples Ware
house for years was put on aa ele
vated platform, feet uppermost. With
the band playing a funeral dlrg
Henry Taylor acted aa hlifh priest and
performed the loa sad rites. Above
the prostrate figure of tho elephant
was suspended a lantern with a flick
ering light in It As the dirge came
to an end the light burned out and
Marshall Spell solemnly announced
to the audience that the elephant was
dead.
The band played patriotic tunea
around the fire for a half hour and
firecrackers popped In a way thai
suggested a Fourth of July celebra
tion. When the bonfire began dying
down, the celebrutors, headed by the
band, serpentined up town, led by
B. J. Murphy. Kven after the band
had broken up. the paraders contin
ued. A delegation of Athena Wilson
ites, each armed with a tinhorn, ad
ded their noise to the demonstration.
Automobile horns honked and vied
with the yells and yips from leathel
lungs. One delegation marched to the

MAY NOT ENFORCE THE

Says District Attorney.
Though the "bone dry" prohibition
amendment undoubtedly carried at
the recent election, It will not become
a Part of the law until the secretary
of state has announced the official
result and the governor has Issued a
proclamation. And even then there Is
some doubt expressed as to whether It
will be enforced.
District Attorney Frederick Stet
wer this morning stated in an inter
view that, as he is now advised, he
I does not believe the amendment is
i enforcable because it is unconstitution
al nnd homiis nA npnnltv Is nrnvlried
In It.
The district attorney states that he
was advised by R. P. Hutton, secre
tary of the Anti-Saloon League of the
state, that such an amendment has
been held unconstitutional by the
United States supreme court. For
that reason Mr. Hutton told him, he
states, that he was not supporting the
(.measure, i .
At the present time, the district at
torney states that he will take no ac
tion. He anticipates that the attor
ney general will Issue an opinion soon
and that a test case will be taken in
to the courts.
Mr. Steiwer states -that he has not
yet looked up the records to deter
mine whether or not the courts have
upheld such laws. Inasmuch as the
present laws of Oregon permit per
sons to have liquor in their possession
he believes the courts will hold that
an amendment prohibiting the im
portation of liquor will be construed
as unconstitutional because Interfer
ing with Interstate commerce. Be
fore such an amendment can be con
stitutional it is his present opinion
that this state must, like Idaho, make
the possession of liquor a misdemea
nor. At any rate the amendment does
not provide any penalty for a viola
tion of its provisions so that it would
be hard to enforce until the legisla
ture meets and fixes a penalty.
Shipment! Are Ordered.
Notwithstanding these opinions
many local men last evening tele
graphed orders in to wholesale hous

gal allowance at once. The amend

LONDON, Nov. 11. The great bat
tle continues between the Ruseo-Rou-manians
and Mackenien for the pos
session of the Danube bridge at Cer
navoda. Bucharest, Petrograd and
Berlin dispatches said the battle was
the most Important at the present
stage of the war.
Petrograd claimed the capture of
Lunereav station, two miles west of
Cernavoda. Berlin did not deny the
claims. Military experts say Russian
success at that point would materi
ally change the Dobrudja front and
place the Germans at a great disad
vantage. Corpses Mark Retreat.
The Russians are reported strong
around Cernavoda and rushing artil
lery for the final smash. Petrograd
reported advancing Russians found
hundreds of corpses marking the path
of Mackenzen's retreat. There Is still
doubt concerning sharp fighting; at
Predeal. Both sides claimed the ad
vantage. Berlin admitted the Ron
manian and Transylvanlan armies
had started a strong offensive but
claimed all attacks were repulsed.
Cernavoda In on Fire.
ROME, Nov.'ll. Bucharest seat a
wireless message that Mackensen
was retreating from Cernavoda Posi
tions. A great fire is raging near
Cernavoda. It is believed the Gr,
mans fired the city before evacuat
ing. The Bulgarian population Is
fleeing toward the border.
