PRESIDENT'S VICTORY
BIGGEST IN HISTORY.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 10.
Secretary Tumulty tonight sent
the following message to Presi-
dent Wilson at Williamstown,
Mass.:
"Election returns conclusively
demonstrate that your victory at
the polls is clear and decisive.
You have carried two thirds of
the states of the Union. The four
years of your administration have
brought you approximately 2,206,-
614 more votes than when you
were first elected in 1912. This
is the greatest increase given to
an American president for a sec-
ond term since the Civil War,
and despite the character of op-
position, is the largest vote ever
received by a president from the
people of this country. You have
a popular plurality "of 403,326, ac-
cording to bulletin received from
the Associated Press."

NEW YORK, Nov. , 10. Worn out
by the tension of waiting for the re
turns from doubtful states which
would determine whether he had been
elected to the presidency, Charles E.
Hughes retired at 9 o'clock tonight.
He spent the day at his hotel except
for a two hour automobile ride"wl!h
his wife this afternoon. Mr. Hughes
has not yet conceded the election of
President Wilson and probably will
not do so until the vote of close states
bas been officially counted.
May Not Need Recount
George W. Perkins conferred this
afternoon with the candidate. He
stated that no definite decision had
been reached by party managers in
regard to demanding a recount in Cal
ifornia, New Mexico and North Dako
to. He intimated action probably
would be deferred until the official
count was completed, in the hope that
there might be an overturn of the
comparatively slender-Wilson plurali-j
ties.

here were deserted early . tonight.

(Special to The Review)
PHOENIX, Nov. 10. Th elec

is assured by latest returns re
ceived here. Navajo ccunty,
which had been claimed by the
Democrats by 130 votes, reported
a majority for Campbell of ever

left the local Denv cratic work

Beginning of the End
Loss by Hunt of Navajo, Pima and
Graham, the switch of Yarapai to the
I Campbell column by 40 votes, tbe as-
i "ance that Pinal and Coconino will
i go for the Republicans, together with
an increasing lead in Maricopa, seem
to assure the end of the Democratic
administration.
