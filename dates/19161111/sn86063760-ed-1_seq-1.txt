In spite of the weather the tent on
Agusta street was crowded last night
to the utmost. Thousands packed un
der the tent, hundreds stood on the
outside, autmobiles lined up line af
ter line, men and women stood and
listened until far into the night, as
one by one the- various pastors and
leaders made fitting remarks in ref
erence to the work done in the past
six weeks.
Dr. Davis of the Second 'resby
terian churgh, Dr. Hahn, of the Pen
dleton Street Baptist church, Rev.
Mr. McAuley, of the Associated Re
form Presbyterian church, Adjutant
Crook, of the Salvation Army, Rev.
Mr. Holler, of St. Paul Methodist
church, Dr. N. J. Holmes and others
among those who, with much feel
ing and sincerity, heartily endorsed
and thanked Mr. McLendon, Mr.
Pledger, and the other members of
the party, for the most gracious
meeting that has ever been held
hereabouts. Wherever you go for
miles around Greenville you will hear
echoes of this meeting, and some day
in eternity glad hands will be clasp
ed between loved ones and friends
brought together in Christ through
the wo derful preaching of the most
wo ul gospel on earth.
At the close of the meeting Mack
had "his choir" to sing, to the great
delight of the throng, and they sung
too. Long were the encores and many
the words of approval that flowed
from the lips of the thobsands in the
tent.
The Close.
Just before the close, the pans
were passed around for the collec
tions again. Many contributed dur
ing this last meeting, and the evan
gelist. leaves with contributions for
his personal self amounting to some
thing over one thousand dollars, all
of which was entirely a free will of
fering made by the poor, who had
the, gospel preached to them. It is
unanimously agreed that this was a
poor man's meeting. The three
churches which invited Mr. MeLen
don, are ariong the smaller churches
of Greenville. 'The tent was located
on the o..ter edge of the city, in
what is known as "West End," but
notwithstanding this, the city as a
whole, has never known such a meet
ing.
Mack stood in his chair, with his
knee upon the pulpit, raised his hand
kerchief in the air and said: "Get
out your handkerchiefs, I am going
to say Good-bye." He called on "his
choir" to join in the "Great Halle
luiah" chorus and at the sign all
handkerchiefs were waived in the air.
No more impressive sight has ever
been seen hereabouts than when
these thousands of people silently
waived a "White farewell" to the
man who had brought the gospel of
Jesus Christ to their hearts and
homes as never before.
Last night he closed in Greenville.
Tonight he begins at Clinton. He is
not afraid of work, and advised his
hearers last night not to fool them
selves by believing that- work would
hurt a ma'n. He promised to send
a sermon from time to time through
the Piedmont, and heartily thanked
the newspapers, and particularly th3
afternoon paper, for the hearty co
operation which had made possible
the success of the meeting.
Baxter McLendon has come and
gone, but foot -prints of the Saviour
'who died for. a lost world, will be
seen wherever you go in Greenville
-today, because Mack introduced him
to hundreds who never knew Him be
fore. Some times the wheels slip,
while the wheels whirl, but with a
sand box full, it soon starts again.
Mack has the sand and when the
track gets too greasy don't worry,
lie has the sand to come clean and
drive on.
Dr. Davis.
In the good providence of God it
has been my privilege and pleasure
to attend some of the greatest even
gelistic services there the United
States have afforded during my thir
ty-nine years in the ministry. I can
mnot take the time to descend into de
tails regarding these services, but
I wish to say that for practical re
sults this campaign which closes to
night is equal to, if not greater, in
some respects, than any of those to
which references has been made.
I have prayed or a revival of the
*ministerial and $cial piety in the
churches of Gree ville. Nothing can
take the place of the pulpit in any
Y GOODBY[ To
KUR M'L[NDON AND PAITY
to learn over again that nothing can
take the place of this divine means
of communicating the truth by word
of mou-h; and I thank Gof for send
ing Baxter McLendon here to fear
lessly speak the truth in its purity,
in its saving power when attended by
the Holy Spirit's influence. .I have
never heard any one preach like
Brother 'McLendon.
One of the blessings that this meet
ing has brought to us is that it has
given us an oportunity ,to diagnose
the Spiritual condition of Greenville.
We have been able to examine into
the spiritual condition ,of the. individ
ual in these after-services, and find
out what our people believe and when
they do not believe.
This meetin has brought an 's
pecial opportunity for liberty. We
have been given the liberty, the free
dom to speak to a brother about his
religion. It has taken away the
glamor about religion that makes a
man feel that it is too good for every
day use ani is only fit for the king
dom of heaven. Baxter McLenden
has preached a practical religion
that a man can live by day by day.
The songs, too, have been a bless
ing, God bless the man who loves
::Ong. God bless Brother McLendon
and also Brother Pledger. who has
led us these weeks in songs of praise
to God. I believe these songs will be
sung in Greenville as long as these
heads are above the sod.
Mr. McAuley, A. R. P. Pastor.
When I heard that Da C r McLen
don was coming here to hold a meet
ing, I did not .put my nose on my
own back track (as he has so fre
quently in the last six weeks told us
to do), but I put my nose on his back
track. First, I found that he had
North Carolina blood in his veins, and
I said "He's all right." But I went
further, and I found that his grand
father was a member of the A. R. P.
church, and I knew he was all right.
Well, after my investigations you
saw me fall, with heart and soul in
to this campaign. I have no apology
to offer for taking part in this cam
paign, and I want to say here that I
think if there is any apology to be
made it ought to be made by the man
who stood with hands off. (Loud
applause). I have been taught to
recognize the gospel truth wherever
preached, and I believe in "Tentiani
ty" just as much as I do in-"Christ
ianity." (Applause). Men and women,
- I have asked God to give me Christ
ianity. When a man comes into my
realm and preaches the gospel of
Christ as this man preaches it I
unite my efforts with his at once to
bring about the salvation of souls.
If the Methodist church ever becomes
tired of Baxter- McLendon I want
to say that I know something like
10 A. R. P. pulpits that will welcome
him with open arms.
.During this meeting I have been
impressed with Mr. McLendon's
fearlessness and loyalty. He has
preached as we have never heard
God's word preached before. He has
denounced sin everywhere, and por
trayed God's wrath in a manner to
make men fear Him and love Him as
never before, and has made us love
the man, whos brought the message.
God bless Brother McLendon and
Brother Pledger and all other mem
bers'of the party. I am glad'to say
tonight that I am a better man today
than I was six weeks ago.
Dr. Hahn, Pendleton St. Baptist
Pastor.
We are saying good-by tonight,
and while I feel intensely the pain
of separation, at the same time it is
for my heart a triumphart occasign,
and I am very far from the spirit
of depression except for the thought
that I shall no longer have the op
portunity of attending these meet
ings. One by one have made the ac
quaintance of this party-Brother
Marshall, Mr. Howell, Mr. Loudy,
Miss Hill, who has been in my home
and who has left a gleam there that
will not depart when she goes away.
Then Brother Pledger, who has con
ducted the singing during these ser
vices. He is, in my judgment, one
of the two master conductors of re
ligious song that this country has
produced. He is a man of great
earnestness and a devout soul. I have
made the acquaintance of his culti
vated, delicate and refined wife, and
I bear in my heart a sense of her
happy charm and beautiful devotion.
We have all met "Rena (applause),

days and nights of anguish when she

would some day answer her prayer

night she must be one of the happiest
women on this planet.
During these last six -weeks we
have all suffered more or less from
the stabs of Baxter McLendon. There
are few of us who can not show a
stab or a bruise. Hey has not only
skinned 'us and bruised us, but he
has atomized us.
When I first met this man I was
disappointed, because he was a bit
too finely built. 1'had imagined- a
man of squat build, heaviness of jowl.
I observed him leaning against a tent
pole. I noted the long, lithe, grace
ful form and I said, "This is a leop
ard in human skin, an animal of the
cat kind." And when I saw him in
action on the platform I had no cause
to change my opinion. He is :a crea
ture of botled up intensity. He is
not afraid of anybody, in fact if he'
has a fault, it is the other way. .I
can imagine Baxter McLendon as a
dangerous man when in sin. With
his hair-trigger disposition I can un
derstand how he shot that man that
night in Bennettsville. When he re
sisted the spirit of God, in my imag
ination I see a dark angel take him
in his arms and dash him down, down
all the precipices of despair and say
you will lie there and be bored
trough and through by the undy
ng worm, you will be stung 'through
ith all the agony and remorse that
an be borne by man; and when God
s through with you you will come
p and stand 'as a mighty man of
od before the men and women who
ay, there is no hope for us, we have
een flattened under the roller of
ocial contempt; that when these
hall emerge they shall say, "if such
aman so fixed, so intense in evil,
can be brought back to God then
here is hope for me.
Tonight I am personally thankful
o God for Baxter McLendon. He
has opened wider my soul; he has
elped to make me more useful to
hrist. Tonight, after years of ex
ectation, I wish to say, I have seen
the evangelistic meeting for which I
ave longed and of which I have
reamed.
I have a personal word to say to
ome cultured people do not like your
hetoric, but I want td say right here
you, Mr. McLendon. It may be that
that you have not offended my - ear
very much, though, deplorable as the
fact may be, you have used a lot of
slang. Brother McLendon gives the
enter of the idea so that you can
hear it smack. He has thrilled me
through and through. I thank God
for a man who can look a man who
can preach and never -quail, a man
who can preach the gospel of Christ
without fear, and with an eye single
to the glory of God. I thank God
for a man whom we can love, an-i
admire and emulate.
Mr. McLendon in his closing re
marks urged his converts to redeem
the time. Don't throw away this
