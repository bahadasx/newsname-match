HEAVY
FUNDS TO MOVE
Member Banks Ask 92,000,000 Dally
of Federal Reserve Bank In
Minneapolis.
Minneapolis, Minn., Nov. 11.—Mem
ber banks of the Minneapolis federal
reserve bank have made a dally de
mand averaging $2,000,000 on the
government depository to aid In the
crop movement in the Ninth district
during the last two weeks. All indi
cations are that the total aid given
by the bank here to the farmers will
reach last year's total despite the
smaller crop this year owing to the
Increase in the cost of handling the
harvest.
The demands of the member banks
are filled by federal reserve notes,
mostly In $10 and $20 denominations.
A fresh consignment of $1,600,000
notes was received by the bank from
Washington yesterday. In order to
avoid creating a demand for the new
currency the new notes will be mixed
with the old notes which the bank
had left from last year's issue at crop
moving time.
GOEThALS TO

Action Preliminary to Re

Canal Zone.
Washington, Nov. 11—Major Geo.
W. Goethals, governor of the Panama
Canal zone will be retired from the
army on his own application, dating
from November 16 next. An army or
der today shows that Wilson approv
ed his application after 40 years' serv
ice. The order of retirement affects
only Goethals' military status and
does not operate to relieve him from
duty as governor of the canal zone,
but it is preliminary to his retirement
as such. He probably will be suc
ceeded by lieutenant Colonel Chester
Harding of the engineer corps now
acting governor.
DEMAND
SHU. AT HER
Absolutely no Information
Gleaned at Docks as to
Sailing.
New London. Conn., Nov. 11.—The
German undet-sea merchantman,
Deutschland, ready to proceed to sea
tor her return to Germany, still was
tied up at the state pier under the
shelter of the steamer Wlllehad, to
day. There were no signs of an im
mediate departure. No information
was obtainable as to the probable
time of sailing.
Those who tried to get a word with
Captain Koenig of the Deutschland,
Captain Hinsch of the Wlllehad and
Captain Hilken of the Eastern For
warding company, had no success.
Koenig has a choice of three courses
to reach the Atlantic ocean. One
would be through the Race at Long
Island sound and either of two which
would put his craft into the waters
near Martha's vineyard.
VTILISTAS ARE FOUND
IN PERSHING'S CAMP
Harbor No Peeling Against Ameri
cans, However, And Are Not
Placed In Stockade.
Field Headquarters, American
Punitive Expedition. Mexico, Nov. 11.
—'Followers of Francisco Villa have
been discovered in headquarters camp.
Thus far, none has been molested
nor placed In the stockade with the
score captured during the southward
drive of the punitive expedition. They
go about the camp openly and even
receive American gold, at the rate of
about a dollar a day, which is wealth
for a peon.
These Vlllistas, however, harbor no
evil designs against the American
troops. Neither do they talk about
their affiliations with the bandit lead
er. For they now are Paclflcos and
declare that half of the poor people
of the southern republic would do
just, as they are doing, work in a
desultory fashion for the army from
the north, it given an opportunity.
But few of the laborers stay long In
camp. Their fear of Villa Is too great.
The 'threat Villa has made, to kill
every man and woman who turns a
hand for the "Invaders," strikes a chili
to their hearts.

said:
"The war is won today. It is mere- I

ENGLISH SHOPS MUST

Government Takes Drastic Steps as
Part of Program to Control Busi
ness In Interest of War.
The chief object aimed at is econ
omy of heating and lighting, which
of course means economy of coal. One
of the great assets of Great Britain
during the war is its revenue from
the exportation of coal, and more
over its allies need all they can get.
Like every other war measure, how
ever, this act excites opposition and
creates complications, although the
people as a whole will accept it cheer
fully as they have other inconveni
ences.
The small shop keepers who live
at their place of business are the ones
who find most objection. One ground
of criticism is that the public houses
are still to be opened until half past
nine. "Why should men and women
be allowed to gather in drinking
places and buy beer, if they cannot
loaf. In a cigar store and buy cigars,
and gossip with the clerk?" is one
of the questions asked. Places where
meals are served may repain open,
but only for the purpose of giving
meals. They cannot sell cigars, nor
can they sell, candy or food to be
taken off the premises, since the shop
keepers dealing In the same commodi
ties are forbidden to sell. Nor can
the night hawks who have carts In
the streets for dispensing coffee snd
lunches to late workers, according to
some constructions of the law, sell
cakes to be taken away.
Some of the complications concern
places of amusement "The theaters
and music halls must not sell cigars
and confectionery after S o'eloek If
we cannot,'.' say the small shopkeep
ers. "That would be class legisla
tion. and unfair oompetlttQa." flmtk

St. Faul, Nov. ll.—The discovery
