FLOWER SHOW DECilsEfl SUCCESS
Visitors Lavish Praise on Excellence of the Exhibition
FLOWER SHOW TO CONTINUE OPEN OVER SUNDAY
•
1
witness it that the exhibition sur
passed i* 1 beauty, volumn and ex
cellence and such past undertaking.
! The ladies of the Civic League and
others who . lent their assistance to
^e perfecting of the h lower Show
ma y reflect with great pride upon
Today marks the close of the 191G
Flower Show and it is the opinion of
all who were fortunate enough to
their creation. It was splendid, and
its charms of beauty, splendor and
uplifting influence were but mir
rowed characterstics of the splen
dor ' charm and influence of its fair
promoters.
\ The realization of the w'orth and
e ^^ ec ^ s ^e 1916 Flower Show
Are brought to many only after it is
Qfipast history. No doubt, the praise
for the Show today on the lips of all
who attended will cause regrets of
those who missed the exhibition. And
every citizen could have profited by
attending.
The admission prize, § a handsome
floral painting in oil, by Mr. C. S.
Gray, a talented and well-known ar
tist in this city, was won by Miss
Meta Shannon. This beautiful souve
nir of a beautiful event will un
doubtedly be a treasured possession
of its owner.
To describe in detail or in general
the appearance of the Flower Show
and to hope to do justice to it would
demand a more gifted pen than this
reporter possesses. To paint in mere
words the limitless loveliness of
those flower faces and their parent
stems is a task too delicate. They are
there to be viewed by you and, see
ing them, their radiations of scintil
lating beauty and fragrance will im
press you far more than words.
Because of repeated demands, the
ladies of the Flower Show have decid
ed to keep the exhibition open
for one more day. So tonight and
tomorrow the chance to see this
rare collection is still open to all
flower lovers. The Review has been
requested to advise owners of plants
now on exhibition that perfect care
and attention will be given their
specimens and that a safe return
will be made.

names of winners of prize ribbons
and the flower or plant with which
the ribbon was won:
