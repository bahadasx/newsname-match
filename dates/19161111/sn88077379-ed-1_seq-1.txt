Organized Labor Supported Wilson
Ohio and California Union Men Were Particularly Active and Successful. Four Years More of
Wilson Will Take the Yoke Off of the Working Classes. James M. Cox,
Labor's Co-worker, Elected Governor of Ohio
Organized labor throughout the coun
try won a glorious victory when they
re-elected Woodrosv Wilson. The un
ion men of two States, Ohio and Cal
ifornia, were particularly active and suc
cessful. Four more years of Wilson will take
the political yoke off of the laboring
classes, and the election in 1020 will
find a more intelligent and independent
electorate.
To show how the people resented
Hughes associating with the money
kings of this country, the Enquirer
prints the following telegram from New
York:
New York. Republicans, recalling the
trip of Charles E. Hughes to the Pacific
Coast at the beginning of the campaign,
said tonight that it probably cost him
the Kl electoral votes of California and
the Presidency.
Mr. Hughes reached California be
fore the Republican primary, at a time
when Hiram Johnson was in a bitter
contest for nomination as United States
Senator. Mr. Hughes, it was recalled,
not only did not mention Johnson's
name in his speeches, but was under
stood to have declined to meet Johnson
publicly before the primaries were decided.
It also was recalled that there was crit
icism because Hughes was said to have
accepted entertainment at thc.hands of
persons formerly identified with the so
calltd "Southern Pacific" "organization,
against which Johnson had waged a suc
cessful fight. In addition to this, he
attended a luncheon which was served
by nonunion waiters during a waiters'
strike in San Francisco, probably the
strongest labor union city in the United
States.
Since that scries of incidents it was
said that the friends of Johnson had
been lukewarm in their support of
Hughes, an assertion that seems to be
borne out by the returns.
OHIO TjAUOR IIAI'I'V.
Organized labor in Ohio is particular
ly rejoiced over the election of James
M. Cox as Governor, which means that
not only will all the progressive labor
legislation now on the statute books
be protected, but that others will be
passed.
The Workmen's Compensation and
Mothers' Pension acts are safe from
attacks for the next two j ears.
With all the State officers Democratic,
as well as the House and Senate, it looks
as if organized labor will get a square
deal for the next two jears.
The re-election of Senator Atlcc
Pomcrcnc was particularly pleasing to
organized labor as he had supported
every labor bill before Congress.
The wet interests sunnoited him for
the simple reason that he had supported
them when they were in danger.
Things never looked brighter for or
ganized labor in Ohio than it does to
day, and we predict that the Workmen's
Compensation will pay $5,000 death ben
efits before the term of James M. Cox
is over.

Politicians discussed ihe possible ef
fect Thursday of the election of James
M. Cox as governor upon Cincinnati's
gas and electric rates and street car fare
issues.
Each of the issues is or in the future
will come before the State public utilities
commission.
Tim r-lifimm in mlmitiistratinn mav re
sult in a change in the membership of
the commission.
There has recently developed in Cin
cinnati a feeling of opposition to the
commission, as at present constituted,
because it is believed in some circles that
the valuations it fixed on the electric
lighting property of the Union Gas and
Electric Company and upon the prop
erty of the Cincinnati Traction Company
were too high.
An upheaval in the commission might
result in appointment of one with dif
ferent ideas as to rates and valuations,
it was pointed out by some who have
been leading in the fight for lower rates.
