GREAT MEDICAL
SCHOOL GIFTOF
ROCKEFELLER
University of Chicago
to Have $10,000,000

RUSH COLLEGE
WILL DISSOLVE
New Institution Will Rank
with Those in Vienna
and Berlin
The establishment of a new medical
department for the University of Chi?
cago, vhich will involve an investment
of }10,000,0u0, was last night an?
nouneed by Dr. Abrnham Flexner, sec?
retary of the General Fdiicatioti Board,
from the funds of which organization*
in cooperation with the Rockefcller
Foundation, 12,069,99*) has necn appro
priated for the project. In addition to
the medical'sehool the plan calls for
the founding of an adequately equipped
and linanced post-graduate school of
a standing equal to tho.-e of Berlin
and Vicntia.
To carry out the plan, in addition
to the pift of the General Kducation
Board and the Rockefeller Foundation,
the University of Chicago will set
aside at least $_,n00,000 and will give
a site valued at J'iOO.OOO and a further
sum of $Sf399f90*9 will be raised by the
university.
The Presbyterian Hospital of Chi?
cago, valued at $;i,00n,000, will be taken
over by the university for the post
graduatc work, thus brir.ging the total
initial investment up to about $10,
000,000.
Rush To Be Abandoned
Rush Medical College, one of the
oldf-st in-titutions of its kind in thc
Middle Wfr-t, vhich has had an ar
rangeineiit with the university whereby
it might be used in connection with
the rnedical department, will be aban?
doned and its faculty dissohed. The
entire teac.hinj* staff of the new school,
clii.ical as well as laboratory, will be
organized on the full time basis and
professors and assistants will hold
their positions on condition that they
become salaried university officials,
giving up their practices completely.
The only other medical schools in
the country employing the full-time
sys'em of teaching are those at Johns
Hopkins, IJaltimore, and Washington
University, St. I.ouis, both of which
rfletitotiom have received gifts of over
a million dollars from the General Kd?
ucation Board.
The proposed medical school will be
erected on the Midwav Plaisance and
will form a part of thc university
plant. I.aboratorv building* will be
provided for the instruction of stu?
dents in the first and second vears, and
a university hospital, with laboratories
and an out-patient department, will be
included in the plan. A large research
laboratory will be built in connection
with thr- Presbyterian Hospital. It is
estimated that it will be two vears be?
fore the school will be ready to receive
stu'dtnts.
400 To Be in First Clasa
It is probable that the same entrance
requircnients now demanded at Johns
Hopkins a college decree. with spe?
cial work in chemistrv, phvsiology and
biologv will be established for the
new school. The tirst class will proba- I
bly number not more than 400 carefully
selected students, and the faculty. none
of whom have been vet chosen. will in
clude the foremost medical authorities
in the cmintrv. each with three or four
asMstants.
The new medical school roes to the j
I'tnversitv of Chicago because it has I
no such a.nartment well established at
present. , j

lished with the hope that it will pro- j
ride opportunities tor research and spe- ;
cial work for Amencan phvsicians. ;

The new gift brings the total ,
amount presented bv John I>. Rocke

to just a httle less than S.Vi.OOO.OOO,
and it raises the total of the appro
priations of the (ieneral Kducation

Atl-intic City, N'ov. 10. A policy of
."conservative action" will soon re
place that of "watchful wait.ng" as a
means of srttling the difference? be?
tween the I'nited States i.nd Mexico.
The Mexican-American Joint Com?
mission, which for nearly eleven
wriks has oeen temporizing and hair
spiitting in a dispirited discussion of
the border problem, renumed its con
ferences to-day, after an election week
recess. The American commissioners
lost no time in impressing Carranza'*
representatives with their belief that
the delibentions had reached the point
where conccssions by the de facto gov?
ernment. ?er<. necessary to harmony
between the United States and Mexico.
An American official attached to the
commission declared that "the end of
the discussion seems to be in sight."
He predicted that, now that the elec?
tion had cle;;red the air, the I'nited
States 4vould "take some conservative
action hefoi" long."
The situation to-night 4vas admitted
to be more serious than at any time
since the Columbus raid. The **-'**x':
cans admitted that Villa has captured
I'arral, but denied that Torreon had
fallen to him. The Americans. how?
ever, had advices jtatini: that the lat?
ter town, described as the military
key of Northern Mexico, 4vns in the
possession of Villistas.
Admit Diaz Strength
The Mexicans admitted that the
Lagaliata forces of General Felix Diaz
had occupied Kincon Antonio, in
Southern Oaxaca. Rincon Antonio Ifl
the most important Mexican railroad
junctiin south of Mexico City. the
Diaz forces in possession there can
stop all supplies tfl the capital city
over the l'an-Amerioan and Tehuante
per railroads.
The American commissioners also
had advices that practically the entire
population had evacuated Chihuahua
( ity, feaiing an attaek by \ illa. Car?
ranza otVuials were said to have fled
across th ? border, carrying with them
all available currency and other valu
able?. Millions of dollars in l nited
States currency, the Americans have
learned. have been brought across the
bor.ler for safety by officials and rep?
resentatives of the de facto govern?
ment. . , .
The Mexicans remain unmoved in
face of the-e reports. They deny them
without offering anything in substan
tiation of their denlals. They pro
nounce Villa "practicclly powerless
am! announce that a large force of
CarraaaiflUn is preparing to give bat?
tle to the bardit on "the plains of
Kscalon." This location is described
bv American military experts as open
countrv. which is good for a battle. |f
both sides are willing. but no place
for Villa to fight."
The bandit, they say. never would
consent to matching arms with Lar
ranza's troops in such a regUtn.
lt can be reliablv stated that the re
moval of Pershing's forces now is not
being MBatdored by the American com?
missioners. The matter of their seri?

Williamstown, Mass., Nov. 10.--In his
] first speeches since Klection Day Pres?
ident Wilson to-night urged that poli
; tics and political prejudices be forgot
| ten and the welfare of the nation be
' considered.
The President came here to stand a*.
godfather to his granddaughter,
! Kleanor Axsor Sayre. He made two
speeches. one ta several hundred Will*
? Uuai College students and residents of
Williamstown, and the other to resi
detit-i of PittefieM, North Adams and
other Herkshire towns, who paraded
1 with torches and a band to the Francs
H. Sayre home.
"I came a-vay to eseape making
i speeches," saio the President. "I came
purely on a private erratul, and so you
will tXCBM me if I do not discuss
'' public affairs. Now that the campaign
is over it ir to the interest of the
: great country which has given us lib?
erty and freedom that we forget our
I difference*. forget our contrary pur?
pose* and work in unity of spirit for
! a better and a greater nation."
A great chcef grtcted the closing
' sentence, and some >?ne shouted:
, "Three cheer** for Baby t.yre!"
The President smiled broadly and
waved his acknowledgment of the trib?
ute to Baby Sa>re as hc stepped inaide.
(heered by Student*
Between three thousand and four
thousand persons heard his second
speech. Searchlights from an auto
? mobile stationed on a hill opposite
' played on the President'.s features,
while the whole lawn was illuminated
'? by red tire torches and burning brooms,
symbolizing the passing of Republican
"Clean sweep."
Called to the front porch of the resi?
dence of his son-in-law, Francis B.
Sayre, earlier in the evening, the
President plcaded that eolitics be put
aside, "now that the campaign is over,"
and that the people of the country now
address themselves with a unanimity
of spirit to thc problems at hand.
His brief talk followed the christen
; ing of his granddaughter, Kleanor
Axson Savre, and tea at the residence
ef Henry A. Gartield. president of Will?
iams College and a UM of President
iMBea A. Qafteld. When President
: Wilson stepped out on the porch Sam
! uel P. Blagden. chairman of thc Town
Council. wclcomed him to the town.
President Gartield then extended a
welcome in behalf of Williams College.
He intimated that although the politi
cal views of some may have been at
variance with hi* they were greeting
' him as a "friend. our Chief and our
neighbor."
"We trunt that this will not be the '
last time you will visit the college,"
he aaid. "I remember that once you
'told me that your expenence as the
head of a college had made it easier
to meet some of the problems as Chief
Magistrat? of the land."
Saya Fightert* Should Forget
"Your president has told you that I
spoke of politics in college." said Mr.
Wilson. "He knows, as I know. that
there are subtleties of politics in col?
lege life as well as in public life. for ?
politics. after all. is merclv a means
of getting what we want. But now the
difference* should be forgotten. I don't

of a man who had a dream that he was

Ideals of Progressives
in West Beat Hughes,
Says William Allen White
Republican Action Was Considered a Repetition of 1912
and Independent Voters Would Not Follow
Leaders, Kansas Editor Declares
By WILLIAM ALLEN WHITE
* [By Telegraph to The Tribune.]
Emporia, Kan., Nov. 10.?Speaking broadly, as one must speak in
generaiizutions, and consciously allowing for unimportant exceptions,
Hughes could not cross the Mississippi and the Ohio and Wilson couid not
po East.
The South and the West, which seem to have little in common, have
olected a President and have chosen a Congress. New York and New
England are a subject people. New York and New England believe rather
-letinitely certain things. But their beliefs are of little importance in the
actual conduct of the country; for the South and the West, even though
they have little in common, have that little strongly in mind. And that
little is distrust of the property-minded politieal leadership of the East
and the North.
Twice has the nation seen that leadership revealed at ita worst; four
years ago, when, with a criminal greed for dominance thinly veiled, they
Ihrottled the liberal majority in the Republican party at Chicago by tac
?ics, and then when in June of this year the same cold-blcoded, crafty
group sat unmoved by a nation's appeal for genuinely progressive leader?
ship and a progressive platform. The country asked for Roosevelt, and
they gave it Hughes?Hughes and Fairbanks.
A convention that was a sort of compromise between a directors' meet?
ing and a memorial service, nominating two estimable mutes who went
sighing through America over the vanity of human frailty, who could
conduct nothing but a funeral. And the gorgeously funny part of the
.4pectacle was that the moumers, big and little, presumed to talk Ameri?
canism, and when they talked about it they crossed themselves and raised
their eyes heavenward as if Americanism were some sort of sacred formula.
Americanism is red-blooded. Americanism is fundamentally demo?
cratic. Americanism is robust, sturdy, hilarious, rampant. It is something
that holds "the glory and freshness of a dream."
Tears Shed Over Americanism
But barring the lusty whacks from the Colonel's busy battleaxe, we
had in this campaign for Americanism nothing but tears and vain regreta.

WISS RANKIN LAYS
CONGRESS PLANS
First Woman to Win House
Seat Will Make Social
Welfare Her Work
IBy THeiraph te Tlie Tribune 1
Missoula, Mont., Nov. 10. Miss
Jeannette Rankin, whose election to
Congress is assured, views the ap
proach of that new career with the
utmost equanimity. That is a habit
she has. In the days when she ac
companied her father on trips to his
lumber camps the gusto with which
the occasional meals she cooked were
received by the crews of fifty or sixty
men aroused not the slightest per
ceptible conceit.
She took it as a matter of course
that she could cook and that men
should like her cooking. Although a
glow of inner pride warms her voice
in -praking af her election, she seems
to take it rather as a matter of course.
Politicians give her no qualms.
A Veteran in the Game
"No," she said. "I'm not nervou-i
about going to Congress. I've been
working politicians and for politieal
matters so long that I feel I'm a vet?
eran in the game.
"Of course 111 make speeehes. I've
been making them for the last eight
years for suffrage and for prohibition
and for myself. Social welfare legisla?
tion is my chief concern. and will be.
I've had something to do with a chil
dren's home society in Washington
she was the official home-tinder for
liorneless children in Seattle), and I
know the needs of the youngsters.
That work gave me an insight into
the needs of babies, oldcr children
and young adults. and it is for them I
shall work especially."
Miss Rankin is thirty-five years old,
makes her own haU and gowns. is
wrapped up ir. children, has made
stump r-peedies all over the I'nited
States and in New Zealand, and has
her own opinions on the tariff. She
was born on a ranch near Missoula,
and since she was graduated from the

cohol When State Goes Dry
[Br TWefreph lo Th* Tribune.)
Detroit, Nov. 10. The breweriea of
Michigan may ?ome day be turning out

the dilemma of owner? of the liity-two
breweries in the state.
Knter Henry Ford. The auto man
suggests that the breweries simply con?
tinue to manufacture alcohol, the only
difference being that the alcohol would
be coniumed by motor cars rather than
by the ownern of motor car?. On Sat?

WILSON LEADS IN
NEW HAMPSHIRE
Recount of Vote Likely To
Be Demanded by
Republicans
(From ? 8t_<T <i>rTMjxiPd?M of Tb* Trlbun* )
Concord, N. EL, Nov. 10.- Following
a message from National Chairman
Willcox late to-night, the Republican
state committee announeed that it
was prepared to demand a recount of
: the 90,000 Lallots of this state in the
hope of ovcrturning the present nar
row Democratic lead.
All the preliminary steps have been
taken, and there is nothing that can
be done further at present, save to ac- '
cumulate evidence of irregulanties. j
I Some of thia evidence is already in ;
1 hand, Chairman George H. Moses, of
the advisory board, declared to-night.
Mr. Moscs insisted the present Demo?
cratic lead was only 54 votes, although
the official information is that it is 70. :
Should it develop that four votes
upset the election of Mr. Wilson a i
recount will be sought.
No I.aw for Recount
The confidence of the Democnit.*
that it is all over is lllustrated by the
fact that Senator Hollis, after tele- .
graphing President Wilson yesterday,'
left for a vacation in Nova Scotia.
. Robert Jackson, his law partner, and
counsel to the Democratic State Corn- ,
mittee, declared there eould' be no
change in the result.
"The laws of New Hampshire," he
said, "do not provnJe for u recount of
the vote for Presidential electors. The
Secretary of State opena the ballot
boxes and shows the ballots to the
Governor and council, who then cer- j
tify the election of the electon and
other ofhcials' cboiccs. This has al?
ways been a perfunctory perform-',
ance and will be so this year, despite
the closeness, for there is no metlioJ |
provided for attacking the certitication
m the courta."
Clerka Correct Krrors
Ai it now itands, the state's vote
will be: Wilson, 43,785; Hughei. 43,71.,.
This includes the vote in f.ve pre?
cincts, the returns of which have never
been received officially by the Secre?
tary of State, but which have betn
telephoned m to both headquarters, in .
all probability correctly. lt also in?
cludes the corrected ligures on two
precincta, where the clerks failed to
certify any Wilion vote at all.
For a while to-day it was thou.ht
that the result of tbeie two errors
would be to give the itate to Hugnee,
but the clerka in both precincta, ?h. l
reached on the long distance telephone,
announeed their willingneis to certify
the correct figures, and the Secretary
of State announeed he would accep. ,
the correctioni.
In one of the precincts, Ward 2 of
Dover, Stratford County, clerk Jo!..*.
W. Hogan failed to mention 2?9 Wu
son votea, while in Keene W.rd, of
Cheihire County, clerk Adolph W.
Prenler failed to certify 135 Wuso.i
votei.

save by telephoned results, are Kyc.

NO CONTESTS

IS DISCOVERED
Two States May Give

of Twent'y-two
HE SHOWS GAIN
IN MINNESOTA
Campaign Heads Seek
Excuse in Result in
California
More complete returns from Naj*
Hampshire and Minnesota strength
ened President Wilson's hold on a
majority of electoral votes yester?
day.
Besides the 272 vote? that seemed
assured to him on the basis of al?
most complete returns frorn Cali?
fornia, New Mexico and North Da
kota, he *j*ained I lead of seventy
ballots iti N'ew Hampshire, and cut
down Charles K. Hughes's lead in
Minnesota from 700 votes on Thurs
day's count to 54.'"! votes on returns
up to early this mornins*.
The oixteen electoral votes of theie
two states are still in the doubtful col?
umn. If the President finallv gets
them he will have 288 votes in the Klec
toral College, twenty-two more than
enough to elect.
Refuse to Coneede FlectioB
("aar'es K. Hughes and the Republi?
can campaign managers refuse, hovv
evei, to coneede the rcelection of the
President until the official count of
1 votea in California. New Mexico. North
Dakota and ,\ew Hampshire is record
j ed. That may take about s week or ten
days.
It is unlikely, in the face of returns
at this time, that recount* will be de
rronded. All Mr. Hughes. William R.
Willcox, chairman ol" tfM Republican
National Committee, and the candi?
date'.* other politieal advisers desire,
?pparently, is conlirmation of the un
official returns. Th.-re is a difference
of opinion among the R.-publican man?
agers as to recounts, but Mr. Hughe?'?
counsel to wait until after the official
wanva*s will undoubtedlv prevail. The
President's lead in (alifornia, New
Mexico and North Dakota is so great
now that recounts probably will be re?
garded as futile.
The vote on the late?t available re?
turns in the flve atate* wh?re the race
was close is as follows:
California, with cighteen diatneta
out of 6,87i- niissing, gave Wilson a
plurality of 3,28**. Ni-w Mexico, with
forty-?cven out of 638 districts mi??
jrtg, gave Wilson a plurality of -.'.UM
North Dakota, with thirty-three out of
1,859 districts missing, gave Wilson a
plurality of 1,56". New Hampshire.
with five out of -94 districts missing.
gave the Pr?sident a lead of Tt. while
Minnesota, still faithfjl to Hughes,
with thirty-six out of ?',146 dintrirti
missing, gave him a plurality of Ml
votes.
8,00*9 Votea Would Change
The record closeness of the contest
is best indicated by the fact that onlv
8,000 votes properly distributed would
make a difference of 37 electoral vote*.
It is upon this fact that the Republican
managers are basing their hope of a r*
versal of present appearancea by thfl
official canvasi.
If the Republican managers Inaist
upon the official returns before taking
any action toward recount proceedinga
or conceding the election of President
Wilson, it may be ten day? or several
weeks before the election i? defmltely
decided.
It is also exceedingly probable thfl*.
Mr. Hughes's present total of 243 ?ure
electoral votes may be increased not
only by Minnesota'a 12 vot>>? and New
Hampshire'* 4 the latter depending
entirely upon an official count but
also by a flplit in California'* 13 votea.
If Wilson's plurality in California re
maini about 3,000, the electoral vota i?f
the utate almost certainly will be aplit,
Without North Dakota or New Mexico,
as well a* New Hampshire. howevflr, ha
would have to get 7 of Callforaia'a 13
to make the nece?aary 264!.
And there are other poaflibllitiefl
which befog thfl lituation and ?eeming
ly justify the delay of the Republieani
in conctding the election. Kaniai
passed a ?tate law aince the 1912 fllec
tion requiring voter* to vote for the
electors in a biock instead of a* indi?
vidual* if they *o chose. That gives a
remote chance of contestine the law
as unconstitutional and posaibly havinf
the ten Kansas \ 0U? invalidated.
