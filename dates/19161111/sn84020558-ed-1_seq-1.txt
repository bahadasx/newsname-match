JOINT COMMISSION
S TIRRED B Y REPOR TS
OF VILLA SUCCESSES
(By Republican A. P. Leased Wire)
ATLANTIC CITY, N. J, Nov. 10. Confirmation of reports of the in
creased strength of various reactionary movements in Mexico served to off
set today the apparent determination of the representatives on the Mexican
American joint commission to effect an early adjustment of the problems the
two governments are facing. Until official reports reveal the truth of stories
of Villa's successes in the north and the progress made by the other reaction
aries in the south, there was a probability that an agreement would not be
reached before next week.
Reports received by the Americans from official sources and others re
ceived by the Mexicans from their government, dealing with the activities of
Villa, were studied at the conference today. The result of the comparison of
the reports was to disclose that General Carranza is now conducting a de
fensive campaign against Villa, with a battle at Escalon imminent, instead of
prosecuting a campaign against him.
From the south come reports, accepted as reliable that Felix Diaz's
forces are in possession of Rincon Antonio, a station on the Tehuantepec
railway, which extends from Salina Cruz on the Pacific to Puerto Mexico,
on the Gulf of Mexico. Diaz was reported in the state of Chiapas. It was
believed that the men in command of the Diaz forces that took Rincon An
tonio are Canuto Reyes and Ysaba Robles, formerly active in the support
of Villa.
The capture of Jiminez, Santa Rosalia and Parral, in the state of Chi
huahua, was confirmed. General Murgia is in command of the Carranza
forces now opposing Villa's southward movement at Escalon. Under him is
General Maycotte, who was forced southward from Jiminez. When the Car
ranza troops moved southward they tore up the railroad tracks behind them,
delaying their pursuit by Villa, wnose total force is variously estimated at
from a few hundred to 7,000.
Reports reaching the commissioners indicated that Chihuahua City is in
no immediate danger of falling into Villa's hands, although it is known that
General Trevino, the Carranza commander, needs ammunition.
Galleqo Station Burned
EL Paso, Nov. u. 'Reports
received by government agents
l-fte state that General Queved. anil
his bandits burned the station at Gal
lego and tied to the hills. The report
received here was that the telt graph
and railroad lines were cut but as the
Mexican Central passenger train ar
rived tcnight and telegrams aie being
received from Chihuahua City, the
railroad and telegraph has probably
been repaired by the troops lrom

A report of a raid by Villa bandits
in the vicinity of Aldijna, northeast
of Chihuahua City, was also received
here hy federal asents late today. The
report says seventy bandits looted and
burned the Aklama station on the
Kansas City, Mexico and Orient rail
road. There are no troops stationed
there.

the Mexican members of the Ameri

joint meeting of the American Acad

guests of honor. The speakers were

Mexican commissioners.
Mr. Bonillas laid much emphasis on
"the work of pacification now going on
under the Carranza government," as a
guarantee that the six years' civil war
is subsiding, and Mr. Pani declared

understood Mexico, because they had
no means of learning the truth.
, "It is not the purpose of the revolu

merely to place the Mexican on a basis
of equality with the foreigners before
the law."

NEW YORK, Nov. 10. With returns
missing tonight from only one con
gressional district in the United States,
the republicans and democrats each
had elected 215 representatives. The
vote in New Mexico, which is still in
doubt, probably will determine which
party is to have a plurality of one over
the other. The present member from
New Mexico is a republican.
The balance of power in the next
house will be held by four men, one a
progressive- protectionist. Louisiana,
one an independent from Massachu
setts, one a progressive from Minneso
ta and, the other a socialist from New
York. Their action apparently will de
termine the choice of a speaker as well
as the fate of legislation which is sup
ported or opposed on purely party
lines.
In addition to the hope of electing a
eongressman-at-large from New Mex
ico, the democrats had one grain of
comfort tonight. It was that an offi
cial count may disclose that Thomas J.
Scully had been reelected from the 3rd
New Jersey district. They contend the
chances were that Scully had been the
victor by a few votes over Rdbert Car
son, his republican opponent, to whom
the election previously had been con

"Despite the decentive suffrage ap

states were:
"First The sending out to the vot
ing states of the west, of the Hughes

The very idea enraged the women of
the west and it undoubtedly cost the
republican campaign thousands ' of
votes in each of the western states.
"Second Th slogan 'Wilson has
kept us out of war.' used in derision

nearby towns to congratulate him on
his re-election, President Wilson said;
"I want to say now that the cam
paign is over, we must think of only
one thing, and that is not of parties,
but of the intent of the great country
we all love. Let us forget all our
differences and unite for common ser.
vice. Only in that way can we work
for the great nation that h.ts given us
liberty and peace."
The president's second speech of
the day here was delivered before a
crowd of men from North Adams,
Pitt "field wnd o'her towns, W,o came
here by aiuunioMle. trolley and rail
road trains and marched to the home
of Francis B. Sayre, the president's
son-in-law, where Mr. Wilson is stay
ing. The delegation surrounded Mr.
Sayre's home and cheered until the
president appeared on the porch.
A fife and drum corps played pa
triotic airs. The majority of the peo
ple belonged to the North Adams
Wilson and Marshall club. Automobile
searchlights were thrown en the porch
and brought out the president in bold
relief. He smiled broadly.
"We are here to congratulate you
on your re-election," said Wm. F.
Grenier. president of the North Adams
Wilson and Marshall club, in intro
ducing the president.
Mr. Wilson, after thanking the
crowd fur "this penerous outpouring"
said he had come to Williamstown to

This is the greatest increase given
to an American president for a second
term since the civil war. Your vote
last Tuesday was 2.060.708 more than
ever previously recorded for a demo

ever received by a president from the
people of this county 952,955 more

10. The re-election
of President Wilson is viewed by the
Weekly Nation as an event favorable
to peace end to the cause, of state
liberty, and the paper thinks that his
election offers hopes of an earlier
end to the war agony than any nation
enduring it can yet foresee. William
Henry Massingham. the editor, in a
special note referring to President
Wilson says:
"The resources of the European
statesmanship are not so rich, nor
are its personalities so inspiring that
It can readily dispense with an acute,

The election of Tom Campbell as
governor of Arizona is apparently as
sured by the latest returns, received
in the office of The Republican from
non-partisan sources, and tabulated
here. Navajo county, which had been
claimed by the democrats by 130
votes, reported a majority for Camp
bell of over one hundred votes. This
news apparently left local democratic
workers in some pain, for the high
pitched yell of "Fraud" rent the nignt
air.
Loss by Hunt of Navajo, Pima and
Graham, the switch of Yavapai to the
Campbell column by 40 votes, the as
surance that Pinal and Coconino
would go for the republican, together
with an increasing lead in Maricopa,
seem to insure the end of the demo
cratic administration. Maricopa's ma.
jority for Campbell, according to tha
very latest figures now stands at 3,494
which is some 1,100 more than the
most pessisimistic democrat allowed
him.
For a time, the chaps with the busy
little pencils figured Baughn haH
beaten Ross for the supreme court,
but later returns from Yuma Mohave
and Cochise left the Pinal jurist
somewhat short of his hoped for ma
jority. In compiling its returns, The Re
publican used the figures of its news
paper correspondents in Pinal. Mo
have, Cochise, Gila, Santa Cruz, Na
vajo, Yavapai, Pima and Coconino
counties. In the others, the figures of
the next most reliable nature were
used. Graham, Greenlee. Yuma and
Apache were reported with but few
missing precincts, and the totals of
the bunch, gave campbell a majority
of 318 votes too close for comfort,
but enough to elect him if it isn't
overturned.
Undoubtedly, there will be a number
of calls for recount, and the opinion
prevailing here is that such a pro
ceeding would not injure the chances
of the aspirant against those of the
incumbent.
Along with the election of a repub
lican governor Tom Maddock, chair
man of the republican central com
mittee claims the state senate' has
been sweetened hy the addition of a
number of republican legislators, but
complete returns on the next legis
lature will r.ot Le available until to

standing and the most sympathetic
to ourselves. I think that most men
and women here who take more than
casual interest in American politics
read the newr, of Mr. Hughes' earlier
success with sinking hearts."
The New Statesman regards it as
better for the entente allies to have
to do with a president whose mind
they know and who is unlikely to
raise serious difficulties concerning
the British blockade.
"Moreover," it adds. "Wilson is the
more likely to be interested person
ally in the promotion of an anglo
American entente on the creation of
which after the war so many im
portant things will depend," ,
