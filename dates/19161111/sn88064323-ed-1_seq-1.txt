LITTLE KNOWN
FOREST PRODUCTS
WIDELY USED,
In addition to the ordinary uses
ot wood with which we are fami
liar, mankind is dependent upon
the forest for a variety of products
whose appearance does not indi
cate their origin, say members of
the Forest Service. Numerous as
these products are, and as exten
sive as is their use at the
present time, science is constantly
learning new constituents which
enter into the make up of wood
and is finding new uses to which
these constituents and those al
ready known can be put. Powder
for munitions or blasting, disin
fectauts for protection against
contagious diseases, and artificial
silk for clothing are among the
products obtained in whole or in
part wood.
Charcoal, as everyone knows, is
essential for the manufacture of
black powder. All of the acetone
used as a solvent in making nitro
cellulose powders is derived from
acetic acid, a product of hardwood
distillation. Great Britain, it is
said, is dependent upon the United
States for acetone used in making
cordite. Black walnut is a stand,
ard for gonstocks, and has been
so much in demand for the past
two years that our supply of this
valuable wood has been considéra
bly reduced and other woods, no
tably birch, are being substituted.
From Europe comes the complaint
that there is a shortage of willow
for making wooden legs.
Pure wood alcohol is the only
substance which can be converted
commercially into formaldehyde,
which is universally used for dis
infection against such contagious
diseases as smallpox, scarlet fever,
and tuberculosis. The experts at
the Forest Products Laboratory
have conducted extensive experi
ments on the production of grain
or ethyl alcohol from wood and
have been successful in experi
mental work in raising the yield
and lowering the cost of produc
tion. If this process can be put
on a commercial basis, the forest
ers say, it will result in putting
the millions of tons of coniferous
sawdust and other material which
is now wasted every year to a
profitable use.
By converting cellulose, one of
the elements of wood, into a gela
tinous material, known as viscose,
a wide field is opened up for the
utilization of wood waste,- and a
new line of products, varying all
the way from sausage casings to
tapestry, is added to the already
lengthly list. Many of the so
called "silk" socks, neckties and
fancy braids now on the market
contain artificial silk made from
wood.
About nine tenths of all the pa
per which we use is made from
wood. Besides the detailed inves
tigations of the methods of mak
ing newsprint paper, and of the
production of paper from woods
hitherto unused for that purpose,
which have been conducted, kraft
paper, which compares favorably
with the best on the market, has
been produced experimentally at
the Forest Products Laboratory
from longleaf pine mill.waste
This kraft paper is brown in color
and is very much stronger than or
dinary papers. It is used for a
variety of purposes, and, cut into
strips, is spun or twisted into
thread which is then woven into
onion and coffee bags, matting,
suitcases and wall covering, simi
iar to burlap, and furniture close
ly resembling that made from
reeds, as well as other articles of
common nse.
Within the past year the Forest
Products Laboratory has, by co
operating with manufacturers, sue
ceeded in getting a dye made
from mill waste ot osage orange
put on the market as a substitute
for fustic, which wé impart from
Jamaica and Tehuantepec.
These are only a few examples
of the various lines of work car
ried on at the Forest Products La
boratory, say the men in charge.
Other activities, ranging all the
way from the study of decay m
wood to that of the resistance of
wood to fire, are in progress, and
new discoveries are constantly be
iug made. Incidentally, the For
est Products Laboratory, at Madi
son, Wisconson, was the first of
its kind in the world and is proba
bly still the best equipped. With
the possible exception of Germany,
no other country has done as much
as the United tttates symtematic
ally to investigate the possibili
ties of its forest resources.

SWEEP THE BOARD
AT STATE FAIR,
Take Twenty One Prizes and
Two National Cups. Will
Bring Blue Ribbon Herd
to New Orleans.
Making practically a clean
sweep with his wonderful herd of
Duroc Jersey swine at the State
Fair at Shreveport, Evan McCall,
of Evan Hall Stock Farm just
above Donaldsonville, captured
twenty one trophies and two sil
ver cups and put his heretofore
successful Texas rivals iu incon
spicuous places iu the premium
lists. Mr. McCall won nine firsts,
seven seconds, three thirds, one
fifth and one sixth, the National
Cup and the American Cup, and,
on top of it all, took the Louisiana
Futurity for the best litter of
Four, a new classic for Louisiana
swine.
McCall's Diirocs expect to re
peat their victories at the National
Farm and Live Stock Show to be
held in New' Orleans November II
to 19, for the Louisiana champion
swine breeder who has attained
national celibrity within the short
space of two years, will bring his
champions down to New Orleans
to meet all comers.
The management of the Show
anticipate one of the most success
ful events of its kind in the South
and have put up cash prizes
amounting to §25,000 for the best
products of the farm and pasture.

HIGH PRICED PAPER,
White news print paper is
memory—practically unobtainable
now— wé must submit to some
shade of the browns or yellows
Since the beginning of this year
prices in this country have soared
til! they have trebled, or very
nearly. The government stated
an inquiry some months ago into
the cause of conditions and the
reasons for the high prices. This
commission has recently reported
that there is no reason for pre
vailing prices. The supply of raw
materials seems to be ample and
the mills are working fall 24 hour
time.
And still there seems to be a
reason for the prevailing high
prices.
The paper mills of the United
States and Canada were erected to
supply the demands of home con
sumption. The European war has
forced South and Central Ameri
cas to seek a supply of paper, to
meet their necessities, in the
United States. To take care of
these additional orders of the
tropics bas crowded the mills of
the northern counties a bit beyond
their capacity. A raise of price
makes consumers conserve their
orders and practice each econo
mies and will limit consumption
to the capacities of the mills.
The mill owners must have an
excuse for the advanced price.
Therefore, they lay it to the high
price of chemicals, when the mills
themselves are making the chem
icals they use.
Instead of building more paper
mills—which might be forced into
idleness when the war will be over
—the price is arbitrarily forced
upwards. This is hardly a worry
ot the paper maker—or at least it
provides a compensation for bis
worries. It is, his hay making
season." He is making more pa
per per hour than he ever made
before, working 24 hoars per day,
and getting his own treble price
for an inferior product. If he can
hold conditions as they are till the
"cruel war is over", without the
establishment, of many new mills,
he will not be forced to fight "a
ruinous competition" through the
years to come.
Now Japan comes to the front
with a proposition to sell "white"
newspaper in this country at a
price lower than those now obtain
ing. Japan proposes to do this, it
is claimed, notwithstrnding the
tact that she buys her logs in
Canada, converts them into paper
in Japan and now proposes to on
derbid American paper men in
their own markets.

When this factory was tust

it as a means of keeping himself
in employment when tfie big mill
with which lie was engaged would
shut down for repairs oi
of orders. This arrangement sav
ed him the necessity of leaving
his home and family, in dull
times, to seek employment e!s<

and his factory grew in importance
he was forced to give up the idea
of working for others. Not only
did his factory demand ail of his
time but the necessities ot his
growing volume of business forced
the empolyment of assistants at
