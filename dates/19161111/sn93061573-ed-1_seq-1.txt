CLAYTON. NEW MEXICO. SATI HOW. NOVEMBER 11, M5.
BY ELECTORAL
PRESIDENTIAL
Telegraphic dispatches from New
York slate definitely that Woodrow
vVilsmi was elected president of the
I'nited States when California swung
definitely into the Democratic col
umns early today. "The only states
where the result remained in ques
tion today were Minnesota and New
Hampshire, with sixteen electoral
sotes. WWilsw. has carried New
.Mexico. vllughes is leading in Miim
nesota. The result will not be known
in New Hampshire until the official
count is completed. West Virginia
which was classed as doubtful un
til last night, has pone definitely
for Hughes by about 2,000.
l.'nless the verte in California is
divided, which now seems a pos
sibility, Wilson is assured 272 votes
in the electoral college, six more
than a majority.
if Hughes carried both Minnesota
with twelve votes and New Hamp
shire with four, he would have only
209, seven less than enough to elect
The result in Minnesota may be
determined by the ballots of the
2,138 National Ouardsiuen now on
the Mexican border, which will not
be counted until the state canvass
ing board meets next Tuesday. He
turns received early today in the
stale gave Hughes a lead of less than
800, and the troops' votes may can
cel that.
Wilson leads in New Hampshire
by 239. '
California "complete,- except for
thirty-five precinctsgave Wilson
a plurality of 3,100 The tension of
the most dramatic situation in the
political history of tho United
States was broken as tho Associat
ed Press flashed the news that Re
publican State Chairman Rowell of
California bad conceeded the state
to Wilson. Frantic appeals to ex
pedite returns had been sent to state
leaders hour after hour from the
national headquarters of botli part
ies in New York. Telegrams were re
inforced by telephone calls across
the continent. It had been apparent
since Wednesday that California

hotel whero he made his headquart

number. "And I was born on Fri

LOAH BOARD TO
MEET IN AMARILLO. TEX
A Letter From Secretary Heuuests
Farmers To Appear And Pre
sent Data; Immediate
Action I'riied.
In order that the Federal Farm
Loan Hoard, which is the active
management of the recently passed
liural Credits Hill, may learn , tho
needs- and conditions of tho farmers
of the Panhandle country, which
includes Union county, a meeting
of the board has been arranged ot
Amarillo, Texas on November 21st,
in the Federal building.
Mr. Flaunigan, secretary of tho
board, in a letter to C. O. Dunn, re
quests that the farmers 'of Union
county send a delegation to appear
be fere the hoard and present their
need fur farm loans, data con
cerning money rates and credit as
all'ected by long and short timo loans
and any other information tho board
may require or tho farmers wish
to hring to its attention.
At this meeting the full worKing
of the Rural Credits hill will bo ox
plained to those interested by mem
bers of tho Hoard.
While any ;;n,i ..ii l.umers aud
business men of this community mar
attend the meeting, it is bcst. Unit
each community send a representa
tive who is well posted and can
stato the facts and needs of bis
community tersly and forcefully:
In this way much time can bo sav
ed. All, however, who can, are in
vited to attend the meeting as spec
tator?. Those who expect to bo ques
tioned, or the representatives se
lected by each community should
forward their names hunjediately
to C. O. Dunn, Clayton, N. M., who
will certify such names to the board
Only such as aro certified can ap
pear beforo tho board.
This is the first step toward' the
actual benefit of the Rural Crodhs
Act to the local farmers and im
mediate action should bo taken by
ail interested. Not only tho farm
erj should appear before tho board
but tho buiness men of tho com
munity should also bo present.
Ll'JAVS CARTOONS FEATURE OF
LOCAL CAMPAIGN
One of tho features of tho local
campaign, and one that caused
much favorablo comment on both
sides, were the political cartoons
drawn by Jake Lujan and posted
conspiciously in the windows about -town.
Jake has a good Idea of
"timliness", or 'news value', as it is
technially stated, and a broad
sense of humor combined with no
little skill with pen and pencil. His
cartoons caused no hard feelings and
were undoubtedly of assistance to
the Democratio party. uTrienda of
Lujan who is a Clayton boy, are wg
ing hyn to continue in the work
for which he shows such aptitude.
