Paris. Nov. 11. The Petit Journal
says Wilson's re-election Is satisfac
tory for two reasons: that for four
years the American foreign policy will
be free from all electoral considera
tion, since the constitution forbids
Wilson seeking a third term. Second,
that the result puts new life Into
American neutrality, saying evidently
an ImmeriHe majority has pronounced
against war. The paper adds that
other millions voted for Hughes be
cause he demanded even a firmer de
fense of American rights.
