The Next Move.
Keep Your Eye on Mexico and Study
the Plans of the Plunderbund.
While it was kept iiiu' t cover,
the real issue in the Campaign
just closed was Mexico. Ami
since both Wilson and Hughes
icpreseiit ti e exploiters, ther
could be no real quarrel between
them. Yet many people were
very much concerned.
Every citizen should Inform
himself on the Mexican situation.
Those people want nothing more
than George Washington ami his
follower! wanted when they re
belled against the tyranny of
England. Tiny want liberty.
Now that tile election is over
the Interventionists will got very
busy, Press report! from ti c bor

the trail of those horrors load up
to jrour respectable patriots ii

would not rappOTt a policy by
which Mexicans in El Paso are
made to contribute political reve

had been admitted to the eo :ti

authorities, and whose CgndUtt

Mexicans, (some twenty I am

WHO PAYS Tin: FREIGHT?
Mr. Worker, you have read a
great deal about tho high cost of
living. Yet what do you really
know about it- except that it Is
Retting mighty expensive to live.
You try furmi. ?, una ends fail to
meet. Many of you Quit farming
and try day labor, only to find
that you have not improved mat
ters any. Year after year th"
politicians and their organs iho t
ubout prosperity, while you and
your family are drifting toward
the poor bouse.
Do you know that the capital
ist politicians and their organs
never teil you the truth about
these things? It is their job to
keep you on a blind trail. Ono of
the chief cause of the hiih coHt
ol' li log is the ever increased cost
of no. eminent.
What wo. .hi you say if a Unit
ed States marshal came to your
door und told you that next year
you musl tod up 81B0 to support
the national government? That
is tiie average cost of govern
ment for every family of five in
this co intry.
Now, (.out Imagine that you
can escape yo ir snare of this tax
because you have nothing to pay
taxes oil. Vo .r rulers ore too
smart to send an officer to yo
and demand t,.is tribute. They
put a tax oa what you vat. drink
ana wear, ami v. ben you buy ,vou

of th" rotten ol d party politi
cians? With the exception of the cam
paigns or lh!G and 1'.K)0 we
have had the tariff as the 'para

also had tariff, but th" "para-

anti-imperialism.
Roth free silver and anti-imperialism
sirved their purpose and
have been put in cold Storage
But the tariff is always with us
lx'cause its fakery is less under

have .liven us what they called
"tariff for protection." The last
dose we got was und' r the Taft

In either cis it is an indirect

and 1 can't Se that it mok snny

During ita? Cleveland adminis

THE PROOF.
The first thing a 'free born
Americaa citizen" wants when his
grand-pa ideas are jolted, is the
proof. And then he wont believe
it if he can help It.
For years the Socialists hate
been trying to pound it into tho
lends ol the toilers that the Id
tere get the greater portion of
Wh'it they produce, tt.it they
eau't see it and insist on keeping
the idlers iu coutiol of govern-
tent.
Let's see if we now have the
yos.ti.c proof. The automobile
business is like any other manu
facturing business that employes
aiueh labor. Henry Ford is a pe
culiar capitalist. Ue uppeais to
te no hog.
Frd .a in the automobile man
ufacturing business and sold bis
aaaehinea at about the same price
ss other makers. Tbred years
ago he discovered titat bis prof
its for one year were ten million
dollars and that he only bad ten
Bullion dollars invested in the
automobile pi nit.
HoJ'd decided that he was get
ting too big a share of the pro
ducts and concluded to divide
with the men wro did the work.
So he more than doubled their
uy. The poorest pa d worker
was given live dollars for eight
tears work, and others get nioie.
illi Of the shrewd bue.uess men
preu etc J Lat.kruptcy lor Ford.
Hut at the end of the year his
roiits were still ten mi'l.nn.
With the increased pay the men
eie so much better able to care
tor themselves' and fam.lies that
work was a pleasure to them
tid they produced more.
Ford then reduced the price of
bis cars, and anuounced that he
WMild share profits with bis cus
tomers. During August of last

WOMEN AND THEIR FluHT.
E. V. Debs in Ripsaw.
Wont in'! battle for the ballot is
being waged with increasing in
tensity in every state of the Un
Ion. Eleven states have already
wiped away the sta.n and given
woman the ballot. A number ol
other states have granted a Urn
ited frit neh.se.
This is an especially important
y ar for the women In their fight
for their political rights. Four
East rn states, to-wit New York
Pennsylvauia. Massachusetts aud
w Jersey vote on a constitu
tional ami ndment this fall to
grant women their politiea'
rights. This amendment is being
fought viciously by all the powers
that maintain sweating hells and

The man who Is so wanting in

living certificate of the absolute

domination.

Men still die for their country
and die as gladly now as they
died iu Home or in tbe land of
Canaan. Hut it is not always of
the fathenand that they think
when the death summons comes.
Here is a very striking passage
from a story of the battlefield
which was lately given to Mrs.
Philip Bnowden, wife of the En
glish labor leader in parliament,
by an officer of the Tront :
" It is not alw ays the shrieks of
the wounded as they fall. It Is
not the sight of the dead as they
lie there, but it is the cry of the
wounded hoys calling for their
mothers, and there is no one to do
anything for them. They are the
bo.Vj of 16 and 17. arid e ea
younger. They may say. 'mother'
'mutter,' but In their agony all
those boys call for the one who
has given them the greatest care
'ii their lDes."

comes to the front in death The
"mother country" is the country
of the mother, and it Is the moth
