A long struggling liny ul Uewocrats
And petty political winners joined in
the red lire glout parade last night and
delighted ilie large crowd of spectators
who lined the street*. In the line of
enthusiastic followers of Wilson. Cornwell
unci Neely were nearly four hundred
persons, including the four hired
hands which blared forth music of all
kinds to suit most any taste.
The affair was more in the nature of
u serenade lor uio K''|iiiuiii.'iin party
mid the West Virginian than ? was a
celebration of triumph lor the Democratic
county victory.
Interspersed between the hands were
the marchers carrying red lire and
banners with Imp.ting legends painted
on them. The procession formed at
J-'irst street and Fairmont avenue and
marched up Walnut avenue to Sixth
and then back down Fairmont avenue
ina up Main street.
Not satisfied with tlie first trip
through Malu street the parade went
'to Qutncy street, down Jackson and up
Lj' . Clevelaud und through Alain street
p-% *gaiu to the court house corner where
Bpky't disbanded. At this place short talks

The crowd was an enthusiastic one
jv* and the well trained Ncely club and
s the Wilson club which have been faith..
.til audiences throughout the campaigii
led tin* cheering and howled ntadiy
every time the patriotic principles of
the Democratic party were mentioned
I ;>r the sterling character of their successful
candidates referred to.
One of the must amusing leutures of
iho parade, to the crowd assembled
llong the sidewalks, was tile float ear
fled 4?ii :i v.ngon. This was a boat ill
which sat thai sterling Democrat of
Marion county, licit I lug lies, alias
Dirty Neck." Uort was enjoying the
jvation he was receiving immensely.
The float, carried a banner with the
legend "Hughes goes up the river."
Mori was adorned with more than his
lMital growth of whiskers and wore a
high silk liai and lung black coat.
After the crowd had listened to the
speeches from the court house steps,
many of thorn came to .Monroe street
and gloated before the West Virginian
-i office. Finding no one at home to receive
them they were rather disappointed.
Liut wishing every one to
? know that they had called they paint2d
on the sidewulk a sign in large white
letters which told the news that "Wilson
is elected."
Many of those who had turned out

Were the vital tueuus of success in this
county. Thu negroes however had not
been allowed to march although many
of them desired to.
Among the crude primitive ideas or
wit which were displayed on the cards
and signs carried were the following
gems: "The llest .Men Won." "And
We Did Not Need New York to Do It."
"Gone But Not Forgotten. Ira." "Wontier

CHARLESTON. \V. Va.. Nov. 11.?
That the Democracy of West Virginia
now has III view resort to notorious
tactics such as characterized the theft
of the governorship from Judge Nathan
B. Ooff in IXSS became known here
today in connection with plans lieing
made by tlieni lo gain control of the
State Hoard of I'ubiic Works, by the
removal of all the Itonuhlirnn stale of.
l'icials ill thi! next administration.
The interests are desperate anxious
to guin control of the State liourd of
l'nhlie Works, made up ot nil the state
elective officers, and to this end they
expect to institute contest proceedings ,
to deprive tlie successful Itepuhlican
candidates for auditor, state treasurer,
commissioner of agriculture, attorney!
general, superintendent of tree schools
and secretary of slate from tile offices
to which they have been elected.
The manner uf doing tills, it is declared,
will be through the institution
of contest proceedings against all
these officials. Section I'll of the
(.'ode of West Virginia provides thai in
case of contest of any of these offices
that It shall be heard and decided ov a .
special court to be instituted as fol-1
lows: The Ttcraou declared, clectdll I
shall select one, the contestant nnoth- j
cr. and the governor a third person
who shall preside in said court; and
the three, or any two of thein. shall;
meet at a time and place to be appointed
by the governor, and being.
first duly sworn impartially to decide
according to Inw and the truth upon;
the petition- returns and evidence sub- i
milled them shall proceed to henrandj

decision uf this tribunal has been de- j
( lured by the supreme court to be I
final.
The Democratic candidates for the'
various state ofliees could delay the I
filing of contests until such tiine as1
would rentier it the duly of the next j
governor. John J. Cornwall, to appoint i
the third person to sit as a member I
ut this tribunal to hear these contests,
and it is anticipated that there I
would be little delay in ousting alt:
the Republican state officials who are |
elected on the fare of the returns. I
Republican leaders here today learn-!
ed of this witlt a good deal of concern |
and it is likely that steps will be taken !
immediately to protect the interests'
of the Republican officials and to prevent
the Democrats front carrying j
