DEMOCRATS
HAVE HOUSE
AND SEHAT
NEW YORK, Nov. 9. Congres
sional election returns which were
nearly completed tonight assure Presi
dent Wilson in the forthcoming ad
ministration, a Democratic senate, but
with five districts still undecided, the
best that the Democrats could claim
at midnight was a plurality of four
votes in the house.
Upon the basis of revised returns
the Democrats have elected 215 mem
bers of the house and ,the Republicans
211. In addition there have been
elected one Independent, one Socialist,
one Progressive and one Progressive
Protectionist. Four districts in West
Virginia, two of them normally Demo
cratic and two Republican and one
district in New Mexico, are still un
decided. If these districts do not
change the Democrats will have 217
and the Republicans 214, a plurality of
only three. As there will be four
members of minority parties, a work
ing majority for the Democrats is im
probable. The senate, according " to latest
figures, will consist of 54 Democrats
and 42 Republicans, a majority of 12.
The Democratic majority in the pres
sent senate is 16. The only develop
ment in the senatorial situation today
was strongly indicated by the election
of A. A. Jones, the Democratic can
didate in New Mexico, who was lead
ing his Republican opponent, Frank A,
Hubbell, by a majority which Demo
cratic leaders regarded as safe.
An unusual feature of the result is
the election of the first woman to
congress, Miss ,Jeannette Rankin, Re
publican, apparently having been
elected in Montana.
Until a late hour Democrats had a
plurality of six and a possible ma
jority of one but revised returns from
New Jersey, indicating the defeat of
Representative Thomas J. Scully
changed the result. Scully apparently
has teen defeated by Robert Carson,
Republican.

COUNTRY CLUB
PROMOTERS MEET
(From Saturday's Daily Miner)
The meeting o fthe proposed coun
try club promoters Thursday night,
owing to the excitement.incident to the
presidential contest, drew only a small
attendance. Discussions were had on
various subjects. A ways .and means
committee, consisting of D. N. Stew
art, H. H. Watkins, C. J. Walters, J.
B. Wright and G. R. Franklin, was
appointed to investigate and report
upon the most feasible plans for suita
ble buildings and other matters.
Carl G. Krook will have a set of by
laws and rules drawn up before the
next meeting and will pattern them
from the best now in use by other or
ganizations of a like character. The
members adjourned until next Thurs
day when it is expected that the major
portion of the 62 charter members en
rolled will be present
IS
(From Chloride feectton Dally Miner)
The Chloride Water company is
constructing a new reservoir in the
eastern portion of the camp that will
furnish water to the residents of that
section. At the present time the
gravity-pressure from the tanks in the
lower end of town will noe force the
water to the higher ground, and it is
to. overcome this condition that the
new reservoir is being built.
The company has a force of men
laying water mains along Tennessee
avenue, taking advantage of the re
construction work being done by the
county's road builders.
The work being done by the county
on Tennessee avenue is most com
mendable and thorough.
GO TO MOHAVE COUNTY
FOR YOU PICKERINGITE
KIRKLAND, Ariz., Nov. 2. Com
mercial deposits of pickeringite, a
rare mineral used extensively in the
manufacture of dyes and in tanning
have been discovered by Ed Johnson, a
mining operator of this district. John
son accidently discovered the deposit
while doing tome prospecting. He
sent samples of the mineral to Wash
ington, where it was examined by gov
ernment geologists. They advised
Johnson of the nature of the discov
ery, and asked him to try it in tanning
leather. Johnson found, on carrying
out the experiment, that fine leather
could be produced from rawhide with
in 18 hours by dipping it in a solution
of pickeringite. Pickeringite, it is
said, is also greatly in demand for use
in the manufacture of paper, and as a
base for dyes. Johnson refuses to tell
where the property is located, but s;i)-s
he has tons and tfins of the mineral
in sight. Close friends of Johnson be
lieve that the strike was made in what
is known as the desert district, along
the western boundary of Yavapai
county.
COPPER AGE VISITER
BK THE STOCKHOLDERS
From Chloride Section Daily MintrJ
W. N. Sill and E. E. McNab of Tul
sa, Okla., and L. B., Wood of Los An
geles, all stockholders of the Arizona
Ore Reduction company, holding com
pany for the General Metals company,
which owns the Copper Age, are
spending a few days watching mine
and mill developments at the Copper
Age property.
The excavation for the big reservoir
has been completed and the workmen
will begin pouring concrete in another
two or three days. Chappell Brothers
are engaged in hauling the large sup
ply of cement that will be used in the
construction of this tank. Sixty thou
sand feet of lumber has been ordered
and is en route from Los Angeles for
use in this work.
The origin and the natural distribu
tion of the 300,000,000 of gold that
has been mined from the tertiary
placer gravels of the Sierra Nevada of
California is the subject of a report
by Waldemar Lindgren, which has
been published by the United States
Geological Survey as professional
paper 73.
The Geological Survey's studies of
the tertiary placer deposits of the
California Sierra began in 1886 and
were concluded about 15 years later.
During this period 22 quadrangular
areas were topographically mapped
and 14 of these were studied in geo
logic detail and the results published
by the survey in geologic folios. Pro
fessional paper 73 includes the salient
features of this earlier work, most of
which was done by. Mr. Lindgren him
self. This report, thus comprehensive
in geographic scope and minute in
geologic detail, is believed to be the
most complete and thorough descrip
tion of a great "placer gold province
ever published.
In the main the report is a detailed
description of the entire area covered,
including the gold placer gravels, but
Mr. Lindgren's general account of the
tremendous earth forces that built up
the Sierra and of the processes that
freed the gold from its mother rock
and brought about its concentration in
prehistoric river channels forms alto
gether, a most impressive description
of continent building. Looking back
ward through inconceivable vistas of
time in which periods covering mil
lions of years supplant the centuries
by which we now now compute its pas
sage, the geologist pictures the up
lift of the new-born mountain range
by upward-forced great bodies of
molten granite. This uplift was ac
companied or closely followed by the
formation of veins and seams of gold-
bearing quartz, and the resulting high
land was then planed down by erosion
caused by rainfall and the action of
streams of water.
Tracing the long course of this early
history the geologist now finds that
toward the end of what is ' known as
tertiary time a comparatively recent
geologic period volcanic forces that
had long been quiescent vigorously re
asserted themselves. Flow of rhyolite,
a volcanic rock, pouring from many
craters, filled valleys that were cov
ered with gold-bearing gravel, deeply
burying the gold and causing the for
mation of new stream courses.
The geologic events thus outlined
long preceded the period of human
history in which these metal deposits
were mined. In 1849 an army of gold
seekers invaded the Sierra. They
worked first along the present
streams, but gradually the metal was
traced to the old tertiary river beds on
the summits of the ridges and to the
quartz veins, the primary source of all
the gold in the Sierra Nevada. Mil
lions of dollars in gold were produced
annually up to the '70s of the last
century, but the gold mining industry
has slowly diminished, until now less
than $1,000,000 is produced annually.
the decline being due- to the prohibi
tion of hydraulic irining and the ex
haustion of the riccr channels suit
able for drift mining.
The total output of gold in Cali
fornia is estimated at $1,200,000,000 to
$1,500,000,000, about one-fifth of which
has been derived from quartz veins,
$300,000,000 from the teriary gravels,
and the remainder from the quater
nary deposits.
A copy of professional paper 73 may
be had free of charge upon application
to the director, United States Geolaji-
cal Survey, Washington, D. C. The re
port is illustrated with photographs,
diagrams and topographic and geo
logic maps.

NOTED MINING
ENGINEER NOW
IN KINGMAN
(From Saturday's Daily Miner)
C. S. Herzig of New York, who en
joys an international reputation as a
mining engineer and who recently won
new laurels in the mining world
through his successful solution of the
perplexing and intricate fault problem
of the Emma Copper properties at
Alta, Salt Lake county, Utah, is a
visitor in Mohave county, having ar
rived in Kingman Thursday evening
from Salt Lake City, his western
headquarters.
Mr. Herzig is president and consult
ing engineer of the Emma Consolidat
ed Mines company, which recently
absorbed the Emma Copper company
and old Emma Mines company. From
the shallow surface workings of the
two properties millions of dollars
worth of rich silver-lead ores were
produced in the 70's. The ore bodies
were all cut off by a fault. It is es
timated that fully $1,000,000 has been
spent in the last'40 years by various
operators in search of the lost ore
bodies.. Under Mr. Herzig's direction
the intricacies of the geology were
unraveled, the faulted portion of the
ore bodies located by diamond drilling
and in a few weeks active production
will once more commence. About $50,-
000 is being spent to equip the mine
with hoisting and pumping-machinery.
The old shaft, sunk by former opera
tors has already been unwatered, and
only about 100 feet of crosscutting
needs to be done to reach the con
tinuation of the famous Emma ore
body, which has a record of about
$7,500,000.
Mr. Herzig is also consulting engin
eer of Arizona Copperfields, Inc.,
whose property is located in the Min
eral Park quadrangle of the Cerbat
mountains, about 20 miles north of
Kingman, and has been retained in a
like capacity by the new Monster
Chief Copper company of Jerome,
Arizona.
Mr. Herzig is at present in Kingman
for the purpose of studying the hold
ings of the Arizona Copperfields. He
will remain here on that mission for
about a week, after which he will
make a journey to Jerome to inspect
the Monster Chief. After a stay of
several days there he will return here
for a brief sojourn, thence to Salt
Lake City. He will, . however, make
frequent visits to the Arizona Copper-
fields and the Monster Chief.
Returning to Kingman last evening
after his initial visit to the Arizona
Copperfields, Mr. Herzig said:
"I merely walked over the property
today. I cannot make a statement as
to my opinion of it until it has been
thoroughly geologized. However, I
can say that I saw today numerous
favorable indications which lead me
to believe that, with properly directed
development work, we will make a
mine of it.
"Before starting any active ex
ploratory work, we intend to make a
comprehensive geological study of the
ground, including a topographic and
geologic map. This work is being
done by J. J. Beeson, who has been
associated with me in the work at the
Emma Copper properties in Utah."
CELEBRATE VICTORY
(From Friday's Dally Miner.)
When the news of the re-election of
President Wilson was flashed into the
Daily Miner office over its Associated
Press leased wire, the big crowd of
Wilson boosters went wild and were
soon parading the streets.
Red fire was set off in the main
streets and soon the hills were re
verberating with the booming of giant
powder. Automobiles with raucus
horns were soon tearing through the
streets filled with madjy joyful Demo
crats, shouting the good news-.
Not in many presidential years was
there so much enthusiasm turned loose
by the local party adherents.
CANNOT SEE JOKE
(From Saturday's Daily Miner)
Two ladies were passing the Daily
Miner office yesterday talking seri
ously over the election. Said one lady
to the other: "I do not mind getting
beaten, but I don't like to have those
d n Democrats laugh at me."
STUDY OF
The state of Arizona is particularly
fortunate in having as curator of its
museum Prof. Byron T. Cummings.
He is a native of the state of New
York, a graduate of Rutger"s college,
New Brunswick, N. J., 1889, with a
master's degree in 1892. From 1893
to 1915 Professor Cummings was with
the University of Utah, for many
years the dean of the College of Lib-
eraal Arts. During the years of his
life in Salt Lake City Professor Cum
mings became interested in the study
of the ancient Indians in southern
Utah and northern Arizona, and has
been a frequent contributor to maga
zines relative to this subject. He has
also published pamphlets on the great
natural bridges of Utah, the ancient
inhabitants of the San Juan drainage,
the textile fabrics of the Cliff Dwell
ers, the Kinas of the San Juan Drain
age.
During his connection with the Uni
versity of Utah, Professor Cummings
conducted six field expeditions inves
tigating the ancient Indians, and since
becoming curator of the state museum
of Arizona has conducted two more,
gathering many specimens for the mu
seum.
Professor Cummings organized and
secured state aid for the Utah state
museum, and is engaged in similar
work for the state of Arizona. The
law creating the University of Ari
zona provides for and makes it en
cumbent upon the board of regents to.
provide a museum, but there has never
been any financial provision made by
the state. Probably no state in the
union is richer in archaeological relics
than Arizona universities of the east
ern states have been sending out par
ties every year removing from the
state material with which to fill their
own museums. Arizona has overlook
ed this up to now, but with Professor
Cummings in charge, we will undoubt
edly get our share.
Practically all of the material that
has been gathered so far has been
boxed up and is still in storage, as
there is no place for its display. The
next legislature will undoubtedly pro
vide for a museum building, as it is
one of the richest of the state's re
sources.
(Front Saturday's Daily Miner)
Jay S. Harrison was a Kingman vis
itor yesterday from the Thumb Butte
section of the Union Pass country.
He reported the cutting of four feet of
ore in the Oster-GIoria shaft, which
gave a result of $53.60 gold per ton.
The shaft is located on one of the
45 claims of the Oster company which
recently took over the property from
Mr. Harrison. Several other openings
on the group are showing up well.
The Thumb Butte property adjoin
ing has cut into its ledge, but owing
to a heavy flow of water, work is pro
gressing slowly.
NDIAN GIRL IS
DROWNED IN RIVER
(From Saturday's Daily Miner)
Zadock Sheffield, newly elected jus
tice of the peace of Oatman precinct
and who has been recently appointed
to fill the vacancy in that office, per
formed his first official act Wednes
day when he was summoned to Fort
Mohave to hold an inquest over the
body of an Indian girl who had been
drowned there.
A couple of the girls from the gov
ernment institution at that place ran
away. When the authorities went in
search of them they attempted to
hide in the lowlands. Both girls fell
into, the river while eluding their pur
suers, who were close enough to save
one of them. The other girl was far
ther gone and could not be revived.

VETERAN OE CIVIL
(From Saturday's Daily Miner)
F. E. Farley, a veteran of the Civil
war, died at the Kingman hospital
last Thursday at noon. He had been
ailing some time and was brought in
from Union Pass suffering with pneu
monia, a few days prior to his death.
He was about 70 years old.
The deceased had resided in Mohave
county many years, coming here from
San Diego. He located a number of
mining claims in the Union Pass sec
tion and had been developing them
for several years, opening up god
showings of ore. A few years ago he
had one of his limbs amputated, ow
ing to blood poisoning, and never fully
recovered from the effects of the op
eration. A brother in San Diego has been no
tified and the body is being held at
the Van Marter undertaking rooms to
await his arrival.
BACK FROM BUSINESS
VISIT TO MINNESOTA
(From Saturday's Daily Miner)
J. H. Conway is again in Kingman
after a business visit to Minneapolis,
Minnesota. He has been away for
several weeks attending to matters
pertaining to the Leviathan Mining
company operating molybdenum mines
in the Copper Canyon section on an
extensive scale. The property con
tinues to show up well and before long
the management will have a reduction
plant in operation after which produc
tion will be greatly increased.
