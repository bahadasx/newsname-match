adopt the same forjn of county gov

1884 when Cleveland won out by
1,000 votes in New York after days
of suspense. Then as now the Re
publicans claimed the earth.
There are 2,300 Minnesota soldiers
on the border, two-thirds of whom
are reported as for Wilson. These
votes to be sent in may hold the bal
ance of power in that state.
Some states allow their soldiers to
vote wherever they are and the total
on the border was 4,266 for Hughes
and 3,611 for Wilson, not including
Virginia and New York, sent home to
be counted.
A. Stream, a Democratic elector in
Washington, died just before the

Wilson 27,000 and Capper, Republi

oted for Wilson. '

New York, Nov. 10. President
Wilson has carried California and has
j been re-elected.
Fifty-hours after the polls closed in
, California, Republican Chairman
Rowell conceded the state to the pres
ident. Thus the thirteen votes need
ed to assure the president a majority
in the electoral college dropped into
the democratic column and apparently
ended the suspense and anxiety of an
election which has been unparalleled
in American political history.
Republican Chairman Willcox when
informed that the president had car
ried California only replied: "I have
nothing to say."
Secretary Tumulty, at the summer
white house at Shadow Lawn, sent
the .news by wireless to President
Wilson on board the yacht Mayflower
enroute to RhineclifF, N. Y.
TiJe( California returns showed that
with1 only 48 districts missing the
president's pluralily in the state was
2,970.
Barring some wholly unexpected
turnover in the incomplete stateslean
ing toward Wilson or a change on a
recount, California s acquisition to
Undemocratic column, make 269 elec
toral votes without New Mexico's
'1
pit
three. In New Mexico at midnight
the president was leading by 2,634
votes with 158 districts missing and
it was not believed this advantage
could be overcome by Mr. Hughes.
Conceding West Virginia, Oregon
and Minnesota to Mr. Hughes and
he was in the lead in all three only
gives him 255 votes, 11 less tlian the
required majority. With 172 votes
in sight President Wilson had six to
spare for a possible split of electors
in California nr a sudden reversal in
New Mexico.
