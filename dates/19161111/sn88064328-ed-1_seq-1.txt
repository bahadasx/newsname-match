Wilson Returned as President.
Third District has Virtually Returned to Demo*
cratic Ranks, Judge Martin Seemingly
Leads by But a Few Votes.
Judge James Simon, Democrat, Defeats Hon. L. 0.
. Hacker, Progressive.
Never in the history of this
country has such an interest bej-i
manifested in a result of a Pre-»!
dential election as was that of last
Tuesday, and even as we write
these lines we do not know but
what the results might be changed
as all of the returns from the
"Western States have not yet been
compiled. On Tuesday night'are
when the returns came over the
Western Union -at was to the ef
fect that Hughes, the Republican
candidate had won. This was
toased on the first returns from
the Eastern States and on Wed
nesday all of the big dailies
throughout the United States re
produced pictures of Hughes and
Fairbanks, feeling assured the
West would .be ri«rht in line with
the East. On Wednesday durin«
the mornimr hours, however, when
messages were flashed over the
wires from the extreme Western j
States, a decided change came
over the people that our own
President would be reinstated in
the Presidential chair for another
f^r years and the Democratic
pmcies of the present adminis
tration had been endorsed by
majority of the American people
In this District when the Dem
ocratic Party placed in nomina
tion Hon. Wade O. Martin of St
Martin as its standard bearer, lit
tie did the members of the
Party realize that the old
Third was readv to come baat to
to the Democratic fold, but as time
grew on it **s very evident that
Mr. Wade Martin had made many
converts to the canse of Dcmoc
racy. At every meet in«?, though
the attendance was nothing to
bra? upon, it was plainly visible
that he had made such impres
sions upon the voters that when
the votes would be counted the
Democrats would have no reason
to regret their selection. When
taken into consideration that only
two years ago this District had
elected a Progressive Congress
man with a majority of over four
teen hundred and now had come
within ninçtv-one votes of return
ing a Democrat to Congress, it
bespeaks much, not only for the
candidate of the Party, but for
the people who had resented the
attempt of a few leaders who met
at Morgan Citv and endorsed the
Republican administration, des
pite Mr. Parker's pleadings with
the American people to vote for
Mr. Wilson.
While the Progressive-Republi
cans arc claiming that Whit P,
Martin has won by 91 vote . the
Chairman of the Campaign Com
mittee, Dr. Paul N. Cyr, is ar
it

ranging to file contest proeeed
ings that will, in several instances
compel a recount of the returns in
several of the boxes in Lafourche
parish, where the Democrats do
not think they have had a square
deal. 'It is said at liowie, sonic
twenty-five Democratic v'»tes had
I not been counted at all. and we
told irregularities in La
fourche are such that necessitate
investigation on the part of the
Democratic candidate.
Judge James Virion ivho has
served three consecutive terms as
the 'District Judge of the 1î>th
Judicial District, which comprises
Iberia and St. Martin, defeated
his opponent, Jpdge L. O. Hacker
in the two Parishes by a large ma
jority, carrying New 'Iberia by
something like one hundred and
fifty votes, but losing the Parish
to Judge Hacker by something
like one hundred and three votes.
It was the concensus of opinion
that Judge Hacker would carry
Iberia Parish by at the least six
hundred and fifty and hi:, loss of
votes is attributed solely to the
mistake of his supporters endors
ing Hughes, as was done at Mor
gan City. His failure to roll up
the usual majorities given him in
previous elections over Judge Si
mon cannot be accounted for in
any other manner
any
Taken as a whole even with the
seating of Whit Martin of La
t « , tt ii e r<
fourche in the Halls of Congress
the result of the election locally
and in this 'District, is a clear in
dication of the drift of the people
back to their old love, the Demo
cratic Party. It now 'behooves
the leaders of the opposing Party
in this Parish, while there is an
opening, to come back and make
their fight for the local offices in
the Party of the people. It will
be remembered when the tariff
was taken off of sugar, the Demo
crats themselves expressed their
disapproval of it, at the time, in
fact the expense of the mass
meeting that was held in this City
condemning some of the leaders
at Washington was principally
borne by men who remained in the
ranks, knowing that it was the
only way to proceed in matters
of that kind. Notwithstanding
their attempts to keep the Party
intact, Teddy Roosevelt came
upon the scene and in a few
months, what was known as the
Progressive Party took root in
the Third »District, landing into
office Whit Martin of Lafourche.
Now that our Progressive friends
see the hand writing on the wall
it behooves them to come back
and declare themselves, as here
tofore, tariff for revenue Demo
crats.
We did not secuie -for publica
tion the votes given Mr. Emlie
Vuillemot, the District Attorney
elect as he had no opposition and
therefore the votes he received
are not near what he would have
secured had he had an opponent
in the two Parishes.

of' An lm P ortant ove,lt to interest
playgoers will be the appearance
of AI. II. Wilson, the singing dia
] 0( q comedian and company at
pu m «„ v n
\ t!, e Elks Theatre, New Iberia ou
„ , .. ...
Sat urday, November 18th, when
he "i 11 l,e seen and hea^l in some
thing different from his former
( offerings—namely a new Irish
song-play entitled "My Willarncy
Rose" which has been declared
ne of tlie present season's sue
cesses. Mr. Wilson's talent for
dialect will be shown in the role
of Tom Carey a roving son of
' Erin—ever ready for a "ruction''
; or a frolic and that he will prove
(delightful in dispensing Irish wit
ad humor can be accepted with
i eertainty since he has already
proved his adaptibility in any
! character he undertakes. The
1
story deals with the many remark
I able happenings by this rollicking
"Brother of a boy" and is as full
of enjoyable features as the heart
could wish. Throughout the en
tire play one is either thrilled with
the intense heart-interest enamor
ed with its romance or convulsed
with hearty laughter at the mirth
provoking situations. The,re is
no doubt that "My Killarney
Rose" is the best entertainment
Mr. Wilson has ever presented
and then the son-CT—all catchy—
all meritorious and all delightful
made doubly so by the charm of
the singers voice. They breathe
the very atmosphere of the Eme
rald Isle their titles being "My
Killarney Rose." "The Love I
Give to You." "Where the Sham
rock ^"ows," "Mary Houllihan"
and '"ie Yodel that Stole my
Girl Away."
