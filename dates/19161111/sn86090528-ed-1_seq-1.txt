CANDIDATE OPPOSES
COURT PROCEEDINGS,
Shift of 8,000 Votes in Doubtful States
May Shift Victory From President
to Former Supreme Justice
By United Press.
New York, Nov. 11. Charles E.
Hughes will let his telegram of con
gratulations to President Wilson await
j the official count In California, New
Mexico
North Dakota and New llamp -
shire. If the official count confirms
tho Wilson victory, it is apparent now
that It is the wish of Hughes, if he
has the final say, that there be no
contest or court proceedings.
The reason why the Republicans say
they are still unwilling to concede de
feat Is that in five states whose vote '
is incomplete a change of eight thous
and votes might mean a shift of the
tide of victory from Wilson to Hughes.
It Is pointed out that errors Involving
several thousand votes are frequently
discovered on recounts and the Repub
licans hold that such errors may easily
be made.
In round numbers, according to the
unofficial returns, Wilson has a lead
or about 3300 in California while in
Minnesota Hughes has a lead of about
run irilh tlin jnlrHe- vnta 1 ncontl tpd
,,, , , t ,. I
Wilson s lead in New Mexico is about
2.100 and in North Dakota it is about
1.300. In New Hampshire the margin
fur Wilson is lesi than Vl(1- THP e1"
toral votes of these state total 37.
If Hughes gets Minneso he will have
2." 5 votes, eleven less than the number
required to win. If a recount then
showed New Hampshire to be Repub
lican, bringing the Hughes vote up to
239, and Hughes should gain several
of California's vote on a spilt, he would
reach the point where North Dakota's
1'ivo or New Mexico's three, recounted
ami found to bo Republican, would put
him over. This is the way it is fig
ured at Republican headquarters.

New York, Nov. 11. Outwardly at

ing any signs of disappointment c .
tho indications that he has lost tho
j biggest job in America.
Mrs. Hughes is a factor in main
taining a smooth balance in tho Hughes
camp. Neither Hughes nor his per
sonal staff has conceded the election
of Wilson.

Tho proposed ladies' Democratic pa

to the small number who responded

had met at the city hall for practice,
had volunteered to lead the parade in
case it was formed. There Is some

no definite plans have been announced.

Attired in long flowing white robes,
with faea masked with handkerchief:-,
of the same color, a half dozen enthu

ot what their party would do 't
Woodrow was done out of tho presi
dency. Rushing to the stage, as they
thought, they got tangled a? in the
maze of wings and doors and suddenly
found themselves in the ladies' dress
ing room where a femalo member of J
tho vaudeville troupe, iu scant attire,
was arranging her toilet for the stage.
Jim Dillon vows that even tho pas
tor's mask turned a deep scarlet hue
as he threw up his hands and excited
ly shouted: "Wait a minute, wait a
minute, ain't there a side door?"
The frightened woman, believing the
command was addressed to her, be
came even more alarmed and made a
hurried exit.
Instead of giving the Indian dance
on the stage as had been arranged the
clatter of hurrying feet through the
rear door into the alley resembled
more, tho rattling of a machino gun
than an Indian demonstration.
Reaching safety Deputy United
States Marshal Dillon in a high voice
oucceeded iu holding tho attention of
tho fleeing leader and shouted:
"Boys, hadn't v.e better go back and
apologize to Lee?," "Apologize! No,"
replied the pastor between breaths.
Wait till tomorrow."
Gaining the principal street and
freedom and being assured that they
were not pursued by tho enemy, the
Ku Klux gained heart.
Their spirits reviving they stormed
all the drug stores in town and held
them up for soft drinks. Then, cap
turing R. F. Thweatt they forced him
to take them on a joy ride and did
not release the captive druggist until
he had expended several cents in gas
oline. Then came the third bon fire of the
Chickasha campaign which was built
on the old spot on Fourth and Chicka
sha but which proved to be more cost
ly than the others, and as a result of
feeding it well several of the partici
pants in the frolic are sporting new
hats which were not won on election
bots.

were Rev. L. L-. Cohen, Jr., M. F.

Law But Other Stands

of the city officers to enforce, alter
November 13, the city ordinance re
quiring every automobile driver to
procure a license for which he shall
pay one dollar and further requiring
every driver to be examined at. a cost
of seventy-five cents per, is promised
by tho charge that this cannot legally
bo done.
Respecting thut clause which pro
vides for the payment of one dollar for
a city license, Judge A. L. Herr of the
law firm of Holding & llerr, asserts
that the ordinance Is in direct viola
tion of the terms or an existing state
law. Ho will not comply with the city
law himself and will furnish free de
fense to any citizen who Is arrested
for its violation and asks for his aid
in the matter.-
Regarding tho main Issue of the dol
lar license Judgo Herr said today:
"My contention Is that the city is
without authority to require any owner
of an adtoinoblle to pay for tho privi
lege of driving or operating his auto
mobile ou the public streets of the
rlty. It has no right to require any
license or permit for the free use of
the streets of tho city. That such tax
or license is expressly prohibited by
the laws of the state of Oklahoma by
virtue of tho act passed by the legis
lature in 1913 and published in the
Session Laws of 1913 is shown on page
328, section 8."
It is on the above proposition that
Judgo Herr will defend any automo
bile owner in tho city free of charge

JAPAN'S FOREIGN TRADE

'Tokio, Nov. 11. Some idea of the
wonderful progress Japan has made in
her foreign irado since the war is
gained from figures just announced
here. In every part of the world this
nation has been establishing her pro
duct. nrw markets have been opened
and steamship lines, subsidized by the
government, extended to every big
port of call on the face of the globe.
Greatest prosperity is being enjoyed
perhaps in the trade with Russia, Ja
pan's ally, who is buying everything
from munitions to boots and shoes.
In one mouth, last August Japan ex
ported goods to Russia valued at 5,-
313, Oik). This figure becomes all the
more significant when It is stated that
the imports this country received from
Russia reached only $'2,123, leaving a
balance of $3,1 1.173 in favor of the
exports.
