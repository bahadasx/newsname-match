A Chat With Times Readers
The Times is sett led in its new Pacific avenue home. Yon who
have moved know the satist'aetion with which that senlcnee was writ
ten.
A highly pleating home it is to us, too. In the first place, became
it is our own. in the second place, became it gives us multiplied facil
ities for getting out the kind of a paper we are striving to publish.
The business office occupies roomy, efficiently-arranged quarters
on the first floor. The press room is at the rear end of the same story,
and has the finest sort of ventilation and light. The entire rear of
the building, two stories high, is practically solid glass.
Upstairs in front are to be found the editorial rooms, a large suite,
attractively finished, convenient, light, airy and homey.
Behind them are situated the composing and Stereotyping depart
ments. Four immense skylights and a solid rear wall of glass make
these rooms the best lighted and beet ventilated print shop in Tacoma.
But the new building is not the only added facility we are just be
ginning to enjoy, for we have installed a big new press. You doubtless
before this have noticed the changed fold and the clearer print of your
paper.
With this new equipment and housed in this new building, The
Times is better able than ever befere to serve its readers. Our local
staff is generally recognized as being able to handle any news story that
breaks in this part of the country rapidly, accurately and Interestingly.
Our telegraph news is the equal of any in the world, as The Times
is receiving the full leased wive service of the United Press. In addi
tion we have the complete news and feature service of the Newspaper
Enterprise Association, unequaled in its field.
Our advertising is increasing month by month, and our circula
tion is gaining steadily.
Verily, 1916 lias been the Year of Promise—and fulfillment—for
The Times as well as for the city and nation.

HUGHES
AGAINST
CONTEST
(I lilted Preaa l.eaaed Wire.)
NEW YORK, Nov. 11 —Charles
Evanß Hughes will let his tele
gram of congratulations to Wood
row Wilson await the official
count of the votes In California,
New Mexico, North Dakota, New
Hampshire and possibly one or
two other states.
If the official count confirms
the Wilson victory apparent now,
it Is the republican nominee's
'wish—and he Is the one who, be
ing mainly concerned, has the fin
al say—-that there be no contest
or court proceedings.
The reason the republicans .till
were unwilling to cone.de defeat
is that in the five states wh.3e
vote is still incomplete a change
of 8,000 votes might mean shift
in the tide of victory from Wilson
to Hughes.
In round figures, unofficial re-
turns show Wilson's lead ln Cali
fornia about 4,000; In New Mexi
co, about 2,300.

HOT ROW
BREWING
IN G. 0. P.
A break between the county re
publican organization and S. A.
Perkins, national committeeman,
is imminent Saturday, now that
tho re. vii: of the election ha.o
been definitely settled.
A political tempest, blmllar, if
not so turbulent as the ■term
which has been stirred up ln Cali
fornia by the loss of the stute to
tho democrats, Is brewing In
Piorce county and state as the
result of the way Washington
voted.
Hi.wm Ight Peeved.
Flat statements are being made
hy county leaders at the court
house that S. A. Perkins, as le
publican national committeeman,
will have much to answer for in
the next few months.
Not only will he have to an
swer for the loss of the heads of
the stale and national tickets, hut
he will have a lot to explain !n
connection with the campaign in
Pierce county, they asserted.
Although all the .'ounty jo'is
are safe, the leaders are making
no secret of the fact that they are
downright peeved at the way th.y
have been treated during the cam
paign.
Tells 'Em to Go To
And when it comes to the na
tional campaign ln this 3tate—
well, Mr. Perkins' shoulders may
need bracers to carry all the
blame that Is being Jieaped upon_
To make matters worse, the re
publicans have "called" him on
the subject, and he has as much
hi. told them to mind their own
business.
The thing that Is sticking the
hardest ln the republican crop is
the way the Hughes campaign was
bungled, as they believe, in the
state by the national **ommitt9e
man.
Perkins will have to explain
why Washington was left out!
when the slices of the nation \l
campaign fund were divvied out.
Snub Cost Many Votes.
Perkins will have to explain
the apparently deliberate snub
bing of Senator Poindexter during
Hughes' tour of the state in tow
of the national committeeman.
The opinion is general among
the republicans that this one cir
cumstance probably lost the state
for Hughes, just as they believe
the snubbing of Gov. Johnson coal
the republicans California.
Perkins will have to explain
his papers' apparent indifference
to the success of the county ticket.
Await Chance to Swat.
Though none of the county of
ficers are willing to be quoted the
break with Perkins is evident.
The county ring is waiting lor
the opportune moment to take a
solid swat at the national com
mitteemen.

the potatoes and beets and cab
