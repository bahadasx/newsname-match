TUESDAY'S ELECTION WAS THE ENDORSE
MENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC AD
MINISTRATION.
On last Tuesday Woodrow w il
son,Democratic candidate, was re
elected President over Chas.
Hughes. Republican - Progressive
candidate, in one of the most con
tested races ever known. It was not
until the last State had been heard
from before the winner could be
known, for each one had his time
of being ahead and it looked at one
time as if the President had lost.
This is one of the greatest
victories ever won by a candidate,
with the "Old Republicans",
"Progressive", "Walla Street" and
all the others that ,go to make-up
a Republican party was there in
full force.

UARRIERE REFUSED
NEW TRIAL _BY COURT
Carriere's Attorneys will Take His
Claim For A New Trial
To Higher Court.
Hilaire Carriere will now have to
turn 'his hopes towards the
Supreme Court~ Of Louisiana.
The motion for a new trial
filed by his Attorneys was over
ruled by Judge B. H. Pavy on last
Saturday November 4th, after
listening to the testimony produce
why Carriere should be given a
new trial.
It was apparent from the begin
ing that the Judge would not grant
the new trial to the accused.
However, the Judge did not
preclude any of the testimony, and
was ready to teceive any new
teatimoiy, vwhicbt might havx. been
strong enough to ,allow Carriere
a new trial and there is no doubt
that he would have allowed
Carriere a new trial should he have
brought out any testimony that
would have justified him in doing
so.
The Judge, before passing the
sentence on Carriere stated that he
had tried all in 'his power to give a
fair and impartial trial, which in
his opinion he had gotton, further
Istating .that Carriere had obtained
the legal service of some of the
ablest men in Louisiana and that
they had used every effort in their
power to help him and that they
deserved unbounded praise for the
manner in which they had con
ducted this case, sparing nothing to
liberate the prisoner.
After tle sentence "Death
Penalty" was passed on Carriere,
Attorneys of Carriere made it
known that they would take an
appeal to the Supreme Court and
it is expected that the case will
coni' I before the Supreme Court in
the near future. Although, it is
statiel that Carriere Attorneys had
t8 ,lays in which to file leir
br'i f, and as we are informed, the
supreme CI'm ourt. is some two years
ht',bind with their cases. so that
if ii, exceplit on or pref'renre is
