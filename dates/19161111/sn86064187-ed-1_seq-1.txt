Socialists Slump.
Additional returns tend to hear out
early indication gin the count of a de
cided reduction in the socialist vote
and big democratic gain, the socialist
lo now being estimated at around
percent
Return o far show pluralities in
favor of the repeal of the registration
law and the adopting of the socialist
electiotv measure, but the silent vote
has probably defeated both proposi
tions, according to estimates of demo
cratic state headquarter. Returns so
far indicate the ditect vote will be in
suffic ient to overcome the silent vote
To be adopted the affirmative vote on
each of the tneastites must be a ma
jority of all votes cast in the election.
Legislature Democratic.
The democratic majority in both
branches of the legislature will be
maintained. Republicans so far have
shown no increases and it is believed
the socialists lost the five seats they
had in the last house.
It i probable thai George P.. Wilson
of Cestos, Dewey county, who was a
hold-over senator, being elec ted in 14,
will be the only socialist member of
the next law making body.
Socialist Disappointed.
The decrease in the socialist vote
is decidedly disappointing to members
of that party, who attrjjuite the de
crease to the popularity of President
Wilson with a large number of so
cialists. Hv tonight it is expected by the state
election board that at least two thirds
of the counties of the state will have
their official returns in.
