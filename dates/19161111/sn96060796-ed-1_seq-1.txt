Chicago, Nov. 7. Returns re
ceived up to midnight indicate a
Republican victory in Illinois by
a plurality estimated by Repub
licans at more than 100,000 for
Hughes and slightly smaller
pluralities for the Republican
state ticket, headed by Frank
O. Lowden for governor. The
race in Chicago, however, was
close. The vote was heavy.
Women voted for the first time
in Illinois on the presidential
issue.
Juneau, Alaska, Nov. 8. Of
5540 votes cast in 25 Alaska
towns for delegate to congress,
Sulzer (Democrat) has 3001,
Wickersham (Republican) 3916.
Of 5549 votes cast in 25 Alaska
towns 3512 were for prohibition
and 2037 against.
New York, Nov. 8. Late re
turns from Ohio indicating the
re-election of Senator Atlee, Po
merene (Democrat) over Myron
T. Herrick (Republican) virtual
ly ended the possibility of Re
publican ascendary in the sen
ate. With Democratic leaders
insisting that Hitchcock in Ne
braska and Pittman in Nevada
have been re elected and with
Kendrick probably elected in
Wyoming, the polical status of
the new senate would thus be
Democrats 52, Republicans 42.
with the result in Arizona and
New Mexico in doubt. Should
the Republicans carry both the
Democratic majority in the sen
ate would be eight.
Considerable activity is evid
ent at the old camp of Rose
mont, in the extreme southern
part of Pima county. Mr. Ram
sdell, who is also operating the
Hosey or Pinal, north of Pata
gonia, acquired several months
ago from N. A. and Johnny Mc

the Nar ragansett at Rosemont
and has over 100 men at work.
Leasers on the Lewlsohn prop
erties are also said to be making
good.
ARIZONA NOTES.
' ltems of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
The highest price ever paid
for cotton, since the growing of
the long staple variety became
a serious occupation in the val
ley, was made yesterday when
several bales brought 42 cents at
a sale held in Tempe.
A. S. McKenzie of Los An
geles has eccepted a position as
metallurgist for A. J. Hooks on
the Royal Blue and Wandering
Jew mines in the Alto country.
The new concentrating plant be
ing installed for treatment of
ores from these properties may
be enlarged if it proves the suc
cess in saving values that is
hoped and expected of it.
A fiuge mountain lion which
has caused over 1,000 damage
to cattle owners in the Skull
Valley district of Yavapai coun
ty, was killed by J. R. Patter
son, a hunter, after a battle in
which two dogs were badly
wounded and Patterson himself
had a narrow escape. The lion
had killed a two year old heifer
early last Monday morning.
Patterson took the trail and
came up with the animal in the
bed of a small creek. The dogs
attacked, but one got a blow
that broke its jaw and sent it
spinning, while the second dog
was terribly lacerated. The lion
attacked Patterson, who shot it
just as it reached him. Patter
son received a bounty of $5 for
the hide from the county super
visors. Prospector.

Southern Pacific Claims to Be First In
Adopting "Safety First."
The practical application of
the "Safety First" principle on
the Southern Pacific, dates back
as far as the days of the con
struction of the Central Pacific.
At that time a treaty was enter
ed into between the railroad
company and the various tribes
of Indians, under the terms of
which the red men, even when
on the war path, rigorously ab
stained from molesting the pas
sengers or employes. The at
tention of the United States
Senate was called to this in 1888,
when Attorney Creed Haymond
referred to it in an argument be
fore the Senate Committee on
Pacific Railroads in the follow
ing language:
"The situation in like respect
was not less dangerous between
the Sierra and Ogden. That
fovintry was infested with hostile
Indian tribes, constantly at war
with the whites. While this
danger existed and had to be
met, it was not by force of arms,
but by a treaty made between
the Central Pacific Company and
the Indian tribes between the
Sierra and Ogden, which has ore
both sides been most faithfully
kept from that day to this.
"Many times since the con
struction of the road these tribes
have bten at war with the Unit
ed States. In no single instance
have they violated that solemn
treaty or injured a man connect
ed with the railroad or a pas
senger borne upon its trains.
The influence of the treaty was
felt long years afterward, and
still is felt, on the Southern Pa
cific Railroad lines.
"The same obligation was im
pliedly entered into between the
Apache Indians, the wildest tribe
known to the continent, and to
the railroad company. Although
that tribe has carried murder and
arson over the territories of New
Mexico and Arizona and the
northern states of Mexico in no
single instance has it interferred
with the trains of the Southern
Pacific, its passengers or section
men, though repeatedly war oar
ties have crossed atd recrossed
the track."

Was He Really Stupid?
A young foreigner was being
tried in court and the question
ing by the lawyers on the oppo
site side began.
"Now, Laszky, what do you
do?"
"Ven?" asked Lanszky.
"When you work, of course,"
said the lawyer.
"Vy, work "
"I know," said
"but what at?"
"At a bench."
"Oh!" groaned
"Where do you
the lawyer,
the lawyer,
work at a
bench?"
"In a factory,"
"What kind of a factory?"
"Brick."
"You make bricks?"
"No, de factory is made
ov
bricks."
"Now, Laszky, listen. What
do you make in that factory?"
"Eight dollars a week."
"No, no! What does the fact
ory make?"
"I dunno; a lot of money, I
think."
"Now, listen! What kind of
goods does the factory produce?"
"Oh," said Laszky, "good
goods."
"I know, but what
kind of
good goods?"
"The best."
"The best of what?"
"The best there is."
"Of what?"
"Of dose goods."
"Your honor," said the lawyer,
i
give up.
