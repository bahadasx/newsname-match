ANNUAL MEETING
OF JEFFERSON
HIGHWAY ASS'N.
IN OKLAHOMA
.National Convention of Highway Di
rectors to Be Heid at Muskogee
Nov. 28-29.
HIGHWAY ONE YEAB
OLD NOVEMBER 15
Southern Sociability Run is Planned
From Muskogee After the
Meeting.
By E. T. MEREDITH
{President Jefferson Highway Ass'n.)
The state and national officiate of
the Jefferson Highway association
have set the date of their next na
tional meeting for Nov. 28 and 29.
The meeting will De held in Musko
gee. Okla. The newest state is plan
ning a monster reception to the offl
^elals of the great North and South
highway which connects them with
the big cities of Kansas City. St. Ji
seph. Des Moines. St. Paul, Minne
apolis* and Winnipeg north of them
with Shreveport and New Orleans
south of them.
This month is the first anniversary
of the Jefferson Highway associa
tion. It was organized in New Or
leans on Nov. 15 and 16, 1915.
Hard Surfaced bv 1919.
In a year's time, the Jefferson
highway has become second to the
Lincoln highway in prominence and
organization. Because of the nat
ural advantages of the route, wealth
of the territory served and compara
tively simple construction problems,
tfhe Jefferson highway promises to
be the first hard surfaced highway of
such gTeat length in the United
States. The slogan of the associa
tion Is "Hard Surfaced in 1919."
By hard surfacing any material Is
meant that will make a road which
is usable 365 days in the year. A
large part of the road will be grav
eled, some of it will be rock road
and some of it may be temporarily
surfaced with heavy asphaitum oil.
A few years ago it would have
been thought extremely difficult, if
not impossible, to make an automo
bile trip from any point in Minne
sota and Iowa to New Orleans, west
of the Mississippi river. Since the
establishment of a definite route in
the Jefferson highway, nearly all well
marked, and with a vast amount of
improvement between Winnipeg and
New Orleans, this* wonderful trip
from anywhere Is the extreme north
to the Crescent City at the mouth
of the Mississippi Is now a practical
trip for pleasure or business.
Observing travelers will hear farm
ers and business men in town?* and
cities along the Jefferson highway
discussing future trips to New Or
leans. Eight zones of climate are
traversed between Winnipeg and
New Orleans. Over four thousand
miles of farm land frontage will he
seen by the tourist between the two
terminal.'* of the "Great Vacation
Route."
Passes 87 Counties.
Eighty-seven counties, in the prov
ince of Manitoba, and the states of
Minnesota, Iowa. Missouri, Kansas,
Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana, are
rossed by the Jefferson highway.
very one of Theste counties now has
an individual Jefferson Highway com
mittee, in most instances consisting
of seven officers. Every state has
three state director and a state vice
president. The national officers are
a president, vice president, secretary,
treasurer and general manager. This
gives an idea of how complete is the
organization of the Jefferson High
way association.
A Southern sociability run from
Muskogee is planned to immediately
follow the directors' meeting on Nov.
28 and 29. Probabiy several thou
sand automobiles will join this pro
cession at different points along the
route and follow It part way on the
great southern trip. It would be a
big event for the localities* traversed
in Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana.
Any one is welcome to join this so
ciability tour and participate In the
southern hospitality which is await
ing the Jefferson highway builders.
REXALL STRAW VOTE
PROVES TO BE CORRECT
President Wilson's victory at the
polls is a striking verification of the
prediction made by the Rexall drug
gists through Barker's Drug &
.Jewelry store. Three weeks ago, the
8,000 members of the Rexall Drug
gists' association began taking a
straw vote. There were 961,396
votes cast. The final vote gave Wil
tson 554,500 popular votes against
396,8W for Hughes.
BELL GIRLS NOW:
NOT BELL BOYS
(By Uuited Press)
Cleveland. O.. Nov. 11
"Front," says tho clerk at the
hotel desk and instead of the
customary be-buttoned boy
there comes a "knookmedead"
blonde or a dashing brunette
to take your luggage and pilot
you to your room.
"Bell girls" are more at
tentive than bell boys, says
the originator of the idea.
That is the reason they have
been installed in the Hotel
-it Statler here.
Women guests find the "bell
girls" almost as useful as a
maid, the management states.
The "hook-me-up" problem is
now easily solved.
None of the drummers
have complained.

JAPAN'S FOREIGN
TRADEGAINSWITH
EVERY COUNTRY
By RALPH H. TURNER
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
Tokio, Nov. 11.Some idea of the
wonderful progress Japan has made
in her foreign trade since the war 13
gained from figures just announced
here. In every part of the world this
nation has been establishing her
products, new markets have been
opened and steamship lines, subsi
dized by the government, extended
to every big port of call on the face
of the globe.
Greatest prosperity is being en
joyed, perhaps, in the trade with
Ru&ia, Japan's ally, who is buying
everything from munitions to boots
and shoes. In one monthlast Au-
gustJapan exported goods to Rus
sia valued at *5,343,600. This fig
ure becomes all the more significant
when it is stated that the imports
this country received from Russia
reached only 832,125. leaving, a bal
ance of $5,311,475 in favor of the
export*).
South America is another part of
the world where Japan has found
markets which she hardly knew ex
isted before. Exports to the South
American countries for the first eight
months of this year amounted to 11,-
036,660. not a large figure when put
alongside records In American trade,
but worth considerable attention
when it is recalled that during the
same period last year Japan's ex
ports to South America were valued
at only $603,574. ThiiM her trade
in that direction has been nearly
doubled In a year.
The South American republics to
which the principal amounts were
exported are: Argentine, $444,275-
Chile. $352,335 Peru. $157,017".
Japan has found a new and very
profitable market in South America
and she intends to hold it.
Then comes China, a market which
Japan declares really belongs to her,
a market in which she promises to
outrival all other foreign ppwers.
Duriug the last ten days of Septem
berjust one-third of a month
Japan's exports to her neighbor
amounted to $2,446,303. For the
fln-t nine months of the year the
total amount of exports to China was
$60,751,721. an increase of $16,156,-
448 over the corresponding period a
year ago.
As an illustration of the way trade
with Australia has been growing in
the proverbial "leaps and bounds,"
Japan largest steamship company,
the Nippon Yusen Kaisha. a firm in
which the imperial family owns a
great part of the stock, ha** just ad
ded two more vessels to its line to
the Antipodes, making a total of ten
Japanese vessels which are now ply
ing between this nation and Austra
lian ports.
