Tho principal nddroaa nt tho wo

expressed that tho work would go
right on to lleud, llunw nnd likc
vlew. lfn tiaid tlmt fourteen different
railroads had actually heeu parted
Tor central and noutliern' Oregon,
upon which fiver $5.nuo,00r had
bci u spent. Thut iiuch powerful rnll
road builders as IIIH and Uarrlman
hml even llnnnced their lines entirely
iicrim-j the atnte, nnd then failed,
proved thnt no mr.n wuh Infallible.
However, oaeh new attempt acr
iously mailu and unitedly supported
by the people Interested wns getting
us nearer to success. To rnlso1 the
J, (ifin.OOO necessary to connect up
the live most lmporlnnL.otthe four
leen 'lines mentioned was Juatlllod
nnd he (Irmly believed It would' bo
done.
.Mr, Strnhorn emphasized his deter
mination to cement business Interests
and unlto the city n this railroad In

trally located passenger terminals,
convenient freight terminals, n lino
through tho city to tho upper lake
Hint would fncllltntu development of
Industries nnd Intercourse between
the city and upper country' nnd -while
doing ho to spend every dollar pos-
nlhlo here. Ho estimated that nt
least $1, Mid, 000 would be spent In
Klamath county and several hundred
thousand In tho city; that tho (axes
on railroad property and the annual
outlay for supplies nnd payrolls with
in tho city would far more than pay
the Interest on the bonds to bo voted.
The bonds would have, to bo sold nt
pur or more because (ho charter so
stipulates. The bond money would
bo expended hy tho city ns tho work
prngreafod and not hy himself.
lie expressed the belief founded
upon constant Inquiries ho wns re
ceiving from men of menus that by
t!'o time the first fifty miles of tho
road was built there would bo such
mi 'ulliix of capital and homescekers
mid such n development of buslenas
nnd Increaso In new taxable property
that tho taxes to bo levied for tho
bonds would never he felt.
In closing, Mr. Strnhorn appealed
fo the ladles, whom, he said, woro
omplro bulldors in tlio broadest
Bouse, to now unanimously dovoto
lliotiibelvcs to railroad building dur
ing the period Hint would bo neces
sary to clone up all the dctulls pre
liminary to beghnilng construction;
that Ihero was much to bo ilono nfter
voting tho bonds, and thnt thoy would
find II nhsolutely requisite to keep

eld was cleared nwny.

Covers more than 400 miles of new
railroad.
Connects terminals of four trunk
lines now entering edgo of Central
Oregon In different directions.
System projected by Straliorn only
when Southern Pacific nnd other
roadH disclaimed Intention of such
eoiiHtructlon for an Indefinite period
nnd becnuso peculiar railroad situa
tion or stato makes an Independent
line ng proposed tho only solution to
Central Oregon's transportation prob
lem.
Financial support of other commu
nities to bo served by this route has
nlreiily been tendered.
Construction Is to begin nt Klam
ath Fulls.
Itlght-of-wny has been secured
from lleud through Sliver Lake to
Lnkevlow. Terminals at both places
have boon provided for. No road
would bo constructed forty miles to
Sprnguo river and stop with tho few
remaining miles uncompleted to con

Election Tuesday is to amend tbe
city charter, empowering the council
to Increaso city's Indebtedness be
