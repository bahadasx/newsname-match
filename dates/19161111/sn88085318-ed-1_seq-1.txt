WILSON ELECTED
The Minority Winner of Four Years
Ago is Indorsed and Reelected This
Year by the Majority
The progressive voters of the
United States have reelected
Woodrow Wilson on the demo
cratic ticket. Some republicans
affected surprise at his election,
while democrats were surprised at
the narrow margin of his victory.
The west, for the first time in his
tory, has taken a deciding hand
in Hie presidential election, and is
responsible for Wilson's reelec
tion. Democrats, progressives,
republicans and socialists united
in the effort to retain the man
who has been president through
so many momentous events, and it
will ill befit the democratic party
to claim this victory by itself.
Tlie progressives who four years
ago indirectly elected Wilson
have this year directly reelected
him. as without their vote the
abundant flow of money from the
special interests of the east would
lihvo elected Hughes.
Hefting in the east followed the
eastern conviction that their votes
would do the electing, and 10 to
8 were the odds against Wilson.
The west, however, was 10 to 8 for
Wilson in nearly all late betting,
and it may now be said that the
west must hereafter be considered.
The election of a president with
out the aid of New York, Indiana
and Illinois was formerly consid
ered impossible—but nothing is
impossible in the great west.
Only those who know Senator
Poindexter can understand why
he has received so great a vote.
His record of always staying by
the popular side of public ques
tions, regardless of party lines,
has made him friends in all parties,
and he is elected not for what he
promises to do, but for what hi>
has done. He has stood stead
fastly by President Wilson's pro
gram of reform measures, and
previously was a leading progres
sive in congress. Knowing that
his future votes would be in 'ac
cordance with whatever party
won, members of all parties voted
for him.
C. C. Dill, who was said to have
been elected to congress on the
democratic ticket two years ago
"by accident," was this time
elected by design, if tire result of
the vote indicates anything. I It
being the first congressman from
this district who ever made any
impression in congress, was re
turned because of the results he
has obtained, and because it was
beleved he could continue getting
results. AH parties contributed
to his election. Stevens was the
banner county in his election.
The wet and dry issue has been
thoroughly settled in this state by
the election of the dry candidate
Ernest Lister, and the overwhelm
ing defeat of the two liquor meas
nres. Ridicule, abuse, false state
ments and all the underhanded ef
forts of the liquor interests were
unable to put over Bfoßride.
Party lines were broken in elect
ing Lister, and democrats must
concede that his election was made
possible only by the republican
and progressive dries. Wet dem
ocrats voted along with wet re
publicans for Mcßride.
Daniel 11. Carey is elected to the
■operiof bench. The result of the
judgeship contest iN a fortunate
settlement of a serious condition.
Mr. Grinstead wax largely beaten
by the misguided effort*) of his
backers in the eharaeter of the
contest that was waged, and nut
because of any lack of personal
standing. On hearing the result,
he congratulated his opponent and

stated that bo far as he was con
cerned no affidavits of prejudice
would be filed against Judge
Carey, The leaders of the bar of
the county are all pleased with the
selection of Judge Carey, and his
standing as a jurist throughout
tlie state may eventually bring to
Stevens county the honor of send
ing a man to the supreme bench.
Stevens county has for years
lieen republican, with only an oc
casional democrat elected because
of local conditions or great per
sonal popularity, This year the
republicans stuck closely to their
county ticket.
Hillings, democrat, was elected
assessor because of his exceptional
acquaintance over the county, and
his known worth. He has been
tiro warden for four yean and has
covered all parts of the county.
A. E. Dodson, who has proved such
a capable assessor for the last four
years, highly indorsed Qillings
for the work, and this was worth
considerable to his candidacy,
The republicans .failed to stand
behind the fourth attempt of
Howard W. Stull to be prosecut
ing attorney, and turned to l>. B.
Donley, the democratic candidate,
for relief. The Scott oaae, the
\'an Dissel iupport| the use of a

other reasons, are alleged for his
defeat, and it. may be that all en

not be one. The examiner leaves
the question to the public.
