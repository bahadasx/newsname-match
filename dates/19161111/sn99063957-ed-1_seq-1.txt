London, Nov. 11. The great battle between Russo

Petrograd and Berlin regarding yesterday's fighting em
phasize this conflict as the most important operation of

. Occupation of the Dunereav station, about two miles
due west of Cernavoda, was claimed by-Petrograd and
not denied from Berlin, appears to have given .the' Slav
: onicv armies at least a temporary advantage in their ef
, f6rts to press back or envelop General Mackensen's left
flank, which rests on the Danube. Military experts here
; say a Slav success at this point would change the complex

vantage to the Teutons. f v
Russians are reported in strong force about Cernavo

for a final smash. ,
: Reports of sanguinary fighting in this sector appeared
to be born out by other reports to Petrograd of hundreds
of dead picked up in -territory from which Mackensen's
forces have been hammered back. ;
; There was still some doubt here as to the sharp fight
ing about Predeal. Both sides claimed the advantage.
-The Berlin statement admitted the Transylvania Rumam

were repelled, Petrograd advices said the Rumanians
have all but completed envelopment of the Teutonic left

Newspaper ia Berlin
Says Hughes Would
Mean Imperialism
Berlin. Nov. 10. (Via Savville)
Taking it for granted that Charles
Evans Hughes has been elected presi
dent, most or the iterlin newspapers to
dnv published statements explaining
why. The Vossische Zeituug attributed
the supposed result to the Wilson for
eign policy.
The Berliner Tngeblatt asserts that
"President Wilson was defeated not
because of bis foreign policy but for
other reasons."
This paper says that the American
people approved the Wilson attitude
toward the war.
The Targes Zeitung says that the
election of Hughes means th.it the
money power's are now controlling the
United States government
The general impression is that he
election of Hughes means a high tariff,
a luilitnristie-iiuperialistie policy and a
sterner attitude on foreign relations.

i n"; By Perry Arnold
(United Press staff correspondent)
Now York, Nov! 11. Charles Evans
Hughes will let' his telegram of con
gratulations to Woodrow Wilson await
the official count ef the votes in Cal
ifornia, New Mexico, North Dakota,
New .Hampshire and possibly one or
two other states, j;
If the official fount confirms the
Wilson victory apparent now, it is the
republican nominee's wish and he' is
the one who, being mainly concerned,
has the final say that thero be no
contest or court ocoedings.
The reason the ropumieans still were
nnwilling to concede defeat is that in
the five states whose vote is still in
complete a change Of 6000 votes might
mean shift in the tide of victory from
Wilson to Hughes. Errors involving
several thousand votes frequently are
discovered in recounts. The republicans
hold they' very easily may have been
made, in the excitement of tabulating
results of one of he closest elections
in American political history.
In round- Jieures, unofficial returns
ahow Wilson's lead in California about
4,000; in New KeJfe,' about 2,3U0; in
North Dakota, aboutSOO; in Minneso
ta Huahes' lead about. 600 .(with the
soldier vote still to be counted) ;.
while in New Hampshire there is less
than ,100 margin for Wilson. The elec
toral vote of these states wnere iue
margin is less than 8,000 votes , totals
37.' .
Hughes now has 243 votes in the elec
toral college about which there is lit
tle doubt. The republicans figure Min
nesota will also1 bf his, bringing his1
total to 255. That la 11 less than the
26 majority required in the electoral
colleeed. If a recount should show New
Hampshire republican, bringing the re
publican total to zou ana Jiugnes snouiu
gain several of California's electoral
votes on a split of electors, possible
under the state laws, he would arrive
at tno place where North Dakota's five
vote, or New Mexico's tnree. recounwu
and found republican, Ikight put him
over, instead of Wilson.
Tlie-pnilless conferences ot rcpiiDiican
managers still were on today. They
were a few recriminations at what the
victnrinua democrats facetiously reier
red to as " the wake ' ' proceeded at the
republican headquarters, but for the
most part tho leaders were planning re
organization of the party beginning
already to look forward to 1920. One
thing that gave cause for joy was that
the democratic majority in the house
of representatives has been swept away.
Wilson no longer has eomplete domina
tion of the national legislature.

'THE LADY : '
FROM MONTANA"
Washington, Nov. 11.
"What 'II the speaker call the
newly elected" congress wom
an!"' The fixed form of addressing
members is "the gentleman
from" whatever state the gen
tleman 's from.
Congressional authorities
here, after trying the. sound
of various other titles, . finally
agreed on the obvious
"The lady from Montana."
THE 1ST WOMAN
CONGRESSMAN TALKS
kss Rankin of Montana Sews
As She Tells What She
i Intends To Do
Missoula,' Mont, Nov. 11. "I am go
ing to Washington to represent the wo
men an dchildren of the west to work
for an eight hour day for women, and
for laws providing that women shall
be paid the saiqewugea as men for equal
amounts of work. "
Miss Jeanette Rankin, newly elected
republican congressman or "congress
woman" from Montana, was sewing as
she aid this today. Even after enter
ing politics she refused to forsake, the
old household arts, cooking and needle
work. Miss liankin failed to become
excited when returns showed she was
running ahead of the republican ticket
in Montana, and later that she was
elected.
"I'm glad of this chance," was her
eomment when cheering friends "broke
the news."
Off course," said Miss Rankin to
day, "I know I'll be the Hirst woman
member of congress, but I woit't be the
last, and I believe I '11 be received with
Courtesy and as an equal by those east
ern congressmen, even though they are
enemies of suffrage. While' working
for suffrage in the east, I found that
no matter how' strenuously our oppon
ent fought us, they wore always ready.
to hear our side." :!
In addition to her eight hour dav
and equal wage laws, Miss Rankin in
tends to fight for woman suffrage from
the moment she gets into the capital
Her suffrage bill, she says will bt one
of the first introduced at the next se.i-
siop. She also declares her intention
of seeking extension of the child labor
laws, mother's pensions and universal
education. . ,
As a fighter, Miss Rankin's friends
believe she will make some of the old
est battlers in the house break ground.
Not so long ago she tramped through
deep snow potting bear and wolves just
for a pastime. Her father came to
Montana when it was an empty wilder
ness, and his four daughters endured au
the hardships of pioneers.
Miss Rankin showed the Montann re
publican organization some of her fight
ing qualities in the last few days of
the campaign. Upposed by the U. O. 1".
leaders in many towns, she went ahead
with tho Montana Good Government
league backing, kept her own republi
can banner waving, and made .speeches
In every city and hamlet in Montana.
In addition, she organized a telephone
round-up. On election day her friends
called every telephone number in the
state, and asked whoever answered if a
vote had been cast for Miss Rankin yet.
It i Good Fighter.
Washington, Nov. 11. "Jeanetfe's
the best stump speaker in Montana;
can dance like a boarding school girl
and,' believe me, she'll lead the men's
section of congress a merry little two
step." This is JessieXHardy Btubbs, a promi
nent suffragist, and teammate of Miss
Rankin, elected by Montana to be the
first congress-woman in the United
States. Suffrage workers are happy
over the Montana happening.
"now ia Jeanette running! ' ' was the
question with which they bombarded
the United Press all through the hours
from Tuesday night until Friday night.
- "She's a good fellow," Miss Stubbs
said;, "just a normal American girl,
who sat beside her brothers at college
and studied the same sociology and ec
onomics, She spoke often, at street
- fmeeting here.
She la young, attractive, ' bright
and intelligent-looking, has a keen,
well-balanted mind. She enjoyed being
heckled by the crowds, for she always
had eome-back-" , . - ' - ?
When suffragists came from all sec
tions in 1913 bearing petitions to con
gress. Miss Rankin made her trip by
automobile, making speeches all the
way. She got pretty hoarse, but arrived
happy and went to work lobbying.
"Somebody la our family has to come
to congress," said Miss Rankin when
she returned to her home.
Misa Rankin started out to make a
living as social worker, after gradu
ating from the University of Minnesota
and the School of Philanthropy in New
York. Then she went to work as a
paid field secretary for the suffragists
and spoke in nearly every state. She
got a big share of the credit for putting
Montana in the suffragist column in
1914. Furthermore, she can make her
own clothes and her family says she's
a good cook. -
