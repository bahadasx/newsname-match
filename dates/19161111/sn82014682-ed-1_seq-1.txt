In a atatement this afternoon by Gov.
Johnson, senator-elect, he charges that
a "few petty politicians," acting In

we are unable to undo." To this he
ascribes Wilson's plurality in Califor

National Committeeman Crocker

appear Viat Hughes was entirely re
actionary, and that he was neither in
accord with nor sympathetic with
California progress and achievement."
Crocker said: prefer to maintain
a dignified silence."

Pinkharn to hold up any active steps

been spent on the question, with study
by the City Planning Commission and
other bodies which the governor feels
are directly concerned with the work.
Plans and specifications for the big

several days ago by Superinten
dent of Works Charles R. Forbes. A

which has not yet . given Its approval
to the work.
' Today Forbes called upon the gov
ernor, to take up the .matter of Waiki

the superintendent to refrain from go

this view to Deputy Attorney General
A. G. Smith a few days ago when

and ; that he himself as governor is

BALANCE OF LIFE
Young Korean Who Shot and
Killed Stepfather, Declares
His Innocence
Motions in arrest of judgment and
for a new trial having been denied
him. You Chil Yong, Korean, today
was sentenced by Circuit Judge Ash
ford to spend the remainder of his life
at hard labor in Oahu prison.
You Chil Yong was indicted for first
degree murder. It was alleged that
he-, shot and killed his stepfather-in-lawast
March with a revolver. The
jury returned what was referred to
in court today as a . "compromise ver
dict," convicting the defendant of mur
der in the second degree. The Jury
also recommended that the extreme
penalty life Imprisonment be in
flicted, v V ; .:.- ,'.';
Upon convjetion, counsel for Yong
moved for an arrest of judgment. This
was denied. A motion for a new trial
was then entered and this was over
ruled. . '. , .
"I am not gunty," declared the de
fendant, through an interpreter, when
asked if he had anything to say why
sentence should not be imposed. "I
have been falsely found guilty."
Judge Ashford remarked that, in
the opinion cf the court, the killing
was a cold-blooded murder; that the
defendant: went to the house of his
relative by law with the full intent
of killing him.
"And I feel that, by the verdict of
v, .-r.. u j
j" .v f 3 Ju-j
deserts." the coiirt added.
Yong'8 defense was that the dead
man had fired at him. It was endeav
ored to show that a revolver picked
uru iu Suuw . I
up at the scene of the killing belonged-.
to the dead man. Detective Harry T,
Lake, nowever, made a search of the
dead man's effects and discovered a
pistol, cleaned and oiled, reposing in a
holster in a trunk. Witnesses for
the prosecution testified that this was
the only gun that belonged to the,dead
man. -: '
At the instance of City;. Attorney A.
