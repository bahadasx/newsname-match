NEWEST BULLET.
Claimed It Pierces the Thickest
Kind of Armor.
LEAD COVERING DOES IT.
Fired From Regulation Army Rifle, It
Will Penetrate Three-Quarter Inoh
Steel Plate and Other Objects Beyond.
Could Go Through Thirty Men In
Row.
New York.A new bullet, capable of
piercing armor as thick as that which
covers the famous British "tanks" or
that used in making trenches on the
Semme bomb and bullet proof, has
been invented and tested by the ord
nance corps of the United States
army. The bullet is of only 30 cali
ber but, fired from the regulation
army rifle, it will penetrate a three-,
quarter inch steel plate arid other ob
jects beyond.
It is said that the bullet would be
able to pierce from twenty to thirty
men in a row. It has been tested
severely at the Sandy Hook proving
BBIOADIEB GENEKAIi OROZIEB, CHIEF OF
OBDNANCB, U. S. A.
grounds by the ordnance corps, and
the statements published concerning
its efficacy are the results of actual
trials.
It has taken many months of ex
perimenting to develop the bullet,
which is exactly like the ordinary bul
let in appearance, but has an outside
covering of lead around the armor
piercing center of steel. This lead
casing acts .as a lubricant In passing
the bullet through the steel and is
ripped from the steel core as the bul
let passes through a solid obstruction.
Only a small number of the bullets
have been manufactured, and these,
were made entirely in government
shops. Fifty ordnance and-engineer
corps officers were present when
these were used in the first tests. A
three-quarter^ineh- steel plate about
forty feet long and twelve feet wide
was erected, and behind it were fixed
six silhouette targets in the semblance
of a soldier.
A detail of men from the coast artil
lery and ordnance corps did the firing.
The bullets would not pierce the steel
at 100 yards. At fifty, however, they
riddled the steel plate and the sil
houette targets behind it
It is not believed that the new bul
let will be valuable or necessary in
ordinary infantry engagements in the
open. Its worth is said to lie princi
pally In attacks on houses, steel shel
ters and other obstructions behind
which enemy troops are concealed.
Tests have been made to demonstrate
that the ballets can be fired from a
machine gun as well as a rifle.

CHINA FINDS IT HARD
TO DISBAND ITS ARMY
Soldiers Love Their job, and If Not
Paid They Loot.
Peking.China's toughest problem
now is how to disband the army raised
during the revolution. The government,
hard pressed for money, will have to
raise at least $30,000,000 to pay off the
800,000 men under arms, and unpaid
soldiers are always a menace in China.
Coolies regard military service as a
very desirable occupation. Once en
listed it is difficult to persuade them to
retire. They riot and become extreme
ly troublesome if an attempt be made
to disband them without liberal pay
ment. The commanding officers are
frequently as mercenary as the sol
diers. When the government fails to
give Its soldiers what they regard as
adequate pay the troops frequently be
come bandits and loot.
Each province has Its own military
governor and a distinct military organ
ization, presumably under control of
the Peking authorities, but actually in
dependent in most cases. Consequent
ly the Peking government is forced to
deal very diplomatically with the mili
tary organizations in the provinces,
particularly in the remote, provinces.
HARVARD MAN FOILS
SUN WITH INVENTION
Presses a Button In Bed and the
Window Shade Goes Down
as if by Magic.
Cambridge, Mass. Every morning
at 7 o'clock Henry R. Guild of Boston,
a Harvard senior, rolls over in bed.
Seven o'clock is too early for a senior
to get up, so Mr. Guild presses a but
ton and the shade at the distant end
of his chamber rolls down as if by
magic.
No rising sun is going to make him
leave his bed unseasonably. Some
morning he may miss a four alarm
fire by pressing the button, but he's
willing to take the chance, he asserts.
Getting up at 7 a. m. is a high crime
at Harvard, the same as admitting
Yale has a good football team this
year.
Henry Guild framed up a motor, at
tached to the curtain string and laid
wires to his bedside. When the sun
throws its rays into his bedroom every
morning, permitting, he
presses a button and the curtain flops
faster than in a vaudeville theater.
Mr. Guild's next invention probably
will be a trap door to throw tiresome
professors into the cellar by means of
a button that any student can press.
Life's attendant inconveniences aren't
going to bother him while electricity
can do the work.

Philadelphia.A patient whose jaws
had been rigid for twenty years, -who
had never learned to talk and who
had been obliged to obtain all his

subject of one of the many operations
performed at the various clinics here

Thousands of hunters are going into
the woods for week end trips, and ma
chines are also used for the purpose of
taking the hunters from one good
ground to another. This of course re

The idea of the union and the choice
of the lady are highly approved ir,
Japan. Prince Yi is twenty years old.

years.
All the necessary arrangements have

Prince Yi, and Prince YI, his brother
both stated to be matters of form,
since Count Terauchi obtained the con

lived entirely according to Japanese
custom.
The idea of such a union originated
with the late Prince Ito. No provision

racks in schools.
"Pupils have, a right to chew gum,"
said President Crabtree. "Teachers do
it, but they know when and how. Why
not teach these conventionalities to the
pupils?
"Permit the pupils to chew gum on
the playground and on the way to and
from school. But what will the poor
child.,do with, his gum while in the
recitation or assembly room? A gum
lack at the entrance of the room con
taining a number and peg for each

FOR HOLY LAND
IN CHRISTMAS SHIP
American Collier Will Carry Relief For
War Sufferers.
New York.America's 1916 Christ
mas ship for the relief of unfortunate
victims of the war will leave New
York Dec. 1. The American Red Cross is
co-operating with the American com
mittee for Armenian and Syrian relief
in collecting foodstuffs and clothing to
be sent to Syria on a government col
lier placed at the disposal of the latter
committee by Secretary Daniels.
The collection of the Christmas ship
cargo is in the hands of Albert W.
Staub of the American Red Cross re
ceiving and distributing station at
Bush terminal, Brooklyn. Mr. Staub
has already received countless bundles
of old clothing, unavailable for the
cargo, as military regulations preclude
the shipment of second hand clothing
in this cargo. He said. "It must be
emphasized that the only clothing
America can send to the unfortunate
ones in Turkey must be new and must
be sent prepaid to the American Red
Cross, Bush terminal, Brooklyn." Mr.
Staub sent the following letter from
the war relief information and ship
ping office:
"It Is more than significant that the
first letter to go out from the newly
organized Red Cross war relief infor
mation office has to do with a Christ
mas ship. It is doubly significant that
it is to take relief to a people living so
near the Holy Land."
MIKE HICKEY TELLS
OF HIS REFORMATION
Ex-Pickpocket, With Twenty
Years' Prison Record, Talks
to 400 Men.
Mike Hickey, once a notorious pick
pocket, with a record of nineteen and
a half years behind prison bars! told
400 men at the Sarlem branch Y. M.
C. A., New York, how he straightened
out and how other inhabitants of the
underworld could be helped to do the
same.
Mike's career as a thief lasted until
about four years ago. when he wan
dered, fresh from Sing Sing, into the
Cremorne mission, on Thirty-second
street. It ended there. Now he is night
man at the Bowery Y. M. C. A. and
passes his spare time helping his old
pai3 frotn Dannemora -and Sing Sing
to get their feet on the "straight and
narrow."
The trouble with the newly emerged
convict, he said, was the old story--out
into the world with a $10 bill and a
wish to keep straight a job until a cop
told the boss of his record, then no
more job broke one more trick to get
money to eat caught, and back to
prisoii.
What the convict needs is a bit of
belief and encouragement when he
starts to reform, said Hickey, adding
that more and more the employers are
beginning to give' this, so that many
men with long records as criminals are
now taking their places in honest life.
MOSQUITOES CLOSE MILLS.
Pest of Insects Compels Plants to Shut
Down.
Connell, Tex.The gulf coast region
of east Texas and the western part of
Louisiana have been afflicted with the
worst scourge of mosquitoes ever
known.
Several large lumber mills were
forced to close down on account of the
pest. Men and animals were tortured
by the bites of the insects. Cattle and
horses were attacked by veritable
hordes of mosquitoes, and the animals
huddled together in groups in an effort
to protect themselves as much as pos
sible from the bites.
On the farms smudge fires were kept
burning constantly to drive away the
pests, but these efforts seemed to be
of little a vail.
