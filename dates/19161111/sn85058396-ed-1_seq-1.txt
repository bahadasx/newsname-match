ADVANCING ON GENERAL
VON MACKENSEN'S LINE
Bucharest Announces Retreat of Enemy At
tempt Made to Regain Constanza.
I The issue in the Rumanian province
of Dobrudja, where RusBO-Rumanian
forces are apparently attempting to
regain possession of the Constanza
Tchernavoda railroad line, seems
again to hang in the balance.
Russo-Rumanian troops are advanc
ing from the north upon Field Mar
shal von Mackensen's left flank at
Tchernavoda and other entente forces
are close to the town along the route
of the twelve mile long bridge and via
duct which spans the Danlbe and car
ries the railroad across the extensive
marshlands west of the main stream.
Sofia reports under Friday's date
that Dulgarian artillery compelled en
tente troops which had advanced to
the west bank of the Danube to "re
tire toward Dunareav." Petrograd,
on the other hand, yesterday announc
ed the occupation of this town by the
Russians locating it two miles west
of Tchernavoda, which is taken to
mean that the Russians were approx
imately at the end of that portion of
the bridge which spans the main
stream.
Unofficial advices from Bucharest
today reported Von Mackensen's re
treat in Dobrudja towards the Tcher-navoda-Constanza
railroad line, contin
uing with fires observed in the direc
tion of these two termini of the road
in Dobrudja, this being held to indi
cate the possibility that their evacu
ation is imminent.
Fighting on the Somrae front in
northern France with the return of
more favorable weather conditions has
apparently been resumed on an in
creasingly important scale.
London announces tho storming last
night by British troops on the eastern
portion of the Regina trench on tho
northern portion of the Somme front
along a line more than half a mile in
length. The French have been activo
south of tho river where Berlin semi
officially admits they have scored
some success, while at the same time
claiming they are of insignificant im
portance. In this same' region north
west of Chaulnes, Paris reports an at
tack by the Germans last night in
the Denicourt sector, which is de
clared to have been repulsed by the
French with heavy German losses.

Berlin Reports Tremendous
Losses Sustained by Enemy
Over Impractiable
Ground.
Berlin, Nov. 11, by wireloss to Say
ville. Berlin newspapers publish a
statement from "competent mllitarv
authorities" saying the Anglo-French
drive on the Somme has been halted
by tho exhaustion of the entente
troops and thoir heavy lossos and by
unfavorable weather.
The statement nays:
"After the tremendous losses sus
tained by tho British and French on
November 5, when they omployed six
British and four and a half French
divisions without success in an at
tempt to break our front between Lo
Sars and Bouchavosnes, thoy have
been able to drive forward for large
attacks their exhausted aad decimat
ed troops over ground made imprac
ticable by rain. All attempts have
been stifled immediately by the firo
of our artillery and machine guns and
only south of the Somme near Pres
soiro did the French obtain Insignifi
cant local successes.
"Attacks launched repeatedly on
Wednesday in St. Pierrc-Vaast wood,
although continued until late In the
night, were crushed. With the clear
ing of the weather the artillery be
came more active, but the British and
French were unable to make a gen
eral attack.
Violent Encounters.
"Fighting on Thursday resulted In
isolated violent encounters near Ea
l ourt L'Abbaye, Guedecourt, Les
Boeufs and Pressoire, the entente at

WAGE EARNERS
MAKE APPEAL
Ask President Wilson and
Governor of Ohio to Inves
tigate High Cost of
Living.
Columbus, Ohio, Nov. 11. The ex
ecutive board of the United MIno
Workers of Ohio, representing 50,000
wage earners, today addressed to
President Wilson and Governor Wil
lis of Ohio a copy of a resolution
adopted by miners of this union In
the state demanding an investigation
of the high cost of living.
"We believe that the high cost of
living," says the resolution, "is occa
sioned by unfair and illegal specula
tion in food-stuffs and other necessary
commodities, thereby causing actual
hunger and distress in families where
the "bread winner Is steadily em
ployed." They ask that the government take
such steps after Investigation "as will
reduce the cost of commodities and
place the necessities of life within the
financial reach of the wage earner."
Mine workers are hard hit by the
high cost of living, the resolution de
clares, because the mines are not
working more than half time, duo to
the coal car shortage.

as was ever gained by a president
running for ire-election."
President Concerned Over Next House.
Williamstown, Mass., Nov. 11.
President Wilson is not concerned
over the refusal of the Republican
campaign managers to concede his
re-election. The chief thing worrying
him is the political complexion of the
next house of representatives, because
of its effect upon his plans for legis
lation. He has not yet received final
information on this point.

the result of the election as a vindi
cation of his past course and as of
approval of the general outlines of pol
icy in domestic and foreign affairs set
forth by him in his speeches as a
candidate for re-election.

Alleged Mistreatment of Pris
oners in German Camps Set
Out in Detail.
(Correspondence of the Associated
Press).
Paris, Oct. 26. Tho case of the
French government against Germany
in regard to the alleged mistreatment
of French prisoners of war is set out
in detail in a volume of ono hundred
pages just issued. The book sums up
reports of the Spanish embassy in
Berlin of delegates from the Interna
tional Red Cross society who visited
German prison camps, of doctors and
nurses who were interned in these
camps and of testimony given under
oath by crippled soldiers who have
returned to France.
Many Accusations Made.
Tho French government contends
that tho following accusations havo
been proved: Thoft from French pris
oners; killing of wounded French sol
diers; execution of civilians arrested
on the pretext of sniping; transporta
tion of prisoners In foul cattle cars
with healthy, sick and wounded
crowded together indiscriminately
without food or medicine; insults and
violence to prisoners by German sol
diers upon their arrival in Germany;
attacks upon French prisoners by wo
men at Erfurt with knives, sickles and
scytheH, tolerated by the escort; spit
ting upon and whipping of prisoners
by civilians and kicking of prisoners
by young German recruits as they fil
ed through Torgau; great ravages In
nearly all prison camps by tubercu
losis developed by neglect of most ele
mentary hygionic precautions; spread
of typhus among British and French
prisoners by mixing them with infect
ed Russians; general prevalence of
ABSOLVES FARMER
FROM ALL BLAME IN
Millard M. Myers.
With wheat on the high road to
the $2.50 mark, flour climbing to
wards $15 a barrel and bread costing
six cents for a small loaf, Millard M.
Myers, one of the closest students of
the, grain situation in this country,
absolves the farmer from all blame
for the high cost of living. "It looks
as if the speculator is to blame for
the increased cost of bread stuffs,"
loe declare?
rheumatism in all prison camps as the
result of dampness; iuforced labor of
prisoners of war on military works
such as trench digging, manufactur
ing of munitions, insufficient food,
shelter and clothing.
Prisoners in Tents.
Photographs of German camps are
offered to show the prisoners in mid
winter with only tents or dugouts for
shelter. It is charged that during tho
first winter in Germany large num
bors,Qf prisoners wore obliged to dig
themselves into the ground for shelter
or to construct mud huts and the
Spanish minister Is quoted in support
of this accusation. It Is admitted that
some improvement on these condi
tions have been made in certain
camps.
In regard to the question of nourish
ment, French surgeons and nurses
who have returned to France after
periods of captivity in Germany, re
port that tho insuffieucy of food cou
pled with other privations has result
ed in the spread of tuberculosis and
other diseases such as erysipelas,
scarletina and gastritis.
Crippled Soldiers Report.
Crippled soldiers returning to
France and the camps of Langensalad,
Langenzala, Castle Vlederwehren and
Wittenberg report that Russian pris
oners, carrying typhus contagion,
were scattered through the camps
starting an epidemic. They accuse the
German doctors of brutality to nurses
as well as neglect of typhus patients.
Men who died of the disease during
the night were said to have been left
lying among tho other prisoners un
til morning. .
At Wittenburg, according to the
sworn testimony of the returned sol
diers, the German authorities aban
doned the typhus stricken camp to its
own resources, which were nil. All
communication was cut off from the i
exterior. A narrow gauge railway was
iicor tr qIiovp Jnfn flip ramn tVir nrls-
oners' rations and coffins. Two thou
sand French soldiprs are stated to
have died of typhus at Cassel.
Forced Into Krupp Works.
The section of tho book which deals
with the inforced labor of the pris
oners of war charges that 1500 French
prisoners were forced to work In the
Krupp works at Essen. Several thou
sand it is also asserted, were sent to
Courland provinco in Russia, where
they were employed in building strate
gic railways.
The book concludes with a declara
tion by tho French government that It
has not, nor will it, resort to measures
of reprisal. The only modifications in
the treatment of German prisoners as
the result of these charges are, the
government says, the reduction of ra
tions and pay to the equivalent of the
German rations and pay and the with
holding of tho privilege of liberty on
parole, in reply to the same meascure
applied In Germany.

FRENCH PRESS I
HIGHLYPLEASED I
Wilson Election Assures Firm
Neutrality Vote Proves
People Against War.
DESERVED CONFIDENCE H
President Played Very Hon
: Honorable Role in Moments
of Grave Crisis.
Paris, Nov. 11, 5:35 a. m. The
French newspapers printing the news
of the American election in promi-1 IH
nent positions and make little editor
ial mention.
The Petit Journal says:
"President Wilson is highly satis
factory to us for two reasons: Tho
first is that four years of American
foreign policies will be free from all
electoral considerations, as the con- jH
stitution forbids President Wilson
from seeking a third term; the sec- IH
ond reason is that the result of the
election must put new life into Amer- jH
lean neutrality. Evidently an im
mense majority of tho electorate pro
nounced against war, but, apart from IH
the millions of voters who approved IH
the vigor with which the president
forced the Germans to cede on tho
submarine war questions, other mil- IH
lions voted for Hughes because he de
manded an even firmer defense of j
American rights. The chief executive i ijjjjjH
Is obliged to take into account this t
double wish. Just as Hughes could j JM
not have ignored the verdict against
war, so Wilson must take into con- IH
sideratlon the condemnation of a for
eign policy, which Roosevelt has char
acterized as 'backboneless.' "
Played Honorable Role.
The Matin and the Parisien express jH
the same view.
The latter paper concludes: , IH
"It is because he played a very hon
orable role In a moment of a grave IH
crisis that the American people have IH
renewed their mandate to President IH
Wilson. In 1912 he owed his election
to the division of his adversaries.
This time ho owes It to his prestige,
to his electoral campaign and to hie , IH
confidence which he deserved. It is IH
possible that his policy will now be
come firmer and clearer, that, profit- j
Ing by experience, he will aspire to '
play a larger role and to rise up as a J
more determined champion of the law j
of nations." Progressive votes given to
Wilson are given with the mental res
ervation that they will not go again jH
to a Democratic candidate unless Wil- IH
son confirms tho faith of the Progres
slves by consolidating what is still
only tentative. If he does that he will .
have established himself as the ablest I
statesman since Lincoln and lie may
be destined to play a part in the
achievement of peace which will give
him a place in world history."
