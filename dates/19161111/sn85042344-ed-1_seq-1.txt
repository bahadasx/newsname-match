ELECTION TO DECIDE
fwenty Votes Counted Yes
terday hut Six of These
Were Invalid.
TH 10 rare fur county aH.ips.sor was
lied liy tho mail vote which was
counted by thu eU'ctlon board yester
duy afternoon. When tho voting
within tho county was counted
Wednesday K. M. North, Republican
nominee for assessor, had 3,!92 votes
and W. S. Hooker, Democratic candi
date, had 3,!91, giving North a plu
rality of one vote. In the votes sent
by nail North received two and
Hooker three, bringing tho total of
each to 3,994 votes.
JuHt how the situation will be re
lieved Is uncertain. In former yenis
candidates who were tied for a par
ticular office settled the question by
tossing a coin. Hut this now ih in
violatli n of the state gambling law
and a candidate taking offico through,
such procedure would da so Illegally.
A special election seems the only
method of naming an assessor for
Tulsa county unless additional votes
are r reived by mail. This is consid
ered unlikely as all the mail votes
were cast In some part of Oklahoma
and have lied plenty of lime to reach
Tulsa If they were mailed Wednesday.
A oil's Were Important.
The Importance of mail voles In
demonstrated by tho deadlock In tho
contest for county assessor. Ono ad
ditional vcte for either candidate
would have swung' the election.
Many voters who were, out of the
city c n election day and who were
within the state neglected to vote.
Their ballots tnlfrhr-have prevented n
tie for county assessor.
Just what pet I on will bo taken re
garding tho county treasurer's race
also if mains problematical. Through
an erior In printing tho ballots the
nancs of candidates for this office
were omitted. In part of the pre
cincts the names of Kd Dalton, Demo
cratic naininee, and Claude Sample,
Itepuhlican nominee, wre written on
the ballots. But it Is certain mat nun
dreds of votes were lost by each can
didate through this error ami the re
sult is unsatisfactory. Dalton had a
plurality of the votes cast but Dalton
Is considering contesting the election.
Twenty by Mail.
Twenty' votes in all were received
by mail in this county The liters
cast tholr hallots for the presidential
electors and state officers In the regit
)ar way and had the privilege of sub
stituting the names of their home
county candidates for congressman,
representative in tho legislature, coun
ty and townshln offices. These were
forwarded by the elect! in officials In
the precinct wher. they voted to the
county election board here. Voters
bnlloUng in this way must be fully
qualified and cast their vote within
thf state of Oklahoma.
Six ballots wera rejected by the
election board Three of these' wete
declared void because they were not
accompanied by the voters' nffl.lavlts,
and Hire? others were not opened as
they were not sent by registered mall.
The stnte election law makes these re
quirements of persi.13 voting away
from home.

Why Republicans Lost the
Election
Tlure wasn't any part of the popu
lation in tbls country more surprised
over the result of Tuesday's election
than the leaders and managers of the
Democratic campaign. They won
whero they least expected and lust
where they fought hardest and had
but little hope of any more titan mak
ing a stand-off. To the public gen
t rally the result Is most astounding
nnd to the Republican leaders and
managers Is positively dumbfounding.
It will furnish food for discussion aii'l
thoughtful consideration until another
national election roduces material
for a moro subst intlnl and reliable
data upon which to base conclusions
as to the political complexion of the
valines states and sections of the
country nt large.
The I cmoiTat.s did not win Hum
election the Republicans just lest it,
without the Democrats doing a single
thing to carry It. It serves the Re
publicans Jolly well right. In the first
place it is quite certain that the !'.'
publican party has n"t recovered from
tht oisinlegrat inn resulting; from the
split over the national comcntlon four
years ago. Mr. Roosevelt was big
sj'iiough to knock the Republican or-
gtii'lMioii into a rocked hat, but he
was not enough to repair the dam
age and bring the discordant elements
together ncain. It was just another
instance of humpty-dumpty sitting on
the wall, humpty-ilum:ity getting n
great fall, b it all Hi" kitw's hones and
alt the king's men couldn't put
humpty-dumpty together again.
Apparently all the prominent and
influentiel leaders of the Hull Moose
party came beck Intifethe Republican
camp, but they came back alone. Mr.
Roosevelt was bigger than the Re
publican party in 1!H2, but he v.aa

NEW YORK, Nov. 10. With re
turns missing tonight from only
one congressional district in the
I'nlted States the Republicans anil
Democrats each had elected 215 rep
resentatives. The voto in New Mexico,
which is still in doubt, probably will

a Republican.
The balance of power In tho next

In MThing at a basis for comput

election board today said thai any
spoiled or challenged ballots would
riot be counted as voted ballots. When
111 receipt by the board today ot re
turns from 2."i counties there wan no
high vole set down In some of them,
The board sent orders to the county
hoard to make known the lotal num
ber of votes east In the county ucd
send It In.
For instance, the bonrd figured this
way In Atoka county There was a
"y s' vote on the election law of l,4tp;
and a "no" vote of 1.IIK4 Here is a
majority of 102 in favor of t lie aineml
inent. Adding the "yes' and "no"
votes It would give a total of 2. "10
votes cast on that question. Rut stato
Candidates In that county received as
high as 3.022 votes.
This the hoard reckons Is Die high
Vote in that county. Subtract 2,81111
Votes cast on (lie election law from

a difference of 192 silent votes which

This same condition is ahnwn in the

of the conditions stated the board jo
day cecllned to allow the "yes" and
"no" figures to be used unless 'lie

that as the affirmative and negative
