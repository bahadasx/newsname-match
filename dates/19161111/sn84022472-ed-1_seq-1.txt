He Says Must "!Be Regard

Confidential What Con
v - statutes Violation of Laws
. Covering Elections.
, Stories were definitely circu
lated today, that election work
ers, have sought Homer S. Gum
mings, state attorney for Fair
field county, with the purpose
. of making a clean breast of
their participation in the Voting
of Tuesday.
It was said that at least one
of these men is a Democrat who
had received payment to hustle
ffor the Republican ticket. " '
That United States District
. Attorney Thomas J. Spellacy
came to Bridgeport from Hart
ford today, became known here
this -afternoon. Mr. Spellacy
was known to have been in
Bridgeport, nut attempts to lo
cate him were unsuccessful. It
is assured that he is, here in
connection with the prbbe of
... Fairfield county, and especially
, Bridgeport election methods
' The announcement of Mr. Cum
mings that he proposes to investigate
the vote in' Connecticut, and. the're-
v markable Republican plurality in
Fairfield "county, has- caused many
persons tcf read the corrupt practices
act "With renewed interest.
v A scrutiny of the act shows that
many things are forbidden, which ap
pear to have been practiced.
It is for instance a criminal offense
to employ a man to hustle for a can
didate, or group . of candidates, for
pay. It is criminal to employ a large
number of persons outside the polls
who have no necessary dutieu to. per
form. (It is criminal to employ more
persons for the necessary work of the
polls than are necessary, or for an
unreasonably large compensation. ' i
' It is criminal to collect monoy with
out authorization or to pay money
to ar unauthorized person. '
The .method of buying votes which
is claimed to be most prevalent in this
part of Connecticut consists In em
ploying the prospective voter as a
"worker.'' The number of workers
employed, the work they did and the
amount pf their compensation, will, it
is said, form a mighty interesling fea
ture of : the investigation M' Cum
' mings is about to inaugurate.
It is a violation of the corrupt prac
tices act to hustle for candl dates in
consideration of a promiso of a job.
Some ' interesting facts are expected
to develop regarding the activities of
certain men, nominally Democrats,
who were active for the Republican1
ticket, for the reason, it is said, they
hoped to go on the police force.
Homer S. Cummings, when seen to
day at his office in the county court
house, was asked about, confessions
that had been made to him, said:
"It -would be most improper for me
to discuss this matter or any phase
pf it. - I am constantly receiving in
formation of one kind and another,
which for the present must be regard-
;ed as confidential." "
. Couldn't Resist
"Shoot a Nickel"
'Somebody said shoot a nickel as I
passed the game.' I just had a nick
l el, so I threw it on the sidewalk and
told him to shoot," said john.Beda
mie,' of 25 Hallett street, this morning
when arraigned in the city court on
a charge of shooting craps, with
James Gamberado, of - 33 Gilbert

- Gamberado was assessed, the same
! sum. Both men were arrested after

stealing a touring car, the property
of the garage owner, which he wrecked
the same evening at Barnum avenue

Since last August when the incident

No information was obtainable from
a reliable source as to the probable
time of sailing. Rumors spread that
the Deutschland would leave in the

and Captain Hilken, of the Eastern
F6rwarding Co., had- no success.
The impression .they received -was
that the craft would sail when the
right moment came, and that proba

fore those on shore were aware of
the fact of departure.- N :
The Deutschland is ready to leave.

Famous Hotel in Water St.
May Be Razed For De
velopments. Among the realty transfers of the
last fortnight, probably none is filled
with more memories of the past, both
pleasant and unpleasant, than the an
nounced sale of the Kaiserhof hotel
property, located at 715 Waterstreet,
and now occupied by Matt Wieler.as a
hotel.
The property has been purchased
by Edward Von Wettberg, of 140
Middle street, who stated today he
had acquired the property for future
development, the nature of which has
not been decided upon but added that
the old structure undoubtedly would
be razed.
For years the hotej was conducted
by George Wagner and throughout
New England and in New York city
the place had an excellent reputation
as Wagner's hotel and summer gar
den. Later, however, it developed
a less estimable standing when one
after the other several prominent men
committed suicide there and the place
became known as the home of the
Suicide club. ' From the name
"Gast-Haus," which the German
proprietor had styled his place, it be
came known as the "Gas House," be
cause most of the suicides adopted
this means of taking the short cut to
eternity.-
The building was erected in 1859
and,, was originally intended for a
store and tenement house. Its first
known tenant was John Wentworth of
New Milford, Who conducted an oyster
and eating house on the lower floor'
and used the upper v rooms for his
family renting a number to male

GREATEST LOAN
IN HISTORY OF
CITY EFFECTED
Bridgeport Savings Bank
Takes Over Securities in
The Stratfield.
The tide of prosperity which has
set steadily towards Bridgeport during
the last two years with, no indication
of ebb' brought today the most visible
signs of a golden financial era yet
thrown upon shores.
Announcement made in banking
circles disclosed that the - Bridgeport
Savings bank has taken up the securi
ties formerly held by the Mutual Life
Insurance Co. of New York city on
The Stratfield property, in Main
street between Golden Hill and
Chapel streets, amounting to half a
million dollars, and had Increased it
by $100,000.
In speaking of the big loan today,
which is the biggest ever made by a
savings bank in the city of Bridgeport,
and probably the biggest ever made
by a similar institution in the state of
Connecticut, Samuel M., Hawley, sec
retary and treasurer, said: "We be
lieve In Bridgeport real estate. Our
deposits come from the people of the
City of Bridgeport and our money is
going out to help develop real estate
in Bridgeport. I think we have now
shown that we are able to finance any
venture in Bridgeport." '
The last remark of Mr. Hawley's
statement is believed to refer to the
past.' History discloses that when
Samuel H. Wheeler first conceived the
idea of improving Main street between
Chapel and Golden Hill streets and
broached his hotel idea to local finan
ciers, it was impossible to raise $500,
000 in a lump. In consequence Mr.
Wheeler was obliged to seek capital
forhis venture, in New York. The
Mutual Life Insurance Co. loaned the
money on what is known as the Fox
properties with a frontage of 400 feet
in Main street and an average depth
of 250 feet, with nearly an equal
frontage in Chapel street to that in
Main.
With deposits rolling into the local
savings banks of this city during the
last two years, a complete change of
situation has resulted. Building of
much larger scope than heretofore
has. been -financed by bankers, . espec
ially ; the savings banks which have
sought to place their deposits in
Bridgeport rathef than elsewhere.
The Bridgeport Savings bank has
loaned largely upon one and two fam
ily houses, business blocks and other
structures, upwards of 200 in number.
Mr. Hawley stated today that the
present load, which upon its face dis
closes an expenditure of $600,000 in
reality representing & $2,000,000 in
crease in property values. This valua
tion is obtained upon the prevailing
standard of loaning only $50 upon the
appraised value of property.
It was further asserted by banking
officials that the present large loan
was accomplished without in the least
curtailing the extent of loans made or
to be made to regular borrowers or
prospective borrowers.
Loans made during the past fiscal
year of "the Bridgeport Savings bank,
ending Jan. 1, will, it is confidently
expected, aggregate "between 225 and
250 individual loans upon various
properties, with a probable aggregate
of more than $1,100,000, or about 100

Complete returns in New, Hampshire, showing a plurality
in ihat state for Wilson, bring the President's total electoral
votes to 273. t
Incomplete returns from New Mexico show the Presi
dent's lead there to be increasing. The state's three votes,
apparently certain for the President, will give him a total of
276 in the electoral college.
Hughes' lead in Minnesota is dwindling with all but 17
precincts reported. The soldiers' vote and the so-called ab
sentee vote will decide the issue in Minnesota.
There is little likelihoocl of California's electoral vote be
ing split, state leaders agree after studying the returns.
President Wilson, on incomplete returns, has received a
popular vote of 8,563,713; Hughes, 8,160,401. Wilson's plural

the Democratic, leaders today of the

be maintained throughout the state, ii
