Official Reports of Villa's Raids
in Mexico Will be Awaited by
Conferees
Atlantic City, N. J., Nov. 14.—Con
firmation of reports on the increased
strength of various reactionary move
ments in Mexico served to offset to
day the apparent determination of the
representatives on the Mexican-Amer­
ican joint' commission. Until official
reports reveal the truth of stories of
Villa's successes in the north and of
the progress made by other reaction
aries in the south, there appeared a
probability that an agreement would
be entered into, perhaps next week.
That appeared very likely today and
the chance that a formal adjourn­
ment without an agreement other
than that of a most general charac­
ter, Keemed more probable.
Reports received by the Americans
from official sources and others receiv­
ed by the Mexicans from their gov
ernment, dealing with the activities of
Villa, were studied today. The net
result of the comparison of the re
ports was to disclose that General
Carranza is now conducting a fiefens
ive campagn against Villa, with a bat­
tle at Escalon imminent, instead of
prosecuting a campaign against him
From the south comes a report, ac
cepted as reliable, that Felix Diaz's
forces are in possession of Rincon, a
station on the Tehuantepec railway.
Tbe capture of Jiminez, Santo Rosa

Republican Chiefs Confer With
Attorney General in Regard
to Irregularities
ONE PRECINCT RECOUNT
SHOWS GAIN FOR HUGHES
Believed Official Probe Might
Change Result in State
and Nation.
Republican^chiefs of North Dakota
were in conference yesterday with At­
torney General Iinde with regard to a
possible official probe of North Dako­
ta's vote in Tuesday's general elec­
tion. The attorney general when in­
terviewed yesterday refused to make
a statement, but did acknowledge that
the matter had been taken up with
him and that an investigation of some
kind was then under consideration. No
basis for suspecting irregularities in
connection with^ Tuesday's balloting
was given.
Might Change Result.
With New Mexico, West Virginia,
New Hampshire and Minnesota swing­
ing to Hughes, and leaving him only
seven votes behind Wilson, the nation­
al electors now stand divided as fol­
lows: Wilson, 269 Hughes, 262. The
possibility of a recount in North Da­
kota, therefore, assumes the most vital
importance for. should North Dakota
by any chance be given to Hughes, it
would make him president, with one
electoral vote to spare, while it would
reduce Wilson's total to 2G4, two short
of the sufficient number.
How Vote Stands.
Noith Dakota, with fifteen precincts
missing, gives Wilson 54,27.9 and
Hughes 53,164, a lead of only 1,115 for
the president. One recount already
made, in the Max precinct in McLean
county, has produced another vote for
Hughes. Should there be a similar
result in only half of North Dakota's
2,000 precincts, Wilson's lead would
be seriously endangered.
Technical Irregularities.
There have been technical irregu­
larities, which may not, however,
prove of serious consequence. In Dunn
county, for instance, no one knows the
vote in two precincts. After the bal
lotting was finished, the election board
is said to have locked up the bflllots
without counting them, and to have re­
turned the boxes to the county audi­
tor, with no official abstract of the
vote. It is claimed that court action
could be resorted to to compel the
election board to make and announce
its count, instead of waiting until the
official canvassing board meets some
days hence.
Abnormally Large Vote.
There is no question whatever that
Tuesday's vote was abnormal, even
for a state which is growing so rapid­
ly as is North Dakota. For Wilson
and Hughes, with fifteen precincts
missing, the total vote stands 107.443.
This is more than 7,000 greater than
the vote for governor in the same pre­
cincts, in spite of the fact that Lynn
J. Frazier is the best vote-getter who
ever has sought the gubernatorial
chair, and«that he had 50,000 Non-Part
isan league votes back of him. The
Non-Partisan league was not interest­
ed in the national election it made no
effort to get out a vote for either
Hughes or Wilson neither of these
candidates had any decided personal
following or unusual degree of popu­
larity in the state. Yet they polled
together 7,269 more votes than did
Frazier and McArthur.
Senatorial Vote Low.
As between the presidential and the
senatorial contests, the discrepancy
in the total vote is even more notable.
The fight between McCumber and
Burke was one of the real issues of
the campaign. McCumber had the
united strength of his party back of
him. Ilurke was an idol of the 'Dem­
ocrats and the only man in the his­
tory of North Dakota thrice elected
to the governorship. Yet, with all
their pulling power, they polled to*
gethcr but 96,334 votes, or 11,109 less
than were given Wilson and Hughes.
McCumber, at that, ran 2,600 votes
ahead of the leader of his national
ticket, but John Burke, the native
son. rati 14,000 votes behind Wilson.
Big Gain Over Primaries.
Last June North Dakota staged the
hottest primary election in its his­
tory. There were real contests for
nominations on both the Republican
and Democratic tickets, and the to-1 j,ecause
States senate was 83.3R8
less than cast by members of two par­
ties for president last Tuesday. The
Republican vote last June was,
course, abnormal. In selecting
candidate for the United States sen­
ate, «8,ssr. ballots were cast. There
was nothing abnormal in the Demo­
cratic vote for Burke and Hellstrom,
which totaled only 13,436. In the sen­
atorial contest, 13,121 supposed Re­
publicans who voted for McCumber
or Hanna or one of the other Repub­
lican candidates in June, did not vote
for the Republican nominee last Tues­
day. The returns would indicate that
Burke garnered these 13,121 votes
from the Republicans and the support

NORTH DAKOTA VOTE
New York, Nov. 7—It seems resonably sure now on the face of
the returns that President Wilson has 269 votes in the electoral
college as against 262 for Hughes.. All states have practically been
eliminated from the doubtful column. While Minnesota is excru.
ciatingly close, Wilson's lead can hardly be overcome.
New Hampshire, New Mexico and West Virginia seem safely for
Hughes now.
A change in four electoral votes in favor of Hughes would
leave Wilson one vote short of the 266 necessary to elect.

EARTH MOVEMENTS WILL

Washington, Nov. 10.—The predic­

Panama canal will be overcome "fin­

eral of the Canal Zone, in his annual
report made public today by the war
department: This will be accomplish­

amity howlers, and in spite of the
disastrous prediction of the 'know-it

Referring to the slides, the general
says he is moved to go into the sub­
ject again only because of the many
false reports that have been publish­
ed.
"Such reports are false and there is
no foundation for them," he declared,
"yet they seem to have gained credit

Scanning Results.
Republican leaders are carefully
scanning results in every state where
the contest is close.. North Dakota is
one of them under scrutiny, owing to
the differences between the vote cast
for president and cast for the state
ticket. California is holding chief in*
terest and a thorough canvass of the
vote will be made there.
California politicians settled down
tonight for a vigilant surveillance of
the official count by county clerks and
the final count by the secretary of
state.
California Vote.
All further proceedings, leaders of
both parties agreed, will hinge on
what develops in these counties. At 8
o'clock tonight, Wilson's lead in the
state was 3,286 votes with only 18 pre*
cincts to be heard from.
Both Republican and Democratic!
leaders agreed that these precincts
would not alter the results materially.:
Won't Concede Election.
Legal counsel has been retaiqed by
both Republicans and Democrats to
aid in watching the final count.
Worn out by the tensipn of waiting
for the returns from doubtfUl'stateA,
which would determine whether he
had been elected to the presidency,
Charles E. Hughes retired at 9 o'clock
tonight. He spent the day at his' het4l,
texcept for a two-hour automobile lid*
with his wife this afternoon.
Mr. Hughes has not yet conceded
tbe election of President Wilson and
probably wi|l not do so until the vote
of close states has been officially
counted.
Discover Errors.
Discovery of errors togay in official
returns further clouded the outcome
of the New Hampshire vote for presi­
dential electors.
Secretary of State Dean announced
in his final statement of the day, with
five of the 294 precincts missing, the
certified count was:
Hughes 43,422.
Wilson, 43.098.
This gives Hughes a lead of 324.
He pointed out, however, that these
figures included the Hughes vote In
two precincts, the clerks of which had
failed to credit Wilson with any votes
in their certificates. In each Instance
the clerks later admitted that an er­
ror had been made. 1
The latest returns on president in
Minnesota, made it: 3,008 precincts,
Wilson 177,534 Hughes 178,017
Hughes' plurality 503. Only 38 pre*
cincts are missing.
The total popular vote received In
