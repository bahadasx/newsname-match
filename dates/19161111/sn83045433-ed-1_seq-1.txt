PROHIBITION CAUSE
"Dry" Leaders Predict Planks Will Be
Adopted in Near Future.
(8y the Interastional News Service.)
New York, Nov. 10.-With twenty-four
States in the "dry" column. antl-zaloon
propagandists today predicted that the
state of the movement would lead either
the Republicans or Democrats to adopt
a prohibition plank in their platform.
The victories of the prohibitionists in
Michigan. Nebraska. Montana, and South
Dakota on Tuesday is attributed largely
to the good eampaign work of the women.
"We carried every State where we ex
pected to win," said Edward A. Packer,
New York County chairman of the na
tional Prohibition party. "We did not ex
pect to win in Missouri. When the full
returns are available It is certain that
they will show an enormous gain. Pro
hibitionists are not wedded to the Pro
hibition party, and they would like to
see the movement adopted by one of the
two dominant parties. I would vote either
the Republican or Democratic ticket if
it carried a prohibition plank and I
believe all other prohibitionists would do
the same."

aa
New York, Nov. 10.-Three States. Scat
tered over almost the entire width of
the country, tonight still made ImPOSSi
ble exact computation of the plurality in
the Electoral College by which President
Wilson was elected. They were New
Hampshire with four electoral votes.
Minnesota with twelve, and New Mexico
with three.
New Hampshire and Minnesota. from
the trend of 'the late returns, appeared
safe for Wilson.- Added to the 272 elec
toral votes already counted in his col
umn these 16 raise the President's total
to 2811. New Mexico already has been in
eluded in the previous total of 272.
Errors in oficlal certificates of the re
turns which fa!led to credit votes cast
far Democratic electors held the total In
New llamlshire in doubt. But unofficial
estimates by Secretary of State Bean
mive the lead in the State to Wilson
by the narrow margin of 70. With five
districts missing the vote stood Hughes,
t3.422, against the President's 43,0K. This
gave the Republican candidate a lead of
124. but Democratic electoral votes not
reported and gains In other precincts
served to overcome this lead.
In Minnesota the Hughes lead of 50
was fast being cut down. .In the last
eight precincts counted the Republican
candidate had lost 252. The Democratic
State Committee was confilent that the
"absentee vote"-traveling and railroad
men, who vote by mail-and the border
vote, will wipe this out and give Wilson
a safe margin.
New Mexico ha. sixty-seven missing
districts, with a vote of 3,00. to be heard
rrom. With those missing the President's
plurality was 2.319.
