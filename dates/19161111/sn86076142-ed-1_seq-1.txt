(Br Aaaoelated Preaa.)
NEW YORK, Nov. 11. With re
turn! missing last night from only
one congressional . district in the
United States, the Republicans and
Deomcrati each had elected 215 rep
resentatives. The vote in New Mex
ico, which U still in doubt, probably
will determine which party is to have
a plurality of one over the other.
The present member from New Mex
ico Is a Republican.
The balance of power in the next
bouse will be held by four men, one
progressive-protectionist from Lou
isiana, one an Independent from
Massachusetts, one a Progressive
from Minnesota and the other a So
cialist from New York. Their action
apparently will determine the choice
of a speaker as well as the fate of
legislation which is supported or op
posed on purely party lines.
In addition to the hope of electing
a congrssman at large from New
Mexico, the Democrats had one grain
of comfort last night It was that
an official count may disclose that
Thomas J. Scully has been re-elected
from the third New Jersey district,
They contended the chances , were
that Scully .had been the victor by
few votes over Robert Carson, hit
Republican opponent, to whom the
election previously had been , con.
ceded by a narrow margin.

ATLANTIC CITY, N. J., Nov. 11.
Confirmation of reports of the in
creased strength of various reac
tionary movements in Mexico served
to offset yesterday the apparent de
termination of the representatives on
the Mexican-American joint commit
tee to effect an early adjustment of
the problems the two governments
are facing. ; Until official reports re
veal the truth of stories of Villa's
successes in the north and of the
progress made by other reactionaries
in the south, there appeared a prob
ability that an agreement woold be
entered into, perhaps next week.
That appeared less like yesterday
and the chance that a formal adjourn
ment without agreement other than
one of the most general character
seemed more probable.
Reports received by the Americans
from official sources and others re
ceived by the Mexicans from their
government, dealing with the activi
ties of Villa, were studied at the con
ference. The result of the compari
son of the reports was to disclose
that General Carrahsa is now con
ducting a defensive campaign against
Villa, with a battle at Eacalon Im
