B N U If
AT HOME
The. Teutonic Empire probably
has the most efficient secret
service system in the ivorld.
Some of the police methods
are described in this article.
lIAT Is n spy? Although It Is
well known that the spy sys
tems of the warring nations
nro very potential nnd of the
most far-rsnchlng nature,
very few persons outside of
the secret or so-called "f.py"
service know anything about the actual
work of the secret organizations. In
Germany and In Jnpnn tho secret serv
icu work 1ms reached the highest stato
ot perfection, suys n writer In tho New
York Tribune.
How n person becomes n spy and
how he or she afterward cnrrles out
the work depend upon tho group of se
cret workers that the novice Is Intro
duced to or throtvn In contact with
through circumstances.
The volunteer or sclf-nppoluted spy
Is not to bo considered In the following
account, but merely tho professionals
or accredited Investigators.
Germany has four classes of "splo
nen," oh they are called In the vernacu
lar, but never ofliclnlly. The system
comprises (1) the emperor's private
staff, about CO men and 0 women;
(2) the War Olllee staff, which now
numbers 0,000; CD tho government
secret service, about D00 olllccrs nnd
8,000 men and 180 women, and finally
the (4) "gehelmpnllzel" or secret
police, who are similarly situated ns
tho American police detectives, but far
moro efllclenr, nnd their number Is
legion. Then there is a small contin
gent nttnehod to embassies and lega
tions. Almost without exception the first
tlireu groups comprise persons who
Aave evolved Into tho secret service,
it Is very seldom that nn adult person
steps from any "open" occupation Into
the work. An endless chain is con
stantly being forged. When spies die,
and they often do In other wnys thun
tho nntural, thero are always assist
ants thut nro ready to step Into their
boots. These recruits uro "graduates
and have gone through the preliminary
training course that Is probably de
scribed hero now for tho first time.
The "students" nro first given thor
ough tests for hearing, sight and men
tal activity. These tests are similar to
those used by tho railroads. Each
morning n system of tho most extraor
dinary calisthenics Is practiced. One
of tho most curious tilings Is the side
twist of the head, which' Is practiced
so long that tho graduate can place
his or her chin against tho point of
tho right shoulder nnd remain in that
position for u long while. This enables
tho spy to stand with the enr against a
wnll or n door and listen for hours
without getting n stilt nock and
fatigue. To stand motionless for hours,
to walk over n creaking lloor without
making a noise, to walk on creaking
i stairs noiselessly nnd to Insert keys, to
unlock doors In silence are some of tho
stunts practiced. The most treacher
ous stairways are negotiated by walk
ing close to tho walls, nnd the noisy
lloor plank Is mastered by a gradual
and firm pressing motion. Tho cross
beams ot n floor nro easily located by
l the experienced, nnd aro usually stable
I nnd silent.
! It Is wonderful what the noises In a
' wall In even tho most silent house will
reveal. The spy Is taught to eliminate
tho obvious sounds. Ho presses the enr
j Hat against tho wnll ; plaster Is better
j than wnll paper, but solid wood Is
' good, nnd a thin door panel Is still
better, provided the door llts snugly
nnd 1ms good support.
1 Graduates that understand vnrlous
langunges nro much In demand, nnd
yet each country prefers a native born.
The members of the secret service nro
seldom armed, but when weapons aro
required they prefer tho ammonia pis
tol, as It is silent, does not kill, but dis
ables the victim by blinding 1dm for a
short period, and It can be used nt any
distance up to CO feet.
A full-Hedged spy nlso carries the
"signal," tho open sesame of every
thing German. Tho signal has perhaps
never been seen by mi outsider. It Is
u silver framed shield about as lurgo
as the palm ot tho hand, with a black
velvet ground on which Is embossed In
sliver the great Prussian englo on ono
side and tho "V. II." on the other, for
"Wllhelm II." It also has a small num
ber, according to tho possessor. This
"Signal" Is shown only In tho most ex
treme cases, and will carry the hearer
past any sentinel or bodyguard even
up to tho emperor's personal ulds and
himself, If necessary.
Tho shadowing spy also carries n

piece of flexible celluloid or nn ordl- i
nary photographic 111m which mnkes
nn Idenl telephom- muffler, speaking
trumpet or listening cone when rolled
up. Also, the confetti "pntronon" or
cartridges that prove so essentlul In
trailing nro frequently used. These
small cartridges tilled with white, pink
or pnlo blue confetti or small pieces
of paper and n small piece of mirror
glass form important paraphernalia to
the spy that has to keep closely to his
quarry for miles after miles of crowd
ed streets or from trolley cars to trains
nnd even through tho mnzes of busy
office buildings, ns the following will
show.
To tho outsider these tricks of the
profession mny seem childish and ex
treme. Yet tho Wllhclmstrnsso brains
of tho great Imperial secret service
prefer those methods nnd they prove
tho most efficient nfter all.
After making sure that ho carries
his regular equipment the spy goes to
his olllee or rendezvous for his dally
assignment, unless ho has an unflnlsh
ed tusk that requires no further in
structlons. Cafes or cigar stores are
tho best places. From a waiter or at
tendant or some lounging customer he
receives verbnl orders or Inforiuntlon
that reveals his day's task. Spies, be
causo of the nature of their work and
their personal peculiarities, aro never
trusted beyond their dally task.
For Instance, ono morning the sleuth
Is to meet a colleague at a certain
bank for tho purpose of observing the
doings of two foreigners that nro sus
pecteil of being ammunition ngents.
Sleuth A follows ono man. At tho
next street corner the man turns and
hi- trailer also turns, nnd In so doing
streaks tho wall of tho building with a
peculiar purple chalk, of a color not
used generally. Ho keeps on following
his man and at every corner ho marks
tho building so deftly nnd so inconspi
cuously that n bystander does not no
tice It. As long ns tho object keeps
walking straight ahead the trailer only
marks ono side of tho corner, but If
the object turns he marks both sides of
tho corner, showing Hint he has turned
to tho right or left. If then the object
should board n car, tho sleuth will
crush ono of tho white confetti car
tridges with his lingers nnd the persis
tent little pieces of paper full to the
street and stick In the crevices between
tho cobblestones or tho paving blocks,
or even cling tenaciously to tho as
phalt, defying both sweepers and
brooms for hours. If the object changes
cars tho trailer will drop a pink cluster
of confetti and the chalk murks will
tell tho story us they alight.
When the sleuth Is relieved that eve
ning he does not have to leave ills ob
ject out of his sight. Tho sleuth that
relieves him will merely tuke up the
thread from tho bank and will, ns n
rule, In Incredibly short time locate his
man In any part of tho city. This is
much more easily done In European
cities, as the streetcar systems ore not
so intricate and tho streets nre usually
paved with cobblestones or bricks. The
telephone Is not so readily nvallnblo
abroad. In Berlin, for Instance, thero
are the most pretentious homes nnd
thousands of shops und stores without
telephones.
When the chalk mark Is missing the
second or relay sleuth Is convinced
that his predecessor on the ensu or tho
present incumbent of tho case Is In tho
block. Ho walks back after making
certain that be did not tuke a car nt
that point, which would be revealed by
tho confetti on the ground. If tho ob
ject and tho trailer aro In the block
they will be soon seen or a Hock ot
confetti will show near the entrance
These means nre not always avail
