ELECTION TOTAL

tary Holler Today
LOAN- JITNEY COUNTED
Must Decide Whether Tickets
Can Be Counted Before
November 24
Official computation of the vote cast
in Harrisburg on tlie new high school
loan and the jitney amendment ques
tions were, completed to-day, but it
is doubtful if the complete returns for
the city's electors will be totaled until
Friday, November 24.
And this is because the "soldier
vote," the ballots cast on the faraway
Mexican Border by Harrisburg's
fighters in Uncle Sam's army, may not
be included in the total until then.
The official results of the balloting
in the city on the two questions ac
cording to the computation to-day fol
lows:
For. Against.
High school loan .... 6,553 4.295
Jitney amendment . . . 7.062 6,097
The "soldier vote" incidentally was
received from the election officers at
El Paso to-day by Prothonotary Harry
F. Holler. Additional Law Judge S. J.
M. McCarrell who is presiding at the
official count, said he is not ready to
decide upon just what construction he
shall place on the ninteenth section of
the act providing for the method of
casting and computing the soldier
vote, insofar as it might pertain to
the time for considering the returns
on the loan and jitney problems. .
The section in question provides,
that "the return judges of the several
counties shall adjourn to meet at the
places, now directed by law on the
third Friday after any general or pres
idential election for the purpose of
counting the soldier vote."
Judge McCarrell will decide whether
or not this shall be construed to mean
that the count of the vote from the
border is to be held until the third
Friday for the counting.
The tabulating of the long tables
will probably be finished before the
board rises this evening although it
is possible that the totaling and com
paring of the columns of figures will
not be finished by Clerks B. F. I'm
berger and B. F. Nead for several days
and probably a week or more.
W Bridal Pair Pay Election
Bet on Very First Returns
Washington. D. C.. Nov. 11.—Neither
Miss Martha C." Hanby nor Frederick
C. Ditmars lost their election bet. And
it is to be doubted if the election re
turns means much to either to-day. It
Is not recorded who made the propo
sition. but it read this way:
"If Hughes wins the election, I'll
marry you right away. If he loses,
we'll waft a long, long time."
Tuesdav night they watched the re
turns. It certainly looked like Hughes
to the principals in this particular
election bet. And since there wasn't
any loser, nobody was glum. On the
contrary, both smiled. It looked like
a sure thing that night, and since it
had all been decided, neither of the
two winners bothered with the re
turns Wednesday morning. There
wero other things to arrange, for early
in the forenoon the bet was paid and
they were married.
Tli" ceremony took place in McKen
drce Methodist Episcopal Church. The
bride's parents, her sister and two
nieces were present. Afterward Mr.
and Mrs. Ditmars left for Philadel
phia.

that the Russians were approximately

Fierce Battle Raging
For Possession of the
Great Tehernavoda Bridge
London. Nov. 11,—The news that
• fighting is auain in progress around
the groat Tehernavoda bridge in the
I Dobrudia recion of Rumania is the
j most interesting itrm of this morning's
; war news. The Russian official com
munlcation reports thnt Russian in
, fantry ai)d cavalry have occupied
Dunnreav' station, on the west side of
the Danube two miles from Teherna
voda.
This is the first news that the Bul
ear-German forces have crossed the
main stream of the Danube. The river
barrier at this noint is not merely the
of the stream, but, as the map
shows, a wide exnanse of marshes,
measuring more than twelve miles,
which i = the total length of the bridge.
\Vot of Dunareav Is a stretch of ten
mile* of swamn which is crossed bv no
read except the brirlire viaduct, and it
is obvious that military operations in
this must he of a most delicate

j When, in the days to come, the present ancient, more or less decrepkl and
! wholly inadequate bridge across the Susquehanna at Walnut street is flnallv
' removed to make way for a modern, stalwart and adequate viaduct, the build"-
j e.rs might well take a tip from the lowa State Highway Commission as a
; builder of bridges. In the accompanying etchings the Telegraph reproduces a
; view of an old—and a new bridge—which crosses one of the main waterways.
• Instead of the old more or less ugly network of Iron and steel girders and
; trusses, a trim concrete structure with broad caving spans, wide open roadway
| and spacious walks was constructed.

the description of W. L. Hcadrick,

ard read In the Harrisburg Telegraph
of the escape of the two prisoners,
Headrlclt and Howard, and that a re
ward of SSO each had been offered for
their capture. Obtaining a descrip
tion of both, he found that one of
these corresponded with that of the
man who remained at his home over

Authorities at Dauphin and residents
of the town were notified at once and
the Dauphin correspondent of the

stranger who fell over on the railroad
tracks. Tills morning his condition
was improved and he left. He had
dark hair, blue eyes, disfigured fingers,
the end of his left thumb had been cut
off, and he was wearing a browft suit.
Other parts of the description cor
responded entirely wtih that of Head
rick. whose left thumb is missing.

Willcox still awaiting the official count in close states before con
ceding the defeat of Charles E. Hughes in the national election the
latest returns to-day in the close states of California. Minnesota,
New Mexico and New Hampshire still presented on* their face no
change affecting the President's majority in the electoral college.
Mr. \\ ilson still leads in California, New Mexico and apparently
New Hampshire and Mr. Hughes in Minnesota, with only a few dis

President Wilson in Williamstown, Mass., was reported to be
chiefly concerned over the complexion of the next Congress which
was still in doubt to-day.
The President's plurality over Mr. Hughes in the total popular
vote, according to the latest estimates, based upon the incomplete
returns, is -403,312. Mis total vote was 8,563,713 and that of Mr!
Hughes 8,160,401.
