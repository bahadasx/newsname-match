eer. after it was demonstrated that
they had come as friends. Before
that a few stones hud been thrown at
them ami a shot or two fired. No
one was Injured.
General Pershing said some supplies
had been purchased in Chihuahua
but the limited amount made it
almost impossible to get provisions.
The excellent work done by the
aeroplanes has been so marked that
headquarters officials are anxiously
awaiting reinforcement of that arm
of the service. General Pershing's
reports imlicata that the live still in
service are doing good work in scouting
and carrying dispatches.

; thinks it will ho a long time before
| the child labor bill can come up in
the senate. Now pressing that Body
for consideration are the naval, rural
credits and ship purchase bills, in addition
to all the appropriation bills
and others, including the President's
policy. These will render almost impossible
any early consideration of
child labor, and there are chances
that It will go over Into the next sea

IN NO WAY R ESPOSIBLE FOR
SINGING OF BRITISH STEAMER
SUSSEX.
Announcement is Made From Kaiser's
Government.?Investigation Has
Been Completed.
Berlin, via London.?The German .
Government is able to announce that
no German submarine or warship was
responsible for the explosion which
damaged the British steamship Sussex.
I
When Germany on April f? handed i
I Aiiumssiuior ueraru an interim note
I replying to the inquiries of the United
States Government regarding the
Sussex and four other steamers the
matter of responsibility was still in
doubt and the investigation still was
proceeding. The German Foreign
Office, appreciating the agitation in
the United States over these cases,
transmitted an interim response declaring
the readiness of the govern- j
ment, should the Sussex prove to I
have teen destroyed by a German torpedo
boat contrary to the understand- j
Htg with the United States, to make ,
alUxeparation, including the payment
of compensation.
The Associated Press was informed
| authoritatively that the investigation
| lias now been completed, that all the
. craft which possibly might have been
involved in an attack on the Sussex i
have reported; that from iho reports
of their commanders it Is absolutely
certain that the Sussex was not destroyed
by a German torpedo, and
! that Germany is in no wise responsible
for the disaster.
From the material at hand it also
will be impossible to reply to the
American inquiries regarding the
steamers Englishman, Manchester
Engineer. Eagle Point, and Berwindvale,
and establish, according U) the
German contention, that no blame attaches
to Germany.
DARING ROBBERY OF BANK
Oanonsburg. Pa.?Detectives scour|
ed the hills in the vicinity of Houston,
i one mile west of here, in a vain effort
j to find the two men who robbed First
I National Hank of Houston of $15,000
! and escaped in an automobile. The
cashier was alone in the bank at the
time.
Shortly after noon two men entered
the bank and one laid a piece of paper
about the size of a check on the counl
ter in front of the cashier. On the pa|
per was written, "Make a move and
I you will be shot." When McNutt looked
up two revovlers were leveled at
j him. While one of the men guarded
j the cashier the other took about $15.i
000 in bills from the vault, leaving
' $?.,000 in gold and stiver untouched,
i Both then hurried out of the building
and jumped into an automobile which
they had left standing in front of the
bank.

to persistent reports that the

SENATOR SIMMONS SAYS TWO ,

National Guard Needs More Help (
From Federal Government But
Not a Competitor.
I
I
Washington. ? Senator Simmons,
who is opposed to the volunteer army | '
section of the Chamberlain bill, said |
that the proposed new force would be
practically a duplicate of the National
Guard. "Experience will show, if
they are both adopted," he said, 'that
it will not be long before either one
will swallow up the other or they will
both helplessly disorganize each
other."
"The volunteer army provided in J
the 55th section of the bill, by what- (
ever name it may be called, whether
a volunteer army or a continental <
army, is in essence and in substance
nothing more than a national militia.
"The National Guard as it exists
under the present law. by whatever
name it may be culled, is in ^essence
and in substance nothing except the
old state militia a little more closely
connected with the Federal treasury.
"So Mr. President, we have an
amendment here which will in effect
establish two national militia systems,
one absolutely controlled by the
Federal government in all its details,
in all its functions, and in all its operations.
and the other under certain
conditions and circumstances equally )
subject to the control of the Federal ;
government.
"If this federalizing process is con-1
aiuuniiimi, ne saia, "inero will bo
substantially little difference between
the national ntilitia called by the
name of a volunteer army and this
quasi-National militia called by the
name of the National Guard.
"I do not believe that the proposed
Federal volunteer army, compared
with the federalized National Guard
as a result of discipline and training
and control directly in the one case
and indirectly in the other case, will,
in all probability, result in giving us
any better training and system provided
for the same purpose in the
provisions of the bill with regard to 1
the National Guard."

MTION WEAK FOR
LACK OF NITRATES
SENATOR SMITH OF 8. C. DECLARES
UNITED STATES IS
TOTALLY UNPREPARED.
ROTABLE CAY IN CONGRESS
Senator Underwood Said for Lack of
Nitrates a Second Class Power
Could Make Us Surrender.
Washington.? Debate In Congress
>n various proposals for the erection |
if a government plant for the fixation
if atmospheric nitrogen occupied a
whole day. The pending amendment
was that of Senator Smith of South
Carolina to appropriate $15,000 for a
plant, site and process to lie determined
by the war department. The
surplus capacity over t.he government's
needs in peace times, under
the proposal, would go into the manufacture
of fertilizer to be sold by the
government through tne secretary of
tgriculture.
Senator Hardwick of Georgia attacked
this phase of the amendment
ss socialistic. He declared himself
unalterably opposed to embarking the
government on any such venture.
Senator Smith said he had framed
the amendment with the purpose of
reducing the cost of fertilizer to the
fanner because by n happy circumstance.
the government's military
needs and those of the farmer could
lie met at the some time.
Th* U?ropeun war was not an unmixed
evil, said tn* South Carolina
senator, as It had convinced <>?? people
that the United States was totaliv
unprepared on sen or land to face what
may he before it. He declared that
the basis of all modern warfare was
nitric acid and yet no s'ep hail been
taken to Insure an adequate supply.
GSermanv's successful resistance, he asserted.
was due to the fact that she
had foreseen the need of using atmospheric
nitrogen and developed a way
to procure it.
"This vast expense we are contem
plating for the army and navy." Senator
Smith said, "will be absolutely
useless if we are cut off from our supply
of nitrates."
Senator Lodge also attacked the
project but addressed himself partially
to the amendment offered by
Senator Underwood of Alabama,
which would provide for a war department
investigation of the question of
water-power sites and the process tt
be used.
Senator Underwood asserted thai
his amendment favored no specific pro
jeet but only sought a full invest Iga
tion of the subject.
"There is not a senator here." said
OfIIMIDI" I IHHTWOOfl. " WHO HOPS UOl
realize the deplorable conditions thin
country would be In because of short
tago of nitrates for explosives if war
should be declared against us. A second
rate power could make us surrender
In six months if we had no
surplus of nitrogen and it had plenty."
