SILVER STRENGTH
TOLD By LOli
In view of the recent sharp rise in
silver the following partial explana
tion contained in the weekly report
of Samuel Montague & Co., London,1
will prove of interest:
Demand for the British home mint
has been the chief factor, although
there has not been much pressure
from that quarter. The continent has
been more or less a constant buyer,
and a few orders have emanated from
the Indian bazaars.
"The closeness of the China ex
change to parity, the absence of free
selling from the United States, the
mintage by Japan on account of Rus
sia and the extension of the area in
which the Indian rupee has to do duty,
namely, to Mesopotamia, Egypt, and
East Africa, as well as the readjust
ment of currency in India itself, create
a feeling of confidence as to the fu
ture of the market.
"The Important statement Is made
that large amount of sovereigns are
being melted down throughout India
to make good the falling off in the Im
ports of gold bullion. The effect of
this has been to create a decrease in
the circulating medium, which may
have to be made good by the end of
the year by the increased coinage of
rupees. It is estimates that about 20,
000 to 25,000 sovereigns are being
melted down in India every day for
the last eighteen months, and this
must have created a fairly large gap
in the amount of money In circula
tion." GYPSIES REFUSED LICENSE
Four auto loads of Gypsies reached
Tonopah this morning from Goldfleld
where they were invited to leave ow
ing to several minor robberier. Chief
Evans told the leader of the band that
they could not secure a license here
and ordered thein to move on. He
warns householders to be careful In
dealing with the visitors. The Gyp
sies are headed for Ely.
