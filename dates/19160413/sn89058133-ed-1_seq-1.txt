TOBACCO
Winston-Saiem, N. C, Now Manufae
tures More Tobacco Products Than
Any Other Cly in the World.
- Following are extracts from an ad
dress delivered by Col. A. D. Watts,
Collector of Internal Revenue for the
Fifth District of North Carolina, at a
smoker lven by The Twin City Club,'
Winston-Salem, February 4th, 1916:
"Winston-Salem is supplying one
fourth of all the chewing and smok-'
ing tobacco consumed in the United
States, besides exporting vast quanti
ties to foreign lands. This statement
is taken from the report of the Com
missioner of Internal Revenue for the
first quarter of the present fiscal year
and from private advices from Wash
ington, as to the second quarter,
which ended December 31st, last.
Your city is making one-seventh
of all tobacco products chewing and
smoking tobacco, cigars, cigarettes
and snuff manufactured In the Unit
ed States. Your manufacturers are
paying on an average about $37,000
a day revenue taxes to the govern
ment and the amount is Increasing
from month to month. When your '
government building, much the hand
somest in the State, was completed
last July at a cost of $250,000 your
newspapers made the statement that
the taxes paid in your city to Undo
Sam for the first eight days of its oc
cupancy would pay for it. Since Sep
tember, it has taken only a fraction
over seven average days collections
here to equal its cost. So far this
week, Mr. Cranford has taken ' In
$206,428.50 I predict that before 1910
shall have ended your average week
ly payments to the government on to
bacco will more than pay for this
magnificent building, leaving the col
lections for the other flftfy one weeks
as clear profit to the government,
"Winston-Salem is shipping on an
average each week day to alt parts of
thia country and to foreign lands at
least $150,000 of tobacco, products. ,
"In conclusion, Winston-Salem man
ufactures more tobacco, all ' tobacco
products are taken into : this state
ment, than any other city on earth,
little or big. Industrially, she is eas
ily first in North' Carolina, population
considered, first in America and I be
lieve, in the world; socially, a never
failing delight to her 'riends."
