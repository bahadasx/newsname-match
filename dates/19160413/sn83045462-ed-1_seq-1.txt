are being discussed pursuit of Yi
with even greater vigor.
The most serious phase of the
cd here, was the charge*of bad fait
to the entry of JJnited States troc
and his bandits.
The Carranza note raises a ne'
plex, and officials are loath to dis
affair until they have gone over

Administration Is Facing
Most Serious Problem Yet
in Connection With Mexico
With President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing today sitting tight on the request
of Carranza that American troops
be withdrawn from Mexico, there was i
nobody authorized to intimate what the
decision of the administration will be.
An authority -close to the President,
however, expressed the belief that the
American forces will be withdrawn only
on conditions suitable to the administration
and when the President and his
advisers deem it best to do so.
It was candidly admitted that the administration
is hanl against the knottiest
problem concerning Mexico it has ;
yet had to deal with. Whatever action I
it takes is sure to arouse strong criticism.
If it refuses to withdraw the j
troops until it is fully satisfied that i
Villa's influence has been broken, his
forces taught a sharp lesson or the
bandit himself captured, thereby defying
Carranza, intervention and years
warfare are regarded as inevitable.
< ?n the other hand, if the position is
taken that the work set out to do has
iifen practically completed, although
Villa is still at large, and that the
roops will be withdrawn shortly, sharp
riticism from all parts of the country
is just as inevitable.
President Wilson entered the White
House over three years ago with the
determination that he would not let
anything cause the shedding of American
blood in Mexico. He has tried
hard to keep that promise to himself,
his friends pointed out today, but he
has been so sorely tried that it may
iiot be possible for him longer to take
action that will avoid intervention.
Position of the President.
The position that will be taken by
ihe President will depend largely upon
reports that are received from army
officers composing the punitive expedition
in Mexico, it was suggested today.
If they are disposed to regard their
mission as having been succesrui their
view would go far toward influencing
the administration, but it was certain
today, from all intimations, that the
President is not going to hasten compliance
with the request of Carranza.
In the meantime, however, it is recognized
that Carranza'fl action will surely
arouse ill feeling throughout Mexico
and all along the border, making for
outbreaks and threatening attacks upon
the thin line of American troops far
down In the interior of Mexico.
The administration must determine
as quickly as possible what its purpose
will be, so that thorough protection
can be given the soldiers of this
country and the lines of communication
with them. Assuming that Carranza
is not bluffing, and the President
decides the soldiers are to continue
their work, it will become Immediately
necessary that further troops shall be
sent to the aid of those in Mexico and
on the border. This within itself might
embitter the Carranza people and lead
them to the conclusion that they must
strike at once, thus starting the war
that army officers say would last for
many years and cost the United States
half a billion dollars or more.
Additional Forces Must Be Sent.
The presumed attitude of the administration
that the troops must remain
w here they are, analyzed along
w ith t'arranza's demand and evident Intention
to attempt to enforce his request,
if necessary, places the War De
partment in position, it was said, where
additional forces must be sent to the
border if not into Mexico. No official
of that department wishes to see
American soldiers butchered in Mexico
by overwhelmingly superior forces,
and the natural efforts of both the
army and Carranza's army will be to
increase their forces, the tenseness of
things increasing every minute and
needing only a spark to set off the
long-threatened conflagration.
While the troops on each side are
carrying on movements that look to
protection, the diplomatic branch of the
administration will be carrying on negotiations
with Carranza's diplomats
in the hope that an agreement may be
made tha^ will be satisfactory, and it is
in these negotiations that officials today
looked for the hope pt averting a
bloody struggle. President Wilson will
continue to be courteous toward the

1 be made.
War Department Without
Evidence That Villa Bands
Are Effectively Dispersed
Secretary Baker of the War Department
said he was unable to comment
upon Gen. Carranza's note, because it
raised questions of administration
1 policy entirely within the jurisdiction
of the President and the State Department.
Although Gen. Carranza raised side
issues, administration officials, at their
first view of the communication, regarded
the principal contentions as
being that the object of the punitive
expedition has been accomplished so
far as it can he. and that the Villa
I bands have been dispersed.
War Department officials take the
view that they have no evidence that
the Villa bands have been dispersed,
because they never have had definite
information of their number and that
the very nature of the situation gives
no evidence that the raiders have been
exterminated.
Some State Department officials confessed
that Gen. Carranza's note was
not a surprise.
Counselor Polk confirmed the statement
in the note that when he asked
for use of the Mexican railways the
reply was "satisfactory," but was coupled
with an expression of surprise
that the United States had not awaited
final approval of the pending protocol
before sending troops across the border.
It was declared officially, however,
that no formal protest against the entry
of Gen. Pershing's columns had!
been previously made by Gen. Carranza.
When the advance troops |
crossed at Columbus, It was officially |
stated, a Carranza general met them
at the border and made no protest
either personally or on behalf of his
government.
State Department officials took the
view that Gen. Carranza's note was
not a demand for immediate withdrawal
of the forces, but an invitation to
i begin negotiations to limit their stay.
Counselor Polk conferred with Maj.
I Gen. Scott, chief of staff, and anI
nounced that the negotiations would
be handled exclusively by Secretary
Lansing.
Bandit Baid Near Guaymas.
Dispatches received early today at
the Navy Department from Admiral
Winslow, commanding the Pacific fleet,
made no mention of a reported bandit
raid upon Americans near Guaymas.
Admiral Winslow reported arrival of
the cruiser Denver at La Paz, Mexico,
en route to San Diego. He did not
mention ordering the Denver to Guaymas
to investigate the alleged attack
upon the Americans and no orders have
been sent from the Navy Department
to that effect.
Admiral Winslow stated that the
supply ship Glacier was bringing a
number of Americans from Mazatlan.
The last report from Admiral Winslow
was dated yesterday at 10 a.m. and
reported Guaymas and vicinity quiet.
The cruiser Chattanooga there, navy
officials believe, is able to cope with
any anti-American incident without assistance
from the Denver. A considerable
Carranza garrison is also understood
to be at Guaymas.
Navy dispatches reported quiet at
Vera Cruz, Tampico and Progreso.
It was evident today that the War
Department, without reference to diplomatic
considerations, has endeavored
to provide against every possibility in
details of the pursuit of Villa's bands.
Strictest secrecy has been observed in
that regard, but It is well understood
that In every movement of troops beyond
the border and along the international
line the possibility of an attempt
to cut off the expedition has
been considered.
It is unquestionaUe that the War Department
is prepared to take immediate
steps to back up trie border forces with
National Guard organizations should need
arise. I
The diplomatic situation was not nearly
so clear as the military. Home officials i
privately expressed the view that Gen. |
Carranza might have felt compelled to |
seek the withdrawal of American troops |
in deference to public sentiment in j
Mexico. j
Jt was pointed out that the unofficial j
text of his note sought only the open- j
ing of negotiations to that end. and that
it contained not even a request for the
withdrawal. Even that suggestion was
: founded on statements of fact which
: would be themselves debatable, one of
1 these being that the expedition had
already accomplished its purpose.
In any event, it. seemed likely that a
[ more or less prolonged diplomatic dis1
cussion was foreshadowed rather than
any military change. _ ?

Carranza Note Says U. S. Has

First Chief Declares Protocol Was to

Columbus Incident.
MEXICO CITY, April 13.?The
Mexican government has sent tc
its ambassador in Washington a
note to be delivered at 10 a.m.
to Secretary Lansing, asking that
the American troops be withdrawn
from Mexican territory
and that the pursuit of Villa be
left to the Mexican constitutionalist
army.
The Mexican note contains about 5,000
words. In it the de facto government
of Mexico contends that, as the American
troops crossed into Mexico without
permission, they should be withdrawn
until a proper formal compact can be
entered into between the two governments.
It is insistently affirmed that
the previous notes of the Mexican government
especially emphasized the fact
that permission for reciprocal crossing
of the frontier would be granted only
in the event of the repetition of a raid
similar to that made by Villa at Columbus,
X. M.
Sent to Ambassador Arredondo.
The note was sent to Eliseo Arredondo,
the Carranza representative in
Washington, with instructions for its
delivery to Secretary JLansing, "so ending
negotiations for a reciprocal passing
of troops and asking for disoccupation
of the territory occupied by American
troops in view of Villa's party
having been destroyed."
Throughout the note emphasis is laid
on the fact that the American expedition
was undertaken under a misunderstanding.
Although acting in good faith
the declaration is made that the United
States had interpreted the first note
of the de facto government as effecting
a definite agreement between the
two nations. But the intention of the
de facto government was that no expedition
should be sent into Mexico until
terms and conditions relative to an
agreement were defined.
The note declares, therefore, that in
consequence of no final agreement having
beeen reached as to the terms of
the treaty to regulate the reciprocal
passage of troops over the dividing
line, "the Mexican government judges
it convenient to suspend for the present
all discussion or? negotiations in
this particular or founded on the circumstances
that thfe expedition sent
by the United States government to
pursue vuia is- without foundation in
virtue of the non-existence of a previous
agreement, formal and definite."
Applied to Future Incidents.
What was intended by the note of
March 10, it Is pointed out, was to submit
a proposal "by means of which the
forces of one and the other country
could reciprocally cross the dividing
line in pursuit of bandits, if unfortunately
there should be repeated along
the border acts like those committed
in Columbus.''
The note adds, however:
"From the beginning the Mexican
government judged tltat by reason ot
the time which had transpired and for
the purpose of treating a case already
passed the said incident could not continue
as a proposal for the reciprocal
I passing of troops."
| The fact that the United States had
incorrectly interpreted the note oi
March 10, was called to the attention
of the Washington government, the
statement points out, in a note dated
[March 17. This note likewise empha!
sized that the passage of troops would
be permitted "only if unfortunately,
from this time forward, there should
be repeated irruptions like the one registered
at Columbus or of any other
kind whatever at any point of th
frontier line."
Deplored by Mr. Polk.
On March 18, the statement continues,
Frank Polk, acting Secretary of State,
in an interview with the Carranza
confidential agent deplored not having
received the observations of the Mexican
government before American
troops crossed the border, declaring
that the passage of troops took place
in the best of faith and in the belief
that it would not be necessary to enter
into more details of an agreement,
which was considered definite and ended.
/
These declarations made by Mr. Polk
were later confirmed on March 23 tc
the Mexican representative by Secretary
Lansing, "who stated also that he
was sorry at having interpreted wrongly
the contents of the said note in respect
to the passage of troops, and
that, they would not advance more tc
the south of the place where they then
were."
Reference is also made in the not*
to the declaration made by Presideni
Wilson on March 26, saying the "ex
pedition was ordered under an agree
ment with the de facto government 01
Mexico for the purpose only of capturing
the bandit Villa, whose forces have
invaded territory of the United State!
and on no pretext whatever would wi
order an invastion of that republic 01
a violation of its sovereignty."
Corrected President Wilson's Idea.
"That idea," continues the note, "pub
lished by his excellency. President Wil
son, was rectified on March 31. by i

Impression Prevails T\

The gravity of the Mexican
Carranza's note that the America
ico was reflected in the discuss;
both sides of the chamber today
speak for quotation until they ha
had heard from the White House.
The impression prevailed amc
ators alike that either the admin
the American troops or it would
border and into Mexico.
Chairman Stone Silent.
Senator Stone of Missouri, chairman of
the foreign relations committee, declined
to comment upon the Mexican note, but
said he intended to call upon Secretary
Lansing during the day to discuss the
matter with him and to get further information.
"The situation looks very bad to me,"
said Senator Gallinger, the republican
leader. "If the Carranza note is to be
taken as a demand upon the United
States to withdraw the expedition against
Villa, then in my opinion either those
troops will have to be withdrawn, with
the consequent humiliation to the whole
. country, or we will have to send more
' troops down there.
, "I have never had any confidence In
i Carranza and I am inclined to believe
that this demand upon the United
I States to withdraw American troops
is a play to gain political support for
, himself among the Mexicans. He may
feel that his power is tottering."
Considers Situation Serious.
Senator Simmons, one of the democratic
leaders, said that he considered
the Mexican situation very serious.
- "I do not care to say what I think
should be done at this juncture, but
am waiting to hear what the President
: has to say," he commented. "But If
' Carranza means In his note that unless
1 American troops are to be withdrawn
v.o win attack them, then we must
! either withdraw the troops or send
more down there."
Senator Kern, the chairman of the
democratic caucus of the Senate, expressed
his concern at the situation.
Fear was expressed by some of the
senators lest there should be a inas
sacre of detached groups of American
troops now operating in Mexico against
> Villa if Carranza determines to force
the issue. They said that the adminis-?
tration should have acted weeks ago
I and should have sent many more troops
to the border.
News Is Keenly Awaited.
L All of the senators were keenly
awaiting news from the White House
J and State Department. While some
expressed the opinion thaT the admin?
istration would not agree to the del
mand that the troops be ordered out of
I Mexico until Villa has been killed or
captured, others made the prediction
that the troops would be recalled.
"They would never have been sent
into Mexico if the adniinistratioh had
. not believed that it had the consent of
the Carranza government," said one
senator who frequently has denounced
? the policy of the administration toward
Mexico as weak-kneed. "And I

The charge in the Carranza note that
there had been some crooked dealing
in the matter of sending troops into
Mexico at all created much surprise and
indignation.

Cancels New York Trip Because of
Pressing Nature of Foreign
Situations.
NEW TOP.K. April 13.?Officers of
the New York YounR Democratic Club
were disappointed today to learn that
important business at Washington had
caused President Wilson to cancel his
engagement to speak at their dinner
here Saturday night. Notwithstanding
the inability of the President to attend,
they said, arrangements for the
dinner would be continued.
In selecting those who were to appear
with President Wilson at the dinner
officers of the club endeavored to
give representation to various shades
of sentiment in the democratic party.
The speakers will be former Gov.
Martin H. Glynn, who will represent
the up-state democrats; George McAneny,
for independent democrats;
Clarence J. Shearn. for the Independent
League, and Sheriff Alfred E. Smith,
for the local democratic organization.
Local leaders expected the President
to deliver an address which would be a
keynote to the approaching presidential
campaign. More than 3,000 applications
for seats at the dinner have been received.
There will be accommodations
for only 500.
Detained by Foreign Situations.
In view of the pressing nature of the
situations with Germany and Mexico,
President wnson ioaay aDanaoned his

U. S. FORCES CLASH
WITH CARRANZISTAS '
IN CITY OF PARRAL
SAN ANTONIO, April 13 ?
Advices received at department
headquarters, Fort Sam
Houston, today state that
American forces have had an
encounter with either Mexican
military forces or the civilian
population of Parral. No details
are available. I
The report came to Gen. Funston
from American Consul
Letcher. It stated that Maj.
Gutierrez, commander at rarral,
said there was . a clash
which he termed unimportant
between American forces and
the troops of the garrison or i
residents of Parral. The Americans
entered the town with the
intention of marching through
en route southward. An exchange
of shots followed.
The inference is that the (
Americans continued to march
through the town. They probably
were the troops of Maj.
Tompkins.
(iutierrez minimized the affair,
saying the Americans appeared
suddenly, unheralded, ]
and the Mexicans were alarmed.War
Department officials, to ,
whom Consul Letcher has been
sending dispatches direct, declined
to discuss the report of
firing on American troops in
Parral. but indicated that such
a report had been received.

tion to Advance Hearing of

Justice Siddons of the District Supreme
Court today denied the motions
of Charles C. Glover. William J.
Flather and Henry H. Flather. respectively,
president, vice president and
former cashier of the Riggs National
Bank, to advance for trial and to require
a more specific bill of particulars
in the perjury charge against the bank
officials. The court holds that the bill
of particulars submitted by United
States Attorney Laskey, and comprising
932 items, "reasonably complies
with the requirements of the motions."
The court also considers the da-e?May
8?as designated by the government to
be an "early date," as requested by the
defendants.*
Time for Preparation Needed.
At the argument of the motions last
Saturday cot&sel for the bank officials
asked that the trial be advanced so as
to begin April 17, but United States
Attorney Laskey urged that the interval
before that date would not be
sufficient for the proper preparation of
the government's case. He urged that
May 8 would not be unreasonable, as,
according to the view of the counsel
for the defense, the trial would be
protracted beyond June 30?the date ;
of the expiration of the bank's charter?if
commenced at the time eug- ]
gested by the defense.
The counsel for the defendants had j
calculated that if the government offered
its 932 items of the bill of particulars,
and if fifteen minutes only
was consumed on each item, the case 1
could not be terminated within three .
months.

PARIS, April 13, 4:55 p.m.
? Semi - official announcement
was made here today
that the French government
has documentary evidence
that the Sussex.was attacked
by a submarine. The statement,
which was given out
after the receipt here of the
German note to the United
States, is as follows:
"It suffices in order to answer
the German note to recall
that fragments of a torpedo
have been discovered
in the hull of the Sussex,

The German note on the Sussex
and other submarine cases
has been received at the State Department
and was being "decoded
today. It probably will be laid
before President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing before night.
The affidavits from Paris and
London expected today on the

in connection with the German
note and the "information" regarding
attacks on merchant
vessels since the Lusitania is expected
to be completed in time

are not being: disclosed, it is

positive evidence of Germany's good
Faith to fulfill the assurances she has
fiven the United States, such as posjibly
substantial punishment of the
submarine commander who sunk the
Sussex, can prevent the situation beween
the two countries from cominjr
o the pass which diplomats have
itruggled for the last year to avoid.
The use of the word ultimatum In conlection
with the document to be forvarded
to Berlin is discouraged by offl:lals,
still it was said the effect of the
ommumcation would be to call for
rrompt action. In view of the conclusive
lature of the information on the Sussex
ilready before the State Department, offl:ial8
cannot see how Germany can coninue
to deny responsibility for the de?
traction of the ship.
No Chance of Arbitration.
The suggestion of arbitration in the
Jerman note was met with the statement
hat the American government would not
rbitrate a question involving American
ives. The same statement was made durng
the Lusitania negotiations.
Careful examination of the German
ote led officials to conclude that the
ase of the United States had been maerially
strengthened. The similarity
etween the circumstances surroundig
the attack on a steamer in the
English channel, admitted in the German
note, and those surrounding the
ussex case caused officials to feel
here no longer is any doubt that the
easel was the Sussex.
Senators and representatives who
ailed at the White House went away
rith the impression that action was
nminent, but that another communiation
would be sent to Berlin before
lore drastic steps were taken.
Lives Constantly in Danger.
Germany's admissions that her sub*
larines recently torpedoed three merhant
ships carrying Americans,* and
bat one of them attacked a vessel
ear the point where the Sussex met
isaster, simplifies somewhat the
rork of the State Department in prearing
for the next step of this coiin y
in the submarine controversy. Ofci&ls
make it plain that the step
ests on the accumulation of evidence
rat American lives are constantly in
anger in violation of their rights.
The United States will continue to
omplle evidence Indicating that German
eubmeraibles are operating In vioitlon
of the rules of International law.
