E.F. Gorman of Hart township
announces in this issue of the
Mirror as a candidate for the of

to the wishes of the Republican
voters at the primary election on
Aug. 1. He was born and raised
in Hart township, and is a young
man who has the respect and
confidence of tlie entire commu
nity in which he lives. He has
been a life long Republican, and
has never before asked tor a
public office. He is married and
has a family. He is certainly a
self-made man, his father having
died when he was 6 years of age.
His success in life and his square
dealings with all with whom he
has had business transactions
have made him many friends,
and his nomination will add great
streugth to the ticket.

Obituary
James Meek was born July 25,
1826, in Tennessee; died April 9,
J silo; agea o years, t nmntns, o
days. He came to Lawrence Co ,
Mo., 53 years ago, moving about
35 years ago to Mansfield, where
he resided until 7 years ago when
he moved to Mountain Grove,
where he resided at the time of
his death. He was the father of
5 sons and 3 daughters; i sons
and 2 daughters survive him; 3
sons nnrl a flMiifrhf irm-H u-irh I
him at the time of Ids death He
was converted in early life and
united with the Baptist church
over 50 yeirs ago, living a consci
entious Christian life, taking at
all times a very active interest in
all Christian work connected with
the church. He served with
much credit in the Unipn army
during the Civil War. He leaves
a wife and 6 children, with a host
of friends, to mourn his depart
ure. The body was shipped to
Seymour Monday morning and
ennveyed to the tlaptist church
where, at 2 p. in., the writer
preached the funeral sermon, us
ing as a text Rev. 14:13, after
which the Masonic lodge of Se.y
mour conveyed the remains to
the Masonic cemetery where the
Masonic ceremony was in charge
of Dr. Trimble, W. M. Thus an
old citizen, a man ripe in years
and experience, has passed away
JOSEPH DAVIS
Kay Floyd Dennis, son of Eoy
Dennis and wife, depaited this
life from their home near Mans
field March 30, 1916, at l.-l'O p. m
His age was 3 yeais S months, 7
days. His short stay here was
very pleasant and made the homo
glad. His ways were very at
tractive and made all who knew
him like him and give him special
attention. During his sickness
he was very patient. On the day
of his departure he called for his
play toys and looked at t hem, as
if to give them a farewell look: he
wanted to hug his papa's neck,
and had a smile on his face; in
fact, his actions showed just like
he was telling all guoi bye. 1
have often thought that when
children are special favorites, at
tract attention more than is com
mon, ann are good ami obedient
in the home, it is a sign they are
too good to stay here, and will
not live long. With all the good
care and training that his par
ents gave and t he good home they
had for him, he is now much bet
ter off, for while the body was
laid to rest in the Turner ceme
tery, Kay is not there; he has
gone to his home in Heaven,
where he is under the parental
care of our Heavenly Father, as
sociated with his loved ones who
have gone on before. The funeral
service was conducted by the
waiter at the Dennis church in
the presence of a number of rel
atives and loving, affectionate
friends. The parents have my
special prayers

THEY VISIT SCHOOL
; Many Patrons View the Ex-
cellent Work That it
Being Done
A "great many of the citiaens
of Mansfield took the opportu
nity offered Sunday afternoon to
inspect the school building and
see the display of sewing and
other work that the pupils have
this year. Every room was in
teresting and the display in each
was a compliment to the teacher
in charge of it. To some people
theagriculture experiments were
most interesting; others enjoyed
most the drawing and hand work
ot the grades; others still were
pleased with the sewing display.
Every patron should see that the
standard of the school for next
year is kept up or raised net
lowered.
The girls in the sewing class
have each done eleven pieces of
work this year besides learning
the stitches, different kinds of
patching, sewing on buttons,
making button holes and putting
on honks and eyes and other fas
teners. They have learned to
use two styles of sewing mach
ine and given some time to the
study of fabrics.
The seed corn testing experi
ments have worked out just as
nicely ys we could wish, showing
clearly that an ear of corn may
look good and yet be of very low
vitality. The most surprising
thing of all is how few 'farmers1
i-ver test their seed corn at all.
Each room will furnish one or
more songs at the assembly per
iod Monday morning and each
high school class will have charge,
of the three remaning assembly
periods.
The graduating exercises will
be held Friday, May 12. The
seniors are preparing an excel
lent program and should have
every patron in town present to
hear it.
The pupils who finish the book
keeping and sewing courses in
addition to the regular work will
receive extra c edit for it.
