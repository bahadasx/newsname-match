JAMES E. BEAVIS HONORED
When it became known last week
that James Beavis was to take his de
parture on Friday our citizens decided
that it was an auspicious time to give
him an expression of good will, so the
word was passed quickly round and a
meeting was held at the store or I. :.
Cochrane, where committees were ap
pointed aud all plans made for a ban
quet and smoker to be held in Masonic
hall ou Thursday evening.
The menu for the feast was put into
the hands of the 1'reBbyterian ladies,
and then some tall hustling was done
by both men and women in the two
days allowed for preparation.
At seven o'clock ou Thursday eve
ning as the guests entered the hall, ;l
eyes were greeted with a sight which
snowed at once that evervthing was
complete. Kong tables stretched the
length of the room, connecting at the
farther end. Candles adorned them
with pink shades, and the electric
chandeliers were shaded in pink.
Eighty-two men sat down to the
banquet wifh Mayor Mclntyre, W. A.
Cavanagh, J. K. Beavis, Toastraaster
N.J. Drouyor, Rev. Waldren Geach,
N . B. Herbert and entertainer Mart
Ryan at the head of the table.
l'lenty of time was devoted to the
satisfying of the inner man with the
many and delicious viands served in
good order by the ladies, while Button's
orchestra dispensed sweet music, and
when all were in that comfortable
frame of mind derived from a good
dinner, cigars and speakers were intro
duced. Toastmaster Drouyor made things
lively by jokes and jolly speeches.
Rev. Geach, Mayor Mclntyre, W. A.
Cavanagh, N. B. Herbert, F. O. Putney,
John Sheehy, F. T. Falmer, Dr. J. B
Stevens, Dr. V. A. Lacy, A. W. Kelly,
Postmaster Farley, on being called
upon, each expressed his regret at los
ing so valuable a man from Yale, wish
ing Mr. Beavis every prosperity, the
best of health, peace and happiness
wherever he might cast his lot in the
future. Mr. Beavis was then presented
with a set of gold cuff links, and in a
neat little speech thanked the kind
people of Yale for the courtesies, sym
pathy and honors shown him during
his fourteen years residence here, not
overlooking the elaborate spread and
kind expressions of good will towards
him that evening.
Mart Ryan, of Detroit, kept the com-
Eany in laughter and a pleasing mood
y his witty stories and comical say
lugs.
About eleven o'clock all departed for
their homes, feeling that 'twas well
for brethren to dwell together in unity.
NOTE
Why not have a get to-gether banquet
often? Just a plain, informal garner
ing of the citizens of our town?
Wouldn't it make for better feeling,
and result in the better interests of
our city ?
The ladies of the Presbyterian church
are to be complimented oh the excel
lent manner with which they arranged
the men's banquet last week on BUch
short notice.
WORTHY OF NOMINATION

pleasure, in the past twenty five years
of endorsing many candidates for the

townships surrounding, were nominat
ed and elected, and furthermore the
ones elected have always made good
in the onices to which the people elect
ed them.
