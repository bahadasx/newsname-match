El Paso, April 12.—A band of Villis
tas numbering several hundred and
possibly a thousand may have sack­
ed Sierra Mojada, five miles across
the Coahuila line, and 80 miles east
of Guiminez, destroying many thous­
ands of dollars worth of American
property and looting the town of
everything of value.
This news, which may prove to ^e
of the highest information, as it is
believed possibly Villa himself was
among the raiders, was received here
today by the representative of one of
the largest American mining con­
cerns in Mexico and is accepted by
him as absolutely authentic. The
bandits made their attack on the
tov/n on April 5.
Villa May Be There.
Numerous reports agree that Villa
is convinced the soldiers of the Unit­
ed States will soon be recalled and
that then he will be able to rally
all the anti-Carranzistas factions in
Northern Mexico to his standard.
Americans Killed.
Several Americans have been killed
or wounded in bandit raids in the vi­
cinity of Guaymas, Sonora, according
to a naval radio message received
here today. The message was for­
warded to the navy department at
Washington, and resulted in an order
to the cruiser Denver, now at San
Bias, State of iepic, to steam for the
Sonora port and investigate.
General Ynez Salazar, who disap­
peared from El r*aso several days ago,
was positively identified today at
Morris (T. O.) ranch in Mexico, 90
miles south of here and 40 miles
south of the border.
He had with him four companions
and is said to have threatened to kill
one of the American ranch hands who
knew him personally. The party left
doing no damage but took rifles and
ammunition owned by ranch hands.
Delay Hampers Pershing.
Further delay in providing Gen.
Pershing with more men for his oper­
ations against Vil.a, believed now to
have effected a juncture with his
forces from Durango, appeaared cer­
tain tonight in view of the dvaance
ment today of tentative arrangements
for the shipments of supplies over the
Mexican Central raailroad.
Wether the somewhat vague under­
standing entered into between Ameri­
can officers and Carranza authorities
for the ipovement of supplies, con­
signed aS ordinary freight, is a suc­
cess was considered in some quarters,
but by headquarters officials it was
deemed worthy of trial.
Reports reached Gen. Funston from
El Paso late today that a train of sup­
plies left Juarez for Chihuahua this
afternoon under the new arrange­
ment.
Without Information.,
Gen. Funston continued without in­
formation today as to the location of
the advance cavalry detachment and
no reports supplied additional infor­
mation concerning the whereabouts
of Villa or the state of his health. In
the absence of definite information,
Gen. Funston was not inclined to be­
lieve the report that he was dead,
but neither did he give credence to it.
The report reached here while he
and his officers at El Paso were in
the midst of negotiations to inaugur­
ate the shipping of supplies over the
Mexican Central, and its receipt did
not alter those negotiations nor any
of the work connected with the rout­
ine of the campaign.

The belief that Villa himself
•be directing the operations of
bandits is supported by a report re­
ceived today from Ojanaga, stating
lliat Col. Rojas, the commander
there, had information that Villa had
doubled in his tracks and was 200
miles southwest of that town.
Another circumstance that gives
color to this locating of the bandit
chief is the fact that Canuto Reye^
at the head of a large number of ment
was reported from Torreon a week
ago, to be travelling north in the di
rcction of Sierra Mojada. It it proves

School Bond Issue
Is Snowed Under by
Taxpayers of Bismarck
Taxpayers and voters turned out,
many of them women, yesterday af­
ternoon and snowed under the propo­
sition of the school board to issue
$50,000 bonds for the erection of a
new school house.
Out of a total vole of 35,3, there
were 293 votes against the proposi­
tion and 60 votes for it. Two spoiled
their ballots, one forgetting to mark
the slip and another voting both for
and against it.
This does not mean that Bismarck
is opposed to additional school facili­
ties, but that the taxpayers refused
the bond issue in the absence of some

CONCERNED OVER
CARRANZA'S ATTITUDE
Permission to Use Mexican Rail'

Granted.
_— I
Washington, April 12.—Furlheiln
crease of the United States forces1 in
Mexico is again prominent in official
consideration. It was learned tonight
that upon the return here tomorrow
of Secretary Baker from Clevelaifl'
there might be important dev|||p
mcnis.
Gen. l'tfi
movements in the hunt for Villa
would include adequate preparation
for any eventuality. Strengthening of
the lines ol' communication for which
troops are needed, principally lias
proceeded with that view in end. Late
today confidential advices were re­
ceived from Gen. Funston, and it is
understood they refer to the question
of the line of communication.
Army Officials 'Nervous.
Concern of army officials on Iho
border regarding movements of Car­
ranza troops toward Casas Grandes
was reflected to some extent in offi­
cial quarters here tonight. It was
officially stated that Gen. Funston
had complete authority for any move­
ment of troops on the border to safe­
guard the United States advance col­
umns and their lines.
Won't Call Guard Yet.
•Persistent reports that the use of
the National Guard was contemplated
drew a- statement on high authority
that there was no consideration of
such a step, and u.at only in the
fevent of more widespread military
operations than the mere chase of
Villa and his outlaws, would the reg­
ulars need support. Neither the state
nor war departments had any further
information regarding Villa's death.
The report was doubted in all official
quarters as a futile hoax to gain time
for Villa.
Use Railroads.
It was stated that the use of Mexi­
can Central or National railway from
Juarez, as well as the Mexican North
western lines, might largely solve the
transportation problem. The first use
of the Mexican Central was made yes­
terday.
Officials asserted that use of the
Mexican Central railroad was not for­
mally requested by this government
from the de facto government. It
was explained, however, that objec­
tion by Carranza to this "commer­
cial" use of the Mexican Central was
not anticipated or even indicated in
the negotiations.
BUYS ART GOODS.
Tuesday a deal was consummated
whereby George LaLone took over
the entire stock of moldings, pictures
and other art material of A. L. Truax.
MILLION DOLLAR
DEAL IN BISMARCK
The Caruguss Manufacturing Co., of Bismarck, closed a
deal with a large eastern concern, disposing of their entire
output of Sanitary Dispensing Cases. The deal involves over
a million dollars.
This concern has been in business less than one year. It
was organized ,and has been conducted exclusively by Bis­
marck men. They also manufacture the Caruguss Seed
Tester, which is used in all parts of the United States and
foreign countries. The name, "Bismarck," appears on all
their dispensing cases and seed testers. The advertisement
the Capital City is getting is of real value.
The board will meet tonight in Mr.
Wachter's office to canvass the vote.
Never before have the women
turned out in such numbers, although
there were more votes cast by men
than by women. Many women ac­
companied their husbands and helped
to beat the proposition.
Interest in the election was in­
tense and the vote apparently indi­
cates that the people of Bismarck
want a definite announcement of a
building policy before voting for any
more school bonds.

the Commander's Report Is
Not Given.
Washington, April 12.—Admission
by iGermany that her submarines re­
cently attacked three merchant ships
carrying American citizens and that
one of them torpedoed a vessel in the
vicinity of the point wiiere the Chan­
nel steamer, Suesjex, was damaged by
an explosion has simplified the task
of the state department for prepar­
ing for the next step of the United
States over the issue of submarine
warfare, following the receipt of
press dispatches of the latest German
note, it was stated the United States
would continue to compile informa­
tion indicating that German subma­
rines are operating in violation of
the rules of international law ana
that very soon a communication de­
signed to be the linal word of the
American government on the subject
would go forward to -Merlin. The
state department virtually has com­
pleted the collection of tacts relating
to all attacks on merchant ships
since the Lusitania.
Text of Note.
The following is the text of the
German note on the Sussex, dated
April 10:
"The undersigned has the honor to
inform Your Excellency, Ambassador
Gerard, in response to communica­
tions of the 29t.li and 30th ultimo, and
the 3rd inst., regarding the steamers,
Sussex, Manchester, Engineer, Eng­
lishman, tE-er wind vale, and Eagle
'Point, that the mentioned cases, in
accordance with /hi* of the
SOtli and I!rsi/iu'iflJoTaiid'lue 4tli~ani(
5th instant, has been subjected to
careful investigation by the admiral's
staff of the navy, which has led to
the following results:
Tried to Run Away.
"First—The English steamer, Ber­
windvale, a steamer which was possi­
bly the Berwindvale was encountered
on the evening of March 1ti, on the
Irish coast by a 'German submarine.
The steamer, as soon as she noted
the submarine, which was running
unsubmerged, turned and steamed
away. She was ordered to halt by a
warning shot. She paid
110
atten­
tion, but extinguished all lights and
attempted to escape.
"Second—The British steamer, Eng­
lishman. This steamer was called
upon to halt, by a German submarine
through two warning shots, about 20
sea miles west of fslay (Hebrides).
"After the German commander had
convinced himself that the crew had
taken to the boats, and rowed from
the ship, he sank the steamer.
In iDoubt About This One.
"Third—The British steamer, (Man­
chester Engineer. It is impossible to
establish through the investigation
up to the present, whether the at­
tacks on this steamer, which, accord­
ing to the given description, occurred
on March 24, in the latitude of Wa
terford, is attributable to a German
submarine.
Torpedoed Eagle Point.
"Fourth—'The British steamer, Ea­
gle Point. This steamer, irt the fore­
noon of March 28, was called upon
to halt by a German submarine
through signal and shots, about 100
—not 130—sea miles from the south­
west coast of Ireland, but proceeded.
After the commandant convinced him­
self that the boats, which had hoist­
ed sails, had gotten clear of the
steamer, he sank the steamer.
Possibly Sussex.
"Fifth—The French steamer,
sex. Ascertainment of the
whether the Channel Steamer, Sus­
sex, was damaged by a German sub­
marine was rendered extremely diffi­
cult because no definite details of
time, ,place and attendant circum­
stances of the sinking were known.
Sus
fact
Believed It 'Mine Layer.
"In the general region between
Folkestone and Dieppe, on March 24,
a long black craft, without a flag, hav­
ing a gray funnel, small gray fore
works, and two high masts, was en­
countered about, the middle of the
English Channel by a German subma­
rine. The commander reached the
conclusion that it was a war vessel,
and, indeed, a mine layer of the re­
cent Arabic class.
"Consequently, he attacked the ves­
sel at 3:65 in the afternoon, Middle
Eurpean time. The torpedo struck,
and caused such a violent explosion
in the forward part of the ship that
the entire forward part was torn
away to the bridge.

CAN USE CONVICT
LABOR ON BUILDING
Just a Pew More Reasons Why
New Rockforjl.'s Bubble Should
Be Punctured.
If New iRockford succeeds in cap­
turing the state capital, property now
owned by the state and valued at
$1,000,000, would revert back to the
Northern Pacific. Parties interested
looked up the original deed of the
capitol grounds, which runs from the
Northern Pacific to the state. It is
specifically provided that this proper­
ty is to be used only as a permanent
site for the state capital.
Do the voters of this state want to
return $1,000,000 worth of property
back to the iNorthern Pacific? If
they do they should sign the New
Rockford petitions. On the other
hand, if they desire title to remain
in the state, they should promptly
refuse to aid the proposition landing
on the ballot.
In time this state will need a new
building. The law provides that con­
vict labor can be used in the con­
struction of a capitol building. Con­
tractors estimate that labor and ma­
terial in a building amount to about
the same figure.
The penitentiary is located at Bis­
marck, which makes available con­
vict labor both for the erection and
care of state buildings at 'Biqmarck.
If the capital were located at New
Rockford, this labor would not be
available and the state would have to
impose more taxes both for the erec­
tion and 'maintenance of the new
buildings.
Just think, this over before signing

Sccore Hay Army Bill as a Men­
ace Penalty Be on Heads
of Supporters.
Washington, April 12.—Sessions of
the annual convention of the Navy
League of the United States was feat­
ured today by attacks on Secretary
Daniels for his refusal to permit Rear
Admiral Bradley Kislce to read a pa­
per at the convention and a denuncia­
tion of the Hay army bill by Stan
wood Menken, president of the Na­
tional Security league.
Must Have Its Dreyfus.
Robert M. Thompson, president of
the Navy league, called the navy de­
partment's policy narrow and assail­
ed the secretary for what he termed
a suppression of free speech. Henry
Reuterdahl declared the department's
attitude was but a reflection of the at­
titude of the White House and said
"every administration must have its
Dreyfus."
Hay Bill a Menace.
Mr. Menken characterize^ the Hay
bill as a menace to the country and
as a violation of every recommenda­
tion of experts. He charged that con­
gress was ignoring a demand for de­
fense on lines laid down by men who
knew. He said the American people
had shown themselves for prepared­
ness and that congress should know
that "their uelays are intolerable and
that if we are attacked theirs will be
the penalty for the wreck of the na­
tion." The Navy league received a
telegram today from a Chicago news­
paper offering to donate to the league
money it had received from an anti
preparedness pian inserted by Mr.
Ford.

Janesxille, Wis., April 12.—William
Brooks, aged 13 years, averted what
might have been a bad railroad acci­
dent when he discovered today a
broken rail two feet in length, over
which the C. & W. sends its fast­
est trains north and south. The brok­
en rail was discovered by Brooks in
the southern part of the city a few
minutes oeforc a passenger train
from Chicago, leaving there at 4
o'clock was due to arrive. The south­
bound train would have passed over
the same track some thirty minutes
later. Brooks telephoned the passen­

The amendment introduced by Sen­
ator Smith of South Carolina was un­
der discussion all day. It provides
for a plant with an ultimate cost of
$15,000,000, the surplus nitric acid
over what may be needed for powder
to go into fertilizer to be sold di­
rectly to the farmers by the secretary
of agriculture.
Senator Hardwick declared the
plan socialistic and repugnant to the
spirit of democracy. Senator Suther­
land questioned the constitutionality
of the fertilizer proposal, although he
said there could be no question as
to the government to manufacture
chemicals for its own military needs.
Senator .Hardwick's motion was de­
feated by the votes of 38 democrats
and nine republicans, among the lat­
ter being Senators Clapp, Grortna, Mc

FEEBLE ADMINISTRATION.
It is a pedagogic hint to be good and not cze.the feeble
Health administration of the University of North Dakota.
who were working for the interests of Bismarck at the last session
of the legislature know how the university officials, during the clos
ing sessions, attempted to deprive Bismarck of its bacteriological
station, although one is located here by statute.
DR. SMYTH ON JOB.
When the bill wjis drawn. Dr. 8inyth tliscos«red ,thafrino-ap-1
pri|priation had betnr provided for the-capital city. The bill tnwffjjy
mentioned the Grand Forks laboratory and the sub-laboratory At
Minot. Bismarck -was to be punished because this city and the
'Slope legislators led the agitation, for the board of regents plan
and made possible the future elimination of duplication and waste
in the administration of our educational and health affairs.
Although Dr. Bristol consents to receiving $450 yearly from
Bismarck to
not sufficient legislation to protect our milk supply. Portions of
his letter
be quoted later.
The Tribune is publishing at the bead of this article a portion
of the money the tax payers dig up each biennial period to get
adequate sanitary inspection. There is every reason to believe that
the money spent under the direction of the Agricultural college is
well expended, because Prof. Ladil has a national reputation as a
food chemist and as a sanitary expert.
TOO MANY COOKS.
Why the Health administration in North Dakota is assigned
to three bodies, none of which is forced to co-operate with the
other, no one knows.

•Washington, April 12.—Favorable
action by the senate on the proposal
to construct a huge hydro-electric-air
nitrogen plant for the manufacture of
war munitions in war time and fertil­
izer in times of peace was forecast
today, when a motion by Senator
Hardwick to strike out the fertilizer
feature of the pending amendment to
the army bill was defeated, 47 to 24.
-r*
in maintaining this station, he admits there
Here is the situation and It is one
the board cf resents should correct
at an early date and if necessary the
waste and inefficiency should be cor­
rected by special legislation.
North Dakota maintains a health
laboratory at Grand Forks and sub«
laboratories at Bismarck and Minot.
At Bismarck the salary of J. C. Wdns
low, local bacteriologist, is partially
paid by the city. In return he is sup­
posed to assist the health commis­
sioner in supervising the milk supply,
inspecting dairies and rendering
such other assistance as is necessary
to safeguard the health.
Doctors Must Dig Up.
Phys.cians send him in specimens
for analysis for wnich a fee is charg­
ed. Whether the laboratory was here
or not would make little difference 4o
the average physician as he must pay
for the service anyway. But as an
aid to the health officials on the slope,
the local laboratory under efficient
management can be of great assist*
ance.
These laboratories cost the state
practically $20,000 for a binennial
period exclusive of what the locali­
ties pay for special service.
Then we have a state health board
