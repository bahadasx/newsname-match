On The Advantages of Free Porte
Mr. P. C. Howe, Federal Commissioner of Immigra
tion, who Is one of the beat American authorities on
marine commerce, in discussing the relation of free ports
to the development of eea trade said In part:
"Ships will go hundreds of miles out of their way to
avoid ports surrounded by a tariff wall. The only way,
therefore, for a country with a tarifT to compete in the
shipping world with a free-trade country is to establish
free ports at strategical points along Its coast line. Ger
many haB done so, and in a comparatively short period
has built up a carrying trade which before the war was
,s .....seriously threatening England's supremacy. Hamburg,
... throe Herman free Dorts. now ranks as the seebnd greatest seaport
In the world, its total foreign commerce In 1913 being only $6,000,000 under
tha t of New York.
"The free port would offer great opportunity for flnancial opemiOTs now
made possible by the recent currency act. It would stimulate International
heniring , and would tend to shift the financial center of the world to this
country. And America, by the logic of events, has become thenA®
tor the trorld's financing, Just as London became that center several centuries
ago when it shifted from the cities of the Netherlands. But the financial
center will only move to this country when It becomes a clearing house of
coods as well as of money. For credit the world over is created by currently
created wealth In transit or change -x> that our financial expansion Is depend- -
ent upon the opening up of American ports to the clearance of the wealth of
the world. A port should not operate to yield a return on the investment, t
but to develop the prosperity af the country.' In recapitulating the advan
tages, Mr. Howe bring* out the importance of the free port in developing our
shipping and linking us with South America, Asia and Africa, md then con
eludes:
'The moat important gain is the direct gain to America
