The Devils Lake debating team,
'consisting of Herbert Ryan, Elizabeth
Dodge and Samson Sprung, won a un
animous decision in their debate with
Lakota on the evening of April 7. The
debate was held in the Lakota opera
house and was attended by a large
crowd of which Devils Lake contribut
ed a big delegation. Among the re
presentatives of Devils Lake were Mrs.
Sauvain, Principal Kittrell, Mr. Hov
de and a large members of students.
The team with the coach left in the
afteroon on train No. 10 while the
•others followed in the evening on No.
SO.
The Devils Lake team upheld the
negative of the question: "Resolved,
that immigration should be further
restricted by a literary test." Mr.
iRyui, who opened the debate for the
imgative, stated the points along
''which he and his colleagues proposed
to argue the question. His arguments
were that a literary test for immig
rants was a test of opportunity and
not a test of quality that such a
meusure would be an atempt to sec
ure by indirect means what ought to
and that, at the present rate of
growth of popular education in the
southern countries of Europe, such a
test would, within a few years, have
90 effect. Miss Dodge followed Mr.
IRyan with the arguments that th§ il
literate foreign assimilates with our
-people even more readily than the
literate that the percentage of illiter.
acy is the lowest in the states with
-the highest percentage of immigra
tion that the percentage of school at
tendance in our country is shown by
statistics to be higher among the chil
dren of foreign-born parents than
among the children of America par
entage which indicates that illiteracy
•is more self-propagating among the
native-born of American parentage
than among the native born of foreign
parentage. She produced a chart
which received considerbale comment
from many persons in tfhg audience,
and which showed certain facts that
the opposing side could not refute.
Mr. Sprung was the third speaker on
the negative. He opened his speech
with an appeal to the injustice of such
a test if enacted into law, and showed
how it would be a departure from our
historic principles. In the place of
such a test he proposed the substitu
tion of a biological, an economic and
a characteristic as the "American
test" for aliens.
The opposing speakers presented
their arguments in an effective way,
and brought on a spirited rebuttal in
which the Devils Lake speakers did
splendidly. The team on the affirma
tive side deservte much praise for the
work they did and for the excellent
fight which they put up. They need
feel no disgrace in defeat, and the
winning team can have only the high
est respect for their.efforts.
The visitors from Devils Lake are
also midful of the very kind hospita
lity and courtesy shown them by the
people of Lakota. The representa
tives of Devils Lake were most royally
entertained during their visit by the
members of the high school faculty,
the students and other citizens of La
kota.
Professor Taylor, head of the Eng
lish department of the state univer
sity, Superintendent Reineold of Lari
more and Superintendent Olson, Peter,
sburg acted as judges of the debate.
Devils Lake ought to be proud of
these young people who not only won
honors for themselves, but have
brought distinction to our schools and
city as well. And the interest which
so many of our citizens have shown
in the work of these people goes to
show that their efforts are appreciat
ed.Next year we may look for a still
more powerful debating team. We
can have a team that will make Devils
Lake a claimant to the first honors in
debate in the state.
We are pleased to announce that
Frank Honett, one of the prominent
farmers living near Webster, is get
ting along nicely since his sudden ill
ness last Thursday evening. At first
it was thought that Mr. Honett had
suffered a stroke of paralysis, but it
is believed now that it was a severe
attack of asthma. The many friends
of the Honett fmily will be pleased to
learn of his improvement.

G. A. R. AND W. R. C.
HERE MAY 24-25.
One of the important meetings in
this city this year will be the state
meeting of the G. A. R. and W. R. C.,
which will convene here May 24 and
25. Year by year the attendance at
these meeting are growing smaller, on
account of the old soldiers passing to
their reward, and this may possibly
be one of the last gatherings of the
kind held in the state. However, this
will be a gathering which will bring
many people to our city, and already
ample preparations are being made
for their entertainment.
STARTS HIS
Local Attorney, Who is Out for Con
gress, Gave Fine Talk.
Fredric T. Cuthbert, who is a
candidate for the Republican nomina
tion for congress from this district,
opened his campaign with a speech at
the local court house Monday evening.
Proceeding the meeting the local band
furnished several fine selections on
the street, and also at the hall. When
the time came for Mr. Cuthbert to
take the platform the court house was
crowded, and for nearly two hours he
held the closest attention of his audi
ence. He was introduced by Attorney
Rollo F. Hunt, who made a few well
directed remarks.
Mr. Cuthbert took up each plank in
the platform which he has adopted,
and upon which he will run, and in
a clear and concise manner told
his hearers just what they couold de
pend upon if he was sent to Congress.
His speech was one of sound logic
and his listeners pronounced it one of
the ablest talks what has been given
in our city for some time. Tuesday
Mr, Cuthbert left for Lakota, where
he was to deliver an address Tuesday
evening. .: v? ,'
CO-OPERATION
v.
The value of co-operation has long
been known. Aesop made it the sub
ject of one of his fables, which runs
as follows: "A father had a family of
sons who were perpetually quarreling
among themselves when he failed to
heal their disputes by his exhortations,
he determined to give them a practi
cal illustration of the evils of dis
union and for this purpose he one day
told them to bring him a bundle of
sticks. When they had done so, he
placed the bundle into the hands of
each in succession, and ordered them
to break It in pieces. They each trSrd
with all their strength, but were not
able to do it. He next untied the
bundle and took the sticks separately,
one by one and again put them into
their hands on which they broke them
easily. He then addressed them in
these words "My sons, if you are of
one mind, and unite to assist each
other you will be as this bundle of
sticks uninjured by all your enemies
but if you are divided among your
selves you will be broken as easily as
these sticks."
Cultivate Trees.
Where the rainfall is light grass
and weeds are the great enemy of
trees. The grass and weeds have their
roots nearer the surface than the
trees and so have the first chance at
the moisture when it rains. If there
is not enough for grass and trees, it
is the trees that have to suffer. Cul
tivate and keep the surface free from
grass and weeds to a distance a little
greater than the branches reach.
When this is done trees wi I usually
make a good growth in any part of
North Dakota.—W. C. P., North Da

A circular on Poultry Management
has just been issued by the North Da

YOUMANS SCORED BY JUDGE.
The $20C$0U daiilage suit which
Grant S. Youmans started against the
state banking board came to a sudden
termination at Minot last week, when
Judge Kneeshaw sustained the motion
of the defendants for a directed ver
dict. In addressing the jury Judge
Kneeshaw delivered a scathing ar
raignment of Youmans and his asso
ciates for the manner in which they
had conducted the ati'airs of tlie bank,
which was closed by order of the
state examiner .He charged the plain
tiff with fraud in securing mortgages
signed by "dummies" and then put
into the bank as part of the assets.
And thus the great case which some of
the anti-Hanna papers were making
such a fuss about has fallen flat. Now
we wonder if those papers will even
open their "pepper" about the results.

COSTS FORTY CENTS TO DE
LIVER A BUSHEL
OF WHEAT IN FR\
^£J.
Farm and Fireside tells Us that out
of the war has come inevitably a strik
ing change in the relation of American
business to ocean shipping. "Instead
of getting our wheat hauled across the
North Atlantic as ballast, it has re
cently been calculated that it costs
from 35 to 40 cents to deliver a bushel
of American wheat in France. The
Frenchman is paying the cost, and it
is so high that he is grumbling about
it, and has, like the Britisher, taken
steps for better and closer government
control of his ships."
Rumor has it that there will be at
least three candidates jn the field for
Superintendent of Schools for this
county. J. A. Haig, the present in
cumbent, has circulated his petition
and will ask for the nomination at
the primaries, and we have it on very
good authority that Thoralf Koppang,
a young man from the Edmore dis
trict, is also circulating a petition for
the nomination for this office and also
that the principal of the Churchs
erry schools will contend for the
place. This will make a three corner
ed ijerht, with one candidate from
each end of the county and one from
this city.
FOOT-AND-MOUTH OVER
LONG FIGHT AGAINST STOCK
PLAGUE ENDED BY REMOVAL
OF ALL FEDERAL QUARAN­
TINE RESTRICTIONS.
The long fight against the foot-and
mouth disease is over. The Secretary
of Agriculture has issued an order
which on March 31 removed all foot
and- mouth quarantines and restric
tions against the shipment and move
ment of live ^tock. The order signed
specifically removes the quarantine
from a small territory in Christian
County, 111., the last area which was
under suspicion. Along with the re
moval of this local quarantine, the var.
ious Federal orders restricting ship
ment of cattle are recinded, so that
dealers can now ship their cattle as
before the first quarantine was impos
ed.
Upon notification that the United
States is free from the disease, all for
eign governments which have placed
embargoes on American cattle are ex
pected to remove these embargoes, so
that cattle raisers will then be able to
resume shipments to these foreign
countries.
The magnitude of the work of erad
ication and control carried on by farm
ers, shippers, and the state and Fed
eral Government is shown by the fact
that before controlled the disease had
gained a temporary footing in 22
states and the district of Columbia.
The disease appeared and was con
trolled in 269 different counties.
The importance to the stock-raising
industry of eradicating foot and
mouth disease may be judged from the
results of this plague in Denmark,
where the disease appeared at about
the same time that it broke out in the
United States. The area of Denmark
is approximately equal to that of the
three New England States, Massa
chusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Is
land. It is, however, a great dairy
ing country, and it has been estimated
that the losses in milk in one year
caused by the foot and mouth disease
have amounted to approximately one
third of the total cost of eradicating
the pestilence in 22 States of this
country. The Danish authorities
wore
unable to carry out their former pol
icy of slaughter, and were compelled
to resort to such measures of control
as could be established by quarantine
and other restrictions.
As a result of better understanding
between the State and National Gov
ernments, representatives of the de
partment believe that many obstacles
which confronted the authorities in
the past outbreak would not be en
countered in dealing with any future
occurrence of the disease. The veter
inarians, however, will not nbate then
watchfulness for some time. Exam
ination of animals and animal pro
ducts offered for import will continue
to be unusually strict.
FIRST SECTION
nil! MANY
Up to the present time there- are
four candidates contending for the Re.
publican nomination for governor, or
at least four who claim the right to
ask for support of the Republican tick,
et. Col. J. H. Fraine, who is our
present Lieutenant governor. U. L.
Burdick, who was a candidate two
years ago, G. (Plaza) Smith, who was
ws a Non-Partisan candidte, until the
League disowned him, and Lynn Fra
zier, who is the Non-Partisan candid
ate, and who will file as a Republican.
In reality, there are only two Republi.
can candidates, Fraine and Burdick,
and it is rumored that an effort is be
ing made to have one of them retire
from the race, in order that the
strength of the Republicans of
state may b* Centered on

put a Republican, to piss under the

would probably be elected. Many

that
would be a .wise move
for Mr. Fraine or Mr. Burdick to get
out of the race and unite in giving
the other the support that should be
given. Up to the present time noth
ing has been done, and what will be
done we are not prepared to state, but
there is a possibility that after the
primaries they will find that they
both defeated.
Prominent Man Spent Couple of Days
Here for First Time in Sixteen
Years.
J. L. Hjort, who is a candidate for
Secretary of State, was in the city for
a couple of days the first of the week.
He arrived here Saturday and spent
Sunday here, leaving Tuesday. Mr.
Hjort is fii.e gentleman to meet, and
comes before the people of the
highly recommended for the position
he aspires to. His home is in Adams
county, where he has large business
interests. He served one or two
terms in the state legislature and
made a most enviable record. He is
a polished gentleman and during his
brief stay here he made many friends.
From all we can learn he is amply
qualified for the position he seeks and
is deserving of the suffrage of the
Republican voters at the June primari
es.
Local Nurses School Makes Nice
Showing.
The graduating exercises for nurses
of the General Hospital took place at
the church of the Advent Friday even,
ing. There was a large attendance
and Rev. F. H. Oehler delivered a
very fine sermon. After the exercises
at the church the guests gathered at
the hospital, where a splendid prog
ram was rendered. Addresses were
made by Rev. Torbet and Dr. Pep
pard, and a fine musical program was
rendered. After this there was a re
ception in the parlors of the nurses'
home and here the diplomas were pre
sented by Dr. W. F. Sihler and Miss
Clark, who is superintendent of the
hospital. The parlors were beautiful
ly decorated with flowers and after
the reception dainty refreshments
were served by the reception commit
tee. The nurses who graduated and
received their diplomas were: Misses
Ida Lennis, Esther Lockton and Marie'
Nielson. The manner in which the
whole affair was conductcd reflects
much credit on Superintendent Clark
and those corrected with this fine in
stitution.
