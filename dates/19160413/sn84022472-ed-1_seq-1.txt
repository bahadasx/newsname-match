U-BOAT CASES IS

State Department Busied
With Decoding of Official

MORE EVIDENCE TO
BE GATHERED HERE
Germany's Admissions In
Some Cases Will Aid
Work of State Dept.
',- ' ," - : --
t Washington; April 13 The Ger
man : note on the Sussex and other
submarine cases has been received at
the state department and was being
decided today. It probaby will be
laid before President Wilson and
Stvcretary Ldnsing before night.
The, affidavits from Paris and Lon
don, expected today on the liner St.
PaVl, will be considered in connection
with the German- note, and the "in
formation regarding attacks on mer
chant ' vessels since the Lusitania , dis
aster - is expected to ;ie completed in
time to come withiii the next' week.
While awaiting the official text
of the note, administration officials
were carefully examining statements
in the unofficial - fext received . from
Berlin and - were comparing 1 them
with evidence already at hand." .
Germany's admissions that her
submarines recently torpedoed three
merchant ships carrying Americans
and that one of - them . attacked a
Vessel near the point where the Sus
sex met disaster, simplifies the work
of th state department in preparing
for the next step of this country in
the submarine controversy. Officials
make it plain that this JStep rests on
the, accummulation .ok evidence that
American lives -axe constantly vd dan
ger in violation- of their rights.
- -'I?he United -States will continue, to
compile evidence indicating that Ger
man submersibles are - operating in
violation of xthe fules of international
law.. Instructions to Ambassador
Gerard, designed as a final word of
this government on ithe subject, will
be- up . for deliberation, ' it is -said. ,
The full text of the- German note
and the entire submarine situation
will be discussed at tomorrow's cab
inet meeting. v --
While Germany denies the Sussex
was torpedoed by one of her subma
rines and explains that a sketch made
by submarine commander of a ship
he torpedoed did not tally with the
description of the Sussex officials say
that Germany's admission that a sub
marine was in the vicinity coupled
with the array of evidence at hand
points to the conclusion that the Sus
sex was torpedoed.; , '
Xdkewise of ficials say there : is a
conflict between "the evidence in the
German version that . the steamers
Englishman and Eagle Point were
sunk after ' they attempted to escape
and' evidence received here f rdm other
sources. Germany's - contentions in
the cases of the steamers Berwlndvale
and the Manchester Engineer are not
considered here as conclusive.
(The unofficial text of the Ger
man note on the Sussex and other
submarine cases will be found on
Page 3 of The Farmer today.) . ,
LONDON VIEW OF NOTE.
London, April 13 Although the
London evening newspapers print the
German reply to the United States on
submarine warfare under such heads
as "Vain endeavor to . gull American
public," "Amazing American , note"
and "Berlin eats its own words," the
Westminster Gazette is the only One to
comment on the note. It says:
"We don't know whether the . Ger
mans believe that, hard-headed Amer
icans will take seriously, explanations
so childish. If we so fancy they have
done "less than justice to the American
nation. .

Controversy As to Whether
Injunction Against Crim
inal Act Should Lie May
Be Taken to Court of Last
Resort.
Superior Court Judge Holds
That Pickets of Machin
ists 'J Union Have Been
"Violating Statute Against
Inimidation.v
In a sweeping order Judge ia.ger, in
the superior court, issues a temporary
injunction against Bridgeport lodge,
No 30, Machinists, George Bowen,
business agent of the lodge, an dvp tri
ers, restraining them from picketing
the neighborhood of the Max Ams
Machine Co.,- for the purpose of pre
venting eltheir "by threats, intimida
tion, "or otherwise" persons from en
tering the employ of the company .
The court says the strikers have
indulged in conduct in "the nature of
intimidation and says they have vio
lated the provisions of Chapter 202,
Acts 909, which is st penal statute ior
bidding intimidation, or following ia a
disderly manner. -The offense is
described, and the "penalty sis fixed at
$100, or not more than six months.
The decision raises once more In
Connecticut the ancient controversy of
whether an injunction should issue to
prevent acts that are criminal, and
the offender subject to punishment
when the offense is proved.
- The strike leaders heard -of the in
junction with interest today, and the
view was expressed that the case
would be taken to the court of last re
Sort, in ' an effort to show at least
that the Injunction should not run be
yond the terms of the statute, sO as to
forbid picketing for the purpose- of
lawful persuasion.
The statute, reads: ' "
Every person who shall threat
! en, or use any means calculated
or intended to intimidate any per
son to compel such person against
' his will, to do or abstain from
doing any act which such person
has a legal right to do, or shall v
persistently follpw such person in
. . a disorderly manner, or injure or,
threaten to injure his property, .
,. with intent to intimidate him, .
' or threaten to injure his property,
with Intent to intimidate him,;
shall be fined not more than $100,!
or imprisoned not more than six
months. , - ? .' -'-

Washington, April j 13 Oenera,! Carranza, head of the de,
facto .government in Mexico, today-asked the United 'States to
withdraw its troops from Mexico and leave the pursuit of Villa i
to the Garranzista forces.
The request was embodied in a long note delivered at the
State Department through Elizio Arredondo, Garranza's ambas-1

In official quarters it was stated that, while the note is be-;
ing discussed, American troops will not be withdrawn, but, on!
the contrary, the pursuit of Villa will be pushed with vigor.
The receiptof the request for the withdrawal of United:
States troops puts a new aspect on a situation already most!
complexed, and officials declined to predict what course would
be taken until the Mexican note receives thorough study.
, . Lansing to Handle Negotiations ''
' The negotiations will be "handled exclusively by Secretary
Lansingj'pf the State Department. Secretary of War Baker said1
ha was unable to comment on the Carranza, hote, because the
questions involved were entirely administrative.
It is the contention of the Carranza' government that the
crossing of the international boundary by American troops was

been given. : '
Some state department officials con
fessed that Carranzasjote was not a
surprise. ' . " '
V Counsellor Polk confirmed the state
ment in the note that when he aekot3
for use of the Mexican railways it waa
"temporarily, unsatisfactory" but was
coupled with an expression of surprise
that the United States had not await
ed final approval of the pending pro
tocol before sending troops across the
border. - ' ' '
t was declared . officially, however,
that no formal protest against 'the en
try of General Pershing's columns had
been . previously made by Carranza.
When the advance troops crocced at
Columbus, it was officially stated, .
Carranza general met them at the bor

or on behalf of his government.

to the American government, asking
that tho American troops be with

facto government of. Mexico contends
that as the American troops crossed
into Mexico without permission, they
should be withdrawn until a proper
f oormal compact can be. entered Into
between the" two governments. It Is
Insistently affirmed that, the previous
notes of. the American government em-r
phasized.the fact that permission for
reciprocal crossing of . the frontier
would be granted only. In the event of
the repetition of a raid similar to that
made by Villa at Columbus, Ni M.
The note was sent , to Blizeo Arre
dondo, theCarranza .representative in
Washington, with instructions for Its
delivery to Secretary Lansing, "so end
ing negotiations for a reciprocal cross
ing of troops ad asking for dlsoccupa
tlon of ";the territory- occupied by
American troops Jn, view oSf Villa's
party having been destroyed."
Throughout the -note the emphasis
was laid on-the fact that the Am'erican
expedition was undertaken under- a
misunderstanding. - . , ' , . "
What was intended by the note of
March 10, it Is . pointed out, was to
submit - a proposal "by- means of
which the forces of one country (hould
reciprocally cross the dividing line In
to the other's in pursuit of bandits 11
unfortunately there should be re
peatedly along the border acts like
those committed in Columbus." .'
The note adds, however:
. "From the beginning the Mexican
government judged that by reason ol

the purpose of treating a case already
passed, the said incident could not
continue as a proposal for the recipro
cal passing of troops. - ;

- On . March 18, the . statement con
tinues, Frank Polk,, acting secretary!
of state, in an interview with the Car-j
ranza confidential agent deplored not
having the observations of the Mexi
can government before American
troops . crossed the border, declaring ; .
that the passage of troops took place !
In. the best of faith and in the belief j
that it would not : be . necessary to en-;
ter into more details of an agreement j
which was - considered definite - and
ended.' The declarations made by Mr.;
Polk were later confirmed oa March!
23 to the Mexican ' representative by j
Secuetary Lansing, . "who "stated also i
that he was sorry at having Interpret- f
ed wrongly the contents of the said
note in respect to' the passage of j
troops and that they would not ad-:
vance more to the south of the place
where they then were."
Reference is also made in the note
to the declaration made by President i"
Wilson on March 86, saying "the ex-',
peditlon' was ordered under an agree
ment with the de facto government!
of Mexico for the purpose only of cap
turing the bandit Villa,, whose forces
have Invaded territory of the United
States, and on no pretext Would we
order an Invasion of that republic or;
a violation of the sovereignty. -
"That Idea," continues the note,
"published by his excellency, Presi-.
dent Wilson, was rectified March 81
by a message sent to our1 confidential
agent in Washington in' which he waa
Instructed . to call your attention to
the Idea indioated, since the note of
March 10 referred to the reciprocal
passage of troops only In case that
Incidents like those which occurred
at Columbus should be repeated."
In . conclusion, the note, which Is
signed by Candido Agutlar, secretary
for foreign affairs, - pointed out that
as the American expedition "has ful
filled its objecting Insofar as H will
be able to do ao, as the party -heade-d
by Villa baa already been dispersed
