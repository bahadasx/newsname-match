Don't miss the play, entitled

Program, Friday, April 14. This,
however, Is not the only special num

good work of both teachers and pu
pils to get up this program. We hope
everybody will attend and give their
hearty support. An admission of
25c will be charged.
Mr. Hughes I uproving.
A letter was receivod from Thomas
Hughes In his own ha.idwriting. This
Is his second attempt, to write since
lie took sick. He r.tates that all he
has to do Is to eat and sleep. If you
can't eat or aren't hungry they choke
it down you. We naturally suppose
Tom Is getting fat. He doesn't like
it because lone beat Heppner in the
first baseball game'. Maybe if he
had been here it would not have hap
pened. The doctors took an X-Ray
picture of his lungs last week. They
say his left lung is perfectly clear,
but didn't Bay as to the right lung.
They give him gas twice a week and
will soon have his right lung col
lapsed. These few lines from Mr.
Hughes were a source of pleasure to
the school.
The Baseball Game.
The game started at about 2
o'clock with lone at the bat. Mr.
Hughes, as pitcher, mowed them
down in one, two, three order. Em
mett is climbing to the top notch on
the pitching process.
The Heppner boys hit the ball
quite often, but It seems lone was
sadly "out of luck." "Ole" Peter
son, the Swede, planted the ball over
beyond the stock yards and It was
some time before it was found. Ole
had to stop on 2nd. The lineup for
this game was somewhat changed
from the one played at lone, so it

FOR YEAR
I. SERVICE
FOR COMMON PEOPLE
Robert Service of Baker, who is a
candidate for public service commis
sioner at the coming primary elec
tion, was in Heppner this week in the
interests of his candidacy. While
here he made the following statement
which pretty clearly outlines his plat
form and his qualifications for the
office:
In coming out for this important
office I do so conscious of the fact
that it is to the common people alone
that I must look for my election, if
at all, for I have hammered the rail
roads too often when they were
wrong to expect their support.
The railroads are entitled to' and
should be given a "square deal,"
they also should be required to con
duct the business honestly, without
discrimination and at reasonable
rates.
They should be required to give
their exclusive attention to the bus
iness for which they were chartered
instead of expending huge sums, as
operating expenses, in undertaking
the moulding of public opinion
through publicity departments, the
conduct of legislation and the man
ipulation of elections.
High official salaries should be lim
ited to the value of the service ren
dered. They should be permitted to earn
a reasonable net return upon their
judiciously expended actual invest
ment, but no interest should be paid
on watered stocks and bonds, for
such fictitious liabilities have no
investment and have no earni::s
right; yet these carriers stand bold
ly before the public today, capital
ized at about $4.00 to $1.00 outlay,
demanding inlerest returns on their
entire capitalization, water includ
ed. There is approximately three bil
lions of dollars of actual money in
tills Nation, and the railroads doing
their cash business put every dollar
of It through their casli tills each
year, taking their toll from It as it
passes through.
In 1SS0 every man, woman and
child in the United States paid, in
railroad transportation tolls, the av
erage sum of $11.57, in 1913 it was
$32.20, while for Oregon it was about
$40.00.
Rates in Oregon range about 1
to 10 times higher than was charged
on the first primitive railroad operat
ed by steam and opened to public
traffic.
Grain and flour, for a 25-mile haul
on the primitive railroad, was 75c
per ton, on the O.-W. R. & N. it is
$1.20, while on the S. V. R'y it is
$3.80.
All merchandise L. C. L. shipments
on the primitive was $1.25, on the
O.-W. R. & N. it is $8.13' and on the
S. V. R'y, $13.23.
Engineer hire, to produce a like
amount of tonnage, cost the primi
tive road seventeen times the mod
ern cost.
With an Increasing population, in
creasing tonnage, and decreasing
cost of tonnage movement, rates
should be reduced; but Instead they
are Increased higher and higher, un
til the people's life blood is being
drained to exhaustion through the
vein of transportation taxation. This
shows the need of regulation by one
who knows, and pride for any local
candidates should be a secondary
consideration to fitness for the place.
I have had five years experience
as an expert accountant, sixteen
years of a successful Manufacturing
and Wholesale business career, and
eight years in the study and prac
tice of law almost exclusively on the
subject of Railroad Rate Regulation,
as my record shows.
I should like to represent the
masses one term.
My slogan on the primary ballot
is: "Regulate, give a fair return on
honest capital, nothing on watered
stock." 1

CANADIANS ARE ON
LOOKOUT FOR SPIES
W. P. Leuch of Hardman Receives a
Letter From Brother Who Tells of
Kfforts Being Made by England
to Enlist Recruits. War
Prices There Also.
W. P. Leach of Hardman has re
ceived a letter from his brother Gro
ver, who is now In Winnepeg, Can
ada. Mr. Leach describes conditions
there and tells of the suspicion with
which all strangers coming Into that
country are now looked upon. We
print the letter herewith in part:
"Dear Brother Will: 1 arrived
here yesterday from the west coast
via Prince Rupert over the Grand
Trunk railroad; was one solid week
on the road so was glad to get off
the train. I think I will go to work
for the Canadian Northern railroad
as I have made out the application
blanks. I expect to go out tomorrow
or the day after on a run to the east
coast. It takes me a week to make
the trip and I don't know yet how I
will like it.
"There is a big graft up here in
everything you take up and you have
to come through ever so often to hold
your own.
"There are soldiers everywhere up
here and the streets are crowded
with them. One is reminded at all
times that this country is at war and
that England expects every man to
do his duty. Posters reading like
'Dad is on the firing line, what
are you doing?' are stuck up In ev
ery imaginable place and It is amus
ing to read some the them. No two
are alike.
"I have been followed by a detec
tive from the moment I stepped from
the train. He has a room next to
mine in this hotel and takes his
meals at the same table and when I
go out for a walk he is right there.
While I am writing this letter he is
watching me from a desk across the
room. It makes a fellow feel like a
second Jesse James, but they watch
all strangers from outside countries
the same way, I am told."
Prosperity.
Everybody is looking for and want
ing prosperity.
The sermon at the Federated
church next Sunday at 11 a. m. will
be a Booster's sermon, answering the
question, "How can we better the fi
nancial, social, educational and spir
itual condition of our city, county,
state and nation." A sure remedy for
hard times. The county and city of
ficials, school teachers, doctors, law
yers, business men of all kinds, moth
ers, fathers, big and little children,
all have a special Invitation to come.
There will be good music. The
young people's society will have
charge of the evening service with a
special program, beginning at 7 p.
m. W. B. SMITH, Pastor.
Union Prayer Meeting Service.
The Federated and Christian
churches of Heppner will unite in
prayer services on Wednesday and
Thursday evenings of next week. The
Wednesday evening service will be
held In the Christian church and the
Thursday evening service in the Fed
erated church. These services will
be in charge of the missionary so
cieties of the two churches, and are
preparatory to the Easter services on
the Sunday following.

BALL TOSSERS

50-
lone Loses Second Came to Heppner
. 1 Making Brilliant Showing in !n
"! itial Contest. Hughes is
Luminary Star.
The Heppner High school ball toss
ers won the second game of the In
terscholastic series at the depot
grounds in this city Saturday after
noon by the one-sided score of 13 to
i. The final count would have, no
doubt, been different had the Egg
City stickers been able to connect
with Emmet Hughes' now famous
"mush ball." It is the regular old
time spitter. On the other hand, the
local batters fell heavily against the
slow curves of "Fat" Blake and the
results on more than one occasion
were the basses full and none down.
The lone boys made many costly
errors. In the seventh inning Blake
in the box exchanged places with
Pennington As catcher and the change
proved a temporary relief but didn't
help the lone players in connecting
with the ball. Hughes for Heppner
was plainly the star of the game,
striking out 23 of the lone batters.
Hughes uses a spit ball which is very
baffling and he uses a world of speed.
Saturday was the first time In which
he attempted to pitch an entire game.
His first experience was at lone a
week ago when he went in for three
inlngs to relieve Peterson.
The last game of the Interscholas
tic series will be played in lone Sat
urday. The season was rushed
through in a hurry this year in order
that the track season could be prop
erly taken care of. The two teams
have each won a game and Satur
day's contest will prove the cham
pionship for the 1916 season.
Fire in Borg Building.
A fire In the rear end of the Borg
building on Main street Tuesday eve
ning which would have resulted dis
astrously had It not been discovered
in the nick of time, caused some lit
tle damage to the personal effects of
Richard Davis, a colored man. Mr.
Davis had just moved into the build
ing. About 7 o'clock in the evening
he made a fire In a sheet iron stove
in his room, put iu several large
pieces of coal and went off to the
theater where he was leading man
in a hypnotizing contest. The stove
was apparently only six inches from
the wall and after becoming red hot,
the wall paper was ignited. Glenn
Wells, who was In his law office in
the front of the building, had his at
tention first attracted by a crackling
sound and upon Investigation discov
ered the blaze, lie at once turned in
the alarm, but in the meantime with
two buckets of water subdued the
fire. Mr. Davis lost three suits of
clothes as a result of the conflagra
tion. He carried no insurance.
Christian Church.
The subject of the morning ser
mon Sunday will be "Our Calling and
Election." Any one having trouble
with the question of "predestination"
will have their difficulties scriptural
ly settled.
In the evening will preach on
"God's Appointments."

Child Welfare Exhibit in November.
Cemetery Will be Improved.
J. L. Wilkins Resigns
l'Yoni Presidency.
The Oregon Child Welfare Com
mission will be in Heppner with their
traveling exhibit next November on
the 25th. This was the announce
ment made by Secretary Smead of
the Heppner Commercial Club at the
regular meeting on Monday evening.
Mr. Smead has been corresponding
with the Commission and an attempt
was first made to have the exhibit
here for the county fair In Septem
ber, but inasmuch as this date had al
ready been filled, he was advised by
Mrs. Robert II. Tate, of Portland,
president of the commission that a
later date was possible and November
25th has been agreed upon. The ex
hibit will be sent to fifty cities In the
state, beginning some time this
month.
A communication from the Port
land Chamber of Commerce was read
which asked the local club to take
some action with other commercitl
bodies of the state to prevent the
pending railroad strike. The local
club drew up a set of resolutions ask
ing the railroad employees to submit
to arbitration.
The club recommended to the City
council of Heppner that the 25th day
of April be set aside as a general
clean-up day. The recommendations
will be placed before the council at
their next regular meeting. Many
cities and towns the entire country
over have Inaugurated an annual
clean-up and paint-up day and the
result has been the transformation
of these places from dirt and filth
into cities of health and beauty.
Heppner has been observing this day
the past few years with noticeable
results.
Robert E. Smith of Roseburg spoke
on taxation and the value in having
an organized taxpayers' leajsueIp
on his suggestion,' a committee" nasi
been appointed which will be known
as the taxation committee and they
will take up all matters pertaining
to taxes hereafter.
A committee was also appointed
which will have for its object the im
provement and beautifying of the Ma
sonic cemetery grounds. It is proba
ble that someone will he hired to
look after the lots and assessment
will be made to the owners of the
lots. This system is one that is fol
lowed in many places and appears to
be the best method of takng care of
the cemeteries.
At the conclusion of the meeting,
president J. L. Wilkins handed in his
resignation which was duly accepted
by the club. Mr. Wilkins gave as his
reason for resigning that business
men in the town do not take sufficient
interest in the club. His successor
will be chosen at the next regular
meeting.
