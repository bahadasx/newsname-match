Local Manager
is one of the most won
derful inventions of the
age. It is absolutely
unique. Never before
has there been speed
without harm. Never before have women had any
thing which REALLY made dirt disappear as quickly,
as harmlessly, as EASILY as with this extraordinary
dirt loosener. It does HOURS work in MINUTES.
It positively will not fade colored clothes—shrink or
harden woolen, and will not rot or weaken lace cur
tains so they tear easily, but keeps them STRONG
besides absolutely clean.

TF YOU DO, and your price and terms are reason
able, we can sell it. If we think your price is too
high, we will tell you so. Remember, we do not
want to list iarms that we know we cannot sell for
the purpose of tying up the farm. We want alive
active list of good farms that will sell. We cannot
make a dollar by simply listing—we refuse a great
many listings—it's the selling that counts. Our or
ganization of bringing buyers is second to none in
the Northwest. If there is any business going, we
will get our share. If we didn't think we could sell
your land, we would not spend money advertising
for it. We have customers now in sight for 160,
240, 320, 640, 960, 1280, 1600 and 1920 improved
sarms We don't list land all over the State, but
only want farms in Cass, Traill, Steele, Griggs and
Barnes Counties where we are operating. Now is
the time to list while we are here. We may be op
erating many miles from here by next year.

On the Subject of
Commercial Integrity
THE ItEO FOLKS RELIEVE— have always believed and from
the lirst have based the lleo Policy on the belief—that ulti
mate supremacy in the automobile industry will redound to
that concorn that has most scrupulously fulfilled its obliga
tions to its customers.
IT MATTERS N07 whether those obligations are assumed in
writing or merely implied in transactions as between man
and man—the Roo Folk hold them sacred.
IF THERE IS ANY REASON—aside from the inherent quali
ty and value of Met) cars—for the splendid Reo success, it
is to be found in tho reputation the Reo has for making
good its guarantees.
OF COURSE YOU KNOW- all the world knows—that the Reo
MotorCar Company is financially one of the strongest au
tomobile companies in the world.
AND YOU
A'iVOIV
Your
Dream of a Home
Can be more easily and more quick
ly realized if you will come and
talk with us about your plans.
For instance, wc show here the first
floor plan and an outside view of a very
attractive bungalow style of house. This
will make you a delightful home.
There is a cozy seat by the stairs in
the large living room, a built-in side
board in the dining room, and a fine
sleeping porch on the second floor.
You ought to see the second floor
plan. Come in and let us show you this
and other designs. Ask us to show you
Design C-8.

that it is also one of tho pioneers in the in­
dustry—so that financial strength is not due to lucky ohance
nor to a brief period of prosperity.
REO STANDING -financially and in the heart of buyers—is
the result of a policy lirmly founded in the beginning and
oonsintently carried out through along period of years.
RUT ALL THAT WOULD NOT MATTER if the heart of the
Reo were not sound.
IT WOULD NOT MATTER how much money there was back
of the Reo guarantee if there were not also Reo Integrity
and Reo Good Intent.
THAT IS WHY, knowing the Reo Folk and their ideals, you
will feel safer in selecting a Reo than any other car of simi
lar size or price class.
SPEAKING OF SIZE—do you realize what a big, as well as
beautiful car is that New Reo Six?
IT'S A FULL SEVEN-PASSENGER CM«-12«-inch wheel
base and on cantilever springs, giving the fullest passenger
space and the utmost in luxurious qualities.
DEMAND IS TREMENDOUS—and output of this 7-passenger
Six is limited. So if you'd have the utmost luxurious equip
age and the sweetest running car the Reo Folk ever turned
out, your order should bo in our hands at once. Today
won't be a minute too soon.
