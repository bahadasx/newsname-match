TO SINKING ALL
SAVE SUSSEX
Tells of Sinking Another Steam
er on that Date
DESCRIPTION ENTIRELYDIFFERENT
Other Steamers Referred to In Note
Were Sunk After They Had Tried
To Escape.
Washington, April 13. Germany's
formal denial of torpedoing the chan
nel steamer Sussex, given to Embassa
dor Gerard at Berlin, lias been made
public at the German capital and trans
mitted to America. It deals also with
the cases of several other steamers,
which the statement asserts were
sunk legally after attempting to es
cape and after the crew had taken to
the boats. An offer is made to lay the
Sussex 'matter before an Impartial
tribunal to determine the facts.
The German note as far as it deals
with the Sussex is as follows:
The French steamer Sussex As
certainment of the fact whether the
channel steamer Sussex was damaged
by a German submarine was rendered
extremely difficult because no exact
details of time, place and attendant
circumstances of the sinking were
known and also because it was impos
sible to obtain a picture of the ship
before April 6. ConseriueuMy the inves
tigation had to be extended to all ac
tions undertaken on the day in ques
tion March 24 in the channel in the
general region between Folkestone
and Dieppe.
"In that region on March 21 a long
black craft without a flag, having a
gray funnel, small gray forward works
and two high masts, was encountered
about the middle of the English chan
nel by a ..German .submarine. The
German commander reached the def
inite conclusion that it was a war
vessel, and, indeed, a mine layer of
the recently-built English Arabis
class. Ho was led to that conviction
by the following facts: First, by the
plain, unbroken deck of the ship; sec
ond, the form of the stern, sloping
downward and backward like a war
vessel; third, she was painted like a
war vessel; fourth, the high speed de
veloped, about 18 knots; fifth, the cir
cumstance that the veMel (H I not
keep a course northward of the light
buoys between Dungoness and Beachy
Head, which, according to the fre
quent and unvarying observations of
German submarines, is about the
course of commercial vessels, but
kept in the middle of the channel, on
a course about In the direction of Lo
Havre.
"Consequently, ho attached the ves
sel at 3.55 in the afternoon, middle
European time, 1 1-2 sea miles south

east of Bull Rock (Bullock?; bank,
the submarine being submerged. The
torpedo struck and caused such a vlo
Ki t explosion in the forward part of
l l-i that the entire forward part
vuS fy.iway 10 tlle bridge. The
particuiv. .ient explosion warrants
the certain ""?v"-,sion that great
amounts of munu. "ere aboard.
"The German com., aner made a
sketch of the vessel attacked by him,
two drawings of which are inclosed.
The picture of the steamer Sussex,
two copies of which are also inclosed,
is reproduced photographically from
the English paper, the Daily Graphic
of the 27th ultimo. A comparison of
the sketch and the picture shows that
the craft attacked is not identical with
the Sussex; the ditference in tne po
sition of the stack and shape of the
stein is particularly striking.
"No other attack whatever by Ger
man submarines at the time in ques
tion for the Sussex upon the route be
tween Folkestone and Dieppe oc
curred. The German government must
therefore assume that the injury to
the Sussex is attributable to another
cause than an attack by a German
submarine.
"For an explanation of the case the
fact may perhaps be serviceable that
no less than 2t English mines were
exploded by shots by German naval
forces In the channel on the 1st and
2d of April alone. The entire sea in
that vicinity is, in fact, eudangered by
floating mines and by torpedoes that
have not sunk. Off the English coact
it is further endangered in an in
creasing degree through German
mines which have been laid against
enemy naval forces.
'Should tho American government
have at its disposal further material
for a conclusion upon the case of the
Sussex, the German government
would ask that it be communicated
in order to subject this material also
to an Investigation.
"In the event that differences of
opinion should develop hereby be
tween the two governments, the Ger
man government now declares itself
rcadv; to have the facts of the case es
tablished through mixed commissions
of investigation in accordance with
the third title of The Hague agree
ment for the peaceful settlement of
international conllicts, November 18.
1!H)7.
As to the other ships covered by the
German note, the Manchester Engi
neer, the Englishman. Bcrmindval
and the Eagle 1'olnt, the sinking of all
of them is admitted after each o
them had tried to run away. Time
was given in each case for the crews
to escape.
A True Angler Hath Fallen
The deatli in Bennington, Vermont.
April 2 of Leonard Hyde Godfrey, at
the prime age of 2i! has removed from
our midst, one who was a true disciple
of the. beloved Isaac, a lover of the
great out doors, and u woodsman.
To have known him, was to have
loved him, because of his cheerful
dispOFition and straightforwardness.
Whether ill business or along the trail
this young son of Vermont ever im
pressed one as being a gentleman of
sterling character, fearlessly aggres
slve, courageous and sweet of mind.
Even in his great illness, which
must hao caused him hours of suf
fcring, and when hope seemed to hang
in the balance, he remained cheerful
and talked only of the time when In
would be well and strong again
Shielding a young wife as much as
possible from sorrow, he was a noble
husband indeed.
But. with the odds heavily against
hint;' our young friend struggled lr
vain, and death came as a welcome re
lease, with loved ones gathered about
1 him. The A prll sun had reached it's
zenith and Vermont's fair hills and
valleys lay bathed In sunshine
As a sportsman, Mr. Godfrey was tin
finest type, enjoying a dav in the
field with cither rod or gun, the hap
limit being always of secondary im
portance. The writer has spent much
time fishing and hunting with him and
counts many of these outings anion?
tlie most enjoyable of his own career
s a fly-fisherman our young frleni'
excelled, and probably few anglerf
had at his age, mastered the art so
thoroughly. Ills vast amount of
knowledge of the different flies and
their usage was amazing and testified
to the careful study which he gave to
nature and the Great Outdoors.
nd now, even though the man has
passeil on to that life beyond, there
will dwell In the minds and hearts of
his fellow-sportsman, fond memories of
numberless happy hours spent with
him In the field and on tlie streams
and surely they will unite in saying;
"Sleep on, dear friend and take thy
rest;
"God has called thee, He thought It
best."

Bandit Acts As Though Fe Might
Be Alive
AMERICANS WERE HIS VICTIMS
Villa and His Party Now Seem To Be
Headed North and On Way
Toward Texas.
El Paso, Tex.. April 13. A band of
Villa followers numbering several
hundred and possibly Iu00, have sack
ed Sierra Mojada, five miles across the
Couhuila line ami 80 miles east of
Jimiuez, destroying many thousands
of dollars worth of American property
and loutiug the town of everything of
value. This news, which may prove
to be of the highest importance, as it
Is believed in El Paso, Tex., possibly
Villa himself was among the raiders,
was received there yesterday by the
representative of one of the largest
American mining concerns in Mexico
and is accepted by him us authentic. !
Tlie bandits made their attack on
tho town on the 5th. They came from
Escalon, a junction point on tlie Mex
ican National railroad, 00 miles south
east of Jiminez and about an equal
distance southwest of Sierra Mojada.
which has its connection by the Mex
ican Northern railroad. On their way
to Sierra Mojada they sacked the
small town of CorrlUo.
The belief that Villa himself may
be directing the operations of the
bandits is sui ported by a report re
ceived yesterday from Ojinaga stat
ing t hat Col. Rlojas, the commander
there, had information that Villa had
doubled in his tracks and was 200
miles southwest of that town. Ojin
aga is directly across the border from
Presidio, Tex., and about 1".0 miles
north of Sierra Mojada.
Another circumstance that gives
color to this location of the bandit
chief is tlie fact that Canuto Reyes,
at the bead of a lare nnmber of men.
was reported from Torreon a week
ago to be traveling nortli in the direc
tion of Sierra Mojada. It was the
belief at the time in Torreon that
Villa's ally was on his way to Join his
chief. If it proves true, Villa lias
evaded the American troops who have
been driving south at an amazing
speed, and were yesterday reported.
from reliable sources, to be well south
of Parral, and close to the Dtirango
border.
Sierra Mojada is 140 miles east of
the nearest point at which American
troops are known to be. It is on the
partem side of a vast desert, known
as the Bulson Mapiml and south of
another dreary waterless waste called
Poison Deloslipanes. Its only connec
tion with the west is by the Mexican
Northern railroad, along which the
bandits advanced, burning bridges, de
stroying telegraph lines and tearing
up the tracks as far as they were
able.

Pretty Home Wedding Wednesday at
Old Bennington.
A pretty home wedding took place
at 3 o'clock Wednesday afternoon
when Miss Hazel Eva Russell became
the bride of Frederic Holton at the
home of the brides' parents, Mr. and
Mrs. Clinton E. Russell in Old Ben
nington. The ceremony was performed by
Rev. Isaac Jennings in a homo taste
fully decorated for tho occasion by
potted ferns and Easter lilies and the
single ring service was used.
The bride was given In marriage by
her father, Clinton E. Russell, Miss
Estella Russell, a sister of the bride,
acting as bridesmaid, and Frank Bak
er as best man.
Miss Russel wore a gown of white
crepe de chine and carried white
roses. The gown of the bridesmaid
was pink crepe de chine and she car
ride pink carnations. The bride's go
ing away gown was blue, with hat to
match.
Mr. and Mrs. Holton received many

NO PRIMARY NOMINATION
No
Presidential Names May
In G. O. P. Column.
Appear
. Vermont's first presidential prim
ary will be held Tuesday, May 16.
This will give only about three weeks
in which t i collect returns for the
election of delegates before the meet
ing of the republican national conven
tion. The present Indications are that
no republican nomination for presi
dent will he filed lor this primary
election, says the Montpelier corres
pondent of the Springfield Republican.
This extraordinary condition of af
fairs is due to the fact that the only
three men who would have sufficient
following according to present indica
tions to secure the signatures on the
ballot are not likely to give their
names on the ballot and are not likely
to give the necesary written consent.
These men arts Charles E. Hughes,
Theodore Roosevelt and Eliliu Root.
Reports from all sections of the
state indicate a very general desire
that Justice Hughes shall be made the
candidate. As there will be a blank
column on the ballot it is expected
that very many will write in the name
of Justice Hughes. This may be done
to some extent for Roosevelt and
Root, but the indications are that
Hughes is the choice of a large ma
jority of Vermont republicans. On
the democratic ticket there will be no
opirosition to President Wilson.

Carranza's Consul Says We Should
Get Out of Mexico.
El aso, Tex.. April 11. Gen. Gabriel
Gavira, Carranza commander at
Juarez, last night announced that the
forces of the delacto government were
in a position to take immediate control
or the Villa situation if the American
troops withdrew. Gen Gavira's state
ment was made in connection with the
announcement of Maj-Gen Hugh L.
Scott, chief of staff of the American
army office, that the purpose of the
expeditionary force would be consid
ered accomplished when the Villa
bands were dispersed or "as soon as
the troops of the de facto government
are able to relieve them of the work."
"We have more men than enough
now," said Gen Gavira. "If we were
able to overcome Villa wheu he had
70,(010 men, over 100 cannon and plen
ty of supplies, we ought to be able to
dispose of him now, when his numbers
have dwindled down to a few hundred.
But it is a big territory to operate
in, and a single man has more chance
to escape and hide than a large forcw
would have. However, on account of
Villa's wounded condition, we think ho
will lie taken soon. If not, it is hard
ly likely that without proper surgical
"are he will survive long."
