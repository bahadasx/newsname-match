While nothing Is obtainable regard
Iris General Funston's announcement
Jit. San Antonio that the army soon
would make a change that would ef
fect the line of communications. It Is
UffBPPted that there is at least one
route east of El Paso that would meet
the needs of the army, particularly
if the railroads are not to be fully and
openly used for transportation. This
U an automobile road that leaves the
border southeast of Fabens, Texas,
following a course some ISO miles
lorn; that ends in Chihuahua City.
The army has heard from various
Private individuals that this is an ex
cHlcnt automobile road, far superior
to thp Columbus-Casas Orandps road.
Iteports have been emanating re
cently from Presidio, Texas, that a
-'00 mile road from the border to Chi
huahua City soon would be utilized by
the army as a line of communications.
If a new line of communication is
established, lp )H pointed out here, new
troops might be used In putting it
into effect. This would permit the
utilization of the troops along the
present line of communications for the
reinforcing of (icneral Pershing's ad
vanced columns.

EFFORT TO HAVE

IRV UORNINO JOURNAL RPRfilAL LRARflO WIRIt
Washington, April 1 -. Senator

attack on the army bill with a denun
ciation of politicians who, he declar
ed, were trying to tempt Justice
Hughes with a presidential nomina
tion. "Partisan politics," do, hired the
California senator, "Is ruthless In Its

Ihe supreme court of the I'nited

bring the highest judicial tribune of
the country or any member of It Into
polities should be resented not only
by the member to whom the tempting
offer la made but by the whole coun
try. "To my mind II is of the gravest
Importance that the great tribunal
should be separated absolutely and
forever from politics, candidacy for
officii or any interest In elections be
yond thai of the disinterested and
patriotic private citizen."
"Whether Justice Hughes is going
to allow his name to be used as a can

profound Interest and of great Im
portance I,, the country at large.
Whether onoe man or another is nam

Concern of army offlcinla on tlifl

officially stated that Heneral Funstoil
had complete authority for any move

guard the United States advance col
umns and their lines. Heneral Heott,
chief of staff, while denying1 that any
orders to send more troops Into Mex

thority from Washington and hiul

that the president wan not consider
