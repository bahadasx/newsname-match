last Saturday at the home of her par

not going to grumble since we hav<

We're not feeling vely wel this mor

us last night, and we're nearly frost

Shower for Miss Boggs
One of the mostdelightful affairs of the
season was the miscellaneous shower
iven for the popular bride-to-be, Miss
laka Bog s, at the home of Mrs. G.
R. Hendricks, on last Tuesday after
noon. All the young ladies of the town
were present and a number of tables
were arranged throughout the roonis
for progressive games which were
greatly enjoyed for about an hour.
Miss Lorena Taylor was the lucky win-.
ner of the prize. After the games the
guests were invited to the dining-room
which was beautifully decorated with
yellow and white. In the center of the
table was a large yellow covered box
surrounded by snmill yellow baskets,
each filled with rice and attatched to
the big box by a white ribbon., Each
guest was given a basket and told to
pull when the top of the box came off
and was found to be tilled with presents.
for the bride. On each basket, which
were issued as favors, was perched a
"blue bird, " the emblem for "happ>i
i.ess." Block creim and cake in tho
color scheme of yellow and white were
served. Mrs. Hendricks is anl ideal
hostess. She was assisted by Moss
dames J. P. Carey, J r., L. C. Thornley,
T. J. Mauldin, C. B. HIagood and Miss;
Emily Thornley. As the guests left
they "showered" the bride with rice.
