Wonderfully Endowed by Nature

) Mr. Richard II. Edmonds, edi
tor of the Baltimore Manufactur
ers' Record, who spent the winter
in beautiful Daytona, gives out
the following about the destiny
of our state :
"Let me start by saying that in
my opinion Florida is mow enter
ing upon a realization of its great
possibilities. It is an unique
state, having no duplicate in A
menca. It lsas I said sonic
months ago, one of the 'greatest
assets of the nation.
"This state hardlv belongs to
its own citizens.
"It is a great national property
of infinite value to the whole
country and in Florida hundreds
of thousands and ultimately mil
lions of citizens of other states
will spend a part or all the win
ter. Tens of thousands of peo
ple of moderate means as well as
the rich will own their winter
homes in Florida.
"More and more will these
facts grow upon the country. The
rate at which this movement will
, expand will depend upon the peo
ple now living in Florida and the
railroads of the state.
"Persistent effort should be
mads to let people all over the
country understand the advan
tages of having homes in Florida
with a view to spending six to
eight months of a year here, and
spend the summers elsewhere if
they so desire. There are tens
of thousands of fairly well to dp
people who want to live quietly in
a country of good climate and
who long to -be away from harsh
winters. They have reached an
age where they desire to get out
of business and settle down to the
fullest enjoyment of I advancing
years.,
"Florida is the ideal place for
1hem. It is not too far away, as
is California, and here people are
not cut off from the world as out
on the Pacific coast.
"The amazing growth of Cali
fornia is largely due to the settle
ment of this class of people from
the central west and the east, and
Ihey went to California because
thry hal never been made ac
quainted with Florida's superor-j
ity.

ine ease oi nouseKeeping in
one's own home or in rented
furnished homes, the abundance
of fruits and vegetables and fish,
the. exceptional advantages for
raising poultry combine to make
it possible to have every comfort
and luxury in the food line.
"All of these facts should be
impressed with unceasing energy
upon the whole country and the
railroads and the towns that fail
to make this a conspicuous part
ot their work, and to advertise it
lreely and persistently will fall
short of their opportunity.
"As one of the tourist points of
Honda, the region from Ormond
to New Smyrna, on the mainland
and on the peninsula can be made
a focussing region for great pro
gress. Some of the things sug
gested about this region will ap
ply to many other parts of the
state also.
"In a section so wonderfully
endowed by nature for becoming
a region ot surpassing beauty, at
tention should be given to the
largest possible development of
the idea of the "City Beautiful."
This section should become a ver
itable flower garden whose fame
.should be as wide as is that of
Portland, Oregon, for its roses.
In order to do this, there should
be a friendly but active rivalry
in growing flowers and beautify
ing yards front and back.
"The superb shade trees should
be as zealously guarded as in
some New England towns where
a man cannot cut a tree on his
own ground without the consent
of tho authorities. Every tree on
the streets should be saved from
ruthless injury by those who do
not appreciate what the trees
mean to this section.
"Great is Florida limitless are
its opportunities for bringing
millions of people here to escape
the death dealing blizzards, the

A representative of a large con
cern which furnishes paper to
printing establishments, stated to
the writer that he ' anticipated
more failures and suspensions a
mong newspapers and printing
offices within the next ninety
days than forthe entire 'period
covered by the past several years.
Paper and all other material used
in printing have gone to such
ruinously high prices that there
has never been a period in the
history of the printing business
when it was so hard to make the
amount received for a piece of
printing cover even the cost of
production, much less afford a
profit. On many grades of paper
used for printing the price re
cently has advanced 100 per cent.
and the same is true of ink, type,
metal, etc. Lakeland Telegram.
Knott's
First Job

Away from
Hon. W. C. Hargrove, a former
Clerk of the Circuit Court of Put
nam county, writes interestingly
to the Times-Herald of the time
when Hon. W. V. Knott, candi
date for Governor, took his first
job away from home, as Mr. Har
grove's Deputy Clerk, twenty
eight years ago. The gentleman
is living in California now on ac
count of his health, lut he is not
too tar away to be interested m
his former home and in the very
reliable associate ot whom he
says:
No man ever had a more com
petent, industrious, loyal associ
ate than I had in him; perfectly
temperate, in every habit, he was
equally so in his mental equip
ment; for cool, intelligent, well-
poiscd judgment I never knew
his superior for a man of his age.

matters of importance, but weigh-
1 1 ii n
eu every sme, and when he ar
rived at what he considered to be
right, neither money, nor self-in
tcivst, nor personal friendship
could swerve him from the doing
what he considered his duty.
fhat was twenty-eight veins
ago; hp was a young man then
working at his first job away
from home. Since then his ex
periences have been such as to
strengthen every trait I have
mentioned. He has served as
State Auditor, State Treasurer

in the cabinet of four Governors;,
and in all his work, he has taken
a firm stand for all matters per
taining to the best interest of, the
people, as you well know. J n fill
ing these various offices, ho has
never neglected any duty, nor
used time which was paid for by
the people to play politics for his
own advancement. Standing al
ways for the right and with his
rich experiences in helping to
handle State matters, he is fully
capable of giving the people the
best of service, and having known
him intimately ' for more than
twenty-five years, I know he
will." Jasper News.

Mr. Livestock Man, would you
like to attend a big livestock in -
stitute? The University of Flor -
ma win hold an institute some
time next fall if enough interest
is shown. Several livestock men
have expressed a desire for such
a meeting. John M. Scott, ani
mal industrialist to the Experi
ment Station, is sending letters
to livestock men to sense their in
terest. Any one who desires the
institute or has any suggestions
to make should correspond with
Mr. Scott at Gainesville. He will
furnish any information that may
be available from time to time.
s Among the problems that will
bo discussed are the cheapest
feeds for beef production, pas
ture grasses, the value of home
grown feeds compared with pur
chased feeds, what it costs to fat
ten a steer, bovine tuberculosis,
tick eradication, dipping vats and
their construction and use, silos
and silage, milk testing, dairy
records, dairy ' machinery, hog
cholera and the demonstration of
the use of hog cholera serum, dis
ease of farm animals and their
treatment. These and other live
stock subjects will be discussed
by those who have had actual ex
perience in the work.
The meeting will last two or
three days, according to the de
sires of the farmers. Whether or
not this institute will be held "will
depcid on the livestock men. Any
one who desires that it be held
should not hesitate to write Mr.
Scott at once.
Do Not Fire the Ranges
The wild lands are the farms
of posterity. The man who delib
erately sets fire to the forests or
prairies destroys the legacy of
his children. Florida land needs
the organic matter that the decay
ing vegetable matter on wild
land affords.
S. S. Walker, associate chemist
to the University of Florida, Ex
periment Station, cites three
phases of this wasteful practice
for the consideration of farmers.
The first is the destruction of or
ganic matter mentioned. The
other two are the destruction of
soil bacteria and the deforestation
of land. Millions of little pine
trees are killed y the fires and
the loss to the soil through the de
struction of organisms which ren
der plant food available cannot
estimated.
That range fires destroy cattle
ticks is a fallacy according to C.
K. McQuarry, state agent. The
ticks are usually dormant at the
time the fires take place and,
h.'nce, are hidden where they arc
not subjected to the fire. "
If fertilizers fail to make a crop
try an application of horse sense.
If" might be profitable to make the
Iat t f-r application first and it will
certainly be most profitable to
apply the two together.

Former Punta Gordan Writes
About Trip to Puerto Rico
Frederick W. Howard of Kin-
derhook, N. Y., a former resident
of Punta Gorda, after spending
the winter on the island of Puerto
Rico, writes interestingly about
conditions as he found them
there, particularly in the growing
of grapefruit, oranges and pine
apples, crops in which Florida ex
cels. Following extracts taken
from Mr. Howard's letter will be
of interest to Herald readers:
"My first visit to this tropical
possession of Uncle Sam has been
delightful, interesting, informing
and altogether indescribable. A
few words, however, would suf
fice to assure the South Florida
growers of fine oranges and pine
apples that they need have no
present fear of hurtful competi
tion from Puerto Rico in the pro
duction of these fruits.
"I saw some large groves of
velvet Beans uooa lor uover
r-
i vivu -
Those farmers who want a cov -
;er crop to grow among trees
' should consider early velvet
beans. A crop that does not
climb the trees is desirable. For
this reason cowpeas are frequent
ly used. But their seed ( are sub
ject to weevil and several fung
ous diseases injure them. ThQn
too, most of them are subject 'to
root-knot.
Velvet beans are liable to few
diseases and insect enemies, ex
cept the caterpillar; and if early
varieties are planted early they
will escape even this. For grove
planting, John Belling, assistant
botanist to the University of Flor
ida, Experiment Station recom
mends several early beans. The
first is the Georgia (called the
100-day velvet bean), which is a
sport of the Florida and is grown
extensively in Georgia. Planted
in April or May, its pods are ripe
from August to September. It
does not climb much. Except for
its earliness, small size and small
er branches, it resembles the Flor
ida, from which its seeds cannot
be distinguished. Seed may be
obtained from Georgia and Flori
da seedsmen.
The Yokohama bean is nearly
as early as the Georgia, but has
thick hulls, and probably bears a
less quantity of seed. It, too, is
a small plant and does not climb
much.
The Wakulla bean has thin
hulls and larger pods than the
Georgia. It is free from the ob
jectionable velvet. It is exactly
as early as the Yokohama, but
gives a larger crop of seeds.
Planted in early May, the seeds
will mature iif September.,
Scholarships Offered in Polk and
DeSoto Counties
The boys' short course at the
University of Florida is growing
'steadily. Of course it will not be
held until some time next fall,
but, unlike other meetings, the at
tendance caii be estimated pretty
closely beforehand. Every coun
ty which has a club will be repre
sented, and it looks as if every
county in the State will have a
club. Most of the first prizes
this year will be scholarships.
The latest scholarships an
nounced by G. L. Herrington,
state club agent, are for Polk and
DeSoto counties. They are offer
ed by the Charlotte Harbor and
Northern Railroad. The road
runs through these two counties
and is interested in their agricul
tural development. One of the
best ways to obtain that end is
through club work, because the
scientific methods which boys
will learn now will reflect on the
counties in the future when the
boys have taken the places of
thi'ir fathers. Furthermore, each
boy'is tho nucleus for .a- better
farming community. He will not
only make a better farmer as a
result of his own information, but
by his influence in the community
he " will cause other farmers to
seek his methods.
oranges and grapefruit along he
northwest coast of the island in
apparently excellent state of -cultivation,
the trees still loaded
with ripe fruit (in the second
week of March). These groves
were sheltered by heavy wind-
breaks of live bamboo canes, fori
protection against the prevailing
winds and sometimes disastrous
gales from the sea. For the most
part the .orange trees are scatter
ed along the mountain slopes,
with little or no cultivation, and
the fruit is, with few exceptions,'
thick-skinned, very seedy and
more or less acid taste. Oranges

"The pineapples are all grown

'dominating, and are said to be
shipped in their season, in large
quantities, bearing transportation
very well. A finer and larger va

pounds in weight, spherical in
shape and of a light greenish col

"Shipment of all these fruits
was refused at one time during
my stay in Puerto Rico by some
lines of steamers, probably on ac
count of the increased production
of sugar on the Island and conse
quent lack of space in the ves
sels." Tho Beauty of Florida's Shore
Lines
People who have not made the
trip down the Gulf coast to Cuba
or up the Atlantic coast from Key
West have missed' an offering
from Mother Nature, for nowhere
in tho world do shorelines present
more varied beauties than those
of Florida. Those whose wealth
have allowed them to make this
close-in-to-shore trip in .their pri-
vate yachts are indeed fortunate,
and it is cause, for gratification
that, the lake-dotted country be
hind these shore lines presents
scenes that are. equally inspiring.
Whether one floats on the bos
om of the, restless Atlantic or the
less tempestuous Gulf, the scenes
presented in the light of a bene
diction-pronouncing sun or the
silvery rays of the moon arc suffi
cient to bring forth the cry, "The
heavens declare the glory of God,
and the firmament showeth His
handiwork." No master painter
or writer can adequately describe
the wonders of vHonda s shore
lines, which cast a magic spelj
upon all who are permitted t
voyage along them. In their
beauty we find one of many bless
ings, of which most of us take lit
tie or no consideration. Tampa

Trench Warfare, Having Failed
in His First Laid Plans for
Capturing Fortress.
London, England The German
assault on the defenses of Verdun
still is centered on the all-important
key position of Dead Man's
hill, west of the Meuse. Advanc
ing from Corbeaux wood, the Ger
mans gained a few elements of
French trenches. Otherwise tha
French war office announce, they
were beaten back with heavy
losses.
In the sector between Douau
mont and Vaux, which has rela
tively the same startegic import
ance east of the Meuse, the Ger
mans also renewed the attack.
There, the French report says,
they gained no success.
Paris regards the present ' at
tack of the Germans as their su
preme effort in this greatest of
battles. French commentators
suggest it may mark the close of
the Verdun campaign, whatever
the outcome. The general offen
sive launched on Sunday over a
thirteen-mile front is represented
as one of the heaviest blows
struck by the Germans in the war.
According to official French ad
vices the defenders of Verdun
have held firm except at , ono
point in the Dead Man's hill
neighborhood, where the Ger
mans gained 500 yards of French
trenches. It is . now reported,
from Paris that the main on-r,
slaught has diminished in extent
being limited to a front of about
two miles between Cumieres' and
Hill No. 304, west of the Meuse.
Berlin views the Verdun opera
tions confidently, pointing to tho
ground gained and the losses in
flicted on the French. The state
ment is made by the Overseas
News agency of Berlin that since
the beginning of the battle more
than 36,000 French have been
captured. It is also said that a
bout twenty-five square kilome
ters of ground has been occupied
west of the Meuse.
With the exception of the Ver-
dun sector no military operations
of significance are reported" from
any of the. battlefronts. The
change of seasons is interfering
with movements on the Russian,
Italian and Mesoptomanian front,
although on each' of these lines
there are signs of increasing ac
tivity, which is expected to be
come more pronounced as tho
spring advances.
All the passengers and crew of
the Spanish steamer Santanderi
no appracntly were rescued with
the exception of four persons,
who are believed to have been
drowned. The owners of .the
vessel have been notified she was
sunk by a submarine after fifteen '
minutes which had been allowed
for the departure of those on
board.
