The work at Silver Mines goe on
etnootbly bat rapidly and affairs there
aro developing- in a very promising
manner. The bijj boiler moved from
Jackson Revelle mine was gotten into
pluce this week and will b per
manently' installed within the next
few days. Other machinery has been
installed lately, notably a gasoline
hoisting apparatus which works rapid
ly and eaBily,
Thirty to fifty men are being need
and there' are reports -that a much
larger force will be put on in the near
future. We are informed that the
precious ore is being carried out of
tunnels and cut by hand and every
piece as large as a man's thumb is
carefully saved. Even the old dumps
of waste, thrown out mai:y years ago,
are carefully searched. i
Many rumor are in tne sir regard
ing further developement work.
Some claim that the dam will be
repaired and enlarged and that a ,
mill will be erected. Others claim
that a chemical, reduction plant will
soon appear. Probably all these re
ports are mere rumors, but the money
now-being spent and the preparations
being made would indicate that the
company is not merely prospecting.
This tungsten mine, one of the tew
in the United States, is attracting
much attention and giving the mining
possibilities of the county a great deal
of advertising.
Mr, JUdmonason. tne Miver Mine
Superintendent, has spent the past
eight or ten years mining In Mexico
and has many interesting things to
te.ll of Villa whom tie knew very
well. The bandit drove Mr. Edmond
son out of Mexico last October and
confiscated 600 kegs' of his powder.
Mr. Edmond9on says this powder Is
being used by Villa to-day.

Burk and Ilobtts in Politics.
United States Industrial Commission,
upon a supjeot of local and national
importance the ''eight-hotir" day"
demand of train and enginemen of
the United States:
What would such' a strike mean?
Conjecture at this time may be, idle,
but how long could this country stand
it? What would be the final outcome?
Arbitration of some kind, no doubt.!
Bat what, might happen meantime?
Would the railroad managers set tight
and wait results? That appears - to
be about the only thing they could do.
Would the government be com&elled
to act; seize the railroads' and at
tempt to operate them? Such a con
tingency is not impossible. Would
euoh a strike bring about compulsory
arbitration in this country, a thing
Which labor men strongly oppose?
The railroad brotherhoods- are op
posed to government ownership or
operation of railroads. Tbey realize
that under such a condition they could
not increase wages every year or two
; on a threat to Btrike. Governments
have a way of dealing with such de
mands. That has been shown in
France, in Italy, in South Africa, and
In other countries. Soldiers may not
; nnprate trains successfully, but they
have proved, effective in breaking
strikes. - ; r , - . , : .
" Tndnstrv "as now organized, how
ever, is flexible. It can readily adapt
itself to the most extraordinary air
Mimfltanceg. The European War 'has
demonstrated that fact. , The govern
ments have done things under the
cruise of "military necessity" which
would have caused a revolution in
time of Deace., A tie-up of our rail
roads might brine about a condition
of "military necessity" here. Presl
dent Roosevelt was prepared to seize
the anthracite coalmines in 1902 when
tii a mine owners consented to. ar-
toitrate. . ' v '..' f "
- The situation is,, fraught with the
gravest possibilities that the country
has had to efloounter In an Industrial
dispute. It is a situation which calls
" for clear thinking on the part of those
responsible. Itcalla for serious tho't
on the part of the publio, which in
the end will pay the cost, whatever It
.' may be. '. - , :-,
Political Pointers.
Notwithstanding the flaring head
lines that have appeared in the He
' publican . press to the contrary, the
State Board of Equalization most de
o dedly did not "refuse to equalize tax
valuations." What tbe"toard did, was
to refuse, to to increase the valuations
en Missouri farms Jo equal the valua
tion on St. Louis city property. . . ; s
Republican politicians are assuming
a great deal when they confidently
base their hopes of election this year
upon the expectation that Democrats
; of German parentage will vote; the
Republican ticket because they are
for tlie Kaiser and against President
Wilson. The political party that bases
its hopes upon sedition is itself a sedi
tious party. 1
To the Democrats of Missouri: ' '
'It is with extreme regret that I find
It necessary to defend Buchanan
. county Democracy- against tha con
siderate and insolent treatment, by
the Buchanan county delegation, of
the solendld reureaentatives of Mis
sourl Democracy In convention In this
cltv. .. ' , - ......
The citizens ot St. Joseph extended
a generous woloome to this great
Democratic gathering, and with ' a
"glad hand" of manly men give all
comers assurance of friendship and
self-constituted spokesmen led by
Judge C; H. Meyer, when represent
ing the minority report or tne resolu
tions com mittee in convention, active
ly aided by delegates R. E. Culver,
John Q. Parkipson, George W. Akers
and T. Jb. Uvsagbt. '
Buchanan county Democracy bows'
to majority rule and I challenge any
man's party fealty who seeks to nee a
minority privilege and make his local
personal - grievance a ' consideration
tor j insulting Missouri Democracy,
gathered in our city as invited guests.
1 nope that the uemocrats ot Mis
souri will be charitable , with St. Jo
seph's people in this extremity and
be guided by justice, and remember
always that St. Joseph bears wreaths
of hospitality from its splendid citizen-
Ship to every worthy citizen of Mis
souri, remembering that indiscretions
of a few on a publio occasion, are not
chargeable to tne community, except
ing, when persiaent recurring without
protest. 'V-. ;. ''
It is appropriate to say that the
Buchanan county, .delegation was
cheBen with the sole purpose of un
dertaking to do as Mr. Meyers tried
to do, and that the plan used to secure
the delegation was by getting proxies
from members of the county oommit
tee before-calling the committee to
gether, so that a majority vote income
mittee, secured for the purpose, ap
pointed delegates to acounty conven
tion that insured selection of delegates
to the State convention who would
carry on to the convention floor an
effort such as was undertaken, should
an opportunity be presented for it. .
Thus an unworthy arrangement ma
tured, which liaa no parallel in Mis
souri State conventions, for insult, to
the host ot able, intelligent Democrats
while guests of our city, which teems
with thousands of citizens extending
a chivalry that bespeaks gentility,and
Bpeakins for myself, will say that I
iad no connection directly or indir
ectly with the movement that culmin
ated in the effort referred to in the
convention, and I denounce the slimy
insult to the Missouri Democracy as
unworthy of true Democrats. '

Tho City dloaioii In Jackson yeater
day was a rebuke-to the methods em
ployed by the demagogic dry leaders.
Burk and Hobbs, two paid religious
clowns, burlesqued, religion for the
past ten days in the hope that their
antics would sway the voters.
Decent people believe in the church:
every one has a sincere respect for
1 the minister, regardless of his faith,
Tif he is a legitimate preacher, "But
men who call themselves clergymen,
who dance the buck and wing and
resort to curbstone slang in the pulpit
under the guise or religion, do tne
church no good. They bring it to
the level of the things they condemn,
Religion cannot be commercialized.
It must be conducted upon a high
and exalted plane. The priest cr
protestant minister Who is most rev
ered does not cavort for the edifica
tion of the curious or the amusement
of those who orave unique entertain
ment, tie fumiis ais duty to nis
church and those who worship in it.
That is religion, and it will always be,
Men like Burk and Hobbs -cannot
last. They , are simply the passing
show, and when they ar gone thejy
will be remembered as haviug been
here, but few will recollect what they
said. They are like the clowns in the
circus once in a long time they are
interesting, but when you become ac
customed to them, they are -bore-some.
'
Jast year Burk and Hobbs visited
JaekBO'n aiTa they influenced many
peoplei . But they only captured their
fees this year. The people voted just
the opposite of what they did one
year ago.
It is natural and right that people
differ on political questions. That .is
their privilege. Religious auctioneers
are not needed to adjust these dif-1
ferences, and, tbey cannot succeed.
This was demonstrated In .Jackson
yesterday.
Add now that it ii over, itwlll be
interesting to notice just how long
Burk , and Hobbs remain: in that
vicinity. If Jackson was a sin-ridden
city yesterday, it will be so next week;
and if Burk and Hobbs were needed
yesterday, they will be in demand one
week henee.y Their missionary expedi
tion no doubt ended, when the polls
cioseo, yet religion must pe neia re
sponsible for their show. . , .'
To grasp the pen to pay the last
tribute of respect to a loved one is a
task with a great sorrow. Mrs. -Robert
Lewis passed away at her home
near Sabuia, Mo., April 5, 1910. Age
about 85 years. .
Aunt Polly Lewis, aa she was famil
iarly called by all who knew her, after
a long and busy life died as she had
lived, honored and loved by all. The
end canje very Budden Wednesday
morning aoout 1 oxiock, unnoHb witu
the awakening ot, a new day. She
went to sleep like a tired child, eurely
a moBt fitting time fora pure spirit to
take its flifrht heavenward. With tne
eye of faith one could see at the dawn
ot this memorable day an invisible
hand wave a Bignal and a voice in
softest accents on the morning breeze
announce that the gates "were ajar,
and that God's angels, were waiting
to usher her into her eternal home.
Son8t daughters, fSitni'Mi,! weep , not
for the vacant chair which can never
be filled, but give yourselves comfort
for her soul is with God. Console
yourselves, for her troubles are o'er,
It is enough for us. to know her soul
is with its Makeiwhere she has joined
her companion and loved ones, and
with them beyond the dark River of
Death Bhe beckons you to come thro
the pearly gates where she waits to
meet you.
Her hours were filled with kind
words, her days with righteous deeds;
with a word of chees she greeted
you,and withwilling hands she help-

Cherished Torms who walked beside us
Down the long eventful years,
tlow we watohtd them as they van

Through a mist of. falling tears!
Loving voices hushed in silence,
Joining with the Angel band,
Singing, their triumphant anthems,
Over in the Bculub land. '
Hns'L then, eaoh rebellious murmur,
For we, too, are going home
Going t6 find our household treasures
When these tired feetcease to roam.
On the Resurrection morning,
Free from pain and free from care,
With our tear-dimmed' eyes made
perfect . . , . :,
We shall know each other there.

While walking on the streeta of
yonr town -last evening; I met Bro
J. Lutes. He invited me to attend the
revival meeting eolng on at the-M. E.
Uhurah. -1 gladly accepted the invita
turn. I wag tnere on time and tne
usher gave me a comfortable seat by
the furnace. I heard a fair sermon
by Kev. Velvick. His theme was the
rich man and his holdings. He bandied
the Subject One. I enjoyed it very
much. The prayer by Mrs. . Arthur
was very pathetic You know I would
rather hear a woman pray than a man;
they are so earnest i what they say.
God bless our women I What would
we do without them?
The solo by the pastor was simply
fine when he sang "Massa's In the
Cold, Cold Qi'bund" with sacred
words,. It reminded me of my boy
hood days back in the Southland. I
understand they had eighteen con
versions np to Sunday night? May
the Lord bless this meeting. Lutesville
is the busiest town I visit. The mer
chants are up-to-date and carry large
stocks of general merchandise. You
also have a first class hotel tho Cen
tral in every respect. I am always
glad to make your town for I enjoy

On sloping corn land Try plant
ing and cultivating across the slope
where possible in order to reduce soil
washing. When oorn is drilled with
the slope furrows are made which nre
sure to .increaso washing. While
checked corn is usually preferred by
the best farmers on land that Is not
subject to washing, it is usually more
important on rolling land to cultivate
n one direction only, and thJt around
the slope. The greatest damage is
done on steep slopes because tbo fast
er tho flow ol water the' greater the
amount of soil it will carry a way. If
you double the rate of flow of xwater,
it will more than double the amount
of soil removed. .
! A more perfect application of the
principle of planting across the slope
is found in contour farming, which
is mors fully explained in Circular 78
entitled The Control of Soil Washing,
reomitly issued by the Missouri Agri
cultural Experiment Station at Co-lninbia.-tM.
