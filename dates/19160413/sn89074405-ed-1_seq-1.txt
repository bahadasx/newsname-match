American citizens and that one of
them torpedoed a vessel In the. vi

FRENCH CLAIM
ALL SUCCESSES
Week's Attacks by Germans
Fail to Dislodge
Them.
Paris, April 19.—The attack on Ver
dun has subsided for the moment, aft
er several days of particularly severe
fighting. There were no engagements
of importance in that region last
night, the official French statement of
this afternoon says.
Preparations toere made by the
Germans for an attack on Hill 304, an
Important strategic point commanding
a large section of territory west of
the Meuse, but the Paris communica
tion says the French prevented the
execution of this plan.
The principal German effort since
the general Verdun offensive was be
gun Sunday has been to attempt to
force a passage between Dead Man's
Hill and Cumierres for the purpose of
enveloping the hill. Some French
trenches In this vicinity were carried,
but the main positions of the defend
ers were held, Paris regards the op
erations of the week as having result
ed decidedly to the advantage of the
French.
Following the evacuation of Bethin
court salient, the Germans were com
pelled to make frontal attacks, except
at Dead Man's Hill, where they at
tempted to advanoe through ravines.

Members of the league declare that
compulsory military service is-neces

troops pledged to England.
The league has prepared .figures
showing that since the beginning of

Numerous methods of recruiting

a house-to-house poll, in an effort to

conclusion that the advisable course
to be taken for solution of the ques

One of the most Interesting plays
from many standpoints ever presented
here will be the performance of
Shakespeare's "Much Ado About
Nothing" at the Metropolitan theater
next Tuesday evening. The play Is
being staged In the Blisabethean man
ner by the Seek'and Buskin society
under the auspleai of the senior class
of university.

seen In this- pta^ Mr marked advant
age. ^he larger^ pictures are drawn
with sweeping strokes and plenty of
color, and the miniatures sire sketched
with the utmost ears and attention to
detail.
One of the striking characters in
the play is that of Leonato, the genial
Old man. whose kindly hospitality, big
heartedness and boyish love of fun
endear him to all who know him.
This role is being most adequately
played by Ben Sherman, one of the
strongest actors In the society. Mr.
Sherman has won his reputation prin
cipally for his splendid work In com
edy parts. But in his present piece
of work Mr. Sherman is. demonstrat
ing his ability to do serious things
as well. His versatility has been
developed ^during the past two years
under the tutelage or Miss Nella
Kingsbury of the Wesley college de
partment of expression.
Another old man Is the brother of
Leonato, Antonio. This character Is
being produced by Porter Talcott, one
of the best players of ecoentrlc char
acters in the society. So- true and so
vital are Mr. Talcott's portrayals that
he has been cast for two parts In the
present play. He will play also the
comedy part of Verges, the companion
of this pompous Dogberry. The con
trast between these two characters It
marked 'and Mr. Talcott's skill In
creating the two. In the same perform
ance is admirable.
The cast has been working hard for
the patt four weeks, and during the
past week full rehearsals have been
held every evening.

Note Sent to Arredondo, Carranza's Representative at
Washington, For Delivery to Lansing—
Occasioned no Great Surprise.
Washington, April 13.—General Carranza, in a
note which arrived at his embassy here for presenta
tion to Secretary Lansing, asks for the withdrawal of
the American troops from Mexico. Elisco Arredondo,
Carranza's ambassador, presented the note to the state
department. It raises a new issue in a situation al
ready much complexed, the outcome of which officials
are reticent to predict, until they have gone over the
situation carefully and considered what reply the Unit
ed States will make. In official quarters it is stated
that American troops will not be withdrawn, at t$jtfs
time at least, and that while the question is being
cussed with Carranza, the pursuit of the Villa
will be rushed with renewed vigor.

-Sle tocomment oponCarranzas note,
question^ of administration
in the jurisdictaoft of tlie president and sHi?
ment. Although Carranza raised the side
administratioh'^Fidals at their first view of the coi
munication regarded the principal contention^
that the object of the punitive expedition
complished so far as it can be and that the
have been dispersed..
NO BVIDHWCE OP DTSPEHSAIU
Hh ww depajrtment officjels. take the view that they hat-e
«WwKf that the Villa beads have been dispersed, because they never
had definite Information of their number and that the very nature of
the dtutbm gives no evidence that the raiders have been extermin
ated. Some state department officials confessed that Carrsnxa'O note
was not a surprise..
Counselor Polk, confirmed.the statement in a note that when he
asked fen: the use-of Mexican railways, the reply "was satisfactory,"
hut was coupled with sn expression of surprise that the United States
bad not awaited final approval of the pending protocol before sending
troops across the border.
NO FORMAIi PROTEST MADE.
It is declared officially, however, that no formal protest against the
entry of Pershing's columns had been previously made by General Gar
ntniA.
When the advanoe troops crossed at Columbus, it was officially
stated that a Carranza general me* them at the border and made no
protest either personally or on behalf of his government.
State department officials took the view that Oerransa's note is
not a demand for the Immediate withdrawal of the forces, but an Invi
tation to begin negotiations to limit their stay.
Counselor Polk conferred with Major General Scott, chief of staff,
and announced that the negotiations would be handled exchMdrely by
Secretary Xnnalng.
AMERICANS AND MEXICANS CLASH.
San Antonio, Tex., April 1*.—Advices received at depai Us mil

have had an enooonter with either the Mexican military authoritlsa or
the civilian population of Psrrall. No details are available. The re
port came to General Punston from American Consul Iietcher. It
stated that Major Gutierrez, commander at Parral, said there was a
clash, which he termed unimportant, between the American forces
and troops or the garrison or residents of Parral.
The Americans entered the town with the intention of marching
through, enroute southward. An exchange of shots followed. Ihc In
ference Is that the Americans continued to march through the
town. They probably were the troops under Major Tompkins Girttw
