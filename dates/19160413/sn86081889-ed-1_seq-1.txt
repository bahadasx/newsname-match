Mrs. Marshall Logu e.
This community was startled
hy the information that Mary
Koplin Logue, widow of John
Marshall Log je, had died sudden
ly at her home in Philadelphia
last Saturday morning. Since
the death of her husband on the
second day of last January, Mrs.
Logue and her mother, Mrs. W.
0. Koplin had been residing in
Philadelphia. Mrs. Logue was
aged about 28 years, and appa

Saturday morning she and her
mother were in the same room
engaged in the usual morning
housekeeping duties, when sud
denly Mrs. Logue exclaimed, "0
mother! I have such a pain in
ny chest," and almost at the
jame instant, dropped to the floor
at her mother's feet lifeless.
Her mother-in-law, Mrs. B. W.
Logue, and her sister-in-law,

CULA RITCHIE DOME.
Had Been in the Chambersburg Hospi
tal Since the Thirteenth Day of
Last December.
Cula Ritchie, fifteen-year-old
daughter of Simon Ritchie, re
turned to her home near Burnt
Cabins on Tuesday of last week,
after having spent fifteen weeks
in the Chambersburg hospital.
Early on the morning of the
13th of last December, Cula'a fa
ther was in the kitchen at their
home examining a shotgun pre
paratory to going deer hunting
when, without warning the gun
"went ofE" and the charge shat
tered the right leg of his daugh
ter who was standing near. Dr.
Mosser of McConnellsburg was
at once notified and he, ia turn,
summoned Doctors Palmer and
Skinner from the Chambersburg
hospital, who responded with
amazing promptness and thus
prevented the girl's bleeding to
death. The surgeons had Cula
taken to the hospital at once,
where they amputated the injur
ed limb above the knee, and the
girl being in splendid physical
condition, withstood the ordeal
without any ill effects, and the
wound healed rapidly.
While she i3 obliged to use
crutches, she ia cheerful and opti
mistic, and realizes that it might
have been a great deal worse.
Recent Weddirgs.
Mason Hamill.
Mr. Jere Mason, of Hancock,
Md., and ex-sheriff of Fulton
county, Pa., was married in Hag
erstown on Thursday of last week
to Mrs. Jennie H;;mill, of Fort
Loudon. The ceremony was per
formed by the Rev. J. Spangler
Kieffer, of Zion's Reformed
church. Mrs. Hamill is a daugh
ter of the late Judge Peer Gor
don, widow of Alexander Hamil,
and mother of Harry Hamill, of
the City Hotel. Mr. and Mrs.
Mason have the hearty wishes of
their numerous Fulton County
friends.
Morton Smith.
George Patterson Morton, son
of Judge and Mrs. Peter Morton,
near McConnellsburg, was mar
ried in Chambersburg last Satur
day to Miss Laura V. Smith,
daughter of Mr. Frank Smith,
near Big Cove Tannery. The
ceremony was performed by the
Rev. J. Crayton Nicholas, pastor
of the First Lutheran church of
that city. The bride possesses
not only the charm of person,
but a beauty of 'character that
will make a helpmeet indeed to
the one to whom she has pledged
her love and fidelity. The groom
is a graduate of the McConnells
burg High School, a graduate of
Northwestern College, Omaha,
Nebr., and a graduate of the
Pennsylvania State College Ag
ricultural course. George and
his bride are taking charge of
the Cold Spring farm just east
of town, and they have the best
wishes of their numerous friends
for health, prosperity, and' com
munity usefulness.
Karris fo; Congress.
As may be noted elsewhere in
this paper, George A. Harris an
nounces his candidacy for Con
gress. As he has no opposition,
he will have everything his own
way at the primaries. Ten, when
it comes down to the final round
up next November, there will be
no need of any salve for party
sores, and Fulton County will
have a splendid chance to give
one of favorite sons an uphols
tered chair in the hall of the pop
ular branch of the United States
Congress. George needs no
boosting in Fu'ton County. Nine
years in the office of prothono
tary, and succeeding years as the
head of one of our banks, make
him personally and favorably
known to every citizen in the
County, who will take pleasure
in giving him a boost that will be
, most flattering indeed.
The Evangelistic Meetings.
As was told in the News last
week, Evangelist Sieber arrived
in town Wednesday evening and
took charge of the services which
had been in progress since the
preceding Sunday evening. Not
withstanding the inclement weath
er last week, the house was fill
ed, and since the weather has
cleared up, there is hardly room
for the large number of persons
who attend from night to night
with increased interest. Dr. Sie
ber is no sensationalist, performs
no acrobatic stunts, but he tells
the "Old Old Story" in that plain
convincing way that leads his
hearers to think and act for
themselves. The meeting will
close with that next Sunday
evening, and the topics for the
remaining services will be as
follows:
Thursday evening Incidents
from Gettysburg Battlefield.
Friday evening Eternity; and
where we spend it.
Saturday evening The Last
Chance.
Sunday: 10:30, God's Keeping
Grace. 2:30 n;en only) "Shoot
ing" the Court. 7:30 The Great
Promotion and Farewell.
It is only when we attend up
on such services as these that
we realize what we miss when
we wilfully ignore them and pur
posely stay away. Let us not
forget that this is God's work;
that the message i3 a direct mes
sage from God through his ser
vants to each individual person
in this town or surrounding neigh
borhood, Christ's own words in
St John 5:24 are, He that hear
eth my word and believeth on
him that sent me, hath everlast
ing life, and shall not come into
condemnation. Also, in St. John
5:40, he says, And ye will not
come to me that ye might have
life.
McConnellsburg Boy Honored.
With the installation of their
new big fire-fighting apparatus
in Carlisle, Clarence Conrad, son
of Mr. and Mrs. J. J. Conrad,
formerly of the Cove, was select
ed as driver of the big machine.
That Clarence stands in with the
boys composing the Friendship
Fire Company, the Carlisle Her
ald says, the boys served a ban
quet Monday night. The func
tion was a surprise to Chauffeur
Conrad. About thirty were
present. The menu including
ham sandwiches, cheese, pickles,
olives, chila sauce, celery, or
anges, cheese wafers, ice cream,
cake, ' coffee and cigars. Imagine
Driver Conrad's surprise when
after being called away by Mr.
Fierro, the Ahrens-Fox engine
demonstrator he found prettily
decorated tables laden with
things good to eat There were
speeches by most of those pres
ent. President Lackey delivered
a fine address of welcome. Col
onel George Hoffman gave a his
tory of the Friendship and Mr.
Conrad and Mr. Fierro made ap
propriate remarks.
Hesses Mill Changes Hands.
The Hess Mill Property i n
Thompson township, for several
years owned and operated by
Dennis Everts, was sold last
week to James Gordon, a son of
David Gordon of Thompson town
ship. James a few days age
took unto himself a wife in the
person of Miss Mary Souders, a
daughter of the late Mr. and Mrs
Otho Souders, of Todd township.
This Mili site is one of the oldest
and best water power sites in the
County, and the mill is equipped
with rolls. James is something
of a genius in handling and tak
ing care of machinery, and there
is no reason why he should ever
be "sorry of his bargain."
For using a "turkey call" while
hunting last fall, Jnhn D. Titzle,
of near Germantown, Pa., was
fined $50 last Saturday by a New
Germantown justice of the peace.
H. C. Showaker, of the same
place, was fined $25 for shipping
a wild turkey outside of the
state.

Concerning the concrete silo of
which I wrote in my last commu
nication to the News, I wish to
say now that any one who has
one is to be congratulated; but I
would not advise building one for
the reason that the cost is just
about twice that of a wood stave
silo, and then there is danger of
the silage freezing.

The Bible.
This book contains : The mind
of God, the state of man, the
way of Salvation, doom of sinners
and happiness of believers. Its
doctrines are holy, its precepts
are binding, its histories are true,
and its decisions are innumerable.
Read it to be wise, believe it to
be safe, and practice it to be holy.
It contains light to direct you. It
is the traveler's map, the pil
grim's staff, the pilot's compass,
the soldier's sword, and the
Christian's character. Here
Heaven is opened, and the gates
of Hell disclosed. Christ is its
Grand Subject, our good, its de
sign, and the glory of God its
end. It should fill the memory,
rule the heart, and guide the
feet. Read it slowly, frequently,
prayerfully. It is a mine of
wealth, a paradise of glory, and
a river of pleasure. It is given
you in life, and will be open at
the Judgment, and be remem
bered for ever. It rewards the
greatest labor, and condemns all
who trifle with its holy contents.

It Was Loaded.
At the home of his brother-in-law
Samuel Helman in Dublin
township last Saturday afternoon
George Cooper aged 18, was ex
amining a revolver, when the
weapon was discharged, and the
bullet went crashing into one of
his logs just below the knee. On
Monday he was taken to the
Chambersburg hospital, and it
was thought for a timo that his
leg would have to be amputated
above the knee; but it is believed
now that his leg can be saved,
but be is likely to have a stiff
knee the remainder of his life.

DISEASE LLRKS IN MATTRESS.
Campaign Instituted by the State Au
thorities to Enforce the Pore Mat
tress Law.
Harrisburg, Pa., April 9, .:
Thousands of mattresses, offered
for sale in various sections of
Pennsylvania, have been con
demned by inspectors of the De
partment of Labor and Industry
in the campaign instituted by
Commissioner John Price Jack
son to enforce the "pure mattress
law" passed by the legislature.
Prosecutions for flagrant viola
tions have been instituted and
fines have been imposed.
The inspection of mattresses,
offered for sale, has been con
ducted under the direct supervi
sion of Dr. Francis D. Patterson,
Chief of the Division of Hygiene
and Engineering of the Labor
Department.
In the Pittsburgh district alone
31), 514 mattresses, offered for
sale in violation of the Act, were
discovered. Of these mattresses
25,000 were not properly tagged,
13,168 contained material prohib
ited by law and 134G were second
hand mattresses.
Inspectors of the Department
have discovered that the tremen
dous demand for cotton and sim
ilar material in the manufacture
of ammunition for the European
war has caused a dearth of ' ma
terial suitable for filling mattres
ses of the cheaper grades. Some
manufacturers claim that this
lack of material has been respon
sible for many of the violations
of the law.
It has also been found that
many mattresses, not conform
ing to the Pennsylvania Law, are
being shipped into Pennsylvania
from factories in adjoining states
Several car loads of mattresses
have been condemned before they
were unloaded.
Mattresses must be manufac
tured of approved material thor
oughly sterilized and disinfected.
A secondhand mattress may not
be sold unless it has been steril
ized by an approved method and
a mattress that has been used by
a person having any contagious
or infectious disease may not be
resold under any conditions. Ev
ery mattress offered for sale
must have securely sewed to its
cover, a linen or muslin tag not
less than 3x4 i inches in size and
bearing the name of the manu
facturer and vendor as well as a
complete description of the con
tents of the mattress. Shoddy
may not be used in any mattress.
The campaign to enforce the
"pure-mattress law" is being
waged in all sections of the State
and will be continuous to prevent
the spread of contagious or in
fectious diseases by the sale of
contaminated mattresses.

TOBACCO.
Little Talks on Health and Iljgiene by
Samuel G. Dixon, M. D., LL. D.,
Commissioner of Health.
The spirit which hovered about
the red man's council fires fbit
ing upward m the smoke of the
peace pipe, seems to have charm
ed all mankind. The use of to
bacco, in one form or another, in
three centuries and a half, ha3
become world wide.
Despite the almost universf.1
indulgence and the praises that
have been sung of the soothing
effect of tobacco, science con
demns it, and offers an irrposing
array of experiments to prove
the ill effects which follow it3
use.
Tobacco is a drug which con
tains powerful poisons. Its
charm lies in its drug effects. If
it has any beneficial effects they
are not discoverable to the scien
tific investigator. On the other
hand, there are certain decided
results tending to physical de
terioration, which are readily
recognizable. It is a heart de
pressant, and experiments on
animals have shown that it has
a tendency to produce hardening
of the arteries. Some of the
foremost authorities have made
clinical observations which indi
cate that the use of tobacco ha3
similar effects on man.
As is generally the case in the
use of drugs, there is a tendency
to increasing indulgence. Those
who have had experience in ath
letics are familiar with the fact
that the use of tobacco results ia
interference with the breathing
by depressing the heart action.
There are other affections com
mon to smokers.
To make a summary in brief
the results of all scientific Inves
tigations seem to prove conclu
sively that the use of tobacco i3
distinctly harmful to the majori
ty of men.
The County Agent Again.
A highly intelligent farmer
asked me but to-day "Ought we
not to have a County Agent?"
"There is nothing," I naade re
ply that we need worse unless it
be good local roads. President
Wilson's policy was to reduce the
price of living to our people. He
has failed, because supply and
demand regulate the price of liv
ing, as it does everything else.
Should the price of living be re
duced? Undoubtedly; but not
by strangling any industry for
the good of man, but by so fos
tering agriculture that men will
turn to it from choice rather than
as a last resort.
When transportation facilities
are provided, when farm credits
are available at lower rates, when
the state controls distribution,
when the public schools properly
understand the teaching of agri
culture, when each county has one
or more County Agricultural
Agents, then may the President
realize his dream.
Then, will intelligence solve
the problem for him. Then will
the country church flourish and
of old; then will the birth rate
exceed the death rate, then will
crime and immorality diminish;
then will prohibition become more
than a dream and the problem of
the great cities cease to trou
ble for, then conditions wi 1 1
exualize themselves automatically
Let us have the County Agent
at any rate. M. S. McDowell of
State College in a late letter to
your correspondent, promises us
an agent by another year, but
we must show some desire for
bettering our own condition.
Keep up the agitation.
W. C. Patterson.
Mr. W. D. Myers, accompanied
by Dr. I. H. Tobias, went to Bal
timore Tuesday, where the form
er's youngest son, Howard, un
derwent an operation at the
Maryland University Hospital,
the result of which we hope will
be the means of speedily restor
ing the little fellow to perfect
health. Hancock News.
