No less than seventy cases are
awaiting adjudication at the spring
term ot circuit court, which is sched
uled to convene at 9 o'clock nexc
Monday morning, and as many ara
of an important nature the session
promises to be a long one and win
probably occupy the full three
weeks to which it is limited by thj
provisions of the code. Another in
teresting feature "will be the first
local appearance of Hon. Guy
Rencher as prosecuting attorney.
Mr. Rencher was nominated last
August, but did not enter upon the
discharge of his duties until Jan
uary, and although he has prosecut
ed one case in a magistrate's court
in this county he has never before
appeared in his official capacity at
local term of circuit court. Tho
impending session will be presided
over by Hon. T. B. Carroll, Judge of
the Sixteenth circuit court district.
A case docketed for trial which
will incite widespread interest is
that in which Mr. J. A. Strickland
seeks to obtain a verdict against the
Credit Division of the local Cham
ber of Commerce for damages in
the sum of $5,000. Some time ago
Mr. Strickland filed a bill complain
ing that Mr. C. B. Lovell, through
the influence and at the suggestion
of the defendant organization, sent
him letters having a tendency to
impair not only his financial credit
but his general standing as a citizen,
and asking to be awarded damages
in the above stated amount. The
plaintiff is represented by Hon. R.
M. Holmes, while Hon. E. E. Calla
way of the firm of Callaway and
Storey is the attorney of record for
the defendant organization.
'the most important case on the
criminal docket is that of the state
vs. John Odum on the charge of
murder. Mr. Odum killed Mr. C. M.
Lollar near Caledonia several
months ago, and though granted
bail in the sum of $5,000 made bo
effort to secure bondsmen, and ban
remained in jail ever since the hear
ing took place. The State will be
represented by District Attorney
Rencher, and, so far as could bo
lta,ned, Mr. Odum has not retained
counsel.
