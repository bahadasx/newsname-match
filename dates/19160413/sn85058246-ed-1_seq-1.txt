I
Has a Wonderful Opportunity In the
Famous Players Production,
"Nearly a King"
"Nearly a King, which was written
- especially for John Bnrrymoro, gives
this celebrated coniedllan the greatest
opportunity of the motion picture
career to display the thousand and
ono comic sides of his talented nit
ture which have made him a prlino
favorite sinco his introduction to the
film world by the Famous Players
Film Company. This Paramount
Picture which will bo the attraction
at tho Lyric Theater tonight,
never pauses In interest from tho
moment it opens until tho final
scene.
It is tho talo of a young American
who has the great fortune or mlsfor
tuno to resemblo tho Prince of Bui
wana, an adventurous spirit who is
just In tho throes of being palme'd off
on a princess whom ho has never
seen. But tho prince loves nn nctross
and determines that ho is going to
marry her despito reasons of stato
which render it expedient that ho ev
pouso tho Princess of Okam.
Tho negent of Okam has summon
ed Heleno, tho princess, back to the
Balkans from America, whore she is
in school. On tho steamer she ha
met n happy go lucky sort of young
American who came sliding Into her
stato room during tho mlddlo of tho
night on his Bteamer trunk, which
was being lashed about his stateroom
uy tho rolling of tho ship and finally
went on a wild junket extremely un

No sooner docs Jack land In Lon

W meal pigs feet bought from a
street peddlar, Jack finds himself
I laco to face with Helene, who is in
search of a cab. Speed and accuracy
I of hat Juggling save him from recog

I Meanwhile the prince has corao to
I London to marry his actress In so
I cret, and a spy, learning of his lnten-
tlon, drugs him. He takes refugo in
I Jack's cab, and when ho revives
sends Jack to the trystlng place with
I a note. Tho princess has been tak
I en to the houso whero tho prlnco Is

I Seized nnd blindfolded, he is forced

SEVENTH DAY
ADVENTIST GIVES
ANOTHER TALK
Many persons talk of the cleansing
power of tho blood of Jesus Christ,
but llud It Impossible to explain how
It can bo applied, said Evangelist M.
A. Holllstcr In speaking of tho torn
plo service ns Instituted by tho Lord
Jesus Christ In tho wilderness and
oven farther back than that, for
according to Gen. 4:4, Ablo the son
of Adam understood tho sacrificial
system.
This system was Just a comptvetod
prophecy of tho gospel as revealed
by tho sncrlflco of Christ, upon cal
vary when this work was only' jUBt
begun. In Hebrews 8:1-5 wo read
that Christ Is our high priest, and
that, even were he upon earth ho
would not bo a priest, becauso the
priesthood law would prevent It and
farther, chapter 7:11-17 shows that
tho priesthood and lnw wero chang
ed In order that ho might bo a priest
In heaven nnd earth.
PrlestH upon earth had to belong
to tho Tribe of Levi, nnd a high
priest bo a descendant of Aaron as
well, but when Christ came that was
changed nnd ho became a priest af
ter the Melchlscdlc order, because of
tho power of an endless life, there
foro any priest of this order must
have a never ending life, nnd havo
no fnther, mother or beginning of
days, etc., Hcb. 7:1-10.
Tho tcmplo service endpd nt tho
cross ,so far ai priests on this earth
was concerned for the veil was rent
in twain at that tlmo, Matt. 27:50-51,
to show that Its sacrcdness had ceas
ed, and was transferred to heaven,
Heh. 9:24-20.
Rome has tried for years to main
tain a system of sacrificial service,
a priesthood etc., said tho speaker,
but tho Lord has plainly pointed out
that any system of that kind was
falso for 2 Thos, 2:3-1 Bald that wo
wcro to bo careful lest any man de
ceive us In 'this matter.
Tho present nnd future work of
Christ Is to be continued In the sub
jects for tho rest of tho week nnd
Mr. Holllstcr gnvo an urgent Invita
tion to all to study these subjects
so as to know tho truth for them
selves. (Communicated.)

LORIMER DEFENSE BEGIN.S
Chicago, April 10. Taking of the
testimony for tho defonso began to
day in tho trial of William Lorimor
charged with conspiracy In connec
tion with tho failure of tho LaSnllo
Street Trust & Savings Bank. Judge
Dover overruled all savo two motions
to dismiss nlno counts of the Indict
ment and two not overruled woro
taken under advisement,
GEO. ROMNEY
AMONG THOSE
SLATH TO GO
Not many people In Cacho county
know It, but nevertheless It Is a fai't.
that tho Cacho county delegation to
tho stato Democratic Convention had
sonio time at Salt Lako City. Now
that time enough has elapsed to per
mit those Who wero sweating to cool
off, those who were hot under tlio
collar to tamo down, and those who
wero ovorjqyed to rojolco In full
measure, It may bo well to let tho
peoplo of tho county on to sonio of
tho doings of this delcctnblo bunch.
It will hnvo been observed In advance
that tho delegation was what might
bo termed antl-lllalr, tho victory that
tho Postmaster scored recently still
w rankling in tho hearts of Chalrmin
Romnoy and his followers, so that
tho first thing tho delegation pro
ceeded to do was to get tho scalp
of tho Hon. William Wallace This
fact was accomplished In masterful
style, nnd James II. Moylo was so
overwhelmingly elected ocr Mr.
Wallace, that Mr. Moylo will do well
to carry off tho honors without be
coming somewhat conceited himself
This was a great triumph nnd did
much to smooth tho wounded feeling
of tho victims In tho recent Logan
post ofllco controNcrsy but at the
samo tlmo It wns very depressing to
tho postmaster nnd his followers.
Now It will be remembered that
tho convention had much to say on
prohibition, and while tho Cacho rtoly.
gatlon was celebrating this wonder
ful victory over Mr Wallace, In
purely Salt Lnko style, they camo up
against somo very serious disagree
ments on tho prohibition question,
nnd It Is stated without reservation
that tho attltudo of their leader,
Chairman Romnoy, wna so opposed to
tho attltudo of a majority of tho del
egation that steps will bo taken to
havo tho Chairman removed. Of
course no ono oxpects him to bo ro
moved, but It may not bo long until
somo good friend will provnll upon
tho Smlthfleld leader to hand In hU
resignation nnd It will bo done Or
If tho big fellow from our neighbor
ing town on tho north becomes oil
stlnnto, It Is not unlikely that boiho
ono of tho faithful from Salt Lu'co
will run up to Cacho nnd do tho thing
up diplomatically. At any rate tha
untcrrlfled nro In n muddle, and It
looks as though tho chairman Is slat
ed to go. And thus a great victory
for tho Blair forces will bo Bcorcd.
