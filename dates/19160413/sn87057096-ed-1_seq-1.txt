THE PRIMARY ELECTION
Bitllttle Interest was Taken in the
Primary Election. A Small
Vote all Over the State.
The presidential preferential pri
mary election held in Idwa on last
Monday was a decided farce, it be
ing estimated that only about 90,000
votes were cast in the entire state. In
Decatur county but very little inter
est was taken, about 900 votes being
cast in the whole county, less than
the total number in Leon and Lamo
ni alone. There was really not much
to interest anyone in voting. The
contest for selection of national com
mitteeman on the republican ticket
was between John T. Adams and
John Olson and Adams.won out by
about five to two and tile democratic
contest for national committeeman
between Wilbur W. Marsh and Ed
Dunn was won by Marsh with a vote
of about three to two.
On the republican district delegate
ticket there was a three cornered
contest, the conference nominees be
ing J. R. Bowsher of Leon, and H. E.
Tomlinson, of New Market, while M.
L. Temple, of Osceola, appeared as
a standpat candidate at the last
minute. The unofficial returns for the
district shows that Bowsher and
and Tomlinson were elected by the
following vote in the entire district,
Bowsher 3,044, Tomlinson 3,022,
Temple 2,435.
The vote ty^counties was as fol

If the voters of the state had their
way about it there would never be
another presidential preferential pri
mary election held in Iowa. It is
estimated that it cost the state in the
neighborhood of $200,U00 to hold
the primary Monday, and it was a
foregone concision that the delegates
from Iowa to the republican national
convention would be for Cummins,
and those to the democratic national
convention would be for Wilson.
Democratic Conference at Des Moines
Saturday.
To the Democrats of lowat
A general conference of all the
democrats of the state is hereby call
ed, to be held in Des Moines, on Sat
urday, April 15th, at 1 p. m. at the
Savery hotel.
Tliif? conference is for the purpose
of considering and discussing candi
dates for governor and for othei- state
offices. Also other matters of gen
eral interest to the party will be dis
cussed and considered at this time.
This conference is deemed neces
sary on account of the short time be
tween this date and the date on
which nomination papers of candi
dates for state offices must be filed
with the secretary of state.
It is imperative that we have can
didates in the first place for every
such office, and that their nomination
payers be circulated and filed in or
?er that there may be no vacancies on
our ticket.
Every democrat in Iowa who is in
terested in the welfare of the party
is invited and urged to be present to
take part in this conference.
J. W. Reynolds, Chairman.
Received State Auto Tax Money.
County treasurer Elba Shewmaker
on Tuesday received Decatur county's
semi-annual apportionment of the
state automobile registration tax, the
amount being •11,248. This is a
big increase over last year, when the
spring apportionment amounted to
?6,752, the fall apportionment being
$4,320, making a total for the year
of $11,072, so it Mil be seen that the
first apportionment for this year ex
ceeds the total for last year. The
total amount distributed to the coun
ties,this week, was $1,157,138, being
on the basis of $703 for each town
ship. Kossuth and Pottawattamie
counties, each of which ha's 28 town
ships, receive the greatest sums,
$19,684, and Plymouth and Wood
bury counties which have 2'4 town
ships receive $16,872 each.

OSCEOLA EDITOR A SUICIDE.
Gerald Douthett, Editor of the Dem
ocrat, Shot Himself Last Friday.
Gerald Douthett, who purchased
the Osceola Democrat and became the
editor of the paper last October, com
mitted suicide by shooting himself in
the temple with a small calibre rifle
last Friday atternoon. Douthett had
been troubled with insomnia, and
when a member of the family went
into a small shed at the home of his
father, Dr. D. K. Douthett, they
found the young man lying in one
corner of the shed with the blood
streaming from the wound. He was
22 years of age and unmarried. Mr.
Douthett was a bright young man,
enjoying a prosperous business, but
was considered somewhat erratic.
Will Put Davis City on The Map.
F. M. Freeman, of Davis City, re
ceived a patent on a combined fire
and fireiess sanitary chicken brood
er in March of this year, and he is
f.oing to put the name of Davis City
on the map among chicken breeders
all over the county. We this week
were privileged to see one of the
new brooders and it is entirely dif
ferent from anything in this line
which has heretofore been on the
market. It is the product of the in
genuity of Mr. Freeman, and lie
worked on a model a long time be
fore perfecting it. Now that he has
secured a patent he is manufacturing
them as fast as limited working cap
acity will allow and has sold a num
ber and all who have used them say
they are the best tiing in the way of
a brooder they ever saw. The heat
ing aparatus is entirely safe and is
automatically controlled by a thermo
stat. Mr. Freeman has bought
ground for a factory' which will be
erected for the manufacture of these
brooders, and will install labor sav
ing machinery which will do away
with much hand work which is now
required in making them. "Shin
nick" is a prince of a good fellow
and everybody who knows him will
want to see him make a barrel of
money out of the enterprise.
Appointed a New City Marshal.
At the regular meeting of the city
council last Thursday evening Mayor
Gardner presented the name of Mar

marshal, and the council approved of
his appointment. Marshal Osborn

AT THE TABERNACLE
Meetings Still Gfting and Growing.
400 Converts. 600 in Sunday
School Street Parade.
The evangelistic meetings at the
tabernacle are now in the fifth and
what is probably the final week of
the campaign, and it promises to be
the most fruitful of all. The "Har
per combination" is relentless and
untiring in its intensity and entausi
asm. Nothing discourages or side
tracks them. The past week was full
of activity and achievement.
Two new men were brought here
to help in the work. On Thursday
and Friday evenings, Rev. Frank A.
Gageby of Washington, Iowa, was the
speaker, and he proved to be a speak-'
er of unsual ability. He was not in-j
troduced as a minister and he pitcli-j
ed into liis sermon in an unconven
tional way, but it was so.on evident
that he was a speaker of more than
ordinary experience, and that he' had
a great message. His subject waai,
"The White Ticket," and by his rap-:
il flow of words and sledge hammer
blows of truth, he jarred the audi
ence into profound admiration and
deep meditation. Several came for
ward when the invitation was given
The snow and slush lfcept many awaj
from the tabernacle Friday evening
yet a good sized crowd was present
to hear Mr. Gageby's sermon, "Tht
Field of Blood."
Saturday night the speaker waS
Mr. Eugene Palmer of Cedar Rapids|
Seven years ago Mr. Palmer was
prize fighter and a gambler, but wag
converted in a Billy bunday meeting
at Ottumwa and is now secretary of
the Young Men'& Christian Associa
tion at Cedar Rapids. Mr. Palmer
speaks with.a fervor and (solicitude
that claims the attention of his hear
ers, and he gets results, either by one
method or another. At the men's
meeting Sunday afternoon Mr. Palm
er told of his rescue from the under
world. His story made a deep im
pression upon the men. In the even-|
ing the tabernacle "was crowded to
the doors, many had to stand and.
others did not get in at all. Mr.
Palmer preached and twenty or more,
hit the "saw dust" trail. Mr. Harper,
after having rested a few days from
preaching came back strong with a
good sermon Sunday morning. He
also spoke at the women's meeting in
the afternoon at the Methodist
church and at the young people's
meeting in the evening. Mr. B. W.
Garrett of Des Moines, clerk of the
Iowp State Supreme Court, was at
the services Sunday and led in pray
er a', the men's me-ting. Mr.
rett has been a speaker in the Harper
meetings at other pla«es and at the
men's meeting he spoke in the high
est praise of the work of Mr. Harper
and his men in other parts of the
state. Up to Sunday evening there
were 400 conversions in the meet
ings and 54
re-consecrations.
Wednesday evening was Sunday
school night and it was the most
demonstrative service of all. The
different Sunday schools assembled at
their respective churches at 7 o'clock
and marched to the public square,
where they all formed in line and
marched around the square and to
the -tabernacle. The line extended
almost entirely around the square,
and would have formed more than a
wall around the square had they been
marching two abreast. There were
more than six hundred in the parade.
The business-professional men had a'
good line up Tuesday evening. The
music of the services is fine. The
"Big Swede" is always there in all of
his glory with a splendid solo or a
great chorus, choir. Mr. Smith and
the male quartet have greatly plea3
ed the audience with their singing,
The audience has greatly enjoyed the
singing of Mr. O. Cheek of Columbus,
Ohio, an evangelistic singer and
worker of great power. Mr. Cheek
has just ciosed a meeting at Eddy
ville, Iowa, and came to visit at
Leon and be in the'meetings.
The services this evening promises
to be a great meeting. It is "sausage
night." The man, who is the big
gest sausage maker in the United
States is to speak. He is certain to
have a big crowd. Mr. Cheek is to
sing again this evening.
Residence Burned.
The residence occupied by Bert
Stepnens in the B-ker addition was
burned last Sunday night or eariy
Monday morning. I
I Bert was the only occupant of the,
house at the time, his wife being,
away from homo visiting relatives at
Leon. He says he was awakened by]
fire dropping from the ceiling on the
bed in which he was sleeping and that'
the room was so full of smoke that'
he made his escape w'th difficulty.
The property was owned by Mrs.
Dora Baker.

LEON REPORTER.
THE CHILDREN'S TEETH.
Ottunnva Establishes Free Dental
Dispensary for Children.
The city of Ottumwa will establish
a free dental dispensary for all chil
dren of school age, as the result of
the effort of Dr. W. C. Boone, an old
Leou boy, now a prominent dentist
of Ottumwa in this worthy move
ment. At a meeting at which com
mittees were present representing
the Associated Charities, the Com
mercial Club and the dentists of Ot
tumwa, the plans for the establish
ment of the free dispensary were ex
plained by .ur. Boone, representing
the dentists of Ottumwa. Statistics,
he said, based on exhaustive investi
gations, indicated that many ills grow
out of neglect in the care of the teeth.
Rheumatism, heart lesions, the var
ious forms of neuritis, various vocal
infections, kidney troubles, impair
ment of digestion, and even appendi
citis are all traceable to a greater or
lesser degree to faults of the teeth.
The ill effects of bad teeth are not
confined to the physical side alone,
he said. It has been accepted as a
fact that children with bad teeth re
quire six months more time to com
plete the eightu grade school course
than do the children with sound
teeth. And moreover, those who are
entirely free from dental troubles
are very much in the minority, for
surveys at Boston and 'Minneapolis
have shown that ninety-eight per
cent of the children had dental faults
that should be corrected. Two broth
ers in Boston were the first to see
that something should be done to
remedy conditions and being wealthy
they established a million dollar dis
pensary in that city and are giving
tree service to all children who will
make use of it. Various cities all
over the country are now maintain
ing free dispensaries.
Having shown the need of a dis
pensary Dr. Boone then explained
the proposition which had been
made by the local dentists, ten of
them having promised to devote half
a day a week in turn to the dispen
sary when established. All that they
asked for was that suitable quarters
be furnished for the dispensary, the
necessary equipment and supplies.
The school board has provided a
room at one of the school buildings,
and the local committees appointed
have provided the necessary funds,
about *800 for equipment and $100
a year for supplies.
Leon has taree dentists and the
cost of a free dispensary in a city
the size of Leon would not amount
to very much. There are no doubt
many children in this city who are
suffering from bad teeth.

themes ana must be dated long in ad

BIG SUFFRAGE MEETING.
Ex-Mayor Hanna of Des Moines, Was
Speaker as Suffrage Meeting on
Monday Evening—Leon Men
Organize for Suffrage.
Leon now boasts of a Men's League
for Woman Suffrage. The movement
was launched in great Bhape Monday
evening at the big tabernacle. Hon.
James R. Hanna, former m»yor of
Des Moies was the speaker of the ev
ening. A large crowd had assembled
for the meetings, the tabernacle be
ing more than two-thirds filled. The
K. P. band was used to announce the
meeting down town. The crowd then
followed the band to the tabernacle
and the band gave the opening num
ber of the evening program. The
woman's suffrage organization had
special decorations for the occasion
and furnished the ushers small pen
nants, "Votes for Women," which
they pinned to everyone as they en
tered the tabernacle. Many of Leon's
prominent men were seated on the
platform and formed a male chorus
of unusual ability.
Leon's new mayor, Mr. Morris
Gardner presided and distinguished
himself as a speaker and a man of
splendid executive ability. Mayor
Gardner said that he had long since
espoused the cause of Woman's Suf
frage and that it has his hearty sup
port. Rev. Henry Esch gave the in
vocation. Miss Mabel Horner, chair
cif.n of the Decatur County Equal
Suffrage Association, was the first
speaker. Miss Horner is one of Leon's
popular speakers and always pleases
her audience. She said that she rep
lesented the women of Decatur coun
ty in their appeal for the privilege of
suffrage. She urged the justness of
the cause and that woman should not
be arrested in her development by
withholding from her the ballot.
Mayor Hanna was then introduced
and he proved to be a speaker of
much force and ability. He speaks
very deliberately and of a mature
judgment. One observing his measur
ed words and reasonable attitude to
ward issues, finds much to explain
why he was for three terms, Des
Moines popular mayor. Mr. Hanna
briefly review the evolutionary pro
cess of the race and showed how both
men and women had come to enjoy
more of the privilege and liberty, as
a result of enlightenment and ad
vanced civilization. He noticed some
of the objections made to woman suf
frage and stated that he had never
yet heard a real argument against
equal suffrage. He argued that the
cause of humanity is the greatest
concern of men and women. He said
that men want suffrage, because they
are men, and that equally so women
want suffrage because they are wom

To the Farmers Who Have Mares
Tliat Will Foal.
Within a short time your mares
will be foaling and you should have
a policy of foaling insurance.
I can sell you a contract that will
cover the mare and also the foal.
You simply notify me when the mare
foals and the policy is in force. This
means natural, premature or abor
tive, and it also covers disease, acci
dent, fire or lightning as well as foal
ing. If the mare proves barren we
return you 40 per cent of the pre
mium. Better put this insurance on
your mares. It guarantees your in
vestment on both mare and foal. Bet
ter be safe than sorry, and call me
up. I will drive out and explain it,
or if it is insurance of any kind, "ask
me." F. A. Townsend,
