ALL WRONG
The
Mistake Is Made by Many Oko
lona Citizens.
Look for the cause of backache.
To be cured you must know the
cause.
If it's weak kidneys you must set
the kidneys working right.
An Okolona resident tells you how.
J. W. Sanders, carpenter, Washing
ton & School Sts., Okolona, says: "I
was bothered by backache and sharp
pains across my - kidneys. My back
was bo weak and lame, it hurt me to
lift anything. I finally used Doan's
Kidney Pills and a couple of boxes
cured me. From that day to this, a
lapse of five years, I have worked
hard and have never felt the least
trouble with my back and kidneys."
Price 50c, at all dealers; Don't
pimply ask for a kidney remedy get
Doan's Kidney Pills the same that
cured Mr. Sanders. Foster-Mllburn

Ugh! A Dose of
Nasty Calomel
It salivates! It makes you sick
and you may lose a
day's work
You're bilious, sluggish, constipated
and believe you need vile, dangerous
calomel to start your liver and clean
your bowels.
Here's my guarantee! Ask your
drugtfist for a 50 cent bottle of Dod
son's Liver Tone and take a spoonful
tonight. If it doesn't start your liver
and straighten you right up better
than calomel and without griping or
making you sick I want you to go back
to the store and get your money.
Take calomel today and tomorrow
you will feel weak and sick and nau
seated. Don't lose' a day's work.
Take a spoonful of harmless, vegetable
Dodson'g Liver Tone tonight and
wake up feeling great. It'a perfectly
harmless, so give it to your children
any time. It can't salivate, bo let
them eat anything afterwards. advj
