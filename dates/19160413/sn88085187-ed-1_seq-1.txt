carranza

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 13. Carranza has
asked the withdrawal of U. S. troops from Mexico,
The receipt of his note, suggesting that the time
has come for the Americans to leturn to their own
borders, was announced today by Elisco Arredondo,
( Cazzanzt's representative in Washington.
The note has not yet been given to Secretary Lan
sing, but probably will be delivered late this after
noon.
Although it is inadvisable for U. S. troops to with
draw from Mexico now, a break between the United
States and the dl facto government is inevitable if
Carransa's request is not granted, according to the
opinion of high military authorities.
Many officers believe the troops will be with
drawn.
The embassy declared that it was not an ultimat
um or a demand that the Americans withdraw from
the Villa chase.
