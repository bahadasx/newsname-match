Fit perfeotfit do you know what it means
in underweai especially union suits
We believe that Munsingwear union suits will
give you a new idea of underwear fit
The way they cover the form without gap-
inp nt the Reat the manner in which they give
and take with every twist of the body and every
contractions of the muscles without binding at
the crotch has been a surprise and delight to
iillicns
And the beauty of the Munsingwear fit is that
It doesnt wash out The comfort of
wear lit is further increased by sof tness of the
elastic Munsingwear yarns the Bmooth seams
the perfect crotch and perfectly balanced gore
in the seat The prices of Munsingwear gar
ments are very moderate much less perhaps
than you imagine for such fine quality The
range of fabrics styles and weights is very wide
They are made for men women and children
There is a correct fitting Munsingwear gar
ment for you in any style weight or fabric de
sired Ask us to show you

the big force worked all day with re
markable smoothness und system
Every business house In Jasper was
askpd to give the services of one man
ami In several cases a man undjteum

and their own services and worked in
hearty cooperation within Commer
cial Club and for this cooperation the
club is very appreciative Will Luu

ford were among those who came from
several miles oust and west for the priv
ilege of hnving a part in the work
Road Boss Itlll Stark turned the
whole job over to the Commercial Club
for the day and worked all day hand
ling rock
When the rock crusher was put on
the job last month the crew began at
the baseline and worked north for an
eighth of a mile Then the crusher
was brought up tD the Pleasant
lllll Schoolhouse because rock was
convenient at Multipoint and started
south toward the point where they left
olT They worked south about an
eighth of a mile when the rains and cold
weather stoppetl the work until Tues
day When the crusher crew and their
work is mentioned it is to be under
stood that this crew is crushing the
rock and spreading it over the road 10
inches thick and 18 feet wide
On Tuesday Mayor Hayzlett had
charge of the crusher Secretary Pert

teams and drivers V C Thomasand

When the days work was done and
measured it was found that 5S0 feet of
road 18 feet wide had been covered with
crushed rock 10 inches thick and stone
piled along the road for ti quarter of a
mile enough to keep the crusher going
nearly a week Altogether H21 loads of
rock were hauled und piled along the
road ready for the crusher

appreciation of the enthusiasm

Death from Diptheria
Pauline the little daugh
ter of J A Wine mid wife passed away
Saturday afternoon of diptheria
Pauline nnd her little brother Sammy
were taken with the disease about two
weeks ago
and both the children improved at
once their throats being relieved and
breathing becoming cisy but as It
happens in some case- the diptheria
poison alTected the little girls heart
with the above fatal result
The death of this bright little girl is
an exceptionally hard blow for the
parents nnd other relatives She was
I an nlTectlonate and obedient child at
One of the first things proposed to the
homc nnd n gohoo nn ovei b old
I
and young alike Paulines death is
sincerely mourned by a large circle of
friends and relative
Short services were held ip the yard
at the family home Sunday afternoon
and the little body laid away In the
Brethren Cemetery
The house was fumigated nnd the
quarantine rnlsed Tuesday
Dtbating Class Revived
It happened out at Xnshville lust
week They were engaged in the one
time popular rural amusement the
debating class The utibject Resolv
ed that women shouTd be allowed to
vote was proving of interest A con
firmed bachior who had the negative
side said Woman should not be
allowed to vote because she is so easily
deceived
His Opponent Mr Chairman I
cant see how he makes that out 1
call you to witness that my bachelor
friend has never succeeded in deceiv
ing any woman into matrimony with
him nnd goodness knows hes tried
hard enough
Peaches in Bloom
Theonly peach trees in bloom report
ed at this office are those at the home
of Mrs Chas Whilmore Mrs Whit
more says all the trees on her place are
uiouiiiing as intuitu noiiiiiig nun i nip
pen ed to peaches In this section the past
winter
worked steadily all day and got a good
photo of the men in action
There were two things that every
body was unanimous on and they were
the courtesy and hospitality of Fred
Norton when he gave the use of his
home and premises at noon wliere the
workers were fed and the dinner
couldnt be beat is the unanimous
comment The dinner was served and
provided by the Ladies Aid Society of
Salem Church The ladies did not
want to be paid but expected to con
tribute the dinner as their donation to
the work But the Executive board of
the club felt that the ladies ought to
accept an evidence of their apprecia
tion and gave them a check for 82
Pete Brand of Brand and Dun-
woody Joplin came up and took din
ner with the boys When dinner was
overlie wrote his check for 10 to be used
by the club for road work
All in all it was a good days work
and everybody came back pleased with
what had been accomplished for the
Jefferson Highway
Bert Webb said yesterday One of
the finest things about it all was that
it went off so smoothly Everydody
worked nobody loafed and theje was
no ill feeling and not an ugly spot in
the days experience

Does Aiti Toxin Affect the Heart
In an interview with Dr Knott re
garding the effect of diphtheria anti
toxin on the heart the Doctor said
It is unfortunate that some people
will hold to the idea that the anti toxin
given to counteract diphtheria some
times alTccts the heart of the patient
with fatal results It is the diphtheria
poison in the sstem that ulTects the
heart and as in little Pauline Wines
case if the anti loiu had not been
given and if she had escaped choking
to death which is doubtful then very
likely her heart would have failed
anyway
Take Their Cue From Jasper
S L Callison and Wallace Griflin a
committee from the Lamar Commerci
al Club were in Jasper last Thursday
to examine the credit system recent
ly adopted by the Jasper Coiiuneicial
Club The gentlemen expressed their
approval of the- system litre and went
home and recommended it totheirclub
Business men recocnie the necessity
of credit to the farmer but for their
own protection and also for the benefit
of the honest creditor a system of list
ing or classification has become neces
sary to indicate who is entitled to credit
by reason of his recoid for meeting his
obligations
