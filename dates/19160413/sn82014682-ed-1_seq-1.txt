of . cbl. Z. 3- Spalding's fainoua Ma

Star-Bulletin last Monday afternoon.
"We havef handled the cane for all
but eight of the 86 homesteaders In
the Kapaa district" Wilcox continued,
and . we T have never heard a single
kick from any of them. We have gone
ahead quietly and -fairly with all of
them. It wasn't the homesteader who
caused all of the present excitement
..Wilcox smiled when asked who was
back of the excitement. "You prob
ably know- as well as ,1 do," he said.
"1 prefer not to mention names."
Wilcox says he be neves that Kealia
Is the natural outlet for Kapaa cano
fields, and that In his opinion all of
the homesteaders up there - are
"mighty' glad to.see the Makee roads
building In the district.
In a ride which a representative of
th Star-Bulletin took with Wilcox
on Monday, the company's railroad fa
cilities were pointed out. -::-
According to the manager the com
pany now has approximately 30 milea
of road, seven miles of-vhich have
been constructed In the last year and
a half. ' . . . ' ; ; . ; .
'Our, roads reach now within a mile
of any homestead," said Wilcox in
pointing out the manner In which, the

ures of Chief of Detectives McDuffie
this morning when Pedro Ardeca, the
Filipino who was brought back from
San Francisco by McDuffle on several
embezzlement . charges, pleaded not
guilty in police court. The chief says
that Ardeca admitted to him, before
his accusers, that - he had received
sums from each of ihem. ; '
'The charge is that Ardeca went to
five of hfs fellow laborers on a Maui
plantation: and told them a story off
Kia rrthn wIia i1rt a err. It'rr t1ft.
month in San Francisco, and offered
them jobs inva Southern California
ranch iirdject ' He advised his friends
to let him be their manager and hold
their savings so as to make ail th
arrangements for their transportation
at one time. Then Pedro went to two
'other. friends working on a plantation
at Waipahu with the same proposi
tion.; They also bit. Having some
thing like $600, Ardeca left for San
Francisco without taking any of the
others with him. V
The victims became ' suspicious of
Pedro's non-appearance' for several
days 'and notified the police just In
time for the officials at San Francisco
to be wired and apprehend Ardeca.
