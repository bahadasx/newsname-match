TI10 completeness of Denver's facili
ties fur handling grain may hare
escAped tlio nttentinn of some of our
farmer friends, nnd it if the purpose of
this article to give you a detailed list
of the elevators and grain buyers cow
operating in this city.
There are now four elevators In op
eratlon, equipped with all the latest
machinery and using the most approv
id methods of handling and storing
grain. There Is a buyer in charge of
of each plant, and they offer the high
est price the grade of your grain and
the market allows. No market in the
country has any better facilities than
has Heaver at present. In fact there
jre but few cities that can claim an
equality with us. No market can offer
and pay the highest market prices on
less that market Ijas the facilities for
handling the grain, and Beaver cer
tainly meets this requirement.
The newest of our elevators opened
up for business this week. This is the
B illn-Ilall Grain Company, whose
home olllce is at Hutchinson, Kansas.
The local buyer, K. J. Horn, is well
known to Heaver County farmers as an
experienced grain man, one who
knows his business thoroughly, and
who treats his patrons courteously and
in a strictly honest manner.
The Probst Grain Company have had
their local elevator in operation for
some time, and are buying whratt
katrlr, maize and barley. The head'
olllce of this company Is located at
Arkansas City, Kantaj, while the local

well known throughout the county,
and is a live wire when it comes to

were taking their grain to any other
market.
In addition to the four elevators now

firms engaged In buying grain here,

WHAT IS A "CANTATA?"
Since the "Cantata of Jephtha" ha
been announced a number of people
hare asked this question: "What is a
Cantata?"
A Cantata is a narrative poem. It
may be either sacred or secular, but
is most generally accepted to be
a short period of Scripture history set
to music and exhibited with dramatic
action. In other words, a cantata is,
primarily, a Bhort sacred opera. An
Oratorio ia an opera, but taken from
sacred instad of profane biography.
There have been written only a few
crtd oratorios and cantatas. The
orxtoriiiR that will live always are
"The Messiah," and "Elijah," and the
cantatas of "Esther," and "Jephtha
and His Daughter" will endure be
cause of the poetic rendering of the
narrative, the acting of the characters
and the beautiful music.
In the Cantata of "Jephtha," which
will be given at the Globe Opera House
on April 17th, the history of a perilous
time for Israel will be acted before
you. There will be tho elders of Israel
pleading with the outcaBt Jephthn to
come back home and save them from
the fury of the Ammonites; the great
rejoicing of the people when Jephtha
consents; the appearance of the proph
et, the petition, "Oh, hear thy peopU'
prayers;" the marching warriors; the
battle and the victory ; the battlefield,
the dead on the field, the finding of
the body of Eloni by his sister, Naomi,
and her grief; the rash vow of Jeph
tha ; the rejoicing for the victory ; the
meeting of Jephtha and his daughter,
Iphlgenia, and the grief and despair of
Jephtha and the petition of Iphlgenia
for time to mourn with her maidens;
the sacrifico of Iphlgenia; tho grand
finale "We will meet you in the
morning, whero the shadows come no
more, nevermore."
This Is one of the most beautiful and
heart touching stories In the Bible
Rnd the story In Judges. ,
