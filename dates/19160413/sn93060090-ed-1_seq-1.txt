Here My Call.
Fathers, Mothers, Brothers.
Sisters, and Friends, unto you I
call.
FATHERS, yon who are the
head of the family as Christ Ms
the bead of the church. Do, you
not want the truth, to walk by,
and to live by. Inorder to set an
example before your family and
the world, as Christ did before
the church , and the world
From all appearance you do
not want to be like Christ. For
In rejecting the truth you reject
the right, which laaves you out
upon the-cold mountain of se)
bsbneas. Which brings to your
door of life strife and contention,
and a hatred of all good. . We
are offering you God's eternal
truths free of charge. And ydu
bate us for it. And say all man
ner of evil against us for it.
twiners we want to do you
good. For tbis reason we set
up at nights, while the world is
wrapped in sleep and slumber
and write to give you the truth
of the word, bat you will not
have it. Fathers turn ye. and
accept the troth, hear the truth,
and d the truth. Set the ex
ample before your family and the
world so that it will bring peace,
Love and Friendship to all the
world. For why will ye die?
We offer you the truth, do not
bate us for it. We offer you
peace, by the truth.- envy us not
for it. Let the Golden rule be
your guide this we offer you, de
spise us not for it.
MOTIIERS. read the Cresset
for the benefit of your family and
the good of the .world. And
follow in the foot prints of the
church in the days of the apos
ties. Be a Lydia in the great
work of the Lord.
BROTHERS, why take such
an exception to the truth. Which
will make you free but ye will
not the world has to much of a!
bold on you. But our advice to
you is to shake off the works of
darkness and put on the armor
of light,. Read the Cresset, and
if heeded you will walk in the
light as God is in the light and
you tnen win nave ieiiowsoip
one with another., and be saved.
SISTERS, under tho direc
tion of the CRESSET you will
be lead to the shadow of the rock
that will shield you from danger
noth seeu and unseen. And
your (ife will be a life pt right
eousness. And a life well spent
in the services ot the Lord. '
FRIENDS, we call you friends
because there was no name
more dearer to Christ than
Friends. He called His disciples
Friends. So we say Jto' friend
and foe we are hem to do you all
the good we can with just as
little barm as we can. But
yon will not bear us, when we
speak the truth to you for your
eternal welfare You say no I
will not. listen Rev. so and so,
said 'Garrett is not right I there
fore Will not listen - to him.
May God help you to hear the
truth and obey it.
THE cresset:
It is said that "Self praise, is
half scandle." In some1 instances
tbis may be true. ? And It may
be that some egotistic against
the truthi may say tbis about us
Yet we wish to say, that our
life since 1886 has been entirely
dedicated to the great ; Bible
Truths, given to us by a; cruci
fied Lord,,; And there is no other
paper during the same dark past
has bad such a struggle with
the foes of right as f 'TiiE
World's Cresset" has . " It has
been a deadly fight 365 ditfs out
of a year. And those fov has
been men who claimed toie call
ed of God to do a worke r men
and God. But during all those
years of this hard fought oattle,
the Cresset has lived, and will
live, until the cross of Christ is
lifted above the door of every
home, as an ensign of peace, and
Good will .with all men.: And
Bible Socialism rules ..Mje .uni
verse, and all men res under
its beautiful folds,' which will
shield- 09 from dangers both
seen and unseen. And every
man sitting under his o'V vine
Snd'""ffg tree, and-w&eo4-
man dare molest or mane afraid
Help the Cresset to doits
peaceful work in Christ.
THIS BRINGS .US UP
HOME INDUSTRY,
TO
Home Industry, is laid down
in the word of God . And this
fact has been taught thru the
Columns of the CRESSET for
the many years of its life. And
today it stands for the glorious
principles of Home Industry.
For God spake and said;
'.'And I will make them
covenant of peace, and will cause
tne evl1 hea8ta to cease out of
the" land; and tbey shall dwell
safely in the wilderness, and
sleep in the woods.
' And I will make them and
the places round about my bill a
blessing ; and I will cause the
showers to come down in bis
season; there 'Shalt be showers
of blessing
And the tree of the- field shall
yield b6r fruit, and the earth
shall yield her 'increase, and
tbey shall be safe in their land,
and shall kno w .battel am the
Lord, when I have broken the
bands of their 7:ke, aad deliver
ed tbem out of the hand: of those
that served themselves of them."
Ezek. 34-25-27.
Also read;
' And tbey shall build bouses!
and inhabit them ; and. tbey shall
plant vineyards, and . eat ' the
fruit of tbem,
Tbty shall not build and an
other inhabit, they shall not
plant and another eat; t for as
the days. of a tree, are the days
of -my'' people, and . mine elect
shall , long -enjoy the work of
i their bauds. .

Tbey shall not labour in vain,
nor bring forth for tr ouble; for
tbey are the blessed of the seed
of the Lord and their offspring
with them"" Isaiah 05-21 23.
The Reader will see plainly
that God . intends his people to
live in Peace. They are to be one
heart and one soul. Such a
government as this would not
rob the poor of their hard earn
ed bread. It would abase the
high and exalt the low, placing
evtry man on an equal footing,
and keep them there.
But the one man theory
preacher would beg the last
penny from the widows purse,
Inorder to increase his own
purse, so as to live sumptuously
every day. So we beg for the
comrades of Socialism to come
up to the help of the Lord in the
relief of your fellow men who are
held in chains of thraldom by
the monev trod of earth. And
you can do this in no better way
than to help the CRESSET,
So that it may enlighten all
who read its Columns, so then
help to circulate the CRESSET.

Brother Editor:
(QUESTION.)
I have another Question to ask
and wish aorae light on the fol
lowing scriptures.
"And the Lord God, said unto
the Serpent, Because thou hast
done this thou art cursed above
all cattle, and above ever beast
of the field : upon thy bellyishalt
thou go and dust shalt thou eat
all the days of thy life. And I
will put enmity between thee
and the woman, and between thy
seed and her seed, it shall
bruise thy head, and thou shall
bruise his heel." Gen. 8-14-15.
Wat represents the nerpent
going on his belly eating dust
this day and time, and wbat re
presents the Serpents head, tbis
day and time. And wbat repre
sents the brusing of his heel
this day and time.
Give us all the light voir cac
Bro. Yours in Love and Truth

Brother Garret I suppose I
am indebted to you on subscrip
tion ; so send the enclosed dollar
bill
I fully believe you are rightly
dividing the scriptures relative
to the Jew and Gentile as having
a different origin. Any other in
terpretation begets endles dim
culties and envolves the whole
subject in a mass of contradic
tions.
Hoping for the speedy entrance
of the day when Christianity
shall supplant the religions of
the world, that, today uphold
Commercial greud and lend aid
in training boys for human
slaughter, I remain yours "etc"

Yes Brother the Two Men
Theory will do away with the
Coniuoerdal System of 'greed
and gain to the few and making
slaves of the mnuy . It will bring
about socialism in its pure state.
Help us hoist the banner of
"No war, and Peace to all,"
