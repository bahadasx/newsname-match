fused to comment ri the Car
ranza government's demand for
the withdrawal of American
troops in Mexico. He declared
h would have nothing1 to say
until he heard from Washing
ton. Amoj g the officers here the
recent movements of Carranza
troops in Sonora are believed to
have been made in expectation
of such a demand being mad
on the American government.
International News Servl'-e:
KI, PA.C. Texas. April IS. Gen.
Pershing's expedition in Mexico, es
timated to number now 14,000 men,
is surrounded today by more than
twice that number of Carranzistas
waiting for the diplomatic "show
down" that must follow the de facto
Mexican government's demand that
the United States troops be with
drawn. This fact was clearly shown In all
reports reaching" the border today
from Mexico. They revealed that
Minister of War Obregon is sending
Carranza's troops to advantageous
tactical positions along1 the Ameri
can line of communication.
Gen. Arnulfo Gome, who has
dramatically announced that he will
be known in history as "Plack"
Gomez because of the ni.mber of
'gringoes" he will kill, is headed
eastward from fonora with a force
of approximately 0,000 men.
Gen. Obregon has also ordered
4,500 men into the Cusihuiriachic
district, where Gen. Pershing's most
advanced sub-base is located. An
other force of :',500 is reported to
be on its way toward the American
front from further south.
'10,000 .Men in Hour.
The American state department
has already been apprised that 10.
000 Mexican troops hae taken posi
tions between the United States
troops anj the border. In addition
to these there are regular Carranza
commands all along tre line of ad
vance. The American forces are
scattered along a line of communi
cation 4 Qo miles long.
The official Carranza explanation
for these military movements is that
"Villa must be pursued," but the
border observers say that the situa
tion seems obvious: That Carranza
troops are prepared to back up Car
ranza's demands that the United
States expedition be withdrawn.
It is known that Gen. Funston has
asked for more troops to handle the
situation. From a military view
point .the American forces would be
in a sc-rious predicament if Pres't
Wilson refused to grant Carranza's
demands.
The hurit for Francisco Villa waa
overshadowed today by the tension
developing over the Carranza de
mands. One report sa.d the bandit
chief was in the ßlstin? valley par
leying with the Arritta brothers,
who control .?,1'0 men. Another sa;3
that he had arrived at Guadeloupe
y Calvo. a high plateau, w hich forma
a natural fortress.
Mexican advices said that Ameri
can troopers pursuing Villa had
crossed the Duraneo state line and
proceeded as far as Roj-aho. hut had
returned into Chihuahui when their
supplies were exhausted.

Pershing Will Continue Pur

Thoroughly Consider
ed Latest Note.
TROOPS ARE IN DANGER
OF BEING WIPED OUT
International Nrws Sendee:
WASHINGTON', April 13. The
United States will not withdraw its
forces from interior Mexico at pres
ent. That was the pffciÜon taken by
officialdom today In discussing the
demand of the de facto Mexican
government contained in the com
munication sent to Ambassador
Designate Arredondo for transmis
sion to Seo'y of State Lansing by
Candido A-guilar, Mexican foreign
secretary. Until the note has been
thoroughly considered by Pres't Wil
son and Sec'y Irnsing no official
statemert of position will be made.
Put at the white house and state de
partment officials said that the ex
pedition will continue its pursuit of
Villa for the present.
Officials familiar with the Mexican
situation said that it was almost cer
tain that this government will make
a reply to the note in which it will
ak that Carranza explain in what
manner he Is ready to take over the
task of f,ettinj Villa. Tt will discuss
the allegation that the expedition
entered Mexico under a mistaken
idea of the Carranzista government's
willingness that it take that step. Put
the I'nited States will not -oneede.
officials say, that it has not the right
under stahllshed precedent to pur
sue bandits who have murdered
American citizens in their own homes
until they are killed or captured.
Favor Stiff Attitude.
How' far this policy is to be pur
sued no one in Washington was will
ing to venture a guess today. That
will he cetermined by the president
himself. The majority of his ad
visers are said to he in favor of
adopting a stiff attitude toward Car
ranza in the belief that If this is
done the Mexican de facto govern
ment will accept the inevitable and
will make no effort to Interfere with
the American forces. Put it is ad
mitted that the president may over
rule that suggestion if he Is con
vinced that the Carranzista govern
ment is really in earnest in its de
claration that it can get Villa with
its own forces.
The situation confronting this gov
ernment is extremely serious. High
army officers fear that as soon as
the Aguilar note reaches the Car
ranzista forces in northern Mexico
they may attack the American
forces, They say that the position of
the Pershing advance uard is ex
tremely lanjrerous. The cavaJry is
short of supplies, the horses are al
most completely exhausted and if
attacked by strong forces would he
in danger of annihilation. Many of
the high staff officers here declare
that at least 50,00 additional men
are urgently needed and favor an
immediate call for the national
guard,.
Raker Vnfer With I- n-i tut.
Sec'y Baker conferred at length
with Sec'y Lansing today and it was
admitted that the Mexican situation
was the topic of discussion. Paker
9
presented to his colleague all of the
reports from Gen. Funston decline
with the difficulties in getting sup
plies to the front and urging that
the situation may be remedied im
mediately. It is said that Sec'y
Paker aluo presented reports show
ing1 the disposition of the Carran
zista troops at points where they are
a serious menace to the American
lines of communication.
Neither of the officials would dis
cuss their conferences or say whether
any definite decision was reached.
They planned to confer with th
president today if possible.
The txt of the Aguilar note
reached the Mexican embassy early
today and Amt assador-Desjgnate Ar
redondo immediately translated it in
person, lie planned to present it in
person to Sec'y Lansing" onie time
during the afternoon. !.ut as this
was diplomatic day it was not neces
sary to make a definite engagement.
Several of th South American
ambassadors and ministers discussed
the general Mexican situation with
Sec'y Larslne during the day, but
none of them would tray anything" on
leaving, explaining that they had
been requested not to talk.

everything was calm, but underneath the surface commotion was

Mexican officials believe that Pres't Wilson cannot keep the

American offcials were silent.
A high Mexican official, on condition that his name be withheld,
said :
"We now have more troops in the field than your United States.
We teel that the Pershing expedition really was an invasion, but
that it was all a mistake and will be forgiven if withdrawal comes
