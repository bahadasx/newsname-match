of sending your gowns, dresses

Kl, I'A SO, TKN., April 12?A band
of \ tllii followers numbering several

the Ooahuila line and eighty miles e;tpit
of .limine/., destroying many thousands
of dollars' worth of American ,<ropcrty
ami looting tite town of everything of
; value.
This news, which may prove to ho
of the highest Importance, as it is be
lieved Villa himself was among tics
ratders. was received hoi-- to-day by
the representative of the largest
American muting concerns in Mexico,
anil is accepted l?v him as authentic.
The bandits mailt? their attack on the
town on April They came from
Kscalon. a (unction point on the Mexi
can National Railroad. sixty miles
southeast of .limine/, and about an
equal distance southwest of Sierra
Mojada. which has its connection by
the Mexican Xorth western Railroad.
On the way lo Sierra Mojada they
sacked the town of Oorriileo.

i The belief thai Villa himself may ha
ditcctiug the operations of his bard
is supporled by a report received to
day front Ojinaga stating that Colonel
Rojas. the commander there, had in
formation that Villa had doubled in
his tracks, and was 200 miles south
j west of that town.
Ojinaga Is directly across the bor
der from Ragle J'ass. ami about lf<0
miles distance north of Sierra Mojada.
Another circumstance that gives color
lo the belief that Villa himself Ih with
| the band Is a report from Torroon a
! weelt ago that lieneral Cantu Reyes,
Villa's chief, was traveling north to
join the Villa band. Disposition to
help the American troops, who have
been driving .south .it an amazing
speed, and are reported to-day from
a reliable source to be well south of
I'arral and close upon the bandits, is
si ill ma it I feste.tt.

I.ittie credence is 31 wit reports h're

the bandit, i!" hi- is a' Sierra Mejadn,

inaccessible spot for the concentration

in force on Torreon after American
Iroops nrc withdrawn from Mexico.
Numerous reports from Mexican
sources asjiee that Villa is convinced
