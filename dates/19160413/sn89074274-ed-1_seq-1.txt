VOL. XXXV—NO. 49. (Official County Paper)
El Paso, April 11.—Passengers who
.arived here today from Chihuahua City
brought a new version of the story of
the injury which Villa received at
Guerrero, March 30.
It was said that Andreas Rehaza
shot Villa through the leg after the
bandit chieftain had outraged Reha
za's daughter. The Villistas caught
Rehaza and Villa personally sent a bul
let crashing through the father's brain,
although the outlaw at the time was
•suffering so from the wound in his leg
he could not stand.
Mexico City, April 11.—Francisco
Villa has left the main body of his
command and is hiding almost unat
tended in the Sierra mountains of Chi
huahua, according to information giv
en out at the war department today.
The last of his retreating forces passed
through the town of Cusihuiriachio,
Chihuahua, yesterday in the flight to
ward the mountains. They were close
ly pursued by forces of the de facto
government who hoped to capture the
band and locate the leader.
El Paso, Texas, April 11.—The pur
suit of Villa probably will be brought
to a definite conclusion within 48
hours, according to information re
ceived here today by an American
mining concern with large interests
at Parral and Torreon.
The message received stated that
the report that Villa was dead was
current throughout southern Chihua
hua and northern Durango, and while
it was still far from confirmed it was
^expected that definite news would be
received within the next few days.
There are only two possibilities
which are accepted here as true in the
present situation either Francisco
Villa is dead and his pursuit is auto
matically ended or he is far to the
south in central Durango. If the lat
ter is true, army officers say that the
entire plan of campaign of General
Pershing must be completely reor
ganized or abandoned altogether.
The report of Villa's death was ac
cepted as highly probable by General
Bertani, and the Carranza commander
at Casas Grandes, who is now in
Juarez.
"There is only one doctor in the
country where Villa is now," said
General Bertani, "and if blood poi
•soning has set in in Villa's wounded
leg as my information has it, the doc
tor can do nothing even if he had a
•chance."
General Bertani said that Villa had
not more than 50 men with him.
"Villa's forces consist now of only
a few handfuls," commented Bertani,
"who will have to be hunted down
like ordinary escaped criminals."
The Apache scouts have gone into
Mexico from Columbus, it was learned
tonight, led by Peaches, the captor of
Geronimo. They started south on top
of motor trucks. Each Apache wore
sun goggles and a wrist watch.
Happy Birthday Surprise
Tuesday afternoon, April 11, was the
occasion of a' very pretty little sur
prise party at the home of Mrs. A. G.
Wilson, in honor of the eighth birth
day of her little daughter, Beth. The
eight little guests enjoyed a number
of games, after which they were ush
ered into the dining room, where the
table was prettily decorated in yellow
and white, with Easter favors. At
the close of a very delicious supper,
the room was darkened and the birth
day cake with its eight yellow can
dles was brought in and lighted. Short
ly after supper the little guests climb
ed into Mr. Wilson's new car and
were taken to .their respective homes
In care of 'Mr- Wilson and Miss Edith.
Little Miss Beth was the recipient of
many birthday remembrances, and
wishes that birthdays came oftener.
Those present were Gladys and Jane
Barton, Alice Witter, Rhea Lund,
Mary Louise Selden, Janet Kirkaby,
Margaret and Joseph James and Miss
Young, Beth's teacher.
Villa Is Shot by Injured
Father, Whom He Kills
Rev. C. E. Vermilya is expecting an
old college friend, Rev. C. S. Buchanan,
the last of the week and hopes to have
him here with him over Sunday. Rev.
Buchanan has spent about 20 years in
the mission field, most of the time be
ing spent in Java.
Mr. and Mrs. Fred Fulmer left Sun
day for Williamsport, Penn., for a visit
of some two months.
I
Sheyenne Is Still Pretty High
The Sheyenne has joined the rest of
the rivers of the state in their spring
rampage and is making things rather
lively for some who live near the
banks, and for the owners of boats.
Tuesday evening there was an unus
ually rapid rise, and boats that were
out on the river In the afternoon and
put back into the boat houses safely
in the late afternoon were in danger of
being lost with the boat house by 8
p. m. A crowd of workmen were at
tempting to break the ice-jam formed
at one of the bridges crossing the
stream and huge cakes of ice were
freed and sent down the river, but it
is feared they will form a gorge far
ther down or grind the numerous boat
houses from their fastenings. The wa
ter is up to Main street east of the
power house and basements in that
part of town are flooded. Many boats
which were hauled up high and dry are
now floating and some of the boat
houses are also submerged. The pow
er plant has not been endangered any
as the water would have to get quite
a bit higher before it could affect it.
Reports say that the water was going
down Wednesday.

and Bobolink" by Mrs. Boughton "The
Northern Flicker and Grosbeak" by
Mrs. Greenwood "Our Best Song
sters" by Mrs. Witter and "Sight and
Hearing of Birds" by Mrs. Veblen. A

the county auditor in regard to as
sessing.
Gub Presents Many
Plays Tins Season
Members of the Normal school Dra
matic club are still being commended
for their work on Saturday evening,
when a cast presented Tennyson's
"The Princess." It is interesting to
know that this is only one of the plays
with which Miss Dewey and the club
concern themselves this year.
Instead of limiting themselves to
only one play a season as has been the
custom in other years, the members of
the club prepared and presented a
playlet every two or three weeks dur
ing the winter months. Plays of al
most every type were studied, learned
and presented before club members or
the students of the school.
"The Princess" was selected for a
public production and was well receiv
ed. Costumes were furnished by a
Chicago costumer.
Hazel Whiting played the tittle role,
the princess who in her infancy was
betrothed to the Prince, played by
Maida Hollett. Refusing to carry out
the plans the Princess withdraws from
the world and founds a maiden univer
sity. The Prince, in love with a pic
ture of the Princess, goes to win her
by stratagem, accompanied by Florian,
played by Delia Staples, and 'Cyril,
played by Minnie Ellingson.
They gain entrance to the Maiden
university, but their disguise is pene
trated. In spite of the sign over the
gates, "Let No Man Enter Here on
Pain of Death," all ends as such situa
tions inevitably do and all are happy.
Other players who deserve special
mention for their effort are: Lady
Psyche, Lily Wilkinson Lady Blanche,
Mertice Aldahl Melissa, Lucile Bar
nes Gama, Sarah Folk Ipse, Ruth
Witter.
One of the features that deserve spe
cial mention is the statuary that adorn
ed the hall of. Maiden' University.
Mable Wohl was an excellent Athena.
Pansy Wilkinson posed as Joan of Arc,
and Orma Mahin as the painting, St.
Cecelia.

carnation as a souvenir of the occas

Governor Hanna Names
Arbor and Bird Day
State of North Dakota, Executive
Department.
The song of the meadow-lark,
The honk of the geese, I hear
The sun, the rain,' the buds, the leaves,
The flowers of yesteryear.
It is unnecessary to dwell at length
upon the pecuniary benefits to be de
rived by our people from the extension
of tree culture and plant life in our
state. Trees are one of nature's grand
est gifts to man, not only from'a com
mercial standpoint, but they also tend
in large measure to make our sur
roundings more agreeable, beautifying
our homes, parks and public grounds,
thereby contributing to the happiness
and contentment of our people.
The propagation and conservation of
trees, plants and shrubs is closely al
lied with the care and protection of
bird and animal life. What gave us
greater joy in springtime, when, as
children, we wandered through woods
and fields, listening to the song of the
lark and the call of the thrush, spying
out the nest of the woodpecker and
wild canary, or perhaps playing peek
with the wren and saucy chipmunk?
With continued settlement, the wild
bird and animal life of our country Is
gradually disappearing and it, be
hooves us, if for no other reason than
the future enjoyment of our children,
to do our utmost in the protection and
conservation of those things which go
to make beautiful our farms, homes
and public grounds.
In order that we may show our ap
preciation of the benefits derived from
these messengers of a glorious spring
time, I, L. B. Hanna, governor, do here
by proclaim and set apart, Friday,
April 28, as
ARBOR AND BIRD DAY
in the state of North Dakota for the
year 1916, and I earnestly recommend
that the day be suitably observed by
the students in our colleges, the teach
ers and children in our schools, our
public officials and the people gener
ally throughout North Dakota.
Done at the capital at Bismarck, this
25th day of March, A. D." 1916.

were introduced to fine advantage,
under the direction of Misses Cranz
and Gilbert. Miss Deem had charge
of the posing of the statuary and of
the wardrobe and make-up rooms.
The production was directed by Miss
Martha E. Dewey, instructor in read
ing and expression. Under her direc
tion the Dramatic club has progressed
vigorously during the present year and
much work has been' accomplished to
good advantage. Not only has she the
entertainment features of dramatics
in mind, but the educational as well,
and especially from the teacher's stand
point.
A good audience rewarded the club
for its efforts Saturday evening.

Victim of Pleasant Surprise
Mrs. S. Anderson, or Main street,
mother of Mrs. C. F. Jensen and Mi'ss
Nettie Anderson, was surprised Tues
day when about 30 ladies of the neigh
borhood walked into her home and
spent the afternoon. They came with
well filled lunch baskets and the pleas
ant social visit was enhanced by the
delightful luncheon served later. At
the close of the afternoon Rev. Nae
seth spoke a few words fitting the oc
casion, commenting on the advanced
age of the honor guest, she being al
most 80 years old, and presented her
with a well filled purse as a token of
esteem from her friends. She was also
the recipient of a big bunch of carna
tions and ferns.
Travel One Hundred
Miles Under Water
The Williamson submarine pictures,
which are to be shown at the Rex next
Monday night, take us on a journey,
nearly one hundred miles in length,
which is filled with adventure and dis
coveries along the floor of the ocean—
the most marvelous trip in the world
—viewing enchanted sea gardens of
the West Indies exploring 50-year-old
wrecks by deep sea divers, crossing
ocean meadows inhabitated by canni
bal sharks, watching strange denizens
of the deep in their native haunts—
and finally the most surprising scene
ever photographed—a life-risking com
bat between one of the Williamson
brothers and a man-eating shark in
front of the camera under the ocean.
The photographer is located inside
a small chamber with a powerful
lens exposed to the wall of water
and ,by the assistance of a powerful
light that illumines the sea about him
takes his picture through a port-hole,
made of thick glass. The observation
chamber is attached to a collapsible
submarine tube down which the pho
tographer descends to a depth of two
hundred and fifty feet, but this tube
has been lengthened since the pic
tures were taken in the Bahamas and
the Williamson brothers have built
one now which can descend one thou
sand feet beneath the surface of the
water.
Such pictures as were obtained by
this method have never before been
seen. They are wonderful in their
variety, in their sensational incidents
such as the shark's fight and in the
meird landscapes seen at the bottom
of the sea. Coral formations and men
diving to gather sponges are some of
the wonderful scenes depicted by this
film.
The pictures are as clear and bril
liant as though made in a studio, and
yet they were taken under the crystal
waters of the West Indian seas.
The Universal Film Manufacturing
company has purchased these films
from the Williamson brothers and
scientists have declared the pictures
to be the most remarkable ever taken
since the moving picture camera was
invented. It raiseB the question whe
ther there is anything left in the world
to be discovered, and unless human
ingenuity finds a means of getting to
the moon and the planets, all future
explorers will have to search out the
strange secrets of that part of the
earth submerged under the water.
There are many mysteries to be clear
ed up there and great and startling ad
ventures to be had, but the pioneers
in this newest and most fascinating
field are the Williamson brothers, who
for years have been working under
severe handicaps.^
These pictures have been endorsed
by teachers and superintendents of
public schools, heads of educational

The University of North Dakota
Glee club which will appear in Valley
City Wednesday, April 26, on its
eleventh annual tour of the state, is
one of the most popular student organi
zations at our state university. With
the exception of Willian Wellington
Norton, director of music at the uni
versity, the glee club is entirely a stu
dent organization. The management
is entirely in the hands of one of the
members, all trips and concerts are be
ing booked through him. It will be in
teresting to the public of Valley City
to know that two of the officers of this
most popular organization are products
of our own city and therefore if for
no other reason we should be interest
ed in their production. Their presi
dent is S. Cuyler Anderson, a former
High school boy and well known here
as a good musician and soloist. The
secretary of this club is one of our
popular boys at the university, Lloyd
Witter, son of Mr. and Mrs. W. L. Wit
ter, of this city.
The club has already taken one trip,
this year through the northern part oL
the state. The Easter trip is confined
to the southern part of the state and
includes Hillsboro, Fargo, Lisbon, Ei
lendale, Valley City, and Casselton.
Owing to the shortness of the vaca
tion the trip must be confined to one
week even though there are a number
of other towns which are desirous of
getting them for a concert.
On its tour the club carries 22 young
men, including Director Norton and
Howard Patmore, pianist. The entire
membership of the club is 36 men, and
places for the trip are made on a com
petitive basis, so that the 22 men that
go out are the "pick" of the organiza
tion. There is a great deal of rivalry
and spirit exhibited when it comes to
the tryouts, and it is this rivalry that
insures earnest work and the best re
sults.
The ensemble work of the North Da
kota club has always been the admira
tion of critics. This year, Director
Norton has arranged a program re
markable for its uniform excellence,
both from the standpoint of composi
tion, and wide range of subject matter.
It very frequently happens that a glee
club may do excellent work in a strong
attack and yet fail in its pianissimos.
The U. N. D. club has always had the
reputation of being a very flexible club
in the matter of voice giving. Most of
the young men have sung together
for from two to four years. This,
coupled with the absolute unity of the
club with Director Norton assures au
diences that hear this talented musical
group of a real musical treat.
Many New Students Are
Enrolled for New Term
The total enrollment at the Normal
school for the spring term has reached
535, which compares favorably with
that of the same term of other years.
Many students were prevented from
returning on schedule time on account
of flood conditions in different parts of
the state. It is expected that the en
rollment will exceed that of last year.
Twenty-four new students have en
rolled. Among these are John Rund,
Harriet Lakhorst, Lettie Canfield, Car
rie Thompson, Raymond Stillings,
Marie Northfoss, Anna Marler, James
Brady, Nellie Warner, Alma Fache,
Elma Houfstatter, Earl McKee, Frank
Tracy, Genevieve Connolly, Nora
Thorstenson, Helen Thompson, Joe
Underwood, Mary Bosworth, Marion.
Towne, Cora Forseth,- Ellen Holm.
Elizabeth Cassidy, Erwin Granger and
R. C. Johnson.
The work of the term was well start
ed at the end of the first week of
school and a fine spirit prevails.
