about three miles west of Hood River.
Chief Mark at once demanded satisfac

party or a satisfactory number of
ponies. Both demands were refused on
the ground of contributory negligence.

In tbe fall of 1860 Peter Neal visited
Hood River valley and decided to lo
cate on the abandoned Gordon place,
and in the spring of 1861 moved down
with his family, including his son-in-law,
Jerome Wincbell. If I remember
rightly, Hardin Corum came to Hood
river the same spring and built tbe saw

and tbe Neals made use of it, cutting
it wherever found, regardless of loca
tion. Uncle Sam then made no kick at
those who despoiled his forests. Neal's
lumber business was run very much on
Uncle Sam's protective tariff plan. We
paid $10 and $12 per 1000 for his lum-
L, Kara thnnah ha mould shin better
lumber to The Dalles and sell at $6 and
$8 per 1000 there. That is, we could
buy identically the same lumber at Tbe
Dalles, snd psy freight back to Hood
River as cheap as we could get it st
home; out mat was one vi untie
Pete's little ways, and we could buy it
or let it alone, just as we chose. Jesse
Neal. son of Peter Nesl, took up s
place adjoining tbe Butler place, which
was afterward purchased by John W.
Hinrichs, and a year or so later Corum
took a farm west of Jesse Neal's snd
built a saw mill on a branch of what Us
now known as Odell creek.
, 1 mnat nnt forffet to mention a well
known character of these early days,
known as George P. Roberts, later
Hog Roberts, tbe squaw man. I think
it must hsve been in tbe fall of 1857 or
the spring of 1858 that Roberta located
on tbe land wnere me wwn oi rr ana-
ton was afterwards laid out, and bunt
a aback on the little hill where the
Smith cemetery now is, and some years
later look up me piace on wnicu now i
the little town of Viento. Roberts was
then the most notorious liar easrof the
Cascades, and he bad no equals and no
superiors west of them. It was simply
impossioie ior tne man mj ten mis
truth, and no one expected it of him.
A sample yarn which afterwards be
came famous In tbe country, was told
me first by Roberts. Up to the fall of
'61 he had collected quite a band of
cayuse ponies. These, as tbe winter
came on, were driven onto the moun
tains east oi nood river, wnere tne
grass wss abundant and high. The
ensuing winter wss noted for it sever

According to his story he had spent

CANNING PLANT TO
DOUBLE ITS CAPACITY
Trumsn Butler, who left for Chicago
last week to arrange finances for tbe
Hood River Canning Co., wired from
that eity Tuesday that negotiations
km a . annoinded that would ensble
the esnnery to double its espacity. The
canning company has already com
pleted excavations for an addition to
I its building, and tbe new structure, it
is ststed, will ansa at once.

ia headed .by H. H. Larkina and E. B.

put of tbe cannery last year resched

Tbe consideration and adoption of
resolutions characterised tbe Monday
night meeting of me Commercial club.
The club members took measures to
offset a recent resolution adopted by
tbe Portland Chamber of Commerce,
whereby that body endorsed the action
of Portland lumber manufacturers. in
tbeir fight to secure from the Inter
state Commerce Commission a' parity
nf rataa tn Utah and intermountain
points with those from points east of
tbe Cascades.
In the resolution adopted by the local
club, Charles D. Mehaffey, a Portland
attorney, is asked to present the docu
ment to me interstate oommerca vum- '
mission on behalf of the organization.
Tbe resolution calls for a freight reduc
tion for all mills east of the Cascade
equal to any that may be granted to
tbe Portland mills.
Attention is called to the fairness of
sone rate basis tbat has formerly ex
isted, the topography of the country
east of the mountains as compared with
that on tbe west slope end the differ-.
ence in the quality of the lumber: J.
E. Robertson addressed the club mem-.
harm nn hehalf nf tha lumber interests.
stating that every mill man of the
Hood Kiver vaney, manuiacturing
much as 5,000 feet daily, as a member .
of tbe newly formed Hood River Lum
berman's Association. He declared
that if the Portland demands were
granted existing commercial relations
in the east Cascade districts would be
disrupted.
A communication from the Salem
Commercial club, which asked that the
local body endorse a resolution provid
ing for the publishing of elementary
text books for the state schools at
borne, was read. Prof. McLaughlin,
after a motion was made by W. L.
Clark, seconded by Leslie Butler and
Dr.Brosius, that the move be endotsed,
took tbe floor in opposition.
"1 believe in doing all we can at
hnmA " aaid Prof. McLaushlin. "but
the failure of California's attempt to
print its text books at home, shows the
inadequacies of our Pacific coast print
ers to handle matter of this kind. In
California the home published books
lowered the cost to the public very '
little, yet a very poor quality of work
was produced, both in text and in work- ..
manship. The buy at home movement.
In mtj nnininn can ha overdone, and ia
sometimes not the best economy. Very
few men on the Pacific coast really un-
derstand the business of text book
malrina "
' Dr. Brosius took the opposite view.
"Granted that the work may not be
quite as good," he aaid, -"as a matter
of policy I think we should print the
books at home. Having a little girl in
school 1 have recently become rejuven
ated. Personally I am disgusted with
the text books we have in use today.
Except for the individual efforts of
teachers I do not see such advancement
over the books used when 1 was in
school."
President Cruikshank also stated that
he considered some of the text books
as not equal to the old books.
While the vote oi me ciud memuera
conformed with a former action taken
by tbe board of directors and refused
to endorse tbe Salem request, it was
stated that the capital city's commer
cial body would send further detailed
information at tne request oi toe iocbi
club.
Leslie Butler expressed the opinion
that Oregon had men capable of issuing
as good text books as those produced in
tbe east, provided the matter were
placed in the hands of a capable com
mission and kept out of politics.
l anaa at atari at the cluh meeting
that Robert E. Smith, of Grants Pass,
of the Oregon Rational Tax Reform
League, would be in Hood River the
latter part of this week. Mr. Smith
will attend a meeting st the club rooms
tonight.
' Tha nlnh andnraad tha Chamberlain
Oregon-California Land Grant bill, now
before congress. A resolution was
adopted urging Oregon congressmen to
stand by tbeir guns and demand that 40
per cent of the fund from tbe great
area of grant lands be given to the
Oregon school funds. Another 40 per
cent will go to roads, while 20 per cent
Kill ha oisan tha general reclamation
fund. An effort has been made to
amend the Chamberlain bill, so that
only 20 per cent, instead of 40, will go
to the state school funds.
Oregon s representatives in congress
are all endeavoring to secure passage
of tbe Chamberlain bill as originally
introduced. Mr. McLaughlin read let
ters he had received from Congressmen
Hawley and McArthur. Congressman
Sinnott ia taking a vary active part in
the land grant legislation, having ap
peared before committee meetings, ap
pealing for tbe 40 per cent school fund.

have been drawn by Judge Derby.
Through a combined move on tbe part
ef tbe Commercial club, business men
of tbe city and the county court an
effort will be made to open tbe Colum
bia river highway in this county before
tbe apple trees of the valley have blos
somed. The work of tbe club at tbe
Monday night meeting waa piacea in
the bands of a committee composed of
Leslie Butler, E. W. Birge and W. L.
Clark. The club has suggested to the
county court that an engineer be sent
over tbe line of the road to secure
.n..;n..tinna nf tha amrk neceasarv for
clearing the road, and that the work
then be let to contractors. It was de
clared that too much delay will result
if supervisors of road districts through
which the highway passes are allowed
to complete the task. '
