LYNDEN, WASHINGTON, APRIL 13, 1916
Workingmen Will Not Fight a War For
By JAMES H. MAUSER. President Pennsylvania Federation of Labor
ISI'KAK not for organized labor, but for the working classes, aad
charge that the present call for arms was inspired by those who were
making immense profits selling ammunition and who at the close of
the European war would wunt a large army and navy to enforce the col
led inn of the money owed them by bankrupt nations.
The working people will not conseut to fight such a war. Instead
«>f spending more money I think congress had better investigate the
money already spent. The people have believed we were prepared. We
were told we were the greatest power on earth. LESS TIIVN TWO
YEAKS AGO WE WERE TOLD WE COULD BEAT QEHMANY
A\ I» MEXICO IT THE SAME TIME.
Now. suddenly we are told our boats are old tubs, our urmv helpless.
Theie were no rumors of war two years ago, when Germany and Austria
were in the best condition of their history.
IF I FELT NOW THAT THOSE DYING NATIONS COULD THRASH US
I WOULD BE ASHAMED TO ADMIT I WAS AN AMERICAN.
