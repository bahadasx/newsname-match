Tho boy nt the Mission seemed to

everything he said. Ho said that his
name was William Albert, that ho was
3 years old and that ho lived on a
bont with his father. What ho tried

Snlt Lake City, April 13. President
JoBQph F. Smith of tho Mormon
church, attacked present day dress of
women before several thousand men
and women at the Sunday school con
ference of tho church In the tabernacle
hero.
"I want to enter my protest against
the prevailing fashions for women," ho
said.
"I sco young women going down the
streets in garb not only ridiculous, but
shameful, suggestive and humiliating
to tho modesty of honorable men;
garbs that make lustful the low
scoundrels wbo nro willing to defile
anything that is sacred.
"To say that I am ashamed of such
fashions of dres3 Is speaking my mind
very mildly."
