CHAPTER IV.
Molly's Dizzy Popularity.
T HUS sped the evening, with
Molly climbing the dizzy heights
of popularity in hourly increas
ing excitement. Site not only
had a notable partner for every dance,
hut a brilliant partner for every tete
a-tete between numbers, and the al
most equally happy, though not so
highly favored. Fern warned lier, in a
giggling, whispered moment, to keep
lier back to the wall lest she be stab
bed. tier enp of happiness was full
when the famous musician, a near
sighted man who wore his hair short
and inspected her rapturously through
half inch thick glasses, composed a
sparkling little rondo for lier at a piano

in a quiet little alcove and named it
"Molly" and wrote it on her dance card,
all in the space of seven minutes.
True, he had danced with her two
numbers before and had had time to
think of her—possibly to think of her
in rondo terms.
— Occasionally she caught sight of
Sledge in the throng, although she had
not scon him on the floor, and she real
ized that her number with him would
be a "sit out." Perhaps that was why
it had been put down so far in the
program, when she would welcome a
rest. It was like his doing, for she
had to acknowledge that he was at
least farsighted.
One thing perplexed her. lie was
much less awkward and much more at
ease here than he had been at her
party. Whenever she saw him he was
talking gravely with men of large af
faii-s, and, to her surprise, she oliserv
ed that, in every ease, he was accorded
notable respect. Even the musician
seemed absorbedly interested in him.
and her leading millionaire came back
to him again aud again. She wonder
ed wiiy men sought him, and she was
still wondering when the eminent so
ciologist fairly snatched her out of the
arms of the mayor after the eighth
dance.
"Come and watch me smoke a ciga
rette," he begged her. "I've been try
ing to get a chance to talk with you
again the entire evening, but there's
always such an increasingly mad
scramble around you that the attempts
made me feel undignified."
"You'd worry a lot about that," she
guessed.
"Wouldn't I?" he laughed. "Will you
chill if we step out on the terrace?"
"I don't know how r ," she happily told
him, and they hurried outside, where
he led her to a seat in the moonlight
and deftly made her comfortable with
three cushions from as many chairs.
Sledge and Senator Allerton passed
them as he lighted his-cigarette, and
be looked after Sledge until the match
burned his fingers.
"There is the biggest mau I have
seen in a long while," be remarked as
lie sat beside her on the settee.
"They say he Is not only the boss of
the city, but of the state." replied Mol
ly, very much interested. "You knew
that, didn't you?"
"Of course," he acknowledged, "but
1 scarcely think that would influence
my judgment. I have studied a great
many men of more power and influence
than he has at present but none of
(hem, so far as I can recoilect, seemed
to have his elemental force. Wherever
■ . .
he was born, he would have been a
leader. He is a wonderful man. Throw
him in a savage couutry and he would
be king."
A litige figure approached them.
"Hello, Watt," rumbled the deep
voice of Sledge. "My dance, Molly."
"Well, you having a good time?".
asked Sledge, sitting comfortably In
the seat Mr. Watt had just vacated.
"The time of my life," she assured
him, with happy animation.
"That's the word," lie heartily ap
proved. "If there's anybody here you
want just tell Cameron. If he don't
trot 'em right over tell me."
"The mayor has been very kind." ac
knowledged Molly, be^nning to won
der.
"He's got his orders." returned
Sledge complacently. "Let me see
your dance program." and lie took it
from her lap. "I tbought so." he com
mented. "There's a dark horse turned
up, and you didn't get him."
"A dark horse?" she faltered.
"A ringer." he explained. "Lord
Bnnnchnse. Andrew Lepton, tiie big
coffee monopolist, sneaked him in hero
under an alias, and nobody's on." He
puzzled over the card « moment. "Ex
cuse me till I fix it." and he stalked
away.
Molly sat silently, allowing a cold
wave of humiliation slowly to chill lier
soul. Why. Sledge bad carefully pie
arranged her triumph of the evening.
He had assumed control of her dance
card and of her succession of delight
ful tete-a-tetes. He had driven the
star performers into her net as if they
had been droves of sheep. True, men
had sought her a second time of their
own accord because of that charm
which she knew she possessed—a
vaguely understood attractiveness,
which was more than beauty, more
than cleverness, more than mere sex
receptiveness. She had won by her
own power, but Sledge had given her
the glorious opportunities. His omnip
otence began to annoy her and his
mthlossness to inflame her already in
flamed resentment j
She knew precisely what was bap
pening at this moment He was creat
ing havoc in not less than half a dozen
dance cards, with no compunction
about having discommoded or dis
tressed any one. Theft there was Bert
downtown battling with a disaster
which had thrown him completely
from ills feet Poor Bert! She had by
no means forgotten him, even amid
the height of her excitement. She
should have been there to comfort him.
and yet—well, he had not seen fit to
come to her for comfort. Men were
queer creatures. A woman when dis
aster overtook her d'd not need to
deaden her ititelligenca She needed it
then more than ever.
After ail. though, Bert was a man.
and that was the way of men. and
there was no use to dream of overturn
ing tiie entire accepted order of crea
tion. She was certain, however, that
she could be of more help to Bert aft
er they were married. He was weak
er than she had thought
Very well; Sledge had thrown down
the gage of battle. He had laughed
when he was threatened and had ruin
ed Bert in challenging defiance. Let
him now take the consequences. If he
went to the penitentiary, well aud
good. He had probably sent other peo
ple there, with no more qualms of
mercy than she would now show to
him. She could be as ruthless as he.
What was it Professor Watt had call
ed the quality? Elemental force—that
was it. Well, she possessed it too.
She felt it within her. stirring with
the same physical nascency as the vi
rility of parenthood, to which it was
so closely allied.
Just off the governor's stuffed leath
er library was a small room, with a
hard desk and six hard chairs, and a
hard looking letter file, and a hard, fire
proof safe let into the wall, and here,
while Lord Bunnchiise led Molly Mar
ley through the paces of a hard two
step. Governor Waver and Senator Al
lerton and Sledge and Frank Marlcy
gathered for a few moments of com
fortnblc chat such as elderly gentle
men love to indulge in while frivo
lous younger people dance the flying
hours away. All four being gentle
ment who. by the consent of the pub
lie. bore the grave responsibility of
I he public welfare on their shoulders,
•t was not strange that their chat
should turn to public affairs.
"I am glad to be identified with the
enterprise." avowed State Senator A1
lerton. who was a snare, clean faced
gentleman, with a good > forehead and
a quite negotiable tongue. "At flic
same time, as far as I am privately
concerned, I can only regard it as *
temporary investment."
"Why temporary?" demanded Frank
Marlcy, who was feeling particularly
callable this evening. His $175.000
worth of street raHway slock lad been
Increased to $202,500. He was to have
$S7,500 cash out of the undivided sur
plus of the old company, and his daugh
ter. Molly, was the most popular girl
at the governor's ball. "The street rail
way company has always made money,
aud tiie city needs additional trans
portation facilities. We have reached
the normal period of extension, and 1
do not see what is to prevent us from
limitless prosperity."
"The franchises," Senator Allertou re
minded him. "Your present permits
have less than five years to run."
"I have never had any trouble in har
ing them renewed," objected Marlcy,
priding himself on his management.
"Times are changing." sighed Allcr
ton. "There is a growing disposition
on the part of the public to charge pub
lic service corporations for the use of
public property."
"The people are ungrateful." mourn
ed Governor Waver, who had enriched
himself through furnishing electric
light at his own price to a public
which had known nothing better than
gas. "The moment they see a profit
on tneir luxuries they want part of it
An undivided surplus such as the street
car company has had is a constant
menace."
That was a sinking fund for exten
sions and improvements," Marley re
minded him. "The stockholders had
no right to ask for a division of it."
"They would if we had not put it out
of harm s road." insisted the governor.
"That much has been saved to the
men who really earned it, but 1 should
not like to see a similar profit exposed.
To my mind, a 7 per cent dividend la
an even worse folly."
"It gives confidence in the stock,"
argued Marley. "The public would
never be so eager to take up this new
issue if it had not been for that 7 per
cent dividend."
That s what it was for," interpo
lated Sledge, looking out of the win
dow into the sunken garden and vain
ly hunting the hand hole in the gate.
It has served its purpose," granted
Allerton. "but taxpayers are becoming
greedy. When they see the stockhold
ers of a public corporation makiug 7
per cent they want some of it and try
to make the corporations pay part of
their taxes. In every city of impor
tance the voters are demanding pay
for street car franchises and making
the street railway companies, in addi
tion. bear half the cost of all street
improvements."
"It's a bad outlook," agreed Gover
nor Waver. "Frankly, as soon as I
receive my new issue of stock I shall
have it quietly placed on sale."
Marley looked at him indignantly.
"Why, the street railway company is
entering on the greatest period of
prosperity in its career," he asserted.
"There'll be no trouble about fran
chises. The city is wild to have the
Improvements and must have them."
Allerton looked at him wonderingly.
"Waver is right," he stated. "I shall
sell my own stock, and I'll venture to
say that Sledge has already made si
lent arrangements for disposing of his.
Do you know that the franchises at
present granted in this state are rev
ocable and that it is not possible to
secure one which is positively safe for
longer than ten year periods? When
you come to the renewal of your fran
chises, Marley, you will be met with
a demand for pay aud will have other
restrictions imposed on you. Our pres
ent franchise law, in view r of the pub
lic tendency, is a bad one for in
vestors."
"Let's fix it." suggested Sledge.
"I'm afraid it's too late." protested
Allerton
"Not for a new gag," dissented
Sledge. "A new one can be put over
quick."
"I fancy^that there should be protec
tion somewhere," opined the governor.
"No matter what changes in public
sentiment, the investing class, upon
which the public depends for prosper
ity, must always be protected."
"But how?" inquired the senator.
"How in this particular case?"
"Head 'em off," grunted Sledge.
"I'm keeping my stock."
"I'd be glad to hold mine," stated the
senator. "But how is it to he made of
future value?"
"That's up to you." Sledge replied,
rising. "Figure it out and see me to
morrow. Marley, I want to talk to
you."
Mr. Marley, today a man worth over
a third of a million dollars in the street
railway stock alone, arose in offended
dignity. He was a trifle too impor
tant, too capable and too wealthy to
be ordered about like a messenger boy
by a mau who might shortly he a con
victed criminal. Molly had arranged
an interview between her father and
Bert on the previous afternoon, and
Mr. Marley also now knew a thing or
two.
"I would suggest tomorrow," he stat
ed coldly. "I should much prefer to
talk with you during business hours."
"This ain't business." said Sledge,
leading the way into the library, where
he took a seat in an alcove.
Marley followed him reluctantly.
"If it is my family affairs"— he be
gan in protest.
"Sit down," directed Sledge. "Bert
Glider lias been making threats against
me."
"Has he?" inquired Marley noncom
mittally.
"Tell him to quit or make good." or
dered Sledge.
"Really, Mr. Sledge. I don't see where
I can interfere." reproved Mr. Marley.
"The matter is entirely between you
and Rort."
"He's a friend of yours." charged
Sledge.
"Yes," acknowledged Marley. feeling
that he could afford to acknowledge It
now that the street car reorganization
had gone beyond the point where
Sledge could stop it
"How about this marriage with
Molly?"
"That's Molly's affair," stated Mar
ley stiffly.
"You know he's broke, don't you?"
"I heard something of the sort," ad
mitted Marley. "He's a clever young
mau, however, and until he gets on his
feet again I have money enough for
both."
"Y'ou won't stop it, then?"
"Certainly not." declared Marley,
feeling that he might just as well make
capital for courage out of the fact that
he could not in the slightest degree in
fluence Molly. "I might, perhaps, pre
fer a more brilliant match for Molly,
but I do not need to make it a matter
of money, and there is no better fam
ily in America than Bert's. The Mary
land Gliders are the oldest and best
stock in this country. Moreover, above
all things. I wish to see my daughter
happy."
"So do I," asserted Sledge. "That's
why she can't marry this pinhead,
want her myself."
"Molly lias made her choice," declar
ed her father firmly.
"So you lay down, eh?"
"I decline to Interfere."
"Making Bert a bum cuts no ice?"
"His temporary financial condition
has no bearing in the matter. I should
feel humiliated to think that I had al
lowed that trifling consideration to be
a factor."
"Huh!" grunted Sledge. "You got
enough for both, eh?"
"Quite enough," and Marley reflect
ed, with a pleasant feeling of superiori
ty, upon the moment soon to come
when this political and commercial
lmlly would be cringing.
"Then watch out for your eye,"
warned Sledge and. rising, walked out
into the drawing rooms.
He found Molly quite busy, but, since
she was only occupied with a state
representative and a local millionaire
and the mayor and the young cham
pion of the tennis players' club, he bor
rowed her.

"Sure," grunted Sledge. *
break him too."
m goana
She was astounded to see how they
melted before him and almost had a
feeling of wildly clutching at the coat
tails of the mayor, whom she heartily
disliked.
"I'm sorry for you, Molly," Sledge
told her as he pre-empted the piano
alcove. "I got to hand you another
jolL"
"You're a fast worker," she compli
mented him. "But you'll have to work
faster. I just gave Willie Walters a
hint of the splendid news we are to
have for the Blade, aud he is tickled
to death."
"Good work!" applauded Sledge. "1
want that pulled quick."
Molly smiled.
"All right Go as far as you like,"
she confidently Invited him. "We'll
see who gets the worst of it By the
way, maybe you wouldn't mind telling
me the new jolt I am to receive."
Sledge chuckled.
"Your dad says he don't care if Bert
is a bum."
"He isn't!" she hotly denied.
"Your dad's.a game sport He says
he has enough money for both."
"Good for daddy!" she cried, de
lighted.
"Sure!" grunted Sledge. "I'm goana
break him too."
CHAPTER V.
Sledg* Reduces Hie Salary List.
S LEDGE walked back through
the Occident in such a mood
that the regular members of
the "Good morning, Ben," bri
gade fell away from him like bar flies
from a cake of ice. Even Doc Turner,
waiting the daily advent of the boss,
met with the rebuff of stony silence
and sat down in his favorite newspa
per corner, with his crusted brown der
by jammed down to his ears and his
Inch long stub of cigar puckered tight
ly in at the corner of his wrinkled
lips, where it looked at a distance like
n speck of black rot in a dusty potato.
Doc had digested, condensed and pur
veyed news to the big chief so long
that he felt a proprietorship in that de
partment and was justly offended
when Tom Bendix came in a few min
utes later.
"What's the matter with Sledge this
morning?" snarled Doc.
"How do I know?" immediately
snarled Bendix. "I don't sleep with
him."
"He's got a grouch on him a foot
thick," complained Doc. "He gave me
a cold turndown. Walked straight
through me without even a grunt."
"I'll tell Sledge he'd better be care
ful," sarcastically commented Bendix.
"Weil, Kelly, what do you want?"
Schoouer Kelly, who was afflicted
with pink whiskers and a perennial
thirst, stopped scratching.
"Two bits," he stated, with admira
ble clarity. "What's the matter with
Big Ben?"
"He's teething," replied Bendix, pro
ducing the desired two bits, without
which Schooner Kelly would be a nui
sance for hours to come.
A low browed thug, with a long and
aide scar sunk in one cheek, drew
Bendix mysteriously aside.
"The Dutchman down in the Eighth
ward has rented his back room to the
Hazelnut club," he stated.
"Well?" inquired Bendix.
"Well, the Hazelnut club has Charley
Atwood for its president, and Charley
is a brother-in-law of Purcell."
"I see," said Bendix. "1 suppose
Dutch Klein knew this?"
"The Cameron picture's down off his
back bar."
"Tell him you told me." advised
Bendix, weighing the matter carefully,
for of such trifles was political control
constructed.
"Is that the worst news I can carry?"
demanded the other, disappointed.
"If there's any worse we'll send it
out when the wagon backs up," re
sponded Bendix dryly.
"All right, captain," agreed the tale
bearer. "Say, can you slip me an
ace?"
Bendix slipped him an nee from *
fund provided for that purpose.
"Thanks," said the thug. "Say,
what's the matter with Sledge?"
"None of your business!" snapped
Bendix, with a wondering glance i»t
the back room, and he waded through
the usual morning lineup with that
wonder growing on him. The action*
aud bearing of Sledge varied by so
thin a hair's breadth from day to day
that a notable variation meant some
thiiur.

Aagora Rabbits.
The loug haired Angora rabbit is a
native of Asia Minor. Its name Is de
rived from the province of Angora,
where almost all tiie animals of what
ever species have Tong fine silky hair.
Over a hundred years ago the l>eauty
of the Angora rabbit attracted atten
tion. and it was introduced to Europe.
The peasants of Switzerland, Savoy
and Flanders have long bred the ani
mal, and in those countries Angora
rabbits are a source of considerable
profit. Soft furry "Angora" caps and
mittens and other articles of clothing
are knit from yarn spun from the half
of tiie Angora rabbit Tiie hair is not
sheared periodically, like the fleece of
sheep, but is combed off every few
months. In the course of a year some
three-quarters of a pound of hair la
obtained from a single animal.
Labor.
Labor is the contest of the life of
man with an opposite. Literally It Is
the quantity or lapse, loss or failure of
human life, caused by any effort It
Is usually confused with effort itself
or the application of power, but there
Is much effort which is merely a mode
of recreation or of pleasure. The most
beautiful actions of the human body
and the highest results of the human
intelligence are conditions or achieve
ments of quite unlaborious -nay, of
recreative—effort. It is the negative
quantity—or quantity of defeat—
which has to lie counted against ev
ery feat and of defect which has to
he counted against every fact or deed
of men. In brief, it Is "that quantity
of our toil which we die In."—John
