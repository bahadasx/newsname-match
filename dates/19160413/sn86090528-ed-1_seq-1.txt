El Paso, Tex., April 13. Array offi
cers here say the critical stago pf the
punitive expedition Ih at hand. They
point out the insufficiency of supplies,
the long line of communications and
inadequate transportation service as
tho greatest dangers. It is privately
admitted that' Col. Dodd's men went
hungry for ways.
By United Tress.
Washington, April 13 "it 1m already
time to treat with the United States
for tho withdrawal of their forces
from our territory."
The above language Is part Of a
communication from Carraiiu'i sec
retary of state to Secretary Lansing,
tho unofficial text of which has been
received by officials here.
As a result of the demand thus
voiced, it is believed that the United
States government Is facing the most
serious kind of a situation. '
In a note which is reported to be en
routo here Carrauza declares that the
de facto government never formerly
consented to the American troops
crossing the border and also states
that "the Mexican government judges
It convenient to suspend for the pies
eiit all discussions of negotiations In
this particular."
The note declares that the United
States soldiers are on Mexican soil
without permission, that they were al
lowed, to unUir while an agreement
with .Mexico was being completed and
now Carranza refuses to complete the
agreement, suggesting that the time
has come for reaching terms relative
to the withdrawal of the troops and
tho assumption by the Carramststas of
the task of catching Villa.
Klisso Arredomla, the Mexican am
bassador here, declined to discuss the
note. It was stated at the embassy,
however, thut tin official text nf tha
communication was being iransiateu
and would bo taken immeiately to
tho state department when completed.
Secretary Lansing, not having receiv
ed the note, declined to predict what
the American attitude would be.
No ultimatum or demand is contain
pd in Carranza's note, which has not
yet been delivered to the tttalo depart
ment, the embassy stated at noon,
Kather it contains a request for nego
tiations looking to the withdrawal of
the troops and assumption of the pur
suit Of .Villa by the ( arraiuistas.
Tho president abandoned his pro
posed trip to New York for a speech
ctnriliiv Hich officials hinted that It
was doubtful whether the government,
would comply with t request of Car
ranza. l!y some the text of the Carranza
note it is taken to indicate that I ar
ranza may simply be bluffing for mor
al effect on tho Mexicans and to ad
on,... the nroMige of the do iuci.o
i Thn negotiations will

oner got busy in an effort to have him
released from custody and an agree
ment was reached whereby it is alleg
ed the city authorities have stated
they will release Churchill upon pay
ment of $."0 of the $10i fine, provided
Churchill will sign a pledge to abstain
from the tise of intoxicating liquors as
long as he remains in Chickasha.
At noon today it was alleged $30 of
the necessary $,',0 had been raised and
tho county and city officers have
agreed to wait until tomorrow morning
on those who are in charge of raising
tho fiiTO.
In the room where Woodson died but
there were no indications that he had
