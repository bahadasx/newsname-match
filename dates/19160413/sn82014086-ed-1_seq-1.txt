LYMAN'S SAFE DEPOSJT BOX
The Germans northwest of Verdun
evidently are holding in leash their
infantry for fresh attacks in their en
deavors to capture Hill 304 ani Le
Mort Homme, keypoints which are
tenaciously barring their way to the
fortress.
The infantry has remained idle in
their trenches while the big guns are
showering shells on the region em
bracing the triangle formed by Hill
304, Esnes and Le Mort Homms. Not
even a sally by the Germans in this
district is reported in the latest French
official communication.
Comparative quiet prevails east of
the .Meuse around Douaumont and
Vaux, where there has recently been
such vicious fighting.
No infantry attacks have been made
by either side and the activity of the
artillery has been less marked than
on previous days.
Mining operations and grenade
fighting have taken place in the Ar
gonne forest, during which the French
captured the southern edge of two
craters near Les Courtes Chausseus.
The Germans along the Fi'.kelm
Ypres road after three attacks invaded
British trenches but were quickly ex
pelled from them, while the British
successfully raided German trendies
near Richebourg l'Avoue. The Brit
ish official communication says the
Canadians in their gallant fightin-
during the past week have innicted
heavy losses on the Germans near St.
Eloi.
In the Russian theatre thero have
been artillery duels and infantry at
tacks at various places. On tho Aus
tro-Italian front the Italians have
taken from the Austrians the heights
north of Rioponale and strong lines
of trenches and redoubts on the south
ern slopes of Monte Pari and Cinna-
doro and on the rocks of Monte
Sperne, the Austrians suffering heavy
casualties. Elsewhere along the line
the artillery duels continue.
Despatches from Saloniki report a
recrudescence of artillery fighting on
the Greek front between Grieveli and
Doiran. In Asiatic Turkey, Petrogxad
reports a continuance of the Russian
advance west of Erzerum. The Turks,
however, in the region of Bitlis took
the offensive against the invaders but
all their attacks were repulsed.
Although the Turks report a seri
ous defeat near Falahie of the British
advancing to the relief of General
Townshend's force beleaguered in
Kut-el-Amara, a despatch is said to
have been received in South Africa
from General Townshend saying that
he was well and expecting relief
shortly.

VERBAL ATTACK MADE
ON SECRETARY DANIELS ,
At Annual Convention of Navy League
of the United States.
Washington, April 12. Sessions ol
he annual convention . of the Navy
League of the United States were fea
tured today by attacks on Secretary
Daniels because of his refusal to per
mit Rear Admiral Bradley A. Fisk to
read a paper at the convention and a
denunciation of the Hay army bill by
S. Stanwood Menken, president of the
National Security League. Robert M.
Thompson, president of the Navy
League, called the navy department's
policy narrow and assailed the secre
tary for what he termed a suppression
of free speech. Henry Reuterdahl de
clared the departments attitude was
but a reflection of the attitude of the
White House and said that "every ad
ministration must have its Dreyfus."
Mr. Menken characterized the Hay
bill as a menace to the country and as
a. violation of every recommendation
of experts. He charged that congress
was ignoring a demand for defense
on lines laid down by men who knew.
He said the American people had
shown themselves for preparedness
and that congress should know "that
their delays are intolerable and that
if we are attacked theirs will be the
penalty for the wreck and ruin of our
country."
The Navy League received a tele
gram today from a Chicago newspa
per offering to donate to the league
money it received from an anti-pre
paredness advertisement inserted ear
ly in the week by Henry Ford. The
league accepted the donation and alto
telegraphed Mr. Ford, thanking him
for the contribution.

house district i:i this city wa.s the
scene of the worst fire in four years,
when the plant of the Dodd Coc-age
Company on State street was wiped
out with a total loss of $23,000. The
plant is adjacent to the New Haven
road tracks and a spark from a pass
ing engine is believed to be the origin
of the fire. One of the hydrants was
so filled with stones and gravel hat
the fire department was handicapped
for nearly half an ho-ir getting water
from that hydrant. The fire was dis
covered when the place was a raging
furnace. . The alarm was rung at 8:20
o'clock and the department had to re
main on the scene all night. North
bound trains were held up for an hour
because of the proximity of the fire
to the tracks. The cooperage com
pany had it splant stocked with lumber

Note Denies That Sussex Was Attack

Responsibility for Sinking of Other
Ships.

to the inquiries of the American gov

sex, Manchester Engineer. English
man, Berwindvale and Eagle Point,
signed by Gottlieb von Ji','ow, the
German minister of foreign affairs,
has been forwarded to Washington by
Ambassador Gerard.
Sussex Not Attacked by German Sub
marine.
The note denies that the Sussex was
attacked by a German submarine. The
investigation covering the Sussex casv.
says the note, was extended to all ac
tions undertaken on March 24 the
day of the Sussex incident In the
channel between Folkestone and Dirp-
pe. one steamer was sunk, thi com
mander of the German submarine
reaching the definite conclusion that
it was a war vessel. A sketch of this
vessel, together with photographic re
productions of a picture of the Sussex
jada, which has its connection by the printed in the London Dally Graphic
Mexican Northern railroad. On their
way to Sierra Mojada they sacked the
small town of Corillo.
Believe Villa May Be Directing.
The belief that Villa himseif mav be
directing the operations of the bandits
is supported by a report received to
day from Ojinaga stating that Colonel
Kiojas, the commander there, had in
formation that VU.a had doubled in
his tracks and was 200 miles south
west of that town.
Ojinaga is directly across the border
from Presidio, Tex., and about 150
nines north of Sierra Majada.
Another circumstance that gives
color to this location of the bandit
chief is the fact that Canuto lteyes,
at the head of a large number of men.
was reported from Torreon a week ago
to be traveling north in the direction
of Sierra Mojada. It was the belief
at the time in Torreon that Villa's ally
was on his way to join his chief. If it
proves true. Villa has evaded the
American troops who have been driv
ing south at an amazing speed and are
tooay reported, from the reliable
sources, to be well south of Parral. and
close to the Durango border.
Sierra Mojada is 140 miles east of
tne nearest point at which American
troops are known to be.
