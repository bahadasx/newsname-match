MR, COOKE iND PRTY COMING l
TO DECIDE UPON PAPER Ml
practically\ Agr ( 11) o11
And()fficial .Action Will
Be Taken Here Early Inl
)May.
At a meeting to be held in this t
1ty during the week of May 1st will
Sdecided whether Bogalusa is to get
bother big industry, and indica
a are that the mill will be built
nd in operation before the end of
he present year. t
Announcement is made today
hat Walter P. Cooke. president of
te Great Southern Lumber Compa
ay, accompanied by a number of1
the directors, will arrive in Bogalu
son Thursday, May 4th, when it
willbe decided whether the paper
ill will be built or not.
Mayor Sullivan leaves one week
fom today for Northern points
where he goes to collect further in
fotnation regarding the building of
the mill. Already the Great South
pr has spent thousands of dollars
i investigating the feasibality of
ecting a paper mill, as well as
deciding upon how to utilize Dart
dthe great waste at the mill.
Therefore it is safe to predict that
when the directors meet here the
ist of next month they will decide
derect the plant.
While no figures are given out,
fit thought though that the mill will
cost in the neighborhood of a million
dollars and give employment to at
least200 men. The fact that the
mill will be erected by the Great
Southern means that no time will
e lost in making the start and
tuhing the work to an early com
letion. The mill will be located
U Columbia Street.
With the lumber mill working
the greatest number of men in the
history of the organization, with
the paper mill running day and
night with the shops working a
hWge force of men and with indica
tios for a new paper mill, the
the doubling of the capacity of the
present mill and the voting of a
bond issue of $200,000 and the vast
extensions and improvements it
begins to look like Bogalusa is going
to have to force men to work over
time and that the most prosperous
year in the history of the city
awaits us.
There will be at least 100 families
come to Bogalusa this year to make i
their home if houses can he secured.
Some one with a little money and
alot of hustle can easily organize
acompany to erect houses that
could care for the people who want
tocome to Bogalusa.

LOCALS MAKE PELICANS
PLAY HEAL BASEBALL
Condition of .Men Showsj
Btogalusa to Have Best
Team in City's History
The Pelicans, pennant winners of
the Southern League were given
the best practice game of the season
when they came to Bogalusa Sunday
for a game with the locals. Had
the Bogalusa boys had the team
work and base running down as
well as the champions, the result
of the game might have been
different. As it was, the score
resulted in the visitors scoring six
runs to the locals three. Benton, -
Walker and Higgins were the battery
for the Pelicans while Irven, Verret
and Stapleton represented the
Bogalusa team. Irvin proved to be
superior in his work to the Pelican
I pitchers and he succeeded in striking
out a number of the professionals,.
Verret pitched less than two innings
and did good work after he settled
down. Every member of the local
team played a fine game. The stick
work of the locals was better than
that of the visitors. The feature
play of the game was the play of
Bennet Boyd who made a double
by throwing from center field to
first base. The work of Riley, of
the Bogalusa team was exceptional- I
ly fine, but several members of the
team played equally as good ball.
The work of the locals showed
conclusively that Bogalusa fans
can expect the team this year to
be the best in the history of the city
This is the second game they have
played this season, and they played
the game like seasoned men.
Miss Byrd Arrives
e Mr. and Mrs. J. M. Byrd, formerly 1
of this city but now located at Col
t umbia are the proud parents of a
daughter which arrived Wednesday,
weighing nine pounds. Mother and
r child doing well and MIr. Byrd feels
happier than if he had been elected
I Assessor.
Engagements Announced
The engagement of Ed Dreyfus,
e of Dreyfus Co., and one of Bogalusa
Sbest known business men, to Miss
tCarrie Wolff, a charming young
lady of Washington La., has been
announced. The wedding will take
place in the early summer.
Into New Homes
Mr. and Mrs. W. B. Archer have
t moved into the house formerly oc
t cupied by Mrs. Emma Friend. Mr.
Ui and Mrs. Frank Rowell and Mr. and
t Mrs. G. A. Townsend have moved
0into their new bungalows which
i were completed a few days ago.
r Fence On Fourth Street
t The Great Southern Lumber
s Company is building a fence along
d Fourth Street, at the mill property.
h This is being done so that all teams
ei oing on the plant to haul away
lumber for local use will have to go
f through one gate so the lumber can
) be checked.
S Columbians Coming
The Columbians, a fast ball team
from New Orleans will play here
next Sunday. They expect to de
. feat the locals in an easy manner,
.ibut the Bogalusa fans know how
the game will end.
Mayor's Heart to Heart
Talk to The Voters
"I want every one in Bogalusa to know that W. H.
Sullivan is lined up for Col. Pleasant. Now,.I want to
give you a heart to heart talk. This city is made up of
men 95 per cent of whom are Southerners. We keep a
careful analysis of the men employed at other factories
in the city of Bogalusa and 90 per cent of these are either
citizens of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi or our great state
ot Louisiana, so that whenever it is said that Bogalusa is
a Northern city, or a Yankee City, we certainly ought to
resent it. â€¢ (I am Canadian and Irish too) (Laughter and
applause.) Now, during this campaign it has gone around
through certain sections of the state, that Bogalusa is a
Yankee City and is going to fight any opposition to the
progressive party and not support the Democratic ticket.
Now I want you my friends, if you feel that I am sincere,
and if you feel that I have done anything to deserve your
good will and friendship in building up the city of Boga
lusa, I want you to assist me, if you believe I am sincere
in what I say, by assisting me to get out a large, strong
vote for Col. Pleasant on election day."
NECESSITY. OF PUBLIC DIPPING VATS
FOR ALL SECTIONS OF THE PARISH
The importance of tick eradica- s
tion for Washington Parish is best 1
;hown by some correspondence
published below between the Lamp- t
ton Realty Co., one of the greatest t
:attle raisers of the south, and an a
official at Baton Rouge. At the
last meeting of the police jury, steps i
were taken to build dipping vats in 1
the Parish.
Magnolia, Miss., April 4th, 1916
Mr. W. H. Sullivan.
Bogalusa, La.
Dear Sir:
In order to show you just how
Washington Parish has become
"Bottled up" in the handling of cat
tie, we hand you herewith a letter
from Dr. Flowers, of Baton Rouge,
La., together with a copy of our
reply. You will remember the six
ty head of cattle (native cows) that
we had for sale. These cows were
sold by us to a party in East Car
roll Parish, La., which parish the
quarantine regulations have been
removed. After taking the matter
up with Dr. Flowers over the phone,
we found that we could not ship
these cattle from Washington Par
ish to East Carroll, but Dr. Flowers
stated that we could get the cattle
into Pike or Walthall, which coun
ties are in course of eradication
that by following the instructions!
as outlined in his letter we could
then make shipment, but you can
clearly see this would be practically
prohibitive.
The Poli-e Jury seems to be in
terested in the building of vats and
thought possibly you might get your
local paper to publish something
along the line of tick eradication,
using the inclosed letters if you,
wish.
The state of Mississipni has en
acted a law effective January 1st
1917, compelling every county in
the state to eradicate the ticks so
you see if Washington Parish does
not get busy, the time will come
when the only place we will be able
to ship will be the butcher pen, and
we know that you as well as our
selves do not care to sell some of i
the fine cattle we are raising in this
way.
Appreciating your interest,
we beg to remain,
Yours very truly,
Robert B. Lampton.
Magnolia, Miss., April 5th, 1916.
E. Pegram Flowers,
Sec'y and Ex-Officer,
Baton Rouge, La,
Dear Sir"
We thank you for your letter
ot the 3rd, and beg to say after
talking to you over the phone, de
cided it would be practically pro
hibitive for us to ship cattle to East
Carroll Parish, and we therefore
sold a car of these cattle to go into
t Tangipahoa Parish. La., and believe
we will be able to sell the balance
to go into Hinds county, Miss., there
t being a quarantine station at Jack
1 SOD.
We would like to know from you
who the party was that was trying t
1to ship the bulls from Washington
Parish. We believe Brockdale,
Quite a good deal of interest has
been created in Washington Parish,
leading toward tick eradication, and
we, would like very much for you
to give us some assistance along
this line if possible.
e Yours very truly,
Secretary.
r Suppose you have noticed where
Mississippi has passed state wide
r tick eradication, effective, January
1st, 1917.
Baton Rouge, La., April 3rd, 1916.
e Mr. R. B. Lampton,
Magnolia, Miss,
Dear Sir:
Referring to our telephone i
communication of even date, rela
tive to the shipment of cattle from
Washington Parish, to East Carroll
Parish, this state which latter sec
tion has been released from quaran.
tine or, in other words, tick free,
beg to advise that the only proce
dure. whereby this cattle may be
feasibly shipped at this time, is as
follows:
followThese cattle could be dipped
twice in Pike county, Miss., within
a period of ten days and after last
- dipping: accompanied by a federal
d certificate from the inspector in
ir charge of Pike county, and loaded
g in a disenfected car. If these ar
1 rangements could he made this is
u, permit to ship same without the
necessity of a tuberculin test, inas
i- much as such cattle originate in
st the state of Louisiana. As there
n is no systematic tick eradication
;o going on in Washington Parish, this
s is the only arrangement that could
e be made whereby these cattle could
le be shipped to East Carroll.
Id Very truly yours,
r- E. Pegriam Flower,

MOST FUN OF YOUR LIFE at
AT THE SIG MINSTRELS he
The date is announced as Tues- T
day evening April 25 for the great o
minstrel show, known as "Hal G.
Feels." which will be given at the
Y. M. C. A. and it is needless to
state that the event promises to
attract the largest crowd for such
an event in the history of Bogalusa.
H. L. Porter has been out in the
Cut Over Pine lands for the past
two weeks working on his part and
at a dress rehearsel held last night, s
he proved to be as good a black a
face comedian as a land salesman- i
and that's going some. n
H. E. Hoppen will be one of the v
end men. He has a joke ready to ii
"crack" on most every man in P
e Bogalusa. Not old ones either.
Real fresh ones that will cause i
d everyone, except the man it is told ii
on, to get a laugh a minute. Then o
SC. O. Johnson is going to tell a few e
good ones after Mr. Hoppen runs a
short. Mr. Johnson is not giving I
Sany of his jokes out, but he prom- I
ises that he will have some surprises c
in store and expects to show Mr. t
Hoppen up as a good "joke cracker" c
even if the popular secretary is r
an old hand at the business. r
e There will be old time melodies C
and popular songs, a vaudeville act I
s that will cause Martin Beck, of the f
d Orpheum to run up here and take a
d "once over." The olio will be I
entitled "Political Memories" and
the boys absolutely deny that it will
be any farce on the coming elec-I
tion, and that no local politicans
will be impersonated. It is hinted
however, that this is the wrong in
formation as it has leaked out that
the characters in the act are all
r well known local politicans. Any
s way you will never laugh as much
al in your life as you do at this mins
n. trel. Announcement of the seat sale
- will be published in next weeks

e On Sunday evening J. W. Ezell
was married to Miss Mary Case by
Judge C. E. Ott. Both are well
of(known residents of Bogalusa and
is I their many friends will be pleased
er to know that they will make their
I future home here.
.lust As Soon As The Ques
tions Can Be Discussed
And Given Plenty Of
Publicity.
Now that the question of Sunday
baseball has been settled, the
election of Col Pleasant practically
agreed upon, the question of enforc
ing ordinance number 37 or ammend
ing it so as to Permit picture shows
run on Sunday and the closing of
stores will be disposed of next.
Following the action of the coun
cil to enforce the ordinance the
Magic City theater was closed on
Sunday and likewise a number of
stores and other places of business
which heretofore have operated
part of the Sabbath. Part of the
merchants and citizens are divided
I on closing of all stores on Sunday
but over 800 signed a petition to
the Mavor and the Council asking
for a Mass Meeting to be held when
the question of permitting the
motion picture houses to operate
would be discussed. It has been
decided to hold the Mass meeting at
the Y. M. C. A., in the near future
when every citizen of Bogalusa
will be invited to be present
and state their views in the matter.
The question then will most likely
be taken to a vote and if the major
itys favor the ammending of the
ordinance so as to let the picture
shows operate on Sunday it will be
so ammended, if not ordinance 37
will be enforced to a letter.
Every merchant on Columbia
street is in favor of Sunday base
hall and picture shows and a ma
jority favor the stores to be oper
ated in the future as in the past
Three columns ot interviews were
t obtained from these merchants this
week, but owing to lack of space
e they could not be published.
