County Agent Harwell was in
Santa Fe Monday, where be inter
viewed thestate engineer, as a re
sult of which two state oflicialsare
to come here and in conjunction
with a man from the state col
lege make pumping tests of wells
in tne county, ana analyses or
the water. In order to get this
done it waa necessary to agree
that the expanses of the men
while in the county would be
borne locally. It is thought the
work will consume two or three
weeks. UDon Mr. Harwell's re
turn from Santa Fe a few Estan
cia men were hastily got togeth
er, who agreed that the proposed
work is very important and that
this locality will bear its share of
the expenses with great cheer
fulness. The few present
nledired $42.50. with the under
standing that the subscriptions
would be increased by others,
the necessary amount being pro
rated among the subscribers. An
official report as to the capabili
ties of some of the wells of the
county, together with an official
reDort as to the quality of the
waters, will be worth a great
deal to the county, particularly
in view of some statements that
have been made.

Geo. P. Leaxnard Piano Co.
Sell Pianos Player Pianos
Are You Interested?
Since the year 1900 Geo. P.
Learnard has been established in
the piano business in .Albuquer
que, and since that date has sold
more pianos to the people ot
New Mexico than any other per
son in the state.
January 1, 1914, Mr. Learnard
conceived the idea that pianos
could be sold on a more satisfac
tory basis to both the purchaser
and himself by eliminating the
big items of store rent, partner
ship affairs, clerk hire and other
incidental expenses. Since that
date every piano purchaser has
shared in the saving of expenses.
A'l pianos are shipped direct from
the factory to purchaser, and Mr.
Learnard, accompanied by Mr.
Leen R. Allen, Piano Tuner, now
travels overland continually and
calls personally on anyone who
desires information about pianos
and players, and especially those
who may be, desirous of learning
about his new and successful
selling plans.
When you t ecome interested in
purchasing a piano write to Mr.
Geo. P. Learnard personally and
you will receive a prompt reply
and the satisfaction that you
desire when you place your
hard earned dollars in the pur
chase of a piano for your home
and little ones. Mail this today.
Mark a x below opposite that
in which you are intrested.
