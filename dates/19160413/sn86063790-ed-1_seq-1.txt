Tomato Culture. T
* v P
The culture of tomatoes is com- p
paratively simple. The land is plow- f<
r. ed and harrowed the same as for r;
corn. Lay off rows four feet apart, v
and apply fertilizer in drill. As it is
impossible now to get a fertilizer containing
more than 1 or 2 per cent, of
--? - .? i * - ?i? ?fl
potasn, save an me asnes yuu can get ?
and use as a top dressing after the
\ plants are 6et out. Lime is also
* good, but neither ashes nor lime
, should be mixed with stable manure, F
as the ammonia in the latter is set d
free and so lost. Apply them at different
times. For the girls' tenth- ^
. acre plat, we advise 50 pound acid
acre plat, we advise 50 pounds acid ^
meal, and it is a good plan to use n
half of this wheu the plants are set k
out. and to apply the rest after they s<
are growing well. Stable manure t]
tends to cause black rot, a fungus
growth that attacks the "blossom end ^
of the tomato. This, however, can t(
i be controlled by spraying with Bor- a
deaux mixture, the formula for which a
we give the girls, so they can mix
a small quantity at a time. Plants ^
should be set out as soon as danger 0
from killing frost is over. Set them n
in a furrow, three feet apart in the c<

TOW. Tne Dest son iur lumaiues is
a well-drained sandy loam; avoid soil
that has been in tomatoes the previous
year. Furthermore, they should 111

not follow Irish potatoes or watermelons.

to U. S. Forces in Mexico.
San Antonio, Texas, April 5.?Gen.

today that his request for
lore automobile trucks had been
ranted. While the addition of 108
lore trucks to those already carryig
supplies along the line of comlunications

rill serve to relieve the situation,
taff officers still regarded the use of
tie railroads from El Paso as essenial
to the success of the campaign
gainst Villa.
With six thousand horses and

that many men, the quartermster's

GERMANY'S SYSTEM. p
'an Move Army From Eastern to
Western Front in Five Days.
Germany's system for the rapid
ransportation of troops from one
attle ront to another was described ^
ecently by Captain Frank E. Kleinchmidt,
says a New York dispatch,
-ho has returned to his home here
fter 16 months with the Austrorerman
forces on three war fronts.
"The rapidity of movement of the ^
German armies," said he, "may be ai
ealiied when it is seen that entire .01
orps may be moved from the western e>
o the eastern fronts, or back, in two st
nd a half days. What the limit of
he transportation facilities, may be I ec
o not know, but I do know of my n<
wn personal knowledge of 40,000 ^
oldiers being started from the west- ai
rn lines to a position on the east- ?*
rn front and made ready for action ai
gainst the Russians in 60 hours." C
Captain Kleinschmidt, who is an al
Lmerican, is known here for his work
s commander of the Arctic expedi- r
ion sent out by the Carnegie Museum ^
t Pittsburg and as a big hunter and pi
xplorer in Alaska. ?
"With the most perfect and wellonstructed
roads and rails that I tci
iave ever seen,' the troops move p*
wiftly in comfortable cars to any
lesignated point," said Captain ta
Heinschmidt. "To mo it appears as V(
he last word in mobile fighting al
orees. Ennallv remarkable, too.
yas the ease with which supplies, ^
nunitions and guns kept pace with
he movement of the men. ei
"Another thing I noticed as distin- Si
ruished the German and Austrian m
node of advance or retirement from ni
hat of the Russians was in the
tandling of the railroads. Whereas w
he Russians destroyed towns and vil- CJ
ages and attempted usually in their E
etiring movement to wipe out food E
upplies, even growing crops, they inariably
left rails and road intact, t
,nd often failed to destroy important G
ridges.
"When General von Hindenburg
withdrew after his first attempt to
:et to Warsaw failed, he blasted out t(
very rail in his rear and left the ^
oadbed a hopeless wreck. Further a.
o impede the pursuing Russians, he ir
elled poles and trees over parallel
oads, and was soon safely out of
each."

RKPORT OS' PARDON BOARD.
Forty-nine Petitions for Clemency
Considered.
Columbia, April 7.?The State
board of pardons this morning filed
their report and recommendations
with Governor Manning on the applications
for clemency which they have
been considering for three days. Forty-nine
petitions for pardons, paroles
or commutations of sentence were
considered by the board. The most
widely known of the cases were those
of Joe Grant, the Edgefield negro under
sentence of electrocution for killing
a white man at Johnston in 1906,
and A. C. Tolbert, of Greenville, unJ
. c J . U />.. 4
tier sentence ui uecttn iui uavmg ^ *
his wife's throat. Grant is to die on ?.
the 14th and Tolbert on the 12th of
this month unless the governor
grants a stay of sentence. Tolbert,
a white man, cut his wife's throat in
a mill village in Greenwood. His
attorneys are claiming that he is insane
and are asking for commutation
of the sentence ^to life impris- ;M
onment. Attorneys for the negro,
Joe Grant, are making a similar request
for commutation of the death
sentence to life imprisonment. \ rjjl
Clyde Clement, serving a ten-year
sentence from Spartanburg for the v
death of a little baby, asked for a <^Jjj
pardon. Clement was given life im- 7 '
prisonment, but former Governor
Blease reduced the sentence to ten '
years.
Governor Manning will go over the
pardon board's report when he has
opportunity and either approve or
disapprove of their findings.

TWO QUART BILL NOT SIGNED. <1
Gallon-a-Month Law Stands for the
Present.
Columbia, April 12.?Holding that v f|||
the gallon-a-month law has made "a M
distinct advance for prohibition/*
Gov. Manning yesterday announced '
that he would not sign the two-q,uarts
a-month law at the present time. '"I
aeem 11 Dest mai 11 suouiu swuu,
said the governor, speaking of the v fj
gallon-a-month measure, which . was
passed by the 1915 legislature.
Gov. Manning has held conferences
with prohibition leaders from various rf
sections of the State concerning the
new liquor law. It was said yesterday
that he had reached the decision
4'after a careful consideration of the
subject from various angles."
The statement by the governor fol- ' ^
"The gallon-a-month law will stand > . ;Jj
as the law regulating the importation
of liquor into South Carolina
for personal use. This was the law
enacted by the legislature at the
same time as the referendum act ordering
the prohibition election, and
was in force when the election was
Held, this law nas maae a distinct
advance for prohibition by limiting
the amount of liquor used, and I
deem it best that it should stand, unless
something occurs to change the
situation. To retain the gallon-amonth
law is to keep faith with the
people, and, in my judgment, will go
a long way to promote temperance,
so long as it is rigidly enforced.
"I shall continue to direct a vigorous
enforcement. I will not, therefore,
at this time, sign the two- '
quarts-a-month act, but will hold
same in abeyance pending any
- S 2S
change in conditions that may occur."
