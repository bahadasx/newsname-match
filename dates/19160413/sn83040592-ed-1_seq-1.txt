$5,000 Suit.
Suit was filed in the Cherokee
Co. district court Saturday by J.
W. Keys who seeks to collect
$5,000 damages from Abram Dar-
denne. Jr.. and Lottie Dardenne,
his wife, for alleged breach of
contract.
Keys alleges the Dardennes
gave him an option oa a certain
piece of real estate, located in
Oklahoma, and that they sold the
land to another party before the
option expired.
According to the petition, the
Dardennes and Keys entered into
a contract on March 21, the pro
vision being that Keys could buy
the land for $8,250 any time with
in ten days thereafter. Keys al
ltges that later a contract was
made granting him an extension
of time until April 3.
On April 1, Keys claims he de
cided to take advantage of the
option and told the defendant he
would buy the land, but that they
informed him that they had sold
the land to Geo. W. Beck, Jr.,
for $12,000.
Alleging that the Dardennes
broke their contract with him and
that the deal cost him a large
amount of time and money, Keys
alleges he was damaged to the
extent of $5,000 and the suit is
the result.

of last week to talk over the mat

of a thousand dollars was pledged
right here in town, and we under
stand something like seven bun
dred dollars has been . pledged
in the country along the route of
the proposed improvement.
It is planned to properly grade
the road, and then coat it with
plenty of rock, dressed with
gravel.
After this work is done it is
then planned to make a gravel
road from Lincolnville to Qua
paw, and in this work the people

lend not only moral, but financial
aid.
It is very gratifying to note the
unity of feeling in this matter.
it shows that the people can re

realise lhe necessity of good roads
to the mines, it is a cinch that
better roads will be built.
