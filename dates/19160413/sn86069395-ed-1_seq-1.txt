This Week and Are
Much Pleased.
MR. SLADE'S BIG PRAISE
Says Christian County's Plan
Is Being Watched All
Over the State.
The Monday night meeting of the
Christian County Poultry Improve
ment Association was a well attended
affair and much interest was taken in
the illustrated lecture given by Prof,
A. S. Chapin, director in charge of
Boys and Girls Poultry Clubs.
Prof. Chapin is still very enthusias
tic over the prospects of success in
standardizing the poultry interests of
Christian county and is well pleased
with the progress of the work started
by Mrs. Eloise N. Graves, County
Demonstrator. .
Mrs. Graves has under her super
vision ninety-three children, which is
fifty per cent more than any other
county in tho State, and while Prof.
Chapin had set his figures at sixty
members, he has approved of the
larger number in Christian county on
account of the hearty co-operation
Mrs. Graves is receiving from the
school teachers over the county. He
does not think that more chil
dren can be handled successfully and
on account of the lateness of the sea
son for hatching, insists that no more
children be enrolled.
Prof. Chapin said that in his lec
tures in other counties ho told them
of the work being done in Christian
county and advised them to follow
the plans being worked out here in
standardization. The influence of
Christian county is spreading over the
state and he looks for a great improve
ment in poultry raising in other coun
ties as the direct result of the work of
the Christian County Poultry Im
provement Association.
The lecture at the II. B. M. A. was
illustrated with sixty views, many of
them views on Kentucky farms. The
lecture dealt with management, poul
try house construction, feeding and
club work and many points were
made of value to poultry breeders.
Prof. Chapin, Mrs. Graves and
County Agriculturalist Casey will visit
as many clubs during the week as the
time allotted will permit. Edwards'
Mill was visited Tuesday night, at
which place a large .crowd heard Mr.
Chapin's lecture.
To-night the lecture will be given
in the school building at Pembroke.
The meeting Tuesday night at Ed
wards' Mill was attended by over a
hundred people, who listened atten
tively to the speakers. '
On account of the absence from
Cadiz of the Trigg County Agricul-!
tural Agent, Prof. D. D. Slade came
direct to Hopkinsville from Caldwell
county and arrived here in time to be
present at Edwards' Mill. His talk
was well received aud of much value
to his listeners. He told of the noto
riety that Christian county was gaining
over the state and said we were the
most talked of county in the state,
that the plans of standardization were
being copied by other counties, five
counties already getting busy along
tho lines of work being done here.
Ho predicts that the Christian county j
plan will spread over tho entire state
and be adopted by all poultry raising
counties.
Prof. Chapin gavoan illustrated
lecture on management, care of
chicks, building brood coops and se
lection of breeding stock.
Mrs. Graves talked of Poultry and
Canning Club work and County Agri
culturist Casey spoke of the work
with Corn and Pig Clubs.
Wednesday several farmers on tho
Nashville piko who are co-operating
with the Christian County Association
in tho standardizing plan were visited
by tho experts.
Tho Wednesday night meeting was
held at Casky and the meeting to
night will be at Pembroke.

and similar municipal contracts, con
fer with the commissioners on con
tracts about to be renewed. Engi
neer Norcross, who was here not
long ago, submitted a . report on the
sewerage investigation he made. He
approves the present pi ivate system,
but says it should have flushes at tl c
head of the mains and that service
should be extended to all parts of the
city. He criticises some of the ex
tensions as not of a permanent nature.
He recommends a purchase of the
plant in 1920, if it cannot be done be
fore by agreement.

tarvia street improvements was or

extra wagon that can be used.
L. R. Crawley was awarded a con
tract to paint the three bridges, i. e.,
on West Seventh street, on Second

the state committee will be asked to
pass, what number does make a legal
quorum, borne of those who took
part in the election are said to be

CLIMAX EXPECTED SOON
Apache Scouts, Armed With
Sun Goggles And Wrist
Watches.
El Paso, Tex., Apr. 12. The pur
suit of Francisco Villa probably will
be brought to a conclusion within
forty-eight hours, according to infor
mation received here to-day by an
American mining concessionaire with
large interests at Parral and Torreon.
The messages received stated that the
report that Villa was dead was cur
rent throughout southern Chihuahua
and northern Durango and while it
was far from confirmed, it was e.v
pected that definite news would be
received within the next few days.
The report of Villa's death was ac
cepted as highly probable by Gen.
Bertani, the Carranza commander at
Casas Grandes, who now is in Jaurez.
"There is only one doctor in the
country where Villa now is, said Gen.
Bertani, "and if blond poisoning has
set in in Villa's wounded leg, as my
information has it, this doctor can do
nothing even if he has a chance. Wit
nesses who saw Villa told me his left
leg was shattered by a fail from his
horse, following his being wounded
by a bullet. They say his leg was in
bad shape, swollen and gangrenous."
Gen. Bertani said that Villa had not
more than fifty men with him. The
Villa band which his troops encoun
tered in tnc iMadera section yester
day, consisted of twenty-three mem
bers, of whom fourteen were taken
prisoners. Tho survivors, carrying
their wounded, escaped into the hills.
"Villa's forces consist now of only
a few handsful," commented Bertani.
They will have to be hunted down
like ordinary escaped criminals."
The Apache scouts have gone into
Mexico from Columbus, it was learned
here last night. Led by Peaches, the
j captor of Geronimo, they started
south on top of motor trucks. Each
Apache wore sun goggles and a wrist
watch.
The three leaders of the Diaz plot
to seize Juarez and overthrow the
Carranza garrison there last Sunday
were executed by the firing squad in
Juarez early Tuesday. They were
Nicholas Chavazarria, Jose Inez Bor
nel and Florcncio Hernandez. The
condemned men confessed the plot
before they were executed Other
Mexicans were implicated.

Siege.
NEWS ON OTHER FRONTS
Germans Gain Near Dead
Man's Hill but Are
Repulsed.
London, April 12. The armies of
the German crown prince around
Verdun are still vigorously on the of
fensive against the French.
Having delivered an attack along;
the line from Lc Mort Homme to
Cumieres which netted them a few
small portions French trenches on tho
east of Le Mort Homme, the German
commanders rested their infantry
here but in the region of Douaumont
Vaux, northeast of Verdun, threw,
their men in large numbers against
the French. Here again they met
with success, but only for a short
period of time, for the French in a
counter-attack drove the invaders
from advanced sections of trenches
they had captured and in the opera
tion took about 100 German prisoners.
While the Douaumont-Vaux attack
was in progress the Germans had not
overlooked the line between Le Mort
Homme and Cumieres and covered
the entire region with an intense ar
tillery fire, probably preparing for
another attack by infantry.
GERMAN COLUMN IS BOM- "
BARDED.
Along the remainder of the front in
France and Belgium, there were only
artillery bombardments. In one of
these north of the Aisne the
French guns caused serious losses to

are continuing to gain ground against
the Turks in the region of Erzerum.
Unofficial advices arc to the effect
that the Turks have re-grouped their
forces and now are resisting stub
bornly the three Russian main lines
of advance into their territory.
AUSTRIANS USE NEW ARTIL
LERY. The Austrians between the Adigo
