THE
The Board of Education of the Perrysburg Village School District presents herewith the prelim
inary plans lor the proposed new school building and new heating system for present High School,
for which a bond issue of $41,000 is to be voted on Tuesday, April 8x, 1916, at usual voting places.
DESCRIPTION OF PLANS
New School Building to be
built adjoining present high
school and new heating system
to take care of both buildings.
The first floor, which has three
entrances, provides for four
class rooms and a Central Cor
ridor with Stair Halls at each
end, and connection to present
High Schbol building.
The second floor contains a
Study Room for the High
School, seating 67, three Recita
tion Rooms, each seating 24, one
laboratory and a Central Cor
ridor with Stair Halls at each
end.
The Basement provides Boys
and Girls Play Room, a Manual
Training Room, Domestic
Science Room, a Corridor and
two Stair Halls.
The first floor of the building
is kept well above the ground so
as to provide ample light for the
various basement rooms and to
avoid going very deep into the
ground with the basement floor
and the sewer.
Each entrance leads to the
central corridor on the first floor,
which connects with all rooms.
The Library will be at the rear
of the Study Room, which will

give ready access to the students
during study hours.
The Study and Recitation
Rooms are lighted from one side
only, the light shining on the
left side of the pupils. Each
room will be provided with Black
Boards, and Class and Study
Rooms will have Wardrobes,
which will be ventilated, thus
drying wraps of students in in
clement weather.
The large Study Room on the
second floor will be used for the
seating of the High School, from'
which classes will go to the
three smaller rooms for their
recitations and to the Labora
tories for their work in Physics,
FIREPROOF BUILDING
The construction of the build
ing is to be a fireproof type
throughout. This type of build
ing, as herein shown, costs prac
tically no more than would the
ordinary old style with its num
erous fire escapes. Exterior
wall is to be of brick, with stone
j trimmings. All floors shall be re
inforced concrete with finish
floor. Stairways shall be fire
proof with self closing doors, at
each floor. All interior wood
trim o$ oalc or Georgia Pine.

THE COST
The cost of the proposed
building, including new heating J
system for old building, is not
to exceed the sum of $41,000.00. '
This means that ?4fc,000.00 will '
erect and equip the building, I
complete. I
The Law compels the school
authorities to let all contracts I
with-in the funds in the Bank.
No contracts are legal beyond
this amount. For this purpose, !
the Board of Education propos
es to issue bonds bearing a term
of 20 years. The Board and
those who have been studying
the proposition have worked out
very carefully the amount re
quired to finance such a plant.
A radical change should be
made in the heating and ventil
ating system of the present
building which has many very
objectionable features.
The experience of the few
years past has taught us that
the present heating and ventil
ating system is not only very
costly in operation but is also
very dangerous. The likelihood
of loss and damage with the con
tinued operation of the present
heating plant has been indicated
several times by the fact that a

dangerous fire had been barely
discovered in time to prevent
serious results.
The system of heating and
ventilating, while possibly the
best that could be devised at the
time the present building was
erected, has long since fallen in
j its results far below the require
ments of the present State
School Code as it pertains to the
I ventilating system. In fact, we
I doubt very much whether the
continued use of the present
ventilating system would be ap
proved or permitted by the State
Inspection Bureau, although
there is a possibility that with
extensive and costly alterations
made to the present heating and
ventilating system, continued
use of same might be permitted.
In the event that a new build
ing is built as contemplated, a
proper arrangement for the
heating and ventilating system
for the same would contemplate
the entire removal of the pres
ent obsolete heating and ventil
ating system and apparatus in
the present building and the in
stallation of one complete cen
tral plant to take care or not on
ly the new building but the en-!
tire old building.
If this plan were followed, one
