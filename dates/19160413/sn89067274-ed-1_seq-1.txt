51 LDU1S MURDERERS CONFESS
TO STEALING WIRE !N MEXICO
Roy Lewis in hi. Confession, Tells of
Stealing Bicycle From Fish Resi
dence Here.
"WAS FOUND IN THE GARAGE
Murderers Were Here Last Thursday
and Took Wire f rom aiecuic
Railroad Line on South End
Roy J. Lewis held as one of the
murderers of motorcycle patrolman
Frank J. McKenn and Patrolman
William A. Dillon, of St Louis, last
CM., tnas a sicmed confession to
the part he played in the crimes Tues
day. In it he stated he had stolen a
bicycle from a front porch in this
city. The wheel was found in the gar
age where the murder car was stored
and is evidently the wheel taKcn ""'
the property of John E. Fish, Div. FrU
and Passenger Agent of tho Chicago
4 Alton railroad, for whose return
Mr. Fish recently advertised reward
111
Lewis states that he wus in this
city the Thursday night before the
murder. That was the night the elec
tric railroad had $1000 worth of trol
ley wire stolen from the South end
of their line. Lewis said he was the
one who always cut the wire and that
was the principal purpose they made
of the two machines they used. He
alco evidently was one of the party
which stole the section of the South
western Telephone Co's. long distant
line to Jefferson City, from here the
night of April fourth.
Hill confession details a series of
robberies which includes the thicft of
twenty-five motos cars, stealing Jew
elry in Topcka, Kans, the kidnapping
of a Mr. and Mrs. Beach, at Pacific,
Mo., about six weeks ago when they
made them give tho use of their
motor car tor the robbers benefit
Story of the Wire Theft
In telling of his wire theft in Mex
ico, Lewis stated in his confession as
follows:
"Last Wednesday, Frank and
Ora my brothers and I left
this city in two machines, a Hud
son and a Ford, and rode to Han
nibal, Mo., We were around
Hannibal until about daylight
Thursday morning. We then
started driving across country to
Mexico, Mo. Got in Mexico about
1 o'clock in the afternoon Thurs
day. ' ' ;
"Along about 2:30 p. m. we came .
across some wire in the southwest
part of the town, about the edge
of the town. It was trolley wire.
It was close to a wagon road and
a street car line, but the car line
was not in operation. We got our
wire and started back.
"The way we got the wire was
by throwing a rope over the wire
pulling it down as close to' the
ground as possible and cut it '
with bolt cutters. I always did
this cutting. After cutting the
wire in one place it would drop
and then I would cut it in about
three foot lengths. I don't know
how much wire we got; I guess
about 1200 pounds. v
"We then started back and run
into St. Louis about 7:30 last Fri- ,
day morning. Me and my broth- '
er Ora were riding in the Ford
car.' Vfi had put this stolen wire
in both cars. I think we had most
of it in the Ford Car."
