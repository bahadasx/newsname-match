Note From de Facto Gov

Is Invitation to Begin

By ,'tssocialed Press
Washington, April 13. General
Carranza's proposal for the with
drawal of American troops from Mex
ico failed to bring from administra
tion sources to-day any indication that
they would he immediately withdrawn
or that the situation was expected to
result in any serious fraction with the
do facto government in Mexico.
The note, which arrived at the Car
ranza embassy early in the day, was
.prepared for delivery to Secretary
Lansing by Bllmo Arredondo, General
<'arrai'-'.a\s ambassador.
The development, not unexpected,
was received in Congress with diver
gent views but a general undertone of
caution and a disposition to leave the
situation in its present stage to tlie
administration prevailed.
Troops Will Ilentaiii
Administration officials, however,
made no effort to conceal their feel
ing that Carranza's action might in
crease the delicacy of the circum
stances under which the pursuit of
Villa has been conducted.
The outstanding features of the
situation gave evidences that the ex
pedition has been carried on with a
lull realization that objections might
arise, that possibilities have been con
sidered and probably a decision lias
been reached as to what steps would
be taken.
There was apparent agreement
among officials that the troops would
remain for the present, but that from
a diplomatic standpoint, it might seem
advisable not to risk local clashes
with Carranza forces during negotia

Authorities Along Border

El Paso. Texas, April 13. —The bor
der awaited with expectancy to-day
Ihe answer of \t.ie American govern
ment to General ''arranza's proposal
regarding the withdrawal of the Am
erical expeditionary force from Mexi
co.
In El Paso all was calm outwardly.
Nevertheless there was an under cur
rent of emotion, for it was pointed
out the situation is fraught with many
possibilities all along the international
boundary. Reports of the massing of
de facto troops in northern Chihua
hua have been prevalent for weeks.
The military and civil authorities of
El Paso have been preparing for
weeks against all contingencies. The
13.000 American troops scattered
!■ long the border from Brownsville,
Texas, to San Diego. Cal., have been
kept constantly on edge. General
George Bell, Jr., commanding tiie base
at El Paso has neglected no precau
tion to preserve American life and
property. There are reported to be in
tlie neighborhood of 3,000 troops sta
tioned at Fort Bliss.

De Facto President Declares

Expeditionary Force Has
Fulfilled Its Object by Dis

It Is Able
By Associated Press
Mexico City, April IS. The Mex
ican government has sent to its am
bassador in Washington a note to be
[ delivered to Secretary Lansing asking |
' that the American troops be with-'
11 i
! drawn from Mexican territory and l
■ I
i j that the pursuit of Villa be left to:
lithe Mexican constitutionalist army.
The Mexican note contains about
: live thousand words. In it the de
• facto government of Mexico contends
■ | that as the American troops crossed
into Mexico without permission, theyl
[ should be withdrawn until a proper
i formal compact can be entered into
i between the two governments. It is
I Insistently affirmed that the previous
; notes of the Mexican government es
pecially emphasized the fact that per-,
mission for reciprocal crossing of the,
I frontier would be granted only in the!
event of the repetition of a raid simi-|
lar to that made by Villa at Colum
bus, N. M.
Coding Negotiations
| The note was sent to Eliseo Arre- j
: !dondo, the Carranza representative in
I Washington with instructions for its,
I delivery to Secretary Lansing, "so end- j
: ing negotiations for a reciprocal pass-,
I ! ing of troops and asking for disoccupa
, tion of the territory occupied by Am- I
, erican troops in view of Villa's party
. having been destroyed."
Throughout the note emphasis Is 1
laid on the fact that the American |
expedition was undertaken under a
misunderstanding. Although acting
! in good faith the declaration is made
tliat the United States nafl Interpreted
the first note of the de facto govern-:
j nient as effecting a definite agree- j
| ment between the two nations. But'
! the intention of the de facto govern
ment was that no expedition should
be sent into Mexico until terms and
' conditions relative to an agreement;
| were delined.
j The note declares therefore that in
consequence of no final agreement !
having been reached as to the terms
"I of the treaty to regulate the reciprocal
i passage of troops over the dividing
■ | line, "the Mexican government judges
"j it convenient to suspend for the pres
' j ent all discussion or negotiations in
this particular, or founded on the cir- i
' cumstances that the expedition sent !
' by the United States government to |
• pursue Villa is without foundation in
! virtue of the nonexistence of a!
f previous agreement i formal and i

Tie Tinkling Bells to
Your Roller Skates Is
Chief's Tip to Children
Chief of Police J. Thomas Zeil
favors a scheme that youngsters in
several other cities have adopted while
roller skating on the paved streets.
The children in many cases fasten a
small bell to the shoe, which warns
vehicles that Ibe.v are approaching and
also aids pedestrians in keeping from
their path at street corners.
Several days ago an order was issued
by Chief Zeil to the officers to keep
children from roller skating on side
walks. He said that the children had
full right to the streets, but if they
cared lo adopt the plan of using a
small bell, the police would have no
objections.
Chief Zeil declared the bells might
prevent many ar accident, as drivers
of vehicles would receive the warning
tinkle even before the child rounded
the corntr.

DETECTIVES PICK
UP ANOTHER IN
DOPE DRAGNET
"Pct'bie" Albright Arrested For
Safekeeping; May Be
Big Witness
AFTER "S Y N 1) I C A T E"
Ring Still Operating Despite
Recent Arrests Relieve
Police
While under the influence of four
one-grain morphine pills which he
admitted he had eaten this morning,
Edward, nicknamed "Pecbie," Al
bright was picked up in the Eighth
ward at 1' o'clock this morning by
City Detectives Ueorge W. Shuler and
Hyde M. Speece, as one of the persons
believed to be obtaining "dope" in
Harrisburg. from persons who are vio
aiting the Federal laws. He was com
mitted to jail for safe keeping.
Albright displayed almost super
human strength when the two detec
tives attempted to bring him to police
headquarters, lint finally was over
come. Eater when the reaction of
t'.e drugs set in, he admitted eating
four pills, and more morphine was
found on him, believed to be one-grain
size.
The name on the box in which the
drug was found had been torn off, and
young Albright refused to tell where
! lie received his supply. City Detective
Shuler said that he believed one of the
"syndicate" operating here furnished
; the "dopes."
Have Girls as Witnesses
Authorities working 011 the case
have a number of young girls as wit
nesses and another one was found yes
terday, vhose name is withheld by
the detectives.
Further evidence gathered in the
lart "4 hours gives more light on tlie
big ring which it is believed Phipps
controlled before lie was arrested.
That the ring is still operating, but.
under other leaders, is the belief as
the investigations are continued. A
cottage along the <'onodoguinet, vis
ited yesterday, revealed more startling
proofs of the use of "dope," when a
hypodermic needle and a bottle of
dark liquid were found on the prem
ises.
More sensational arrests are ex
pected. it was said, and several more
witnesses may be added to the list.
Both of the men arrested on Tuesday
still refuse to talk.
