The Americans answered the fire,-killing many Mexicans.; The
Carranza soldiers did not fire but with the Americans" assisted 'in rc

; VVhen the Americans entered the town, the local commander recalled
the "American assurances that the U. S. troops would not pass through
towns. The excited citizens began firing on the troops. The situation
quieted down but later another clash of the troopV and civilians took'
place, resulting in many more deaths of Mexicans, v r
Carranza telegraphed the Mexican embassy here today, "Many
deaths on both sides occurred at Parral." Tie has applied to the United
States to r recognize the danger of arousing the natives. He ; says
the action of the American commander in entering the town was un

WASHINGTON, D. C, April 13. Gen. Venusticno Qrranzi's
new note on the Mexican situation, presented to the state department
today through Dr. Arredondo, the Mexican ambassador, raises a new
issue for American diplomacy- to confront while American soldiers
are marching 400. miles deep Mexican territory.; , ' . -.
; -The nptev' asking ,that,the Amer.can troops under Gen. " Pershing
be '"withdrawn immediately, is " regarded as raising a grave question.
State "department!' and other officials are reticent about 'discussing it
:and.wijt not .predict the, outcome. There are no? indications that the'
troops will be withdrawn or that the situation will result in serious fric
tion."., The development,, while not unexpected,, has bceiv; received in
Congress, with divergent yiew and. there is a general undertone tf
caution,' and a disposition to continue the present stage of .matters.
The note itself is 5000 words in lengtji. It contends that ' the
Americans crossed the Mexican .border without permission, and that
they should 'withdraw-until a formal compact is made. The note fur
ther says that the United States incorrectly interpreted the note of
March 10, to which attention was called on March 17. The present
expedition, it is held, "has fulfilled its object so far as it is able to. do
so," and that sufficient Carrartzistas are pursuing Villa to guarantee
that he and his bands will be punished.
President Wilson has cancelled his Speaking engagement ' for Sat
urday night in Nev.York. . - .
