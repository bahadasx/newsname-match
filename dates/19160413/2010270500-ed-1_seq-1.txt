fendants are Drainage District No.
2 of Dakota county, Nebraska, and
the Board of Supervisors, Jacob F.

Maxwell. The drainage commission
was organized to construct a ditch
to intercept the waters of Elk and
Honey creeks, which carry the draim
age of over 120 square miles of hill
lands, and to direct these crecKs so
as to carry the water from a low
tract southeast of Jackson. The
plaintiffs claim that the proposed
ditch, if constrncted, will cause the
water in Jackson lake to overflpw
upon the plaintiffs' lands and will
cause other damage. They ask an
injunction.
Sioux Gity Journal, 7th: "Farmers
of Dakota county, Neb.; have com
menced an organized fight against
smut, which annually destroys
thousands of bushels of oats, and
against scab and blight, which ren
der a large percentage of the potato
crop unmarketable. In their efforts
to eradicate the evils the farmers
are receiving the aid of O. II. Beck
lioff, county agricultural agent, who
yesterday conducted demonstrations
at the Elmer Blessing farm, near Co
bufn. The demonstrations were
witnessed by farmers from Jackson,
Dakota City and South bioux Uity,
it being the hrst test ot the kmu in
the eastern part of the stato. Oats
and potatoes are the chief products
of many of the farmers iri the coun
ty. The demonstration with regard
to oats was to show how to make
certain that the oats to be used for
seed this spring have not the slight
est taint of smut. This ii done by
the formaldehyde method, which
Mr. Beckhoff explained. If ordi
nary care is taken he assured the
farmers that the seed will enter the
ground without the slightest chance
of smut developing. The treatment
of seed potatoes to prevent scab and
blight is similar to that of oats,
with the exception that the potatoes
are dipped in a solution of formelde
hyde diluted with water. It is plan
ned to hold similar meetings
through the county.
Sioux City Journal, 8th: The elec
tion of Mayor-elect D. G. Evans and
of Councilman Ed Metz.of the Third
ward in South Sioux City, will not
be contested in the courts of Dakota
county, Neb. A. B. Cownie, defeat
ed, mayoralty candidate, and John
Jenkins, who lost out for the coun
cil by one vote, have decided not to
ask for a recount. The decision was
made known yesterday to Mayor C.
J. Kloster, who will retire from the
office in May; Mr. Jenkins said he
was satisfied that a recouat at least
would entitle him to a tie with Coun
cilman Metz, but had concluded that
the office was not worth a long
drawn out court fight. In view of
tho fact that the city council has
sealed the returns, that body will
make no move unless ordered to
turn over the ballots to the county
court. A special meeting of the
city council was to have been held
last evening, but had to bo abandon
ed because of the lack of a quorum.
Mayor Kloster said that he will call
another session for Monday night.
Members of tho new council will not
assume their duties until May. The
wets of Dakota City, Neb., have de
cided not to contest tho election in
which tho liquor vote resulted in a
tie, according to Attorney George
Learner, of Dakota City. Tho liquor
forces of that town threatened to
file contest papers demanding n re
count of the liquor votes on the
ground that the election judges er

terday denied that her granddaugh
ter, Miss Lottie Robertson, of Dallas,
S. D., was married to Addison A.
Raridall, who formerly operated a
grocery near 1700 South Lynn street.
A license was issued to Addison A.
Randall to marry Miss Robertson
by Harold W. Henderson, a clerk in
the district court clerk's office, on
April 1. The address of Randall
wa3 given as South Sioux City and
his age at 22 years. Miss Robert
son's age was given as lD years.
Ray Smith, 28 years old, of South
Sioux City, was the witness who
signed the marriage record that the
contracting parties were of age.
Shortly after the appearance of the
license in the newspapers Randall
went to Dallas. He had a meeting
with Earl Robertson, father of Miss
Robertson. As the result of the
conversation Randall hurriedly left
Dallas, according to Mrs. Compton.
No return of the marriage license
has been made to the clerk's office.
Miss Robertson lived in Sioux City
with her grandmother up to a year
ago, when she went to Dallas to join
her father, who conducts tho hotel
there. An investigation of what ap
pears to bo an April fool joke ill

were laid before that official by Clerk

A Word for
Nels Johnson
The following article is reprinted
from tho Oakland Independent:
Oakland, Nebr., Mr 2$, 191G.
Editor Independent:
I note with pleasure yn- announce
ment of your dqtermihuon to sup
port Nels Johnsop in Tiis'canvasd for
tho nomination for state senator from
the Sixth district. I am reminded iri
this connection of tho time when Mr.
Johnson entered the race as candi
date for the legislature for tho first
time. In introducing tho candidate
to tho voters of Burt county I wrote
at that time:
"Ho is a man who will never bo
owned or bulldozed by any machine
of state or county extraction. Ho is
clean and able. He has tho moral
courage and the back bone that is the
most palpable need of the present
timq in tho state house. In all, he
is a candidate Burt county need not
be ashamed of and for whom every
voter who favors a clean, high-principled,
and, above all, a do-something
legislature will Bupport.
"Mr. Johnson's candidacy was an
afterthought. Likewise it was a
happy thought. It was unpremeditat
ed by Mr. Johnson. Tho thought of
him came as an eleventh hour inspira
tion. Now, this Bection hm nnb fur
nished a candidate for a number of
years. Therefore thiB section is en
titled to the selection of a candidate
in this instance. Mr. Johnson filed
only upon tho earnest solicitation of
his friends. Ho was the precise man
for the precise moment.
"As a Burt county man Mr. John
son will have tho interest of the
farmers at heart. As one who lives
in tho city will have at heart tho ma
terial welfare of those who live in
tho city. As he is young and
strong he will bo useful in tho legis
lature. Ashe represents what the
Independent represents, tho Inde
pendents wnnts him for a candidate.
If the republican party is on the
square and wants a candidate who
will be a source of strength to it, it
will make no mistake by naming
Nels Johnson as its candidate."
Mr. Johnson was elected, and his
subsequent record in the legislature
and as a public servant vindicated tho.
judgment of tho Independent. He
made good and tostered and support
ed progressive measures throughout
the session of which he was a mem
ber. Ho kept freo from "ontang
ling alliances,, and proved hirn'self
trustworthy and efficient. In local
affairs has been Bano and conserva
tive and has proved himself useful
in all his official capacities.
I havo not always approved of Mr.
Johnson's course of action and our
opinions on various questions have
been at wide variance. That, howev
er, is immaterial. In fact, It is this
divergence of opinion in which is em
bodied the security of our instituti
ons. For out of it comes tho ulti
mate and proper course of action in
affairs of stato and nation. There
fore I seo fit to disregard disagree
ments on questions not at issue in a
campaign such as this to endorse
Nels Johnson as tho man for the job.
Yours very truly,
A. Theodorq Sohlborg,
