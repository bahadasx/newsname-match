EI Paso, Tex., April 13.—The border

General Carranza's request that the
American troops be withdrawn from
Mexico, "v
There was an undercurrent of emo
tion here, for it was pointed out the
situation was fraught with many pos
sibilities, all along the international
boundary.
If the^rovemment responds favor
ably te the demands of the de faoto
government, the exciting epoch .of the
past few weeks will have passed, but
if Washington maintains that the pur
poses of -General Pershing's expedition
have not been accompllsKM a new
period of anxiety will ensue.
Soldiers on Edge.
In EH Paso and other cities along
the border a large portion of the popu
lation are Mexican. Massing of de
faoto forces in northern Chihuahua
has been reported for' weeks.
The military and civil authorities
have been preparing for weeks against
all contingencies. The 19.000 army
men scattered along the border from
Brownsville, Tex., to San Diego, Cal.,
have been constantly kept on edge.
County and city officials, and in this
state Uhe famous Texas rangers, have
combined to corral Mexk&n agitators
and to nip. in the bud Incipient dis
turbances that might have developed
}nto embarrassing troubles. .Every
thing possible has been done to safe
guard 'the American side of the Rio

Laredo, Presidio, and Brownsville, in
Texas, Columbus, in New Mexico,
Douglas, in Arizona, San Diego, in
California, and all ttye smaller towns
on the border also ha/vfe taken pre
cautions for defense.
EJach step has been made, of course,
with a view of encountering and'meet'

is pointed out by officials here that
after presentation of the Carranza re
quest for a withdrawal the range of
possibilities has broadened.
Carranza Troops on Move.
Interest quickened today on the re
ports of Carranza troop movements in
northern Chihuahua. Army officers
declared that in their opinion General
Carranza could not have presented his
not? to Washington without having
made military preparations.
Reports therefore that the de facto
troops were in a position where they
could cut the lines, of communication
established, by General Pershing were
received as truth.
There is no great concern here for
the ultimate fate of 'the American
force. While advance detachments
under Colonels Dodd and Brown have
penetrated almost to the Durango
border, more than 400 miles south of
El Faso, these have rejnained in touch
with the advanced field base at Satevo,
and have received "large quantities of
supplies near Parral.
For some time the motor supply
train operating from Columbus has
been strained to the utmost to
get sup
plies and forage to ,the front-to last
the trooips for some. time. It is be
lieved now this preparation was made
tp meet such a situation as has now
arisen."

Several Days of Fierce
Fighting.
ONE ATTEMPT TO
FORCE FRENCH LINE
Germans Capture Few French Trenches
Between Dead Man HiSI and Cum
ie^es, But Defenders' Hold Main Po
sitions Offensive Movement on
Eastern Line Apparently is Subsid
ing—'Russian Attaoks Failing.
The attack on Verdun has sub
sided for the moment, after sev
eral days of particularly severe
fighting. There were no engage
ments of importance la that re
gion last night, the official French
statement of this afternoon says.
The principal German effort since
the general Verdun offensive was
begun Sunday has been the attempt
to force a passage between Dead
Man Hill and Cucumbers, for the
purpose of enveloping the hill. Some
French trenches in this vicinity
were carried, but the main positions
of the defenders were 'held and
Paris regards the operations of the
week as having resulted decldfedly
to the advantage of the Frencih.
On the eastern front Russian at
tacks have not seriously shaken the
German lines and altho spirited
fighting still is in progress the of
fensive movement apparently is
subsiding.
The Russian sailing vessel Imr
perator, on a voyage from Gulf
port, Miss., for Marseilles, has been
torpedoed in the Mediterranean.
Nine of the .crew, some of them
wounded, have been landed.

Russian Sailing Vessel Torpedoed.
Barcelona, Spain, via Paris, April 13.
—The Russian sailing vessel Imperator
has been torpedoed by an Austrian sub
marine in the Mediterranean. Nine of
the crew, some of whom are wounded,
have been landed here by a Dutch
steamship.
GBR MANS FORCED TO PAUSE.
Operations Halted to Fill Gaps iit
Ranks and Bring Up Munitions.
Paris, A/prll 13.—Another lull has
fallen on the Verdun battlefield as the
Germans have been Obliged to pause
in order to fill up the gaps in their
ranks, to replace damaged- guns and to
bring up munitions to prepare for fresh
onslaughts.
The German general attack on the
left bftQk of the Meuse Is regarded as
having been beaten and the Germans
have reverted to the previously rela
tively small alternate strokes against
the French positions on both sides of
the river, and to artillery dperations.
When the remaining French projec
tions along Forges brook had been
straightened out the Germans were
able to engage the principal line wect
of the river from Avocourt, by Hill No.
304, and Dead Man's Hill, to Cumieres.
Only frontal attacks under difficul
ties were possible except at Dead
Man's Hill, where the Gentians were
able to attack thru the ravines. They
tried to force a passage between Dead
Mian's Hill and Cumieres and to work
around the south of the hill in order to
envelop it. After hard fighting this
maneuver failed and with it is be
lieved to have collapsed the main ide*
of that German attack.

FOUR ARRESTED ON
CHARGE OF ARSON
Employes of Hamburg-Amerioan and
North German Lloyd Steamship
Lines Held For Alleged Conspiraoy—
Two Said to Have Confessed Partici
pation in Conspiracy to Destroy
Vessels Carrying Ammunition.
New York, April 13.—Defectives who
yesterday arrested four Germans
charged with placing bombs on ships
carrying munitions of war, today
sought evidence involving a "well
known German," who Is alleged to have
supplied a $10,000 fund to finance the
fire bomb conspiracy.
They also sought the chemist who
manufactured the bombs.
,'Four employes of the Hamburg
American line and North German
Lloyd steamship companies here are
under arrest charged with attempted
arson either in making bombs or tak
ing part in the conspiracy. They are
Earnest Becker, Captain von Klelst,
Capt Otto Wolpert and Capt. Enno
Bode, superintendent of the Hamburg
American line piers In Hoboken.
Preparations were made to arraign
them in a Brooklyn court today to
answer the specific charge of placing
bombs in sugar bags *1 board the
steamer Kirk Oswald on May 2, 1915..
The steamer caught fire from bomb
explosions while on her way to Mar
seilles, France. Unexploded bombs
were found in her cargo after her ar
rival there.
Mayt Expose Great Conspiracy,
Police Captain Thonras Tunney, itfho
has charge of the case, regards the ar
rest of the four prisoners as the most
important stride yet made in the de
tection of. a great, conspiracy: to de
stroy steamships sailing with war mu
nitions ffom New York, Boston, Phila
delphia, iSan Francisco and Seattle.
The police believe the men involved
have been responsible for fires on at
least thirty-three steamers that have
caused' $4,OOiO,ftOO damage.
They assert they have evidence that
bombs made in a Hoboken factory were
seilt to all parts of the country. The
use to which they were put, other than
the destruction of steamers, has not
been disclosed.
Detectives asserted today that one
of the prisoners said he had been sent
to the factory in Hoboken by Captain
Franz j'on Papen, former military at
tache of the German embassy at Wash
ington, who was recalled at the re
quest of the United States.
Bombs Made in Fertilizer Factory.
The Hoboken factory was a small
structure in which a few men were em
ployed. One of the prisoners said It
was at first used to make fertilizer for
tho German government, and that the
Germans extracted lubricating oil from
the fertilizer after its arrival in Ger
many.
Both Von Kllest and Becker are said
to have confessed making bombs. The
parts played by the other two men
have not been told. It is hinted ihat
the first clue to the conspiracy came to
the police as the result of dispute be
tween the men higher up In the con
spiracy and the chemist who supplied
the explosives. iMany of the bombs are
said to have failed to explode and con
sequently the chemist was chlded and
had difficulty over his payment.
Quarrel Leads to Disclosure.
Dlscovenr of the plot was brought
about, according to the authorities at
rfoboken, thru the discontent of a man
who had quaireled with the leaders
over money payments. The Hoboken
authorities Baid that this man, whose
Identity is withheld, told them -that
Captain Boy-Ed, tho German naval at
tache In Washington, and Captain von
Papen. the military attache, had. be
fore their departure from the United
States, placed a large sum of money at
the disposal of the bomb makers.
The-four prisoners were taken from
police headquarters to the office of Dis
trict Attorney Cropsey, of Brooklyn,
for prosecution in that district, but af
ter a consultation between the detec
tives in charge and the attorney, It was
decided to turn them over to the de
partment of Justice.
Accordingly they were taken to tha
department's office after which a con
sultation was held with Attorney Mar
shall as to what disposition should be
made with them.
Det.ective Henry Bardh Is credited
with unearthing the plot. Bardh was
assigned to the task of finding out
whether there was a German con
spiracy to blow up ships, shortly after
Fraitk Holt, the man who shot J. P.
Morgan last July, had confessed he had
placed bombs in the steamer Minne

Americans Return Fire.
The skirmish yesterday at Parral
was not regarded as serious, except
from the fact that It was coincident
with the announcement that the pres
ence of American troops in Mexico was
no longer desiruble. It is beileved tbiuS
all commanders in northern Mexico
were apprised of the government's in
tention and that the garrison at Parral
might make the relations between the
de faoto troops and the American
troops strained.
Little was known here of the Parral
trouble. General Guiterrez reported to
Consul Letcher, at Chihuahua, by say
ing the American force had marchel
into Parral and the populace aqd gar
rison had met them with a rifle ftrS
that was retnmed by the Americans.
.,The reports characterized it as "an
exchange of shots" and made no men
tion of casualties.
General Kiinston assumed that the
detachment of Americans was a com
mand under Major Tomklns. He dis
credited the suggestion that the Amer
ican*- hud any intention of occupying
Parral.
