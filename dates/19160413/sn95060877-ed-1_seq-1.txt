Brushes With the Villistas
(Associated .fress)
PERSHING'S ARMY.
Thirty negroes of th& 10th U.
S. cavalry, who fought the
Villistas at Aguas Calientes,
on April 1, returned today
and described the fight.
They stated that the ad
vance guard was ambushed
by the Mexicans. They shot
a few of them and then pur
sued the remainder up the
mountainside, driving the
Villistas, killing a number,
but abandoning the pursuit
when the Villistas reached
familiar trails and vanished.
Gen. Pershing travelled
with the train, the fight took
place several miles in the
rear. The first attack was a
slight one against the truck
carrying the baggage and
supplies of Pershing's staff.
The final attack was made
against the rear trucks. The
soldiers withheld their fire
until several bandits came up
to within a few feet of the
trail. It is believed there
were several Mexican casual
ties, but no American.
There were about 40 Mex
icans in the attacking party,
supposedly under Gen. Tar
ango's command.
