An optlmlstlo view waa lent by the

Secretary Lansing .aid he had not
received the Mexican note and de-
cllnod to .divulge what his polloy to

Moxtcan Ambassador Arredondo de
clined to discuss the note. The Mexi
can embassy was said to be trans
lating the official text of the message.
vtien this Is accomplished it will be
taken Immediately to the state de
partment. Washington, April U.-jprovlslon-al
President Carranxa considers that
"t la already time to treat with the
United State, government tor with
drawal of their forces from bur ter
ritory." - This announcement In a note from
the'de facto government's secretary
or state, .an unofficial text of which
has arrived here, brought the admin
istration face to face today with what
may prove the most serlou. situation
that has grown out of the pursuit of
Francisco Villa. "
Declaring that the do facto regime
never formally agreed to lot Ameri
can troop across the 'border, the note
reported en route here said:
"The Mexican government judges
It convenient to suspend for the pre
sent all discussion of negotiations In
this particular." i ,

II
Becomes Critical When the
that Villa's band la dispersed and on
the further ground that Carranxlsta
troops believe tbemaelvea able to
complete the task of exterminating
the bandit leader and bis few remain
ing follower.
Officials today frankly admitted
there waa a possibility of a misun
derstanding bavlng existed. In nego
tiation with Carranxa aa far a they
have gone. Tbe United States troops
entered Mexico while tbe protocol un
der which Carranxa proposed the
chase should be conducted waa 'being
completed, and before It had been
fully agreed to. Now Csrransa de
clines to complete this agreement or
protocol and suggests tbat it Is time
to arrange for a withdrawal of Amer
ican forces, leaving further pursuit
to Carranxlstas. 1
In proposing the protocol. Car
rsnia's note says, Mexico did not con
alder the raid on ' Columbus Itself
should result in Invasion.' He em
phasises that It must bave been clear
tbat Mexico gave the United States
troops permission to cross only In
case the massacres were repeated.
The note Indicates belief that tbe
sovereignty -of Mexico has been vio
lated. It says that a Mexican agent
called on Counselor Polk of the state
department, and tbat folk Said the
United States thought Mexico bid
given permission for tbe expedition
to enter.
Paced with the nation's demand
that Villa be captured without regard
to technicalities, yet feeling that one
mistake may undo four years' diplo
macy Intended to establish good feel
ing between the nations, and confirm
peace In Mextco, the White House felt
that the situation required the most
careful handling. It was confident
that the issue would be handled suc
cessfully.
The note relates that Lansing ex
pressod extreme regret at ; the situa
tion and that Carranxa finally agreed
troops already In Mexico might re
main pending completion of another
agreement by which the "first chief"
was to gtve them permission to oper-
America, .aid the note, assured
Carransa the expedition wpuld confine
the sole object of
apprenenaing vuia. uarranza now
consldors that object accomplished,
therefore Mexico will not complete
the proposed second agreement for
further operations. I
The message reminds the United
States further that the expedition has
no legal standing, and that the time
has come to consider its withdrawal.

ships already on tbe ways, the Union
Iron works of San Francisco today
signed a contract with the Standard
Oil company for tbe construction of
three more oil tankers at a cost of

pany. The new vessels are to be of tbe

capacity aa the, 10 now. under con
struction. They are to be delivered

actually being built or fully outlined
In plans and designs , and awaiting
only the making of contracts. The

all over1 the United States. ' '

110 FEDERAL PROBE
OF GASOLINE PRICE
Washington, April 13. The de
partment of Justice is planning a new
dissolution suit against tbe Standard
Oil company, it was reported today,
Therefore It will not Investigate the
advance in gasoline prices at this
time. , " .

ot Justice will refuse to comply with
the senate's, demand for an investi
gation of gasoline prices on the
ground that such a move would not
be compatible with public Interests
now.

ahown the supposed Standard OH
company dissolution to be ineffective,
It was reported.
The various companies are work
ing in harmony and control prices in
most, of the oil country. -
JERSEY COW III
L
Salem, April 13. Owing to the
presence of a Jersey cow, .locked and
heavily chained to a pillar of the
ohapel rostrum, devotional exercises
were dispensed with at - Willamette
university this morning, tor the first
time .In many years. How the cow
mounted the long .flight of steps at
the entrance to the chapel Is a mys
tery. She must have been pulled up
by a block and tackle. A Junior
milked the beast about chapel time,
much to tbe relief, of "bossy's" ud
ders and to the amusement of Inter
ested students and. spectators.' At
10:30 the cow was still representing
the absent faculty, who deemed It
Unwise to dispute "Queen Arabel's"
right to" reign on the rostrum.
Dissatisfaction with a faculty rule
that all students must attend chapel
or be subject to dismissal Is believed
to have caused student, to put the
cow In the chapel.

HIS PASSPORTS
New York, April II. A rumor
that German Ambassador ron Bern
storff would be handed bis passports
within a fortnight caused a drop In
the stock market today.. Though the
story was unconfirmed and without
(basis except the word of Washington
brokers, It gained general circulation.
Leading stocks dropped from one to
three points.
MAKING UP CASE
T
Washington, April IS. The tables
are clear for a "show-down" pn tbe
submarine Issue. Today the admin
istration Is completing evidence tend
ing to prove Germany, guilty of re
peatedly violating Its assurances with
regard, to conduct of the undersea
campaign.
"The government will act now In
a manner entirely satisfactory to the
people," said . an : Intimate friend of
President Wilson, today.
Tbe fact that Germany admits at
tacking a vessel near where the Brit
ish steamer Suasex waa .damaged by
an explosion strengthens the admin
istration's position. It Is held, even
though the kaiser said the ship his
war craft torpedoed , was ; apparently
,not the Sussex. , .
The Berlin claim that Germany
never promised to,., treat freight
steamers the same as liners Is a large
factor In the discission. Secretary
Lansing believes that Germany could
not legally decline to include freight
ers in its assurances with regard to
liners. .
Proof of many solemn pledge vio
lations since the Lusltania was sunk
Is expected to be, included In the ad
ministration's answer to Germany.
The Teuton . disclaimer of responsi
bility proposed further negotiations.
In the past the -administration's
position has been not to consider ar-
bltration of questions In which Amer -
lean : fives were concerned. Officials
said .that Germany's suggestion of
arbitration had been answered by,
President Wilson's previous attitude.
,The Sussex note has reached tbe
state department, and experts there
are busy deciphering its code phrases.
President Wilson's coming reply
was characterized today as "Informa
tion for Germany" information con-.
cernlng what the administration has;
AGAlfiS
GERMANY
tending to prove Germany violated ( at Columbus today believe the Amerl
its assurances and what may be ex-' e,ne,mon )nt mu i. n.
pected If the danger of recurring vio-'
lations is not removed. It was ex-
pected the American reply would be
ready next week.
I GET VILLA
SAYS GEN. FUNSTON
'
San Antonio, April 13. General
Funaton made It plain today, that he
would never consider the American
expedition Into Mexico a success un-.
til Francisco Villa had been captured
or killed. His attitude, however,
will be arnverned bv Washington. . I
Funston declared the expedition
would continue hunting Villa until
the war department ordered It to halt
or until Villa was. taken. He denied
the expedition would be In danger
If Its supply lines were cut and In-'
tlmated that he had full confidence
In the ability of the Americans to
take care ot themselves.
Funston flatly denounced the Car-
ranzlstas for their failure to co-
operate with the American forces. He
pointed out that constitutionalist. (
had, twice permitted Villa to slip
through their lines.
