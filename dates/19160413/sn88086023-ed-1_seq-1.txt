FARMER IS ON TRIAL ON
ALLE6ED ASSAULT CHARGE
W. J. MARTIN OF MILTON BEFORE
yCWS IN THE CIRCUIT
COURT TODAY.
The trial of W, J. Martin, Milton j
farmer charged with an attempted
criminal assault upon Miss Cizerlne !
Megy, Is under way today In the cir
cuit court. A jury was selected from
local men on the regular panel and
two drawn special. The most Import
ant witness for the state has been the
girl herself. She testified that Martin
came for her in his auto to take her
to his home to stay all night with
hie daughter. This was on June 29,
1915, when she was only i; . years
old. On the way he kept caressing
her, she testified, and twice pulled her
out of the car and threw her to the
ground. She finally escaped from him
after her clothing had been torn.
Lloyd Chase testified to seeing the de
fendant throw the girl to the ground
and swear to kill her if she did not
yield. Others testified to seeing him
trying to caress her. W. M. Peterson,
attorney for the defendant, by cross
examination tried to discredit the
girl s story. The defendant Is a mid- 1
die aged man and today is wearing
large brown goggles over his eyes. At
the time of Jils arrest he was con
fined In the Milton Jail from which he
escaped. He was recently apprehend
ed !n Montana and brought back for
trial. Deputy Prosecuting Attorney
R. I. Keator is handling the case for
the state.
The couple claim to have been mar
ried In Idaho and appear very affec
tionate toward each other. The girl
claims to be 17 years old and the po-
lice state that she has the appear
ance of being thut old.
The girl came to the police station
to see Love this morning and ih.
meeting between the two was such I
that Chief Gurdane and Officer Ed
wards found something out of the :
window to hold their attention Thr !
girl has spent the day in Jul with
the man she claims as husband. He
li about 24 and claims New Castle

AT PRIMARIES.
Both the Islo.OOO bond Issue mea
sure and a measure providing for an
rilditlonal two mill road tax for a
period of five years will lie placed up
on the ballot at the primary election
May 19. This was decided by the
county court this morning.
The court is not compelled to put
either measure upon the ballot. The
petitions circulated for the bond is
sue measure lacked 133 names of hav
ing enough to compel the court to call
an elect'on. However, there were
enough names to give the court an
option of submitting the measure to
the people and the court Is exercising
this option.
No petitions; however, were circu
lated for submitting a measure pro
viding for a two-mill special road tax
but requests were made by prominent
taxpayers that such a measure be
placed In the ballot. The'court was in
doubt as to its authority and asked
the opinion of District Attorney Stei
wer. He rendered an opinion this
morning to the effect that the court
could place such a measure on the
ballot but that the vote upon it would
be in the nature only of a straw vote
for the guidance of the court.
In the event it carried It would not
be mandatory upon the court to levy
the special tax. However, should th's
measure carry and the bond issue fail,
the court would have the privilege of
Including the additional two mill road
tax In the levy made next December
Any registered voter in the county
will be privileged to vote upon the two
measures regardless of politics.

MAXY REPORTED KILLED
IN CLASH AT PARRAL
WASHINGTON, April IS. The
Carranza ambassador this afternoon
transmitted a commnnhMkn to
Lansing saying; that many were killed
on both side in the dash between
American troops and Mexican citizens
at Parral. it was claimed that Car
ranzista troops restored calm.
COLUMBUS, April 11. (Censored.)
Although It is inadvisable for th
Americans to withdraw from Mexico
r.ow, a break between the United
States and the de facto government la
inevitable, if Carranza's request la not
granted. In the opinion of a high mil
itary authority here Many officers
believe that the troops will be with
drawn. It was declared as significant
that constitutional 1st units are occu
pying strategic positions, commanding;
the American supply lines.

8AN ANTONIO. April 11 Cat-j-anzpita
soldiers and Mexican citizens
at Parral fired on American troops
there. Consul Letcher reported, giv
ing as his authority General Goiter
rex. There were ae casualties. Gu
tierrez has adopted a complaining at
titude. Letcher reported. He saW he
had no idea that Americana were so
far south. One hundred and fortv
men, believed to be part of Tompkins'
command, comprised the force at
Parral They continued marching,
little heeding the firing
Funston declared he would not
consider the American expedition a
success until Villa was captured or
killed. He flatly denounced the Car
ranzistas1 failure to cooperate with
the Americans. He pointed out that
the constitutionalists twice permitted
Villa to slip through their lines
WASHINGTON. April 13 Carran-
i za's note suggesting that the tlnte had
come for the American troops to leave
i Mexico has not been given to Iansing
yet. The Mexican embassy declared
! that the note was not an ultimatum
or a demand that the Americans wlth
j draw. It was rather a request, ask-
ing for negotiations looking toward
the withdrawal and giving the con
j stitutionalists a free hand to continue
the chase.
Carranza now considers that the
i object of the expedition has been ac-
compnsnea ana me message, it is be
lieved, refuses to complete the sec
ond agreement for further operations.
It reminds the administration that
the expedtlon has no legal standing
now.
The disoccupation of Mexico Is ask
ed for on the grounds that Villa's
band has been dispersed and the Car
ranzistas believe themselves able to
complete the tusk of extermination.
Some thought the note was intended
for home consumption In Mexico.
