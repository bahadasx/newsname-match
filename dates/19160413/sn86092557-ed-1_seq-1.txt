Earnest Search For Villa Will
Go On.
. WASHINGTON, D. C., April 13.? General Carranza in a note which ar.
fl rived here early today for presentatio n to Secretary Lansing asked for the
p ^withdrawal of American troops from Mexico. It raises a new issue in a
^|iiituition already much complex the outcome of which officials are reticent
to predict until they have gone over the communication carefully and con
ff si do red what reply the United States will make.
In official quarters it was stated that American troops will not be
withdrawn at this time at least and while the question is being discussed
b with General Carranza the pursuit of Villa bandits would be rushed with
Krencwcd vigor.
fMEXICO CITY, April 13.?The nole
which .the Mexican government has
sent to Washington lor delivery lc?
Secretary J^ansing asks for "dlsocc?i
pation of territory occupied by Am
erican troops in view of Villa's party
having been destroyed." Throughout
the note, emphasis is laid on the fact
that the American expedition was un
dertaken under a misunderstanding.
'Although acting in good fa'th, the
^declaration is made thui tue United ,
"Sates had interpreted the first note of
e* de facto government as effecting '
?definite agreement between the two
"nations. But the intention of the de

statement points out, in a note dated ;

and ended. These declarations made
by; Mr. Polk were later confirmed

T.ittle Action Yesterday, But j
New Movement Is
Anticipated.
PARIS. April 11?Calm prevailed in j
the whole region of Vsrdun last night,
this morning's official communis-!
110:1 says. 1-reparaUon was made by
the Germans lor an attack on Hill
'30J, but tlje attack was prevented by
Preach- Trom* b^ingr'rarrfp^ iiifiT
j offccl. No other important develop
j ments were reported at the front.
The German general attack on the
| left bank of the Mouse, which began
on Sunday, is regarded as hav.tig
I be_*n beaten and the Germans have
reverted to the previous relatively
1 small alternate strokes against the
1 French positions on both sides of the
river and to artillery operations.
When the remaining French projec
tion along Forges Brook had been
straV*-toned out. the Germans were
unable to engage the principal lines to
the WMHf, of the r.ver from AToeouri
by Hrll No. U04 and Dead. Man's hill
at Cumieres. Only frontal attacl s un
der difficult, conditions were possible
at Dead Man's hill, where the Ger
mans were ablo to attack through the
ravine. 1
They tried to force a passage be-.
twecn Dead Man's hill and Cumieres,;
and to work around to tlie south of
the hill in order to envelop it. After i
two days of lighting this maneuver'
failed and with It is believed to have
collapsed the main idea of that par
ticular Gernian attack. The small
gain which the Germans made north
east of the hill is not regarded as of
a nature to modify the situation. The
military observers point out that. Gen
eral Petain once more has succeeded
with a minimum wastage in beating
off with heavy losses the adversaries'
attacks. S*nce the first month of iho
war the output of IMnch shells in
large shells. 44 times; 2;> times as
many 7r?-milometer guns are being
made as in August. 191-1. and the
manufacture of heavy guns' has in-j
creased in the same ratio.
