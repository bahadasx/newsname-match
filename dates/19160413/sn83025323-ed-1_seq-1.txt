CIRCLE DIAMOND FLOUR
NOW ON THE MARKET.
Product of the Malta Milling Com
pany Placed on Local Market
First Time This Week.
"Just as good'flour as I ever used,
and it makes dandy bread,"was the
verdict last night of Mrs. Fred C..
Cooper of this city, who had the
honor of receiving the first sack of
flour ever made in Malta. Some
time ago Mr. Cooper asked Mr. Sur
vant if he would give him the first
sack of flour ground in the new mill
and he was promised the first one.
True to his word Mr. Survant sent
the very first sack put up to the
Cooper residence and Mrs. Cooper
seems to have had excllent results
from what is recorded above, as her
actual words after using the new
flour.
The opening of the new flour mill
in Malta by the Malta Milling com
pany marks the opening of the first
manufacturing industry in this part
of the valley and to John Survant is
due all the credit for being the first
one to start an important plant like
this in his home town
Work on the new mill has been
pushed as rapidly as possible all
spring and we now have as fine a
little mill his any town of the size of
Malta in the northwest The Malta
mill is of fifty barrels capacity and
front present indications it will be
kept runninng to its full capacity
to keep up with the popular demand
for the new flour.
The new mill is located on Mr.
Survant's lots just back of the store
of the Malta Mercantile company,
near the river on the north side.
It is a commodious three story struc
ture with huge elevator bins on the
west end that have a capacity of
8,1)00 bushels of grain. In the base
Icent, which, by the way is of solid
concrete, is located the 25 horse
power Fairbanks-Morse ngine which
furnishes the power for the mill.
The engine is of the very latest type
and burns coal oil.
On the first floor is the flour pack
er and office for the manager and
the large set of scales for weighing
the wheat as it comes and also a
smaller scale for weighing the flour
after it is sacked. Just west of the
first floor is the covered driveway
where farmers can drive up to the
mill with their grist. Everything is
so arranged that a farmer can leave
his grist at the mill and in just one.
hour be able to return home with
his load of flour and feed. The bran
packer is also on the first floor.
The second floor contains the sev
eral sets of rolls for making flour
and the electrical plant whereby the
wheat is treated by a patent process
to properly age it before it goes into
the rolls. Up on the third floor is
where the wheat is thoroughly
cleaned bef re being used. Four dif
ferent cleaners are required to prop
prly cleanl All the wheat and these
are of the latest make. "
Mr. W. E. Ballamy, who has been
foreman for the Northwestern Mill
Construction company, and who had
charge of the building of this mill,
will remain in the employ of the
Malta Milling company as head mill
er and at any time will be ready to
and willing to show the people of
Malta through the mill and show
them just how Circle Diamond flour
is made.
The name chosen for the flour,
"Circle Diamond," was se
lected by Mrs. Geo. Ball, who
resides in Phillips county up
north of Saco. No more fitting name
could have been found,and it pleases
Mr. Survant greatly on account of
his having been associated with the
Circle Diamond brand for the past
32 years. When he first landed in
Montana he was a forty dollar a
month cow puncher for the Circle
Diamond company and afterwards
advanced to foreman and then on to
manager of all their interests in
northern Montana. With the advent
of the dry lander the vast herds of
cattle removed to even greener pas
tures until gradually they were all
gone and the old range is today
covered with farms and literally cut
to pieces with wire fences. Today
when you see the name and brand
"Circle Diamond" on the sack of
the new Malta Milling company's
product it may not mean much to
the present day settlers, but to the
old timer it will bring to mind pleas
ant memories of the good old days
that are gone- -never to return. ,

County Surveyor Richardson re
turned the latter part of last. we:.':
from a trip over on the line near the
power plant where, in company with
the surveyor of Blaine county, they
surveyed out the line between the
'two counties to find out just where
the killing of Bud Secrest took
place. After the line was surveyed
it was found the trouble occurree
some tour and one-half miles across
the line in Blaine county. The
Blaine county authorities were re
luctant to act in the case until such
a time as the boundary line wv s
fled, and there has been a great deal
of jangling between the officials of
the two counties.
We learn the case against Bernie
O'Riley will come up for hearing at
Chinook early in May and from the
evidence produced at the inqust
there will b little or no trouble in
proving that O'Riley was in the
right and that the killing was done
in self defense. Tressler & Kirton
.have been retained on the case and
will have Mr. Hurd of Great Falls
to assist.
George Plummer and Henry Baeth
are in from the Larb Hills today.
D. Wadell and wife were register
ed at the Great Northern hotel last
evening. They returned to their
home at Dodson this morning.
MILK RIVER PROJECT.
Water Ready for Use April 25 from
Both Dodson North and
South Canals
Applications for water service:
The irrigation season under the
Dodson North and South canals will
will begin April 25th. The lands
under these canals which can be ir
rigated are those on the south side
if Milk river between Pint of Rocks
reservoir and Strator, and on the
north side between Dodson and the
end of the canal system. Application
blanks for water service may be ob
tained from R. E. Ellis, canal super
intendent at Wagner, or from the
Reclamation service at Malta. In
this connection, these applications
should be submitted in the near fu
ture, in order that an estimate of
the scope of the territory to be cov
ered may be made and thereupon
proper provision made for the deliv
ery of water. The charge for this
water service is $1.00 per acre-foot,
I payment thereof becoming due on
March 1, 1917. Although the appli
cation provides for water from Milk
River only, it is expected that water
from the St. Mary river will be I
available before the end of the ir
rigation season.
Due to the fact that on Dodson
South canal near Strater the head
works for the Bowdoin canal are be
in gbullt and a.t Nelson reservoir the
headworks for the Nelson reservoir
South canal are under construction,
it is at present impracticable to run
water through the canal to Nelson
reservoir, but since St. Mary water
and the entire flow of Milk river
during October and November will
be available for storage in Nelson
reservoir, there are ample oppor
tunities to fill this reservoir before
the beginning of the irrigation sea
son of 1917.
MALTA TO HAVE. CHAUTAUQUA.
W. E. Cummins of Billings, state
agent for the Ellison White Chau
tauqua system spent a few days in
our city trying to interest our busi
ness men in a chautauqua to be held
here early in August. More than
twenty of our enterprising citizens
signed the contract to make it pos
sible, and we can all look forward
to a week of pleasure when the cha
tauqua comes. The program to be
given here is the same as will be
giveh in one hundred other cities
acid` towns in Calitfornia, Idaho, Ore
gop, Washington and Montana.
That the company pleases the peo
ple is vouched for by the two sys
tems, the run covering the whole
western country they go back each
year to every town the coming sea
son. It is hoped that everyone will
enter into the spirit and boost all
they can. It is acknowledged as the
greatest "American Institution in
America," and is a great benefit to
any community which enters into
the spirit of the thing.
There were over three thousand
chautauquas in the United States
last year, costing more than five mil
more than eight million people,
which gives some idea of the magni
tude of th movement.
C. C. Johnson was up from Glas
gow on business yesterday.
Mrs. Ezra Ereaux of Wagner, was

M. J. Silverman of Helena was a

tion of this kind and some of the
cities have as many as three candi
dates The names of the candidates,

ranged in alphabetical order and
Mr. Tressler's name is the last on
the list. Kindly remember this when
you go to vote.
