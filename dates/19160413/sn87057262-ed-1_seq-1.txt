Inadequate Transportation Facilities Makes
the Campaign Against Villa Approach
a Critical Stage.

BL PASO, Texas, April 13.—Army
"cers in Columbus believe that the
nited States expedition in Mexico is
pproaching a critical stage.
The danger lies in a communication

With the rainy season due in about
month when trails south of Colum

time, anny officers stated privately
at the expedition must have free use
the Mexican railways or withdraw
ora Mexico. The alternative is to
ntinue provisioning the troops in the

The trouble has been insufficient
lupment, because the army never
xpected to be compelled to penetrate
25 miles into a strange country with
ut the use of railways. The recent
ommercial use of the Mexican lines
as afforded practically no relief,
ny men declared.
For a week Colonel Dodd's cavalry

Trade the Cans for Eggs.
COLUMBUS, N. M., April 13.—
Army Aviators Dargue and Gorrell,
waiting here today for the new high
powered aeroplanes ordered by the
war department for Mexican service,
told of trading empty tomato and
gasoline cans to native Mexicans for
eggs. The cans were prized for the
construction of stoves and roofing
houses. The basis of exchange was
a can for an egg. The fliers said that
sixty eggs were obtained in this
manner and that five American sol
diers ate all sixty at one meal.

WASHINGTON, April 13. The
tables are now clear for a "show

Germany on the submarine queetkm.
Disclaiming responsibility for the ex
plosion whioh wrecked the Sussex in
the English channel, and declaring
itself guiltless of any violation of as-|

submarine attacks upon four other
vessels carrying Americans, Germany
nevertheless in its answer to in

made the anticipated proposal for
further negotiations.
SUSSEX WAS TORPEDOED,
ENGLAND IS CONVINCED
Official German Report is Tak
en as Almost Positive
Proof of the Act.
[By Ed L. Keen. United Press Start
Correspondent.!
LONDON, April 13.—Positive proof
that the Sussex was torpedoed was
seen by British officials today in the
German admission that an unidenti
fied steamer was attacked by a sub
marine in the same place and at
practically the same time the channel
liner was damaged.
It is officially stated that no other
vessel was torpedoed in the channel
at the time mentioned in the German
note transmitted to Washington.
The Sussex was damaged at 3:&0
p. m. on March 24. The German note
states that the vessel attacked by the
submarine was torpedoed at 3:55 p.
m.
According to the French official
report, the Sussex was south of
Dungeness buoys and about in mid
channel when the explosion occurred.
The German note says the vessel at
tacked was south of Dungeness buoys
and about in mid-channel when she
was torpedoed.
The Sussex was steaming at about
sixteen knots an hour..
The German note says the vessel

Proof of mauny violations by sub

given this government, from the time
the Lusltanla went to the bottom, up
to the present, is expected to be in
cluded in the communication to be
sent by this government in answer to
Germany's note of today.
In the past this government always
has taken the position that arbitra
tion of questions on which American
lives were concerned would not be
considered. Today it was said by of
ficials that Germany's suggestion for
arbitration was definitely answered
in the president's previous attitude.
The admission In the German note,
the British declaration that no other
steamer was a/ttaoked In the channel
at the same time and the Paris report
that the (French government even has
the names of the crew of the sub
marine that attacked the Sussex, has
practically clinched evidence already
in the hand8 of the government that
the Sussex was torpedoed, officials
held today.
The Sussex note reached the state
department today and deciphering
was at once started.
The coming communication of the
president is characterized as "In
formation" for the German govern
ment—information as to what this
country has in the way of proof of
violated assurances and information
as to what may be expected if danger
of recurring violations is not remored.
Tomorrow the affidavits on t'ne
Sussex case are expected. These are
important only as "exhibits" in the
case.

torpedoed was steaming about eigh
teen knots.
The entire forward part of t.he Sus
sex was torn away by the explosion.
The German note says "the entire
forward part was torn away to the
bridge."
No submarine was seen by any per
son aboard the Sussex. The German
'note says the submarine was sub
merged when she torpedoed the
steamer.
Only in the description of the ves
sel attacked does the German note
*fail to tally in nearly every particular
with the facts as collected by the
I British and Frcnch governments. It
was held here that the boat com
mander, sketching his victim hastily
iby a view obtained through his *per

The discrepancy between the de
scription of the steamer mentioned
in the German note and published
I pictures of the Sussex is not so great
as to offset other evidence, it was
held here. The German foreign of
fice described the steamer torpedoed
jas a "long black craft."
Pictures of the Sussex show that
she was a typical low-lying channel
boat. Berlin described the vessel
torpedoed as carrying one funnel and
two masts. The Sussex had one
