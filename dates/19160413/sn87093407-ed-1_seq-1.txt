COLUMBUS, N. M. y April 13 (Cen
sored). —While it would not be advisable
for the American force* to withdraw
from Mexico at present, a break will be
inevitable if Carranza's request i» not
granted, in the opinion of a high military
authority at the army base camp here.
Many officers believe the troops will
be withdrawn.

WASHINGTON, April 13.—President
Carranza considers that "it is already time to
treat with the United States for withdrawal
of their forces from our territory."
This announcement in a note from the
de facto government's secretary of state, a
text of which has arrived here, brought the
administration face to face today with what
may prove the most serious situation that has
grown out of the pursuit of Francisco Villa.
The Mexican embassy here declared the note was not an
"ultimatum" nor a "demand," but rather a "request." asking
for negotiations looking toward withdrawal of American
troops, giving constitutionalist* a free hand to continue the
Villa chase.
- At a 25-minute conference with Secretary Tensing, Mex
ican Ambassador Arredondo presented Gen Carran/a's sug
gestion that American troops withdraw. After the meeting
Arredondo was reticent, altho he suggested Lansing had not
yet had sufficient time to consider the matter
President Wilson has canceled his proposed trip to S'ew
York Saturday for the purpose of addressing the Young Men's
Democratic league.
Declaring that the de facto regime never formally agreed
to let American troops cross the border, the note said:
"The Mexican government judges it convenient to sus
pend for the present all discussion of negotiation* in this
particular."
Believe* Own Men Are Equal to Task
"Disoccupation" of Mexico by American troop* was a*ked
on the ground that Villa's hand is dispersed and on the fur
ther ground that Carranzista troops believe themselves able
to complete the task of exterminating the bandit leader and
his band.
Officials today frankly admitted there was a possibility
of a misunderstanding having existed in negotiations with
Carranza as far as they have gone.
The United States troops entered Mexico while he
protocol under which Carranza proposed the chase should
be conducted was being completed, and before it had been
fully agreed to.
> Now Carranza decline* to complete this agreement or
protocol, and suggests that it is time to arrange for a with
drawal of American force* .'aving further pursuit to Car
ranzistas.

WOULD STOP
TRAFFIC AT
DRUGSTORES
GUI
Mayor Gill today proposed, in a remarkable Interview
with a reporter for The Star. THAT THE CITY OF SEAT*
TLE <]O INTO THE SALOON BUSINESS.
The mayor offers this startling suggestion as the only
effective means of eliminating <he illicit sale of liquor by
drug «tores
"I Mitfgest," tic t<>l(2 The Star man. "that the next se»-- '
sion of the legislature t>e asked to enact a law permitting
cities of the first class to take charge of the sale of whisky
by physicians' prescription. Druggists should be forbidden
to sell it at all. The city should establish stations at widely
distributed points in the city sufficient to accommodate all
emergency needs."
Such a law. the mayor declares, would quickly pat
of business drug stores which have sprung up for the 101 l
purpose of harvesting a fat profit off whisky drinkecs..
Persons who wsnt liquor would be compelled to |«6
kit by the method provided in the prohibition lew, thm -
[permits i««ued by the county auditor.
And the worst of the blind-pigging would be wiped out,
at least so ,far a* Seattle is concerned.'
Prosecuting Attorney Indorsee Plan
Mayor Clill has given the prohibition enforcement prob*
lem con«iderable study.
"There may be," he continued, "some legal obstacle#
the plan. I don't know about that. But if there aren't, it
certainly looks feasible to me."
Prosecuting Attorney Lundin Thursday gave the mayor*#
idea his emphatic indorsement. He said he sees no reason
why it cannot be carried thru.
It i« possible that the state republican convention, to be
held at North Yakima on May 6, may be asked to adopt
resolutions favoring such a law a« the mayor has advocated.
"There are a lot of shyster doctors," Gill declared, "who
will sell st whisky prescription to anyone. As long as Seattle
is afflicted with these fellows, and with professional blind*
piggers, we are going to have trouble enforcing the law."
The mayor told of the frequent inquiries he receives faf
information as to how the prohibition law is working out.
in this city and state.
Declare* Prohibition Has Helped City
"I tell these people," he said, "just what I can see with
my own eves that prohibition has been a wonderful thing
for Seattle. I know men who now keep their families clothed
and their grocery bills paid who, in the days of the saloon,
never had a nickel men whom I've seen almost every day
for years. I know that times are better. I'VE SEEN
ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT I AM NOW A 'DRY'—DRY
AS AND I'M GOING TO STAY A 'DRY.'
"There may be «nnif soaks who still go into the back
room of a I'rug store and guzzle their booze, but your boy,
and my boy. aren't doing it. There aren't any saloons for
them to walk into. And if I have my way, there aren't going
to be any saloon-drug stores either."
The mayor intimated lie will adopt a new policy in
dealing with drug store violators of the liquor law.
"I am told," he said, "that some men have come in
here to sell whisky, prepared to suffer occasional arrest, and
fight the cases thru to the highest courts, figuring they can
get rich fast enough in spite of fines and confiscated stocks.
"They are willing to fight a defensive battle in court. It
costs them money, hut it costs the city time and money too,
in prosecuting them. And the blind-piggers figure they can
charge the expense up to profit and loss.
Mayor Proposes to "Get Rough" With Guilty"
"I AM IN FAVOR OF GETTING ROUGH WITH
THEM. If the police drop in on them every day "for a while
with search warrants, and perhaps wreck their places for
them every now and then, they won't have such an in
solent disregard for our laws."
The mayor indicated he would have a conference with
Chief Beckingham and give him some instructions along this
line.
Also, he is contemplating asking the council to support
him in a drastic war on the illegal drug stores.
"The city," he said, "will l>e sued for destruction of prop
erty, I suppose, but 1 don't believe any jury would 'stick'
us very hard on the complaint of a blind-pigger, and I'd
like to take a chance. Anyhow, it wouldn't cost us very
much, and we'd be getting in some darned effective licks."
The mayor suggested he might start his "rough stuff"
by giving orders to have the lAK) cases of beer found aboard
a scow in the Fast waterway, I uesday, dumped into the bay.
