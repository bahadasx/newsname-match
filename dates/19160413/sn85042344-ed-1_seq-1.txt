PLAY SMALL POLITICS
McGraw Men Show No Dis
position to Interfere
With Harris Deals.
DURANT, Okla.. April 12. As was
anticipated, James A, Harris
succeeded in forcing tho Third district
Kepuhllcun convention to instruct its
two delegates to the national Repub
lican convention to vote for hlin for
national committeeman, but he did
not do so without considerable vex
ation and trouble. There was a de
cided disposition among the delegates
to abide by tho statu convention
which selected J. J. McGraw, but
through Harris instructions secured
before tho state convention and sev
eral trudes on patronage and other
matters, the Harris program was car
ried through. There was no disposi
tion on the part of the McGraw sup
porters to Interefere with the Harris
deals, and there was much soreness
over the action of the convention,
which was regarded as merely play
ing small politics that might ulti
mately prove embarrassing. Tho del
egates elected were W. W. Matthews
of McAlester and Clark Wusson of
Antlers,
Gets 130 Votes.
The resolutions to Indorse Harris re
ceived 136 votes; 129 votes being cast
against the resolutions by supporters
of McGraw. Harris and McGraw were
present. The eight Republican con
gressional district conventions have
been hold in Uklahoma, and so has the
Republican stato convention.
Of the U delegates from the con
gressional districts, four are instructed
for McGraw and tho four delegates at
large are also Instructed for McGraw,
making a total of eight unlnstructed
and uncontented delegates. Of tho 16
delegates from the congressional dis
tricts six are Instructed for Harris and
are uncontested. The two delegates
from the Fourth congressional district
are unlnstructed. There are contesting
delegations from the Fifth and Sixth
districts. Including the four delegates
at large there will be twenty delegates
from Oklahoma In the Republican
national convention.

Carelessness or Ignorance on tho
part of tho office of commissioner of
highways of Oklahoma Is causing
much trouble for owners of automo
biles In Tulsa. Although the statu
license for 111 Hi was supposed to have
been taken out on the first of the
year, it has only been wit bin the past
few weeks that owners here could get
any blanks and utter filling nut tile
blanks many of them are still with
out numbers.
In most cases the trouble Is being
cuised ow.iers of new cars Unit Hi re
not In use last year. Several , local
owners filled out Hie blanks properly
but us their uirs were only made this
ear. of course, left that pari referr
ing to tint data for l'.H.'i blank. Much
to their surprise they received letters
from the commissioner demanding to
know why they had not filled out tho
blanks properly and refusing to issue
a lirense until surli had been done.
Judging by the letters sent back to
the commissioner, souielhiiM is liable
to happen ut Oklahoma City before
very long.
