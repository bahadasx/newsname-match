Stnki Rich Yiii At On Knob Mint!
Laurel Spring Special to Winston
Salem Journal.
The work at Ore Knob copper
. mines is being pushed forward
with all possible speed and it will
only be a few days till i the shaft
will be in shape tor lowering the
pumps to the water, when the
trask of clearing the great under
ground space will commence in
earnest. The rebuilding of this
shaft has been a slow and haz
ardous job and one that called
for expert constructive workman
ship. The timbering np of this
great hole in the earth had to be
gin at the top and proceed down
ward, and . the heavy timbers
that had to be used rendered the
task all the more dangerous,
since the slip of the foot or a mis
guided touch of tbe hand would
land a human soul into the bot
tomless pit of eternity.
Tbe mining experts who are in
charge of this work think that
they will be able to pump the
mines Jclear of water within 30
days after the pumps are put in
operation.
A rich vein of copper was found
while timbering the walls of the
shaft that gave great encourage
ment to the promotors of the
mines. This vein of copper seem
ed to be of considerable size and
was almost the pure metal. The
dirt had fallen from this ledge of
metal and left it bare so it was
plainly visible. Mr. Anderson,
who is engineering this work, is a
man of great experience in min
ing and says he has never found
a more encouraging prospect
than at this place. II the mines
prove as rich as is now expected
they will be worked on an exten
sive scale and a line of railroad
will be built at once from some
point on the Virginia-Carolina
to Ore Knob. This road would
start from West Jefferson, or
near that place, and come by the
quaint little town of Jefferson
and direct from there to the cop
per mines.
Ore Knob is less than 30 miles
from the present terminus of the
Elkin and Alleghaney road and
this would leave only a short gap
between these two points which
surely would not remain open
very long. The completion of
this line of road would give a di
rect and through route from
Winston to Abingdon, Va.
The building of this road would
link a section of country to the
outside world that has for all
' time been cut off from transpor
tation and communication with
the busy marts of commerce and
business. This would give Ashe
and Alleghaney a southern out
let and put these mountain coun
ties in direct touch with the great
State of which they form a paH.
Ashe, Alleghaney and Watauga
have always been practically cut
off from the rest of the State by
the Blue Ridge mountains and
the truth of the matter is that
the people east of this great di
vide, have always regarded the
Blue Ridge as "the jumping off
place" and that the people who
inhabit this mountain section
Were a "little inferior" to their
more favored brothers who dwell
in the low-lands. When this
country is once placed upon the
map of railroads and commer
cial advantages and the epithet
of 'mountain hbosier" will soon
cease to be applied by the "sand-
lappei."

The Short Routt Ti Boons.
The Hon. Frank Linney recent
ly had the pleasure of discover
ing a very good road down the
summit of the Blue Ridge to
Darby. This road is practically
unknown but it is a fact that it
is a fair mountain high-way.
this makes the route via the Wa
tauga & Yadkin River Railroad
the shortest route to the most
beautiful of mountain towns
Boono. Mr. Linney came over
this road for the first time a few
days ago from Boone through
Aho and Stories Gap, down the
Sampson Mountain to the pres
ent terminus of the Watauga &
Yadkin River Railroad. A spec
ial train happened to come to
Darby a short time after Mr.
Linney arrived there. By mak
ing this connection he arrived at
North Wilkesboro early in the
evening, the shortest time that
has ever been made between the
two towns.
It does not seem to be known
that a train leaves Darby every
day, except Saturday, at 10:10
a. in. for Grandin and North Wil-
kesboro. On Saturday the train
eaves Darby at 9:10 a. m. and
5 o'clock p. ra. There being two
passenger trains on that date.
Travelers desiring to go East
ward or South from Boone can
by starting a little early in the
morning, catch the train leaving
Darby at 10:10 or 9:10 if it is
Saturday, and reai h North Wil
kesboro in time for a train which
will leave North Wilkesboro when
its new time table goes into effect
at 4 p. m. The distance from
Blowing Rock to Darby is only
15 miles. A good horse and bug
gy can make the trip in three
hours without making very much
of a effort with the present con
ditions of the roads, which are
always good down the mountain
because the road metal is good.
It would not take over four and
a half hours to make the entire
distance to Bopne. I believe this
is the time in which Mr. Linney
made the trip from Boone to
Darby, without making any
special effort to get there, as he
expected to stay in Darby over
night.
If any one is interested in ship-
ping vin the new snort route,
they should call upon or write
Prof. B. It. Dougherty, who has
time table and tariffs and will be
glad to inform the public The
Watauga & Yadkin River Rail
road needs the patronage and it
is believed that the general pat
ronage of Watauga County will
very much help to bring the rail
road to the top of the mountain.

To the Boys on Southern Farms:
Editor Poe has asked me to
tell you what quality I think will
help you most to meet success ei
ther as business men or farmers.
That is what may be called a
"tall" order, because success does
not depend upon any one quali
ty. If, however, I should limit
my remarks to what I think is
the most important factor in the
success of an individual, whether
in farming or any other calling, I
would say this: The surest road
to success for any boy is to do
the work or the task allotted to
him better than anybody else did
it before.
No matter how humble the
work or insignificant the task,
do it better than anybody else
ever did, if that be possible. If
you go at your work in this spir
it you will get results. The boy
who has this kind ol determina
tion will do his work better than
the boy who hasn't it and does
not work in that spirit. The wil
ling boy, the eager boy, the hust
ling boy, whose mind and heart
are in his work, will out-distance
all the other kinds of boys, and
sooner or later his employer will
fix his eye on him and give him
promotion when opportunity of
fers. I have very little confidence in
the thing that peoplecall "luck."
Most "luck" comes from what
one does for himself. Every boy
and every man creates largely his
own opportunity. If you work
hard enough and intelligently en
ough and show that you have
ability and character, it won't
be long before it is recognized,
and the minute it comes to be rec
ognized, then opportunity will be
seeking you all the time.
Take the case of a lawyer. As
soon as he begins to show that
ie tries his cases as well or bet
ter than the other lawyers in the
community, people who need the
services of a lawyer will be at
tracted to him and the first thing
ie knows he has all the practice
ie can take care of. It is so in all
walks of life. The boy or the man
who proves his ability is sought
after for the best positions and is
given the best opportunities, be
cause he creates them by his own
ability and his own force.
Learn to rely on yourself and
do your task, as I said before,
better than anybody else ever
did it before you, and you will
certainly get there on the farm
or in business or in professional
life. 1 was brought up partly on
a farm myself. . Many times have
1 chopped wood, picked cotton,
milked cows and washed dishes,
and have done almostevery kind
of chore about a house and on a
farm. This was made necessary
because I was brought up in the
wide path of desolation which
General Sherman left behind him
when he marched through Geor
gia in the Civil War. But it is an
experience of which I am proud,
because it fitted me in a larger
degree for the bigger tasks of life
than I would have been had I not
been compelled to shift for my
self.
This is a land of rare opportu
nity and the American boy has a
great heritage of freedom and lib
erty and independence. What a
glorious thing it is to have such
a birthright and what a splendid
chance every American boy has
to make a career for himself that
will shed lustre on his country
and prove himself worthy of the
distinction of being an American
citizen.

The Mexican may be lacking in
efficiency along some lines, but as
a lyar he rises from the rank of
the artisan into that of the ar
tist. All that the American ex
peditionary force know of Villa's
whereabouts is that he isn't
where they can put their hands
on him; and that he is certain
not to be where all the natives
say he is. The story of the hip
shattered by a rifle ball, and the
escape in the carriage was well
constructed. No cobbler at his
trade put that together; it was
scientific mendacity.
After all, it seems that the A
merican people congratulated
themselves too soon. The chase
is likely to be a long and ardu
ous one, and every day that it
continues will add to the vexa
tions and difficulties of the job.
Uncle Sam is endeavoring to
cross "a torrent roaring loud on
the unsteadfast footing of a
spear" only the torrent hastur
ued out to be wider than was ex
pected: instead of a torrent it is
beginning to seem a river or an
estuary. "If he falls in, Good
night!"
The President only recently bit
terly condemned persons whom
he accused of spreading false re
ports about conditions in Mexi
co; but equally worthy of con
demnation are the people who
would spread false optimism.
Falsehood on either side at this
juncture is liable to be terrible
costly, in money and in bluod, to
the United States; and yet the
truth is exceedingly hard to ar
rive at
Certain elements of the Bitua-
ion, however, are only too plain.

ing south. The south is in an
uproar. Half a dozen bandit
leaders hold the country under
as much control as the central
government exercises; they are
quite as likely to give V ilia shel
ter as to turn against him, and
almost certain to oppose the A-
merican troops if they penetrate
that far.
Carranza, on the other hand,
no matter what his personal at
titude, is sitting on a volcano,
and is acutely aware of the fact.
Under the circumstances he can
hardly be expected to maniiest
any active friendship toward the
orces that, when all is said and
done, have actually invaded his
country.
The situation, as regards Villa
himself, holds little menace. It
is the corns of others that we are
so likely to tread on in our pur
suit of him that make dangerous
walking.

SENSATIONAL EVANGELISM.
Mr. John P. Arthur, now in
Chattanooea. Tenn., sends The
Democrat the following clipped
from a paper published in that
city, with request to publish:
An evangelist down at Chatta
nooga has pointed outeightdev
ils in women, and just think of it,
fellow citizens, they want the bal
lot Johnson City Staff.
The same "evangelist" follow
ing, this brilliant and edifying
discjovery about women preached
a sermon from the classical
theme "How a big, greasy, graft
ing, pie-eating, stand-pat, lick
splittle politician got religion."
How far this sort of public barn
storming goes to the injury of
genuine religion and the embar
rassment of the church's influence
for the elevation of the race and
the enlightenment of the masses
has not yet been determined by
any systematic survey, but there
is no need of a survey to demon
strate that it does no good. A
few people are temporarily ar
oused, some, perhaps, to serious
ness, but for the most part the
effect upon intelligent persi ms is
resentment if not disgust'The ex
cuse that these offensive utter
ances appear a great deal worse
in print than they sound from
the pulpit renders them all the
more hurtful because many more
DeoDle read of them than hear
1
them. It has been argued in an
swer to this that if the reading of
them is hurtful the newspapers
ought not to print them; but if
the newspaper refused to print
t hem it would be charged as an
enemy to the "evangelist and
antagonistic to the "cause." It
apparently has not occurred to
some of these peripatetic pulpit
eers that they ought not to say
things from the "sacred desk"
that are unfit to print. Sam Jones
was a good man and did good,
because his expressions from the
pulpit never had anything vi
cious or "vinegarisish," but he
would have been able to do very
much more good if he could have
taken his example of saying 'off'
things inoffensively with him
when he went away. His imita
tors lack his genius, ability to
impress sincerity and his spon
taneous eloquence if not much of
his genuine piety.
