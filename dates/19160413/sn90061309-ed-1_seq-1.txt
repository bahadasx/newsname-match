And Now For Monroe The City Beautiful, Will
J. J. CRITES FOR
LIEUT. GOVERNOR.
A little over a year ago, theTren
ton Times had the honor of first
announcing to the militant and
stalwart Democracy of our great
State, that Hon. Joseph J. Crites of
Rolla would make an efficient and
capable presiding officer of the
State Senate, and should be nomi
nated by the Democratic party lor
the office of Lieutenant Governor.
Since the publication of our an
nouncement, practically two hun
dred (200) Democratic newspapers
have seconded our motion, and en
dorsed Mr. Crites for this nom
ination It would require too much space
in our columns to review and re
print the different comments and
favorable expressions with respect
to the good name and character of
Mr. Crites (is mentioned in the
different newspapers and press of
the Stale.
ll is Millicient to say. that the
many endorsements i.f the press of
the t,ile and the numerous active
supporters of Mr. Crites. hevond a
doubt, lh.it tile Democratic Party
will add strength to its ticket, in
November, lv having the name of
Joseph J. Crites thereon for the
otliee of Lieutenant Governor.
It is important that the party in
the coming election shall nominate
men who have the approval and
support of the voters throughout
the entire State as shown by the
endorsements of Mr. Crites.
The elections in recent years
have deiui nslrated that the voters
of the Stales as well as the Nation
ure guing to vote and cast their
ballots for men who have withstood
the sunlight of publicity and who
in their daily lives, have shown
that l hey wear the badge of hon
esty and the record of a good name.
The endorsements, already given
Mr. Crites, so early in the campaign
is proof that he is made and con
stituted of this kind of material
and that his nomination will make
votes for the Democratic Ticket in
the general election.
Mr. Crites has never held public
office nor sou'ht public favors
from the voters of this state before.
He has contented himself in pur
suing the duties of bis profession
and by serving in the rank and file
of the party, always and unceasing
ly advocating the principles of his
party and ever found, under the
democratic banner, fighting for the
election of the Democratic ticket
He has earned his reward by a
long and faithful service, and the
Democrats of North Missouri join
hands with the Democrats of the
South. East, West mid Cent nil Mis
souri in endorsing his candidacy.
Mr. Crites is a lawyer of marked
ability and the reports of the de-
cisions of the appellate courts of!down from Brookfield Tuesday af-
Missouri, attest the record of Mr ' ,ernoon to meet with ,he members
Crites as a lawyer, and shows nj,' of the Commercial Club and allied '
ispeci.it r1u.iUfi1.tio..s for the presid-!
I inu officer of the State Senate.

d eared to him thousands of men by
the tits of fraternal friendship that
time cannot erase nor politicians
mar, and he is known in every
County of this Imperial Common
wealth of Missouri. But, he has
a strong following outside of frater
nal circles all over the State, and
the Trenton Times feels that the
Democratic Party would make a
mistake if tbey failed to nominate
Joseph Crites for Lieutentant Gov
ernor. -The Trenton Daily Times.

The Depot Proposition.
A new depot? Some of the!

and are apparently willing to go
any length seeing that this good
work continues. The people of
Monroe City are very serious in
this matter of a new depot. It is
not a ptea to get something for
nothing, for they believe that purely
from an investment standpoint it
will pay the company, while no
doubt the officers high up in the
corporation feel that it will get
just as much business from the
people ot Monroe City by retaining
the old structure, with a little vari
ation in the matter of improve
ments, as it would by the erection
of a handsome structure that would
more naturally be a source of pride
to our citizens than a dividend get
ter for the Railroad Company. We
must not reach the conclusion that
because Mr. Chittenden the Super
intendent of this division insists
that the old depot is good enough
and that by expending a few dollars
on it to make it conform to the re
quirements ot the Missouri Railroad
Commission, that we are not the
end of our. row Mr. Chittenden
is a wise man -he is a business
man. he knows how to direct men
and he knows how direct big bus
iness, and he knows more; he
knows how to look after the inter
ests of Monroe City. It is now up
to the Commercial Club and its al
lied interest? to show him. He
may not be from Missouri, but he
lives in Missouri, and is one of us
and is a n un thoroughly capable of
being shown. Oh. ye Depot Com
comiltee. keep busy. Leave na
stone unturned and see that Mon

had three children. They were at
their home in Marion. Kentucky
The two older children had visited
their parents twice during their
stay in the west, making the trip
alone. The baby was with them
until Christmas. At that time it
was thought Mrs. Guess was im
proving. Mr. Guess and baby went
to Kentucky. Soon after she took
the grippe and never recovered.
The funeral was held in Salem,
Kentucky Sunday afternoon.

biuation will insure good exhibi
tions of the National game if they
receive the support of the people.
New uniforms have been ordered.
They will be cream color with a
dark blue stripe and we have been
told they are "nifty.".
You will not be solicted for a do
nation this year but season tickets
will be sold at $3.00 each. As
they expect to have twenty or
twenty-five games here this season
you will readily see the advisability
of buying a season ticket. In all
probability there will be an exhibi
tion game in about three weeks
with the Hanuibal League Team.
There will be a meeting this
week and the line up will perhaps
be made at that time.
