have struggled for the last year to
avoid.
Nut ITtiniatiini.
The use of word ultimatum in con
nection with the document to be for
warded to Berlin is discouraged by
officials; still it w-as said the effect of
the communication would be to call
for prompt action.
The suggestion of arbitration in the
German note was met with the state
ment that the American government
would not arbitrate a question involv
ing American lives. The same state
ment was made during the Lusitania
negotiations.
Senators and representatives who
called at the White house went away
with the impression that action was
imminent but that another commun
ication would be sent to Berlin be
fore more drastic steps were taken.

Another Lull
uponVerdun
Battle Field
Paris, April 13. Another lull has
fallen on the Verdun battlefield, as the
Germans have been obliged to pause
in order to fill up the gaps in their
ranks, to replace damaged guns and
to bring up munitions preparatory to
further onslaughts. It is believed that
the French command is not likely to
modify its methods. General Petain is
said to be quite satisfied as long as
the G?rrna"ffs go ofl losing three tfrfTes
as many men as the French for unim
portant results, as he knows that he
has ample reserves to press counter at
tacks on a large scale when the op
portune time comes and stocks of am
munitions which are practically inex
haustible. Since the first month of the war the
output of three-inch shells in France
increased 33V2 times, of larger shells
44 times. Twenty-three times as many
75 millimetre guns are being made as
in August, 1914, and the manufacture
of heavy guns has increased in the
same ratio.
Calm prevailed in the whole region
of Verdun last night, this morning's
official communication says: Prepara
tion was made by the Germans for an
attack on Hill 304 but the attack was
prevented by the French from being
carried into effect. No other 'import
ant developements were reported at
the front.
DINING CAR RULE
IS UPHELD BY JURY
Clinton, Iowa, April 13. Instructing
the jury in the case of George H. Cook
against the Chicago and Northwestern
railway, in which the plaintiff asked
judgment for damages against the rail
way company for ejection from a din
ing car when he refused to don a coat,
Judge Letts ruled that the company's
rule, requiring dining car patrons to
wear coats is an unreasonable one. The
jury, however, returned a verdict for
the defense.

THE WAR TODAY
While the bhr snns 0f ne
mans are showering shells on the
region embracing the triangle
formed by Hill 304, Ksnes and Le
Mort Homme, northwest of Ver
dun, the Infantry Is idle. The
Germans evidently are holding
their infantry in leash for fresh
attacks in an endeavor to capture
these points which are barring
the way to Verdun.
There is little action around
lioiiauniont and Vaux where re
cently siirli vicious fighting has
occurred.
The British official report says
the Canadian troops haTe inflicted
heavy losses on the Germans near
St. KToi.
Both artillery and infantry at
tacks continue between the Ger
mans and Russians at various
points.
The Austrian have snffered
heavy casualties at the hands of
the Italians on the southern
slopes of .Monte Pari and Pinna

New York. April 13. Detectives
who yesterday arrested four Germans
charged with placing bombs on ships
carrying war munitions to the entente
allies today sought evidence involv
ing a "well known German" who is
alleged to have supplied a $10,000
fund to finance the fire bomb conspir
acy. They sought also the arrest of
ih .chemist v-ho-di-i- -the chemical
work in the manufacture : of the
bombs. ....... ' i j
Four employes of the" Hamburg
American line and North ' German
Lloyd Steamship companies here are
under arrest charged with attempted
arson either in making bombs or tak
ing part in the conspiracy. They are
Ernest Becker, an electrician of the
steamer Kaiser Frederick derGrosse;
Captain Charles von Kleist, superin
tendent of the New Jersey Agriculture
& Chemical company of Hoboken, N. 1
J.; Captain Otto Wolpert, superintend
ent of the Atlas line piers of the
Hamburg-American company, and
Captain Enno Bode, superintendent
of the Hamburg-American line piers
in Hoboken. i
Preparations were made to arraign
them in a Brooklyn court today to
answer the specific charge of placing
bombs in sugar bags on board the
steamer Kirk Oswald on May 2, 1915.
The steamer caught fire from bomb
explosions while on her way to Mar
seilles, France. Unexploded bombs
were found in her cargo after her ar
rival there.
Detectives asserted today that one
of the prisoners said he had been sent
to the factory in Hoboken by Captain
Franz von Papen, former military at
tache of the German embassy at Wash
ington, who was recalled at the re
quest of the United States.
The Hoboken factory was a small
structure in which a few men were
employed. One of the prisoners told
the police it was used at first to make
fertilizers for shipments to Germany
through neutral countries and that the
Germans extracted lubricating oil
from the fertilizer after its arrival in
Germany. Both Becker and von
Kleist are said by the police to have
confessed making the bombs. The
parts played by Captains Wolpert and
Bode have not been told.
Discovery of the plot was brought
about, according to the authorities of
Hoboken, through the discontent of a
man who had quarreled with the lead
ers over money payments. The Ho
boken authorities said that this man,
whose identity is withheld, told them
that Captain Boy-ed, the German na
val attache in Washington, and Cap
tain von Papen. the military attache,
had before their departure from the
United States placed a large sum of
money at the disposal of the bomb
makers.
JEWELRY WAS FIRST
CLOTHES FOLK WORE
Des Moines, Iowa, April 13. Just
as fingers came before forks, jewelry
came before clothes, according to
speakers at the convention of the Iowa
Retail Jewelers' association in ses
sion here.
Discussing the necessity of wearing
jewelry, T. L. Combs of Omaha said:
"Go back to the primitive peoples
and you will find they found it nec
essary to wear jewelry before they
found it necessary to wear clothes.
Today your cuff links are as import
ant as your shirt, your tie pin has be
come an essential and everybody hao

AMERICANS MUST ABANDON
VILLA AND EVACUATE MEXICAN SOIL
DECLARATION OF GENERAL CARRANZA
Troops Will Not Be With
drawn Is Belief of Amer
ican Officials.
ACT NOT A SURPRISE
Move Taken by Mexican Ex
ecutive Not Unexpected
Baker Is Silent.
Washington, April 13.
General Carranza's note pro
posing withdrawal of Ameri
can troops from Mexico was
delivered to Secretary Lans
ing by Eliseo Arredondo, his
ambassador, this afternoon.
Washington, April 18. General
Carranza in a note which arrived
at his embassy here early today for
presentation to Secretary Lansing
asks for the withdrawal of Amer
lean troops from .Mexico. Iliseo
Arredondo, General Carranza's
ambassador, expects to present the
note at the state department some
time daring- the day.
It raises a new issue in a situa
tion already complex, the out
come of which officials are reti
cent to predict until they have
gone over the communication care
fully and considered what reply
the United States will make.
In official quarters It was stated
that the American troops will not be
wthdrawn at this time at least, and
that while the question Is being dis
cussed with General Carranza the pur
suit of the Villa bandits will be rushed
with renewed vigor.
Secretary Baker of the war depart
ment si id he was unable to comment
upon General Cirranza's note because
it raised questions of adminstration
policy entirely within the jurisdiction
of the president and the state depart
ment. Although General Carranza raised
side issues, administration officials at
their first view of the communication
regarded the principal contention as
being that the object of the punitive
expedition has been accomplished so
far as it can be and that the Villa
bandits have been dispersed.
ote 'ot a Surprise.
War department officials take the
view that they have no evidence that
the Villa bands have been dispersed
because they never had definite infor
mation of their number and that the
very nature of the situation gives no
evidence that the raiders have been ex
terminated. Some state department
officials confessed that General Car
ranza's note was not a surprise.
Counsellor Polk confirmed the state
ment in the note that when he asked
for use of the Mexican railways the
reply was "satisfactory" but was
coupled with an expression of sur
prise that the United States had not
awaited final approval of the pending
protocol before sending troops across
the border.
Opens Path (o Action.
It was declared officially, however,
that no formal protest against the
entry of General Pershing's columns
had been previously made by General
Carranza. When the advance troops
crossed at Columbus, it was officially
stated, a Carranza general met them
at the border and made no protest
either personally or on behalf of his
government.
State department officials took the
view that General Carranza's note was
not a demand for immediate with
drawal of the forces, but an invitation
to begin negotiations to limit their
stay.
Counsellor Polk conferred with
Major General Scott, chief of staff and
announced that the negotiations would
be handled exclusively by Secretary
Lansing.
Expedition Justified.
The dispatch of the punitive expedi
tion before negotiation of the protocol
was characterized by state department
officials at "perfectly justified" by the
correspondence between Secretary
Lansing and the Carranza govern
ment. Senator Lodge, ranking republican
or tne toreign relations committee,
called at the navy department today,
but said his visit was not in reference
to the Mexican situation. He declined
to comment on the Carranza note and
would not forecast the attitude of the
senate republicans.
"The administration 1b charged with
our foreign affairs," said he.
Chairman Stone refused to comment
and communicated with the state de
partment.

EXPEDITION NOT
IN MUCH DANGER
Precautions HaTe Been Taken to In
sure Against Possibility of
Troops Being Ensnared.
Washingon, April 13. Attorney
General Gregory responding to Sen
ator Kenyon's resolution calling for
the results of the department of jus
tice endeavored to provide against
possibilities although strictest secrecy
has been observed. It Is understood
that injvery movement of troops be
yond the border and along the inter
national line the possibility of an at
tempt to cut off the expedition has
been considered and the war depart
ment Is prepared to back up the forces
should need arise.
Some officials privately expressed
the view that General Carranza might
have felt compelled to propose the
withdrawal of troops in deference to
public sentiment In Mexico.
It was pointed out that his note pro
posed only opening of negotiations to
that end. Itgeemed likely today that
a more or less prolonged diplomatic
discussion was-ioreshadowed rather
than troop movements.
DOUBT CENTERS
ABOUT GUAYMAS
Washington, April 13. Dispatches
received early today at the navy de
partment from Admiral Winslow, com
manding the Pacific fleet, made no
mention of a reported bandit raid upon
Americans near Guaymas. Admiral
Winslow reported arrival of the cruis
er Denver at La Paz, Mexico, enroute
to San Diego. He did not mention or
dering the Denver to Guaymas to in
vestigate the alleged attack upon the
Americans and no orders have been
sent from the navy department to that
effect.
Admiral Winslow stated that the
supply ship Glacier was bringing a
number of Americans from Mazatlan.
GEN, FUNSTON TO
CONTINUE HUNT?
San Antonio, Texas, April 13. Until
General Funston receives orders from
Washington, no change will be made
in the conduct of the campaign
against Francisco Villa. It was un
derstood that unofficial information ot
Carranza's request was sent to Gen
eral Pershing today but on account of
his location far at the front it was
believed improbable that he would
receive it before tonight or tomorrow.
The news sent to him, however, was
nothing more than that contained in
press dispatches and was not accom
panied by any orders.

CHASE OF
Head of De Facto Govern.
ment Sends Note to
United States.
ALL WRONG HE SAYS
Argues That Forces Were
Sent Into Country With
out Permission. . '
Mexico City, April 18-The
Mexican government has sent to
its ambassador In Washington a
note to be delivered at 10 o'clock
this morning to Secretary Lansing
asking that the American troops
be withdrawn from Mexican ter
ritory and that the pursuit of
Villa he left to the Mexican con
stitutionalist army.
The Mexican note contains about
five thousand words. In it the de
facto government of Mexico contends
that, as the American troops crossed
Into Mexico without permission, they
should be withdrawn until a proper
formal compact can be entered into
between the two governments. It is
insistently affirmed that the previous
notes of the Mexican government es
pecially emphasized the fact that per
mission for reciprocal crossing of the
frontier would be granted only In the
event of the repetition of a raid sim
ilar to that made by Villa at Colum
bus, N. M.
Dlsocetrpation Asked.
The note was sent t Eliseo Arre-
dondo, the Carranza representative in
Washington, with instructions for ita
delivery to Secretary Lansing, "so
ending negotiations for a reciprocal
passing of troops and asking for 'dis
occupation of the territory occupied
by American troops in view of Villa's
party having been destroyed."
Throughout the note emphasis in
laid on the fact that the American ex
pedition was undertaken under a mis
understanding. Although acting in
good faith, the declaration is made
that the United States had Interpreted
the Srst note of the de facto govern
ment as effecting a definite agreement
between the two nations. But the in
tention of the de facto government
was that no expedition should be sent
Into Mexico until terms and conditions
relative to an agreement were de
fined. Would Suspend Ifegotlattons.
The note declares therefore that in
consequence of no final agreement
having been readied as to the terms
of the treaty to regulate the recip
rocal passage of troops over the di
viding line, "the Mexican government
judges It convenient to suspend for
the present all discussion or negotia
tions in this particular, or founded on
the circumstances that the expedition
sent by the United States government
to pursue Villa, is without foundation
in virtue of the non-existence of a
previous agreement, formal and defi
nite." What was intended by the note of
March 10, it is pointed out, was to
submit a proposal "by means ot which
the forces of one and the other country
could reciprocally cross the dividing
line in pursuit of bandits If unfortun
ately there should be repeated along
the border acts like those committed
In Columbus."
The note adds, however:
"From the beginning the Mexican
government Judged that by reason pf
the time which had transpired and
for the purpose of treating a case al
ready passed, the said incident could
not continue as a proposal for the re
ciprocal passage of troops."
The fact that the United States had

J. P. WEDDINGS ARE
REGARDED AS LEGAL
Chicago, April 13. Some hundreds
of couples in Chicago and adjoining
towns will be interested to know that
they are legally married, as the result
of a decision handed down yesterday
by Judge Hugo Pam of the appellate
court. Judge Pam's decision holds
that marriages performed by Justices
of the peace are legal, thus overruling
a decision rendered in 1914 by Judge
A. J. Petit that such marriages were
Illegal. A number of the couples mar
ried by Justices of the peace prior to
Judge Petit's ruling were remarried,
while many others continued to be
lieve they were married legally by the
justices.
Judge Pam's decision says that the
municipal court depriving justices of
Jurisdiction in Chicago does not dis
turb their statutory right to officiate
at weddings.
