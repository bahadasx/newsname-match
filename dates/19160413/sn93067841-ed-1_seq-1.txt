COUNTY CONVENTIONS TO ASSEMBLE
AT VARIOUS COUNTY
SEATS MONDAY, MAY 1.
Columbia, April 10:?In accordance
with the direct primary law passed
by the General Assembly at its session
in 1915 the Democratic voters
of South Carolina will meet in their
respective club places on or before
* the fourth Saturday in April and
elect delegates to the county conventions,
which assemble in the various
county seats the first Monday in May.
The dubs will elect officers and one
delegate to the county convention for
every twenty-five voters or majority
fraction thereof,based upon the number
of votes polled in the first pri
mary of 1914.
Tbe clubs will also elect a member
to represent them upon the county
Democratic executive committee.
The rules governing the Democratic
party as drawn up" by the
State convention in 1911 were enacted
into law at the session of the
General Assembly in 1915. This puts
it beyond the power of the coming
State convention to amend or modi-1
fn fV?Q ovisfinor nrnvi?innsnf the nres
XJ VllV VAigvttifs f/tv.*v.w.wv. w..? ,
ent rules and regulations of the
party. However.it does not preclude
adopting additional rules and regu
latioLS which are not in conflict with
the statute law.
The principal features of the law
governing organization of the clubs
for the primaries every two years
provide that each voter must sign his j
full name on the club rolls. The j
personal enrollment provision is con-1
sid' *^d one of the strongest safegi
?rd8 Of the primary, and though
its adoption created strong opposition.
it is now an accepted principle
of the party and its wisdom was justified
in its workings two years ago.
The county conventions will meet I
at noon the first Monday in May at
the various county seats, organize,
elect the county chairman, choose
J fA Qtoto nnntron H r?n
Utjt"X^CCS IU lllb t^buwv VVUTVUVIVH
and elect a member of the State
Democratic executive committee.
The county conventions will also
transact such other matters as may
be of interest to the various counties.
Each county is entitled to twice as
Vmany delegates as it has representation
in the General Assembly.
The Democratic State convention
will meet in the hall of the House of
Representatives Wednesday,May 17,
at noon. It will be called to order
by John Gary Evans, chairman of
the State Democratic executive com~The
nnnvpntirm will be com
muvc^. auv VVM . _ _
posed of 336 delegates.
The main business before the conw
vention will be the election of four
delegates at large to the national
Democratic convention in St Louis,
the election of a member of the national
Democratic executive committee,a
position now held by United
States Senator B R Tillman,the elec\

tion of a State chairman, now held
by former Governor John Gary Ev-1
ans, and the making of such rules
and regulations governing the party
primaries and the conduct of the J
campaign as it may see fit.
The delegates from the various I
Congressional districts will caucus!
during the day and elect two delegates
from each district to the St
Louis convention. This will give
I South Carolina 18 voces in cne na!
tional Democratic gathering:.
The fight to abolish the county-tocounty
canvass of the candidates will
be one of the main struggles to come
before the State convention. If the
canvass is not abolished there is every
reason to believe that it will be
safeguarded and amended.
The complexion of the"Big Four"
to St Louis is beginning to attract
some attention. It is customary to
9end the two United States Senators
and the Governor. The names of
Senators Tillman and Smith,Governor
Manning, former Governor John
Gary Evans, State Warehouse Commissioner
John L McLaurin, former
Governor Cole L Blease, Christie
Benet, Senator Alan Johnstone, Congressman
Lever, R Goodvvyn Rhett.
of Charleston,president of the United
States Chamber of Commerce; Solicitor
Robert A Cooper, former Gov
ernor M F Ansel, are among mose
mentioned for the delegates at large
to the national Democratic convention.
South Carolina will undoubtedly
instruct for President Wood row Wilson,
and his administration will he
heartily endorsed by the Palmetto
Democrats. As this was one of the
original Wilson States, the South
Carolina Democrats will be given a
place of honor at St Louis.
With the club meetings only two
weeks off,general apathy on the part
of the people is the outstanding feature
of the general situation. The
indifference has never been more
noticeable, and it seems now as if
the organization of the clubs and the
conventions will be purely formal
affairs and there will be an entire
avoidance of anything like factional
contests or partisan proceedings.

E McCants, of the Earles section,
which occurred Friday afternoon.
For three years or more Mr McCants
hoon a Siiffprpr from drODSV.

friends for support several appeals
were made through this paper in his

thirty years of age, was industrious,
and a hard worker before he was
