the American troops would not be
withdrswn at present, and while the

suit of Villa will be continued with
renewed vigor.
Although Carrania raised some side
issues, the administration officlslt-j

waa that the punitive expeditions ob
ject has been accomplished, as far -as
it could be, and that the Villistss had
beer dispersed. The war department
officials say they have no evidence that
tho bandit banda have been extermi
nated. State department officiate took the
view of the note to limit the Ameri
