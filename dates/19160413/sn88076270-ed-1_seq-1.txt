FARMER INTERESTED IN HIS
TORY OF LEADERS OF NON
PARTISAN LEAGUE
A meeting of the Non Partisan
League was held in the court house
in Williston last week. It was my
privilege to attend that meeting and
listen to the speeches. Owning a half
section of land and operating it I
naturally was vitally interested in
the questions under discussion. In
a state like ours with 75 per cent of
the population actively engaged In
tilling the soil it seems and is reason
able to demand that a fair majority
of the legislative bodies of this state
should come from the farm. The ter
minal elevator proposition has our
indorsement but we don't agree with
the speaker who said that the loca
tion of that terminal was a matter
of little consequence. We think it
matters much. Certainly the farm
ers of this country should dictate the
price of the produce of their farm.
Not how much will you give me for
my potatoes, my hogs, my grain, etc.,
but I want so much. Think, if you
can, of a doctor, an attorney or mer
chant asking a farmer how much
they will give them for their services
or wares. In the language of the
street, "nothing doing." I think,
however, we should be a little care
ful. The history of all movements
resembles the swing of a pendulun.
Often times men are carried away
with their enthusiasm. Many of us
have invested money in this League
and the leaders have used our money.
We are placing a lot of confidence in
these leaders. I wonder how many of
us have taken the pains to look these
men up. They told us they were the
chosen of God. If they are going to
take the yoke off our neck and the
burden from our back and lead us out
of the land of bondage into a good
land and sweet we better make sure
thst our confidence will not be dis
placed. For my part I should like to
show something of the past life of the
leaders of this league. What

League Meeting
Held On Tuesday
The regular meeting of the Civic
League was held at the home of Mrs.
Vohs on Tuesday evening, with Mrs.
Vohs and Mrs. Aaen as hostesses.
A splendid six o'clock dinner was
served. The tables were beautifully
decorated with pink carnations.
Twenty members and four invited
guests were present.

absolute extermination.

BIRDS WHICH ARE SHOT FOR
SPORT ARE BIG BENEFIT
TO STATE
Hannaford, N. D., April 6.'—North
Dakota hunters this year may be
forced to forego the shooting of large
numbers of prairie chickens, snipe
and other birds which have been prey
in the past to the bag and gun of the
expert nimrod, and take up the target
practice or other form of divertise
ment dear to the heart of every "gun
ner."
Owing to the almost complete de
struction of prairie chicken eggs by
frost, the Manitoba government has
decided to take steps to preserve
these birds from extermination this
year and is arranging with authori
ties of North Dakota for joint action
in regard to plover, snipe, woodcock
and sandpipers whose activities
would secure the country an anual
loss of $80,000,000 from weeds and
insects.

As a result of the warmer weather
there have been many washouts on

the little Muddy was the real thing
in the way of a river. North of the

SSUES LETTERS TO
BETTER FARM AGENT HALL IS
SUES TIMELY LETTER TO FAR
MERS REGARDING WORK
Williston, N. D., April 12, 1916.
Sir:—
At the opening of the 1916 season,
there are a few things I would like
to call to your attention.
A great many acres of sweet clover
are to be seeded in Williams county
this season. This crop is still an ex
periment with us. We do not know
exactly how it should be seeded or
the rate to seed. Yellow flowered may
be as good as white flowered. This
remains to be determined by exper
ience. Do not invest too much in the
crop. Try different rates and meth
ods of seeding. Five pounds per acre
may be too light and ten pounds too
heavy. We believe the Correct rate
to seed is probably eight to ten
pounds. There are two things that
we are sure of with sweet clover. One
is that it must have a firm seed bed
the other that being a small seed it
to one inch deep.
Kindly let me. know if you are try
ing sweet clover so that we can have
the benefit of your experience for the
whole county. We can tell more
about sweet clover after we have seen
results in this county for two seasons.
If you have a piece of alfalfa seed
ed last year, 1915, rake the weeds off
the first thing this spring and cross
drag it with a common drag. Do not
disc it. Later in the season cultivate
it between the rows. Do not plow up
alfalfa even though it looks poor. It
will syrprise you in its growth, and
as a rule come out good. Advise me
early if you want help in seeding al
falfa. If you are seeding Grimm, be
sure it is Grimm. I can help.you sell
seed from it if we are sure that it is
Grimm.

NAKED MAN WAS

TRACK CLAD IN HABILIMENTS
OF EDEN ONLY
Glasgow, Mont., April 10.—Report
was brought to this city yesterday by
delayed No. 2 of the killing of a man
a few miles west of Chinook yester
day morning.
As the train was running a little
late between Yantic and Chinook and
was making pretty good speed, the
engineer saw a stark naked figure run
ning down the middle of the track'
ahead of the train. An effort was
made to stop the train, but they struck
the man before this could be accom
plished, and the body was thrown to
one side of the track, where it was
picked up by the train crew a few
moments later.
On examination the body proved to
be a stranger weighing about 200
pounds, and he was barefooted and did
not have a stitch of clothes about him,
nor could any wearing apparel be
found along the track in the vicinity

See Child Welfare
Exhibit Saturday
The fact that many parents have
not a great deal to spend for nursery
equipment is no reason why a baby
may not be provided with all the com
forts necessary to his well being. If
you are interested in seeing arrange
ments that other mothers have found
practical in caring for small children,
and apparatus to amuse them, be sure
to see the Child Welfare Exhibit at
I. O. O. F. hall Saturday afternoon,
April 15. There will be a display of
garments of the most approved type,
and all the other various articles that
meet the needs of an up-to-date baby.
There will be an exhibit of home play
that may solve for you the problem
of keeping little folks amused with
things woVth while. It is hoped that
the exhibit will prove of value to
those who wish to better their home
surroundings. Some interesting liter
ature has been secured from various
sources and will be distributed in con
nection.

CANADA HAS A DIG
FORCE AT THE FRONT
S I O S A N S O I E S
FROM DOMINION FIGHTING
IN FRANCE
Otta, April 6.—A memorandum
summarizing the work of the depart
ment of militia in connection with the
war during the past twelve months
was presented to parliament by Sir
Robert Borden as a preliminary to
the request which will come in a day
or so for the voting of $250,000,000 to
provide the sinews of war for the
coming financial year.
Perhaps the most interesting infor
mation given is. that Canada had act
ually at the front on March 18 last,
about 60,000 troops, or practically
three complete divisions. Also, in
England or in passage to England on
that date there were 44,000 troops.
In Canada, there were 134,000
troops.
Of the 14,000 troops in England,
about half are at Shorncliffe as one
training division under Brigadier Gen
eral J. C. MacDougal while another
training division is at Bramshott nt
der Brigadier General Lord Brooke.

is intended as soon as the weath
er permits, to concentrate the men
in training in Canada at seven camps
for the summer, namely, at London,
at Niagara, at Petawawa (with a de
tachment at Barriefield), at Valcar
tier (including the Quebec and the
Maritime Provinces men), at Camp
Hughes, Man., at Vernon, B. C., and
at the Sarcee Reserve in Alberta, near
Calgary.
The housing of the troops in Can
ada for the winter months cost a total
of $853,130, while for the housing of
guards, prisoners of war, the estab
lishing of convalescent homes, etc.,
the cost was $147,135.
COMMISSIONERS HAVE BUSY
SESSION
The Board of County Commission
ers have had a very busy session this
month and are still at work. The re
cent floods which damaged a number
of bridges has given them some, addi
tional work this week but they expect
to adjourn in a day of two to meet
again toward the last of May.

SELLS CONTROL DEVICE
TO OUR GOVERNMENT
YOUNG INVENTOR SELLS TOR
PEDO' CONTROL SECRET TO
UNCLE SAM FOR $750,000*
Washington, April 10.—For $750,V
000 a young American inventor is
about to surrender to Uncle Sam air
the patents and the exclusive right:
to the use of a device by which a tor
pedo can be launched against a bat
tleship of an enemy and so directed'
and controlled by radio dynamic
forces either from shore or from
aeroplane as to insure its striking its
mark at a maximum distance of 28
miles.
John Hays Hammond, Jr., of Glou
cester, Mass., the wizard son of John-.
Hays Hammond, mining engineer, is.
the inventor and owner of 218 patents
which will be turned over to the gov
ernment.
Although only 28 years old, young
Hammond has accomplished what
many of the military scientists of oth
er countries have tried to perfect and
failed.
He alone possesses the secret, and
if congress accepts his offer he will'1
reveal it only to those designated by.
the government.
Committee Approve Purchase
Mr. Hammond has also stipulated'
that in addition to turning over all'
rights to his patents he will devote
his time gratis to co-operating in in
stalling the apparatus.
Discovery that the government ir
willing to pay young Hammond a
fortune for his invention was made
I with the introduction in the house of
the fortifications bill. The sum of
I $750,000 was approved as a fair
price, both by military officials and
subcommittees.
There is the authoritative state
ment that Hammond refused to sell
his invention for a fabulous sum to
one of the European countries now
at war, explaining to the old world
bidder that no amount would tempt
him to give them the preference over
his native land.
Hammond Spent $300,000
When it became known Mr. Ham
mond had expended $300,000 in per-
fecting his device and had labored
continuously on it for eight years, the
sum he asked was considered reason
able.
Four years ago he discovered the
principle for which all had been
searching. For two years he exper-
