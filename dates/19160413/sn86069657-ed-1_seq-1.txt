Tho writer attended the Intorcollct
giate Prohibition Association conven
tion in Lexington last week where he
heard some very fine addresses against
tho liquor trade Tho render will re
ceive the benefits of these addresses
from time to time. Suffice it to say
the liquor business, is doomed and tho
writer hopes to havo a hand in putting
it out of business. To take n look at
tho drunken mess of men and boys at
the box supper last Saturday night
was enough to arouse tho fighting
blood of every loyul and sober citizen
of Stanton. And tho shame of it is
that uraliy of tho fathers of Stanton
have set the example before their boys
and these samo boys are fast becoming
the drunkards of our town.
Mrs. Mineryn Abner, wife of Tilford

The sympathy of tho community goes
out to the bereaved family.
Mrs. Lith Barnes has moved ihto tho

doubtful.
Itev. J. W. Tyler of Danville, Ky

and the writer would be glad to see

sober man for this office, rather than

race he would be about tho hardest

G. V. Lyle, the hustling busi
ness man of Furnace, was in
town Monday, and paid us a
pleasant visit. Mr. Lyle s:iys
that, the oil boom is making
things hum in the Furnace neigh
borhood, and if they only had
some roads to travel on it would
be much better.
The unefiicial report of the
vote on tlte 40,000 road bond
ifsue Monday shows that tho
question carried by a majority of
805; These figures may be
changed somewhat by the official
county, but there will be very
little difference in them. Tho
vote was light, only 817 votes
beiug cast, against 1180 cast in
the last general election last fall.
Foil wing is the vote by precincts:

Those who worked so hard for
the passage of the 'bond issue are
to be congratulated for their suc
cess and they certainly deserve
every word of praise that can be
given them. In the lower end
of the county, Mr. J. W. Mcin

the question, did valuable service
while Dr. I. V. Johnson, of
Stanton, looked after the matter
in the upper end. There were,
of course, many others who help,
ed greatly in the work, but wo
fell that to those three men is
due the largest measure of credit.
Now all that remains, is for tho
Fiscal Court, when they continue
their adjourned meeting on
April 20, to proceed with tho
preparations for issuing and
selling the bonds and letting tho
contracts for tho work.
