Speaker Declares Want of
Battle Efficiency Due to
, Lack of Direction.
Washington. D C, April 13. To the
lack of a general naval staff was at
tributed the unpreparedness of the
American navy and lu want of battle
efficiency, by E. K. Roden, of Scranton.
Pa., in an address at today's session of
the Navy League of the United States.
Mr. Roden declared that with an ap
propriation no greater than that ex
pended by the United States, Germany
has built up a navy 30 percent greater
in combined units and more modern in
construction, and this he attributed to
the fact that the German navy is
headed "by a tried out, efficient gen
eral staff."
lie asserted that although "during
the past IE years congress has appro
priated more than $1,500,000,000 for the
navy, a sum greatly in excess of that
by anv other power except Great Brit
ain, yet at the present time our navy
is rated as a fourth class power."
The speaker said that the act of con
gress of last year creating1 the office
of chief of naval operations has pro
vided "only a skeleton of a form,
stripped of all substance."

NEW YORK, April 13 Detectives
who on Wednesday arrested
four Germans charged with
placing bombs on ships carrying -war
munitions to the entente allies, today
sought evidence involving a "well
known German" who Is alleged to have
supplied a 310,000 fund to finance the
fire and bomb conspiracy. They sought
also the arrest of the chemist who did
the chemical work in the manufacture
of the bombs. The name of neither
of these men has yet been revealed by
the police.
Four employes of the Hamburg
American line and North German
Lloyd steamship companies here are
under arrest, charged with attempted

while on her way to Marseilles.
France Unexploded bombs were
found in her cargo after her arrival
there.
Relieve Responsible for 35 Fire.
Police captain Thomas Tunney, who
has charge of the case, regards the
arrest of the four prisoners as the
most important stride yet made In the
detection of a great conspiracy to
destroy steamships sailing with war
munitions from New York, Boston,
Phlladelohia and Seattle.
The police believe the men Involved
have been responsible for fires on at
least 33 steamers that have caused
34,000,000 damage. They assert they
have evidence that bombs made in a
Hoboken factory ostensibly operated
for the manufacture of fertilizer were
sent to all parts of the country. The
use to which they were put other than
for the destruction of steamers has
not been disclosed.
One Sent by German Attache
Detectives asserted today that one
of the prisoners said he had been sent
to the factory In Hoboken by Capt.
Franz von Papen, former military at
tache of the German embassy at
Washington, who was recalled at the
request of the United States.
The Hoboken factor' was a small
structure In which a few men were
employed. One of the prisoners told
the police it was used at first to mal-
fertilizer for shipment to Germany
through neutral countries and that the
Germans extracted lubricating oil from
tne fertilizer alter its arrival in iier
many. Claim Two Have Confessed.
Both Becker and von Kleist are said
by the police to have confessed making
the bombs. The parts played by Capts.
Wolpert and Bode have not been told.
Discovery of the plot was brought
about, according to the authorities of
Hoboken, through the discontent of a
man who had auarreled with the lead
ers over money payments. The Ho
boken authorities said that this man,
whose Identity is withheld, told them
that Capt Boy-Ed, the German naval
attache in Washington, and Capt. von
Papen, the military attache, had be
fore their departure from the United
States placed a large eum of money
at the disposal of the bomb makers.
Turned Ihrr to V. S.
The four prisoners were taken from
police headquarters to the office of
district attorney Cropsey, of Brooklyn,
for prosecution in that district, but
after a consultation between the de
tectives in charge and Mr. Cropsey,
It was decided to turn them over to
the custody of the department of jus
tice. Accordingly they were taken to
the headquarters of the department,
after which a conference was hold
with federal district attorney Marshall
as to what disposition should be made
of them.

Lull at Verdun While At
tackers Bring Up More
Men and Artillery.
Paris, France. April 13. Another lull
has fallen on the Verdun battlefield,
as the Germans have been obliged to
pause In order to fill up the gaps in
their ranks, to replace damaged guns
and to bring up munitions preparatory
to further onslaughts. It is believed
that the French command is not likely
to modify Its methods. Gen. Petain is
said to be quite satisfied as long as
the Germans go on losing three times
aa many men as the French for unim
portant reasons, as he knows that hs
has ample reserves to press a counter
attack on a large scale when the op
portune time comes, and stocks of am
munition which are practically inex
haustible. Since the first month of the-war the
output of three inch shells in France
Increased 33 1-3 times, of larger shells
4i times. Twenty-three times as many
76-milllmetre guns are being made as
in August, 1914, and the manufacture
of heavy guns has increased In the
same ratio.
Calm prevailed in the whole region
of Verdun Wednesday night, this
morning's official communication says.
Preparation was made by the Germans
for an attack on hill No. 304. but the
attack was prevented by the French
from being carried into effect No
other important developments were re
ported at the front.
German Attack Beaten.
The German general attack on the
left bank of the Meuse, which began
on Sunday, is regarded as having been
beaten and the Germans have reverted
to the previous relatively small alter
nate strokes against the French posi
tions on both sides of the river and to
artillery operations. Only frontal at
tacks under difficulties were possible,
except at Dead Man's hill, where tlj
German, wereable-ta .atUeic through
the ravines.
They tried to force a passage be
tween Dead Man's hill and Cumieres
and to work around the south of the
hill In order to envelop it. After two
days of hard fighting this maneuver
iatiea ana witn it is cellared to have
collapsed the main idea of that par
ticular German attack.
The military observers point out that
Gen. Petain once more has succeeded
with a minimum of wastage in beating
off with heavy loss the adversary's at
tack, thereby increasing the morale of
the army and enhancing his own repu
tation. trict court to indictments involving

The War At a Glance
THE attacks on Verdun have
subsided for the moment after
several days of particularly
severe fighting. There were no en
gagements of Importance in that
region last night, tho official
French statement of this afternoon
says.
The principal German effort
since the general Verdun offensive
was begun Sunday has been the
attempt to force a passage between
Dead Man's Hill and Cumieres for
the purpose of enveloping the hilL
Some French trenches in this vi
cinity were carried, but the main
positions of the defenders were
held. Paris regards the operations
of the week as having resulted
decidedly to the advantage of the
French.
On the eastern front. Russian at
tacks have not seriously shaken
the German lines and although
spirited fighting is still in progress
at various points, the offensive
movement apparently la subsiding.
The Russian sailing vessel Im
perator. on a voyage from Gulfport,
Mississippi, for Marseilles, has been
torpedoed in the Mediterranean.
Nine of the orew, some of them
wounded, have been landed at Bar

BRITISHlFEl
Washington D C, April 1 J "The
present war ha- shown." says the note
from Great Britain justifying her-conduct
in remoWng belligerents from the
American ship China, "that the bellig
erent activity of the enemies of this
country Is by no means confined to the
actual theaters of military and naval
operations and that there is no limit to
the methods of which Germany in par
ticular seeks to secure a victory for
her arms. The hostile efforts of the
enemy have shown and continue to
show themselves on neutral soil in
many parts of the world in political
intrigues, revolutionary plots, schemes
for attacking .the sea trade of this
country, and her allies, endeavors to
facilitate the operations of ships en
gaged in this task and in criminal re
prisals of different kinds directed
against the property of neutrals and
belligerents alike."
The note refers in general terms to
neutral plots in the United States par
ticularly the Fay case.
The note charges that Germans in
Shanghai were engaged in plots and
that when discovered, they were plan

The Troops Will Remain In
Mexico, Pending Negoli-
alions With Carranza.
CARRANZANOTE
GIVEN TOLANSING
War Department Is Prepared
To Back Up Field Forces
If Need Should Arise.
WASHINGTON, D. C. April 13.
Despite the demand of Gen.
Carranza for the withdrawal oC
American troops from Maxieo, Ameri
can administration officials were in ap
parent agreement today that the troopa
will remain In Mexico for the present,
but that from a diplomatic standpoint
it might be tetter not to risk local
clashes with Carranza forces while ne
gotiations are in. progress.
Moreover, it was aaid military pru
dence would necessitate balding the
advance columns close to- supporting
fqrepsv. until the attitude ox me ;nexi
eaTn "troopa about them was definitely;
Known.
Future Is Provided For.
It waB also increasingly evident to
day that the war department has en
deavored to provide against possibili
ties, although strictest secrecy has
been oUeerved. It is understood that
the war department is prepared to baclc
up the forces should need arise.
Some officials privately expressed the,
view that Gen. Carranza might have
felt compelled to propose the with
drawal of troops in deference to publia
sentiment in Mexico. It seemed likely
today that a more or less prolonged
diplomatic discussion was foreshad
owed. Gen. Carranza's note was delivered to
secretary of state Lansing by Eliseo
Arredondo, Mexican ambassador, this
afternoon.
No Serious Friction Expected,
The proposal failed to bring from
administration sources today any in
dication that the situation was expect
ed to result In any serious friction with
the de facto government In Mexico.
The development, not unexpected,
was received in congress with diver
gent views, but a general undertone o
caution and a disposition to leave the
situation, in its present stage, to the
administration prevailed.
MUunilerstamllnc In Mexico.
Late today secretary of state Lans
ing said the Carranza note gave evi
dence that there was some misunder
standing in Mexico. Some of its state
ments, as published, did not agree with,
the eecrtary"s recollection of the pre
liminary negotiations. He said the
United States recognized the right of
Mexico to ask withdrawal of the troops
but that the government considered
that the agreement under which they
entered still wdS.ln force
New Issue Raised.
The note raises a new issue In a
situation already much complex, the
outcome of which officials are reticent
to predict until they have gone over
the communication carefully.
Secretary of war Baker said he was
unable to comment upon Gen. Car
ranza's note because it raised questions
of administration policy entirely with
in the jurisdiction of the president and
the state department.
llnndlt Dlaperaed, Mexican View.
Although Gen. Carranza raised side
issues, administration officials, at their
first view of the communication, re
garded the principal contention as be
ing that the object of the punitive n
peditton has been accomplished, so far
as it can be. and that the Villa bands
have been dispersed.
AVnihlngton Doesn't Agree.
War department officials take the
view that they have no evidence that
the Villa bands have been dispersed,
because they never had definite in
formation of their number and that the
very nature of the situation gives no
evidence that the raiders have been
exterminated.
Note I No Surprise.
Some state department officials con
fessed that Gen. Carranza's note was
not a surprise.
Counselor Polk confirmed the state
ment in the note that when he asked
for use of the Mexican railways the
reply was "satisfactory." But was
coupled with an expression of surprise
that the United States had not awaited
final approval of the pending protocol
before sending troops across the
border.
No Preilou Protest
It was declared, officially, however,
that no formal protest against the en
try of Gen. Pershing's columns had
been made previously by Gen. Car
ranza. When the advance troops
crossed at Columbus, it was officially
stated, a Carranza genera) met them
at the border and made ho protest,
either personally or on behalf of his
government.
Mere Imitation For Negotiations.
State department officials took the
Mew that Gen. Carranza's note was
nut a demand for the immediate wlth-
