and the 3rd instant, regarding the

neer, Englishman, Berwindale and
Eagle Point, that the mentioned cases
in accordance with our note of the
30th and 31st ultimo, and the 4th and
5th inst have been subjected to care
ful investigation by the admiral staff
ot the navy, which have led to the
following results
Berwindale Affair.
FirstThe English steamer Ber
windale A steamer which was pos
siblv the Berwindale was encountered
on the evening of March 16 on the
Irish coast by a German submarine.
The steamer, as soon as she noticed
the submarine, which was running
unsubmeiged, turned and steamed
avvaj She was ordered to halt by a
warning shot She paid no attention
but extinguished all lights and at
tempted to escape.
Second The British steamer Eng
lishman Tins steamer, on March 24,
was iailed upon to halt by a German
siibmai me thiough two warning
shots about 20 sea miles west of Is
la (Hebrides
"Atter the German commandant
had convinced himself that the crew
had taken to the boats and rowed
from the ship, he sank the steamer.
Attack Doubtful.
"ThudThe British steamer Man
chester It is impossible to establish
through the investigation up to the
present, whether the attack on this
-toame which, according to the giv
description, occurred on March
11 in the latitude of Waterford, is
attributed to a German submarine.
"FourthThe British steamer
Eagle Point This steamer in the
iorenoon of March 28 was called up
on to halt by a German submarine
through signal and shot, about 100
knots, 130 sea miles from the south
west coast of Ireland, but proceeded.

Sussex Affair.
"FifthThe French steamer Sus
sex Ascertainment of the fact
hether the channel steamer Sussex
was damaged by a German submar
ine was rendered extremely difficult
because no exact details of time,
place and appendant circumstances
of the sinking were known.
"In the general region between
Folkestone and Dieppe, on March 24
last, a craft without a flag, having a
giay funnel, small grey forward
works and two high masts, was en
countered about the middle of the
English channel by a German sub
marine The commander reached the
definite conclusion that it was a war
vessel, and indeed a mine layer of the
recently built Arabis class.
"Consequently he attacked the ves
sel at 3:55 in the afternoon, middle
European time The torpedo struck
and caused such a violent explosion
in the forward part of the ship that
the entire forward par was torn
away to the bridge.
"The Geman commander made a
sketch of the vessel attacked by him,
two drawings of which are enclosed.
"A comparison of the Sussex and
the picture of the steamer Sussex
shows that the craft attacked is not
identical with the Sussex the differ
ence in the position of the stack and

SUPPLY OF LABOR AND
MATERIAL NOT ENOUGH
The main characteristics which
have been noted in the business sit
uation in recent months are un
changed, except \o show signs of
greater intensity as spring comes on
and the period of more active out
door operations is at hand, according
to the monthly letter issued by the
Security State bank of Bemidji. The
letter states that there is not enough
of materials or labor for all the work
that the country would like to have
done, and the result, of course, is
that the requirements which are most
pressing and can afford to outbid the
others will be served first, and the
others will await their turn. There
is a large distribution of merchan
dise and retailers instead of buying
for immediate wants only are en
deavoring to cover their wants for
some time to come

Troops lines of Communica

BULLETIN
San Antonio, April 13.Late
dispatches indicate plainly that
Carranza soldiers participated
in attacking the American troops
marching through Parral.
Washington, April 13.The United
States officials were brought face to
face with a serious situation today
by a communication from Carranza's
secretary of state to Secretary Lan
sing, requesting that the United
States withdraw its forces from. Mex
ican territory.
The Mexican ambassador declined
to discuss the note but stated that
the official text was being translated
and would be delivered to the state
department when translated.
Won't Agree.
Washington, April 13.A high ad
ministrative official today told the
United Press that the United States
would not be willing to agree to Car
ranza's demands and take the United
States troops from Mexico.
Situation Critical.
El Paso, April 13.Army officers
consider the situation in Mexico as
the most critical since the Villa hunt
began. There is much danger that
the lines of communication will be
cut. The communication lines are
400 miles long and the guard is in
adequate. Troops are suffering from
the lack of proper colthing and with
the rainy season coming on the Am
ericans must have free use of the
Mexican railways or be foreed to
withdraw from Mexico.
No Official Word.
San Antonio, April 13.General
Funston considers the punitive ex
pedition is not a military success un
til Villa is captured or killed. Offi
cial word about the Carranza request
for evacuation has not been re
ceived here.
Not an Ultimatum.
Washington, April 13.The Mex
ican embassy claims that the Car
ranza note is in no sense an ultima
tum or demand on the United States
to withdraw the troops. It is char
acterized as merely a request for
negotiations looking toward a with
drawal.
Americans Shot At.
San Antonio, April 13.American
consular dispatches state that Mex
ican citizens at Parral fired a number
of shots at the American troops when
they entered that city. There were
no casualties.
To Continue Chase.
-San Antonio, April 13.Prepared
for any eventuality, the American
troops will continue the chase until
Villa is killed or captured, or the
war department issues orders to
stop. General Funston stated today
that the advancing American troops
are not endangered through the lack
of communication.
Americans Killed.
San Diego, Cal., April 13.Several
Americans were killed or wounded
in a bandit raid in the vicinity of
Guaymas, Senora, according to a
naval radio message received here
today. The message was forwarded
to the navy department at Washing
ton'and resulted in an order to the
cruiser Denver, now at San Bias,
Teitic, to steam for the Senora sea
port and investigate.
Property Destroyed.
El Paso, Tex., April 13.A band
of Villistas numbering several hun
dred and possibly several thousand
have sacked Sierra Mojada, five miles
across the Coahulia line, destroying
many thousands of dollars worth of
American property, looting the town
of everything of value. It is be
lieved that Villa is directing the op
erations of the bandits. Sierra Mo
jada is 140 miles east of the nearest
point at which American troops are
known to be.
RIFLE AND REVOLVER
GLUB TO BE FORMED
Plans are being made to form a
rifle and revolver club in Bemidji.
The organization will be connected
with the National Rifle association
and will be formed under war de
partment rules. The name of the
organization will probably be the
Beltrami Rifle and Revolver club. A
meeting will be held in a few days.
