King's Daughters
At Benton. City
Gathering Sumptuous
) Women Commended
Enjoyable
. Repast The Home For Aged
The King's Daughters Circle of
Benton City entertained informally
April 6 in honor of their State Pres
ident, Mrs. Burris, of Kansas City.
The hospitable home of Mr. and Mrs.
C. C. Thompson was comfortably
filled' with the Daughters and their
friends. Mrs. Burris said that as her
itinerary was intended to show the
methods of work of the different Cir
cles, she would be pleased if they
would proceed as they usually, did at
their regular meetings. The fact is,
they usually spend the day quilting
and rag sewing, but they had no
quilt in the frames, so the carpet rags
were brought forth and a social time
enjoyed S the needles flew and the
balls grew. At the noon hour the la
dies gathered around the table on
which was such a magnificent spread
as the Thompson home has estab
lished as the correct form. Your scribe
is powerless to des&ribe it. No lunch
eon of any variety, but a banquet,
elaborate and varied. When the
members and guests had again as
sembled around that wTde old-fashioned
Virginia grate the local pres
ident, Mrs. Offutt, took charge. Of
ficers present were Mrs. Offutt;Mrs.
Nieman, vice-president; Mrs. Thomp
son secretary and Mrs. Wooldrldge,
treasurer. Mfembers and visitors pres
ent were.Mesdames Hutcherson, Joh-n
son, Barker.Rockwell, t'tratton. Reed,
Sharp, Barnes, Harlow Williams,
Wooldrldge Byers, Cochran; Misses
Williams"1, Dr. Margaret Hoffsess;and
not least, Elizabeth, the 12 year
daughter of Mrs. J. W. Dowell, who
had been given leave from her school
in the country to spend some hours
with her mother's old friend, Mrs.
Burris. The State President gave the
little girl a vefy cordial reception, and
at parting a word of advice, a mother
ly pat and a"God bless you, my dear."
Mrs. Burris is one of the most log
ical speakers now engaged in the pub
lic work of organized Christian ef
fort. She represents the King's Daugh
ters, their main 'vork in this State,
the upholding and providing for the
"Home for Aged Women" in Mexico,
Missouri.- While giving credit for
the many homes for the aged under
'control of different societies, she pro
ceeded to explain the origin and ob
ject of the one she is working for.
She described an incident on an
ocean liner: When the Captain told
Mrs. Bottome,.a wealthy Christian la
dy who made many trips abroad, of a
young man who had died on his ship
and had asked for some one to give
him the consolation of religion, but
no one volunteered", she said, "Why,
Captain, did you not know I was
aboard? When she returned home
she, with about ten friends, organized
a band to lend a hand In all kinds of
affliction. Their motto "In His
Name"; their badge a small silver
cross. That little band grew till, today
they are in every State In the Union.
The reputation for practical service
gives the little cross as a help and
protection. Wherever the strong op
press the weak, wherever the cry of
pain is heard, over the hot pillow of
the fever tossed slifferer, over the
casket of one taken "away, you will
find the true King's Daughter, com
fortinsr as best Bhe can. No church
creed, 'no nationality, no color.
She dwelt lovingly on the particu
lar State enterprise, the Home In
Mexico, describing the gentle feeble
. ladies who have a quiet haven for the
remainder of their lives. She describ
ed their comfortable rooms, and the
dining room and parlor; the piano
and victrola; the steam heat, the
plants in the windows, and those
thingB that go to make a luxurious
rest place for these tired women who
dwell there.
The meeting gave an uplift and in
spiration to all In attendance. We
tho not members are proud of the
Circle here that has scattered flow
ers all about our community, to sick,
and to those who mourn. Favorable
mention should be made of Cora Fo
ley Thompson, the secretary, who has
stood "rirm "thru evil as well as thru
good report" and whose door is ever
ajar to all in trouble of mind, body
or estate.
Mrs. Wm. Cochran.
Mrs. Mattie C. Peltzer of Kansas
City is coming to Mexico for a court
trial. She is suing an accident in
surance company for $39,000, who
gave an accident policy on the life
of her husband. The husband, last
September fell from a high window
and his death resulted. The trial
will come up here at the June, term
of Circuit Court.

WOOD CRAFT STORY
FOR LITTLE CHILDREN.
Second Story.
Thc sun just peeped over the rocky hill where
lL Brother Wolf and his cousin, the Fox, have
their home in the rocks. Brother Terrapin who
was taking an early morning walk saw them as
they entered their home muddy, tired, and with
something on their backs that looked very much
like two fat hens.
When the Mocker in her nest in the bush near by
informed her mate that it was time for breakfast,
without more ado he flew away in search of a big
fat worm for his little mate in the nest. To tell
the truth something important hfid 'happened.
He stopped long enough in his search to whisper
a secret in the ear of Gentle Dove, and, while the
Dove is no tattle-tale like the Jay, she did tell the
Yellow Hammer and the Wren and the Wood
Cock, and I don't know how the secret got out.
All the birds in the forest must have suspicioned
from his song, for before Mrs. Mocker had finished
eating her woolly worm breakfast the trees were
filled with happy friends, all anxious to see the
babies.
"They look just like their father,'' remarked the
Yellow Hammer.
"Don't you think they will catch cold?" asked
the thoughtful Wren.
"I would like to take them out for a walk," re
marked the Crow. At which the Wren whispered
something to the Mocker, for she had seen some
of Brother Crow's supposed kindness on other
occasions.
A fire had been started at the camp by this time,
and the odor of delicious bacon broiling over the
fire reached the nose of Brother Black Snake,
who was a little late in getting up, and was en
joying the early morning's sun-
"Good morning", said the Coon as she carefully
washed her food at the spring. (We may all take
a lesson from the Coon.)
"Good morning,- Brother Blacksnake, what is
your hurry this morning?"
But the Snake with head high in the air traveled
as though he was in a dream and made no reply.
For did he not smell the delicious bacon, and is
there anything in the world a blacksnake would
rather eat than bacon?.
"Oh, look, Dad," exclaims the boy at the camp.
"Look at the large snake, let's kill it." The father
quickly stooped and caught the wiggling snake
and stroking its cold back said, "You know, son,
the only thing this fellow is guilty of is stealing
an egg now and then from some bird's nest.
The Crow will take ten to his one think of the
good the fellow does. Eve ry time he and a Rattler
meet there is one less Rattler in the world to bite
people, " the snake had slipped through his
fingers and was safely home with his family near
by, and was telling them of his narrow escape
from a fierce giant.
"Bow-wow," barks the dog, "somebody stole my
master's chicks," and about that time there ap
peared a very angry man on horseback, following
a large fierce dog who had his nose to the ground
and who continued to growl and complain at
such an outrage.
Straight in the direction of the rocky hill went
the dog, and spying Mother Wolf as she returned
from the spring he gave chase, Brother Coon,
Opossum and Red Squirrel in their tall trees near
by peeped out ever so little and watched the chase.
Sister Wolf with true mother's love did not go
near her home but, thinking of the two young
whelps at home, led the dog in a large circle.
"My, can't that dog run fast?" shivered the
squirrel, "I'm mighty glad he can't climb a tree.''
The race ltd out of hearing of our friends in
the trees, as Sister Wolf, who was somewhat .. in
the lead, returned and dashed into her home.
Brother Wolf did not hesitate, but taking the lead
in front of the dog, with many a linip,coaxed the
tired dog to continue the chase. Slowly at first
and then faster went the wolf. He soon had the
satisfaction of looking back upon the dog as
he lapped the water in the brook and lay down
to rest in its cooling waters, having given up
the chase.
"I wouldn't have believed the Wolf would have
been so thoughtful and brave," remarked the Coon.
"That shows there is some good in everybody,"
said the Red Squirrel. At which Brother Terra
pin, who was at the foot of the tree, replied, "That's
so, but I didn't notice Brother Fox take any part
in the race."
Sister Opossum, who always grins, remarked,
"Brother Fox is great on planning a thing but
he is not there when the trouble begins."
The happy Red Squirrel exclaimed, "Now,
there you go, Sister Opossum.''
