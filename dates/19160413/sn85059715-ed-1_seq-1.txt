? (BY ASSOCIATED PRESS)
i WASHINGTON. April 13.?General
^Carranza In a note which arrived at
this embassy here early today for presentation
to Secretary Lansing asked
for the withdrawal of American troops
, from Mexico.
, It raises a new Issue In a situation
already much complcxed, the outcome
nf which officials are reticent to predict
until they have gone over the cornIlmunicatlon
carefully and considered
what reply the United States will
imake.
In official quarters It was stated that
me ituu uuupa wiii uui iiu wuii drawn
at this time at ieast and that
l' "whjle the question is being discussed
"with General Carranza the pursuit of
the Villa bandits would be rushed
"with renewed vigor.
EXPEDITION IS UNDERTAKEN
UNDER MISUNDERSTANDING
. ?
(BY ASSOCIATED FSBBS)
I MEXICO CITY. April 13.?The note
which the Mexican government has
sent to Washington for delivery to
Secretary Lansing asks for "disoccupation
of the territory occupied by American
troops in view of Villa's party
J having been destroyed."
Throughout the note emphasis is
laid on the fact that, the American expedition
was undertaken under a misunderstanding.
Although acting in
good faith, the declaration is made
that the United States had interpreted
the first note of the de facto government
as effecting a definite agreement
between the two nations; but the in|
tention of the defacto government was
that no expedition should be sent into
Mexico until terms and conditions relative
to an agreement were defined.
; The note declares therefore that in
consequence of no final agreement
, having been reached as to the terms
of the treaty to regulate the reciprocal
passage of troops over the dividing
line "the Mexican government judges
it. convenient to suspend for the present
all discussion or negotiations in
this particular, or founded on the circumstances
that tho expedition sent by
the United States government to pursue
Villa is without foundation in virtue
of the non-existence of a previous
agreement, formal and definite."
* What was intended by the note of
I (March 10, It is pointed out, was to subi
mlt a proposal "by means of which
the forces of one and the other country
j could reciprocally cross the dividing
i line in pursuit of bandits if unfortunately
there should be repeated along
the border acts like those committed
) in Columbus."
The fact that the United States has
incorrectly interpreted the note of
IMarch 10 was called to the attention
of the Washington government, the
statement points out, in a note dated
March 17. This note likewise emphasized
that the passaie of troops
would be permitted "only, if unfortunately,
from this time forward there
should be repeated irruptions like the
orte registered at Columbus or any
other kind whatever at any point ol
the frontier line."
On iMarch 18, the statement continues,
Frank Polk, acting secretary oi
state, in an interview with the Carranea
confidential agent, deplored not having
received the observations of the
Mexican government, before American
troops crossed the border declaring
t that the passage of troops took place
' in the best of faith and in the bellel
that it would not be necessary to enter
I into more details of an agreement
which was considered definite and
ended.
These declarations made by Mr
Polk were later confirmed on March

At One of the Most Interesting

In some respects the most later

for his subject "The Earnest' Touch,'

He said la part as follows: "Whei

;
22 to the Mexican representative L>y|
: Secretary Lansing "who slated also,
| that he was sorry at having Inter-,
I preted wrongly the contonts of the
, said note In respect to the passage of
troops and that they would not advance
more to the south of tho placo
I where they thon were."
Reference Is aUo made In the note
to the declaration made by President
I Wilson on March 26. saying "the expedition
was orderod under an agrec1
ment with the defacto government of
Mexico for the purpose only of capturing
the bandit Villa, whose forces havo
Invaded territory of the United States,
and on no pretext whatever would we
order an Invasion of that rcpubllo or a
violation of Its sovereignty."
"That Idea," continued the note,
"published by his excellency, Presl.
dent Wilson, was rectified on March 31 I
by a montage sent to our confidential
i agent In Wasrlngton In which he was
i Instructed to call your attention to the
Idea Indicated since the note of March
10 referred to tho reciprocal passage
of troops only In case that Incidents
like those which occurred at Columbus
1 should be repeated."
In concluding the note, which is
signed by Candido Aguilar, secretary
: for foreign affairs, points out that as
! the American expedition has fulfilled
its object insofar as It will be able to
do so as the party headed by Villa has
already been dispersed, and finally because
there are Mexican troops In
sufficient numbers pursuing them and
more forces are being sent to exterminate
the rest of the beaten party,
the first chief of the Constitutionalist
army, charged with tho executive power
of the nation, considers "that it Is
already time to treat with the United
States for tho withdrawal of tholr
j forces from our territory."

Since, under present conditions,
the men at the camps are obliged to
pay their own way, no express obligation
or enlistment under the Government
is involved. Thoso who have
followed the trend of the training,
however, are impressed with tho possibility
of tho Plsttsburg idea becoming

the spirit of efficiency, discipline,
