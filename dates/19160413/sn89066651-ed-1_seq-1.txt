About m() chicks from 92 eggs
is the record the agriculture
class made with their first hatch
this season. Considering the
fact that the incubator now from
i o'clock in the afternoon until
9 o'clock the next day is without
any attention the hatch was ex
ceptionally good.

began the study of Stevenson's
"Treasure Island" this week.

members of the basket ball
teams at the home of Rev. and
