IN NOTE TO THE MEXICAN EMBASSY AT WASHINGTON
TODAY, PROVISIONAL PRESIDENT REQUESTS THE
WITHDRAWAL OF AMERICANS.
This Request Raises New Issue to the Already Complex Situa

Crossed the Line Without Permission and Should be With

that the American Troops Will Not be Withdrawn for the
Present at Least and that While the Question is Being Dis

The border awaited expectant
ly today the United States' an
wer to Carranza's note, know
ing that the situation is fraught
with possibilities. With the
population in the majority of
the towns alone the border
largely Mexican and with the
Mexican towns well garrisoned
by Carranza soldiers across the
river, everything possible is be
ing done to safeguard the
American side.
The nineteen thousand
troops from San Diego, Califor
nia to Brownsville, Texas, are
on edge and are prepared for
all eventualities.
Carranza has preceded his
note, officers declared, with
military preparations and re
ports that the defactoists have
been in positions to cut the
American communications are
received as truth.
Washington, April 13. Carranza in
a note arriving at the Mexican em
bassy today asks the withdrawal of
the American troops from Mexico.
The note is understood to raise a
new issue in the already complicated
situation, the outcome of which of
ficial Washington is reticent to pre
dict, until the communication has
been considered carefully, and the
probable reply of the United States
given out.
It is understood that the Mexican
government contends that the Ameri
cans crossed the line without per
mission and should be withdrawn un
til a formal compact has been enter
ed into between the two govern
ments. In official quarters it was stated
that the American troops would not
be withdrawn at present, and while
the question is being discussed, the
pursuit of Villa will be continued
with renewed vigor.
Although Carranza has raised side
issues, the main question was that the
punitive expedition's object has been
accomplished, as far as it could be,
and the Villistas dispersed.
War department officials say they
have no evidence that the bandit
bands have been exterminated.
State department officials took the
view that the note was not a demand
for withdrawal, but an invitation for
negotiations to limit the stay of the
Americans.
It was announced that the negotia
tions will be conducted exclusively
by Secretary Lansing.
Expected Along Border.
El Paso, Tex., April 13. Mexican
officials were not surprised at Car
ranza's note today, and army officers
would not discuss the question.
Should the troops be recalled, it
would require three or four weeks
until the last man crossed the bor

AN ELABORATE
SUCCESS
WITH CLOSING CONCERT OF THE
ARTILLERY BAND AT THE HIGH
SCHOOL LAST NIGHT, FESTIVI
TIES COME TO CLOSE.
The first annual Style Show of the
Ardmore Business Men's association
is now history, and if there is a mem
ber of the association who regrets
tho effort it cost to produce such a
fete, bis identity has not been made
known. The Business Men's asso
ciation ha3 every reason to be proud
of their first effort and are enthusias
tically proclaiming that the second
annual show next year will surpass
their initial attempt,
have the Style Show, the officers
have the Style Show, the officres
realized that one of the prime requi
sites was fine music. With this ob
ject in view, they got Into communi
cation with the director of the Fifth
Field Artillery Band, United States
army, stationed at Fort Sill, and suc
ceeded in securing their services for
the. week. The band was a great hit
at every appearance, and left the city
with a reputation that will not soon
be forgotten.
From the opening day until the
close there was something of interest
being shown the thousands of visit
ors who thronged the city, and the
merchants constantly had on dis
play their finest wares. It was a
profitable week for the business men,
although they took more time in en
tertaining tho visitors than they did
in selling goods.
The automobile exhibit at the cor
ner of Main and C street was a dis
tinctive feature that attracted many
visitors. Many makes of cars were
displayed and the demonstrators have
reported several sales during the
week. The out-of-town demonstrators
expressed complete satisfaction to the
management of the show, and de
parted well satisfied with their week's
efforts.
The crowning event of the week
was the floral parade Monday after
noon, when some of the most elabo
rately decorated cars imaginable were
in line. Visitors from other cities
who have viewed parades of this
character in larger cities stated that
it surpassed in many particulars the
.shows they had witnessed, and were
surprised that a city the size of Ard
more should attempt such an elabo
rate affair.
From everv standpoint, the show
was an elaborate success, and the
officers and members of the associa
tion can congratulate themselves
upon the efforts they made to show
the outside world that the terrible
calamity which visited the city the
past year has not dampened the Ard
more spirit, and has advertised to
the state that whatever happens Ard
more business men can forget their
troubles and royally entertain vis
itors. Villa has some of the qualities of
the gi'.a monster, but not the staying
qualities. : -1 'S 5;Jl

With no cause that his family Or

OH & Milling company, shortly after
he returned to his home at 113 Third

the ball passing entirely through his

LASTCONCERT
BY IMITARY
BAND SUCCESS
FINEST PROGRAM EVER HEARD
IN THIS CITY WAS GIVEN BY
DIRECTOR MONTIN AND HIS
MEN LAST NIGHT.
The last concei t given by the Fifth
Field Artillery l)..nd, under the direc
tion of Prof. Montin at the High
school auditorium last night was an
artistic success, and those who re
mained away on account of other
attractions missed the best musical
treat ever given by a military band in
this city. The band gave the concert
more as a compliment to (lie Busi
ness Men's association than from
iny other desire, and the audience
greeted every number with salvos of
applause which demonstrated their
appreciajion of the work of Director
Montin and his men.
No set program was prepared be
forehand, but the selections rendered
were of the very heaviest character,
which brought into effect the perfect
training of this splendid. organization.
Director Montin favored the audi
ence with a euphonium solo, taking
the Toreador song from Carmen, and
the manner in which he rendered
this classic demonstrated tho fact
that lie is a perfect master of the
instrument. He responded with a se
lect ion from the works of Verdi,
which was equally as good as his
initial number.
Corporal Bird san

accompanied by the band, and capti
vated tho audience with his splendid
voice. As an encore, a trio, con
sisting of Corporal Bird and two
other members of the band, responded
with a couple of choruses from pop
ular songs.
Bandsman Jagendorf, piccolo and
flute soloist, with the band, delight
ed the audience with a rippling polka
on the piccolo, especially adapted to
that instrument, which made a de
cided hit, and he was compelled to
respond to several encores, and his
work was but another demonstration
of the individual ability of each mem-

Bulletin. i
1:00 p. m.
Washington The first loss
of American lives in the Mexi
can punitive expedition occur
red in the fighting at Parral,
when Mexican civilians fired oil
American Soldiers, killing one
and wounding another. The
American troops replied, kill
ing many, acording to official
advices received late today.
The Carranza troops did not
fire on Americans, but assist
ed in restoring order.
Torreon, Mexico, April 13.
Villa is believed to be near or
at Urbinas Ranch at Las Nievas
south of Rosario, Durango. He
is reported to be heading to
ward the Nazes river in the di
rection of the Contreras and
Ceniceros bandits.
I
San Antonio, Tex.. April 13.
General Funston received ad
vices today of an encounter be
tween American soldiers and
either Mexican military forces
or the civilian population of
Parral. The details are una
vailable.
Consul Letcher at Chihuahua
sent a report quoting the com
mander of the Parral garrison,
who said that the Americans
appeared unheralded in the
town causing alarm among the
Mexicans who fired upon the
Americans, the latter returnincr
the shots. The Parral com
mander belittles the event.
Carranza's note asking the
withdrawal of the Americans
caused no surprise here. In the
light or developments, military
men regard the activity of the
Carranza soldiers on the border,
and in Chihuahua as explained.
They assume that the Carran
cistas are quietly being placed
in a position to be most effect
ive in case of a break with the
Americans.
Until Funston receives orders
from Washington, no change
will be made in the conduct of
the Villa campaign.
f
Militia to Guard Border.
Washington, April 13. Unless tho
work of the punitive expedition in
Mexico Is accomplished within a very
few days, means will be sought to
strengthen General Pershing's forces
at the front, it was authoritatively
announced last night. Jt Is explained
that General Funston will ask tho
war department to move into tha
southern department t he 4,0n) troops
that are stationed at other points In
the United States. If this Is done
they will be placed on duty along
the border, relieving for service in
Mexico 20,00)) soldiers now doing gar
rison and patrol work on the frontier.
If the department regards the trans
fer of troops not now in the depart
ment Inexpedient, it is believed that
Funston will recommend the use of
state militia to relieve the troop3 on
the border. ,
