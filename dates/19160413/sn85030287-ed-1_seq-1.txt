Clean Up Week
The City Council has designat
ed the week of April 17 to 22 as
' f clean up week and urge that ev
ery citizen tnake a special effort
to see that trash of all kinds is
removed from the streets and al
leys and vacant property.- Have
your rubbish piled .in somecon
. venient place and the city will
haul it away free of charge.
: S. D. ADAMS, Mayor.
The attention of the public in
- general and the mayors and fire
chiefs of towns in particular is
called to the fact that the week
of April 17 to 22 has been set
apart by proclamation of Gov
ernor Capper as
CLEAN-UP WEEK
in all the cities and towns and on
the farms of Kansas.
Iu view of the fact that an av
erage of over three million dol
lars worth of property is con
sumed by fire in Kansas each
year and the further fact that
nearly all fires are absolutely
preventable, I wish to urge upon
both private citizens and public
officials the importance of this
Clean-up Week. ..V: ,;-
Many fires may be traced, di
ll rectly to accumulations of trash
in fence corners, yards, alleys,
cellars and attics.x These ac
cumulations are especially com
mon in the . winter season.
Spring, when nature puts on its
clean, fresh garments, is a very
appropriate time for cleaning up
in and around the habitations of
man. Carelessness has wreck
ed more homes than siege guns.
The success of Clean-up Week
depends on the efforts of all the
people.
Will you do your part to save
yourself and your neighbor from
what might be a serious fire?
, L. T. Hussey,
State Fire Marshal.
Sweet Talks
"- Dodge City, April 8. In a let
ter published in the Daily Globe
yesterday Archie Sweet, held in
the Ford county jail here in con
nection with the murder of Nel
lie Byejrs, denies the statement
contained in an alleged interview
with the prisoner some days ago.
The statement in question quot
. ed Sweet as saying that "he saw
the teacher a few minutes before
she was killed." In his reply
Sweet says: -
'J brand this as an untruth.
I have never made such a state
ment. It is used only to make it
hard for me to get a square deal
. and to embitter the minds of the
men who will be on the jury.
This is not fair and any one who
says I have made such a state
ment has told a lie, an unjust lie.
I have not made any such a state
ment to Attorney General Brew.
)( ster, County Attorney H. W.
Stubbs or anyone else and if they
say that I did tbey have lied."

Prepare Ground Well
Manhattan Kansas, April, 12
"Kill two crops of weeks before
planting corn, is a good rule, or
in the language of the practical
farmer, do half your season's
cultivating before you plant,"
said G. E. Thompson, specialist
in crops in the division of exten
sion of the Kansas State Agri
cultural college,
"Don't be in a hurry to plant
your corn," continued Mr.
Thompson. "A good start is an
important factor in the final yield
of any crop. Corn planted early
on poorly prepared ground often
makes an irregular stand, grows
slowly, is injured by weeds, and
at the close of the season makes
a light yield, while seed from the
same lot planted after the ground
is well warmed grows more rap
idly, is not so easily choked back
by weeks, and makes a larger
yield.
The sunflower, Russian thistle
smartweed and many other
weeds are particularly liberal in
using the water supply intended
for the growing crop. It is not
only because of the water used
thai weeds injure crops, but also
because they use plant food
which has been dissolved in the
soil and which should be used by
the useful plants. The shading
effect of rapidly growing seeds
likewise injures the young corn,"
Well selected seed of home
grown corn nearly always out
yields the best of imported seed
by from two to six bushels to
the acre. Kansas farmers are
consequently advised to plant
this type of corn,
An increased yield from a field
without increased labor means
a greater profit, and this increas
ed yield can be secured better
and more surely by planting well
selected seed of good home grown
corn than by planting imported
seed of unadapted and untried
varieties.

Autos In Kansas
Topeka, April 11 It is prob
able that Kansas will have more
than 90,000 motor cars licensed
before July 1. An average of
157 licenses a day will bring the
total up to this figure and for six
weeks this has been the. average
There hasn't been any real good
motor car weather in the past
month or so either.
The growth in the number of
cars has been greater this year
than in any year, and there are
a larger number of higher pric
ed cars being purchased this
spring than a year ago or two
years ago. This is in proportion
to the number purchased, of
course. The Ford makes up
about one third of the cars in
Kansas, but more cars of one
thousand dollars or above are be
ing purchased this spring.
There were 83,487 cars licens'
ed when the motor car license
department closed last night.
This included all those applied
for yesterday. The total is ex
pected to reach the 84,000 mark
by Saturday, especially if the fine
weather that started in yester
day continues.
The new tags for use after
July l will tre; shipped this week
from the factory in St. Louis.
Ninety thousand tags were or
dered and the first shipment
will be made during the present
week.
May Stewart
Among the best attractions
appearing at Phtlps theatre this
season was Miss May Stewart
and her celebrated company of
real actors presenting "Mac
beth'' by Wm. Sbakespear and
a rollicking five act comedy,
The Honeymoon" or "Taming
a Wife." Those who appreciate
good actiDg are loud in their
praises of the company's presen
tation of the four scenes from
Macbeth, while it would indeed
be a dull person who would fail
to note the real merit in the
second part of the bill.
Jeff Harmon, who lives sixteen
miles south of Meade, had a
costly experience with mice, a
short time ago. Mr. Harmon
had been away from his claim
house for several weeks and up
on bis return found that a num
ber of mice had taken up their
abode tbire during his absence,
and worst of all tbey had a mania
for matches. Feeling sure that
tbey would not molest them if
under bis pillow, he put them
there and retired. The mice
evidently found them, for about
two a. m. Mr. Harmon awoke to
find bis bed in flames. He man
aged to escape without injury,
but bis bouse was in ashes be
fore help arrived.
Another good rain visited this
section Wednesday night
Crops of all kinds are in fine
condition since the recent rain,
and the wheat, especially, gives
promise of making an excellent
crop.
