The Gift
of God
By REV. W. W. KETCHUM
Director of Practical Course Moody
Bible Institute of Chicago
TEXT—The gift of Qod Is eternal life
through Jeeua Christ our Lord,—Roman*
*;2S.
A gift is something for which we
do not work. It is something that is
not naturally our
fr 1 Just due. It is
something that
someone gracious
ly gives us be
cause be or she
is interested In
us. This text in
the revision
speaks of this
gift as the free
gift of God. Now
there are many
people who ex
pect to pay their
way Into heaven
—many who ex
pect to compen-
sate God for
eternal life, when the text says that
(he free gift of God Is eternal life.
Eternal life —what Is it? It Is the
opposite of eternal death. Not eternal
death does not mean nonexistence any
more than eternal life means con
tinued existence. God’s word teaches
that the soul never dies, In the sense
of going out of existence. It does say
that “The soul that slnneth, It shall
die," but we must Interpret the words
of the Bible by the Bible. The Bible,
you know. Is not only a book that
gives us the truth, but It defines the
truth that it gives, and when It talks
about eternal death It does not mean
the annihilation of the soul It Is a
truth that whatever exists always ex
ists, so the scientists tell us, and the
Bible says that the human soul lives
forever. Well, what Is eternal life
then, and what Is eternal death? Per
haps we might say that eternal life
means being born of God, having the
life of Qod. It Is not our natural life
prolonged Into endless duration. It
is the divine life Imparted to us, the
very life of God himself communi
cated to a human soul. To put It In
another way, we might say that etern
al life Is right existence, while eternal
death Is wrong existence, or, to put
It In still another way, eternal life Is
living In the presence of God, while
eternal death Is having the wrath
of God abiding on one.
Now, God’s gift Is eternal life. Our
text says that he offers us this life
through Jesus Christ our Lord, that
Is, Christ Is the medium through
whom eternal life comes. What a
wonderful thing It Is to know that God
has planned to give the human race,
dead in trespasses and In sins, eternal
life through his son. What Is Involved
In that truth? A great deal, my
friends.
First of all. that on the cross Christ
died for our sins.
Secondly, that there upon the cross
God laid upon Christ all our sins.
Thirdly, that all our sins will be
forgiven us on condition of our simple
acceptance by faith of his Son, and the
one who thus receives his Son. we are
told, Is born, “not of blood, nor of the
will of the flesh, nor of the will of
man, but of God.” I have met many
people who were striving to get etern
al life. 1 have even met Christians
who have had the Idea that eternal life
becomes theirs, not through faith, but
by works of righteousness which they
dp.
I shall never forget preaching In a
little church In the Catskills, and talk
ing about the way of salvation, when a
brother arose and controverted what
I said about the simple way of having
eternal life through the acceptance by
faith of Jesus Christ as one’s Savior.
Another brother, thinking he would
pour oil on the water, which was very
troublous Just then, told about two
theologians who were crossing a
stream. One of the theologians was
arguing that salvation was by works,
and the other that salvation was by
faith, when the oarsman, listening to
the argument, began to row with one
oar, and the boat went round and
round, when they said, ‘‘What are you
doing?” and he replied, “Don’t you see,
that oar with which I km rowing Is
works, and I don’t get anywhere,” and
then he took the other oar and rowed
with that, and went round and round
In the other direction, and he said,
"That oar, you see, Is faith, and when
I row alone with that we do not get
across the stream. To reach the oth
er shore we must row with both oars.”.
Thai was a good story, but a poor Il
lustration, for, while It sounds very
plausible, the trouble Is R Is not
epriptural. The Bible tells us that It
j Is “not by works of righteousness that
| fve have done, but according to his
I mercy he saved us.” Change the Illus
tration and have It, true to the Scrip
tures. Jesus Christ Is the oarsman,
and Is rowing the boat of salvation
from earth to heaven, and If we would
reach the other shore what we must
do Is by simple faith to get on board.
I go down to the ferry slip In New
York. Now, If I wish to go across to
the other side, what 1 must do Is to
step upon the ferry boat. The mo
ment I do that I have trusted myself
to the ferry, and It Is for the ferry
now. by Its own power, to take me
over. This crudely Illustrates Christ’s
work of salvation for us. We commit
ourselves to him, and be, by his own
power and work saves us.

Girl i

(Copyright, Wlti. by W. U. Chapman.,)
"What does it mean?”
Mabel Stone was a picture of dis
tress and dread as she stood before
the closed and locked door of Mason
& Co., where she had worked as
stenographer for over two years, and
she gazed appealingly into the trou
bled face of John Davis, chi of clerk of
the establishment.
“It means Just what it says.’’ John
soberly replied, aii i i..s in e twitched
and he was white to the lips--"gone
Into the hands of a receiver. That
means that the house has gone under,
I understand," and there was an un
steady catch in h l ' "e'cc—“l under
stand that they will not pay ten cents
on the dollar.”
“Oh. dear!” fa’te-'-d Miss Stone.
“Then we will—there will be no
work?"
“None, I fear, for most of ns.” Then
he brightened up momentarily. ”As
to you, though.” he addi d. "a friend
in another office was asking me only
yesterday to find him an expert
stenographer, and I am sure you can
start in your new place at once.”
“But you?" asked Mabel solicitous
ly. "Always thinking of others! It
Is to you that I owe my training, ray
first encouragement when I had no po
sition. Oh, Mr. Davis! 1 have felt so
grateful to you that there is scarcely
a letter passes between myself and my
mother that we do not mention you.
And you have worked so steadily, 1
can see that you are worn all out. 1
have saved some money, and mother
needs me at home, and 1 would have
left long since if it had not been —If it
“It Means Just What It Says.”
had not been," and she blushed con
sclously, "that 1 felt 1 nulst be loyal,
and might be helpful to you.”
"Thank you, Miss Stone,” said John
graciously. “Such words cheer me
and make mo feel not utterly friend
less. 1 have received quite a shock In
this failure’’—and he looked it and
Mabe| noticed it. "In fact, 1 have lost
every dollar 1 have In the world.”
"Oh, dear!" cried Mabel In dismay
and sympathy, and she was nearly
crying,
“You see, I had two thousand dollars
saved up,” explained John. "I loaned
a poor Inventor one thousand dollars
to develop a patent and nothing has
come of It. The house here heard of
It and ridiculed my ’wildcat’ invest
ment. as they called It. They, how
ever, got me to invest my other one
thousand dollars with them, promising
eight per cent returns. Now —”
John made a feeble movement with
his hand. His eyes closed as though
he were about to faint and Mabel In
voluntarily clasped his arm to steady
him.
"Why! You are 111,” she said solicit
ously. “Mr. Davis,” and she was the
directing power now, "this will not do
at all. Come with me. I want tf
talk over something with you.”
John was nothing loath, for he was
•wearied, disheartened, in fact, quite
prostrated with the shock of his sud
den loss. There was a neat little candy
shop where they served soda water.
The workers In the various offices
were wont at times to eat their lunches
there. Mabel led her companion to a
table, ordered two cups of steaming
coffee and was quite the sisterly com
forter.
“I want to ask you to allow me to
try and show how I appreciate all you
have done for me,” she said. "Every
body has seen how you have been
working yourself to death at the office.
This new trouble has crushed you.
Please let me plan a little way into
the future, will you not?’
The invigorating beverage, the wist
ful, pleading eyes, the friend in need
brought a rare sense of comfort to
tired, tempest-tossed John Davis.
“You see, down home I‘have a mar
ried sister who lives near us and keeps
boarders. Her husband has deserted
her. She, too, has heard of you, and
you would be a welcome guest until
you get rested up. Then there Is a
place fur such a good business mana
ger as -you are In some of the plants
In our home town. lam sure you can
do well there. If It is only to gel your
mind off from your troubles and make
a - iew start in life, follow my advice,
won’t you, Mr. Davis?"
What balm for his wounded spirit in
the gentle earnest interest of this kind,
grateful girl! He allowed her to in
fluence his mind and will for the time
being. With the first scent of country
flowers coming through the open car
window as the train sped on its way,
It seemed to John as though all the
servitude and complications of his city
career had drifted away into a lost
memory.
The reception which Mrs. Stone
gave him, the homelike, heartfelt wel
come of all those close to Mabel,
opened a new chapter in the lonely
life of John Davis. Within a month
he was a fixture at the home of Kuth,
the married sister of Mabel. He. too,
had secured a pleasant, reasonably
profitable position.
John saw a great deal of Mabel. She
came to her sister's daily and he would
call at her home several times a week.
They attended choir practice together,
for both were good singers. Compan
ionship and time were making an ideal
life for those two congenial spirits.
”1 love her. Oh! Can it he possible
that the great happiness of her love in
return is to be mine?” he began to tell
himself ardently.
Then came a rude shock. Coming
from work at dusk one evening, he
saw Mabel meet and talk hurriedly,
Just as though they were close friends,
to a tall handsome man, who hurried
away as John approached. This was
near the Stone home.
The incident worried John, for Ma
bel made no explanation, and, he
fancied, acted troubled, a* though con
cealing something from him. A week
later, one night, crossing the space
between the two homos he almost ran
upon Mabel and the stranger. She
was holding his hands and looking
earnestly into his face, John heard
her speak the words: "Roland, dear!”
After that John evaded Mabel. She
loved another, that was evident. John
decided what he would do. He went
to her sister one evening as she sat
alone in the little parlor of the board
ing house.
John could not refrain from pour
ing out his soul to her. He bound her
to secrecy. Then he told of his grow
ing love for Mabel, of his discov ry
that she loved another, lie was going
away, he said, and he pledged Ruth
never to tell Mabel of this soul to soul
confidence.
"On account of Mabel and because
she prefers someone else —nonsense!”
cried Ruth.
“But 1 have seen Mabel with this
stranger more than onee," explained
John. "And once—oh, there can bo no
doubt of it —1 heard her call him 'Ro
land, dear'.”
Wherewith, to tho astonishment of
John, Ruth sank white and faint to a
chair, gasping out:
"My husband!"
Then it all came out. Mabel had
secretly and diligently labored to re
unite husband and wife.
And John did not leave tho pretty
little town in a week, nor In a month
or ever, for all tho clouds of suspicion
and despair were cleared away and tin
sunshine of love made all their life
radiant.
GIANT POWER OF THE HEART
Marvelous Work Performed by That
Organ Described by Doctor
Goodall.
Dr. J. Strickland Goodall Illustrates
the enormous power of tho human
heart in a striking way, remarks an
exchange.
Take a two-pownd weight in the
palm of tho hand, resting the elbow
upon n table, and raise and lower it
from the level of the elbow to the
shoulder. This is exactly the work
done by tho heart at each beat. Do
this about seventy or eighty times a
minute and see how long you can keep
it up.
At each contraction the heart does
enough work to lift a two-pound
weight one foot. The heart of a
young and healthy person is almost
Immune to weariness or strain. But
If its muscles ho weakened by the ac
cumulation of body poisons, or by ane
mia, it is very easily strained. The
heart has been known to break from
the strain of sudden emotion. Anger
will increase the work of the heart
from 152 to 224 foot pounds a minute.
Therefore keep your temper, Is a
good psychological advice.
Running to catch a train, running
upstairs or any sudden and unusual
exertion puts a great extra strain
upon the heart. The healthy heart of
youth is equal to such strains; not so
the heart that has been weakened by
disease, dissipation or old age. Doc
tor Goodall tested the heart of a
healthy man before he ran to catch a
train; It was beating 76 to the min
ute and doing 152 foot pounds of work
a minute. He tested it immediately
after the run; it was beating 180 to
the minute and doing 260 foot pounds
ot work a minute.
Middle Age.
There comes a clear day when one
realizes that clothes are to keep the
weather off you, that food is to give
you health, that home is shelter and
inspiration; that, aside from being
clean and inoffensive, one’s personal
appearance does not signify very
much; that tho main thing In life is to
be going along toward the goal of
your Ideals. That Isn't getting old, it’s
getting sense. From then on time ts
not master, but friend.—Collide

HOSPITAL IN HISTORY
INSTITUTIONS HAVE BEEN
KNOWN FROM EARLY TIMES.
Before the Christian Era the Care of
the Afflicted Was Considered a
Public Duty Philadelphia
Had First in America.
The first hospital established in
America was opened in Philadelphia
on February 7, 1750. For nearly two
years Benjamin Franklin and other
Influential men were, working for the
establishment of such an institution.
A charter was granted in May, 1751,
and the first board of trustees was
elected the July following.
The day of the opening a number of
patients were admitted who were reg
ularly attended and given their medi
cine free. Joshua Crosby was the hi st
president and Benjamin Franklin the
first clerk.
The second hospltsJ established was
in New York In 1771. From these ear
ly beginnings there has now grown up
In the United Stales a veritable forest
of hospitals. Every city, town and
village lias its duly appointed institu
tions of this character, and the hos
pitals of the United States are now
acknowledged the most handsomely
and thoroughly equipped in the world,
and serve as models for European ar
chitects.
Hospitals were founded In very ear
ly times, India, Persia and Arabia
had hospitals supported by their kings
and rulers before the Christian
era. As far back as the earliest pe
riod In Greek history the sick are
said to have been treated in the Tem
ple of Aesculapius al Epidaurus,
In the early Jewish period a house
for the reception of the sick was
called Beth Holem. Such an institu
tion was Beth Saida, mentioned in
the New Testament.
Military hospitals are of compara
tively recent origin, born of the needs
of warfare and the advance of medi
cal science and hygiene. In the Cri
mean war of 1854 the French alone of
the allied powers possessed anything
approaching the equipment now com
mon to all armies.
The English wounded were carried
off the field in rough-and-ready fash
ion, sailors’ hammocks being ultimate
ly utilized as a rude substitute for tho
French stretcher and ambulance.
Surgeons attended tho wounded on
the field, for whom there were little or
no after accommodations, until,
spurred by the publication of Florence
Nightingale’s description of condi
tions, the English government appoint
ed Lord Merbert’s commission, which
resulted In more effective hospital
service.
The hospital ship was established la
the early sixties, and shortly after
ward the United States hospital corps
was organized. The army nurse corps
which ts an auxiliary branch of the
medical department, was established
In accordance with an army bill passed
as recently as February 2, 1901.
Hospital Sunday is observed In the
United Slates on the last Sunday in
December, and In England the Sunday
nearest June 15, on which days the
collections in churches are devoted
to the support of hospitals. The cus
tom has been generally adopted since
1873.
Old English Street Names.
Old street names In London often
assumed strange (arms through pop
ular corruptions. Gutter lane, for in
stance, was named after Its owner,
who happened to be one Guthurun. A
flagrant example was Hangman’s
Gains, by the Tower, “a strange cor
ruption.” as Strype tells us, “for
Haramea and Guynes, where the poor
tradespeople of Hammes and Guynes
were allotted to dwell after Calais and
those places were taken from the Eng
lish.” Many years ago, In Pentonvillo,
there was a Dobbin’s place, and that
homely Dobbin’s was but D’Aublgny
upon English tongues.
In some cases it is possible to trans
form an ugly road name into aoma
thing quite pleasant, and even roman
tic, without much difficulty. There is
the steep road which runs up from
Parliament Hill Fields to Highgate. It
used to bo known as Swine's lane, ac
cording to local antiquarians. Now
adays the Cockney may pronounce it
much as before when he takes his
ticket on the tram from Holborn. But
the spelling Is different—Swain's Lane,
■ —London Chronicle.
Feed 3,000 Starving Elk.
Driven from the mountainous por
tions of the Yellowstone National park
by the heavy snowfall, which pre
vented their grazing, great numbers
of wild animals, wards of the United
States, are being fed by the govern
ment park officials hero until such
lime as the weather moderates suffi
ciently to allow them to return to
thefr native haunts.
Three thousand elk, 2,000 deer and
several hundred mountain sheep are
drawing a dally “ration” of hay at the
feeding grounds a few miles from the
park.
Government officials believe no
great loss of life among the animals
has occurred.
More Profitable,
'lf an invading army landed In
New York 1 suppose the first thing
they’d do would be to take possession
of all the banks.”
"Being poor, ignorant foreigners,
they probably would, but if they knew
anything they’d go after the hat

restaurants.**

rans who are under the misapprehen
sion that the Mexican Is some kind
of negro—or, at least, that there Is a
strong infusion of African blood, as in
Haiti. Nothing could bo farther from
the truth. Not only is there less Af
rican blood in Mexico than m the
United States, in proportion to popu
lation, but there is less even after you
have eliminated our black belt. Many
better informed persons refer to the
native Mexicans as Indians. But they
are not Indians —as we know Indians.
True, here and there in the mountain
ous regions are found tribes of serai
savages who compare with the native
peoples of what is now the United
States, says llje World Outlook. But
they llgure in national affairs little
more than our own pure-bleed Chore
kees et al. ligure here. When the Span
ish conqueror came the bulk of the
aboriginal Mexicans were not savages,
hut a civilized people, as far removed
from the wild nomads of North Amer
ica us the white races themselves.
This aboriginal Mexican element is va
riously estimated as representing from
one-third to one-half the population, by
some guessers even more. It has fur
nished some of the most learned schol
ars and exulted patriots celebrated in
Mexican history. The greater part of
the remaining population is made up
of mixed Spanish and aboriginal blood,
from which is derived the term,
"Spanish-American.” it is to this mix
ture of European and Aztec that is at
tributed the peculiar traits of the
“Spanish-American character," and the
supposedly woeful inferiority of our
neighbors to the southward.
ST. JOHN'S EVE CUSTOMS
Brittany Village Folk Kindle Great
Bonfires and Maidens Use Charms
To Get Husbands.
Some of the customs of St. John s
eve in Brittany are as quaint as they
are picturesque. In many villages
giant bonfires are built, and round
them, in a circle, seats are placed for
the departed. The cure has charge of
kindling fire, or, where it is possible,
a buy dressed as an angel is let down
the bell tower by means of a pulley,
and lifted up out of sight again after
he has applied a lighted faggot to the
pile.
To insure getting a husband before
the end of the year the village maid
ens dance round nine bonfires, and
return home to dream of the young
man destined for them. At midnight
they rise and lay the table with bread
and cheese and garlic, and throw the
front door wide open. There 1s no ob
ligation f- r them to accept whoever Is
the first to enter, but it often hap
pens that they do, for the right man
is not, likely to miss his chance. If.
indeed, ho appears, the parents are
quickly i ailed in to give their con
sent to a betrothal, which takes place
there and then.

Modern War Conditions.
The swot •! Is the costliest single
article in the equipment a subaltern
officer of the British army must buy,
and since under present conditions
this weapon is worn only when roy
alty reviews tho troop.A that form of
celebration proving none too wel

grandchildren of veterans sixty years
or so hence will weep ever the dear
little rusty tin can in which the old
hero carried his bouillon to the battle
line at Mons.
Gets Soft Wood From America.
