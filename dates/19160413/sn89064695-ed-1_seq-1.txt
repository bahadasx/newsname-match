G. Daniels, Renegade Detective
Harper, and Ex-Supt. John R.
Howard, are the scalps that now
hang from the belt of the goddess
of righteousness.
Senator Clapp, ex-Gov Eber
hart, Frank Kellogg, the so-called
trust buster, are all candidates for
the United States senate from this
state. The Grippewas of Minne
sota should not forget their obli
gations to Senator CUpp and they
should vote for him unanimously,
and take the trouble of turning
out to do so. John T. Van Metre,
the Mahnomen attorney, who was
at Washington curing the past
winter in an effort to try and fix
up the troubles which surround
land titles upon this reservation,
could tell the settler* upon this
reservation who have purchased
lands, that Senator Clapp is their
only dependence in rec-pecfto this
matter in Congress.
Warren K. Moorhead, the man
who almost consented to accept a
fake bribe offer of twenty five
thousand dollars to drop his inves
tigations while he was here in
1909, and who stated in justifica
tion of this that he had tome boj
to educate, wrote numerous letters
to members of Congress seating
that the better element of this res
ervation is opposed to the Chio
pewa General Council. It is such
men as Moorhead who are detri
mental to the general welfare of
the Indians and cause administra
tions to make miftakos in their
policy of deiling with them. This
man Moorhead also stated in his
letters that the publisher of THE
TOMAHAWK it maintaining a lobby
at Washington in behalf of lumber
interests. The Chippewas of Min
nesota all know why the publisher
has given so much of his time at
Washington every winter, it is
therefore unnecessary for him to
make any explanations to them.
A man who acknowledged himself
susceptible to bribery as we were
reliably informed Moorhead ad
mitted himself to be, is unworthy
of any credence. Mr. Moorhead
is a member of the Board of In
dian Commissioners and this gives
him some prestige, but on account
of his actions while upon this res
ervation and since then, President
Wilson should remove him from
the position he holds-.
Should Ask For Authority
To See And Copy

The members of this reservation
to whom alleged issues have been
charged, should now lose no time
in askiDg Supt. Hinton to let them
examine thei-sue books used since
Supt. Howard has been here up to
ie time of his depaiture.
If this request should be re
fused an appeal should be made to
the Indian office at Washington,
*and even higher if it becomes nec
essary.
STATES
SECTOR, MOSES E.
The time has arrived when the
State of Minnesota should show
itb appreciation of the services
which Senator Clapp has rendered
it, by sending him back to con
tinue to fill the position of United
States senator, which he has filled
since 1901 with so much credit to
himself and the state.
None know better than those
who have been at Washington how
indispensible Senator Clapp is to
his constituents. If the tracks of
Minnesotans could be traced from
the moment of their arrival at
Washington, whenever the.fr go
there on business with Congress
or the departmenter^y^owW iff
almost every instance lead to the,
committee room of Senator Clapp,
where they receive not only good
advice regarding the manner in
which they should proceed in the
matters they may be seeking to
have settled, but likewise valunble
assistance. None of Senator
Clapp's constituents are too in
sijnificarit for him to take off his
coit and assist, and he does this
because of his sympathetic na
ture than for political reasons, for
my who are not his constituents
call upon him for help whenever
they are unable to get it from the
congressmen of their own states.
The Chippewas of Minnesota
owe Senator Clapp a debt of grati
tude, and they shou'd now show
him how deeply they appreciate
what he has done for them since
he has been in the senate by voting
at the next primary election for
hh renomination, and every one
should leave the work he may be
doing to do this on election day.
Attention is called to the Indian
appropriation act for this year, and
thereon will be seen the work of
Senator Clapp for the Chippewas,
but it should be borne in mind
that it is not him but Senator Nel
son who is responsible for the Red
Lake forest amendment that is ou
the bill.
It is also through the assistance
of Senator Clapp that the work of
M. Burch, which plunged the
land titles of this reservation into
chaoi, is becoming cleared and
through him eventually will con
ditions finally be settled upon the
reservation if he remains in the
senate.
Objects To Reimbursable
Appropriations.
Henry Standing Bear, a member' the precedent set by his predeces-
of the Pine Ridge Sioux Reserva-1
tion, in a communication to THE
TOMAHAWK
THE TOMAHAWK
Our correspondent, who was at
Washington when the item for
the General Council, and the ex
penses of the delegations that went
to Washington last winter and this
winter was stricken out, probably
did not expect to see it reinstated
in the bill as was afterwards done,
aud it was immediately following
the objections of Senator Curtis to
the item that his communication
was received.
Regarding the appropriations
for irrigations, they are becoming
ridiculous in the eyes of Congress
men, and the Indians whose funds
have been appropriated year after
year for irrigation projects may
soon see a change in Congress
with respect to these appropria
tions. If Superintendent Hinton
Does His Duty.
The Indian appropriation bill
now pending in Congress, and
which has been favorably report
ed, has a provision therein to es
tablish an electric light plant at
the agency here and in this vil
lage.

tribal funds of other tribes of In

upon the Indian appropriation bill
without being disturbed, or any
questions being raised, as for in

Irrigation projects" is the pet Qf
phrase of designing, prospective pjne Point school house, and there

"able is the word which is inserted
into the Indian appropriation bills
in order to be able to withdraw
moneys from the United States
Treasury, which belong to Indian
tribes, for the benefit of specula
tors.
Reimbursable appropriations are
becoming too common in Indian
legislation, and our good legisla
tors must wake up to this.
Among Indians it would be pre
ferable if the legislators would
make an error in appropriating a
small amount for expenditures that
the Indian owners of the fubds
desire than to appropriate large
sums from the funds of other In
dians, who are opposed to these
appropriations of their funds to be
expended in a manner not benefici

jects on property which will event

speculators.

DANIELS WANTS A JOB.
C. C. Daniels, who until recent
ly disgraced the Department of
ustic
Dy
im
inefficiency and in
Chippewa tribal
affairs, has had the affrontary to
make efforts to become the tribal
attorney for the Chippewas of this
reservation.
With the aid of John R. How
ard, ex-superintendent of this TPS
ervation, a meeting of a handful
Pine Point Indians met at the
passed a resolution to employ C.
C. Daniels as the.tribal attorney
of the Chippewas of Minnesota.
The council was certified to by
Howard and the report stated that
it represented the wishes of the
Chippewas.
As soon as the Pillager bands
heard of this they immediately
telegraphed from Leech Lake,
through the superintendent there,
their protest to the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs.
A protest has also been filed
from this reservation against the
employment of C. C. Daniels. If
no attention is paid to these pro
tests, the matter will reach Con
gress where an investigation will
be asked.
If Daniels was not objectionable
to the Department of Justice and
the administration generally, he
should have been kept in the ser
vice of the government, for at
least twenty-four out of every
twenty five Chippewas upon this

that a council was going to be
held at Pine Point for the purpose
of discussing the employment of
Daniels, and the handful of per
sons who attended it kept the
meeting a secret, and likewise
Howard, whose duty it was to
give a general notice of the pro
posed meeting, which he did not
do.
IMPORTANT BUSINESS
FOR THE GENERAL
COUNCIL
If the Chippewas have kept up
with the times, and there is no
doubt that they have done so, they
must realize how important it is
to make the meeting of the Gen
eral Council during the coming
summer the most important that
has yet been held.
Factions should "bury the
hatchet*" and all join together in a
great meeting. The large major
ity consisting of the progressive
element of the Chippewa reserva
tions can afford to be lenient to
wards their ignorant brethren who
have been controlled by the bad
influence of such men as Moor
head, Burch, Daniels and Howard
during the past five years, but as
these men have all been put out of
business by the departments which
ttiey disgraced, and the actions of
the government has thus exoner
ated those whom they undertook
to persecute and oppress, th1e

Doubtful Promotion,
There is no doubt that the in
formation which the Minneapolis
Journal received, that J. H. Hin
ton had been appointed to the posi
tion of superintendent here, and
that John R. Howard had been
promoted, was from a if interview
with the latter, for the statement
is characteristic of him.
John R. Howard's promotion as
school supervisor is a most doubt
ful one for two reasons, the fit
being that he lacks the necessary
education to hold the position of
supervisor, and the other that
he will be unable to write a re
port, and unless he employs some
one to do his work even the In
dian ollice cannot hold him in the
service.
There is a difference, which is
clearly shown in the manner the
Daniels and Howard cases were
handled, between tho Department
of Justice and the Indian office.
Tho Department of Justice lost
no time in summarily dispensing
with the hervices of an incompe
tent employe who was direlect in
his duties, while Commissioner
Sells instead of letting Howard out
on account of his disqualifications,
transferred him to another posi
tion.
