IS A CANDIDATE
FOR RE-ELECTION
WALTER C. TAYLOR, COMMIS­
SIONER OF INSURANCE, AN­
NOUNCES HIS CANDIDACY
AND PLATFORM.
Bismarck, N. D., April 12.—Walter
XJ. Taylor today formally announced
his candidacy for re-election to the
office of commissioner of insurance,
as follows:
To the Republican Electors of the
State of North Dakota: I am a can­
didate for the office of commissioner
of insurance. I am now serving my
third term in that office, and my can­
didacy is submitted on the ground of
efficient service, faithful attention to
duty, and a desire to further assist
in placing the entire structure of in­
surance on a more substantial basis
in this state. The program I have in
mind calls for the enactment of a
complete and harmonious insurance
code, to take the place of the hodge­
podge of laws, many of them more or
less contradictory, which have been
enacted from time to time since state­
hood.
The state should have supervision of
insurance rates as well as of the. in­
surance companies authorized to
transact 'business therein. This ap­
plies with special force to fire insur­
ance rates, but I believe it should also
be extended to provide regulation of
rates charged by surety companies.
Insurance is a public necessity, no
less than railroad, telegraph and tele­
phone systems. Even more intimately
than any of these utilities it enters
into the very woof and warp of our
social and industrial fabric. It was in
recognition of this fact that the United
States supreme court recently said
that "the business of fire insurance
is so far affected with a public interest
as to justify legislative regulation of
its rates." If re-elected I shall renew
the efforts which were inaugurated in
the last legislature to secure supervis­
ion of rates.
Life insurance is written either on
what is- known as the "legal reserve
basis" or the "assessment plan." So
far as assessment life insurance is
concerned, I believe, its writing should
be confined exclusively to fraternal
benefit societies, and on adequate
rates. There would not seem to be
any legitimate reason or demand for
assessment life associations, and this
state might well follow the example
of other states in expressly exclud­
ing them from its borders. Certainly
the present lack of definition in that
particular should be corrected.
Demands upon the time and atten­
tion of the commissioner of insurance
in examining disputed claims for in­
demnity, under policies of accident and
health insurance, has grown alarming­
ly. Tliis is due to the vague, indefinite
and misleading character of these con­
tracts. Standard forms should be pre­
scribed by legislative enactment, as
in the case of fire insurance and life
insurance.
The state department of insurance is
not merely or primarily a recording
office. The duties devolving upon the
commissioner of insurance are highly
technical,, and call for an intimate
knowledge of the insurance laws and
at least a reasonable degree of admin­
istrative ability. These qualifications
can be acquired, if at all, only by ex­
perience. In this connection attention
is called to the fact that in addition
to the steadily increasing amount of
work devolving upon this office as a
result of the rapid growth of the inr
surance business, the responsibility
and labors of the commissioner of in­
surance have been immeasurably en­
larged from the fact that he has been
charged with supervision of the state
hail insurance fund, the fire marshal
law and the state bonding fynd. It is
true, that the law creating the state
bonding fund is not operative at pres­
ent but it is likely to become effective
within a short time.
The state of North Dakota owes me
nothing. On the contrary I am deeply
indebted to the people of this state
and in that spirit—in the desire to give
better service to our people than it has
been possible for me to give in the
past—my candidacy is submitted.
WALTER C. TAYLOR.
SHAPE TO DO BIG
THINGS FOR MINOT
ASSOCIATION OF COMMERCE IS
MAKING STRONG EFFORT TO
COLLECT UP BACK DUES AND
DO ACTUAL WORK.
A strong effort is being made by
the Secretary of the Minot Associa­
tion of Commerce to collect up all
back dues, so that something really
tangible and good can be done for the
city. So many people do not realize
just what expense an Association of
Commerce has. There are a number
of expenses that cannot be curtailed if
good work is to be done. Then there
are extraordinary expenses that come
up without warning that must be
taken care of in order to not have Mi­
not lose caste among the progressive
cities of the state.
The first of April was the begin­
ning of the second quarter of the year
1916, and on that date it was found
that a large sum of money was owing
the Association from men who are
amply able to pay their obligations. If
this money was all collected in the
Association of Commerce could under­
take almost any ta^k for the good of
Minot, but if it cannot be collected in
the work of the association will have
to linger along about as usual. Every
possible economy is being practiced in
order to keep the funds above the low
water mark. New members are being
secured almost every day by the Min­
ute Men, but the money that is owing
the association furnishes the stumbl­
ing block, and were this removed,
things would be a great deal different
for all concerned, which is every bus­
iness man in the city.
It is urged that all members of the
Association make a special effort dur­
ing the next two or three weeks to
pay up their obligations to the organ­
ization.
Major Person May Be Called to War.
Major E. S. Person, president of
the Union National Bank, will in all
probability take part in the Mexican
troubles as soon as a call is made for
volunteers. The Major's name has
been placed on the list of those who
are eligible to become officers of the
Volunteer troops. In case that the
Major does get into the fray, he will
go as Lieutenant Colonel.
Major Person has been connected
with the military service of his coun­
try for the past 28 years, almost con­
tinuously.
W. E. Towner at this writing is ly­
ing precariously ill at his home in this
city and physicians say there is no
possible hope for his recovery. His
demise may be expected at any time.
Mr. Towner has been suffering from
kidney and heart trouble for months.
WILL GRAVEL MAIM
TRAVELED ROADS
COMMISSIONERS WILL SPEND
AUTOMOBILE MONEY IN GRAY­
ING COUNTY ROADS TOWN­
SHIPS TO PAY HALF THE COST.
The following resolution was passed
by the board of county commisioners
at the April meeting:
Whereas, it is- the opinion of this
board that an effort should be made
to start graveling the main traveled
roads in this county, where gravel can
be obtained handy, and whereas this
board is authorized by law to spend
the Automobile Fund for the main­
tenance of the main traveled roads of
the county.
Be it therefore resolved, that the
automobile money be spent in gravel­
ing the main roads, providing the
townships, by public subscription or
otherwise^ will furnish one half of the
cost, either by work or by cash, and,
Be it further resolved, that this
board meet on the 20th of April to
hear proposals from township boards
in regard to this matter.
THE INDEPENDENT HAS THE LARGEST CIRCULATION OF ANY WEEKLY PAF*ER IN THE STATE
NEW SYSTEM OF
PAiOUNG CARS
Vol. 14: No. 52. Minot, Ward County, North Dakota, Thursday, April 13, 1916 Subscription $ 1 Per Annum
MINOT WILL TRY OUT SYSTEM
USED IN LARGER CITIES OF
THE EAST.
In a few days the police department
will inaugurate a plan of parking au­
tomobiles on Main street that is in
force in many eastern, and for that
matter, western cities.
For some time it has been apparent
that something should be done to do
away with the cluttering up of the
curb with cars that are brought down
town in the morning and remain there
all day. It has been a common cause
for adverse comment upon the part of
those who drjve in from the country
and other towns, that it is almost im­
possible for them to drive up to any
business place in this city on account
of the parking of the Minot cars along
the curb. The new plan provides for
a marked off space in the exact center
of the street, and all cars will then
be run into the center of the street and
stand diagonally across the street.
This will give about seventeen feet
passing space on both sides of the
parked cars, ample room for a car
to pull up to the curb for a moment
to discharge passengers or load pas­
sengers while another car going the
same way can pass easily and safely.
This plan is in force in Chicago,
Omaha, Minneapolis and other met­
ropolitan cities. It is expected that
there will be objections to the plan at
first until the car owners realize that
it has features that beat the old sys
em all hollow. A traffic policeman will
be stationed along Main street and
will assist all car owners in getting
used to the idea.
Press Meeting Was Held.
A meeting of the press association
of Ward county held at the Associa­
tion of Commerce rooms in Minot Fri­
day evening and matters of interest
to the craft-were considered. Arrange­
ments were made to hold another
meeting in this city the latter part of
the month, when some form of social
entertainment will be provided. Mat­
ters of extreme importance to the
publishers and printers will be con­
sidered.
IN J.
FOR RE-ELECTION
POPULAR REGISTER OF DEEDS
IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE SO
FAR FOR THIS OFFICE—SAID
HE WILL HAVE NO OPPOSITION
Holding public office is not always a
pleasant task, but when one can serve
the public in such a manner that the
people are so well satisfied that no op­
position manifests itself, it becomes a
pleasure.
Martin J. Engeseth was elected Reg­
ister of Deeds two years ago. He has
fulfilled every promise that he made
MARTIN J. ENGESETH.
to the voters. He has been found do­
ing his duty every day since he took
his oath of office and doing it excep­
tionally well. Mr. Engeseth should be
re-elected without opposition and it
appears to the Independent that he
will have none. His announcement
appears in this issue.
Case Against Olaf- Olson Dropped.
Mrs. Severion and Mrs. Elliott, who
caused the arrest of Olaf* A. Olson
last week, charging him with assault,
after due consideration, decided to
drop the case. They had started an
action against Mr. Olson's clerk at
the Lexington charging him with slan­
der, but after the attorney for the de­
fense had made inpuiries into the past
of the complainants, they refused to
answer arid said that they were per­
fectly willing to drop both actions.
The women were enroute to Chinook,
Mont. They got into an argument
with the proprietor of the Lexington
over the charge for their lodging and
he refused to let them take their suit
cases. After the women had dropped
the charge, Mr. Olson allowed them to
take their property.
COfERNHENT COPHER
CUT THIS OUT AND SAVE IT,
MIX UP SOME OF THE POISON,
THEN FEED IT TO THE PESTS.
I
The following is the gopher poison
formula recommended by the govern­
ment and tried out so successfully by
W. A. Peck last year.
Mix thoroly one ounce strychnine
alkaloid (powdered), and one ounce
baking soda.
Sift this into three-fourths pint of
thin," hot starch paste and stir to a
creamy mass. The starch paste is
made by dissolving one tablespoonful
of dry gloss starch in a little cold
wateK which is then added to 3-4 pint
of boiling- water. Boil and stir con­
stantly until a thin, clear paste is
formed.
Add one-fourth pint heavy corn
syrup and a tablespoonful of glycerine
oil a id stir thoroly.
Aad one-eighth ounce saccharine
and stir thoroly.
Pour this solution over 20 quarts
cleaii oats and mix thoroly, so that
each' grain is coattfd. Prepare it 24
to 4? hours before using.
For mixing small quantities, an or­
dinary galvanized wash tub is con­
venient. For larger quantities, a
tight, smooth box may be used, and
mixing may be done with a spade.
Aj tablespoonful of poisoned oats
should be placed near each ground
squ^rel hole on clean, hard ground,
lettftig it scatter lightly as it falls.
Do pot put the poisoned grain on loose
dirt' of the mound or into the holes.
Each quart of the poisoned grain is
sufficient to treat about 60 holes.
Be sure to call for strychnine AL­
KALOID, as the other kind is not
recommended for this special purpose.
More Room for Minot Schools.
At a meeting of the board of educa­
tion held Tuesday evening, the crowd­
ed conditions of the various schools
was considered. The board is planning
on engaging a room at the public li­
brary for the coming year, to be used
until the proposed new high school
building is completed. Something
will have to be done.
GOOe MAN FOR
JOHN WALLIN, ONE OF THE
COUNTY'S BEST KNOWN CITI­
ZENS, WOULD TAKE CARE OF
OUR NICKELS AND DIMES.
There probably is no better known
nor a better liked man in Ward county
than "Honest" John Wallin, who as­
pires to the office of county treasurer.
He is a farmer by profession. Many
years ago, in 1883, to be more exact,
lie located on a homestead up the river
a few miles from Minot, where he has
resided since, with the exception of
JOHN WALLIN.
a short period which he spent in Minot.
he has farmed successfully, for he has
been a hard worker and economical.
Mr. Wallin served the county as com­
missioner for ten years during the
early days, and the writer recollects
well that he was ever fearless and
honest in all of his transactions, both
public and private. He was State
Senator from this district in the 1909
and 1911 legislative sessions and lent
valuable assistance in landing the Mi­
not Normal school for Northwestern
North Dakota. He has taken an ac­
tive part in shaping the destiny of the
state, the county and the locality in
which "he resides. He stands for the
best jn social affairs and in politics
and is a firm believer in "a square
deal for all." He is a director ana sec­
retary of the Minot Farmers' Grain
Asociation and is director and vice
president of the Minot Dairy Co., be­
ing an advocate of farmers' co-oper­
ative organizations. Mr. Wallin is
undoubtedly competent to serve the
people as county treasurer.'®*"
Wife Beater Taken to Asylum.
Sheriff H. J. Slaughter of Stanley,
arrived in the city today, bringing
with him Steve Barnak, the Van Hook
farmer, who was arrested for beat­
ing his wife. Barnak was declared in­
sane by the Mountrail county auth­
orities. The sheriff turned the man
over to the state officer, McGillis, who
will take Barnak to Jamestown.
Barnak has been arrested four times
for beating his wife. He would be­
come angry at the least provocation
and give the poor woman a terrible
beating. He spent one whole winter
in the Mountrail county jail for this
and Mrs. Barnak declared that it was
the most enjoyable time she had had
since her married life began. Barnak
lived in a hovel in Mountrail county
and would seldom work. His wife
made the living by taking in washing.
Eight children were born to the cou­
ple, five of whom are living.
The venerable Wm. Hetherton, Sr.,
is seriously ill with pneumonia at his
home in this city. He was reported
resting a trifle easier Tuesday but he
was passing thru the crisis and phy­
sicians could not determine what the
results might be.
CLEAN-UP AND
PAINT# WEEK
FOR CITY OF MINOT
PLANS BEING PERFECTED FOR
SYSTEMATIC CLEANING UP OF
THE CITY.
Monday night at the regular meet­
ing of the City Commission a com­
mittee consisting of Mayor Shaw, O.
M. Pierce and Will E. Holbein was ap­
pointed to plan the details of a clean­
up and paint-up week for Minot in the
near future.
It is expected that a plan similar to
the one used in Cincinnati, Ohio, last
year will be used here, and this plan
calls for special effort for a whole
week upon the part of all property
owners, not only to slick up the city,
but assist in making fire prevention a
reality.
The committee has already started
work, and in a short time the bill
boards about the city will be em­
blazoned with startling posters, and
the shop windows properly placarded
so that "he who runs may read."
This committee will also furnish
some of the publicity for the City
Beautiful forces, headed by the wo­
men's clubs of the city, in fact, will
co-operate with the city, in addition to
some of the fine plans already made
by the city commission.
The funds for the use of this com­
mittee are being provided by the
wholesale and jobbing houses of the
city, all the managers of these houses
being enthusiastic over the project
of the clean-up week.
The railroads will be asked to beau­
tify their right of ways, and it is ex­
pected that both roa'ds passing thru
this city will come across handsomely
in the "matter of beautifying their
grounds.
Overland Cars Sold on National Par­
tial Payment Plan.
The latest periodicals and maga­
zines are all carrying heavy adver­
tisements of the Guaranty Securities
Company, a New York corporation,
who have concluded arrangements so
that Overland or Willys-Knight auto­
mobiles may be sold on the partial
payment plan.
The Minot Auto Company have al­
ready completed arrangements with
the 'Guaranty Securities Company so
that they are enabled to sell Overland
and Willys-Knight cars to anyone for
a small payment down and the balance
in small monthly payments. On ac­
count of the low rate of interest
charged, this is a plan that will appeal
to many prospective purchasers who
possibly might otherwise feel it neces­
sary to wait awhile before they felt
they could afford to place their order
for an automobile.
When one takes into consideration
the remarkable value offered in Over­
land cars, together with the wonder­
ful and unlimited Overland serv'ce
which has been established for the
benefit of Overland owners, and a'so
the fact that these can now be pur­
chased on the partial payment plan,
we are beginning to wonder if there
will be any of us, within the next six
months, who will not have an Over­
land.
Quite an amusing incident happen­
ed at the sho.w the other night when a
young man presumed to be Dan Reilly
attempted to do a gallant act by pick­
ing from the shoulder of one of the
young ladies seated in front of him,
a ravelling, but found to his dismay
that it only had one end, so thinking
it would be unwise to leave it hang­
ing down her back he kept on pulling
until he had enough to start a ball, so
kept right on unnoticed until he found
the other end and then placed it under
his chair so as not to attract atten­
tion. But it happened that when the
young ladies met near the post office
the next day, one said, "How did you
like the show last night?" "Fine,"
she replied, "but do you know, in some
unaccountable way I lost my union
suit."—Kenmare Journal.

share of patronage from the people of
Minot and vicinity.
The proprietor of "The Valet" is

UP SAWYER
STATE'S ATTORNEY SUBPOENAS
THIRTEEN CITIZENS AND IS­
SUES THREE WARRANTS—THE
BIRDS HAVE PROBABLY FLOWN
State's Attorney O. B. Herigstad
went to Sawyer Monday and made an
investigation of the alleged violations
of the prohibition law. He issued
thirteen state's attorney subpoenas
which brot forth sufficient evidence to
justify him in issuing three warrants,
one for Carl Tannihill, one for Gus
Anderson and. a third for the assistant
operator at the Soo. The operator,
who is accused of selling booze at the
depot, left town hurriedly before he
could be served with a warrant and it
is possible that the others have made
their get-away. One of the men ac­
cused is charged with selling liquor
to two school boys, who are under the
age of sixteen. If arrested and con
victed of this offense, it is likely to go
pretty hard with him.
