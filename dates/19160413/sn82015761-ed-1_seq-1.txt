RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY MASS MEETING
AT THE SULTANA THEATER APRIL 10, 1916
Whereas, heretofore, and on the 15th day of August, 1915, at Wil
liams, Coconino County, Arizona, a joint meeting of a committee
selected at a public, people's mass
mittee selected in the same way by
aUU OlLCl UUC UUUDlUCiablUU, 1.11 1 Dam WUJlUimtaj o.v out, jviiik uuvuxug,
considered it advisable, and reeommended;
That in the matter of bond io8ue for public road improvements in
Coconino County, Arizona, the first
such bonds should be expended in th'e construction of a road leading
from the Eastern and terminating at the Western boundary lines of said
County; and that such road should be first constructed, before the con
struction of others; and,
That the amount of such bonds to be issued should be fixed at
$200,000.00; to be sold as funds should be required, until needed im
provements should be completed; and,
That all work in the Construction of such roads, should be let and
done by contract; and,
That for the supervision of the construction of such roads, letting
of contracts therefor, and the expenditure of the moneys, an election
should be held by the people, to elect by them an advisory selection,
of three person?, one from each Supervisoral District within said County,
all to be resident taxpayers, for the appointment to be made by the
Board of Supervisors, with the idea that the Board of Supervisors would
appoint such persons so elected by the people; and,
WHEREAS, on the 8th day of March, 1916, the Board of Super
visors of Coconino County, have called for an election to be held in said
County, on the 2nd day of May, 1916, for the purpose of voting for the
issue of Bonds of said County, for the purpose of construction and re
construction of roads and highways, and for the re-constiuction of
bridges in said County, and creating an indebtedness therefor; but
That no limit is placed upon the said Board of Supervisors, by such
call, as to how, where, when, or in what manner any or all of such
moneys, proceeds of such bonds, should be spent, but that the entire
control thereof is by such call left within the power of such Board of
Supervisors; and, if voted, there would be no legal manner of arresting
or controling any such work or expenditures, no matter how unneces
sarily or needlessly done; and
That said Board of Supervisors, in the making of such call for elec
tion,have wholly ignored each, eve;y and all of the said recommenda
tion of said meeting of said committees, so jointly held;
Tbat the amount of such bonds so to be voted i for, is raised
$50,000.00; and '
That there is not any provision for the letting of work by contract;
and , j 1
That there is no provision allowing the people of the1 several Super
visoral Districts, to have any say as to the persons who should form
such high-way commission, who should determine where, or when, or
in what manner such roads should be built, or how rnuch of such mon
eys should be spent, or in what manner;
A Now, Therefore, be it Resolved: That it is the sense of this meet
ing, and that this meeting does, entirely condemn, and heartily oppose,
the issuance of any Bonds, or the creation of any County indebtedness,
upon any of the terms or conditions as expressed in the said call for
election by said Board of Supervisors; and that we do most urgently
resist the handling and expenditure of any moneys by the Board of
Supervisors of this County, that might be realized from the sale of such
bonds, and their dictation of how, where, when or in what manner such
moneys should be expended;
Hereby recognizing as we do, that the subsequent action of said
Board of Supervisors, apparently appointing a. Highway Commission,
and naming the members thereof, and the specifying of where the said
moneys should be spent, and how much to each place, has not any
binding effect whatever,, but is simply of a wholly misleading char
acter. Advertisement

A Correction Concerning
Teachers Salaries
In publishing the list of teach
ers for the year -1916-17 together
with their respective salaries, in
last week's News, two errors
made as follows:
The salary of Miss Watson was
given as S100 where it should
have been $110, and of Miss
Keating was given as $90 where
it should have been $100.
One of these errors was made
by Prof. Latham in preparing
the copy and the other was made
by the News. That makes a
treat coming each way and so
the News proposes to call it
square.
Notice
This is to notify you that the
stock ordinance will be strickly en
forced. All stock running at large
