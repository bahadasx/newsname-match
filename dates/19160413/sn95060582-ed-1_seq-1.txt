Safe Medicine for Children.
"Is it safe?" is the first ques
tion to be considered when buy
ing cough medicine for children.
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy has
long been a, favorite with mothers
of young children as it contains
no opium or other narcotic, and
may be given to a child as confi
dently as to an adult. It is ple'as
ant to take, too, which is of great
importance when a medicine must
be given to young children, This
remedy is most effectual in re,
leiving coughs, colds and croup.
Obtainable everywhere.
