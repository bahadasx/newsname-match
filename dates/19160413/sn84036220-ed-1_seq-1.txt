Report of Raid, Which May Prove of!
Highest Importance, as It is Be-

the Raiders, Is Received by the Rep-1
resentative at El Paso of One of the
Largest American Mining Concerns
in Mexico and Is Accepted by Hi
as Authentic—Place Raided Is 140
Miles From United States Troops.
KL PASO, Tex., April 12.—A hand
of Villistas numbering; several hun
died, and possibly a thousand, have
sacked Sierra Mojada, five miles
across the Coahutla line and 80 miles
east of Jimlnez, destroying many
thousands of dollars worth of Ameri
can property and looting the town of
everything of value.
This report, which may prove to
he of the highest importance, as i( is
believed that Villa himself was among
tlie raiders, was received today hy the
representative of one of the largest
American mining concerns in Mexico
mid Is accepted by him as authentic.
The bandits made their attack an the
town on April 5. They came from
Kscalon, a junction point on the Mexi
can National railroad, 60 miles south
east of Jiminez and about an equal
distance southwest of Sierra Moja
da. which was its connection with the
Mexican Northern railway. On their
wuy to (.'terra Mojada they sacked the
small town of Cirrilo.
The belief that Villa himself may
he directing the operations of the ban
dits is supported by a report received
today from Ojinaga stating that Col
onel Riojas, the commander there,
had information that Villa had
doubled in his tracks and was 200 miles
southeast of that place.
Ojinaga is directly across the bor
der from Presidio, Texas, and about
I ">0 miles north of Sierra Mojada.
Another circumstance tlmt gives
color to this location of the bandit
is the fact that Canuto Reyes, at the
head of a large number of men, was
reported from Torreon a week ago to
be traveling north in the direction of
Sierra Mojada. It was the belief at
the time in Torreon that Villa's no
torious ally was on his way to join
the brigand-in-chief. If it proves
true, Villa has completely evaded the
American troops who have been driv-l
ing south at an amazing speed and
are today reported, from the most re
liable sources, to be well south of Par
ral an very close to the Durango bor
der.
Sierra Mojada is 140 miles east of
Ihe nearest point at which American
troops are known to be.
MAY ASK FOR MILITIA.
SAN ANTONIO, Tex., April 12 —
Unless the work of the punitive ex
pedition in Mexico is accomplished
within a few days, means will be
sought to strengthen General Persh
ing's force at the front, it was authori
tatively stated tonigh. It is expect
ed that General Funston will ask the
war department to move into the
southern department the 4.000 troops
that are stationed at other points In
the United States. If this is done
these will be placed on duty along
the border, relieving for service in
Mexico a part of the 20,000 men now
doing garrison and patrol duty along
tlie frontier. If the war department
regards tlie transfer of troops not now
in the department inexpedient, it is
believed that General Funston will
recommend using the militia to re
lieve the troops along the border.
Whether the somewhat vague un
derstanding entered into between tlie
American officers and Carranza au
thorities for tlie movement of supplies
consigned as ordinary ferlght, is a
success, was considered doubtful in
some quarters, but by headquarters
officials it was deemed worthy of
trial.
If higher officials in Mexico do not
interfere witli tlie arrangement, it
was recognized that it will go far to
wards alleviating a situation that
quartermaster department officials
had regarded as rapidly becoming
acute, but since the request fur the
use of the railroads was asked the
military situation has so changed mil
itary men declare that even greater
use of the railroads must be had if
Ihe campaign against the bandit chief
and his thousands of followers is car
ried to a logical finish.
Reports reached General Funston
from El Paso late today that a train
of supplies left Juarez for Chihuahua
this afternoon under the new arrange
ment.
General Funston continued without
information today as to the location
of the advanced cavalry detachments,
and no reports supplied additional In
formation concerning the where
abouts of Villa or the state of liis
j
health In the absence of definite 1,
information, General Funston was not

Main street seems to be the communi
ty s gain, for tentative plans are now
under way whereby the finest office
building yet within the hopes of this
city, will be erected upon tlie site men
tioned. It is proposed that this build
ing shall be five or six stories in height
and entirly fireproof, of concrete and
steel groundwork, a handsome substan
tial structure which will he at once un
edifice of pride and practical value to
the community at large.
Interests Back of Plan.
Tlie new building will be ercted by
the Bank of Fergus county, the Mon
tana Hardware company and associat
ed interests. It will front 100 feet on
Main street and will extend 90 feet
on Third avenue, including the corner
now occupied by tlie Montana Hard
ware store, and what was formerly the
Bijou theater and the Hub Clothing
store. The actual outlay which tlie
finished structure will represent has
not been precisely estimated as yet,
but will mean perhaps the biggest
single building expenditure ever made
in Lewistown.
Bank on Corner.
As it now is outlined, tne Bank of
Fergus county will occupy the comer
of'th7 building now teimriteiT by * the
Montana Hardware company, and the
lattor firm will occupy the space re
cently destroyed hy fire. The
mainder of tlie building will probably
be devoted to office rooms, altnough
there lias been little discussion of de
tails, so far. Applications for space
have alreudy been received, in fact
there are enough of these on file at
present to fill one entire Door of tlie
projected building.
Money Is Subscribed.
There is little or nothing more deft
nite to say regarding this new strue

necessary funds have been nubscri't

Because of Die drizzling rain that
prevailed most of Tuesday, tlie
nuul "clean-up" was not as successful

being less rubbish hauled off than

TREES ATCIIYPARK SHORTLY
As soon as the weather permits and
• lie $300 worth of trees and shrub
bery which huve been ordered, arrive,
improvement work will begin on the
municipal park. Flans for tills park

be no delay in carrying these plans
to completion. The city engineering
department will do all that is possible
to make this a park worthy of the

end of it there will soon be enough
shade there to warrant park benches,
which, of course, are primarily essen
