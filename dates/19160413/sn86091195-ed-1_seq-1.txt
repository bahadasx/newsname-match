DEATH OF
HENRY FISHER
Last Friday Henry Fisher and George
Stone, two well-known Reservation In
dians who have for a long time been
addicted to the excessive use of booze,
paid Pocatello a visit and from all
accounts succeeded in getting full of
bootleg whiskey. Saturday morning
found Stone in the bastile and Fisher
in the morgue. Fisher's body wa
found on the railroad tracks by a
colored hotel porter who reported his
ghastly discovery to the police, who had
it removed to the morgue. Both legs
and one arm were cut off, and his head
was lacerated almost beyond descrip
tion, but his face was not disfigured
beyond identification. Ralph Dixey
hurried to Pocatello when he heard
the sad news and identified Fisher. De
ceased was born on the Reservation
thirty years ago, and was an intelli
gent, industrious Indian when sober.
He was not married, and leaves an
estate consisting of a farm and stock
valued at about $8,000. His remains
were interred in the Reservation ceme
tery this afternoon at 3 o'clock under
the direction of the Rev. Wagner, the
resident Presbyterian minister of the
Reservation mission.
Jesse Adams, a colored boy, is held
by the sheriff's office of Pocatello for
selling Henry Fisher the liquor that
made him drunk and caused him to lose
his life.
EDITOR EMBRACES ART.
Jap Toner, Bingham County's lonely
Democratic editor, says lie has abandon
ed the cause of Democratic journalism
for a more lucrative calling. He has
embraced the art line and will become
a vender of oil paintings of the Great
Masters, among whom no doubt will be
classed Mose and Woodrow. Jap seems
fickle on everything we know of but pol
itics, but in this ungrateful and unprofit
able calling he seems to be a Democrat
bred, a Democrat born, and a Democrat
until he dies.

who were perishing with thirst for want
of the hilarious stimulation of John |
Barleycorn. Upon his arrival he was !

office who found his grip bounteously

must have been greatly disappointed I
when the officer took him and his |

full membership present and Mayor
Peck presiding.
The reports of City Attorney Thomas
and Attorney J. W. Jones on the legal

city for municipal purposes were read
and discussed, which reports were both
favorable and unfavorable to the pur

River. Councilinen Thompson, Berry

' SUGAR COMPANY'S
ANNUAL MEETING

! The annual meeting of the stock

pany Was held Monday afternoon in the
Vermont building. À large number of
stockholders were present in person or
I by proxy,
| President's Report
Reports from the president, general
manager and secretary and treasurer
were read, President Smith's statement
being as follows:
To the stockholders of the Utah-Ida
ho Sugar company.
I take pleasure in submitting here
with the annual reports of the com
pany 's operations for the fiscal year,
lending February 29, 1916. These re
I ports speak for themselves and are of a
j nature which must give cause for mu
tual congratulations to all interested
in the company.
I The steady growth of the sugar in
dustry in Utah and Idaho is a matter
I of deep gratification, and one in which
; the community may justly feci a pride
i as no industry, I am aware of surpassés
j it in its direct benefits to the people
at large, ami especially to those in the
I agricultural districts.
] It is also a pleasure to note that the
j increased prosperity of the company
has enabled it to make advances from
time to time in the rates paid to beet
growers. For the past several years,
the company has made increases in the
price of beets in various locations, and
during the last season, the sum of $65,
000 was distributed among the farmers
as a bonus over the contract prices
agreed upon. For the coming year, for
the first time, a new scale will be
adopted in the payment of beets based
on their sugar contents, which will re
sult in a substantial increase to the
growers.
This principle of sharing our pros
polity, with the producers of the beets,
is one that the company recognizes as
just, and is one that the officers of
the company will take pleasure in ad
vocating in the future, as business cun
ditions may justify.
All must be aware that the sudden
change in the condition of the indus
try, from one of great depression,
to one of prosperity, has been due to
the war, and I feel sure the stock
holders will agree with the board of
directors in their policy of strength
ening the company's reserves ami
protecting itself at all points possible,
against a recurrence of adverse con
ditions. Even now, the pending legisla
tion emphasizes the need of great care,
nml threatens to continue the uncer
tainties in the past. Should th p time
come, when the industry can rely on
a settled and definite poiicy on the part
of the .government, it will justify sugar
companies in extending still further
recognition to beet producers.
The detailed reports of our coin
pane's assets and liabilities, receipts
and expenses, and the outlook for the
coming season, are fully set forth in
the reports of the general manager,
and the secretary and treasurer, sub
mitted herewith.
Very Trulv yours,
JOSEPH F. SMITH,
President.

OVERLAND NEWS,
"The cost of gasoline is one of the
less important items to the prospective
purchaser of an automobile whose aim

one of the most prominent manufactur
ers ot automobiles in the world. He
bases his argument on the declaration
that the modern car of today is so com
plete in its equipment and so reduced
in its price that these features entirely
offset any increase in gasoline cost
which has developed or may develop.
I he automobile buyer would ease
his mind materially about gasoline
prices by taking into consideration other
teatures involved in the purchase of a
modern ear,''said John N. Willv

automobile history. It is true that
gasoline costs a few cents more this
\ear than last year, but a comparison
of these few cents with the dollars saved
in purchase price makes the gasoline
question seem trivial.
"In our Model 75 we are today giv

BLACKFOOT'S BIG GARAGE.
When the Watson garage is completed
in a few weeks Blaekfoot can trulv
boast of having the largest and one of
the best equipped garages in southeast
ern Idaho. It is all on the ground
floor, 140x50, with a ground space of
7,000 feet that will accomodate seventy
five automobiles. The fact that Mr.
Watson owns and personally superin
tends and assists in the running of this
enormous garage will not only enable
him to give auto owners the very
lowest possible rates for earing for
their machines, but the additional and
undisputed fact that he is an expert
mechanician in his line is a guarantee
that his repair work will be both rea
sonably ami promptly done. He does
not sell ears, but makes a specialty of
repairing all makes of autos, and guar
antees his work or no money until all
work is done to the entire satisfaction
of all customers. In addition to extra
good accomodations, skilled workman
ship and honest, courteous treatment,
Mr. Watson is in a position to offer the
automobile trade the most, generous
terms for keeping and repairing cars.
DEADLY PORK AND BEANS.
Last Saturday afternoon Arthur Stef
fins, aged 31 years and a native of
Sweden, was buried from the undertak
ing parlors of Brown & Eldridge. De
ceased was the son-in-law of Mrs. Sarah
E. Williams, who has a small farm
about a mile and a half southeast of
Blaekfoot, which she manages herself.
Deceased's relatives insist that his
death was caused by eating a mess of
pork and beans which also poisoned his
wife and six-months old nursing baby,
but the latter fwo have recovered.
After eating thé alleged fatal mess of
pork anil beans about two weeks ago,
deceased was never able to eat anything
or leave his bed until death relieved
him of his suffering. Dr. Hoover, who
attended him, states that deceased's
death was caused by something lie had
eaten.

HIS AMBITION
IS SATISFIED
Few men who have been in politics as
long as James Christenson of Taylor has
been,can quit as easily or as voluntarily
as he is going to at thrf end of his pres
ent term. He says that he has been
elected twice as county commissioner,
and believes some other citizen of his
district should be willing to further
serve the dear people in that office,
when liis present term expires. We
are informed that there are three or
four citizens of Commissioner District
No. 1 who are ready and anxious to suc
ceed Mr. Christenson, among them being
Bishop Anderson of Jameston and Bish
op Rider of Woodville. The latter
claims that his own town has never
been represented on the board of coun
ty solons, or in any other political man
ner, and thinks the time has arrived
for the desired recognition.
That Mr. Christenson has made an en
viable reputation for economy and hon
esty as a public servant all unprejudiced,
responsible citizens will admit, but he
has done so at a great loss to his person
al business, the penalty all men have
paid who have gone before him as a suc
cessful county commissioner.
Hotel and Other Improvements.
$25,000 has been raised to givo
Blaekfoot an up to date hotel, and the
site chosen for it is on the southwest
corner of Pacific anil Taylor streets,
now owned by the Hopkins brothers.
The 118 front feet of h nul adjoining
this property on the south has also been
selected by the Eceles Investment com
pany, who are the chief factors in the
erection of the new hotel. Upon this
property, which belongs to the King
estate and which is under the care of
Attorney Jones, will be erected business
buildings, making a solid block of build
ings from the hotel corner to the First
is .1 : in".i 1 l ank annex.
The 72V4 feet of property on Taylor
street opposite the property of the new
hotel site and owned by the Standrod
Bank, lias been bought by the Hopkins
brothers and Leo Henish, who will erect
business buildings thereon.
Blaekfoot now has a professional dog
catcher who hails from Baker City,
Oregon. He seems to be posted on the
legal and practical ends of making
dog owners pay their license or having
their canines executed in a legal man
ner. JTliis week he collected about
$id.ftrt of license money and rid the
city of quite a band of ownerless dogs
by hypodermic injections of cold lead.
