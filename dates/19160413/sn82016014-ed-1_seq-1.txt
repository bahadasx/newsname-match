Washington, April 13. In of

American troops will not be

and that while the question is
being discussed with General
Carranza the pursuit of the Villa

Bands Not Broken Up?
Secretary Baker of the war depart
ment said he was unable to comment
upon General Carranza's note because
ii lain t J questions of administration
poHcy entirely within the jurisdiction
of ihe president and the s-tate depart
ment. Although General Carranni raised
vide issues, administration officials at
their first view of the communica
tion regarded the principal contention
M betas that the object of the puni
iie expedition has. been accomplished
so far as it can be, and that th Villa
hands have been dispersed. War de
partment officials take the view that
they have no evidence that Villa
bands have been dispersed, because
they never had definite information of
their number and that the very nature
of the sit nation gives no evidence the
raiders have been exterminated.
Mexican Anibawulor Silent.
Kliseo Arredondo, Mexican ambas
sador designate, declined to discuss
early today General Carranza's note
concerning withdrawal of the Ameri
can troops from Mexico. At the em
ll 1 it was said the official text was
being translated and would be imme
diately taken to the state department
when completed by the translators.
Some state department officials
Confessed that General Carranza's
note was not a surprise. Counselor
Polk confirmed the statement in the
note that when he asked for use of
i he Mexican railways the reply was
'satisfactory" but was coupled with
an expression of surprise that the
1'nlted States had not awaited final
approval of the pending protocol be
fore sending troops across the border.
I- Carranza's First Protest.
1 1 was declared, officially however,
that no formal protest against the en
try of General Pershing's columns
had been previously made by General
Cairanza. When the advance troops
crossed Si Columbus, it was officially
Stated a Carrnnwi general met them
at t he border and made no protest
either personally or on behalf of his
government. State department offi
cials took the view that General Car
ranza's note was not a demand for
immediate withdrawal of the forces
hut an invitation to begin negotiations
to limit their stay. Counselor Polk
conferred with Major General Scott,
chief of staff, and announced that the
negotiations w.uld be handled exclu

CLASH AT PARRAL
U. S. Troops In Some Kind of
Trouble, Says Report.
Encounter Either With Be Fac
tos or Civilians, Is Belief.
San Antonio, April 13. Advices re
ceived at department headquarters.
Fort Sam Houston, today state that
American forces have had an encoun
ter with either Mexican military forces
or the civilian population of Parral.
No details are available.
The report came to General Fun
ston from American Consul Fletcher.
It stated that Major Gutierrez, com
mander at Parral, said there was i
clash, which he termed unimportant,
between American forces and the
troops of the garrison, or residents of
Parral.
The Americans entered the town
with the intention of marching j
through en route southward, an ex- ;
change of shots followed. The infer
ence is that the Americans continued
to march through the town. They
probably were the troops under Major
Tompkins.
Gutierrez minimized the affair, say
ing the Americans appeared suddenly,
unheralded, and the Mexicans were
alarmed.
BATTLE SUBSIDES
Lull Spreads Over Entire Ver
dun Battlefield.
Pause While Germans Fill Up
Gaps in Ranks.
Paris. April 1 3. Another lull has
fallen on the "Verdun battle field as
the Germans have been obliged to
pause in order to fill up the gaps in
their ranks, to replace damaged guns
and to bring up munitions preparatory
to further onslaughts.
It is believed the French command
Is not likely to modify its methods.
General Petain is said to be quite sat
isfied as long as the Germans go on
losing three times as many men as the
French for unimportant results as he
knows that he has ample reserves to
press a counter attack on a large scale
when the opportune time comes, and
stocks of ammunition which are prac
tically inexhaustible.
Since the first month of the war the
output of the three inch shells in
France increased 33 H times. Twenty
three times as many 75-millimetre
guns are being made as in August.
1914. and the manufacture of heavy
guns has increased in the same ratio.
Planned Attack Withheld.
Paris, April 13. Calm prevailed in
the whole region of Verdun last niht,
this morning's official statement says.
"Preparation was made by the Ger
mans for an attack on hill 304 but the
attack was prevented by the French
from being carried into effect. No
other important developments were
j reported at the front.
German Drive Defeated.
Parte, April 12. The German gen
! oral attack on the left bank of the
: Meuse which began on Sunday is re
! garded as having been beaten and the
i Germans have reverted to the pre-
vious relatively small alternate strokes
against the French positions on both
. sides of the river and to artillery oper-
ations.
j When the remaining French pro
I Sections along Forges brook had been
straightened out the Germans were
able to engage the principal line west
1 of the rK-er from Avocourt bv Hill
l number 304 and Deadman's Hill to
' Cumieres. Only frontal attacks under
! difficulties were possible except at
; Deadman's Hill, where the Germans
were able to attack through the ra
vines. They tried to force a passage
between Deadman's Hill and Cumieres
and to work around the south of the
j hill in order to envelop it.
After two days of hard fighting this
(maneuver failed and with it is be
lieved to have collapsed the main idea
of that particular German attack. The
small gain which the Germans made
northeast of the hill Is not regarded as
i of a nature to modify the situation.

ALREADY PROBING GASOLINE
Call on Chicago Prosecutor of
Famous Trust Case.
Attorney General Withholds
Evidence He Has Collected.
Washington, April 13. Attorney
General Gregory, responding to Sen
ator Kenyon's resolution calling for
the results of the department of justice
investigation into the working of the
Standard Oil dissolution told the sen
ate today that it would be incom
patible with public interest to disclose
the information at this time.
Probe Dissolution.
The attorney general's refusal was
regarded as forecasting some develop
ment in connection with the recent
rise in the price of gasoline. Depart
ment officials recently have been in
frequent consultation with Charles B
Morison of Chicago, who took part In
prosecuting the dissolution suit
against the Standard Oil company and
is said to have conducted investiga
tion since the dissolution of the trust,
on behalf of the department to deter
mine whether the so-called subsid
iaries have violated the anti-trust law
since the decree was entered.
The department investigations are
said to have disclosed that the so
called Standard Oil companies are not
competing, that the stock ownership r,f
the companies has not materially al
tered since the dissolution decree and
that they are virtually all controlled
today by the same group of men who
controlled the old Standard Oil com
pany of New Jersey. Government of
ficials have regarded the dtssolution
decree as fundamentally defective in
that it permitted the same group of
men who controlled the oil trust to
control the companies into which it
was separated.
New Investigation On.
Inasmuch as the decree permitted
an unchanged ownership, present of
ficials of the department have con
fined their efforts largely to determ
ining whether any new violations of
the law were involved by the com
panies. Reports that Mr. Morrison
had been commissioned by the depart
ment to undertake a new investigation
of the Standard Oil companies to de
termine whether the rise in the price
of gasoline, warranted prosecutions
have been persistent for ten days. De
partment officials refused today to
comment on these reports, although it
was admitted Mr. Morrison had been
in consultation at the department re
cently. The attorney general's office has
been investigating the gasoline price
increase, however, largely through the
federal trade commission and has
been in frequent consultations with
members of the commission.

KANSAS EQUAL
SUFFS ARE IN
TOPEKA TODAY
Women From Over State Here
for Annual Convention.
Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt Prin
cipal Speaker of Day.
BACK TO THEIR ORIGINAL NAME
Delegates Abandon Former Ti
tle, Good Citizenship League.
Committees Are Named Men's
Day at Commercial Club.
The Kansas Equal Suffrage associa
tion is having its annual convention in
Topeka today. The principal speakers
are Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, of New
York, international head of the Suf
frage alliance, and Governor Arthur
Capper.
The sessions include one for the
morning, and one for the afternoon.
There will be no evening meeting. The
meetings are held in Memorial hall,
and this noon the members of the
convention took luncheon at the Y.
W. C. A.
The business of the session included
a change of the name of the organiza
tion. For years It was called the
Kansas Equal Suffrage association,
and then after the passage of the
state amendment, granting the ballot
to women in Kansas, the club was re
organized, under the name of the
Kansas Good Citizenship league. For
several years it has borne that name,
and at today's session the name was
again changed to the original one, the
Kansas Equal Suffrage league. The
association is affiliated with the Na
tional American Woman's Suffrage
association, and the Kansas branch
gives that national league its endorse
ment and support.
The Shawnee County Political Sci
ence club, which Is the local organiza
tion of the Kansas branch, haf sent
money to the national, to assist in the
campaigns it has conducted in eastern
states, and it endorses its methods of
obtaining suffrage through the state
by state campaigns and through work
for the passing of a federal amend
ment. Explains- Factions.
The principal address of the mora-,
ing was made by Mm. Catt, who is
making a tour of the country In the
Interests of suffrage work, especially
on behalf of the federal amendment.
In an explanation of the differences
between the tactics of the National
American Equal Suffrage association
and those of the Congressional union,
Mrs. Catt said : "The policy of the
Congressional union in working for
the federal suffrage amendment is
partisan, and that of the old suffrage
association is non-partisan. Their
method is that of a faction of the
English woman anti-government. As
the construction of our government is
different from that of the English, the
.National believes that the anti-government
policy will not be successful. It
requires a two-thirds vote in congress
to pass an amendment.
"There has been no party in power
since the reconstruction period of the
South that had that large a majority
in congress, and it is unlikely there
will be. If anyone tells you that the
amendment can be won in the pres
ent congr-eas, that person either does
not understand the situation, or she
is giving out some of the sort of talk
that we are all more or less prone to
give, that we will win when we know
we won't.
"Supposing there is a great Repub
lican sweep at the next election; there
will then not be probably the required
majority. The Democrats will be un
alterably opposed to a woman's party
that fought them. Moreover, there
are . many Republicans who are
pledged to tight the amendment when
ever it appears. After that, there will
be Democratic states to win. and the
fight would be that much harder if the
women had systematically opposed the
party.
"Elihu Root has said that women
may some time vote, but he hopes he
will not live to see- that day. Thirty
six states must ratify the federal
amendment. No amount of heckling
a congressman will make him vote
right unless he has the strength of
his constituency behind him, and it
becomes necessary for us to educate
his constituency.
What Kansas Can Do.
"There are two things that the
women of Kansas can do to help us.
You can unite with other suffrage
states in insisting that your represen
tatives not only vote for the amend
ment, but push it and get it before the
body; they can ask that all their
parties put the suffrage plank in their
I piaiiorm, ana tne second request I
, make is that you send a large delega
tion to Chicago and St. Louis to the
; demonstrations the women will have
in those cities. We want hundreds
of Kansas women in our parade, and
we want the Kansas women to go to
; St- Louis to speak from automobiles
and to have charge of one of the meet
ings of the convention we are going
to have there prior to the Democratic
' national convention."
Mrs. Catt explained a great deal of
j the history of the federal amendment,
j and of suffrage work in the United
States, bringing out the governmental
; machinations to sidestep the issue, and
suggesting ways to circumvent the
! political schemes that have kept it
, from coming to a vote.
"It is important," Mrs- Catt con
I tinued, "that people should not con
I fuse the prohibition and the suffrage
! questions, as is done in manv states.
Certain interests are fighting both, and
we have to insist that the two be
j kept distinct always."
Governor Arthur Capper made an
J address, in which he told of the su
j perlority of Kansas, and the part that
j women had taken m bringing about
i the happy results he described.

WILL DEMAND PROMPT ACTION
Kaiser's Note Strengthens Case
of United States.
No Other Ship Sunk in Channel
as Note Points Ont.
Washington, April 13. The Ger
man note on the Sussex and other sub
marine cases has been received at the
state department and was being de
coded today. It probably will be laid
before President Wilson and Secretary
Lansing before night.
The affidavits from Paris and Lon
don expected today on the liner St.
Paul will be considered in connection
with the German note and the "in
formation," regarding attacks on mer
chant vesee'.s since the Lusitania dis
aster, is expected to be completed in
time to go to Berlin within the next
week. WTille the entire plans of the
administration are not being disclosed,
it is understood that nothing less than
some positive evidence of Germany's
good faith to fulfill the assurances
phe has given the United States, such
as. possibly, substantial punishment of
the submarine commander who de
stroyed the Sussex, can prevent the
situation between the two countries
from coming to the pass which diplo
mats have struggled for the las year
to avoid.
Not an Ultimatum. But
The use of the word ultimatum in
connection with the document to be
forwarded to Berlin is discouraged by
officials, still it was said the effect of
the communication would be to call
for prompt action. In view of the
conclusive nature of the information
on the Sussex already before the state
department, officials cannot see how
Germany can continue to deny re
sponsibility for the dynamiting of the
ship.
The suggestion of arbitration in the
German note was met with the state
ment that the American government
would not arbitrate a question in
volving American lives. The same
statement was made during the Lusi
tania negotiations. Careful examina
tion of the Germain note led officials
to conclude that the case of the United
States had been materially strength
ened. The similarity between the cir
cumstances surrounding the attack on
a steamer in the English channel ad
mitted in the German note and those
surrounding the Sussex case caused
officials to feel there no longer is any
doubt that the vessel was the Sussex.
Senators and representatives who
called at the White House went away
with the impression that action was
Imminent but that another communi
cation would he sent to Berlin before
more drastic steps were taken.
Consider Proof Positive.
London. April 13. Positive proof
that the Sussex was torpedoed was
seen by British officials today in the
German admission that an unidenti
fied steamer was attacked by a sub
marine in the same place and at prac
tically the same time the channel
liner was attacked.
It i. officially stated that no other
vessel was torpedoed in the channel
at the time mentioned in the German
note.
The Sussex was attacked at 3:50
p. m. on March 24. The German note

According to the French official re
port, the Sussex was south of Dun
geness buoys and about in mid-channel
when the explosion occurred. The
German note says the vessel attacked
was south of Dungeness buoys and
about in midchannel when she was
torpedoed.
The Sussex was steaming at about
16 knots per hour.

Paris, April 1 3. The French gov

shot against the Sussex, but also the
names of the captain and members
of the crew of the attacking German
submarine, it was officially announced
today.
This information, the Paris bureau
stated, was obtained from the officers
and crew of a German submarine
captured April 5.

New York. April 13. Detectives
who yesterday arrested four Germans
charged with placing bombs on ships
carrying war munitions to the en
tente allies today sought evidence in
volving a well known German who is
alleged to have supplied a $10,000
i fund to finance the fire bomb con

J of the chemist who aided in the man-
ufacture of the bombs. The name of
neither or tnese men nas neen reveaiea
by the police.
Four employees of the Hamburg
American line and North German
Lloyd Steamship company here are
under arrest charged with attempting
I arson either in making bombs or tak-
ing part in the conspiracy. They are
I Ernest Becker, an electrician of the
j steamer Kaiser Friedrich der Grosse-
Captain Charles von Kliest, superln-
tendent of the New Jersey Agricultu
! ral and Chemical company of Hobo-
ken, N. J. ; Captain Otto Wolpert, su
perintendent of the Atlas line piers of
the Hamburg-American company, and
Captain Enno Bode, superintendent of
the Hamburg-American line piers, in
Hoboken.
Preparations were made to arraign
them in a Brooklyn court today to an
swer the specific charge of placing
bombs in sugar bags on board the
steamer Kirk Oswald on May 2, 1915.
The steamer caught fire from bomb
explosions while on her way to Mar-
i seilles. France. Unexploded bombs
were found in her cargo after her ar-
rival there.
I Police Captain Thomas Tunney re
gards the arrest of the four prisoners
as the most important stride yet made
in the detection of a great conspiracy
to destroy steamships sailing with war
munitions. The police believe the men
involved have been responsible for
fires. on at least 33 steamers that have
caused $4,000,000 damages. They as
sert they have evidence that bombs
made in a Koboken factory ostensibly
operated for the manufacture of fer
tilizer were sent to all parts of the
country. Detectives asserted today
that one of the prisoners said he had
been sent to the factory in Hoboken
by Captain Franz von Papen, former
military attache of the German em
bassy at Washington, who was recalled
at the request of the United States.
Both Becker and von Kliest are
said by the police to have confessed
making the bombs.
Plotters Quarrel Undoing.
Discovery of the plot was brought
about, according to the authorities of
Hoboken through the discontent of a
man who had quarreled with the
I leaders over money payments. The
j Hoboken authorities said that the
j man whose identity Is withheld, told
i them that Captain Boy-Ed. the Ger
i man naval attache In Washington,
and Captain Von Papen, the military
attache, had before their departure
I from the United States filed a large
pum of money at the disposal of the
bomb makers.

STATE JOURNAL IS SUED
Crawford's Bring Suit for $25,000,
Charging "Malicious Libel."
The Amusement Syndicate, a cor
poration through which L. M. Craw
ford and Roy Crawford conduct the
theatrical business of the Grand Opera
house, last night filed suit against
Frank P. Mac Lennan, editor and pro
prietor of the Topeka State Journal,
alleging "malicious libel" and asking
the court for judgment in the sum of
$25,000.
The suit is alleged to be brought
because of an article published Tues
day, April 11, 1916, In the Noon, Home
and Postscript Editions, which are de
clared to have large circulation in
Topeka, concerning the condition of
the Grand theater from the standpoint
of safety to patrons of the place.
Copies of the newspapers containing
the statements were attached to the
petition, which was filed in the Shaw
nee county district court.
Five thousand dollars is asked for
the loss of gains which would have
accrued to the business of the com
pany, $10,000 for depreciation in the
value of the property by reason of the
publication of the article, and $10,000
for punitive damages. In part the
petition says:
"That said defendant knew that said
words were false and untrue, and ut
tered and published the same mali
ciously and for the express purpose of
injuring said plaintiff in its business,
and to injure its property.
"That said words and statements
made in the above editions of said the
Topeka State Journal were false and
untrue and were intended to, and did,
convey the impression and meaning to
the patrons and customers of this
plaintiff that the property of plaintiff
aforesaid was wholly unfit for the pur
pose of giving theatrical performances
and other entertainments, and that the
same had been, and was, condemned,
and that plaintiff was forbidden t.i
use the same, and that the public gen
erally could not. and should not, pa
tronize the said business of plaintiff
or enter Its property, which meaning
and impression was false and untrue,

Note To Be Delivered to Sec
retary Lansins: Today.
Mexico City. April 13. The Mexican
government has sent to its ambassa
dor In Washington a note to be deliv
ered at 10 o'clock this morning to
Secretary Lansing asking that the
American troops he withdrawn from
Mexican territory and the pursuit of
Villa be left to the Mexican constitu
tionalist army.
In the note the de facto government
of Mexico contends that as the Ameri
can troops crossed into Mexico with
out permission they should be with
drawn until a proper formal compact
can be entered into between the two
governments. It is insistently affirm
ed that the previous notes of the Mex
ican government especially empha
sized the fact that permission for
reciprocal crossing the border would
be granted only in the event of the
repetition of a raid similar to that
made by Villa at Columbus, N. M.
What the Note States.
The note was sent to Eliseo Arre
dondo. the Carranza representative in
Washington, with Instructions for its
delivery to Secretary Lansing, end
ing negotiations for a reciprocal pass
ing of troops and asking for rtisneeu
patlon of the territory occupied by
American troop In view of Villa's
party having been destroyed.
Throughout the note, emphasis it
laid on the fact that the American
expedition was undertaken under a
misunderstanding. Although acting In
good faith, the declaration is made
that the Cnited States had interpreted
the first note of the de facto govern
ment as effecting a definite agreement
between the two nations. But the in
tention of the government was that no
expedition should be sent into Mexico
until terms and conditions relative to
an agreement were defined.
Treaty Note Conclude!.
The note declares, therefore, that In
consequence of no final agreement
having been reached as to the terms
of the treaty to regulate the reciprocal
passage of troops over the dividtnjr
line, "the Mexican government judge
it convenient to suspend for the pres
ent all discussion or negotiations In
this particular or founded on the cir
cumstances that expedition sent by tha
United States government to pursun
Villa Is without foundation in virtue
of the nonexistence of a previous
agreement formal and definite."
What was intended by the note of
March 10, it Is pointed out. was to
submit a proposal, "by means of which
the forces of one and the other coun
try could reciprocally cross the divid
ing line In pursuit of ba-ndlts if un
fortunately there should be repeated
along the border acts like those com
mitted in Columbus."
Misinterpreted Mex. Note.
The note adds, however:
"From the beginning the Mexican
government judged that by reason of
the time which had transpired and for
the purpose treating a case already
passed the said incident could not
continue as a proposal for the recipro
cal passage of troops.
The fact that the TTnlted States had
incorrectly interpreted the note nf
March 3 0. was called to the attention
of the Washington government, the
statement points out, in a note dated
March 17. This note likewise empha
sized that the passage of troops would
be permitted, "only If. unfortunately
from this time forward, there rhould
repeated int r rrupt ions iike the one
