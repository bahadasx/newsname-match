A Letter From Rev. W. F. Cole
The followiug letter from Rev. W.F.
Colo will prove Interesting reading to
his many friends in this vicinity:
Al,A5iOS., Coi.o., April 5, 1010.
Dear Friends:
I wish to write to my many friends
in Red Cloud thru the columns of your
paper.
First I want to thank you for the
many visits I have had in the past with
the friends thru your' paper. We have
all enjoyed the weekly visits that it
has made ever since we first struck
Red Cloud. I am very sorry that I
did not get to Red Cloud once, more be
fore Jeaviug the state. I had thought
I would but I became so much worse
that I was afraid to stay nuy longer.
First I presume that you would Tike
to know just where we are. We are
just about In the center of the state
east and west and about thirty miles
north of the New Mexico line. Then
in regard to up in the air, we are up
some for we are 7540 feet above sea
level. You see we are even a mile
above vou neonlc. This is strictly an
irrigated country. The irrigating is
done by wells and a dam in the river
above us. There are many targe Mow
ing wells.
The main crops here are potatoes,
neas. barley, spring wheat and oats.
I have a very good church, 130 mem
bers, a nice cement block church, with
basement and Sunday School rooms.
Tims far our reception has been very
cordial and all seem to be doing their
best to make us feci at home.
I am feeling very much better tho I
am tiot entirely well. I do not have
the asthma here at all but the brouchal
tubes are soro yet and I get tired when
I preach twice and teach a Sinday
School class, I havo a due mens' class.
Tho children are both real well and
seem to like It here very much. Mrs.
Cole Is not feellug very well, she was
all tired out beiore suo came and then
I guess that the altitude Is nffecting
her a little, I think after she gets
tested aud a little used to the altitude
that she will bo all right.
We are praying for Red Cloud these
days aud are trusting that the Lord
will get hold of many of the hearts of
men there and lead them to accept
Christ as their personal Savior.
Please each one consider this a per
sonal letter and write to us.
Your friend and brother and family.
W. P. Cole.
