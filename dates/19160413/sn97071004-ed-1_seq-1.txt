large a force as 300,000. Senator
Chamberlain, chairman of the military
committee, originally proposed a peace
strength of 220,000.
During the week of discussion on
the bill there has been nothing to indi
cate the position of the,majority of
senators. It has been noticeable,
however, that there have been no pro
posals to reduce the committee's fig
ures. The bill passed Dy ine nouse

be sharply outlined.
Business Boom Reaches Retailers.
Chicago As spring approaches and
the period for more active outdoor
operations it at hand, the business sit
uation is being featured by an inten
sity of activity exceeding even that
of the boom months just past.
The effects of full employment and
rising wages are seen in the excellent
reports on the retail trade which come
from all sections of the country. There
is a large distribution of merchandise
and retailers, instead of buying for
immediate wants only, are endeavor
ing to stock up for some time to come.
This always is the case when the turn
has been completely made, and the
effect is to overwhelm jobbers and
wholesalers and stimulate prices
unduly.

Gold to Pay Off Soldiers.
El Paso General Ynez Salazar, one
of the best known of the former Hu-
etra generals, who has been living
here, was reported Sunday night to
have crossed the border with the an
nounced intention of taking up arms
against the United States.
The information was given to the
police by a man who was colsely as
sociated with Salazar and was ac
cepted by them as true, after investi
gation.
Torreon. Mex. Canuto Reyes, at
the head of a considerable number of
bandits, passed the Durango railroad
Sunday near Pedricena, going north,
It is supposed that his object is to join
Villa, who, according to latest reports,
is somewhere midway between Tor
reon and Parral.
A large number of bandits are re
ported by arrivals from the north to
be operating in the Sierra Mojada.
The Sierra Mojada is 120 miles north
of Torreon and an equal distance west
of Parral. It is one of the wildest ana
most desolate spots in Mexico. There
is a good deal of speculation here as to
the possibility that Villa and Canuto
Reyes are planning to concentrate
their forces in this sierra.
If they do, any troops coming from
the direction of Parral would have to
cross the terrible Mapinl desert, a
burning waste stretching 100 miles
north and south and from 50 to 60
miles broad. It is a spot that is dread
ed by Mexicans and shunned by fore
igners.
Columbus, N. M. American troops
in the field will soon be equipped with
new clothing to replace that torn into
shreds in the strain of the campaign.
A consignment of shoes, hats, uni
forms, sweaters and other wearing ap
parel, valued at $100,000, was for
warded south along the American line
of communication Sunday. With the
clothing went a shipment of approxi
mately a quarter of a million dollars
in Mexican gold and silver coin to be
used in paying the wages of the sol
diers.
Newly-Discovered Serum Is Used
Successfully in Drowning Cases
Baltimore, Md. Physicians at the
Johns Hopkins hospital invented some
time ago a device to restore to life
those apparently dead from drowning.
It proved successful on animals that
could be put under treatment immedi
ately after the accident.
With the idea of restoring life
some time after the accident, physi
cians began to search for a desired
serum.
However, in most of the cases there
have been after effects, such as high
blood pressure or hardening of the ar
teries. According to the physicians, if the
serum can be injected into the person
even several hours after the accident,
it will restore life. In one case on an
animal the serum was injected four
hours after "drowning," and the ani
mal was brought back to life, although
it died later from high blood pressure.
Three Killed in Auto Race.
Corona, Cal. Eddie O'Donell won
the third Corona boulevard race Satur
day in a "Roman holiday."
Bob Burman, of Detroit, the race
driver, his mechanician, Eric Schroed
er, of Chicago, and a guard, W. H.
Speer, of Corona, all were killed or
died soon after the race and five others
were injured when Burman's car
lurched off the track.
The list of dead and injured was
greater than the number of drivers
who crossed the finish line.
02 Saved From Steamer.
Malta, via London One engineer
and eight Lascars of the crew of the
steamer Chantala, were killed when
the vessel was sunk by a submarine.
Ninety-two survivors were rescued and
landed here. They declare they had
no warning of the impending attack.

AMERICAN CAVALRY AGAIN ROUT
VILLA BANDITS; THIRTY KILLED
San Geronimo, Chihuahua Via aero
plane to Colonia Dubian and by wire
less to Columbus, N. M. Two hundred
American cavalrymen under Colonel
W. C. Brown, Tenth cavalry, defeated
an equal force of Villistas in the sec
ond engagement of the campaign at
Aguas Calientea, 30 miles north of
Guerrero, on April 1.
This report was made to General
Pershing Wednesday by two Mexican
ranchmen, who said that the Mexican
forces lost 30 men and 40 horses, while
the Americans suffered no casualties.
Villa was not with the band, accord
ing to the ranchmen, who asserted
that the American troops believed at
first they had encountered the bandit
chieftain. An investigation showed
that he had not been with the detach
ment. For, hours the American cavalrymen
followed Manued Lopez, one of Villa's

lieutenants, and his bandits through
tortuous winding canyons and almost
impassable trails of the mountains.
Believing that they had eluded their
pursuers the bandits relaxed their vig
ilance and before they realized it they
were confronted by the troops of the
Tenth cavalry, General Pershing's old
regiment, which had been stationed
near the town to intercept stray bands
attempting to make their escape,
Only the most meager details of the
ensuing engagement were brought here
by the Mexican ranchmen, but in
many respects it resembled that of a
week ago at San Geronimo. Immedi
ately the bandits realized the presence
of American troops they began a hur
ried, disorganized flight from their
camp, some seizing their ponies and
others trying to make their escape
afoot. They went singly and in small
parties, all firing at the American
troops as they fled. None took aim,
the ranchmen said, and as a result
none of the bullets found a khaki-clad
mark

GERMAN DESPAIRS
Of FAVOR IN U. S.
Reichstag Leader Says Exporters
Bow to British Trade.
PEACE PROPOSALS STttL ACCEPTABLE
No Hope Entertained, However, of
Reply From Allies Must Fight
On for Their Fatherland.
Berlin, via London Following tho
speech of historical importance made
in the reichstag Friday by Chancellor
von Bethmann-Hollweg, Dr. Peter
Spahn, leader of the Center party, and
Friederich Ebert, leader of the Social
ists, endeavored to expand upon the
chancellor's declarations concerning
Begium and the relations between
Germany and the United States.
Dr. Spahn said America had shown
that her sympathies favored England.
Dr. Ebert said neutral rights must be
respected conscientiously and that un
restricted use of the torpedo must be
opposed "with the utmost sharpness."
Taking up the American question,
Dr. Spahn said:
"The press, people and the govern
ment of America have shown by their
conduct that their sympathies and bus
iness interests favor England and not
Germany. America has become a reg
ular arsenal and base of supplies on a
large scale for our enemies.
"The American government has
bound itself where we are concerned
to the formal letter of the law and has
employed regularly a more generous
interpretation of the regulations of
neutrality only in favor of the states
hostile to us. Much has been permit
ted there which, if done by as, would
have been used in America to provoke
an outbreak of hatred against us."
Dr. Spahn referred to the prolonged
negotiations with he United States in
regard to the submarine question, say
ing in that connection:
"Americans of German descent have
indeed endeavored to create a - senti
ment for our view, unfortunately with
out success. It is incomprehensible in
view of the sound business instinct of
Americans, that the interests con
cerned in legitimate export trade con
tinually bow to British encroachments
on maritime rights. The hopes placed
in the American congress in this re
gard have been disappointed."
Herr Ebert said he welcomed the
enunciation by the Chancellor of a
more definite peace program, but de
clared he had no expectation of any
response from the governments . at
London, Paris and Petrograd, although
it was evident the inclination for
peace was increasing among the peo
ples. "Therefore," he continued, "Ger
many must continue the war for de
fense of the fatherland, and the Social
ists, who, as representatives of the
working classes, would be chief suffer
ers from the project in the throttling
of German trade and industry, must
continue to support the government
resolutely."
Carranza Denies Giving U. S.
Permission to Use Railways
Queretaro, Mex. The Mexican gov
ernment has not given the American
government permission to use Mexican
railways for any purpose whatever,
said General Candido Aguilar, Mexican
minister of foreign relations, after a
meeting of the Carranza cabinet Sat
urday. At the cabinet meeting General Car
ranza and his ' advisers discussed the
modifications suggested by the United
States in the recent proposals for an
agreement for crossing the frontier
between the United States and Mexico
by armed forces of the respective gov
ernments. General Aguilar denied vigorously
stories published in the American press
to the effect that the Carranza govern
ment had given permission to the
United States army forces to use Mex
ican railways for transportation of
foodstuffs and supplies.
Indians Hold Potlatch,
Pendleton, Or. The old-time In
dians of the Umatilla reservation held
a potlatch Saturday. This is a custom
almost extinct and amounts to an ad
ministration of the personal estate of
a dead Indian. When a member of the
tribe dies without heirs it is customary
for the friends to gather and divide the
personal effects. This is made an oc
casion for feasting and various cere
monies are conducted, but these are
seldom held in modern days.
