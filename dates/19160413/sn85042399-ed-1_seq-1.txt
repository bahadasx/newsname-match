Soda-Lithia VeU ,
Ready For Pump
The soda-lithla, or Dodge, well has
been bored down to the original 131
foot level, the casing drawn and the
well made ready for the pump. En
gineer Phillips recommends that the
capacity of the pump be reduced to
approximately 25 gallons per minute
it now lifts about 38 gallons as
25 gallons he considers the safe
pumping capacity of the well. This
will bo accomplished by exchanging
the present six-inch cylinder for one
four and three-fourths Inches in di
ameter. Negotiations are now on for
the exchange, and as the pump manu
facturers are located In Now York
state it may be three or four weeks
before the new Installation Is com
pleted. The water appears all it was ex
pected to be good soda-llthla heavi
ily charged with gas. This water, the
commission thinks, will now be deliv
ered In the park In fine condition.
This should allay all doubt, if there
has been any, as to the successful de
livery of all the waters to the park in
the same condition as at the spring.
Reports have been received from
Corvallis on the lithia water, and it
Is found by analyses to be the same
at the fountain as at the spring.
The lithia and sulphur waters are
being now delivered In the park con
tinuously, and there should be no
serious intermissions in the future.
Medford baseball enthusiasts have
started spring practice and expect to
put a strong team In the field this
year. Ashland has much good base
ball material but owing to a lack of
a field where Sunday games may be
played, Will probably not have a
team.
Voters Turn Down
Refunding Deal
The voters of Ashland turned down
the proposition to rebond the city to
the extent of $43,500 by almost an
eleven to one majority at the special
election held Tuesday. But 402 votes
out of a possible 2,000 were cast.
Thirty-four votes favored the pro
posed deal and 368 voted against it.
The first ward stood 18 for and 108
against, the second ward went 9 for
and 118 against, and the third ward
10 for and 142 against.
The proposition was to rebond the
city, redeem outstanding bonds upon
which the city is paying 6 per cent
and turn the new bonds over to the
Lumberman's Trust Company of
Portland at 5 per cent Interest, thus
saving 1 per cent. The main objec
tion raised was that possibly by sub
mitting the proposition to the open
bond market a still better rate might
be obtained. Another objection was
to stringing the bonds out over ten
years or more when under the pres
ent system they would be paid off in
four. The public generally did not
take the trouble to Investigate the
matter thoroughly, hence the light
vote.

Must Reorganize
To Get on Ballot
The socialist party of the state
must reorganize to place a list of
candidates on the ballot for the next
election, according to an opinion
handed down by Attorney General
Drown In response to an Inquiry
from Secretary of State Olcott, says
the Capital Journal. Any political
party, under the state law, must poll
a vote of not less than 5 per cent of
the total vote cast for congressman In
the district. At the last election the
socialist party caBt more than 5 per
cent for congressman in the first dis-
trict, In the second district they had
no candidate, and in the third dis
trict polled loss than 5 per cent of
the total vote for congress. This
would prohibit the party from put
ting candidates in the field except as
a new party. The attorney general
says the socialists may reorganize
and as a new political party may nom
inate candidates by circulating peti
tions which contain the required per
cent of signers.
James Vance, who is home from
the University of Oregon to Bpend
the spring vacation at Medford, was
a visitor In Ashland Monday.

Would Give Medford
Kids Picnic Here
Medford Sun: An auto owner of
the city, who asks that his name be
deleted, has suggested that his fel
low auto owners set aside a couple
of Saturday afternoons during the
summer and donate the use of their
machines to take the children of the
city to Ashland, for a play In Lithia
Park. "Last Saturday," said the
bashful philanthropist, "I was going
down the street, and I counted over
100 idle machines. I thought then
what a fine idea it would be If boys
and girls who never see the inside of
a machine could be taken for a ride.
It wouldn't cost anybody much, and
would do the little folks a lot of
good." " . "

Wilson Murder
Trial April 20th

man, who shot and killed a Stockton
bartender several weeks ago in Stock
ton, California, will be tried on April

but was postponed until the twen
tieth. Wilson is held for murder without
bail. According to advices from
Stockton official opinion is that he
will be found guilty of manslaughter
but may be recommended to the
mercy of the court. The killing oc
curred under rather queer clrcum-
stances, Wilson having been ejected
from a saloon twice, returning with a
gun the third time and opening fire
on the bartender. Wilson afterward
stated that he remembered nothing
of the affair.
Wilson was at one time a member
of the Ashland police force but about
a year ago was dismissed following
a disgraceful attack upon Chief Por
ter. Wilson was a mining man and
has a wife and child. Some few
weeks previous to the Stockton kill
ing, he was employed as a guard at
the insane asylum at Stockton.

The popularity of the Rogue River
valley as an all-year resort is Bhown
by the purchase Tuesday of tho Emit
Britt property of 430 acres by Sir
Francis Webster, a wealthy flax

estate, where he expects to place his
rapped Mount Pitt and the Roguo
River valley.
Sir Francis Is said to be one of tho
