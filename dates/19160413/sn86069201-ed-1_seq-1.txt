ng out to give them welcome. Headed
by a brass band from the University of
Tennessee, they marched to the public
square, where Hon. G. II. Swiuebroad,
as President of tho LancasterCity Club
made a happy speech of welcome. He
was followed by JuJge II. II, Lindsey,
prominent lawyer of this southern
city and a former member of the Chan

duced other speakers, nil of whom were
loud in their praise at the welcome be
ing accorded them here. The other

MOTORIST FINALLY
CONQUERS HILL.
Over a four-block course, closely
guarded by 100 policemen, the famous
California Street Hill in San Francisco
was negotiated last week for the first
time, on high gear. This remarkable
feat which ha been attempted so many
times was accomplished by Geo. Har
rison in a Hudson Super-Six. equipped
with Goodrich Silvertown Tires. Most
cars can't make this steep, sheer, quar
ter-mile incline on low and very few
drivers attempt it in any gear. Mr.
Harrison says the speedy, even ten
aioned Silvertown aided him materially
LETTERS OF CON

I want to thank you for your thought-
fulness in sending me a copy of your
splendid paper under date of April the
Cth, asiuring you that it was not
sweetness lost on 'he desert air", but
enjoyed to the limit, which means, I
read it every word in relation to those
who have been its editor. I knew
them all, most of them intimately, and
as I take infinite delight in reveling in
reminiscence.i I very much enjoyed what
was said of and by the different men
whose gift are still discerned and moat
happily expressed. I recall the first
Issue of the Alpha quite vividly, and
let us hope that the Omega is far re
moved. So impressed wa I with this
particular publication that I concluded
before I had finished its reading that I
would join with the other five thousand
subscribers and assist in making thi
journal "a thing of beauty and a joy
forever." I, therefore, enclose my
check for the subscription price.

dation have come to us since our last
