Hats and Fixings.
If one possesses a good looking
tailor-made from last fall's outfit
it is quite possible to use it to ad
vantage, with smart new acces
sories that draw attention to
themselves and the werrer rath
er than to the costume. Care
and attention riven to the selec
tion of smart small belongings
are worth while for up-to-date
ness in minor points often counts
yery large in the sum total o
one's appearance.
New Bags.
"One smart shop here reports
sending a buyer on a flying trip
to Paris lately, just to secure the
last thing in bags, blouses and
neck fixings, and the way the
women surround these counters
in that particular place bears
witness to the worth-whileness
of their effort. ' Beaded bags are
first favorites for dress wear.
Some of them done in steel on
dark silk or leather, suit any time
of day, while others suggest the
vivid color creations of the fam
ous Russian ballet, which is a
gain entrancing the eye of the
metropolis. Nothing is too ele
gant or gorgeous to pose as a

bag, and no accessory adds more
in effectiveness, if well worn, or
relieves the sombreness or mon
otony of a costume more grate
fully, but ujed with a fussy back
ground such articles cease to be
smart or attractive.

ines. Collars have become capes or

tion, have assumed the hues of
rainbow, and added to them
selves vests in many instances.
Chm-Chin ruffs continue modish
and nearly meet the small turban
shapes with which type of hat
they usually go best. Spanish
influence is no doubt responsible
for the mantillas and pelerines
that have broken out in very del
uge of taffeta fabrics, in colors
so dainty and folds so volumin
ous that they are a joy to the
eye. For general wear these
garments are made up in black,
which goes with anything any
where, but for wear with fussy
frocks no color is too delicate,
and changeables are to the fore
again. Faille and satin are used
for long coats that coyer the cos
tume where a bit more warmth
is demanded and trimmings of
marabout are favorites with the.se.
Pagodas.
With the introduction of the
Chinese note in this season
fashions, pagoda suggestions are
prominent in hats and parasols,
The latter come in many ribbed
forms and are quite as apt to be
square as circular, and duplex
rather than single, as are many
of the hats with trimmings nes
tied under the overhanging part.
Chin straps and long ends of rib
bon or velvet or tulle hang from
the back of the hat or are dis
posed about the throat at the
whim of the wearer, and many of
these ends are ornamented with
small nosegays or other devices.
Spanish Combs and Fans.
To go with Spanish motifs in
dress design, huge combs adorn
the coiffure and the fan assumes
unusual importance. A fan of
white ostrich feathers held flat
against the frame has little tits
fluffing softly at intervals, the
ong wooden handle finished with
a small rosette in silk of vivid
color. Another has a handle of
yellow tortoise shell and natural
peacock feathers and is set with
brilliants. Tulle scarfs, just two
yards, cut off the piece unhem-
med, are worn by everyone in
the evening and fashion points to
the coming of the straight heeled
Spanish shoe.

Rheumsitlc Pain Stopped.
The drawing of muscles, the
soreness, stiffness and agonizing
pain of Rheumatism quickly yield
to Sloan's L'niment. It stimu-
ates circulation to the painful
part. Just apply as directed to
the sore spots. In a short time
the pain gives way to a tingling
sensation of comfort and warmth.

- On last Saturday morning we
beheld a scene resembling mid
winter so much that if we had
not known we were in the Apri
zone we would readily have con
eluded the lines had fallen to us
in January." The ground was
covered with several inches of
snow, the temperature pretty low,
the wind chilling and the snow
drifted to a considerable extent
This closed the outside shops and
work was suspended for the day.
Since then a more favorable as
pect has been enforced, but ov
ercoats and wraps have been in
large demand.
D. Moiil of Pleasant Hill was a
visitor here last Thursday night,
and attended Masonic lodge meet
ing.
On last Friday afternoon this
place enjoyed some rather unique,
not to say novel, entertainment.
A contest in Domestic Science by
the pupils in both the township
and village. The larger and the
smaller pupils, while it is no part
of the curriculum of the scnools,
yet it was undertaken to show
what children can do when tried
and for which a . premium was
paid for the best, and strange to
say, one little girl, aged about
seven years, took a first premium
on cake, and all did so well that
it was difficult to distribute the
honor td whom honor was due.
But this is the first experience in
this direction and we reasonably
expect some improvement in the
next attempt. A mistake was
made in not classifying the con
testants. As done, the small pu
pil had to contest with the larger,
an act without fairness. Let a
different rule prevail hereafter
and the tot will reap some con
sideration and fair treatment.
Our Christian Ladies' Aid of
the Beech church held a bazaar
and market here last Saturday
afternoon and feer quite elated
over the success they secured in
he sale of their products and the
iberal sam they realized, which
amounted to more than $50. They
will doubtless feel an inclination
;o duplicate their venture.
On next Saturday afternoon
and evening our M. E. ladies will
serve some sort of refreshments
and a good social time in the
basement of our M. E. church.
May they have the generous sup
port of our community. It is a
foregone conclusion "that they will
be equal to the occasion, and ren
der liberal support as surely will
be deserved.
Miss Lizzie Moul and Homer
Miller of Pleasant Hill were vis
itors here over Saturday and Sun
day among relatives and friends
The third quarterly conference
and meeting of this circuit will
be held at Horatio next Sunday
in an all-day meeting. , The su
perintendent of this district will
be present to conduct the servic
e3 in the administration of the
sacrament and the baptism of
persons desiring the rite.
- Easter is approaching, and it is
needf ul to begin taking thought
about it. It is on that day that
our M. E. Sunday school expects
to have an attendance of two
hundred, more rather than less
Some excellei.t music and inter
esting exercises will make the
occasion worth while. Let eve
rybody be there and show their
appreciation of the purpose to
have a large schod. ,
The Bishops of the M. E. church
have adopted a scheme where
with to increase missiorf funds by
prescribing self-deniajrom lux
uries for one week, and the mo
ney that would be so expended
diverted into the mission fund.
This, of course, applies .only to
members of that church, but sup
pose it does, and they all respond,
think of the vast fund it will
make. That week is' designated
as next week. This is an exper
iment, and suppose it should be
generally adopted, may it not be
said everybody would be the btt
ter for such abstinence? Let it
be tried and see results. This
may be done not only by 11. E.
people, but may be observed by
everybody! .

nation tests of seed oats from the
j,tates 0f Indiana, Iowa and Kan-
fa;r average of the seed that will
be sowed this spring, as the seed
came from farmers in response
to requests for samples of the
oats they are going to sow them-
3ilves.
The average germination was
lovvest for Indiana and highest
ForIowa Of the 2,900 samples
tested from the three states 268,
or over 9 per cent, germinated
less than 75 per cent ; 122 sam
ples, or over four per cent, ger
minated less than 50 per cent;
and 54 samples, or nearly 2 per
cent, germinated less than 25 per ,
cent. This shows that much of
the seed oats intended to be used
this spring germinates poorly and
that germination tests should be
made in all cases before sowing.
At the same time that the a
bove tests were -made 576 sam
ples taken from car lots of com
mercial oats were tested, the av
erage germination being 78 per
C3"t. This shows that where
commercial oats must be depend
ed on for a seed supply it is even
more important to test the seed
por germination than when local
supplies are relied on.
Seed showing a germina
tion should either not be sowed
or enough extra seed should be
used to insure getting a good
t
stand.
