Boiler Explosion Causes
Death and Destruction
Friday afternoon at one. o'clock
the boiler at the High Point Steam
Laundry blew up, killing Eli Ingram,
the negro fireman and painfully
wounding S. S. Martin, a white man
related to Crowder Brothers, pro
prietors of the laundry.
The explosion was due to the
,-arelesaess of the negro fireman in
mnnin cold water into its coils!
while too hot. The steam had run
so low on account of water that the
engine hardly moved the machinery
of the laundry and the proprietor
told the firemen about it but caution
ed him not to let cold water in un
til the boiler had cooled down some.
However in a few moments after
wards a terrific explosion took place
and the whole end of the laundry
was torn away. The boiler was
thrown around opposite to its ori
ginal position and landed 25 feet
north. Hundreds of brick and bits
of broken wood, bent and twisted
pipes covered the original location
of the boiler. The boiler had great
holes torn in its side and the front
end casings around the coils of
water pipes torn away like so much
cloth.
The heavy steam valve at the
top was broken and scarred as if a
tin toy instead of a huge piece of
iron. There it lay covered with
rust and dirt, hardly a solid place
on its thick covering of metal, with
its nose buried in the ground as if
in fright or ashamed of its behaviour,
ttie instrument which sent its ''mas
ter' of 10 year's service into eternity,
mangling the body of flesh and
blood right at the spot where once
stood this giant of iron and steel.
S. S. Martin was standing in the
door leading to the boiler room j
when the explosion occurred and
received severe burns about face
and hands from flying ash and
several wounds from &wiftly r
brick. He had a narrow escape from
death. The forct of the explosion
seems to have been diverted towards
safety, an open field. To the south
in vrv rcximitv was .the
Union SupplyXo's building but no
damage was done exept shattered
window panes due to the force of
the explosion. Had the boiler been
hurled in this direction no doubt
several emyloyes would have been
killed. And if the boiler had been
blown west towards the front of the
building or brick and other debis
diverted that way to any extent no
doubt several other lives would have
been sacrificed.
In fact it looks like "the fates"
were decidedly in favor of the living
a'id everything of a death dealing
nature turned towards an open field.
Messers. Crowder and Bros, should
"thank God and take courage" that
they came out so light. They were
about ready to move into their
building on East Washington street
anyway which is being done this
week and will be very little incon
vienced beyond what would have
been experienced in moving had the
accident never occurred.
Mr. Martin, who was wounded,
is getting along nicely. He lately
moved here and engaged in the
music business, operating a store
on North Main street.
The explosion shook things up in
general iherabouts. The fire de
partment responded to a call but
their services Jwere not needed as
there was little fire.
The New Cafe
The editor visited the new cafe
of Brown and Wagner Tuesday and
found everything in first-class shape
and a close inspection classes this
cafe beyond the 97 per cent mark,
a close Tun to a perfect standard.
If those gentlemen keep up the high
standard set and there is reasons to
believe they will, a fine patronage
should be theirs.

Mr. Dalton's Candidacy
The Greensboro News in speak
ing of Carter Dalton's candidacy
fer the House, says among other
things that "there has been express
ed in Greensboro in the close-up
circles the willingness to let High
Point select her man and it is un
derstood that Mr. Dalton has receiv
ed many strong pledges xof support
in High Point". In fact it already
looks like Mr. Dalton is an easy
winner if the plan is to be carried
out to let High Point have who she
wants as one of the representatives
Mr. Dalton's card appears as an ad
vertisement elsewhere. Read it.
Young John Farlowe has joined
the Hopewell colony.
Safeguard the Public's
Health
We repeat that it is due the citi
zens of High Point to have the milk
supply analyzed monthly just like
it was being done in a way some
time ago. Every other town thinks
enough of the health of its people
to have this done and High Point cer
tainly deserves no less. It will do
no harm to present the figures in
black and white and will be an in
centive to those selling milk in High
Point to furnish the best quality
possible, free from injurious or
death dealing microbes, it matters
not whether he be democrat or re
publican, Methodist or Baptist or
what not? We want the best safe
guards thrown around our people
and we must have it. Will the
proper authorities act on the matter?
The same way in regard to the
restaurants,.' the people are entitled
to the best, wholesome food cooked
iu sanitary kitchens and an in
spection will tell the tale. Let us
do our duty in these matters.

ing $13. a piece. Entrance wai ef
fected from a window on Commerce

was an easy matter for the robbers
to get all the Ford tires in sight.
