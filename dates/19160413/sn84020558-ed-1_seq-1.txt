Th investigation covering the Sussex
c.tse, says the note, was extended to
all actions, undertaken on March 24
the day of the Sussex incident in the
Channel between Folkestone ana
Dieppe, l ine steamer was sunk, the
commander of the German submarine
reaching the definite conclusion that
it was a war vessel. A sketch of this
vessel, together with photographic
reproductions of a picture of the Sus
sex, printed in the London Daily
Graphic, were enclosed with the note,
the difference in tl'.e two craft being
indicated.
The steamers Englishman and Eagle
Point were sunk by German submar
ines after they had attempted to es
cape and time was allowed for the
withdrawal of those aboard.
The steamer Berwindvale was pos
sibly sunk by a German submarine,
which definite details with respect to
the Manchester Engineer are lacking
and therefore there has been no suf
ficient basis for investigation of this
particular case.

PARIS, April Pi. Fragments of the
missile which damaged the cross
channel steamer Sussex which have
been handed the American naval at

Saturday. The pouch will not reach
Washington before April Ti.
A report indicating the character of

the ocular evidence furnished by the
actual fragments is considered of

WASHINGTON, April 12. Admis
sion by Germany that her submarines
recently attacked three merchant ships
carrying American citizens and that
one of them torpedoed a vessel in the
vicinity of the point where the steamer
Sussex was damaged by an explosion,

the work of the punitive expedition
in Mexico is accomplished within a
very few days, means will be sought
to strengthen General Pershing's
forces at the front, it was author
itatively stated tonight. It is ex
pected that General Funsotn will ask
the war department to move into the
southern department the 4,000 troops
that are stationed at other points in
the Vnited States. If this is done,
these will be placed on duty along
the border, and patrol duty on the
frontier. If the war department re
gards the transfer of troops not now
in the department as inexpedient, it
is believed that General Funston will
recommend using the militia to re
lieve the troops along the border.
Whether the somewhat vague un
derstanding entered into between
American officers and Carranza au
thorities for the movement of sup
plies consigned as ordinary freight,
is a success which is considered
doubtful in some quarters but by
headquarters officials it was deemed
worthy of trial. ,
If higher officials in Mexico do not
interfere with the arrangement, it
was recognized that it will go far
towards alleviating a situation that
quartermasters- officials had regarded
as rapidly becoming acute, but since
the request for the use of the rail
roads was asked the military situa
tion has so changed, military men
declare that even greater use of the
railroads must be had if the cam
paign against the bandit chief and
his thousands of followers is car
ried to a logical finish.
