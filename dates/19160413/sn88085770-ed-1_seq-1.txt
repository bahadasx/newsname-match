The recent meeting of the Prussian

of I HcUSSJOn on the industrial and
commercial situation of Germany.

"Consider that well," and regard my
words as the warning of,, a mailwhoi
j has already frequently \>i?i\u associat
ed with the conduct of great economic
battles waged in Germany, and who
can therefore estimate what such a
fight would mean after the war."
With regard to the present econom
ic position, Herr Hue stated that quite
a considerable section of the so-called
middle class had lost their independ
ence entirely, or as good m entirely,
in consequence of the war, and that
numbers of these people had gone to
swell the ranks of the proletariat.
Thus numbers of small tradesmen, and
so forth, -together with their wives
and daughters, were now working in'
the factories, and the number of people
seeking work had risen enormously. In
1915 the number of women who ap
plied for posts exceeded the number
of vacancies by about 400,000. and
v the same thing occurred with regard
to private situations. Unemployment
was greatest in the textile industry,
where, in accordance with the federal
council's orders, the factories were
working only five days a week, and in
some places— in the Lower Rhine dis
trict, for instance—only two or three
days a week. Herr Hue urged that
the relief granted by the state should
be increased, and insisted that wages
as a whole must be increased, or the
price of food lowered, for as matters
were there was "no denying that the
greater part of the nation" was "suf
fering great privations."
Complains of Inadequate Pay
The Socialist spokesman complained,
in this connection, that disabled men
discharged from the army were not
being • adequately paid by their em
- ployers, not e\'en those working in
the government printing works, and
that coal and leather merchants were
making enormous profits.
WHO CREATES DEMAND?
(By F. V. McMurry)
A popular delusion that has been
inoculated into some people's "seat of
reason" by those who do their think
ing for them, is that old and over
worked notion that the capitalist ere- |
ates a demand for commodities.
In the first place, what is a commod
ity? "It is something that satisfies
some human want; something pro
duced by labor-power for sale or ex
change." '
To take issue with the argument
that a capitalist creates demand, or
anything else of value, let us analyze
"demand." In the sense in which we
are using the word demand, the dic
tionary defines it: "To require as nec
essary or useful."
In the light of the above definitions,
is it possible that one who creates
nothing of intrinsic value, can create
demand for those commodities that
man requires to satisfy human wants?
It is not the capitalist who creates
demand, but rather, it is the demand
that creates the capitalist. The de
mand (human needs) creates an in
centive, under the prevailing economic
order, for one person to control the
things that physical necessities re
quire. The people create the demand;
Labor supplies the demand, and Para
sites (capitalists) own the source of
supply. They own the supply after
it has been created by labor from nat
ural resources, and they withhold the
supply from those whose necessities
created the demand, until the produc
ers of the supply pay to the non-pro
ducers its cost of production.
Thus we see that the sole function
of a capitalist is to live as a vampire
from unearned increment or profit. A
capitalist is merely a parasite on so
ciety.

WHAT WE CAN PRACTICE
FORM Oil! THOUGHTS INTO ACTIONS
By MARVIN SANFORD
Libert) is not something that is I
be taken. It feeds on
Bom of oppression, the »le-1
sire for liberty intelligently expresses
in a militant industrial and pol
itical movement for the freeing of the
people from the bondage of private
control of social necessities. Our mis
sion as socialists is no less than the
achievement of human liberty by plac
ing the people's Bocial control the soc
[ially operated tools of production.
This is the Revolution. It is the cul
mination of a long Btruggle which re
quires men and women of caliber for
its triumph; needs ballots with intelli
gence and power In hind them. „
Putting into operation the economic
theory of Socialism while living under .
an anti-social, capitalistic system, is,
of course, impossible. That is, you
cannot "practice Socialism under Cap
itaiism," as our ffeiiuis' the <-h- ,:■;"•
sometimes demands.
These facts a «• well known to Soc
ialists, but the purpose of this article
is to impress upon the socialist the
fact that there are in a sense certain
things which he professes to believe
that he can practice, and furthermore
that this is necessary to the triumph
of the Revolution and the liberation of
labor.
For instance, you as a socialist, will
admit that Man No. 1 shouldn't have
to do .Man No. 2's work. Suppose
Man No. 1 to be L. (Labor), No. '2. to
be the C. (Capitalist Master). Hut so
long as Brother C owns the things that
Brother L must use in order to sustain
life, and so lony as the party of the
first part controls the armies ai^l nav
ies and colleges and newspapers and
laws of the world to back him up in
the said ownershipjust so long must
Brother Ldo brother D's work. Par
ty 1 and party 2 then form the con
testants in the world class war, which
will be ended only by the equalization
of the opportunities for productive
work and its rewards. In the mean
time, the realization of that aim calls
for education and organization of the
world's workers to deal with the prob
lem- Now arises the question! is a
Socialist consistent if he says, "Let
George do it." and take no active part
in the necessary work that lies be
tween v and our liberty?
People Diin't Know
Actually there are hundreds of In
telligent people in this year of Our
Lord WIG who don't know or realize
that we are in the midst of a revolu
tion a contest of combatting forces
arrayed against each other, the issue
of which is to decide whether we are I
to K<> forward into the time of liberty
and cla lea society, or backward into
the dark ages and the wreck and
di olution of civilization and social
order. They don't see Ihe band of
workers on the one hand battling for
the life of their class and its frei
and 'hi the other hand the masters of
ur lives working only to root, out from
the people all ideas (if freedom, work
ing as the agent of plundering inter
ests, working as a thief of the rights
of men am! women to labor and to live
and let live.
Now the Mile lion is, in the fact of
this awful struggle, are we going to
lie down on tlie job or merely jabber

to get down to REAL WORK on the
most inspiring job eve; given to man

The Socialist movement is an edu

carry on an effective propaganda, i
Therefore every man or woman who
writes Socialist after his or her name ,
should belong to the party organiza
tion and see thai your face is at the
meeting regularly your coin in the

Our next duty is to support our '
press. Without a powerful, virile, un
compromising working class press we
cannot make progress worthy of our
tause—cannot fulfill our mission as a
revolutionary political party- Patron
izing our advertisers, getting subscrip- i
tions—these are things that you can ;
do, and every little bit helps. Thought- |
. lussness. is a _K"od habit to «et ov-er,
and remember there is a "land where
I the streets are paved with the things |
we mean to have achieved."
Wanted—one Word- Something to
ay that will make you realize the
importance of the last few lines writ- i
'in above the importance of patron
izing our advertisers, the easiest of |
methods to support and build up an
effective avenue of publicity to reach ,
the necessary workers.
To build system out of chaos is the
work of nature; can we do belter than ;
to 'ake nature's suggestion?
Can Practice Teachings
It would appear, then, that we can
practice some of the things we preach. ■
We can practice SOLIDARITY! With- '
out Solidarity, Unity, Singleness of '
Purpose, thought formed into action,
our discontent will avail us nothing. '
We can practice principle building. '
We can insist inside and outside the
organization that the working class
land for the organized control of the
industrial and political world.
We can center our force upon our
enemy and not upon the members of '
our own class.
We can -land united for the enforce
ment of our method for Socialism is
but a method, rational and sane, <>i
social organization; Capitalism an
other, iinralional and insane. The
benefits will be ours; "the sacrifice
necessary to win it, ought therefore
to be ours." It must be ours, for no
oppressing class gives up to the op
pre ted; liberty is not given, but
taken.
In closing let me reiterate: The
power of Solidarity is supreme. We
inu ! unite, unfaltering and iii invin
cible numbers, circulating the press of
our class, breeding class conscious
ness where we may go; fighting for
the reign of reason, until the working
cla , energetic and strong, class con
i cious and bound by common ties, their
hearts fired by our indomitable will
and spirit, enter upon their mission of
the conquest of the world.

inn: I not fighi merely in the trenches,
but should lower their arms and di
rect them against the common en
emy," was the declaration of Dr. Karl
Liebknecht that aroused the turbu
lent scene in the Reichstag Thursday.
The Socialist's speech was several
times interrupted, and finally the
president forbade him to go W1 with it.
The session ended in turmoil.
In denouncing the demorili/.ing ef
fects of the war, Dr. Liebknecht spoke
as follows:
"Education today serves to strength
en militarism and capitalism. You act
I If you wish to throw open to the
people the road to education, but that
is only because capitalism requires
soldiers. The teaching of history is
systematically distorted for the pur
pose of introducing certain political
convictions into the schools and also
hatred against England. The militar
izing of schools converts them into
training stables for war. You edu
cate your children to be war machines.
With regard to war, their ideals seem
to be embodied in poison gas bombs.
In the schools should be taught not
only that the murder of Archduke
Franz Ferdinand, of Austria, at Sara
jevo, was an incident which should in
spire horror, but it should also be
taught that there were wide circles
in Germany and Austria in which this
murder was regarded as a veritable
Godsend."
PATCHED CAPITALIST SIEVES
WILL NEVER HOLD THE WATERS
OF ECONOMIC JUSTICE
Within the Socialist party there I
have always been two divergent views;
! the one holding that it is the function
of the party not to aim at reform, but
to conduct an active, propaganda for
the complete overthrow of the cap
italist system, and emphasizing this
attitude even when at times actively
supporting palliative measures; the
other laying especial emphasis on
the humanitarian features of the or
ganization, content with merely vague
allusions to the class war, but in
tensely intent on bringing about the
millenium by the route of reform—
mother's pensions, old age pensions,
unemployment insurance, accident in
surance, and so forth, with here and
there a little sop for the farmer.
It seems to the writer that it
largely depends on which of these be
liefs a person leans as with what sig
nificance the introduction of London's
unemployment insurance bill will be
regarded.
Personally, the writer is not of the
belief that it is a radical bill at all,
•onsidered from the viewpoint of labor.
True, if it is carried out in its widest
measure, it will relieve the unem
ployed situation at a time that it
needs relieving but in all serious
ness, is such a step calculated to ob
tain economic justice? Is it a measure
that will tend to relieve permanently
the unemployed situation, or is it not
one of those palliative measures which
simply tends to smooth off the rough
spots from capitalist exploitation, pour
oil on the healings, as it were?
It is the writer's belief that the So
cialist attitude should be unfaltering
ly uncompromising as to the indus
trial situation. To attempt to solve
the unemployment by governmental
means is to hold, in a measure, th>it
the government and not industry is

Comrade Herman, the new State

the Comrades of Everett can give him
in the office will be very much appre

It has been the custom to pay all
help in the office but owing to the
number of bills to be met and the
starting of the campaign, it will be im
possible to pay comrades for their as
sistance from now on. So, if you have
any -spare time on your hands during

good work along, it will be much ap
preciated, fall up Comrade Herman,

At these words a wild uproar arose
in the House, the President vigorously
ringing his bell. Dr. Liebknecht
shouted: "It is the truth! It is the
whole truth!" The President there
upon culled him to order, and the ma
jority of the members left the Cham
ber.
Dr. Liebqnecht went on: "Just as
in the Thirty Years' War, so the pres
ent war has a demoralizing and bane
ful effect, on education. As long as
our educational ideal centers in a
death struggle the liberation of the
working classes cannot come."
The President for the second time
called the speaker to order, but he con
tinued: "The workers themselves must
tackle the job of education. The troops
must not fight merely in the trenches;
they ought to lower their arms and di
rect them against the common en
emy."
The President again rang his bell.
Dr. Liebknecht tried to continue, but
the President kept on ringing, and
said, addresing the members: "I beg
that all those present who still wish
to hear Dr. Liebknecht will stand up."
As only Socialists stood up, Dr. Lieb
knecht was forbidden to speak fur
ther, the majority present loudly ap
plauding this decision. Dr. Liebknecht,
however, continued in his efforts to
speak, but could not make himself
heard, owing to the terrific commo
tion. As he was leaving the rostrum,
there were loud shouts of "Out with
him!"
responsible for the situation. It is
all too evident that such is not the
truth. Industry alone is responsible
and industry should be made respon
sible for the unemployed; should be
made to look after them, not only six
months in the year, but twelve months
in the year, year in and year out.
Saddle the responsibility where it be
longs. Force the capitalist system to
provide for the working class.
Neither is it intended that the cap
italist class should feed them by char
ity. That is the attitude it usually
takes, but the Socialist movement
should unalterably be opposed to that
also. Charity should have no part in
>ur program, and, to the writer's mind,
unemployed insurance is merely a
form of charity, a Salvation army
woodpile on a larger scale.
One will recall that the Romans
tried charity on an elaborate scale.
Shipload after shipload of corn was
distributed to hold in peace the men
acing' proletarians. Oppression and
charity have always gone hand in
hand, and no greater safeguard could
be invented for perpetuating the capi
talist class ad infinitum than by plac
ing on the government the responsi
bility of looking after the working
class in times when the capitalists
have need of their labor. It isn't nec
essary for the Socialists to oppose
such a movement, because the capital
ists will soon enough inaugurate any
such measure as quick as the working
class becomes menacing—and not be
fore—and that to protect their own
pelf. But it does seem that Socialist
representatives in Congress can do far
more by simply exposing the follies of
the capitalist system of society than
by attempting to remedy existing con
ditions by palliative measures.

SOCIALIST
VICTORIES
MILWAUKEE IS
AGAIN FAMOUS
Comrade D. W. Hoan was elected
Mayor of Milwaukee by 33,863 votes.
His majority over Bading, the late
"non-partisan" mayor, was 3,157.
Hoan carried 15 out of 25 wards.
Emil Seidel, the Socialist who was
elected mayor in 1912, received 27,608
votes at that time, and in 1912 when
he ran for re-election and was defeat
ed by a non-partisan, he received
30,200. The present vote for Comrade
Hoan shows a steady increase in So
cialist voters.
Eleven Socialists were elected to the
council and 26 non-partisans. This is
a gain of two for the Socialist minor
ity, and it will give them the upper
hand in many cases.
Emil Seidel was elected alderman
at-large and it is expected that he will
be the floor leader for the minority.
CHICAGO MAKES BIG GAIN
Comrade W. E. Rodriguez was re
elected alderman in Chicago by a land
slide. He received 8,067 votes to 4,
--028 for the republican and 2,130 for
the democrat. Close runs were made
by the Socialists in other wards.
The total vote cast for the Social
ists numbered 47,779 as against 24,
--452 one year ago. This is a gain of
85 per cent. The Socialists still have
two on the council, as Comrade Ken
nedy holds over for another year.
ABERDEEN, WASH.
We have heard (through the medi
um of the capitalist press) that one
Socialist alderman was re-elected.
How about this, Aberdeen ?
ANOTHER MAYOR
David Love, Socialist, was elected
mayor of West Allis, Wis. J. Boloun
and Vern Rogers, Socialists, were
elected aldermen in the first and
fourth wards.
TREBLE SOCIALIST VOTE
WEWOKA, Okla.—The Socialists
of Seminole county trebled their vote
in the last two years. The red card
membership was 106 two years ago,
now it is 306. Local Socialists predict
that this year's vote will show the
same increase. *
ASS IN A LION'S SKIN
In Australia the Labor Party holds
complete control of the reins of gov
ernment. It has used its power in var
ious ways calculated to relieve the
workers from the terrible economic
pressure of capital. It has thrown a
customs barrier around a "White Aus
tralia." By state regulations of wages
it has attempted to knock out the "iron
law of wages. "Old age pensions have
been provided, preference given to
members of unions and courts have
been set up to settle industrial dis
putes. Various other attempts have
been made to adjust the relationship
between Labor and Capital. Today
no one dares speak of the "rights of
Labor." Many have been jailed by
the "Labor administration" for so do
ing. The war has taken precedence
over the "unity of Labor." The wage
workers of Australia .dare not call
their bodies or souls their own. They
are as completely as ever denied the
right to remain in employment, ex
cept by the wish of their masters. In
spite of state regulation their labor
power must be offered cheap or it
cannot be sold. The "iron law of
wages" has not been put out of bus
iness. All of which should point out
to us that "Labor Parties" born of an
ignorance of the class character of
modern society and of the irreppres
sible conflict of interest between Labor
and Capital, are bound to prove a de
lusion and a snare. This attempt to
while leaving the property rights of
their masters intact must fail. The
lighten the burden upon the workers
class war must be fought out upon
the property rights of the capitalist
class. Any "Labor Party" that at
tempts to reconcile the conflicting in
terests of Labor and Capital and plays
for the patronage and plaudits of the
enemies of Labor is a veritable ass in
a lion's skin. At least that is the most
charitable inference to be drawn that
will not seriously reflect upon the in
tegrity of its leaders, British Colum
bia Federationist.
