SEATTLE'S MAYOR
WOULD HAVE CITY
IE
Would Have Cities of
First
Class Permitted'to Handle
All Booze
BLIND PIGGERS WOULD
BE PUT OUT OF BUSINESS
Fake Drug Stores Would Also
Be Compelled to Close
Their Doors
Seattle. Wash., April 1.1. Hi Gill,
mayor of Seattle, the largest dry city iu
the country today proposed, iu a re
markable iuterview, that the city of Se
attle go into the saloon business.
The mayor offers this utartling sug
gestion as the only effective means of
eliminating the illicit sale of liquor by
drug 9tores.
"I suggest.v he said, "that the imxt
session of the legislature bo asked to
enact a law permitting cities or thi
first class to take cnarge of the sah
of whiskey by physicians' prescriptions.
Druggists should be lorbidden to sell i
at nil. The city should establish sta
tions at widely distributed points in the
city sufficient to accommodute all
emergency needs."
Such a law, the mayor declares' would
quickly put out of business drug stores
which have sprung up for the solg pur
pose of harvesting a fat profit off
whiskey drinkers.
Persons who want liquor would be
compelled to get it by the method pro
vided in the prohibition law, through
permits issued by the county auditor.
And the worst of the blind pigging
would bp- wiped out, t least, o far as
Seattle is concerned.
Mayor Gill has given the prohibition
enforcement problem considerable
study,
Attorney Indorses Idea.
Prosecuting Attorney Alfred i.undin
today gave the mayor's idea his eui-
iihatic endorsement. He said he necs
no reason why it cannot bo carried
through.
It is possible that the state republi
can convention, to be held at North
Yakima on May (I may be asked to
adopt resolutions favoring such a law
as the mavor advocates.
"There ui'e a lot of shyster doctors,"
Gill declared, "who will soil a whiskey
prescription to anyone. As long as Se
attle is afflicted with those fellows.
and with professional blind piggers,
we are going to have trouble enforcing
the law."
The mayor told of the frequent in
quint's he received for information as
to how the prohibition law is working
out in this city and state.
"I tell these people," he said, "that
what I enn see with niv own eyes that
prohibition lias been a wonderful thing
for Seattle. I know men who now keep
their families clothed and their grocery
bills paid who, in the days of the saloon,
never hud a nickel. I know that times
are better. I've seen enough to know
that I am now a 'dry' dry as and
I'm going to stay a 'dry.'
"There mnv be some soaks who still
go into the back room of drug Htorrs
I and guzzle booze, but your boy, and my
i boy, nren't doing it. There nrenfit any
I saloons for them to walk into. And if
I I have my way there aren't going to be
any saloon-drug slores either."

it was a war vessel.

Compiling Evidence.
By Robert J. Beuder.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, April Li The tables nre
clear for a "show down" on the sub
marine issue. Today the administration
is completing evidence tending to prove
Germany guilty of repeatedly violating
its assurances with regard to conduct
of the undersea campaign.
"The government will act now in a
mftnnor entirely satisfactory to the peo
ple," declared an intimate friend of
President Wilson today.
The fact that Germany admits at
tacking a vessel near where the channel
steamer Su.isex was damaged by an ex
plosion strengthens the administration's
position, it is held, ven though t It
kaiser said the ship his war craft tor
pedoed wus apparently not the Sussex.
The Ilerlin claim claim that Germany
never promised to trent freight steam
ers the same as liners is a large fuctor
iu the discussion. Secretary I.nnsing
believe that Germany could not legally
decline to include freighters in its ns
surnneos with regard to liners.

Washington, April 1.1. In advance of
actual receipt of Provisional President
Venustiano Carranza's note demanding
withdrawal of Amoricnn troops from
Mexico, and before tho administration's
policy had been formulated, a high gov
ernment official hinted broadly to the
United Press todny that It was doubt
ful if this country would meet the
demands.
Secretary Lansing snid he had not re
ceived tho Mexican note, and declined
to divulgo what his policy toward it
would bo.
Mexican Ambassador Arredondo de
clined to discuss the note. The Mexican
emlmsxy was said to bo translating the,
official text of the message. When this
is accomplished it will be takeu im
mediately to the state department.
Tho note was characterized rather as
a "request," asking for negotiations
looking toward withdrawal of Ameri
can troops, giving constitutionalists a
freo hand to contiiie the Villa chase.
Hccretnry Aguilar's note was deliver
ed to Ambassador Arrododo at 3 a. ru.
today. It is still being translatod, al
though the embassy is uncertain wheth
er to givo to Secretary Lansing in Kiig
lisli or in Spanish us it wu-s received.
Arredondo refused to discuss tho com
munication before delivering it to Lan
sing. Keeps President Home.
President Wilson lias cancelled his
proposed trip to New York next Sutur
day for tho purpose of addressing tho
Young Men's Democratic league.
The note relates that Lansing ex
pressed extreme regret at the situation
and Hint Ciirranza finally agreed troops
already in Mexico might remuin pend
ing completion of another agreement by
which the "first chief" was to give
them permission to operate in his coun
try. It iigaiu specified that the pro
posal Car rn ii7.ii made after tho Colum
bus raid did not give the permission
the United States requested.
America, said the note, assured Car
ranza tho expedition would confine its
operations to the solo object of appre
hending Villa. Carianzii now consid
ers that object tier niiiplishcd, therefore,
Mexico will not complete the proposed
second agreement for further opera
tions. Tho message reminds tho United
Slates further than the expedition hns
no b'L'iil standing and that the time lia
conic to consider its withdrawal.
