View on Border Is That the
Bandit Chief Is Hidden
in Sierra Madres
SOLDIERS BEING
LURED SOUTHWARD
Little Stock Taken in the
Reported Death offthe
Leader of Rebels
El Paso, Tex., April 12. —Masking
his trail with the deluding Action
spread broadcast by Mexican peons
that he is dead of his wounds, Fran
cisco Villa is thought by Mexican mil
itary officers in Juarez to be safely hid
den away In the sheltering recesses of
the Sierra Madre mountains while the
American cavalry is pursuing a rear
guard band of Villa .bandits, whose
strategy Is to beguile Villa's pursuers
away from the hiding place of their
chief.
Mexican followers of Villa In other
campaigns say it was a favorite trick
of Villa whefi the chase became hot for
the bandit to have the story spread
that he was dead, that the ardor of his
pursuers might be dampened.
Brig. Gen. Pershing has established
a new base at Satevo, according to in
formation here, but no word has come
from the flying columns of American
cavalry under the command of Cols.
Dodd and Brown whose pursuit of the
Villa forces is said to extend beyond
Parral.
There Is nothing official to confirm a
report that American troops killed a
number of Villa bandits last Saturday
south of Satevo.
z*:? Supplies in increasing quantities are
being steadily forwarded by the quar
termaster's department to Casas Gran
des, JNTamlquipa and other points.
VICTIMS'OF VILLA.
Pershing's Camp, at the Front,
April 10.—(via aeroplane to Columbus,
N. M., April 12)—Two widows of Car
ranza'officers slain by Villa near here
passed through camp today enroute to
Chihuahua. One was Senora Innocente
aged 16, and the other Senora Tomas
Milan, aged 20.
"I wished to kill Villa myself," said
Senora Riviera, "so they are sending
me away from this part of the
country."
Senora Riviera had been married
three months when her husband was
killed, when some of Villa's forces
rushed the Guerrero garrison at 3
o'clock on Monday morning, March
28. The 16 year old bride was in
Minaca at a dance that night, while
her husband, a colonel, was on duty
in Guerrero.
The other young woman, Senora
Milan, had been to San Ysidro to a
Sunday night dance from which she
was returning accompanied by her
husband, a lieutenant colonel, when
some of Villa's men came upon them.
Senora Milan was short, her husband
tall. A Villa officer levelled his rifle
directly over her head, as she sought
to protect her husband and shot him
dead.
The two young women said that
Villa sent detachments to attack not
only Guerrero but San Ysidro and
Minaca, all of which are near, the
same night. At San Ysidro, s* Villlsta
.soldier disguised as' a torilla seller, en
r, tered town two days before, the at
tack, acting as a spy on all the garri
son's plans. Similar spies preceded
Villa into Minaca and Guerrero.
:Neither of the young women knew of
the wounding of Villa.
VILLA NOT DEAD.
El Paso Tex., April 12.—An entirely
new version of the story of Villa's
death was brought here today by a
Mexican cattleman, who claimed to
have suffered a visitation from a band
of Villistas on his ranch near Bachi
niba. This man said that Villa was
neither dead nor wounded but that
Pablo Lopez, the bandit's notorious
lieutenant and executioner In chief,
had died and that Villa had deliber
ately used his death as the basis of
the story of his own finish.
The Mexican who told this story Is
well known to several Americans here
who considered him reliable.
Villa's ride south has been a dis
astrous one for the villages and the
small towns through which he has
raided, according to numerous reports
received here. His men have looted
at will and have been ruthless in their
destruction of property. Several re
ports relate instances of women being
outraged and of Mexicans who were
shot because of their supposed friend
liness to Americans, but none of them
have been corroborated.
The most reliable information now
is that the bandit is in northern Du
rango, trying to arrange for a concen
tration for the Villistas who have been
operating under Canuto Reyes.

IN FIERCE FIGHT
GARRISON AT PA3AJE, DURANQO,
ENQAQES BAND3 OF THE ENE
MY FOR FIVE H0UR8.
Torreon, via El Paso Junction,
April 12.—Details of a five hour battle
between tne Carranza garrison at
Pasaje, Durango, and an attacking
force composed of Contreras and Ceni
ceros bandits were brought here todaiy.
The outlaws lied in disorder into the
hills of the Nazas district after losing
seventy killed, it is reported. The de
facto troops had four dead.
The battle took place on Sunday.
First reports were that, the attacking
force was commanded by Gen. Canuto
Reyes.
As negotiations have been under
way for the surrender of Gen. Reyes
under an amnesty grant, bitter disap
pointment was expressed by Carranza
officials. The surrender of Reyes was
expected to seriously cripple the Villa
cause in the neighborhood of Torreon
and Durango.
The fight was reported to have been
precipitated by the garrison, which
was said to have fired on the troops
of Gen. Reyes as they approached un
der an agreement for peace negotia-,
tlon. The latest details, however,
seem to show that Reyes is not impli
cated and there are still hopes that
he will cease warfare against Gen.
Carranza.
A doctor sent from here to treat
some of the men wounded in the batle
said that the Contreras and Ceniceros
attackers were subjected to withering
Are from the garrison. They fled in
disorder. He arrived in time to count
the bodies of seventy of the outlaws
scattered over the battle ground.
Among the dead were a colonel and a
captain.
After the battle word was brought In
that Juan Lamadrid, a noted bandit,
was killed in a dispute over the divi
sion of loot by the Contreras bandits.
ORDNANCE FORCE INCREASED.
Columbus, N. M., April 12.—Prepa
rations to increase the ordnance de
partment at the expeditionary base
here were being made today. Ten
men are expected from the govern
ment arsenal at Rock Island, 111., to
augment the present force, which un
der the supervision of Lieut Clarence
S. Danielson of Lead, S. D., has issued
pieces to troops in the field since the
beginning of the campaign.
The six wounded Villista prisoners
brought here last night were being
held in the hospital today under heavy
guard. It Is assumed that they will
be taken to Deming to await trial.
USING THE RAILROAD.
Washington, D. C., April 12. —Re
ports of a battle between troopers of
the seventh cavalry and Villa bandits
south of Namiquipa were not mention
ed in the war department's early dis
patches today and there was no fur
ther mention of the reported death of
Villa.
Maj. Gen. Funston reported the prog
ress of a new plan for sending supplies
forward to Brig. Gen. Pershing's col
umns. A trial shipment of nine car
loads forage has been sent over the
Mexican Central line, which has the
most direct route to Chihuahua, where
it probably will be transferred to the
Mexican Northwestern and sent on
south.
Maj. Gen. Scott said today that
Mexicandirect use of the Mexican Cen
tral, in that way, instead of shipping
through mining companies or brokers,
would greatly simplify supplying the
troops in the field.

Gallant Germans Die Trying

Around Verdun
FRENCH MANAGE
TO WITHSTAND FOE
Reports From the Eastern
Fields Fail to Show
Material Changes
Paris, April 12.—While bringing up
reinforcements to resume their at
tack on Le Mort Homme, the Hill of
the Dead Man, the Germans are try
ing to recover the ground regained by
the French in Caillette wood, and to
the north between Douaumont and
Vaux.
The French positions there des
cribe an arc from a point south of
Doiiaumont fort to the center of the
village of Vaux and the front is a lit
tle less than two miles in length.
For three days the only actions on
the east bank of the Meuse have been
centered there with the habitual
preparation in heavily concentrated
artillery fire with a finishing touch in
the formf of a couple of hours of heavy
shelling with suffocating and tear pro
voking gas projectiles.
After a bombardment with high ex
plosives lasting eight hours and the
use of gas for another hour or two
the Germans, would attack in two
columns simultaneously on two flanks.
The consequence Is that the unprece
dented carnage of the battle of Ver
dun goes on.
Yesterday the whole front, beaten
by gas projectiles, was overhung by
a yellowish cloud of cholorine vapor
which seemed to be suspended from
the sky. When the cloud lifted the
Germans bounded forward seemingly
indifferent to thick death dealing cur
tains of fire from the French artillery.
Some of thefli got throug^-'btrt' only
to find that'the Iriifach had abandoned
the first line trenches to allow the
gas cloud to dissipate.
German reinforcements were sent
up to fortify the trenches but before
they had reached the line the French
came back with an Irresistible coun
ter attack and in a few minutes drove
the Germans from the few points
where they had penetrated the
trenches.
On the eastern front the Russians
have stopped a big offensive move
ment by the Germans in the region of
the Ikskull bridge. The big guns of
both sides have been active at vari
ous points.
The Russians report continued
gains against the Turks in tl^e region
of Erzerum. The Turks are said to
have regrouped their forces and are
now stubbornly resisting the three
Russian main lines of advance into
their territory.
The AustrianB have brought into
the campaign against the Italians
artillery described by Rome as new
and very powerful.
ACTIVE IN BALKANS.
Paris, April 12.—Resumption of vio
lent cannonading along the Greek
frontier in the vicinity of Gievgeli and
Doiran is reported in a dispatch from
Saloniki to the Journal. It 1b said the
French artillery had the advantage.
It is also reported that the Ger
manic allies captured the fortified
position at Beve Tepe, but this has
not been confirmed.
GERMANS GAIN GROUND.
Berlin, April 12.—German trcfeps in
the operations against Verdun yester

Bluefleld, W. Va., April 12.—Three
persons were killed, a workman and
two children, when the plant of the
Dupont Powder Co. at Nemours,
Mercer county, eight miles from here,
was blown to pieces by, four explo
sions early today. I The "force of the
explosion was such that houses in the
little village were wrecked. The dead
children were buried in the ruins of
their home near the powder mill.
The principal damage was done by
the first explosion which is said to
have completely destroyed the build
ing in which it occurred. The suc
ceeding explosions were believed to
have been caused by flying embers
and were of less Intensity.
Details of the explosion are lacking.
The plant has been working day and
night on war orders.

GRANGE MISTAKEN
ON TAXATION IDEA
Legislation Needed to Get
Better Results Without
increasing the Cost
The action of Wapello County Pa
mona grange in opposing the plan of
the Greater Iowa association for coun
ty option in the matter of road build
ing,' has brought a response from D.
W. Norris of Marshalltown editor of
the Marshalltown Times-Republican
and one of the foremost good roads
boosters in the state. Following is Mr.
Norris' letter:
Editor Courier: I wish to correct an
apparent misunderstanding of the pur
poses of those who desire better roads
in Iowa as It was expressed in resolu
tions by a grange meeting and publish
ed in your paper.
Nobody Is out to bond Iowa for forty
millions or any millions except as the
people of each county, or township, or
special district vote to bond them
selves and inasmuch as the farmers
cast two-thirdB of the votes in this
state they will have a great deal to
say about the bonds and the kind of
roads to be built with them.
Iowa farmers are putting up $11,000
000 every year now for road and bridge
taxes and they get nothing but mud
roads for their money. There are
twenty-six states in the union that
have more miles of hard roads, gravel
and otherwise, than Iowa has upon less
tax money per annum. They Issue
bonds so as to distribute the first cost
of a permanent grade or bridge over
a period of years. In some states they
string out this first cost over twenty
and in aome forty years $nd they build
permanenr?oad8 B6 tlitfy go.
In Iowa we spent $7,000,000 last year
upon dirt Toads and less than $2,000
000 was classed as permanent work.
Over $5,000,000 was washed away this
{winter and will have to be done over
again.
In the next twenty years that waste
will amount to $100,000,000 without
any bonds.
Your own county will spend nearly
$4,000,000 during the next twenty
years upon its county mads and
bridges at the present rate of taxation.
allowing for a normal increase in auto
money. What will you get for this
money? What have you to show for
the money spent during the last twen
ty years? Just mud.
Clay, Hardin, Buena Vista, Sac, Dick
inson, Emmet, Cerro Gordo and Black
Hawk counties have decided through
their boards of supervisors this spring
to permanently grade and gravel their
entire county road systems within
from three to five years and issue
bonds.
The board, of supervisors can bond
county road and bridge revenues un
der section 403 of the code. In each
of these counties the estimate!'' show
that the people can have these roads
•to use at once and can pay off the
bonds with interest and maintain the
roads within from the eighth year to
the twelfth year without increasing a
single tax levy.
In some of these counties it would
have taken them thirty years to put
their county roads to grade at the
present rate of progress. The average
county in Iowa is putting* to permanent
grade only five miles per annum with
160 miles in its county road system
alone. It will take thirty years in
Iowa to permanently grade our county
road system at our present rate of
progress and 100 years to gravel it,
and yet we will waste $5,000,000 out of

U. 8. ADMIRAL 8AY8 LOGICAL
PLAN SHOULD BE DEVI8ED,
THEN CARRIED OUT.
Washington, D. C., April 12.—
Secretary Daniels' refusal to per
mit Rear Admiral Fiske to read a
paper before the Navy league
convention here today stirred up
a wave of denunciation of the sec
retary In the meeting and drew
hisses from one part of the hall.
The admiral's paper, previously
published In Naval Institute, an of
ficial publication of the navy war
college, was read by William
Mather Lewis of Lake Forest, III.,
while the meeting cheered round-
Washington, D. C., April 12. —Lack
of logical method in the development
of the American navy was deplored by
Rear Admiral Bradley A. Fiske, U. S.
N., today before the navy league of the
United 8tates. The admiral's paper
was read by' a delegate.
"In the elementary parts of the
naval profession," said the paper, "we
do very well. But of the higher
branches, particularly strategy, we
have little clea'r conception. We are
forced to admit that the German meth
ods are better adapted to produce
economically a navy fitted to contend
successfully in war against an enemy.
In Germany the development of the
navy has been strictly along the lines
of a method carefully devised before
hand in our country no method, at
least no logical method, whatever is
apparent."
Comparing the American navy with
that of England, Admiral Fiske declar
ed that it was coherent policy of de
velopment and wisdom of strategy
^established which more than any other
factor has made Great Britain
the mistress of the seas and almost the
mistress of the world.
Admiral Fiske pointed out that in
this country congress alone decides
what vessels shalT be "built and how
many officers and men shall wear the
uniforms.
Helpless Before Japs.
"If a Japanese fleet convoying troop
.transports should appear off the coast
of California,, or adjacent Mexico, with
the command that we abandon our
Asiatic exclusion policy or fight, and
the canal was blocked, I doubt not we
should instantly abandon our ex
clusion policy," was the startling as
sertion of Henry A. Wise Wood of
New York, formerly a member of the
naval advisory board.
Germany, Japan and Russia were
placed by Mr. Wood in the active
group of sea power nations with one
or more of which the United States
might become involved in war, while
he put Great Britain, France, Italy and
Austria in the passive group.
A fit naval policy for the United
States required, said Mr. Wood, an At
lantic force superior to that of Ger
many, a Pacific force superior to that
of Japan and protection, for the Pan
ama canal.
How To Get Money.
Isaac M. Seligman, New York bank
er, telling how preparedness should be
advanced, recommended increases of
the income tax, an inheritance tax, if
necessary, and additional revenues
from the tariff and from various
classes of stamp taxes.
The weakness of the American army
and navy was pictured by Charles G.
Curtis of New York who attributed
most of the trouble to the fact that this
country has no defense commission to
advise the president and congress and
that the navy has no general staff.
SUGAR .BILL IS
JOINT COMMITTEE FROM HOUSE
AND SENATE GIVING IT
CONSIDERATION.
Washington, D. C., April 12.—The
sugar tariff bill, passed by the senate
late yesterday by a vote of 40 to 32,
went to a conference of the two houses

the measure is in prospect. The bill is
a substitute for the house free sugar
repeal resolution and would extend
the present duty of one cent a pound
on sugar until May 1,1920.
With the sugar tariff bill temporar
ily disposed of, the senate resumed de
bate on the army reorganization bill.
Final action on the bill will come next
Tuesday when, by agreement, a vote
is to be taken.
