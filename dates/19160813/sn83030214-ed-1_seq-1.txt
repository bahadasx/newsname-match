the rest of the National Guard units

8. With the 20,00. to 2,".,000 additional
guanlsmen this ordci affects, the num?
ber of troops on thc border will total
1.5,090. With the troops in Mexico the
aggregate number is 175,000.
Seeretary Baker announced that the
Mexican situation had not induced thia
order, but that lt was intended solely
to relieve thousand? of troops held in
mobilization camps because their units
are only a few men under thc fixed
J minimum strength.
To-day's order sends the troopg from

War Department officials said the
troops are rcstive in camp and there
seemed to be no Min.ulus to raeraitiag
while there was no prospect of move?
ment to thc border. They now expect
most cf the regiments will be filled be?
fore the troops leave.
But this new move to expedite the
Mobilization. after recent announcc
ments that enough troops were already
on the border for emergency purposes,
ir, believed to be due also to thc
Hughes arraignment of the Adminis
trition's ia.Aei.BCjr. Although eight
weeks have elapsed since thc mobiliza?
tion or.!' r wa- issued. some states have
. single BOldiS. to thc fron

so fallen off in some locahties that

WILL AID SUFFRAGE,
WILSON TELLS WOMEN
Says He Will Do All ln His Pow
er to Help Movement.
Denver, Aug. 12. -President Wilson
oatlined his position on equal suffrage
for women in a letter to tbe Jane Jef?
ferson Democratic Club, a woman's or
ejaalaatioa.
"One- of the Mrongest forces behind
the equal suffrage sentiment of the
cot'ntry," said the President, "is the
r.ow demonstrated fact that in suffrage
Btataa women interest themselves in
publie questions, study them thorough
ly, form their opinions and divide, *as
men do. eoncerning them.
"Both greaf political parties of the
nation have in their recent platform*
favored the extension of suffrage to
wemen through state action. and I do
not see how their candidate* can con
rlstently disregard these official decla
rr.tions. I shall endeavor to make the
declaration of my own party in thi*
matter effectual by every influence that
I can properly and legitimately exer
cise."
Woman's part in the progress of the
race, the letter says, "is as important
as man's." "And suffrage and service
f o hand in hand." it adds. "The war in
Kurope has forever net at rest the no
tion that nations depend in times of
Btftaa wholly upon their men."

Wing Against the Car?

[n- I'abla to Tha Tribune.]
London, Aug. 12.?The whole line
of the River Stripa in Galicia was
seized by the Russians to-day.
The army of vort Bothmer, which
has held this strongly fortified posi?
tion since last winter, was compelled
by the powerful pressure of the Rus?
sians north and south to fall baek
hastily toward the west. To-night
the Austrians are probably in
trenched behind the Zlota Lipa
River, prepared to make a last stand
before they retreat to positions be?
fore Lemberg.
The menace to his flanks and rear,
rather than any frontal ainovement,
led von Bothmer to surrender the
Stripa line. Sakharoff on the north,
and Letchitsky on the south, had
gradually elosed in upon the Aus?
trian wings. Yesterday's develop
ments brought the threat to a crisis.
Von Bothmer chose to give up terri?
tory rather than expose his troops to
envelopment.
This decision was expected. All
through their offensive the Russians
have fought to weaken the enemy's
forces?those of the Austrians par
ticularly?rather than to gain
ground. To have bagged von Both?
mer's army entirely would have been
a greater stroke for them than the
occupation of many times the amount
of territory held by him.
Ru**ians Ready for Lemberg.
The seizure of the Stripa line of
fortitieations disposes of the last
stretch of the great wall which the
Austro-German armies erected la*t
winter from the Pripet marshes to the
Rumanian frontier. The immediate
result of its fall is to put the Rus?
sians in a far better position to strike
at Lemberg. SakharorT's capture of
several points on the Tarnopol
Krasne-Lemberg road of retreat makes
it probable that von Bothmer led his
forces baek over the southwest rail?
road branchinf* at Potutory into two
lines which run into Lemberg.
Letchitsky'* right winj- already has
reached a po.int on the north bank of
the Dniester which is wgst of the
Zlota Lipa, and the capture of Halitz,
expected at almost any hour, would
enable the Russian commander to
move in the rear of any enemy posi?
tion* on the Zlota Lipa. For this rea?
son it is not believed that von Both?
mer will be able to hold a line on the
Zlota Lipa long.
Ruaaian Line Stralghtened.
From this position the Austrian*
must retire to the Bug-Gnita Lipa
line and there make their last fight to
hold the tialician eapital. Meanwhile
the Austrian retreat will permit the
Russian* to straighten their whole
front in thi* region. shorten their
line* and ma?s their men and guns for
sharp thrusts at almost any part of
the ring of" Lemberg defences.

Freneh Naval Captain
Denies Story of
Orderly.
Pensacola, Fla., Aug. 12. -The Deutsch?
land, first sub-Atlantic liner, was sunk
' on August 8 by a British patrol boat,
according to an orderly of Captain
Leskurt, commander of the Freneh ar-'
mored cruiser Amiral Aube. On that
day, the orderly said, a wireless mes
sage was received by the Amiral Aube
i saying that the patrol boat had sunk
the Deutschland that^ morning.
According to tha orderly, the radio i
dispatch told how the submarine was
sighted while running on the surface
at night, and was sent to the bottom
just as she attempted to submerge at
daybreak.
George V.'. How*, Freneh consular
\ agent here, to-night dacdared the itory
jof the sinkfng of the Deutschland was I
entirely without foundation.
Captain Leskurt later denled the ru
j niors. He asserted he had received no
j information whatever about the
j Deutschland.
Came for Documenta.
Captain Leskurt told the Collector
! of the Port Xhat he had come solely to
j get some important documents from
the Freneh Consul here, and that he
would go to sea again to-morrow morn- j
ing. Until he landed and went to the
custom house it had been understood
that he had run short of fucl and sup
plies.
To the Collector's suggestion that he
, might take on coal and supplies suffi
I cien_ to make his nearest home port,
the captain replied that his stores were i
i ample, and that he would leave early
I to-morrow.
| ?The Freneh consul had some .very'
important papers which I desired,"
said Captain Leskurt. "I came up from
Martinique, and inasmueh as I had
been cruising in the Gulf for the last
ten days, I decided to come into Pen
IBCla and get them.'*
Local shipping men believe the war-'
ship is on patrol duty, off the Gulf
coast and has been examining harborI
entrances to ascertaf. if a German '
submarine eould enter any of the Gulf
ports. For the last ten days the crew*
of German and Austrian merchant
ships laid up here have been telling
German sympathizers that the Bremen,
the Deutschland's sister ship, had se?
lected Pensacola as her port of entry
and that Allied warships were on the
lookout for her.
Consul Gasa Aboard.
Freneh Consul Howe snent a few
minutes aboard the cruiser soon after
she arrived and returned to the city.
Half an "hour later he returned, pre
sumably to deliver the documents to
the Freneh orficer. The consul said he
did not know their contents.
Lieutenant Barnes, of the I'nited
States destroyer Rowe, went aboard
the Amiral Aube late in thc afternoon
and was joined there by officers from
the United States aviation station at
Fort Barrancas. There was a confer?
ence lasting half an hour.
It was learned that the cruiser left
Martinique two weeks ago and has
about forty German prisoners aboard,
some of whom were captured several
months ago.

Norfolk Observers
Doubt Orderly's Story
Norfolk, Va., Aug. 12. Marine ob?

to credit th* Freneh orderly's *torv
that a British patrol boat had lunk the
j Deutachlan'd! 'Tli'ey'poi'nfed out lhat on
August 8 the submarine was six __><

London, Aug. 12.?The French
have struck another heavy blow in
the great Allied push. While the
Russians were sweeping the line of
the Stripa and the Italians were
pushing onward over the Carso pla?
teau, Foch tore a breach three and
three-quarters miles long in tho third
German line north of the Somme.
Thus, with their arnries advancing
on three f ronts, ended what has been
for the Allie3 the most splendid week
of the war. The outstanding fact
of that week is that the Allies have
taken full measure of their enemy.
If their present output of guns and
shells continues, they can break
through at almost any point at which
they attack.
The Russians and the Italians have
smashed the foe's lines on wide
f ronts, but they were enabled to win
these victories because the British
and French are holding 122 divisiona
?a million and a half mep-?of tha
Kaiser's best troops on the Western
front.
Atree on Military Plana.
Lloyd George and Briand in confer?
ence to-day reachei a complae agree?
ment on all qu-stU 1* of military op?
eration. At the *a. e time the Hun
garian po'itical leiders arrived at
Vienna to confer with the Austrian
Kmperor after hi* interviews with the
German Imperial Chancellor and For?
eign Minister. The great Allied drive
has begun to tell.
The French victory to-day caused
great elation in London. It demon
stratod that the Allied offensive in
Plcardy is r.ot spent, and showed once
more the power that still re.sides in the
French arm*.
From Hardecourt to the Somme
Foch's troops assailed the third Qaf*
man line to-day, and evorywhere they
attaeked they broke through. Their
charge took all the German trenehe*
and fortined works to a depth of from
one-third to two-thirds of a mile Thi.*

Maarepas PenetraterJ.
Afteh the third lme had been reached
the French dashed forward and pene
trated the southern part of the village
of Maurepas, on the road to Comblea,
and seized the slope* of Hill 109, di
rectly north of Clery. Foch'* prison?
ers in this action already total more
than a thousand.
These ?ueces*es put Combles in im
mment peril. When the remaininj*
parts of Maurepa* fall, Combles, which
lie* on the Bapaume road, seven milea
*outh and east, will be flanked. The
British, pushing east from Guillemont,
threaten it from the north. I'aught be?
tween entilading fires from both arnnei,
it cannot hold out long.
Comblea Capture Imminent. j
Their victory to-day brought the
French to within two mile* of Comblea
and atraughtene.l their front north of
Clery. When the British advance from
Guillemont, which i* alao ?eriou?ly
I threatened, a new east and we?t line
extending beyond Bapaume will be held
by the Allie*. This formation, which
proved.so successful in the earlier dayi
1 of the offensive, will give th? AUtSfl an
I other opportunity of striking the Teu
