Austro-Germans Forced to Give
Up Entire Stripa
Line.
London, Aug. 12.—French and Rus­
sian forces have gained additional
important successes over the armies
of the Central powers in northern
France and Galicia, respectively.
A sustained attack over a front of
three and three-quarters miles by the
French against the German third line
north of the Somme resulted in the
capture of all trenches to a depth
from a third to two-thirds of a mile.
The line of the victorious French ad­
vance extends from Hardecourt to the
Somme river at Buscourt.
Occupy Village.
The village of Maurepas, which has
been the center of much of the se­
vere fighting was partly occupied by
the French in the same assault. Ger­
man prisoners to the number of 1,000
and 30 machine guns were captured.
On the eastern front, the Austro
Germans have been forced to give up
the entire :Strlpa line from Tarnopol
to Buczacz, which they had held since
last winter. The capture of the
Stripa line by the Russians follqwed
the taking of several towns in the re
gion of,Tarnopol.

President Wilson Sends Letter
Containing His Views to Dem­
ocratic Club.
Denver, Aug. 12.—President Wilson
outlined his position on equal suffrage
for women in a letter "to the Jane Jef­
ferson Democratic club, a woman's or­
ganization, and made public tonight
at an annual banquet.
"One of the strongest forces behind
equal suffrage sentiment of the coun­
try," says the president, "is the now
demonstrated fact that in equal suf­
frage states women interest them­
selves in public questions, study them
and divide, as men do, concerning
them." deferring to advocates of
state, and natioi^al action on suffrage,
the letter continues:
"Both great political parties of the
nation have in their recent platforms
favored the extension of suffrage to
women through state action, and I do
not see how their candidates can con­
sistently disregard these official de­
clarations. I shall endeavor to make
the declaration of party in this mat­
ter effectual by every influence that
I can properly and legitimately exer­
cise."

Chicago, Aug. 12.—In a statement
issued today by the Western Demo­
cratic headquarters, Willard Sauls
bury of Delaware, chairman of the
committee which will direct the con­
test in the various senatorial elec­
tions in the different states, expressed
the belief that the Democrats will not
only retain their present majority in
the senate but may gain at least four
seats in the upper house of congress.
This year 34 United States senators
will be elected.
The Democratic senatorial cam­
paign in the various states will be di­

composed of Chairman Saulsbury,
Senator Walsh of Montana, manager
of the Western Democratic headquar­

AT BORDER SAYS
CAPT.inOH
A Few Indisposed, Nothing Seri­
ous, Declares Officer of First
Who Returns.
MUSTERING NEW MEN
TO BEGIN AT ONCE
Reports of sickness at the camp of
the First North Dakota regiment,
Mercedes, have been exaggerated, de­
clares Capt. H. Sorenson, inspector
of small arms of the state's soldiers,
who returned yesterday from the bor­
der.
Capt. Sorenson, in common with all
other inspectors of small arms, has
been mustered out because of the de­
sire to cut down tljie number of of­
ficers as far as possible. It is be­
lieved, however, that he will be ap­
pointed chief mustering^, officer for
Officers From Border.
Adjutant General Tharaldson has
received word from the war depart­
ment that the mustering officers will
be appointed from men who have
been at the border. Seven men will
be appointed, a captain, two commis­
sioned officers, two sergeants, two
corporals and two privates. The men
will be divided into two squads. Fort
Lincoln has been designated the chief
mustering point. Other places will
be designated on recommendation of
the adjutant general.
As fast as they are mustered in
and formed in squads, the "rookies"
will be sent to the border. Between
500 and GOO men are needed to re­
cruit the regiment to fighting
strength.
Few Are Indisposed.
No additional regiment will be
formed until the ranks of the First
are filled.
"Reports of sickness have been
greatly exaggerated," said Capt. Sor­
enson, last night. "A few are indis­
posed but there is nothing serious.
The camp is on high ground and
there is no danger of it being flooded
by an overflow of the Rio Grande.
Reports to that effect are false.
"All were waitiing for pay day
when I left, but the work of making
out the payroll had commenced. The
boys have not received any money
since they were mustered in.
Building For Hospital.
"Officers of the First have made
arrangements to,have a large brick
building used as a camp hospital.
This will insure all sick boys the best
of treatment.
"Major Bridgeman, formerly sta­
tioned here with the Fourteenth In­
fantry, is the chief medical officer at
the base hospital, located at Llano
Grande.
No Food Shortage.
"Mail is delivered twice a day.
Each company gets 200 pounds of ice
daily. The water Is good. There is
no shortage of food. The militia and
regular officers are co-operating in
nice style. No trouble has been had
with any of the men.
"One of arranza's aides sent word
to the Seventh New York Infantry
that he would like to come across and
see the American militia. The out­
posts sent back word that he would
be welcome and that Cornelius Van
derbilt was sending over his twin-sjx
for him.
Surprised at Showing.
The Mexican reviewed the regi­
ment, hospital corps, ambulance and
all. Afterwards he expressed himself
as much surprised at the complete­
ness of the equipment and splendid
discipline of the men.
"'We Mexicans,' he said, 'have the
idea that the militia is nothing but a
disorganized mob. But I find that it
is a highly efficient fighting body.'"

AFTERMATH OF
LONG LITIGATION
Trespass Is Grounds on Which
Damage Plea Is
Based.
Fargo, N. D., Aug. 12.—President
E. F.Ladd of North Dakota Agricul­
tural college was served with papers
in a $100,000 damage action, launch­
ed by the Calumet Baking Powder
company of Chicago, yesterday, while
he was in Chicago.
"Trespass" is the plea on which
the big suit is started, and grows out
of President Ladd's fight on the sale
of Calumet products in North Dakota,
which terminated recently in the fed­
eral court with a decision that gave
the company power to sell in this
state, but barred the use of certain
tests to promote its sale.
The Calumet company's suit
against Ladd was started in federal
court in Chicago. Ladd was passing
through that city, when the papers
were served on him.
Ladd for a long time barred the
sale of Calumet in the state because
of the addition of albumen to the
powder. It was contended this was
added to make the so-called water
glass test. The federal courts hold
that the so-called water glass test
shall not be used for the purpose of
advertising Calumet products, in, that
set •up' & "Fdrs'e'%andar3
as compared with other powders,
when, as a matter of fact, the addi­
tion of albumen does not in any man­
ner improve the products.
PLOT TO SEIZE
CITY FRUSTRATED
Revolutionists Who Attempte to
Invade Chihuahua City Are
Seized.
Chihuahua City, Aug. 12.—'A revolu
tionary plot to seize Chihuahua City
has been frstrated, General Trevino
announced today.
General Trevino asserted that the
movement has been known to govern­
ment officials for some time, but that
arrests were not made until as many
men implicated as possible could be
identified.
General Reys, for'mer outlaw, now
holding a de facto command, who
was approached, gave military author­
ities the first intimation of the plot.
Investigation in the hope of identi­
fying others of the plotters is being
continued, it was announced, and it
was stated also that the prisoners
now held will be tried by court mar­
tial and, if found guilty, will be exe­
cuted.
FEELING OF APPREHENSION
IS GREATLY RELIEVED
Washington, Aug. 12.—Notice from
Special Agent Rogers at Mexico City
to the state department today that
the recent Carranza decree prohibit­
ing foreign stockholders in Mexican
corporations from claiming the pro­
tection of their home' government was
not retroactive, served to relieve in a
measure the feeling of apprehension
created by earlier reports.
Mr. Rogers reported that the de­
cree was intended to apply to corpor­
ations hereafter formed and appar­
ently it will not affect the existing
big American and other foreign oil
and mining companies. Thus, de­
partment officials see no urgent ne­
cessity for immediate protest.
It is known that Carranza paved]*1
the way for the decree by negotiation
with nearly all governments of South
and Central America. Just what were
the results has not developed, but it
is known that for many years past
public opinion in Latin-America had
inclined strongly in favor of the old
drgo doctrine, which denies the right
of an aliien to appeal to his own gov­
ernment for the protection of his life
or property interests against .the gov­
ernment or the country where his
possessions are located.
FINE PICKPOCKETS.

pockets, were fined |25 each tonight

Republican Nominee Scores Wil­
son and Party in Speech
at Butte.
"HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
OPPOSED TQ PROCESS''
Reiterates Statements Against
Pork Barrel and Rivers and
Harbors Bill.
Butte, Mont., Aug.'12.—Charles E.
Hughes, addressing an audience in
the ball park here today, renewed his
declarations of conviction and contin­
ued his attacks on the administration
for its foreign and Mexican policies,
its appointments and its tariff views.
"The Democratic party," the nomi­
nee said, "always has been a party of
opposition to progress.
There has not been a great national
movement in response to a national
demand that has not had to run over
the prostrate form of the Democratic
party."
Again Scores Administration.
The nominee scored the administra­
tion for what he called failure to carry
out its party platform, notably the
planks in the 1912 platform declaring
for the maintenance of American
rights abroad.
"This administration in the first in­
stance organized it state department,"
Mr. Hughes said, "so as to reduce its
potency 25 per cent in jhe eyes of the
world."
The nomtaee:reit(/«$&crhis declara­
tion that he was against the "pork
barrel" ethics of graft and character­
ized the last rivers and harbors bill as
a spectacle of "shocking waste."
'lAnd it will continue," he said, "un­
til some American executive is will­
ing to take his political life in his
hand and come before the American
people and say: 'Here stand for
business-like methods of government,
come what will.'
"Until that time comes we still will
have to get along in a haphazard way.
For the nineteenth century that might
have done, but it won't do for the
twentieth."
Leaves For Spokane.
Mr. Hughes left here at 7:45 p. m.
for Spokane, where he will spend to­
morrow, resting. Reviewing the first
week of his campaign, the nominee
issued a statement saying he was
much gratified by the receptions giv­
en him and that he expected much
support in the northwest. The hoarse­
ness which bothered him for a day or
two left him and he said he felt better
at the present time than at any time
since his nomination.
Before leaving Butte, Mr. Hughes
went 3,000 feet underground to one
of the big copper mines here, where
he spent an hour inspecting the work­
ings of the mine.

E CONFERENCE
COMES TO AN END
Colorado Springs, Colo., Aug. 12.—
A three-day conference of the Nation­
al Woman's party was concluded here
today and leaders tonigh|t were de­
parting for various points in twelve
suffrage states to carry out campaign
plans outlined at the final session. Act­
ive opposition to the Democratic ad­
ministration for failure to pass the
national suffrage amendment was the
chief task assigned to the workers.
National officers instructed the organ­
izers and speakers that the election
policy of the party was essentially
one of opposition to Democratic can­
didates. Late today the veteran equal
suffrage campaigners were "breaking
in young inexperienced workers at
ifteet meetings. Under Mrs. Thomp­
son, of North Carolina, a number of
women made their debut as public
speakers. For the most part the ad­
dresses were delivered fluently and
with considerable oratorical effect.
CITIZENS PROTEST
SPEED VIOLATIONS
A petitiion has been presented to
the village council of Hazen protest­
ing against the speed violations,
which are becoming of daily occur­
rence. The petition alleges that au­
tomobile owners and drivers, partic­
ularly, are in the main the offenders
and that the terrific speed attained
by sofee has become a serious men­
ace to "the life and limb of pedestri­
ans, and especially to the children
that are constantly on the streets' of
the village.—Hazen Star,

That Men in Mobilization Camps
Became Restive Is Reason
for Move.

tional guard units included in the
president's call of June 18 not yet on
the Mexican border were ordered to
the border today by the war depart­
ment.
Between 20,000 and 25,000 addition­
al troops will thus be added :to the
border forces. National guard forces
there will number approximately 125,
000 and the total of all troops on the
border or in Mexico will be 175,000.
Secretary Baker made a formal an­
nouncement that the troop movement
had nothing whatever to do with the
Mexican situation as such, and was
solely to relieve thousands of troops
now held in mobilization camps only
because they lack a few recruits to
bring units up to fixed minimum
strength.
Today's orders send the troops from
Kentucky, Ohio and Vermont to the
border as soon as transportation can
be arranged for them and the govern­
ment will move all the others as soon
as they are properly equipped.
War department officials decided on
their action because the troops are
restive in camps and there seems to
be no stimulus to recruiting while
there is no prospect of movement to
the border. They now expect most of
the regiments will be filled before the
troops leave.
N. M. OLDS DISPOSES OF
TELEPHONE EXCHANGE
'A deal was consumated this week
whereby the North Dakota Independ­
ent Telephone Co. of Bismarck pur­
chased from N. M. Olds of Hazen the
franchise and equipment of the local
telephone exchange, together with the
building and lot occupied by the cent­
ral office.
The transfer involved a consider­
able amount as the local system has
grown rapidly since its installation a
couple of years ago and constant im­
provements have been made by Mr.
Olds, which were in keeping with the
rapid growth of the village. The new
management will put a crew of men at
work making alterations, extensions
and improvements and it is expected
that the line will keep pace with the
growth and demands of the village.—

New York, Aug. 12.—Notwithstand­
ing the failure of mediation to bring
together the representatives of the
railroads of the country and their
400,000 employes on the demands for
an eight-hour day and time and a
half for overtime, the threatened
strike that would tie up 225 railroad
systems and throw 1,800,000 railroad
workers out of employment, may be
averted by arbitration. An agree
ment to this effect may be entered
(into tomorrow, it was predicted here
tonight.

situations and contradictory reportB,

Conciliation, which is striving to ef­
fect a peaceful settlement at the spe­
cial request of President Wilson,
viewed the situation optimistically.
It has been virtually conceded that
arbitration under the present provi­
sions of the Newlands act would
not be satisfactory to the men, but
an expansion of the board provided
for may be accepted by them with
the proviso that only their present
demands are to be arbitrated. The
railroads have maintained that in the
event of arbitration not only the de­
mands of their employes, but the
roads' "contingent proposition,"
which is based on the eight-hour day,
but eliminates the double compensa­
tion features, should be arbitrated.
Ready to Withdraw.
Several times during the day's ne­
gotiations between the mediators and
the trainmen it seemed as if the men
were on the point of withdrawing
from further parley. When the situ­
ation reached a point where it was re­
ported President Wilson had inter­
vened, A. G. Garretson, president of
the Order of Railway Conductors au­
thorized a statement which clearly
indicated the brotherhood .would not
oppose such an action.
Will Welcome the President.
"An invitation from the president
of the United States," said Mr. Gar­
retson, "is tantamount to a command.
If he summons us to Washington, we
will go. But it must be understood
that the president has no more power
in this matter than the mediators."

Statements.
Pensacola, Fla., Aug. 12.—The Gm*

Deutschland, was sunk by a British
patrol boat on the morning of Atigitet
8, acording to a statement made bare
by an orderly of Captain Lique, com­
manding the French armored cruiser.
Admiral Aubue, which put into port
today. Captain Lique tonight refused
to confirm or deny the report.
According to the orderly, the radio
dispatch told how the submarine was
sighted while running on the surface
at night and was sent to the bottom
just p.r ,?he attempted to submerge at
daybreak.
First Allied Craft.
The Admiral Aube, an .iiqpMl%e
looking four-funn?led craft, Jrt#med
into Pensacola harbor tod«$' ane
dropped anchor. She is the flrst al­
lied warship to enter, an American
port since the war began, and the
event caused a flurry of netted eun*
osity along the water front.
Captain Licjue informed tha collect­
or of the port that he had op* wl*
jy,. to yg»t-some-important dnoaments
from the French consul here afcdth«t
he would go to sea again tomorrow
morning. Until he landed and wsns 'r
to the customs house, it had beeh
understood that he had run ihort. (ft ".
fuel and supplies.
To the collector's suggestion'that
he might take on coal and Buppltti
to make the nearest port, the captain
replied that his supplies were aflpple
and he would leave early tomorrow.
Important Papers.
"The French consul has some very
important papers, which I desire,"
said Captain Lique, "and I came up
from Martinique and inasmuch sb I
had been cruising in the gulf for the
past ten days, I decided to come into
Pensacola and get them."
Local shipping men believe the
warship is on patrol duty off the gulf
coast and has been examining har­
bor entrances to ascertain if a Ger­
man submarine could enter any of
the gulf ports. For the past ten days
the crews of German and Austrian
ships laid up here have been telling
German sympathizers that the Bre­
men, the Deutschland's sister ship,
had selected Pensacola as her port
of entry and that the allied warships
were on the lookout for her.
Consul Goes Aboard.
Consul Howe spent a few minutes
aboard the cruiser after she arrived
and returned to the city. Half an.
hour later he returned, presumably
to return the documents to the
French officer. He said he did »ot
know their contents.
Lieutenant Barnes of the United
States destroyer, Rowe, went aboard
the Admiral Aubue late in the after*
noon and was joined there by officers
of the United States a?iation station
at Fort Barrancas. There was a con­
ference lasting half an hour.
It was learned that the cruiser left
Martinique two weeks ajo and has
about 40 German prisoners aboaid.
some of whom wer3 captured severe!
