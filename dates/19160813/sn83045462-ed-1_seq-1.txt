10 AVERT STRIKE,
PRESIDENT MAY 00
TO SCENE OF CLASH
New York Visit Considered as
Possibility if Mediation
Fails to Stop Break.
PERSONAL APPEAL TO MEN
ON BOTH SIDES SUGGESTED
White Hoase Message to Commissioner
Chambers Requests Opportunity
to Act if Deadlock Holds.
TO HALT RAILROAD PARALYSIS
Mediators Informed That Strike !
Must Be Avoided; Prospects of
Agreement Later Declared
More Favorable.
President Wilson is seriously
considering making a trip to New
York in an effort by personal
suasion to avert the monster railroad
strike t.hat threatens to
paralyze the business of the en
tire country.
The President intends to appeal
himself to both the officers of
the four big brotherhoods, representing
400,000 employes engaged
in the movement of trains, who
have taken a strike vote, and to
officials representing the 225 railroad
systems, with 1.700 railroad
subsidiaries, cobwebbing the entire
United States.
He sent word yesterday to
Commissioner William L. Chambers,
who, with the co-operation
of *he United States bureau of
mediation and concilation, is endeavoring,
through mediation, to
reconcile the differences that have
reached a climax in the impending-strike,
that he wjrttM Tttce to
* consult with representatives of
both sides before there is a break.
jiiui c xnvoraoie.
While in telephonic communication i
uith Commissioner Chambers. the!
President asked that he be notified i
just as soon as a strike becomes im- j
minent. Although the President was '
told early in the day that the situation
was critical, word came to the White i
House last night that prospects for an
igreement were more favorable, and
that further conferences will be held.
The President informed the mediators
that the strVce must be avoided, and
that if a deadlock is reached he will
personally take charge and use all the
influence and authority of his office to
prevent any interference with the or'
lierly movement of trains.
He hopes it will not be necessary,
but as a last resort desires personally
to urge upon the parties to the coni;
oversy the disastrous effect upon
themselves and upon the country which
v. ould follow tying up 225 railroads by
a strike.
Still Hopes for Settlement.
While evidently worried over the
situation, he has not given up hope
that a settlement may be reached. He
has taken no stand on the merits of the
arguments presented by either side, but is
understood to believe that there must be
some common ground on which the
employers and employes can meet.
During the day the President received
a petition from representatives of unorganized
railroad employes^ urging
that Congress pass legislation which
would prevent the railroads being
paralyzed by a strike of the members
of the brotherhood, who. it is claimed,
represent only 20 per cent of the employes.
The first petition contained
6,000 names, and it was said that other
larger petitions would come within the
next few days.
Arbitration Agreement
May Result at Today's
Session of Conferees
NEW YORK. August 12?Notwithstanding
the failure of mediation to
bring together the representatives of
the railroads of the country and their
400,000 employes on the demand for an
eight-hour day and time and a half for
overtime, the threatened strike that
would tie up 225 railroad systems and
throw 1,800,000 railroad workers out of
employment, may be averted by ar
Duration. .\n aKreement to this effect
may be entered into tomorrow, it was
predicted here tonight.
At the end of a day of confusing situations
and contradictory reports, the j
leaders of the four railroad brother- i
ho- ds and the members of the United j
S' d?s board of mediation and concilia- j
tion, which is striving to effect a peaces
fu! settlement at the special request of
Pre: idept Wilson, viewed the situation I
optimistically.
It has been virtually conceded that j
arbitration under the present provi- j
sions of the New lands act would not be !
satisfactory to the men, but an expansion
of the board provided for may be j
ac< epted by them, with the proviso that
oiily their present demands are to be
arbitrated. The railroads have maintained
that in the event of arbitration,
nbt only the demands of their employes,
but the roads' "contingent proposition."
which is based on the eight-hour day.
but eliminates the double compensation
features, should be arbitrated.
President's Action Approved.
? Several timea during the day's negotiation*
between the mediators and the
trainmen it seemed as if the men were
on the point of withdrawing from further
parley. When the situation reach
Ied a point where it was reported President
Wilson had intervened. A. B. Gar,
retson. president of the Order of Railway
Conductors, authorized a statement
which clearly indicated the
t brotherhoods would not oppose such ac|
tion.
I "An invitation from the President of
the United States." said Mr. Garretson,
J "is tantamount to a command. If he
I summons us to Washington, we will go.
I But it must be understood that the
j President has no more power in this
. matter than the mediators."
Although the mediators and the rail- j
I load managers refused to discuss the j
j events of the day, Mr. Garretson had
( no hesitation in doing so, saying that
I mediation having failed, he was under
j 110 further obligations to maintain secrecy
about the negotiations. He said
the double compensation feature was
the stumbling block.
Mr. Garretson declared double compensation
agreements are in effect on
virtually every railroad in the country and |
that they were won by the men after j
serious effort extending over a period
of thirty years.
I
Adjourned Until Today.
' Because the mediators cotild not give
! the trainmen assurance that the railj
roads would wave the "contingent
proposition," the men adjourned until
tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock when
the mediators will again report. The
mediators met the railroad managers
only for a brief period during the afternoon,
but said they had satisfactory j
sessions with both sides. A high railroad
official declared, however, that
there would be no backdown on their
part until the other side showed a disposition
to meet them half way.
The next move is up to the railroads,
i Mr. Garretson said, in view of the fact
! that they had requested the services *
j of the mediators.

at a dinner given at A^uburn in his hon
or by Charles D. Osborne, one of his
classmates at Harvard.
Ambassador Page, who returned with
his wife to this country yesterday, engaged
rooms at a hotel in Garden City }
as soon as the condition of his daughter-in-law
became serious. Both he and J t
Mrs. Page were at the young woman's : h
bedside when she died.
The younger ^lx?- Page recently re*

ed her expressed th? belief that she
contracted infantile paralysis before 8
returning here, although the disease a
did not manifest itself until yesterday, t
Seven persons in New York city, all
more than eighteen years old. who
have been cured, of the disease, volunteered
today to give some of their t

Health department officials announced
tonight that this has been the high r
record week for the disease since the Q
epidemic developed. Cases reported t
were 1,198, as against 1,117 last week ^
and 912 the previous week. In the list
of new cases and deaths made public
today, a total of 6,140 cases were
shown, with 1,371 deaths.
New Regulations May c
Guard Children Here I
With the return to Washington early ^
this week of Dr. William C. Woodward, ^
health officer, and Dr. J. J. Kinyoun, ^
bacteriologist of the health department, j,
who are in New York studying the in- Q
fantile paralysis epidemic, important
changes in the capital's regulations p
concerning this disease are expected to ti
be made. ^
It is by no means improbable that the h
regulations will be broadened to pro- h
vide for the quarantining of all persons rt
who came in contact with infantile
paralysis cases. At present only isolation
of the patients is required.
Before leaving for the metropolis Dr. 0
Woodward intimated that the regulations
might be revised, but said that
nothing would be done in this direction
until thorough study had been made of
the methods being employed in New c
York. g
No new cases of Infantile paralysis
were reported to the health department
yesterday and there are but three in all b
on record. The disease has appeared it

spread of infantile paralysis, notices fl
are being posted in all stations, wait- ^
ing rooms and other public places on
the Pennsylvania railroad lines east of ti
Pittsburgh and Erie, calling attention
to the necessity of complying with the

HUGHESDENOUNCES
DEMOCRATIOREOORD
Says State Department
Efficiency Is Reduced.
BUTTE. Mont.. August 12.?Charles
E. Hughes, addressing an audience in
the ball park here late today, reviewed
his declaration of convictions and
continued his attack on the administration
for its foreign and Mexican
policy, its appointments and its tariff
views.
"The democratic party," the nominee
said, "has always been a party of opposition
to progress. There has not
been a great national movement in
response to a national demand that
has not had to run over the prostrate
form of the democratic party."
The nominee scored the administration
for what he called failure to carry
out its party platform, notably the
plank in the 1912 platform declaring
for the maintenance of American
rights abroad.
State Department Inefficiency.
"This administration, in the first nistance,
organized its State Department,"
Mr. Hughes said, "so as to reduce
its potency 25 per cent in the
eyes of the world."
The nominee reiterated his declaration
that he was against the "pork
barrel" methods of graft, and characterized
the last rivers and harbors
bill as "a spectacle of shocking
waste."
"And it will continue," he said, "until
some American executive is willing
to take his political life in his hands
and come before the American people
and say: 'Here I stand for businesslike
methods of government, come what
will.'
"Until that time comes we will still
have to get along in a haphazard way.
For the nineteenth century that wav
might have done, but it won't do for
the twentieth."
Off for Spokane.
Mr. Hughes left here at 7:35 p.m. for
Spokane, where he will spend tomorrow,
resting. Reviewing the first week
of his campaign, the nominee issued a
statement, saying he was much gratified
by the reception giv"en him and ex
pected strong support in tne northwest.
The hoarseness which bothered him a
day or two had left him, and he
said he felt better at present than at ;
any time since his nomination.
Before leaving Butte Mr. Hughes
went 3.000 feet underground to the sec- i
ond level of one of the big copper !
mines here, where he spent an hour in- <
specting the workings of the mine.

LETTER OF PRESIDENT
STATES SUFFRAGE VIEW
Democratic Women's Club Is Told
Candidates of Both Parties Are
Bound by Platforms.
ur^i-o vtin, v;ol, augusi iz.?-.f resident
Wilson outlined his position on
equal suffrage for women in a letter j
to the Jane Jefferson Democratic Club, t
a woman's organization, made public ?
tonight at its annual banquet. J
"One of the strongest forces behind
the equal suffrage sentiment of the
country," says the President, "is the now
demonstrated fact that in suffrage ^
states women interest themselves in j
public questions, study them thoroughly,
form their opinions and divide r
as men do concerning them." c
Referring to advocates of state and g
national action on suffrage, the letter
continues:
"Both great political parties of the a
nation have in their recent platforms v
favored the extension of suffrage to
women through state action, and I do
not see how their candidates can con- 6
sistently disregard these official decla- 1!
rations. I shall endeavor to make the I
declaration of my own party in this
matter effectual by every influence that v
I can properly and legitimately exer- h
cise." s
Woman's part in the progress of the t]
race, the letter says, "is as important ?
as man's" and "suffrage and service go a
hand in hand." It adds:
"The war in, Europe has forever set
a.t rest the notions that nations depend
In times of stress wholly upon their
men/' _ _ *

Others Injured When Runaway
Collides With Still
Car.
JOHNSTOWN. Pa., August 12 ?
Twenty-five persons were killed and
iixty-three Injured in a head-on collision
between two crowded trolley;
jars on the line of the Southern Cam- }
bria Traction Company between Echo i
and Brookvale, seven miles from here, ]
today.
Fourteen persons were instantly
killeg. Eleven others died after being
removed from the wreckage. Several
more are in a critical condition and
will probably dfe.
The cause of the accident has not
been determined. Coroner Fitzgerald
it once started an investigation. The
jompany in a statement tonight said
it was absolutely without data on
which to base a report of how the
accident occurred.
Not Enough Doctors.
As soon as word of the wreck was
-eceived here a score of physicians and
lurses was rushed in -^automobiles to
:he scene, followed shortly afterward
>y motor trucks hastily fitted up as
ambulances and several pieces of mo:or
fire apparatus. Because of the
ack df doctors many of the injured
were compelled to wait nearly two
lours for medical treatment. The victims
were loaded into automobiles and
itreet oars and taken to South Fork
ind to Johnstown.
According to persons in the vicinity at
he time or the wreck one car was standng
still near the car barn at Echo when
he other car, in charge of Motorman Anpis
Varner, crashed down a steep grade
md into it. Both cars were demolished
>y the impact. .
Car Believed Wild.
.Shortly before the accident Varner's car ;

PETROGRAD, August 12. via
I London, 10 p.m.?"The whole
region of the main enemy winter
positions before Tarnopol and
Buczacz" has fallen into the possession
of the Russians, according
to the official statement from
general headquarters issued tonight.
Following the capture of' the
important railway junction of
Stanislau, Galicia, Gen. Letchitzky
is pressing with unabated
vigor the movement to turn the
right flank of the army of Gen.
von Bothmer. Halicz, sixteen
miles north of Stanislau, appears
likely to fall before the Russians
in the near future.
The Austrians are falling back
on this point, pursued closely by
Russian cavalry, which is giving
the Teutonic forces no time to reform
their disordered ranks and
prepare to make a serious stand.
Holies Is Real Hey.
Halicz always has been regarded as
the main key to Lemberg. Once the
Russians are in possession of that town
they will have before them no natural
obstacles, and will have plenty of good
roads to Lemberg.
The capture of Monasterzyska, tan
I miles north of the Dniester, by Gen.
1 Scherbatchoff, who threw his troops
across the Zlota Lipa to co-operate
with the forces of Gen. Letchitzky on
the right bank of the Dniester, south
of Mariampol, broadens the line of attack
upon Halicz. The wedge is being
driven relentlessly back of Gen. von
Bothmer's Tarnopol position, and promises
to put this Austrian force in aisack
from which it will And it difficult to
extricate itself.
Fierce battles are progressing along
the Stokhod, with varying success. The
counter offensive attempted by the Germans
north of the Kovel-Sarny railway
appears to have been stopped by the
Russians, who in turn have assumed
the offensive in the vicinity of Lubashev,
forty miles south of Pinsk.
