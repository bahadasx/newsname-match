The taking of Goritza, the "keystone"
of the war on the ItalianAustrian
front, marks the most important
victory of the Italians since
the inception of tin war. Trieste being
the objective point of the Italians
for more than a year, and the fight
being centered around this point, and
adjacent territory for so long a time,
shows that the Italians have joined
in with the allied offensive with
great force.
