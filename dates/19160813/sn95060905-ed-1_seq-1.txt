the "non-part)" and that by reason
of such registration plaintiff cannot
vote with the political party with
which he is actually and In fact affiliat
ed, and that such registration of the
date of May 6th., 1916. ought to be
cancelled by reason of facts that bate
occurred subsequent to the lime of
said registration of plaintiff. In this,
to-wit; that plaintiff has actually and
in fact since said 6th. day of May,
1916, in good faith become affiliated
with the Democratic party"

ures as follows, towit. I. the under
signed elector, do solemnly swear that
my name and signature as signed be

that, being a resident of Upper Low
ell precinct, in Cochise county, Ari
zona. I registered on the 6th. day of
May, 19lCas affiliated with the none!
party: that since the date of such
registration I have changed my politi
cal views and in good faith declare
my affiliation with the democratic
party. I, therefore, request the can
cellation of my registration as afore
said in order that 1 may re-register
and state properly my political party
affiliation. Signed. James A. Chap

knowledged before G. W. Totman as a
notary public
The complaint further alleges that
the defendant refuses to cancel the

"Wherefore, plaintiff prays that a
writ of mandamus be issued, compell
ing defendant, Owen E. Mnrpby, coun
ty recorder of Cochise county, Ari

The decision of the court In this
matter is of extreme Importance as
It will affect thousands of voters In

should the court decide that the rec
order should make the changes It
would affect the change In registra
tion of over 1500 voters or to be
exact with the. registrations up to date
