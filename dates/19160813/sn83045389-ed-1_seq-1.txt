War Department Order Calls for
Militia Remaining in Mob
ilization Camps.
MOVEMENT BEGINS AT ONCE
Order Not Yet Received by Gen
eral Sale or at Camp
Stuart.
WASHINGTON. August 12.?All the
National Guard units Included In Presi
dent Wilson's call on June IS not yet
on the Mexican border were ordcifd
there to-day by the War Department
Between 20,000 and 25.J00 additional
troops will thus be added to the boiler
force. National Guard troops ?'? re
will number approximately 12.".0"f<
the total of all troops on the b< i
or in Mexico will be 175,000. >
Secretary Baker made a formal
nouncement that the troop movement
had nothing whatever to do with the
Mexican situation as such, and was
solely to relieve thousands of troops
now held in mobilization camps only
because they lack a few recruits to
bring units tip to fixed strength.
To-day's ord??r sends the troops from
Kentucky. Ohio and Vermont to the
border as soon as transportation can
he arranged for them, and will move
all the others as soon as they are
properly equipped. War Department
officials decided on their actton because
the troops are restive In camp and
ther* seemed to be no stimulus to re
cruiting while there was no prospect
of movement to the border They now
expect most of the regiments will be
filled before the troops leave.
NO ORDERS TO .MOVE
KKCEIVKI) AT CAMP STl'ART
Neither Adjutant-General Sale nor
officers at headquarters In Camp Stuart
had received notice of the War De
portment order at midnight last night
It is thought probable that the com
mand to leave for Texas will he re
ceived early to-day. Approximately
1.000 men ate fully equipped, with the
exception of necessary horses, anil are
recruited above peaee strength In Camp
Stuart at present.
Adjutant-General Sale has previously
stated the opinion, based on reliable
information, that in the event th* cav
alry was sent to the border horses
would be supplied there. Instead of
being Issued in Richmond. From this
point of view, all the organizations in
Camp Stuart which have been mus
tered in to the Federal service are
properlv equipped. Only the Ports
mouth battery, of the field artillery, is
deficient in equipment, and has not
been mustered in on account of fail
ure to have the minimum number <>f
men.
Although the Blues' cavalry squad
ron was not included in the President's
call of June IS, it was called out a few
days later, and it will probably be
oidered to Texas along with the other
organizations in camp The organiza
tions in camp now which may be con
sidered ready for service include the
field hospital company, the Signal Corps
company,, the engineers company, one
squadron of cavalry and one battalion
of field artillery.
The first troops moved into Camp
Stuart June 25. The organizations
have been there about a month and a
half, while the two infantry regiments
have been in Brownsville. Tex., for a
month.
II K< It EE OF rAUHANZA
IS .NOT IIKTItOACTIVE
WASHINGTON, August 12.?Notice
from Special Agent Rorlgers at Mexico
City to the State Department to-day
that the recent Carranza decree pro
hibiting foreign stockholders in Mexi
can corporations from claiming the
protection of their home governments
was not. retroactive, served to relieve
in a measure the feeling of apprehen
sion created here by earlier reports.
Mr. Rodgers reported that the decree
was intended to apply to corporations
hereafter formed, and apparently It
will not affect the existing hie Ameri
can and other foreign oil and mining
companies Department ofticials indi
cated, however, that the United States
government is by no means prepared
to submit quietly to the creation of any
such precedent as is involved in the
new decree. An attempt to enforce it
probably will he met hv formidable
protests not only from the United
States, but from all the European
powers Interested. It is known that.
Carranza paved the way for the de
cree by extensive negotiation with
nearly all the governments of South
and Central America, seeking stipport
for his position. Just what were the
tangible results has not developed, but
ij^.is well known that for many years
'"public opinion In fcatin-America has in
clined strongly in favor of the old
Drago doctrine, whic-h denies the right
of an alien to appeal to his own gov
ernment for the protection of his life
or property interests against the gov
ernment of the country where his pos
sessions are located.
In each of the several Pan-American!
Congresses held since ISSfl, this doc-|
trine cropped out in one form or an
other, and in eaA>h It was only through
the energetic opposition of the United j
States that It was forced to the back
ground. It was pointed out that an
attempt by the American republics to |
employ such a doctrine probably would
seriously strain the Monroe Doctrine.
The subject may, .come before the
Joint Mexican-American commission,
now In process of organization, when
that body has disposed of the prelimi
nary questions concerning the troops

NKW YORK. August 12.?Despite
the night-and-dny Tight against It.
the plague of infantile paralysis grew
stronger to-day. The department of
health reported 107 new cases, against
1<55 for Friday. There were forty
two deaths, as against thirty-one the
day before.
The eternal optimism and the steady
J combat of the surgeons is unflagging.
but there is a growing fear that the
| disease will have to run its course?
i "burn itself out." as one doctor put
| it. As the surgeons are still in a
fog regarding the cause and the
, genesis of the malady, they are at a
' lo.?s to explain the daily fluctuations
! of the figures. And they are still
j groping for a standard cure and a
| standard weapon with which to fight
the advance.
One thing alone i.s certain: slowly,
but surely, it Is gathering force and
felling victims. The figures show that
since August 1 it has overtaken a
greater number of persons than in all
the plague weeks preceding. Like
| wise, the deaths have been more
; numerous. Total figures for August
j are: deaths, 254; cases. 998. Total
| figures for the epidemic: deaths. 1,371;
cases, fi.1-10.
Commissioner Emmerson to-day ap
pealed to the United States Depart
ment of Health to secure the release
of twelve Canadian nurses who are
being detained by the Immigration of
ficials at Montreal. The young wo
men are graduates of American in
stitutions, and were on their way to
New York to help in the Infantile
paralysis fight. The immigration of
ficials, however, deemed this to be a
violation of the alien labor law, and
refused to permit them to enter this
country.

SAN FRANCISCO, August 12.?The
American government may go into
vaudeville to spread the doctrine of
preparedness and get recruits for the
army. Nine regular soldiers in com
mand of a sergeant appeared at a local
theater yesterday in a skit, "The Out
post," and went through setting-up
oxercises anrl drills, and at the con
clusion of a plot, saved the flag from
falling Into the hands of the enemy.
At the army recruiting headquarters
In San Francisco it was said that if

Predicted That Such an Agree

To-Day.
MEDIATION EFFORTS' FAIL
President Wilson Is Ready to
Intervene Should It Be
come Necessary.
NEW YORK. August 12.?Notwith
standing the failure of mediation to
bring together the representatives of
the railroads of the country and their
400.000 employees on the demand for
an elght-iour day and time and a half
overtime, the threatened strike that
would tie up 2:..> railroad systems and
throw 1.$00,000 railroad workers out of
employment may tie averted by arbi
tration
An agreement to this effect may be
entered Into to-morrow, It was pre
dicted hero to-night.
At the end of a day of confusing
situations and contradictory reports,
the leaders of the four railroad brother
hoods and the members of the United
States Board of Mediation and Con
ciliation. which is striving to effect a
peaceful settlement at the special re
! quest of President Wilson, viewed the
| situation optimistically.
. a finitr atio.v r\DEn
PnESEXT ACT IXSATIfiEAf TOnr
It virtually has been conceded that
arbitration under the present pro
visions of the Newlands act would not
be satisfactory to the men. but an ex
pansion of the board provided for may
be accepted by them with the proviso
that only their present demands are
to be arbitrated. The railroads have
maintained that in the event of arbi
tration, not only the demands of their
employees, but the roads' "contingent
proposition." tvhi<-h Is based on the
eight-hour day, but eliminates the
; double compensation features, should
j be arbitrated.
i Several time? during th< day's nego
tiations between the mediators and the
I trainmen it seemed as if the men were
! on the point of withdrawing from fur
ther parley. when the situation
reached a point where it was reported
J President \\ ilson had intervened, A. |
? B. Oarrc-tson. president of the Order!
of Railway Conductors, authorized a,
j statement which clearly indicated that I
I the brotherhoods would not oppose I
j such action
"An invitation from the President
of the United States," said Mr. Oar- !
retson. Is tantamount to a command. !
If he summons us to Washington we
u K0, but it must be understood
that the President has no more power
in this matter than the mediators."
i Although the mediators and the
railroad managers refused to discuss
j the events of the day. Mr. Oarretson
, had no hesitation in doinK so, saying
that mediation having failed, he was
under no further ohlipatlon to main- j
i tain secrecy about the negotiations.
I He snid the double-compensation fea- {
i Hire was the stumbling block.
Mr. Oarretson declared that double- !
compesation agreements are in effect '
| on virtually every railroad in the!
i country, and they were won by the !
men after serious effort extending over
a period of thirty years.
MEDIATORS WII.I, RRPOIIT
A<;.\ IX THIS MOHM.VG
Because the mediators could not Rive
l the trainmen assurance that the rail
' roads would waive the "contingent
i proposition.' the- men adjourned until 1
| to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock, when 1
j the mediators acaln will report. The j
j mediators met the railroad managers
only for a brief period during the
| afternoon, hut said they had satisfac
I tory sessions with both sides A high
' railroad official declared, however, that
there would be no backdown on their
part until the other side showed a
disposition to meet them half way.
The next move is up to the rail
roads. Mr. Oarretson said. In view of
the fact that they had requested the
services of the mediators.
PRESIDENT MAY SEEK
PERSftXAIi t.'O.VFEREXCES ;
WASHIXOTOX, August 12?Per- '
sonal conferences will be sought by j
President Wilson with representatives
of the railroads and their employees
if all other efforts fall to avert the
threatened strike of the four great
railroad union brotherhoods. He is
seriously considering making a trip
to New York for the purpose.
The President talked over the long
distance telephone to-day with mem
bers of the Federal Board of Mediation
and Counciiiation In New York, and
told litem that if they were unable to
bring about an igrvement and a ">real.
seemed imminent, he was to be n.->tlt!;i
immediately. He hopes It will not be
recess.Vrv. but as a last resort he
desires personally to urge upon the
parties to the controversy the
trous efiWt upon themselves an I upon
the country which would follow tying
up railroads by a strike.
Although the President was told
early in the day that the situation w.vs
critical, word erne to-night that ,?-cs
pects for an '?greement were more
favorable and that further conferences
would he held in New York to-morraw.
Mr. Wilson remained in his ortl.io at
the White House throughout thi dav
In order to keep In close touch with
the situation. He has taken no stand
on the merits of the arguments ? pre
sented by either side, but is understood
to believe that there must be some
common ground on which the employ
ers and employees can meet.
During the day the President receiv
ed a petition from representatives of
unorganized railroad employees, urg
ing that Congress pass legislation
which would prevent the railroads be
ing paralyzed by a strike of the mem
bers of the brotherhoods, who, it Is
claimed, represent only 20 per cent of
the employees. The first petition con
tained 6,000 names, and it was said
that other larger petitions would come
within the next few days.

tain Lesklvit, of the French armored
cruiser. Amlral Aubc, which arrived
here this afternoon, denied street ru
mors. which were credited to one of his
orderlies, to the effect that the Amlral
Aube had received a wireless message
on Tuesday from a British patrol-boat
on the Atlantic coast, stating that the
patrol boat had sunk the (ierman mer
chant submarine Deutschland on Aug
ust 8. The captain asserted that he
had received no information whatever
that the Deutschland had been sunk
and that all such reports were abso
lutely false.
Westerby Howe, consular agent of
France, at this port, also declared there
was no truth in the reports that the
Amlral Aube had received any wireless
message stating the Deutschland had
been sunk and an investigation to
night revealed that the report was
merely a street rumor which was at
tributed to an unnamed orderly of the
Amiral Aube.

II V MA II INF OilStell VKits
NORFOLK, August 12.?Marine ob
servers here to-night doubted that a
British patrol-boat had sunk the Ger
man merchant submarine Deutschland,
as reported by the captain's orderly of
th? French cruiser Amiral Aube at
Pensacola. They pointed out that on
August 8 the undersea boat was six
days on her return Journey to Germany,
and that, unless there had been ma
chinery troubles, she would have been
far out in the Atlantic on that date.
These observers also pointed to the
fact that the Deutschland could sub
merge in one minute's time, making 1*
extremely difficult, they said, for a
warship to attack her. They also con
tend that an allied warship could not
have followed the submarine for any
length of time at night without the
use of a searchlight, and '~iat such a
light would have disclosed the war
ship's presence to the Deutschland's
crew and enabled her to escape.
Nothing has been heard here from
the Deutschland since she was last seen
submerging one mile off Cape Henry
on the night of August 2.
That she eluded the enemy patrol
cfl' the capes there was little doubt, as
some allied warships were seen off the
coast the next day. Observers say that
in all probability allied cruisers set out
to search for the submersible when
they learned she had successfully
passed the blockade, but they said that
finding her would be difficult, as she
undoubtedly did not follow the beaten
lanes of transatlantic traffic.

administration for what he called fail

notably the plank declaring for the
maintenance of American rights
abroad.
"This administration, in the first in

He reiterated his declaration that he
was against "pork barrel methods,

Mr. Hughes left here, at 7:35 P. M.

Reviewing the first week of his
campaign, the nominee issued a state
ment saying that he was much grntl- ^

[Special to The Times-Dispatch.]
BRISTOL. VA? August 12.?IS. Lee
Trlnkle, of Wythevllle. prominent as
a lawyer and a man of financial and
business influence, will lead the de
mocracy of the Ninth Virginia Dis
trict in the. fight this fall. This after
noon he was unanimously nominated
for Congress at one of the largest and
most demonstrative conventions in the
history of the party. The large num
ber of delegates made it necessary to
go from the city hall to the new
school auditorium, since the latter
seats 1.200 comfortably. The audi
torium was filled almost to capacity,
each county being represented by a
large delegation of Influential men.
After it. had been determined by
roll call that no county in the dis
trict had a candidate to offer, the con- j
vention. upon motion of Judge Fulton. I
of w ythe County, voted to name a \
committee, to be composed^ of on? man !
from each county, to find and recom- j
mend a man who would be willing to 1
answer the call of his party. This '
committee was headed by Governor ?
Henry C. Stuart, who represented Rus
sell County. Governor Stuart, acting
kas spokesman for the committee,
placed Mr. Trinkle's name before the
convention. He declared that with
Mr. Trlnkle as the nominee, aided hy
the splendid record made by the Wil
son administration, the party should
win. His mention of the name of Mr.
Trlnkle aroused wild enthusiasm. The
delegates rose and, amid shouts and
yells, hats and handkerchiefs were
tossed Into the air. The demonstra
tion was kept up for somo minutes,
and was renewed after the unanimous
vote of the convention had been
recorded.
i-oi'DLY applauded
AS HE TAKES STAND
R. Tate Irvine, permanent chairman
of the convention, named Governor
Stuart, General R. A. Ayers and Judge
John W. Price as a committee to noti
fy Mr. Trlnkle of his nomination and
escort him to the stand. There was
loud and prolonged applause as Mr.
, Trlnkle marched down one of the
aisles to take his place on the stand.
Mr. Trlnkle accepted the nomination
in an earnest speech. In which he
assured the delegates that he had done
everything possible to avoid the nomi
nation, but that he could not decline
to respond to the unanimous call of his
party, especially In a yenr like this,
when the Democratic party, instead of
struggling to show wh It can do. is!
before the people on a record of splen-|
did achievement, with a leader like j
"Woodrow Wilson, who. h?? said, is next '
to Jefferson in point of unsullied prip- !
ciples and unwavering purpose. He
pleaded -with the delegates to get bo- j
hind him with all earnestness.
"I want you." he said with earnest- |
ness, "to get behind me as your stand- j
ard bearer in the district and help me
to win this fight. I want you to tell
everybody you meet that Lee Trinkle
made no mistake; that he believes he
is going to he elected, and that you
believe It, too. We can, and must,
win, but It will only be by your com
plete co-operation and active efforts."
Many voices were heard pledging
support, and the nominee concluded his
speech of acceptance amid tumultuous
applause.
, The convention was opened at 10
o'clock this mornins. Herbert G. Pe
ters, of Bristol, was temporary chair
man, while C. S. Carter, of Scott County,
was elected temporary secretary. Mr.
Peters delivered the keynote speech of
the occasion. He aroused great en
thusiasm by his discussion of the rea
sons why the democracy should ex
pect victory in the district this fall.
He alluded to Wilson as one of Amer
ica's greatest trio of men, referring
to Washington and Jefferson as the
other two. He emphasized that the
Democrats go before the country upon
a record which cannot fail to win.
"The Wilson administration," he de
clared,'"Is the most potential in history
from the standpoint of achievements.
For constructive legislation it has
no equal In half a century." j,

JOHNSTOWN*. PA.. August 12.?
Twenty-five persons, including nine
women and four children, were killed
and sixty-three wounded In a head-on
collision between two crowded trolley
cars on the line of the Southern Cam
bria Traction Company, between Echo
and Brookvale. seven miles from here,
to-day. Fourteen were instantly killed,
while eleven others died after being
removed from the wreckage. Several
more arc in a <citieal condition and
probably will die.
The cause of the accident has not
been determined, but Coroner Fitzger
ald has started an investigation. The
company, in a statement to-night, said
it was, absolutely without data on
which to base a report as to how the
accident occurred.
According to persons in the vicinity
.at the time of the wreck, one car was
standing still near the car barn at
Echo, when the other car crashed down j
a steep grade and into it.
Shortly before the accident the rent
ear vas seen to rush past the station
at Brookvale. with the motorman fran
tically waving his arms. Believing the
car was not under control, the cur
rent was shut off at the. power plant,
but this action was taken too late to
avoid a crash.
A majority of the victims were mem

WASHINGTON, August 12.?Secretary
Daniels to-day promised Clarence J.
Owens. managing director of the
Southern Commercial Congress, to as
semble two or three naval divisions,
and possibly the entire Atlantic Fleet.
In Hampton Roads during the annual I
meeting of the congress at Norfolk,
December 11 to 14. A naval parade
and display may be arranged also. Sec
retary Daniels will address the con
press.
Mr. Daniels declared that most ships j
in the Atlantic Fleet ordinarily would;
put into the roads for the Christ mas I
holiday, and it probably would be easy
for them to gather there a little earlier, j
In addition to affording a spectacle for j
those attending the Commercial Con
press meeting, it is pointed out, a naval
display would be of interest to the en
tire country.
Secretary Daniels will discuss plans
for the Meet assembly with Rear
Admiral Iienson. chief <>f the Bureau of
N'aval Operations, early next week.
Mr. Daniels stated that at least ten
[>r twelve vessels of the first class proh
ibly would bo available for the naval
nssembly, together with a greater num
ber of minor craft. A gathering of the
Bntlre fleet would bring together twice
that number. The last parade of the)
Atlantic Fleet was in New York on
May 1". when President Wilson re-j
