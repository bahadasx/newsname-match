1NDIANOLA TAKES THE FINAL
GAME BY A SCORE OF
1 TO 0.
The baseball season in Columbus
came to a close yesterday afternoon,
the final game of a scries with In
dianola having resulted in the score
of 1 to 0 in favor of the visitors. The
local team disbanded last night,
owing ot the fact that the support on
the part of local fans has not been
the best, and Mr. E L. Kuykendall,
president of the team here, thought
it advisable to bring the season to a
close.
In the game yesterday afternoon
Harris, on the local firing line,
struck out nine men, and although
he allowed only three hits, the vis
itors succeeded in making a run in
the second inning. Ridley, who
pitched for Indianola, allowed only
five hits.
Score: R- H. E.

Columbus and Indianola crossed
bats at Lake Park Friday afternoon
and the visitors won the game by a
score of 8 to 1. Roberts pitched for
Columbus and Suggs was on the fir
ine line for Indianola, and each al
lowed an equal number of hits, but
errors in the field at inopportune
times were responsible for the de
feat of the locals. There was a large
crowd present and rooters cheered
vociferously at several brilliant plays
made by the Columbians. Among the
features most worthy of favorable
comment were tfl fielding and hit
ting of Shaw', who plays left field
, for Stapleton's aggregation. All In
dianolians swatted effectively, sev
eral three-baggers having been made
by members of the team.

LEMBERG IS SERIOUSLY MEN
ACED BY THE RUSSIAN
ADVANCE.
London, Aug. I'.'.A further
series of surprising uv-esse.- by the
armies of Gens. SakUn-off . d Let-
chitzaky v.ere announced trUay by
the capture of the important railway
junction and town of Stainslau, the
definite occupation of Monasterys-1
ka and the seizure of important po-
sitions on .the Zlota Lipa line. Cou
pled witV these victories was the cap
ture of many thousands of prisoners,
especially on the right bank of the
Sereth river, where the prisoners
taken amounted to 5,000;
The Germans appeared to regard
the Kovel-Lemberg sector as the
most critical on the eastern front,
and the appointment of Field Mar
shall von Ilindenberg to the chief in
command undoubtedly had the effect
of temporarily stemming the Rus
sian advance on the northern sector
of the line. But Field Marshall von
Ilindenberg does not hold the con
trolling command over the troops
guarding the southern approaches to
Lemberg, where the Russians, after
taking Stanislau, are rapidly com
pleting their encirclement of the ar
my of Genj Count von Bothmer.
The German official statement to
day admitted that a regrouping of
the Teutonic forces was taking place
in order to meet the new positions of
the Russian army,.
The Italians continue their suc
cesses aguinst the Austrians and an
nounced today the occupation of the
entire Doberdo plateau.
Nothing sensational is happening
on the Franco-British front, where
the entente allies are maintaining a
steady pressure. Although the Brit
ish fdVces have shown little activity
north of the Somme, the French re
port the capture of additional Ger
man trenches near Maupas and a
fortified quarry north of the Hem
wood.
Boy Scout in Camp.
Sixteen members of the local
troop of Boy Scouts left Friday for

Washington, Aug. 12. Plans were
completed today by the war depart -
ment for the complete mobilization
of the aircraft to make the army
aero service superior if possible to!
any in the world. In brief the plan
is this: Government inspectors will
be stationed at each plant in the
country, and the government stamp
will be placed on each machine put
up. The prospective flyers will
be passed on by the government be

ONLY HOPE TO EVADE
IT LIES IN SELECTION
OF LARGER BODY.
NEITHER SIDH IS
WILLING TO YIELD
Brotherhoods Object to Pro
visions of Newlands Act, and
Want Some Other Plan.
New York. Aug. 12. Whether the
leaders of the 400,000 employes of
the railroads of the country will
make (rood their threat of a general
slnke unless their demands for an
eiht hour day and time and a half
for overtime are granted by the
managers of 215 railway systems, is
still undecided.
The only hope of a peaceful set
tlement apparently rested upon the
possibility that the men might be
induced to accept a new form of ar
bitration, although thus far they
have steadfastly refused all ' such
proposals. Thcif chief objection to
arbitration has been lack of repre
sentation upon any of the boards
provided under existing statutes.
The members of the federal board
of mediation and conciliation are
said to be hopeful that an expansion
of the size of the board provided for
under the Newlands act may meet
their objection. Effort to obtain
from Washington approval of this
plan was reported to have been ie
uponsible for n apparent suspension
of the mediators' activities today.
If this suggestion is not accepted,
it was said, the mediation board will
have failed in its efforts and the
only recourse will be an appeal to
President Wilson to use his influ
ence to avert a stiike. It was point
iUt, huioevijr, that the Pit'uidotHV
powers will be limited to nuggest'ion
and recommendation.
The three mediator!- Chsiirnvw
Martin A. Knupp, William L ('hum
bers and G. W. Hangar were to
meet with the brotherhood men ear
ly Friday, but an adjournment was
taken until Saturday. The mediators
also failed to meet the railroad man
agers. Leaders of the brotherhoods have
declared that they would not consid
er arbitration under the Newlands
act, as it now stands. The railroad
have rejected the men's demands and
have Ktood out firmly for arbitra
tion. The nu-n have served notice
that rather than arbitrate they will
strike.
With both sides taking su-h an
unbending attitude there is no solu
tion to the problem except the new
arbitration plan, according to a re
sponsible authority.
The principal feature of the new
plan is said to be the formation of
a bourd of arbitration, which will
give each of the brotherhoods a rep
resentative on the board while the
arbitrators of the railroads will be
ncieased to an equal number with
four neutral arbitrators, making a
total membership of 12.

CAUSES ANNULMENT
Farmers are Badly Behind
With Work, and Could III
Afford to Leave Fields.
Responding to a petition present
ed to him by the Columbus Bar As
sociation, Hon. T. B. Carroll, judge
of the Sixteenth circuit court dis
trict, has issued an order pretermit
ting the fall term of circuit court for
Lowndes county, which, under the
provisions of the code, ise sched
uled in this city on the second Man-
day in September.
In requesting Jude Carroll to pre
termit the term local attorneys were
actuated by a desire to protect the
agricultural intercuts of the county.
Farmers have been materially hin-
lered by the heavy rains which fell
throughout this section in July, and
are therefore very much behind with
their work. To have forced them to
leave the fields just at a time when
crops will be about ready for har
vest, would have worked an unnec
essary hardship upon them, and, real
izing this fact, members of the bar
requested that the September court
term be pretermitted.
The docket is rather light, and
few, if any litigants will be discom
moted or inconvenienced by the pre
termission of the term.

to nominate supreme court judges
and congressmen, and clerks and

There are to be nominated in this

three aspirants, Hon. E. O. Sykes, of
Aberdeen, who is now on the bench,
Hon. J. G. McGowen, of Water Val
ley, and Hon. R. II. Knox, of Hous
ton. While Mr. Candler has made no
cunvass it is generally believed he
w li be nominated, as the fact that he
has remained at his post in Washing

constituents and shows that he is
worthy of their support.
