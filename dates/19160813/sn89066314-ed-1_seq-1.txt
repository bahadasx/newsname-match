NO FEAR OF TYPHOID,
SAY LOCJUOCTORS
Physicians Say That Most of
New Cases Are From
Out of Tow n.
CITY WATER IS SAKE
Board of Health Tests Show
Small Ihcteria and No
Pollution.
That there is no typhoid epidemic
in Columbia and that there is no dan
ger of anyone contracting typhoid
from drinking the City water was the
.statement yesterday by Columbia
phsicians and members of the city
health deiart:nent and other city of
ficials. A thorough examination has
been conducted by the city authori
ties and though the water tested was
taken from an end main a main
where the water remains for some
time and the place where germs are
most apt to lie found there was no
sign of typhoid.
"There is no epidemic of typhoid
fever in Columbia, and there is no
cause for alarm," said .Mayor I!at
tcrton last night. "The cases of ty
phoid in this city are of no -greater
number than those in other towns of
the same size, and the majority of the
cases that are reported here come
from somewhere else. We have just
made a careful examination of the
water, and an investigation of every
thing that could produce typhoid, and
there is absolutely no cause for
alarm. The people should take a
sane view of this matter. It is nat
ural that there will be a few cases of
typhoid at this time of year."
Hoard of Health .Meets.
The board of health met Friday af
ternoon in the ollice of the president.
Dr. W. R. Shaefer, to consider the
matter of typhoid fever. The meeting
was called because of the recent
alarm as to the condition of the city
water.
I)r. M. I Ravenel made a report on
the City water, lie said: "A sample
of the City water from the tap at
1001 Locust street on June SO. l'Jlfi.
showed a rather high bacterial count,
but no evidence of sewage pollution.
The water appeared entirely safo "jr
drinking purposes. Another sample
of the city water from 70S Providence
road on August S, 1K1G, showed only
a moderate bacterial count and no
evidence of sewage polulion. The
water is entirely safe. I have made
nnalvses of the city water every few
days since last September and I have I
never found any cause for alarm.
Because of the many rumors that
the city water was not pure and that
Columbia was in danger of a typhoid
..I
mddemic. the Missourian yesturuay
sent a reporter to every physician in
Columbia. Their statements are .giv
en below. Those who are not quoted
were cither out of town or were at
tending some patient and could not
be seen.
What the Doctors Say.
IIP. V. K. Shaefer said: "There is
absolutely no fear from the water. I
have been here for several years and
there is no more typhoid than is the
usual case. I have had very few
cases and the greater part of these
arc from out of the city."
r. W. A. Norris said: '"I have had
no cases of typhoid. There seemed to
be some cases of the disease in the
county but there is as much in other
places not so large as Columbia. The
water is in good shape and there
should be no alarm."
Ilr. J. K. Thornton said: "There is
no epidemic, and the water used by
this town is as" good as that used
anywhere. There is very little ty
phoid in Columbia."
Ir. A. Vi. Knmpsehiiildt said:
"There is no cause for the talk that
is being made around the city in re
gard to typhoid. I have found but
little typhoid no more than would
anneal-"in any town of this size at
this time of year." '
llr. W. E. Rclden said: "There may
be a. possibility, but not a probability
of a typhoid epidemic. There is no
danger from the water supply. Peo
ple may contract the disease from
outside and bring it in here where it
might spread because of personal
unsanitary conditions. The chances
are slight though."
Ilr. 0. A. Moore said: "I have no
tvphoid cases. I do not think there
is any possibility of an epidemic. The
sanitary conditions of the town are
all right."

COUNCIL WILL VOTE
ON A NEW FIRE CAR
Question of New Chief's Ma
chine Will Soon Come
Up for Decision.
DEADLOCK POSSIBLE
2 Members For New Equip
ment, 3 Against and 1
Remains Silent.
The agitation on foot for the city
to purchase some kind of a car for
the use of Fire Chief Earl Kurtz will
probably materialize in the matter
being brought to the attention of the
city council at the next meeting of
that body.
Some months ago a car with a
chemical attachment, costing $2,000,
was brought here for trial. The coun
cil voted down the purchase of the
car. It was sent back to the manu
facturers. Several of the councilmcn
who were opposed to the purchase of
the former car now have expressed
themselves as being in favor of equip
ping the department with a smaller
machine at a cost of about $500.
Kurtz Sujs Car Is Xccessary.
It is Chief Kurtz's contention that
an additional car is necessary both for
the performance of his duties as chief
and for the protection of city prop
erty from fires that the present truck
would be unable to handle. He says
that if equipped with some means of
rapid conveyance he could go out to I
inspect flues, investigate buildings
highly susceptible to fire and attend
to other duties that take him away
from the station without having to
leave the department a long period of
time.
How could I be expected to get to
a fire," said Mo Kurtz yesterday, ir
I were out in one part of the town on
inspection work, as I often am, and
an alarm should be turned into the
department from another section of
the city? It would mean that I could
not be on the job unless I were lucky
enough to catch a ride.
"To me purchase of an additional
car has come down to these alterna
tives: I must either sacrifice my ob
ligation to the department and to the
town and get to the fires from my
home as best I can, or I must deprive
myself from being with my family day
and night except at meal times. The
big truck that we now have cannot
continue in good running order for
ever.
Cites an Example.
"Take as an example the Colum
bia Feed and Grain Company fire the
other night. Although only four
blocks away, suppose that something
should have happened to the car on
the way. At that time of the night
there would have been no possible
way to have moved the truck to the
scene of action. There is the ad
vantage of an auxiliary car."
The members of the council when
interviewed yesterday afternoon by a
Missourian reporter appeared to be
about evenly divided upon the issue.
Two or three of the members are op
posed to the purchase of a machine
for the chief on the grounds that the
city needs other improvements worse.
Others, while favoring such a pur
chase, are not willing to dip into the
city treasury to any great extent.
These men contend that if a machine
can be purchased for something like
$400 or $500 the Investment would bo
highly necessary and that in such in
stance the city could equip the car
with a chemical tank, which appears
to be the most potent expense factor,
at whatever time it feels financially
able.
The Mayor Is Silent.
"T it. Intrini. n nfif-l In the ntri(a -
tion for the buying of this car for

Eighteen Cases Reported
One Death Water Is
Found to Be OK.
Approximately twelve persons in
McBaine are stricken with typhoid,
according to reports received from
there last night. One person, Miss
Alice Grindstaff, died yesterday morn
ing from typhoid and several more
! nave bccn sent t0 the hospital.
Dr. F. C. Williamson of McBaine
told the Missourian over long dis
tance telephone last night that there
have been eighteen cases of typhoid
in McBaine recently and that the
source of infection had not been
found.
"We had our water analyzed," said
Doctor Williamson. "The reports
showed that it is exceptionally fine
for drinking purposes. As the num
ber of cases increased, I took up the
matter personally and had another
analysis made. The result was the
same that our water could not be bet
ter. "We cannot deny the fact that there
is an epidemic of typhoid here. There
were as many as eighteen cases. One
person died and several have been
sent to the hospital, so there are
now about twelve cases here.
"In one house three persons were
stricken almost simultaneously. One
person caught the disease and the
others probably took it from him.
We have made every effort, but arc
still unable to find the source of the
infection."
.Miss Alice Grindstaff Dies.
Miss Alice Grindstaff, 35 .years old,
died last night of typhoid fever at
