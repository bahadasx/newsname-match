standing the failure of mediation to i
bring together the representatives of
the railroads of the country and their
400,000 employes on the demand for
an eight-hour day and time ard a
half for overtime, the threatened
strike that would tie up 225 rpilroad
systems and throw 1,800,000 railway
workers out of employmetn, tnay he
averted by arbitration.
An agreement to this effect nay be
entered into tomorrow, it was pre
dicted here today. At the end of 8
day of confusing situations and con-;
tradictory reports, the leaders of the ,
four railroad brotherhoods and the
members of the United States board
of mediation and conciliation, which
is striving to effect a peaceful settle
ment at the special reuest of Presi
dent Wilson, viewed the situation op
timistically. It has been virtually conceded that
arbitration under the present provi
sions of the Newlands ate would not
be satisfactory to the men, but an ex
pansion of the board provided for
may be accepted by them with the
proviso that only their present de
mands are to be arbitrated. The rail
ways have maintained that in the
ovent of arbitration, not only the de
mands of their employes but the
roads "contingent proDosition" which
is based on the eiehthour day but
eliminates the double compensation
features, should be arbitrated.
Several times during the day's nego
tiations between the mediators and
the trainmen it seemed as if the men
were on the point of withdrawing
from furthr psrlev.
When the situation reached a point
where Pres:dent Wilson had inter
vened, Mr. Win. Garretson, president
of the order of railroad conductors.
authorized a statement which clear-
ly Indicated the brotherhoods would
not oppose such action.
An invitation of the president of
the United States, said Mr. Garret
son, is tantamount to a command. If
he summons us to Washineton we
will go. But it must bo understood thot
th president has no more power in j
this matter than the mediators."
The next move is un to the rail-!
roads. Mr. Garretson said, in view of.
the fact that they had reuested the ,
services of the mediators. I

EL PASO, Aug. 12. An undercur-
rent of unrest is manifesting itself In
various cities in Chihuahua, accord
ing to reports here tonight. These re
ports emanating from several appar
ently reliable sources, indicated that
there has been no concerted move
ment anywbre in the state to over
throw the defacto 0.vern:nent. but !
that numbers of agitators apparently
tinder no centra! organization, have '
been attempting to foment revolu- !
tions.
Embroil Many Cities.
The revolutinary plots, which ap
parently have been developed within
the last few weeks have centered in
Chihuahua City and Juarez, although
according to private dispatches, per-
sons charged with being connected
with revolutionary cabals have been
taken into custody in Parral, Jimenez
and other of the small cities.
Leading Men Arrested.
In the state capital upward of one
hundred men of prominence, all of
whom have been connected with the
Vilia, the Madero, the Orozco and oth
ers of the various political factions,
have been arrested on a charge of at
tempting to seize the city, and are
i now awaiting trial for treason.
In Juarez today orders were issued
that all persons in that Mexican town
across the border, other than the mili
tary, the customs and municipal au-
inoruies, must surrender the.r arms
before 8 o'clock tonight, because of the j
presence of persons attempting to in
cite revolt. Hundreds of weapons
were collected.
It was generally belkved tonight, j
that the 1,100 troops recently brought
to Juarez and the recent arrival there i
of General Gabriel Gavira .inspector i
I general of the Carranza army, and
General Jose Gutierrez, military dire- I
I tor of the Mexican national railways,
i was a result of the various rebellious
, plots and counter plots recently un-
' earthed.
