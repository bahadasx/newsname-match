Secretary Maker also made public
a letter to a correspondent whose
name was not disclosed and who had
suKKcsted that the poverninent
should discharge state soldiers do
sirinK to return to their business
cares. The secretary wrote:
"A call to arms upon any body of
men In the country, except the reg
ular army, who make a profession
of the military life, would inevitably
Interrupt business, professional and
personal careers, and it Is impossible
to imagine any situation in which
the organized militia and national
guard of the several states could be
summoned into the federal service
without hardship and inconvenience,
and yet both the constitution of the
1'nited States and the laws made
pursuant thereto recogmz.e these
rnilitia Hnd national guard units as
the secondary reliance of the gov
ernment for the protection of the
Interests of the United States and
the lives of the citizens of the coun
try. "The department regrets these In
conveniences and hopes that the
t'tnergency will rapidly disappear
and that there will be such a restora
tion of order and security ,on the
frontier as will permit the speedy
return of these citizen soldiers to
their several civilian pursuits. In
the meantime this department has
taken steps to militate and relieve
as far as possible the unusual nnd
exceptional hardships which have
arisen In classes especially subject
to distress by reason of the services
demanded. To the extent that that
can be done in fact, it will be done,
but the primary consideration must
be the safety of our border and the
preservation and protection of the
lives of our citizens there.
"It will be a source of great hap
piness to me when full relief can be
given to these men who have placed
themselves subject to this call of
duty, and In the meantime I am
filled with admiration for the spirit
With which the militia has met the
call, and with which they are per
forming an Important and necessary
service to their country at this time."

efforts will be made by the state to
augment the amount and make it big
enough to do some real good. It is
Mr. Cunningham's belief that It will
be six months before this money can

A AISTKIt 1 1. M, Aug. 12. -A tele
ga in from Dinlapesi says that Count

Jliiiiearian ehainr.er of depuiiy, as
seitcd it v. n:,;. he in the interests of
1 race if the government would make
a ooclaratioii in leg i id to the war
aims of the monarchy and the condi
tions demanded for terminati'ig I lie
struggle.
AlOouth he desired .1 speedy peace,
he wished it to be a lasting one.
Referring to Rumania and the as
pirations supposed to be cherished
thin for possession of Tr'.n.'iylvunia,
tl.r count said:
"So long rs a 1 1 inisraiian breathes
we shall fight unswer im-ly for the
Integrity of Hungary and tho deftnse
of Trunsylv inla."
Would .Strengthen llianoe.
Count Albert Apponyi, leidcr of the
opposition, who has ai'cjpted the pro
gram of Court Karolyi, said he saw
the best gucranteo of lasting peace In
the strengthening of the monarchy's
a 1 1 lances.
Premier Tiszu said in reply he de
sired only to stute, as was known,
that a noisy section of the Rumanian
press has done everything possible,
since the beginning of the war to
involve Rumania in war with Austria
Hungary. The premier added that
tho ridiculous calumny that Count
Karolyi desired peace at any price
and a separate peace with Russia hud
made a certain impression on Ruman
ian public opinion and on the entente
powers, lie declared emphatically
his agreement with Count Karolyi's
view that as long as a Hungarian was
left alive the Hungarian nation would
resist to the utmost any attack upon
its integrity.
Must Dcrcml Inlcgrily.
"I do not speak here of Rumania,
where today we confront the hostile
tendency of irresponsible elements,"
he continued. "I speak of our enemies
and of tho fact that we must wage
war further If we wish to defend our
integrity, for this war is directed
against our integrity.
"It is openly avowed that the par
tition of the monarchy, and especially
of the Hungarian state, is the object
aimed at. As long as we face such
a situation we shall not speak in this
house of peace, but of victory.
"Kvrrybody knows we did not be
gin this war. The whole watrld knows
that even in the days before the
declaration of war and since then,
during the course of the war, we have
always been ready for honorable
peace. The task for the present mo
ment is to make every exertion for
victory."

Here Is AU That Has

Tulsa, Aug. 10. Dear Editor: Some
time ago 1 noticed an article in The
World regarding the Tulsa laundries.
I want to commend you on the good
work you are doing. I feel sure il is
appreciated by the people of Tulsa and
if The World can expose and throw
the light of publicity on their methods'
it will be an incentalive lor some real
laundry concern to locate here and
give the people a square deal.
In my own case I have had such
experience as having silk shirt cuffs
starched stiff, thereby causing the silk
to crack. I have had children's cloth
ing returned to me in exchange for
men s clothes and when I have re
turned the children's clothes and de
manded my own in return I have been
ignored.
I would suggest The World take the
mutter up and get some commissioner
lo Investigate the conditions. Tulsa is
getting too big to stand for that class
of stuff. The people are with you. Go
after them. Yours truly, A Subscriber.

The president talked over the

Willi loeml.i i of the federal
hoard ot iiie.liiit ion and concilia
tion in New Votk and told iheni
if Ihey were unable to bring
about an agreement and a break
seemed imminent he was to be
notified immediately. As s last
resort lie ib-sircs personally to
urge upon Ihc parties to ihe con
troversy the disastrous effects
upon themselves and upon the
country which would follow ty
ing up 22a railroads by a strike.
Although the president was
told early in the day that the
situation was critical, word
came tonight that prospects for
an agreement waue more favor
able and that further confer
ences would he held in New
York tomorrow.
NKW YORK. Aug. 12. -Notwithstanding
the failure of media
lion to bring together the representa
tives of the railroads of the country
und their four hundred thousand em
ployes on the demand for an eight
hour d.ty and time and u half over
time, the threatened strike that would
tie up 22a railroad systems and throw
1,800,000 railroad workers out of em
ployment, may be averted by arbitra
tion. An agreement to this effect may
lie entered Into tomorrow, it was pre
dicted here tonight.
At the end of i day of confusing
situations and contradictory reports,
the leaders of the four railroad broth
erhoods and the members of the
1'nited States board of mediation and
conciliation, which is striving to ef
fect a peaceful settlement at tho spe
cial rciiest of President Wilson,
viewed the situation optimistically.
It has been virtually conceded thai
arbitration under the present provis
ions of the New lands act would not
be satisfactory to the men, but an
expansion of the board provided for
may be accepted by tnein with the
provision that onl their present de
mands are lo Is- arbitrated. The rail
roads have maintained that in the
event of arbitration, not only Ihc de
mands of their employes, hilt the
roads contingent proposition which is
liastd on the eight -hour day but
eliminates the double compensation
features, should lie arhitraltd.
Kef use to Discuss.
Although the mediators and the
railroad managers refused to discuss
the events of the day, Mr. (iarretson
had no hesitation in doing so, bay
ing that mediation having failed, he
was under no further obligations lo
maintain s. erc-v about the negotia
tions. He said the double compensa
tion feature was the stumbling block.
Mr. (jarret.son declared double com
pensation u'crecincnts arc In effect on
virtually very railroad in the country
and that they wire won by the men
bfter serious effort extending over a
1 1 riod of thirty yours. De.auso the
mediulors could not give the train
men assurances that the railroads
would waive "Ihe contingent proposi
tion," the men adjourned until to
mi'iTow morning at 10 o'cloi k when
the medial-. r. will r.gain report. The
mediators met the railroad managers
oily tor a blief period during ttie aft
ernoon, but said they had satisfactory
r-essions with both sides. A high
railrtu.l official leclared. however,
that there would be no backdown on
tl.iir part until the oth-r side showed
a disposition to meet thoni half wav.
The next move is up to the rall
rti'ds. Mr. (Iarretson suld, in view of
thi fact that they h:d requested the
ren ices of the mediators.
