means of reaching a settlement." .
Immediately they were handed ,

percent vote to call a atrike. If, la,
their opinion, such action is essen

waa believed In railroad and brother

This seriousness was emphasised
by the statement of a prominent re

road would face a strike rather than
give up their plan to settle alKdlf
