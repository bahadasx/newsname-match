NEW YORK, Aug. 13. With the receipt of initial reports from
various sections of the country at the offices of the Republican
national committee the horizon looms bright with prospects for ghe
election of Charles Evans Hughes and Charles Warren Fairbanks
Already claims are made that the Republican ticket will be
carried into office by between 300 and 325 electoral votes.
This prediction is from no other source than the secretary to
Chairman Willcox, of the Republican committee, who has compiled,
from the reports so far received, a table of those States which he
thinks will cast their ballots for the Republican nominees,

Former Chief Lieutenant of

of Jose Yner Balazar, former ohlet lieu

can circles this morning, but uncon

on a charge of leading a conspiracy In
Chihuahua City to turn the garrison

Today's report la that Gen. Jacinto
Trevlno, the arresting officer, so In
censed at Balaiar, who was granted
amnesty but a few weeks tro. shot the
former Oroaqu'sta with his own pistol
when Salaxar was brought before him.
Salaiar has headed more revolts or
been mixed up with more of them than
any other man in Mexico. Recently he
attempted to raise an army to oppose
both Carranza and Villa, but succeeded
In enisling only about ten men.

PROBLEM A R I SES
Department Commanders Must
Send 35,000 Men to Border
As Soon As Possible.
Department commanders of the army
were confronted with a new mobiliza
tion pioblem that of sending 35.000
national guardsmen, now mobilized In
State camps, to thfi border "as soon
as they are etrulppedand transportation
can be obtained."
The troops will be sent reeadtess of
their strength, the heretofore stead
fast rule of the War Department that
no organization should- bo sent to the
border until It had reached Its mini
mum war strength being automatically
countermanded. The regiments will be
filled 110 afer thov have reached their
border canjps, reyults being sent from
the home stations.
While the troops are to bo sent at
once. It was said, there will bo no ques
tion during this mobilization of com
fortable fcQpommadaJlons, on the trip to
the Southern Department champs.
There will bo no haste such as char
acterized the first mobilization order,
and troops will be kept at their camps
until ample traveling arrangements can
be made and adequte food supplies fur
nished, It was said.
Secretary Raker's order sending all
of the mobilized regiments to the
border as soon as possible started
Immediate speculation at the Depart
ment.
"t has no more relation to any
Mexican problem," he replied to an
Inquiry as to Its possible connection
with Mexican relations, "than your
breakfast has to my physical condi
tion." Other high officials said the reason
for sending the troops is that they
"have been hanging around State
carnps long enough and enlistments
aro retarded because many prospec
tive' recruits believe the guardsmen
new will be sent South."

SENATOR OSCAR
Alabama Senator to Fight Dyestuffs Tariff and Tariff
Commission, Both Urged By Wilson, on Ground
That They Are Betrayal of Policy.
With Senator Underwood, author of the Underwood-Simmons
tariff bill, on the war path against the proposed dyestuffs tariff and
the tariff commission urged by President Wilson, Democrats are
meeting this afternoon to thrash out final details of the general rev
enue measure.
Underwood will fight both proposals as denials and betrayals of
the Democratic free trade policy.
Caucus leaders predicted the
test. But there was worry lest underwood snould carry his fight to

campaign material.

LEAPS1EE
SMALL CHANCE
OF AGREEMENT
Managers Stand Firm on Their
Decision to Submit Dispute
to Arbitration.
NOT ACCEPTABLE TO MEN
Eight-hour Day Declared Fed
eral Fixture and Not Sub
ject for Suoh Parley.
NEW YORK, Aug. 13. Shortly
before noon today the delegates of
the four railroad brotherhoods be
gan to arrive at Webster Hall, for
their final conference to determine
whether there shall be a strike.
There were 600 in all.
They 'were followed sw-vtne
United States mediators, Jutffe
Martin A. Kna'pp; Judge JW. L.
Chambers, and G. W. W. Hanger,
whose efforts at mediation yester
day resulted in flat failure.
Before the meeting, which wis
really a last forelorn hope, both
the brotherhood leaders and the
conciliation board professed a de
sire that some amicable agreement
might be reached.
The mediators, in constant touch
with President Wilson, who gare
up his week-end vacation to watch
the situation, declared that if both
sides would arbitrate a country
wide disaster might be averted.
PESSIMISTIC AIR.
But there was & pesslmtsUo air about
the whole gathering. The mediators
had conferred with the railroad man
agers and the latter had flatly reftued
to agree to the demand for an eight
hour day, with time and a half for over
time, plus all the concessions enjoyed
by the men under the ten-hour day.
They were willing to throw the whole
situation Into the melting pot and arbi
trate all the issues anew, but to this
the men took exception.
They demand the eight-hour day, with
time and half for overtime, on all
freight service, and they want shorter
trains run.
The delegates reflect the sentiment of
the 100,000 railroad employes In deoite
Ing to listen to arbitration and their
attitude was exemplified by Austin B.
Qorretson, president of the board of
Railroad Conductors, who asked a re
porter If he would arbitrate his a
tlonallty. That Is, the eight-hour day Is re
garded as a Federal fixture by the men,
and, therefore, non-arbitrable.
They asked yesterday for a specific
proposition from the managers, giving
an Idea of the scope of any proposed
arbitration.
Real Stumbling Block.
The stumbling block Is not so mueh
the elghthour dav as the continuation
of the ten-hour dav privileges under
tho eight-hour day.
For Instance, at present a train crew
takes a freight train on a run of ten
hours, running slowlv. or In lets time
If the enalneer speeds ud a bit. In the
middle of the run the train crew Is set
to work unloading several cars of tit.
or other railroad material.
For whatever tlmo thdat work takes,
the crew Is paid extra. The roods want
to abolish such allowances as this, and
they assort If they grant the eight
hour day they mit have arbitration on
such problems as this, which Is only
one of a thousand.
No Request to Wilson.
A, B. Qarretson, of the brotherhoods,
said the employes had not made, and
probably would not make, a formal re
quest for President Wilson to take a
hand. He said, though, that he wes
gratified to hear President Wilson had
volunteered to Intervene, and undoubt
edly the brotherhoods would accept tha
President's good onices.
An Indication of the Intense acutenese
of the situation, despite the hope held
out In the announcement that the
brotherhoods probably will take no
drastic action until the President per
sonally has heard both sides, developed
when It became known that the train
men have discussed details of the pror
gram to be followed In the event of a
strike.
TKese plans, according to authorita
tive Information, would be for a simul
taneous walk-out of all employes affili
ated with the four big brotherhoods.
Once the brotherhoods executive board
Is convinced a tie-up Is necessary to,
