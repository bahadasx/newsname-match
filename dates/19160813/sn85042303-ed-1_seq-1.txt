ITALIAN ATTACK AIMS AT TRIESTE AFTER THE CAP

GEN. CflNtVR HMD MRP
The Operations of th Italians ngainrt the Austrians are shown on the
accompanying iunp, and the portrait is that of the Italian (ieneral Caneva.
who ranks next to (ieneral Cndorna, the. Italian chief commander. The
Italian advance on the line of the Isonzo -the greatest gain they have made
since they reached the river at the beginning of the war is shown on this
map by two lines, the heavy solid line marine their front at the time their
attack began, on August 4, and the dotted line the approximate present front
as indicated by the official reports. The nio.st significant points in the terri
tory which they have gained nro the two mountain ridges, Monte Sahotino
and Monte San Mlehele. The struggle fcr both of these has been long and
desperate, the reason being that, ns tho map shows, the Italians, possessing
them, command the low ground along tho 'river between them and the city
of Goeritz or Gorizia, which lies on that low ground, (iorizla once captured,
it is expected the Italians will bo able te begin nn advance along the lower
Isonzo toward the important city of Trieste and the district of lstria.

IS NOT GONE

EDWARD GALT HAS PERSONALLY
AGREED TO TAKE CARE OF TAX
PENALTIES ON PROPERTY AND
MEETS OBLIGATIONS.
"The hotel project has not gone
a-glimmering," said Edward Gait yes
terday. "I notice in The Ardmoreite
of Friday that Mr. Yell makes the
statement that no taxes or penalties
will be remitted, but that will not
stand for one moment in the way of
the construction of the hotel." j
Mr. Gait stated that the local people
entered into a contract to clear the
property of all' penalties on past due
taxes. Mr. Sharpe agreed to pay six
per cent interest on all deferred taxes
but he did not take kindly to the pay-!
ment of the penalty of eighteen per
cent, and the local promoters agreed
to take care of that sum. Mr. Gait
became personally responsible for the
fnll amount of the penalties yesterday
and he will have the help of all others
of the local promoters in caring for
the expense nrcessary to clear title
to the lot, and to carry out the origi
nal contract made with Mr. Sharpe.
. Mr. Gait and others of the promo
ters wanted the Board of County Com
missioners to remit a portion of the
penalties due for unpaid paving taxes,
but it is doubtful if the commission
has such authority, and whether it
has or not does not make one bit of
difference in the building of the pro-
posed new hotel. As far as Ardmore
is concerned this city has met every I
j portion of the contract it entered into j
and as far as this city knows, Mr. .
.Sharpe is making absolutely good on I
his portion of the deal. The plans !
f or the new structure are now being
