Wilson Takes Initial
Step to Avert National
Strike of Railroad Men
President Wilson has taken his fIrst
step to prevent a national railroad tie
up.
lie has instructed Commissioner Will
jan L. Chambers, of the Federal Board
of Mediation and Conciliation, to Invite
the representatives of four railroad
brotherhood. and the committee of rail
way managers to confer with him here if
mediation fails.
The announcement that the Federal
mediators have asked the railway em
ployes to agree to arbitrate their differ
ences with the roads and that the em
ployes asked for twenty-four hours in
which to consider it. caused some relief
in Washin;ton. A break 3esterday had
been feared.
It was stated at the White House yes
terday that the President'a request will
not be presented unless mediation efforts
fall entirely.
His object in sending instruction to
Judge Chambers was to put Into effect
executive intervention before either side
co ld take '.ction precipitating a national
strike.
It is believed in some nuarters here
that intervention is alreadv a failure,
but the President does not entertain that
view.
lIe is anxio s. it was said. that every
process and remedy provided by law
shall be exhausted before he actively
Interve es.
Will Accept lnvitati.n.
it is now expected that the invitation
to 1h,- representativ. of the roads and
to the men to confer with the President in
Washington will not be delivered until
after todav's conferences.
It is not doubted that. if artbitration
Is not agreed to, the roads and men will
accept Preident Wilson's invitation.
While it has no mandatory character.
it Is believed it will receive the constd
eration demanded by the President's of
ifce.
Certainty is expressed in administra
tIon circles that a strike will he avoided
and that finall, the brotherhoods if they
meet the President, will discuss the sit
uation with him, in terms of conciliation
and aeconmmodation.
It is helieved the President will impress
upon both sides the public necessity for
avoiding a strike, which would paralyze
the transportation facilities and prostrate
the industries of the country.

Pierce said that lie would notify the

he would have his own men there to
protect him, he said.
"At a conference Friday afternoon,"
said Pierce. "Maj. Pullman promiised
me that he would allow m to sieak
with police protection. but suggested
that I cut out all unpleasant remarks
about the militia for the time being.
as a good deal of feeling had been
