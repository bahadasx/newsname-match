Allegations of Austria That

WILL MAKE PROTEST
IF FACTS WARRANT
No Further Evidence Received
on Batavier Case to Dis
prove Mine Theory

International News Servh-e:
WASHINGTON. May IS. The
French and Italian governments
face a ser.ous reckoning with the
state department ir allegations of
th Austro-Hungarian government
are proved that French and Italian
submarines have attacked an Aus
trian passenger boat and a hospital
ship. The state department today
was awaiting with interest receipt of
a note reported to have been handed
to Ambassador Pentield as well as
the diplomitic representatives of the
other neutral powers In Vienna.
The Austrian government charges
French and Italian submarine craft
with "intention murder" and sets
forth in detail the circumstance. un
der which the Austrian passenger
ship Dubrovnik was sunk in the
Adriatic and the hospital ship Elec
tra was also torpedoed. It also is
charged that other peaceable Aus
trian ships rHve been torpedoed
without warning. The Austrian note
is expected to reach the state depart
ment today. Orticials tirst will make
careful inquiry to ascertain if any
Americans were among those lost in
these reported attacks.
.May Diiat'li Protect.
Whether Americans were lost or
not. the statement department, it is
expected, will dispatch a vigorous
protest to the offending government
if the facts are found to be as al
lege1. It now appears that subma
rines of the allied powers have been
engaged in precisely the same prac
tices which have, brought yuch bitter
denunciation upon Germany. Iioth
Great Britain and France have fur
nished valuable evidence to the
United States in proving its subma
rine cases against Germany. This
was notably true in establishing Ger
many's responsibility for the torpe
doing of the Sussex.. It seems prob
able that the United States forth
with will inquire from the allies
what instructions submarine com
manders are working under.
The stat; department still is wait
ing for further evidence as to the
circumstances of the sinking of the
Dutch steamer Batavier V, with the
lo.s of ono American. Early re
ports indicate that the ship struck a
mine. Should this prove to be the
case, no action will be possible by
this government.
Another" dispatch was .received
from the American embassy at Lon
don today on the sinking of the Ba
tavier V, but it did not clear up def
initely how the vessel was blown up.
Samuel Howard Comstock, one of
the Americans saved, gave it as his
opinion that the explosion was
caused by a mine. The dispatch
was as follows:
4 Dutch steams-hip Batavier V
from Tilbury to Rotterdam with pas
sengers and cargo, sunk by explosion
yesterday it noon. Luigi Martini
Mancini. wireless expert, American
citizen of New Mexico. drowned.
S'amuel Howard Comstock and John

testify that the day before her body
was found in the woods, she wan
intently studying a chapter In her
chemistry text book on the actions
of cyanides. And the book, with tne
notes wrtten in the margins will be
produced as exhibit A. It was cy
anide of potassium that was fouml
on her cheeks ;is she lay under the
trees. Crystals of it were also
under her linger rails. ind h-r
stomach contained considerably
piantity of the de.ollv poiaui.
The defence is confident th.it
yournc HusseU's testimony will pj
far, if not proving conclusively, to
fhow that Marian I-nnbert herself
took the poison to escape Urn dis
grace which she felt was impeixlin.
Study C'janiclcs.
Marian Lambert's chemistry class
in Deertield hisrh school was study
ing the chapter on cyanides the week
that she died.

the book to reporters. "This l-;--on

Marian came to school. The .hob

Marian especially. She m-ver paiI
much attention to her studies any

she stopped giKdini: and began writ

the p aues containing the lesson for
the next Thursday. She turnel tm
patfes and marked them rapidly.
She was paying the strlctet
attention when Prof. Cra-K told
us how deadly cyanides wt-re. It
struck me as sort of funny."

date, "for Thürs.. Feb. 10." it w as
on Thursdav. Feb. 10. that the aej

Could i;'t Poison.
The defence will set forth that the
girl had unlimited oportumties to
pet the poison from the lar;.'e storey
kept in h r father's workshop. Th

will contend that Marian mu- luv
