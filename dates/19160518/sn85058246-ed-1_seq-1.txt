Considerable criticism Is being
heard for tho way tho- Box Elder
county road officiate aro neglecting
tho Urigham City canyon road. It is
said a good road has been built to
tlio Box Elder lino through tho Wolls
vllle canyon but It appears tho offl
clala of tho adjoining county prefer
to make u good road up tho valloy
north of Brlgham Instead of doing
anything through tho canyon. This
Is a matter that should, be corrected.
tallied In Jowelry, confectlonn-y,

HENDRICKSON
HAS PLANS
FORFAGTORY
Tho stato press s quoting T. R.
Cutler, general manager of tlw Utah
Idaho Sugar Company, as saying ho
has no knowlcdgo of tlio new sugar
factory proposed by John A, Hen
drlckson nnd others In Cacho Valley,
and that ho has understood that tho
factory Is to bo constructed by tho
Amalgamated Sugar Company.
If Mr. Cutler Is saying tho things
accredited to him, It would appear
that he has forgotten tho conversa
tion that ho had last week with Mr.
Hendrlckson nnd others.
Mr. Hendrlckson has In his office
at Logan, tho plans for tho West
Cacho Sugar Company as proposed
by tho manufacturers of sugar fac
tories. Ho also has tho names of tho
men who havo subscribed for stock
In tho new concern. So from this It
would seem that tho Cache Valloy
farmprs and tho Hendrlckson associ
ates hnvo gono, too, far with their
proposition to luy down- now.
TREASURER IS
BEING UNJUSTLY
CRITICISED
There seems to bo a disposition on
tho part of tho shifty Democratic ad
ministration In tho Cncho County
court houso to saddle off on Treasur
er Gcorgo S. Dairies, tho rcspoii3l
billty for tho muddlo which the lis
scssor nnd tho commissioners havo
gotten Into on account of tho faulty
work of field assessors which has
brought nbout all kinds of trouble
tr6m land owners and property own
era who havo been ovpr assessed, un
der nsscsscd, and some not nssessed
nt all.
Tho Logan postmaster Is criticis
ing tho treasurer for tho way tho no.
ttces havo been mailed out and thoso
close to tho situation claim that tho
postmaster Is doing for political rea
sons, but Trensurcr Dalnes seems to
ho Canal to tho occasion and when It
really dawns upon tho postmaster
nnd his legion of followers that tho
Democratic assessor and his assist
ants aro at fault a solar plexus will
bo delivered that will not loso Its
sting for somo time to come.
It appears that tho county assess
or In making up his tax rolls over
looked tlw fact that It was his legal
duty to have his field men obtnln tho
street address of all persons assess
ed with property. And as n conse
quence the mall carriers In Logan
City undjr tho direction of tho post
master aro unablo to locate' the ad
dresses of tho citizens of the com
munity with tho plain address Logau
City, on tho envelope.
While Mr. Dalnes sent out tho no
tices, they hnvo been Bent out to
thoso persons listed by tho assessor
and becauso tho assessor has not
dono his duty, It Is no fault of tho
treasurer's office, although a strained
effort Is being made by tho postmast
er and the other court houso officials
to fix tho responsibility on him.
Sargent Meyers of tho U. S. army
will meet at tho Club rooms between
four and six o'clock on Thursday,
Friday and Saturday of this week,
all local members of the U. S. Cav
alry and tako their measurements for
suits, Arrangements nro being mado
In conjunction with tho Commercial
Club, to havo a grand ball at tho Au
ditorium on Decoration Day. Tho
local organization will bo known as
