J. T. MORRIS OF DOYON GIVES
STRONG REASONS FOR WILLIS
TON MAN'S NOMINATION
Burdick For Governor Club
Williston, N. D.
Saying nothing against anyone
else not reflecting on the integrity
of any other candidate, and, regard
less of strict adherence to party lines,
I believe that U. L. Burdick is the
logical man for Governor. Why you
ask? Well, he is a man in all the
word implies a manly man, a man's
man, consequently a strong man, a
fearless man. He is in the prince of
life.
He is intellectual, he is honorable,
consequently honest cannot be swerv
ed from the path of duty nor be
lead to a betrayal of any trust that
the people may place in him, or any
office that the voters may elect him
to, to serve the interests of any
clique, corporation or designing pol
iticians, whose only aim is to grab
as much "pie" as possible regardless
of the rights of the people of the
state generally.
Some will smile at his assertion
others say: "Oh, pshaw! he's just
the same as most other office seekers
and political asperants/' We who
know him, know him from childhood
to manhood, from the time he left
discouraged at his future outlook in
life, at a time when vicissitudes were
staring him in the face, when a
weaker man (he was then only a boy)
would have only become a plodder,
he, Mr. Burdick, braced back his
shoulders, went to work and by sheer
pluck and energy pushed himself
through school and finally graduated
with honor from the law department
of the University of Minnesota and
throughout it all was noted for his
honesty, integrity and morality,
therefore, we who know him so well,
would not listen to a word question
ling his uprightness without protest
ing the suae in forcible manner.
Was he a good member of the
Legislature? Was he honest? Yes.
As a speaker of the House was he
fair and impartial? Yes. Was he a
good Lieutenant Governor? Yes. Did
he wilfully betray and trust imposed
in him? No. Was he capable? Yes.
Did he make any enemies? Yes.
Who? Those who couldn't twist him
their way to serve some selfish pur
pose to the detriment of the interests
of the State.
Yes, Mr. Voter, Burdick is the
"logical" man—the man who will do
all in his power to serve the state in
an honorable, upright business man
ner, and he is one who can and will
"look any man in the eye" (who tries
to lead him to betray the trust the
people impose in him) and tell him
where to go. Therefore he is the man
we want.

Doyon, N. D.

the club entirely unsolicited.
Larkin C. Hart For 2d
District Commissioner
The long list of political announce
ments was joined this week by that of
Larkin C. Hart, who places his can
candidacy before the voters of the
Second Commissioners District for
member of the county board. The dis
trict has been represented by A. P.
Hegge, whose term has expired and
who has declared that he will not be
a candidate to succeed himself. The
people of the Second District are very
fortunate in having an oportunityto
vote for a man of the type of Mr.
Hart, who, during his long residence
has shown himself an energetic and
public spirited citizen, well informed
on matters of public interest and al
ways wiling to do his part. Mr.
Hart, if elected, will undoubtedly
make a competent and satisfactory
commissioner.
Captain Bailey Will
Install Power Ferry
Captain Bailey's ferry boat "City
of Mondak" was brought up from
Elks Landing this week to be put in
commission as a public ferry at the
site just below the island. The City
of Mondak is a large power boat, and
the captain says that it will also be
used in carrying on the construction
work of the pontoon bridge that will
be constructed by the Missouri River
Bridge Company.

NOUNCE POSITION RELATIVE
TO BOOSTER MARKET DAY
At a meeting of the Directors of the

13th. Max Zimmerman outlined his
plans for the booster Market Day
Celebration to be held May 27th.
After hearing Mr. Zimmerman's
plans the directors voted to take no
action in the matter owing to the
fact hat Mr. Zimmerman's apparent
ultimate object for having such a

Famous 9-Brothers
Team To Play Here
Local lovers of base ball may have
an opportunity this summer to see the
famous Sorlien Brothers team that re
ceived so much publicity last summer
in the pages of numerous magazines.
They are without doubt the champion
brother ball team of the United States.
The boys are located at different
points but several of them are at or
near Decorah, Iowa, which is their
old home. Several of the boys at
tended Luther College in that town
and have made names for themselves
in athletic annals. Each summer, as
far as possible, the boys get together
at some point, usually the old home,
and play a few games of ball with
other strong teams.
Carl J. Sorlien of Rawson was in
Williston recently and stated that he
was trying to arrange to have his
eight brothers come to McKenzie
county this summer. If he succeeds
it is altogether probable that a game
will be arranged "between the Sorlien
Brothers team and the Williston Op
portunes. Ifthey should meet it will
be a game of great interest.
Eddy Himberry one of the new men
jn the Williston team says he par
ticipated in a game against the Sor
lien brothers a couple of years ago,
and that it was one of the best games
he ever played in, the score being one
to nothing. One of the Sorlien boys
is expected to play with the fast
team that Ray is getting together.
Dean Babcock Hon
ored by Appointment
Dean E. J. Babcock of the college
of mining engineering of the state
university, has been appointed by
government officials at Washington,
D. C., as director for North Dakota
of the national industrial survey.
The selection is eminently fitting,
as there are, by technical training and
extensive service on scientific, engi
neering and industrial problems, few
men more thoroughly familiar with
the industrial possibilities and re
sources of the northwest, and particu
larly of North Dakota, than is Dean
Babcoclc.
This national industrial survey,
when completed, should be of very
great value to the government and to
the country as an aid in stimulating
greater development of resources and
diversification of industries, a matter
of the utmost importance to the coun
try in general and especially to North
Dakota.
PRAIRIE FIRES IN DUNN CO.
Dunn Center, N. D., May 17.—The
north country experienced a bad
prairie fire which burned through a
strip of about ten miles in length and
so fast did the blaze travel that it
was impossible to head it off with
bac kfires, and it continued to travel
until it brought up at the edge of a
plowed field.
Hundreds of acres of splendid hay
land was burned over and thus ruin
ed for the season, and considerable
damage was caused to settlers, Mrs.
Augusta Akers
probablv
being the
heaviest loser. Her farm was direct
ly in the path of the head fire and it
was only by diligent work that the
dwelling and chicken coop were saved,
while she lost ten pigs, al lof her chick
ens and ducks, 300 fence posts, straw
barn, hog house and pen and a stack
of hay.
It was fortunate for her that Bill
Baker was present at the time, doing
repair work on the house, and it was
mainly through his efforts that the
dwelling and chicken coop were saved.
The fire originated on the Guy Mor
rison farm from a straw stack that
had been set afire several days pre
vious.
BOOK TUI MEN OUT
OF THE EUROPEAN WW
MOELLRING JOINS LITERARY
RANKS—HIS NOVEL, THE NEU
TRAL'S PORTION OUT SOON
A novel* that will perhaps rank
among the best sellers and which will
be in the hands of book sellers within
three or four weeks was written by a
Williams county author. The work
will bear the title: "The Neutral's
Portion," and the author's name, on
the title page, will be George Henry
Moellring. Mr. Moellring who is well
known as an attorney of Ray, this
county, wrote the book last fall and
later went east and arranged with a
publishing house to bring out the
work. It is usually not easy for an
author to find publishers for his
maiden effort, but Mr. Moellring ex
perienced little difficulty. The Inter
national Magazine, who are publish
ing the book, and the literary critics
employed by them, fouftd much merit
in the work, and believe that on ac
count of its timely theme a ready sale
will be found. The book will be dress
ed in an attractive binding and will be
illustrated by one of the most cele
brated artists in the east. The theme
of the work is a conservative but logi
cal argument against the munitions
traffic in this country. Cleverly inter
woven with this is the thread of a
pretty love story that carries the
reader from one side of the Atlantic
to the other. The chief scenes of the
book are laid in a factory town of the
middle west.
While in Williston this week Mr.
Moellring received a telegram from
the publishers stating that the page
proofs of the work had been received,
and that the first copies could be ex
pected in a few weeks.
Several local people had the privi
lege of seeing the manuscript of the
book before Mr. Moellring sent it east,
and feel that local readers will find
The Neutral's Portion a story con
taining both substance and engaging
interest.,.' »•..~
Schools Of County Will
Meet For Play Program
May 27th, which falls on Saturday,
marks the First Annual play Car
nival, which will be participated in by
children from all the schools of the
county both rural and city. There will
be a fine program of athletic events
with appropriate ribbon badges for
the winners. Banners will be pre
sented to the schools winning the most
points, and the individual contestant
winning the highest number of points
will receive a medal. Gatherings of
this kind, it is believed, are well cal
culated to arouse school spirit and
enthusiasm through the association
of different parts of the county, and
the friendly rivalry of the contests.
LOST HER EQUILIBRIUM ONLY
Dainty Aline Bartlett, who plays a
part in "The Fourth Estate," a Wil
liam Fox motion picture, proved her
self to be a daring young woman and
possessed of gift that surprised her
friends, during the making of the pic
ture in Chicago. It was necessary for
the young woman to jump through a
window and rush down a fire escape
to the street. The fire escape was a
pair of stairs that extended out
straight but swung downward to the
sreet when a person walked out on
it. In her wild rush for action, Miss
Bartlett miscalculated and lost her
balance. In her fall she grabbed the
swinging stairs and held on until she
was rescued. The director of the
picture believed that the accident
would unnerve the young woman and
advised her to take the day off and
rest up after her narrow escape.
"Oh, no I won't," said the little
ingenue. "We'll go right on the take
it over again." Needless to say, Miss
Bartlett made an instantaneous hit
with the director, who was behind his
schedule on account of the bad
weather.
The Fourth Estate at Lyric, Thurs
day and Friday, May 25 and 26.
ELLENDALE WILL REBUILD
Ellendale, N. D., May 17.—Debris
of the recent fire was still smoulder

side of Main street, contracts had
been let for new buildings, and the
work of dismantling the old buildings
would have commenced today. The
fire did the removing in a most effi
cient way.
The fire insurance foots up $165,

where the loss is total, the remainder
is on broken glass, removal and wa

DAY OF CELEBRATION
IN NORWAY'S MEMORY
PARADE, ADDRESSES, FLAGS,
MUSIC AND DANCING COM
PLETE GREAT DAY
Favored by beautiful weather the
celebration of May 17th by the Nor
wegians of the community was by far
the largest and most successful affair
of its kind ever held in this city. Early
in the day business houses decorated
their fronts with flags of Norway as
well as with Stars and Stripes. All
business places which could reason
ably do so closed their doors during
the parade and exercises.
Led by a well designed float repre
senting the Viking ship the unusually
long parade of gaily decorated autos
started from the Armory and went
south on First Avenue East turning
into Main Street from Broadway,
thence south to First Street and north
on First Avenue West. One especial
ly attractive feature to the parade
was a large auto truck bearing a com
pany of young ladies dressed in na
tive custom's of Norway. The Wil
liston Concert Band supplied the
martial music. Immediately after the
parade the great assembly that had
gathered from country and town as
sembled in the auditorium of the
Armory building to listen to the pro
gram of music and speaking.
After an overture by the band, Otis
A. Houge, as president of the day,
introduced by fitting remarks Presi
dent Thos. Craven of the City Com
mission, who delivered the address of
welcome. Following this the band
played America. An address by H.
W. Braatelien was the next number.
A Male octette sang "Ja Vi Elsker
Dette Landet." Following this Lars
J. Siljan, well known lecturer and edi
tor of the Normanden, delivered the
principle address of the day. After
a brief introduction in English, Mr.
Siljan spoke in his native tongue.
Prof. Onstad favored the audience
With *vito»fr
man Batten made the concluding ad
dress. The large audience arose while
the band concluded the program with
the Stars and Stripes. The addresses
by all the speakers were of excep
tional interest and eloquence, and
were received with frequent applause.
The ball game advertised for 6:30
did not materialize as it was impos
sible to secure an outside team. Very
few towns have their ball teams or
ganized. The grand ball on the Arm
ory floor which began at 9:15 was
largely attended and a highly enjoy
able affair.
It was a day that must have brought
joy and satisfaction to the hearts of
the sons and daughters of Norway,
and was a great credit to their energy
and love of mother country. All de
tails were carefully attended to, and
the automobile parade was one of the
largest ever witnessed in the state,
over one hundred and thirty ma
chines being in line.
Announcement To
Base Ball Patrons
Although, in recent years, 25 cent
base ball has prevailed in Williston,
the base ball board has decided that
for the present season a general ad
mission of 35 cents is not only neces
sary but reasonable. Therefore that
figure has been fixed with a nominal
charge of 10 cents for the youngsters
under the age of 15. The grand
stand, which has been inclosed, and
which is intended, so far as required,
About so much money must be
raised to support first class base ball
and by a ten cent increase in the price
of admission the cost is more equally
and generally distributed.
To secure enough games, teams, in
some instances, will have to be
brought long distances Glendive,
Glasgow, Minot, Cando, etc., and the
gate receipts must at least pry the
expenses of the visiting team.
In very few places is high class
ball provided at so low an admission
as 25 cents. Everywhere in Montana
it is 50 cents which enables the Mon
tana towns to support fast teams—
teams with which the Williston Op
portunes must hold their own.
The board is striving to give Wil
liston a ball team of which it will be
proud at the lowest practical cost.

Seventy-Five Bandits Captured
Marathon, Texas, May 17.—A truck
driver arriving here this afternoon
from Bouquillas, said it is reported
on the border that Major Langhorne
and two troops of cavalry had sur
rounded the Big Ben raiders about
125 miles from the border, killing si*
and captured 75. Army officers her*
have made no announcement regard

to the truck driver's report, the ban

Namiquipa, Mex., -May 17.—Amer
ican residents of this section of Mex
ico have assured General Pershing1
that American troops have restored
respect on the part of the natives for
the United States soldiers to a de
gree not existing for five years. For
some time, Mexicans have sneered'at
the fighting ability of the Americans,
some of them honestly believing that
the United States soldiers were afraid
to engage any Mexican command.
After the Ojo-Azules fight, how
ever, signs of growing respect on the
part of the natives became more and
more manifest. American non-com
batants living in the vicinity were
treated with a courtesy, which aston
ished them, the like of which they had'
not experienced for years.
These Americans, however, openly
express their intention of leaving
Mexico if the expeditionary command
is withdrawn. They believe a aalh*
uprising will result immediately altar

Removed.
Numerous threats on the part' of
Vlllft and his lieutenants topunish
persons dealing with Americans ahf
have caused some Mexicans and
Chinese merchants to announce that
they, too, will follow the American
command from Mexico, should it h*
withdrawn.
Mrs. Deemer Is Overjoyed'
El Paso, Tex., May 17.—Mrs. JJ.
Deemer, on her way from Da Jolla,
near San Diego, Cal., to Bouqufllaa,
Texas, where her husband was kid
napped by the Mexican Big Bend raid
ers, was overjoyed when she heard
the report that American troopers had
rescued Deemer. Mrs. Deemer had
given up hope of her husband being
alive and was proceeding to Bouquillas
to assume charge of their property.

States soldiers have rescued J. Deem
er, the American storekeeper cap
tured by Mexican raiders on Glenn
Springs and Bouquillas, Tex., accord

soldiers entered a village 125 miles
below the border and the bandits
rushed out leaving Deemer and a cap

Payne and Deemer are being brought
back to the United States.
Brief Naval Battle
Off Belgian Coast
London, May 17.—A naval engage
ment occurred yesterday off the Bel
gian coast between small German and
British warships. There were n»
British casualties.
An official announcement of the
fight was made as follows: "An en
counter took place yesterday after
noon off the Belgian coast between a
force composed of British destroyers
and monitors and some German de
stroyers. After a short engagement
the enemy withdrew to their ports.
Our forces sustained no casualties."
"MY FLAG"
Under the word "Mine" and a beau
tiful reproduction of the American na
tional banner, the North Dakota state
railroad commission is sending the fol
lowing sentiment if true citizenship,
to North Dakota:
"In this country there is just one
right basis for political action. That
basis is neither race, nor creed, nor
sex, nor wealth, nor occupation. It is
just American citizenship. To add to*
or substract from that, in relation to'
any of the things affecting our pub
lic relations is a denial of the very
principles on which the American na
tion is fouM."
