look to the town.
Is it necessary to clean up? If
so why not just let every one
look after his own premises as
he sees bosty Surely few people
looking around over our town
would need to ask these ques
tions. We are quick to notice
things when our attention is
called to thorn and we would all
be anxious to have our places
cleaned up if wo knew that our
neighbor., would be doing the
same thing at the same time.
We feel bi'tior, have more selt
respect, we really are better, in
clean and beautiful surrounding.
We take a greater pride in show
ing our little city to our visitors.
But more iinoortant than this,
we make it a better place for our
young people to live and wo
place bettor influences around
them.
Can it bo done? Certainly it
can. Hayti can do what other
towns can. Her people will be
glad to observe the day. The
children are always ready to
help with anything of the kind if
there is anyone to lead them and
they accomplish wondors. Let's
try it and .,eo what we can do for
our town, proving that wo are
not behind other towns in our
civic pride.
