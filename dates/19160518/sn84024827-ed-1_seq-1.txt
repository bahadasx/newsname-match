GOVERNOR
(By Review Leased Wire)'
DOGULAS, May 17. Adolf o de la
Huerta arrived today in Herniosillo,
according to a telegram received at
the headquarters of General P. Ellas
Calles, military governor of Sonora,
end tomorrow, according to Ives G.
Lelevier, Mexican- consul, will take
office as civil governor of Sonora.
Calles To Be Supreme
It is broadly intimated in official
quarters that de la Huerta while gov
ernor in name, will be subordinate in
every detail to General Calles, who re-
tains the position of commander in
chief of the twenty thousand troops
assembled in the state. This Is a cer
tainty, almost, as de la Huerta has
publicly pledged himself to continue
General Calles' policies and to retain
all of his appointees in the various
state offices. Thus General Calles
will not alone retain all power but by
a mere word would be In position to
set aside any of the civil governor's
official acts.
For Countrymen
Mr. Lelevier returned today from
Phoenix where he interviewed Gover
nor George W. P. Hunt of Arizona, as
well as the state board of pardons in
relation to reprieves for Francisco
Rodricuei, who is sentenced to be
hanged for murder at the state prison
in Florence May 19, and for Eduardo
