Washington, May 18. Germany,
thru Count yon Bernstorff, has in
structed all German consuls in .the
United States to admonish all German
citizens in their districts to observe
American laws. This was doije to
prevent alleged violations of Ameri
can neutrality.
The ambassador acted on instruc
tions from the Berlin foreign office.
The following statement was issued:
"In consequence of cases which have
occurred of late, the German am
bassador, has sent instructions to all
Germa*r consuls in the United States
to strongly impress on German citi
zens living in., their districts that It "Ts
their duty to obey the laws of the state
in which' they reside."
It was said at' the German ejnbaesy
that the Instructions'were designed to
prevent plots of lawlessness' on the
part of German citizens.
•Does Not Countenance Plots.
It was made clear-that Berlin offi
cials want the United States and its
people to understand that they have
not countenanced any llife^al afEairs
with which German citizens or sympa
thizers in this country have been con
nected.
The ambassador's instructions ,were
forwarded to the German consuls inv
mediately.
The Instructions, It was said, were
not due to any action by the United
States. I,t is believed thay the in

Petrograd,t May "17—With the ad
vance of Russian forces southward
from the .Urumiah region toward Mosul,
in Assyria, on the Tigris, which -re
sulted recently in the occupation', of
Rivandouza, -the Russians are-. now
bringing fresh pressure of the most
powerful sort upon the rear of the
Turkish armies in Mesopotamia.
The development of tills new line of
attack has greatly .enhanced the
chances of success of the Russian cam
paign in Mesopotamia, which holds
forth the hope now entertained in Pe
trograd of bringing not only Bagdad,
the holy city1 of the pallphs, but the en
tire historTo country lying between the
Tigris and the Euphrates under Rus
sian dominion.
Advancing on Mosul.
Of the twovgTOups ,of' Russian armies
wljich are now -threatening Mesopo
tamia overland the one already men
tioned has crossed the .r Mesopotamia
border and is marching rapidly toward
Mosul.
The only setrious obstacle between it
and this goal is the ancient fortified
city of Jeziher-Ibn-Omar, on"" an island
in the Tigris 1-30 miles southeast of
Dlarbekr. It is- believed this city, with
its antiquated -defenses, will not be
able loner to delay the Russian advance.
The progress of these forces already
has broken the backbone of the Turkish
communications between Oiarbekr and
Mosul and the Turkish armies covering
these two points are now separated ex
cept for a circuitous road too far in the
rear to b$. of much Service.

Some 200. miles southward the other
group of Russian forces drawn up on
^e Persian Turkish border before
Tthanikin is prepared to strike thru to
Bagdad.
The combined pressure from thfese
two directions upon the Turkish reaj
has placed the entire Turkish army In
Mesopotamia, estimated at between six
and seven divisions, in ,the greatest
Jeapardy*
According to the latest dispatches
the Turks have been foroed to relax to
4C great eactent their resistance to the
British expe"aitibnary army and rush
trooiis'northward. Thus it is thought
the successes which have been won by
the Russians will soon have an effect
on the fortunes of the British cam
paign. ,'

PEACE MEN DEBATE WAR.
Lake Mohonk Conference Considers
Compulsory Enforcement.
Mohonk t»ake, N. Y„ May 18.—The
use of military compulsion by a group
of nations to prevent war, which Is
the most radical feature of the plan
advocated by the League to Enforce
Peace, was debated today before the
Lake Mohonk conference on interna
tional. arbitration. The ^proposition
was favored by Herbert S. Houston
and
George iHaven Putman. New York
publishers, and opposed by Dr. James
L. Tryon, of Boston, director of the
New ®ng\and department of thf Am
erican Peace Society, and Alpheus H.
Snow, a Washington, D. C.. lawyer.
"Peace between nations." said Mr.
Houston, "just as does peace within
nations, must rest on force. Peace
must be put orf' a war footing and its
advocates must quit the forum for the
field, if need be, to fight, not to urge
war, but to establish peace."
"The international tribunal__at th»
Hague," Dr. Putman said, hat! the
weakness of presenting no provision
for the enforcing, of the decisions of
the tribunal. In every civilized state
decisions now are arrived at in court.
These decisions would have little val
ue, however, in maintaining peac^ in
the communities unless, back of the
authorities the court, stood an or
ganized force."
Dr. Tryon's view was that the Unit
ed States might wisely "co-operate,, if
need be. with other nations by force
for the preservation of public safety
in specific emergencies like the Boxer
rebellion, bu,t be in a position to with
draw when It considered the purpose
sufficiently fulfilled without taking the
obligations of an alliance with all its
possible entanglements."
Mr. .Snow aftid the plan of the
league!? was di^gei-qus chiefly because
It proposed "to us# joint instead of
United force, and provides no executive
to dlreot the force.

iPeace Conference at Lake M^honk
Divided Over Plans to Prevent War.
Washington, May 18.—'In deciding
pon the increase of the navy, the
house naval committee today voted to
abandon the ftve-yegr building pro
gram and to recommend that five bat
tle cruisers, to cost $20,438,581 each,
four scout cruisers, ten torpedo boat
destroyers, twenty submarines, on6
hospital Ahtp, one oil supply ship and
one ammunition supply ship be' built
during the 1917 fiscal year. The com
mittee voted 13 to 8 on battle cruis
ers and submarines.
The committee unanimously adopt
ed a resolution by Representative
Hensley, of Missouri, authorising the
president upon conclusion of the Euro
pean war to invite world powers to a
conference to frame world arbitration
to settle all disputes between nations,
and appropriating *200,000 for the pur
pose.
Secretary Daniels had recommended
as the first year's apportionment two
dreadnaughts, two battle cruisers, two
scout cruisers, fifteen destroyers, one
gunboat and one hospital ship. As to
submarines differences of opinion had
arisen as to the type to be constructed,
and Secretary Daniels had altered his
original plan of five fleet submarines
and twenty-five submersibles.
The committee struck out the bat
tleships,'the gunboat and five destroy

one ®cout cruiser, three supply ships
