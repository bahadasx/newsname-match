BINGHAM COUNTY
SPELLING CONTEST.
Much interest has'Jbeen evinced and
much good wrought by the spelling con
test that is being carried on in this
county. It is a conceded fact that
spelling is one of the most difficult sub
jects to teach with interst and success,
especially so with an inefficient text
book as a guide. The state has a com
mittee appointed now whose business it
is to select a suitable text in spelling,
which we hope will be practicable and
usable, that results may be achieved
that were impossible under previous
conditions.
Knowing all these deplorable condi
tions, County Superintendent Lulah K.
Smith had prepared a list of practical
spelling words sent to each teacher in
the county. These words have been
used all through the grades with much
success, the pupils showing remarkable
advance in ability to spell.
Recently the teachers have tested to
ascertain the best speller in each grade,
to whom neat certificates of award have
been issued. The best speller in the
Seventh and Eighth grades are to spell
for a beautiful silver cup, Saturday, j
May L0, at the Blackfoot High School j
butlding, at 2 o clock P. M. Contest
ants will be given 250 words to write,
«ith an additional 100 in case no one
wins at hi st. These words will be .
graded by out of town judges. The
winner will have Ins or her name en
graved iqioiv the cup but the cup itself j
will belong to the school, to be used m

Paving Bids Considered

Monday night the city council held a
midnight session, opening and discuss
ing the many bids made for furnishing
the city with paving material for the

during which time two executive ses

indulged in by many who admitted that
they kenw nothing of the merits of the
different pavings except by guess or
hearsay. Bitulithic was the onlv sam
pie of paving exhibited The Wheel
j wriglit Bros., of Salt Lake Citv, and an
j Oregon paving company were repre

they had no good sample of their pave

oilman Berryman declared that he had
seen some of their tarvit paving in Og

be considered at all. The Oregon i»av

The body of 8-year-old Helen Kmpey,
who left, her home near Idaho Falls on
April 16 for Sunday school, was found
last Monday in Sand creek bv J. \Y.
Patterson, a farmer of the Idaho Falls
country. The condition of the bndv
indicates long exposure. The bodv was

The little girl left home eiirlv on
April 16 for Sunday ........1, and from
'hat time » until she was found there
has been no clue to her whereabouts.
Various theories have been advanced
regarding her disappearance, but noth

way of facts, until last Monday.
I lie finding of the bodv is unusual
in that the brother of Helen
was kidnaped about a ''-........

„ . The
man who abducted the brother is now '
in the state penitentiary. The Kmpey
family is wealthy, and it was believed
by some that the little girl was taken

held for ransom, but that her abductor«
