There has been some grumb
ling at the county road board in
consequence of the bridgeless
creeks between here and Wii
lard. We can't speak for the
road board. If they want any
speaking done they are amply
able to do it themselves. .- But
one thing is obvious to the most
casual observer, and that is that
there is no money in the road
fund. The statement made by
the treasurer to the commission
ers at the April meeting showed
but $83 70 in the road fund not
enough to pay the foreman s
salary one month. The commis
sioners. as well as the road
board, have been drawing war
rants against the fund The
people of Duran have been mak
ing a holler because it has been
imoossible for an auto to get out
of that town to the north on ac
count of sand. The road board
couldn't make a road there be
cause of lack of funds, and we
understand the state engineer is
going to make a road to let the
Duran people out

WATER TESTS
TO BE
S. S. Carroll, of the state en
gineer's office, was in the coun
ty several days during the past
week going over the well situa
tion in the county with County
Agent Harwell, preparatory to
making the tests of wells and
water mentioned several weeks
ago. With Mr. Harwell, Mr.
Carroll has made a preliminary
survey of the field, and the work
has been planned. The plans
will be submitted to the state en
gineer and the authorities at the
state college, and if they agree
upon the plans they will then be
submitted to the citizens of the
county who are interested. In
asmuch as the citizens are ex
pected to co-operate with the en
gineer's office and the college in
this work, it will be necessary to
have a committee authorized to
agree to the plans and to repre
sent the citizens in the matter.
Therefore it has been agreed to
have a meeting at the county
agent's office next Monday even
ing at 7:30 to organize and ap
point the necessary committee.
There should be a good attend
ance at this meeting, as the sub
ject is one of great importance
to the county. It is the inten
tion to make a test of the few
wells in the county that are in
shape to be tested for flow; to
make analyses of water from all
parts of the county as to quality;
and to make a survey for the
purpose of determining approx-
mately the boundaries of the
shallow water area. The re
ports under these different heads
will be published by authority
of the state engineer and the
college authorities, and this is
why the work will be so impor
tant for the county. While it
cannot be expected that the re
ports will be exhaustive, they
will go into detail sufficiently to
give a fair idea of the water sup
ply of the county and the char
acter of it, and the reports will
be official. This is what we
have needed always, and now
that we have a chance to get it,
there should be the greatest
alacrity in cc-operating. Don't
forget the meeting.
Casto Comer, who has been
making his home with Allan Mc
Gillivray, waa badly injured this
morning by a horse falling upon
him. Both doctors were sum
moned from here. We are un
able to learn the extent of his
injuries at time of going to press.
Bob and Howard Ogilvie are
having a preliminary hearing be
fore Justice Róberson today, the

and assault with a deadly weapon
and the latter on a charge of as
sault and battery. This grows
out of a fight at a dance last fall,
in which these boys and Ward
Turner engaged.
