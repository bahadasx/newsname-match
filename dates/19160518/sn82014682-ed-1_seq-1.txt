' Hawaii's plantations have large and
in some cases enormous profits which
can be paid out in dividends this yea
without in a single trase reducing the
amount they carried over from 1915

At the present selling-price of stocks
there is hardly a sugar plantation in
the islands which does not offer a
remarkably good Investment for peo
ple in Hawaii looking' for profitable
as well as safe securities.
All of the plantations which figure
prominently In ther stock exchange

and extras than' they have paid or an

Another development that was
deemed of some Importance was the
meeting of the Pacific Mill directors
to determine upon the matter of re
ducing the par value of the stock of
that company from $100 to $20. Fa
vorable act on was : taken and stock
holders will now be allotted five
shares of the new stock for each share
of the old. This will mean a more
ready market in the trading for a
stock of smaller value!

have not yet made their, appearance,

RAPID TRANSIT
George M. Collins, city engineer, is
this afternoon presenting the city's
plans for the improvement of Kala
kaua avenue to the directors of the
Rapid Transit Company, which are
holding their monthly meeting.
The city proposes that the traction
company move Its tracks to . the cen
ter of the roadway and is willing that
a temporary construction be used and
a temporary road be laid, pending the
arrival of the time when the company
will want to double track theKavenue.
As the light material purchased for
the proposed Pearl Harbor extension
is on hand it is hoped by city officials
that the transit company will agree
to the scheme in order that the im
provement of the avenue may be
started soon.
WHARF AT FORT
KAIIIEHAMEHA
Plans and specifications have been
drawn up In the office of the con
structing quartermaster, Hawaiian De
partment, for the Construction of a
big modern concrete wharf at Fort
Kamehameha. Bids taill be opened on
the wharf May 31. (
Two hundred feet u length and lo
cated at the end of an earth mole that
projects 600 feet Into the water, the
big wharf will furnish a model place
for the largest mine-planters plying
these waters to He alongside and take
on or discharge cargoes.
Estimates mace on the wharf place
its cost at $25,000. It will be made of
reinforced concrete and modern In
every detail with superstructure de
signed after the most successful
wharves on the Pacific coast.
Spring hung fenders, with two
springs to each pier, capable of re
sisting a pressure of 20 tons for each
two incnes of movement from a ves
sel nosing against them, will form
one of the main features of the wharf.
With the piers 10 feet apart the wharf
will have a resisting force for every
10 feet of 80 tons for each two inches
that the vessel exerts.
The wharf itself will be set upon
piles driven into the soil far enough
to furnish a solid foundation, and em
bedded in concrete which will shut out
all borers and water. This, it is saia,
will make them last for centuries.

War Department Issues Orders
to Keep Soldiers in the
Service
"Waahlngtorv May 17, 1916.
"Evans, Honolulu.
- Suspend until further orders fur
lough and transfer to army . reserves
after, three years' service under the
provisions of Act of Congress approv
ed August 24, 1912, in case of all erv
listed men under your command, ex
cept members coast artillery organi
zations. "McCain."
The foregoing cablegram from the
War Department to Brlg.-gen. Robert
K. Evans, given out today at head
quarters, came as a surprise to many
army men and is considered ofmuch
importance.
As stated by It men now eflowed to
enter the reserve list at' the end of
three years' service will be kept in
the army until further notice.
Whether this will .continue long
enough to keep men for more than a
year after they are eligible to enter
the reserve is not known yet, but it Is
stated at headquarters that no men
will he discharged at the end of the
fourth year unless orders to that ef
fect are received.
Army officers are reticent as to of
fering reasons why this order has
been given, but the general Impression
to be gained from them Is that the
present disturbed conditions in Mex
ico have beyond a doubt been the
chief reason for the order.
It is presumed that the Coast Artil
lery Corps is excepted from the re
strictions placed by the order because
they are not mobile troops, and it is
mobile troops that Uncle Sam wants
right now. That portion of the war
regulations to which the cablegram
refers is as follows:
"That any enlisted man at the expi
ration of three years continuous ser
vice with 6ilch organizations either
ander a first or any subsequent en
listment, upon his written application
may be furloghued and transferred to
the army reserve In the discretion
of the secretary of war. in which
event he shall not be entitled to re
enlist in the service until the expira
tion of his term of seven years."
As men are enlisted and discharged
daily from the American army It Is
difficult to place an estimate upon the
number of men on Oahu that this will
effect
In addition to the construction of
the wharf proper, the mole that pro
jects out Into the water will te lined
with concrete on the side where the
boats will tie. ;
