GERMANY WARNS
ALL CONSOLS
Admonishes German Officials
and Citizens Throughout
United States to Scrup
ulously Observe Ameri
can Laws.
Washington, May 18. Gorman',
through Count von Bernstorff, has in
structed all German consuls In the
United States to admonish German
citizens In their districts to scrupul
ously observe American laws. This
was done in an effort to end various
alleged violations of American neu
trality. The ambassador acted on Instruc
tions from the Berlin foreign office.
The action was announced today in
this official statement from the Ger
man embassy:
"In consequences of cases which
have occurred of late the German am
bassador has sent Instructions to all
German consuls In the United States
to strongly Impress upon German citi
zens living In their districts that it is
their duty scrupulously to obey the
laws of tho state in which they re
1 side."
It was said at the German embassy
that the Instructions were designed to
prevent plots, -or lawlessness on the
part of the German citizens. The Ger
man government, It was said, looks
with great disfavor upon any such
conduct
Illegal Acts Not Countenanced.
It was made clear that Berlin of
ficials want the United States and
its people to understand that thoy
have not countenanced any Illegal af
fairs with which German citizens, or
sympathizers In this country have
been connected.
Count von Bornstorff's instructions
were received last night and were for
warded to German consuls Immediate
ly. It was said that the Instructions to
German consuls were not the result of
any action by the United States. Ad
ministration officials thought the stop
might do much to relieve troublesome
conditions which have manifested
themselves almost since the beginning
of tho war.
It Is understood the German gov
ernment learning that public opinion
in this country was being affected by
activities of German sympathizers, de
sired to put ail ond to activities ob
jectionable to the United States.

I PLAN TO PREVENT
WAR MOT
Use of Military Compulsion by
a Group of Nations Kadical
Feature Debated at
Lake Mohonk.
PEACE RESTS ON FORCE
International Hague Tribunal
Has No Provision for fin
forcing Its Decisions.
Mohonk Lake, N. Y, May IS. Tho
use of military compulsion by a group
of nations to prevent war. which is
tho most radical feature of the plan
advocated by tho league to enforce
peace, was debated today before the
Lake Mohonk conference on Interna
tional arbitration. The proposition
was favored by Herbert S. Houston
and George Haven Putnam, Now York
publishers: and opposed by Dr. James
L. Tyron of Boston, director of the New
England department of the American
peace society, and Alpheus H. Snow, a
Washington. D. C, lawyer.
"Peace between nations," said Mt.
Houston, "Just as does peace within
nations, must rest on force. Peace
must be put on a war footing and Its
advocates must quit the forum for the
field, if need be, to fight, not to urge
war, but to establish peace."
"The International tribunal at The
Hague," Dr. Putnam said, "had the
weakness of presenting no provision
for the enforcement of the decisions
nf tlio fr-iVuinnl Tn ovnrv r?MUTort
state decisions are now arrived at in a
court Thefce decisions would have
little value tipwever, Jjlnaalntalnlng
'peace hrlheeommunlUes'unfess, back
of the authority of the court, stood
an organized force."
Dr Tryon's view was that the Unit
ed States might wisely co-operate, if
need be, with other nations to use
force for the preservation of public
safety In a specific emergency like
the Boxer rebellion but be In a posi
tion to withdraw when it considered
the purpose sufficiently fulfilled, with
out taking the obligations of an alli
ance with all Its possible entangle
ments. '
"An arrangement for international
police," he declared, or any kind of
plan for an International 'force other
than for temporary purposes, presents
very grave difficulties."
Mr. Snow's conclusion was that the
plan of the league to enforce peace
was Impracticable and dangerous for
many reasons, chiefly because It pro
poses to use Joint instead of united
force and provides no executive to de
termine and direct tho force.
