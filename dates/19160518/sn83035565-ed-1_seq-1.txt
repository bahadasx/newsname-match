The attendance at our Sunday

ance and interest, each Sunday,
A very appropriate and pleasing
Mothers' Dy program was ren
. dered at the close of the study
', period, consisting of essays and
declamations, and a quartette
composed of Mrs. Sylvan Jenkin
son, soprano; Miss Stella Wright,
alto; C. M. Wright, tenor; and
Grover Browder, bass; sang that
beautiful, soul-stirring song; en
titled "Tell Motherl'llBeThere,"
in'a very impressive manner ancf
many were the tears shed by the
audience. We wish to commend
the thought expressed in the pa
per read on the subject, ' 'Moth
ers as Home-Makers." The spea
ker emphasized the fact that the
mother is the greatest factor in
the home life. She alone can
create and formulate the atmos
'phere of the home. What IS home
i
without a mother? What a bles
sing it would be to the world to
day if all womankind could real
ize the responsibilities and duties
resting upon them. But it is a
sad fact that there are many wo
men in this age who do not com
prehend the great purposes of an
, all wise Creator, or at least their
actions and mode of life do not
correspond to the thought.
The rubber flip-jack in the
hands of the small boy is becom
ing somewhat of a nuisance and
we think ought to be dispensed
with before something serious
takes place." - :

"Because of lack of training,
he Arabians are extremely poor, ' '
said Dr. Paul W. Harrison, re
cently a medical missionary' in
Arabia,- who spoke in the chapel
of the Ohio State University Wed
nesday. "I have been told,".Dr.
Harrison continued, "of one Be
douin who wore one garment for
five years, and when it began to
drop off he bought a new one,
but put it on without removing
the old one."
The Arabians, according to the
speaker, are by no means an infer
ior racebut lack of opportunity
has handicapped them. For this
reason, it was shewn, missionary
workers in this field were neces
sary.
In discussing the character of
the country, Dr. Harrison went
on to say that the seasons are de
termined by the great numbers
of insects which prevail at differ
ent times. The fly season comes
first, during which time the flies
are so thick that more can be
found, on one square foot than
can be' found anywhere . else on
four square feet The following
season is marked by the coming
of the fleas.
The Arab in spite of his many
inconveniences remains cheerful,
and even the poorest of them
feels a contempt for othet men,
whom he regards as infidels.

Protect the Birds.
It has taken mere than twenty
years of steady work by the Na
tional Audubon Society to dem
onstrate the economic value of
the birds to agriculture, and the
result is seen in our state laws
protecting song birds and the fed
eral laws protecting migratory
game birds. Incidentally, bird
sanctuaries have been established
in several places. Henry Ford's,
near Detroit, and Avery Island.
on the gulf coast, given by Mrs.
Russell Sage, are noteworthy.
Several state preserves have been
set aside for the same protection.
The bird club movement strives
to save the birds, with objects
both economic and esthetic. Bird
club organizations have taken
arm hold in several of our larg
est cities, and have brought a
bout increased attractiveness to
parks and residential sections hy
reclaiming the wild native birds.
The methods include planting
trees and shrubs suitable for nest
ing places and bearing acceptable
fruit for food, and the provision
of drinking fountains for bird use.
The methods have proved suc
cessfuland does anything add
more charm to outdoors in a city
than bird songs? St. Louis Post-

until there were but 48. When

TOLEDO LIQUOR HAH
SHOWS IGNORANCE
Says License Money Hslps Sup
port !i3 Sthaols.
Toledo, O (Special.) Quite a
flurry has been caused in this city
this spring because the children in
the public schools have been writing
essays on the evils of the liquor traf
fic. A nKrnbcr of older persons have
taken up the discussions in the news
papers. A liquor dealer In writing to
a local paper says In his letter of pro
test: "I am a liquor man and proud of It,
with sej ' children in our public
schools; w..d the only effect these es
says have is to prejudice these chil
dren against those of'saloon men. 1
wonder how many of these same chil
dren realize they are procuriiig an ed
ucation from the taxes derived from
the business they are so it;norantly
trying to condemn."
This saloonkeeper, and all others
who do not know, should understand
that not a dollar of the liqiinr tax in
this state is expended on the schools.
Not only Is this Toledo saloonkeeper
ignorant, butthere are ffjK engaged ,
In the business who franb'iy proclaim
they are pioud of the traffic.
CHILDREN OF DRINKERS
ARE HANDICAPPED
Juvenile Court Official Elves
Interesting Experience.
Dayton, O. (Special.) Marie J.
Burcb, probation officer in the Juve
nile court of Montgomery county, has
rendered an opinion based on condi
tions as disclosed by the cases
brought before that court. In the let
ter this probation officer says:
"At least 75 per cent of the cases
brought into this court may be attrib
uted directly or indirectly to lntoxicat.
ing liquors as the cause. Almost
every family with which we have to
deal are in the habit of having beer
at home and allowing the children to ,
drink It. The children of parents ad
dicted to the use of Intoxicating liquor
Pie usually incorrigible. This view,
I may say, is based on the observa
tion of children whose parents are
moderate drinkers. In the home of
the confirmed drunkard the children
degenerate rapidly."

Movln Picture Magazine Makes Prop
.:tion to Liquor Dealers.
New York. (Special.) Following
the action of the National Liquor Deal
ers' association In adopting resolu
tions protesting that the moving pic
ture industry untruthfully magnifies
barroom scenes, thus prejudicing ita
patrons against the liquor traffic, li
quor Journals have opened fire on the
movies for what Is termed their Injus
tice to the saloon interests. The
Photoplay Magazine for May come3
back with this shot, which staggers
the whole liquor camp:
"We hereby offer to run a set of pic
tures fully descriptive of any big
thoughts, high ideals, public spirited
actions, or types of sp'endid manhood,
which the saloon business, may have
evolved or will evolve."
The offer, needless to say, has not
been accepted.
Brewery Did Not Want Drinker.
Cincinnati. O. (Special.) The
daughter of John Moerlein, president
of the Moerlein Brewing company ot
this city, in suing her husband for di
vorce, charges among other things
that because ot his drinking proclivi
ties her father dismissed him from
service in his brewing company. The
brewers complain when other lines of
business and industry refuse jobs to
men who drink. They want others to
take care of the derelicts made by
booze.
