PROF. LYNCH'S WORK
A Tribute by Sam M. Jor
dan, the Noted "Corn
Man," to the Educator
The Springfield (Mo.) R.
ii 1 l i -
can of May 7, 1910. says:
A tine I riliut-tci the life mid
work of Prof. W. II. Lynch, visit
or fur the Springfield state nor
inal school, is paid in a letter re
ceived by the veteran educator a
few days ago from Sam M. Jor
dan, lecturer and agricultural
authority for the Missouri state
hoard of agriculture. Everybody
knows Sain Jordan as the "corn
man" and to him belongs the
ci edit of doing more toward
bringing the state into the front
rank in agriculture probably
than any other living man.
The letter compares the career
or Prof. Lynch with that of Hen
ry Wallace, the famous agricul
turist, who "died in harness."
Mr, Jordan expresses the be
lief that Prof. Lynch, too, will be
found pursuing his work of bet
tering educational conditions in
bis state when the final summons
conies. This is Mr. Jordan's
tribute to the pioneer educator
or the Ozarks:
"I want to assure yon that I
am always glad to bear from
you, as every word that ever
came to me about yon was a
kindly word. What greater thing
could one ask? If one has been
busy during a long life time,
spreading only sunshine in the
lives of others, what happier
thing can anyone do?
"The finest thing I know, or
any man can know, was some
thing about the life and death of
Henry Wallace, 'of Wallace's Par
mer. The common good of the
human race was always upper-
uist .in id thought- and .actual
He worked eveiy day and when
eighty useful years hud passed
he 'died in harness'. He did not
want to outlive his usefulness for
a single day. His life and death
were both among the grandest I
have ever Known.
"It seems, from what I have
seen and known of your life, no
less can be said. The sunshine
you have scattered, the lives you
have helped, the kindly word, the
jolly laugh, and the warm grip of
the hand, with a soul too full for
language, it seems to me, is all
one could wisli for in himself or
a friend.
"If the death sentence comes
to you first, I fully expect to
hear that you, too, died in bar
ness! But eighty years are all
loo short for a life like yours, for
you do us all good. You have al
ways handed us a good word
when a good word was due. In
oilier words, 'do it now' has been
a rule of action with you, and we
cannot forget
"If with pleasure you are viewing,
Any work a man is doing,
If you like him, or you love 4iim,
tell him now;
Don't withhold your approhn
lion
Till the parson makes oration,
And lie lies with snowy lilies
o'er his brow.
For no matter how you shout it,
He'll not really care about it.
He'll never know how many tear
drops you've seed.
If you think some credit due
him,
Now's the time to slip it to him,.
For he cannot read bis tomb
stone when he's dead.
More than fame and more than
money
Is the comment kind and sun
I'.V,
The hearty, warm approval of a
friend.
For it gives to life a savor,
Makes you stronger, braver,
(lives you heart and spirit to
the end.
If he's earned your praise be
stow it,
If you like him, let him know it,
let the words of true encourage
ment bo said.
Do not wait till life is over,
Ami he's underneath the clover,
For he cannot read his tomb
htoue when he's dead."

A capacity audience tilled the
opera house Friday evening to
atlend the graduating exercises
of the class of 1910 of the Mans
tield high school.
The invocation was given by
Rev. J.W. Needham of Seymour,
after which Miss Alice Toroble
sou ably rendered a piano solo
Valse Caprice by G, Bachmann.
Cecil Brazeal delivered the
welcome address in a manner
calculated to make all glad that
they were present.
Miss Mabel Coday 's essay on
"The Community Center" was a
strong plea for the use of the
school buildings for th:il pur
pose where better means were
not available.
"Down Where the Daisies are
Blooming" was sung by a quar
tet composed of Misses Mabel
Coday and Mabel Hoover and
Wade Rippee and Cecil Brazeal.
The class poem was a produc
tion of much merit and was giv
en by Miss Mintie Avery.
Miss Opal. Hoover read a good
"Class H4tr-y."
"In the Palace of Dreauns"was
the title of a pleasing vocal solo
by Wade Rippee.
Miss Minnie Dennis' essay on
"The Future Rural School" was
in able expositions of her ideas
as to what conditions should ex
ist in this respect.
Miss Mabel Hoover read the
"Class Will," making suitable
disposition of all the property of
the class.
The "Class Song" was unique
in that it was composed by a
membpr of the class, and it was
sung with enthusiasm.
The address of the evening
was delivered by Superintendent
W.W.Thoinas of Springfield, and
was a masterly effort on. the sub
ject or character development
and a plea for the building of
good character. His discourse
was of a high order and yet told
so simply that none could fail to
grasp its import. Our people
were indeed fortunate in having
had an opportunity to listen to
Mr. Thomas.
Following the address, the
llowers and presents for the
graduates were presented by the
(lower girls.
The presentation of the diplo
mas was made by Prof. J.A.Hyl
ton. who desired to do so because
of the fact that this was his last
year in the schools here, a fact
which brings dee sorrow to our
people, and especially to the stu
dents. There was not a member
of the class who did not shed
tears as the professor spoke so
earnestly and to the point. His
services here have certainly been
productive of great good, not on
ly to the school, but to the entire
city, and he will be uiissea uy
school children and citizens alike
The benediction was delivered
by Rev. Needham.
Out of Town
"Out or Town" was the title of
i ha ninv iriven bv the Junior
class of theMansfield high school
in the opera house Thursday
evening. The juniors were hand
icapped by the fact that there
but six members of the class,
but they presented a highly
uleasinir and satisfactory play,
in a manner that elicited the
beartv amdause of the audience
All did their parts exceedingly
well and are to be commended
for their good work.

School Notes
Vacation has come at last.
Now what will the children
find to do?
A most happy and successful
year closed May 12.
Miss Osborn returned to her
home at Springfield Monday eve
ning.
The junior class and the high
school teachers spent. Sunday af
ternoou at Hartville and ate sup
per at the Findley spring.
Miss Gaskill's pupils counted
the tret.: -in the school grounds
very carefu.;y and found the
number to be 130 of all varieties.
Lynn Cantrell was the only
pupil in the secomd primary
room who attended every day of
school and was never tardy a
pretty good record.
On account of chickenpox and
measles the attendance in the
first primary room fell off con
siderably the last five or six
weeks hut it had been very good
until the children were attacked
by these contagious diseases.
Miss Ellis has the highest rec
ord for attendance for the entire
year of any of the grades. Her
average daily attendance for the
180 days was about 40 pupils,
nearly all of whom will be pro
moted to higher grades.
Eleven of the 13 eighth grade
students were promoted to high
school and will make up the ninth
grade next year. This is not as
large a number as there should
be but with the additional pupils
who come in from the adjoining
districts there will be a right
good class of sophomores in 1916
-'17.
School work was continued
regularly all last week until Fri
day afternoon. The pupils in the
different rooms sang songs, ci
phered, or had a tiri v r pro
gram until the last quarter and
then came the last assembly per
iod. It was a trying time for
pupils, teachers and parents to
close the day. The seniors and
a few others found excuses to
stay away and so avoid the close
which came with singing "God
Be With You Till We Meet A-
gain.
Several of the teachers will at
tend summer school at. Spring
field. Until it opens about June
1 Miss Hoover will remain in
Manstield. Miss Gaskill will rest
at her home in the country near
here, Miss Ellis will spend the
lime with her mother at New
Grove, Mr. Fultington will find
something to do in his garden
and tomato patch, Miss Osborn
will be at home with her mother
in Springfield and Prof. Hylton
will stay here and take care of
the strawberries and make some
repairs about his property.
Elected at Mountain Grove
Mountain Grove made good
when the Board of Education e
leeted Friday night two of the
teachers from Mansfield to posi
tions in the school there for next
year. Miss veril Kills, who lias
made such a splendid record
here in the intermediate grades,
was selected for a place of the
same kind and MissCloe Osborn,
who has been principal of the
high school for two years and
won not only the esteem of the
pupils but also of the patrons as
well, was elected to the position
of history teaching. Miss Os
born has made special prepara
tion in history and all the people
here will be pleased to know she
has such desirable work and that
she and Miss Ellis will be no far
ther away than Mountain Grove,
next year.

ALUMNI BANQUETERS
They Have Enjoyable Time
Saturday Other Notes
of Interest
The annual alumni meeting is
always the most joyful occasion
of the commencement week and
this year the program was the
best one ever given. The Initia
tion of new members was in
charge of the class of 1914 and
they had provided ample means
for trying the candidates both
mentally and physically. The
motto of the class this year is,
' Not at the top but climbing"
and the ceremonies emphasized
the "climbing" most effectively.
Each member was marked with
the number 14, given a good bait
of angle worms and taught how
to kiss the Bible when an oath is
taken besides roller skating and
other amusements. After the
initiatory work was over several
contests were engaged in, all of
which afforded fun for everybody
At the proper hour refreshments
were served, diseriptions of
members present were written
and read for others to guess the
person described, letters were
read from absent": members,
speeches were made and before
anyone was aware of it tiie clock
struck time to go home (it being
Saturday night) and there dis
persed about 75 of the represen
tative young people of Mansfield
from one of the most enjoyahlp
events one can hope to occur as
often as once a year.
Prof. Hylton has taught longer
in the school than any other
teacher, so far as the records
are known. He has been at the
head of the school nine years,
though not in succession. Mrs.
Ora Rippee Riley taught seven
rears ntceesHivelv and Mrs Bee
tha Jackson Ream and Miss Ger
trude Keller each were here six
years in succession. Miss Gas
kill taught four years aud part of
another. E J. Knight and Arthur
Arnold were here three years
each. Miss Dora Newton was a
teacher here four years. V. F.
Bland, C.A.Stephens, E.B. Hens-
ley, Foster Rippee, John W.
Stephens, Cloe Osborn and Veril
Ellis have each been in the school
for two years.
Some very interesting letters
from absent members were read
Saturday night. Among the num
ber was one from James Bell,
Violet Craig, Lola Henson, J. R.
Deckard, Paul Hopper, Eudora
Barlow and C.W. Evaus.
The teachers who have been in
Mansfield since the first class
graduated in 1905 are more wide
ly scattered and fewer of their
addresses known than the grad
uates of the school themselves.
Four of the teachers for next
year are members of the alumni
association. They are Mrs. Nor
ma Newton, Horace Fullington,
Mabel Coday and Jewell Hoover.
Eighty of the members of the
alumni association graduated un
der Prof. Hylton, 13 -the first
class under C.A. Stephens, ami
one under L.D. Curty.
About 40 of the alumni includ
ing the wives and husbands of
members had a picture made
Sunday morning.
Every one of the 94 alumni is
living and the address of all but
one, Harry Hogboom, is known.
The 1912 class has the distinc
tion of being the largest of all
the classes 14.
The smallest class is that of
1910 one pupil.
There was no graduating class
in 1909.
