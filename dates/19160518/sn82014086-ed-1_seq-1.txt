OLD FORM OF GOVERNMENT
IN IRELAND A FAILURE
Premier Asquith Convinced
New
8ytem is Necessary.
Dublin, May 17. 11.05 v. m. (Premier
Asquith has reached the conclusion
from impressions gathered during his
Irish visit that the old form of gov
ernment in Ireland has had Its day.-
The "Associates Press" learns from
sources in the closest touch with the
premier that Mr. Asquith s conversa
tions and conferences have convinced
him that the future government must
be conducted . on an entirely different
system. The prime minister has taken
care to learn the ideas and views of
many persons other than those-then
purely official and the persons have
offered greatly - varied sugsreattona.
None of these, ' it is believed, could
be adopted .in its entirety, but it is
thought they might be welded togetfc-.
er to form, a proposal to lay before
the cabinet. The premier himself
does not know what form his propo
sal will eventually take, and, in fact.
it win be ruiiy developed only at tha
cabinet meeting. His Belfast visit
gave a good hint to the premier that
the- Ulsterites would not accept a di
rect proposal implying home rule. But
It is believed that they might be in
duced to enter into a concerted plan
which could possibly be -arranged to
meet their most serious objections.
Mr. Asquith will visit Cork tomor
row to get further opinions. He has
not, however, arranged to see the poli
ticians: Most of these with whom ha
will confer are of the literary and
educational-classes.
