siderable feeling was manifested,

not be a party to such a scheme to
defeat Supt. Haynes, leaving the

Supt. Haynes urged action for the
best interests of the. school; saying,
that 40 teachers wanted something
definite, so they would know how
to make their plans for next term,
so did Councilman Terxywbb
thought it better to pick now while
the picking was good and before the
teachers had accepted other places.
Councilman Smith was of the same
opinion and aiso corroborated Mr.
Terry in saying that this was the
time designated 60 days ahead
to elect the teachers; ' High Point
is interested in tJiisapatt-reiBark
ed Mr. terry ana ane wants ioruow
what we are going to do and it is
right to know it.
There was considerable more talk
and idignatiou- expressed on the
streets than at the meeting over the
affair.
Ex-mayor Tate wanted Hamilton
street sprinkled and the council ask
ed him to see if another sprinkler
could not be procured at a reason-
3blc price?
The request of P. C. Mclntyre to
allow him to turn out the light in
front of Staley's store one hour each
night ?o that the slides would show
better on the screen on top of this
building, was declined upon motion
of Councilman Terry.
TUESDAY NIGHT'S SESSION
Councilmen Terry and Smith ab
sent, Mayor Pickett, Councilmen
Davis and Alexander present.
Conncilman Davis made motion
that Manager Lyon be re-eiected
and his salary be $2,000 a year
carried. Mr. Davis also made
motion that the salary of the super
int( ndent of the city schools be
$1,700 a reduction ot $300; carried.
Councilman Davis made motion
that an additional 50.00 be allow
ed city tax lister Pickett, making
$150.00. Manager Lyon thought
amount not enough and Davis
amended motion to make amount
$200: carried
The other city officers hold offer
to next bi ennial election.
H. A. Moffitt wanted a street
opense up in San Diego through his
procerty and city manager Lyon
vvill look into the matter.
The council adjourned to meet
again in an half hour so as to "com
ply with th" law" iu order to take
up the reve-me budget.
It is rum-.u-ed that the opposition
to Supt. Haynes have their eyes on
Prof. Ci-uwell, a former superinten
dent, who kft here under similar
conditions nov being worked against
Supt. Haynes.
And we say there are no factions
the schools, churches, social and
fraternal societies, are full of them
the very institutions that should
be free from them accbiding to their
Principles. . .

Not to Compete
The Elks of High Point, who have
me uuviugs oup ior tne Dast
I two years for best appearance and
number in the parades at the State
meetings, decided not to compete
this year owing to the distance and
inconvenience of getting to little
Washington. Had the local lodge
won this year it would have been its
property for good but in that case
would have offered another one for
the same purpose, because the Elks
of High Point are liberal and broad
in their views.

Makers of Fornitiire Face
Higher Prices
That the prices, of all raw materi-
als going inter the manufacture of
furniture will continue to rise, with
the end nowhere in1" in sight and
consequently the. price of the pro
ducts must advance, was theuri-
Janimous opinion expressed by those
wno aitended the semi-annual meet
ing of the Southern Furniture Manu
facturers association in. Winston
last week.
Seventeen attended from High
Point arid there were about 50 at
the meeting in all. The sessions
are described as being highly profit
able to furniturs manufactucers.
At the banquet given Wednesday
night at the Zinzendorf there were
three speeches. Mayor Eaton made
one of his typical addresses of wel
come that was greatly appreciated.
Charles Lee Chandler, the Southern
railway representative in South
America, spoke as did Robert E. Belt,
of tne rederal Trade commission.
Both of these speeches were filled
with much food for thought
After the set speeches there were
a number of important talks by
manufacturers. One of the most
interesting of these talks was made
by Frank Wineskie, of High Point.
Mr Wineskie said that on account
Of no imports and large exports the
price of glass ywas still soaring.
Henry Ford is in the market for six
million-square feet of glass and no
one will take the contract. The
automobile business is using more
glass now, it is said, than the mirror,
industry.

Buy the High Point Produces
Your attention is directed to the
ad in this issue of the High Point
Milling Company, a home institution
which manufactures the very best
flour to be obtained and wt feel that
it is the duty of every loyal citizen
not only to uphold local enterprises
but support them especially when
they can buy the same goods for less ;
money. Pso town can oecome great
in the true sense without the peopie
get the community spirit of buying
everything that is possible at home.
We know from experience that the
flour of this mill is good and the
people of High Point should use it.
Fire at Greensboro
Greensboro suffered a seripus fire
loss last week when the McAdoo
hotel was burned, together with
C nyers and Sykes drug store, the
offices of physicians, etc. The same
afternoon the, McCormick and the
Gold residences and another house
were destroyed. A regular epidemic
of fires for the Gate city.
Dalton is the Han
It is to High Point's advantage to
send Carter Dalton to the legislature.
Hft has a big majority of the voters,
committeemen "and town officials
here endorsing him as well as fine
endorsements in other parts of the
county and without a doubt he is
High Point's choice and who High
Point wants the other part of the
county will most likely endorse, so
we should remember this in the
primaries.

cial Club are: President, Tom D. Gil

SIMPLE JUSTICE DEMAND
DED BY CITIZENS
High Point Will Not Tolerate Sach
Underhand Methods Uncalled for
Proceedure Nine-Tenths of the
People Indignant 1
At a meeting of the City Council
Tuesday night three councilmen, the
only. ones present entitled to a vote,
deliberately reduced "the salary of
High Point's superintendent of
schools from $2,000 to a measlev
$1,700 and did it so quickly that, a
camera could hardly have caught
the action of the vote, It was a
direct slap in the face of the best
superintendent High Point has ever
hafd and equal to any in the country
a man filling a $5,000 job for a
little more than ope third this
amount, a man whose intellectual
forces must feel . repugnant at such
action on the part of his antagonists,
who apparently put personalities be
beyond community good. ' J '
The good fathers" and mothers of
High Point and the two thousaud
school children cry out for fair play
for a man whom they love and who
is performing. such a great service
to this.city and community.
At the meeting Monday night the
opponents didn't have time to go in
to the election of school teachers, a
simple courtesy due them, yet the
very next night they had time to
reduce the superintendent's salary,
and when it came to education took
a fling at it by reducing an already
too small a salaryand then the
boast is made that the city has sav
ed money this term ye goods and
little fishes saved money-yes at
the expense of the poorly paid teach
ers who have toiled and labored to
train, our children intellectually,
morally and physically shame on
such a boast. It has no champions
here with the citizens, . y
, Is. High Point going to stand : for
this? -J-vy-- -r.:..

were W ) P. Pickett, G" ayoir) S, L.
Davis and A,.E. Alexander. Council
men R. B. Terry and C.;D. Smith
were absent.: V, ,
Is High, Point going to measure
character by dollars and cents? Can
High Point put up with this state of
affairs until next May?
Supt. Haynes the vast majority of
High Point's citizens are with you. :
Surely this is enough to convince
you of their love and loyalty and
take ourr advice and see it our.
There will be a way provided, some
how.
Generally speaking Mr. Hayne's
salary should be $2,500 at least and
the editor of this paper will be glad
to be one of 25 men (and there are
scores who would do it) to make up
the difference of $800. because we
know his worth, because we know
that the people are with him and
the action of a few doesn't reflect
the sentiment of any portion of the
people.'
If the best teachers are wanted
make the salaries large enough to
get them.
If the curriculum is not , high
enough add an eleventh gradel
And then the most exacting, the
few grumblers will be perhaps satisfi
ed. But there will hardly be any
money in the treasury at the close
of the sphool year.
The superintendent can only go
so far as the council wiii let him on
salaries and improvements
