The residence of Fred Ross,
fourteen miles south of Meade
was completely destroyed by
fire Tuesday afternoon, Just
hbw the fire started is not known,
but was- first discovered in a
closet on the second floor. By
tbe time neighbors arrived it
was beyond control, and with
the exception of a few articles
removed from the first floor, tbe
house, (seven rooms,) furniture,
and clothing-were soon an ash
heap. Mr. Ross estimates his
loss at about $2,000, of which
$800. is covered by insurance.
The main part of the building
was built about a year age. A
new residence will be commenc
ed within the next few weeks. .

Departed
Joseph McDonald, 65 years
old, who was proving up a claim,
twelve miles south of Meade,
died May 15tb. His sou, E. II.
McDonald, of Hutchinson, ar
rived in Meade Wednesday . and
took tbe remains to Inman.
Tbe deceased bad been in this
county about two years.
We might have bad a bead end
automobile collision to report,
but, fortunately for tbe occu
pants, both cars were stopped
when within a hatr's breadth of
each other. This all happened
in Meade, one day this week, and
all because of "jay driving."
We didn't witness the proceed
ing, but this is the' account as
reported to us: One car, an out-
of-town Studebaker, was com
ing west on Carthage Ave., and
was keeping to the right; tbe
other, a town car, was going
south on North Fowler Aye.,
keeping to tbe left. At Tbe
First National Bank corner both
cars turned, the . Studebaker
north and tbe town car east, and
then each driver saw what was
about to happen. Meade is in
need of an ordinance regarding
vehicles, with a "keep to tbe
right" section in it.

Motor Cars in Kansas
England and France are the
only countries outside of the
United States which have as
many motor cars as the people of
Kansas own. Curtis Meyers, ..
motor car license clerk for the
secretary of Btate, received 1 cen
sus of the motor cars of the
world. It was compiled by one
of the motor journals of the east
and it is asserted that the list
contains a complete census, of.,
the cars owned in the different
countries December 31, 1915.
Most of the countries have , a
license and tag system that en
ables accurate figures to be giv
en out. ... - , '
Kansas has 85,537 motor cars, '
This is sixty per cent more cars
than owned in tbe entire Domin
ion of Canada. France was list
ed as having a total of 98,400 cars
th Til fit t K a v.ir n..mtnu
i j n-
( bad 71,455 and England 276,000.
, Kansas had more: cars, licensed
-January 1 than wasiglveVsa a
total for all of Germany on that
date and Kansas bas purchased
12,000 cars since that date. ;
The United States is credited
with' two and one-half million cars .
of all types and . styles. The
United States figures are prob
able nearer being a guess , than
any of the countries of Europe
as so many states ' do, not have'
license laws that give an accurate
account. .Some states grant a
license to a car and when once
granted never bas to be renewed.
Others do not require licenses
at all. So it is practically impos
sible to get accurate check. on
tbe number of cars in this coun
try. ; But of the states which have
licenses Kansas stands clear at
tbe top on tbe number of cars
per capita. Kansas now has one
car for every 18.6 persons now
residing in tbe state, a car for
every four families under , the .
ordinary rule of estimating tbe '
number of families.
Preston, the three-year old
son of Mr. and Mrs., Ira Scott,
has a badly bruised right band,
as a result of getting it too close
to the wringer last Tuesday
wb'le bis mother was doing the
family washing. No bones were
broken.
