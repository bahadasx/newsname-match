LIRI’OR INTERESTS CONDEMN the
MOVIES.
The picture show —there are some
12 I,UOO in this country, it is said —is
diverting thousands of dollars every
day from the saloon. It is more pop
ular than the “poor man’s club,”
and the liquor interests are declaim
ing against the “movie menace.”
Not on financial grounds, however.
They declare that the films represent
ing “conditions surrounding the re
tail liqitor trade are preposterous and
untruthfully magnified—such display
having misleading effects upon the
public mind, particularly upon the
minds of women and children.” In
reply to this complaint, voiced by
the National Liquor Dealers’ Associa
tion and the liquor press, the Photo
Play Magazine offers “to run’a set of
pictuaes fully descriptive of any big
thoughts, high ideals, public-spirited
actions, or types of splendid man
hood, which the saloon business may
have evolved or will evolve.” It’s
now up to the liquor men. Here’s
an opportunity to present to the pub
lic the good points of the trade and
to use a most effective advertising
medium. I
j The Ring I
I By —= |
] H. M. EGBERT £
(Copyright, 1910, by W. O. Chapman.)
"An<i you start tor Wes>, Africa to
morrow?'
llransome felt that the question was
like an unwritten doom. He looked
at Mary Starr in the moonlight as they
stood outside Colonei Starrs conserv
atory.
Hransomo had kimwn Mary tor live
months Colonel Starr, In whose regi
ment lie was now a captain, had taken
a liking to the young man when they
were posted in Malta, and had Invited
him to his home in England. Now
Bransome, with the acting rank of
major, was to leave for West Africa
to put down the rebellion of the Kru
tribe In the recesses of the forests.
And he loved Mary.
But he knew that she was engaged
to Lionel Travis, the political agent
among the Krus, who had made his
escape to the coast after sanguinary
lighting.
Yet they loved, and love was strong
er than honor at that moment. They
gravitated toward each other, and
stood looking at each other, not dar
ing to speak lest they betray them
selves.
“If I meet Travis —” began Bran
some at length.
"Yes?” Her word was like a ca
ress,
"What shall I tell him?”
Mary took the solitaire from her
finger. "Give him this,” she said soft
ly-
Bransome, incredulous, clasped her
In his arms and their lips met. "Y’ou
love me, dearest?" he murmured.
"I have loved you since wo met. It
is wrong, but it is better than a mar-

rlago that shall wrong Lionel and my
self, too.”
Before Bransome departed it was
understood that they were engaged.
And Lionel Travis’ ring reposed m
Bransome's pocket to be handed to
the agent if they met Bransome
would affect ignorance of the contents
of the little box. It was a cruel mis
sion, but there was no way of getting
a letter to Travis, who might be in
any part of the coast.
Bransome sailed the following day.
and, fifteen days later, arrived with
his regiment at the coast town. All
the interior was in a ferment. The
regiment was sent up hastily to the
base, where it halted while the pio
neers cut roads through the forest.
And it was there that Bransome met
Travis.
He was to accompany the column
as political delegate to the loyal tribes.
The two men, who know each other
greeted each other warmly, though
Bransome naturally showed something
of constraint. Travis lunched in the
mess, and they smoked their cigars
together afterward. When Travis rose
to depart to his quarters Bransome
spoke of Mary Starr for the first time.
"She asked me to give you this,” he
said, handing him the little box con
taining the ring.
"Thanks!” said Travis Indifferently,
and slipped it into his pocket.
The column started a day or two
later, Travis accompanying it. Often
th 1 men exchanged words. Bransome
would look curiously at Travis, but ho
could gather nothing from the agent s
Inscrutable countenance.
There was, however, little time for
thinking. On the sixth day the ene
my’s stronghold was sighted. The
messenger who went forward with a
summons to suirender was met with
defiant shouts from the negroes. Half
an hour later the seven-pounders
opened Are on the rebel stockade.
A fusillade from elephant guns fol
lowed, but few of the attacking party
were hit. Presently the guns ceased;
a breach had been made In the strong
walls, built of hardwood logs and al
most as resistant as cement and mor
tar.
The regiment spread out in line.
Bransome ran before them, waving his
sword. "Advance!’ ho shouted.
Then he saw Travis beside him in
his civilian clothes. The agent’s
white solar helmet made a splendid
mark for an enemy. “Go back, you
tool!” Bransome shouted.
But Travis ran beside him, and
Qrar.some had no time for argument
The whole line followed, with fixed
bayonets, roaring behind him. 'the
bullets churned among the trees and
cut splinters from the boughs. Show
ers of leaves came down.
The yelling, defiant Krus manned
the walls of the breached stockade.
The assaulting party was compelled
to form into column to mount the
breach. Ami now the enemy displayed
its secret resource, nothing lens than
an old brass ship's gun, which might
have done good service in the sixties,
and was none the less effective here.
A roaring detonation, and grape shot
burst among the British troops. They
fell In heaps, cut down by the well
directed (barge.
But the gun was, of course, not a
quick-firer, and had to be reloaded.
The troops closed up. Bransome, who
had by some miracle escaped un
siathed, put himself at their head
again. "Advance!” he shouted.
And again he was conscious of
Travis in his white helmet, cool and
smiling, beside him.
It was a mad rush toward the walls.
Just as the foremost man set foot in
the breach the cannon roared again.
The files were swept away. And
again Bransome found himself unin
jured.
"Now, boys!” he shouted, amazed to
find that he was still alive.
The attacKing party, which had re
coiled, heaped one man against his
neighbor, and, the dead all about,
rushed forward, cheering. Like a cata
ract the khukl-clad column swept over
the breach, driving the dogged negroes
before them, pinioning them with the
bayonet. In a moment the fort was
carried.
From hut to hut the flying Krus
were pursued. They fell in writhing
heaps, their own gun turned against
them. For perhaps half an hour the
bloody struggle lasted. Then the Brit
ish were in possession of the village.
Bransome stopped; he had forgot
ten everything in the excitement of
the battle. His sword was bloody, and
yet he could not remember having
struck down a man. A trickle of blood
was running down his face. He limped
from a slug in his leg that he had
never felt.
“Where s Travis?" he demanded ol
his surviving captain.
The agent could not he found. Yet
It was Travis who represented the
majesty of the British raj, and it was
Travis who must interview the trem
bling old king, now a prisoner in his
oWn mud hut, guarded by a sullen, de
fiant chief wife, and a younger one.
who held the royal red parasol over
him.
Bransome went back, searching
among the fallen. Travis was not in
the town; he was not anywhere within
the fort. Bransome came upon him
at last just outside the breach. He
had been struck down by a dozen
slugs from the brass cannon the sec
ond time the weapon was discharged.
Travis lay under a pile of dead Krus,
but he was alive. He recognized Bran
some.
Bransome hailed the stretcher
bearers and had two men place him
upon a stretcher and carry him Into
the town. They brought him to the
king's hut. and Travis pronounced
sentence. The king was to go In exile
to the coast, to spend the last of his
days there.
The surgeon came up, looked at the
agent and shook his head. "There may
bo a chance for him," he said. "Got
him out of here. Put him in a hut that
hasn't been used. There’s smallpox
everywhere among the Krus.”
Travis did not catch smallpox, but
it became clear, after a week of de
lirium, that he was dying. Hi;; mind
grew clear toward tho end. lie mo
tioned to Bransome to open the little
satchel he carried with the govern
ment papers.
Bransome did so and found ir it the
little box containing Mary’s ring. He
looked at Travis and saw that the
agent’s eyes were fixed upon it. He
put it In Travis' hand.
With fingers that almost falh d him
Travis slowly pulled off the cover and
held up the diamond ring. It xas In
congruous to see the gem sparkling
In tha dying man's wasted hand.
Travis motioned to Bransome to bend
down.
“The engagement ring 1 gave her,”
he whispered. "She Is as true as
gold, old man. 1
“Yes. ’ agree Bransome.
“We were to have been m .rrled
when this cursed business was over.
Now we shall never marry. 1 want
you to marry her, Bransome. Y ou’re
about tho only man that’s fit for her."
Bransome winced and tried i ot to
show the emotion on his features. But
Travis was toj far gone to see any
thing except the face of Mary Starr
that floated before him.
“I wrote to her telling her low t
longed for hei In the silence of the
brush,' Travis whispered. “1 said I
had looked at her photograph ai.d her
mementos again and again. I wanted
something else to bring her vividly
before my eyes. And she —she sent
me this. Nothing could have en a
truer pledge of her love. A girl doesn't
like to part with her engagement ring,
Bransome.”
“No," Bransome agreed.
And the Irony of the situation struck
Into his soul. Travis had lived In the
belief that his sweetheart wa: true
to him, and he would die not knowing
what the return of the ring meant.
They burled him the following dawn
under a cairn of stones. And Bran
some, having done his duty to the dead,
allowed his thoughts to turn toward
the living. The past seemed obliter
ated—at least It seemed to he sym
bolized In the gem that sparkled In
the dead hand under the damp soil
of Africa.

IN PATHETIC WRECK
WRITER TELLS OF SEEING RUINS
OF REIMS CATHEDRAL.
Beautiful Structure Damaged Beyond
Hope of Repair, Though Parts of It
Miraculously Escaped the
General Destruction.
A correspondent of the London
Standard, visiting the French front
gives his impressions of the war-dam
aged cathedral of Reims. “The spec
ter of the cathedral looms up out of
the mist with Turneresque effect as
we lop the Heims chain of hills,'' he
writes, “and in ten minutes we are in
front of the statue of Jeanne d’Arc,
which stands unscarred over against
tho wrecked porticos. The Maid of
Orleans seems to have bequeathed to
her stone image tho charm she en
joyed against the shafts of war, as the
street leading up to the square and
the walls of the 'Lion d'Or' are pitted,
when not badly torn or altogether
shattered by shell splinters. Thirty
feet high around the basement, the
masonry of the cathedral is shielded
with sandbags, but not one of the
statuettes that fill the interstices be
tween tho pilasters seems to have
escaped.''
The Interior, he says, la filled with
an indescribable cold and entering It
is reminiscent of Egyptian buried tem
ples. Swept into many heaps are
what the verger calls “tears of lead .'
These are the settings of the stained
glass windows. Only one of a triple
set of colored windows remains al
most Intact over the entrance to the
sacristy. In the center aisle opposite
the principal pulpit there is also a
crucifix that none of the shells has
touched. “All of the rest is more
or less ruin," says tho correspondent.
"This is the more extraordinary be
cause in the roof there is a hole
scarcely larger than a man’s hand;
but the shock was sufficient to reduce
the interior to chaos." One instance
of escape from wreckage is de
scribed as a freak that is almost a
miracle. “Facing a huge chasm 20
feet square in the north wall in an
inner passage,’’ says the writer, “is a
lovely bas-relief of the visit of the
Magi, framed in a pure Gothic arch
way, as fresh looking as if it had
just left the hand of tho sculptor of
live centuries ago.’’
“Before we leave,” he continues,
“we are taken to tho “museum,” as it
is styled—a forlorn collection of res
cued debris. It is curious to find here
a hundred or two of the heads and
limbs missing from the outside stat
ues and statuettes. They look as if
they had been guillotined by the Ger
mans; perhaps it is because the necks
are the slenderest parts of the images,
but it is almost tragic, although they
are but stone. Here is the ’Sourire
de Reims,’ the famous woman’s head
that stood over the north door. It was
noised abroad that it had been smug
gled away and sold to an American
millionaire, but there Is no mistak
ing the ‘Smile’ as It lies, brown and
chipped, on a bench —both eyes and
the nose gone, and only the under
lip curving upward. It is as If the
features had been sliced Off with a
knife.”
What Scenario Writers Are Paid.
In the American Magazine Walter
Prichard Eaton has an article on the
moving picture Industry In which ha
says:
“No more than three years ago
many scenario writers were getting
$25 a week, and they were expected
to turn out a picture every seven
days. Pictures purchased from out
side were paid for correspondingly,
or at even lesser rates. Bear In mind,
also, that no royalties were (or are)
paid. Do you suppose for a moment
that any man with a real talent for
story telling would give a second
thought to motion picture writing un
der such conditions?
“Times are better now because the
keen competition has forced up
prices, but the returns to the authors
are still in ridiculous disproportion to
the salaries of the actors and the to
tal cost of the production. An aver
age scenario writer may now get from
SIOO to S2OO a week. At such a scale,
young men of talent may possibly be
secured.”
Activities of Women.
Great Britain has 17 women who
are peeresses in their own right.
One hour for lunch each day must
be allowed all women workers in New
York state.
Barnard college girls have taken up
jiu Jitsu, the ancient sport and de
fense used In Japan.
An army school of cookery, at
which women instruct, has been in
augurated for tho training of military
cooks who will serve at the front with
tho British army, and already 13 wom
en are engaged in this work.
Miss Hoyl Skinner of Georgia has
been appointed by the department of
agriculture to demonstrate farming to
women of the South.
Sophia L. Burke of Detroit has
given $25,000 for the establishment of
a home for the reclamation of chil
dren with criminal tendencies.
Making Paper From Grass.
The department of agriculture Is
experimenting with wire grass as a
source of supply for pulp in making
paper. It is reported that the result
ant paper has proved thoroughly sat
isfactory, but that more bleaching
powder must be used than in the case
of poplar stock,
