to call at this office during the
week was a dry land terrapin.
He most have had an early start
for he was scratching at the door
before work time on Wednesday
morning. We do not know what
office he is running for. On his
back was scratched the following
inscription, "W. 1910", so we at
least know when he started to
run. If he proves as sharp witted
as terrapin in Uncle Itemus'
story, some of those who consider
themselves good runners had
better look sharp.

New Candidates
The first man to start in the

It physical statue, native ability,
p* pularity and an early start
are qualifications that will count
in this race, then "B. J.," as he
is familiarly known, will run a
good race.
Hon. J. O. Rivers, of Mt. Oroghan,
this week takes the step
necessary to return to the as \
8enibly. Whether Mr. Ilivers
will have an opponent we do not
yet know. It is generally conceded
that he has made good,
and the voters do not need to be
told what to do with an officer
who has made good.
Mr. Roland II. Vaughn enters
the race for the office of Auditor.
Mr. Vaughn is probably not

WE SHOULD ACT NOW!
When the American army went down
to Cuba to clean things up politically and
otherwise after the Spanish-American '
war, it found that Havana was one of
the worst yellow-fever pest holes in the
world. 9
The army surgeons learned that the mosquito was to j
blame. They declared war on the mosquito. The weapons |
in tkio ?????? "?Ax ~
iino ??ai nci c nui bwaiiurs. i nere was out one weapon? i
sanitation. \
! The city was cleaned with absolute thoroughness. Mosquito-breeding
swamps were drained. Lakes and streams
were covered with oil. Now Havana is one of the world's
most healthful cities. The lesson taught fifteen years ago
has been applied steadily by the Cubans.
In this country the house fly bears about the same
relation to typhoid fever and dysentery that the mosquito
bears to yellow fever in the tropics. Both insects are dangerous
germ carriers.
This community ought to rid itself of flies. The means
of doing so are the same as those employed in ridding Havana,
the Canal Zone, Manila and New Orleans of the fever
mosquito. But the job will not be nearly so big.
Our citizens should call a meeting
\ by the middle of next week and form an
cjsSi^ organization to conduct the spring fly
-swar. There is no time to be lost. Once
warm weather arrives the flies will multinlv

The Courthouse Sermon
A large congregation of men
heard an excellent sermon last
Sunday afternoon in the Courthouse,
preached by the Rev. J.
L. Tyler.
The subject discussed was
"Your Church, Your Home, Your
Self." Knowing that he was
speaking to many men who seldom
attend church services, the
preacher endeavored to prevail
UDOI1 them to attend the rhnrr.h
and Sunday school of then
choice and to support all its in
stitutions.
Since the organization in Chesterfield
of a loeal branch of the
Equal Suffrage League, the question
of votes for women has been
a live one in Chesterfield. As
Mr. Tyler is known to be opposed
to the innovation, it was predicted
that he would take this
occasion to express his opinions
' clearly.
On this subject, Mr. Tyler
said, in part: "I am not in favor
of woman suffrage, but 1 am in
favor of woman's rights. There
are those who say that woman's
pla^e is ;ti the home. I agree
with that, but there are some in
this town who say her place is
away back in the kitchen doing
household drudgery. Where is
your place? OtT on the bank of a
stream fishing, under the shade
of a tree, or downtown sitting on
a goods-box spitting tobacco
juice at a crack?
"I believe in woman's rights.
I believe she lias the same right
to loaf, drink liquor and cuss
that a man has.
"there was a petition downtown
against woman suffrage
and it was enough to make any
woman laugh to see a man too
drunk to stand alone signing
this petition and another too ig
norant to sign his name, yet
anxious to have his name written
dewn as opposed to giving
votes to women.
"I am opposed to votes for women,
but women have rights
that ought to be respected. I
am a woman's rights man."
The sermon closed with a
strong appeal for clean living.
D. F. Nicholson, Farmer
Some interesting information
h 1 it ,n f flip sni'cPBa rif Mr 11 1<"
Nicholson, of Mt. Croghan, as a
farmer has been received at this
office.
For thirty-three years Mr.
Nicholson has been a prosperous
farmer. During that time In
has spent but $.*'80 for work
stock, which is evidence of th ?
fact that he knew how to take
care of his farm animals.
During that time he has
bought but one peck of seed corn
and very little if any corn ior
feed. He always has feed to sell.
He has plenty of potatoes and
never buys seed potatoes, lie
finds there is tnore profit in selling
seed than in buying them.
Because of the fact that he
has always raised an abundance
of everything to eat on hisprei
ises, both for stock and and his
lamily, he was able to held hi1014
and 1915 cotton as long a<
he wished.
lie has raised a large family
and has set an example in farming
that many would do well to
emulate.
A Cotton Oil Mill
At a recent meeting of the
Chestei field Warehouse Co., it
was decided to look into the
question of establishing a cotton
[seed oil mill in <'hestertield,
Messrs. J. O. Rivrs, Charley
Rivers and .J. T. Hurst are the
committe appointed to investigate
the matter.

I hereby forbid all persons
treaspassing on my land. Cutting

Fair for Each Township
The first step in an excellent
move for the benefit of Chesterfield
County will be taken this
afternoon when Major W. J. Tiller,
Miss Stella Minis and C. L.
Ilunley, esq., will meet, a delegation
of progressive Mt. Crog
han citizens in tl.at wide-awake
little town and organize the first
one-day township fair. That Mt.
Croghan is to be the leader in
this fine move is probably due to ,
the activity of Mr. 1*. M. Ther
re11, who has recently adopted
that town as his home and has
gone to work in earnest to aid in
its development, \
It is hoped that this organization
will inspire other towns, ]
such as Page land, Jefferson, Mc- <
Bee and others to do likewise.
In this way a series of one-day |
township fairs could be held all ,
over the county just prior to the j
County Fair at Chesterfield. t
' The benefits to the townships ;
and to the county as a whole to t
he derived from this kind of cooperation
would be very bard to .
estimate. t
A keen rivalry among farmers t
of a community in an effort to j
produce the hest exhibits and ^
between the several townships v
for the best fair is sure to be a (
great stimulus to agricultural t
improvement.
If the good pe?.pie of other 1

mass meetings to discuss
this subject, Mr. lluuley, County
Fair secretary; Miss Minis,
home demonstration agent, and
Mr. Tiller, farm demonstration [
agent, will gladly address these i
meetings and assist in organizing
the local fair. r
Now let the progressive citi .j
zens of each township get together
and boost, for a township fair. ,
