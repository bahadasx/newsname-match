Residents of northern Montana
have won theri fight against the
Great Northern for Sunday train
serivce belore the Montana Railroad
commission, which made an order
yesterday for such service to be fur
nished within twenty dlays.
The order directs the Great Nor
thern to operate local passenger
trains each way daily between Mon
dlak and Glasgow; between Glasgow
and Havre; between Havre and Vir
doln,
Flag stopps are ordered as fol
lows: Trains Nos. 3 and 4 at Oowe
go and Nashua; train No. 4 at Dod
son; train No. 2 at Saco to let off
passengers from all points south and
west of Havre, and to pick up pass
engers for all points east of Glas
gow ;train No. 3 at Hinsdale and
Warl.and.
In a dissenting opinion, Chair
man Hall says: "I concur in the or
der of the majority i nthis case, as;
far as it goes, but feel that in addi
tion thereto, train No. 2 shoud stop
at Harlem, Dodson, Hinsdale and
Wolf Point to let off passengers
from points west and south of Havre
and to pick up passengers for points
east of Culbertson where said train
stops.
The argument of the Great Nor
thern that Montana is not entitled
to Sunday local service because such
serviec is not given in North Dakota
or Minnesota is answered with fig
ures obtained from the railroad com
mission of North Dakota, which
compared with Montana figures,
show the Great Northern earns
$571.23 more per mile on passenger
travel in Montana than in North Da
kota, while its freight earnings are
$1,496.58 greater per mile in this
state than in Dakota.
Adducing other figures, the com
mission shows that intrastate pas
senger earnings of the Great North
ern in Montana exceed the Northern:
Pacific earnings in the sum of $92,""
807.09, but on interstate passenger
earnings the Northern Pacific ex
ceeds the Great Northern in the suo1n
of $598,374.62.
"The obvious deduction of these
comparisons," says the commnissiof,.
"is that the defendant has a greant,
ticket purchasing population, strir.
ly interstate, than the Northern I'
cific. Most of these persons evideie;
ly have no choice of comlpe iii
routes. However, on interstalo b:1:
ness where choice of routes exist:;
a much greater degree, th di.
ant dos not get the passenger bu:
ness. The defendant is itslf I,
sponsible for this condition."

Last :i il Joe Brown purchased a
l utnou)o, (i eOs for spring planting
and h.i:i i, men to bury thenl ini
the grop id until spring, when they
would taken up an d set out. A
short , ago lie secured the ser
vices a ; other man to do the work
and lioN up the ground around his
a home il this cituy and among other
e things hIe had a numbler of round
n holes dug for the trees. At the prop
er time Joe marched like a major to
s the grave of the trees to have them
e taken up and after digging for a
e half day it was discovred the trees
were never buried, but instead they
were sold by the dorkman last fall.
It is hard lines, but goes to demon
strate that Joe should h~ave done the
work himself.
WOMAN'S (CLUB
A large meeting of the Malta Wo
man's cluub occurred at teh home
of Mrs. J. F. Kilduff on Saturday
afternoon, with a number of guests
also present. Plans for celebrating
Memorial day were discussed, and
the proper disposal of the State
Scholarship Fund was given lengthy
consideration. As the Malta High
school is now accredited, one girl
graduate may be sent to college
through the endorsement of the
club, and steps are being taken to
1 bring this about. Mrs. Kirton was
given charge of this commission.
The members of the Malta club
who took part in the district meet
ing in Havre, repeated their parts to
the local club. This included mu
sic by Mrs. Hall, a report of the dis
trict by Mrs. Parker, secretary of
the Fifth Dsitrict, a paper on the
"New Civic Spirit," by Mrs. Thomp
son, and short talks by each of the
thirteen delegates in attendance.
Mesdames Roy Lee. Blumenthal,Kil
uduff and Tressler, served a dainty
luncheon, and the meeting adjourn
ed until May 27th. when Mrs. Ed
wards, Mrs. Murray and Miss Simus.
will be hostesses.
