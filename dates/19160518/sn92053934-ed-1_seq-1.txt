Paris, May IS, (5:45 a. m.) The at
tack by the Austrians against the Ital

has gradually extended to the entire
Autro-ltalian front, is being followed
here with close attention. It is gen
erally Unlived in military circles that
the great Austrian offensive which has
been expected for some time past has
at last U.-frun.
No importance is attached to the
falling back of the Italians' advance

British Start
Inquiry Into
Irish Revolt
London, May 18. (Noon.) Hear
ings were opened today by the royal
commission which, under the presi
dency of Baron Hardinge, was ap
pointed to inquire into tie Irish re
bellion and the conduct and degree of
responsibility of the military and ex
ecutive in Ireland in that connection.
The first witness, was Sir Matthew
Nathan, who resigned as under-secre-tary
for Ireland after the outbreak of
the rebellion.
Sir Matthew read a long statement
in which he outlined the formation of
the National Volunteers, which he said
were raised as an answer to the or
ganization of the Ulster Volunteers.
He also read a manifesto issued
by a majority of the provisional
committee of the National Volunteers
opposing the active participation of
Ireland in the war.
Of 180,000 members enrolled previ
ously, Sir Matthew said, not more
than 11,000 adhered to the loyal sec
tion. The original provisional com
mittee and the vast hulk of the mem
bers declared themselves loyal to John
Redmond and the Irish parliamentary
party.
The witness also read a manifesto
issued by the disloyal section, in which
it was said that henceforth Ireland
should provide for its own defense by
means of a permanent army and a
trained force of volunteers. The man
ifesto also intimated a purpose to re
sist by force any attempts to compel
men of Ireland to join the British army
prior to the establishment of a free
national government of Ireland.
Sir Matthew Nathan testified that
fear that the military service act would
be applied to Ireland induced a num
ber of the national volunteers to join
the Sinn Fein movement, so that at
the beginning of the disturbances
there were 16.000 hostile volunteers
throughout Ireland, of whom 3,000
were in Dublin.
Considerable sums of money, be
said, had been coming from America,
the funds being used for the purchase
of arms and the printing of seditious
papers and leaflets. It is estimated,
he added, that 16.000 pounds sterling,
had been received from America and
paid into Dublin banks from the mid
dle of September, 1914, to the follow
ing April, when the money was with,
drawn. After that it was not found
possible to trace the methods of the
receipt in Ireland of money from the
United States.
The police estimated before the out
break that the volunteers had about
1,800 rifles, pistols and other firearms
and that there were 825 rifles in Dub
lin. Explosives had also been found
in different parts of the country, he
said.
Baron Hardinge asked Sir Matthew
why no action had been taken to pre
vent drilling under arms,
i "Because we were afraid to enforce
the act," said Sir Matthew.
"We deterred practically for politi
cal purposes."
When asked what action had been
taken to report this to the then chief
secretary for Ireland, Augustine Bir
rell. Sir Matthew declared the chief
secretary was fully aware of it
The witness also admitted that he
knew, as also did the chief secretary
that women were being trained to look
after wounded men and that sham
fights for the taking of Dublin castle
were being held.
THE WAR TODAY
The Austrian offensive on the
Italian front is being pushed vig
orously and the Italians have fal
len back in the southern Tyrol be
fore the Austrian onset.
In the fighting abont Verdun the
French have now partly ousted the
Teutons. Paris today reports the
rapture of a German fortified po
sition on the northeast slope of the
hill.
On the German side an attempt
was made to capture a redouht at
Avocourt, on the French left Hank
hot the assaults are declared to
have been repulsed with heavy
German losses.
Other operations in the Verdun
reciou. according t the Paris aft
ernoon bulletin were confined for
the mot part to a successful raid
hv the t rench on German trendies
north of Hill 27, west of II ill 301
and to henrj tiring hy the artillery,
which was active all along this
front during the night.
The Austrians continue on the
offensive against the Italians in
the region of the head of the Gulf
of Triest. Within the last few dajs
the Austrians claim to have rap
tured 6.200 Italians and more than
thirty guns by infantry attarks in
Tyrol. Home report that a num
ber of attacks by the Austrians
against Zegnalorta were repulsed
with heavy casualties, the bodies
of numerous Austrians tloating
away in the river Adige,
The repnlse of another Austrian
attack in the Sugana valley is al
so reported hy the Italians. The
lighting on the French and Bel
gian fronts has consisted chiefly
of bombardments northwest of
Verdun.
Air combats have become fre
quent again on the western front
several German aircraft having
been brought down by llritish and
French aviators. In one of the
raids American aviators fighting
with the French army under the
title of the Franco-American Hy
ing corps took part in their tirst
foray as an individual unit.
The fighting along the northern
end of the eastern front has born
in favor of the Russians.

BERNSTORFF ADVISED
Count Passes Word to Con
suls To End Breaches
of Neutrality.
Washington, Way IS. Germany,
through Count von Bernstorff, has
instructed all German consuls in
the I'nited States to admonish
German citizens in their districts
scrupulously to observe American
laws. This was done in an effort
to end various alleged violations
of American neutrality.
The ambassador acted on instruc
tions from the Berlin foreign office.
The action was announced today in
this official statement from the Ger
man embassy:
"In consequences of cases which
have occurred of late the German am
bassador has sent instructions to all
German consuls in the United States
to strongly impress upon German citi
zens living in their districts that it is
their duty scrupulously to obey the
laws of the state in which they re
side." To Prevent Plots.
It was said at the German embassy
that the instructions were designed to
prevent plots or lawlessness on the
part of German citizens who might be
disposed to engage in such. The Ger
man government, it was said, looks
with great disfavor upon any such
conduct and desires that they shall
not engage in any undertaking in any
way outside the law.
It was not disclosed whether spe
cific cases have been brought to the
attention of the German government
but it was made clear that Berlin of
ficials want the United States and its
people to understand that they have
not countenanced any illegal affairs
with which German citizens or sympa
thizers in this country have been con
nected. Count Bernstorffs instructions were
received last night and were forward
ed to German consuls immediately.

The work of the convention was
perfunctory, being simply to ratify the
action of the electors at the state-wide
primary in their selection of delegates
to the Chicago convention in June.

Flood Bill; Is
Up to Senate
Washington, May IS. Advocates of
flood prevention legislation for the
Mississippi and Sacremento rivers
were hopeful today of early action by
the senate on the bill which the house
passed last night by an overwhelm
ing vote. The measure would appro
priate $45,000,0000 for the Mississippi
and $5,600,000 for the Sacremento. This
is contingent upon the Mississippi
valley interest contributing an amount
equal to one-half of the Mississippi
appropriation and the California, au
amount equal to the Sacremento ap
propriation. It was brought out dur
ing the debate in the house on the bill
that the Mississippi river project
would make it possible to reclaim at
least fifteen million acres of land and
the Sacremento project about one mil
lion acres.
NO MORE JURORS
FOR ORPET CASE
Waukegan, 111., May IS Two hours
of questioning veniremen in the hope
of speedily filling the jury panel in
the trial of Will H. Orpet, the college
boy accused of murdering his former
sweetheart, Marian Lambert, was
fruitless today.
Man after man, summoned on the
special venire of one hundred, re
plied with convincing firmness that
he had formed an opinion in the case
from what he had heard and read
which would disqualify htm from be
ing a fair juror.
When the afternoon session began
the second special venire of one hun
dred was in court and the prospect of
filling the jury box looked as distant
as when the trial began.

AN AMERICA
ISCONVICTED
IN REBELLION
Jeremiah Lynch Is Found
Guilty of Part in Revolt
by Court MartiaL
London, May IS, (4:35 p. m.) Jere
miah Lynch of New York has been i
tried and convicted by a court martial
in Dublin on a charge of participating
in the Irish rebellion. The sentence
was to be promulgated today but no
word has been received by the Amer
ican embassy here as to what sentence
was imposed.
The news that Lynch had been con
victed by a court martial was received
by the embassy from the American
consul in Dublin. Previous to this the
last news the embassy had of Lynch
was that under the defense of the
realm act he was prohibited from leav
ing the five-mile zone of Dublin. This
provision as a rule only applies to
hostile aliens but can be extended to
friendly aliens. It was extended to
Lynch as he had been making trips to
western Ireland.
Lynch was a resident of Dublin for
some time.
Jeremiah C. Lynch is a naturalized
American citizen, it was said today by
his friends in this city. Up to four
years ago when he returned to Ireland
to engage in the insurance business
in the city of Cork he was prominent
in Irish circles here as president of
the Philo-Celtic society and as a mem
ber of the State Celtic league.
Two years ago he returned to New
Y'ork and spent six months here as
representative of the Gaelic League
from Ireland and has since been in
Ireland as representative of the Gaelic
League from the United States. He is
about 40 years old and first came to
this country 20 years ago.

in a statement commenting upon th
"vital interests of the United States,"
being involved in the wire tapping ac
