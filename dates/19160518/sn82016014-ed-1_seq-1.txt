Amsterdam. May 18. Three hun
dred thousand Austrian troops con
centrated on a 3 5-mile front, are
striking against the Italian line in the
Tyrolese Alps in the moat determined
Austrian offensive against Italy of the
war-
Th official dispatches transmitted
from Vienna contain no hint as to
the exact nature of the operations.
Several Berlin military critics inti
mated today that the Austrians are j
developing a great offensive and are
bent on the invasion of northern Italy. ;
The fighting has spread eastward
from the Adige river valley across the
Alpine peaks and rocky plateaus. The
Italians have been driven southward
on a five-mile front extending from
Piazza to the upper Astico valley. The
Vienna war office claims the capture
of Zignatorpa, south of Rovereto,
though the Italian war office reports
the repulse of heavy Austrian attacks
at this point.
Bodies Float Down .River.
The losses in the three days of se
vere fighting have run well into the
thousands. The Italian official dis
patch reports that many enemy bodies
have been swept down the swiftly
flowing Adige river.
The military critic of the Berlin
Morgen Post, declares that the Aus
trian victories apparently are of more
than local significance.
"For some time it was known that
heavier fighting was beginning along
the whole front. said the Berlin crit
ic. "The entire front from the Iaonso
to Lake Garda Was been set in action.
The Austrian attack in Tyrol has ap
parently developed on a wide front.
"Austrian troops have achieved in
this one victory more than the Italian
forces have in a year for the Italians
at no time have succeeded in cap
turing Austrian positions on a 25-mile
front."
Italians Quit Advance Positions,
Paris. May 18. The attack launch
ed by the Austrians against the Ital
ian front in the pouthe-rn Tyrol which
has gradually extended to the entire
Austro-Italian front is being followed
here with close attention. It is gen
erally believed in military circles that
the great Austrian offensive which has
been expected for some time has at
last begun. No importance is attach
ed to the falling back of the Italian
advance lines which is considered a
strategic move as they were not strong
enough to resist an attack on a large
scale.
Italians Fully Prepared.
French military authorities are sat
isfied that the Austrians are doomed
to failure. It is pointed out the Ital
ians have made every possible prepa
ration for just such an attack as the
present anr that the mo.st powerful
defenses engineering skill could devise
have been prepared on the Asia so
plateau and in the mountain? north
west of Arsiero. It is on this line that
the Italians are expected to make
their real stand in event the Austrian
continue to push their offensive.
Heavy Fighting at Verdun.
Paris. May IS. .Several attacks
were made by German troops on the
Verdun front last night in an effort
to capture a redoubt at Avocourt. The
official statement of today says the
Germans were repulsed each time, and
that they lost heavily.
French troops after severe fighting
captured a German fort on the north
east slope of Hill 304.

NATHAN GIVES INFORMATION
Former Secretary for Ireland
on Stand Today.
Testifies Government Knew of
Coming Rebellion.
London, May 18. From testimony
developed today at the hearing
opened by the royal commission to in
quire into the Irish rebellion, it ap
peared that the government had re
ceived advance information of prepa
ration for an uprising with help from
German sources. The testimony was
given by Sir Matthew Nathan, who
resigned as under secretary for Ire
land after the rebellion broke out.
The government had received ad
vices, said Sir Matthew, that an at
tempt would be made to land arms in
Ireland from German submarines;
also that rifles had been purchased
from Irish soldiers on home leave,
while others had been taken into the
country in passengers' baggage.
The former under secretary gave
this testimony in the course of a long
statement outlining the formation of
the national volunteers, of which he
declared a small section only had
shown themselves disloyal, the leaders
of the section having issued a mani
festo declaring that Ireland should
provide for its own defense and j mli-i
eating an intention to establish a free
national government of Ireland. ..The
leaders of the movement he saidV
rected their efforts to securing more
rifles and ammunition and to storing
as large an amount of material as
possible. This was where the real
danger came from, he added, as it was
felt that an attempt at disarmament
might lead to bloodshed.
Decided on Arrests.
The executives in Ireland being in
possession of sufficient evidence of
the association of the movement's
leaders with a foreign enemy, contin
ued Sir Matthew, had decided upon
their arrest and were discussing the
matter on April 24 when the rebel
lion broke out. He defended the fail
ure of the government to disarm the
volunteers on the ground that such
action might have alienated the sym
pathies of many loyal volunteers, and
added: "There are 25,000 Irish Cath
olics enlisted in the army.
Feared Military Act.
The royal Irish constabulary was
considered strong enough to cope with
disorders, the witness continued. Sir
Matthew Nathan declared that the
fear , that the military service act
would be applied to Ireland induced a
number of the national volunteers to
join the Sinn Fein movement so that
at the beginning of the disturbances
there were 16,000 hostile volunteers
throughout Ireland, of whom 3,000
were in Dublin.
Considerable sums of money, he
said, had been coming from America,
the fends being used for the purchase
of arms and the orinting of seditious
papers and leaflets. It was estimated,
he added, that 16,000 pounds had been
received from America.

BONDS INDEMAND
Commissioner Wasson Has
Long List of Applicants
For the Coming Issue of City
Paving Securities.
REQUESTS REACH $150,000
Denomination of $100 Is Prov
ing Great Favorite.
All Banks Will Tate Part In
the Distribution.
Finance Commissioner "Wasson is
receiving: daily many requests for tbe
bonds which the city will issue for the
paving to be done this summer, from
Topeka citizens. A long list of those
who have made requests for the bonds
lies in the desk of the commissioner
and a review of the list reveals the
fact that the requests -come from citi
zens in all walks ' of life and the
amounts desired range from $100 to
$5,000.
This deluge of applications was
stimulated by the article on the first
page of Tuesday's State' Journal calling
attention to the opportunity of. the
small investor.
One noticeable fact was the large
number of those desiring the 'Taby
bonds, or those in denominations of
$100. This class represents the shop
workman, clerk, office boy, fathers
who want to start their little one with
a small savings account, and the small
merchant.
The grand total of requests made,
which included many prominent busi
ness men, so far is close to $150,000,
and indications are that the entire is
sue will be absorbed "over the coun
ter" as it were, before the date set for
final issue arrives.
Many women investors are on the
list and this class usually asks that
The $500 bonds be reserved for them.
All of the banks and trust com
panies in Topeka will receive an allot
ment of the bonds, which bear interest
at the rate of four and one-half per
cent and are not subject to tax. except
the federal income tax. It has been
the practice, for the past few years, to
place the city bonds in the hands of
one trust company, but this practice
will be abolished, it is stated, here
after, and every bank in Topeka desir
ing: some of the bonds will have al
lotted to them a certain amount.
Until the State Journal exposed this
old custom this week, it was practical
ly impossible for any bank to v handle
these gilt edge, desirable city bonds.
No company but the Prudential Trust
company handled them. The other
banks could not get them, unless they
were stamped "P. T. Co."; and that
was naturally not agreeable to the
other banks.
In this way each bank can serve its
own customers without the formality
of having to request a trust company
to issue to them the desired amount.
- The bonds will be ready for delivery
within the next sixty days, it is stated.
This tremendous demand means the
city jean place all these bonds at 4
per cent now, during the easy money
market and make the big saving of
of one per cent on all these bonds for
the full time of twenty years, or un
til they mature or are refunded.
Now's your time, gentlemen commis
sioners. The State Journal will take
$2,000 of them at 4 per cent; they are
better than gold dollars because they
are transferable like a five dollar bill,
and, mind you, draw interest.

That now famous great triumvirate
"Victor, Henry and Me" will at
least be factors in the Progressive na
tional convention in Chicago in June.
Henry J. Allen and Victor Murdock,
both of Wichita, may be the two dele
gates at large from this state, while
there is every indication ".hat William
Allen White, national committeeman
for this state, will be re-elected if the
Progressives vote to continue business
at the old stand.
With the faces of three national
characters on the Kansas delegation,
this state will be a real factor in the
national gathering of Bull Moose pil
grims. White declares he does not
desire a place on the delegation to
Chicago. None tbe less, he will be on
the job.
Under the call of the national com
mittee, Kansas is accorded two dele
gates at large to the Progressive con
vention, while the Republican nl
Democratic calls gave the state four
delegates at large. A total of thir
teen delegates will be sent from Kan

White ttxlav -e-rm-pssetf the -belief
that 600 Proeressivea would- come tu
Topeka for the- state convention- next
Tuesday. He predicted that most or. i
the counties in the state would be rep- ;

for a full delegation to the convention. .
The recent Republican state conven- :

tics, when every county responded to
the roll call.
Expects 600 Delegates.
"1 believe nearly 600 delegates will
attend the convention in Topeka next
week," declared White. "The conven

Jiew Plan to Give All Reserve
Ships Full Crews.
Six Capital Ships Wanted in
One Year's Time.
Washington. May 18. The admin
istration has decided on a complete
change in its naval policy and will
i .shortly make a demand on congress
! for a big increase in the construction
program to be authorized a this ses
sion. President WHaon and his cabinet
consider that the naval appropriation
bill which will be reported to the
house by the naval affairs committee-
on Saturday is inadequate. Accord
ingly, they will seek to have the meas
ure amended in the senate to provide:
One. Six new capita ships instead
of four. These will be apportioned as
follows:
Dreadnaughts, 2; battle cruisers, 4.
Two. An increase in the enlisted
personnel of the navy of 20,000 instead
of 13.500.
Three. Authorization for the presi
dent to call out 10,000 additional men
in time of emergency.
Four. A naval appropriation of
$350,000,000 instead of approximately
$235,000,000.
$100,000,000 ImTesise."" '
The appropriation last year was
959,000,000. It was declared today
that the administration is willing to
assume full responsibility for the in
crease of $100,000,000.
The administration announced Its
national defense program for the navy
I last October. It comprised f s five
year building scheme which called for
a total of ten capital ships in the five
years. For the first year only two
dreadnoughts and two battle- cruisers,
were asked for and for the second
year two dreadnanghts and no -battle
cruisers.
It is now proposed to authorize th
first year the six capital ships origi
nally called for in two years, and it
is expected the total of ten will be far
exceeded before the five year period
expires. It was considered improbable
today that congress will adhere to the
five year building - scheme but will
provide for one year at a time.
Plan Foil Crews.
It was also tbe purpose of the ad
ministration originally not to provide
full crews for ships in reserve. It is
proposed now to have no vessels- in
reserve but to keep all in full com
mission. The increase of 13,500 enlisted men
to be authorized by the houne bill
would provide a 100 per cent crew for
every navy vessel built and building
except those in A he reserve and a 40
per cent quota lor me laiter. i nw
policy had been to keep 25 per cent of
a full crew on each vessel in reserve

Washington, May 18. The houss
naval committee today voted to aban

recommended by Secretary Daniels
and to build five battle cruisers, no
dreadnanghts and about 25 subma
rines provided by the current naval
