Market Gain'? Strength ;
aid Prices Go Higher
Ncs7 York, May 18. The New York
Evening Sun's financial review today
said:
The market experienced a distinct re
versal when prices, under tho lender
ship of rails and Reading common re
covered Bharply. There was nothing in
the way of special news to account for
the upward turn. What, tho Street
lacked in news in connection with the
movement in Rending was made up for
with rumor and conjecture. Tho issue
figured in a number of faciful stories,
in eluding the now familiar report of a
readjustment of its capital and segre
gation of its assets. This was varied
by a rumor originating in Philadelphia
that tho Rocki'tclli-r interests had tuk
en over tho Reading holdings of the
Into President Baer and also those of
tho Now York Central railway inter
ests. It is scarcely necessary to add
that there was no confirmation forth
coming for any of these reports but
this did not militate against the im
provement, for In a movement of this
kind stock always thrives best under
' 'mystery."
And for representatives in the state
legislature the following: Mrs. Uattie
Cameron, Mrsy W. A. Chapman (of
Woodburn), Marion Palmer (of Silver
ton), W. H. Egan (of Gervais) and
Frank Ward (of Salem)
Tho muin republican race on the state
ticket is that of Ben W. Olcott and
Charles B. Moores for tho nomination
for secretary o'f state. Fred G. Buchtel
and Thomas K. Campbell are putting up
a close race for the office of public ser
vieo commissioner nnd there aro four
candidates for the circuit judge nomi
nation in this district on the republican
ticket.
In the county race there are plenty of
candidates for representative and also
for district attorney while the county
clerk hns tho nomination nil to him
self. The contest for sheriff will prob
ably be the closest of any in this coun

Night and Day
London, May 18. Lieutenant Colonel
Nathan, under secretary for Ireland,
a witness today before the royal inves
tigation committee probing the Irish,
riots, testified that the British govern
ment knew days before tho revolt that
TriBh leaders planned an open rebellion.
The conspirators wero not disarmed, he-
said, for fear such action would enuse
greator bloodshed.

ing to Nathan, that the Germans would
co-operate with the revolt by launching
a combined aea, nir and land offensive
against the British.
The constabulary was warned an-l
patrolled tho Irish const night and day
to prevent landing of German aim.
Tho utter fniluro of tho rchol plan
and the capture of Sir Roger Casement
resulted from these precautions, Nathan
said.
Ho estimated the number of Irish reb
els at 15,200 including 3,000 in Dublin
They had l,K8rt rifles, and wore count
ing on having 20,000 more rifles and I,
