The announcement of the sudden
death of Mrs. J. D. C. Alcorn, of tf
Ave. C., came Monday as a great Itt
shock to the many friends of the a
family in Bogalusa. About six is
weeks ago Mrs. Alcorn, with her N
pretty 8 month old son, left for a N
visit with Mr. Alcorn's parents in sl
Huntsonille, Ky. For the past sev C
eral months she has not been in the tl
best of health, and it was hoped a
that the change of climate would d
improve her condition. Saturday 1:
morning Mr. Alcorn received a I g
message that his wife was in a criti- I
cal condition and he left for her n
I bedside, but while enroute, received t
I another message, announciug her t
death. s
Mr. and Mrs. Alcorn came to f
Bogalusa last October from Shreve- Ir
- port, La., where he was employed '
I with the Creosoting Co., and was j
made general foreman of the local j
plant. They resided with Mr. and
e Mrs. J. C. Lee for several weeks,
and later secured a home on Ave.
f C. Both were popular and had a
wide circle of friends.
Mrs. Alcorn was the daughter of
la Mr. Byrdie, a Chicago newspaper
man. who died recently.

stated that the Algiers Distilling tC
Co:. located in Algiers, just across
the river from New Orleans. used t
a' out 2.000 bushels of corn each ei
day, both yellow and red, the yel
law beind, prefered. Owing to the
good price paid for the proper
grade of corn, the convenient and
r mcdern facilities for shipping it, and b
I the fact that the corn would have
r to be shippel only a short distance
should he'an inducement for more
)farmers to raise corn. If any far.
mers have corn they should send
I flour or five pounds to the com
s panv, and have the chemist of the

In Outcome
The question of Sunday baseball
and motion pictures will be decided
by an election, and the married
ladies of the city will be entitled to
vote, and thereby Bogalusa will
establish a record of being the first
city in the state that will grant the
ladies the power of ballot. This
was the outcome of the three
neighborhood meetings held on last
Tuesday evening. A fair sized
crowd gathered at N. Bogalusa, It
Pleasant Hill and Columbia street. weel
The suggestion of the election was will
made at the North Bogalusa meet- Sun
ing by Mr. Jarvis and seconded and witt
approved by City Attorney Talley, dat

in order that every man and woman con
ii Bogalusa would have _ an oppor- exp
tunity of expressing their opinion. izn
