Prime Minister Hughes.
Mr. Hughes, prime minister of Aus
tralia, sent the following "Ansae Day"
message to the newspapers of the
commonwealth: "With a full heart,
the Australian nation today pays
tribute to Its heroic dead. We grieve
with those who loved them, but glory
in the manner of their death. This Is
the tribute they themselves would
moat have wished. For gladly they
faced and met death that by their
sacrifice their country and Its liberties
might be saved."

*If the Germans contemplate a
great offensive by land and sea
against Riga and the Dvtna,' said
General Cherflla today, 'they will
have to reinforce their forty-eight
divisions of infantry. These, spread
along a front of S80 miles, give less
than one man per yard, It is little
enough for defence. For an attack
ten men a yard are needed on the
line chosen.'

London, May 18. The
Chronicle .correspondent in

"Although the German com
manders dare not confess failure in
their Verdun enterprise by closing it
down and cutting off the losses,' the
stress of public interest here, now
altogether relieved of anxiety, is
passing to other fields, where events
of different character are preparing.
"Now that 800,000 of the best Ger
man soldiers have been lost on the
hillsides of the Meiise, a very grave
and dally aggravated situation races
the kaiser and his grand staff. The
tide has definitely turned. From
west and east their long-evaded des
tiny is closing in upon them.
'At no moment in the battle of
Verdun have they dared to bring
thither any unit from before the Brit
ish front. Other parts of the Ger
man front have been stripped of all
the superfluous strength, and the
force in Russia is similarly crippled
to feed this adventure. Since last
September at' least twenty-two divi
sions have been transferred from the
east to the west front, fifteen of these
coming from Russia direct, and five
or six other by ways of BeiUa or
other indirect way.

DEFENDS FAILURE!
TO DISARM REBELS
Only Small Section of Irish
Volunteers Prove Disloyal
to England.
liondon. May 18.—From the testi
mony developed at the hearing open
ed by the royal commission to in
quire Into the Irish rebellion, it ap
peared that the government had re
ceived advance information of the
preparations for the uprising with
help from German sources.
Testimony was given by Sir Matt
hew Nathan, who resigned as under
secretary for Ireland after the rebel
lion broke out. The government had
received advices, said 8ir Matthew,
that an attempt would be made to
land arms in Ireland from German
submarines, and also that rifles had
been purchased from Irish soldiers
on home leave, while others had been
taken Into the country in passengers'
Sir Matthew gave this testimony
during a long statement, outlining the
formation of the national volunteers,
of which he declared a small section
only had shown themselves disloyal.
Executives In Ireland, being in pos
session of sufficient evidence of the
association of the leaders with the
foreign enemy, had decided upon
their arrest and were discussing the
matter, April 84, when the rebellion
broke out.
He defended'the failure of the gov
ernment to disarm the volunteers on
the ground that such action might
have alienated the sympathies of
many loyal volunteers, and added:
"There are 86,000 Irish Catholics in
the Engllrth army."

Dublln„jBprl8lng.
These notices tauntM tjie Irish
men, saying that the English soldiers
Were shooting their wives and chll
dren. The placards were captured
by twenty-five men of the Munster
Fusiliers who crawled by night to
ward the German trenches.
Half way across the open ground
between the lines a German search
light found them and the German
machine guns caused several casual
ties. The little party remained quiet
for hours and then crawled on and
reached the German wire which they
cut and then charged the trench.
The Germans, who thought the
Irishmen had retreated or been de
stroyed, were so startled that they
evacuated the trench. The placards
were then taken back to the British
trenches in triumph.
