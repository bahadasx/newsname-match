LONDON, May 18. The British
Government knew soveral days In ad
vance that the Irish robcls planned
open revolt, but did not disarm them,
fearing great bloodshed.
Sir Matthew Nathan, who resigned
as Under Secretary for Ireland fol
lowing the rebellion, made this state
ment to-day before the Royal Com
tnifslon appointed to Investigate the
outbreak. Three days before th re
volt In Dublin began the Government
learned that Irish leaders hnd been
luformed the Germans would co-operate
with them In a great land, sea
and air offensive.
Sir Mutthew said the Irish constab
ulary and the military were at onco
warned. The coast was patrolled day
and night to guard against a possible
landing of German arms, and It wus
undoubtedly duu to these precaution-)
that Sir Roger Cascmnt was captured
a few hours after ho lunded.
At the beginning of the disturb

S.OUO of these wero in Dublin. When
tlte revolt tlrst broke out the rebels
hnd only l.SJG rides and pistols, only
825 being in the possession of the
rebels. Tho Sinn Fein leaders had
counted on obtaining their arms and
munition supplies from tho German
auxiliary Aud, which carried 20,000
rifles and 1,000,000 rounds of ammu
nition when she was sunk.
"Irish rebel sympathizers In Amer

Tho plans, he said, called fur the Im

tho leaders. It wns believed at that
tlmo that tho Royal Irish Constabu

cope with the situation. Ho admitted
that tho authorities wero mistaken In
this calculation.
"The rebels exhibited greater or

Senator Thompson said ho believed
he had accomplished all the commit
tee could hupu to iict-oinpllshj in the

chel did not sharo this belief, bul
wanted to uso tho committed us a
medium through which ho might glvn
nut to the public his side of the

Commissioner Woods, while wailing
td bo culled, said that his testimony
would be injurious to tho Uovcrn-
merit. "I regret It," hu said, "but the
Uovernmeut Is bound to be injured by
tho expose I make. I have got to tell
why the New York Police Depart
ment has tapped telephone wires.
The I'ederal authorities nrn working
with our locul police constantly. That
Is the reason.
"I want the chaucu to tell the
Thompson Commit tun all about po

done, tho results obtained and tho
precautions observed to prevent mis

general aspect of tho case, i shall
come to tho case of Seymour nnd
Seymour and frankly tell the rea
sons why the telephone of tbut firm
wus 'listened In' upon.
"Tho method of using the tele
phone to detect nnd prevent crime
has been seriously Injured by tho
present publicity."
It Is reported that Commissioner
Woods will say that tho police have
been busy fur months preventing the
earning out of plans for smuggling
arms into Mexico.
"Since our troops havo gone Irttc
Mexico," Mr. Woods said to-day, "It
has been up to mn to help the Federal
authorities to keep arms out of that
country."
i 'rmmlssloner Woods volunteered
his testimony and the committee wuk
un.Nlous to hear all about the history
of tbo telephone wlro tapping during
