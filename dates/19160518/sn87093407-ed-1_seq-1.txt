A Bitter Pill
Thla ha* rained the leading op-,

anxiety. Most of the delegates art
unlnstructed and they are conse
quently very susceptible to
stampede influences. The leaders
also know that no man In America
today can arou»e such a demon
atratlon as Roosevelt.
It was whispered today that a
boom for Roosevelt would be
launched In the republican conven

"I haven't any political am

That was the statement made

"A lot of people, I under

effects of our fight against II
licit liquor sales by charging
that I'm doing It to make po
litical capital. At first It was,
'He wants to be governor.' Now
It's, 'He wants to be U. B. sen

talk."
The Star sincerely hopes that the Central Labor
council does not reflect the sentiment of all union

not represent that sentiment thru the nation

recognized the need of preparedness.

COUNCIL OF HAVING NOTHING TO DO
W ITH THF. PREPARF.DNKSS PROGRAM.
On the contrary, Seattle labor unionists, who
believe in preparedness, should enthusiastically wel
come the opportunity to parade.
Why?
Because one is indeed blind who refuses to >re
that preparedness is not only a national need, but is
bound to be carried out as a national policy.
And it is up to labor union* to participate active
ly in order that the preparedness achieved shall be a
democratic preparedness, a preparedness that is con
trolled by the masses of the people, a preparedness
that is free from the influence of munitions manufac
turers. a preparedness that is truly representative of
the citizenry of the United States.
"Let us build a wall around ourselves," says the
Seattle Labor council, "and have nothing to do with
preparedness."
