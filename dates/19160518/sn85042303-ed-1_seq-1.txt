GERMANY URGES ALL GERMAN
CITIZENS TO OBSERVE THE
AMERICAN LAWS.

Germany Has Expressed Regret to the
Swiss Government Over Killing of
Two Swiss Citizens in the Torpedo
ing of the Sussex.
Washington. D. C. May IS. Ger
many, through Count Bernstorff, the
ani;basEador to the United States, in
structs all German consuls in the
United States to admonish Gorman
citizens to scrupulously observe the
American laws.
This is done in an effort to end the
various alleged violations of American
neutrality.
Offer Indemnity to Swiss
Berne, Switzerland, May 18. The
German government has expressed re
gret that two Swiss citizens were kill
ed in the torpedoing of the Sussex,
and has promised to indemnify the
families of the victims, the federal de
partment says.
Pope Asks Abandonment.
iLondon, May 18. Representations
have been made to Germany by the
Vatican with a view to inducing Ger
many to abandon submarine warfare,
Foreign Secretary Grey announced in
the house of commons today. He said
he was so informed - by the British
minister at the Vatican.
LEGISLATURE
LOOKS AS IF DEMOCRATS WILL
HAVE TO DEMAND A SACRIFICE
UPON PART OF SOME ONE TO
FILL OFFICE.
"Who Is going to be the second
candidate for the state legislature
from this county"? That is a question
that many are asking and which no
one seems able to answer. A few
days ago several citizens from the
Berwyn community approached F. K.
West, secretary of the Chamber of
Commerce, and stated to him that
they were going to petition him to
make the race as the second man,
but he told them positively that there
was "nothing doing," that he had
other matters to look after, and that
under no circumstances wouid he
consent to accept the place if he
could get it without making the cam
paign. One or two others have been
prominently mentioned, but so far
they have failed to declare them
selves, and unless a democrat does
announce, the socialists or republi
cans may have the privilege of nam
ing one of the, representatives from
this county.
The campaign for county offices is
beginning to warm up, and .while the
formal opening will not take place
until the night of June 3 at Newport
many of the candidates are making
medicine among the boys from the
forks of the creek, and by the time
the race is fairly started they will
be pretty well known all over the
county on account of their present
activities.

TABERNACLE
LAST NIGHT HE ADDRESSED
THOSE WHO HAD BRAVED THE
fQ TLEM ENTS TEXT WAS FROM
'IL. 2:12-13.
Over j. hundred faced the storm
and att('t.' the tabernacle meeting
last night. Te was no disposition
to quarrel Wi . he weather but ev
eryone was th. .ikful to God for the
much needed rain, and grateful ack
nowledgement of it was made in the
opening prayer. Dr. Williams spoke
from I'hil. 2:12-13. His thought was
co-operation with God in the use of
spiritual capital working out what
God works within us. God has stored
the earth with all sorts of metals.
He has worked them in the earth.
-Man mines them, works them out
of the earth, and fashions them for
various needs of civilization. God
works salvation within our souls, and
we are to work it out in deeds of help
ful service for humanity. As a father
starts his son in business with cap
ital and sound business principles
and maxims, so God gives us salva
tion within our souls, spiritual cap
ital, and instructs us to do our level
best with it, make the most out of
it. This does not mean that we are
to work for salvation as if to earn
or merit It by our. good deeds. We
cannot work ourselves into salvation.
For the Bible says that we are saved
by grace, ,the unmerited favor of
God, not by works, lest any man
should boast. But being introduced
into God's grace and salvation be
cause of his great love for us, then
we are with this capital as his gift
to work with all our might to do all
the good we can, with fear and trem
bling lest we fall short of our oppor
tunity, lest we be unfaithful. We
are created in Christ Jesus unto good
works. God ordains that we shall
walk in them. We are to be con
formed into the image of His Son.
We are to bear the fruits of the spir
it. Herein is God glorified that his
children bear much fruit in love, pa
tience, self-denial, and self-ontrol.
Salvation is instantaneous, progress
ive, character-producing and finally
fully consummated. A careful study
of the Scriptures will show this.
We ought to fear and tremble,
watch and pray, never to be off our
guard, lest by our carelessness we
fail to achieve the very best possible
in our salvation. Many times we
waste what God has given us. We
are dispossessed of the powers and
opportunities he has given us, be
cause -unused they are taken away
from us. Nature enforces a terrible
penalty for idleness. Fish in the
Mammoth cave have lost the organs
of sight because of disuse. Nature
illustrates scripture truth in the
things of the soul. We must co
operate with God ns individuals, as
churches and as a community. Our
souls must be fed daily with the
word of life In the study of the scrip
tures. The going of a Christian Is
like the going of a bicycle, when it
ceases to go It falls. We must be
about our Father's business, to de
velop and become strong in charac
ter. We must continue constant in
prayer to achieve the Ideal of the
text. We must work for God. Christ
went about doing good, he did not
wait for the opportunity to come to
him. Christ was an aggressive man,
and how lie shames us in our lazy
indifference as we wait for someone
to come along, like Mr. Micawber,
waiting for something to turn up.
Not only must we abstain from all
evil, but from the very appearance
of evil. This Is the negative side of
the Christian life. The positive side
is, that we must be active and do
good unto all. Sacrifice is almost a
lost grace in the church today. Christ
gave all for us, for our sakes became
poor that we, through his poverty,
might become rich. There are some
who are ready to do any and all
things in a religious sort of way, if
only you do not touch their precious
pocketbooks. We aru to be a living
sacrifice, consenatol to our God. The
best way to grow In grace and in

in Cesena.
Father Alfanl, director of the Flor

Talking of Crops.
C. H. Davenport was here today
from Glenn and reports that crops
are doing very well. Corn is about
three weeks late but the plant is
healthy and growing fast. Cotton is
doing very well, considering the cool
mornings which make somewhat
against its growth. Oats and alfalfa
are doing nicely. The slow rain of
a half inch, which fell last night,
was needed and that much moisture
is all that was needed. The ground
was crusted from former rains and
the moisture that has fallen will
soften the crust and meet the mois
ture in the earth, and growing condi
tions now are almost perfect.
Some mn wouldn't taae good advice

The Italians are falling back south of
Tyrol before the Austrian onset.
About Verdun the French have oust
ed the Germans in some parts of Hill
number 304, capturing a fortified po
sition. The Germans lost heavily in their
attempt to capture a redoubt at Avon

Paris, May 18. The Austrian at
tack against the Italian front in South
ern Tyrol is gradually extending to
the entire Austroltalian front, mili
tary men believe it Is the great Aus
trlan offensive which has been antici
pated.
The falling back of the Italian ad
vance lines is regarded as a strategic
move. The Italian central position in
Louvarone plateau is believed to be
the Austrians' objective.
It is expected that they will attempt
to smash their way through to Vin
ceza Plain. Frencli militarists predict
Austrian failure.
While Vienna claims some progress
at Segnatorto, south of Roverton,
Rome says five attacks launched there
by the Austrians were repulsed with
heavy Austrian casualties and that
bodies of the Austrian dead floated
down the Adige river.

AGREEMENT REACHED YESTER
DAY AFTERNOON AND APPROX
IMATELY $1O0,C0O WILL BE EX
PENDED HERE.
At the meeting of committees from
the chamber of commerce, the business
men's association, and the city com
missioners, yesterday, the proposal of
the Pioneer Telephone company to
erect a modern building unii install
the latest improved facilities for Ard
more, if the sulwcribers were willing
for the ten per cent to be discontinued
was considered a good tiling for Ard
more and for tliu subscribers und all
present attached their names to tho
petition. The telephone company agree
to do all they promised ami spend not
less than 1 100,000.00 before they dis
continue the ten per cent and helievo
all improvements can be installed
within a year. All poles will be moved
from Main street and placed In tho
alleys where such is possible and some
underground work will be done.
Mr. Berry, representing the tele
phone company, stated that the com
pany desired an amicable agreement
with the subscribers. He said that at
an expenditure of about 20,000, im
provements could bo made to take
care of the present needs and would
be done, but lie said the company was
willing to put Ardmore on the same
basis as Tulsa and provide adequate
quarters and facilities to meet de
mands for all time to come if this
proposition met with favor. Ho said
that every subscriber would be
asked to sign the agreement and point
ed out that Ardmore was the only
city in the state which was being al
lowed the discount. Out of the dis
cussion which arose, the consensus of
opinion was that for a concession
amounting to twenty cents per month
on residence phones and thirty cents
on business phones. Ardmore could
well afford to maintain its attitude of
inviting outside capital. The company
merely asked the individual concession
of those present, and did not ask that
they go on record as officials.
Some question has arisen as to Just
when the company will raise the rates
on telephones in this city, and W. H.
Berry Jr., when asked about the matter
this morning stated that Tulsa with 7,-
000 telephones was enjoying the same
rate that the subscribers had for years
and they did not contemplate raising
the rates at present. In regard to the
local situation, he said that the com
pany might raise the rates in this city
after there were as many as five thou
sand telephones in use, as there are
only approximately 1,700 at present it
will be readily seen that the proposed
rale Is not likely to come very soon.
Mr. Hearst is pretty resource
ful, and when there is a lull in- the
Mexican and U-boat situations, he al
ways discovers a horde of Japanese
spies on the Pacific coast.
tt
NO MORE FREE PAPERS a
A great many people do not tt
consider that they are asking tt
anything unreasonable when tt
they call at the Ardmoreite of- tt
flee and request the gift of a tt
paper. It would not be if we tt
were only required to give the tt
one paper, but that is not the tt
case. There is not a day that tt
passes but we are asked for tt
extra papers for one reason or tt
another and every day from tt
five to twenty five papers are tt
passed out for which there Is tt
no return. The price of paper tt
on which the Ardmoreite is tt
printed costs now double what tt
it has cost heretofore, and we tt
are compelled to cut off every tt
item of waste that exists. Here- tt
after every paper that goes out tt
of the Ardmoreite office will be tt
charged for. Do not feel hurt tt
if you are asked for the price of tt
the paper, should you neglect to tt
tender the price. tt

E
BY THE MIDDLE OF JUNE ARD
MORE WILL BE USING GAS
FROM FOX DISTRICT NORTH OF
HEALDTON.
The Ardmore City Gas Company will
begin work next Monday morning to
build a lino from Oil City to the Gyp
sy gas well in the Fox district. The
gas pressure in section 15 in the
Healdton field has gone to pieces and
the company is planning to spend fifty
thousand dollars more in order to sup
ply the people of this city with gas.
The company ordered six-Inch pipe
for the line, but cannot hope to get
the order filled berore the month of
August. It has some pipe of this size
on hand and what it has will be laid,
and the rest of the line will be filled
outwitlj.a smaller size pipe and when
the new pipe arrives it will be laid
and the smaller pipe will be taken
up.
The small pipe that will be laid
will be sufficient in size to supply
the city during the summer and be
fore the cold months come again the
larger line will have been laid and
if the Fox pool supplies gas in suf
ficient quantities the city will have
a plentiful supply for all purposes
next winter. The company made its
first extension to Healdton and now
It Is necessary to make another ex
tension. The Fox district gives pro
mise of iiaving a permanent gas sup
ply. The sand found there 13 very
prolific and the depth gives it a rock:
pressure that is much greater than
the Healdton field ever did have, and
the chances are very good that tho
city wfll have plenty of gas after the
completion of the line to the Gypsy
holdings.
The people of Ardmore are to be
congratulated upon the fact that it
has an aggressive gas company, one
that is not afraid to spend its money
in extending its lines. The line to
Fox should be completed by the
middle of June. A camp will be
established next week, and workmen
will be in the field Monday morning.
Nearly everybody reads The Ard
moreite. Do you?
