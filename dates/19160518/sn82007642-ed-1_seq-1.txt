DtrshtM Ars for Roral Credits.
H. S. 0. Bryant in Newi & Observer.
Representative Dough ton made
a capital Democratic speech on
the rural credit bill in the House
today. He blamed the Republi
cans for lack of legislation for
the people of agricultural enter
prises. "Today will witness in this
House the fulfillment of another
very important pledge made to
the American farmer in the last
National Democratic platform,"
he said, "in that platform, legis
lation, giving to the ogricultur
al classes of America a system of
rural credits, was pledged,
"The Democratic party is the
first party ever to make manifest
in substantial form and to recog
nize the need of this legislation,
which the farmer has so often re
quested and for which he has
waited so long and patiently."
Mr. Doughton then told how
the Republicans opposed the
Federal Reserve Act.
"It was filibustered against for
months and when a vote was fin;
ally taken only thirty-five Re
publicans could be found in this
body and only three at the other
end of the Capitol, who would
give it their support," said he,
"yet, It is now admitted by all
sane, fair-minded men every
where, in Europe as well as in
America, that the Federal Re
serve Aft is the greatest master
piece of financial legislation ever
enacted by any legislative body.
It has been characterized as a
miracle in legislation. Under its
wholesome operation, money pa
nics are impossible and the con
trol of credit is removed from
Wall Street, where it had been
left by the Republican party for
fifty years, and is now placed in
the hands of the government and
the people.
"When the legislation which
we are today considering is plac
ed upon the statute books, and
the farmers are. given the same
opportunity for obtaining credit
that the commercial interests of
the country have, agriculture will
celebrate its "emancipation and
henceforth be free from the thral
dom that has kept it enslaved
so long. Since the time when the
memory of man runneth not to
the contrary, the Republican
party has told the farmer that if
the Democratic., party should
come into power and apply its
policies, the farmer frould be ruin
ed. Yes, the farmer was told that
if the high protective tariff was
lowered the price of his crop
produce, live stock, etc. would
, drop to nothing; that his land
values would depreciate; that he
would be reduced to the state of
the common beggar and walk the
earth in poverty's embrace and
many honest farmers believed
this fabrication. They believed
that in some way the tariff and
the value of farm products were
inseparably' linked together and
that lower customs duties meant
a corresponding lowering of farm
products and stagnation and
death to the farming industry.
But that deception can no longer
control The farmer has been
shown by actual results that he
has too long been the victim of
misrepresentation. He is today
receiving larger prices for bis
products than ever before in the
history of the country and en
joying the greatest season of
prosperity. But what is now
coming his way is only a very
small portion of the additional
advantages and. blessings that
' are to be his when bur entire leg
tislative program for his benefit
has been completed.
,A Added to this legislation and
to its benefits, is a bill providing
jor Federal aid to good roads,
and Also' the Smith-Lever bill,
WILSON.
We remember an observation
by some paper a short time ago
that "everything seems to be
playing to Wilson's hands." Per
haps the editor did not stop to
think that Wilson has been sha
ping Jthjngs so that they must
play into bis hands. That mat
ters have been turning out in
this way is a direct result of the
wise politics that have been for
mulated and adhered to by the
President. The sinking of theLu
sitania was the first test of Wil
son's calm foresight and excel
lent judgment and subsequent
developments proved the wisdom
of his course and established a
confidence in him on part of the.
American people that has never
been shaken. One diplomatic tri
umph after another has followed,
culminating with the kfinal mas
tery of the German situation.
With the surrender of the Kaiser
to the contention of the Wash
ington Government in the mat
ter of adherence to the interna
tional rules of warfare at sea, the
last of the structure which poli
tical opposition had been . build
ing against Wilson tumbled like
a cardboard house. The opposi
tion to the President has been al
most entirely disarmed and the
american people stand as a whole
in admiration of the great head
that has been devising for the
Nation's honor and safety and
the skillful hand that has been
guiding the Nation's destinies. If
anything had been lacking to
make this admiration unani
mous, that thing developed in
the calling out of the State
troops for service on the Mexi
can border. It makes a crowning
and popvlar stroke in his Mexi
can policy that will silence criticH,
that will vindicate the confidence
the people have reposed in him,
and that will give him a higher
place than ever in theestimation
of the country. The National Re
publican party is seeking to re
gain its foothold in the United
States. The hope that it may be
able to do so in the coming elec
tion is a forlorn one. It might
build wisely for the future by the
simple and patriotia act of nom
inating Wilson as its caudidate
for President and join with the
Democrats in making his return
to the White House a matter of
unanimity. Charlotte Observer.

Doughton, "in addition to this,

carries to rural life the benefits
of transportation as well as ex.

livery system throughout the
country. And the farmingclass

Organiztl For Forest Protection.
Timberland owners in Avery,
Watauga and Caldwell counties
will be very much interested in
the formation of the Lin ville For
est Protective Association, which
occurred in Linville a short time
ago. This organization is formed
by the principal timberland own
ers lying along the Blue Ridge
and its outlying spurs between
Blowing Rock, Grandfather
Mountain and Cranberry. The
object of the Association is the
protection of the forest lands
from fire of the members ot the
association.
Among the larger owners rep
resented are the Cranberry Iron
and Coal Company, Sanford and
Tread way, the Linville River
Railroad, Banner and Aldridge,
the Linville Improvement Com
pany. Boone Fork Lumber Co.,
and Mrs. Moses II. Cone. Among
the smaller owners who are join
ing the association are Mr. N. P.
Webb, J. L Hartley, P. M. Brown
E. C. Guy and a number of oth
ers.
The organization of this asso
ciation means a great deal for
this part of the mountain coun
try. Not only will they patrol for
the prevention of tires, but they
will post notices and prosecute
offenders against the forest laws.

According to Miss Susanna
Cocroft, a well known Chicago
health expert, six hundred thou
sand women in thiscountiy have
evinced a keen and active inter
est in a campaign for better
health.
when that many women are
interested in anything something
will move. We are an advocate
of better health. That's the
main plank in our platform. We
think of running for a good fat
job on that issue, the only diffi
culty is that we can't decide
which office we want.
Miss Cocroft. speaking for the
new movement, says the govern
ment pays more attention to its
pigs than it does to its children.
A man with a sick hog can get
expert advice from the govern
ment. A man with a sick child
is absolutely without any help
from the nation. The movement
is not directed against physicians
but to aid them by giving expert
assistance. It is announced that
assurances have been received
from the medical profession that
the plan will not be opposed by
physicians.
In Outlining the proposed cam
paign, soon to show signs of ac
tivity in every community, Uim
Cocroft said: "We need govern
ment laboratories to make ade
quate medical tests by men who
should devote their lives to the
study of this problem. We need
headquarters to which every phy
sician, every individual who has
to do with the health of others,
can go for definite uuthoritative
information.
"If we have raised the value of
our pig crop by learning how to
feed them, we ought to be able
to raise the value of the Con
gress of the United States by
proper feeding experiments
on future candidates. We talk
largely about the conservation
of life, but life is better not con
served unless it is full of health
as well as other things. Peogle
dread the grave yard and then
do their level best to get into it.
"Educate our women by means
of authoritative health bulletin
issued by a central health depart
ment and having back of them
the government guarantee of ac
curacy and practicability."
