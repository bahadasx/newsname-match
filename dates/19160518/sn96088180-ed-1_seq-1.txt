OF
London, May 18. Lieutenant
Colonel Nathan, undersecretary for
Ireland, a witness today before the
royal Investigation committee prob
ing the Irish riots, testified that the
British government know days before
tho revolt that Irish leaders planned
an open revolution. Tho conspira
tors were not disarmed, he said, for
fear such action would cause greater
bloodshed. Irish leaders wore In
formed, accorddlng to Nathan, that
the Germans would co-operate with
tho revolt by launching a combined
sea, air and land olTenslvo agntnst
tho Hrltlsh.
Tho constabulary was warned and
patrolled the Irish coast night and
day to prevent landing of German
arms.
Failure ot the rebel plans and the
capturo of Sir Roger Casement result
ed from these precautions, Nathan
said. He estlnmted the number of
Irish rebels at 15,200, Including
3,000 In Dublin. They had 1.880
rifles, and were counting on having
20,000 more rifles and 1,000,000
rounds of ammunition landed by the
German auxiliary, which wai sunk.
Irish sympathizer In tho United
Slates contributed largely to buy the
rebel arms and spread their litera
ture, Nathan charged. '
