"Developments of a sensational na
ture are expected to follow the seizure
of 65,000 heroin tablets in the olllce
of Dr. J. W. Merrow in this city by
Federal agents.
"The tablets were in two packages,
15,000 in a bottle under a table in a
hall of Dr. Merrow's apartment, and
50,000 in a can under a table in the
kitchen. The seizure is declared to be

icine in Vermont, but Is not registered

Dr. Merrow was for a number of
years located in Burlington where he
maintained an ofllce and practiced as
a specialist. About three years ago
he moved from Burlington to North
Bennington and either leased or bar
gained for. the hotel just opposite the
Rutland railroad station. It was his
expressed Intention at that time to use
the building as a sanitarium and re
sort for nervous invalids. It was
while he was located at North Ben
nington that his wife pressed. suit for
divorce in which Bhe charged that the
physician had been unfaithful. Since
he left North Bennington no informa
tion regarding his movements or loca
tion had been received here until the
news of the raid on his Utica apart
ments became known.

the geographical teatures sucn as

EtTBE
OF 211.0Q0 MEN
Army Reorganization Bill Goes
Through Senate
HOUSE TO APPROVE AT ONCE
First of Big National Defence Meas
ures Should Reach President in
Few Days.
Washington, May 17. The senate
after an all day debate agreed tonight
to the conference report on the army
reorganization bill without a roll call.
The house is expected to approve the
report within a day or two, and send
tho first ot the big national defense
measures to the President.
The bill provides for a regular army
of 211,000 olliceis and nieu at peace
strength, and approximately 250.0 0 0 at
war strength and for a federalized na
tional guard of 457,000 officers and
men at maximum strength.
Discussion of the conference report
embraced a denunciation of Great
Hritian for execution of the Irish revo
lutionists, attacks on the administra
tion's Mexican policy, renewed as
saults on the national guard as a politl
cal force, and various criticisms of the
provision for a government nitrate
manufacturing plant.
Senator Fall asserted that , General
Pershing with the 14,000 troops at his
command could march to Mexico City,
taking every town with little trouble,
if he were unhampered by orders from
Washington, and that ninety per cent
ot the Mexican people would welcome
such action.
He also declared that representa
tives of General Carranza were negoti
ating with foreign governments
against the United States, and that
tills government would be forced to
fight foreign forces on Mexico soil if
It did not soon do its full duty to the
people of Mexico and the. United States.
Senator Borah or Jdano. renewing
his attack on the National Guard as a
political force, declared it would prove
to be more detrimental to the United
States than an invading army. He
arraigned Great Hritain for the Irish
executions, declaring there had been
no greater blow to free institutions
since the European war began.
Senator Lodge ami Senator Stone of
the foreign relations committee also
criticized the army bill, the former
blaming the house for not accepting a
larger regular army proposed by the
senate, and the latter maintaining the
proposed army was too great. Senn
tor Stone said he was so anxious to see
the nitrate provision enacted that he
would almost be willing to agree to
any size army necessary, but insisted
there was no need of an announced
army.
PENROSE STILL ON TOP.
Philadelphia Gives Ford More Votes
Than Hughes and Roosevelt.
Harrlsburg, Pa.. May IS. United
States Senator Boise Penrose was vie
torious in the Pennsylvania primary
election contest in the most delermin
ed effort that has ever been made to
overthrow his leadership of the repub
llcan party. Despite the energetic
fight waged against him by the faction
of the party which chose Gov. .Brum
baugh for Its leader, Senator Penrose
nominated his candidate for auditor
general of the state, Charles A. Snyder
by from 25,000 to 40.000 majority. A
majority or the 71! delegates elected to
the national convention are Penrose
men and a new state committee was
chosen that will elect him a member of
the republican national committee to
succeed Henry G. Wasson of Pittsburg.
Incomplete returns at Philadelphia
last night Indicate that Gov Brum
baugh, running ahead of his ticket,
was elected delegate-nt-large to the
national convention. It is not yet
certain that any of his 11 colleagues
on tho antl-Penroso ticket for dele
gat esat-large were successful. In the
campaign the Penrose element favored
an unlnstructed delegation, while the
Brumbaugh faction advocated the
election of delegates pledged to vote
for the popular choice of the voters
as the party's presidential candidate
On the republican preferential bal
lot, only one name was printed, t lint
of Brumbaugh and . there was much
Interest in the extent to which voters
would write on the ballot the name
of the party leader they favored. In
Philadelphia, in n total vote of 178,
353, Brumbaugh got 08,770 votes
Ford 3123. Roosevelt 203li and Hughes
507. Some other counties report scat
terlng voles for these candidates, but
the only one outside of Philadelphia
showing a vote for Ford of any conse'

ARMY AUSTRIANS BEGIHMIUI!
OF FEiSl IE
li! TYROL
Army of 300,003 Thrown Against
Italian Lines
THREE OAYS OF FIGHTING
Teutons Have Sustained Heavy Losses
But Have Gained Some
Positions.
Amsterdam, May 18. An army of
300,000 Austrlans Is engaged in a com
bined attack against the Italians in the
Tyrolean Alps. It is believed that
Austria contemplates an Invasion of
northern Italy.
In three days fighting the Austrlans
are reported to have suffered heavy
losses.
Vienna, May 18. The new offensive
movement of the Austrians on the Ital
ian front is continuing successfully
and a number of oilier positions have
been captured. More than 0000 men.
13 cannon and 17 machine guns have
been taken. The statement follows:
Austro-ilungarian troops advanced
on Armentara ridge. On Folgarmo
plateau they captured positions on the
enemy at Sogliodaspieo Cosina, Cos-
tadgra and Maronia. Austrian-Hun
garian troops also entered the Ter
rignola section at Piazza and drove the
Italians from Moscbere. During the
night they stormed Zegnatorta, south
of Hoverefo. "Tho number of prison
ers taken In this fighting reached 141
officers and 6200 men. We also cap
tured 17 machine guns and 13 cannon."
Interest In the wnr operations, says
a dispatch from London, has suddenly
shifted to- the Italian front, where the
Austrlans have begun to attack along
the whole line, but particularly in the
80Utliern Tyrol against the Italian
troops threatening Trent. Here the
Italian troops occupied positions just
over the Austrian "border, from the
Adige valley;' douth of Rovereto, to the
Astlco valley. The Austrian attacks
cover a Trout of 23 miles. .
The ItAlirtns admit their retirement
on this front, and the latest official
Austrian account claims continued
gains, the "capture ot several enemy
positions and the penetration of the
Terragonftl section, tho driving of tho
Italians from Moschere and the
storming of Zegnatorta.
TWO AMERICANS RESCUED
Captured During Raid by Mexican
Bandits Two Weeks Ago.
Marathon. Tex., May 17 Jesse
Deemer, storekeeper on the Interna
tional boundary near Roquillas, Tex.,
captured two weeks ago oy Mexican
raiders, has been set free, six of his
captors killed and seventy-live of
them made prisoners.
This, news was brought here today
by messengers and over the govern
ment signal corps wire from the south.
Tho reports say Major Langhorne's
two troops of the Light cavalry, who
took the trail of the bandits from
here, overtook the Mexicans 120 miles
south of the border at Kl Pino, a small
village.
One report is the Americans fought
the bandits in the village. Another that
the bandits fled on the approach of the
Americans, leaving Deemer behind, at
so his negro cook, Monroe Payne, and
his Mexican clerk, Jose Soils, and that
t lie Americans followed and surround
ed the bandits outside the town.
Officially the enpture of seventy-five
prisoners is not admitted. This comes
from private sources.
The rescue of Deemer and his two
men was one or the main reasons for
sending the expedition into Mexico,
and tills accomplished, it is possible
the troops will return to the Big liend
region and settle down as border
guards, ns the distance from here to
the Mexican line Is almost 100 miles
the roads are poor and the line of com
miinleution hard to keep open.
The captured bandits are to be
brought back to the American side of
the line, it is declared.

Austria Makes Protest to Neutral
Powers
SIXTEEN PASSENGERS LOST
Vienna Claims Second Torpedo Hit
Life Boat Full of
Passengers.
Berlin, May 17. According to the
Austro-ilungarian note sent to neutral
powers regarding the sinking of the
Austrian steamer Dubrovnik and oth
er Austrian vessels, including the
hospital ship Electra, by hostile sub
marines, the Dubrovnik had 19 passen
gers Ion board, including several wo
men and children, when she was tor

crew and four passengers are missing.
The Overseas news agency yester
day, in its summary of the Austrian
note, sets forth the details regarding
the sinking of the Dubrovnik as fol
lows: "A dispatch from Vienna states t hat
the Austro-Hungarlan government has
delivered a note to the representatives
of neutral powers stating that on May
!), at 10.30 a. in., the Austro-ilungarian
passenger steamer Dubrovnik was de
stroyed in the Adriatic by two torpe
does fired without warning by an
enemy submarine. The first torpedo
hit the starboard side and the ship im
mediately began sinking.
"All the persons on board rushed

The news agency summing up
after mentioning the allusions In the

Two other American citizens who

DENY WOMEN CHURCH VOTE
Long Island Episcopal Diocesan Con
vention Votes "No," 86 to 84
Garden City, L. I.. May 17,t-T1io
Long Island Diocesan Convention of
the Protestant Episcopal church this
afternoon considered granting the vot
in parish elections to the women of the
diocese, but the motion was lost by
vote of 80 to 84. The opponents argued
that the proposal would tend to destroy
unity of the church, ns It would bt
local prerogative. At the morning sen
sion of the convention, which was held
in the Cathedral of the Incarnation
here, a discussion relative to communi
cants was held, with especial attention
pnld to the requirements to become
such. The Issue was one of high and
low church.
SAME BOARD OF TRADE OFFICERS
Elected at Meeting of the Board
of
Trade Wednesday Evening
The new directors of the Bennington
Board of Trade, chosen at the recent
business meeting and banquet in the
Putnam House, held their first meeting
in the secretary's office Wednesday
evening and re-elected William II.
Nichols as president and Emory S.
Harris as secretary.
There were present: William II.
Nichols, Emory S. Harris, John Nash,
Fred C. Martin, A. C. La.Marre, Dr. F.
S. Pratt, Harry it. North. Collins M.
Graves and William H. Wills.
Several resolutions were brought in
for official attention, the most import
ant of these on which the Board's vot
ed was a resolution of thanks to James
C. Colgate for his contribution to the
new west road. Among the other busi
ness transacted was the vote to see if
the Rutland railroad would not give
the public better phone service at the
local station, especially in the instal
lation of a pay station. At the present
time, regardless of the urgency of the
call, it is necessary to travel sonic dis
tance before an available instrument
can be found.
The board also determined to take
up with Supt. (ireen of the local street
railway the question of extending the
trolley line further cast on Main
street. The board was given to under
stand that at the time the road was
built, material was purchased for the
extension of the road to a point 500 to
1000 feet further than at present. The
board is desirous of ascertaining if
this equipment is still available and If
it cannot be utilized.
A question which was discussed at
some length was the suggestion which
has been current recently that the
Boaid of Trade co-operate with the
County Improvement Association in
the hiring of one paid secretary who
shall look after the work of both or
ganization on salary large eonugh to
secure a ctnipetent man.
The resignation of Willard V, Bart-
lett makes this an opportune time for
action along this line. It is felt, that
by the employment of a business ex
ecutive, the right individual could
bring together all industrial interests
in Bennington and the county into liar
mony and build both societies strong-
r than ever. This does not mean that
cither one cf them would lose its iden
tity; simply that the expense of a
salaried secretary be divided be
tween the two. It is understood that
the County Improvement Association
are net opposed to such a suggestion.
The matter was taken uuder advise
ment. LIQUOR SEIZURE IN RUTLAND

Final Session at Old First Church
This Morning
WOMEN'S WIRE CONDEMNED
Resolutions Also Affirm Belief That
Promotion Will Ultimately Solve
Liquor Evil.
The Vermont Congregational confer
ence, which opened its 121st annual
meeting , here Tuesday alternoon,
closed its sessions this morning with
the usual resolutions and a visit by tha
delegates to the historic places and
shrines at Old Benuington, the closing
service being held at the Old First
church with an address on "Some
Roots of the Fast," by Rev. Isaac
Jennings.
One of the practical topics of the
convention yesterday afternoon was
the address on "The Church and Mo
tion Pictures," presented by Rev. A.
W. Bailey of the Sunday school ami
Publishing Society of Boston.
The speaker took the ground that
the motion picture is one of the strong-
st influences now at work upon tho
life of the community, greater than the
hutch. He claimed that picture
houses were doing more to put the sa
li.on out of business than anything
Billy Sunday is doing and that they
are al.-.o putting cheap vaudeville
shows down and out. He spoke of the
norniou.s salaries paid such as $070,-
000 a year to Charlie Chaplain to make
focd oi himself, and $500,000 a year
as a salary to dainty .Mary ricklord.
in contrast to the salary paid the presl
dent of the United States and other
noted men. Ninety per cent of the
hildren of the country attend the
iiioies, more or less, and while tho
motion picture is but 14 years old its
scope and extent is constantly increas
ing and it will socn demand a place
not only on week days, but Sundays.
The speaker thought the quality was
