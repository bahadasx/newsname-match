This is a gala day for North Dakota Masons, and more especially
those of Devil? Lake and the Lake Region. It is the day of the
^dedication of the beautiful new Masonic temple in "this city. A
-temple which has recently been completed at a cost of $50,000,
i^and probably the finest temple in any city the size of Devils Lake
:|dn the whde*United States. Hundreds of Masons are hereto take
part in the ceremonies and witness a ceremony of its kind in Devils
"Lake probably for the first and last time in their lives.
It is possibly one of the greatest Masonic days in this city that
r*~we will see for some time, and nothing is left undone to make all
^present have an enjoyable time.
In 1885, while we were still a territory, Minnewaukan Ladge No.
,75 was duly organized and the first meeting was held on Thursday

To/those who have been in close touch with the various Masonic
bodies of this city, it will be seen that many of the old-timers have
gone to their final reward, and others have scattei'ed and gone, un
til but few of the oldest members are left in this city and county.
Two of the did and prominent members who still have member
ship^ in the local lodge might be mentioned Hon. Henry C._ Hans
brough, who formerly published the Inter-Ocean in this city and
who for eighteen years w&ft United States Senator from this .state.
He is now located in Virgfi»a,' but is still a member of Manewau
kan IX^ge No. 21. Mi* Hansbrough was tiie fii'st member to be
raised in this lodge. Another one, who the old-timers *rjjl re
member with much pleasure is the Hon. John A. Percival, .who was
the first master of this lodg4 and who has the distinction of being
the only life member of Minnewaukan Lodge No. 21. Mr. Percival
is now locfttefl In New York City and is the president of one of the
richest mining companies in the world, and is a millionaire.
The varies Mascniic bodies in this city have .been very active
the oast, and Devils Lake stands out as one oC ,the leamng aties of
its size in the whole northwest in masonry, Something °ver a

as a building committee. They secured the services of J. A. Shan
non, one of our local architects, to draw pflan£ and after they were
completed and accepted a call for bids was made, and when they
were opened the contract was let to Fjelseth & Johnson, local con
tractors. When the building was completed-ahd ready to furnish
M. L. Sprung, local furniture man, was awarded the contract for
the furnishings, and thus practically from the start to completion
the work has been done by 'local men. The building committee has
been a tireless bunch of workers, and mush credit is due them for
their efforts. Those who have inspected this temple have pro
nounced the architectural work a masterpiece, and it has been de
monstrated that Devils Lake have architects who have no superior
in the northwest. To Mr. Shannon is due the thanks of the entire
ledge for his faithful services and his care in seeing that every
thing worked out to a nicety. While the work was not started un
til late in the season, the contractors who had the contract went to
work with a will, and they spared no energy in pushing the struc
ture to completion, and one cannot inspect it without saying that
Messrs Fjelseth & Johnson are able to compete with any firm in
the splendid and rapid work they do.
The furnishings alone in this tempie cost in the neighborhood of
1,000, and the interior, if possible, presents a more beautiful ap
pearance than the exterior.
The splendid banquet and ball rooms, the arrangement of the
various rooms which are used by the various branches of the order
are all beautifully arranged, and in speaking of the Blue room, it
is said that there is not a Blue room in any temple in the whole
northwest that is the equal of this one.
Promptly the dedication exercises began and were earned out
without a hitch. It was a beautiful ceremony and was witnessed
by the largest crowd of Masons and their families ever seen in this
city.
At 5:30 over five hundred sat down to a most elaborate banquet
which had been prepared for the occasion. There was an orches
tra playing sweet strains of music during the entire meal.
At 9:00 P. M., dancing began in the beautiful ball room and until
early morning a most delightful time was had At midnight there
was another fine lunch. Every pprt of the' program passed on
smoothly, and much credit is due to the vajfibus committees in
charge for their efforts.
This is a day long to be remembered by the people of Devils Lake
and more especially the Masons who have witnessed fee erection
of the most beautiful tuples in the state..
and dedication of one
