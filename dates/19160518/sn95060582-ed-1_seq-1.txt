The Galahad of
Arizona:
Governor Hunt
By Peter Clark MacFarlane
(From Collier's Weekly)
HONOR REPLACES PRISON BARS.
The governor found several
hundred prisoners fretting m
aem-idleness in the great concrete
structure at Florence, and in his
hatred of waste he began to put
them to work at road construction.
Already, under his predecessors,
apian had been formed to use
the prisoners in the construction
of a concrete bridge at Tempe.
This was carried out by Gover
nor Hunt, and the result is a
beautiful structure. Another
such bridge was erected in an
other part of the State, besides
which some scores of miles of road
building have been done by con
victs. But the spectacular part of the
governor's prison policy had to
do with his application of the
"honor system" in dealing with
individuals prisoners. This be
gan when the executive tele
phoned to the prison and asked
that a certain convict be sent to
him at his office in Phoenix.
The prisioner set. out unattended
upon the journey of some seventy
miles and Guly presented himself
before the executive.
Now, it appeared that the State
owned a team of mules which
Were then at a point where the
cost of 'sWpp1tfK"thenTto" Phoenix"
where they were'wanted would be
cons derable. The governor gave
this convict the money for his
railway fare expenses and told
him to go and get the mules and
-drive them to Phoenix. Along
with the money the governor
gave the prisoner a little talk,
explaining that he was putting
him upon his honor that he was
involving himself in thus trust
ing the prisoner, and that upon
the man's ability to rise to his op
portunity depended his own
future and that of a whole new
prison system. The man nodded
his appreciation pledged his honor
a thing he had not been recog
nized before as possessing and
departed. This departure was
the signal for newspaper jeers.
There was a general agreement
that the man would go all right
oh, yes, he would go and he
would get the mules but there
after? Well, thereafter the
mules would comfortably assist
the man to disappear. That was
the theory of the cynics. But
the gloomy guessers were wrong.
The man brought back the mules
and reported for admission to his
prison cell.
This was the beginning. The
governor developed his honor
system rapidly and did some very
.startling things. -One life pri
soner was granted a furlough to
go back to Kentucky and visit his
father, whose health was de
clining. He made a stay of sixty
days and returned to prison. In
another instance a prisoner of an
inventive turn was permitted to
go to Washington and spend
some time there interceding for a
patent npon one of his devices
Several times men were allowed
to go. for a few hours to the bed
sides of .sick wive3, sometimes
alone and sometimes under guard.
In a number of other cases men
I 'it j i a. r ;i:
Willi uepenueiiL xamuies were
taken out of the prison and sent
home to work out their time sup
porting their own wives and
children, instead of leaving the
burden upon the community.
The men who went out to work
upon the rodas all went upon
honor. The number of guards
was invariably few. In some
instances surveying parties com
posed of prisoners traveled about
the country for weeks at a time
entirley without guards, except
that each prisoner constituted
himself a guard over all the
other.
JEERED BY ENEMIES
OCCASIONALLY the temp
tation of near-liberty and the
wide-open country proved too
much, and an honor man at
tempted escape. At such times
the State was treated to the un
usual spectacle of penitentiary
convicts scouring by day and
night the desert and the mountain
wilds in search of a fellow con
vict.
Within the walls of the State
prison, too, every endeavor was
made to substitute a rule of
humanity and gentleness for one
of stupid rigor. Dnngeons,
solitaries, and "snake holes"
were abolished. A library, a
school, a band, and a prisoners'
association for mutual helpful
ness were encouraged,
The prisoners are better fed
and more comfortably housed
ana cared lor. instead or a
sclieauleof punisnments a system
of rewards is emphasized. An
air of optimism actually obtains
about the place. Outside labor
and the position of an "honor
man" are the goals to be attained
by good conduct. The whole
system is a school of character
building devised to send the man
out oi pnson netter tnan he en
tered it provided there is on his
part an aspiration or a potential
aspiration to be better. Nor are
the rather remarkable liberties
extended at times scattered about
recklessly. Either a very wise
judgment or an unusual streak
of good luck has attended the
governor's selection, since the
number of men who have prov ed
recreant to the trust imposed has
been proportionately small.
ut no mauter now sane or
successful the governor may
have been in the inauguration
of his prison policy, it was inevi
table that i t should be greatly
misunderstood and be made the
basis of bitter attack. His politi
cal and newspaper enemies were
quick to make the most of any
failures or lapses on the part of
the governor's prison proteges.
Any slightest mischance became
the peg on which to hang lugu
brious tales of muderers loosed
upon the community and danger
ous criminals flung broadcast over
the face of the country. There
were gibes and jeers, hints that
the penitentiary was made so
nice a place to board that there
was an actual waiting list among
the criminals population of the
State.
But the criticism did not stop
here. It went on to falsification.
Incidents harmless in themselves
were made to appear grave.
Lying half truths were told.
Facts-, were distorted. False
statements were printed in ;
short, the governor's prison
policy was notbnly reviewed criti
cally but its results were so mis
represented that many of the
sincere and well meaning people
of Arizona reading these horrible
tales and haying no means of
knowing theirj falsity could not
duc De oi opmipn tnat tne gover
nor was the soft-hearted senti
mentalist his critics made him
out to be. 1
Undoubtedly his concerted and
long continued newspaper attack
upon Hunt's prison policies is
clever strategy. The policies are
new in Arizona They have not
been instituted without mistakes.
They are easily misunderstood
and misrepresented. It would
not be good politics for a corpor
ation press to attack a governor
because he had raised their tax
assessments (which ought to
have been done years before),
nor because he had lightened the
burden on the small householder,
nor because he strongl social
sympathies, nor because he
thought that governmental
methods could be improved, nor
because he had attempted to en
force in the State those economies
and efficiencies which he employ
ed in Old Dominion Commercial
Company when he advanced its
stock value from $100 to $1,000 a
share.
On the other- hand, it is good
politics vagnely to charge ex
travagance, to; kindle suspicion
to magnify doubts, to appeal to
prejudice, toexhte fears and to
make a man whose honesty is
unimpeachable seem like a jelly
fish sticky with sentimentality
and helplessly incapable of laying
aside small hobbies in the pre
sence of a great responsibilty.
Of course the place where this
charge of sentimentality seemed
to Hunt's enemies to stick tight.
est was in the governor's attitude
toward capital punishment. The
death penalty was the law, but
an amendment to the Constitu
tion abolishing capital punish
ment was to be voted on at the
November election of 1914 the
same election at which the refer
endum on the pardoning power
of the executive was to be decided
Thus the issue was joined.
Meantime twelve men were in
the State prison awaiting the
hangman. But the governor held
off the noose by reprieves from
time to time until the people
should decide.
However, as voting time drew
near, there were many things to
occupy the popular mind. Pro
hibition was one of them. Hunt
himself was another, for he was
now a candidate for reelection.
Of course accordingtohis enemies
Hunt was as good as dead al
ready; the only function of the
election would be finaliy to inject
the embalming fluid in his veins.
But the people were not so sure.
In their minds the question re
quired much debating so much
so that between it and prohibition
they appeared to forget about
capital punishment and the par
doning power. They reelected
Hunt by a plurality of nearly
8,000 which was very handsome
indead population considered;
but they sustained capital punish
ment by a majority of 1,252, and
. t i i 1 1 j. i
they let the governor s ref eren-1
dum against the loss of his pardon '
ing power go down to defeat I
Here, then, was this timid,
determined, soft-hearted gover
nor, with a death-penalty statute
upon the books and his pardoning
power gone glimmering. Hunt
was sick of soul. He couldn't
see these men die. To test the
law, he took the bull by the horns
and issued a pardon. The lower
court decided that he had no right
to issue the pardon. Hunt went
to the higher court One member
of this tribunal sustained Hunt,
but two members sustained the
law. The hangings must be held.
A date was named for execution
of five men, all Mexicans. No
power could save them now but
the Board of Pardons and Paroles
and the board resisted all pres
sure, rne day oi execution ar
rived. Warden Sims: heavy of
heart, made ready to the last
gruesome detail. The State
prison is Hunt's pet He is
there whenever auy thing of im
portance happens. This day he
was not present. He could not
even think of going. He was in
the executive office seventy miles
away and in tears until cheer
ing news arrived. At the solici
tation and request of many
thousand Mexicans in the State,
the Villa Government had re
quested the Secretary of State to
use his influence to have the five
condemned men i epi ieved
or their sentenced commuted.
The Board of Pardons and Pa
roles reprieved the men for nine
weeks, or until July -SO, 1915.
This day the State Department
renewed the request for the
staying of the execution of .the
Mexicans. The Board of Par
dons and Paroles declined to
grant the request. Writs of
habeas corpus were secured by
attorneys for the prisoners which
had the effect of suspending four
of the hangings. The legality of
these writs is an issue still pend
ing in the Arizona courts.
The attorneys for Ramon Villa
lobo, the fifth of the condemned
Mexicans, appealed in vain to the
Supreme Court for a stay of ex
ecution, and upon December 10,
1915 the young State of Arizona
inflcted the death penally for
the first time.
BILL AGAINST HANGING.
On account of the refusal of
the superintendent of the Pinal
County Prison to execute William
Faltin because of the testimony
ot two physician that the co n
victed man was insane, Faltin
vas transferred to an insane
asylnm, but not Without i
sharp clash between the super
intendent and the attorney gen
eral who charged the superin
tendent with contempt of court
The Supreme Court dismissed
the charge ot contempt and ex
onerated the superintendent. In
another instance a prisoner under
a death sentence was notwith
standing the dictum ot jurors
and physicians, declared insane
by the board of Pardons and
Paroles, and was given a life
sentence.
A measuie proposing the abol
ition of capital punishment will
be submitted to the electors at
the next general election.
The battle for other propressive
measures goes on too. The
thoughtful will reflect that when
a man after thirty yeary in State
politics, each year more success
than the last, still rides in quest
of his ideals it speaks much for
wig UlaiaLbCi mail aim
vfirv rpa ,ieal for the character
the character of the man and a
of the citizenship which gives
him his victories.
