SOOTH MOUNTAIN
MINES TO OPEN UP!
Mr. Bell, state mine Inspector of
Malm, reports the recent consum
iiiiiiluM of a drill through the Influ
ence of Stanley A Knaton of the
Hunker lllll A Sullivan mine, on the
south Mountain nilneii In Owyhee
county, near Jordan Valley, which
will Involve the Immediate and ac
tive development of the properties
of the Smith Mount iiln company.
In fact, an engineer has already
been Kent from Kellogg nnd Is now
visiting Jordan Valley and Silver
'lty picking tip a crow- of minor,
and will start work In driving the
Oolromln tunnel ns MM iik supplies

crew of men collected
Th work will be done by hand'

Intentliin of Mr. him and Ills as
sociate to Install an air compressor
and push tin- .ni. prise with ma

work now being undertaken has pro
gressed sufficiently to warrant a
more complete mechanical equip
ment The South Mountain company's
property embraces a group of 1 pat
ented claims, covering the crest of
South mountain, 20 miles southwest
of Silver City. It embrace the old
Oolconda vein, which Is the original
leading silver mining enterprise In
the present area of Idaho.
This old property was equipped
with a small smelter In 187ft, when
the bullion had to bit hauled by ox
teams to Wlnnemucca, Nev. During
that period the rich carbonate ore
mined In the surface produced rlc.
liver-bearing lead bullion to the
total value of three hundred and fif
ty thousand dollars, but at shallow
depth the ore contained a strong
mixture of copper and line sulphide
which proved refractory and too dif
ficult to handle under the Imperfect
melting methods of that day.
The property has since, at lnte
vals, been subjected to considerable
further development, but has now
been Idle for several years. It la a
large contact vein wltn bold mineral
outcrops extending for several thous
and feet along Ita strike over the
crest of South mountain, and at .lit
fereut openings discloses quite defl.
nite Indications of large bodies of
lead-silver, iluc and copper sulphide
ores, which are Invariably rich In
sliver and In some Instances also In
gold.
J It lllackaby of Ontario and j
Thos. Kohout of Jordan Valley are
among the owners of this property
mid they are confident that at pres
ent prices of metal there will be a
nice margin of profit
There will be a long haul by motor
truck but good rules can be made
with a large tonnage in sight as there
Is always pleutv of back freight from
Ilomedale to Jordan Valley.
