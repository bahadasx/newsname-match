his army may, when recruited, be
large aiQugh to be visible to Gen.
Pershing's naked eye.

RURAL
CREDITS
BILL IS PASSED
Farm Loan Board and
Twelve Land Banks
Provided.
G PER CENT. MORTGAGES
Senate Measure Greatly At
Variance Expect Easy
Adjustment.
Washington, May 15. The Glass
Rural Credits Bill, providing for a
Federal farm loan board and a system
of twelve land banks, passed the
House late to-day by a vote of 295 to
10. A similar measure already has
passed the Senate, and the differences
probably will be worked out soon in
conference.
Little opposition was encountered
by the bill, which was piloted through
the House by Representative Glass,
of Virginia, and Representative
Phelan, of Massachusetts. Under
its terms the land banks would lend
money to farmers at not more than 6
per cent, interest, through local loan
associations, on mortgages running
from five to thirty-six years. The
mortgages would be used by the
banks as the basis for farm loan
bonds.
There are many differences be
tween the Senate House bill to be ad
justed. The Senate measure wofild
capitalize each farm loan bank at
$500,000, the House's at $750,000.
The Senate would authorize loan as
sociations with unlimited liability, the
House would not. The Senate would
limit loans on lands to 50 per cent,
with no recognition of improvements;
the House proposes to grant W) per
cent, on land values and 20 per cent,
on value on permanent insurable im
provements. MAJORITY DECISION.
The Senate proposes that no loan
shall bo made if the three members of
the local loan committee are not
unanimous in their appraisement; the
House would require a majority re
port of the committee. The Senate
makes the minimum loan $200; the
House of $100. The Senate would
charge borrowers 10 per cent, inter
est on all defaulted payments; the
House would charge only contract
rates. The Senate would require lo
cal association to make good all de
faults within thirty days after notice
from a land bank; the House would
provide a special reserve to protect
associations.
The Senate Bill requires advance
navments on the principal in sums of
$100 or multiples and the House $25
or multiples. The Senate makes the
actual earning power of the land a
principal factor and the House makes
the agricultural value the principal
basis of appraisement.

RUSS
ADVANCE
PERILS BAGDAD
Two Armies, Marching South
and West, Strike at Rear
of Turkish Forces.
COMMUNICATIONS BROKE
Seven Divisions of Sultan's
Troops in Mesopotamia
Jeopardized by Attack.
Petrograd, May 17. With the ad
vance of the Russian forces south
ward from the Urumiah region toward
Mosul, in Assyria on the Tigris, which
resulted recently in the occupation of
Rivandouza, the Russians are now
bringing fresh pressure of the most
powerful sort upon the rear of the
Turkish armies in Mesopotamia.
The development of this new line
of attack has greatly enhanced the
chances of success for the Russian
campaign in Mesopotamia which holds
forth the hope now entertained in
Petrograd of bringing not only Bag
dad, the Holy City of Caliphs, but the
entire historic country lying between
the Tigris and the Euphrates under
Russian dominion.
Of the two groups of Russian arm
ies which are now threatening Meso
potamia overland, the one already
mentioned has crossed the Mesopo
tamia border and is marching rapidly
towajd Mosul. The only serious ob
stacle between it and this goal is the
ancient fortified city of Jezireh-Ibon-
Omar, on an island in the Tigris, 130
miles southeast of Diarbekr,
CAN'T DELAY ADVANCE.
It is believed that this city with its
antiquated defense will not be able
long to delay the Russian advance.
The progress of these forces already
has broken the backbone of the Turk
ish communication between Diarbekr
and Mosul and the Turkish armies
covering these two points are now
separated except for a circuitous road
too far in the rear to be of much ser
vice. Some 200 miles southward the oth
er group of Russian forces, drawn up
on the Persian-Turkish border be
fore Khanikin, is prepared to strike
through to Bagdad. The combined
pressure from two directions upon
the Turkish rear has placed the entire
Turkish army in Mesopotamia, esti
mated at between six and seven divi
sions, in the greatest jeopardy.
According to the latest dispatches
the Turks have been forced to relax
to a great extent their resistance to
the British expeditionary army and
rush troops northward. Thus it is
thought the successes which have
been won by the Russians will soon
have an effect on the fortunes of the
British campaign.
BAGDAD RAILWAY CUT.
The Russian official statement, an
nouncing that the advance on Mosul
continues, probably veils important
news. The Russian, communications
are generally a day or two Lite in an
nouncing the actual attainments nt
it is considered not unlikoly tb yv
Bagdad railway, which riij& aj,,I1r
the left bank of Uio Tigris and i is

rendy cut. The Russian advanc m
this direction has been swift nd
silent toward an easy road wl ich
leads to Mosul or ancient Nineveh,
where tho German Bagdad railway
joins tho Tigris, finrmimv !. imr.
J ricJiy dispatched forces, it is believed,
to tlie lurkish center at Erzingan, to
try to stem tho Russian advance. But
apparently these efforts have come
too late.
