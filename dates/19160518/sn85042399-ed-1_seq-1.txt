AND
General Matters
From the Council
The matter of allowing S. A.
Hawkes to tap the city water main
was brought up again. He offered to
pay $25 and the cost. It seems that
he wanted to come into the city but
some of his neighbors who are be-
tu'oon Vllm nn1 ttlA pltv will tint. Pnmfl
in. This was his reason for bringing
it up again. The council did not
think this good enough grounds for
granting his request, however, and it
was disallowed.
The Springs Dedication Celebration
committee asKea permission
for a
fireworks display during the Fourth
of July celebration. It was referred
to the ordinance committee and Mr.
Frohbaeh, who was in attendance,
was asurcd that the request would be
granted, even if an ordinance had to
be amended in so doing.
The above committee next asked
for the exclusive right to sell conces
sions for refreshment and amusement
stands. The matter was referred to
the ordinance committee and the city
attorney. Mr. Frohbaeh stated that
besides being a proposition to raise
money for the celebration it was a
protection to business men.
The committee also requested that
they be allowed to license jitneys to
run to the round-up grounds. The
maximum fare to be charged was 10
cents. The matter was referred and
recommended to the ordinance com
mittee and the city attorney. Chief
Porter said that the drivers must
have chauffeurs' licenses also.
Mrs. Margaret W. Ware tendered
her resignation from the library
board. She Is leaving town. The
resignation was accepted and Mrs.
Palmerlee appointed in her place.
Mrs. O. H. Barnhill was appointed In
the place of Mrs. R. L. Burdlc, who
has taken up her residence elsewhere
permanently.
A lady living on Allison street re
quested that boys should be stopped
from playing ball on that street.
Chief Porter stated that he had al
ready taken action against them as
he thought, permanently.
Policeman John B. Wlmer asked
for a short vacation and his request
was granted.
W. A. Patrick for the West side
and J. E. Arant for the East side were
appointed td check the irrigation of
the city and their salary fixed at
$2.50 for an eight-hour day. They
were to start out Wednesday.
The council decided to meet at the
recorder's office Wednesday morning
at 9 o'clock to confer with a repre
sentative of the Bowers Rubber Com
pany of Portland about the purchase
of 500 feet of fire hose.
The present 4-cent rate per kilo
watt hour for electric ranges was low
ered to 3 cents on the recommenda
tion of the light committee.
The report was brought by the city
attorney that children under 14 years
of age cannot be placed In detention
in the same building with adults. An
entirely separate building must be
used. It was recommended that such
a place of detention be fitted out.
The Kinney barn on Mill street was
brought up again. It was decided
that it would cost more than the bam
was worth to move it, so It Is to be
sold to the highest bidder and to be
torn down.

Week-End Here
Chiefly through the efforts of local
Southern Pacific Agent G. N. Kramer,
low round-trip week-end fares have
been granted by the Southern Pacific
Company from all stations between
here and Roseburg. This Is to be
come effective on May 20. The rate
is to be a fare and a third. The tick
ets are to be on sale on Saturday and
Sunday of every week after the 20th
and tho return limit is the following
Monday from the date of sale. The
railroad company Is advertising these
rates widely, as Is also the Commer
cial Club. This should make it pos
sible for many more people to visit
the park. The crowds are already
very larce, and with this addition the
park should almost overflow.
This is only one of many things
that the Southern Pacific Company
has done for the springs project. Be
sides giving the rates, they are doing
a great deal of advertising, thus aid
ing the work of the publicity depart
ment. The company has Issued a
special tariff schedule end is covering
the territory between Ashland and
Roseburg.
Report Conditions
On Fire Service
The report of the Underwriters'
Equitable Rating Bureau was read In
the council meeting Tuesday. It was
mainly as follows:
Five hundred feet of new fire hose
are needed and more of the "two-
way" type hydrants. It is essential
to figure maximum conditions in
making preparation for fires. It is
on account of this that the two-way
hydrants are needed. In some of the
outskirts of the town it is almost lm
possible to procure two streams of
water in one neighborhood at the
same time. There is almost always
danger from flying shingles spread
ing a fire, which makes it almost Im
perative to have more than one
stream. Two streams should be
made the minimum. The. mains are
not all large enough to supply pres
sure by two streams. These should
be replaced by new ones as fast as
possible.
The outskirts of town are the
places where the most improvement
is needed. Of course there, there is
not as much danger of the spreading
of fire as in the thickly settled part
of town. This condition should be
improved as the town grows. No fur
ther installations of mains smaller
than four-inch should be made. No
other town the size of Ashland In the
state ls now installing smaller than
four-Inch mains.
The council is taking the steps rec
ommended to put the system In better
condition.
Jury Foreman
Upholds Wilson
Gold Hill, Ore., May 15, 1916.
To the Editor of the Ashland Tid
ings: In a recent issue of the Ashland
Record I note a letter of B. C. Hub
bard, relative to the testimony in the
Martin case, of E. W. Wilson, deputy
sheriff and candidate for the republi
can nomination for sheriff. Having
been foreman of the jury in the Mar
tin case and having heard all the
testimony given at that trial, I desire
to state to the people of Jackson
county that the evidence given by
Wilson was no more material in the
making of our rerdict than that giv
en by other witnesses.
I am In nowise Interested In Mr.
Wilson's campaign, but feel that Mr.
Hubbard's letter was published whol
ly for political purposes and to injure
Mr. Wilson's candidacy for sheriff. .

Mayor Johnson
Explains Action
The following letter read in coun
cil meet'ng explains Mayor Johnson's
attitude in casting his vote on the
side of the negative in regard to the
appropriation of $500 for tho secur
ing of a band for the Fourth of July
ceiebration: ,
"Ashland, Ore., May 13, 1916.
"To the Common Council of the City
of Ashland, Ore.
"Gentlemen: As you are aware, I
have been strongly In favor of donat
ing from the city funds a reasonable
amount toward tho Fourth of July
celebration to be held at this place,
if swell donation could be legally made
from any of the funds of the city. It
seems clear, from the opinion ren
dered by the city attorney, that such
donation would not be a proper ex-
! Iense of the clt7 and consequently
' could not be legally appropriated
from the general fund, even if there
were available money in that fund,
from which such appropriation could
be made, which there Is not.
"The only fund, as I view it, from
which the city could legally appro
priate to this celebration, Is the pub
licity fund. The total amount levied
by the council last December, for pub
licity purposes, amounts to $555. Up
to date the city has only received on
account of taxes collected for this
fund the sum of $158.31. The char
ter provision for tho creation of this
fund provides that out of the fund
the council shall appropriate $300 to
the Chautauqua Association. So far,
there has. only been $50 furnished to
the association, and the ballance of
the fund, so far collected, has been
donated to the Ashland band, leaving
this fund practically depleted.
"It Is plain that we have no money
vailable for the purpose of making
this donation, and that we shall have
to decline doing so, notwithstanding
our great desire to make this celebra
tion a grand success, and to ass'st in
accomplishing that and by all legal
and proper means possible.
- "I am therefore constrained to cast
my vote against making this appro
prlatlon." '
In order that the Springs Dedica
tion celebration may not fall short
of the measure of Immensity which ls
planned, it will be necessary for sev.
eral hundred dollars more to be sub
scribed, following upon the decision
of Mayor Johnson in regard to the
city's appropriating $500 to the fund.
Ashland cannot afford to fall down
on this celebration, and a request for
additional funds should meet with
ready response.
O. H. JOHNSON.
"Mayor of the City of Ashland."

A synopsis of "The Heart of the
World". A little boy who Is des
tined to be a great man Is carried to
the heart of tho world In a dream
and all the myths of all the ages at

the heart of man. lie is shown
Beauty by the Greek myths, Power
by the Saxon myths, Woodcraft and

they' finally tell him it can be found
only on the earth.
Each srone depicts him as besought
to remain in Mythland, but each time
he refuses because they can not show

Sales Company, through W. II. Smith,
has made announcement that it has
been officially advised by the South
ern Pacific railroad officials that the
terminal will be moved from Red
Bluff to Gerber on July 1, 1916. The
company ha3 completed its water and

Singler Endorses
E. W. Wilson
Statement by W. H. Singler In re
gard to candidacy of E. W. Wilson,
who is seeking republican nomina
tion for sheriff:
I have been requested by friends
of law enforcement and clean politics
to submit a statement as to the worlc
of Mr. Wilson in the sheriff's office
during the Incumbency of myself as
sheriff, and in replying I have the
following to offer.
! r- w ,, h" fnr ,1w nnof (.
and one-half years been chief deputy,
directly In chargo of the service and
criminal department of tho ofrico; he
has aiso rendered valuable aid to the
tax department, and during his ro
ginio as deputy, a complete reorgan
ization of tax collections has been in
augurated, tho expense of collections
greatly reduced, better service ren
dered, and a great amount of work
on delinquent taxes done, In an effort
j to collect surh delinquencies.
Three foreclosure suits aggregat
ing $23,000 in behalf of the county
have been instituted, and delinquent
taxes for several years back carried
forward and noted on current tax
rolls.
The vast experience gained by Mr.
Wilson has fitted him to render very
valuable services to the taxpayers,
and I do not believe it advisalilo that
a radical cliango be mado in this im
portant office at this time.
I can say without successful con
tradiction that the sheriff's office Is
in the best condition in tho history
of Jackson county. This is in a great
measure duo to tho untiring efforts
of Mr. Wilson, and I sncerely recom
mend htm to the voters of the county
as a man of exemplnry morals and
habits, and especially fitted to con
duct a rigid enforcement of our new
prohibition statute.
An official audit of all county of
fices recently finished and approved
by the court on March 4, 1916, con
tains the following In regard to tha
sheriff's office:
"Total collections and fees, $366,
904.91. All of these tax collections
have been promptly deposited In the
treasury. The sheriff Is observing
law requiring all delinquents to bar
bronght forward on the current rolls
and entered upon the tax receipts.
This is a huge task, and they are do
ing the work as diligently as possi
ble during the stress of a heavy tax
collection. It Is praiseworthy In the
sheriff to find his office administered
with no bustle or confusion. Only
expert men are employed In the of
fice, In the tax collections and other
departments of the office. And it is
a great pleasure to find Jackson
county coming forward as one of thee
best officered and equipped countios
in the state. Undoubtedly it Is econ
omy to employ only efficient mon in
the office of tax collector. I have
scanned every tax collection and
every fee coming Into the office andt
I find nothing out of place nor en
tered wrongly. This is an unusually
good record."
I believe Mr. Wilson's work merits
your further approval by giving htru
your support In the coming election.
Respectfully submitted,
Adv. W. II. SINGLER.
Preparing for Big
Crowds July 4-5-6
In order to take care of the great
number of people who will come to
Ashland on the dates of the Rogue
River Round-up and Springs Dedica

to put into service every available
room, eating place and space for tents
in the city. D. D. Norris, secretary
of the Commercial Club, has been
placed In charge of this part of the
celebration committee's work and
will nppoint his assistants. The Com
mercial Club office will be headquar
ters for this work, and all who will
be willing to accommodate partlos
with rooms or meals during the three
days are requested to notify Mr. Nor
ris by phone or letter at the ear'Iest
possible moment. Give the number
you will accommodate and your name
and address. Ashland citizens must
rise to the occasion on these three
days and some sacrifice must he made
on the part of a great many in order
to properly prorlde for the many vis
itors. We are rapidly approaching the
period when men can eat pear with,
their knives without being ostracized. .
Don't make yenrself nshanny
trying to be happy.
