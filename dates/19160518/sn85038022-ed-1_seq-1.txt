Tho formal opening was in the even

PILATE, THE MACBETH OF THE! of Richmond, Va.; Mrs. J. J. McMillan,
BIDLE SUBJECT AT YE CELL of Dover; Mr. Webster F. Smith, of
MEETINGS TONIGHT. Peebles. O. A hon. James 11. Smith,
. died nt Dover In 1S97. Mrs. Smith pre-
It was announced that Dr. Yeuell' ceded her husband to the grave In
would have for his subject tonight , 181)8. I'nfortimuiely, Mrs. Burgess Is
"Pilate Tho Macbeth of the Bible", ill at her homo in Illchmond and un
Bolnc as familiar with Shakesnearc as 'able to attend the funeral of lnr fntli-
Is Evangelist Herbert Yeuell, there is
assured all attending the Growers to
night a new and Interesting treatment f
of tho abovo subject.
Last night there were many present
to hear what was said on "Tho Devil
and How Ho Preaches" and none were
disappointed In the way in which tho
subject was developed. "Tho origin of
evil has baffled the philosophers ot
all ages, but who the devil was need
not bother any one. The Blblo speaks
of him as having been an anglo of
light. Ho has or rather Is a person
ality. Why speak of him as an evil
influence only? When there Is a theft
or a murder committed in tho com
munity, the officers of tho law do not
look for the snlrlt of theft or tho snlrlt
of murder they look for a person guil
ty of these crimes. One of the things
the devil preaches Is doubt In the ex
istence ot such n uerson Ho ap
proaches a saint or a sinner at either
ills strongest of at his weukest charac
teristic point." This was Illustrated In
various ways. This sermon proves Dr.
Yeuell to be out of sympathy with the
position taken by the higher critics,
but classes him as an orthodox preach
er. Mr. Karl Yearsley sang two solos,
the aecond being tho "XInety and
Xlne." This was beautifully Illustrated
with stcreoptlcon views. Theso views
which arc used from night to night are
onjoyed and highly complimented by
nil. However they aro not substituted
for the Gospel message which the
evangelist considers to bo the import
ant part of the service.
