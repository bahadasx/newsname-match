REPEATED ATTACKS AT
LAST MEET RESISTANCE
Former Sheriff. Mansker De
cides to Answer Fake Re
ports Circulated by Dem
ocratic Organ
The work of fiction, (inspired by
the democratic bosses of Union county
and written for the most part by an
attorney) which has been running at
intervals as a, serial story in the Clay
ton "News" a, democratic newspaper,
since last July, concerning Robt. T.
Mansker, suspended sheriff of Union
county, reached such a point of bra
zenness in last week's issue of the
"News" that Mr. Mansker's friends
have prevailed on him to make a pub
lic statement in the interests of him
self and interests of real truth and
fairness.
It ia common talk among the better
class of democrats that the manner
in which the "News" is handling the
Mansker suspension case is doing
much injury to the democratic party
in Union county, especially in initiat
ing non-interested parties into the
belief that the repeated rehash of the
case is nothing more nor less than
plain, cheap, democratic political per
secution. Even the ringsters in the
party are not entirely satisfied with
the way the "News" is making thun
der of the case as the "boys" are not
strong for the "News" editor's loose
regard for the truth.
Readers of Mr. Mansker's statement
which follows, will doubtless pardon
him for his plain way of calling the
"News" a liar. This assertion of the
"News'" untruthfulness is rather su
perfluous as District Judge Lieb
through his various opinions in con
nection with the case has done it for
Mr. Mansker.
Mr. Mansker's Statement
"In its issue of May 13th, the Clay.
ton News prints, what it is pleased
to call "Facts, tersely and fairly stat
ed," relative to the case of Sheriff
Mansker. The News has, heretofore
said more or less about this case,
but all of such vaporings were thought
unworthy of reply, because the preju
dice of that paper against me, was so
apparent that I believed that my
friends, and the people generally,
would give that paper's utterances no
consideration. But, this last issue mis
represents the facts so grossly that I
have felt it necessary to make this re
ply. "The law says, that in cases where
officers are suspended, that they shall
have the benefit of a preferential trial
by a jury; and that such case shall
have the preference oven all other
cases on the docket. Now, I was sus
pended from office July 13, 1915, and
I had the legal right to a préferential
trial by the jury of the September,
1915, term of the District Court. When
I was suspended I immediately em
ployed attorneys, and instructed them
particularly, to do everything possible
to get me a hearing before a jury at
the September term. My case was
set for hearing the first jury day of
the September term of court; and I
was ready for the hearing, and my at
torneys so announced in open court
but the state was not ready to give
me trial, and wanted to continue the
case to the next terrA of the court
so that my books could .be officially
audited by the State Traveling Audit
or; and that if such audit should show
that I was not short in my accounts
with the county, that there would be
little or nothing left of the charges
made against me. And my belief was
that I would be re-instated in office
if my books were officially found to be
correct. So, I finally, but reluctantly,
agreed that the case might be continu
ed for the principal purpose of allow
ing my books to be officially audited.
Whereupon, the court made an, order
continuing the case for the term,
which order speaks for itself and is
as follows:

and the "boys" keep the money coming; I'll continue to
they gotta keep the cash coming."
The Great Democratic offensive started with last week's
campaign is being conducted in a highly intellectual manner by the two poitly.gentlemen
at the top of the picture General Fuller Bull and Colonel Bunk, jointly representing the
Democratic party in Union county. Messrs Bull and Bunk have the keys to the county
Cash Register. They also dictate the policy of the job commissary and with a hint from
General Bull and a vague promise from Col Bunk aspiring attorneys will supply enough
political ammunition to load
pulls the string providing
eral simoleons.
Private Salve of The Snooze continues to insult the intelligence of his readers by insist
ing editorially that this, the third or fourth rehash of the "sheriff case" is NOT political
persecution, but a high, noble, virtuous and sincere desire to herald the truth to an unen
lightened world.
The little man with the muzzle-loading gun is La Onion. He plays second-fiddle on
Union County's Cash Register.
The field piece in the dim distance is the Swastika. This gun is not "hep" to Union
County political warfare, hence its aim is bad, as you may have observed from the antics
of the mule.
Herzstein Has New Cash Register
Simon Herzstein and his ready-to
wear store is sporting a new cash
register that is capable of secreting
all the loose change one person is like
ly to have around the house. Beside
this very essential feature the register
records each salesman's sale, and the
total day's business. There is a com
partment for each clerk up to five.
The affair is very handsome, having
the appearance of a swell Victrola
but it won't play unless you drop a
jitney in the slot then its's an awful
short selection.

JAMES SAYS TWO WARD
SCHOOLS TOO COSTLY
Tax Payers' Association Be
comes Interested in Plans
to Locate Clayton's Pro
posed High School
Clayton's proposed High school and
the varied controversies as a sequence
of the Board of Education contracting
lor the purchase of a site has attract
ed attention of Director James of the
New Mexico Taxpayers' Association.
Local council member G. G. Granville
submitted the following from himself
for publication together with a letter
from Director James on the situation:
Editor of the Clayton Citizen,
vmyion, new Mexico.
"By way of explanation I would
suggest for the information of the
readers of The Citizen that the "Tax
rayers .association" is an organiza
tion of citizens from all parts of the
state of New Mexico. It has for its
object and Durnose the nrnteitinn nt
the tax-paying public of the state from
injudicious ana wasteiui expenditure
of public monies, from excessive and
unwise taxation, and from inequitable
apportionment of the tax burdens of
the state, and its several subordinate
municipal organizations.
"The work is in charge of A..E.
James, Director, of Santa Fe, New
Mexico. Mr. James is an expert in
tax matters, and any suggestions that
he has to offer are worthy of most
careful consideration. He is employ
ed by the Association and devotes his
time to the investigation and study
of matters pertaining to taxation, with
a view to assist the tax payers of the
state.
The central organization of the Tax
Payers' Association is composed of
one member from each county of the
state, and is called the "general coun
cil. Through no choice of mine I have
been designated ns the representative
of Union county, and for that reason
the letter printed herewith was ad
dressed to me.
Respectfully yours,
G. G. Granville."
Mr. G. G. Granville.
Clayton, New Mexico.
Dear Sir:
"I have been watching with interest
the high school building matter in
Clayton.
The Clayton high school, in the year
101 1-15 had only 12 pupils in the two
highest grades as against 455 in the
primary to the tenth grades inclusive.
From these figures it would seem that
there might be danger of developing
in Clayton, a top-heavy high school
before the demand for this instruction
has been built up.
"iMay 1 suggest that the two-school
proposal seems hardly sound or war
ranted. In the long run is it not most
important that the school house shall
be as close as possible to the probable
center of population in the school dis
trict : While i am not familiar with
Clayton, unless conditions are very
unusual, it hardly seems desirable to
have two school houses with complete
grade equipment and teachers in a
district containing no more than 500
pupils. The cost of schools i nthe
long run may be expressed in just
two words teachers' wages.
The more centrally the school can be
located the more pupils an individual
teacher can be eiven, the cheaper will
be the operation of the schools and the
more efficient will be their manage
ment. Multiplication of school houses
means a large increase in the teaching
force. If two schools are desirable
may I suggest that one of them should
undertake no more than the primary
and first or second grades and the
main work with all of the other pupils
be centralized in the other school.
The enrollment by grades for the
year ending in 1915 was:
Primary 76
First ?f
Second ... - 4J
Third b-2
Fourth 69
Fifth - f
Sixth ii
Seventh 'J
Eighth I
Ninth 29
Tenth 1? .
Eleventh J
Twelfth ---- 3
You will note that one teacher for
each can easily handle the 5th 6th,
7th and 8th grades. The grades up to
the 4th are considerably crowded if
handled by only one tencher each. A
grade school separate from the main
school might properly he established,
with two or three teachers to relieve
the congestion in the lower grades.
While I have not been in Clayton I
have consulted parties acquainted with
the local conditions and from all I
can gather, the present school is bet
ter located for the high school than
would be any school on any of the pro
posed sites. Why not, therefore, use
