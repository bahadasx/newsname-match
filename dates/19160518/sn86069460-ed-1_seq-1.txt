The Organization of District Tuber
culosii Sanatoria and
County Health.
Colonel L U. Maus. Secretary
, of the State Tuberculosis Com
mission, visited Marion Thurs
day in the interest of the State
Tuberculosis Campaign. H e
says that Kentucky loses f,KX5
men, women and children every
year from consumption, and that
40,000 of the people still have
the disease, and that many of
them will pass away unless
something is done for their care
and treatment.
Kentucky stands almost at the
top of the States in the Union in
the prevalency of tuberculosis,
and near the bottom in the ex
penditure of money to suppress
the disease. Colonel Maus has
divided the state into nine tuber
culosis santorium districts, each
district to contain from 12 to 15
counties. He says that the coun
ty sanitorium idea has been
abandoned by the commission as
unpractical and too expensive,
The district plan contemplates
the construction of a central san
itorium, built of frame and not to
cost over $30,000. The different
counties in the district will be
taxed 5 or C per cent of their
annual county tax levy for this
purpose. Each sanitorium will
be provided with 2M beds, which
are considered sufficient for the
needs of each district Besides
the organization of district sani
toria, Col. Maus is trying to or
ganize health and welfare league
in every county in the state.
These leagues will be general in
nature and include every man
and woman in the county inter
ested in the health and welfare
of their communities. It is be
lieved that fully two-thirds of
the citizens of each county will
join the league and pay the an
nual dues of one dollar toward
the work of the league.
Colonel Maus addressed a mass
meeting of the people in the
court house Thursday May the
11th, and the school children
Friday morning. He went to
Frinceton from Marion to look
over the situation there, and
then returned to Frankfort
Colonel Maus is a retired officer
of the army medical corps and
spent over forty years In the ser
vice of his country. He went to
Cuba with Gen. Fitz-hugh Lee
as chief surgeon of the seventh
army corps, and later served in
tne rniinpine islands. He was
the first Commissioner of public
health for the Phillipines and
t had charge of the great epidem .
ic there of cholera, bubonic
plague, small pox, and leprosy
Mrs. Lottie iinsiry lerry was
called to Kuttawa Sunday on ac
count of her little daughter having
had a hemorhage, she returned
Sunday afternoon as the child was
better, .

ARTICLE ON
Good Roads, By Oiie of Out' o&t
Progressive Farmers,
. W.R. Cruce.
Editor of the Kecord-Press: '
1 have read the call in your pa
per, for an election to be held,
May 27th, 191(1, to takethesen.se
of the voters of Crittenden coun
ty as to the isHual of bonds to the
amount of . $185,000.00 for the
building of maradam roads in
trie county under the State aid
plan, and have read with much
interest, the various articles for
and against the proposition.
We all realize the value of good
roads in any county, especially
to the farmers, who have to haul
their produce to market, and the
necessity for some improvements
in the roads of Crittenden coun
ty. No one can truthfully say
that we have as good roads as
we should.
As I am a farmer and greatly
interested in this matter I am
taking the liberty of suggesting
a few thoughts that occur to me
relative to the proposition.
I notice, from the contributed
article, of those opposed to the
proposition, that great stress is
aid upon the fact that the debt
is too great for our people to as
sume and that our taxes will be
greatly increased. It is true
that $185,000.00 is a large sum
and if we only consider the debt
without taking ' into considera
tion the assessed value of our
county, it looks like a bavy bur
den, but when we consider the
part that each of us will be call
ed upon to pay, it is not enough
to alarm any one. The tax can
not exceed 20 cents on the $100
worth of property, or '2.00 per
$1000. For instance, if one pays
taxes on $1000 worth of proper
ty. it will only cost him $2.00
per year; and, if he pays on
$500.00 worth of property, it will
only cost him $100 per year. If
a voter pays taxes on $1000.00
worth of property and he be-
ieves the road would benefit
him more than $2.00 per year,
he should be for the tax; but if
he believes that it will not bene
fit him as much as $2.00 per year,
he ought to be against it
But some say it will increase
our other taxes by making our
property more valuable and that
t . ! 1 ...
win not mane me properly
produce any more. According
to that theory, we ought not to
build school houses nor churches
in the community, for, every one
will admit that ' schools and
churches make neighborhoods
more desirable and the property
more valuable. Neither should
we build good comfortable homes,
or other improvements, for they
all make farms more valuable
without increasing the fertility
of the soil.
It is also said that "we do not
know that the State will or can
continue to aid us." The State
agrees to pay one-half of the
debt More than 100 counties
of the State have arranged for
State aid, and it is not reason
able to think their represent
tives will not see to it that the
State will pay its part
In addition to the agreement
upon the part of the State to pay
half of the indebtedness, the
f ederal Government has passed
an Act by which this State wi
receive about $1,500,000.00 to be

To Those Suffering With
Nerve And Eye Trouble.
Will s ty that I have studied the
McCormick system some and I
think it great I have also been
treated by that system by Dr.
Gilchrist of Marion, Ky. for a
i lacerated retina and nerve trou

am sure could not have been
accomplished under any other
system. I practiced medicine
successfully for many years and
'The Healing Art,, in many of
it's branches and I believe if Dr.
Gilchrist's advice is followed vou
will get the results you have a
right to expect. I am,not interest

New Foreman At The
Record-Press Office.
Several of our friends in the
town and county have asked us
how we get out such a good pap
er and on time after losing our
breman, Malcolm Dollar. We
should have announced that we
had given Mr. Dollar's place to
our former foreman. Hodge S.
McNeely, who is thoroughly com
petent to get out the paper, or
any other job work entrusted to
our care. .
Every printer at work in Mari
on and many other parts of the
United States, who have gone
rom our little city seeking green
er fields, made their start in the
ress office and we are proud of
them. A letter to the editor re
ceived from Malcohn Dollar
states he is pleased with his new
work. He is in Corinth, Miss.,
this week.
Cap Exploded.
Coy, the little thirteen-year old
son of Cyrus Moore, of Flatrock,
happened to a very painful acci
dent last Sunday afternoon. He
was playing in the road near his
home, when he found a dynamite
cap and not knowing what it was
he began playing with it and in
some way it was discharged, tear
ing off the end of his thumb and
three fingers on his left hand.
Dr. W. P. Morse of Farmers ville,
was immediately summoned, and
dressed the wound, and tha little
fellow was doing as . well as
could be expectedtat last report.
