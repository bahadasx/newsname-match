TREATMENT FOR
CITY'S FUN
First of Three Inoculations
Will Be Given To
morrow.
In accordance with the most modern
ideas of disease prevention the Fair
mont Fire department employes are
to receive an Immunizing typhoid
treatment This treatment for, thepye
has been successfully used for manjr
years In ttie. United States ' army and
the National Guard. But unlike the
smallpox vaccination treatment tho
use of prophylactic doses of typhoid
vaccine does not cause pain or soro
ness and the patient receiving the
treatment is not forced to cease his
regular work by ariy ill effects of the
vaccination.
This Immunizing treatment reduces
the danger of contracting typhoid in
fection to a negligible minimum for a
poriod lasting from one to three years.
Usually however two years is consid
ered tho safe limit for the duration
of the Immunization
Every member of the local Fire De
partment was unanimous in the desire
to receive this treatment and the step
was decided upon by the City Health
officials by request of tho firemen.
Three doses of vaccine are usually
injected into *Iie patients who desire
typhoid prophylaxis, at Intervals of
nine to eleven days. The first dose
will be given the firemen tomorrow.

Sends Communication to
General Consuls.
(By Associated Press)
WASHINGTON, May 18?Germany
through Count von Bernstorff has in
structed all Gorman conaula In the
United StnteB to admonish German
citizens in their districts scrupulously
10 observe American law. This wait
done in an effort to end various al
leged violations of American neutral
ity.
The nmba3sador acted on instruc
tions from the Berlin foreign office.
The action was announced today in
this official statement from the embas
sy.
"In consequence of cases which
have occurred of late the Ger
man ambassador has sent instruc
tions to all German T consuls In
the United States to strongly Im
press upon all German citizens
living In their districts that It is
their duty to obey the laws of
the state in which they reside.
It was said that the Gorman embas
sy instructions were designed to pre
vent plots or lawlessness on the part
of German citizens who might be dis
posed to engage in such.
The German government, It was said
looks with great disfavor upon any
such conduct and desires that they
shall not engage in any undertaking
in any way outsldo of the law. It was
not disclosed whether specific cases
have been brought to the atentlon of
the German government, but It was
made clear that Berlin officials want
the United States and its people to
understand that they had not counte
nanced any illegal affairs with which
German citizens or sympathizers fn
this country have been connected.
Count von Bernstorffs instructions
were received last night and were
forwarded immediately to German
consuls.??

going over the streets" of Stealey
Heights uear Clarksburg with a view
of determining If a- line from Clarks
burg to that town would be justified.
Stealey Heights Is located on the
homes of the Stealey families, and be- j
tween the Weston and Adamston lines
just west of the old fair grounds at
Clarksburg and while practically a
new town, already has something like
2,000 inhabitants. Approximately 100
new homes were built last year and
more than B0 aro undGr construction
this year. There are prospects of it
becoming a very large town In the
next few years.
The Traction company officials
found the grades and curves a serious
obBtacle and hard to overcome, so
that no decision was reached but the
engineers were instructed to prepare
a survey, after which It would be eas
ier to determine whether a lino would
be built at this time.
