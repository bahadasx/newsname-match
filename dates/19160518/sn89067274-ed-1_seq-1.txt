"Everyone likes him there and I be
lieve he will be re-elected without op

meeting there recently. Mr. Turner

all backed off the boards and ho did
not use quotations when he stole the
slang that Mr. Sunday uses so appropriately.

The new president, Mrs. C. C. Ham
mond, who waa elected bt fill the un
expired term of Mrs. 3. E. Durkee,
who moved away from Mexico, presi
ded in a most able and handsome man
ner, and bids fair to make an enter-
getic and forceful officer of great
executive ability. -
After the transaction of business,
the meeting was turned over to the U.
D. C. who were the hostesses for the
day. The ladies had decorated the
room with national and Confederate
flags and great bowls of flowers so
that the room wore a most attractive
and festive air.
The president of the V. D. C, Mrs.
E. R. Miller, in her graceful way in
troduced the numbers on the program.
Mrs., W, W. Pollock read a poem
entitled "The Old Time fligger" in so
realistic and charming a manner that
one beheld the old darky paying the
tribute of love and allegiance to his
white folks. ' (
A quartet composed pf Mesdames
Dry, Carter, Locke and Wilkina, sang
that lovely "old" song, "Sweet and
Low," after which Mrs.lMiller intro
duced the state president of the U.
D. C, Mrs. C. B. Faris of Jefferson
City, who spoke on "The Inspiration
and Aspiration of the U J). C"
Mrs. Faris charmed the audience
by her own personality as much as
by what she said. She is a lovely
young woman, although she has a
grown daughter, and her manner Is
at once sincere, simple, and genial.
Mrs. Faris paid a tribute of love
and remembrance to the southern sol
diers who fought with so much valor
for their cause. The fine educational
work now being done by the U. D. C.
was also stressed, and explained by
Mrs. Faris. Worthy young women

U D C.
Mr Roy Ferris spoka before the
Federation in behalf of the movement
to obtain a scout master for the Boy
Scouts for the three summer months
of school vacation. Mr. Ferris in his
timid and modest way made an elo
quent and earnest plea for the inter
est of the women in the boys of the
town who are not receiving the care
interest and protection which they
should have and which a young man
of fine character might, or rather,
would give the time. This man would
not only seek to win the boys from
harmful amusements and supervise
their spare time, but would obtain
work for those who want it during
the summer vacation -
Mrs. J. W. Crewdson, of Louisiana,
who is a member of the Mexico U.
D. C, spoke a few words endorsing
the plea of Mr. Ferris and -paid a
hieh tribute to the Boy Scouts of
her town, saying they were the ones
who were always called upon when
the women wanted anything done, as
they were ever ready and eager to
be of help without hope of reward
The afternoon closed with a social
hourf and refreshments of a luscious
nature served by the ladies of the U.
D. C.

A Well Known Judge
of Probate Says:
Pool Hall License Granted
The Audrain County Court has
granted a licenso to O. H. Brown to
open pool hall. It will likely be lo
cated in the Mayfield building on the
southwest corner of the square, and
will open shortly.
Property accumulated by yean of toil often shrinks with amazing
rapidity in the hands of incompetent administrators, and the bene
ficient provisions of wills are in many cases defeated.
The modern Trust Company is readily displacing the personal
executor or administrator, and the advantages it offers should be
seriously considered by the man who would protect the interests
of his heirs. '
