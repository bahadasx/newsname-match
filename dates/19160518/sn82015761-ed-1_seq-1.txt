WILLIAMS, COCONINO COUNTY, ARIZONA. THURSDAY, MAY 18, 1916
Number 25
OFFICE OF THE COUNTY
RECORDER
Flag. Ari. May 5th, 1916
The
Election Laws of
Arizona
provide for the complete registra
tion of all electors in the state
every two years on the even year.
In compliance with the require
ments of this law registration for
the November election will begin
at the office of the County
Recorder on the first day of
May, and will continue until
ten days before the County
primary election, or until Septem
ber 1st at 5 o'clock P. M., at which
time the books will be closed for
seventeen dajTs, and no registra
tions will be made until Septem
ber ISth, at which time the books
will again Ve open and registering
continue until October 15th, when
it will be closed until May 1st, 1918.
The qualifications of electors are
as follows: Must be twenty-one
years of age or over; a citizen of
the United States, either by birth'11 woukl Do satisfactory to open the
or naturalization; a resident of ! books to the -committee. He slates
Arizona for one year prior to elec- I that he exPcts a reply before Sat
tion. and of the Countv and Pre-! urday anrl tnat he thinks tie
7 - - j
cinct for thirty days; must be able
to read the Constitution of the
United States in the English
language and write his or her
name, unless physically unable to
do so.
If elector is a naturalized citizen
he must present his second or
final papers to the registration
officer, else he can not be register
ed. If, however, such papers are
lost or destroyed, the elector will
be permitted to register upon ex
ecuting and filing with the register
ing officer an affidavit giving the
time, place and court of issuance
of 6uch pupers, and the fact of
their loss or destruction and cir
cumstances connected therewith.
The above applies to women a3
well as men, except that women of
foreign birth become naturalized
citizens upon their marriage' to
citizens of the United States either
by birth or naturalization, or if
already married, the naturalization
of the husband carries with it citi
zenship of the wife. On the other
hand when 'a woman who is a
citizen of the United States, either
by birth or naturalization, marries
ar. alien, her citizenship ceases
with suoh marriage. In short, the
citizenship of the wife is that of
the husband.
Electors must rpgister in the
precinct where they reside, to en
able them to vote at any primary
or election. The law by which a
person, if not on the register, could
register at the polls, has been
omitted from the code now in force,
and in order to vcte at any prim
ary or election, the elector's name
MUST appear on the register of
the precinct wherein he or she re
sides. If, after registering, the
elector moves to another precinct
or county, he or she must cancel
such registration and then re-register
in the precinct or county where
elector then resides. A person
must not register mora than once.
without first cancelling any urior
registration. To fraudulently regis
ter more than once or to knowing
ly register in any precinct where
he is not a resident at the time of
registering, is a criminal offense and
subjects the offender to a fine in a
sum not exceeding two thousand
dollars, or imprisonment not ex
ceeding three years or both.
EVE R YBODY M UST REGIS
TER THIS YEAR if they wish to
vote at the primary election on
September 12 th oral the general
election on November
(It), or at
any other election that may be
held within the next two years.
No registration of former yeara
will tuffice.

MASS MEETING CONSIDERS
MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP
A mass meeting of citizens was
held at the Sultana Theater after
the show last Friday night, for
the purpose of considering munici
pal ownership of the "Williams
Water and Electric Company. A
good attendance was present and
after a discussion of the question,
a committee composed of Messrs.
Kirkpatrick, Rittenhouse , and
Williams was apDointed to caVry
on a further investigation of the
question. Another mass meeting
will be held at the Parish House
Saturday night, May 20.
The committee appointed has
conferred with Mr. Morley, general
manager of the company, and ask
ed to be permitted to examine the
books in order to learn the amount
of revenue at present and to deter
mine the value of the present
plant. Mr. Morley at once wrote
i. t . -ti" j r 1 (
l" Ule "" iiers ' unica-o io nnu ii
owners will give their consent.
This is an important question
and all those interested, both men
and women, should make an effort
to be prejeut at the meeting Sat
urday in order t- give the ques
tion full and unbiased considera
tion. Vote for Bobby Burns,

'Motto
Owing to the heavy vote in the
town of Williams, this territory
has been redisiricted, making 2
voting precincts instead of 1 as in
1914. Consequent to such changes
made in the precincts, there could
be confusion in registering proper
ly, and to avoid possible mistakes
I have hrrangtd that registration
'officers who are familiar - with the
maps and boundaries of the new
precincts will conduct the registra
tion in and from this ollije for the
Williams precinct. You may reg
ister before F. M. Gold, Registra
tion Officer and F. 0. Twitty, Jus
tice of Peace.
This office will make every effor
to properly register all legal voters
before the primary election. The
public can aid materially in our
work by registering as soon after
May first as possible.
An amendment to the regiftra
tion laws made by the last legis
lature provides that the elector
when registering shall give his
party affiliation, or say that he has
none, if such is the case. Any
elector refusing to give his party
affiliation can not register. If he
has no party affiliation he may so
state, and in order to register,
this question m the registration
b'ank must be answered. This
giving a party affiliation does not
affect the elector at the general
election but is an important factor
at the primary for selection of
candidates for the general election,
for unless a uartv affiliation is
j given the e,ector WJU not be per.

waiting for the hose department to
arrive, those men in the near
vicinity set to work with buckets
and had the fire extinguished be
fore the hose was run out. The roof
and walls of the shed were of gal
vanized iron roofing, and it was
largely due to this fact, that the
fire was so easily extinguished.
The action of the fire department
was prompt and had the fire prov
ed too much for the men with
buckets, the departrrent would
soon have had it under control.
