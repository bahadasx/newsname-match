Around the Wreckage.
Akron, O.?Nine persons were killed
ind a score injured when the old Deacon
Journal building, occupied by the
Crystal Restaurant, collapsed as a result
of a blast of dynamite in an ad1
" Joining evacuation.
Seven identified bodies have been recovered
and two unidentified have
been recovered and two persons, now
missing, are thought to be in the
ruins.
Battery B, Ohio National Guard
Field Artillery, was called out to aid
the police in restraining a crowd of
more than 10,000 persons who packed
the streets where the accident occurred.
A tremendous roar, echoing the
screams of dying people, brought
thousands to the scene, In the heart
of Akron's business district. Inatanly
the entire city, rallying under the
shock, plunged to the work of rescue.
A great pile of ruins, broken timbers,
twisted steel and tons of brick and
mortar buried, the victims, who a
moment before were dining in the
restaurant.
U. S. TROOPS ARE SENT
TO GUARD BORDER BRIDGES.
Along Southern Pacific Between El
Paso and San Antonio.
San Antonio Texas. ? The safeguarding
of the Southern Pacific Hailway
from here to El Paso was docid
ed upon and troops are being sent to
every bridge along the line. In the
v- event of military operations on a big
scale the use of the railroad would be
imperative. For a great part of the
^ distance the line parallels the Rio
Grande and unless guarded the cutting
would be comparatively simple.
It is declared.
Major General Funston and his staff
worked out many details of tho plan
of re-organization of the border patrol.
Reports from General Pershing
showed his troops have been drawn
closer together and gave no sign that
early resumption of the chase of Frail
cisco Villa was contemplated. Colonel
Sibley in the Big Bend section is
driving his little command of cavalry
oome liO miles south of nomiillas hut
at headquarters there is displayed
little hope that he will capture the
bandits who attacked Monquillas and
Glenn Springs, or rescue Jesse Deemer,
and American carried away by
them.
ENGLAND DONT ACCEPT
PEACE OVERTURES
London^?"The latest peace overcures,
said to be of German origin,
while not as insolent and impossible
as previous statements on the same
subject, certainly do not yet offer a
basis for negotiations," said Lord
Robert Cecil, Minister of War Trade
In discussing with the Associated
Press the latest reputed German
peace terms. Lord Roberts continued
:
"We have never received, either
officially or unofficially, any direct
peace suggestions from Germany and
the only indirect overtures we are
ware of appear in the speeches of
Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg
and the recent German note to America.
We would not think of discussing
or even considering any overtures
without consulting our Allies. No formal
or informal conference for the
purpose ever has taken place.
"In diplomatic procedure, a neutral
is hardly likely to make any suggestion
of peace terms unless cartaln
they are acceptable to the recipient.
"If Germany should decide to approach
us through the medium of the
United States, the latter would have
to use Its own judgment as to wheth
er or not to deliver ?he request."

Already forces at border stations l
have been strengthened and it was I
indicated that before the end of the
week the greater part of the regular
troops and militia that have been sent |\
into the three border states would be
prepared and in position for quick
service along the international line.
It is improbable that more troops
will be sent to Colonel Sibley in
charge of the little expedition that c
crossed into Mexico near Boquillas as
a result of the raid at Glenn Springs
and Boquillas a week ago. Four detachments
are now operating close to
the lines, scouting through" a limited
territory south of ;he border, but there v
never has been any intention of send- ^
ing forward at that point a punitive *
expedition that would compare in size ^
to that of General Pershing in the '
State of Chihouhun. a

Advocates of adequate National de- f

u Mexico came to an end without any
igreoment being reached.
The matter was referred hack to

With tha negotiations here ended

s now stated positively that the Mexean
Government, so far as that part
epresented by General Carranza is
ioncerned, has not for one instant
idmitted the consideration of auy oth>r
subject than withdrawal.
The situation is almost exactly
vhere it stood beforo the conferences

itill insists on the withdrawal of Geu;ral
Pershing's columns upon a cerain
date and wants that date to come
luickly.

received by the state department by s'
cablo from Ambassador Gerard, ad- n;
mits that a German submarine torpedoed
the channel 9teamer Sussex in tl
violation of assurances given the 'I:
United States, expressed regret for | >
the Incident, announces that the sub-1 01
marine commander has boen "appro- M
priately punished" and declares reaui- O
ness to pay an adequate indemnity to
Americans injured on the vessel. v;
It was indicated at the state dopartment
that the German statement '
that the offending commander had (
been punished would be accepted, 11
and the Susex case considered closed
except for arranging for the payment
of indemnities to the several citizens 11
of the United State* who were hurt. a
There probably will be no attempt to 1
negotiate for these indemnities or for 0
final settlement of the Lusltania and n
other cases pending, however, until ^
sufficient times has elapsed to indicate
how the last American note was
received in Berlin and whether the p
new submarine policy is being lived
up to.
Results of an investigation, based
on facts supplied by the American a
government, the German communica- A
tion says, has shown that the conten- ri
tion originally set up that the explo- t<
sion on the Sussex was to be traced lc
to a cause other than a Gorman sub- n
marine attack, cannot be maintained, tl

commander thought he was dealing
wun an enemy warship. Foreign Min- u

The number of German casualties
since the beginning of the war is given
as 2,822.079. These figures were p
given in the following statement:

OF EL PASO CONFERENCE. b'
Washington.?Further developments !
in the Mexican situation await a defl- b
nite oucome of the El Paso conference
between Generals Scott, Funston and G
Obregon. nr
Officials here thought it unlikely
President Wilson would accept any i B
agreement that looked to withdrawal j
of the American troops, even with j
promises that a complete patrol of j
the Mexican side would be established i
by the De Facto Government. The 11
course of General Obregon at El Paso j T
has been puzzling to Administration ?<
oqlcials, who believe that General r<
Carranza has given his assent to the tl
agreement as originally framed except H
, in minor details. In some quarters it ?
was thought the Mexican War Minis-i
tor might be seeking political benefit { o
from the tactics he had adopted.

A matter of importance to be pass
ed upon by the grand lodge is the
proposed establishment by the supremo
lodge of a sanatorium for tuberculosis
somewhere in the Southwest.
A special committee was appointed

question this year. Another matter
that probably will come up is the selection
of a permanent meeting place
for the grand lodge. This question
has been discussed tor a number of
years, but no action has ever been
taken. It is said the grand lodge Is
a business convention and has grown
to be such a large body that it should
havo a central meeting place, where
tho knights may gather every year.
