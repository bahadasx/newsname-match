edy of the life of little Anna Blockus
was spelled yesterday when Dr. Rob-
ert Skoda, 2647 Orchard st, was
forced to pay a $100 fine in the court
of domestic relations for contributing
to the girl's downfall.

started was hardly mentioned during
the trial It was Hillman's depart
ment store. It would help a great
' deal if the waiting rooms of depart
ment stores weer watched closer.
lit the waiting room of the State
street store Anna met Helen Martin,
also a child, as she strayed into the
place to "kill time" while seeking a
Job one day a few months ago.
Helen- had been there before and
she told Anna, things that made her
big blue eyes open wide and led he
feet away from the waiting room o
the loop store to the office of the doc
tor. There money could be made
easily, the Blockus girl was old, and
a good time was to be found.

happened there sent her out of the
office happy that she had escaped
ruin. But hse says it was by a nar
row margin that she got by.

room figured in the girl's history
came when she paid tehp lace an
other visit This time she was "flat
broke" and had been out of work for
some time. The girl was too tired to
care, and as she sat in a chair in Hill
man's she was again approached by
a woman.
