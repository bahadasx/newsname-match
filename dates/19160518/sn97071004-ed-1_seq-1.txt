PRESIDENT WILSON ACCEPTS BERLIN'S
REPLY TO SUBMARINE ULTIMATUM
Washington, D. C A note cabled
by Secretary Lansing to Ambassador
Gerard Tuesday for delivery to the
Berlin foreign office informs the Ger
man government that the United
States accepts its "declaration of
abandonment" of its former submarine
policy and now relies upon a scrupu
lous execution of the altered policy to
remove the principal danger of an In
terruption of the good relation exist
ing between the two countries.
With this acceptance is coupled
formal notice to Germany that the
United State cannot for a moment en
tertain, much less discuss, a sugges
tion that respect by German naval au-
thorities of the right of citizens of
the United States on the high seas
should In the slightest degree be made
contingent upon the conduct of any
other government affecting the rights
of neutrals and noncorobatants.
This is in reply to the concluding
statement in the Isst German note to
the effect that while submarine com
mander had been ordered not to sink
peaceful freight or passenger-carrying
ships without warning or without
saftey for passengers and crew, the
German government would reserve to
itself complete liberty of decision un
less the United States wa successful
in its effort to break the British
blockade.
funston to Send Troops on Hot
Trail of Mexican Border Outlaws
Washington, D. C Administration

stated officially that General Funston
ha full authority to send his troop
across the border on any hot trail.
Secretary Baker conferred with
President Wilson Tuesday evening, but
be said later there had been no devel
opement In the situation. He declined
to discuss what step had been taken
by General Funston of what recom
mendations he had made.
Officials would not comment on bor
der advices saying General Funston
had repeatedly urged that his forces be
strengthened. The question of calling
out a portion of the National guard Is
not under immediate consideration,
however, and as the only means of
adding materially to the border guard
would be to employ coast artillery
troops a infantry for that purpose,
there is nothing to indicate that Gen
eral Funston's force is to be increased.
Senator Borah issued a statement
urging that additional troops be or
dered to the border, and that any man
or party in Mexico which sought to
embarrass the task of protecting
American interests be treated as an
enemy of the country.

on the war and terrified by the indig
nities and hatred they have stirred up
in mankind, are trying today to make
the world believe that the entente al
lies alone are responsible for the pro
longation of hostilities a dull irony
which will deceive no one.
"Neither directly nor indirectly have
our enemies offered us peace. But we
do not want them to offer it to us; we
want them to ask it of us. We do not
want to submit to their conditions;
we want to impose ours on them. We
do not want a peace which would leave
imperial Germany with the power to
recommence the war and keep Europe
eternally menaced.
"So long as that peace is not assured
to us; so long as our enemies will not
recognize themselves as vanquished,
we will not cease to fight"

bers of the ways and means committee

quickly as possible, however. Other

ent exemption limit for incomes, $3000
for unmarried and $4000 for married
men, none of the details of the tax
plan have been worked out

English Beer Output Cut;
Oregon Hop Market Affected
Portland The export demand for
hops is not going to be a much of a
factor in the coming season as in past
years, unless the war is brought to a
close, as production of beer in England
is to be limited.
Word has been received from Lon
don that arrangements have been made
between the British government and
the Brewers' society to reduce the
beer output from April 1, 1916, by 28
per cent of the output of the year
ended September 80, 1914. The aim
of this restriction Ib to reduce the im
portation of brewing materials by
33 1-3 per cent though no direct steps
will be taken to restrict the importa
tion of materials.
At the moment there is a very good
market at all points on the Coast and
prices are, if anyhting, steadier than
last week.
The Furnish crop of 195 bales at
Reedville was bought by Ralph E.
Williams at 104 cents. - Offers as high
as 11 cents were made for good Ore
gons in other sections.
The Chamberlain lot or ize bales at
Chehalis was purchased by Harry L.
Hart at 10J cents. Another important
Western Washington deal was the sale
of 360 bales of the Klaber crop at Che
halis at 11 cents. In Yakima orders
at 11 cents are going unfilled. Only
five crops remain unsold in the Yakima
section.
In Sonoma, where unsold stocks are
reduced to 8000 bales, bids are out at
11 and 12 cents. The sale by Mrs.
Duncan of 115 bales of Sonomas at 11
cent is reported. Hofer & Johnson
sold 99 bales of Mendocinos, but the
price was not wired. Marks bought
the Gerber crop of 263 bales of Sacra
mento at 9) cents.
Fruit Damage Is Now Feared.
Marshfield, Or. Fear is felt here
for the fruit crop, particularly berries,
in the finish of the present storm,
which commenced five days ago. The
weather has been cold and much hail
has fallen at intervals. Srawberries
which are about coming into market
will be injured unless there is a sudden
ending of the storm. Nearly three
and a half inches of precipitation is
the record for five days.
BIG PARADE VOICES
U.S. PREPAREDNESS
New York Demonstration Has
150,000 isi Line of March.
All QASSES IN PATRIOTIC PAGEANT
Twelve Hours of Mankind Pass Re
viewing Stand Great Awaken
ing Is Shown by People.
New York New York expressed It
attitude on the question of national
preparedness Saturday by holding the
greatest civil parade in the history of
the country. An almost countless host
of men and women, estimated at more
than 150,000, representing all walks
of life in the nation' metropolis,
marched for 12 hours, 20 abreast, be
hind bands playing patriotic airs,
through flag-bedecked street lined
with hundreds of thousands of cheer
ing spectators.
All the profession and trade which
make up the complex life of the city
were represented.
In one division were the street
sweepers in their uniform of white,
while in another were the dignified
justices of the Supreme court of New
York.
There also were the clergy nearly
200, representing every denomination
in the nation' greatest city. Law
yers, physicians, trained nurses, vet
eran of the Spanish-American war,
were in line. But the most popular
division was made up of the city' 10,
000 National Guardsmen infantry,
cavalry and artillery who brought up
the rear.
"This," declared Major General.
Leonard Wood, in command .of : the de-
pertinent of the East who reviewed
the parade, "is the greatest argument
America has ever known in favor of
preparedness against elements that are
at present unknown. It shows an in
terest in preparedness that amounts to
a National awakening. This is what
we need. It shows that the time has
come to do something in the matter of
National preparation."
The mammoth pageant began au
spiciously. Just as Mayor Mitchell
and a party of municipal officers left
the city hall at the head of the first
division an aeroplane appeared above
lower Broadway and hovered around
the great skyscrapers.
The paraders marched rapidly, more
than 10,000 passing a given point
within an hour.
With few exceptions, the marcher
carried small American flags. Most of
them also wore buttonhole emblems.
At frequent intervals came one of the
200 bands and musician were the only
persons in the civic divisions who wore
uniforms.
Plan to Form Woman's Party
Attacked by Illinois Suffrage Society
Chicago An attack on the plan to
form a woman's party was issued
Monday by the Illinois Equal Suffrage
association, while officials of the Con
gressional Union, promoters of the
idea, were opening registration head
quarters at 73 East Washintgon street
At the same time a campaign was
launched by the Union with posters,
banners and various advertising de
vices to boom the woman's party con
vention, which will be held June 5, 6
and 7 at the Blackstone theater during
the time the Republican convention is
in progress at the Coliseum. Twevle
woman speakers will begin holding
brief meetings at once under the au
spices of the Congressional Union, on
street corners, in factories or shops,
offices, college dormitories and at la
bor union gatherings.
'Confusion and duplication of
work" will be the effect of the Con
gressional Union's activities in Chi
cago, it is declared in the statement
issued by the Illinois Equal Suffrage
association. The proposal to form a
party "on sex lines" is also assailed,
and the union is defined as "a detached
group of Eastern suffragists."
Panama Police to Disarm.
Panama William K. Price, the
American minister, Monday delivered
to the Panama government the final de
mand for the surrender of 1200 rifle
used by the Panama National Police.
The disarmament of the police force
has been sought on account of riot
which resulted in the deaths of Amer
icans. It is understood the adminis
tration is opposed to the surrender of
the rifles, but delivered up the arms
under protest
