That Tend to Relieve
Danger at Border
Marathon, Tex., May 17.-A truck
driver arriving here today from
Boquillas skid that It was reported
on the border that Maj. Lang
horne and two troops of cavalry
had surrounded the Big Bend
bandit raiders about 125 miles
from the border, killing six and
capturing seventy-five. Army of
ficers here have made no an
nouncement regarding such an en­
gagement.
According to the truck driver's
report, the bandits were surround­
ed and did not put up a fight. The
Americans ceased firing at once.
The seventy-five captured, It was
said, were to be brought here for
trial.
Washington, D. C., May 17.—Gen
uine relief over the Mexican situation
was evident in administration circles
today. The principal cause was the
assurance conveyed to President Wil
son and his cabinet yesterday through
Secretary Baker ttrnt^the Carranza
government now is convinced the
United States has no intention of:In
tervening in Mexican politics and that
consequently resentment against the
punitive expedition is rapidly decreas
ing.
Gen. Scott, chief of staff of the army,
brought this word to Secretary Baker
from his conference at El Paso wi^h
Gen. Obregon, war minister for the
Carranza government.
Among the promises made by Gen.
Obregon with the aproval of Gen. Car
ranza at the conclusion of the confer
ence were these
Ten thousand selected Mexican
troops were to patrol the territory
about Parral, the southermost locality
from which American troops are being
withdrawn, and to search diligently'
for Villa or his bandits a strong Mex
ican force was to try to capture the
Glenn Springs and Boquillas raiders in
the Big Bend district and to liberate
Deemer, the American storekeeper,
carried off by the bandits no Mexican
tfoops were to be moved from Sonora
state through Pulpit pass to the rear
of Gen. Pershing's column.
Gen. Scott's part of the informal
pact did not Include any promises of
American troop withdrawal at a defi
nite time.
Gen. Scott expressed the opinion
that Gen. Carranza and his war min
ister have ordered speedy troop move
ments in ap attempt to carry out their
pledges.
CAPTIVES LIBERATED.
San Antonio, Tex., May 17.—The
rescue by the American soldiers of J.
Deemer and the colored cook, Monroe
Payne, carried off as prisoners by the
bandits that raided Glenn Springs and
Boquillas, was reported to Gen Fun
ston today.
Their rescue alive was due to the re
fusal of the residents of the village
where they had been left to carry out
the orders of the bandits to kill them
If the American troops attempted
their rescue.
The report came from Col. Frederick
Sibley, who received his information
from Maj. Langhorne, now about 100
miles south of the border. A detach
ment of Maj. Langhorne's force found
the Americans at El Pino, ninety miles
south of Boquillas, early yesterday
morning. The Americans had been
left there by their captors in charge
of the residents. None but the un
armed of the town was there when the
American soldiers arrived and no re
sistance was made.
Maj. Langhorne reported to Col.
Silbley that he was purshinp forward
and hoped to overtake the bandits dur
ing the day. He added that no fed
eral troops had been encountered and
that the attitude of the residents in
the territory through which he had
passed appeared friendly.

NEW RESPECT FOR
1L AMERICANS
FIGHTING- ABILITIES OF SOLD-
IERS BRING ABOUT CHANGE
OF OPINION.
Namlquipa, Chihuahua, May 17.—
Via wireless to Cplumbus, N. M.—
American residents of this section of
Mexico have assured Gen. J. J. Persh
ing, commander of the punitive ex
pedition, that the American troops
have restored respect on the part of
the natives for U. S. soldiers to a de
gree not existing for five years.
For some time Mexicans had sneer
ed at the fighting ability of the Ameri
cans, some of them honestly believing
that the United States soldiers were
afraid to engage any Mexican com
mand. After the Ojo Azules fight,
however, signs of the growing respect
on the part of the natives became
more and more manifest. American
noncombatants living in the vicinity
were treated with a courtesy which
astonished them and the like of which
they had not experienced for years.
These same Americans, however,
have openly expressed their lntefttion
of leaving Mexico if the expeditionary
command is withdrawn. They believe
that a native uprising will result im
mediately after the protection of the
American guns Is removed. Numerous
threats on the part of 'Villa and lieu
tenants to punish persons dealing with
the Americans also have caused some
Mexicans and Chinese merchants to
announce that they, too, will follow
the American command from Mexico
should It be with drawn.
80ME FIGHT, SAYS INDIAN.
Field headquarters, May 8.—By mo
tor train to Columbus, N. M.,„May 17.
—The high mortality of Mexican ban
dits in the Ojo Azules fight last Fri
day when Maj. Robert L. Howze's
command killed fifty-five Villistas,
was credited by officers here today in
part to the effectiveness of the new
army automatic .45 caliber pistol.
Most of the fighting was done with
pistola. ,,hy. the iwmitame whn .ran
down the bandits at close range.
The briefest report ol! the fight was
that brought back to the advanced
base by Sergeant Chicken, the oldest
of the twenty Apache Indian scouts.
No one with this expedition seems to
know Sergeant Chicken's age which
is estimated variously at from 70 to 90.
He was in the van during the pistol
battle, where his experiences were
said to be thrilling enough to fill a
book. When urged to tell what he
knew, Sergeant Chicken said:
"Him damn fine fight."
Further details he refused to dis
close.
SEARCHING TOWN
TO LOCATE BOOZE
Columbus, Ga., May 17.—A special
train of deputies arrived here today
under instructions from the attorney
general of Alabama to confiscate any
liquor found in Giard, Ala., just over
the line. This morning they entered
Girard from two sides, armed with
search warrants, and began their
work. It has been reported that large
quantities of liquor were stored In
Girard when Alabama went dry.
EIGHT MEN LOST
OFF U. S. CRUISER
Boston, May 17.—The U. S. cruiser
San Francisco, now serving as a mine
laying ship, was aground on a shoal
In Nantucket sound for several hours
early today in a gale, during which
it was reported she lost a whaleboat
containing eight members of her crew.
The fate of the men has not yet been
learned. The San Francisco floated
later without assistance and was not
greatly damaged. Observation from
the cruiser was impossible because of
the rain.
Messages saying eight men were
lost were received at two stations but
officers of the Charlestown navy yard,"
which was in touch with the cruiser
most of the time she was aground,
said they had no word that any men
were missing.
The exact place where the San
Francisco stranded is in doubt. Com
mander Belknap gave her position as
latitude 41.22 north, longitude 69.46.
This would place the cruiser off the
Old South shoal. Another message
from the cruiser said she had ground
ed on Great Round shoal, at the en
trance of Nantucket sound.

STATE CONVENE

Candidates Present
PRIMARY LAW IS
REGARDED AS JOKE
Sentiment Favorable to the
Repeal of Statute Very
Apparent at Meet
Cedar Rapids, May 17.—Candidates
for governor, Jess Willard, heavy
weight champion, and a herd of ele
phants today figured in the prelimin
aries to the first state republican con
vention, held here for the purpose of
ratifying the choice of delegates to tli£t
national republican convention, made
at the presidential preference primar
ies April 10.
A crowd estimated at 6,000 came to
Cedar Rapids today, some of them to
attend the convention, but most of
them, even political leaders admitted,
were more Interested in the circus,
which arrived simultaneously with the
delegates.
At preconventlon meetings and can
causes last night, enthusiasm for the
candidacy of Albert B. Cummins for
the presidency of the United State*
was most marked. It was said that
little choice has been observed in the
matter of gubernatorial candidate*
and that probably nothing which might
be taken as an endorsement for any
of the candidates will be done by the
convention.
No Contests Waged.
No contests developed In the district
caucuses which were concluded Just
prior to the opening of the convention.
The work of organization of the con
vention was completed within a few
minutes and Temporary Chairman
Clark was given a great ovation when
he arose to deliver his keynote speech.
The convention late this afternoon
is expected to go_.QELJtecord as. favor»
lflJT S^^en#*pr«tecuve tariff plank in
the national party platform. The en
dorsement of Senator Cummins' can
didacy was considered certain. Lead
ers planned also to introduce a resolu
tion, endorsing the stand taken by
Iowa representatives in congress on
preparedness legislation.
Prohibition questions were tabooed
at district and headquarters confer
ences today. The liquor question, it
was said, would not be brought up for
official consideration by the delegates.
Political "dopesters" professed to
see in the attitude of delegates a near
ly unanimous sentiment for the repeal
of the law providing for a presidential
preference primary.
Talk Big Issues.
National Issues, including prepared
ness and the protective tariff and in
terest in the anteprimary campaigns
of the various gubernatorial candi
dates, overshadowed other considera
tions. The delegates followed closely
the precedent set by the democrats at
Clinton recently when state issues
were to a large extent ignored in the
intense interest displayed in planks
which are expected to make the
structure of the national platform.
While a general tone of* optimism
marked the attitude of the majority of
the delegates, especially following the
delivery of the keynote speech by How
ard J. Clark of Des Moines, there was
a marked absence of the old time en
thusiasm which marked conventions in
the old days of republican dominion.
The contest for governor was of
great unofficial interest. Each of the
republican aspirants maintained head
quarters here and each prof eased' con
fidence in the outcome of the primary
as far as his candidacy was concerned.
It was only at these headquarters that
state issues were under discussion and
even there a marked reluctance in the
matter of prohibition, suffrage and
good roads-the predominant Qu*s-8ay
tlons of the campaign—was noted.
Reports of convention committees
took up most of the afternoon session
and a number of extemporaneous
speeches by delegates were scheduled.
Following are some of the important
committee appointments, listed by dis
tricts
First district—Chairman Arthur
Springer, Wapello resolutions com

French curtain of fire.
On the Russian front, an attack by
the Germans in the large region be
tween Dvinsk and Vilna resulted in
temporary gains, but the Russians, by
a counter attack, drove the Germans
back to their former positions. A vig
orous attack was also launched by the
Germans In the lower Stripa region of
Galicia but the Russians repulsed
them.
Austrian air raiders attempted to at
tack a train on which were Queen Hel

royal household. The attack failed and
the air raiders were put to flight by

WILSON SUGGESTS
COOPERATION FOR
AIDING BUSINESS
WOULD HUNT OUT "UNHEALTHY"
INDUSTRIES AND HELP FIND
THE CURE.
Washington, D. C., May 17.—Coop
eration between the' federal trade
commission and business firms and
commercial organizations with the ob
ject of standardizing trade is recom
mended by President Wilson in a let
ter to Edward N. Hurley, vice chair
man of the commission, made public
today at the white house. The presi
dent urgeB that the commission in
vestigate industries, and, if it finds
any not "healthy," it suggest "a prac
tical and helpful remedy."
The president wrote to Mr. Hurley
to commend him for suggestions made
In a recent speech at Boston in which
Mr. Hurley told of efforts being made
by the commission to assist the small
manufacturer and merchant in better
ing his condition by helping him im
prove his cost accounting and book
keeping methods.
Should Know Costs.
"This Is a step in the right direc
tion and one of the main fundamen
tals of any successful business," said
the president. "It is most Important
to the future success of a business
man that he should know what his,
goods actually cost to manufacture
and to sell. If he has these facts, they
will enable him to present a modern
balance sheet to his bank and as a
result he will be better able to obtain
credit with which to expand and de
velop his business.
"Your suggestion that trade assocl*
ations, associations of retail and
wholesale merchants, commercial
clubs, boards* of trade, manufacturers'
associations, credit associations and
other similar organizations should be
encouraged in every feasible way by
the government, seems to me a very
wise one. To furnish them with data
and comprehensive Information In or
jder that they more easily accomplish

business progress of the country.

"Too much emphasis can not be
placed on your suggestion that materl-

Must Be Thorough.
"If we are to be an important factor
In a world's market, we must be more

The encouragement of trade associa
tions and standardization and the in
stalling of better cost accounting
methods In our business concerns will
go a long way toward accomplishing
this end.
"It is my hope that, in addition to
the other work which the federal trade
commission is doing, It will ascertain
the facts regarding conditions in our
various industries. If it finds that an
industry is not healthy, it should,
after carefully considering the facts,
in cooperation with the parties inter
ested, suggest a practical and helpful
remedy. In this way many of our dif

U. 3. TRADE EXPANDING.
New York, May 17.—Despairing ol
obtaining adequate tonnage to ship
their exports and to bring to them in
return needed manufactured articles
from the United States, numerous big
shippers of Central and South Ameri
ca now are! buying in this country
machinery with which they may turn
their raw products into manufactured
articles for their own trade, accord
ing to .Robert Lee Dunn, secretary of
the All-America asociation, a Pan
American trade organization with
headquarters here.
"We are finding more than ever,"
said' Mr. Dunn, "that the people of
Central America want to do their for
eign business here and we also find
they are learning that It pays to elim
inate the middle man from their
transactions and deal direct with the
producer. They are also willing to
trade on a cash basis. Through this
organization we have handled since
January 1 almost $500,000 in gold
coin, deposited here to draw against
