the Sociability tour pathfinders
wheeled into Jamestown after 6
o'clock this evening, finishing an ar­
duous day's run from Fargo. Natu­
rally, the heavy rains of the past few
days have made some bad going
through the Red River valley, and al­
though the pathfinders Had the bene­
fit of a local pilot's knowledge of the
road, they could not escape a number
of poor spots, all of which will imme­
diately receive such attention as will
place tliem beyond the possibility of
further annoying Red Trail tourists.

the roads generally from Dawson to
the iBurleigh county hub are dry, ra­
ther sandy, and usually in excellent
condition. There is only one really
bad spot between McKenzie and Bis­
marck, and Mr. Watson, who knows
every inch of the country, will show
the automobilists how to avoid that
pitfall.
Reception Tonight.
If no accidents occur, the pathfind­
ers should reach Bismarck by mid

enthusiasts have planned an informal
reception and luncheon in their honor
for this .evening. The McKenzie will
be the scene of the festivities, an or­
chestra will be engaged, and every­
one who is interested in automobiling,
in good roads, in the Red Trail and
in next summer's Sociability tour is
invited to participate.
The newspaper men in the party no
doubt will have something to say of
Bismarck in their letters home, ayB
the capital city will endeavor to leave
a good impression in the minds of
the pathfinders.
Northern Pacific Co-operates.
The Northern Pacific Railway com­
pany is extending every possible cour­
tesy to the. pathfinders. J. L. Peil,
advertising manager for the company,
has advised agents all along the line
of their coming and has requested
them to evidence the good will c$
the company toy extending them hos­
pitality, offering information as to
road conditions and in other ways to
co-operate in the company's effort to
make the pathfinding trip as pleasant
as possible.
Continue Journey Tomorrow.
The pathfinders probably will
leave Bismarck at 9:00 tomorrow
morning, ferrying across the river
and heading west fo Dickinson,
-where they will ^pend the night.
The roads west of the river are in
fairly good condition, and the path­
finders' greatest difficulties will have
been left behind them when they
reach Bismarck.

MAN DROPS DEAO
WHILE HE IS WORKING
Hazelton, X. D., May 17.—L. H. Sis
co, one of the county's old and re­
spected citizens living a few miles
north of Kintyre, dropped dead while
working in the yard at his home.
Mr. Sisco apparently had been in
the best' of health up to within a few
moments of liis death. Hte was at
work tuni the yard, and nupii looking
out his daughter noticed him lying
upon this ground and apparently strug­
gling to get up. She immediately
ran t'o his assistance, but he expired
before she reached him.
Mr. Sisco has been in the county
ever since the early nineties and was
one of the most progressive and re­
spected citizens.
Republbican Candidate for Sec*

J. L. Hjort, republican candidate
for secretary of state, arrived in Bis­
marck last evening, enroute to south­
eastern points. He has 'begun a vig­
orous campaign and reports received
from all portions of the state indi
cate that Mr. Hjort is gaining ground
fast and stands an excellent show
of landing the nomination.
The fact that he is making his cam­
paign as a republican has gained him
thousands of friends throughout the
state. When in the legislature, Mr.
Hjort was one of the" most popular
members. He has been receiving in­
vitations from all parts of the state
for. addresses. Bad roads prevented
him from making the great celebra­
tion at iEnderlin yesterday, where he
was billed to appear at the 17th cf
May festivities.
On May 30, he will be a guest of
honor at Washburn, at the Memorial
Day celebration.
Members of the state press are do­
ing much to assist iMr. Hjort in his
campaign. From other sources be
has received promises of valuable
support. There seems to be a general
feeling over the state that th/er.e"

BLEXRUD FOR
Petitions Are Being Circulated
by Their Friends in This
County.
COL. C. B. LITTLE TO
RUN FOR THE SENATE
Important That Burleigh Have a
Strong Delegation at Next
Session.
Petitions were circulated yesterday
for C. L. Young, John Homan of Bis­
marck, and A. M. Blexrud, Regan, who
are being urged to run for the Re­
publican nomination for the legisla­
ture. Col C. B. Little's petitions for
state senator have been filled and will
be filed soon.
These men can be depended upon
to work for the best interests of Bis­
marck. There are many important
questions affecting this county to
come before the next session and it
is important that the city and county
be well represented.
It was only after the earnest solici­
tation of their friends that these men
consented to run. C. L. Young is one
of the city's leading attorneys. He
served for several years as assistant
attorney general. Mr. Young probably
has au wide an acquaintance among
the legislators as anyone in the city.
His service in the attorney general's
office gave him considerable experi­
ence in law making which will be of
value to Burleigh county.
Mr. Blexrud is a well known farm­
er and will represent their interests.
He is identified with the various farm­
ers' movements and has made a.study
of marketing problems and other leg­
islation of interest to the farmers.
The farmers of this county will find
their interests well protected by Mr.
Blexrud.
John Homan has represented Bur­
leigh county at two former sessions
of the legislature. He is popular with
the legislators and will be.a valuable
member of the delegation^. Mr. Ho
t(i£u in all "liis votes worl
"fiest interests of the county. He is
alive to the needs of this section of
the state.
Col. Little's service in the legisla­
ture is too well known to need addi­
tional comment. With the exception
of two terms, he has served in the
senate since statehood. It was only
upon the insistence of his friends that
Col. Little consented to make the run.

tion Conference.
Lake Mohonk, N. Y.v May 17.—Wil­
liam Howard Taft'. appeared before
the Lake Mohonk conference on In­
ternational Arbitration tonight as a
missionary of the League to Ejrforce
Peace. In taking his place as pre­
siding officer here, Mr. Taft answered
the pacifists who objected to the new
League because it presupposes the
use of force. He replied' also to crit­
ics of the Leagute.'wlio tielifeve it would
draw the United States into "entang­
ling alliances."
"I do not think we have reached a
time," said Mr. Taft, "when force as
an aid to a moral impulse can be dis­
pensed with. We need a police force
at home, and the same need exists
in the relations between nations.
"As regards the fear of entangling
alliances, our situation now is very
different from what it was when
Washington gave his warning."
Draws Contrasts.
Ha enumerated the developments
which have brought the United States
into inevitable contrast with foreign
powere. Speaking of the Philippines,
he declared: "I cannot tell you what
I think of our present Philippine pol­
icy in the presence of ladies." Mex­
ico, he characterized as an "interna­
tional nuisance likely to entail great­
er burdens upon us."
The opportunity to carry out the
proposals of the League to Enforce
Peace Mr. Taft said is growing more
and more probabie.

London, May 17.—Until Premier
Asquith's return tto -(London at the
end of the week, nothing definite is
likely to «be done as the result of his
visit in Ireland. He is still consol­
ing with various authorities and is
expected to visit Cork tomorrow,
where he will become acquainted
with the nationalists' view. In the
meantime no steps toward filling the
vacancies in the Irish administration
are being taken and it is supposed
that the main reason for the premi­
er's being sworn in as a member of
the Irish privy council is that he may
become the minister in parliament
for Irish affairs temporarily.
The nationalist members attach
the greatest significance to this step,
because it will give the premier jin
actual voice in shaping the admin­
istration of Ireland.
The London papers teem with sug­
gestions of a possible settlement ol
the Irish problem.' They favor for
the most part the idea of supplant­
ing the executive government in
south and west Ireland. They point
out that should experience show suc­
cessful results in the western and
southern part of Ireland under the
Dublin parliament., Ulster might be
inclined to come in under that parlia­
ment.

Premier Asquith has reached the

Columbus, Ga., .May 17.—The state
militia tonight took charge of the sit­
uation in Gerard, Ala., just across the
line from here, where a great force

many thousands of dollars worth of
liquor, held in violation of the Ala­

ly a half-million dollars worth of li­
quor had been found.
Great crowds filled ^he streets of
Gerard, a town of .5,000 .people, this
afternoon and tonight. The crowds
interfered somewhat with the work
of the raiders, though there was no
serious disorder.
Mayor Morgan appointed a large
number of special police to aid the
militiamen, and instructed them to
protect the property of Gerard's citi­
zens. The special deputies were in­
structed to arrest anyone interfering
with them. Three hundred barrels
of whisky were found in Lower Ger­
ard. In some farmhouses, liquor es­
timated to be worth ISO,000 was seiz­
ed.

STOREKEEPER AND COOK
RESCUED FROM BANDITS
San Francisco, May 17.—An early
withdrawal of the punitive expedition,
directly by Col. Sibley, south of 'Bo
quilles, was indicated at department
headquarters today. The rescue of
Jesse Demeer, the storekeeper, and
Monroe Payne, the negro cook, who
were carried across the border by
bandits when they raided Glenn
Sprigs and Boquilles, 12 days ago,
was reported today by Col. Sibley,
who received this information from
IMajor Langhorne. He reported that
he was endeavoring to overtake the
bandits who had eluded him at iEl
Pino, from where he sent the report
and where he found Demeer and
Payne.
Officers here regarded it as prob­
able that a successful encounter with
the bandits would bring the expedi­
tion to an end and not at all improb­
able that failure to overtake them
would also be followed by a recall.
Left at Village.
Demeer and Payne had been left at
El Pino- by the retreating 'bandits,
with Instructions to the residents
that they be killed if an attempt to
rescue was made. The residents of
the village refused to obey the in­
structions, professing their friendli­
ness to the Americans when they en­
tered the town yesterday morning.

troops of cavalry had surrounded the
Big Bend raiders, about 125 miles
from the oorder, killing six and cap­
turing 73.
According to the truck driver's re­
port, the bandits were surrounded,
and did not put up a fight. The Am­
ericans ceased firing at once.
The 75 captured, it was said, were
to be brought here for trial.

Coahuila, General Trevino said to­
day:
"I am going to Chihuahua with 10,

men on the border now, a total of
17,000 troops. They will be distri­
buted at all important points, both
inland and on the frontier, to pre­
vent further raids into the States,
and to finish up Villistats bandits
quickly.
"I am arranging special motor

cost in the European war.
"The waste of this war will make
human life too valuable to be neg­
lected like it has been," he declared.
"It has been my belief that our pres­
ent unnecessary poverty is nothing
less than a reproach to religion, and
thanks in part to the religious toler­
ance which this conference illustrates
and the social knowledge which titt
conference inspires and advocates
the level of life will rise."
