Impressive Ceremony Comes
At Close of Magnificent
Street Parade.
Baton Rouge, La., Ma. I,.
At 12:17 o'clock, in the presence
of his wife, her aged mother,
Mrs. S. P. Ector of Shrevep)ort,
with Gov. L. E. Hall and Judge
T. Sambola :t.Jones, standing by
his side, and with Mayor Behr
man, National Democratic Com
mitteeman Robert Ewing, .lus
tices of the Supreme Court, all
State officials, both retiring and
incoming members of the House
and State and 8000 wildly en
thusiastic citizeas of Louisiana
grouped about him, and with
booming of 17 cannons, Ruffin
G. Pleasant became Governor of
Louisiana, the oath of office be
ing administered by Chief Jus
tice Frank A. Monroe.
At 12:19 Gov. Pleasant began
delivering his inaugural address,
standing under a beautiful arch
of ferns and fresh flowers, with
the folds of the Pelican flag fall
ing above his head.
Mrs. Luther E. Hall sat be
side Mrs. Pleasant during the
ceremony. John Pleasant, un
cle, and John Hamilton, business
partner of Col. Pleasant's father
came from F rmersville to wit
ness the inauguration of the
Union parish boy to the highest
office within the gift of the peo
ple of his native state.
As he concluded his address,
Mrs. Pleasant, now first lady of
the State, slipped through tho
g,,4of relatives and friends
seated about her, and was among
the first to reach the side of her
distinguished husband. Taking
her in his arms he kissed her af
fectionately as the great crowd
applauded approvingly.
The administering of the oath
of office by Chief Justice Mon
roe, who came here for that par
ticular purpose was an impres
sive ceremony.
Threatening skies had cleared
and the weather was .ideal, al
though still hot. At the sug
gestion of the committee in
charge, Baton Rougeans were
robed in white and thousands of
others, both men and women,
wore this color.
It was a most beautiful parade
that wended its way from Uni
versity Place, through Third
street into the Boulevard and to
has probably lvnevr xvitnoss-1 

trition pr,3mptly on the stroke
of 12. Probably few, if any,
governors of Luisiana have
been inaugurated under so many
favo.rale auspices as Rutin G.
Pleasant. Nominated in th e
Democratic primary Jan. 25, by
an overwhelming majority of
more than 50000, carrying every
parish of the State save one, and
again in the general election of
April 18, elected over his Pro
gressive adversary, 'John M.
Parker, by almost 33000, Colonel
Pleasant today truly became the
governor of all the people-the
choice of both city and country,

I)eparts.
A special train left New Or
leans Monday morning to Birm
ingham carrying perhaps the
largest local delegation of Con
federate veterans, families and
friends in many years, to attend
a Confederate reunion.
The train was in charge of
General A. B. Booth, while Miss
Gladys Kernan, sponsor, for the
South, was a passenger.

J W Thomas, lot 6 in Hackle.,
Senator D. R. Jhnson Pro
poses Co-Operative Plan w
To Replace Fh'e and Tor
nado Policies. o
Baton Rouge, May 10.--Sena
tor Delos I. Johns in, of Frank -
si
linton, has a bill to save the pub.
licscho,l, 25,'00 annually in
fire and tornalo incurtrance poli.
cies by creating : funlllld on a co-'S
operative basis.
"The bill in course of prepara
tion which I will inltroduce early sI
next week, if enact.e, int,) I w, "
will save the schools of this state
not lVs than 825,100 per annum c
and I believe it will be even more p
than that," said Mr. Johnson. n
'"lhep1rts from forty parishes in 0
which state in-t;iutions are loca- tl
ted, shllw thi.i within a period of
five years past, 875,000 has been ti
paid out in insurance premiums tl
by the school boards of these b
parishes and during that time
only S1,000 fire loss ., have- been
replace, or paid in by the insu- ti
ranee c lmpanies. Reports frow c
the state institutions and the t
other 23 parishes hav' not yet
been received which will more
than double the amount paid out I
in thle entire state by the scIo',ls v
for insurance, and doubtless will I
correspondingly increase the
receipts for fire loss.
"In other words, we estimate
from the reports already received t
that $150.000 has been paid out
in premiums within the past five
years and not more than $16,000
or 820,000 have been returned in
fire 'osses.
"We propose in the measure
that all school property in the
state shall be insured on a mutual
or co-operative basis by which all
losses by fire or storms shall be
replaced in the sum or value pre
viously fixed by assessing or de
ducting from the funds to be re
mitted by the state to each parish
or school entity an amount in
proportion to the insurance car
ried or agreed upon for each par
ish or school entity sufficient to
replace the loss."
Mt. Ilermin School Closes.
Friday, May 12th the patrons
and friends of the Mlt. Hermon
school gathered in the beautiful
oak grove adjoining the school
building for a happy day of re
joicing over a successful yea:ir's
work in their new consolidated
school.
A program of music and speak
ing interspersed with refresh
ments and a picnic dinner was the
) order of the day. Prof. Bonds,
- principal of the school was chair
t man of the occnsion and intro
Sduced the speakers, State Supt.
r T. H. Harris, of Baton Rouge,
making the principal address of
:the morning, followed by Parish
1 Supt. D. H. Stringfield in a few
U remarks. An intermission of
2 two hours for dinner was then
I called and after reassembling
5 Judge J. B. Lancaster and Ex
' Gov. Sanders made splendid
0 addresses. The crowd than re
Spaired to the ball ground where
the local team went up against
the Franklinton nine in a very
f interesting game which resulted
- in favor of the Franklinton team.
10 A concert that night giveu by
Sepresentatives from(, all the
Sgrades of thle .,liool, with the
Ott Or'hestra, proved specially
Sentertaining and was greatly en
Mjoyed by the crowd.
i Four teachers in the literary
e department with a music teacher

! term and a splendid year's work
Swas accomplished, very much to
the credit of the ec.operative pa.
trans for which thls neighbor. I
ho-d ,specially has always been

the trustees who hope to accomp.
lish greater things yet for the
second term in their consolidated
school.
