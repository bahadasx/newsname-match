u Ma>' 18?Germany.!
through Count von Uernstorff, has in-'
tt a" Ger;aan consuls in thoi
United States to admonish German cit
izens in yielr districts to scrupulously!
observe American laws. This was;
done in an effort to end various alleged
S!?llons of An,erlcan neutrality.
The ambassador acted on instruc-!
Hons from the Berlin foreign office.
The action was announced today in
this official statement from the German
embassy:
"In consequence of cases which have
occurred of late the German ambassa
dor has sent instructions to all Ger
man consuls in the United States to
strongly impress upon German citizens
living In their districts that it Is their
duty to scrupulously obey the laws of
the stato in which they reside."
It was said at the German embassy
that the insrtuctlona were designed to
prevent plots or lawlessness on the
part of German citizens who might
be disposed to engage In such.
The German government, it was said,
looks with great disfavor upon any
such conduct and desires that they
shall not engage In any undertaking
in any way outside the law.
It was not disclosed whfether spe
cific cases had been brought to the at
tention of (he German government, but
it was made clear that Berlin officials
want (ho United States and its people
to understand that they have not
countenanred any Illegal affairs with
which German citiens or sympathizers
in this country hove been connected.
Count von Bernstrolt's instructions
vore received Inst night and were for
warded to German consuls immediate
ly.
Administration officials were much
interested In the statement issued by
Count von Bernstorff and expressed
themselves as much pleaseiL
It was Bald the Instructions to Ger
man consuls were not the result of any
action of the United States. Officials
thought the step might do much to re
lieve troublesome conditions which
have manifested themselves almost
since the beginning of the war.
!i Is understood the Berlin foreign
office learned that public opinion In
this country was being affected bv
activities of sympathizers concerned in
passport frauds, bomb plots and sim
ilar operations.
