War Does Not Quicken
but Retards
the Progress of the
Human Race
By VISCOUNT BRYCE. English
Statesman
MATERIALLY war is destruction—the destruction of life the de
struction of property, the diversion of workers from useful labor,
the interruption of'trade, the shock given to international conh
dence. Against this waste and this impoverishment ot peoples n vic
torious state may set off what it wins in territory or tribute, but these
forcibly got gains do not always prosper. On the nrtgU lide, 1 llJ ; K 'f
FORK WAR, SO FAB AS THE WOKL ) GEN HAL A IS CON
CERNED, CLEARLY RETARDS PROGRESS BY THE EX UNC
TION OF A PART OF THE WORLD'S CAPITAL.
On the intellectual side its consequence is to direct men s minus
specially to military and naval questions and to make them occupy them
selves with things material rattier than with things intellectual or spir
itual and to create and exalt a professional class which, whether or no It
is well educated, is comparatively insensible to Intellectual and artistic
influences and pleasures. . ,
On a review of the whole matter war will not he found to have quick
ened but to have greatly retarded the upward march of man. \\ hat,
then, InW been the causes to which progress has been due? tartly, no
doubt, to competition, but chiefly to thought. Thought ts not helped by
war It is the races thut know how to think rather than the far more
numerous noes that know only how to light that have led the world
Thinking has produced literature and art Now, _ the■ thought of a
people is most active when it is brought into contact with the thought of
another, because Bach loses its variety and freedom of play when it has
worked too long upon accustomed lines. Isolation retards progress, in
tercourse quickens it. Such contact with the process of learning wh.eh
follows therefrom may happen by war.
BUT IT HAPPENS FAR OFTENER IN PEACE, AND IT 18 IN PEACE
