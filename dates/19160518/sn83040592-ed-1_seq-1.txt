Time To Act.
It la time for Baxter Springs
people to get together and act as
a unit for the upbuilding of the
town. Tbe strikes made on the
lands adjoining this town on tbe
west, and from there on to Picher
show one continuous ore body.
Tbe ore finds mean that Baa
ter Springs can grow if her peo
ple desire ber to grow. There is
no reason in tbe world why Bax
ter Springs should not increase
in population more than a thous
and in the next twelve months.
There is one way for this condi
tion to be brought about.
Let a big rousing meeting be
held. ' Get hold of some fellow
for a talker who ean enthuse the
hold backs. Let the meeting be
for tbe express purpose of finding
out who can and will build torn
houses. Let the fellows sign lit
tie pledge eards, or a gentleman's
agreement that they will build at
least some to'tbf a bouse for new
people to live in. Tbe town can't
grow another bit without more
bouses. .
Two, three and four room
houses will pay a return on the
investment of from 25 to 35 per
cent. What, in tbe name of hea
ven, do yon want better than
that?
Do -you want your town to
grow-rto get to the front to be
placed on the bustling map of the
universe? Then get busy and
talk to your neighbor. Agree
with him to build a bouse, and
after you have bim cinched, make
tbe same sort of agreement with
some other fellow. Make tne
agreement with as many fellows
as you can get to listen to you.
It won't be necessary to talk
much. Just impress on him the
need and the big return on the
investment and he will join you.
And after this sort of thing is
started it will be mighty bard to
stop it But whom the world
wants to stop it?

Good Men
We submit this declarative statement: "The success
of any organization depends upon its members; not on its
form."
This is especially true in the organization of a bank.
No matter what form the bank may adopt, no'matter how
elaborate the fixtures of the building, no matter how big
the capital stock, the success of the institution depends
upon the men who are interested in it and guard its funds
and direct its policies. We are particularly proud of the
officers, directors and stockholders who are interested in our
bank. They are among the best men in the community
and help to make our bank a strong one.
