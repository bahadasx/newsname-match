| DEATH FROM HYDROPHOBIA.
Second! Fatality Within Week in Laurens
County.
Laurens, May 14.?The second
death from hydrophobia to occur in
Laurens within the week is reported
from the vicinity of Cold Point,
where a three-year-old negro child
has died of rabies. The child was
bitten about four weeks ago, and it
was under treatment for more than
three weeks by local physicians. As
in the case of the little Strickland
lad, who died Tuesday, this second
victim was frightfully bitten about
thft facft and hands. At the same
time the child was attacked the
father, in attempting to beat off the
dog, was badly bitten on the hands.
As a result of these fatalities, Laurens
county is going to have several
hundreds dogs less than in many a
day. In fact, the slaughter has been
going on for three or four weeks,
and it will continue for some time
or at least until the loafing class is
dispatched.
oats that were cut during the past

for the rain to hold off a day or two

All cotton that is up is looking
fine; is clean and nearly all chopped
to a stand. Corn is too young to
suffer as yet and is also looking fine,
but there is lots of cotton planted,
and not up for lack of moisture. Unless
we get more rain, there will not
be much of a change, as the little
that has fallen so far will soon have
vanished.

A Letter From "Occasional."
Olar, May 15.?We are told that
"it is an ill wind that blows nobody
any good;" so, although it is dry
and dusty, it is a nice time to gather
grain. *
As your old* time correspondent,
"Old Timer," has been out west to
"view the land scape o'er," we hope
he will write it up. W? are too busy
to go to see him, and we want to
hear something that is not any kin to
war news.
The fishermen keep themselves
busy, and if we were to write what
we know about some of their catches,
some people would think it was a
"fish story," so we abstain from it.
Since writing the above Mr. J. 0.
Ritter dropped in on me and said, "I
went a fishing in the swamp yesterday
and caught 11 jack fish, with live
bait, from under one tree, and didn't
move my feet two feet from where
I caught the first fish. I then went
on down the banks, and came across
a moccasin on the bank with a big
cat fish in his mouth. I killed the
snake, and rolled the fish back in
the water, and it may not be stopped
running yet." I read the first part
of this letter to Mr. Ritter and told
him I was going to write what he
said, although I had not intended to
write on the fish subject at all.
Just then the sheriff from your
town with four deputies came along
and arrested me. They took me
down the river to a place where that
indefatiable piscatorial artist, Willie
Best, was surrounded, N., E., S. and
W., by fish, and now how can we
write on any other subject, when
even to the snakes go a-fishing?
Just a word in parenthesis now.
(Isn't it best to take something along
that is good for snake bites?) And
yet man is insatiable. Some of our
young men go away down the coun
try to a place called Nigger Lake,
where they catch even more than
they do up here. And now in the
quietude of the night, sitting here
alone, I feel that I voice the sentiments
of the crowd that was with me
today when I say, "No, I thank you,
not any more fish for me at present,"
and I drop the subject.
The crops at present remind me
of a little girl. They are too little
and young to introduce into society;
yet, perhaps, when they get older?
I mean the crops?I may say more
about them. And if they ever grow
any prettier?I mean the girls?I
will s^y something about them.
The most of our farmers have
good stands and the crops have a
long time to make yet; and I take an
optimistic view of the situation and
feel cheerful.
A gentleman being asked his age
replied: "If the years of my life

product divided by 2, the result
would be equal to 46." What was

SITUATION IN ERIN OMINOUS. j
Punishment of Rebels Caused Reaction
of Sympathy Among People.
Ivondon, May 11.?The most dangerous
factor in the Irish situation,
namely, that the punishment of the 1
rebels would cause a reaction of sympathy
atnong the warm-hearted and
emotional people appears to be fast
materializing.
John Dillon, one of the most respected
of the Nationalists, but often
one of the bitterest antagonists of
British rule, attacked the government
today in the house of commons
in a speech which, for bitter denunciation,
has not been surpassed at
Westminster since Parnell's days.
Premier Asquith has personally
stepped into the breach and is taking

and doubtless to give instructions
to Gen. Maxwell regarding the
policy which the military government
j must pursue, now that the chief civil
! administrators, Lord Wimborne, Au\
gustine Birrel and Sir Matthew Na|
than, have retired from office. The
premier left here tonight by the Irish
j Mail train on his way to that city.
Mr. Asquith once before took the

when the threatened Ulster revolt in

J that he was going to consult with the
authorities in order to arrive at some
arrangement satisfactory to Irishmen
of all parties, and no statesman ever
attempted a harder achievement. He
frankly declared that the present sit
uation could not continue. Many or
the newspapers, particularly the Liberal
organs, call upon the Irish factions
to seize the opportunity for set- !
tling their long standing differences.
The Marquis of Lansdowne intimated
to the house of lords that the
disarmament of all Ireland will be
undertaken. This would mean the
disarmament of the Ulster and Nationalist
Volunteers, and whether
that can be done depends on Sir Edward
Carson and John Redmond
more than on any other individual.
The house of commerce negatived,
without division, Mr. Dillon's motion
demanding that the government
should immediately declare its inten
tion. The house of lords adopted
without division Lord Lordburn's motion
expressing dissatisfaction with
the government's management of Ireland.
Text of Resolution.
The text of the resolution presented
by John Dillon is as follows:
"That in the interests of peace and 1
good government in Ireland, it is vi- 1
tally important that the government
should immediately make a full statement
of their intentions as to con- j
tinuance of executions in that country,
carried out as a result of secret
military trials, and as to the con- (
tinuance of martial law, military rule ]
and the searches and wholesale ar- ]
rests now going on in various dis- ,
tricts of the country."
Mr. Dillon's motion was voted
down without a division. !
In speaking on his resolution Mr J j
Dillon referred to the execution of <

Satisfactory Adjustment With Great

Washington, May 15.?Negotiations
with Great Britain regarding
interference with mails to and from

tuts uuittsu oiaces tinu nitcii uptiuu
of neutral commerce by the British
fleet are to be resumed in the very
near future. A note insisting sharply
upon modifications in the treatment
of mails already is being prepared
at the State department, and
as soon as possible work will be begun
on a reply to. the last British
note defending the operation of the
blockade orders in council.
Secretary Lansing let it be known
last week that the implied change in
the German note on submarine warfare
expressing confidence that the
United States would hold Great Britain
to compliance with international
law had made it difficult to proceed
with the British negotiations. He
said today, however, th?t these negotiations
would be continued
promptly in spite of the embarrassing
situation. The note now being prepared
reiterates the original protest
of the United States against the detention
and interference with American
mails. The reply of Great Britain,
received several weeks ago, is
considered unsatisfactory to President
Wilson. It is understood that
the newr demand will be more decid?

A phase of interference with mails,
which would be made the subject of
special protest, is the custom of taking
neutral ships into British ports
for inspection and then removing the
mails, and sometimes subjecting
them to long delays.
The refusal of Great Britain to allow
hospital supplies to be sent by
the American Red Cross to Germany
and her allies still is being carefully
investigated at the State department,
and a protest on this ubject is expected
to go forward in the near future.
DEATH FROM BURNS.
Mrs. Eliza SheaJy Loses Life in

Lexington, May 14.?Mrs. Eliza
Shealy, widow of the late John
Shealy, met a horrible death Tuesday
at her home about a mile south
of Summit, when her clothing caught

years of age, and Miss Katherine

Mrs. Shealy is survived by four
children?three daughters and one
son, as follows: Mrs. W. L. Rawl,

roving commission to caj-ry out
"these horrible executions."
Mr. Tennant announced today
there had been fourteen executions,
although the previous figure was
twelve. He asked what people were
to believe, and added that it was no
wonder many viewed the matter with
gravest concern lest another execution
had been held back from the
premier and might be brought to
light later.
Mr. Dillon said he drafted his resoI
lution in order to confine the discussion
to the narrow but important issue
of military executions, and the
continuance of martial law. He
complained that Premier Asquith
was kept in the dark by the military
authorities as to what was going on.
He did not hold Gen. Maxwell, the
British commander, and the other
military authorities responsible for
the execution of F. Sheehy Skeffington,
but pointed out that Mr. Skeffington
was shot on April 26 and the
military authorities, responsible for
it until May 6.
"How could any one blame the
people of Dublin for believing dozens
Df others have been shot secretly in
barracks?" he asked. "Horrible rumors
are current in Dublin and they
are embittering the people."

TIGERS IX GEORGIA.
Farm Wagons With False Rottoms
Club Counters With Rig Tops.
Atlanta,
May 14.?Activities of officers
to rigidly enforce Georgia's
prohibition law that went into effect
May 1 have disclosed some unique
methods of "blind tigers" to evade
the law. An inconspicuous farm wa
gon, driven on tne streets of Atlanta,
was equipped with a false bottom
filled with pint bottles of liquor, a
counter in a "social" club has a false
top full of bottles, and by following
a series of trap doors discovered un- " '. >
der a house in the outskirts of the
city officers found a large quantity of
liquor stored in a cave that had once
been used for illicit distilling. The
"blockaders" had used the chimney
of the house to carry off the smoke.
Getting rid of the smoke is one of
the blockaders' most perplexing
problem*
A general raid at 7:30 o'clock in
the morning at Savannah participated
in practically by every member of
the police force resulted in confiscation
of so much liquor that nearly
every dray in the city was employed
to haul it to the police station. More
than 100 arrests were made. No ^
private homes, where a family might
have provided against the anti-shipping
feature by laying in a little
more than the prescribed two quarts
of liquor, gallon of wine or fortyeight
pints of beer, were entered.
Atlanta officials have stated that they
would investigate homes where it
was believed more than the law allows
is stored, but no such action has
been taken. The fact that large
quantities of intoxicants were shipped
into the State just prior to May ^
1 has been established beyond doubt.
It has been admitted by officials
that in at least three important cities
of the State and in some commuuities
not so thickly populated, the former
prohibition law was not rigidly
enforced. That the law allowed the
sale of beer but not liquor.
Reports from every section of the
State, however, show that the new
law is being lived up to with the exception
of the comparatively few
"blind tigers." Persons for and
against prohibition point to the spectacular
and far-reaching Savannah
raid as evidence of this.
Liquor confiscated in the ffrst tnirteen
days of May has run into the
tens of thousands of gallons. The
sheriff of Coffee county seized a portion
of two carloads in the possession
of the Ocila, Pine Bloom and Valdos- /
ta railroad, and out of that act has
grown the first case attacking the
law. The railroad was transporting
the liquor during the latter part of
April and had it on a side track at
Ocila May 1. After part of the liquor
was seized Federal Judge EmeryV.
Speer granted a temporary injunction
restraining the officers from tak
ing the remainder. Men guarding
the cars were shot at the first night *
after the injunction was issued. A
few ineffectual shots were fired. No
one was hurt.
Another case in wThich interpreta
tion of the law is involved is in the
Atlanta courts. A railroad refused
to deliver to a soft drink manufacturing
company two barrels* of pure
alcohol, which is used in dissolving
certain ingredients which go into the
beverage. The company is suing in
the Fulton county superior court for
possession of the alcohol, delivery o^
which the railroad claims, would be
in violation of the prohibition law.
Fines for violation of the law already
have amounted to more than $3,000
<
in the local police court.
Orders to destroy liquor was carried
to the limit by an Atlanta polw?pmfl.n
Fridav A npsrro droDDed a
quart ^bottle of whiskey at the most
prominent corner in the city. The
officer lighted the puddle that the
spilled beverage made and burned it.
In his report to headquarters he said
two hundred persons were attracted.
to the scene.
Disastrous Fire at Whitmire.

Whitmire, May 12.?The worst fire'
in the history of Whitmire started

work of the squad in charge of -what
hose was available the fire was checked
