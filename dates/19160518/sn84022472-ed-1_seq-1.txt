THE WEATHER
-
Connecticut: partly cloudy tonight;
Friday fair, -continued, cool.' Moderate
west winds. v
cairn island where her father has
long ruled over the people -there
ed much of. interest today to the I
known facts about that Utopian Pa-
oific paradise that ,now pays tribute j
to the - British Crown.:
A synopsis of the government, reli-
gion, morals and customs as practised '
at Pitcairn, 'alone in the great ex-
panse of Pacific waters discloses "Uto-
pian features, far beyond the imagina-!
tion of a' Thomas Moore or even the !
Arcadian views as expressed by Long- j
fellow. "
In Pitcairn, as a result of 129 year3
of self-government, money has been :
discarded as unnecessary, common :
ownership- is practised, no courts are ;
required where heinous crime' is un- i
known, theft or personal violence is;
unbelievable, locks and keys are use-
less, immorality is npt extant, no i
elopements have been recorded, the
marriage vows have not been vio
lated in- a century, modesty is innate.
suffrage exists from: traditional times, ,
capital, and labor Is an unknown fea
ture in fhe. commercial and political
scheme, ministers do not exhort to
righteousness where sin is unknown
and the great principle of right as ;
opposed to wrong is the guiding law :
that governs all. '
Incidentally no taxes are necessary s
as the Crown, while accepting loyal i
tribute-of the people, demands noth- i
ing and supplies ihe necessities of ie-
fense. A guest is considered as suchi
and does not . have to pay for his en-
tertainment and lodging, no venomous f
reptiles orinseteta- exist and the feel
ing of fearis unknown.. A- Pitcairn
islander ; though -being an ; adept at
all the arts such as. painting, music,
carving, etc., would look askance at
such -frivolities as style, theatres and.
the amassing of fortune if transport
ed to America.
j These f ealures are vouched for by
Miss McCoy, (who after 16 years self-
expatriation from the island home of
her forefathers is still unable to ac
cent the beliefs ofcivilizatioti" as
well founded in . many respects.
Further confirmation of the customs
and social experiment that has been
tried on ' Pitcairn Island, which ma
terially corroberates Miss McCoy's
detailed statements is found in the
