All of the plantations-which figure

FOR THE FUTURE
Foreign Vessels May Call With
out Complying With Sea
man's Law Regulation
Honolulu has won a big point for
future transpacific 6t earner trade
Secretary of Commerce Redfield sig
nalized the point this morning by ca
bling to Collector of Customs Franklin
that Section 13 of the new Seamen's
Law does not apply to vessels calling
here for bunker coarand supplies.
In other words, foreign vessels ply
ing the Pacific may make calls here
1 for provisions and coal without hav
ing to comply with the costly and de
laying regulations of the act 'regard
ing employment of able seamen ' and
meeting the language test.
: Section 13 Is the regulation which
has aroused the most opposition to
the Seamen's Law. If foreign vessels
which wished to stop here briefly were
forced to comply with It. the regula
tion would he so onerous for them that
they would soon to avoid this port
Consequently the ruling made public
today means that foreign shipping is
to be encouraged to call here 'for pro
visions and coal.
Back of the cabled notice by Secre
tary Redfield there is the story of a

by the ' Honolulu Chamber of Com

M'BRYOE FIXED
50 CENTS SHARE
McBryde ..Sugar Company directors
met today and declared a dividend of
50 cents per share, payable June 20.
Any and all further matters -connected
with dividend policies are to he de
termined later and may then be an
nounced. This dividend is in iha same
amount as was paid last year in June
and December.
The oeclaration by McBryde direct
ors came as somewhat of a disappoint
ment to stockholders who were gen
erally desirous of seieng the stock put
on a basis of monthly dividends of at
least 10 cents per share. It had even
been rumored that such monthly basis
would be adopted and that the .pay
ment would be 15 cents.
The announcement that further ac
tion on dividends might be taken at
latter meetings and further announce
ments then made is taken by some as
meaning that the directors may yet
determine upon monthly disburse
ments. PROMOTE
Information has just been received
at the various Oahu army posts rela
tive to the examination of officers un
der the new bill now pending in Con
gress. With the passage of the bill there
will be a great number of promotions
in the array and it is estimated that
the examinations for promotions will
not be less than 1623. The first in
crement Will be effective July 1, so
that on that date there will be a large
number of promotions.
All officers will be examined at
their respective posts as no mileage
is available for officers of the board
to go from post to post and conduct
the examinations. This board is ap
pointed for each post by the depart
ment commander.
Officers will be informed from
Washington when the bill is approved.
As a guide to preliminary preparation
the post commanders have been ad
vised that the minimum estimate o'
the number of officers to be examined
indicates that the examination in vari-
lous grades and arms will include the
following men:
