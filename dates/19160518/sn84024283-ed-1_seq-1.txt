There i no mistaking the impetus of
the good roads movementin Missouri.
It is sweeping the State like a prairie
fire. The wisdom ot Democratic Leg
islatures is bearing fruit. The laws
tinder which p-ood roads bonds are
voted are all Democratic laws, and
are a splendid tribute to the con
strnctiva and patriotic statesmanship
ot the Democratic party. At last the
people of Missouri are coming to un
derstand that good roads are not made
at Jefferson City. Only the laws are
made there. Tbe roads must be made
at home, by setting in motion the
legal machinery which the State gov
ernment has provided. No State in
the Union has better road laws than
Missouri. The Democratic party has
seen to that. It la now up to the
' people to build the roads and they
are doing it too.
J. Silas Harris, president of the
"Negro Eepublican League of Mis
. souri", some name, is'nt it? an
nounces that nobody is authorized to
receive donations for the league; no
body, we presume, but J. Silas. Of
course, somebody must produce, or
Swanger can't be nominated.
"A l busted treasury and a looted
school fund!" The Republicans start
ed the cry twenty years ago. But
Missouri's public school system is still
working and growing, and that State
treasury is still open for business ev
ery day. 1 When the Republicans were
in the hey-day of their power and
glory in this State, they never took
the trouble to create a permanent
school fund. They robbed the cradle
before the baby was born. And as to
the State treasury, that was merely a
snap for a Repuplican politician. The
State's money whenever the State
had any money was loaned out ty
the Treasurer for his own benefit, and
he put the interest in his pocket I By
virtue of a Democratic law, passed by
a Democratic Legislature and signed
by a Democratic Governor, the State
now realizes a very handsome income
from "what, to the Republicans, was
only a source of private graft.
While swinging his municipal pie
eating brigade into line for Swanger
- for Governor, Mayor ' Henry Kiel of
St. Louis is doubtless not unmindful of
the fact that in the 'event of Swan
ger's election the police and election
commissioners of that benighted city
could be used to force the re-election
of one Henry Kiel to the office of
Mayor." ! ' '.' N ;, ' "
The St. Louis authorities assess the
property of that'city at seventy per
cent of its actual value. They have to
do this in order to get enough money
to supply tbe extravagant demands
of the Repuplican city administration
And the St. Louis Republican politi
cians, in order to hide their own bur-
: glarlous loot-prints, rush out into the
State, and scream and howl against
the State Board of Equalization for
not "equalizing" .tbe assessments
The St. Louis Republican gang know
very well that a reduction of the as
sessments in St. Louie city would bank
-rupt the city treasury.. But they are
not asking for that. Oh, no. Vhat
they want Is a doubling of tbe assess
ments in the country. How in the
namepf high Heaven could that help
St. Louis? It would not" and could
not help St. Louis at all, But there is
one thing that does help. The roar
' that it kept? up in the St. Louis news
papers helps to deceive the people of
St. Louis city, and that is its only
purpose. As long as those people
can be made to believe that all. their
trouble .comes from Jefferson City
they will continue to vote the Re
publican ticket. v
. There is one .thing about the State
University that is known to .every
man who has been a member of the
State Legislature, and that is simply
this: s If the University hasn't gotte'n
ail the money that was in 'the State
treasury, it wasn't because the Uni
versity never asked for it.
It may be remarkedin passing, that
one very good way to Injure the credit
of the State is to join in the general
Repuplican squawk that "the treasury
is busted." That kind of talk does not
help a State any more than it helps an
individual. We can see why Republi
cans would try, if they oould, to force
a Democratic State into bankruptcy.
Their policy is to ruin where they
cannot rule. ' But Democratic news
papers whlob lend their, columns
to that sort of a propaganda are cer
tainly getting off o'n the wrong foot.'

Jesse Pinkley Answers Call.
(LewlstownrfMon.) Democrat-News, Hay 2d)
Jesse E. Pinkley, deputy state stock
inspector, died at 8:45 last night at bis
residence, 308 Second avenue, south,
after a long Illness, aged 43 years. He
is survived by the widow and one
daughter; one brother, James Pink-"
ley of Missouri, who was at the bed
side, and a brother and sister, in ad
dition to other relatives, residing in
Missouri.
The decedtnt first became ill about
three months ago, and he submitted
to an operation. He Improved gradu
ally and perhaps three weeks ago took
up his duties again, his strength slowly
returning as he went about. On April ,
25th he returned to the city from a
trip to Butte,' Helena, and White
Sulphur Springs, but very soon after
getting home began to lose ground
again, although he was not confined to
his bed until a few. days ago. His
ailment, a vary serious liver trouble,
with complications, brought him down
rapidly and he was unconscious most
of yesterday. .
Mr. Pinkley came here from Mis
souri many years ago and was for
some years employed by David Hilger
and the Fergus people in the Armells
country. Removing to Lewistown,
he, engaged in the livery business,
conducting the Elkhorn stables for
several years. In 1904-5 he served aB
alderman from the second ward and
was then elected mayor. At the ex
piration of bis first term he was re
elected, thus serving four years as
mayor. Some time after his retire
ment from that office he became
deputy state Inspector, a position that
he held at the time of his death.
Mr. Pinkley waB a first-class stock
man and was widely known through
out the country. He was recognized
by all as a man of strict personal in
tegrity, loyal to his friends at .all
times, large hearted and charitable
and fearless in thedischarge of his
aeain.
(Democrat-News, May 4th.)
The whole community yesterday
paid its last tribute of respect to the
memory of former Mayor Jesse E.
Pinkley. The stores closed at two
o'clock and while the services were
in progress at the Methodist Chuch
business was suspended. The atten
dance at , the funeral strikingly
illustrated the eBteem in which the
former mayor was held. The" large
auditorium was far too small to ac
commodate the throngs, and while
many stood in the rear of the church,
many more remained on the side
walks, unable to get into the build
ing. , ' :
The Elks, who had charge of the
services, the Odd Fellows and the
Woodmen attended in bodies while
Mayor Symmes and the members of
the city council, with all the city of
ficials, were present. The casket was
completely covered with the numer
ous and beautiful floral tributes.
At the opening Mrs. E. A. Long and
her daughter, Miss Reatha Long, sang
a beautiful duet, and later Mrs. Long
gave a solo while the quartet, com
posed of Mrs. Long, Miss Long, Dick
Baker, and Walter Lehman were
heard In two selections. -
Rev. p. M. Donaldson delivered tbe
address, which was a notable "one.
He paid high tribute to Mr. Pinkley's
wortn ana nis aaaress was lull of con
soling thoughts.
