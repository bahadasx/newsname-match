A GOOD TIME TO ADVERTISE
The hackneyed old phrase, "Now Is
the time to advertise," has special
pertinence just now. It Is in times of
prosperity that money is made. As
the result of big crops, demand for
war munition, etc., the country has
reached a high stage of prosperity.
There is plenty of money In circula
tion and people are in a mood to buy
liberally.
In such times as these advertising
pays more generously than ever. The
people are hopeful and confident, dis
posed to anticipate their wants, to
buy the best qualities, and to purchase
things they would not hava felt they
could afford a year ago.
Merchants ought to be able to dou
ble their trade under these conditions.
Out they can't get it by waiting for it.
They must attract more attention, take
a little more newspaper space describe
their good x li iwim fully. A great
deal of mru v Lu 'pent in the next
six montl II o iii li i.l it with those
dealers, vt ceil .. ihe most publicity.
