MAJOR LADUE 'S VISIT
Held Public Hearing on Charlotte
Harbor Bridge
Major W. B. Ladue of Jackson
ville, United States engineer,
spent Thursday here holding a
public hearing. on the proposed
Charlotte Harbor bridge. As a
, result of the hearing, he will re
port favorable to a bridge from
the foot of Nesbit street across to
the town of Charlotte Harbor
with a fifty-foot draw at the
channel.
Representations to the Major
v about the needs for deeper water
hi this harbor were attentively
'. listened to and it is felt that he
. J saw good reasons for the desired
harbor improvements. Myakka
rivor improvement, however, had
been asked for by the people of
that section, and it was informa
tion bearing on that stream that
he wished to obtain. .
Punta Gorda may later get a
favorable report looking to the
deeper water that has so long
been contended for.

- iLimevInJ"y to Citrus Remedied
by Addition of Humus
A number of cases where young
citrus trees have been injured by
the application of ground lime
stone to a light sandy soil lacking
in humus have been found. The
following conditions, cited by B.
F. Floyd, plant physiologist to the
University of Florida Experiment
Station, are apparently common
to all: Ground limestone was used
on a soil already deficient in hu
mus and no steps were taken to
add humus making material to
the soil. No cover crops were
grown or turned under and nun-
iora
fertilizers were' used exclu
sively. The affected trees were
all less than 10 years old.
One grove was found where the
foregoing practice was followed
several years ago. The grower
began to use limited quantities of
oragnic sources ot ammonia and
method which growers will have
to follow to bring groves back to
condition if they have been injur-
ed by injudicious use of ground
limestone on soils beficient in hu
mus. Lime can be used but pro
vision should be made at the same
time to replenish the humus.
Spray for First Brood of White
Fly There are two practical meth
ods of controlling whiteflies, ac
cording to J. R. Watson, entomol
ogist to the University of Florida-!
Experiment Station.
One is by i
'spraying with contact insecticides
and the other is by aiding the;
spread of parasitic fungi. The
best method is a combination of i
the two. Owing to the dry weath -
er, which usually obtains in
J spring, spraying with insecticides
;is recommended for the spring
brood. It is time to do this
spraying in most parts of the
state. Spraying is especially im
portant this year owing to the un
usual drouth Which has hindered
the growth of controlling fungi.
The paraffin oil sprays are rec
ommended. Of course unless the
numbers of whiteflies in a grove
would justify- the expense of
spraying it should not be done.
Such conditions will obtain in
some sections, but spraying will
be necessary in most groves in
fested with the pests. If this

depend too much on fungi this

at cost to those who order early.
These orders will be filled when
the material is needed for the sec

Liming Thin
Soils May Injure
Citrus Trees
Young
Experience has shown that lime
in some form is good for citrus
trees in most eases. - However,
there are some soils which cannot
stand an application of lime un
less precautions are taken to add
humus. - li. b. Floyd, plant phy

This t.vnrt nr imnrv tins nppn re-
cently shown on young trees. The
ground limestone, stimulated
growth at first. The leaves were
deeper green and growth was
more rapid. After a few months
growth became repressed. The
foliage became badly frenched
and yellow. Many of the leaves
fell. The new stems were slen
der, new leaves were undersized
and yellowed. The older defoliat
ed steins showed distinct develop
ments of multiple buds.
The bark of the trunk and larg-
er branches appeared hide bound
The trees had the appearance of,
being attacked by withertip, ak
though few dead branches were
found in the trees. There was a
distinct absence of fresh white
fceding tips online fibrous roots.
The main rootf were apparently j
uninjured. J he cover crop re
fused to grow. Seedlings of both
wild and cultivated crops came
up. made a small growth and died.
Such conditions indicate a dead
soil. They should be remedied,
not by depriving the trees of lime,
but by adding organic material
through, cover crops, by inocula
tion through small amounts of
manure, in addition to the lime.
The foregoing discussion applies
to citrus trees not over 7 to 10
years old on light sandy soils
lacking in humus. The injury
has not been noted in trees above
this age.

The French official- statement
Tuesday afternoon tells of heavy
bombardment by the Germans of
the French positions in the Avo
court wood and about Hill 304,
and of a Gefman infantiy attack
northwest of Thiaumont farm
which was easily repulsed. A
side from this and sporadic bom
bardments at other points there
is nothing to report on the .west
ern front.
In the Auslro-Italian campaign
the Italians have resumed the of
fensive and for two days made
gains of ground in the zone about
Monte Adalcmon and at other
i points in their general advance
i toward Trentino. The Italian
war office describes these gains of
great strategic value. In the
Mount Sperone sector the Ital
ians have occupied .several posi
tions from which they drove the
Austrian forces. Austrian at
tacks at other points were repuls
ed, wkh heavy losses to the at
tackers. Petrograd reports further ad

Bagdad, the Turks continuing to

forts of the American column to
exterminate the scattered bands
of Villa followers in the district
occupied by Gen. J. J. Pershing's
command arc rapidly nearing a
culmination. The largest bands
have been broken and driven
south, but a few fugatives remain
in, the territory just south of the
field base at Namiquipa. This
was indicated by the attack made
by them upon twelve American
troiipers on a foraging expedition
recently. Unofficial reports here
indicated that flying columns of
cavalry are riding hard in an at
tempt to exterminate those who,
as long as they are at large, re
main an annoyance to the Ameri
can lines of communication.
Private advices indicate that
preparations are being made at
Colonia Dublan, 120 miles south
of the border, to concentrate
great quantities of supplies and
troops. Nothing can be learned
in this connection at military
headquarters, however.
With the interruption to the
regular army truck service be
tween Columbus and the field,
many tons of soldiers' mail have
collected in the army post office
here. Adding to the congestion
is'much matter which has been in
sufficiently addressed, no mail
not bearing the addressee's regi
ment being forwarded.
DISTRIBUTION OF TROOPS
Along the Border is Being Made
By Funston Patrol Stronger
San Antonio, Texas Distribu
tion of troops under the plan of
reorganization of the border pa
trol, on which General Funston
has been working since his return
from El Paso, was begun Tues
day. Troops will be placed so as
to give the utmost protection to
American communities along the
Mexican border.
Details of the plan for redis
tribution of the forces have not
been announced beyond the state
ment of General Funston that
strong detachments will be sta
tioned at the bridges and towns
along the Southern Pacific rail
road to safeguard the line, be
cause of its strategic value. Or
ders will be issued assigning sev
eral companies of coast artillery,
now at Fort Sam Houston, to the
work of guarding bridges.
In rearrangmg troops along the
border General Funston is striv
ing to unite regimental force.s.
Some of the regiments have be
come very much scattered and
these will now be brought togeth
er as far as it is possible.
