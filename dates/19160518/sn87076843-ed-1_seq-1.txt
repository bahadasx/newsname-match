Everything was set for a good
ball game last Sunday, but the
rain came and put an end to the
fans' happiness for that day.
Next Sunday the General Furni
tures will be here for a game with
the local team.
Last year this club went 12
innings before taking defeat.
Come out and enjoy a good
game and "root" for the home
team.
The Perrysburg Juniors defeat
ed Bowling Green Centrals at
Bowling Green on Sunday last 12
to 4. The game was played be
tween showers.
P. H. S. DRAMATICS.
'A Strenuous Life" Will be the
Closing Offering.
The P. II. S. Dramatic Society
will bring its second year to a
close on Wednesday, May 31, with
the largest piece that the society
has ever attempted.
"A strenuous Life" is the name
of the play, and was written by
Richard Tully, author of "The
Bird of Paradise" and "Omar the
Tentmaker," and had a run of 28
weeks at the David Belasco theatre
in New York City. The host in the
school have been picked for parts
and a professional coach will stage
the piece. The plot is complex
and very funny, with a laugh in
every line.
Tom Harrington, with Edmund
Schuster in this role, is forced to
tell contradicting stories in order
to save himself from humiliation.
Reginald Black, played by Carle
ton Finkbeiner, is a different sort
of a fellow, but tries hard to pro
tect Tom. They initiate the new
Professor, Arthur Mcintosh, and
make the Freshman, Donal Pheley,
play the part of the Professor.
The principals, of course, are en
tangled in serious affairs with the
ladies, and the prevarications of
Tom nearly bring them all to
naught. But all is settled by a
"mighty" fib by Tom, who is then
acclaimed the hero.

Perrysburg, this summer, will
celebrate the one hundredth anni
versary of her existence as a vil
lage of the Hanniee Valley. For
this important occasion, she has
already dressed herself in her gar
ment of green, and her beauty is
apparent everywhere. To write
her real history during this period,
from 181C to 1916, would be next
to impossible. As is the case with
all communities, only the more
important acts and happenings
have been recorded, and much con
cerning her as a town, those lit
tle, yet very important, items of
interest, are preserved only in
memory or in private papers that
have been hidden away for years
in some dark cellar or garret to be
forgotten.
Occasionally, some of our old
pioneers will become talkative and
tell us of the past. But most of
these, are they not sleeping be
neath the green sward of our sev
eral, burying grounds, over which
wave tall and somber pines; and,
as those sad sentinels of the dead
sway to the breeze, they seem to
tell us the story of forgotten times
and past occurrences.
Perry.sburg, in early days, was
the principal way point that
travellers passed through on their
emigrant excursion to the great
Northwest. It was tho one place
which when reached that gave
real cheer to the driver of the ox
team and the emigrants of the old
"Prairie Schooner."
LTere they rested and 'obtained
supplies for a fresh start into the
wilderness, where they were to en
dure the trials that were to re
deem the land and make it a fit
habitation for the generations of
the future.
Perrysburg, in early times, was
also an unique place, quite inde
pendent, in that it did not rely
upon the rest of the world for its
supplies or necessaries of life.
It had its own mills, wagon
shops, shoe shops, tanneries, wool
en factories, schools, stores, and in
fact every manufactory that was
needed to supply its people with
the comforts of life, while the
land around furnished everything
that heart could wish. It did a
large shipping business and was
the western terminus of all lake
boats plying upon Lake Erie.
Great ship yards dotted the banks
of the Maumee ; large vessels with
tall mastb lay at their moorings;
burly sailors and square shoul
dered ship captains walked our
streets, and the hum of many in
dustries was music to the primi
tive peoples here in this western
wild.
The forests were filled with
game and the river supplied tons
of fish and the people had no rea
son other than to be happy and
contented in their new western
home.
The life of every man, every
city, and every nation is divided
into periods.
These periods aro usually
chosen, because they are the real
mile-stones used in the narration
of events. They are important
epochs that will always be re
membered and referred to for
they designate those times that
June been productive of suffering,
of sacrifice and loyalty, one to an
other. For instance, old residents speak
of "Tho time before the Cholera
Year," "Between the Cholera
Year and tho War," "After the
"War," etc. To my mind, theso
three periods divide into interest
ing phases tho lifo of this old, but
(Continued on Eighth Page.)
The year 191G is the centennial
year of tho birtli of Perrysburg,
and it is proposed that the village
shall give a celebration in keeping
with the importance of the event.
Every citizen of the village
should feel it his duty to partici
pate in the celebration with his
energy and a contribution of cash
necessary to defray the expense of
producing a program that will be
a credit to the town and be evi
dence of the progress that has
characterized the events of the
past century in Perrysburg.
It is a large undertaking and in
order to make it a success there
must be a united effort made by
all the people.
A committee will call on every
citizen and ask for contributions
and unless a sufficient amount is
raised there will be no celebration.
If the committee misses you, just
come to either of tho banks and
leave your money with the cashier.
It is necessary that every citizen
shall help.
It's a question of "get the
money."
"Will the citizens produce? No
money no celebration. Now it's
up to you, Mr. good citizen:
Shall we celebrate or back up and
quit?
IN MEMORIAM.
The following resolutions were
adopted by Wolford Post, No. 51, G. A.
R., Department of Ohio:
The comrades of Wolford Post, No.
51, G. A. R., of Ohio, are called to
drape their hall and charter and mourn
the loss of our esteemed comrade,
late of Co. I, 111th 0. V. I.
Therefore, we, your committee, in
testimony of his loyalty to his country,
when her glorious principles of free
dom were assailed, to his private char
acter as a citizen, and as a true and
loyal member of the Grand Army of
the Republic, recommend that a copy
of this expression of our regard for the
fallen comrade be sent to his family.
