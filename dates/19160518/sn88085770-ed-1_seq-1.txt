Fifteen rebels who took part in the
Irish revolt have been court-martialed
and shot by the British military au
thorities in Ireland. Among these
was James Connolly, well known So
cialist editor and lecturer.
Nineteen others were sentenced to
death, but the sentence was commut
ed to penal servitude. On three oth
ers prison terms were imposed. Two
were acquitted.
Clemency for James Connolly was
asked in a cablegram sent Sunday to
Premier Asquith by officials of the
Chicago Federation of Labor.
INTERNATIONAL
BUREAU TO MEET
The first meeting since the begin
ning of the war of the International
Socialist Bureau will be held at The
Hague on June 26, according to plans
announced in New York. This will
not be a general congress, since it
will include representatives only of
neutral countries. However, it will
be more than a merely »neutral con
ference, such as was held by the Scan
dinavian countries. It was called by
the International Socialist Bureau,
and may be followed by others.
GIRL EXPLAINS REASON
SHE LEADS STRIKE
(Anna Bell, 20-year-old girl of
Pittsburg, the center of several big
strikes, is called the pride of the strik
ers, among whom she is a leader. Dur
ing the strikes she has been arrested
twice in less than a week, once on a
charge of attacking a strike-breaker,
and again on a charge of murder. Her
story of why she is a strike leader is
told here in a statement for The Call.)
By Anna Bell.
(In an Interview With a Call Corre-
spondent.)
I am a strike leader because I be
lieve working men and women are im
posed upon by capitalists! If some
person does not lead them against op
pression, they never will be helped.
I have no personal grievance in the
present strike.
I believe in an eight-hour day and
am willing to make any sacrifice to
get it.
I do not believe in violence on the
part of strikers. »
*'( Capitalists abuse us in the ways in
which they are powerful. They make
us work long hours, and they sus
pend or discharge us at will.
They cut our wages when they see
fit.
They speed us up at piece work or
give us work at which we have to al
most kill ourselves to make a living.
We have only one advantage—
must have our labor.
So the only way we can combat
them succesfully is to take away the
only thing precious and needful to
them—our toil.
COST OF CHEAP
LIVING STILL RISING
The cost of living is still soaring.
While the price of food, taken as a
whole, declined 2 per cent from Jan
uary 15 to February 15, 1916, reports
to the Bureau of Labor Statistics
from approximately 725 retail dealers
in cities of the United States, cover
ing the principal staple articles of
food, show that relative combined
prices of these foods in February,
1916, was 5 per cent higher than in
February, 1915 and 1914, and 9 per
cent higher than in February, 1912
and 1913.
The records show that prior to the
war in Germany one man in 213 went
to college; in Scotland, one in 520; in
the United States, one in 2,000; and
in England, one in 5,000.

Tho French section of the Women's
Federation for Permanent Peace has
issued a leaflet, from which the fol
lowing' statements are reproduced:
"During one year several million
men have been killed. Among them
are 600,000 dead Frenchmen. All Eu
ropean nations have been bled. Those
dead are not elements who can In
spared by the nation. War has picked
off the best of our men. The whole
strength and the entire wealth of
France are spent with this blood.
"How many good workers have we
lost? The labors of the past, this
valuable reserve, we also destroyed
by every hour of this war. Every 50
days France is spending $1,000,000,
--000 for war.
This War Dlfercnt
"This is the war which has been
glorified so much for its alleged bene
fits to the nation. It is a war far dif
ferent from those that have gone be
fore. Formerly the vast majority of
the nation did not go to war. Only
the meeting of the armies decided the
issue. For the first time in the his
tory of the world, whole nations are
drawn into the war and pitted against
one another. More than 20,000,000
men of all ages are facing each other.
"The nations who agree to all these
sacrifices for more than a year, all be
lieve in the justice and sacredness of
their cause. For this reason all of
them repeat the same phrases: De
fense of the threatened fatherland,
liberation of suppressed people,
achievement of a permanent peace,

"It will be best to ask ourselves
whether a prolongation of this war
can bring any inestimable benefits to
the nation. What we might win in

3 BRITISH SOCIALISTS
GET PRISON SENTENCES
EDINBURGH. — Three Socialists
were sentenced to terms of imprison

in the high court here after pleading
guilty to advising munition workers
at Glasgow last March to quit work.
James MacDougall, a member of
the school board, and James Maxton,
a school teacher, were sentenced to
12 months' imprisonment each.
Jack Smith, a toolmaker, received
a sentence of 18 months.
Last week's article dealing with this
case showed that three others had
been sentenced to 12 months imprison

one in France has ever seriously ex
pected it.
'The liberation of oppressed , na
tions? People forget all 100 easily
that very different nations, for in
stance, Russia as wel as Germany and
Austria, divide the honors of bending
other nations under their yoke.
"At all events the problems arising
from the claims of the various na
tionalities are so complicated that
only peace can solve them by great
international congresses. It is a mat
ter of course that neither .in annexa
tion nor any change in territory
should be undertaken without consult
ing the nations involved.
"A permanent peace? Does anybody]
still believe that it can be achieved by
force of arms? Does anybody still
think that militarism anywhere can be
crushed by wars?
"The only explanation remaining is
that the war must be continued for
economic advantages. In fact, how
ever, a military victory can not Insure
the economic supremacy of a nation.
(In the other hand, no military defeat
can prevent 100,000,000 of intelligent
and determined men from laboring as
they did before the war, to produce
and market goods.
"So the most popular idea is to levy
an enormous war indemnity on the
enemy. Looking merely on our own
expenses, we find that France, Eng
land, Belgium, Italy, Russia and Ser
via have spent about $20,000,000,000
so far. Even if it could be admitted
that the enemy might be able to pay
such an immense contribution, he
would first have to be so completely
defeated as neither Caesar nor Na

HO! TO MEXICO
(An Appeal to Patriotism)
By E. C. Hunter
Ho! worker, Ho!
In Mexico
The bold bandits are fighting.
See! worker, See!
My property
Will soon be gone a-kiting.
Run! worker, Run!
And get a gun,
And turn their bold plans under.
Shoot! worker, Shoot!
Each damned galoot
And blow them all to thunder.
With all your might
On fields death-strewn and gory.
While we remain
To drink champagne
And sing your praise and glory.
Die! worker, die.
Up in the sky
Is a land of milk and honey,
And mansions rare
Built of hot air
For suckers like you, sonny.

AMSTERDAM. — Dr. Karl Lieb
knecht, the German Socialist leader,
who was arrested in the May Day
peace demonstration in Berlin, may be
ordered to join his regiment at the
front, according to reports received
here.
Several German opponents of Lieb
knecht suggested several weeks ago
that the government relieve itself of
further attacks by Liebknecht by or
dering him into service. The fact
that he has been summoned for trial
before a military instead of a civil
tribunal leads to the belief that the
government is to follow this advice.
More than 4,000 men and women
in New York city make a living in so
cial work, supported by private phil
anthropy. One social worker is paid
$10,000 a year, eight receive 35,000 or
more, and the salaries of 758 subor
dinates aggregate $859,000 annually.
Altogether the salaried workers in
the private charities of the city are
as numerous as authors, editors, re

than clergymen, architects, dentists or

The Gernyin authorities are still

police in the several localities that,
according to orders, no public or mem

which the question of the franchise
for women or matters connected with
the Socialistp rogram were to be
touched upon in any form whatsoever.
The series of meetings was aban

Dusseldorf, a number of meetings for
women that were to have been held
were prohibited by order of the presi

WAR VETERANS
CREATE PROBLEM
Displace Organized Workers By
Cheap Wages and Burden
Colony With Cripples
The Western Clarion is not very
much pleased over the return of the
conquering heroes whom England is
dumping into Canada. These veter
ans, instead of being taken care of by
the British government, are left to
shift for themselves after having been
shipped to Canada. Being in dire need,
they take more and more jobs away
from the organized workers, cheapen
wages, and increase the unemployed
problem.
"These be wonderful times," says
The Western Clarion. . "Even the
British capitalists are foreseeing
things. Whether it will be the things
they foresee that will happen to them
or not remains to be seen.
"They now foresee that, at the end
of the war their army, or what is left
of it, is likely to be a problem. What
is to be done about the soldier when
he returns home, after kicking the
peas out of the Prussian peril, of
course His life in the trenches will
have unfitted him for his former avo
cation, we are informed, and we sus
pect that his former avocation has
also been fitted, in the meantime, on
to a woman at half the wages.
"Under ordinary circumstances, of
course, he could be given a hearty pat
-on his pants-seat and an honorable
transfer to the army of the unemploy
ed, where he could serve his country
yet again by helping to reduce to a
reasonable frame of mind such mis
creants as the bloated coal miners and
freight humpers. But, with the mu
nition plants closing down and what
not, there promises to be no lack of
recruits for the unemployed army,
'and the returned hero may not be in
a reasonable frame of mind himself.
"So there will be some millions of
him, and endowed with the cohesive
ness essential to the making of an
army. If he, finding himself with
out means of livelihood and without
prospects, should set out to do some
thing about it, his cohesiveness would
make him altogether too formidable
to be meddled with. Consequently,
the grateful taxpayer must do some
thing about him, if not for him. He
is therefore to be 'emigrated.' Scat
ter him to the four corners of the
earth and he loses his cohesiveness.
Let him go and build up our overseas
empire. How he will fare there is a
matter of no concern. His king and
country need him no more. And so
that problem will be solved in true
British fashion by being foisted off
onto someone else. Let the colonies
wrestle with it!"
