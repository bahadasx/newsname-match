Chicago, May 12th, 1916
Mr. R.L. Martin,
C-o General Delivery,
Okoiona, Miss.
Dear Mr. Martin:
Your wire stating Okoiona
signed contract for 1917 Chau
tauqua, on morning -of second
day of our present session, re
ceived yesterday. To date, this
early renewal is without ques
tion a record. If the people of
Okoiona are so appreciative o
said program as this, what wil
be their condition at the end - o
our stay there? It is fine o:
them indeed, and it is the best
possible indication that Okoiona
is to be an established Chautau
qua Community. You know
someone says they put a canary
bird in a coal mine to determine
whether the atmosphere is fit for
the men to live in. We think
the same may be said of the
Chautauqua which visits a town
for th firfet time, and , the wel
come they give it is an indica
tion, as to whether or not it is a
good community in which to live.
Following this reasoning out, to
its natural conclusion, Okoiona
would be a desirable place in
which to spend ones' days.
Heartiest congratulations t o
you and to the good people of
Okoiona, and to my good friend
Price.
Sincerely yours,

HOW TO LIVE
100 YEARS
Some
Dr.
of the Good Things in
Uarker's Lecture Satur
day Evening
Dr. Barker said in part:
"Every year is adding to our
knowledge of how to prevent
disease and prolong life.
"The experiments and discov
eries of the past ten years by
scientists and , physicians have
been most remarkable in this
field, and the day is not far dis
tant when men and women can,
by following up these conclusions
liv to a ripe old age and never
be sick a day in that time, and
simply die of being worn out.
"In getting and keeping the
bodyjn a state of perfect health,
attention must be paid to at least
four things. Elimination of im
purities from the system, diet,
the mental condition and regu
lar exercise.
"Three minuets of breathing
exercises should be taken each
day to keep the chest , expansion
up to normal.
"The pores of the skin should
be kept open, either by exercise
of a daily dry friction bath with
flesh-brushes, or fibrous mits.
"Underwear especially in the
winter clogs the pores of the
skin and to offset this, a friction
bath is very helpful.
"The third organ of elimination
the intestines, has much ' to
do with the health or disease.
"Though it is a very prevalent
disease, intestinal - slugglishness,
or constipation, shortens lite
many years and leads to many
other very serious ailments.
But it is entirely unnecessa
ry and can, in nine cases out of
ten, be cured by exercise and
proper diet. Exercise e a c n
morning the mucels of the abdo
mendon't eat meat and eggs
until cured, but partake freely of
cereals, green vegetables and
fruit, and drink from eight to
twelve glasses of water each
day.
In the second place the diet
plays a big part in the matter of i
health and disease.
By studying the habits of the
Bulgarians who live much longer
pn the average than any other
race of civilized people, Dr.
Mechnikoff, who is the greatest
authority in the world on pro-
onging life, gives as his conclu-
sion, tnat meat snouia never oe
eaten but once a day and that
sparingly; that the bulk of ; the
diet should consist of green veg
etables, fruit and cereals, and
that the habit of drinking some
buttermilk every, day v will do
much - to keep . one well and
lengthen life. '
"Another1 thing one" should by
will-power learn ' to chew the
food slowly. - Most "p f the
stomach troubles come from the
habit of eating rapidly.
"Third, cheerfulness and con
tentment will do much to
lengthen life. ' " -
"Many people bring on disease
and shorten their lives by years
by getting into the habit of
worrying.
This like any ' other habit
can be changed by any man or j
woman, who will use determina
tion and will power and learn to
look always on the bright side of ,
life.. r .
"Last, but not least get into
the habit of taking some kind of
systematic exercise each day;
Not the kind of exercise taught
years ago, which , developes
merely the arms and limbs, but
that kind which brings into play
the mucels of the abdomen and
cnest. Any system of home ex
ercises. if taken TniVloratoltr
every day will do ..wonders in
keeping the body in a state of
magnificent vitality, but niostj
people are too lazy to do this. !
the ni-fet thing in the .morning,
but it can be done before the
other meals or before retiring
at night."
At the close of his lecture Dr.
Barker took off his coat, and to
the intense interest of every
body demostrated a set of simple
exercises which he declared any
person not having serious heart
trouble could take with great
benefit to his health. -

Perfect BeatituJ
Our good friend, Mr.
Hutto, one of the leading citK
zens oi the tilth District, was in
town Tuesday and in a conversa
tion with the editor of the News-
Beacon remarked that he had
plenty of home cured bacon in
jiis smoke house, plenty of corn
in his crib, plenty of hogs to
make his coming winter'3 meat,
plenty of cows to give his family
an abundance df milk and butter,
lots of cattle and sheep on his
pasture, plenty of land to meet
all his requirements 1 and money
enougn to keep irom owing any
man anything and to buy all that
he needed and he further re
marked that as far as his finan
cial condition was concerned he
would not be affected if the Ger
mans and French ' fought until
they exterminated each other.
This is truly a happy conditidn
for a man to achieve, and it is
only by those traits of careful
management and judicious in
vestment, that all men ought to
have which has brought Mr.
Hutto his success. Waynesboro
COMFORTING WORDS
Many an Okoiona Household Will
Find Them So.
To hare the pains and aches of a
bad back removed to - be entirely
free from annoying, dangerous uri
nary disorders, is enough to make any
kidney sufferer grateful. The follow
ing advice of one who has suffered
will prove comforting words to hun
dreds of Okoiona readers. ,
Mrs. J. C. Droke, Silver St., Oko
iona, says: "I had been feeling tired,
run down and all outu of sorts for
some time. I had no strength or ener
gy ana by spells it just seemed as
if I would collapse. - My back was
weak and always distressed me more

It Is asserted and also denied that
porridge was the' cause of Thomas
Carlyle'e ruined digestion. Sir Rich
ard Quala said porridge had nothing
to do with his ruined digestion. Sir
Richard stated in the British Medical
Journal of November , 1S55, that "the
wretched dyspepsia to which Mr. Car
lyle was subjected was fully accounted
for by the fact that he was particular
ly fond of very nasty gingerbread.
Many times I have seen him sitting la
the corner smoking a clay pipe aa4
eating this gingerbread."
