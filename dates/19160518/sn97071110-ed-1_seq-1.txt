SENATOR CUMMINS
GRILLS DEMOCRACY
From hia pubHe address of 90 min
utes, to an overflowing crowd in Hood
River'a largest auditorium the liatener,
lacking previoua - Information, would
never have known that Senator Albert
Cummins, who arrived here at noon
over tbe uoiumbia river highway and
who proceeded Monday afternoon to
The Dallea, aspired to the Republican
nomination for presidency. Without
uttering e alngle word directly in hia
own behalf. Senator Cummiaa quoted
tbe memorable aaying of Abraham Lin
coln, "A houae divided against itself
will fall." and devoted hia time calling
Republican to the eolora and a grilling
of the present Democratic administra
tion.
The 1913 tariff law waa tbe eoncret-
est compound- of ignorance tbat aver
disgraced the annala of American legis
lative history." and "The attitude of
the administration toward Mexico ia
one of the moat shameful pages aver
written In" American history," were
two of the bluntly ottered phrases of
senator cummins.
j "Reeourceei of yoor great North
west," said Senator Cummins, "have
been looked op Decease ef an ignorance
af congressmen. Instead of making an
appropriation to send William G. Mc-
Adoo. wboae onlv distinction so far aa
1 know ia that of being aon-ln-law of
Woodrow Wilson, and a company of
Democrats on a junket to South Amer
ica, I would be favorable rather, aa I
said recently on tbe floor of the senate,
to make an appropriation to send every
member of congress to tbe Pacific coast
every year."
senator cummina waa entertained
while here' more aa a viaiting distin
guished citizen than aa a partisan can
didate. A ' luncheon tendered him at
tba Hotal Oregon by the Hawkeye
club, which according to W. F. Lara-
way, ia president, numbers 700 mem
bers In tbe Hood River valley, was at
tended by many prominent Democrats.
senator cummina waa brought to
Hood River over the Columbia river
highway by Phil Metcaban, Jr., in tbe
latter'a automobile. A atop waa made
at tha Bonneville fish hatchery. Oth
era of the party were L. C. Kurti, of
Dea Moines, la., and Geo. C. Howard.
of Portland.
The diatinguiahed visitor prefaced his
addraaa with an indirect eulogy of the
man wbe cooked -the good dinner and
an expression of hie amasement of the
wendera aeen from the Columbia river
highway. ' "1 have aeen moat of the
wonder spots ef the world accessible to
man." be and. ''and I bave aeen notfr
ing that can compare with the' high
way."
Senator Cummine waa Introduced by
Attoren Smiths George Washington
was the father of "hia country, and
Hon. E. L. Smith ia juatly called tha
father of Hood River," aaid Mr.Smith,
but our own W. r. Laraway Ia the
father Of Iowa." Mr. Larawavj cresl
dent of the local "Cummins for Presi
dent" club, and W. F. Wabrer, its see
retary, had charge of the arrangements
for Senator cummins' entertainment,
and it ia likely that the aenator will
never forget the visit.
The stand taken by senator uummtns
on tba passage of the bill by the uem
ocratio adminiatration, permitting for
aign vessels to pass through the Pane
ma canal on the same terma of as
American manned and registered vea
sels and hia vlewa on conservation were
both highly pleasing to hit audience,
"I am a conservationist." said Sena
tor Cummins, "but I believe tbat you
must use water power and aoil to prop
erly conserve it. I believe you people
of Oregon can more properly aaminis
tar the1 development - or yoor water
power reeoureea than can the federal
government."
"1 am in favor of an army ana navy
that will make it impossible for a for
aign nation to plant ita feet upon
American sou. and with a sect in ra-
ciflc waters aa well as in the Atlantic,"
ba aaid. "
While here Senatr Cummins waa pre
sented with Hood River applea by E.
u, Sbepard and w. f . Andrews.

"In my visits to different northwest

on Hood River. Several yeara ago I
attended a farmers' institute here. I
was scheduled to apeak on eowa. Ac
tually a lot ot tba orchardiata didn't
want me to talk. Tbe main topic of
discussion was fertilizer. When it
came my turn, after all forms of com
eerdal fertilisera had been talked of
from all angles, I prefaced my speech
by aaying, 'The beat fertilizer manu
facturer for tbe orcbardist la a dairy
cow.' My words got the attention of
many of the apple growers, and I be
lieve that the ramarka sowed the aeed
that haa led to your successful diversity
of farming."
