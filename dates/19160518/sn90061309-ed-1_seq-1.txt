traveled I in high water across the

very much delayed. Mrs. Corder
and baby expect to stay here sev
eral weeks longer.
Mrs. Lula Aulon was called to

A Musical Treat
Three a ncerts were put on last
week under the management of
Prof. Goetz whoes reputation in
this part of the country as a musi-'t""1
cian is an enviable one The first
was in the State Normal School at
Kirksville, the second at Moberlyj'y "'"" " V ' "r" ' "' was
and the third at Paris.
Miss Amelia Goetz was a soldi st
in each concert. Miss Marguerite
Dunlap of New York, a contralto
singer, assisted at Kirksville and
Moberly. Mr. Glenn Lee, a tenor
singer of St. Louis, assisted at Paris.
A childrens chorus gave two
numbers at Paris.
One of the special features at
Kirksville was two movements
from the Mozart Jupiter Symphony
which was rendered on three pianos
two persons at each piano. The
orchestra was composed of fort y
pieces and was a rare treat.
These concerts take the place of
the May Featival that were given
in the past under the management
of Prof. Goetz.
Messrs E. A Thompson and
Carrol Jaekson assisted in the three
concerts and Miss Bess Montgomery
on Friday and Saturday evenings.
We trust the time is not far off
when Monroe City may be on Prof.
Goetze's list of concert towns.
Laundry Again Changes Hands.
Monday Elmer Montgomery
bought out Jesse Humphrey's
interest in the Monroe Steam Laun
dry. The firm is now Osbiirne
& Montgomery. Mr. Montgomery
was horn and reared near Indian
Creek. He is so well known in
ibis community that he needs no
introduction. He has been located
in Monroe City since Mirch 1st.
Success to the new firm
High School Entertainment.
Ihe high school entertainment of
tne year was given at the auditori
um Tuesday evening It was the
comic operetta "Pocahontas." The
high school has given a series of
literary programs uuring tne year
anil the attendance increased at
each entertainment until toward the
last you had to go early to get a
seat Ihese have been free and
Tuesday evening a record breaking
crowd was expected. They did have
a good patronage but not what they
deseived. This was their first
operetta and was put on to show
what could he done in a musical
line The success of the entertain-1
mem is due lamely to Mrs. Bouch
cr. She devoted her time for the
past three weeks to drilling the
young p ople. She has brought
out talent that prior to this was un
discovered. She has shown what
can be done in a short time and the
patrons of the school as well as the
children, owe her at least a vote of
thanks for her work. We hope the
time is not far off when we may have
i the benefit of instruction in this
i line in our scluxd The Symphony
Orchestra ussisted giving their time
: freely to help along an I their sup-
port added greatly to the success
! of the evening. Mr. Boucher and
! the teachers have always given
their time to outside work and de
velopment along these lines do the
i pupils as much good as the study
of any regular subjects. Everyone
was pleased with Tuesday evenings
entertainment and whenever you
miss a program given by the school
you miss a treat.
