From the Tonale pass region in I
Westera Trenttno to Monfalcone, a;
short distance from the head of tlie j
Gulf of Triest, the Austrians are vig-!
orously on the offensive against the -
Italians. In Tvrol, to tlie south of
Trent, heavy infantry attacks to the j
east of the Adige river have forced
the Italians again to abandon some of
uic iiaitauo n^aixi uuauumi num- ui
their advanced positions and resulted
in the capture by the Austrians of an
aggregate of 141 officers and 6,2001
...... i„ __io ........ n ____
men. In addition, 13 guns and 17 ma-,
chine guns were captured. Vienna
says that south of Rovereto the Aus
trians stormed Zegnatorta, but Rome
asserts that the five attacks launched
were put down with heavy casualties,
the bodies of numerous dead Aus
trians floating away in the swift cur
rent of tlie Adige river. The repulse of 1
another Austrian attack in the Sugaim
valley also is reported by Rome. Along
the remainder of the front there were
heavy artillery bombardments with
here and there Infantry attacks. Bomb
ing operations by aviators on both
sides have taken place against oppos
ing positions.
On the front in France and Belgium
the fighting has consisted mainly
artillery duels to the northwest

DUBLIN, May 17. Premier As

impressions gathered during his Irish

future government must be conducted
an entirely different system.
The prime minister has taken care
to learn the ideas and views of many

offered greatly varied suggestions,

MAKES VALUABLE SUGGESTONS
AT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
LUNCHEON SATURDAY.
----
ALSO MAKES ADDRESS TO WOMEN
...........
The visit of Nets Darling in Lewis •
town is one which will leave its im.
pression for many days to come. A t
tile chamber of commerce noonday
luncheon held Haturdny at the Bright
cufi> lie addressed 125 representative
business men all of whom were alert
ly interested before lie had spoken a
dozen words. As one man In Kan
sa ssaid: "It is useless to say any
thing about Darling, lie is the real
goods."
That lie is the "real goods" seems
to be the concensus of opinion of all
who heard him yesterday. As one
man put it: "lie is the biggest ex
pert of his kind that ever visited this
city, and while others Have come and
gone and been forgotten the Hongs he
said hit home."
Activity Stimulated,
it is difficult (o give an idea of
the countless valuable
given by Mr. Darling SatSV^by!
which this community broadens out
and expand, physically, materially and
morally, and lie also bail many a good
word for Lewistown and the things
which have been accomplished hern
within the past three years. By num
berous well told stories and anecdotes
lie emphasized his points with greater
force than any arguments could have
done, and in consequence instilled in
to tlie chamber of commerce members,
whoare active at all times, an am
bition to he up and doing with a will
and intelligence to make Lewistown
the best town in the state. Mr. Darl
ing thoroughly approved of the efforts
of tlie chamber of commerce and city
council to provide a public play
ground for the city's amusement and
it is likely that through his stimuiut
jiing talk this plan will be an assured
accomplishment.
To the Women.
At the. meeting for women, held at
the Baptist church at 3 o'clock, lie
added another plume to his cap in
completely winning over women of
tlie city as well as the men.
It is in the power of women in
organized civic endeavor to bring any
city to the goal ot its highest ideals.
A city, said lie, is never better than
its womanhood and with its women
lies its greatest power to attain moral
anil physical cleanliness. He made
a powerful appeal for absolute clean
liness in Lewistown and education of
women in the care of their home and
children.
That this will be a better city be
cause Mr. Darling visited it there can
bo little doubt. He cante hero a wel
come visitor and lie goes thrice wel
come to return.

GENEVA. May 17.—Via Paris,

Jlong the Swiss-Alaatian frontier,
chiefly elderly men of the land
sturm, have begun to ask food
from the Swiss soldiers. The
Germans say they have not eat
en meat for weeks. Five Ger
man soldiers in uniform, al
though fired upon, escaped
across the Swiss frontier at
Rodersdorf, near Basel, yester
day. They were interned at
Berne. The Nume Stuttgarter
Zeitung says the food situation
in Rhine towns is becoming in
tolerable. The newspaper ad
vises the government to take
drastic measures to change the
mode of living of the people. It
suggests that cooking in private
families be prohibited and that
the population be ordered to eat
in common restaurants, where
meat would be served once daily,
at noon, and only vegetables in
the evening. Eighteen German
cattle dealers arrived in Basel
yesterday hoping to buy cattle,
which are becoming scarce.
