and Ambition Are Going
If you are a candidate in this rac<
don't be ashamed of it. Don't go 01
record as being in the "receptive
class". Strong men and women o:
this age are not tucking themselve:
away in some dark corner awaiting
the arrival of some Columbus to dis
cover their talents. Active, aggres
Bive, concentrated energy is the fab
lie of which success is woven in thii
bustling, turbulent old world.
It's the love of the game, the lau
rels of the winner, that makes an]
athletic game popular; it's the lov<
of the fight,the satisfaction of know
ing that you have succeeded, thai
moiroa arnrth thp livinir: and s<
in a competition like this, it is th<
fun of working, the interest of ri
valry that makes the prizes wortl
more than their mere cash value.
The live wire is the only effectiv<
wire. Be one yourself. Be full of en
ergy charged to the limit of power
It will carry you far and will at onc<
communicate a spark of enthusiasn
^ to the person whom you are tryiaf
^ to interest in your campaign. Yoi
V cannot give what you do not posses:
and unless you feel confidence, en
ergy and enthusiasm, you canno
/ arouse interest among your friends
f The special prizes for the highes
numbers of new subscriptions wil
be given May. 27. Candidates in ?>is
trict No 1 must have their subscrip
tions entered at The Record offic
before 7 o'clock Saturday evening
Hay 27. Candidates living in 1/19
& tript No 2 will be allowed to mai
their subscriptions Saturday even
ing. This gives the candidates ii
District No 2 a chance to work u]
to Saturday night, May 27,when the;
can mail in their subscriptions anc
they will be counted on the prizes
All that is necessary is that the let
ter bears a postmark of Mav 27
1916.
Do not let your competitors read
your friends and neighbors befor
you do. It is rather discouraging t
approach a friend whose assistano
T you have been counting on, only t
find that your friend has just sub
scribed for some other lady.
Get into immediate touch with al
your friends and relatives, either ii
person or by phone or mail, and asl
them to save their tickets, coupon
and'subscriptions for you. Get thei
promise at least and get the sub
scriptions later on. Do not put thi
off; it is one of the important detail
of the contest.

and Dargan streets, occupied by Ik<

fire to fight,hidden away under a lo
of empty boxes in a part of the ston

1 Fishing is the only business in

- and that business is being worked
t for all there is in it. Lynch's lake
5 has a well-trod "tow path" on each
- side; and every pike not yet deceas*
ed. had better make his will. A
1 good part of the population are
spending their time largely in the
- swamps, and they are catching fish,
* too. We have heard of but a single
* instance where a man who went af*
ter fish failed to get them, and in
1 that instance the man got something.
I He came back well "primed" and
J orating in a circle. ,
3 Monday morning rain began fall*
ing about 9 o'clock and continued
t with some interruptions until early
' Tuesday morning. It was not a
t beating, washing rain, but a quiet.
1 soaking one. Just what was needed.
It whuld be surplusage, absurdly
* jidiculous to say it was welcome and
e very much so. To put it conservatively,
this rain was worth thous~
ands of dollars to the country.
