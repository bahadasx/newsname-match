tion, as the result of a conference

Major General Funston's hands
and later brought personally to
Washington.
The information and reports of
the conference will be verbal, be
cause tho Administration wants
facts without .any reservation,
which such a record might entail.
In some quarters the border

than a desire to know the real
truth on economic and political
conditions in the interior.

aula will report to General Funston,
and at least one, probably Letcher,

While the military situation remained
encouraging, what Information the
State Department has obtained about
conditions within Mexico Is non0 too
favorable, officials privately admit,
Tho monetary situation, the renewed
activity of Zapatistas, the scarcity of
rood at certain points, the existence of
typhus at many cities and other facts

Department constitute tho basis for the
Administration's deslro for broader in

Announcement trrat the United
States Civil Service 'Retirement
Association will consider affiliation
with' the American Federation of
Labor .was the surprise of the
opening session of the annual con
vention of the association today.
This announcement was made to
delegates gathered in G. A. R. Hall
by Daniel Goldschmidt of New
York, president.
"I must call your attention to
the fact that we cannot induce tho
committee to report a retirement
bill, and the question arises:
What can we do to bring sufficient
influence to bear to bring about the
desired result?" he said.
"There is only one thing that I
know of, since it is impossible to
unite all the 400,000 civil service
employes into one 'compact body,
and that is to affiliate with the
American Federation of Labor."
INTERESTED IN SUGGESTION.
Tho suggestion created marked In

be tho big Issun at the afternoon ses

Ho recommended that tho association go

Llewellyn Jordan, secretary, reviewed
the work of the association for the past
year.
He scored employes of Waahlnctnn
departments for failure to co-operate In
me association s worn.
"It seems that tho rank and file of
mo civil service in the city of Washing
ton ran be awakened only when con
fronted with some real and threatened
danger to themselves and their per
sonal emoluments," he asserted.
"An Instance of this alarm was mani
fest by tho famous Borland rider which
contemplated the extension of tho
hours of labor with no provision for In
creased compensation or compensatory
allowance for such labor."
Dr. Jordan approved the Keating
measure 10 csiaonsn a civil service

Ho suggested that efforts be mndc to

Bill Appropriates Little for Civio
Improvements Beyond the

A RETRENCHMENT. MEASURE
Commissioners Jurned Down in
Several Important Recom
mendations, Report Shows.
The passing of the half-and-half
plan, which has applied to the fis
cal relations between the Federal
and District governments for near-4
ly forty years, was written into
prospective law today when the
District of Columbia appropriation
bill was reported to the House.
That bill, carrying approximate
ly $3,500,000 less than the amount
asked by the District Commission
ers, provides that hereafter Dis
trict revenue shall be exhausted
before the contribution of the Fed
eral Government to its Capital
City begins. This is in line with
the recommendations of the fiscal
inquiry' committee, which hcldfln
investigation last year.
The initial bill under the new
system strikes a hard blow at the
District. It is frankly admitted by
the House Committee on Appro
priations in its report that the Dis
trict is expected to furnish 69.3 per'
cent of the authorized expendi
tures for the next fiscal year, and
the Federal Government will con
tribute only 30.6 per cent (a frac
tion of 1 per cent .being unesti-
mated).
LITTLE FOR CiVIC BEAUTY.
Tho bill appropriates little for civic

requirements. There Is practically

Bernstorff Instructs Consuls to
Impress Citizens With Duties

SPECULATION IS AROUSED
Instructions Believed to Have
Come From Berlin Harm to
Cause Was Feared.
The first step in the new Ger
man campaign to stop lawlessness
by Germans in the United States
was' announced "by Ambassador
Bernstorff today. The embassy
made the following format state
ment: ,
"In consequence of cases that
have occurred of late, German
Ambassador Bernstorff sent in
structions to all the German
consuls in the United States to
strongly impress on German
citizens living in their districts
that it is their duty scrupulously
to obey the laws of the States
in which they reside."
Although von Bernstorff would
not have issued such instructions'
without direction from Berlin, it is
known, that he was instrumental in
showing the German foreign office
the wisdom of such a policy.
He has for some time argued
with Berlin officials that, notwith-'
standing Germany's offiotoydis
claimer of responsibility for uer'
man violations of American laws,
such independent acts wercdoing
the German cause , in.America a
great deal of hamf "anrJ that it
would be wise' for Germany to take
even more energetic steps to con
vince the United States that she
was in no way responsible .- what
had occurred.
