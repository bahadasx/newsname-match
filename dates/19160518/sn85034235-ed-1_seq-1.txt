CHAPTER XI.
I Little Protection For the
People.
T HAT sterling friend of the pop
ulace, that stalwart defender
of the rights and the morals
and the welfare and the purses
of his admiring constituents, that vo
clferous choice of the people. State
Senator Allerton, was discovered by
Sledge in the act of serving the public
interests by playing poker In the rooms
of Assemblyman Buckley, and with
these two conscientious patriots, deep
also In the exercise of their duties to
the commonwealth, were the very men
Sledge wanted to see—Franchise Wal
ters, who was heavy set. but not fat,
and who looked like a prosperous shoe
merchant, and old Pop Gresham, the
red eyed administration wheclliorse
from Pickerel county, and Calvin T.
Luther, the ministerial looking profan
ity expert, and Cap Digglesby. the
avowed and professedly bitter enemy
of Sledge, whose every white whisker
was needed as a calendar for his many
honorable scars of forensic battle.
It was Cap Digglesby who was the
first to hail the visitor as he entered
t lie door.
■'Hello, malefactor of great wealth,'
lie called. "Have you a spare queen of
clubs about your [>erson?''
"I'm shy on queens," confessed
Sledge, looking down with indifference
at the game lie played so indifferently
"Buckley, I'm dry."
"Beat you to it, old man," replied
Buckley easily. He was a spare person
with the neatly combed appearance of
a dancing master, but with intensely
clear eyes and deep creases in his
cheeks. "I sent word to the bar as soon
as the phone announced you. Your
stein will be right up."
"Thanks!" grunted Sledge, and con
siderately fell to estimating the jack
pot.
Allerton, a smooth featured man
with a good forehead and a smiling
eye, picked up tli<v two cards which
had * been dealt him, compared them
judieally with the three he held, fold
ed them together with minute care
and tucked them neatly under the
deck. Looking up, he caught the cold
ly disinterested eye of Sledge. Every
man of the six at the table bad tried
that same thing, but Allerton was the
only one who succeeded. Sledge, paus
ing to inspect carelessly the bountiful
ly arranged sideboard, moved into the
adjoining room. Allerton arose from
the table.
Deal me out for a couple of rounds,
he suggested. "Buckley, watch my
stack. There's twenty-three fifty in it,
and Pop Gresham's pile is mighty
low."
Pop Gresham took ten blues from
Allerton's assortment and added them
to his own.
Charge me ten from your friend';
treasury. Buckley," he chuckled, with
a playfulness intended to conceal his
real satisfaction.
"Well, what's new?" asked Allerton
closing the door carefully behind him
and sitting on the edge of Buckley
bed.
"Street car business," returned
Sledge.
"I see we have two companies down
home." remarked Allerton "Which
one are you in?"
"New one. Seven hundred and fifty
thousand." »
"Whew!" whistled Allerton. "Any
monev involved?"

"You must have a good outlook,"
wondered Allerton.
"Naw!" repudiated Sledge. "It's rot

"1 thought you held easily salable
ones, from what I saw in the papers,"
puzzled Allerton. "If you haven't,
however, you can easily get them from
the city council."
"They're no good," insisted Sledge.
"Short terms."
"That's right," agreed Allerton, be
ginning to see the light. "Franchises
in this state can be granted for twenty
ears and are renewable in ten year
periods at the option of the city coun
cil. I suppose your new franchises are
for twenty years."
"Uh-hunh!" assented S'.edge. "That's
hen the profits begirt!*'
"For both the company and its otD
il friends," smiled Alierton. "It's
rather a good provision as far as the
public is concerned, however. It gives
the people a voice."
Why?" demanded Sledge. "They
only ride."
'And pay." amended Allerton. "We
liked this over before at Waver's
house and at your ofiice. 1 think I
called attention to the fact that the
copie were beginning to expect a con
sideration for such valuable property
as franchises."
'They expect a private car for a
nickel." claimed Sledge. "We need
franchise legislation."
Its a dangerous thing to tackle,"
objected Allerton. "The voters are be
ginning to have Ideas about such
hings."
"That's why we have to work quick."
Sledge informed him.
"What do you want?" asked Allerton.
"Fifty year franchies— free."
"Good Lord!" exclaimed Alierton.
'Why, Sledge, the man who would pro
pose that might just as well retire from
politics forever."
"Sure!" agreed Sledge.
The senator stopped, with a shock,
and reflected.
"The street car interests in the state
are large, that's a fact." he acknowl
edged.
"Great game." approved Sledge. "I
want stock all over the state. You'd
"Great game." approved Sledge.
want stock all over the state. You'd
better invest."
"It might be attractive," considered
the senator. "How much stock do you
think i should secure?"
"Million."
Even the seasoned senator, used as
he was to private and personal discus
sious involving comfortable figures,
was startled at the sound of that word.
'That listens very cheerfully," he
conceded. "Do you suggest that I—buy
up—that amount of stock for myself in
the various street car companies of the
state or that myself and friends should
club together for that amount?"
"Hundred thousand extra for them,"
responded Sledge with the promptness
of a man who has done all his figuring
beforehand.
Yllerton spent some minutes in quiet
thought
"There's the legal business, too,"
Sledge reminded him.
"That's so." agreed Alierton. "An at
torney who is also a large stockholder
could control that clientage. Suppose I
see Buckley about this? Send him In.
will you?"
Appreciating the convenleuce of hav
ing no witnesses to conversations
which so Intimately concern the serv
ing of the public, Sledge loafed out
and stood nonchalantly over the table.
Tbe five men looked up at him keenly,
but Sledge was stariug into Cap Dig
glesby's band. Buckley finished bis
deal and glanced up again. He imme
diately arose.
"Take my hand, will you, Sledge?"
he begged, and be removed Sledge's
stein from the sideboard to the table.
Sledge sat down and fingered Buck
ley's chips while he drauk at his beer.
"Hope you break him," observed Cal
vin T. Luther as he presently dealt the
cards. "Buckley's too all fired lucky,
and I think he plays crooked myself."
"House committee!" yelled Franchise
Waiters. "That's unclublike language."
Sledge looked at his cards aud put in
chips and drew aud bet with the air of
a man who is confirmed in the opinion
that the general average will "get" a
square player in tbe end, no matter
bow he guards himself, and, since not
caring whether he won or lost Buck
ley's cliiiis. lie bet the same on a flush
as he did on a pair of deuces. He had
increased Buckley's stack slightly when
that gentleman returned- Sledge was
about to rise, but Buckley sat in Aller
ton's place instead.
"Keep your seat. Sledge," he observ
ed as lie nodded to Cap Digglesby,
Sledge's bitterest and most relentless
foe on the floor of the house of repre
sentatives.
"Yes, keep it five handed," urged
Digglesby. "I want to stretch my legs
a few minutes, and a four handed
poker game is about ns exciting as a
prayer meeting."
Digglesby walked around the room
two or three times and looked at the
patriotic pictures with which the walls
were pleutifully decorated for the ben
efit of Buckley's eamest constituents,
then he sauntered into the hall and
stretched his legs into the uext room,
where the senator, in deep thought,
«waited him.
Digglesby returned to the poker
game by ahd by. and as he sat down
smiled cheerfully at Buckley. Buckley,
who had been playing casino, seven-up
and pinochle with his poker cards and
making a mad havoc in Allerton's
chips in consequence, immediately
drew a pair to bis triplets and "bet his
head off" with keen zest.
Digglesby gave no sign or glance at
Sledge, but nevertheless, after an
other deal. Sledge arose stolidly from
the table, and. without making any
bones about it. walked directly into
the bedroom Alierton was loungin
in a cushioned window sill, smoking a
on
or
*9
Mgarette, and with his foot pushed the
big leather rocker around to a more
inviting position.
"The old veteran found a way." be
comfortably explained. "If wo at
tempted to railroad a bill empowering
the granting of fifty year franchises
without remuneration it would be
snowed under so quickly that the tell
er couldn't keep track of the votes.
There aren't ten men in the capitol
building who would dare go home to
their constituents if they supported
such a measure."
"Sure not," agreed Sledge. "Never
let anybody do anything in a law.
Keep 'em from it."
"That's the idea." assented Alierton
"Restrictive legislation. The people
are strong for that just now, anyhow.
Digglesby's idea is to call the act 'A
bill for the protection of municipalities
against the monopolistic perpetuity of
street car companies.' "
"Great!" approved Sledge. "It sounds
fierce if they get it. I don't myself,
but I know it's against the monopo
lies."
'It's almost harsh with them." dryly
commented Alierton. "The bill will
restrict the ear companies to a painful

degree. It will make a penal offense
on the part of the officers to bond
company for more than its capitalize
tion."
Sledge chuckled.
"The bankers' convention will in
dorse that," he said.
'The hill will prevent street railway
companies from running open or sum
mer ears when the thermometer is be
low 40 degrees F. It will prevent the
running of winter cars without double
glass protection for the motormen,
will be made illegal to have more than
one strap in every eighteen inches of
space. It will be made illegal for
full ear to run by a signaling pedes
trian, and it will be made illegal, al
though this will be scattered in three
or four places in the bill, and sur
rounded with a lot of ambiguous lan
gunge, for any franchise to be granted
for as long a period as fifty years.
"That's the talk." nodded Sledge.
"Restrictive legislation."
"I thought you could get along with
forty-nine years and eleven months,
stated Alierton. "Moreover, I think we
can frame the bill to protect the peo
ple."
"Can you slip it through?"
"Digglesby thinks so, although he
agrees with me that about six months
after it's done somebody will explain it
so that the voters will understand it,
aud the man who fathers it will have
his name chiseled alongside Benedict
Arnold's."
"He's dead," commented Sledge, with
keen philosophy.
"Exactly," coincided Alierton, with a
philosophy which, though unexpressed,
was still keener. "There's only one
political post of any worth which would
be open to him after the prejudiced
public had its erroneous judgment per
manently fixed."
'The senate," guessed Sledge.
•The United States senate," firmly re
peated Alierton, looking Sledge square
ly in the eye. "That's the one place
in which political opprobrium cannot
reach a man."
Sledge studied long and carefully and
made some painstaking readjustments.
In order to make a place for one man
he had to do considerable shifting on
his political chessboard and eventually
push a pawn off the edge.
I'll see what can be done about
that," he promised.
"That matter being clearly under
stood as well as the others we men
tioned—the legal representation and
the amount of stock 1 am to acquire—1
think the bill a feasible one and the
legislation to be exactly such as is
needed by the changing requirements
of our modern civilization."
"Applause." observed Sledge, devel
oping an unexpected turn for repartee.
"Will Digglesby fight the bill himself?"
"No; he'll put Bailey Cooper on the
job," grinned Alierton. "This will be
about the last time he can be used that
way too. That young spellbinder is
getting too wise. Digglosby's almost
afraid of him now."
"Can't we get him?" asked Sledge.
"No chance." regretted Alierton.
"He's too yonng yet"
"Don't risk him," warned Sledge.
"Leave it to Digglesby and Buck
lev." advised Allertou. "They know
Bailey like a book. They know what
he thinks when he locks himself In his
room, and he'll tear into this bill as if
be were fighting the devil himself, face
to face. After he gets througn the real
argument will begin, and anything any
body else says against it will sound
lbby. After that we'll bury the bill
committee until there's something
exeiling in the house, split in the fifty
ear franchise amendment and pass
the thing some rainy afternoon when
nobody's in the house but invited
friends."
"How long will it take?" inquired
Sledge.
"About as long as it will take you to
round up and organize the best paying
street car corporations in the state."
Sledge looked out of the window in
silence which seemed almost moody.
"So long," he said, and left by way
of the hall.
Meanwhile Bozzain and Timbers were
aviug their troubles. Two big, husky
men who looked as if they might be
primary leaders jostled them one day
and told them they had better leave
town. When they protested mildly the
huskies snarled and finally gave them

Great Place For Hunting.
The fauna of Uganda is probably
unequaled in variety and importance
In any other country in the world. On
the lakes are found a great number of
water birds, storks, cranes, herons,
flamingoes, geese, ducks and divers
But tiie finest are perhaps the huge
eagles, which prey on the fish, of
which there is a great variety. Hippo
potamuses and crocodiles bannt all the
waters in the country. On laud ele
phants are found in Buganda, Bunyo
ro. Buddu, Toro, Busoga, Elgon and
the Nile districts; buffaloes arc found
near the swamps; wild boors, hyenas,
leopards and wildcats infest the
woods, where smaller creatures, such
squirrels, gray parrots, monkeys
and guinea fowl, are found. In the
wild and more open country to the
north there are rhinoceroses, zebras, os
triches and many varieties of antelope,
and throughout the country vultures
and kites abound.

system. Is, according to a recent cal
dilation of W. F. A. Ellison. 49,000
times as bright ns the sun. y i3 134
times as large as the sun in diameter,
IS,000 times in surface aud 2,420,000
times in volume. Its distance from
us, according to the same estimate, is
4S9 light years. Suppose, says Mr.
Ellison, that instead of being at this
enormous distance it were placed in
the center of the solar system in lieu
the center of the solar system in lieu
of the suu. It would then occupy
eighty-five hundredths of the space ly

seen from the earth, would subtend an
angle of about seventy degrees of arc.
Thus, when its lower limb was on our
horizon, its upper would be within
twenty degrees of the zenith. Need

The Fame of Lens.
Lens leaped into fame in the seven

Years' war between France and Spain
Louis II. of Bourbon, known as the
Great Conde, achieved one of his
most notable victories when, on Aug.
20, 1648, he defeated the Archduke
Leopold. On that occasion the cele
brated Spanish infantry was complete
ly beaten. Condo was at that time
commander in chief of the French
forces, and Tureune was his subordi
nate. The battle began with a panic
In Conde's own regiment, but was re
trieved by his own coolness and brav
ery. In after years lie fought for the
Spanish against his own country,
where, however,, he ended his days in
peace, enjoying the society of Möllere

NATIVES OF ALASKA.
loth Classes of Them Seem to Be of
Asiatic Origin.
There are but two classes of na
tives in Alaska—Eskimos and Siwash
Indians. Eskimos live along the north
ern coast line, while the Siwash is
found in every part of Alaska.
The Eskimo is probably of Mon
golian extraction, and the Siwash cer
tainly is. In a mixed company of Si
wash Indians and Chinese coolies, all
dressed In similar garb, it would be
Impossible to distinguish one from the
other by physical appearance alone.
Likewise in speech the guttural tones
are Identical, and peculiarities of in
flection and the uneonscous little
mannerisms of orientals and Siwashes
are as strikingly similar as their phys
ical characteristics. The Siwash vo
cabulary contains between 200 and 300
words—some villages using more and
others fewer words, but all containing
some words of oriental origin.
The language of all Siwashes was
unquestionably the same originally,
although at present the inhabitants of
some villages are unable to under
stand the language spoken in others.
The speech of these natives on the
Aleutian islands probably shows the
widest divergence from the original
of all the various dialects.
Many Indians speak Russian, and
not a few speak the provincial idiom
called Chinook, common in British Co
lumbia. Washington and some other
states.
All these Indians had a common ori
gin, and that origin was in Asia be
fore the continents divided at Bering
strait. Siwashes frequently have red
hair, and bald heads are not uncom
mon. Not so of the true American
Indian. While Siwashes drifted far
southward, even into California, none
of them ever crossed tbe big barrier,
as they term the Rocky mountains.
In every way except in occupation
they are different from the Indians of
the states. The Siwash turns his at
tention to bunting and trapping from
necessity not from choice. He never
hunts for sport—only for meat.—New
York World.
HAZING AT WEST POINT.
A Sample of the Pranks the Cadets

From a West Point cadet's letter,
published in i860 in the South At
lantic Quarterly, we learn:
"General Seott has arrived. We will

limits so that any cadet found there
would be placed in arrest and treated
with the same severity which he
