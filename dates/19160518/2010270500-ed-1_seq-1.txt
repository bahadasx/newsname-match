Why? Well, we saw last Sunday

Resume of Wrk Done
By Co. Agent Beckhoff
The following report was made to
the board of directors of Dakota
County Farmers Association by
County Agent O. H. Beckhoff, at a
special meeting held here Friday.
In the calling of the meeting at
this time, I thought nothing would
put you and the people of the asso
ciation in closer touch with the
movements of the County Agent
than a brief review of the work car
ried on thus far this year.
I have in the past four months
met with, in a personal way, and
discussed farm problems with 212
farmers; have visited 228 farms,
and addressed seven meetings with
a total attendance of 281; have held
eight field meetings or demonstra
tions, with a total attendance of
1G3.
In the forepart of the season so
much unfavorable weather and such
a bad condition of roads obtained
that it was rather hard to get
around. Notwithstanding this, I
have been in every section of the
county, though the larger part of
the farmers have not been met per
sonally. . I have Baid at the outset, and still
believe, that the large office of the
County Agent is to serve the mass
of the neonle in an instructional
way, and to do this I have sought
the aid of the public press, news
notes, letters, public meetings, and
concrete field demonstrations of
things which 1 thought were most
needed. These demonstrations serve
only to demonstrate the things
which we preach. These demonstra
tions are the proofs that the tilings
we seek to bring you are principles
which have been carefully worked
out and are known to be of value.
Because I believe you are ready to
appreciate these things very readily.
and because I thought I could be of
greater service in u propaganda
way, I have only started enough of
these demonstrations to convince
the skeptical, and have so located
them in various parts of the county
that no one will have to go very far
to get in direct touch with demon
stiation work.
SOME OF THE WORK
We have found that the treat
ment of oat seed with formalin is
very effective in the control of smut.
With this principle in mind I have
sought in every way possible to
bring this fact home to the farmers.
Besides using the telephone, the
newspapers, the personal and circu
lar letter, and the meeting, I have
held several field demonstrations at
which the method was explained in
detail. From the data which I have
been able to gather I should judge
that fully 15 of peoplo growing
oats, treated their seed.
In the treatment of potatoes, very
much the same method was used,
except that demonstrations in the
use of corrossive sublimate was lim
ited to eight fields. These eight
demonstrations should prove quite
fully the efficacy of the treatment.
Eipl.t lemonstrations have been
condr.f j in the pruning of fruit
trees, mi.j fivo more will be conduct
ed this summer in the application of
spray mixtures.
Not being fully conversant with
situation here, I have done what I
could to aid in the improvement of
the seed corn situation, and have se
cured for parties seed corn to the
extent of over three hundred bush
els; of alfalfa seed to the extent of
twenty-eight bushels, nnd of other
seeds to the total of forty-eight
dollars.
In the farm management survey
project I have secured records on
twenty-four farms and started farm
record books on fifty-six.
I have surveyed three farms on
drainage, to demonstrate that in
some sections land can bo profitably
improved in that way.
While Borne things may not be
strictly demonstrational in their na
ture, I shall always be glad to, in so
far as possible, further the interests
of any public spirited enterprise.
I this connection I might say that
we have secured the assurance that
we will have the assistance of a fed
eral expert to advise with the au
thorities here, in the construction
and improvement of country roads.
This expert oomes from the Division
of Public Highways, Washington, D.
C, at no cost to the county here.
Prof. L. W. Chase, of the Engi
neering Department of the Nebras
ka Experiment Station, has been up
here to confer with authorites on
this question, and is at present in
Washington in the interests of this
movement. It is not the hope to in
crease the expenditures but to put
them to the very best use.
We have plans begun for the or
ganization of one rural community
for the supplying of homes with
electricity.
These few foregoing remarks show
some of the major lines of work fol
lowed. I have tried to eliminate
the personal work, in an effort to
carry it out to greater numbers in a
community way.
I hope to make the work stand on
its own merits, and I believe it will,
and bdforo undertaking new lines,

Lutheran Church Notes
DAKOTA CITY-SALEM
The pastor would like to enlist the
aid of the people in keeping posted
us to the sick so he can visit them.
The persons in whose home there
arc sick are the ones who should be
the first to inform him. The physi
cian is called early, but tho pastor
is so often left without information.
He would appreciate this informa
tion. Team work is the things that
count in the lives of most of us.
Occasionally there" is a star perform
er, not often. We are all happier
and better satisfied when we work
together. If wo remember tho little
things and do them, the larger
things will take care of themselves.
Immanuel's election, last Sunday
evening resulted in the election of
Mr. A. T. Haase, elder, and Mrs.
Paul Kinklc, deacon, each for itwo
years. Salem's election was not
held, since the rain kept all but four
men, one woman, and four children
home. The election will bo held
next Sunday morning, if nothing
hinders. Congregational meetings
are worthy of your attendance, and
your privilege to take part m them.
It is your meeting. ,
You wish to get the most good
from the church. This is right.
We get it by attending on the church
worship. The church is not the
place for sinless men heaven is the
place for the perfect but it is tho
place for men who wish to live bet
ter lives by the fear of God.
Tho conference at Wayne was, the
best attended for several years. All
of the men, save one, were there
and each paper read showed careful
preparation. The Womans Home
and Foreign Missionary Soc ty had
an anexcellent program. .irsday
evening the conference wr motored
out to the State Normal, , mre they
visited tho buildings. They wore
conducted about by one of the in
structors of the institution.
