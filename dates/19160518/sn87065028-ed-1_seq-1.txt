WELL KNOWN COLUMBIAN
PASSES AWAY AT FORT
BLISS, N. M.
WENT THERE IN .
SEARCH OF-HEALTH
Body Will Be Interred Here,
Date of Funeral Not Yet
Decided Upon.
Mr. John R. Maxwell, a well
known citizen of Columbus, died at
noon Wednesday, his death having
occurred at Fort Bliss, New Mexico,
whither he went several weeks ago
in the hope that the recuperative
powers of the climate would prove
beneficial to his health, which for
quite a long time past has been any
thing but good. The hope proved a
t vain one, however, for instead of
improving he steadily declined and
finally succumbed to his illness,
which embraced a complication of
ailments. '
News of Mr. Maxwell's death was
by no means a surprise to relatives
and friends here, as on Tuesday his
wife received a telegram stating
that he was sinking rapidly and re
questing that she hasten to his bed
side. Mrs. Maxwell and her brother,
- Mr. George Y. Banks, left immed
iately for Fort Bliss, but were too
late to witness the final dissolution,
Mr. Maxwell having died white they
were en route to the western city.
Mr. Maxwell, who at the time of
his death was 48 years old, was a
native of Columbus and was prom
; inent in local busintss and social
circles, having for several years
been president of the Columbus Ma
chine and Foundry Company. He
was a veteran of the Spanish-Amer-
- ican war and evinced a keen inter-
ters, having been an active member
of Columbus Lodge No. 655, B. P.
O. E. He is survived by his widow,
a daughter, -Miss Lucy" Maxwell,
his mother, Mrs. Lillie Maxwell, and
three aunts, Mrs. A. B. Jones, of
Vicksburg, Mrs. S. C. Tomlin of
Statesville, N. C, and Mrs. Gregory,
of the same city.
The body will be brought to Co
lumbus for interment, but it is not
known when it will arrive and ar
rangements for the funeral have
, not been announced.

the Turks from the Rowanduz re
jrion is continuing its progress west

On the p-eater portion of the line
in Belgium and France, the artillery
of both sides continues active"; being
especially vigorous in Belgium in
the vicinity of Dixmude and St
Georges, and'in France around the
Avocourt Wood, Hill 304 and Le
Mort Homme, northwest of Verdun

WANDERING INDIANS HAVE A
NUMBER OF CHILDREN, BUT
NOT RIGHT ONE.
A party of nomads numbering be
tween 35 and 40 men, women and
children arrived here late Tuesday
j afternoon, and camped for the
night on the bank of the Tombiubee
river, just west of the city. They
took their departure Wednesday af
ternoon, having stated that it was
their intention to return to Florida
via Birmingham, which is the next
large city n their route.
Press dispatches sent out some
time ago stated that a party of
Gypsies was traveling through this
section having in their possession a
young boy who had been kidnapped
from the home of wealthy parents
in the east, and - soon after the
nomads arrived Chief of Police
Morton went fo their camp to make
an investigation. He found a lad
about 12 years old who looked like
he was a member of the Caucassian (
race, but as one of the men, who
.-rated that he was an Indian, claim-
ed him as his son, and the lad had

ACTION IN CONGRESS DESIGN
TO START COURT MACHIN
ERY. Washington, May 17. Growing
south have the idea tnaf fhere is a
chance for these claims to be met
soon. Representatives from Louis-
iana and Mississippi and from all the
cotton growing states are receiving
many letters from those interested
in claims.
The truth of the matter is that
many yenrs will pass before any
action in this matter, which involves
$G8,000,000, may be expected. Mr.
Clark's bill simply testa the validi-
ty of the tax, which was levied on
the owners of cotton during the
war. lie proposes that a test case
be preferred to the court of claims
and be rushed through as quickly as
practicable so that the question
may go to the supreme court for
decision. , Mr. F. C. Owen acted as secretary.
A long time ago the supreme Among other matters a resolution

claims, but no record of the case-or Wilson, and all delegates were in

that it remains undecided so fur as ,
the records show. In 1867 a test
case was lost in the lower court and
later, upon tippeal to the supreme
court, eight justices heard the case, '
four affirming the decision of the,
lower court and four deciding in

but the opinion of the four justices
who upheld the constitutionality ofj

Result Boncfici.illy to Both
Conferences.
Saratoga Springs, N. Y., May 17.
The unification of the Methodist
Episcopal Chinch and the MethrdUt
Episcopal Church, South, was en
dorsed almost unanimously by the
Methodist (ieneral Conference o:
Tuesday.
The confemee ndoped the report
of the committee on unification,
.which provides for further negotia
tions with the Southern church, pav
ing the way for final action by the
general conference of the Southern
chunh in 1 y 1 8 and the Northern
ehunh's general conference in 1920.
The report recommends the amal
gamation of the branches of Ameri
can Methodism with the general
confrence as the supreme govern
ing body of the church, and with
reparate conferences anil Episcopal
supervision for the negro churches.
Th report was adopted amid
i cents of unbounded enthusiasm.
Only one npeech was made in favor
of action and none in opposition.
Rev. John F. Goucher, president
emeritus of Goucher College, Balti
more, Md., in moving adoption said
the proposed amalgamation would
be a federated union that would
protect all of the varied interests.
He explained that the interests of
the regroes would be protected and
they would also have opportunity to
?ole their own problems.
When Dr. Gouoher concluded the
pent-up enthusiasm of the confer
ence burst it bounds, everyone rose
to his feet, and the building shook
with applause and shouts of "Vote,
vote."
iicnewed cheer ng greeted the
announcement t,hat the report had
been adopted, and as Bishop E. R.
Hentirix, of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, South, stepped to the speak
er's desk und clasped hands with
Bishop Cranston, the presiding offi
cer, the convention spontaneously
began singing, "IVaise God From
Whom all Blessing3 Flow," and fol
lowed with "Blest Be the Tie that
Binds."
Bishop Cranston was greatly af
fected by the demonstration. Wip
ing away the tears that streamed
down his face, he said:
"This is the supreme moment of
my life. You might have continued
me in an effective relation eight
years longer if you had so willed,
but you could not tdve me the grati
fication of soul I feel today."
Bishop Uendrix said: "As senior
bishop of American Methodism I
believe that by your action today
we have accomplished more for the
good of mankind than resulted from
the battle of Saratoga."
Civic League to Meet.
An important meeting of the
members of the Ladies' Civic League
will be held .next Friday afternoon
at 4 o'clock at the Chamber of
