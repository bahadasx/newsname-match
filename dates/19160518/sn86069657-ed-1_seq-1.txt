Education Board
Makes Statement
In discussing the actions of this
Board in changing the boundaries and
putting the Wultersvilleand Dsrlings
villo schools two second-class schools
together and making one pn( flrgf-i-lnsa
nhnrf it has been said that it
was rushed through wihout one of tho
members being present and that the
other three were misinformed, Ac, c.
Wo wish to state for the benefit and
information of those who want to know
tho truth of this matter, that the
change in these two districts was first
discussed at the time we abolished the
Coperas Creek district, which school
until one year ago, was being main
tained by this county for the benetit
and convenience of Clark and Mont
gomery citizens exclusively, except
two families who lived in Powell who
had children within the school age.
Those people objected seriously when
we abolished that district. They did
not abuse the Board of Education and
every one connected in any way with
the school affairs of the county, but
they protested severely. They were
conscientious, sincere parents who saw
that their children attended school,
but were afraid tliut if the district was
abolished neither county would be able
to have them as convenient to the
schools, on account of their unfortu
nate location with reference to other
schools, us is the Case in inunj in
stances in most every count , auu it
'we hud listened to their pleadings we
Would still be maintaining that school.
This Hoard appointed two members
to go into the territory of Wultersvilie
and Darliugsville, una they went iu
persuii' and looked, over the ttiuation,

iieur ine center oi eitiier uistnct, not
alirst-cluss'schooi'in that division, the
Hiuootiiest part of the count)', both
buildings in, need of repairs, and know
ing that in u large school it requires
teachers with iirst-cfuss ccrtiticutei,
the pupils, teachers, patrons all mani
fest greater interest and tor various
reasons pertaining to the welfare of
the people who live in that section and
ulso the taxpayers all over the county,
wo decided to (Uniterm ti the lint- I'V
jiiK these two iiHtrii-ty.
It is perfectly natural for people who
send then children to school to want a
school convenient, out a io impossible
to gel it near evury one. Our legisla
ture had lino in mind when it passed
the law giving the County Board of
Education Fl'U, power to establish
rjeAv ilNtphs or to change the bound
aries of tnose already established. We
havci establisheu a Fm-elnss school in
that district mid the people should be
proud or it. While it is not the larg
est school in the count) cither in num
ber uf pupils or size of territory, still
it is the first time that the.Firbt Divis
ion ever had a first-clas district that
demanded the bcrvicesol a first clas
teacher, and we ure sure that they will
be pleased with tue change after they
have seen the advantages that it will
afford.
It is true that one member of the
Itnipl wnt utisenr- having been called
uway on account of the illness of his
grandson, but he knew ttiut this mut
ter wus coming up and wrote the
Chairman of the Board that he could
not be present out would be satisfied
with whatever action tue other mem
bers took, and after he knew what ac
tion had been tuken he concurred In
thu decision of the other three. When
the petition was placed with tho'Chuir
ifiau asking for u specful meeting to re
consider the matter, stating their rea
sons, the members uf tho Board were
asked if they wanted the cull inude and
they stated thut they did not us It
would Jut cost $ILM0 to havo thu ex
tra meeting, when it could be taken
up at their next regular meetlug, and
that they had welged thu matter well
before taking the action, had heard the
reasons as set forth In tho petition, and
that they would (tot reconsider the
the action It called.,
School Patrons
Hold Meeting
A number of citizens of both
the Waltereville and Darlingsville
schools, tho two schools recently
consolidated, and the two largest
schools in this division, met at
the Wultersvilie school house
lust night to talk over the ques
tion of taking legal steps to annul
the consolidation of these schools,
which these citizens claim was
effected without, giving anv re
gards to the wishes of the school
patrons. They resolved them
selves into u mass meeting. J.
M. Smothers was elected Chair-"
man und J. N. Burgher was
elected Secretary. The following
resolutions were presented nnd
utmniiuonsly udopted :
KES0M7TI0XS.
We, the patrons, citizens and tax
payers of W'altcrsville and Darlings
ville school districts, being apprised of
the fact that the County Board of Ed
ucation 1ms consolidated the two dis
tricts here represented, without coun
sel of the putrons, aud, upon petition
lor a rehearing that we mar nresent
our objections to the consolidation, we
are arroguntly, insolently and despot
ically wholl ignored, come together
in muss meeting for the purpose of de
nouncing such autocratic government
of our schools.
Wo resolve that in this consolidation
it is the sense of those attending this
meeting; that no reference was, given
to tke. needs of our children, but tha,t
v (Conlinued on Last tagej.
v This Board has, at all times used it
best jtiugeiiiriii iu administering the
the school affairs oftheeouutj. We
do not claim not to- have made any
mistakes. The man who never mnLi-s
a mistake is tho man who does nothing.
but we have always managed to reach
a unanimous opinion upon all questions
and it has never been necessary to call
on our Chairman, Mrs. Ilohannun, to
vote upon any question pertaining to
the expenditures or changes of any
boundaries in the county ; hence, wv
alone aro responsible and aro perfectly
willing to allow the public to judge at
to tho wisdom of our acts und we fail
to find any trustee in the county who
thinks that our schools are not pro
gressing in their respective districts
and we feel thut they are the ones
most capable of Judging.
Jlelow will show what two out. ol
tho thirty trustees, who have express
ed themselves to us have to say, anil
the others just as favorable.
