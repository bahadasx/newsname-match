and amounts to pay the interest a

The other paragraph is the
"That all laws and parts of laws
sistent with this act are repealed."
District Share, 69.3 Per Cent.
In place of a bill modeled on th<
half-and-hal/ plan a measure is offered
to the House in which the District
of Columbia pays for the support
of the National Capital In the proportion
of 63.3 plus and the United States
pays 30.6 plus, and a condition is created
whereby the United States could
legally abandon the city of Washing
xon entirely.
The bill carries millions less thar
the Commissioners asked for. The needi
of the District as outlined'by them to
taled $15,182,196.34. However, all ex
lsting activities have been covered ir
the bill as reported to the House, anc
provision is made for starting severa
new and interesting projects. Conspicuous
by its absence, however, is
the authorization to change the site
of the municipal hospital to an uppei
14th street locality. There is no mention
of this in the bill anywhere, anc
it is quite probable that the agitatior
on this proposed change is responsible
(or the non-appearance of the item ir
the bill. No provisions for new park;
appear. An extraordinarily large nutn
ber of new salaries are to be found ir
the bill, 144 more than those providec
for ir? the i-iirrpnt art and a r* jinucii
ally large number of salary increase!
have been placed in the measure.
Recommendations Are Ignored.
Scarcely any of the Commissioners
numerous legislative recommendation:
have found a way into the appropria
tson bill. The proposal to place th?
Aqueduct bridge under the Commis
sioner?, instead of^ the War l>epart
inent. was r.ot provided for, but in it:
place legislation Is offered to provide
tha* the upkeep of the Aqueduct bridg<
and the filtration plant shall be pan
for hereafter entirely from the reve
nues of the water department. Sep
arate appropriations have been use<
for thi3 upkeep heretofore.
One of the most important provision
of the bill Is the legislation providinj
for the plan to effect a connection be
tween the sewage system of the Dis
trict with systems in Maryland. Thi
plan, on which Asa E. Phillips, super
intendent of sewers of the District o
Columbia, has worked for many year?
is designed to prevent Maryland town
from using Rock creek and othei
streams as sewers, thus giving Wash
ington the had end of the bargain. Th
Maryland legislature has taken appro
to >ate action, and the authorities nov
will be in a position to work out plan
whereby the Maryland system can b
hitched up to the District system an<
insure pure streams, otherwise Mary
land might. dump sewage into Hoc]
creek or the Potomac, and the District'
expensive system for keeping thes
streams clean within Its own border
would go for naught.
Summer Camp for Cadets.
A camp for summer instruction of th
High School Cadets is provided foi
with an appropriation of $3,000 for ex
pcrises, and authority for using Wa
Department equipage.
A seven - hundred - thousand - dolla
eastern high school Is started by a
initial appropriation.
The Columbia Hospital for Women i

tnent.
A reformatory for long-term prison
ers is authorized to be built at Occo

thorized to transfer to it prisoner
originally sentenced from the Distric

legislative bill, that the gas coinpanie
shall charge the District only 70 cent
for gas is found in the District bill.

Reductions in Estimates.
The principal reductions making the
I difference between tlie bill as reported
. and the estimates of the Commissioners
are to be found in the failure to
provide for the purchase of the Patter1

s J $625,000; the failure to provide for the
"{proposed municipal garbage collection
"|and disposal plant, $300,000; the mu- 1
'jnicipal hospital, unprovided, $150,000.
l|The total school appropriation is low,
'j there being $535,000 difference between
-,the buildings and grounds estimates

REPUBLICANS PLAN
POLITICAL "DRIVE"
Campaign Will Be the Most
Elaborate Since That
of 1896.
PROGRESSIVES TO HAVE
HAND IN MANAGEMENT
Special Attention Will Be Paid to
Senatorial Elections and to
Publicity Work.
?
Preparations for a national political
campaign on a scale to surpass^ even
the memorable campaign of 1896 are
under way by the managers of the republican
party. Expansion of committees.
creation of additional committees,
elaboration of organization and new
features of effort in various directions
will go to make up a political "drive"
this fall of unexampled vigor, system j
and thoroughness. The plans include:
1. As one new feature, the creation
of a special committee composed of
members of the national committee,
and senators not members of that committee,
which will pay special attention
to the senatorial contests in states
where the republicans hope to win.
~ * - - ' ??nonDintl
Z. AS anoiner new r-iuuic,
of the congressional campaign committee
organization through the appointment
of seven subcommittees, comprising
practically the entire membership
of that committee and putting every
man to work to help carry the House
of Representatives.
Progressives to Take a Hand,
j 3. A similar disposition of forces In
the national committee and strengthening
that organization, giving the proj
gressives a hand in the management
of the campaign if reunion is effected
I at Chicago.
1 4. Utilization to the utmost of Jonathan
Bourne's Half-million-dollar Republican
Publicity Association, which
I has been at work for more than a
year, and which has already collected
I campaign contributions known to run
| into large figures.
The formation of a senatorial campaign
committee is a distinct departure.
! designed to look after the interests of
senatorial candidacies as the congressional
committee looks after nominations
for the HoVtse. The idea originated
with republican senators, and the
details will be worked out at Chicago
after the reorganization of the national
committee.
After the elections of 1914 the republicans
found to their chagrin that in
at least two states a reasonable amount
of effort might have elected republican
senators. At the time it was "everybody's
business" to watch the campaign,
which, of course, resulted in it
being nobody's business and the democrats
walked away with the prizes
practically by default, It is claimed.
Congressional Committee Expanded.
The republican national congressional
campaign committee has already expanded
and completed its reorganiza- .
tion upon a larger scale than ever be- j
fore known, and will wage the most
vigorous campaign since the hot fllhts
| of 1898 and 1900. The executive committee
has been expanded from nine
i members to seventeen and endowed
with wider authority. Representative
William B. McKinley of Illinois has
been chosen chairman of the executive
[committee, with Representative Tilson
of Connecticut vice chairman. Representative
Milier of Delaware secretary
i and former Senator Nathan B. Scott,
(now a resident of this city, treasurer.
A subcommittee on ways and means
has been appointed, of which Representative
Esch of Wisconsin Is chairman.
There is a subcommittee on organization,
Representative Halvor
S^eenerson. chairman; a subcommittee
on auditing. Representative Mondell,
chairman; a subcommittee on finance.
Representative Austin of Tennessee,
chairman; a subcommittee on literature,
Representative Kahri of California,
chairman; ori publicity. Representative
Fess of Ohio, chairman; on speakers,
with Representative Slemp of Virginia.
chairman, and on law, with Rep
i rvBcnidiive yjiixunm ui rcnnsyIvailia,
I chairman. W. Tyler Pa pre of Maryland
is assistant secretary of the executive
committee.
Representative Woods of Iowa is
chairman and John C. Eversman secretary
of the full committee.
The congressional committee will
maintain headquarters in Chicago during
the convention, and thereafter will
open headquarters In New York ami
Chicago. The committee Is highly confident
TTf carrying the House in November,
but wants to make the majority
as sweeping as possible, and to that
end will, as stated, conduct probably
the most extensive congressional campaign
waged for many years.
Question of an Advertiser
Answered.
An advertiser particularly interested
in tlie Northeast has
asked about the relative circulation
of" the different Sunday
newspapers in that section of
the city. '
In the recent te?t r^nctic <-??.
of 116 homes visited where Sunday
newspapers were read, on
ten different blocks scattered
throughout the Northeast section,
92 families read The Sunday
Star, 45 read the Sunday
Post, 33 read the Sunday Times
and 31 read the Sunday Herald.
This test census fairly indicates
that in the homes in the
Northeast section of the city
The Sunday Star has double
the circulation of the Sunday
Post, and has about three'times
as many reader^ as cither of
the one-cent Sunday newspapers.
If you live in the Northeast
and you arc not reading The
Sunday Star you arc missing
the best Sunday newspaper in
Washingtorfand the most popular
every section.

Washington Takes Confederate
Reunion From Tulsa,

WITH THE OLDER BODY
Under Sky Gray as Their Uniforms,
Old Soldiers Close Birmingham
Gathering With Parade.
BIRMINGHAM. Ala.. May IK.?The
desire of the old Confederate soldiers ,
to parade down Pennsylvania avenue ,
and be reviewed by the President of
the United States led them to choose ,
Washington, D. C., for the 1917 re- <
union city at the closing business session
of their reunion here last night. |
Tulsa. Okla., and Memphis, Tenn., received
the next highest votes, in the
order named.
Washington's claims for the honor
of entertaining the "boys in gray"
next year were presented by Col. Hilary
A. Herbert, Secretary of the Navy
in the cabinet of the iate President
Cleveland. In an eloquent speech Mr.
Herbert pointed to the historic features
surrounding such an invasion or
the capital of the country with a message
of peace at a time when the international
relations of the nation are
strained to a high tension.
The movement, he said, was started ?
by Hancock Corps of the Grand Army ,
of the Republic, which desired that the
old soldiers in gray be accorded the
same privileges and pleasures in their i
National Capital as had the soldiers in ,
blue.
Others Supporting Washington.
Gen. C. W. Hooker of Alabama. Gen.
A. J. West of Georgia and Mrs. Cornelia
Branch Stone of Galveston, Tex.,
supported Washington's claims in
short speeches.
Gen. A. B. Booth of Louisiana insisted
that the next reunion go to a
southern city. He injected the negro
question into the discussion for the
; first time, declaring that the lack of
segregation laws would force southern
women, as well as southern men, to mix
with negroes promiscously in street
cars and other public places.
J. P. Norfleet, former commander-inchief
-of the Sons- of Veterans, and Mrs.
J. T. Latham made enthusiastic speeches
In favor of Memphis, while the
claims of Tulsa, the other contestant,
were voiced by Tate Brady of Tulsa
and William D. Matthews of Oklahoma
City.
Sons to Merge With Veterans.
The recommendations of the resolutions
committee, with the exception of
one favoring a reduction in the salary of
the adjutant general from $1,800 to 1
$1,500 annually and another favoring
the consolidation of the veterans and j
Sons of Veterans' organizations, were
referred to the commanding general
and the heads of the three departments.
The resolution favoring the
consolidation of the two organizations i
was adopted, and a committee com- ;
nnaorl (if t ho p-pnoml nfflrprsi anH nno
representative from each division was
appointed to co-operate with a similar 1
committee from.the Sons, to report at 1
the next reunion. -t
The effort to reduce the adjutant 5
general's salary failed when it was e
learned that the constitution leaves
that matter in the hands of the executive
council and commander-in-chief. 1
At the election of officers late in the 1
I afternoon Gen. George P. Harrison. 1
commander of the Alabama division of <
the United Confederate Veterans, was
selected commander-in-chief of the vet- 1
erans, succeeding Gen. Bennett Young i
of Louisville, Ky.. who refused to per- 1

didate for re-election. Other officers 1
named were: <

A sky as gray as the uniforms they
were greeted the veterans today when J
they prepared for the grand parade, the 0
closing feature of the reunion.
The gayety of the grand reunion ball
was marred last night by the death of
John A. McKev. seventy-five years old. 11
of Birmingham. He expired oil the ballroom
floor just after telling a party of a
young people that when he died he e
"would like to go amid a scene of such b
happiness." The body was removed ^
quickly and comparatively few of the
dancers knew of the occurrence.
Birmingham's resolution to care for
old veterans first has resulted in fewaccidents
and cases of illness. Plenty
of cots were furnished in the downtown <>
buildings and at the camp at the fair r*
grounds. 5,
At the latter place the soldiers were J*
placed in the buildings and more than
4,500 men were cared for. ^

William A. Mearns Tells of Bank's
First Connection With Lewis
Johnson & Co.
Trial of the Iliggs National Bank
case, in which Charles C. Glover, piesilent;
W. J. Flather, vice president, and
Henry H. Flather, former cashier, are
charged with perjury, continued in
Criminal Court No. 1 today, the chief
feature of the earlier session of the dav
being permission obtained by the government
to recall to the witness stand
W. Morris Laniinond.
Notwithstanding the fact that Lammond
had been cross-examined and excused
from the witness stand yesterday,
and that vigorous objections were
made today by Attorney Hogan. for
the defense, against recalling him. Justice
Siddons ruled that the government
could again place Lammond on the
stand.
Mr. Hogan said: "The defendants
contend that your honor has not exet
cised the judicial discretion disposed
in you. but your honor has. in the language
of the court, abused this discretion."
Defense Notes an Exception.
Mr. Hogan said that there is a general
ule and established practice which, if
)bserved, would have prevented the rerail
to the stand of Mr. Lammond after
lis cross examination, and the defense
noted an exception.
In his ruling Justice Siddons said:
"Of course the purpose of the court
s to have elicited t he truth of t he
harge that has been made against
hese three defendants. 1 think counsel
for the defense has correctly stat;d
the general practice that prevails
n the great majority of cases. The
:ourt is aware that there are cases of
complicated character and nature, consisting,
it may be, of several branches,
ind for the purpose, of getting at the
ruth and presenting the matter so that
he jury may judge of the facts in the
;ase that practice will be observed
which is best calculated to accomplish
the end in view."
At another point in his ruling Justice
Siddons said :
"The court does not conceive that any
injury will be suffered by the defendants
in this case because the witness is recalled
to the stand to testify to another
branch of the case."
"There are exceptions to the*rule in
some cases where the interest of justice
seems to demand at, the court insisted
Asked to Identify Documents.
Lammond was asked to identify documents
relating to transactions in stocks
ind bonds by Lewis Johnson & Co.. for
ivhich firm he was a bookkeeper, many of
which transactions the government claims
:o have been made by the bank for itself,
ilthough the defense is that these transactions
were made for the bank's customers.
The defense endeavored to expedite
the trial by conceding many of these ?
transactions, waiving the necessity of
documentary proof. It was said that,
the defense hoped by its expedition to
obtain an acquittal by June 27, on
which day the charter of the Kiggs
National Bank will expire, so that when
? /,,,Ae?iAn t~,f tlm ronpwal fif ths ch;<r
ler comes before the controller of the
currency he may not be able to refuse '
to grant a renewal on the ground that
officers of the bank are under indictnent.
Up to noon yesterday thirteen of
the transactions had been identified
*nd there was a report in the courtoom
today that the government intends
to trace through eighty-seven
nore such transactions.
There are 93" transactions in the govrnment'8

Established Bank Connection.
In the direct examination of Wiliam
A. Mearns this morning, he testied
that Lewis Johnson A- Go. had had
n opportunity to take over the brokerage
business of the Washington
ranch of the New York firm of Post
: Flagg, when this firm, he said, deided
to give up the Washington btisiflw
This? firm, he said, had been e.ve
uting brokerage orders for Riggs
ank officials and Lewis Johnson & Co.
ad not been. .
Mearns said he went to see Mr.
-lover and asked the latter could Lewis
ohnson & Co. have the business. Tim
ank was lending money to Post ?
lagg, he said, and he inquired could
,ewis Johnson a- Co. have such acDmmodation.
The witness testified
[r. Glover told him that because of
le fear of panic conditions?this was
1 1907?it was a bad time to enter
pon new business arrangements, but
lat if Mearns and his partners thought
all right to go ahead, if their collatral
was all it should be and if Post &
lagg took up their loans, probably an
rrangement could be made. Mearns
^stifled that the relation of borrower
y Lewis Johnson & Co. ensued with
?e bank and that his firm took over
ie Post & Flagg business. The firm
as then at 1319 F street northwest
id afterward moved to Pennsylvania
tenue next door to the hank.
Question of Bank Balance.
Continuing, the witness declared that
jome one" in the bank suggested that
ie late Pitt Cooke should be brought
to the Johnson firm with his business,
sked "what was said about your bank
ilances -at the Riggs in connection
ith stock transactions?" the witness
.id: "'Will' Flather said our balance
as not as big as it ought to be." He
lid Mr. Flather told him that their
isiness amounted, so far. to commisons
of $2,000, which would be 5 per
nt of a suitable balance of $40,000.
ie witness characterized that as "a
irfectly good banking argument." He
id he had informed Mr. Flather that
e Johnson firm had not. however,
ade much out of the $2,000 in commisons.

The question of the telephonic consctian
between the bank and the
okerage office was then gone into,
