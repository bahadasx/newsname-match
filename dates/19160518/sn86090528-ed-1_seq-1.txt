BIG BENEFIT
TO WHEAT
The gentle nhowcr which continued
' for several hours Wednesday night
made a noise like sweet music to the
wheat growers of Grady county and.
according to reports, it added a neat
sum to the probable amount of rev-
! enue that will be derived from the
1 small grain crop.
! In some localities the wheat had
I heguii to suffer from lack oj moisture.
It is' said, and the shower came just
In time to save it. While reports con
cerning the condition of the crop vary
widely, the concensus of opinion seems
be that a fair yield may be expect
ed. with favorable weather from now
til harvest is completed. The rain
last nignt totaled nearly half an inch.
BOOTLEGGERS SCRAPPING;

Down at Wirt, over in Carter coun

began a war on prices, cutting beer

COFFMAN
STIRRED BY
SPEEDERS
Hangs Fine cn Car Driver and Hints that
Something Mere is About to Happen;
Committee Favorable to
Motorcycle Cry
Judging from the manner in which
things are shaping something is about
to drop in the "spoeding" line within
a very short time. Yesterday morn
ing Mayor Coffman hung a. fine of $5
on tho driver of, one of the many ser
vice cars, and registered the regiark
that business was going to pick up in
the service car line, and all other
speeding lines, unless somo one
chanced to take a tumble to the way
matters stand.
Mayor Coffman stated yesterday!
afternoon, in speaking of the matter,
that the. speed ordinances were un- j
doubtedly being regarded as a joke I
by auto drivers and unless the police
and the mayor himself should get j
busy right now, some deplorable acci-1
dent would happen before many days
Police officers state that
there is
scarcely a driver of any kind of a mo
tor car in Chickasha who pays the
slightest attention to the stops, re
quired by ordinance, at the intersec
tions of Ninth street an'd Kansas and
Minnesota avenues.
Further, the police are said to state
that one would not have to look very
far or hard to find autos which are
driven at any and all hours of the day
and night at the speed of from forty
miles per hour up to fifty and sixty
miles. ,
Councilman Neal. chairman of the
police committee, stated that the com
mittee was considering the matter of
the employment of a motorcycle cop,
whose duty it should be to hold cases
on all speeders and jay drivers, to file
complaint against such and to run
them down, arrest and brin them in.!
to court w henever and w herever j
caught with the goods.
Mr. Neal stated that itwas possible
the committee would make its report
to the council at tho next regular
meeting, recommending the employ
ment of a regular motorcycle cop.
In referring to this matter, Mayor
Coffman stated he was in favor of it.
Ho said that should the city employ
a temporary officer, or a special offi
cer ty serve for a short time, there
could be little expectation of results.
"Something will have to be done,"
said Mr. Coffman. "The speed ordi
nance is violated, not daily, but hun
dreds of times a day and unless some
one shall ba made an example of the
result is going to be that some of
these fine days somebody is going to
be killed in an auto smashup and the
city will be blamed. There is no use
in the police feeling backward about
the matter; they are duo for a cuss
ing anyway, wbother they do their
duty or not, and they had just as well
be cussed for enforcing the law."
Speaking further upon the matter
Mayor Coffman stated that the third
offense would he considered sufficient
cause for barring any one from the
further driving of auto machinery of
any kind.
Remarks from 'a number of other
members of the council left the im
pression that the council, as a whole,
favors standing behind the present or-
Jdinance and urging its enforcement,

CLASH IN
CHURCH IS
EXPECTED
Radical and Conservative Wings of Pres'
byterians Due for Combat in Gen
eral Conference at Atlantic
City Today
ACTION OF NEW YORK
PRESBYTERY CAUSE
Licensing Graduates of Union Theologi
cal Seminary is Regarded as Chal
lenge; Feeling Between Oppos-,
ing Elements is Strong
By United Press.
Atlantic 'City, May 18. Tho long
expected clash between the radical
and the conservative elements of tha
Presbyterian church is likely to de-
velop at the 128th General Confer-
ence, which begins here today, from
the action of the Presbj'tery at Cin
cinnati demanding that the New Tork;
Presbytery be cut off from member
ship in the General Assembly. v
A resolution was adopted at the last
General Assembly requiring that
Presbyteries admit no candidates who ,
were graduate from theological sem
inaries considered heterodox in their
teachings..
The action of the New York Presby
tery In licensing three graduates of
the Union. Theological Seminary of.
New York, against which this resolu
tion was really directed is regarded
as a direct challenge by the conserny
tives.
The Union Seminary, although some .
of its faculty are members of tho New1
York Presbytery, has no connection
with that body. The other theological
seminaries of the Presbyterian church!
are under the care of tha various
Presbyteries in whose boundaries
they are situated.
One of the conservative strong
holds, although there is a largo liberal
element there, is the Presbytery of
Cincinnati. Under its care is the Lane
Theological Seminary, long a citadel
of orthodoxy. Other Presbyteries
where the conservatives n.re; strong
are Chicago, where McCormick Theo
logical Seminary is situated, and Pitts
burgh, which is sponsor for tha West
ern Theological Seminary. .
The feeling between the New York
Presbytery and Cincinnati Is especial
ly strong because within the territo
ry of each is a seminary which rep
resents the two elements in the Pres
tiyterian church.
One of the leaders in the Presbyte
ry of Cincinnati is the Rev. Dr. Wil
liam McKibbin, the head of Lane The
ological Seminary. He was the pros
ecutor of the Rev. Dr. Henry Preserv.
ed Smith, accused of heretical teach
ings, a brilliant theologian, who left
the uncongenial surroundings of Lane '
and is now connected with Union.
The fight is on between Lano and
Union, between the west and the east,
between conservatism and radicalism.
Owing to the delicacy of the situa
tion delegates to the General Assem
bly at Atlantic City decline to speak
for publication .uincerning it, but do
not conceal that they expect a battle
in the conclave. Whether ts not New
York Presbytery will he forced out of
all relations with the assembly re
mains to be seen.
The indications are that the conserv
ative forces will prevail and that they
nill at least succees in passing a vote
o.' censure upon the New York Pres
bytery for having licensed three grad.
uates from an institution under the
ban of the conservative wing.
If the New York body Is cut off
there are many who think it means
that all its property will go too. This
means that the Presbuterian church
will lose more than 121,000,000. The
church buildings alone are valued at
$18.220,.-:8. The extension committee
represents more than $2,000,000 and
the trustees of Presbytery control
more than Sl,000,00n.
If this transpires the boards of the
church will also lose benevolences of
moro than $lr.OO,000 annually. The
total benevolences last year were Sl;.
574,803.
