John Dostert, Early Ward County Set
tier, Passed Away Following Stroke
of Paralysis—Settled Here in '87.
Berthold, N. D., May 12.—John Dos­
tert, who claimed the distinction of
being the oldest settler in this com­
munity, died Monday noon after an
illness of several months. Although
he had not been in the best of health
for the past year he did more or less
work about the farm until about two
months ago when he was stricken with
f[e
aralysis from which he never rallied,
was taken to a Minot hospital in
the hopes that the attendance of a
trained nurse and constant medical
attention would restore him to health,
but without avail. His condition grew
worse and realizing that the end was
near insisted on being taken home
where he might die surrounded by his
family. ,,
Mr. Dostert first came to Berthold
in 1887 when this was the western
terminal of the Great Northern rail­
way. He engaged in farming but dry
years followed, and he alone of those
who had settled as far west as Lone
Tree was able to hold out. He took to
ranching and herded his stock over
this section until 1900 when the great
influx of homesteaders cut off his
range and he was once more forced to
engage in farming. Since then he
has prospered, accumulating consid­
erable farm property and live stock.
Mr. Dostert was born in Luxem­
burg in 1854, leaving there when a
young man, and after spending sev­
eral years in the eastern states locat­
ed in Grand Forks. Here in 1884 he
was married to Miss Mary von Ruden.
Three years later they came to Berth
old and took up the homestead upon
which they have since resided.
He leaves a widow, seven sons, Vic­
tor, of Nashua, Mont., Anton of Fox
holm, N. D., John of Lisbon, N. D.,
William, Frank, Leo and Eddie of
Berthold three daughters, Mrs. Wm.
Kohn, Margaret and Rose, all of Ber­
thold one brother, Peter Dostert of
Larimore two sisters, Mrs. Jacob
Dobmeier of Grand Forks, and Mrs.
Kate Pyle of Ballard, Wash.
The funeral services were held yes­
terday morning from the Catholic
church at Foxholm and interment
made in the cemetery near that place.

ULl£D BY AUTO-
Car Turned Completely Over on Bur­
lington Road, Injuring Van Hook
Postmaster Fatally.
John W. George, aged 38 years,
postmaster at Van Hook, N. D., was
fatally injured in a terrible automobile
accident, which occurred on the south
Minot-Burlington road, about six
miles west of the city Monday after­
noon, shortly after six o'clock. Wm.
O'Leary, Minot's fire chief, who was
driving the car, a new Model 38 Over­
land, was painfully cut and bruised
about the mouth and arms. The other
occupants of the car, Martin Holt,
Tommy Rowan and Fred Price, es­
caped uninjured. Mr. George passed
away in a local hospital Tuesday
morning shortly after four o'clock, re­
maining conscious to the last.
The party had driven to Burlington
where Mr. George transacted business
and returning via the south road, with
Mr. O'Leary at the wheel, the car was
traveling along at the rate of 30 miles
an hour. When a short distance east
of the Lydecker mine, along a level
stretch of highway, the car suddenly
encountered a rut in the road and
turned over completely, righting it­
self. All members of the party were
thrown out. Mr. George was sitting
in the front seat with the driver and
had turned around to talk to the young
men in the rear. From the appear­
ance of his injuries, he must have been
struck by the wind shield as the car
turned over. His face was laid open
across the nose, the left eye torn com­
pletely out and the right eye cut
across, and the cheek bone crushed.
Despite his terrible injuries, Mr.
George did not lose consciousness and
stood the terrible ordeal that followed
with the great nerve that character­
ize the man. F. Husa, who was on his
way to Van Hook, stopped to pick Mr.
George up and brot him to a local hos­
pital, where an operation was per­
formed, but he could not withstand the
terrible shock.
Mrs. George was notified by ]»hone
and she arrived at 12:30, remaining
by the side of her husband until death
came. Mr. George conversed with his
wife and with a number of hiB friends
until a few moments before he died.
He appeared to realize his serious con­
dition but did not once whimper. He
inquired of his wife concerning the
postoffice and told her she could re­
turn in the morning.
Mr. George had arranged to take a
number of nomeseekers to Van Hook
and shortly before he was ready to
start his own car got a puncture. As
he had business at Burlington, he got
Mr. O'Leary to take him to that place
while his car was being repaired. He
intended returning to Van Hook that
night.
"Wallie" George, as he was known
to his many friends, came to this sec­
tion of the state about fifteen years
ago. He lived at Valley City for some
time and when he first arrived in
Ward county he conducted a livery
barn at Sawyer. He came here later
and was connected with William White
in his livery barn that stood where the
Northwest Motor Co. is now located.
When John J. Lee was elected sheriff
Mr. George became his deputy, which
position he held for four years. He
was a man of nerve and he seldom
failed to bring in a criminal when sent
out for a law breaker.
Four years ago he became connect­
ed with the Jourgen Olson chain of
banks and for a time was connected
I with the bank at Van Hook. A year
and a half ago he became Van Hook's
first postmaster.
Mr. George was married to Miss
Bessie G. Hewitt, Aug. 10, 1907,
Judge Wm. Murray performing the
ceremony.
Mr. George was born in Virginia,
about 50 miles from Washington, D.
C., where his parents still reside. He
visited at his old home during the
holidays. He leaves a brother, Fred
George, of Van Hook, and another
brother in Chicago, who is on the way
to Minot.
Mr. George was a member of the
Knights of Pythias lodge of this city.
He was well known thruout this sec­
tion of the state and leaves a host of
friends who extend sympathy to his
grief-stricken wife.

Athletic Meet at the Model School.
Over fifty boys will take part in the.
athletic efficiency contests to be held'
at the Model school of the Minot Nor­
mal on Friday afternoon, May 19.
That considerable enthusiasm and in­
terest have been worked up is shown
by the time and effort the boys are
using in practicing for the event. Not
only are the boys interested, but the
girls have also taken sides and will
be on hand to cheer for their favorites.
The two teams, Reds and Greens,
seem to be so evenly matched that the
result of the match will be undecided
until the last event is finished.
The meet will be under the direction
of the Department of Physical Edu­
cation with the students acting as of­
ficials and in this way getting genu­
ine practice work in conducting ath­
letic contests.
The events will be: 60-yavd dash
220-yard run standing broad jump
running high jump pull ups (chin

A similar meet for the girls will be
held on May 25.
Youth Gets Four Years for Rape.
A Burlington lad, who has been in
more or less trouble, was arrested last
week, charged with committing the
crime of rape in the first degree on a
fifteen-year-old Burlington girl. He
pleaded guilty before Judge Leighton,
who sentenced him to serve four
years in the penitentiary. He was out
on parole at the time, for a crime
which he committed a year or so ago.
Father-in-Law Died in Missouri.
Paul C. Evans of Torning township

farmer and had resided in Saline
county nearly all his life. Death was
due to an affection of the heart.
Norwegians Will Build Church on
South Prairie.
The Saron Norwegian Lutheran
congregation will soon start the erec­

cemetery, close to the M. O. Hulberg
farm, ten miles south of Minot. Plans
are being made for a building 32x48
feet with full basement and the work
will be started as soon as the farmers
are thru seeding. The church will be
worth in the neighborhood of $3,000
when completed. Rev. Mr. Lonne, pas­
tor of the Bethania Lutheran church of
Minot, is in charge of the Saron con­
gregation.

John Nelson of Ambrose Employs Mi
not Attorneys to Hold Up Issuance
of Bonds for New Court House.
John Nelson, of Ambrose, thru his
attorneys, Greenleaf, Wolledge &
Lesk, of Minot, has started an action
against Divide county, E. M. Truax, O.
K. Otterson and Frank Bakewell,
commissioners, and W. E. Vadnais,
county auditor, to restrain them from
issuing or disposing of the court
house, setting out that the election
was illegal for various reasons. The
ballots did not show the rate of inter­
est the bonds should bear that the no­
tices of election did not state time
election was to be held, and that in
three precincts, no ballots had been
distributed that the ballots provided
for a $50,000 bond issue while the
posted notices called for $60,000 that
the defendants intended to have sep­
arate sites for the jail and court house
and that the notices combined them.
The matter was originally brot be­
fore Judge Leighton, but the plaintiff
took a change of venue and defend­
ants were ordered to appear before
Judge Hanley of the 12th Judicial dis­
trict at Minot on May 17.
Berthold Man Charged With Grand
Larceny.
Horace Randell of Berthold was ar­
rested Tuesday charged with grand
larceny. He is charged with steal­
ing merchandise from G. N. express
cars and from the merchants of that
city. A suit of clothing, stolen from
a merchant in November, was found in
his possession, it is said. He has prac­
tically admitted to having stolen the
merchandise and will probably plead
guilty and take his medicine.
HIT ITCHEST IK
GMDINC CONTEST
Three Graders Building Three Miles
of Good Roads at Cost of |Pf Per
Mile—Attracted Large
The road grading contest- which has
been in progress at a point on the
Burlington road, five miles west of
Minot, all week, will be completed to
,day. Three road grading machines
are in the contest. The county has
hired the McDougall engine to pull
the machines, paying $25 a day for the
engine and $5 a day for the operator.
At the rate the work is being done, it
is estimated that it will cost $85 per
mile to grade the roads, exclusive of
the cost of culverts, or cutting down
hills or making fills. The work is be­
ing done by all of the graders in fine
shape, the roads being fit for travel
the minute the work is completed.
A large number of people have
driven out to watch the operations,
which are very interesting. The coun­
ty will invest in four graders at the
conclusion of the contest and may buy
more than one kind of grader, as all
are doing first class work.
Three miles of the road are being
put into first class condition. The
commissioners will see that this
stretch of highway is dragged after
each rain, and some'graveling will be
done where needed most. The new
graders will be placed at Minot, Ken
mare, Ryder and Berthold and can be
used by the townships in building
county roads.
The contest was brot about by the
claim of the representative of the
Adams grader that his machine would
move twice as much dirt in a day as
either of the other machines. The rep­
resentatives of the other graders "riz"
right up and declared that it could not
move as much dirt.
The Western grader, with John J.
Jackson in charge, made the first test,
grading 1800 feet with 11 1-2 rounds
in 6 1-2 hours. This grader sells for
$550.
The Adams grader, with Mr. Bab
cock in charge, graded 3300 feet in
less than 7 hours, making nine rounds.
The machine throws the dirt to the
center very rapidly. The grader costs
$780.
The Russell grader, with W. O. Gor­
man in charge, is at work today. At
this writing we have not learned the
result but this is one of the best
graders on the market and it is cer­
tainly doing some classy work. This
grader costs $700.
New Optician at Winters Jewelry
Store.
J. H. Ayer, who has been connected
with the Stanton Optical Co. of Min­
neapolis for fourteen years, has ac­
cepted a position as manager of the
optical department of the Winters
Jewelry Co. Mr. Ayer is a first class
optician. The optical business of the
Winters Co. is growing very fast. This
is one of the most complete plants of
the kind in the state.
New Cigar and Candy Store.
Phil W. Myers has returned from
Minneapolis, where he was buying
fixtures for a cigar and candy ?tore
which he will open in the front por­
tion of the Arcade. Theatre. Mr
Myers will conduct ii'ce up-to-date
place which, like all of lis other en­

ENJOIN LEAGUE
Former Socialist Leader of North Da­
kota Says Organization Has Un
dermined Socialists.
Arthur LeSueur, dean of the law
department of a Socialist college at
Fort Scott, Kansas, was in the city
on business Saturday. Mr. LeSueur
seems pretty well worked up over the
success of the Non-partisan league in
the, state and hopes that something
can be done to undermine the organ­
ization.
In conversation with a representa­
tive of the Independent, he said, "I
woAld like to see the League enjoin­
ed."
"How would you go about it?" he
was asked.
"Oh, well, enjoin them on any old
pretext. Go after them on the
grounds that they had violated the in­
tent of the primary election law. Fig­
ure out some excuse or other—any­
thing, just so we can get their goat."
We explained to Mr. LeSueur that
we were not particularly anxious to
see* the League undermined, that it
was a farmers' organization and that
we hoped it would succeed in doing
much good for the farmers.
"It's a pretty note that after I have
worked for many years building up a
Socialist organization in North Dako­
ta, spending thousands of dollars, that
within a few months most of my good
work can be undermined," he said.
"Why, the league has stolen my thun­
der and many of our best leaders.
Thore appears to be only a few of the
old''guard left," he said. "But at any
rate, I will have to say that wherever
they have stolen one of our Social­
ist leaders, they have secured a live
wire and a man with brains," he
added.
H-ELECTION
Legislator From 29th District Who
Championed Good Roads in Last
ife. Assembly Will File Petitions.
C. A. Grow, who was a member of
the last legislative assembly from the
29th district, has announced his can­
didacy for the nomination at the June
primaries.
Mr. Grow was chairman of the com­
mittee on highways. He introduced a
number of good roads measures and
became the champion for legislation
C. A. GROW.
pertaining to the improvement of our
highways. Mr. Grow has taken a
prominent part in the building of good
roads in North Dakota and would be
a very valuable man in the legisla­
ture at this time. Mr. Grow's friends
predict that his candidacy will meet
with the approval of the voters of the
district.
THE HORSE COLLAR.
The horse collar should fit snugly.
It should not pinch at the crest of the
neck and there should be room enough
between the collar and lower part of
the neck to admit the hand freely
when not pulling. The contact sur­
face of the collar should be smooth
and plastic and distributed over as
much bearing surface as possible. The
incrustations that form on a collar
should be removed daily to prevent in­
creased friction. Sweat pads or false
collars should not be used except in
cases where the animal has been galled
or has a collar boil and in this case a
window should be cut in the pad so as
to prevent the bearing surface of the
collar coming in contact with the in­
jured part.—S. O'Toole, North Dako­
ta Experiment Station.
DRESSING PERCENTAGE.
The average dressing percentage of
hogs is 5 while of cattle it is 53 and of
sheep 48. Part of this difference is.
due to the method of figuring. In the
case of hogs the hide, head and feet'
are included in the carcass weight,!
while in the case of cattle and sheep
the head, hide and feet are not in­
cluded. Then the hog is very thick
fleshed and has a small digestive sys­
tem. Cattle and sheep have large
paunches and digestive systems. Sheep
press out lowest due to the wool and
the rather light fleshing of the car­
cass.
The dressing percentage of animals
of each class varies widely. This is
due to the amount of flesh, especially
fat present on the carcass and some­
what to the thickness of the hide and
size of the heads and legs, and to the
amount of fill or the amount of feed
and water present in the digestive
tract at the time of slaughtering. For
the hogs the dressed percentage var­
ies from 65 to 85 per cent with an av­
erage of 75. For cattle it ranges from
48 to 70 per cent with an average of
53 and for sheep from 44 to 56 per
cent, with an average of 48 per cent.

McCoy Says Weather is Cool in East.
Paul V. McCoy is back from New
York City, where he went in the in­
terests of the McCoy department store.
Mr. McCoy bought the summer stock,
for the store for the various depart­
ments, securing fine lot of merchan­
dise at good prices. The business of
this concern continues to grow right
along and it is becoming a larger task
to select the stocks.
Mr. McCoy states that thruout the
teritory thru which he passed, he
found a cold, backward spring and
says the farmers are just as far along
in the Minot country as they
a-e
in
the eastern states. They are farther
along1 with their work than those of
the Red river valley.

TOWN Cites ClIIB
TO BE ORGANIZED
Men Interested in Good Advertising
Will Organize Club for Study
of Problems.
A number of our business men met
at the Association of Commerce office
rooms Monday evening and talked
over the feasability of organizing a
Town Criers Club. B. N. Lesk, who
has been a member of the Fargo Town
Criers Club for a number of years,
explained the working of the club and
the great benefits that would accrue
to its members.
The cardinal principles of the Town
Criers Club are as follows:
To promote interest in advertising
and kindred subjects.
To encourage and countenance only
truthful, upright and clean advertising
and advertising methods.
To maintain and improve, so far as
may be in its power, the standard of
advertising done in this community.
To assist any public organization in
planning its publicity work.
To provide such other entertainment
for its own members and the public as
may seem wise to the officers and
members.
The very nature of the business of
an advertising club promotes co-oper­
ation and friendship among local bus­
iness men. Most of the meeting pro­
grams provide general discussions, in
which the members exchange personal
experiences. The club meetings soon
become experience meetings and the
confidential relationship thus estab­
lished is certain to produce closer
friendships and a better feeling all
around.
In many cities the Town Criers Club
is to all practical purposes the adver­
tising manager for the community.
The word "Truth" stands out boldly
in the tenets of the club, and the peo­
ple who buy their merchandise in Mi­
not will soon know for a certainty
that when they read an advertisement
in any of our local newspapers that
they can fully depend upon the truth
of the statements made therein.
It is expected that from the start
there will be a membership of up­
wards of fifty earnest business men.
The organization meeting will take
place next Monday evening, May 22nd,
at 8 o'clock, at the office of the Asso­
ciation of Commerce.
Any inquiries may be directed to the
Secretary of the Association of Com­
merce, who will be only too glad to
give all information possible.
