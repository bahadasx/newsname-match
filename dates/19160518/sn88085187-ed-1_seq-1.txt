Alienation Lawsuit
EVERETT, May 18. — A
surprise was sprung by the
plaintiff in the l.yen «50,.)00
alienation suit. In superior
court., when Attorney Hart
challenged all testimony
which the defense proposed
to submit to prove that the
reputation of Ksther Aldeen
I,yen was bad before her
marriage to Cecil l.cvi-
Lyen.
"Lewis knew what she was
when he married her," he said.
"Mr. and Mrs. Lyen knew what
she wan when they forced Lewis
to marry her. All marriages are
equal under Ihe law.
"I can cite your honor a num
ber of cases to prove my conten
tion that these defendants can
not now start out lo prove a
thing they believed to be true
when the mariage look place.
"When they consented to the
marriage, they condoned all these
things they are now charging.
He Had His Choice.
"Lewis had his choice of going
to the penitentiary or marrying
the girl. He chose the latter.
"He has cheated the peniten
tiary, and now he tries to client
Justice by trying to bedraggle
this girl's reputation and Justify
ing his acts."
Judge Ralph C. Bell sustained
the objection in part. Later he
allowed testimony to be taken to
test the veracity of Mrs. Esther
Lyen.
A Fraternity nrother.
Jay Dootsou, the first witness
called by the defense, told of sev
eral episodes In which he thought
Aldeen Wilson acted in a manner
unbecoming a lady. On cross-ex

JULY 4
Taroina's big preparedness
parade will happen July 4,
during the Montainnra Festo.
This 'i'as practically decided on
today after mem hers of the Ta
coma branch of the Northwest
Businessmen's Preparedness
league had conferred with the
Festo committee of the Commer
cial club.
The plan of Stephen Appleby
and other members of tho league
at first was to hold a big Clti
»ens' parade entirely separate
from any organization or event,
Just as was done in New York.
Later, however, it was decided to
kill two birds with one atone and
make the demonstration of Ta
conia'B demand for preparedness,
the big event of the Festo.
The Preparedness league will
appoint a committee some lime
this week to work with the Festo
committee in the plans for the
parade.
"Not less than 10,000 in line,"
will be the slogan.
Franklin Fogg, member of the
Preparedness league, today was
named director of the event.
The Commercial club, business
men, patriotic, civic and fraternal
organizations are planning to get
together to make it the biggest
parade ever held In Tacoma.
All patriotic citizens who have
legs will fall in line.

The letters so far received in answer to the question, "Shall the

must be another side.
Or are we to infer that the people who don't like the mayor would
ship him to Washington to get rid of him?
To date the preponderance of opinion is that Mr. Fawcett would make
a good congressman*, a far better than Albert Johnson, that he could be
elected off-hand, that Tacoma can.spare him as mayor under the circum
