with little trouble if he were un

opinion written by Justice Turner of

live stock and a mortgage was given
on them as security for the loan. It
was also condition that the live stock
should be insured una the Insurance

IRELAND ARE GONE
Premier Asquith Predicts
Passing of Old Order
After Yisit to Erin.
.'BLIN, May 1 '. Premier As
qulth has reached the conclusion
from impressions gathered during his
Irish visit that the old form of gov.
ernment in Ireland has had its day,
The Associated Press learns from
sources In the closest touch with the
premier that Mr. Asiiulth's conversa
tions and conferences have convinced
him that the future government must
be conducted on an entirely differ
ent system.
The prime minister has taken care
to learn the ideas and views of many
persons other than these in purely of
flcinl circles. And these persons have
offered greatly varied suggestions.
None of these, It Is believed, will be
adopted In its entirety, but if Is
thought they might be welded togeth
er to form u proposal to lay before
the cabinet. The premier himself
does not know what form his pro
posal evcntuuPy will take and in fact
!t probably will bo fully developed
onlv at the cabinet meeting.
His Belfast visit gave a good hint
to tho premier thul the Ulsterlte
would not accept a direct proposal
Implying home rule. But It is be
lieved they might bo Induced to enter
Into a concerted p'an which possibly
could be arranged to meet their most
serious objections. .

From Paying Bill.
Specitl to Tha World.
OKLAHOMA CITY, .lay 17. Suit
to lest the constitutionality of thu
new registration law passed, by the
special session of tho legislature was
brought today in the Oklahoma
county district court by Arthur H.
Geissler. chairman of tho stute llepub
licun committee. John J. Carney, for
mer jtidvje of the Oklahoma county
district court, ns n Democrat, but re
cently having Joined the ranks ot the
Socialists, and .1. T. Mckerson. mem
ber of the last legislature, appear as
attorneys for Mr. Gelssler.
The action is an injunction to re
strain the county commissioners or
other officers in paying claims for
printing against tho county arising
under the law, Tor registration blanks
and other matter consentient upon the
registration authorized under the law
of which tho constitutionality i at
tacked:. It is claimed that the law
is unconstitutional, and, If so, then
claims for printing should not bo paid,
as it will place a further burden upon
the taxpayers of the county.
I,uw Xo. Hood.
It Is claimed that tho law Is null
nnd void for various reasons. In the
first pi ice appointment of county
registrars is placed entirely in the
hnnilH of the secretary of the state
election board who Is such secretary
only by virtue of the fact that he is
secretary of the taie senate, and that
he is secretary of the senate only by
appointment of that body. Under thu
registration law he Is given great
rower and other duties not contem
plated by an act that makes him sec
retary of the scnu'e. aid. therclore,
ho is filling another position without
being placed tin ier additional oath or
authority of office.
The law is declared unconstitutional
becauso It seeks to place power In
the hnnls of the county and precinct
registrars to strike from the registra
tion list uny voter at the whim or ca
price of the registrar, and that this
authority Is only apparently conveyed
to him through the secretary of the

SAN ANTONIO, Texas, May 17.
An early withdrawal of tha
dlmiinltlve punitive expedition di
rected by Colonel Frederick Sibley
south of lloiiiillus was indicated at
department headquarters today. The
rescuu of Jcsso Iieemer, the store
keeper, and Monroe Payne, the negro

border by bundlts when they raided
Glenn SprliiKs and ltoiiilllus 12 days
ago, was reported toduy by Colonel
Sibley, who received his Information
from Major l.anghorne, and reported
that he was endvuvorliig to overtake
the bandilH who had eluded him ut
F.I Pino, from where he sunt tho re
port and where he found Heenior und
Payne.
Officers here regarded us probable
that u successful encounter with the
bandits would bring the expedition to
an end. and not at ull improbable that
failure to overtake them would also
he followed by a recall. It was ex
plained at headquarters ;hat the
troops of raalry and tho muchliiQ
gun company operating unjer Col
onel Sibley south of thu border was
altogether in a debate for extended
operations and that further pursuit
of the, bandits was unlikely.
Left Prisoners.
Heemer and Payne bad been left
at Ml Pino by the retreating bandits
with instructions to the residents that
they be killed if an attempt to rescue
them was made. The residents of the
village refused to obey instructions,
piofcsKlng their friendliness to the
Americans when they entered tho
town yesterday morning.
Kcports from General Pershing;
were characterized as routine.
