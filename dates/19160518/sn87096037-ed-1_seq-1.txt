KEEP PUCE CLEAN
$0 FLIES WONT
BOTHER YOU
If you want to be rid of the fly evil
this summer get the habit, of keeping
your premises clean. Once you get
the habit It won't be much trouble to
do so.
Dr&ln your garbage, wrap it in pa
per and put it in a metal bucket with a
fly-proof 11 d.
Every day or
two burn or
bury this gar
bage or have
it a
away.
If you keep a horse, don't have
a manure pile or bin. Put the ma
nure is a small receptacle—eay, a
tin tub or a barrel which can be kept
covered from flies. Have this taken
away and Bpreerl on a Sold oftoner
than once a week.
If you have an outdoor toilet, sea
that the vault is closed tight where
the house fits, over it. Use ood to make
it so if you c&nnot get eemant. Use
plenty of lime on the sewage and keep
covers on the seat holes
Keep your house screened, keep a
swatter handy and keep your eye
peeled—for during cold or rainy
weather a few flies almost surely will
wander in. Vigilance and action on
your part will so discourage the flies
after one or two seasons that they
will keep away from your premises.
Tell this to your neighbors and urge
them to join you in the campaign
against the fly pest. Pretty soon oth
ers will see the advantage of sanita
tion, and if there's any "git-up-and-glt"
in the neighborhood It will not be long
until everybody in your end of the
town will have the sanitary habit.
It is not expensive to get rid of
flies. There are people who may feel
they cannot afford to buy a garbage
can or other little necessities of clean
premises. Where there's a will there's
a way. If you cannot afford today to
spend any money, eet your mind on
cleaning up the place ana do the best
you can. Use such extra tubs and
buckets as you have at hand. Above
all, don't be lazy. Clean up right I I
School Children
Should Fight9Em
The schools must help in the cam
paign against flies. Each of the vari
ous grades should take a particular
part of the work, says a writer in the
International Harvester company bul
letin. Let one grade canvass the town
and enlist the groceries, meat shops,
restaurants and householders in a
movement to clean up alleys and back
yards, provide for proper disposition
of garbage and for sanitary outhouses.
Another grade might make fly traps
and sell them to the various grocers
and butchers for use at their places of
business and to the city authorities for
use in public places. That was done
successfully in Holland, Mich., last
year.
HOW TO MAKE A FLY TRAP
Still another grade may collect all
the information which can be secured
on the subject of flies. AH grades
may write compositions on "The Fly,"
"The Ply's Travels," "Confessions of
a Fly," "Dangers of a Housefly," and
similar subjects. Prizes may be of
fered for the best essay from each
grade.
GOOD FLY TRAP
How.to Make It.
One way to control the fly is
to catch it in such a trap as
is shown above. The trap may
bo placcd near the garbage can,
or any other place that the flies
are suro to come. A simple
and effective trap may be made
from a grocery box by substi
tuting wire netting for the top
and two sides, cutting a round
hole in the bottom and inserting
in it a wire netting cone with
an eighth-inch opening at the
bottom and a half-inch opening
at the top. Some articlo of
food, preferably a fish head,
should be placed insido for bait.
The trap must be elevated sev
eral inches above the ground, so
as to give the flies a chance
to enter. When the trap is full,
it may be emptied by shaking
its contents through a small
opening, ordinarily closed by a
sliding door. The trap described
'and shown-in the illustration is
a particularly effective one, as
it was planned with a view to
the fly's habits. The odor of
food leads the fly to enter the
trap at the bottom. Once inside
it is attracted to the top by the
light. When It gets out of the
wire cone it cannot escape. The
trap has the additional virtue of
being inexpensive. It may be
made at a cost of about twenty
cents and about a half hour's
time.
Get a aoap box of large size. Substitute wire netting for the top and two
aide*. Cut a round hole in the bottom and insert in it a wire netting cone with
a one-elghth-lnch opening at the bottom and a half-Inch opening at the top.
Place a fish head or piece of food Inside for bait. Elevate the trap a few
inohea from the ground so the flea rosy enter. When, thf trip If crowded kill
|he flies with boiling water.

DEATH'S MESSENGERS
BE WISER, NOT SAD
Here's the Story of a Mossback
Who Was Stubborn.
Your Help Needed In Teaching This
Community Dangers From Flies
Which Spread Disease.
Once there was a man in this town
who thought the germ idea was "all
bunk." He declared up and down that
it was a fad of the doctors and a
scheme to scare people out of their
wits and make money playing on their
fears. He is wiser than he was nine
years ago, but the lesson was expen
sive and sad—he lost one of his chil
dren with scarlet fever because he
thought the disease wasn't catching.
This is an enlightened community,
but there are still a lot of people here
who pooh-pooh all the fuss we're mak
ing about the fly danger. They jeer
and insist it's the work of a bunch of
slick doctors and fool women who
ought to be home minding their babies.
You would be surprised at the number
of ntossbacks who think this fly talk
a? af
tntxtvtMSi
is "all bunk," too. A mossback is all
right until he becomes a danger to the
health of the neighborhood by his stub
born Ignorance in refusing to help
wipe out the sources of disease and
exterminate disease carriers.
Make it your business to convert the
mossbacks and get them Into the army
that is to wage war on the whole fly
tribe here this summer. Once they are
on "our side" they will be valuable
fighters because of their stubbornness.
Be a missionary!
KEEP FUES FROM THE SICK
One Fly May Bring Sickness to Your
Family—Take No Chance*.
Keep flies away from the sick. One
fly contaminated by typhoid germs
may fall into a can of milk and spread
contagion through the entire com
munity. Ply specks from flies which
have eaten tuberculosis sputum con
tain certain live consumption germs—
showing that the germs pass through
the fly's digestive tract without losing
any of their deadly character. Deaths
from diarrheal diseases are great
est during the fly season. Don't risk
a case of typhoid, or consumption,
or dysentery in your family. It may
be fatal. It is sure to be expensive.

For the Opening Week
Put Your Shoulder To The
Wheel and Help Start
Things Moving
The Annual Clean-up Campaign
opens in this city Sunday with
special sermons in the churches.
A special program is laid out for
the week but the campaign will
not end then, the good work is to
be continueous and the result, if
everyone takes a hand and does
his share, will be most gratifying,
This annual campaign is not a
fantastic hobby of some deluded
mind but is a movement that will
benefit every resident of Hope,
make the city more beautiful,
more healthful, more attractive,
make property more valuable,
make the people happier and you
and your neighbor more agree
able. Get behind it and do your
.share toward securing these
benefits.
Don't think that if you have
raked the yard and put in a two
by four garden that you have
done all that the community can
expect of you. You have just
started. How about that alley,
is it as clean as it might be. If
your neighbor is mean and will
not clean up his side don't follow
his example, get busy and clean
both sides. And that garbage
pile, you had it hauled out once
but it keeps accumlating. Have
it taken care often as it a great
breeding place for ilies.
No matter how dry the season
is or how hot the winds the weeds
will continue togrowall summer.
The appearance of a very nice
yard can be completely spoiled
by a gowth of high weeds in the
near vicinity. Probably you
don't own the lot but if you keep
the weeds cut down the owner
will not object or charge you for
the benefit it will be to you.
In closing we want to call your
attention to the program that has
been suggested and again urge
you to co-operate in this matter
and we can all enjoy the benefits.
