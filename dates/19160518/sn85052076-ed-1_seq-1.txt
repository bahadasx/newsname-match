Why Look Ahead?
This is the season for hard work. The farmer starts
out in the morning and tois through the hot noon time,
hastening to get in his crops. His encouragement comes
by a thought of the harvest, by and by.
In the same way, parents are toiling for their chil
dren and are encouraged by the thought of what those
children may be in long coming years.
In the same way the student is shutting himself
away from his friends, and fixing his mind on his studies
because he too has a vision of a harvest, by and by.
And so in these and all other toils and follies the
the great law prevails, "Whatsoever a man soweth, that
shall he also reap."
What is a Leader ?
A leader ought to le a person that leads.
A man who rides at the head of a procession is not
a leader unless he actually deckles which way the proces
sion is to go.
The people who really set the fashion and persuade
other people to change their minds, are very few
And such real leaders are often very unopular.
People do not thank the one that shows them their mis
takes !
What Is a Good Story?
Everybody likes stories.
There are good stories and bad stories.
Good stories are of various kinds.
It is a good story if it makes you laugh without at
the same time degrading you. The funny story that de
grades you is always a bad story. If you know such a
story keep it to yourself. Let it die in your memory.
But the best good story is one that teaches us some
thing. It tells us how wise people and brave people have
acted. It shows the big things that can le done. If you
know such a story tell it as often as you can.

Every student should read the de
partmental page this week and be
come intensely interested in the
workings of the different depart
ments as the end of the school year
approaches. It is a good time to
begin to think where you want The
Citizen sent this summer. You can't
because lliey were physically until
for service. This fact stands out
conspicuously when we speak of
preparedness. It is not so much
Battleships, Submarines, Air-crafts
or Big fiuns as Men, w ho are physi
cally tilted to meet the demands of
peace or war that will give to the
uted States th necessary pre
paredness to meet all the responsi
bilities of this government. But while
nine-lenths of our young men are
rendered unfit, through the direct or
indirect effects of the destroying in
fluence of the liquor traffic, we can
not possibly meet the requirements
tt our high civilization, therefore, if
the (rovernment is to be properly
prepared, we must destroy the li
quor traffic.
To that end all patriotic citizens
are urged to attend the State Con
vention of the Prohibition Parly.
The National Chairman and other
National Party Representative will
be present for counsel and assist
ance. The Woman' Christian Tem
perance t'nions throughout the Stat,)
