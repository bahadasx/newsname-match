day.
-Oup big day at the Caudle
Grove wi'l not bo until the 5th.
of August 1910. A day of atrip-
pie nature, a day of Odd-fellow-,
ship, Masonry included, andthej
Mrthdav of .'The WORLD'S .
CRESSET August 5th. 1H90,
The Ed. preached to a larga
Congregation at the Geo. Findley
Grove on last Sunday at 11 O'
. dock, and at C O'clock again.
There was a line meeting and
the best of attention given.
' There was people there who had
1 jiot heard the Ed. preach for 8
years, who said they come to
. hear one more good sermon, in
r their life time.
ed the reply from Germany, to
his recent note to her concerning
her method ot Submarine war
fare, the reply is probably not all
that he hoped for: in View of
the order issued to the Sub
marine commanders, President
Wilson will not ba justified at
this time in breaking off Rela
tions with (iermanv. th6 test
will come if some other
Submarine commander
sink another Vessel without,
making provision for saving;
the lives - of non-Combatants,
i
If this should be done it is
altogether likely that President
Wilson will immediately hand
the German ambassador bis
passports,
There is very close relation
between Agriculture Religion
and Education. ' Ideals of the.
Dei.rj e with reference to all.
Three of them are constantly
cnangeing, and changing in
harmony with tach other, The
fundamentals . of agriculture
Education and Religion are -the
same in all countries and in an
climes they are the most un-
changingthings in this life, and
we are now reichintr the time
when competition between chur
ches because ot different views
on churcn government and
doctrines must cease. And chur
ches confine them selves to, the
great fundamentals, Those
which entef into the formation
of life and Character in other
I words two men theory, -Religion
j must be come broader and
caurcbes Cc-operative instead
of competitive.
While we are passing thru,
this transition; many people will
believe that things are going
wrong that the world is growing
worse instead of better. The
ideals of the past will be discard
ed only to give place to broader
conceptions of Agriculture
Education and Religion.
When in the schools, we will
then educate our children for
the life uriev are to live, so when
more beautiful, more useful and
more satisfying than anything
we bavs yet seen.
We will not give up any of the
great T o.Man Theory truths,
but we'!, shako off the coat of the
One Maa Theory and we will
bring ur . Christianity more
directly to bear on our education
farmine; and on our recreation
