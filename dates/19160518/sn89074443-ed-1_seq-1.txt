In the columns of the publication edited by you the' statement has been made that
tile members of the Nonpartisan League are "partners" within the meaning of the law
and individually liable for the debts of the organization.
W Are you willing to make some effort, for the sake of your own reputation for honesty,
to prove tfcat statement was not a malicious falsehood, devised with the intent to in
i-, jure the League?
IS If you are, the Leader is wilUng to pay you for the effort, and to pay you well.
IF YOU WILL PROVE THAT THE MEMBERS OF THE LEAGUE ARE
INDIVIDUALLY HABLE FOR^ THE DEBTS OF THE ORGANIZATION THE
LEADER WILL PAY YOU Ojp THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CASH.
There are no. strings to this."S5You are not asked to put up any wney.
You say you have been advised by "able attorneys" that the facts are as you state
All right, your "able attorneys" ought to be able to tell you how.to go about it to furnish
conclusive proof that what you say is true. The Leader invites you to do it and will pay 1
ablest attorneys." You ought to be glad to earn this money, because the kind of publi-.
cation you run shows that you need money and shows how badly you need it and to what I
iengths you will go to get it.'
LETT US HAYE, THE ?ROOF THEM COME ANIteGET ^HE MONEY.
