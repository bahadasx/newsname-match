On March Mth, Rev. Oatm Hamblen,

A GOOD TIME TO CLEAN UP.
Now that tho high April winds are
over'and tho weather bids fair to be
more pleasant, why would It not be a
good time for Beaver citizens to ob
serve a general Clean Up Day. Our
streets and alleyB, and too many of our
door yards, are unsightly on account
of loose paper, tin cane and other rub
bish, and are an eye sore to all who
have to look upon them. Our town is
going forward with leapB and bounds,
and we are all proud of tho advance
ment that is being made, so why not
have a little civic pride and make Bea
ver a Clean Town, as well as a busy
one? It would not require a great
amount of work on the part of all our
citizens to place the town on the Spot
less list and the favorable Impression
which it would make on strangers vis
iting Beaver would be enough to repay
us for b11 the labor it would require.
A day or two's work would clean up
every street and alley, then a little in
dividual work on the part of property
owners in repairing fences and out
buildings, painting and otherwise im
proving broken down and tumbled
down buildings about their premises,
would make a new Beaver of the old
town. The Hkhald has spoken of this
matter often before, but we have been
jnablo, so far, to start anything- along
that line. Why not have a general
Clean Up campaign? Such an effort
would be a noble and worthy one for
one of the various ladieB olubs to pro
mote? Which club will take it up and
thereby win for themselves the ever
lasting esteem and appreciation of the
clean town loving people?
We are this week running a piige of
advertising for live, witle-awaku busi
ness people of Beaver who believe in a
clean town and who would be glad, we
are sure, to atlsst in any move toward
a Clean Up campaign. The Hkiiald
is ready and anxious to do our share.
Who will start the ball to rolling?

Acting President Commercial Club
DEMANDS IMMEDIATE AQTION.
During the past week two sales com
panies, one calling themselves the
'Eastern Sample Sales Company" and
the other the "Western riales Compa
ny," drifted into Beayer with 'a stock
of clothing and conducted a fen days
sale. They gathered In as .many dol
lars as they could glean, and like tho
Arab, ''folded their tent and silently
stole away," leaving the home mer
chants to keep up the taxes, support
the schools and churches and subscribe
to other public benefits, while the
"Bales Companies" go on from town
to town, paying little or nothing and
taking trade away from legitimate
business men. Some action should ba
taken, and that at onee, to make this
elass of traveling dealers pay their
share toward the support of the town,
or shut them out. A good stiff city
ordinance regulating such traffic
should be passed.
