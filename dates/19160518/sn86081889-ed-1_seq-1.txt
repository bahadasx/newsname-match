Karris for Congress.
While the returns are yet some
what incomplete, enough has
been learned to make it sure that
Geo. A. Harris has won the Dem
ocratic nomination for Represen
tative in Congress in the Seven
teenth District of Pennsylvania
by a handsome majority. He
even carried-his opponent's own
home county, and if yesterday's
vote is any index to Mr. Harris's
strength when he comes before
the entire people next November
this District will be represented
by a Democrat in the next Na
tional Congress.
Mr. Harris's vote in his own
county was most flattering it
being practically a clean sweep.
This recognition of the worth of
one of Fulton's sons is not only a
compliment to Mr. Harris, him
self, but to Fulton County as
well.
The contest between S. L.
Simpson and Clem Chesnut for
the Democratic nomination for
the legislature- resulted in favor
of Chesnut by a majority of from
forty to fifty, the returns not be
ing all in as this is written.
Returhs from nine districts
show 156 votes cast for Focht and
59 for Williamson. It is believed
that Focht has the nomination in
the District by a safe majority.

A Bible Reader.
Dave You Noticed?
We wonder how many of our
readers have noticed the differ
ence between the man who has
been married but a short time
and one who has been married
several years. You can always
tell a young husband from an
old one. When a man has
been married a few months,
you will generally see him work
ing in the garden or fixing up
about the house and while he
works he whistles, or sings, or
occasionally looks up toward the
window to see if anyone is watch
ing him. A year later he is still
working in the garden but, the
smile has been exchanged for a
frown and he occasionally looks
up towards the house wondering
why in thunder breakfast is not
ready. Another year rolls by
and his looks would sour milk,
but he is still at work, stopping
occasionally to kick the dog or
throw a brick at the cat. The
next year we find him sitting on
the porch smoking a pipe while
his wife does the digging in the
garden. Now just watch our
young men, as one by one they
are caught in Cupid's net and see
if this rule does not work out the
problem correctly.
State Takes Hand.
Commissioners of counties who
have neglected or refused to or
der constables to slay dogs which
have not been assessed and regis
tered in boroughs or townships,
will be sued by the State for fail
ure to comply with the dog laws
of 1893 and 1915. Constables
who fail to kill dogs when order
ed to do so, will be taxed $2 for
every dog which other persons
are employed to kill, but when
the constable kills the dog, he
gets a dollar for the job.
Rev. J. E. Jackson will preach

Fertilization of Apple Trees,
"if you want to secure annual
crops of apples from your trees
it is very essential that you fer
tilize them each year," says Shel
don W. Funk, marketing garden
ing" and fruit expert of the Penn
sylvania Department of Agricul
ture. Mr. Funk says:
"Many people think that fruit
trees need no fertilizer and let
them shift for themselves, which
is the cause of so many starved
trees in this State. I believe
more trees die of starvation each
year than from any other single
cause.
"When mnnure of any kind is
U3ed as feed it should be applied
in the fall or sometime during
the winter, but if you are using
commercial fertilizer it should be
applied about blossoming time.
If you have not yet fed your
tret-s, tliH is a good time to do it
apply your fertilizer at once be
fore you forget about it.
"Trees on different soils of
course require different kinds
and different amounts of fertili
zer and we can make no hard
and fast rules, but by watching
your trees closely you can tell
what they need. Fertilize your
bearing trees so that yo j seevre
an average of from six to t.vtlve
inches of new growth each sea
son; young trees should grow
considerably more than that. Al
ways use a Rood high grade fer
tilizer, which carries from 3 to G
per cent, of nitrogen at d from
10 to 12 per cent, of phosphoric
acid.
"Some varieties of trees re
quire more fertilizer than others
but a safe rule is to apply about
a pound of fertilizer to each tree
for each year in age; for instance
a twenty year old tree should
have about twenty pounds. If
you are cultivating the orchard
apply it just before a cultivation,
while if the orchard is in sod, ap
ply it on top of the grass and the
rains will take it down. Where
the trees are large apply the fer
tilizer over all the ground, ex
cepting; A space of from four to

six feet around the trunk of the
tree. At this point we find near
ly all brace foot3 and fertilizer
does very little good there. On
a younger tree apply the fertili
zer well out beyond the spread of
the branches so that it comes in
contact with the feeding roots.
The fertilization of the 'orchard
costs so little and the results are
so remarkable that you simply
can't afford to neglect.

Solving the Marketing Problem.
The question of finding suit
able and ample markets for their
crops has worked a hardship to
the farmers of Pennsylvania for
many years and in some commu
nities still works against the ef
forts of the farmers to raise max
imum crops. The Pennsylvania
Department of Agriculture is
now engaged in working out
some method of assisting the
farmers in isolated districts to
market their farm products. The
problem of the best means and
method to develop markets for
the products of the farms that
are somewhat removed from the
cities and the market centers is
a big one, but plans that are now
under way are expected to aid
materially during the coming sea
son. With a source of sale for their
products established many farm
ers will work for better quality
and larger production in their
farm crops and the aid that the
Department of Agriculture can
give in finding a market for these
products will mean much more
profit to the farmer for his la
bors. The marketing problem is one
Arhich has the attention of the
United States Government at the
present time through the bill in
troduced in Congress by Senator
Sheppard of Texas. This bill
provides for the establishment of
a National Chamber of Agricul
ture with units made up by town
ship, county and State bodies. In
this way the marketing work
will be organized in communities
md will have the assistance of
che county, State and National
associations to carry it through.
The bill provides that an or
ganization of twenty farmers in
a township can form a unit and
when four township units have
been organized a county cham
ber can be organized. When
one-third of the counties of any
State are organized a State Cham
ber of Agriculture can be form
ed and granted a charter by the
National body. When twenty
States have organized the Na
tional Chamber of Commerce
will become a permanent body.
From its inception the President
of the United States has the au
thority to appoint the necessary
officers and nine members, six of
whom shall be practical farmers.
The work of the organization
will consist of helping to market
the products of the farm and pro
vides that when any member or
township unit desires to offer
for sale or to purchase any agri
cultural product or commodity
related to the farm, they com
municate with the secretary of
the local chamber who shall meet
their demand or communicate it
to the secretary of the county
chamber, who in turn communi
cates with the State chamber
and if the order cannot be filled
there the matter goes to the Na
tional Chamber to provide a mar
ket for the products offered for
sale or desired to be purchased.
This system will provide a na
tional wide market, if necessary
to dispose of the products offered
by any one township or county
unit and is thought to be a big
step in solving tne marketing
problem. The bill is sponsored
and backed by the Secretary and
Commissioners of Agriculture in
a number of the most prominent
agricultural states.

THE LABORATORY.
Little Talks on Health and Hjgicne by
Samuel G. Dixon, 1H. D., LL D.,
Commissioner of Health.
To many minds the mention of
a laboratory brings some haunt
ing suggestion of flickering fur
nace fires and cabalistic signs.
In the first dim morning of scien
tific endeavor knowledge pro
tected itself from ignorance by a
cloak of Mystery. That 'u: van
ished. Science now stands close
beside us ever ready to aid
To the practicing physician the
laboratory has become a necessi
ty. There are numerous diseases
which can be determined with
absolute tccuracy by means of
laboratory tests and with less
delay than is possible without
this aid.
The basis of any successful
treatment must be an accurate
knowledge of the disease. This
is why it is necessary for the
physician to have recourse to the
laboratory. It makes certain
what would otherwise be in
doubt.
With the microscope we can
determine tissue changes which
indicate disease and the chemist
can determine the character of
certain fluids of the body which
are caused by diseases of the
various organs.
O wing to the rapid advance in
medical science laboratory work
has become a speciality in itself.
It is impossible for the practi
tioner in the majority of instan
ces, or even the small hospitals
throughout the State, to main
tain well equipped laboratories
with pathologists.
In Pennsylvania, the State De
partment of Health maintains
a free laboratory to aid the prac
titioners in rural districts and
municipalities too small to main
tain their own.
State Agriculture Nates.
May 1 reports from all sections
of the State show a decided gain
in the prospects of a normal
peach crop over the indications
of a month ago. In Adams coun
ty the center of the peach belt
the indications on May 1 were
for 76 per cent, of a normal crop
against 52 per cent on April 1.
According to reports from all
sections of the State the livestock
is in splendid condition. In twen
ty-one counties the condition is
reported above the average while
in twenty-six counties the condi
tion is normal. Little disease i3
reported and the livestock has
spent a splendid winter.
The Dairy and Food Bureau of
the Department of Agriculture
has started a crusade against
maraschino cherries used in cock
tails and as trimmings for ice
cream "sundaes." It has been
found upon analysis that many
of the cherries contain sulphur
dioxide which is prohibited by
the pure food law.
Reports from crop correspon
dents state that the clover mead
ows, wheat and rye have been
very little damaged this spring
by heaving and splendid crops
are expected.
Farm labor is reported very
scarce and in many sections the
farmers are from two to four
weeks behind with their spring
work.
Reports from various sections
of the State indicate that the El
berta peaches have been greatly
affected by the changing weath
er conditions in Jaunary and Feb
ruary.
