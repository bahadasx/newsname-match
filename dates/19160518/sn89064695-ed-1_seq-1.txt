things, charges that Senator
Clapp's Indian bill needs clearing
up. This is a da?fcardly attempt
to place Senator Clapp in a false
light for dome what the Indians
themselves asked him to do if the
Clapp Act of 1906 is what is re
ferred to, or if it is. to any other
bills concerning Minnesota Chip
pewas all of which he pushed
through Congress at their request
except the Red Lake bill which
was introduced in Congress and
urged by Senator Nelson. The
Chippevyas are apparently all sat
isfied with the work of Senator
Clapp in their behalf, and they
will no doubt demonstrate this at
the primary election next moDth.
It is through the work started
by Senator Clapp that a payment
of approximately $1,300,000 will
be paid to the Chippewa* of Min
nesota this year and put into cir
culation in the northern pirt of
Minnesota, and it is also owing to
his work that the Chippewas will
Joe entitled under the law, which
lias just passed Congress, to re
ceive preference filling the posi
tions in the Chippewa Indian ser
vice in this state the salaries of
which are being pud from Chip
pewa tribal funds.

concpondent knows of anything
that is tM to the interest of the

Congress he should state what it is
and not make any insinuations
that have, as THK TOMAHAWK
knows, no foundation in fact.
It would be a great misfortune
to the Minnesota Chippewas if
Senator Clapp should be defeated

The subsidized press of the Twin
Cities do not hesitate to publish
all kinds of offences against Sen
ator Clapp, but the p-iblic at large
cannot be easily fooled, and nc
doubt feels that it is dollars that
are making such a vigorous cam
paign against him.
Among the recent articles pub
lished by the Minneapolis Journal
is one of the issue of the

correspondents which is signed
under the name of "R* pub

faithful friends in Congress.
It would likewise be a great
misfortune to all Minnesotans who
visit Washington to not have Sen
ator Clapp to rely upon whenever
they go there on business, for it
is to him that they appeal to help
them, and it is 1rom him they in
variably receive assistance.
SAVE US FROM OUR
FRIENDS,
If there is anything which the
Indians of this country desire
more than anything else it is that
their misguided friends should not
interfere with any legislation
which the Indians themselves
want.
More than twenty-four delega
tions from different tribes and
bands throughout the country
were ac Washington during the
past winter and they worked for
the passage of certain bills among
which were the Hastings, Johnson
and Lane bills, but influences were
immediately started by per&ons
claiming to be the friends of In
dian interests against these bills
without consulting the wishes of
the Indians. It was charged that
mixed-bloods and the influences of
bad whites in the vicinity of res
ervation^ were the instigators of
thvse bills. The influences of these
xed bloods and bad whites must
be unlimited since all the delega
ti of Indians that were at
Washington favored^ the bills.
The opposition to these bills has
not vet subsided as is evidenced
by the following report that ap
pears in the Congressional Rcord
of the 5th:
"Mr. Ashurst. I present reso
lutions adopted by the New Cen
tury Club, of Philadelphia, Pa.,
which I ask may be printed in the
Record and referred to the Com
mittee on Indian Affairs.
'There being no objection, the
resolutions were referred to the
Committee on Indian Affairs and
ordered to be printed in the Rec
ord, as follows:

DEAR SIR:
At a stated meeting of the New
Century Club, held May 3, 1916,
the following resolution was unan
imously adopted, and a copy there
of was directed to be sent you.
"Whereas there are now pend
ing in Congress certain bills, in
imical to the best interests of the
American Indians who are under
the care of the United States Gov
ernment, viz, the Hastings bill (H.
R. 108), the Johnson bill (S. 3904),
and the Lane bill (S. 4452) and
Whereas the New Century Club,
of Philadelphia, wishes ever to
stand for the rights of the oppres
sed: Be it
'Resolved, That the New Cen
tury Club, or Philadelphia, con
sisting of about 800 women, write
to our Senators and Representa
tives asking them to study the
terms of these bills in order that
they may become convinced of
their wrongful character, and to
vote against them be it
'Resolved, That a copy of this
resolution be sent to our Senators,
our Representatives, and to the
chairaian of the Indian Committee
of the Senate and the House of
Representatives.'
Very truly,
Marie C. (Mrs. C. F.) Jenkins,
Corresponding Secretary.*'

The Department Against
The Van Metre Bill.
The Interior Department, it is
learned, is not favorable to the
Van Metre bill and will report
against it. This bill proposes to
give the state courts of Minnesota
jurisdiction over Indian estates of
this reservation.
The Indian office at Washing
ton claims that to a great extent
the courts already have jurisdic
tion, and by proper proceedings
may obtain all the jurisdiction
necessary in the estates of In
dians.
ONE AT A TIME.
There are now pending before
Congress three bills of vast im
portance to the Indians uf this
country, namely the Hastings,
Johnson and Lane bills. The first
two named bills propose to give to
the Indians a voice in the manner
in which their matters should be
conducted and also a voice in the
selection cf their agents, while the
Lane bill proposes to abolish the
Indian office entirely by reorgan
izing it.
THE TOMAHAWK has never been
an advocate of the Indian office's
methods, but it must be admitted
that there must be a recognized
head of Indian affairs which must
to a large extent be subject to the
administrative body of the gov
ernment, and, therefore, the sud
den change proposed by the Lane
bill if it should become a law and
be carried out radically might
complicate matters to such an ex
tent as to cripple Indian matters.
It is true that the Lane bill pro
poses to put into the hands of three
commissioners the affairs of the
Indians, and no one can question
the righteousness of Senator
Lane's motives, but it may be
possible that the plan of placing a
branch of the administration of
the government in the hands of the
legislative body may be impracti
cable as the bill proposes to do in
substance the bill proposes to
place the three commissioners un
der the exclusive jurisdiction of
Congress.

fered with the affairs of the
whites, and the former feel it
would be much more appropriate
if the latter would follow this cus
tom by not interfering with Indian
matters unless requested to do so
by the Indians.
There has been much legisla
tion inimical to the interests of
the Indians which the so called
friends of the former have never
raised their voices in protest
against, but when it comes to leg
islation which the Indians want in
order to obtain more freedom in
the management of their own
affairs these friends are not plow
in making protests on the grounds
that the interests of the Indians
are endangered thereby.
The Indians favor the passage
of the Johnson and Hastings bills
probably unanimously, at least to
that extent that if the bills were
submitted to them for their ap
proval the vote would be almost
unanimous if not unanimous
among all the tribes, and many al
so favor the Lane bill, and as they
are exclusively effected, the New
Century Club and all other or
ganizations, and persons other
than the Indians, should not in
terfere unless requested to do so
by the latter through their coun
cils and not through individual
members of any tribe.
White Earth, Becker County, Minnesota, Thursday, May 18, 1916.
If the Johnson and Hastings
bills should become laws it is quite
probable that the vexed Indian
questions might be settled. At
least all the efforts of the Indians
should be fix^d upon trying to
have the Johnson bill passed in a
modified form.
MILLELACGASE STILL
HANGING FIRE.
The MiHe Lac case has not yet
reached a final settlement although
the attorneys for the Indians will
meet the attorneys for the Depart
ment of Justice for this purpose
on the 20th of this month.
Commissioner Sells is taking an
active interest in behalf of the
Chippewas, and is quoted as say
ing that he will allow the use of
Chippewa tribal funds if necessary
to get any additional evidence that
may be needed.
It is not probable that the case
will be allowed to go up to the
Supreme Court of the United
States the second time, and an
early settlement is hoped for by
the attorneys.
Lane Meets Indians, Con

recently, to symbolize to 1S5
Yankton Sioux Indians the mean
ing of American citizenship.
The secretary told the Indian
that the great white father had
sent him to speak a serious and
solemn word. Each chosen In
dian was called from the crowd by
his "white" name, and handed a
bow and arrow and directed to
shoot.
"You have shot your last ar
row," said the secretary. "This
means that you are no longer to
live the life of an Indian. You
are from this day to live thp life
of a white man. But you may
keep that arrow it will be to you
a symbol of your noble race and
of the pride you feel that you
come from the first of all Ameri-
cans."
Calling the Indian again by his
white name, the secretary had him
stand by a plow and told him of
the necessity of labor. A purse,
in order that the "wise man can
save his money so that when the
sun does not smile and when the
grass does not grow ho will not
starve," a badge of American citi
zenship and a Hag were given each
new citizen. Women were given
a work bag and a purse.
Indians chosen for citizenship
are permitted clear ownership to
their share of the tribe's allotted
lands, a step in Secretary Lane's
policy of giving all competent In
dians full control of their affairs.

THE BIG PAYMENT.
The payment of one fourth of
the tribal iunds of the Chippewas
of Minnesota now to their credit
in the Treasury of the United
States is now assured notwith
standing the rumors which have
been in circulation to the contrary
upon the different Indian reseiva
tions in this state.
The Secretary of the Interior
stated to the OhippewTa
delegates
at Washington last week that the
matter would be taken into cot
sideration without delay. The
delegates requested that a coir
mission consisting of Inspector
McLaughlin and others be in
structed to come here and classify
the members of the reservation
without delay, so that the pay
ment could bo made.
It is not probable, howexer,
that the payment will be com
menced before next July as was
hoped for by the Chippewas.
