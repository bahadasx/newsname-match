ADVOCATES OF
SAFETY FIRST
The safely movement which
was recently given additional
emphasis on the Nashville, Chat
tanooga, & St. Louis Railway in
the appointment of a, superin
tendent of safety and the forma
tion of safety committees on eve
ry division of the system, has
been thoroughly organized. Ac
cording to Chas. M. Anderson, in
charge of this work, the same
spirit which was responsible for
the promotion of the movement
has characterized every employe
in his efforts to co-operate in the
decreasing of accidents and the
promotion of safety.
A pamplet outlining the move
ment has just been printed and
will be given general distribution
among the employes of the 'com
pany. -The following appears as
a preface to the booklet: "The
safety movement is an honest one
it is built upon the solid and sub
stantial foundation of right, and
it is the earnest hope that every
man in the employ of the road
will look upon it in that truly
American spirit which places
humanity above everything else
and which will enable him to
whole-heartedly endeavor to up
hold and promote the cause of
safety first, last and always-be-caus
it is for humanity--becausse
it is for economy because it is
riglVY YYYy ,
Eight local committees' have
been" formed representing'' every
branch of the service and at the
meetings of these meh. various

intranet; ui uiia w urK wo men
are assured the hearty co-operation
of: their superior offcers; all
along the line. As a result oL
this co-operation many beneficial
changes have been reported and
...
those who are given to unsafe
practices have been urged to dis
continue them not only for their
own safety, but for the safety of
others;
The' .management has encourag
ed the , , work and permits the
men who attend these safety
meetings to do so without the .
loss of time and with all expen
ses paid. '" V
On the Huntsville division the
men have taken up the matter
of discouraging walking on tracks
with the school- teachers and
the children are, ( warned (jf, the
dangers of this practice which .
has resulted in many fatal acci
dents and considerable litigat
ion. Recently goggles were ordered .
for the men who work at' places
w here eye accidents are likely to
occur. . Bulletin boards will be
put up at the shops and at other'
points where the men may ' be
ddvisedT of the progress the work
and given statistics from time
showing the benefits of safety
and the evils of carelessness or
indifference. . !
