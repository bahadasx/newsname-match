ASQUITH PLANS
NEW IRISH RULE
Premier Convinced Old
(jovernment Must Be
Scrapped.
Dublin, May 17. Premier Asquith
has reached the conclusion that the
old form of government in Ireland hns j
had its day. The Asaociated PfMI
learna from sources in the closest I
touch with the Premier that Mr. As
quith's converaations and confercnces
have convinced him that the future
government must he conducted on an
entirely different ByBtem.
The Prime Minister has leamed the
views of many persons besides offieial*,
?? ese hav* offered greatly varied
suggestiona. None, it is believed, could
be adopted in its entircty, but its is
thought they might be welded together
to form a proposal to lay before the
Cahmet. The Premier himself does
not know what form his proposal arill
evcntually take and it wiil probably
be full> developed on!.. ar -ne Cabinet
meeting.
H . Belfaal "iait gave a good hint to
the Premier that thc- vould
not aceept a flirert. proposal implying
home rule, but it is believed that they
might be induced to enter intu a con
eerted plan which could possibly b*
arranged to meet their most serious
objections.
Mr. AMiu.'r. will visit Cork to-mor
row to gather further opinrons He
has. however, not arranged to see the
politioan*. 'lost of thoae witb whom
he wiil confer are of the literary and
educational clasi-es.
Premier Asriuith was sworn in as a
member of the Ir.sh Privy Council this
afternoon. Thi. ia the first time that
an Kiigh'h Premier has been a min
:ster ol thiR body. It means that Mr.
Asquith ia likely to take a greater
?h_re in the executiv* governmer.t ot
irtland than any of his predecessor.s

SENATE VOTES
FOR ARMY BILL
AFTER ATTACK
Accepts Conference
Measure As "Best
It Can Get."
BORAH ASSAIL4S
MILITIA PLAN
Measure Inadequate, De
clares Lodge?Now
Goes to House.
'Krnam Iha MBaaa Barai
Waahington, Mav 17. I'ondemned as
inadequate, as including plenty of pork
but little real proparedne-s, and aa
rreating a politieal machine in the
militia which may offer as grave dan
gers to th* country as a foreign inva
vion, the army reorganir.ation bill waa
passed by the Senate late to-day with?
out a roll call as "th* best we ean
get."
The bill, aceording tn Senator '"ham?
berlain, provides for a regular army of
211,OOO at peace strengfh and approxi
matelv 200,000 at war strength, and
fot a federalized national guard of
00 at maximum strength. Repre
?ve May says it arill provide a
regular army of 171,000 llgbtiBg men.
The rest will be non-corr.batants.
Every possible angle of the measure
was debated during th* day. beginning
with the nitrate water power grab. and
including Mexico, the rebellion in Ire?
land, the militia lobby's tight against
th* volun*eer army and a doien other
topies of lesser interest.
Soaator Brandegee, of t'onnecticut,
whose amendment when the original
bill waa in the Senate increased the
regular army to .30,000 men, closed tha
debate with a hope that the "(iod who
I. rk* after fools and drunken men will
g? M taking care of the I'nited Statea
m spit* of Congrcs*.."
Talk about militarum. Senator Bran?
degee said. was th* mer* utterance of
parral eriaa. He eommented cau.i
tieally on the beliel of some that a
'?million embattled farmers will spring
to the defence of the Inited States in
event of danger.''
Would Ha>e No Weapons.
"If they do spring," he said, "there
will be no weapona for them to light
with; and even if there were, they
would not know how to use them.
Wbf, some of the men were at Platts
burg a month before thoy learncl I
put their rifles together.'
The militia lobby came in for a ter-;
ritic gruelling from .Senator Borah, of
Idaho. He declared ll would be be'ter ,
to kill the whole bill than to provide
for the militia pay and at the same'
time an increase la the mi'utia, tend-.
ing to build up a politieal machine.
"Insistent and persistent demands for |
additiaaal pay for the militia **e shall
alwaya ha\e with us," declared Senator,
Borah, "il this bill. creating this prece
dent, is pasned. There ia no limtt to
what their demands will ultimatcly
reach. Vou have airradv seen what a
body of ISMIM men can do in the way
of bringmg pressure to bear for the
BBBfrtlBtB* of legislation. Perhaps you
can conccive what mor* than M
men, as provided by this bill. may do.
??Do we want, to take th* atep of
