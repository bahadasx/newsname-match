IS
IN NEED OF MORE
IL
'ht tho Patrons of the Tucumcuri
Pulillc Schooln -
It in my wish to plnco before you
Mmu of thu rensous why wo nru in
such urgent need of additional school
room, and why I think u fifty thousand
dollar bond Issue Ik not in oxcoss of
thu needs of tho diHtrict. It is my
wish to plnco the information I have
regarding the conditions in our schools
in tho hands of the patrons so that
they can decide for themselves wheth
er their children need the increased
facilities which the Hoard has asked
the district to supply.
A bond issue is not a proposition tho
ultimate value of which can be meas
ured in dollars and cents. When a
nf iinmtiti rrnnu tt flu. unlit: ritl
next Friday, May 'JO, to vote on the '
question of issuing fifty thousand dol
lars of additional school bonds, that
man or woman will not vote because it
is in any sense a financial proposition.
Where the question of educating one's
children is concerned, no such increase
in taxation as this bond issue would
incur will stand between parents and
better educational facilities for their
children. The only question to be con
sidered is whether we need tho build
ings and equipment which the Board
lias naked the patrons of thu district
to vote. Parents, it is your children
who are to receive the benefits of these
much needed facilities; and you know
that a dollnr spent on their education
today is worth twenty dollars spent
live yuan from now.
So Oir as I have been able to learn
there arc but two arguments against
thu contemplated bond issue: First,
that under present conditions we do
not need the amount asked for; sec
ond, that we would need no additional
room is non-resident pupils of the
county were not admitted free to our
.schools.
In considering tho nmount actually
needed to adequately ptovido for our
needs, wo can arrive very closely, I
believe, to the facts in tho case by
means nf a littlo study and comparison
In the first place, the buildings at
present owned by the district cost
something less than forty thousand
dollars. Of this amount, little, if any,
was used in furnishing and equipping
the buildings. I understand that in
addition to the twenty-seven thousand
dollars voted to erect and equip the
present High School building, that
some three thousand dollars additional
was required to furnish the basement.
And as far as equipment is concerned,
it is not nt this time properly equip
ped. Judging fitim careful estimutes,
I believe I am not far wrong when I
say that our High School building and
equipment alone cost near thirty-five
thousand dollars.
This building should serve ns a
sltwdnrd for nny eomparisons one de
Ahvt to make regarding what should
it i-xpocted from an expenditure of
fifty thvusnnd dollar" This building
contain- seven regular recitation
rooms with a combined seating ca
pacity .f two hundred and ninety pu
pils, and an assembly room and study
hall witii u seating capacity of one
hundred and lif'ty pupils. In addition
there are two basement rooms, al
present used for the domestic science
and manual training departments. One
of these can be arranged, if not used
by the manual training department, to
seat fifty pupil'. The othei room i
too poorly lighted to be used as a reg
ular class room, anil wn originally
used ns n laboratory. It is now used
ns a domestic science room, and i
very unsatisfactory for thU purpose,
In addition to thu rooms mentioned the
building contains toilets, furnace room
supply closets and cloak rooms.
With prices for material advanced
as at present, it is generally admitted
that thirty-five thousand dollars would
not erect such a building ns our High
School building.
Tho total (.eating capacity of the
class loomK in our present Tiuildings
is about six 'Kindred and thirty pupils,
and our average monthly enrollment
was about eight hundred pupil... By
using only thu buildine, owned by the
district and allowing 'ill pirpils to at
tend school the entire day we would
have had something liku one hundred
and seventy pupils without seat - -
enough to fill fl'o ordinary school
ropms. And when you consider tho
average daily attendance for thu past
year 750 pupils you will see that wo
had morn pupils in attendance every
day of school than wo iinil seats in
class rooms by matter of one hundred
and twenty pupils.
Hut thu two Annoxes on Central
grounds are unsatisfactory, and wore
originally intended to offer but tem
porary relief. In the interest of tho
children who are forced to spend six
hours of each school day in these
buildings tho Hoard proposed to re
place them with looms suitably and
permanently constructed, and proper
ly boated and lighted. Uy combining
tho rooms which should replaco theso
Imildings with thu needs in tho grades
1
TUCUMCARI
SCHOOL
GS
as nlrcady explained, a building of nt
least seven rooms would be required.
In addition such a building should con
tain basement, toilets, cloak and sup
ply rooms, and n suitable auditorium.
Each year the school plays, gradu
ation exercises, and similnr entertain
ments which it is nccessnry to hold in
thu Opera House require an expendi
ture of from one to two hundred dol
lars. This sum could be saved if n
suitable auditorium were available in
any of our school buildings . Tho as
sembly room In tho High School will
seat only one hundred and fifty peo
ple, and hns such small stage that no
entertainment of any consequence can
bo given there. The Hoard proposes
then to include a largo and well ar
ranged assembly room in the build
ing specified above.
Such a building properly equipped
will cost approximately ns much as
our present High School building, and
I think that no one will deny that we
need it and need it badly. You will
please remember that the figures on
attendance given above are tho aver
age for the yenr and not the total .As
was stated in a previous announce
ment thu total enrollment for the yenr
was 1000 pupils.
When tho domestic science nnd man
ual trnining departments were estab
lished in our high school three years
ago they were located in unsuitable
rooms without proper and complete
quipment. witlftho idea of providing
more fully for them at an early date.
Interest in both departments has now
grown so that the present equipment
and rooms cannot accommodate the
pupils enrolled in the High School. In
'idditinn to this growth, parents are
demanding that these subjects be of
fered in the seventh nnd eighth grades
The State Department of Education
has also recommended that the work
be offered In grade below the regnlnr
High School.
The department of science has suf
fered for want of a regular laboratory
and regular npparntus to perform the
required experiments. The state course
of study demands that wo offer gen
eral science, agriculture, physiog
raphy, physics and chemistry, if we
are to maintain tho approved stan
dard in this department of our High
School work. No high school can do
crediblo work, in thoso Ruhjccts with
out n well-equipped laborntory. Such
a laboratory as we need would bo used
by the seventh and eighth grades ns
well ns by pupils in the high school.
Schools all over tho country are em
phasizing more nnd more the import
ance of the study of science. Shnll
we allow our own school to remnin be
hind in this important field?
Athletic games hnveiecome n fixed
nnrt of nil secondnry school life, and
n gymnasium a necessity to the well
equipped high school. Our school hns
made n credible showing In athletics
during the past few years, nnd could
hnvo done much beMer had tho pupils
hnd the ndvantngo of a gymnasium.
Tho Jligh School Athletic Association
spends more than ono hundred dollars
each yenr for a building in which to
hold its athletic contests. This sum
would be saved nnd an added attrac
tion given to the school Hfo by pro
viding a gymnasium for the upper
grades and high school. A gymnasium
can bo of more sorvice to the young
men nf the community than nny other
pnrt of the school buildings or equip
ment. These needs for better equipment
for industrial laboratories for scienco
laboratory and equipment, nnd for a
suitnhle gymnasium hnve become so
imparitivc that the Hoard plans to
build and equip a suitable addition to
the present High School building
which shall bo devoted to these Im
portant departments of secondary
m'IiooI work. Such an addition would
cost very little compared to he re
turns which it will bring t the pupils
and to the community. Any man who
acquainted with present dav prob
lem in education will tell you thnt
the proper development of these d
partments of secondary edurnuon ir
vital to the life of a high school
No man doubts that our school will
grow uipidly during tho noxi five
years. Tho Hoard realizes thnt his
growth is inevitable, and plnn to be
prepared to cure for such an increased
enrollment without having to resort
to the erection of temporary annexes
or the rental and equipment of private
buildings. Thnt is why tho Hoard has
recommended that the patrons of tho
district voto bonds at this time. We
should satisfy not only present needs,
but should also provide for a reason
able period in tho future.
It has been suggested that our pub
lic schools aru overcrowded becnuso
non-resident pupils in thu lotm.y were
admitted without payment of tuition.
It is truu that tho Hoard of Education
admitted pupils from tho entire coun
ty to thu Tucumcnri schools without
tho payment of tuition. There aru sev
eral reasons why this action was tak
en. In thu first place, thu Hoard has
always uxperiencud trouble over tho
question of tuition. Largo amounts
of thu tuition charged could not bo
collected, and in collecting tuition a
Luumbor of enemies woro mado who

KINGING AND CANDIDATES
CAKE, COFFEE AND PIE
Ono of the largest crowds of the
season gathered at Quay Inst Sunday
to participate in a Singing Convention.
The crowd commenced arriving early
and singing began with the school
house tilled to its utmost capacity.
On the outside the candidates wcru
busy with that familiar hand-shnko
and "how ate you" until dinner was
announced and then every man nnd
woman there was noticed to be run
ning for .something, candidates for
a "full dinner pall." Thu table was
filled with every good thing to eat a
person could wisli for, evun big buck
ets of coffee were made at n neigh
boring house and drank by the thirsty
edibles to her city friends until sho
guests. Mrs. McLaren dished out tho
came near losing her own dinner, or
thnt is why sho claimed sho was eat
ing after the rest were through. Mr.
Kitchen, a resident of the Quay com
munity, was the hero of the day. Ho
handed nut pie and cake to those who
were too bashful to get up nonr tho
table. His liberality will never bo
forgotten.
Change of altitude made little dif
ference to those from tho plains or
Tucumcuri. They nil ate and were
satisfied. After dinner singing was
resumed and the candidates passed
out cards to those who looked llko
they had tho right to vote. Ono gen
tleman had eighteen different cards,
but there were more candidates thero
"getting acquainted." It was sug
gested that the candidates orgnnizo
a glut club, but some of them would
rather talk than sing and no doubt
are much more entertaining.
Next Sunday McAlister will enter
tain a large crowd at singing and
County Sunday School convention.

FARMERS HAVE FIST FIGHT
Quite a lively scrap occurred on the
street Saturday and wns witnessed by
a number of spectators. It resulted
in both parties being marred up but
no serious damage was done.
I wo neighbors started quarreling over
cattle getting into the other's pasture
and one told the other that if they got
in again he would take them up and
make somebody pay the damages or
lie would hold the itock. The quarrel
continued for sometime. It wns final
ly taken up by another member of tho
family and business picked up imme
diately. Mr. Gerhardt, who was stand
ing near a big pinto glass window re
ceived a blow from a two-pound pack
age of nails thrown by one of the par
ticipants, ft struck him between the
eyes and scratched him somu hut did
little damage.
I lie fighters were finally .separated
and made to quit their fighting and
will bu tried before Judgo McElroy
next Saturday. Theso neighborhood
scraps sometimes end seriously to
nil parties r.nd nre not good for nny
community.
SERIOUSLY INJURED
A most serious accident happened to
O. L. Stoddard, who while driving the
itig hon-e to the Laundry wagon Inst
Saturday was thrown out nnd hnd his
knee cap jammed.
He had delivered a bunch of laun
dry to the Sandusky Hnrbcr shop and
left the lines so ho thought he could
gather them safely as he had so many
times before. When he entered thu
wagon the horse started off rather
suddenly and traffic was rather con
gested at the bank corner. Tho wagon
struck the lire hydrant nnd over-turned
throwing Mr. Stoddard out and
causing his knee cap to bo badly jam
med which tho physicians say will be
several weeks Refore he could fully
recover, and then perhaps never.
The horse was caught and tho wagon
turned upright without much damage
resulting.

NEW MEXICO NEEDS
200 VOLUNTEERS TO
FILL STATE lEITIA
A telegram was received in this
city from Adjutant Gcnerai Herring
of New Mexico, now station ut Colum
bus, calling for volunteers to fill out
the present companies now on duty
along the border. His telegrum was
addressed to Senator C. II. Alldredgo
who set out ut once to secure as muny
as ho could from Tucumcari and vi
cinity. He wuuts good able-bodied
men utid they must be in good con
dition or they cannot pass tho require
ments of the I. S. This wur busbies,
is not u sick man's rosort and unless
New Mexico furnishes hor purt, which
is very small, other states will have
to bo called upon to protect our own
border.
About ten men hnve nlrcady enlist
ed and will leave for El Paso within
a day or two. Every young man who
does not havu a good substantial job,
should volunteer his services to tho
government, then if there uro not
enough some others must leave their
jobs urn! answer the call. This may
be quite a sacrifice but someone has
to get out und fight for those who
have been anxious to throw United
States into war with Mexico in order
to save some of their personal prop
erty. Mexico is not feeling friendly
toward this country because he resi
dents of thnt country think we nre
anxious to swallow her up on nccounl
of her unlimited wealth in mining
property.
Mexico is shipping soldiers to tho
northern part and preparing for an
attack it is thought unless the lenders
change their wnys nnd then United
States must retaliate.
After tho companies now along the
border are filled to their full fighting
strength then permission will ho given
to organize a company from any place
in thu stnte. Mr. Alldredgo says hu
will havu no troublu enlisting n full
number to -compose n company wHen
the time comes to send n company
from this county.

and was paid in full.
This trouble was the outcome of too
much whiskey in too short a given

Judge McElroy believes that kind of
insanity is punishable by law.
