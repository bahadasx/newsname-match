Germany, through count von

Former Undersecretary For
Ireland Tells of Forma
tion of Armed Forces.
London, Eng, May 18. Hearings
were opened today by the royal com
mission which, under the presidency of
baron Hardinge. was appointed to in
quire into the Irish rebellion and con
duct an inquiry into the responsibility
of the mill! xy and executive of Ireland
in that connection.
The firs' witness was Sir Ma anew
Nathan, who resigned as under-secre-
tary for Ireland after the outbreak of
the rebellion.
Sir Matthew read a Ionjr statement
in which he outlined the formation of
the national volunteers, which he said
would raise an answer aa to the or
ganisation of the Ulster volunteers. He
received a manifesto by a majority of
tne provisional committee of the na
tional volunteers opposing the active
participation of Ireland in the war.
Of 180,000 members enroled pre
viously. Sir Matthew said, not more
than 11,000 adhered to the disloyal sec
tion. The witness also read a manifesto
issued by the disloyal section in which
it was said that henceforth Ireland
should provide for its own defence by
means of a permanent army and a
trained force of volunteers. The mani
festo also intimated a purpose to resist
by force any attempts to compel men
of Ireland to Join the British armv
prior to the establishment of a free
national government of Ireland.
Feared ConMcrlptlen.
In the course of his testimony, Sir
Matthew Nathan declared that the fear
that the military' service act would
be applied to Ireland, induced a num
ber of the national volunteers to Join
the Sinn Fein movement, so that at
the beginning of the disturbances
there 'watt K.000 hostile volunteers
throughout Ireland, of whom J000 were
In DttMta.
Considerable sums of monejf.he aJd.
had been coming rioBTTca.tne
funds being used for the purchase of
arms and the printing of seditious Pa
pers. It was estimated, he added, that
16.000 pounds sterling had been re
ceived from America and paid into
Dublin banks from the middle of Sep
tember, 1914, to the following April
when the money was withdrawn.
Authorities Afraid to Act.
Baron Hardinge asked Sir Matthew
why no action had been taken to pre
vent the Sinn Feiners drilling under
arms.
"We deterred because we were afraid
to enforce the act," said Sir Matthew.
"We deterred practically for political
purposes."
The witness also admitted that h
knew women were being trained to
look after wounded men and that sham
fighting for the taking of Dublin cas
tle was being held. These facts, he said,
also were known to the chief secretary
"It was thought." Sir Matthew said,
"that forcible interference would cer.
tainly lead to bloodshed and that if af
fairs were let alone they might blow
over without bloodshed."

The first reports reaching here of

that it was said that six bandits were
