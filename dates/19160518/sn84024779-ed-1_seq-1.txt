A BALL TEAM?
WELL I GUESS YES
Hankinton Will Qo After
State Championship
This Year
the
RAISED SHORT TIKE
Several Seml-ProfeMlonal Play
ers Already Signed Up
for the Season
R. G- Stock and Mayor Mc
Oonell made a canvass of the
business men Tuesday, sounding
out the sentiment as to putting
a firstclass ball team in the field
again this year to uphold Han
kinson's reputation on the diam
ond, and the fact that about
$600 00 was subscribed within a
few hours tells better than work,
the sentiment expressed.
With this assurance of finan
cial support Manager "Stock pro
ceeded to get busy at once and
has already engaged several fast
players for the season.
Dutch VVilke will be back in a
day or two, bringing with him a
pitcher in the person of Watkins
(not connected with the enforce
ment league) a former Garleton
College player who was on the
pitching staff of Duluth in the
Northern league a part of last
summer.
Peck Kielty, the heavy hitting
catcher of the Havana team last
season, has been signed to play
an infield position and will be
here in a few days.
And, oh yes, Oscar Narum. the
Big Swede, has relented and will
be in the game again this season
and withHankinson printed on the
front of his shirt. No better
.news than this could be wished
for by the most ardent fan.
There are three new men em
ployed in the city who will help
fill in the gaps—Neitzel, Wo*kie
and Mansfield—all of whom have
records that will please the fans.
Then we have the old reliables
who have been the mainstay of
the team for years—Ev- and Slim
Green, Carl Alberts, Tige Barrett,
Geo. Rennix, et als- Cap Denning
declined a couple of offers to play
salaried ball this season and will
be in one of the infield positions
with the locals again.
Besides this formidable array
of talent, there are several of the
younger players about ripe for
the first team—the Cox boys,
Shave Green, Harry Worner and
others of the rising generation.
Practice will begin in a few
days arid the first of June should
see the old game in full swing-
In this connection it is pleas
ing to note that, many of the sur
rounding towns are {retting ill
the name stronger than ever be
fore. Wahpeton will have near
ly nil-salaried bunch, Cogswell
has six hired men for the season
Wyndmere threatens with a
strung aggregation, and even
Lidgerwuod and Fairmount are
considering the matter of putting
real teams in the field.
Oh yes, it. will lie some base
hall year all right, and Hankin
son will ho right in the thick of
the fray from now until the frost,
is on the pumpkin.— Hankinson

BELOVED WIFE AND MO
THER PASSES AWAY
On Wednesday the citizens of
Abercrombie were deeply greived
to hear of the passing away of
Grace, the beloved wife of C. Vv\
Ware. Her spirit entered into rest
just as earth's sun was going

On Saturday a most impressive
series of services were held in her

Earth, as it is in Heaven." He
spoke most sympathetically of the
bereavement and sorrow of the
hour. His words were a great up
lift for he proclaimed reunion
with the loved one gone before. It
was a sermon of deep consola

tine. who had baptised her in her
infancy delivered a sermon from
the words: "The Spirit of the
Master is upon Me. Because the
Master hath annointed me to
preach good tidings to bind up
the broken hearted." The speaker

A COMMUNICATION
To The Editor of The Times:
A great deal is appearing
cently in the newspapers of the
state in regard to the value of
sweet clover as a feed crop for
this country, and people are being
urged indiscriminately to plant it.
I take this means of suggesting
that our people ought not to be
too eager (o adopt this advice
without careful consideration of
possible consequences.
re-
As early as 1911 I investigated
the value of sweet clover as a for
age crop, and in the spring of
1912, procurred a small quantity
of seed for experimental purposes
on the Brook Side farm. Before
planting it I deemed it advisable
to get some authoratitative infor
mation and wrote the agricultur
al college. In reply 1 received ad
vice as follows: "Look out for
your sweet clover so you do not
get it scattered over your field. It
is one of the worst weeds that
can be sown in the Red River Val
ley. Not withstanding this ad
vice 1 proceeded to plant four a
eres, being careful to leave a
margin of uncultivated land a
round it.
The following summer 1 had oc
casion to travel by wagon road
through a section of Minnesota
that seemed literally over run
with the plant. It was growing
around the fields and along the
roads in a perfect jungle as high
as a horse's back. Knowing of its
seed bearing qualities it looked
very dangerou.- to me and I start
ed in the next spring to kill .out
what. I had planted. I have suc
ceeded but it took a lot of effort
fort.
I am not attempting to dispute
any thing that has been said as
to the value of the plant for feed
purposes, though I fear there is
some exaggeration but in the in
terest of our lands. I earnestly
urge that it be experimented with
cautiously, and that any one con
templating the planting of it in
quire very carefully as to the ad
visability of getting it into the
land. We maintain our agricultur
ai college at a considerable ex
pense to investigate such matters
for us, and common prudence die
tates that we carefully heed what
it says on such a subject ai t,hi».
It would he well to keep in mind
that the claim advanced for the
plant is that it is an admirable
substitute for alfalfa and that it
can be raised in places where ai
falfa will not grow, I never heard
it claimed fhat. it was equal to al
falfa in any respect. This part of
the. country having now demon
s'! rated that it is well adapted to
alfalfa, the need for experiment
ing with swei l, clover is not press
ing.
Very respectfully.

TO WORK TRUNK
LIMES THOROLY
Is The County Commissioners*
Plan For This Coming
Summer
VILL SPEND ABOUT $17,500
Commencement of Plan to Make
All the Roads in the County
Good Roada
Two weeks ago the Times re
ported the organization of the
Richland Good Roads Association,
and their plan for the better use
of road funds by annually improv
ing some road or roads instead of
parceling it out in small lots here
and there.
The first roads suggested were
the four main or trunk roads of
the county, namely, the Meridian
Road north and south, the Fair
mount, Hankinson, Lidgerwood,
east and west, road, the Wahpeton
-Wyndmere road east and west
road, and the Walcott road east
and west, from a point on the Me
ridian road west by Walcott to
the county line.
The club based its request up
on the fact that heretofore, the
road work throughout the county
has been done in a manner which
did .not get the best results, or
the most for the money, because
there was not a definite plan to
work on. They advanced the ar
gument that a system should be
adopted for county road work,
and that this system should begin
with the improvement of the main
roads or highways of the county.
After these were in first class
condition. their maintenance
would be less expensive, and more
money could be devoted to build
ing and maintaining the branch
lines which led to the main roads
l'firom the various points of the
county.
This plan evidently appealed to
the county commissioners, as well
it should, and the result was that,
they decided upon the following
plan for this summer.
The Meridian road is divided
into two sections—north and
south from Wahpeton to the
county lines. The work on the
north part will be under the di
rection of Commissioner Tlieo.
Larson the south part will be
under the direction of Commis
sioner W. J. Robinson. It is plan
ned to spend the sum of $6,000
Oili the 53 miles of Meridian road
between the north and south
county lines.
The Walcott road work will be
under the supervision of Com
missioner 1'. K. Sletmoe. This
piece of road is Iweiily-lwo miles
long, and on these 22 miles will
be spent the sum of
The. Wahpeton. Mooreton,
Wyudnierc road will have the per
sonal attention of Commissioner
Koppelman during Ihe summer.
This road is :{r miles long, and
Ihe sum of sij'din will likewise be
spent, upon it.
