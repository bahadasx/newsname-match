Tlart of New Road May Be in Opera
tion in November Bemidji is
Headquarters.
Bemidji will be the headquarters
for a new railway. It will be the
Red Lake Northern railway and it
will be built from St. Paul, through
Bemidji to Warroad.
Opsahl President.
J. J. Opsahl of Bemidji will be
president of the new company. The
first board of directors will be com
posed of J. J. Opsahl, Leo J. Opsahl,
John Moberg, George H. French and
A. If. Bagley. T. B. Walker, Minne
apolis, millionaire lumberman, is in
terested in the new road.
J. J. Opsahl returned this morning
from St. Paul where articles of in
corporation were filed yesterday by
the Red Lake Northern Railway &
Construction company. Capital stock
is $150,000. The life of the corpora
tion is for 99 years.
Take Over Lines.
The new railway will take over
two short lines owned by the Walker
interests as a nucleous for the new
road. One line runs from Akeley,
Minn., to Itasca State park. The
other runs from the park to Shevlin,
Minn Both are logging roads of
only 20 miles each.
The Red River Lumber company,
of which J. Opsahl is manager of
Yhe land department, will only have
an interest in the new road and will
not appear in its corporation.
Surveying crews will start out
about June first.
Survey Here.
The first survey will open a route
north of Bemidji to the Red Lake
reservation Federal laws provide
that only one railroad is to have the
right of way across the reservation.
The new company has already re
quested that right of way and it is
believed will be given in the near fu
ture.
The adoption of the Nelson bill
opening the Red Lake Indian terri
tory to lease and exploitation of farm
products as well as lumber, decided
the Bemidji men to organize the rail
way.
Timber Available.
Mr. Opsahl stated today that 400,-
000,000 feet of timber will be avail
able under the Nelson act. Besides
this, he stated that last year there
were 29,000 tons of hay on the res
ervation which was wasted on ac
count of not having a market.
Mr Opsahl yesterday withdrew as
a candidate for congress in the sixth
district.
A part ot the new railway will
probably be in operation early in No
vember The ultimate equipment to
carry the tonnage in sight would con
sist of 4,200 cars about equally di
vided into freight, logging and com
bination grain and automobile cars.
Two passenger trains of six cars
each, it is estimated, would handle
the passenger business for the first
two years. About six switch engines,
two Mikado type engines for heavy
freight and nearly a dozen general
utility locomotives would handle the
traffic after the complete line is
opened.
